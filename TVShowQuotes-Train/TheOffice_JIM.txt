Here we go. [Meredith's phone rings. Jim and Andy groan.]
Alright, I will, um, I'm just gonna let you get back to that.
God, I don't even, I don't even know how to explain this. Uh, um... Dwight, uh, asked me to be in an alliance. And then um... um... we were... we've just been messing with him. Uh, because of the whole alliance thing. Um...
Phyllis! Grab both these coffees, double-fist it, and head through this obstacle course.
Wait, wait; one thing.  Uh, by tomorrow, you mean Saturday, right?
Can we at least all agree that this is uncomfortable, and may be heading for something bad?
Aw, that sounds like a lot of fun.
You, you are taking about Dwight Schrute. The biggest Wonka fan I know. I mean, you've been talking about that movie for years.
I'm sorry, that just wasn't interesting to me.
Got it.  They're like the penguins of the airplane family.
Ah, gotcha.  Okay, so they have Albert Einstein, Ben Franklin, or Sponge Bob Squarepants.
And this dude labels his food. He's the clean one. And, I'm the messy one. How much fun is this?
Hey, Creed, we covered it. Lump of coal!
There���s a big investment lunch today, so I decided to skip the costume.
���Gotta go! Darth Vader's launching a huge attack.���
And Dwight is imitating Japanese business practices for reasons he explained to us in Japanese.
Well, I tried. [gestures the meeting room] You saw it, so, it's on the record. I have a plane to catch.
[holds up the retrieved lead] It involves you too.
He has not stopped working for a second.  At 12:45 he sneezed while keeping his eyes open, which I always thought was impossible.  At 1:32 he peed, and I know that because he did it in an open soda bottle under the desk while filling out expense reports.  And on the flip side, I have been so busy watching him that I haven't even started work.  It's exhausting, being this vigilant.  I'll probably have to go home early today.
Alright. [Jim's phone rings] Oh, sorry. I'm so sorry. It's my wife, can I take this?
Okay, calm down.  Where was the last place you saw it?
I think if you ordered hot food you're allowed to eat.
By any chance, did you see Battlestar Galactica last night?
[walking out of the building] Hey, do you mind if we make a stop on the way home?
Oh boy, please don't. Let's not let that happen.
Yeah. Sure. Sounds good. I... . [sees Pam in rearview mirror] Hey! You know what? Can I give you a call right back?
Uh��� [clears throat] Well, it���s about Athlead. I���m sorry. Does Dwight have to be on this part of the phone call?
Fair enough. Wow! We should have started dating like a long time ago.
I think it���s definitely��� Well, okay. Either way���
Stanley. Uhh��� you know what? Just bring back those bottles!
Oh, that reminds me. [reaching into golf cart] Little something from all of us. [hand Dwight a small wrapped gift]
I think you got this. Kay? [Erin nods] Alright. Feel better!
Yeah, oh, I know. Looks great. [Dwight throws the purse over his right shoulder and gets back to work]
You know what? Here's the deal, Kelly. It would be really nice if he was in to you, right? It'd be great, but he isn't.
Was it, like, trickery in the lights, or maybe you were so primed to see it, then there it was?
And... that is why we waited so long to tell people.
How about we just... Just have to talk to you for a second...
Andy, Dwight says welcome back, and he could use a hug.
Well it's just that you had no hair on Friday.
Oh! Of course there is. Hey, Chinese tonight?
Only if you tell me what you're writing.
[slinking out of the room] Alright, you are welcome.  I'm going to go because of, um, traffic.
Yeah, who'd have thought? [Pam sees fireworks being set up; smiles]
[On the phone] Right, oh let me just check the pricing list.  Hold on one second...
No. There's no extra outfit in the bag.
Nope. Your friends not turning out to be as great as you thought? Not even Gabor?
Yes. He is. And you know what? We cannot let that happen.
To be honest, I don't know, but maybe I could just yell at him in front of people.
[Michael is seen debating on whether to come back in to the office] Remember that older couple whose kids were also named Jim and Pam?
Alright. [starts walking away, but returns] Oh, did you see my memo by the way?
You know, Dwight, this whole search for the assistant thing���none of these people are good enough.
See, I knew we lost somebody on the tour.  It's-
Absolutely. We can get that out to you immediately.
Yeah, I think you're going to want to cool it with that 'cause it's starting to upset the other salesmen.
[chuckles] Yeah. That's what we're doing. In our very limited free time and with our very limited budget, we went and got a nanny and then we went out and took a class on a very outmoded and very unnecessary form of communication just so we could talk about you in front of you.
Just cut through it, man, it's no big deal.
[sits down next to Denise] So, high school.
Oh, um. [pulls item from bag and hands to Pam] Happy Valentine's Day. Sorry, I didn't have time to wrap it.
Barely, I... I don't have all the facts.  Frank and Bean...
Really?  Do you wanna get back to that?  I could go.  I should go.
Sure.  Oh, you know, while I have you... today I was working on this pitch for a supermarket chain, and it would actually be a big account and I wanted to-
No, he didn't. [Dwight mouthing 'yes, he did']
I'm actually really disappointed in how poorly my book is doing. [holds up same book] I've only sold one copy.
Well, that was apple-picking day and there's no need to yell that day, you know. I was just excited to find the car. Perfect end to a perfect day.
Oh!  See I'm here to learn as little information as possible.  All I really need to hear is if your incredibly successful company would be receptive to a buyout.
[stammers] I'm sorry, is, is this because I talked to Wallace about your website? Because I really didn't mean to go over your head.
Well, for instance, how did you deal with it when two warehouse guys got into a fight?
You know what it���s not my best. Because you could just easily bend over and pick it up right?
[partially blown up balloons on table and hanging from streamers] Are you kidding?
You know, you can just pick it up, take the triple bogey.
Oh, guys. I really refuse to participate. 'Michael, can I have an advance on my paycheck because a Mrs. Fields Cookie just opened up at the mall.'
Okay, I'm Kareem. That makes total sense. I'm Kareem. You're Dr. J. Just sounds weird to say out loud.
I don't know. Hey, have you seen my baby?
The one thing Pam made sure I knew, Florida's pretty loose with the death penalty.
Oh no, I didn't want to see you.  Not that I'm not happy seeing you, right now, I'm just saying ultimately I was here for the copier.  Equal, I'd say it was equal.  So, good to see you...
Here we go. [documentary starts with the first scene of ���Pilot���]
Yeah. I mean, I'm not saying that everyone has to fall in love, or anything, I'm just saying... but you know, to not even call her back is...
Wow. [sees guy at Erin's desk] Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Hey, Andy, I'm really, really sorry to do this to you, but I have a meeting today that I totally forgot, so I can't be apart of this seminar.
I wonder, in this office, who has access to a porcupine?
Yeah. [Pam puts her hand out for an earbud] Definitely.
Will everybody stop for a second, because obviously I'm not taking any of it.  A mistake has been made and we'll figure it out.  Second of all, there was no cash prize.
Listen Michael, I really... I did text Pam, but...
Then tragedy struck Recyclops when his fictional planet was attacked by some other fictitious thing... I can't remember.
Pam texted back saying we could give them all iPods.
Dwight lives on a beet farm and he practices karate at the forth grade level. And he apparently has a girlfriend, so... I guess there really is someone for everybody.
[Michael is wearing a wig that is very close to Jim's actual hair, and he is wearing fake earrings, and speaking in a punk-ish deep voice] I totally don't know where Michael is, dude, hey you wanna listen to some records?
Hey, so how's the direct mail business going?
[on phone] All right, Thank you, I will--I will send the contracts over right away. All Right. [hangs up the phone and rubs his eyes] Whoo! [Erin jumps in the background]
Look its one day, everything's gonna be alright. No big deal. You good?
Oh, you'd understand if you read the memo which I should probably get you, there's probably one in a drawer... uh. It was pretty crazy. But, uh, not more crazy than wearing a tux, at work, I grant you that... so, uh.
Hey, I am wondering if this is a, uh, terrible idea.
Michael, wait. So they said we are sold?
Oh my God. Pam, I don't know, I, nothing, truly, nothing. I mean, I, I just was honest with him and I, I'm so sorry, I don't know. I'll call him again. [Pam rolls her eyes and walks away]
Did you say something about this one bringing in something for these people?
[as he and Pam flip their cards] John Stamos.
The new receptionist is also named Kelly. So Kelly Kapoor has decided to hover around my desk, so that she can run into his Charles' office every time he calls for Kelly. She thinks if she says 'You wanted me' enough, he will in fact want her. It's not the worse plan she's ever had.
Wow! I'm just gonna rewind and back off a bit, so... [imitates a tape rewinding and chuckles, Michael comes over by Jim laughing]
No, no. Of course. Just one quick question. Was this um, Halloween, or...
One second 'cause that sounds really good. Is jackass one word or two? [Dwight sighs] One, right? 'Cause, 'cause of the show, it's one.
Can I talk to you in my office for a second?
You know what? I don't think you need to do things on command. That's very weird. I'll just take that. Thank you. I think we should just wrap up the show, kiddos. Right?
Oh Dwight, Dwight, [Dwight pukes on his back windshield]  Ohhhhhh!
You've got to wave your arms and you've got to pound your fists. Many times. It's supposed to emphasize your point.
At thinking out the options, and then stating that decision very clearly, especially when it's an unpopular decision.
Chapter seven: The host should always present something spectacular to draw the eye of his guests.
Oh no, I just decided not to. How's your headache?
I'll take over. Um, what we're doing here: Michael handles more of the 'big-picture' stuff, and I handle more of the day-to-day stuff, so together...
Oh my God. Dwight got a hooker! Oh my God, I gotta call... well, I gotta call somebody, I don't even know who to call. Dwight got a hooker!
Okay, the limo���s gonna be here at five.  I need everybody to be ready ���cause I want to pack in a lot.
If we can get him to drive to Connecticut... and put peroxide in his hair...
No, I just saw I missed their call. Why? What���s up?
It's not--- It's not about me.  I mean, this your dream.
Oh, man.  You know what?  This might take a while.  You really don't have to stay, if you don't want.
[opens door to Gabe's office] All right, good night, Gabe. Just wanted to say thanks again. [Gabe motions that he's on the phone] 'Cause I really think I made good use of my day, oh! Sorry.
I don't think you're good at making tough decisions!
Rarely.  If ever.  Let me give it a whirl.  I'll talk to them.
Wasn't it...  It's kinda like a...  Like that.
Well, Pam I'm not gonna lie to you, he's chances are none. Um, he's 41 years old, he is losing his hair and his cell phone ring is 'Mambo #5.' So...
Mmm, that's where you're wrong.  I'm your project supervisor today, and I have just decided that we're not doing anything until you get the chips that you require.  So, I think we should go get some.  Now, please.
Hey it's me. So uh, don't worry. Everything's ok.
[laughs] Oh man.  Oh, you know what, speaking of which, I was just trying to get a handle on, you know, numbers for food and stuff.  So do you think that Roy's gonna come, or...
Hello? [laughs] No, I'm just on the phone with this stupid salesman. He's so dumb. Probably just gonna keep him on the line forever and not buy anything. Yeah, OK. [punches button on phone]
You did not have sex with Pam's mom.
Uh, I think you dropped this [hands over piece of paper]
The one I have. I'll use the one I have.
This is great. Got to confess, we came a little early, so we got a quick look around, but, uh -
Now I have this big bump in my lip that hurts. I hate it.
Well, maybe it isn't warm enough in here.
[Jim ejects a videotape from the VCR and puts in a new one] Wow. I don't know how you're gonna decide. They are all extremely good.
Sounds like someone's really trying to convince us that he's not the Scranton Strangler.
You mean Laverne's Pies Tires Fixed Also? [Pam nods] Yes we will be doing that. We'll be getting a dozen.
[in the conference room] Hey Pam, can I see you for a second?  So, Dwight heard you were having a really rough day.  So he generously offered to wash our car.
OK, alright, that's...look. All we were trying to do is we thought we could come up with a more efficient way to do things.
I don't know. I thought that was a little weird. You told me Brian got fired for the whole warehouse thing. And you intentionally left out a kind of major, intimate detail. I don't know, Pam, I guess I just feel like a chump. Who knows less about his marriage than the sound guy.
Now he's trying to get me to bring my children in to work. I think it's fair to be cautious.
I just have a meeting, uh, outside the office.
Oh. You don't have to tell me this.
This is hilarious, but we���re gonna stop with all--
[driving, sighs, laughs] No. you know what? No. Because... I'm not that guy. And [laughs] we are not that couple. [turns around]
[answers phone] Hey! Yeah. No, I got it. Just leaving now.
[Overlapping] When's the last time you upgraded your printer?
Uh hmm, he should be fine, but, uh, they brought him in for a CAT scan.
What the heck? Is that, uh... [bends down, cuts phone cords with scissors]
We are splitting a sublet on a place near Philly.
I'm so sorry, I think I forgot that thing...
Oh, yeah, How have we not talked about this already? I mean what happened there? Kidnapping? [both start laughing]
You're only engaged once.  Well present company excluded, but.
No, no, no, no, no. Uh, we���re just starting couple���s counseling. Uh, which doesn���t sound any better.
My charity is the Lackawanna County Volunteer Sheriff's Department, because Dwight's a Volunteer Sheriff. So I thought this was a perfect opportunity to support/mock him.
What? ... No. It burned me. I... bizarre.
[leaving his desk for the day, pretends pull the pen out of a pretend grenade, and tosses it to Karen]
Don't worry about it. I have a thing. A thing of soup. Which I've been wanting to try.
I know. [Gabe and Darryl stand on either side of Jim with paper and pens in hand]  Just the guys.  Well, maybe that's, uh, part of the problem.  I think...so what happened was, I was talking with some of the department heads.  Uh, some of the female department heads.
Pam.  [to camera] Sorry. [to Pam] Um, are you free for dinner tonight?
Alright, I'll look into it, but the answer's no.
[holding Cece] Spinach in a can. Power eat spinach. [Popeye sound]
We can relax. Let's get our Sweeney on.
Ok, I didn't actually major in Public Speaking. But, I did download speeches from some of history's famous dictators. Like this one [holds up paper]. Originally given by Benito Mussolini.
Well it���s not that easy. It���s kind of sometimes difficult.
[points to picture of Cecelia] We made that.
Is it Elliot? Hey ch... chief, this is Jim Halpert from um... where you work. You're the guy who sits behind the desk... you're, you're the, the Afri... African-American guy, I mean you're. Ah... Who, Who've I got here?
Good morning. [Pam sees breakfast sitting on her desk] Yeah I'm sorry, I looked away for a second and Creed snatched your hash browns.
No, it was not a disaster. It was weird, but it wasn't a disaster. I think we have, like, a gift bottle of Irish cream.
No, no, no! Don't give him mouth to mouth for this!
Oh, hello Mater. Good news: I've married. Tell Fater. [hangs up] Such a nice woman.
I���m doing this just for me? Is that what I���m doing? I���m doing it just for me. If that���s what you think, then this is a really sad night. But you know what? I got to go. Okay?
You know what would energize me? If you, Pamela Morgan Beesly...
Now how do you know how it works?
I have to go to philly. But this was amazing. Okay.
Wow! I do not parent for the award but I gotta tell you It feels pretty good. Uh, Cece, if you're watching this at home it's way past your bedtime, by the way how'd this get televised?
Alright.  Wait, what are you planning on doing?
Let's go driver! [clapping] Laverne packs up the pie wagon at five so...
Oh do you mean when I get the job?
Is it me, or are we just a little off today?
Forget it. It's just a dry erase board.
That's why we're all going out. So we can have an end-of-the-week-drink.
Hi, all right. I'm just going to go down to the car and I'm going to put her in her seat and I'll be right back up.
Oh we were just... talking about, bureaucratic stuff...
Oh, can't go today, 'cause I'm donating blood.
I've always gotten along well with Toby.  Uh, we're friends.  But I don't think we'll stay in touch necessarily.  I think I'll probably get updates on him from Pam.
And two, that stuff that happened with you and Angela is a bummer, and I know you don't think you're ever gonna find someone else, but you will. I promise you, you will.
[pointing to computer monitor] So, we've typed in the address, now let's take a look at the street view. [picture of Dwight and Mose on a see-saw]
I mean I guess-- I guess I could go down there and try to nudge them in the right direction.
OK, well, if you've never been sick, then you don't have any antibodies.
Yeah, well, you know just had a meeting. Squash meeting.
No. Okay. Um, I���ll take a photo of it. Dwight, can you throw me my phone?
Well, I can't tell you cause it's a secret.
Yes, well I want to stress test it. You know, in case anything happens.
That's actually a good idea.  We'll all take a brief intermission. [To Pam]  Hey, are you hungry?
Alright, Great Scott, if you found that choking hazard poster, just head on home.
You have what is the national sport of Icelandic paper companies. And I'm blanking on the name, can you help me out Pam?
Question, if we already fomented insurrection, may we be grandfathered in?
Okay, so I know about most of these, but you know you can...
Well, you know how much I appreciate the opportunity to hang out with your mom more. So let me just put this in my calendar.
Just a simple macro. You know, these actually don't sound that funny one after another. But he does deserve it, though.
Hey! How are ya? I thought you left?
Why's it smell real? [Pam shows him a hidden car-freshener] Ah... good one.
You know what? Maybe we should cancel that bottle of wine tonight.
Why do you have the Big picture up again? You used that already, when you burned your foot.
So. Uh... I am going on a trip. But not really sure where I'm going yet. It's kind of open-ended. So I was hoping maybe you guys would have some suggestions?
And for my next trick, I will make my career disappear.
[enters] Okay, so the consensus was that that was unique. They���re going to make you pay for the fish, and��� they wanted to know when you can start.
He's going to be a lot of fun to drive around in a car with.
Oh, one hundred percent.  We all want to see you tattoo your ass.
[waiting outside the bathroom for Pam, he is holding a hand-picked bouquet of flowers and pacing] These are for you.
You could just be saying it to get the job.
There���s a very exciting opportunity to be a core investor ���
It's not a big deal. I'll come visit you. And you'll visit me. It's only two hours away. It'll be fine. That part's gonna suck, but it'll be great.
[quietly] If you get promoted, and if you haven't fallen in love with me by then.
Oh totally.  Sorry, are we talking about the microwave still?
Oh, hey, man. [Daryl walks over to Jim, angrily and stares at Jim] Oh, you know what? Before I forget again, I talked to the guys about hiring you. They're gonna bring you in for an interview.
Yeah, that's the thing. I don't know if you can even give raises.
Hey, Dwight. As Sempai, do you think there is ever going to be a day where humans and robots can peacefully co-exist?
Well, it was nice meeting you guys. Take care.
I need you to breathe in my face right now.
Well it���s sales. So you have to be able to live in the world of rejection.
Ahhh... just have so much paperwork to do. [exhales] Wow. Done. Okay, let's do it.
Oh my god, I couldn't envy you more.
I'm sorry, did we or did we not pay for a show?
So you're asking me to defend your honor against Kelly?
Wait. What? [Pam nods her head] You knew? And you didn't say anything?
I guess he can't get any girl he wants.
[to Pam] I'm so sorry for all of this.
Why? When I look in the mirror, I don't like the face that looks back.
Hey. Wow. Just stopping by. Got another party to go to. A wife and two kids at home party.
Ah, ah, ah. Where's the 'please'? We're not animals.
[Jim goes outside, makes a snowball, and brings it back inside] Hey, Dwight. [Jim throws the snowball at Dwight and everyone laughs]
I promise you, you don���t have to do this for me.
Michael is on a mission to prove that he's creative.  Which I think is odd, because Michael actually might be the most creative person I've ever known.  Every day, Michael says and thinks things that no one has ever said or thought before.
Well, now you have a bus full of real..bilden..kin..
Why don't we head in your office to talk?
I mean, I don't even know what I'd do with all that money.
No, you what, seriously, you should have it.
Woah, there is a lot of brainpower in this room. We've got Michael and Oscar, the two smartest guys in the office, also in that order.
Why not, Dwight?  This is a movie.  I mean, this is for all of America to enjoy.
You know, I've just realized, this is Pam's and my first night away together. I use to play it over my head, and it was just a little bit different. Maybe a uh, nice hotel. Or a romantic dinner. Wine... uh but, wine that wasn't made out of beets. Didn't think Dwight would be involved at all. And uh, I always imagined less manure. I mean, some manure, just... less.
Look, I'm at the supermarket, and they only have numbered candles. How old is she?
I just didn't, you know, want a deal.
Oh, I don't know. You know, they've taken a good deal of clients, so--
Last night on Trading Spouses, there's... have you seen it?
No. I'm not a lawyer, but I don't think this is the place to do this.
Well, since I have no incentive to sell, I've cleaned my car, organized my desk, and taken a multivitamin. So... what now?
You know I majored in Public Speaking in College.
Well, I kinda feel like what we have going for us is our customer service, and no matter how we change this up, I don't know that a website's going to be able to replace that.
By the way, did we leave all the food on the bus?
What? You're in Florida? Andy, Nellie Bertram's trying to take your job.
[touches headset] Call you right back. What were you saying?
Nope. Not for you it's for your hair, and it is 9 am.
Um... are you aware that Nellie is giving out raises?
Okay, okay, it's no big deal.  So you're not a computer geek.
[on phone] You gotta do something, man. You can't just sit there.
Well, it doesn't mean I can't drink it.
Nice. [Dwight runs forklift into wall of warehouse] Whoa whoa whoa whoa! Oh!
Wow. When you put it that way, I guess it does sound pretty terrible.
Another bullets heads towards Agent Michael Scarn, but he jumps out of the plane without a parachute.
Well that's not true. Other people believe it's deeper inside...
So there was a little bit of a miscommunication here today.  It's been a little wild, uh, but I am on it.
Ok, so promise that you'll wait till we leave the parking lot before you go to the bar.
Yes. Fancy New Beesley would make that up. New apartment, new stories.
Oh man, that's fresh squeezed. And, uh are all the snacks complimentary?
Yeah sure. You want to look at it first?
Oh, is she that teacher in the white?
-I just don't know if I can do it.
Pam comes back from New York next week and everyone here has just been so excited for me. And involved. And intrusive. And weird.
Stanley's very upset that we're leaving Florida. But he would back me up.
I���m sorry, we're taking work time to move someone's personal belongings into their new apartment.
Oh, it was commercial break so I just wanted to check the scores.
I know it's not definite or whatever, but uh, do you know who's coming over here from Scranton?
[on Pam's answering machine] Hey, Pam... it's Jim. Um, I have a doctor's appointment in the city. So I probably won't be in till the late afternoon. Just thought I'd let you know. Okay, bye. [camera shows Jim sitting on a waiting coach in another Dunder Mifflin office]
Goodnight, have a good night. Thank you Angela.
Yeah. Okay, so for the 1.5% increase, pro-- everyone gets a little bit.
No. I just missed my wife.[Gives Pam a hug and a kiss]
Sounds tough. When you're a Jet, [starts snapping] you're a Jet all the way, right?
Oh, this is just something I'm taking a break with.
But there's definitely a desk open in the back.
Guys, listen.  This was anonymous, all right?  There is no way I could've given it to myself because I didn't even know who was on here.  I just gave it to the employee with the highest overall score.
Oh, and by the way, hate that you're helping her with this right now.  Totally.
Sorry it didn't work out. Hope you find what you're looking for.
[notices cleaning crew coming up to the gate] Cleaning people. Oscar. [everyone starts to walk outside] OK, so all you need to do is explain to them what happened, 'cause I think they can help us.
Uh, I think we should just drop it... 'cause obviously he doesn't want to talk about it.
Absolutely. Or you could just be nice to your customers.
It's a bold move, to Photoshop yourself into a picture with your girlfriend and her kids on a ski trip with their real father. But then again, Michael's a bold guy. [Towards unseen cameraman] Is bold the right word?
Do you think Dwight's bein' a little weird today?
Well, for starters, I've known you as a couple since the beginning of the relationship, which was approximately [looks a watch] three hours ago.
[to Pam] Oh, you know what? Sorry, forgot to tell you. I intercepted a transmission earlier and it seems that the CIA is gonna need Dwight down at their headquarters in Langley for training and an ice cream social with the other agents.
So we're gonna say the most likely scenerio is that Michael matured overnight?
You're looking at the master of leaving parties early. They key is, you have to make a strong impression, so you want to have a picture taken, you want to say some peculiar non sequitur that people remember, you want to note something unique, a talking point, for later. I don't mean to brag, but New Year's Eve, I was home by nine.
Cece���s really into princesses now. So we decided to turn them into a positive female role models.
Yes. I am the popular social networking site known as Book Face.
Did you get that? Please tell me you got that. This is all going to be on.
New leads, a new territory to look into, maybe an in with a big company that we could get our foot in the door���
Robert, thank you. Thank you for this. Thank you for all this. This night's been magical.
[presses button on headset] Hello, this is Dwight.
No, um. How is this not a pyramid scheme?
Andy, can I talk to you for a second?
Okay. But what is he more famous for?
Ever since Pam and I started dating, I just feel weird asking her to make copies for me. So, I make my own copies. And that copier sucks. Let me tell you, I-But you know what? Pam and I don't have to agree on everything.
Oh, here she is. Careful, careful, whoa. Alright, easy. Almost there.
Honestly, I don't mind. [long, awkward pause until thermos is empty] Did you want me to wash it for you or...
Why does he own a guitar if he doesn't know how to play?
What the heck is going on?! The stock prices are plummeting! Are you gonna take control of the message or do I have to send in someone who understands the media?!
Here's a 'not hypothetical'. I'm really happy I'm with Karen.
Hey, Dwight, sounds like she was 14, so maybe we wanna go a little easy.
So I caught everyone before they left and I told them my idea, and they loved it. Because this is a group that respects good ideas... the one time a year they hear one.
He's not a part of this. You know that.
I'm gonna drive you up to the lake, give you a whole week on the water. Just you, me and the kids.
College rules (Cathy throws Jim the bag and Jim kicks Dwight)
Ok, I know where you're going with this, and this is who I am now. I'm a douche. But look what I can do with my hands. [Pam laughs]
So, you got the signal from the third-base coach. You know what I'm saying? Like if there was a fly out to deep right, you know. A runner on second. He tagged up, didn't he?
What? Oh no no no. Dwight, no. I'm using her, for the alliance. Who knows the most information about this office? Pam.
I think she just didn't want a crucifix cake.
Uh, that is an invitation to an online party.
Madge from the warehouse just made her first sale. Madge. We should have been doing this a long time ago.
Colder... warmer... little warmer... there you go, ooh, warmer... warmer... warmer... warmer... warmer ... cold, cold, cold, back up... ooh, ooh, warmer, hot, red hot,  hot, very hot.
Not much, it's just for tracking Dwight so---
We called about a dozen customers, and they all said that they gave us great marks.
cause I stopped by your desk like 15 times a day.
Nellie, that reminds me. Do you want this chair in the bedroom? 'Cause to be honest, I don't think it's gonna fit through the door.
You pet the animals and they pet you back.
[goofy voice] Frank and Beans. [laughs] Always makes her laugh.
I know, but it's gonna be a little tough because there's no good place to hide there.
We'll see.  I'm sure you guys will... find you way back to one another someday.
You know I love a good guessing game, but why don't I just tell you what I'm here for?  Turns out you guys have made a pretty big dent in the Dunder Mifflin sales.
Is this a bad time to be doing this?
It is weird! Look at you, perceptive. Now I know why Jo's kept her eye on you!
Aw, thanks, Pete. That was really nice. I just want to say how happy we are that all of you are here tonight. And I want to especially thank those of you who traveled from far away to be here with us tonight... especially the Flordia cousins who, obviously, can't take a hint. [laughter] Four years ago, I was just a guy who had a crush on a girl who had a boyfriend. And I had to do the hardest thing that I've ever had to do... which was just to wait. Uh, don't get me wrong. I flirted with her. Pam, I can now admit in front of my friends and family that I do know how to make a photo copy. Didn't need your help that many times. And do you remember how long it took you to teach me how to drive a stick?
I���ll tell you what I could accept is assistant to the regional manager. That is a real job and one I���d be proud to take.
Okay, Michael, I thought we agreed to not take up people's time with meetings like these.
A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh...
I'm sorry, wait, so is the question 'How'd I get to be so awesome?' [laughs] Because, I don't have an answer for you. [laughs]
How far away did you think we were?
Which will clearly affect the day-to-day well-being of our employees.
Wow. That was Dwight. He seems upset about something.
Any time Michael asks me to do anything, I just tell him that Dwight should do it.
What are you talking about? We--we have a commission cap?
I liked you better when you were the temp.
But I think it���s big enough to buy you some time till your next great idea���.which, by the way, I can���t wait for.
Oh yeah.  Wait 'til you get to know her better though.
Charles asked me to do this rundown of all my clients.
I was just... I'm in love with you.
Karen suggested that I get a haircut for the interview tomorrow so that I could look presentable and not, as she so lovingly puts it, homeless.
Last week, I was in a drug store and I saw these glasses.  Uh, four dollars.  And it only cost me seven dollars to recreate the rest of the ensemble.  And that's a grand total of... [Jim calculates the total on his calculator-watch] eleven dollars.
I have been getting ready and then driving over here.
These are actually forks and knives from the break room.
That's the best part. That represents a pillow, or a television.
Not bad, but you are Italian so... try it more Italian.
Well, I'm gonna to talk to Angela and we're gonna see what we can do about a pie.
When Michael plays the hypothetical game, I always say yes.
Okay, everybody, I was just making a joke. I am taking it seriously, I promise.
[after Darryl eyes him drinking from a thermos] It's mine. Don't worry.
No, I'm not worried. Because this lie isn't for me, it's for Pam. And when she gets her body back and her confidence back... yes, I will tell her the truth. That I had feelings for a co-worker today that I haven't had in years. But in my defense, he was grabbing my crotch fairly aggressively at the time.
That is a great offer. Thank you. I really think I should be concentrating on sales.
[on the phone] Hey, did I tell you we were going to have a baby?  Oh, thank you very much.  I'm excited.  Oh, definitely.
That was the moment that you knew you liked me?
[to the buyer] Hold on a second. [to Pam] The last few months have meant the world to me and all I care about���
Wow! Ok. No one else should even try! Gold medals! Give him medals. Wow.
It's not.  It's different.  But it's a good book.
Prima nocta, I believe from the movie Braveheart, and confirmed on wikipedia, is when the king got to deflower every new bride on her wedding night.  So...
Can I just have the ham and cheese sandwich, thanks.
Oh bud, I know. Do you have a pacifier or anything?
That's amazing. Well, listen. You can't win 'em all, right?
So you know my job has something to do with sports, but you don't know the end of the word 'Philadelphia'?
Yes, we are still dating. And guess what? I took it slow.
Sorry. I���no, no, no, what I meant���what I meant actually was���
He's just mad that we're all having fun.
[getting out of a taxi] There you go. Thanks.
Oh, hey Stanley. Uh, I was just doing an impression.
You know, it's weird.  It's practically a shot for shot remake.
Uh, well, it took me a while, but I finally realized that I can���t give 100% to two things at once you know.
For now, I'm just gonna go back to work here...
That's it. I want to talk to this guy. Put me in his ear.
Then let's just not do this. Do you have any idea the risks involved?
Well, you do know that Jo was right to take the job away from you, right? There's no debating that. But, I will say... in your one week, every single one of the orders went out on time. And I think that is shagadelic, baby. [Dwight sees Creed claiming the desk in the manager's office]
Pam is staying late tonight to uh, achieve her dreams. So I'm pretty proud of her, unfortunately she was my ride home.
I didn't tell anyone! Who did you tell?
Dwight, I uh, I have something to confess.
But you didn't believe any of this was true five minutes ago.
Okay, so you made a list, you checked it twice, and now you're gonna find out who's--
He plays guitar, he likes naval history. He's a bowler.
Nope. I mean, I could have brought a change of clothes, or-
I think you just gotta ride this one out, man.
The weird part about this whole deal this that Michael truly believes that these awards are inspiring and motivational. I mean, he puts more effort and time and commitment into the Dundies than anything else he does all year. Which is probably why this branch will be downsized.
I don���t know. He wasn���t talking to me. But if I were you I wouldn���t hire his wife.
Yeah, I am.  Wait, how do you know that?  I didn't tell you that.
No more than a week.  Maybe two weeks.
Oh, sorry. It was just -- it was right here.
Well, now we won't get lost. Or we could drive. And that takes one minute.
David, I know that I'm very new at this, but I have a very good perspective on how things work.
Having a baby is as exhausting as they say it is. Having two babies [holds up index cards] - that's just unfair.
Sure. Mr. Davis, let me call you right back. Yeah, something just came up. Two minutes. Thank you very much. Dwight, what are you doing?
Listen, thank you so much for putting that all together. That was the perfect last Christmas party. All right, wish me luck.
We are doing a haunted house this Halloween. Which is actually kinda spooky because, as legend has it, on this very site there used to be a productive paper company.
Quick announcement everybody, if I could have everybody's attention.  We do have wine in the kitchen, and, uh, there is beer available on the porch and despite what you might think, it's not all for Meredith and Kelly, so please enjoy.
But that would make more sense. [Pam sighs]
OH, that's great. I'm really happy for [starts to walk away]
Thanks, Katy. Um, didn't really prepare anything to say. We're all caught pretty unprepared with this whirlwind courtship. I guess I just wanna say that Pam is the greatest. My best friend. And she's awesome. And...
Sure I'm a little nervous, but doing our work will make us feel better.  I only slack off when things are good.
No. I can't. It was like, hours ago.
Um, you don't, I don't think, come all the way back, you know.  Especially working together.
Michael Scarn takes out a nine-millimeter gun and shoots the-
Whassup! I still love that after seven years.
Well we all want a good party, right?
Oh well, 'Yoy' should bring in 'Long Tim' in one day. Shouldn't he?
All in favor of the baskets full of chocolates, teddy bears, and balloons? [all but Dwight raise their hands]
Okay, it sounds sketchy, but it helps us get more money.
Michael, on Thursday I'm going to drive down and interview with David for the open position in New York.
Thanks guys. All right, here we go. Let's go.
Um, I was laying on the ground, defenseless, and uh, he just kept throwing 'em until he exhausted himself. And, uh, [cell phone chimes] then... [reading text message] 'How 'bout icing it? lol. Dwight.'
[motions he is on the phone] Can I call you right back? Thank you very much. [comes over] Okay. [sees notebook with two lists of staff names] What is this?
What? He never called you? I thought you said it just fizzled.
No, it's because you also have a lot of weaknesses, Michael!
Mose has been weird? That���s so unlike him.
When you work hard, you play hard around here.  Even if you don't work hard. Oh, here's something. Uh, why didn't you ever call Pam back?
[sneezes on Dwight, looks at camera] You're welcome.
Just then, Agent Chang gets a bullet in the head.
Hey, uh, does Mr. Nortman still teach here? He's a jerk, right?
[under breath] Oh, no, not while I'm here.
Excuse me. How long is the wait for a table for two?
I'm going to take a trip. I'm going to get out of town for a while... and go someplace... not here.
So this year, for the first time ever, I got Pam in Secret Santa. And I got her this teapot, which I know she really wants, so she can make tea at her desk. But I'm also going to stuff it with some inside jokes. Like, this is my high school yearbook photo. She saw it at the party, and it really makes her laugh. Not sure why. What else .. ooh. This is a hot sauce packet. She put this on a hot dog a couple years ago because she thought it was ketchup. And it was really funny, so I kept the other two. [holds up a miniature pencil] This would take a little too long to explain, so I won't. And this is the card. Because Christmas is the time to tell people how you feel.
That's okay. [Hannah shows pic of husband naked with baby] Oh, no, it's not. I'm sorry, is that your husband in the tub with him?
I know Dwight misses Kevin. I saw him make his portrait out of a Wooly Willy. Tomorrow���s his wedding day. You can���t be anything but happy on your wedding day.
So tell me again why I can't be part of your club?
Oh wow.  So that���s two miles if you incorporate the walk back.
[Meredith's hair is on fire] Oh, oh, oh, oh!
Gotta write that down. Ok, big day today. Airing of the documentary. Who���s excited?
What are you doing? Last time I saw you, you were whipping me out of the building.
Listen, Wallace said these were just rumors, right? So we have no reason to think the company is anything but fine.  So if we just go on with our work, you and me, they'll follow along.
Oh, come on. Not even Roy will have hot dogs at his wedding.
Can you... [seems intimidated, clears throat] You are a man of great confidence. Could you speak a little more to that, and, what the role of confidence... would be... in a dialogue with a subordinate?
You���re gonna want to invest in a lot more liability insurance, but, uh���
[wearing a tuxedo] I don't know. Is it classy enough?
I would love to hear the other mottos.
[sighs] Oh, so Dwight gave me this wooden mallard as a gift, and I found a recording device in it. Yes. So, I think if I played it just right I can get Dwight to play out the plot of National Treasure.
Yeah. You know what? I���ll meet you down there. Just gotta make a quick call.
Oh, I just mean if you, if you didn't lock the door, then we could be upstairs where it's warmer.
Ah...[sees Dwight's wallet and open email] I'm gonna s- [see's Dwight watching from break room]
Thanks Dennis, I appreciate it. [To Pam] Hey! How are you?
[Pam starts sipping an empty glass] I think those might be empty.
Dinner and a show, if you include Michael's movie. [Pam nods reluctantly]  And there was dancing and fireworks.  Pretty good date.
And listen if anything else happens, just...roll with it.
Wha- no. No, it was not a poisoning.
Yeah, trust me, that would be fun for no one.
[addressing camera after opening envelope on his desk] Thank you.
So. We got Kev some stuff. Um... a party pack of M&M's, his favorite candy. A DVD of American Pie 2, which is his favorite movie, and, he lent it to Creed, so, I can guarantee you he won't get that back.
Hey... you know what, Dwight? Maybe we should get our photo I.D. taken together.
All right!  [sitting down behind Michael's desk] I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be doing, but...
Yeah, absolutely.  Do people like sitting next to you? You���re clean, right?
I was thinking more like Europe. Or something like that. But, good second choice.
Yeah. Gotcha. Of course. I'm gonna dive in. To the rundown. I'll be exhausted 'cause it's like a triathlon. [At door.] Do you want to close this? Close, or keep it?
I don't know. Is it what you expected?
Three, two, one! [pulls sheet to reveal Christmas tree]
OK, I want a copy on my desk by the end of the day or you will receive a full disadulation.
Whoa, no, no. That's overdoing it, I think.
Oh, Pam? Can I see you in here for a second? It's important, so...
The great speakers throughout history were not joke tellers. They were people of passion. So if you want to do well today, you got to do what they did.
[naked from chest up] Oh, I'm sorry, is this a working office, and not a French beach?
So some of the co-workers were thinking of going out tonight, but I told them-
I am a diapering master.  I have done little else in the past two months.  There is nothing I cannot diaper.  Go ahead.  Try to think of something.  I dare you.
So, I guess I'll see you in [looks at watch] ten hours.
[on phone] Hey, Dan, this is Jim, and it is about 11:15, and I wanted to know what you were up to tomorrow, which is the fifteenth, and that is a...
Yes. This is going to be very interesting. All right, I'm out of here. See you later?
Hey. She had a nice time. It seems rude.
I just feel like after fifteen years at this company, bravo by the way, that we should celebrate with a very classy event, a night to remember.
Yeah, definitely didn't need help with that, but, yeah.
[laughs] Yes! Five bucks each. And it was totally worth it.
Oh, um...[mimicking Stanley] Why do you keep CC'ing me on things that have nothing to do with me?  [Pam and Oscar laugh, Stanley walks in, and Oscar leaves quickly]
Pete couldn't make the Mets. She's at Pratt. You played JV baseball. Will you lighten up a little bit?
[on phone] Absolutely.  I couldn't be more sorry about this.
We should take a look at those surveys.
Come on man, just give it a couple days.  I think you'll be all right.
Yeah, well, three dollars a mile. It's gonna end up being like 50 bucks. So... God, I can't even calculate what you're gonna have to give.
I don't know what else we can do here.
Andy, you gotta check this out. He just showed me���[gets interrupted by Andy].
[on phone]: Man, I wish I was there to see his face when he gets to the end ...
Darryl! We all know you. Your interview is not nearly as important as the other guys. [Darryl taps a couple times on Jim's desk and walks away]
Does the Department of Health know about this?
Oh, that's so rude of me. Have you seen, um, Pam's new art? It's right there. Check it out. [closes door]
[to Karen] Woah, stop, another hole. Take a big step. [Karen steps into lake] Yes!
OK. And they're all dangerously close to not getting pie. And there's only one guy who can save them. It's not me.
Wow, that's... really thoughtful of you, Dwight, thank you.
[to Cici] Can you clap! Can you clap for mom?
No kidding. And I am just going to lie down in the back, if that's all right.
Which we realize sounds crass, but, it... is his favorite number.
We, uh, we haven't talked about. But I think that she's���I think she understands... what this is.
Michael, I'm just terrible at all this stuff, so that's really cool.
Anyway, now we are going bargain hunting in the haunted graveyard of their love.
[on the phone] We have that going out Tuesday... Okay? Sure, no, I can... I'll double-check that for you.
Well, why did you do that? You work here, don't you want good insurance?
Your mom would love that. She would. Oh, this band is called Scrantonicity.
Ok, so that's a disaster. Luckily have a two-part plan. One, run. Two, hide. It's pretty smart, right? [walks into Vance Refrigeration office] Hi, how you doing? I'm Jim Halpert from across the hall. We are redoing our supply closet and I was wondering if I could take a look at yours for some ideas.
Oh, no. Don't worry about it. I was just gonna put a couple keys on it every day until Christmas. Then his pants would have fallen down, which was a little gift to me, but...
Sorry, quick thing. Is it true that if you can't get out, you don't want anyone to help you?
I have a lot of work to do this afternoon.  Those mines aren't gonna sweep themselves.
Don���t get me wrong, I am definitely here for Pam. But this is an awesome added bonus.
I think they're going to the conference finals.
How many times have I asked you to put me up for a branch manager job.
[walking to his car] Hey, it's me.  It is 5:03.
Pam always says I look like Nixon. That's crazy, right? I mean there's nothing there. True���[touches his nose] Oh no.
Oh, I understand. And I also have lots of questions, like, what does a demerit mean?
Well, we all handle it differently. I personally choose to handle it like a normal person, but...
Yeah sorry everyone else didn���t come.  I think they���re just tired.  With holes in their shoes.  And they have dysentery.
I love Star Wars as much as the next guy���
[A note is on Jim's computer that says, 'It is time. Parking lot at noon.' Jim nods and hands it to Dwight who burns it.]
Uh, this Wallace guy is lookin' at hard time. And we only know this because of what Dwight Snoot said on record!
You could���ve just called that an alliance too, right?
You've gotta stop with the hot chocolate stuff. I was thinking we can jam his drawers, so they only comes out two inches, then he can see everything in them but he can't get to them.
I think I���m a little too busy these days to s--- [whispering] Oh ,my God. I did send Dwight on a quest for the Holy Grail.
Wait, so are you... you like heart-shaped jewelry, though, right?
So what did he say? Was it my fault?
No, I shouldn't have to ask you to do stuff like that. You should just do it.
Well I���ve been trying to tell you how I feel, and you wouldn���t believe me, so [shows her DVD] I needed a little help.
Alright... well, I'm not asking for a raise. I'm gonna actually be asking for a pay decrease.
So, that's still going on, huh? You and Kelly?
Concussion. [Michael scribbles something out] What did you write?
You have to fire the salesman that treated me so terribly.
Quick question--Do you just decide who gets what in the moment, or did you make a list?
Yeah, they don't ever talk about careers that were made because of unplanned pregnancies.
Hey man. I am so sorry about that.
Mmmhmm.  Why don't you start by telling me what you got.
Yes!  I think we should look into that.  If you could just speak up louder...
No, no, no, it's not your turn. All right, thirteen is the new number. Oscar, go ahead.
Hey! There she is. [Pam laughs] How you doin?
Hey, Toby. Um, I wanted to ask you a question.
So, Andy, what improvements would you make as office manager?
I really wish I could help. I'm not really sure how I can...
Am I the only one who remembers what he did when he was in charge? I feel like I'm going a little bit crazy.
Hey. So they accidentally gave us an extra egg sandwich this morning. Who wants it?
How dare you? My family built this country, by the way.
So, Dwight thinks that tonight is a surprise party for Michael.
So I guess I can assume that was personal.
It���s just a list of our names, split into two columns.
Really wish you would have told me the new boss was coming today.
[hits ball, ricochets to groin] Ah! Classic, right? [Jim continues to rally poorly and falls down]
The real reason that I went to Stamford... was because... I wanted to be... not here.
[Jim and Pam approaching the wedding venue] Is this his house?
Visitor center. Gonna grab a map for the memorials, right?
You can't say, or you can't pronounce it?
Hey, Phyllis, Do you have any games that you play in the office?
[taking away Dwight���s handset] Go ahead David, I���m listening.
[Dwight imitates the 'Jim face'] Look at that.
Eh, she's nice, I guess.  You know what?  Best thing to do, Pros and Cons list.
Yeah, you haven't seen that since 1983. That is amazing. Okay, we have to sign him. I'm gonna call the label, we're gonna...
I think that's probably all we need to hear from...
She pays me back every day just by being my wife so that���s fine.
Well, that kind of sucks, because it had all the photos of my brother's new baby on it, so...
Alright, let's get this started.  I'm gonna be reading the action descriptions, and Phyllis, I would like you to play Catherine Zeta Jones.
Alright now, I'm gonna warn you. Don't freak out, okay?
Why don't you run the meeting? You play with dolls.
Okay, easy. Trust me, I'm around for the long-haul.
[Dwight and Jim are playing ping-pong, and Dwight scores] What the hell?
Wow! It's my favorite part of Christmas. The authority.
I think that you are able to take constructive criticism very well.
So the deal was, Dwight doesn't blow anything up, and I wear a costume.  And a moustache.
No way. How do you confuse 28 Days with 28 Days Later?
Phyllis by a nose. Gold medal in Flernenton.
Nope, nope, nope, nope.  Come on, let's go to the hospital.  Pam, let's go to the hospital right now.
Thank you. You know what, screw this! [pulls Pam into a big smooch]
[scoffs] I... will never say a word.  And now, we are even.
I'm going home, and I'm taking my baby with me.
What do you think? Tomorrow? Lunch, you and me?
Are you sure you once knew how to do this?
Alright, here we go!  You're doing great!  She'll be here soon.
Well, I don't think I'll be here in ten years.
Oh my God, are you alright?  Erin, will you call 911 please?
I'm sorry, are you advocating that I use it less?
Okay, bye. [Jim turns back to Julius] So sorry about that.
[not thinking clearly because of Pam's note] What's that? Oh, uh, great.  You know?  I just um, I really appreciate the buildings, and uh, the people, and um, there's just a [sic] energy... New York has, uh...  Not to mention, they have places that are open past eight.  [David laughs] So that's a... bonus.
You're not going to do anything to his neck or his groin.
Alright, let me just say good-bye to Pam.
Well, you seem to have this under control.
Guys, what is going on?!  [Pete and Tom burst out in laughter]
I'll just leave that suit in your office then.
Hey, I have a question. Who do you think is really the best salesman in this office?
What are we working with, peppermint or wintergreen?
And I didn't tell anyone because I'm not really sure how I feel about it.
Okay. Just want to let you know I take complaints very seriously. So... When did this happen?
Trust me, this is the least of all evils. It took me all day to pull this off, so you should be thrilled, considering.
Sorry, I forgot Kevin's extension. It's a fantasy football thing.
There's gotta be a better way to do this. This is literally how they built the pyramids.
You're not getting an interview, Dwight. The whole point of this Search Committee process is to prevent hiring someone like you ever again.
[on phone] Well, I really appreciate the offer, but I'm just happy the way things are. Okay. Thank you. [to Pam] That was Jo, asking me if I wanted to take over as acting manager while they find a replacement. I told her... I don't want to mess this up, right? There's a consensus, people are happy.
Really?  Looks like I hired the right guy.  I'm glad.  Any real potential there Beesley?
I'm sorry, are you saying that Meredith was drunk at 9 AM?
OK. Uh, Karen, any news from that law firm?
I have one, too. Jim. Jim, Is Jim. My name is Jim.
Um, why did she slap Martin Luther King?
Uh, can you get this rundown for me?' [impersonating Charles]
I bought this teapot for Pam, and I know she really wants it. So, can I trade you for it?
How long is this? [flips through pages]  Oh, Pam. Good work! Oop, wait, stop.  Drawings.
Man, you can really hold your liquor, Billabelli.
I have this conference call today with this company in Philly that I���m helping start. Ah, first board meeting. Also, the first time I���ve ever been excited about work. So, that feels... wrong.
Well the cats out of the bag. I used to have a crush on Pam and now I [hesitate] don't. Riveting.
I did. From you. You gotta stop telling people.
I'm Jim. [Jim hi-fives Abby] Annnnd... let's sell some paper.
How about this? How about we just ask Robert? Can we all agree that maybe the C.E.O should decide this?
That's impossible. [Dwight climbs through ceiling hatch] Dwight!
This is really not how this is supposed to happen.
If anyone can do this, you can do this.
Katy but you know what, don't try to sell me one. Okay, seriously 'cause I'm just here to learn.
I don't want to be biased, but I am very close to Ryan.  You know that.
And when it happens, it's going to kick your ass, Beesly. So... stay sharp.
Stupid.  Everyone knows to ask for a hundred more wishes. [Pam laughs] Dumb.
What are you talking about? You're the one terrorizing me.
Not really a question. [starts to laugh] Okay, let's get you home, you're drunk.
I've been driving stick since high school. So... yes. For a really long time that's all I had. I just had little moments with a girl who saw me as friend. And a lot of people told me I was crazy to wait this long for a date with a girl who I worked with, but I think even then I knew that... I was waiting for my wife. So...  I would like to propose a toast. So if you'd all raise your glasses. Not Pam, for obvious reasons, but everyone else. If you would raise your glasses--
Hey. So, Wade wants to send people to the Sloan conference. We gotta compile a list of our target clients.
Okay, you know what?  You don't need to be updating me as much as you're updating me.
I guess. [Pam smiles and walks away, then comes back and kisses Jim on the cheek] How dare you.
[points at paper on desk] What does 2005 season mean?
Oh, tomorrow, that's gonna be tough 'cause I already laid out my outfit, so...
I can't believe this place is real. I mean, I've heard about his beet farm for years, but wow.
Dwight says that he actually doesn't know one single fact about bear attacks.
We're best friends, actually. We're going wine-tasting next weekend, if you want to come.
Bye. ��[pause] Yep. See, you���ve still got to press ���End,��� Pam.
No- Ok. Well, we'll talk about it later. Straussburg! I had a meeting in Straussburg and I dropped you off beforehand. I was wearing a tan shirt with stripes?
I have an assistant now, who can help you with whatever you need. He is lazy, so crack the whip.
Wow, that's- that's a little rude. What's your deal?
If you were a real star you would put your face in it.
Then you did nothing wrong. We should go.
Uh, it's saying the server went down? Does Anybody know that password? 'Cause otherwise we can't do any work.
Michael, can I... OK, I'm just going to skip right past the what and go with why.
But, you know what? I came up with something and I think it's really gonna help.
I'm not gonna go tell Phyllis that she can't be Santa.
Ok, well, that still leaves a 30% chance that I will attack you from the front.
Pam, I���m not explaining this to you-- Pam, I���m not going over this again.
Uh, so, Cece had a little bit of a fever. And your mom also locked her in the car.
Okay, I am not dying here.  Come on. [everyone is coughing from the smoke, Dwight lights some fire crackers and they start popping]
Robert, just wanted to grab you one second. This place is amazing, by the way.
I think today was a good day to have two managers.  'Cause if you're a family stuck on a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean, one parent might want to just keep rowing.  But if the other parent wants to play a game, it's not because they're crazy.  It's because they're doing it for the kids.  And I get that now.
Ok, he has to be stopped. Please, please, please, please, just ask Michael.
So maybe you're not completely ethical after all.
Pam, meet Harvey. This is Michael's new friend.
What? Yes, that is exactly what I mean. Wow. You are very good at what you do.
I mean, it's just that- [clears throat] You know, Pam and I are still dating, so, and, I just mean that things are going really well, so I didn't want to see... you...
Last week, I finally told Pam about the other job I took in Philly...the side job. And she was so incredibly cool about it. And now I just wanna do something huge for her. Like if we were in some biker bar and she mouthed off to some bikers and they came lumbering over and I was like wham! [mimes punch] Gotta go through me first.
fool me, fool me, go on and fool me. Love me,
Let me guess, you think you should get it.
I am meeting Dr. J today, otherwise known as Julius Irving, famed 76er and my own personal hero. But i have to be careful not to rub it in Pam's face because let's be honest, how would I feel if I was at home stuck with the kids while she was go carting with John Stamos.
I feel like there's a chance for me to start over. And if I fall back into the same kind of things I used to do., then ... what am I doing?
So Dwight did take the bait. He used my credit card numbers to send a two hundred dollar bouquet of flowers, to my wife...from me.
Let's be honest, it's not totally my fault. [indicates Pam]  Shared responsibility.
[to Dwight] All right. So... I guess this is it.
What, what are you going to do? Bring it, Beesley. Bring it. Oh yeah, good move. Not such an ultimate fighter now.
Well, I think you handled it pretty well.
I promise you, we don���t need a warning-
No, no, no, no. Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Let's talk about this.
How much time do you have left on your break?
[to Jordan] Don't worry, the first day's always the hardest.
Right, cause that's what we are talking about.
No, no. I want to hear you tell it.
Okay. All right, come on. [picks up Cece from Pam, whispers to her] Where are we going? Where are we going? We're gonna take a little field trip.
Oh! Um... tonight, actually? No. I'm uh just still getting settled.
And when the Indian Ocean calms, one speck of white remains in waters cold and Kelly green.'
Today.  Now, maybe.  'Cause we have a hoop downstairs and a real ball, so you don't have to mime it.
Is this you? Are you being you, or is this Creed? Are you...
No. No, no. Just um... some personal stuff. And I'm not really ready to revist that, I don't think.
You know, babe, I should have told you but... I did something bad.
Phyllis says the same twelve clich��s every time it rains. So, I promised everyone that if she says them all by noon today, I will send out for hot chocolates.
I think they run through these panels and then down under the map. I wouldn't know for sure cause I don't have a trained ear. That's why I have to use one of these. [pulls out stethoscope]
[pulls away beans] I'm really sorry. Pam must have put those out.
Okay. Just trying to get some advice on my trip.
Ah, dinner.  Let's see, maybe we should try the new Italian place, where the drive-in used to be.
Yeah, just keep your eye on Dwight, great.
I thought you said you were inventing diseases? That's spontaneous dental hydroplosion.
Tony the tiger.  You don't hear that much any more.
Well, I for one, was amazed at how qualified everyone was. You?
So I was wondering if Karen and I could get off a few hours early 'cause we want to spend the night in the city.
I have no idea.  We went right for the copier.
Mike Tibbets is like the most boring-looking guy I know. So if that was for the matchmaker test, I think I'm in the clear. If that wasn't for the matchmaker test, then... Cathy, he's a really nice guy.
I think this was also the year he renounced Earth Day and vowed to the destroy the planet he once loved.
No, no, no, no. Yes. We saw this, yes. No, it wasn't like a look around. We really just had a peek. Quick peek. Didn't focus on anything in particular.
Absolutely not. It's just that sometimes... goodbyes are a bitch.
The guys at Athlead are still bugging me about this three month roadshow thing. Meeting athletes on their home turf, building relationships. Yeah, it sounds exciting. But I said no, and that���s final. I almost lost Pam over this business. I���m not risking that again.
No, it- [high-pitched feedback as Jim starts to leave, feedback changes as he moves, turns over the mallard to see the listening devics, sighs, places mallard back on the desk]
Uh, you guys are going to love these. So, empanadas on me. You guys gotta try them.
And I took it right back. It was like...
Hi, yeah, can I talk to one of your travel agents?
[picks a card] It's the four of hearts.
And seriously, it's totally not a big deal, ok? And when I found out you were engaged, I mean.
Okay. I���m really sorry I told the guys I���d be there for the board meeting.
I was thinking... fireworks for the party. What do you think?
Oh, yeah. You sold a lot, so it's lighter.
Okay, I do. There like mini briefcases, alright?  Lots of guys have them.
Try this. [takes Dwight's 'Asian' race and switches it with the one he wrote]
[gets up to leave room, Michael gestures for him to stay]
And, also, any forms that you are going to need...
So you thought they meant your reason for coming to the hospital.
Um, I had asked Michael if I could head up the Oscar investigation and he said that only Dwight was capable of handling such sensitive material.
Yeah. Big sale. Don���t worry about it though, I don���t really care about the points.  I would like a point receipt though���[on phone] Hey! Yes, this is Jim Halpert calling for Donald���can you hold on for one second? Thank you very much. [gets up to give Erin his point receipt]
You're right, we didn't dance.  It was more like, swaying.  But still romantic.
Once a quarter, the sales staff at this branch has to stay late to do order form consolidation... which, amazingly, is even less interesting than it sounds.
Ah, and did Robert California get an invite to your party?
[Jim and Gabe laugh, Toby smiles and nods] Oh.
Would You Rather. Would You Rather is our third game.
Huh. How long would it take me if I drove 300 miles an hour?
Well, you know what Dwight? He's your work boss, okay? He is not your relationship boss.
I think you should do it. That's great!
Dwight and I used to go on sales calls all the time. In fact, I have a picture to remember that time. Oh young Jim. There is just so much I need to warn you about. And yet, tragically, I cannot.
Yeah. I just don't think this is the kind of task, that I... am going to do. You know who would be great for this?
Hey, um, I think I am gonna take that job. And Scranton... it's not that bad. So, if they offer you a job there, I think you should take it.
Hey dude, you know what a 'rundown' is?
This... is the future, because... This is the past. I���ve been through a lot of issues in my life. I���ve seen drug addiction -- unemployment. I���ve been in a relationship that tore my heart apart, without ever being able to accept that love drove the pain. [scattered applause]
I was in Jamaica, and I got lost, and it was getting dark this one night and then out of nowhere with a cart and he's selling these. Dwight he's telling me things about myself that there's no way he could have known.
And his brother, Walt Jr., locked himself in the wine cellar.
Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Um��� I don���t know how to tell you this, but��� we have a little bit of a problem.
Maybe, but... we're gonna need somebody to create a diversion, and...
[confused] What? [Darryl points at his thermos Jim has been using] Oh, man! I'm sorry about that.
You know it's a tough thing, seeing a grown man take six shots to get out of a sand trap but, I had to give Phil credit for not quitting. Which is what I told him. I also told him I don't quit either, and I'd call him every single day until he gave me his business. Which he then did, after ...fifteen minutes of me blocking his car. So I am now his paper supplier! And I shot a 102 today, so I'm feeling pretty good.
You know what? I could use a little help.
So by that rationale, if I had to sneeze, I should just sneeze on you.
I hope you're not killing yourself on this, because I'm sure it's good enough for Michael's ad that will probably be seen by no one.
It's always more fun to mess with Dwight with an audience. That was usually Pam so now that she's out I had to find someone else. Turns out that Stanley is quite the comedy fan. But not everything makes him laugh. He has very specific tastes. Through a painstaking process of trial and error, I've found out what he likes. And it's really weird.
No, you're not reopening the case.  The case is closed.
[Pam is making copies and is struggling with the machine] You might want to consider changing teams, because we would-we would love to have you.
Pam and I are great. She just recently finished her mural for the Irish cultural center.
Why would you say that? I meant 4 apple, 4 blueberry, 2 cherry, 1 peach and 1 chocolate. I thought that was implied.
That's interesting. Wow, it's a little early for ice cream, don't you think?
Does it save time though? ���Cause we���ve been here for about an hour.
Okay, you know what?  I'm going to go give, uh, doctor Asmani a quick call.  He'd probably know...
[as Dwight tries to take paper out from under him] Hey, can you not?
Okay, you know what?  I am going to be, uh, setting the agenda here. Okay? Can everybody gather up, please? Important announcement. Very important announcement. I think this is a perfect opportunity for all of us to participate in some really intense, psychologically revealing conversations. So we're going to be playing Desert Island, umm, Who Would You Do?
This... is Parkour. [turns laptop to camera, shows Parkour instructional video] Internet sensation of 2004. And it was in one of the Bond films. It's pretty impressive. [Michael is shown climbing/walking on various objects in office] The goal is to get from point A to point B as creatively as possible, so technically they are doing Parkour, as long as point A is delusion and point B is the hospital.
This is awkward to talk about, but there may or may not be--but definitely is--a mutiny  forming in the warehouse right now.
Uh, no one really knows, but Pam's parents are going through a little bit of a rough patch in their marriage.
Oh my God. [Michael bangs the table] Oh my God.
You're not in it at all, because you can't be employee of the month, you're a manager.
What if we just bring it up? We just put it out in the open?
God bless you, Recyclops. And your cold robot heart. [Dwight throws an aluminum can towards the recycling bin and misses]
Oh you had said that you don't do anything personal during work time so... I'm just making sure.
Keeping it simple -that's what I'm doing. But I am working hard on this one. Real hard.
So, I guess Pam and Dwight are friends now.
Okay, I'll try. [The coat rack wobbles] [Pam holds up an umbrella handle to the camera in another scene]
[talking on phone] You sound tired. Everything ok?
[Michael in his office playing music loudly, Jim walks in and turns the volume down, Michael trailing off on singing]  We have to do something because people are losing it out there wondering what's going to happen.
Okay. Let's start with the 'I love you' level.
So we're still on for lunch? You're meeting me here? Okay. Great. Bye.
Because you said 'do you wanna hang out'-
A good assistant knows what their superior is thinking before they even think it. Meredith, what number am I thinking of right now?
Oh, 'cause I don't want my feet to get burned.
I am just as much of a boss as Michael and I can do anything that Michael can do. Alright?  Who here believes that I have as much power as Michael? [Pam, after a moment,  is the only one who raises her hand]
Yeah, well, with you it's different, okay? Cause I just- I just suck. I just- I suck!
I think you're good.  Doing a good job.
Quick question: uh, why is Tom Hanks on the wall?
But! That girl must've had monstrous hands because the holes fit.
I did get called in to jury duty. And they released me around noon, so, didn't think it was worth it to come back to work for a half day. And then the next morning Pam was a little overwhelmed with the kids so I took an extra day to help out. And then three other days happened.
I wasn't. But thank you. [to Pam] Do you know anything about this party?
I���m taking some time off from work���well, my other work���because we needed it.
You know what?  Maybe it's in the ceiling.
Last week, Dwight sent out a memo about the dress code. So, this is me showing him that I'm taking it very seriously.
Clark ended the whole thing with a karate demonstration. Did you know there was a belt above black?
Pam's with Roy. I'm with Karen. And, uh, Brangelina is with Frangelina. Movin' on.
She looks at it when she���s on the potty, and she makes the faces.
Last week, my company in Philly lost a big investor, so we���re scrambling to find new funding. Luckily, my partners have a fix ��� me asking the boss of the company I���m abandoning to give us a gigantic influx of cash.  So��� problem solved. Thanks, guys.
Oh! That was really. [Dwight hits purse against table] This is necessary to do to really give it a good workout. This is the ooooh... This is the prettiest one of all.
Why don't I wanna go? Didn't expect to need a reason, so let me think here. Um. I don't know any of these people. It's an obligation. I don't like talking paper in my free time, or in my work time. And, did I use the word pointless?
That's... great. You know, to tell the truth, I used to have a big thing for Pam, so...
I���m really sorry. Is there anything I can do, maybe pretend to be Chuck?
All right, I know, I know. Let's just get this.
Wait, wait, wait. Pam. No. Do you understand? The... the game is Desert Island Movies, not guilty pleasure movies. Desert Island Movies are the movies you're going to watch for the rest of your life! Forever! Unforgivable.
Uh, I will have the chicken piccata with a side salad.
Okay. Yesterday, we had a meeting about planets.
And then you go to school for three years.
Well we are here now, so let's just--
I'd hang on to it though, cause I can think of a bunch. Like a 70's theme party, or a 70's theme meeting, or a 70's theme convention...
Guys, I think that seems a little unfair. I mean, I feel like we don't definitely know it was Andy.
Andy put down a bunch of deposits on stuff for his wedding with Angela, but then she was sleeping with Dwight for... several years. Wait, no, that can't be right.
Oh, no, that's not this 'cause that's in��� March. Uh, this is just the NBA. Professional. Miami Heat, actually, so��� [sits on floor]
[hushed voice] Uh yeah. Trust me, I���d rather be with you guys.
Like, a few years down the road, Cece says, 'Mom, there's a ghost in my closet.' Now, you say one of two things - one, 'You're just having a bad dream,' or two, 'Let's go see what it was.'
Oh no thanks, I think Karen and I will take my car.
Oh, okay. [kisses Pam] Don't worry about it.
Hey. It is my business when it happens at work.
So let's just say that Dwight has come at you with the throat punch.  Now how would you, Dwight, defend against it?
Yeah, I'd say she's happy. I mean, she loves her classes. Loves the city. I mean, last night, she was out with her friends, till, like, 8:00 AM.
Okay, I'm sorry, why are we discounting this whole 'Woody came to life' thing so quickly?
Wait a second. You know you can't buy that now, right? And I can come back and get it for you later. But I'm saying right now, we can't do that.
OK, great, listen to me. Listen to me. [Dwight makes funny gesture] No, no, I know. Will you just let me tell you one thing, please?
These are the Closing Ceremonies. Step up. You're on the top one.  [Michael stands on podium] Congratulations to Michael, because he closed on his condo. So, gold medal. [everyone claps]
I knew it. You designed a uniform for Dunder Mifflin.
...well I'm going to call corporate to make sure that they know I didn't lose half my sales.
I don't get it. He's not even my boss anymore.
Do you want to watch the game with us? We're watching a game. The Heat game. Just a game.
The... the... the... what I was saying is the real genius was...[car alarm blaring] was in the...
Great, it's gonna cost a couple a hundred buck and ah... oh actually more with tips.
I knew it. Oh man, just like that huh?
Wait, wait, wait. That's actually a really good idea Kelly.
I love you.  Okay, I gotta--I gotta go!
I was going to use today to purge my inbox, but now something much more pressing has come up.
Uh no it's W R K, as in kitten.  Oh my boss is singing Closing Time, maybe that's what you are hearing.
Quick phone call from you guys, keep going,
Ohh, man, I would love to! I can't tonight, but can I come over some other time? [Abby nods]
Right after you do one thing for me. I need you to breathe in my face.
Love you too. [hangs up phone, Pam sits on a bench crying]
Okay, Dwight, you know what? You'd be getting the raise so--
Imagine going back and watching a tape of your life. You could see yourself change and make mistakes���and grow up. You could watch yourself fall in love, watch yourself become a husband, become a father. You guys gave that to me. And that���s���an amazing gift.
What if we went all the way up to five hundred points?
[on phone] Uh, yeah. I just got my replacement credit card...you want the number? Oh it's uh four seven nine three, zero zero three two, three three one three. The security code is nine two seven. OK great. Thank you very much. Bye.
I was thinkin' about more like a CD, or... a CD.
And whoever comes up with the best idea gets a $50 gift certificate to the restaurant of his or her choice.  [everyone claps and makes comments]
And I found out that there's a bus at 5:00 a.m.
My job is to speak to clients on the phone about... uh, quantities and type of copier paper. You know, whether we can supply it to them. Whether they can pay for it. And... I'm boring myself just talking about this.
I'm not really sure what movie you're talking about. Are you sure you got the title right?
I really think we should join forces on this one.
And the other is something inappropriate. Or horrible. Or both. What else? He only sings the high harmony to 'Happy Birthday.' And he's a very big believer in surprise parties. Maybe even, arguably, possibly to a fault.
[hands Pam Andy's phone] Are there any messages?
That's not gonna make your pizza eating experience any better. Trust me.
Wow! That sounds incredible. [checking cell phone]. Oh, guys. Limo���s here. Let���s do this. Change if you need to.
Here, you know what? You can have some nickels.
No one will believe this back home, but that's okay. Let me show you how it's done.
Wow. What a terrible day to not be able to talk.  Dwight was literally carrying around his own urine and dressed like one of the Village People. Why does he do the things that he does for Michael?  I just don't get it. What is he getting out of that relationship?
Mmhmm. No, but what I'm saying is, like, do you ever wonder what it was?
Wait. You did say we could pool our points, right? In that case���let���s get to work.
Yeah, but, Michael, the point is that we all bought gifts for specific people.
I really don't know how it happened, David.
Is a mop the most efficient tool to use on a carpet?
I didn't say anything.  I was waiting to see what happened.
Dwight really wants my bonus. He's trying to entrap me. Oh god, now I can't drink at this thing....I get really pranky when I drink.
Good night, Dwight. [Jim leaves, Dwight continues crying]
Or a high school girl. Let's go [mouths 'wow' to the camera].
Sure, yeah. [laughs] Hollywood. [Ryan Howard pulls out 3 thick scripts] Alright.
Okay, you need to think about it before you come with the... [Jim bites his lip again and pounds on table]
So, well I lost a ton of money today and I have a mortgage, so I'm a little pissed too.
DVDs! Five movies. What would you bring to the island?  Yes! Meredith?
Customers have to use the coupon code from the website.  And as of now there is no differentiation between the letter O and the zero, but we are working on that. Stay tuned for that.
Well, I'll be the judge of that. What do you got?
No, I just... I heard something about that. It's just, I kind of put it all on the line. Twice, actually. And she said no. Twice.
Great. [to a group of guests]  Just wanna let you guys know that we will be taking the tour like I promised-
I have never played squash. But I have seen it in countless 80's movies and it seems like the most common mistake is that you serve too hard and hit yourself right in the squash balls. So, as long as I don't do that, I think I'll be alright.
Pre-conference room meeting with Dwight went really well.
No, because the office isn't what I'd consider a romantic place.
So do you want me to stay here and, you know, stand next to the box?
I don't think we have to do this again cause it's gonna take a whole. [everyone clinks glasses]
Awesome! Good to be back. The place looks really good.
Good. I like it. You know what. Pretend to smoke. [Dwight pretends to smoke]
All right, here we go everybody. May the manliest man win. Go.
Ok, look. I know you are giving this speech on your own
Ok, Dwight! Come on. Here, I think I have an idea.
You two are so evenly matched I don't know how one of you is going to get the upper hand.
[whistling, places cup of coffee onto Dwight's desk] Ahh, Thank you hands. Nothing else in the universe can do what you do.
[presses button on headset] Hello, this is Dwight.
It is... more of a spicy brown, actually.
Oh wow. This is my niece Vanessa. She's a trumpeter. And, look at her.
Yes, it is very stressful. You sure everything's okay?
What could he possibly stand to gain from a fake juggling routine?
Yeah, woah. [deeper voice] Yep, absolutely, go ahead.
Hey guys, sorry to interrupt, I uh, just found this on my desk. [shows picture of Cici with devil doodles] Need to talk to somebody about it. Can you believe that?
You know what? Can I have the weekend to decide?
Oh that sounds fun. I'm mountain biking on Sunday. On Montage Mountain.
[nervous laughter] Right. Okay, uh, over the next three months...
Are you serious? [starts typing on the computer and Andy begins to lean in toward the computer]
Thank you. Hey, we should be fine if we leave around 11:20.
I don���t know. I���ve always wanted to own a bike shop, but what about you?
Swore I wouldn't tell anyone this, but in the interest of revealing secrets. Oh my God, this will make your brain explode. Umm, Dwight and Angela dating. Have been for six months.
And you went to New York to do this.  So when you come back you come back the right way. Right?
Yeah, I know, I'd just like to settle in and get a good night's sleep.
Hey, Dwight. I was trying to do something nice for Pam.  Can you just, help me out? Can we maybe take this thing somewhere? Or do something to not make this the worst day ever?
No, we definitely can talk about it in the next--
Yes, I just have to take this call anyway so...
Ha ha. No, I don't. No, I don't. Alright, well, I am sore and obviously horrible at this, so- [texting on his phone]
No, let the record show that Dwight K. Schrute is now completely nude and is holding a plastic knife to Stanley's neck?!
[to camera] Who is this guy? We are killing it.
I'm sorry, are you really trying to get us to invest in Jan's company?
Have you asked her what she wants to do?
That's just a figure of speech, you know? Blow your brains out? Come on. All it really means is that we're friends. Who else is she gonna talk to if I'm gone, right? I mean, if she left, I wouldn't blow my brains out. Of course, I would take that job in Maryland. Because it's double the pay, and soft shell crab just happens to be my favorite food.
Here, this is for your elbows, for your elbows.
Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
So I broke up with Katy and haven't been dating anybody else, so this year I don't have to worry about Valentine's Day. It's gonna be good. I invited a couple of friends over. We're gonna play some cards and I'll end up winning a lotta money. Because, they're idiots. It's gonna be great.
Hey you know what? Do you have a rundown that I could take a look at, just so I know what type of rundown you're looking for ?
Yeah, I'm late for work, so I have to brush my teeth, it's a whole routine.
Well, as long as you don't want to alarm people...
Well, I tried to put all the birthdays together at once.
[grunts] Okay, so far, our ideal party consists of beer, fights to the death, cupcakes, blood pudding, blood, touch football, mating, charades, and yes, horse hunting.
Wow. Bridges of Madison County, Legally Blond, these movies are just... .
Oh, just somewhere in the Poconos. I was just surfing.
Oh, I actually talked to my wife and we���d really like to uh you know, invest - get in on the ground floor.
Cathy? It's been great. Fun, normal. [in voiceover] I thought I was gonna be hanging out with stanley on this trip, but he's turned out to be kind of a loose cannon.
Play by the rules. Dwight. All time favorite movie.
You totally have. You have earned this. But maybe I could be with my wife. Kind of the whole reason that I���m here.
Uh, no. No whorehouse. This is Dwight���s night, okay?
Yeah. Not the easiest day to be assistant regional manager.
With our firm, you'll be building equity for long after they've retired your number.
Hey, um... what has two thumbs and hates Todd Packer? [points at self] This guy!
I mean, I can handle any client issues from Philly.
And as you know, I was a paper salesman. [whispers to Darryl] Hey, I find it helps if you just picture everybody naked. [group overhears and chuckles]
[Robert is looking at pictures of a house online] Whoa, looks pretty nice. Got a little bit of a Shining vibe, though.
Let���s not get crazy and ruin our no-nonsense streak, all right? So, for instance, if you���re expecting a fax today, please don���t yell out, ���Michael J. Fax from Fax to the Future.��� Ok? That���s nonsense.
Yeah. It���s real. It���s the only way you���ll learn. OK, and go ahead. [Phyllis carefully makes her way through the obstacle course] Oh, god, nice! She���s through the green, everybody. Here comes yellow, real doozy. Careful!
Yep. Wait, and this. [hands Dwight a hammer]
[on phone] Yeah, no, it seems to be going great. Andy got beat up by a fifth grade girl?
Great. Guys, can I just have a moment alone with Michael?
Guys, we cannot do these performance reviews, okay? If we go into them, you're basically accepting Nellie as your manager, and trust me, you do not want her as your manager.
Well, I got a text from RC inviting me to come down so I think that's gonna make us roomates.
But maybe I'm here for a reason, because I might have some good ideas, too. I've been sitting out there, and I've been learning a lot, and maybe I can just bring something different to the table.
Great.  Hey, how do you feel about starting an Employee of the Month program?
Ok, ok. We are so close. All we have to do is figure out that corner and we're basically there.
Yeah. Do you want me to take these on my way out?
I know this was really weird, and it was really hard. But I think we're making progress. So I'm really sorry that I have to go but let's keep at this. Ok?
[sounds of a car crash] What was that...
Aw man, I would but I can't miss any more work.
[on phone] I'm sorry, I thought you'd want to know that I saw a bedbug in my room. But, never mind, sorry to interrupt.
���Got your text, awesome idea. Let's hit the links next time you're in PA��� Dash JH.
I bought those boat tickets the day I saw that You Tube video.  I knew we'd need a back-up plan.  The boat was actually Plan C.  The church was Plan B and Plan A was marrying her a long, long time ago.  Pretty much the day I met her.
Oh, I don't think that is what's happening.
Well, I saw - oh your Dundies. I'm surprised they're not out on the coffee table for everybody to see.
Tom Witochkin. One of my best buddies, actually.
Not that Ryan Howard. Um, the Phillies' first baseman.
Dwight? Why are you such a jerk? I am trying to do something for my wife and you keep derailing-
Yeah, you did win. You did win. Anyway, I'm going to need three copies of each of these, stapled and collated. [begins to walk away, then turns back] Totally kidding. [leans in, whispers] I'm gonna need four. [kisses Pam]
Oh, yeah, well don't worry about it.  We'll figure it out.  We'll be okay.
[arm around Pam] Thank you for trying to defend her. But actually, Pam is pregnant, and we can prove it.
I don't know because I everything I own is there.
Hey, how am I doing as your desk mate, by the way? You probably miss Clark.
[mimicking Stanley] I enjoy the tangy zip of Miracle Whip.
[Pam kisses Jim on the cheek] Eleven months.
Oh, is it my turn? Ooh, I'm on the spot. I don't know. Um... you know what? I think I'm good.
But best case scenario, you thought it was a quarter.
Oh, you know who might be good? Mike Tibbets.
Well, with her being unmarried... knocked up by some guy, I mean the yakity-yaks in this office would have a field day.
It is transfer, extension, and then transfer again.
Okay. I think the best thing to do right now is just come clean and tell everybody the truth.
Hey! Can I talk you? For a second?
Hi. How are ya? Good to see you.
No, no - this is a representation of how we feel. And how we feel is: really sorry.
Alright guys, it's a work day and you guys work here, so let's go do some work.
So sadly, it's the best idea on the table.
All right, what the heck? Let's do it.
Get up. All right? I'm not gonna let you by.
Gettin��� a lot of mileage out of this, aren���t ya?
Okay, quick. Who says moustache? [Pam, Oscar, Dwight, and Creed raise their hands]
[Gently taps Pam on the forehead] Tied up.
Nope. When Jo's here, can you work in 'Shagadelic, baby,' at least three times in a conversation? Oh, and when I cough can you do jazz hands?
I am not surprised that Dwight's using my baby to steal my desk. I'm a little surprised that it's working.
Now, wait a minute.  You're not gonna punch a wall, or me, or anything like that if you don't win the point, are you?
Ok, we didn't dance.  I was totally joking anyway.  I mean, it's not really a date if the girl goes home to her fiance.  Right?
I know Pam better than anyone in this office, and obviously she's gone crazy, but everybody wants to say that I'm crazy.  But I'm not crazy, she's crazy.  I'm not crazy, she's crazy.  [reading from various books]  Five to seven minutes.  Five to seven minutes.  Six minutes.  Different, but not really.  Five to seven minutes.
No need.  I saw him do it.  I can try it.
Let's see, since I saw you an hour ago?
Ah, this is just me and David, if that's okay.
No, we decided it was crazy not to worry about it.
No, you're not. I'm looking right at you.
Here you go again! What is your deal today?
Well that's an invasion of privacy, so, I'm going to tell Michael.
[whispering, going into the bathroom with Cece] Okay. Okay. There's my girl. All right. Hold on one second. There we go. What's that face for? Oh, my-oh, my God. Cece, no. No, no, no, not on the dress! Cece, stop!
���Together we will win this baseball game against the evil space Yankees. Eat Fresh.���
Michael, we only told our parents last week.
To be honest, I still can't believe he didn't call her back. Who doesn't call a dork like that back?
Mmmhmm. And the first thing they teach you is that you've got to be true to your self. And you are all about authority.
If your client likes Italian food, you bring him to Cugino's.  And if your client likes a little action, you bring him a gambler.  And if your client hates Cornell, you bring him Andy.
It's ringing. Does anybody have his name? Quick.
Well... that's not gonna hold up in court.
Well, it's not a snowball, 'cause it's only a dusting. Right?
No! My wife does not believe in ghosts.
You���re not serious, right? I mean, how is that fair? I���m in Philly. These are my days in Philly. You���ve agreed to this.
[sees a pole poking out Dwight���s pant leg] What are you up to? Oops look out! [grabs Dwight's wallet]
Okay.  I know, I know.  But my iPod is in the go bag.  We'll be fine.
See, you're always saying there's something wrong with society, but... maybe there's something wrong with you.
Whoops.  Is that really what Ryan wanted you to tell us?
Oh, there's no game.  We're just trying to get these chips for Karen.
Ahh, I love staring off in one direction. If I���m not looking south, I���m not livin���.  That���s what I always say.
Well, we were just looking for Ryan, so he's not here.
Or it could be a half hour, if you need it to be...  Can we get a late checkout?  I don't...  I don't think she heard me.
You know, at the end of the day, it���s really only two days. I mean, I���ll be back in the office. ��If you need me for an emergency, call me. ��I���ll be there...
No, Michael, people are blindfolded. That's a hazard.
No, let's let her rest.  I'm sure there's still twelve on each.
[looks extremely confused] No. No! Wait, but, I mean, you're Dwight, and then... he's the... [trails off]
Ok, you know what? Andy probably has the number for this guy. I'm gonna find him.
Yeah, we did. Hey, how long���how long do we think that���s gonna take?
Wow, that's weird. Oh, dollar for a stapler, that's pretty good.
Ok. So, we're going through all the wedding plans and, boy, it is complicated.
No. You don't need the bathroom. You've got it. Go.
This is actually a big potential sale, so...
Dwight was the top salesman of the year at our company. He wins a little prize money and gets honored at some convention. It is literally the highest possible honor that a Northeastern Pennsylvania-Based Mid-size Paper Company Regional Salesman can attain, so...
The three words I would describe you as is aggressive, hostile and definitely difficult.
Love me, say that you love me. Fool me, fool me, go on and fool me.
Michael, I think... you did the best you could, but this is bigger than all of us.
Would you do me a favor and connect me to Ryan?
I said forget it. [drop kicks lunch across room, stomps on it]
Yeah, if Michael Scott did your home movie!
You will never want to leave your room.
Okay alright. [gets up] I'm really sorry, uh, I just have to say it. I'm-I'm married. I'm very happily married.
I think it has something to do with Survivor, but I'm not sure.
Michael and Jan seem to be playing their own separate game and it's called 'Let's see how uncomfortable we can make our guests' and they're both winning. So I'm going to make a run for it. [holds cellphone]
But, the fact remains we gotta move these boxes.
Pam? Did I ever have a 'thing' for her? No, why? Did she say something?
Will do. [hangs up]  I'll stop calling.  [walks into lobby]
[ambulance pulls away in parking lot] Now what?
Oh, come on, it can always get better. Right?
Sure I am. I am... one of the Men in Black guys. [to Pam, under his breath] Can I have your sunglasses?
In school, we learned about this scientist who trained dogs to salivate at the sound of a bell by feeding them whenever a bell rang. For the last couple of weeks I've been conducting a similar experiment.
No, I mean, great detective work.  'Cause this must be the first case you've ever cracked, right?
Basketball? It was kind of my thing in high school. And I'm, yeah, I'm looking forward to playing. You know, I think I'm gonna impress a few people in here.
Oh, don't worry about it. Dwight, its okay. You were wrong.
I would love for everyone to just forgive me. But, if that's not happening, I'm not averse to just buying them all off.
You can't fire me. You're acting manager. Not office manager. So you have no firing powers.
The Stamford branch is closing and everybody's just packing up their stuff. Andy Bernard made these tasteful hats.
We tried to find the fairest way to do it.
Michael, it's not about... I transferred because of Pam.
What?! You have a cake. You have a delicious cake, with your name spelled correctly?
How did you get this number? Michael, we're on a catamaran.
OK. Yeah, you know what, we're just gonna throw you in. Because more the merrier, right?
Oh good, so we don't have to work.
Wow, what a surprise. That's crazy. You guys get to meet the little heck-raisers.
The big gun thing. [Dwight grabs at phone] Stop!
All right. Now I think it's time for you to go.
Well, that was certainly an odd lunch. Is everything alright?
I mean, a performance-based raise sounded like a good idea, right?
[to Michael] Hey! It's almost your last day, come sit with us.
[noticing that everyone is giving him a sympathetic look] How does everyone know already?
Dwight! Thank God you're here. As it turns out, one of our biggest clients is a ping pong master, and I have to play him tomorrow, or we lose the account. Can you help me out? Will you help me practice?
I wouldn���t be too sure about that. Just saying.
But before he does so, I told him that he should dye his hair to go undercover.
Yeah, right. I mean, unless they���re willing to pass some tests.
Hey Kev, what were you saying before about the paperwork?
I would love, love, love to go. Only problem is, Pam's at home with the baby and I think she wants a night in.
Well - who? How did you? Who, who told you this?
That's a good one. [a red sports car drives up] Whoa, Stanley! Did you just come back from burning down a rival nightclub?
Dwight, how about this? Instead of boycotting, you and I, together, go down to that store and we teach those snobs a lesson.
Those are like my favorite movies. I didn't really think you could win Desert Island, but I think you just did.
What I���m about to say makes no logical sense, and yet, it might be the most logical thing I���ve ever said.
[at the Halpert residence as Cece twirls in the front yard, exiting front door] Pam, we gotta go. Cece, go back inside. Grandma���s got breakfast, OK? [to camera] We are going to Roy���s wedding. Yep, Roy. I think the only weird thing about going to your wife���s ex-fianc�����s wedding on a weekday at eight AM is that it���s your wife���s ex-fianc��.
You know what you should do? Take a vacation.
I have to.  Pam, if I'm not there, someone's going to go to jail.  Or die.
Yeah. Okay. Oh. I dare you to make an announcement.
I saw the movie. I just don't know every line from the film.
No, I did that before, it added nothing.
[watching baseball game on TV] Some girl came into Pam's room crying about her roommate stealing her soy milk. So I'm in here waiting it out.
[walks quickly to break room, opens cabinet and finds mugs of Oscar, Creed and Phyllis]
Yeah, but you're gonna need a permit for that.
I think I left my wallet in your house.
I don't know probably just gonna eat my ham and cheese sandwich in the break room.
Alright.  I'll tell everybody here that you say hi.
You're not allowed to take off your pants in the middle of the office.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, game face, baby, game face.
Ok. Right. Oh, so this morning we are having breakfast together and I just looked up from my cereal and I said, ' You know what I want to do today? I want to marry you.'
You absolutely should. He said it was ok, so till you get him, I'll just be in, you know. [closes door behind him to supply closet]
Huh, you think she is jealous about having a baby?
Oh, I'm sorry. Are you sitting here now?
[flashback to Beach Games] How are your feet?
Oh man, that's crazy.  Right as we were on our way out too.
Can I just talk to you for a second?
[As he's walking out] That's enough, I'm done! Okay? Agh!
So smug. Like he thought it was funny, like this.
[in unison] I do not think that is funny.
So... I think, yeah, I think getting these out of the way might be productive.
Its sports marketing basically. But the athletes are partners.
Wow, you got totally taken for a ride Beesley.
[Reading Pam's palm, while she has on extremely padded gloves] Wow, that is really interesting.
Jim Halpert. What? How did you get this number? Stalker.
Alright. Well we'll be there in ten minutes.
I was just thinking that because this person is gonna be sitting at my desk, near my wife���
Ok. You shouldn't be telling me that stuff and also shouldn't be taking two hour lunches without telling me.
I've gotta go, but you know what? Team Halpert, ok? You're gonna crush it, you're gonna smash it.[Pam laughs] OK, good luck!
I need you to stay right here while you think about it.
Hey, can I talk to you guys for a second?
Okay. There���s no possible way I can get there, so just ask Phyllis. She can be your older sister or something.
Yup, looks like the Scranton people and the Stamford people are finally coming together. And that's what you want, right?
Well not until Friday 20% off toner cartridges, that's a big deal.  While we're on the subject, why don't I just run you down to the hospital and we'll just do a quick check?
Really what it is, is about the money the sales staff brings into the office.
Oh, I can't because I keep them hidden. I don't want to look at them and get cocky.
Well, it could happen. Have you ever seen the movie Outbreak?
Okay. I was wondering if you ever did any couple���s counseling.
[to Eric] You're gonna regret that when you find yourself between a moose and her cubs.
Come on, man. She goes to New York in like 10 minutes.
Well, then why are you wasting everybody else's time interrogating them?
Oh, I thought you asked me what our chances were in being murdered here tonight.
Newsflash, the whole thing needs to go in the car.
Okay. Um, while you were typing that I searched every database in existence and learned every fact about everything.  And mastered the violin.  Oop, and sold more paper.
You know I just wish, I wish, I had the investigative powers to smoke some of these guys out.
Dwight has made me his bestisch mensch. Which is Schrute for best man. He���s putting himself entirely in my hands tonight. And I know for over 12 years I���ve done nothing but trick and prank him but tonight���only good surprises. ���Guten Pranken���. [chuckles]
[ignoring Dwight] All right, guys, good day, a lot of candidates. Let's discuss.
Well, you know you can't actually poison him.
K, Kevin, are you saying ���See the world���? or ���Sea World?���
That's true. Um... dinner sounded delicious. Pam I'll see you at home, thank you so much.
I can't believe we're here, I can't believe this is happening.
No, no, no. Not ever, 'cause that's not gonna happen.
We were... I think she was just trying to-
That is a lie, that is a lie.
Oh, my God, thank you. [hugging both] Thank you.
Um, this one interesting the power comes from the font in this one. 'Schrute Space,' very medieval, very England. Um, this one's forceful, this one's very Dwight. 'Quiet! Dwight Schrute Working,' it's good.
I'm sorry, how did you think I was expected to guess that?
Oh, right, because you announced that his ship was sinking?
[on phone] I just want to make a point to that last caller. I disagree. I don't think it is the running game at all. I think we do have to make a few moves in this off-season.
Oh! Right! Right, right, right, come-ah on, on, on. [to everyone] Ladies and gentlemen! Gather around! We have one more participant. Come on, be polite. Be polite. [to Katy] Desert Island. Five movies. Go.
Well, we went on a Segway tour and we're awesome at it and Frank and Beans!
Slowly, slowly.  Let's just get to the elevator.
Um... okay. Ah, you know what? Maybe I'll... I'll finish explaining the rules. Let's... let me explain it first, and then...
Not to mention the extra night's sleep in the hospital will be very nice because once we bring the baby home, if it's crying all night, one of us is going to have to take care of it.  And I do not plan on helping unless it's a boy.
How do you hate it? It's a cake.
You know what?  Instead of a game, why don't we do an exhibition?  I'd love to see that dunk of yours.
You threw the summoning bag at me, sir?
All right. Let's move on. Let's move on to the main event. Who Would You Do?
Dwight, why don't we just hold off with the human pyramids for a while?
Andy, we're gonna do our best. But you know what? At the end of the day seven point...whatever percent is pretty good.
We decided to have a Valentine's day lunch and then that way we can spend the entire night with Cece and avoid the Valentine's day dinner thing. It's a whole thing.
Okay, okay, okay. Why don't we just put this to a vote, and then we'll be done with it.
[Sighs] I'm having second thoughts about one of the shirts I packed. The blue one with the stripes.
Oscar, yes. You're right to stop it. Thank you. Eject it.
Ok, Dwight. We can't do that. So why don't you just tell us what happened?
Yes it does. Yes it does my friend. Ok, we will be competing for gold, silver and bronze yogurt lids.
That whole lifestyle, his whole vibe, you find that appealing?
Thank you. I've noticed we've been having a lot of conference room meetings.
Ahem. This is for you... and [puts blanket around her shoulders] ...Happy Birthday, Kel.
OK. [to Ryan] Wow, thanks for taking all the excuses, dude.
Oh, also, while you���re at it, if you did have a salt packet, three tacks and some aspirin, that would be great. Oh, wow. You have that.
Well, I don't know, if Kevin's in accounting, and Toby's in Human Resources and they're talking...
So this possible client they're talking about, actually a big deal.  It's Lackawanna County.  Our whole county.  And if we get this, they may not have to downsize our branch.  And I could work here for years.  And years.  [groan] Years.
I'm just killing Germans, any way I can.
[Christian Slater impression] So you've been shown a nonsensical video. You're probably wondering, 'What's going on?' Well, you're not alone.
Well, I should hope so. [Michael takes phone] Who is this?
Did it? It might have come up while we were waiting for you.
The minister just told me that it���s tradition for the Bestish Mensch to be older than the groom.
Oh... man. I thinke when I started to see you go in I think I just froze.
Is there something about being a manager that makes you say stupid things?
Just thought that I heard crying, moaning, or something in here.
Turns out, a lot of parents want the very best for their children. That's weird.
It expired in August, and my cell phone charger from two years ago.
[collects Dwight's weapons from around the office; holds up a hand scythe]
Oh, it's on uh Linden Ave?  By the quarry?
I am on the two kid sleep schedule so I'm up and at 'em at four fifteen, but no kids, so I honestly didn't know what to do with myself, and then I thought of something. Uh- [hears door, hides]
That's great. Well don't tell me who it is, cause I can ..
[Holds up Hooters t-shirt] Just you know politics, literature.
Perhaps your year of experience managing this branch will come in handy.
[aims imaginary camera at Pam] Click. Oh, you blinked. Damn it. Now that's in my brain forever.
Dwight, sometimes it takes couples years to get pregnant.
No, I mean, you guys really seem to have a strong connection.
I don���t know, for such a crazy number I���d like something pretty crazy.
I got Stanley tickets to see Lewis Black for his birthday. ...Might not have been the best idea.
I... why don't we go back to this animation.
I'm really sorry if that's weird for you to hear, but I needed you to hear it. Probably not good timing, I know that. I just...
Well I thought that, I figured you should hear it from me rather than, I mean you know Michael.
Right now, this is just a job. If I advance any higher in this company then this would be my career. And uh, well, if this were my career, I'd have to throw myself in front of a train.
Actually, we've been dating for a couple months.
Yeah, you don't have to, ummm.  Alright, yes, that's not gonna be awkward at all.
OK, with all due respect to everyone here, I think the most worthy opponent of you is you.
I'm excited, I've actually never been to Gettysburg. Uh, my family was gonna go once, but then my brothers convinced me if was full of dead soldier zombies, so I freaked out and we turned the car around. But I'm older now, I can outrun a zombie.
[On phone in hallway] No, I know I need to work, I just- I feel weird not being home.
I don't know though. I mean, you know that was a hit.
And I was just going to go through the system cause I didn't think you'd be there. Why, why are you still there?
Truthfully anything would have been better than that prank. [laughs] Oh, text message from my brother. 'Pam cool. Welcome to the family.'
Dwight, you've really never stolen any company time?
Yeah, I never even knew that part of the office existed. [Pam chuckles] Hey, who's that guy? [Jim points to Stanley]
Okay, Oscar, I'm not saying you're not dreamy, because you are, but isn't it possible that he was just schmoosing a voter?
We can offer our biggest discounts on 30% recycled and ultra-premium laser.
If I didn���t do certain things without telling Pam, she���d be married to Roy. [chuckles]
You gotta be kidding me. Who isn't jumping?
Oh yeah. I have the one that nobody has. Is there anything interesting?
Those are the books that sum up the other books.
This morning the phone guy comes in, and he shows Michael that the phones have a PA function. And then he just left.
[on phone]  Hi, yeah.  This is Mike from the West Side Market.  Well, we get a shipment of Herr's salt and vinegar chips, and we ordered that about three weeks ago and haven't ... . yeah.  You have 'em in the warehouse.  Great.  What is my store number... six.  Wait, no.  I'll call you back. [quickly hangs up] Shut up [to Karen].
Hey, it's Jim. Listen, this is important. Are you busy?
Oh ho! Look who's back reporting for duty.
That might be a little difficult with the one computer.
Oh, I'm sorry I don't know... what we're talking about...
[silently counting] Three, two, one... [Erin turns on the office lights, all laugh loudly]
Some might even say that we had our first date last night.
I don���t know how else to tell you.
Six point five days. [winces as Kevin smacks him on the back]
There's the rundown you asked for. I may have expanded some areas that you weren't prepared for.
That is good. That's it. That's what it is.
What time is it here? Um, we're in the same time zone.
Nnnno.  Uh, turns out, it was just a really bad idea involving fire.  But I think I fixed it.
When I was ten years old, my parents took me to Disney world. I cried the whole time. I was not able to comprehend the beauty that was before me. ��I just wanted... to go home. ��This is what the Pyramid will do for you. It is the bridge to the world. It has a usb port. Wireless... will be available in 2013. ��You can play Anything from Chuck to Cars 2. With the Pyramid, you have the connection to everything -- in time... and space.
Oh. Andy. I thought of one last tact you can take with Pam.
I'm not gonna let you stop me from thinking.
Nope. You're, you're doing a great job of it in my fantasy right now. [Pam sighs]
Nos? You mean like in fast and furious?
I was talking about my wife and how she believes in ghosts. And then we had a little debate and Meredith said she believes in them too.
I think you could just do Andy Bernard.
Oh, Andy.  You know what?  We don't have a
Alright, alright, gang. Let's just settle down. You're yelling in her face.
There is no inner circle.  Deangelo just prefers to delegate a few things, to a few guys.
Uh, on a scale of one to ten, I'd say I'm about a four.
You know what? I bet a lot of them are wedding crashers.
Ever since I was a little kid, like, eight or nine, I could sort of control things with my mind.
Oh, hey, Mee-Maw, would you watch Cece for a second? Don't worry. She's asleep. I'm just gonna track down some more chairs.
Are you sure you���re okay with me putting in this much money.
I like the wild card.  I'm already liking the wild card.
Okay. I can���t say that that���s not fair.
Because the insurance company only covers two nights.
Okay. I���ll see you in a little bit.
I don't know. [looks at Stanley, who took his mug and is drinking out of it] Oh! That's... not... yours.
That's right. The janitor said that. By the way, the raccoons are back.
OK, you know what? Why don't we just call animal control...
[imitating game announcer] You win. [Darryl throws empty can on floor] How good did that feel?
So that he can have us rob a bank, and then escape through the sewers.
We don���t need a warning signal, Kevin. We can see him right there-
Michael stands in the front of the boat and says that he's king of the world within the first hour, or I give you my next paycheck.
So as it turns out, tonight is my nephews T-ball game and I kinda missed the first three, so...
Thank you. I like being appreciated. But, to speak my truth, it wasn't out of the way because I felt like a tea anyway. So, one trip.
Oh, thank God. I have such a headache from that glare.
We have a lot to do, and you are... putting up a very effeminate sign. Is that what you've been doing, is making a sign?
I don���t know what you want me to tell you, man. All I know is that every time I���ve been faced with a tough decision, there���s only one thing that outweighs every other concern. One thing that will make you give up on everything you thought you knew, every instinct, every rational calculation.
Oh, man I don't know. Uh, dinner, drinks, movie, matching tattoos.
No! Stop! Stop stop stop stop! You're way over! Ok, you gotta cut it! Cut it hard! (bleep!) Stop stop stop stop! Stop, stop! Dammit Dwight. Great.
Hey man, you mind if I run something by you?
[sighs] I don't know what you want me to tell you. To be really honest, my wife works here. And I love it. She literally makes me work harder. She makes me smarter. She makes me remember why I'm here. And between us, she's on maternity leave right now, and I would love to leave this room and see her face. I would love it. I don't know how this helps, but it's just what I'm thinking.
Are you really gonna marry him?  [Pam nods] ...Ok.
Nothing. I just wanted to congratulate you on your condo.
Whoa, pull it back. Uhm, why did you hire Todd Packer?
[back to Pam] Actually, you know what? Give me one second, okay? Make yourselves at home.
Yeah, the crazy thing about that is, um, wow you look great. Did you lose some weight?
Speaking of which, I meant to tell you. Very impressive, the uh, donation you gave to Oscar's charity. What was it? 25 bucks?
We were just kids.  What did we know?
Hey Jo, it's Jim Halpert. I actually scheduled a meeting at 7:30 with a very important client. And it's so weird, because we never have meetings after 5pm. But I was hoping that maybe just this once, it would be okay.
Definitely not.  If anything it was a tie.
I am currently reading incoherent riddles on blue index cards to find vital information that Michael has hidden all over the office. How are you?
Nice to meet you, yeah.  Whew!  I can assure you we don't need a new system though.  Happy with ours.
You know what? I'm actually going to have to call you back. Thank you. Sorry about that.
Uh, ok, I think we need to take him to the hospital because I'm pretty sure he has a concussion.
[trying to stop him] Whatever you wanna do in your spare time is up to you!
I was blue group, so it was second from the top.
So, as it turns out, Dwight is right. How bizarre.
Not enough? I don���t know how else to explain it to her, so, you know what? I know it���s against the rules but I���m gonna need a favor from you guys.
Nope I don't, remember when you told us not to make plans 'cause we're working.
I don't know. This conversation really got away from me.
[looking at resume] Uh oh, this former administrative assistant misspelled 'administrative' and 'assistant.'
Andy revealed himself to be a double agent.  At which point Dwight felt comfortable revealing that he also was double agent.  And then Michael announced to everybody that - get this- he was a double agent.  Oh, and it is 6:00.
What? My shoe is untied. What is your problem? [Pam laughs] Oh my God, you thought I wa--- oh.
And say what?  'Hey Deangelo, are you shy or just a sexist?'
So we had to park at a satellite parking lot over there.
Wow, what do you put our chances at?
I called the manufacturer, who referred me to distributor, who referred me to the vending machine company, who told me that they sell them in the machines in the building next door.
Is this real? [Pam dumps Michael's screenplay on Jim's desk]
Okay, what can I do to make you believe me?
You really think you can make it up to me with food?
I ain���t fraid of no ghost. [Pam holds up drawing of a hand with the middle finger raised] Whoa!
Oh, good, phew,  thank god you said that.
Greatness is only skin deep, some people say...
I'm sure they'll want to meet her, too.
I'm not gonna- [cuts himself off, Kevin walks in]
Dwight. Dwight. [Dwight's car comes screeching into view]
I think it'll take you a little longer than that.
Oh, my God!  Look at her!  baby, she's so beautiful!  Oh, my God.
We were thinking somewhere between five - ten thousand? I can do the full ten thousand. We should just - [blows air] - all in.
No, I don't think we should be trying to make this place seem unpleasant. I think we should let this place just crush her spirit by itself. I mean, it knows what it's doing.
I am on the first hot sale streak of my life. I think it all comes from feeding Cece, because no matter how much she resists, I sell her those carrots. Let's be honest--if I can make mushed carrots seem better than a boob... I can pretty much sell anything. [laughs]
Thank you for all of this. This is so helpful. You know what? One last question. Um, who is that fine older gentleman in the corner? [points to Creed]
Yeah, I do. C'mon. [they hold hands and cross street]
Meredith was the perfect choice to play the head of the company. Her lunch break lined up with our appointment with Danny and...that's it. That's really all we were looking for.
Listen to me. Robert is going to veto the Sabre store.
No, dude, no, I was just, listen! Whoa.
Something cool. Like, sports marketing or... that sound something like you'd be into?
I literally did not know that existed until this moment.
[clears throat] Right to voicemail. [into phone] Hey, Ryan, it's Jim. You know what? Totally disregard that last voicemail, because you obviously have your hands tied. Good luck! [hangs up]
Oh, it���s the girls. Hey Pam. What? Angela���s been kidnapped! Phyllis left the door open and some freak came and grabbed her and fled.
Doesn't matter what the name is. Se��or Loadenstein, that's stupid.
[getting up quickly to silence Michael] No, no. Nope.
Oh, I don't really do that. But Pam might have some friends, though.
No, I didn't. I just logged it in right here, so...
Yeah. It's weird being away from them. Never done this before.
Michael, look I'll just be honest with you.  Earlier today I spoke with Wallace about a promotion.  I actually think that talk went really well.  And then after he spoke with you, for some reason it felt like things had changed.
Hey, what's that show that she's always talking about?
And I'm wondEring if perhaps those are a bit, um--
Take it slow. 'Cause it seems like a lot of the time things like that need... [Ryan walks in]
You are really good at modesty. She���s a genius.  She painted this incredible mural in the kids��� room. There���s a hippo leading a parade of 500 children���
No, I would like to get back to work, actually, please.
This is my biggest sale of the year. They love me over there for some reason. I'm not really sure why but I make one call over there every year, just to renew their account, and that one call ends up being 25% of my commission for the whole year, so I buy a mini bottle of champagne, celebrate a little. And this year I'm pushing recycled paper on them for one percent more. I know. I'm getting cocky. Right?
So how does it work? It���s like, you know, the action of talking to a third party breaks up the log jam, or���
Time. Space. Gender. [Dwight mouthing words] There are no rules anymore. All boundaries are breaking down in the wake of the infinite future. The only thing that -- the only thing that remain -- the only thing that remains are the things that have stood the test of time -- love, values, and of course, the pyramids -- the strongest shape ever constructed, a shape that fits all other shapes inside of it. [softly] No, that���s --
[closes folder] You know what? Uh, I really don't think I should be doing this stuff anymore, you know?
Charles is having Kevin cover the phones for a while. How do I say this diplomatically? [pause] I think Kevin is doing exactly as well as anyone might have expected someone like him to perform in a position like that.
Wow. But then who would watch my TV? That is...
Yes, conference room in five minutes... No. No. We're gonna solve it right here. We're actually gonna talk about it out here. So, who has problems with the birthday thing? [everyone raises hands] One, two, three, everybody. OK, so then we just shouldn't do it.
Yes, I can. [Cathy laughs] uh, all right. I'm really sorry. I think we'll just��� we'll just watch. You can watch, not watch, whatever you want to do. Take another shower, I don't care.
You know, she also gave me a reason to think that maybe she wasn't a good fit.
It's Mose. Who do you think it is?
I should've grabbed you. I'm sorry. Look, I thought I could've done today's sales call alone. I mean, I may never be as good a salesman as you are, but I at least need the chance to do the job.
Well, I actually agree with her, I think you should talk to him.  And you also might want to explain to Andy that no one wants to help him decide whether or not he has a rash.
OK. Three hundred boxes of twenty pound white. That's seventy-five boxes per person, so that's not so bad.
Well, that is because that is the gift that keeps on giving. Oh, my God. I left today's paper on my desk.
Wow, that's exciting! But until you firm up the idea, you might want to keep it between us.
Hey, Ryan. Could you start consolidating all our Rolodex information into Outlook?
Yeah. Hey, can I talk to you about something?
You know what? You're sitting, and thinking, and it's probably better if it comes from me anyway.
OK, here we go... Digest of business terms, CliffsNotes on business economics, and a sales encyclopedia.
Oh, you know what? This reminds me, Cece needs a new toothbrush.
[Michael playing air guitar on pool table] Wow. Maybe we should tell her that he's not normally like this.
You know, Andy, you could just say a really nice goodbye.
No. [Andy gets up from his desk] Stay there. Kev, thought we nailed the whole transfer thing earlier.
[sitting on a stack of paper] Yeah, well, if you're only free till three on Sunday and I can't get there till one, then it's gonna be pretty tight.
Yeah I told her a long time ago she could do it.
I know, I mean the way I see it is you can deface any picture of me, any one, pick one. Not my kid though.
It���s pretty great, right? I mean, we���re coming along��� [to coworker] Hey, Wade, we gotta just push up Dennis���s timeline
Cece���s ballet recital is today. I cannot wait. I���ve been working with her on her move. It���s called the Cece Spin and Kiss. Do you want to see it? It���s kind of like this. It���s pretty cute, right?
[shaking hands with Abby] Ow, ow, ow, ow, you broke my hand.
Sure. Michael's a good teacher. A teacher is someone who stands right next to you your whole life and never lets you do anything. That's what a teacher is, right?
That reminds me, uh, if the invitation still stands, Pam and I would love to have dinner tonight.
OK. I have just convinced Dwight that he needs to go to Stamford and... [Pam starts laughing]... spy on our other branch. No no no.
And if you want Michael as Santa, raise your hand. [Michael, then Dwight raises hand]  Can I get you some punch?
Maybe it should come from a note... with flowers...tomorrow.
It's, okay, it's Jim.  Just say again, uh, really loudly what happened.
[listening to and editing Jo's book on tape]
You cut more than you had to, didn't you?
Oh okay, she's going into labor. Make way, everybody!
I started biking into work. Josh does it and he lives a lot farther away than I do. And also it saves gas money, keeps me in shape... helps the environment. And now I know it makes me really sweaty for work.
So, the plan was seven minutes.  But we're calling an audible, because that's her call.  Because she's the quarterback.  I'm just the left tackle who happened to get her pregnant.
Michael just called the pizza place with a list of demands.
Hey uh, Michael.  Don't jump on the bouncy castle.  You can't do that, because you're going to get horribly, horribly injured.
[after 'the kiss'] You have no idea how long I've wanted to do that.
You know what?  I'm just going to call a cab from here.
Hey, could you do me a favor? Could you put that in the DVD player?
Well, those things that you consider doodles, I consider art.
I had this huge spider in my baseball mitt.
You know, you don't have to answer calls during a party. Just thought you should know.
Oh, my God. I have never seen that look in a man's eyes... ever. I thought that I might die. On beach day.
Chapter 4 ��� One of the host's most important duties is as Dance Master. A proper courtly dance sets the tone for the entire afternoon.
But what about the assistant assistant to the regional manager?
Pam, I couldn���t get out. I barely made it out just to make this phone call.
For now, yeah. I was spreading myself way too thin���
Okay, so I'll be back in, um-- back in a bit.
I don't really know Ronnie. But I have a feeling I will get to know her very well over the next few years, and eventually declare my love for her.
Dwight, will you go back to the hospital? You were there for like three hours.
Yeah, let's face it. This meeting sounds like it's Wonka fans only. He's never seen the movie. [David laughs]
No, it's just I'm not sure if I um... well to be quite honest with you, Jan, I have a few unpleasant memories of Scranton. And um...
I got this. [taking Katy's bag from Michael]
Andy still doesn't know that Angela's having an affair with Dwight. And it's been seventeen days. I mean, eventually he'll figure it out, when their kids have giant heads and beet-stained teeth. But right now it's just... awkward.
[leaning against Creed's desk] So I am collecting $3 from everybody. For Kelly's party.
I know. Here, Michael, you can court her as you get to know her, you know? I mean, the office is a great place for that. Pam and I, we got to know each other right out there. I mean, the first time we joked around was at my desk. And the first meal we ever had was, in the break room, actually. We were at two separate tables and, I remember that. The first time we kissed even, was right outside, and... Look, all I'm saying is that you can get to know someone really really well, like I did, right here at work.
Hold on, let me think about that, yes, that'll work. But can you sing in a sexy high falsetto voice?
What are you talking about? You're not the boss. Andy is. Andy?
No. No, I just wanted to make sure, it was in the same format. So that distribution list is gonna be my...?
Uh, it has to be a book, Dwight.
And I'm actually pleased to be able to offer you printer cartridges and toner now.
[on the phone] Oh, Dwight, we're so close! Just buy us a few more minutes... Well, they just called me in for an update, so I'll call you right back... Okay... Okay, great. [goes into a private room where Pam and the doctor are, the voices are inaudible, but the camera can see through a window, Pam and Jim look in shock, they hug and Jim goes back out into the hall to call Dwight back, trembling] Hey, Dwight, uh... send in the subs! [laughs] Ohh! [goes back into the room to hug Pam]
Yep, I'm very passionate about Italian food.  In fact, um, I'm in love with Italian food.
Pam can't drink? I didn't-- I shouldn't have said that. I don't know why I did. She can do whatever she wants, though she shouldn't. She shouldn't because she's an alcoholic. Pam is an alcoholic. That's not true. I-- no. What we want-- the real reason is that, that Pam's pregnant.
[Pam walks over to him and smiles excitedly while bouncing, Jim imitates her] Can I do something for ya?
Okay. Are you sure you know how to do video on the phone?
Okay, okay. Um, how 'bout, the ultimate team player? [Pam laughs and types]
Well I'm trying to. Do you see what I'm doing?
Nice.  That's excellent, because bugs love my famous grilled cheese sandwich.
That's honest. [sighs] Alright, fair enough. It was really fun while it lasted though, wasn't it?
Would you hold on one second? That's my other line.
Happy Holidays, Dwight. But do not open it till Christmas.
Could you guys all do me a favor and not talk about this until I tell Pam?
[mimicing Dwight in high-falsetto voice] Hi my name's Dwight Schrute and I would like to buy a purse from you. Good lord, look at these purses! This is something special. Oh my God is this Salvatore Di-chini-asta?
[a text tone goes off] Is that my phone?
[Walks back into The Office] Yep, I did say that.
Oh, this Man In Black thing, what do you think that was about?
So, who will be challenging Kevin in Flonkerton? Anyone?
Bynum, obvious monster and the three point shooting, don't even-... [Jim bites his lip]
[coughs] Oh, big one! Big one! Really big one!
It's time for our first quarter camaraderie event, so pack a swimsuit, a toothbrush, rubber-soled shoes, and a ski mask.'
Lead off with that. She loves hunting. She also loves those ads for Six Flags, with the old guy. [Andy hums Six Flag ad] Got it. Also... do you speak pig latin?
I mean, they just need to communicate, you know?  If they said to each other what they're saying to everyone else, then--
You know what? Why don't you take the rest of the day, figure it out and then come back and tell me what you got.
We���ll see. You are an assistant who���s just gotten a phone message. I am in a meeting with Dwight, Robert Dunder, and his niece. Uh-oh, look who came to join us. The Turkish ambassador to Armenia, Yuri Slovak, who, by the way, is extremely embarrassed about the size of his nose. Go ahead and read that phone message.
Uh, what does -- what does that mean?
Oh, no, sorry, it's an inside joke. There's this bartender at Stamford who, uh... you know what? You'd just have to be there.
[overlapping with Pam] Really, all you had to do was play with her for, like, 30 minutes and then put her to bed.
Oh, we're supposed to call everything we don't want to do ���opportunities.���
Yeah. Whoa. Here's one with his face whited out.
I just did. The answer to that one question told me everything I need to know.
Yeah [laughs and then notices camera] Not that they're not smart people.
How about this? I think our goal should be we don't have meetings unless they're absolutely essential.
Um... let's see, uh...  The customer. Because the customer is king.
Probably the weirdest thing about Pam being gone would be lunch... actually.  But um, it will force me to become acquaintances with people I consider... coworkers.
Hey, Phyllis. Are you just getting back from lunch now?
No, I really, really think Michael is better at being manager for so many reasons.
I was talking about my wife, and how she believes in ghosts. And then we had a little debate. Meredith said she believes in them too.
Buenos dias, Miguel. Como estas? Bien? Claro que si! Yo estoy fantastico. Que pasa?
So, yesterday Dwight found half a joint in the parking lot. Which is unfortunate because as it turns out, Dwight
That is not what I said, and, also, I am co-manager, meaning you are not the only manager anymore. I am also I co-manager.
[yawning] What about an energy drink or something?
Okay. We haven't gone under. We've been sold and that can mean many different things.
[On the phone with Dwight] Hi, Dwight, um, what sort of discounts are we giving on the 20 lb white model.
Well, we���re here. Perfect. ��[covers sleeping Phyllis with his jacket]
I'm gonna help you through it all right?
Pam, he's in a box. He's downstairs, in a box, on the floor, near the shelves. I'm serious. Go down there and work your magic.
I mean, it could be you, Gabe. I mean, that's the point.
Yeah.  Yeah. You know what? Maybe... maybe I will. [starts walking away]
Do you need us for any of this?
Michael referred me to a male strip club called Banana Slings.  Instead, I called the Scholastic Speakers of Pennsylvania.
Hey, Dwight, I don't know if you heard, but we're supposed to be drinking out of weird backpacks instead of cups, like regular people.  Oh, you did hear.
No, it does matter who ends up sitting next to Pam when I���m gone. The people around you are basically who you end up spending your life with. I mean, because of where my desk was, I spent all those years looking at Pam, and I fell in love. So, that stuff matters. Definitely does.
Okay, that is a 'no' on the on the West Side Market.
Alright. Here's the thing okay, you just keep talking to her.  If you hit a stall you have a perfect fall back.
You got to take a chance on something sometime, Pam. I mean, do you want to be a receptionist here, always?
Oh, my God, that's Kevin! Great song, Kev. Oh,  my God, he's the drummer and the singer.
Oh, those are drawings.  In case the writing didn't really put a picture in your head.  And there he is, in the flesh, Agent Michael Scarn.  Now we know what he looks like.
Alright, that's gonna do it for me tonight. Have a lovely evening.
It's my pleasure. [takes phone from Pam] Hello?  Well that's great. [hangs up phone]  Turns out the paper was there all along.
[speaking into the mallard and looking a Dwight] Hi buddy.
Oh, did the press ask for a story?
Can I ask why you're leaving your current job?
Final lap. Final lap. Time to beat is 1:15.
Can I have a ride, man? I... uh... I have my bike.
[reading text] Robert, great offer. Wish I could hit the links with you in Florida but a father of a newborn really should be helping out his wife any chance he gets.
Thanks, Kev. Uhm... I'm actually going on a date.
Ah... would you want to do it on Groundhogs day?
Oh, yeah, so we���ll just do that later.
I can't do that. You won't be able to breathe.
I had plans to meet a friend tonight.  Which I had to cancel.  But this is cool, too. I'm not a complainer.
We gotta get someone else in there right now.
So I'm going to go ahead and save you some time, and tell you that no-one's going to go along with this. But you knew that, right?
You know what? If we all stayed a couple of hours late tonight without Michael distracting us, we wouldn't have to come in at all tomorrow.
Oh. Adorable, right? [opens kiddie bathroom, sees man on toilet] I walked in on someone in the bathroom.
Guys, she is a beautiful movie star, so maybe we should just go to work.
Okay. Have you ever seen the movie Sixth Sense? Maybe you are already dead.
Yes, I have not gotten one either. So, keep going.
No, nope. What else? What else? You watch The Hills? What is Heidi thinking?
But there is a reason why I'm here!
Toby? Mm hmm. [looks back to Michael] I really have to take this Creed, so it was really worth...
Michael, its not how you leave in an office. It how you...
We need to assume that everyone in the office is forming an alliance and is therefore trying to get us kicked off.
This came out really well. [picks up Dwight's I.D. from the laminating machine and hands it to Dwight] There you go.
All I'm saying is that it's a first dates, so just keep a respectful distance.
[Turns off Dwight's music] Whether it's this time or next time.
what is interesting? I just proved that he gives his cell out to everybody.
Listen, guys, I think we all want to know the same thing, right? Who���s the strongest? Well, there���s only one way to solve that ��� flat curl contest.
[bounces ball off wall with Toby] So that's what this sound is all day.
That was beautiful. All her idea too. Awesome. She is so great.
One more.  Why are you talking like that?
And she's trying to correctly butcher a goose, but she's having trouble coming up with it.
Shut up. Mavis Beacon doesn't even type 90.
Good, and it absolutely is a toy. Arigatou.
Pam, I'm really sorry. I- I'm really sorry about...all that. [Dwight smiles at Jim] Really? Smirking?
You don't think you should sit in the back with Dwight?
What would you say if I told you we could pull a prank on Dwight and at the same time not be working?
Oh, well I yell. You've heard me yell.
Maybe if you make fun of yourself it'll all go away.
But they shouldn't be much longer now, so we'll be back soon.
[approaching Reception] Michael Scott, manager.  Hi, how are ya?
I���m on the phone. I���m on the phone.
Not your fault. I'm sorry I misinterpreted our friendship.
Ok to speak my truth, that was a little sarcastic. I think that's a little unfair.
I could have prevented that. So I have to talk to Wallace.
[attempting to move car seat] It's like The Hurt Locker!
They weren���t really talking that much about money. They just said, We���re good with investing and then I...and I...
Listen, I was really wondering if maybe we could lock this down before lunch is over.
[on phone, leaving a message] Hey, Ryan, it's Jim. Look man, I don't know what's gotten into you lately, but you know what? I really don't care, because you're trying to get rid of me. And I bet you don't think I care enough about this job to actually fight back, but you're wrong, because I do, and I will. So you can keep trying to push me out of this place, but guess what? I'm not going anywhere. [hangs up and exhales sharply]
Pretty good. You must be almost out of water.
It's not, it's not Eddie, it's ah, Evan or...
Well, it was redacted. Look, if she wants an invite, maybe she's just trying to be friends.
[Michael has a 'sticky-hand' toy and snags a paper off Jim's desk and then laughs] About a week ago, Michael gave his 2-week notice. And, surprisingly there is a very big difference between Michael trying and Michael not trying.
Uh, you know what though? I feel like I already sicked him on Pam... we'll give her a break. Let's think of someone else.
OK. [as Dwight mixes coffee with dirt in his hand] This is crazy. You can't make a dirt ball.
Hey, are you still in charge of office supplies?
[seeing Cece gone from the couch he left her] Uh, MeeMaw, where's Cece?
[on phone] Hey, Tom. What's that? Oh, you found a golden ticket. [puts hand on receiver and speaks to office] One of my clients found a golden ticket. [Michael screams in excitement] [Jim back on phone] Yup. No, congratulations. [Michael dances in background]
I wouldn't... I wouldn't worry about it. Don't touch it.
Andy ��� this whole idea of our situation being just like war?  It���s just not true.  We just work at a paper company.  And you���re our regional manager.  And guess what man?  You don���t have to prove anything.  We like you as regional manager.  Andy if you don���t believe me take a look at what���s on my head.  I���m wearing a very pink hat.  I���ve been getting weird looks all day because I���m pretty sure ���DM does GB��� means something kinda sexual.  But guess who���s wearing them?  All of us.  Just for you man.  That���s huge.
How do you not spread out the tickets into different shipments?
Oh, right, some drunk guy hit on Pam last year. Said he was grabbing her for balance.
A7557962.' Totally nonsense numbers, but you do what you have to do.
Well, I can't be the only one who didn't -- [sees mugs on Angela's and Meredith's desks]
Okay, you could just say you don't know what's going on.
Careful, whoa. First of all, it's not like I think that's going to help the Eagles win.
If by lately you mean the last twelve years, yeah.
Duh- Wait. I just feel weird. I should just call him.
Shuckin��� the peas. ��You should go back to the first part, though. You are ��gonna ��cover for me?
Ok, you know what, uh, how much is that?
[on phone] All right, I will fax over it to you. Whoop. I will fax it over to you. Okay. Thank you. [chuckles]
Forget it. I was just about to brag but forget it.
No shame in that. Get it all out in the open.
Wait, wait, where you going? I mean, even if you don't hire a band, you still have to watch the bands. Pam, these are people who have never given up on their dreams. I have great respect for that. And, yes, they're all probably very bad and that will make me feel better about not having dreams.
[at company picnic] All right, you ready for this?
Today's a big day.  Today's the day that I show Pam the house that I bought for us. Without telling her. But it's my parent's house, the house I grew up in and yeah, I bought it kind of impulsively. I mean, the price was good and I was helping out my mom.  It's got shag carpets.  I mean you can't blame my parents it was the 70's.  And why would you want to buy ugly wood from trees when you can have paneling? And a painting of some creepy clowns that is apparently crucial to the structural integrity of the building. [tugs and pulls in vain at the clown painting]  She's gonna love it.  Right?
Could be. But you also called her the second time so you had the number right.
Oh it's tough being here for a lot of reasons.
Story's kinda bland.  It's about this guy named Dumbledore Calrissian who needs to return the ring back to Mordor.
Nope. I didn't, but let's go inside and I can call him right now.
[long pause and then he sighs and nods] Yes.
That's very interesting. Um, I feel like there might be a conflict there, and if a conflict did arise, how would that be dealt with?
I think this is really gonna help. If you could just hold up here one second. [addresses the whole office] Hey, guys. Quick announcement. If I could just have everyone's attention. [turns back to Ryan] I just figured you needed a place where you can concentrate and not be bothered by bothering people.
It's Kurt.  Wow, I am so sad that I know that.
Oh. It's your go-to therm. Oh, man. That's a bummer. I'm sorry about that.
All right, you know what? You're just trying to get rid of our best player.
Well, that is... because you didn't realize that... I was left-handed.
Oh my God. We're going to have to re-name it then aren't we? [Dwight's phone rings. He crawls into nook under Jim's Quad-Desk]
OK. 'Cause the quote was, cut off your nose to spiderface.
When I think of it like that, I do not think of the other connotations.
This shouldn't be coming from his boss. And we should also consider the fact that that man has an anger issue.
Yeah. Can I see it when I get back?
What are you gonna do about it? There's no shotgun, so... free at last, free at last!
We are here today, not to immortalize a man, but an idea... Maybe the idea of a man.
Go on and fool me. Love me, love me, say that you love me
I bet I should. [takes cell phone photo] That's beautiful, I'm going to email that to you.
Okay, ladies and gentlemen, Welcome.  I know you're all very excited, but no matter who gets this, I just want to say that you are all employees of the monthin my eyes.  And the winner is, employee number nine.  And that is?
Um... I don't... Uh, yes, that time that it was very late. Uh, we'd had sex so many times already, I was exhausted...
[enters breakroom] Hey. Sorry about Dwight, by the way.
[on the phone] Thank you. [hangs up the phone] The police are on it. They say they've already had three calls.
You know what, just think about it, you'll be fine.
Stressed, but to be fair, it was a tense situation.
No, not at all. In fact, I'm not even taking it seriously. I think at the end of the day, I'm just gonna pick a name out of the hat.
OK. Or maybe I could finish the coffee that's in here and you could use [finds a mug] uh, oh -- Snoopy.
Listen, this isn't a favor, all right?  This is a good idea. We all win.
Uh, man, by the end I guess it was about... ten...
[talking on cellphone] Hey! Where you at, Filippelli?
When Michael told us that Jan was pregnant, he led us all to believe that he was the father... by telling us he was the father.  But then we got this e-mail from Jan.  [waves paper and reads from it] 'Hi, everyone!  Jan here, writing to share some wonderful news and to quash a rumor.  First, the great news - I am expecting.  The beautiful baby inside me will be ready to meet the world this fall just a few months before the launch of the new Serenity by Jan line (shameless plug, I know, don't hate me, LOL).  Anyway, I also wanted to clarify that the father is not anyone that you or I have ever met.  Remember, no matter how excited someone is about my baby, it does not make them the father.  Best, Jan.  P.S. Hope to ship you something soon.'
Yeah. She's really funny, and she's warm. And she's just... well, anyway.
As ranking number two, I am starting a committee to determine the validity of the two committees and I am the sole member. The committee will act on this now.
Yes, we are supposed to look for every chance to acknowledge and appreciate each other's sacrifices. Because I need to appreciate what Pam's been doing to run the house while I'm in Philly.
No, don't worry about it.  We'll just got double or nothin'.
I always knew Pam has refused to go to sports games with Roy, but I never knew why.  Interesting.
What was I gonna- What was I gonna say?
Absolutely. 'Cause not everyone knows and some people may be offended.
I guess I thought you were approaching it with more of a sarcasm than misery. Kind of laughing at your own pain, sad clown thing.
Pam's doing great.  Uh, she's ten inches dilated now.  Uh, sorry, meters.  Centimeters.  And she's also fully faced.  Which I don't know what that is, uh, but no baby yet.  It's only been six, uh, nineteen hours, and uh, I just went out for some ice chips because I might have passed out a little bit, but these are very refreshing, very good.
Why don't we take a quick ten second break from that so I can show you what's going on here. [pulls up Dwight's game] Okay, this is Dwight's Second Life. He's on it all the time. So much so that his little guy here has created his own world. It's called Second Second Life, for those people who want to be removed even further from reality.
Well, he's not, though. So you just gotta suck it up. You just gotta move on. Try to have some fun. Come to my poker game tonight.
Please stop. People are having a Christmas party.
[turning around to Karen] Wait, are we playing teams?
What can I say, Dwight, I live a very dangerous life.
And you know what? I even made fun of you when you dressed up as Willy Wonka to pitch this idea and for that I apologize.
OK, I'm gonna go into this office here [gets up and walks into Michael's office] to do some work. So I will be in here.
Well, there's a $20 limit, right? So .. ?
[to Pam] ...so I talked to the scout, it looks good.
[to Cece] Hi. [to everyone] All right. Travel safe, Angela.
Psst. You think this thing's gonna go much longer?
Good. Cause I have a lot of questions.
Michael, it's Phyllis. We want Phyllis as Santa.
I really heard him on that. This one's interesting I'm not really sure what he meant by this. Um, 'Dwight Schrute Privates.' Tough to say.
Oh yeah, how long's this meeting going to last?  [Stanley mumbles, looking at his watch]
The salesmen have a commission cap, but we figured out a way around it.
If this job is in a well, I don't want it.
Uhh, a little bit. It's a lot of pressure, you know, but that's what I signed up for right?
[brings Michael into his office] So I've been meaning to tell ya, I wanna take you out for lunch. For your last day.
OK, OK. I have something that totally tops the box.
I'm sorry to hear about that. Who is this about?
Right. You're right. So maybe it was me who did it...by accident.
So, you used to share that cubicle with Kelly, right?
I think it's great that the company's making a commercial because not very many people have heard of us. I mean, when I tell people that I work at Dunder Mifflin, they think that we sell mufflers, or muffins, or mittens, or... And frankly all of those sound better than paper, so I let it slide.
[glances at Pam] Moms, primarily. Yep. Soccer moms. Single moms. NASCAR moms. Any type of moms, really.
[sings Olympic theme song] This scented candle ...andle ...andle. Which I found in the men's bathroom ...room ...room. Represents the eternal burning of competition. Or something.
Oh, ah, no but no. You know what let's go out. That was a good idea.  Let's go out.
Once a year Dwight holds a seminar updating us on the newest developments in the world of karate... because as we all know, the one thing thousand year martial arts do all the time is change.
Yeah, it's no big deal, just something that looks like that. [shows Darryl a resume] Cool? [goes to put the resume away]
Wow. I tell you what, it's really strong. I can't wait to read the rest of it later and see how it ends.
I thought it was great, sweetie. I would just fix that one --
I know. I just think it seems smart to keep the salesmen happy right now. 'Course I know that this might come off as biased, so you know what? Let us...
Would you write down your e-mail because I have just so many questions...
Alright. Then we're back to cash. And I got to say, if giving a small percentage of our commissions is going to smooth all this over, I'm for it.
Oh, no cause... you're gonna let me know when we're close, right?
Look, there was a big mistake obviously, so I will fix it.  Okay?  This was your idea anyway.
[Jim's phone goes to voicemail] This is Jim Halpert, leave a message.
Hey, do you guys have any other games?
[entire office is chatting] I'm saying, all I'm saying is Kevin is not necessarily a feminist, is all I'm saying.
[grabs Pam by the arm] Can I talk to you for a second?
Remember that time that I helped you do your laundry and that crazy guy came in and started yelling at you?
Oh, great. [reads] 'Glad they didn't mix up your tonsillectomy with a moustachectomy.' Oh that's not good.
So, how was the resort?  Did you ski a lot?
Yup, Phyllis called me Michael. And I will always and forever be haunted by that fact.
Yeah, that's what I had for breakfast and I think that's probably why I'm still hungry.
[to Kevin] Why don't you just go out on a date with her? Try to spark up an on going joke and then in a month or two, if it feels right, you'll know.
I've spent so much of my life telling myself 'Please, don't end up like Stanley,' and now I'm wondering if I even have what it takes.
All right, so I'll finish up on bulk pricing, and then you go into delivery guarantee.
Do you mean, like break-in in the middle of the night and change the numbers on payroll?
Okay, wait, I was not... I did not-
Yeah. All right. Bye. [Kevin sinks putt] All right. Sorry, I got to annoy you one more time. What if I bring down shipping costs?
This is not an excuse to blow off work doing carnival-like activities. Sure, every participant will be getting a corndog, but that���s for fueling only. No savoring.
I will get back to the rundown, uh, right now.
Yeah, sure, but... who's been saying all that stuff?
Uh, everyone? Everyone, can I just have your attention? Has anyone seen a small-[pointing to Angela] Stop that tiny blonde woman! She stole my baby!
[outside] So I'm still in the process of converting the garage.  It's got great light in here and I'm thinking, it could be perfect [opens garage door] for an art studio.  [Pam looks around and then looks at him] Look, I know, I bought this without asking you and it's doesn't look great, I know that.  And if you really hate it, I totally understand it's just---
We have one question to ask the spirit world and you want us to ask that?
You know what? I think you just need to meet him.
[Robert leaves the conference room and looks at the others in the office as he grins at the camera and leaves] He creeps me out. [Toby nods] But, I think he might be a genius.
Yeah I think we have complimentary strengths. We understand each other.
Oh, shouldn't we ... I bought that specifically for Pam.
Hey Pam, will you wait for me one second while I tie my shoe?
Alright guys. You know how we all like the red licorice but it's always buried behind like a ton of black licorice? [points to pile of candy] Bought it all. Now it's like red city in there. So, enjoy it.
Do you want to go play on the table upstairs?
[as Andy and Kevin shout 'yeah!' in response to Michael] Okay, I feel like this noise is going to prevent Pam from being able to listen to her body's signals.
You see that?  I'm pretty sure she's...  Hi.
I'm going. I'm a little nervous to run into Dwight on his connecting flight to Mordor. But, other than that... um, yeah, I bought the ticket, non-refundable.
We still doing the gifts today? [Pam nods] I mean, it is the Christmas party. Well, the classy Christmas party.
[interrupting] Alright. Well, enjoy the red licorice, and good riddance, right? [tosses black licorice into trash]
Stanley. Just played Dunder Ball with Toby. What about you, you got any games?
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa. [Michael skates by]
Party looks fun doesn���t it?  Everybody seems to be in there having a great time.  So maybe now would be a great time for me to pop back on the computer.
You're the boss. Don't you think we'd all be a lot more productive if while we were doing work we looked up and saw the best rural pie stand in Pennsylvania?
[goes to hand Dwight a valentines card] Wait.
Yeah, I didn't think I had.  Well, it was all about Pam.
Because of the sign, that says no pounding no begging.
So what is going on, girl in the computer?
Oh, [clearing throat, deeper voice] Sorry, I uh... was just saying that we should uh...
Okay, so close call at second. Was there an infield fly?
That's it. I think we should do it the Lethal Weapon way.
You���re not serious, are you? You didn���t get any of the recital?
I don't know.  Feel like... Friday night crowds...
I found Dwight's wallet in the parking lot.
All right, not bad at all. I think we can beat 20 minutes though so let's try again. Get it all out now if you have to.
No. Not too hard. Not harder than I should.
But if not, there's always the army. The infantry.
[on the phone] Hey, where are you? Oh good. Yeah. We're just here, we're playing Desert Island. It's when you pick your five favorite DVDs...
[while Dwight and Kelly are arguing] Guys guys guys guys guys guys. We just want to make it up to you. What can we do?
OK, but what if I told you all the money you spend here, goes to preventing a disease that's already been cured.
Um, you know what, I actually didn���t handle that move, uh, very gracefully. From not communicating to being a little selfish.
So, it turns out it's the closest place to get a marriage license without a 3 day waiting period.
OK, so there's no defense for that, good to know.
[Carol walks through door looking upset] [waves] Carol.
[seeing Dwight wearing sunglasses and whose face and hands are completely covered in gauze] Oh, I know this guy. [Dwight awkwardly hands copies of his resume to the Search Committee] Hello! Mr. 'Soo-ven-yay.' Mr. 'Jacques Soo-ven-yay.' Nice to meet you. It says here you're French. [Dwight nods] So you worked at your last job for 15 years as Assistant to the Regional Manager.
Okay. You had some fun, and uh, I think I paid for it. So let me get my last shot in there. Is there anything you can do for me?
Uh, I actually thought we were keeping it pretty low-key.
Okay! First of all, stop using my name.  And second of all-
Hey, Andy. You know I've been thinkin about what you said-
[Irish accent] Angela's Ashes, top o' the morning to us.  Frankie's prose is funnier than a pot of gold, say I.
[dancing with Pam. They kiss] See, now you don���t owe me anything.
I've never been a kiss up. I - it's just not how I operate. I mean, I've always subscribed to the idea that if you really want to impress your boss, you go in there and you do mediocre work. Half-heartedly.
I don���t know how else to tell you, okay? I���m doing everything I can every week to bring home something...
I can't believe I'm saying this, but Michael is actually killing it with Holly. And I think I know why. It's because Holly is kind of a major dork.
Well, I don't know about the rest of you but I'm just gonna say it. I'm nervous. I have no idea what health problems this is all gonna cause. [group agrees, protests]
I can always kind of win at roulette.
[front door slams, Kelly walks by] Hey, Kelly.
There you go. There's plenty of base-laying left, right?... Hey. Hey!
Ah.  That... they might be off the hook for because I... didn't tell them.
Threat Level: Midnight is the great lost film of Michael Scott.
I am off to New York. My brother Pete from Boston, and my brother Tom from New Jersey are taking Pam and I out for lunch, to celebrate the engagement. Or maybe to beat me up. I can never tell with those two.
Yeah. We should be able to have that right over to you by Monday. Yeah no problem. [Reveal Jim behind Quad-Desk] Thank you.
[Jim and Dwight sitting next to each other in talking head interview] Go ahead.
You know, the more I think about it, the more I think we should give it to the salesmen.
You should actually thank Erin, she's the one who agreed to babysit.
What happened to me this summer? Dwight bought the building, so actually, this has been the busiest summer of my life.
And what if he comes at you with the other hand, because he does have two.
Uh, what happened to that video I sent you?
Ah, well I think I'm gonna see Katy.
David Wallace has asked me to come down here and see if you would be interested in Dunder Mifflin buying you out.
Don't. [quietly] I have information about the sex predator.
How about this-- You let me take you to lunch, and I make my case?
[he office shushes Michael to hear the movie better] That's fine, it's great!
Ah, we're gonna go tonight, but we're gonna see you there tomorrow morning, right?
It's a complete... well, actually it's exactly what you'd expect, so... How are the girls?
[Jim and Pam head out the door and there are policemen at the door] Of course
Mmhmm, yeah, last time I was there I had a lot of fun.
Alright, Well if I see a gas station, I'll pull over.
And I was still just a paper salesman.
Okay, crazy.  I think I have some better things to do with my day than worry about you, like sell printers.
Oh man, it's gotta be over a hundred thousand dollars.
[Gets up and looks out Nellie���s office window] He���s running!
Today I will be asking David Wallace if I can start working part-time, because the sports marketing company that I started really needs me to be there.
I mean, do you like it? You having fun? [Andy snorts, unsure how to answer] Tell you this, everybody else is having a lot of fun���.and you did that.
Dwight and I are both writing letters to our clients. I'm just sending a quick note to say how much I appreciate their business, and he is writing notarized letters to inform them them that lying on customer reviews is a prosecutable form of fraud and defamation. It's just... different styles.
It didn���t have a buster sign around him?  Why don���t you draw him?  Why don���t we see this whole thing.
Oh, now I get what Pete was talking about at the sales meeting yesterday.
This guy was good. Although, he did keep saying that he needed two weeks off right at the beginning for a trip to the finger lakes. Seriously. Every five minutes, he was like, 'just making sure the finger lakes thing is clear.'
Yeah, alright Kev why don���t you come with us?
You did not force me to do this.
There are thirteen people working in this office, so thirteen times a year Michael gets a cake and balloons, and some sort of joke gift and makes a toast. There are two types of toasts. One is a joke about how old you are.
Well I think enemy's a strong word. 'Cause I think we have a really charming back and forth. And-
Every time there's a silence, your brain's like 'Heh-heh-huh-huh' [imitating crying].
I don���t even know where the stairs are!
We should help him out. [Jim and Pam each take a French fry, eat it, and then look toward the bathroom]
I missed you. [they embrace and kiss as Andy watches on sadly]
Wait a minute. You said the tradition is for the groom is search for her and it ends at a pub. So how about the last pub you���d ever set foot in in this town?
I think all of us have a tendency to view celebrities as sort of mythical figures, you know? We don't really see them as real so therefore we don't judge them as real people.
Well, it saves time, you know. 'Cause we could just meet in the parking lot every morning. Walk in together. Perfect.
He's an amazing man. He's a Rhodes Scholar. He invented an app that invents apps. Fantastic kisser...
Michael, I thought we discussed that we would rather you not speak, like, at all. Because it's just going to be blood relatives, I think.
I am leaving early today for Philly, because tomorrow is the first day of my new job. So I figure I'd get in at 5:00, check into a hotel at about 6:00 so I can get a real good night of restless sleep and nervous puking.
Nope. I think that was it. [Dwight gets up and walks away]
Fact.  Bears eat beets.  Bears.  Beets.  Battlestar Galactica.
Well... yes, that's probably what it is.  So what do I do?
Uh, actually, I haven't talked to her in a while.
Ahh... I got you some tiramisu. No hard feelings.
Kickoff. [to camera] My strategy is to touch the ball as little as possible. Chalk it up to teamwork. [to team] Alright! [clapping]
Um, everytime my sixth grade class has a field trip.
No. This is a fire cracker free wedding.
What's that? Oh, yeah, back then I did. Just now. So, don't, because I've got my eye on you.
Ha ha.  No, yeah, that will be good.
Pam never seemed to have a problem with us.
I just don't know if he's presidential enough.
Unfortunately, Jo also took the job away from you because she doesn't trust your judgment. So how would that look for me, if I recommended you?
[approaches Roy back at the wedding] There he is. Is it almost time to cut the pancake, or what?
I tried to keep Michael in the dark.  I should have known that he can do just as much damage in the dark.
Are you kidding? Thank you, man. I mean, I've wanted the opportunity to say thanks for... everything. And I'm really sorry about the job. That just seems crazy.
No, of course we're not tourists. We're just people that aren't from here who are taking a tour.
Andy, nobody really expects you to go through with this���
I seem to have sticky not emergency where I grab it on the wrong end, and this happens.
Pfft. So have I. Hey, question. If you had to spend a night in the Met or the Aquarium, which would it be?
Um, well, we are all getting excited to see this fight. The Albany branch is working right through lunch to prevent downsizing, but Michael, he decided to extend our lunch by an hour so we could all go down to the dojo and watch him fight Dwight. Fight... Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, I'm coming, fight...
I'm actually just looking for my Blackberry, so, carry on.
[holds mug next to Andy's head] Make the face. [Andy smiles] Yeah, I don't see it.
You know what? I would save the receptionist. I just wanted to clear that up.
Is that what you were here for? A crystal wizard? I like it.
Well, I'm going to the outlet mall on Saturday, so if you wanna save big on brand names and Roy has to work, which he will, because I'm also competitive, you should feel free to come along.
No, I didn't. I took back my chair that you took from me, but I didn't take your chair.
Totally, no problem.  What are you interviewing for, by the way, my assistant? Or...
And that's really sweet. And you can think that. But you don't say that out loud, and you definitely don't say it to her.
Oh. OK, well you know what, I um, just call me later.
Oh, great. So we���ll see somebody else���s kid with Cece in the background? I mean, it���s really not that hard to film a video.
Plus you have so much more to talk to this girl about, You're both um, salesmen. I mean that's something right there.
Good one? [Toby puts on the lens cover and scurries away awkwardly] That's a cool camera.
Oh no, this is different. The CIA thing, that was a prank on Dwight. This is more like a umm... OK, it's pretty much the same thing.
Because the fun part is, you get to decide on an hour of television, or an hour of napping.
Sorry, uh do we need to sign one, or...?
Yet here you are, back in a Laundromat.  Now, I'm just trying to help you, Beesly.  Be safe.
Do you remember what you said to me on my first day of work, just before you walked me over to my desk?
But the paint's chipping. Is that your old bike, Michael?
Take care of my wife. I will be back.
Are you sure you can keep this under wraps?
It���s Ryan. ���I���m sorry. I lied. I���m not in the bathroom. I can���t do it. I need to see my mom. I���m going home.���
Yes. We will be requiring a bed time story.
Yep.  A long time ago, but, I liked it.
Look, you guys are smart, so I'm just leveling with you. I'm just trying to treat you like adults.
Okay, DVDs. Five movies. What would you bring to the island? Toby, go ahead.
Why did I transfer to Stamford?  I think that's pretty obvious.  I got promoted!  And you can't beat that view... right?
That rhymes, so what have we on the docket today?
Okay, just wait one second, alright? I will copy it. Do you have a pen?
Hey, the Schwab guy told us to treat every sale like it was a huge sale.
Mmm. Hey, can you ignore those and do something for me instead?
Listen, you're the one who decided to leave. Come on, he's the new boss, you know we have to do this.
I'm sorry, I thought you were making a joke.
Yeah, it's not as fun if I'm not blowing off work.
I am not kidding. [shows camera an engagement ring] Got it a week after we started dating.
If it's the same thing, then why did you write 'workspace'?
Good!  Fine!  I've got one Andy Bernard that will direct this puppy for half your fee... [dialing phone]
What award would you like to give Dwight?
No, it's not 'ugh.' It is... office camaraderie.
Do you know the industry is in decline?
How about this one - 'When arrogant salesmen are mean to my face, a certain manager will go to his moppy place.'
[raises hand] Question. Won't that interfere with your other task forces?
I'm doing OK. Getting excited for the weekend though. What are you up to?
[demonstrating with napkin holder and salt shaker] So Phyllis, he was here, and then the car came and did- he was like that. Yeah, so it had to be a double backflip, actually.
Ooh, nog it. Let me get some nog. [Everyone talking Phyllis pours Jim some eggnog, as Daryl walks in] Thanks, Phyllis. Where's Andy?
Oh, that's my mistake, sorry about that. The last paper company you worked for burned to the ground? And all because they wouldn't hire a manager who lived and breathed paper? That's a travesty.
Uhh, she's still pricing the whatevers. The shredders.
And in this room here, if you look closely, you will find out a few clues about who lives here.  Um, he likes biking, obviously, and uh, what else?  Uh, he likes tour guides, I guess.  And if you're very perceptive, you'll notice that he didn't do a great job of cleaning his room [kicks water bottle under bed].  Ok, and uh, that's the tou-
You know what though, I've actually seen ads for nurses that you can hire by the hour, for parties and bachelor events.
Party planning is literally the stupidest thing I have ever done in my life.
All right, it will not happen again.  I promise.
I am extremely interested. So, how much will all of this cost?
Toby and Kevin, they're trying to get Angela kicked off.
Okay. Love you. We'll talk soon. [hangs up phone]
I did have a chance to think about it, but then I thought about something else.
Hey, Abby. I wanted to give you this for all your hard work today. Look. Michael signed it and everything. Official.
Check this out though, spin serve. [serves, and Dwight scores] Well, it works like 80% of the time, so...
Is Ryan gonna fire me?  I don't know.  I know that I've done everything I can, and I just brought in a huge sale, and... am I insane, or was this kid a temp two years ago?  Because in the three years that he's been here, I think all he's ever done is start a fire and grow a beard.  And it's not even a good beard.
And who cares?  It's a stupid veil, right?
OK. Dwight, I'm sorry, because I have always been your biggest flan.
It's going to be alright. We're a good company, we'll figure this out.  We're not going under.
OK, well I saw a station about a mile back so, chop chop.
OK, I'll ta...I'll talk to you later. [hangs up]  That was a good story.
That's it? That's all I get? Even after all the hard work I put into celebrating your talent today?
I think you need to go a little easy. You can't just suspend someone form work.
[looks bored. Taps finger on desk. Head falls to desk]
Okay, you know what, Dwight. What if you got a really serious disease like Ebola.
Correction. I do not want to sell you Professor Copperfield's Miracle Legumes.
No. That is just a bunch of people participating in a collective thing that maybe the Eagles will hear about and want to play better. It's not...
Hey guys, why don't we, uh, just cool off a bit?
Binghamton branch closed last night and their clients are up for grabs.
Look, Pam, I don���t know what to tell you. I mean, what do I do? It���s gone. That moment���s just gone. I missed it.
Oh, actually... uh, nope. That is my wife. Again, he���ll be calling in any second.
Hey, how you doing? Jim Halpert, sales. Just wanted to say, if you need anything, let me know.
Were going to head outside, give it a whirl. I just want to see how it works.
Okay, if it's all the same to you, I'm just going to take away 'Survival Skills' and 'Self-defense.'
Very nicely done. I think that's H-O-R for Stanley, and H-O for Phyllis.
You know Michael, this whole Donna thing is gonna be okay, you just... stop beating yourself up.
Well I think if you use the same jokes it just comes across as lazy.
Well, uh... I don't think any of us really know. Alright. [Jim hands Pam a present]
I don't know maybe being a good dad is just all in your own compass. I don't know, I don't know. Thank you!
OK, here's the deal. All right? Pam says that one of the alliances is meeting in the warehouse during Meredith's birthday.
[singing the intro to The Lion King's 'The Lion Sleeps Tonight'] A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh...
What about music?  Do you have any music?
Nah, I think it's mine. Lemme just check real quick, here. Alright.
You want to just make a run for it?
Yeah, I actually have to agree with Dwight on that one.
Pam, no!  Are you nuts?  We're going to the hospital now.
He brings up two good points.  Do you have any new leads? Any new territories you want us to look into? Maybe have an in with a big client that we can get our foot in the door?
Wait, wait, wait! Stop! Stop! Stop! Will you stop?! [Kelly and Erin screaming as Dwight bashes their heads together, everyone attacking each other and yelling]
Yeah, I mean she was with Roy, and, uh, I just couldn't take it.  I mean, I lost it Dwight.  I couldn't sleep, I couldn't concentrate on anything.  Even weird stuff, like food had no taste.  So my solution was to move away.  It was awful.  It was something that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy, and that includes you.
Do I think I'll be invited to the wedding? [scratches head]
Travel.  I've been looking forward to it.  It's gonna be... really nice.  Gonna find myself.
Um, actually it's, it's for your own good. I think maybe we should- [gestures toward hallway]
But you said that you went out with her this weekend.
[tackled by Dwight] What are you doing? No. No, no, no.
I've had a Foreman grill for about six years, I've done about 85% of my cooking on it, but I've never burnt myself, probably because I don't use it as a pillow.
I bought it.  It's ours.  Let's go inside, I'll show you inside.  [walking inside] So if you can believe it I did it without a realtor.  Saving on closing costs is good and, uh, we can put all the money to de-shag the carpet.  Which I think will help, the color situation. [Pam walks over to the clown painting on the wall]  Yeah, I am really sorry about this.  I tried to move it but he is really nailed in there.  Worried about art theft, I guess, lot of art theives in this neighborhood.  [upstairs] This is the master bedroom but, I'm actually not allowed in here so... [shuts the door]
Is this about the popcorn? Or the X on the ceiling? Dwight, that was a prank.
Oh, right. I remember that one. She read it to me. She said she's not really ready to date somebody in the office, but she really likes you as a friend.
Things are a little delicate with me and Pam right now. And if my working in Philly is gonna end up doubling the Dwight in her life, that���s only gonna make things worse.
Dwight, come on. Don���t end on a bad note.
Look, is there a birthday you remember that you loved?
Michael, I like the sound of your voice. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to buy one million dollars worth of paper products today.
Do you think I'm calling you for your best approximation?
I just think that maybe they're eating large amounts of the day.
You good?  I'm just checking on the other branches.  Michael wants me to do that from time to time, so...
Sorry, just to be clear, you're saying do NOT shake the baby.
No, no, it's okay, I'll be right back.
Not important.  Because you're not dating her.  Because it's a felony.
[Dwight falls onto the couch] Stop, stop, stop, stop.
Ok. Well, hey, you're not here. You don't know, Ok? It's intense. They made me eat black licorice.
Hey, would you mind coming out here for a second? I just have something for you.
It���s insane. This huge investor got cold feet, so I���m stuck here trying to keep him on board.
So, you just couldn't take it anymore, huh?
Oh my goodness, let's take a look at these. They're usually amazing, so let's see. Yup, they are. Uncle Andy.
Prank! [throws money from Dwight���s wallet on the floor]
Yeah, well. Yeah, OK. Well, then thank you. Thanks to both of you.
[laughing]  Um, you know what?  I.. should have just had... I should have just had you call me on my cell.
Uh, no, actually. That was in Robert���s notebook.
[on phone] Please don't pick up, please don't pick up, please don't pick up.
Oh wow, that sounds like fun. Is your friend named Karen too?  What did she accomplish?
[looks in  the refrigerator] Hey Dwight, my tuna sandwich isn't in the refrigerator. You wouldn't know anything about that would you?
Say what you will about Michael Scott, but he would never do that.
[to babysitter] So... how do you guys know each other?
Well, the car seat was to take her to the hospital, or...
Wow! That is really hard. You really think you can go all day long? Well, you always left me satisfied and smiling, so...
Basically after Phyllis blackmailed Angela, Michael asked them to both step down from the party planning committee cause there was too much drama.
Okay, shhhh stop... stop whatever you're doing because this is going to be good.
So, where did you learn how to play?
That's not really true. There's a lot of things you can do with an art degree actually.
And we would love to have you. But not today. Unfortunately, it's a bad day, what with Operation Overthrow and everything, but I have noted it.  [Dwight tears the sign down, Jim hangs two signs in its place]
Today is Thursday.  But Dwight thinks that it's Friday.  And that's what I'll be working on this afternoon.
Because we're strong, Dwight. Because we're strong. God, it's freezing, I gotta go in. You stay though for like five minutes.
Yeah. As a child, did Pam show any traits that would hint towards her future career as a receptionist?
Okay, it���s not that Pam. You know, I was thinking it reminds me of those lists Dwight used to make.
So he's kind of like santa, except dirty and worse.
I don't know about Stephen King, I mean...
God, this is so sad. This is the smallest amount of power I've ever seen go to someone's head. Phyllis, can you believe this?
Am I the only one that���s nervous? How are you doing with this? Should we have bailed?
Toby and I used to sit together until Michael moved us because he thought we talked too much.
You know what?  Let's just leave that image out of it, because this is a happy place.  Happy thoughts, Pam.  Happy thoughts.
I didn't think you were going to get that one. I really didn't.
[reading from computer] ���Side effects of EMF include: headaches...���
Okay, you know what? Why don't you take my hand, and leave them, and let's get out of here.
You'll never guess, I just got a message from my landlord apparently, my apartment flooded, something with a sprinkler. Pam, we should probably get going and see the damage.
It's true. I'm having a party.  I've got three cases of imported beer, a karaoke machine, and I didn't invite Michael.  So three ingredients for a great party.  And it's nothing personal, I just think that if he were there, people wouldn't be able to relax, and you know, have fun, and my roommate wants to meet everybody.  Because I'm pretty sure he thinks that I'm making Dwight up.  [sighs]  He is very real.
Well, take your worst fear and multiply it by infinity.
Weeks. Always weeks. Man, the last time I talked months was like, a million weeks ago.
And I gotta say, this was a tough decision. And we had to go with none of you.
Oscar, what do you wanna do, this is kinda your deal. You wanna dog?
[Dressed as Dwight] It's kind of blurry. [puts on his glasses] That's better. [exhales] Question.  What kind of bear is best?
[Dwight walks back to his desk] 19 minutes and 48 seconds.  What were we doing for 19 minutes and 48 seconds?
Darryl, it doesn���t matter. I think you know the point I'm trying to make.
I didn't think you'd notice. [laughs nervously] Uh, it's funny actually, there's another salesman out here, Dwight Schrute, and he sent out this memo, as he always does, and, uh, it was about professionalism in the workplace. Of course, he singled me out. So I just had to mess with him.
I can't say whether Dunder Mifflin paper is less flammable, sir, but I can assure that it is certainly not more flammable.
Pam gets a little down.  Her toaster oven broke. Um, which she got at her engagement shower. Um, for a wedding that still has yet to be set... and that was three years ago.
Hmm, that logic's air-tight, but unfortunately it wasn't conceived here.  Burning man, port-o-potty.
Could it be that Agent Michael Scarn has finally found his Catherine Zeta?
I'm sorry, I feel like maybe I'm-I'm I misread things. Okay, let's just go back to watching.
He���s got a bank vault. That���s a start.
Hey, come on.  Let's go to the hospital.
[ignoring Darryl's question] So I think all we need is a resume, and we'll be good right?
Oh, my god! It was the theme song to Boy Meets World.
What if she's just flirting with you to get a better price?
I... I didn't know that Toby was gonna write it down. [the camera flashes] I was just venting.
Truthfully, it wasn't the way he fell in. It was... how long it took him to get out.
Thank you, Mr. Schnoot. [closes his binder] We will let you know.
Ah, good. Good luck. Doing good. [goes to the index cards and writes another race down]
Dwight has been acting manager for three months now. No. A week. Just feels like three months. Let's see, we all have to punch in to a time clock, which is very old, very strong, and has a slot about the size of a finger. [Jim puts a pencil into the time clock and pulls it out broken in half] We were all given new business cards big enough to set us apart from the competition, which is how I learned that our titles are all now Junior Employee. Our lunch breaks are staggered to prevent wasting time. Mine's at 10:30, and I find that the first hour of the day goes by a lot quicker than the second seven hours.
Yes! That, that, that! We're definitely doing that. Are we all in agreement?
I worked in Scranton for a really long time. And uh, it's going to be weird that it's all disappearing. I mean, I always knew that the branch would shut down someday. I just figured it would be because Michael sold the building for some magic beans.
Thank you, sir. [Tips his glass to Daryl]
Pam, I'm not gonna tell you. Hate to break it to you, but that's not how that works.
Okay, as far as dinner tonight, cancel that, and please, for both our sakes, never, ever, ever see her again.
Are you kidding me?  We've been driving around with this stuff in the trunk the whole time?
Really? Do it. I am a big, stupid goofball.
Maybe there's a vibe out there, with certain members of the office, that you are...a little sexist, or --
You can't yell out 'I need this, I need this' as you pin down an employee on your lap!
You know, I just think you should know that-
Alright, I���m gonna go warm up the car.
[using black voice] Good afternoon! [Darryl smacks his arm]
Oh no, I'm serious. I was thinking, 'For this trip I have to do something epic, so what should that be?' and then I thought of it. I'll poison you. What are you gonna do? You gonna steal my newspaper or put a cricket in my cereal or something?
Well, Andy has a mug just like that.
That is... quite the rap sheet, Prison Mike.
I really felt like I almost lost her, and���and nothing is worth that.
Okay, Dwight, come on. [to old man] You can go first.
Definitely. Yes. Glad you said that. ...You don't want to help me with some of my sales, do you? 'Cause, I'm kind of swamped.
Who wants Phyllis as Santa? [most everyone raises their hand]
Two! You have a better chance, if you think Bob Vance.
Hey!  Just in time!  You wanna go on the group tour? We were just about to leave.
You guys obviously went through some tough times leading up to it.
I know, I know, I know. But Darryl and Kevin needed a third. They bought me this jersey. I said no. Kevin started crying. So, I am Chris Bosh.
They're legumes Dwight, and you're just gonna make fun of me, so why would I... You know what, this ends now. [crumples up beans, stomps on them, and throws them in a box]
That must have been extremely uncomfortable for your mom.
Go bag's in the car...  Keys, my keys, where's my keys?
No, no, no, definitely, definitely.  Yes.  Next weekend, then.  All right!  I love you, too.
Do we all have our copy of 'Threat Level: Midnight', by Michael Scott?
Well, it would have been. So unprofessional, Mrs. Halpert.
Are you kidding me? I can literally scalp tickets to this.
So... you're cool to just wait here for animal control?
Ok, thank you, gotta get back to work.
Oh, you know what we should probably preserve the batteries.
What I was saying is the genius of Air Jordan was not in the market saturation, it was in --
Okay, okay, you know, just sometimes you���re not the best with the phone.
I should leave. [pretends to get up] [they laugh]
Well, I do the best with what I've got. Let's go.
And Pam it was like three years ago so I am totally over it.
[to Hank who is closing the gate] Oh wait, wait, wait! Hold on, hold on. I just need to get through. Just real quick. Real quick, open... uh, okay. [runs]
We present to you for your comments and approval, Dwight K. Shrute.
Hey man, I never got a chance to thank you... for stopping Roy.  Thank you.
[changes channel during commercial, sports scores appear on screen.]
I gotta make an example out of him. Should I just fire him?
You mean today?  He stepped on a George Foremen grill and he burned his foot.
It is really funny, but you know that can be confusing at a christening because you are not the godfather.
Okay, seems like everybody has an opinion. So, who else? Anybody?
Oh, burn.  Burn on you... and a little bit on me, too. [they laugh]
[motions for her to follow him] Come on.
No. I never said he was on a bicycle. I just said I wasn't listening to you.
Why did I talk to Jan about transferring? Well, you know... I have no future here.
You know what, let me give you a call right back. I'm going to uh, find it and then I'll call you back, thanks.
Mine was actually a pretty boring case, so-
I'm in an office relationship. It's special. Um... she's nice. She's shy. She's actually here. You want to meet her? Hold on one second. Oh, my God! Put on a shirt! Put on a... . I told you that you'd be on camera. I'm sorry, she's European. No, I told you that you'd be on camera. Stop it.
Oh my God, that's her! That's her, go, go, go.
Sure, yeah. Do whatever you need to do.
I'll get you a napkin. Someone get napkins please!
[Jim slams lunchbag on table] I just totally blew a sales call.
That's weird, if it's not locked, why isn't it opening?
[Michael walks into the office, still a mess] Ahh, what happened to you?
Okay, stop. Forever stop that story. That's disgusting, and it doesn't count. So give me another one.
No, will not, I'm not going to tell anybody. This is between you and me.
Michael, I think you really want to talk to him.
Okay, hold on. Are you sure Mose isn���t going to show up?
And I spend hours thinking of ways to get back at him, but only in ways that could get me arrested. And then here he comes and he says 'No, Jim, here's a way.'
[sighs] Hey David, how would you like a guy who���s not here as much, gets paid the same amount of salary, and has bigger fish to fry in Philadelphia?
Dwight, you know what, just back up, okay, that's making me uncomfortable. This is sexual harassment, by the way. Oh my God! He's got a knife!
I think you mean the aid to Afghanistan.
It is, yeah. I mean I just don't know why I'm compromising if it's my fantasy. Cause in my fantasy it's Maine and you love it.
If this bad idea goes off and we all lose our jobs. Are you going to feel good about that?
How about this. Why don't you give us a part of the plan, and that way we know you have it.
Oh. Well. I feel that as someone who knows Pam only a little bit... enough. A good amount. Not the most, though. I would say that she is misunderstood and that maybe there's some stuff in her past that you guys don't know about that's a little messed up and probably makes her such a torture to work with.
Did I ever tell you why I left Scranton?
Okay, 'A,' Halbert. And, 'B,' I think a more appropriate statement would be, 'The 'Halberts' are hosting an intimate reception for their invited guests.'
Yes, I am brining my kids in to help me get out of this hole. And you all remember my beautiful wife, Pam.
[on voicemail] Hey, it's Jim.  Leave a message.
Well what if we can't do it quickly.
I'm going to be the prettiest girl in the ball.  Oh, how much?
Hey, you know what? I got you a cake.
Do you really have to do that right now?
Mm, hey driver. Why don���t you take us to 3030 Adams?
Um... Whoa. [picks up ringing phone][in managerial voice] Michael Scott here. Yes, I am regional manager of this orifice. Mmm hmm. Dwight Schrute is amazing. Yeah. No, he is actually the single greatest employee of his generation. Mm  hmm. You know what? I'm gonna tell you what. You hire Dwight K. Schrute, and if he does not meet, nay, exceed every one of your wildest expectations, well then, you can hold me, Michael Gary Scott, personally and financially responsible. Okay. Okay. Okay-kay-kay-kay-kay. Okay.
How would that work in well?  I just want to know.
All right. [to Pam] I should probably get back to work. Get back to work.
And I have started a business in Philadelphia. [Pam shrugs]
I can't wait to hear about it later. Do you want to come in at eight? And uh, don't eat because I'm ordering in.
I sold paper at this company for 12 years. My job was to speak to clients on the phone about quantities and types of copier paper. Even if I didn���t love every minute of it, everything I have, I owe to this job. This stupid���wonderful���boring���amazing job.
Nope.  Just... [Deangelo continues staring at him] Okay. [gets up and leaves office]
[Michael steals the ball] Yeah, Michael. Go Michael. [makes shot]
It's not like you guys had some long relationship right? Big painful breakup I don't know about?
Yeah, we had outside classes all the time and we never did anything.
Is that really how you want to get this job?
...I'm messing with Andy. I'm sending him to all the women in the office with... just... terrible information on how to get them to go out with him.
Dwight's room key. And... Dwight's room. What can I say? Old habits die hard.
It's the weirdest thing. Every time I cough, he folds.
Yeah! I know it sounds stupid, but nationals has always kinda been a dream of mine.
[reads demerit] 'Jim Halpert, tardiness.' Ugh. I love it already.
Yeah, cheese, or do we have other flavors?
So as it turns out, unless you're a young child or a prison inmate, you don't need anyone supervising you. People just come in and do their work on their schedule. Imagine that - people like us allowed to sell paper. Unsupervised. [Darryl, Phyllis, Stanley, and Oscar are working while Andy and Ryan play on a foosball table] And yet, somehow it works. It must be because the stakes are so high.
It's so scary how right the things you're saying are. And you're coming at it with almost no knowledge, so of course I trust your opinion on this.
We can just have one big fun party. Everybody's happy, nobody wastes their time.
No, I didn't. [Michael laughs] You know why?
When Michael told us that Jan was pregnant, he led us to believe that he was the father. By telling us that he was the father.
Niagara Falls used to be, like, a spiritual experience for people. They stayed in tents and it blew their minds. It's really kitchy now, which is a lot of fun.
I���m talking to him this afternoon, but don���t get your hopes up.
In Philly, so, that doesn���t really work for the family. Watch this guy make a billion dollars off my idea.
Oh.  Yeah well, I guess there's been a couple late nights. Karen and I have been up talking.
You know a ton of fourteen year old girls?
Hey guys let���s just all admit it. Ok? Dwight���s better than us. He had the guts to stop sitting. And he���s never, ever going to go back on it right?
No, I'm not going to tell my nine-months-pregnant wife that I find her replacement objectively attractive. Just like I���m not going to tell my two-year-old daughter that violent video games are objectively more fun. It's true, but it doesn't help anybody.
[on the phone] Mr. Decker, we didn't lose your sale today, did we? Excellent. OK. Let me just get your... what's that? No, we didn't close last time. I just need your... Oh. W-What code were you given? Oh, OK. That's actually another salesman here. I can redo it if you want to do that. Oh, he gave you a discount? No, I don't blame you.
Based on his nickname. Like it already. Let me guess, it's autobiographical.
Hey that's work, hold on. Hey Wade, did Cole Hamels call back or what? Great. Good.
Ok, he didn't fix it. The brightness level was all the way down.
Woah, woah, woah. Do you know what you just agreed to?
Karen and I had a long talk last night and the night before that and uh, every night, for the last five nights.
But you know I wouldn���t hire any of these all-stars.
Kismet? Yeah, right. Pam and I came up with excuses for every other weekend. You remember my two lap band surgeries, right? Neither do I? ���Guten Prank��� number one.
I'm just kidding. She told me about it.
Okay, the man's worked here for 25 years. How can none of us picture his face?
You should ask him. It���s a color you would never expect. [Dwight storms off] Too easy.
Are you sure it's stress? Because I did poison you.
Okay.  Sshh.  I know.  [hands the baby to Pam]
Okay, Scott, why don't you take your head out of the clouds and come back down to planet Earth so we can make a commercial.
This is way more than I make now.
[after Pam has another contraction]  That's seven minutes.  Here we go.  This is happening.  Come on.
There are other reasons to go to Ohio.
Well there is some bad news.  [accent] There has been another murder.
Oh my God!  Wait, this goes back two years.
No, I hear what you���re saying, and we will. The thing is, we gotta lock down this key demographic first. The rest will come, I promise. Just give me a couple weeks, alright?
Hey everybody! Just want to welcome you all to the premiere of the real Dunder Mifflin commercial, the Michael Scott director's cut. Hope you like it.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Ok. Yeah. We're not watchin' this.
[takes her hand] Hey.  You look just as I imagined you would.  Pam, you're so pretty.
No, no, no, seriously, I'll be in the back.
[after Pam checks her cell phone] What's going on?
Your love line- I'm just kidding. I can't see anything.
Man, I'm so sorry. When do you find out?
[starts a stopwatch as Dwight yawns, stops it when Dwight is done] Yawn.  Four seconds.
Yes, he did.  You know what was nice, nights swimming in Bayou bay.
Let me talk to you about a few of the other things we can offer. Namely, we know the tax season is coming up, so by April 1st we can have you fully stocked.
Hmm, no, the choice is actually yours. Are you sure you want to do this?
I have a surprise for you.  All right, ready?  Close your eyes and now [spins her around once] open your eyes.  Tadah!
There was one thing we were curious about, uh, your flexibility on things like Easter or Memorial Day, because we might want to change our days around a little bit.
Um... 'Fifty signs your priest might be Michael Jackson.'
I feel like a stranger in my own country.
[peering nervously through conference room window] Oh, I don't have anything to say. I'm just hiding from Dwight.
[on phone] Hey, Brenda.  This is, uh, Jim Halpert from the boat.  And I got your number from the corporate directory and, well, I was assuming that you probably gave it to them because you wanted me to ask you out, right?  Um, so gimme a call back.  You can get my number from said directory, um, or just check your e-mail 'cause I just sent you one.  Yikes.  Uh... give me a call back, I hope.  I'll talk to you later. Bye.
Whoa. How did you know that I was gonna���
The song is about losing your virginity next to a church, and guess what - she's been singing for the last twenty minutes!
Hey, Michael.  I just scheduled lunch with a client so I might be back a little late.
When you were in the office earlier talking to Wallace, did I come up at all?
Hey. I was just about to call you.
Pam's on vacation and she gets back tomorrow, so it'll be nice to see her.  It'll be nice, and, uh, she set a date for the wedding with Roy.  Uh... June.  Summer.  So, that'll be nice.  And that's that.
But you're comparing you and Luke to God and Jesus.
[louder] ���Buy me some peanuts and cracker jacks!���
Ok, well, you're the one who lost the desk.
Yeah. On the booze cruise I told Michael about some feelings I used to have for Pam. I had just broken up with Katy and had a couple drinks. And I confided in the world's worst confidant.
You couldn't have taken off all your clothes in the men's room?
[to Pam] Are you cool to just hang out?
Oh man, it was great. They were great.
Ok, I just asked that ques-, I don't know. I mean it seems like the door is huge, right? So you should be able to back the truck up to the paper.
Okay. Okay. [Dwight throws another snowball and laughs maniacally]
So you're taking over. You just gotta get her out of there as soon as you can.
All right. ��Thank you so much. Wow. Wow! And good night! [applause continues]
Can't believe his mom dressed him like that, that's the real tragedy.
[In Kitchen] We're thinking of collaborating with Mike Schmidt on some of his charity work.
Not great. You heckled Santa for an hour and a half.
There���s actually not a rule that says that.
So, I either get more involved, or I take a sick day... leaving Dwight in charge. Oh God.
Oh, yeah, I should, I should, I should probably go too.
[to Pam] Can you believe this? [pause] He was pretty talkative at breakfast.
Least I didn't leave you at a high school hockey game.
I think that was sconesy cider, noted baptism reception critic.
For the record, I fought this. Alright? And now, I'm not really sure what we do.
[In the parking lot, holding his side, walking to the taxi, Pam follows] Oh...what was that? Now I'm gonna be all whipped for my first day at work. God. [To taxi driver] One second. Oh...
No, no, see? This is what we're talking about. I mean, what was that accent? And last time I checked, you were drunk and now you're not drunk...
[explaining PowerPoint to Donna] So, yes, laser printers are more expensive. But they cost less to operate [knocking] So it's a tradeoff.
Yeah, hi. Is Mr. Decker around? Oh, well, could you just have him call me after lunch? Thank you.
I���m gonna need you to look at your hierarchy mobile. You���ve got a regional manager.
I'll text Pam. She's really good at this stuff.
Cool. Okay. I'm gonna go home and lie down, draw the shades... there's just so much sun in here... bye Dwight.
I'm gonna write you up for not working.
No, I told you to warn me at five minutes.
Oh man, I was supposed to tell Dwight something......C'mon, Jim. [shakes head] I got nothin'.
I can't reconnect with you right now. Hold on one second. [he hurls a snowball at Dwight with a lacrosse stick, misses, and shatters a window, everyone gasps] Excuse me. [clears throat]
[driving] I am going to see Pam. Because I feel like I should. [sighs]
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I just meant I wanted to pay to have fireworks at the party.
Yep.  No, I mean I really liked it.  I thought was uh, a fun read.
A year after that Recylcops really began to take shape.
Uh, you know what, I gotta hop off because my, uh, taxi is here to take me to the meeting.
Oh no, no, no. That's ok. [Jim shoves some snacks in his pocket as he gets out of limo] Um I'm sorry, is this the conference center?
You should stop this, [pulls away mayo and olives bowl] and you should call Dwight right now.
OK, listen, we need to assume that everyone in the office is forming an alliance and is therefore trying to get us kicked off.
[shoe falls while climbing ladder] Oh. Ow. Ow. Ow. [grunts] Creed. I was never here, all right?
[Dwight hands Jim a piece of paper] Oh, what's this?
No, see? Right there, that���s the problem with your method. ���Cause I still don���t know if you���re saying ���Sea World��� or ���see the world,��� and it���s taking a lot of time to explain it.
Okay guys, here we go! We'll see you!
I mean I can see how it would seem a bit like we uh... How it looks like um... I mean now a days you can edit anything, right? I mean you can edit anything to look like um... anything.
No way! What did I say? I said that they'd love those sketches. Congratulations!
I think I did a pretty good job.
[walks into his office and sees the mallard back on his desk] Dwight, you brought the mallard back.
Well, I know this sounds crazy, but how would King Arthur choose the next knight of his round table?
[interrupts Dwight trying to force feed Todd] Can I talk to you a second?
We definitely are.  At 3:00, right?  You said we could stay until 3:00?
And I don't support her choice to hit you.
[Philip is crying] I know, buddy, I know. Cece, you want to come? Want to come out?
We didn't, because we think it'd be better to do it together.
I'm pretty excited about today. I baby-sit Toby's daughter Sasha sometimes. So, she's the coolest kid. She has seen me play with dolls, though, so I don't know how cool she thinks I am.
I'm sorry what did you say? So wierd...
And then an older gentleman asked you 'Boxers or briefs?'
[coughs] I will raise. [Dwight sighs and folds his cards] Thanks.
That bread on your desk? I just picked it up. It's white hot.
The bat, I mean, I know I felt it bite me, but look. There's no mark. I feel so... tingly... so strangely powerful... [shrugs] Oh well.
[after tense pause] OK. Here ya go. [roughly hands Darryl his thermos]
I promise...d other people that I would be on my worst behavior. And I gave them my word, so...
Mmm... nope, we mostly just talked about cereal.
What? No, no, no! Come on! This is real!
Last week, I may have gone too far. I'll explain it quickly. Basically, I found out where he gets his clothes dry-cleaned. Custom ordered the same suit, made with tear-away Velcro. And... you can fill in the rest.
And then, I'm pretty sure he's gonna fire you for it.
But are you a hundred percent sure? I don't think any of us are.
He's not the Steve Nash. He's big though. He's kind of like...Scranton's Steve Nash.
Hey, Oscar, on these new expense reports, do we really have to go back to last quarter?
Yeah, or maybe we don't even need that.
No way! All right Pam. Congratulations. [high five]
So four years ago, when I was in Stamford, Connecticut, and dating someone else, Pam went on two dates with Danny. Which was obviously the greatest love story ever told, given how much people are walking on eggshells around us.
Oh today, we saw a junk yard dog attacking the bones of a rotisserie chicken.
Well, I like pretty women who have the appearance of intelligence.
Jan didn't come back for her car last night.
Yes! [as other costumed actors come in and join Andy in song]
Okay. Can we keep it on the early side, though? I got that thing in Scranton later.
[on cell phone] Great. Yeah, I'll see you next week. Thank you, and here is Karen Filipelli. Bye.
She's seven pounds, two ounces, eighteen inches.  Mother and daughter are doing great.
I may have told some people that.  I'm nervous.  I'm about to get married.
Dwight is... special. But, I don't believe that his talents are being used in this office. So Pam and I have put his resume on Monster.com, Google, Craig's List. We're really interested most in jobs that take Dwight out of state. Um, preferably Alaska... or India.
[Pam storms out of the break room] Hey...
I just think I should tell you that... I've sort of started seeing someone. And uh...
[on phone]Uh, I don't know, let me ask. [to Dwight] Uh, were you quilled?
[on phone] Yes, I'm calling from Dunder Mifflin. We have a very rabid porcupine in our office, someone should come pick it up.
OK, I don���t have my pocket code chart on me, right now, so.
Eck!... Oh! Also, it is Thursday, but Dwight thinks it's Friday.  So, keep that goin'.
I can't.  She's too strong.  She's, careful, though.  You don't want to break it.
Hypothetically, if I thought Pam was interested, then... No, it's totally hypothetical.
Yeah, I had just told you about the day that I met the Blue Angels. I figured you had to top it.
Okay, I can't find my keys!  I cannot find my keys!  Found 'em.  They're here.
Hey, quick question: Do you shower at night or in the morning? Cause I wanna shower when you're showering. Save some water.
Hey, hey, wow, wow. Listen man it's, you know what. It's not a big deal.
Why don't we play that alphabet game that you were talking about?
You know, that's probably not gonna last too long, you should go to a hospital and get a real cast.
Can you figure out how to upload Cece���s dance recital? I definitely could use a pick-me-up.
Andy, it's the last day of the quarter. We've already called all our clients, so making that much in a day is going to be tough.
Let me show you what I mean. [Jim opens the closet door to reveal a work station] Your new office. How great is that, right? For a job well done. Well, not done.
Yeah! Like that rock opera! You could always do that right?
So, uh, if you just take a look at this, and then that���ll print out���Hey. Meet your new desk mate.
Well, I could've died, so... I looked it up online afterwards.
[snaps back] No one cares. Who thinks that Hillary Swank is hot, raise your hand. [half of office raises hand] Okay, and who thinks Hillary Swank is not hot, raise your hand. [other half of office raises hand]
No no no it's ok. So, Cece is with daddy now. She's laughing and she's happy. And we are on our way to see Dr. Barbra.
[on the phone]and I���m back. How are you sir?....I think we can squeeze a couple more golf games in, right?
Absolutely. Yeah. [whispers] Call it off, Pam. Call it off, okay? It's way more complicated than you think. Cancel the magician. Trust me.
All right, nice meeting you, Ted. Take care.
Yep.  Yeah.  She's blind, is that a problem?
It was a little glass display case for his for his bobblehead.  That would have made us even, I think.  He saves my life, I get him a box for his desk toy.  Even Steven.
It's a killer new dance move. [re-enacts leaning back] Do you wanna talk in your office?
But at the same time she looks crazy and I do understand her reasoning.
This is the last time I'll ever see Dwight. It's a weird feeling, it's, um, what's the word? It's not, it's not bittersweet. It's uh... sweet. Yeah.
Hey, Mike.  Since Roy left I've been doing a lot more work, and I need a raise.
But if the company doesn't go under then we'll finally have all our contacts in one program.
I haven���t heard of it, obviously. But I���m out because I am significantly younger than you-
Yeah. Yes. Um, I'm just in this, like, stupid fight with Karen.
Dwight, I'm in charge when Michael's gone, and I need you to sit...
You're not leaving tomorrow. You're leaving today right?
No, it's not, because you don't really work here.
Now, this is the projection over three months?
OK. All right, put your dukes up, Beesly.
All depends on the conference room meeting itself. [phone chimes] Uh, okay.
Hey, dude, leave him alone. What are you doing?
Well, I promise you that has nothing to do with it.
You know Dwight, if you didn't want me to go the smart move would be to tell Andy that I actually am essential to the operation. That way I couldn't go.
Some events are so news worthy, so historic, that you have to stop everything to watch. Balloon Boy, Michael Jackson's funeral. Things that if you didn't see them live, you wouldn't really care that you didn't see them at all.
That'd be great, thank you. [Erin throws package, it hits Kathy. She thinks it was Jim who threw it]
Okay, you're gonna still have to play that bean. You know that.
Oh, that's gonna be great. Who's Chuck Close?
I had a little better reason to believe that... You're right. You're right. Well, you're not right, because Johnny Depp...
[on the phone]I can have it to you by the beginning of next week.  Alright? Thanks very much. [hangs up] Uh, Phyllis! Bracken Auto?
Believe it or not, Kevin, fire crackers are in the don't column.
That���s exactly what I was doing. Plop, what animal am I picturing?
Hey, has everyone heard a crazy rumor about themselves today?
No, no, I had to. Look, I needed to look like a team player, Pam.
Swear to God. [Pam shakes her head]. Aww this is great. I was actually gonna wait and tell you on your birthday, but this is much more fun.
I think I'll see you at the mall. Yeah.
Huh. Well, you know, you can���t have everything so you gotta ask yourself what makes you the happiest. You just go all in for what���s most important. That���s my new thing.
Oh, um... Are you really mad about this?
Alright, wait, little bit of backstory, she loves dogs. She calls them 'da-das'.
Hey. So now that we are dating, uh, we just wanted to know if we had to sign one of those 'we're dating' things for the company.
Well, you know, the first performance was a little off.  But I really think they hit their stride, in the second show.  Um, might even bring my parents tomorrow, to the matinee.
Wow, can we make it a different moment?
[as Dwight prepares to throw dirt in his face] I'm sure... I'm sure she's in a better place.
[laughs] I'm ok, I'm not, great, and um... [nods]
Just give me one second. I'm just gonna grab something to eat.
Dwight. If you could travel anywhere in the world where would you go?
That's a bummer. OK, then we need to...[steps outside office] Hey everybody. Hi, how you doing? Can I have your attention please?  'Cause we have to talk about this birthday thing.
Okay well, Andy, listen. It's okay if you don't feel totally settled. This is all very fresh.
Hey, so this isn���t matching up with this���and I���m not sure which one���s right. Can you just hunt down the original for me?
Where do I stand with Pam? Um... no idea. I mean, we're friends. Always have been friends. Um... .that is where we stand.
Oh my God, that's right. I read in People magazine that he was looking for a two-bedroom condo in Scranton.
Well, then I guess you���re ready for this. [gives her the Christmas card]
[gives Dwight a thumbs-up - mouths the word] Good.
[on phone] Hold on one sec. Hold on one sec, Tom, what's that? You found five golden tickets? And does it say limit one per customer? Nope, it doesn't.
I don't think I'm gonna miss being manager. You know how some people say they're not in it for the money? Well, with all due respect to this job, I think I'm definitely in it for the money. And quite honestly, the women.
Wow. This whole Philly thing has been so much fun that I may have lost sight of what really matters. I mean, having fun is not nearly as important as being good to the people who you really care about. I mean, that's just 'Roommates 101'.
Okay, what was this look? [Oscar does the look.]
I don't know. Where to begin? My ball.
I'm sorry. This is for a news audition?
Hey. It���s nothing. Alright? I���ll text you when we get there. Let you know what���s going on.
Alright Pam, alright [gives her hi-five]. Nice work!
No, Pete is not the new Jim. The only we have in common is that neither of us wants to sit on Meredith���s face.  And if that  makes him the new Jim, then every human being in the world is the new Jim.
Cause it's a big deal. I mean.. I knew Pam was gonna say yes but I was still scared.
Course, it's on every Thursday night, so how could I miss it?
Nope, not a prank. I think it���s time for you to bury the hatchet.
I just need some time. Just give me some time to make a decision.
You know, there's a glare from over here... oh wow, that's magnificent.
Yeah, that's what I'm saying. They're incredibly helpful, you're lucky to have them. I mean with them there, you probably won't even know I'm gone.
Okay, just to be clear, you're terrible at this and you are not equipped for espionage...
I'll do it. Wear a little flouncey skirt if you want, and...
Pam, are you really gonna listen to his stupid homemade test?
Another round, boys? Great. [Jim walks to the bar]
Yeah, I mean I personally am definitely on board for the giant check.
Well, if Pam says she won���t go, then���[chuckles] we���re gonna need a lot more than counseling. Hmph.
Five minutes actually.  I am a black belt in gift wrapping.
Okay, so what do you want to do?
No, I'd probably buy a big piece of land in Maine, build a house, work in town. Somewhere I could bike to or kayak to. I'd either bike to my job at the kayak shop or kayak to my job at the bike shop.
Yes. I have started to see Karen. It's very new, and... not really ready to talk about it openly yet, just because, I think, once the word gets out there, it might affect the way people behave around us or... I dunno. Just, not yet.
OK, first of all, they've mostly worked, so-
Wait, are you the patient or the doctor?
[waiting for Fred to continue] ...What is it?
Cons, Ryan.  He defrauded the company.  He has never made a sale.
I really don't know.  How you doing with all this?
He's good at his job.  And I like working for him.
Okay, you know what, next time, I'll let you get the cake and I get to scream at the birthday girl.
[cell phone rings] Excuse me, one second. Hi.
Maybe we should just wait and find out.
Oh.  He's going to kill himself, pretending to kill himself.
I mean, you were gonna do this without me?
She's wearing a onesie [holds out his cell phone, Oscar leans in but Kelly grabs his arm]
Either way, Dwight��� I can���t be there for you. I���m sorry.
Toby's great. He's great, but sometimes he can be a little bit much. [in Toby voice] I don't see the harm in that. Well, it's a cake Toby, so, c'mon.
You���re the only one who can do it, s-sweetie.
My god, I���m so sorry. Well this might make up for it: I think I have found an enormous source of overlooked PFN.
Alright. [they stand up] Excuse me.[They sit down] I'm really sorry, but I have to let you go. And it's purely budgetary. It's not personal...
Because it is Halloween. So if you���re going to sing a concert, it���s a good idea to throw that one in.
Pam!  You don't think he'll mind if we take the shampoo, do you? [holds up large bottle]
Today, I am meeting a potential client on the golf course, because Ryan put me on probation. You remember Ryan, he was the temp here. Yeah. And uh, it is not a good time for me to lose my job. Since I have some pretty big long term plans in my personal life with Pam, that I'd like her parents to be psyched about. So I am about to do something very bold at this job that I've never done before. Try.
I bike to work now. Saves on gas, cheaper than a vasectomy and, uh, oh, yeah, it���s good for the environment too.
Why don't we just call the I.T. Guy who set it up? What's the name of the guy in Glasses, again?
[in women's bathroom] Well, I stand corrected. This is pretty cool.
Ok, I have a question. Why is the truck so far away?
No, I told you I don���t like that joke. It is a boy. We found out early.
It was, uh in the authentic design, right? So I mean, you really felt like Michael Jordan was wearing these shoes, so ...
Yes, and your mom got a very well deserved day off. So here's the thing though. I left Michael at the gas station on Benet.
Okay! Well this isn't my best, but call Froggy101, say that we're the tour manager for Justin Bieber, and we're giving away free tickets, we give him a number to call for the tickets, and it's his own number.
My mom thinks you're too dumb to hang out with.'
[Dwight pushes button for floor two] Dwight, what are you doing?
So apparently Pam went out last night, and accidentally called my work phone at 3:00 in the morning.
Ow, What are you doing? [Jim fights back]
And then tomorrow, I can tell you... what a great boss, you turned out to be. The best boss I ever had. [Jim is holding back tears too]
[inspecting the hole in the wall] Oh my God, that's half-inch drywall.
Later, Kev. [Puts French Onion Potato Chips on Pam's desk] Have a good weekend.
No, Pam, you're gonna lose him to another wedding.
Uh, yeah. I mean, as the strongest person in this office, I guess I should go down with you...
I mean, if we go in there and take these raises, what are we saying? That it's okay for someone to just take someone else's job? Shouldn't work like that.
[on phone] I'll take that down right now.
He can do the same for you. Right now. By getting fired instead of you. So what are you gonna do?
[sighs] Well, what does Roy think about everything?
Really? Hey, Stanley, what was the last thing Michael said before I came through the door?
What? [looks in box] Oh my god. Where did you have time to make that?
[shakes Michael's hand] Thank you. [Dwight looks disappointed and angry behind them]
Wow. I thought you were good at Flash.
Wow, we're having a little girl.  Oh, man.
No he doesn't.  You just get so nervous and hyper around him.
Chapter 2 ��� Announcing guests as they enter is the height of decorum. The more volume displayed, the more honor is bestowed upon everyone present.
Let me just see that one more time. Yep, you know what? I know who my friends are, now. But I shouldn't have got you involved because the truth is, I don't even really care about this picture, it���s a little out of focus. It was probably an accident, right? Like...
And I got to take this bad attitude, and I got to go home, and I got to adjust it. And I hope the suspension does that.
That's impossible, cause that's a brand new bag...[looks up to ceiling where there is a red tape X over Dwight's chair] Oh my god.
Great. Sounds awesome. Just have him pitch to you.
No, that was his wife, so he's on his way.
Ah. Why do you keep reading that garden party book? I mean, how hard are finger sandwiches and tea?
[Michael give Jim a 'World's Best Boss' mug] Thank you.
Quick question - do you play the guitar?
I don't have a ton of contact with the Scranton branch, but, before I left, I took a box of Dwight's stationery, so, from time to time, I send Dwight faxes. From himself. From the future. [reading fax] 'Dwight, at 8 A.M. today, someone poisons the coffee. Do not drink the coffee. More instructions will follow. Cordially, Future Dwight.'
Oh, Italian. Nice. Wow! You got the works there. Red onion, provolone...
Dwight, I really think someone's probably just playing a prank on you, so just go right through it.
Oh man, Ernesto's. That was our favorite restaurant too.
[in the stairwell on his phone] Right. And did you show them the market? Yeah. And what'd they say? That's awesome! That, oh my god! Wow!
I thought we agreed that we wouldn't do things like this.
Fifty percent of marriages end in divorce, so... it was her parents or my parents...
Careful...  Wow, she just shoves the nipple right in there.
Chapter 9 ��� The tableau vivant is not only welcomed, but expected entertainment at any garden party.
Anything. [Dwight begins to fill his new purse] Good. Yup.
Ah, let's do it. [laughs] Oh, that's healthy.
The KGB will wait for no one! [Michael laughs]
[walks in, see's Oscar, Stanley, Creed and Kelly sitting in Michaels office] Okay, I thought I saw people missing.
Good eye - it's an oval.  [Andy compares his arm length to his side of the conference table] You're measuring the table.
Okay guys, not every glance means something, alright? Life isn't Downton Abbey.
Dwight, it's not a factory at all. Do you have to do what you are doing? [Dwight is tapping each of the bobble heads on his desk and making them bobble]
No, we agreed, two percent for the quarter. Okay [others enter] Hey everybody!
This, man. I can���t do this to Pam.
Why wouldn't you see him?  You work for him.
God, give it up, Beesley. You know me too well.
Dwight, I didn't poison you. I was kidding.
Today we will be testing candidates for the position of assistant to the assistant to the regional manager.
[whispering] I don't even know who you are anymore.
At the Stamford branch, they all play this World War II video game called Call of Duty, and they're all really into it.  I'm told it started as a team building exercise.  Unfortunately I really suck at it.  We didn't play many video games in Scranton.  Instead we'd do stuff like, uh, Pam and I would sometimes hum the same high pitched note, and try to get Dwight to make an appointment with an ear doctor.  And uh, Pam called it... Pretendenitus.
Yes. Listen, you are spending way too much time talking to me, when you could be talking to her.
[Jan enters the office, pushing a stroller] Jan.
[Karen punches buttons on an ATM] Yeah, we went to the Spotted Pig for dinner. It's in the Village. Uh, Karen knew it. And then we second acted Spamalot. That's when you sneak in at intermission with all the smokers. And then we went to a bar that used to be a church. Oh and at this one bar, I swear I saw Lorne Michaels.
Well, you know, Wallace put me in charge, so you have no say.
Actually, you called me in here, but yeah.
Oh, please, it was my pleasure.  Well we all came, so...
Stanley just drank OJ out of my mug, and didn't seem to realize that it wasn't his hot coffee. So the question has to be asked, is there no limit to what he won't notice?
I'm not bossing you around. I'm trying to do my job, which is sharing your job, so maybe we should just call David Wallace.
That's the thing. See, I didn't want to get in the middle of this. Still don't. But here's something: I feel that maybe, if we take a step back, this is a simple case of anxiety to work with a spouse.
Yup, I do make great Christmas gifts. But I couldn't make that.
[starts chanting] Vol-de-mort, Vol-de-mort ...[Kevin and Karen follow] Vol-de-mort! Vol-de-mort! Vol-de-mort!
In the box. [hits it straight into the floor]
Well, you know how I like taking bribes. [both smile]
Uh, I can't get a handle on it. Am I cheap or rich? I can't...
Ok. Who else has heard the rumor that I am not as much in charge as Michael? [everyone raises there hands - including Pam]
Oh, that's because at first it was a made up position for Dwight, just to make him feel better, assistant to the regional manager. But then he lost that, and Michael gave it to me.
If it's alright, can I just have like one minute alone, just to go over --
He's trying to micro-co-manage me... or co-micro... manage... me.
Don't. Stop, Dwight! [Dwight pelts Jim with snowballs] Dwight, stop! Dwight, stop!
Nope. Social club. God, I hate when everybody calls us a rebellion. [Darryl enters and brandishes his fist, Jim returns the gesture]
Okay, just so I understand it, in your wildest fantasy you are in Hell and you are co-running a bed and breakfast with the devil?
It's a great idea Kev, I don't think it applies here though, so maybe we just-
Yeah, I mean it's inevitable. I definitely overhear some wedding preparation, but I'm fine with it. She hears me arranging my social life. And we both have to hear Dwight order deer urine over the Internet, so it evens out.
[shakes Michael's hand] I will see you, tomorrow at lunch.
I don't know that we need to dissect it all now, but-
Okay. Thanks. [hangs up phone] Animal control will be here at six.
Ok fine, three hints. One! When you are getting colder, you're really getting warmer.
Okay, that's insanely complicated and the first thing I'm going to do is erase it.
Could you please keep it down? [interrupted Dwight] I'm in session. I've determined that this committee is valid. [Pam and Karen cheer.]
No guys his name's not Hank, it's ah, is it Edgar?
You realize you're not actually talking to me, right?
[laughs] You're a good kid. You know what? It gets bigger once you're in there. Enjoy it. [shuts the door and walks to his office]
Hey. I just wanted to say that you woke up early with the kids and let me sleep and I really appreciate that.
Actually if I had fewer outside classes, I probably wouldn't be stuck here at a paper company.
[on the phone] So I just got the fax closing the sale, and uh, it's big. It is really big.
[sarcastically] Well, obviously. Too bad he's a temp and doesn't count, so let's get started. [starts to write on a piece of paper]
Now are you getting all your paper from PPC? Or-
What about a gift basket full of cash?
I'm just looking for my phone, so... pretend I'm not here.
I looked at you coming around, and I said, ���Wintergreen.���
Encourage him? I'm the victim, okay? He's fishing for me. We've got to do something.
Before me stands your coworker, Dwight Kurt Schrute. Dwight, show them all sides. Turn around. Now, today, we need your help turning Dwight into a gentleman.
And when was the last time Dwight and I agreed on anything ever? [clears throat]
Actually, when I was seven, my Dad took me to the Natural History Museum in New York. And we looked at fossils all day. And at the end of the day, he got me a little plastic triceratops. It was awesome.
Because most of the time, friends don't talk about other friends' butts.
Hey, just wanted to check in. See how you are doing.
What is going on? And where's Andy? And what is going on?
Okay, here's uh, this is very simple. 'Dwight's Workspace,' nice.
Michael's birthday. It's pretty fun to watch, actually. He gets very excited, and then he eats a lot of cake. And then he runs around the office. Then he has a sugar crash in the afternoon. And then he falls asleep. And that's when we get our work done.
Well, the group tour is now leaving, then.  Ladies and gentlemen, just a few things that we are gonna be pointing out to you today, you will be able to see both bedrooms and, uh, if we're lucky, maybe get a chance to peek into the bathroom, who knows.  I have to remind you that flash photography is prohibited and as much as you can, please refrain from touching things. I know you might want to.
Hold on, just wanna get it on camera. [holds up cellphone]
Right! [Jim laughs as he answers the phone] Hey, what's up? Everything ok?
Is that... I didn't know that was your... okay, so we're in agreement, this is not ideal... situation.
I'm just hiding out until all this stuff blows over.  With Creed. Playing chess. At work.  He's winning.  I feel like I'm describing a dream I had.
Come on, Michael says we should go now.
I'm very excited to see Brian. Brian's a great guy. And Pam and I have gotten really close to he and his wife, Alyssa over the years. And he got fired for protecting my wife from a jerk in the warehouse. I'm sorry, but you know him. He's a good guy.
Sorry, Gabe, but that show hasn't been on in many cookies.'
[cracking up at the stupidity of it, the rest of the office besides Michael and Holly are concealing their laughter. Pam Is trying to quiet Jim up] Sorry.
Okay, guys, guys, guys. That almost sounded like business, and we are trying to focus here today, okay?
Yeah, this is actually about the new sales guy. Uh, Dwight has brought in a bunch of real weirdos. And I was wondering if I could have some input���
[after entering daycare] Ok, this is officially the cutest thing I've ever seen. Cubbies. I totally forgot about cubbies.
Yes!  How are you going to cook every meal of the day in one kitchen?
Alright. So why don't you just give me my share of the leads, and I'll start making some calls?
Yeah, I mean, the Count has a very distinct voice.
Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I think ...it seemed like you were a little nervous.
Hey oh, listen, um, I told Michael on the booze cruise. It's so stupid. Um, I told Michael that I had had a crush on you when you first started here.
Ah! There's my popcorn. Can you just grab that for me?
Yeah. Yeah. It���s a good thing we talked about it though, because we had to...
[To Dwight] So it looks like this work bus was a pretty good idea after all, huh?
Come on. Get out there. Give the people what they want.
No way. I think she likes this stuff.
I started a new business with my college friend. But, Pam doesn���t know. Um��� actually I did tell Pam and we decided ���no���. But, then I decided 'yes' anyway. So, I���m thinking there���s another conversation coming. And, it���s hard to know when that will be.
Nope. Can���t accept that job. It���s not a real job.
[laughs] Just like now....too bad the schools are terrible.
Wow! You are a downer. We were having a pretty nice day.
It's a pretty good idea, don't you think?
Oh, Nellie. I'm so sorry. We were just...
[Pam approaches as he sits in his car]  Hey.
What?  I did not do that.  That sounds disgusting.
If you could help me out, that would be���
You are gonna crush it. Wow, I missed you.
[phone] Oh, hang on one second. Jim Halpert.
That's pretty funny. Hey you know what? Did I drop my, uh...
Yeah. I just feel like I got a bunch of stuff to do in Philly and I'm sure you have stuff to do. So we can just... I don't know, drop me at the bus station?
[on the phone] Yeah, she's with the nurse right now, so you'll have to stall a little longer... No, don't send in the subs yet... Dwight, I don't know. Think of something!
Doesn���t seem like anyone cares about us anyway.
Break me off a piece of that applesauce, I don't think...
Well, it's too late, because I'm proposing... that you get me a cup of coffee, which would energize me greatly, and make me the happiest man in the world.
Can I just say something?  I know that tempers are high, but I think the best way to handle this might be to just talk to Michael directly.
No, it's hilarious, you're right. I just think, um, 'world's longest engagement', um, we're all expecting it, you know?
Damn, lost another file. Going to have to reboot. Again. [Windows reboot sound] Hey, Dwight, do you want an Altoid?
You know I will. And by the way, seriously, we never, never do this!
Very expensive. Cause you say you want a small wedding and that's great but then you have to invite -
[snickers at Pam's sketch] That is pretty cool.
You know he's doing all this on purpose.
OK, whoa. 'Cause that is a pretty intense accusation. How do you know that they're fake?
Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go over there and I'm going to talk to him and I guarantee you he gives out his cell phone to everybody.
Dwight left his cell phone on his desk. So, naturally, I paired it to my headset.
Do you like going out at the end of the week for a drink?
This is a very good idea. This is good. Let's get all the bad ideas out now. Flush them out.
I just walked in on someone in the bathroom.
Dwight, is now a good time to go over what you expect of us?
Angela, it���s Halloween. You have to sing ���Monster Mash���.
Okay, so... three books on a desert island? Angela.
Pam made a drawing of Lloyd. He is a blend of all the salesman. [shows sketch]
Probably, probably. So I buy some, I turn the corner, I feel like an idiot, so I go back to get my money, he was gone.
Closed. [Michael leaves his office, gives Jim two thumbs up, which Jim returns]
Hey, Andy, I have some calls to make.
Can I just talk to you for one quick second?
I don't know, Dwight, I think maybe you should check again.
[office phone rings at Jim's desk] This is Dwight.
Hey! How are you man? Good to see... you.
Several times a day, Michael says words that are way beyond my vocabulary.
Um, I know that it involves spying on people and we may build a fort, underground.
Hey, um, I think you parked my car in. Is there any way you can move your van?
Hey, you're supposed to hit the white ball first, buddy. Nice one. Can I talk to you for a sec? All right. Everything ok?
Better theory. This is her ex-boyfriend and they went through some kind of painful breakup.
Good Lord! [Photo of Cece on Jim's desktop] I can't believe I'm missing this.
Wait a second. Last time I checked, Dunder Mifflin already has a website. And quite frankly, I'm not really sure what's wrong with it. [Jim at his desk, showing the Dunder Mifflin website reading 'Under Construction. Coming Christmas 2002!']
What was my worst first date?  Umm.  It was a couple of years ago.  It was a lunch date, actually, it was right down here, at Cugino's.  And we had just met, and we really hit it off, it was, it was kinda nice.  Umm, huh.  And, uh, then, as it turned out, it wasn't even a date, because she was actually in love with someone else.  So, best first date is also my worst first date.  Oddly enough.
It's like when he annoys me and I want to screw with him to get him back, he never sees it coming.  But now, I want to be nice to him, and actually give him something, and he's like an eel.  I just can't grab onto him.  It's infuriating.
But that doesn���t matter. This does. It���s the only thing that matters. We���ve had some really nice days together.
Oh, nothing. I just feel bad. I feel like things were a little weird today... or something.
My name is Jim Halpert and I am a sales rep, which is a very important job. Um, without me dozens literally dozens of small businesses would go paperless.  They would have to write on their hands, or bed sheets, or who knows you know. Total chaos, total chaos. I mean or they could get their paper somewhere else. Staples maybe. I don't know.
Pam and I are good buddies.  I'm sort of Pam's go-to guy for her problems. You know with stuff like work, or uh, her fiance Roy. Or uh... Nope, those are pretty much her only two problems.
Yeah, so we'll get right... You know what? I'll be right back. Stanley, you're taking over for me, buddy. I'll be right back.
OK.  You know what?  Here we go. [stands up] Uh, everybody?  I just want to make an announcement.  Pam and I are engaged.
Phew! Can't wait for this day to be over.
[in the kitchen] Oh, here's one. Did I ever tell you about the time that my brothers videotaped the lottery announcement? And bought the winning numbers the next day? And then, played the tape for me the next week, and I-
Oh, I didn���t know anybody called it- She likes it a lot- she, uh, loves Elmo.
He's still driving... Dwight, you forgot your bumper!
I need a decent bonus, because I'm actually in the process of buying my parents' house so that they can retire. And if history tells us anything, it's that you can't go wrong buying a house you can't afford. Pam doesn't know about the house, so it's... a fun surprise. [taps Bluetooth earpiece] Pam, sorry about that. I lost you for a second. So, as it turns out, I may not have done so hot on my customer reviews this year.
Oh my God, he's making you look like such a fool.
Uh, Wade actually has those on the road, but he���s gonna be calling in with those numbers any second. So just hold on one s--
Hey, I know what you're looking for, but um, I got to be honest, I really don't think I should be considered as your replacement.
Ooh, I like where this is going. Unfortunately I have a lot of work today so I���m gonna have to hand this off to my number two. But, don���t worry, he���s the best in the biz.
Hey, if there is someone out there who loves paper more than Dwight, I definitely don���t want to meet that person.
Whatever. It's not a big deal. You know I always tell my three year old, if this is the worst thing that's gonna happen...[Jim bites his lip again] You gotta be kidding me! Ok! Pam! That's it, I'm going home!
No. Not gonna do it right here, that would be rather lame.
Sorry, you're going to have to speak up a little bit louder. I'm hard of hearing.
Exactly that. I think that you absolutely deserve the manager position more than I do.
I did not love the dialogue. Or the character.  I took the role to impress a receptionist who will remain nameless.
The dawn goose walk will tug at your heartstrings.
[Opens folder and reads from Dwight's file] Last year, my boss, Michael Scott, took a day off because he said he had pneumonia, but really, he was leaving early to go to magic camp. Wow.
Well, I don't know about that. Just wasn't for me. But let me assure you, Dwight is firing on all cylinders. Right?
���Megan, I was too shy to tell you this when I was just a normal professional baseball player, but I love you.���
[picks up tape recorder and speaks into it] Dwight Schrute is now wearing a baby's bonnet.
Very nice. Very nice sales pitch for our clients that don't know what paper is.
What? What am I gonna do? I don���t ���
You should probably just meander back there; take a look.  See if he's, see if he's back.
Then why would you want to set me up with your daughter?
Dwight, you wrote that memo. Okay, it's not an official memo.
Are you inviting me to the Finer Things Club?
Would you like to pull a prank on Andy?
Okay, but we are leaving at five minutes apart.
Um, like stapler tennis or something like that.
Oh, Clark. I���m actually here today. Surprise! So I was wondering if I could maybe have my desk back.
[laughs] What's wrong? You didn't have a good first day?
So this is my life.  Until I win the lottery [laughs].  Or Pam finally writes that series of young adult books.
I wanted to talk to you about your divorce.
Finger Lakes guy is good. Darryl is also very good.
Well, either way. This is an amazing gift because it comes with bonus gifts. Look inside.
[both laugh] You know that I was doin' this.
[Pam and Jim watch video of their kiss on the tv] Oh, ah... No that's not... I mean that wasn't, ah...
You watching that commercial again? [Pam nods] Why do you keep watching it, if you know it���s just gonna make you cry?
You know what?  Let's go.  We got to go to the hospital.
I think you might be going a little crazy with this labeling thing, man. I mean, you put your name on a five pound bag of flour. Are you honestly saying that if I needed flour I couldn't use that?
I don���t know what to tell you, man.
Okay, okay, we gotta go. All right, we're going home, we're going home. We're going home, we're going home. I know, I know, bud.
What about if we did an even newer voicemail message that had even more zing and pep?
Oh no she just put it in front of my face.
Okay, I'm just gonna go get some ice.
No! You said that I'd be conducting the interview when I walked in here. Now exactly how much pot did you smoke?
Yeah, definitely. You too. Enjoy it. [looks at camera] You know what, just come here.
[laughs and swings his arm out which doesn't come close to touching the reception desk] I'm always this close.
Guys. Michael can't handle this and as your boss I'm saying we're not watching it.
Okay, I think everybody just needs to relax.
Those reports affect our bonuses, which is kind of great for me, because you wouldn't know it from looking at her, but Pam's a gold-digger.
And what Designing Woman are you basing that on?
Okay. You know what would help is a pros and cons list for our options.
Come on, Pam. Pam, I asked you if you could use the phone, and you swore that you knew how.
Wow, so that's it huh? Just, four o'clock and you are gone for good.
Ok, but wait. What if I told you that it was in Philly! So you'd have to...
No, you're right. And, and I'm not mad at Brian. And to be honest, I probably don't have any reason to be mad at all because I wasn't there. So, let's just forget about it.
You just got yourself kicked out of your apartment. [both laugh]
All right, you know what? [picks Pam up and carries her off the court] Let's do this.
An assistant brings their boss coffee with speed and dexterity. But an assistant to the assistant has a thousand times more to prove, am I right?
Wow, you've really embraced the whole Bond villain aesthetic.
Oh, and I forwarded his desk phone to mine.
All right. You know what? ��Maybe we���ll just... We���ll go slow.
So, I dunno, I just feel likes we've been dating a month, right? Same street. I think that might be a little close. A little much.
Mr. Maguire, it's been a couple of years.
Well it's a computer Dwight, computers have wires.
Yeah, I'm aware of that.  But he's also being super annoying.  And I'm not a perfect person.
Will you just talk to them, please? Pam just knew!
It's still happening right now actually, so uh...
Oh my God, oh my God, Karen is back!
Marijuana is a memory loss drug, so maybe you just don't remember.
Oh, don���t look at me cause I think you���re making a terrible choice.
I'll make it worth your while, I promise.
15 feet from the baseline, so, you need me to move it in?
All right, well it already went through, so...
No, no absolutely we are not doing this.
Mad?  How could I be mad?  We're having a little girl.
No, definitely. All right, dude. Awesome. Will do.
You know what I think we should do? I think we should just save the goodbyes for tomorrow. At lunch.
Wait a second, how are you qualified for that?
I just got a text from Robert California that says ���bring your clubs to Florida���.
Sure, that's true we can't compete with their prices. But let me ask you something. How important to you is customer service?
Animation? All her by the way. [points at Pam]
I'm not writing, 'Horse Hunt.' I don't even know what that means.
Not even a thought!  It's not even that far away! I could still commute! Exactly. Exactly! Alright!
Yes, we do have that. Hold on one second...
[in the phone] You know what, Pam? I was thinking maybe we should change course here. Let's give up on all this mean stuff.
[overhears loud monster noises] Its Monster dot com.  Singular.
Okay.  That is me, but I didn't order the cake.
Perfect. There are several outside candidates that we think would be really-
Yeah, well it's really warm in here. It's like a sleeping bag.
Yeah. Ok, here's the ... I had a crush on her before I left. And I told her about it and she didn't feel the same way. So, it didn't amount to anything, and I left. I'm really glad you're here. 'Kay?
You know what, just in case she's looking you should put some stuff in it.
I guess... all things considered, I was lucky Dwight was there.  And Roy was lucky that Dwight only used pepper spray.  And not the nunchucks or the throwing stars.
Great.  I will do that.  Sorry, Pam, I just feel a little bit frazzled.  And you know how very rarely I use that word.  Frazzled.
Could I have everyone's attention, please? I have some tough news, so I'm just gonna give it to you straight. Truth is, we only have so much money for raises this year, so the simple fact is some people will get raises, and some people won't. Now, what we've decided is, we are gonna give those raises to the sales staff.
What about Darryl? We can all agree that he's a stand-up guy, right?
Yeah. [Shot shows Kevin and Erin greasing floor of warehouse]
What if he jumps out the window and runs away?
Um, thank you, Ryan, uh, I don't know, I think I made the mistake one day of telling someone that I like penguins, and here we are.
It's just that Pam gets me through the day, you know? I really rely on her. I'm pretty emotionally needy.
My friend's basement. All right, ready to start?
Do you know if it's true? Do you have any idea? Because you might be ruining his life.
You���re gonna do great. And you know what? Mommy���s gonna record it. So we���ll watch it together. Do you mind doing that, Pam?
Oh God, I've been playing Zombie Soccer for two hours?
By the way, man, this place is... beautiful.
Yeah. No, I know. This whole telecommuting thing -- not ideal. But don���t worry. I���ll figure it out.
Call me when you get in. [kisses Pam]
I can't believe you guys.  I'm not going to go further piss off my ex-girlfriend.
New York City is 45 minutes down the road from here. And you wanna  move to Scranton? I dunno. If I were you I'd move to New York?
[Michael, Dwight, Andy and now Pam are in the circle and training their 'weapons' on each other, Jim walks in]  Really?
[to Michael] It's actually Blue Cross from Pennsylvania.
Oh, no, it was... you know, a good opportunity for me, a promotion. I got a chance to...
Honestly, I don't think Michael has the slightest clue of who he's gonna  fire. I think he keeps hoping that someone's going to volunteer. Uh, or be run over by a bus before the deadline. But in the end, really, what's going to happen is it's gonna be the first person to give him a dirty look in the hall. And therein lies the true essence of his charisma.
But more than once? 'cause you could have made a mistake.
Dwight, you can���t just hire someone ���cause they���re your friend.
We lost Bridgeport Capital. I have no idea what happened. It���s like everything I did, he just wouldn���t go for it.
OK, I'm gonna assume that was it. Here's the thing: I think you're right. I think it was Kelly. I think she's mad at us for not coming to her party.
Dwight. This, [picks up balloon] fits in the palm of my hand. You haven't blown 'em up enough. Why have you chosen brown and gray balloons?
No, no. If it's a big deal, it's a big deal.
Oh really? Who's gonna take you in? You're messy. You're a klutz, you spill everything. And you leave the volume on the TV way too loud.
Um, she's easy to talk to I guess and she's got a really good sense of humor.
It was just little thing, you know, like I could make something shake or I could make a marble fall off the counter. You know, just little things.
Nice. You know, I cleaned our daughter for like, an hour at four a.m. this morning, so...
Wow.  Um, ok. [pops Dwight's orb with scissors]
Hey, man. It���s halpert. Did you go to the other guy yet? Great, don���t. I���m in. Yeah, yep, I���m all in. Ok, talk to you soon. Bye. [hangs up] Yeah!
Where do I want to go? Um... that is an excellent question. And one I should have probably thought about before I called you. Um...
[entering office] Hey. So, we saw a new billboard.
[whispering] Okay, I'm gonna go in there and change the computer. Are you sure you can change his watch?
I do. That's what I'm best known for. Sitting out there. Alright, let's talk about purses.
Uh, how did you know they were black belts?
The Search Committee finally decided, after a lot of deliberation, on Robert California��� for the manager position. Who took one look around and left.�� He drove down to Florida and convinced Joe to make him CEO... CEO... her own job. He talked her out of her own job. And I don���t really know how someone does that. But, anyway, then the position was his to fill.���� And he chose���
Yeah, we're slow-playing it because of our stupid HMO.
That must be really fun for you and Marci huh?
Like, set up camp in your office and is calling herself the manager.
Well, that's great. Congratulations. Who's the lucky lady?
One day Michael came in complaining about a speed bump on the highway. I wonder who he ran over then.
[Jim moves his head closer and Pam taps him gently in the face] Oh, ok.
Well, I mean, I don���t even have the paycheck yet. It is a startup, so��� These things go down all the time.
What do we think, what would drive him crazy.
Who says no moustache? [Jim, Angela, and Phyllis raise their hands; Gabe enters, hiding Stanley's face]
Okay, so all we need is a theme... and cups, and ice, and punch, and a cake.
Con-- no one gets as much as they did last year.
[hands expense report to Oscar] Here you go. All done.
By the way, they do need an extra day next week.
Umm, is it me or does it smell like up-dog in here?
Um... Kevin, hands down. Yeah. He's really got that teddy bear thing going on, and afterwards, we could just watch bowling.
All right.  You're right, sometimes when she's tired, she can be a little bit shrill.  But that's not a weird voice.
We got to see Ping.  [Pam nods] And we learned of Michael's true feelings for Ryan. [Pam nods] Which was touching. And, we heard Michael change the lyrics to a number of classic songs. [Pam nods] Which for me, has ruined them for life. [looks at Pam, who is staring at him, nodding]
The new assistant to the assistant to the regional manager is Dwight K. Schrute.
If she can just hang on for a little while longer, I���this will be so huge for our family.
Michael had chicken potpie for lunch. Actually, let me rephrase that, Michael had an entire chicken pot pie for lunch, and- let me be more specific. Michael ate an entire family-sized chicken potpie for lunch and then he promptly fell asleep, so we're all trying to be very quiet so as to not wake him up before 5:00 pm. Which, actually, should be in about... ten minutes.
I'm so sorry. These must be very painful memories.
No, this is instead of the boycott. Yeah?
Why haven't I proposed yet? Uh, actually Pam and I talked about it. And we just decided that, um -- well, we didn't want to spend first three months of our engagement apart. And Pam's always said she doesn't want a long engagement. Something in her past, I guess. I'm not really sure of the whole story, but something about a guy who used to work here...
I don't know how we'd go about doing that.
No, Dwight, I meant... Yes, in a perfect world, someone would get money.  But-
It's like magic. Or, it's like me getting on my hands and knees and begging my partners to switch a Tuesday for a Thursday.
No, you won't, because he's not picking up his phone.
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?
Yeah.  [Jim leans in for a kiss but Pam turns away]  She's fine.
And even though... I came back, I just, I feel like I've never really... come back.
Dad, remember, no mention of the baby, right?
This is a really nice car. In case you haven't noticed, this is a Corolla. Okay.
Um, just for the day while Michael's at my desk.
[pumps fist] ...Saturday, so just let me know what you're doing tomorrow, Saturday, for lunch. Ok, talk to you soon.
[walks over to his desk and sees a present sitting on it, reading the note] 'Hey, Pickles, Merry Christmas. Open immediately. Love, Swiss Cheese.' [opens the present and a snowball shoots out at him, everyone laughs] Damn it, Dwight!
I have no idea where we���re gonna come up with this money, and we have to work insanely hard over the next few weeks.
Okay. The annex it is. I���ll be sitting at your desk if that���s okay with you.
So this warehouse has been around for what? Like a thousand years? And they never thought to back the truck up into it? I guess sometimes it just takes a fresh set of eyes. Alright! [knocks on side of truck]
I think that's the question that you had...
Oh, Somebody went in. That was a team effort, Pam.
And that is not the same at all. If you're going to ask other people to do it, you should do it yourself.
We waited too long!  Two minutes doesn't do us any good.  Well, what happened to four and three minutes?
Yep. That's exactly what my first thought was. And then I remembered having a conversation with him where he was like, 'I don't own an Ebay store,' so...
Great, It's under here as Security Guard home. Did you not get his name? Or...
Sorry, man, I can���t focus on zingers. There���s too many potential clients.
Two things I need you to understand. One, Pam and I are very happy together.
[presses drink button, looks at camera, makes Jim-face]
Alright. Let's clear this up. [on phone] Well, there's actually been a few changes in the company and Michael and I are actually at the same level. So, I can- no. Nope. Why would that be a problem?
I broke up with Karen after the job interview, and uh... it was a little awkward when she came back from the city. She told me, very clearly, just because we were broken up didn't mean she was going anywhere, because she worked really hard for her career. But the next day her desk was empty, and as for me and my current romantic life, I uh... I'm single now and looking, so if you know anybody.
Oh, that's not advice. What advice sounds like is this: umm, don't ever bring your purple belt to work because someone might steal it. [reveals Dwight's purple belt]
[Jim and Pam are walking outside] I just don't understand the desire to push sweet potato fries on me, and not just regular fries.
No. [Michael gets up and walks into his office]
I'll figure it out, get to the bottom of it....Merry merry.
[pops back into Jo's doorway] Thanks again by the way.
Are there, uh, three w's at the beginning of the address?
Yes, it is harassment and I'm going to be suing the winking face. I've hired the angry face as my lawyer and you will be hearing from him pretty soon.
- two percent milk! What I forgot for the coffee.
Wow.  I guess word got around.  That's a nice... honor.
Yeah, I filled out the expense reports. That took about five minutes and then I closed two sales at lunch time. So, about as productive as any other day. If not more so.
No, it was before I knew you so, its fine.
Where do all the cool kids go when they come to this consecrated ground?
[sings] Love me, love me, say that you love me, fool me, fool me,
[to camera] Michael's my only friend left in the office. Except Pam... I think. Is she still upset?
The new CEO works out of the conference room about half the time. But whenever he takes a break, he does these weird walks around the office. And you never know who he���s gonna zero in on for these really intense small-talks. You just hope it���s not you. And yet, you hope it is you too. It���s strange.
Wow! Look at that! It says he's actually playing State College. That's only three hours away!
And Beesly. Tonight we're in two seperate rooms and tomorrow night is the honeymoon suite.
The best news is, we're going to have a baby today.
Dwight, listen: no matter what happens, you gotta forget about all the other stuff. You gotta forget about logic and fear and doubt. You just gotta do everything you can to get to the one woman who���s gonna make all this worth it. At the end of the day, you gotta jump. You love Angela, Dwight. I think you always have.
OK, so Corporate is still in their meeting.
I won't.  But, you will wash and buff our car.
Mr. Decker, I'm sorry about that. What were you... Can you hold on one second? Yeah, just one second. Thanks. [Power off, silence] Hello? That's it. Perfect. So what I was saying... [Dialing tone] Hello? Thanks, Dwight.
Alright, Charles, I've gotta be honest. I think we really got off on the wrong foot here. And, truth be told, I'm a pretty smart guy, and, uh, a hard-worker.  And a great number two for the office.
Listen, I don't mean to intimidate you, but I did play a little high school ball.
Yep, I used to play soccer in school. From second to fourth grade. I was on the orange team.
Look, I would so take him in any other circumstance, but I'm pretty certain I'm completely wasted.
Well, I mean, that's OK. It doesn't mean that it's over. Right? I mean, couples fight.
[reading the screenplay] Inside the FBI, Agent Michael Scarn sits with his feet up on his desk.  Catherine Zeta Jones enters.
All right, let's get started. Umm... Oh, first off, we're supposed to be pushing cardstock this week. So... let's push cardstock this week. Uh, also... [to Dwight] what is this?
Not gravel, obviously. [both chuckle] No, things are good. Things are good. Got some stuff in the works. So-
Shut up, you, shut up!  This is the dumbest thing we've ever done.
All you're gonna need to [faking a bad connection] and-  it- and then go to--
So you guys are filming people when they go to the bathroom now?
Okay, I think the game's over... People are like leaving. There was a bigger crowd last time. Do you just want to go to lunch?
I���m sure you did not. What was your question?
You know, truth be told, I think all you���ll really be doing is accepting calls from my clients while I���m gone.
Just stay there. I'll be there in one second. Michael! Michael! Excuse me, sir there is a guy in the bathroom. He's coming out but I have to go because it's an emergency. Will you just tell him call the office. Just call the office! Thank you. Please?
OK. [Dwight runs in place] What are you doing? Are you really revving up? you know that doesn't work.
The Dunder Code! I completely forgot about that prank. That had to be like six or seven years ago. Stayed late every night for a month. Had a lot more free time back then.
Yeah. Definitely. Go Phillies, right. You don���t watch baseball. I keep forgetting that.
That is not why. Wow, man, he really wants to get in touch with you. Maybe it's a murder.
Kevin, you know what, why don't you close your eyes? Imagine that Hilary Swank comes into this office for real and she walks over to you [in a more and more seductive voice] and says Kevin Malone, I just read your online profile and there is nothing I would rather do then make out with you right now. And now you tell me something, is she hot? [Kevin gets up to join the 'hot' team to their great joy] Does that end the debate?
Mmm... it's like Michael said. It was some- something else.
Yes!  So close.  I really love the paper triangle flicking and hitting things game.  Yeah.
I want to clamp Michael's face in a George Foreman grill.
...and Pam was just going crazy, trying to take care of Philip because Cece has been out of control recently, and- look, Andy, it doesn't matter. The truth is, I just feel terrible lying to you.
Well that's great.  [shakes Ryan's hand] You're talking about your court ordered community service?
What do you mean? Of course it will. You're amazing.
I'm gonna make a bigger leap here. He is into you.
I gotta tell you, this baby is amazing. She gets me out of everything. And I - and I love her. I also love her, very much.
Yeah. You just sit right here. Here we go.
[laughing] She's probably going to, cause they sit next to each other.
And his wallet and phone are on the seat next to me.
Hmm... Well, maybe the CIA can send a helicopter?
Oh, Dwight, you're trying too hard, and that's just not classy. You see, the thing about classy is it's a state of mind.
[as Pam stares at him] I can feel you looking at me.
I think you might want to kneel for this. And yet, the manager for Dunder Mifflin kneels for no one. [Dwight awkwardly squats] That���s it. You look really, really good.
But what are you gonna do about that?
Yeah, was it 10? Yeah, I have it on a mix tape from junior high.
[drawing two family trees on a whiteboard] Jan is about to have a baby with a sperm donor. And Michael is preparing for the birth of a watermelon with Dwight.  Now, this baby will be related to Michael through [draws a question mark] delusion.
We just wanted to say we are very sorry.
Well, how could you, if it just erased your memory?
Well it is tempting but I am 100% leaning towards something else.
Nah, you definitely weren���t kidding.  And that came across loud and clear. Oh, by the way, I want to hand this in. [hands Andy slip of paper]
Uh, I really don't want to talk about it.
That actually took a while. I had to put, uh, more and more nickels into his handset, till he got used to the weight, and then I just... took 'em all out.
I'm just saying that you can't be sure that is wasn't you.
Oh yeah. I'm trying to move away from that. Getting into more of a bottled water phase.
So beautiful. [Pam's starts to cry.  Jim pulls up chair to sit next to her] Hey--
It reminds me of the orientation video showed on my first day. 'The Scranton Witch Project'.
Hey, what was that movie where their boss was within earshot and they could've just gone and talked to her.
I'm sorry, then do you mind explaining a little better? Cause I'm not sure what's really...
Well on the plus side all this worrying about China has made you smarter than Oscar, Michael.
We own our own delivery trucks. We could lease them out on the weekends --
There.  Now we're even.  [Pam laughs and mimes taking a picture, they kiss]
[playing Call of Duty] Oh? Someone's left out in the open, taking a little siesta. Not smart. [shoots] Yes! Finally killed you... [Karen's desk is empty]
What is that? [looks at sign that says 'IT IS YOUR BIRTHDAY.'] It is your birthday period.
Well, I'm not actually making a formal complaint. I just really think we should talk about it.
If I left, what would I do with all this useless information in my head? You know? Tonnage price of manila folders? Um, Pam's favorite flavor of yogurt, which is mixed berry.
Oh, hey, Pam and I are gonna go play pool with one of her friends, and we need a fourth.
Are you kidding? We're in Philly. We're having dinner together. And this is just consolation champagne. It's from the part of France that immediately gave up to the Nazis. Here.
Have you ever seen 'em do that? [walk outside and the parking lot is covered with snowmen]
Around here, Oscar is known as 'actually' because he will insert himself into just about any conversation to add facts, or correct grammar. He really does fit that old stereotype of the smug gay Mexican.
Now, would corporate approve a temporary price reduction for returning customers?
I think it's a cross between Dumbo and Jumbo, with a hint of chubby. It's not a name.
Well, maybe you should get back to work.
[holding up a sign that reads, 'Dwight picked the wrong day to put a wooden mallard in my office']
All right, I am connecting and ... you are not there. Did you install it right? How about this:  Go to applications--
[Pam is asleep, resting her head on Jim's shoulder] Um... Hey.
Alright I just have to ask now that we're public, um, is the magic gone?
It's still on a bike path though right?
