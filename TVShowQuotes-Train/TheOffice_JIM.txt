But at the same time she looks crazy and I do understand her reasoning.
Sure, yeah. Do whatever you need to do.
You���re not serious, are you? You didn���t get any of the recital?
OK. I have just convinced Dwight that he needs to go to Stamford and... [Pam starts laughing]... spy on our other branch. No no no.
I don't know. Where to begin? My ball.
You know what, I have an idea. Why don't we just do one big shared party?
[on phone] All right, Thank you, I will--I will send the contracts over right away. All Right. [hangs up the phone and rubs his eyes] Whoo! [Erin jumps in the background]
So by that rationale, if I had to sneeze, I should just sneeze on you.
Well, uh... I don't think any of us really know. Alright. [Jim hands Pam a present]
What was my worst first date?  Umm.  It was a couple of years ago.  It was a lunch date, actually, it was right down here, at Cugino's.  And we had just met, and we really hit it off, it was, it was kinda nice.  Umm, huh.  And, uh, then, as it turned out, it wasn't even a date, because she was actually in love with someone else.  So, best first date is also my worst first date.  Oddly enough.
Check this out though, spin serve. [serves, and Dwight scores] Well, it works like 80% of the time, so...
Actually, when I was seven, my Dad took me to the Natural History Museum in New York. And we looked at fossils all day. And at the end of the day, he got me a little plastic triceratops. It was awesome.
You don't think you should sit in the back with Dwight?
But the paint's chipping. Is that your old bike, Michael?
Oh, just somewhere in the Poconos. I was just surfing.
All right. Now I think it's time for you to go.
Yes. We will be requiring a bed time story.
Yeah, woah. [deeper voice] Yep, absolutely, go ahead.
I'm sure they'll want to meet her, too.
It is, yeah. I mean I just don't know why I'm compromising if it's my fantasy. Cause in my fantasy it's Maine and you love it.
I'm sorry, how did you think I was expected to guess that?
Can I just have the ham and cheese sandwich, thanks.
No. Not gonna do it right here, that would be rather lame.
[nervous laughter] Right. Okay, uh, over the next three months...
[waiting for Fred to continue] ...What is it?
Hmm... Well, maybe the CIA can send a helicopter?
No, no absolutely we are not doing this.
That's not really true. There's a lot of things you can do with an art degree actually.
Where do all the cool kids go when they come to this consecrated ground?
So you know my job has something to do with sports, but you don't know the end of the word 'Philadelphia'?
This is a really nice car. In case you haven't noticed, this is a Corolla. Okay.
Well it is tempting but I am 100% leaning towards something else.
Simple data entry, though. So there's really only one way to do it.
No, I'm not going to tell my nine-months-pregnant wife that I find her replacement objectively attractive. Just like I���m not going to tell my two-year-old daughter that violent video games are objectively more fun. It's true, but it doesn't help anybody.
Oh, great. [reads] 'Glad they didn't mix up your tonsillectomy with a moustachectomy.' Oh that's not good.
Wow, you got totally taken for a ride Beesley.
[arm around Pam] Thank you for trying to defend her. But actually, Pam is pregnant, and we can prove it.
Listen, I don't mean to intimidate you, but I did play a little high school ball.
[using black voice] Good afternoon! [Darryl smacks his arm]
Yeah, well, with you it's different, okay? Cause I just- I just suck. I just- I suck!
Wait. What? [Pam nods her head] You knew? And you didn't say anything?
Nope. When Jo's here, can you work in 'Shagadelic, baby,' at least three times in a conversation? Oh, and when I cough can you do jazz hands?
[dictating to Pam] Not sure.  Just became self-aware.  So much to figure out.  I think I am programmed to be your enemy.  I think it is my job to destroy you when it comes to selling paper.
[trying to hide from Michael what they're doing, he picks up the phone and talks directly into it] All right, so just pack your bags and, uh, be sure to bring those swimming trunks! Bye now! [hangs up]
Buenos dias, Miguel. Como estas? Bien? Claro que si! Yo estoy fantastico. Que pasa?
Not important.  Because you're not dating her.  Because it's a felony.
Call me when you get in. [kisses Pam]
Could be. But you also called her the second time so you had the number right.
My mom thinks you're too dumb to hang out with.'
[Michael in his office playing music loudly, Jim walks in and turns the volume down, Michael trailing off on singing]  We have to do something because people are losing it out there wondering what's going to happen.
I'd hang on to it though, cause I can think of a bunch. Like a 70's theme party, or a 70's theme meeting, or a 70's theme convention...
If anyone can do this, you can do this.
Yep.  No, I mean I really liked it.  I thought was uh, a fun read.
I think you could just do Andy Bernard.
[leaning against Creed's desk] So I am collecting $3 from everybody. For Kelly's party.
No, it was not a disaster. It was weird, but it wasn't a disaster. I think we have, like, a gift bottle of Irish cream.
[as Andy and Kevin shout 'yeah!' in response to Michael] Okay, I feel like this noise is going to prevent Pam from being able to listen to her body's signals.
Because it is Halloween. So if you���re going to sing a concert, it���s a good idea to throw that one in.
[noticing that everyone is giving him a sympathetic look] How does everyone know already?
I got this. [taking Katy's bag from Michael]
I can't believe I'm saying this, but Michael is actually killing it with Holly. And I think I know why. It's because Holly is kind of a major dork.
Oh, I don't really do that. But Pam might have some friends, though.
I'm not writing, 'Horse Hunt.' I don't even know what that means.
Oh, hey, Pam and I are gonna go play pool with one of her friends, and we need a fourth.
I looked at you coming around, and I said, ���Wintergreen.���
Yeah, but you're gonna need a permit for that.
All right, you know what? You're just trying to get rid of our best player.
Hey, can I talk to you guys for a second?
I know. [Gabe and Darryl stand on either side of Jim with paper and pens in hand]  Just the guys.  Well, maybe that's, uh, part of the problem.  I think...so what happened was, I was talking with some of the department heads.  Uh, some of the female department heads.
That's very interesting. Um, I feel like there might be a conflict there, and if a conflict did arise, how would that be dealt with?
Definitely. Yes. Glad you said that. ...You don't want to help me with some of my sales, do you? 'Cause, I'm kind of swamped.
That's right. The janitor said that. By the way, the raccoons are back.
Okay, okay. Um, how 'bout, the ultimate team player? [Pam laughs and types]
Well, that is because that is the gift that keeps on giving. Oh, my God. I left today's paper on my desk.
You know, that's probably not gonna last too long, you should go to a hospital and get a real cast.
Today I will be asking David Wallace if I can start working part-time, because the sports marketing company that I started really needs me to be there.
Okay, Dwight, you know what? You'd be getting the raise so--
Jan didn't come back for her car last night.
I'll figure it out, get to the bottom of it....Merry merry.
That���s pretty good.  What about uh, for a thousand points?
Hey. So now that we are dating, uh, we just wanted to know if we had to sign one of those 'we're dating' things for the company.
Well, now we won't get lost. Or we could drive. And that takes one minute.
Wow. This whole Philly thing has been so much fun that I may have lost sight of what really matters. I mean, having fun is not nearly as important as being good to the people who you really care about. I mean, that's just 'Roommates 101'.
So, I guess Pam and Dwight are friends now.
Who wants Phyllis as Santa? [most everyone raises their hand]
No, no, no, no. Yes. We saw this, yes. No, it wasn't like a look around. We really just had a peek. Quick peek. Didn't focus on anything in particular.
Let me just see that one more time. Yep, you know what? I know who my friends are, now. But I shouldn't have got you involved because the truth is, I don't even really care about this picture, it���s a little out of focus. It was probably an accident, right? Like...
[pointing to computer monitor] So, we've typed in the address, now let's take a look at the street view. [picture of Dwight and Mose on a see-saw]
Pam's with Roy. I'm with Karen. And, uh, Brangelina is with Frangelina. Movin' on.
Um, like stapler tennis or something like that.
No, I told you to warn me at five minutes.
[under breath] Oh, no, not while I'm here.
Cathy? It's been great. Fun, normal. [in voiceover] I thought I was gonna be hanging out with stanley on this trip, but he's turned out to be kind of a loose cannon.
[A note is on Jim's computer that says, 'It is time. Parking lot at noon.' Jim nods and hands it to Dwight who burns it.]
Doesn���t seem like anyone cares about us anyway.
Nice to meet you, yeah.  Whew!  I can assure you we don't need a new system though.  Happy with ours.
What are you doing here? Did you come back for us, or...
Better theory. This is her ex-boyfriend and they went through some kind of painful breakup.
Nah, I think it's mine. Lemme just check real quick, here. Alright.
That's impossible. [Dwight climbs through ceiling hatch] Dwight!
Oh, you'd understand if you read the memo which I should probably get you, there's probably one in a drawer... uh. It was pretty crazy. But, uh, not more crazy than wearing a tux, at work, I grant you that... so, uh.
Pam texted back saying we could give them all iPods.
I'm just gonna grab some chips, you want some?
I am extremely interested. So, how much will all of this cost?
Uh, can you get this rundown for me?' [impersonating Charles]
Oh, Clark. I���m actually here today. Surprise! So I was wondering if I could maybe have my desk back.
I am on the two kid sleep schedule so I'm up and at 'em at four fifteen, but no kids, so I honestly didn't know what to do with myself, and then I thought of something. Uh- [hears door, hides]
So, you just couldn't take it anymore, huh?
I'm sorry. This is for a news audition?
I don���t know, for such a crazy number I���d like something pretty crazy.
Yeah. So, uh, I'll uh, talk to you later?
Okay. Yesterday, we had a meeting about planets.
You should ask him. It���s a color you would never expect. [Dwight storms off] Too easy.
I found Dwight's wallet in the parking lot.
[on phone] Hey, Dan, this is Jim, and it is about 11:15, and I wanted to know what you were up to tomorrow, which is the fifteenth, and that is a...
You know, it's getting real crowded in here.  Maybe you guys should all go back to work because the day's not out yet.
Look, Pam, I don���t know what to tell you. I mean, what do I do? It���s gone. That moment���s just gone. I missed it.
Yes. Listen, you are spending way too much time talking to me, when you could be talking to her.
Ok, but wait. What if I told you that it was in Philly! So you'd have to...
Not your fault. I'm sorry I misinterpreted our friendship.
Oh my God, oh my God, Karen is back!
You know what? I think you just need to meet him.
No, no, see? This is what we're talking about. I mean, what was that accent? And last time I checked, you were drunk and now you're not drunk...
That's amazing. Well, listen. You can't win 'em all, right?
Yeah sure. You want to look at it first?
Oh by the way how's your side project going?
So you thought they meant your reason for coming to the hospital.
[at company picnic] All right, you ready for this?
Yes it does. Yes it does my friend. Ok, we will be competing for gold, silver and bronze yogurt lids.
The song is about losing your virginity next to a church, and guess what - she's been singing for the last twenty minutes!
Well, I mean, I don���t even have the paycheck yet. It is a startup, so��� These things go down all the time.
Now, wait a minute.  You're not gonna punch a wall, or me, or anything like that if you don't win the point, are you?
Oh, um...[mimicking Stanley] Why do you keep CC'ing me on things that have nothing to do with me?  [Pam and Oscar laugh, Stanley walks in, and Oscar leaves quickly]
I seem to have sticky not emergency where I grab it on the wrong end, and this happens.
I just walked in on someone in the bathroom.
Pam can't drink? I didn't-- I shouldn't have said that. I don't know why I did. She can do whatever she wants, though she shouldn't. She shouldn't because she's an alcoholic. Pam is an alcoholic. That's not true. I-- no. What we want-- the real reason is that, that Pam's pregnant.
What do we think, what would drive him crazy.
Oh, is she that teacher in the white?
I really don't know.  How you doing with all this?
I'm sorry, I'm really, really sorry. I think I was just relieved, to see that Michael Scarn got his confidence back.
[grunts] Good game. You are a worthy opponent. You wanna play one more?
We got to see Ping.  [Pam nods] And we learned of Michael's true feelings for Ryan. [Pam nods] Which was touching. And, we heard Michael change the lyrics to a number of classic songs. [Pam nods] Which for me, has ruined them for life. [looks at Pam, who is staring at him, nodding]
Let me talk to you about a few of the other things we can offer. Namely, we know the tax season is coming up, so by April 1st we can have you fully stocked.
Did you say something about this one bringing in something for these people?
I don't want to be biased, but I am very close to Ryan.  You know that.
[conducting interview] Your paper experience is very interesting. Do you think you could use that experience to inform decisions here?
That is not why. Wow, man, he really wants to get in touch with you. Maybe it's a murder.
Yeah, I do. C'mon. [they hold hands and cross street]
Sorry, you're going to have to speak up a little bit louder. I'm hard of hearing.
Ahh, I love staring off in one direction. If I���m not looking south, I���m not livin���.  That���s what I always say.
My charity is the Lackawanna County Volunteer Sheriff's Department, because Dwight's a Volunteer Sheriff. So I thought this was a perfect opportunity to support/mock him.
I was just thinking that because this person is gonna be sitting at my desk, near my wife���
Do you think Dwight's bein' a little weird today?
Oh, hello Mater. Good news: I've married. Tell Fater. [hangs up] Such a nice woman.
This morning the phone guy comes in, and he shows Michael that the phones have a PA function. And then he just left.
Robert, thank you. Thank you for this. Thank you for all this. This night's been magical.
Several times a day, Michael says words that are way beyond my vocabulary.
That's a bummer. OK, then we need to...[steps outside office] Hey everybody. Hi, how you doing? Can I have your attention please?  'Cause we have to talk about this birthday thing.
Well, that was apple-picking day and there's no need to yell that day, you know. I was just excited to find the car. Perfect end to a perfect day.
I really heard him on that. This one's interesting I'm not really sure what he meant by this. Um, 'Dwight Schrute Privates.' Tough to say.
I am off to New York. My brother Pete from Boston, and my brother Tom from New Jersey are taking Pam and I out for lunch, to celebrate the engagement. Or maybe to beat me up. I can never tell with those two.
But more than once? 'cause you could have made a mistake.
Alright. Let's clear this up. [on phone] Well, there's actually been a few changes in the company and Michael and I are actually at the same level. So, I can- no. Nope. Why would that be a problem?
Five years ago, corporate said we had to start a recycling program for Earth Day so Dwight took the lead on that and introduced us to a very close friend of his named Recyclops.
Oh, it's on uh Linden Ave?  By the quarry?
Toby's great. He's great, but sometimes he can be a little bit much. [in Toby voice] I don't see the harm in that. Well, it's a cake Toby, so, c'mon.
Hey, Mike.  Since Roy left I've been doing a lot more work, and I need a raise.
Yeah sorry everyone else didn���t come.  I think they���re just tired.  With holes in their shoes.  And they have dysentery.
Was it, like, trickery in the lights, or maybe you were so primed to see it, then there it was?
A year after that Recylcops really began to take shape.
Dwight and I are both writing letters to our clients. I'm just sending a quick note to say how much I appreciate their business, and he is writing notarized letters to inform them them that lying on customer reviews is a prosecutable form of fraud and defamation. It's just... different styles.
So he's kind of like santa, except dirty and worse.
So. We got Kev some stuff. Um... a party pack of M&M's, his favorite candy. A DVD of American Pie 2, which is his favorite movie, and, he lent it to Creed, so, I can guarantee you he won't get that back.
You know, the more I think about it, the more I think we should give it to the salesmen.
I'm sorry, I feel like maybe I'm-I'm I misread things. Okay, let's just go back to watching.
Shut up, you, shut up!  This is the dumbest thing we've ever done.
Quick question: uh, why is Tom Hanks on the wall?
I'll take over. Um, what we're doing here: Michael handles more of the 'big-picture' stuff, and I handle more of the day-to-day stuff, so together...
I don't know.  Feel like... Friday night crowds...
Pam, you know he's not gonna get anywhere, and he's gonna blow our sale.
Well, it's too late, because I'm proposing... that you get me a cup of coffee, which would energize me greatly, and make me the happiest man in the world.
There's the rundown you asked for. I may have expanded some areas that you weren't prepared for.
Okay, quick. Who says moustache? [Pam, Oscar, Dwight, and Creed raise their hands]
Uh, no one really knows, but Pam's parents are going through a little bit of a rough patch in their marriage.
Alright, let's get this started.  I'm gonna be reading the action descriptions, and Phyllis, I would like you to play Catherine Zeta Jones.
[walks quickly to break room, opens cabinet and finds mugs of Oscar, Creed and Phyllis]
The next year he really stepped things up.
Excuse me. How long is the wait for a table for two?
The real reason that I went to Stamford... was because... I wanted to be... not here.
Today, I am meeting a potential client on the golf course, because Ryan put me on probation. You remember Ryan, he was the temp here. Yeah. And uh, it is not a good time for me to lose my job. Since I have some pretty big long term plans in my personal life with Pam, that I'd like her parents to be psyched about. So I am about to do something very bold at this job that I've never done before. Try.
Uh, man, by the end I guess it was about... ten...
Hey, congratulations on that black belt, man. It���s really great.
Let's be honest, it's not totally my fault. [indicates Pam]  Shared responsibility.
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa. [Michael skates by]
Is this about the popcorn? Or the X on the ceiling? Dwight, that was a prank.
Now are you getting all your paper from PPC? Or-
No. This is a fire cracker free wedding.
[on the phone]I can have it to you by the beginning of next week.  Alright? Thanks very much. [hangs up] Uh, Phyllis! Bracken Auto?
[pops back into Jo's doorway] Thanks again by the way.
I just don't know if he's presidential enough.
Ok to speak my truth, that was a little sarcastic. I think that's a little unfair.
Oh man, that's fresh squeezed. And, uh are all the snacks complimentary?
Oh, my God!  Look at her!  baby, she's so beautiful!  Oh, my God.
[Michael steals the ball] Yeah, Michael. Go Michael. [makes shot]
I liked you better when you were the temp.
[laughs] Yes! Five bucks each. And it was totally worth it.
Is this a bad time to be doing this?
Nellie, that reminds me. Do you want this chair in the bedroom? 'Cause to be honest, I don't think it's gonna fit through the door.
Woah, woah, woah. Do you know what you just agreed to?
Keeping it simple -that's what I'm doing. But I am working hard on this one. Real hard.
Oh, I'm sorry I don't know... what we're talking about...
It's true. I'm having a party.  I've got three cases of imported beer, a karaoke machine, and I didn't invite Michael.  So three ingredients for a great party.  And it's nothing personal, I just think that if he were there, people wouldn't be able to relax, and you know, have fun, and my roommate wants to meet everybody.  Because I'm pretty sure he thinks that I'm making Dwight up.  [sighs]  He is very real.
[touches headset] Call you right back. What were you saying?
No, no, it's okay, I'll be right back.
That's interesting. Wow, it's a little early for ice cream, don't you think?
Well, Pam I'm not gonna lie to you, he's chances are none. Um, he's 41 years old, he is losing his hair and his cell phone ring is 'Mambo #5.' So...
I don���t even know where the stairs are!
[To Dwight] So it looks like this work bus was a pretty good idea after all, huh?
My friend's basement. All right, ready to start?
Hey, I have a question. Who do you think is really the best salesman in this office?
OK. Yeah, you know what, we're just gonna throw you in. Because more the merrier, right?
Ok, ok. We are so close. All we have to do is figure out that corner and we're basically there.
[explaining PowerPoint to Donna] So, yes, laser printers are more expensive. But they cost less to operate [knocking] So it's a tradeoff.
We have a lot to do, and you are... putting up a very effeminate sign. Is that what you've been doing, is making a sign?
Yes. This is going to be very interesting. All right, I'm out of here. See you later?
Hey, Abby. I wanted to give you this for all your hard work today. Look. Michael signed it and everything. Official.
Yeah. Ok, here's the ... I had a crush on her before I left. And I told her about it and she didn't feel the same way. So, it didn't amount to anything, and I left. I'm really glad you're here. 'Kay?
Yeah, let's face it. This meeting sounds like it's Wonka fans only. He's never seen the movie. [David laughs]
Well we all want a good party, right?
[Reading Pam's palm, while she has on extremely padded gloves] Wow, that is really interesting.
[getting out of a taxi] There you go. Thanks.
Hey. It is my business when it happens at work.
Alright. Then we're back to cash. And I got to say, if giving a small percentage of our commissions is going to smooth all this over, I'm for it.
[On the phone] Right, oh let me just check the pricing list.  Hold on one second...
I didn't think you were going to get that one. I really didn't.
We gotta get someone else in there right now.
OK, Ryan you know what? You can do this.
Okay, Dwight, come on. [to old man] You can go first.
I don't think you're good at making tough decisions!
Those are the books that sum up the other books.
No, I won't.   Alright, thanks for giving me your time,  I appreciate it.
I didn't tell Michael because I thought he'd try to help.  Example, he handed out Jello shots at the 23rd mile of the Steamtown marathon.
[shakes Michael's hand] I will see you, tomorrow at lunch.
Really?  Looks like I hired the right guy.  I'm glad.  Any real potential there Beesley?
OK, well, if you've never been sick, then you don't have any antibodies.
Madge from the warehouse just made her first sale. Madge. We should have been doing this a long time ago.
No, I'd probably buy a big piece of land in Maine, build a house, work in town. Somewhere I could bike to or kayak to. I'd either bike to my job at the kayak shop or kayak to my job at the bike shop.
And I didn't tell anyone because I'm not really sure how I feel about it.
[imitating game announcer] You win. [Darryl throws empty can on floor] How good did that feel?
Hi, yeah, can I talk to one of your travel agents?
Well, I know this sounds crazy, but how would King Arthur choose the next knight of his round table?
No- Ok. Well, we'll talk about it later. Straussburg! I had a meeting in Straussburg and I dropped you off beforehand. I was wearing a tan shirt with stripes?
Totally, no problem.  What are you interviewing for, by the way, my assistant? Or...
Stanley. Just played Dunder Ball with Toby. What about you, you got any games?
...I'm messing with Andy. I'm sending him to all the women in the office with... just... terrible information on how to get them to go out with him.
Once a year Dwight holds a seminar updating us on the newest developments in the world of karate... because as we all know, the one thing thousand year martial arts do all the time is change.
This shouldn't be coming from his boss. And we should also consider the fact that that man has an anger issue.
Okay, okay, you know, just sometimes you���re not the best with the phone.
I just have a meeting, uh, outside the office.
Hey, Dwight, sounds like she was 14, so maybe we wanna go a little easy.
Well, those things that you consider doodles, I consider art.
Like, set up camp in your office and is calling herself the manager.
Oh, yeah, I should, I should, I should probably go too.
Sorry, uh do we need to sign one, or...?
Oh, it���s happening!  Let���s just keep it between you and me for right now.
[to Eric] You're gonna regret that when you find yourself between a moose and her cubs.
This is the last time I'll ever see Dwight. It's a weird feeling, it's, um, what's the word? It's not, it's not bittersweet. It's uh... sweet. Yeah.
-I just don't know if I can do it.
No way! What did I say? I said that they'd love those sketches. Congratulations!
I hope you're not killing yourself on this, because I'm sure it's good enough for Michael's ad that will probably be seen by no one.
Wha- no. No, it was not a poisoning.
Shut up. Mavis Beacon doesn't even type 90.
Ok, well, you're the one who lost the desk.
No, no, no! Don't give him mouth to mouth for this!
Okay, well, you know what? Everybody's hungry. [Pam looks at Jim] Sorry. I think I'm just hungry.
Pam, I'm not gonna tell you. Hate to break it to you, but that's not how that works.
So, I guess I'll see you in [looks at watch] ten hours.
You threw the summoning bag at me, sir?
I can't say whether Dunder Mifflin paper is less flammable, sir, but I can assure that it is certainly not more flammable.
If you could help me out, that would be���
Well, then, I should figure out things to do while I���m waiting.
And I took it right back. It was like...
All right, I know, I know. Let's just get this.
I think you might be going a little crazy with this labeling thing, man. I mean, you put your name on a five pound bag of flour. Are you honestly saying that if I needed flour I couldn't use that?
Hey, Michael.  I just scheduled lunch with a client so I might be back a little late.
No, they can't. That's not how this is gonna work. [exhales] We're going in this room, we're going to have a meeting. We're gonna make a recommendation to Jo, and she's gonna give you her recommendation on Monday. Okay? [to Kelly and Toby, as they re-enter the conference room] What the hell happened out there? [Kevin tries to follow, but the door is closed on him]
Andy, you gotta check this out. He just showed me���[gets interrupted by Andy].
No, um. How is this not a pyramid scheme?
The guys at Athlead are still bugging me about this three month roadshow thing. Meeting athletes on their home turf, building relationships. Yeah, it sounds exciting. But I said no, and that���s final. I almost lost Pam over this business. I���m not risking that again.
I'm a three hole punch version of Jim. 'Cause you can have me either way. Plain White Jim, or Three-hole Punch.
The minister just told me that it���s tradition for the Bestish Mensch to be older than the groom.
[driving, sighs, laughs] No. you know what? No. Because... I'm not that guy. And [laughs] we are not that couple. [turns around]
Very nice. Very nice sales pitch for our clients that don't know what paper is.
I mean I like all the crazy monsters and stuff.  You know, like klingons and wookies and all that but... [Dwight begins to turn around again, Jim holds up the watch] Sorry, was there something you wanted to add, Dwight?
Oh my goodness, let's take a look at these. They're usually amazing, so let's see. Yup, they are. Uncle Andy.
It's not a big deal. I'll come visit you. And you'll visit me. It's only two hours away. It'll be fine. That part's gonna suck, but it'll be great.
Pretty good. You must be almost out of water.
No way. Let's do this [crumples post it and throws into mug. Misses.] Oh.
I guess I thought you were approaching it with more of a sarcasm than misery. Kind of laughing at your own pain, sad clown thing.
Pre-conference room meeting with Dwight went really well.
K, Kevin, are you saying ���See the world���? or ���Sea World?���
Oh, [clearing throat, deeper voice] Sorry, I uh... was just saying that we should uh...
No, that's alright, thank you though. It's, I, gotta do some cleaning, should probably stick around here.
My god, I���m so sorry. Well this might make up for it: I think I have found an enormous source of overlooked PFN.
That's true. Um... dinner sounded delicious. Pam I'll see you at home, thank you so much.
OK, OK. I have something that totally tops the box.
Aw, that sounds like a lot of fun.
No. I just missed my wife.[Gives Pam a hug and a kiss]
No no no it's ok. So, Cece is with daddy now. She's laughing and she's happy. And we are on our way to see Dr. Barbra.
Dwight, I didn't poison you. I was kidding.
Oh it was when she was working in New York so it was halfway between both of us.
I didn't ask you. [back to Michael] Would you like to talk? [walks away]
Yeah I told her a long time ago she could do it.
Because the fun part is, you get to decide on an hour of television, or an hour of napping.
Uh, on a scale of one to ten, I'd say I'm about a four.
Oh, it���s the girls. Hey Pam. What? Angela���s been kidnapped! Phyllis left the door open and some freak came and grabbed her and fled.
[demonstrating with napkin holder and salt shaker] So Phyllis, he was here, and then the car came and did- he was like that. Yeah, so it had to be a double backflip, actually.
Robert, just wanted to grab you one second. This place is amazing, by the way.
I was thinkin' about more like a CD, or... a CD.
Sure. Mr. Davis, let me call you right back. Yeah, something just came up. Two minutes. Thank you very much. Dwight, what are you doing?
[after 'the kiss'] You have no idea how long I've wanted to do that.
Barely, I... I don't have all the facts.  Frank and Bean...
Alright. So why don't you just give me my share of the leads, and I'll start making some calls?
What? What am I gonna do? I don���t ���
It���s insane. This huge investor got cold feet, so I���m stuck here trying to keep him on board.
[mimicing Dwight in high-falsetto voice] Hi my name's Dwight Schrute and I would like to buy a purse from you. Good lord, look at these purses! This is something special. Oh my God is this Salvatore Di-chini-asta?
Nope. Not for you it's for your hair, and it is 9 am.
Look, is there a birthday you remember that you loved?
Swear to God. [Pam shakes her head]. Aww this is great. I was actually gonna wait and tell you on your birthday, but this is much more fun.
Yeah. As a child, did Pam show any traits that would hint towards her future career as a receptionist?
Okay, I think everybody just needs to relax.
I broke up with Karen after the job interview, and uh... it was a little awkward when she came back from the city. She told me, very clearly, just because we were broken up didn't mean she was going anywhere, because she worked really hard for her career. But the next day her desk was empty, and as for me and my current romantic life, I uh... I'm single now and looking, so if you know anybody.
I need you to breathe in my face right now.
Can we at least all agree that this is uncomfortable, and may be heading for something bad?
Time. Space. Gender. [Dwight mouthing words] There are no rules anymore. All boundaries are breaking down in the wake of the infinite future. The only thing that -- the only thing that remain -- the only thing that remains are the things that have stood the test of time -- love, values, and of course, the pyramids -- the strongest shape ever constructed, a shape that fits all other shapes inside of it. [softly] No, that���s --
I just���really wish there was something I could do. [looks off]
[approaches Roy back at the wedding] There he is. Is it almost time to cut the pancake, or what?
So there was a little bit of a miscommunication here today.  It's been a little wild, uh, but I am on it.
Um, I know that it involves spying on people and we may build a fort, underground.
[walks in, see's Oscar, Stanley, Creed and Kelly sitting in Michaels office] Okay, I thought I saw people missing.
So, I either get more involved, or I take a sick day... leaving Dwight in charge. Oh God.
Is that... I didn't know that was your... okay, so we're in agreement, this is not ideal... situation.
Dwight and I used to go on sales calls all the time. In fact, I have a picture to remember that time. Oh young Jim. There is just so much I need to warn you about. And yet, tragically, I cannot.
Mm, hey driver. Why don���t you take us to 3030 Adams?
It's a killer new dance move. [re-enacts leaning back] Do you wanna talk in your office?
Oh. Well. I feel that as someone who knows Pam only a little bit... enough. A good amount. Not the most, though. I would say that she is misunderstood and that maybe there's some stuff in her past that you guys don't know about that's a little messed up and probably makes her such a torture to work with.
Hey, I am wondering if this is a, uh, terrible idea.
Oh, that's because at first it was a made up position for Dwight, just to make him feel better, assistant to the regional manager. But then he lost that, and Michael gave it to me.
Hold on, just wanna get it on camera. [holds up cellphone]
I was thinking... fireworks for the party. What do you think?
Mmm, that's where you're wrong.  I'm your project supervisor today, and I have just decided that we're not doing anything until you get the chips that you require.  So, I think we should go get some.  Now, please.
Oh, and by the way, hate that you're helping her with this right now.  Totally.
You know what would energize me? If you, Pamela Morgan Beesly...
There���s actually not a rule that says that.
Ok, I know where you're going with this, and this is who I am now. I'm a douche. But look what I can do with my hands. [Pam laughs]
I think they're going to the conference finals.
He plays guitar, he likes naval history. He's a bowler.
You're the boss. Don't you think we'd all be a lot more productive if while we were doing work we looked up and saw the best rural pie stand in Pennsylvania?
[yawning] What about an energy drink or something?
Hey dude, you know what a 'rundown' is?
Dwight, it's not a factory at all. Do you have to do what you are doing? [Dwight is tapping each of the bobble heads on his desk and making them bobble]
Umm, is it me or does it smell like up-dog in here?
Perfect. There are several outside candidates that we think would be really-
Hmm, that logic's air-tight, but unfortunately it wasn't conceived here.  Burning man, port-o-potty.
Okay! Well this isn't my best, but call Froggy101, say that we're the tour manager for Justin Bieber, and we're giving away free tickets, we give him a number to call for the tickets, and it's his own number.
Well they didn't dine so, yeah, maybe they just dashed.
Hey! How are ya? I thought you left?
Karen suggested that I get a haircut for the interview tomorrow so that I could look presentable and not, as she so lovingly puts it, homeless.
No, let the record show that Dwight K. Schrute is now completely nude and is holding a plastic knife to Stanley's neck?!
Okay, so I know about most of these, but you know you can...
I'm going. I'm a little nervous to run into Dwight on his connecting flight to Mordor. But, other than that... um, yeah, I bought the ticket, non-refundable.
Yeah, definitely. You too. Enjoy it. [looks at camera] You know what, just come here.
Man, you can really hold your liquor, Billabelli.
Oh, my God. I have never seen that look in a man's eyes... ever. I thought that I might die. On beach day.
I think all of us have a tendency to view celebrities as sort of mythical figures, you know? We don't really see them as real so therefore we don't judge them as real people.
Um, just for the day while Michael's at my desk.
Party planning is literally the stupidest thing I have ever done in my life.
All right. Let's move on. Let's move on to the main event. Who Would You Do?
Thanks, Kev. Uhm... I'm actually going on a date.
[crosses fingers] We'll see. [Dwight begins smashing pencils with his phone] This is why the whole downsizing thing just doesn't bother me.
Thank you. Oh, thank you very much. Appreciate it.
Dwight's room key. And... Dwight's room. What can I say? Old habits die hard.
Ha ha.  No, yeah, that will be good.
There is no inner circle.  Deangelo just prefers to delegate a few things, to a few guys.
Hey it���s Jim Halpert.  I was wondering if you wanted to see a movie tonight.  Because I���ve read a lot about this really great documentary.
OK. Uh, Karen, any news from that law firm?
I... why don't we go back to this animation.
Ah...[sees Dwight's wallet and open email] I'm gonna s- [see's Dwight watching from break room]
Alright, then I will catch you later��� What do we do now?
So, the plan was seven minutes.  But we're calling an audible, because that's her call.  Because she's the quarterback.  I'm just the left tackle who happened to get her pregnant.
Dwight has made me his bestisch mensch. Which is Schrute for best man. He���s putting himself entirely in my hands tonight. And I know for over 12 years I���ve done nothing but trick and prank him but tonight���only good surprises. ���Guten Pranken���. [chuckles]
And, also, any forms that you are going to need...
She's, um, she's in New York. She's at an art school.
Okay, so what do you want to do?
Yes, it is harassment and I'm going to be suing the winking face. I've hired the angry face as my lawyer and you will be hearing from him pretty soon.
Ok fine, three hints. One! When you are getting colder, you're really getting warmer.
Mmm. Hey, can you ignore those and do something for me instead?
Stressed, but to be fair, it was a tense situation.
Oscar, yes. You're right to stop it. Thank you. Eject it.
Hey, um, I think you parked my car in. Is there any way you can move your van?
Alright, Great Scott, if you found that choking hazard poster, just head on home.
What would you say if I told you we could pull a prank on Dwight and at the same time not be working?
Yeah, I had just told you about the day that I met the Blue Angels. I figured you had to top it.
Mr. Maguire, it's been a couple of years.
Yeah, alright Kev why don���t you come with us?
I started a new business with my college friend. But, Pam doesn���t know. Um��� actually I did tell Pam and we decided ���no���. But, then I decided 'yes' anyway. So, I���m thinking there���s another conversation coming. And, it���s hard to know when that will be.
Ohh.. [Michael goes to hug Pam, phone rings]
[as he and Pam flip their cards] John Stamos.
Ok, thank you, gotta get back to work.
[to Pam] I'm so sorry for all of this.
[coughs] I will raise. [Dwight sighs and folds his cards] Thanks.
I mean, I don't even know what I'd do with all that money.
Yep.  Yeah.  She's blind, is that a problem?
Oh, um... Are you really mad about this?
You know I will. And by the way, seriously, we never, never do this!
Okay. I think the best thing to do right now is just come clean and tell everybody the truth.
[glances at Pam] Moms, primarily. Yep. Soccer moms. Single moms. NASCAR moms. Any type of moms, really.
We just wanted to say we are very sorry.
We called about a dozen customers, and they all said that they gave us great marks.
I mean, it's just that- [clears throat] You know, Pam and I are still dating, so, and, I just mean that things are going really well, so I didn't want to see... you...
You know, I just think you should know that-
I have never played squash. But I have seen it in countless 80's movies and it seems like the most common mistake is that you serve too hard and hit yourself right in the squash balls. So, as long as I don't do that, I think I'll be alright.
I mean, it could be you, Gabe. I mean, that's the point.
So as it turns out, unless you're a young child or a prison inmate, you don't need anyone supervising you. People just come in and do their work on their schedule. Imagine that - people like us allowed to sell paper. Unsupervised. [Darryl, Phyllis, Stanley, and Oscar are working while Andy and Ryan play on a foosball table] And yet, somehow it works. It must be because the stakes are so high.
How do you hate it? It's a cake.
It is... more of a spicy brown, actually.
Okay, it sounds sketchy, but it helps us get more money.
[holds up the retrieved lead] It involves you too.
Dwight left his cell phone on his desk. So, naturally, I paired it to my headset.
Well, he's not, though. So you just gotta suck it up. You just gotta move on. Try to have some fun. Come to my poker game tonight.
And Pam it was like three years ago so I am totally over it.
LOVE the hair. [Ryan walks up driveway with blonde dyed hair]
Hey, quick question: Do you shower at night or in the morning? Cause I wanna shower when you're showering. Save some water.
Uh, by the way. Have you heard Dwight say the word immunity, yet? Because if I can get Dwight to say the word immunity, it might be the greatest day of my life.
No, Pete is not the new Jim. The only we have in common is that neither of us wants to sit on Meredith���s face.  And if that  makes him the new Jim, then every human being in the world is the new Jim.
[shoe falls while climbing ladder] Oh. Ow. Ow. Ow. [grunts] Creed. I was never here, all right?
Okay, shhhh stop... stop whatever you're doing because this is going to be good.
If you were a real star you would put your face in it.
Sorry, man, I can���t focus on zingers. There���s too many potential clients.
I have an assistant now, who can help you with whatever you need. He is lazy, so crack the whip.
[cell phone rings] Excuse me, one second. Hi.
So four years ago, when I was in Stamford, Connecticut, and dating someone else, Pam went on two dates with Danny. Which was obviously the greatest love story ever told, given how much people are walking on eggshells around us.
[sees a pole poking out Dwight���s pant leg] What are you up to? Oops look out! [grabs Dwight's wallet]
[on phone]Uh, I don't know, let me ask. [to Dwight] Uh, were you quilled?
I don't know what I was so worried about. I have the best wife in the world.
Right, cause that's what we are talking about.
I have this conference call today with this company in Philly that I���m helping start. Ah, first board meeting. Also, the first time I���ve ever been excited about work. So, that feels... wrong.
For the record, I fought this. Alright? And now, I'm not really sure what we do.
Ok, if you don't want a gift, at least let me buy you a beer, or lunch or something.
Question, if we already fomented insurrection, may we be grandfathered in?
Which when it goes off it destroys everything. Very similar to a doomsday device.
No. You don't need the bathroom. You've got it. Go.
I���m sure you did not. What was your question?
Michael, wait. So they said we are sold?
But maybe I'm here for a reason, because I might have some good ideas, too. I've been sitting out there, and I've been learning a lot, and maybe I can just bring something different to the table.
But they shouldn't be much longer now, so we'll be back soon.
Hey, how am I doing as your desk mate, by the way? You probably miss Clark.
Ah, let's do it. [laughs] Oh, that's healthy.
Nnnno.  Uh, turns out, it was just a really bad idea involving fire.  But I think I fixed it.
Okay, this is the second time in two days that the website isn't working.  Do you guys know anything about it?
Okay. You know what would help is a pros and cons list for our options.
The three words I would describe you as is aggressive, hostile and definitely difficult.
[on phone] Nah that's alright. Spend money on her, instead of giving it to us. That's fine. No, I didn't even have a seat for you anyway. Yeah, hahaha, alright man, have a good night. Bye.
Okay, just to be clear, you're terrible at this and you are not equipped for espionage...
To be honest, I still can't believe he didn't call her back. Who doesn't call a dork like that back?
Cool. Thanks. [puts his hat on Erin's head]
You're not in it at all, because you can't be employee of the month, you're a manager.
No, no. Of course. Just one quick question. Was this um, Halloween, or...
You could���ve just called that an alliance too, right?
We definitely are.  At 3:00, right?  You said we could stay until 3:00?
Yeah. All right. Bye. [Kevin sinks putt] All right. Sorry, I got to annoy you one more time. What if I bring down shipping costs?
Okay. Let's start with the 'I love you' level.
You know what?  Maybe it's in the ceiling.
I don't know. This conversation really got away from me.
[hands Pam Andy's phone] Are there any messages?
[Jan enters the office, pushing a stroller] Jan.
Time to beat is one minute, 15 seconds. Here they come. [Michael and Dwight enter] Guys?
Okay, you know what?  I'm going to go give, uh, doctor Asmani a quick call.  He'd probably know...
Oh, Italian. Nice. Wow! You got the works there. Red onion, provolone...
Concussion. [Michael scribbles something out] What did you write?
We can relax. Let's get our Sweeney on.
[Pam is making copies and is struggling with the machine] You might want to consider changing teams, because we would-we would love to have you.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Ok. Yeah. We're not watchin' this.
Dwight, I really think someone's probably just playing a prank on you, so just go right through it.
I���m really sorry. Is there anything I can do, maybe pretend to be Chuck?
Yeah. She's really funny, and she's warm. And she's just... well, anyway.
Oh my God. We're going to have to re-name it then aren't we? [Dwight's phone rings. He crawls into nook under Jim's Quad-Desk]
OK.  You know what?  Here we go. [stands up] Uh, everybody?  I just want to make an announcement.  Pam and I are engaged.
I was going to use today to purge my inbox, but now something much more pressing has come up.
Good advice Beesley.  Thanks.  See you out there.
Nope, nope, nope, nope.  Come on, let's go to the hospital.  Pam, let's go to the hospital right now.
Let's just -- Let's head back to the desk.
Alright. [starts walking away, but returns] Oh, did you see my memo by the way?
You good?  I'm just checking on the other branches.  Michael wants me to do that from time to time, so...
No, no, no, no. Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Let's talk about this.
Okay. Uh, I don't. So are we good? [Jim leaves]
Oh, my god! It was the theme song to Boy Meets World.
Oh, yeah. You sold a lot, so it's lighter.
Don't worry about it. I have a thing. A thing of soup. Which I've been wanting to try.
[on the phone] Mr. Decker, we didn't lose your sale today, did we? Excellent. OK. Let me just get your... what's that? No, we didn't close last time. I just need your... Oh. W-What code were you given? Oh, OK. That's actually another salesman here. I can redo it if you want to do that. Oh, he gave you a discount? No, I don't blame you.
OK. [to Ryan] Wow, thanks for taking all the excuses, dude.
Great. Sounds awesome. Just have him pitch to you.
Oh, that's not advice. What advice sounds like is this: umm, don't ever bring your purple belt to work because someone might steal it. [reveals Dwight's purple belt]
Pam gets a little down.  Her toaster oven broke. Um, which she got at her engagement shower. Um, for a wedding that still has yet to be set... and that was three years ago.
[taking away Dwight���s handset] Go ahead David, I���m listening.
I had a little better reason to believe that... You're right. You're right. Well, you're not right, because Johnny Depp...
Uh, that is an invitation to an online party.
Andy, can I talk to you for a second?
[to Karen] Woah, stop, another hole. Take a big step. [Karen steps into lake] Yes!
Well, it saves time, you know. 'Cause we could just meet in the parking lot every morning. Walk in together. Perfect.
God, this is so sad. This is the smallest amount of power I've ever seen go to someone's head. Phyllis, can you believe this?
Nope. You're, you're doing a great job of it in my fantasy right now. [Pam sighs]
I don't get it. He's not even my boss anymore.
Michael, on Thursday I'm going to drive down and interview with David for the open position in New York.
Okay. I was wondering if you ever did any couple���s counseling.
[on the phone] Yeah, she's with the nurse right now, so you'll have to stall a little longer... No, don't send in the subs yet... Dwight, I don't know. Think of something!
Nope. Can���t accept that job. It���s not a real job.
This whole thing is making me very uncomfortable. I'm not getting between the boss and his wife so just ask me about something else. You know Stanley's tie is really the story of the day...
Chapter 9 ��� The tableau vivant is not only welcomed, but expected entertainment at any garden party.
[playing Call of Duty] Oh? Someone's left out in the open, taking a little siesta. Not smart. [shoots] Yes! Finally killed you... [Karen's desk is empty]
It's time for our first quarter camaraderie event, so pack a swimsuit, a toothbrush, rubber-soled shoes, and a ski mask.'
Nope. Your friends not turning out to be as great as you thought? Not even Gabor?
How about this? I think our goal should be we don't have meetings unless they're absolutely essential.
I mean, do you like it? You having fun? [Andy snorts, unsure how to answer] Tell you this, everybody else is having a lot of fun���.and you did that.
Um... I don't... Uh, yes, that time that it was very late. Uh, we'd had sex so many times already, I was exhausted...
Pam, no!  Are you nuts?  We're going to the hospital now.
[Creed takes toy from toy drive box.] Oh, I think you're supposed to put a toy
Oh, you know what? This reminds me, Cece needs a new toothbrush.
[to Dwight] All right. So... I guess this is it.
You can't yell out 'I need this, I need this' as you pin down an employee on your lap!
What if we just bring it up? We just put it out in the open?
Hey, uh, does Mr. Nortman still teach here? He's a jerk, right?
Okay, Pam. What song is running through my head right now?
The new assistant to the assistant to the regional manager is Dwight K. Schrute.
Wow. I tell you what, it's really strong. I can't wait to read the rest of it later and see how it ends.
[hovering over Meredith's desk] Oh, nice, wasting time, here we go.
Pam and I are good buddies.  I'm sort of Pam's go-to guy for her problems. You know with stuff like work, or uh, her fiance Roy. Or uh... Nope, those are pretty much her only two problems.
Oh, you know who might be good? Mike Tibbets.
No, I just... I heard something about that. It's just, I kind of put it all on the line. Twice, actually. And she said no. Twice.
Well that's not true. Other people believe it's deeper inside...
Well, I'm gonna to talk to Angela and we're gonna see what we can do about a pie.
All right, here we go everybody. May the manliest man win. Go.
[on the phone] Hey, where are you? Oh good. Yeah. We're just here, we're playing Desert Island. It's when you pick your five favorite DVDs...
Where do you want to go for dinner?
I've been driving stick since high school. So... yes. For a really long time that's all I had. I just had little moments with a girl who saw me as friend. And a lot of people told me I was crazy to wait this long for a date with a girl who I worked with, but I think even then I knew that... I was waiting for my wife. So...  I would like to propose a toast. So if you'd all raise your glasses. Not Pam, for obvious reasons, but everyone else. If you would raise your glasses--
Yes, I have not gotten one either. So, keep going.
Okay, he's not that good-looking. I don't understand why everybody's obsessed with this-
Well, either way. This is an amazing gift because it comes with bonus gifts. Look inside.
No. I can't. It was like, hours ago.
He's just mad that we're all having fun.
Jim Halpert, yep. So, um, just going to let you get back to it... [being pulled away by Pam]
Am I the only one who remembers what he did when he was in charge? I feel like I'm going a little bit crazy.
Got it.  They're like the penguins of the airplane family.
Whoops.  Is that really what Ryan wanted you to tell us?
Sure, that's true we can't compete with their prices. But let me ask you something. How important to you is customer service?
[a text tone goes off] Is that my phone?
Last week, Dwight sent out a memo about the dress code. So, this is me showing him that I'm taking it very seriously.
Pam and I are great. She just recently finished her mural for the Irish cultural center.
I was blue group, so it was second from the top.
It's Kurt.  Wow, I am so sad that I know that.
Guys, I think that seems a little unfair. I mean, I feel like we don't definitely know it was Andy.
Slowly, slowly.  Let's just get to the elevator.
Oh. Andy. I thought of one last tact you can take with Pam.
Pam really needed some help with the kids, so, I promise my intentions were good.
Alright, I'll look into it, but the answer's no.
Did it? It might have come up while we were waiting for you.
Dwight, you've really never stolen any company time?
You know what?  Let's just leave that image out of it, because this is a happy place.  Happy thoughts, Pam.  Happy thoughts.
And I have started a business in Philadelphia. [Pam shrugs]
We need to assume that everyone in the office is forming an alliance and is therefore trying to get us kicked off.
Not to mention the extra night's sleep in the hospital will be very nice because once we bring the baby home, if it's crying all night, one of us is going to have to take care of it.  And I do not plan on helping unless it's a boy.
So I was wondering if Karen and I could get off a few hours early 'cause we want to spend the night in the city.
Wow! I do not parent for the award but I gotta tell you It feels pretty good. Uh, Cece, if you're watching this at home it's way past your bedtime, by the way how'd this get televised?
Andy, nobody really expects you to go through with this���
Yeah.  Yeah. You know what? Maybe... maybe I will. [starts walking away]
I'm sorry, that just wasn't interesting to me.
You got this, Beesley. Actually, do you want me to come down and help you get started?
So this possible client they're talking about, actually a big deal.  It's Lackawanna County.  Our whole county.  And if we get this, they may not have to downsize our branch.  And I could work here for years.  And years.  [groan] Years.
[reading the screenplay] Inside the FBI, Agent Michael Scarn sits with his feet up on his desk.  Catherine Zeta Jones enters.
Will everybody stop for a second, because obviously I'm not taking any of it.  A mistake has been made and we'll figure it out.  Second of all, there was no cash prize.
Come on, Pam. Pam, I asked you if you could use the phone, and you swore that you knew how.
Okay. The annex it is. I���ll be sitting at your desk if that���s okay with you.
Yeah, you haven't seen that since 1983. That is amazing. Okay, we have to sign him. I'm gonna call the label, we're gonna...
It's my pleasure. [takes phone from Pam] Hello?  Well that's great. [hangs up phone]  Turns out the paper was there all along.
DJ Pam Halpert is spinning some serious Radio Disney tonight.
[On phone in hallway] No, I know I need to work, I just- I feel weird not being home.
Oh, that's so rude of me. Have you seen, um, Pam's new art? It's right there. Check it out. [closes door]
[collects Dwight's weapons from around the office; holds up a hand scythe]
Oh, I don't think that is what's happening.
Michael went in there with him too.  It's pretty sweet.
Okay, if it's all the same to you, I'm just going to take away 'Survival Skills' and 'Self-defense.'
[in women's bathroom] Well, I stand corrected. This is pretty cool.
Oh no, this is different. The CIA thing, that was a prank on Dwight. This is more like a umm... OK, it's pretty much the same thing.
In the box. [hits it straight into the floor]
Anything. [Dwight begins to fill his new purse] Good. Yup.
Yeah, it's not as fun if I'm not blowing off work.
Are you really sure we should be leaving?
I am not kidding. [shows camera an engagement ring] Got it a week after we started dating.
Okay, so you made a list, you checked it twice, and now you're gonna find out who's--
I'm excited, I've actually never been to Gettysburg. Uh, my family was gonna go once, but then my brothers convinced me if was full of dead soldier zombies, so I freaked out and we turned the car around. But I'm older now, I can outrun a zombie.
[in unison] I do not think that is funny.
I didn't say anything.  I was waiting to see what happened.
Not gravel, obviously. [both chuckle] No, things are good. Things are good. Got some stuff in the works. So-
So you're asking me to defend your honor against Kelly?
You have what is the national sport of Icelandic paper companies. And I'm blanking on the name, can you help me out Pam?
Yeah, cheese, or do we have other flavors?
Okay, so all we need is a theme... and cups, and ice, and punch, and a cake.
You know what? Here's the deal, Kelly. It would be really nice if he was in to you, right? It'd be great, but he isn't.
Well, you know you can't actually poison him.
Okay, as far as dinner tonight, cancel that, and please, for both our sakes, never, ever, ever see her again.
[at the Halpert residence as Cece twirls in the front yard, exiting front door] Pam, we gotta go. Cece, go back inside. Grandma���s got breakfast, OK? [to camera] We are going to Roy���s wedding. Yep, Roy. I think the only weird thing about going to your wife���s ex-fianc�����s wedding on a weekday at eight AM is that it���s your wife���s ex-fianc��.
Ok, well, that still leaves a 30% chance that I will attack you from the front.
Fifty percent of marriages end in divorce, so... it was her parents or my parents...
I don't know that we need to dissect it all now, but-
OK, OK, so you gotta hear this.  So, Jan's shower is going on right now, and she's singing 'Son of a Preacher Man' and everyone's just staring at her.
[Christian Slater impression] So you've been shown a nonsensical video. You're probably wondering, 'What's going on?' Well, you're not alone.
I ate a tuna sandwich, on my first day.  So, Andy started calling me Big Tuna.  ...I don't think any of them actually know my real name.
Come on, give me your hand. I'll help you down.
You want to just make a run for it?
Office romances. Um... [laughs] I think you should probably ask Pam 'cause she's in an office romance, technically.
Okay guys, here we go! We'll see you!
Phew! Can't wait for this day to be over.
Hey, Oscar, on these new expense reports, do we really have to go back to last quarter?
[raises hand] Question. Won't that interfere with your other task forces?
But I'll tell you this, if this works out, I think we're looking real good.
Is that really how you want to get this job?
Things are a little delicate with me and Pam right now. And if my working in Philly is gonna end up doubling the Dwight in her life, that���s only gonna make things worse.
[on the phone] Oh, Dwight, we're so close! Just buy us a few more minutes... Well, they just called me in for an update, so I'll call you right back... Okay... Okay, great. [goes into a private room where Pam and the doctor are, the voices are inaudible, but the camera can see through a window, Pam and Jim look in shock, they hug and Jim goes back out into the hall to call Dwight back, trembling] Hey, Dwight, uh... send in the subs! [laughs] Ohh! [goes back into the room to hug Pam]
[points to picture of Cecelia] We made that.
What about if we did an even newer voicemail message that had even more zing and pep?
[walks over to his desk and sees a present sitting on it, reading the note] 'Hey, Pickles, Merry Christmas. Open immediately. Love, Swiss Cheese.' [opens the present and a snowball shoots out at him, everyone laughs] Damn it, Dwight!
Hey, um... what has two thumbs and hates Todd Packer? [points at self] This guy!
Yeah. Which, don't get me wrong, can be a really fun distraction, but, when it's over, you're left thinking about the girl you really like, the one that broke your heart.
[overlapping with Pam] Really, all you had to do was play with her for, like, 30 minutes and then put her to bed.
Can I ask why you're leaving your current job?
[in the conference room] Hey Pam, can I see you for a second?  So, Dwight heard you were having a really rough day.  So he generously offered to wash our car.
Pam, meet Harvey. This is Michael's new friend.
Summers going great.  Just spent two hours listening to Michael Clump.  I have a weird pain in my left side that I'm convinced is an ulcer.  My girlfriend lives in New York and I haven't seen her in 10 days.  How's your summer?
Yeah, I know, I'd just like to settle in and get a good night's sleep.
I think it'll take you a little longer than that.
Yeah. Whoa. Here's one with his face whited out.
College rules (Cathy throws Jim the bag and Jim kicks Dwight)
Well, I promise you that has nothing to do with it.
I'm Jim. [Jim hi-fives Abby] Annnnd... let's sell some paper.
I know Pam better than anyone in this office, and obviously she's gone crazy, but everybody wants to say that I'm crazy.  But I'm not crazy, she's crazy.  I'm not crazy, she's crazy.  [reading from various books]  Five to seven minutes.  Five to seven minutes.  Six minutes.  Different, but not really.  Five to seven minutes.
How about this-- You let me take you to lunch, and I make my case?
Oh my god, I couldn't envy you more.
Oh no, I'm gonna push him. You know why? Because you're getting a pie. Why? Cause you deserve it. And what is he doing? He's trying to drive us all around the countryside looking for gas because he knows we won't get there. Is that what we want?!
I mean I guess-- I guess I could go down there and try to nudge them in the right direction.
Okay, so... three books on a desert island? Angela.
Yeah. Yeah. It���s a good thing we talked about it though, because we had to...
Kickoff. [to camera] My strategy is to touch the ball as little as possible. Chalk it up to teamwork. [to team] Alright! [clapping]
[Robert is looking at pictures of a house online] Whoa, looks pretty nice. Got a little bit of a Shining vibe, though.
Actually, you called me in here, but yeah.
No, it's hilarious, you're right. I just think, um, 'world's longest engagement', um, we're all expecting it, you know?
All depends on the conference room meeting itself. [phone chimes] Uh, okay.
Not even a thought!  It's not even that far away! I could still commute! Exactly. Exactly! Alright!
Ok. Well, hey, you're not here. You don't know, Ok? It's intense. They made me eat black licorice.
Okay, you need to think about it before you come with the... [Jim bites his lip again and pounds on table]
Pam never seemed to have a problem with us.
I like the wild card.  I'm already liking the wild card.
Wow, that's... really thoughtful of you, Dwight, thank you.
Now I have this big bump in my lip that hurts. I hate it.
Forget it. It's just a dry erase board.
Well, it's not a snowball, 'cause it's only a dusting. Right?
Do you like going out at the end of the week for a drink?
Two things I need you to understand. One, Pam and I are very happy together.
Oh, hey, Mee-Maw, would you watch Cece for a second? Don't worry. She's asleep. I'm just gonna track down some more chairs.
Let me show you what I mean. [Jim opens the closet door to reveal a work station] Your new office. How great is that, right? For a job well done. Well, not done.
Happy Holidays, Dwight. But do not open it till Christmas.
Guys, what is going on?!  [Pete and Tom burst out in laughter]
Oh, one hundred percent.  We all want to see you tattoo your ass.
I bike to work now. Saves on gas, cheaper than a vasectomy and, uh, oh, yeah, it���s good for the environment too.
Well... that's not gonna hold up in court.
OK. 'Cause the quote was, cut off your nose to spiderface.
I don't know. I feel like I have plenty of time to figure out the details but...
Yeah, we're slow-playing it because of our stupid HMO.
Yes, I can. [Cathy laughs] uh, all right. I'm really sorry. I think we'll just��� we'll just watch. You can watch, not watch, whatever you want to do. Take another shower, I don't care.
[laughs] What's wrong? You didn't have a good first day?
And his wallet and phone are on the seat next to me.
Ooh, I like where this is going. Unfortunately I have a lot of work today so I���m gonna have to hand this off to my number two. But, don���t worry, he���s the best in the biz.
Well, I tried to put all the birthdays together at once.
You know I majored in Public Speaking in College.
Damn, lost another file. Going to have to reboot. Again. [Windows reboot sound] Hey, Dwight, do you want an Altoid?
I have to go to philly. But this was amazing. Okay.
Oh, okay. Oh, do... that's what the tape is for. I didn't know.
Because the insurance company only covers two nights.
Yeah. I just feel like I got a bunch of stuff to do in Philly and I'm sure you have stuff to do. So we can just... I don't know, drop me at the bus station?
So, yesterday Dwight found half a joint in the parking lot. Which is unfortunate because as it turns out, Dwight
You know what? You should come with us. Because you know we're all going out and it could be a good chance for you to see what people are like outside the office. I think it could be fun.
Why did I talk to Jan about transferring? Well, you know... I have no future here.
Now he's trying to get me to bring my children in to work. I think it's fair to be cautious.
Okay, listen, all right? Dwight's on to us, he's going to figure it out really soon, so let's just get ahead of it, let's tell the truth.
Yeah, trust me, that would be fun for no one.
[slinking out of the room] Alright, you are welcome.  I'm going to go because of, um, traffic.
You've gotta stop with the hot chocolate stuff. I was thinking we can jam his drawers, so they only comes out two inches, then he can see everything in them but he can't get to them.
Yeah, was it 10? Yeah, I have it on a mix tape from junior high.
Today's a big day.  Today's the day that I show Pam the house that I bought for us. Without telling her. But it's my parent's house, the house I grew up in and yeah, I bought it kind of impulsively. I mean, the price was good and I was helping out my mom.  It's got shag carpets.  I mean you can't blame my parents it was the 70's.  And why would you want to buy ugly wood from trees when you can have paneling? And a painting of some creepy clowns that is apparently crucial to the structural integrity of the building. [tugs and pulls in vain at the clown painting]  She's gonna love it.  Right?
[Jim ejects a videotape from the VCR and puts in a new one] Wow. I don't know how you're gonna decide. They are all extremely good.
Absolutely. Or you could just be nice to your customers.
Uh, it's saying the server went down? Does Anybody know that password? 'Cause otherwise we can't do any work.
OK, I'll ta...I'll talk to you later. [hangs up]  That was a good story.
That's the best part. That represents a pillow, or a television.
Wait. You did say we could pool our points, right? In that case���let���s get to work.
Wow, that's weird. Oh, dollar for a stapler, that's pretty good.
We're best friends, actually. We're going wine-tasting next weekend, if you want to come.
Oh, and I forwarded his desk phone to mine.
Dwight, that's not necessarily true. Do you read GQ?
Least I didn't leave you at a high school hockey game.
Hey, you're supposed to hit the white ball first, buddy. Nice one. Can I talk to you for a sec? All right. Everything ok?
Thanks, Katy. Um, didn't really prepare anything to say. We're all caught pretty unprepared with this whirlwind courtship. I guess I just wanna say that Pam is the greatest. My best friend. And she's awesome. And...
I can't.  She's too strong.  She's, careful, though.  You don't want to break it.
No way. How do you confuse 28 Days with 28 Days Later?
We own our own delivery trucks. We could lease them out on the weekends --
We waited too long!  Two minutes doesn't do us any good.  Well, what happened to four and three minutes?
Yep.  A long time ago, but, I liked it.
I think she just didn't want a crucifix cake.
[sounds of a car crash] What was that...
Yep. That's exactly what my first thought was. And then I remembered having a conversation with him where he was like, 'I don't own an Ebay store,' so...
Dr. Johnson, we need you in surgery right away.
OK, I don���t have my pocket code chart on me, right now, so.
And... that is why we waited so long to tell people.
Come on. I don't wanna do that. I wanna be
[motions for her to follow him] Come on.
I don't know. Is it what you expected?
I���m sorry, we're taking work time to move someone's personal belongings into their new apartment.
If you stop crying, I'll stop writing it.
I saw the movie. I just don't know every line from the film.
We decided to have a Valentine's day lunch and then that way we can spend the entire night with Cece and avoid the Valentine's day dinner thing. It's a whole thing.
I think it's a cross between Dumbo and Jumbo, with a hint of chubby. It's not a name.
Okay, I'm sorry, why are we discounting this whole 'Woody came to life' thing so quickly?
Right in the sweet spot. I think you���re gonna be really happy.
Careful, whoa. First of all, it's not like I think that's going to help the Eagles win.
I think that's the question that you had...
What if he jumps out the window and runs away?
Ah. Why do you keep reading that garden party book? I mean, how hard are finger sandwiches and tea?
I don���t know. I���ve always wanted to own a bike shop, but what about you?
Probably the weirdest thing about Pam being gone would be lunch... actually.  But um, it will force me to become acquaintances with people I consider... coworkers.
No, I just saw I missed their call. Why? What���s up?
Hey oh, listen, um, I told Michael on the booze cruise. It's so stupid. Um, I told Michael that I had had a crush on you when you first started here.
[in the stairwell on his phone] Right. And did you show them the market? Yeah. And what'd they say? That's awesome! That, oh my god! Wow!
And two, that stuff that happened with you and Angela is a bummer, and I know you don't think you're ever gonna find someone else, but you will. I promise you, you will.
And you went to New York to do this.  So when you come back you come back the right way. Right?
Yeah, you don't have to, ummm.  Alright, yes, that's not gonna be awkward at all.
Andy, it's the last day of the quarter. We've already called all our clients, so making that much in a day is going to be tough.
Another bullets heads towards Agent Michael Scarn, but he jumps out of the plane without a parachute.
Okay, I'll just go get the other guy.
Perhaps your year of experience managing this branch will come in handy.
But there is a reason why I'm here!
Course, it's on every Thursday night, so how could I miss it?
No, I don't think we should be trying to make this place seem unpleasant. I think we should let this place just crush her spirit by itself. I mean, it knows what it's doing.
OK, listen, we need to assume that everyone in the office is forming an alliance and is therefore trying to get us kicked off.
Oh. Adorable, right? [opens kiddie bathroom, sees man on toilet] I walked in on someone in the bathroom.
Hey!  Just in time!  You wanna go on the group tour? We were just about to leave.
So this is my life.  Until I win the lottery [laughs].  Or Pam finally writes that series of young adult books.
I think you mean the aid to Afghanistan.
Okay, you could just say you don't know what's going on.
Absolutely. Yeah. [whispers] Call it off, Pam. Call it off, okay? It's way more complicated than you think. Cancel the magician. Trust me.
[laughs] Just like now....too bad the schools are terrible.
Can I just say something?  I know that tempers are high, but I think the best way to handle this might be to just talk to Michael directly.
You know what I think we should do? I think we should just save the goodbyes for tomorrow. At lunch.
[time has obviously passed, as everyone is gone except Jim and Dwight] Four hundred and ninety-four months?
What if we went all the way up to five hundred points?
Great.  I will do that.  Sorry, Pam, I just feel a little bit frazzled.  And you know how very rarely I use that word.  Frazzled.
Pam made a drawing of Lloyd. He is a blend of all the salesman. [shows sketch]
Now how do you know how it works?
I think I���m a little too busy these days to s--- [whispering] Oh ,my God. I did send Dwight on a quest for the Holy Grail.
Let's go driver! [clapping] Laverne packs up the pie wagon at five so...
Will you stop? Stop it, stop it. Here's the story-they need Meredith somewhere else asap, okay?
Well it's not too late, because you haven't done anything.
Okay. There���s no possible way I can get there, so just ask Phyllis. She can be your older sister or something.
Um... let's see, uh...  The customer. Because the customer is king.
[speaking into the mallard and looking a Dwight] Hi buddy.
I don't really know Ronnie. But I have a feeling I will get to know her very well over the next few years, and eventually declare my love for her.
I started biking into work. Josh does it and he lives a lot farther away than I do. And also it saves gas money, keeps me in shape... helps the environment. And now I know it makes me really sweaty for work.
I'm sorry, are you advocating that I use it less?
Is this real? [Pam dumps Michael's screenplay on Jim's desk]
It was very clear that ten thousand was what we had...we should talk about it later.
How about this one - 'When arrogant salesmen are mean to my face, a certain manager will go to his moppy place.'
[to Karen] Woah, stop, stop, stop. There's a hole. Step over the hole.
Last week, my company in Philly lost a big investor, so we���re scrambling to find new funding. Luckily, my partners have a fix ��� me asking the boss of the company I���m abandoning to give us a gigantic influx of cash.  So��� problem solved. Thanks, guys.
Ah, this is just me and David, if that's okay.
What are you gonna do about it? There's no shotgun, so... free at last, free at last!
She's wearing a onesie [holds out his cell phone, Oscar leans in but Kelly grabs his arm]
No, no, I had to. Look, I needed to look like a team player, Pam.
Oh well, 'Yoy' should bring in 'Long Tim' in one day. Shouldn't he?
He obviously forgot to get me something, and then he went in his closet and dug out this little number [holds up way-too-short sleeves] and then threw it in a bag.
[Jim and Dwight sitting next to each other in talking head interview] Go ahead.
Can I just talk to you for one quick second?
You two are so evenly matched I don't know how one of you is going to get the upper hand.
[on phone] Well, I really appreciate the offer, but I'm just happy the way things are. Okay. Thank you. [to Pam] That was Jo, asking me if I wanted to take over as acting manager while they find a replacement. I told her... I don't want to mess this up, right? There's a consensus, people are happy.
Hey it's me. So uh, don't worry. Everything's ok.
Plus you have so much more to talk to this girl about, You're both um, salesmen. I mean that's something right there.
Basketball? It was kind of my thing in high school. And I'm, yeah, I'm looking forward to playing. You know, I think I'm gonna impress a few people in here.
Well, yeah I don't want to see her get physically harmed, that's for sure.
Alright. I just got out of the shower, I'll be one second.
Remember that time that I helped you do your laundry and that crazy guy came in and started yelling at you?
No, because the office isn't what I'd consider a romantic place.
Yeah, I'm late for work, so I have to brush my teeth, it's a whole routine.
Oh, this coming from the guy who still uses a children's toilet? Why didn't you just lock the door, man?
So, who will be challenging Kevin in Flonkerton? Anyone?
I really don't know how it happened, David.
That's it? That's all I get? Even after all the hard work I put into celebrating your talent today?
Nice.  That's excellent, because bugs love my famous grilled cheese sandwich.
[Pam starts nodding in agreement] Why are you nodding?
Hey, do you guys have any other games?
[laughs and swings his arm out which doesn't come close to touching the reception desk] I'm always this close.
Well, since I have no incentive to sell, I've cleaned my car, organized my desk, and taken a multivitamin. So... what now?
That���s exactly what I was doing. Plop, what animal am I picturing?
He can do the same for you. Right now. By getting fired instead of you. So what are you gonna do?
[coughs] Oh, big one! Big one! Really big one!
So, uh, if you just take a look at this, and then that���ll print out���Hey. Meet your new desk mate.
Michael has asked Pam and me to dinner at least 9 times. And every time we've been able to get out of it. But I've got to give him credit, he got me. Because I'm starting to suspect that there was no assignment from corporate.
Wait, wait. I didn't transfer because of you. You're a good boss. You're a great boss.
Darryl! We all know you. Your interview is not nearly as important as the other guys. [Darryl taps a couple times on Jim's desk and walks away]
I can't believe you guys.  I'm not going to go further piss off my ex-girlfriend.
Wow! You are a downer. We were having a pretty nice day.
[Dressed as Dwight] It's kind of blurry. [puts on his glasses] That's better. [exhales] Question.  What kind of bear is best?
Hey, quick question.  If I take a pizza, do you think you could take some sodas and some napkins up to the roof?
He's good at his job.  And I like working for him.
Well - who? How did you? Who, who told you this?
Okay, guys, guys, guys. That almost sounded like business, and we are trying to focus here today, okay?
Yeah. I mean, I'm not saying that everyone has to fall in love, or anything, I'm just saying... but you know, to not even call her back is...
No more than a week.  Maybe two weeks.
It's not--- It's not about me.  I mean, this your dream.
The Search Committee finally decided, after a lot of deliberation, on Robert California��� for the manager position. Who took one look around and left.�� He drove down to Florida and convinced Joe to make him CEO... CEO... her own job. He talked her out of her own job. And I don���t really know how someone does that. But, anyway, then the position was his to fill.���� And he chose���
A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh...
Pam? Did I ever have a 'thing' for her? No, why? Did she say something?
���Got your text, awesome idea. Let's hit the links next time you're in PA��� Dash JH.
Uh, it has to be a book, Dwight.
Do you know the industry is in decline?
Well, you seem to have this under control.
[to camera] Who is this guy? We are killing it.
Are you not gonna put out the torches?
Uh, I think you dropped this [hands over piece of paper]
It is transfer, extension, and then transfer again.
That's a good one. [a red sports car drives up] Whoa, Stanley! Did you just come back from burning down a rival nightclub?
I knew it. Oh man, just like that huh?
Oh God, I've been playing Zombie Soccer for two hours?
Oh, did the press ask for a story?
The Dunder Code! I completely forgot about that prank. That had to be like six or seven years ago. Stayed late every night for a month. Had a lot more free time back then.
[on voicemail] Hey, it's Jim.  Leave a message.
And I found out that there's a bus at 5:00 a.m.
You stay here and have fun, because I'm going to go out back and shoot hoops with David Wallace.
It's a bold move, to Photoshop yourself into a picture with your girlfriend and her kids on a ski trip with their real father. But then again, Michael's a bold guy. [Towards unseen cameraman] Is bold the right word?
Love me, say that you love me. Fool me, fool me, go on and fool me.
I can't believe this place is real. I mean, I've heard about his beet farm for years, but wow.
If I left, what would I do with all this useless information in my head? You know? Tonnage price of manila folders? Um, Pam's favorite flavor of yogurt, which is mixed berry.
Duh- Wait. I just feel weird. I should just call him.
I love you.  Okay, I gotta--I gotta go!
[quietly] If you get promoted, and if you haven't fallen in love with me by then.
All right, nice meeting you, Ted. Take care.
Well we are here now, so let's just--
Wow. What a terrible day to not be able to talk.  Dwight was literally carrying around his own urine and dressed like one of the Village People. Why does he do the things that he does for Michael?  I just don't get it. What is he getting out of that relationship?
You're right, we didn't dance.  It was more like, swaying.  But still romantic.
[ignoring Dwight] All right, guys, good day, a lot of candidates. Let's discuss.
Okay. I���ll see you in a little bit.
[notices cleaning crew coming up to the gate] Cleaning people. Oscar. [everyone starts to walk outside] OK, so all you need to do is explain to them what happened, 'cause I think they can help us.
Okay.  I know, I know.  But my iPod is in the go bag.  We'll be fine.
If it's the same thing, then why did you write 'workspace'?
[Michael playing air guitar on pool table] Wow. Maybe we should tell her that he's not normally like this.
Binghamton branch closed last night and their clients are up for grabs.
Great.  Hey, how do you feel about starting an Employee of the Month program?
Are you really gonna marry him?  [Pam nods] ...Ok.
Okay, that's insanely complicated and the first thing I'm going to do is erase it.
Why don't you just, privately, in your own head, think of it like a meeting.
What are you talking about? We--we have a commission cap?
I think I got a pretty good sense of that one.
[opens door to Gabe's office] All right, good night, Gabe. Just wanted to say thanks again. [Gabe motions that he's on the phone] 'Cause I really think I made good use of my day, oh! Sorry.
I've had a Foreman grill for about six years, I've done about 85% of my cooking on it, but I've never burnt myself, probably because I don't use it as a pillow.
[leaving his desk for the day, pretends pull the pen out of a pretend grenade, and tosses it to Karen]
Ah, good. Good luck. Doing good. [goes to the index cards and writes another race down]
I did. From you. You gotta stop telling people.
Oh, come on, Pete! God, that���s just sad. If he doesn���t watch himself, he���s gonna be here for years, doing nothing. [sober realization] Wow, maybe Pete is the new Jim.
Yes!  So close.  I really love the paper triangle flicking and hitting things game.  Yeah.
So, I dunno, I just feel likes we've been dating a month, right? Same street. I think that might be a little close. A little much.
Okay. [walks out of conference room] Okay, guys, just so you all know, no decision has been made, and Dwight is definitely not the boss.
I don���t know what to tell you, man.
No, this is instead of the boycott. Yeah?
Okay. Just trying to get some advice on my trip.
Hey, it's Jim. Listen, this is important. Are you busy?
Okay, but we are leaving at five minutes apart.
David, I know that I'm very new at this, but I have a very good perspective on how things work.
All I'm saying is that it's a first dates, so just keep a respectful distance.
Are you ok? Are you sure you are alright?
Pam!  You don't think he'll mind if we take the shampoo, do you? [holds up large bottle]
[interrupting] Alright. Well, enjoy the red licorice, and good riddance, right? [tosses black licorice into trash]
It's still on a bike path though right?
[sitting on a stack of paper] Yeah, well, if you're only free till three on Sunday and I can't get there till one, then it's gonna be pretty tight.
I think you just gotta ride this one out, man.
Fact.  Bears eat beets.  Bears.  Beets.  Battlestar Galactica.
And I spend hours thinking of ways to get back at him, but only in ways that could get me arrested. And then here he comes and he says 'No, Jim, here's a way.'
[back to Pam] Actually, you know what? Give me one second, okay? Make yourselves at home.
Do you have any reason to believe that Kelly would be mad at me?
How embarrassing is it? That's not fair. Here...
Okay.  That is me, but I didn't order the cake.
At thinking out the options, and then stating that decision very clearly, especially when it's an unpopular decision.
It���s just a list of our names, split into two columns.
Oh. It's your go-to therm. Oh, man. That's a bummer. I'm sorry about that.
God, I don't even, I don't even know how to explain this. Uh, um... Dwight, uh, asked me to be in an alliance. And then um... um... we were... we've just been messing with him. Uh, because of the whole alliance thing. Um...
Sure.  Oh, you know, while I have you... today I was working on this pitch for a supermarket chain, and it would actually be a big account and I wanted to-
I think if you ordered hot food you're allowed to eat.
Now, this is the projection over three months?
Alright now, I'm gonna warn you. Don't freak out, okay?
You're only engaged once.  Well present company excluded, but.
Hey, you know what? I got you a cake.
No shame in that. Get it all out in the open.
So... I think, yeah, I think getting these out of the way might be productive.
[front door slams, Kelly walks by] Hey, Kelly.
[Turns off Dwight's music] Whether it's this time or next time.
So some of the co-workers were thinking of going out tonight, but I told them-
Would you do me a favor and connect me to Ryan?
What? He never called you? I thought you said it just fizzled.
No kidding. And I am just going to lie down in the back, if that's all right.
Well, I can't tell you cause it's a secret.
Well, I like pretty women who have the appearance of intelligence.
No, that is a terrible idea, don't do this.
Oh, no. Don't worry about it. I was just gonna put a couple keys on it every day until Christmas. Then his pants would have fallen down, which was a little gift to me, but...
[Walks back into The Office] Yep, I did say that.
Ever since Pam and I started dating, I just feel weird asking her to make copies for me. So, I make my own copies. And that copier sucks. Let me tell you, I-But you know what? Pam and I don't have to agree on everything.
Okay, so close call at second. Was there an infield fly?
Yeah, I just moved it an inch every time he went to the bathroom. And that's how I spent my entire day that day.
I sold paper at this company for 12 years. My job was to speak to clients on the phone about quantities and types of copier paper. Even if I didn���t love every minute of it, everything I have, I owe to this job. This stupid���wonderful���boring���amazing job.
Alright.  Wait, what are you planning on doing?
Clark ended the whole thing with a karate demonstration. Did you know there was a belt above black?
We are doing a haunted house this Halloween. Which is actually kinda spooky because, as legend has it, on this very site there used to be a productive paper company.
- two percent milk! What I forgot for the coffee.
Hey you know what? Do you have a rundown that I could take a look at, just so I know what type of rundown you're looking for ?
[picks up tape recorder and speaks into it] Dwight Schrute is now wearing a baby's bonnet.
Ever since I was a little kid, like, eight or nine, I could sort of control things with my mind.
Michael, it's Phyllis. We want Phyllis as Santa.
[holding Cece] Spinach in a can. Power eat spinach. [Popeye sound]
Its sports marketing basically. But the athletes are partners.
I [drops out] at the Bermuda Triangle. An-  M-  please don't call again.
You really think you can make it up to me with food?
Ah, we're gonna go tonight, but we're gonna see you there tomorrow morning, right?
Listen, this isn't a favor, all right?  This is a good idea. We all win.
What is going on? And where's Andy? And what is going on?
Okay, Oscar, I'm not saying you're not dreamy, because you are, but isn't it possible that he was just schmoosing a voter?
Okay, you could just show up late though.
Will you let me know when this whole seminar thing's over?
I said forget it. [drop kicks lunch across room, stomps on it]
No, it was before I knew you so, its fine.
Yes... my pretty hardest. Look, you haven't dealt with him in awhile, all right. He's like super Dwight. It's like he's been bitten by a radioactive Dwight, or som- Stanley, back me up.
That's pretty funny. Hey you know what? Did I drop my, uh...
No. There's no extra outfit in the bag.
Alright, I will, um, I'm just gonna let you get back to that.
Chapter 4 ��� One of the host's most important duties is as Dance Master. A proper courtly dance sets the tone for the entire afternoon.
Michael, I'm just terrible at all this stuff, so that's really cool.
I was in Jamaica, and I got lost, and it was getting dark this one night and then out of nowhere with a cart and he's selling these. Dwight he's telling me things about myself that there's no way he could have known.
Sure I'm a little nervous, but doing our work will make us feel better.  I only slack off when things are good.
What are you talking about? You're the one terrorizing me.
Ah, nothing, just hauling some cube with Dwight.
I mean, you were gonna do this without me?
Yeah, definitely didn't need help with that, but, yeah.
I'm sorry, are you saying that Meredith was drunk at 9 AM?
Yes, I am brining my kids in to help me get out of this hole. And you all remember my beautiful wife, Pam.
[phone] Oh, hang on one second. Jim Halpert.
I thought you said you were inventing diseases? That's spontaneous dental hydroplosion.
No, you're right. And, and I'm not mad at Brian. And to be honest, I probably don't have any reason to be mad at all because I wasn't there. So, let's just forget about it.
Can't believe his mom dressed him like that, that's the real tragedy.
Michael just called the pizza place with a list of demands.
[Pam walks over to him and smiles excitedly while bouncing, Jim imitates her] Can I do something for ya?
No, it's because you also have a lot of weaknesses, Michael!
When I think of it like that, I do not think of the other connotations.
No! My wife does not believe in ghosts.
You're not the manager even in your own fantasy?
Ok, I didn't actually major in Public Speaking. But, I did download speeches from some of history's famous dictators. Like this one [holds up paper]. Originally given by Benito Mussolini.
[after a pause] That didn't happen. You would've told me right away.
Dwight is... special. But, I don't believe that his talents are being used in this office. So Pam and I have put his resume on Monster.com, Google, Craig's List. We're really interested most in jobs that take Dwight out of state. Um, preferably Alaska... or India.
Hey man. I am so sorry about that.
[after Pam checks her cell phone] What's going on?
[to camera] Michael's my only friend left in the office. Except Pam... I think. Is she still upset?
Pam, I couldn���t get out. I barely made it out just to make this phone call.
We don���t need a warning signal, Kevin. We can see him right there-
Whoa, whoa, whoa, game face, baby, game face.
Pam is staying late tonight to uh, achieve her dreams. So I'm pretty proud of her, unfortunately she was my ride home.
I'm gonna drive you up to the lake, give you a whole week on the water. Just you, me and the kids.
A good assistant knows what their superior is thinking before they even think it. Meredith, what number am I thinking of right now?
It's a great idea Kev, I don't think it applies here though, so maybe we just-
Ok, so that's a disaster. Luckily have a two-part plan. One, run. Two, hide. It's pretty smart, right? [walks into Vance Refrigeration office] Hi, how you doing? I'm Jim Halpert from across the hall. We are redoing our supply closet and I was wondering if I could take a look at yours for some ideas.
I knew it. You designed a uniform for Dunder Mifflin.
So I'm going to go ahead and save you some time, and tell you that no-one's going to go along with this. But you knew that, right?
Well, it was redacted. Look, if she wants an invite, maybe she's just trying to be friends.
Nope.  Just... [Deangelo continues staring at him] Okay. [gets up and leaves office]
Really? Do it. I am a big, stupid goofball.
Today is Thursday.  But Dwight thinks that it's Friday.  And that's what I'll be working on this afternoon.
[naked from chest up] Oh, I'm sorry, is this a working office, and not a French beach?
Yeah, that's the thing. I don't know if you can even give raises.
I don't know. I thought that was a little weird. You told me Brian got fired for the whole warehouse thing. And you intentionally left out a kind of major, intimate detail. I don't know, Pam, I guess I just feel like a chump. Who knows less about his marriage than the sound guy.
Yeah, they don't ever talk about careers that were made because of unplanned pregnancies.
Alright. Here's the thing okay, you just keep talking to her.  If you hit a stall you have a perfect fall back.
So I caught everyone before they left and I told them my idea, and they loved it. Because this is a group that respects good ideas... the one time a year they hear one.
No, it does matter who ends up sitting next to Pam when I���m gone. The people around you are basically who you end up spending your life with. I mean, because of where my desk was, I spent all those years looking at Pam, and I fell in love. So, that stuff matters. Definitely does.
Uh, I think we should just drop it... 'cause obviously he doesn't want to talk about it.
Okay. All right, come on. [picks up Cece from Pam, whispers to her] Where are we going? Where are we going? We're gonna take a little field trip.
[In the parking lot, holding his side, walking to the taxi, Pam follows] Oh...what was that? Now I'm gonna be all whipped for my first day at work. God. [To taxi driver] One second. Oh...
Why don't we head in your office to talk?
Greatness is only skin deep, some people say...
What the heck? Is that, uh... [bends down, cuts phone cords with scissors]
All right!  [sitting down behind Michael's desk] I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be doing, but...
[takes her hand] Hey.  You look just as I imagined you would.  Pam, you're so pretty.
Oh, 'cause I don't want my feet to get burned.
Dad, remember, no mention of the baby, right?
I could have prevented that. So I have to talk to Wallace.
Yup, Phyllis called me Michael. And I will always and forever be haunted by that fact.
[turning around to Karen] Wait, are we playing teams?
What? [looks in box] Oh my god. Where did you have time to make that?
Will you just talk to them, please? Pam just knew!
Yup. [Karen takes a big step] Perfect, oooh, just made it. OK, turn left.
[stammers] I'm sorry, is, is this because I talked to Wallace about your website? Because I really didn't mean to go over your head.
It's Mose. Who do you think it is?
[Dwight falls onto the couch] Stop, stop, stop, stop.
Ok, look. I know you are giving this speech on your own
You are gonna crush it. Wow, I missed you.
All right, let's get started. Umm... Oh, first off, we're supposed to be pushing cardstock this week. So... let's push cardstock this week. Uh, also... [to Dwight] what is this?
Alright, well, we're never leaving the house again.
Gross! Don't lick my hand! God, why is there so much saliva?
Alright. Well we'll be there in ten minutes.
[as Dwight prepares to throw dirt in his face] I'm sure... I'm sure she's in a better place.
[Irish accent] Angela's Ashes, top o' the morning to us.  Frankie's prose is funnier than a pot of gold, say I.
Sorry, I forgot Kevin's extension. It's a fantasy football thing.
Pam, are you really gonna listen to his stupid homemade test?
OK. Dwight, I'm sorry, because I have always been your biggest flan.
[both laugh] You know that I was doin' this.
Lead off with that. She loves hunting. She also loves those ads for Six Flags, with the old guy. [Andy hums Six Flag ad] Got it. Also... do you speak pig latin?
You know what, just in case she's looking you should put some stuff in it.
Speaking of which, I meant to tell you. Very impressive, the uh, donation you gave to Oscar's charity. What was it? 25 bucks?
Okay, I'm just gonna go get some ice.
Oh my god. Phyllis, coming alive. I like it.
And who cares?  It's a stupid veil, right?
Dwight, how about this? Instead of boycotting, you and I, together, go down to that store and we teach those snobs a lesson.
And even though... I came back, I just, I feel like I've never really... come back.
No, it's just I'm not sure if I um... well to be quite honest with you, Jan, I have a few unpleasant memories of Scranton. And um...
[Michael give Jim a 'World's Best Boss' mug] Thank you.
You know what, let me give you a call right back. I'm going to uh, find it and then I'll call you back, thanks.
Do you want to watch the game with us? We're watching a game. The Heat game. Just a game.
Michael, look I'll just be honest with you.  Earlier today I spoke with Wallace about a promotion.  I actually think that talk went really well.  And then after he spoke with you, for some reason it felt like things had changed.
[on phone] You gotta do something, man. You can't just sit there.
Um, I was laying on the ground, defenseless, and uh, he just kept throwing 'em until he exhausted himself. And, uh, [cell phone chimes] then... [reading text message] 'How 'bout icing it? lol. Dwight.'
No, I would like to get back to work, actually, please.
Are you sure you can keep this under wraps?
Did you get that? Please tell me you got that. This is all going to be on.
I've never been a kiss up. I - it's just not how I operate. I mean, I've always subscribed to the idea that if you really want to impress your boss, you go in there and you do mediocre work. Half-heartedly.
���Gotta go! Darth Vader's launching a huge attack.���
No, it's not, because you don't really work here.
I think that was sconesy cider, noted baptism reception critic.
You know, Dwight, this whole search for the assistant thing���none of these people are good enough.
Uh, I will have the chicken piccata with a side salad.
Oh, sorry. It was just -- it was right here.
Yeah, I'm aware of that.  But he's also being super annoying.  And I'm not a perfect person.
Cece���s ballet recital is today. I cannot wait. I���ve been working with her on her move. It���s called the Cece Spin and Kiss. Do you want to see it? It���s kind of like this. It���s pretty cute, right?
Why? When I look in the mirror, I don't like the face that looks back.
Oh, it's just a social club. You know, like the French Revolution, or the Black Panthers, or communism. It's just a club. Guys talking, you know.
Yeah. Gotcha. Of course. I'm gonna dive in. To the rundown. I'll be exhausted 'cause it's like a triathlon. [At door.] Do you want to close this? Close, or keep it?
He has not stopped working for a second.  At 12:45 he sneezed while keeping his eyes open, which I always thought was impossible.  At 1:32 he peed, and I know that because he did it in an open soda bottle under the desk while filling out expense reports.  And on the flip side, I have been so busy watching him that I haven't even started work.  It's exhausting, being this vigilant.  I'll probably have to go home early today.
Yeah, I'm not going to talk about this now.
Pam's on vacation and she gets back tomorrow, so it'll be nice to see her.  It'll be nice, and, uh, she set a date for the wedding with Roy.  Uh... June.  Summer.  So, that'll be nice.  And that's that.
[enters] Okay, so the consensus was that that was unique. They���re going to make you pay for the fish, and��� they wanted to know when you can start.
All right, guys. It didn���t work out for any of us, so��� we���re still on the same team. Let me get these.
I'm so sorry. These must be very painful memories.
Hey man, I never got a chance to thank you... for stopping Roy.  Thank you.
That is good. That's it. That's what it is.
Uhh, a little bit. It's a lot of pressure, you know, but that's what I signed up for right?
I am leaving early today for Philly, because tomorrow is the first day of my new job. So I figure I'd get in at 5:00, check into a hotel at about 6:00 so I can get a real good night of restless sleep and nervous puking.
Oh no thanks, I think Karen and I will take my car.
Guys, we cannot do these performance reviews, okay? If we go into them, you're basically accepting Nellie as your manager, and trust me, you do not want her as your manager.
I wonder, in this office, who has access to a porcupine?
Huh. How long would it take me if I drove 300 miles an hour?
Oh yeah.  Wait 'til you get to know her better though.
I feel like a stranger in my own country.
Look, I'm at the supermarket, and they only have numbered candles. How old is she?
Dwight. If you could travel anywhere in the world where would you go?
Oh! Of course there is. Hey, Chinese tonight?
All in favor of the baskets full of chocolates, teddy bears, and balloons? [all but Dwight raise their hands]
Michael, I thought we discussed that we would rather you not speak, like, at all. Because it's just going to be blood relatives, I think.
[ambulance pulls away in parking lot] Now what?
No, I mean, you guys really seem to have a strong connection.
You know what, I am really slammed, trying to catch up on everything here and I know that Michael's slammed too. So, maybe we should do this when things are a little less crazy.
This is actually a big potential sale, so...
Then let's just not do this. Do you have any idea the risks involved?
Guys, listen.  This was anonymous, all right?  There is no way I could've given it to myself because I didn't even know who was on here.  I just gave it to the employee with the highest overall score.
The one I have. I'll use the one I have.
We still doing the gifts today? [Pam nods] I mean, it is the Christmas party. Well, the classy Christmas party.
So, you got the signal from the third-base coach. You know what I'm saying? Like if there was a fly out to deep right, you know. A runner on second. He tagged up, didn't he?
Oh you had said that you don't do anything personal during work time so... I'm just making sure.
I���m talking to him this afternoon, but don���t get your hopes up.
What I���m about to say makes no logical sense, and yet, it might be the most logical thing I���ve ever said.
This is a very good idea. This is good. Let's get all the bad ideas out now. Flush them out.
There.  Now we're even.  [Pam laughs and mimes taking a picture, they kiss]
Quick phone call from you guys, keep going,
My name is Jim Halpert and I am a sales rep, which is a very important job. Um, without me dozens literally dozens of small businesses would go paperless.  They would have to write on their hands, or bed sheets, or who knows you know. Total chaos, total chaos. I mean or they could get their paper somewhere else. Staples maybe. I don't know.
Okay, Michael, I thought we agreed to not take up people's time with meetings like these.
Why don't you run the meeting? You play with dolls.
I did have a chance to think about it, but then I thought about something else.
Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go over there and I'm going to talk to him and I guarantee you he gives out his cell phone to everybody.
It's still happening right now actually, so uh...
Truthfully, it wasn't the way he fell in. It was... how long it took him to get out.
Story's kinda bland.  It's about this guy named Dumbledore Calrissian who needs to return the ring back to Mordor.
No, we definitely can talk about it in the next--
Okay. Are you sure you know how to do video on the phone?
[shakes Michael's hand] Thank you. [Dwight looks disappointed and angry behind them]
Well, turns out he actually made it up there.
Nope, not a prank. I think it���s time for you to bury the hatchet.
[telephone ringing] [shows note to camera 'It's OK. She'll call back!']
Yep, I used to play soccer in school. From second to fourth grade. I was on the orange team.
Let���s not get crazy and ruin our no-nonsense streak, all right? So, for instance, if you���re expecting a fax today, please don���t yell out, ���Michael J. Fax from Fax to the Future.��� Ok? That���s nonsense.
The KGB will wait for no one! [Michael laughs]
Yeah [laughs and then notices camera] Not that they're not smart people.
Wow, that's- that's a little rude. What's your deal?
Eck!... Oh! Also, it is Thursday, but Dwight thinks it's Friday.  So, keep that goin'.
My job is to speak to clients on the phone about... uh, quantities and type of copier paper. You know, whether we can supply it to them. Whether they can pay for it. And... I'm boring myself just talking about this.
Yeah. It's weird being away from them. Never done this before.
Hey, Dwight, I don't know if you heard, but we're supposed to be drinking out of weird backpacks instead of cups, like regular people.  Oh, you did hear.
If I had thought that there was a real chance that Dwight would be permanent manager, I would have pre-quit. And you might be saying to yourself, 'Well that's pretty premature to think,' but I always say, it's better to be pre-pre-preprepared.
I had this huge spider in my baseball mitt.
Okay, calm down.  Where was the last place you saw it?
OK. Three hundred boxes of twenty pound white. That's seventy-five boxes per person, so that's not so bad.
Well, it was nice meeting you guys. Take care.
Wait, so are you... you like heart-shaped jewelry, though, right?
Yeah, I didn't think I had.  Well, it was all about Pam.
Ah, ah, ah. Where's the 'please'? We're not animals.
Well, we were just looking for Ryan, so he's not here.
Yeah. Can I see it when I get back?
Closed. [Michael leaves his office, gives Jim two thumbs up, which Jim returns]
[watching baseball game on TV] Some girl came into Pam's room crying about her roommate stealing her soy milk. So I'm in here waiting it out.
What?  I did not do that.  That sounds disgusting.
No, no, no, seriously, I'll be in the back.
I'm sorry, wait, so is the question 'How'd I get to be so awesome?' [laughs] Because, I don't have an answer for you. [laughs]
Hey, how you doing? Jim Halpert, sales. Just wanted to say, if you need anything, let me know.
[on phone, leaving a message] Hey, Ryan, it's Jim. Look man, I don't know what's gotten into you lately, but you know what? I really don't care, because you're trying to get rid of me. And I bet you don't think I care enough about this job to actually fight back, but you're wrong, because I do, and I will. So you can keep trying to push me out of this place, but guess what? I'm not going anywhere. [hangs up and exhales sharply]
fool me, fool me, go on and fool me. Love me,
Get in the car? [Jim and Pam get in the back seat]
Good. I like it. You know what. Pretend to smoke. [Dwight pretends to smoke]
Really wish you would have told me the new boss was coming today.
[to babysitter] So... how do you guys know each other?
Yeah, well. Yeah, OK. Well, then thank you. Thanks to both of you.
Oh my God, that's right. I read in People magazine that he was looking for a two-bedroom condo in Scranton.
Michael and Jan seem to be playing their own separate game and it's called 'Let's see how uncomfortable we can make our guests' and they're both winning. So I'm going to make a run for it. [holds cellphone]
Just a simple macro. You know, these actually don't sound that funny one after another. But he does deserve it, though.
What's that? Oh, yeah, back then I did. Just now. So, don't, because I've got my eye on you.
I have one, too. Jim. Jim, Is Jim. My name is Jim.
There are thirteen people working in this office, so thirteen times a year Michael gets a cake and balloons, and some sort of joke gift and makes a toast. There are two types of toasts. One is a joke about how old you are.
I guess... all things considered, I was lucky Dwight was there.  And Roy was lucky that Dwight only used pepper spray.  And not the nunchucks or the throwing stars.
Pam.  [to camera] Sorry. [to Pam] Um, are you free for dinner tonight?
Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I think ...it seemed like you were a little nervous.
Like, a few years down the road, Cece says, 'Mom, there's a ghost in my closet.' Now, you say one of two things - one, 'You're just having a bad dream,' or two, 'Let's go see what it was.'
[sighs] Hey David, how would you like a guy who���s not here as much, gets paid the same amount of salary, and has bigger fish to fry in Philadelphia?
When you work hard, you play hard around here.  Even if you don't work hard. Oh, here's something. Uh, why didn't you ever call Pam back?
[whispering] I don't even know who you are anymore.
Two! You have a better chance, if you think Bob Vance.
And when the Indian Ocean calms, one speck of white remains in waters cold and Kelly green.'
Oh, thank God. I have such a headache from that glare.
Guys, she is a beautiful movie star, so maybe we should just go to work.
Uhh, she's still pricing the whatevers. The shredders.
And then you go to school for three years.
Nice. [Dwight runs forklift into wall of warehouse] Whoa whoa whoa whoa! Oh!
Well it���s not that easy. It���s kind of sometimes difficult.
It���s pretty great, right? I mean, we���re coming along��� [to coworker] Hey, Wade, we gotta just push up Dennis���s timeline
I think I did a pretty good job.
God bless you, Recyclops. And your cold robot heart. [Dwight throws an aluminum can towards the recycling bin and misses]
Okay, you know what, Dwight. What if you got a really serious disease like Ebola.
Travel.  I've been looking forward to it.  It's gonna be... really nice.  Gonna find myself.
Wasn't it...  It's kinda like a...  Like that.
When are we going to get to see some of those famous Beesly dance moves?
Oh, that's my mistake, sorry about that. The last paper company you worked for burned to the ground? And all because they wouldn't hire a manager who lived and breathed paper? That's a travesty.
So I guess I'll just... work on my short game.
Let me guess, you think you should get it.
Are you kidding me? I can literally scalp tickets to this.
I don't know because I everything I own is there.
And then tomorrow, I can tell you... what a great boss, you turned out to be. The best boss I ever had. [Jim is holding back tears too]
You are really good at modesty. She���s a genius.  She painted this incredible mural in the kids��� room. There���s a hippo leading a parade of 500 children���
I got 500 feet of red wire at a flea market up by Dunmore High School. 20 bucks for the whole spool. Crazy, what a deal. [behind Jim, Dwight climbs telephone pole] Oh he'll be fine. I made it up there.
I can't reconnect with you right now. Hold on one second. [he hurls a snowball at Dwight with a lacrosse stick, misses, and shatters a window, everyone gasps] Excuse me. [clears throat]
Great, It's under here as Security Guard home. Did you not get his name? Or...
Well, I'm not actually making a formal complaint. I just really think we should talk about it.
Yeah! I know it sounds stupid, but nationals has always kinda been a dream of mine.
OK, alright, that's...look. All we were trying to do is we thought we could come up with a more efficient way to do things.
Yeah. I've spoken to them on the phone.
Yeah, I actually have to agree with Dwight on that one.
There���s a big investment lunch today, so I decided to skip the costume.
Great. Guys, can I just have a moment alone with Michael?
I think they run through these panels and then down under the map. I wouldn't know for sure cause I don't have a trained ear. That's why I have to use one of these. [pulls out stethoscope]
Oh, no cause... you're gonna let me know when we're close, right?
Wow! I'm just gonna rewind and back off a bit, so... [imitates a tape rewinding and chuckles, Michael comes over by Jim laughing]
I really think we should join forces on this one.
Oh... man. I thinke when I started to see you go in I think I just froze.
Oh, I didn���t know anybody called it- She likes it a lot- she, uh, loves Elmo.
[Pam storms out of the break room] Hey...
Charles asked me to do this rundown of all my clients.
Would you like to pull a prank on Andy?
Basically after Phyllis blackmailed Angela, Michael asked them to both step down from the party planning committee cause there was too much drama.
Not that Ryan Howard. Um, the Phillies' first baseman.
Well, I kinda feel like what we have going for us is our customer service, and no matter how we change this up, I don't know that a website's going to be able to replace that.
I think you might want to kneel for this. And yet, the manager for Dunder Mifflin kneels for no one. [Dwight awkwardly squats] That���s it. You look really, really good.
You know what? I bet a lot of them are wedding crashers.
Dwight, is now a good time to go over what you expect of us?
Okay, okay, okay. Why don't we just put this to a vote, and then we'll be done with it.
Go on and fool me. Love me, love me, say that you love me
Oh, I don't know. You know, they've taken a good deal of clients, so--
Wait! Why don't we come up with a plan we're all happy about? [Michael leaves]
[walks into his office and sees the mallard back on his desk] Dwight, you brought the mallard back.
Ok, um, this is��� [leaves DVD with her]���I���ll be right back.
Exactly that. I think that you absolutely deserve the manager position more than I do.
Mmm... nope, we mostly just talked about cereal.
Wow! It's my favorite part of Christmas. The authority.
You're not leaving tomorrow. You're leaving today right?
And listen if anything else happens, just...roll with it.
Thank you. You know what, screw this! [pulls Pam into a big smooch]
[on the phone]and I���m back. How are you sir?....I think we can squeeze a couple more golf games in, right?
Oh, good, phew,  thank god you said that.
Okay. Thanks. [hangs up phone] Animal control will be here at six.
You know what?  Let's go.  We got to go to the hospital.
I'm just hiding out until all this stuff blows over.  With Creed. Playing chess. At work.  He's winning.  I feel like I'm describing a dream I had.
Well, how could you, if it just erased your memory?
[Holds up Hooters t-shirt] Just you know politics, literature.
Yes, and your mom got a very well deserved day off. So here's the thing though. I left Michael at the gas station on Benet.
Oh my God!  Wait, this goes back two years.
No, I mean, great detective work.  'Cause this must be the first case you've ever cracked, right?
Oh, can't go today, 'cause I'm donating blood.
You will never want to leave your room.
And, as much as I miss Pam and the kids, it's, uh, kinda nice to live the bachelor life again. You know, let your hair down.
Not enough? I don���t know how else to explain it to her, so, you know what? I know it���s against the rules but I���m gonna need a favor from you guys.
Mr. Decker, I'm sorry about that. What were you... Can you hold on one second? Yeah, just one second. Thanks. [Power off, silence] Hello? That's it. Perfect. So what I was saying... [Dialing tone] Hello? Thanks, Dwight.
Okay, what can I do to make you believe me?
By 2:00, Dwight will chose himself to be assistant to his own assistant, me.
Oh it's tough being here for a lot of reasons.
Yeah. You know what? I���ll meet you down there. Just gotta make a quick call.
If we can get him to drive to Connecticut... and put peroxide in his hair...
Charles is having Kevin cover the phones for a while. How do I say this diplomatically? [pause] I think Kevin is doing exactly as well as anyone might have expected someone like him to perform in a position like that.
If she can just hang on for a little while longer, I���this will be so huge for our family.
Yes, we are still dating. And guess what? I took it slow.
Come on, it's a shamrock keychain. Good luck.
[Michael, Dwight, Andy and now Pam are in the circle and training their 'weapons' on each other, Jim walks in]  Really?
Not much, it's just for tracking Dwight so---
With our firm, you'll be building equity for long after they've retired your number.
[reading text] Robert, great offer. Wish I could hit the links with you in Florida but a father of a newborn really should be helping out his wife any chance he gets.
Yeah, I am.  Wait, how do you know that?  I didn't tell you that.
And his brother, Walt Jr., locked himself in the wine cellar.
Is a mop the most efficient tool to use on a carpet?
Well, I'm going to the outlet mall on Saturday, so if you wanna save big on brand names and Roy has to work, which he will, because I'm also competitive, you should feel free to come along.
Sorry, just to be clear, you're saying do NOT shake the baby.
[Michael is wearing a wig that is very close to Jim's actual hair, and he is wearing fake earrings, and speaking in a punk-ish deep voice] I totally don't know where Michael is, dude, hey you wanna listen to some records?
Well, take your worst fear and multiply it by infinity.
Hey everybody! Just want to welcome you all to the premiere of the real Dunder Mifflin commercial, the Michael Scott director's cut. Hope you like it.
Or a high school girl. Let's go [mouths 'wow' to the camera].
And in this room here, if you look closely, you will find out a few clues about who lives here.  Um, he likes biking, obviously, and uh, what else?  Uh, he likes tour guides, I guess.  And if you're very perceptive, you'll notice that he didn't do a great job of cleaning his room [kicks water bottle under bed].  Ok, and uh, that's the tou-
Alright, here we go!  You're doing great!  She'll be here soon.
When Michael told us that Jan was pregnant, he led us all to believe that he was the father... by telling us he was the father.  But then we got this e-mail from Jan.  [waves paper and reads from it] 'Hi, everyone!  Jan here, writing to share some wonderful news and to quash a rumor.  First, the great news - I am expecting.  The beautiful baby inside me will be ready to meet the world this fall just a few months before the launch of the new Serenity by Jan line (shameless plug, I know, don't hate me, LOL).  Anyway, I also wanted to clarify that the father is not anyone that you or I have ever met.  Remember, no matter how excited someone is about my baby, it does not make them the father.  Best, Jan.  P.S. Hope to ship you something soon.'
Good one? [Toby puts on the lens cover and scurries away awkwardly] That's a cool camera.
Listen, you're the one who decided to leave. Come on, he's the new boss, you know we have to do this.
Yeah.  [Jim leans in for a kiss but Pam turns away]  She's fine.
Well, you know how much I appreciate the opportunity to hang out with your mom more. So let me just put this in my calendar.
You, you are taking about Dwight Schrute. The biggest Wonka fan I know. I mean, you've been talking about that movie for years.
Yeah, no one can snap with their little finger.
Why not, Dwight?  This is a movie.  I mean, this is for all of America to enjoy.
Yeah. No, I know. This whole telecommuting thing -- not ideal. But don���t worry. I���ll figure it out.
We were... I think she was just trying to-
Okay. Have you ever seen the movie Sixth Sense? Maybe you are already dead.
I'm pretty excited about today. I baby-sit Toby's daughter Sasha sometimes. So, she's the coolest kid. She has seen me play with dolls, though, so I don't know how cool she thinks I am.
David Wallace has asked me to come down here and see if you would be interested in Dunder Mifflin buying you out.
And I was just going to go through the system cause I didn't think you'd be there. Why, why are you still there?
Yes, I just have to take this call anyway so...
Sure I am. I am... one of the Men in Black guys. [to Pam, under his breath] Can I have your sunglasses?
[laughs] Oh man.  Oh, you know what, speaking of which, I was just trying to get a handle on, you know, numbers for food and stuff.  So do you think that Roy's gonna come, or...
So let's just say that Dwight has come at you with the throat punch.  Now how would you, Dwight, defend against it?
Okay, what was this look? [Oscar does the look.]
Okay, okay, we gotta go. All right, we're going home, we're going home. We're going home, we're going home. I know, I know, bud.
Have you asked her what she wants to do?
I think you should do it. That's great!
What are we working with, peppermint or wintergreen?
[picks a card] It's the four of hearts.
Wow, that's exciting! But until you firm up the idea, you might want to keep it between us.
[Pam is asleep, resting her head on Jim's shoulder] Um... Hey.
You should probably just meander back there; take a look.  See if he's, see if he's back.
[Pam kisses Jim on the cheek] Eleven months.
I have a surprise for you.  All right, ready?  Close your eyes and now [spins her around once] open your eyes.  Tadah!
Can I talk to you in my office for a second?
Yes. I have started to see Karen. It's very new, and... not really ready to talk about it openly yet, just because, I think, once the word gets out there, it might affect the way people behave around us or... I dunno. Just, not yet.
That's it. I want to talk to this guy. Put me in his ear.
Yeah I think we can be a big help to your company.  [someone dims the lights, signifying that it's game time]  Ok, see you next week.  Bye.  [to Karen] Again?
You know it's a tough thing, seeing a grown man take six shots to get out of a sand trap but, I had to give Phil credit for not quitting. Which is what I told him. I also told him I don't quit either, and I'd call him every single day until he gave me his business. Which he then did, after ...fifteen minutes of me blocking his car. So I am now his paper supplier! And I shot a 102 today, so I'm feeling pretty good.
Okay. Okay. [Dwight throws another snowball and laughs maniacally]
Will do. [hangs up]  I'll stop calling.  [walks into lobby]
No. [Michael gets up and walks into his office]
But, the fact remains we gotta move these boxes.
Well, you do know that Jo was right to take the job away from you, right? There's no debating that. But, I will say... in your one week, every single one of the orders went out on time. And I think that is shagadelic, baby. [Dwight sees Creed claiming the desk in the manager's office]
And I'm actually pleased to be able to offer you printer cartridges and toner now.
I'm gonna make a bigger leap here. He is into you.
That is a great offer. Thank you. I really think I should be concentrating on sales.
I can't believe we're here, I can't believe this is happening.
Honestly I have no idea. I just figured we���d save her from Ryan right?
Marijuana is a memory loss drug, so maybe you just don't remember.
Mad?  How could I be mad?  We're having a little girl.
I was talking about my wife and how she believes in ghosts. And then we had a little debate and Meredith said she believes in them too.
Were going to head outside, give it a whirl. I just want to see how it works.
[shaking hands with Abby] Ow, ow, ow, ow, you broke my hand.
Nice. You know, I cleaned our daughter for like, an hour at four a.m. this morning, so...
Yeah. Okay, so for the 1.5% increase, pro-- everyone gets a little bit.
That's why we're all going out. So we can have an end-of-the-week-drink.
[waiting outside the bathroom for Pam, he is holding a hand-picked bouquet of flowers and pacing] These are for you.
Oh, actually... uh, nope. That is my wife. Again, he���ll be calling in any second.
You know what? If we all stayed a couple of hours late tonight without Michael distracting us, we wouldn't have to come in at all tomorrow.
Oh, I understand. And I also have lots of questions, like, what does a demerit mean?
By the way, man, this place is... beautiful.
Uh, no, actually. That was in Robert���s notebook.
You can't say, or you can't pronounce it?
Oh, hey Stanley. Uh, I was just doing an impression.
Oops, that���s my phone. Am I allowed to answer it or are you gonna freak out?
Oh we were just... talking about, bureaucratic stuff...
Actually, I have the certification number right here.
If I didn���t do certain things without telling Pam, she���d be married to Roy. [chuckles]
Michael, can I... OK, I'm just going to skip right past the what and go with why.
Is it Elliot? Hey ch... chief, this is Jim Halpert from um... where you work. You're the guy who sits behind the desk... you're, you're the, the Afri... African-American guy, I mean you're. Ah... Who, Who've I got here?
I'm going to take a trip. I'm going to get out of town for a while... and go someplace... not here.
Well, maybe you should get back to work.
You're not going to do anything to his neck or his groin.
You're looking at the master of leaving parties early. They key is, you have to make a strong impression, so you want to have a picture taken, you want to say some peculiar non sequitur that people remember, you want to note something unique, a talking point, for later. I don't mean to brag, but New Year's Eve, I was home by nine.
Okay, bye. [Jim turns back to Julius] So sorry about that.
Hey, has everyone heard a crazy rumor about themselves today?
Okay, you're gonna still have to play that bean. You know that.
Okay. You had some fun, and uh, I think I paid for it. So let me get my last shot in there. Is there anything you can do for me?
Hey guys, sorry to interrupt, I uh, just found this on my desk. [shows picture of Cici with devil doodles] Need to talk to somebody about it. Can you believe that?
What do you mean? Of course it will. You're amazing.
Okay, crazy.  I think I have some better things to do with my day than worry about you, like sell printers.
Whoa, no, no. That's overdoing it, I think.
It's just that Pam gets me through the day, you know? I really rely on her. I'm pretty emotionally needy.
I've spent so much of my life telling myself 'Please, don't end up like Stanley,' and now I'm wondering if I even have what it takes.
Not great. You heckled Santa for an hour and a half.
Hey, um, I think I am gonna take that job. And Scranton... it's not that bad. So, if they offer you a job there, I think you should take it.
Okay, you know what? Why don't you take my hand, and leave them, and let's get out of here.
Yeah, I mean she was with Roy, and, uh, I just couldn't take it.  I mean, I lost it Dwight.  I couldn't sleep, I couldn't concentrate on anything.  Even weird stuff, like food had no taste.  So my solution was to move away.  It was awful.  It was something that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy, and that includes you.
Michael is on a mission to prove that he's creative.  Which I think is odd, because Michael actually might be the most creative person I've ever known.  Every day, Michael says and thinks things that no one has ever said or thought before.
Oh! That was really. [Dwight hits purse against table] This is necessary to do to really give it a good workout. This is the ooooh... This is the prettiest one of all.
Actually, I think I am. And I have a little bit of experience in office romance.
You know, it's weird.  It's practically a shot for shot remake.
[closes folder] You know what? Uh, I really don't think I should be doing this stuff anymore, you know?
Mmm... it's like Michael said. It was some- something else.
[using fake Southern accent, on the phone with Todd Packer, Dwight is also with Jim] Absolutely, now when you get down there, Jo's a little bit, uh, forgetful. So she may have locked the gate, but what you're gonna do is go ahead, hop it, and just head back to the pool. [Michael walks in on Jim and Dwight]
Are you kidding me?  We've been driving around with this stuff in the trunk the whole time?
You got to stop with the antacids. It's not the antidote.
Here's the thing.  What I wish for you is that you land a job at a company that A, exists, and B, has a salary.  Because they're set up to do that kind of thing.
Well, that is... because you didn't realize that... I was left-handed.
Oh, my God, that's Kevin! Great song, Kev. Oh,  my God, he's the drummer and the singer.
New York City is 45 minutes down the road from here. And you wanna  move to Scranton? I dunno. If I were you I'd move to New York?
Last week, I may have gone too far. I'll explain it quickly. Basically, I found out where he gets his clothes dry-cleaned. Custom ordered the same suit, made with tear-away Velcro. And... you can fill in the rest.
Are you kidding? We're in Philly. We're having dinner together. And this is just consolation champagne. It's from the part of France that immediately gave up to the Nazis. Here.
So how does it work? It���s like, you know, the action of talking to a third party breaks up the log jam, or���
Oh, my God, thank you. [hugging both] Thank you.
Mmhmm, yeah, last time I was there I had a lot of fun.
I'm not gonna let you stop me from thinking.
Ok, you know what, uh, how much is that?
I was thinking more like Europe. Or something like that. But, good second choice.
Mmhmm. No, but what I'm saying is, like, do you ever wonder what it was?
Come on, Michael says we should go now.
[Gently taps Pam on the forehead] Tied up.
Yeah. Definitely. Go Phillies, right. You don���t watch baseball. I keep forgetting that.
Hey, Andy. You know I've been thinkin about what you said-
Yeah. [Shot shows Kevin and Erin greasing floor of warehouse]
Do I think I'll be invited to the wedding? [scratches head]
What? ... No. It burned me. I... bizarre.
I bet I should. [takes cell phone photo] That's beautiful, I'm going to email that to you.
Pfft. So have I. Hey, question. If you had to spend a night in the Met or the Aquarium, which would it be?
I need a decent bonus, because I'm actually in the process of buying my parents' house so that they can retire. And if history tells us anything, it's that you can't go wrong buying a house you can't afford. Pam doesn't know about the house, so it's... a fun surprise. [taps Bluetooth earpiece] Pam, sorry about that. I lost you for a second. So, as it turns out, I may not have done so hot on my customer reviews this year.
[holds mug next to Andy's head] Make the face. [Andy smiles] Yeah, I don't see it.
But you said that you went out with her this weekend.
Yeah. On the booze cruise I told Michael about some feelings I used to have for Pam. I had just broken up with Katy and had a couple drinks. And I confided in the world's worst confidant.
I know Dwight misses Kevin. I saw him make his portrait out of a Wooly Willy. Tomorrow���s his wedding day. You can���t be anything but happy on your wedding day.
That is crazy. We would never care if Andy or Kevin went to your party.
No, I didn't. [Michael laughs] You know why?
Do you know if it's true? Do you have any idea? Because you might be ruining his life.
I'm sorry, did we or did we not pay for a show?
Take care of my wife. I will be back.
You know I love a good guessing game, but why don't I just tell you what I'm here for?  Turns out you guys have made a pretty big dent in the Dunder Mifflin sales.
So as it turns out, tonight is my nephews T-ball game and I kinda missed the first three, so...
When Michael told us that Jan was pregnant, he led us to believe that he was the father. By telling us that he was the father.
Do you want to go play on the table upstairs?
Toby and Kevin, they're trying to get Angela kicked off.
[talking on cellphone] Hey! Where you at, Filippelli?
[Pam and Jim watch video of their kiss on the tv] Oh, ah... No that's not... I mean that wasn't, ah...
What, what are you going to do? Bring it, Beesley. Bring it. Oh yeah, good move. Not such an ultimate fighter now.
Alright guys, it's a work day and you guys work here, so let's go do some work.
I did get called in to jury duty. And they released me around noon, so, didn't think it was worth it to come back to work for a half day. And then the next morning Pam was a little overwhelmed with the kids so I took an extra day to help out. And then three other days happened.
Well, I think you handled it pretty well.
Which will clearly affect the day-to-day well-being of our employees.
Uh, I actually thought we were keeping it pretty low-key.
[to Michael] It's actually Blue Cross from Pennsylvania.
I know Pam pretty well. I know the things that she likes, and, just as important, I know the things that she hates. So, one of the things that she likes is pranks. And, the things that she hates...
I have no idea where we���re gonna come up with this money, and we have to work insanely hard over the next few weeks.
I'm gonna write you up for not working.
You pet the animals and they pet you back.
Well, why did you do that? You work here, don't you want good insurance?
That actually took a while. I had to put, uh, more and more nickels into his handset, till he got used to the weight, and then I just... took 'em all out.
You know what? They all just sort of blend together after a while.
You gotta be kidding me. Who isn't jumping?
Two friends who are not sleeping together, can they remain friends? Yes, yeah.
Wow! Ok. No one else should even try! Gold medals! Give him medals. Wow.
Ooh, nog it. Let me get some nog. [Everyone talking Phyllis pours Jim some eggnog, as Daryl walks in] Thanks, Phyllis. Where's Andy?
Are you serious? [starts typing on the computer and Andy begins to lean in toward the computer]
[whispering] Okay, I'm gonna go in there and change the computer. Are you sure you can change his watch?
No, not at all. In fact, I'm not even taking it seriously. I think at the end of the day, I'm just gonna pick a name out of the hat.
[whispering, going into the bathroom with Cece] Okay. Okay. There's my girl. All right. Hold on one second. There we go. What's that face for? Oh, my-oh, my God. Cece, no. No, no, no, not on the dress! Cece, stop!
[inspecting the hole in the wall] Oh my God, that's half-inch drywall.
Hey guys, why don't we, uh, just cool off a bit?
Oh my God, are you alright?  Erin, will you call 911 please?
Hey, so this isn���t matching up with this���and I���m not sure which one���s right. Can you just hunt down the original for me?
Well it���s sales. So you have to be able to live in the world of rejection.
[laughs] You're a good kid. You know what? It gets bigger once you're in there. Enjoy it. [shuts the door and walks to his office]
Then why would you want to set me up with your daughter?
Thank you, sir. [Tips his glass to Daryl]
Well, I actually agree with her, I think you should talk to him.  And you also might want to explain to Andy that no one wants to help him decide whether or not he has a rash.
OK. And they're all dangerously close to not getting pie. And there's only one guy who can save them. It's not me.
Hey, just wanted to check in. See how you are doing.
Yeah, I mean it's inevitable. I definitely overhear some wedding preparation, but I'm fine with it. She hears me arranging my social life. And we both have to hear Dwight order deer urine over the Internet, so it evens out.
There was one thing we were curious about, uh, your flexibility on things like Easter or Memorial Day, because we might want to change our days around a little bit.
OK, I'm gonna assume that was it. Here's the thing: I think you're right. I think it was Kelly. I think she's mad at us for not coming to her party.
Hey, Creed, we covered it. Lump of coal!
Well there is some bad news.  [accent] There has been another murder.
Kismet? Yeah, right. Pam and I came up with excuses for every other weekend. You remember my two lap band surgeries, right? Neither do I? ���Guten Prank��� number one.
I think it has something to do with Survivor, but I'm not sure.
Anyway, now we are going bargain hunting in the haunted graveyard of their love.
Okay well, Andy, listen. It's okay if you don't feel totally settled. This is all very fresh.
Hey, what was that movie where their boss was within earshot and they could've just gone and talked to her.
You know, there's a glare from over here... oh wow, that's magnificent.
Uh, you know what though? I feel like I already sicked him on Pam... we'll give her a break. Let's think of someone else.
Yeah, I mean, the Count has a very distinct voice.
And I don't support her choice to hit you.
Okay, I can't find my keys!  I cannot find my keys!  Found 'em.  They're here.
I'll make it worth your while, I promise.
The best news is, we're going to have a baby today.
I thought it was great, sweetie. I would just fix that one --
No need.  I saw him do it.  I can try it.
Pam, I���m not explaining this to you-- Pam, I���m not going over this again.
I mean I can see how it would seem a bit like we uh... How it looks like um... I mean now a days you can edit anything, right? I mean you can edit anything to look like um... anything.
[after entering daycare] Ok, this is officially the cutest thing I've ever seen. Cubbies. I totally forgot about cubbies.
Like hypothetically��� if I said there was another job. That you and I could both have.
They weren���t really talking that much about money. They just said, We���re good with investing and then I...and I...
Have you ever seen 'em do that? [walk outside and the parking lot is covered with snowmen]
Oh, there's no game.  We're just trying to get these chips for Karen.
Oh, great. So we���ll see somebody else���s kid with Cece in the background? I mean, it���s really not that hard to film a video.
[Jim goes outside, makes a snowball, and brings it back inside] Hey, Dwight. [Jim throws the snowball at Dwight and everyone laughs]
OK. [Dwight runs in place] What are you doing? Are you really revving up? you know that doesn't work.
OH, that's great. I'm really happy for [starts to walk away]
[holding up a sign that reads, 'Dwight picked the wrong day to put a wooden mallard in my office']
You know what? Maybe we should cancel that bottle of wine tonight.
We are the Search Committee, hand-picked by our CEO, and tasked to find this branch's new manager. Not everyone we meet will be good, but someone's bound to be, right? [Andy, Kelly, and Darryl are each dressed up in suits for their interviews, Andy is also wearing an 'Andy for Manager?' pin on his jacket] And, to be honest, I think a lot of the decent candidates are right here in-house, so, I'm not too worried. But I'm really excited to spend a lot of time with Toby and Gabe. [quietly] Did you know that Gabe's last name was Lewis? I had no idea.
Dwight. Dwight. [Dwight's car comes screeching into view]
Imagine going back and watching a tape of your life. You could see yourself change and make mistakes���and grow up. You could watch yourself fall in love, watch yourself become a husband, become a father. You guys gave that to me. And that���s���an amazing gift.
I am a diapering master.  I have done little else in the past two months.  There is nothing I cannot diaper.  Go ahead.  Try to think of something.  I dare you.
That's... great. You know, to tell the truth, I used to have a big thing for Pam, so...
Um, you know what, I actually didn���t handle that move, uh, very gracefully. From not communicating to being a little selfish.
Yeah. [Pam puts her hand out for an earbud] Definitely.
What? No, no, no! Come on! This is real!
Thanks Dennis, I appreciate it. [To Pam] Hey! How are you?
You're not getting an interview, Dwight. The whole point of this Search Committee process is to prevent hiring someone like you ever again.
Oh, now I get what Pete was talking about at the sales meeting yesterday.
[answers phone] Hey! Yeah. No, I got it. Just leaving now.
[sings] Love me, love me, say that you love me, fool me, fool me,
Oh wow.  So that���s two miles if you incorporate the walk back.
Actually if I had fewer outside classes, I probably wouldn't be stuck here at a paper company.
Nope. I mean, I could have brought a change of clothes, or-
No, no, no. Not ever, 'cause that's not gonna happen.
He's not the Steve Nash. He's big though. He's kind of like...Scranton's Steve Nash.
And you know what? I even made fun of you when you dressed up as Willy Wonka to pitch this idea and for that I apologize.
Between the - us and you guys. It's unnecessary, right?
[Gets up and looks out Nellie���s office window] He���s running!
And if you want Michael as Santa, raise your hand. [Michael, then Dwight raises hand]  Can I get you some punch?
[confused] What? [Darryl points at his thermos Jim has been using] Oh, man! I'm sorry about that.
And then, I'm pretty sure he's gonna fire you for it.
So smug. Like he thought it was funny, like this.
Alright, let's conference room it up! [everyone is now in the conference room]  Here's the deal guys.  There is no new information as of yet, so I suggest we all just keep working.
Hey. It���s nothing. Alright? I���ll text you when we get there. Let you know what���s going on.
That whole lifestyle, his whole vibe, you find that appealing?
Well, maybe you shouldn't try to kiss people at work.
Okay, hold on. Are you sure Mose isn���t going to show up?
Sorry. I���no, no, no, what I meant���what I meant actually was���
I'm sorry, are you really trying to get us to invest in Jan's company?
Well, as long as you don't want to alarm people...
Well I thought that, I figured you should hear it from me rather than, I mean you know Michael.
Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Um��� I don���t know how to tell you this, but��� we have a little bit of a problem.
Am I the only one that���s nervous? How are you doing with this? Should we have bailed?
Hey, Andy, I have some calls to make.
What is that? [looks at sign that says 'IT IS YOUR BIRTHDAY.'] It is your birthday period.
Ok, I have a question. Why is the truck so far away?
[not thinking clearly because of Pam's note] What's that? Oh, uh, great.  You know?  I just um, I really appreciate the buildings, and uh, the people, and um, there's just a [sic] energy... New York has, uh...  Not to mention, they have places that are open past eight.  [David laughs] So that's a... bonus.
Oh, man.  You know what?  This might take a while.  You really don't have to stay, if you don't want.
Pam comes back from New York next week and everyone here has just been so excited for me. And involved. And intrusive. And weird.
Hey, Phyllis. Are you just getting back from lunch now?
Cece���s really into princesses now. So we decided to turn them into a positive female role models.
Okay. Just want to let you know I take complaints very seriously. So... When did this happen?
[on phone] Yes, I'm calling from Dunder Mifflin. We have a very rabid porcupine in our office, someone should come pick it up.
Good!  Fine!  I've got one Andy Bernard that will direct this puppy for half your fee... [dialing phone]
I just need some time. Just give me some time to make a decision.
[on phone] Please don't pick up, please don't pick up, please don't pick up.
OK, so Corporate is still in their meeting.
Um... okay. Ah, you know what? Maybe I'll... I'll finish explaining the rules. Let's... let me explain it first, and then...
Whoa, pull it back. Uhm, why did you hire Todd Packer?
Good night, Dwight. [Jim leaves, Dwight continues crying]
They're legumes Dwight, and you're just gonna make fun of me, so why would I... You know what, this ends now. [crumples up beans, stomps on them, and throws them in a box]
We lost Bridgeport Capital. I have no idea what happened. It���s like everything I did, he just wouldn���t go for it.
Stupid.  Everyone knows to ask for a hundred more wishes. [Pam laughs] Dumb.
That's not gonna make your pizza eating experience any better. Trust me.
This guy was good. Although, he did keep saying that he needed two weeks off right at the beginning for a trip to the finger lakes. Seriously. Every five minutes, he was like, 'just making sure the finger lakes thing is clear.'
Or it could be a half hour, if you need it to be...  Can we get a late checkout?  I don't...  I don't think she heard me.
Oh my God. Dwight got a hooker! Oh my God, I gotta call... well, I gotta call somebody, I don't even know who to call. Dwight got a hooker!
See, I knew we lost somebody on the tour.  It's-
Look, you guys are smart, so I'm just leveling with you. I'm just trying to treat you like adults.
But you didn't believe any of this was true five minutes ago.
I���m gonna need you to look at your hierarchy mobile. You���ve got a regional manager.
Ohh, man, I would love to! I can't tonight, but can I come over some other time? [Abby nods]
New leads, a new territory to look into, maybe an in with a big company that we could get our foot in the door���
Oh no, I didn't want to see you.  Not that I'm not happy seeing you, right now, I'm just saying ultimately I was here for the copier.  Equal, I'd say it was equal.  So, good to see you...
I mean, I can handle any client issues from Philly.
You know what, just think about it, you'll be fine.
Um, she's easy to talk to I guess and she's got a really good sense of humor.
I'm so sorry, I think I forgot that thing...
[as Pam has another contraction]  Oh!  Oh, alright.  That's a good one.
You should stop this, [pulls away mayo and olives bowl] and you should call Dwight right now.
[reading screenplay] Bullets are flying everywhere.  Ooo, wait, last page, big finish.  Here we go. Agent Michael Scarn kicks open the plane door with a karate chop.
Because of the sign, that says no pounding no begging.
All right. ��Thank you so much. Wow. Wow! And good night! [applause continues]
I think you're good.  Doing a good job.
We, uh, we haven't talked about. But I think that she's���I think she understands... what this is.
Ok, I'll buy you a bag of chips.
Oh that sounds fun. I'm mountain biking on Sunday. On Montage Mountain.
Because I'm gonna miss Toby. Yep, he's a heck of a guy, and I think we should send him off right. It doesn't matter. Here ya go. [hands her an envelope with money in it]
[office phone rings at Jim's desk] This is Dwight.
I'm in an office relationship. It's special. Um... she's nice. She's shy. She's actually here. You want to meet her? Hold on one second. Oh, my God! Put on a shirt! Put on a... . I told you that you'd be on camera. I'm sorry, she's European. No, I told you that you'd be on camera. Stop it.
So you're taking over. You just gotta get her out of there as soon as you can.
I missed you. [they embrace and kiss as Andy watches on sadly]
[Jim moves his head closer and Pam taps him gently in the face] Oh, ok.
Party looks fun doesn���t it?  Everybody seems to be in there having a great time.  So maybe now would be a great time for me to pop back on the computer.
I may have told some people that.  I'm nervous.  I'm about to get married.
Well, I do the best with what I've got. Let's go.
I wanted to talk to you about your divorce.
That is... quite the rap sheet, Prison Mike.
[whistling, places cup of coffee onto Dwight's desk] Ahh, Thank you hands. Nothing else in the universe can do what you do.
Well, I can't be the only one who didn't -- [sees mugs on Angela's and Meredith's desks]
Thank you for all of this. This is so helpful. You know what? One last question. Um, who is that fine older gentleman in the corner? [points to Creed]
Ok, he has to be stopped. Please, please, please, please, just ask Michael.
Three, two, one! [pulls sheet to reveal Christmas tree]
I love Star Wars as much as the next guy���
[blows a raspberry, Erin looks shocked, Kevin chuckles]
OK, I want a copy on my desk by the end of the day or you will receive a full disadulation.
I'm doing OK. Getting excited for the weekend though. What are you up to?
That is a lie, that is a lie.
Are you inviting me to the Finer Things Club?
Alright. [Jim's phone rings] Oh, sorry. I'm so sorry. It's my wife, can I take this?
Yeah... .you want me to come in your office?  Oh.
Oh, man, I���d have to sell beets. Probably submit them for competitions.
[to camera, holds up a bean] Each Boston Baked Bean represents half a percent raise. We each got 24 beans, so the idea is, you place the bean on the picture [walking around the table] of who you think deserv-- who's that? [picture that Michael drew of toby, looks like a monster]
I mean, a performance-based raise sounded like a good idea, right?
Yes, conference room in five minutes... No. No. We're gonna solve it right here. We're actually gonna talk about it out here. So, who has problems with the birthday thing? [everyone raises hands] One, two, three, everybody. OK, so then we just shouldn't do it.
Some events are so news worthy, so historic, that you have to stop everything to watch. Balloon Boy, Michael Jackson's funeral. Things that if you didn't see them live, you wouldn't really care that you didn't see them at all.
So apparently Pam went out last night, and accidentally called my work phone at 3:00 in the morning.
No, it's not 'ugh.' It is... office camaraderie.
So, as it turns out, Dwight is right. How bizarre.
Oh man, I was supposed to tell Dwight something......C'mon, Jim. [shakes head] I got nothin'.
I just didn't, you know, want a deal.
But it���s Dwight who���s bring in all the weirdos.
Pete couldn't make the Mets. She's at Pratt. You played JV baseball. Will you lighten up a little bit?
Would you hold on one second? That's my other line.
Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
[Dwight imitates the 'Jim face'] Look at that.
[on phone] Oh thank you Hank. You are a lifesaver, Hank. Appreciate it. [to office co-workers] Alright, so Hank is gonna come down here and he's gonna let us all out. [lowers voice] He said it should just be under an hour, so... [everyone groans] we did it.
Either way, Dwight��� I can���t be there for you. I���m sorry.
Look, I would so take him in any other circumstance, but I'm pretty certain I'm completely wasted.
Okay, I think the game's over... People are like leaving. There was a bigger crowd last time. Do you just want to go to lunch?
I don't think I'm gonna miss being manager. You know how some people say they're not in it for the money? Well, with all due respect to this job, I think I'm definitely in it for the money. And quite honestly, the women.
But what about the assistant assistant to the regional manager?
Oh, we're supposed to call everything we don't want to do ���opportunities.���
You���re not serious, right? I mean, how is that fair? I���m in Philly. These are my days in Philly. You���ve agreed to this.
Yep. Wait, and this. [hands Dwight a hammer]
[singing the intro to The Lion King's 'The Lion Sleeps Tonight'] A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh...
It's like when he annoys me and I want to screw with him to get him back, he never sees it coming.  But now, I want to be nice to him, and actually give him something, and he's like an eel.  I just can't grab onto him.  It's infuriating.
Absolutely not. It's just that sometimes... goodbyes are a bitch.
To be honest, I don't know, but maybe I could just yell at him in front of people.
We should take a look at those surveys.
[on phone] Hey, Brenda.  This is, uh, Jim Halpert from the boat.  And I got your number from the corporate directory and, well, I was assuming that you probably gave it to them because you wanted me to ask you out, right?  Um, so gimme a call back.  You can get my number from said directory, um, or just check your e-mail 'cause I just sent you one.  Yikes.  Uh... give me a call back, I hope.  I'll talk to you later. Bye.
So I broke up with Katy and haven't been dating anybody else, so this year I don't have to worry about Valentine's Day. It's gonna be good. I invited a couple of friends over. We're gonna play some cards and I'll end up winning a lotta money. Because, they're idiots. It's gonna be great.
Do you mean, like break-in in the middle of the night and change the numbers on payroll?
Yeah, or maybe we don't even need that.
Look its one day, everything's gonna be alright. No big deal. You good?
That rhymes, so what have we on the docket today?
And when it happens, it's going to kick your ass, Beesly. So... stay sharp.
I don't have a ton of contact with the Scranton branch, but, before I left, I took a box of Dwight's stationery, so, from time to time, I send Dwight faxes. From himself. From the future. [reading fax] 'Dwight, at 8 A.M. today, someone poisons the coffee. Do not drink the coffee. More instructions will follow. Cordially, Future Dwight.'
Hey, man. It���s halpert. Did you go to the other guy yet? Great, don���t. I���m in. Yeah, yep, I���m all in. Ok, talk to you soon. Bye. [hangs up] Yeah!
No. I'm not a lawyer, but I don't think this is the place to do this.
What can I say, Dwight, I live a very dangerous life.
Hey. She had a nice time. It seems rude.
No, Dwight, I meant... Yes, in a perfect world, someone would get money.  But-
I really felt like I almost lost her, and���and nothing is worth that.
Okay, seems like everybody has an opinion. So, who else? Anybody?
I mean, if we go in there and take these raises, what are we saying? That it's okay for someone to just take someone else's job? Shouldn't work like that.
I am not surprised that Dwight's using my baby to steal my desk. I'm a little surprised that it's working.
Oh, those are drawings.  In case the writing didn't really put a picture in your head.  And there he is, in the flesh, Agent Michael Scarn.  Now we know what he looks like.
Is this you? Are you being you, or is this Creed? Are you...
Wow. That was Dwight. He seems upset about something.
Tony the tiger.  You don't hear that much any more.
[ignoring Darryl's question] So I think all we need is a resume, and we'll be good right?
Ok, Dwight! Come on. Here, I think I have an idea.
Alright, I���m gonna go warm up the car.
Cool. Okay. I'm gonna go home and lie down, draw the shades... there's just so much sun in here... bye Dwight.
Wait a second. You know you can't buy that now, right? And I can come back and get it for you later. But I'm saying right now, we can't do that.
I promise you, we don���t need a warning-
Well, you know, Wallace put me in charge, so you have no say.
Oh, you know what we should probably preserve the batteries.
Very nicely done. I think that's H-O-R for Stanley, and H-O for Phyllis.
If this job is in a well, I don't want it.
It's, okay, it's Jim.  Just say again, uh, really loudly what happened.
No, I hear what you���re saying, and we will. The thing is, we gotta lock down this key demographic first. The rest will come, I promise. Just give me a couple weeks, alright?
Not bad, but you are Italian so... try it more Italian.
I gotta tell you, this baby is amazing. She gets me out of everything. And I - and I love her. I also love her, very much.
How do you not spread out the tickets into different shipments?
Based on his nickname. Like it already. Let me guess, it's autobiographical.
I don���t know how else to tell you.
Post-it Notes. Wow, that purse holds a lot.
Wow.  Um, ok. [pops Dwight's orb with scissors]
It���s Ryan. ���I���m sorry. I lied. I���m not in the bathroom. I can���t do it. I need to see my mom. I���m going home.���
Phyllis, what was that?Phyllis are you dreaming, or--
He���s got a bank vault. That���s a start.
I'm going to be the prettiest girl in the ball.  Oh, how much?
OK, here we go... Digest of business terms, CliffsNotes on business economics, and a sales encyclopedia.
Yeah, we did. Hey, how long���how long do we think that���s gonna take?
Just cut through it, man, it's no big deal.
Is it me, or are we just a little off today?
[presses button on headset] Hello, this is Dwight.
Today.  Now, maybe.  'Cause we have a hoop downstairs and a real ball, so you don't have to mime it.
Well, if Pam says she won���t go, then���[chuckles] we���re gonna need a lot more than counseling. Hmph.
No, no, no, no, no. Uh, we���re just starting couple���s counseling. Uh, which doesn���t sound any better.
Why's it smell real? [Pam shows him a hidden car-freshener] Ah... good one.
These are the Closing Ceremonies. Step up. You're on the top one.  [Michael stands on podium] Congratulations to Michael, because he closed on his condo. So, gold medal. [everyone claps]
By the way, did we leave all the food on the bus?
Oh my God, he's making you look like such a fool.
This is hilarious, but we���re gonna stop with all--
Oh, okay. [kisses Pam] Don't worry about it.
Oh, Andy.  You know what?  We don't have a
You've been making that sign, for something that we could just announce to the whole office? Hey everybody, the party's now at 3!
It's not, it's not Eddie, it's ah, Evan or...
You could just be saying it to get the job.
No! Stop! Stop stop stop stop! You're way over! Ok, you gotta cut it! Cut it hard! (bleep!) Stop stop stop stop! Stop, stop! Dammit Dwight. Great.
I just got a text from Robert California that says ���bring your clubs to Florida���.
[on phone] Yeah, no, it seems to be going great. Andy got beat up by a fifth grade girl?
So beautiful. [Pam's starts to cry.  Jim pulls up chair to sit next to her] Hey--
I tried to keep Michael in the dark.  I should have known that he can do just as much damage in the dark.
Did you ever think that because you own the building, everyone in it, we're all kinda like your children?
Yes. He is. And you know what? We cannot let that happen.
Kevin, you know what, why don't you close your eyes? Imagine that Hilary Swank comes into this office for real and she walks over to you [in a more and more seductive voice] and says Kevin Malone, I just read your online profile and there is nothing I would rather do then make out with you right now. And now you tell me something, is she hot? [Kevin gets up to join the 'hot' team to their great joy] Does that end the debate?
All right, you know what? [picks Pam up and carries her off the court] Let's do this.
I'm just killing Germans, any way I can.
And this dude labels his food. He's the clean one. And, I'm the messy one. How much fun is this?
This... is the future, because... This is the past. I���ve been through a lot of issues in my life. I���ve seen drug addiction -- unemployment. I���ve been in a relationship that tore my heart apart, without ever being able to accept that love drove the pain. [scattered applause]
No, no - this is a representation of how we feel. And how we feel is: really sorry.
[Karen punches buttons on an ATM] Yeah, we went to the Spotted Pig for dinner. It's in the Village. Uh, Karen knew it. And then we second acted Spamalot. That's when you sneak in at intermission with all the smokers. And then we went to a bar that used to be a church. Oh and at this one bar, I swear I saw Lorne Michaels.
Truthfully anything would have been better than that prank. [laughs] Oh, text message from my brother. 'Pam cool. Welcome to the family.'
I don���t know. He wasn���t talking to me. But if I were you I wouldn���t hire his wife.
You know, I've just realized, this is Pam's and my first night away together. I use to play it over my head, and it was just a little bit different. Maybe a uh, nice hotel. Or a romantic dinner. Wine... uh but, wine that wasn't made out of beets. Didn't think Dwight would be involved at all. And uh, I always imagined less manure. I mean, some manure, just... less.
Okay. But what is he more famous for?
All right, well it already went through, so...
Well it's just that you had no hair on Friday.
Don't. Stop, Dwight! [Dwight pelts Jim with snowballs] Dwight, stop! Dwight, stop!
Ok, well let's just try this one on for size. And I apologize because it's right off the top of my head:  an ice sculpture. Of you. Completely surrounded by a variety of chocolate-covered fruits.
No, you're not reopening the case.  The case is closed.
Things are a little bit... different here in Stamford. [shrug] It's not bad.
[Dwight walks back to his desk] 19 minutes and 48 seconds.  What were we doing for 19 minutes and 48 seconds?
Why don't we play that alphabet game that you were talking about?
Yeah, I never even knew that part of the office existed. [Pam chuckles] Hey, who's that guy? [Jim points to Stanley]
Here, you know what? You can have some nickels.
Oh, well I yell. You've heard me yell.
Ha ha. No, I don't. No, I don't. Alright, well, I am sore and obviously horrible at this, so- [texting on his phone]
You know a ton of fourteen year old girls?
Yeah, that's what I had for breakfast and I think that's probably why I'm still hungry.
That was beautiful. All her idea too. Awesome. She is so great.
Uh hmm, he should be fine, but, uh, they brought him in for a CAT scan.
Oh Dwight, Dwight, [Dwight pukes on his back windshield]  Ohhhhhh!
All right. You know what? ��Maybe we���ll just... We���ll go slow.
Okay, Scott, why don't you take your head out of the clouds and come back down to planet Earth so we can make a commercial.
Wallace? What the hell, have you dated like every guy here? [Karen smiles and gives herself away] Wow. Ok. You got me.
You cut more than you had to, didn't you?
I bought it.  It's ours.  Let's go inside, I'll show you inside.  [walking inside] So if you can believe it I did it without a realtor.  Saving on closing costs is good and, uh, we can put all the money to de-shag the carpet.  Which I think will help, the color situation. [Pam walks over to the clown painting on the wall]  Yeah, I am really sorry about this.  I tried to move it but he is really nailed in there.  Worried about art theft, I guess, lot of art theives in this neighborhood.  [upstairs] This is the master bedroom but, I'm actually not allowed in here so... [shuts the door]
But if not, there's always the army. The infantry.
Okay, I'll try. [The coat rack wobbles] [Pam holds up an umbrella handle to the camera in another scene]
Michael's birthday. It's pretty fun to watch, actually. He gets very excited, and then he eats a lot of cake. And then he runs around the office. Then he has a sugar crash in the afternoon. And then he falls asleep. And that's when we get our work done.
Right! Exactly. [pats Oscar on the back and walks away] Knew I could count on you. [Oscar rolls his eyes]
Okay. Love you. We'll talk soon. [hangs up phone]
Yup, I do make great Christmas gifts. But I couldn't make that.
Why did I transfer to Stamford?  I think that's pretty obvious.  I got promoted!  And you can't beat that view... right?
[he office shushes Michael to hear the movie better] That's fine, it's great!
Well, we went on a Segway tour and we're awesome at it and Frank and Beans!
So, Andy, what improvements would you make as office manager?
Ow, What are you doing? [Jim fights back]
OK, great, listen to me. Listen to me. [Dwight makes funny gesture] No, no, I know. Will you just let me tell you one thing, please?
[getting up quickly to silence Michael] No, no. Nope.
Michael had chicken potpie for lunch. Actually, let me rephrase that, Michael had an entire chicken pot pie for lunch, and- let me be more specific. Michael ate an entire family-sized chicken potpie for lunch and then he promptly fell asleep, so we're all trying to be very quiet so as to not wake him up before 5:00 pm. Which, actually, should be in about... ten minutes.
One day Michael came in complaining about a speed bump on the highway. I wonder who he ran over then.
That's impossible, cause that's a brand new bag...[looks up to ceiling where there is a red tape X over Dwight's chair] Oh my god.
This came out really well. [picks up Dwight's I.D. from the laminating machine and hands it to Dwight] There you go.
[on the phone] Hey, did I tell you we were going to have a baby?  Oh, thank you very much.  I'm excited.  Oh, definitely.
So. Uh... I am going on a trip. But not really sure where I'm going yet. It's kind of open-ended. So I was hoping maybe you guys would have some suggestions?
Bye. ��[pause] Yep. See, you���ve still got to press ���End,��� Pam.
Wow. I thought you were good at Flash.
Right now, this is just a job. If I advance any higher in this company then this would be my career. And uh, well, if this were my career, I'd have to throw myself in front of a train.
How much time do you have left on your break?
Actually, we've been dating for a couple months.
Yeah. Do you want me to take these on my way out?
It expired in August, and my cell phone charger from two years ago.
The weird part about this whole deal this that Michael truly believes that these awards are inspiring and motivational. I mean, he puts more effort and time and commitment into the Dundies than anything else he does all year. Which is probably why this branch will be downsized.
Those are like my favorite movies. I didn't really think you could win Desert Island, but I think you just did.
So sadly, it's the best idea on the table.
You know what? I would save the receptionist. I just wanted to clear that up.
[hushed voice] Uh yeah. Trust me, I���d rather be with you guys.
[after Darryl eyes him drinking from a thermos] It's mine. Don't worry.
[walking to his car] Hey, it's me.  It is 5:03.
[Philip is crying] I know, buddy, I know. Cece, you want to come? Want to come out?
Why do you have the Big picture up again? You used that already, when you burned your foot.
Yeah, this is actually about the new sales guy. Uh, Dwight has brought in a bunch of real weirdos. And I was wondering if I could have some input���
[talking on phone] You sound tired. Everything ok?
Toby and I used to sit together until Michael moved us because he thought we talked too much.
Look, there was a big mistake obviously, so I will fix it.  Okay?  This was your idea anyway.
I am on the first hot sale streak of my life. I think it all comes from feeding Cece, because no matter how much she resists, I sell her those carrots. Let's be honest--if I can make mushed carrots seem better than a boob... I can pretty much sell anything. [laughs]
Six point five days. [winces as Kevin smacks him on the back]
Karen and I are having our own contest to see who can eat the most normal amount of tuna salad in an unspecified but very cofortable amount of time. I don't know what to tell you. Right now? Dead heat.
[In Kitchen] We're thinking of collaborating with Mike Schmidt on some of his charity work.
[pumps fist] ...Saturday, so just let me know what you're doing tomorrow, Saturday, for lunch. Ok, talk to you soon.
And I gotta say, this was a tough decision. And we had to go with none of you.
[in the phone] You know what, Pam? I was thinking maybe we should change course here. Let's give up on all this mean stuff.
No, will not, I'm not going to tell anybody. This is between you and me.
Oh, I thought you asked me what our chances were in being murdered here tonight.
Um, thank you, Ryan, uh, I don't know, I think I made the mistake one day of telling someone that I like penguins, and here we are.
God, give it up, Beesley. You know me too well.
Oh, right, some drunk guy hit on Pam last year. Said he was grabbing her for balance.
This is not an excuse to blow off work doing carnival-like activities. Sure, every participant will be getting a corndog, but that���s for fueling only. No savoring.
Stanley just drank OJ out of my mug, and didn't seem to realize that it wasn't his hot coffee. So the question has to be asked, is there no limit to what he won't notice?
Why don't we just call the I.T. Guy who set it up? What's the name of the guy in Glasses, again?
Oh, don���t look at me cause I think you���re making a terrible choice.
[Robert leaves the conference room and looks at the others in the office as he grins at the camera and leaves] He creeps me out. [Toby nods] But, I think he might be a genius.
Nothing. I just wanted to congratulate you on your condo.
Aw, thanks, Pete. That was really nice. I just want to say how happy we are that all of you are here tonight. And I want to especially thank those of you who traveled from far away to be here with us tonight... especially the Flordia cousins who, obviously, can't take a hint. [laughter] Four years ago, I was just a guy who had a crush on a girl who had a boyfriend. And I had to do the hardest thing that I've ever had to do... which was just to wait. Uh, don't get me wrong. I flirted with her. Pam, I can now admit in front of my friends and family that I do know how to make a photo copy. Didn't need your help that many times. And do you remember how long it took you to teach me how to drive a stick?
Michael, it's not about... I transferred because of Pam.
You mean Laverne's Pies Tires Fixed Also? [Pam nods] Yes we will be doing that. We'll be getting a dozen.
Uh, for that printer, yes. Unfortunately we don't have a lot of flexibility.
[sings Olympic theme song] This scented candle ...andle ...andle. Which I found in the men's bathroom ...room ...room. Represents the eternal burning of competition. Or something.
OK, but what if I told you all the money you spend here, goes to preventing a disease that's already been cured.
Yes!  How are you going to cook every meal of the day in one kitchen?
I know this was really weird, and it was really hard. But I think we're making progress. So I'm really sorry that I have to go but let's keep at this. Ok?
Oh, right. I remember that one. She read it to me. She said she's not really ready to date somebody in the office, but she really likes you as a friend.
And I got to take this bad attitude, and I got to go home, and I got to adjust it. And I hope the suspension does that.
Oh boy, please don't. Let's not let that happen.
Only if you tell me what you're writing.
Hey guys let���s just all admit it. Ok? Dwight���s better than us. He had the guts to stop sitting. And he���s never, ever going to go back on it right?
Ok. You shouldn't be telling me that stuff and also shouldn't be taking two hour lunches without telling me.
It didn���t have a buster sign around him?  Why don���t you draw him?  Why don���t we see this whole thing.
You know, truth be told, I think all you���ll really be doing is accepting calls from my clients while I���m gone.
No, we agreed, two percent for the quarter. Okay [others enter] Hey everybody!
OK, here's the deal. All right? Pam says that one of the alliances is meeting in the warehouse during Meredith's birthday.
Ah, gotcha.  Okay, so they have Albert Einstein, Ben Franklin, or Sponge Bob Squarepants.
OK. Or maybe I could finish the coffee that's in here and you could use [finds a mug] uh, oh -- Snoopy.
These are actually forks and knives from the break room.
Oh man, it's gotta be over a hundred thousand dollars.
Weeks. Always weeks. Man, the last time I talked months was like, a million weeks ago.
To think that my gift for Pam will be used for that, it's a little too much to handle.
In Philly, so, that doesn���t really work for the family. Watch this guy make a billion dollars off my idea.
Dwight has been acting manager for three months now. No. A week. Just feels like three months. Let's see, we all have to punch in to a time clock, which is very old, very strong, and has a slot about the size of a finger. [Jim puts a pencil into the time clock and pulls it out broken in half] We were all given new business cards big enough to set us apart from the competition, which is how I learned that our titles are all now Junior Employee. Our lunch breaks are staggered to prevent wasting time. Mine's at 10:30, and I find that the first hour of the day goes by a lot quicker than the second seven hours.
Well I'm trying to. Do you see what I'm doing?
No. Not too hard. Not harder than I should.
Then tragedy struck Recyclops when his fictional planet was attacked by some other fictitious thing... I can't remember.
Oh. Is this, uh, is this your niece?
[in the kitchen] Oh, here's one. Did I ever tell you about the time that my brothers videotaped the lottery announcement? And bought the winning numbers the next day? And then, played the tape for me the next week, and I-
Oh totally.  Sorry, are we talking about the microwave still?
Ok, you know what? Andy probably has the number for this guy. I'm gonna find him.
All right, here we go! Everybody get read in three, two, good luck, one-
You see that?  I'm pretty sure she's...  Hi.
We can just have one big fun party. Everybody's happy, nobody wastes their time.
I think you got this. Kay? [Erin nods] Alright. Feel better!
Oh no she just put it in front of my face.
When Michael plays the hypothetical game, I always say yes.
Sounds like someone's really trying to convince us that he's not the Scranton Strangler.
That's great. Well don't tell me who it is, cause I can ..
No, you're not. I'm looking right at you.
[to Pam] Can you believe this? [pause] He was pretty talkative at breakfast.
No, definitely. All right, dude. Awesome. Will do.
Well that's great.  [shakes Ryan's hand] You're talking about your court ordered community service?
I never considered that my week off would make everyone else's job harder. The least I could do is give them a good story.
Ok. So, we're going through all the wedding plans and, boy, it is complicated.
Nah, you definitely weren���t kidding.  And that came across loud and clear. Oh, by the way, I want to hand this in. [hands Andy slip of paper]
Forget it. I was just about to brag but forget it.
Hey. So, Wade wants to send people to the Sloan conference. We gotta compile a list of our target clients.
You know what you should do? Take a vacation.
No, Pam, you're gonna lose him to another wedding.
Hey Jo, it's Jim Halpert. I actually scheduled a meeting at 7:30 with a very important client. And it's so weird, because we never have meetings after 5pm. But I was hoping that maybe just this once, it would be okay.
You know what? Why don't you take the rest of the day, figure it out and then come back and tell me what you got.
Karen and I had a long talk last night and the night before that and uh, every night, for the last five nights.
Nope I don't, remember when you told us not to make plans 'cause we're working.
Yeah, the crazy thing about that is, um, wow you look great. Did you lose some weight?
Well, some of us wanna keep reading, so-
I���ll tell you what I could accept is assistant to the regional manager. That is a real job and one I���d be proud to take.
Yes!  I think we should look into that.  If you could just speak up louder...
So, how was the resort?  Did you ski a lot?
[presses drink button, looks at camera, makes Jim-face]
And Dwight is imitating Japanese business practices for reasons he explained to us in Japanese.
Okay. We haven't gone under. We've been sold and that can mean many different things.
Hey, Dwight. As Sempai, do you think there is ever going to be a day where humans and robots can peacefully co-exist?
Alright Pam, alright [gives her hi-five]. Nice work!
I haven���t heard of it, obviously. But I���m out because I am significantly younger than you-
Yep, I'm very passionate about Italian food.  In fact, um, I'm in love with Italian food.
Okay, here's uh, this is very simple. 'Dwight's Workspace,' nice.
It's a complete... well, actually it's exactly what you'd expect, so... How are the girls?
I don't know probably just gonna eat my ham and cheese sandwich in the break room.
Yeah, well, three dollars a mile. It's gonna end up being like 50 bucks. So... God, I can't even calculate what you're gonna have to give.
���Megan, I was too shy to tell you this when I was just a normal professional baseball player, but I love you.���
Listen, you gotta get over here, 'cause we're pitching Steve Nash and Danny Cordray is here.
Oh, yeah. Only this time we will be okay.  [cell phone rings; Dwight's voice saying 'Idiot, Idiot, Idiot'] Oh, that's my new 'Dwight' ring.
That's the thing. It's very sturdy paper and on the back it says, '100% post-consumer content.' What? Hello? Uh-huh. Wait. What? I'm sorry, Mr. Decker. I think I'm losing you. [Shedder whirring] Hello? Hello? Yeah. Hold on one second. I don't know. Hold on one second.
I know, I mean the way I see it is you can deface any picture of me, any one, pick one. Not my kid though.
Huh, you think she is jealous about having a baby?
I can't do that. You won't be able to breathe.
Last week, I finally told Pam about the other job I took in Philly...the side job. And she was so incredibly cool about it. And now I just wanna do something huge for her. Like if we were in some biker bar and she mouthed off to some bikers and they came lumbering over and I was like wham! [mimes punch] Gotta go through me first.
Alright I just have to ask now that we're public, um, is the magic gone?
That is not what I said, and, also, I am co-manager, meaning you are not the only manager anymore. I am also I co-manager.
Okay, you know what?  I am going to be, uh, setting the agenda here. Okay? Can everybody gather up, please? Important announcement. Very important announcement. I think this is a perfect opportunity for all of us to participate in some really intense, psychologically revealing conversations. So we're going to be playing Desert Island, umm, Who Would You Do?
Play by the rules. Dwight. All time favorite movie.
Awesome! Good to be back. The place looks really good.
How dare you? My family built this country, by the way.
[after tense pause] OK. Here ya go. [roughly hands Darryl his thermos]
[sneezes on Dwight, looks at camera] You're welcome.
[Carol walks through door looking upset] [waves] Carol.
[on phone] Absolutely.  I couldn't be more sorry about this.
Okay. Can we keep it on the early side, though? I got that thing in Scranton later.
[bounces ball off wall with Toby] So that's what this sound is all day.
This is way more than I make now.
I'm not bossing you around. I'm trying to do my job, which is sharing your job, so maybe we should just call David Wallace.
Oh, no, that's not this 'cause that's in��� March. Uh, this is just the NBA. Professional. Miami Heat, actually, so��� [sits on floor]
I'm just kidding. She told me about it.
Katy but you know what, don't try to sell me one. Okay, seriously 'cause I'm just here to learn.
Are you sure you once knew how to do this?
Just thought that I heard crying, moaning, or something in here.
I won't.  But, you will wash and buff our car.
Does the Department of Health know about this?
Alright, that's gonna do it for me tonight. Have a lovely evening.
That'd be great, thank you. [Erin throws package, it hits Kathy. She thinks it was Jim who threw it]
Oh, here she is. Careful, careful, whoa. Alright, easy. Almost there.
No, of course we're not tourists. We're just people that aren't from here who are taking a tour.
15 feet from the baseline, so, you need me to move it in?
Oh, you mean handle it in person. Oh, well, Phyllis and Stanley have agree to cover for me while I���m gone.
Prima nocta, I believe from the movie Braveheart, and confirmed on wikipedia, is when the king got to deflower every new bride on her wedding night.  So...
Hey Pam, will you wait for me one second while I tie my shoe?
I think this is really gonna help. If you could just hold up here one second. [addresses the whole office] Hey, guys. Quick announcement. If I could just have everyone's attention. [turns back to Ryan] I just figured you needed a place where you can concentrate and not be bothered by bothering people.
[clears throat] Right to voicemail. [into phone] Hey, Ryan, it's Jim. You know what? Totally disregard that last voicemail, because you obviously have your hands tied. Good luck! [hangs up]
Oh, also, while you���re at it, if you did have a salt packet, three tacks and some aspirin, that would be great. Oh, wow. You have that.
Do we all have our copy of 'Threat Level: Midnight', by Michael Scott?
[interrupts Dwight trying to force feed Todd] Can I talk to you a second?
OK, you know what Dwight? We can't write our diseases down for you because that's confidential.
And that's why it's on my desk, Phyllis; it means a lot to me, and now that I know it was from you, it means even more.  Moving on!  Uh, ok, so that's the end of the tour for now, and if you liked it please tell your friends: 'Whenever you're in Scranton, visit Casa de la Halpert'.
Well, I should hope so. [Michael takes phone] Who is this?
Okay, I do. There like mini briefcases, alright?  Lots of guys have them.
Mine was actually a pretty boring case, so-
But I think it���s big enough to buy you some time till your next great idea���.which, by the way, I can���t wait for.
Come on man, just give it a couple days.  I think you'll be all right.
Go bag's in the car...  Keys, my keys, where's my keys?
[Jim and Gabe laugh, Toby smiles and nods] Oh.
I am just as much of a boss as Michael and I can do anything that Michael can do. Alright?  Who here believes that I have as much power as Michael? [Pam, after a moment,  is the only one who raises her hand]
Michael, can I talk to you in your office?
Yeah, right. I mean, unless they���re willing to pass some tests.
Good. Cause I have a lot of questions.
Hey, listen man, you can't take it personally.
[entering office] Hey. So, we saw a new billboard.
Wow. But then who would watch my TV? That is...
I would love, love, love to go. Only problem is, Pam's at home with the baby and I think she wants a night in.
Finger Lakes guy is good. Darryl is also very good.
Whatever. It's not a big deal. You know I always tell my three year old, if this is the worst thing that's gonna happen...[Jim bites his lip again] You gotta be kidding me! Ok! Pam! That's it, I'm going home!
[attempting to move car seat] It's like The Hurt Locker!
Okay, ladies and gentlemen, Welcome.  I know you're all very excited, but no matter who gets this, I just want to say that you are all employees of the monthin my eyes.  And the winner is, employee number nine.  And that is?
Oh, guys. I really refuse to participate. 'Michael, can I have an advance on my paycheck because a Mrs. Fields Cookie just opened up at the mall.'
Good eye - it's an oval.  [Andy compares his arm length to his side of the conference table] You're measuring the table.
[Opens folder and reads from Dwight's file] Last year, my boss, Michael Scott, took a day off because he said he had pneumonia, but really, he was leaving early to go to magic camp. Wow.
What are you doing? Last time I saw you, you were whipping me out of the building.
Oh yeah. I have the one that nobody has. Is there anything interesting?
[flashback to Beach Games] How are your feet?
Shuckin��� the peas. ��You should go back to the first part, though. You are ��gonna ��cover for me?
How far away did you think we were?
Uh, what happened to that video I sent you?
Okay, just wait one second, alright? I will copy it. Do you have a pen?
Believe it or not, Kevin, fire crackers are in the don't column.
It is really funny, but you know that can be confusing at a christening because you are not the godfather.
If this bad idea goes off and we all lose our jobs. Are you going to feel good about that?
The Stamford branch is closing and everybody's just packing up their stuff. Andy Bernard made these tasteful hats.
What about Darryl? We can all agree that he's a stand-up guy, right?
Yeah, I'd say she's happy. I mean, she loves her classes. Loves the city. I mean, last night, she was out with her friends, till, like, 8:00 AM.
You know, you can just pick it up, take the triple bogey.
No, I didn't. I took back my chair that you took from me, but I didn't take your chair.
[seeing Cece gone from the couch he left her] Uh, MeeMaw, where's Cece?
Hey! Can I talk you? For a second?
I think you need to go a little easy. You can't just suspend someone form work.
Well, it would have been. So unprofessional, Mrs. Halpert.
[As he's walking out] That's enough, I'm done! Okay? Agh!
I know it's not definite or whatever, but uh, do you know who's coming over here from Scranton?
Oh, I can't because I keep them hidden. I don't want to look at them and get cocky.
This is my biggest sale of the year. They love me over there for some reason. I'm not really sure why but I make one call over there every year, just to renew their account, and that one call ends up being 25% of my commission for the whole year, so I buy a mini bottle of champagne, celebrate a little. And this year I'm pushing recycled paper on them for one percent more. I know. I'm getting cocky. Right?
Get up. All right? I'm not gonna let you by.
Let's see, since I saw you an hour ago?
Well, it doesn't mean I can't drink it.
You know what though, I've actually seen ads for nurses that you can hire by the hour, for parties and bachelor events.
It was, uh in the authentic design, right? So I mean, you really felt like Michael Jordan was wearing these shoes, so ...
Wait. What are you writing? Don't write Ebola or mad cow disease. Right? 'Cause I'm suffering from both.
I'm very excited to see Brian. Brian's a great guy. And Pam and I have gotten really close to he and his wife, Alyssa over the years. And he got fired for protecting my wife from a jerk in the warehouse. I'm sorry, but you know him. He's a good guy.
[enters breakroom] Hey. Sorry about Dwight, by the way.
[Jim and Pam are walking outside] I just don't understand the desire to push sweet potato fries on me, and not just regular fries.
It's ringing. Does anybody have his name? Quick.
But are you a hundred percent sure? I don't think any of us are.
How many words per minute does the average person type?
You realize you're not actually talking to me, right?
Ok. Who else has heard the rumor that I am not as much in charge as Michael? [everyone raises there hands - including Pam]
[On the phone with Dwight] Hi, Dwight, um, what sort of discounts are we giving on the 20 lb white model.
Ow! Ow! Okay, that is three, and you didn't hit anybody that hard.
Uh, well, it took me a while, but I finally realized that I can���t give 100% to two things at once you know.
I'm sorry, I thought you were making a joke.
Oh, don't worry about it. Dwight, its okay. You were wrong.
So, that's still going on, huh? You and Kelly?
The new receptionist is also named Kelly. So Kelly Kapoor has decided to hover around my desk, so that she can run into his Charles' office every time he calls for Kelly. She thinks if she says 'You wanted me' enough, he will in fact want her. It's not the worse plan she's ever had.
Michael referred me to a male strip club called Banana Slings.  Instead, I called the Scholastic Speakers of Pennsylvania.
I don't know about Stephen King, I mean...
Hey. Wow. Just stopping by. Got another party to go to. A wife and two kids at home party.
No he doesn't.  You just get so nervous and hyper around him.
���Together we will win this baseball game against the evil space Yankees. Eat Fresh.���
How long is this? [flips through pages]  Oh, Pam. Good work! Oop, wait, stop.  Drawings.
[ahem] You can... [slightly effeminate] You can do it Ryan.
Um... Kevin, hands down. Yeah. He's really got that teddy bear thing going on, and afterwards, we could just watch bowling.
Oh yeah. I'm trying to move away from that. Getting into more of a bottled water phase.
Unfortunately, Jo also took the job away from you because she doesn't trust your judgment. So how would that look for me, if I recommended you?
Uh, actually, I haven't talked to her in a while.
You couldn't have taken off all your clothes in the men's room?
I just feel like after fifteen years at this company, bravo by the way, that we should celebrate with a very classy event, a night to remember.
So tell me again why I can't be part of your club?
Dwight really wants my bonus. He's trying to entrap me. Oh god, now I can't drink at this thing....I get really pranky when I drink.
Break me off a piece of that applesauce, I don't think...
Yes! [as other costumed actors come in and join Andy in song]
Yeah. Okay. Oh. I dare you to make an announcement.
I would love to hear the other mottos.
No. That is just a bunch of people participating in a collective thing that maybe the Eagles will hear about and want to play better. It's not...
This is great. Got to confess, we came a little early, so we got a quick look around, but, uh -
I hope not. [laughs] Because I am not going. Two question marks?
[pulls away beans] I'm really sorry. Pam must have put those out.
Um, well, we are all getting excited to see this fight. The Albany branch is working right through lunch to prevent downsizing, but Michael, he decided to extend our lunch by an hour so we could all go down to the dojo and watch him fight Dwight. Fight... Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, I'm coming, fight...
You totally have. You have earned this. But maybe I could be with my wife. Kind of the whole reason that I���m here.
The great speakers throughout history were not joke tellers. They were people of passion. So if you want to do well today, you got to do what they did.
Oh, no, sorry, it's an inside joke. There's this bartender at Stamford who, uh... you know what? You'd just have to be there.
Yeah! Like that rock opera! You could always do that right?
One more.  Why are you talking like that?
Well, that kind of sucks, because it had all the photos of my brother's new baby on it, so...
Well, I'll be the judge of that. What do you got?
I don���t know what you want me to tell you, man. All I know is that every time I���ve been faced with a tough decision, there���s only one thing that outweighs every other concern. One thing that will make you give up on everything you thought you knew, every instinct, every rational calculation.
What about music?  Do you have any music?
Really? Hey, Stanley, what was the last thing Michael said before I came through the door?
Yeah I think we have complimentary strengths. We understand each other.
[peering nervously through conference room window] Oh, I don't have anything to say. I'm just hiding from Dwight.
Ah, well I think I'm gonna see Katy.
[mimicking Stanley] I enjoy the tangy zip of Miracle Whip.
Oh, hey, how are you doing, I'm Jim.
We were thinking somewhere between five - ten thousand? I can do the full ten thousand. We should just - [blows air] - all in.
Dinner and a show, if you include Michael's movie. [Pam nods reluctantly]  And there was dancing and fireworks.  Pretty good date.
Hey, so how's the direct mail business going?
I promise...d other people that I would be on my worst behavior. And I gave them my word, so...
I'm really sorry if that's weird for you to hear, but I needed you to hear it. Probably not good timing, I know that. I just...
No, Michael, people are blindfolded. That's a hazard.
Hey, Troy, can you do me a huge favor?  Next time you see Ryan, can you tell him to check his messages?  That'd be great.
Wait, wait, where you going? I mean, even if you don't hire a band, you still have to watch the bands. Pam, these are people who have never given up on their dreams. I have great respect for that. And, yes, they're all probably very bad and that will make me feel better about not having dreams.
Wait, wait, wait. That's actually a really good idea Kelly.
All right, it will not happen again.  I promise.
So we're gonna say the most likely scenerio is that Michael matured overnight?
Oh, I should get back. Talk to you guys later.
I would love for everyone to just forgive me. But, if that's not happening, I'm not averse to just buying them all off.
Well, we���re here. Perfect. ��[covers sleeping Phyllis with his jacket]
Yeah. Sure. Sounds good. I... . [sees Pam in rearview mirror] Hey! You know what? Can I give you a call right back?
The... the... the... what I was saying is the real genius was...[car alarm blaring] was in the...
[Dwight hands Jim a piece of paper] Oh, what's this?
Uh, you know what, I gotta hop off because my, uh, taxi is here to take me to the meeting.
That might be a little difficult with the one computer.
[Jim slams lunchbag on table] I just totally blew a sales call.
I will get back to the rundown, uh, right now.
We present to you for your comments and approval, Dwight K. Shrute.
Is Ryan gonna fire me?  I don't know.  I know that I've done everything I can, and I just brought in a huge sale, and... am I insane, or was this kid a temp two years ago?  Because in the three years that he's been here, I think all he's ever done is start a fire and grow a beard.  And it's not even a good beard.
Stanley's very upset that we're leaving Florida. But he would back me up.
It is weird! Look at you, perceptive. Now I know why Jo's kept her eye on you!
No, I'm not worried. Because this lie isn't for me, it's for Pam. And when she gets her body back and her confidence back... yes, I will tell her the truth. That I had feelings for a co-worker today that I haven't had in years. But in my defense, he was grabbing my crotch fairly aggressively at the time.
Okay, 'A,' Halbert. And, 'B,' I think a more appropriate statement would be, 'The 'Halberts' are hosting an intimate reception for their invited guests.'
Oh, no, sorry. Just, um, we're kind of planners. But we're also flexible too, so you know what? Maybe we can just discuss it when the time comes.
I bought those boat tickets the day I saw that You Tube video.  I knew we'd need a back-up plan.  The boat was actually Plan C.  The church was Plan B and Plan A was marrying her a long, long time ago.  Pretty much the day I met her.
Nothing. Absolutely nothing. You're not holding a cup of coffee or anything are you?
And whoever comes up with the best idea gets a $50 gift certificate to the restaurant of his or her choice.  [everyone claps and makes comments]
Come on, man. She goes to New York in like 10 minutes.
Well, for starters, I've known you as a couple since the beginning of the relationship, which was approximately [looks a watch] three hours ago.
Jim Halpert. What? How did you get this number? Stalker.
Here's a 'not hypothetical'. I'm really happy I'm with Karen.
Yet here you are, back in a Laundromat.  Now, I'm just trying to help you, Beesly.  Be safe.
Sounds tough. When you're a Jet, [starts snapping] you're a Jet all the way, right?
I know, I know, I know. But Darryl and Kevin needed a third. They bought me this jersey. I said no. Kevin started crying. So, I am Chris Bosh.
Uh, excuse me, can I have everyone's attention for a second? First off, I just want to say that I'm really sorry, I didn't know that my absence last week would have been a burden on any of you, because, though I did have jury duty last week, they did dismiss me early on Monday. And I think you're going to find this pretty hilarious. I kind of, uh, well, maybe took the week off.
Now, would corporate approve a temporary price reduction for returning customers?
I think that you are able to take constructive criticism very well.
[on phone] Hey, Tom. What's that? Oh, you found a golden ticket. [puts hand on receiver and speaks to office] One of my clients found a golden ticket. [Michael screams in excitement] [Jim back on phone] Yup. No, congratulations. [Michael dances in background]
I should've grabbed you. I'm sorry. Look, I thought I could've done today's sales call alone. I mean, I may never be as good a salesman as you are, but I at least need the chance to do the job.
No, it- [high-pitched feedback as Jim starts to leave, feedback changes as he moves, turns over the mallard to see the listening devics, sighs, places mallard back on the desk]
Oh, ah, no but no. You know what let's go out. That was a good idea.  Let's go out.
Good Lord! [Photo of Cece on Jim's desktop] I can't believe I'm missing this.
I'm not gonna- [cuts himself off, Kevin walks in]
[to Jordan] Don't worry, the first day's always the hardest.
Umm, really, it's nothing, I was just talking to Angela, and she was --
You know what? You're sitting, and thinking, and it's probably better if it comes from me anyway.
Alright, alright, gang. Let's just settle down. You're yelling in her face.
Hypothetically. Hypothetically you were making out in the woods.
Please stop. People are having a Christmas party.
Angela, it���s Halloween. You have to sing ���Monster Mash���.
[chuckles] Yeah. That's what we're doing. In our very limited free time and with our very limited budget, we went and got a nanny and then we went out and took a class on a very outmoded and very unnecessary form of communication just so we could talk about you in front of you.
I need you to stay right here while you think about it.
She's seven pounds, two ounces, eighteen inches.  Mother and daughter are doing great.
Uh, you guys are going to love these. So, empanadas on me. You guys gotta try them.
You know, babe, I should have told you but... I did something bad.
Why wouldn't you see him?  You work for him.
Yeah. Big sale. Don���t worry about it though, I don���t really care about the points.  I would like a point receipt though���[on phone] Hey! Yes, this is Jim Halpert calling for Donald���can you hold on for one second? Thank you very much. [gets up to give Erin his point receipt]
[changes channel during commercial, sports scores appear on screen.]
If it's alright, can I just have like one minute alone, just to go over --
So that he can have us rob a bank, and then escape through the sewers.
[grabs Pam by the arm] Can I talk to you for a second?
Getting my wife a week off from work.
It's the weirdest thing. Every time I cough, he folds.
Oh wow, that sounds like fun. Is your friend named Karen too?  What did she accomplish?
All right, so I'll finish up on bulk pricing, and then you go into delivery guarantee.
All right, I am connecting and ... you are not there. Did you install it right? How about this:  Go to applications--
Sorry, Gabe, but that show hasn't been on in many cookies.'
Some might even say that we had our first date last night.
Alright guys. You know how we all like the red licorice but it's always buried behind like a ton of black licorice? [points to pile of candy] Bought it all. Now it's like red city in there. So, enjoy it.
You know what it���s not my best. Because you could just easily bend over and pick it up right?
Dwight, I'm in charge when Michael's gone, and I need you to sit...
[on the phone] Thank you. [hangs up the phone] The police are on it. They say they've already had three calls.
Oh really? Who's gonna take you in? You're messy. You're a klutz, you spill everything. And you leave the volume on the TV way too loud.
I've gotta go, but you know what? Team Halpert, ok? You're gonna crush it, you're gonna smash it.[Pam laughs] OK, good luck!
Yes. I am the popular social networking site known as Book Face.
Okay guys, not every glance means something, alright? Life isn't Downton Abbey.
I just think I should tell you that... I've sort of started seeing someone. And uh...
Here you go again! What is your deal today?
Dwight says that he actually doesn't know one single fact about bear attacks.
[reads demerit] 'Jim Halpert, tardiness.' Ugh. I love it already.
What? You're in Florida? Andy, Nellie Bertram's trying to take your job.
Yeah, oh, I know. Looks great. [Dwight throws the purse over his right shoulder and gets back to work]
OK, first of all, they've mostly worked, so-
[drawing two family trees on a whiteboard] Jan is about to have a baby with a sperm donor. And Michael is preparing for the birth of a watermelon with Dwight.  Now, this baby will be related to Michael through [draws a question mark] delusion.
So I guess I can assume that was personal.
Could I have everyone's attention, please? I have some tough news, so I'm just gonna give it to you straight. Truth is, we only have so much money for raises this year, so the simple fact is some people will get raises, and some people won't. Now, what we've decided is, we are gonna give those raises to the sales staff.
[looks bored. Taps finger on desk. Head falls to desk]
Oh yeah, how long's this meeting going to last?  [Stanley mumbles, looking at his watch]
[cracking up at the stupidity of it, the rest of the office besides Michael and Holly are concealing their laughter. Pam Is trying to quiet Jim up] Sorry.
Okay, that is a 'no' on the on the West Side Market.
Is that what you were here for? A crystal wizard? I like it.
Uh, no. No whorehouse. This is Dwight���s night, okay?
Okay! First of all, stop using my name.  And second of all-
Right, okay.  Yes, that would be the smart thing to do.  Uh, Pam, I will be right back.
[dancing with Pam. They kiss] See, now you don���t owe me anything.
Look, it has sentimental value, Dwight. Can I buy it from you?
...and Pam was just going crazy, trying to take care of Philip because Cece has been out of control recently, and- look, Andy, it doesn't matter. The truth is, I just feel terrible lying to you.
Alright, well, I will see you in a bit.
I really wish I could help. I'm not really sure how I can...
Gettin��� a lot of mileage out of this, aren���t ya?
No, we talked about not bringing them in to Dwight's photo studio slash trap.
Oh, right, because you announced that his ship was sinking?
Dwight. This, [picks up balloon] fits in the palm of my hand. You haven't blown 'em up enough. Why have you chosen brown and gray balloons?
He's an amazing man. He's a Rhodes Scholar. He invented an app that invents apps. Fantastic kisser...
Honestly, I don't think Michael has the slightest clue of who he's gonna  fire. I think he keeps hoping that someone's going to volunteer. Uh, or be run over by a bus before the deadline. But in the end, really, what's going to happen is it's gonna be the first person to give him a dirty look in the hall. And therein lies the true essence of his charisma.
Great. [to a group of guests]  Just wanna let you guys know that we will be taking the tour like I promised-
Hey, I know what you're looking for, but um, I got to be honest, I really don't think I should be considered as your replacement.
No one will believe this back home, but that's okay. Let me show you how it's done.
Well, maybe it isn't warm enough in here.
No, no, I think it was more like, 'you know, I liked him, but I don't anymore because he did a bad job, so I'm definitely gonna yell at him'.
Dwight, will you go back to the hospital? You were there for like three hours.
Oh man, that's crazy.  Right as we were on our way out too.
Meredith was the perfect choice to play the head of the company. Her lunch break lined up with our appointment with Danny and...that's it. That's really all we were looking for.
That reminds me, uh, if the invitation still stands, Pam and I would love to have dinner tonight.
A man sitting several seats down, who has a gold face, turns to Michael Scarn. [out of character] Uh... Ooh, Oscar, you wanna play Goldenface?
Dwight, why don't we just hold off with the human pyramids for a while?
Hey, Phyllis, Do you have any games that you play in the office?
Okay.  Sshh.  I know.  [hands the baby to Pam]
[to Pam] ...so I talked to the scout, it looks good.
I'm just saying with the NBA lockout I think roller derby's in a really good place now. So���my pitch is���me, Pam, you and, someone else maybe Justine.
What?! You have a cake. You have a delicious cake, with your name spelled correctly?
Oh my God, Karen, you're right, that is Animal from the Muppet Babies.
Yeah, I was just doing a little joke there about how we'd never met...
Before me stands your coworker, Dwight Kurt Schrute. Dwight, show them all sides. Turn around. Now, today, we need your help turning Dwight into a gentleman.
Yeah, absolutely.  Do people like sitting next to you? You���re clean, right?
Five minutes actually.  I am a black belt in gift wrapping.
I'm not gonna go tell Phyllis that she can't be Santa.
[Overlapping] When's the last time you upgraded your printer?
[as Dwight tries to take paper out from under him] Hey, can you not?
Quick announcement everybody, if I could have everybody's attention.  We do have wine in the kitchen, and, uh, there is beer available on the porch and despite what you might think, it's not all for Meredith and Kelly, so please enjoy.
I did not love the dialogue. Or the character.  I took the role to impress a receptionist who will remain nameless.
[swats over various photos and knickknacks, points at paperwork] Is this yours or mine?
Wait a second, how are you qualified for that?
Definitely not.  If anything it was a tie.
Nope. Social club. God, I hate when everybody calls us a rebellion. [Darryl enters and brandishes his fist, Jim returns the gesture]
Oh, Dwight, you're trying too hard, and that's just not classy. You see, the thing about classy is it's a state of mind.
[to the buyer] Hold on a second. [to Pam] The last few months have meant the world to me and all I care about���
[Pam starts sipping an empty glass] I think those might be empty.
Stanley. Uhh��� you know what? Just bring back those bottles!
That was the moment that you knew you liked me?
No. [Andy gets up from his desk] Stay there. Kev, thought we nailed the whole transfer thing earlier.
You know, when I saw Dwight, I realized how stupid and petty all those pranks I pulled on him were. And then he spoke. I wonder how hard it would be to get a copy of his room key.
One second 'cause that sounds really good. Is jackass one word or two? [Dwight sighs] One, right? 'Cause, 'cause of the show, it's one.
Um, this one interesting the power comes from the font in this one. 'Schrute Space,' very medieval, very England. Um, this one's forceful, this one's very Dwight. 'Quiet! Dwight Schrute Working,' it's good.
Having a baby is as exhausting as they say it is. Having two babies [holds up index cards] - that's just unfair.
Wait, wait, wait. Pam. No. Do you understand? The... the game is Desert Island Movies, not guilty pleasure movies. Desert Island Movies are the movies you're going to watch for the rest of your life! Forever! Unforgivable.
Andy, we're gonna do our best. But you know what? At the end of the day seven point...whatever percent is pretty good.
Once a quarter, the sales staff at this branch has to stay late to do order form consolidation... which, amazingly, is even less interesting than it sounds.
But listen, I'm going to have to talk to her a lot. All right? And there may be chatting, and giggling. And you gotta just pretend to ignore it. Wipe it away.
Well, I don't think I'll be here in ten years.
I wouldn't... I wouldn't worry about it. Don't touch it.
[puts his phone in his coffee mug and calls Gabe]
Oh, nothing. I just feel bad. I feel like things were a little weird today... or something.
Okay, okay, it's no big deal.  So you're not a computer geek.
Oh, yeah, How have we not talked about this already? I mean what happened there? Kidnapping? [both start laughing]
She looks at it when she���s on the potty, and she makes the faces.
I don't know maybe being a good dad is just all in your own compass. I don't know, I don't know. Thank you!
Okay, just so I understand it, in your wildest fantasy you are in Hell and you are co-running a bed and breakfast with the devil?
You know what? Can I have the weekend to decide?
A7557962.' Totally nonsense numbers, but you do what you have to do.
What? My shoe is untied. What is your problem? [Pam laughs] Oh my God, you thought I wa--- oh.
Wait, wait, wait! Stop! Stop! Stop! Will you stop?! [Kelly and Erin screaming as Dwight bashes their heads together, everyone attacking each other and yelling]
I don't know though. I mean, you know that was a hit.
How about we just... Just have to talk to you for a second...
OK, so there's no defense for that, good to know.
Whoa. How did you know that I was gonna���
Don't. [quietly] I have information about the sex predator.
That's sad. Or it's innovative. Well, you know the futon is a bed and couch all rolled into one. [Jim sees Roy and trails off]
[hands expense report to Oscar] Here you go. All done.
Sorry it didn't work out. Hope you find what you're looking for.
I think I'll see you at the mall. Yeah.
Oh! Right! Right, right, right, come-ah on, on, on. [to everyone] Ladies and gentlemen! Gather around! We have one more participant. Come on, be polite. Be polite. [to Katy] Desert Island. Five movies. Go.
Maybe we should just wait and find out.
[Meredith's hair is on fire] Oh, oh, oh, oh!
I care about them and I'm just as much of a boss as Michael. [Stanley laughs] What's so funny? I'm a co-manager.
Because most of the time, friends don't talk about other friends' butts.
That bread on your desk? I just picked it up. It's white hot.
Okay, you know what, next time, I'll let you get the cake and I get to scream at the birthday girl.
Yeah, just keep your eye on Dwight, great.
Oh, Somebody went in. That was a team effort, Pam.
Yeah, I think you're going to want to cool it with that 'cause it's starting to upset the other salesmen.
[hits ball, ricochets to groin] Ah! Classic, right? [Jim continues to rally poorly and falls down]
Well, you know what Dwight? He's your work boss, okay? He is not your relationship boss.
[looks in  the refrigerator] Hey Dwight, my tuna sandwich isn't in the refrigerator. You wouldn't know anything about that would you?
[as Pam stares at him] I can feel you looking at me.
Right! [Jim laughs as he answers the phone] Hey, what's up? Everything ok?
The big gun thing. [Dwight grabs at phone] Stop!
I'm just saying that you can't be sure that is wasn't you.
Oh, I'm sorry. Are you sitting here now?
Oh, this is just something I'm taking a break with.
The salesmen have a commission cap, but we figured out a way around it.
Okay, so is it like sales or... accountants?
It's so weird, she was saying it just before you got here.
No. No, no. Just um... some personal stuff. And I'm not really ready to revist that, I don't think.
Thank you. I like being appreciated. But, to speak my truth, it wasn't out of the way because I felt like a tea anyway. So, one trip.
Dwight, listen: no matter what happens, you gotta forget about all the other stuff. You gotta forget about logic and fear and doubt. You just gotta do everything you can to get to the one woman who���s gonna make all this worth it. At the end of the day, you gotta jump. You love Angela, Dwight. I think you always have.
And that's really sweet. And you can think that. But you don't say that out loud, and you definitely don't say it to her.
Ok, Dwight. We can't do that. So why don't you just tell us what happened?
Well I think if you use the same jokes it just comes across as lazy.
I didn't tell anyone! Who did you tell?
Thank you, Mr. Schnoot. [closes his binder] We will let you know.
I'm actually really disappointed in how poorly my book is doing. [holds up same book] I've only sold one copy.
Hey Kev, what were you saying before about the paperwork?
[partially blown up balloons on table and hanging from streamers] Are you kidding?
You know he's doing all this on purpose.
Dwight, you can���t just hire someone ���cause they���re your friend.
Yeah, sure, but... who's been saying all that stuff?
[whispering to Pam in corner of room] So, they know.
[walking out of the building] Hey, do you mind if we make a stop on the way home?
Hey uh, Michael.  Don't jump on the bouncy castle.  You can't do that, because you're going to get horribly, horribly injured.
No, don't worry about it.  We'll just got double or nothin'.
Okay, everybody, I was just making a joke. I am taking it seriously, I promise.
Yup, looks like the Scranton people and the Stamford people are finally coming together. And that's what you want, right?
[goes to hand Dwight a valentines card] Wait.
Could you guys all do me a favor and not talk about this until I tell Pam?
Well on the plus side all this worrying about China has made you smarter than Oscar, Michael.
And Beesly. Tonight we're in two seperate rooms and tomorrow night is the honeymoon suite.
What? [Karen's player shoots Jim's player, 'You killed Jim Halpert' appears on the screen, Karen giggles]
At the Stamford branch, they all play this World War II video game called Call of Duty, and they're all really into it.  I'm told it started as a team building exercise.  Unfortunately I really suck at it.  We didn't play many video games in Scranton.  Instead we'd do stuff like, uh, Pam and I would sometimes hum the same high pitched note, and try to get Dwight to make an appointment with an ear doctor.  And uh, Pam called it... Pretendenitus.
Hey. I was just about to call you.
Um, I had asked Michael if I could head up the Oscar investigation and he said that only Dwight was capable of handling such sensitive material.
Uh, this Wallace guy is lookin' at hard time. And we only know this because of what Dwight Snoot said on record!
When I was ten years old, my parents took me to Disney world. I cried the whole time. I was not able to comprehend the beauty that was before me. ��I just wanted... to go home. ��This is what the Pyramid will do for you. It is the bridge to the world. It has a usb port. Wireless... will be available in 2013. ��You can play Anything from Chuck to Cars 2. With the Pyramid, you have the connection to everything -- in time... and space.
Why don't we take a quick ten second break from that so I can show you what's going on here. [pulls up Dwight's game] Okay, this is Dwight's Second Life. He's on it all the time. So much so that his little guy here has created his own world. It's called Second Second Life, for those people who want to be removed even further from reality.
Hypothetically, if I thought Pam was interested, then... No, it's totally hypothetical.
Later, Kev. [Puts French Onion Potato Chips on Pam's desk] Have a good weekend.
Wait, wait; one thing.  Uh, by tomorrow, you mean Saturday, right?
As ranking number two, I am starting a committee to determine the validity of the two committees and I am the sole member. The committee will act on this now.
Yeah, hi. Is Mr. Decker around? Oh, well, could you just have him call me after lunch? Thank you.
Turns out, a lot of parents want the very best for their children. That's weird.
Today we will be testing candidates for the position of assistant to the assistant to the regional manager.
You making this up as you go along, aren't you?
I'm sorry to hear about that. Who is this about?
Dwight, I uh, I have something to confess.
OK. Now, what do we got in these two pails?
OK, whoa. 'Cause that is a pretty intense accusation. How do you know that they're fake?
[starts a stopwatch as Dwight yawns, stops it when Dwight is done] Yawn.  Four seconds.
I'm actually just looking for my Blackberry, so, carry on.
[Dwight and Jim are playing ping-pong, and Dwight scores] What the hell?
Oh wow. This is my niece Vanessa. She's a trumpeter. And, look at her.
Do you think I'm calling you for your best approximation?
Mmmhmm. And the first thing they teach you is that you've got to be true to your self. And you are all about authority.
Well, then why are you wasting everybody else's time interrogating them?
I'll get you a napkin. Someone get napkins please!
Dwight, sometimes it takes couples years to get pregnant.
Fair enough. Wow! We should have started dating like a long time ago.
Oh, no, it was... you know, a good opportunity for me, a promotion. I got a chance to...
Yeah, you did win. You did win. Anyway, I'm going to need three copies of each of these, stapled and collated. [begins to walk away, then turns back] Totally kidding. [leans in, whispers] I'm gonna need four. [kisses Pam]
That must have been extremely uncomfortable for your mom.
And we would love to have you. But not today. Unfortunately, it's a bad day, what with Operation Overthrow and everything, but I have noted it.  [Dwight tears the sign down, Jim hangs two signs in its place]
Dwight, you wrote that memo. Okay, it's not an official memo.
[long pause and then he sighs and nods] Yes.
OK, can you hold on? I'm getting the, ah, beep. [presses button on phone]] Jim Halpert.
[Michael walks in] Oh, hey, Michael. Listen, I brought up those sales targets.  Do you want to-
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know what the best play is. Do we tear everything up, or do we buy a horse on the Internet? I mean, I don't know what to do. What do you think?
[sighs] Oh, so Dwight gave me this wooden mallard as a gift, and I found a recording device in it. Yes. So, I think if I played it just right I can get Dwight to play out the plot of National Treasure.
Dwight, you know what, just back up, okay, that's making me uncomfortable. This is sexual harassment, by the way. Oh my God! He's got a knife!
Hi, all right. I'm just going to go down to the car and I'm going to put her in her seat and I'll be right back up.
Heh. We think that 25 cents a mile is pretty generous.
Okay, easy. Trust me, I'm around for the long-haul.
[Sighs] I'm having second thoughts about one of the shirts I packed. The blue one with the stripes.
Tom Witochkin. One of my best buddies, actually.
I feel like there's a chance for me to start over. And if I fall back into the same kind of things I used to do., then ... what am I doing?
Ah... would you want to do it on Groundhogs day?
By the way, they do need an extra day next week.
Wow, what a surprise. That's crazy. You guys get to meet the little heck-raisers.
That's it. I think we should do it the Lethal Weapon way.
Well, you know, the first performance was a little off.  But I really think they hit their stride, in the second show.  Um, might even bring my parents tomorrow, to the matinee.
This is really not how this is supposed to happen.
...Oh, you know what? ... It was... gonna be Pam, but...
That's moving boxes. We just came up with the term to make it sound cooler.
You guys obviously went through some tough times leading up to it.
[sarcastically] Well, obviously. Too bad he's a temp and doesn't count, so let's get started. [starts to write on a piece of paper]
Seriously? You're going to sit in the back?
I don't know. Hey, have you seen my baby?
Wow! That is really hard. You really think you can go all day long? Well, you always left me satisfied and smiling, so...
Oh, uh, is it too late to get in?
And as you know, I was a paper salesman. [whispers to Darryl] Hey, I find it helps if you just picture everybody naked. [group overhears and chuckles]
Final lap. Final lap. Time to beat is 1:15.
You know what?  I'm just going to call a cab from here.
Listen Michael, I really... I did text Pam, but...
How did you get this number? Michael, we're on a catamaran.
Okay, wait, I was not... I did not-
It's not even real yet. And I'm not gonna tell her 'til it's real.
Can I have a ride, man? I... uh... I have my bike.
All right so now we can sit... and get comfortable.
I think today was a good day to have two managers.  'Cause if you're a family stuck on a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean, one parent might want to just keep rowing.  But if the other parent wants to play a game, it's not because they're crazy.  It's because they're doing it for the kids.  And I get that now.
[tackled by Dwight] What are you doing? No. No, no, no.
But if the company doesn't go under then we'll finally have all our contacts in one program.
Wow, what do you put our chances at?
Hey Kev, that looks good. What is it? Turkey?
[seeing Dwight wearing sunglasses and whose face and hands are completely covered in gauze] Oh, I know this guy. [Dwight awkwardly hands copies of his resume to the Search Committee] Hello! Mr. 'Soo-ven-yay.' Mr. 'Jacques Soo-ven-yay.' Nice to meet you. It says here you're French. [Dwight nods] So you worked at your last job for 15 years as Assistant to the Regional Manager.
How would that work in well?  I just want to know.
No, dude, no, I was just, listen! Whoa.
No guys his name's not Hank, it's ah, is it Edgar?
Hey, dude, leave him alone. What are you doing?
Where do I want to go? Um... that is an excellent question. And one I should have probably thought about before I called you. Um...
Oh, come on. Not even Roy will have hot dogs at his wedding.
You know what you should do? You should quit. And then, that would stick it to both of them.
You know, Andy, you could just say a really nice goodbye.
Quick question--Do you just decide who gets what in the moment, or did you make a list?
[on Pam's answering machine] Hey, Pam... it's Jim. Um, I have a doctor's appointment in the city. So I probably won't be in till the late afternoon. Just thought I'd let you know. Okay, bye. [camera shows Jim sitting on a waiting coach in another Dunder Mifflin office]
So, Dwight thinks that tonight is a surprise party for Michael.
Ok. Right. Oh, so this morning we are having breakfast together and I just looked up from my cereal and I said, ' You know what I want to do today? I want to marry you.'
Uh, what does -- what does that mean?
The dawn goose walk will tug at your heartstrings.
Hey man, you mind if I run something by you?
Well it's a computer Dwight, computers have wires.
No, you what, seriously, you should have it.
We can offer our biggest discounts on 30% recycled and ultra-premium laser.
Yes, we are supposed to look for every chance to acknowledge and appreciate each other's sacrifices. Because I need to appreciate what Pam's been doing to run the house while I'm in Philly.
We tried to find the fairest way to do it.
I ain���t fraid of no ghost. [Pam holds up drawing of a hand with the middle finger raised] Whoa!
No, let's let her rest.  I'm sure there's still twelve on each.
I... Why would you just say something like that?
[entire office is chatting] I'm saying, all I'm saying is Kevin is not necessarily a feminist, is all I'm saying.
Uh, how did you know they were black belts?
Come on. Get out there. Give the people what they want.
[on the phone] We have that going out Tuesday... Okay? Sure, no, I can... I'll double-check that for you.
Hope you didn't have any major laundry issues.
I think she'd be a really good salesperson.
Alright, let me just say good-bye to Pam.
Oh! Um... tonight, actually? No. I'm uh just still getting settled.
It was a little glass display case for his for his bobblehead.  That would have made us even, I think.  He saves my life, I get him a box for his desk toy.  Even Steven.
Who says no moustache? [Jim, Angela, and Phyllis raise their hands; Gabe enters, hiding Stanley's face]
Um, actually it's, it's for your own good. I think maybe we should- [gestures toward hallway]
Ahhh... just have so much paperwork to do. [exhales] Wow. Done. Okay, let's do it.
Are you sure you���re okay with me putting in this much money.
Um... 'Fifty signs your priest might be Michael Jackson.'
Oh, this Man In Black thing, what do you think that was about?
...well I'm going to call corporate to make sure that they know I didn't lose half my sales.
Listen to me. Robert is going to veto the Sabre store.
Maybe if you make fun of yourself it'll all go away.
And she's trying to correctly butcher a goose, but she's having trouble coming up with it.
See, you're always saying there's something wrong with society, but... maybe there's something wrong with you.
And seriously, it's totally not a big deal, ok? And when I found out you were engaged, I mean.
Good, and it absolutely is a toy. Arigatou.
Wow.  I guess word got around.  That's a nice... honor.
Phyllis by a nose. Gold medal in Flernenton.
You know Dwight, if you didn't want me to go the smart move would be to tell Andy that I actually am essential to the operation. That way I couldn't go.
[Michael is seen debating on whether to come back in to the office] Remember that older couple whose kids were also named Jim and Pam?
What time is it here? Um, we're in the same time zone.
We are splitting a sublet on a place near Philly.
It's so scary how right the things you're saying are. And you're coming at it with almost no knowledge, so of course I trust your opinion on this.
Oh.  He's going to kill himself, pretending to kill himself.
I have to.  Pam, if I'm not there, someone's going to go to jail.  Or die.
Wait, so, you don't go into shock or die or anything?
Take it slow. 'Cause it seems like a lot of the time things like that need... [Ryan walks in]
[laughing] She's probably going to, cause they sit next to each other.
You should actually thank Erin, she's the one who agreed to babysit.
Well not until Friday 20% off toner cartridges, that's a big deal.  While we're on the subject, why don't I just run you down to the hospital and we'll just do a quick check?
Con-- no one gets as much as they did last year.
[snickers at Pam's sketch] That is pretty cool.
[starts chanting] Vol-de-mort, Vol-de-mort ...[Kevin and Karen follow] Vol-de-mort! Vol-de-mort! Vol-de-mort!
Around here, Oscar is known as 'actually' because he will insert himself into just about any conversation to add facts, or correct grammar. He really does fit that old stereotype of the smug gay Mexican.
All right.  You're right, sometimes when she's tired, she can be a little bit shrill.  But that's not a weird voice.
It's like magic. Or, it's like me getting on my hands and knees and begging my partners to switch a Tuesday for a Thursday.
Mike Tibbets is like the most boring-looking guy I know. So if that was for the matchmaker test, I think I'm in the clear. If that wasn't for the matchmaker test, then... Cathy, he's a really nice guy.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I just meant I wanted to pay to have fireworks at the party.
Okay. I���m really sorry I told the guys I���d be there for the board meeting.
You got to take a chance on something sometime, Pam. I mean, do you want to be a receptionist here, always?
Swore I wouldn't tell anyone this, but in the interest of revealing secrets. Oh my God, this will make your brain explode. Umm, Dwight and Angela dating. Have been for six months.
Because we're strong, Dwight. Because we're strong. God, it's freezing, I gotta go in. You stay though for like five minutes.
All right. [to Pam] I should probably get back to work. Get back to work.
Oh, man I don't know. Uh, dinner, drinks, movie, matching tattoos.
Maybe, but... we're gonna need somebody to create a diversion, and...
Yeah, but, Michael, the point is that we all bought gifts for specific people.
Here we go. [Meredith's phone rings. Jim and Andy groan.]
Yep. Because Kelly is Indian and... oh, that's it.
Guys. Michael can't handle this and as your boss I'm saying we're not watching it.
Oh. OK, well you know what, I um, just call me later.
Now, is it too dark to say that Cici's having an operation?
Well I think enemy's a strong word. 'Cause I think we have a really charming back and forth. And-
A commission cap takes away my incentive to sell. So you realize I now have no reason to work, right?
I called the manufacturer, who referred me to distributor, who referred me to the vending machine company, who told me that they sell them in the machines in the building next door.
Don���t get me wrong, I am definitely here for Pam. But this is an awesome added bonus.
I am currently reading incoherent riddles on blue index cards to find vital information that Michael has hidden all over the office. How are you?
Would you write down your e-mail because I have just so many questions...
We should help him out. [Jim and Pam each take a French fry, eat it, and then look toward the bathroom]
[on phone] All right, I will fax over it to you. Whoop. I will fax it over to you. Okay. Thank you. [chuckles]
[reading from computer] ���Side effects of EMF include: headaches...���
Trust me, this is the least of all evils. It took me all day to pull this off, so you should be thrilled, considering.
Rarely.  If ever.  Let me give it a whirl.  I'll talk to them.
Yes, it is very stressful. You sure everything's okay?
Yeah, I filled out the expense reports. That took about five minutes and then I closed two sales at lunch time. So, about as productive as any other day. If not more so.
Sure, yeah. [laughs] Hollywood. [Ryan Howard pulls out 3 thick scripts] Alright.
We are here today, not to immortalize a man, but an idea... Maybe the idea of a man.
Mmmhmm.  Why don't you start by telling me what you got.
It reminds me of the orientation video showed on my first day. 'The Scranton Witch Project'.
Really what it is, is about the money the sales staff brings into the office.
[to Pam] Oh, you know what? Sorry, forgot to tell you. I intercepted a transmission earlier and it seems that the CIA is gonna need Dwight down at their headquarters in Langley for training and an ice cream social with the other agents.
Just give me one second. I'm just gonna grab something to eat.
Did I ever tell you why I left Scranton?
But best case scenario, you thought it was a quarter.
Yeah, that's what I'm saying. They're incredibly helpful, you're lucky to have them. I mean with them there, you probably won't even know I'm gone.
Yeah, who'd have thought? [Pam sees fireworks being set up; smiles]
[points at paper on desk] What does 2005 season mean?
[on cell phone] Great. Yeah, I'll see you next week. Thank you, and here is Karen Filipelli. Bye.
[after Pam has another contraction]  That's seven minutes.  Here we go.  This is happening.  Come on.
Oscar, what do you wanna do, this is kinda your deal. You wanna dog?
Okay, the limo���s gonna be here at five.  I need everybody to be ready ���cause I want to pack in a lot.
For now, yeah. I was spreading myself way too thin���
Yeah. I just don't think this is the kind of task, that I... am going to do. You know who would be great for this?
That's honest. [sighs] Alright, fair enough. It was really fun while it lasted though, wasn't it?
It's a pretty good idea, don't you think?
Thanks guys. All right, here we go. Let's go.
You���re gonna do great. And you know what? Mommy���s gonna record it. So we���ll watch it together. Do you mind doing that, Pam?
what is interesting? I just proved that he gives his cell out to everybody.
That's okay. [Hannah shows pic of husband naked with baby] Oh, no, it's not. I'm sorry, is that your husband in the tub with him?
[aims imaginary camera at Pam] Click. Oh, you blinked. Damn it. Now that's in my brain forever.
What was I gonna- What was I gonna say?
Which we realize sounds crass, but, it... is his favorite number.
Well, you know how I like taking bribes. [both smile]
He's trying to set you up Michael. What's going to happen is he's going to try and bring up what ever you're talking about in a very casual way, but secretly he'll be trying to trip you up, and when he does, boom, its awful. Haven't you noticed that I don't bring up the Tour de France around him?
You can't fire me. You're acting manager. Not office manager. So you have no firing powers.
[to Cece] Hi. [to everyone] All right. Travel safe, Angela.
All right, what the heck? Let's do it.
I do. That's what I'm best known for. Sitting out there. Alright, let's talk about purses.
Yeah. Hey, can I talk to you about something?
And then an older gentleman asked you 'Boxers or briefs?'
I'm gonna help you through it all right?
I don't think we have to do this again cause it's gonna take a whole. [everyone clinks glasses]
Hello? [laughs] No, I'm just on the phone with this stupid salesman. He's so dumb. Probably just gonna keep him on the line forever and not buy anything. Yeah, OK. [punches button on phone]
The bat, I mean, I know I felt it bite me, but look. There's no mark. I feel so... tingly... so strangely powerful... [shrugs] Oh well.
That is cool. Well, I'll see you Monday though, right?
Hey, would you mind coming out here for a second? I just have something for you.
Pam, he's in a box. He's downstairs, in a box, on the floor, near the shelves. I'm serious. Go down there and work your magic.
Well, we all handle it differently. I personally choose to handle it like a normal person, but...
Those reports affect our bonuses, which is kind of great for me, because you wouldn't know it from looking at her, but Pam's a gold-digger.
Okay alright. [gets up] I'm really sorry, uh, I just have to say it. I'm-I'm married. I'm very happily married.
Ah.  That... they might be off the hook for because I... didn't tell them.
[silently counting] Three, two, one... [Erin turns on the office lights, all laugh loudly]
Mose has been weird? That���s so unlike him.
Yes! Phyllis! [claps] Phyllis, just put your foot right through here [lifts strap on box of paper]. Right through the flonk.
You did not have sex with Pam's mom.
I'm not really sure what movie you're talking about. Are you sure you got the title right?
Alright, wait, little bit of backstory, she loves dogs. She calls them 'da-das'.
Listen, guys, I think we all want to know the same thing, right? Who���s the strongest? Well, there���s only one way to solve that ��� flat curl contest.
Oh.  Yeah well, I guess there's been a couple late nights. Karen and I have been up talking.
Nope. I think that was it. [Dwight gets up and walks away]
Well, I mean, that's OK. It doesn't mean that it's over. Right? I mean, couples fight.
If you want to come back then, that'll be fine.
This... is Parkour. [turns laptop to camera, shows Parkour instructional video] Internet sensation of 2004. And it was in one of the Bond films. It's pretty impressive. [Michael is shown climbing/walking on various objects in office] The goal is to get from point A to point B as creatively as possible, so technically they are doing Parkour, as long as point A is delusion and point B is the hospital.
You have to fire the salesman that treated me so terribly.
[on phone]  Hi, yeah.  This is Mike from the West Side Market.  Well, we get a shipment of Herr's salt and vinegar chips, and we ordered that about three weeks ago and haven't ... . yeah.  You have 'em in the warehouse.  Great.  What is my store number... six.  Wait, no.  I'll call you back. [quickly hangs up] Shut up [to Karen].
I don't know how we'd go about doing that.
But, you know what? I came up with something and I think it's really gonna help.
Ahh... I got you some tiramisu. No hard feelings.
So... you're cool to just wait here for animal control?
Because you said 'do you wanna hang out'-
I just think that maybe they're eating large amounts of the day.
Ok, so promise that you'll wait till we leave the parking lot before you go to the bar.
Hey that's work, hold on. Hey Wade, did Cole Hamels call back or what? Great. Good.
Land. World. Uh, it's not that I don't want a-- well, yes, I guess I'd take a raise. That's not what I'm saying. That's not-- sorry.
I gotta make an example out of him. Should I just fire him?
Does it save time though? ���Cause we���ve been here for about an hour.
I didn't think you'd notice. [laughs nervously] Uh, it's funny actually, there's another salesman out here, Dwight Schrute, and he sent out this memo, as he always does, and, uh, it was about professionalism in the workplace. Of course, he singled me out. So I just had to mess with him.
No, I didn't. I just logged it in right here, so...
A toast, better make it good.  To avoiding a class two felony charge.
Okay, the man's worked here for 25 years. How can none of us picture his face?
Nope. I didn't, but let's go inside and I can call him right now.
I don't know. Grab a drink, I think?
Well, I don't know about the rest of you but I'm just gonna say it. I'm nervous. I have no idea what health problems this is all gonna cause. [group agrees, protests]
Yeah, it's no big deal, just something that looks like that. [shows Darryl a resume] Cool? [goes to put the resume away]
OK, I'm gonna go into this office here [gets up and walks into Michael's office] to do some work. So I will be in here.
Doesn't matter what the name is. Se��or Loadenstein, that's stupid.
Oh man, Ernesto's. That was our favorite restaurant too.
Yeah, well, you know just had a meeting. Squash meeting.
What I was saying is the genius of Air Jordan was not in the market saturation, it was in --
Oh, come on, it can always get better. Right?
Andy ��� this whole idea of our situation being just like war?  It���s just not true.  We just work at a paper company.  And you���re our regional manager.  And guess what man?  You don���t have to prove anything.  We like you as regional manager.  Andy if you don���t believe me take a look at what���s on my head.  I���m wearing a very pink hat.  I���ve been getting weird looks all day because I���m pretty sure ���DM does GB��� means something kinda sexual.  But guess who���s wearing them?  All of us.  Just for you man.  That���s huge.
You did not force me to do this.
At that moment, I was so happy. I mean, everything Dwight does annoys me.
Well, the car seat was to take her to the hospital, or...
Michael, I like the sound of your voice. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to buy one million dollars worth of paper products today.
Well, now you have a bus full of real..bilden..kin..
I wouldn���t be too sure about that. Just saying.
There's gotta be a better way to do this. This is literally how they built the pyramids.
I've been studying Michael for years, and I've condensed what I've learned into this chart-- [pulls out a pie chart] How Michael spends his time. As you can see, we have procrastinating and distracting others, and this tiny sliver here is critical thinking. I made it bigger, so that you could see it.
[sighs] I don't know what you want me to tell you. To be really honest, my wife works here. And I love it. She literally makes me work harder. She makes me smarter. She makes me remember why I'm here. And between us, she's on maternity leave right now, and I would love to leave this room and see her face. I would love it. I don't know how this helps, but it's just what I'm thinking.
Okay, stop. Forever stop that story. That's disgusting, and it doesn't count. So give me another one.
Oh, that's gonna be great. Who's Chuck Close?
Aw man, I would but I can't miss any more work.
We'll see.  I'm sure you guys will... find you way back to one another someday.
Michael, we only told our parents last week.
But you're comparing you and Luke to God and Jesus.
[watching Meredith and Michael talk in his office] They've been in there for 45 minutes.
Andy put down a bunch of deposits on stuff for his wedding with Angela, but then she was sleeping with Dwight for... several years. Wait, no, that can't be right.
What do you think? Tomorrow? Lunch, you and me?
Well, yeah, but I'm wondering if it's too blue. Like, am I making a statement with the blueness?
There's this thing that people tend to do with billboards. How do I put this? If there's an opportunity for a graffiti artist to work in a... phallic shape, interacting with the artwork, it'll happen, and Andy gave them that opportunity.
[wearing a tuxedo] I don't know. Is it classy enough?
OK, you know what? Why don't we just call animal control...
Oh, it was commercial break so I just wanted to check the scores.
You're not allowed to take off your pants in the middle of the office.
Alright, Charles, I've gotta be honest. I think we really got off on the wrong foot here. And, truth be told, I'm a pretty smart guy, and, uh, a hard-worker.  And a great number two for the office.
I've never really been a costume guy. Even when I was a kid, it just felt like something I was too old for. And then this morning, when Pam hands me this little number [holds up Popeye costume, shakes head] ...no.
Do you remember what you said to me on my first day of work, just before you walked me over to my desk?
I think that's probably all we need to hear from...
Yeah. We should be able to have that right over to you by Monday. Yeah no problem. [Reveal Jim behind Quad-Desk] Thank you.
I know. Here, Michael, you can court her as you get to know her, you know? I mean, the office is a great place for that. Pam and I, we got to know each other right out there. I mean, the first time we joked around was at my desk. And the first meal we ever had was, in the break room, actually. We were at two separate tables and, I remember that. The first time we kissed even, was right outside, and... Look, all I'm saying is that you can get to know someone really really well, like I did, right here at work.
Newsflash, the whole thing needs to go in the car.
Okay, you know what?  You don't need to be updating me as much as you're updating me.
Oh, that reminds me. [reaching into golf cart] Little something from all of us. [hand Dwight a small wrapped gift]
Really?  Do you wanna get back to that?  I could go.  I should go.
Wow, you've really embraced the whole Bond villain aesthetic.
I think it���s definitely��� Well, okay. Either way���
[looking at resume] Uh oh, this former administrative assistant misspelled 'administrative' and 'assistant.'
I'll do it. Wear a little flouncey skirt if you want, and...
No, no, no, definitely, definitely.  Yes.  Next weekend, then.  All right!  I love you, too.
Pam, Pam, it's time.  Let's go to the hospital.
Yes! That, that, that! We're definitely doing that. Are we all in agreement?
Um... are you aware that Nellie is giving out raises?
Um, everytime my sixth grade class has a field trip.
I've always gotten along well with Toby.  Uh, we're friends.  But I don't think we'll stay in touch necessarily.  I think I'll probably get updates on him from Pam.
Alright.  I'll tell everybody here that you say hi.
It's always more fun to mess with Dwight with an audience. That was usually Pam so now that she's out I had to find someone else. Turns out that Stanley is quite the comedy fan. But not everything makes him laugh. He has very specific tastes. Through a painstaking process of trial and error, I've found out what he likes. And it's really weird.
Dwight, come on. Don���t end on a bad note.
No. I never said he was on a bicycle. I just said I wasn't listening to you.
Well, then I guess you���re ready for this. [gives her the Christmas card]
[outside] So I'm still in the process of converting the garage.  It's got great light in here and I'm thinking, it could be perfect [opens garage door] for an art studio.  [Pam looks around and then looks at him] Look, I know, I bought this without asking you and it's doesn't look great, I know that.  And if you really hate it, I totally understand it's just---
I was just... I'm in love with you.
Animation? All her by the way. [points at Pam]
I'll text Pam. She's really good at this stuff.
No, I shouldn't have to ask you to do stuff like that. You should just do it.
That's just a figure of speech, you know? Blow your brains out? Come on. All it really means is that we're friends. Who else is she gonna talk to if I'm gone, right? I mean, if she left, I wouldn't blow my brains out. Of course, I would take that job in Maryland. Because it's double the pay, and soft shell crab just happens to be my favorite food.
Okay, DVDs. Five movies. What would you bring to the island? Toby, go ahead.
Hey, if there is someone out there who loves paper more than Dwight, I definitely don���t want to meet that person.
I worked in Scranton for a really long time. And uh, it's going to be weird that it's all disappearing. I mean, I always knew that the branch would shut down someday. I just figured it would be because Michael sold the building for some magic beans.
Wow. Bridges of Madison County, Legally Blond, these movies are just... .
Okay, it���s not that Pam. You know, I was thinking it reminds me of those lists Dwight used to make.
I'm just looking for my phone, so... pretend I'm not here.
Right. You're right. So maybe it was me who did it...by accident.
Then you did nothing wrong. We should go.
Hey, could you do me a favor? Could you put that in the DVD player?
It was just little thing, you know, like I could make something shake or I could make a marble fall off the counter. You know, just little things.
Uh, Wade actually has those on the road, but he���s gonna be calling in with those numbers any second. So just hold on one s--
Woah, there is a lot of brainpower in this room. We've got Michael and Oscar, the two smartest guys in the office, also in that order.
I know, but it's gonna be a little tough because there's no good place to hide there.
I am meeting Dr. J today, otherwise known as Julius Irving, famed 76er and my own personal hero. But i have to be careful not to rub it in Pam's face because let's be honest, how would I feel if I was at home stuck with the kids while she was go carting with John Stamos.
Uh, I really don't want to talk about it.
Oh!  See I'm here to learn as little information as possible.  All I really need to hear is if your incredibly successful company would be receptive to a buyout.
I think this was also the year he renounced Earth Day and vowed to the destroy the planet he once loved.
Dwight, I am really busy, I can't talk about this anymore. [Dwight follows red cord through office past Phyllis' and Stanley's desks]
So what is going on, girl in the computer?
No, I did that before, it added nothing.
Every time there's a silence, your brain's like 'Heh-heh-huh-huh' [imitating crying].
Hi. How are ya? Good to see you.
Your love line- I'm just kidding. I can't see anything.
Oh, hey, man. [Daryl walks over to Jim, angrily and stares at Jim] Oh, you know what? Before I forget again, I talked to the guys about hiring you. They're gonna bring you in for an interview.
Goodnight, have a good night. Thank you Angela.
Dwight lives on a beet farm and he practices karate at the forth grade level. And he apparently has a girlfriend, so... I guess there really is someone for everybody.
No way! All right Pam. Congratulations. [high five]
Not true. 'Cause that's not a real place.
Cons, Ryan.  He defrauded the company.  He has never made a sale.
I'll just leave that suit in your office then.
They said that they would feel more comfortable if you came along.
I bought this teapot for Pam, and I know she really wants it. So, can I trade you for it?
Nothing much.  Let me ask you something.  It's actually little awkward.
Hey, Ryan. Could you start consolidating all our Rolodex information into Outlook?
Yeah. You just sit right here. Here we go.
It's not.  It's different.  But it's a good book.
I want to clamp Michael's face in a George Foreman grill.
Wait a minute. You said the tradition is for the groom is search for her and it ends at a pub. So how about the last pub you���d ever set foot in in this town?
So the deal was, Dwight doesn't blow anything up, and I wear a costume.  And a moustache.
Uh, ok, I think we need to take him to the hospital because I'm pretty sure he has a concussion.
Sorry, how long have you been showing the house?
Your mom would love that. She would. Oh, this band is called Scrantonicity.
Psst. You think this thing's gonna go much longer?
OK, well I saw a station about a mile back so, chop chop.
Yeah. Yes. Um, I'm just in this, like, stupid fight with Karen.
[to Kevin] Why don't you just go out on a date with her? Try to spark up an on going joke and then in a month or two, if it feels right, you'll know.
I'm not understanding the confusion. Am I the only one who wants to try hufflepuffs and schnauzerhosen, and meet this glenpickle guy?
We were just kids.  What did we know?
And when was the last time Dwight and I agreed on anything ever? [clears throat]
I mean, they just need to communicate, you know?  If they said to each other what they're saying to everyone else, then--
Wow, we're having a little girl.  Oh, man.
[presses button on headset] Hello, this is Dwight.
[brings Michael into his office] So I've been meaning to tell ya, I wanna take you out for lunch. For your last day.
Do you really have to do that right now?
So maybe you're not completely ethical after all.
You know what?  Instead of a game, why don't we do an exhibition?  I'd love to see that dunk of yours.
Chapter 2 ��� Announcing guests as they enter is the height of decorum. The more volume displayed, the more honor is bestowed upon everyone present.
I was talking about my wife, and how she believes in ghosts. And then we had a little debate. Meredith said she believes in them too.
Uh, so, Cece had a little bit of a fever. And your mom also locked her in the car.
[Michael has a 'sticky-hand' toy and snags a paper off Jim's desk and then laughs] About a week ago, Michael gave his 2-week notice. And, surprisingly there is a very big difference between Michael trying and Michael not trying.
[on phone]: Man, I wish I was there to see his face when he gets to the end ...
I can always kind of win at roulette.
I have been getting ready and then driving over here.
[holds up Hunter's CD] I stole this. [Pam laughs] For you babe.
Michael Scarn takes out a nine-millimeter gun and shoots the-
You know Michael, this whole Donna thing is gonna be okay, you just... stop beating yourself up.
Ahem. This is for you... and [puts blanket around her shoulders] ...Happy Birthday, Kel.
Something cool. Like, sports marketing or... that sound something like you'd be into?
Pam, I'm really sorry. I- I'm really sorry about...all that. [Dwight smiles at Jim] Really? Smirking?
Yeah, well it's really warm in here. It's like a sleeping bag.
[driving] I am going to see Pam. Because I feel like I should. [sighs]
No, see? Right there, that���s the problem with your method. ���Cause I still don���t know if you���re saying ���Sea World��� or ���see the world,��� and it���s taking a lot of time to explain it.
Are you kidding? Thank you, man. I mean, I've wanted the opportunity to say thanks for... everything. And I'm really sorry about the job. That just seems crazy.
I don't really wanna picture it.  But thank you, Pam.
Well, I for one, was amazed at how qualified everyone was. You?
You've got to wave your arms and you've got to pound your fists. Many times. It's supposed to emphasize your point.
And for my next trick, I will make my career disappear.
I don't know what else we can do here.
We didn't, because we think it'd be better to do it together.
Listen, I was really wondering if maybe we could lock this down before lunch is over.
And what Designing Woman are you basing that on?
Oh, yeah, well don't worry about it.  We'll figure it out.  We'll be okay.
I guess he can't get any girl he wants.
I have a lot of work to do this afternoon.  Those mines aren't gonna sweep themselves.
OK. [as Dwight mixes coffee with dirt in his hand] This is crazy. You can't make a dirt ball.
I'm sorry what did you say? So wierd...
Man, I'm so sorry. When do you find out?
Why does he own a guitar if he doesn't know how to play?
Yeah, so we'll get right... You know what? I'll be right back. Stanley, you're taking over for me, buddy. I'll be right back.
Encourage him? I'm the victim, okay? He's fishing for me. We've got to do something.
So, it turns out it's the closest place to get a marriage license without a 3 day waiting period.
Gotta write that down. Ok, big day today. Airing of the documentary. Who���s excited?
Would You Rather. Would You Rather is our third game.
What the heck is going on?! The stock prices are plummeting! Are you gonna take control of the message or do I have to send in someone who understands the media?!
You'll never guess, I just got a message from my landlord apparently, my apartment flooded, something with a sprinkler. Pam, we should probably get going and see the damage.
That's actually a good idea.  We'll all take a brief intermission. [To Pam]  Hey, are you hungry?
[laughing]  Um, you know what?  I.. should have just had... I should have just had you call me on my cell.
You know, at the end of the day, it���s really only two days. I mean, I���ll be back in the office. ��If you need me for an emergency, call me. ��I���ll be there...
But! That girl must've had monstrous hands because the holes fit.
[snaps back] No one cares. Who thinks that Hillary Swank is hot, raise your hand. [half of office raises hand] Okay, and who thinks Hillary Swank is not hot, raise your hand. [other half of office raises hand]
What? Oh no no no. Dwight, no. I'm using her, for the alliance. Who knows the most information about this office? Pam.
[approaching Reception] Michael Scott, manager.  Hi, how are ya?
Correction. I do not want to sell you Professor Copperfield's Miracle Legumes.
Pam always says I look like Nixon. That's crazy, right? I mean there's nothing there. True���[touches his nose] Oh no.
Last week, I was in a drug store and I saw these glasses.  Uh, four dollars.  And it only cost me seven dollars to recreate the rest of the ensemble.  And that's a grand total of... [Jim calculates the total on his calculator-watch] eleven dollars.
I'm going home, and I'm taking my baby with me.
I got Stanley tickets to see Lewis Black for his birthday. ...Might not have been the best idea.
You know what? I'm actually going to have to call you back. Thank you. Sorry about that.
In school, we learned about this scientist who trained dogs to salivate at the sound of a bell by feeding them whenever a bell rang. For the last couple of weeks I've been conducting a similar experiment.
Well, I don't know, if Kevin's in accounting, and Toby's in Human Resources and they're talking...
I wasn't. But thank you. [to Pam] Do you know anything about this party?
Are there, uh, three w's at the beginning of the address?
Why haven't I proposed yet? Uh, actually Pam and I talked about it. And we just decided that, um -- well, we didn't want to spend first three months of our engagement apart. And Pam's always said she doesn't want a long engagement. Something in her past, I guess. I'm not really sure of the whole story, but something about a guy who used to work here...
Well, there's a $20 limit, right? So .. ?
Sure. Michael's a good teacher. A teacher is someone who stands right next to you your whole life and never lets you do anything. That's what a teacher is, right?
Well, I tried. [gestures the meeting room] You saw it, so, it's on the record. I have a plane to catch.
Hey! There she is. [Pam laughs] How you doin?
Oh my God. Pam, I don't know, I, nothing, truly, nothing. I mean, I, I just was honest with him and I, I'm so sorry, I don't know. I'll call him again. [Pam rolls her eyes and walks away]
Michael stands in the front of the boat and says that he's king of the world within the first hour, or I give you my next paycheck.
[on phone] I just want to make a point to that last caller. I disagree. I don't think it is the running game at all. I think we do have to make a few moves in this off-season.
[Dwight pushes button for floor two] Dwight, what are you doing?
Um, why did she slap Martin Luther King?
Oh, is it my turn? Ooh, I'm on the spot. I don't know. Um... you know what? I think I'm good.
Michael, I think... you did the best you could, but this is bigger than all of us.
Yeah, we had outside classes all the time and we never did anything.
[to Hank who is closing the gate] Oh wait, wait, wait! Hold on, hold on. I just need to get through. Just real quick. Real quick, open... uh, okay. [runs]
So this year, for the first time ever, I got Pam in Secret Santa. And I got her this teapot, which I know she really wants, so she can make tea at her desk. But I'm also going to stuff it with some inside jokes. Like, this is my high school yearbook photo. She saw it at the party, and it really makes her laugh. Not sure why. What else .. ooh. This is a hot sauce packet. She put this on a hot dog a couple years ago because she thought it was ketchup. And it was really funny, so I kept the other two. [holds up a miniature pencil] This would take a little too long to explain, so I won't. And this is the card. Because Christmas is the time to tell people how you feel.
Ok, I just asked that ques-, I don't know. I mean it seems like the door is huge, right? So you should be able to back the truck up to the paper.
But before he does so, I told him that he should dye his hair to go undercover.
Prank! [throws money from Dwight���s wallet on the floor]
Thank you. I've noticed we've been having a lot of conference room meetings.
Well, that's great. Congratulations. Who's the lucky lady?
Here we go. [documentary starts with the first scene of ���Pilot���]
Yeah, if Michael Scott did your home movie!
You mean today?  He stepped on a George Foremen grill and he burned his foot.
[Michael walks into the office, still a mess] Ahh, what happened to you?
[gives Dwight a thumbs-up - mouths the word] Good.
Eh, she's nice, I guess.  You know what?  Best thing to do, Pros and Cons list.
Another round, boys? Great. [Jim walks to the bar]
Nice. Music. Do you listen to it in earbuds? You don���t listen to it at all because we���re at work, not a Florence and the Machine concert, so���
[Jim and Pam hear noise] Wait, you're going up there?
Phyllis! Grab both these coffees, double-fist it, and head through this obstacle course.
Well what if we can't do it quickly.
Oh okay, she's going into labor. Make way, everybody!
Pam's doing great.  Uh, she's ten inches dilated now.  Uh, sorry, meters.  Centimeters.  And she's also fully faced.  Which I don't know what that is, uh, but no baby yet.  It's only been six, uh, nineteen hours, and uh, I just went out for some ice chips because I might have passed out a little bit, but these are very refreshing, very good.
Yes, well I want to stress test it. You know, in case anything happens.
Absolutely. We can get that out to you immediately.
