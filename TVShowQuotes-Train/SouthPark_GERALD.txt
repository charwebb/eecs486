I couldn't stay away. Curse your rockin' tits!
But it has to work! Maybe if I do a little-
A communist country run by a dictator named Fidel Castro.
Everyone in the car. We have to beat them there. 
You don't know if there's any Internet in California.
No buts! Get back to your room right now and don't come out! You got it?! 
It's your day off. You boys really wanna spend it inside in front of the TV?
No, I don't know how it is. I use a PC.
Oh, my brother took a crap once, that was enormous. It was the biggest in the history of the world, I think. 
But it's time for you to get back to school and on with your lives.
We'll wish we spent the money when we have a lawsuit on our hands.
Think about it: you weren't even trying to take the biggest crap last time. Imagine if you actually worked at it!
Yeah... Ih it's time we told the boys the truth, that they aren't really going to get to heaven. 
Oh! I'm sorry! I didn't think it was "high and mighty" to  care about the earth!
I thought we agreed what happened in the hot tub wouldn't change our relationship.
Huh? Oh, uh, no thanks, I brought my own. Microbrew sampler from Aspen. Has six different beers from local breweries.  Sahay, remember that time we built the fort in your mom's back yard?
Your teacher had a sex change?? Oh my God! 
Get out of here, you mutt! Let him go! 
The casino gave me credit! I put the house up as collateral! But I still have this ten-dollar chip.
Kyle, it's all about being a good person now! You see, Christians use hell as a way to scare people into believing what they believe. But to believe in something just because you're afraid of the consequences if you don't believe in something is no reason to believe in something. Understand?
Geez I really wish this guy would shut up.
Yes Kyle, but you still defied your parents. And you need to learn that terrorism is never the answer.
All right.  I swear I'll never understand you kids these days.
It's alright, he couldn't have gone far. Let's call the other kids' houses. 
Well Kyle, schools have lots of money. You see, we all pay taxes, and part of that tax money goes to public schools, and it's from that money that we got our 1.3 million.
Kyle, Ike says you kicked him off the TV.
And if it weren't for you people flexing your arms, America could easily get taken over by terrorists or... or China.
So then, Job got painful sores all over his body. 
What the?! ...Ike!  Ike, get back to bed right now!
Sheila, could you pass me the dead fetus?  I mean, gravy.  Ow!
We just think that you're the best person to put up a wall. We're sure you've got it in your blood.
I'd better just... take it down to the basement for now, m-make sure Kyle can't find it. 
Disgraceful! Stan and Kyle, it's up to you to show all those war-mongerers that the Founding Fathers agree with us!
Oh yeah, I got a great angle here.
That does it! I'm taking you boys OUT OF THAT SCHOOL! 
She sure does. I wouldn't mind takin' that home.
Wulluh uh I just felt like talkin' to you.
Twenty percent of American students aged six to twelve say they have tried cheesing at least once. Kids also refer to it as "the cheese game", or "vitamin cheese", or "Mary Jane piss in your face fun time". Cheesing is spreading fast.
Yeah, I guess these passes the time-share salesman gave us will come in handy.
Now you march to your room, and you think about what you've done!
No, because we don't call it fascism. Do you understand?
I-I'm sorry, but none of us can really afford to own our own vacation condo.
That Dr. Biber is about to get his ass bitten off! 
Pressure us?! You kept us all day yesterday and then had a chair lift bring us back!
How am I going to tell my family?  How do I tell them that tomorrow, we have to ...pack up our things and ...get out of the house? 
Three hundred dollars?? What in the world for??
Yeah, well, whatever, sooo let's... not... sue anyone again. Okay, come on, guys. Let's go get some ice cream!
Expert witness, did South Park Elementary allow sexual harassment to go on?
Oh my God! Come on, Sheila!  We'd better go tell the other parents what's going on!! 
Don't have any change... Don't have any change... Damn it! All right, you want change? Here.   There! There's some change. All right, a little bit.  There you go. Take the change.  Oh wait. Wait, now I don't have any change left for the bus. Hold on. Can I just get back some of that change, please?
Oh, yeah, love it! I haven't done it for a while, though. I had to go out and buy a few things, you know a-. A rod and a reel and an uh, uuh...
All right, we're gonna hit the tables. Why don't you kids run along to the comedy club? 
Yeah! But wait.  Three hundred and fifty thousand dollars. That means if we won again, it will be twelve and a quarter million! 
Sheila, let me handle this.  Having imaginary friends is fine, Kyle, but this simply will not do!
Hi Sharon. Uh, we need to talk to you about the boys.
That's it. I'm gonna make a break for it.
No, no, no, if you wanna leave South Park, fine! Tomorrow we're leaving!
Uh, you know, the people really responsible for your harassment is the public schools.  Perhaps we should sue them next.
Give me that! What we do in our bedroom is our business!
Oh no, seriously, this crap was a monster! 
Yeah. The sand thing sounds a lot simpler. 
Maybe we should... strip these jackets off, and warm our bodies next to each other!
The point is, I was wrong. Its time to legalize cats!  Heh yeah! Hooray for Gerald! Hey, let's hear it for Gerald! 
Well where else was I gonna get a napkin dispenser at nine thirty at night?
And what do we tell our kids?! We can't leave them in the dark!
You have been very very naughty!  You're a naughty girl! 
Hahah. Whatever happened to that old hunk o' junk? Haha--
So much better here with the intellectuals, isn't it, boys?  Wuhh  Mmmm.
I forgot to tell you, ah I have a gambling problem.
God said to Satan, "See? I told you. Job still praises me." 
No. It's a very fragile system that nature has designed. All things flow into each other.
What?! You don't even have a wife, Jimbo! 
No. Kyle, she's just make-believe. Like Peter Pan.
Courtney Cox, I love you.  
You're so hot  on that show.
I wish. That's the one thing I've always thought of experimenting with. A threesome.
Oh! Kyle, appealing to the Prime Minister of Canada would take... time and money we don't have.
Well, we'll find them. A-and then we'll try to put what they saw into context.
He was not really a Broflovski, he was Canadian. But we loved him all the same. 
Good-bye, Ike. You...  be a good bye, huh? You... remember all the things we taught you. 
What? Oh. Kyle, let's have a little talk. 
And then, as Job's sons and daughters were eating, God sent a mighty wind to collapse the house and crush and kill them all. 
Who the hell do you think you are?!
Just like you deceived our son into going to Kenny's; and that didn't work either!
Normally, we do it right after the baby is born, but we had to do it later for Ike because he's a--
Oh, just great! You see, Sheila?! This is what your transgender progressive thinking gets you! Now your son wants to be transracial!
Your honor, I'd like to make my closing arguments.
Well, that's what being young is all about. Once you have a family and a career, your experimenting days are over. But tonight is the exception; that's why I'm gonna smoke this cigar.  Only 'cause I've never smoked before. 
If I can make it through them, maybe I can catch the bus to Fairplay. I have to try.
Oh, I don't know. I think our boys might just have the dead fetus to win-- Heart!
Well your ad said we only had to attend a thirty-minute meeting.
Principal Victoria, was Eric Cartman called an ass-sucker? Yes or no?
Jesus! Look at us! We all don't like the Wall-Mart, but we can't stop coming here.
That son of a bitch ripped my parka! 
I hate to say it, but I think Priest Maxi was right. This is what we get for celebrating Halloween and allowing that band KoRn to come play.
Mr. Garrison, do you know the definition of sexual harassment?
No I don't want store credit, I want my son back!
Calm down, Kyle! It's okay. You're safe with Daddy. 
Uh, well, we need to find a way to close our town off from unwanted strangers!
What kind of nutjob would agree to surgically alter my son into a tall African-American?!
They were so scared, I'm sure they'll never be back!
We'll be back to pick you up after the meteor shower party, boys.
Kyle! Kyle, wake up!  We have to go! The terrorists are attacking!
A-Aspen? Uuuh, we, we can't really afford that.
That goes in the master bedroom.  Well, Kyle. What do you think of your new house?
Yeah, those dads get REALLY drunk and obnoxious.
Well, I'm sure you'll find another job soon. Something'll come along.
Eh excuse me, where, where is the bathroom for dolphins?
Yeah. It's a hybrid. I just... I just couldn't sit back and-  be a part of destroying the earth anymore.
Cruise's lawyers were very specific boys. He's sending a limo for Muhammad to meet him outside of town.
Now, you go brush your teeth and march into bed!  You won't be opening your Channukah present tonight!
Oh! Sorry Randy. Looks like you got a ticket.
Well, Kyle, that's not a reason to buy something.
It wasn't our idea to take out Santa Claus! 
No.  No, our Internet can't be broken. Ah, I've gotta get an attachment Larry sent me last night.
Now, I want you to repeat after me: 'There is no such thing as Mr. Hankey'
I'm not gonna let you change on me, Randy. Just because we shared an intimate moment in the hot tub, I won't let it change our friend-
Ike, your brother Kyle was in Squirts, and so was I. You have to go so someday you can be a big brave Jew Scout.
Nooo! I don't wanna join Apple, I like my PC!
Now, you get to sleep, and think about how your poor mother has to clean that bathroom up!
I just don't get it.  Why would he invite me fishing and then turn into a complete bastard?
Yeah, well, you know my son is just  a little bit more clever than some.
Harder for Peter?! Now you two just blow in here and say you're gonna haul him back to Canada, and we're being hard on Peter?!
Wow, so, everyone here drives a hybrid, huh?
All we know is they were seen hanging out with Craig and now they're gone.
Please come home, Kyle. 
You left home lookin' for somethin' new. 
But all you need is right here waitin' for you 
Look, you gave Ike up. You can't just change your mind.
This is the worst thing that's happened in this town!  The worst thing!
Yeah, we may not have gotten to ski earlier, but with this lift we'll get more runs in than anybody.
And so, God had a bunch of barbarians come in and slaughter Job's oxen and donkeys, and murder all his workers. 
How many times do we have to tell you this? We don't want to buy shares in a condo!
And so, in summation, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you've heard the version of my client's song recorded over twenty years ago. You've heard the exact same song produced by those cheats in the past month. I'd say it's pretty much an open-and-shut case. Make the right decision. Thank you.  We've got 'em. 
Nobody know anything. It's li-it's like the boys just vanished!
And that's why,  I've talked it over with your mother, and  ...we've decided to MOVE!
Okay, there's another one.  Aw, man! Look at that!  Can you believe this?! An SUV with a V8 engine, makes me sick!  "Ticket for driving a gas-guzzler"
Congratulations, boys! You're goin' on to the post-season. Woohoo!
Well, because they're the ones that let this harassment go on. And, they have a lot more money. I think we could get a lot more out of this than half of Stan's belongings.
Last, I'd like to bring up my expert witness: Sexual Harassment Panda.
Oh no! Y-you guys all turned gay too?? 
Hey! I worked my ass off to get to where I am today!  I wanted to be somebody!
Ah hey now Kyle, if you made a deal with somebody, you have to stick by it.
No. No, what am I thinking? I shouldn't do this.  I've been clean for ten... years. I haven't even been near a cat.  But then that report said our kids were doing it too, and... and I knew Kyle would have the same sicknesses I used to have... Now a cat is in our home, and it's too tempting.  I... I'll just do it one more time.  One. Last. Time.  Then I'll call the police; have them pick up the cat.  And then I'll never do it again.  After this one... last... time... 
Hey, come on. We should take a tour of the Smithsonian before we head back.
Oh my God! Sheila! Come look at this!
Here- here you go. And and don't go to the store down the block. The one four miles away in Fairplay has better pretzels.
Now, on to double penetration, boys. You see, sometimes when a woman has sex with more than one man, each man makes love to a different orifice.
We can't destroy it, son. We have to learn to live with it.
Hm.  You know, Eric, I've been thinking, uh...
First thing is we've gotta dispose of this!
Well, Kyle, it's always the agreeing party's responsibility to know what they are signing.
Randy, they're bringin' back Wacky Races Saturday monring!
Principal Victoria, were you aware that my client was being harassed at your school?
Huh that's right! And I also happen to be a lawyer! And I'm gonna have you sued for malpractice, and your clinic shut down!!
Uh, Token, this is very important: do you know where the boys went with the naughty tape?
Kyle, your mother and I don't want you going to the Raging Pussies concert! We gave you a chore that we thought was impossible. You weren't supposed to actually do it.
Yeah. I'm just, you know, trying to make people more aware ya' know, it's a-
Wait, here's 20. Get one for your brother, too. 
Yeah. Yeah, I think it's best we just do it right away.
Then why did your mother find this  in your dresser drawer?!
A b--uh I love dolphins, Ever since I was a child I dreamt of... Huh b-b-b- But that has hardly any bearing on what I'm hear to-
All right, time to show these people how to gamble!
Wow! It seems like you had a great time with the Super Adventure Club, Chef. They sound like really interesting people.
There! You have it! Straight from the horse's mouth!
Kyle! Kyle, can we talk to you for a minute, please?
Hello, honey, how has prison been for you?
Look, there's a Jeep over there! Go write them a ticket, Kyle!
This isn't a joke, Kyle! Bombs have already gone off in six cities!
Yes. A lot of people in town just aren't ready to drive hybrid cars.
Sshhhh! I have to win it back before Sheila finds out!
Huh, well, two girls, of course! I mean ...with another guy, you know, that'd be... 
There, there, Shei-hla. There's nothing we can do. 
Look, I'm just trying to make the people of South Park aware of a very serious problem.
What? Now why the hell would you knowingly deceive me like that?
Kidding? Well, that's not funny! That hurt my feelings!
So, Mr. Jefferson, did I hear you say you moved here from Kentucky?
You bet money on my son to win?!
Look, Kyle, adults make up those things because they're fun for children.
Look out for your brother, Kyle. You're the man now.
Oh, look, Kyle. Your little friend Stan is here to see you.
Just look at how big this house is, Kyle. Just look at it.
Yeah?! See you Saturday, makizzer shanna sharilla shaz biuznatch gazizzah!
Kyle, what on earth has gotten into you?!
Oh! So you admit that harassment goes on!
Yes. You see, I spent a lot of time going to law school, and I was able to go because I have a slightly higher intellect than others. But I still need people to pump my gas, and make my French fries, and fix my laundry machine when it breaks down.
That doctor is a miracle worker, Sheila. Iiii'm the happiest I've ever been.  Look, Ike! You're daddy's a dolphin! 
Oh, you heard him, Sheila! Kyle wants to leave! Our nice old house doesn't interest Kyle anymore! Well I'm calling the moving company right now! 
Alright, that's it! I've had about enough with iCrap, and me clouds, and a council of Geniuses, with all their future-
With my super lawyer powers, we can rid our town of cats, so that our kids can never get high again!
What? Th'um, nuh-nothing. I- I'll explain it to you when you're a little older.
Hey.  Nothing changes between us, right? I mean, we're still friends.
Kids! Are you tired of being harassed at school? Sick of being called a homo? A farty-pants? A butt-... face? Then call me, Kyle's dad, and I'll help you  close the lid on sexual harassment in schools!
But Satan said, "Oh yeah? He only praises you because you gave him so much. If you didn't give him those things, he would curse your name."
Oh come on, Mr. Jefferson, you're not one of those who think that the police go around framing rich black people just because they're jealous?
I don't think I can do it either.
Very good, Ike. That's two John Steinbeck books in one day.
Now, just let me do all the talking, Chef. We’re gonna bring these bastards down.
I have written up a bill that would make having a cat illegal in the city of South Park.
From what I understand, she's the niece of someone's coworker here in town or something.
So, does this mean I'm not really a dolphin?
Oh, those weren't mints, those were antacid tablets.
But our homes and our lives are at stake.
I wanna educate you kids with some real music.  This is The Police. Now you compare this to Tween pop and tell us which one you think is real music. 
Well that does it! I'm going to the police!
Can I have just a little change for the bus, please? I need a little... anybody have some change? Change? Got any change?  Change. Change? 
Alright Kyle!  Excuse me, where do you have special seating for dolphins?
Chef, that's Johnnie Cochran. He's the guy who knocked O. J. off.
Well, I have something to give to her!  Don't worry, Kyle. Everything's gonna be okay between me and your mom.
Ha ha ha ha ha! Ooh-ho boy, have you got a lot to learn! Sit down, son.  You see, Kyle, we humans work as a society, and in order for a society to thrive, we need gods, and clods.
Hoh, I don't know. I think maybe with all the news of famous people dying this summer, he he's just freaked himself out.
I wouldn't count on it. Come on, boys, get in the car! 
Hold on, boys. We still have to go to the hardware store, and hand out awareness citations to SUV cars in the parking lot.
Come in. You can use our Internet until you figure out what to do.
Okay, that'll be great. Let's also make sure we have enough chairs in the community center for everyone to attend.
Jimbo, your truck probably gets less than ten miles to the gallon.
Cats aren't the problem. We made cats illegal and and then I cheesed for the first time in ten years. And kids are always gonna find a new way to get high. Like sniffing glue or licking toads, or fermenting feces or huffing paint. You can also look at-
Well you bet your ass it'll come to that!
Oh yes. You've got one too, I see.
Sheila, ih-it was wrong of us to be so judgmental of Kyle. If he isn't happy with who he is, then who are we to deny hm surgery that will make him feel better about himself? 
I just want to know it meant something to you.
Hurry, you guys! The mall closes in seven hours!
Yeah.  Actually, we saw a bear a few miles back.
He's a teacher! How are we supposed to explain this to our children?!
No! Don't you see? Th-the panda's right. Boy, what a great message he has! When you sue people, you just end up causing a lot of problems for society. Uhwell, I've really learned something today. All I could see was the millions of dollars coming to me and I didn't care about where the money came from. Well, I'm no longer doing sexual harassment lawsuits in schools! They're too vague and two easily corruptible. Thank you, Sexual Harassment Panda!
Did you, or did you not, hear my client being called an ass-sucker?
I'm sorry, Stan, but unfortunately you live in a small-minded town filled with ignorant boobs.
Relax, sweetie  I know how to count cards.
And to the people of South Park.  I was wrong, and I can't let cats take the fall anymore. It's our fault. The people who use cats for their sweet urine.  We have to learn that cheesing just isn't worth it. Sure, you get to fight in the Breastriary, and swim in the Fountains of Varnov with the Itty Titty Fairies of Mammary Mountain.
So call me, Kyle's dad. Because it's not about money, it's about... wait, what am I saying? Call me! 
Guys, we have a problem!  I talked to the EFSM and they say Randy has to take the crap in Zurich.
Oh, now what's gotten into him? Stan, will you go talk to him? 
Hey Sheila. You feel like having some fun?
We can't! Don't you get it?! There's no Internet to find out why there's no Internet!
Kyle, just because Ike is adopted doesn't make him any less your brother.
Oh yeah, yeah, the kids were pretty excited.
I used to think I was crazy. But Dr, Biber told me that there are a lot of other people out there who are transspecies. All I did is change my appearance to look the way I felt...  here. And I'm telling you now that if we don't let Kyle do the same, he may never be happy. Ever! We owe him more than that, Sheila. We owe him understanding! 
Tell Ike how much fun Squirts is, Kyle.
Uh, you don't regret doing it now, do you?
Well where the hell am I supposed to go to the bathroom? I I need a large tank with salt water.
There you are, Kyle. I was gonna see if you and your brother wanted to go down to the bowling alley.
We need to be where everyone is motivated and progressive like us! Start getting your things packed, boys! The Broflovksi family is moving to San Francisco! 
You're just jealous. You're a bitter old drunk, just like your father!  Ow!! 
Uh not this again.  Ike, we are sick of you talking about ghosts!
All right, that does it! Come on, Kyle, I don't want you hanging around with these ignorant idiots! 
Everyone get your stuff; we can take my car.
But, what if you're not ready at 17?
How long have you been on the cheese?!
I really enjoyed the imagery in the last chapter of this month's book.
Well Butters, we think... that this is one of the BEST books we've ever read.
He was the most upright and honorable of men, and every day he praised God. 
Yeah! We could have the boys do their presentation as part of our peace rally on Saturday!
Oh, shove the song of the sparrow up your ass!
We have to protect our children from this, Sheila.
Thanks for releasing them to us, detective. Sorry for all the trouble they caused.
Who? Stuart? Yeah, yeah, I guess we were.
It's okay, Kyle. Just... be a good boy.
Damnit you people have to make special arrangements for transspecies people like me! I may be a dolphin, but I'm also a lawyer!
Everybody doesn't know. And why are you so ashamed of me?
It doesn't matter! Ten to eleven is Ike's time to watch MacNeil/Lehrer
That's right. So Kenny's family is happy just the way they are, and we're all a functioning part of America.
I, uh, I-I-I read about it in People.
Haven't you boys heard anything about how harmful smoking is to you and those around you?
You know your brother watches MacNeil/Lehrer Report every night at ten!
Yeah, tackle box.  Man, smell that mountain air. What a great Saturday morning; aren't weekends just the best?
We are all trying to create the future!  I'm part of the future now too. I have sat with the Council of Geniuses, performed the Toran Ra, and I've even been to me. Mr. Jobs, you have done so much for the world. You have helped connect everyone to each other.  Clearly, this is the future. But... but can't we just slow down and enjoy the present... a little longer?
They say that Bono is demanding it and that their hands are tied.
Oh God, is there nothing we can do?
Oh, you wanna leave, huh?! Okay, fine, Kyle, when we get home, we'll just pack up our things, load them in the car, and we'll leave! 
And let's make sure nobody gets a stupid hybrid, right? 
Randy, you're making me feel unimportant. Talk. Talk, damn you.
Right right, w-would, would you like red or white wine?
Get up to your room right now until your mother and I figure out how to deal with this!
Come on, honey. It says our Handicar is just pulling up.
UPS man. I have a ...package from Amazon for you.
How can there be no Internet anywhere? What's going on?!
You know, the emissions from a vehicle like yours causes irreparable damage to the ozone. I drive a hybrid; it's much better for the environment.  Thanks.
Problem is, the more you into that world, the more you need to go. Until you start blowing off all the real people who care about you. 
Steve, uh, we heard that a bunch of the kids were over here a little while ago.
Kyle, we're so sorry for the horrible sexual abuse over the years. But we're all better now.
Come on, everybody! Let's go buy wasteful gas guzzlers! 
There can't be anything in that agreement that allows a company to do what they're talking about to Kyle!
Thank you, Your Honor. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, Everyone has committed a crime here, and Everyone must pay for that crime. My client, Everyone, has been hurt by this crime and must be compensated.
We don't know. We were all passed out and... next thing we know we just woke up on a bus heading here.
Yeah! Let's all go shop at Jim's Drugs down the street! 
It is sick and disgusting, and we simply will not have it!
Oh, I think you'll see differently after hearing this. Sit down, Kyle.  Uh, okay.  You see, Job lived in the east of Jordan, a long long time ago.  Job was a great man. He was blessed with ten lovely children , a wonderful wife, and many friends. 
What haven't you tried that you've always wanted to try?
My son was kidnapped by Apple and they are holding him against his will!!
It's so wonderful to be on the same wavelength as our kids.
All right, calm down. Now, just how bad of a porno tape are we talking here? I mean, was it like Crotch Capers 3?
This is a reenactment, Kyle. My name is Pvt. John Fugasol, and I have to do what my general tells me!
Excuse me, the front door was open. Can I borrow some change? 
Listen to you. You're yelling at me; you've never yelled at me before.
Hey, you know Kobe Bryant was up in Eagle today.
And, uh Stuart, I think I owe you an apology. I realize that I shouldn't be so cold towards people that are less fortunate than me.
To find out where Apple is keeping my son!
That's right.  My son and his friends throw a party for a kid with diabetes.
Yes, it is big, isn't it? It is very big.
Whattaya mean it sounds like shit? This doesn't sound like shit.
Well, Randy, calm down. It's not a real ticket.
I don't need you wiping my ass for me. I'm a grown man.
Hup, we did. We've come to terms with it through therapy and learned to admit it.
Sorry Kyle, we gave you your allowance already.
