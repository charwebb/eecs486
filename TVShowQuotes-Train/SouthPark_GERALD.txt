Can somebody please explain to me what is going on?!
Pressure us?! You kept us all day yesterday and then had a chair lift bring us back!
So call me, Kyle's dad. Because it's not about money, it's about... wait, what am I saying? Call me! 
Look, Kyle, adults make up those things because they're fun for children.
Hello, honey, how has prison been for you?
Oh no, seriously, this crap was a monster! 
Kyle, it's all about being a good person now! You see, Christians use hell as a way to scare people into believing what they believe. But to believe in something just because you're afraid of the consequences if you don't believe in something is no reason to believe in something. Understand?
Hey! I worked my ass off to get to where I am today!  I wanted to be somebody!
Huh? What do you think? You know you like it.
Huh, well, two girls, of course! I mean ...with another guy, you know, that'd be... 
He was the most upright and honorable of men, and every day he praised God. 
Very good, Ike. That's two John Steinbeck books in one day.
God said to Satan, "See? I told you. Job still praises me." 
Uh, you know, the people really responsible for your harassment is the public schools.  Perhaps we should sue them next.
There can't be anything in that agreement that allows a company to do what they're talking about to Kyle!
Chef, that's Johnnie Cochran. He's the guy who knocked O. J. off.
And that's why,  I've talked it over with your mother, and  ...we've decided to MOVE!
He's a teacher! How are we supposed to explain this to our children?!
All right, time to show these people how to gamble!
Nooo! I don't wanna join Apple, I like my PC!
Who? Stuart? Yeah, yeah, I guess we were.
Well you bet your ass it'll come to that!
We thank God for our blessings this Chanukah. Our little family is so loving, and perfect, and nothing will ever tear us apart.  I'll get it. 
No, no, no, if you wanna leave South Park, fine! Tomorrow we're leaving!
Hey, my son is just discovering love. Maybe your daughter is, too. They-uh, they need to know about that stuff.
Oh my God! Come on, Sheila!  We'd better go tell the other parents what's going on!! 
But it has to work! Maybe if I do a little-
No, I don't know how it is. I use a PC.
Kyle! Kyle, wake up!  We have to go! The terrorists are attacking!
Yeah, those dads get REALLY drunk and obnoxious.
Yeah. I think it's great that gays are finally being so accepted. 
Hey, Mr. Withdrawn, you might not need to talk about it, but I sure do.
Well, Kyle, it's always the agreeing party's responsibility to know what they are signing.
You see, Kyle, we live in a liberal, democratic society. And Democrats make sexual harassment laws. These laws tell us what we can and can't say in the workplace. And what we can and can't do in the workplace.
Expert witness, did South Park Elementary allow sexual harassment to go on?
Oh yes. You've got one too, I see.
Well, Kyle, that's not a reason to buy something.
A b--uh I love dolphins, Ever since I was a child I dreamt of... Huh b-b-b- But that has hardly any bearing on what I'm hear to-
Sorry Kyle, we gave you your allowance already.
Now, you get to sleep, and think about how your poor mother has to clean that bathroom up!
Relax, sweetie  I know how to count cards.
A communist country run by a dictator named Fidel Castro.
Problem is, the more you into that world, the more you need to go. Until you start blowing off all the real people who care about you. 
Calm down, Kyle! It's okay. You're safe with Daddy. 
Well, that's what being young is all about. Once you have a family and a career, your experimenting days are over. But tonight is the exception; that's why I'm gonna smoke this cigar.  Only 'cause I've never smoked before. 
And let's make sure nobody gets a stupid hybrid, right? 
Oh! So you admit that harassment goes on!
If I can make it through them, maybe I can catch the bus to Fairplay. I have to try.
Your teacher had a sex change?? Oh my God! 
Don't have any change... Don't have any change... Damn it! All right, you want change? Here.   There! There's some change. All right, a little bit.  There you go. Take the change.  Oh wait. Wait, now I don't have any change left for the bus. Hold on. Can I just get back some of that change, please?
Well that does it! I'm going to the police!
Hahah. Whatever happened to that old hunk o' junk? Haha--
It doesn't matter! Ten to eleven is Ike's time to watch MacNeil/Lehrer
That does it! I'm taking you boys OUT OF THAT SCHOOL! 
I hate to say it, but I think Priest Maxi was right. This is what we get for celebrating Halloween and allowing that band KoRn to come play.
Harder for Peter?! Now you two just blow in here and say you're gonna haul him back to Canada, and we're being hard on Peter?!
Okay, there's another one.  Aw, man! Look at that!  Can you believe this?! An SUV with a V8 engine, makes me sick!  "Ticket for driving a gas-guzzler"
Kidding? Well, that's not funny! That hurt my feelings!
And so, in summation, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you've heard the version of my client's song recorded over twenty years ago. You've heard the exact same song produced by those cheats in the past month. I'd say it's pretty much an open-and-shut case. Make the right decision. Thank you.  We've got 'em. 
I just don't get it.  Why would he invite me fishing and then turn into a complete bastard?
Which cartoon is it? What cartoon'll be so insensitive as to have Mohammad as a character?
I couldn't stay away. Curse your rockin' tits!
All right, that does it! Come on, Kyle, I don't want you hanging around with these ignorant idiots! 
I forgot to tell you, ah I have a gambling problem.
You're just jealous. You're a bitter old drunk, just like your father!  Ow!! 
Cruise's lawyers were very specific boys. He's sending a limo for Muhammad to meet him outside of town.
Alright, that's it! I've had about enough with iCrap, and me clouds, and a council of Geniuses, with all their future-
Oh, now what's gotten into him? Stan, will you go talk to him? 
No! Don't you see? Th-the panda's right. Boy, what a great message he has! When you sue people, you just end up causing a lot of problems for society. Uhwell, I've really learned something today. All I could see was the millions of dollars coming to me and I didn't care about where the money came from. Well, I'm no longer doing sexual harassment lawsuits in schools! They're too vague and two easily corruptible. Thank you, Sexual Harassment Panda!
Yeah.  Actually, we saw a bear a few miles back.
Then why did your mother find this  in your dresser drawer?!
Yes Kyle, but you still defied your parents. And you need to learn that terrorism is never the answer.
Wait, here's 20. Get one for your brother, too. 
Twenty percent of American students aged six to twelve say they have tried cheesing at least once. Kids also refer to it as "the cheese game", or "vitamin cheese", or "Mary Jane piss in your face fun time". Cheesing is spreading fast.
So, Mr. Jefferson, did I hear you say you moved here from Kentucky?
You see, son, fads come and go. And this "Chin-po-ko-mon" is obviously nothing more than a fad. You don't have to be a part of it. In fact, you can make an even stronger statement by saying to your peers, "I'm not going to be a part of this fad, because I'm an individual." Do you understand?
Well, I never really wanted to experiment with anything too crazy. You know... maybe just... I don't know... masturbate in front of another guy.
Oh, look, Kyle. Your little friend Stan is here to see you.
Listen to you. You're yelling at me; you've never yelled at me before.
Oh, you heard him, Sheila! Kyle wants to leave! Our nice old house doesn't interest Kyle anymore! Well I'm calling the moving company right now! 
Uh, you don't regret doing it now, do you?
No, because we don't call it fascism. Do you understand?
Good-bye, Ike. You...  be a good bye, huh? You... remember all the things we taught you. 
No. No, what am I thinking? I shouldn't do this.  I've been clean for ten... years. I haven't even been near a cat.  But then that report said our kids were doing it too, and... and I knew Kyle would have the same sicknesses I used to have... Now a cat is in our home, and it's too tempting.  I... I'll just do it one more time.  One. Last. Time.  Then I'll call the police; have them pick up the cat.  And then I'll never do it again.  After this one... last... time... 
Hi Sharon. Uh, we need to talk to you about the boys.
Come in. You can use our Internet until you figure out what to do.
Congratulations, boys! You're goin' on to the post-season. Woohoo!
I don't need you wiping my ass for me. I'm a grown man.
We can't! Don't you get it?! There's no Internet to find out why there's no Internet!
Look, I'm just trying to make the people of South Park aware of a very serious problem.
Oh, my brother took a crap once, that was enormous. It was the biggest in the history of the world, I think. 
Well, I'm sure you'll find another job soon. Something'll come along.
Yeah! Let's all go shop at Jim's Drugs down the street! 
Oh, all right. Just don't let any of the elders know that he isn't Jewish, okay?
Guys, we have a problem!  I talked to the EFSM and they say Randy has to take the crap in Zurich.
I would like to address a personal matter: I have let myself down. And I would first like to apologize to my lovely wife.
Hey Sheila. You feel like having some fun?
Hey, you know Kobe Bryant was up in Eagle today.
Oh! Kyle, appealing to the Prime Minister of Canada would take... time and money we don't have.
Yeah, well, you know my son is just  a little bit more clever than some.
So much better here with the intellectuals, isn't it, boys?  Wuhh  Mmmm.
Tell Ike how much fun Squirts is, Kyle.
I have written up a bill that would make having a cat illegal in the city of South Park.
Wow, so, everyone here drives a hybrid, huh?
Whattaya mean it sounds like shit? This doesn't sound like shit.
He was not really a Broflovski, he was Canadian. But we loved him all the same. 
Now, I want you to repeat after me: 'There is no such thing as Mr. Hankey'
I wanna educate you kids with some real music.  This is The Police. Now you compare this to Tween pop and tell us which one you think is real music. 
I, uh, I-I-I read about it in People.
Kyle, what on earth has gotten into you?!
Uhh, Kyle, uh sometimes when people get older they need to play and pretend to keep things interesting. Iiit's just a way I can still be intimate with your mother without relying on silly sexual enhancement drugs. 
Everyone in the car. We have to beat them there. 
Well, because they're the ones that let this harassment go on. And, they have a lot more money. I think we could get a lot more out of this than half of Stan's belongings.
Mr. Garrison, do you know the definition of sexual harassment?
Huh that's right! And I also happen to be a lawyer! And I'm gonna have you sued for malpractice, and your clinic shut down!!
You know, the emissions from a vehicle like yours causes irreparable damage to the ozone. I drive a hybrid; it's much better for the environment.  Thanks.
Wow! It seems like you had a great time with the Super Adventure Club, Chef. They sound like really interesting people.
So then, Job got painful sores all over his body. 
Okay, that'll be great. Let's also make sure we have enough chairs in the community center for everyone to attend.
What kind of nutjob would agree to surgically alter my son into a tall African-American?!
Jesus! Look at us! We all don't like the Wall-Mart, but we can't stop coming here.
That's right.  My son and his friends throw a party for a kid with diabetes.
But, what if you're not ready at 17?
Oh, I think you'll see differently after hearing this. Sit down, Kyle.  Uh, okay.  You see, Job lived in the east of Jordan, a long long time ago.  Job was a great man. He was blessed with ten lovely children , a wonderful wife, and many friends. 
Give me that! What we do in our bedroom is our business!
Cats aren't the problem. We made cats illegal and and then I cheesed for the first time in ten years. And kids are always gonna find a new way to get high. Like sniffing glue or licking toads, or fermenting feces or huffing paint. You can also look at-
I used to think I was crazy. But Dr, Biber told me that there are a lot of other people out there who are transspecies. All I did is change my appearance to look the way I felt...  here. And I'm telling you now that if we don't let Kyle do the same, he may never be happy. Ever! We owe him more than that, Sheila. We owe him understanding! 
But Satan said, "Oh yeah? He only praises you because you gave him so much. If you didn't give him those things, he would curse your name."
I-I'm sorry, but none of us can really afford to own our own vacation condo.
Yeah. The sand thing sounds a lot simpler. 
Kyle, just because Ike is adopted doesn't make him any less your brother.
From what I understand, she's the niece of someone's coworker here in town or something.
It's alright, he couldn't have gone far. Let's call the other kids' houses. 
Did you, or did you not, hear my client being called an ass-sucker?
Kyle, your mother and I don't want you going to the Raging Pussies concert! We gave you a chore that we thought was impossible. You weren't supposed to actually do it.
What?! You don't even have a wife, Jimbo! 
That's it. I'm destitute.  Loan me money! You've gotta have money in the cup!  Wha- what's in the cup?
I'm sorry, Stan, but unfortunately you live in a small-minded town filled with ignorant boobs.
No. It's a very fragile system that nature has designed. All things flow into each other.
But it's time for you to get back to school and on with your lives.
Courtney Cox, I love you.  
You're so hot  on that show.
Yeah, well, whatever, sooo let's... not... sue anyone again. Okay, come on, guys. Let's go get some ice cream!
Damnit you people have to make special arrangements for transspecies people like me! I may be a dolphin, but I'm also a lawyer!
You know your brother watches MacNeil/Lehrer Report every night at ten!
Sheila, could you pass me the dead fetus?  I mean, gravy.  Ow!
Oh yes there is! You could do it again!
Oh come on, Mr. Jefferson, you're not one of those who think that the police go around framing rich black people just because they're jealous?
Hup, we did. We've come to terms with it through therapy and learned to admit it.
Yeah! We could have the boys do their presentation as part of our peace rally on Saturday!
We are all trying to create the future!  I'm part of the future now too. I have sat with the Council of Geniuses, performed the Toran Ra, and I've even been to me. Mr. Jobs, you have done so much for the world. You have helped connect everyone to each other.  Clearly, this is the future. But... but can't we just slow down and enjoy the present... a little longer?
Ugh... Alright, fine! I'll sign up with Apple.
UPS man. I have a ...package from Amazon for you.
No.  No, our Internet can't be broken. Ah, I've gotta get an attachment Larry sent me last night.
Hold on, boys. We still have to go to the hardware store, and hand out awareness citations to SUV cars in the parking lot.
Oh God, is there nothing we can do?
No. Kyle, she's just make-believe. Like Peter Pan.
With my super lawyer powers, we can rid our town of cats, so that our kids can never get high again!
Well Butters, we think... that this is one of the BEST books we've ever read.
We can't destroy it, son. We have to learn to live with it.
Oh, shove the song of the sparrow up your ass!
We need to be where everyone is motivated and progressive like us! Start getting your things packed, boys! The Broflovksi family is moving to San Francisco! 
Yeah! But wait.  Three hundred and fifty thousand dollars. That means if we won again, it will be twelve and a quarter million! 
Well where else was I gonna get a napkin dispenser at nine thirty at night?
My son was kidnapped by Apple and they are holding him against his will!!
They were so scared, I'm sure they'll never be back!
Oh! Sorry Randy. Looks like you got a ticket.
Yes. A lot of people in town just aren't ready to drive hybrid cars.
This isn't a joke, Kyle! Bombs have already gone off in six cities!
Oh yeah, I got a great angle here.
Randy, they're bringin' back Wacky Races Saturday monring!
Kyle, you'd better stop being anti-Semitic right now, mister!!
They say that Bono is demanding it and that their hands are tied.
Alright Kyle!  Excuse me, where do you have special seating for dolphins?
You have been very very naughty!  You're a naughty girl! 
That doctor is a miracle worker, Sheila. Iiii'm the happiest I've ever been.  Look, Ike! You're daddy's a dolphin! 
Well your ad said we only had to attend a thirty-minute meeting.
Now, on to double penetration, boys. You see, sometimes when a woman has sex with more than one man, each man makes love to a different orifice.
And what do we tell our kids?! We can't leave them in the dark!
Kyle, we're so sorry for the horrible sexual abuse over the years. But we're all better now.
The point is, I was wrong. Its time to legalize cats!  Heh yeah! Hooray for Gerald! Hey, let's hear it for Gerald! 
Please come home, Kyle. 
You left home lookin' for somethin' new. 
But all you need is right here waitin' for you 
And, uh Stuart, I think I owe you an apology. I realize that I shouldn't be so cold towards people that are less fortunate than me.
Well, Randy, calm down. It's not a real ticket.
I'm a big boy. I took a big boy poop.
Oh, really?! Well, don't you worry, Kyle. We can cover that black eye up with some cream base, and the coat and pants we'll bleach with an acid wash for a fun vintage look.
Oh, I don't know. I think our boys might just have the dead fetus to win-- Heart!
It's okay, Kyle. Just... be a good boy.
Huh? Oh, uh, no thanks, I brought my own. Microbrew sampler from Aspen. Has six different beers from local breweries.  Sahay, remember that time we built the fort in your mom's back yard?
Maybe you can make a difference, Stan.  Maybe you can get everyone to drive hybrid cars. Until that day,  we're just gonna have to be  with our own kind. 
Look, you gave Ike up. You can't just change your mind.
Yeah... Ih it's time we told the boys the truth, that they aren't really going to get to heaven. 
Uh not this again.  Ike, we are sick of you talking about ghosts!
I wouldn't count on it. Come on, boys, get in the car! 
What? Th'um, nuh-nothing. I- I'll explain it to you when you're a little older.
Hello?  I I'm sorry, I just really need some change for the bus?
That goes in the master bedroom.  Well, Kyle. What do you think of your new house?
All right, we're gonna hit the tables. Why don't you kids run along to the comedy club? 
I thought we agreed what happened in the hot tub wouldn't change our relationship.
Oh, just great! You see, Sheila?! This is what your transgender progressive thinking gets you! Now your son wants to be transracial!
This is the worst thing that's happened in this town!  The worst thing!
Disgraceful! Stan and Kyle, it's up to you to show all those war-mongerers that the Founding Fathers agree with us!
Steve, uh, we heard that a bunch of the kids were over here a little while ago.
Get out of here, you mutt! Let him go! 
Now, just let me do all the talking, Chef. We’re gonna bring these bastards down.
You see boys, Jew Scouts is a special group that borrows a little bit from all different Jewish denominations. From the Orthodox Jews, from the Hasidic Jews, from the Northern Italy Cave Jews... But you have to believe the basic tenets of Judaism to be a Scout.
What haven't you tried that you've always wanted to try?
That's it. I'm gonna make a break for it.
Hey.  Nothing changes between us, right? I mean, we're still friends.
That son of a bitch ripped my parka! 
It's so wonderful to be on the same wavelength as our kids.
Everyone get your stuff; we can take my car.
Eh excuse me, where, where is the bathroom for dolphins?
That's right. So Kenny's family is happy just the way they are, and we're all a functioning part of America.
Yeah, we may not have gotten to ski earlier, but with this lift we'll get more runs in than anybody.
Sshhhh! I have to win it back before Sheila finds out!
Now, you go brush your teeth and march into bed!  You won't be opening your Channukah present tonight!
Yeah?! See you Saturday, makizzer shanna sharilla shaz biuznatch gazizzah!
Look, there's a Jeep over there! Go write them a ticket, Kyle!
Right right, w-would, would you like red or white wine?
And then, as Job's sons and daughters were eating, God sent a mighty wind to collapse the house and crush and kill them all. 
Three hundred dollars?? What in the world for??
That Dr. Biber is about to get his ass bitten off! 
To find out where Apple is keeping my son!
Ha ha ha ha ha! Ooh-ho boy, have you got a lot to learn! Sit down, son.  You see, Kyle, we humans work as a society, and in order for a society to thrive, we need gods, and clods.
Well, because Kenny's family doesn't have as much money as we do.
You don't know if there's any Internet in California.
We just think that you're the best person to put up a wall. We're sure you've got it in your blood.
Ah hey now Kyle, if you made a deal with somebody, you have to stick by it.
We don't know. We were all passed out and... next thing we know we just woke up on a bus heading here.
Hey, come on. We should take a tour of the Smithsonian before we head back.
Maybe we should... strip these jackets off, and warm our bodies next to each other!
Haven't you boys heard anything about how harmful smoking is to you and those around you?
Oh my God! Sheila! Come look at this!
Yeah. Yeah, I think it's best we just do it right away.
Come on, honey. It says our Handicar is just pulling up.
I'd better just... take it down to the basement for now, m-make sure Kyle can't find it. 
A-Aspen? Uuuh, we, we can't really afford that.
Oh, yeah, love it! I haven't done it for a while, though. I had to go out and buy a few things, you know a-. A rod and a reel and an uh, uuh...
Yes, it is big, isn't it? It is very big.
Yeah. That guy probably thinks he can get us to go away by being so goofy! 
I-it is the single most vile, twisted, dark piece of porn ever made. 
Look out for your brother, Kyle. You're the man now.
Hm.  You know, Eric, I've been thinking, uh...
Sheila, let me handle this.  Having imaginary friends is fine, Kyle, but this simply will not do!
How many times do we have to tell you this? We don't want to buy shares in a condo!
No buts! Get back to your room right now and don't come out! You got it?! 
You bet money on my son to win?!
Randy, you're making me feel unimportant. Talk. Talk, damn you.
It is sick and disgusting, and we simply will not have it!
Jimbo, your truck probably gets less than ten miles to the gallon.
Get up to your room right now until your mother and I figure out how to deal with this!
Last, I'd like to bring up my expert witness: Sexual Harassment Panda.
I wish. That's the one thing I've always thought of experimenting with. A threesome.
But our homes and our lives are at stake.
Hoh, I don't know. I think maybe with all the news of famous people dying this summer, he he's just freaked himself out.
Kyle! Kyle, can we talk to you for a minute, please?
Normally, we do it right after the baby is born, but we had to do it later for Ike because he's a--
Yeah, I guess these passes the time-share salesman gave us will come in handy.
Who the hell do you think you are?!
It wasn't our idea to take out Santa Claus! 
It's your day off. You boys really wanna spend it inside in front of the TV?
Oh no! Y-you guys all turned gay too?? 
Kyle, perhaps we handled this wrong, buh- but you need to understand that we don't want-
There you are, Kyle. I was gonna see if you and your brother wanted to go down to the bowling alley.
Stan, a class-action lawsuit means the end of this town. We can't possibly go up against their lawyers!
Can I have just a little change for the bus, please? I need a little... anybody have some change? Change? Got any change?  Change. Change? 
Uh, well, we need to find a way to close our town off from unwanted strangers!
As you can see, Your Honor, my client is too upset to continue.
And to the people of South Park.  I was wrong, and I can't let cats take the fall anymore. It's our fault. The people who use cats for their sweet urine.  We have to learn that cheesing just isn't worth it. Sure, you get to fight in the Breastriary, and swim in the Fountains of Varnov with the Itty Titty Fairies of Mammary Mountain.
Oh, those weren't mints, those were antacid tablets.
Nobody know anything. It's li-it's like the boys just vanished!
Yeah. I'm just, you know, trying to make people more aware ya' know, it's a-
Kyle, Ike says you kicked him off the TV.
There! You have it! Straight from the horse's mouth!
Yeah, tackle box.  Man, smell that mountain air. What a great Saturday morning; aren't weekends just the best?
How can there be no Internet anywhere? What's going on?!
I just want to know it meant something to you.
Just look at how big this house is, Kyle. Just look at it.
This is a reenactment, Kyle. My name is Pvt. John Fugasol, and I have to do what my general tells me!
I don't think I can do it either.
Wulluh uh I just felt like talkin' to you.
Yes. You see, I spent a lot of time going to law school, and I was able to go because I have a slightly higher intellect than others. But I still need people to pump my gas, and make my French fries, and fix my laundry machine when it breaks down.
There, there, Shei-hla. There's nothing we can do. 
We'll wish we spent the money when we have a lawsuit on our hands.
Oh! I'm sorry! I didn't think it was "high and mighty" to  care about the earth!
Think about it: you weren't even trying to take the biggest crap last time. Imagine if you actually worked at it!
Ike, your brother Kyle was in Squirts, and so was I. You have to go so someday you can be a big brave Jew Scout.
All we know is they were seen hanging out with Craig and now they're gone.
Geez I really wish this guy would shut up.
How am I going to tell my family?  How do I tell them that tomorrow, we have to ...pack up our things and ...get out of the house? 
No I don't want store credit, I want my son back!
Sheila, ih-it was wrong of us to be so judgmental of Kyle. If he isn't happy with who he is, then who are we to deny hm surgery that will make him feel better about himself? 
Just like you deceived our son into going to Kenny's; and that didn't work either!
Aaah, can we cross the line to take our kids to school?
You're so right about this place. It's wonderful.
And so, God had a bunch of barbarians come in and slaughter Job's oxen and donkeys, and murder all his workers. 
Come on, everybody! Let's go buy wasteful gas guzzlers! 
Well, I really don't see how  that has anything to do with the-
What? Now why the hell would you knowingly deceive me like that?
Oh yeah, yeah, the kids were pretty excited.
What the?! ...Ike!  Ike, get back to bed right now!
