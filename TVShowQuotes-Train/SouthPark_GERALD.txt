I'm not gonna let you change on me, Randy. Just because we shared an intimate moment in the hot tub, I won't let it change our friend-

How was it, honey?

It wasn't your life yesterday. 

I couldn't stay away. Curse your rockin' tits!

Here- here you go. And and don't go to the store down the block. The one four miles away in Fairplay has better pretzels.

Yeah, lie.

Now, just let me do all the talking, Chef. We’re gonna bring these bastards down.

Think about it: you weren't even trying to take the biggest crap last time. Imagine if you actually worked at it!

Kyle! Kyle, wake up!  We have to go! The terrorists are attacking!

Hey Sheila. You feel like having some fun?

How did this happen?

I don't know. Come on, Kyle! You're gonna be late for Jew Scouts!

Wait, here's 20. Get one for your brother, too. 

Well, Randy, calm down. It's not a real ticket.

What?  Get out of here, kid!

I agree.

Apologize to him!

Are you guys parked over here?

Well your ad said we only had to attend a thirty-minute meeting.

What? Oh. Kyle, let's have a little talk. 

You know, the emissions from a vehicle like yours causes irreparable damage to the ozone. I drive a hybrid; it's much better for the environment.  Thanks.

Oh no! Y-you guys all turned gay too?? 

I'm a big boy. I took a big boy poop.

Hm... Good point; here's $10. 

Whattaya mean it sounds like shit? This doesn't sound like shit.

Boy, that was great, wasn't it?!

That brave, brave man.

Kyle, what are you doing in there?

All right, we're gonna hit the tables. Why don't you kids run along to the comedy club? 

Stephen!  Stephen, you have to keep moving!

Hey, my son is just discovering love. Maybe your daughter is, too. They-uh, they need to know about that stuff.

And what do we tell our kids?! We can't leave them in the dark!

I love you.

Kyle...

Yeah. I'm just, you know, trying to make people more aware ya' know, it's a-

Oh my God! Come on, Sheila!  We'd better go tell the other parents what's going on!! 

Kyle! You look terrible! 

Why?! 

Oh, I think you'll see differently after hearing this. Sit down, Kyle.  Uh, okay.  You see, Job lived in the east of Jordan, a long long time ago.  Job was a great man. He was blessed with ten lovely children , a wonderful wife, and many friends. 

We need to be where everyone is motivated and progressive like us! Start getting your things packed, boys! The Broflovksi family is moving to San Francisco! 

Ow! You son of a bitch! 

Yes, it certainly is.

Oh. Uhhh, I don't know.

Everything okay in here, Kyle?

They, they're... they're playing street hockey!

Very good, Ike. That's two John Steinbeck books in one day.

Kyle, your mother and I don't want you going to the Raging Pussies concert! We gave you a chore that we thought was impossible. You weren't supposed to actually do it.

To find out where Apple is keeping my son!

Hello, honey, how has prison been for you?

From what I understand, she's the niece of someone's coworker here in town or something.

Oh, those weren't mints, those were antacid tablets.

Yeah, I guess so.

God help them all.

Uh, Token, this is very important: do you know where the boys went with the naughty tape?

Everybody doesn't know. And why are you so ashamed of me?

Huuuh!

As you can see, Your Honor, my client is too upset to continue.

That son of a bitch ripped my parka! 

How many times do we have to tell you this? We don't want to buy shares in a condo!

They were so scared, I'm sure they'll never be back!

Thanks.

The point is, I was wrong. Its time to legalize cats!  Heh yeah! Hooray for Gerald! Hey, let's hear it for Gerald! 

Oh, that's disgusting!!! Now, now stop this!!

I would like to address a personal matter: I have let myself down. And I would first like to apologize to my lovely wife.

You haven't?

Which cartoon is it? What cartoon'll be so insensitive as to have Mohammad as a character?

A-Aspen? Uuuh, we, we can't really afford that.

I wanna educate you kids with some real music.  This is The Police. Now you compare this to Tween pop and tell us which one you think is real music. 

Oh, really?! Well, don't you worry, Kyle. We can cover that black eye up with some cream base, and the coat and pants we'll bleach with an acid wash for a fun vintage look.

Hold on, boys. We still have to go to the hardware store, and hand out awareness citations to SUV cars in the parking lot.

All right.  I swear I'll never understand you kids these days.

Look, I'm just trying to make the people of South Park aware of a very serious problem.

Sheila, could you pass me the dead fetus?  I mean, gravy.  Ow!

That's what our boys were talking about?

You see, son, fads come and go. And this "Chin-po-ko-mon" is obviously nothing more than a fad. You don't have to be a part of it. In fact, you can make an even stronger statement by saying to your peers, "I'm not going to be a part of this fad, because I'm an individual." Do you understand?

Courtney Cox, I love you.  
You're so hot  on that show.

Wow.

There can't be anything in that agreement that allows a company to do what they're talking about to Kyle!

Wulluh uh I just felt like talkin' to you.

A b--uh I love dolphins, Ever since I was a child I dreamt of... Huh b-b-b- But that has hardly any bearing on what I'm hear to-

You don't know?! You're the principal!

Oh, is the game on or something? 

Courtney Cox,

Congratulations, boys! You're goin' on to the post-season. Woohoo!

You're so right about this place. It's wonderful.

Can somebody please explain to me what is going on?!

Well Kyle?

No, because we don't call it fascism. Do you understand?

It could be nationwide.

I thought we agreed what happened in the hot tub wouldn't change our relationship.

All we know is they were seen hanging out with Craig and now they're gone.

Well, I totally agree, Kyle.

Yeah. The sand thing sounds a lot simpler. 

Twenty percent of American students aged six to twelve say they have tried cheesing at least once. Kids also refer to it as "the cheese game", or "vitamin cheese", or "Mary Jane piss in your face fun time". Cheesing is spreading fast.

Yes. You see, I spent a lot of time going to law school, and I was able to go because I have a slightly higher intellect than others. But I still need people to pump my gas, and make my French fries, and fix my laundry machine when it breaks down.

Well, I'm sure you'll find another job soon. Something'll come along.

I forgot to tell you, ah I have a gambling problem.

Hey, Randy, what's up?

Randy, where will you go?

Having a good time?

Sorry Kyle, we gave you your allowance already.

Uh not this again.  Ike, we are sick of you talking about ghosts!

We've gotta get out of here!

That's what we're here for.

An agreement to do what?!

Oh, look, Kyle. Your little friend Stan is here to see you.

How long have you been on the cheese?!

And you did nothing.

Hey.  Nothing changes between us, right? I mean, we're still friends.

But, what if you're not ready at 17?

Principal Victoria, was Eric Cartman called an ass-sucker? Yes or no?

Dammit..!

But it has to work! Maybe if I do a little-

Give me that! What we do in our bedroom is our business!

Can I come with you?

I'm sorry, Stan, but unfortunately you live in a small-minded town filled with ignorant boobs.

Hey! W-what are you saying? What "types"?

Cha-a-ange?

One question?

Oh, now what's gotten into him? Stan, will you go talk to him? 

Randy, they're bringin' back Wacky Races Saturday monring!

Look, there's a Jeep over there! Go write them a ticket, Kyle!

Steve, uh, we heard that a bunch of the kids were over here a little while ago.

Principal Victoria, were you aware that my client was being harassed at your school?

Last, I'd like to bring up my expert witness: Sexual Harassment Panda.

Oh, my brother took a crap once, that was enormous. It was the biggest in the history of the world, I think. 

Geez I really wish this guy would shut up.

Who the hell do you think you are?!

Hey there. Alan, right?

Sorry I'm late.

Oh my God! 

Kyle? What are you doing here?

Oh we're so sorry, Jared

Hey. Talk to me.

Kyle, what did you do?!

What did you say?!

Okay, boys. Do you have any questions? 

If I can make it through them, maybe I can catch the bus to Fairplay. I have to try.

Killing our kids? 

It wasn't our idea to take out Santa Claus! 

He was the most upright and honorable of men, and every day he praised God. 

NO, no, uh I don't think so.

Well? What do you think, huh? 

Eh excuse me, where, where is the bathroom for dolphins?

Oh, shove the song of the sparrow up your ass!

He’s using the Chewbacca defense.

All right, calm down. Now, just how bad of a porno tape are we talking here? I mean, was it like Crotch Capers 3?

Yes, that's mine.

Come on, everybody! Let's go buy wasteful gas guzzlers! 

No.  No, our Internet can't be broken. Ah, I've gotta get an attachment Larry sent me last night.

Oh! Sorry Randy. Looks like you got a ticket.

Mm-hmm.

And... the rest of the country?

Hey, boys, how's the research coming?

Yeah! Let's all go shop at Jim's Drugs down the street! 

He's a teacher! How are we supposed to explain this to our children?!

There was no war months ago!

Hahah. Whatever happened to that old hunk o' junk? Haha--

Mr. Garrison, do you know the definition of sexual harassment?

Stephen, what are you doing?

Maybe we should... strip these jackets off, and warm our bodies next to each other!

Yeah.

Now, I want you to repeat after me: 'There is no such thing as Mr. Hankey'

You're just jealous. You're a bitter old drunk, just like your father!  Ow!! 

Stan, a class-action lawsuit means the end of this town. We can't possibly go up against their lawyers!

Oh no! Ohh!

How am I going to tell my family?  How do I tell them that tomorrow, we have to ...pack up our things and ...get out of the house? 

There, there, Shei-hla. There's nothing we can do. 

Well Kyle, schools have lots of money. You see, we all pay taxes, and part of that tax money goes to public schools, and it's from that money that we got our 1.3 million.

There you are, Kyle. I was gonna see if you and your brother wanted to go down to the bowling alley.

We'll be back to pick you up after the meteor shower party, boys.

That's it. I'm gonna make a break for it.

What can we do, Randy?

Look, Ike is our son now!

And to the people of South Park.  I was wrong, and I can't let cats take the fall anymore. It's our fault. The people who use cats for their sweet urine.  We have to learn that cheesing just isn't worth it. Sure, you get to fight in the Breastriary, and swim in the Fountains of Varnov with the Itty Titty Fairies of Mammary Mountain.

Thank you, Your Honor. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, Everyone has committed a crime here, and Everyone must pay for that crime. My client, Everyone, has been hurt by this crime and must be compensated.

Sheila, ih-it was wrong of us to be so judgmental of Kyle. If he isn't happy with who he is, then who are we to deny hm surgery that will make him feel better about himself? 

Wow, neat!

Come on, honey. It says our Handicar is just pulling up.

Now, you get to sleep, and think about how your poor mother has to clean that bathroom up!

Oh, yeah, love it! I haven't done it for a while, though. I had to go out and buy a few things, you know a-. A rod and a reel and an uh, uuh...

...He might, Kyle.

Huh? What do you think? You know you like it.

Who? Stuart? Yeah, yeah, I guess we were.

Good idea.

It was Backdoor Sluts 9.

I have written up a bill that would make having a cat illegal in the city of South Park.

Get him in the ribs! 

Well, they were probably real.

No Internet... anywhere...

Huh? Oh, uh, no thanks, I brought my own. Microbrew sampler from Aspen. Has six different beers from local breweries.  Sahay, remember that time we built the fort in your mom's back yard?

I just want to know it meant something to you.

We said we'd never tell anybody?

Well, I really don't see how  that has anything to do with the-

How much was bail this time? 

Oh, that does it!

Okay! Finally! How do we do that?

Then why did your mother find this  in your dresser drawer?!

Hey! I worked my ass off to get to where I am today!  I wanted to be somebody!

Yeah, those dads get REALLY drunk and obnoxious.

I'd better just... take it down to the basement for now, m-make sure Kyle can't find it. 

Yeah. That guy probably thinks he can get us to go away by being so goofy! 

Randy, what is this?

Mrs. Garrison, grab Kyle!

More schnapps! 

A Handicar? What's that?

It is sick and disgusting, and we simply will not have it!

All right, that does it! Come on, Kyle, I don't want you hanging around with these ignorant idiots! 

What the hell's goin' on out here?! 

Make me a... dolphin? 

Well, uh uh a few people, yeah.

Good-bye, Ike. You...  be a good bye, huh? You... remember all the things we taught you. 

Oh, hello, son. 

Courtney Cox,

Oh yeah, I got a great angle here.

I wouldn't count on it. Come on, boys, get in the car! 

Hey, it's a bear! 

It sure did.

Well where the hell am I supposed to go to the bathroom? I I need a large tank with salt water.

Yeah, we may not have gotten to ski earlier, but with this lift we'll get more runs in than anybody.

You know your brother watches MacNeil/Lehrer Report every night at ten!

Kyle, perhaps we handled this wrong, buh- but you need to understand that we don't want-

Oh, right.

Yeah. Come along, Kyle 

Oh, uuhh. I don't know. 

That's not ridicul-

Oh God, is there nothing we can do?

The casino gave me credit! I put the house up as collateral! But I still have this ten-dollar chip.

Are you doing okay?

Cats aren't the problem. We made cats illegal and and then I cheesed for the first time in ten years. And kids are always gonna find a new way to get high. Like sniffing glue or licking toads, or fermenting feces or huffing paint. You can also look at-

How about I put on the uniform?

Ha ha ha ha ha! Ooh-ho boy, have you got a lot to learn! Sit down, son.  You see, Kyle, we humans work as a society, and in order for a society to thrive, we need gods, and clods.

Oh! Hi, Kyle. 

Wow, so, everyone here drives a hybrid, huh?

What, What did you say?

Oh my God! Sheila! Come look at this!

I don't think I can do it either.

Ow!

I'm going with you.

It's your day off. You boys really wanna spend it inside in front of the TV?

I don't need you wiping my ass for me. I'm a grown man.

I really enjoyed the imagery in the last chapter of this month's book.

Hoh, I don't know. I think maybe with all the news of famous people dying this summer, he he's just freaked himself out.

Where am I?

Hi Sharon. Uh, we need to talk to you about the boys.

I love you.

You're dreaming!

It's alright, he couldn't have gone far. Let's call the other kids' houses. 

Wow...

Aha. 

Pan-Panda's mouth.

This isn't a joke, Kyle! Bombs have already gone off in six cities!

I-I'm sorry, but none of us can really afford to own our own vacation condo.

Yeah. That's right.

Ohh, not so good.

We thank God for our blessings this Chanukah. Our little family is so loving, and perfect, and nothing will ever tear us apart.  I'll get it. 

Just look at how big this house is, Kyle. Just look at it.

Alright, that's it! I've had about enough with iCrap, and me clouds, and a council of Geniuses, with all their future-

You can't do this alone!

Sure is. 

Being smug is a good thing. 

Well, that's what being young is all about. Once you have a family and a career, your experimenting days are over. But tonight is the exception; that's why I'm gonna smoke this cigar.  Only 'cause I've never smoked before. 

Cruise's lawyers were very specific boys. He's sending a limo for Muhammad to meet him outside of town.

The police work for time-share, too? 

Here they come! 

Yeah. It's a hybrid. I just... I just couldn't sit back and-  be a part of destroying the earth anymore.

From Ireland.

Yeah.

So then, Job got painful sores all over his body. 

Oh, I don't know. I think our boys might just have the dead fetus to win-- Heart!

Okay, I'm done.

Oh, you wanna leave, huh?! Okay, fine, Kyle, when we get home, we'll just pack up our things, load them in the car, and we'll leave! 

Oh, all right. Just don't let any of the elders know that he isn't Jewish, okay?

Hey everybody. Good to see you again. 

Yeah, well, whatever, sooo let's... not... sue anyone again. Okay, come on, guys. Let's go get some ice cream!

Yeah, I know what you mean.

How can there be no Internet anywhere? What's going on?!

I am, Your Honor. Gerald Broflovski.

My God, can you believe those people?!

You bet money on my son to win?!

You're so hot

Yeah. I think it's great that gays are finally being so accepted. 

Haven't you boys heard anything about how harmful smoking is to you and those around you?

Nobody know anything. It's li-it's like the boys just vanished!

Sshhhh! I have to win it back before Sheila finds out!

Yes?

Well, we'll find them. A-and then we'll try to put what they saw into context.

Thuh that's right. It's just harmless experimenting.

Well, because they're the ones that let this harassment go on. And, they have a lot more money. I think we could get a lot more out of this than half of Stan's belongings.

It's... other-worldly.

Hup, we did. We've come to terms with it through therapy and learned to admit it.

This is the worst thing that's happened in this town!  The worst thing!

We don't know. We were all passed out and... next thing we know we just woke up on a bus heading here.

You're so hot

Yeah.  Actually, we saw a bear a few miles back.

No I don't want store credit, I want my son back!

Oh come on, Mr. Jefferson, you're not one of those who think that the police go around framing rich black people just because they're jealous?

So it DOES go on!!!

Mm-hmm. 

Incriminate.

Yeah. Now THIS, is a house. 

She's mine, you little asshole!

Meaning we're going to circumcise him. 

We'ge gotta get our boys back! 

Kids! Are you tired of being harassed at school? Sick of being called a homo? A farty-pants? A butt-... face? Then call me, Kyle's dad, and I'll help you  close the lid on sexual harassment in schools!

You're so hot

He can't do that!

So we're friends again?

It's so wonderful to be on the same wavelength as our kids.

I doubt it. 

Lucky.

I wish. That's the one thing I've always thought of experimenting with. A threesome.

Harder for Peter?! Now you two just blow in here and say you're gonna haul him back to Canada, and we're being hard on Peter?!

Uh, you don't regret doing it now, do you?

What? Th'um, nuh-nothing. I- I'll explain it to you when you're a little older.

Eh, neither did we.

I love you.

You are?

So, Mr. Jefferson, did I hear you say you moved here from Kentucky?

That does it! I'm taking you boys OUT OF THAT SCHOOL! 

I just don't get it.  Why would he invite me fishing and then turn into a complete bastard?

And, uh Stuart, I think I owe you an apology. I realize that I shouldn't be so cold towards people that are less fortunate than me.

Hey there, Richard!

And who's to blame?

Hm.  You know, Eric, I've been thinking, uh...

Kyle, Ike says you kicked him off the TV.

Aaah, can we cross the line to take our kids to school?

Kyle!

You have been very very naughty!  You're a naughty girl! 

But it's time for you to get back to school and on with your lives.

Yeah, tackle box.  Man, smell that mountain air. What a great Saturday morning; aren't weekends just the best?

Why?

Yes.

Oh God. Oh Jesus.

Oh, just great! You see, Sheila?! This is what your transgender progressive thinking gets you! Now your son wants to be transracial!

Me neither.

That's what being young is all about.

Yeah, I guess these passes the time-share salesman gave us will come in handy.

Kids!

Kyle, that's not the issue right now.

Wow! It seems like you had a great time with the Super Adventure Club, Chef. They sound like really interesting people.

What haven't you tried that you've always wanted to try?

Expert witness, did South Park Elementary allow sexual harassment to go on?

I hate to say it, but I think Priest Maxi was right. This is what we get for celebrating Halloween and allowing that band KoRn to come play.

No! Don't you see? Th-the panda's right. Boy, what a great message he has! When you sue people, you just end up causing a lot of problems for society. Uhwell, I've really learned something today. All I could see was the millions of dollars coming to me and I didn't care about where the money came from. Well, I'm no longer doing sexual harassment lawsuits in schools! They're too vague and two easily corruptible. Thank you, Sexual Harassment Panda!

So call me, Kyle's dad. Because it's not about money, it's about... wait, what am I saying? Call me! 

We're rooting for the Broncos here, Jakov!

All right! We did it, Eric!

All right, time to show these people how to gamble!

Jesus...

No, I don't know how it is. I use a PC.

Well, because Kenny's family doesn't have as much money as we do.

Change?  Hello? Do you have any change?

That Dr. Biber is about to get his ass bitten off! 

on that show.

I don't have any urges!

Hey, you know Kobe Bryant was up in Eagle today.

Please come home, Kyle. 
You left home lookin' for somethin' new. 
But all you need is right here waitin' for you 

Well? What do you think, Kyle?

Ike, your brother Kyle was in Squirts, and so was I. You have to go so someday you can be a big brave Jew Scout.

Kyle, it's all about being a good person now! You see, Christians use hell as a way to scare people into believing what they believe. But to believe in something just because you're afraid of the consequences if you don't believe in something is no reason to believe in something. Understand?

Yeah. See ya. 

Well, I never really wanted to experiment with anything too crazy. You know... maybe just... I don't know... masturbate in front of another guy.

We can't destroy it, son. We have to learn to live with it.

Thanks for releasing them to us, detective. Sorry for all the trouble they caused.

No. It's a very fragile system that nature has designed. All things flow into each other.

Oh Jesus...  I feel warm too!

What?

Good-bye!

With my super lawyer powers, we can rid our town of cats, so that our kids can never get high again!

Yeah. I'm down twenty-six thousand.

Your honor, I'd like to make my closing arguments.

We just think that you're the best person to put up a wall. We're sure you've got it in your blood.

Oho...  Thanks. 

Huh? 

Oh yes there is! You could do it again!

Well, Kyle, that's not a reason to buy something.

Uhhh... Mind your... mother, smart-ass.

Wow, filet mignon' and lobster!

Ahh. Ahhhahhahahahh.

Alright Kyle!  Excuse me, where do you have special seating for dolphins?

Yes. A lot of people in town just aren't ready to drive hybrid cars.

NOW, KYLE! 

Hey Randy.

Oh, you heard him, Sheila! Kyle wants to leave! Our nice old house doesn't interest Kyle anymore! Well I'm calling the moving company right now! 

Yeah. We sure are.

Backdoor Sluts 9?!?

No, no, no, if you wanna leave South Park, fine! Tomorrow we're leaving!

Finally, we get to go skiing!

Kyle, what on earth has gotten into you?!

There's nothing I can do.

...What?

Probably not.

Uh, what are they doing?

Hey, what the heck is going on?

What's going on down here?

What?

All right, we did it!

Oh my God!

And so, God had a bunch of barbarians come in and slaughter Job's oxen and donkeys, and murder all his workers. 

Oh, God, what have I done?

Dear God, it's been over thirteen hours!

Normally, we do it right after the baby is born, but we had to do it later for Ike because he's a--

What's "grab ass?"

Problem is, the more you into that world, the more you need to go. Until you start blowing off all the real people who care about you. 

It's okay... it's dead.

If you'll just...  sign right here. 

Look out for your brother, Kyle. You're the man now.

I- huh? 

What?!

Well what the heck does this w-! 

Wow, I'm good!

What the?! ...Ike!  Ike, get back to bed right now!

Hey, Mr. Withdrawn, you might not need to talk about it, but I sure do.

Your teacher had a sex change?? Oh my God! 

Well, this one is bigger!

God said to Satan, "See? I told you. Job still praises me." 

Oh no, seriously, this crap was a monster! 

Jesus! Look at us! We all don't like the Wall-Mart, but we can't stop coming here.

You're having regrets, aren't you?

Again!

What is it, Kyle?

Chef, that's Johnnie Cochran. He's the guy who knocked O. J. off.

Kyle, where's your mother?

You're too young for this stuff!

Yeah! But wait.  Three hundred and fifty thousand dollars. That means if we won again, it will be twelve and a quarter million! 

Can I have just a little change for the bus, please? I need a little... anybody have some change? Change? Got any change?  Change. Change? 

But Satan said, "Oh yeah? He only praises you because you gave him so much. If you didn't give him those things, he would curse your name."

Well that does it! I'm going to the police!

So full of metaphor.

Oh! Kyle, appealing to the Prime Minister of Canada would take... time and money we don't have.

Look, you gave Ike up. You can't just change your mind.

Oh, uh I didn't realize that. 

I, uh, I-I-I read about it in People.

...No.  No, no, it's crazy.

Mm-hmm.

Honey?

It's okay, Kyle. Just... be a good boy.

Right right, w-would, would you like red or white wine?

What th- Look, they're- They're dolphins! Why?

Hello, Kyle. How's the hemorrhoid today?

What?! You don't even have a wife, Jimbo! 

Yeah... Ih it's time we told the boys the truth, that they aren't really going to get to heaven. 

Come on, Kyle, we should get going!

We have to protect our children from this, Sheila.

Huh... how come?

on that show.

Hello?  I I'm sorry, I just really need some change for the bus?

Randy! We've looked everywhere! Kyle's missing too!

And let's make sure nobody gets a stupid hybrid, right? 

It doesn't matter! Ten to eleven is Ike's time to watch MacNeil/Lehrer

Get up to your room right now until your mother and I figure out how to deal with this!

The flagpole! That's great! 

Kyle, have you been getting high?!

on that show.

No. Does it really matter?

...Oh, sorry.

Yeah! We could have the boys do their presentation as part of our peace rally on Saturday!

Oh! So you admit that harassment goes on!

Yeah, well, you know my son is just  a little bit more clever than some.

Like it.

Well Butters, we think... that this is one of the BEST books we've ever read.

A communist country run by a dictator named Fidel Castro.

Uh huh.

on that show.

I I'm not sure.

Punching trees?

Just like you deceived our son into going to Kenny's; and that didn't work either!

Uh-oh.

That doctor is a miracle worker, Sheila. Iiii'm the happiest I've ever been.  Look, Ike! You're daddy's a dolphin! 

Now, you go brush your teeth and march into bed!  You won't be opening your Channukah present tonight!

HAAAAAA!!!  Kyle! What's happened to you??

Jimbo, your truck probably gets less than ten miles to the gallon.

Yeah, dirty lungs!

Ow! 

Here I come! 

Maybe you can make a difference, Stan.  Maybe you can get everyone to drive hybrid cars. Until that day,  we're just gonna have to be  with our own kind. 

Yeah. Can we go now, please?

Muff cabbage?

Well where else was I gonna get a napkin dispenser at nine thirty at night?

So, does this mean I'm not really a dolphin?

Oh yes. You've got one too, I see.

What?!

Let it ride!!

This is a reenactment, Kyle. My name is Pvt. John Fugasol, and I have to do what my general tells me!

Okay, that'll be great. Let's also make sure we have enough chairs in the community center for everyone to attend.

Don't answer that!

Yyeeaahh!!!!

Because we're your parents!

You see boys, Jew Scouts is a special group that borrows a little bit from all different Jewish denominations. From the Orthodox Jews, from the Hasidic Jews, from the Northern Italy Cave Jews... But you have to believe the basic tenets of Judaism to be a Scout.

Take it easy. We'll find him.

Hey now, let him go! 

I'm sorry, honey.

Listen to you. You're yelling at me; you've never yelled at me before.

Yeah. Yeah, I think it's best we just do it right away.

And that's why,  I've talked it over with your mother, and  ...we've decided to MOVE!

He was not really a Broflovski, he was Canadian. But we loved him all the same. 

Stop the game! 

Randy, you're making me feel unimportant. Talk. Talk, damn you.

Look, Kyle, adults make up those things because they're fun for children.

How did you do it, Kyle?

Guys, we have a problem!  I talked to the EFSM and they say Randy has to take the crap in Zurich.

So uh. Well. That was certainly... interesting.

What? You do?

Oh, Jesus. 

...Sorry, I don't think I get your-

What? Now why the hell would you knowingly deceive me like that?

Now, on to double penetration, boys. You see, sometimes when a woman has sex with more than one man, each man makes love to a different orifice.

Yes, it is big, isn't it? It is very big.

You don't know if there's any Internet in California.

Hey, Randy. What are you doing? 

I-it is the single most vile, twisted, dark piece of porn ever made. 

Stinger?

Courtney Cox,

Oh! I'm sorry! I didn't think it was "high and mighty" to  care about the earth!

They say that Bono is demanding it and that their hands are tied.

The answer is no, Kyle.

What the hell are they doing now?!

Courtney Cox,

Doing what?

Three hundred dollars?? What in the world for??

Did you, or did you not, hear my client being called an ass-sucker?

Courtney Cox,

Now, now-I, I wasn't lucky.

Right. Right-right.

And then, as Job's sons and daughters were eating, God sent a mighty wind to collapse the house and crush and kill them all. 

Get out of the way, Peterson! 

Disgraceful! Stan and Kyle, it's up to you to show all those war-mongerers that the Founding Fathers agree with us!

We are all trying to create the future!  I'm part of the future now too. I have sat with the Council of Geniuses, performed the Toran Ra, and I've even been to me. Mr. Jobs, you have done so much for the world. You have helped connect everyone to each other.  Clearly, this is the future. But... but can't we just slow down and enjoy the present... a little longer?

But our homes and our lives are at stake.

First thing is we've gotta dispose of this!

He was just here! Ike!

Nooo! I don't wanna join Apple, I like my PC!

That's it. I'm destitute.  Loan me money! You've gotta have money in the cup!  Wha- what's in the cup?

Yes Kyle, but you still defied your parents. And you need to learn that terrorism is never the answer.

She sure does. I wouldn't mind takin' that home.

Yes that's right. We're the Broflovskis.

What kind of nutjob would agree to surgically alter my son into a tall African-American?!

My son was kidnapped by Apple and they are holding him against his will!!

Hello, boys. 

Say it!

What's that?

Yeah, I'm a big boy.

That goes in the master bedroom.  Well, Kyle. What do you think of your new house?

Huh, well, two girls, of course! I mean ...with another guy, you know, that'd be... 

Yes?

What? Why??

Yeah?! See you Saturday, makizzer shanna sharilla shaz biuznatch gazizzah!

I used to think I was crazy. But Dr, Biber told me that there are a lot of other people out there who are transspecies. All I did is change my appearance to look the way I felt...  here. And I'm telling you now that if we don't let Kyle do the same, he may never be happy. Ever! We owe him more than that, Sheila. We owe him understanding! 

Huh?

You do??

Stop it! I really do need change!

No buts! Get back to your room right now and don't come out! You got it?! 

Yes, I can tell.

Come in. You can use our Internet until you figure out what to do.

Yeah?  Do you like your package, ma'am? 

Yeah, it's really amazing.

And if it weren't for you people flexing your arms, America could easily get taken over by terrorists or... or China.

Kyle, just because Ike is adopted doesn't make him any less your brother.

Well, screw you guys! 

Kyle, we're so sorry for the horrible sexual abuse over the years. But we're all better now.

No. No, what am I thinking? I shouldn't do this.  I've been clean for ten... years. I haven't even been near a cat.  But then that report said our kids were doing it too, and... and I knew Kyle would have the same sicknesses I used to have... Now a cat is in our home, and it's too tempting.  I... I'll just do it one more time.  One. Last. Time.  Then I'll call the police; have them pick up the cat.  And then I'll never do it again.  After this one... last... time... 

Uh, well, we need to find a way to close our town off from unwanted strangers!

Open this door!

You see, Kyle, we live in a liberal, democratic society. And Democrats make sexual harassment laws. These laws tell us what we can and can't say in the workplace. And what we can and can't do in the workplace.
