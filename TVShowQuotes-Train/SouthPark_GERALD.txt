And what do we tell our kids?! We can't leave them in the dark!
Calm down, Kyle! It's okay. You're safe with Daddy. 
Yeah... Ih it's time we told the boys the truth, that they aren't really going to get to heaven. 
Problem is, the more you into that world, the more you need to go. Until you start blowing off all the real people who care about you. 
But it's time for you to get back to school and on with your lives.
Yeah. The sand thing sounds a lot simpler. 
Nooo! I don't wanna join Apple, I like my PC!
Well your ad said we only had to attend a thirty-minute meeting.
Sshhhh! I have to win it back before Sheila finds out!
Look, Kyle, adults make up those things because they're fun for children.
Kyle, you'd better stop being anti-Semitic right now, mister!!
Relax, sweetie  I know how to count cards.
Hey Sheila. You feel like having some fun?
All right, time to show these people how to gamble!
As you can see, Your Honor, my client is too upset to continue.
No, no, no, if you wanna leave South Park, fine! Tomorrow we're leaving!
No, I don't know how it is. I use a PC.
So much better here with the intellectuals, isn't it, boys?  Wuhh  Mmmm.
And that's why,  I've talked it over with your mother, and  ...we've decided to MOVE!
Well, I never really wanted to experiment with anything too crazy. You know... maybe just... I don't know... masturbate in front of another guy.
Cats aren't the problem. We made cats illegal and and then I cheesed for the first time in ten years. And kids are always gonna find a new way to get high. Like sniffing glue or licking toads, or fermenting feces or huffing paint. You can also look at-
Everyone get your stuff; we can take my car.
Look, there's a Jeep over there! Go write them a ticket, Kyle!
Hup, we did. We've come to terms with it through therapy and learned to admit it.
There! You have it! Straight from the horse's mouth!
Who the hell do you think you are?!
Oh, you heard him, Sheila! Kyle wants to leave! Our nice old house doesn't interest Kyle anymore! Well I'm calling the moving company right now! 
Listen to you. You're yelling at me; you've never yelled at me before.
I really enjoyed the imagery in the last chapter of this month's book.
A b--uh I love dolphins, Ever since I was a child I dreamt of... Huh b-b-b- But that has hardly any bearing on what I'm hear to-
Then why did your mother find this  in your dresser drawer?!
And, uh Stuart, I think I owe you an apology. I realize that I shouldn't be so cold towards people that are less fortunate than me.
All right, we're gonna hit the tables. Why don't you kids run along to the comedy club? 
Now, you go brush your teeth and march into bed!  You won't be opening your Channukah present tonight!
Uh, Token, this is very important: do you know where the boys went with the naughty tape?
Don't have any change... Don't have any change... Damn it! All right, you want change? Here.   There! There's some change. All right, a little bit.  There you go. Take the change.  Oh wait. Wait, now I don't have any change left for the bus. Hold on. Can I just get back some of that change, please?
So, does this mean I'm not really a dolphin?
Oh! I'm sorry! I didn't think it was "high and mighty" to  care about the earth!
Everyone in the car. We have to beat them there. 
We don't know. We were all passed out and... next thing we know we just woke up on a bus heading here.
Mr. Garrison, do you know the definition of sexual harassment?
UPS man. I have a ...package from Amazon for you.
Now, you get to sleep, and think about how your poor mother has to clean that bathroom up!
There, there, Shei-hla. There's nothing we can do. 
Yeah, well, you know my son is just  a little bit more clever than some.
You have been very very naughty!  You're a naughty girl! 
You see boys, Jew Scouts is a special group that borrows a little bit from all different Jewish denominations. From the Orthodox Jews, from the Hasidic Jews, from the Northern Italy Cave Jews... But you have to believe the basic tenets of Judaism to be a Scout.
No! Don't you see? Th-the panda's right. Boy, what a great message he has! When you sue people, you just end up causing a lot of problems for society. Uhwell, I've really learned something today. All I could see was the millions of dollars coming to me and I didn't care about where the money came from. Well, I'm no longer doing sexual harassment lawsuits in schools! They're too vague and two easily corruptible. Thank you, Sexual Harassment Panda!
Kyle! Kyle, wake up!  We have to go! The terrorists are attacking!
Oh no, seriously, this crap was a monster! 
If I can make it through them, maybe I can catch the bus to Fairplay. I have to try.
Oh, I think you'll see differently after hearing this. Sit down, Kyle.  Uh, okay.  You see, Job lived in the east of Jordan, a long long time ago.  Job was a great man. He was blessed with ten lovely children , a wonderful wife, and many friends. 
Please come home, Kyle. 
You left home lookin' for somethin' new. 
But all you need is right here waitin' for you 
I would like to address a personal matter: I have let myself down. And I would first like to apologize to my lovely wife.
How many times do we have to tell you this? We don't want to buy shares in a condo!
I thought we agreed what happened in the hot tub wouldn't change our relationship.
Uh, you know, the people really responsible for your harassment is the public schools.  Perhaps we should sue them next.
Well Kyle, schools have lots of money. You see, we all pay taxes, and part of that tax money goes to public schools, and it's from that money that we got our 1.3 million.
Yeah.  Actually, we saw a bear a few miles back.
Hello, honey, how has prison been for you?
Kyle, your mother and I don't want you going to the Raging Pussies concert! We gave you a chore that we thought was impossible. You weren't supposed to actually do it.
I-it is the single most vile, twisted, dark piece of porn ever made. 
You're just jealous. You're a bitter old drunk, just like your father!  Ow!! 
No. Kyle, she's just make-believe. Like Peter Pan.
What? Now why the hell would you knowingly deceive me like that?
Hahah. Whatever happened to that old hunk o' junk? Haha--
Courtney Cox, I love you.  
You're so hot  on that show.
Three hundred dollars?? What in the world for??
You're so right about this place. It's wonderful.
Maybe you can make a difference, Stan.  Maybe you can get everyone to drive hybrid cars. Until that day,  we're just gonna have to be  with our own kind. 
Oh, my brother took a crap once, that was enormous. It was the biggest in the history of the world, I think. 
Kidding? Well, that's not funny! That hurt my feelings!
Yeah! We could have the boys do their presentation as part of our peace rally on Saturday!
But, what if you're not ready at 17?
Principal Victoria, was Eric Cartman called an ass-sucker? Yes or no?
How am I going to tell my family?  How do I tell them that tomorrow, we have to ...pack up our things and ...get out of the house? 
Thanks for releasing them to us, detective. Sorry for all the trouble they caused.
Well, Kyle, that's not a reason to buy something.
We'll wish we spent the money when we have a lawsuit on our hands.
Well where the hell am I supposed to go to the bathroom? I I need a large tank with salt water.
It doesn't matter! Ten to eleven is Ike's time to watch MacNeil/Lehrer
Very good, Ike. That's two John Steinbeck books in one day.
I couldn't stay away. Curse your rockin' tits!
Yeah. That guy probably thinks he can get us to go away by being so goofy! 
Come on, honey. It says our Handicar is just pulling up.
But our homes and our lives are at stake.
Well, I have something to give to her!  Don't worry, Kyle. Everything's gonna be okay between me and your mom.
Steve, uh, we heard that a bunch of the kids were over here a little while ago.
I'm not gonna let you change on me, Randy. Just because we shared an intimate moment in the hot tub, I won't let it change our friend-
We can't destroy it, son. We have to learn to live with it.
Yeah! Let's all go shop at Jim's Drugs down the street! 
Look out for your brother, Kyle. You're the man now.
Well, I'm sure you'll find another job soon. Something'll come along.
Well, we'll find them. A-and then we'll try to put what they saw into context.
Yeah. I think it's great that gays are finally being so accepted. 
Kyle, we're so sorry for the horrible sexual abuse over the years. But we're all better now.
Now, I want you to repeat after me: 'There is no such thing as Mr. Hankey'
It's okay, Kyle. Just... be a good boy.
They say that Bono is demanding it and that their hands are tied.
No.  No, our Internet can't be broken. Ah, I've gotta get an attachment Larry sent me last night.
Geez I really wish this guy would shut up.
He's a teacher! How are we supposed to explain this to our children?!
The point is, I was wrong. Its time to legalize cats!  Heh yeah! Hooray for Gerald! Hey, let's hear it for Gerald! 
Oh yeah, I got a great angle here.
Uh, you don't regret doing it now, do you?
Oh, yeah, love it! I haven't done it for a while, though. I had to go out and buy a few things, you know a-. A rod and a reel and an uh, uuh...
Huh that's right! And I also happen to be a lawyer! And I'm gonna have you sued for malpractice, and your clinic shut down!!
Well, because Kenny's family doesn't have as much money as we do.
Principal Victoria, were you aware that my client was being harassed at your school?
Huh? Oh, uh, no thanks, I brought my own. Microbrew sampler from Aspen. Has six different beers from local breweries.  Sahay, remember that time we built the fort in your mom's back yard?
Get up to your room right now until your mother and I figure out how to deal with this!
Damnit you people have to make special arrangements for transspecies people like me! I may be a dolphin, but I'm also a lawyer!
Yeah, we may not have gotten to ski earlier, but with this lift we'll get more runs in than anybody.
Alright, that's it! I've had about enough with iCrap, and me clouds, and a council of Geniuses, with all their future-
Everybody doesn't know. And why are you so ashamed of me?
We just think that you're the best person to put up a wall. We're sure you've got it in your blood.
It's your day off. You boys really wanna spend it inside in front of the TV?
He was the most upright and honorable of men, and every day he praised God. 
That's it. I'm destitute.  Loan me money! You've gotta have money in the cup!  Wha- what's in the cup?
Kyle, Ike says you kicked him off the TV.
Excuse me, the front door was open. Can I borrow some change? 
Kids! Are you tired of being harassed at school? Sick of being called a homo? A farty-pants? A butt-... face? Then call me, Kyle's dad, and I'll help you  close the lid on sexual harassment in schools!
Come in. You can use our Internet until you figure out what to do.
And then you fight the Boob Goblin in the Gazongas Cave, and then the girl may thank you for it. But she. Isn't. Real.
I'd better just... take it down to the basement for now, m-make sure Kyle can't find it. 
Oh no! Y-you guys all turned gay too?? 
Now you march to your room, and you think about what you've done!
Oh, shove the song of the sparrow up your ass!
Huh, well, two girls, of course! I mean ...with another guy, you know, that'd be... 
You see, son, fads come and go. And this "Chin-po-ko-mon" is obviously nothing more than a fad. You don't have to be a part of it. In fact, you can make an even stronger statement by saying to your peers, "I'm not going to be a part of this fad, because I'm an individual." Do you understand?
Oh, you wanna leave, huh?! Okay, fine, Kyle, when we get home, we'll just pack up our things, load them in the car, and we'll leave! 
I don't need you wiping my ass for me. I'm a grown man.
Oh, I don't know. I think our boys might just have the dead fetus to win-- Heart!
What?! You don't even have a wife, Jimbo! 
We'll be back to pick you up after the meteor shower party, boys.
Here- here you go. And and don't go to the store down the block. The one four miles away in Fairplay has better pretzels.
Ah hey now Kyle, if you made a deal with somebody, you have to stick by it.
Chef, that's Johnnie Cochran. He's the guy who knocked O. J. off.
And if it weren't for you people flexing your arms, America could easily get taken over by terrorists or... or China.
Look, you gave Ike up. You can't just change your mind.
Kyle! Kyle, can we talk to you for a minute, please?
Yeah! But wait.  Three hundred and fifty thousand dollars. That means if we won again, it will be twelve and a quarter million! 
That son of a bitch ripped my parka! 
Yeah?! See you Saturday, makizzer shanna sharilla shaz biuznatch gazizzah!
Kyle, perhaps we handled this wrong, buh- but you need to understand that we don't want-
Right right, w-would, would you like red or white wine?
Uh, well, we need to find a way to close our town off from unwanted strangers!
Tell Ike how much fun Squirts is, Kyle.
Can I have just a little change for the bus, please? I need a little... anybody have some change? Change? Got any change?  Change. Change? 
Sheila, let me handle this.  Having imaginary friends is fine, Kyle, but this simply will not do!
That does it! I'm taking you boys OUT OF THAT SCHOOL! 
That's it. I'm gonna make a break for it.
Get out of here, you mutt! Let him go! 
And let's make sure nobody gets a stupid hybrid, right? 
No. No, what am I thinking? I shouldn't do this.  I've been clean for ten... years. I haven't even been near a cat.  But then that report said our kids were doing it too, and... and I knew Kyle would have the same sicknesses I used to have... Now a cat is in our home, and it's too tempting.  I... I'll just do it one more time.  One. Last. Time.  Then I'll call the police; have them pick up the cat.  And then I'll never do it again.  After this one... last... time... 
It wasn't our idea to take out Santa Claus! 
Maybe we should... strip these jackets off, and warm our bodies next to each other!
It's so wonderful to be on the same wavelength as our kids.
We have to protect our children from this, Sheila.
Well, I really don't see how  that has anything to do with the-
Well, because they're the ones that let this harassment go on. And, they have a lot more money. I think we could get a lot more out of this than half of Stan's belongings.
First thing is we've gotta dispose of this!
Cruise's lawyers were very specific boys. He's sending a limo for Muhammad to meet him outside of town.
Yeah, tackle box.  Man, smell that mountain air. What a great Saturday morning; aren't weekends just the best?
I just want to know it meant something to you.
Good-bye, Ike. You...  be a good bye, huh? You... remember all the things we taught you. 
That goes in the master bedroom.  Well, Kyle. What do you think of your new house?
Hey, come on. We should take a tour of the Smithsonian before we head back.
Hold on, boys. We still have to go to the hardware store, and hand out awareness citations to SUV cars in the parking lot.
Yeah, those dads get REALLY drunk and obnoxious.
I'm sorry, Stan, but unfortunately you live in a small-minded town filled with ignorant boobs.
All right, calm down. Now, just how bad of a porno tape are we talking here? I mean, was it like Crotch Capers 3?
I wouldn't count on it. Come on, boys, get in the car! 
You see, Kyle, we live in a liberal, democratic society. And Democrats make sexual harassment laws. These laws tell us what we can and can't say in the workplace. And what we can and can't do in the workplace.
Hurry, you guys! The mall closes in seven hours!
Randy, you're making me feel unimportant. Talk. Talk, damn you.
Uhh, Kyle, uh sometimes when people get older they need to play and pretend to keep things interesting. Iiit's just a way I can still be intimate with your mother without relying on silly sexual enhancement drugs. 
Kyle, what on earth has gotten into you?!
Normally, we do it right after the baby is born, but we had to do it later for Ike because he's a--
But it has to work! Maybe if I do a little-
Sheila, could you pass me the dead fetus?  I mean, gravy.  Ow!
He was not really a Broflovski, he was Canadian. But we loved him all the same. 
You don't know if there's any Internet in California.
How can there be no Internet anywhere? What's going on?!
Just look at how big this house is, Kyle. Just look at it.
And to the people of South Park.  I was wrong, and I can't let cats take the fall anymore. It's our fault. The people who use cats for their sweet urine.  We have to learn that cheesing just isn't worth it. Sure, you get to fight in the Breastriary, and swim in the Fountains of Varnov with the Itty Titty Fairies of Mammary Mountain.
I hate to say it, but I think Priest Maxi was right. This is what we get for celebrating Halloween and allowing that band KoRn to come play.
A communist country run by a dictator named Fidel Castro.
That's right. So Kenny's family is happy just the way they are, and we're all a functioning part of America.
With my super lawyer powers, we can rid our town of cats, so that our kids can never get high again!
I just don't get it.  Why would he invite me fishing and then turn into a complete bastard?
Guys, we have a problem!  I talked to the EFSM and they say Randy has to take the crap in Zurich.
Oh come on, Mr. Jefferson, you're not one of those who think that the police go around framing rich black people just because they're jealous?
Whattaya mean it sounds like shit? This doesn't sound like shit.
No I don't want store credit, I want my son back!
Yeah, well, whatever, sooo let's... not... sue anyone again. Okay, come on, guys. Let's go get some ice cream!
Harder for Peter?! Now you two just blow in here and say you're gonna haul him back to Canada, and we're being hard on Peter?!
Can somebody please explain to me what is going on?!
Oh, just great! You see, Sheila?! This is what your transgender progressive thinking gets you! Now your son wants to be transracial!
But Satan said, "Oh yeah? He only praises you because you gave him so much. If you didn't give him those things, he would curse your name."
I wish. That's the one thing I've always thought of experimenting with. A threesome.
Well that does it! I'm going to the police!
That's right.  My son and his friends throw a party for a kid with diabetes.
Oh! So you admit that harassment goes on!
Hoh, I don't know. I think maybe with all the news of famous people dying this summer, he he's just freaked himself out.
And so, in summation, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you've heard the version of my client's song recorded over twenty years ago. You've heard the exact same song produced by those cheats in the past month. I'd say it's pretty much an open-and-shut case. Make the right decision. Thank you.  We've got 'em. 
Hey! I worked my ass off to get to where I am today!  I wanted to be somebody!
Well you bet your ass it'll come to that!
Give me that! What we do in our bedroom is our business!
Yes Kyle, but you still defied your parents. And you need to learn that terrorism is never the answer.
Last, I'd like to bring up my expert witness: Sexual Harassment Panda.
Yes. A lot of people in town just aren't ready to drive hybrid cars.
Oh yes. You've got one too, I see.
Well Butters, we think... that this is one of the BEST books we've ever read.
Yeah. It's a hybrid. I just... I just couldn't sit back and-  be a part of destroying the earth anymore.
Sorry Kyle, we gave you your allowance already.
Hey, Mr. Withdrawn, you might not need to talk about it, but I sure do.
Oh my God! Come on, Sheila!  We'd better go tell the other parents what's going on!! 
I used to think I was crazy. But Dr, Biber told me that there are a lot of other people out there who are transspecies. All I did is change my appearance to look the way I felt...  here. And I'm telling you now that if we don't let Kyle do the same, he may never be happy. Ever! We owe him more than that, Sheila. We owe him understanding! 
Yeah. Yeah, I think it's best we just do it right away.
Yeah. I'm just, you know, trying to make people more aware ya' know, it's a-
No buts! Get back to your room right now and don't come out! You got it?! 
Huh? What do you think? You know you like it.
Oh, look, Kyle. Your little friend Stan is here to see you.
It's alright, he couldn't have gone far. Let's call the other kids' houses. 
Yes. You see, I spent a lot of time going to law school, and I was able to go because I have a slightly higher intellect than others. But I still need people to pump my gas, and make my French fries, and fix my laundry machine when it breaks down.
I'm a big boy. I took a big boy poop.
Which cartoon is it? What cartoon'll be so insensitive as to have Mohammad as a character?
Stan, a class-action lawsuit means the end of this town. We can't possibly go up against their lawyers!
Oh, really?! Well, don't you worry, Kyle. We can cover that black eye up with some cream base, and the coat and pants we'll bleach with an acid wash for a fun vintage look.
What? Oh. Kyle, let's have a little talk. 
Thank you, Your Honor. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, Everyone has committed a crime here, and Everyone must pay for that crime. My client, Everyone, has been hurt by this crime and must be compensated.
The casino gave me credit! I put the house up as collateral! But I still have this ten-dollar chip.
Hey.  Nothing changes between us, right? I mean, we're still friends.
We need to be where everyone is motivated and progressive like us! Start getting your things packed, boys! The Broflovksi family is moving to San Francisco! 
Look, I'm just trying to make the people of South Park aware of a very serious problem.
Disgraceful! Stan and Kyle, it's up to you to show all those war-mongerers that the Founding Fathers agree with us!
We can't! Don't you get it?! There's no Internet to find out why there's no Internet!
Alright Kyle!  Excuse me, where do you have special seating for dolphins?
Okay, that'll be great. Let's also make sure we have enough chairs in the community center for everyone to attend.
Your honor, I'd like to make my closing arguments.
Jimbo, your truck probably gets less than ten miles to the gallon.
So call me, Kyle's dad. Because it's not about money, it's about... wait, what am I saying? Call me! 
Just like you deceived our son into going to Kenny's; and that didn't work either!
From what I understand, she's the niece of someone's coworker here in town or something.
Wait, here's 20. Get one for your brother, too. 
God said to Satan, "See? I told you. Job still praises me." 
You know your brother watches MacNeil/Lehrer Report every night at ten!
Ike, your brother Kyle was in Squirts, and so was I. You have to go so someday you can be a big brave Jew Scout.
Pressure us?! You kept us all day yesterday and then had a chair lift bring us back!
I don't know. Come on, Kyle! You're gonna be late for Jew Scouts!
All we know is they were seen hanging out with Craig and now they're gone.
Oh, those weren't mints, those were antacid tablets.
I don't think I can do it either.
Well, Randy, calm down. It's not a real ticket.
This isn't a joke, Kyle! Bombs have already gone off in six cities!
I have written up a bill that would make having a cat illegal in the city of South Park.
So, Mr. Jefferson, did I hear you say you moved here from Kentucky?
Hi Sharon. Uh, we need to talk to you about the boys.
Did you, or did you not, hear my client being called an ass-sucker?
We thank God for our blessings this Chanukah. Our little family is so loving, and perfect, and nothing will ever tear us apart.  I'll get it. 
And so, God had a bunch of barbarians come in and slaughter Job's oxen and donkeys, and murder all his workers. 
We are all trying to create the future!  I'm part of the future now too. I have sat with the Council of Geniuses, performed the Toran Ra, and I've even been to me. Mr. Jobs, you have done so much for the world. You have helped connect everyone to each other.  Clearly, this is the future. But... but can't we just slow down and enjoy the present... a little longer?
No, because we don't call it fascism. Do you understand?
I, uh, I-I-I read about it in People.
Come on, everybody! Let's go buy wasteful gas guzzlers! 
Expert witness, did South Park Elementary allow sexual harassment to go on?
All right, that does it! Come on, Kyle, I don't want you hanging around with these ignorant idiots! 
Congratulations, boys! You're goin' on to the post-season. Woohoo!
Oh yeah, yeah, the kids were pretty excited.
Well, Kyle, it's always the agreeing party's responsibility to know what they are signing.
What haven't you tried that you've always wanted to try?
Wulluh uh I just felt like talkin' to you.
Oh yes there is! You could do it again!
What kind of nutjob would agree to surgically alter my son into a tall African-American?!
Sheila, ih-it was wrong of us to be so judgmental of Kyle. If he isn't happy with who he is, then who are we to deny hm surgery that will make him feel better about himself? 
Oh, all right. Just don't let any of the elders know that he isn't Jewish, okay?
That doctor is a miracle worker, Sheila. Iiii'm the happiest I've ever been.  Look, Ike! You're daddy's a dolphin! 
Oh! Sorry Randy. Looks like you got a ticket.
Kyle, it's all about being a good person now! You see, Christians use hell as a way to scare people into believing what they believe. But to believe in something just because you're afraid of the consequences if you don't believe in something is no reason to believe in something. Understand?
Oh my God! Sheila! Come look at this!
Hm.  You know, Eric, I've been thinking, uh...
Who? Stuart? Yeah, yeah, I guess we were.
Yes, it is big, isn't it? It is very big.
No. It's a very fragile system that nature has designed. All things flow into each other.
Hey, you know Kobe Bryant was up in Eagle today.
Nobody know anything. It's li-it's like the boys just vanished!
Yeah, I guess these passes the time-share salesman gave us will come in handy.
Think about it: you weren't even trying to take the biggest crap last time. Imagine if you actually worked at it!
That Dr. Biber is about to get his ass bitten off! 
Wow! It seems like you had a great time with the Super Adventure Club, Chef. They sound like really interesting people.
Well, that's what being young is all about. Once you have a family and a career, your experimenting days are over. But tonight is the exception; that's why I'm gonna smoke this cigar.  Only 'cause I've never smoked before. 
There can't be anything in that agreement that allows a company to do what they're talking about to Kyle!
I-I'm sorry, but none of us can really afford to own our own vacation condo.
Your teacher had a sex change?? Oh my God! 
You bet money on my son to win?!
Twenty percent of American students aged six to twelve say they have tried cheesing at least once. Kids also refer to it as "the cheese game", or "vitamin cheese", or "Mary Jane piss in your face fun time". Cheesing is spreading fast.
My son was kidnapped by Apple and they are holding him against his will!!
This is a reenactment, Kyle. My name is Pvt. John Fugasol, and I have to do what my general tells me!
Well where else was I gonna get a napkin dispenser at nine thirty at night?
It is sick and disgusting, and we simply will not have it!
