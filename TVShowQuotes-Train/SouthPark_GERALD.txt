We can't! Don't you get it?! There's no Internet to find out why there's no Internet!
We are all trying to create the future!  I'm part of the future now too. I have sat with the Council of Geniuses, performed the Toran Ra, and I've even been to me. Mr. Jobs, you have done so much for the world. You have helped connect everyone to each other.  Clearly, this is the future. But... but can't we just slow down and enjoy the present... a little longer?
The point is, I was wrong. Its time to legalize cats!  Heh yeah! Hooray for Gerald! Hey, let's hear it for Gerald! 
Just like you deceived our son into going to Kenny's; and that didn't work either!
How am I going to tell my family?  How do I tell them that tomorrow, we have to ...pack up our things and ...get out of the house? 
Kids! Are you tired of being harassed at school? Sick of being called a homo? A farty-pants? A butt-... face? Then call me, Kyle's dad, and I'll help you  close the lid on sexual harassment in schools!
Guys, we have a problem!  I talked to the EFSM and they say Randy has to take the crap in Zurich.
Sheila, ih-it was wrong of us to be so judgmental of Kyle. If he isn't happy with who he is, then who are we to deny hm surgery that will make him feel better about himself? 
Chef, that's Johnnie Cochran. He's the guy who knocked O. J. off.
That's it. I'm destitute.  Loan me money! You've gotta have money in the cup!  Wha- what's in the cup?
Jesus! Look at us! We all don't like the Wall-Mart, but we can't stop coming here.
He was the most upright and honorable of men, and every day he praised God. 
Relax, sweetie  I know how to count cards.
Maybe we should... strip these jackets off, and warm our bodies next to each other!
Sshhhh! I have to win it back before Sheila finds out!
Aaah, can we cross the line to take our kids to school?
Now, you go brush your teeth and march into bed!  You won't be opening your Channukah present tonight!
I forgot to tell you, ah I have a gambling problem.
Look, I'm just trying to make the people of South Park aware of a very serious problem.
Hahah. Whatever happened to that old hunk o' junk? Haha--
Yeah. It's a hybrid. I just... I just couldn't sit back and-  be a part of destroying the earth anymore.
I don't think I can do it either.
Hey Sheila. You feel like having some fun?
Well, I never really wanted to experiment with anything too crazy. You know... maybe just... I don't know... masturbate in front of another guy.
All right, time to show these people how to gamble!
They say that Bono is demanding it and that their hands are tied.
Hey.  Nothing changes between us, right? I mean, we're still friends.
You bet money on my son to win?!
Yeah, tackle box.  Man, smell that mountain air. What a great Saturday morning; aren't weekends just the best?
I'm sorry, Stan, but unfortunately you live in a small-minded town filled with ignorant boobs.
What haven't you tried that you've always wanted to try?
Uh, you know, the people really responsible for your harassment is the public schools.  Perhaps we should sue them next.
Yeah! We could have the boys do their presentation as part of our peace rally on Saturday!
Hello, honey, how has prison been for you?
This is a reenactment, Kyle. My name is Pvt. John Fugasol, and I have to do what my general tells me!
Oh! I'm sorry! I didn't think it was "high and mighty" to  care about the earth!
Nobody know anything. It's li-it's like the boys just vanished!
There you are, Kyle. I was gonna see if you and your brother wanted to go down to the bowling alley.
Which cartoon is it? What cartoon'll be so insensitive as to have Mohammad as a character?
Get up to your room right now until your mother and I figure out how to deal with this!
We thank God for our blessings this Chanukah. Our little family is so loving, and perfect, and nothing will ever tear us apart.  I'll get it. 
So much better here with the intellectuals, isn't it, boys?  Wuhh  Mmmm.
First thing is we've gotta dispose of this!
Yeah! But wait.  Three hundred and fifty thousand dollars. That means if we won again, it will be twelve and a quarter million! 
Oh, look, Kyle. Your little friend Stan is here to see you.
You know your brother watches MacNeil/Lehrer Report every night at ten!
So then, Job got painful sores all over his body. 
Twenty percent of American students aged six to twelve say they have tried cheesing at least once. Kids also refer to it as "the cheese game", or "vitamin cheese", or "Mary Jane piss in your face fun time". Cheesing is spreading fast.
Uh, well, we need to find a way to close our town off from unwanted strangers!
You see, son, fads come and go. And this "Chin-po-ko-mon" is obviously nothing more than a fad. You don't have to be a part of it. In fact, you can make an even stronger statement by saying to your peers, "I'm not going to be a part of this fad, because I'm an individual." Do you understand?
Well, I really don't see how  that has anything to do with the-
A b--uh I love dolphins, Ever since I was a child I dreamt of... Huh b-b-b- But that has hardly any bearing on what I'm hear to-
No. No, what am I thinking? I shouldn't do this.  I've been clean for ten... years. I haven't even been near a cat.  But then that report said our kids were doing it too, and... and I knew Kyle would have the same sicknesses I used to have... Now a cat is in our home, and it's too tempting.  I... I'll just do it one more time.  One. Last. Time.  Then I'll call the police; have them pick up the cat.  And then I'll never do it again.  After this one... last... time... 
What the?! ...Ike!  Ike, get back to bed right now!
All right, we're gonna hit the tables. Why don't you kids run along to the comedy club? 
And, uh Stuart, I think I owe you an apology. I realize that I shouldn't be so cold towards people that are less fortunate than me.
Oh! Sorry Randy. Looks like you got a ticket.
Yeah, those dads get REALLY drunk and obnoxious.
Yeah, well, whatever, sooo let's... not... sue anyone again. Okay, come on, guys. Let's go get some ice cream!
Oh yeah, I got a great angle here.
And to the people of South Park.  I was wrong, and I can't let cats take the fall anymore. It's our fault. The people who use cats for their sweet urine.  We have to learn that cheesing just isn't worth it. Sure, you get to fight in the Breastriary, and swim in the Fountains of Varnov with the Itty Titty Fairies of Mammary Mountain.
Uh, you don't regret doing it now, do you?
There! You have it! Straight from the horse's mouth!
That's right.  My son and his friends throw a party for a kid with diabetes.
No buts! Get back to your room right now and don't come out! You got it?! 
And so, in summation, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you've heard the version of my client's song recorded over twenty years ago. You've heard the exact same song produced by those cheats in the past month. I'd say it's pretty much an open-and-shut case. Make the right decision. Thank you.  We've got 'em. 
No, because we don't call it fascism. Do you understand?
You see boys, Jew Scouts is a special group that borrows a little bit from all different Jewish denominations. From the Orthodox Jews, from the Hasidic Jews, from the Northern Italy Cave Jews... But you have to believe the basic tenets of Judaism to be a Scout.
It's your day off. You boys really wanna spend it inside in front of the TV?
Jimbo, your truck probably gets less than ten miles to the gallon.
Well, because Kenny's family doesn't have as much money as we do.
It's so wonderful to be on the same wavelength as our kids.
Kyle, it's all about being a good person now! You see, Christians use hell as a way to scare people into believing what they believe. But to believe in something just because you're afraid of the consequences if you don't believe in something is no reason to believe in something. Understand?
Oh come on, Mr. Jefferson, you're not one of those who think that the police go around framing rich black people just because they're jealous?
Ah hey now Kyle, if you made a deal with somebody, you have to stick by it.
And so, God had a bunch of barbarians come in and slaughter Job's oxen and donkeys, and murder all his workers. 
No! Don't you see? Th-the panda's right. Boy, what a great message he has! When you sue people, you just end up causing a lot of problems for society. Uhwell, I've really learned something today. All I could see was the millions of dollars coming to me and I didn't care about where the money came from. Well, I'm no longer doing sexual harassment lawsuits in schools! They're too vague and two easily corruptible. Thank you, Sexual Harassment Panda!
Well, because they're the ones that let this harassment go on. And, they have a lot more money. I think we could get a lot more out of this than half of Stan's belongings.
Thank you, Your Honor. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, Everyone has committed a crime here, and Everyone must pay for that crime. My client, Everyone, has been hurt by this crime and must be compensated.
Oh, just great! You see, Sheila?! This is what your transgender progressive thinking gets you! Now your son wants to be transracial!
There, there, Shei-hla. There's nothing we can do. 
Uh, Token, this is very important: do you know where the boys went with the naughty tape?
Now you march to your room, and you think about what you've done!
How many times do we have to tell you this? We don't want to buy shares in a condo!
Sorry Kyle, we gave you your allowance already.
Courtney Cox, I love you.  
You're so hot  on that show.
Oh! So you admit that harassment goes on!
Think about it: you weren't even trying to take the biggest crap last time. Imagine if you actually worked at it!
It's alright, he couldn't have gone far. Let's call the other kids' houses. 
Randy, they're bringin' back Wacky Races Saturday monring!
Everyone in the car. We have to beat them there. 
But it's time for you to get back to school and on with your lives.
Did you, or did you not, hear my client being called an ass-sucker?
Oh God, is there nothing we can do?
Then why did your mother find this  in your dresser drawer?!
Hoh, I don't know. I think maybe with all the news of famous people dying this summer, he he's just freaked himself out.
Kyle, perhaps we handled this wrong, buh- but you need to understand that we don't want-
Listen to you. You're yelling at me; you've never yelled at me before.
And let's make sure nobody gets a stupid hybrid, right? 
Get out of here, you mutt! Let him go! 
Yeah. That guy probably thinks he can get us to go away by being so goofy! 
Hey, Mr. Withdrawn, you might not need to talk about it, but I sure do.
Well, that's what being young is all about. Once you have a family and a career, your experimenting days are over. But tonight is the exception; that's why I'm gonna smoke this cigar.  Only 'cause I've never smoked before. 
Wait, here's 20. Get one for your brother, too. 
That's right. So Kenny's family is happy just the way they are, and we're all a functioning part of America.
Yeah. The sand thing sounds a lot simpler. 
Oh, my brother took a crap once, that was enormous. It was the biggest in the history of the world, I think. 
Yes Kyle, but you still defied your parents. And you need to learn that terrorism is never the answer.
Oh, shove the song of the sparrow up your ass!
I'm not gonna let you change on me, Randy. Just because we shared an intimate moment in the hot tub, I won't let it change our friend-
Who the hell do you think you are?!
Yeah?! See you Saturday, makizzer shanna sharilla shaz biuznatch gazizzah!
And that's why,  I've talked it over with your mother, and  ...we've decided to MOVE!
Your honor, I'd like to make my closing arguments.
Okay, there's another one.  Aw, man! Look at that!  Can you believe this?! An SUV with a V8 engine, makes me sick!  "Ticket for driving a gas-guzzler"
Alright, that's it! I've had about enough with iCrap, and me clouds, and a council of Geniuses, with all their future-
We don't know. We were all passed out and... next thing we know we just woke up on a bus heading here.
Wow, so, everyone here drives a hybrid, huh?
Oh, really?! Well, don't you worry, Kyle. We can cover that black eye up with some cream base, and the coat and pants we'll bleach with an acid wash for a fun vintage look.
Please come home, Kyle. 
You left home lookin' for somethin' new. 
But all you need is right here waitin' for you 
Steve, uh, we heard that a bunch of the kids were over here a little while ago.
From what I understand, she's the niece of someone's coworker here in town or something.
Kyle, your mother and I don't want you going to the Raging Pussies concert! We gave you a chore that we thought was impossible. You weren't supposed to actually do it.
Yeah. I think it's great that gays are finally being so accepted. 
Now, on to double penetration, boys. You see, sometimes when a woman has sex with more than one man, each man makes love to a different orifice.
It is sick and disgusting, and we simply will not have it!
No. It's a very fragile system that nature has designed. All things flow into each other.
I have written up a bill that would make having a cat illegal in the city of South Park.
How can there be no Internet anywhere? What's going on?!
You don't know if there's any Internet in California.
Now, just let me do all the talking, Chef. We’re gonna bring these bastards down.
Don't have any change... Don't have any change... Damn it! All right, you want change? Here.   There! There's some change. All right, a little bit.  There you go. Take the change.  Oh wait. Wait, now I don't have any change left for the bus. Hold on. Can I just get back some of that change, please?
Yes. A lot of people in town just aren't ready to drive hybrid cars.
Kyle, just because Ike is adopted doesn't make him any less your brother.
Well that does it! I'm going to the police!
She sure does. I wouldn't mind takin' that home.
Oh, you wanna leave, huh?! Okay, fine, Kyle, when we get home, we'll just pack up our things, load them in the car, and we'll leave! 
As you can see, Your Honor, my client is too upset to continue.
Well, Randy, calm down. It's not a real ticket.
Well Kyle, schools have lots of money. You see, we all pay taxes, and part of that tax money goes to public schools, and it's from that money that we got our 1.3 million.
Give me that! What we do in our bedroom is our business!
What kind of nutjob would agree to surgically alter my son into a tall African-American?!
Sheila, could you pass me the dead fetus?  I mean, gravy.  Ow!
Everybody doesn't know. And why are you so ashamed of me?
Okay, that'll be great. Let's also make sure we have enough chairs in the community center for everyone to attend.
Oh yes. You've got one too, I see.
I, uh, I-I-I read about it in People.
He was not really a Broflovski, he was Canadian. But we loved him all the same. 
Huh? Oh, uh, no thanks, I brought my own. Microbrew sampler from Aspen. Has six different beers from local breweries.  Sahay, remember that time we built the fort in your mom's back yard?
That doctor is a miracle worker, Sheila. Iiii'm the happiest I've ever been.  Look, Ike! You're daddy's a dolphin! 
Yeah, I guess these passes the time-share salesman gave us will come in handy.
We'll wish we spent the money when we have a lawsuit on our hands.
Stan, a class-action lawsuit means the end of this town. We can't possibly go up against their lawyers!
Hurry, you guys! The mall closes in seven hours!
Principal Victoria, were you aware that my client was being harassed at your school?
Hup, we did. We've come to terms with it through therapy and learned to admit it.
Kyle, Ike says you kicked him off the TV.
We need to be where everyone is motivated and progressive like us! Start getting your things packed, boys! The Broflovksi family is moving to San Francisco! 
Thanks for releasing them to us, detective. Sorry for all the trouble they caused.
Oh, I think you'll see differently after hearing this. Sit down, Kyle.  Uh, okay.  You see, Job lived in the east of Jordan, a long long time ago.  Job was a great man. He was blessed with ten lovely children , a wonderful wife, and many friends. 
Congratulations, boys! You're goin' on to the post-season. Woohoo!
Yeah! Let's all go shop at Jim's Drugs down the street! 
Uh not this again.  Ike, we are sick of you talking about ghosts!
Just look at how big this house is, Kyle. Just look at it.
The casino gave me credit! I put the house up as collateral! But I still have this ten-dollar chip.
Now, you get to sleep, and think about how your poor mother has to clean that bathroom up!
They were so scared, I'm sure they'll never be back!
So call me, Kyle's dad. Because it's not about money, it's about... wait, what am I saying? Call me! 
All right, calm down. Now, just how bad of a porno tape are we talking here? I mean, was it like Crotch Capers 3?
Kidding? Well, that's not funny! That hurt my feelings!
Oh yes there is! You could do it again!
We have to protect our children from this, Sheila.
Can I have just a little change for the bus, please? I need a little... anybody have some change? Change? Got any change?  Change. Change? 
Come on, honey. It says our Handicar is just pulling up.
Well, Kyle, it's always the agreeing party's responsibility to know what they are signing.
And then you fight the Boob Goblin in the Gazongas Cave, and then the girl may thank you for it. But she. Isn't. Real.
I just want to know it meant something to you.
You know, the emissions from a vehicle like yours causes irreparable damage to the ozone. I drive a hybrid; it's much better for the environment.  Thanks.
No, no, no, if you wanna leave South Park, fine! Tomorrow we're leaving!
Alright Kyle!  Excuse me, where do you have special seating for dolphins?
Uhh, Kyle, uh sometimes when people get older they need to play and pretend to keep things interesting. Iiit's just a way I can still be intimate with your mother without relying on silly sexual enhancement drugs. 
With my super lawyer powers, we can rid our town of cats, so that our kids can never get high again!
Well you bet your ass it'll come to that!
You have been very very naughty!  You're a naughty girl! 
Disgraceful! Stan and Kyle, it's up to you to show all those war-mongerers that the Founding Fathers agree with us!
All right, that does it! Come on, Kyle, I don't want you hanging around with these ignorant idiots! 
What? Th'um, nuh-nothing. I- I'll explain it to you when you're a little older.
I hate to say it, but I think Priest Maxi was right. This is what we get for celebrating Halloween and allowing that band KoRn to come play.
Geez I really wish this guy would shut up.
But, what if you're not ready at 17?
So, Mr. Jefferson, did I hear you say you moved here from Kentucky?
Look, Kyle, adults make up those things because they're fun for children.
All right.  I swear I'll never understand you kids these days.
Well, I have something to give to her!  Don't worry, Kyle. Everything's gonna be okay between me and your mom.
A communist country run by a dictator named Fidel Castro.
Harder for Peter?! Now you two just blow in here and say you're gonna haul him back to Canada, and we're being hard on Peter?!
I don't need you wiping my ass for me. I'm a grown man.
Well Butters, we think... that this is one of the BEST books we've ever read.
Huh, well, two girls, of course! I mean ...with another guy, you know, that'd be... 
A-Aspen? Uuuh, we, we can't really afford that.
Well, we'll find them. A-and then we'll try to put what they saw into context.
You see, Kyle, we live in a liberal, democratic society. And Democrats make sexual harassment laws. These laws tell us what we can and can't say in the workplace. And what we can and can't do in the workplace.
All we know is they were seen hanging out with Craig and now they're gone.
What? Now why the hell would you knowingly deceive me like that?
Well, Kyle, that's not a reason to buy something.
Oh! Kyle, appealing to the Prime Minister of Canada would take... time and money we don't have.
Yeah, well, you know my son is just  a little bit more clever than some.
Normally, we do it right after the baby is born, but we had to do it later for Ike because he's a--
No.  No, our Internet can't be broken. Ah, I've gotta get an attachment Larry sent me last night.
And then, as Job's sons and daughters were eating, God sent a mighty wind to collapse the house and crush and kill them all. 
Problem is, the more you into that world, the more you need to go. Until you start blowing off all the real people who care about you. 
Wow! It seems like you had a great time with the Super Adventure Club, Chef. They sound like really interesting people.
I-I'm sorry, but none of us can really afford to own our own vacation condo.
Yeah. Yeah, I think it's best we just do it right away.
Huh that's right! And I also happen to be a lawyer! And I'm gonna have you sued for malpractice, and your clinic shut down!!
Oh, you heard him, Sheila! Kyle wants to leave! Our nice old house doesn't interest Kyle anymore! Well I'm calling the moving company right now! 
Can somebody please explain to me what is going on?!
Everyone get your stuff; we can take my car.
Look, you gave Ike up. You can't just change your mind.
But Satan said, "Oh yeah? He only praises you because you gave him so much. If you didn't give him those things, he would curse your name."
You're so right about this place. It's wonderful.
Oh, yeah, love it! I haven't done it for a while, though. I had to go out and buy a few things, you know a-. A rod and a reel and an uh, uuh...
Mr. Garrison, do you know the definition of sexual harassment?
To find out where Apple is keeping my son!
Whattaya mean it sounds like shit? This doesn't sound like shit.
This isn't a joke, Kyle! Bombs have already gone off in six cities!
Kyle, you'd better stop being anti-Semitic right now, mister!!
Tell Ike how much fun Squirts is, Kyle.
Yeah.  Actually, we saw a bear a few miles back.
Calm down, Kyle! It's okay. You're safe with Daddy. 
Well, I'm sure you'll find another job soon. Something'll come along.
No, I don't know how it is. I use a PC.
But our homes and our lives are at stake.
Sheila, let me handle this.  Having imaginary friends is fine, Kyle, but this simply will not do!
Yeah. I'm just, you know, trying to make people more aware ya' know, it's a-
Randy, you're making me feel unimportant. Talk. Talk, damn you.
I wish. That's the one thing I've always thought of experimenting with. A threesome.
Here- here you go. And and don't go to the store down the block. The one four miles away in Fairplay has better pretzels.
Ugh... Alright, fine! I'll sign up with Apple.
I would like to address a personal matter: I have let myself down. And I would first like to apologize to my lovely wife.
My son was kidnapped by Apple and they are holding him against his will!!
Cats aren't the problem. We made cats illegal and and then I cheesed for the first time in ten years. And kids are always gonna find a new way to get high. Like sniffing glue or licking toads, or fermenting feces or huffing paint. You can also look at-
Oh my God! Sheila! Come look at this!
Nooo! I don't wanna join Apple, I like my PC!
I'm a big boy. I took a big boy poop.
Kyle, we're so sorry for the horrible sexual abuse over the years. But we're all better now.
Right right, w-would, would you like red or white wine?
I don't know. Come on, Kyle! You're gonna be late for Jew Scouts!
Oh, all right. Just don't let any of the elders know that he isn't Jewish, okay?
And if it weren't for you people flexing your arms, America could easily get taken over by terrorists or... or China.
That does it! I'm taking you boys OUT OF THAT SCHOOL! 
I-it is the single most vile, twisted, dark piece of porn ever made. 
Hello?  I I'm sorry, I just really need some change for the bus?
So, does this mean I'm not really a dolphin?
Yes, it is big, isn't it? It is very big.
Hey, come on. We should take a tour of the Smithsonian before we head back.
UPS man. I have a ...package from Amazon for you.
Expert witness, did South Park Elementary allow sexual harassment to go on?
Kyle, what on earth has gotten into you?!
There can't be anything in that agreement that allows a company to do what they're talking about to Kyle!
If I can make it through them, maybe I can catch the bus to Fairplay. I have to try.
You're just jealous. You're a bitter old drunk, just like your father!  Ow!! 
God said to Satan, "See? I told you. Job still praises me." 
Well your ad said we only had to attend a thirty-minute meeting.
Eh excuse me, where, where is the bathroom for dolphins?
Hey, you know Kobe Bryant was up in Eagle today.
It wasn't our idea to take out Santa Claus! 
Hey! I worked my ass off to get to where I am today!  I wanted to be somebody!
Three hundred dollars?? What in the world for??
Oh no, seriously, this crap was a monster! 
What? Oh. Kyle, let's have a little talk. 
I wouldn't count on it. Come on, boys, get in the car! 
Wulluh uh I just felt like talkin' to you.
Ike, your brother Kyle was in Squirts, and so was I. You have to go so someday you can be a big brave Jew Scout.
Oh, now what's gotten into him? Stan, will you go talk to him? 
Oh, I don't know. I think our boys might just have the dead fetus to win-- Heart!
Ha ha ha ha ha! Ooh-ho boy, have you got a lot to learn! Sit down, son.  You see, Kyle, we humans work as a society, and in order for a society to thrive, we need gods, and clods.
Yeah, we may not have gotten to ski earlier, but with this lift we'll get more runs in than anybody.
But it has to work! Maybe if I do a little-
Hm.  You know, Eric, I've been thinking, uh...
It doesn't matter! Ten to eleven is Ike's time to watch MacNeil/Lehrer
Good-bye, Ike. You...  be a good bye, huh? You... remember all the things we taught you. 
No. Kyle, she's just make-believe. Like Peter Pan.
Damnit you people have to make special arrangements for transspecies people like me! I may be a dolphin, but I'm also a lawyer!
I thought we agreed what happened in the hot tub wouldn't change our relationship.
Look out for your brother, Kyle. You're the man now.
Your teacher had a sex change?? Oh my God! 
It's okay, Kyle. Just... be a good boy.
Excuse me, the front door was open. Can I borrow some change? 
Yes. You see, I spent a lot of time going to law school, and I was able to go because I have a slightly higher intellect than others. But I still need people to pump my gas, and make my French fries, and fix my laundry machine when it breaks down.
Come on, everybody! Let's go buy wasteful gas guzzlers! 
Haven't you boys heard anything about how harmful smoking is to you and those around you?
Kyle! Kyle, can we talk to you for a minute, please?
He's a teacher! How are we supposed to explain this to our children?!
Kyle! Kyle, wake up!  We have to go! The terrorists are attacking!
I'd better just... take it down to the basement for now, m-make sure Kyle can't find it. 
Well where else was I gonna get a napkin dispenser at nine thirty at night?
Oh no! Y-you guys all turned gay too?? 
Principal Victoria, was Eric Cartman called an ass-sucker? Yes or no?
We'll be back to pick you up after the meteor shower party, boys.
Yeah... Ih it's time we told the boys the truth, that they aren't really going to get to heaven.
