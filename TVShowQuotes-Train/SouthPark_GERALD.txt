What, What did you say?

Hup, we did. We've come to terms with it through therapy and learned to admit it.

Apologize to him!

Randy! We've looked everywhere! Kyle's missing too!

Hello, everybody. Say, can I join in?

How many times do we have to tell you this? We don't want to buy shares in a condo!

Shh, shh! We've got the television working! 

This is the worst thing that's happened in this town!  The worst thing!

We'ge gotta get our boys back! 

Uh, you don't regret doing it now, do you?

Oh, that does it!

Sure is. 

But our homes and our lives are at stake.

Eh excuse me, where, where is the bathroom for dolphins?

You're so hot

God help them all.

They say that Bono is demanding it and that their hands are tied.

Huh?

Ow!

Three hundred dollars?? What in the world for??

Huh that's right! And I also happen to be a lawyer! And I'm gonna have you sued for malpractice, and your clinic shut down!!

Oh come on, Mr. Jefferson, you're not one of those who think that the police go around framing rich black people just because they're jealous?

To find out where Apple is keeping my son!

Hey, you know Kobe Bryant was up in Eagle today.

Oh, all right. Just don't let any of the elders know that he isn't Jewish, okay?

Yes. A lot of people in town just aren't ready to drive hybrid cars.

Wow.

A b--uh I love dolphins, Ever since I was a child I dreamt of... Huh b-b-b- But that has hardly any bearing on what I'm hear to-

Don't have any change... Don't have any change... Damn it! All right, you want change? Here.   There! There's some change. All right, a little bit.  There you go. Take the change.  Oh wait. Wait, now I don't have any change left for the bus. Hold on. Can I just get back some of that change, please?

They were so scared, I'm sure they'll never be back!

Huh? What do you think? You know you like it.

I wanna educate you kids with some real music.  This is The Police. Now you compare this to Tween pop and tell us which one you think is real music. 

Yeah?! See you Saturday, makizzer shanna sharilla shaz biuznatch gazizzah!

No. It's a very fragile system that nature has designed. All things flow into each other.

Oh my God! Come on, Sheila!  We'd better go tell the other parents what's going on!! 

Uh, you know, the people really responsible for your harassment is the public schools.  Perhaps we should sue them next.

You see boys, Jew Scouts is a special group that borrows a little bit from all different Jewish denominations. From the Orthodox Jews, from the Hasidic Jews, from the Northern Italy Cave Jews... But you have to believe the basic tenets of Judaism to be a Scout.

Damnit you people have to make special arrangements for transspecies people like me! I may be a dolphin, but I'm also a lawyer!

Oh, you wanna leave, huh?! Okay, fine, Kyle, when we get home, we'll just pack up our things, load them in the car, and we'll leave! 

Get up to your room right now until your mother and I figure out how to deal with this!

Yeah. We sure are.

Kids!

Sorry I'm late.

Kyle, you'd better stop being anti-Semitic right now, mister!!

No. No, what am I thinking? I shouldn't do this.  I've been clean for ten... years. I haven't even been near a cat.  But then that report said our kids were doing it too, and... and I knew Kyle would have the same sicknesses I used to have... Now a cat is in our home, and it's too tempting.  I... I'll just do it one more time.  One. Last. Time.  Then I'll call the police; have them pick up the cat.  And then I'll never do it again.  After this one... last... time... 

Pan-Panda's mouth.

Come on, everybody! Let's go buy wasteful gas guzzlers! 

You don't know if there's any Internet in California.

Get him in the ribs! 

Now you march to your room, and you think about what you've done!

Good-bye!

Yeah, I know what you mean.

Hey everybody. Good to see you again. 

Oh my God!

You don't know?! You're the principal!

As you can see, Your Honor, my client is too upset to continue.

First thing is we've gotta dispose of this!

That's what we're here for.

Oh, I think you'll see differently after hearing this. Sit down, Kyle.  Uh, okay.  You see, Job lived in the east of Jordan, a long long time ago.  Job was a great man. He was blessed with ten lovely children , a wonderful wife, and many friends. 

That's it. I'm gonna make a break for it.

Yeah, lie.

Principal Victoria, was Eric Cartman called an ass-sucker? Yes or no?

Well, that's what being young is all about. Once you have a family and a career, your experimenting days are over. But tonight is the exception; that's why I'm gonna smoke this cigar.  Only 'cause I've never smoked before. 

Courtney Cox,

I-it is the single most vile, twisted, dark piece of porn ever made. 

So then, Job got painful sores all over his body. 

That's what our boys were talking about?

Me neither.

Oh, hello, son. 

Oh, that's disgusting!!! Now, now stop this!!

Oh, those weren't mints, those were antacid tablets.

I- huh? 

Yeah, tackle box.  Man, smell that mountain air. What a great Saturday morning; aren't weekends just the best?

Hey. Talk to me.

Again!

Hoh, I don't know. I think maybe with all the news of famous people dying this summer, he he's just freaked himself out.

Stinger?

If I can make it through them, maybe I can catch the bus to Fairplay. I have to try.

Oh, I don't know. I think our boys might just have the dead fetus to win-- Heart!

My son was kidnapped by Apple and they are holding him against his will!!

Thank you, Your Honor. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, Everyone has committed a crime here, and Everyone must pay for that crime. My client, Everyone, has been hurt by this crime and must be compensated.

The casino gave me credit! I put the house up as collateral! But I still have this ten-dollar chip.

Hey! I worked my ass off to get to where I am today!  I wanted to be somebody!

Lucky.

Uh huh.

Huuuh!

Your honor, I'd like to make my closing arguments.

Well? What do you think, huh? 

Well? What do you think, Kyle?

We'll be back to pick you up after the meteor shower party, boys.

I'm sorry, Stan, but unfortunately you live in a small-minded town filled with ignorant boobs.

Courtney Cox,

So, so now we can't be friends?

Hey! W-what are you saying? What "types"?

Well you bet your ass it'll come to that!

Get out of the way, Peterson! 

There was no war months ago!

And to the people of South Park.  I was wrong, and I can't let cats take the fall anymore. It's our fault. The people who use cats for their sweet urine.  We have to learn that cheesing just isn't worth it. Sure, you get to fight in the Breastriary, and swim in the Fountains of Varnov with the Itty Titty Fairies of Mammary Mountain.

Oh no, seriously, this crap was a monster! 

How did this happen?

Alright, that's it! I've had about enough with iCrap, and me clouds, and a council of Geniuses, with all their future-

I agree.

What?

Kyle, Ike says you kicked him off the TV.

We can't destroy it, son. We have to learn to live with it.

I love you.

You're just jealous. You're a bitter old drunk, just like your father!  Ow!! 

Yeah?  Do you like your package, ma'am? 

Yeah. That's right.

Hey there. Alan, right?

Yyeeaahh!!!!

Oh no! Y-you guys all turned gay too?? 

Guys, we have a problem!  I talked to the EFSM and they say Randy has to take the crap in Zurich.

I just don't get it.  Why would he invite me fishing and then turn into a complete bastard?

Like it.

Well, I really don't see how  that has anything to do with the-

He's a teacher! How are we supposed to explain this to our children?!

Oh, look, Kyle. Your little friend Stan is here to see you.

Can I have just a little change for the bus, please? I need a little... anybody have some change? Change? Got any change?  Change. Change? 

Haven't you boys heard anything about how harmful smoking is to you and those around you?

Stephen, what are you doing?

Wow! It seems like you had a great time with the Super Adventure Club, Chef. They sound like really interesting people.

Yeah... Ih it's time we told the boys the truth, that they aren't really going to get to heaven. 

Kyle, perhaps we handled this wrong, buh- but you need to understand that we don't want-

Hey Randy.

What? Th'um, nuh-nothing. I- I'll explain it to you when you're a little older.

They, they're... they're playing street hockey!

Randy. What happened?

Think about it: you weren't even trying to take the biggest crap last time. Imagine if you actually worked at it!

It sure did.

Kyle, it's all about being a good person now! You see, Christians use hell as a way to scare people into believing what they believe. But to believe in something just because you're afraid of the consequences if you don't believe in something is no reason to believe in something. Understand?

We'll wish we spent the money when we have a lawsuit on our hands.

Where am I?

Good-bye, Ike. You...  be a good bye, huh? You... remember all the things we taught you. 

Yeah, it's really amazing.

Yeah! Let's all go shop at Jim's Drugs down the street! 

I'm a big boy. I took a big boy poop.

Dear God, it's been over thirteen hours!

And who's to blame?

That son of a bitch ripped my parka! 

Sheila, ih-it was wrong of us to be so judgmental of Kyle. If he isn't happy with who he is, then who are we to deny hm surgery that will make him feel better about himself? 

Courtney Cox,

What?!

No, I don't know how it is. I use a PC.

There's nothing I can do.

Wow, I'm good!

Uhh, Kyle, uh sometimes when people get older they need to play and pretend to keep things interesting. Iiit's just a way I can still be intimate with your mother without relying on silly sexual enhancement drugs. 

The point is, I was wrong. Its time to legalize cats!  Heh yeah! Hooray for Gerald! Hey, let's hear it for Gerald! 

Hahah. Whatever happened to that old hunk o' junk? Haha--

Oh, God, what have I done?

And you did nothing.

Yeah.

Yeah, I guess so.

Yes, it is big, isn't it? It is very big.

You're dreaming!

Oh, just great! You see, Sheila?! This is what your transgender progressive thinking gets you! Now your son wants to be transracial!

I just want to know it meant something to you.

...Sorry, I don't think I get your-

Sorry Kyle, we gave you your allowance already.

Well, Kyle, that's not a reason to buy something.

Ohh, not so good.

And that's why,  I've talked it over with your mother, and  ...we've decided to MOVE!

Everyone in the car. We have to beat them there. 

Good idea.

Oh. Uhhh, I don't know.

They're scared to death!

Kyle, let me explain something to you.

Kids! Are you tired of being harassed at school? Sick of being called a homo? A farty-pants? A butt-... face? Then call me, Kyle's dad, and I'll help you  close the lid on sexual harassment in schools!

You're so hot

That goes in the master bedroom.  Well, Kyle. What do you think of your new house?

on that show.

Huh?

Look, there's a Jeep over there! Go write them a ticket, Kyle!

Now, now-I, I wasn't lucky.

Come on, honey. It says our Handicar is just pulling up.

That doctor is a miracle worker, Sheila. Iiii'm the happiest I've ever been.  Look, Ike! You're daddy's a dolphin! 

Huh... how come?

Yeah. Yeah, I think it's best we just do it right away.

So much better here with the intellectuals, isn't it, boys?  Wuhh  Mmmm.

Honey?

Maybe we should... strip these jackets off, and warm our bodies next to each other!

What? Oh. Kyle, let's have a little talk. 

She sure does. I wouldn't mind takin' that home.

You're so right about this place. It's wonderful.

Well, I totally agree, Kyle.

You didn't say not to tell anyone.

Kyle! You look terrible! 

I wouldn't count on it. Come on, boys, get in the car! 

Yeah, I guess these passes the time-share salesman gave us will come in handy.

Hm.  You know, Eric, I've been thinking, uh...

I have written up a bill that would make having a cat illegal in the city of South Park.

Hey Sheila. You feel like having some fun?

Aha. 

One question?

Wow, neat!

Oh Jesus...  I feel warm too!

I used to think I was crazy. But Dr, Biber told me that there are a lot of other people out there who are transspecies. All I did is change my appearance to look the way I felt...  here. And I'm telling you now that if we don't let Kyle do the same, he may never be happy. Ever! We owe him more than that, Sheila. We owe him understanding! 

No, no, no, if you wanna leave South Park, fine! Tomorrow we're leaving!

Calm down, Kyle! It's okay. You're safe with Daddy. 

You are?

He can't do that!

That's what being young is all about.

Dammit..!

I would like to address a personal matter: I have let myself down. And I would first like to apologize to my lovely wife.

Oh, yeah, love it! I haven't done it for a while, though. I had to go out and buy a few things, you know a-. A rod and a reel and an uh, uuh...

Okay, boys. Do you have any questions? 

It's so wonderful to be on the same wavelength as our kids.

He’s using the Chewbacca defense.

We've gotta get out of here!

What the?! ...Ike!  Ike, get back to bed right now!

The answer is no, Kyle.

Yeah. Now THIS, is a house. 

Kyle! Kyle, wake up!  We have to go! The terrorists are attacking!

That brave, brave man.

Very good, Ike. That's two John Steinbeck books in one day.

How can there be no Internet anywhere? What's going on?!

UPS man. I have a ...package from Amazon for you.

Hello, Kyle. How's the hemorrhoid today?

Stop the game! 

What? Now why the hell would you knowingly deceive me like that?

Well what the heck does this w-! 

Punching trees?

I agree.

So call me, Kyle's dad. Because it's not about money, it's about... wait, what am I saying? Call me! 

We said we'd never tell anybody?

Ow! You son of a bitch! 

Yeah, well, whatever, sooo let's... not... sue anyone again. Okay, come on, guys. Let's go get some ice cream!

Isn't he responding at all, doctor?

I I'm not sure.

Hi Sharon. Uh, we need to talk to you about the boys.

Okay! Finally! How do we do that?

I don't think I can do it either.

Courtney Cox,

Maybe you can make a difference, Stan.  Maybe you can get everyone to drive hybrid cars. Until that day,  we're just gonna have to be  with our own kind. 

Well Butters, we think... that this is one of the BEST books we've ever read.

Relax, sweetie  I know how to count cards.

My God, can you believe those people?!

Sshhhh! I have to win it back before Sheila finds out!

I thought we agreed what happened in the hot tub wouldn't change our relationship.

It's your day off. You boys really wanna spend it inside in front of the TV?

It doesn't matter! Ten to eleven is Ike's time to watch MacNeil/Lehrer

Who the hell do you think you are?!

Ugh... Alright, fine! I'll sign up with Apple.

Kyle, have you been getting high?!

Congratulations, boys! You're goin' on to the post-season. Woohoo!

No, because we don't call it fascism. Do you understand?

How did you do it, Kyle?

Hurry, you guys! The mall closes in seven hours!

Thuh that's right. It's just harmless experimenting.

I'm sorry, honey.

Finally, we get to go skiing!

Oh, uuhh. I don't know. 

Oh! So you admit that harassment goes on!

How am I going to tell my family?  How do I tell them that tomorrow, we have to ...pack up our things and ...get out of the house? 

Mm-hmm.

Harder for Peter?! Now you two just blow in here and say you're gonna haul him back to Canada, and we're being hard on Peter?!

Pressure us?! You kept us all day yesterday and then had a chair lift bring us back!

Well your ad said we only had to attend a thirty-minute meeting.

You're so hot

We don't know. We were all passed out and... next thing we know we just woke up on a bus heading here.

Thanks.

It could be nationwide.

Oh, my brother took a crap once, that was enormous. It was the biggest in the history of the world, I think. 

What kind of nutjob would agree to surgically alter my son into a tall African-American?!

There can't be anything in that agreement that allows a company to do what they're talking about to Kyle!

Well, they were probably real.

This is a reenactment, Kyle. My name is Pvt. John Fugasol, and I have to do what my general tells me!

Yeah. I think it's great that gays are finally being so accepted. 

KYLE!

You do??

Well that does it! I'm going to the police!

HAAAAAA!!!  Kyle! What's happened to you??

Stephen!  Stephen, you have to keep moving!

Well, I never really wanted to experiment with anything too crazy. You know... maybe just... I don't know... masturbate in front of another guy.

Kyle, where's your mother?

That Dr. Biber is about to get his ass bitten off! 

Thanks for releasing them to us, detective. Sorry for all the trouble they caused.

That's right. So Kenny's family is happy just the way they are, and we're all a functioning part of America.

Oh yes. You've got one too, I see.

If you'll just...  sign right here. 

And... the rest of the country?

Ow! 

Courtney Cox,

I'd better just... take it down to the basement for now, m-make sure Kyle can't find it. 

And then you fight the Boob Goblin in the Gazongas Cave, and then the girl may thank you for it. But she. Isn't. Real.

Oh, shove the song of the sparrow up your ass!

So, Mr. Jefferson, did I hear you say you moved here from Kentucky?

Kyle, y-you-you just don't understand. It's--

Problem is, the more you into that world, the more you need to go. Until you start blowing off all the real people who care about you. 

Mr. Garrison, do you know the definition of sexual harassment?

Yeah. That guy probably thinks he can get us to go away by being so goofy! 

Look, you gave Ike up. You can't just change your mind.

Yeah, those dads get REALLY drunk and obnoxious.

I don't have any urges!

Now, I want you to repeat after me: 'There is no such thing as Mr. Hankey'

Get out of here, you mutt! Let him go! 

Mm-hmm.

He was not really a Broflovski, he was Canadian. But we loved him all the same. 

Oh my God! Sheila! Come look at this!

All right! We did it, Eric!

Yeah. I'm just, you know, trying to make people more aware ya' know, it's a-

on that show.

An agreement to do what?!

What's that?

Let it ride!!

Kyle, what did you do?!

So uh. Well. That was certainly... interesting.

Oh, right.

That's right.  My son and his friends throw a party for a kid with diabetes.

That does it! I'm taking you boys OUT OF THAT SCHOOL! 

Uh, well, we need to find a way to close our town off from unwanted strangers!

Uh-oh.

Open this door!

Hey, Mr. Withdrawn, you might not need to talk about it, but I sure do.

We can't! Don't you get it?! There's no Internet to find out why there's no Internet!

Oh my God! 

It was Backdoor Sluts 9.

on that show.

And, uh Stuart, I think I owe you an apology. I realize that I shouldn't be so cold towards people that are less fortunate than me.

Here they come! 

Everything okay in here, Kyle?

What?! You don't even have a wife, Jimbo! 

Disgraceful! Stan and Kyle, it's up to you to show all those war-mongerers that the Founding Fathers agree with us!

Everyone get your stuff; we can take my car.

All right, time to show these people how to gamble!

Well, uh uh a few people, yeah.

A communist country run by a dictator named Fidel Castro.

Yeah. It's a hybrid. I just... I just couldn't sit back and-  be a part of destroying the earth anymore.

Hey, boys, how's the research coming?

Killing our kids? 

Well, I have something to give to her!  Don't worry, Kyle. Everything's gonna be okay between me and your mom.

Huh, well, two girls, of course! I mean ...with another guy, you know, that'd be... 

We have to protect our children from this, Sheila.

Hey there, Richard!

We are all trying to create the future!  I'm part of the future now too. I have sat with the Council of Geniuses, performed the Toran Ra, and I've even been to me. Mr. Jobs, you have done so much for the world. You have helped connect everyone to each other.  Clearly, this is the future. But... but can't we just slow down and enjoy the present... a little longer?

Oh God, is there nothing we can do?

Whoops.

And then, as Job's sons and daughters were eating, God sent a mighty wind to collapse the house and crush and kill them all. 

With my super lawyer powers, we can rid our town of cats, so that our kids can never get high again!

Last, I'd like to bring up my expert witness: Sexual Harassment Panda.

What?  Get out of here, kid!

We're rooting for the Broncos here, Jakov!

Yes. You see, I spent a lot of time going to law school, and I was able to go because I have a slightly higher intellect than others. But I still need people to pump my gas, and make my French fries, and fix my laundry machine when it breaks down.

But it has to work! Maybe if I do a little-

Yes Kyle, but you still defied your parents. And you need to learn that terrorism is never the answer.

Nooo! I don't wanna join Apple, I like my PC!

Sheila, let me handle this.  Having imaginary friends is fine, Kyle, but this simply will not do!

NOW, KYLE! 

The police work for time-share, too? 

Come in. You can use our Internet until you figure out what to do.

I'm going with you.

What can we do, Randy?

Kyle, what are you doing in there?

Oho...  Thanks. 

Whattaya mean it sounds like shit? This doesn't sound like shit.

Well, Randy, calm down. It's not a real ticket.

Chef, that's Johnnie Cochran. He's the guy who knocked O. J. off.

Yes?

How long have you been on the cheese?!

Now, just let me do all the talking, Chef. We’re gonna bring these bastards down.

What was the agreement?

Yeah, well, you know my son is just  a little bit more clever than some.

Your teacher had a sex change?? Oh my God! 

Randy, they're bringin' back Wacky Races Saturday monring!

Who? Stuart? Yeah, yeah, I guess we were.

Oh! Hi, Kyle. 

Oh yeah, I got a great angle here.

Meaning we're going to circumcise him. 

What th- Look, they're- They're dolphins! Why?

Probably not.

Muff cabbage?

Stop it! I really do need change!

Well, we'll find them. A-and then we'll try to put what they saw into context.

Now, you get to sleep, and think about how your poor mother has to clean that bathroom up!

I love you.

I love you.

Well Kyle?

Principal Victoria, were you aware that my client was being harassed at your school?

Yes, it certainly is.

Say it!

I doubt it. 

Kidding? Well, that's not funny! That hurt my feelings!

And so, God had a bunch of barbarians come in and slaughter Job's oxen and donkeys, and murder all his workers. 

I'm not gonna let you change on me, Randy. Just because we shared an intimate moment in the hot tub, I won't let it change our friend-

No! Don't you see? Th-the panda's right. Boy, what a great message he has! When you sue people, you just end up causing a lot of problems for society. Uhwell, I've really learned something today. All I could see was the millions of dollars coming to me and I didn't care about where the money came from. Well, I'm no longer doing sexual harassment lawsuits in schools! They're too vague and two easily corruptible. Thank you, Sexual Harassment Panda!

There, there, Shei-hla. There's nothing we can do. 

All right, calm down. Now, just how bad of a porno tape are we talking here? I mean, was it like Crotch Capers 3?

No.  No, our Internet can't be broken. Ah, I've gotta get an attachment Larry sent me last night.

How was it, honey?

Now, Kyle!

...No.  No, no, it's crazy.

Wow, filet mignon' and lobster!

Well Kyle, schools have lots of money. You see, we all pay taxes, and part of that tax money goes to public schools, and it's from that money that we got our 1.3 million.

It's okay... it's dead.

Well, I'm sure you'll find another job soon. Something'll come along.

Kyle, just because Ike is adopted doesn't make him any less your brother.

Ike, your brother Kyle was in Squirts, and so was I. You have to go so someday you can be a big brave Jew Scout.

You know, the emissions from a vehicle like yours causes irreparable damage to the ozone. I drive a hybrid; it's much better for the environment.  Thanks.

Here I come! 

You see, son, fads come and go. And this "Chin-po-ko-mon" is obviously nothing more than a fad. You don't have to be a part of it. In fact, you can make an even stronger statement by saying to your peers, "I'm not going to be a part of this fad, because I'm an individual." Do you understand?

I don't know. Come on, Kyle! You're gonna be late for Jew Scouts!

Look, Kyle, adults make up those things because they're fun for children.

Hey, Randy. What are you doing? 

How much was bail this time? 

A Handicar? What's that?

...Oh, sorry.

Alright Kyle!  Excuse me, where do you have special seating for dolphins?

Uhhh... Mind your... mother, smart-ass.

So full of metaphor.

Hello?  I I'm sorry, I just really need some change for the bus?

Cruise's lawyers were very specific boys. He's sending a limo for Muhammad to meet him outside of town.

Well, Kyle, it's always the agreeing party's responsibility to know what they are signing.

A-Aspen? Uuuh, we, we can't really afford that.

Randy, what is this?

Right. Right-right.

Mrs. Garrison, grab Kyle!

Kyle, your mother and I don't want you going to the Raging Pussies concert! We gave you a chore that we thought was impossible. You weren't supposed to actually do it.

Normally, we do it right after the baby is born, but we had to do it later for Ike because he's a--

What? You do?

What haven't you tried that you've always wanted to try?

All right, we're gonna hit the tables. Why don't you kids run along to the comedy club? 

Oh, now what's gotten into him? Stan, will you go talk to him? 

Take it easy. We'll find him.

Backdoor Sluts 9?!?

I wish. That's the one thing I've always thought of experimenting with. A threesome.

Hello, honey, how has prison been for you?

Kyle! Kyle, can we talk to you for a minute, please?

But Satan said, "Oh yeah? He only praises you because you gave him so much. If you didn't give him those things, he would curse your name."

Wulluh uh I just felt like talkin' to you.

I hate to say it, but I think Priest Maxi was right. This is what we get for celebrating Halloween and allowing that band KoRn to come play.

You bet money on my son to win?!

Huh? Oh, uh, no thanks, I brought my own. Microbrew sampler from Aspen. Has six different beers from local breweries.  Sahay, remember that time we built the fort in your mom's back yard?

Twenty percent of American students aged six to twelve say they have tried cheesing at least once. Kids also refer to it as "the cheese game", or "vitamin cheese", or "Mary Jane piss in your face fun time". Cheesing is spreading fast.

Oh, really?! Well, don't you worry, Kyle. We can cover that black eye up with some cream base, and the coat and pants we'll bleach with an acid wash for a fun vintage look.

We need to be where everyone is motivated and progressive like us! Start getting your things packed, boys! The Broflovksi family is moving to San Francisco! 

Tell Ike how much fun Squirts is, Kyle.

Uh, what are they doing?

So it DOES go on!!!

Yeah. Can we go now, please?

Hello, boys. 

Well where else was I gonna get a napkin dispenser at nine thirty at night?

Did you, or did you not, hear my client being called an ass-sucker?

Look, Ike is our son now!

Jesus...

Yes, that's mine.

Oh! Sorry Randy. Looks like you got a ticket.

Stan, a class-action lawsuit means the end of this town. We can't possibly go up against their lawyers!

Oh! Kyle, appealing to the Prime Minister of Canada would take... time and money we don't have.

Can somebody please explain to me what is going on?!

Hold on, boys. We still have to go to the hardware store, and hand out awareness citations to SUV cars in the parking lot.

No. Kyle, she's just make-believe. Like Peter Pan.

What is it, Kyle?

Yeah! But wait.  Three hundred and fifty thousand dollars. That means if we won again, it will be twelve and a quarter million! 

What the hell's goin' on out here?! 

Just look at how big this house is, Kyle. Just look at it.

So, does this mean I'm not really a dolphin?

I-I'm sorry, but none of us can really afford to own our own vacation condo.

Don't answer that!

And what do we tell our kids?! We can't leave them in the dark!

No buts! Get back to your room right now and don't come out! You got it?! 

Cha-a-ange?

It wasn't your life yesterday. 

Oh, uh I didn't realize that. 

What did you say?!

I forgot to tell you, ah I have a gambling problem.

I, uh, I-I-I read about it in People.

Why?

Kyle, we're so sorry for the horrible sexual abuse over the years. But we're all better now.

Are you guys parked over here?

Why?! 

Yeah, dirty lungs!

Excuse me, the front door was open. Can I borrow some change? 

You haven't?

And let's make sure nobody gets a stupid hybrid, right? 

Yeah, we may not have gotten to ski earlier, but with this lift we'll get more runs in than anybody.

Oh God. Oh Jesus.

Everybody doesn't know. And why are you so ashamed of me?

Ahh. Ahhhahhahahahh.

All right, that does it! Come on, Kyle, I don't want you hanging around with these ignorant idiots! 

I couldn't stay away. Curse your rockin' tits!

Kyle...

Huh? 

Oh, is the game on or something? 

Incriminate.

on that show.

Are you doing okay?

...What?

He was the most upright and honorable of men, and every day he praised God. 

Kyle? What are you doing here?

What's going on down here?

It's... other-worldly.

Wait, here's 20. Get one for your brother, too. 

Yeah. See ya. 

Doing what?

What? Why??

Look out for your brother, Kyle. You're the man now.

Cats aren't the problem. We made cats illegal and and then I cheesed for the first time in ten years. And kids are always gonna find a new way to get high. Like sniffing glue or licking toads, or fermenting feces or huffing paint. You can also look at-

You know your brother watches MacNeil/Lehrer Report every night at ten!

Oh, Jesus. 

She's mine, you little asshole!

It is sick and disgusting, and we simply will not have it!

From Ireland.

All right, we did it!

Uh not this again.  Ike, we are sick of you talking about ghosts!

There! You have it! Straight from the horse's mouth!

What the hell are they doing now?!

Hey, come on. We should take a tour of the Smithsonian before we head back.

Hey, my son is just discovering love. Maybe your daughter is, too. They-uh, they need to know about that stuff.

Kyle, that's not the issue right now.

The answer is no, Kyle!

Listen to you. You're yelling at me; you've never yelled at me before.

But it's time for you to get back to school and on with your lives.

Well where the hell am I supposed to go to the bathroom? I I need a large tank with salt water.

Hey, Randy, what's up?

The flagpole! That's great! 

Okay, there's another one.  Aw, man! Look at that!  Can you believe this?! An SUV with a V8 engine, makes me sick!  "Ticket for driving a gas-guzzler"

Jesus! Look at us! We all don't like the Wall-Mart, but we can't stop coming here.

Yes, I can tell.

Sheila, could you pass me the dead fetus?  I mean, gravy.  Ow!

AAAGGGHH!!!

There you are, Kyle. I was gonna see if you and your brother wanted to go down to the bowling alley.

Yes that's right. We're the Broflovskis.

It wasn't our idea to take out Santa Claus! 

Being smug is a good thing. 

Eh, neither did we.

So we're friends again?

Well, screw you guys! 

Hm... Good point; here's $10. 

You can't do this alone!

Change?  Hello? Do you have any change?

Courtney Cox, I love you.  
You're so hot  on that show.

Which cartoon is it? What cartoon'll be so insensitive as to have Mohammad as a character?

Mm-hmm. 

Well, because they're the ones that let this harassment go on. And, they have a lot more money. I think we could get a lot more out of this than half of Stan's belongings.

Yes?

Can I come with you?

Right right, w-would, would you like red or white wine?

Ha ha ha ha ha! Ooh-ho boy, have you got a lot to learn! Sit down, son.  You see, Kyle, we humans work as a society, and in order for a society to thrive, we need gods, and clods.

Hey now, let him go! 

Because we're your parents!

That's it. I'm destitute.  Loan me money! You've gotta have money in the cup!  Wha- what's in the cup?

Jimbo, your truck probably gets less than ten miles to the gallon.

And so, in summation, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you've heard the version of my client's song recorded over twenty years ago. You've heard the exact same song produced by those cheats in the past month. I'd say it's pretty much an open-and-shut case. Make the right decision. Thank you.  We've got 'em. 

Look, I'm just trying to make the people of South Park aware of a very serious problem.

Now, you go brush your teeth and march into bed!  You won't be opening your Channukah present tonight!

It's okay, Kyle. Just... be a good boy.

No Internet... anywhere...

What's "grab ass?"

Okay, I'm done.

You see, Kyle, we live in a liberal, democratic society. And Democrats make sexual harassment laws. These laws tell us what we can and can't say in the workplace. And what we can and can't do in the workplace.

NO, no, uh I don't think so.

Oh. Sure. 

Yeah. I'm down twenty-six thousand.

Oh we're so sorry, Jared

It's alright, he couldn't have gone far. Let's call the other kids' houses. 

Yeah! We could have the boys do their presentation as part of our peace rally on Saturday!

Oh, you heard him, Sheila! Kyle wants to leave! Our nice old house doesn't interest Kyle anymore! Well I'm calling the moving company right now! 

Oh yeah, yeah, the kids were pretty excited.

No. Does it really matter?

More schnapps! 

Yeah.

Make me a... dolphin? 

Just like you deceived our son into going to Kenny's; and that didn't work either!

Yeah. Come along, Kyle 

Here- here you go. And and don't go to the store down the block. The one four miles away in Fairplay has better pretzels.
