Either this chick is a dude or Halpert got scared straight!
I tell you what though, since my move down to Florida I've really gotten back into hunting big time.
Special delivery!
That's great.
I can do it.
Quick query, Halpert.
Wait, I just got it from somebody else. Wow. This is hot. Damn! How do I get you out of this picture?
You took the ice queen? I don't buy it.
Yup. Tallahassee, let's go.
Did you say 'masturbator?'
Cookies. Bet you anything it���s cookies.
Totally. I mean, I'd never bang an animal, you can hardly tell the difference between a boy or a girl, you know, but hunting's intense.
Big whoop! I was in Hot-lanta. That whole town is whacked.
I'll be there at 6:00
What happened?
Shut it!
Sit on the throne, Michael.
Jason Bourne would kick Bond's ass.
I will be here.
Mike, okay, a stripper is bachelor party 101.  If you don't get a stripper your party is going to suck it hard.
Shut up!
Aaaaand he host at his own lame game.
I have a full day of sales calls.
[laughs uproariously]
Oh, yikes. Incoming- [tries to touch the wound]
Alright.
That was an interesting diversion. Shall we get back to the meeting?
Not good enough (clicks tongue)
-features a tech support area. Bring in your product, a bunch of nerdy virgins fix it on the spot. Huge for building loyalty.
This is great. This is gonna be great.
What? That's a joke, right? You see the way she's all over me.
Okay, drinking game. Count of three, take three sips.
No.
You didn't order a stripper?  Have you ever even been to a bachelor party?
Well, no. I got nothing.
And what kind of stripper did you get?
Thank you.
They wouldn't give you a subscription to Maxim.
Halpert!  Tall, queer, handsome as ever.  Hey everybody it's me, Jim.  Hello, hello.  Todd Packer.
Yeah.
[Breaks pencil.]
Yeah, Mike, still nothing.
Quick somebody help!  Help the man! [Pretends to kick Michael]
Your mom, you gay nerd!
Dude, don't you yak on me. This shirt is Van Heusen.
Left it in the middle of your office.
You can't put me down. Too strong!
Oh, please, You're through. She's going to give it to me as I'm giving it to her tonight. The cowgirl has chosen her saddle. [clicks tongue, whinnies]
Drama queen, am I right?
