Well, why did you pull it out of the trash?
Dude, my brother's in Milan. There's nothing I can do.
How are you rich?! Your mom pays for everything!
Yeah. He was doing their voices and pouring tea for them.
No! No God damn it no! I'm telling you you're wrong! There, there's no way I can have HIV! Unless maybe...  Oh my God. That son of a bitch! 
How about we revamp the name? Super School News sounds dry.
It's the holiday season, but the good times... are ending.Because what matters most isn't what's good, it's what's trending.
This younger generation, with their eyes and ears glued:
What's trending to them is trenders who trend on YouTube.
The Jewish population isn't dying out, fatass! It's growing!
What? Y-you gotta vote, dude. Haven't you seen the Rock the Vote stuff or, or Puff Daddy's Vote or Die?!
You're watching someone play Call Of Duty and talk about it?
Cartman, Cartman! I heard that Stan somehow found out about our plan!
I know! But that doesn't matter any more! These kids don't wanna play the game, they just wanna watch people on YouTube play it. And you know why? Commentary.
...Yeah. Or we could just show our asses.
It's not lame, it's sweet! After we build this clubhouse, we're gonna get girls to play Truth or Dare!
This is it, Stan. If you strike this kid out, we all get to go home.
Jambu! Jambu, I'm back!  How are you feeling?  Huhm. Jambu, you wanna talk about rocket ships?  Ja- Jambu? Are you still feelin' lonely here?
Huuh, I wah... just ah... well... that's all. 
We need to genetically engineer our pig and an elephant, but their genes won't splice.
Hey you guys! Check out my sweet Chinpokomon doll!
'Cause, r-tard, he's Stan from the future. He knows everything Stan knows.
Just stop it!  Stoop iiit!!  There's a logical explanation for that.
Get out of here, you piece of garbage! You wanna smoosh, go creepin' somewheres else!
I don't have a choice, dude. I'm gonna swallow my pride, face Cartman, and say "Congratulations. You were right" And I'm gonna give him the ten dollars. And hopefully, he won't make a big deal out of it.
I don't know.  Oh, great. He's got that stupid beard on again.
Why did you go and have to be abducted, Tweek? Now all our parents are freaking out!
Dude! I aced that test! I'm gonna win that dinner with Ms. Ellen!
It's just that... I really need this A, Stan. And Bebe did say you almost broke your last egg.
You mean everyone has been wanting Britney Spears to kill herself?
When we said "documentary," I thought we meant 60 Minutes, not Honey Boo Boo!
Well I've been thinking: maybe there's something you've come into contact with that hinders HIV from growing. Do you mind if we just look around?
Well uh, he'll have to do. Cartman has to get some practice with a real bull.
You put a guy's wiener in your mouth, that makes you gay, stupid!
But before he could go through with this entire plan, he discovered that the pie had already been eaten...  ...by your dog. 
I left my wife today. Walked out of the apartment without saying a word. I ran away from my responsibilities... just like I always do.  And I, again, am alone. 
But that sucks. I don't want something to have that much power over me.
Hey Token.  You-you gonna watch the game tonight, Butters? 
Dude, why is your store called "The Indian Burial Ground Pet Store?"
Butters! When did you call Oculus Rift Customer Service?!
No, I'm serious. What is that behind you?
Oh, so the gallant knight now comes to rescue me from the bowels of mediocrity! Oh, thank you, your royal lordship! 
Well, he has this new teacher's assistant, and uh and they're both... totally gay.
Yeah, the High Elf. He'll know what to do. 
We can't. We're saving our money for the balls in Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth game.
Aah I think you'd rather hear this in private!
Wow! I guess reading really does suck ass!
I promised my mom I'd let him try. 
Dude, he's not gonna swing! So just throw balls. That way he'll have to walk to first base. 
Man. Cartman's more screwed up than I thought.
Yeah. I hope he makes his Salisbury steak with buttered noodles! 
Yeah. And I can still get my A!
You aren't gonna cut off his wee wee. Not today, you sick-ass weirdo!
Well, we tried, dude. If anyone else in this craphole hates Americans, we'd better just leave the goat and get back to the plane!
Boy, that really did the trick, Stan. I thought we were kind of, sort of, not really done for.
Yes, people can get hurt. That's how terrorism works. But if you give into that, Doug, you're allowing terrorism to work. Do the right thing here.
I think he wants us to get in.
I- I can't do it... I can't do it. I...
From who? We can't ask adults for help and there's nobody tougher than sixth graders.
All right, it's decided. Let's all write in "Giant Douche."
Now, don't go saying that. There's always hope. Miracles happen most every day.
To people like you, and me.
But don't expect a miracle.
Unless you help make it to be.
You hope, and I'll hurry.
You pray, and I'll plan
We'll do what's necessary, 'cause
Even a miracle needs a hand!
We couldn't get trapped here forever, Cartman. We'd die after a couple of days. 
We know. Believe me, we know. We're reminded every day that you're not Kenny because Kenny... was cool.
You guys! You guys! I have awesome news!
Comments on commentators, it's all changing so fast.Playing XBox with your brother is... just a thing of the past.
Now with Ma on her iPad, and Dad trending or trying,All the family is scattered, and the living room's dying.
Because it wasn't the outdoors or church or even trips to go ski,
What brought families together most was a good old TV
Now we watch things by ourselves and just tweet what we saw.
And if you try to complain, you get called a-
Are you guys having a meeting or something?
Yeah, hey, do you think we'll get in trouble for watching it?
You got Randy Newman to do the theme song. You're not trying that hard. Token, you're a good kid. How can you sit there and collect money on a show that's about a, about a fat child killing himself?? Where's your sense of shame??
Dude, we have to get to the mall!!
"Get ready", "answer the door", Jesus Christ, make up your friggin' mind! 
But they said we can't charge the front door.
Hi, we'd like to speak to a  Professor Teabag? 
Please? I need you to come sit down for a second.  So... Here we all are. Mom, do you want to tell Dad something?  Mom?
No thanks. We're trying to unbrainwash our friend.
Yeah, dude! Kenny just died eight hours ago from that monster! How could he have died back then, too?
Yeah. I guess that's the point. I don't think we're gonna understand. Maybe this IS all the beginning of a new art form. YouTube celebrities are only getting bigger. And what's great is that these people are inventing themselves, instead of being marketed and shoved down our throats.
I don't know. Do you know where he is, Marvin? 
Let's just get this over with, Cartman. You won the bet, here's ten dollars.
But I'm gonna be Royal Crown Chinpokomon Master!
Ah, I told you we shouldn't have brought him to school dude.
All right dude, what the hell has gotten into you?! I don't trust for one second that your sudden concern for the Muslim people is real!
Wendy, nothing's gonna happen to the egg. You can have it when the week is over and I have my grade.  Freakin' weirdos, man.
The author meant to be as gross as possible because it was funny!
Date-rape something. Yeah. Okay. I will. Okay, thanks, Mon.  I don't have to go outside!
Who the hell reads that entire thing every time it pops up?
Dude, you have to tell everyone. Right now.
Alright, alright, let's get this over with so we can put her back!
You son of a bitch.  You didn't solve your homeless problem, you just sent all your homeless to South Park! 
But you accepted money from the Canadian government! To push a freemium game on us! Why would they do that?!
Yeah. We're gonna call you Fartboy from now on.
On Skippy, on Rainbow, on Patches, on Montel. 
I'm not cheesing. I've never cheesed once in my life.
Oh that's,  yeah that's good, that's good. Alright, chapter... one...
This is our shot at making it into the WWE. To be real wrestlers. 
Can you act like you're giving him a lot?
All right, all right!  Dude, what is the matter with you?
What's this about you going on live television on Saturday?!
Dude! I'm glad to see you. You would not believe the night I had.
Butters was supposed to go with us to Casa Bonita tonight.
I mean, what if I'm just part of my parents' reality?
Cartman, you only come to soccer practice on Fridays, and that's only because we have Kentucky Fried Chicken afterwards!
If you want your share of the money, then you're gonna shovel snow like the rest of us!
I know, but—why do they have to take it out on us? Why do we have to wait around for them to come back?
I'm gonna buy a Walkman with my half.
Can you imagine it, Stan. A mind, emptied by that... thing.
No dude. Because since you got your feelings so hurt for being ripped on, now we think you're a pussy.
Damnit!  Tell me what to do, Willzy-x! How do we get you home??
I don't know about this, guys. I think sleds are dangerous.
Well, all I can say is, he's better have Nintendo.  Well, here's Kenny's house.
But how are we gonna get to the North Pole?
It's no use. There's nobody around for miles.
Yeah. Look what he did to our friend, Kenny.
I-Ike, this is a big deal. You have to be absolutely, 100%-
You know, I heard our fourth-grade teacher is some new lady from Denver.
Well, so then WWE will recruit us and not them.
Twenty-five cents? Well that's not even worth it.
That's not being nice! That's just putting on a nice sweater!
Hey! Maybe we should ask the girls what they learned in sex ed.
Yeah, dude. Your mom wanted you to have herpes on your face.
Dude, I just got an IM from Stan that they evacuated the school.
What am I going to do? My little brother's been abducted by aliens.  You farted. 
Hello. There are certain networks that we see as harmful to our families, and we want them removed, please.
Yeah. And you know, now that I think about it, third grade wasn't all that great, either.
Damnit! What the hell is wrong with you, Tweek?!
Yeah. We've been playing with firecrackers our whole lives.
You just wanna lock me in there because you think I'm one of them.
Yeah.  Hey Riley! Try this hamburger.  Cartman made them himself.
Yes, I know that! Why do you think I've been putting up with his farts?!
Yeah. Clearly Annie Nelson is the hottest girl at our school. Look at those eyes!
It says right there "a parent has to be with you to sign up," and you'll never get your mom to agree to something so horrible, so ha! 
We don't know where Cartman is, Ms. Choksondik!
Uhn, you don't understand! My friend is in Imaginationland! I can hear him in my head!
Yeah, you can have a drink of water. The dispenser's over there. 
Now look, Butters, when the girls bring out the future-telling device, pay attention to how it works. Once you know how to operate it, just grab it and get the hell out of there.
This is ridiculous! Just because they say it on TV it's alright.
Yeah. You used to sit in the living room with family and friends to hear their commentary on things. Now you can get it with a little guy in a window on the screen. Someone who just comments on stuff. I mean, really? Who would even WANT to do that?! 
But why not? You said sometimes people need surgery to make them feel better about themselves.
It's what we do in Jew Scouts. Usually we just sit around and make stuff. But tonight, because there's a meteor shower, we're gonna do some big thing out in the woods. It's gonna suck ass, I'm sure.
Excuse me, this isn't exactly what I had in mind!
Yeah. I think Phil Collins rocks the house.
I'm just not sure this is the name people are gonna give money to.
That thing is pretty cool. What games did you get with it?
Oh my God! I killed Kenny! You bastard!
Dad, can we go home? All you ever do since you got this car is drive around and show it off! 
Me?? Dude, I've been here since the beginning!
What part of being infected with a deadly disease do you find funny?!
I know Cartman made it all up, okay?! I also know that nothing is more important for humanity than peace in the Middle East! I'm okay with this, Stan!
You aren't gonna get away with this you stupid asshole! 
Whoa, hang on! We shouldn't be learning how not to get caught. We have to take responsibility for our actions. 
We didn't think that by pretending you didn't exist, you would really change, but you really have.
That system is totally screwed up and does nothing but wreak havoc!
What?! Timmy! You've got to get off that chair!
It's okay. You don't have to feel alone anymore. 
All this for a bunch of stupid movies?
Dude, we've gotta hurry home! The final episode of Lost is on soon. 
You mean that we're forced to pay for the Oprah channel?
That quest sucks, Cartman! Think of another one!
You might as well just say Pilgrims and Indians were all aliens who came here and made some kind of intergalactic treaty!
Dude! Just 'cause some stupid North Park kid blew his hands off, we don't get to buy M-80s?
It's not Helen Hunt's ass. It's an alien space ship.
Dude, if my mom knew I was in here, I would be in super big trouble.
I think we can do it, Stan. I've been close to a million a few times by myself.
This is where we all stand in a circle and pray to Moses for guidance during Jewbilee.
You're gonna give up on Faith Hilling just like that, Butters? How could you?
Dude, what are you talkin' about? That was awesome!
We have reached the Great Pass of Mount Ururalak.
But you're lying to people. If they knew that you didn't eat just all the sandwiches you want, you might not be so popular.
I've had enough of the Bible. What has it gotten me?
A hundred thousand for a picture of Britney peeing on a ladybug. Imagine what a photo of her crapping on a squirrel is worth!
I got some sound advice... from an old friend. 
Well, maybe Mr. Garrison is wrong. You should ask somebody else.
Look, we're just trying to show you there's other girls out there.
Yeah, you can't get it if you don't breathe.
We're already doing a paper on Tweek's underpants gnomes.
No he didn't kill him, he's still breathing!  Get up!  Get UP! 
Oh no! They ruined my life! I get to kill them first!
Terrible. Every time I close my eyes I see the house we TP'ed. I see the tears of our art teacher and hear the screams of her daughters.
Dude, you said you wouldn't say everything looked like shit!
Hey you guys! You guys are not gonna believe this!
What do you mean? We're learning all kinds of cool stuff.
We've gotta do something, Chef. If we don't we don't stop that network,  "shit" will become an even more acceptable word!
Craig, we have chosen you to join our Peruvian flute band!
But this video game can make a million dollars. We have to give the crack babies a piece of that.
Until we get people to stop downloading music for free, I say we refuse to play!
Well, we've got something to tell you about Veronica, Chef!
And do I have to shovel the whole driveway, or just the side the car is on?
I mean, I do, but, well, ever since I became friends with that Kip Drordy kid, a bunch of my other friends have started ignoring me. It would be fine except for my farm is starting to shrink. I know that I should just dump Kip as a friend, but that's such a terrible thing to do and, I'm sorry I'm just so confused I... I really need a friend right now.
I don't know about this guys. I think playing hide and seek in the airport might be dangerous.
...And if you look here, you can see how David Blaine performed the miracle of being frozen in ice at Times Square.
Yeah, he wanted adventure! Not a bunch of ridiculous bullcrap! Right Chef?  Chef?
They're cells that come from fetuses, and some research show that they could be used to treat diseases.
City of Brentwood
They take really good care
of all their homeless
Maybe we should get out first. See if we can find a way out and then come back for him.
Alright, ahhh, why don't we do something else?
Kinda like Cartman's dad shipped out on him.
Please, tune in and help get America's families back in the living room.
Look, Stan. When Kenny died I learned how important friends are. I'm not gonna lose another friend.
Yeah, it was the craziest thing. I hid myself on a plane to Antarctica. Oh, it was so dry down there.
I have to show you something.  I think it will change the way you feel about your impact here.
Hey, look. The aliens are getting ice cream.
Cartman, you're supposed to be studying! What the hell is all this?!
I don't want to ask Mr. Hat, I'm asking you!
But... we were so close... I'm sorry, Willzy-x. We tried.
Yeah. Well, she likes Ike a whole lot.
What the hell is wrong? "Can't find the server" Kickstarter. 
Yeah. If we're Jewish, are we gonna go to hell?
How the hell do you have more friends than me?
Yeah. It just proves we need to learn not to profile one race of people. Because, actually, most of the world hates us.
All right, all right, I was not responsible for 9/11!  God-damnit!
Yeah. And now you can take that stupid beard off! 
Dude, he must be loaded! What does he do?
Trent Boyett is being released from Juvenile Hall.
God damn it this is serious, you guys! Cartman has stolen the election!
Yeah, you're cool. And you don't say "hella."
Mr. Garrison, we've been watching Barnaby Jones repeats for eight days now. It's hard to keep paying attention.
Yeah, but maybe we need a name that's more affirming, like, shows what we stand for.
Cartman, uh, all I was trying to tell you at Wall-Mart was that you-
Stan, you can't keep doing this to yourself. You have to go live.
Mom, Dad, can I have money to buy Chinpokomon?
You know what's goin' on. It's Smackdown tonight. Which means we might have to fight each other.
God-dammit. Come on, guys. We gotta go to Butters' house.
Just make sweet love down by the fire.
We need some help identifying an ancient English stone.
...Yeah, and dressing up and running around at night is faggy anyway.
"Wanted by U.S. Border Patrol"?! "Permission to shoot on sight"?!
Dude! Where have you been? I've been waiting all afternoon.
Dude, totally. With Kenny's Magic skills, we could probably kick serious ass!
Don't be sad, Ike. Just be happy that you live in a country where people get to elect a president at all.  Hello?
Check it out, dude. The camera shoots one frame at a time. So, all we gotta do, is put the right mouth on, according to what syllable they're pronouncing at that frame.
THIS is the reason why our living rooms are dying!
I have to watch out for my glasses. Ow! Ow, it's so cold! Oh Jesus! 
Please, just, just leave it alone, Stan. Everything is as it has to be.
Ask Jeeves? Nobody uses Ask Jeeves! Just Google-search it!
Well, he screwed us by makin' something up; I say we do the same thing.
Wow, dude, check it out! We can win Terrance and Phillip dolls. 
Nah, I can't. We should help look for him.
So then, she's gonna be seeing other people? Is she, sort of, available?
I can't wait to see him!  He's gonna be so glad we came!
Hey Stan. Dude, I want you to have this. It's the twenty bucks I owed you plus thirty dollars interest.
We don't have a choice, dude. That guy killed our characters 14 times.
Hey Cartman, I need to talk to you.
God damn it! I don't want him to jump over more a-
Get the hell off me! You're a freak, Butters! You can't play with us!
You, you paid your friends tuh...  not make fun of me?
It didn't work! My stupid Jew dad won't lend me money for CDs!
Well, our pig hasn't given birth yet, but she should anytime now.
Dude, we'll have Chef's $2 million in no time!
We're all here today because Chef has been such an important part of our lives. A lot of us don't agree with the choices Chef has made in the past few days.  Some of us... feel hurt... and confused that he seemed to turn his back on us.  But we can't let the events of the last week take away the memories of how much Chef made us smile.  I'm gonna remember Chef as the jolly old guy who always broke into song.  I'm gonna remember Chef... as the guy who gave us advice to live by.  So you see, we shouldn't be mad at Chef for leaving us. We should be mad at that little fruity club for scrambling his brains.
Because I m-I mean I really think you could have done it for about $12.50.
No, my little brother's been abducted by aliens.  It's true! Ask Cartman, they gave him an anal probe.
It's not stupid, Stan. For once in my life I feel like I'm part of something.
Ha, Goddamnit!  Haaa. Ohhhh. Ahh, ohh, uhh, agh, 
I didn't see you complaining at the time, fat boy!
No it's not, Cartman. You know, there really are couples out there who are missing children.
No! What we really should do is go to our parents right now and take responsibility for smoking ourselves. Even if it means getting grounded.
Noo, I'll just... be... going back to bed now.
Don't worry, dude. That little truck just runs on D batteries. It's gonna run out of juice soon. 
You guys, we can't give up on our dreams now! As soon as this strike ends, we're gonna be the biggest band ever!
Why didn't you tell me, Stam? I would've helped.
But that's stupid.  How can that replace Faith Hilling? It doesn't even make any sense.
Did you play the Terrance & Phillip freemium game all day?
We won't let it happen again, Mr. Mackey, m'kay? 
Okay, fine, I will!  H-wait a minute! I don't even want one copy of Time Cop! 
Alright guys, do you think he's lying or telling the truth?
What uh, what are you supposed to be?
It's this place called Des Moines. It's like, lost in time, see?  Everybody looks like you do.  Fashion is two years behind, Technology is two years behind, fads, are two years behind, just like you. 
It always has been. See? This is nice. 
Look, let's just get our money from EA Sports and get out of this whole thing once and for all!
Wait... stop it, stop it!  I can't let Kenny be sock-dried.
We're not gonna hurt her, we just need some of her blood.
Uh, hi. Our friend joined your club a while back, and now he wants to molest kids. 
Ladies and gentlemen, we have an epidemic in our country. Obesity is costing taxpayers millions, and some are taking advantage of a system that is flawed. Over the past several days I have filmed such a case, and the shocking video has been edited by my partner, Token. It is our hope that this film will cast light on a serious issue. 
No, don't you see? Cartman never had psychic visions. And neither do these people. The plain simple truth is that nobody is psychic. There's a logical explanation for every psychic story you've ever heard.
Okay, okay. Stan, you're right. Maybe I let being a martyr go to my head. Just please, let me stay on this path, and, I'll try to be cool about it. Okay? I'm sorry.
Stan...  Do you really think my hat is stupid?
Can't we just play hide and seek at home?
Yeah, let's watch Yo Gabba Gabba, like old times.
So I guess this means we get to keep our weapons.
It means Jehovah is going to use his powers to keep the Pharaoh from letting us go.
It was just thirty minutes of two women queefing on people!
Come on, dude, somebody needs to wipe that fuckin' smirk off his face!
Um I think we're just heading deeper into the mountains.
This is ridiculous! Are we really going to go out there and play North Park like this?!
That can't be. My parents wouldn't lie to me.
We have to speed this up!  Uh, can we collect our Internet money in front of you, please?
That can't be true! My parents wouldn't do that!
You don't understand what my mom will do to me if she finds out I was playing with weapons!
Well, Stan I have to harvest my crops before it's too late.
Guys! You guys!  Listen: Cartman has tens of thousands of voter ballots hidden somewhere. He's changed the outcome of the election!
Yeah, this is starting to look like something we shouldn't be any part of. Let's go play with trucks or something. 
Yeah. Come on, Dad, this place sucks. I wanna go.
Well, let's see how he likes the icy blasts from my nunchucks of Sokuromoto! 
Well, I guess it's mostly the way Mr. Garrison stuck a gerbil up Mr. Slave's ass.
Fine! But when you're naked and jackin' it in San Diego, don't ask me for help! 
A-ah! A-a-ah! Wha? Where...? Oh. Oh dude. Oh, it was just a dream. It was all just a crazy dream. Huh, oh my God. 
When an artist creates, whatever they create belongs to society
Okay. Okay, the shot is finally set up. Now shoot the O mouth for two frames. 
How come the visitors aren't coming for him?
What did they do with all the fat? There must have been enough to last an Eskimo family months.
Then I was right. Job has all his children killed, and Michael Bay gets to keep making movies. There isn't a God.
There are greater things at work than what you understand.
You... bastards!  Wha, what the hell is wrong with you?? What kind of Prime Minister bases his decisions on hatred?  And, and takes away mounties' horses?  And French people's wine? What the hell kind of Prime Minister are you, anyway?!
You son of a bitch! I won't let you win! You hear me?!
I know it's hard to believe, but you have to trust me.
Why did they search us? That marijawana never even made it to us.
We'll get back in time for a Christmas adventure.
No, Cartman, we can't do it on Raymond again! It has to be on a current event in South Park. Tweek, do you have any ideas?
Hey, how do we know if she's pregnant?
It was Cartman having Butters apologize for him.
Ike, jump down, now! For the love of God, Ike, jump!
I was in the bathroom when you were talking to Butters, Cartman!  I know what-
That's the most horrible story I've ever heard. Why would God do such a horrible thing to a good person just to prove a point to Satan?
You know what I mean! Why is my little brother watching you talking about us talking about him?!
You don't know what you're talking about, fatass!
Why do they have to put this on TV?! 
You guys, maybe we should come clean right now and tell everyone that it wasn't the tobacco companies that made us want to smoke.
Dude, we have to get rid of our weapons so at least we can try to deny everything.
We believe that films are pieces of art that must be preserved from the perverse hands of their agent filmmakers..
This is the worst day of my life.
Because we keep getting screwed over by your diarrhea!
It just ran by here a second ago. 
Excuse me, what are you doing to my locker?!
I'm going to see the Queer Eye For the Straight Guy people.
Heeey Ike! Look what I got.  The new Call Of Duty! Do you wanna go downstairs and play?
The-that's not the right way to look at it, I-
Okay, fine. You know what? Let's just get it over with!
Ah, heck, Mr. Visitors, I'm just a kid all alone in this crazy world, but if you could find it in your hearts or whatever you have, to give my brother back to me, it sure would make my life brighter again.
Uh, yeah! I agree! Uh- my fragile little eight-year-old mind didn't know how to deal with what I was seeing. C-Cartman should be punished!
That's not what she said. You're putting extras on again. It's not that funny.
This part kinda sucks, Kenny, but don't screw it up. 
Why?! So I could be sitting in the hospital waiting to die, like Stan?!
Oh my God, you're right! You're totally right!! EVERYONE! GET A NEW TREND GOING! FAST! #webelieveinyou!
Our main point is that the flag shouldn't offend anyone, because killing has been around since the beginning of time. All animals kill.  And the animals that don't kill are stupid ones, like cows and turtles and stuff. So people should not be so upset about killing. 
Haven't you noticed everyone getting sick? It all started when they said "shit" on television.
He's a magician named David Blaine, dude. He kicks ass.
Hey yeah! What's that song she always sings? There's got to be a morning after.
But it's not fair! We have to do a full report on the Founding Fathers, and Cartman got out of helping us again!
"What I Wanna Be When I Grow Up"?
What was it about? Ih-in case our teacher asks us.
'K, so then get on Facebook and fertilize my crops?
Don't you think you owe everyone an apology for bringing NAMBLA here?
W-well, 'cause we want all of those fags to get out of town.
Do you really think anything's gonna be any different now?!  Do you really think that this will have the tiniest, smallest effect on the world?  It's still the same old world out there. Look.  What the hell?
Yeah. And then Craig's family came on and said Tweek was the wuss, and then punched Tweek's mom in the hooters.
Cartman, you don't buy pubes, you grow them yourself!
Whoa Cartman. Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night.
Look, that was a long time ago. Maybe Trent Boyett has forgotten all about it.
L-look, I was just suggesting that maybe this one person could control what he said, but just didn't, for fun.
Uh alright, sorry kid. Gue- guess we have the wrong house.
Officer Barbrady, I wanna declare Shenanigans on this carnival operator.
Yep. But I guess this proves that war is the natural order of life.
Oh. We'll wait for you over there, Steve. We have to start fighting now.
The new neighbors that moved in next to Stan's house. Me and Ike saw the mom get a parking ticket, and she called the parking cop "muff cabbage".
But instead, we should all be treated the same, with the same laws and the same punishments for the same crimes . For in that way Cartman can be freed from prison, and we  will have a chance to win the sledding race on Thursday.
Cartman, you're such a fat ass that when you walk down the street people go "God damn it, that's a big fat ass!"
Dude, what the hell has gotten into Cartman??
We're, we're in trouble. We're in sooo much trouble.
Wait. I don't know if this is cool.
But we found a frozen ice man from the past! 
Eh I, I don't know what else to paint.
My name is Kyle Broflovski. My friend was raped last Memorial Day weekend. And, and I  I'm gonna help prosecute the men responsible.
Dreidel dreidel dreidel,
I made you out of clay,
Dreidel dreidel dreidel--
But I'll get snow on my gloves and then it will melt and I'll have wet hands.
Well, we got some cigarettes, but we don't think you should be smoking. Each year, over a million people die of smo-
Tattle-tale?! Do you know how serious this is?!
Hell no! I'm not being part of a four-member boy band! We'll look stupid!
You assholes stole our client! How about some Goddamn business ethics?!
We need to see the new Prime Minister.
Well, who really cares what that monster is outside? As long as we stay on the bus, it can't hurt us. Right? 
Look! It might be a coincidence, but I think we'd better ask someone. Come on! 
From now on, MOOP isn't about money. MOOP is about music! We're not striking anymore! Who's with us?! 
Another devastating loss for the Cows last night, Eric. They were ahead in the game until Kelly Anderson started crying because she missed her daddy, who's on a business trip in Thailand. Uh, Kelly was so upset she couldn't play, and the Cows had to forfeit.
I'm the whole solar system! The planets even all revolve the right way. That tub of candy is as good as mine!
Are you gonna take us somewhere or not?!
So what should we do now? It's Saturday and we have to have as much fun as possible.
Dude! Every time we play Americans vs. Bosnians, you cheat!
I won't believe it! I won't! I have to ask my mom and dad! 
Huh? Well we don't really have that much money.
This must be it. "Cleo Broflovski" That's my grandma. 
I'm sorry, Stan. I'm sorry. This whole war has just got us all so screwed up. I just want us to be playing Call of Duty on the right machine.
Yeah. But I have to say, I feel a lot better now.
There aren't gonna be new shows! Don't you get it?! Terrance and Phillip are Canadian! We have to get Canada to end this strike!
All right,  check it out, I-  Butters, BUTTERS. What the fuck?! Are you peeing in the pool?!
I hate being small and Jewish. I feel like a tall black man.
It's perfect! I could take her to a basketball game.  Man I I don't know what's happenin', but... it seems like all the girls are... kind of into me lately. 
Oh, bu- but isn't the cold air making the ball really hard? Ih-it's gonna hurt my hands.
Oh. Uh, can't right now, but maybe another time. See ya! 
Is it like a- haunted house or something?
You didn't think of anything, Butters! Guys have been doing what you're doing for years! You're nothin' but a common pimp! 
Okay, okay, you can have your powers back.
We got the money, Mr. Hankey. We're gonna make our animated Christmas card.
I can't do that, I'd just feel too bad.
An online chat party for all his friends... Dude, I should get over there!
No, dude, you don't wanna bring your people to Mexico, there's missionaries there, too.
Did you hear that, dude? We still get $3000. That's enough for you to do your DNA test.
No! It's alright! Just give me some time to work on them. I'll see you guys later. 
What the hell is that lady talking about?
You were sticking these in your ass, Cartman?!
Platform 4F. Uhhh, it must be on the other side of the station.
No, Cartman. You said nobody will have to be grounded. We're not playing dirty!
Goddamnit. We're gonna take a short break. Be back in five. 
It's that ring. Somehow, putting on that ring has turned Kenny into a boring turd.
Cartman got his, then Kenny. What if tomorrow Stan says he got his and I'm left out? I might not even get to be their friend anymore.
Yeah, but you're our new friend and that makes you cul.. p-piable!
Hey. Wuh I'm giving a speech tomorrow about people with red hair and freckles. Can I ask you a few questions?
I didn't suck his balls, all right?! And I'm not going to!
No, no, you... you wrote down Turd Sandwich.
Yeah! Next time you make up a word, don't make up one that already exists!
What do you mean, "can't"?! You made it work; just build us another one!
That's, that that's k-kind of what I was thinking.
Dude, shop class sucks. Maybe we should have taken home ec.
Judas Priest.  Wow! Downloading music for free is awesome! 
You'll never get a platinum album doing Christian rock, Cartman! It was a stupid idea then, and it's a stupid idea now!
But where have you been? Things aren't the same without you. Nobody seems to have the Christmas spirit.
Calm down, Tweek. There has to be a rational explanation.
Yeah, I think that parents only get so offended by television because the rely on it as a babysitter, and the sole educator of their kids.
"You know he can't think on his own, Kyle!" "Brush and floss, Kyle!" "Where has that finger been, Kyle?"
You won the bet. You were totally accurate about being able to crap out your mouth, and I've just been frustrated because I didn't think of it first. I want you to enjoy that money because... you really impressed me with your insight and... I'm... proud to have you as a friend.
How come the visitors aren't coming for him.
I think Stan might've been right. Anyway, I think it's going too far. I mean, if I kill myself, it's gonna make my family really sad.
Hold on everybody. This thing isn't even a-
How could we know she would... Aw we suck so hard.
No Ike! They're playing the trailer to the new Terrance & Phillip movie during the show, and we have to watch it! 
Hay! He's totally underage. She's taking advantage of him.
Well I don't know. You're just the only grownup we trust.
Why do you put them into people's asses? Are you planning some kind of alien takeover?
D-hude, this is gonna be so killer. They're all gonna get herpes!
Oh, so you know what mung means, hunh?
You too! Right now! #webelieveinyou! We've got to make him appear! 
If you really think every kid in America should see your anti-bullying movie, then why don't you put it on the Internet for free?!
Why are they doing us one at a time?
Will you stop with the underpants gnomes, Tweek?! We have to work here!  
But we can put our money together with the money you made whoring yourself to all the women. How much did you make?
Well, we just thought we'd let you know. See ya.
Wow, then you should get money for it!
Mr. Garrison, since haiku sucks so much ass, could we go to the planetarium again?
So wait, wait: Stan took a dump in the urinal and he contacted the conspiracy Web site? But the conspiracy site was run by the government?
Nah, my mom packed me a kosher lunch.
We... came to learn the facts about people with red hair, light skin and freckles.
Red Robin can be rented out, for wedding parties. If we all chip in we can pay for the deposit to have the wedding party there.
You're not supposed to rock, you're supposed to keep the beat!
Dude, you don't want your first kiss to be something you paid for. It's supposed to be special.
We can't let those sixth graders get their hands on this videotape.
Here's our cell phone, dude.  Will you call the police for us? 
When Kickstarter went down, many saw their startup projects die, but here at Washington Redskins, we saw opportunity. People still need a way to raise money for their stupid startup projects, and with the Redskins you can now go fund yourself.  And the idea is simple. You, the people, go out and raise all your own money, and give the Washington Redskins 5%.
I am not full of meecro- what? Look, the word "shit" first showed up in English in the 1340s, the same time as something called, "The Black Death".
Dude, we don't have time for your stupid jokes! We're gonna die!
You should care! This strike affects everybody, fatass!
Do you really think that beating up a handicapped kid is being nice? 
Somebody bet on you, Jesus. You said yourself that one person still had money on you.
How come you didn't buy any cards, Stan?
Dude, hold on! This is bullcrap! If they wanna live in our time, then they should learn our language!
Going to Afghanistan? Locked in a small space for 20 hours? How could things get any worse? 
Okay.  N-no, ah I don't want that much responsibility. Here, you hold on to it, Kenny. 
No! These don't belong to you! They belong to the people!
Nono, after we found Cartman, I put the headset on and then-
Principal Victoria, there's something you need to know! Cartman's Tourette's isn't real! He's faking!
Fun for children?! Fun for children?! Look at me, Dad! I don't even know what's real anymore! Weaaaah! 
Because we're not referring to gay people! You can be gay and not be a fag.
What has this world come to? Where people can just... take your Okama GameSphere.
He just doesn't wanna look like an idiot, so he wants everyone to think the strike was for something. Just, just give him anything!
I told you not to call my mom a bitch, Cartman!
Dude, you've been sitting at your locker crying since lunch break. Clearly, something's going on.
But our teacher, Mr. Garrison? He just had his penis made into a vagina. How come?
K... what if we cover his face with a paper bag?
I'll kill you, Triceratops! You made fun of my crippled mother!
Hey!  Faith Hilling is not out of style, alright?
All you need to know is I'm way awesomer than you think, okay?!
If it needs to be seen by everybody, then why don't you put it out on the Internet for free?!  Well?!
Don't hurt anybody, sir. We could try and fix this.
Don't worry, Ike! The strike will be over soon! 
No, we really want nothing more to do with these people.
Okay, Marvin. Time to take your people to their new home!
Did you eat too many pork rinds last night? 
Oh, we're just makin' a cradle out of an egg carton for our egg. We figure that way it'll be easier to keep safe so we can get an A.
Maybe the problem is we don't have very good stories to report on.
You guys, that's not cool. These people have nowhere to go.  They don't have food or shelter. We have to do something.
Is that what you learned in sex ed?
You didn't see a leprechaun, fatass! If you could prove it, I had to suck your balls, but if you couldn't, you had to pay me ten dollars! Pay up!
Well, what about those two college guys next door to me? They're always doing science experiments in their basement.
No, we don't want to enter any of your stupid shelter!
Dude, asshole, you're keeping a lot of other celebrities in purgatory!
Hi. My name's Kyle. Uh, I understand that your country flies people into space for money.
Don't worry, guys. I'm getting a nurection as we speak.
No. We can't, dude. We have to win the Terrance and Phillip dolls.
And Cartman for having a whore for a mom.
There. Do you really want that asshole to win?
Wait. The U.S. Government has a portal to the imagination?
Hey. Do you ever think maybe you shouldn't give your son coffee?
Hey man, if you're Jewish you get presents for eight days.
Okay, I got a text of the Russian guy's podcast. It's all a bunch of links to eBay.
Give me the drum, and you play the flute.
Well, I just found out I'm a sex addict. I'm so scared, I haven't even told my mom yet.
I'm going to put it in my room, where Cartman can't find it.
Kenny's not really my friend, Ma. I don't give a rat's ass about him.
I'm sorry. You must've been worried sick. I got your sled tangled up with a bus. 
Goddamnit, you know I don't carry gold in a little bag around my neck, Cartman! Whattaya want from me?!
Guantanamo Bay?! We can't go to Guantanamo Bay!
Uh. My adopted brother got taken back here to Canada? So, we want to talk to the new Canadian Prime Minister about getting him back?
Dude, that new kid is such a douche!
Oh, Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay.
He was with us at dinner. Wait. Was he with us at dinner?
It just seems so unfair. People won't ever even know that the wrong man is in the White House.
Yeah, dude. I told you, we had bread sandwiches for breakfast.
Yeah. Too bad you're such a dumbass in history, or you would have known that!
That's right, we've still got Lorde. You talked to your dad, right Stan?
Mom, Dad, what exactly are this party for?
You're gonna need to kick more ass than that to beat the Cowboys.
Look, we're from Colorado! We, we grew up in the United States.
Come on, Steve, you're going to Des Moines!
Please, sir. I came because I don't think Ike belongs here. Family isn't about whose blood you have in you, family is about the people who cared about you and took care of you. We're not the same blood, but I love my little brother. We've taken care of him because he needed us to, and that makes us more family than anything. 
Maybe they should project the movies on Cartman's ass. 
That is the dumbest idea you guys have ever come up with! I'd expect this stupidity out of Cartman, but you, Stan?! Butters needs medical attention right now!
Are you serious?? Look around: doesn't this bother you at all??  That's YOU one day, fatass! Not even one day! If you don't change something, that's you! In about a year! 
See? Look at this. Ike has all his friends over and they're just sitting around on their own computers barely talking to each other. Ike is watching PewDiePie play Dragon Age.
Dude, you're just jealous because I'm Chinpoko Master!
Guys, Ike has gotten worse. I'm really worried about him. He says he's still seeing dead celebrities.
We're here dude. Just a little further and we can finally end this.
All right.  All right, I guess it's possible.
Buy me out?! What are you saying?! What makes you so high and mighty you can buy me out?!
Ha! Our bet was that you would get a platinum album, not a myrrh album! I don't owe you anything, fat boy!
But David Blaine is gonna do more miracles in Denver tomorrow..
But I can't, because, what if thinking about it is the only thing keeping my space-time together? 
Come on, Stan! Just strike this kid out so we can end the season! 
Do you think they're gonna pissed at us for lying that they molested us and sending them all to jail for ten days?
Well, I mean, you didn't just start at 40, didja? You you gotta low-ball these things so you have a place to go.
I dunno. I just have this sudden urge to go back.
Come on. Let's go see how Cartman is doing with his uh, urection.
Because, retard, you're dumb enough to buy Scott Tenorman's pubes for ten dollars!
Dude, where is she gonna get fetus clothes?
Hey dude, people are kind of pissed off at you.
Okay. Okay, you're right.  Oh uh Cartman: thanks.  Cartman?  What the hell? 
How do we make three hundred thousand dollars doing that?
They picked up my hash tag, Stan! I'm trending!
They're evil! I WISH I DIDN'T HAVE ANY PARENTS!
Fuck you! Why would they send you in to convince me of anything?!
Well then,  you've got to call the jail right now and tell them that you forgive Cartman for being a dumbass!
Ju-just have a little compassion, huh? I mean, everyone's gone out and bought something stupid. It's not so bad. Whichever of you guys has never bought anything frivolous, go ahead and huck the next squirrel. 
I... because the world is at peace. I must endure.
They were wearing cowboy hats!  Did you see??  Did you see?? 
Look, we could we could probably get Terrance, but he'll be performing with this other guy.
Because, he kinda like looks like Steve Austin, the $6 million man
Then don't belittle my people you fuckin' fatass!
"No, please! I promise I'll never make another album or movie!"
This would have never happened if you would have let Kenny be a princess in the first place!
Yeah... You know, it seems like something's still not right. 
You better! 'Cause if you don't find a cure for HIV, I will break your Xbox!
I can't just hide my whole life, Butters. And besides, I have this strange feeling that one of you is gonna totally betray me. 
Hello. I'm Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States.
I got a job, Stan. I am making tons of money doing some really cool stuff.
Well? Are you happy, Cartman? Butters is completely traumatized!
Chr, what could you possibly have in your room that could change the outcome of the election? 
Dude, I don't wanna see a bunch of guys' penises!
Ahh-d, excuse me, sir, did I hear you say you needed somebody for your show?
Here, give me that.  "I am Bumbly Wumbly. I live in the pond."
You were right. You were right all along. I thought you were just an asshole when you ripped on Jews, but... I didn't know, I... I didn't know.
I don't think it's gonna be that hard to keep it from breaking. This whole assignment is stupid.
Uh. All I did was show her how to-
Really? Great! I don't have to worry about that anymore. 
Nah, dude. Are you on America's side, Stan? 
We can get everyone back into the Christmas spirit by making our very own animated Christmas special, and showing it to everybody in town! 
He's just... changing a lot. He walks around angry, telling me I'm stupid and, and all he talks about is sex.
Ike, what's the matter?  Dude, you've been in here crying all morning. What's going on?  Oh. My. God. Ike, a-are you sure about this?
Hang on, I'm chaining my fire spells for max range.
And did you see her lazy eye? You can't even tell what she's looking at.
Yep! I love basketball. I wanna play for the Denver Nuggets one day.
They laughed hardest at our video. We're gonna win!  We're gonna win!
No. Then I came into this virtual space.
Yeah. You aren't having any doubts, are you?
Did Cartman just say "shitballs" to the principal?
I can't keep doing it, Wendy. I know he has an illness, but goddamn, it uh, it's like being around a black hole that just sucks the life out of everything.
I know. Something big is going on. Take a look at this. I did a Google search for "Hillary Clinton Campaign Rally" right? And one of the links was to YouTube, where this Russian guy had a bunch of videos.
This is when you gotta get mean, Tweek.
This tape makes people freak out wherever it goes.
God-damnit! Now, what the hell are we gonna do?!
Please, you have to listen to me! The prophecy actually did come true!
Yeah. Your fat ass isn't on the sled!
Ike!  Stop the bus! Miss Crabtree, you have to stop this bus!
Uh, sir, d'I have a lot of homework to do tonight and I was-
All right, this is it! If Wall-Mart has a heart, we have to find it and destroy it! No matter what the Wall-Mart does to try to stop us, we have to be strong! Let's do it.
I still say this is a bad idea.
What the hell is wrong with these people?!
But where are we gonna get the money to buy costumes and and the instruments? 
But you need to understand: we have a whale here that needs to get back to his family on the moon.
Oh no! It's that  super-sad Sarah McLachlan commercial! Look away!
They never grow old because they die before they're 30!
We're thinking that a lot of people in town starting too... 
That doesn't make me feel better! I wouldn't even be able to keep it down.
But now let me tweet this for you all to comment upon.
The more connected we get, the more alone we become.If you want change like I do, and feel the same gloom,Then please follow THIS trend, #savethelivingroom
Eh it's "Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow." I taped it last month.
Man, I guess sometimes we let our technology and stuff grow too fast.
No! Because you'll just crap out your butt and then say it came out of your mouth!
Eric, sources are speculating that third-grade student, Pete Thelman , pees sitting down like a girl. We've also got confirmation that Sally Turner  stuffs her bra. And Clyde Donovan has only one testicle.
Hey, are you guys gonna come to Ike's party this weekend?
No.  But I get Channukah presents for eight days.
Oh n-no, I'm not really friends with him.
But Chef always helps us with our problems. When we have a problem, Chef sings to us and makes it better.
Cartman, there's something I need to tell you.
Well, I... kind of gave a homeless guy twenty dollars last night.
...and now I have to go home without him and my parents are going to have me killed.
I can't wait to watch Terrance & Phillip with Bebe.
What are you doing with cats in your attic, fatass?!
Dude, screw this! I don't wanna see anymore!
Baahir Hakeem.  Born in Chicago, eight years old, his favorite color is green... Car, Cartman, what is this all about?
God, that was not cool at all, dude!
We've gotta move away. We've gotta get as far away from this town as possible!
Well, everyone in the world thinks you are. See ya. 
Look, Stam, we-we just wanted to be able to go to the movies and enjoy ourselves, you know? I'm sorry but... you're a bummer to be around. Everything is "that looks like shit" and, and "this is shitty!"
I got 'em! Four tickets, 68th row, to Terrance and Phillip! I waited in line since 3 this morning!
Mph. Okay, Mr. Hankey. We're out. How are you doin'?
I don't know. Ever since he was in that movie, he got all famous.
Now, that's what I call a sticky situation. 
Dude, for the last time, don't call my brother a dildo!
Yeah, maybe starting a detective club isn't such a bright idea.
That's nothing compared to what my mom will do to me if she finds out I've been lying for five years!
I don't think my mom would want me doin' this.
Jimmy, we're gonna have everyone write in a mascot that's really funny, and you have to tell us which one would be funnier.
Hooray for the earth! We must protect it.  And now, as promised, here are TERRANCE AND PHILLIP, on video! 
I'm telling you, it's okay. Maybe you should ask the Lord for guidance.
Dude, what do you mean "We don't have a coach."?
I've been trying! But I just don't know how to make totally new friends on the Internet.
You made us pull you to safety because you ate treasure?! You son of a bitch!
How did your date with Ms. Ellen go?
Thanks for saving us Stan. You're my Super Best Friend.
Yeah, that's Cave of the Winds. It's a tourist attraction.
I said I'm sorry, you piece of sh- 
Uh, we need to go to Canada. As soon as possible.
Wait a minute, Dad was the UPS man?
Okay. N-no, ah I don't want that much responsibility-bility. Here, you hold on to it, Kenny. 
Eh-heh. L-look, if you want an explanation, you you'd better go to Kenny's house.
Cartman, I really, really have a problem with what you're doing. I object to it morally, and I find it grossly offensive. 
Hey! Look at that line!  It's way shorter.
All right, what do you guys wanna ride first?
But dude, check out my new Trapper Keeper.  It has five different compartments for each subject in school,  and it's all covered with pictures from Dawson's Creek.
Come on, Ike, we can make it just in time for dinner. 
You can't talk to Stan, Wendy. He throws up when you do.
So... why would one come to America to warn us about a terrorist attack.
I'm confused. Did Ally Sheedy take that personality test?
You know, I didn't even get home until 2:30.
Dammit!  Ike, if you wanna keep your penis, you have to get on this train.  Ready, Ike? Kick the baby!
Check it out: Now we're going into the secret underground base.
It's just sending images of cities and people and stuff.
I, I know it's tough but-  Look at me!  I know it's tough, okay?! I know! But we have to be tough right now!
Ech, even if it could work, how would we go about shutting it down?
Oh, you're doing it, or else we're gonna bust your whole scheme wide open, and tell your mom you haven't actually been at your drug rehab this whole time!
Why the hell would they want that anyway?  Episode I sucked balls.
Well you should. The poor guy shouldn't be screamed for something that just isn't that big a deal at all. 
So you intended for us to go ziplining all along? Why, Stan?!
Yeah, that leprechauns were real! And the government just declared they AREN'T technically real, so I was right! It's over! I don't have to suck your balls!
All right. Thanks for your help, dudes.  Well, we did it, guys. It wasn't easy, but... we did a really amazing thing.
It's a really dry cold; that's the problem. It- the cold air makes me wheeze.
So we've gotta find another way out of here.
Goddamnit, you see what happens when you spread this stupid crap, fatass?
I think I see the television department in the back!
Patrick Duffy? Damn it Cartman, that's not scary!
Stan, you're just jealous of that third grader and you think Wendy's gonna go for him unless you start singing and dancing too.
Dude, don't you see that it's not? It'd be like, changing Raiders of the Lost Ark!
I have to save my little brother! I have to send him away until my parents come to their senses!  Come on, Ike!  Cover me for a while. I'll find a place to hide him and come back.
Man, I would have loved to seen to seen the look on Trent Boyett's face when all the sixth graders showed up!
We can't, dude. Not until we find Mr. Hankey. 
Look, Stan, I'm finally whole! My dad is even gonna take me back down to the all-star game to see if I can try out for the team again!
This game is fixed! The balls are bigger than Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth!
Dude, it's bad enough we have to sit here without you taking a crap every ten minutes!
They're goin' to show the new Terrance & Phillip trailer
I just want a nurection so I can give it to my mom.
I can't say "ookie mouth" and have Kenny spit down my throat at the same time. It's impossible. 
Alright alright Kenny, calm down. You're too young to be getting BJs anyway. It's good you and Tammy are making a commitment to each other that isn't based on sex.
Cartman is trying to bring Christmas to Iraq.
I went up to Jambu's tank and I tapped three times like the trainer did. Jambu swam up and started talking to me about rocket ships! Come on! You gotta check it out! 
Heidi Turner said you asked her to borrow superglue last week.
Everything turned out okay for those people. And so now you can laugh.
We all have Attention Deficit Disorder. So we all started taking Ritalin.
You don't wash your hands after going to the bathroom!
God damn it!  Wendy, Stan wants to know why you break up. 
Goddamnit, Cartman! What are they gonna say on Cop Drama?
Llook, I know I'm not the best-looking guy in town, but I I didn't think I was the very ugliest.
You don't think that-? But he isn't real.
There's no Jews in San Francisco, you retard!
Stan! You've got to help us become good Christians. Please.
Some kids think I'm strange 'cause I like studying for an exam
But I don't let that bother me, because it's who I am. 
Aw, dude! You can still kinda see the spleen!  How much, Kenny?
Awwgh! Hey dude, we don't even have enough weight to move.
Don't be stupid, Cartman. Our teacher wouldn't be out lying in the forest waiting to kill us!
Really? Thanks, dude! I'm gonna go get a video camera! 
Dude, this is probably the best episode they've ever done!
I don't know what we're going to do? It's been like four hours and people still won't talk to us.
So, how are things going at Cartman's theme park?!
Come on! Everything's gonna be okay!  Sir! Sir!
Can you guys meet me over at Cartman's house tonight at around midnight?
Ohh, right, you're supposed to pull and master-benate your wiener really fast.
No you're not, dude! You're a guy in a panda costume! 
See? You can still make it for the end of the party.
We told you they were real Cartman. Sorry to hear about your ass.
God-dammit! If we miss the commercials, I'll never forgive my brother!
I appreciate what you're trying to do, Mick, but I ain't a charity case yet.
Why don't you just sneak in your mom's closet and get a picture when she's changing clothes?
Oh, and what do you know about stem cells?!
You dumbass, Cartman! Now they're gonna go squeeze his balls!
We're all gonna pitch in on an entry!Ah, damn it! My little brother's trying to follow me to school again.
It looks even better than their first movie, huh?
Come on, dude. I wanna get out of here.
Don't try and stop me, Stan! You don't know how it feels to be a deformed monstrosity!
Dude. Are you sure that fish is a murderer? It seemed like a normal fish to me.
Don't you think it's a little strange that Cartman keeps asking you to stay over?
Dude! I had the same dream! We jumped on a dragon's back and, and Butters got left behind!
Look, dude, things around here have changed. Sometimes, the only way to keep going is to make a left turn.
Well ah I guess in wrestling we're supposed to make our own outfit, and then wear it over this.
I wrote down... all the lyrics to the Happy Days theme song.
No it isn't, it hurts! I can't believe they let us play this in school.
But you were just gonna take it out in the backyard and put a bullet in its head!
But Chef, you just ripped on Chinese people.
What I understand is that you totally screwed me over!! So why should I have to listen to you?!
Like a..big hunk of dirt with a carrot sticking out of it.
I heard you won't even get in the deep end.
Dude, I'm telling you. It's crazy. All my little brother wants to do is sit on YouTube watching this PewDiePie play video games. I swear, I don't understand kids these days.
We're totally screwed!  They took the two best judges away!
Hey! Let's pour them in the teacher's coffee tomorrow morning.
Nice old Mr. Johansen runs a candy shop! He wasn't a killer and you know it!
Get him!  Whoa, Tweek! Did you hear that?
Mom? Can Kenny go to Jewbilee with me?
But that is what happened! It is! Tell them, Cartman!
You sold us out?! For an iPod Nano?!
All you ever do is talk about your balls!
Dude. I don't think I wanna be a part of this anymore.
It's my seat ring. I have to sit on it because of my hemorrhoid.  Ow.
Oh come on! It's obvious what happens! I get killed by Santa Claus so that Christmas is saved!
You guys don't even make a six-layer burrito!
You did, dude! You drank his whole body!
Yeah! Now, which one of you is the Cartman we can't stand?!
Dude, this whole building is going to collapse!
Not your dad, Cartman! What's your dad got to do with this?!
You need to freeze some of your ass off.
This is how they talk to us!  You'd better watch your mouth, kid!
We just wanna warn you: Eric Cartman, the fourth grader, is goin' tuh try and trick you somehow into getting your wiener bitten off by a pony who lives at Denkins' ranch.
'Cause old ladies are fat and you are, too!
Everyone is watching everything.  Ike?  Ike, if you can hear me, I'm sorry. I have been a grandpa.  I didn't understand the things you are into and I and I thought you should like the same stuff that I did.  I have to accept that you're gonna have your own things. I just didn't want you to watch HIM. I just... I just wanna be a family again.
I found the number for a really cheap airline to Canada. If we go as soon as possible, then-
No!  I am NOT letting you go to that television studio and pretend... to care about safety and sensitivity to get a show you don't like off the air!
Yes! I can't help but take some credit for this. I helped convince him to go!
The liposuction is a process of siphoning out the excess fat. 
I know! But that doesn't matter any more! These kids don't wanna play the game, they just wanna watch people on YouTube play it.
Come on guys! We gotta go tell Chef he's in love with a succubus.
You gotta come to Kenny's house with us.
You've gotta try and stay on for ten seconds. Okay, Cartman?
So, what do you want to do now?
Yes, I believe that you believe you helped write that joke. That's how people like you work! Your ego is so out of whack that it will do whatever it can to protect itself. And people with a messed up ego can do these mental gymnastics to convince themselves they're awesome, when really, they're just douchebags! 
Stan, you can use family love as a weapon against Shelly.  The next time she's gonna kick your ass, just tell her, "Shelly, you're my sister, and I love you."
It's only three days until Christmas, you guys! You know how bad things have been around here. I think it might be because Mr. Hankey hasn't come.
Y-yeah, but… the color of someone's skin doesn't matter.
Cartman, I thought all you wanted was a Haibo doll!
Please, sir. I traveled a long way to get here. He's the only person who can help me.
Come on, Cartman! You haven't liked anybody else!
What should we do, dude? That big snake keeps growing; it's gonna demolish the whole state soon!
Whoa, I don't think anyone's been in here for centuries
Maybe it's better you don't know who your father is, Cartman.
But Dad, this is all the never-before-seen footage.
Be sure to take me to the same hospital!
All right, fine! We don't need you, Butters!
Ugh! We're gonna end up watching this whole retared Russell Crowe show!
Yeah, check this one out. Ready, Ike? Kick the baby!
You know what? I'll bet it was you!
Wow, I didn't know golf games were this cool.
Cartman, we can't do this alone. You have to get up.
Cartman, what the hell are you doing here?! You quit!
All right, cool.  Let's download some Metallica, and some Stevie Wonder. 
I saved up enough to buy M-80s this year.
Right. But in the 1340s people in England stopped calling it "skite" and started calling it "shit." The same year as the Black Plague.
Hey Ike, you wanna come watch TV with me?
Phil Collins Hill on Saturday! You got it!
And that's why I feel like you guys are more than just friends. You're my family.  Except for Cartman.
He's a talking piece of poo that lives in the sewer. But now he's getting sick because his egosystem is all out of whack because of all the extra poo in the sewer. If you don't all leave and go home soon, Mr. Hankey's gonna die. He's one of my best friends in the whole wide worldeh, and I don't want him to die. 
Well, that didn't work. What else can we try?
Well, our friend Marvin and all his people have to live on a part of Earth that sucks ass. They can't grow food or nothin'.
All right! Now, come on! We have to practice! 
Well, Cartman, thanks to you we don't have any money left to win the Terrance and Phillip dolls!
Dude, don't forget: Timmy is the only kid who can play Helen Keller. Don't piss him off.
Butters, can't you see this is wrong? You've got little boys all over school spending all their lunch money on kisses. Boys shouldn't be paying for kisses. It's wrong.
Yeah. They've kinda killed Kenny -'s look-alike. You bastards!
You guys! You guys! I've looked up the word, "shit"! I think it might have something to do with people dying!
Alright, that does it, Cartman! That's my grandma! You show her some God-damned respect!
Oh, dude, I don't know how I can take it.
What's the big deal? Don't you understand what ignorant prejudice like that can lead to? I have to disprove Cartman's hateful rumors! Do you know any red-haired, freckled kids?
I'm sorry, can I come back in just a little bit?
They on'tday?!  Why the ellhay otnay?! It ooktay ourfay ourshay to akebay this Od-damnedgay akecay, and ownay we're otallytay ewedscray!
It's crazy, dude! They're saying it's because I agreed to the latest terms and conditions on iTunes!
Come on guys! He's hidden them somewhere and we have to find them!
Well what the hell are we gonna do? Dress him up in a princess gown and, and parade him around like the parents on those awful child pageants? 
Yeah. Let's just have a slumber party here.
Did you make it to your job interview?
We don't know who else to talk to.
Garrison is taking us all on a field trip today. He wants to do the final egg check in front of the Governor's office!
Just do it again, Cartman, and don't make it talk! 
We told him to grow up. So he got rid of his stuffed animals.
If we win, we can buy a new go-cart that actually runs.
Uha, wa, actually, I- I can't eat beef. I have a degenerative problem with my intestinal lining, and beef really gives me gaass.
Holy shit. Then this is all real. We've all been here from the beginning. Taking turns on the Oculus Rift headset.
Yeah, they're almost as big as his mom's. 
Take a look, fatass! I beat you! You aren't going on Dateline; what have you got to say now?! 
Mr. Hankey.  He comes out of the toilet every year and gives presents to everybody who has a lot of fiber in their diet.
Oh my God! Our GameSphere! You've gotta move me closer! 
Doesn't anyone understand the significance of "I'm sorry" anymore?
He just... He just... stopped breathing. And it was over.
I know, but dude, we can't license our games to EA Sports and pay the crack babies nothing. Slavery is illegal.
We can't tell our parents, dude! We lied to everybody! Nobody knows we're responsible for Ms. Claridge's accident!
Wait! You know what we should do? We should all take a bunch of cough medicine!
Yeah. I guess their rules did have a point. Things have gotten a lot worse in the ten days since they've been gone.
How dare she talk to us like that?!
No, but look: I just got this sweet Cyborg Bill doll.
Well, guys, I guess we're going to Canada.
That's great, Butters, but we're not playing Detective anymore. We're playing laundromat owners.
Yeah. The more distance between me and the others from Jersey, the better I feel.
Ike, don't do it! There's still so much to live for!  I know you really wanted McCain to win but, but it's going to be okay.  No, that's not true, Ike. The economy could easily stabilize with Obama's plan.  Ike, don't jump! You could really hurt your ankle or something.  Really Ike, that's like five feet off the ground. Don't do it.
I need you to keep quiet about this, all right?  My little brother and his tea-
Dad.  Dad, Ike and I have been talking, and well, we feel that your new car is changing you.
We're gonna teach that fat bastard a lesson!
Doctor, could we talk to her for a minute?
Just admit you were lying, Cartman, so that everyone can go home!
You wanna kill me?! Fine!  I can't live like this anymore! Go ahead! Do it! 
Oh my God, what if I'm not real?
Ungh, it said in my book that the word, "shit", started exactly the same time as something called, "The Black Death".
Chef, we need Butters to gain about fifty pounds fast.
Come on! Let's go make fun of him!
Dude, that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
Dude, I guess we've just got to try it without him.
Yeah. But you know, I've learned something today. You see, the basis of all reasoning is the mind's awareness of itself. What we think, the external objects we perceive, are all like actors that come on and off stage. But our consciousness, the stage itself, is always present to us.
It was my idea and we're gonna tell everyone to write in "Giant Douche!" It's way funnier!
Hey Stan, did you see that rainbow this morning?
You can't kill all three of us, Cartman!
...a-are starting to take offense at your actions. We feel like you're starting to become-hmm... 
Oh, God.  Wuh. Aah. Get out of here!
Try it.  We'll see you in a while, we got to go get Cartman's pig.
Kenny didn't have the head lice, all right?!  It was me.
What? You mean like you don't like the singing, or the lyrics, or what?
Our parents won't let us have weapons, dude. 
Wait. You guys, I have an awesome idea! We should secretly go around and tell all the students we can, to not check any of the mascots on this election sheet, and instead write in "Giant Douche."
What the hell is everyone wearing on their heads?
I don't know. We just have to get it to town and let them figure out what to do with it.
Ass full of pork fat
jiggles like a Jello mold.
Mouth is flapping, too.
You're telling me that every time you guys download an update for iTunes, you read the entire terms and conditions?
I can't believe they would put a fake Mr. Hankey in a mall! If Mr. Hankey ever found out, he'd be so pissed!
Aww. Well Cartman, you can change things about yourself.
Dad, there is so a tooth fairy, huh?
You wanna bet?  Let's go ask my Dad right now!
No, that... I thought that was a lot.
Stop saying "hella," Cartman!  How are we gonna win the contest with a squash?  Whoa, Stan. You don't look so good.
Look everybody, I know we all feel our hands are tied, but the fact is, we can do something about this. There's an app which can actually allow kids to block things that their parents watch on television. And it is password-protected with a security code that only a child would know.
Hey, you're not such a bad guy after all, Damien.
Hey dudes.  Sorry I couldn't make it yesterday. What'd you guys do?
Stan, this is it. Time to stop feeling sorry for yourself and come home! Everyone cares about you and everyone wants you back!
Yeah, we made the whole thing up. It was all just a really, really funny joke! 
Ih it's me, Kyle Broflovski. I had a negroplasty. Can I play in the All-State team now?
Mr. Hat, may I please be excused from class?
I mean, yeyou people are all just such hick jock rednecks; it's just like you right out of a stereotyped catalog.  Ah I can't take it. See ya. 
Do with us what you will, Mr. Lucas!  But please, don't change Raiders of the Lost Ark.
Charlie's right! I'm not gonna let some fake Mr. Hankey spoil my holidays.
Why do people have to keep reminding us of what we don't have?!
There is a crisis in America! As families grow further and further apart-
Are we the only ones here who are completely confused?
Set an open course for the virgin sea...
I got it! I got my Chinpokomon game controller! 
Guys, I think we should bail out of this right now!
Yeah, but he's some kind of genius, so he's getting advanced placement in kindergarten.
So can I go to the Magic Camp, to learn how to become a full member? All the other guys are doin' it, and it's only $69.95.
We can't wait here any longer! Dude, we've gotta get him out of here or he's gonna die.
Excuse me, is this really what you think she should be doing right now?
I think it went really good. Those people really got into it.
Yeah, this church kicks a-- Eh... I-it kicks!
You've been on your fucking phone since we started!
I need one ticket for my little brother.
We really think this is gonna work, Stan. All we have to do is convince your dad that his cooking sucks, right?
Look, however hard you think it for you, it's a lot harder for him!
Aw Goddamnit, now you've made me miss my ride! My whole day is screwed up because of you! 
I'll never forget you. You were my best friend after Stan.
Hybrid cars don't cause smugness, people do.  Look, hybrid cars are important. They may even save our planet one day. What you all need to do is just learn to drive hybrids and not be smug about it.
Stan, people in Beaverton are still trapped on their roofs. Nobody's helping them because they think they can't go outside.
Nobody's blood is going to jump up in the air!
No-no-no-no. Come on, fatass, we're gonna get 'em all back.
That's us!  "Dear MOOP. This letter is to inform you that Faith Plus One's debut album has just sold one million copies."
All I wanted was to play one level of Call of Duty and you know what Ike told me? He said the living room was for old people.
I can't wait until the teacher yells at us this time, and we all tell her to suck our balls!
Hey, excuse me, but we need some help.
They're just drunk, Cartman! As soon as they sober up, they'll stop.
Ike, I don't care if you wanna grow up, I just wanna be by your side while you do it.
Lots of people will when I tell them!
Goddammit Cartman, stop throwin' those stupid poppy-things at me! 
Dude, my mom won't even let me have a hamster.
Jesus, dude. W-w-what happened? It's like, something's lowered the bar to the point that nobody feels any shame anymore.
You better watch what you say Cartman! You might be poor and hungry some day.
Dude, we've been working this case since two-thirty!
Look, we don't have a lot of time here, okay? Can you just tell us where the new Prime Minister is?
Ah I was just trying to... just, just in one instance... No. No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
Whoa, dude. The road is really snowy out there.
Yeah, what kind of name is Pip anyway?!
Yeah, all you have to do is fart some more, Cartman! And the visitors are sure to come!
So I'm thinking we do the part about Jimmy's relationship with his alcoholic father after you smash Butters onto the table.
Yeah. I think we should get the hell out of here.
Yes we do! We have a sweet name.  I was wrong, Cartman. "Washington Redskins" is the perfect name. I think maybe I was jealous that I didn't come up with it.
You mean, throw the game? You know how our parents are about this sport.
No it isn't. Come on, I have an idea.
That's not true, fatass! I have red hair, and I don't have to avoid the sun!
Oh please! All you ever do is call me names and rip on me for being Jewish!
Whoever it might happen to be, I'm not giving him the opportunity. Tomorrow I'm going to do something. Something I've known I would have to do restore people's faith.
No! Maybe we all just need a little image change, you know? Like a makeover.
Geez, all that from a stupid video show.
Give me that!  Hey! It hit her right in the mouth!
Alright, we don't know for sure why Cartman is ditching school, but it has something to do with abortion. That's all we know.
Well, I finally got my family to use the living room for an hour each night.
When the bar gets lowered, Token, we all pay the price. What if Honey Boo Boo was a little black girl? Being fattened up by her mom and talking about grits and hominy?
Stan, if I didn't know you better, I would almost think you're doing this because you wanna play with girls.
Hey, it's a fire. That means there must be people. 
Mom, Ike did it again. I don't know what's going on with him, but, it's like he hates me.
Well, I'm sure glad this is all over with. Let's go count our candy.
It's too late. The treatment would have killed it all.
Come on Stan, don't you even know where you would go?
Hey guys. You wanna throw the football around?
Oh, shut up, Cartman. All you did was jump over one homeless guy.
Well, looks like everything turned out alright for them.
D-ude, I totally miffed that middle part. Did you see that?
...No, dude, that's not the trailer for Terminator 5, that really happened.
Listen to me: the little boy who convinced you to pull the episode is a bastard child. He only wants you to pull it because he knows it will be the end of Family Guy forever!
Give it up, Kenny! You're not gonna win that costume contest! Your costumes always suck. 
Cartman! I will not stand by and let you cheat your way to winning the Special Olympics!
Dude, that video is making people act strange.
I think I'll add some more... pigs.  Oh, maybe I should put in another field of corn there.  There we go. Nice.  Twenty nine? No, I have thirty friends.  Hey what the hell is-? Oh no! Oh shit! 
Some high schoolers left their marijuana cigarette behind. Uh we have to throw it away before some kids find it or something.
You're having dinenr with his family? What kind of family has a kid like that?
Yummy yummy yummy I want Cartman's farts in my tummy.
Well everyone has already seen it; nothing we can do about it now.
Well, cou, couldn't just you know, get rid of the part of Tooth Decay?
Yeah, this life is short. The afterlife is forever.
No, no, no.  We want to make little pot-bellied elephants that people can keep in their houses as pets.
Look, we've just gotta get Chef alone. He won't listen to reason with that hooker around.
Will you get out of my living room, please?!  Hello?!
This is wrong. Uh this just doesn't make any sense. Why would Homeland Security send us into Peru?
A ladder to heaven.  We build it, climb up, and get our winning ticket back from that asshole Kenny.
Because, dude, we're playing detectives! Detectives don't just go tell on people.
He'd be better used as a coat rack. 
Uuuh, Cartman. We know how you can get $3000.
Yeah. Hey Stan, what did your dad mean when he said we're gonna play Truth or Dare?
Noo! Wait! You can't listen to him! He's a lying deceitful monster who only wants Family Guy off the air!
Your girlfriend doesn't even like you, Stan the Man! She likes me!
But, dude this doesn't make any sense. I mean, if you know it's going to make you crap blood, why wouldn't you at least just try eating less of it?
Well, unfortunately for us, he's now on the other side! We are out of options!
Yyeah, except maybe it's not perfectly great, because to some degree, Ike and Ms. Stevenson are having an-.
All these people are going to be gaming on XBox. You really wanna just game with Craig the rest of your life?
Did you guys hear what's going on? There's like four girls at the school now offering to kiss boys for money.
Miss Stevens, you have a bug on your back.
Yeah. We're very good friends. We're very good friends, Stan!
What?! You were waiting for me in the bathroom!
Uhhh, how d- how do we start this thing?
Those things are stupid, Cartman. They just stick your hand in cold spaghetti and tell you it's intestines and stuff.
So then don't have a slumber party if you're gonna be an asshole all night!
Come on, fatass! You shouldn't be eating all that cake anyway!
Yeah. You know, I've learned something today. Family isn't about whose blood you have, it's about who you care about.
Well... what kind of stuff does she like? Do you know?
'Kay, so now just click on the little soil button...  and then maybe put a sign up to comment on my farm...  Okay, now I can read the sign you put up...
IT WASN'T MY IDEA, IT WAS YOURS! YOU KILLED KENNY, YOU BASTARD!
Look, the truth is, we all have a bigger problem now, and you know it. Nobody is going to get anything if we don't work together against those thousands of other shoppers.
Yeah. Stan said they're having them over for dinner tonight.
No I won't, because you'd eat 'em first, tubby. 
So get off your fucking scooters and pick them up!
What could it be? If only we knew what we were up against.
No! All we have to do is not shop at Wall-Mart anymore! If you want it to go away, all it takes is a little self-control and personal responsibility.
You mean you can see him?  Ah-I'm not crazy? 
Only sixteen dollars? They can't be cool if they're only sixteen dollars. 
Do you think we can still make it in time?
Move on?! Our friend was raped, Stan! He was raped, and we all stood there and did  nothing!
Yes, I did! I said from the beginning that you would do this!
Yes, yes! Now the Jews shall take control of Christmas once and for all! HAHA! HAAA!!
I don't know, I-I just thought if we all drank the Mountain Dew, the caffeine and the sugar would help us stay awake. I told Cartman he has to share it.
This is your fault, Cartman! Now we're gonna fail!
Bye-bye seeme mama.  Ah, I'm gonna take him up to the bathroom to get washed up. 
He just stacked his Shapeshifter with an Elven Blade!
That does it! I know what I have to do! 
I mean, come on guys, that's pretty cool, right? My little brother is a knight in Canada. 
But I did! Ah, I brought democracy to Cuba!
Look Butters, why don't you just talk to your family about it? You said your Grandma's visiting this week. Why don't you try talking to her?
Ten million?? Well that's more than the Germans want!
But we actually are busy. Tonight's the big fight.
We went to a bunch of rock stars and sold them candy bars to raise the money you needed.
Yeah, and if you couldn't prove there was a leprechaun, you have to give me ten dollars! Now just pay up and stop being stupid!
We live. That's what Indy would have wanted. We just try... to live.
No, no, no! Don't become an angry mob!  The last time we did that we killed Jesus!
When a man and a woman feel ...love... they put their lips together.
Yeah, we've shown them amusement parks and malls. How can you expect them to go back now??
That's retarded! You didn't come up with that experiment, Cartman, you saw it in that movie, The Thing!
How much do we have left, Cartman?  How much do we have left, Cartman?!
Well, I've gotta go start our animation. We've only got two days. 
You guys, we've just been screwed over and lied to!
Uh, hi, we want you to end this strike. 
Butters, we are sick! Don't you get it?! We're gonna end up just like Kenny!
I don't think Ike wants to go to Squirts.
Hey, you scrawny-eyed shithead, what the fuck is wrong with you?! You must be some kind of fucking asshole to be able to ignore a crying child!
I'm supposed to go to the lake with my family tomorrow and swim and play in the stupid sun.
Ma'am, we are a very important talent agency. If your producers knew you were forcing people of our stature to the back of the line, well-
So, just to be completely clear, now it isn't funny, right?
Look, Stan, we're really getting concerned about this cult that you're getting into.
I'm gonna make a new costume during recess. I can still win that candy.
All right, let's just say all the bad things said about Mr. Jefferson are lies! Let's say the police department does just go around spending their time framing people for crimes they didn't commit!  Let's say it's all made up, and Mr. Jefferson is just a nice guy who's trying to be a child because he never got to have a childhood. Well that's fine, except for that he HAS children now! And when people have children, they have to grow up!
Kenny didn't have the ticket stub. It was in his room. So we got all our candy, and you can all go home.
No, dude. They only changed "terrorist" to "hippie" to make E.T. more P.C.
If you don't show Mohammad, then you've made a distinction what is okay to poke fun at, and what isn't. Either it's all okay, or none of it is.
It's not too late to do what's right. Give us the print. There's still some good in you, Mr. Lucas. We know there is. 
Hehe. Why the hell did you dress up like Raggedy Andy dude?
It's been a week since Ike's been gone, and every day my parents seem worse. I have to try to go to Canada and speak with the new Canadian Prime Minister, but I can't do it alone.
She's been built up to be sacrificed, Stan!
Not now, Cartman! I have really serious problems!
...And see? Here's one from Butters. It says, "We can't wait to see you back in school, Kenny." And it has a picture of him and you in a little airplane! 
Wait a minute, the rights to Star Wars, the movies? What the hell is going on here?!
That's what bothering you? Not the fact that you're a murderer?
It wasn't my idea to burn the Wall-Mart down.
Dude, I think it might be best for us to never piss Cartman off again.
My Dad says he can't live here anymore.
He's right. We have to take a hard stance right now and establish that we're the dominant ones in this relationship! 
Hi, uh- our friend has been brainwashed by some fruity little club.
Ladies and gentlemen, my best friend, Mr. Hankey, is getting sick because South Park has become overcrowded with people who eat health food.
I can't believe how cold it is out here.
Yeah he's an idiot but uh I'm sorry, I just... I can't do this anymore, okay? I... I can't do this anymore! 
And then takes you to Chipotle, and buys you more?
Whoa. Check it out, dude.  It's got little drawings on it.
How do we know which one to use?
Yes we do! Just not the Christian heaven!
Yeah, I just... well I just thought our company name would be more like uh... or-original
Dude, it's got a hundred twenty eight gigahertz D-RAM.
Look, it may not seem important now, but your vote really does count, and we all have to do our part.
City Wok brought him down to a size 4.
You guys, who cares if the girls make some stupid list? Girls make dumb lists all the time.
We believe that films have to be taken away from people like Steven Spielberg and George Lucas because they're insane.
No way, dude! It sucked ass! They don't even have cable!
Hey, we'd do anything for our bros, man.
I think the rabbit just crapped on my jacket.
I think he said he wants to practice on a real bull.
Yeah. I'm sure whatever that Super Adventure Club does is pretty tiring.
Kenny, what's funnier? A giant douche or a turd sandwich?
Wait. Wait. I think I can explain this whole thing. Marklar, these marklars want to change your marklar. They don't want Marklar or any of these marklars to live here because it's bad for their marklar. They use Marklar to try and force marklars to believe they're marklar. If you let them stay here, they will build marklars and marklars. They will take all your marklars and replace them with Marklar. These marklar have no good marklar to live on Marklar, so they must come here to Marklar. Please, let these marklars stay where they can grow and prosper without any marklars, marklars, eh or marklars.
You've never watched the news, fatass!  And what the hell does that have to do with anything?!
Ike, you'll always be my little brother, okay?
Don't, don't act for me, Stan! Really?! Because every minute I'm watching this video become less about awareness and more about you!
We have to watch them! We can't miss it!
But that's not fair! You lied to me!
I can't believe it. I can't believe we have to keep on playing.
No, I just can't get it to load.
Oh, brother, here we go again. Cartman, there is not a sound frequency that makes people crap their pants!
E-excuse me, my little brother needs medical attention.
Dude, this book says I don't exist unless I think I do. But what if I don't?
People of all colors and creeds holding hands beneath a rainbow!
I'll meet up with you guys in a little bit. I-I wanna hang out here some more.
Broflovski looks for Kenny to get clear for the pass.
Will somebody just get me to a hospital? I need to get my stomach pumped!
Sure. Remember that time that that kid in the red shirt decided to go off on his own?
Okay, Ike. You're my little brother, so I have to show you how to celebrate Hanukkah.  This is called a dreidel. You spin it and see where it lands. And you sing this song:
I have a little dreidel; I made it out of clay.
And when it's dry and ready, with dreidel I shall play. Oh,
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay.
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with dreidel I shall play.
You're not copying my homework, you lazy turd.
Look at yourself! You've got to lay off the cheese! 
Don't worry, Ike. Squirts is fun. And I'll be right over there in the next building. 
In our deal with EA Sports we are giving them the right to use images of the crack babies and their names. But we aren't paying the crack babies.
Princess Kenny, I believe it's time we returned the Wizard's hospitality! 
Maybe they took it literally when we said we wanted to adopt a kid.  Whoa! That was cool.
"And as the voluminous corporate automaton bulldozes its way through bantam America...
Should be the next one. 2778 Mala Vista Drive. Wait, this is City Wok.
A woman pooping out her boobs is not good imagery!
Shhh. Willzy-x, don't say anything. We're gonna bust you out of here.
I wonder why our moms want us to sleep over at Kenny's so bad.
I don't wanna go to your stupid movie premiere!  And don't tape that to my locker!  Oh God. 
I'm sorry, Kip, but I really can't be your friend anymore. It was a great ride, but I must say goodbye. This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do, but ending a friendship... is never easy. 
Wow. Did he say that in the Bible?
Oh. Good idea, Phillip. Let's look for treasuh.
Okay, okay, wewe'll switch off. Starvin' Marvin can stay here for a week, then at Stan's, then with me.
Naw, I think I'm through with fads for a while.
Wow, I wish we had a stupidest home video. 
So then we sit there for like, thirty minutes, because we had to wait for this couple who was running late. 
I didn't see a handkerchief. Did you see a handkerchief, Kenny?
You mean to tell me that all this time I've been trying to protect Ike from having his fireman cut off, and he's not even my real brother?!
The sea people from Cartman's side are suicide-bombing the buildings on Tweek's side.
Cartman, don't be such a baby! We're supposed to be rugged outdoorsmen!
He was out all alone in the middle of the night. Mr. Jefferson isn't even home.
Whoa, dude. Your dad is watching Terrance and Phillip.
No way dude. I'm gonna win the costume contest with this sweet Chewbacca costume.
We need to get our friend to a hospital right away!
Yes it is a big deal! Why do you think everyone washes their hands after they go to the bathroom?!
I'll call the producers of the show. They'll help you find your dad.
Ugh. Can't you see this is my dream?? Music is my life!
What the hell is that?  Oh my God. 
Ohhh, no you don't. That isn't gonna work on me, Canadian!
But dude, there must be something in your past you're not dealing with.
'K.  She says she's been wantin' to break up for a while, and it's nothing against you.
...You put Kenny's picture on a milk carton??
Meh? Ike, we have a whole day to play XBox! Mom and Dad are leaving!
Don't try and stop me, Stan! This is what my grandma wants!
I just didn't think it would come so soon.
We could go to the city pool. They have a water slide
Dude, you don't have to be ashamed or anything.
What if the residue gets on our hands and it leads to harder drugs like those commercials say.
Ah I'm sorry, but I don't really care. I just want to know what medication my little has been getting from you, and why?!
If some of us are on PS4s, but the rest of us are on XBox's, then we all can't play together online. See? This is all about committing to one machine.
He worked so hard, come so close. Now we'll never see Kenny crawl up into Ms. Crabtree's uterus.
Well... maybe I'll take just half a hit of acid.
Hey yeah! That'd be sweet! We could totally ruin their lives! 
You want Tammy to give you a B.J.?
So if you're identical, does that mean you all think alike?
Wow. That's a lot of sea men you've got there, Cartman.
That penisbutt didn't lose weight eating sub sandwiches. He lost weight because he ate less of them and exercised.
Why? How could you do this? There are people starving in Alabama and... and you give Cartman a million dollars?
Mr-&#160;! Goddammit. Here, come on. We need to clean that up. 
Oh, so big deal, guys! Do you feel better now? Clyde's the best looking kid in the class. And then Token and Stan, and last is Francis, Cartman, and...  Me?
Hey. Ms. Crabtree had that little TV, for the trainng video? Maybe we can watch TV on it.
Hey, fatass! Instead of laying in bed eating, why don't you come and help?!
If we take him to the hospital, they're gonna find out what happened.
Well, this is what I believe in now, Stan. And if you can't respect that,... then I guess we're not best friends anymore. 
Thank you, rabbi.  In 1973, the United States officially issued an apology to the African American community for slavery. In 1956, Germany officially apologized for World War II AND the Holocaust. And now, I believe, in 2004, the Jewish community needs to apologize for the death of Jesus.
He's gotta show up. He's just got to.
NO! I put your headset on, and came here to-
And if the North wins you're our slave for a month??
Fatass Cartman was
not on the school bus today.
What a big, fat turd.
You guys!  You gotta help me. These business casual G-men are trying to kidnap me!
Love ...is the most important thing on... earth. When boys and girls feel ...love, they kiss.
That's what they're talking about on the news!
Because we do. It was like this yesterday, and the day before that.
But how are we gonna get the balls put on Butters' chin?
You found Cartman like this and you think he's somehow trapped in virtual reality?
We have to confess that we were the ones that-
You use IntelliLink?? Oh my God! Will you check his records please?
Sir, just think about what you're doing to free speech!
I'm gonna take Butters. He invited me to his birthday party last month, so I owe him one.
Stan, we're almost there. You've got to hold on.
It's Mr. Hankey! I think he's in some kind of trouble. 
No asshole! From now on you only get to have one power! So what is it?!
Well why not? You want us to get AIDS?
Oh, thank you! I was so eagerly awaiting your approval of my abilities! 
Uh, oh, this, this is, the new retarded kid.
Oh. Hey, that's not very nice, Mayor. Just because a person is gay doesn't mean he's a fag.
...french fries...pizza...pizza...pizza-french fries... I wonder where our parents are.
Anyways, I need you guys to help me so that my parents don't realize Ike is gone.  Knock it off, asshole!
Well, I- guess we'll see you in school tomorrow, Chef.
Well, you might have made it, but we're the ones who are taking care of it now. You have your own egg to look out for!
Oh no way! Look!  The pan flute band's put in prison, just like what happened. 
We didn't realize hunger made you feel so bad.
Butters, you don't really believe that, do you?
From public school, your house is just a flicker of light.  Don't you want to go out? All you do is... stay in your house and... study
You sonofabitch, Cartman!  You don't fart when you're locked in a small space with other people! 
It says, "Read Teetle the Timid Ta-- Taa-- The Taxi--" What's this word?
Because that's what real artists do. People are always gonna find a way to copy our music and swap it for free. If we're real musicians, then we should just play and be stoked that so many people are listening.
Dude! I've been freaked out this whole time because of that guy's movie?
You just want Family Guy off the air...
Uh oh. I guess we shouldn't have made him eat it. 
That's horrible. If that's true, I don't wanna see it.
We didn't say nothin' about no kids, man!
I guess there's nothing we can do. Chef likes her more than us.
Do you know what happened to me this morning, Stan? This morning... I woke up and felt a sharp pain in my ass. I felt down there and, and found this... big sore lump. On my ass, Stan. I couldn't even sit down, so... I, I had to tell my mother, which, which was humiliating. She took me to the doctor, which was more humiliating, a- a- nd he told me. I-I have a hemorrhoid. It's like an infected blood vessel on your ass. I'm nine years old, and I have a hemorrhoid, Stan. I have a hemorrhoid, and, Cartman has his own theme park.
Well it's just that, eh, this seems like another one of those times when things are gonna get way out of hands, you know? It's been happening a lot lately. How about this time we just put a stop to it right now?
Come out here and talk to me face to face! Open this door!
Because now he's acting like gingers are awesome. And all his friends are gingers. When he wakes up tomorrow and realizes he isn't really ginger, it'll be hysterical!
Is this all you brought us here to see?
We don't know what you're talking about, lardbutt.
Oh, hi. Is Chef here? We have to talk to him.
You unbelievable son of a bitch. You never cared about the Muslim religion. Or the safety of people in America. You just want Family Guy off the air!
Stan, we can't be seen with this nutjob!  Aw, aw, awww!
I don't think it matters, dude. This giant snake is gonna kill everyone soon. 
Dammit! Son of a bitch, dammit!  Oh, sorry.
They got us a truck, and an airplane, and Mr. Worf! The calves are gonna be okay!
Nancy Kerrigan got the silver, dude. She came in second.
I'm never speaking to either of you ever again! 
We did it guys. We finally taught Cartman a lesson. I'll bet that now, Cartman is gonna have a long hard think about how he treated gingers.
Ike is starting his first day of kindergarten.
This is just startin' to look like another one of those times where it-it's gonna end up with the whole town turning out, it's a big showdown happening, and us havin' to talk about what we learned, and I say we just stop right now, and go play cards or something.
I said go away!  My father said you aren't real.
Well, let's try the dictionary.  queasy, Quebec, queen quelch. No queef.
I should have known better! You never cared about my birthday at all!
Hey. They've never been allowed to walk before. They just don't know how.
You can't sit with us, new kid. Go find another table! 
But I thought we were supposed to care on Thanksgiving.
Scott Tenorman is an eighth grader who sold Cartman his pubes for ten dollars, and now Cartman's all pissed off.
A big success?! You can't even get Tyler Perry to go back home!
You think you own the entertainment business, but you don't! Give us back Wing, RIGHT NOW! 
Singing a Christmas song isn't gonna get you nice deductions, Cartman! Don't forget: it's because of you that Santa's sleigh got shot down!
There's still time to tell the network president you're full of CRAP! 
Dude, you're just saying that because she's your girlfriend.
Come on, Ike, hurry up!  Where is the next train going?
Um...  Greetings from Canada.  Well boys, it's aboot time we get to our hoose in Canada, isn't it?
Yeah. Boy, am I glad to see you, Ike.
Uh, could you use it in a sentence?
I don't know what to do.  Part of me feels like I wanna end it all now.  Tell people what heppened. You know, I never knew how beautiful this pond was before.  So cold. The world can feel like that.  So calm on the outside, as if nothing bad ever happens.  Ow.  What the hell are you doing, Cartman?!
Well all right, we'll see you on Saturday, guys.
Yes, but now we don't have any homework, so we can go see Timmy play downtown at Mile High Stadium
Wow Cartman, the visitors dropped you off just in time to go to school.
Mr. Hankey!  Where the hell did you go?
That's a retarded idea that won't work. Why are you really doing this?
Dude, if these guys are as bad as you say, then we have to do something!
Just stop it! That's enough! You aren't reading another sentence of your stupid story!
How... How did this happen?  Mom, Dad? Why are you shopping here?
You see, we've learned something today. Swearing can be fun, but doing it all the time causes a lot of problems.
Can I have three thousand dollars, Mom and Dad, huh?? Can I??
Wait. It's okay. Look, maybe these people all turned out because they believe in saving films. Maybe they don't even care about the free hats.
I've been thinking, Wendy. This whole outcome is pretty strange.
I didn't wanna have to do this.  but if you don't tell us, I'm gonna tell your dad you helped get the wrong person elected President!
With genetic engineering, can you make an elephant smaller?
Aawwww! Hey Dad. Is it true that you and Kenny's dad used to be best friends when you were young?
There's no choice anymore, guys. Don't worry about me. I've been preparing for this for a while now. 
Yeah, isn't he just supposed to be learning how to read?
It's true. We think that word might be plaguing our friend, Kenny.
So, do you uh, do you have any brothers or sisters, Natalie?
Dude, you killed your own dad, and you're worried about that?!
Hey, that went really well. They really liked it.
But why? If they're hungry and poor, why don't we just always give them half of our food?
All right, here we go.  Since the days of Copernicus, man has dreamed of flight. On this historic day we remem- aw, screw it! 
Yes. There's a Russian guy named Vladimir Stolfsky who's got search engine hits all over this thing.
It was really about the most man thing I think we've ever been a part of.
We'd better be. We've been in line for almost an hour!
Well then we're gonna end up freezing his hellish heart with a cool island song.
I want you guys to all meet my friend. 
Yeah. My school teacher wanted to be a woman, and you made him into one.
Don't try to take me away again, Mom and Dad! I told you! I renounced the Jewish faith!
Nobody gives a crap about your Trapper Keeper, Cartman! 
Kenny, we need to have a serious talk.
Ookie mouth!  Gross! I can't do it, Ma!
We're so sorry. Please forgive my little brother. He's going through puberty.
Wait till you guys see my costume! It's gonna be sweet!
Yeah, but if they're wrong, no big deal. If we're wrong, we burn in hell.
Kenny, we have got to make Stan understand the importance of voting, because he'll definitely vote for our guy.
The judging's almost done. You're gonna make it.  Oh God.  SOMEBODY GET ME A CHARGER!  Hold on Stan! Don't die on us!
I don't think they're going to be able to get all of you in frame Cartman.
Sir, you recently passed a new law allowing parents who have given their children up for adoption to change their minds. My little brother was-
Cartman was visited by aliens again last night. And now it's like we're living a repeat of a previous day.
You get away from me, you crazy woman! 
Okay, Stan, you've been an asshole to me all week! What is up?!
All right I've had enough! Leprechauns are imaginary!
If it's on the school network we can track the IP address.  This way. In here.  Whoever it is using the computer in the music room.
But we don't have years! If Chef keeps this up, he's gonna go to jail forever!
What is happening to our living rooms? There is a crisis in America, and-
That was sweet, Bebe.  Now, if you just hold the rock like this, you-
We're not kids. We're full-grown men with dwarfism! How dare you assume that all midgets are children! We demand an apology!
Car... Cartman! You've gotta swim! Kick with your legs!
No, it's still just some whiny, annoying teenager talking about how lame he is.
Yeah. So hurry up and die, you piece of crap! 
We can't miss the final apocalyptic battle between Good and Evil!
Dude! Nobody wants to hear you commenting on things!
What has Michael Jackson always tried to be?
I don't wanna know when I'm going to die, fatass! 
It isn't fair. I spent weeks preparing my speech on Latino culture.
And it actually helps the crack babies. It's like volunteering but, but we just make a little on the side.
Chef, do you know where "shit" comes from?
Dad, if the school has to pay you and Cartman $1.3 million, where does that money come from?
You must have a mom.  You mean she doesn't live here, or she's dead, or what?
Yeah. And the leader, he said that all the Ethiopians can go live there. 
I got it! I got it! According to PayPal, the Russian guys are just hired mercenaries who had ads up on Craig's List and got paid through eBay so that Boston could be attacked by... the British.
So now I should stop liking Chinpokoman because you all don't?
Dude, we're gonna see the new Zoopeeker movie!
We want to talk to who's in charge.
-slashed the bus tires in Arkansas! I said so! I told you the minute that I-  -and I told you that-
You're garbage! You know that?! You're cabbage!  You've got cabbage in your muff!  You've got cabbage in your fuckin' muff! 
Oh wait. Hey AWESOM-O,  I'd also like some celery sticks chopped up two inches long, with peanut butter and raisins on top.
We totally think you should have more money.
When Towelie is doing heroin, he doesn't care about anything.
'Cause, dombass, scary monsters don't eat big fat smelly bitches!
Hey. Hey, look over there, Stan. That Raisins girl is really cute, huh?  Why don't you say hi to her?  Excuse me? 
No! Didn't you guys learn anything? Look, if we make an album, all that's gonna happen is that people are gonna steal our songs for free off the Internet. We won't make a dime!
Okay, it says here the operation begins with a one-inch incision in the ab-do-men on the left side just above the hip.
I am sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Keller, but I'm afraid your daughter Helen still cannot see, hear, or speak.
Let's just stay here and watch the whale swim around some more.
Who cares if your dog is gay? Maybe it's not that bad.
Yeah well, I can't really afford to play anymore anyway. I'm about out of quarters.
Yeah, and he was out sick yesterday too. Guys...  I think Kenny isn't here because he's at home cheesing.
This whole time your stupid story was just a way to rip on me for being Jewish at Christmas again!
Look, we already have the guy's blog. Maybe we can find an address and check it out on MapQuest.
No ending? Well, we can't animate until we have our voices recorded, so we'd better just record what we have and figure out the ending later. 
You don't pee in the shower, dude, that's fucking disgusting!
Hey! That's it! That dance! I can ask Rebecca to go to the dance!
The new girl liked me, and so you lied to her!
I can't lose another friend. First Kenny and now Stan? All I'm gonna have left are you two douches. 
I know. But just like you, I feel like I have to try. People can really get hurt, and a joke just isn't worth that.
Maybe their baby will be still-born, like Cartman was. 
Wha-? Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You Bastards!
Is that what this is all about?!  You came up with this whole idea so you could get a stupid toy?! 
If you do not accept treatment I will no longer give you money or be your friend. I will not help you kill yourself.
Oh. Ah, we're trying to reach Oculus Customer Service.
Hold on. Ah, I'm, ah... n-not right now. 
Oh my God, this book says that negative and positive are the same thing; that real and not real are one.
Well that does it! If us boys are going to live, we have to get rid of the girls!
When Cartman first opened the door, and saw the Thompsons, he felt bad for playing a joke on them. Now that everything's turned out alright, he's able to laugh.
Jesus Christ, you can't even walk down an aisle to get your candy? 
I can't. My dad grounded me. Wait a minute, where is my dad?
They did it to us again! That dirty talent agency stole our client again!
Dude, Mr. Hankey has magic powers. He can do whatever he wants. 
Stan, you don't get how cool Facebook has become. You can message your friends, play Yahtzee with your friends, even start your own virtual farm and have your friends visit it.
Yeah! I could just say I got my period! It's not like they'll check. I can just say I got my period, 'cause I really will get it someday! It's not really lying, it's just jumping the gun a little.
Well! I hope it lived up to all the hype! You must feel so much better now!
Then we should go to the record company. My dad's a lawyer, dude; he tells me about this stuff all the time.
Well there's nothing you can do, so you just have to be patient.
Dude, you can't do this! How can we be the Avengers without Captain America?
Do you really think your civilization is better than ours?! You people play games by killing animals, and oppress women!
Hey, look!  See Mr. Hankey at the Mall of Nebraska... Wow! We have to go, dude!
Clyde got $3000 from his mom's life insurance
...Mr. Hankey! Hoh, we were so worried! I was waiting up for you and you didn't come, so I thought that-
No, dude, if something happens to him, my parents are gonna blame me.
All right! We're getting the hell out of here! 
Yeah, what's this about? We should be writing our monologues for Smackdown.
Okay, will you let Muhammad come to South Park if we dress him like a pirate?
Dude, I know you're pissed at me right now. You've gotta understand that I did it because I know in my heart that the XBox is better, for all of us.
It's just a marketing ploy by the network. Like that time they had the first male-to-male kiss with Terrance and Phillip?
Mayor! We have the solution to your problem.
Yeah. Just when he was being accepted he has to leave and start over.
Dude, I can't believe we are dealing with this Muhammad thing again.
Well you're NOT crazy. The whale talked to all of us. And he needs our help getting him home.
That was totally gross. She smelled like vitamins and pee.
Well, Tweek's okay, but he's certainly no Kenny! 
Cartman, let me out of this stupid net!!
Hey, uh, does anyone know who that guy is?!
I didn't come to stop you. I... I think you're right, Cartman. I want to help you get the Family Guy episode pulled.
Sometimes I think I can see time slowing down,  and my own existence fading.
I don't need Ike listening to you comment on anything!
Yeah, Jimmy's right. I know we can come up with way better ideas than Craig.
You are not going to go on national television and spew a bunch of hate speech about Jewish people! I won't let you do it, Cartman!
What if we do a show where we-  Uh, no.
Um... so...  So dual citizenship, wow, uh... You know that I, I never knew anyone that had that.
Come on, we have to finish the quest in Stonehaven. 
It's not me! I'm here to help you, fatass!
Hey, Cartman, do you think God's getting mad at you for not making $10 million? 
I can do it. It just got... look, it just doesn't matter, because it's not true.
It's too late, fatass.  They'll be here in less than a minute.
I've been thinking, how did shamelessness get to this?  Did it start with fat people on scooters? Or did the bar get lowered way before that? And then I started thinking, maybe it was us.  I don't know, but maybe somehow, we lowered the bar, a long time ago.  And now we're all sittin' here in the stink of it all.  There's no going back, Stan. 
Phil Collins is playing Lalapalala's, and because we're all doing so well in school now, our parents said they would take us.
If she wants to be with you, how about you have her tell all these people here?
The South loses this battle, Cartman. They lose the war!
Well, yeah, but what if the grampa wants to die, cause he's really old, and he's just asking for help?
Don't let him touch you! You die if he touches you!
Dude, why'd you make that deal? If we're out buying tampons, we'll miss the trailer anyway/
...Dude, you're supposed to vote for Giant Douche.
They're not gonna show that stupid-ass Godzilla movie again, are they?
He didn't even seem like Chef. He seemed like a empty shell of a man.
The water tank?   Hey I'm not going with you!
I knew it! It wasn't because I gave that guy twenty dollars! The homeless all came from here!
Oh dude! Dude, this is the part I was talking about. Check out the bassline on this! 
Ah... Oh Butters,  it'll be all right. Listen, we've all learned that people look for meaning in books. And sometimes, even if it isn't there, they'll try and invent their own meaning.
I didn't do anything to you. Timmy saw the turkey and wanted to get it. What do you want me to say to him?
And, and hey, if for some reason Butters can't go to Casa Bonita, you can take his place.
But, everyone thinks I was responsible for 9/11.
Uh, Timmy, if we back to the other kids with that turkey they're gonna be pissed!
And then we won't have to show anybody the picture Kenny has of you guys sucking each other's jagons.
I thought you said the wonder of Mother Nature was a beautiful thing.
Hm, I wasn't really going for "gay," I was more going for "wholesome."
Come on, Blanket! We gotta go before your dad sees us. 
He talked! I swear to Abraham he talked, and he loves rocket ships!
I just had a couple more questions about-
Ike found out last night. My mom's having sex with the UPS man.
They told us that "Phillip. He's the one with talent. Just get him for Earth Day."
We don't even understand how this game is played.
Because you just said, "here in my room"!
This is so retarded, Cartman. You've got everyone believing your stupid story.
No. They're not a part of your betrayal?
Nope! We're gonna have all the pizza you can eat, twenty different cakes, and Lorde is going to play live!
Well, I mean, all last week you were ripping on ginger kids and now you are one.
The past...four nights we've tried to play, he shows up and kills us!
Don't call Mr. Blaine a gaywad! He's a brilliant man.
Yeah, but dude, he seriously could have died in that fire.
Hey McNuggets. You wanna come play for us?
I'm in big trouble, you guys! We have to do something!
Oh no. Nohoho no. Cartman, don;t you do this! The Middle East is finally at peace!
All right, mister! You better have a good explanation for why you didn't show up to play ball!
Okay, that's enough.  Everybody! Cartman is just pulling one of his stupid tricks on everyone, because he's trying to get out of a deal he made!
I can't deal with it, Stan. I mean, all the stuff I've been reading; I really don't think I exist!
Goodbye, Ike! Be safe! I'll come find you in Nebraska when Mom and Dad are back to normal!
Kenny, aren't you a little young for this?
I knew it! You didn't plan 9/11 and you really didn't shoot that guy!
Well, I have this friend, see? And this friend belongs to a certain, Chosen People of Israel. And it... so happens that these chosen people killed your Lord.
Looks like we're gonna have to go to Arkansas. Come on, guys. We're gonna put a stop to Wall-Mart once and for all!
It's my little brother. He's really changing and I feel like-
Yeah. They're tryin' to scare everybody 'cause they're gay wads.
Hoh! Uh, Rebecca. There's this dance, see, at the school, and um,
It just keeps getting worse. I see stuff from Amazon almost every day. My poor dad has no idea.
Dude, maybe we don't have to rip a tooth out of Kenny's mouth.
No more. No more. Oh, come on, Cartman, no. No more. 
Who's everyone?! Who all is in on this?!
Shh, Blanket, we're gonna take you away for a little while, okay? 
Hey Cartman.  I care a lot about him, too. 
But... they were here. Ah I swear it. Stacks and stacks of ballots from states all over the country!
I went online posing as a boy who would have sex with older men, and told them to meet me here. My plan worked perfectly!  Whoa.
Wait a minute, that thing landed on Kenny, and they took him to the mortuary.
Twenty-two point three years. That's how long it takes for something tragic to become funny.
Don't get scared up in the mountains Cartman.
And so, red hair, light skin, and freckles are all passed down genetically. A child's red hair is not determined by the lack of a soul,  but by the melanins which control the pigment in all of our skins. Thank you. 
Ike, you can't come to school with me. 
These people aren't going to prove anything. To believe any of this you either have to be a liar, or stupid.
He didn't want us for sex, fatass! Something is making him say those things.
Whoa, Cartman. We aren't gonna be hippies anymore. Y-you don't have to kill us.
How are you going to try to get invited to Casa Bonita this time?
Hey, it looks like one of those Etheropians.
Because some people think vaccinations can give you autism or Asperger's!
Dude, this is great! You know all the Stations of the Cross, right, Stan?
I know. I'm almost at the end and there's nothing. 
Dude, you need to snap out of this! So Wendy left you for Token. What are you gonna do? Just be miserable your whole life?
Well, I turned off all my Apple stuff. They can't locate you if you don't have your stuff on, right? 
Yeah. This is like the third day in a row. I wonder what's wrong
No no, he's right! We've gotta make it for someone in need so that people have to go.
We need you to protect us... from a bully.
Hey. Me and Cartman and Kenny are going down to Happy Burger. Do you wanna come?
...star-starting to become alienated from some of your friends.
A band! Holy shit, Stan! Didn't you say your dad knows somebody who knows Lorde?
I can't believe I let you scare me into taking your side. You used fear to make me stop believing in free speech.
Yeah! Timmy's probably back in third grade right now living it up!
Alright, look. I honestly don't know the secret, dude. Only Cartman does, and that's how it's gonna work for us.
Dude! He got Brent Musberger for a leg!
Well if I'm going down, Cartman's going down!
Yeah. And my powerful nunchakus make me into Bunroku , a deadly but compassionate ninja who protects those in trouble.
I'm not going to help you freeze yourself, Cartman! It's a stupid idea!
I know, hunh? Put your mouth against the glass like this.  Waaaaah! 
Sorry, sorry. You know how after we spent the night at Kenny's house and-and you and Cartman got sick with chickenpox?
Dude! How are we gonna move twenty three calves to your house?
I just have a feeling this might be the last time we get to do this.
I have to join Jewleeard and make Grandma proud!  Tell my parents I'll call them. 
I know it's hard to think about, but you have to be strong. Remember how that movie made you feel.
Towelie is a tough choice because,  even though I can see how always having a towel around can come in handy, he's just always so high.
Come on dude, we have to get to practice.
We are raising money so that Chef can hire Johnnie Cochran to sue you!
Good thing we made those changes to the seating.
I didn't come here to talk about The Passion, Cartman!
Yeah. Maybe if we can get higher ratings by the end of the week, they'll let us stay on the air!
"Dear Mommy and Daddy: I am running away. I am sorry, but I can no longer handle the monotony of middle-class life. Everyone at school is a fucking idiot, and if one more person talked to me about that Susan Boyle performance of Les Misérables I was going to puke my balls out through my mouth. I love you all, but I have to move on. I'm going to Somalia to be a-" to be a pirate?! Oh shit!
If we as a people choose not to believe that Jesus is the Son of God, then we can still apologize for the brutal way in which he was killed, and take our share of the responsibility for it.
Who cares? My parents deserve whatever they get. They're liars and cheats.
You made hamburgers? Well that's awesome! I'd love one.  Mmm. Hm, wow  This is really good, Cartman.
Wait!  I brought him! I brought him to show you! 
I'm gonna shove that thing up your ass!
I can't take it anymore! I gotta go volunteer, dude! 
Doctor, this is Muhammad. We want you to clone him, so we can give his copies to gingers, and Barbra Streisand.
So then where did the eight hundred dollars we made from selling an Internet ad to Payless Shoe Source go?
You see? Nothing, dude. Just a bunch of stars.
Yeah. We've come to complain. We don't want a Wall-Mart in our town.
Where's all the cool costumes and jumping off ropes and stuff?!
Nothing. Um , my period is really uuuh...  Uuuh, my period is going swimmingly.
Why are they all out driving at the same time?
Dude, nobody gives a crap about who your stupid father is! Muhammad is an important issue with actual ethical ramifications!
You won't get more votes than us, asshole!
I don't want to kill myself. They rigged this thing to fill with water! 
Yeah, that's why we wanna have a startup company.
Aw, that's just a rumor. They don't really track y- 
Beause he's a fat racist self-centered intolerant manipulating sociopath!
I do not sound like Cartman goddamnit!  Okay, so, see ya. 
"The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few?" That was Wrath of Khan.
Yeah. We're guys, dude. We find something about all our friends to rip on. We made fun of you for being rich just like we make fun of Butters for being wimpy.
No, it's Cartman. Something's really wrong with him. 
Well, look at it this way: statistically speaking, we're safer inside a car with an old person driving than outside.
Dude! Timmy's chair is packed with all that stuff! We've gotta help him!
Don't worry, you guys. He forgot about Kenny. Kenny will help us.
Because I-  I... Um... because I think... they are real. It's all real. Think about it. Haven't Luke Skywalker and Santa Claus affected your lives more than most real people in this room? I mean, whether Jesus is real or not, he... he's had a bigger impact on the world than any of us have. And the same could be said of Bugs Bunny and, a-and Superman and Harry Potter. They've changed my life, changed the way I act on the Earth. Doesn't that make them kind of "real." They might be imaginary, but, but they're more important than most of us here. And they're all gonna be around long after we're dead. So in a way, those things are more realer than any of us. 
Wha?! Well wait, ahah I wanna see what happens here!
Yeah, but, why can't XBox automatically let you pre-order Metal Gear Solid V?
Can someone help us? My little brother fell out of a window. 
Hey! I'm doing it to save little baby cows. I'm not gonna stop eating meat altogether.
Did you guys ever see that one Brady Bunch where the guy... 
Oh yeah. Tom Cruise does have Seaman on his back.
We don't know. They lost all contact with him.
Yeah, look what you're doing to this poor kid.
We got six days to make it to Los Angeles. If we keep our stops to a minimum, we should be able to get the episode pulled just in time.
Ooogh. Dude, the thing is, we're not the ones that made them crack babies. That's their moms' goddamned fault!
Get up, Cartman! You're still not staying on long enough! 
Come on, Tweek! He's only got one arm!
Okay. since my dad's a lawyer, he says we can use any of his books we want.  Who wants to read them? 
Well, what's the point? Jimmy always wins with his stand-up comedy.
You're saging these games do this on purpose?!
This isn't a joke, Cartman! You have to believe me, officer. The outcome of the election depends on it.
No, I'm not there. I'm at a hospital. I I'm hearing you in my imagination.
Rebecca, there's this dance, see, the South Park Elementary Bay Of Pigs Memorial Dance, and uh, now I was wondering, ih-ih-ih if you wanna go.
No, uh-I knew it! I knew it. I was just testing you guys. You just wait till I get to that Chinpokomon camp! I'm gonna be the toughest master of them all! So we'll see you there, a-ight? 
I'll die if I do swim in it!
I don't know what the hell to do. The whole world's gone crazy.
Excuse me.  Do you know which way the network president's office is?
Nuh, it's more important than that. Our school is putting on a big show for Earth Day, and we promised people we could get you to perform.
That's not true. Kids at school like us. Don't they?
You can't just roll into places and take people's lives away!
There can't be that many pet stores in South Park, dude. 
Well, actually, Cartman's getting a nurection. But then, we're gonna give it you. Sooo, buck up! 
You can't believe it?? He does this shit all the time!
I know! It's so much worse than Catcher in the retarded Rye!
He did not say that! You just want him dead so you can have his stupid PSP!
Why the hell would you want three copies of the same movie?
Alright, so did everyone settle on their wrestling names?
Hey... Hey, we know a place! We know a place where everything is just happiness and joy. And no humans are there to mess it up.
Would you excuse us for a second?  You just can't expect me to sit there and say nothing. No, Ike, I'm supposed to be looking out for you. So what? I wasn't going to just blurt it out, I was gonna use some tact, but you won't even let me... What? Uh uh! Stop right there, Ike!  Mom, I think maybe you should talk to Ike about love and sex!
With his power, I can finally make the earth a better place for the Jews!
Well how come Kenny's family eats frozen waffles for dinner and has rats on the floor, and we have a big house and lots of food?
Sure!
I have a little dreidel; I made it out of clay.
And when it's dry and ready, with dreidel I shall- everybody!
Butters, you know goddamned well you didn't write that book!
Get ready guys. Whoever is in here is the kid that's hacking our e-mails and phone calls! You guys ready?!
City kids get to go to museums for field trips. We get cow farms.
I don't know, dude. It's like everyone's putting pieces together that aren't there.
Because then you can pay us to use our friend in commercials.
You know, I think we all learned something today. It's fine to have your own beliefs and your own traditions, but as soon as you start excluding people from your ways, only because of their race, you become separatists. And being a separatist sucks ass.
Wendy, I just wanna get an A, okay? Let's not make this any more confusing than it already is. &lt;&gt;
All right. Come on you guys, we have to get back home. 
I think Clyde is kind of cool, but Craig is definitely cooler than Clyde.
The kindergarten teacher is having sex with my little brother.
Guess what? You're not my best friend anymore! Cartman's my new best friend!
No, see? There's people of all colors. And they added a black guy as one of the hangers, too, so it's not racist.
Dude, where are we going to find a pumpkin to carve?
Then we'll wait, because we have to clone Muhammad now!
I wonder how come Cartman's not in school today?
Wouldn't it be better to just agree with him and forget the whole thing?
I TIVO every episode. We can go to my house and see what they did.
Then I guess I'll see you on Black Friday.
Dude, there's a guy with a gun here!
Yeah, it was cool, thanks.  Um, so... Is there any way you'd
Do you think we did a good thing, Stan?  I mean, no one even seemed to notice.
Oh, stop it, Cartman! You didn't learn anything! Not a God-damned thing!
Anyway, that will give me plenty of time playing video games.
Get the bull in the balls with a snowball.
That's it Cartman, I'm outta here!  Chatroulette is no way for me to find new friends! 
The girls do not have a device that shows them the future Cartman. That's retarded.
Mr. Hankey? Mr. Hankey, is that you? Hello?
What are we gonna do, Stan? It's, it's not like we can change the way an entire country thinks. I don't like it, but it's just the way they are.
I wish that was good enough, but if you censor out Mohammad, then soon you'll have to censor out more.
Whoa! They gave you an anal probe Cartman?
I wanted to get Ike out of his room, so I invited all his friends over for a slumber party to play Dragon Age: Inquisition.
Ooh, who the hell cares? He's not even my responsibility.
What?! You said we had plenty of money, Cartman!
I am sooo sick of that stupid bitch! Blabbin' pussy little skank! Why do people talk on their phone like that?! I can't even get a minute of piece before that bitch walks in, holding the cell phone out like this , and talking on speaker phone! Nobody wants to hear your goddamned conversations, you little bitch! You're not that important!
Pot's illegal too, but people still manage to find it. Ever since that first time Kenny cheesed, he hasn't been the same. You've all noticed the change in him. I'll bet Kenny's at home cheesing right now.
Uh…yeah…we want to crossbreed an elephant with a pig.
Dude, look at Bebe.  Something seems different about her.
Jimmy, exactly what part of the fishsticks joke did Cartman write?
No, I mean, this is impossible, Stan! Cartman is the biggest asshole in the world! How is it that God gives him a million dollars?
(No! That's not what I said! Vanilla paste!)
Okay, then let's take him to the hospital. You hear that, fatso!  You're goin' to the hospital!
Yeah, yeah, that's cool. Bring the left titty out some more.  Yeah, yeah freeze there. 
Wait a minute. There's only four of us.
Butters, do you really think it's fair to lie like this?! Let me tell you, if you don't have the-
It's unbelievable, Stan. EA Sports just used us the entire time. We worked for nothing and EA made all the money. You know, I don't think we actually deserved getting screwed over but, but I guess making tons of money off of people who are making nothing is always gonna cause problems. I know, I know, right? We might've got screwed, but the really tragic thing is that those, those poor crack babies at the hospitals are just gonna be stuck there, with nowhere to go.  No way!  This is it!
Cartman, you hike me the ball, then somebody run, and I'll throw it at something. Ready?!
Ah, I don't know, it just feels like... there's got to be something else going on here.
Cartman! What kind of stupid-ass question is that?! Of course it was fun!
Well, I fell down this ice cavern,  and I saw this block of ice, so I told my friend to throw a rope- 
All I wanted was to play one level of Call of Duty and you know what Ike told me? He said the living room was for old people.
Yeah. See, we got you to fight just 'cause we wanted to see who was the toughest. We made up all that stuff we said to get you guys mad at each other. 
There's not gonna be any robot guards, retard! Just get Kenny! 
Hey!  How about you come to school with me tomorrow, so I can at least prove I'm not crazy to my friends.
Uh... W-uh... but... Come o- come on! Really? I mean, aren't there more important things going on right now?
What? Y-you want me to hang out with you?
I didn't feel comfortable in that stuff, dude. I'm just being me.
You guys wanna see how long I can hold my breath under water?
I'm stoked my cousin is comin' to live with us. It'll be just like having a brother. 
Cartman, he's got everyone on Sony's side. We can't stop him!
How, how long do we have to take the shuttle?
This was supposed to be my story! My coming to terms with a guilty conscience! This isn't fair!
What's the matter, Mr. Hankey? Are you sick?
Be a good boy? You know all about this?
You're right, Stan. My Grandma isn't floating around, judging me and watching what I do. She's dead. Dead and gone forever.
That people shouldn't sue each other all the time.
This whole time your TV is in a house with nobody in it?!
Don't panic. I'll tell you what to say.  You can tell them...
Jesus Christ! They can bat themselves out!  Our whole summer, dude. We have to play this boring game all summer long.
He does kind of look like him dude. And Kenny thinks Cartman's Gordon Ramsay impersonation is really good.
Jimmy, you're got to explain to the Germans that this is your fault, not ours!
It was him, dude. I told you, it was Mr. Hankey!
Well, I had to see it to believe it!
Can we please just try and talk to him?
It's about time, Kenny! Did you bring the pumpkin?
Oh Jesus Christ, I had to see it to believe it! What the hell are you doing?!
Dammit, Cartman, you are such a fat fuck!
You threw it away, Cartman! It's mine now.
Chef, the police are asking questions about you!
Yeah, this all happened the day after he went to that concert!
Hey yeah, what about poor McNuggets? What's he gonna do now?
Yeah, I hope they protest TV shows forever.
Cartman farted in there! We had to breath it in for 20 hours!
You guys, we can't let him do this!
Aww, come on, you guys! It's supposed to be really cool.
Nobody wants any of your stuff, you fat bitch!
He was very brave. He risked his life so that Mephesto could live.
You said we have no idea that you're never let us hurt Wall-Mart!
We made it! It hasn't gone to commercials yet. 
Ot- Nice to meet you, Cartman. Yuh you know, I saw that same jacket you're wearing at Bosco's for $29.95. How much was yours? Um, I juh- I was just wondering if Bosco's is a ripoff?
Don't you get it?! You can't have any Trapper Keepers, fat ass!
I see... a man... with a baseball cap.  He's killing now... Oh! I'm seeing it all flash before my eyes! The guy's name is Michael Deets, and he lives at 621 Castillo Street. He's usually there between seven and eleven p.m.
This is serious. They've been going out for almost two weeks now.
Gone are the dark clouds that had me-
Don't you remember? That time we were out hunting with your uncle Jimbo and Ned.
Alright, fine!  You're the spokesman, Cartman! But you'd better not screw it up!
Well. Dude, it's uh it's good to have you back.
We have to find Red and Green Mega Man for Cartman's birthday party.
Don't worry. We'll do this quick, okay? Just hang on, Mr. Hankey, just hang on!
I'm sorry Token, I had to tell him. His life is in danger.
Yeah, I think they already moved in. I saw moving vans in their driveway two days ago.
Dude, we can't do a presentation on underpants gnomes. Mr. Garrison will fail us because you're making it up.
We d-didn't think it was that big a deal.
Dude, that would have to be like, the best party ever.
NO, why the hell would you keep eating something that made you crap blood?!
Our band can't find a stylistic direction to go in. We need to go down to the mall to buy hundreds of CDs to listen to so we can define our sound.
But what about Mr. Garrison? He can't go back.
So where are students getting all this cough medicine??  This surveillance footage shows a group of troubled kids getting all the smack they want from a pharmacist!  Sexy Action School News reported the pharmacist to the South Park police, and he was immediately arrested! 
Oh my God... their pitcher was able to hit him right on the bat.
Oh, you can pretend all you want! You're not fooling anybody!
Oh. Well, I certainly don't want you to feel that "Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly on the Table" is holding you back. 
Well, ah I mean, we have to accept that we have a problem, and put the blame completely on ourselves. I mean, maybe this isn't really even a disease. 
Hey, Jesus! Ih-if you win the fight, can you turn Kenny back to normal?
Wait, wai- I can't let this happen.  Butters.
Let's do this together, dude.  Our only shot at playing any next-gen console is by teaming up. If you wanna game on a PS4, then I do too.
He's going to kindergarten because he's a genius!
God-damnit, we need to get to the new Prime Minister! NOW!
We'll just have to keep throwing jabs to win the fight.
Our little man is growing up, Stan. He's growing up.
Ah, look, Phillip. Everyone in South Park just wants to see your serious side.
It's still stupid and now I paid 49 cents for it!
...No, dude, it really isn't cool. You all turned your backs on me. You're supposed to be my best friends and you just... treated me like nothing! And now you all expect me to just forget it all and, and hang out with you again like nothing happened?
Dude, why the hell would you DO that?!
That if he could prove leprechauns exist, I would suck his balls.
I looked on the known species webpage. There's no animal called a 'Jewpacabra' mentioned anywhere.
All right. Butters, go get next to her.
Gosh, I hope he doesn't cut me with his celery hand. 
Let's all try to help a little, 'cause 
I know that I'll have to testify, that I'll have to... relive what I saw that day.  But I can't let Spielberg and Lucas get away with it. Not this time. Even if I have to do it alone.
Dude! What if Cartman really does succeed? And we really do have to be his slaves??
Your husband.  He wanted that pie badly, but he knew that he was not allowed to eat it yet.
Well, he is. It turns out that the bookmobile driver here was the one making love to chickens.
No way! You wanna go with us so you can betray us at some point and keep us from destroying the Wall-Mart.
Holy crap, dude!  Hey look! He's got ice cream! 
How do you know? You weren't even there.
They kind of look like us.  I mean, Stan's got blue eyes and I've got a sharper nose, but I mean, they kinda look like us.
And then we ran out of the Kum & Go and these guys, th-they took our friend.
See, w-we're the official presidents of the Terrance and Phillip Fan Club. A- and... we're... going to see them tomorrow 'cause we can get them to perform at the Earth Day festival.
Oh please, no reason! I got AIDS from him!
Sally Struthers, dude. She used to be on Full House.
Come on, Cartman! How much do you wanna bet the South doesn't win?!
Sorry Ms. Cartman, but your son took some things that didn't belong to him.
Please Dad, I've been looking forward to this all week. Aaand it's me and Ike's bonding time. Really. This is good for our relationship.
And that applies to all of us, doesn't it? Even though it's convenient to have things done for you, sometimes it's best to deal with it yourself. 
Nope. We wanna show the world how healthy your food is. Our fat friend here is going to lose forty pounds eating at Shitty Wok.
Okay. We've got $15 between us. That means we get nine balls to throw.
Oh geez. Maybe we let this thing get out of hand. This issue is so complicated, but... m-maybe we sh-should just let Kenny go in peace.
We're missing out on some quality video game time right now.
Well, you have to help him, just like I have to help my dad.
Well Token was a definite winner for talent show. But then we decided to take everyone to a baseball game, to see how we got along there.
Of course, the sewer! That must be where he is. Come on!  Come on!
You said "fuck you" to my face, Stan.
Dude, some people really do consider this obscene.
That's it!  I don't care about the fate of the world! Screw it!
Ih it sure is quiet up here in the mountains and it's dry, too. Do you have a humidi-humidifier?
Ya see Ike? There's nothing. There's nothing for you to be afraid of.
Well, Ike. You can tell Cartman that it's my triangle!
No you're not!  I read the brochure, Cartman! If you're under eighteen, you have to have a parent with you to sign up for the Special Olympics.
Then don't eat 14 Egg waffles for lunch, fatass!
It's funny that something that should be completely private is put up on a Web site for everyone to see??
It's hard to be a Jew on Christmas
My friends won't let me join in any games
And I can't sing Christmas songs or decorate a Christmas tree
or leave water out for Rudolph 'cause there's something wrong with me
My people don't believe in Jesus Christ's divinity
I'm a Jew
A lonely Jew
On Christmas
Channukah is nice, but why is it
That Santa passes over my house every year?
And instead of eating ham I have to eat kosher latke
Instead of Silent Night I'm singing huhash dogavish
And what the fuck is up with lighting all these fucking candles, tell me please?
I'm a Jew
A lonely Jew
I'd be merry
But I'm Hebrew
On Christ-maas
Well look, if being around lots of cash negatively affects the HIV, then maybe...
Cartman, we should probably talk about our chances.
Yeah, fatass, we're gonna dig up-  Dig up Kyle's dead grandma??
Listen, this is all you need to know: the economy is not a supernatural all-knowing entity. The economy is just an idea, made up by people, thousands of years ago. The economy is not real. And yet, it is real. Nowadays they'll give credit to practically anyone who applies for them.  I applied for this yesterday to prove a point. It is an American Express Platinum card.  It has no spending limit.  Do not be afraid! This is only plastic. It's just something made up by people. Truly meaningless until we put our faith in it. Faith is what makes an economy exist. Without faith, it is only plastic cards and paper money.
Yeah, you are! You always get in trouble
That's how God is! And if Pharaoh doesn't give us what we want, next he's gonna kill all Egyptian first born boys!
But it's our game. We bought it together.
Oh well, at least as president you can run the school the way you want.
There's a lot of holes in the Theory of Evolution too; it doesn't mean it's wrong.
I can't, Mom. We're working on our school project.
They knew that staying at Kenny's house would get us sick, and they made us do it anyway.
Dude, my mom and dad keep fighting all the time. And both of them say it's because my dad doesn't have a nurection. So I want to get him one.  Damn it! What the hell is wrong with everybody? 
Hey Blanket. Uh, look, we're goin' over to help my dad chop wood. You... wanna come with?
When I say "go," you slam your electric wheelchair into high gear. Okay, Timmy?
I don't care! You're not making me wait in the van again!
Okay, fine, Butters. But if you're gonna hang out with us, you have to play like Lord of the Rings. 
Listen, doucher! Our parents are gonna kill us, and you, if they found out that we bought these!
Aw, come on Dad, don't be such a Jew!
And if I had just one wish, just one wish in the whole world,
If I had one wish it'd be for Cuba to change.
Because I think that all the Cubans are in pain
All the joy in the world, from sea to shining sea
Doesn't mean a thing if Cubans aren't free
I just can't be very happy, that's certain
Not as long as your Cubans are hurtin' 
Oh, won't you search your soul and find a way to change your mind?
That is my one and only wish.
The odds on a single number in roulette are thirty-five to one.  That means, with a ten thousand dollar bet, you win three hundred and fifty thousand.
Dad! Somebody's at the front door!  Well am I grounded or not?!  Ugh. Fine! I'll get it! 
Hey, Kenny. How much for you to eat this?
Cartman!! Wake up you fat piece of crap!! 
What's this comforter filled with? Um, it isn't filled with down, is it?
But that's all that matter now! It's just all ... and the new celebrity?
Oh, Jesus, this bus is going fast!  Oh, I did it again!!
Oh, yeah. Yeh-yeah. It's a-it's not even noticeable. 
Is that why there's crap on my doorstep every morning?
All right, you see, Clyde. Okay, we wanna help him sue whoever invented the toilet.
It's Mr. Hankey! He hasn't shown up yet.
We understand you just sounded like a freakin' racist!
I'm not from Jersey. I was born here.
Well why don't you just tell people the truth?!
All right, let's see.  Dammit Kenny, that's not what she said!
Then I can give it to my dad. 
Stan, this has gone too far. People are going to get hurt. What you started is way out of control.
No, Mom-uh, he, he doesn't want you kissing him. 
Dude, when he gets out he's gonna be really mad!
Wait!  I may not have Santa, but I do have Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo.
See? I told you, dude. Those are dialysis machines.  Old people have to hook themselves into it with a tube, and it sucks all their body fluids out.
Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo
he loves me and I love y-
Knock it off! Right now! This isn't funny! At all!
You see? And then I can take all my homework on my iPad, and swipe it over to my iPhone.
Hey, what happens to me in the future?
No. And I don't want to. Look Stan, maybe we should fo- 
That's 15 people we got to agree to come see David Blaine perform in Denver.
Heheh, we could make you say whatever we wanted.
Okay. Today's word is "spirituality." What that means to me is uh- 
Craig, if Cartman didn't do anything, then he doesn't deserve any of the credit!
Okay. Here we go.  Hey! That was right on target.
Just let it go, dude. You only had sixteen dollars and twelve cents. Count all your losses and move on. He's smarter than you.
Dude. I don't know if I'm going to like the new Eric Cartman.
Cartman? Come on, dude. You have to get up.
Yeah, I don't even know if I'm gonna watch it anymore.
If you knew something, but, you couldn't tell anyone, what... what would you do?
(I can't take it! I want out right now!)
You know what I like best about you? You don't say, "hella," like our Cartman does. I swear, if he says that one more time, I'm gonna kill him! 
God dammit, Cartman! You can't keep making up new powers!
But if I stop now, I'll just be going with the group again. So, to be an individual, I have to bomb Pearl Harbor. See ya. 
Well, I was just digging around, and I was all like, 'dude, I found this triangle' and my friends were like, 'dude' and I was all like 'dude.'
Not Cartman, he gets to be on TV anyway.
Dude, everyone's leaving! We can walk right up to the tank and really study him.
You guys go tell Butters to start making the cutoouts. I'm gonna go tell Mr. Hankey the good news!
How? How could the Jews do that to Jesus?
Yeah, but Cyborg Bill is totally gay now. Please Mom? Everybody else has Chinpokomon.
In there! Let's go!  Get this jamb on the door! 
I just think I'd rather... control it instead of blame it on anything.
We spent all afternoon learning about how we aren't actually happy. I had no idea how unhappy I was until today. They gave me this cool book to read, and I'm already on chapter four....
Ike, Ike, you have to be honest. Am I ugly, yes or no?  You ALL think I'm ugly. Jesus Christ, the least you could have done is told me!
It's hopeless, dude! Butters must have made it to the hospital. By now our parents probably know we were playing with weapons! We have to get rid of the evidence! 
I know. It's like we have the outdoors back again.
Look guys, all we need to do is split up and apply some good diversion tactics. We'll use the Texans' emotions against them.
Uuuh. Well, the truth is, we didn't write that paper last time. 
Man, it's really starting to snow.  I hope they don't close the roads.
What the hell did you do that for, Kenny?!
Stop wasting the tacos on your hand, Cartman!
Yeah. Good job, wizard fat ass! Now we're totally lost.
I don't want to! It's a stupid name! 
No, Butters. Look what it's done to you. It's made you even lamer than before.
...And when she moved up and down, the little fetus jiggled.
What if they don't show the Terrance & Phillip trailer at all? What if we went through all of this for nothing?
To City Wok so we can make our money. God!
Butters! We said you can't watch it! We have a quest!
Cartman?  He's not gonna open it. Break it down.
All that time and effort we spent helping Token and this is the thanks we get?!
Disposing of the doll wouldn't be easy. He would have had to have brought a shovel to decapitate it.
Well, because, we don't really... believe in Jesus.
He was a McCain supporter.  It's okay, Ike. Obama will do fine.
Dad, if you agree to something but you didn't mean to agree to it, what do you do?!
No it's not cool!  My mom won't let me keep him in the house.  She says he's too big, and that his poop is bigger than our couch.
You get a platinum album for selling one million copies, you fat turd!
And so, thirty percent of the money we make off the licensing agreement with EA Sports goes to the orphanage for the needy crack babies. Did you see the blueprints? The babies will have their own putt putt golf course.  Why does it matter how much I'm making, Stan? If the crack babies are getting a place to grow and develop, why does my salary matter?
This is where the elders meet. Nobody is allowed to go in there when they're having a meeting.
Jambu! Jambu, why didn't you speak up before?
Yeah. We have a report to do, asshole! Get up! Get up!! 
You don't get sucked into it! You don't get sucked in at all! Plehehehehehehehese!
This is sweet, being rugged outdoorsmen.  Facing the wilderness, not having to be home until 8:30,... 
Cartman? Your side won, dude. Why are you so sad?
Ungh, I can't find the word "queef" anywhere! 
Ike, I just want us to be friends again.
Mr. Garrison, seriously, I have to go. Can I please be excused from class?
Oh well, I I grew up in the shity, ah ah I really don't care for it. Ah I come from a Jewish family, which of course you already know, because Kyle's from the same family.  I like to read, and I have these polyps on the backs of my hands - I don't know what they are.
Well? Now what are we going to do?
Hi. We were wondering why fatass  I mean, Cartman, hasn't been showing up for school.
...Alright, that does it!  This has been bothering the hell out of me!  I knew it! You're not Cartman at all!
Okay so, what exactly are we doing now?
No way, dude, then I'd have to suck Cartman's balls
Mom, Dad, can I go with the guys to see the Raging Pussies?
Look, he knows full well what he's doing, and he's just waiting for us to buy into it, and then he'll laugh and point at our faces and say, "Haha, I got you guys to believe me!" "You guys are stupid!"
Stan, I don't like Wendy.  All I cared about was getting an A in this stupid project!
Yeah dude, we made you your own Facebook page. 
Dude, we have got to get that kid away from him!
If she holds his hand in that theater it'll be all over.
Come on Eric, we can go play at the bus stop.
And you don't see a problem with that?
No, I'm serious! I wanna see what's happening downstairs, so let's just do it! 
You'd better!  Dad, can't we talk to this new Canadian Prime Minister? Iif he knew the situation, he might e-
We promised each other we would never do that, remember?
We heard that you might be teaching Minecraft to adults.
...And in conclusion, the Latino community has provided America, and indeed, the entire world with innovations that we would be lost without. And that is my presentation on the role of Hispanics in American technology. Thank you. 
It says you gotta check it for holes or tears.
Yeah. I bet they could make a fake set of balls. Come on, Butters!
I don't think Mr. Jefferson pays enough attention to his son to notice. Come on! 
Cartman, you go ahead and do the commercial tomorrow. But I'm warning you, those anti-smoking people are liars and they're bullies who will stop at nothing to get what they want, and that means they're dangerous. 
No matter what we think, it's not just a passing trend. We need to realize that the new generation of entertainment is here.  And I, think that's great.
The thing is, Ms. Claridge, we did a lot of stupid things when we were kids.
They'd better be done with the book reports! School starts in 15 minutes!
No, what marches in, crawls up your leg and bites the inside of your ass?
They said we have to give them money that we make on the Internet.
Oh shut up Cartman! You don't even know what you're talking about!
Yeah, fatass, it has to be real to be scary!
Cool! We'll see what we can find, ma'am.
Butters, you have to tell us what Cartman is up to!
Hey, come back! We didn't even get to do our play. 
Yeah!  I was just hanging out in my room, and then I perioded all over the place.
They're TV dinners. Don't you wanna take that veil off so you can eat?
Sssoo aside from all the bull crap, what do ya think of the Oculus?
Here! Here! Look at this. It says "The succubus enchants its victim with an eerie melody. This is the Succubi power. Only playing this melody backwards can vanquish the succubus power."
Hey Stan, now that Terrance & Phillip has been taken off the air, what are we going to do for entertainment?
Just let it go with your fucking balls, you fucking asshole!! Your friends have been in danger and all you care about it this stupid bet! Well I've decided, Cartman, even if we had a bet, that I am never sucking your balls,  you got that?! They can throw me in jail for the rest of my life, but I am  never going to suck your balls,  never! So  there!
Oh, thanks.  Dude, that new girl's into me!
Now, that's what I call a sticky situation. 
All right. Thanks a lot for helping us, dude.
Dude, because! You have to stand up for yourself! So will you fight him? 
Huh, Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastard! 
Nuh uh! It's "Whoever denied it, supplied it!"
Hey! What the hell are you doing inside my little brother?!
Rebecca, in public school,  we select our... own mate.  In public school, men and women get together. Make each other happy.
Oh no, I d- I don't want to be a bother, I uh-
We came on our own 'cause our friend's purity ring is killing him.
"No, no, please! This time I swear I won't make albums or movies."
You guys, I feel kinda bad for that kid.
They said that Chef works in one of these buildings 
But it's... it's not true they... have no souls. 
Well, sorry's not good enough! What are you gonna do about it?
Well, a lot of people like Family Guy too! Who are you to decide it shouldn't be on the air?!
Calm down Butters! The men are taking action. But we need to take your picture.
Light is a wave unless it's observed? That means all matter is just a wave.  Nothing's real! Reality in a nuh- Oh God, it's happening! 
We're not letting you back in the band, Cartman! Fuck off!
Trent Boyett will do it. He's the toughest, baddest kid in preschool! 
And you! You should be ashamed of yourself! Don't you understand that us males are defined by our firemen?!
Vi, Visitors, this morning you took my little brother, Ike. He's the little freckled kid that looks like a football. At first, I was happy you took him away. But I've learned something today. That having a little brother... is a pretty special thing.
No dude, screw that! Jimmy, if Cartman didn't write the joke, then definitely don't sign any patent papers with him! Just say "Cartman, you didn't have anything to do with this joke and you know it!"
Wait a minute. I though your father was your mother 'cause she had a penis.
Oh God! It wasn't thirty, it was one! He jumped over one homeless person with his stupid skateboard, and he barely made it over that guy!
You spent $10 and eight hours to unlock a stadium?
You saw it in The Thing and you're wasting everyone's time!
Hang on.  Hold on a second.  I gues... I... guess... this is... goodbye, Willzy-x.  I'm gonna miss you.  Hey, don't forget me, okay? I won't forget you. 
Revamp how? The rules are that the fourth grade class has to perform the Helen Keller Story.
I'm declaring Shenanigans on you! This game is rigged!
They all laugh at me!  And the girls giggle behind my back!  unable to even glance at my disfigured face.
Oh, dude, I feel so much better about being Jewish now that I see that Mel Gibson is just a big wacko douche. 
Ike, that is enough! If you're interested in Call of Duty, go play it downstairs in the living room!
Dude, I don't think 8-year olds are supposed to take hormones.
What the hell are you doing telling people that we're a gay couple?!
But why are you making such strange laws??
So is it a coincidence that Grandma DID talk to me about going to Jewleeard someday?
Dude, they don't care we knocked Butters' eye out with weapons?
Hey, we should start our own Cirque du Cheville.
All I'm saying is that it's gonna take a lot of singing to make up for that!
You can't! Poor Ike must be so scared, up there all alone. You gotta help me, dude! 
Get out of my way or I'll kick your ass!
You yourself led the campaign against the colorization of films. You understand why films shouldn't be changed.
Chop off his wee wee?! Are you sure?!
...Kenny, will you tell Cartman to shut up?
Yeah, but you know, I've learned something today. It would have been wrong to exploit Butters' weight loss. Because then lots of fat people would have believed it. And then gone and eaten a ton of Chinese food instead of dieting properly. They'd still be fat and, we'd be responsible for their shattered dreams.
Oh. Then what the hell are we talking to you for? Come on, guys.  Hi, are you Elton John?
It's true.  He doesn't care what faith you are.
Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo
he loves me and I love you
Therefore, vicariously he loves you
Even if-
We should not be wasting time and money making sure Cartman's fat scooter can't be tipped over!
Why would the government want people to believe they caused 9/11?
Wait. Isn't there some rule about not getting into cars with strnagers?
Your mom... uses Chipotlaway... to clean blood stains... out of your underwear?
We put a stop to it, until YOU taught them Minecraft.
God-dammit! Come on, we can go watch it at my house!
Look. You guys built a machine together that can bend time. If you'll just agree with him, you can build another one and usher in a whole new era of science!
Seriously, Cartman. You could make money with these!
Heck yeah I'll visit your farm! You should check mine out too!
Why's your sister so mean to you dude?
He won't listen to us, but he would listen to- Gordon Ramsay.
Yeah, fatass! Get your fat butt on the sled!
She did, but now they're saying we have to start going back to school anyways. It's totally gay.
Goddammit, Chef isn't like that! Something funny is going on around here!
Cartman, there are people in the world who really have Tourette's Syndrome. This isn't funny!
I think if we try Kenny's neighborhood, we might find a- 
Well, do you also do other surgeries like that?
Oh, you are so full of crap, Cartman! Metal spikes will not come out!
Nobody else is going to help him, you guys. We've got a chance to do something pretty special here. Are you with us?
Chef, there's a new kid in school, and he's a total weirdo freak.
Cartman, you dumbass! You can't get a new one!
Yeah, now what are we supposed to do?
Hey! We should buy Ms. Ellen Valentine's Day presents. 
Is it cold in here? I realize we're in the mountains, but do we have to freeze to death?
Yes, yes, hello? Is this Mr. Su-gi-yama with the Japanese space program?  How much to take a whale into space?  Nu-no, we don't want you to eat the whale, we want you to send it to the moon. How much? Jesus Christ! Uh hang on.  Hello? Jimmy, any luck at the Chinese Embassy?
Dad? Don't you think our last new house is big enough?
You'll never turn ME into a metrosexual! I like being a dirty, filthy little boy!
Come on, hurry. I bet we can get to level 29! 
Thanks for seeing us, sir. My friend is really worried about his dad.
Hey, you know, that nurse is actually pretty cool.
How can they let an eight-year-old decide Kenny's fate?
Mr. Jackson, please, you're causing a lot of problems.
Well, you're not gonna last down here either, Mr. Hankey. Now, come on! I'm not gonna let you die!
How can I not be nervous? Trying out for the All-State team has been my dream for years.
Dude, what the hell is going on?! Why did they replace Phillip?
Nothing. But the guys said if I don't confess my sins and eat crackers, I'm gonna go to hell.
Ike, I don't know what to do. All the guys are getting their periods, and I don't think I am. I can't be the last one to get it. I just can't!
I guess we should all realize...  that history and alien technology really do go hand in hand. 
My God-damned little brother's trying to follow me to school, again!
But I feel like a basketball player. That's all I wanna do. 
That's not how a croc sounds, you fatass penis!
That's it!  You're not getting high again until we have our Okama GameSphere back!
...Excuse me, I have to step out for a minute. 
Dude, it's Cartman. He's just being a dumb-ass like always.
Jews do NOT carry gold in a little bag around their necks.Cartman! Stop playing around!
Yeah. Then it cancels out the gay polarity.
Hyeh. Yeah. Mung isn't even a word! We made it up! 
What happened? Aren't you still wallowing in pain?
And Stan for being in love with Wendy.
But we certainly want to thank you for all your hard work and attempts at being our friend, lame as they were.
Because I saw you. Okay? In your room, passed out, with a VR headset on. Customer Service said that one of us needed to put on the headset and come get you, and that's why I'm here.
Ike, please. I know your first love seems like the only love, but trust me, it's not. You have so much life ahead of you. 
I'm not inviting you, Cartman. You can't go.
Maybe we need to make students think they have to watch our news show or they'll die.
It's not cool! Ike isn't old enough to understand.
Why don't you take it to one of those pawn places? Every two blocks you see a guy with a sign that says "Cash For Gold and Jewelry." There must be a lot of people doin' it.
I hate picture day at school! It's always some gay-ass photographer with some gay-ass backdrop of New England!
Eh... hey, Cartman?  You really don't care that you can't go?
We said we wouldn't be a part of this fad and look at you!
Your grandma left it to you! You didn't earn it!
All right, fine. I'll do the dumb test.
Eh now,  come on, you guys, we can't take this decision lightly. Whoever we pick is going to be the person we do everything with from now on.
Don't you "Oh, brother" me! She's the woman of my dreams!
...But you can't melt ice with a cool song, 'tardheart.
Stan, it's over. You have to admit what you did so our parents could help us! 
We still have an hour before the costume contest, so let's hit the house on the uh-
Hey Texans! Let me through; we want a treaty!
Don't listen to 'em, Cartman! I'm sure it'll work. Go for it. Yaaay, Cartman! Fly, fly, fly!
Well, you guys can do what you want! I'm going down to that church to confess my sins and eat crackers! And I'm taking Ike with me! 
Do you think kids in every town have to deal with this crap?
Oh God, what have I done?!  I'm sorry. Please, I don't wanna be the vessel for the Antichrist.
Dr. Biber said he can give me a negroplasty so I can finally look the way I've always wanted. He even took my picture and then did computer imaging to show what I would look like after the surgery. 
Dude! Our parents sent us over there to get us sick!
Kenny, we know you really like this girl, but...
Dude, everyone's trying to figure out who you are.
You know why! Because we're trying to keep our parents from watching murder porn!
Dear Mr. Castro:  I am an eight-year-old American boy who lives in South Park.
He is working for the Wall-Mart to stop us from succeeding!
I can't take it anymore.  Why do people say "long story short"? They're not making it short, Stan.
Pleahehese! My farm hasn't expanded in three days!
I'm going to the kitchen! This is stupid!
And afterwards, he'll probably have to burn his hand and bury it.
I'm not putting my finger up Cartman's butt!
Okay, I fed the pigs. Now I definitely should water some fields... Oh wow, cool. That Jewish kid put up a sign on my farm. "Hey Kyle, really like your farm." Oh awesome!  What the hell is that? Stan? 
They're gonna take The Lord of the Rings from us.
No dude, we can't go around showing our weapons to people. Our parents'll find out we have them.
David Blaine is doing a big performance in Denver tomorrow night.  We're sure his magic will entertain and astound you!
All I wanted was to play one level of Call of Duty and you know what Ike told me? He said the living room was for old people.
Yeah, Cartman, you're swimming around in first-grader pee.
Yeah. We'll be the "Save Films From Their Own Directors" club
I know. It's probably gonna be the biggest night of our lives!
What are you talking about, dude?! I fell down that abyss and there it was!
We're gonna make a short animated Christmas card that everyone can watch and play it on the screen at the old drive-in.
Yeah! What the hell were we thinking?! Boooooo!
God? Please, if you get me out of this, I swear, I will never play with weapons ever again.
I just wanted to see if maybe you want to do fingerpaints with me.
We only have one option. I've gotta take you to the surface.
Come on, Ike! I promise I'll be nice to you from now on!
Okay. But you've gotta promise to not complain.
Dad? Dad! What the hell are you doing?!
All right, then we go with the plan. Just like "To Catch A Predator".  The first guy is here. This is probably HotForBoys219. 
Oh, you're just saying that because he brings you candy.
Ike, you can't possibly want this. We have to tell Mom.
Towelie is cool, but he gets stoned all the time. You can't really rely on him for anything.
That was the dumbest ride I've ever seen!
Aw I don't think he wants to play, dude.
We can't. Kenny just checked. There's a wall of people like seven miles thick behind us.
Oh, man. I can't just sit here, I have to help my stupid brother, or I'll come home without him and my dad will start yelling, "Where's your brother, Kyle?" "You weren't looking out for your little brother, Kyle?"
Dude, will you just end this thing now?! My little brother is gonna die!
Dude, are you sure you wanna do this? Apparently this guy has a black belt in karate.
Because- because that's not even entertainment! I mean, it's just, just, rehashing shit, isn't it?? It's like everything these kids are into these days, you know, it's just... rehashed shit!
It was really important for me to get an A, Stan. And Bebe said you were so reckless with your egg, so I made a fake one for you  and kept the original safe with me.
Because without big corporations we wouldn't have things like cars and computers and canned soup.
Aw, come on. Ned's faking it. That frog was just a piece of plastic!
Yes, Mr. Garrison, I have to go now.
I think out band better buy a whole bunch of music CDs to listen to for inspiration.
Didn't you hear? They outlawed fireworks 'cause a little boy blew off his hands.
"So this is how America works. We have gods and clods. My dad says America needs both rich and poor to survive, but I have a better idea."
Yeah, this guy.  Vladimir Stolfsky. He had videos on YouTube of every single rally.
Look, just go ahead and play, alright?  Leave me alone.  Can I get a Fresca, please?
Yeah, but you know? I think we all learned an important lesson about laughing at other people's misfortunes.
It's okay, Ike, you're going to be... okay.
Oh my God! What the hell are we gonna do for six hours?
Coach! Coach, I'm all better. I'm ready to play.
Mr. Garrison, didn't the guy who shot John Lennon say it was because of this book?
All right, now everybody take a tablet and a pencil.  and when all the ideas start coming, just write 'em down. We might not remember everything otherwise.
We have great news! Our friend has lost forty pounds eating your City Wok food. Here's the before and after photos.
Hey! Hey, let me out of here! This is a mistake! I agreed by accident!
So how was that movie last night, dude?
No you didn't, asshole! What you did was totally stupid and racist! And you only did it to screw me over!
He probably thinks if he apologizes to everyone, we'll think he's changed and let him back into our circle.
Hoh Gohod, I popped it!! Oh hit huhurts!!
The only way you can cancel it out is to get Butters to put your wiener in his mouth.
We don't wanna be in a group with Tweek.
It was like having the life sucked out of you. That' all it is, sliding down a cable. Maybe without a tour group it'd be ...kind of fun. Maybe. But, this was just... a complete disaster.
Well yeah, but not if your decision is for Turd Sandwich! What the hell is wrong with you?!
Cartman, how stupid are you?! Didn't you read the Bible? We have to leave you up there until you die, and then you come back to life in three days.
You've got the best balls in the whole world, Chef.
How many iPod Nanos is friendship worth? I guess, one.
Wait! Stop! Could I have your attention, please?
Hold tight, buddy. We're gonna find a cure for you. 
Yeah, sorry dude uh, I can't make it either.
Look, can you guys just get down to business so we can go find my little brother?
Dude, I can't believe they fell for it!
Then stop saying you're not just sure, you're HIV-positive!  This isn't funny, AIDS isn't funny, dying isn't funny, so shut the fuck up!
How do we find somebody who can wrestle that well?
There it is!  That must be of the antelope family.
Dude, dressing up like Hitler is not badass!
Don't be stupid, Cartman! Butters doesn't have that much blood in him!
Hello?  Excuse me. I'm here to pick up Ike?  Uh, hello? Is Ike here?  Hello? 
Hey. You're right, Wendy. Come on, Stan, we have to go get Cartman. 
Mom. Mom. I found out all about this great new magician named David Blaine.
You don't understand! Willzy-x is from the moon! He'll die if we don't get him back, now! Willzy-x, you have to talk! Come on boy, you have to! I know you're sick, but you could do it!
Yeah. And we're sorry for turning Ned into a vegetable.
Look, this is all getting way too big! Tell the movie studio you aren't selling the video to them.
Aw, I just hit my nose playing dodgeball.
What the hell does that have to do with American history?
Kill it, Stanley. Kill it.  Come on Stan, kill it.
Erm, okay, I know. How about we go to the mall?
He must have a huge bone in his ass, then. 
Hello, ma'am. My name is Kyle. And this is Cartman. We'd like to share our interest in David Blaine with you.
Mom, Dad, you've always taught me that being direct and honest is a basic Jewish tenet.
It's a long trip, dude. You're gonna need help. We can try and get the episode pulled together.
Just take me home! I don't wanna be here anymore! Take me home!
He's right, dude. We have to define our style if we're ever going to make a platinum album. I mean, ah I'm a fusion guy, but Kenny's background is more Latin Jazz.
We've got work to do Stan, I think it takes a while for an elephant to get drunk.
Stan! Stan, what the hell is going on?!
Admit you're lying, and I'll let you go.
Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?! They're identical!
Yeah, our friend has been missing for a few days, so we went and checked on him, and he's in a coma wearing your headset.
Yeah, but now you can be friends with all of us!
This is exactly what you would do if they found lice in your hair! Try to lead the charge against somebody else to take the suspicion off of yourself!
Well, it isn't a guy teacher. It's a woman.
I couldn't get in to see the principal, Ike.
Dude, why aren't people coming to help us?
He is under alien control. That thing in his butt is linked up to the visitors!
Dude, I don't think Kenny's coming back. My dad said those Child Protective Services people are pretty serious.
Wikileaks.  It says here his name is Wikileaks.
He probably just ditched to avoid that spelling test.
Just take a shot or pass the ball, asshole! It's getting late!
There is no such thing as a funny fuse, Cartman. You felt bad.
Yeah... He must be really sick.  Hang on Willzy-x. There's still hope. Stan and Craig might still luck with the space program down in Mexico.
Come on, dude. We've gotta get out of here. I don't know what they're planning next, but it can't be good! 
We... didn't realize what we were doing, eh...
Wait a minute! I've got it! The bullriding contest. Cartman could ride a bull, and try to win $5000.  Think about it, dude: $5000. That's 1000 set of balls. That's 3000 balls! We'd have to win enough to get the dolls!
You bastards! Come back here! Coomme baack!  Damn it, we were so close!
These producers making a big holiday special!  They had me upload a video for a commercial they're about to air! They said my hash tag was awesome, and they wanted to promote it!
There's really people out there without a Facebook friend in the world? That's so wrong.
Why? Why, Mom? Because if I do something bad will happen to me? Because if I do your God might not shower me with his blessings of infected hemorrhoids?
I'm not going in any meat locker so you can trap me!
No- Dude, Gorak is cool because it's original. And besides, you found him.
You know, you used to sit in the living room with your friends and family, and THEY were the ones commenting on whatever was on TV.
Dude, I don't think we should be messing around with that crap anymore.
Well, we'd better get working. Cartman, you go home and call all the pet stores in the phone book.
A break from what?! You haven't done anything!
Hold on. I see.  Oh, Jeezus, this sled is going faaaast.
Please, I need to talk to the people inside. They can't set off that nuke.
Hey! Isn't there where Stark's Pond used to be? Where we used to kayak and fish?
I need to book one trip to the moon, please. Right away.
Dude, the sooner you eat your peas, the sooner you can try to win some of your friends back. Eh ya you need to Bill Clinton this.
I'm not better, I'm just... doing what needs to be done to make the world a better place.
I don't know. But there's gonna be lots of food, and a band.
Go ahead. We don't wanna be in their stupid commercial.
Cool. Thanks, Jimmy, well, I'll check it out.
If someone says they saw a Sasquatch, they are either lying or they are stupid. Now stop lying about a Jewpacabra before stupid people start believing you!
Yeah. You used to sit in the living room with family and friends to hear their commentary on things. Now you can get it with a l-
Do any of you guys have milk money I can borrow?
Wow! I had already forgotten how great third grade was.
He said the Muslims beat them here-  God damn it!
That's what the sixth graders do behind the school at recess. They take way too much cough medicine because they say it makes them see things in their heads.
Listen, aggotfay! An ailnay ilefay so you can eakbray out of isonpray!
That's what you care about?! Who's the poorest kid in school now?!
Look, my fat bastard friend is trying to trick the network into getting Family Guy off the air.
I think we should bail. If we leave the group, maybe other people will get the courage to leave, too.
Dude! Did you really lose all that weight eating nothing but sub sandwiches?
Pulling an episode because someone is offended starts a chain reaction. You'll have to pull more and more episodes until the show goes off the air completely. It's what happened to Laverne & Shirley.
No, I'm being totally serious. That is the best idea you've ever had. You should run away to Mogadishu. You should go there right away. I'll even help pay for your ticket.
We're right here dude. Do you remember now?
Cartman doesn't always win! He just gets pissed off and goes home so we can't debate anymore!
Don't worry. Everything's gonna work out. It always does.
I'm sure that would scare the hell out of him, Cartman.
But we've been playing for eight hours. We can't think of anything else to do.
Go look! It's all an ancient Incan prophecy.
See? We're just watching cartoons, like always. Nothing's changed.
You bastards. Listen, we have to give a huge speech tomorrow about corporate takeovers.
Oh God, here we go again! 9/11 was not a conspiracy, fatass!
Cartman! We've been brainwashed, don't you see? We don't have to do this!
We've got to get rid of them.  Nobody should have the kind of power Barbra Streisand wanted! 
We need help! Our friend is in a coma!
I need $17 so we can win Terrance and Phillip dolls.
I have an idea.  I don't like it, but I think it's the only choice we have.
The whale's name is Willzy-x, and he told us he's dying on our planet. We've come up wth a plan, but we're gonna need all of your help to make it work.
Aagh! For Christ's sake, Cartman, when was the last time you changed your socks?
Because that sounds like we don't have anything, We've been through this already, Stan!
Yeah. I've changed mine three times already 'cause it itches so much.
Wow, I guess this really is a big deal.
It's so awesome, dude. Our company already has a hundred backers. And we still have 14 days to go!
Come on, dude! I can do it! I'm sure!
Go on, Canadian! Beat it! I'm through getting in trouble for you!
Well you made me eat veal and didn't tell me what it was. So go ahead and be angry, you baby calf-killing bitch!
Mom, there might be something that you should look into about Ike staying after school all the time-
Butters, people can't just go around beating up people who have diabetes! Now whatever your problem is, you just-
He got a full dose of the stars.
Did you send the videotape to America's Stupidest Home Videos?
No. I cross-referenced his YouTube profile with MySpace, and according to his blog, he's an old-school Communist. So what's he doing at every Clinton rally?
We're gonna save our parents before they all kill each other!
And this kid is watching Cartman commenting on people commenting on Dragon Age.
Excuse us, we're trying to get a picture of Britney Spears!
Wait. Stan?  Hold on, is this my virtual reality, or Cartman's virtual reality?
This is Cartman. I have to take it.  Hello?
We have to find a way to get the word out! People need to know pushers are being hired to take advantage of people with addiction problems! There has to be a way that we can get to the news company, and sneak in and somehow borrow their TV signal. If we could disguise ourselves as something ridiculous, then-
Cartman, you fucking hunk of fat, rat-fucking hunk of pig-fucking ass fat.
So, you guys are totally broken up then? It's... done?
HAHAHAA! Now I shall rule the --  Aww. Uuugh. God it burns! AAAH! My soul is on fire! Whoa! Oh, I don't like this!  I didn't know it would feel so... dark and evil!
Or if you sold one to an "Eric Cartman"?
That's two against one, 'cause Stan doesn't care. So it's giant douche.
Dude, what the hell? Somebody's gotta stop him.
But our big game with Lakewood is Saturday!
Original zombie? Well, how the hell do we know who the original zombie is?!
E-excuse me, w-we aren't going back now? Aren't we done?
Hello? Will you just give this guy something, please?!
We're not fucking you, they're fucking Stan's grandpa!
Wow, look at all these people playing right now.
Now look! The reason we're in this situation is because people are being stupid! The economy isn't some vengeful being that takes things away from us. The economy is just made up of people, and people have just lost their faith in it.  What people really should be doing is spending more. Spending is fine. People should just go outside. People should just go outside. They should buy the things they need for their friends and family
Here's the thing: Whether or not I'm a part of it, crack baby basketball is popular. Somebody's going to do it. So the only way for me to try and help the situation is to be involved in it, so that I can steer things in a direction that is more beneficial to the actual crack babies.  Oh, it's sooo easy for you, isn't it? I mean, what do you have to do except lay there and think about what you did at school today, or what you want to watch on TV tomorrow? Well sorry, Skippy, but the world isn't always black and white! Just because some people are born poorer than others doesn't mean I can't enjoy a few McDonald's French fries in a hot tub of gravy from Kentucky Fried Chicken!
Yes, ah I'm trying to locate my parents. M-my name is Kyle Broflovski. Yes, I know Obama won.
It is not stupid, Kenny! This is my faith and you shouldn't make fun of it!
Well, then you should. I think that a person has a right to die if they wanna.
Phew. The one videotape is sought after indeed.
Alright, here it goes. Cartman, you aren't really here.
He's not a douche! He talked to my grandma!
Stan, you can't let that Tad guy get to you. Screw him, dude.
No. We just have to show him that there's other girls out there. I say we take him to Raisins.
Oh my God, they killed Kenny! YOU BASTARDS!
I don't want you to jump them, retard!
Yeah, huh! You wanna go with us so that later you go, "Haha, I was working for Wall-Mart all along" or something.
Hey, so... do you wanna be Facebook friends?
Just get the hell out of here, Cartman! You're not serious and you're a detriment to the band!
I guess so. She's, like, his first real girlfriend ever.
Look, I know it isn't exactly what we wanted, but maybe we can train it.
You just feel bad for yourself that you're in detention!
Wow. There must be at least 20 people out there. 
Now we just gotta wait for his urection, and I can give it to my dad.
Cartman, what is going on out there?! What happened to Stan?!
Hoh!  Anyways, you put a spin on it by holding it here and-
I told you Tom Brokaw doesn't have a mustache, fatass!
Dah.  Does that mean you'll go to the dance?
No, fatass, I came to get my brother! We all have to get out of here! It isn't safe.
Gee, you seem a little stressed, Mr. Garrison. Why don't you try some Ritalin? 
And so they put us in these harnesses and helmets. I th-I think that's when we started realizing, "Oh wow, this is actually pretty dangerous."
Man, I can't believe how much people want us to get our winning ticket back.
You don't need that! Get off of it.
You guys can't tell anybody, all right? Not until I figure out what to do.
I said, 'Larry King won't grant me three wishes.'
Sooo, theoretically, if someone was to step in, it would beee, okayyy?
Fine. That's it. I give up. Have fun being miserable.
I happen to be the one person who's putting everyone else's needs before their own!
Dude, I'm not going to lose to Cartman's stupid turd sandwich. 
I used a bunch of bones from the butcher shop.
Why don't they leave those movies alone? We liked them the way they were!
Damn! I thought fourth grade was gonna be different.
How come we never get opportunities like that?
I am taking it personally because Cartman is a retard! Just because he hit his head and went into a coma doesn't mean he's a- Wait, that's it. If I want people to listen to me, I just have to be as stupid as Cartman.
Yeah, It was seriously the most manly thing that's ever happened.
Yeah, there's this guy named Jack Leborkian that goes around and murders people that ask him to, and he doesn't get in any trouble at all.
Rotten, they're both really drunk, but the won't have sex.
Yeah! Then she told us to throw a chair at Ned!
Yeeah, you're welcome. I'm sorry I doubted you. And guys, I'm I'm sorry I acted like a know-it-all. 
Hey, yeah! He and Ned do that stupid TV show.
Okay, hang on guys. I'll use my special power to see into the future and find out where we should head next.
Congratulations, sister. You have heard the noble truth and are now a Blaintologist.
Yeah, maybe that just kind of what they do naturally.
Ah! Ow! Hey, it hurts!  Owie-ow! Help! Ow, that hurts!
It is stupid and immature! So you got people to crap out of their mouths! What do you want, a feakin' medal?!
How the hell did they find out it was us that TP'ed that house?
Stan, I don't think we're supposed to be in the military base. They might shoot us.
Is it illegal for Jewish people to eat Christmas snow?
Oh no, dental floss, what will I do?
Then that's it. I'm... I'm never going to get my brother back. 
Yeah, but that sucks, to get your butt kicked by a girl, Stan.
Butters, Butters, I'm, I'm kind of super busy right now.
Even the dumbest lie can have big consequences.
There's four white birds!  This is what Grandma wants? She wants me to attend Jewleeard.
I don't know. Last night we found him hiding in the kitchen pantry. He was screaming the name "Billy Mays" over and over again.
We have in our possession something of great power.  It is... The Lord of the Rings.
Yeah, what if they had modified the Roman Coliseum every year? It would just be another big douchey stadium now.
'N Sync, Backstreet Boys, New Kids on the Block. All had five members.
Well, we've all talked it through and we've come up with a theory.
No. I found this frozen guy in the woods today.
Damnit! How come every time we get a sweet idea, the government has to screw it up?!
We did it! You see, Cartman? You won us the Terrance and Phillip dolls!
Let's take a test sample: There's four of us, you're a retard, that's one-fourth.
Come on! Let's just get in our sleeping bags and get this night over with.
Come on. I'll tell you all about what happened to me. 
That's exactly what I wanted to hear from you all along. Ah uh I still have to take Butters, but... I hope things can be cool too.
Yeah, well people should  know that peeing in pools is  bad!
I've tried, Wendy. I've called him, I've been to his house. But since his diagnosis, all he's done is gotten worse.
A family! So THAT's why you haven't been able to spread Christmas cheer.
Oh, my ears feel like they're frozen off, and I think I have a hemorrhoid from sitting on the sled for so long.
Kenny was never gonna get his singing right anyway.
Jesus, man, those Earth Day people don't screw around!
Officer Barbrady, I would like to reinstate my previous Shenanigans! This whole carnival is a rip-off!
Oh, I'm swell, Stan. I popped my hemorrhoid trying to climb the fence into Cartmanland, and it got infected. I really need to go to the bathroom, but if I do, it will pop again and the pain will make me pass out. How are you?
This copy of Lord of the Rings made the young Butters behave quite awfully.
This fat fuck thinks he's PewDiePie! Because of him I can't get Ike to come out of his room!
We have to go see Mr. Hankey at the mall, Cartman.
Cartman, you need to stop this stupid little game you're playing!
Aw man, I don't think it's very safe to be on this bus.
We can't get out! The flames are too big!
Dude, I just found out that everybody pees in pools. Why would I go back?
-bring me back my little brother, God damnit!
So we're not TP'ing a house with kids inside it!
Yeah, and then Chef pulled up in his car. 
I am Tooth Decay. Your teeth shall be mine. With candy and treats I will take-
Stan, I have to go home!! I need my cream!! I need my creeheam!!
But we promised the Earth Day people you'd perform.
Kenny, all you did after the cat peed in your face was start running around in circles cheering.
Ssso it was all for nothing. The whole time I was... eating farts for nothing.
Oh for sure, dude! It's the most God-forsaken place on the planet! Things are finally gonna be normal around here.
All the cruel jokes and ridicule will finally be over! Are you happy now, God?! YOU made me look like this!
Hey guys. Guys! Hold up.  Hey uhm, you're kind of friends with that Nichole girl, right?
Well what are we supposed to do with it?
Mister Father!  We have to ask you something.
I didn't "bail," I got picked up by the government!
Okay, so how do we get my little brother back?
What the hell is wrong with you, Cartman? Haven't you noticed the three feet of snow on the ground?
No. This Saturday, for my birthday, my Mom says she's takin' me to Casa Bonita, in Denver, and I get to invite three friends!.
Sir, we are really worried about our friend Clyde. Everywhere he goes people are telling him he had blood on his wiener.
Excuse me, but Ike has homework he's supposed to be doing.
Oh my God, they killed Kenny. You Bastard!!!
No, Muslims can't show an image of Mohammad.
Look out! Here comes the great dragon of Perengraph!
Hey, Stan. Do you know how to play Truth or Dare?
If you didn't eat so much, you wouldn't have diarrhea all the time, fatass!
Oh, just this really really old lady who wishes she was still only 45. 
We've had just about enough, dude! You've been blowing us off for two weeks now! What's up?!
Yeah? Okay, and you checked with Kenny and Token? He's not just staying at their houses?
This isn't paradise and you know it! The people here are starving and dying! The whole world has used Somalia as a dumping ground for toxic waste. Even the fish here are radioactive!  Cartman, just give me my brother  and let us get out of here!
Then why did you send us the goat?
Ike, you need to have a life. Have fun. Then ruin it by having a serious relationship. 
Of course it smells like ass, retard. It's a sewer! 
Cartman, that's the dumbest thing you've ever said - this week!
Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastards!
Hey, Butters!  I got tickets to go see Lion King tonight, and I decided to invite  YOU before anybody else.
Hang in there, Ike. We're gonna get you help.
Well like we said, we didn't know whether or not we should care?
Dude, you don't understand, I'm a Jew. I have a few hang ups about killing Jesus.
Well at least my mom's not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!
That kid and I had a long talk! I told him he was on a slippery slope to becoming a monster like you!
All the time: "Look out for your little brother, Kyle!", "Take care of your little brother, Kyle", and he wasn't even really my little brother.
Wow, level nine already? Dude, you kick ass in "Heaven versus Hell."
Sir, we would love to sign your wife.
Uh, nice costume, dude. Who are you supposed to be? Luke Perry?
Don't know, but it kicks ass.  Wow, dude, you're the luckiest kid in South Park.
All right, but it's gonna take more than one good player to beat the champions, Stan. You'd better have a really good game plan.
Not if you... have some delicious farts for me.
Well we got tickets to see Terrance and Phillip Live in Denver tomorrow night. We paid forty bucks apiece for them.
Guys, stop, stop!  We don't have to do this!
What?!! Sick, dude, I'm not kissing a girl!
Just, you know, make some money off him. Like Honey Boo boo.
No, ah I didn't lie to you. Ah I was um... uh I felt better and then the guys called and said that they felt better and uh-
She's not eating it, it's just coming out her backside!
Hey Cartman! We're almost to level 20! You giving birth in there, or what?
I'm sure we're gonna get word any minute that people have agreed to stop. 
Couple of days?  But Terrance is going to have his human clone by tomorrow.
I'm going to try to save Stan and Butters from getting nuked!
I told him 5:30 and we gotta get going. You in?
Okay. Just be careful you don't end up naked and jacking it in San Diego. 
We need everyone's help here. What you're looking for are big boxes of ballots. Hundreds of them. Please check your basement, your attic, and-
Dude! Dude okay! Stop! I'm sorry!  Says that you are currently... hosting an online chat party for all your friends.
No, I was taking a crap, and I heard you guys talking!
She had a contract with us first! We own her!
You're trying to confuse me now, aren't you?
Yeah, but something is wrong with my brother and it might be your fault!
Uh, can you take my stupid glasses and put them on the night stand. Make sure they're close by, because that fish upset my stomach and I might need them if I have to go to he bathroom later on.
Come on Starvin' Marvin, I want you to meet my little brother.
How hard can it be? Look at it. 
Look, we're sorry, you guys, but the balloon just went up in the air and the dude sang a song and we were suddenly there.
I've designed it to be the best place for them to live. A place where they can finally have the care and happiness they deserve. And if you think it's a bad idea, I really don't care!
Wait. No wait a minute! I've got it. I've totally got it!
Come on, Nurse Token. We're gonna play football, you puss.
Ehheh, Cartman, what the hell are you doing?
Ah- I was just sledding, and the next thing I knew my sled rope got tangled with a bus, uh. I gut dragged for over a hundred miles before the bus finally stopped for gas.  I'm sorry about your sled, Kyle.
Dude, you can't miss Halloween! You have your iPad?
Okay. We won't tell anybody as long as you are super nice to us, every day, from now on.
But it's like eight pages long and they send me a new one like every three weeks! How can they know if I-
But everyone tries that. There has to be something you're exposed to that others aren't. Could we see where you sleep?
Stan, I told you. My mom doesn't want Ike playing hockey. She thinks it's dangerous.
Yeah! So you gotta bust out of here.  So we made you this cake.  There's a ailnay ilefay inside of it.
See, when you start invading people's privacy, eh thinking it's harmless to put up pictures of them they didn't want up - Kenny! - you start a domino effect that eventually screws everything up for everybody!
I dream about it every night. Every time I close my eyes I see us just running away, running while they ray-rape him over and over again.  And because we did nothing... they got away.
All we wanna know is, who has our Okama GameSphere?
Aw, hey dude. What are you doing here?
You are gonna tell everyone that you lied and that we aren't a couple!
I actually hugged you. I held you in my arms and, and, cried with you.
Dude, L. Ron Hubbard was a science-fiction writer. He lived on a boat with only young boys and got busted by the feds numerous times.
Uh-uh-uh what do you mean "they've taken it"? Oh, this isn't happening! This isn't happening!!
No I'm not! God damn it Cartman, you're not gonna kill me off again!
Yeah, I don't know what to do with it, though. Well, see ya.
Dude, I was having this horrible nightmare that we were at this house, and it was filled with Cartmans!
Well, thanks for everything, you guys. You really helped us see how important parents are.
Kenny, how many of my dad's mints are you gonna eat? Jesus!
Kenny's ashes were in an urn, and Cartman drank it, thinking it was chocolate milk mix.
Well what the hell are you doing?! This isn't gonna work now!
Yeah, real life is so boring and stupid.
Here.  We made ten million theoretical dollars. It's all for you. 
What the hell do you think you're doing spreading this crap to kids?!
Yeah. And then we can try the football field. 
Yeah. Come in for a minute, would you?
We can eat it at Cartman's house, and see more naughty pictures of his mom.
All right, look, there's gotta be other Third-World countries with space programs. We've gotta split up and find someplace cheaper, that's all.
But that doesn't mean it has to go off the air. You should like that show. Your sense of humor is just like Family Guy.
Chef, have you ever had something happen to you, but nobody believed you?
Well, I don't know...  and I'll bet Cartman doesn't know either!
Oh this is sweet. I've seen this episode.
Yeah, we're the Goonies, Cartman. Why don't you pretend like you're the fat kid?
Nono wait. I I know how you can reverse it, Cartman.
Mr. Jefferson just seems like he wants to be a kid, not have one.
We're not bailing on the party, we're just think there's... more important things right now!
Look, Cartman, I don't know what's gotten into you, but... I I think it's pretty amazing. And I think it's real. You have to understand why I didn't believe you before.
I endure what I must for the sake of all humanity.
It doesn't matter. He'll be most excited to meet me!
Did you smoke some of your mom's crack?
Cartman was right! The holiday season is for idiots!
Sweet. I made mine go off the jump. 
You know God-damn well what! Now get outta here!
You guys are so good you'll probably go all the way to win the national title!
Dude, did you finish your math homework? I kind of lost track of time last night.
Ex, excuse me?  My name is... Brad. And uh I need to report a crime. Anonymously.
Now, wait a minute! Everyone just stop for one minute!  Look, you guys are gonna end up killing her. Can't you see that Britney isn't in any condition to handle this crap anymore? I know watching celebrities go down can be fun. Me and my friends are just as guilty as all of you, but maybe, we'll just, maybe, ...it's time to let this one go. Just this one time, let's, let's all stop before it's too late, huh?
So, dude, do you have any brothers or sisters?
Bebe, I thought we were going to watch Terrance & Phillip today.
Dude, no wonder terrorists come from places like this! If I grew up here, I'd be pissed off, too!
People aren't gonna support our company if we dig in our heels and say we don't care about anything!
Oh no you don't, Cartman! Every time we get put in a study group, you sit on your ass while the rest of us do all the work!
Dude, because of the electoral college these votes in swing states can really matter.
Jesus, it's freezing out here. He, he could be dead.
There he is! Now, don't let him know we think he's a loser, or else he won't play. 
No, dude, you're supposed to put their hand in warm water and it makes them pee.
You know what you assholes like! You like to fuck! And shit! And fuck! And fuck! And fuck! And fuck!
It's not a game, you derelict! And this isn't Scotch! It's apple juice! 
Can you believe it, Stan? I never thought global warming could happen so fast. I guess... I didn't listen.
We're not basing research for our report on this crap!
Oh dude, check it out. I got a Jake Plummer.
Eminem, Justin Timberlake, Hootie... They all have agents. You need somebody to manage it all for you.
What would we use a marble sack for?
How can we be passé? We're only in 4th grade.
I bet you don't win.
They don't let big fat asses
perform on TV.
Right. But he can't live with the guilt anymore. Because, even if Jesus wasn't really the Son of God, he was still a nice guy. And he didn't deserve what happened to him in Mel Gibson's movie. I I can't sleep at night. I mean, my... friend can't sleep at night.
I don't want to! I don't want anybody telling me how to feel anymore!
You guys don't understand! His wacko teacher is like a schoolgirl! They pass notes to each other in the classroom, they have sex at her house over lunch break,  and during class they sneak out and kiss in the hallways! 
Well, she's not here! That's just great! Thanks a lot, Stan! You're gonna get me busted again!
We don't have time for this! Kenny, keep him away from us! 
Sister, you don't know the half of it.
Boy, that kid's having a hard time adjusting to public school.
Wow uh, you think it takes forty dollars to get people to like me.
Does it look like a pig, or an elephant?
Yyeah well, I-I'm sorry I didn't trust you either.
They just released part 3 in theaters and it made 80 million opening weekend.
We're trying to raise money for our school chef.
Yeah! Like Stan gives a crap if Wendy breaks up!  Stan? 
That isn't my idea! I saw a bus in a garage a couple of blocks back! We need to modify it!
It isn't fair!  I don't want to be an outcast!
I don't know what to do. I just can't seem to get my friend numbers to go up. I'm desperate. That's why I came to you.
If you guys want there to be a Christmas, you'd better come help me!
Here's the control panel that operates all the stars.
NO. I can't, Wendy.  All his negativity is starting to make me depressed. I have to let him go.  And whatever happens next, I'm going to embrace with a totally  positive attitude.
Towelie, over the past few months I have watched you go from an ancillary character with a few amusing catchphrases to a dried out spooge rag covered in the jizz of a thousand older men.
Where are you going?  Ike, where are you going?
Dude, I can't deal with Wall-Mart right now. My parents had me there for three hours last night. 
Aaaarrghhhhhh!  I'm not one of them! Do you understand me?! You'd better get that through your fat head! I will never be one of them, and if you say it again, I swear to God, I'll smash your fucking teeth in! 
The atmosphere is oxygen-based, should support our breathing.
Go ahead! People will just download your songs for free on the Internet anyways!
I didn't see he wouldn't be there, either. Look, all we have to do is get them there, right? Once Terrance and Phillip get together again, it'll be like old times.
I knew Kenny couldn't fit in that tea pot! 
Oh no.  You're not stinking up the entire boat! You're taking a crap off the side into the water!
We'll help you look for him after the game Stan.
Well, not really, except that Kenny keeps eating people's brains.
No, I think it's something you have to try a few times. Until you get it... right. 
Oh! Tha-oh, yeah, the the startup company thing didn't really work out.
I'm going to try and break you away from the computer, Cartman. I need to remove the CPU.
All right McNuggets!  Did we pick the right rooster or what?!
Because Butters isn't a total dick to me!
What the hell is going on?  Hello?  Excuse me, I need to get to Los Angeles.  Hello?! 
A U-Haul. What if we bring Muhammad to South Park in the back of a U-Haul, and he just stays in there out of sight?
In there? But it's very confined. I'll get cramps in my legs.
Well, I just figured you'd vote for my guy! Who's fuckin' friend are you?!  Puffy!
No, I don't have sand in my vagina! I just think it's a little immature for us to be standing around talking about one dumb word being on TV!
They didn't play the Terrance & Phillip trailer again!
Goddammit, Cartman! You only got that because you knew my mom would buy it for me!
Dude, that's not cool. You shouldn't make fun of Christopher Reeve.
She's really taking this grade seriously, Stan. I'm gonna come over so that we can take our egg to school together, all right?
I totally know how we can give the gingers and the celebrities what they want, but keep Muhammad safe. Come on! 
Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo. Haven't you guys ever heard of it?
My company was on Kickstarter too! Why would I get rid of it?!
Oh! Hey Cartman. We're playing dreidel; you wanna try?
We'll just tell your parents we're going on a camping trip with my parents. They'll never know.
Hey Stan, we're gonna go to the movies.
Yeah. I cross-referenced his MySpace page with realtor.com. His parents moved into that green house on Janice Street.
Shut up Terrance, we can geneti-cal engineer anything we want.
I can't wait to get out of school and get our Teiko sports watch.
Cartman, do you even know what's going on? We went to Imaginationland, terrorists attacked it, and now the government is about to-
It's gotta be the Komfort Inn. It's the nicest hotel in South Park. Cartman, go get your camera.
Are you sure this is where they said to be?
I don't know if that's gonna be too easy. 
Come on, everybody. I think Kenny wants to be left alone. 
Cartman, are you still trying to become a lesbian?!
Because you're my little brother, Godddamnit!  And even when I'm fifty and you're forty-five, you're still gonna be my little brother!
But I always read that Native Americans were here, and that Pilgrims and other settlers kind of took their lands from them.
Okay, now put one end of the tube a half an inch into the incision. 
No! You have to show Mohammad, Mr. President!
Hey. We paid for the sea people too. How come they're not making statues of us? 
We want all the country to see that Kenny is alive, and in pain!
Oh cool. We get to watch a movie?
Uh I'm trying, Mr. Mackey, I really am.
Ma'am, please, I think my little brother needs immediate help.
Butters! Hey Butters! You have to check this out!
I can't watch the meteor shower with you, Kenny. I have to go to Jewbilee.
Well Stan, you want to know what I think?
Ike! You are no longer to watch that stupid little YouTube blogging asshole! Do you understand?! You damn kids following these YouTube commentators is bad enough, but i will not have them invading my living room!
Why do they even allow those things in stored?
Yes. Yes, I do, Dad. Now let me tell you how it works in the real world. In the real world, I can either get a Chinpokomon, or I can be the only kid without one, which singles me out, and causes the other kids to make fun of me and kick my ass.
You can't do this! We were gonna build an orphanage! So the crack babies have somewhere to go!
That's because there is no goo, Mr. Cruise. You see, I learned something today. Throughout this whole ordeal, we've all wanted to show things that we weren't allowed to show. But it wasn't because of some magic goo. It was because of the magical power of threatening people with violence. That's obviously the only true power. If there's anything we've all learned, it's that terrorizing people works.
Stan, don't you think this has gone far enough? Is it really that big a deal?  Yeah, just vote. For Giant Douche.
It's not a presentation, it's a hate speech! People aren't creeped out by gingers!
Damn. That guy is the coolest guy in the universe!
Mr. Hankey.  He comes out of the toilet every year and gives presents to everybody who has a lot of fiber in their diet.
No, you're fat to begin with, chubby! Now you're Texan too!
It's too bad Cartman can't be here to enjoy this.
Just because two people are the same race doesn't mean they belong together, you fat racist piece of fucking garbage!
Could I please one of your piping-hot farts in my mouth?
Okay okay... I love having Cartman's farts in my tummy. I love it.  I love it sooo sooo much.
Throw the ball, you stupid frog!  God-damn, maybe if you didn't eat all those croissants,  you'd be able to-- Ow! 
Sorry, dude, but this fruity little club isn't taking our friend!
Cartman, what the hell are you doing?! You're suppsoed to be studying! 
So we were just wondering if we could sue somebody.
Jesus, this sucks! All they keep doin' is dancing around!
He said Madonna is an old anorexic whore who wore out her welcome years ago, and that now she suddenly speaks with a British accent and she thinks she can play guitar and she should go fuck herself. 
Well, we thought you went exploring and like, hunting and stuff!
Dude, I don't think this is very sturdy. 
Yeah, why don't you go eat some more pork rinds or something, you fat fuck?! 
If only we had realized how special our time with his gigantic ass was.
Excuse me, sir? I think I know who did this. We saw this guy at the last crime scene, and, and you know how serial killers sometimes return to the scene of the crime? Well, I followed this guy to his house, and when he left again, I collected some fingerprints and did a blood-sample analysis.  I'm pretty sure he's your man.
Wait, what are you taking Stan's blood for?
I'm sure. Abe Lincoln was right: I don't wanna find out I'm good-looking and become a total shithead when I grow up.
Mister... Jackson, y-you aren't alive. You're in purgatory.
...Oh, and I hope one day to be an investment banker.
I can hide it!  Nobody ever has to know!  I can't ever let anybody know!
You don't get it, Stan! I can play here all I want. I even get free Frescas. I don't need you anymore! 
I don't care if I signed an agreement!
Oh shut up, Cartman! Your Sweet Christmas act isn't fooling anybody!
Cartman, you are hereby declared a full-fledged retard!
The Diamond of Pantheos.  She must be powerless now.
I told you Cartman, I'm not one of them! I don't wanna live in West Jersey any more than you do!
Yeah. He's almost as bad as that guy on Full House.
I'm sorry, Cartman. There's been a little change in plans!
Where is Cartman? He said he was gonna bring money for us to buy a pumpkin.
Okay, it's third down. And now, somebody make a play!
I'll give you five bucks to eat your puke.
We can get people to believe us now!
Rebecca, don't you ever... look at the town? At that...  flicker of light over there?
Okay, so now you'll help us take care of Trent Boyett?
Hey!  How about Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo?
I'm still not inviting you to Casa Bonita.
It's the only way to prove to them that you're real.
Get up, fat boy! I'm gonna kick your ass!
(I need some help! I can't take it!)
Alright Cartman, I've been doin' a lot of thinking about how the company's gonna spend the money we make off the EA Sports deal. We're going to use thirty percent of the money to build an orphanage for the crack babies.
They've just gone crazy for a while. Please, mister, I have to hide my brother until they come to their senses.
I've even unplugged it and plugged it back in.
Dammit Cartman! I gave it to you so you would shut... up.
Goddamnit, don't you get it?! I hate pee! I'm grossed out by pee! The only thing I find more disgusting than pee is bananas!
"David Blaine Workshop. Learn all about David Blaine at the Center for Magic." Dude, we gotta go.
We're sorry, Butters.  Our mind is made up.
But he's just using his time on television to rant about-
You said you could get us money, Cartman!
I've tried talking to him, but he doesn't want the lawsuits to stop. He's making too much money.
You don't wanna go back to stinky Romania, do you? It sucks there.
What the hell are you so happy about, fatass?! 
How is it that Ms. Ellen was suddenly arrested for being an Iraq-
It's too late for that. Things just can't go back, Stan, uh.  Ah-I'm with Cartman Burger now.
I hear your parents might give up selling meth for good.
Wwait, what do you mean? Stan's in danger?
Dude, look, we, we just saw all this stuff on History Channel.
Dude, did your dad know that the show was being broadcast live?
We need him to win a bullriding contest so we can get Terrance and Phillip dolls. Can he still do it?
Oh. Well, come on, we're playing L.A. Noire.
God-damnit dude, your mom and dad want you to come home!
Listen, guys, I appreciate you wanting me around, but, the fact of the matter is, well, yeh, you guys are just kind of douche bags.
Nono Dad, please. I just got Call Of Duty: Advanced Warfare. Me and Ike are going to play it together.
They're saying something about taking over the entire country.
I'm making a dummy Ike doll. My parents think he's out with me right now, and I have to bring him back for dinner.
Yes. It's because the Pharaoh won't give the Hebrews what we want! God is angry.
Ike! Ike! Wake up buddy! Wake up! Ike, you've gotta wake up, please!  Eh there you go. That's good.  Oh Ike. I thought I lost you, little brother.
Hey! Don't try to pass it back on me, fatass!
Will you stop it with that?! What part of this is funny to you?!
I don't know where Cartman is. I think something took him away.
They sneak out during class and make out in the hallways!
Yeah? Well... maybe you can forget what happened, but I... can't.
You've always been a dick to me, Cartman, and I'm not inviting you. 
No no, it's n-it's not like it sounds. Here, check it out.  See look, we just video the babies fighting over a ball full of crack. It's really getting popular!  I mean it, it's cool because like the commercial said, the crack babies had nothing before.  It, it's great, because everyone wins, you know? You see that? Two million hits.  Did you know they're putting bacon inside of pancakes at Denny's?
Stan! Go get the other guys and tell them to meet me at the bus stop in ten minutes!
Tell everyone you made the cow look like that!
Well, YOU don't, because you're a non-caring asshole, Cartman!
Come on, you guys! We better get to work! 
I can't. I have to wait for Rebecca to show up.
No, Ike! Ma, Ike keeps taking off his Squirt uniform!
And you don't see any parallel between that and anything else in history?
Ex-cuse me?! If my little brother has been getting some athlete's hormones, then who has been getting Ike's medication?!
All right, all right, you could be Jesus, you tubby cry-baby!
Nah. Dude, I c-I can't go to have a birthday party while Butters is missing.
Well, I- I invested in that IT thing, and there was a bailout, so I received a five million dollar bailout clause check, which, which I can use to help my family, so, I- I guess, goodbye, cousin. 
Chef, CHEF! You need to get out of here before you get arrested, all right?!
It doesn't matter if I am or not. People voted and I stand behind the president.
I am no longer an XBox guy! I let my friend get grounded, but today I will give him a PlayStation!
No dude, I'm out. Go talk to her yourself. Be poetic. 
Come on, limey, don't be a wuss! Are you just gonna be a little French pig your whole life?
Shut up, fatass! Everyone knows I can spell better than you.
Kick ass, dude! Cartman's mom throws the best birthday parties ever.
Dude, where in the world can Britney Spears go where nobody will bother her?
Don't worry. There's gotta be another cash for gold place around here somewhere.
Is, is this? Do you think this is cool?
Look, maybe he's forgiven us. I mean, we were only in preschool
Oh, like you know what pain is! Go try living in a Third-World country, you little pussy!
Our lives have not been enjoyable, Trent! I promise you! 
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with dreidel I will play
Second verse, same as the first
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidelll-I ma...
Just let us stay up a little longer, mom. Mr. Hankey's gotta show up. He always does.
Alright, alright, let's calm down! I know we're all concerned here!
Dude, did you see that stuff Phil Collins was saying about Timmy?
Yes. His flowing melodies are really enjoyable to us.
You're in a forest! Go take a crap!
Butters has been missing for a week! You might have inadvertently gotten him killed!
I guess you should leave police work to the professionals, huh, Cartman?
Yeah! All you have to do is fart some more, Cartman, and the visitors are sure to come!
All right, fine, Cartman! You really want me to go in there, I'll...  Dude, Cartman, what is that behind you?
He's gone, dude! Butters says he saw him leave.
Yeah, you're a great Meheecan, Butters, just not a great leader of Meheeco. 
Yeah. Check it out.  Ready Ike? Kick the baby!
Aww gee, that's... so sad. Everyone should have one Facebook friend.
That's it, Stan! I'm not sitting through a whole movie with you! 
Yeah. I don't remember him saying anything about this.
You guys, do you really care what a bunch of girls have to say about how you rank in looks?! 
That's okay, we'd rather just go by ourselves.
But if the tape must be brought to the House of Butters, who else can do it?
Oh yeah.  Fine, I'll kick your ass tomorrow, dick! 
Yes. I'm saying one-fourth of Americans are retards.
All Wall-Marts start a self-destruction sequence if you break a mirror in the back.
We thought you were meeting us at Cartman's. What are you doing here, Taylor Swifting?
Don't you guys think this is a little suspicious? We should buy something else so it doesn't look obvious.
Ahh, hi, can we speak to the head guy or something?
We can't deal with you saying "hella" anymore, Cartman! You're going to the other universe! 
Not because of the Jews, Butters! Who told you that?
Yeah, but you know, I learned something today. We thought we could make money on the Internet. But, while the Internet is new and exciting for creative people, it hasn't matured as a distribution mechanism to the extent that one should trade real and immediate opportunities for income for the promise of future online revenue. It will be a few years before digital distribution of media on the Internet can be monetized to the extent that necessitates content producers to forgo their fair value in more traditional media.
Write the number down! Write the number down!!
I believe that you're a broke, ignorant idiot!
Whoa Cartman. Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night.
Hey, why don't we watch some of those porno movie thingies?
Well good for them. They shouldn't! The writers are standing up and saying they aren't going to be intimidated!
Dude, it's been twelve hours. Where the hell are our parents?!
Dude, we have to do whatever we can to get that feeding tube put back in!
How many ways are there to take it?! It's just a stupid word!
Mom! Dad! I have awesome news! The doctor who gave Mr. Garrison his sex change said he can make me tall and black. 
I'll give you ten bucks to eat it.
I'm never gonna win that two tons of candy looking like everybody else!
Did we?! Maybe we could have stopped them!
I am picking up carbon-based life forms in Sector C. I believe we will find a village of peaceful aliens over that ridge. 
Because anybody who thinks 9/11 was a conspiracy is a retard!
Maybe you should go talk to the counselor.
Would you stop scaring everyone with your dumb ass myth!
We made it, Ike. You're going to be okay. 
That fat turd up there is the one who set up you and Token 'cause he thinks blacks belong together! 
Here, give me some money, Cartman!  Lend me money, fat boy!
No, Cartman, I have no idea what you're talking about!
Hey, where's the school bus? We're gonna be late for football practice. 
Well no, not really. It's the Kindergarten teacher, Miss Stevenson.
Because! Everyone is suing everyone else, and you're pretty much the cause of it all!
Because they're an addictive solution to a greater problem, causing disease of both body and mind with consequences far outweighing their supposed benefits.
I only got a jar of gefilte fish.
They're just taking Indiana Jones and they're...  they're raping him! 
I know, I know. Well, look: I'll stay over anyway so I can play for... eighteen hours, and then I'll go to the lake. 
Thank you for seeing us, Mr. Johnson. We were hoping that maybe you have some kind of key that can help us with our disease.
It's okay. Everyone, it's okay. Perhaps one day, you will all understand. What I do, I do because I care about each and every one of you. 
Fine!  Then YOU do it, you're so tough!
Oh dude, we are gonna get it now.
No.  No, I want to have the Antichrist inside me!
Hey, Tweek, you got anymore of this stuff?
I got voted the ugliest boy in the whole class?
Cartman's side is right, for the wrong reasons. But we're wrong, for the right reasons.
Come on, Kenny. You have to get in the circle.
So then why do you just ignore it using something as stupid as Chipotaway?
Yeah, I noticed that too. Let's go get some ice-cold lemonade.
Let me guess: you wrote the joke, and Cartman just laid on the couch eating Twizzlers.
Well Cartman, the South lost! That mean you're our slave for a month!
Whoa whoa wait a minute!  This isn't what I signed up for! I like Family Guy. Why do we have to get it off the air forever?
Yeah. And I think I figured out why.
That's one twenty-fourth of a second of our movie already shot! 
Dude, I didn't know Token lived so far away.
Go on and go home, you fat chicken!
Tango, this is Foxtrot. Are you in position?
Well wait a minute. Don't you see what happened?
No, we'll stay here too. If we start wandering off, we're gonna get lost or killed. Let's just wait here and hope help comes soon.
It happens to be called poutine in Montreal! 
Alright, Cartman! What's so important you had to pull us away from lighting cow crap on fire?!
Heh, don't, don't tell him what it is, dude.
I'm sorry.  I I'm sorry, I can't do this.  I'm not doing this. 
Don't listen to him! You still have a chance to preserve your film! 
Yeah, but now we think maybe heaven isn't a place you can get to, maybe heaven is just an idea. A frame of mind or, or something gay like that. Maybe heaven... is this moment, right now.
How can you say that? Did you see what we did to their house?! It'll take them days to clean that up!
Well, all my life I felt I was black! I've listened to hip-hop, I watch UPN and I love playing basketball! My body doesn't reflect who I am inside.
Uuuh, Chef, you haven't seen Butters around, have you?
Why are you people doing this? Why would you lie like this? To children?
Dude, we're totally lost! We're gonna die out here!
Now she's doomed to walk the earth in limbo. 
Come on, Marvin! We've gotta get your people to Marklar before the missionaries do!
The base where you're from and where our Okama GameSphere is! 
What is going on?! Why do you want Britney Spears to die?!
You know God damned well what's going on! This ends right now! We are a family, and you need to go somewhere else!
Please, Ma. I don't think Kenny has anywhere else to be tonight.
Well, we can still pre-tend like we know what it means.
Goddammit Cartman, will you stop wasting time? I wanna get this over with!
Ike, I didn't tell on you, you got busted by the hallway monitor.  Okay, okay. I did have something to do with it. But someday you're gonna realize it was for the best.
I thought you didn't care about Wendy anymore.
Nonono, we're not going into one of those cheesy places, Cartman!
Wow, there's a lot of profiles here. Kyle Broflovski's amazed Stan has so many Facebook friends. Hey, Kyle Broflovski's amazed Isiah is also a Facebook friend of Stan's.
Stop being a pouty little bitch 'cause you lost, Cartman!
Let me out of here, kid! Why are you doing this?
Copy, Fox trot, let's fly in the goods Tango.
Oh no! No, Ike! You are not watching him comment on things!
Oh c-come on, that can't be why they're all here. There has to be another reason.
Yeah. But there was so much of it. I was up until two in the morning.
All right. Mr. Garrison, have you ever had a friend who got a new girlfriend, and then stopped being your friend, and it pissed you off?
Um, we... sssort of spend all the money on this... one...
The Queen and King of Stan'ses house wish The Lord of the Rings returned to them.
All right, Kenny, let's go!  Kenny?  Kenny!  Don't worry, Kenny. You didn't die for nothing.  We're gonna get Wing back as our client and... and make a ton of money! I swear it to you!
Dude, look who I found prowling around in my back yard.
A-all right, let's split up and look for a passageway. E-everyone take a different direction.  Oh man, we're in big trouble here.
No it wasn't, fatass! I saw you do it!
I was... I was just going to get a drink of water.
Wait a minute. Ha-how the hell did these two guys end up here?
What if this is all just somebody's dream?
This is terrible, dude! Maury Povich parades these poor people around on his show like carnival freaks! And then gives them prizes at the end after they joked about it. What a dick!
What?? "A-ight"'s not cool, either? When did that happen?
It wasn't like Faith Hilling was that great. I mean-
Who took all the pizza and the cake?  What the hell?
Tomorrow's trial, Everyone vs. Everyone, is gonna make things a lot worse! We have to stop it!
So wait. Do we do that spin-around thing on the last beat?
Rainbows are those little arches of color that show up during a rainstorm.
Ike, we could go play the game downstairs. Isn't that better than watching some guy on YouTube playing it?
All right, I really don't want to have to do this, but... I'm not happy with the direction this company is taking.
But, but he's lying! He doesn't have a conscience!
Stop it! Stop!  Oh God! Oh God, help us!
He knew he had to take us all home, too, right?
Ah man! I can't keep my eyes open. 
You dirty son of a bitch, you never told us that we had to win-
Nah, let him make a complete ass out of himself for a little while longer. 
You're wrong. If my dad says something is real, then it's real!
Dude, it just can't be better than ours. It just can't be.
Are you saying that Ike has been given regular doses of hormones because of an IntelliLink screwup?!
Do you know how to start a fire?
You're gonna see it.  WILL SOMEBODY GET ME A GOD DAMNED CHARGER?
Don't be nervous, Cartman. This is gonna be cake.
I guess I didn't realize it was just about the points. 
What does me being a Jew have to do with anything?!
Because, if we go to the tobacco company, I know exactly what'll happen. They'll take us in, and then Rob Reiner will show up with all the townspeople, holding torches or something, and there'll be a big showdown until we talk about what we learned, and change everyone's minds - this is all following a formula!
Dude, what kind of sick joke is that? Girls suck ass.
Yummy yummy I want your farts in my tummy.
Why? Why do I have to accept it when I can change it?
Cartman, what the hell's the matter with you? 
Cartman released the PS4s Cartman. They're being reviewed. People are liking them.
Dude, our town is going to be better without the-  What the?
There's a Hillary Clinton campaign rally.  Cartman? ...Cartman? 
Dude, have you really listened to the sixth track? I think it's my new favorite.
The Earth show can still be good. Just erase everyone's memory so we don't know we're a show.
Can't we just play with that big parachute again or something?
No, we gotta go. Sally Struthers is gonna give us a ride back to Earth.
Cartman, do you remember how we all spent the night at Kenny's a couple of days ago?
I can seriously hold my breath longer than anybody. Somebody time me, all right?
Hey, wait a minute. Towelie always showed up to give us towel advice when we'd said something about water.
Because, dumbass, we can dare them to do gross stuff and make them cry! What? Were you born yesterday?
Suddenly, Stan says he knows about some horse stables. Ih it seemed too good to be true.
But my parents are gonna cut off his ding-dong!
You're not getting away with this, you fat turd! 
Oh no, don't try to pin this on me! You're the one who brought it up!
I'm not being in any  faggy boy band!
But it's gotta be perfect. We're trending well, but we need to attract more followers who want good old family values.
Hold on, this fight could last more than twelve hours. What if we run out of food?
No, I mean what happened at the Pentagon?!
Yeah. No more getting pushed around by fourth graders! 
I knew it! Don't let that fat turd walk all over you, Jimmy! Stand up for yourself!
Aw, dude, come on. I gotta do my science homework.
Yeah.  HEY, WHEN ARE WE GONNA GET TO SOME ACTION, HUH?
How can they make a show out of this? I wasn't even agreeing with them. 
Yeah, it's tough. But it's times like these that... you see what your band is made of. We've gotta fight through the rough times like Journey!
There's no way we can go all the way back. We'll never make it now!
So, do you agree to fight him after school?
How exactly are we gonna use her to scare them?
...But what if I do a bunch of chores around the house? Come on, you're being unfair!
Uch, I didn't think there would actually be a leprechaun! And I still don't! Why would a leprechaun be warning us of a terrorist attack?! There's another explanation for all this.
Carman, will you shut up? I'm trying to find out what's going on.
Alright, this is gonna sting for a second. 
No! No, I'm not going to Peru! Not Peru! 
Let's go. Oh my God, that smells good. 
Wow, you know, Cartman? That is an awesome idea. You should totally go to Somalia.
What do you mean, "there's no tooth fairy?"
How much do you think Mr. Mackey needs?
Ike! Do your impersonation of David Caruso's career!
I hate you, remember?  You wanna be partners, Jimmy?
Wait! Wait a minute.  What about a logic loop?
Oh God! Look, I know you got Asperger's from the school and I I'm sorry. But your negativity is poison to me!
Look man, w-we know what you learned was pretty tough to hear.
Dude, an awards show just for comedy sounds like a bad idea.
Yeah. He doesn't even know that the South loses the Civil War.
I don't know. I feel like I should confront my mom first. But it's so embarrassing.
What?  You mean the missile defense program?!  Butters, where's Cartman supposed to hand over the ballots?!
Really sorry about all this, dude.  So what the heck are we gonna do now? Muhammad isn't safe here.
It sure is. Do you want me to watch it with you, Ike?
Alright guys, listen up! This may sound a little strange, but, the whale, at the Denver Sea Park, is going to die, unless we get it to the moon,
If they give you something small, will you end the strike?
Aw, come on, dude! All you've done for the last four days is mope around! You might as well hang out with those Goth kids who dress in black and talk about pain all the time!
Hey, wait a minute.  Is it possible that...
Ah-ah-ah-are wooden desks all that available? I usually prefer the plastic ones because these give me splinters.
Ogh. Oh cool, she likes basketball? That's perfect! Thanks, you guys!
You know what? At least Scott Malkinson has some self-respect! At least Scott Malkinson doesn't cave into peer pressure and start doing musicals!
How can you be willing to kill people for a holiday special? What's wrong with you?
Well it-... it's okay. there's no denying it all worked out for the best this time a-.
You just hate smoking, so you use all your money and power to force others to think like you. And that's called fascism, you tubby asshole!
Nono, you're right. Somalia is an oasis of treasure and waterfalls. It's totally the pirate's life.
What do you think, Stan. These girls are pretty cute, huh?
Uh, I must have the wrong number. We were trying to reach City Airlines.
I know your family's poor, but you can't just eat an entire bowl of mints for dinner.
I got beat up at school... for being different.
Well just hurry, Butters. You can probably make it back in time before the first commercial break.
Yeah, and, we don't know whether or not we should care.
Fine,  then we'll shut our cable off altogether!
Look, guys, we all have to agree on one system.
Mine neither. But I double-checked, and Cartman was right. Your period is the start of puberty.
Please, you guys. This is for Earth Day.  You care about Mother Earth, don't you?
Damn, you sound pretty sick. Maybe you should go back to the hospital.
Dude, just ask Chef for help. He always knows what to do.
Knock it off! I don't have your stupid picture!
Why do you always have to hit stuff with a stick?!
Cartman, stop! You don't know what you're doing!
Yeah. It's almost as big as Cartman's ass.
Get out of here, Cartman, we're eating dinner!
It was seriously about the greatest night of our lives.
Yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy.
It isn't fair. Cartman's fatter than the goal.
No, Cartman, we're going in there and splicing Fluffy and my elephant together.
It doesn't matter. Because God is going to harden the Pharaoh's heart!
...Okay Cartman, what do you want this time?
Hey, thanks for going through all that to save my life, Stan.
Well, how about we just say, "corporates should be stopped"?
The only thing of yours that's larger in size is your big fat ass!
He said his wish is not to die. 
Yeah, but it's okay Butters. They have purity rings now.
There were no good times! And if he really feels bad he can just tell me himself!
Wow. I think I owe you one, Cartman.
Yeah. Did you make out with him, too?
Off the air? But... we're just going to try to get the Mohammad episode pulled.
Wait. That's it. Atonement. Of course.  I know what I have to do now. Thank you, Father. 
Yeah. I think maybe everything is gonna be okay now.
What the hell are you talking about, Cartman?!
But it's okay, Stan, because I finally figured it out. You see, if someone like Cartman can get a million dollars and his own theme park, then there is no God. There's no God, dude.
Guys, we need to talk to you. I really don't think we wanna be a company that ISIS looks up to. We should maybe issue a statement saying that we don't sanction them.
We went through all that just for some gay video of Earth?
Okay, there. Now we can carry this egg around in this case without it getting cracked.
Cartman, don't you remember the last time you had this dream?
Whoa! What's wrong with your head?! Why are you shaking like that?
How are we supposed to name our startup company if every name is already taken?!
They say they can do whatever they want because imaginary things aren't real!
It was him. It had to have been him!
We think that you might have could it by helping make "shit" an everyday word. 
That wasn't the Mayan apocalypse, you racist idiot!
Then why the hell do they call it "veal"??
It would've been faster if Cartman hadn't slashed the tires!
Just wait till everyone sees my sweet Chewbacca costume. They're gonna be so jealous... 
The knights of Standards and Practices were created to make sure that bad words were kept to a minimum. "Curse words" They're called that because they are a curse. We have to go back to only using curse words in rare, extreme circumstances.
Hey, Pip. Do you wanna be on my team again?
Just admit it, Congo! Admit that you lied about me to Irene!
Yeah, I hate you, but I'm not going to help kill you.
That bull sucks! He's not even bucking or anything!
Aw, stop it, Cartman! Your hand hand doesn't need to breathe!
Dude! We're not digging up my grandma; I'll get in trouble.
Well, it looks like she's not going to show up, Stan. Let's go look for the visitors now.
And then like, out of nowhere, somebody came up with the idea of ziplining.
I hate this town. I-I really really do.
Sir? Sir, can we talk to you for just a second?
Alright, Cartman. I'm gonna give you... a jail-time card.  You lose a turn.
Yeah. How are we supposed to know that pan flute bands would be outlawed?
Look dude, it's just one movie. We wanna have a good time.
How long has it been since you've been back there.
He didn't do anything. He was always with his new girlfriend.
Do you mind telling us what the hell is going on??
We can't give him over to the gingers!
Hi. I've uh...  I've been saving up for a new Xbox game but... but I think you could use the money a lot more than I could. Listen I, I want you to take this.  It's twenty dollars. 
If we're playing outside he shows up completely wasted and, and screaming how the government is following 'im.
Elder, It's not my fault. He told me he was Jewish.
Uh where should I sit? There's no place to sit down here.
We need some more fur.  I think that's good.
There. Did you see? He just flipped you off.
No, Ike! You can't come to school with me. 
Yeah. People are willing to pay big money to see Kenny do this stuff.
They didn't believe me. They thought I was pitching a movie.
Mom, it was nothing. Mohammad just stood there and then drank some tea.
Please you've, you've got to believe me! They've still gotta be here somewhere! Uh we've got to find them!
You did it, Mr. Hankey. You brought back the spirit of Christmas!
You probably should come clean and tell the truth. Did you superglue your bracelet?
I did it! Now I can go to the Raging Pussies!
Look, Stan, you want me to just take care of this egg?
Please, Chef, if I don't get out of school and get my little brother back from the aliens, my parents are gonna disown me.
We don't have time for that, dude! We just have to ditch them! Now!
Yes. My name is Kyle Broflovski. Can you tell me if I purchased an Oculus Rift headset there?
And in the end, I know that somewhere out there... there's the good part of Chef... that's still alive in us all. 
Alright, alright! Knock it off! Stop spreading lies.
Dad, I think Ike is starving to death. 
Mom, Dad!  They're gonna kill her! They're going to in-. Wait, what are you doing here?
This is not a woman! It is a succubus!
That's not what I was trending! They took my hash tag and they raped it! Where is Ike?!
The only reason we scored high was because we took the answers out of Garrison's desk! And you know it!
What, you been living under a rock? This is the new meme, Cat Taylor Swift Reporting.
You're not filling out nicely, you're fatter than ever!
Why would he put anything in your butts?
No, no, w-we we really did write it. Tell them, Butters.
Bu- but I got these tickets to see Lion King on stage.
Hey, uh- we were all just talkin' about how when you get better, we're all gonna go down to Stark's Pond again and go camping. Huh, Stan?
Oh my God. This is like a third-world country.
All right, where are the missing ballots?!  President Obama?
Time for you to get proven wrong, fat boy.
Abraham Lincoln has been dead for two hundred years!
STAN, WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE! 
Uh Butters didn't show. You wanna go to Casa Bonita with us?
What do you mean? We thought she was with you.
You can't do what he wants just because he's the one threatening you with violence!
Come on you guys, we need to figure out how to get out of school so we can get my little brother back.
But right now I'd say if we're gonna have a retard for a friend, I, I have to pick Timmy. Because Timmy doesn't tell any jokes.
Well, it is kinda true, you know? Thanksgiving is fun and all, but the Native Americans got pretty screwed over.
Remember the time when we got an elephant to make love to a pig?
Ike, I'm sorry, but I couldn't get us out of school Friday. I can't take you to Yo Gabba Gabba Live.
I know, but he posted a message of me with a schlong on my head.
We got Cartman's pig so we can splice its genes with my elephant's.
What happened? I thought you were gonna kill yourself.
Hold it!  Principal Victoria, Mr. Mackey, Mrs. Streible. We have something we need to tell you.
No it isn't, you fat turd! Because, I've learned something today. You just hate-  See, I knew it.
Why would they play such a cruel joke on us?
Stan, the PS4 doesn't have the seamless transition between games, movies, and TV offered by XBox One.
That's it.  I'm going to combine my elephant with a pot-bellied pig and make…pot-bellied elephants.  They'd be smart like elephants, but small like pigs.
Wull yeah, but ah-I got my brother back.
Come on, Stan. Hospitals aren't all that bad.
You need to stop recommending that app to people!
Those XBox Ones are as good as ours!
Don't let him touch you! You die if he touches you!
Because you spent all of our money on those stupid rides, fatass! Now, either you're getting on a bull or I'm gonna break your fuckin' head open!
It's so unfair! How can my parents do that to me?!
Come on, dude. All you gotta do is eat it very fast!
Don't you just feel a little bad for Clyde?
It's all right. He can't kill us unless we agree to duel. 
Get back on, fatass! You have to practice!
