That's correct, Chef.

Stan, you can't let that Tad guy get to you. Screw him, dude.

Oh, crap, the sixth graders!

What??

Are you sure you're all right?

We don't even understand how this game is played.

Cartman, can I give you some advice?

Hey Token.  You-you gonna watch the game tonight, Butters? 

I knew you were doing something terrible!

...Oh, yeah. Sorry.

It's too late. The treatment would have killed it all.

Where the hell is he?

Don't make me do this.

Yeah, huh! You wanna go with us so that later you go, "Haha, I was working for Wall-Mart all along" or something.

Well that goes without saying, fatass, how could she help but look at you!

...Jesus?

What are we gonna do with them?

What did Cartman tell you?!

It was like having the life sucked out of you. That' all it is, sliding down a cable. Maybe without a tour group it'd be ...kind of fun. Maybe. But, this was just... a complete disaster.

Okay, fine. You know what? Let's just get it over with!

What?! Aw, dude, don't say that!

Mookie-stinks?

She did, but now they're saying we have to start going back to school anyways. It's totally gay.

Let's just get this over with!

One.  Two. Three! 

Twenty dollars.

I'm still breaking your Xbox. 

That's how God is! And if Pharaoh doesn't give us what we want, next he's gonna kill all Egyptian first born boys!

That people shouldn't sue each other all the time.

So what?

You are such a manipulative asshole, Cartman.

How... do you make semen come out?

Whoa, dude. Your dad is watching Terrance and Phillip.

How??

That's a retarded idea, Cartman!

Thank you for seeing us, Mr. Johnson. We were hoping that maybe you have some kind of key that can help us with our disease.

This is it. 1421 Plaza de Estereotipo.

Oh no! What have we done?!

Yeah, me neither.

We're dead.

They just released part 3 in theaters and it made 80 million opening weekend.

Well, a lot of people like Family Guy too! Who are you to decide it shouldn't be on the air?!

You can't die, Mr. Hankey. You can't.

...Smalls. 

Aw dude, don't do that. That's gay.

Oh boy...

Oh God...

Wow! 

Whoa, dude!

You're not getting away with this, you fat turd! 

Holy shit, dude! Cartman's right! 

He's here!

That's right, we've still got Lorde. You talked to your dad, right Stan?

We need some more fur.  I think that's good.

What? No no no.

He's back! He's back! 

Don't you think you owe everyone an apology for bringing NAMBLA here?

You still have baby teeth, Kenny?

Yeah, give me that flashlight. 

Wait. I thought you called your planet Marklar.

Ah I'm sorry, but I don't really care. I just want to know what medication my little has been getting from you, and why?!

Goddammit tell her! I wanna go home!

Well, we tried, dude. If anyone else in this craphole hates Americans, we'd better just leave the goat and get back to the plane!

Chef!

Awesome!

Kenny will find a way.

Yeah, this guy.  Vladimir Stolfsky. He had videos on YouTube of every single rally.

What other companies?

Tweek.

Butters?  Why?

Yes, I know that! Why do you think I've been putting up with his farts?!

Just read the sentence.

And if the North wins you're our slave for a month??

Aagh! Stop that!

Yes. My name is Kyle Broflovski. Can you tell me if I purchased an Oculus Rift headset there?

Dude! You're still alive, Cartman?

Aah I think you'd rather hear this in private!

There aren't gonna be new shows! Don't you get it?! Terrance and Phillip are Canadian! We have to get Canada to end this strike!

Are you guys having a meeting or something?

There's a lot of holes in the Theory of Evolution too; it doesn't mean it's wrong.

We want all the country to see that Kenny is alive, and in pain!

What?

Hyaaaa! 

Aaahh!

They want you to have sex, God-damnit!!

Oh yeah.

Kenny! What's it doing? 

Stan? 

What the? Where are, where are we?

Ih it sure is quiet up here in the mountains and it's dry, too. Do you have a humidi-humidifier?

Yeah. I hope he makes his Salisbury steak with buttered noodles! 

I'm trying! 

Yeah, we're pissed off.

Dude, my brother's in Milan. There's nothing I can do.

... K.

No! Butters, stop! 

I got beat up at school... for being different.

No, dude, it's the police. 

What?!

Let's go practice. 

Excuse me, is this really what you think she should be doing right now?

Yeah, I like him a lot more than Cartman.

I know.

God damn you!

Aw, dude. 

E-excuse me, w-we aren't going back now? Aren't we done?

I think Stan might've been right. Anyway, I think it's going too far. I mean, if I kill myself, it's gonna make my family really sad.

Why do they have to put this on TV?! 

Chef.

I'll call you back. 

Sorry, dude, but this fruity little club isn't taking our friend!

What? You mean Towelie? 

Hi Superman.

How do you know that?

Dad? Don't you think our last new house is big enough?

You stay away from my little brother!

Frosty, Steve, whatever.

Dude, what are you talkin' about? That was awesome!

Do you really think anything's gonna be any different now?!  Do you really think that this will have the tiniest, smallest effect on the world?  It's still the same old world out there. Look.  What the hell?

Wait. Guys, this, this doesn't seem legal.

Well yeah, but not if your decision is for Turd Sandwich! What the hell is wrong with you?!

Yeah. Do you have any "nurections"?

Jews do NOT carry gold in a little bag around their necks.Cartman! Stop playing around!

Huh wuh, what's the matter?

Yeah. That's not cool, dude. 

Gah, I just don't get it.

It looks even better than their first movie, huh?

Whoa Cartman. Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night.

Hey

Check.

Oh. Uh, can't right now, but maybe another time. See ya! 

God-damnit! 

All right. Butters, go get next to her.

We did it guys. We finally taught Cartman a lesson. I'll bet that now, Cartman is gonna have a long hard think about how he treated gingers.

It's not a presentation, it's a hate speech! People aren't creeped out by gingers!

Hunh?

Come on, Mary!  Push!

Who said I'm inviting you? 

Oh, cool.

Okay. 

We just have to show you this new species because you're the Department of Interior guy now. Soon, they'll all be eaten by bears.

Hoh, Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,

D-ude, I totally miffed that middle part. Did you see that?

Dude, the Civil War reenactment is tomorrow! You're not gonna get it by tomorrow!

All right! We're getting the hell out of here! 

Oh, hi Dad.

Dude, are you okay?

NO.

Okay.

Dear Mr. Castro:  I am an eight-year-old American boy who lives in South Park.

Let's take a test sample: There's four of us, you're a retard, that's one-fourth.

No, they're penguins! Stop it!

I mean, I do, but, well, ever since I became friends with that Kip Drordy kid, a bunch of my other friends have started ignoring me. It would be fine except for my farm is starting to shrink. I know that I should just dump Kip as a friend, but that's such a terrible thing to do and, I'm sorry I'm just so confused I... I really need a friend right now.

Hoh!  Anyways, you put a spin on it by holding it here and-

Here! 

The reason Chef has been saying those terrible things about us is because he's been brainwashed! By this- fruity little club!

Did you guys ever see that one Brady Bunch where the guy... 

Is your mom always like that dude?

He didn't do anything. He was always with his new girlfriend.

He doesn't wanna do it, dude.

You know something? I think that's good. It was wrong to make Timmy a singer.

Maybe their baby will be still-born, like Cartman was. 

Unh, that does it!

It looks like a note.

Dude, where are we going to find a pumpkin to carve?

Come on. I'll tell you all about what happened to me. 

Yes! 

Stan? 

Hello?

Okay, forget it. We'll wait our turn.

You're having nightmares about the ending to World War Z again?

I don't believe it!

What's your mom doing here, dude?

I heard that!

Hey Look! 

What's tree-fitty?

Whattaya think?

Nuh-uh!

Well, I had to see it to believe it!

I was... I was just going to get a drink of water.

You made us pull you to safety because you ate treasure?! You son of a bitch!

Uhh, not cool.

Shoot it Stan.

Probably?! Is Atlantis real??

You can't kill all three of us, Cartman!

You aren't welcome here, Triceratops!

It's okay. You don't have to feel alone anymore. 

(Yes! Please! Let me go!)

Yes, yes! Now the Jews shall take control of Christmas once and for all! HAHA! HAAA!!

...What?!

We... didn't realize what we were doing, eh...

Wha?! Well wait, ahah I wanna see what happens here!

Uh where should I sit? There's no place to sit down here.

Kenny?

What?

We want to talk to who's in charge.

-And I'll labor. 

I can't, Mom. We're working on our school project.

What?

Yeah. You know, I've learned something today. Family isn't about whose blood you have, it's about who you care about.

Wow.  Well that's awesome!

If you guys want there to be a Christmas, you'd better come help me!

I don't want to! It's a stupid name! 

I can't. I have to wait for Rebecca to show up.

But I'll get snow on my gloves and then it will melt and I'll have wet hands.

Oh my God, dude.

No! Please, we have to go!

We have to stop him, dude.

This is fuckin' ridiculous!

Dude, L. Ron Hubbard was a science-fiction writer. He lived on a boat with only young boys and got busted by the feds numerous times.

Now, wait a minute! Everyone just stop for one minute!  Look, you guys are gonna end up killing her. Can't you see that Britney isn't in any condition to handle this crap anymore? I know watching celebrities go down can be fun. Me and my friends are just as guilty as all of you, but maybe, we'll just, maybe, ...it's time to let this one go. Just this one time, let's, let's all stop before it's too late, huh?

Just get out of here!

We believe that films are pieces of art that must be preserved from the perverse hands of their agent filmmakers..

Wugh!

No! Hey!

NO, why the hell would you keep eating something that made you crap blood?!

We know he's dead. We mean, where is his body??

Cartman, stop it!

Hehe. Sissy.

Dude! Let's go look for crocodiles!

What do you mean? We're learning all kinds of cool stuff.

It was such a long time ago!

You are up there! 

Hey, that's it. Oh, my God, that's totally it!  It's so simple!

Uh thanks, Mr. Cosby!

Well, that's not really what you say in the commercial.

This doesn't make any sense!

I don't know. I think... we've been given another chance.

Just do it again, Cartman, and don't make it talk! 

You're gonna give up on Faith Hilling just like that, Butters? How could you?

Arh!

Come here!  You're not actually buying this crap, are you?!

Sweet. How about Steve?

...Dude, you're supposed to vote for Giant Douche.

Hey Cartman.  I care a lot about him, too. 

I've even unplugged it and plugged it back in.

No, ah I don't.

Hey! What are you doing?

But Butters isn't fat.

I don't believe it.

It's not stupid, Stan. For once in my life I feel like I'm part of something.

What's going on?!

Damn, CAA is pretty impressive.

Whattaya say, Cartman?

...What?

"And as the voluminous corporate automaton bulldozes its way through bantam America...

Over here!

Fart, damn you!

That system is totally screwed up and does nothing but wreak havoc!

Well... maybe I'll take just half a hit of acid.

Dude, did you see that stuff Phil Collins was saying about Timmy?

Dude, it's a good show.

Thanks, everybody. I'm sorry I got a little crazy there.

We can get people to believe us now!

You want something new every week, fatass.

You love-

Arrggh! 

Look, guys, we all have to agree on one system.

Oh my God!

Should be the next one. 2778 Mala Vista Drive. Wait, this is City Wok.

Yes! 

That's exactly what I wanted to hear from you all along. Ah uh I still have to take Butters, but... I hope things can be cool too.

Cartman was visited by aliens again last night. And now it's like we're living a repeat of a previous day.

I didn't see a handkerchief. Did you see a handkerchief, Kenny?

Uuuh, Chef, you haven't seen Butters around, have you?

Calm down Butters! The men are taking action. But we need to take your picture.

Well, you're not gonna last down here either, Mr. Hankey. Now, come on! I'm not gonna let you die!

This is our new Ethernopian, Starvin' Marvin. 

Ike, I don't know what to do. All the guys are getting their periods, and I don't think I am. I can't be the last one to get it. I just can't!

Dude, where the hell have you been?!

...And see? Here's one from Butters. It says, "We can't wait to see you back in school, Kenny." And it has a picture of him and you in a little airplane! 

So wait, wait: Stan took a dump in the urinal and he contacted the conspiracy Web site? But the conspiracy site was run by the government?

We knew you could do it!

Dude, that is a sweet RC car!

I'll fight anytime, anywhere!

That's a retarded idea that won't work. Why are you really doing this?

You've never seen anything so ruthless!

Oh, bu- but isn't the cold air making the ball really hard? Ih-it's gonna hurt my hands.

Dude, we weren't playing anybody.

W-what's the matter, Kenny?

Did we?! Maybe we could have stopped them!

Wow, dude! Your grandpa still isn't dead?

Hey, why did you guys forfeit?

You don't remember?!

Uh...

Huh? 

Grandma's watching me. Always watching me.

No Mr. President!! Don't do it!  Help!

What, did he lose a hundred pounds? 

No! ...Not... not like you're saying.

I'm just trying to fit in, Daddy. Don't be such a drama queen! 

You're doing the right thing, Stan. Don't you feel like you're a part of something now?

No, I just can't get it to load.

Ten million?? Well that's more than the Germans want!

His name... is Steve!

Well, what?

Aw, come on!

I like chocolate milk.

Oh cool.

A plebeian?

AAAAAGGGGGHHHHH!!!!! 

You don't know anything about Jews, fatass!

What's he doing?

Sure you do!

Hey, look you guys.

O-Okay.  But don't scare him...

Can you act like you're giving him a lot?

Mr. Jefferson, your son can't get up.

Butters, you know something, don't you?!

Dude, what does that mean?

Ye-yes.

Dude, maybe we don't have to rip a tooth out of Kenny's mouth.

You bastard! 

But I never take off my hat.

Hut, hut. 

We don't wanna be in a group with Tweek.

Good job, dude!

It's okay, Ma.

Yeah. Stan said they're having them over for dinner tonight.

Well, unfortunately for us, he's now on the other side! We are out of options!

HAAHH!!! 

Let him out, Cartman! 

So then, who was responsible for 9/11?

Yeah, we're all set.

Yeah, it's fine.

How?

I'm sailing ay...

Wow! That was easy.

Come on, Cartman! How much do you wanna bet the South doesn't win?!

Yeah. That looks pretty good.

Because we're not referring to gay people! You can be gay and not be a fag.

Dude, have you really listened to the sixth track? I think it's my new favorite.

Awesome!  Oh, crap.

Kenny's ashes were in an urn, and Cartman drank it, thinking it was chocolate milk mix.

My God-damned little brother's trying to follow me to school, again!

What did they do with all the fat? There must have been enough to last an Eskimo family months.

Oh no way! Look!  The pan flute band's put in prison, just like what happened. 

With Cartman singing about his vagina.

Hold on, this fight could last more than twelve hours. What if we run out of food?

God dammit Cartman!

Get him!  Whoa, Tweek! Did you hear that?

He did not say that! You just want him dead so you can have his stupid PSP!

Kenny, we have got to make Stan understand the importance of voting, because he'll definitely vote for our guy.

Dude. I don't know if I'm going to like the new Eric Cartman.

Hey, yeah! He and Ned do that stupid TV show.

That's it.  That's how our parents broke the passcode. I never thought anyone would stoop so low!

There's no way we can go all the way back. We'll never make it now!

Yeah. Stuff just happens.

How?!

No, I mean, this is impossible, Stan! Cartman is the biggest asshole in the world! How is it that God gives him a million dollars?

What, fatass?!

Somebody bet on you, Jesus. You said yourself that one person still had money on you.

To where?

How can you be willing to kill people for a holiday special? What's wrong with you?

There can't be that many pet stores in South Park, dude. 

He was huge.

Yeah yeah, ahh I'll be right there.

I don't know. Do you know where he is, Marvin? 

Me too.

Cartman, don't you remember the last time you had this dream?

Well, Cartman, this is just my opinion, but I think the Line Ride sucked donkey balls!

We just... went on a balloon ride.

HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!

What's the autolocate macro?

You hate Butters.

Hey Ike, how's it going?

-And I'll stand. 

Right. You're Timmy.

Come on come on! Pull!

Where the hell is it??

Nothing happened! There's nothing I can do! 

Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,

I don't know.

Hello?  Excuse me. I'm here to pick up Ike?  Uh, hello? Is Ike here?  Hello? 

Great!

Oh, really?? 

Yeah. It's not a very satisfying feeling.

Hey, where's the school bus? We're gonna be late for football practice. 

You guys, I feel kinda bad for that kid.

Dog parade?

How hard can it be? Look at it. 

Oh. Well, come on, we're playing L.A. Noire.

That's awesome!

Sssoo aside from all the bull crap, what do ya think of the Oculus?

...Alright, that does it!  This has been bothering the hell out of me!  I knew it! You're not Cartman at all!

Goddammit Cartman, will you stop wasting time? I wanna get this over with!

...Dude!

Don't listen to 'em, Cartman! I'm sure it'll work. Go for it. Yaaay, Cartman! Fly, fly, fly!

How can I not be nervous? Trying out for the All-State team has been my dream for years.

Oh no.

You mean to tell me that all this time I've been trying to protect Ike from having his fireman cut off, and he's not even my real brother?!

Okay.

(I need some help! I can't take it!)

Cartman?

Jesus Christ, dude.

No dude, I'm out. Go talk to her yourself. Be poetic. 

Yeah! All you have to do is fart some more, Cartman, and the visitors are sure to come!

Look, Stan, you want me to just take care of this egg?

Wait! I don't wanna know that!

Token.

What?!

Later.

Yeah Stan, we have to go find out if Cartman's pig is pregnant or not.  See ya. 

Cartman? Come on, dude. You have to get up.

Aunt Flo?

That's terrible!

We put a stop to it, until YOU taught them Minecraft.

I'm not from Jersey. I was born here.

All right, this is it! If Wall-Mart has a heart, we have to find it and destroy it! No matter what the Wall-Mart does to try to stop us, we have to be strong! Let's do it.

All right, let's eat Colonel! 

God-dammit! If we miss the commercials, I'll never forgive my brother!

I am no longer an XBox guy! I let my friend get grounded, but today I will give him a PlayStation!

So then, she's gonna be seeing other people? Is she, sort of, available?

Jesus, we made it just in time! 

Uh, oh, this, this is, the new retarded kid.

His name is Steve!

Keep running! 

Kenny!

Well, maybe Mr. Garrison is wrong. You should ask somebody else.

What the hell would you know you fat sweaty Mongoloid, you never get higher than a 'D'!

Damnit!  Tell me what to do, Willzy-x! How do we get you home??

You know what's goin' on. It's Smackdown tonight. Which means we might have to fight each other.

Yeah.

Why the hell would they want that anyway?  Episode I sucked balls.

I don't care! You're not making me wait in the van again!

Yeah. That makes it even worse.

Mr. Hankey?

Go on, Ike.

But I did! Ah, I brought democracy to Cuba!

Oh, man, I don't feel so good.

Do you really think that this is good for Butters? To have his face put up all over signs as the poster child for bullying?

Why? What's it sound like?

Oh, Jesus!

Wugh, game on. 

Run for it! 

You're a dick!

Oh.

That's not fair!

Uh, we need to go to Canada. As soon as possible.

I'm sure that would scare the hell out of him, Cartman.

I'm your big brother, Ike! 

Yeah, he just seems so young.

O-hoho he's dead. Mr. Hankey's dead. 

Yeah, dude.  Nobody does. They're too expensive.

How is it that Ms. Ellen was suddenly arrested for being an Iraq-

Butters told us their play was awesome! 

Yeah! That's Texas, butthole!

What the hell are you doing, fatass?!

Chef should be here any minute.

Did you play the Terrance & Phillip freemium game all day?

It's not cool! Ike isn't old enough to understand.

We're bored.

You wish-

Cartman, what the hell's the matter with you? 

It's stupid!

Yeah, but something is wrong with my brother and it might be your fault!

Well, Cartman?

You're gonna see it.  WILL SOMEBODY GET ME A GOD DAMNED CHARGER?

And you don't see a problem with that?

Why? 

Dude, not now! 

Wookies don't live on Endor!

What?

But it's down in the snow.

Stan's getting worse, you guys.

Are you serious?? Look around: doesn't this bother you at all??  That's YOU one day, fatass! Not even one day! If you don't change something, that's you! In about a year! 

That's what I thought.

Sorry, Mom. I just had to deal with Ike. He-he's been cranky. 

Irene, no! Why?

Ike!  This way!  Iiike! 

Stop talking with your stupid hand!

Sick, dude! 

Huh? 

What do you mean, "can't"?! You made it work; just build us another one!

How the hell did they find out it was us that TP'ed that house?

Oh it's, it's so sad.

But the zombies are coming!

Mom! Dad!

What?

Well, I'm Jewish.

Cartman's side is right, for the wrong reasons. But we're wrong, for the right reasons.

Kick ass, dude!

Damnit! How come every time we get a sweet idea, the government has to screw it up?!

There's no Jews in San Francisco, you retard!

Totally!

Show us.

You got your period too, Kenny?

Uuf.

Boobs are stupid!

It isn't fair. I spent weeks preparing my speech on Latino culture.

You're not filling out nicely, you're fatter than ever!

What the hell is this?

I don't believe it.

I guess so.

Cartman?

Fine!  Then YOU do it, you're so tough!

No way dude. I'm gonna win the costume contest with this sweet Chewbacca costume.

We should use nails, dude.

Sshh!

No they don't!

We have to find Red and Green Mega Man for Cartman's birthday party.

Aw, dude! 

Ahhh!

How do we know which one to use?

Oh shut up, Cartman! Your Sweet Christmas act isn't fooling anybody!

It's working! 

Please, Ma. I don't think Kenny has anywhere else to be tonight.

Come on, Stan! Just strike this kid out so we can end the season! 

Whoa, hang on! We shouldn't be learning how not to get caught. We have to take responsibility for our actions. 

Mr. Hankey!  Mr. Hankey?!  Mr. Hankey?

I'm still not inviting you to Casa Bonita.

Almost. You ready, Timmy?

Just let it go with your fucking balls, you fucking asshole!! Your friends have been in danger and all you care about it this stupid bet! Well I've decided, Cartman, even if we had a bet, that I am never sucking your balls,  you got that?! They can throw me in jail for the rest of my life, but I am  never going to suck your balls,  never! So  there!

We've gotta go tell somebody, quick!

Dude, you need to snap out of this! So Wendy left you for Token. What are you gonna do? Just be miserable your whole life?

So, all boy bands have five members.

All right!  Dad, I can play! 

We have to get past them!

So stop doing it!

When was that?

We need you to protect us... from a bully.

It just... doesn't seem right.

Cartman, what the hell are you doing?

You f-figured this thing all out?

No, I mean what happened at the Pentagon?!

Shut up, fatass!

Tomorrow's trial, Everyone vs. Everyone, is gonna make things a lot worse! We have to stop it!

Eh-heh. L-look, if you want an explanation, you you'd better go to Kenny's house.

You bastards. Listen, we have to give a huge speech tomorrow about corporate takeovers.

Oh wait! We forgot the necklace.

Yeah. 

We're not bailing on the party, we're just think there's... more important things right now!

Really? Uh, Stan, that's great. 

He'll view it as a challenge when he's getting his ass kicked!

Don't worry, you guys. He forgot about Kenny. Kenny will help us.

Then I was right. Job has all his children killed, and Michael Bay gets to keep making movies. There isn't a God.

Ike, jump down, now! For the love of God, Ike, jump!

No. No-it looked dead.

Then stop saying you're not just sure, you're HIV-positive!  This isn't funny, AIDS isn't funny, dying isn't funny, so shut the fuck up!

Yeah, fatass! Get your fat butt on the sled!

Nah, dude. Are you on America's side, Stan? 

Stan? Oh. Well, no, there's nothing here from Stan, but, well, Stan's gonna come and see you real soon, I bet, Kenny.

You measured everyone's wiener except for yours.

Aw I don't think he wants to play, dude.

Okay. Okay, you're right.  Oh uh Cartman: thanks.  Cartman?  What the hell? 

This must be it. "Cleo Broflovski" That's my grandma. 

He is under alien control. That thing in his butt is linked up to the visitors!

What?

I got 'em! Four tickets, 68th row, to Terrance and Phillip! I waited in line since 3 this morning!

Here's the control panel that operates all the stars.

Which one of us took it?! It was so long ago, I c- I can't remember.

All right!

We don't... really know the difference.

Everything turned out okay for those people. And so now you can laugh.

That's enough!

I hear your parents might give up selling meth for good.

Aaaah!

Ike! Ike! Wake up buddy! Wake up! Ike, you've gotta wake up, please!  Eh there you go. That's good.  Oh Ike. I thought I lost you, little brother.

...French fries... pizza... french fries...  come on, Cartman.

It's just me.

Come on, Ike, we can make it just in time for dinner. 

'Cause they're gonna get slaughtered tomorrow, butthole!

Hello? Stan?

Aaaarrghhhhhh!  I'm not one of them! Do you understand me?! You'd better get that through your fat head! I will never be one of them, and if you say it again, I swear to God, I'll smash your fucking teeth in! 

Well what are you gonna do?

All right, it's decided. Let's all write in "Giant Douche."

Goddammit Cartman, stop throwin' those stupid poppy-things at me! 

Ike no! Stop!

A trampoline?

What does that mean?

That doesn't make any sense.

Sure.

Yeah. Do you know him?

I can't watch the meteor shower with you, Kenny. I have to go to Jewbilee.

Huh?

Dude, killing everyone isn't funny!

Oh no! No!!

What if we do a show where we-  Uh, no.

Dude, I didn't know Token lived so far away.

Officer Barbrady, Butters didn't TP that house.

That was a waste of money, Cartman!

Hold on. I see.  Oh, Jeezus, this sled is going faaaast.

He's just... changing a lot. He walks around angry, telling me I'm stupid and, and all he talks about is sex.

Wait! dude, LOOK! 

No! I finally do understand! There is no justice! There is no God! Do you hear me?! I renounce my faith!!

A ladder to heaven.  We build it, climb up, and get our winning ticket back from that asshole Kenny.

We still have an hour before the costume contest, so let's hit the house on the uh-

See ya! 

Butters! Butters, stop it!

You guys are sellouts.

...Yeah. That's gonna suck.

Yeh, we're running out of friends.

Mr. Garrison, will you make him stop!

No, no dude, it went up there.

How big do you think he is?

Rebecca, don't you ever... look at the town? At that...  flicker of light over there?

We did it guys!

Did you smoke some of your mom's crack?

What?!! Sick, dude, I'm not kissing a girl!

My butt hurts.

But that's our music! We like it!

Like look at him. He's always shaking and nervous.

How? How could the Jews do that to Jesus?

...What?

Let me ask you something, Jimmy: What happens on level 2 after you get the Ontario Nugget?!

Seventeen? 

We were almost killed.

It matters, Stan. It it matters.

He catches the feesh so, then he can make money.

No way!

Four weeks we gotta do this?

Our main point is that the flag shouldn't offend anyone, because killing has been around since the beginning of time. All animals kill.  And the animals that don't kill are stupid ones, like cows and turtles and stuff. So people should not be so upset about killing. 

Hey. Hey, look over there, Stan. That Raisins girl is really cute, huh?  Why don't you say hi to her?  Excuse me? 

Dude, if 4 million people play the brown noise at the same time-

Cartman, what the hell is that?

That's just a guy's penis too!

Cool.

Oh God, it's true.

Dude, you've... you've changed.

...You put Kenny's picture on a milk carton??

You see? And then I can take all my homework on my iPad, and swipe it over to my iPhone.

What is it, Mr. Hankey?

Where have you been, dude?

Yeah. 

Yeah.

It's hopeless, dude! Butters must have made it to the hospital. By now our parents probably know we were playing with weapons! We have to get rid of the evidence! 

We have to go see Mr. Hankey at the mall, Cartman.

Ow, my nose! You broke my nose!

He's bleeding pretty bad back here.

Yeah. My school teacher wanted to be a woman, and you made him into one.

No, Ike! You can't come to school with me. 

What the hell are we going to do??

Got 'em!

Why? Aren't you happy here?

Cartman! 

Our lives have not been enjoyable, Trent! I promise you! 

That can't be true! My parents wouldn't do that!

Wow. Cool.

What?! Timmy! You've got to get off that chair!

Well, okay.

Wait. Kenny's going to die?

It's worth a shot. Come on, you guys, we can do this.

Please, sir. I came because I don't think Ike belongs here. Family isn't about whose blood you have in you, family is about the people who cared about you and took care of you. We're not the same blood, but I love my little brother. We've taken care of him because he needed us to, and that makes us more family than anything. 

No more timeouts, fatass!

Then I can give it to my dad. 

Hey, come back! We didn't even get to do our play. 

Yeah, he was too young to be taken from us.

Dude, it can't be cooler than mine.

Yeah! Now, which one of you is the Cartman we can't stand?!

Yeah. How are we supposed to know that pan flute bands would be outlawed?

We aren't talking about gay people.

Aw, screw it; I'm too confused. 

It's hard to be a Jew on Christmas
My friends won't let me join in any games
And I can't sing Christmas songs or decorate a Christmas tree
or leave water out for Rudolph 'cause there's something wrong with me
My people don't believe in Jesus Christ's divinity
I'm a Jew
A lonely Jew
On Christmas
Channukah is nice, but why is it
That Santa passes over my house every year?
And instead of eating ham I have to eat kosher latke
Instead of Silent Night I'm singing huhash dogavish
And what the fuck is up with lighting all these fucking candles, tell me please?
I'm a Jew
A lonely Jew
I'd be merry
But I'm Hebrew
On Christ-maas

What?

Oh my God, they killed Kenny!

You sent us over to Kenny's house on purpose! You wanted us to get sick!

AAAAH! 

Who, Jimmy?! Who pays you?!

Man, this stuff is strong.

What have you done?

No no, it's n-it's not like it sounds. Here, check it out.  See look, we just video the babies fighting over a ball full of crack. It's really getting popular!  I mean it, it's cool because like the commercial said, the crack babies had nothing before.  It, it's great, because everyone wins, you know? You see that? Two million hits.  Did you know they're putting bacon inside of pancakes at Denny's?

A hundred thousand for a picture of Britney peeing on a ladybug. Imagine what a photo of her crapping on a squirrel is worth!

What's your name? 

No, no, uh I wanna be tall and black.

Dude! How are we gonna move twenty three calves to your house?

Does it look like a pig, or an elephant?

Hello?

Ladies and gentlemen, my best friend, Mr. Hankey, is getting sick because South Park has become overcrowded with people who eat health food.

I think we can do it, Stan. I've been close to a million a few times by myself.

I'm sorry. I gotta go home. 

And did you see her lazy eye? You can't even tell what she's looking at.

I'm telling you, it's okay. Maybe you should ask the Lord for guidance.

I wanna be the tough one!

Wuh what'd I do?

We didn't read them!

Well let's look in here. 

What?

Yeah dude. 

Aw, they wanna fight! They just don't know it yet! 

It's not a game, you derelict! And this isn't Scotch! It's apple juice! 

Are you happy now?!

No we don't wanna get high!

What?

And then she walked over to--

Cartman? What the hell?!

Baahir Hakeem.  Born in Chicago, eight years old, his favorite color is green... Car, Cartman, what is this all about?

Look, we're from Colorado! We, we grew up in the United States.

Good point.

Whoa! 

What?! Tell us!

What's going on?

Well sure.

Yeah.

Sick! I felt it on my face!

You just squat, stupid! 

He's my new pet elephant.

Hey!  How about you come to school with me tomorrow, so I can at least prove I'm not crazy to my friends.

We said we wouldn't be a part of this fad and look at you!

Holy shit. Then this is all real. We've all been here from the beginning. Taking turns on the Oculus Rift headset.

What hope?!

No, Ike, go home.

Dude, that's not cool. You shouldn't make fun of Christopher Reeve.

Hey, look. The aliens are getting ice cream.

No, Butters. Look what it's done to you. It's made you even lamer than before.

It's okay. Kenny said he'd get one.

Go, dude, go! 

Are you saying that Ike has been given regular doses of hormones because of an IntelliLink screwup?!

What do you wanna talk about?

The South loses this battle, Cartman. They lose the war!

I went up to Jambu's tank and I tapped three times like the trainer did. Jambu swam up and started talking to me about rocket ships! Come on! You gotta check it out! 

I know! But that doesn't matter any more! These kids don't wanna play the game, they just wanna watch people on YouTube play it.

See? You can still make it for the end of the party.

I have an idea.  I don't like it, but I think it's the only choice we have.

Yeah, me too.

Shut up about Jews, fatass! You don't know anything!

Dude, nobody gives a crap about who your stupid father is! Muhammad is an important issue with actual ethical ramifications!

That son of a bitch!

What'd he say?

You use IntelliLink?? Oh my God! Will you check his records please?

We're all saying the S-word too much! 

Just don't mess with it, Cartman.

Gross!

You were sticking these in your ass, Cartman?!

He's smarter than you, fat boy! I don't even know how you made it into fourth grade! I thought--

Come on, dance!  Daaance!  Dance, damn you!!

I appreciate what you're trying to do, Mick, but I ain't a charity case yet.

God damn it this is serious, you guys! Cartman has stolen the election!

Hello. I'm Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States.

On the sled, fatass!

Dude, this book says there could be infinite alternate realities to every reality.

Wow, level nine already? Dude, you kick ass in "Heaven versus Hell."

Dude, what did you do?

No, you're the minority!

Corn harvest!

NOO!  Noo. No. Awwh.  Aw no...

Totally, dude, let's play Fireman.

We know. 

Butters! Hey Butters!

Gah, ah.  Gaagh.

Yeah, Casa Bonita, this Saturday! 

...No I won't.

I used a bunch of bones from the butcher shop.

Dude, this guy's trying to rook us! We can go someplace else!

Uh oh. I guess we shouldn't have made him eat it. 

You bastards!

But Muhammad can't be seen dad.

You liar, Cartman!

Do you pee in the pool?

Look! There they are!

Well, guys, I guess we're going to Canada.

Cartman??

No. No!! 

But we spent it!

Kenny?

Come on, dude. All you gotta do is eat it very fast!

Yeah! You're dead!

NOOOO!

Thanks.

What if the residue gets on our hands and it leads to harder drugs like those commercials say.

Don't listen to him! You still have a chance to preserve your film! 

Fine! But when you're naked and jackin' it in San Diego, don't ask me for help! 

Stan?

Oh, so you know what mung means, hunh?

I don't think Mr. Jefferson pays enough attention to his son to notice. Come on! 

He got a full dose of the stars.

Alright, here it goes. Cartman, you aren't really here.

Dude, I don't wanna see a bunch of guys' penises!

Because now he's acting like gingers are awesome. And all his friends are gingers. When he wakes up tomorrow and realizes he isn't really ginger, it'll be hysterical!

So, plug it in.

Oh. Then what the hell are we talking to you for? Come on, guys.  Hi, are you Elton John?

...Uh oh.

Cartman, they killed Kenny!

We're gonna level up to detective!

Mr. Mackey, can I talk to you?

'Kay, so now just click on the little soil button...  and then maybe put a sign up to comment on my farm...  Okay, now I can read the sign you put up...

Huh?

He's targeting us.

I can hide it!  Nobody ever has to know!  I can't ever let anybody know!

Stop. It.

Ike, you can't possibly want this. We have to tell Mom.

Abraham Lincoln?

Dude, they're gonna kill Kenny!

Hey, we'd do anything for our bros, man.

Cartman, stay away from that door!

"These, are the morning announcements." 

You knew this whole time? Why?

Disposing of the doll wouldn't be easy. He would have had to have brought a shovel to decapitate it.

Stupid talent agents!

Look, this is all getting way too big! Tell the movie studio you aren't selling the video to them.

All right, fine. Come on, fatass! 

No way, fatty, it's mine!

No! I'm on the away team too! 

Yeah, it was cool, thanks.  Um, so... Is there any way you'd

God, I hope this works.

Really? Thanks, dude! I'm gonna go get a video camera! 

Stop who?

Yeah. You know, like Lauren Hill. A-ight?

Oh, stop it, Cartman! You didn't learn anything! Not a God-damned thing!

What? Y-you gotta vote, dude. Haven't you seen the Rock the Vote stuff or, or Puff Daddy's Vote or Die?!

You guys are so good you'll probably go all the way to win the national title!

Did they say if it's waterproof?

Dude, are you sure you wanna do this? Apparently this guy has a black belt in karate.

Hey, look.  Hello?

Hey, shut your mouth, fatass!

Yeah?

What?!

Yeah, what kind of name is Pip anyway?!

Alright, what is this all about, fatass?!

I don't know if that's gonna be too easy. 

And then we ran out of the Kum & Go and these guys, th-they took our friend.

It doesn't matter if I am or not. People voted and I stand behind the president.

Aw, that's just a rumor. They don't really track y- 

I don't know about this, guys. I think sleds are dangerous.

Cartman! What kind of stupid-ass question is that?! Of course it was fun!

Listen, guys, I appreciate you wanting me around, but, the fact of the matter is, well, yeh, you guys are just kind of douche bags.

Why would Spielberg and Lucas do this?!

Going away? For how long?

Dude, Jambu is the best! 

Wow. That's pretty cool.

All right, look, there's gotta be other Third-World countries with space programs. We've gotta split up and find someplace cheaper, that's all.

Yeah. I don't remember him saying anything about this.

Get out of here, Cartman, we're eating dinner!

Hrrugh! 

All we wanna know is, who has our Okama GameSphere?

We'll help you look for him after the game Stan.

Goddamnit! Goddamnit!

Hey! That's it! That dance! I can ask Rebecca to go to the dance!

Yeah, you're cool. And you don't say "hella."

Okay. We've got $15 between us. That means we get nine balls to throw.

Hey! I'm doing it to save little baby cows. I'm not gonna stop eating meat altogether.

Guys, I think we should bail out of this right now!

Dude, it's a dude! 

God damnit! 

Dude, look, we, we just saw all this stuff on History Channel.

Heunh. 

Dude, this is going awesome.

Look!

Dude, you don't have to be ashamed or anything.

How is that gonna help?!

Yeah... but doesn't it seem like we got out of the White House pretty easily? I mean, it seems like it would be pretty hard to escape from the White House with everyone chasing you, and we just kind of... ran out. 

Look, Stan, we're really getting concerned about this cult that you're getting into.

I'm not going in any meat locker so you can trap me!

What's that?

I didn't steal anything.

...But you can't melt ice with a cool song, 'tardheart.

All right, come on. 

...Wow, that's a little ironic, isn't it?

Woo-whataya mean?

Did you make it to your job interview?

Jesus, what are they doing in there?

No it's not cool!

Nooo!

Oh man! We are in serious trouble!

Dude, you'd better watch it. The principal's right over there. 

This... is exactly what I needed.

Yeah dude! You'll be just like Jared!

Oh, yeah!

Ooww!

Cartman, stop being an asshole! 

What?

Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo
he loves me and I love y-

...Okay Cartman, what do you want this time?

Okay, now put one end of the tube a half an inch into the incision. 

Princess Kenny, I believe it's time we returned the Wizard's hospitality! 

No, I don't! The decision was overturned. 

You bastards!

Not in pee!

There are greater things at work than what you understand.

Go, fatass!

Yeah, none of us wanna marry Butters.

Well at least my mom's not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!

No it's not cool!  My mom won't let me keep him in the house.  She says he's too big, and that his poop is bigger than our couch.

Prove it!

No, it's not cool!

They on'tday?!  Why the ellhay otnay?! It ooktay ourfay ourshay to akebay this Od-damnedgay akecay, and ownay we're otallytay ewedscray!

Okay, okay, wewe'll switch off. Starvin' Marvin can stay here for a week, then at Stan's, then with me.

Chef.

Man, it's really starting to snow.  I hope they don't close the roads.

He is working for the Wall-Mart to stop us from succeeding!

Ike! Go home!

Who is this?

'Cause we hate him.

... I'm hanging up now.

Three months?! But the pay-per-view is tomorrow!

Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,

Hey, where's Cartman?

Dude, what the hell? Somebody's gotta stop him.

Here, Pip, you throw. 

It belongs with its family!

Ah, alright.

No it doesn't. 

Me, too. He sucks.

Kinda like Cartman's dad shipped out on him.

So you know it.

What?? "A-ight"'s not cool, either? When did that happen?

What bastard?

Oh no.  You're not stinking up the entire boat! You're taking a crap off the side into the water!

Duh.

You mean, intercourse with a girl?

Yeah. Why is that good news?

Robbed us of our innocence.

Is that what this is all about?!  You came up with this whole idea so you could get a stupid toy?! 

Not if you... have some delicious farts for me.

No. You know what? Screw this! We aren't ugly!

Don't worry, Mr. Hankey. We'll go tell everyone. Come on, guys. 

What?!

All right. Mr. Garrison, have you ever had a friend who got a new girlfriend, and then stopped being your friend, and it pissed you off?

Profile status?

W-we really didn't see it that way.

You said it!

Mom? Dad? What's a sex-change operation?

Yeah... You know, it seems like something's still not right. 

I need you to keep quiet about this, all right?  My little brother and his tea-

Hut.

Oh, God, what have we done?!

You bastards!

Goodbye, Ike! Be safe! I'll come find you in Nebraska when Mom and Dad are back to normal!

No!

I'm going to break everything that you own! 

We need you, Chef.

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! 

I know.

Steve!

So wait. Do we do that spin-around thing on the last beat?

No.  But I get Channukah presents for eight days.

All right, then we go with the plan. Just like "To Catch A Predator".  The first guy is here. This is probably HotForBoys219. 

No. And I don't want to. Look Stan, maybe we should fo- 

In there! Let's go!  Get this jamb on the door! 

Dude, I just found out that everybody pees in pools. Why would I go back?

But that's all that matter now! It's just all ... and the new celebrity?

Don't push me, asshole!

We didn't think that by pretending you didn't exist, you would really change, but you really have.

Someone is teaching our parents Minecraft. 

Alright, ahhh, why don't we do something else?

How can that be? Already?

I don't have a choice, dude. I'm gonna swallow my pride, face Cartman, and say "Congratulations. You were right" And I'm gonna give him the ten dollars. And hopefully, he won't make a big deal out of it.

Well, let's see how he likes the icy blasts from my nunchucks of Sokuromoto! 

Holy crap, dude! 

Nothing. Um , my period is really uuuh...  Uuuh, my period is going swimmingly.

Oh, stop it, Cartman! 

You guys are wasting your time.

Aaaaah! 

But there's only four of you.

You're gonna need to kick more ass than that to beat the Cowboys.

Stan, don't say that.

You son of a bitch! I won't let you win! You hear me?!

This is not Mr. Hankey!  This is a fake! 

We're all here today because Chef has been such an important part of our lives. A lot of us don't agree with the choices Chef has made in the past few days.  Some of us... feel hurt... and confused that he seemed to turn his back on us.  But we can't let the events of the last week take away the memories of how much Chef made us smile.  I'm gonna remember Chef as the jolly old guy who always broke into song.  I'm gonna remember Chef... as the guy who gave us advice to live by.  So you see, we shouldn't be mad at Chef for leaving us. We should be mad at that little fruity club for scrambling his brains.

You haven't done anything yet!

Huh? Why not?

We don't WANNA go!

All right dude, what the hell has gotten into you?! I don't trust for one second that your sudden concern for the Muslim people is real!

Stan?

Whoa, dude, this is our new classroom?

How much do you wanna bet?!

Yeah, and if you couldn't prove there was a leprechaun, you have to give me ten dollars! Now just pay up and stop being stupid!

Yes.

Hey Stan, isn't that your dog?

What??

Behold! Here's your false prophet!

What are you doing here?

Why not?

Let me out of here, kid! Why are you doing this?

I can't. Just leave me behind.

Go ahead! People will just download your songs for free on the Internet anyways!

"David Blaine Workshop. Learn all about David Blaine at the Center for Magic." Dude, we gotta go.

What's "pubes"?

What?

What?!

Deformed how?

Don't worry, Ike. Squirts is fun. And I'll be right over there in the next building. 

You... bastard? 

Dude, we have to do whatever we can to get that feeding tube put back in!

Oh no. Cartman, no!

Well, she's not here! That's just great! Thanks a lot, Stan! You're gonna get me busted again!

Jesus Christ.

We're bastards!

Yeah, why don't you go eat some more pork rinds or something, you fat fuck?! 

...Cartman?

Wha- whataya mean?

Heck yeah I'll visit your farm! You should check mine out too!

You're not the real Mr. Hankey.

Ike, I just want us to be friends again.

Don't worry, Ike! The strike will be over soon! 

We don't have time for that, dude! We just have to ditch them! Now!

No. We can't, dude. We have to win the Terrance and Phillip dolls.

Oh is, is this beef?

Crack baby... basketball.

We beat Close-up Animals!

Right, you're not fat.

Why do I have HIV?!

You hate Wall-Mart, too? 

Dude. You have sex with children.

Jesus Christ, you can't even walk down an aisle to get your candy? 

Dude, he talks! The orca whale talks!

The liposuction is a process of siphoning out the excess fat. 

Hoh! Uh, Rebecca. There's this dance, see, at the school, and um,

Oh!  Phew.

Oh n-no, I'm not really friends with him.

You're lying!

I'm scared!

Ike!

Hey. Uh, this is Stan.

Who is Saint Peter?

Hohly crahap, duhude, heh!

No. This is taking forever.

Dude, I don't wanna watch this thing have a baby.

Hey, look, it's Mr. Garrison.

Oh my God! What the hell are we gonna do for six hours?

Cartman, you are poor and you are stupid!

Yeah, they're almost as big as his mom's. 

You guys, we have to hurry!

Seriously, Cartman. You could make money with these!

I saved up enough to buy M-80s this year.

But I always read that Native Americans were here, and that Pilgrims and other settlers kind of took their lands from them.

Butters, you have to tell us what Cartman is up to!

Whoa! 

He still thinks he's a Vietnamese prostitute.

Yes we do! Just not the Christian heaven!

God, will you shut up?!

This has gone far enough!  How can we make people see the difference between being sensitive to obesity and letting fat people walk all over us?!

What's the number to dial out?

You suck, Cartman!

Alright! Get ready, Timmy.

What are you people talking about?

This is a really good turnout.

Ah. Oh, now I already told them.

Trent Boyett is being released from Juvenile Hall.

Hey! You can't do that! 

Look! It might be a coincidence, but I think we'd better ask someone. Come on! 

God damnit!

He's my creature!

Wait!  I brought him! I brought him to show you! 

Dude! I'm glad to see you. You would not believe the night I had.

Like what?

No?

We don't? But what if we're wrong?

I'm so glad we're not murderers. 

Oh no, don't try to pin this on me! You're the one who brought it up!

Look at yourself! You've got to lay off the cheese! 

Oh my God.

You are NOT KILLING FAMILY GUY!!

Cartman!!! 

Where do we go? 

Jesus Christ! They can bat themselves out!  Our whole summer, dude. We have to play this boring game all summer long.

Our band can't find a stylistic direction to go in. We need to go down to the mall to buy hundreds of CDs to listen to so we can define our sound.

...Yeah. Or we could just show our asses.

Oh God, it was horrible!

Yeah. I think Phil Collins rocks the house.

Because! 

And Cartman for having a whore for a mom.

Hey, look!  See Mr. Hankey at the Mall of Nebraska... Wow! We have to go, dude!

Gee, you seem a little stressed, Mr. Garrison. Why don't you try some Ritalin? 

Wait. I don't know if this is cool.

You want Tammy to give you a B.J.?

Hey yeah, what about poor McNuggets? What's he gonna do now?

Ah, Ah I, ah I thought...

Yeah.

Nooooo! 

Du-hude! Your dad's a retard! 

AAAAAAAA!

No, that... I thought that was a lot.

Hang on, Willzy-x. We'll in Mexico soon!.

But how are we gonna get to the North Pole?

You "beat off?"

Stan should be Jesus.

Then don't belittle my people you fuckin' fatass!

I-It's good that it became something else.

Oh, okay.

Oh, Jesus, this bus is going fast!  Oh, I did it again!!

Wait, we're sex addicts? Uh-are you sure?

N-no way! Do it yourself.

I can sing the Mr. Hankey song...

Yeah, but you know, I learned something today. We thought we could make money on the Internet. But, while the Internet is new and exciting for creative people, it hasn't matured as a distribution mechanism to the extent that one should trade real and immediate opportunities for income for the promise of future online revenue. It will be a few years before digital distribution of media on the Internet can be monetized to the extent that necessitates content producers to forgo their fair value in more traditional media.

Yeah, it was like four days ago!

Dad? Dad! What the hell are you doing?!

You know, I think we all learned something today. It's fine to have your own beliefs and your own traditions, but as soon as you start excluding people from your ways, only because of their race, you become separatists. And being a separatist sucks ass.

You're not gonna believe this.

Stan, you can't leave!

Where did you hear that?

Cartman, uh, all I was trying to tell you at Wall-Mart was that you-

I'm sorry.

My potential hasn't even been reached.

Well, then you gotta ride it out, Butters.

Yeah, I've gotta get back to Connecticut.

A giant douche.

Look dude, it's just one movie. We wanna have a good time.

What terrifying secret?

No, I think it's something you have to try a few times. Until you get it... right. 

My name is Kyle Broflovski. My friend was raped last Memorial Day weekend. And, and I  I'm gonna help prosecute the men responsible.

Ike, there's been a mistake. You don't understand.

It's more than you've got!

Phil Collins Hill on Saturday! You got it!

Why the hell was this book banned?!

What are you doing here? 

I think if we try Kenny's neighborhood, we might find a- 

Hey dude, ah are you the guys messing with Cartman's stuffed animals?

We totally think you should have more money.

Did you see it?

Why is that bad?

It's true.  He doesn't care what faith you are.
Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo
he loves me and I love you
Therefore, vicariously he loves you
Even if-

Huh?  Dude, what the fuck?

Yeah, yeah, that's cool. Bring the left titty out some more.  Yeah, yeah freeze there. 

Wait! 

You know God damned well what's going on! This ends right now! We are a family, and you need to go somewhere else!

We heard that you might be teaching Minecraft to adults.

This is ridiculous! Are we really going to go out there and play North Park like this?!

Kenny, who told you about this game?

We've gotta hurry, it's getting late! 

Uuuh, okay.  Gah!

Erm, okay, I know. How about we go to the mall?

It just seems so unfair. People won't ever even know that the wrong man is in the White House.

I've got something to show Steve, dick!

Goddamnit, don't you get it?! I hate pee! I'm grossed out by pee! The only thing I find more disgusting than pee is bananas!

Mr. Hankey!  Where the hell did you go?

Fuck you!

Cartman? Go, Cartman.

Yes!

We've gotta find the television department. 

How dare she talk to us like that?!

The fight is over, Cartman!

It would've been faster if Cartman hadn't slashed the tires!

Agggh! Agggh!  No! 

Ih it's not working.

Wow! I guess reading really does suck ass!

No! These don't belong to you! They belong to the people!

They knew that staying at Kenny's house would get us sick, and they made us do it anyway.

Behold! Mr. Hankey! 

Guys, I'm really worried about my brother.

No, I'm serious. What is that behind you?

This is it, Stan. If you strike this kid out, we all get to go home.

Ass-raper.

I told him 5:30 and we gotta get going. You in?

Can't we just play with that big parachute again or something?

That's nice, Cartman.

That's not being nice! That's just putting on a nice sweater!

You're not copying my homework, you lazy turd.

I knew Kenny couldn't fit in that tea pot! 

Nope! We're gonna have all the pizza you can eat, twenty different cakes, and Lorde is going to play live!

This is exactly what you would do if they found lice in your hair! Try to lead the charge against somebody else to take the suspicion off of yourself!

Mom, Dad, you've always taught me that being direct and honest is a basic Jewish tenet.

Dude!

Gah! Just leave me alone! 

Hey yeah! That'd be sweet! We could totally ruin their lives! 

I don't know.

Dad! Dad, I need a lawyer!

Dude, we're gonna go sneak into Cartman's and change him back into a non-ginger!

What the hell is wrong with everybody?

You mean you can see him?  Ah-I'm not crazy? 

I'm a Vulcan!

It was?

Huh?

I'm not being in any  faggy boy band!

Man. Cartman's more screwed up than I thought.

Will you shut up already?! 

I guess I didn't realize it was just about the points. 

I will!

Come on, we have to finish the quest in Stonehaven. 

You sure you don't wanna back out?

What are you doing?

Oh no, dude!

What are you doing?

Shh. Shut up, Kenny. 

I see... a man... with a baseball cap.  He's killing now... Oh! I'm seeing it all flash before my eyes! The guy's name is Michael Deets, and he lives at 621 Castillo Street. He's usually there between seven and eleven p.m.

No, Muslims can't show an image of Mohammad.

Okay, hang on guys. I'll use my special power to see into the future and find out where we should head next.

So I'm thinking we do the part about Jimmy's relationship with his alcoholic father after you smash Butters onto the table.

Two-year-olds are too old for Mr. Hat.

Out! 

Those things are stupid, Cartman. They just stick your hand in cold spaghetti and tell you it's intestines and stuff.

So you crapped out of your mouth! Good for you! It's still stupid and immature! 

Mom! Dad! We rode on Santa's sleigh!

Cast on him again.

What's the big deal? Don't you understand what ignorant prejudice like that can lead to? I have to disprove Cartman's hateful rumors! Do you know any red-haired, freckled kids?

Well, c-cause dude, I'm Jewish, a-and you know...

Yeah, but it's okay Butters. They have purity rings now.

They're Olympic games for handicapped people.

Well? Now what are we going to do?

Starvin' Marvin!

Hey, Timmy's back!

You're doing what?

The acid. Dude, I'm totally tripping balls.

He's not a douche! He talked to my grandma!

Oh Jesus, I should have known!

Oh my God! Our GameSphere! You've gotta move me closer! 

God damn it, that wasn't my idea!

Yeah, make up your mind, dude!

Wait wait it-it's Stan's birthday.

Hey, Tweek, you got anymore of this stuff?

Whoa, dude.

Why the hell would you want three copies of the same movie?

What? Oh my God.

Yeah! I could just say I got my period! It's not like they'll check. I can just say I got my period, 'cause I really will get it someday! It's not really lying, it's just jumping the gun a little.

No they don't!

But he's just using his time on television to rant about-

Attack! 

You too! Right now! #webelieveinyou! We've got to make him appear! 

That wasn't quite ten seconds.

I didn't know you were depressed.

What?

What?!

N-no, I'm just saying that I think-

Dude! Timmy's chair is packed with all that stuff! We've gotta help him!

Thank you, rabbi.  In 1973, the United States officially issued an apology to the African American community for slavery. In 1956, Germany officially apologized for World War II AND the Holocaust. And now, I believe, in 2004, the Jewish community needs to apologize for the death of Jesus.

Off the air? But... we're just going to try to get the Mohammad episode pulled.

Yeah dude. You were totally wrong.

Chef Aid?

Does anybody even go to Blockbuster anymore?

What the hell are you talking about, Cartman?!

Dude, that poor kid. 

So we were just wondering if we could sue somebody.

Sup, Jason? 

That'd disgusting, dude!

You mean everyone has been wanting Britney Spears to kill herself?

Word!

What?

Step on it, Bill Cosby! 

Here's a shoebox! 

Alright.

Stop it, Cartman!

Vi, Visitors, this morning you took my little brother, Ike. He's the little freckled kid that looks like a football. At first, I was happy you took him away. But I've learned something today. That having a little brother... is a pretty special thing.

Aha, and I'll have the City Chicken.

Goddammit, Chef isn't like that! Something funny is going on around here!

We can't. We're saving our money for the balls in Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth game.

She had a contract with us first! We own her!

Well, I- I invested in that IT thing, and there was a bailout, so I received a five million dollar bailout clause check, which, which I can use to help my family, so, I- I guess, goodbye, cousin. 

You're watching someone play Call Of Duty and talk about it?

All right! We're going to Canada!

Wow, look at all these people playing right now.

Thirteen point seven inches?

When Towelie is doing heroin, he doesn't care about anything.

Tijuana, Mexico!

There. Did you see? He just flipped you off.

Yeah dude!

Hey, that went really well. They really liked it.

No, my little brother's been abducted by aliens.  It's true! Ask Cartman, they gave him an anal probe.

No! We're already halfway done.

Wow, it's been like two days.

K... what if we cover his face with a paper bag?

Dude! I've been freaked out this whole time because of that guy's movie?

Me neither.

Look, I doubt we could break a million together anyway.

Right. Except for it really isn't.

I wanna be the tough one.

Can't... glue... any... more. 

What?! What did you say?!

Yeah, dude!

We don't know what you're talking about, lardbutt.

We know, Cartman!

You'll see! 

Oh no, I'm not sane yet!

Well, I just figured you'd vote for my guy! Who's fuckin' friend are you?!  Puffy!

We made it, Ike. You're going to be okay. 

You might as well just say Pilgrims and Indians were all aliens who came here and made some kind of intergalactic treaty!

Yeah, It was seriously the most manly thing that's ever happened.

No.

Errh!

The author meant to be as gross as possible because it was funny!

He recognizes you dude.

No, don't you see? Cartman never had psychic visions. And neither do these people. The plain simple truth is that nobody is psychic. There's a logical explanation for every psychic story you've ever heard.

Wait...

Yeah, but it was totally worth it. 

What the hell are you doing, fatass?

Listen, doucher! Our parents are gonna kill us, and you, if they found out that we bought these!

Hoh, geez. 

Oh, no, dude!

We didn't realize hunger made you feel so bad.

Cool! Thanks, Chef!

Wow...

Yeah, this life is short. The afterlife is forever.

Really?

Dude!

Yeah!

I'm just doing the line.

No, ah I didn't lie to you. Ah I was um... uh I felt better and then the guys called and said that they felt better and uh-

Jesus, you may be right.

Dude, everyone's leaving! We can walk right up to the tank and really study him.

Let's just... let's just walk this way. 

Do we have everything?

Finally.  It's over.

What?! But she looks just like everybody else. Up yours, Tina Yothers! 

Oh no.

Oh cool. We get to watch a movie?

Hold on everybody. This thing isn't even a-

It was really about the most man thing I think we've ever been a part of.

Dude, shop class sucks. Maybe we should have taken home ec.

Who's everyone?! Who all is in on this?!

Wait, wai- I can't let this happen.  Butters.

Ike!

Yeah, it's tough. But it's times like these that... you see what your band is made of. We've gotta fight through the rough times like Journey!

Well I wish I didn't have any parents! 

Please, you guys. This is for Earth Day.  You care about Mother Earth, don't you?

It's unbelievable, Stan. EA Sports just used us the entire time. We worked for nothing and EA made all the money. You know, I don't think we actually deserved getting screwed over but, but I guess making tons of money off of people who are making nothing is always gonna cause problems. I know, I know, right? We might've got screwed, but the really tragic thing is that those, those poor crack babies at the hospitals are just gonna be stuck there, with nowhere to go.  No way!  This is it!

Yeah, the Fat Ass Olympics.

Just take me home! I don't wanna be here anymore! Take me home!

All you need to know is I'm way awesomer than you think, okay?!

We'll see!

Leave him alone, butthole!

You only need one copy, r-tard!

Just stop it!  Stoop iiit!!  There's a logical explanation for that.

Yeah, he sure is.

Ike, we could go play the game downstairs. Isn't that better than watching some guy on YouTube playing it?

Come on, Ike, hurry up!  Where is the next train going?

Oh. Good idea, Phillip. Let's look for treasuh.

Hey dude.

Huh?

I'm sorry Token, I had to tell him. His life is in danger.

Is that an umbrella you're using?

What are you doing?

But that's stupid.  How can that replace Faith Hilling? It doesn't even make any sense.

Try it.  We'll see you in a while, we got to go get Cartman's pig.

I just don't know what to do. I mean, I hate Cartman with all my heart, but I can't stop feeling ashamed for taking advantage of him. But should I feel ashamed? Oh, whatever lowered the bar is not my fault. So if I kind of go with it, is it really unfair to Cartman?

Hey, hey, look at this. 

Oh no. Nohoho no. Cartman, don;t you do this! The Middle East is finally at peace!

Hey, dudes.

My life can't get any worse!

Why aren't the cops coming in?

Rats.

Yeah, I guess.

Well, maybe we can sneak in over there. Come on.  Sshh. 

About what?

I've had enough of the Bible. What has it gotten me?

WHAT?!

Bebe, I thought we were going to watch Terrance & Phillip today.

I'm not sure.

Oh who pees in the shower?

Jimmy, did you finish your book report?

Then don't eat 14 Egg waffles for lunch, fatass!

Mr. Jackson, please, you're causing a lot of problems.

You guys, we've just been screwed over and lied to!

That's more than ten bucks, you stupid fatass!

Oh, no!

What's that?

It's crazy, dude! They're saying it's because I agreed to the latest terms and conditions on iTunes!

I don't care.

You're a murderer.

God-damnit Cartman!

Dude, you don't want your first kiss to be something you paid for. It's supposed to be special.

I don't have it!

This is just startin' to look like another one of those times where it-it's gonna end up with the whole town turning out, it's a big showdown happening, and us havin' to talk about what we learned, and I say we just stop right now, and go play cards or something.

AAAAAAAAAAAA- 

Come on guys! We gotta go tell Chef he's in love with a succubus.

How do you know?!

I think it went really good. Those people really got into it.

Are you fucking kidding me?! 

Kenny! You're alive!

Heheheh, buns.

It says, "Read Teetle the Timid Ta-- Taa-- The Taxi--" What's this word?

Yeah.

Oh, no! No!

Yeah! 

Dude! Every time we play Americans vs. Bosnians, you cheat!

Ike is starting his first day of kindergarten.

Cartman, you need to stop this stupid little game you're playing!

Mr. Hat, may I please be excused from class?

Wow!

We've gotta do something, Chef. If we don't we don't stop that network,  "shit" will become an even more acceptable word!

Chef, CHEF! You need to get out of here before you get arrested, all right?!

Earth?

You won the bet. You were totally accurate about being able to crap out your mouth, and I've just been frustrated because I didn't think of it first. I want you to enjoy that money because... you really impressed me with your insight and... I'm... proud to have you as a friend.

I'm just not sure this is the name people are gonna give money to.

No, it's Cartman. Something's really wrong with him. 

Oh. Ah, we're trying to reach Oculus Customer Service.

...What the hell just happened?

Cartman, there's something I need to tell you.

Dude! We're surrounded by perverts.

What the hell is that?

Oh my God, this book says that negative and positive are the same thing; that real and not real are one.

Wait... stop it, stop it!  I can't let Kenny be sock-dried.

Yes!!

I'm here to bust out Steve.

Those XBox Ones are as good as ours!

Look, we're just trying to show you there's other girls out there.

You are?

Ahem, wha? What's going on, Stan?

Woohoo! Yeah!

Craig, if Cartman didn't do anything, then he doesn't deserve any of the credit!

NO. I can't, Wendy.  All his negativity is starting to make me depressed. I have to let him go.  And whatever happens next, I'm going to embrace with a totally  positive attitude.

He was very brave. He risked his life so that Mephesto could live.

They did?

Okay, dude, it's 3:30. 

Yeah, I hope they protest TV shows forever.

Boy, that kid's having a hard time adjusting to public school.

We think that you might have could it by helping make "shit" an everyday word. 

You guys don't understand! His wacko teacher is like a schoolgirl! They pass notes to each other in the classroom, they have sex at her house over lunch break,  and during class they sneak out and kiss in the hallways! 

Hear that? It sounds like water.

Just go behind a tree.

AIDS?! 

Dude, that's all pee!

Eh-xcuse me, there's been a misunderstanding.

You can't be standing there, Cartman.

Hey!

But won't your grampa be there?

Dude, that's so wrong!

Stan!

What do you mean?

No. This Saturday, for my birthday, my Mom says she's takin' me to Casa Bonita, in Denver, and I get to invite three friends!.

Oh my God!

Get up, Cartman!

I don't know where Cartman is. I think something took him away.

Some high schoolers left their marijuana cigarette behind. Uh we have to throw it away before some kids find it or something.

L-look, I was just suggesting that maybe this one person could control what he said, but just didn't, for fun.

Yeah!  We'll show them! 

What?

Dude, when he gets out of Juvenile Hall, he's gonna wanna kill us!

Oh, dude, I don't know how I can take it.

Yeah, I noticed that too. Let's go get some ice-cold lemonade.

Oh God! I do?

Dude, I was having this horrible nightmare that we were at this house, and it was filled with Cartmans!

Dude, I think it might be best for us to never piss Cartman off again.

Dude, I'm not going to lose to Cartman's stupid turd sandwich. 

All right, cool.  Let's download some Metallica, and some Stevie Wonder. 

Here you go turkeys! 

Oh, you're just saying that because he brings you candy.

This ride better be good!

Well, I turned off all my Apple stuff. They can't locate you if you don't have your stuff on, right? 

Yeah! And fried chicken! 

Cartman!

Stop dude! You're gonna scramble his brain!

Come on, limey, don't be a wuss! Are you just gonna be a little French pig your whole life?

Yeah.  Oh, here he comes.

This is how they talk to us!  You'd better watch your mouth, kid!

If you visitors can hear me- 

Yeah, we've shown them amusement parks and malls. How can you expect them to go back now??

Yeah. Everyone thinks I'm a homo now.

STOP!

No.

Alright, we don't know for sure why Cartman is ditching school, but it has something to do with abortion. That's all we know.

Right. But he can't live with the guilt anymore. Because, even if Jesus wasn't really the Son of God, he was still a nice guy. And he didn't deserve what happened to him in Mel Gibson's movie. I I can't sleep at night. I mean, my... friend can't sleep at night.

Hello? Will you just give this guy something, please?!

I found the number for a really cheap airline to Canada. If we go as soon as possible, then-

When I say "go," you slam your electric wheelchair into high gear. Okay, Timmy?

Okay, will you let Muhammad come to South Park if we dress him like a pirate?

Fine, I will! 

Me too.

No! Chef, they've filled your head with lies! Can't you see that??

I don't know. 

Hey, are you going to come to Ike's bris this weekend?

Dude, there's a guy with a gun here!

Cartman? You'd better be studying, God-damnit! 

Okay, Not-Kenny.

What?

That's terrible!

So then where did the eight hundred dollars we made from selling an Internet ad to Payless Shoe Source go?

All right, let's just say all the bad things said about Mr. Jefferson are lies! Let's say the police department does just go around spending their time framing people for crimes they didn't commit!  Let's say it's all made up, and Mr. Jefferson is just a nice guy who's trying to be a child because he never got to have a childhood. Well that's fine, except for that he HAS children now! And when people have children, they have to grow up!

Maybe we need to make students think they have to watch our news show or they'll die.

Is he in there?

Oh no! They're closed!

You threw it away, Cartman! It's mine now.

Token?

But Dad, I want-

What the hell are you talking about?!

It's only three days until Christmas, you guys! You know how bad things have been around here. I think it might be because Mr. Hankey hasn't come.

It's Mr. Hankey! I think he's in some kind of trouble. 

Yeah, that's weak!

That's not true, fatass! I have red hair, and I don't have to avoid the sun!

Dirty bitch.

You seem tired, Stan.

Dude, it's a Peruvian flute band.

Heeey Ike! Look what I got.  The new Call Of Duty! Do you wanna go downstairs and play?

Oh no, no, nonono.

Ow! What the hell was that for?!

Dick Cheney?

Come on, dude. I wanna get out of here.

Because why?

Dude!

What?

Okay, fine, I will!  H-wait a minute! I don't even want one copy of Time Cop! 

But that's not fair! You lied to me!

Damn, what a freak!

You have your crutches!

So, do you uh, do you have any brothers or sisters, Natalie?

Wrestling is awesome!

How about a brain transplant? 

Uh no.

If we can go in, and get the GameSphere in 30 minutes, we could still be back at your house playing video games by midnight!

Yeah. I I think so.

That's not scary, fatass!

Oh, yeah.

No.

Uh…yeah…we want to crossbreed an elephant with a pig.

Ike! Ike, what?!

No. They're not a part of your betrayal?

She's not eating it, it's just coming out her backside!

Well, yes, I think so.

Alright, alright! If it means that much to you, take the stupid triangle!

Aw, come on. Ned's faking it. That frog was just a piece of plastic!

Hey guys. Guys! Hold up.  Hey uhm, you're kind of friends with that Nichole girl, right?

Huh?

Wait! We'll do it.

Don't you just feel a little bad for Clyde?

You!

Goddammit, Cartman! You only got that because you knew my mom would buy it for me!

Someone who wants a favor.

Dude, you've been sitting at your locker crying since lunch break. Clearly, something's going on.

What the--

Hehe. Why the hell did you dress up like Raggedy Andy dude?

Do the right thing. Show Mohammad.  Do. The right. Thing.

Then why didn't you tell us?!

Why are they all out driving at the same time?

(Yaaaaah!) 

Which song is that?

Dude, I don't think Kenny's coming back. My dad said those Child Protective Services people are pretty serious.

W-well, 'cause we want all of those fags to get out of town.

Maybe you got brain cancer.

Hey Jimmy. What's up?

Come on, Marvin! We've gotta get your people to Marklar before the missionaries do!

Oh God, here we go again.

I, I know it's tough but-  Look at me!  I know it's tough, okay?! I know! But we have to be tough right now!

I don't know, I didn't read them!

But we certainly want to thank you for all your hard work and attempts at being our friend, lame as they were.

Congratulations, sister. You have heard the noble truth and are now a Blaintologist.

Doesn't matter. You're gay now.

No shit!

You're just jealous he's a better psychic than you.

I am doing it.

Boy, do we ever.

Wow. Did he say that in the Bible?

Yeah, you can have a drink of water. The dispenser's over there. 

PewDiePie?!

The Earth show can still be good. Just erase everyone's memory so we don't know we're a show.

Throw it away, Clyde!

Chef.

No, he sure doesn't.

I'm in big trouble, you guys! We have to do something!

Or if you sold one to an "Eric Cartman"?

Wow. That's a lot of sea men you've got there, Cartman.

We've gotta keep this away from him.

No, I don't think so.

Jesus, man, those Earth Day people don't screw around!

You see, we've learned something today. Swearing can be fun, but doing it all the time causes a lot of problems.

Wait a minute. There's only four of us.

Dude, it's totally fine.

Who is that guy?

Do what you want, don't have restraint.

Hoh, that sucks, dude.

What are you talking about, dude?! I fell down that abyss and there it was!

Cartman, are you still trying to become a lesbian?!

To the Genetical Engineering Ranch.

Aw crap.

Yeah. 

He'll be here. Stan wouldn't douche.

Hey dude.

Aw, come on!

...Do you realize how retarded that sounds?

How's it goin', dude?

Hooray for the earth! We must protect it.  And now, as promised, here are TERRANCE AND PHILLIP, on video! 

Well, cou, couldn't just you know, get rid of the part of Tooth Decay?

You're on, dude. 

No no! The word, "shit".

Oh Jesus! 

I know that I often have serious moral objections to the things that you do, but... this time I think you really need to reconsider, because if you do this, I believe you will go to hell. So I feel it is my responsibility, as your friend, to tell people what you're doing, and to put a stop to it!

Cartman, you hike me the ball, then somebody run, and I'll throw it at something. Ready?!

You don't?

Oh no!

He's fat and he's stupid?

What? You want me to lie?

Yes, but he thrives on that.

But, everyone thinks I was responsible for 9/11.

Dude… Chef is gone.

Well, our pig hasn't given birth yet, but she should anytime now.

What are you doing?

Yes!

Will you please take your rally conversation somewhere else?

Oh, what the hell?! 

He won't listen to us, but he would listen to- Gordon Ramsay.

No, we really want nothing more to do with these people.

Boars?

(NOOOO!) 

Kick it!

When Cartman first opened the door, and saw the Thompsons, he felt bad for playing a joke on them. Now that everything's turned out alright, he's able to laugh.

Yeah. We're gonna call you Fartboy from now on.

There.  I think we got it.

We got six days to make it to Los Angeles. If we keep our stops to a minimum, we should be able to get the episode pulled just in time.

Together we are strong! 

Gentlemen, we are off! 

Why's your sister so mean to you dude?

Disintegration is the best album everrr!

Don't hurt anybody, sir. We could try and fix this.

I got a job, Stan. I am making tons of money doing some really cool stuff.

Hey, are you guys gonna come to Ike's party this weekend?

Shut up!!

Dude, why'd you make that deal? If we're out buying tampons, we'll miss the trailer anyway/

We have to watch them! We can't miss it!

You know why! Because we're trying to keep our parents from watching murder porn!

I can't take it anymore! I gotta go volunteer, dude! 

How do you murder a stuffed animal?!

I'm not really happy.

Ah! Oh God! Oh God!

Please you've, you've got to believe me! They've still gotta be here somewhere! Uh we've got to find them!

You mean, throw the game? You know how our parents are about this sport.

Oh my God...

Okay, my turn. 

Over a hundred.

I'm sorry, Kenny!

So what do we do?

Well, we helped.

We were throwing rocks at cars.

Whoa!

Oh yeah, time travel.

Trent Boyett?! The kid from preschool?!

Look, I know it isn't exactly what we wanted, but maybe we can train it.

The question is, "Where is the heart?"

Huh.

What? You mean like you don't like the singing, or the lyrics, or what?

Butters has that at his house?

Yeah, sorry dude uh, I can't make it either.

...What?

Here! Here! Look at this. It says "The succubus enchants its victim with an eerie melody. This is the Succubi power. Only playing this melody backwards can vanquish the succubus power."

Fuck you!

Me too.

I knew you were!

Okay, molestered, bad touch.

Mayor! We have the solution to your problem.

I need to get a nurection for my dad.

Www-what do you mean?

Oh wait. Wait, I'm supposed to play here.  Hey, Mick, w-would you mind if I stepped out for a sec?

I can't believe my parents are cannibals!

Cartman, there are people in the world who really have Tourette's Syndrome. This isn't funny!

Mr. Garrison, where's Mr. Hat?

Then why did Butters say he helped you sneak into my room last Friday night?! 

Wow, dude, Terrance got really fat.

But you need to understand: we have a whale here that needs to get back to his family on the moon.

Butters?

Maybe the problem is we don't have very good stories to report on.

Dude, they don't care we knocked Butters' eye out with weapons?

Okay, so what's the plan?

Well whattaya mean?

What do ManBearPig droppings look like?

No! Because you'll just crap out your butt and then say it came out of your mouth!

Nuh-uh!

You sit- 

Well why don't you just tell people the truth?!

Wagh. 

We can't get out! The flames are too big!

Who said that?

Oh God. What have I done?

Do you think we did a good thing, Stan?  I mean, no one even seemed to notice.

Dusty the dirtball

Well, I fell down this ice cavern,  and I saw this block of ice, so I told my friend to throw a rope- 

Look, maybe he's forgiven us. I mean, we were only in preschool

I need your help!

Do you mind telling us what the hell is going on??

I know! I was lying then!

I have to get online before school.

God-damnit! Now, what the hell are we gonna do?!

What the hell are you doing telling people that we're a gay couple?!

Yeah, it's going to be this weekend.

We uh, we have special permission?

Now she's doomed to walk the earth in limbo. 

I can't reach the CPU.

Dude, because! You have to stand up for yourself! So will you fight him? 

The only way you can cancel it out is to get Butters to put your wiener in his mouth.

Dad?!

They never grow old because they die before they're 30!

He does?

Mister... Jackson, y-you aren't alive. You're in purgatory.

So, do you agree to fight him after school?

That's the chemical equation for gold?

Yeah! Let's see how they like it!

Then we'll wait, because we have to clone Muhammad now!

Why?!

Kick the baby! 

You can't just roll into places and take people's lives away!

I know, fatass. I was there.

That does it! I know what I have to do! 

We have reached the Great Pass of Mount Ururalak.

I just... thought it'd be nice.

I don't know.

God Dammit!

Just get the hell out of here, Cartman! You're not serious and you're a detriment to the band!

You need to stop recommending that app to people!

Dude. 

Nothing. 

Awesome!

Yeahyeah, Mom. I-I can't go to the lake. No, S-stan's having emotional problems and I need to help see him through it. He's got-  wha-what is it?

Again?

I've been thinking, how did shamelessness get to this?  Did it start with fat people on scooters? Or did the bar get lowered way before that? And then I started thinking, maybe it was us.  I don't know, but maybe somehow, we lowered the bar, a long time ago.  And now we're all sittin' here in the stink of it all.  There's no going back, Stan. 

Heee might not come if you're too close to the toilet bowl, Ike.  Come sit by me. 

The judging's almost done. You're gonna make it.  Oh God.  SOMEBODY GET ME A CHARGER!  Hold on Stan! Don't die on us!

What's he doing at his teacher's house?

Yeah, you have to hit him.

How was what?

Mr. Hankey!

What do you wanna do now?

Rotten, they're both really drunk, but the won't have sex.

Hey wait. I think maybe I have Attention Diffunction Disorder.

Will you get out of my living room, please?!  Hello?!

Oh come on! It's obvious what happens! I get killed by Santa Claus so that Christmas is saved!

Platform 4F. Uhhh, it must be on the other side of the station.

Can we just get going, please?

I know that I'll have to testify, that I'll have to... relive what I saw that day.  But I can't let Spielberg and Lucas get away with it. Not this time. Even if I have to do it alone.

Oh. Okay, it's over this way 

My guess would be 'yes.'

This whole time your stupid story was just a way to rip on me for being Jewish at Christmas again!

Hey dude, how'd it-? 

Dude, what the hell is going on?! Why did they replace Phillip?

You'er not staying at my house either.

And afterwards, he'll probably have to burn his hand and bury it.

I thought you didn't care about Wendy anymore.

This is terrible, dude! Maury Povich parades these poor people around on his show like carnival freaks! And then gives them prizes at the end after they joked about it. What a dick!

I guess there's nothing we can do. Chef likes her more than us.

You get away from me, you crazy woman! 

Alright, dude, take off the headset. 

Jesus, dude.

Just tell us where Lemmiwinks is being held prisoner so we can kill this stupid rat!

This is gonna be fun.

Dude! Nobody wants to hear you commenting on things!

He's here! 

Yeah, fine, Dad.

I don't know how you do it, dude. How do you get up in front of that many people?

Wait a minute. Ha-how the hell did these two guys end up here?

Here, give me some money, Cartman!  Lend me money, fat boy!

Stan?

What's the matter dude?

Hey. Aren't you guys the underpants gnomes?

Don't you "Oh, brother" me! She's the woman of my dreams!

I think he wants us to get in.

Dad, Dad, Jesus Christ!

Who is this?

Alright, look. I honestly don't know the secret, dude. Only Cartman does, and that's how it's gonna work for us.

No... No!  No...

What?!

What are you talking about?!

Beause he's a fat racist self-centered intolerant manipulating sociopath!

Open the gate! 

Hey, Craig.

Don't worry, dude. That little truck just runs on D batteries. It's gonna run out of juice soon. 

Kenny, who found the ice man?

Butters, you know goddamned well you didn't write that book!

Ma'am, please, I think my little brother needs immediate help.

Here.

You're not gonna die, Kenny. Don't be stupid.

Wow, cool!

It's working! They're turning back to normal.

Dude. What's wrong with you?

I can't deal with it, Stan. I mean, all the stuff I've been reading; I really don't think I exist!

Ih-it'll be okay.

Alright, it's working!

Anyways, I need you guys to help me so that my parents don't realize Ike is gone.  Knock it off, asshole!

Huh.

Hell no! I'm not being part of a four-member boy band! We'll look stupid!

I have to show you something.  I think it will change the way you feel about your impact here.

What?

Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,

Y-you alright?

Take a look, fatass! I beat you! You aren't going on Dateline; what have you got to say now?! 

Kenny, aren't you a little young for this?

Chef, there's a new kid in school, and he's a total weirdo freak.

The Internet?

Stan! Stan, wake up!

Hey, what are you guys doing? 

Stan, people in Beaverton are still trapped on their roofs. Nobody's helping them because they think they can't go outside.

Look, Cartman, I don't know what's gotten into you, but... I I think it's pretty amazing. And I think it's real. You have to understand why I didn't believe you before.

I love you too.

Oh my God!

Oh for sure, dude! It's the most God-forsaken place on the planet! Things are finally gonna be normal around here.

I know your family's poor, but you can't just eat an entire bowl of mints for dinner.

Let's go somewhere. 

Rocket ships?

Yeah. And now you can take that stupid beard off! 

Giant douche.

Yeah, I hate you, but I'm not going to help kill you.

Nuh, it's more important than that. Our school is putting on a big show for Earth Day, and we promised people we could get you to perform.

What did she say?

Wait! You know what we should do? We should all take a bunch of cough medicine!

That should do it.

I beat out YOUR fat ass, Cartman! 

Fine!

I should have known better! You never cared about my birthday at all!

Look, let's just get our money from EA Sports and get out of this whole thing once and for all!

There's a Hillary Clinton campaign rally.  Cartman? ...Cartman? 

Yeah. We've come to complain. We don't want a Wall-Mart in our town.

Well, I guess it's mostly the way Mr. Garrison stuck a gerbil up Mr. Slave's ass.

What?!

Garrison is taking us all on a field trip today. He wants to do the final egg check in front of the Governor's office!

No. Way.

So, tobacco helped to build America.

Mr. Garrison, didn't the guy who shot John Lennon say it was because of this book?

...How?

What the hell is wrong? "Can't find the server" Kickstarter. 

The digital sports watch is here.

Yeah.

Man, I guess sometimes we let our technology and stuff grow too fast.

Good guess, dude!

Sally Struthers, dude. She used to be on Full House.

We're not basing research for our report on this crap!

Clear!

Yeah.  What is that?

No-o-o-o-o!

Stan! Stan!

Hey, Butters!  I got tickets to go see Lion King tonight, and I decided to invite  YOU before anybody else.

Why are you doing this to us?!

Well, what's the Evil Power?

Why are you walkin' so funny Cartman?

I dream about it every night. Every time I close my eyes I see us just running away, running while they ray-rape him over and over again.  And because we did nothing... they got away.

Cartman flooded Beaverton?!!

Aw man.

If only we had realized how special our time with his gigantic ass was.

It's like the Disneyland of Mexican restaurants.

You have to stop!

Butters! Hey Butters! You have to check this out!

Hey! We're fourth-graders now, too!

Knock it off! Right now! This isn't funny! At all!

The past...four nights we've tried to play, he shows up and kills us!

We're firemen!

Mr. Hankey.

Agghh!

Dude! Dude, Kenny, calm down!

Oh crap, it's him!

I don't know. But there's gonna be lots of food, and a band.

What?!

God damn it Cartman!

Hey, wait! There are children in here!

Costumes and candy.

I don't know.

I'm going to put it in my room, where Cartman can't find it.

Kenny! Watch out! 

Oh yeah. Tom Cruise does have Seaman on his back.

You can't do this! We were gonna build an orphanage! So the crack babies have somewhere to go!

The thing is, Ms. Claridge, we did a lot of stupid things when we were kids.

Sooo, theoretically, if someone was to step in, it would beee, okayyy?

Well no, not really. It's the Kindergarten teacher, Miss Stevenson.

You do??

You wanna bet?  Let's go ask my Dad right now!

Ow! 

Cartman, you're such a fat ass that when you walk down the street people go "God damn it, that's a big fat ass!"

Hey Chef.

Okay, we did it.

Do with us what you will, Mr. Lucas!  But please, don't change Raiders of the Lost Ark.

U-u-uh, hi. 

Ow. Quit it!

Thanks. 

You... missed school today?

Heh, don't, don't tell him what it is, dude.

You were scared Cartman! you almost peed in your pants!

Hah hah hah!

What??

Happy Passover, Cartman. 

-slashed the bus tires in Arkansas! I said so! I told you the minute that I-  -and I told you that-

Dude. 

Thanks, Mr. Garrison.

Yeah!

Alright, alright, let's calm down! I know we're all concerned here!

That's, that that's k-kind of what I was thinking.

Don't. Touch me.

Well, we've all talked it through and we've come up with a theory.

Dude, what actually makes total sense about it, if you look at it, is that the crack babies are finally getting some attention and the care that they need.  Yeah. It's pretty cool, dude. Because most of these babies would normally not even get out, you know? Huh, or be able to do anything.  Just because we are making money doesn't mean that those babies aren't benefiting. It isn't exploiting them. They're finding a useful place in society. What's so unethical about that? 

Guys, can I talk to you?

Ike, you can't come to school with me. 

Hey, look! 

But the window isn't locked.

Shut the hell up, Cartman!

Damnit, Cartman, that's not funny!

So how much done is that?

Tell us what you know right now!

Yyeah, except maybe it's not perfectly great, because to some degree, Ike and Ms. Stevenson are having an-.

And then we won't have to show anybody the picture Kenny has of you guys sucking each other's jagons.

I mean, come on guys, that's pretty cool, right? My little brother is a knight in Canada. 

...Homeland Security?

You fat piece of shit!

Oh. Thanks, dude.

Uh, can we sit down?

The old Pioneer Village off of Kipling.

Goddamnit. We're gonna take a short break. Be back in five. 

Butters, we are sick! Don't you get it?! We're gonna end up just like Kenny!

Cartman, what the hell are you doing here?! You quit!

Dad! You tasered my dad!

I said, 'Larry King won't grant me three wishes.'

Well it's just that, eh, this seems like another one of those times when things are gonna get way out of hands, you know? It's been happening a lot lately. How about this time we just put a stop to it right now?

I'll bet you can't.

Kenny, you're clearly his best friend. Go stop him.

Uh, okay. Then what?

Why did they search us? That marijawana never even made it to us.

But what about Mr. Garrison? He can't go back.

What??

Then why did you send us the goat?

Aw, blow it out your ass!

Stop it!

Just stick it on.

Well, I finally got my family to use the living room for an hour each night.

What?!

I'm thinking about it!

Why does it matter?!

Who? Me? Why?

Dude, why is your store called "The Indian Burial Ground Pet Store?"

Hey dudes.  Sorry I couldn't make it yesterday. What'd you guys do?

Yeah.

Wait!  You're all making a mistake!

Oh, sorry dude.

Give me the drum, and you play the flute.

We can't wait here any longer! Dude, we've gotta get him out of here or he's gonna die.

Cartman, what's going on?!

You still didn't get a costume Kenny? 

Nothing.

That kid and I had a long talk! I told him he was on a slippery slope to becoming a monster like you!

Haha, hehahaha.

Purgatory? What's that?

Hey!

Okay.

Chef!!! 

..What the-?

I want two tostadas and mild sauce.

Can I just get some Goddamned tater tots?

When Kickstarter went down, many saw their startup projects die, but here at Washington Redskins, we saw opportunity. People still need a way to raise money for their stupid startup projects, and with the Redskins you can now go fund yourself.  And the idea is simple. You, the people, go out and raise all your own money, and give the Washington Redskins 5%.

God, this is gonna be sooo yummy.

Yeah.

What's Cuba?

Okay, Ike. You're my little brother, so I have to show you how to celebrate Hanukkah.  This is called a dreidel. You spin it and see where it lands. And you sing this song:
I have a little dreidel; I made it out of clay.
And when it's dry and ready, with dreidel I shall play. Oh,
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay.
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with dreidel I shall play.

Just make sweet love down by the fire.

No!

No, we don't want to enter any of your stupid shelter!

Hello. 

Pulling an episode because someone is offended starts a chain reaction. You'll have to pull more and more episodes until the show goes off the air completely. It's what happened to Laverne & Shirley.

What do we do?!

Aw Goddamnit, now you've made me miss my ride! My whole day is screwed up because of you! 

Hm. 

You don't like anything, Cartman! 

The stop drinking Double Dew, fatass!

We wanna buy M-80s.

No way!  You do it, Kenny!

They said they'd come.

Huh? No.

...I'm kind of finger painting right now.

Come on, Blanket! We gotta go before your dad sees us. 

The outside of the device seems to be covered in numerals. Inside are colors... which must open up to some sort of temporal time warp.

Aw man, here we go again! Use the Jew as a scapegoat.

Man, I can't believe how much people want us to get our winning ticket back.

Aww, come on, you guys! It's supposed to be really cool.

...And then it got attacked by terrorists?

Hey! What the hell are you doing?!

No, I don't! I don't care!

Dude, did you hear what's happening?

That's pretty cool, dude!

I didn't come to stop you. I... I think you're right, Cartman. I want to help you get the Family Guy episode pulled.

I'm gonna take Butters. He invited me to his birthday party last month, so I owe him one.

Well, maybe we will, maybe we won't.

Now, that's what I call a sticky situation. 

Here, this one's from me, Stan.

Yeah, there's this guy named Jack Leborkian that goes around and murders people that ask him to, and he doesn't get in any trouble at all.

No. I found this frozen guy in the woods today.

Fine!

If someone says they saw a Sasquatch, they are either lying or they are stupid. Now stop lying about a Jewpacabra before stupid people start believing you!

The... girls at school. They made a list and voted me the ugliest boy.

Yeah. I'm sure whatever that Super Adventure Club does is pretty tiring.

Is it illegal for Jewish people to eat Christmas snow?

I really thought it was gonna last.

We'll dub his voice over.

Alright, dickhole! 

Don't do it, kid. 

No way!

Hang on, Cartman! 

You get in trouble again, Cartman?

Cartman, this is serious!!!

I'm back.

Damnit! 

Really? What about?

Don't even start! Don't even start, Cartman!

No way, dude, then I'd have to suck Cartman's balls

Hey, Pip. Do you wanna be on my team again?

Give it time, it'll grow on you.

Yeah. I bet they could make a fake set of balls. Come on, Butters!

Awgh, dude, I can't look. 

Cartman? Cartman saved the day?

We made two dollars.

What? Why?

No way! 

What, you been living under a rock? This is the new meme, Cat Taylor Swift Reporting.

Hey, uh, Jimmy, can we talk?

This is serious, you fucking asshole!

Ah, I told you we shouldn't have brought him to school dude.

I will if you give me money!

Yeah! Like Stan gives a crap if Wendy breaks up!  Stan? 

But Mom, I-

I'm stoked my cousin is comin' to live with us. It'll be just like having a brother. 

Okay so, what exactly are we doing now?

Everyone came as Chewbacca?!

But I...

I'm sailing away

Google him. He's this guy from Sweden who has over 30 million YouTube subscribers. We didn't even know, but he's a bigger celebrity to kids than anyone. It just seems so lame.

You know, I didn't even get home until 2:30.

That's right.

Yeah. I cross-referenced his MySpace page with realtor.com. His parents moved into that green house on Janice Street.

Yeah, that one.

And that applies to all of us, doesn't it? Even though it's convenient to have things done for you, sometimes it's best to deal with it yourself. 

Finally!

What did you do?!

Stan! It worked!

That was the dumbest ride I've ever seen!

Communists?

But it isn't right!

Mister Father!  We have to ask you something.

Hey. Ms. Crabtree had that little TV, for the trainng video? Maybe we can watch TV on it.

Sick?

Sir, we would love to sign your wife.

Okay, there. Now we can carry this egg around in this case without it getting cracked.

You're not an awesome teacher!

Doctor, could we talk to her for a minute?

But now let me tweet this for you all to comment upon.
The more connected we get, the more alone we become.If you want change like I do, and feel the same gloom,Then please follow THIS trend, #savethelivingroom

Yeah, fatass, we're gonna dig up-  Dig up Kyle's dead grandma??

Admit you're lying, and I'll let you go.

There's no such thing as Mr. Hankey.

Cool! We'll see what we can find, ma'am.

But if I stop now, I'll just be going with the group again. So, to be an individual, I have to bomb Pearl Harbor. See ya. 

Yummy yummy yummy can I please Cartman's farts in my tummy?

I don't know.

Oh Jesus.

Come on, dude, somebody needs to wipe that fuckin' smirk off his face!

Hey. Do you live here?

Uh wu we weren't sleeping, Mr. Garrison.

What happened? 

Dude, get out of here! I'm peeing.

What happened?

Who cares? My parents deserve whatever they get. They're liars and cheats.

Then that's it. I'm... I'm never going to get my brother back. 

They're not gonna show that stupid-ass Godzilla movie again, are they?

Wing?

Wow, that's cool!

My company was on Kickstarter too! Why would I get rid of it?!

You guys, check this out! 

We're gonna teach that fat bastard a lesson!

Just let us see your iPad, Cartman.

Quick, hide Butters! 

I got some sound advice... from an old friend. 

Café World.

Something must have happened to Chef while he was gone. Maybe he hit his head or, or got stuck in some quantum time vortex.

Is that what you learned in sex ed?

Aagh! For Christ's sake, Cartman, when was the last time you changed your socks?

Dude, you don't understand, I'm a Jew. I have a few hang ups about killing Jesus.

But I'm gonna be Royal Crown Chinpokomon Master!

Yeah.

Please, you have to listen to me! The prophecy actually did come true!

This is nuts.

Argh!

Dammit! Son of a bitch, dammit!  Oh, sorry.

Ugh! We're gonna end up watching this whole retared Russell Crowe show!

Ugh! Those dirty liars!

What? Ready for what?

Uh, I think so.

Why are you people doing this? Why would you lie like this? To children?

All I wanted was to play one level of Call of Duty and you know what Ike told me? He said the living room was for old people.

Timmy.

Hang on, I'm chaining my fire spells for max range.

No they didn't.

He said the Muslims beat them here-  God damn it!

Yeah. That'll make 'em look stupid!

Aaaah! Runrunruuun! 

Fifty-five daura.

They laughed hardest at our video. We're gonna win!  We're gonna win!

How come the visitors aren't coming for him?

Dude, this is probably the best episode they've ever done!

I've designed it to be the best place for them to live. A place where they can finally have the care and happiness they deserve. And if you think it's a bad idea, I really don't care!

Hey, wait a minute. How come Ike's tombstone has the Canadian flag on it?

It's not true! 

Dude. Have you been drinking?

Gahhh! 

Don't worry. There's gotta be another cash for gold place around here somewhere.

We're sorry.

You were right. 

...What?

Oh-- Noooo!

We've got to get rid of them.  Nobody should have the kind of power Barbra Streisand wanted! 

Get up, Cartman! You're still not staying on long enough! 

Dude! What if Cartman really does succeed? And we really do have to be his slaves??

Yeah?

Ah, Mr. Hankey?

What does that do?

Screw you, Cartman!

Then I guess I'll see you on Black Friday.

He's dead, Cartman! 

What the hell is going on?  Hello?  Excuse me, I need to get to Los Angeles.  Hello?! 

I can see clearly now, the rain is goneI can see all obstacles in my way-

Well, I mean, all last week you were ripping on ginger kids and now you are one.

I heard you won't even get in the deep end.

Pip  Jimmy  Jason  Towelie  Luigi .

He's a little young, don't you think?!

You, I gu-I guess you're kinda right.

Righ!  Okay, good.

Cool. Thanks, Jimmy, well, I'll check it out.

Mung's good.

What?!

Yes. Three friends. You're not my friend.

Dude, my mouse-clicking finger hurts.

Go. 

Arrghh!

Dude. What the hell is wrong with you?

So what?!

Thanks, Towelie.

How do you know? You weren't even there.

You figured that out, huh?

It's the biggest night of the year.

Yeah.  HEY, WHEN ARE WE GONNA GET TO SOME ACTION, HUH?

Kaii yo! 

You dirty son of a bitch, you never told us that we had to win-

Stan! 

Come on, dude! I can do it! I'm sure!

I know, I know. Be cool.

Well like we said, we didn't know whether or not we should care?

Yeah, you're not a lesbian, fatass.

You, you paid your friends tuh...  not make fun of me?

We did it! You see, Cartman? You won us the Terrance and Phillip dolls!

What?

Hey, Stan. What did the doctor say?

There is no brown noise, fat boy!

No.  Couldn't be.  Oh, my God.

Does anybody know anything about corporations? 

Jawas?

Aw come on now, people! 

Dude, did you finish your math homework? I kind of lost track of time last night.

Dude, that new kid is such a douche!

Dude! I've never seen Cartman care so much about something.

No way!

I have to watch out for my glasses. Ow! Ow, it's so cold! Oh Jesus! 

I'm not going to help you freeze yourself, Cartman! It's a stupid idea!

Naw.

...Remember when life used to be simple and cool?

That's it!  You're not getting high again until we have our Okama GameSphere back!

Look. You guys built a machine together that can bend time. If you'll just agree with him, you can build another one and usher in a whole new era of science!

I don't want to ask Mr. Hat, I'm asking you!

"Have mercy!"  Yeah ha ha!

What?

Oh, so big deal, guys! Do you feel better now? Clyde's the best looking kid in the class. And then Token and Stan, and last is Francis, Cartman, and...  Me?

You found a network to buy it?

Llook, I know I'm not the best-looking guy in town, but I I didn't think I was the very ugliest.

Ungh, it said in my book that the word, "shit", started exactly the same time as something called, "The Black Death".

We're not going anywhere without Chef.

Cartman!

Yeah, I don't know what to do with it, though. Well, see ya.

We could go to the city pool. They have a water slide

You guys! I got my period, too!

You bastards!

Hey, yeah!

A family! So THAT's why you haven't been able to spread Christmas cheer.

Uuuuuuhh...

'N Sync, Backstreet Boys, New Kids on the Block. All had five members.

Don't know, but it kicks ass.  Wow, dude, you're the luckiest kid in South Park.

Hoh Gohod, I popped it!! Oh hit huhurts!!

Terrible. Every time I close my eyes I see the house we TP'ed. I see the tears of our art teacher and hear the screams of her daughters.

W-well, we've heard that she's...

Yeah, fatass, a dead body.

What??

I know.

Yeah, all the constellations look alike.

Really?

Yeah. It just proves we need to learn not to profile one race of people. Because, actually, most of the world hates us.

You know, you used to sit in the living room with your friends and family, and THEY were the ones commenting on whatever was on TV.

Come on! Let's go make fun of him!

Damn. That guy is the coolest guy in the universe!

So take a shit somewhere else!

We're his oral report buddies.

Oh yeah?! Well you're a stupid Jew! You're a Jew! Shut your God-damned Jew mouth! Good job, Jew! Jew... Shut up, Jew! You're Jewish!! Dude, he's Jewish! Jew! Jew! Jew! Jew! Jew! Jew! Jew?! "I told you Jewish people don't have rhythm." "Fuck off, Cartman!"

Aw, God-damnit!

There it is again! 

Ready to go hunting, Cartman?

I don't know. 

Alright alright Kenny, calm down. You're too young to be getting BJs anyway. It's good you and Tammy are making a commitment to each other that isn't based on sex.

Yep, that's great. 

Well then we're gonna end up freezing his hellish heart with a cool island song.

Uhhh-woo wow! Isn't this great? You guys seeing each other again?

The Wall-Mart is imploding! Everybody out now! 

Yeah. Your fat ass isn't on the sled!

Stan, Stan, wake up!

Yeah, but dude, he seriously could have died in that fire.

He's right, dude. We have to define our style if we're ever going to make a platinum album. I mean, ah I'm a fusion guy, but Kenny's background is more Latin Jazz.

We do!

You just hate smoking, so you use all your money and power to force others to think like you. And that's called fascism, you tubby asshole!

How?

What is that?

Yeah, our friend has been missing for a few days, so we went and checked on him, and he's in a coma wearing your headset.

(Dude, I think you pooed a lot.)

Mr. Garrison, were you in Vietnam?

Hey, what happens to me in the future?

That bitch!

Really?

Oh God, no! 

No. We just have to show him that there's other girls out there. I say we take him to Raisins.

Dude, look!

Dude, this is the saddest commercial ever! Don't watch! 

Cartman?? Cartman, you see anything??

I went online posing as a boy who would have sex with older men, and told them to meet me here. My plan worked perfectly!  Whoa.

Dude, he's pretty dead.

Dude! Bulldozers rule!

Get away from me, Cartman! 

What the hell are they doing?

Why do you need me?

All right Stan!

Dad, can I borrow three hundred dollars?

Why do you have a video camera?

But we've been playing for eight hours. We can't think of anything else to do.

I didn't do anything to you. Timmy saw the turkey and wanted to get it. What do you want me to say to him?

I-Ike, this is a big deal. You have to be absolutely, 100%-

Where are we going?

Shut up, fatass!

Do you think kids in every town have to deal with this crap?

What secret truth??

I'll call the producers of the show. They'll help you find your dad.

Oh, good. Kenny's back to normal.

I saw The Passion!

Aw, hey dude. What are you doing here?

Yeah. Good luck with yours. 

All that work!

Re- really?

I wrote down... all the lyrics to the Happy Days theme song.

They're just drunk, Cartman! As soon as they sober up, they'll stop.

How exactly are we gonna use her to scare them?

Ah... a a a meth lab?

Aw crap! 

Come on, let's go!

Yeah. That's right.

But it's like eight pages long and they send me a new one like every three weeks! How can they know if I-

Hi. I've uh...  I've been saving up for a new Xbox game but... but I think you could use the money a lot more than I could. Listen I, I want you to take this.  It's twenty dollars. 

I'm Kyle.

...That's retarded.

What has Michael Jackson always tried to be?

Yes, but now we don't have any homework, so we can go see Timmy play downtown at Mile High Stadium

So how'd your date with Ms. Ellen go?

I don't think my mom would want me doin' this.

Cartman, what the hell are you doing?!

On Skippy, on Rainbow, on Patches, on Montel. 

Anthrax?!

I just have a feeling this might be the last time we get to do this.

And so, red hair, light skin, and freckles are all passed down genetically. A child's red hair is not determined by the lack of a soul,  but by the melanins which control the pigment in all of our skins. Thank you. 

Yeah.

We're thinking that a lot of people in town starting too... 

That's one twenty-fourth of a second of our movie already shot! 

Is that why there's crap on my doorstep every morning?

If she wants to be with you, how about you have her tell all these people here?

Look, he knows full well what he's doing, and he's just waiting for us to buy into it, and then he'll laugh and point at our faces and say, "Haha, I got you guys to believe me!" "You guys are stupid!"

But I never practiced quarterback.

Yeah.

He gave me AIDS!

I'm not sucking your balls; that's imaginary!

Me too. 

But Chef always helps us with our problems. When we have a problem, Chef sings to us and makes it better.

Come on, Stan. We're gonna play dodgeball.

So what?

Quick, Marvin. Get us to Marklar.

Uhhh, how d- how do we start this thing?

Will your sister let us watch it?

I'm confused.

Kenny's sick?

They told us he has a m-muscular disease. An and, that ...and that he, he might die. 

Huh?  What the?

Did you get your period yet, Stan?

You hear that dudes? We'll be rich!

Suck my balls, fatass.

I think the rabbit just crapped on my jacket.

Ooh, who the hell cares? He's not even my responsibility.

I can't believe I let you scare me into taking your side. You used fear to make me stop believing in free speech.

Sure. 

Hold it.  Pops, I've got the music inside me. It's in my soul. And I know my place is up on that stage. I'm gonna make it to the top. And I just want your blessing, Pops.

Yeah, I think that parents only get so offended by television because the rely on it as a babysitter, and the sole educator of their kids.

I knew it! You didn't plan 9/11 and you really didn't shoot that guy!

Token.  Clyde.  Craig  Timmy

Yeah, let's go. 

It's true. We think that word might be plaguing our friend, Kenny.

Yeah, we got it.

Good job, fatass!

About three minutes, fatass!

Check this out!

What the hell are you so happy about, fatass?! 

You motherfucker! 

That was cool!

Yeah, this is stupid! Books aren't magical. 

We don't wanna play dodgeball. It hurts.

Dude, you said you wouldn't say everything looked like shit!

Gays can get married? What??

You know what I mean! Why is my little brother watching you talking about us talking about him?!

Hey, who are those kids? 

Wow, that was easy.

...Oh. Kenny isn't special?

Oh... hey there. 

I can't wait to watch Terrance & Phillip with Bebe.

Hey, resurrection! That's what my dad needs!

Where are we?

Come on, Tweek! Blow it up!

Wwwait. 

No, I- I beat you!

I don't want to kill myself. They rigged this thing to fill with water! 

Get out!

Okay. "Woo" mouths again?

He's gotta show up. He's just got to.

Well, sorry's not good enough! What are you gonna do about it?

What gold??

No. No, it'll be okay!

Well, what about those two college guys next door to me? They're always doing science experiments in their basement.

Check it out, dude. The camera shoots one frame at a time. So, all we gotta do, is put the right mouth on, according to what syllable they're pronouncing at that frame.

Come on! Let's just get in our sleeping bags and get this night over with.

Kenny ate all the mints, dad.

I'm not better, I'm just... doing what needs to be done to make the world a better place.

Well, Cartman, thanks to you we don't have any money left to win the Terrance and Phillip dolls!

Wow, Cartman. You look... different.

No! No God damn it no! I'm telling you you're wrong! There, there's no way I can have HIV! Unless maybe...  Oh my God. That son of a bitch! 

No, I don't have sand in my vagina! I just think it's a little immature for us to be standing around talking about one dumb word being on TV!

Stan, it's over. You have to admit what you did so our parents could help us! 

Just what the hell is that thing?!

This is fucking retarded!

I think he said he wants to practice on a real bull.

Hey man, if you're Jewish you get presents for eight days.

Cartman?  Cartman??

Well, let's try the dictionary.  queasy, Quebec, queen quelch. No queef.

That isn't gonna work, dumbass!

Come on, this is ridiculous!

AAAAAAAAAAH!

Yes. I did! 

Which one is the good Cartman?

That is fucking stupid, Cartman!

...No, dude, that's Christmas.

I'm not going anywhere!

Triangle of Zinthar?

Hello?

See? We're just watching cartoons, like always. Nothing's changed.

Yes! Yes I will!

Yeah, screw him. Let's go.  Oh, finally! 

They were all out of 'em dude!

Come on, we've gotta go!

Hey you guys! Check out my sweet Chinpokomon doll!

Watch out Stan!  Genetic engineers are crazy. 

What do you want?!

Don't call my mom a bitch, Cartman!

Well, that's a public school. And in it there are children,  just like us.

Well, then you should. I think that a person has a right to die if they wanna.

Kenny!

No, no, no! Don't become an angry mob!  The last time we did that we killed Jesus!

Hey, you know, that nurse is actually pretty cool.

Hey, that's your song for Wendy!

Wagh.

Yeah. They think they're so cool.

We don't have a choice, dude. That guy killed our characters 14 times.

I don't know what else to do, dude. No matter what I try, me and Ike just seem to drift further apart!

Dude, look! 

He's faking.

Cartman, he's crazy!

Agh! Look, dude, we're on level 24, about to cross into the Caverns of Madness!

Dude, screw this! I don't wanna see anymore!

Hoh!

Dude, get away from me!

Because they're a bunch of assholes.

I am sooo sick of that stupid bitch! Blabbin' pussy little skank! Why do people talk on their phone like that?! I can't even get a minute of piece before that bitch walks in, holding the cell phone out like this , and talking on speaker phone! Nobody wants to hear your goddamned conversations, you little bitch! You're not that important!

I know...

All right.  All right, I guess it's possible.

You bastard!

No.

Yeah, isn't he just supposed to be learning how to read?

Hey, what's that?

Get the fuck out of here!

We have to speed this up!  Uh, can we collect our Internet money in front of you, please?

I know Cartman made it all up, okay?! I also know that nothing is more important for humanity than peace in the Middle East! I'm okay with this, Stan!

Me?!

Well? How was it, Cartman?

Cool.

Here.  We made ten million theoretical dollars. It's all for you. 

Come on guys! He's hidden them somewhere and we have to find them!

Thanks a lot for the ride.

You get a platinum album for selling one million copies, you fat turd!

Butters, you don't really believe that, do you?

Where's what?

Dude, everyone's trying to figure out who you are.

Okay, Not-Kenny.

Yes.

Dude, don't you see that it's not? It'd be like, changing Raiders of the Lost Ark!

They didn't play the Terrance & Phillip trailer again!

God-damnit, we need to get to the new Prime Minister! NOW!

Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,

No I'm not! God damn it Cartman, you're not gonna kill me off again!

Dude, did your dad know that the show was being broadcast live?

So now what do we do?

But you accepted money from the Canadian government! To push a freemium game on us! Why would they do that?!

Aw, I just hit my nose playing dodgeball.

There's a bunch of zombies here!

Yeah! You're a blood-thirsty succubus!

Dude, did you fart?!

You gotta come to Kenny's house with us.

Oh.

When we said "documentary," I thought we meant 60 Minutes, not Honey Boo Boo!

That's what bothering you? Not the fact that you're a murderer?

How big do they say mine is? 

And do I have to shovel the whole driveway, or just the side the car is on?

It's poetic justice.

Okay.

But... we were so close... I'm sorry, Willzy-x. We tried.

Dude, those people are pissed!

Dad! Somebody's at the front door!  Well am I grounded or not?!  Ugh. Fine! I'll get it! 

What's the matter dude?

Who are you?

Dude, this sucks ass!

You got it, Stan!

You're gonna stop bullying.

Quick! A monster of Rivendell!

What kind of extremists are these? 

Mr. Mackey, something's really wrong with Cartman.

I don't know.

Yeah?

Oh God! Oh God! I have to tell the truth!  Mooooomm! 

What?

You're too fat to be Jesus!

Oh yeah?!

He didn't even seem like Chef. He seemed like a empty shell of a man.

Yeah he's an idiot but uh I'm sorry, I just... I can't do this anymore, okay? I... I can't do this anymore! 

Hey! It's Tweek.

Come, on, Kenny! I'll give you five bucks to do it!

Okay.

Yeah, now finish 'em off! 

Yeah. I think I'm actually learning something. 

Yeah. If we're Jewish, are we gonna go to hell?

Uh alright, sorry kid. Gue- guess we have the wrong house.

I am sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Keller, but I'm afraid your daughter Helen still cannot see, hear, or speak.

Cartman.  Kenny's in the hospital.

You spent $10 and eight hours to unlock a stadium?

Looks like we're gonna have to go to Arkansas. Come on, guys. We're gonna put a stop to Wall-Mart once and for all!

You saw it in The Thing and you're wasting everyone's time!

Well dude, how the hell are we supposed to play it, then?

He's gonna be here any minute, Ike.

Well good for them. They shouldn't! The writers are standing up and saying they aren't going to be intimidated!

Do you?

Ex-cuse me?! If my little brother has been getting some athlete's hormones, then who has been getting Ike's medication?!

It was him. It had to have been him!

You're trying to confuse me now, aren't you?

Uhwuwhat?

Come on, fatass!

I know. But just like you, I feel like I have to try. People can really get hurt, and a joke just isn't worth that.

The first what?

Aaaah!

But we don't have years! If Chef keeps this up, he's gonna go to jail forever!

That isn't it, Cartman.

Why don't you take it to one of those pawn places? Every two blocks you see a guy with a sign that says "Cash For Gold and Jewelry." There must be a lot of people doin' it.

Ah I was just trying to... just, just in one instance... No. No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 

He's a talking piece of poo that lives in the sewer. But now he's getting sick because his egosystem is all out of whack because of all the extra poo in the sewer. If you don't all leave and go home soon, Mr. Hankey's gonna die. He's one of my best friends in the whole wide worldeh, and I don't want him to die. 

Is he bigger than a regular clone?

Totally. 

I heard it, too.

What's an anal probe?

Oh.  Uuugh.

Oh, thanks! 

Wing?

Just play the game, fatass!

Jambu? Jambu?  Cool! It worked! Hey, Jambu.

Our GameSphere! 

Dude, what kind of sick joke is that? Girls suck ass.

Copy, Fox trot, let's fly in the goods Tango.

Hang on! Wait! 

S-so you did superglue it.

You TP'ed a house last week, Cartman?

This fat fuck thinks he's PewDiePie! Because of him I can't get Ike to come out of his room!

Yeah.

Let's go, dude. We're ready.

Are we getting close?

Where's your dad?

Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with dreidel I will play
Second verse, same as the first
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidelll-I ma...

A boat ride?

Don't you think it's a little strange that Cartman keeps asking you to stay over?

I'm out of mana, I told you.

Shut up, fatass! Everyone knows I can spell better than you.

Cartman, I really, really have a problem with what you're doing. I object to it morally, and I find it grossly offensive. 

AAAAAA!

This is wrong. Uh this just doesn't make any sense. Why would Homeland Security send us into Peru?

But dude, you're making stuff up.

Kenny had a will?

Hi, uh- our friend has been brainwashed by some fruity little club.

Well, I attend South Park Elementary, ah-and... w-one of the teachers is having sssex with a student.

Token actually pays attention in school! Unlike you, fatass!

I think we should bail. If we leave the group, maybe other people will get the courage to leave, too.

Because- because that's not even entertainment! I mean, it's just, just, rehashing shit, isn't it?? It's like everything these kids are into these days, you know, it's just... rehashed shit!

Wait!  I may not have Santa, but I do have Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo.

Here's the thing: Whether or not I'm a part of it, crack baby basketball is popular. Somebody's going to do it. So the only way for me to try and help the situation is to be involved in it, so that I can steer things in a direction that is more beneficial to the actual crack babies.  Oh, it's sooo easy for you, isn't it? I mean, what do you have to do except lay there and think about what you did at school today, or what you want to watch on TV tomorrow? Well sorry, Skippy, but the world isn't always black and white! Just because some people are born poorer than others doesn't mean I can't enjoy a few McDonald's French fries in a hot tub of gravy from Kentucky Fried Chicken!

Kenny, what's funnier? A giant douche or a turd sandwich?

Dad.  Dad, Ike and I have been talking, and well, we feel that your new car is changing you.

Knock it off! I don't have your stupid picture!

Stan! Go get the other guys and tell them to meet me at the bus stop in ten minutes!

Yeah, I just... well I just thought our company name would be more like uh... or-original

But what are we gonna do?

This would have never happened if you would have let Kenny be a princess in the first place!

Fine,  then we'll shut our cable off altogether!

I just wanted to see if maybe you want to do fingerpaints with me.

You bastard! 

Okay, right behind Stan.

Let's do this together, dude.  Our only shot at playing any next-gen console is by teaming up. If you wanna game on a PS4, then I do too.

But our teacher, Mr. Garrison? He just had his penis made into a vagina. How come?

What the hell does that have to do with American history?

OOOOOHHHHH MY GOD!!

'Cause, r-tard, he's Stan from the future. He knows everything Stan knows.

Agghh!

I think I see the television department in the back!

Wait a minute. I though your father was your mother 'cause she had a penis.

Yeah, maybe starting a detective club isn't such a bright idea.

Oh no! The girls are gonna win!

Do we? He's a legend!

I am not sucking Cartman's balls!

D'awww sick! 

Yeah.

Hey Blanket. Uh, look, we're goin' over to help my dad chop wood. You... wanna come with?

But it's true, dude!

No he didn't kill him, he's still breathing!  Get up!  Get UP! 

Alright, what is it?!

Ma'am, we are a very important talent agency. If your producers knew you were forcing people of our stature to the back of the line, well-

So where's the KFC now?

What do you mean?

All right! Now, come on! We have to practice! 

Stan, do you pick giant douche or turd sandwich?

Hey! Let's pour them in the teacher's coffee tomorrow morning.

Ike? Iiike!  Ike! 

Yummy yummy.

Hey, dudes. What are you doin'?

No it's not, Cartman. You know, there really are couples out there who are missing children.

From what?

How are you rich?! Your mom pays for everything!

Gravy?

And so, thirty percent of the money we make off the licensing agreement with EA Sports goes to the orphanage for the needy crack babies. Did you see the blueprints? The babies will have their own putt putt golf course.  Why does it matter how much I'm making, Stan? If the crack babies are getting a place to grow and develop, why does my salary matter?

Dude, Mr. Hankey has magic powers. He can do whatever he wants. 

You're okay with everything you think going up on the Internet?

Dude. Being mature is boring!

What have we done? 

The blond kid?

Hold tight, buddy. We're gonna find a cure for you. 

Alright dude, we were going to the movies.

Not Cartman, he gets to be on TV anyway.

But why are you making such strange laws??

Why?

Cartman?

...What?

You unbelievable son of a bitch. You never cared about the Muslim religion. Or the safety of people in America. You just want Family Guy off the air!

You dumbass, Cartman! Now they're gonna go squeeze his balls!

What?!

Gorak's a gay name.

(No! That's not what I said! Vanilla paste!)

God-damnit! 

Coffee? I don't think I like coffee.

Dude, we're gonna see the new Zoopeeker movie!

Aaaargh! 

Oh. ...Thanks?

You should care! This strike affects everybody, fatass!

Because they're an addictive solution to a greater problem, causing disease of both body and mind with consequences far outweighing their supposed benefits.

Well, all my life I felt I was black! I've listened to hip-hop, I watch UPN and I love playing basketball! My body doesn't reflect who I am inside.

It was him, dude. I told you, it was Mr. Hankey!

Miss Stevens, you have a bug on your back.

How about... finkleroy?

What?!

We're with you, dude.

We've definitely not done that before!

Look, just go ahead and play, alright?  Leave me alone.  Can I get a Fresca, please?

Go for it, Pip. 

Stop it Cartman!

If it's on the school network we can track the IP address.  This way. In here.  Whoever it is using the computer in the music room.

Hey, here comes Stan.

Stop it! Stop!  Oh God! Oh God, help us!

I guess so.

I don't know.

Please, sir.

Yeah. Then it cancels out the gay polarity.

We're over here, by the cart. 

This is it. This one's for the game.

AAARGH! 

What

That's not true. Kids at school like us. Don't they?

What could it be? If only we knew what we were up against.

Thanks.

Shouldn't we hide her better than that?

Yeah. Okay, get over here, Clyde.

What do we do now?

Mom?! Where is Ike?!

I don't see it.

Copy that. 10 seconds, Cartman.

Maybe we are.

Yeah dude, don't get us killed too. 

Well, sometimes...

Parents. Mom. Dad.

He's doing it a-gain.

Larry and Brad Stoltsky

Yes, I did! I said from the beginning that you would do this!

Aw, just forget it! 

Umm. Dare?

Uuuh, n-no blood for oil.

Uh. All I did was show her how to-

Come on guys, we gotta go! 

We'll just have to keep throwing jabs to win the fight.

But ih-

Now what?

And Cartman for being fat.

How the hell do you have more friends than me?

Yeeah, you're welcome. I'm sorry I doubted you. And guys, I'm I'm sorry I acted like a know-it-all. 

Come on, Cartman! You haven't liked anybody else!

Well, why don't we make 3 o'clock?

I am not!

...And when she moved up and down, the little fetus jiggled.

Well, I have this friend, see? And this friend belongs to a certain, Chosen People of Israel. And it... so happens that these chosen people killed your Lord.

Sounds good.

This is how I look natural.

Yup.

Who the fuck are you?!

with dreidel I shall play.

Yeah, dude!

This must be it. 

Sweet! Let's go!

Nah, let him make a complete ass out of himself for a little while longer. 

Throw the ball, you stupid frog!  God-damn, maybe if you didn't eat all those croissants,  you'd be able to-- Ow! 

And in the end, I know that somewhere out there... there's the good part of Chef... that's still alive in us all. 

All right, now everybody take a tablet and a pencil.  and when all the ideas start coming, just write 'em down. We might not remember everything otherwise.

Hoh, Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,

Because you're standing over there! 

Uh, yeah! I agree! Uh- my fragile little eight-year-old mind didn't know how to deal with what I was seeing. C-Cartman should be punished!

Why? Why do I have to accept it when I can change it?

I can't wait until the teacher yells at us this time, and we all tell her to suck our balls!

Oh, "A I D E S," aides.

Hi, we'd like to speak to a  Professor Teabag? 

You guys. Somebody is following us.

I hate this town. I-I really really do.

Right.

Yeah huh!

Seven and a half.

No it isn't. Come on, I have an idea.

Okay, Cartman. You ready?

God-damnit dude, your mom and dad want you to come home!

...Thanks. 

So what happens to us now?

Okay, okay. Stan, you're right. Maybe I let being a martyr go to my head. Just please, let me stay on this path, and, I'll try to be cool about it. Okay? I'm sorry.

Jimmy, you're got to explain to the Germans that this is your fault, not ours!

It's okay, Ike. I'm here.

Thanks a lot, Ike!

Dude! I hate Mr. Derp!

You don't even know Heather!

Dude!

Butters, there's no such things as vampires.

Please...

...No, dude, that's not the trailer for Terminator 5, that really happened.

Dude, you're just jealous because I'm Chinpoko Master!

Dude, it just can't be better than ours. It just can't be.

Liberace gay.

I'm declaring Shenanigans on you! This game is rigged!

Why?

Dude! 

Barking vaginal belch.

I made you out of clay.

Did the tooth fairy come?

You've got to stop, Dad. If the South wins, me and Stan have to be Cartman's slaves!

Then you take care of him.

Can you guys meet me over at Cartman's house tonight at around midnight?

See? There you go again. Look at you dude. Look what you've become.

Well, as Abraham Lincoln, I accept your surrender, and agree to your conditions. You and all the Confederates will have all the S'more Schnapps you can drink for a year.

That's 15 people we got to agree to come see David Blaine perform in Denver.

Wow! Oh, and look over there, that's that Jake Jabs guy from American Furniture Warehouse commercials. 

I don't want you to jump them, retard!

Stan?  Stan, where are you going?

Dude. That's a pretty fucked up dream.

When the bar gets lowered, Token, we all pay the price. What if Honey Boo Boo was a little black girl? Being fattened up by her mom and talking about grits and hominy?

Go fuck yourself, Cartman!

It was pretty fun, wasn't it?

Yeah, they're gonna get busted again.

Ah, heck, Mr. Visitors, I'm just a kid all alone in this crazy world, but if you could find it in your hearts or whatever you have, to give my brother back to me, it sure would make my life brighter again.

You know what? At least Scott Malkinson has some self-respect! At least Scott Malkinson doesn't cave into peer pressure and start doing musicals!

You son of a bitch! Aaargh!

Come, see him with us.

It was really important for me to get an A, Stan. And Bebe said you were so reckless with your egg, so I made a fake one for you  and kept the original safe with me.

I'm supposed to go to the lake with my family tomorrow and swim and play in the stupid sun.

Officer Barbrady!

Huh?

Timmy, we already got a turkey.

We need to get our friend to a hospital right away!

Like you really need it, hippo-ass!

Can we take a lunch break now?

All right, all right, you could be Jesus, you tubby cry-baby!

Mr. Garrison, we've been watching Barnaby Jones repeats for eight days now. It's hard to keep paying attention.

Hey! Don't try to pass it back on me, fatass!

It's a long trip, dude. You're gonna need help. We can try and get the episode pulled together.

You don't think that-? But he isn't real.

Well, maybe we'll get ours soon, too. I'm gonna go and see if I'm bleeding out my ass.

Aaaa...  AH! Huh?! 

She's really taking this grade seriously, Stan. I'm gonna come over so that we can take our egg to school together, all right?

Uh, can you take my stupid glasses and put them on the night stand. Make sure they're close by, because that fish upset my stomach and I might need them if I have to go to he bathroom later on.

With genetic engineering, can you make an elephant smaller?

You bastard!

Bitch.

I looked on the known species webpage. There's no animal called a 'Jewpacabra' mentioned anywhere.

Dude, I think we broke him.

Cartman!

He’s not dying, Cartman!

WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE!

What is it, Butters?

Right. 

Wull, not on purpose.

Yes.  I love Cartman's farts.

Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastards!

Yeah, that'd be cool.

They are?

They killed Kenny!

Yeh-hah. 

Yummy yummy I want your farts in my tummy.

Dude, what's wrong with your leg?

So then we sit there for like, thirty minutes, because we had to wait for this couple who was running late. 

What?! No, you don't understand-

Oh.

Sorry, my mind's made up.

Yeah, dude. Your mom wanted you to have herpes on your face.

Wugh.

What's High School Musical 3?

Mrrh.  Mr. Garrison?

Dad, if you agree to something but you didn't mean to agree to it, what do you do?!

God job, fatass!

Only sixteen dollars? They can't be cool if they're only sixteen dollars. 

Can you believe it, Stan? I never thought global warming could happen so fast. I guess... I didn't listen.

Cartman doesn't always win! He just gets pissed off and goes home so we can't debate anymore!

You're saging these games do this on purpose?!

No, the nipples are more in the middle, see? 

Dude, I know you're pissed at me right now. You've gotta understand that I did it because I know in my heart that the XBox is better, for all of us.

Kenny, we need to have a serious talk.

Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo. Haven't you guys ever heard of it?

...Grrrr!!! 

Hey, thanks for going through all that to save my life, Stan.

Wow Cartman, the visitors dropped you off just in time to go to school.

So if you're identical, does that mean you all think alike?

Sick, dude!

We made it! It hasn't gone to commercials yet. 

That's just how God is.

This is so retarded, Cartman. You've got everyone believing your stupid story.

No! 

He said, not now, Craig!

Dude, when he gets out he's gonna be really mad!

Hey dudes.

Hey, uh, does anyone know who that guy is?!

We've just gotta stick together.

Will somebody just get me to a hospital? I need to get my stomach pumped!

Get him in the water!  Goodbye, Willzy-x! 

Don't be stupid, Cartman! Butters doesn't have that much blood in him!

Dad, can we go home? All you ever do since you got this car is drive around and show it off! 

What?

You weren't playing fair, dude. Getting your dad to work part time at the mall wasn't fair.

Okay, okay, you can have your powers back.

Your wiener is not 13 inches long!

"Dear Mommy and Daddy: I am running away. I am sorry, but I can no longer handle the monotony of middle-class life. Everyone at school is a fucking idiot, and if one more person talked to me about that Susan Boyle performance of Les Misérables I was going to puke my balls out through my mouth. I love you all, but I have to move on. I'm going to Somalia to be a-" to be a pirate?! Oh shit!

Please, sir. I traveled a long way to get here. He's the only person who can help me.

Your mom... uses Chipotlaway... to clean blood stains... out of your underwear?

Oh my God! I killed Kenny! You bastard!

We spent all afternoon learning about how we aren't actually happy. I had no idea how unhappy I was until today. They gave me this cool book to read, and I'm already on chapter four....

No, the XBox's are gonna be better.

You bastard!

We're not too late! 

You have to go with him, Ike.

Okay. Just be careful you don't end up naked and jacking it in San Diego. 

This tape makes people freak out wherever it goes.

I'm not arguing about The Passion! He's being an asshole!

Ziplining was your idea, you fatass!

How do we find somebody who can wrestle that well?

"Wanted by U.S. Border Patrol"?! "Permission to shoot on sight"?!

I know, but dude, we can't license our games to EA Sports and pay the crack babies nothing. Slavery is illegal.

They're cells that come from fetuses, and some research show that they could be used to treat diseases.

Dude, we've been working this case since two-thirty!

Dude, this is unbearable.

Hello. There are certain networks that we see as harmful to our families, and we want them removed, please.

Chef, the police are asking questions about you!

I actually hugged you. I held you in my arms and, and, cried with you.

Clyde got $3000 from his mom's life insurance

Well look, if being around lots of cash negatively affects the HIV, then maybe...

We're sorry, Butters.  Our mind is made up.

Yes!

What's the matter, Mr. Hankey? Are you sick?

Ugh... 

No I won't, because you'd eat 'em first, tubby. 

So can I go to the Magic Camp, to learn how to become a full member? All the other guys are doin' it, and it's only $69.95.

That is Craig. 

I know, but—why do they have to take it out on us? Why do we have to wait around for them to come back?

I wish that was good enough, but if you censor out Mohammad, then soon you'll have to censor out more.

Wow! He looks great!

Fine!

AAAARGH!

Me too. 

We're so sorry. Please forgive my little brother. He's going through puberty.

What's strike three?!

Not one adult left?

Oh no...

Nothing.

Well, ah I mean, we have to accept that we have a problem, and put the blame completely on ourselves. I mean, maybe this isn't really even a disease. 

You can't believe it?? He does this shit all the time!

...No, dude, it really isn't cool. You all turned your backs on me. You're supposed to be my best friends and you just... treated me like nothing! And now you all expect me to just forget it all and, and hang out with you again like nothing happened?

There is no such thing as a funny fuse, Cartman. You felt bad.

Kyle Broflovski.

Holy shit, dude!

Hello, help!

Killer!! 

Can I talk to you?! 

AAAAAAAAAAAAH!

Oh God!  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to-ah, I'm looking for my brother.  Ike??  What the hell is going on??

Yes, let's. 

We didn't do our homework.

Can we get going now, please?!

How many ball does that get us?

You swore on the cross, fatso!

Oh, God! 

Hmmm.

This place is rad. Look at all the trees and stuff.

Wuh, what's done?

Ike?  Oh crap Ike?

What manatees??!! 

No! You have to show Mohammad, Mr. President!

Nobody said anything about a post-season.

Hey guys. You wanna throw the football around?

Why are you being such a dick?

I don't know. It's old.

What?

Whoa. 

Sure we'll help! 

Dude, that's terrible!

Okay.

Yeah. You're acting like a freak, Wendy.

Our little man is growing up, Stan. He's growing up.

What?! I'm not talking to you! 

What's the Primary Main Objective?

Because without big corporations we wouldn't have things like cars and computers and canned soup.

Ah, I don't know, it just feels like... there's got to be something else going on here.

No, Timmy, wait!

If you want your share of the money, then you're gonna shovel snow like the rest of us!

Yeah.  And that means that McGyver is a real person too.

Fine. That's it. I give up. Have fun being miserable.

Look, dude, things around here have changed. Sometimes, the only way to keep going is to make a left turn.

Aww, that's some dude jacking off! 

The only reason we scored high was because we took the answers out of Garrison's desk! And you know it!

But, you guys, I--

Ha, Goddamnit!  Haaa. Ohhhh. Ahh, ohh, uhh, agh, 

Dude, I can't believe we are dealing with this Muhammad thing again.

To me??

Why do you put them into people's asses? Are you planning some kind of alien takeover?

Dude, you can't miss Halloween! You have your iPad?

That's not what I meant!

No!

Aah.

Where?!

-And I'll stand. 

Better, thanks.

Butters, can't you see this is wrong? You've got little boys all over school spending all their lunch money on kisses. Boys shouldn't be paying for kisses. It's wrong.

Ah I guess.

Guess what? You're not my best friend anymore! Cartman's my new best friend!

In a sewer?

Craig just called you a boner!

F-minus? Can he do that?

Why?

Can I come in?

Good point. 

Hang on, Blanket! 

We don't have time for this.

What?

That thing is pretty cool. What games did you get with it?

Ah man! I can't keep my eyes open. 

Sir? Sir, can we talk to you for just a second?

You hate this game too?

You bastards! 

It's not?

God damnit!

Yeah! g'uh... A, a documentary?

Ah-ah-ah-are wooden desks all that available? I usually prefer the plastic ones because these give me splinters.

Butters! Butters, is everything okay?

Don't you have any superpowers?

No, he'll die!

It's this place called Des Moines. It's like, lost in time, see?  Everybody looks like you do.  Fashion is two years behind, Technology is two years behind, fads, are two years behind, just like you. 

Aren't those the queermos on the Disney Channel?

I told you guys.

Alright, Butters. Let's see what you've got.

So can you do it?

I'm sorry, Kip, but I really can't be your friend anymore. It was a great ride, but I must say goodbye. This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do, but ending a friendship... is never easy. 

Yeah, fatass, this is their famous Mechanic sketch.

I don't really see the fun in...  ...not trying to kick that game's ass once and for all!

No it isn't, it hurts! I can't believe they let us play this in school.

What? Why?

I can't lose another friend. First Kenny and now Stan? All I'm gonna have left are you two douches. 

Dad, how could you?!

What should we do?

Cartman??

Don't let him touch you! You die if he touches you!

No problem, Funnybot.

Well keep looking.

Bad.

Hm, I think he took that pretty well, I think.

That guy's a pretty good wrestler.

But it's gotta be perfect. We're trending well, but we need to attract more followers who want good old family values.

I'll give you five bucks to eat your puke.

She's here!

Really sorry about all this, dude.  So what the heck are we gonna do now? Muhammad isn't safe here.

Dude, it's been twelve hours. Where the hell are our parents?!

...french fries...pizza...pizza...pizza-french fries... I wonder where our parents are.

Dude, my mom won't even let me have a hamster.

Aharmani Exchange?

I'm sorry, Stan. I'm sorry. This whole war has just got us all so screwed up. I just want us to be playing Call of Duty on the right machine.

These people aren't going to prove anything. To believe any of this you either have to be a liar, or stupid.

No, no, no.  We want to make little pot-bellied elephants that people can keep in their houses as pets.

Dude, why the hell would you DO that?!

So we've gotta find another way out of here.

It worked!

Look, we've just gotta get Chef alone. He won't listen to reason with that hooker around.

"Get ready", "answer the door", Jesus Christ, make up your friggin' mind! 

Well... what kind of stuff does she like? Do you know?

Yeah, maybe that just kind of what they do naturally.

Come on! 

If you really think every kid in America should see your anti-bullying movie, then why don't you put it on the Internet for free?!

Jesus Christ!

I got it! I got it! According to PayPal, the Russian guys are just hired mercenaries who had ads up on Craig's List and got paid through eBay so that Boston could be attacked by... the British.

Y-yeah, but… the color of someone's skin doesn't matter.

Well we got tickets to see Terrance and Phillip Live in Denver tomorrow night. We paid forty bucks apiece for them.

Jimmy, we're gonna have everyone write in a mascot that's really funny, and you have to tell us which one would be funnier.

Good thing we made those changes to the seating.

Wow! Cool!

Hey dudes.  What are those?

Wow, dude, check it out! We can win Terrance and Phillip dolls. 

Uh huh.

Haaah! 

What?

But it's our game. We bought it together.

Noo! No.  Noo! 

Yeah. We're very good friends. We're very good friends, Stan!

That's a great idea!

Well, it's 3:30; I don't see any god-damned underpants gnomes, Tweek.

Yeah, dude, your Uncle Jimbo sucks ass!

Dude, we can't do a presentation on underpants gnomes. Mr. Garrison will fail us because you're making it up.

I've been trying! But I just don't know how to make totally new friends on the Internet.

We're not letting you back in the band, Cartman! Fuck off!

Girls like shaved balls?

Oh Christ...

You assholes stole our client! How about some Goddamn business ethics?!

Don't do it, kid. 

But it's not fair! We have to do a full report on the Founding Fathers, and Cartman got out of helping us again!

Well, because, we don't really... believe in Jesus.

Hang on.  Hold on a second.  I gues... I... guess... this is... goodbye, Willzy-x.  I'm gonna miss you.  Hey, don't forget me, okay? I won't forget you. 

Dammit Cartman! I gave it to you so you would shut... up.

Scott Tenorman?

Dude, did you get your period yet?

What did you say?

You're a fat skank, Mom. 

Awwgh!

No way! There's no real connection between us. It was all a big lie.

Please. Please let him go.

No ending? Well, we can't animate until we have our voices recorded, so we'd better just record what we have and figure out the ending later. 

I told you not to call my mom a bitch, Cartman!

"The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few?" That was Wrath of Khan.

Be a good boy? You know all about this?

Yah.

Yeah! Then she told us to throw a chair at Ned!

Dude... What?

Yeah. Hey Stan, what did your dad mean when he said we're gonna play Truth or Dare?

Protect it?

Dude, what the hell's wrong with you?!

Phew.

A lot, I think.

I don't know you, dude.

Dude, this whole building is going to collapse!

But you didn't do anything to me.

Dude, why do you care?!

Okay, good. You're all here.

Hey! Look at that line!  It's way shorter.

It kind of looks like... an egg.

Good! 

Mr. Hankey! Sshhhh! I'll get in trouble.

Here we go again.

Wow! Three months without parents!

But where have you been? Things aren't the same without you. Nobody seems to have the Christmas spirit.

I don't know. We just have to get it to town and let them figure out what to do with it.

That's right!

...Nothing.

Somebody do something!

Thanks dude! 

See ya.

An online chat party for all his friends... Dude, I should get over there!

Mom, Dad, can I go with the guys to see the Raging Pussies?

Wha-? Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You Bastards!

We can't be outdone by the kindergartners!

Yeah, this all happened the day after he went to that concert!

Your grandma left it to you! You didn't earn it!

Please, you guys, you don't understand.  My family is devastated. My mom just walks around the house like a zombie, and my dad can't stop crying.

Hey, that's a great idea!

Indy deserved more than that!

Mr. Hankey, no!

Why did you go and have to be abducted, Tweek? Now all our parents are freaking out!

What?  You mean the missile defense program?!  Butters, where's Cartman supposed to hand over the ballots?!

with dreidel I shall play.

Oh. Well, I certainly don't want you to feel that "Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly on the Table" is holding you back. 

How do we make three hundred thousand dollars doing that?

No asshole! From now on you only get to have one power! So what is it?!

I'm a Jew
A lonely Jew...

Cartman! I will not stand by and let you cheat your way to winning the Special Olympics!

Then I guess... I'm a dumbass. 

What? Are you crazy?

Dude, what are you doing?

We need help! Our friend is in a coma!

Just get to it already!

God-damnit! 

...I can't even get her to understand. It's like she's from another planet.

Cartman, what did you do?!

You live on the Eastside, Cartman!

He probably thinks if he apologizes to everyone, we'll think he's changed and let him back into our circle.

Don't worry. I know what to do.

We can't miss the final apocalyptic battle between Good and Evil!

You're lying!

Thanks, Mrs. Marsh.

Well? Are you happy, Cartman? Butters is completely traumatized!

Sir, we're doing everything we can.

You probably should come clean and tell the truth. Did you superglue your bracelet?

Yeah. Quick!

Wow! 

That's what you care about?! Who's the poorest kid in school now?!

Well come on! 

Look, the truth is, we all have a bigger problem now, and you know it. Nobody is going to get anything if we don't work together against those thousands of other shoppers.

Dude, he must be loaded! What does he do?

Well!  You're gonna be sorry when you see me riding around on Santa's sleigh with Mr. Hankey, fatass!

It's the evil pets 

I do not sound like Cartman goddamnit!  Okay, so, see ya. 

Yeah well, I can't really afford to play anymore anyway. I'm about out of quarters.

Dude! We're not digging up my grandma; I'll get in trouble.

Excuse me. Eric Cartman has HIV?

Great. 

No more. No more. Oh, come on, Cartman, no. No more. 

...Maybe. 

Hey, Stan. Do you know how to play Truth or Dare?

We need everyone's help here. What you're looking for are big boxes of ballots. Hundreds of them. Please check your basement, your attic, and-

Here.  Just look more closely at it.

Can we please go faster?!

Oh my God, they killed Kenny. You Bastard!!!

Yummy yummy yummy I want Cartman's farts in my tummy.

Cartman!! Wake up you fat piece of crap!! 

That's right!

Stan! Stan, what the hell is going on?!

Principal Victoria, there's something you need to know! Cartman's Tourette's isn't real! He's faking!

Gay-ass. 

Dammit! This is never gonna work.

Ungh, I can't find the word "queef" anywhere! 

A U-Haul. What if we bring Muhammad to South Park in the back of a U-Haul, and he just stays in there out of sight?

You threw it away, fatso!

Are you old Frida?

Well, it, it looks like...

Oh my God!

Come on, Muhammad, the door is open.

Hello?

Hey Stan.

Yeah.

You've never watched the news, fatass!  And what the hell does that have to do with anything?!

Wow! These are huge!

Yeah. We've been playing with firecrackers our whole lives.

Dammit!  Ike, if you wanna keep your penis, you have to get on this train.  Ready, Ike? Kick the baby!

Phillip, your partner.

I didn't suck his balls, all right?! And I'm not going to!

Huh? I thought you wanted to leave.

But, but we, we learned things, and took up a cause.

Okay okay... I love having Cartman's farts in my tummy. I love it.  I love it sooo sooo much.

We d-didn't think it was that big a deal.

Dude, it's Scuzzlebutt! Cartman wasn't lying.

Whoa. Check it out, dude.  It's got little drawings on it.

I...

Shut up, fat boy!

Here you go!  Here you go! 

Do you hear that, Stan? It worked! We've shut down the veal industry!  Stan? Stan?? 

Well, we can still pre-tend like we know what it means.

Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,

What?! You said we had plenty of money, Cartman!

Yeah, stupid!

Well if I'm going down, Cartman's going down!

Alright, this is gonna sting for a second. 

Do you?! Do you, Stan?! Because all my life I was raised to believe in Jehovah! To believe that we should all behave a certain way and good things will come to us. I make mistakes, but every week I try to better myself. I'm always saying, "You know, I learned something today..." and what does this so-called God give me in return? A hemorrhoid. He doesn't make sense!  What is your logic?!  Ow. 

A hundred thousand dollars?

(Sick!)

I'm going to try and break you away from the computer, Cartman. I need to remove the CPU.

How are we supposed to name our startup company if every name is already taken?!

No!  No, it isn't true!

What?!

Hay! He's totally underage. She's taking advantage of him.

What are you talking about?!

That's nothing compared to what my mom will do to me if she finds out I've been lying for five years!

Take a look. 

You'll never get a platinum album doing Christian rock, Cartman! It was a stupid idea then, and it's a stupid idea now!

Bu- but I got these tickets to see Lion King on stage.

Stan, are you alright?

Oh, Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,

So?

Really? What about?

Don't try to take me away again, Mom and Dad! I told you! I renounced the Jewish faith!

He's lying.

Yeah.

Mom, Ike did it again. I don't know what's going on with him, but, it's like he hates me.

I- I can't do it... I can't do it. I...

Oh my God, they killed Kenny! YOU BASTARDS!

Let's just give it a chance, Ike.

Sure you do!

What's the matter with him?

Mom, Dad, what exactly are this party for?

Mr. Jefferson said we can invite all the kids in town to go play over at their house.

...Idiot.

No! 

No it wasn't, fatass! I saw you do it!

Please stop!

What the hell are you doing?!

You what?

Awwww!

Ike, that is enough! If you're interested in Call of Duty, go play it downstairs in the living room!

Huh??

It always has been. See? This is nice. 

Will you knock it off already?!

This is gonna be awesome!

Moving in?!

Well, what's the point? Jimmy always wins with his stand-up comedy.

Well, go on, smartass, and do it!

What?

This was supposed to be my story! My coming to terms with a guilty conscience! This isn't fair!

No!  I am NOT letting you go to that television studio and pretend... to care about safety and sensitivity to get a show you don't like off the air!

Come on dude, we have to get to practice.

Alright, then. 

Wait, what are you taking Stan's blood for?

Well, that whole experience sure did suck.

I can't believe they would put a fake Mr. Hankey in a mall! If Mr. Hankey ever found out, he'd be so pissed!

TP her house?

Yeah. This is like the third day in a row. I wonder what's wrong

Sister, you don't know the half of it.

Whoa, dude! She doesn't have any arms!

Excuse me, what are you doing to my locker?!

with dreidel I shall play.

The history of Easter.

I mean, what if I'm just part of my parents' reality?

I don't know.

...Become a Peruvian flute band?

In our deal with EA Sports we are giving them the right to use images of the crack babies and their names. But we aren't paying the crack babies.

Is, is this? Do you think this is cool?

Just come on! It's getting dark.

Move on?! Our friend was raped, Stan! He was raped, and we all stood there and did  nothing!

But it's... it's not true they... have no souls. 

Yeah! What the hell were we thinking?! Boooooo!

Yeah. He was doing their voices and pouring tea for them.

Because, if we go to the tobacco company, I know exactly what'll happen. They'll take us in, and then Rob Reiner will show up with all the townspeople, holding torches or something, and there'll be a big showdown until we talk about what we learned, and change everyone's minds - this is all following a formula!

Ha! You see?!

Go, Tweek. Kick his ass! Get him!

...Okay, fine! Here!  Now let's go!

Hey Stan, now that Terrance & Phillip has been taken off the air, what are we going to do for entertainment?

Heidi Turner said you asked her to borrow superglue last week.

Wait. No wait a minute! I've got it. I've totally got it!

Lots of people will when I tell them!

We'd better get out of here. 

Rainbows are those little arches of color that show up during a rainstorm.

You bastard!

You know, could youuu...

Good job, dude! You freaked him out!

Okay. First one to die, loses.

Yeah. Come on, Dad, this place sucks. I wanna go.

It is?

Cartman, you only come to soccer practice on Fridays, and that's only because we have Kentucky Fried Chicken afterwards!

Yes we do! We have a sweet name.  I was wrong, Cartman. "Washington Redskins" is the perfect name. I think maybe I was jealous that I didn't come up with it.

We did it!

Whoa whoa, I'm not going anywhere.

Wait. Wait. I think I can explain this whole thing. Marklar, these marklars want to change your marklar. They don't want Marklar or any of these marklars to live here because it's bad for their marklar. They use Marklar to try and force marklars to believe they're marklar. If you let them stay here, they will build marklars and marklars. They will take all your marklars and replace them with Marklar. These marklar have no good marklar to live on Marklar, so they must come here to Marklar. Please, let these marklars stay where they can grow and prosper without any marklars, marklars, eh or marklars.

Why?

Impress Wendy??

Yeah. Clearly Annie Nelson is the hottest girl at our school. Look at those eyes!

Hello?? I've been saying this for years!

Oh crap. 

Chef, you've gotta help us!

This is amazing! But wait right here. I've gotta go tell my friends about this! 

Hey, what about that stupid panda?

What are you talking about, Stan?

Yeah! Next time you make up a word, don't make up one that already exists!

No- Dude, Gorak is cool because it's original. And besides, you found him.

It's no use. There's nobody around for miles.

A tattle-tale?! He infected me with AIDS!

Nah, my mom packed me a kosher lunch.

Terrorists?

Let go of the tape, Butters!

I said I wanna leave.

I just want a nurection so I can give it to my mom.

Boy, that really did the trick, Stan. I thought we were kind of, sort of, not really done for.

Why is Death coming after us?

Why do you always have to hit stuff with a stick?!

Hold it!  Principal Victoria, Mr. Mackey, Mrs. Streible. We have something we need to tell you.

How does that make the world better?

Ow! 

If you didn't eat so much, you wouldn't have diarrhea all the time, fatass!

It's Kenny's singing!

Thee... uhhh. What if the-?

I... because the world is at peace. I must endure.

Yeah. 

Hey dudes.

Why are you doing this, Stan?

Where the hell are they coming from?! 

Yeah, fatass, it has to be real to be scary!

No, but look: I just got this sweet Cyborg Bill doll.

I didn't come here to talk about The Passion, Cartman!

Butters? What the hell are you doing?

Okay ma, thanks! 

Cartman, knock it off!

Face it Stan! Nobody's coming for us! 

Damn it!

There's nothing here! 

That's because there is no goo, Mr. Cruise. You see, I learned something today. Throughout this whole ordeal, we've all wanted to show things that we weren't allowed to show. But it wasn't because of some magic goo. It was because of the magical power of threatening people with violence. That's obviously the only true power. If there's anything we've all learned, it's that terrorizing people works.

Alright, so did everyone settle on their wrestling names?

No! Ah!

I did it! Now I can go to the Raging Pussies!

Nooo! 

This is when you gotta get mean, Tweek.

Mighty powerful network executives,

I know. I'm almost at the end and there's nothing. 

Hmmm, yeah.

Ahall right!

We didn't say nothin' about no kids, man!

Patrick Duffy? Damn it Cartman, that's not scary!

...You're a stupid asshole! 

Maybe I'll start my own company.

Stan!

Excuse us, we're trying to get a picture of Britney Spears!

Yeah. And the leader, he said that all the Ethiopians can go live there. 

All right, you see, Clyde. Okay, we wanna help him sue whoever invented the toilet.

Who are you?

Candy bars?

But David Blaine is gonna do more miracles in Denver tomorrow..

Go away, Mr. Hankey.

Hehaha, heh.

IT WASN'T MY IDEA, IT WAS YOURS! YOU KILLED KENNY, YOU BASTARD!

Because! Everyone is suing everyone else, and you're pretty much the cause of it all!

Twenty... million?  Are you nuts? We don't have that kind of money.

An ailnay ilefay.

It matters, dude. 

You guuuys!

Middle-earth is again safe.

We gave you guys herpes.

...a-are starting to take offense at your actions. We feel like you're starting to become-hmm... 

It's stupid.

Hey. Maybe it's that thing, Scuzzlebutt. 

Oho, we will. Trust us. We won't miss this. 

Washington Redskins?

Dude, an awards show just for comedy sounds like a bad idea.

Abraham Lincoln has been dead for two hundred years!

Oh, yeah. Yeh-yeah. It's a-it's not even noticeable. 

Craig, we have chosen you to join our Peruvian flute band!

Oh shut up Cartman! You don't even know what you're talking about!

The TV left.

No no, he's right! We've gotta make it for someone in need so that people have to go.

I want some!

What was it about? Ih-in case our teacher asks us.

I know, hunh? Put your mouth against the glass like this.  Waaaaah! 

But it's okay, Stan, because I finally figured it out. You see, if someone like Cartman can get a million dollars and his own theme park, then there is no God. There's no God, dude.

So, just to be completely clear, now it isn't funny, right?

Well, he has this new teacher's assistant, and uh and they're both... totally gay.

Oh, man. I can't just sit here, I have to help my stupid brother, or I'll come home without him and my dad will start yelling, "Where's your brother, Kyle?" "You weren't looking out for your little brother, Kyle?"

So you never met your mom?

We can't tell our parents, dude! We lied to everybody! Nobody knows we're responsible for Ms. Claridge's accident!

Oh no! Dad's metrosexual too?

I still say this is a bad idea.

We have a dead friend.

Oh God!

Sometimes I think I can see time slowing down,  and my own existence fading.

Yup, he's in here. 

Okay. We won't tell anybody as long as you are super nice to us, every day, from now on.

Man, I would have loved to seen to seen the look on Trent Boyett's face when all the sixth graders showed up!

Nono, after we found Cartman, I put the headset on and then-

Hey!  Dude. You're alive?  Come back here! 

Oh. Really? Um well that's okay.

Cartman released the PS4s Cartman. They're being reviewed. People are liking them.

You know what, Cartman? I believe you.

Camp?

Wait! Wait a minute.  What about a logic loop?

Aaaah!

We-ull, some fish would be great if it isn't too much trouble.

Yeah, what a dick!

Listen, this is all you need to know: the economy is not a supernatural all-knowing entity. The economy is just an idea, made up by people, thousands of years ago. The economy is not real. And yet, it is real. Nowadays they'll give credit to practically anyone who applies for them.  I applied for this yesterday to prove a point. It is an American Express Platinum card.  It has no spending limit.  Do not be afraid! This is only plastic. It's just something made up by people. Truly meaningless until we put our faith in it. Faith is what makes an economy exist. Without faith, it is only plastic cards and paper money.

But everybody watches Terrance & Phillip.

You've had that cough a while, Kenny. You okay?

You bastards! Come back here! Coomme baack!  Damn it, we were so close!

It seems like I might get splinters, though.

Chef, this place isn't you!

Maybe we should get out first. See if we can find a way out and then come back for him.

Can you see anything? 

Look, however hard you think it for you, it's a lot harder for him!

Go ahead. 

That wasn't the Mayan apocalypse, you racist idiot!

What was that? 

But instead, we should all be treated the same, with the same laws and the same punishments for the same crimes . For in that way Cartman can be freed from prison, and we  will have a chance to win the sledding race on Thursday.

What part of being infected with a deadly disease do you find funny?!

Hey. Wuh I'm giving a speech tomorrow about people with red hair and freckles. Can I ask you a few questions?

The Declaration of Independence?

Dude, we've arrived. We're super, awesome, and cool.

Dad, if the school has to pay you and Cartman $1.3 million, where does that money come from?

I think Clyde is kind of cool, but Craig is definitely cooler than Clyde.

Dude, we've gotta hurry home! The final episode of Lost is on soon. 

Imagina-eh

Dude. Are you sure that fish is a murderer? It seemed like a normal fish to me.

Weird

Huh?

But Dad, this is all the never-before-seen footage.

You got your what?

I'm confused. Did Ally Sheedy take that personality test?

Dude, what's wrong with him?

You don't wash your hands after going to the bathroom!

Are you gonna take us somewhere or not?!

What did they say??

Yeah!

What's it say?

You're in a forest! Go take a crap!

It's a least a couple of hours.

Kenny, how many of my dad's mints are you gonna eat? Jesus!

That is not what happened! You totally started crying and quit the game!

I'm making a dummy Ike doll. My parents think he's out with me right now, and I have to bring him back for dinner.

So you blamed the government?!

Oh. Hey, that's not very nice, Mayor. Just because a person is gay doesn't mean he's a fag.

Yeah, dude. It looks riveting. 

Hey man. You okay?

Wow!

Cartman! Wait!

Fuck you if you're in on this.

I told you, Cartman.

A smart one, that can do tricks.

Look, it's almost time.

Aaaggh, God.

Butters! He got a ninja star stuck in his eye, and we were taking him to the vet when you fucked it all up! Butters!

Stan, what is going on?!

We came for our reward.

Mom, Dad!  They're gonna kill her! They're going to in-. Wait, what are you doing here?

Stan, there was never anything between Wendy and I.  I wouldn't go out with my best friend's ex-girlfriend.

Shut up, fatass!

Dude, asshole, you're keeping a lot of other celebrities in purgatory!

God dammit! 

What are you talking about, fatass?

What is Native American comedy, anyway?

We're singing about a dreidel.

Oh, thanks.  Dude, that new girl's into me!

Noo! No.  Noo! 

Then we should go to the record company. My dad's a lawyer, dude; he tells me about this stuff all the time.

...That is so missing the point.

Well Stan, you want to know what I think?

Alright, Cartman. I'm gonna give you... a jail-time card.  You lose a turn.

What's a VHS? 

Because it was-

Okay, I fed the pigs. Now I definitely should water some fields... Oh wow, cool. That Jewish kid put up a sign on my farm. "Hey Kyle, really like your farm." Oh awesome!  What the hell is that? Stan? 

I can't wait to get out of school and get our Teiko sports watch.

Mr. Hankey.  He comes out of the toilet every year and gives presents to everybody who has a lot of fiber in their diet.

No, dude. That's a branch.

Right. But in the 1340s people in England stopped calling it "skite" and started calling it "shit." The same year as the Black Plague.

That's amazing.

Oh please! All you ever do is call me names and rip on me for being Jewish!

Butters was supposed to go with us to Casa Bonita tonight.

What?

You know I can't go there, Stan!

Cartman!

But I thought we were supposed to care on Thanksgiving.

Hogh, my stomach hurts.

...Yeah, and dressing up and running around at night is faggy anyway.

You don't pee in the shower, dude, that's fucking disgusting!

Aaaaah! Gross! 

All Wall-Marts start a self-destruction sequence if you break a mirror in the back.

Yeah, and then Chef pulled up in his car. 

Here he comes.

What is this, Cartman?

He's right. We should do a merger.

All right I've had enough! Leprechauns are imaginary!

What happened to you?

What? This isn't history.

What's that?

WE'RE NOT BEING GRANDPAS!

Whoa! What's wrong with your head?! Why are you shaking like that?

Don't worry. Everything's gonna work out. It always does.

You want a fight? Well, that's fine with me!

It's not me! I'm here to help you, fatass!

I believe that you're a broke, ignorant idiot!

Ungh, gay, dude.

Well, Tweek's okay, but he's certainly no Kenny! 

Oh wait. Cartman.

What happened? I thought you were gonna kill yourself.

God damn it! I don't want him to jump over more a-

with dreidel I shall play.

It says you gotta check it for holes or tears.

Ike, you need to have a life. Have fun. Then ruin it by having a serious relationship. 

Alright Cartman, I've been doin' a lot of thinking about how the company's gonna spend the money we make off the EA Sports deal. We're going to use thirty percent of the money to build an orphanage for the crack babies.

Huh?

Weh-well, why didn't you tell anybody?

Dude, I don't wanna play Detective anymore.

You bastards! 

Listen to me: the little boy who convinced you to pull the episode is a bastard child. He only wants you to pull it because he knows it will be the end of Family Guy forever!

Really?! What's there not to understand?!

Cartman, what the hell are you doing?

You don't understand! Willzy-x is from the moon! He'll die if we don't get him back, now! Willzy-x, you have to talk! Come on boy, you have to! I know you're sick, but you could do it!

Hoh no, dude. If they get sent back to Romania, we'll never get our Cirque dei Ceville going.

Hold on. I'll be right back. 

Stan? 

Can someone help us? My little brother fell out of a window. 

Mr. Adler?

Magic Johnson?

Oh dude! Dude, this is the part I was talking about. Check out the bassline on this! 

What?!

This is our shot at making it into the WWE. To be real wrestlers. 

No we didn't, dude! No we didn't! 

So, how are things going at Cartman's theme park?!

All right, look, th-that isn't mine. I'm just holding it for a friend.

We need some help identifying an ancient English stone.

But it's the truth!

Aren't you hungry Kenny? 

Sick, dude!

And where is your mom?

I happen to be the one person who's putting everyone else's needs before their own!

Wow! Those are some pissed off turkeys!

What the hell are you singing, Cartman?

Heheh, we could make you say whatever we wanted.

Why do people have to keep reminding us of what we don't have?!

Dude! Bebe is really smart!

...Dude...

Maybe she's in the lunch line.

Well, who really cares what that monster is outside? As long as we stay on the bus, it can't hurt us. Right? 

Ms. Ellen, dude! She's beautiful! 

What a dick!

But we actually are busy. Tonight's the big fight.

You made hamburgers? Well that's awesome! I'd love one.  Mmm. Hm, wow  This is really good, Cartman.

We're good, Scott. Stop bugging us. 

It just keeps getting worse. I see stuff from Amazon almost every day. My poor dad has no idea.

It's... big.

You bastards!

He did take a ship.

Alright, Cartman! What's so important you had to pull us away from lighting cow crap on fire?!

My head still feels funny.

Ruuun! 

Did it work?

I'm actually the complete opposite.

Don't you remember? That time we were out hunting with your uncle Jimbo and Ned.

But dad, he always sh...

Mom! Dad! I have awesome news! The doctor who gave Mr. Garrison his sex change said he can make me tall and black. 

Waitwaitwait, Jimmy told you about this game?

I know, but he posted a message of me with a schlong on my head.

What am I, Mom?

I don't know, but at least from now on, every time we look at the moon, we can know that Willzy-x is up there, dancing with the other zypods in his castle.

Yeah. Just when he was being accepted he has to leave and start over.

Oh no, I d- I don't want to be a bother, I uh-

We got Cartman's pig so we can splice its genes with my elephant's.

I'm a Paladin, Cartman!

I hate picture day at school! It's always some gay-ass photographer with some gay-ass backdrop of New England!

But... isn't that, kind of, lying?

Hey Stan. Dude, I want you to have this. It's the twenty bucks I owed you plus thirty dollars interest.

Gone are the dark clouds that had me-

But right now I'd say if we're gonna have a retard for a friend, I, I have to pick Timmy. Because Timmy doesn't tell any jokes.

What?

I got it! I got the ball. 

I caught it! I caught it!

Awesome! We get powers?

What "agreement"?!

How do you know that?

Yeah, that's why we wanna have a startup company.

This is where we all stand in a circle and pray to Moses for guidance during Jewbilee.

I'll kick you in the nuts, Stan! 

Butters is staying over tonight?

YES, dude! 

What do you want?!

Why would he do this?!

Uh, Timmy, if we back to the other kids with that turkey they're gonna be pissed!

Dad, where do leprechauns come from?

Yeah.

No!  AAAAH!  AAAAH! 

Kick ass, dude! Cartman's mom throws the best birthday parties ever.

Oh, this is so cool.

How about fifty daura?

Dude, boars are only worth two experience points apiece. Do you know how many we would have to kill to get up 30 levels?

Damnit, I have to have those dolls! 

Dude, we're totally fucked now!

You forgot to wear a costume Kenny.

Dude. You have sex with children.

I think Kenny likes it. 

Not because of the Jews, Butters! Who told you that?

You bastards!

Thanks, Mick! 

Cartman!

Maybe we should go for it.

Hunh. That was pretty weird.

Come out here and talk to me face to face! Open this door!

Four white birds!

Marvin... 

Alright, we made it!

No! 

Come on, Kenny. You have to get in the circle.

Oh! Hey, Kenny.

What?!

Serves you right, Cartman!

Dude, thanks for helping us out by joining our team.

No! Cartman, that was just a dream!

What's this about you going on live television on Saturday?!

I still feel bad, Cartman

You're Stan? Where's Kenny?

Yep.

Butters! When did you call Oculus Rift Customer Service?!

What's the point?

Well you should. The poor guy shouldn't be screamed for something that just isn't that big a deal at all. 

Okay. But you've gotta promise to not complain.

You don't need that! Get off of it.

Who took all the pizza and the cake?  What the hell?

We've got to do something.

Happy Easter, Jesus. 

Because you're a fucking fatass, that's why!

But you know, I've learned something today. I've learned that people who want power, a lot of power, always... end up dead.

That's horrible. If that's true, I don't wanna see it.

Wow, cartoons are getting really dirty!

Yeah they're the best!

Come on Kenny.

Yeah, they abduct people and they mutilate cows.

Yes, ah I'm trying to locate my parents. M-my name is Kyle Broflovski. Yes, I know Obama won.

You don't have any powers!

If you do not accept treatment I will no longer give you money or be your friend. I will not help you kill yourself.

Yes. I'm saying one-fourth of Americans are retards.

I endure what I must for the sake of all humanity.

Casting...there's an 8-second cast time.

Dude, we don't have time for your stupid jokes! We're gonna die!

I'm showing her.

Well just hurry, Butters. You can probably make it back in time before the first commercial break.

Oh my God... Oh my God...

Well... if you put it that way...

Hey Kenny.

Cartman, we can't do this alone. You have to get up.

Let's do it Wing!

What did he do?

Yeah dude! We are the Avengers!

I'll die if I do swim in it!

That's better.

No, we're gonna get creamed!

Wow. There must be at least 20 people out there. 

Why don't they leave those movies alone? We liked them the way they were!

No, no, you... you wrote down Turd Sandwich.

When a man and a woman feel ...love... they put their lips together.

You guys! You guys! I have awesome news!

How?

NO!

Hey, we should start our own Cirque du Cheville.

Thanks, Mick.

What do you mean? We thought she was with you.

Don't worry, guys. I'm getting a nurection as we speak.

You sonofabitch, Cartman!  You don't fart when you're locked in a small space with other people! 

I know! It's so much worse than Catcher in the retarded Rye!

Dumbass, if there's sixty percent of them to forty percent of us, then who's the minority?!

Kenny wasn't lying.

No, it isn't!

Because I m-I mean I really think you could have done it for about $12.50.

Oh my God!

If she holds his hand in that theater it'll be all over.

But you were just gonna take it out in the backyard and put a bullet in its head!

You ba--! 

What the hell?  Ike?

I don't know. I feel like I should confront my mom first. But it's so embarrassing.

From now on, MOOP isn't about money. MOOP is about music! We're not striking anymore! Who's with us?! 

No.

Hey! Heeey!

Cartman?  He's not gonna open it. Break it down.

Holy shit, dude! 

Who's Rob Reiner?

Hey dudes. 

This part kinda sucks, Kenny, but don't screw it up. 

Me too.

There he is! Now, don't let him know we think he's a loser, or else he won't play. 

You're on, fat boy!

Well, there you go, fatass! I hope you learned your lesson.

Cartman, what's happened?

Sure, outlander. I'll get it 

Oh, come on!!

All right McNuggets!  Did we pick the right rooster or what?!

Yeah, that'd be faster.

...Kenny, will you tell Cartman to shut up?

That's it Cartman, I'm outta here!  Chatroulette is no way for me to find new friends! 

Cartman?

My... family doesn't celebrate Christmas.

We've got work to do Stan, I think it takes a while for an elephant to get drunk.

I don't like big corporations.

Blow it out your ass, Cartman! 

Why are they doing us one at a time?

I didn't see he wouldn't be there, either. Look, all we have to do is get them there, right? Once Terrance and Phillip get together again, it'll be like old times.

How did your date with Ms. Ellen go?

We've had just about enough, dude! You've been blowing us off for two weeks now! What's up?!

Bad.

He was out all alone in the middle of the night. Mr. Jefferson isn't even home.

He's right. We have to take a hard stance right now and establish that we're the dominant ones in this relationship! 

Wait! You guys!  He's alive!  

Kenny was never gonna get his singing right anyway.

Ha! You lose, fatass!

Come on, this is serious!

We know how to fart, Mr. Mackey!

No you didn't, asshole! What you did was totally stupid and racist! And you only did it to screw me over!

What the hell are you doing?!

This is sweet, being rugged outdoorsmen.  Facing the wilderness, not having to be home until 8:30,... 

Wait a minute, Dad was the UPS man?

Stan! You've got to help us become good Christians. Please.

You should know, fatass.

Oh, so the gallant knight now comes to rescue me from the bowels of mediocrity! Oh, thank you, your royal lordship! 

What?

Well, looks like everything turned out alright for them.

Hoh hoh hoh!

It's so awesome, dude. Our company already has a hundred backers. And we still have 14 days to go!

Well?

Ms. Choksondik stinks inside. 

Huh?

Dude, this is great! You know all the Stations of the Cross, right, Stan?

Well, I'm sure glad this is all over with. Let's go count our candy.

There's no sand in my vagina!!!

About what?!

That bull sucks! He's not even bucking or anything!

He said they come on urgent business.

Hi, Mom!

Ask Jeeves? Nobody uses Ask Jeeves! Just Google-search it!

I don't have a problem.

Come on. Let's go see how Cartman is doing with his uh, urection.

...We actually spoke—to the Brian Boitano.

Because then you can pay us to use our friend in commercials.

Mr. Mackey, can I talk to you?

No, it's still just some whiny, annoying teenager talking about how lame he is.

Dammit!

Sorry, sorry. You know how after we spent the night at Kenny's house and-and you and Cartman got sick with chickenpox?

Will you stop with the underpants gnomes, Tweek?! We have to work here!  

Yeah. I guess that's the point. I don't think we're gonna understand. Maybe this IS all the beginning of a new art form. YouTube celebrities are only getting bigger. And what's great is that these people are inventing themselves, instead of being marketed and shoved down our throats.

Jimmy.

My parents said I can't go.

Did what?

But, wait. Where's the other team? 

What, Cartman?

They'd better be done with the book reports! School starts in 15 minutes!

Get outside! 

Alright guys, do you think he's lying or telling the truth?

All right, but it's gonna take more than one good player to beat the champions, Stan. You'd better have a really good game plan.

Yeah.  Hey Riley! Try this hamburger.  Cartman made them himself.

Agh!  Agghh! 

...Excuse me, I have to step out for a minute. 

So how was that movie last night, dude?

Where's the heart?

What are you guys doin'?

It wouldn't work!

Oh dude, check it out. I got a Jake Plummer.

Just let it go, dude. You only had sixteen dollars and twelve cents. Count all your losses and move on. He's smarter than you.

Go look! It's all an ancient Incan prophecy.

...You got Raging Pussies tickets??

Well! I hope it lived up to all the hype! You must feel so much better now!

Calm down, Cartman.

Awesome. 

Oh that's,  yeah that's good, that's good. Alright, chapter... one...

Car... Cartman! You've gotta swim! Kick with your legs!

Yeah.

What do you mean, "there's no tooth fairy?"

Better how, dude?

Okay, turn it on.

Please? I need you to come sit down for a second.  So... Here we all are. Mom, do you want to tell Dad something?  Mom?

Dude, I think you're being followed. 

So how do we get to Ottawa?

We told you they were real Cartman. Sorry to hear about your ass.

Dad, can we go home, please?

Wwait, what?

Sure you do!

Stan, you can use family love as a weapon against Shelly.  The next time she's gonna kick your ass, just tell her, "Shelly, you're my sister, and I love you."

Two Towers Video Store. I-in Conifer.

Dude! He got Brent Musberger for a leg!

What the hell are you doing?

Hoh God, here we go.

I'm sorry. I'm. I'm really. Cartman, I f-I feel really bad for you. Honestly.

Because, dumbass, we can dare them to do gross stuff and make them cry! What? Were you born yesterday?

Get the bull in the balls with a snowball.

Tweek. Now there's an interesting choice. Tweek has a lot of qualities that I look for in a friend.

No. I'm Jewish.

I got it! 

Since when you care about being sensitive to people's religion, Cartman?!

You... bastards...

...Oh, and I hope one day to be an investment banker.

You bastard!

...Not anymore you're not.

Seriously.

It's not too late to do what's right. Give us the print. There's still some good in you, Mr. Lucas. We know there is. 

We have to confess that we were the ones that-

Don't worry. We'll do this quick, okay? Just hang on, Mr. Hankey, just hang on!

We're so proud of you kids!

Aw, how the hell should I know?

Are you insane?!

Huh?

Wow. I feel so rejected.

That sounds great!

Oh my God.

Oh no! They ruined my life! I get to kill them first!

What??

No! Up yours, fatboy!

Uh-uh-uh what do you mean "they've taken it"? Oh, this isn't happening! This isn't happening!!

Hoh! Hoh hoh hoh hoh! 

So, what do you want to do now?

That's fine. 

What's all that stuff?

Well, I guess let's just be thankful we're not Butters. They won't even let him come back to school.

I don't care!

Upstairs! First door to the left!

Well, we thought you went exploring and like, hunting and stuff!

Doctor, this is Muhammad. We want you to clone him, so we can give his copies to gingers, and Barbra Streisand.

Kill it, Stanley. Kill it.  Come on Stan, kill it.

It's funny that something that should be completely private is put up on a Web site for everyone to see??

What dude? 

Dreidel dreidel dreidel-

Why, Mr. Farkle?

Whoa, I don't think anyone's been in here for centuries

Guys, we need to talk to you. I really don't think we wanna be a company that ISIS looks up to. We should maybe issue a statement saying that we don't sanction them.

But before he could go through with this entire plan, he discovered that the pie had already been eaten...  ...by your dog. 

There is a crisis in America! As families grow further and further apart-

Hey. Do you ever think maybe you shouldn't give your son coffee?

We understand you just sounded like a freakin' racist!

He purposely infected me with his HIV virus!

A woman pooping out her boobs is not good imagery!

Hello?

What's this all about, Cartman?

They're gonna take The Lord of the Rings from us.

They did it to us again! That dirty talent agency stole our client again!

He probably just ditched to avoid that spelling test.

I made you out of clay.

Just tell us, Butters.

You guys, that's not cool. These people have nowhere to go.  They don't have food or shelter. We have to do something.

We found it, you guys!  Oh no, they followed us! 

Huh, Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastard! 

Yeah, this is starting to look like something we shouldn't be any part of. Let's go play with trucks or something. 

Guys, guys, I know we're all concerned, but we have to work together!

It's all just in your head, Ike.

The-that's not the right way to look at it, I-

Who is Cupid Me?!

Well, I- guess we'll see you in school tomorrow, Chef.

Alright, alright! Knock it off! Stop spreading lies.

Surprise, fatass!

Okay. Today's word is "spirituality." What that means to me is uh- 

You guys! You guys! I've looked up the word, "shit"! I think it might have something to do with people dying!

You BAStard! You BAStard, Stan! 

Der, Cartman!

Stan, I told you. My mom doesn't want Ike playing hockey. She thinks it's dangerous.

We're missing out on some quality video game time right now.

Dude! Did you really lose all that weight eating nothing but sub sandwiches?

Native Americans. 

Yeah, Jimmy's right. I know we can come up with way better ideas than Craig.

Why?

Wuh what doesn't follow?

Ooogh. Dude, the thing is, we're not the ones that made them crack babies. That's their moms' goddamned fault!

If we're playing outside he shows up completely wasted and, and screaming how the government is following 'im.

Neither do I. 

Dude, have you seen my parents? 

Dammit, Cartman, you are such a fat fuck!

Dude, that's messed up. 

Whoa, dude! It's the bookmobile driver!

Dude! 

Singing a Christmas song isn't gonna get you nice deductions, Cartman! Don't forget: it's because of you that Santa's sleigh got shot down!

But why? If they're hungry and poor, why don't we just always give them half of our food?

Oh. Well... yeah. I, I did.

Come down here, you stinking aliens!  Uh, uh...

Hey. We paid for the sea people too. How come they're not making statues of us? 

What?  CARTMAN! 

We should not be wasting time and money making sure Cartman's fat scooter can't be tipped over!

I don't know.  Oh, great. He's got that stupid beard on again.

Jesus Christ, dude!

Huh?

But we can put our money together with the money you made whoring yourself to all the women. How much did you make?

Corey Lanskin?

Another devastating loss for the Cows last night, Eric. They were ahead in the game until Kelly Anderson started crying because she missed her daddy, who's on a business trip in Thailand. Uh, Kelly was so upset she couldn't play, and the Cows had to forfeit.

Well Cartman, the South lost! That mean you're our slave for a month!

Well, do you also do other surgeries like that?

I know, you're not.

No you're not!  I read the brochure, Cartman! If you're under eighteen, you have to have a parent with you to sign up for the Special Olympics.

Cool! Maybe we can do that to Cartman's cat.

Well, this is what I believe in now, Stan. And if you can't respect that,... then I guess we're not best friends anymore. 

What?

Dude, I can't deal with Wall-Mart right now. My parents had me there for three hours last night. 

Dude, that's fucked up.

We have to talk to him!

No!

Hey guys, can we talk to you? 

Oh, dude, I feel so much better about being Jewish now that I see that Mel Gibson is just a big wacko douche. 

If we win, we can buy a new go-cart that actually runs.

Yeah dude, like, full-on. Ike saw everything. It totally makes sense now. My mom's been ordering all kinds of stuff from Amazon lately. Sometimes, sh-she doesn't even remember what she's ordered. She's probably been having sex with the UPS man for a long time.

You don't know what you're talking about, fatass!

No no. I mean, go with me.

Sure!
I have a little dreidel; I made it out of clay.
And when it's dry and ready, with dreidel I shall- everybody!

Well why not?!

Where's all the cool costumes and jumping off ropes and stuff?!

Dude, what happened to your knee?

Dow... 

So I guess this means we get to keep our weapons.

Aw, dude, check this out. 

Mass suicide?

Yeah dude. I'm sorry.

What the hell is everyone wearing on their heads?

Did not!

Aw dide, this is hopeless!

Okay. Okay, come on you guys. 

We can't deal with you saying "hella" anymore, Cartman! You're going to the other universe! 

Whoa.  Kenny, you in there?

Jimmy, are you sure?

You mean there's more to this?

I can't say "ookie mouth" and have Kenny spit down my throat at the same time. It's impossible. 

We're just gonna fly to California and break into George Lucas's house. What's stressful about that?

You can't keep it.

Who are you?

Let's just get this over with!

He said they're doing a Total Recall.

Hey. Me and Cartman and Kenny are going down to Happy Burger. Do you wanna come?

We don't know. They lost all contact with him.

Date-rape something. Yeah. Okay. I will. Okay, thanks, Mon.  I don't have to go outside!

I don't start, you start.

Whoa. 

NO. Dude, maybe you should see a doctor.

Look, we're sorry, you guys, but the balloon just went up in the air and the dude sang a song and we were suddenly there.

I DIDN'T THINK THERE WAS GOING TO BE A GOD-DAMNED LEPRECHAUN!!

Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,

Worse than this?

South Park.

You were totally, one hundred percent right.

AAAARRRRGGGGGGHHHHH!!!

Heuh, the commercials! 

Hey, you just got here, Chef!

I'm sorry, Ike. 

Yeah, what it is, Mrs. Marsh?

It's just a stupid pig.

Uh, what are "studzes"

She said it's fine, but that I still have to go to baseball practice tonight..

Better than being a fatass Texan!

Oh my God!

Shhh. Willzy-x, don't say anything. We're gonna bust you out of here.

What?

Are you in?

Where is it?

Naw, I think I'm through with fads for a while.

Come on, Kenny! 

What?

Um I think we're just heading deeper into the mountains.

You should probably listen to him, dude.

No way!

I can see your lips moving!

No. That's the same branch again.

It's my seat ring. I have to sit on it because of my hemorrhoid.  Ow.

Hello, ma'am. My name is Kyle. And this is Cartman. We'd like to share our interest in David Blaine with you.

Mee tooo.

It's Cartman's stupid online persona!

Totally! I totally understand!

Dude, where in the world can Britney Spears go where nobody will bother her?

Stan? Stan, I think we should talk.

No, she wasn't!

So then why do you just ignore it using something as stupid as Chipotaway?

Stan?

That's it, Stan! I'm not sitting through a whole movie with you! 

No, dude, you don't wanna bring your people to Mexico, there's missionaries there, too.

I'm coming, Ma! 

What the hell are they doing??

Will you stop saying that word?!

No! We can't divide like this!  Stan?  You're on our side, right?

Sure. Come on, guys. 

So where are students getting all this cough medicine??  This surveillance footage shows a group of troubled kids getting all the smack they want from a pharmacist!  Sexy Action School News reported the pharmacist to the South Park police, and he was immediately arrested! 

This is your fault, Cartman! Now we're gonna fail!

Get up, fat boy! I'm gonna kick your ass!

We're gonna win $10,000! 

All right, fine. I'll do the dumb test.

We came on our own 'cause our friend's purity ring is killing him.

Carman, will you shut up? I'm trying to find out what's going on.

Stan can't come.

Carpal tunnel! Carpal tunnel! It's aaaah! 

Chef, we wanna know about herpes.

Pansy.

Whoa!

Um...  Greetings from Canada.  Well boys, it's aboot time we get to our hoose in Canada, isn't it?

I'm a clinically depressed fecophiliac on Prozac.

What's a "home-schooled kid"?

Hey dude, how's it going?

We won! We won!

That's 19 bucks, Kenny! 

Hey!  How about Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo?

...Really??

Guys, stop, stop!  We don't have to do this!

Yep. But I guess this proves that war is the natural order of life.

Yeah... Chef, what's "laid"?

Who the hell is that?

Dude, why aren't people coming to help us?

Great.

Didn't you forget something?

Ohh, dude!

I don't believe it.

Aw, sick! 

You know God-damn well what! Now get outta here!

Stan? 

Wow!

Wait! 

It's just a marketing ploy by the network. Like that time they had the first male-to-male kiss with Terrance and Phillip?

Maybe they should project the movies on Cartman's ass. 

This isn't paradise and you know it! The people here are starving and dying! The whole world has used Somalia as a dumping ground for toxic waste. Even the fish here are radioactive!  Cartman, just give me my brother  and let us get out of here!

Help? How can you help?

Dude, we're totally lost! We're gonna die out here!

Well, actually, Cartman's getting a nurection. But then, we're gonna give it you. Sooo, buck up! 

Satan talked to God?

How, how long do we have to take the shuttle?

It's not my fault.

What?

I need to book one trip to the moon, please. Right away.

Yeah! You're dressed up like the South.

Cartman!!  You fucking fatass!

But... they were here. Ah I swear it. Stacks and stacks of ballots from states all over the country!

How is that spying?!

You just want Family Guy off the air...

Wait. You guys, I have an awesome idea! We should secretly go around and tell all the students we can, to not check any of the mascots on this election sheet, and instead write in "Giant Douche."

I'm not cheesing. I've never cheesed once in my life.

Oh, thank God!

You just feel bad for yourself that you're in detention!

All right, hit it.

...Chef?? A-are you okay?

Dude, did Cartman just crap treasure?

I got through. Hello, police?

Yeah, probably 'cause General Tso's chicken. 

I think out band better buy a whole bunch of music CDs to listen to for inspiration.

Look out! Here comes the great dragon of Perengraph!

See? I told you, dude. Those are dialysis machines.  Old people have to hook themselves into it with a tube, and it sucks all their body fluids out.

Cartman?!

I got voted the ugliest boy in the whole class?

Okay, sorry, sorry.

Ike!  Ike, you're back!

What??

I'm poopies, ma!

Cartman, shut up. We're concentrating. 

I'm the whole solar system! The planets even all revolve the right way. That tub of candy is as good as mine!

What?

You aren't just gonna hand Snowball over?

That's it!

Well-. Huwhat is it, Mr. Hankey?

What??

We're sorry, Mayor.

God damn it!  Wendy, Stan wants to know why you break up. 

It's still stupid and now I paid 49 cents for it!

Dude, we have to get to the mall!!

Dude, that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

I dunno!  Try "strangetamer."

We're making the news more appealing to students.

I thought it was "plane-tarium."

Really?

We'll just tell your parents we're going on a camping trip with my parents. They'll never know.

Mr. Hankey!

You kick ass, evil Cartman!

Uuuh, we didn't get them.

Not like that!

This is gonna be sweet!

I don't know what to do.  Part of me feels like I wanna end it all now.  Tell people what heppened. You know, I never knew how beautiful this pond was before.  So cold. The world can feel like that.  So calm on the outside, as if nothing bad ever happens.  Ow.  What the hell are you doing, Cartman?!

All I wanted was to play one level of Call of Duty and you know what Ike told me? He said the living room was for old people.

Oh, dude, what a little asshole!

A band! Holy shit, Stan! Didn't you say your dad knows somebody who knows Lorde?

Cartman, you're supposed to be studying! What the hell is all this?!

It's my name, and I found him.

Wait a minute, the rights to Star Wars, the movies? What the hell is going on here?!

Yeah. They've kinda killed Kenny -'s look-alike. You bastards!

Mom, Dad!

Boy it sure is dry out here.

What exactly can I do to help?

What the hell are you doing?!

What'd he say?

Who's that?

I said Ike's on fire!

What?!

Nah. Dude, I totally spaced it. 

Get the hell off me! You're a freak, Butters! You can't play with us!

Ssso it was all for nothing. The whole time I was... eating farts for nothing.

Okay, I'm gonna go grab mine. I have an idea.

Yeah.  He's getting... really high on life. 

Cartman, open this door right now!

Give me that!  Hey! It hit her right in the mouth!

Die! 

That's not cool!

Not if somebody took pictures without her knowing.

Yeah, but he's some kind of genius, so he's getting advanced placement in kindergarten.

An apology?!

Oh my God!

See ya.

Oh. Ah-ah. Ah-uh-m-m.

No.

I TIVO every episode. We can go to my house and see what they did.

No way, dude! It sucked ass! They don't even have cable!

Eh I, I don't know what else to paint.

Get it! 

I dunno.

You see anything, Kenny??

No, no, w-we we really did write it. Tell them, Butters.

Some kids think I'm strange 'cause I like studying for an exam
But I don't let that bother me, because it's who I am. 

I have no idea.

Stan? Stan?? 

...Yeah. So?

Uh

No matter what we think, it's not just a passing trend. We need to realize that the new generation of entertainment is here.  And I, think that's great.

It's too late for that. Things just can't go back, Stan, uh.  Ah-I'm with Cartman Burger now.

Dammit!

That's us!  "Dear MOOP. This letter is to inform you that Faith Plus One's debut album has just sold one million copies."

Mr. Garrison, I'm the only one here. Everyone else has chicken herpes.

We're gonna make a short animated Christmas card that everyone can watch and play it on the screen at the old drive-in.

Dude, it's Cartman. He's just being a dumb-ass like always.

Fuck off, Cartman!

Dude. I don't think I wanna be a part of this anymore.

Ah, I thought we were speaking for the children.

Hey, where the hell are you going?? 

Phew.

Guantanamo Bay?! We can't go to Guantanamo Bay!

Knock it off, Cartman!

Oh God! It wasn't thirty, it was one! He jumped over one homeless person with his stupid skateboard, and he barely made it over that guy!

You bastards!

Dude, come on.

Dude, go to Hell!

There's not gonna be any robot guards, retard! Just get Kenny! 

Kill Jesus! Yesss! Arrrgh! 

How much?

Dad.

I don't know. Last night we found him hiding in the kitchen pantry. He was screaming the name "Billy Mays" over and over again.

Yeah, what do you guys wanna do now?

Now, that's what I call a sticky situation. 

Cool, thanks.

Did you guys hear what's going on? There's like four girls at the school now offering to kiss boys for money.

How is that gonna help?

Wow, cool!

Okay. So we put little "woo" mouths on all our heads.  And then we shoot that for one frame.

What? No?!

Stan...  Do you really think my hat is stupid?

This is not a woman! It is a succubus!

Wow, what did you write about Cartman?

You know what I like best about you? You don't say, "hella," like our Cartman does. I swear, if he says that one more time, I'm gonna kill him! 

Even the dumbest lie can have big consequences.

All right, fine!

Yeah. Mine says 'Red Mega Man'.

Hey look, Kenny's okay.

Wull yeah, but ah-I got my brother back.

I guess so. She's, like, his first real girlfriend ever.

I can't understand him.

Just admit it, Congo! Admit that you lied about me to Irene!

No, not ham, you fat fuck!

Nobody believes in you, not even my friends.

Ye-yes.

Cartman!

Well, everyone in the world thinks you are. See ya. 

Kenny, all you did after the cat peed in your face was start running around in circles cheering.

Hey! My dad's pretty cool, too.

That guy is wearing a digital watch.

Yeah, but if they're wrong, no big deal. If we're wrong, we burn in hell.

Oh that's a good idea. 

What, Cartman?

Dude.

I wonder why our moms want us to sleep over at Kenny's so bad.

All I wanted was to play one level of Call of Duty and you know what Ike told me? He said the living room was for old people.

Where did that come from??

Wendy, nothing's gonna happen to the egg. You can have it when the week is over and I have my grade.  Freakin' weirdos, man.

Oh, just this really really old lady who wishes she was still only 45. 

You have that power too?

...What?

It happens to be called poutine in Montreal! 

We're in business!

But what if we're wrong?

The kindergarten teacher is having sex with my little brother.

Do you kow where your doll is?

They're evil! I WISH I DIDN'T HAVE ANY PARENTS!

Dude, thank God for stupid people 

You said "fuck you" to my face, Stan.

Whoa! Maybe you can kiss her.

How was jail, fatass?!

Okay!

Is this all you brought us here to see?

That doesn't count, fatass!

It didn't work! My stupid Jew dad won't lend me money for CDs!

Yeah, it's called a town.

Me??!

Where's your lunch, Butters?

Jesus Christ, finally!

Not your dad, Cartman! What's your dad got to do with this?!

Would you stop scaring everyone with your dumb ass myth!

Oh. Really?

My name. Is not. "Kyel."

There, ten mediums and five medium-rares.

Wow, I wish we had a stupidest home video. 

What the hell is that?  Oh my God. 

How do you know...  that wasn't your therapy? 

We can eat it at Cartman's house, and see more naughty pictures of his mom.

I think his pants are falling down.

Shut up, Cartman!

Hey! Hey, let me out of here! This is a mistake! I agreed by accident!

Mr. Jefferson just seems like he wants to be a kid, not have one.

Yes he does!

Dude, I don't think we should be messing around with that crap anymore.

Dude, is that your dad?

What?

Yeah, but now you can be friends with all of us!

Uh I'm trying, Mr. Mackey, I really am.

We're not gonna hurt her, we just need some of her blood.

He just said... "Where's Stan?"

You sold us out?! For an iPod Nano?!

Yeah. See ya. 

A big success?! You can't even get Tyler Perry to go back home!

Yup. I'm not seeing anything.

What a baby.

Ech, even if it could work, how would we go about shutting it down?

We gotta run! 

Just admit you were lying, Cartman, so that everyone can go home!

Aw dude, this is really hard.

You've got the best balls in the whole world, Chef.

Do you see anything?

There's still time to tell the network president you're full of CRAP! 

Jesus, behind you! 

Yeah, good idea. 

How's it going?

I know, dude! Let's get the hell out of here! 

Yeah Stan, she's just a girl.

Dude, you had waffles for breakfast, huh?!

Ya see Ike? There's nothing. There's nothing for you to be afraid of.

What the hell have you gotten me into?!

Dude, totally. With Kenny's Magic skills, we could probably kick serious ass!

You've gotta try and stay on for ten seconds. Okay, Cartman?

Don't panic. I'll tell you what to say.  You can tell them...

All right, where are the missing ballots?!  President Obama?

Would you please just open your wormhole?!

All right, let's see.  Dammit Kenny, that's not what she said!

...Uuh, can I talk to her?

Oolala 

Yeah. Thanks, dick!

French Canada?

That's two against one, 'cause Stan doesn't care. So it's giant douche.

Yeah. It happened once before.

Fine! 

That's the most horrible story I've ever heard. Why would God do such a horrible thing to a good person just to prove a point to Satan?

Why?

Ah! Ow! Hey, it hurts!  Owie-ow! Help! Ow, that hurts!

Dude, we'll have Chef's $2 million in no time!

Oh brother!

Screw you, fatass! 

Except for us.

Ah, damn it!

Who's Honey Boo Boo?

You yourself led the campaign against the colorization of films. You understand why films shouldn't be changed.

Cartman!

And that's why I feel like you guys are more than just friends. You're my family.  Except for Cartman.

Jesus Christ!

Okay.

Hoh, Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,

Huh?

That doesn't make any sense.

Going to Afghanistan? Locked in a small space for 20 hours? How could things get any worse? 

Ike, you'll always be my little brother, okay?

You need to freeze some of your ass off.

Hey!

Yeah.

Cartman?

Dude, you're just saying that because she's your girlfriend.

God-dammit Cartman! You broke it!

Hepatitis B?

What happened? It just didn't work out?

Dude! What the hell is going on?!

You con-fessed?

We have to get our friend, Steve-

Mom, Dad, have you ever met Ike's kindergarten teacher? 

What do you mean, fatass?

Oh... Okay.

Chr, what could you possibly have in your room that could change the outcome of the election? 

All right. Thanks for your help, dudes.  Well, we did it, guys. It wasn't easy, but... we did a really amazing thing.

Couple of days?  But Terrance is going to have his human clone by tomorrow.

Cartman, what the hell are you doing?! You're suppsoed to be studying! 

Where did everybody go?

Don't, don't act for me, Stan! Really?! Because every minute I'm watching this video become less about awareness and more about you!

All right!  Ow. Hm. 

Hey, you're not such a bad guy after all, Damien.

Now we just gotta wait for his urection, and I can give it to my dad.

I totally know how we can give the gingers and the celebrities what they want, but keep Muhammad safe. Come on! 

Got it!

What's up?

That's a towel call?

I was just explaining how a negative argument doesn't make a po-

Tweek.  Pip

Cartman, we should probably talk about our chances.

But we could get killed!

Damn it!

Oh, my God! 

Uh okay! No problem! 

Chef, does poo go to heaven?

...No. Way.

Yeah, it's just so astounding.

What's that, dude?

No dude, screw that! Jimmy, if Cartman didn't write the joke, then definitely don't sign any patent papers with him! Just say "Cartman, you didn't have anything to do with this joke and you know it!"

Nobody wants any of your stuff, you fat bitch!

Excuse me.  Do you know which way the network president's office is?

Please stop.

Rainforests suck! I wanna go home!

What is this? What's going on?

Two hundred dollars?

But I don't care.

They were wearing cowboy hats!  Did you see??  Did you see?? 

You ready for the big show, Timmy?

So what happens now?

Uh, nice costume, dude. Who are you supposed to be? Luke Perry?

You guys wanna see how long I can hold my breath under water?

Okay, Mr. Marsh. 

Cartman!

Look! Crack addicts with a television! 

What about you?

Hello? 

What?

No more money??

Dude! Our parents sent us over there to get us sick!

Hey, yeah! I almost forgot.

Yeah, it was the craziest thing. I hid myself on a plane to Antarctica. Oh, it was so dry down there.

Who are you?

Ack dude! 

Dammit, Cartman, open up!

Where does that grill go?

We're here dude. Just a little further and we can finally end this.

Mr. Hankey! 

You can't do that! 

The Diamond of Pantheos.  She must be powerless now.

All that time and effort we spent helping Token and this is the thanks we get?!

Dude, just ask Chef for help. He always knows what to do.

Just because two people are the same race doesn't mean they belong together, you fat racist piece of fucking garbage!

You can't talk to Stan, Wendy. He throws up when you do.

Yeah, what a stupid sport! 

I guess we should all realize...  that history and alien technology really do go hand in hand. 

Uh, could you use it in a sentence?

Mr. Derp?

Suddenly, Stan says he knows about some horse stables. Ih it seemed too good to be true.

Ha ha, you look like a pansy.

No.

Really?

Bloody butt cough.

Yeah, take that!

No, it's great! It's just what this country needs right now!

Dude, what are you doing?!

This looks like the right room.

I don't believe it.

So... why would one come to America to warn us about a terrorist attack.

Eric Cartman can never know about this.

No.

Jesus Christ!

How... How did this happen?  Mom, Dad? Why are you shopping here?

That's not what she said. You're putting extras on again. It's not that funny.

Whoa, dude!

It's right over here by uh-

Damnit!

Copy, tango. Clear vantage point?

Dude, I don't think this is very sturdy. 

Mph. Okay, Mr. Hankey. We're out. How are you doin'?

What do you think, Stan. These girls are pretty cute, huh?

Who cares if your dog is gay? Maybe it's not that bad.

No, I'm serious! I wanna see what's happening downstairs, so let's just do it! 

Butters, get away from me!

Yeah, what are we supposed to do?

Sir, you recently passed a new law allowing parents who have given their children up for adoption to change their minds. My little brother was-

But I feel like a basketball player. That's all I wanna do. 

Yeah, I think so.

Did so! Did so!

Oh, jeez, we're gonna have to buy tons of these things.

Kathie Lee is coming to South Park?

I don't know!

Hey Cartman! We're almost to level 20! You giving birth in there, or what?

Owatta Beikoku! 

I thought you said the wonder of Mother Nature was a beautiful thing.

I don't care if I signed an agreement!

Dude, what do you mean "We don't have a coach."?

You can't do what he wants just because he's the one threatening you with violence!

Yeah. And I think I figured out why.

Oh my God, dude!

Yeah, the High Elf. He'll know what to do. 

But don't tell anybody we have them.

Mom, it was nothing. Mohammad just stood there and then drank some tea.

Dude, no one even listened to me.

Wow. Barbrady sure is acting weird.

CHEF! 

Like what?

Yeah. She is.

You son of a bitch.  You didn't solve your homeless problem, you just sent all your homeless to South Park! 

Dude, my mom and dad keep fighting all the time. And both of them say it's because my dad doesn't have a nurection. So I want to get him one.  Damn it! What the hell is wrong with everybody? 

Why don't you just sneak in your mom's closet and get a picture when she's changing clothes?

But dude, there must be something in your past you're not dealing with.

Okay, it's third down. And now, somebody make a play!

Well, yeah, but what if the grampa wants to die, cause he's really old, and he's just asking for help?

So we're not TP'ing a house with kids inside it!

Butters, Butters, I'm, I'm kind of super busy right now.

Everyone is watching everything.  Ike?  Ike, if you can hear me, I'm sorry. I have been a grandpa.  I didn't understand the things you are into and I and I thought you should like the same stuff that I did.  I have to accept that you're gonna have your own things. I just didn't want you to watch HIM. I just... I just wanna be a family again.

Well I don't know. You're just the only grownup we trust.

Yeah. Let's just have a slumber party here.

(You're fine!)

Cartman?

Okay, go ahead. 

Would you excuse us for a second?  You just can't expect me to sit there and say nothing. No, Ike, I'm supposed to be looking out for you. So what? I wasn't going to just blurt it out, I was gonna use some tact, but you won't even let me... What? Uh uh! Stop right there, Ike!  Mom, I think maybe you should talk to Ike about love and sex!

Ih ih ih-t's g-gay?

He doesn't even let me near him!

I don't know about this guys. I think playing hide and seek in the airport might be dangerous.

"My parents molestered me."

Listen, you don't have to do this! Our imaginations aren't running wild anymore.

Sure. Sh-sure, Mr. Hankey.

Alright, Cartman, joke's over. 

"So this is how America works. We have gods and clods. My dad says America needs both rich and poor to survive, but I have a better idea."

Uh, Kenny McHeinenberg.

Whoa.

Yeah. Check it out.  Ready Ike? Kick the baby!

You bastards!

I'm last? Last?

What?! Does everybody have to do it, or just me?

Thanks.

It was a fake!

Bleuh-leuh-leuh-leuh-leuh.

I don't really give a fuck! 

It just ran by here a second ago. 

(Yes. I promise I'll read.)

I mean, that if-

My mom is gonna break my legs!

Yeah! 

I know who.

Yeah dude, we made you your own Facebook page. 

It wasn't my idea to burn the Wall-Mart down.

Dude, if these guys are as bad as you say, then we have to do something!

It's not working here?

Nobody else is going to help him, you guys. We've got a chance to do something pretty special here. Are you with us?

I swear, Stan.

I know. Something big is going on. Take a look at this. I did a Google search for "Hillary Clinton Campaign Rally" right? And one of the links was to YouTube, where this Russian guy had a bunch of videos.

Dude! All those choirs are the same. They don't even really sing. They use prerecorded tapes.

I hate being small and Jewish. I feel like a tall black man.

Time for you to get proven wrong, fat boy.

We need you, Butters. You're the man! 

Wait a minute. Who is that?

Yeah!

Genetic Engineering Ranch!  Sweet!

So what number was I??

Did you send the videotape to America's Stupidest Home Videos?

Yeah, I don't even know if I'm gonna watch it anymore.

Eh now,  come on, you guys, we can't take this decision lightly. Whoever we pick is going to be the person we do everything with from now on.

Come on, Steve, you're going to Des Moines!

Dude, where is she gonna get fetus clothes?

Because they taste so yummy. 

Mom! Dad!

Do you see him?

Our parents won't let us have weapons, dude. 

She said they're from New Jersey.

Yeah. Look what he did to our friend, Kenny.

Oh geez. Maybe we let this thing get out of hand. This issue is so complicated, but... m-maybe we sh-should just let Kenny go in peace.

No dude, Butters' pee is in there.

My Dad says he can't live here anymore.

And then like, out of nowhere, somebody came up with the idea of ziplining.

I don't get it, Kenny: why do you buy razors and shaving cream?

It doesn't matter. He'll be most excited to meet me!

Good idea.

You okay, bro?

Phil Collins is playing Lalapalala's, and because we're all doing so well in school now, our parents said they would take us.

Look, Stam, we-we just wanted to be able to go to the movies and enjoy ourselves, you know? I'm sorry but... you're a bummer to be around. Everything is "that looks like shit" and, and "this is shitty!"

Look, that was a long time ago. Maybe Trent Boyett has forgotten all about it.

I wonder how come Cartman's not in school today?

Do it! Do it!

I'm not inviting you, Cartman. You can't go.

I agree with Cartman!

Yeah, you are! You always get in trouble

Okay, so how do we get my little brother back?

What?

What??

Do the right thing, Mr. President.

Yeah, I know, but I have to-

Which button did you press, Cartman??

Here! Here's the phone! 

Stan, we can't be seen with this nutjob!  Aw, aw, awww!

So, here we go. 

Dude, we have got to get that kid away from him!

I don't think they're going to be able to get all of you in frame Cartman.

We're all gonna pitch in on an entry!
Hello, sir. Welcome to the Broflovski Laundromat.

Aaaa! 

Wait. Stan?  Hold on, is this my virtual reality, or Cartman's virtual reality?

What is a proc-tologist, Chef?

No!

Calm down, dude. You're upsetting Kenny.

What? How do you know?

Your heart?

What?!

Yeah. Good job, fatass! 

Yeah, but, why can't XBox automatically let you pre-order Metal Gear Solid V?

All right. Thanks a lot for helping us, dude.

Oh my God! You did lie to me.

Ow. Quit it!

And then takes you to Chipotle, and buys you more?

Mom, Dad, can I have money to buy Chinpokomon?

Code 7! Bring in the firemen!

Butters, what the hell are you doing?!

I don't need Ike listening to you comment on anything!

Shut up Terrance, we can geneti-cal engineer anything we want.

Oh this is sweet. I've seen this episode.

Kenny! Noooooo!

Yes, whatever you want. 

Ahh-d, excuse me, sir, did I hear you say you needed somebody for your show?

Yeah. He's almost as bad as that guy on Full House.

It's a surprise.

Dude, maybe we should give up!

Hey yeah! What's that song she always sings? There's got to be a morning after.

And, and hey, if for some reason Butters can't go to Casa Bonita, you can take his place.

Well, we just thought we'd let you know. See ya.

Because we do. It was like this yesterday, and the day before that.

What do ya mean?

Nuh uh.

What the heck is that? 

Well, what about our pot-bellied elephant?

Whoa.

WHY ARE THEY DOING THIIIS?!

Oh, whatever. 

Oh wait, wait, there's kids inside.

Eh, oh, alright. 

Yeah.

Since Abraham, fatass!

Yeah. Actually, there is.

Yeah. How'd you know?

Where's your present, Cartman?

A reindeer?

Dude! I had the same dream! We jumped on a dragon's back and, and Butters got left behind!

What?!

Yes.

But I have to get off!

I was in the bathroom-

Just let us stay up a little longer, mom. Mr. Hankey's gotta show up. He always does.

Oh.

Awww! 

I guess you should leave police work to the professionals, huh, Cartman?

It means Jehovah is going to use his powers to keep the Pharaoh from letting us go.

Hey!

He knew he had to take us all home, too, right?

Yeah? Well Butters is ten! He doesn't exactly know what's best for him and neither do you!

Please, just, just leave it alone, Stan. Everything is as it has to be.

Ot- Nice to meet you, Cartman. Yuh you know, I saw that same jacket you're wearing at Bosco's for $29.95. How much was yours? Um, I juh- I was just wondering if Bosco's is a ripoff?

Ow! Quit it, dude!

What the hell?

Why?

Yeah, but you know, I've learned something today. It would have been wrong to exploit Butters' weight loss. Because then lots of fat people would have believed it. And then gone and eaten a ton of Chinese food instead of dieting properly. They'd still be fat and, we'd be responsible for their shattered dreams.

I'll go.

Yeah, you can't get it if you don't breathe.

Well then they're not minorities, are they?

Uh. My adopted brother got taken back here to Canada? So, we want to talk to the new Canadian Prime Minister about getting him back?

That's what they're talking about on the news!

Hey! Hey, stop it! Stop!

Dude, we're not killing Sarah Jessica Parker! 

All right, all right, I was not responsible for 9/11!  God-damnit!

Because, dude, we're playing detectives! Detectives don't just go tell on people.

Hey, Jesus! Ih-if you win the fight, can you turn Kenny back to normal?

I thought of it first!

Hey, it's a fire. That means there must be people. 

What are you doing?! 

Kenny, we know you really like this girl, but...

Don't fail us! We'll be right there!

Cyborg Bill isn't cool anymore?

Well, you guys can do what you want! I'm going down to that church to confess my sins and eat crackers! And I'm taking Ike with me! 

Mom. Mom. I found out all about this great new magician named David Blaine.

Well it-... it's okay. there's no denying it all worked out for the best this time a-.

Our whole weekend is shot.

You say tomato, but I say Kenny!

Well, how about we just say, "corporates should be stopped"?

Is this the right house?

Comoe back here! 

No dude, that makes you gay!

Benedict Arnold. 

You can't sit with us, new kid. Go find another table! 

Nono wait. I I know how you can reverse it, Cartman.

Could it be?

Why didn't you tell me, Stam? I would've helped.

But the guy who replaced him sucks!

I dunno. I just have this sudden urge to go back.

Shut up, fatass!!

Ok-okay.  Stan? Stan?

He looks fine.

How do know that?

Crud! 

Dude, you killed your own dad, and you're worried about that?!

Oh, no thanks. We don't do that stuff.

There's some terrorists or bankrobbers or something that have taken our class hostage!

I told you guys he'd be here!

No, it doesn't!

(I can't take it! I want out right now!)

Yeah, check this one out. Ready, Ike? Kick the baby!

Huh?

Butters, people can't just go around beating up people who have diabetes! Now whatever your problem is, you just-

They didn't believe me. They thought I was pitching a movie.

Alright, Butters. Bring it in.

Let go of me.

Yeah, but maybe we need a name that's more affirming, like, shows what we stand for.

You'd miss the new trailer?

I am Tooth Decay. Your teeth shall be mine. With candy and treats I will take-

I... don't... have... any... friends...

It isn't fair!  I don't want to be an outcast!

Yeah. Well, she likes Ike a whole lot.

What??

No dude, we can't go around showing our weapons to people. Our parents'll find out we have them.

Don't you guys think this is a little suspicious? We should buy something else so it doesn't look obvious.

Hang in there, Ike. We're gonna get you help.

Screw you guys, I'm king lesbian!

I can do it. It just got... look, it just doesn't matter, because it's not true.

Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,

What am I going to do? My little brother's been abducted by aliens.  You farted. 

We couldn't get trapped here forever, Cartman. We'd die after a couple of days. 

Quick. Hide. 

Is it like a- haunted house or something?

Oh yeah.  Fine, I'll kick your ass tomorrow, dick! 

Told ya.

Weirdo. 

I'm not Britney Spears, all right?!

You can raise $2 million, dude. We'll help you.

The new kid.

Butters!

Cartman! We've been brainwashed, don't you see? We don't have to do this!

Cool. Cool... You wanna order some dessert?

They sneak out during class and make out in the hallways!

Come on, dude. We've gotta get out of here. I don't know what they're planning next, but it can't be good! 

Wow, that'd be cool.

I'm sure. Abe Lincoln was right: I don't wanna find out I'm good-looking and become a total shithead when I grow up.

If they give you something small, will you end the strike?

Mr. Garrison, it's Kyle! Our egg is okay! We'll be there in a couple of minutes!

No! It's alright! Just give me some time to work on them. I'll see you guys later. 

You guys go tell Butters to start making the cutoouts. I'm gonna go tell Mr. Hankey the good news!

Yeah. Come in for a minute, would you?

How long has it been since you've been back there.

God-damnit!

What the hell for?!

You don't wanna eat it?

Jesus, this sucks! All they keep doin' is dancing around!

Alright, fine!  You're the spokesman, Cartman! But you'd better not screw it up!

Hey, let's ask them. 

Kenny! 

Tweek's gonna fight Craig!

Don't you oppress me, fat boy.

The heart of Wall-Mart?

Come on, Stan. Hospitals aren't all that bad.

Eewww.

...Power.

Boy, it looks like you're not welcome anywhere elephant.  See ya. 

Cartman, you fatass tattle-tale!

What has this world come to? Where people can just... take your Okama GameSphere.

Dude, where have you been?

Killer.

What?

I don't know.

So, you guys are totally broken up then? It's... done?

All right, let's go.

Four.

We're eating, dude.

I can't wait to see him!  He's gonna be so glad we came!

All these people are going to be gaming on XBox. You really wanna just game with Craig the rest of your life?

Come on, you guys! We better get to work! 

Whoa, dude!

Yeah? Okay, and you checked with Kenny and Token? He's not just staying at their houses?

Uh, hi. Is, uh, is Rebecca home?

Well I didn't have her do it. She did it on her own.

Goddamnit, you know I don't carry gold in a little bag around my neck, Cartman! Whattaya want from me?!

Well, you might have made it, but we're the ones who are taking care of it now. You have your own egg to look out for!

What the hell is wrong with them? 

Screw you, fat ass!

Dude, he needs us right now.

Dude, I don't understand hunting at all.

Isn't that fascism?

Oh well, at least as president you can run the school the way you want.

It's the only way to prove to them that you're real.

I'm... glad... that you guys can just keep living. I don't think I can. 

Do you really think that beating up a handicapped kid is being nice? 

Tango, this is Foxtrot. Are you in position?

Yeah. Closure.

I think so. Is Cartman up there?

This itches! Give me some of that calamine lotion, Cartman.

All right! Things just might work out!

I can seriously hold my breath longer than anybody. Somebody time me, all right?

You bastards!

No, dude! We have to name it Steve.

So?!

Of course, dumbass, it's Halloween.

Here, give me that.  "I am Bumbly Wumbly. I live in the pond."

That's it?

Aw, he's dead?

Look, we could we could probably get Terrance, but he'll be performing with this other guy.

It says right there "a parent has to be with you to sign up," and you'll never get your mom to agree to something so horrible, so ha! 

Yeah, I c- I can't believe it.

Dude, what?!

I know. It's probably gonna be the biggest night of our lives!

You got Randy Newman to do the theme song. You're not trying that hard. Token, you're a good kid. How can you sit there and collect money on a show that's about a, about a fat child killing himself?? Where's your sense of shame??

Butters wrote a second book!

Dude, some people really do consider this obscene.

That's it? That's all they did?

Ike found out last night. My mom's having sex with the UPS man.

Yeah! We did it, you guys! 

Why?

What? Are you sure?

You have to! Here, have some more mayonnaise. 

City Wok brought him down to a size 4.

We've got to get him back, dude.

People don't hate the Jews!

And Stan for being in love with Wendy.

But if the tape must be brought to the House of Butters, who else can do it?

Dude! He turned Kenny into a duck-billed platypus.

Really? What about?

I can't believe it!

Dude...

Wait! Stop! Could I have your attention, please?

I don't wanna go to your stupid movie premiere!  And don't tape that to my locker!  Oh God. 

Cartman, were you... crying?

The new neighbors that moved in next to Stan's house. Me and Ike saw the mom get a parking ticket, and she called the parking cop "muff cabbage".

Yeah. No more getting pushed around by fourth graders! 

Well, I was talking to Cartman, too!

Yeah. They're tryin' to scare everybody 'cause they're gay wads.

Dude, hold on! This is bullcrap! If they wanna live in our time, then they should learn our language!

Yeah. We're having him resurrurected.

Well what the hell are we gonna do? Dress him up in a princess gown and, and parade him around like the parents on those awful child pageants? 

Cartman?!

He worked so hard, come so close. Now we'll never see Kenny crawl up into Ms. Crabtree's uterus.

Okay, you can come with us.

Hoh, dude, weak.

Do you really think your civilization is better than ours?! You people play games by killing animals, and oppress women!

All that hard work.

It... doesn't... quite roll off the tongue.

So what?

Yeah!  I was just hanging out in my room, and then I perioded all over the place.

I'm NOT a GRANDPA!

Alright, Dad! 

Oh, okay. Cool. 

"stick it inside her and pee"

Ike, you're okay. 

Why won't anybody listen to me?!

Yeah, but we didn't believe them.

I'll never forget you. You were my best friend after Stan.

Listen, aggotfay! An ailnay ilefay so you can eakbray out of isonpray!

There's no choice anymore, guys. Don't worry about me. I've been preparing for this for a while now. 

We really think this is gonna work, Stan. All we have to do is convince your dad that his cooking sucks, right?

You mean he's actually stuck in virtual reality?!

...Scotch?

Cartman, what the hell is this?! 

So you're gonna help us?

Who said that?

Butters, I think you should reconsider this.

Ike! Do your impersonation of David Caruso's career!

Well, we've got something to tell you about Veronica, Chef!

Well, Craig showed up.

He doesn't get cake?

That's not funny.

Aw, dude! You can still kinda see the spleen!  How much, Kenny?

Come on, hurry it up in there! 

Whoa! They gave you an anal probe Cartman?

Yeah, let's watch Yo Gabba Gabba, like old times.

Not now, Mom. Please.

That's it!  I don't care about the fate of the world! Screw it!

Helping my Dad give people fake tickets. 

Yeah, sweet! Maybe we can get a reward for the frozen guy!

That is gross!!

We don't want you to die.

Really?

Dude, they've been doing that for a long time.

No, it's not cool!

Yeah.

Yeah.

I was the one. I was too afraid to say anything, but I can't let Kenny be sock-bathed for it.

Hey.  That's a great idea!

How about we revamp the name? Super School News sounds dry.

So you fucked a bunch of chickens?

Come on! 

Holy crap!!

We don't have respect for Mr. Garrison.

I just do, Stan.

Oh, you're doing it, or else we're gonna bust your whole scheme wide open, and tell your mom you haven't actually been at your drug rehab this whole time!

What?  What??

They did it! They got it working! 

What is happening to our living rooms? There is a crisis in America, and-

I wanted to make sure, too.

Oo whataya mean?

Here! Here, I found one!

Yeah, so, where are they. Let's go get 'em.

Check it out: Now we're going into the secret underground base.

Yeah. I think maybe everything is gonna be okay now.

We are raising money so that Chef can hire Johnnie Cochran to sue you!

George Bush?

I said go away!  My father said you aren't real.

Uh, hi. Our friend joined your club a while back, and now he wants to molest kids. 

I am not, not, d-rinking pee!

Ehheh, Cartman, what the hell are you doing?

Throw 'em away!  Dudes, here he comes. Guys, stop coughing. 

Well you're NOT crazy. The whale talked to all of us. And he needs our help getting him home.

Dude, I guess we've just got to try it without him.

Well come on! We gotta tell you what happened. I'm sure glad it's over with. 

What?

Oh... Oohh—Ohuhughughhh... 

Uhhh... I'm not sure.

See, when you start invading people's privacy, eh thinking it's harmless to put up pictures of them they didn't want up - Kenny! - you start a domino effect that eventually screws everything up for everybody!

What's that?

It's out of control! 

You're such a dumbass, Cartman. 

...You're an asshole, Cartman.

Cartman? Cartman?? 

Yeah, that's awesome.

Guys, Ike has gotten worse. I'm really worried about him. He says he's still seeing dead celebrities.

Yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy.

Uuuh, Cartman. We know how you can get $3000.

What's wrong with his face?

I... what? 

Just go. Go without me.

Wow! 

You guys, who cares if the girls make some stupid list? Girls make dumb lists all the time.

All right. Come on you guys, we have to get back home. 

Yeah!

That does it. I'm out. 

Cool.

Look man, w-we know what you learned was pretty tough to hear.

Yeah.

Well what the hell are you doing?! This isn't gonna work now!

Grrhh, whatever. 

Yup!

Fine!

You better watch what you say Cartman! You might be poor and hungry some day.

Jeez, he's worse than I thought.

I can't believe it. I can't believe we have to keep on playing.

AAAAAAAAAA! 

Dad, I think Ike is starving to death. 

Wow, cool.

They're TV dinners. Don't you wanna take that veil off so you can eat?

Who the hell are these guys?

...Where did you have sex with her?

I'll kill you, Triceratops! You made fun of my crippled mother!

How do we have a choice?!

What the hell??

Officer Barbrady, I would like to reinstate my previous Shenanigans! This whole carnival is a rip-off!

Whoa, dude! 

Uh, why not?

Okay, fine, Butters. But if you're gonna hang out with us, you have to play like Lord of the Rings. 

Yeah. Cartman's weight was what gave us speed, so we need to find the next-fattest kid besides Cartman. 

Nuh-uh.

Woah... wait, what are you doing?

Nono, you're right. Somalia is an oasis of treasure and waterfalls. It's totally the pirate's life.

No way! You wanna go with us so you can betray us at some point and keep us from destroying the Wall-Mart.

Oh.  No you didn't!

Gracias.

What the hell happened?!

Yes, I believe that you believe you helped write that joke. That's how people like you work! Your ego is so out of whack that it will do whatever it can to protect itself. And people with a messed up ego can do these mental gymnastics to convince themselves they're awesome, when really, they're just douchebags! 

Ike, can I talk to you? 

I can't believe how cold it is out here.

Cool!

Don't get scared up in the mountains Cartman.

You aren't gonna get away with this you stupid asshole! 

I don't think it matters, dude. This giant snake is gonna kill everyone soon. 

Omigod! Omigod! Omigod!

Cartman! 

Yeah. Do it, Cartman.

You can't leave! The show starts soon!

That's not what I meant by doing something about it, Cartman!

Ike's not my little brother anymore?

Why bad?

Tha- that's diarrhea.

GRRRRR!!

Wait we're working on it.

Oh my God, what if I'm not real?

You're telling me that every time you guys download an update for iTunes, you read the entire terms and conditions?

Oh, brother, here we go again. Cartman, there is not a sound frequency that makes people crap their pants!

I'm leaving right now! 

Well this sucks!

You?? Why?

C-Cartman?

Are you gonna burn me?

Well, Stan I have to harvest my crops before it's too late.

Hello, everybodyyy.

Hey, have you found Mr. Hat yet?

Look, it may not seem important now, but your vote really does count, and we all have to do our part.

Why?! So I could be sitting in the hospital waiting to die, like Stan?!

Hey!  Faith Hilling is not out of style, alright?

E-excuse me, my little brother needs medical attention.

Chinese radicals?

We were- trying to be funny.

Cartman! What kind of costume is that?

Kenny's not really my friend, Ma. I don't give a rat's ass about him.

Hello? Oh hey dude.

See where I am? It's this way. 

Wait till you guys see my costume! It's gonna be sweet!

I know, but, it's really snowy today.

McNuggets is scared. He doesn't wanna play.

Yeah, but now we think maybe heaven isn't a place you can get to, maybe heaven is just an idea. A frame of mind or, or something gay like that. Maybe heaven... is this moment, right now.

Whoa. What was that?

Dude, look who I found prowling around in my back yard.

What?

We can, too!

Ah.

Damn! I thought fourth grade was gonna be different.

I need to talk to you. 

I'm not inviting you to Casa Bonita.

We'll do it! We'll do it!

Wait a minute! I've got it! The bullriding contest. Cartman could ride a bull, and try to win $5000.  Think about it, dude: $5000. That's 1000 set of balls. That's 3000 balls! We'd have to win enough to get the dolls!

The water tank?   Hey I'm not going with you!

And this kid is watching Cartman commenting on people commenting on Dragon Age.

Ah!

We have to find a way to get the word out! People need to know pushers are being hired to take advantage of people with addiction problems! There has to be a way that we can get to the news company, and sneak in and somehow borrow their TV signal. If we could disguise ourselves as something ridiculous, then-

I want you guys to all meet my friend. 

Trent Boyett will do it. He's the toughest, baddest kid in preschool! 

I'll meet up with you guys in a little bit. I-I wanna hang out here some more.

Aw dude, weak.

Yeah! Timmy's probably back in third grade right now living it up!

It's what we do in Jew Scouts. Usually we just sit around and make stuff. But tonight, because there's a meteor shower, we're gonna do some big thing out in the woods. It's gonna suck ass, I'm sure.

Yeah. And then Craig's family came on and said Tweek was the wuss, and then punched Tweek's mom in the hooters.

Totally!

...Well, what does that mean?

Alright guys, listen up! This may sound a little strange, but, the whale, at the Denver Sea Park, is going to die, unless we get it to the moon,

Fart, damn you!

Well, we'd better get working. Cartman, you go home and call all the pet stores in the phone book.

Aah! There's another one!

I found it! I found it!

Turd Sandwich isn't better than Giant Douche.

Oh no...

Got what?

If we as a people choose not to believe that Jesus is the Son of God, then we can still apologize for the brutal way in which he was killed, and take our share of the responsibility for it.

Wahahahah!

Dude! He got a lawyer?

Paladin!

I am not full of meecro- what? Look, the word "shit" first showed up in English in the 1340s, the same time as something called, "The Black Death".

I'll give you ten bucks to eat it.

Yeah. And I can still get my A!

That if he could prove leprechauns exist, I would suck his balls.

God dammit, Cartman! You can't keep making up new powers!

But we found a frozen ice man from the past! 

Sssss-so ...Bebe ...didn't become smart and cool? It was just her boobs?

You hear that Clyde?

You guys don't even make a six-layer burrito!

Steve, you don't have to freeze yourself. Look!

If it needs to be seen by everybody, then why don't you put it out on the Internet for free?!  Well?!

We can't just leave!

Oh my God, this is great!

Well there's nothing you can do, so you just have to be patient.

No way! Tweek's cool!

No, this is his brother.

Yes. His flowing melodies are really enjoyable to us.

What??

Peter Rabbit.

That poor kid.

I don't know.

Yes. There's a Russian guy named Vladimir Stolfsky who's got search engine hits all over this thing.

We're sorry.

Gosh, I hope he doesn't cut me with his celery hand. 

Is that true?

Hmm... This isn't going over so well.

Yeah, real life is so boring and stupid.

Yup. 

From public school, your house is just a flicker of light.  Don't you want to go out? All you do is... stay in your house and... study

He might be right, dude.

You bastards!

Yep.

Dude, what are you doing?!

We went to a bunch of rock stars and sold them candy bars to raise the money you needed.

Ike, I'm sorry, but I couldn't get us out of school Friday. I can't take you to Yo Gabba Gabba Live.

Could I please one of your piping-hot farts in my mouth?

Yeah. But I have to say, I feel a lot better now.

I bet you don't win.
They don't let big fat asses
perform on TV.

Shut the fuck up!  What?

You are not going to go on national television and spew a bunch of hate speech about Jewish people! I won't let you do it, Cartman!

Yes.

Well, why did you pull it out of the trash?

So then don't have a slumber party if you're gonna be an asshole all night!

Thanks, kid.

God job, Butters.

You bastards!

Cartman, it was actually really lame.

But how are we gonna get the balls put on Butters' chin?

Huh? Well we don't really have that much money.

But nobody wants a Wall-Mart here!

Yyeeaahh.

Hrrgh! 

Four dollars?

Did you eat too many pork rinds last night? 

Stan, this is it. Time to stop feeling sorry for yourself and come home! Everyone cares about you and everyone wants you back!

Hey, look, there's Wendy Testaburger.

You bastard! 

Those contorting Romanian chicks rule.

That was cool!

Mom!

Grandma??

Dude, you can't do this! How can we be the Avengers without Captain America?

Dude, your family died?

Oh, you are so full of crap, Cartman! Metal spikes will not come out!

Dude, bail?

They're out fishing with Kenny.

What's this about, Cartman? 

Officer Barbrady, I wanna declare Shenanigans on this carnival operator.

All right!!

You aren't gonna cut off his wee wee. Not today, you sick-ass weirdo!

What the hell is that??

Got it. 

Cartman, you are hereby declared a full-fledged retard!

No.

Wow, I didn't know golf games were this cool.

Can you imagine it, Stan. A mind, emptied by that... thing.

Stan! Dude, is that you?

Ah... Oh Butters,  it'll be all right. Listen, we've all learned that people look for meaning in books. And sometimes, even if it isn't there, they'll try and invent their own meaning.

What?

Crap. 

Dude, I can't believe they fell for it!

Uhhh, we aren't cops or anything.

What the hell is wrong with you, Cartman? Haven't you noticed the three feet of snow on the ground?

Hey, that might work. But it can't be a party for us.

So get off your fucking scooters and pick them up!

No!

Me too. It was sweet.

Alright, alright, let's get this over with so we can put her back!

Okay, Stan, you've been an asshole to me all week! What is up?!

You gotta be kidding me!

Gods and clods?

I forgot all about him. 

Aw, God-dammit!

Go on and go home, you fat chicken!

Dude! He's making ice cream. 

Hey yeah, I remember that.

To City Wok so we can make our money. God!

Oh. Sweet, dude. I don't think we have to do this stupid debate now.  Stan?

Set, set.  Damn it Cartman!

Yeah. I guess we gotta try to get into that club, too.

In your butts?

Look! 

I hate you, remember?  You wanna be partners, Jimmy?

It doesn't prove anything!

Whoa, dude!

He did not!

And that's why you got a cold?

Yeah. It's almost as big as Cartman's ass.

Some hadka fish, some gafagga...

No Ike! Shh!

No you don't, butthole! 

A knife.

Come on, hurry. I bet we can get to level 29! 

Your husband.  He wanted that pie badly, but he knew that he was not allowed to eat it yet.

Wow, then you should get money for it!

Then, you'll help us?

Cartman, don't!

Tweek and Craig are gonna fight.

That's what the sixth graders do behind the school at recess. They take way too much cough medicine because they say it makes them see things in their heads.

Please, Chef, if I don't get out of school and get my little brother back from the aliens, my parents are gonna disown me.

You said we have no idea that you're never let us hurt Wall-Mart!

Because some people think vaccinations can give you autism or Asperger's!

And then you said

She's not here!

Jimmy, exactly what part of the fishsticks joke did Cartman write?

I'm ba-ack!

Yes. Why?

Dude, we aren't going to kill you. 

"AAAAAAAH!" 

Grounded? For what?

Hey, how do we know if she's pregnant?

That was totally gross. She smelled like vitamins and pee.

I guess it... feels great. Thanks. 

Awwgh! Hey dude, we don't even have enough weight to move.

Yeah. 

Where is it coming from?

I think the other dog's the one that's confused.

Stan, the PS4 doesn't have the seamless transition between games, movies, and TV offered by XBox One.

Do you know what happened to me this morning, Stan? This morning... I woke up and felt a sharp pain in my ass. I felt down there and, and found this... big sore lump. On my ass, Stan. I couldn't even sit down, so... I, I had to tell my mother, which, which was humiliating. She took me to the doctor, which was more humiliating, a- a- nd he told me. I-I have a hemorrhoid. It's like an infected blood vessel on your ass. I'm nine years old, and I have a hemorrhoid, Stan. I have a hemorrhoid, and, Cartman has his own theme park.

Well why not? You want us to get AIDS?

You can do it, McNuggets! 

Look out!! 

There, what do you think?

Be sure to take me to the same hospital!

Get him, Frenchy!

Good thinking

It's Mr. Hankey! He hasn't shown up yet.

My laundry detergent?

City kids get to go to museums for field trips. We get cow farms.

And so they put us in these harnesses and helmets. I th-I think that's when we started realizing, "Oh wow, this is actually pretty dangerous."

I'm gonna!

Do you think they'll believe it?

You just push it on other people?!

Yeah, what if they had modified the Roman Coliseum every year? It would just be another big douchey stadium now.

Nope. We wanna show the world how healthy your food is. Our fat friend here is going to lose forty pounds eating at Shitty Wok.

What's that?

Yeah!

Yeah. But you know, I've learned something today. You see, the basis of all reasoning is the mind's awareness of itself. What we think, the external objects we perceive, are all like actors that come on and off stage. But our consciousness, the stage itself, is always present to us.

Yeah, and he was out sick yesterday too. Guys...  I think Kenny isn't here because he's at home cheesing.

Okay, that's fine.

Nothing, watching the election results.

Yeah, look what you're doing to this poor kid.

Ugh! 

We won't let it happen again, Mr. Mackey, m'kay? 

Well what are we supposed to do with it?

What?

Aw, just forget the whole thing then!

Nuh uh.

Yeah, you're still fat!

No.

Fine! 

We're not talented?

Yeah, that's Cave of the Winds. It's a tourist attraction.

They said that Chef works in one of these buildings 

Hoh boy.  Sick!  Aggghhh! Fucking sickening! 

Yeah, dude. Its Guitar Hero.

It's Stan! 

I'm sure we're gonna get word any minute that people have agreed to stop. 

Just stop it! That's enough! You aren't reading another sentence of your stupid story!

Chef, come on!

Don't call Mr. Blaine a gaywad! He's a brilliant man.

No they're not, stupid!

Look, Stan. When Kenny died I learned how important friends are. I'm not gonna lose another friend.

It's a boy! 

Dude, if my mom knew I was in here, I would be in super big trouble.

Hello, I'm Kyle's cousin Kyle.

He singing some new hit song.

Yeah, I think they already moved in. I saw moving vans in their driveway two days ago.

Where are you going?  Ike, where are you going?

No, Mom-uh, he, he doesn't want you kissing him. 

You are the fucking History Channel!

Wait a sec. Where is your producer?

Cartman? Your side won, dude. Why are you so sad?

What's going on?

No. You're thinking of somebody else.

Two years?

Jesus Christ! 

Good.

NO!

Come on you guys, we need to figure out how to get out of school so we can get my little brother back.

Ladies and gentlemen, we have an epidemic in our country. Obesity is costing taxpayers millions, and some are taking advantage of a system that is flawed. Over the past several days I have filmed such a case, and the shocking video has been edited by my partner, Token. It is our hope that this film will cast light on a serious issue. 

Oh, she would, dude. She would. 

I need $17 so we can win Terrance and Phillip dolls.

It is stupid and immature! So you got people to crap out of their mouths! What do you want, a feakin' medal?!

That's the NFL!

Oh no! No, Ike! You are not watching him comment on things!

All the cruel jokes and ridicule will finally be over! Are you happy now, God?! YOU made me look like this!

Okay, Mr. Hankey!

Alright, fine! Let's just get this stupid report over with!

Bad.

Why?

Four tickets to The Lion King on stage!

Pretty good, I guess.

Yeah.

Aaahh. Well-  AAAAH! 

Cool! Now let's try the script!

Get out of my way or I'll kick your ass!

Ex, excuse me?  My name is... Brad. And uh I need to report a crime. Anonymously.

Look, we already have the guy's blog. Maybe we can find an address and check it out on MapQuest.

Yeah, so?

No, dude, if something happens to him, my parents are gonna blame me.

So... what do you do for fun?

Kenny!

You'd better be right, dude.

I just had a couple more questions about-

Stop who?

I'm sorry.  I I'm sorry, I can't do this.  I'm not doing this. 

Excuse me, sir? I think I know who did this. We saw this guy at the last crime scene, and, and you know how serial killers sometimes return to the scene of the crime? Well, I followed this guy to his house, and when he left again, I collected some fingerprints and did a blood-sample analysis.  I'm pretty sure he's your man.

If you knew something, but, you couldn't tell anyone, what... what would you do?

(Vanilla paste! Vanilla paste!)

He's gone, dude! Butters says he saw him leave.

Cartman! Cartman, wake up! Cartman!

Neat, huh Kenny?

No, dude, you're supposed to put their hand in warm water and it makes them pee.

Ike!

Terrible.

Nobody's blood is going to jump up in the air!

Calm down, Tweek. There has to be a rational explanation.

Hunh, I guess you're right.

They kind of look like us.  I mean, Stan's got blue eyes and I've got a sharper nose, but I mean, they kinda look like us.

I don't get it either.

I'm not done yet.

Hello?

Wait a minute, that thing landed on Kenny, and they took him to the mortuary.

If everyone is turned into zombies...

I swear

We got the money, Mr. Hankey. We're gonna make our animated Christmas card.

We just wanna go home.

Grab him! 

Charlie's right! I'm not gonna let some fake Mr. Hankey spoil my holidays.

Yeah, that sucked.

Buy me out?! What are you saying?! What makes you so high and mighty you can buy me out?!

He was with us at dinner. Wait. Was he with us at dinner?

No, dude!

Huh?

You don't understand what my mom will do to me if she finds out I was playing with weapons!

Really?

It’s the same goddamn song!

He just had to shuffle it.

I can't. My dad grounded me. Wait a minute, where is my dad?

Yeah. And we're sorry for turning Ned into a vegetable.

Okay, I got a text of the Russian guy's podcast. It's all a bunch of links to eBay.

Just give me 30 minutes. Come on, Ike! 

Oh. Okay. Thanks.

Ready to go Stan?

Okay.  N-no, ah I don't want that much responsibility. Here, you hold on to it, Kenny. 

Oo bastards! 

Hello.

Chef, I don't feel very metrosexual.

Well. Dude, it's uh it's good to have you back.

Who?

Yeah. Ready, Cartman?

What?

This is serious. They've been going out for almost two weeks now.

This is the worst day of my life.

We can't. Kenny just checked. There's a wall of people like seven miles thick behind us.

Why? Why, Mom? Because if I do something bad will happen to me? Because if I do your God might not shower me with his blessings of infected hemorrhoids?

They got us a truck, and an airplane, and Mr. Worf! The calves are gonna be okay!

Dude, leave me alone.

How much do we have left, Cartman?  How much do we have left, Cartman?!

Blew a funny fuse?

Come on, Ike! I promise I'll be nice to you from now on!

Nobody hates rainbows.

Dad? Are you sure there's time?

Cartman, what is going on out there?! What happened to Stan?!

We saw it on your channel.

What??

I've been thinking, Wendy. This whole outcome is pretty strange.

Yyeah well, I-I'm sorry I didn't trust you either.

How?

What happened? Aren't you still wallowing in pain?

Yeah. Did you make out with him, too?

Oh shit! Don't let him swallow it! 

You bastards!

Are there any questions?  Yes, Mr. Garrison?

Cartman, will you stop this gayness?!

Well, I don't know...  and I'll bet Cartman doesn't know either!

Remember, Tweek: punch hard, punch low.

'K.  She says she's been wantin' to break up for a while, and it's nothing against you.

Zipline. 

They're saying something about taking over the entire country.

Yeah.

Dr. Biber said he can give me a negroplasty so I can finally look the way I've always wanted. He even took my picture and then did computer imaging to show what I would look like after the surgery. 

Anything that'll impress us, Token.

For what?

Ike, please. I know your first love seems like the only love, but trust me, it's not. You have so much life ahead of you. 

Yeah, good idea. 

Aww gee, that's... so sad. Everyone should have one Facebook friend.

Finally!

One please.

There doesn't have to be...

We're with you, Stan.

Okay, that's enough.  Everybody! Cartman is just pulling one of his stupid tricks on everyone, because he's trying to get out of a deal he made!

Fuck you! Why would they send you in to convince me of anything?!

Kick the baby. 

Yeah, but Cyborg Bill is totally gay now. Please Mom? Everybody else has Chinpokomon.

Cartman! 

And Cartman for being a sadistic asshole

You were right. You were right all along. I thought you were just an asshole when you ripped on Jews, but... I didn't know, I... I didn't know.

So? You're a smartass!

Cool!

I said I'm sorry, you piece of sh- 

You're not supposed to rock, you're supposed to keep the beat!

He just stacked his Shapeshifter with an Elven Blade!

Comments on commentators, it's all changing so fast.Playing XBox with your brother is... just a thing of the past.
Now with Ma on her iPad, and Dad trending or trying,All the family is scattered, and the living room's dying.
Because it wasn't the outdoors or church or even trips to go ski,
What brought families together most was a good old TV
Now we watch things by ourselves and just tweet what we saw.
And if you try to complain, you get called a-

Don't worry about it.

And that makes sense to you?

Yeah. Too bad you're such a dumbass in history, or you would have known that!

Then take that shit off speaker phone!!

I don't know.

Didn't you hear? They outlawed fireworks 'cause a little boy blew off his hands.

Aw, stop it, Cartman! Your hand hand doesn't need to breathe!

Nuh, you've gotta sound fatter.

That quest sucks, Cartman! Think of another one!

I left my wife today. Walked out of the apartment without saying a word. I ran away from my responsibilities... just like I always do.  And I, again, am alone. 

There's four white birds!  This is what Grandma wants? She wants me to attend Jewleeard.

Eewww! 

Oh, God.  Wuh. Aah. Get out of here!

Jesus, it's freezing out here. He, he could be dead.

Cartman, I'm going to tell you something, and I need you to believe me, even if it seems impossible.

Elder, It's not my fault. He told me he was Jewish.

What are all you guys doing here?

Cartman is NOT Kenny's BFF!

That's only a vaccination for girls, stupid!

It's a really dry cold; that's the problem. It- the cold air makes me wheeze.

They picked up my hash tag, Stan! I'm trending!

All you ever do is talk about your balls!

Yeah, we wrote that!

Dah.  Does that mean you'll go to the dance?

It isn't that funny, Cartman.

It's perfect! I could take her to a basketball game.  Man I I don't know what's happenin', but... it seems like all the girls are... kind of into me lately. 

No, Cartman, I have no idea what you're talking about!

Did it work?

What does that have to do with Passover?

You know, I heard our fourth-grade teacher is some new lady from Denver.

I am nothing, and everything.

He's half man and half bearpig

Somebody took my dead grandma.

I could watch this for days. 

Good.

Shhh, you're doing it again!

Nuh uh.

Oh! Hey Cartman. We're playing dreidel; you wanna try?

No, really. We've always thought you suck.

Don't try and stop me, Stan! You don't know how it feels to be a deformed monstrosity!

Who's Middle Park?

Maybe you should go talk to the counselor.

Yeah! So you gotta bust out of here.  So we made you this cake.  There's a ailnay ilefay inside of it.

I think... I know what's wrong.

Damn it! Come on! I'll try to get more money from my mom. 

Holy crap, dude!  Hey look! He's got ice cream! 

It's great to have you back Chef!

Just, you know, make some money off him. Like Honey Boo boo.

Aw, don't be such a baby!  You do it, Kenny.

Yeah. We're guys, dude. We find something about all our friends to rip on. We made fun of you for being rich just like we make fun of Butters for being wimpy.

I-I don't know.

No! Maybe we all just need a little image change, you know? Like a makeover.

I have no idea!

HAHAHAA! Now I shall rule the --  Aww. Uuugh. God it burns! AAAH! My soul is on fire! Whoa! Oh, I don't like this!  I didn't know it would feel so... dark and evil!

No! No, I'm not going to Peru! Not Peru! 

Mexico here we come! 

Uh, I must have the wrong number. We were trying to reach City Airlines.

I've tried talking to him, but he doesn't want the lawsuits to stop. He's making too much money.

Nah, I can't. We should help look for him.

I don't need to. It wouldn't work.

What are you doing?

He beat us. Because all this time we've been so caught up with how to protect our music that we forgot to just play.

Stop saying "hella," Cartman!

What am I supposed to do?

Forget it! They can't hear us!

Cartman farted in there! We had to breath it in for 20 hours!

Twenty-five cents? Well that's not even worth it.

We're trapped in here!

Thanks for saving us Stan. You're my Super Best Friend.

Love, for one thing.

Know what?

No way.

Give him your food stamps, Kenny!

Come on, everybody. I think Kenny wants to be left alone. 

What are you doing? 

What's that?

What's this all about, Kenny?

What uh, what are you supposed to be?

Jews are tough!

So now I should stop liking Chinpokoman because you all don't?

Mr. Garrison won't let us out of school. He thinks we're making it up.

We're here for Towelie, fatass!

You sleep with money. Every night?

There's a big wait to sit down.

We're not fucking you, they're fucking Stan's grandpa!

And asshole.

Are we the only ones here who are completely confused?

Oh, my God! What the hell is that thing?! 

Calm down, Tweek. Fifteen might be enough.

Okay, hang on a second I-

Hey look!  It's working.

We... came to learn the facts about people with red hair, light skin and freckles.

All right, here we go.  Since the days of Copernicus, man has dreamed of flight. On this historic day we remem- aw, screw it! 

What? Why?

This isn't a joke, Cartman! You have to believe me, officer. The outcome of the election depends on it.

Ju-just have a little compassion, huh? I mean, everyone's gone out and bought something stupid. It's not so bad. Whichever of you guys has never bought anything frivolous, go ahead and huck the next squirrel. 

You're not the teacher, fatass.

Hike!

We saved the school!

You insensitive asshole, Cartman! Nine people died!

Oooohh, I see. Gods and clods!

Wouldn't it be better to just agree with him and forget the whole thing?

No, that's a hair dryer!

Nonono, we're not going into one of those cheesy places, Cartman!

Stop kissing ass, Cartman!

Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,

No, Cartman, we're going in there and splicing Fluffy and my elephant together.

You wanna go to Nebraska, Ike?

Chop off his wee wee?! Are you sure?!

Hi. My name's Kyle. Uh, I understand that your country flies people into space for money.

Noo, I'll just... be... going back to bed now.

Hey! What the hell are you doing inside my little brother?!

You were?

And it actually helps the crack babies. It's like volunteering but, but we just make a little on the side.

God damn it!

Cartman! You saved us! 

Yeah. This does seem really familiar.

What? No, I'm sick. 

Yeah, it's Ms. Choksondik alright.

Dude.

You think you own the entertainment business, but you don't! Give us back Wing, RIGHT NOW! 

You got my note?

Don't try and stop me, Stan! This is what my grandma wants!

Okay.

I'm sorry, can I come back in just a little bit?

Meh? Ike, we have a whole day to play XBox! Mom and Dad are leaving!

Yeah. I feel great!

Really? 

...so no KFC?

What's that? 

Dude, don't call my brother a dildo!

Well, he screwed us by makin' something up; I say we do the same thing.

And Cartman for being stupid.

Let's just get this over with, Cartman. You won the bet, here's ten dollars.

And we think that that is  a savage hypocrisy, because all crimes are hate crimes. If a man beats another man because that man was sleeping with his wife, is that not a hate crime?

Yeah, all you have to do is fart some more, Cartman! And the visitors are sure to come!

All right, fine, Cartman! You really want me to go in there, I'll...  Dude, Cartman, what is that behind you?

Ike! You are no longer to watch that stupid little YouTube blogging asshole! Do you understand?! You damn kids following these YouTube commentators is bad enough, but i will not have them invading my living room!

I don't know, I...

Huh. Whaaa?  Where are we? 

Oh, awesome.

What?

I don't know, I-I just thought if we all drank the Mountain Dew, the caffeine and the sugar would help us stay awake. I told Cartman he has to share it.

Jesus Christ!

Mom! Dad! Am I gong to hell?

Anything in the basement, Jimmy?

I mean, yeyou people are all just such hick jock rednecks; it's just like you right out of a stereotyped catalog.  Ah I can't take it. See ya. 

You sit- 

They want twenty million dollars.

Hey Ike.

Oh my God! 

Steve! Steve, look out!

Cartman? Cartman?!

Scott Tenorman? The ninth grader?

We do?

Yeah, try to have everyone make peace so it doesn't seem like a big deal.

Yes you can!

He'll show.

Dude, what's happening?

Yeah, it's cool.

Aaaaa!

Yeah. See, we got you to fight just 'cause we wanted to see who was the toughest. We made up all that stuff we said to get you guys mad at each other. 

Yeah! Go Stan!

Uhuh.

What the hell is wrong with these people?!

Dude, what the hell is going on?!

Not yet.

Oh crap! 

Cartman!

Are you Elton John?

You suck!

So... the Vatican took Stan's dad?

'Cause, we're his friends.

The Tale of... 

Nono Dad, please. I just got Call Of Duty: Advanced Warfare. Me and Ike are going to play it together.

But who paid for all this? 

How could we know she would... Aw we suck so hard.

Dude, our town is going to be better without the-  What the?

Yeah, right.

We wish- 

Go ahead and tell him, Cartman.

......Dude.

It's dying. The living room is... dying.

Look, can you guys just get down to business so we can go find my little brother?

What are we supposed to do with him?

Mr. Hankey?

I don't know what the hell to do. The whole world's gone crazy.

You guys!  You gotta help me. These business casual G-men are trying to kidnap me!

Alright, we'll take him. How much?

Relax, fatass.

Aw God, I'm so borrred. 

Go help him, Kenny!

I think so.

Yeah. He doesn't even know that the South loses the Civil War.

That's Moses, stupid! 

Know what, Ma?

What? 

Stop it, Cartman!

Uh, sir, d'I have a lot of homework to do tonight and I was-

We all have Attention Deficit Disorder. So we all started taking Ritalin.

Hey Stan, did you see that rainbow this morning?

Oh God, here we go again! 9/11 was not a conspiracy, fatass!

How many iPod Nanos is friendship worth? I guess, one.

Whoa, Cartman. We aren't gonna be hippies anymore. Y-you don't have to kill us.

Down by the fire?

You don't get sucked into it! You don't get sucked in at all! Plehehehehehehehese!

Kenny! 

I didn't feel comfortable in that stuff, dude. I'm just being me.

But my parents are gonna cut off his ding-dong!

Shut up!

If it'll make you leave me alone, then just take the damned thing! Here!  There. Now, get out of my house! And I hope you feel really, really good about yourself!

D-hude, this is gonna be so killer. They're all gonna get herpes!

Here's our cell phone, dude.  Will you call the police for us? 

What's in it for us?

Oh my God! They cloned a foot. 

Tell everyone you made the cow look like that!

Hi. We were wondering why fatass  I mean, Cartman, hasn't been showing up for school.

He'd be better used as a coat rack. 

Then why the hell do they call it "veal"??

Well, I mean, you didn't just start at 40, didja? You you gotta low-ball these things so you have a place to go.

Shut up and study!

What?? Who cancelled us?

Hey, wait a minute.  Is it possible that...

He does not!

Dad, let's just go!

Yeah, what's this about? We should be writing our monologues for Smackdown.

Look, Stan, I'm finally whole! My dad is even gonna take me back down to the all-star game to see if I can try out for the team again!

I don't know.  Let me go check. 

What?

Excuse me? Could we get through here?

Uh Butters didn't show. You wanna go to Casa Bonita with us?

It's okay, Ike, you're going to be... okay.

No.  No, I want to have the Antichrist inside me!

What are you gonna do?

When is Mr. Hat coming back?

THIS is the reason why our living rooms are dying!

This is ridiculous! Just because they say it on TV it's alright.

Whoa, what the?

We don't know who else to talk to.

Dude, it's been to long. Something's wrong.

Do you guys know anything about corporations?

You can say that again.

So you intended for us to go ziplining all along? Why, Stan?!

I got it mail ordered from Africa.  The ad said it would take 4 to 6 weeks, but it only took three.

Yeah.

What's it mean?! What's it mean?!

You guys, maybe we should come clean right now and tell everyone that it wasn't the tobacco companies that made us want to smoke.

Yeah! Fragile my ass!

Um... so...  So dual citizenship, wow, uh... You know that I, I never knew anyone that had that.

Hang on, Willzy-x. Hang on, buddy.

Dude, they're gonna look so stupid.

No way, dude!

I'm sorry, but right now I'm feeling-

Where is Cartman? He said he was gonna bring money for us to buy a pumpkin.

Now, don't go saying that. There's always hope. Miracles happen most every day.
To people like you, and me.
But don't expect a miracle.
Unless you help make it to be.
You hope, and I'll hurry.
You pray, and I'll plan
We'll do what's necessary, 'cause
Even a miracle needs a hand!

Well, it isn't a guy teacher. It's a woman.

..Oh.

Cartman, where are you going??

Dude! Do not do this!

(Yes. Yes, hurry up.) 

Yeah! You got served!

Oh, uh, wawawhat is this?

Jambu! Jambu, why didn't you speak up before?

You're such a fatass, Cartman.

No! What we really should do is go to our parents right now and take responsibility for smoking ourselves. Even if it means getting grounded.

Oh crap!

All right! MapQuest the address!

Well, I've gotta go start our animation. We've only got two days. 

All right, I really don't want to have to do this, but... I'm not happy with the direction this company is taking.

Yeah. We'll be the "Save Films From Their Own Directors" club

Eh... hey, Cartman?  You really don't care that you can't go?

I don't know what we're going to do? It's been like four hours and people still won't talk to us.

You are gonna tell everyone that you lied and that we aren't a couple!

He just... He just... stopped breathing. And it was over.

You're going home, Willzy-x! 

Scott Tenorman is an eighth grader who sold Cartman his pubes for ten dollars, and now Cartman's all pissed off.

Huh?

Yes, Mr. Garrison, I have to go now.

Oh God! Look, I know you got Asperger's from the school and I I'm sorry. But your negativity is poison to me!

Aw,  Jesus Christ!

That's it.  I'm going to combine my elephant with a pot-bellied pig and make…pot-bellied elephants.  They'd be smart like elephants, but small like pigs.

But that sucks. I don't want something to have that much power over me.

You don't wanna go back to stinky Romania, do you? It sucks there.

Aw, Cartman! You're supposed to bury it!

No.

M-Ah, I'd love to.

Dude, what the hell has gotten into Cartman??

Dude, I'm telling you. It's crazy. All my little brother wants to do is sit on YouTube watching this PewDiePie play video games. I swear, I don't understand kids these days.

Guys! You guys!  Listen: Cartman has tens of thousands of voter ballots hidden somewhere. He's changed the outcome of the election!

No... No, this isn't possible.

Yeah, they want everyone to stick around and watch more of this retarded show.

Satisfied with-  Wait a minute. What medication?!

Dude! Just 'cause some stupid North Park kid blew his hands off, we don't get to buy M-80s?

'K, so then get on Facebook and fertilize my crops?

That can't be. My parents wouldn't lie to me.

Dude, we have to try!

Hey you guys! You guys are not gonna believe this!

Butters, do you really think it's fair to lie like this?! Let me tell you, if you don't have the-

Anyway, that will give me plenty of time playing video games.

When is Mr. Hat coming back?

Well, all I can say is, he's better have Nintendo.  Well, here's Kenny's house.

Hey Stan, we're gonna go to the movies.

I'm not doing it, fatass!

Yeah. My Grandma.  She's here?

I am so confused.

Will somebody shut him up?

Yeah. I've changed mine three times already 'cause it itches so much.

Yeah, now what are we supposed to do?

Cartman, you fucking hunk of fat, rat-fucking hunk of pig-fucking ass fat.

Welcome to the team, Token.

Hey!

What are you doing with cats in your attic, fatass?!

Aw, man.  I don't feel so good.

We thought you were meeting us at Cartman's. What are you doing here, Taylor Swifting?

Butters! We said you can't watch it! We have a quest!

Really?

We need him to win a bullriding contest so we can get Terrance and Phillip dolls. Can he still do it?

Change our name?

Hey Cartman.

It's super awesome.

Cartman! I need to tell you something!

Remember the time when we got an elephant to make love to a pig?

I don't know. Let's go see. 

Well, he is. It turns out that the bookmobile driver here was the one making love to chickens.

There were no good times! And if he really feels bad he can just tell me himself!

Dude!

Dude! Where have you been? I've been waiting all afternoon.

Somebody's breaking into that Kum & Go.

Fine! We'll do it with out you!

Well, I... kind of gave a homeless guy twenty dollars last night.

Ask her if we get the watch right away.

I told you Cartman, I'm not one of them! I don't wanna live in West Jersey any more than you do!

Hey, you scrawny-eyed shithead, what the fuck is wrong with you?! You must be some kind of fucking asshole to be able to ignore a crying child!

Kenny! 

Hey, Kenny. How much for you to eat this?

Ahahah!

Yeah. We're fine.

You're freaking sellouts!

Mr. Garrison, seriously, I have to go. Can I please be excused from class?

Because I-  I... Um... because I think... they are real. It's all real. Think about it. Haven't Luke Skywalker and Santa Claus affected your lives more than most real people in this room? I mean, whether Jesus is real or not, he... he's had a bigger impact on the world than any of us have. And the same could be said of Bugs Bunny and, a-and Superman and Harry Potter. They've changed my life, changed the way I act on the Earth. Doesn't that make them kind of "real." They might be imaginary, but, but they're more important than most of us here. And they're all gonna be around long after we're dead. So in a way, those things are more realer than any of us. 

AAAHHH! 

Hey guys!

But I thought you hate us.

Yeah.

Please, I need to talk to the people inside. They can't set off that nuke.

Would you guys stop!

Oh.

Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?! They're identical!

Well, Ike. You can tell Cartman that it's my triangle!

It sure is. Do you want me to watch it with you, Ike?

NO! Hybrid cars are a good thing!

Hey, who are you?

Dude, shut your fuckin' mouth!

You mean this one?

Nooohohohohohoho-

You cheated, Cartman!

Hurray!

Get up! You have to fight! 

Hi Mom, Hi Dad!

What are we gonna do, Stan? It's, it's not like we can change the way an entire country thinks. I don't like it, but it's just the way they are.

NO!

Mr. Garrison, since haiku sucks so much ass, could we go to the planetarium again?

Hey Stan, Ah- I'm open, I think.

Hey McNuggets. You wanna come play for us?

Aww. Well Cartman, you can change things about yourself.

The new girl liked me, and so you lied to her!

Come on! Everything's gonna be okay!  Sir! Sir!

Kenny'll believe whatever you want him to.

You didn't see a leprechaun, fatass! If you could prove it, I had to suck your balls, but if you couldn't, you had to pay me ten dollars! Pay up!

Bye-bye seeme mama.  Ah, I'm gonna take him up to the bathroom to get washed up. 

Dude, we shouldn't be here!

Yeah. But there was so much of it. I was up until two in the morning.

I guess not.

"You know he can't think on his own, Kyle!" "Brush and floss, Kyle!" "Where has that finger been, Kyle?"

Mr. Jefferson!

You found Cartman like this and you think he's somehow trapped in virtual reality?

Kenny didn't have the head lice, all right?!  It was me.

Lame

Shut up, Cartman!

We told him to grow up. So he got rid of his stuffed animals.

I don't think Ike wants to go to Squirts.

Oh, God-damnit! That's your plan?

I came here to talk about you!

So what?!

Oh, Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay.

You're all I have left, Stan.

What are you talking about, fatass?

I don't know. Let's find out.

Damn it, he's still there.

That's bull-crap! TV shows are gay!

You bastards. 

Well, you are taking Chef from us. 

Well, it looks like she's not going to show up, Stan. Let's go look for the visitors now.

They saw us on the tour.  Dude, where do you keep going, Cartman?

That fat turd up there is the one who set up you and Token 'cause he thinks blacks belong together! 

Dude, that video is making people act strange.

What? 

You're right, Stan. My Grandma isn't floating around, judging me and watching what I do. She's dead. Dead and gone forever.

See? Look at this. Ike has all his friends over and they're just sitting around on their own computers barely talking to each other. Ike is watching PewDiePie play Dragon Age.

All right, mister! You better have a good explanation for why you didn't show up to play ball!

Yes, I did!

Whoa, dude. The road is really snowy out there.

Weak, dude. She only likes other lesbians?

I didn't wanna have to do this.  but if you don't tell us, I'm gonna tell your dad you helped get the wrong person elected President!

What?

Let's go. Oh my God, that smells good. 

Hey, why don't we watch some of those porno movie thingies?

Next please.  Oh, hey.

...Really??

I am picking up carbon-based life forms in Sector C. I believe we will find a village of peaceful aliens over that ridge. 

David Blaine is doing a big performance in Denver tomorrow night.  We're sure his magic will entertain and astound you!

Yes.

For reals? 

Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,

Come on Stan, don't you even know where you would go?

Kyle.

M'kay?

Oh no. Butters!

Come on, guys! 

You don't get it, Stan! I can play here all I want. I even get free Frescas. I don't need you anymore! 

Whoa, dude! Who the hell are you?!

Wow! I guess Cartman really did take care of them.

Not now, Cartman! I have really serious problems!

Dad? 

No! That's a stereotype.

What the hell did you do that for, Kenny?!

Fatass Cartman was
not on the school bus today.
What a big, fat turd.

You misled him, fatass!

You dumbass, Cartman!

Okay, it says here the operation begins with a one-inch incision in the ab-do-men on the left side just above the hip.

Hey, wait! 

Chef!

Aawwww! Hey Dad. Is it true that you and Kenny's dad used to be best friends when you were young?

I'm so happy! 

Son of a bitch! 

Well, that whole experience sure did suck.

I made you out of clay.

Sick, Kenny.

Mister, you can't do this to us!

Wait, Stan, there he goes.

Aw man, I don't think it's very safe to be on this bus.

Yeah, we're the Goonies, Cartman. Why don't you pretend like you're the fat kid?

That's... really touching.

What?

Okay. N-no, ah I don't want that much responsibility-bility. Here, you hold on to it, Kenny. 

I'm gonna go ask my mom! 

Cartman, I thought all you wanted was a Haibo doll!

Huh?

No more Barbra Streisand, everrrrr!

No! Ike, don't do it!

I just think I'd rather... control it instead of blame it on anything.

Uhhh...

But you're lying to people. If they knew that you didn't eat just all the sandwiches you want, you might not be so popular.

You're Stan.

We're totally screwed!  They took the two best judges away!

Who's Beth?

Uuuh. Well, the truth is, we didn't write that paper last time. 

Why would anybody send this asshole money? 

You have got to be kidding me!

Dude, you have to tell everyone. Right now.

We don't have kickoffs anymore. 

What?!

There. Do you really want that asshole to win?

But that doesn't mean it has to go off the air. You should like that show. Your sense of humor is just like Family Guy.

The Jewish population isn't dying out, fatass! It's growing!

We're already doing a paper on Tweek's underpants gnomes.

This is it, Stan!  It's just like I designed it. There's the miniature gold course over there! And slides and uh,  excuse me, what is this place?

Oh, I'm swell, Stan. I popped my hemorrhoid trying to climb the fence into Cartmanland, and it got infected. I really need to go to the bathroom, but if I do, it will pop again and the pain will make me pass out. How are you?

Dude, Ike isn't dead. He's in Nebraska! 

What's going on?

Dude, that was Star Trek again.

Yeah, well people should  know that peeing in pools is  bad!

Don't be sad, Ike. Just be happy that you live in a country where people get to elect a president at all.  Hello?

It's pulling us in! 

Hm, I wasn't really going for "gay," I was more going for "wholesome."

I'm going to see the Queer Eye For the Straight Guy people.

Peter Pan, too??

Yes?

Dude, that kicks ass!

The whale's name is Willzy-x, and he told us he's dying on our planet. We've come up wth a plan, but we're gonna need all of your help to make it work.

All right, all right!  Dude, what is the matter with you?

Did you guys hear that?! A hundred thousand dollars for a picture of Britney.

Cartman farted!

They are?

You've always been a dick to me, Cartman, and I'm not inviting you. 

Stupid supremacist asswipe!

Big corporations are good!

I'm a hundred percent ready, coach! 

The last commercial break is starting!

You could do Cartman's voice, can't you?

Oh well, I I grew up in the shity, ah ah I really don't care for it. Ah I come from a Jewish family, which of course you already know, because Kyle's from the same family.  I like to read, and I have these polyps on the backs of my hands - I don't know what they are.

...What? 

Stan, you can't keep doing this to yourself. You have to go live.

Excuse me, but Ike has homework he's supposed to be doing.

I'll do everything I can.

Yeah, but that sucks, to get your butt kicked by a girl, Stan.

You guys, we can't let him do this!

What?

Dude, he's farting fire!

But they said we can't charge the front door.

A hot tub?!

Don't worry, dude. You're gonna do great.

Broflovski looks for Kenny to get clear for the pass.

No, we'll stay here too. If we start wandering off, we're gonna get lost or killed. Let's just wait here and hope help comes soon.

Come on elephant, keep drinking.

It was my idea and we're gonna tell everyone to write in "Giant Douche!" It's way funnier!

Don't belittle my people, you fucking fatass! 

Come on, Chef! You can do it!

What? 

Well, it is kinda true, you know? Thanksgiving is fun and all, but the Native Americans got pretty screwed over.

Shh, Blanket, we're gonna take you away for a little while, okay? 

Photon rifle, whatever. 

Will you shut up!

It is?

At who?  Heh- hang on. 

Yeah!

That's not how a croc sounds, you fatass penis!

See, w-we're the official presidents of the Terrance and Phillip Fan Club. A- and... we're... going to see them tomorrow 'cause we can get them to perform at the Earth Day festival.

Why not?

Too eager to what?

Please don't cancel us. Please.

What?! 

I'm going to try to save Stan and Butters from getting nuked!

I don't speak Hebrew.

We don't have a fifth member, Cartman!

Can we please just try and talk to him?

Dude, you sneezed on my back!

The aliens are chasing us! 

Yes!

What?

Well Token was a definite winner for talent show. But then we decided to take everyone to a baseball game, to see how we got along there.

You did it, Mr. Hankey. You brought back the spirit of Christmas!

Yes.

But how can the Jews make it better??

You didn't think of anything, Butters! Guys have been doing what you're doing for years! You're nothin' but a common pimp! 

Well, at least he's back to normal.

Jesus, dude! 

Hello?

Who makes this crap?

I have to save my little brother! I have to send him away until my parents come to their senses!  Come on, Ike!  Cover me for a while. I'll find a place to hide him and come back.

...star-starting to become alienated from some of your friends.

I'm gonna kill you, Cartman!

Oh stop! We're not friends! He's the one who infected me with AIDS!

Dude, we have to get rid of our weapons so at least we can try to deny everything.

No, not at all. 

"Krocsyldiphic." C  Damnit!

What, doughboy?

That was sweet, Bebe.  Now, if you just hold the rock like this, you-

Ike, is that chewing tobacco?

Dude, no way! 

But, dude this doesn't make any sense. I mean, if you know it's going to make you crap blood, why wouldn't you at least just try eating less of it?

Huh?

No Ike! They're playing the trailer to the new Terrance & Phillip movie during the show, and we have to watch it! 

Wow, awesome. Um...

Mr. Garrison, can we talk to you?

But we promised the Earth Day people you'd perform.

Yep! I love basketball. I wanna play for the Denver Nuggets one day.

Whoa, dude!

How can they make a show out of this? I wasn't even agreeing with them. 

Yeah, that was pretty good. 

I'm not doing it either. Kenny?

Dude, no wonder terrorists come from places like this! If I grew up here, I'd be pissed off, too!

Okay, here's the one part that really makes no sense to me:  the first time you saw blood stains on your underwear, were you alarmed?

I am taking it personally because Cartman is a retard! Just because he hit his head and went into a coma doesn't mean he's a- Wait, that's it. If I want people to listen to me, I just have to be as stupid as Cartman.

Yeah, fat boy saw it!

Now do you believe us, Cartman?

The odds on a single number in roulette are thirty-five to one.  That means, with a ten thousand dollar bet, you win three hundred and fifty thousand.

Please Dad, I've been looking forward to this all week. Aaand it's me and Ike's bonding time. Really. This is good for our relationship.

This is awesome!

...What the hell are you talking about?!

Stan, I don't think we're supposed to be in the military base. They might shoot us.

Uh, alright then.  Oh, would you look at that? I've got a corn on my ankle.  Now where did that one come from? That's the fourth one I've had- 

It doesn't matter. Because God is going to harden the Pharaoh's heart!

Ohhh, no you don't. That isn't gonna work on me, Canadian!

Really? That's what you guys would do?

Why would they play such a cruel joke on us?

Wow. I think I owe you one, Cartman.

That does it! Shenanigans!  SHENANIGANS!

Cartman is trying to bring Christmas to Iraq.

So what should we do now? It's Saturday and we have to have as much fun as possible.

Ahhh I've seen this before. Whenever they try to distract a robot in the movies, they tell it some kind of paradox, to get its processors all tripped out.

All made up. Not real. Nothing's real.

Oh wait. Hey AWESOM-O,  I'd also like some celery sticks chopped up two inches long, with peanut butter and raisins on top.

He's a big guy, with a beard.

Oh, you are not doing that again!

Eh it's "Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow." I taped it last month.

Do any of you guys have milk money I can borrow?

All right, what do you guys wanna ride first?

Oh. Arrggh! 

I got it! I got my Chinpokomon game controller! 

Butters?

That sound perfectly reasonable.

I'm sorry.

Yeah. Yeah, that counts.

Ike?

You bastard!

Pot's illegal too, but people still manage to find it. Ever since that first time Kenny cheesed, he hasn't been the same. You've all noticed the change in him. I'll bet Kenny's at home cheesing right now.

Ah, look, Phillip. Everyone in South Park just wants to see your serious side.

Yeah, sweet.

You will?

We're trying to raise money for our school chef.

Uh, Chef?

But we will have to sleep, dude.

Wait. The U.S. Government has a portal to the imagination?

The government could come after us, Cartman.

Wow!

But dude, check out my new Trapper Keeper.  It has five different compartments for each subject in school,  and it's all covered with pictures from Dawson's Creek.

Ah, damn it! My little brother's trying to follow me to school again.

Her life belongs to us!

She's upstairs.

Yeah yeah.

Are you okay?

Dude, I figured it out.

Willzy-x, I think we're here.

What kind of protection?

Ike, don't do it! There's still so much to live for!  I know you really wanted McCain to win but, but it's going to be okay.  No, that's not true, Ike. The economy could easily stabilize with Obama's plan.  Ike, don't jump! You could really hurt your ankle or something.  Really Ike, that's like five feet off the ground. Don't do it.

Yeah, maybe you read it wrong.

Mom? Can Kenny go to Jewbilee with me?

I knew it! It wasn't because I gave that guy twenty dollars! The homeless all came from here!

Whoa, that was cool!

with dreidel I shall play.

Kenny? 

We told you, dude. 

Like you! Maybe you just need to let your hair down. And let's see how you look without those glasses.  Let's just... put those back on. 

Hey dudes. 

And then Craig was all like, "Tweek is scared o'me. He's a big chicken." And he started doing an impersonation of you being a chicken;  well, everybody in the world saw it!

We went through all that just for some gay video of Earth?

Ogh. Oh cool, she likes basketball? That's perfect! Thanks, you guys!

White Stripes

A giant douche.

I'm not getting back in the water.

Dude! That thing is huge!

It's good to have you back, Cartman.

Ha! Our bet was that you would get a platinum album, not a myrrh album! I don't owe you anything, fat boy!

Um, sir-

It's gotta be the Komfort Inn. It's the nicest hotel in South Park. Cartman, go get your camera.

You're too fat to be Kenny.

Yeah, he wanted adventure! Not a bunch of ridiculous bullcrap! Right Chef?  Chef?

In there? But it's very confined. I'll get cramps in my legs.

Doesn't anyone understand the significance of "I'm sorry" anymore?

"Free hat?"

He's not highly intelligent.

Yeah. And my powerful nunchakus make me into Bunroku , a deadly but compassionate ninja who protects those in trouble.

He must have a huge bone in his ass, then. 

I'm not a professor.

Cartman, don't be such a baby! We're supposed to be rugged outdoorsmen!

Hey, look! It's snowing! 

Sooo, what's phase 2?

Come on, Tweek! He's only got one arm!

Oh my God! Look at his leg!

Guys.  Guys, I need your help.

What should we do, dude? That big snake keeps growing; it's gonna demolish the whole state soon!

Whoa, look at that.

Don't let him touch you! You die if he touches you!

Dude, check it out. 

We just wanna warn you: Eric Cartman, the fourth grader, is goin' tuh try and trick you somehow into getting your wiener bitten off by a pony who lives at Denkins' ranch.

Why?! So that we can lose our business and everything can go back to old times?!

Cartman, just stay out of it.

...I hate you so much. 

Because we keep getting screwed over by your diarrhea!

Yeah. We have a report to do, asshole! Get up! Get up!! 

No!

We promised each other we would never do that, remember?

Yeah, they look like cheap rip-offs.

Can we talk to your supervisor please?!

Ike, I do! I just-

Yeah. Here you go. 

'K go! 

No way.

It will.

Cartman has HIV?

What if they don't show the Terrance & Phillip trailer at all? What if we went through all of this for nothing?

Dude, I thought she was dead.

No, I just don't think it's healthy.

Yeah, we know.

There! You see?! This is what happens when Cartman is allowed his right to free speech!

Dammit Cartman, don't you ever learn anything?! 

Mr-&#160;! Goddammit. Here, come on. We need to clean that up. 

Aahhh...

Wing?

He's up in, like, twenty minutes!

Well, how'd we do it last time??

Country Kitchen Buffet?

Well, I'm sure it was him.

Jambu! Jambu, I'm back!  How are you feeling?  Huhm. Jambu, you wanna talk about rocket ships?  Ja- Jambu? Are you still feelin' lonely here?

It wasn't like Faith Hilling was that great. I mean-

Towelie, over the past few months I have watched you go from an ancillary character with a few amusing catchphrases to a dried out spooge rag covered in the jizz of a thousand older men.

They told us that "Phillip. He's the one with talent. Just get him for Earth Day."

Oh, and what do you know about stem cells?!

What if this is all just somebody's dream?

What's a "quin-tuplet"?

Well, you have to hit it softer!

He's a magician named David Blaine, dude. He kicks ass.

Who are you?

Yeah, she's fatter than Cartman.

Oh Jesus! Now where do we go??

I wanted to get Ike out of his room, so I invited all his friends over for a slumber party to play Dragon Age: Inquisition.

Why do you care?

But what about the costume contest?!

What is that?

The base where you're from and where our Okama GameSphere is! 

There it is!  That must be of the antelope family.

For Odin! For Asgard!

So what now?

Ah- I was just sledding, and the next thing I knew my sled rope got tangled with a bus, uh. I gut dragged for over a hundred miles before the bus finally stopped for gas.  I'm sorry about your sled, Kyle.

Come on, Nurse Token. We're gonna play football, you puss.

You guys can't tell anybody, all right? Not until I figure out what to do.

Because anybody who thinks 9/11 was a conspiracy is a retard!

Yeah, why's your family so poor Kenny?

We can use Cartman's pig.

Let's Plays?

They said we have to give them money that we make on the Internet.

Yeah! Isn't this great?!

What do you mean?

Of course, the sewer! That must be where he is. Come on!  Come on!

We only have one option. I've gotta take you to the surface.

Don't you get it?! You can't have any Trapper Keepers, fat ass!

Oh thanks, dude.

What should we do with him?

Then you have to tell us!

He's not my brother!

What?! Are you serious?!

How can you say that? Did you see what we did to their house?! It'll take them days to clean that up!

Look everybody, I know we all feel our hands are tied, but the fact is, we can do something about this. There's an app which can actually allow kids to block things that their parents watch on television. And it is password-protected with a security code that only a child would know.

Ohh, right, you're supposed to pull and master-benate your wiener really fast.

I didn't "bail," I got picked up by the government!

No-no-no-no. Come on, fatass, we're gonna get 'em all back.

Oh, my God.  Hi, ...Grandma.

I swore to never fight again.

What is a meth lab, anyway?

Like what?

We feel bad for other people.

Wow, cool.

Go Cartman! 

NO, Cartman!

Because that's what real artists do. People are always gonna find a way to copy our music and swap it for free. If we're real musicians, then we should just play and be stoked that so many people are listening.

Alright. 

You put a guy's wiener in your mouth, that makes you gay, stupid!

So how do we stop it?

It wouldn't be funny if that Web site posted something about you!

Damnit! What the hell is wrong with you, Tweek?!

Damn it!

Oh no! It's that  super-sad Sarah McLachlan commercial! Look away!

Yeah. Maybe if we can get higher ratings by the end of the week, they'll let us stay on the air!

I can get a better deal?

It's all right. He can't kill us unless we agree to duel. 

...I am eight.

You guys, do you really care what a bunch of girls have to say about how you rank in looks?! 

I don't really care, dude.

No, I was taking a crap, and I heard you guys talking!

Because you kind of made it matter.

You see? Nothing, dude. Just a bunch of stars.

Yes they are! I have an idea.

You're afraid to do it, too.

No, I'm being totally serious. That is the best idea you've ever had. You should run away to Mogadishu. You should go there right away. I'll even help pay for your ticket.

Lucky. 

Did you hear that, dude? We still get $3000. That's enough for you to do your DNA test.

Wow, you know, Cartman? That is an awesome idea. You should totally go to Somalia.

Ike, I don't care if you wanna grow up, I just wanna be by your side while you do it.

What do you have to think about?

Dude!

All the time: "Look out for your little brother, Kyle!", "Take care of your little brother, Kyle", and he wasn't even really my little brother.

Yes! I can't help but take some credit for this. I helped convince him to go!

I can see its head!

Yeah. You used to sit in the living room with family and friends to hear their commentary on things. Now you can get it with a l-

Don't give him anything!

I know! But that doesn't matter any more! These kids don't wanna play the game, they just wanna watch people on YouTube play it. And you know why? Commentary.

See? I told you it would work. 

Dude, I don't think 8-year olds are supposed to take hormones.

Hey you guys! Look what I have!

What's going on?

Kenny's!

Don't do it, Officer Barbrady!

I made you out of clay.

Nah. Dude, I c-I can't go to have a birthday party while Butters is missing.

That's retarded! You didn't come up with that experiment, Cartman, you saw it in that movie, The Thing!

Oh, you can pretend all you want! You're not fooling anybody!

Aw man, at least the real Jesus didn't weigh 400 pounds!

Dude, don't kill your mom. That's not cool.

... Uh huh.

Sure. Remember that time that that kid in the red shirt decided to go off on his own?

Hey, Stan!

Oh, thank you! I was so eagerly awaiting your approval of my abilities! 

Yuh huh!

What's it say?

Good night.

Dude! Just take them off!

Look, up there.

Oh no, dental floss, what will I do?

Really?

Biggie. Smalls... Biggie Smalls...

This is totally what's happening!

No more boring baseball until next year!

They all laugh at me!  And the girls giggle behind my back!  unable to even glance at my disfigured face.

The skin's the best part...

Yeah! You get out of town!

Dude, it's got a hundred twenty eight gigahertz D-RAM.

Yeah! We thought of the whole thing!

The fatass. The mayor.

Yeah, you're from China.

Oh please, no reason! I got AIDS from him!

It was seriously about the greatest night of our lives.

Yeah, we made the whole thing up. It was all just a really, really funny joke! 

Thanks Butters

You know what you assholes like! You like to fuck! And shit! And fuck! And fuck! And fuck! And fuck!

Well, not really, except that Kenny keeps eating people's brains.

If some of us are on PS4s, but the rest of us are on XBox's, then we all can't play together online. See? This is all about committing to one machine.

Dude, look at Bebe.  Something seems different about her.

It was just thirty minutes of two women queefing on people!

After all that?! Shenanigans! Shenanigans! SHENANIGANS! 

No??

Yeah, you gotta know people.

...And in conclusion, the Latino community has provided America, and indeed, the entire world with innovations that we would be lost without. And that is my presentation on the role of Hispanics in American technology. Thank you. 

Your triangle?

Ike, I didn't tell on you, you got busted by the hallway monitor.  Okay, okay. I did have something to do with it. But someday you're gonna realize it was for the best.

Well ah I guess in wrestling we're supposed to make our own outfit, and then wear it over this.

Alright, Ms. Crabtree. Is it comf'table enough?

Red Robin can be rented out, for wedding parties. If we all chip in we can pay for the deposit to have the wedding party there.

You said you could get us money, Cartman!

On Wednesday or Thursday?

What are you talking about?

Well, let's just try to finish all this coffee, so we can stay up.

Ah, dude, weak.

Kenny? Kenny?!

Go ahead. We don't wanna be in their stupid commercial.

Mom?

Yeah. So what's the first syllable?

Yeah! We've gotta raise people's awareness!

Uh oh, they're closing!

No! I don't wanna look like this!

From who? We can't ask adults for help and there's nobody tougher than sixth graders.

Is it cold in here? I realize we're in the mountains, but do we have to freeze to death?

Wow! I had already forgotten how great third grade was.

How come you're not dead yet, Cartman?!

He said Madonna is an old anorexic whore who wore out her welcome years ago, and that now she suddenly speaks with a British accent and she thinks she can play guitar and she should go fuck herself. 

I promised my mom I'd let him try. 

What?

Oh, Jesus!! 

It's just wrong, that's all.

Funny.

Shut up, Cartman!

Dude, it's bad enough we have to sit here without you taking a crap every ten minutes!

Why would he put anything in your butts?

You bastards!

How can they let an eight-year-old decide Kenny's fate?

I'm sorry, Cartman. There's been a little change in plans!

How come you didn't buy any cards, Stan?

Butters has been missing for a week! You might have inadvertently gotten him killed!

Totally, dudes! I feel awesome!

The knights of Standards and Practices were created to make sure that bad words were kept to a minimum. "Curse words" They're called that because they are a curse. We have to go back to only using curse words in rare, extreme circumstances.

It's the holiday season, but the good times... are ending.Because what matters most isn't what's good, it's what's trending.
This younger generation, with their eyes and ears glued:
What's trending to them is trenders who trend on YouTube.

Oh c-come on, that can't be why they're all here. There has to be another reason.

Oh, we're just makin' a cradle out of an egg carton for our egg. We figure that way it'll be easier to keep safe so we can get an A.

HAAAAH!

Oh crap! 

...What are you doing here?!

All this for a bunch of stupid movies?

No, see? There's people of all colors. And they added a black guy as one of the hangers, too, so it's not racist.

I knew it! Don't let that fat turd walk all over you, Jimmy! Stand up for yourself!

Come in.  COME IN!! 

Who's they?

Dude, for the last time, don't call my brother a dildo!

We?

Uhuh, but that's why we're going.

What's going on, you guys?

God, I hate the holiday season! 

That looks awesome!

Nothing. But the guys said if I don't confess my sins and eat crackers, I'm gonna go to hell.

Aaaaa! There's a dude here! 

Maybe they took it literally when we said we wanted to adopt a kid.  Whoa! That was cool.

Yep, all done.

Look, we don't have a lot of time here, okay? Can you just tell us where the new Prime Minister is?

It looks like we're completely sealed in.

There is no cure, you asshole!

Hey! What about this guy?!

How many tickets can we put you down for?

Most likely.

Well...  Well, what do you want?

Aw, come on Dad, don't be such a Jew!

Cartman, do you even know what's going on? We went to Imaginationland, terrorists attacked it, and now the government is about to-

...Mr. Hankey! Hoh, we were so worried! I was waiting up for you and you didn't come, so I thought that-

What?

What?! You were waiting for me in the bathroom!

We can get everyone back into the Christmas spirit by making our very own animated Christmas special, and showing it to everybody in town! 

Yeah. She's really cool. 

Then saw off the arms and legs. 

-And I'll whittle.

Yes, I did!

The girls do not have a device that shows them the future Cartman. That's retarded.

Don't... do that!

...Huh?

Steve, wait!

Uh, it's okay. We know the owner.

Don't call my mom a bitch, Cartman!

Who confessed? That doesn't make any sense.

Will you stop it with that?! What part of this is funny to you?!

No, Ike! Ma, Ike keeps taking off his Squirt uniform!

What??

Now look! The reason we're in this situation is because people are being stupid! The economy isn't some vengeful being that takes things away from us. The economy is just made up of people, and people have just lost their faith in it.  What people really should be doing is spending more. Spending is fine. People should just go outside. People should just go outside. They should buy the things they need for their friends and family

You won't get more votes than us, asshole!

Just wait till everyone sees my sweet Chewbacca costume. They're gonna be so jealous... 

Cartman got his, then Kenny. What if tomorrow Stan says he got his and I'm left out? I might not even get to be their friend anymore.

Cartman, Cartman! I heard that Stan somehow found out about our plan!

Yeah, hey, do you think we'll get in trouble for watching it?

He's asleep. Wake up fatass!

Oh God, get me off of here!! 

Say something, Mr. Hankey! 

Hormones?

I just didn't think it would come so soon.

What are they doing?

You're such a fat baby!

STAN, WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE! 

Oh God!

Cool!

If you don't show Mohammad, then you've made a distinction what is okay to poke fun at, and what isn't. Either it's all okay, or none of it is.

Hey.

Yeah. 

Yeah. Boy, am I glad to see you, Ike.

Yeah, we got him!

Bye, Mr. Hankey. See you next year.

What?

Aw, come on, dude! All you've done for the last four days is mope around! You might as well hang out with those Goth kids who dress in black and talk about pain all the time!

Do you know what those kids are going to do to you?! A little middle-class white boy telling them what to do? They are going to fucking murder you! 

This is stupid!

We're, we're in trouble. We're in sooo much trouble.

Hello? This can't be right, I-  Ow!

Ike?

Thanks. 

Oh God... 

You do not have Tourette's Syndrome, fatass!

Come on, you Frenchy little frog!

Oh! Tha-oh, yeah, the the startup company thing didn't really work out.

Can I have three thousand dollars, Mom and Dad, huh?? Can I??

Nobody gives a crap about your Trapper Keeper, Cartman! 

Set an open course for the virgin sea...

No! Didn't you guys learn anything? Look, if we make an album, all that's gonna happen is that people are gonna steal our songs for free off the Internet. We won't make a dime!

What I understand is that you totally screwed me over!! So why should I have to listen to you?!

Will you shut the hell up?! 

Come on! We've gotta make another one! 

I'm not going back.

No way, dude!

Oh. Ike, Squirts is so much fun--

Oh no!

What are you doing, Cartman?

It's been a week since Ike's been gone, and every day my parents seem worse. I have to try to go to Canada and speak with the new Canadian Prime Minister, but I can't do it alone.

Judas Priest.  Wow! Downloading music for free is awesome! 

Huh? Who...? Who is that?

You better! 'Cause if you don't find a cure for HIV, I will break your Xbox!

Well, my dad is, too.

This is freaking me out, dude.

Sir! Mister television executive! Stop!

Get it back to normal, Chef!

I don't know.

I'm never speaking to either of you ever again! 

No, turdpants, it's Kyle!

God damn it Cartman!

Oh, Jesus. You told him that?! 

What does me being a Jew have to do with anything?!

Sorry Ms. Cartman, but your son took some things that didn't belong to him.

This isn't helping us, Butters!

Hohohooho! Oowwww!

Uh, a bear?

Cartman, he's got everyone on Sony's side. We can't stop him!

Original zombie? Well, how the hell do we know who the original zombie is?!

Ookie mouth!  Gross! I can't do it, Ma!

Light is a wave unless it's observed? That means all matter is just a wave.  Nothing's real! Reality in a nuh- Oh God, it's happening! 

Do you wanna bet?

with dreidel I shall play.

What's that?

Sorry, Marvin. We tried.

All I'm saying is that it's gonna take a lot of singing to make up for that!

Well, because you got good coordination, sharp reflexes, and you're fucking fat.

Yeah, I think so.

Mr. Hankey? Mr. Hankey, is that you? Hello?

Good point man.

How stupid do you think we are?! Now you die on that cross and get resurrurected before I kick your ass!

Dude, what does the note say?

Put him down, you stupid dog!

Yeah. I guess their rules did have a point. Things have gotten a lot worse in the ten days since they've been gone.

No. Then I came into this virtual space.

This game is fixed! The balls are bigger than Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth!

Jesus, dude. W-w-what happened? It's like, something's lowered the bar to the point that nobody feels any shame anymore.

Hey! Maybe you can come with me. Then it won't suck so hard.

I have been sick!

Stop wasting the tacos on your hand, Cartman!

Stan, I don't like Wendy.  All I cared about was getting an A in this stupid project!

Gross, Cartman. Whoopee!

Hyeh. Yeah. Mung isn't even a word! We made it up! 

Yeah, dude. I told you, we had bread sandwiches for breakfast.

What?!

Dude, what are we supposed to do? We always just play with fireworks.

What is this??

Well, you have to help him, just like I have to help my dad.

That dirty no-good sonofabitch!

Dude, who the hell is Mitch Connor?

The sea people from Cartman's side are suicide-bombing the buildings on Tweek's side.

How are you going to try to get invited to Casa Bonita this time?

You're on!

Dude, don't forget: Timmy is the only kid who can play Helen Keller. Don't piss him off.

What?

We can't let those sixth graders get their hands on this videotape.

It's just sending images of cities and people and stuff.

Oof. 

Yeah dude, nothing fun is free.

One please.

I think we ditched them.

What did we do?

...and now I have to go home without him and my parents are going to have me killed.

No, what marches in, crawls up your leg and bites the inside of your ass?

Stan, don't you think this has gone far enough? Is it really that big a deal?  Yeah, just vote. For Giant Douche.

Dude, I'm Jewish. I have no idea.

Gays, I guess.

Well, but, this is the jacket I always wear.

Ike!  Wait! '

Dude, it's Terrance & Phillip.

Yeah. The more distance between me and the others from Jersey, the better I feel.

Hell no! 

Whoa, look at that.

What Butters? 

Yeah, but you know? I think you've learned something today. You've learned that you can't rewrite history.  You see, history is forever,  and everything happens for a reason.  Sure, you can try and change the past, but usually you kno-

It's just that... I really need this A, Stan. And Bebe did say you almost broke your last egg.

Well I've been thinking: maybe there's something you've come into contact with that hinders HIV from growing. Do you mind if we just look around?

Dude, dressing up like Hitler is not badass!

Excuse me.  Hello?

AAAAAAA! 

Uh oh, we're losing him. 

Come on, Blanket. 

...No.

I know! That's so hilarious!

Because that sounds like we don't have anything, We've been through this already, Stan!

Wow, that was pretty good.

Whoever it might happen to be, I'm not giving him the opportunity. Tomorrow I'm going to do something. Something I've known I would have to do restore people's faith.

Hey, so... do you wanna be Facebook friends?

No dude. Because since you got your feelings so hurt for being ripped on, now we think you're a pussy.

You bastards! 

So then maybe you're wrong.

He's here! Vince McMahon is here! 

She's gonna kill us?

Rebecca, there's this dance, see, the South Park Elementary Bay Of Pigs Memorial Dance, and uh, now I was wondering, ih-ih-ih if you wanna go.

Because you just said, "here in my room"!

Have Butters kiss it.

You barely made it over one, fatass!

Until we get people to stop downloading music for free, I say we refuse to play!

...Nuh uh.

Wendy, I just wanna get an A, okay? Let's not make this any more confusing than it already is. &lt;&gt;

What?! 

Cool! Ziplining.

Yeah! You suck, Cartman! 

No, Cartman, we can't do it on Raymond again! It has to be on a current event in South Park. Tweek, do you have any ideas?

So is it a coincidence that Grandma DID talk to me about going to Jewleeard someday?

We don't wanna be gay bashers, Chef.

Dude, will you just end this thing now?! My little brother is gonna die!

Wait. Isn't there some rule about not getting into cars with strnagers?

Aw, dude, come on. I gotta do my science homework.

You know what? I'll bet it was you!

So what are you doing?!

Okay, where are the E-mouths?

Goddammit! God dammit! 

Hey. Hey, you're that Mysterion kid.

Because you spent all of our money on those stupid rides, fatass! Now, either you're getting on a bull or I'm gonna break your fuckin' head open!

Stan?

How do you do that?

Well, Cartman

I can't keep doing it, Wendy. I know he has an illness, but goddamn, it uh, it's like being around a black hole that just sucks the life out of everything.

...God-damnit, here!  Alright, Timmy, let's go! 

Let's all try to help a little, 'cause 

Wendy, it isn't your egg anymore!

Cartman, no!

Whoa, dude..!

Nancy Kerrigan got the silver, dude. She came in second.

Hey, is your show as good as America Idol?

We'll give you 10 bucks.

Aww, come on!

This is really gay.

So, dude, do you have any brothers or sisters?

I'm never gonna win that two tons of candy looking like everybody else!

With his power, I can finally make the earth a better place for the Jews!

Well how come Kenny's family eats frozen waffles for dinner and has rats on the floor, and we have a big house and lots of food?

How come we never get opportunities like that?

Like a..big hunk of dirt with a carrot sticking out of it.

Rebecca. You...

How come the visitors aren't coming for him.

No, wait. No, we have to stop them! They're raping him. Rape!

All right,  check it out, I-  Butters, BUTTERS. What the fuck?! Are you peeing in the pool?!

Dude! I almost thought those Afghani kids talked you into not liking America.

What the fuck?!

Right. Why?

I'm gonna make a new costume during recess. I can still win that candy.

Wow. Your mom's pregnant, Kenny.

He talked! I swear to Abraham he talked, and he loves rocket ships!

I don't care! You'd better remember where your base is!

Cool.

No, No thanks, that stuff tastes like pee.

Dude, w-what are you doing?

Me too.

Ike. Ike!  It's over.

Do you see anything?

Yeah.

You son of a bitch! I won't let you win!

I don't want to! I don't want anybody telling me how to feel anymore!

Uh, Mr. President, my name is-

Just just leave it alone.

Oh God, what have I done?!  I'm sorry. Please, I don't wanna be the vessel for the Antichrist.

Nuh uh! It's "Whoever denied it, supplied it!"

They're just taking Indiana Jones and they're...  they're raping him! 

Duhuhude! You barfed into the incision!

Let's just stay here and watch the whale swim around some more.

This copy of Lord of the Rings made the young Butters behave quite awfully.

Certainly.

Do you know anybody with herpes?

Stop being a pouty little bitch 'cause you lost, Cartman!

Butters, what's happened to you?

Hey Stan. 

Uh, hi, we want you to end this strike. 

Yeah, dude! Kenny just died eight hours ago from that monster! How could he have died back then, too?

Yeah! Go to the tobacco company yourself!

What?

Okay, Cartman, what do you want?

This is what God told us to do!

Can Kenny block his elderbeast?

Hello, Stan.

Well, I was just digging around, and I was all like, 'dude, I found this triangle' and my friends were like, 'dude' and I was all like 'dude.'

God-dammit! Come on, we can go watch it at my house!

Hide! 

What?

Then he's perfect for us.

What are we gonna do?

Steve, look out! 

Goddamnit, you see what happens when you spread this stupid crap, fatass?

It isn't fair. Cartman's fatter than the goal.

We can't fight them, Cartman.

Yes! It did!

I have no idea.

Yee-yeah.

Cartman, that's the dumbest thing you've ever said - this week!

Be sure to vote for Giant Douche.

But where are we gonna get the money to buy costumes and and the instruments? 

It doesn't even look like they're open. 

Whoa, dude.

The what?

Cartman, you go ahead and do the commercial tomorrow. But I'm warning you, those anti-smoking people are liars and they're bullies who will stop at nothing to get what they want, and that means they're dangerous. 

Coach! Coach, I'm all better. I'm ready to play.

He does kind of look like him dude. And Kenny thinks Cartman's Gordon Ramsay impersonation is really good.

We can't, dude. Not until we find Mr. Hankey. 

Hey, it looks like one of those Etheropians.

What's the matter?

It's not enough! Ever since Kenny switched sides, there are more kids that wanna go with PS4 on Black Friday.

It's too bad Cartman can't be here to enjoy this.

I don't know what to do. I just can't seem to get my friend numbers to go up. I'm desperate. That's why I came to you.

Um, we... sssort of spend all the money on this... one...

You bastards!

You bastards!

There's no such thing as Mr. Hankey.

We're ignoring him.

What the hell do you think you're doing spreading this crap to kids?!

Hey... Hey, we know a place! We know a place where everything is just happiness and joy. And no humans are there to mess it up.

Ass full of pork fat
jiggles like a Jello mold.
Mouth is flapping, too.

Gosh, thanks, Rick James.

Hey, Cartman, do you think God's getting mad at you for not making $10 million? 

Goddamnit, Cartman! What are they gonna say on Cop Drama?

Stan, I have to go home!! I need my cream!! I need my creeheam!!

You can't! Poor Ike must be so scared, up there all alone. You gotta help me, dude! 

You can? Awesome!

Dad, there is so a tooth fairy, huh?

What else has big round squishy globes? 

...And if you look here, you can see how David Blaine performed the miracle of being frozen in ice at Times Square.

Cartman, stop! You don't know what you're doing!

It's not lame, it's sweet! After we build this clubhouse, we're gonna get girls to play Truth or Dare!

You're welcome. 

Oh good! Cartman's back from the junkyard.

They're goin' to show the new Terrance & Phillip trailer

Who's that?

You bastard!

We'll never stop them now.

Wait. It's okay. Look, maybe these people all turned out because they believe in saving films. Maybe they don't even care about the free hats.

He's going to kindergarten because he's a genius!

Haven't you noticed everyone getting sick? It all started when they said "shit" on television.

It's too late, fatass.  They'll be here in less than a minute.

Awww, shit!

HA! I killed you!

It's okay. Everyone, it's okay. Perhaps one day, you will all understand. What I do, I do because I care about each and every one of you. 

Well, now we know.

Uh... W-uh... but... Come o- come on! Really? I mean, aren't there more important things going on right now?

We're right here dude. Do you remember now?

Shit!

Wow, there's a lot of profiles here. Kyle Broflovski's amazed Stan has so many Facebook friends. Hey, Kyle Broflovski's amazed Isiah is also a Facebook friend of Stan's.

Hey, uh- we were all just talkin' about how when you get better, we're all gonna go down to Stark's Pond again and go camping. Huh, Stan?

Yeah! Where's Grandma? 

Wait a minute. According to this you now own all the rights to Crack Baby Basketball and we got nothing.

This whole time your TV is in a house with nobody in it?!

Sir, we are really worried about our friend Clyde. Everywhere he goes people are telling him he had blood on his wiener.

I'm sorry you guys, but there is something we can do. We can go to Canada and see the Prime Minister like I said. If we can change his mind before Christmas, then your parents won't have to give my family money.

Look Butters, why don't you just talk to your family about it? You said your Grandma's visiting this week. Why don't you try talking to her?

Dude, what are we gonna do? We can't win this game.

What is it?

The red- Oh come on, you can't possibly be here for that!

I have to join Jewleeard and make Grandma proud!  Tell my parents I'll call them. 

Whoa, dude, what's going on?

What are you doing, fatass?!

We'll get back in time for a Christmas adventure.

It has to go back!

Cool!

Cartman, you okay??  You need help??

Dude, calm down.

Yeah. You definitely made your point.

Oh, God, when is this gonna end?

You what?!

Cool!

The government is gonna nuke Imaginationland.

Hybrid cars don't cause smugness, people do.  Look, hybrid cars are important. They may even save our planet one day. What you all need to do is just learn to drive hybrids and not be smug about it.

You must have a mom.  You mean she doesn't live here, or she's dead, or what?

This looks pretty good.

I won't believe it! I won't! I have to ask my mom and dad! 

He did?

He didn't want us for sex, fatass! Something is making him say those things.

No! For not being a metrosexual.

"No, please! I promise I'll never make another album or movie!"

We can't.

They're gonna say "shit" on television?

Dude! 

Get. Outta here! 

See?! I just saw your lips move!

You'll die, retard!

How long does this thing last?

I've almost got it!

Not really.

Yeah?

Please, tune in and help get America's families back in the living room.

There he is! 

Stop him, Kenny! 

What?!

It's a game, dude. It's really fun.

The only thing of yours that's larger in size is your big fat ass!

You just wanna lock me in there because you think I'm one of them.

I think I'll add some more... pigs.  Oh, maybe I should put in another field of corn there.  There we go. Nice.  Twenty nine? No, I have thirty friends.  Hey what the hell is-? Oh no! Oh shit! 

Christian rock?!

Oh no! 

We have great news! Our friend has lost forty pounds eating your City Wok food. Here's the before and after photos.

Stan, this has gone too far. People are going to get hurt. What you started is way out of control.

Shut up, Cartman!

Dude, this book says I don't exist unless I think I do. But what if I don't?

Ike, are you okay?  Ike?  Iiiike! 

They aren't gay? Then what are they?

But I can't, because, what if thinking about it is the only thing keeping my space-time together? 

You bastards!  Hey! There he is! 

He said his wish is not to die. 

What was what?

You wanna kill me?! Fine!  I can't live like this anymore! Go ahead! Do it! 

Because you're my little brother, Godddamnit!  And even when I'm fifty and you're forty-five, you're still gonna be my little brother!

This is all a bunch of crap!

I was trying to make an appointment to see the principal about getting excused on Friday. So I can take my brother to go see Yo Gabba Gabba Live.

Do you think they're gonna pissed at us for lying that they molested us and sending them all to jail for ten days?

Huuh, I wah... just ah... well... that's all. 

Well all right, we'll see you on Saturday, guys.

We'd have to put something up on the Internet that everyone would find fascinating.

What the hell?

God-damn, it's hot out here!

Well, look at it this way: statistically speaking, we're safer inside a car with an old person driving than outside.

What have you done, Cartman?!

You mean that you aliens actually enjoy sitting around and watching us fight and kill each other? Dude, that's messed up.

That does it! CHARGE! 

Yeah, sure. 

Ike!  Stop the bus! Miss Crabtree, you have to stop this bus!

Go on, Canadian! Beat it! I'm through getting in trouble for you!

All right, Kenny, let's go!  Kenny?  Kenny!  Don't worry, Kenny. You didn't die for nothing.  We're gonna get Wing back as our client and... and make a ton of money! I swear it to you!

Why?

Dude, the sooner you eat your peas, the sooner you can try to win some of your friends back. Eh ya you need to Bill Clinton this.

We have to face it, Cartman.

Who the hell reads that entire thing every time it pops up?

Cartman, do you remember how we all spent the night at Kenny's a couple of days ago?

Stan?

Wuwhat's going on?

You bastards. YOU BASTARDS!

Well, we got some cigarettes, but we don't think you should be smoking. Each year, over a million people die of smo-

Why do they even allow those things in stored?

Cartman, you dumbass! You can't get a new one!

That is the dumbest idea you guys have ever come up with! I'd expect this stupidity out of Cartman, but you, Stan?! Butters needs medical attention right now!

D'you have any wire here?

Yeah... He must be really sick.  Hang on Willzy-x. There's still hope. Stan and Craig might still luck with the space program down in Mexico.

You're a fat skank, Mom, and your tits belong in a morgue.
