Cartman, don't be such a baby! We're supposed to be rugged outdoorsmen!
Do you know how to start a fire?
But Dad, this is all the never-before-seen footage.
I'm declaring Shenanigans on you! This game is rigged!
No matter what we think, it's not just a passing trend. We need to realize that the new generation of entertainment is here.  And I, think that's great.
Yeah. People are willing to pay big money to see Kenny do this stuff.
Stan, you're just jealous of that third grader and you think Wendy's gonna go for him unless you start singing and dancing too.
Yeah, he was too young to be taken from us.
Doctor, this is Muhammad. We want you to clone him, so we can give his copies to gingers, and Barbra Streisand.
What are we gonna do, Stan? It's, it's not like we can change the way an entire country thinks. I don't like it, but it's just the way they are.
Guys! You guys!  Listen: Cartman has tens of thousands of voter ballots hidden somewhere. He's changed the outcome of the election!
Because we do. It was like this yesterday, and the day before that.
Please, Ma. I don't think Kenny has anywhere else to be tonight.
Hey! Isn't there where Stark's Pond used to be? Where we used to kayak and fish?
Now, wait a minute! Everyone just stop for one minute!  Look, you guys are gonna end up killing her. Can't you see that Britney isn't in any condition to handle this crap anymore? I know watching celebrities go down can be fun. Me and my friends are just as guilty as all of you, but maybe, we'll just, maybe, ...it's time to let this one go. Just this one time, let's, let's all stop before it's too late, huh?
You know what you assholes like! You like to fuck! And shit! And fuck! And fuck! And fuck! And fuck!
We've got work to do Stan, I think it takes a while for an elephant to get drunk.
Look, we've just gotta get Chef alone. He won't listen to reason with that hooker around.
You've got to stop, Dad. If the South wins, me and Stan have to be Cartman's slaves!
What if this is all just somebody's dream?
I'm going to try to save Stan and Butters from getting nuked!
Why are they all out driving at the same time?
Nobody gives a crap about your Trapper Keeper, Cartman! 
Dude, we have to do whatever we can to get that feeding tube put back in!
Anyway, that will give me plenty of time playing video games.
I don't want to! It's a stupid name! 
It's not stupid, Stan. For once in my life I feel like I'm part of something.
Dude, I know you're pissed at me right now. You've gotta understand that I did it because I know in my heart that the XBox is better, for all of us.
We're here dude. Just a little further and we can finally end this.
Aaaarrghhhhhh!  I'm not one of them! Do you understand me?! You'd better get that through your fat head! I will never be one of them, and if you say it again, I swear to God, I'll smash your fucking teeth in! 
The liposuction is a process of siphoning out the excess fat. 
No thanks. We're trying to unbrainwash our friend.
Who's everyone?! Who all is in on this?!
Jesus, this sucks! All they keep doin' is dancing around!
Can you imagine it, Stan. A mind, emptied by that... thing.
Yes, I believe that you believe you helped write that joke. That's how people like you work! Your ego is so out of whack that it will do whatever it can to protect itself. And people with a messed up ego can do these mental gymnastics to convince themselves they're awesome, when really, they're just douchebags! 
You can't! Poor Ike must be so scared, up there all alone. You gotta help me, dude! 
And then like, out of nowhere, somebody came up with the idea of ziplining.
I hate you, remember?  You wanna be partners, Jimmy?
How can I not be nervous? Trying out for the All-State team has been my dream for years.
We can't. Kenny just checked. There's a wall of people like seven miles thick behind us.
It's not new!! I'm gonna look "shit" up in the encyclopedia and prove it!!
How do we find somebody who can wrestle that well?
Ike, you can't come to school with me. 
Well!  You're gonna be sorry when you see me riding around on Santa's sleigh with Mr. Hankey, fatass!
Stan? Oh. Well, no, there's nothing here from Stan, but, well, Stan's gonna come and see you real soon, I bet, Kenny.
I can't say "ookie mouth" and have Kenny spit down my throat at the same time. It's impossible. 
Yeah dude, we made you your own Facebook page. 
Cartman was right! The holiday season is for idiots!
No, I'm being totally serious. That is the best idea you've ever had. You should run away to Mogadishu. You should go there right away. I'll even help pay for your ticket.
Wait... stop it, stop it!  I can't let Kenny be sock-dried.
Wha-? Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You Bastards!
Dude, we have got to get that kid away from him!
Naw, I think I'm through with fads for a while.
Sometimes I think I can see time slowing down,  and my own existence fading.
What?!! Sick, dude, I'm not kissing a girl!
They never grow old because they die before they're 30!
I'm just not sure this is the name people are gonna give money to.
Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo. Haven't you guys ever heard of it?
"The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few?" That was Wrath of Khan.
We have to confess that we were the ones that-
Excuse me, what are you doing to my locker?!
Because that sounds like we don't have anything, We've been through this already, Stan!
Please Dad, I've been looking forward to this all week. Aaand it's me and Ike's bonding time. Really. This is good for our relationship.
Hey, wait a minute.  Is it possible that...
He's right. We have to take a hard stance right now and establish that we're the dominant ones in this relationship! 
Gone are the dark clouds that had me-
Come on, dude. I wanna get out of here.
Yeah, what if they had modified the Roman Coliseum every year? It would just be another big douchey stadium now.
He beat us. Because all this time we've been so caught up with how to protect our music that we forgot to just play.
Oh! Hey Cartman. We're playing dreidel; you wanna try?
The South loses this battle, Cartman. They lose the war!
Yeah... He must be really sick.  Hang on Willzy-x. There's still hope. Stan and Craig might still luck with the space program down in Mexico.
That's not what I was trending! They took my hash tag and they raped it! Where is Ike?!
And that's why I feel like you guys are more than just friends. You're my family.  Except for Cartman.
I'm confused. Did Ally Sheedy take that personality test?
Do you mind telling us what the hell is going on??
Don't worry, Ike. Squirts is fun. And I'll be right over there in the next building. 
Whoa, hang on! We shouldn't be learning how not to get caught. We have to take responsibility for our actions. 
Dude, I just got an IM from Stan that they evacuated the school.
Stan, you can't let that Tad guy get to you. Screw him, dude.
Well we got tickets to see Terrance and Phillip Live in Denver tomorrow night. We paid forty bucks apiece for them.
Do you really think your civilization is better than ours?! You people play games by killing animals, and oppress women!
Hey! We should buy Ms. Ellen Valentine's Day presents. 
Butters! We said you can't watch it! We have a quest!
What the hell is wrong with you, Cartman? Haven't you noticed the three feet of snow on the ground?
Ex, excuse me?  My name is... Brad. And uh I need to report a crime. Anonymously.
Well at least my mom's not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!
They found the butt-face people's son, Butters. They're gonna have a big reunion at the milk company!
You know why! Because we're trying to keep our parents from watching murder porn!
Why?! So I could be sitting in the hospital waiting to die, like Stan?!
What the hell are you doing telling people that we're a gay couple?!
Thank you for seeing us, Mr. Johnson. We were hoping that maybe you have some kind of key that can help us with our disease.
Vi, Visitors, this morning you took my little brother, Ike. He's the little freckled kid that looks like a football. At first, I was happy you took him away. But I've learned something today. That having a little brother... is a pretty special thing.
No, don't you see? Cartman never had psychic visions. And neither do these people. The plain simple truth is that nobody is psychic. There's a logical explanation for every psychic story you've ever heard.
They were wearing cowboy hats!  Did you see??  Did you see?? 
Here's our cell phone, dude.  Will you call the police for us? 
No way, dude, then I'd have to suck Cartman's balls
Yeah, dude! Kenny just died eight hours ago from that monster! How could he have died back then, too?
It means Jehovah is going to use his powers to keep the Pharaoh from letting us go.
We found it, you guys!  Oh no, they followed us! 
He is under alien control. That thing in his butt is linked up to the visitors!
It would've been faster if Cartman hadn't slashed the tires!
We totally think you should have more money.
No, dude, you don't wanna bring your people to Mexico, there's missionaries there, too.
No-no-no-no. Come on, fatass, we're gonna get 'em all back.
I'm sure we're gonna get word any minute that people have agreed to stop. 
Dad! Somebody's at the front door!  Well am I grounded or not?!  Ugh. Fine! I'll get it! 
All right.  All right, I guess it's possible.
Lots of people will when I tell them!
Just admit it, Congo! Admit that you lied about me to Irene!
So I'm thinking we do the part about Jimmy's relationship with his alcoholic father after you smash Butters onto the table.
Just, you know, make some money off him. Like Honey Boo boo.
Give it up, Kenny! You're not gonna win that costume contest! Your costumes always suck. 
No, I'm serious! I wanna see what's happening downstairs, so let's just do it! 
Excuse me.  Do you know which way the network president's office is?
Yep. But I guess this proves that war is the natural order of life.
Cartman!! Wake up you fat piece of crap!! 
Well why not? You want us to get AIDS?
Are you serious?? Look around: doesn't this bother you at all??  That's YOU one day, fatass! Not even one day! If you don't change something, that's you! In about a year! 
Ah, I told you we shouldn't have brought him to school dude.
Well, our friend Marvin and all his people have to live on a part of Earth that sucks ass. They can't grow food or nothin'.
I'm making a dummy Ike doll. My parents think he's out with me right now, and I have to bring him back for dinner.
No! We can't divide like this!  Stan?  You're on our side, right?
Look, just go ahead and play, alright?  Leave me alone.  Can I get a Fresca, please?
Well, let's just try to finish all this coffee, so we can stay up.
Yeah. He's almost as bad as that guy on Full House.
We... didn't realize what we were doing, eh...
Look, maybe he's forgiven us. I mean, we were only in preschool
Don't worry, guys. I'm getting a nurection as we speak.
Come on Eric, we can go play at the bus stop.
Yeah, our friend has been missing for a few days, so we went and checked on him, and he's in a coma wearing your headset.
E-excuse me, w-we aren't going back now? Aren't we done?
Yes, ah I'm trying to locate my parents. M-my name is Kyle Broflovski. Yes, I know Obama won.
Aw, stop it, Cartman! Your hand hand doesn't need to breathe!
Yeah. They're tryin' to scare everybody 'cause they're gay wads.
'Kay, so now just click on the little soil button...  and then maybe put a sign up to comment on my farm...  Okay, now I can read the sign you put up...
We made it! It hasn't gone to commercials yet. 
The kindergarten teacher is having sex with my little brother.
Butters, you know goddamned well you didn't write that book!
It's the only way to prove to them that you're real.
Yeah, I like him a lot more than Cartman.
We said we wouldn't be a part of this fad and look at you!
Rebecca, in public school,  we select our... own mate.  In public school, men and women get together. Make each other happy.
I think I see the television department in the back!
You're not gonna die, Kenny. Don't be stupid.
Look dude, it's just one movie. We wanna have a good time.
"David Blaine Workshop. Learn all about David Blaine at the Center for Magic." Dude, we gotta go.
I'm still not inviting you to Casa Bonita.
And Cartman for having a whore for a mom.
Look, it may not seem important now, but your vote really does count, and we all have to do our part.
Cartman? Your side won, dude. Why are you so sad?
I dunno. I just have this sudden urge to go back.
Yeah, all you have to do is fart some more, Cartman! And the visitors are sure to come!
Dude, I don't wanna watch this thing have a baby.
Wha?! Well wait, ahah I wanna see what happens here!
It's the holiday season, but the good times... are ending.Because what matters most isn't what's good, it's what's trending.
This younger generation, with their eyes and ears glued:
What's trending to them is trenders who trend on YouTube.
We can get everyone back into the Christmas spirit by making our very own animated Christmas special, and showing it to everybody in town! 
We went through all that just for some gay video of Earth?
That bull sucks! He's not even bucking or anything!
Sir, you recently passed a new law allowing parents who have given their children up for adoption to change their minds. My little brother was-
Noo, I'll just... be... going back to bed now.
Stan, it's over. You have to admit what you did so our parents could help us! 
Mom? Can Kenny go to Jewbilee with me?
Yeah. And the leader, he said that all the Ethiopians can go live there. 
Yeah, isn't he just supposed to be learning how to read?
Give me the drum, and you play the flute.
Your grandma left it to you! You didn't earn it!
You won't get more votes than us, asshole!
Aww. Well Cartman, you can change things about yourself.
Well, I had to see it to believe it!
Really? Thanks, dude! I'm gonna go get a video camera! 
Let's go. Oh my God, that smells good. 
You can't believe it?? He does this shit all the time!
Dude, you're just saying that because she's your girlfriend.
Well, I turned off all my Apple stuff. They can't locate you if you don't have your stuff on, right? 
This whole time your stupid story was just a way to rip on me for being Jewish at Christmas again!
Car... Cartman! You've gotta swim! Kick with your legs!
Dude, why is your store called "The Indian Burial Ground Pet Store?"
Oh my God! You did lie to me.
Ike, you can't possibly want this. We have to tell Mom.
Dude, boars are only worth two experience points apiece. Do you know how many we would have to kill to get up 30 levels?
Love ...is the most important thing on... earth. When boys and girls feel ...love, they kiss.
It's just that... I really need this A, Stan. And Bebe did say you almost broke your last egg.
So wait, wait: Stan took a dump in the urinal and he contacted the conspiracy Web site? But the conspiracy site was run by the government?
...Alright, that does it!  This has been bothering the hell out of me!  I knew it! You're not Cartman at all!
Dude, L. Ron Hubbard was a science-fiction writer. He lived on a boat with only young boys and got busted by the feds numerous times.
Sorry, sorry. You know how after we spent the night at Kenny's house and-and you and Cartman got sick with chickenpox?
There's no choice anymore, guys. Don't worry about me. I've been preparing for this for a while now. 
Yeah. Too bad you're such a dumbass in history, or you would have known that!
Dude! How are we gonna move twenty three calves to your house?
Well uh, he'll have to do. Cartman has to get some practice with a real bull.
Cartman, we should probably talk about our chances.
...star-starting to become alienated from some of your friends.
Look Butters, why don't you just talk to your family about it? You said your Grandma's visiting this week. Why don't you try talking to her?
I knew it! It wasn't because I gave that guy twenty dollars! The homeless all came from here!
No ending? Well, we can't animate until we have our voices recorded, so we'd better just record what we have and figure out the ending later. 
Hm, I wasn't really going for "gay," I was more going for "wholesome."
Is it illegal for Jewish people to eat Christmas snow?
Hey yeah! That'd be sweet! We could totally ruin their lives! 
The base where you're from and where our Okama GameSphere is! 
Yeah, we're the Goonies, Cartman. Why don't you pretend like you're the fat kid?
Well, so then WWE will recruit us and not them.
Just let us stay up a little longer, mom. Mr. Hankey's gotta show up. He always does.
Stop saying "hella," Cartman!  How are we gonna win the contest with a squash?  Whoa, Stan. You don't look so good.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have an epidemic in our country. Obesity is costing taxpayers millions, and some are taking advantage of a system that is flawed. Over the past several days I have filmed such a case, and the shocking video has been edited by my partner, Token. It is our hope that this film will cast light on a serious issue. 
I know. Something big is going on. Take a look at this. I did a Google search for "Hillary Clinton Campaign Rally" right? And one of the links was to YouTube, where this Russian guy had a bunch of videos.
But, but he's lying! He doesn't have a conscience!
Kenny, what's funnier? A giant douche or a turd sandwich?
I don't know.  Oh, great. He's got that stupid beard on again.
Dude, it just can't be better than ours. It just can't be.
They sneak out during class and make out in the hallways!
Yes. I'm saying one-fourth of Americans are retards.
Yeah, we made the whole thing up. It was all just a really, really funny joke! 
Steve, you don't have to freeze yourself. Look!
You mean, throw the game? You know how our parents are about this sport.
See, when you start invading people's privacy, eh thinking it's harmless to put up pictures of them they didn't want up - Kenny! - you start a domino effect that eventually screws everything up for everybody!
Come, on, Kenny! I'll give you five bucks to do it!
No it isn't. Come on, I have an idea.
It wasn't like Faith Hilling was that great. I mean-
So, do you agree to fight him after school?
They all laugh at me!  And the girls giggle behind my back!  unable to even glance at my disfigured face.
This is sweet, being rugged outdoorsmen.  Facing the wilderness, not having to be home until 8:30,... 
Wow. Did he say that in the Bible?
Wait. It's okay. Look, maybe these people all turned out because they believe in saving films. Maybe they don't even care about the free hats.
Tattle-tale?! Do you know how serious this is?!
Why do people have to keep reminding us of what we don't have?!
Well, but, this is the jacket I always wear.
Yeah he's an idiot but uh I'm sorry, I just... I can't do this anymore, okay? I... I can't do this anymore! 
Dude, I don't think Kenny's coming back. My dad said those Child Protective Services people are pretty serious.
We can't miss the final apocalyptic battle between Good and Evil!
I need one ticket for my little brother.
We told you they were real Cartman. Sorry to hear about your ass.
You know God damned well what's going on! This ends right now! We are a family, and you need to go somewhere else!
Phew. The one videotape is sought after indeed.
He didn't do anything. He was always with his new girlfriend.
It's still stupid and now I paid 49 cents for it!
City Wok brought him down to a size 4.
I don't know how you do it, dude. How do you get up in front of that many people?
Twenty... million?  Are you nuts? We don't have that kind of money.
Yes we do! Just not the Christian heaven!
Dude, will you just end this thing now?! My little brother is gonna die!
I have to save my little brother! I have to send him away until my parents come to their senses!  Come on, Ike!  Cover me for a while. I'll find a place to hide him and come back.
But Chef, you just ripped on Chinese people.
Aawwww! Hey Dad. Is it true that you and Kenny's dad used to be best friends when you were young?
Dude, why the hell would you DO that?!
It's too late. The treatment would have killed it all.
I can see clearly now, the rain is goneI can see all obstacles in my way-
Mom, Ike did it again. I don't know what's going on with him, but, it's like he hates me.
I'm not going to help you freeze yourself, Cartman! It's a stupid idea!
Alright, we don't know for sure why Cartman is ditching school, but it has something to do with abortion. That's all we know.
Don't panic. I'll tell you what to say.  You can tell them...
Get up, fat boy! I'm gonna kick your ass!
You don't understand! Willzy-x is from the moon! He'll die if we don't get him back, now! Willzy-x, you have to talk! Come on boy, you have to! I know you're sick, but you could do it!
God damn it this is serious, you guys! Cartman has stolen the election!
Does it look like a pig, or an elephant?
Aw, dude! You can still kinda see the spleen!  How much, Kenny?
All that time and effort we spent helping Token and this is the thanks we get?!
Wow! I guess reading really does suck ass!
I'm not cheesing. I've never cheesed once in my life.
You made hamburgers? Well that's awesome! I'd love one.  Mmm. Hm, wow  This is really good, Cartman.
Ooogh. Dude, the thing is, we're not the ones that made them crack babies. That's their moms' goddamned fault!
Guess what? You're not my best friend anymore! Cartman's my new best friend!
But how are we gonna get to the North Pole?
Dude, totally. With Kenny's Magic skills, we could probably kick serious ass!
This is it, Stan. If you strike this kid out, we all get to go home.
Yeah. It's almost as big as Cartman's ass.
Just tell us where Lemmiwinks is being held prisoner so we can kill this stupid rat!
I don't wanna know when I'm going to die, fatass! 
No, it's Cartman. Something's really wrong with him. 
Can I have three thousand dollars, Mom and Dad, huh?? Can I??
It's no use. There's nobody around for miles.
Aww gee, that's... so sad. Everyone should have one Facebook friend.
It's unbelievable, Stan. EA Sports just used us the entire time. We worked for nothing and EA made all the money. You know, I don't think we actually deserved getting screwed over but, but I guess making tons of money off of people who are making nothing is always gonna cause problems. I know, I know, right? We might've got screwed, but the really tragic thing is that those, those poor crack babies at the hospitals are just gonna be stuck there, with nowhere to go.  No way!  This is it!
Hey! Hey, let me out of here! This is a mistake! I agreed by accident!
I guess we should all realize...  that history and alien technology really do go hand in hand. 
Broflovski looks for Kenny to get clear for the pass.
It's true.  He doesn't care what faith you are.
Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo
he loves me and I love you
Therefore, vicariously he loves you
Even if-
Yeah. We're gonna call you Fartboy from now on.
I'm going to see the Queer Eye For the Straight Guy people.
...Okay Cartman, what do you want this time?
Yeah. But there was so much of it. I was up until two in the morning.
I said I'm sorry, you piece of sh- 
Chef, have you ever had something happen to you, but nobody believed you?
Well, he screwed us by makin' something up; I say we do the same thing.
Mom, Dad, can I have money to buy Chinpokomon?
Not if you... have some delicious farts for me.
So, how are things going at Cartman's theme park?!
Dude, did you finish your math homework? I kind of lost track of time last night.
No, ah I didn't lie to you. Ah I was um... uh I felt better and then the guys called and said that they felt better and uh-
My God-damned little brother's trying to follow me to school, again!
There's some terrorists or bankrobbers or something that have taken our class hostage!
I totally know how we can give the gingers and the celebrities what they want, but keep Muhammad safe. Come on! 
Okay, there. Now we can carry this egg around in this case without it getting cracked.
What?! You said we had plenty of money, Cartman!
I'll meet up with you guys in a little bit. I-I wanna hang out here some more.
You just want Family Guy off the air...
Well it's just that, eh, this seems like another one of those times when things are gonna get way out of hands, you know? It's been happening a lot lately. How about this time we just put a stop to it right now?
No, Cartman, I have no idea what you're talking about!
Well, what's the point? Jimmy always wins with his stand-up comedy.
I TIVO every episode. We can go to my house and see what they did.
Cartman, you hike me the ball, then somebody run, and I'll throw it at something. Ready?!
Yeah. This is like the third day in a row. I wonder what's wrong
Yeah! Next time you make up a word, don't make up one that already exists!
Dude, I didn't know Token lived so far away.
Oh God, what have I done?!  I'm sorry. Please, I don't wanna be the vessel for the Antichrist.
Damn it! Come on! I'll try to get more money from my mom. 
I have to watch out for my glasses. Ow! Ow, it's so cold! Oh Jesus! 
Look, he knows full well what he's doing, and he's just waiting for us to buy into it, and then he'll laugh and point at our faces and say, "Haha, I got you guys to believe me!" "You guys are stupid!"
I actually hugged you. I held you in my arms and, and, cried with you.
Okay, I got a text of the Russian guy's podcast. It's all a bunch of links to eBay.
Yeah, let's watch Yo Gabba Gabba, like old times.
We didn't think that by pretending you didn't exist, you would really change, but you really have.
Stan, we're almost there. You've got to hold on.
Excuse me, this isn't exactly what I had in mind!
Kenny's ashes were in an urn, and Cartman drank it, thinking it was chocolate milk mix.
Well, that's a public school. And in it there are children,  just like us.
Oh well, I I grew up in the shity, ah ah I really don't care for it. Ah I come from a Jewish family, which of course you already know, because Kyle's from the same family.  I like to read, and I have these polyps on the backs of my hands - I don't know what they are.
Off the air? But... we're just going to try to get the Mohammad episode pulled.
They're TV dinners. Don't you wanna take that veil off so you can eat?
Well, we tried, dude. If anyone else in this craphole hates Americans, we'd better just leave the goat and get back to the plane!
Wait!  I may not have Santa, but I do have Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo.
We can't. We're saving our money for the balls in Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth game.
Alright alright Kenny, calm down. You're too young to be getting BJs anyway. It's good you and Tammy are making a commitment to each other that isn't based on sex.
Well, then you gotta ride it out, Butters.
I said go away!  My father said you aren't real.
Ah I'm sorry, but I don't really care. I just want to know what medication my little has been getting from you, and why?!
That's what the sixth graders do behind the school at recess. They take way too much cough medicine because they say it makes them see things in their heads.
Cartman! I will not stand by and let you cheat your way to winning the Special Olympics!
I am sooo sick of that stupid bitch! Blabbin' pussy little skank! Why do people talk on their phone like that?! I can't even get a minute of piece before that bitch walks in, holding the cell phone out like this , and talking on speaker phone! Nobody wants to hear your goddamned conversations, you little bitch! You're not that important!
Yeah. And you know, now that I think about it, third grade wasn't all that great, either.
Dumbass, if there's sixty percent of them to forty percent of us, then who's the minority?!
Come on you guys, we need to figure out how to get out of school so we can get my little brother back.
This is wrong. Uh this just doesn't make any sense. Why would Homeland Security send us into Peru?
Okay. We've got $15 between us. That means we get nine balls to throw.
We're trying to raise money for our school chef.
Dude, this guy's trying to rook us! We can go someplace else!
Don't you get it?! You can't have any Trapper Keepers, fat ass!
Because some people think vaccinations can give you autism or Asperger's!
Yeah. You aren't having any doubts, are you?
Stan, I told you. My mom doesn't want Ike playing hockey. She thinks it's dangerous.
Oh cool. We get to watch a movie?
How are you going to try to get invited to Casa Bonita this time?
Well ah I guess in wrestling we're supposed to make our own outfit, and then wear it over this.
This is our shot at making it into the WWE. To be real wrestlers. 
And so, red hair, light skin, and freckles are all passed down genetically. A child's red hair is not determined by the lack of a soul,  but by the melanins which control the pigment in all of our skins. Thank you. 
I'm sure. Abe Lincoln was right: I don't wanna find out I'm good-looking and become a total shithead when I grow up.
No way, dude! It sucked ass! They don't even have cable!
All right, all right, you could be Jesus, you tubby cry-baby!
Well, looks like everything turned out alright for them.
Sir, just think about what you're doing to free speech!
Yeah, what do you guys wanna do now?
Dude, just ask Chef for help. He always knows what to do.
We want all the country to see that Kenny is alive, and in pain!
This is it, Stan!  It's just like I designed it. There's the miniature gold course over there! And slides and uh,  excuse me, what is this place?
And this kid is watching Cartman commenting on people commenting on Dragon Age.
Wait a minute! I've got it! The bullriding contest. Cartman could ride a bull, and try to win $5000.  Think about it, dude: $5000. That's 1000 set of balls. That's 3000 balls! We'd have to win enough to get the dolls!
Not when  if I say he's sick and put him to bed right away.  No, go away! Bad dog!
We're not fucking you, they're fucking Stan's grandpa!
But it's our game. We bought it together.
Hey, Kenny. How much for you to eat this?
But we don't have years! If Chef keeps this up, he's gonna go to jail forever!
Dad? Don't you think our last new house is big enough?
Uh, oh, this, this is, the new retarded kid.
Dude! Timmy's chair is packed with all that stuff! We've gotta help him!
Nah, dude. Are you on America's side, Stan? 
We're gonna make a short animated Christmas card that everyone can watch and play it on the screen at the old drive-in.
How stupid do you think we are?! Now you die on that cross and get resurrurected before I kick your ass!
Dude, I don't think we should be messing around with that crap anymore.
Dude, you killed your own dad, and you're worried about that?!
Platform 4F. Uhhh, it must be on the other side of the station.
Ike, I just want us to be friends again.
We don't have time for this! Kenny, keep him away from us! 
I don't know what to do.  Part of me feels like I wanna end it all now.  Tell people what heppened. You know, I never knew how beautiful this pond was before.  So cold. The world can feel like that.  So calm on the outside, as if nothing bad ever happens.  Ow.  What the hell are you doing, Cartman?!
We don't know where Cartman is, Ms. Choksondik!
Look out! Here comes the great dragon of Perengraph!
You son of a bitch.  You didn't solve your homeless problem, you just sent all your homeless to South Park! 
This has gone far enough!  How can we make people see the difference between being sensitive to obesity and letting fat people walk all over us?!
Well, I fell down this ice cavern,  and I saw this block of ice, so I told my friend to throw a rope- 
Alright guys, do you think he's lying or telling the truth?
Why the hell don't people tell me these things?!
Well, let's try the dictionary.  queasy, Quebec, queen quelch. No queef.
That's not true. Kids at school like us. Don't they?
Because now he's acting like gingers are awesome. And all his friends are gingers. When he wakes up tomorrow and realizes he isn't really ginger, it'll be hysterical!
Wow! Oh, and look over there, that's that Jake Jabs guy from American Furniture Warehouse commercials. 
Huuh, I wah... just ah... well... that's all. 
Who cares if your dog is gay? Maybe it's not that bad.
I'm never speaking to either of you ever again! 
Dude, I don't wanna see a bunch of guys' penises!
Oh n-no, I'm not really friends with him.
Yeah, well people should  know that peeing in pools is  bad!
You mean to tell me that all this time I've been trying to protect Ike from having his fireman cut off, and he's not even my real brother?!
Ike is starting his first day of kindergarten.
Look, that was a long time ago. Maybe Trent Boyett has forgotten all about it.
You too! Right now! #webelieveinyou! We've got to make him appear! 
Somebody bet on you, Jesus. You said yourself that one person still had money on you.
A ladder to heaven.  We build it, climb up, and get our winning ticket back from that asshole Kenny.
Oh no, don't try to pin this on me! You're the one who brought it up!
I know, but dude, we can't license our games to EA Sports and pay the crack babies nothing. Slavery is illegal.
Ike, I'm sorry, but I couldn't get us out of school Friday. I can't take you to Yo Gabba Gabba Live.
We're so sorry. Please forgive my little brother. He's going through puberty.
That people shouldn't sue each other all the time.
How many iPod Nanos is friendship worth? I guess, one.
They picked up my hash tag, Stan! I'm trending!
It sure is. Do you want me to watch it with you, Ike?
But that sucks. I don't want something to have that much power over me.
He's just... changing a lot. He walks around angry, telling me I'm stupid and, and all he talks about is sex.
Don't you "Oh, brother" me! She's the woman of my dreams!
Yeah, try to have everyone make peace so it doesn't seem like a big deal.
I can seriously hold my breath longer than anybody. Somebody time me, all right?
Whoa Cartman. Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night.
Kenny, we have got to make Stan understand the importance of voting, because he'll definitely vote for our guy.
I'm sorry. You must've been worried sick. I got your sled tangled up with a bus. 
No! Dude! I want the Terrance and Phillip dolls up there.
Hey dudes.  Sorry I couldn't make it yesterday. What'd you guys do?
Because, dude, we're playing detectives! Detectives don't just go tell on people.
Ike, please. I know your first love seems like the only love, but trust me, it's not. You have so much life ahead of you. 
But dude, there must be something in your past you're not dealing with.
Mayor! We have the solution to your problem.
Ah... Oh Butters,  it'll be all right. Listen, we've all learned that people look for meaning in books. And sometimes, even if it isn't there, they'll try and invent their own meaning.
He was out all alone in the middle of the night. Mr. Jefferson isn't even home.
Well, Tweek's okay, but he's certainly no Kenny! 
How come you didn't buy any cards, Stan?
Yeah. And then we can try the football field. 
Oh God! It wasn't thirty, it was one! He jumped over one homeless person with his stupid skateboard, and he barely made it over that guy!
Well, I guess it's mostly the way Mr. Garrison stuck a gerbil up Mr. Slave's ass.
Well, we can still pre-tend like we know what it means.
What are we supposed to do with him?
No, I'm serious. What is that behind you?
Wait!  I brought him! I brought him to show you! 
I found the number for a really cheap airline to Canada. If we go as soon as possible, then-
...No, dude, that's not the trailer for Terminator 5, that really happened.
Oh, yeah. Yeh-yeah. It's a-it's not even noticeable. 
Come out here and talk to me face to face! Open this door!
What's the big deal? Don't you understand what ignorant prejudice like that can lead to? I have to disprove Cartman's hateful rumors! Do you know any red-haired, freckled kids?
Yeah. Just when he was being accepted he has to leave and start over.
He didn't even seem like Chef. He seemed like a empty shell of a man.
Yeah, you can't get it if you don't breathe.
I don't want to kill myself. They rigged this thing to fill with water! 
Mr. Garrison, it's Kyle! Our egg is okay! We'll be there in a couple of minutes!
Nono wait. I I know how you can reverse it, Cartman.
Scott Tenorman is an eighth grader who sold Cartman his pubes for ten dollars, and now Cartman's all pissed off.
Yeah, Cartman, you're swimming around in first-grader pee.
It doesn't matter. He'll be most excited to meet me!
They on'tday?!  Why the ellhay otnay?! It ooktay ourfay ourshay to akebay this Od-damnedgay akecay, and ownay we're otallytay ewedscray!
Get him!  Whoa, Tweek! Did you hear that?
We didn't realize hunger made you feel so bad.
Yeah! I could just say I got my period! It's not like they'll check. I can just say I got my period, 'cause I really will get it someday! It's not really lying, it's just jumping the gun a little.
Wait a minute. According to this you now own all the rights to Crack Baby Basketball and we got nothing.
Hold it!  Principal Victoria, Mr. Mackey, Mrs. Streible. We have something we need to tell you.
Well, cou, couldn't just you know, get rid of the part of Tooth Decay?
Didn't you hear? They outlawed fireworks 'cause a little boy blew off his hands.
It's my little brother. He's really changing and I feel like-
But what about Mr. Garrison? He can't go back.
Hey, that went really well. They really liked it.
Well you're NOT crazy. The whale talked to all of us. And he needs our help getting him home.
Stan, the PS4 doesn't have the seamless transition between games, movies, and TV offered by XBox One.
Yeah. If we're Jewish, are we gonna go to hell?
He's not a douche! He talked to my grandma!
Craig, we have chosen you to join our Peruvian flute band!
He worked so hard, come so close. Now we'll never see Kenny crawl up into Ms. Crabtree's uterus.
You, you paid your friends tuh...  not make fun of me?
All the cruel jokes and ridicule will finally be over! Are you happy now, God?! YOU made me look like this!
Why would they play such a cruel joke on us?
No Ike! They're playing the trailer to the new Terrance & Phillip movie during the show, and we have to watch it! 
Twenty-five cents? Well that's not even worth it.
You guys are so good you'll probably go all the way to win the national title!
That's not how a croc sounds, you fatass penis!
Let's take a test sample: There's four of us, you're a retard, that's one-fourth.
It's not a presentation, it's a hate speech! People aren't creeped out by gingers!
We believe that films have to be taken away from people like Steven Spielberg and George Lucas because they're insane.
Hey, thanks for going through all that to save my life, Stan.
This game is fixed! The balls are bigger than Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth!
Let's all try to help a little, 'cause 
Not Cartman, he gets to be on TV anyway.
Dude! I'm glad to see you. You would not believe the night I had.
Oh stop! We're not friends! He's the one who infected me with AIDS!
Jesus Christ! They can bat themselves out!  Our whole summer, dude. We have to play this boring game all summer long.
Nono Dad, please. I just got Call Of Duty: Advanced Warfare. Me and Ike are going to play it together.
What?! Does everybody have to do it, or just me?
They'd better be done with the book reports! School starts in 15 minutes!
Dude, what the hell has gotten into Cartman??
Why would the government want people to believe they caused 9/11?
Goddamnit, you know I don't carry gold in a little bag around my neck, Cartman! Whattaya want from me?!
Hi. I've uh...  I've been saving up for a new Xbox game but... but I think you could use the money a lot more than I could. Listen I, I want you to take this.  It's twenty dollars. 
Hang on.  Hold on a second.  I gues... I... guess... this is... goodbye, Willzy-x.  I'm gonna miss you.  Hey, don't forget me, okay? I won't forget you. 
Uhhh-woo wow! Isn't this great? You guys seeing each other again?
Charlie's right! I'm not gonna let some fake Mr. Hankey spoil my holidays.
Aw, dude, come on. I gotta do my science homework.
But you need to understand: we have a whale here that needs to get back to his family on the moon.
What if we do a show where we-  Uh, no.
Dude, we'll have Chef's $2 million in no time!
Hybrid cars don't cause smugness, people do.  Look, hybrid cars are important. They may even save our planet one day. What you all need to do is just learn to drive hybrids and not be smug about it.
Wait. I don't know if this is cool.
Dude, this book says there could be infinite alternate realities to every reality.
Because- because that's not even entertainment! I mean, it's just, just, rehashing shit, isn't it?? It's like everything these kids are into these days, you know, it's just... rehashed shit!
Can you guys meet me over at Cartman's house tonight at around midnight?
Come on, dude. All you gotta do is eat it very fast!
Cartman, you're supposed to be studying! What the hell is all this?!
Yeah, hey, do you think we'll get in trouble for watching it?
Okay. Here we go.  Hey! That was right on target.
Ih it sure is quiet up here in the mountains and it's dry, too. Do you have a humidi-humidifier?
Oh. Then what the hell are we talking to you for? Come on, guys.  Hi, are you Elton John?
Yeah, but what about all the people getting laid off from the grocery stores?  And what about all the- 
Or if you sold one to an "Eric Cartman"?
If it's on the school network we can track the IP address.  This way. In here.  Whoever it is using the computer in the music room.
Okay, I fed the pigs. Now I definitely should water some fields... Oh wow, cool. That Jewish kid put up a sign on my farm. "Hey Kyle, really like your farm." Oh awesome!  What the hell is that? Stan? 
I'm going to break everything that you own! 
Dude, we have to get to the mall!!
No, dude, if something happens to him, my parents are gonna blame me.
You've got the best balls in the whole world, Chef.
I can't wait to get out of school and get our Teiko sports watch.
Wow, I guess this really is a big deal.
Look. You guys built a machine together that can bend time. If you'll just agree with him, you can build another one and usher in a whole new era of science!
They didn't believe me. They thought I was pitching a movie.
Yeah, maybe starting a detective club isn't such a bright idea.
I can't watch the meteor shower with you, Kenny. I have to go to Jewbilee.
Wwait, what do you mean? Stan's in danger?
Guys, stop, stop!  We don't have to do this!
And Stan for being in love with Wendy.
No no, it's n-it's not like it sounds. Here, check it out.  See look, we just video the babies fighting over a ball full of crack. It's really getting popular!  I mean it, it's cool because like the commercial said, the crack babies had nothing before.  It, it's great, because everyone wins, you know? You see that? Two million hits.  Did you know they're putting bacon inside of pancakes at Denny's?
We got six days to make it to Los Angeles. If we keep our stops to a minimum, we should be able to get the episode pulled just in time.
Hey!  Faith Hilling is not out of style, alright?
No way dude. I'm gonna win the costume contest with this sweet Chewbacca costume.
What the hell does that have to do with American history?
Oh, my God! What the hell is that thing?! 
If we're playing outside he shows up completely wasted and, and screaming how the government is following 'im.
You're not copying my homework, you lazy turd.
I believe that you're a broke, ignorant idiot!
I don't think Mr. Jefferson pays enough attention to his son to notice. Come on! 
Cartman! What kind of stupid-ass question is that?! Of course it was fun!
Because they're an addictive solution to a greater problem, causing disease of both body and mind with consequences far outweighing their supposed benefits.
Go on and go home, you fat chicken!
Not your dad, Cartman! What's your dad got to do with this?!
Dude, I can't believe we are dealing with this Muhammad thing again.
Dude, when he gets out he's gonna be really mad!
Yeah, I noticed that too. Let's go get some ice-cold lemonade.
That isn't my idea! I saw a bus in a garage a couple of blocks back! We need to modify it!
This is not a woman! It is a succubus!
But this video game can make a million dollars. We have to give the crack babies a piece of that.
If we can go in, and get the GameSphere in 30 minutes, we could still be back at your house playing video games by midnight!
This is ridiculous! Just because they say it on TV it's alright.
I know, I know. Well, look: I'll stay over anyway so I can play for... eighteen hours, and then I'll go to the lake. 
You don't get it, Stan! I can play here all I want. I even get free Frescas. I don't need you anymore! 
You dumbass, Cartman! Now they're gonna go squeeze his balls!
Yeah, and he was out sick yesterday too. Guys...  I think Kenny isn't here because he's at home cheesing.
Yeah, they're almost as big as his mom's. 
He catches the feesh so, then he can make money.
I don't know, but at least from now on, every time we look at the moon, we can know that Willzy-x is up there, dancing with the other zypods in his castle.
Jesus, man, those Earth Day people don't screw around!
We're, we're in trouble. We're in sooo much trouble.
Ass full of pork fat
jiggles like a Jello mold.
Mouth is flapping, too.
Tomorrow's trial, Everyone vs. Everyone, is gonna make things a lot worse! We have to stop it!
Dude, we've gotta hurry home! The final episode of Lost is on soon. 
I don't think they're going to be able to get all of you in frame Cartman.
I just had a couple more questions about-
We went to a bunch of rock stars and sold them candy bars to raise the money you needed.
Yeah. Clearly Annie Nelson is the hottest girl at our school. Look at those eyes!
Ex-cuse me?! If my little brother has been getting some athlete's hormones, then who has been getting Ike's medication?!
...I can't even get her to understand. It's like she's from another planet.
Uh alright, sorry kid. Gue- guess we have the wrong house.
He was with us at dinner. Wait. Was he with us at dinner?
Do the right thing. Show Mohammad.  Do. The right. Thing.
It's okay. Everyone, it's okay. Perhaps one day, you will all understand. What I do, I do because I care about each and every one of you. 
I can hide it!  Nobody ever has to know!  I can't ever let anybody know!
I guess you should leave police work to the professionals, huh, Cartman?
Ah-ah-ah-are wooden desks all that available? I usually prefer the plastic ones because these give me splinters.
Sir, we are really worried about our friend Clyde. Everywhere he goes people are telling him he had blood on his wiener.
A big success?! You can't even get Tyler Perry to go back home!
No he didn't kill him, he's still breathing!  Get up!  Get UP! 
It's okay. You don't have to feel alone anymore. 
Yeah, he wanted adventure! Not a bunch of ridiculous bullcrap! Right Chef?  Chef?
I don't know if that's gonna be too easy. 
Dude, everyone's trying to figure out who you are.
What do you mean? We're learning all kinds of cool stuff.
Oh. Good idea, Phillip. Let's look for treasuh.
Did you hear that, dude? We still get $3000. That's enough for you to do your DNA test.
Don't hurt anybody, sir. We could try and fix this.
I can't wait to watch Terrance & Phillip with Bebe.
I told you Cartman, I'm not one of them! I don't wanna live in West Jersey any more than you do!
Hey, fatass! Instead of laying in bed eating, why don't you come and help?!
Yeah, I think they already moved in. I saw moving vans in their driveway two days ago.
Come on, dude, somebody needs to wipe that fuckin' smirk off his face!
Nobody else is going to help him, you guys. We've got a chance to do something pretty special here. Are you with us?
...You put Kenny's picture on a milk carton??
But I can't wait to be an adult to be happy. That's forever from now.
Do you know what those kids are going to do to you?! A little middle-class white boy telling them what to do? They are going to fucking murder you! 
I only got a jar of gefilte fish.
There's no Jews in San Francisco, you retard!
Yes, yes, hello? Is this Mr. Su-gi-yama with the Japanese space program?  How much to take a whale into space?  Nu-no, we don't want you to eat the whale, we want you to send it to the moon. How much? Jesus Christ! Uh hang on.  Hello? Jimmy, any luck at the Chinese Embassy?
Whoa whoa wait a minute!  This isn't what I signed up for! I like Family Guy. Why do we have to get it off the air forever?
Then stop saying you're not just sure, you're HIV-positive!  This isn't funny, AIDS isn't funny, dying isn't funny, so shut the fuck up!
Oh, so the gallant knight now comes to rescue me from the bowels of mediocrity! Oh, thank you, your royal lordship! 
Because we're not referring to gay people! You can be gay and not be a fag.
Yeah, that's Cave of the Winds. It's a tourist attraction.
Hey. Do you ever think maybe you shouldn't give your son coffee?
If you want to make sure I'm not switching sides, Cartman, you don't have to worry. Stan is wrong.
That wasn't the Mayan apocalypse, you racist idiot!
No! Didn't you guys learn anything? Look, if we make an album, all that's gonna happen is that people are gonna steal our songs for free off the Internet. We won't make a dime!
No! Chef, they've filled your head with lies! Can't you see that??
Hey, Tweek, you got anymore of this stuff?
W-well, 'cause we want all of those fags to get out of town.
Do you know what happened to me this morning, Stan? This morning... I woke up and felt a sharp pain in my ass. I felt down there and, and found this... big sore lump. On my ass, Stan. I couldn't even sit down, so... I, I had to tell my mother, which, which was humiliating. She took me to the doctor, which was more humiliating, a- a- nd he told me. I-I have a hemorrhoid. It's like an infected blood vessel on your ass. I'm nine years old, and I have a hemorrhoid, Stan. I have a hemorrhoid, and, Cartman has his own theme park.
Dude, look at Bebe.  Something seems different about her.
Clyde got $3000 from his mom's life insurance
Dude, the sooner you eat your peas, the sooner you can try to win some of your friends back. Eh ya you need to Bill Clinton this.
Well, maybe we'll get ours soon, too. I'm gonna go and see if I'm bleeding out my ass.
So we were just wondering if we could sue somebody.
What is going on?! Why do you want Britney Spears to die?!
Time for you to get proven wrong, fat boy.
If we as a people choose not to believe that Jesus is the Son of God, then we can still apologize for the brutal way in which he was killed, and take our share of the responsibility for it.
You can't kill all three of us, Cartman!
So get off your fucking scooters and pick them up!
And so they put us in these harnesses and helmets. I th-I think that's when we started realizing, "Oh wow, this is actually pretty dangerous."
Yeah, that leprechauns were real! And the government just declared they AREN'T technically real, so I was right! It's over! I don't have to suck your balls!
Yeah. I guess their rules did have a point. Things have gotten a lot worse in the ten days since they've been gone.
No you didn't, asshole! What you did was totally stupid and racist! And you only did it to screw me over!
He just stacked his Shapeshifter with an Elven Blade!
I think he said he wants to practice on a real bull.
I'll die if I do swim in it!
Dude, this whole building is going to collapse!
I... because the world is at peace. I must endure.
Well dude, how the hell are we supposed to play it, then?
We can't deal with you saying "hella" anymore, Cartman! You're going to the other universe! 
If we win, we can buy a new go-cart that actually runs.
You're gonna see it.  WILL SOMEBODY GET ME A GOD DAMNED CHARGER?
What I understand is that you totally screwed me over!! So why should I have to listen to you?!
Fine. That's it. I give up. Have fun being miserable.
Come on dude, we have to get to practice.
Okay, then let's take him to the hospital. You hear that, fatso!  You're goin' to the hospital!
Aw man, here we go again! Use the Jew as a scapegoat.
Come down here, you stinking aliens!  Uh, uh...
But we actually are busy. Tonight's the big fight.
You mean that you aliens actually enjoy sitting around and watching us fight and kill each other? Dude, that's messed up.
Hey, that's it. Oh, my God, that's totally it!  It's so simple!
Nah, let him make a complete ass out of himself for a little while longer. 
No! It's alright! Just give me some time to work on them. I'll see you guys later. 
Because I-  I... Um... because I think... they are real. It's all real. Think about it. Haven't Luke Skywalker and Santa Claus affected your lives more than most real people in this room? I mean, whether Jesus is real or not, he... he's had a bigger impact on the world than any of us have. And the same could be said of Bugs Bunny and, a-and Superman and Harry Potter. They've changed my life, changed the way I act on the Earth. Doesn't that make them kind of "real." They might be imaginary, but, but they're more important than most of us here. And they're all gonna be around long after we're dead. So in a way, those things are more realer than any of us. 
They're just drunk, Cartman! As soon as they sober up, they'll stop.
Aw man, I don't think it's very safe to be on this bus.
Check it out: Now we're going into the secret underground base.
We're missing out on some quality video game time right now.
Those things are stupid, Cartman. They just stick your hand in cold spaghetti and tell you it's intestines and stuff.
There is a crisis in America! As families grow further and further apart-
Cartman, you're such a fat ass that when you walk down the street people go "God damn it, that's a big fat ass!"
We'll help you look for him after the game Stan.
This fat fuck thinks he's PewDiePie! Because of him I can't get Ike to come out of his room!
It's okay, Ike, you're going to be... okay.
Okay, I'm gonna go grab mine. I have an idea.
It didn't work! My stupid Jew dad won't lend me money for CDs!
Come on, we have to finish the quest in Stonehaven. 
Ladies and gentlemen, my best friend, Mr. Hankey, is getting sick because South Park has become overcrowded with people who eat health food.
Oh. Well, I certainly don't want you to feel that "Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly on the Table" is holding you back. 
I think it went really good. Those people really got into it.
We have in our possession something of great power.  It is... The Lord of the Rings.
We need help! Our friend is in a coma!
But they said we can't charge the front door.
All right. Butters, go get next to her.
Hey guys. You wanna throw the football around?
Write the number down! Write the number down!!
Going to Afghanistan? Locked in a small space for 20 hours? How could things get any worse? 
Hey! What the hell are you doing inside my little brother?!
How are you rich?! Your mom pays for everything!
Wow, you know, Cartman? That is an awesome idea. You should totally go to Somalia.
Our band can't find a stylistic direction to go in. We need to go down to the mall to buy hundreds of CDs to listen to so we can define our sound.
Dude, asshole, you're keeping a lot of other celebrities in purgatory!
Dude, we're totally lost! We're gonna die out here!
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with dreidel I will play
Second verse, same as the first
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidelll-I ma...
That kid and I had a long talk! I told him he was on a slippery slope to becoming a monster like you!
...Mr. Hankey! Hoh, we were so worried! I was waiting up for you and you didn't come, so I thought that-
But I did! Ah, I brought democracy to Cuba!
Mr. Garrison, seriously, I have to go. Can I please be excused from class?
Heeey Ike! Look what I got.  The new Call Of Duty! Do you wanna go downstairs and play?
Holy crap, dude!  Hey look! He's got ice cream! 
You gotta come to Kenny's house with us.
I know, but—why do they have to take it out on us? Why do we have to wait around for them to come back?
It's not lame, it's sweet! After we build this clubhouse, we're gonna get girls to play Truth or Dare!
Do you think we did a good thing, Stan?  I mean, no one even seemed to notice.
You're saging these games do this on purpose?!
Hey, we'd do anything for our bros, man.
Damnit! What the hell is wrong with you, Tweek?!
We spent all afternoon learning about how we aren't actually happy. I had no idea how unhappy I was until today. They gave me this cool book to read, and I'm already on chapter four....
Don't know, but it kicks ass.  Wow, dude, you're the luckiest kid in South Park.
I know. It's probably gonna be the biggest night of our lives!
Me?? Dude, I've been here since the beginning!
The whale's name is Willzy-x, and he told us he's dying on our planet. We've come up wth a plan, but we're gonna need all of your help to make it work.
Could I please one of your piping-hot farts in my mouth?
Chef, CHEF! You need to get out of here before you get arrested, all right?!
Admit you're lying, and I'll let you go.
...Dude, you're supposed to vote for Giant Douche.
What's the matter, Mr. Hankey? Are you sick?
We're sorry, Butters.  Our mind is made up.
Uh, we need to go to Canada. As soon as possible.
But it's okay, Stan, because I finally figured it out. You see, if someone like Cartman can get a million dollars and his own theme park, then there is no God. There's no God, dude.
Ya see Ike? There's nothing. There's nothing for you to be afraid of.
Hey, Stan. Do you know how to play Truth or Dare?
Yeah.  Hey Riley! Try this hamburger.  Cartman made them himself.
You're gonna need to kick more ass than that to beat the Cowboys.
You know what I mean! Why is my little brother watching you talking about us talking about him?!
Mom, Dad, can I go with the guys to see the Raging Pussies?
Officer Barbrady, I would like to reinstate my previous Shenanigans! This whole carnival is a rip-off!
Well, Cartman, thanks to you we don't have any money left to win the Terrance and Phillip dolls!
Tweek. Now there's an interesting choice. Tweek has a lot of qualities that I look for in a friend.
Alright guys, listen up! This may sound a little strange, but, the whale, at the Denver Sea Park, is going to die, unless we get it to the moon,
Like look at him. He's always shaking and nervous.
Jambu! Jambu, why didn't you speak up before?
Hey you guys! You guys are not gonna believe this!
No no, he's right! We've gotta make it for someone in need so that people have to go.
If you guys want there to be a Christmas, you'd better come help me!
If you do not accept treatment I will no longer give you money or be your friend. I will not help you kill yourself.
Listen, doucher! Our parents are gonna kill us, and you, if they found out that we bought these!
Look, we're sorry, you guys, but the balloon just went up in the air and the dude sang a song and we were suddenly there.
Yeah. We have a report to do, asshole! Get up! Get up!! 
Yeah, what's this about? We should be writing our monologues for Smackdown.
It was really about the most man thing I think we've ever been a part of.
...And if you look here, you can see how David Blaine performed the miracle of being frozen in ice at Times Square.
I don't wanna go to your stupid movie premiere!  And don't tape that to my locker!  Oh God. 
Where is Cartman? He said he was gonna bring money for us to buy a pumpkin.
Oh, no thanks. We don't do that stuff.
Yeah, there's this guy named Jack Leborkian that goes around and murders people that ask him to, and he doesn't get in any trouble at all.
Okay okay... I love having Cartman's farts in my tummy. I love it.  I love it sooo sooo much.
Please, just, just leave it alone, Stan. Everything is as it has to be.
Dude, because! You have to stand up for yourself! So will you fight him? 
I want you guys to all meet my friend. 
I don't know about this, guys. I think sleds are dangerous.
Cartman farted in there! We had to breath it in for 20 hours!
She did, but now they're saying we have to start going back to school anyways. It's totally gay.
You don't wash your hands after going to the bathroom!
Well, sorry's not good enough! What are you gonna do about it?
No way! There's no real connection between us. It was all a big lie.
Yeah. How are we supposed to know that pan flute bands would be outlawed?
No. We can't, dude. We have to win the Terrance and Phillip dolls.
Mr. Garrison, since haiku sucks so much ass, could we go to the planetarium again?
So then why do you just ignore it using something as stupid as Chipotaway?
Maybe we should get out first. See if we can find a way out and then come back for him.
So what should we do now? It's Saturday and we have to have as much fun as possible.
Oh no way! Look!  The pan flute band's put in prison, just like what happened. 
You want a fight? Well, that's fine with me!
Princess Kenny, I believe it's time we returned the Wizard's hospitality! 
I have to show you something.  I think it will change the way you feel about your impact here.
There's not gonna be any robot guards, retard! Just get Kenny! 
Is, is this? Do you think this is cool?
Wait a minute. I though your father was your mother 'cause she had a penis.
Come on, you guys! We better get to work! 
Dude, you have to tell everyone. Right now.
...And see? Here's one from Butters. It says, "We can't wait to see you back in school, Kenny." And it has a picture of him and you in a little airplane! 
The Jewish population isn't dying out, fatass! It's growing!
Well, it looks like she's not going to show up, Stan. Let's go look for the visitors now.
How, how long do we have to take the shuttle?
There are greater things at work than what you understand.
Well, do you also do other surgeries like that?
Oh geez. Maybe we let this thing get out of hand. This issue is so complicated, but... m-maybe we sh-should just let Kenny go in peace.
He's gone, dude! Butters says he saw him leave.
Fine!  Then YOU do it, you're so tough!
Dude, I guess we've just got to try it without him.
Red Robin can be rented out, for wedding parties. If we all chip in we can pay for the deposit to have the wedding party there.
Yeah! Like Stan gives a crap if Wendy breaks up!  Stan? 
Well? Now what are we going to do?
Pulling an episode because someone is offended starts a chain reaction. You'll have to pull more and more episodes until the show goes off the air completely. It's what happened to Laverne & Shirley.
But you were just gonna take it out in the backyard and put a bullet in its head!
I wanted to get Ike out of his room, so I invited all his friends over for a slumber party to play Dragon Age: Inquisition.
Well like we said, we didn't know whether or not we should care?
That's it, Stan! I'm not sitting through a whole movie with you! 
How many tickets can we put you down for?
You assholes stole our client! How about some Goddamn business ethics?!
I think Stan might've been right. Anyway, I think it's going too far. I mean, if I kill myself, it's gonna make my family really sad.
Hey, wait a minute. How come Ike's tombstone has the Canadian flag on it?
Please, sir. I came because I don't think Ike belongs here. Family isn't about whose blood you have in you, family is about the people who cared about you and took care of you. We're not the same blood, but I love my little brother. We've taken care of him because he needed us to, and that makes us more family than anything. 
Wait till you guys see my costume! It's gonna be sweet!
Alright, alright! If it means that much to you, take the stupid triangle!
That's it Cartman, I'm outta here!  Chatroulette is no way for me to find new friends! 
Hello?  Excuse me. I'm here to pick up Ike?  Uh, hello? Is Ike here?  Hello? 
Don't, don't act for me, Stan! Really?! Because every minute I'm watching this video become less about awareness and more about you!
"You know he can't think on his own, Kyle!" "Brush and floss, Kyle!" "Where has that finger been, Kyle?"
Dude, dressing up like Hitler is not badass!
Yeah, but it's okay Butters. They have purity rings now.
Don't you think you owe everyone an apology for bringing NAMBLA here?
It's true. We think that word might be plaguing our friend, Kenny.
Well I don't know. You're just the only grownup we trust.
Well, I- guess we'll see you in school tomorrow, Chef.
No you're not, dude! You're a guy in a panda costume! 
Mom, there's sssomething I need to tttell you.
Alright, Cartman. I'm gonna give you... a jail-time card.  You lose a turn.
Let me out of here, kid! Why are you doing this?
Why's your sister so mean to you dude?
I can't. My dad grounded me. Wait a minute, where is my dad?
Is it cold in here? I realize we're in the mountains, but do we have to freeze to death?
We want to talk to who's in charge.
And you don't see a problem with that?
Yeah, I just... well I just thought our company name would be more like uh... or-original
Yeah, but now we think maybe heaven isn't a place you can get to, maybe heaven is just an idea. A frame of mind or, or something gay like that. Maybe heaven... is this moment, right now.
But where are we gonna get the money to buy costumes and and the instruments? 
I'm never gonna win that two tons of candy looking like everybody else!
Here's the control panel that operates all the stars.
But I can't, because, what if thinking about it is the only thing keeping my space-time together? 
Stan, you don't get how cool Facebook has become. You can message your friends, play Yahtzee with your friends, even start your own virtual farm and have your friends visit it.
Butters, you have to tell us what Cartman is up to!
I'm going to try and break you away from the computer, Cartman. I need to remove the CPU.
Yeah. Well, she likes Ike a whole lot.
Do you think kids in every town have to deal with this crap?
Look, the truth is, we all have a bigger problem now, and you know it. Nobody is going to get anything if we don't work together against those thousands of other shoppers.
Well, all my life I felt I was black! I've listened to hip-hop, I watch UPN and I love playing basketball! My body doesn't reflect who I am inside.
Stan, I don't think we're supposed to be in the military base. They might shoot us.
See? There you go again. Look at you dude. Look what you've become.
Which one of us took it?! It was so long ago, I c- I can't remember.
'N Sync, Backstreet Boys, New Kids on the Block. All had five members.
Okay. So we put little "woo" mouths on all our heads.  And then we shoot that for one frame.
Yeah, but Cyborg Bill is totally gay now. Please Mom? Everybody else has Chinpokomon.
Oh dude, check it out. I got a Jake Plummer.
If only we had realized how special our time with his gigantic ass was.
But instead, we should all be treated the same, with the same laws and the same punishments for the same crimes . For in that way Cartman can be freed from prison, and we  will have a chance to win the sledding race on Thursday.
It's so unfair! How can my parents do that to me?!
Well then we're gonna end up freezing his hellish heart with a cool island song.
Yeah, this guy.  Vladimir Stolfsky. He had videos on YouTube of every single rally.
If you really think every kid in America should see your anti-bullying movie, then why don't you put it on the Internet for free?!
Please, tune in and help get America's families back in the living room.
Yeah. I think Phil Collins rocks the house.
No. Then I came into this virtual space.
Wow, I didn't know golf games were this cool.
Wow uh, you think it takes forty dollars to get people to like me.
I know, dude! Let's get the hell out of here! 
That's how God is! And if Pharaoh doesn't give us what we want, next he's gonna kill all Egyptian first born boys!
Yeah, this is starting to look like something we shouldn't be any part of. Let's go play with trucks or something. 
I have to join Jewleeard and make Grandma proud!  Tell my parents I'll call them. 
How hard can it be? Look at it. 
But that's stupid.  How can that replace Faith Hilling? It doesn't even make any sense.
No. We just have to show him that there's other girls out there. I say we take him to Raisins.
Please? I need you to come sit down for a second.  So... Here we all are. Mom, do you want to tell Dad something?  Mom?
Whoa, Cartman. We aren't gonna be hippies anymore. Y-you don't have to kill us.
Uuuh. Well, the truth is, we didn't write that paper last time. 
Come on Stan, don't you even know where you would go?
From public school, your house is just a flicker of light.  Don't you want to go out? All you do is... stay in your house and... study
The past...four nights we've tried to play, he shows up and kills us!
Dude, my brother's in Milan. There's nothing I can do.
Coach! Coach, I'm all better. I'm ready to play.
Goddamnit, don't you get it?! I hate pee! I'm grossed out by pee! The only thing I find more disgusting than pee is bananas!
That is not what happened! You totally started crying and quit the game!
Hey, you scrawny-eyed shithead, what the fuck is wrong with you?! You must be some kind of fucking asshole to be able to ignore a crying child!
That does it! I know what I have to do! 
No, we really want nothing more to do with these people.
Of course, the sewer! That must be where he is. Come on!  Come on!
Knock it off! I don't have your stupid picture!
Shut up Terrance, we can geneti-cal engineer anything we want.
It's my seat ring. I have to sit on it because of my hemorrhoid.  Ow.
Oh my God! What the hell are we gonna do for six hours?
We made it, Ike. You're going to be okay. 
How do you know? You weren't even there.
Comments on commentators, it's all changing so fast.Playing XBox with your brother is... just a thing of the past.
Now with Ma on her iPad, and Dad trending or trying,All the family is scattered, and the living room's dying.
Because it wasn't the outdoors or church or even trips to go ski,
What brought families together most was a good old TV
Now we watch things by ourselves and just tweet what we saw.
And if you try to complain, you get called a-
I'll give you five bucks to eat your puke.
Ike, you'll always be my little brother, okay?
But how can the Jews make it better??
Yeah, you can have a drink of water. The dispenser's over there. 
IT WASN'T MY IDEA, IT WAS YOURS! YOU KILLED KENNY, YOU BASTARD!
You might as well just say Pilgrims and Indians were all aliens who came here and made some kind of intergalactic treaty!
Do you hear that, Stan? It worked! We've shut down the veal industry!  Stan? Stan?? 
Eric, sources are speculating that third-grade student, Pete Thelman , pees sitting down like a girl. We've also got confirmation that Sally Turner  stuffs her bra. And Clyde Donovan has only one testicle.
Stan, this is it. Time to stop feeling sorry for yourself and come home! Everyone cares about you and everyone wants you back!
What the hell is that?  Oh my God. 
That thing is pretty cool. What games did you get with it?
Because I m-I mean I really think you could have done it for about $12.50.
Uch, I didn't think there would actually be a leprechaun! And I still don't! Why would a leprechaun be warning us of a terrorist attack?! There's another explanation for all this.
Your girlfriend doesn't even like you, Stan the Man! She likes me!
Disposing of the doll wouldn't be easy. He would have had to have brought a shovel to decapitate it.
Please you've, you've got to believe me! They've still gotta be here somewhere! Uh we've got to find them!
Mom, Dad, have you ever met Ike's kindergarten teacher? 
Just let it go, dude. You only had sixteen dollars and twelve cents. Count all your losses and move on. He's smarter than you.
The... girls at school. They made a list and voted me the ugliest boy.
Mr. Hankey.  He comes out of the toilet every year and gives presents to everybody who has a lot of fiber in their diet.
I was just explaining how a negative argument doesn't make a po-
Do you think they're gonna pissed at us for lying that they molested us and sending them all to jail for ten days?
Stan! Go get the other guys and tell them to meet me at the bus stop in ten minutes!
Aw man, at least the real Jesus didn't weigh 400 pounds!
When Cartman first opened the door, and saw the Thompsons, he felt bad for playing a joke on them. Now that everything's turned out alright, he's able to laugh.
What was it about? Ih-in case our teacher asks us.
Nobody believes in you, not even my friends.
It's too late for that. Things just can't go back, Stan, uh.  Ah-I'm with Cartman Burger now.
That is the dumbest idea you guys have ever come up with! I'd expect this stupidity out of Cartman, but you, Stan?! Butters needs medical attention right now!
So if you're identical, does that mean you all think alike?
Cartman, there are people in the world who really have Tourette's Syndrome. This isn't funny!
It's what we do in Jew Scouts. Usually we just sit around and make stuff. But tonight, because there's a meteor shower, we're gonna do some big thing out in the woods. It's gonna suck ass, I'm sure.
Who took all the pizza and the cake?  What the hell?
I didn't wanna have to do this.  but if you don't tell us, I'm gonna tell your dad you helped get the wrong person elected President!
Dude, this book says I don't exist unless I think I do. But what if I don't?
Dude, did your dad know that the show was being broadcast live?
I hate being small and Jewish. I feel like a tall black man.
He'll view it as a challenge when he's getting his ass kicked!
I guess there's nothing we can do. Chef likes her more than us.
Please, you guys, you don't understand.  My family is devastated. My mom just walks around the house like a zombie, and my dad can't stop crying.
Yeah. My school teacher wanted to be a woman, and you made him into one.
Let's just get this over with, Cartman. You won the bet, here's ten dollars.
All right, I really don't want to have to do this, but... I'm not happy with the direction this company is taking.
The reason Chef has been saying those terrible things about us is because he's been brainwashed! By this- fruity little club!
We're not letting you back in the band, Cartman! Fuck off!
It's not enough! Ever since Kenny switched sides, there are more kids that wanna go with PS4 on Black Friday.
I guess I didn't realize it was just about the points. 
I think the other dog's the one that's confused.
Damn, you sound pretty sick. Maybe you should go back to the hospital.
I'm gonna buy a Walkman with my half.
Towelie, over the past few months I have watched you go from an ancillary character with a few amusing catchphrases to a dried out spooge rag covered in the jizz of a thousand older men.
(I can't take it! I want out right now!)
He's gotta show up. He's just got to.
Yeah. I guess we gotta try to get into that club, too.
He got a full dose of the stars.
Hey, how do we know if she's pregnant?
Oh well, at least as president you can run the school the way you want.
Meh? Ike, we have a whole day to play XBox! Mom and Dad are leaving!
Yeah. I bet they could make a fake set of balls. Come on, Butters!
Look, let's just get our money from EA Sports and get out of this whole thing once and for all!
Do with us what you will, Mr. Lucas!  But please, don't change Raiders of the Lost Ark.
Is that what this is all about?!  You came up with this whole idea so you could get a stupid toy?! 
Yummy yummy yummy can I please Cartman's farts in my tummy?
No, the nipples are more in the middle, see? 
But right now I'd say if we're gonna have a retard for a friend, I, I have to pick Timmy. Because Timmy doesn't tell any jokes.
Then we'll wait, because we have to clone Muhammad now!
You didn't see a leprechaun, fatass! If you could prove it, I had to suck your balls, but if you couldn't, you had to pay me ten dollars! Pay up!
Don't you think it's a little strange that Cartman keeps asking you to stay over?
Yeah, fatass, this is their famous Mechanic sketch.
Sorry, Mom. I just had to deal with Ike. He-he's been cranky. 
Dude, where in the world can Britney Spears go where nobody will bother her?
What if they don't show the Terrance & Phillip trailer at all? What if we went through all of this for nothing?
Dude, some people really do consider this obscene.
Well... what kind of stuff does she like? Do you know?
Come on, Cartman! You haven't liked anybody else!
Well, you're not gonna last down here either, Mr. Hankey. Now, come on! I'm not gonna let you die!
Hey guys. Guys! Hold up.  Hey uhm, you're kind of friends with that Nichole girl, right?
Come on! Everything's gonna be okay!  Sir! Sir!
Congratulations, sister. You have heard the noble truth and are now a Blaintologist.
If we take him to the hospital, they're gonna find out what happened.
Hold it.  Pops, I've got the music inside me. It's in my soul. And I know my place is up on that stage. I'm gonna make it to the top. And I just want your blessing, Pops.
Come on, Nurse Token. We're gonna play football, you puss.
Stan, don't you think this has gone far enough? Is it really that big a deal?  Yeah, just vote. For Giant Douche.
Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo
he loves me and I love y-
But if the tape must be brought to the House of Butters, who else can do it?
Now she's doomed to walk the earth in limbo. 
Cartman, you are hereby declared a full-fledged retard!
Until we get people to stop downloading music for free, I say we refuse to play!
Don't worry, dude. That little truck just runs on D batteries. It's gonna run out of juice soon. 
No dude, screw that! Jimmy, if Cartman didn't write the joke, then definitely don't sign any patent papers with him! Just say "Cartman, you didn't have anything to do with this joke and you know it!"
We've gotta do something, Chef. If we don't we don't stop that network,  "shit" will become an even more acceptable word!
What do you mean, "there's no tooth fairy?"
Aww, come on, you guys! It's supposed to be really cool.
What the hell did you do that for, Kenny?!
What is happening to our living rooms? There is a crisis in America, and-
Oh no. Nohoho no. Cartman, don;t you do this! The Middle East is finally at peace!
Um... so...  So dual citizenship, wow, uh... You know that I, I never knew anyone that had that.
You guys, we can't let him do this!
What are you doing with cats in your attic, fatass?!
Don't call Mr. Blaine a gaywad! He's a brilliant man.
Then I was right. Job has all his children killed, and Michael Bay gets to keep making movies. There isn't a God.
Ike! You are no longer to watch that stupid little YouTube blogging asshole! Do you understand?! You damn kids following these YouTube commentators is bad enough, but i will not have them invading my living room!
They said we have to give them money that we make on the Internet.
These people aren't going to prove anything. To believe any of this you either have to be a liar, or stupid.
It was just thirty minutes of two women queefing on people!
You made us pull you to safety because you ate treasure?! You son of a bitch!
Dude, screw this! I don't wanna see anymore!
Ot- Nice to meet you, Cartman. Yuh you know, I saw that same jacket you're wearing at Bosco's for $29.95. How much was yours? Um, I juh- I was just wondering if Bosco's is a ripoff?
Trent Boyett will do it. He's the toughest, baddest kid in preschool! 
But where have you been? Things aren't the same without you. Nobody seems to have the Christmas spirit.
That's not what I meant by doing something about it, Cartman!
Wait a minute, that thing landed on Kenny, and they took him to the mortuary.
Of course it smells like ass, retard. It's a sewer! 
You guys, we can't give up on our dreams now! As soon as this strike ends, we're gonna be the biggest band ever!
Okay, fine, I will!  H-wait a minute! I don't even want one copy of Time Cop! 
We don't have a choice, dude. That guy killed our characters 14 times.
Yeah, maybe that just kind of what they do naturally.
Hey, that might work. But it can't be a party for us.
But now let me tweet this for you all to comment upon.
The more connected we get, the more alone we become.If you want change like I do, and feel the same gloom,Then please follow THIS trend, #savethelivingroom
Then that's it. I'm... I'm never going to get my brother back. 
All right, all right!  Dude, what is the matter with you?
Dah.  Does that mean you'll go to the dance?
Well, she's not here! That's just great! Thanks a lot, Stan! You're gonna get me busted again!
Calm down Butters! The men are taking action. But we need to take your picture.
Wow Cartman, the visitors dropped you off just in time to go to school.
We're not basing research for our report on this crap!
Hey wait. I think maybe I have Attention Diffunction Disorder.
Ike, I didn't tell on you, you got busted by the hallway monitor.  Okay, okay. I did have something to do with it. But someday you're gonna realize it was for the best.
You yourself led the campaign against the colorization of films. You understand why films shouldn't be changed.
I don't think Ike wants to go to Squirts.
We're all gonna pitch in on an entry!I'm the whole solar system! The planets even all revolve the right way. That tub of candy is as good as mine!
Hey Stan, now that Terrance & Phillip has been taken off the air, what are we going to do for entertainment?
Hey you guys! Check out my sweet Chinpokomon doll!
Dude, this is probably the best episode they've ever done!
It's crazy, dude! They're saying it's because I agreed to the latest terms and conditions on iTunes!
Oh dude, we are gonna get it now.
Because, retard, you're dumb enough to buy Scott Tenorman's pubes for ten dollars!
Dude, you're just jealous because I'm Chinpoko Master!
Garrison is taking us all on a field trip today. He wants to do the final egg check in front of the Governor's office!
Now, that's what I call a sticky situation. 
What?  You mean the missile defense program?!  Butters, where's Cartman supposed to hand over the ballots?!
Oh for sure, dude! It's the most God-forsaken place on the planet! Things are finally gonna be normal around here.
A hundred thousand for a picture of Britney peeing on a ladybug. Imagine what a photo of her crapping on a squirrel is worth!
Uh, Timmy, if we back to the other kids with that turkey they're gonna be pissed!
Because! Everyone is suing everyone else, and you're pretty much the cause of it all!
I didn't come here to talk about The Passion, Cartman!
All I wanted was to play one level of Call of Duty and you know what Ike told me? He said the living room was for old people.
Excuse me, but Ike has homework he's supposed to be doing.
Jambu! Jambu, I'm back!  How are you feeling?  Huhm. Jambu, you wanna talk about rocket ships?  Ja- Jambu? Are you still feelin' lonely here?
That's not true, fatass! I have red hair, and I don't have to avoid the sun!
Well, I've gotta go start our animation. We've only got two days. 
Uh I'm trying, Mr. Mackey, I really am.
Check it out, dude. The camera shoots one frame at a time. So, all we gotta do, is put the right mouth on, according to what syllable they're pronouncing at that frame.
It's too much power. For anybody. Stan's right. It has to be destroyed.
Look, Stan, we're really getting concerned about this cult that you're getting into.
Mr-&#160;! Goddammit. Here, come on. We need to clean that up. 
All right, fine! We don't need you, Butters!
I'm gonna make a new costume during recess. I can still win that candy.
You're having nightmares about the ending to World War Z again?
'K, so then get on Facebook and fertilize my crops?
Yeah, we've shown them amusement parks and malls. How can you expect them to go back now??
All right! We're getting the hell out of here! 
I have an idea.  I don't like it, but I think it's the only choice we have.
You unbelievable son of a bitch. You never cared about the Muslim religion. Or the safety of people in America. You just want Family Guy off the air!
But I'll get snow on my gloves and then it will melt and I'll have wet hands.
I think we can piece this case together now.
The outside of the device seems to be covered in numerals. Inside are colors... which must open up to some sort of temporal time warp.
Yummy yummy I want your farts in my tummy.
You'd better!  Dad, can't we talk to this new Canadian Prime Minister? Iif he knew the situation, he might e-
No, I mean, this is impossible, Stan! Cartman is the biggest asshole in the world! How is it that God gives him a million dollars?
If you didn't eat so much, you wouldn't have diarrhea all the time, fatass!
Dude, you need to snap out of this! So Wendy left you for Token. What are you gonna do? Just be miserable your whole life?
Yeah! All you have to do is fart some more, Cartman, and the visitors are sure to come!
Well, I don't know...  and I'll bet Cartman doesn't know either!
Dude, an awards show just for comedy sounds like a bad idea.
Dammit! Son of a bitch, dammit!  Oh, sorry.
Ike, you need to have a life. Have fun. Then ruin it by having a serious relationship. 
Yeah, this life is short. The afterlife is forever.
What's this about you going on live television on Saturday?!
No, you're fat to begin with, chubby! Now you're Texan too!
You sonofabitch, Cartman!  You don't fart when you're locked in a small space with other people! 
What the hell have you gotten me into?!
Hey Cartman, I need to talk to you.
Phil Collins is playing Lalapalala's, and because we're all doing so well in school now, our parents said they would take us.
No- Dude, Gorak is cool because it's original. And besides, you found him.
Geez, all that from a stupid video show.
Why the hell would they want that anyway?  Episode I sucked balls.
Dude, we've been working this case since two-thirty!
Stan! You've got to help us become good Christians. Please.
And then we won't have to show anybody the picture Kenny has of you guys sucking each other's jagons.
You did it, Mr. Hankey. You brought back the spirit of Christmas!
Nah. Dude, I c-I can't go to have a birthday party while Butters is missing.
Alright, Cartman! What's so important you had to pull us away from lighting cow crap on fire?!
Cartman?  He's not gonna open it. Break it down.
Why don't you take it to one of those pawn places? Every two blocks you see a guy with a sign that says "Cash For Gold and Jewelry." There must be a lot of people doin' it.
Hold tight, buddy. We're gonna find a cure for you. 
Fatass Cartman was
not on the school bus today.
What a big, fat turd.
Well, we've got something to tell you about Veronica, Chef!
Oh my God... their pitcher was able to hit him right on the bat.
Yes. There's a Russian guy named Vladimir Stolfsky who's got search engine hits all over this thing.
It's perfect! I could take her to a basketball game.  Man I I don't know what's happenin', but... it seems like all the girls are... kind of into me lately. 
Because I saw you. Okay? In your room, passed out, with a VR headset on. Customer Service said that one of us needed to put on the headset and come get you, and that's why I'm here.
Just stop it! That's enough! You aren't reading another sentence of your stupid story!
Uh, sir, d'I have a lot of homework to do tonight and I was-
Oh, bu- but isn't the cold air making the ball really hard? Ih-it's gonna hurt my hands.
The odds on a single number in roulette are thirty-five to one.  That means, with a ten thousand dollar bet, you win three hundred and fifty thousand.
We're thinking that a lot of people in town starting too... 
Dude! I almost thought those Afghani kids talked you into not liking America.
That's it.  That's how our parents broke the passcode. I never thought anyone would stoop so low!
Yeah dude, like, full-on. Ike saw everything. It totally makes sense now. My mom's been ordering all kinds of stuff from Amazon lately. Sometimes, sh-she doesn't even remember what she's ordered. She's probably been having sex with the UPS man for a long time.
When Towelie is doing heroin, he doesn't care about anything.
Yeah... You know, it seems like something's still not right. 
Look, we're just trying to show you there's other girls out there.
Ugh. Can't you see this is my dream?? Music is my life!
Ohhh, no you don't. That isn't gonna work on me, Canadian!
Wait, what are you taking Stan's blood for?
Hey! Hey!  Who the hell told you to put this thing back up?!
That's it!  You're not getting high again until we have our Okama GameSphere back!
Stan, there was never anything between Wendy and I.  I wouldn't go out with my best friend's ex-girlfriend.
Hey Stan, did you see that rainbow this morning?
There aren't gonna be new shows! Don't you get it?! Terrance and Phillip are Canadian! We have to get Canada to end this strike!
Jimmy, exactly what part of the fishsticks joke did Cartman write?
A-ah! A-a-ah! Wha? Where...? Oh. Oh dude. Oh, it was just a dream. It was all just a crazy dream. Huh, oh my God. 
Ah I was just trying to... just, just in one instance... No. No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
We need some more fur.  I think that's good.
Yeah, yeah, that's cool. Bring the left titty out some more.  Yeah, yeah freeze there. 
Cartman is trying to bring Christmas to Iraq.
Wait. You guys, I have an awesome idea! We should secretly go around and tell all the students we can, to not check any of the mascots on this election sheet, and instead write in "Giant Douche."
They saw us on the tour.  Dude, where do you keep going, Cartman?
We need you to protect us... from a bully.
Excuse me, is this really what you think she should be doing right now?
Maybe they took it literally when we said we wanted to adopt a kid.  Whoa! That was cool.
What?? "A-ight"'s not cool, either? When did that happen?
Well good for them. They shouldn't! The writers are standing up and saying they aren't going to be intimidated!
I am taking it personally because Cartman is a retard! Just because he hit his head and went into a coma doesn't mean he's a- Wait, that's it. If I want people to listen to me, I just have to be as stupid as Cartman.
Kenny's not really my friend, Ma. I don't give a rat's ass about him.
It wouldn't be funny if that Web site posted something about you!
You sent us over to Kenny's house on purpose! You wanted us to get sick!
He purposely infected me with his HIV virus!
Hey, uh- we were all just talkin' about how when you get better, we're all gonna go down to Stark's Pond again and go camping. Huh, Stan?
Wait. That's it. Atonement. Of course.  I know what I have to do now. Thank you, Father. 
All right. Thanks for your help, dudes.  Well, we did it, guys. It wasn't easy, but... we did a really amazing thing.
My name is Kyle Broflovski. My friend was raped last Memorial Day weekend. And, and I  I'm gonna help prosecute the men responsible.
Well I wish I didn't have any parents! 
Cartman, how stupid are you?! Didn't you read the Bible? We have to leave you up there until you die, and then you come back to life in three days.
See? We're just watching cartoons, like always. Nothing's changed.
Look, I know it isn't exactly what we wanted, but maybe we can train it.
God dammit, Cartman! You can't keep making up new powers!
Yeah. I think we should get the hell out of here.
She had a contract with us first! We own her!
Oh c-come on, that can't be why they're all here. There has to be another reason.
I can't take it anymore.  Why do people say "long story short"? They're not making it short, Stan.
Yeah. We've come to complain. We don't want a Wall-Mart in our town.
Dad, if the school has to pay you and Cartman $1.3 million, where does that money come from?
Bebe, I thought we were going to watch Terrance & Phillip today.
Don't you remember? That time we were out hunting with your uncle Jimbo and Ned.
If you want your share of the money, then you're gonna shovel snow like the rest of us!
No, dude. They only changed "terrorist" to "hippie" to make E.T. more P.C.
I got some sound advice... from an old friend. 
Stan, do you pick giant douche or turd sandwich?
Mr. Hat, may I please be excused from class?
Yes. My name is Kyle Broflovski. Can you tell me if I purchased an Oculus Rift headset there?
We need to genetically engineer our pig and an elephant, but their genes won't splice.
Get out of here, Cartman, we're eating dinner!
How is it that Ms. Ellen was suddenly arrested for being an Iraq-
Okay, so now you'll help us take care of Trent Boyett?
Chef, there's a new kid in school, and he's a total weirdo freak.
But it's not fair! We have to do a full report on the Founding Fathers, and Cartman got out of helping us again!
There he is! Now, don't let him know we think he's a loser, or else he won't play. 
I'll never forget you. You were my best friend after Stan.
This is terrible, dude! Maury Povich parades these poor people around on his show like carnival freaks! And then gives them prizes at the end after they joked about it. What a dick!
Ah, I thought we were speaking for the children.
Well, actually, Cartman's getting a nurection. But then, we're gonna give it you. Sooo, buck up! 
Oh my God, you're right! You're totally right!! EVERYONE! GET A NEW TREND GOING! FAST! #webelieveinyou!
Well, guys, I guess we're going to Canada.
Yyeah, except maybe it's not perfectly great, because to some degree, Ike and Ms. Stevenson are having an-.
Kinda like Cartman's dad shipped out on him.
Yeah. It just proves we need to learn not to profile one race of people. Because, actually, most of the world hates us.
Copy, Fox trot, let's fly in the goods Tango.
They kind of look like us.  I mean, Stan's got blue eyes and I've got a sharper nose, but I mean, they kinda look like us.
You know, you used to sit in the living room with your friends and family, and THEY were the ones commenting on whatever was on TV.
Hi. My name's Kyle. Uh, I understand that your country flies people into space for money.
Bye-bye seeme mama.  Ah, I'm gonna take him up to the bathroom to get washed up. 
Oh. Well, come on, we're playing L.A. Noire.
Yeah, this church kicks a-- Eh... I-it kicks!
Try it.  We'll see you in a while, we got to go get Cartman's pig.
Oh, my ears feel like they're frozen off, and I think I have a hemorrhoid from sitting on the sled for so long.
Here! Here! Look at this. It says "The succubus enchants its victim with an eerie melody. This is the Succubi power. Only playing this melody backwards can vanquish the succubus power."
Oh God! Oh God! I have to tell the truth!  Mooooomm! 
All these people are going to be gaming on XBox. You really wanna just game with Craig the rest of your life?
We only have one option. I've gotta take you to the surface.
Okay, it's third down. And now, somebody make a play!
I didn't "bail," I got picked up by the government!
We-ull, some fish would be great if it isn't too much trouble.
Cartman, Cartman! I heard that Stan somehow found out about our plan!
(I need some help! I can't take it!)
Look, Cartman, I don't know what's gotten into you, but... I I think it's pretty amazing. And I think it's real. You have to understand why I didn't believe you before.
Well, Ike. You can tell Cartman that it's my triangle!
Yeah well, I can't really afford to play anymore anyway. I'm about out of quarters.
Did you make it to your job interview?
Would you stop scaring everyone with your dumb ass myth!
I don't know. We just have to get it to town and let them figure out what to do with it.
Dude! Dude okay! Stop! I'm sorry!  Says that you are currently... hosting an online chat party for all your friends.
Stan, if I didn't know you better, I would almost think you're doing this because you wanna play with girls.
Hey, it's a fire. That means there must be people. 
It's Mr. Hankey! He hasn't shown up yet.
Go ahead. We don't wanna be in their stupid commercial.
Hoh Gohod, I popped it!! Oh hit huhurts!!
Yeah, look what you're doing to this poor kid.
Hey, yeah! He and Ned do that stupid TV show.
We could go to the city pool. They have a water slide
But why? If they're hungry and poor, why don't we just always give them half of our food?
Ehheh, Cartman, what the hell are you doing?
Dude, I don't think 8-year olds are supposed to take hormones.
Oh dude! Dude, this is the part I was talking about. Check out the bassline on this! 
Y-yeah, but… the color of someone's skin doesn't matter.
Well just hurry, Butters. You can probably make it back in time before the first commercial break.
Dude, I can't deal with Wall-Mart right now. My parents had me there for three hours last night. 
Do you think we can still make it in time?
Ike, Ike, you have to be honest. Am I ugly, yes or no?  You ALL think I'm ugly. Jesus Christ, the least you could have done is told me!
I'm not being in any  faggy boy band!
Hey. Me and Cartman and Kenny are going down to Happy Burger. Do you wanna come?
Don't let him touch you! You die if he touches you!
Oh, you're just saying that because he brings you candy.
City of Brentwood
They take really good care
of all their homeless
We won't let it happen again, Mr. Mackey, m'kay? 
Hey, why don't we watch some of those porno movie thingies?
Dreidel dreidel dreidel,
I made you out of clay,
Dreidel dreidel dreidel--
You wanna kill me?! Fine!  I can't live like this anymore! Go ahead! Do it! 
Yeah, but he's some kind of genius, so he's getting advanced placement in kindergarten.
In there! Let's go!  Get this jamb on the door! 
Dude, this is great! You know all the Stations of the Cross, right, Stan?
Ask Jeeves? Nobody uses Ask Jeeves! Just Google-search it!
He's a talking piece of poo that lives in the sewer. But now he's getting sick because his egosystem is all out of whack because of all the extra poo in the sewer. If you don't all leave and go home soon, Mr. Hankey's gonna die. He's one of my best friends in the whole wide worldeh, and I don't want him to die. 
I can't believe I let you scare me into taking your side. You used fear to make me stop believing in free speech.
Okay. Okay, the shot is finally set up. Now shoot the O mouth for two frames. 
I went online posing as a boy who would have sex with older men, and told them to meet me here. My plan worked perfectly!  Whoa.
THIS is the reason why our living rooms are dying!
Hey! Let's pour them in the teacher's coffee tomorrow morning.
Oh my God, this book says that negative and positive are the same thing; that real and not real are one.
Dad, I think Ike is starving to death. 
...Oh, and I hope one day to be an investment banker.
All right, fine, Cartman! You really want me to go in there, I'll...  Dude, Cartman, what is that behind you?
I got it! I got it! According to PayPal, the Russian guys are just hired mercenaries who had ads up on Craig's List and got paid through eBay so that Boston could be attacked by... the British.
Wait. No wait a minute! I've got it. I've totally got it!
So how'd your date with Ms. Ellen go?
I'm just trying to fit in, Daddy. Don't be such a drama queen! 
What? Y-you gotta vote, dude. Haven't you seen the Rock the Vote stuff or, or Puff Daddy's Vote or Die?!
We can't tell our parents, dude! We lied to everybody! Nobody knows we're responsible for Ms. Claridge's accident!
Why did they search us? That marijawana never even made it to us.
Mine neither. But I double-checked, and Cartman was right. Your period is the start of puberty.
I knew it! Don't let that fat turd walk all over you, Jimmy! Stand up for yourself!
All we wanna know is, who has our Okama GameSphere?
Sir, we would love to sign your wife.
Okay. Okay, you're right.  Oh uh Cartman: thanks.  Cartman?  What the hell? 
We believe that films are pieces of art that must be preserved from the perverse hands of their agent filmmakers..
Hell no! I'm not being part of a four-member boy band! We'll look stupid!
You know what? I'll bet it was you!
Rotten, they're both really drunk, but the won't have sex.
I know that I often have serious moral objections to the things that you do, but... this time I think you really need to reconsider, because if you do this, I believe you will go to hell. So I feel it is my responsibility, as your friend, to tell people what you're doing, and to put a stop to it!
They're evil! I WISH I DIDN'T HAVE ANY PARENTS!
There. Did you see? He just flipped you off.
You've always been a dick to me, Cartman, and I'm not inviting you. 
Wow, look at all these people playing right now.
No, Ike! You can't come to school with me. 
Please, sir. I traveled a long way to get here. He's the only person who can help me.
"No, no, please! This time I swear I won't make albums or movies."
We didn't say nothin' about no kids, man!
Hey Blanket. Uh, look, we're goin' over to help my dad chop wood. You... wanna come with?
My company was on Kickstarter too! Why would I get rid of it?!
Cool. Thanks, Jimmy, well, I'll check it out.
Judas Priest.  Wow! Downloading music for free is awesome! 
We can't get out! The flames are too big!
Okay, Ike. You're my little brother, so I have to show you how to celebrate Hanukkah.  This is called a dreidel. You spin it and see where it lands. And you sing this song:
I have a little dreidel; I made it out of clay.
And when it's dry and ready, with dreidel I shall play. Oh,
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay.
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with dreidel I shall play.
Throw the ball, you stupid frog!  God-damn, maybe if you didn't eat all those croissants,  you'd be able to-- Ow! 
I think Clyde is kind of cool, but Craig is definitely cooler than Clyde.
Uh where should I sit? There's no place to sit down here.
Ha! Our bet was that you would get a platinum album, not a myrrh album! I don't owe you anything, fat boy!
Okay. But you've gotta promise to not complain.
Damn! I thought fourth grade was gonna be different.
Yeah, I don't know what to do with it, though. Well, see ya.
Dude, that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with dreidel I shall play.
We have great news! Our friend has lost forty pounds eating your City Wok food. Here's the before and after photos.
Dude. I don't think I wanna be a part of this anymore.
Nah, I can't. We should help look for him.
But, everyone thinks I was responsible for 9/11.
Kenny, we know you really like this girl, but...
There's no way we can go all the way back. We'll never make it now!
Why? Why do I have to accept it when I can change it?
Will you stop it with that?! What part of this is funny to you?!
I didn't do anything to you. Timmy saw the turkey and wanted to get it. What do you want me to say to him?
You'll never turn ME into a metrosexual! I like being a dirty, filthy little boy!
It's all right. He can't kill us unless we agree to duel. 
Okay, it says here the operation begins with a one-inch incision in the ab-do-men on the left side just above the hip.
Dude, our town is going to be better without the-  What the?
No. I cross-referenced his YouTube profile with MySpace, and according to his blog, he's an old-school Communist. So what's he doing at every Clinton rally?
The only way you can cancel it out is to get Butters to put your wiener in his mouth.
God-damnit! Now, what the hell are we gonna do?!
What? Y-you want me to hang out with you?
They're goin' to show the new Terrance & Phillip trailer
I think we can do it, Stan. I've been close to a million a few times by myself.
Yeah, but that sucks, to get your butt kicked by a girl, Stan.
Yeah. And I think I figured out why.
Cartman, stop! You don't know what you're doing!
Yeah, I don't even know if I'm gonna watch it anymore.
No! What we really should do is go to our parents right now and take responsibility for smoking ourselves. Even if it means getting grounded.
You know what I like best about you? You don't say, "hella," like our Cartman does. I swear, if he says that one more time, I'm gonna kill him! 
No. They're not a part of your betrayal?
...But you can't melt ice with a cool song, 'tardheart.
And then Craig was all like, "Tweek is scared o'me. He's a big chicken." And he started doing an impersonation of you being a chicken;  well, everybody in the world saw it!
Dude, I just found out that everybody pees in pools. Why would I go back?
I didn't see he wouldn't be there, either. Look, all we have to do is get them there, right? Once Terrance and Phillip get together again, it'll be like old times.
No, Cartman, we're going in there and splicing Fluffy and my elephant together.
I'll kill you, Triceratops! You made fun of my crippled mother!
Man, I would have loved to seen to seen the look on Trent Boyett's face when all the sixth graders showed up!
Just because two people are the same race doesn't mean they belong together, you fat racist piece of fucking garbage!
You don't need that! Get off of it.
With his power, I can finally make the earth a better place for the Jews!
Mr. Jefferson said we can invite all the kids in town to go play over at their house.
No, Cartman, we can't do it on Raymond again! It has to be on a current event in South Park. Tweek, do you have any ideas?
How... How did this happen?  Mom, Dad? Why are you shopping here?
Goddamnit, you see what happens when you spread this stupid crap, fatass?
Nono, you're right. Somalia is an oasis of treasure and waterfalls. It's totally the pirate's life.
Dude, we have to get rid of our weapons so at least we can try to deny everything.
No it wasn't, fatass! I saw you do it!
Wait! Wait a minute.  What about a logic loop?
Well, why did you pull it out of the trash?
This would have never happened if you would have let Kenny be a princess in the first place!
Heheh, we could make you say whatever we wanted.
Yes, I did! I said from the beginning that you would do this!
Did you guys hear what's going on? There's like four girls at the school now offering to kiss boys for money.
City kids get to go to museums for field trips. We get cow farms.
We'll just have to keep throwing jabs to win the fight.
Jews do NOT carry gold in a little bag around their necks.Cartman! Stop playing around!
Cartman, you need to stop this stupid little game you're playing!
Dude, you can't do this! How can we be the Avengers without Captain America?
No, no, uh I wanna be tall and black.
What the hell would you know you fat sweaty Mongoloid, you never get higher than a 'D'!
Mr. Hankey.  He comes out of the toilet every year and gives presents to everybody who has a lot of fiber in their diet.
That's a retarded idea that won't work. Why are you really doing this?
But... we were so close... I'm sorry, Willzy-x. We tried.
I appreciate what you're trying to do, Mick, but I ain't a charity case yet.
Come on, Marvin! We've gotta get your people to Marklar before the missionaries do!
I was in the bathroom when you were talking to Butters, Cartman!  I know what-
I- I can't do it... I can't do it. I...
Well! I hope it lived up to all the hype! You must feel so much better now!
I'm stoked my cousin is comin' to live with us. It'll be just like having a brother. 
It says you gotta check it for holes or tears.
What the hell is wrong? "Can't find the server" Kickstarter. 
Yeah! So you gotta bust out of here.  So we made you this cake.  There's a ailnay ilefay inside of it.
But that's not fair! You lied to me!
I can't wait until the teacher yells at us this time, and we all tell her to suck our balls!
Okay, here's the one part that really makes no sense to me:  the first time you saw blood stains on your underwear, were you alarmed?
Dude, don't forget: Timmy is the only kid who can play Helen Keller. Don't piss him off.
Now look, Butters, when the girls bring out the future-telling device, pay attention to how it works. Once you know how to operate it, just grab it and get the hell out of there.
We have to find Red and Green Mega Man for Cartman's birthday party.
Why do they have to put this on TV?! 
...and now I have to go home without him and my parents are going to have me killed.
We have reached the Great Pass of Mount Ururalak.
-slashed the bus tires in Arkansas! I said so! I told you the minute that I-  -and I told you that-
I know, hunh? Put your mouth against the glass like this.  Waaaaah! 
Don't worry. We'll do this quick, okay? Just hang on, Mr. Hankey, just hang on!
Mr. Jefferson just seems like he wants to be a kid, not have one.
No, no, no.  We want to make little pot-bellied elephants that people can keep in their houses as pets.
Ah man! I can't keep my eyes open. 
Awwgh! Hey dude, we don't even have enough weight to move.
That can't be. My parents wouldn't lie to me.
But that is what happened! It is! Tell them, Cartman!
I got voted the ugliest boy in the whole class?
Yeah, it was cool, thanks.  Um, so... Is there any way you'd
I can't wait to see him!  He's gonna be so glad we came!
What happened? I thought you were gonna kill yourself.
Why didn't you tell me, Stam? I would've helped.
Then just tell me what Cartman is up to!
Yeah, why don't you go eat some more pork rinds or something, you fat fuck?! 
Yeah. Check it out.  Ready Ike? Kick the baby!
No, I'm not there. I'm at a hospital. I I'm hearing you in my imagination.
Um I think we're just heading deeper into the mountains.
Like you! Maybe you just need to let your hair down. And let's see how you look without those glasses.  Let's just... put those back on. 
Ah, look, Phillip. Everyone in South Park just wants to see your serious side.
Ike, I don't care if you wanna grow up, I just wanna be by your side while you do it.
Oh. Sweet, dude. I don't think we have to do this stupid debate now.  Stan?
Come on, Ike, hurry up!  Where is the next train going?
You're wrong. If my dad says something is real, then it's real!
Because, he kinda like looks like Steve Austin, the $6 million man
It's about time, Kenny! Did you bring the pumpkin?
Come on, Ike! I promise I'll be nice to you from now on!
Oh, so you know what mung means, hunh?
I'm not from Jersey. I was born here.
Everyone is watching everything.  Ike?  Ike, if you can hear me, I'm sorry. I have been a grandpa.  I didn't understand the things you are into and I and I thought you should like the same stuff that I did.  I have to accept that you're gonna have your own things. I just didn't want you to watch HIM. I just... I just wanna be a family again.
Dr. Biber said he can give me a negroplasty so I can finally look the way I've always wanted. He even took my picture and then did computer imaging to show what I would look like after the surgery. 
Nobody wants any of your stuff, you fat bitch!
You won the bet. You were totally accurate about being able to crap out your mouth, and I've just been frustrated because I didn't think of it first. I want you to enjoy that money because... you really impressed me with your insight and... I'm... proud to have you as a friend.
Look, however hard you think it for you, it's a lot harder for him!
Should be the next one. 2778 Mala Vista Drive. Wait, this is City Wok.
You were right. You were right all along. I thought you were just an asshole when you ripped on Jews, but... I didn't know, I... I didn't know.
Cartman was visited by aliens again last night. And now it's like we're living a repeat of a previous day.
Well, that's not really what you say in the commercial.
But it's like eight pages long and they send me a new one like every three weeks! How can they know if I-
Dude, you don't have to be ashamed or anything.
I think you're awesome, Funnybot. Uh, but you can't go around taking everyone else's jobs.
Yeah? Well... maybe you can forget what happened, but I... can't.
Did we?! Maybe we could have stopped them!
Come on, fatass! You shouldn't be eating all that cake anyway!
And if I had just one wish, just one wish in the whole world,
If I had one wish it'd be for Cuba to change.
Because I think that all the Cubans are in pain
All the joy in the world, from sea to shining sea
Doesn't mean a thing if Cubans aren't free
I just can't be very happy, that's certain
Not as long as your Cubans are hurtin' 
Oh, won't you search your soul and find a way to change your mind?
That is my one and only wish.
You can't do what he wants just because he's the one threatening you with violence!
Dude, you don't understand, I'm a Jew. I have a few hang ups about killing Jesus.
Revamp how? The rules are that the fourth grade class has to perform the Helen Keller Story.
But our teacher, Mr. Garrison? He just had his penis made into a vagina. How come?
If she holds his hand in that theater it'll be all over.
Well, YOU don't, because you're a non-caring asshole, Cartman!
So, what do you want to do now?
How? How could the Jews do that to Jesus?
Guys, Ike has gotten worse. I'm really worried about him. He says he's still seeing dead celebrities.
Dude, it's bad enough we have to sit here without you taking a crap every ten minutes!
I didn't suck his balls, all right?! And I'm not going to!
Stan, this has gone too far. People are going to get hurt. What you started is way out of control.
I don't know. Do you know where he is, Marvin? 
Stan, people in Beaverton are still trapped on their roofs. Nobody's helping them because they think they can't go outside.
Don't be stupid, Cartman. Our teacher wouldn't be out lying in the forest waiting to kill us!
You've had that cough a while, Kenny. You okay?
We can't let those sixth graders get their hands on this videotape.
Boy, it looks like you're not welcome anywhere elephant.  See ya. 
We got the money, Mr. Hankey. We're gonna make our animated Christmas card.
I just want a nurection so I can give it to my mom.
Dad, can we go home? All you ever do since you got this car is drive around and show it off! 
But it's... it's not true they... have no souls. 
Well, he has this new teacher's assistant, and uh and they're both... totally gay.
Mister Father!  We have to ask you something.
Where are you going?  Ike, where are you going?
Phil Collins Hill on Saturday! You got it!
Dude! Every time we play Americans vs. Bosnians, you cheat!
Huh? Well we don't really have that much money.
Don't listen to 'em, Cartman! I'm sure it'll work. Go for it. Yaaay, Cartman! Fly, fly, fly!
So I guess this means we get to keep our weapons.
Well, he is. It turns out that the bookmobile driver here was the one making love to chickens.
Nobody's blood is going to jump up in the air!
Kenny, how many of my dad's mints are you gonna eat? Jesus!
K... what if we cover his face with a paper bag?
Both you guys, stop! Please. You're gonna make people hate us more!
Oh come on! It's obvious what happens! I get killed by Santa Claus so that Christmas is saved!
We have to go see Mr. Hankey at the mall, Cartman.
Jesus, dude. W-w-what happened? It's like, something's lowered the bar to the point that nobody feels any shame anymore.
Oh no, dental floss, what will I do?
Well, thanks for everything, you guys. You really helped us see how important parents are.
Dude! What if Cartman really does succeed? And we really do have to be his slaves??
Well what the hell are we gonna do? Dress him up in a princess gown and, and parade him around like the parents on those awful child pageants? 
Dude, when he gets out of Juvenile Hall, he's gonna wanna kill us!
...Yeah, and dressing up and running around at night is faggy anyway.
Heh, don't, don't tell him what it is, dude.
How many ways are there to take it?! It's just a stupid word!
We can't, dude. Not until we find Mr. Hankey. 
Dude, look, we, we just saw all this stuff on History Channel.
You did, dude! You drank his whole body!
Cartman, that's the dumbest thing you've ever said - this week!
We're gonna save our parents before they all kill each other!
Well, a lot of people like Family Guy too! Who are you to decide it shouldn't be on the air?!
Come on, limey, don't be a wuss! Are you just gonna be a little French pig your whole life?
I mean, come on guys, that's pretty cool, right? My little brother is a knight in Canada. 
Nothing. Um , my period is really uuuh...  Uuuh, my period is going swimmingly.
Kenny, all you did after the cat peed in your face was start running around in circles cheering.
Please, I need to talk to the people inside. They can't set off that nuke.
Butters, can't you see this is wrong? You've got little boys all over school spending all their lunch money on kisses. Boys shouldn't be paying for kisses. It's wrong.
Yeah, but, why can't XBox automatically let you pre-order Metal Gear Solid V?
Wow! I had already forgotten how great third grade was.
A woman pooping out her boobs is not good imagery!
Dude, don't kill your mom. That's not cool.
Aren't those the queermos on the Disney Channel?
It wasn't my idea to burn the Wall-Mart down.
She's really taking this grade seriously, Stan. I'm gonna come over so that we can take our egg to school together, all right?
Yeah. I don't remember him saying anything about this.
Hey, come back! We didn't even get to do our play. 
Yes it is a big deal! Why do you think everyone washes their hands after they go to the bathroom?!
So you intended for us to go ziplining all along? Why, Stan?!
How do you know...  that wasn't your therapy? 
Okay, so how do we get my little brother back?
Dude, no wonder terrorists come from places like this! If I grew up here, I'd be pissed off, too!
They didn't play the Terrance & Phillip trailer again!
Oh, Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay.
We're totally screwed!  They took the two best judges away!
What? How the hell do I only have 37 friends?
Well, we'd better get working. Cartman, you go home and call all the pet stores in the phone book.
You were sticking these in your ass, Cartman?!
No.  But I get Channukah presents for eight days.
Be sure to take me to the same hospital!
This copy of Lord of the Rings made the young Butters behave quite awfully.
Whoa Cartman. Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night.
Dude! All those choirs are the same. They don't even really sing. They use prerecorded tapes.
Yeah, it's tough. But it's times like these that... you see what your band is made of. We've gotta fight through the rough times like Journey!
Yeah. And we're sorry for turning Ned into a vegetable.
You bastards! Come back here! Coomme baack!  Damn it, we were so close!
No, no, no! Don't become an angry mob!  The last time we did that we killed Jesus!
Are you saying that Ike has been given regular doses of hormones because of an IntelliLink screwup?!
You son of a bitch! I won't let you win!
Ike, don't do it! There's still so much to live for!  I know you really wanted McCain to win but, but it's going to be okay.  No, that's not true, Ike. The economy could easily stabilize with Obama's plan.  Ike, don't jump! You could really hurt your ankle or something.  Really Ike, that's like five feet off the ground. Don't do it.
'Cause, r-tard, he's Stan from the future. He knows everything Stan knows.
I am picking up carbon-based life forms in Sector C. I believe we will find a village of peaceful aliens over that ridge. 
God damn it!  Wendy, Stan wants to know why you break up. 
Well, I'm sure glad this is all over with. Let's go count our candy.
Yes! I can't help but take some credit for this. I helped convince him to go!
I don't know, dude. It's like everyone's putting pieces together that aren't there.
Is it like a- haunted house or something?
Stan! Stan, what the hell is going on?!
This is where the elders meet. Nobody is allowed to go in there when they're having a meeting.
Yeah, and then Chef pulled up in his car. 
Pot's illegal too, but people still manage to find it. Ever since that first time Kenny cheesed, he hasn't been the same. You've all noticed the change in him. I'll bet Kenny's at home cheesing right now.
Fine,  then we'll shut our cable off altogether!
Oh, thanks.  Dude, that new girl's into me!
We've got to get rid of them.  Nobody should have the kind of power Barbra Streisand wanted! 
It's not a game, you derelict! And this isn't Scotch! It's apple juice! 
Maybe they should project the movies on Cartman's ass. 
I am Tooth Decay. Your teeth shall be mine. With candy and treats I will take-
Chr, what could you possibly have in your room that could change the outcome of the election? 
Well I've been thinking: maybe there's something you've come into contact with that hinders HIV from growing. Do you mind if we just look around?
No, I don't have sand in my vagina! I just think it's a little immature for us to be standing around talking about one dumb word being on TV!
This itches! Give me some of that calamine lotion, Cartman.
Good thing we made those changes to the seating.
No, no, w-we we really did write it. Tell them, Butters.
Don't you guys think this is a little suspicious? We should buy something else so it doesn't look obvious.
I've designed it to be the best place for them to live. A place where they can finally have the care and happiness they deserve. And if you think it's a bad idea, I really don't care!
No. You know what? Screw this! We aren't ugly!
He was very brave. He risked his life so that Mephesto could live.
You did it, Mr. Hankey. You got rid of all the film people!
Hey. Hey, look over there, Stan. That Raisins girl is really cute, huh?  Why don't you say hi to her?  Excuse me? 
Oh, just this really really old lady who wishes she was still only 45. 
The new neighbors that moved in next to Stan's house. Me and Ike saw the mom get a parking ticket, and she called the parking cop "muff cabbage".
Now look! The reason we're in this situation is because people are being stupid! The economy isn't some vengeful being that takes things away from us. The economy is just made up of people, and people have just lost their faith in it.  What people really should be doing is spending more. Spending is fine. People should just go outside. People should just go outside. They should buy the things they need for their friends and family
No, No thanks, that stuff tastes like pee.
Shh, Blanket, we're gonna take you away for a little while, okay? 
Oh no! They ruined my life! I get to kill them first!
You guys, maybe we should come clean right now and tell everyone that it wasn't the tobacco companies that made us want to smoke.
Butters, you don't really believe that, do you?
Yeah. But I have to say, I feel a lot better now.
Dude, I'm telling you. It's crazy. All my little brother wants to do is sit on YouTube watching this PewDiePie play video games. I swear, I don't understand kids these days.
God damn it! I don't want him to jump over more a-
You know, I didn't even get home until 2:30.
Hey. Ms. Crabtree had that little TV, for the trainng video? Maybe we can watch TV on it.
Guantanamo Bay?! We can't go to Guantanamo Bay!
Dude, hold on! This is bullcrap! If they wanna live in our time, then they should learn our language!
Cartman, let me out of this stupid net!!
I mean, what if I'm just part of my parents' reality?
I knew Kenny couldn't fit in that tea pot! 
There can't be that many pet stores in South Park, dude. 
Hey, so... do you wanna be Facebook friends?
All this for a bunch of stupid movies?
Well, I was just digging around, and I was all like, 'dude, I found this triangle' and my friends were like, 'dude' and I was all like 'dude.'
Well, I... kind of gave a homeless guy twenty dollars last night.
All right dude, what the hell has gotten into you?! I don't trust for one second that your sudden concern for the Muslim people is real!
Come on, dude! I can do it! I'm sure!
There. Do you really want that asshole to win?
Uh oh. I guess we shouldn't have made him eat it. 
Buy me out?! What are you saying?! What makes you so high and mighty you can buy me out?!
Will you please take your rally conversation somewhere else?
You have to! Here, have some more mayonnaise. 
I know your family's poor, but you can't just eat an entire bowl of mints for dinner.
...Remember when life used to be simple and cool?
Ookie mouth!  Gross! I can't do it, Ma!
But we've been playing for eight hours. We can't think of anything else to do.
Ahh-d, excuse me, sir, did I hear you say you needed somebody for your show?
This is just startin' to look like another one of those times where it-it's gonna end up with the whole town turning out, it's a big showdown happening, and us havin' to talk about what we learned, and I say we just stop right now, and go play cards or something.
Shhh. Willzy-x, don't say anything. We're gonna bust you out of here.
Then don't eat 14 Egg waffles for lunch, fatass!
You're a fat skank, Mom, and your tits belong in a morgue. 
Because you spent all of our money on those stupid rides, fatass! Now, either you're getting on a bull or I'm gonna break your fuckin' head open!
Uh, nice costume, dude. Who are you supposed to be? Luke Perry?
It was my idea and we're gonna tell everyone to write in "Giant Douche!" It's way funnier!
Mom. Mom. I found out all about this great new magician named David Blaine.
I don't know. I think... we've been given another chance.
This isn't a joke, Cartman! You have to believe me, officer. The outcome of the election depends on it.
Be a good boy? You know all about this?
Whoa, I don't think anyone's been in here for centuries
Yeah, real life is so boring and stupid.
Well, it isn't a guy teacher. It's a woman.
That's okay, we'd rather just go by ourselves.
I don't know where Cartman is. I think something took him away.
Okay, fine. You know what? Let's just get it over with!
Yeah. He was doing their voices and pouring tea for them.
Well yeah, but not if your decision is for Turd Sandwich! What the hell is wrong with you?!
We don't know. They lost all contact with him.
How can you be willing to kill people for a holiday special? What's wrong with you?
David Blaine is doing a big performance in Denver tomorrow night.  We're sure his magic will entertain and astound you!
It's been a week since Ike's been gone, and every day my parents seem worse. I have to try to go to Canada and speak with the new Canadian Prime Minister, but I can't do it alone.
Well all right, we'll see you on Saturday, guys.
He knew he had to take us all home, too, right?
Don't worry. Everything's gonna work out. It always does.
Okay, okay. Stan, you're right. Maybe I let being a martyr go to my head. Just please, let me stay on this path, and, I'll try to be cool about it. Okay? I'm sorry.
I don't think it's gonna be that hard to keep it from breaking. This whole assignment is stupid.
Look at yourself! You've got to lay off the cheese! 
Oh, so big deal, guys! Do you feel better now? Clyde's the best looking kid in the class. And then Token and Stan, and last is Francis, Cartman, and...  Me?
Dude! Our parents sent us over there to get us sick!
But, but we, we learned things, and took up a cause.
This is serious. They've been going out for almost two weeks now.
You guys, I feel kinda bad for that kid.
You need to stop recommending that app to people!
No! All we have to do is not shop at Wall-Mart anymore! If you want it to go away, all it takes is a little self-control and personal responsibility.
Original zombie? Well, how the hell do we know who the original zombie is?!
No! No, I'm not going to Peru! Not Peru! 
I wish that was good enough, but if you censor out Mohammad, then soon you'll have to censor out more.
Wait. I thought you called your planet Marklar.
Nothing. But the guys said if I don't confess my sins and eat crackers, I'm gonna go to hell.
This whole time your TV is in a house with nobody in it?!
But I feel like a basketball player. That's all I wanna do. 
Dude, Mr. Hankey has magic powers. He can do whatever he wants. 
Will somebody just get me to a hospital? I need to get my stomach pumped!
He must have a huge bone in his ass, then. 
Dude! Did you really lose all that weight eating nothing but sub sandwiches?
Cartman, there's something I need to tell you.
Wow, I wish we had a stupidest home video. 
Well, I- I invested in that IT thing, and there was a bailout, so I received a five million dollar bailout clause check, which, which I can use to help my family, so, I- I guess, goodbye, cousin. 
Nuh uh! It's "Whoever denied it, supplied it!"
Yeah. They've kinda killed Kenny -'s look-alike. You bastards!
I can't lose another friend. First Kenny and now Stan? All I'm gonna have left are you two douches. 
I'm sorry Token, I had to tell him. His life is in danger.
The-that's not the right way to look at it, I-
Wow, there's a lot of profiles here. Kyle Broflovski's amazed Stan has so many Facebook friends. Hey, Kyle Broflovski's amazed Isiah is also a Facebook friend of Stan's.
Butters, people can't just go around beating up people who have diabetes! Now whatever your problem is, you just-
Go ahead! People will just download your songs for free on the Internet anyways!
It looks even better than their first movie, huh?
Well, yeah, but what if the grampa wants to die, cause he's really old, and he's just asking for help?
Ohh, right, you're supposed to pull and master-benate your wiener really fast.
It doesn't matter. Because God is going to harden the Pharaoh's heart!
Jesus, I can't do anything.  I'm just a fourth grader going against the entire government.  Uh, hello? Jesus?
Uh-uh-uh what do you mean "they've taken it"? Oh, this isn't happening! This isn't happening!!
They just released part 3 in theaters and it made 80 million opening weekend.
Well, all I can say is, he's better have Nintendo.  Well, here's Kenny's house.
No!  I am NOT letting you go to that television studio and pretend... to care about safety and sensitivity to get a show you don't like off the air!
The new girl liked me, and so you lied to her!
All right, Kenny, let's go!  Kenny?  Kenny!  Don't worry, Kenny. You didn't die for nothing.  We're gonna get Wing back as our client and... and make a ton of money! I swear it to you!
Well, Stan I have to harvest my crops before it's too late.
Hey!  How about Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo?
But we promised the Earth Day people you'd perform.
Wow! I guess Cartman really did take care of them.
You guys don't even make a six-layer burrito!
Throw 'em away!  Dudes, here he comes. Guys, stop coughing. 
Then why did Butters say he helped you sneak into my room last Friday night?! 
Okay, now put one end of the tube a half an inch into the incision. 
But you're lying to people. If they knew that you didn't eat just all the sandwiches you want, you might not be so popular.
I'm sure that would scare the hell out of him, Cartman.
Yeah.  And that means that McGyver is a real person too.
Listen to me: the little boy who convinced you to pull the episode is a bastard child. He only wants you to pull it because he knows it will be the end of Family Guy forever!
Yeeah, you're welcome. I'm sorry I doubted you. And guys, I'm I'm sorry I acted like a know-it-all. 
Even the dumbest lie can have big consequences.
Don't you just feel a little bad for Clyde?
Stan, you can use family love as a weapon against Shelly.  The next time she's gonna kick your ass, just tell her, "Shelly, you're my sister, and I love you."
If they give you something small, will you end the strike?
But why are you making such strange laws??
Hey man, if you're Jewish you get presents for eight days.
Dude, if my mom knew I was in here, I would be in super big trouble.
How can we be passé? We're only in 4th grade.
Llook, I know I'm not the best-looking guy in town, but I I didn't think I was the very ugliest.
All right McNuggets!  Did we pick the right rooster or what?!
And, and hey, if for some reason Butters can't go to Casa Bonita, you can take his place.
You're telling me that every time you guys download an update for iTunes, you read the entire terms and conditions?
Look, guys, we all have to agree on one system.
Yeah. We'll be the "Save Films From Their Own Directors" club
Oh, hey Stan. Where's your best buddy, Gary?
You know what's goin' on. It's Smackdown tonight. Which means we might have to fight each other.
"And as the voluminous corporate automaton bulldozes its way through bantam America...
Dude, they've been doing that for a long time.
Don't fart on your way out; you might make little smoke signals. 
Uh, hi, we want you to end this strike. 
Guys, I think we should bail out of this right now!
Maybe it's better you don't know who your father is, Cartman.
Mister... Jackson, y-you aren't alive. You're in purgatory.
Principal Victoria, there's something you need to know! Cartman's Tourette's isn't real! He's faking!
The judging's almost done. You're gonna make it.  Oh God.  SOMEBODY GET ME A CHARGER!  Hold on Stan! Don't die on us!
Yeah... but doesn't it seem like we got out of the White House pretty easily? I mean, it seems like it would be pretty hard to escape from the White House with everyone chasing you, and we just kind of... ran out. 
Well, then you should. I think that a person has a right to die if they wanna.
So... why would one come to America to warn us about a terrorist attack.
We live. That's what Indy would have wanted. We just try... to live.
Why do they even allow those things in stored?
Oh God!  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to-ah, I'm looking for my brother.  Ike??  What the hell is going on??
Seriously, Cartman. You could make money with these!
There's a Hillary Clinton campaign rally.  Cartman? ...Cartman? 
Let's just stay here and watch the whale swim around some more.
This is it. This one's for the game.
Well how come Kenny's family eats frozen waffles for dinner and has rats on the floor, and we have a big house and lots of food?
You're not getting away with this, you fat turd! 
Butters! He got a ninja star stuck in his eye, and we were taking him to the vet when you fucked it all up! Butters!
Well you should. The poor guy shouldn't be screamed for something that just isn't that big a deal at all. 
Alright, ahhh, why don't we do something else?
Dude, everyone's leaving! We can walk right up to the tank and really study him.
Yeah. You used to sit in the living room with family and friends to hear their commentary on things. Now you can get it with a little guy in a window on the screen. Someone who just comments on stuff. I mean, really? Who would even WANT to do that?! 
No I'm not! God damn it Cartman, you're not gonna kill me off again!
Yeah, now what are we supposed to do?
Well then,  you've got to call the jail right now and tell them that you forgive Cartman for being a dumbass!
Are you sure this is where they said to be?
But we can put our money together with the money you made whoring yourself to all the women. How much did you make?
How did your date with Ms. Ellen go?
Yeah, dude. I told you, we had bread sandwiches for breakfast.
Kenny didn't have the head lice, all right?!  It was me.
I thought you said the wonder of Mother Nature was a beautiful thing.
Yeah. I guess that's the point. I don't think we're gonna understand. Maybe this IS all the beginning of a new art form. YouTube celebrities are only getting bigger. And what's great is that these people are inventing themselves, instead of being marketed and shoved down our throats.
Ike found out last night. My mom's having sex with the UPS man.
Hey, it looks like one of those Etheropians.
I did it! Now I can go to the Raging Pussies!
You just wanna lock me in there because you think I'm one of them.
I know it's hard to think about, but you have to be strong. Remember how that movie made you feel.
Yeah, but dude, he seriously could have died in that fire.
This is when you gotta get mean, Tweek.
Dude, that's not cool. You shouldn't make fun of Christopher Reeve.
Yeah. We're guys, dude. We find something about all our friends to rip on. We made fun of you for being rich just like we make fun of Butters for being wimpy.
From who? We can't ask adults for help and there's nobody tougher than sixth graders.
Whoever it might happen to be, I'm not giving him the opportunity. Tomorrow I'm going to do something. Something I've known I would have to do restore people's faith.
We have to speed this up!  Uh, can we collect our Internet money in front of you, please?
Dude! Just 'cause some stupid North Park kid blew his hands off, we don't get to buy M-80s?
You're trying to confuse me now, aren't you?
You use IntelliLink?? Oh my God! Will you check his records please?
Uh…yeah…we want to crossbreed an elephant with a pig.
Yeah. Cartman's weight was what gave us speed, so we need to find the next-fattest kid besides Cartman. 
Ahh, hi, can we speak to the head guy or something?
I don't know. I feel like I should confront my mom first. But it's so embarrassing.
He said the Muslims beat them here-  God damn it!
I don't know about this guys. I think playing hide and seek in the airport might be dangerous.
Because we keep getting screwed over by your diarrhea!
Wow, dude, check it out! We can win Terrance and Phillip dolls. 
Okay. since my dad's a lawyer, he says we can use any of his books we want.  Who wants to read them? 
Dude, we can't do a presentation on underpants gnomes. Mr. Garrison will fail us because you're making it up.
So then, she's gonna be seeing other people? Is she, sort of, available?
That fat turd up there is the one who set up you and Token 'cause he thinks blacks belong together! 
I just have a feeling this might be the last time we get to do this.
How can you say that? Did you see what we did to their house?! It'll take them days to clean that up!
Doesn't anyone understand the significance of "I'm sorry" anymore?
Yeah! What the hell were we thinking?! Boooooo!
Listen, you don't have to do this! Our imaginations aren't running wild anymore.
Well come on! We gotta tell you what happened. I'm sure glad it's over with. 
Okay, fine, Butters. But if you're gonna hang out with us, you have to play like Lord of the Rings. 
Because Butters isn't a total dick to me!
We just wanna warn you: Eric Cartman, the fourth grader, is goin' tuh try and trick you somehow into getting your wiener bitten off by a pony who lives at Denkins' ranch.
Not if somebody took pictures without her knowing.
See? Look at this. Ike has all his friends over and they're just sitting around on their own computers barely talking to each other. Ike is watching PewDiePie play Dragon Age.
Man. Cartman's more screwed up than I thought.
Kenny was never gonna get his singing right anyway.
All right, but it's gonna take more than one good player to beat the champions, Stan. You'd better have a really good game plan.
Come on, Steve, you're going to Des Moines!
Wait! You know what we should do? We should all take a bunch of cough medicine!
He'd be better used as a coat rack. 
It is not stupid, Kenny! This is my faith and you shouldn't make fun of it!
Dude, what are you talkin' about? That was awesome!
I got 'em! Four tickets, 68th row, to Terrance and Phillip! I waited in line since 3 this morning!
Dude, for the last time, don't call my brother a dildo!
You don't get sucked into it! You don't get sucked in at all! Plehehehehehehehese!
Well I didn't have her do it. She did it on her own.
Yes. His flowing melodies are really enjoyable to us.
It's not me! I'm here to help you, fatass!
They're gonna take The Lord of the Rings from us.
Nancy Kerrigan got the silver, dude. She came in second.
Well, I have this friend, see? And this friend belongs to a certain, Chosen People of Israel. And it... so happens that these chosen people killed your Lord.
Thank you, rabbi.  In 1973, the United States officially issued an apology to the African American community for slavery. In 1956, Germany officially apologized for World War II AND the Holocaust. And now, I believe, in 2004, the Jewish community needs to apologize for the death of Jesus.
Uha, wa, actually, I- I can't eat beef. I have a degenerative problem with my intestinal lining, and beef really gives me gaass.
I'm sorry, Stan. I'm sorry. This whole war has just got us all so screwed up. I just want us to be playing Call of Duty on the right machine.
Oh my God! I killed Kenny! You bastard!
We're not bailing on the party, we're just think there's... more important things right now!
If you knew something, but, you couldn't tell anyone, what... what would you do?
...And in conclusion, the Latino community has provided America, and indeed, the entire world with innovations that we would be lost without. And that is my presentation on the role of Hispanics in American technology. Thank you. 
I told you Tom Brokaw doesn't have a mustache, fatass!
Your husband.  He wanted that pie badly, but he knew that he was not allowed to eat it yet.
You're not supposed to rock, you're supposed to keep the beat!
Come on, hurry. I bet we can get to level 29! 
The Diamond of Pantheos.  She must be powerless now.
What the hell are we going to do??
That's 15 people we got to agree to come see David Blaine perform in Denver.
No, Cartman. You said nobody will have to be grounded. We're not playing dirty!
All you need to know is I'm way awesomer than you think, okay?!
Don't let him touch you! You die if he touches you!
Can't we just play hide and seek at home?
He's a magician named David Blaine, dude. He kicks ass.
Dude, what are we supposed to do? We always just play with fireworks.
But our big game with Lakewood is Saturday!
Look, Stan, I'm finally whole! My dad is even gonna take me back down to the all-star game to see if I can try out for the team again!
Okay, Marvin. Time to take your people to their new home!
"Get ready", "answer the door", Jesus Christ, make up your friggin' mind! 
Um, we... sssort of spend all the money on this... one...
Ugh, okay Stan, what do you wanna do?
Dad.  Dad, Ike and I have been talking, and well, we feel that your new car is changing you.
Dude, nobody gives a crap about who your stupid father is! Muhammad is an important issue with actual ethical ramifications!
Dad? Dad! What the hell are you doing?!
Because then you can pay us to use our friend in commercials.
Well, it's 3:30; I don't see any god-damned underpants gnomes, Tweek.
I guess so. She's, like, his first real girlfriend ever.
This isn't paradise and you know it! The people here are starving and dying! The whole world has used Somalia as a dumping ground for toxic waste. Even the fish here are radioactive!  Cartman, just give me my brother  and let us get out of here!
You're right, Stan. My Grandma isn't floating around, judging me and watching what I do. She's dead. Dead and gone forever.
This place is rad. Look at all the trees and stuff.
Oh God! Look, I know you got Asperger's from the school and I I'm sorry. But your negativity is poison to me!
I know! But that doesn't matter any more! These kids don't wanna play the game, they just wanna watch people on YouTube play it.
I know! It's so much worse than Catcher in the retarded Rye!
Yeah. You used to sit in the living room with family and friends to hear their commentary on things. Now you can get it with a l-
No you're not!  I read the brochure, Cartman! If you're under eighteen, you have to have a parent with you to sign up for the Special Olympics.
Uh Butters didn't show. You wanna go to Casa Bonita with us?
What about Dan Rather? Do you think he's real?
I don't know. Ever since he was in that movie, he got all famous.
Yeah. He doesn't even know that the South loses the Civil War.
Oh yeah. Tom Cruise does have Seaman on his back.
Yeah, you are! You always get in trouble
Hold on. I see.  Oh, Jeezus, this sled is going faaaast.
This is what God told us to do!
Okay, okay, you can have your powers back.
Dude! I've been freaked out this whole time because of that guy's movie?
I was... I was just going to get a drink of water.
Ju-just have a little compassion, huh? I mean, everyone's gone out and bought something stupid. It's not so bad. Whichever of you guys has never bought anything frivolous, go ahead and huck the next squirrel. 
Oh, and what do you know about stem cells?!
Okay, okay, wewe'll switch off. Starvin' Marvin can stay here for a week, then at Stan's, then with me.
Mr. Hankey? Mr. Hankey, is that you? Hello?
Yeah. Boy, am I glad to see you, Ike.
Hello? Will you just give this guy something, please?!
Ike, that is enough! If you're interested in Call of Duty, go play it downstairs in the living room!
Dude, I can't believe they fell for it!
D-hude, this is gonna be so killer. They're all gonna get herpes!
"What I Wanna Be When I Grow Up"?
Then I guess I'll see you on Black Friday.
We're gonna teach that fat bastard a lesson!
It's not cool! Ike isn't old enough to understand.
Don't try and stop me, Stan! This is what my grandma wants!
There's a lot of holes in the Theory of Evolution too; it doesn't mean it's wrong.
No, no, you... you wrote down Turd Sandwich.
That's the most horrible story I've ever heard. Why would God do such a horrible thing to a good person just to prove a point to Satan?
Whoa, dude. The road is really snowy out there.
Elder, It's not my fault. He told me he was Jewish.
Well, that didn't work. What else can we try?
D-ude, I totally miffed that middle part. Did you see that?
Dude! I've never seen Cartman care so much about something.
You're doing the right thing, Stan. Don't you feel like you're a part of something now?
Well, our pig hasn't given birth yet, but she should anytime now.
Oh, you can pretend all you want! You're not fooling anybody!
You just hate smoking, so you use all your money and power to force others to think like you. And that's called fascism, you tubby asshole!
There's four white birds!  This is what Grandma wants? She wants me to attend Jewleeard.
You said you could get us money, Cartman!
And then takes you to Chipotle, and buys you more?
What do you think, Stan. These girls are pretty cute, huh?
Sure. Remember that time that that kid in the red shirt decided to go off on his own?
You mean you can see him?  Ah-I'm not crazy? 
Carman, will you shut up? I'm trying to find out what's going on.
Yeah, huh! You wanna go with us so that later you go, "Haha, I was working for Wall-Mart all along" or something.
Cartman, you are poor and you are stupid!
She said it's fine, but that I still have to go to baseball practice tonight..
It's hopeless, dude! Butters must have made it to the hospital. By now our parents probably know we were playing with weapons! We have to get rid of the evidence! 
Hey! That's it! That dance! I can ask Rebecca to go to the dance!
He's right, dude. We have to define our style if we're ever going to make a platinum album. I mean, ah I'm a fusion guy, but Kenny's background is more Latin Jazz.
Dude, shop class sucks. Maybe we should have taken home ec.
We couldn't get trapped here forever, Cartman. We'd die after a couple of days. 
Dude, we're gonna go sneak into Cartman's and change him back into a non-ginger!
Cartman got his, then Kenny. What if tomorrow Stan says he got his and I'm left out? I might not even get to be their friend anymore.
Suddenly, Stan says he knows about some horse stables. Ih it seemed too good to be true.
I've had enough of the Bible. What has it gotten me?
You better! 'Cause if you don't find a cure for HIV, I will break your Xbox!
Cartman, don't you remember the last time you had this dream?
What the hell do you think you're doing spreading this crap to kids?!
We should not be wasting time and money making sure Cartman's fat scooter can't be tipped over!
You know God-damn well what! Now get outta here!
Well, because you got good coordination, sharp reflexes, and you're fucking fat.
We don't have time for that, dude! We just have to ditch them! Now!
Hey, where's the school bus? We're gonna be late for football practice. 
Hehe. Why the hell did you dress up like Raggedy Andy dude?
Now, don't go saying that. There's always hope. Miracles happen most every day.
To people like you, and me.
But don't expect a miracle.
Unless you help make it to be.
You hope, and I'll hurry.
You pray, and I'll plan
We'll do what's necessary, 'cause
Even a miracle needs a hand!
Oh, you are so full of crap, Cartman! Metal spikes will not come out!
They've just gone crazy for a while. Please, mister, I have to hide my brother until they come to their senses.
Jimmy, we're gonna have everyone write in a mascot that's really funny, and you have to tell us which one would be funnier.
From now on, MOOP isn't about money. MOOP is about music! We're not striking anymore! Who's with us?! 
Some high schoolers left their marijuana cigarette behind. Uh we have to throw it away before some kids find it or something.
Yeah, I hope they protest TV shows forever.
Yeah, this all happened the day after he went to that concert!
Um...  Greetings from Canada.  Well boys, it's aboot time we get to our hoose in Canada, isn't it?
It doesn't matter if I am or not. People voted and I stand behind the president.
Ih it's me, Kyle Broflovski. I had a negroplasty. Can I play in the All-State team now?
I wrote down... all the lyrics to the Happy Days theme song.
Abraham Lincoln has been dead for two hundred years!
Ah, damn it! My little brother's trying to follow me to school again.
No more. No more. Oh, come on, Cartman, no. No more. 
See Cartman, your mom is on the cover.
Is this all you brought us here to see?
Fun for children?! Fun for children?! Look at me, Dad! I don't even know what's real anymore! Weaaaah! 
You can raise $2 million, dude. We'll help you.
I, I know it's tough but-  Look at me!  I know it's tough, okay?! I know! But we have to be tough right now!
No, uh-I knew it! I knew it. I was just testing you guys. You just wait till I get to that Chinpokomon camp! I'm gonna be the toughest master of them all! So we'll see you there, a-ight? 
Yeah, Jimmy's right. I know we can come up with way better ideas than Craig.
This is amazing! But wait right here. I've gotta go tell my friends about this! 
Cartman, we can't do this alone. You have to get up.
I thought you didn't care about Wendy anymore.
I know it's hard to believe, but you have to trust me.
I didn't come to stop you. I... I think you're right, Cartman. I want to help you get the Family Guy episode pulled.
Cartman, I thought all you wanted was a Haibo doll!
Wait a minute, Dad was the UPS man?
How are we supposed to name our startup company if every name is already taken?!
Yeah. Maybe if we can get higher ratings by the end of the week, they'll let us stay on the air!
I need to get a nurection for my dad.
Dude, you'd better watch it. The principal's right over there. 
Yeah, it was the craziest thing. I hid myself on a plane to Antarctica. Oh, it was so dry down there.
Just wait till everyone sees my sweet Chewbacca costume. They're gonna be so jealous... 
Cartman, uh, all I was trying to tell you at Wall-Mart was that you-
Well, as Abraham Lincoln, I accept your surrender, and agree to your conditions. You and all the Confederates will have all the S'more Schnapps you can drink for a year.
Ah! Ow! Hey, it hurts!  Owie-ow! Help! Ow, that hurts!
...french fries...pizza...pizza...pizza-french fries... I wonder where our parents are.
Hey, you're not such a bad guy after all, Damien.
Yeah, fatass, we're gonna dig up-  Dig up Kyle's dead grandma??
NO. I can't, Wendy.  All his negativity is starting to make me depressed. I have to let him go.  And whatever happens next, I'm going to embrace with a totally  positive attitude.
Don't worry, Mr. Hankey. We'll go tell everyone. Come on, guys. 
Is that what you learned in sex ed?
I'm not going in any meat locker so you can trap me!
Hey! Look at that line!  It's way shorter.
What uh, what are you supposed to be?
Can you believe it, Stan? I never thought global warming could happen so fast. I guess... I didn't listen.
Aw, they wanna fight! They just don't know it yet! 
No it isn't, you fat turd! Because, I've learned something today. You just hate-  See, I knew it.
Because that's what real artists do. People are always gonna find a way to copy our music and swap it for free. If we're real musicians, then we should just play and be stoked that so many people are listening.
Hello. There are certain networks that we see as harmful to our families, and we want them removed, please.
Well, not really, except that Kenny keeps eating people's brains.
Yes, yes! Now the Jews shall take control of Christmas once and for all! HAHA! HAAA!!
And you! You should be ashamed of yourself! Don't you understand that us males are defined by our firemen?!
Yeah, but you're our new friend and that makes you cul.. p-piable!
I can't deal with it, Stan. I mean, all the stuff I've been reading; I really don't think I exist!
Yeah. And my powerful nunchakus make me into Bunroku , a deadly but compassionate ninja who protects those in trouble.
No, but look: I just got this sweet Cyborg Bill doll.
All the time: "Look out for your little brother, Kyle!", "Take care of your little brother, Kyle", and he wasn't even really my little brother.
Hey Ike, you wanna come watch TV with me?
No, I just can't get it to load.
Are you gonna take us somewhere or not?!
Sir? Sir, can we talk to you for just a second?
Okay. We won't tell anybody as long as you are super nice to us, every day, from now on.
Eh... hey, Cartman?  You really don't care that you can't go?
God-dammit. Come on, guys. We gotta go to Butters' house.
Yeah. And I can still get my A!
Well, Cartman, this is just my opinion, but I think the Line Ride sucked donkey balls!
Stan, I have to go home!! I need my cream!! I need my creeheam!!
Yeah, but now you can be friends with all of us!
No, dude, you're supposed to put their hand in warm water and it makes them pee.
All I wanted was to play one level of Call of Duty and you know what Ike told me? He said the living room was for old people.
Alright dude, we were going to the movies.
Okay.  N-no, ah I don't want that much responsibility. Here, you hold on to it, Kenny. 
Look, I doubt we could break a million together anyway.
'Cause old ladies are fat and you are, too!
Hey. Wuh I'm giving a speech tomorrow about people with red hair and freckles. Can I ask you a few questions?
Here, give me that.  "I am Bumbly Wumbly. I live in the pond."
Mr. Garrison, I'm the only one here. Everyone else has chicken herpes.
Yeah. We're very good friends. We're very good friends, Stan!
Well. Dude, it's uh it's good to have you back.
You're watching someone play Call Of Duty and talk about it?
It's gotta be the Komfort Inn. It's the nicest hotel in South Park. Cartman, go get your camera.
Hang on, I'm chaining my fire spells for max range.
You should care! This strike affects everybody, fatass!
But dude, check out my new Trapper Keeper.  It has five different compartments for each subject in school,  and it's all covered with pictures from Dawson's Creek.
Hey Cartman! We're almost to level 20! You giving birth in there, or what?
Don't be nervous, Cartman. This is gonna be cake.
I said, 'Larry King won't grant me three wishes.'
Oh. Ah, we're trying to reach Oculus Customer Service.
That's us!  "Dear MOOP. This letter is to inform you that Faith Plus One's debut album has just sold one million copies."
Well, you have to help him, just like I have to help my dad.
Get out of here, you piece of garbage! You wanna smoosh, go creepin' somewheres else!
Yeah, fatass! Get your fat butt on the sled!
Dude, they don't care we knocked Butters' eye out with weapons?
Well, you might have made it, but we're the ones who are taking care of it now. You have your own egg to look out for!
Get out of my way or I'll kick your ass!
Ha, Goddamnit!  Haaa. Ohhhh. Ahh, ohh, uhh, agh, 
What could it be? If only we knew what we were up against.
Oh my God, what if I'm not real?
No dude, we can't go around showing our weapons to people. Our parents'll find out we have them.
We can't wait here any longer! Dude, we've gotta get him out of here or he's gonna die.
Chop off his wee wee?! Are you sure?!
No way! You wanna go with us so you can betray us at some point and keep us from destroying the Wall-Mart.
Dude, my mom and dad keep fighting all the time. And both of them say it's because my dad doesn't have a nurection. So I want to get him one.  Damn it! What the hell is wrong with everybody? 
Nope. We wanna show the world how healthy your food is. Our fat friend here is going to lose forty pounds eating at Shitty Wok.
I know. I'm almost at the end and there's nothing. 
Kick ass, dude! Cartman's mom throws the best birthday parties ever.
Oh, shut up, Cartman. All you did was jump over one homeless guy.
Ike, there's been a mistake. You don't understand.
It isn't fair!  I don't want to be an outcast!
So where are students getting all this cough medicine??  This surveillance footage shows a group of troubled kids getting all the smack they want from a pharmacist!  Sexy Action School News reported the pharmacist to the South Park police, and he was immediately arrested! 
Do you really think that this is good for Butters? To have his face put up all over signs as the poster child for bullying?
And afterwards, he'll probably have to burn his hand and bury it.
Oh wait. Wait, I'm supposed to play here.  Hey, Mick, w-would you mind if I stepped out for a sec?
Yeahyeah, Mom. I-I can't go to the lake. No, S-stan's having emotional problems and I need to help see him through it. He's got-  wha-what is it?
Don't worry, Ike! The strike will be over soon! 
Dude, are you sure you wanna do this? Apparently this guy has a black belt in karate.
I'm going to the kitchen! This is stupid!
Will you get out of my living room, please?!  Hello?!
It was Cartman having Butters apologize for him.
I didn't see you complaining at the time, fat boy!
Okay, that's enough.  Everybody! Cartman is just pulling one of his stupid tricks on everyone, because he's trying to get out of a deal he made!
Yeah. Then it cancels out the gay polarity.
-bring me back my little brother, God damnit!
Hello, ma'am. My name is Kyle. And this is Cartman. We'd like to share our interest in David Blaine with you.
I'll give you ten bucks to eat it.
You aren't gonna cut off his wee wee. Not today, you sick-ass weirdo!
I'm not putting my finger up Cartman's butt!
When we said "documentary," I thought we meant 60 Minutes, not Honey Boo Boo!
You saw it in The Thing and you're wasting everyone's time!
I don't know what we're going to do? It's been like four hours and people still won't talk to us.
I don't know. But there's gonna be lots of food, and a band.
Huh, Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastard! 
Goddammit, Cartman! You only got that because you knew my mom would buy it for me!
Well, there you go, fatass! I hope you learned your lesson.
When a man and a woman feel ...love... they put their lips together.
Oh, like you know what pain is! Go try living in a Third-World country, you little pussy!
And if the North wins you're our slave for a month??
I need to book one trip to the moon, please. Right away.
Yeah, but you know? I think we all learned an important lesson about laughing at other people's misfortunes.
...French fries... pizza... french fries...  come on, Cartman.
Well, maybe Mr. Garrison is wrong. You should ask somebody else.
Well Stan, you want to know what I think?
Why the hell would you want three copies of the same movie?
Aw, that's just a rumor. They don't really track y- 
No, we gotta go. Sally Struthers is gonna give us a ride back to Earth.
Are we the only ones here who are completely confused?
You're okay with everything you think going up on the Internet?
Goddammit Cartman, will you stop wasting time? I wanna get this over with!
Well, what about those two college guys next door to me? They're always doing science experiments in their basement.
You mean everyone has been wanting Britney Spears to kill herself?
Gee, you seem a little stressed, Mr. Garrison. Why don't you try some Ritalin? 
No! No God damn it no! I'm telling you you're wrong! There, there's no way I can have HIV! Unless maybe...  Oh my God. That son of a bitch! 
Cartman's side is right, for the wrong reasons. But we're wrong, for the right reasons.
What did they do with all the fat? There must have been enough to last an Eskimo family months.
And you don't see any parallel between that and anything else in history?
I got a job, Stan. I am making tons of money doing some really cool stuff.
Get the hell off me! You're a freak, Butters! You can't play with us!
I think the rabbit just crapped on my jacket.
Yeah, the High Elf. He'll know what to do. 
Hey dude, ah are you the guys messing with Cartman's stuffed animals?
Mr. Garrison won't let us out of school. He thinks we're making it up.
The thing is, Ms. Claridge, we did a lot of stupid things when we were kids.
Light is a wave unless it's observed? That means all matter is just a wave.  Nothing's real! Reality in a nuh- Oh God, it's happening! 
Cartman, what is going on out there?! What happened to Stan?!
You see? Nothing, dude. Just a bunch of stars.
No, we'll stay here too. If we start wandering off, we're gonna get lost or killed. Let's just wait here and hope help comes soon.
Our main point is that the flag shouldn't offend anyone, because killing has been around since the beginning of time. All animals kill.  And the animals that don't kill are stupid ones, like cows and turtles and stuff. So people should not be so upset about killing. 
Come on, Ike, we can make it just in time for dinner. 
It's just a marketing ploy by the network. Like that time they had the first male-to-male kiss with Terrance and Phillip?
Oh yeah?! Well you're a stupid Jew! You're a Jew! Shut your God-damned Jew mouth! Good job, Jew! Jew... Shut up, Jew! You're Jewish!! Dude, he's Jewish! Jew! Jew! Jew! Jew! Jew! Jew! Jew?! "I told you Jewish people don't have rhythm." "Fuck off, Cartman!"
Because you're my little brother, Godddamnit!  And even when I'm fifty and you're forty-five, you're still gonna be my little brother!
I'm telling you, it's okay. Maybe you should ask the Lord for guidance.
How can they let an eight-year-old decide Kenny's fate?
I hate picture day at school! It's always some gay-ass photographer with some gay-ass backdrop of New England!
I don't know what to do. I just can't seem to get my friend numbers to go up. I'm desperate. That's why I came to you.
Alright, alright! Knock it off! Stop spreading lies.
It was him. It had to have been him!
Uh, I must have the wrong number. We were trying to reach City Airlines.
We did it! You see, Cartman? You won us the Terrance and Phillip dolls!
Oh Jesus Christ, I had to see it to believe it! What the hell are you doing?!
I can't. I have to wait for Rebecca to show up.
No! Because you'll just crap out your butt and then say it came out of your mouth!
I went up to Jambu's tank and I tapped three times like the trainer did. Jambu swam up and started talking to me about rocket ships! Come on! You gotta check it out! 
It always has been. See? This is nice. 
Maybe the problem is we don't have very good stories to report on.
Come on guys! We gotta go tell Chef he's in love with a succubus.
And do I have to shovel the whole driveway, or just the side the car is on?
Ssso it was all for nothing. The whole time I was... eating farts for nothing.
Damn. That guy is the coolest guy in the universe!
You couldn't get both arms behind your back, fatass!
Is that why there's crap on my doorstep every morning?
Well that does it! If us boys are going to live, we have to get rid of the girls!
That was the dumbest ride I've ever seen!
How come we never get opportunities like that?
Did you guys hear that?! A hundred thousand dollars for a picture of Britney.
Alright, look. I honestly don't know the secret, dude. Only Cartman does, and that's how it's gonna work for us.
In there? But it's very confined. I'll get cramps in my legs.
No, that... I thought that was a lot.
Cartman, do you remember how we all spent the night at Kenny's a couple of days ago?
Yep! I love basketball. I wanna play for the Denver Nuggets one day.
Jimmy, you're got to explain to the Germans that this is your fault, not ours!
Guys, guys, I know we're all concerned, but we have to work together!
Hay! He's totally underage. She's taking advantage of him.
And it actually helps the crack babies. It's like volunteering but, but we just make a little on the side.
You just feel bad for yourself that you're in detention!
Yeah. Did you make out with him, too?
Right. But he can't live with the guilt anymore. Because, even if Jesus wasn't really the Son of God, he was still a nice guy. And he didn't deserve what happened to him in Mel Gibson's movie. I I can't sleep at night. I mean, my... friend can't sleep at night.
No! Maybe we all just need a little image change, you know? Like a makeover.
Nonono, we're not going into one of those cheesy places, Cartman!
So, dude, do you have any brothers or sisters?
Terrible. Every time I close my eyes I see the house we TP'ed. I see the tears of our art teacher and hear the screams of her daughters.
Dude, come on Cartman. As employees, don't you think we should get to see what the final secret flavor enhancer is?
Would you excuse us for a second?  You just can't expect me to sit there and say nothing. No, Ike, I'm supposed to be looking out for you. So what? I wasn't going to just blurt it out, I was gonna use some tact, but you won't even let me... What? Uh uh! Stop right there, Ike!  Mom, I think maybe you should talk to Ike about love and sex!
Oh my God, they killed Kenny. You Bastard!!!
God-damnit dude, your mom and dad want you to come home!
Dude, that would have to be like, the best party ever.
Yeah. The more distance between me and the others from Jersey, the better I feel.
Excuse me, sir? I think I know who did this. We saw this guy at the last crime scene, and, and you know how serial killers sometimes return to the scene of the crime? Well, I followed this guy to his house, and when he left again, I collected some fingerprints and did a blood-sample analysis.  I'm pretty sure he's your man.
Do you really think anything's gonna be any different now?!  Do you really think that this will have the tiniest, smallest effect on the world?  It's still the same old world out there. Look.  What the hell?
Look, Stan. When Kenny died I learned how important friends are. I'm not gonna lose another friend.
Look, we could we could probably get Terrance, but he'll be performing with this other guy.
When Kickstarter went down, many saw their startup projects die, but here at Washington Redskins, we saw opportunity. People still need a way to raise money for their stupid startup projects, and with the Redskins you can now go fund yourself.  And the idea is simple. You, the people, go out and raise all your own money, and give the Washington Redskins 5%.
You're in a forest! Go take a crap!
I don't think it matters, dude. This giant snake is gonna kill everyone soon. 
They're cells that come from fetuses, and some research show that they could be used to treat diseases.
Dude, what do you mean "We don't have a coach."?
Yeah. Your fat ass isn't on the sled!
Wow. There must be at least 20 people out there. 
So, do you uh, do you have any brothers or sisters, Natalie?
I didn't see a handkerchief. Did you see a handkerchief, Kenny?
"We cordially invite you to attend the platinum album award ceremony, which will be held tomorrow morning at ten. Details and proof of sales enclosed. P.S. Nananana na na. Hahahaha ha ha."  He did it. Cartman got a platinum album.
Come on. Let's go see how Cartman is doing with his uh, urection.
I looked on the known species webpage. There's no animal called a 'Jewpacabra' mentioned anywhere.
Token actually pays attention in school! Unlike you, fatass!
Look, can you guys just get down to business so we can go find my little brother?
Because anybody who thinks 9/11 was a conspiracy is a retard!
Four tickets to The Lion King on stage!
Looks like we're gonna have to go to Arkansas. Come on, guys. We're gonna put a stop to Wall-Mart once and for all!
Since when you care about being sensitive to people's religion, Cartman?!
He did not say that! You just want him dead so you can have his stupid PSP!
Dude, what kind of sick joke is that? Girls suck ass.
Get up, Cartman! You're still not staying on long enough! 
Yeah, but you know? I think you've learned something today. You've learned that you can't rewrite history.  You see, history is forever,  and everything happens for a reason.  Sure, you can try and change the past, but usually you kno-
Dude, we don't have time for your stupid jokes! We're gonna die!
Oh. We'll wait for you over there, Steve. We have to start fighting now.
Look guys, all we need to do is split up and apply some good diversion tactics. We'll use the Texans' emotions against them.
We know. Believe me, we know. We're reminded every day that you're not Kenny because Kenny... was cool.
He is working for the Wall-Mart to stop us from succeeding!
You can't talk to Stan, Wendy. He throws up when you do.
Dude, look who I found prowling around in my back yard.
All right. Come on you guys, we have to get back home. 
He said Madonna is an old anorexic whore who wore out her welcome years ago, and that now she suddenly speaks with a British accent and she thinks she can play guitar and she should go fuck herself. 
Oh please, no reason! I got AIDS from him!
Boy, that really did the trick, Stan. I thought we were kind of, sort of, not really done for.
Our parents won't let us have weapons, dude. 
Can I just get some Goddamned tater tots?
Yes, people can get hurt. That's how terrorism works. But if you give into that, Doug, you're allowing terrorism to work. Do the right thing here.
Noo! Wait! You can't listen to him! He's a lying deceitful monster who only wants Family Guy off the air!
You've been on your fucking phone since we started!
I know. It's like we have the outdoors back again.
Agh! Look, dude, we're on level 24, about to cross into the Caverns of Madness!
Aw I don't think he wants to play, dude.
You can't sit with us, new kid. Go find another table! 
Hey, you know, that nurse is actually pretty cool.
Come on, Stan! Just strike this kid out so we can end the season! 
No, wait. No, we have to stop them! They're raping him. Rape!
Why? How could you do this? There are people starving in Alabama and... and you give Cartman a million dollars?
I'm going to put it in my room, where Cartman can't find it.
Yeah, they want everyone to stick around and watch more of this retarded show.
Dear Mr. Castro:  I am an eight-year-old American boy who lives in South Park.
Now we just gotta wait for his urection, and I can give it to my dad.
What the hell is going on?  Hello?  Excuse me, I need to get to Los Angeles.  Hello?! 
We are raising money so that Chef can hire Johnnie Cochran to sue you!
What, you been living under a rock? This is the new meme, Cat Taylor Swift Reporting.
I don't have a choice, dude. I'm gonna swallow my pride, face Cartman, and say "Congratulations. You were right" And I'm gonna give him the ten dollars. And hopefully, he won't make a big deal out of it.
See? I told you, dude. Those are dialysis machines.  Old people have to hook themselves into it with a tube, and it sucks all their body fluids out.
I won't believe it! I won't! I have to ask my mom and dad! 
Hey Texans! Let me through; we want a treaty!
And did you see her lazy eye? You can't even tell what she's looking at.
Uh, can you take my stupid glasses and put them on the night stand. Make sure they're close by, because that fish upset my stomach and I might need them if I have to go to he bathroom later on.
...No, dude, it really isn't cool. You all turned your backs on me. You're supposed to be my best friends and you just... treated me like nothing! And now you all expect me to just forget it all and, and hang out with you again like nothing happened?
Wow. That's a lot of sea men you've got there, Cartman.
Yeah Stan, we have to go find out if Cartman's pig is pregnant or not.  See ya. 
Yeah? Well Butters is ten! He doesn't exactly know what's best for him and neither do you!
Dude, what the hell? Somebody's gotta stop him.
We understand you just sounded like a freakin' racist!
That penisbutt didn't lose weight eating sub sandwiches. He lost weight because he ate less of them and exercised.
Come on guys! He's hidden them somewhere and we have to find them!
NO, why the hell would you keep eating something that made you crap blood?!
No, fatass, I came to get my brother! We all have to get out of here! It isn't safe.
Well what the hell are you doing?! This isn't gonna work now!
This is exactly what you would do if they found lice in your hair! Try to lead the charge against somebody else to take the suspicion off of yourself!
I've tried talking to him, but he doesn't want the lawsuits to stop. He's making too much money.
Eh it's "Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow." I taped it last month.
It's just sending images of cities and people and stuff.
No! You have to show Mohammad, Mr. President!
Cartman, what the hell are you doing here?! You quit!
Alright, this is gonna sting for a second. 
Come on, Cartman! How much do you wanna bet the South doesn't win?!
Get ready guys. Whoever is in here is the kid that's hacking our e-mails and phone calls! You guys ready?!
We're right here dude. Do you remember now?
Alright Cartman, I've been doin' a lot of thinking about how the company's gonna spend the money we make off the EA Sports deal. We're going to use thirty percent of the money to build an orphanage for the crack babies.
It's hard to be a Jew on Christmas
My friends won't let me join in any games
And I can't sing Christmas songs or decorate a Christmas tree
or leave water out for Rudolph 'cause there's something wrong with me
My people don't believe in Jesus Christ's divinity
I'm a Jew
A lonely Jew
On Christmas
Channukah is nice, but why is it
That Santa passes over my house every year?
And instead of eating ham I have to eat kosher latke
Instead of Silent Night I'm singing huhash dogavish
And what the fuck is up with lighting all these fucking candles, tell me please?
I'm a Jew
A lonely Jew
I'd be merry
But I'm Hebrew
On Christ-maas
And then we ran out of the Kum & Go and these guys, th-they took our friend.
I don't know what the hell to do. The whole world's gone crazy.
You know, I heard our fourth-grade teacher is some new lady from Denver.
But I always read that Native Americans were here, and that Pilgrims and other settlers kind of took their lands from them.
It's too bad Cartman can't be here to enjoy this.
Chef, we need Butters to gain about fifty pounds fast.
Mom! Dad! I have awesome news! The doctor who gave Mr. Garrison his sex change said he can make me tall and black. 
Butters! When did you call Oculus Rift Customer Service?!
So then where did the eight hundred dollars we made from selling an Internet ad to Payless Shoe Source go?
Baahir Hakeem.  Born in Chicago, eight years old, his favorite color is green... Car, Cartman, what is this all about?
Come here!  You're not actually buying this crap, are you?!
Not because of the Jews, Butters! Who told you that?
Let's do this together, dude.  Our only shot at playing any next-gen console is by teaming up. If you wanna game on a PS4, then I do too.
Look, this is all getting way too big! Tell the movie studio you aren't selling the video to them.
Towelie is cool, but he gets stoned all the time. You can't really rely on him for anything.
Oh my God! Our GameSphere! You've gotta move me closer! 
Kill it, Stanley. Kill it.  Come on Stan, kill it.
Why? Why, Mom? Because if I do something bad will happen to me? Because if I do your God might not shower me with his blessings of infected hemorrhoids?
Well, unfortunately for us, he's now on the other side! We are out of options!
...Excuse me, I have to step out for a minute. 
How much do you think Mr. Mackey needs?
Aw, come on. Ned's faking it. That frog was just a piece of plastic!
Yeah? Okay, and you checked with Kenny and Token? He's not just staying at their houses?
Wouldn't it be better to just agree with him and forget the whole thing?
She's been built up to be sacrificed, Stan!
Hey! Maybe we should ask the girls what they learned in sex ed.
The atmosphere is oxygen-based, should support our breathing.
Did Cartman just say "shitballs" to the principal?
Well what are we supposed to do with it?
Uh. My adopted brother got taken back here to Canada? So, we want to talk to the new Canadian Prime Minister about getting him back?
Look, Stam, we-we just wanted to be able to go to the movies and enjoy ourselves, you know? I'm sorry but... you're a bummer to be around. Everything is "that looks like shit" and, and "this is shitty!"
All right, cool.  Let's download some Metallica, and some Stevie Wonder. 
Whoa! What's wrong with your head?! Why are you shaking like that?
Dude, the Civil War reenactment is tomorrow! You're not gonna get it by tomorrow!
'Cause, dombass, scary monsters don't eat big fat smelly bitches!
Can someone help us? My little brother fell out of a window. 
But he's just using his time on television to rant about-
Kenny, you're clearly his best friend. Go stop him.
It isn't fair. Cartman's fatter than the goal.
...a-are starting to take offense at your actions. We feel like you're starting to become-hmm... 
Like a..big hunk of dirt with a carrot sticking out of it.
Well why don't you just tell people the truth?!
I still say this is a bad idea.
Cartman, you only come to soccer practice on Fridays, and that's only because we have Kentucky Fried Chicken afterwards!
Damnit!  Tell me what to do, Willzy-x! How do we get you home??
All right, look, th-that isn't mine. I'm just holding it for a friend.
They laughed hardest at our video. We're gonna win!  We're gonna win!
Dude, why aren't people coming to help us?
Dude, that video is making people act strange.
I told you not to call my mom a bitch, Cartman!
Set an open course for the virgin sea...
Cartman, you dumbass! You can't get a new one!
I can't believe how cold it is out here.
Stan, I don't like Wendy.  All I cared about was getting an A in this stupid project!
Where is Butters? We were supposed to leave here forty minutes ago.
Dude! Where have you been? I've been waiting all afternoon.
So is it a coincidence that Grandma DID talk to me about going to Jewleeard someday?
Hey! Don't try to pass it back on me, fatass!
Yes. Yes, I do, Dad. Now let me tell you how it works in the real world. In the real world, I can either get a Chinpokomon, or I can be the only kid without one, which singles me out, and causes the other kids to make fun of me and kick my ass.
I can't keep doing it, Wendy. I know he has an illness, but goddamn, it uh, it's like being around a black hole that just sucks the life out of everything.
Dude, we've arrived. We're super, awesome, and cool.
I am sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Keller, but I'm afraid your daughter Helen still cannot see, hear, or speak.
Uhn, you don't understand! My friend is in Imaginationland! I can hear him in my head!
Wait! Stop! Could I have your attention, please?
Officer Barbrady, I wanna declare Shenanigans on this carnival operator.
Ma'am, we are a very important talent agency. If your producers knew you were forcing people of our stature to the back of the line, well-
We got Cartman's pig so we can splice its genes with my elephant's.
I wonder how come Cartman's not in school today?
He probably just ditched to avoid that spelling test.
Ah, I don't know, it just feels like... there's got to be something else going on here.
L-look, I was just suggesting that maybe this one person could control what he said, but just didn't, for fun.
No it's not, Cartman. You know, there really are couples out there who are missing children.
Date-rape something. Yeah. Okay. I will. Okay, thanks, Mon.  I don't have to go outside!
Dad, there is so a tooth fairy, huh?
Dude, what the hell is going on?! Why did they replace Phillip?
Oh. Uh, can't right now, but maybe another time. See ya! 
Wendy, nothing's gonna happen to the egg. You can have it when the week is over and I have my grade.  Freakin' weirdos, man.
Ahhh I've seen this before. Whenever they try to distract a robot in the movies, they tell it some kind of paradox, to get its processors all tripped out.
Rebecca, there's this dance, see, the South Park Elementary Bay Of Pigs Memorial Dance, and uh, now I was wondering, ih-ih-ih if you wanna go.
What has Michael Jackson always tried to be?
This was supposed to be my story! My coming to terms with a guilty conscience! This isn't fair!
Cartman, he's got everyone on Sony's side. We can't stop him!
Get back on, fatass! You have to practice!
Dude, it's been twelve hours. Where the hell are our parents?!
Come on! Let's just get in our sleeping bags and get this night over with.
We... came to learn the facts about people with red hair, light skin and freckles.
All right, mister! You better have a good explanation for why you didn't show up to play ball!
Dude, maybe we don't have to rip a tooth out of Kenny's mouth.
Well, who really cares what that monster is outside? As long as we stay on the bus, it can't hurt us. Right? 
It's worth a shot. Come on, you guys, we can do this.
Aah I think you'd rather hear this in private!
If she wants to be with you, how about you have her tell all these people here?
What? You mean like you don't like the singing, or the lyrics, or what?
All right, I've had just about enough of this! They told us in school, and on TV, that most people in Pakistan and Afghanistan like America.
Hey McNuggets. You wanna come play for us?
Hoh!  Anyways, you put a spin on it by holding it here and-
Did you eat too many pork rinds last night? 
Cartman? Come on, dude. You have to get up.
They told us he has a m-muscular disease. An and, that ...and that he, he might die. 
Yeah, and if you couldn't prove there was a leprechaun, you have to give me ten dollars! Now just pay up and stop being stupid!
Why do you put them into people's asses? Are you planning some kind of alien takeover?
Yes, I know that! Why do you think I've been putting up with his farts?!
I know Cartman made it all up, okay?! I also know that nothing is more important for humanity than peace in the Middle East! I'm okay with this, Stan!
The only thing of yours that's larger in size is your big fat ass!
NO. Dude, maybe you should see a doctor.
How could we know she would... Aw we suck so hard.
Okay. Today's word is "spirituality." What that means to me is uh- 
'K.  She says she's been wantin' to break up for a while, and it's nothing against you.
Look, dude, things around here have changed. Sometimes, the only way to keep going is to make a left turn.
Well, we thought you went exploring and like, hunting and stuff!
Yes, Mr. Garrison, I have to go now.
I can't, Mom. We're working on our school project.
Yeah. No more getting pushed around by fourth graders! 
It's Mr. Hankey! I think he's in some kind of trouble. 
No, Butters. Look what it's done to you. It's made you even lamer than before.
That was sweet, Bebe.  Now, if you just hold the rock like this, you-
We can get people to believe us now!
Eh-heh. L-look, if you want an explanation, you you'd better go to Kenny's house.
Well wait a minute. Don't you see what happened?
Hang in there, Ike. We're gonna get you help.
How do we make three hundred thousand dollars doing that?
Okay, hang on guys. I'll use my special power to see into the future and find out where we should head next.
Man, I can't believe how much people want us to get our winning ticket back.
Hyeh. Yeah. Mung isn't even a word! We made it up! 
Wendy, I just wanna get an A, okay? Let's not make this any more confusing than it already is. &lt;&gt;
Why?! So that we can lose our business and everything can go back to old times?!
We're not kids. We're full-grown men with dwarfism! How dare you assume that all midgets are children! We demand an apology!
Whoa. Check it out, dude.  It's got little drawings on it.
It happens to be called poutine in Montreal! 
That's what bothering you? Not the fact that you're a murderer?
Move on?! Our friend was raped, Stan! He was raped, and we all stood there and did  nothing!
God? Please, if you get me out of this, I swear, I will never play with weapons ever again.
I'm sorry, can I come back in just a little bit?
That's, that that's k-kind of what I was thinking.
Yeah. And now you can take that stupid beard off! 
This is ridiculous! Are we really going to go out there and play North Park like this?!
What the hell is that lady talking about?
See? You can still make it for the end of the party.
No, it's great! It's just what this country needs right now!
We can't give him over to the gingers!
So you crapped out of your mouth! Good for you! It's still stupid and immature! 
Google him. He's this guy from Sweden who has over 30 million YouTube subscribers. We didn't even know, but he's a bigger celebrity to kids than anyone. It just seems so lame.
Listen, this is all you need to know: the economy is not a supernatural all-knowing entity. The economy is just an idea, made up by people, thousands of years ago. The economy is not real. And yet, it is real. Nowadays they'll give credit to practically anyone who applies for them.  I applied for this yesterday to prove a point. It is an American Express Platinum card.  It has no spending limit.  Do not be afraid! This is only plastic. It's just something made up by people. Truly meaningless until we put our faith in it. Faith is what makes an economy exist. Without faith, it is only plastic cards and paper money.
Fuck you! Why would they send you in to convince me of anything?!
I've even unplugged it and plugged it back in.
I'm sorry. I'm. I'm really. Cartman, I f-I feel really bad for you. Honestly.
Eh now,  come on, you guys, we can't take this decision lightly. Whoever we pick is going to be the person we do everything with from now on.
Well, we got some cigarettes, but we don't think you should be smoking. Each year, over a million people die of smo-
The Earth show can still be good. Just erase everyone's memory so we don't know we're a show.
Yeah. We've been playing with firecrackers our whole lives.
Come on, Kenny. You have to get in the circle.
Dude, this is the saddest commercial ever! Don't watch! 
Chef, do you know where "shit" comes from?
A break from what?! You haven't done anything!
That's it.  I'm going to combine my elephant with a pot-bellied pig and make…pot-bellied elephants.  They'd be smart like elephants, but small like pigs.
We need some help identifying an ancient English stone.
Here's the thing: Whether or not I'm a part of it, crack baby basketball is popular. Somebody's going to do it. So the only way for me to try and help the situation is to be involved in it, so that I can steer things in a direction that is more beneficial to the actual crack babies.  Oh, it's sooo easy for you, isn't it? I mean, what do you have to do except lay there and think about what you did at school today, or what you want to watch on TV tomorrow? Well sorry, Skippy, but the world isn't always black and white! Just because some people are born poorer than others doesn't mean I can't enjoy a few McDonald's French fries in a hot tub of gravy from Kentucky Fried Chicken!
What the hell are you so happy about, fatass?! 
You get away from me, you crazy woman! 
Yeah, what kind of name is Pip anyway?!
Can you act like you're giving him a lot?
She's not eating it, it's just coming out her backside!
Well Token was a definite winner for talent show. But then we decided to take everyone to a baseball game, to see how we got along there.
Stan...  Do you really think my hat is stupid?
You... bastards!  Wha, what the hell is wrong with you?? What kind of Prime Minister bases his decisions on hatred?  And, and takes away mounties' horses?  And French people's wine? What the hell kind of Prime Minister are you, anyway?!
I've tried, Wendy. I've called him, I've been to his house. But since his diagnosis, all he's done is gotten worse.
You guys go tell Butters to start making the cutoouts. I'm gonna go tell Mr. Hankey the good news!
Uh... W-uh... but... Come o- come on! Really? I mean, aren't there more important things going on right now?
Really sorry about all this, dude.  So what the heck are we gonna do now? Muhammad isn't safe here.
No dude. Because since you got your feelings so hurt for being ripped on, now we think you're a pussy.
God-damnit, we need to get to the new Prime Minister! NOW!
Listen, guys, I appreciate you wanting me around, but, the fact of the matter is, well, yeh, you guys are just kind of douche bags.
What do you mean, "can't"?! You made it work; just build us another one!
They knew that staying at Kenny's house would get us sick, and they made us do it anyway.
Cartman, you don't buy pubes, you grow them yourself!
There's really people out there without a Facebook friend in the world? That's so wrong.
Listen, aggotfay! An ailnay ilefay so you can eakbray out of isonpray!
Dude, you don't want your first kiss to be something you paid for. It's supposed to be special.
Oho, we will. Trust us. We won't miss this. 
You bastards. Listen, we have to give a huge speech tomorrow about corporate takeovers.
Dammit, Cartman, you are such a fat fuck!
Really? Great! I don't have to worry about that anymore. 
Gosh, I hope he doesn't cut me with his celery hand. 
Wow. I think I owe you one, Cartman.
You guys, who cares if the girls make some stupid list? Girls make dumb lists all the time.
Yeah, I think that parents only get so offended by television because the rely on it as a babysitter, and the sole educator of their kids.
All you ever do is talk about your balls!
Cartman! We've been brainwashed, don't you see? We don't have to do this!
So wait. Do we do that spin-around thing on the last beat?
Boy, that kid's having a hard time adjusting to public school.
Well, because, we don't really... believe in Jesus.
You don't think that-? But he isn't real.
This is not Mr. Hankey!  This is a fake! 
Dad, will you just listen to me for a second?
Dude, you said you wouldn't say everything looked like shit!
No, Muslims can't show an image of Mohammad.
That's it!  I don't care about the fate of the world! Screw it!
Will you stop with the underpants gnomes, Tweek?! We have to work here!  
It was him, dude. I told you, it was Mr. Hankey!
That's horrible. If that's true, I don't wanna see it.
People aren't gonna support our company if we dig in our heels and say we don't care about anything!
Goddammit, Chef isn't like that! Something funny is going on around here!
Then I can give it to my dad. 
Come on! Let's go make fun of him!
Yeah. Come on, Dad, this place sucks. I wanna go.
No, see? There's people of all colors. And they added a black guy as one of the hangers, too, so it's not racist.
You found Cartman like this and you think he's somehow trapped in virtual reality?
Sure!
I have a little dreidel; I made it out of clay.
And when it's dry and ready, with dreidel I shall- everybody!
Erm, okay, I know. How about we go to the mall?
If someone says they saw a Sasquatch, they are either lying or they are stupid. Now stop lying about a Jewpacabra before stupid people start believing you!
Why don't they leave those movies alone? We liked them the way they were!
So how was that movie last night, dude?
Nuh, it's more important than that. Our school is putting on a big show for Earth Day, and we promised people we could get you to perform.
Well, everyone in the world thinks you are. See ya. 
I don't know, I-I just thought if we all drank the Mountain Dew, the caffeine and the sugar would help us stay awake. I told Cartman he has to share it.
What does that have to do with Passover?
This is so retarded, Cartman. You've got everyone believing your stupid story.
I got it mail ordered from Africa.  The ad said it would take 4 to 6 weeks, but it only took three.
You don't know what you're talking about, fatass!
Dammit!  Ike, if you wanna keep your penis, you have to get on this train.  Ready, Ike? Kick the baby!
I'm sorry, Cartman. There's been a little change in plans!
Dude! We're not digging up my grandma; I'll get in trouble.
Give me that!  Hey! It hit her right in the mouth!
Look, Stan, you want me to just take care of this egg?
Dude, he must be loaded! What does he do?
Doctor, could we talk to her for a minute?
Knock it off! Right now! This isn't funny! At all!
Hey yeah, what about poor McNuggets? What's he gonna do now?
You said we have no idea that you're never let us hurt Wall-Mart!
All right, fine. I'll do the dumb test.
You guys, that's not cool. These people have nowhere to go.  They don't have food or shelter. We have to do something.
We need everyone's help here. What you're looking for are big boxes of ballots. Hundreds of them. Please check your basement, your attic, and-
Hey, uh, does anyone know who that guy is?!
Okay so, what exactly are we doing now?
I just didn't think it would come so soon.
Well no, not really. It's the Kindergarten teacher, Miss Stevenson.
You guys wanna see how long I can hold my breath under water?
E-excuse me, my little brother needs medical attention.
Well, how about we just say, "corporates should be stopped"?
This must be it. "Cleo Broflovski" That's my grandma. 
Because, dumbass, we can dare them to do gross stuff and make them cry! What? Were you born yesterday?
I think we should bail. If we leave the group, maybe other people will get the courage to leave, too.
Oh shut up, Cartman! Your Sweet Christmas act isn't fooling anybody!
Mom, Dad!  They're gonna kill her! They're going to in-. Wait, what are you doing here?
Heck yeah I'll visit your farm! You should check mine out too!
It's so awesome, dude. Our company already has a hundred backers. And we still have 14 days to go!
We're all here today because Chef has been such an important part of our lives. A lot of us don't agree with the choices Chef has made in the past few days.  Some of us... feel hurt... and confused that he seemed to turn his back on us.  But we can't let the events of the last week take away the memories of how much Chef made us smile.  I'm gonna remember Chef as the jolly old guy who always broke into song.  I'm gonna remember Chef... as the guy who gave us advice to live by.  So you see, we shouldn't be mad at Chef for leaving us. We should be mad at that little fruity club for scrambling his brains.
Hey! Maybe you can come with me. Then it won't suck so hard.
Did you send the videotape to America's Stupidest Home Videos?
No. I found this frozen guy in the woods today.
Mom, it was nothing. Mohammad just stood there and then drank some tea.
I'm in big trouble, you guys! We have to do something!
Goddammit Cartman, stop throwin' those stupid poppy-things at me! 
It just keeps getting worse. I see stuff from Amazon almost every day. My poor dad has no idea.
All I'm saying is that it's gonna take a lot of singing to make up for that!
How the hell do you have more friends than me?
There were no good times! And if he really feels bad he can just tell me himself!
Hey, look!  See Mr. Hankey at the Mall of Nebraska... Wow! We have to go, dude!
But we certainly want to thank you for all your hard work and attempts at being our friend, lame as they were.
We think that you might have could it by helping make "shit" an everyday word. 
Hey. We paid for the sea people too. How come they're not making statues of us? 
Cartman, what the hell are you doing?! You're suppsoed to be studying! 
We'll get back in time for a Christmas adventure.
We'd better be. We've been in line for almost an hour!
I hear your parents might give up selling meth for good.
Take a look, fatass! I beat you! You aren't going on Dateline; what have you got to say now?! 
Our lives have not been enjoyable, Trent! I promise you! 
I know, but he posted a message of me with a schlong on my head.
Yeah, but if they're wrong, no big deal. If we're wrong, we burn in hell.
Sooo, theoretically, if someone was to step in, it would beee, okayyy?
Mr. Hankey!  Where the hell did you go?
Come on, Stan. Hospitals aren't all that bad.
We need to get our friend to a hospital right away!
That quest sucks, Cartman! Think of another one!
Hey! I'm doing it to save little baby cows. I'm not gonna stop eating meat altogether.
Cartman, you go ahead and do the commercial tomorrow. But I'm warning you, those anti-smoking people are liars and they're bullies who will stop at nothing to get what they want, and that means they're dangerous. 
I-Ike, this is a big deal. You have to be absolutely, 100%-
Thanks for saving us Stan. You're my Super Best Friend.
I'm going to New York to kill the Queer Eye For the Straight Guy people!
Because without big corporations we wouldn't have things like cars and computers and canned soup.
To City Wok so we can make our money. God!
Just take me home! I don't wanna be here anymore! Take me home!
Well, it is kinda true, you know? Thanksgiving is fun and all, but the Native Americans got pretty screwed over.
We don't wanna be in a group with Tweek.
It's not Helen Hunt's ass. It's an alien space ship.
Stop wasting the tacos on your hand, Cartman!
Yeah, but you know, I learned something today. We thought we could make money on the Internet. But, while the Internet is new and exciting for creative people, it hasn't matured as a distribution mechanism to the extent that one should trade real and immediate opportunities for income for the promise of future online revenue. It will be a few years before digital distribution of media on the Internet can be monetized to the extent that necessitates content producers to forgo their fair value in more traditional media.
...And when she moved up and down, the little fetus jiggled.
Aw, come on, dude! All you've done for the last four days is mope around! You might as well hang out with those Goth kids who dress in black and talk about pain all the time!
Aagh! For Christ's sake, Cartman, when was the last time you changed your socks?
The Queen and King of Stan'ses house wish The Lord of the Rings returned to them.
No, what marches in, crawls up your leg and bites the inside of your ass?
You can't just roll into places and take people's lives away!
Yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy.
It just ran by here a second ago. 
We need to see the new Prime Minister.
Heee might not come if you're too close to the toilet bowl, Ike.  Come sit by me. 
We're already doing a paper on Tweek's underpants gnomes.
All Wall-Marts start a self-destruction sequence if you break a mirror in the back.
This tape makes people freak out wherever it goes.
How do we know which one to use?
Dude, there's a guy with a gun here!
Yeah!  I was just hanging out in my room, and then I perioded all over the place.
We're just gonna fly to California and break into George Lucas's house. What's stressful about that?
Ike, what's the matter?  Dude, you've been in here crying all morning. What's going on?  Oh. My. God. Ike, a-are you sure about this?
Nono, after we found Cartman, I put the headset on and then-
We've had just about enough, dude! You've been blowing us off for two weeks now! What's up?!
It was seriously about the greatest night of our lives.
Uh, yeah! I agree! Uh- my fragile little eight-year-old mind didn't know how to deal with what I was seeing. C-Cartman should be punished!
What?! You were waiting for me in the bathroom!
You get a platinum album for selling one million copies, you fat turd!
Miss Stevens, you have a bug on your back.
"Wanted by U.S. Border Patrol"?! "Permission to shoot on sight"?!
Oh my God, they killed Kenny! YOU BASTARDS!
Yeah! Now, which one of you is the Cartman we can't stand?!
Oh, dude, I feel so much better about being Jewish now that I see that Mel Gibson is just a big wacko douche. 
I don't get it, Kenny: why do you buy razors and shaving cream?
Okay. N-no, ah I don't want that much responsibility-bility. Here, you hold on to it, Kenny. 
All right, let's see.  Dammit Kenny, that's not what she said!
Wait a minute. Ha-how the hell did these two guys end up here?
Oh, Jesus, this bus is going fast!  Oh, I did it again!!
...But what if I do a bunch of chores around the house? Come on, you're being unfair!
You spent $10 and eight hours to unlock a stadium?
That can't be true! My parents wouldn't do that!
How the hell did they find out it was us that TP'ed that house?
Come on, dude. We've gotta get out of here. I don't know what they're planning next, but it can't be good! 
You are not going to go on national television and spew a bunch of hate speech about Jewish people! I won't let you do it, Cartman!
All right. Thanks a lot for helping us, dude.
Well, c-cause dude, I'm Jewish, a-and you know...
What the hell is everyone wearing on their heads?
Dude, it's got a hundred twenty eight gigahertz D-RAM.
No, I was taking a crap, and I heard you guys talking!
Ah, heck, Mr. Visitors, I'm just a kid all alone in this crazy world, but if you could find it in your hearts or whatever you have, to give my brother back to me, it sure would make my life brighter again.
But of course it matters, because you should be concerned there's blood in your underwear.  Do you understand this?
No, Ike! Ma, Ike keeps taking off his Squirt uniform!
Dude, because of the electoral college these votes in swing states can really matter.
Did you play the Terrance & Phillip freemium game all day?
Please, Chef, if I don't get out of school and get my little brother back from the aliens, my parents are gonna disown me.
Dude, he's not gonna swing! So just throw balls. That way he'll have to walk to first base. 
I was the one. I was too afraid to say anything, but I can't let Kenny be sock-bathed for it.
Uuuh, Chef, you haven't seen Butters around, have you?
It says right there "a parent has to be with you to sign up," and you'll never get your mom to agree to something so horrible, so ha! 
We came on our own 'cause our friend's purity ring is killing him.
Ogh. Oh cool, she likes basketball? That's perfect! Thanks, you guys!
I am no longer an XBox guy! I let my friend get grounded, but today I will give him a PlayStation!
My Dad says he can't live here anymore.
So, you guys are totally broken up then? It's... done?
Alright, fine! Let's just get this stupid report over with!
Dude, that new kid is such a douche!
Dude. What the hell is wrong with you?
Yeah, you're a great Meheecan, Butters, just not a great leader of Meheeco. 
Well, we just thought we'd let you know. See ya.
Tell everyone you made the cow look like that!
That's not being nice! That's just putting on a nice sweater!
Hi. We were wondering why fatass  I mean, Cartman, hasn't been showing up for school.
This is how they talk to us!  You'd better watch your mouth, kid!
Cartman, do you even know what's going on? We went to Imaginationland, terrorists attacked it, and now the government is about to-
It's not too late to do what's right. Give us the print. There's still some good in you, Mr. Lucas. We know there is. 
Craig, if Cartman didn't do anything, then he doesn't deserve any of the credit!
Aw Goddamnit, now you've made me miss my ride! My whole day is screwed up because of you! 
Hello. I'm Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States.
So then we sit there for like, thirty minutes, because we had to wait for this couple who was running late. 
I hate this town. I-I really really do.
I don't care if I signed an agreement!
Go on, Canadian! Beat it! I'm through getting in trouble for you!
It's this place called Des Moines. It's like, lost in time, see?  Everybody looks like you do.  Fashion is two years behind, Technology is two years behind, fads, are two years behind, just like you. 
STAN, WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE! 
I just think I'd rather... control it instead of blame it on anything.
Who the hell reads that entire thing every time it pops up?
Ugh! We're gonna end up watching this whole retared Russell Crowe show!
But that's all that matter now! It's just all ... and the new celebrity?
Alright, alright, let's get this over with so we can put her back!
I don't want to ask Mr. Hat, I'm asking you!
There! You see?! This is what happens when Cartman is allowed his right to free speech!
You guys, do you really care what a bunch of girls have to say about how you rank in looks?! 
You guys!  You gotta help me. These business casual G-men are trying to kidnap me!
Oh, I'm swell, Stan. I popped my hemorrhoid trying to climb the fence into Cartmanland, and it got infected. I really need to go to the bathroom, but if I do, it will pop again and the pain will make me pass out. How are you?
So can I go to the Magic Camp, to learn how to become a full member? All the other guys are doin' it, and it's only $69.95.
Hold on, this fight could last more than twelve hours. What if we run out of food?
Well, look at it this way: statistically speaking, we're safer inside a car with an old person driving than outside.
He won't listen to us, but he would listen to- Gordon Ramsay.
Well? Are you happy, Cartman? Butters is completely traumatized!
Butters, Butters, I'm, I'm kind of super busy right now.
That's exactly what I wanted to hear from you all along. Ah uh I still have to take Butters, but... I hope things can be cool too.
What part of being infected with a deadly disease do you find funny?!
You're not filling out nicely, you're fatter than ever!
We heard that you might be teaching Minecraft to adults.
Yeah. I think maybe everything is gonna be okay now.
I've been trying! But I just don't know how to make totally new friends on the Internet.
God-dammit! If we miss the commercials, I'll never forgive my brother!
I mean, yeyou people are all just such hick jock rednecks; it's just like you right out of a stereotyped catalog.  Ah I can't take it. See ya. 
Goddamnit. We're gonna take a short break. Be back in five. 
All right, let's just say all the bad things said about Mr. Jefferson are lies! Let's say the police department does just go around spending their time framing people for crimes they didn't commit!  Let's say it's all made up, and Mr. Jefferson is just a nice guy who's trying to be a child because he never got to have a childhood. Well that's fine, except for that he HAS children now! And when people have children, they have to grow up!
No, my little brother's been abducted by aliens.  It's true! Ask Cartman, they gave him an anal probe.
Shut up, fatass! Everyone knows I can spell better than you.
I don't care! You're not making me wait in the van again!
...You didn't save everyone, I did! You were just out harassing Muslims!
Let me ask you something, Jimmy: What happens on level 2 after you get the Ontario Nugget?!
An online chat party for all his friends... Dude, I should get over there!
Dude! He turned Kenny into a duck-billed platypus.
Bu- but I got these tickets to see Lion King on stage.
So we've gotta find another way out of here.
I mean, I do, but, well, ever since I became friends with that Kip Drordy kid, a bunch of my other friends have started ignoring me. It would be fine except for my farm is starting to shrink. I know that I should just dump Kip as a friend, but that's such a terrible thing to do and, I'm sorry I'm just so confused I... I really need a friend right now.
Well everyone has already seen it; nothing we can do about it now.
Sally Struthers, dude. She used to be on Full House.
But I thought we were supposed to care on Thanksgiving.
We don't know what you're talking about, lardbutt.
We have to watch them! We can't miss it!
...Kenny, will you tell Cartman to shut up?
I can't believe it. I can't believe we have to keep on playing.
Jesus, it's freezing out here. He, he could be dead.
Dude, have you really listened to the sixth track? I think it's my new favorite.
Oh no you don't, Cartman! Every time we get put in a study group, you sit on your ass while the rest of us do all the work!
Hold on everybody. This thing isn't even a-
Dude, I don't think this is very sturdy. 
Holy shit. Then this is all real. We've all been here from the beginning. Taking turns on the Oculus Rift headset.
Well, I just found out I'm a sex addict. I'm so scared, I haven't even told my mom yet.
Hey, what happens to me in the future?
I used a bunch of bones from the butcher shop.
Rebecca, don't you ever... look at the town? At that...  flicker of light over there?
Towelie is a tough choice because,  even though I can see how always having a towel around can come in handy, he's just always so high.
If some of us are on PS4s, but the rest of us are on XBox's, then we all can't play together online. See? This is all about committing to one machine.
You need to freeze some of your ass off.
You said "fuck you" to my face, Stan.
Do you?! Do you, Stan?! Because all my life I was raised to believe in Jehovah! To believe that we should all behave a certain way and good things will come to us. I make mistakes, but every week I try to better myself. I'm always saying, "You know, I learned something today..." and what does this so-called God give me in return? A hemorrhoid. He doesn't make sense!  What is your logic?!  Ow. 
A U-Haul. What if we bring Muhammad to South Park in the back of a U-Haul, and he just stays in there out of sight?
I endure what I must for the sake of all humanity.
Dude, if 4 million people play the brown noise at the same time-
How much do we have left, Cartman?  How much do we have left, Cartman?!
That system is totally screwed up and does nothing but wreak havoc!
Dude! Nobody wants to hear you commenting on things!
Yeah. I'm sure whatever that Super Adventure Club does is pretty tiring.
Oh, dude, I don't know how I can take it.
I can't just hide my whole life, Butters. And besides, I have this strange feeling that one of you is gonna totally betray me. 
Alright, here it goes. Cartman, you aren't really here.
Look, we're from Colorado! We, we grew up in the United States.
No. And I don't want to. Look Stan, maybe we should fo- 
Oh my God. This is like a third-world country.
They got us a truck, and an airplane, and Mr. Worf! The calves are gonna be okay!
All right, this is it! If Wall-Mart has a heart, we have to find it and destroy it! No matter what the Wall-Mart does to try to stop us, we have to be strong! Let's do it.
Well, ah I mean, we have to accept that we have a problem, and put the blame completely on ourselves. I mean, maybe this isn't really even a disease. 
Eminem, Justin Timberlake, Hootie... They all have agents. You need somebody to manage it all for you.
Oh God, here we go again! 9/11 was not a conspiracy, fatass!
You threw it away, Cartman! It's mine now.
You've never watched the news, fatass!  And what the hell does that have to do with anything?!
Oh, stop it, Cartman! You didn't learn anything! Not a God-damned thing!
Oh this is sweet. I've seen this episode.
No.  No, I want to have the Antichrist inside me!
He was a McCain supporter.  It's okay, Ike. Obama will do fine.
You son of a bitch! I won't let you win! You hear me?!
Wait, wai- I can't let this happen.  Butters.
But Chef always helps us with our problems. When we have a problem, Chef sings to us and makes it better.
Look, we already have the guy's blog. Maybe we can find an address and check it out on MapQuest.
We don't know who else to talk to.
Dude! I had the same dream! We jumped on a dragon's back and, and Butters got left behind!
Yeah, that's why we wanna have a startup company.
Yeah. And then Craig's family came on and said Tweek was the wuss, and then punched Tweek's mom in the hooters.
Right. But in the 1340s people in England stopped calling it "skite" and started calling it "shit." The same year as the Black Plague.
Yeah, dude. Your mom wanted you to have herpes on your face.
Hey, are you going to come to Ike's bris this weekend?
Uhhh, how d- how do we start this thing?
Yeah, fatass, it has to be real to be scary!
How long has it been since you've been back there.
No! I finally do understand! There is no justice! There is no God! Do you hear me?! I renounce my faith!!
Oh no, I d- I don't want to be a bother, I uh-
Yes. It's because the Pharaoh won't give the Hebrews what we want! God is angry.
Butters was supposed to go with us to Casa Bonita tonight.
Well, I guess let's just be thankful we're not Butters. They won't even let him come back to school.
No asshole! From now on you only get to have one power! So what is it?!
Here, give me some money, Cartman!  Lend me money, fat boy!
Come on, everybody. I think Kenny wants to be left alone. 
Ike, jump down, now! For the love of God, Ike, jump!
Just do it again, Cartman, and don't make it talk! 
No, we don't want to enter any of your stupid shelter!
You know what? At least Scott Malkinson has some self-respect! At least Scott Malkinson doesn't cave into peer pressure and start doing musicals!
It's that ring. Somehow, putting on that ring has turned Kenny into a boring turd.
But if I stop now, I'll just be going with the group again. So, to be an individual, I have to bomb Pearl Harbor. See ya. 
I can't take it anymore! I gotta go volunteer, dude! 
Why are you people doing this? Why would you lie like this? To children?
I'm sorry.  I I'm sorry, I can't do this.  I'm not doing this. 
Come on Starvin' Marvin, I want you to meet my little brother.
It's only three days until Christmas, you guys! You know how bad things have been around here. I think it might be because Mr. Hankey hasn't come.
I'll call the producers of the show. They'll help you find your dad.
Hi, uh- our friend has been brainwashed by some fruity little club.
Those XBox Ones are as good as ours!
That's one twenty-fourth of a second of our movie already shot! 
Just admit you were lying, Cartman, so that everyone can go home!
What?! But she looks just like everybody else. Up yours, Tina Yothers! 
Please, you guys. This is for Earth Day.  You care about Mother Earth, don't you?
You want Tammy to give you a B.J.?
He talked! I swear to Abraham he talked, and he loves rocket ships!
All right, where are the missing ballots?!  President Obama?
It just seems so unfair. People won't ever even know that the wrong man is in the White House.
A family! So THAT's why you haven't been able to spread Christmas cheer.
A-all right, let's split up and look for a passageway. E-everyone take a different direction.  Oh man, we're in big trouble here.
Ike, we could go play the game downstairs. Isn't that better than watching some guy on YouTube playing it?
Yeah. I cross-referenced his MySpace page with realtor.com. His parents moved into that green house on Janice Street.
Ech, even if it could work, how would we go about shutting it down?
Hey Stan, we're gonna go to the movies.
Look, my fat bastard friend is trying to trick the network into getting Family Guy off the air.
Ooh, who the hell cares? He's not even my responsibility.
Yeah. Stan said they're having them over for dinner tonight.
All I wanted was to play one level of Call of Duty and you know what Ike told me? He said the living room was for old people.
He said his wish is not to die. 
Beause he's a fat racist self-centered intolerant manipulating sociopath!
You're garbage! You know that?! You're cabbage!  You've got cabbage in your muff!  You've got cabbage in your fuckin' muff! 
I don't think my mom would want me doin' this.
Eh I, I don't know what else to paint.
Don't try to take me away again, Mom and Dad! I told you! I renounced the Jewish faith!
Dude! He got Brent Musberger for a leg!
Damnit! How come every time we get a sweet idea, the government has to screw it up?!
It is stupid and immature! So you got people to crap out of their mouths! What do you want, a feakin' medal?!
Dude, my mom won't even let me have a hamster.
You better watch what you say Cartman! You might be poor and hungry some day.
Mr. Garrison, didn't the guy who shot John Lennon say it was because of this book?
Okay. Just be careful you don't end up naked and jacking it in San Diego. 
Nice old Mr. Johansen runs a candy shop! He wasn't a killer and you know it!
Well, we've all talked it through and we've come up with a theory.
They did it to us again! That dirty talent agency stole our client again!
Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?! They're identical!
It's too late, fatass.  They'll be here in less than a minute.
The red- Oh come on, you can't possibly be here for that!
Cool! Maybe we can do that to Cartman's cat.
Then we should go to the record company. My dad's a lawyer, dude; he tells me about this stuff all the time.
And in the end, I know that somewhere out there... there's the good part of Chef... that's still alive in us all. 
Dude, I was having this horrible nightmare that we were at this house, and it was filled with Cartmans!
Yeah. Hey Stan, what did your dad mean when he said we're gonna play Truth or Dare?
All right, then we go with the plan. Just like "To Catch A Predator".  The first guy is here. This is probably HotForBoys219. 
Uuuh, Cartman. We know how you can get $3000.
I see... a man... with a baseball cap.  He's killing now... Oh! I'm seeing it all flash before my eyes! The guy's name is Michael Deets, and he lives at 621 Castillo Street. He's usually there between seven and eleven p.m.
They're not gonna show that stupid-ass Godzilla movie again, are they?
How dare she talk to us like that?!
This is the worst day of my life.
Yeah, but you know, I've learned something today. It would have been wrong to exploit Butters' weight loss. Because then lots of fat people would have believed it. And then gone and eaten a ton of Chinese food instead of dieting properly. They'd still be fat and, we'd be responsible for their shattered dreams.
You guys, we've just been screwed over and lied to!
Oh, we're just makin' a cradle out of an egg carton for our egg. We figure that way it'll be easier to keep safe so we can get an A.
I think I'll add some more... pigs.  Oh, maybe I should put in another field of corn there.  There we go. Nice.  Twenty nine? No, I have thirty friends.  Hey what the hell is-? Oh no! Oh shit! 
Oh! Tha-oh, yeah, the the startup company thing didn't really work out.
Hey Stan. Dude, I want you to have this. It's the twenty bucks I owed you plus thirty dollars interest.
All right I've had enough! Leprechauns are imaginary!
We thought you were meeting us at Cartman's. What are you doing here, Taylor Swifting?
There it is!  That must be of the antelope family.
Dude, where is she gonna get fetus clothes?
Don't listen to him! You still have a chance to preserve your film! 
Ungh, I can't find the word "queef" anywhere! 
We’ll get my dad to be Chef’s lawyer!
But it's gotta be perfect. We're trending well, but we need to attract more followers who want good old family values.
Now, that's what I call a sticky situation. 
Nah, my mom packed me a kosher lunch.
How exactly are we gonna use her to scare them?
Ten million?? Well that's more than the Germans want!
You guys can't tell anybody, all right? Not until I figure out what to do.
Then why the hell do they call it "veal"??
We still have an hour before the costume contest, so let's hit the house on the uh-
Not now, Cartman! I have really serious problems!
Well, I mean, all last week you were ripping on ginger kids and now you are one.
I got it! I got my Chinpokomon game controller! 
I don't want to! I don't want anybody telling me how to feel anymore!
Trent Boyett is being released from Juvenile Hall.
That's because there is no goo, Mr. Cruise. You see, I learned something today. Throughout this whole ordeal, we've all wanted to show things that we weren't allowed to show. But it wasn't because of some magic goo. It was because of the magical power of threatening people with violence. That's obviously the only true power. If there's anything we've all learned, it's that terrorizing people works.
You know, I think we all learned something today. It's fine to have your own beliefs and your own traditions, but as soon as you start excluding people from your ways, only because of their race, you become separatists. And being a separatist sucks ass.
Ungh, it said in my book that the word, "shit", started exactly the same time as something called, "The Black Death".
No I won't, because you'd eat 'em first, tubby. 
No, I mean what happened at the Pentagon?!
We'd have to put something up on the Internet that everyone would find fascinating.
Uh, hi. Our friend joined your club a while back, and now he wants to molest kids. 
Heidi Turner said you asked her to borrow superglue last week.
Anyways, I need you guys to help me so that my parents don't realize Ike is gone.  Knock it off, asshole!
Kenny, aren't you a little young for this?
Hey Token.  You-you gonna watch the game tonight, Butters? 
He didn't want us for sex, fatass! Something is making him say those things.
You see? And then I can take all my homework on my iPad, and swipe it over to my iPhone.
What should we do, dude? That big snake keeps growing; it's gonna demolish the whole state soon!
Maybe we need to make students think they have to watch our news show or they'll die.
Yeah. Let's just have a slumber party here.
You weren't playing fair, dude. Getting your dad to work part time at the mall wasn't fair.
God, that was not cool at all, dude!
Cartman, you fucking hunk of fat, rat-fucking hunk of pig-fucking ass fat.
Yes we do! We have a sweet name.  I was wrong, Cartman. "Washington Redskins" is the perfect name. I think maybe I was jealous that I didn't come up with it.
We did it guys. We finally taught Cartman a lesson. I'll bet that now, Cartman is gonna have a long hard think about how he treated gingers.
Patrick Duffy? Damn it Cartman, that's not scary!
Another devastating loss for the Cows last night, Eric. They were ahead in the game until Kelly Anderson started crying because she missed her daddy, who's on a business trip in Thailand. Uh, Kelly was so upset she couldn't play, and the Cows had to forfeit.
You didn't think of anything, Butters! Guys have been doing what you're doing for years! You're nothin' but a common pimp! 
Yeah, I hate you, but I'm not going to help kill you.
That's two against one, 'cause Stan doesn't care. So it's giant douche.
I knew it! You didn't plan 9/11 and you really didn't shoot that guy!
Yeah, they abduct people and they mutilate cows.
Wait a minute. There's only four of us.
Just take a shot or pass the ball, asshole! It's getting late!
I've been thinking, Wendy. This whole outcome is pretty strange.
All right! Now, come on! We have to practice! 
Uh. All I did was show her how to-
Are you guys having a meeting or something?
It's a really dry cold; that's the problem. It- the cold air makes me wheeze.
Chef, the police are asking questions about you!
Then why did you send us the goat?
What if the residue gets on our hands and it leads to harder drugs like those commercials say.
Well, I just figured you'd vote for my guy! Who's fuckin' friend are you?!  Puffy!
I need $17 so we can win Terrance and Phillip dolls.
Stan, you can't keep doing this to yourself. You have to go live.
Mph. Okay, Mr. Hankey. We're out. How are you doin'?
Man, I guess sometimes we let our technology and stuff grow too fast.
Well, I attend South Park Elementary, ah-and... w-one of the teachers is having sssex with a student.
That's what you care about?! Who's the poorest kid in school now?!
I dream about it every night. Every time I close my eyes I see us just running away, running while they ray-rape him over and over again.  And because we did nothing... they got away.
Dammit Cartman! I gave it to you so you would shut... up.
All right. Mr. Garrison, have you ever had a friend who got a new girlfriend, and then stopped being your friend, and it pissed you off?
He probably thinks if he apologizes to everyone, we'll think he's changed and let him back into our circle.
Yeah! Timmy's probably back in third grade right now living it up!
But everyone tries that. There has to be something you're exposed to that others aren't. Could we see where you sleep?
I bet you don't win.
They don't let big fat asses
perform on TV.
Please, you have to listen to me! The prophecy actually did come true!
Nope! We're gonna have all the pizza you can eat, twenty different cakes, and Lorde is going to play live!
But how are we gonna get the balls put on Butters' chin?
All right,  check it out, I-  Butters, BUTTERS. What the fuck?! Are you peeing in the pool?!
This is your fault, Cartman! Now we're gonna fail!
Dude. I don't know if I'm going to like the new Eric Cartman.
Well... maybe I'll take just half a hit of acid.
He's smarter than you, fat boy! I don't even know how you made it into fourth grade! I thought--
Butters has been missing for a week! You might have inadvertently gotten him killed!
I don't care! You'd better remember where your base is!
Cartman, are you still trying to become a lesbian?!
I'm gonna take Butters. He invited me to his birthday party last month, so I owe him one.
No, Mom-uh, he, he doesn't want you kissing him. 
Well, I finally got my family to use the living room for an hour each night.
I'm not better, I'm just... doing what needs to be done to make the world a better place.
Oh. Hey, that's not very nice, Mayor. Just because a person is gay doesn't mean he's a fag.
You are gonna tell everyone that you lied and that we aren't a couple!
Do any of you guys have milk money I can borrow?
Don't worry. There's gotta be another cash for gold place around here somewhere.
Hooray for the earth! We must protect it.  And now, as promised, here are TERRANCE AND PHILLIP, on video! 
Alright, alright, let's calm down! I know we're all concerned here!
Oh no! It's that  super-sad Sarah McLachlan commercial! Look away!
Hey Cartman.  I care a lot about him, too. 
We know he's dead. We mean, where is his body??
Yeah! Then she told us to throw a chair at Ned!
I'm supposed to go to the lake with my family tomorrow and swim and play in the stupid sun.
Don't be sad, Ike. Just be happy that you live in a country where people get to elect a president at all.  Hello?
Yeah, check this one out. Ready, Ike? Kick the baby!
We don't even understand how this game is played.
Thanks for seeing us, sir. My friend is really worried about his dad.
You're having dinenr with his family? What kind of family has a kid like that?
Just let it go with your fucking balls, you fucking asshole!! Your friends have been in danger and all you care about it this stupid bet! Well I've decided, Cartman, even if we had a bet, that I am never sucking your balls,  you got that?! They can throw me in jail for the rest of my life, but I am  never going to suck your balls,  never! So  there!
But that doesn't mean it has to go off the air. You should like that show. Your sense of humor is just like Family Guy.
I don't need Ike listening to you comment on anything!
Wikileaks.  It says here his name is Wikileaks.
Ah- I was just sledding, and the next thing I knew my sled rope got tangled with a bus, uh. I gut dragged for over a hundred miles before the bus finally stopped for gas.  I'm sorry about your sled, Kyle.
You've gotta try and stay on for ten seconds. Okay, Cartman?
No dude, I'm out. Go talk to her yourself. Be poetic. 
Where's all the cool costumes and jumping off ropes and stuff?!
Oh please! All you ever do is call me names and rip on me for being Jewish!
Yeah. I hope he makes his Salisbury steak with buttered noodles! 
Kenny didn't have the ticket stub. It was in his room. So we got all our candy, and you can all go home.
Yyeah well, I-I'm sorry I didn't trust you either.
What happened? Aren't you still wallowing in pain?
Sorry Ms. Cartman, but your son took some things that didn't belong to him.
So then don't have a slumber party if you're gonna be an asshole all night!
That was totally gross. She smelled like vitamins and pee.
Yeah. But you know, I've learned something today. You see, the basis of all reasoning is the mind's awareness of itself. What we think, the external objects we perceive, are all like actors that come on and off stage. But our consciousness, the stage itself, is always present to us.
Calm down, Tweek. There has to be a rational explanation.
And that applies to all of us, doesn't it? Even though it's convenient to have things done for you, sometimes it's best to deal with it yourself. 
Ask her if we get the watch right away.
Dude, we're gonna see the new Zoopeeker movie!
But, dude this doesn't make any sense. I mean, if you know it's going to make you crap blood, why wouldn't you at least just try eating less of it?
I got beat up at school... for being different.
(No! That's not what I said! Vanilla paste!)
Hm, I think he took that pretty well, I think.
These producers making a big holiday special!  They had me upload a video for a commercial they're about to air! They said my hash tag was awesome, and they wanted to promote it!
Why do you always have to hit stuff with a stick?!
This is where we all stand in a circle and pray to Moses for guidance during Jewbilee.
And we think that that is  a savage hypocrisy, because all crimes are hate crimes. If a man beats another man because that man was sleeping with his wife, is that not a hate crime?
Yeah, you're cool. And you don't say "hella."
Okay, Stan, you've been an asshole to me all week! What is up?!
Get the bull in the balls with a snowball.
I happen to be the one person who's putting everyone else's needs before their own!
Well, maybe we can sneak in over there. Come on.  Sshh. 
That if he could prove leprechauns exist, I would suck his balls.
You don't wanna go back to stinky Romania, do you? It sucks there.
Oh, jeez, we're gonna have to buy tons of these things.
You think you own the entertainment business, but you don't! Give us back Wing, RIGHT NOW! 
Singing a Christmas song isn't gonna get you nice deductions, Cartman! Don't forget: it's because of you that Santa's sleigh got shot down!
You put a guy's wiener in your mouth, that makes you gay, stupid!
You don't pee in the shower, dude, that's fucking disgusting!
Go look! It's all an ancient Incan prophecy.
Dude, thanks for helping us out by joining our team.
I'm not arguing about The Passion! He's being an asshole!
What the hell are you talking about, Cartman?!
Wait. The U.S. Government has a portal to the imagination?
Dude! I aced that test! I'm gonna win that dinner with Ms. Ellen!
Dude, if these guys are as bad as you say, then we have to do something!
Oh, hi. Is Chef here? We have to talk to him.
So, just to be completely clear, now it isn't funny, right?
Cartman, I'm going to tell you something, and I need you to believe me, even if it seems impossible.
Don't worry, you guys. He forgot about Kenny. Kenny will help us.
I couldn't get in to see the principal, Ike.
Ike!  Stop the bus! Miss Crabtree, you have to stop this bus!
Don't be stupid, Cartman! Butters doesn't have that much blood in him!
All right, what do you guys wanna ride first?
Yeah. You know, I've learned something today. Family isn't about whose blood you have, it's about who you care about.
Wait. Wait. I think I can explain this whole thing. Marklar, these marklars want to change your marklar. They don't want Marklar or any of these marklars to live here because it's bad for their marklar. They use Marklar to try and force marklars to believe they're marklar. If you let them stay here, they will build marklars and marklars. They will take all your marklars and replace them with Marklar. These marklar have no good marklar to live on Marklar, so they must come here to Marklar. Please, let these marklars stay where they can grow and prosper without any marklars, marklars, eh or marklars.
...Yeah. Or we could just show our asses.
Wait a minute, the rights to Star Wars, the movies? What the hell is going on here?!
Do you really think that beating up a handicapped kid is being nice? 
Mom, Dad, you've always taught me that being direct and honest is a basic Jewish tenet.
Hey, Cartman, do you think God's getting mad at you for not making $10 million? 
Alright, that does it, Cartman! That's my grandma! You show her some God-damned respect!
You guys! You guys! I have awesome news!
Hold on. Ah, I'm, ah... n-not right now. 
All right, you see, Clyde. Okay, we wanna help him sue whoever invented the toilet.
Oh yeah.  Fine, I'll kick your ass tomorrow, dick! 
They say they can do whatever they want because imaginary things aren't real!
Let me guess: you wrote the joke, and Cartman just laid on the couch eating Twizzlers.
Jesus Christ, you can't even walk down an aisle to get your candy? 
Hey, look. The aliens are getting ice cream.
Rainbows are those little arches of color that show up during a rainstorm.
Dude, why'd you make that deal? If we're out buying tampons, we'll miss the trailer anyway/
