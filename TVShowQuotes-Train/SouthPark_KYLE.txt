Stan, you're just jealous of that third grader and you think Wendy's gonna go for him unless you start singing and dancing too.
So you crapped out of your mouth! Good for you! It's still stupid and immature! 
Okay, Marvin. Time to take your people to their new home!
Okay, Stan, you've been an asshole to me all week! What is up?!
I can't take it anymore.  Why do people say "long story short"? They're not making it short, Stan.
Stan, do you pick giant douche or turd sandwich?
Thanks, everybody. I'm sorry I got a little crazy there.
Yeah he's an idiot but uh I'm sorry, I just... I can't do this anymore, okay? I... I can't do this anymore! 
Yeah. Well, she likes Ike a whole lot.
We're gonna make a short animated Christmas card that everyone can watch and play it on the screen at the old drive-in.
Did you send the videotape to America's Stupidest Home Videos?
That's the most horrible story I've ever heard. Why would God do such a horrible thing to a good person just to prove a point to Satan?
But I thought we were supposed to care on Thanksgiving.
What the hell are we going to do??
Throw 'em away!  Dudes, here he comes. Guys, stop coughing. 
Yeah, what if they had modified the Roman Coliseum every year? It would just be another big douchey stadium now.
Mom, Dad, can I have money to buy Chinpokomon?
Dude, what are we supposed to do? We always just play with fireworks.
I didn't come to stop you. I... I think you're right, Cartman. I want to help you get the Family Guy episode pulled.
You don't think that-? But he isn't real.
He's just... changing a lot. He walks around angry, telling me I'm stupid and, and all he talks about is sex.
I do not sound like Cartman goddamnit!  Okay, so, see ya. 
...a-are starting to take offense at your actions. We feel like you're starting to become-hmm... 
You know God damned well what's going on! This ends right now! We are a family, and you need to go somewhere else!
But that's stupid.  How can that replace Faith Hilling? It doesn't even make any sense.
I'm going to try to save Stan and Butters from getting nuked!
Well, a lot of people like Family Guy too! Who are you to decide it shouldn't be on the air?!
And in the end, I know that somewhere out there... there's the good part of Chef... that's still alive in us all. 
Yeah. They're tryin' to scare everybody 'cause they're gay wads.
Jews do NOT carry gold in a little bag around their necks.Cartman! Stop playing around!
Listen, this is all you need to know: the economy is not a supernatural all-knowing entity. The economy is just an idea, made up by people, thousands of years ago. The economy is not real. And yet, it is real. Nowadays they'll give credit to practically anyone who applies for them.  I applied for this yesterday to prove a point. It is an American Express Platinum card.  It has no spending limit.  Do not be afraid! This is only plastic. It's just something made up by people. Truly meaningless until we put our faith in it. Faith is what makes an economy exist. Without faith, it is only plastic cards and paper money.
Yummy yummy yummy can I please Cartman's farts in my tummy?
Well all right, we'll see you on Saturday, guys.
Ahh-d, excuse me, sir, did I hear you say you needed somebody for your show?
I think he wants us to get in.
It's so awesome, dude. Our company already has a hundred backers. And we still have 14 days to go!
Oh. Uh, can't right now, but maybe another time. See ya! 
Yeah. My school teacher wanted to be a woman, and you made him into one.
God dammit, Cartman! You can't keep making up new powers!
Alright, ahhh, why don't we do something else?
I was in the bathroom when you were talking to Butters, Cartman!  I know what-
Dude, did you finish your math homework? I kind of lost track of time last night.
Don't call Mr. Blaine a gaywad! He's a brilliant man.
He said the Muslims beat them here-  God damn it!
On Skippy, on Rainbow, on Patches, on Montel. 
You know, I didn't even get home until 2:30.
Just admit it, Congo! Admit that you lied about me to Irene!
Just make sweet love down by the fire.
That's not true. Kids at school like us. Don't they?
Damn, you sound pretty sick. Maybe you should go back to the hospital.
...No, dude, it really isn't cool. You all turned your backs on me. You're supposed to be my best friends and you just... treated me like nothing! And now you all expect me to just forget it all and, and hang out with you again like nothing happened?
Here's our cell phone, dude.  Will you call the police for us? 
Get him!  Whoa, Tweek! Did you hear that?
They all laugh at me!  And the girls giggle behind my back!  unable to even glance at my disfigured face.
Well you should. The poor guy shouldn't be screamed for something that just isn't that big a deal at all. 
That's, that that's k-kind of what I was thinking.
But Chef, you just ripped on Chinese people.
This is it. This one's for the game.
Do the right thing. Show Mohammad.  Do. The right. Thing.
Hey, you're not such a bad guy after all, Damien.
We believe that films are pieces of art that must be preserved from the perverse hands of their agent filmmakers..
How can I not be nervous? Trying out for the All-State team has been my dream for years.
And so, thirty percent of the money we make off the licensing agreement with EA Sports goes to the orphanage for the needy crack babies. Did you see the blueprints? The babies will have their own putt putt golf course.  Why does it matter how much I'm making, Stan? If the crack babies are getting a place to grow and develop, why does my salary matter?
But that's not fair! You lied to me!
Kenny, we have got to make Stan understand the importance of voting, because he'll definitely vote for our guy.
Erm, okay, I know. How about we go to the mall?
Principal Victoria, there's something you need to know! Cartman's Tourette's isn't real! He's faking!
Hey. Me and Cartman and Kenny are going down to Happy Burger. Do you wanna come?
We went to a bunch of rock stars and sold them candy bars to raise the money you needed.
It looks even better than their first movie, huh?
Hey, yeah! He and Ned do that stupid TV show.
Because you spent all of our money on those stupid rides, fatass! Now, either you're getting on a bull or I'm gonna break your fuckin' head open!
But we don't have years! If Chef keeps this up, he's gonna go to jail forever!
Fun for children?! Fun for children?! Look at me, Dad! I don't even know what's real anymore! Weaaaah! 
We are raising money so that Chef can hire Johnnie Cochran to sue you!
Everything turned out okay for those people. And so now you can laugh.
Noo, I'll just... be... going back to bed now.
And then we ran out of the Kum & Go and these guys, th-they took our friend.
I know Cartman made it all up, okay?! I also know that nothing is more important for humanity than peace in the Middle East! I'm okay with this, Stan!
Yeah... You know, it seems like something's still not right. 
There aren't gonna be new shows! Don't you get it?! Terrance and Phillip are Canadian! We have to get Canada to end this strike!
I can seriously hold my breath longer than anybody. Somebody time me, all right?
Come, on, Kenny! I'll give you five bucks to do it!
How... How did this happen?  Mom, Dad? Why are you shopping here?
You know why! Because we're trying to keep our parents from watching murder porn!
No, Cartman, we're going in there and splicing Fluffy and my elephant together.
Those XBox Ones are as good as ours!
"What I Wanna Be When I Grow Up"?
Dude, what the hell? Somebody's gotta stop him.
I think he said he wants to practice on a real bull.
If you want your share of the money, then you're gonna shovel snow like the rest of us!
Hang on, I'm chaining my fire spells for max range.
But it's our game. We bought it together.
"No, no, please! This time I swear I won't make albums or movies."
Where is Cartman? He said he was gonna bring money for us to buy a pumpkin.
Shh, Blanket, we're gonna take you away for a little while, okay? 
It says right there "a parent has to be with you to sign up," and you'll never get your mom to agree to something so horrible, so ha! 
They're evil! I WISH I DIDN'T HAVE ANY PARENTS!
You sonofabitch, Cartman!  You don't fart when you're locked in a small space with other people! 
Well, we'd better get working. Cartman, you go home and call all the pet stores in the phone book.
I thought you didn't care about Wendy anymore.
We totally think you should have more money.
Let me out of here, kid! Why are you doing this?
The kindergarten teacher is having sex with my little brother.
From now on, MOOP isn't about money. MOOP is about music! We're not striking anymore! Who's with us?! 
Mr. Jackson, please, you're causing a lot of problems.
Hey guys. You wanna throw the football around?
Do you know what those kids are going to do to you?! A little middle-class white boy telling them what to do? They are going to fucking murder you! 
Whoa, hang on! We shouldn't be learning how not to get caught. We have to take responsibility for our actions. 
I know, I know. Well, look: I'll stay over anyway so I can play for... eighteen hours, and then I'll go to the lake. 
Is that what this is all about?!  You came up with this whole idea so you could get a stupid toy?! 
Yeah, but maybe we need a name that's more affirming, like, shows what we stand for.
Who's everyone?! Who all is in on this?!
It's not cool! Ike isn't old enough to understand.
"You know he can't think on his own, Kyle!" "Brush and floss, Kyle!" "Where has that finger been, Kyle?"
No.  No, I want to have the Antichrist inside me!
Yummy yummy yummy I want Cartman's farts in my tummy.
We said we wouldn't be a part of this fad and look at you!
Yeah, fatass, it has to be real to be scary!
We have reached the Great Pass of Mount Ururalak.
Oh yeah. Tom Cruise does have Seaman on his back.
Dude, this guy's trying to rook us! We can go someplace else!
God-damnit! Now, what the hell are we gonna do?!
All right, mister! You better have a good explanation for why you didn't show up to play ball!
I was... I was just going to get a drink of water.
Uh oh. I guess we shouldn't have made him eat it. 
She's been built up to be sacrificed, Stan!
So if you're identical, does that mean you all think alike?
You know something? I think that's good. It was wrong to make Timmy a singer.
Look, guys, we all have to agree on one system.
"So this is how America works. We have gods and clods. My dad says America needs both rich and poor to survive, but I have a better idea."
Excuse me, sir? I think I know who did this. We saw this guy at the last crime scene, and, and you know how serial killers sometimes return to the scene of the crime? Well, I followed this guy to his house, and when he left again, I collected some fingerprints and did a blood-sample analysis.  I'm pretty sure he's your man.
Yeah, I don't even know if I'm gonna watch it anymore.
Yes we do! Just not the Christian heaven!
All right, Kenny, let's go!  Kenny?  Kenny!  Don't worry, Kenny. You didn't die for nothing.  We're gonna get Wing back as our client and... and make a ton of money! I swear it to you!
Okay, it's third down. And now, somebody make a play!
Yeah, look what you're doing to this poor kid.
Twenty... million?  Are you nuts? We don't have that kind of money.
I don't know what to do.  Part of me feels like I wanna end it all now.  Tell people what heppened. You know, I never knew how beautiful this pond was before.  So cold. The world can feel like that.  So calm on the outside, as if nothing bad ever happens.  Ow.  What the hell are you doing, Cartman?!
You put a guy's wiener in your mouth, that makes you gay, stupid!
Dude! Did you really lose all that weight eating nothing but sub sandwiches?
Excuse me.  Do you know which way the network president's office is?
You're doing the right thing, Stan. Don't you feel like you're a part of something now?
The water tank?   Hey I'm not going with you!
And that's why I feel like you guys are more than just friends. You're my family.  Except for Cartman.
You're a fat skank, Mom, and your tits belong in a morgue. 
Pot's illegal too, but people still manage to find it. Ever since that first time Kenny cheesed, he hasn't been the same. You've all noticed the change in him. I'll bet Kenny's at home cheesing right now.
I knew it! Don't let that fat turd walk all over you, Jimmy! Stand up for yourself!
Yes, yes, hello? Is this Mr. Su-gi-yama with the Japanese space program?  How much to take a whale into space?  Nu-no, we don't want you to eat the whale, we want you to send it to the moon. How much? Jesus Christ! Uh hang on.  Hello? Jimmy, any luck at the Chinese Embassy?
Dude, you said you wouldn't say everything looked like shit!
He purposely infected me with his HIV virus!
This was supposed to be my story! My coming to terms with a guilty conscience! This isn't fair!
You know what? I'll bet it was you!
Maybe the problem is we don't have very good stories to report on.
Ih it sure is quiet up here in the mountains and it's dry, too. Do you have a humidi-humidifier?
But our big game with Lakewood is Saturday!
Hey, Stan. Do you know how to play Truth or Dare?
...I can't even get her to understand. It's like she's from another planet.
It's what we do in Jew Scouts. Usually we just sit around and make stuff. But tonight, because there's a meteor shower, we're gonna do some big thing out in the woods. It's gonna suck ass, I'm sure.
Dude, it just can't be better than ours. It just can't be.
...But you can't melt ice with a cool song, 'tardheart.
Phew. The one videotape is sought after indeed.
Where's all the cool costumes and jumping off ropes and stuff?!
Well, I guess it's mostly the way Mr. Garrison stuck a gerbil up Mr. Slave's ass.
Cartman! I will not stand by and let you cheat your way to winning the Special Olympics!
Dude, why the hell would you DO that?!
It's too late, fatass.  They'll be here in less than a minute.
So then, she's gonna be seeing other people? Is she, sort of, available?
Nuh, it's more important than that. Our school is putting on a big show for Earth Day, and we promised people we could get you to perform.
Guys, we need to talk to you. I really don't think we wanna be a company that ISIS looks up to. We should maybe issue a statement saying that we don't sanction them.
Why? Why do I have to accept it when I can change it?
Dude, I don't think 8-year olds are supposed to take hormones.
Ha! Our bet was that you would get a platinum album, not a myrrh album! I don't owe you anything, fat boy!
God damn it!  Wendy, Stan wants to know why you break up. 
They told us he has a m-muscular disease. An and, that ...and that he, he might die. 
Ungh, it said in my book that the word, "shit", started exactly the same time as something called, "The Black Death".
I can't believe it. I can't believe we have to keep on playing.
Dude! I've never seen Cartman care so much about something.
Come on! Let's go make fun of him!
That's how God is! And if Pharaoh doesn't give us what we want, next he's gonna kill all Egyptian first born boys!
Oh, I'm swell, Stan. I popped my hemorrhoid trying to climb the fence into Cartmanland, and it got infected. I really need to go to the bathroom, but if I do, it will pop again and the pain will make me pass out. How are you?
Oh my God, what if I'm not real?
Cartman, do you even know what's going on? We went to Imaginationland, terrorists attacked it, and now the government is about to-
Stop saying "hella," Cartman!  How are we gonna win the contest with a squash?  Whoa, Stan. You don't look so good.
I'm not better, I'm just... doing what needs to be done to make the world a better place.
Yeah? Well... maybe you can forget what happened, but I... can't.
Hey, uh- we were all just talkin' about how when you get better, we're all gonna go down to Stark's Pond again and go camping. Huh, Stan?
She's not eating it, it's just coming out her backside!
Here.  We made ten million theoretical dollars. It's all for you. 
Well, do you also do other surgeries like that?
Yeah, but, why can't XBox automatically let you pre-order Metal Gear Solid V?
Hybrid cars don't cause smugness, people do.  Look, hybrid cars are important. They may even save our planet one day. What you all need to do is just learn to drive hybrids and not be smug about it.
Well then,  you've got to call the jail right now and tell them that you forgive Cartman for being a dumbass!
Dude, you can't do this! How can we be the Avengers without Captain America?
Look, that was a long time ago. Maybe Trent Boyett has forgotten all about it.
What are we supposed to do with him?
Kenny's not really my friend, Ma. I don't give a rat's ass about him.
Well, we thought you went exploring and like, hunting and stuff!
This is Cartman. I have to take it.  Hello?
You too! Right now! #webelieveinyou! We've got to make him appear! 
I can't watch the meteor shower with you, Kenny. I have to go to Jewbilee.
Sir, just think about what you're doing to free speech!
What if the residue gets on our hands and it leads to harder drugs like those commercials say.
Oh, yeah. Yeh-yeah. It's a-it's not even noticeable. 
Do you?! Do you, Stan?! Because all my life I was raised to believe in Jehovah! To believe that we should all behave a certain way and good things will come to us. I make mistakes, but every week I try to better myself. I'm always saying, "You know, I learned something today..." and what does this so-called God give me in return? A hemorrhoid. He doesn't make sense!  What is your logic?!  Ow. 
Stan...  Do you really think my hat is stupid?
What is going on?! Why do you want Britney Spears to die?!
Not your dad, Cartman! What's your dad got to do with this?!
Just stop it!  Stoop iiit!!  There's a logical explanation for that.
It's this place called Des Moines. It's like, lost in time, see?  Everybody looks like you do.  Fashion is two years behind, Technology is two years behind, fads, are two years behind, just like you. 
Uh…yeah…we want to crossbreed an elephant with a pig.
Don't you guys think this is a little suspicious? We should buy something else so it doesn't look obvious.
Aw, that's just a rumor. They don't really track y- 
But right now I'd say if we're gonna have a retard for a friend, I, I have to pick Timmy. Because Timmy doesn't tell any jokes.
Is it cold in here? I realize we're in the mountains, but do we have to freeze to death?
Please, Chef, if I don't get out of school and get my little brother back from the aliens, my parents are gonna disown me.
The new neighbors that moved in next to Stan's house. Me and Ike saw the mom get a parking ticket, and she called the parking cop "muff cabbage".
No! What we really should do is go to our parents right now and take responsibility for smoking ourselves. Even if it means getting grounded.
I went up to Jambu's tank and I tapped three times like the trainer did. Jambu swam up and started talking to me about rocket ships! Come on! You gotta check it out! 
I can't. I have to wait for Rebecca to show up.
Aw man, at least the real Jesus didn't weigh 400 pounds!
Dude, you're just jealous because I'm Chinpoko Master!
Wendy, I just wanna get an A, okay? Let's not make this any more confusing than it already is. &lt;&gt;
Ladies and gentlemen, we have an epidemic in our country. Obesity is costing taxpayers millions, and some are taking advantage of a system that is flawed. Over the past several days I have filmed such a case, and the shocking video has been edited by my partner, Token. It is our hope that this film will cast light on a serious issue. 
Wait a minute, that thing landed on Kenny, and they took him to the mortuary.
If it needs to be seen by everybody, then why don't you put it out on the Internet for free?!  Well?!
Dude, where in the world can Britney Spears go where nobody will bother her?
Dammit!  Ike, if you wanna keep your penis, you have to get on this train.  Ready, Ike? Kick the baby!
What?!! Sick, dude, I'm not kissing a girl!
That does it! I know what I have to do! 
Heee might not come if you're too close to the toilet bowl, Ike.  Come sit by me. 
I think I'll add some more... pigs.  Oh, maybe I should put in another field of corn there.  There we go. Nice.  Twenty nine? No, I have thirty friends.  Hey what the hell is-? Oh no! Oh shit! 
Cartman released the PS4s Cartman. They're being reviewed. People are liking them.
It's not me! I'm here to help you, fatass!
Alright, fine!  You're the spokesman, Cartman! But you'd better not screw it up!
I think we can piece this case together now.
Dude, where are we going to find a pumpkin to carve?
When the bar gets lowered, Token, we all pay the price. What if Honey Boo Boo was a little black girl? Being fattened up by her mom and talking about grits and hominy?
No dude. Because since you got your feelings so hurt for being ripped on, now we think you're a pussy.
That's nice, kid. I knew Mr. Hankey before he was even famous.
Well then we're gonna end up freezing his hellish heart with a cool island song.
Heck yeah I'll visit your farm! You should check mine out too!
I don't think Ike wants to go to Squirts.
Hey, we should start our own Cirque du Cheville.
Alright guys, listen up! This may sound a little strange, but, the whale, at the Denver Sea Park, is going to die, unless we get it to the moon,
That bull sucks! He's not even bucking or anything!
No no, he's right! We've gotta make it for someone in need so that people have to go.
We got the money, Mr. Hankey. We're gonna make our animated Christmas card.
I said go away!  My father said you aren't real.
Did you hear that, dude? We still get $3000. That's enough for you to do your DNA test.
She said it's fine, but that I still have to go to baseball practice tonight..
Well good for them. They shouldn't! The writers are standing up and saying they aren't going to be intimidated!
He just... He just... stopped breathing. And it was over.
Well, we just thought we'd let you know. See ya.
Oh no way! Look!  The pan flute band's put in prison, just like what happened. 
We've gotta move away. We've gotta get as far away from this town as possible!
Nothing. But the guys said if I don't confess my sins and eat crackers, I'm gonna go to hell.
Wha-? Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You Bastards!
I'm not putting my finger up Cartman's butt!
All right, but it's gonna take more than one good player to beat the champions, Stan. You'd better have a really good game plan.
Vi, Visitors, this morning you took my little brother, Ike. He's the little freckled kid that looks like a football. At first, I was happy you took him away. But I've learned something today. That having a little brother... is a pretty special thing.
No, my little brother's been abducted by aliens.  It's true! Ask Cartman, they gave him an anal probe.
Go ahead! People will just download your songs for free on the Internet anyways!
A break from what?! You haven't done anything!
I didn't come here to talk about The Passion, Cartman!
But what about Mr. Garrison? He can't go back.
Yeah, they're almost as big as his mom's. 
(No! That's not what I said! Vanilla paste!)
No! You have to show Mohammad, Mr. President!
Dude, it's been twelve hours. Where the hell are our parents?!
Don't worry, dude. That little truck just runs on D batteries. It's gonna run out of juice soon. 
Jesus Christ, you can't even walk down an aisle to get your candy? 
Do you mind telling us what the hell is going on??
We can get everyone back into the Christmas spirit by making our very own animated Christmas special, and showing it to everybody in town! 
What could it be? If only we knew what we were up against.
No, I'm being totally serious. That is the best idea you've ever had. You should run away to Mogadishu. You should go there right away. I'll even help pay for your ticket.
Well it-... it's okay. there's no denying it all worked out for the best this time a-.
Dude! I had the same dream! We jumped on a dragon's back and, and Butters got left behind!
You'll never get a platinum album doing Christian rock, Cartman! It was a stupid idea then, and it's a stupid idea now!
Yeah, I like him a lot more than Cartman.
He's going to kindergarten because he's a genius!
Yeah. You used to sit in the living room with family and friends to hear their commentary on things. Now you can get it with a little guy in a window on the screen. Someone who just comments on stuff. I mean, really? Who would even WANT to do that?! 
Let's all try to help a little, 'cause 
No, no, you... you wrote down Turd Sandwich.
I can't take it anymore! I gotta go volunteer, dude! 
Yyeah, except maybe it's not perfectly great, because to some degree, Ike and Ms. Stevenson are having an-.
Light is a wave unless it's observed? That means all matter is just a wave.  Nothing's real! Reality in a nuh- Oh God, it's happening! 
Alright, Cartman. I'm gonna give you... a jail-time card.  You lose a turn.
Yeah! What the hell were we thinking?! Boooooo!
Wow! I guess Cartman really did take care of them.
Our main point is that the flag shouldn't offend anyone, because killing has been around since the beginning of time. All animals kill.  And the animals that don't kill are stupid ones, like cows and turtles and stuff. So people should not be so upset about killing. 
I used a bunch of bones from the butcher shop.
Well why not? You want us to get AIDS?
You yourself led the campaign against the colorization of films. You understand why films shouldn't be changed.
NO. Dude, maybe you should see a doctor.
Well, looks like everything turned out alright for them.
Look everybody, I know we all feel our hands are tied, but the fact is, we can do something about this. There's an app which can actually allow kids to block things that their parents watch on television. And it is password-protected with a security code that only a child would know.
Sister, you don't know the half of it.
Oh dude, check it out. I got a Jake Plummer.
Lots of people will when I tell them!
You don't get it, Stan! I can play here all I want. I even get free Frescas. I don't need you anymore! 
You're saging these games do this on purpose?!
Don't worry, Ike! The strike will be over soon! 
So how was that movie last night, dude?
All right dude, what the hell has gotten into you?! I don't trust for one second that your sudden concern for the Muslim people is real!
Come on! Let's just get in our sleeping bags and get this night over with.
Wait! You know what we should do? We should all take a bunch of cough medicine!
I said, 'Larry King won't grant me three wishes.'
Look, the truth is, we all have a bigger problem now, and you know it. Nobody is going to get anything if we don't work together against those thousands of other shoppers.
It's not a presentation, it's a hate speech! People aren't creeped out by gingers!
They knew that staying at Kenny's house would get us sick, and they made us do it anyway.
God-dammit! If we miss the commercials, I'll never forgive my brother!
It's only three days until Christmas, you guys! You know how bad things have been around here. I think it might be because Mr. Hankey hasn't come.
No. I found this frozen guy in the woods today.
And if the North wins you're our slave for a month??
Yeah, you're a great Meheecan, Butters, just not a great leader of Meheeco. 
Nobody's blood is going to jump up in the air!
Come on, Cartman! You haven't liked anybody else!
I didn't see you complaining at the time, fat boy!
Well, I'm sure glad this is all over with. Let's go count our candy.
Platform 4F. Uhhh, it must be on the other side of the station.
Ah, damn it! My little brother's trying to follow me to school again.
Dude, that video is making people act strange.
Okay. But you've gotta promise to not complain.
My name is Kyle Broflovski. My friend was raped last Memorial Day weekend. And, and I  I'm gonna help prosecute the men responsible.
Do you know how to start a fire?
Aagh! For Christ's sake, Cartman, when was the last time you changed your socks?
Wow. There must be at least 20 people out there. 
Why don't they leave those movies alone? We liked them the way they were!
Yeah. I hope he makes his Salisbury steak with buttered noodles! 
I hate this town. I-I really really do.
'Cause old ladies are fat and you are, too!
That fat turd up there is the one who set up you and Token 'cause he thinks blacks belong together! 
I didn't see a handkerchief. Did you see a handkerchief, Kenny?
So... why would one come to America to warn us about a terrorist attack.
Yeah. I guess we gotta try to get into that club, too.
Fine!  Then YOU do it, you're so tough!
Yeah, but now we think maybe heaven isn't a place you can get to, maybe heaven is just an idea. A frame of mind or, or something gay like that. Maybe heaven... is this moment, right now.
But, dude this doesn't make any sense. I mean, if you know it's going to make you crap blood, why wouldn't you at least just try eating less of it?
Look, maybe he's forgiven us. I mean, we were only in preschool
Oh well, at least as president you can run the school the way you want.
But we can put our money together with the money you made whoring yourself to all the women. How much did you make?
Yeah. Look what he did to our friend, Kenny.
You're right, Stan. My Grandma isn't floating around, judging me and watching what I do. She's dead. Dead and gone forever.
Well, because you got good coordination, sharp reflexes, and you're fucking fat.
Well, I was just digging around, and I was all like, 'dude, I found this triangle' and my friends were like, 'dude' and I was all like 'dude.'
Ike, you need to have a life. Have fun. Then ruin it by having a serious relationship. 
But it's like eight pages long and they send me a new one like every three weeks! How can they know if I-
Geez, all that from a stupid video show.
All right, I really don't want to have to do this, but... I'm not happy with the direction this company is taking.
Copy, Fox trot, let's fly in the goods Tango.
We'd have to put something up on the Internet that everyone would find fascinating.
But it's gotta be perfect. We're trending well, but we need to attract more followers who want good old family values.
This is wrong. Uh this just doesn't make any sense. Why would Homeland Security send us into Peru?
Thanks for seeing us, sir. My friend is really worried about his dad.
But, but he's lying! He doesn't have a conscience!
Oh, stop it, Cartman! You didn't learn anything! Not a God-damned thing!
IT WASN'T MY IDEA, IT WAS YOURS! YOU KILLED KENNY, YOU BASTARD!
How can you be willing to kill people for a holiday special? What's wrong with you?
Well, unfortunately for us, he's now on the other side! We are out of options!
Even the dumbest lie can have big consequences.
Hey yeah, what about poor McNuggets? What's he gonna do now?
What if this is all just somebody's dream?
Yes it is a big deal! Why do you think everyone washes their hands after they go to the bathroom?!
No, I don't have sand in my vagina! I just think it's a little immature for us to be standing around talking about one dumb word being on TV!
Would you stop scaring everyone with your dumb ass myth!
Boy, that kid's having a hard time adjusting to public school.
Thank you, rabbi.  In 1973, the United States officially issued an apology to the African American community for slavery. In 1956, Germany officially apologized for World War II AND the Holocaust. And now, I believe, in 2004, the Jewish community needs to apologize for the death of Jesus.
Yeah, but you know, I've learned something today. It would have been wrong to exploit Butters' weight loss. Because then lots of fat people would have believed it. And then gone and eaten a ton of Chinese food instead of dieting properly. They'd still be fat and, we'd be responsible for their shattered dreams.
Okay. So we put little "woo" mouths on all our heads.  And then we shoot that for one frame.
...Remember when life used to be simple and cool?
You probably should come clean and tell the truth. Did you superglue your bracelet?
Nuh uh! It's "Whoever denied it, supplied it!"
You guys go tell Butters to start making the cutoouts. I'm gonna go tell Mr. Hankey the good news!
No! It's alright! Just give me some time to work on them. I'll see you guys later. 
Noo! Wait! You can't listen to him! He's a lying deceitful monster who only wants Family Guy off the air!
Well, you're not gonna last down here either, Mr. Hankey. Now, come on! I'm not gonna let you die!
Can you guys meet me over at Cartman's house tonight at around midnight?
It doesn't matter. He'll be most excited to meet me!
All the time: "Look out for your little brother, Kyle!", "Take care of your little brother, Kyle", and he wasn't even really my little brother.
We have to speed this up!  Uh, can we collect our Internet money in front of you, please?
Mom? Can Kenny go to Jewbilee with me?
Dude, we're totally lost! We're gonna die out here!
Please, sir. I traveled a long way to get here. He's the only person who can help me.
Come on, limey, don't be a wuss! Are you just gonna be a little French pig your whole life?
Oh come on! It's obvious what happens! I get killed by Santa Claus so that Christmas is saved!
That's 15 people we got to agree to come see David Blaine perform in Denver.
We can't. Kenny just checked. There's a wall of people like seven miles thick behind us.
But why not? You said sometimes people need surgery to make them feel better about themselves.
Nonono, we're not going into one of those cheesy places, Cartman!
THIS is the reason why our living rooms are dying!
Okay. We've got $15 between us. That means we get nine balls to throw.
That's what bothering you? Not the fact that you're a murderer?
Dude, he must be loaded! What does he do?
What if we do a show where we-  Uh, no.
If you do not accept treatment I will no longer give you money or be your friend. I will not help you kill yourself.
It's my little brother. He's really changing and I feel like-
Wow. Did he say that in the Bible?
Don't worry. There's gotta be another cash for gold place around here somewhere.
Stan, the PS4 doesn't have the seamless transition between games, movies, and TV offered by XBox One.
Let me ask you something, Jimmy: What happens on level 2 after you get the Ontario Nugget?!
I don't know about this guys. I think playing hide and seek in the airport might be dangerous.
Wha?! Well wait, ahah I wanna see what happens here!
Dude, they've been doing that for a long time.
Cartman, I'm going to tell you something, and I need you to believe me, even if it seems impossible.
Well, Cartman, this is just my opinion, but I think the Line Ride sucked donkey balls!
L-look, I was just suggesting that maybe this one person could control what he said, but just didn't, for fun.
It is not stupid, Kenny! This is my faith and you shouldn't make fun of it!
Who the hell reads that entire thing every time it pops up?
But I can't wait to be an adult to be happy. That's forever from now.
Alright, alright, let's calm down! I know we're all concerned here!
Rebecca, don't you ever... look at the town? At that...  flicker of light over there?
I know. I'm almost at the end and there's nothing. 
Oh God, what have I done?!  I'm sorry. Please, I don't wanna be the vessel for the Antichrist.
Okay, fine, I will!  H-wait a minute! I don't even want one copy of Time Cop! 
No, what marches in, crawls up your leg and bites the inside of your ass?
Ex-cuse me?! If my little brother has been getting some athlete's hormones, then who has been getting Ike's medication?!
There's really people out there without a Facebook friend in the world? That's so wrong.
Oh, brother, here we go again. Cartman, there is not a sound frequency that makes people crap their pants!
Hey! Let's pour them in the teacher's coffee tomorrow morning.
Well, this is what I believe in now, Stan. And if you can't respect that,... then I guess we're not best friends anymore. 
That's it.  That's how our parents broke the passcode. I never thought anyone would stoop so low!
Aw, dude! You can still kinda see the spleen!  How much, Kenny?
...Okay Cartman, what do you want this time?
Yes. Yes, I do, Dad. Now let me tell you how it works in the real world. In the real world, I can either get a Chinpokomon, or I can be the only kid without one, which singles me out, and causes the other kids to make fun of me and kick my ass.
Oh my God, you're right! You're totally right!! EVERYONE! GET A NEW TREND GOING! FAST! #webelieveinyou!
But you need to understand: we have a whale here that needs to get back to his family on the moon.
Looks like we're gonna have to go to Arkansas. Come on, guys. We're gonna put a stop to Wall-Mart once and for all!
Yeah, try to have everyone make peace so it doesn't seem like a big deal.
With his power, I can finally make the earth a better place for the Jews!
This is not Mr. Hankey!  This is a fake! 
Yeah. And we're sorry for turning Ned into a vegetable.
But I always read that Native Americans were here, and that Pilgrims and other settlers kind of took their lands from them.
Sure. Remember that time that that kid in the red shirt decided to go off on his own?
And you! You should be ashamed of yourself! Don't you understand that us males are defined by our firemen?!
Mr. Hankey? Mr. Hankey, is that you? Hello?
We're not bailing on the party, we're just think there's... more important things right now!
Hey yeah! That'd be sweet! We could totally ruin their lives! 
Cartman, what the hell are you doing?! You're suppsoed to be studying! 
That's what they're talking about on the news!
Well no, not really. It's the Kindergarten teacher, Miss Stevenson.
Cartman, you're supposed to be studying! What the hell is all this?!
No, I mean what happened at the Pentagon?!
You're in a forest! Go take a crap!
...And when she moved up and down, the little fetus jiggled.
Wait. I thought you called your planet Marklar.
It was my idea and we're gonna tell everyone to write in "Giant Douche!" It's way funnier!
And Stan for being in love with Wendy.
It wasn't like Faith Hilling was that great. I mean-
Oh cool. We get to watch a movie?
Look, it may not seem important now, but your vote really does count, and we all have to do our part.
It means Jehovah is going to use his powers to keep the Pharaoh from letting us go.
No, I mean, this is impossible, Stan! Cartman is the biggest asshole in the world! How is it that God gives him a million dollars?
Just let it go, dude. You only had sixteen dollars and twelve cents. Count all your losses and move on. He's smarter than you.
Ih it's me, Kyle Broflovski. I had a negroplasty. Can I play in the All-State team now?
Why do they even allow those things in stored?
Oh, shut up, Cartman. All you did was jump over one homeless guy.
Goddamnit, you see what happens when you spread this stupid crap, fatass?
Wait... stop it, stop it!  I can't let Kenny be sock-dried.
That's not true, fatass! I have red hair, and I don't have to avoid the sun!
Yeah. We're gonna call you Fartboy from now on.
Dad! Somebody's at the front door!  Well am I grounded or not?!  Ugh. Fine! I'll get it! 
Oh! Tha-oh, yeah, the the startup company thing didn't really work out.
Well what are we supposed to do with it?
Butters, you don't really believe that, do you?
Hey guys. Guys! Hold up.  Hey uhm, you're kind of friends with that Nichole girl, right?
I did it! Now I can go to the Raging Pussies!
No it's not, Cartman. You know, there really are couples out there who are missing children.
Well how come Kenny's family eats frozen waffles for dinner and has rats on the floor, and we have a big house and lots of food?
Ma'am, please, I think my little brother needs immediate help.
Really sorry about all this, dude.  So what the heck are we gonna do now? Muhammad isn't safe here.
I guess so. She's, like, his first real girlfriend ever.
But I'm gonna be Royal Crown Chinpokomon Master!
Dude, that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
Don't try and stop me, Stan! You don't know how it feels to be a deformed monstrosity!
Nah, I can't. We should help look for him.
No way dude. I'm gonna win the costume contest with this sweet Chewbacca costume.
I think we can do it, Stan. I've been close to a million a few times by myself.
Yeah, maybe that just kind of what they do naturally.
...And see? Here's one from Butters. It says, "We can't wait to see you back in school, Kenny." And it has a picture of him and you in a little airplane! 
That's more than ten bucks, you stupid fatass!
Come here!  You're not actually buying this crap, are you?!
That is not what happened! You totally started crying and quit the game!
Yeah, let's watch Yo Gabba Gabba, like old times.
Ask Jeeves? Nobody uses Ask Jeeves! Just Google-search it!
Hey, you know, that nurse is actually pretty cool.
Please you've, you've got to believe me! They've still gotta be here somewhere! Uh we've got to find them!
All right, let's just say all the bad things said about Mr. Jefferson are lies! Let's say the police department does just go around spending their time framing people for crimes they didn't commit!  Let's say it's all made up, and Mr. Jefferson is just a nice guy who's trying to be a child because he never got to have a childhood. Well that's fine, except for that he HAS children now! And when people have children, they have to grow up!
And it actually helps the crack babies. It's like volunteering but, but we just make a little on the side.
Hey, Tweek, you got anymore of this stuff?
That's retarded! You didn't come up with that experiment, Cartman, you saw it in that movie, The Thing!
Dude, our town is going to be better without the-  What the?
You've gotta try and stay on for ten seconds. Okay, Cartman?
Oh no you don't, Cartman! Every time we get put in a study group, you sit on your ass while the rest of us do all the work!
Goddammit, Cartman! You only got that because you knew my mom would buy it for me!
Look man, w-we know what you learned was pretty tough to hear.
Until we get people to stop downloading music for free, I say we refuse to play!
Hey man, if you're Jewish you get presents for eight days.
I'm gonna shove that thing up your ass!
Well, it's 3:30; I don't see any god-damned underpants gnomes, Tweek.
We've got work to do Stan, I think it takes a while for an elephant to get drunk.
If you want to make sure I'm not switching sides, Cartman, you don't have to worry. Stan is wrong.
This itches! Give me some of that calamine lotion, Cartman.
I don't know. But there's gonna be lots of food, and a band.
Well why don't you just tell people the truth?!
Huh? Well we don't really have that much money.
I know! It's so much worse than Catcher in the retarded Rye!
I'm just trying to fit in, Daddy. Don't be such a drama queen! 
Are you serious?? Look around: doesn't this bother you at all??  That's YOU one day, fatass! Not even one day! If you don't change something, that's you! In about a year! 
No! No, I'm not going to Peru! Not Peru! 
We have great news! Our friend has lost forty pounds eating your City Wok food. Here's the before and after photos.
Don't try to take me away again, Mom and Dad! I told you! I renounced the Jewish faith!
What the hell is wrong with these people?!
Mr. Hankey.  He comes out of the toilet every year and gives presents to everybody who has a lot of fiber in their diet.
Don't try and stop me, Stan! This is what my grandma wants!
Going to Afghanistan? Locked in a small space for 20 hours? How could things get any worse? 
Kenny, aren't you a little young for this?
Oh! Hey Cartman. We're playing dreidel; you wanna try?
See Cartman, your mom is on the cover.
It's worth a shot. Come on, you guys, we can do this.
Okay, fine. You know what? Let's just get it over with!
See? There you go again. Look at you dude. Look what you've become.
W-well, 'cause we want all of those fags to get out of town.
Hey Stan, we're gonna go to the movies.
Mr. Garrison, it's Kyle! Our egg is okay! We'll be there in a couple of minutes!
That's not what she said. You're putting extras on again. It's not that funny.
I know your family's poor, but you can't just eat an entire bowl of mints for dinner.
What are you doing with cats in your attic, fatass?!
It's about time, Kenny! Did you bring the pumpkin?
Will somebody just get me to a hospital? I need to get my stomach pumped!
Craig, if Cartman didn't do anything, then he doesn't deserve any of the credit!
Why didn't you tell me, Stam? I would've helped.
Nice old Mr. Johansen runs a candy shop! He wasn't a killer and you know it!
Well, you might have made it, but we're the ones who are taking care of it now. You have your own egg to look out for!
Hi. I've uh...  I've been saving up for a new Xbox game but... but I think you could use the money a lot more than I could. Listen I, I want you to take this.  It's twenty dollars. 
All right, I've had just about enough of this! They told us in school, and on TV, that most people in Pakistan and Afghanistan like America.
Hey, look. The aliens are getting ice cream.
No, that... I thought that was a lot.
Um I think we're just heading deeper into the mountains.
There's no Jews in San Francisco, you retard!
Wait. No wait a minute! I've got it. I've totally got it!
Hey, excuse me, but we need some help.
Well, we got some cigarettes, but we don't think you should be smoking. Each year, over a million people die of smo-
Well, our pig hasn't given birth yet, but she should anytime now.
Yeah. I bet they could make a fake set of balls. Come on, Butters!
Ah I was just trying to... just, just in one instance... No. No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
Stan, we're almost there. You've got to hold on.
Yeah, that's Cave of the Winds. It's a tourist attraction.
You bastards. Listen, we have to give a huge speech tomorrow about corporate takeovers.
I know! But that doesn't matter any more! These kids don't wanna play the game, they just wanna watch people on YouTube play it.
Dude! He turned Kenny into a duck-billed platypus.
Because some people think vaccinations can give you autism or Asperger's!
E-excuse me, my little brother needs medical attention.
Cartman, what the hell's the matter with you? 
Kenny, you're clearly his best friend. Go stop him.
Cartman, you are poor and you are stupid!
I didn't "bail," I got picked up by the government!
Broflovski looks for Kenny to get clear for the pass.
Phil Collins is playing Lalapalala's, and because we're all doing so well in school now, our parents said they would take us.
It's not new!! I'm gonna look "shit" up in the encyclopedia and prove it!!
We need to genetically engineer our pig and an elephant, but their genes won't splice.
I thought you said the wonder of Mother Nature was a beautiful thing.
Steve, you don't have to freeze yourself. Look!
The only thing of yours that's larger in size is your big fat ass!
Go look! It's all an ancient Incan prophecy.
What if they don't show the Terrance & Phillip trailer at all? What if we went through all of this for nothing?
Cartman!! Wake up you fat piece of crap!! 
Yeah, this all happened the day after he went to that concert!
I can't wait to watch Terrance & Phillip with Bebe.
Well. Dude, it's uh it's good to have you back.
Get out of here, you piece of garbage! You wanna smoosh, go creepin' somewheres else!
That's exactly what I wanted to hear from you all along. Ah uh I still have to take Butters, but... I hope things can be cool too.
Goodbye, Ike! Be safe! I'll come find you in Nebraska when Mom and Dad are back to normal!
They kind of look like us.  I mean, Stan's got blue eyes and I've got a sharper nose, but I mean, they kinda look like us.
Your girlfriend doesn't even like you, Stan the Man! She likes me!
Calm down, Tweek. There has to be a rational explanation.
You've never watched the news, fatass!  And what the hell does that have to do with anything?!
I am no longer an XBox guy! I let my friend get grounded, but today I will give him a PlayStation!
Wait a minute, Dad was the UPS man?
Dude, don't forget: Timmy is the only kid who can play Helen Keller. Don't piss him off.
What?! You were waiting for me in the bathroom!
Dude, what are we gonna do? We can't win this game.
There's still time to tell the network president you're full of CRAP! 
Dude, it's Cartman. He's just being a dumb-ass like always.
A woman pooping out her boobs is not good imagery!
Oh please, no reason! I got AIDS from him!
That's two against one, 'cause Stan doesn't care. So it's giant douche.
I didn't feel comfortable in that stuff, dude. I'm just being me.
Uh, oh, this, this is, the new retarded kid.
It's crazy, dude! They're saying it's because I agreed to the latest terms and conditions on iTunes!
Kenny didn't have the head lice, all right?!  It was me.
Yeah, dude. Your mom wanted you to have herpes on your face.
Your grandma left it to you! You didn't earn it!
Remember the time when we got an elephant to make love to a pig?
I knew it! You didn't plan 9/11 and you really didn't shoot that guy!
What the hell is that?  Oh my God. 
Alright, fine! Let's just get this stupid report over with!
Oh, you can pretend all you want! You're not fooling anybody!
Dad, I think Ike is starving to death. 
There's four white birds!  This is what Grandma wants? She wants me to attend Jewleeard.
I have an idea.  I don't like it, but I think it's the only choice we have.
No it isn't, you fat turd! Because, I've learned something today. You just hate-  See, I knew it.
Come out here and talk to me face to face! Open this door!
We're thinking that a lot of people in town starting too... 
You mean that we're forced to pay for the Oprah channel?
Don't be stupid, Cartman. Our teacher wouldn't be out lying in the forest waiting to kill us!
Really? Thanks, dude! I'm gonna go get a video camera! 
He was a McCain supporter.  It's okay, Ike. Obama will do fine.
Dad, if you agree to something but you didn't mean to agree to it, what do you do?!
You sold us out?! For an iPod Nano?!
They sneak out during class and make out in the hallways!
I just think I'd rather... control it instead of blame it on anything.
You mean you can see him?  Ah-I'm not crazy? 
I can't deal with it, Stan. I mean, all the stuff I've been reading; I really don't think I exist!
It is stupid and immature! So you got people to crap out of their mouths! What do you want, a feakin' medal?!
Yeah, that leprechauns were real! And the government just declared they AREN'T technically real, so I was right! It's over! I don't have to suck your balls!
I think the rabbit just crapped on my jacket.
I'm stoked my cousin is comin' to live with us. It'll be just like having a brother. 
How do we make three hundred thousand dollars doing that?
How dare she talk to us like that?!
So we were just wondering if we could sue somebody.
I don't know where Cartman is. I think something took him away.
I just wanted to see if maybe you want to do fingerpaints with me.
We put a stop to it, until YOU taught them Minecraft.
So I'm thinking we do the part about Jimmy's relationship with his alcoholic father after you smash Butters onto the table.
Yeah, this church kicks a-- Eh... I-it kicks!
We told him to grow up. So he got rid of his stuffed animals.
Okay. Just be careful you don't end up naked and jacking it in San Diego. 
The-that's not the right way to look at it, I-
Well, I turned off all my Apple stuff. They can't locate you if you don't have your stuff on, right? 
Oh, so big deal, guys! Do you feel better now? Clyde's the best looking kid in the class. And then Token and Stan, and last is Francis, Cartman, and...  Me?
It was really important for me to get an A, Stan. And Bebe said you were so reckless with your egg, so I made a fake one for you  and kept the original safe with me.
Well, sorry's not good enough! What are you gonna do about it?
Who cares if your dog is gay? Maybe it's not that bad.
It was like having the life sucked out of you. That' all it is, sliding down a cable. Maybe without a tour group it'd be ...kind of fun. Maybe. But, this was just... a complete disaster.
Yeah. But you know, I've learned something today. You see, the basis of all reasoning is the mind's awareness of itself. What we think, the external objects we perceive, are all like actors that come on and off stage. But our consciousness, the stage itself, is always present to us.
They found the butt-face people's son, Butters. They're gonna have a big reunion at the milk company!
I was just explaining how a negative argument doesn't make a po-
How hard can it be? Look at it. 
Because Butters isn't a total dick to me!
No, Butters. Look what it's done to you. It's made you even lamer than before.
You are gonna tell everyone that you lied and that we aren't a couple!
Can I have three thousand dollars, Mom and Dad, huh?? Can I??
Oh my God! You did lie to me.
Stan? Oh. Well, no, there's nothing here from Stan, but, well, Stan's gonna come and see you real soon, I bet, Kenny.
From who? We can't ask adults for help and there's nobody tougher than sixth graders.
Dude, when he gets out he's gonna be really mad!
Oh geez. Maybe we let this thing get out of hand. This issue is so complicated, but... m-maybe we sh-should just let Kenny go in peace.
You're not copying my homework, you lazy turd.
Pulling an episode because someone is offended starts a chain reaction. You'll have to pull more and more episodes until the show goes off the air completely. It's what happened to Laverne & Shirley.
You don't wanna go back to stinky Romania, do you? It sucks there.
Alright, look. I honestly don't know the secret, dude. Only Cartman does, and that's how it's gonna work for us.
"Get ready", "answer the door", Jesus Christ, make up your friggin' mind! 
I'm sorry. You must've been worried sick. I got your sled tangled up with a bus. 
If we win, we can buy a new go-cart that actually runs.
But he's just using his time on television to rant about-
Yeah, now what are we supposed to do?
Yeah, I think they already moved in. I saw moving vans in their driveway two days ago.
You just wanna lock me in there because you think I'm one of them.
Yeah, but that sucks, to get your butt kicked by a girl, Stan.
Phil Collins Hill on Saturday! You got it!
Yeah, but something is wrong with my brother and it might be your fault!
What?! Timmy! You've got to get off that chair!
Look, he knows full well what he's doing, and he's just waiting for us to buy into it, and then he'll laugh and point at our faces and say, "Haha, I got you guys to believe me!" "You guys are stupid!"
No, dude! We have to name it Steve.
Wait! Wait a minute.  What about a logic loop?
Okay, I'm gonna go grab mine. I have an idea.
Uuuh, Chef, you haven't seen Butters around, have you?
And then like, out of nowhere, somebody came up with the idea of ziplining.
No, no, no.  We want to make little pot-bellied elephants that people can keep in their houses as pets.
That's not what I was trending! They took my hash tag and they raped it! Where is Ike?!
I'm declaring Shenanigans on you! This game is rigged!
Cartman, we should probably talk about our chances.
Boy, it looks like you're not welcome anywhere elephant.  See ya. 
It's Mr. Hankey! He hasn't shown up yet.
Well, I mean, all last week you were ripping on ginger kids and now you are one.
Goddammit Cartman, will you stop wasting time? I wanna get this over with!
There! You see?! This is what happens when Cartman is allowed his right to free speech!
You aren't gonna cut off his wee wee. Not today, you sick-ass weirdo!
I'll give you five bucks to eat your puke.
Well I wish I didn't have any parents! 
Who took all the pizza and the cake?  What the hell?
I can't wait until the teacher yells at us this time, and we all tell her to suck our balls!
All right! We're getting the hell out of here! 
Yeah, sorry dude uh, I can't make it either.
Yummy yummy I want your farts in my tummy.
Because you're my little brother, Godddamnit!  And even when I'm fifty and you're forty-five, you're still gonna be my little brother!
Yes, I know that! Why do you think I've been putting up with his farts?!
Yeah, but Cyborg Bill is totally gay now. Please Mom? Everybody else has Chinpokomon.
Come on, Steve, you're going to Des Moines!
Oh, Jesus, this bus is going fast!  Oh, I did it again!!
Uh. All I did was show her how to-
We're so sorry. Please forgive my little brother. He's going through puberty.
No way! There's no real connection between us. It was all a big lie.
Maybe they took it literally when we said we wanted to adopt a kid.  Whoa! That was cool.
Whoa! They gave you an anal probe Cartman?
Yeah. We have a report to do, asshole! Get up! Get up!! 
But I can't, because, what if thinking about it is the only thing keeping my space-time together? 
Well, so then WWE will recruit us and not them.
You guys, do you really care what a bunch of girls have to say about how you rank in looks?! 
Yeah, it was cool, thanks.  Um, so... Is there any way you'd
Well if I'm going down, Cartman's going down!
Oh, thanks.  Dude, that new girl's into me!
We need him to win a bullriding contest so we can get Terrance and Phillip dolls. Can he still do it?
You assholes stole our client! How about some Goddamn business ethics?!
Dude, my mom won't even let me have a hamster.
Cartman, that's the dumbest thing you've ever said - this week!
Eminem, Justin Timberlake, Hootie... They all have agents. You need somebody to manage it all for you.
We promised each other we would never do that, remember?
Our little man is growing up, Stan. He's growing up.
Well, I don't know...  and I'll bet Cartman doesn't know either!
Ike, Ike, you have to be honest. Am I ugly, yes or no?  You ALL think I'm ugly. Jesus Christ, the least you could have done is told me!
Nah, my mom packed me a kosher lunch.
Cartman, you fucking hunk of fat, rat-fucking hunk of pig-fucking ass fat.
Well ah I guess in wrestling we're supposed to make our own outfit, and then wear it over this.
Not if you... have some delicious farts for me.
Yeah, but now you can be friends with all of us!
Mom, Dad!  They're gonna kill her! They're going to in-. Wait, what are you doing here?
Hey, how do we know if she's pregnant?
He'd be better used as a coat rack. 
He's right, dude. We have to define our style if we're ever going to make a platinum album. I mean, ah I'm a fusion guy, but Kenny's background is more Latin Jazz.
Yeah. Good job, wizard fat ass! Now we're totally lost.
Hello? Will you just give this guy something, please?!
Ha, Goddamnit!  Haaa. Ohhhh. Ahh, ohh, uhh, agh, 
Aw, stop it, Cartman! Your hand hand doesn't need to breathe!
Yeah, It was seriously the most manly thing that's ever happened.
I think Clyde is kind of cool, but Craig is definitely cooler than Clyde.
This is the worst day of my life.
He is working for the Wall-Mart to stop us from succeeding!
Yeah. See, we got you to fight just 'cause we wanted to see who was the toughest. We made up all that stuff we said to get you guys mad at each other. 
Nope! We're gonna have all the pizza you can eat, twenty different cakes, and Lorde is going to play live!
Look, my fat bastard friend is trying to trick the network into getting Family Guy off the air.
You know what I mean! Why is my little brother watching you talking about us talking about him?!
All I wanted was to play one level of Call of Duty and you know what Ike told me? He said the living room was for old people.
I hate you, remember?  You wanna be partners, Jimmy?
Yeah, and if you couldn't prove there was a leprechaun, you have to give me ten dollars! Now just pay up and stop being stupid!
Yeah, there's this guy named Jack Leborkian that goes around and murders people that ask him to, and he doesn't get in any trouble at all.
Alright, alright! Knock it off! Stop spreading lies.
I know! But that doesn't matter any more! These kids don't wanna play the game, they just wanna watch people on YouTube play it. And you know why? Commentary.
But I'll get snow on my gloves and then it will melt and I'll have wet hands.
Dude, what actually makes total sense about it, if you look at it, is that the crack babies are finally getting some attention and the care that they need.  Yeah. It's pretty cool, dude. Because most of these babies would normally not even get out, you know? Huh, or be able to do anything.  Just because we are making money doesn't mean that those babies aren't benefiting. It isn't exploiting them. They're finding a useful place in society. What's so unethical about that? 
Somebody bet on you, Jesus. You said yourself that one person still had money on you.
From public school, your house is just a flicker of light.  Don't you want to go out? All you do is... stay in your house and... study
This is what God told us to do!
No. Then I came into this virtual space.
Do you think kids in every town have to deal with this crap?
There's no way we can go all the way back. We'll never make it now!
I'm sorry, Cartman. There's been a little change in plans!
...french fries...pizza...pizza...pizza-french fries... I wonder where our parents are.
Chr, what could you possibly have in your room that could change the outcome of the election? 
I'm not cheesing. I've never cheesed once in my life.
If you really think every kid in America should see your anti-bullying movie, then why don't you put it on the Internet for free?!
Look, I doubt we could break a million together anyway.
This would have never happened if you would have let Kenny be a princess in the first place!
Well!  You're gonna be sorry when you see me riding around on Santa's sleigh with Mr. Hankey, fatass!
No, no, uh I wanna be tall and black.
Yeah, he was too young to be taken from us.
Guess what? You're not my best friend anymore! Cartman's my new best friend!
Hey Texans! Let me through; we want a treaty!
Let's take a test sample: There's four of us, you're a retard, that's one-fourth.
Cartman, he's got everyone on Sony's side. We can't stop him!
You dirty son of a bitch, you never told us that we had to win-
Yeah, well people should  know that peeing in pools is  bad!
What do you think, Stan. These girls are pretty cute, huh?
We don't have time for this! Kenny, keep him away from us! 
I know that I'll have to testify, that I'll have to... relive what I saw that day.  But I can't let Spielberg and Lucas get away with it. Not this time. Even if I have to do it alone.
Could I please one of your piping-hot farts in my mouth?
Is this all you brought us here to see?
It isn't fair. Cartman's fatter than the goal.
I didn't suck his balls, all right?! And I'm not going to!
Original zombie? Well, how the hell do we know who the original zombie is?!
Yeah, Cartman, you're swimming around in first-grader pee.
D-hude, this is gonna be so killer. They're all gonna get herpes!
But where are we gonna get the money to buy costumes and and the instruments? 
You said we have no idea that you're never let us hurt Wall-Mart!
I don't know what else to do, dude. No matter what I try, me and Ike just seem to drift further apart!
Yeah dude, like, full-on. Ike saw everything. It totally makes sense now. My mom's been ordering all kinds of stuff from Amazon lately. Sometimes, sh-she doesn't even remember what she's ordered. She's probably been having sex with the UPS man for a long time.
Wow, dude, check it out! We can win Terrance and Phillip dolls. 
He does kind of look like him dude. And Kenny thinks Cartman's Gordon Ramsay impersonation is really good.
Yeah. And my powerful nunchakus make me into Bunroku , a deadly but compassionate ninja who protects those in trouble.
Get the hell off me! You're a freak, Butters! You can't play with us!
Do you think we can still make it in time?
Oh, like you know what pain is! Go try living in a Third-World country, you little pussy!
Seriously, Cartman. You could make money with these!
Dude! What if Cartman really does succeed? And we really do have to be his slaves??
We've had just about enough, dude! You've been blowing us off for two weeks now! What's up?!
Hey, that went really well. They really liked it.
I just want a nurection so I can give it to my mom.
Chef, do you know where "shit" comes from?
We're all here today because Chef has been such an important part of our lives. A lot of us don't agree with the choices Chef has made in the past few days.  Some of us... feel hurt... and confused that he seemed to turn his back on us.  But we can't let the events of the last week take away the memories of how much Chef made us smile.  I'm gonna remember Chef as the jolly old guy who always broke into song.  I'm gonna remember Chef... as the guy who gave us advice to live by.  So you see, we shouldn't be mad at Chef for leaving us. We should be mad at that little fruity club for scrambling his brains.
Well, all I can say is, he's better have Nintendo.  Well, here's Kenny's house.
Look, Stan, you want me to just take care of this egg?
Dude. What the hell is wrong with you?
This is exactly what you would do if they found lice in your hair! Try to lead the charge against somebody else to take the suspicion off of yourself!
Eh I, I don't know what else to paint.
Ya see Ike? There's nothing. There's nothing for you to be afraid of.
Dude, because of the electoral college these votes in swing states can really matter.
Because they're an addictive solution to a greater problem, causing disease of both body and mind with consequences far outweighing their supposed benefits.
It's the only way to prove to them that you're real.
Aw, come on. Ned's faking it. That frog was just a piece of plastic!
You need to stop recommending that app to people!
The whale's name is Willzy-x, and he told us he's dying on our planet. We've come up wth a plan, but we're gonna need all of your help to make it work.
But you know, I've learned something today. I've learned that people who want power, a lot of power, always... end up dead.
Yeah, you can't get it if you don't breathe.
Hey!  How about Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo?
We think that you might have could it by helping make "shit" an everyday word. 
Doctor, could we talk to her for a minute?
Some high schoolers left their marijuana cigarette behind. Uh we have to throw it away before some kids find it or something.
The atmosphere is oxygen-based, should support our breathing.
Because we're not referring to gay people! You can be gay and not be a fag.
What has Michael Jackson always tried to be?
I couldn't get in to see the principal, Ike.
But we've been playing for eight hours. We can't think of anything else to do.
Well, cou, couldn't just you know, get rid of the part of Tooth Decay?
Don't let him touch you! You die if he touches you!
Good thing we made those changes to the seating.
I told him 5:30 and we gotta get going. You in?
Wow, level nine already? Dude, you kick ass in "Heaven versus Hell."
Look out! Here comes the great dragon of Perengraph!
No. And I don't want to. Look Stan, maybe we should fo- 
Dude, some people really do consider this obscene.
Clyde got $3000 from his mom's life insurance
Oh my God! I killed Kenny! You bastard!
Not Cartman, he gets to be on TV anyway.
Goddamnit, you know I don't carry gold in a little bag around my neck, Cartman! Whattaya want from me?!
Damnit! How come every time we get a sweet idea, the government has to screw it up?!
Dude! All those choirs are the same. They don't even really sing. They use prerecorded tapes.
Dude, everyone's trying to figure out who you are.
I'm sure we're gonna get word any minute that people have agreed to stop. 
Look, Stan. When Kenny died I learned how important friends are. I'm not gonna lose another friend.
Yeah. So hurry up and die, you piece of crap! 
Maybe they should project the movies on Cartman's ass. 
Google him. He's this guy from Sweden who has over 30 million YouTube subscribers. We didn't even know, but he's a bigger celebrity to kids than anyone. It just seems so lame.
No! Because you'll just crap out your butt and then say it came out of your mouth!
Hey! Hey!  Who the hell told you to put this thing back up?!
But before he could go through with this entire plan, he discovered that the pie had already been eaten...  ...by your dog. 
You don't understand what my mom will do to me if she finds out I was playing with weapons!
Okay. Okay, you're right.  Oh uh Cartman: thanks.  Cartman?  What the hell? 
Because without big corporations we wouldn't have things like cars and computers and canned soup.
No.  But I get Channukah presents for eight days.
Nobody wants any of your stuff, you fat bitch!
Mom, there might be something that you should look into about Ike staying after school all the time-
What?! You said we had plenty of money, Cartman!
How do we know which one to use?
Rainbows are those little arches of color that show up during a rainstorm.
Yeah, why don't you go eat some more pork rinds or something, you fat fuck?! 
Yeah. I think we should get the hell out of here.
Stan, this has gone too far. People are going to get hurt. What you started is way out of control.
I'm never gonna win that two tons of candy looking like everybody else!
No he didn't kill him, he's still breathing!  Get up!  Get UP! 
Did you guys hear what's going on? There's like four girls at the school now offering to kiss boys for money.
We're missing out on some quality video game time right now.
Come on, dude. All you gotta do is eat it very fast!
I hate being small and Jewish. I feel like a tall black man.
You couldn't get both arms behind your back, fatass!
What the hell is wrong with you, Cartman? Haven't you noticed the three feet of snow on the ground?
Yeah. Did you make out with him, too?
Hey, Cartman, do you think God's getting mad at you for not making $10 million? 
Hey. Hey, look over there, Stan. That Raisins girl is really cute, huh?  Why don't you say hi to her?  Excuse me? 
Well, but, this is the jacket I always wear.
What?? "A-ight"'s not cool, either? When did that happen?
The only way you can cancel it out is to get Butters to put your wiener in his mouth.
The girls do not have a device that shows them the future Cartman. That's retarded.
So can I go to the Magic Camp, to learn how to become a full member? All the other guys are doin' it, and it's only $69.95.
I mean, come on guys, that's pretty cool, right? My little brother is a knight in Canada. 
All I wanted was to play one level of Call of Duty and you know what Ike told me? He said the living room was for old people.
Nobody gives a crap about your Trapper Keeper, Cartman! 
Hi. We were wondering why fatass  I mean, Cartman, hasn't been showing up for school.
You guys, we can't let him do this!
He catches the feesh so, then he can make money.
Oh, my ears feel like they're frozen off, and I think I have a hemorrhoid from sitting on the sled for so long.
Cool! Maybe we can do that to Cartman's cat.
There is a crisis in America! As families grow further and further apart-
A ladder to heaven.  We build it, climb up, and get our winning ticket back from that asshole Kenny.
And afterwards, he'll probably have to burn his hand and bury it.
...Mr. Hankey! Hoh, we were so worried! I was waiting up for you and you didn't come, so I thought that-
All right, you see, Clyde. Okay, we wanna help him sue whoever invented the toilet.
Kenny, we know you really like this girl, but...
Are you saying that Ike has been given regular doses of hormones because of an IntelliLink screwup?!
Why would the government want people to believe they caused 9/11?
Okay, then let's take him to the hospital. You hear that, fatso!  You're goin' to the hospital!
We want all the country to see that Kenny is alive, and in pain!
Sorry, sorry. You know how after we spent the night at Kenny's house and-and you and Cartman got sick with chickenpox?
No, see? There's people of all colors. And they added a black guy as one of the hangers, too, so it's not racist.
Well I don't know. You're just the only grownup we trust.
There. Do you really want that asshole to win?
I'm going to New York to kill the Queer Eye For the Straight Guy people!
All right I've had enough! Leprechauns are imaginary!
I guess we should all realize...  that history and alien technology really do go hand in hand. 
Dude, we're gonna go sneak into Cartman's and change him back into a non-ginger!
We're not basing research for our report on this crap!
Then I can give it to my dad. 
It's no use. There's nobody around for miles.
It's not enough! Ever since Kenny switched sides, there are more kids that wanna go with PS4 on Black Friday.
Alright, Cartman! What's so important you had to pull us away from lighting cow crap on fire?!
Give it up, Kenny! You're not gonna win that costume contest! Your costumes always suck. 
Cartman, don't be such a baby! We're supposed to be rugged outdoorsmen!
We have to confess that we were the ones that-
Dude, why aren't people coming to help us?
Cartman was right! The holiday season is for idiots!
Well... maybe I'll take just half a hit of acid.
No I'm not! God damn it Cartman, you're not gonna kill me off again!
It's too bad Cartman can't be here to enjoy this.
But it's not fair! We have to do a full report on the Founding Fathers, and Cartman got out of helping us again!
Then stop saying you're not just sure, you're HIV-positive!  This isn't funny, AIDS isn't funny, dying isn't funny, so shut the fuck up!
What the hell is that lady talking about?
So, just to be completely clear, now it isn't funny, right?
Fine! But when you're naked and jackin' it in San Diego, don't ask me for help! 
How many tickets can we put you down for?
Is that what you learned in sex ed?
Hey, where's the school bus? We're gonna be late for football practice. 
No! No God damn it no! I'm telling you you're wrong! There, there's no way I can have HIV! Unless maybe...  Oh my God. That son of a bitch! 
I'm sorry.  I I'm sorry, I can't do this.  I'm not doing this. 
Uh alright, sorry kid. Gue- guess we have the wrong house.
But we actually are busy. Tonight's the big fight.
What was it about? Ih-in case our teacher asks us.
Ike found out last night. My mom's having sex with the UPS man.
Well, Cartman, thanks to you we don't have any money left to win the Terrance and Phillip dolls!
I saved up enough to buy M-80s this year.
Yeah, but you know? I think you've learned something today. You've learned that you can't rewrite history.  You see, history is forever,  and everything happens for a reason.  Sure, you can try and change the past, but usually you kno-
Hey. They've never been allowed to walk before. They just don't know how.
Yeah, you are! You always get in trouble
Car... Cartman! You've gotta swim! Kick with your legs!
No, Ike! Ma, Ike keeps taking off his Squirt uniform!
Aw, don't be such a baby!  You do it, Kenny.
No matter what we think, it's not just a passing trend. We need to realize that the new generation of entertainment is here.  And I, think that's great.
Let's go. Oh my God, that smells good. 
Yep. But I guess this proves that war is the natural order of life.
Guys, guys, I know we're all concerned, but we have to work together!
Why do people have to keep reminding us of what we don't have?!
No! Dude! I want the Terrance and Phillip dolls up there.
So then where did the eight hundred dollars we made from selling an Internet ad to Payless Shoe Source go?
I'm sure. Abe Lincoln was right: I don't wanna find out I'm good-looking and become a total shithead when I grow up.
Dude! I aced that test! I'm gonna win that dinner with Ms. Ellen!
Cartman? Come on, dude. You have to get up.
I don't think it's gonna be that hard to keep it from breaking. This whole assignment is stupid.
Oh yeah?! Well you're a stupid Jew! You're a Jew! Shut your God-damned Jew mouth! Good job, Jew! Jew... Shut up, Jew! You're Jewish!! Dude, he's Jewish! Jew! Jew! Jew! Jew! Jew! Jew! Jew?! "I told you Jewish people don't have rhythm." "Fuck off, Cartman!"
You can't sit with us, new kid. Go find another table! 
This whole time your stupid story was just a way to rip on me for being Jewish at Christmas again!
You did it, Mr. Hankey. You brought back the spirit of Christmas!
Mph. Okay, Mr. Hankey. We're out. How are you doin'?
D-ude, I totally miffed that middle part. Did you see that?
Ohh, right, you're supposed to pull and master-benate your wiener really fast.
Don't listen to 'em, Cartman! I'm sure it'll work. Go for it. Yaaay, Cartman! Fly, fly, fly!
Wait a minute! I've got it! The bullriding contest. Cartman could ride a bull, and try to win $5000.  Think about it, dude: $5000. That's 1000 set of balls. That's 3000 balls! We'd have to win enough to get the dolls!
Oh, no thanks. We don't do that stuff.
Shhh. Willzy-x, don't say anything. We're gonna bust you out of here.
I'll give you ten bucks to eat it.
Well, actually, Cartman's getting a nurection. But then, we're gonna give it you. Sooo, buck up! 
Well, he has this new teacher's assistant, and uh and they're both... totally gay.
Cartman, what the hell are you doing here?! You quit!
You won't get more votes than us, asshole!
Wow! Oh, and look over there, that's that Jake Jabs guy from American Furniture Warehouse commercials. 
Chef, CHEF! You need to get out of here before you get arrested, all right?!
Our lives have not been enjoyable, Trent! I promise you! 
There are greater things at work than what you understand.
No, I was taking a crap, and I heard you guys talking!
They're just taking Indiana Jones and they're...  they're raping him! 
Wait! Stop! Could I have your attention, please?
Yeah. Cartman's weight was what gave us speed, so we need to find the next-fattest kid besides Cartman. 
The... girls at school. They made a list and voted me the ugliest boy.
Listen, guys, I appreciate you wanting me around, but, the fact of the matter is, well, yeh, you guys are just kind of douche bags.
This is terrible, dude! Maury Povich parades these poor people around on his show like carnival freaks! And then gives them prizes at the end after they joked about it. What a dick!
But our teacher, Mr. Garrison? He just had his penis made into a vagina. How come?
You don't wash your hands after going to the bathroom!
Sssoo aside from all the bull crap, what do ya think of the Oculus?
Ssso it was all for nothing. The whole time I was... eating farts for nothing.
We're not fucking you, they're fucking Stan's grandpa!
Come on, Blanket! We gotta go before your dad sees us. 
You sent us over to Kenny's house on purpose! You wanted us to get sick!
Oh, you're just saying that because he brings you candy.
Hey, wait a minute.  Is it possible that...
Tomorrow's trial, Everyone vs. Everyone, is gonna make things a lot worse! We have to stop it!
What the hell is wrong? "Can't find the server" Kickstarter. 
We don't even understand how this game is played.
Butters! Hey Butters! You have to check this out!
Then we should go to the record company. My dad's a lawyer, dude; he tells me about this stuff all the time.
When Towelie is doing heroin, he doesn't care about anything.
Where are you going?  Ike, where are you going?
Well... what kind of stuff does she like? Do you know?
A-all right, let's split up and look for a passageway. E-everyone take a different direction.  Oh man, we're in big trouble here.
I wonder how come Cartman's not in school today?
Fuck you! Why would they send you in to convince me of anything?!
It was really about the most man thing I think we've ever been a part of.
Um, we... sssort of spend all the money on this... one...
He's a talking piece of poo that lives in the sewer. But now he's getting sick because his egosystem is all out of whack because of all the extra poo in the sewer. If you don't all leave and go home soon, Mr. Hankey's gonna die. He's one of my best friends in the whole wide worldeh, and I don't want him to die. 
Dude, we have got to get that kid away from him!
I'm going to break everything that you own! 
This is when you gotta get mean, Tweek.
Dude, where is she gonna get fetus clothes?
Well, let's see how he likes the icy blasts from my nunchucks of Sokuromoto! 
You see? Nothing, dude. Just a bunch of stars.
You're trying to confuse me now, aren't you?
Butters, people can't just go around beating up people who have diabetes! Now whatever your problem is, you just-
Oh, hi. Is Chef here? We have to talk to him.
We're already doing a paper on Tweek's underpants gnomes.
Okay. We won't tell anybody as long as you are super nice to us, every day, from now on.
We've gotta do something, Chef. If we don't we don't stop that network,  "shit" will become an even more acceptable word!
Did you eat too many pork rinds last night? 
Hey! I'm doing it to save little baby cows. I'm not gonna stop eating meat altogether.
No thanks. We're trying to unbrainwash our friend.
Oh, you are so full of crap, Cartman! Metal spikes will not come out!
But... we were so close... I'm sorry, Willzy-x. We tried.
I know it's hard to think about, but you have to be strong. Remember how that movie made you feel.
And this kid is watching Cartman commenting on people commenting on Dragon Age.
What the hell would you know you fat sweaty Mongoloid, you never get higher than a 'D'!
Nobody else is going to help him, you guys. We've got a chance to do something pretty special here. Are you with us?
If you guys want there to be a Christmas, you'd better come help me!
No! We can't divide like this!  Stan?  You're on our side, right?
Oh, Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay.
No, Cartman, I have no idea what you're talking about!
I mean, I do, but, well, ever since I became friends with that Kip Drordy kid, a bunch of my other friends have started ignoring me. It would be fine except for my farm is starting to shrink. I know that I should just dump Kip as a friend, but that's such a terrible thing to do and, I'm sorry I'm just so confused I... I really need a friend right now.
Hey, thanks for going through all that to save my life, Stan.
We need some more fur.  I think that's good.
Dude, we'll have Chef's $2 million in no time!
All right, this is it! If Wall-Mart has a heart, we have to find it and destroy it! No matter what the Wall-Mart does to try to stop us, we have to be strong! Let's do it.
Please, you have to listen to me! The prophecy actually did come true!
Ooh, who the hell cares? He's not even my responsibility.
You guys, we've just been screwed over and lied to!
Yeah. And now you can take that stupid beard off! 
I, I know it's tough but-  Look at me!  I know it's tough, okay?! I know! But we have to be tough right now!
Hold it.  Pops, I've got the music inside me. It's in my soul. And I know my place is up on that stage. I'm gonna make it to the top. And I just want your blessing, Pops.
What?! Does everybody have to do it, or just me?
This part kinda sucks, Kenny, but don't screw it up. 
Dude, thanks for helping us out by joining our team.
Alright, alright, let's get this over with so we can put her back!
Cartman, there are people in the world who really have Tourette's Syndrome. This isn't funny!
Yeah. I guess that's the point. I don't think we're gonna understand. Maybe this IS all the beginning of a new art form. YouTube celebrities are only getting bigger. And what's great is that these people are inventing themselves, instead of being marketed and shoved down our throats.
Wait. Stan?  Hold on, is this my virtual reality, or Cartman's virtual reality?
We couldn't get trapped here forever, Cartman. We'd die after a couple of days. 
I don't need Ike listening to you comment on anything!
All Wall-Marts start a self-destruction sequence if you break a mirror in the back.
Dude, that would have to be like, the best party ever.
Then why did Butters say he helped you sneak into my room last Friday night?! 
Nah. Dude, I c-I can't go to have a birthday party while Butters is missing.
Yeah, fatass, we're gonna dig up-  Dig up Kyle's dead grandma??
Mr. Jefferson said we can invite all the kids in town to go play over at their house.
Fine. That's it. I give up. Have fun being miserable.
Do you really think that this is good for Butters? To have his face put up all over signs as the poster child for bullying?
Oh no, don't try to pin this on me! You're the one who brought it up!
This is just startin' to look like another one of those times where it-it's gonna end up with the whole town turning out, it's a big showdown happening, and us havin' to talk about what we learned, and I say we just stop right now, and go play cards or something.
Come on, we have to finish the quest in Stonehaven. 
No you're not, dude! You're a guy in a panda costume! 
...Yeah. Or we could just show our asses.
It's not a game, you derelict! And this isn't Scotch! It's apple juice! 
So what should we do now? It's Saturday and we have to have as much fun as possible.
He knew he had to take us all home, too, right?
These producers making a big holiday special!  They had me upload a video for a commercial they're about to air! They said my hash tag was awesome, and they wanted to promote it!
You're having nightmares about the ending to World War Z again?
Oh God, here we go again! 9/11 was not a conspiracy, fatass!
I've been thinking, how did shamelessness get to this?  Did it start with fat people on scooters? Or did the bar get lowered way before that? And then I started thinking, maybe it was us.  I don't know, but maybe somehow, we lowered the bar, a long time ago.  And now we're all sittin' here in the stink of it all.  There's no going back, Stan. 
Get the bull in the balls with a snowball.
Just let it go with your fucking balls, you fucking asshole!! Your friends have been in danger and all you care about it this stupid bet! Well I've decided, Cartman, even if we had a bet, that I am never sucking your balls,  you got that?! They can throw me in jail for the rest of my life, but I am  never going to suck your balls,  never! So  there!
Do you really think that beating up a handicapped kid is being nice? 
It's just sending images of cities and people and stuff.
Well come on! We gotta tell you what happened. I'm sure glad it's over with. 
Your husband.  He wanted that pie badly, but he knew that he was not allowed to eat it yet.
'Cause, r-tard, he's Stan from the future. He knows everything Stan knows.
I'm not going in any meat locker so you can trap me!
Come on, Nurse Token. We're gonna play football, you puss.
Dammit! Son of a bitch, dammit!  Oh, sorry.
...Dude, you're supposed to vote for Giant Douche.
Dude! Timmy's chair is packed with all that stuff! We've gotta help him!
Garrison is taking us all on a field trip today. He wants to do the final egg check in front of the Governor's office!
It seems like I might get splinters, though.
Oh, we're just makin' a cradle out of an egg carton for our egg. We figure that way it'll be easier to keep safe so we can get an A.
I don't know. Ever since he was in that movie, he got all famous.
Well, thanks for everything, you guys. You really helped us see how important parents are.
You'll never turn ME into a metrosexual! I like being a dirty, filthy little boy!
He'll view it as a challenge when he's getting his ass kicked!
Don't panic. I'll tell you what to say.  You can tell them...
Aaaarrghhhhhh!  I'm not one of them! Do you understand me?! You'd better get that through your fat head! I will never be one of them, and if you say it again, I swear to God, I'll smash your fucking teeth in! 
Then I guess I'll see you on Black Friday.
I got beat up at school... for being different.
Jambu! Jambu, why didn't you speak up before?
Yes. I'm saying one-fourth of Americans are retards.
Wwait, what do you mean? Stan's in danger?
There it is!  That must be of the antelope family.
Well, I just found out I'm a sex addict. I'm so scared, I haven't even told my mom yet.
Uh, could you use it in a sentence?
Okay, hang on guys. I'll use my special power to see into the future and find out where we should head next.
Really? Great! I don't have to worry about that anymore. 
Ike! Ike! Wake up buddy! Wake up! Ike, you've gotta wake up, please!  Eh there you go. That's good.  Oh Ike. I thought I lost you, little brother.
They laughed hardest at our video. We're gonna win!  We're gonna win!
How could we know she would... Aw we suck so hard.
Huuh, I wah... just ah... well... that's all. 
That can't be true! My parents wouldn't do that!
That's a retarded idea that won't work. Why are you really doing this?
Do you know what happened to me this morning, Stan? This morning... I woke up and felt a sharp pain in my ass. I felt down there and, and found this... big sore lump. On my ass, Stan. I couldn't even sit down, so... I, I had to tell my mother, which, which was humiliating. She took me to the doctor, which was more humiliating, a- a- nd he told me. I-I have a hemorrhoid. It's like an infected blood vessel on your ass. I'm nine years old, and I have a hemorrhoid, Stan. I have a hemorrhoid, and, Cartman has his own theme park.
Can you act like you're giving him a lot?
Look, Cartman, I don't know what's gotten into you, but... I I think it's pretty amazing. And I think it's real. You have to understand why I didn't believe you before.
God? Please, if you get me out of this, I swear, I will never play with weapons ever again.
Yeah, isn't he just supposed to be learning how to read?
"No, please! I promise I'll never make another album or movie!"
Thanks for saving us Stan. You're my Super Best Friend.
Mr. Hankey.  He comes out of the toilet every year and gives presents to everybody who has a lot of fiber in their diet.
I don't want to kill myself. They rigged this thing to fill with water! 
It's too much power. For anybody. Stan's right. It has to be destroyed.
I am not full of meecro- what? Look, the word "shit" first showed up in English in the 1340s, the same time as something called, "The Black Death".
All right, all right, you could be Jesus, you tubby cry-baby!
You were sticking these in your ass, Cartman?!
Then don't belittle my people you fuckin' fatass!
We need some help identifying an ancient English stone.
I won't believe it! I won't! I have to ask my mom and dad! 
It isn't fair!  I don't want to be an outcast!
Stan, you can use family love as a weapon against Shelly.  The next time she's gonna kick your ass, just tell her, "Shelly, you're my sister, and I love you."
Hey dude, ah are you the guys messing with Cartman's stuffed animals?
"And as the voluminous corporate automaton bulldozes its way through bantam America...
Why the hell would they want that anyway?  Episode I sucked balls.
You're not getting away with this, you fat turd! 
But it's... it's not true they... have no souls. 
Uh, hi. Our friend joined your club a while back, and now he wants to molest kids. 
This whole time your TV is in a house with nobody in it?!
You son of a bitch! I won't let you win! You hear me?!
I got some sound advice... from an old friend. 
You just want Family Guy off the air...
Dammit, Cartman, you are such a fat fuck!
Ma'am, we are a very important talent agency. If your producers knew you were forcing people of our stature to the back of the line, well-
We need everyone's help here. What you're looking for are big boxes of ballots. Hundreds of them. Please check your basement, your attic, and-
Well, let's just try to finish all this coffee, so we can stay up.
...star-starting to become alienated from some of your friends.
Yeah. Just when he was being accepted he has to leave and start over.
Cartman doesn't always win! He just gets pissed off and goes home so we can't debate anymore!
This is where the elders meet. Nobody is allowed to go in there when they're having a meeting.
My God-damned little brother's trying to follow me to school, again!
Butters, you have to tell us what Cartman is up to!
Hey, Pip. Do you wanna be on my team again?
Mom, it was nothing. Mohammad just stood there and then drank some tea.
You guys are so good you'll probably go all the way to win the national title!
What do you mean? We thought she was with you.
I think Stan might've been right. Anyway, I think it's going too far. I mean, if I kill myself, it's gonna make my family really sad.
Get out of here, Cartman, we're eating dinner!
I got it! I got it! According to PayPal, the Russian guys are just hired mercenaries who had ads up on Craig's List and got paid through eBay so that Boston could be attacked by... the British.
Yeah. But I have to say, I feel a lot better now.
You guys, who cares if the girls make some stupid list? Girls make dumb lists all the time.
This is your fault, Cartman! Now we're gonna fail!
Gee, you seem a little stressed, Mr. Garrison. Why don't you try some Ritalin? 
We got Cartman's pig so we can splice its genes with my elephant's.
Then don't eat 14 Egg waffles for lunch, fatass!
Oh no! They ruined my life! I get to kill them first!
We have to watch them! We can't miss it!
I actually hugged you. I held you in my arms and, and, cried with you.
Sweet. I made mine go off the jump. 
Ah-ah-ah-are wooden desks all that available? I usually prefer the plastic ones because these give me splinters.
Hey, Butters!  I got tickets to go see Lion King tonight, and I decided to invite  YOU before anybody else.
Dude, I know you're pissed at me right now. You've gotta understand that I did it because I know in my heart that the XBox is better, for all of us.
Come on, Kenny. You have to get in the circle.
Well, as Abraham Lincoln, I accept your surrender, and agree to your conditions. You and all the Confederates will have all the S'more Schnapps you can drink for a year.
Dude, I just found out that everybody pees in pools. Why would I go back?
How exactly are we gonna use her to scare them?
Now look! The reason we're in this situation is because people are being stupid! The economy isn't some vengeful being that takes things away from us. The economy is just made up of people, and people have just lost their faith in it.  What people really should be doing is spending more. Spending is fine. People should just go outside. People should just go outside. They should buy the things they need for their friends and family
Yeah, what's this about? We should be writing our monologues for Smackdown.
Yeah! So you gotta bust out of here.  So we made you this cake.  There's a ailnay ilefay inside of it.
I heard you won't even get in the deep end.
Nah, let him make a complete ass out of himself for a little while longer. 
I was trying to make an appointment to see the principal about getting excused on Friday. So I can take my brother to go see Yo Gabba Gabba Live.
This is so retarded, Cartman. You've got everyone believing your stupid story.
Whoa Cartman. Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night.
We live. That's what Indy would have wanted. We just try... to live.
So I guess this means we get to keep our weapons.
...You put Kenny's picture on a milk carton??
Why are you people doing this? Why would you lie like this? To children?
All right, fine. I'll do the dumb test.
Hello, ma'am. My name is Kyle. And this is Cartman. We'd like to share our interest in David Blaine with you.
So we've gotta find another way out of here.
Well at least my mom's not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!
See, when you start invading people's privacy, eh thinking it's harmless to put up pictures of them they didn't want up - Kenny! - you start a domino effect that eventually screws everything up for everybody!
Get back on, fatass! You have to practice!
Dude, shop class sucks. Maybe we should have taken home ec.
Yeah. You aren't having any doubts, are you?
If we can go in, and get the GameSphere in 30 minutes, we could still be back at your house playing video games by midnight!
I can't lose another friend. First Kenny and now Stan? All I'm gonna have left are you two douches. 
Dude, my brother's in Milan. There's nothing I can do.
Our band can't find a stylistic direction to go in. We need to go down to the mall to buy hundreds of CDs to listen to so we can define our sound.
Dude, the Civil War reenactment is tomorrow! You're not gonna get it by tomorrow!
So wait, wait: Stan took a dump in the urinal and he contacted the conspiracy Web site? But the conspiracy site was run by the government?
Oh no.  You're not stinking up the entire boat! You're taking a crap off the side into the water!
But I did! Ah, I brought democracy to Cuba!
Why did they search us? That marijawana never even made it to us.
Yeah. I don't remember him saying anything about this.
Aw, come on Dad, don't be such a Jew!
We don't have time for that, dude! We just have to ditch them! Now!
Yeah. Your fat ass isn't on the sled!
Dude! I've been freaked out this whole time because of that guy's movie?
You better! 'Cause if you don't find a cure for HIV, I will break your Xbox!
But... they were here. Ah I swear it. Stacks and stacks of ballots from states all over the country!
Thank you for seeing us, Mr. Johnson. We were hoping that maybe you have some kind of key that can help us with our disease.
Dad, will you just listen to me for a second?
I don't know if that's gonna be too easy. 
We made it! It hasn't gone to commercials yet. 
I can do it. It just got... look, it just doesn't matter, because it's not true.
Okay. since my dad's a lawyer, he says we can use any of his books we want.  Who wants to read them? 
Dude, what are you talkin' about? That was awesome!
You mean everyone has been wanting Britney Spears to kill herself?
Right. But in the 1340s people in England stopped calling it "skite" and started calling it "shit." The same year as the Black Plague.
Whoa, Cartman. We aren't gonna be hippies anymore. Y-you don't have to kill us.
Dude, nobody gives a crap about who your stupid father is! Muhammad is an important issue with actual ethical ramifications!
Dad? Don't you think our last new house is big enough?
They said that Chef works in one of these buildings 
I guess you should leave police work to the professionals, huh, Cartman?
We believe that films have to be taken away from people like Steven Spielberg and George Lucas because they're insane.
Yep! I love basketball. I wanna play for the Denver Nuggets one day.
Don't you think you owe everyone an apology for bringing NAMBLA here?
Dude, I can't believe they fell for it!
Yeah, I just... well I just thought our company name would be more like uh... or-original
It's that ring. Somehow, putting on that ring has turned Kenny into a boring turd.
Well, that's a public school. And in it there are children,  just like us.
Yeahyeah, Mom. I-I can't go to the lake. No, S-stan's having emotional problems and I need to help see him through it. He's got-  wha-what is it?
But dude, there must be something in your past you're not dealing with.
He's smarter than you, fat boy! I don't even know how you made it into fourth grade! I thought--
Doctor, this is Muhammad. We want you to clone him, so we can give his copies to gingers, and Barbra Streisand.
Dad, if the school has to pay you and Cartman $1.3 million, where does that money come from?
Please, I need to talk to the people inside. They can't set off that nuke.
Yeah.  And that means that McGyver is a real person too.
Ike, don't do it! There's still so much to live for!  I know you really wanted McCain to win but, but it's going to be okay.  No, that's not true, Ike. The economy could easily stabilize with Obama's plan.  Ike, don't jump! You could really hurt your ankle or something.  Really Ike, that's like five feet off the ground. Don't do it.
The Jewish population isn't dying out, fatass! It's growing!
You're not filling out nicely, you're fatter than ever!
Dude, I can't believe we are dealing with this Muhammad thing again.
Oh, so you know what mung means, hunh?
We spent all afternoon learning about how we aren't actually happy. I had no idea how unhappy I was until today. They gave me this cool book to read, and I'm already on chapter four....
It's not Helen Hunt's ass. It's an alien space ship.
You're wrong. If my dad says something is real, then it's real!
Yeah. This is like the third day in a row. I wonder what's wrong
I just had a couple more questions about-
Ah, heck, Mr. Visitors, I'm just a kid all alone in this crazy world, but if you could find it in your hearts or whatever you have, to give my brother back to me, it sure would make my life brighter again.
So, what do you want to do now?
There's a Hillary Clinton campaign rally.  Cartman? ...Cartman? 
We just have to show you this new species because you're the Department of Interior guy now. Soon, they'll all be eaten by bears.
We don't know what you're talking about, lardbutt.
We can't wait here any longer! Dude, we've gotta get him out of here or he's gonna die.
"We cordially invite you to attend the platinum album award ceremony, which will be held tomorrow morning at ten. Details and proof of sales enclosed. P.S. Nananana na na. Hahahaha ha ha."  He did it. Cartman got a platinum album.
This is sweet, being rugged outdoorsmen.  Facing the wilderness, not having to be home until 8:30,... 
You mean he's actually stuck in virtual reality?!
All right McNuggets!  Did we pick the right rooster or what?!
How can you say that? Did you see what we did to their house?! It'll take them days to clean that up!
I think if we try Kenny's neighborhood, we might find a- 
I think it went really good. Those people really got into it.
Okay.  N-no, ah I don't want that much responsibility. Here, you hold on to it, Kenny. 
Let's just stay here and watch the whale swim around some more.
Will you stop it with that?! What part of this is funny to you?!
Yeah, huh! You wanna go with us so that later you go, "Haha, I was working for Wall-Mart all along" or something.
I know, but dude, we can't license our games to EA Sports and pay the crack babies nothing. Slavery is illegal.
Yeah, you're cool. And you don't say "hella."
Don't worry. Everything's gonna work out. It always does.
A hundred thousand for a picture of Britney peeing on a ladybug. Imagine what a photo of her crapping on a squirrel is worth!
They're cells that come from fetuses, and some research show that they could be used to treat diseases.
Suddenly, Stan says he knows about some horse stables. Ih it seemed too good to be true.
Dude, we have to get rid of our weapons so at least we can try to deny everything.
Yeah, but you know, I learned something today. We thought we could make money on the Internet. But, while the Internet is new and exciting for creative people, it hasn't matured as a distribution mechanism to the extent that one should trade real and immediate opportunities for income for the promise of future online revenue. It will be a few years before digital distribution of media on the Internet can be monetized to the extent that necessitates content producers to forgo their fair value in more traditional media.
Hey Ike, you wanna come watch TV with me?
Dude. I don't think I wanna be a part of this anymore.
Aren't those the queermos on the Disney Channel?
This isn't a joke, Cartman! You have to believe me, officer. The outcome of the election depends on it.
You guys, I feel kinda bad for that kid.
Yeah. I think maybe everything is gonna be okay now.
We didn't say nothin' about no kids, man!
Then just tell me what Cartman is up to!
How can we be passé? We're only in 4th grade.
I'll meet up with you guys in a little bit. I-I wanna hang out here some more.
It's true. We think that word might be plaguing our friend, Kenny.
I know that I often have serious moral objections to the things that you do, but... this time I think you really need to reconsider, because if you do this, I believe you will go to hell. So I feel it is my responsibility, as your friend, to tell people what you're doing, and to put a stop to it!
They say they can do whatever they want because imaginary things aren't real!
I didn't wanna have to do this.  but if you don't tell us, I'm gonna tell your dad you helped get the wrong person elected President!
Jesus, this sucks! All they keep doin' is dancing around!
Whoa, I don't think anyone's been in here for centuries
She had a contract with us first! We own her!
Dude, this is great! You know all the Stations of the Cross, right, Stan?
All right, all right, I was not responsible for 9/11!  God-damnit!
Why did you go and have to be abducted, Tweek? Now all our parents are freaking out!
Cartman, you're such a fat ass that when you walk down the street people go "God damn it, that's a big fat ass!"
Twenty-two point three years. That's how long it takes for something tragic to become funny.
Yeah. How are we supposed to know that pan flute bands would be outlawed?
Damn. That guy is the coolest guy in the universe!
Oh yeah.  Fine, I'll kick your ass tomorrow, dick! 
When we said "documentary," I thought we meant 60 Minutes, not Honey Boo Boo!
No. They're not a part of your betrayal?
I know, dude! Let's get the hell out of here! 
NO. I can't, Wendy.  All his negativity is starting to make me depressed. I have to let him go.  And whatever happens next, I'm going to embrace with a totally  positive attitude.
Butters, Butters, I'm, I'm kind of super busy right now.
Try it.  We'll see you in a while, we got to go get Cartman's pig.
You bastards! Come back here! Coomme baack!  Damn it, we were so close!
Well, it is kinda true, you know? Thanksgiving is fun and all, but the Native Americans got pretty screwed over.
Uh, yeah! I agree! Uh- my fragile little eight-year-old mind didn't know how to deal with what I was seeing. C-Cartman should be punished!
I'm gonna buy a Walkman with my half.
"David Blaine Workshop. Learn all about David Blaine at the Center for Magic." Dude, we gotta go.
Well, I mean, you didn't just start at 40, didja? You you gotta low-ball these things so you have a place to go.
Yeah well, I can't really afford to play anymore anyway. I'm about out of quarters.
Oh, dude, I feel so much better about being Jewish now that I see that Mel Gibson is just a big wacko douche. 
If it'll make you leave me alone, then just take the damned thing! Here!  There. Now, get out of my house! And I hope you feel really, really good about yourself!
How about we revamp the name? Super School News sounds dry.
Okay, will you let Muhammad come to South Park if we dress him like a pirate?
Cartman, do you remember how we all spent the night at Kenny's a couple of days ago?
Hey. We paid for the sea people too. How come they're not making statues of us? 
...No, dude, that's not the trailer for Terminator 5, that really happened.
Excuse me, this isn't exactly what I had in mind!
Uh, can you take my stupid glasses and put them on the night stand. Make sure they're close by, because that fish upset my stomach and I might need them if I have to go to he bathroom later on.
This copy of Lord of the Rings made the young Butters behave quite awfully.
But they said we can't charge the front door.
Well, maybe we'll get ours soon, too. I'm gonna go and see if I'm bleeding out my ass.
Okay, Ike. You're my little brother, so I have to show you how to celebrate Hanukkah.  This is called a dreidel. You spin it and see where it lands. And you sing this song:
I have a little dreidel; I made it out of clay.
And when it's dry and ready, with dreidel I shall play. Oh,
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay.
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with dreidel I shall play.
You made hamburgers? Well that's awesome! I'd love one.  Mmm. Hm, wow  This is really good, Cartman.
Alright, this is gonna sting for a second. 
Butters, do you really think it's fair to lie like this?! Let me tell you, if you don't have the-
I know, hunh? Put your mouth against the glass like this.  Waaaaah! 
Yeah, and, we don't know whether or not we should care.
Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?! They're identical!
I've tried, Wendy. I've called him, I've been to his house. But since his diagnosis, all he's done is gotten worse.
God damn it this is serious, you guys! Cartman has stolen the election!
That's it.  I'm going to combine my elephant with a pot-bellied pig and make…pot-bellied elephants.  They'd be smart like elephants, but small like pigs.
Do you hear that, Stan? It worked! We've shut down the veal industry!  Stan? Stan?? 
Dude, look at Bebe.  Something seems different about her.
Dude, asshole, you're keeping a lot of other celebrities in purgatory!
Yeah. I've changed mine three times already 'cause it itches so much.
Yeah.  HEY, WHEN ARE WE GONNA GET TO SOME ACTION, HUH?
Uh where should I sit? There's no place to sit down here.
Then I was right. Job has all his children killed, and Michael Bay gets to keep making movies. There isn't a God.
Ugh, okay Stan, what do you wanna do?
Dude! Just 'cause some stupid North Park kid blew his hands off, we don't get to buy M-80s?
Okay. Here we go.  Hey! That was right on target.
See? Look at this. Ike has all his friends over and they're just sitting around on their own computers barely talking to each other. Ike is watching PewDiePie play Dragon Age.
Not because of the Jews, Butters! Who told you that?
There's some terrorists or bankrobbers or something that have taken our class hostage!
Will you get out of my living room, please?!  Hello?!
Well, ah I mean, we have to accept that we have a problem, and put the blame completely on ourselves. I mean, maybe this isn't really even a disease. 
You're not supposed to rock, you're supposed to keep the beat!
That people shouldn't sue each other all the time.
See? You can still make it for the end of the party.
No I won't, because you'd eat 'em first, tubby. 
Should be the next one. 2778 Mala Vista Drive. Wait, this is City Wok.
That's okay, we'd rather just go by ourselves.
I don't wanna know when I'm going to die, fatass! 
These people aren't going to prove anything. To believe any of this you either have to be a liar, or stupid.
Hey, what happens to me in the future?
It's too late. The treatment would have killed it all.
Yeah, but it's okay Butters. They have purity rings now.
No, wait. No, we have to stop them! They're raping him. Rape!
How come you didn't buy any cards, Stan?
It wasn't my idea to burn the Wall-Mart down.
Don't, don't act for me, Stan! Really?! Because every minute I'm watching this video become less about awareness and more about you!
You want Tammy to give you a B.J.?
Yeah, yeah, that's cool. Bring the left titty out some more.  Yeah, yeah freeze there. 
Jesus, I can't do anything.  I'm just a fourth grader going against the entire government.  Uh, hello? Jesus?
Yeah, what do you guys wanna do now?
Yeah. I think Phil Collins rocks the house.
Come on dude, we have to get to practice.
You just hate smoking, so you use all your money and power to force others to think like you. And that's called fascism, you tubby asshole!
They just released part 3 in theaters and it made 80 million opening weekend.
Oh that's,  yeah that's good, that's good. Alright, chapter... one...
But where have you been? Things aren't the same without you. Nobody seems to have the Christmas spirit.
Dude, what kind of sick joke is that? Girls suck ass.
Sir, you recently passed a new law allowing parents who have given their children up for adoption to change their minds. My little brother was-
You weren't playing fair, dude. Getting your dad to work part time at the mall wasn't fair.
So we're not TP'ing a house with kids inside it!
Mom, Dad, what exactly are this party for?
Dude, no wonder terrorists come from places like this! If I grew up here, I'd be pissed off, too!
The past...four nights we've tried to play, he shows up and kills us!
Well there's nothing you can do, so you just have to be patient.
Chef, we need Butters to gain about fifty pounds fast.
Of course it smells like ass, retard. It's a sewer! 
The knights of Standards and Practices were created to make sure that bad words were kept to a minimum. "Curse words" They're called that because they are a curse. We have to go back to only using curse words in rare, extreme circumstances.
Stan! Stan, what the hell is going on?!
Uh, Timmy, if we back to the other kids with that turkey they're gonna be pissed!
But if I stop now, I'll just be going with the group again. So, to be an individual, I have to bomb Pearl Harbor. See ya. 
Hehe. Why the hell did you dress up like Raggedy Andy dude?
Hey! We should buy Ms. Ellen Valentine's Day presents. 
I bet you don't win.
They don't let big fat asses
perform on TV.
Yes. His flowing melodies are really enjoyable to us.
You can't! Poor Ike must be so scared, up there all alone. You gotta help me, dude! 
Yeah. And then Craig's family came on and said Tweek was the wuss, and then punched Tweek's mom in the hooters.
All right. Butters, go get next to her.
Well, how about we just say, "corporates should be stopped"?
Uh. My adopted brother got taken back here to Canada? So, we want to talk to the new Canadian Prime Minister about getting him back?
You don't need that! Get off of it.
What? You mean like you don't like the singing, or the lyrics, or what?
Ogh. Oh cool, she likes basketball? That's perfect! Thanks, you guys!
I think you're awesome, Funnybot. Uh, but you can't go around taking everyone else's jobs.
Yeah, I hate you, but I'm not going to help kill you.
So, dude, do you have any brothers or sisters?
Yeah, check this one out. Ready, Ike? Kick the baby!
I know, but he posted a message of me with a schlong on my head.
...Yeah, and dressing up and running around at night is faggy anyway.
Jesus Christ! They can bat themselves out!  Our whole summer, dude. We have to play this boring game all summer long.
Cartman! What kind of stupid-ass question is that?! Of course it was fun!
Dude, we have to do whatever we can to get that feeding tube put back in!
How come the visitors aren't coming for him.
Eh... hey, Cartman?  You really don't care that you can't go?
If it's on the school network we can track the IP address.  This way. In here.  Whoever it is using the computer in the music room.
Ike, that is enough! If you're interested in Call of Duty, go play it downstairs in the living room!
Are you sure this is where they said to be?
It's okay. Everyone, it's okay. Perhaps one day, you will all understand. What I do, I do because I care about each and every one of you. 
Well, what about those two college guys next door to me? They're always doing science experiments in their basement.
So where are students getting all this cough medicine??  This surveillance footage shows a group of troubled kids getting all the smack they want from a pharmacist!  Sexy Action School News reported the pharmacist to the South Park police, and he was immediately arrested! 
No, I'm serious! I wanna see what's happening downstairs, so let's just do it! 
No it isn't, it hurts! I can't believe they let us play this in school.
I'll die if I do swim in it!
Come on, Tweek! He's only got one arm!
And then Craig was all like, "Tweek is scared o'me. He's a big chicken." And he started doing an impersonation of you being a chicken;  well, everybody in the world saw it!
I'll call the producers of the show. They'll help you find your dad.
They told us that "Phillip. He's the one with talent. Just get him for Earth Day."
Chef, there's a new kid in school, and he's a total weirdo freak.
That's one twenty-fourth of a second of our movie already shot! 
Well? Now what are we going to do?
No way, dude! It sucked ass! They don't even have cable!
Stan, don't you think this has gone far enough? Is it really that big a deal?  Yeah, just vote. For Giant Douche.
Oh, God.  Wuh. Aah. Get out of here!
Here's the thing: Whether or not I'm a part of it, crack baby basketball is popular. Somebody's going to do it. So the only way for me to try and help the situation is to be involved in it, so that I can steer things in a direction that is more beneficial to the actual crack babies.  Oh, it's sooo easy for you, isn't it? I mean, what do you have to do except lay there and think about what you did at school today, or what you want to watch on TV tomorrow? Well sorry, Skippy, but the world isn't always black and white! Just because some people are born poorer than others doesn't mean I can't enjoy a few McDonald's French fries in a hot tub of gravy from Kentucky Fried Chicken!
Pleahehese! My farm hasn't expanded in three days!
There. Did you see? He just flipped you off.
There's no choice anymore, guys. Don't worry about me. I've been preparing for this for a while now. 
Because I-  I... Um... because I think... they are real. It's all real. Think about it. Haven't Luke Skywalker and Santa Claus affected your lives more than most real people in this room? I mean, whether Jesus is real or not, he... he's had a bigger impact on the world than any of us have. And the same could be said of Bugs Bunny and, a-and Superman and Harry Potter. They've changed my life, changed the way I act on the Earth. Doesn't that make them kind of "real." They might be imaginary, but, but they're more important than most of us here. And they're all gonna be around long after we're dead. So in a way, those things are more realer than any of us. 
Wait a minute. There's only four of us.
Are you guys having a meeting or something?
Coach! Coach, I'm all better. I'm ready to play.
Cartman, stop! You don't know what you're doing!
Wait!  I brought him! I brought him to show you! 
Time for you to get proven wrong, fat boy.
Hey, Jesus! Ih-if you win the fight, can you turn Kenny back to normal?
Look, I know it isn't exactly what we wanted, but maybe we can train it.
Yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy.
Mom, Dad, have you ever met Ike's kindergarten teacher? 
Ike, there's been a mistake. You don't understand.
Look, let's just get our money from EA Sports and get out of this whole thing once and for all!
Well, that's not really what you say in the commercial.
What am I going to do? My little brother's been abducted by aliens.  You farted. 
Yes, ah I'm trying to locate my parents. M-my name is Kyle Broflovski. Yes, I know Obama won.
We don't know where Cartman is, Ms. Choksondik!
Wait. The U.S. Government has a portal to the imagination?
Come on, Ike, hurry up!  Where is the next train going?
We'll help you look for him after the game Stan.
Congratulations, sister. You have heard the noble truth and are now a Blaintologist.
Damn it! Come on! I'll try to get more money from my mom. 
Cartman, you need to stop this stupid little game you're playing!
Yeah, we made the whole thing up. It was all just a really, really funny joke! 
Do any of you guys have milk money I can borrow?
Yes. It's because the Pharaoh won't give the Hebrews what we want! God is angry.
Well, who really cares what that monster is outside? As long as we stay on the bus, it can't hurt us. Right? 
You're garbage! You know that?! You're cabbage!  You've got cabbage in your muff!  You've got cabbage in your fuckin' muff! 
Oh my God! Our GameSphere! You've gotta move me closer! 
Well yeah, but not if your decision is for Turd Sandwich! What the hell is wrong with you?!
You didn't think of anything, Butters! Guys have been doing what you're doing for years! You're nothin' but a common pimp! 
Cartman, you only come to soccer practice on Fridays, and that's only because we have Kentucky Fried Chicken afterwards!
How come the visitors aren't coming for him?
Yes, I believe that you believe you helped write that joke. That's how people like you work! Your ego is so out of whack that it will do whatever it can to protect itself. And people with a messed up ego can do these mental gymnastics to convince themselves they're awesome, when really, they're just douchebags! 
That is the dumbest idea you guys have ever come up with! I'd expect this stupidity out of Cartman, but you, Stan?! Butters needs medical attention right now!
Don't worry, Mr. Hankey. We'll go tell everyone. Come on, guys. 
You'd better!  Dad, can't we talk to this new Canadian Prime Minister? Iif he knew the situation, he might e-
And then we won't have to show anybody the picture Kenny has of you guys sucking each other's jagons.
Yes, people can get hurt. That's how terrorism works. But if you give into that, Doug, you're allowing terrorism to work. Do the right thing here.
You can't believe it?? He does this shit all the time!
We-ull, some fish would be great if it isn't too much trouble.
Excuse me, is this really what you think she should be doing right now?
Can we please just try and talk to him?
Well, I fell down this ice cavern,  and I saw this block of ice, so I told my friend to throw a rope- 
Dude, have you really listened to the sixth track? I think it's my new favorite.
Please, sir. I came because I don't think Ike belongs here. Family isn't about whose blood you have in you, family is about the people who cared about you and took care of you. We're not the same blood, but I love my little brother. We've taken care of him because he needed us to, and that makes us more family than anything. 
That if he could prove leprechauns exist, I would suck his balls.
I wrote down... all the lyrics to the Happy Days theme song.
Aw I don't think he wants to play, dude.
I was the one. I was too afraid to say anything, but I can't let Kenny be sock-bathed for it.
I'm going to see the Queer Eye For the Straight Guy people.
And you don't see a problem with that?
'N Sync, Backstreet Boys, New Kids on the Block. All had five members.
Alright guys, do you think he's lying or telling the truth?
Hey, wait a minute. How come Ike's tombstone has the Canadian flag on it?
I don't know what the hell to do. The whole world's gone crazy.
Yeah. He doesn't even know that the South loses the Civil War.
Hey! Hey, let me out of here! This is a mistake! I agreed by accident!
Well, he screwed us by makin' something up; I say we do the same thing.
Ah, I told you we shouldn't have brought him to school dude.
You guys!  You gotta help me. These business casual G-men are trying to kidnap me!
They're just drunk, Cartman! As soon as they sober up, they'll stop.
Stan, I have to go home!! I need my cream!! I need my creeheam!!
It always has been. See? This is nice. 
What would we use a marble sack for?
Yeah. They've kinda killed Kenny -'s look-alike. You bastards!
No. You know what? Screw this! We aren't ugly!
I'll kill you, Triceratops! You made fun of my crippled mother!
Well, everyone in the world thinks you are. See ya. 
Dude! I'm glad to see you. You would not believe the night I had.
Dude, I can't deal with Wall-Mart right now. My parents had me there for three hours last night. 
Yeah, that's why we wanna have a startup company.
Well, we've all talked it through and we've come up with a theory.
A family! So THAT's why you haven't been able to spread Christmas cheer.
Hey dude, people are kind of pissed off at you.
Okay, there. Now we can carry this egg around in this case without it getting cracked.
Oh. Good idea, Phillip. Let's look for treasuh.
Okay, fine, Butters. But if you're gonna hang out with us, you have to play like Lord of the Rings. 
Aw, I just hit my nose playing dodgeball.
This is not a woman! It is a succubus!
Well that goes without saying, fatass, how could she help but look at you!
What the hell is going on?  Hello?  Excuse me, I need to get to Los Angeles.  Hello?! 
You've had that cough a while, Kenny. You okay?
Wow! I had already forgotten how great third grade was.
Cartman? Your side won, dude. Why are you so sad?
Revamp how? The rules are that the fourth grade class has to perform the Helen Keller Story.
Cartman, we can't do this alone. You have to get up.
Hm, I wasn't really going for "gay," I was more going for "wholesome."
Why are they doing us one at a time?
People of all colors and creeds holding hands beneath a rainbow!
Dude, what the hell is going on?! Why did they replace Phillip?
Yeah. I guess their rules did have a point. Things have gotten a lot worse in the ten days since they've been gone.
Aw man, here we go again! Use the Jew as a scapegoat.
Sure!
I have a little dreidel; I made it out of clay.
And when it's dry and ready, with dreidel I shall- everybody!
Sorry Ms. Cartman, but your son took some things that didn't belong to him.
Me?? Dude, I've been here since the beginning!
Dude, screw this! I don't wanna see anymore!
Dude, did you see that stuff Phil Collins was saying about Timmy?
You want a fight? Well, that's fine with me!
Dude, just ask Chef for help. He always knows what to do.
Fine,  then we'll shut our cable off altogether!
I guess there's nothing we can do. Chef likes her more than us.
I don't wanna go to your stupid movie premiere!  And don't tape that to my locker!  Oh God. 
Yeah... but doesn't it seem like we got out of the White House pretty easily? I mean, it seems like it would be pretty hard to escape from the White House with everyone chasing you, and we just kind of... ran out. 
We only have one option. I've gotta take you to the surface.
Ike, I don't know what to do. All the guys are getting their periods, and I don't think I am. I can't be the last one to get it. I just can't!
Look, this is all getting way too big! Tell the movie studio you aren't selling the video to them.
You're just jealous he's a better psychic than you.
We're not letting you back in the band, Cartman! Fuck off!
Alright, so did everyone settle on their wrestling names?
Some kids think I'm strange 'cause I like studying for an exam
But I don't let that bother me, because it's who I am. 
We need help! Our friend is in a coma!
Oh no. Nohoho no. Cartman, don;t you do this! The Middle East is finally at peace!
We got six days to make it to Los Angeles. If we keep our stops to a minimum, we should be able to get the episode pulled just in time.
Yeah. You used to sit in the living room with family and friends to hear their commentary on things. Now you can get it with a l-
You aren't gonna get away with this you stupid asshole! 
I am sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Keller, but I'm afraid your daughter Helen still cannot see, hear, or speak.
Patrick Duffy? Damn it Cartman, that's not scary!
Ike, you'll always be my little brother, okay?
Is, is this? Do you think this is cool?
You're not gonna die, Kenny. Don't be stupid.
Ike, you can't possibly want this. We have to tell Mom.
No. We can't, dude. We have to win the Terrance and Phillip dolls.
Now, wait a minute! Everyone just stop for one minute!  Look, you guys are gonna end up killing her. Can't you see that Britney isn't in any condition to handle this crap anymore? I know watching celebrities go down can be fun. Me and my friends are just as guilty as all of you, but maybe, we'll just, maybe, ...it's time to let this one go. Just this one time, let's, let's all stop before it's too late, huh?
Singing a Christmas song isn't gonna get you nice deductions, Cartman! Don't forget: it's because of you that Santa's sleigh got shot down!
No, Cartman, we can't do it on Raymond again! It has to be on a current event in South Park. Tweek, do you have any ideas?
Let's do this together, dude.  Our only shot at playing any next-gen console is by teaming up. If you wanna game on a PS4, then I do too.
We've got to get rid of them.  Nobody should have the kind of power Barbra Streisand wanted! 
You wanna kill me?! Fine!  I can't live like this anymore! Go ahead! Do it! 
Well just hurry, Butters. You can probably make it back in time before the first commercial break.
You mean that you aliens actually enjoy sitting around and watching us fight and kill each other? Dude, that's messed up.
Yeah, but you know? I think we all learned an important lesson about laughing at other people's misfortunes.
Guantanamo Bay?! We can't go to Guantanamo Bay!
You can't just roll into places and take people's lives away!
Stan, people in Beaverton are still trapped on their roofs. Nobody's helping them because they think they can't go outside.
How much do we have left, Cartman?  How much do we have left, Cartman?!
Well, I guess let's just be thankful we're not Butters. They won't even let him come back to school.
Be a good boy? You know all about this?
We can't get out! The flames are too big!
Yeah? Well Butters is ten! He doesn't exactly know what's best for him and neither do you!
Cartman, are you still trying to become a lesbian?!
They're TV dinners. Don't you wanna take that veil off so you can eat?
Dude, look, we, we just saw all this stuff on History Channel.
But dude, check out my new Trapper Keeper.  It has five different compartments for each subject in school,  and it's all covered with pictures from Dawson's Creek.
(I can't take it! I want out right now!)
I'm gonna make a new costume during recess. I can still win that candy.
My Dad says he can't live here anymore.
But that is what happened! It is! Tell them, Cartman!
You're having dinenr with his family? What kind of family has a kid like that?
Yeah, but you're our new friend and that makes you cul.. p-piable!
Hey!  How about you come to school with me tomorrow, so I can at least prove I'm not crazy to my friends.
You know God-damn well what! Now get outta here!
Aw man, I don't think it's very safe to be on this bus.
If you knew something, but, you couldn't tell anyone, what... what would you do?
Okay okay... I love having Cartman's farts in my tummy. I love it.  I love it sooo sooo much.
Wait. Isn't there some rule about not getting into cars with strnagers?
Mr. Hankey!  Where the hell did you go?
Come on, Cartman! How much do you wanna bet the South doesn't win?!
Dude, we don't have time for your stupid jokes! We're gonna die!
Cool! We'll see what we can find, ma'am.
Give me the drum, and you play the flute.
Don't you "Oh, brother" me! She's the woman of my dreams!
Oh shut up Cartman! You don't even know what you're talking about!
Yeah. Let's just have a slumber party here.
Don't worry, you guys. He forgot about Kenny. Kenny will help us.
Stan, I don't like Wendy.  All I cared about was getting an A in this stupid project!
That's nothing compared to what my mom will do to me if she finds out I've been lying for five years!
We're here dude. Just a little further and we can finally end this.
No dude, I'm out. Go talk to her yourself. Be poetic. 
No, it's great! It's just what this country needs right now!
You saw it in The Thing and you're wasting everyone's time!
Whoa! What's wrong with your head?! Why are you shaking like that?
Cartman, you are hereby declared a full-fledged retard!
What's this about you going on live television on Saturday?!
We'd better be. We've been in line for almost an hour!
Jimmy, exactly what part of the fishsticks joke did Cartman write?
God-damnit dude, your mom and dad want you to come home!
Hey, uh, does anyone know who that guy is?!
Well, she's not here! That's just great! Thanks a lot, Stan! You're gonna get me busted again!
Sir, we would love to sign your wife.
No, the nipples are more in the middle, see? 
It's just a marketing ploy by the network. Like that time they had the first male-to-male kiss with Terrance and Phillip?
It's a really dry cold; that's the problem. It- the cold air makes me wheeze.
Okay. Okay, the shot is finally set up. Now shoot the O mouth for two frames. 
A U-Haul. What if we bring Muhammad to South Park in the back of a U-Haul, and he just stays in there out of sight?
Dude, what do you mean "We don't have a coach."?
I don't want you to jump them, retard!
And do I have to shovel the whole driveway, or just the side the car is on?
Butters! When did you call Oculus Rift Customer Service?!
Yes. My name is Kyle Broflovski. Can you tell me if I purchased an Oculus Rift headset there?
Come on, dude, somebody needs to wipe that fuckin' smirk off his face!
That's it!  You're not getting high again until we have our Okama GameSphere back!
Yeah dude, we made you your own Facebook page. 
Heeey Ike! Look what I got.  The new Call Of Duty! Do you wanna go downstairs and play?
All right, here we go.  Since the days of Copernicus, man has dreamed of flight. On this historic day we remem- aw, screw it! 
He was very brave. He risked his life so that Mephesto could live.
No dude, we can't go around showing our weapons to people. Our parents'll find out we have them.
'Cause, dombass, scary monsters don't eat big fat smelly bitches!
Do you think they're gonna pissed at us for lying that they molested us and sending them all to jail for ten days?
Cartman! We've been brainwashed, don't you see? We don't have to do this!
Cartman farted in there! We had to breath it in for 20 hours!
Don't hurt anybody, sir. We could try and fix this.
Aw, hey dude. What are you doing here?
How can they let an eight-year-old decide Kenny's fate?
I'm going to try and break you away from the computer, Cartman. I need to remove the CPU.
Guys! You guys!  Listen: Cartman has tens of thousands of voter ballots hidden somewhere. He's changed the outcome of the election!
Alright Cartman, I've been doin' a lot of thinking about how the company's gonna spend the money we make off the EA Sports deal. We're going to use thirty percent of the money to build an orphanage for the crack babies.
Ex, excuse me?  My name is... Brad. And uh I need to report a crime. Anonymously.
Hey you guys! Check out my sweet Chinpokomon doll!
Oh, man. I can't just sit here, I have to help my stupid brother, or I'll come home without him and my dad will start yelling, "Where's your brother, Kyle?" "You weren't looking out for your little brother, Kyle?"
I TIVO every episode. We can go to my house and see what they did.
I'm going to the kitchen! This is stupid!
Um... so...  So dual citizenship, wow, uh... You know that I, I never knew anyone that had that.
An online chat party for all his friends... Dude, I should get over there!
You guys! You guys! I have awesome news!
Is that why there's crap on my doorstep every morning?
Yeah, but if they're wrong, no big deal. If we're wrong, we burn in hell.
Maybe their baby will be still-born, like Cartman was. 
This is how they talk to us!  You'd better watch your mouth, kid!
We can't let those sixth graders get their hands on this videotape.
Yes. There's a Russian guy named Vladimir Stolfsky who's got search engine hits all over this thing.
We didn't realize hunger made you feel so bad.
I'll never forget you. You were my best friend after Stan.
Anyway, that will give me plenty of time playing video games.
Dude, Mr. Hankey has magic powers. He can do whatever he wants. 
Sir, we are really worried about our friend Clyde. Everywhere he goes people are telling him he had blood on his wiener.
No, dude, you don't wanna bring your people to Mexico, there's missionaries there, too.
You gotta come to Kenny's house with us.
Dude. Are you sure that fish is a murderer? It seemed like a normal fish to me.
Stan, you can't keep doing this to yourself. You have to go live.
Why don't you take it to one of those pawn places? Every two blocks you see a guy with a sign that says "Cash For Gold and Jewelry." There must be a lot of people doin' it.
But, everyone thinks I was responsible for 9/11.
Dude, that's not cool. You shouldn't make fun of Christopher Reeve.
No, no, no! Don't become an angry mob!  The last time we did that we killed Jesus!
I wanted to get Ike out of his room, so I invited all his friends over for a slumber party to play Dragon Age: Inquisition.
We can't deal with you saying "hella" anymore, Cartman! You're going to the other universe! 
In our deal with EA Sports we are giving them the right to use images of the crack babies and their names. But we aren't paying the crack babies.
And we think that that is  a savage hypocrisy, because all crimes are hate crimes. If a man beats another man because that man was sleeping with his wife, is that not a hate crime?
We went through all that just for some gay video of Earth?
How, how long do we have to take the shuttle?
Then why did you send us the goat?
Mayor! We have the solution to your problem.
Come on Stan, don't you even know where you would go?
Dude, we have to get to the mall!!
Sir? Sir, can we talk to you for just a second?
Comments on commentators, it's all changing so fast.Playing XBox with your brother is... just a thing of the past.
Now with Ma on her iPad, and Dad trending or trying,All the family is scattered, and the living room's dying.
Because it wasn't the outdoors or church or even trips to go ski,
What brought families together most was a good old TV
Now we watch things by ourselves and just tweet what we saw.
And if you try to complain, you get called a-
Aww. Well Cartman, you can change things about yourself.
Dude, if these guys are as bad as you say, then we have to do something!
Both you guys, stop! Please. You're gonna make people hate us more!
Just, you know, make some money off him. Like Honey Boo boo.
Well? Are you happy, Cartman? Butters is completely traumatized!
I looked on the known species webpage. There's no animal called a 'Jewpacabra' mentioned anywhere.
She did, but now they're saying we have to start going back to school anyways. It's totally gay.
Man, I can't believe how much people want us to get our winning ticket back.
Aw, they wanna fight! They just don't know it yet! 
Ike, I'm sorry, but I couldn't get us out of school Friday. I can't take you to Yo Gabba Gabba Live.
Here! Here! Look at this. It says "The succubus enchants its victim with an eerie melody. This is the Succubi power. Only playing this melody backwards can vanquish the succubus power."
Look, however hard you think it for you, it's a lot harder for him!
I told you Cartman, I'm not one of them! I don't wanna live in West Jersey any more than you do!
All this for a bunch of stupid movies?
What do you mean, "there's no tooth fairy?"
What uh, what are you supposed to be?
Aah I think you'd rather hear this in private!
I think out band better buy a whole bunch of music CDs to listen to for inspiration.
Get up, fat boy! I'm gonna kick your ass!
This is ridiculous! Are we really going to go out there and play North Park like this?!
I can't just hide my whole life, Butters. And besides, I have this strange feeling that one of you is gonna totally betray me. 
Just admit you were lying, Cartman, so that everyone can go home!
Okay, that's enough.  Everybody! Cartman is just pulling one of his stupid tricks on everyone, because he's trying to get out of a deal he made!
Well, you have to help him, just like I have to help my dad.
You know, you used to sit in the living room with your friends and family, and THEY were the ones commenting on whatever was on TV.
When Cartman first opened the door, and saw the Thompsons, he felt bad for playing a joke on them. Now that everything's turned out alright, he's able to laugh.
I don't know. We just have to get it to town and let them figure out what to do with it.
Wikileaks.  It says here his name is Wikileaks.
Yeah! Next time you make up a word, don't make up one that already exists!
Ike, please. I know your first love seems like the only love, but trust me, it's not. You have so much life ahead of you. 
You get a platinum album for selling one million copies, you fat turd!
No way! You wanna go with us so you can betray us at some point and keep us from destroying the Wall-Mart.
Dude, you need to snap out of this! So Wendy left you for Token. What are you gonna do? Just be miserable your whole life?
Hang on.  Hold on a second.  I gues... I... guess... this is... goodbye, Willzy-x.  I'm gonna miss you.  Hey, don't forget me, okay? I won't forget you. 
Guys, I think we should bail out of this right now!
All right, now everybody take a tablet and a pencil.  and when all the ideas start coming, just write 'em down. We might not remember everything otherwise.
Gone are the dark clouds that had me-
Hey! Maybe you can come with me. Then it won't suck so hard.
Wait, wai- I can't let this happen.  Butters.
Oh my God... their pitcher was able to hit him right on the bat.
I just have a feeling this might be the last time we get to do this.
K... what if we cover his face with a paper bag?
Yeah, sweet! Maybe we can get a reward for the frozen guy!
Only sixteen dollars? They can't be cool if they're only sixteen dollars. 
I know it's hard to believe, but you have to trust me.
I can't do that, I'd just feel too bad.
We're gonna teach that fat bastard a lesson!
Dude, if 4 million people play the brown noise at the same time-
I see... a man... with a baseball cap.  He's killing now... Oh! I'm seeing it all flash before my eyes! The guy's name is Michael Deets, and he lives at 621 Castillo Street. He's usually there between seven and eleven p.m.
Wow. I think I owe you one, Cartman.
That was the dumbest ride I've ever seen!
Well dude, how the hell are we supposed to play it, then?
Then why the hell do they call it "veal"??
Cartman, you don't buy pubes, you grow them yourself!
...Alright, that does it!  This has been bothering the hell out of me!  I knew it! You're not Cartman at all!
Well, Tweek's okay, but he's certainly no Kenny! 
But I feel like a basketball player. That's all I wanna do. 
I told you not to call my mom a bitch, Cartman!
Cartman, you hike me the ball, then somebody run, and I'll throw it at something. Ready?!
Well, because, we don't really... believe in Jesus.
Go on and go home, you fat chicken!
You spent $10 and eight hours to unlock a stadium?
This is it, Stan!  It's just like I designed it. There's the miniature gold course over there! And slides and uh,  excuse me, what is this place?
You're watching someone play Call Of Duty and talk about it?
Stan, there was never anything between Wendy and I.  I wouldn't go out with my best friend's ex-girlfriend.
I knew it! It wasn't because I gave that guy twenty dollars! The homeless all came from here!
Look! It might be a coincidence, but I think we'd better ask someone. Come on! 
You... bastards!  Wha, what the hell is wrong with you?? What kind of Prime Minister bases his decisions on hatred?  And, and takes away mounties' horses?  And French people's wine? What the hell kind of Prime Minister are you, anyway?!
Wait. That's it. Atonement. Of course.  I know what I have to do now. Thank you, Father. 
What should we do, dude? That big snake keeps growing; it's gonna demolish the whole state soon!
Shut up Terrance, we can geneti-cal engineer anything we want.
I don't have a choice, dude. I'm gonna swallow my pride, face Cartman, and say "Congratulations. You were right" And I'm gonna give him the ten dollars. And hopefully, he won't make a big deal out of it.
Yeah, he wanted adventure! Not a bunch of ridiculous bullcrap! Right Chef?  Chef?
Dude, my mom and dad keep fighting all the time. And both of them say it's because my dad doesn't have a nurection. So I want to get him one.  Damn it! What the hell is wrong with everybody? 
Ah, look, Phillip. Everyone in South Park just wants to see your serious side.
Listen, you don't have to do this! Our imaginations aren't running wild anymore.
Dude, you can't miss Halloween! You have your iPad?
Well, yeah, but what if the grampa wants to die, cause he's really old, and he's just asking for help?
I need you to keep quiet about this, all right?  My little brother and his tea-
No, Ike! You can't come to school with me. 
But Chef always helps us with our problems. When we have a problem, Chef sings to us and makes it better.
It's perfect! I could take her to a basketball game.  Man I I don't know what's happenin', but... it seems like all the girls are... kind of into me lately. 
The South loses this battle, Cartman. They lose the war!
I just didn't think it would come so soon.
Aw, come on, dude! All you've done for the last four days is mope around! You might as well hang out with those Goth kids who dress in black and talk about pain all the time!
So, you guys are totally broken up then? It's... done?
Well, you guys can do what you want! I'm going down to that church to confess my sins and eat crackers! And I'm taking Ike with me! 
Excuse me, what are you doing to my locker?!
Hey yeah! What's that song she always sings? There's got to be a morning after.
We need to get our friend to a hospital right away!
Anyways, I need you guys to help me so that my parents don't realize Ike is gone.  Knock it off, asshole!
This is where we all stand in a circle and pray to Moses for guidance during Jewbilee.
Dude, this book says there could be infinite alternate realities to every reality.
You know what? At least Scott Malkinson has some self-respect! At least Scott Malkinson doesn't cave into peer pressure and start doing musicals!
Oh wait. Wait, I'm supposed to play here.  Hey, Mick, w-would you mind if I stepped out for a sec?
Look Butters, why don't you just talk to your family about it? You said your Grandma's visiting this week. Why don't you try talking to her?
Uuuh. Well, the truth is, we didn't write that paper last time. 
Ike is starting his first day of kindergarten.
I'm not arguing about The Passion! He's being an asshole!
I mean, yeyou people are all just such hick jock rednecks; it's just like you right out of a stereotyped catalog.  Ah I can't take it. See ya. 
Dude, he's not gonna swing! So just throw balls. That way he'll have to walk to first base. 
Awwgh! Hey dude, we don't even have enough weight to move.
-bring me back my little brother, God damnit!
...And if you look here, you can see how David Blaine performed the miracle of being frozen in ice at Times Square.
And you don't see any parallel between that and anything else in history?
We didn't think that by pretending you didn't exist, you would really change, but you really have.
And did you see her lazy eye? You can't even tell what she's looking at.
I don't want to ask Mr. Hat, I'm asking you!
We really think this is gonna work, Stan. All we have to do is convince your dad that his cooking sucks, right?
This place is rad. Look at all the trees and stuff.
Did you guys ever see that one Brady Bunch where the guy... 
Wow, there's a lot of profiles here. Kyle Broflovski's amazed Stan has so many Facebook friends. Hey, Kyle Broflovski's amazed Isiah is also a Facebook friend of Stan's.
Because then you can pay us to use our friend in commercials.
I don't know. Last night we found him hiding in the kitchen pantry. He was screaming the name "Billy Mays" over and over again.
Hey, is your show as good as America Idol?
Dude, you killed your own dad, and you're worried about that?!
Hoh no, dude. If they get sent back to Romania, we'll never get our Cirque dei Ceville going.
I'm not going to help you freeze yourself, Cartman! It's a stupid idea!
You're telling me that every time you guys download an update for iTunes, you read the entire terms and conditions?
Uhn, you don't understand! My friend is in Imaginationland! I can hear him in my head!
Abraham Lincoln has been dead for two hundred years!
We're right here dude. Do you remember now?
...And in conclusion, the Latino community has provided America, and indeed, the entire world with innovations that we would be lost without. And that is my presentation on the role of Hispanics in American technology. Thank you. 
Yeah, fatass, this is their famous Mechanic sketch.
Okay. N-no, ah I don't want that much responsibility-bility. Here, you hold on to it, Kenny. 
Sssss-so ...Bebe ...didn't become smart and cool? It was just her boobs?
No, we'll stay here too. If we start wandering off, we're gonna get lost or killed. Let's just wait here and hope help comes soon.
Look, can you guys just get down to business so we can go find my little brother?
Go on, Canadian! Beat it! I'm through getting in trouble for you!
Well Token was a definite winner for talent show. But then we decided to take everyone to a baseball game, to see how we got along there.
Yes, yes! Now the Jews shall take control of Christmas once and for all! HAHA! HAAA!!
Well, why did you pull it out of the trash?
We d-didn't think it was that big a deal.
Why would they play such a cruel joke on us?
Dude, you have to tell everyone. Right now.
Can't we just play with that big parachute again or something?
...But what if I do a bunch of chores around the house? Come on, you're being unfair!
You threw it away, Cartman! It's mine now.
Yeah. But there was so much of it. I was up until two in the morning.
You're gonna give up on Faith Hilling just like that, Butters? How could you?
Hello. I'm Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States.
I can't. My dad grounded me. Wait a minute, where is my dad?
It happens to be called poutine in Montreal! 
Llook, I know I'm not the best-looking guy in town, but I I didn't think I was the very ugliest.
Ahh, hi, can we speak to the head guy or something?
He's not a douche! He talked to my grandma!
Hey, come back! We didn't even get to do our play. 
"Wanted by U.S. Border Patrol"?! "Permission to shoot on sight"?!
Well, I've gotta go start our animation. We've only got two days. 
Rebecca, in public school,  we select our... own mate.  In public school, men and women get together. Make each other happy.
Yes! I can't help but take some credit for this. I helped convince him to go!
Wow, you know, Cartman? That is an awesome idea. You should totally go to Somalia.
Because I m-I mean I really think you could have done it for about $12.50.
That's not how a croc sounds, you fatass penis!
You were right. You were right all along. I thought you were just an asshole when you ripped on Jews, but... I didn't know, I... I didn't know.
Yeah, I don't know what to do with it, though. Well, see ya.
He worked so hard, come so close. Now we'll never see Kenny crawl up into Ms. Crabtree's uterus.
Listen, doucher! Our parents are gonna kill us, and you, if they found out that we bought these!
Dude, I don't wanna see a bunch of guys' penises!
Are you gonna take us somewhere or not?!
And so they put us in these harnesses and helmets. I th-I think that's when we started realizing, "Oh wow, this is actually pretty dangerous."
No it isn't. Come on, I have an idea.
Mr. Garrison, since haiku sucks so much ass, could we go to the planetarium again?
Eh-heh. L-look, if you want an explanation, you you'd better go to Kenny's house.
Why? Why, Mom? Because if I do something bad will happen to me? Because if I do your God might not shower me with his blessings of infected hemorrhoids?
Heidi Turner said you asked her to borrow superglue last week.
It says you gotta check it for holes or tears.
Yes, Mr. Garrison, I have to go now.
Okay, so how do we get my little brother back?
Oh, so the gallant knight now comes to rescue me from the bowels of mediocrity! Oh, thank you, your royal lordship! 
I don't know, but at least from now on, every time we look at the moon, we can know that Willzy-x is up there, dancing with the other zypods in his castle.
That's it Cartman, I'm outta here!  Chatroulette is no way for me to find new friends! 
Wait a minute, the rights to Star Wars, the movies? What the hell is going on here?!
I found the number for a really cheap airline to Canada. If we go as soon as possible, then-
All right. Thanks for your help, dudes.  Well, we did it, guys. It wasn't easy, but... we did a really amazing thing.
I think we should bail. If we leave the group, maybe other people will get the courage to leave, too.
Oh, jeez, we're gonna have to buy tons of these things.
Dude, there's a guy with a gun here!
Yeah. He was doing their voices and pouring tea for them.
Towelie, over the past few months I have watched you go from an ancillary character with a few amusing catchphrases to a dried out spooge rag covered in the jizz of a thousand older men.
Okay, now put one end of the tube a half an inch into the incision. 
NO, why the hell would you keep eating something that made you crap blood?!
There can't be that many pet stores in South Park, dude. 
Maybe it's better you don't know who your father is, Cartman.
Cartman, how stupid are you?! Didn't you read the Bible? We have to leave you up there until you die, and then you come back to life in three days.
Hold tight, buddy. We're gonna find a cure for you. 
Uh I'm trying, Mr. Mackey, I really am.
He probably thinks if he apologizes to everyone, we'll think he's changed and let him back into our circle.
Dude, I think it might be best for us to never piss Cartman off again.
We're, we're in trouble. We're in sooo much trouble.
So, do you uh, do you have any brothers or sisters, Natalie?
Why the hell don't people tell me these things?!
I guess I didn't realize it was just about the points. 
All right, fine, Cartman! You really want me to go in there, I'll...  Dude, Cartman, what is that behind you?
No! Chef, they've filled your head with lies! Can't you see that??
Yeeah, you're welcome. I'm sorry I doubted you. And guys, I'm I'm sorry I acted like a know-it-all. 
What happened? Aren't you still wallowing in pain?
Don't listen to him! You still have a chance to preserve your film! 
They've just gone crazy for a while. Please, mister, I have to hide my brother until they come to their senses.
How the hell did they find out it was us that TP'ed that house?
That doesn't make me feel better! I wouldn't even be able to keep it down.
You won the bet. You were totally accurate about being able to crap out your mouth, and I've just been frustrated because I didn't think of it first. I want you to enjoy that money because... you really impressed me with your insight and... I'm... proud to have you as a friend.
Well, c-cause dude, I'm Jewish, a-and you know...
Because- because that's not even entertainment! I mean, it's just, just, rehashing shit, isn't it?? It's like everything these kids are into these days, you know, it's just... rehashed shit!
I'm sorry you guys, but there is something we can do. We can go to Canada and see the Prime Minister like I said. If we can change his mind before Christmas, then your parents won't have to give my family money.
Agh! Look, dude, we're on level 24, about to cross into the Caverns of Madness!
They picked up my hash tag, Stan! I'm trending!
Alright alright Kenny, calm down. You're too young to be getting BJs anyway. It's good you and Tammy are making a commitment to each other that isn't based on sex.
It's okay. You don't have to feel alone anymore. 
Dude, hold on! This is bullcrap! If they wanna live in our time, then they should learn our language!
We won't let it happen again, Mr. Mackey, m'kay? 
Disposing of the doll wouldn't be easy. He would have had to have brought a shovel to decapitate it.
But that sucks. I don't want something to have that much power over me.
I told you Tom Brokaw doesn't have a mustache, fatass!
Kenny was never gonna get his singing right anyway.
You did, dude! You drank his whole body!
Why would he put anything in your butts?
When a man and a woman feel ...love... they put their lips together.
But we found a frozen ice man from the past! 
The outside of the device seems to be covered in numerals. Inside are colors... which must open up to some sort of temporal time warp.
They were wearing cowboy hats!  Did you see??  Did you see?? 
Butters, we are sick! Don't you get it?! We're gonna end up just like Kenny!
Mr. Garrison, didn't the guy who shot John Lennon say it was because of this book?
I know. It's like we have the outdoors back again.
Jimmy, we're gonna have everyone write in a mascot that's really funny, and you have to tell us which one would be funnier.
I don't know what we're going to do? It's been like four hours and people still won't talk to us.
It would've been faster if Cartman hadn't slashed the tires!
The reason Chef has been saying those terrible things about us is because he's been brainwashed! By this- fruity little club!
Dude, I don't think we should be messing around with that crap anymore.
Ju-just have a little compassion, huh? I mean, everyone's gone out and bought something stupid. It's not so bad. Whichever of you guys has never bought anything frivolous, go ahead and huck the next squirrel. 
Cartman was visited by aliens again last night. And now it's like we're living a repeat of a previous day.
We don't wanna be in a group with Tweek.
E-excuse me, w-we aren't going back now? Aren't we done?
Yeah. And the leader, he said that all the Ethiopians can go live there. 
Officer Barbrady, I wanna declare Shenanigans on this carnival operator.
I'm sorry, can I come back in just a little bit?
All right. Come on you guys, we have to get back home. 
Do you really think your civilization is better than ours?! You people play games by killing animals, and oppress women!
Dude, when he gets out of Juvenile Hall, he's gonna wanna kill us!
Shut up about Jews, fatass! You don't know anything!
He just stacked his Shapeshifter with an Elven Blade!
I don't know how you do it, dude. How do you get up in front of that many people?
Bye-bye seeme mama.  Ah, I'm gonna take him up to the bathroom to get washed up. 
Don't you think it's a little strange that Cartman keeps asking you to stay over?
Boy, that really did the trick, Stan. I thought we were kind of, sort of, not really done for.
Can I just get some Goddamned tater tots?
What? Y-you want me to hang out with you?
Hey, so... do you wanna be Facebook friends?
You can't talk to Stan, Wendy. He throws up when you do.
Well, we tried, dude. If anyone else in this craphole hates Americans, we'd better just leave the goat and get back to the plane!
There he is! Now, don't let him know we think he's a loser, or else he won't play. 
Dad.  Dad, Ike and I have been talking, and well, we feel that your new car is changing you.
Because we do. It was like this yesterday, and the day before that.
Ah! Ow! Hey, it hurts!  Owie-ow! Help! Ow, that hurts!
Ookie mouth!  Gross! I can't do it, Ma!
Ike! Do your impersonation of David Caruso's career!
I'm telling you, it's okay. Maybe you should ask the Lord for guidance.
Ugh! We're gonna end up watching this whole retared Russell Crowe show!
A big success?! You can't even get Tyler Perry to go back home!
Just take me home! I don't wanna be here anymore! Take me home!
Wow, look at all these people playing right now.
No! All we have to do is not shop at Wall-Mart anymore! If you want it to go away, all it takes is a little self-control and personal responsibility.
Stan, you can't let that Tad guy get to you. Screw him, dude.
I don't really see the fun in...  ...not trying to kick that game's ass once and for all!
We're making the news more appealing to students.
Excuse me, but Ike has homework he's supposed to be doing.
Yeah. And then we can try the football field. 
And then takes you to Chipotle, and buys you more?
Because I saw you. Okay? In your room, passed out, with a VR headset on. Customer Service said that one of us needed to put on the headset and come get you, and that's why I'm here.
Everyone is watching everything.  Ike?  Ike, if you can hear me, I'm sorry. I have been a grandpa.  I didn't understand the things you are into and I and I thought you should like the same stuff that I did.  I have to accept that you're gonna have your own things. I just didn't want you to watch HIM. I just... I just wanna be a family again.
They did it to us again! That dirty talent agency stole our client again!
Yeah, real life is so boring and stupid.
That thing is pretty cool. What games did you get with it?
I don't know, dude. It's like everyone's putting pieces together that aren't there.
Cartman, there's something I need to tell you.
Oh. We'll wait for you over there, Steve. We have to start fighting now.
Whoa whoa wait a minute!  This isn't what I signed up for! I like Family Guy. Why do we have to get it off the air forever?
Well, what's the point? Jimmy always wins with his stand-up comedy.
Yeah, this guy.  Vladimir Stolfsky. He had videos on YouTube of every single rally.
I know. Something big is going on. Take a look at this. I did a Google search for "Hillary Clinton Campaign Rally" right? And one of the links was to YouTube, where this Russian guy had a bunch of videos.
They're gonna take The Lord of the Rings from us.
Hey you guys! You guys are not gonna believe this!
Date-rape something. Yeah. Okay. I will. Okay, thanks, Mon.  I don't have to go outside!
Chef, the police are asking questions about you!
The sea people from Cartman's side are suicide-bombing the buildings on Tweek's side.
All right, look, there's gotta be other Third-World countries with space programs. We've gotta split up and find someplace cheaper, that's all.
Tango, this is Foxtrot. Are you in position?
So you intended for us to go ziplining all along? Why, Stan?!
Baahir Hakeem.  Born in Chicago, eight years old, his favorite color is green... Car, Cartman, what is this all about?
Can you believe it, Stan? I never thought global warming could happen so fast. I guess... I didn't listen.
When Kickstarter went down, many saw their startup projects die, but here at Washington Redskins, we saw opportunity. People still need a way to raise money for their stupid startup projects, and with the Redskins you can now go fund yourself.  And the idea is simple. You, the people, go out and raise all your own money, and give the Washington Redskins 5%.
Yeah. Boy, am I glad to see you, Ike.
HAHAHAA! Now I shall rule the --  Aww. Uuugh. God it burns! AAAH! My soul is on fire! Whoa! Oh, I don't like this!  I didn't know it would feel so... dark and evil!
Dude, L. Ron Hubbard was a science-fiction writer. He lived on a boat with only young boys and got busted by the feds numerous times.
We thought you were meeting us at Cartman's. What are you doing here, Taylor Swifting?
Dude! I almost thought those Afghani kids talked you into not liking America.
Dude, this book says I don't exist unless I think I do. But what if I don't?
Dah.  Does that mean you'll go to the dance?
So, do you agree to fight him after school?
I am sooo sick of that stupid bitch! Blabbin' pussy little skank! Why do people talk on their phone like that?! I can't even get a minute of piece before that bitch walks in, holding the cell phone out like this , and talking on speaker phone! Nobody wants to hear your goddamned conversations, you little bitch! You're not that important!
Aawwww! Hey Dad. Is it true that you and Kenny's dad used to be best friends when you were young?
God, that was not cool at all, dude!
I'm sorry. I'm. I'm really. Cartman, I f-I feel really bad for you. Honestly.
There's a lot of holes in the Theory of Evolution too; it doesn't mean it's wrong.
Nono wait. I I know how you can reverse it, Cartman.
No, Mom-uh, he, he doesn't want you kissing him. 
Aww gee, that's... so sad. Everyone should have one Facebook friend.
Get out of my way or I'll kick your ass!
We told you they were real Cartman. Sorry to hear about your ass.
Okay, I fed the pigs. Now I definitely should water some fields... Oh wow, cool. That Jewish kid put up a sign on my farm. "Hey Kyle, really like your farm." Oh awesome!  What the hell is that? Stan? 
Don't you just feel a little bad for Clyde?
But you're lying to people. If they knew that you didn't eat just all the sandwiches you want, you might not be so popular.
Dude, you've been sitting at your locker crying since lunch break. Clearly, something's going on.
You guys! You guys! I've looked up the word, "shit"! I think it might have something to do with people dying!
But that doesn't mean it has to go off the air. You should like that show. Your sense of humor is just like Family Guy.
Yeah, and he was out sick yesterday too. Guys...  I think Kenny isn't here because he's at home cheesing.
Well, there you go, fatass! I hope you learned your lesson.
They'd better be done with the book reports! School starts in 15 minutes!
All right. Mr. Garrison, have you ever had a friend who got a new girlfriend, and then stopped being your friend, and it pissed you off?
Cartman, uh, all I was trying to tell you at Wall-Mart was that you-
I am Tooth Decay. Your teeth shall be mine. With candy and treats I will take-
Come on, dude! I can do it! I'm sure!
Come on, you guys! We better get to work! 
Well what the hell are we gonna do? Dress him up in a princess gown and, and parade him around like the parents on those awful child pageants? 
Yeah!  I was just hanging out in my room, and then I perioded all over the place.
We're trying to raise money for our school chef.
Come on! Everything's gonna be okay!  Sir! Sir!
Hey, that might work. But it can't be a party for us.
That's what you care about?! Who's the poorest kid in school now?!
Hang in there, Ike. We're gonna get you help.
Get ready guys. Whoever is in here is the kid that's hacking our e-mails and phone calls! You guys ready?!
You found Cartman like this and you think he's somehow trapped in virtual reality?
Nothing. Um , my period is really uuuh...  Uuuh, my period is going swimmingly.
Look, we're from Colorado! We, we grew up in the United States.
Oh, thank you! I was so eagerly awaiting your approval of my abilities! 
Oh well, I I grew up in the shity, ah ah I really don't care for it. Ah I come from a Jewish family, which of course you already know, because Kyle's from the same family.  I like to read, and I have these polyps on the backs of my hands - I don't know what they are.
Bebe, I thought we were going to watch Terrance & Phillip today.
Dad, can we go home? All you ever do since you got this car is drive around and show it off! 
We're just gonna fly to California and break into George Lucas's house. What's stressful about that?
What the hell do you think you're doing spreading this crap to kids?!
Like look at him. He's always shaking and nervous.
Here, give me that.  "I am Bumbly Wumbly. I live in the pond."
Ot- Nice to meet you, Cartman. Yuh you know, I saw that same jacket you're wearing at Bosco's for $29.95. How much was yours? Um, I juh- I was just wondering if Bosco's is a ripoff?
To City Wok so we can make our money. God!
No, I'm serious. What is that behind you?
Just tell us where Lemmiwinks is being held prisoner so we can kill this stupid rat!
Maybe we should get out first. See if we can find a way out and then come back for him.
Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo
he loves me and I love y-
Oh my God! What the hell are we gonna do for six hours?
Oh wait. Hey AWESOM-O,  I'd also like some celery sticks chopped up two inches long, with peanut butter and raisins on top.
This isn't paradise and you know it! The people here are starving and dying! The whole world has used Somalia as a dumping ground for toxic waste. Even the fish here are radioactive!  Cartman, just give me my brother  and let us get out of here!
Heh, don't, don't tell him what it is, dude.
If we're playing outside he shows up completely wasted and, and screaming how the government is following 'im.
We can't. We're saving our money for the balls in Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth game.
Don't get scared up in the mountains Cartman.
Dude, I just got an IM from Stan that they evacuated the school.
I didn't do anything to you. Timmy saw the turkey and wanted to get it. What do you want me to say to him?
Uh, nice costume, dude. Who are you supposed to be? Luke Perry?
They never grow old because they die before they're 30!
Now look, Butters, when the girls bring out the future-telling device, pay attention to how it works. Once you know how to operate it, just grab it and get the hell out of there.
But you accepted money from the Canadian government! To push a freemium game on us! Why would they do that?!
You know what's goin' on. It's Smackdown tonight. Which means we might have to fight each other.
Don't be sad, Ike. Just be happy that you live in a country where people get to elect a president at all.  Hello?
Oh God! Look, I know you got Asperger's from the school and I I'm sorry. But your negativity is poison to me!
I need $17 so we can win Terrance and Phillip dolls.
What's this comforter filled with? Um, it isn't filled with down, is it?
Now, don't go saying that. There's always hope. Miracles happen most every day.
To people like you, and me.
But don't expect a miracle.
Unless you help make it to be.
You hope, and I'll hurry.
You pray, and I'll plan
We'll do what's necessary, 'cause
Even a miracle needs a hand!
Yeah, dude. I told you, we had bread sandwiches for breakfast.
You know what you assholes like! You like to fuck! And shit! And fuck! And fuck! And fuck! And fuck!
Did you guys hear that?! A hundred thousand dollars for a picture of Britney.
If someone says they saw a Sasquatch, they are either lying or they are stupid. Now stop lying about a Jewpacabra before stupid people start believing you!
Oh no! No, Ike! You are not watching him comment on things!
What are we gonna do, Stan? It's, it's not like we can change the way an entire country thinks. I don't like it, but it's just the way they are.
We can't tell our parents, dude! We lied to everybody! Nobody knows we're responsible for Ms. Claridge's accident!
Dude, this whole building is going to collapse!
Mom, Dad, you've always taught me that being direct and honest is a basic Jewish tenet.
But Dad, this is all the never-before-seen footage.
Dammit Cartman! I gave it to you so you would shut... up.
Well, YOU don't, because you're a non-caring asshole, Cartman!
We don't have a choice, dude. That guy killed our characters 14 times.
What's the matter, Mr. Hankey? Are you sick?
See? I told you, dude. Those are dialysis machines.  Old people have to hook themselves into it with a tube, and it sucks all their body fluids out.
No, you're fat to begin with, chubby! Now you're Texan too!
Nancy Kerrigan got the silver, dude. She came in second.
No you didn't, asshole! What you did was totally stupid and racist! And you only did it to screw me over!
He did not say that! You just want him dead so you can have his stupid PSP!
Yeah, they want everyone to stick around and watch more of this retarded show.
They're goin' to show the new Terrance & Phillip trailer
Ungh, I can't find the word "queef" anywhere! 
You made us pull you to safety because you ate treasure?! You son of a bitch!
The judging's almost done. You're gonna make it.  Oh God.  SOMEBODY GET ME A CHARGER!  Hold on Stan! Don't die on us!
I'm making a dummy Ike doll. My parents think he's out with me right now, and I have to bring him back for dinner.
I'm sure that would scare the hell out of him, Cartman.
In there? But it's very confined. I'll get cramps in my legs.
We need to see the new Prime Minister.
Cartman, I thought all you wanted was a Haibo doll!
Uh, I must have the wrong number. We were trying to reach City Airlines.
Well, I- I invested in that IT thing, and there was a bailout, so I received a five million dollar bailout clause check, which, which I can use to help my family, so, I- I guess, goodbye, cousin. 
Which one of us took it?! It was so long ago, I c- I can't remember.
Because, dumbass, we can dare them to do gross stuff and make them cry! What? Were you born yesterday?
Dude! Nobody wants to hear you commenting on things!
Hey, are you going to come to Ike's bris this weekend?
Ike, I didn't tell on you, you got busted by the hallway monitor.  Okay, okay. I did have something to do with it. But someday you're gonna realize it was for the best.
Mr. Hat, may I please be excused from class?
Judas Priest.  Wow! Downloading music for free is awesome! 
Come on, dude. We've gotta get out of here. I don't know what they're planning next, but it can't be good! 
I'm sorry, Kip, but I really can't be your friend anymore. It was a great ride, but I must say goodbye. This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do, but ending a friendship... is never easy. 
Oho, we will. Trust us. We won't miss this. 
Did you smoke some of your mom's crack?
Hey, that's it. Oh, my God, that's totally it!  It's so simple!
Oh. Ah, we're trying to reach Oculus Customer Service.
No, no, w-we we really did write it. Tell them, Butters.
Dude, boars are only worth two experience points apiece. Do you know how many we would have to kill to get up 30 levels?
But if the tape must be brought to the House of Butters, who else can do it?
Dude! Dude okay! Stop! I'm sorry!  Says that you are currently... hosting an online chat party for all your friends.
No, it's still just some whiny, annoying teenager talking about how lame he is.
Mom, there's sssomething I need to tttell you.
We can't give him over to the gingers!
Uh, we need to go to Canada. As soon as possible.
Well uh, he'll have to do. Cartman has to get some practice with a real bull.
All right, then we go with the plan. Just like "To Catch A Predator".  The first guy is here. This is probably HotForBoys219. 
We understand you just sounded like a freakin' racist!
How much do you think Mr. Mackey needs?
God-dammit! Come on, we can go watch it at my house!
Hey dudes.  Sorry I couldn't make it yesterday. What'd you guys do?
I know. It's probably gonna be the biggest night of our lives!
How? How could the Jews do that to Jesus?
You wanna bet?  Let's go ask my Dad right now!
Sally Struthers, dude. She used to be on Full House.
Just wait till everyone sees my sweet Chewbacca costume. They're gonna be so jealous... 
Dude, don't kill your mom. That's not cool.
Yeah, we're the Goonies, Cartman. Why don't you pretend like you're the fat kid?
I happen to be the one person who's putting everyone else's needs before their own!
So, how are things going at Cartman's theme park?!
Dude, will you just end this thing now?! My little brother is gonna die!
Uch, I didn't think there would actually be a leprechaun! And I still don't! Why would a leprechaun be warning us of a terrorist attack?! There's another explanation for all this.
Dude! How are we gonna move twenty three calves to your house?
Look, just go ahead and play, alright?  Leave me alone.  Can I get a Fresca, please?
It's true.  He doesn't care what faith you are.
Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo
he loves me and I love you
Therefore, vicariously he loves you
Even if-
Hey. Wuh I'm giving a speech tomorrow about people with red hair and freckles. Can I ask you a few questions?
Hey! What the hell are you doing inside my little brother?!
So get off your fucking scooters and pick them up!
Yeah, maybe starting a detective club isn't such a bright idea.
Come on, Ike! I promise I'll be nice to you from now on!
The Queen and King of Stan'ses house wish The Lord of the Rings returned to them.
Hey Blanket. Uh, look, we're goin' over to help my dad chop wood. You... wanna come with?
What do you mean? We're learning all kinds of cool stuff.
Cartman, let me out of this stupid net!!
Now she's doomed to walk the earth in limbo. 
Cartman got his, then Kenny. What if tomorrow Stan says he got his and I'm left out? I might not even get to be their friend anymore.
Come on. Let's go see how Cartman is doing with his uh, urection.
Uh... W-uh... but... Come o- come on! Really? I mean, aren't there more important things going on right now?
The Diamond of Pantheos.  She must be powerless now.
Yeah. Stan said they're having them over for dinner tonight.
It's been a week since Ike's been gone, and every day my parents seem worse. I have to try to go to Canada and speak with the new Canadian Prime Minister, but I can't do it alone.
I dream about it every night. Every time I close my eyes I see us just running away, running while they ray-rape him over and over again.  And because we did nothing... they got away.
Look, we already have the guy's blog. Maybe we can find an address and check it out on MapQuest.
They're saying something about taking over the entire country.
Wait!  I may not have Santa, but I do have Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo.
Mom, Dad, can I go with the guys to see the Raging Pussies?
If you don't show Mohammad, then you've made a distinction what is okay to poke fun at, and what isn't. Either it's all okay, or none of it is.
Trent Boyett will do it. He's the toughest, baddest kid in preschool! 
No, we don't want to enter any of your stupid shelter!
Okay, okay, you can have your powers back.
Well, Ike. You can tell Cartman that it's my triangle!
How many ways are there to take it?! It's just a stupid word!
...and now I have to go home without him and my parents are going to have me killed.
What the hell have you gotten me into?!
Oh no! It's that  super-sad Sarah McLachlan commercial! Look away!
We did it! You see, Cartman? You won us the Terrance and Phillip dolls!
Oh. Hey, that's not very nice, Mayor. Just because a person is gay doesn't mean he's a fag.
Hey! Don't try to pass it back on me, fatass!
Oh God!  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to-ah, I'm looking for my brother.  Ike??  What the hell is going on??
Now, that's what I call a sticky situation. 
Don't let him touch you! You die if he touches you!
Look dude, it's just one movie. We wanna have a good time.
Why do you always have to hit stuff with a stick?!
(I need some help! I can't take it!)
I don't want to! I don't want anybody telling me how to feel anymore!
I don't get it, Kenny: why do you buy razors and shaving cream?
You got Randy Newman to do the theme song. You're not trying that hard. Token, you're a good kid. How can you sit there and collect money on a show that's about a, about a fat child killing himself?? Where's your sense of shame??
Cartman, you dumbass! You can't get a new one!
Come on, Ike, we can make it just in time for dinner. 
All right, where are the missing ballots?!  President Obama?
I-Ike, this is a big deal. You have to be absolutely, 100%-
Dude! He got Brent Musberger for a leg!
Because now he's acting like gingers are awesome. And all his friends are gingers. When he wakes up tomorrow and realizes he isn't really ginger, it'll be hysterical!
I'm sorry, Stan. I'm sorry. This whole war has just got us all so screwed up. I just want us to be playing Call of Duty on the right machine.
We still have an hour before the costume contest, so let's hit the house on the uh-
Yeah. And you know, now that I think about it, third grade wasn't all that great, either.
Yeah. It's almost as big as Cartman's ass.
When an artist creates, whatever they create belongs to society
That's horrible. If that's true, I don't wanna see it.
You see? And then I can take all my homework on my iPad, and swipe it over to my iPhone.
Why do they have to put this on TV?! 
Well look, if being around lots of cash negatively affects the HIV, then maybe...
Why? How could you do this? There are people starving in Alabama and... and you give Cartman a million dollars?
No! Didn't you guys learn anything? Look, if we make an album, all that's gonna happen is that people are gonna steal our songs for free off the Internet. We won't make a dime!
Stop it! Stop!  Oh God! Oh God, help us!
We're all gonna pitch in on an entry!I can't believe they would put a fake Mr. Hankey in a mall! If Mr. Hankey ever found out, he'd be so pissed!
I dunno. I just have this sudden urge to go back.
Yeah, Jimmy's right. I know we can come up with way better ideas than Craig.
No, we really want nothing more to do with these people.
Stop wasting the tacos on your hand, Cartman!
City kids get to go to museums for field trips. We get cow farms.
Please? I need you to come sit down for a second.  So... Here we all are. Mom, do you want to tell Dad something?  Mom?
If some of us are on PS4s, but the rest of us are on XBox's, then we all can't play together online. See? This is all about committing to one machine.
Hold on, this fight could last more than twelve hours. What if we run out of food?
I can't wait to get out of school and get our Teiko sports watch.
I didn't see he wouldn't be there, either. Look, all we have to do is get them there, right? Once Terrance and Phillip get together again, it'll be like old times.
You better watch what you say Cartman! You might be poor and hungry some day.
You mean, throw the game? You know how our parents are about this sport.
Calm down Butters! The men are taking action. But we need to take your picture.
Come on guys! We gotta go tell Chef he's in love with a succubus.
Mine neither. But I double-checked, and Cartman was right. Your period is the start of puberty.
I don't know. I think... we've been given another chance.
I can't believe I let you scare me into taking your side. You used fear to make me stop believing in free speech.
Twenty-five cents? Well that's not even worth it.
Dude, you don't understand, I'm a Jew. I have a few hang ups about killing Jesus.
We're not gonna hurt her, we just need some of her blood.
Cartman, don't you remember the last time you had this dream?
Come on, Stan. Hospitals aren't all that bad.
Cartman, you go ahead and do the commercial tomorrow. But I'm warning you, those anti-smoking people are liars and they're bullies who will stop at nothing to get what they want, and that means they're dangerous. 
Couple of days?  But Terrance is going to have his human clone by tomorrow.
I think the other dog's the one that's confused.
How do you know? You weren't even there.
If only we had realized how special our time with his gigantic ass was.
Wow. That's a lot of sea men you've got there, Cartman.
Stan, I told you. My mom doesn't want Ike playing hockey. She thinks it's dangerous.
Butters! We said you can't watch it! We have a quest!
You can't kill all three of us, Cartman!
City Wok brought him down to a size 4.
I knew Kenny couldn't fit in that tea pot! 
Mr. Garrison won't let us out of school. He thinks we're making it up.
STAN, WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE! 
Four tickets to The Lion King on stage!
It isn't fair. I spent weeks preparing my speech on Latino culture.
Goddamnit, don't you get it?! I hate pee! I'm grossed out by pee! The only thing I find more disgusting than pee is bananas!
What has this world come to? Where people can just... take your Okama GameSphere.
Yeah. We're guys, dude. We find something about all our friends to rip on. We made fun of you for being rich just like we make fun of Butters for being wimpy.
You think you own the entertainment business, but you don't! Give us back Wing, RIGHT NOW! 
We made it, Ike. You're going to be okay. 
Haven't you noticed everyone getting sick? It all started when they said "shit" on television.
We're totally screwed!  They took the two best judges away!
You guys, we can't give up on our dreams now! As soon as this strike ends, we're gonna be the biggest band ever!
Tweek. Now there's an interesting choice. Tweek has a lot of qualities that I look for in a friend.
Come on. I'll tell you all about what happened to me. 
Well, I just figured you'd vote for my guy! Who's fuckin' friend are you?!  Puffy!
And that applies to all of us, doesn't it? Even though it's convenient to have things done for you, sometimes it's best to deal with it yourself. 
He's gotta show up. He's just got to.
Yeah. We'll be the "Save Films From Their Own Directors" club
Charlie's right! I'm not gonna let some fake Mr. Hankey spoil my holidays.
Dad, there is so a tooth fairy, huh?
You guys don't understand! His wacko teacher is like a schoolgirl! They pass notes to each other in the classroom, they have sex at her house over lunch break,  and during class they sneak out and kiss in the hallways! 
Well, I- guess we'll see you in school tomorrow, Chef.
Please, you guys, you don't understand.  My family is devastated. My mom just walks around the house like a zombie, and my dad can't stop crying.
I am picking up carbon-based life forms in Sector C. I believe we will find a village of peaceful aliens over that ridge. 
It's a long trip, dude. You're gonna need help. We can try and get the episode pulled together.
But my parents are gonna cut off his ding-dong!
Jambu! Jambu, I'm back!  How are you feeling?  Huhm. Jambu, you wanna talk about rocket ships?  Ja- Jambu? Are you still feelin' lonely here?
Well what the hell are you doing?! This isn't gonna work now!
Man, I guess sometimes we let our technology and stuff grow too fast.
You guys can't tell anybody, all right? Not until I figure out what to do.
Wow uh, you think it takes forty dollars to get people to like me.
Dreidel dreidel dreidel,
I made you out of clay,
Dreidel dreidel dreidel--
Oh no, dental floss, what will I do?
Come on Eric, we can go play at the bus stop.
Ugh. Can't you see this is my dream?? Music is my life!
Officer Barbrady, I would like to reinstate my previous Shenanigans! This whole carnival is a rip-off!
I've been thinking, Wendy. This whole outcome is pretty strange.
Dude, why'd you make that deal? If we're out buying tampons, we'll miss the trailer anyway/
Come on, everybody. I think Kenny wants to be left alone. 
Of course, the sewer! That must be where he is. Come on!  Come on!
I don't think my mom would want me doin' this.
This is serious. They've been going out for almost two weeks now.
Just get the hell out of here, Cartman! You're not serious and you're a detriment to the band!
You've always been a dick to me, Cartman, and I'm not inviting you. 
Ike!  Stop the bus! Miss Crabtree, you have to stop this bus!
Nah, dude. Are you on America's side, Stan? 
Then that's it. I'm... I'm never going to get my brother back. 
Yeah. And I think I figured out why.
Why?! So that we can lose our business and everything can go back to old times?!
What did they do with all the fat? There must have been enough to last an Eskimo family months.
Dude, what the hell has gotten into Cartman??
Why are they all out driving at the same time?
But everyone tries that. There has to be something you're exposed to that others aren't. Could we see where you sleep?
It doesn't matter. Because God is going to harden the Pharaoh's heart!
Well like we said, we didn't know whether or not we should care?
You guys, maybe we should come clean right now and tell everyone that it wasn't the tobacco companies that made us want to smoke.
Tattle-tale?! Do you know how serious this is?!
Hey. You're right, Wendy. Come on, Stan, we have to go get Cartman. 
I hear your parents might give up selling meth for good.
Kenny, what's funnier? A giant douche or a turd sandwich?
I still say this is a bad idea.
We... didn't realize what we were doing, eh...
Let's just get this over with, Cartman. You won the bet, here's ten dollars.
No, we gotta go. Sally Struthers is gonna give us a ride back to Earth.
What about Dan Rather? Do you think he's real?
Dude! Every time we play Americans vs. Bosnians, you cheat!
You can raise $2 million, dude. We'll help you.
Butters! He got a ninja star stuck in his eye, and we were taking him to the vet when you fucked it all up! Butters!
You have to! Here, have some more mayonnaise. 
I'm the whole solar system! The planets even all revolve the right way. That tub of candy is as good as mine!
Do with us what you will, Mr. Lucas!  But please, don't change Raiders of the Lost Ark.
Dude! Where have you been? I've been waiting all afternoon.
Well, it looks like she's not going to show up, Stan. Let's go look for the visitors now.
Dude! We're not digging up my grandma; I'll get in trouble.
Towelie is cool, but he gets stoned all the time. You can't really rely on him for anything.
No, Cartman. You said nobody will have to be grounded. We're not playing dirty!
Look, we could we could probably get Terrance, but he'll be performing with this other guy.
Mister... Jackson, y-you aren't alive. You're in purgatory.
Dude, I'm not going to lose to Cartman's stupid turd sandwich. 
Well, I... kind of gave a homeless guy twenty dollars last night.
I'm... glad... that you guys can just keep living. I don't think I can. 
What do you mean, "can't"?! You made it work; just build us another one!
But that's all that matter now! It's just all ... and the new celebrity?
I have to watch out for my glasses. Ow! Ow, it's so cold! Oh Jesus! 
Stan, you don't get how cool Facebook has become. You can message your friends, play Yahtzee with your friends, even start your own virtual farm and have your friends visit it.
What? Y-you gotta vote, dude. Haven't you seen the Rock the Vote stuff or, or Puff Daddy's Vote or Die?!
All that time and effort we spent helping Token and this is the thanks we get?!
Mr. Garrison, seriously, I have to go. Can I please be excused from class?
I don't know. I feel like I should confront my mom first. But it's so embarrassing.
I have to join Jewleeard and make Grandma proud!  Tell my parents I'll call them. 
I am taking it personally because Cartman is a retard! Just because he hit his head and went into a coma doesn't mean he's a- Wait, that's it. If I want people to listen to me, I just have to be as stupid as Cartman.
We’ll get my dad to be Chef’s lawyer!
You don't pee in the shower, dude, that's fucking disgusting!
Dude, they don't care we knocked Butters' eye out with weapons?
Do you think we did a good thing, Stan?  I mean, no one even seemed to notice.
How stupid do you think we are?! Now you die on that cross and get resurrurected before I kick your ass!
Elder, It's not my fault. He told me he was Jewish.
Something must have happened to Chef while he was gone. Maybe he hit his head or, or got stuck in some quantum time vortex.
Well Cartman, the South lost! That mean you're our slave for a month!
Yeah, it's tough. But it's times like these that... you see what your band is made of. We've gotta fight through the rough times like Journey!
Well, that didn't work. What else can we try?
Dude, we've been working this case since two-thirty!
All you ever do is talk about your balls!
That's it, Stan! I'm not sitting through a whole movie with you! 
No! These don't belong to you! They belong to the people!
Stan, this is it. Time to stop feeling sorry for yourself and come home! Everyone cares about you and everyone wants you back!
Yeah, but dude, he seriously could have died in that fire.
Yeah! All you have to do is fart some more, Cartman, and the visitors are sure to come!
Dude! Our parents sent us over there to get us sick!
Y-yeah, but… the color of someone's skin doesn't matter.
Sorry, dude, but this fruity little club isn't taking our friend!
Hoh!  Anyways, you put a spin on it by holding it here and-
You've got to stop, Dad. If the South wins, me and Stan have to be Cartman's slaves!
Well, I had to see it to believe it!
Well, maybe we can sneak in over there. Come on.  Sshh. 
Yeah. No more getting pushed around by fourth graders! 
Damn! I thought fourth grade was gonna be different.
But how are we gonna get the balls put on Butters' chin?
You, you paid your friends tuh...  not make fun of me?
We don't know. They lost all contact with him.
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with dreidel I will play
Second verse, same as the first
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidelll-I ma...
Yeah. Come on, Dad, this place sucks. I wanna go.
I endure what I must for the sake of all humanity.
Okay. Today's word is "spirituality." What that means to me is uh- 
That was totally gross. She smelled like vitamins and pee.
Ike, we could go play the game downstairs. Isn't that better than watching some guy on YouTube playing it?
Man, it's really starting to snow.  I hope they don't close the roads.
Eric, sources are speculating that third-grade student, Pete Thelman , pees sitting down like a girl. We've also got confirmation that Sally Turner  stuffs her bra. And Clyde Donovan has only one testicle.
...French fries... pizza... french fries...  come on, Cartman.
Hell no! I'm not being part of a four-member boy band! We'll look stupid!
Mr. Jefferson just seems like he wants to be a kid, not have one.
Maybe we need to make students think they have to watch our news show or they'll die.
Just take a shot or pass the ball, asshole! It's getting late!
Uhhh-woo wow! Isn't this great? You guys seeing each other again?
We're gonna save our parents before they all kill each other!
But, but we, we learned things, and took up a cause.
Well, guys, I guess we're going to Canada.
I don't care! You'd better remember where your base is!
We could go to the city pool. They have a water slide
We can eat it at Cartman's house, and see more naughty pictures of his mom.
I have to show you something.  I think it will change the way you feel about your impact here.
No. This Saturday, for my birthday, my Mom says she's takin' me to Casa Bonita, in Denver, and I get to invite three friends!.
Not if somebody took pictures without her knowing.
Hey, it looks like one of those Etheropians.
Not now, Cartman! I have really serious problems!
God damn it! I don't want him to jump over more a-
I've even unplugged it and plugged it back in.
No. We just have to show him that there's other girls out there. I say we take him to Raisins.
Yeah. Clearly Annie Nelson is the hottest girl at our school. Look at those eyes!
He must have a huge bone in his ass, then. 
Yeah, and then Chef pulled up in his car. 
Admit you're lying, and I'll let you go.
Towelie is a tough choice because,  even though I can see how always having a towel around can come in handy, he's just always so high.
Chef, have you ever had something happen to you, but nobody believed you?
Hey! Maybe we should ask the girls what they learned in sex ed.
So then don't have a slumber party if you're gonna be an asshole all night!
Dr. Biber said he can give me a negroplasty so I can finally look the way I've always wanted. He even took my picture and then did computer imaging to show what I would look like after the surgery. 
Well, I finally got my family to use the living room for an hour each night.
No, dude, if something happens to him, my parents are gonna blame me.
We have to go see Mr. Hankey at the mall, Cartman.
I've been trying! But I just don't know how to make totally new friends on the Internet.
Uh, sir, d'I have a lot of homework to do tonight and I was-
Well, not really, except that Kenny keeps eating people's brains.
Whoa, dude. The road is really snowy out there.
No Ike! They're playing the trailer to the new Terrance & Phillip movie during the show, and we have to watch it! 
In there! Let's go!  Get this jamb on the door! 
Please, just, just leave it alone, Stan. Everything is as it has to be.
No no, it's n-it's not like it sounds. Here, check it out.  See look, we just video the babies fighting over a ball full of crack. It's really getting popular!  I mean it, it's cool because like the commercial said, the crack babies had nothing before.  It, it's great, because everyone wins, you know? You see that? Two million hits.  Did you know they're putting bacon inside of pancakes at Denny's?
Well I've been thinking: maybe there's something you've come into contact with that hinders HIV from growing. Do you mind if we just look around?
Yeah, this life is short. The afterlife is forever.
Dude, you don't have to be ashamed or anything.
Nono Dad, please. I just got Call Of Duty: Advanced Warfare. Me and Ike are going to play it together.
Nono, after we found Cartman, I put the headset on and then-
People aren't gonna support our company if we dig in our heels and say we don't care about anything!
But how are we gonna get to the North Pole?
Come on guys! He's hidden them somewhere and we have to find them!
What?  You mean the missile defense program?!  Butters, where's Cartman supposed to hand over the ballots?!
Well that does it! If us boys are going to live, we have to get rid of the girls!
Another devastating loss for the Cows last night, Eric. They were ahead in the game until Kelly Anderson started crying because she missed her daddy, who's on a business trip in Thailand. Uh, Kelly was so upset she couldn't play, and the Cows had to forfeit.
Hi, we'd like to speak to a  Professor Teabag? 
Wait a minute. Ha-how the hell did these two guys end up here?
No. I cross-referenced his YouTube profile with MySpace, and according to his blog, he's an old-school Communist. So what's he doing at every Clinton rally?
Stan, if I didn't know you better, I would almost think you're doing this because you wanna play with girls.
Man, I would have loved to seen to seen the look on Trent Boyett's face when all the sixth graders showed up!
Not when  if I say he's sick and put him to bed right away.  No, go away! Bad dog!
Why?! So I could be sitting in the hospital waiting to die, like Stan?!
No it's not cool!  My mom won't let me keep him in the house.  She says he's too big, and that his poop is bigger than our couch.
We have in our possession something of great power.  It is... The Lord of the Rings.
Check it out: Now we're going into the secret underground base.
It's too late for that. Things just can't go back, Stan, uh.  Ah-I'm with Cartman Burger now.
No, I just can't get it to load.
Did Cartman just say "shitballs" to the principal?
Wouldn't it be better to just agree with him and forget the whole thing?
We'll just tell your parents we're going on a camping trip with my parents. They'll never know.
Hi, uh- our friend has been brainwashed by some fruity little club.
They said we have to give them money that we make on the Internet.
Please Dad, I've been looking forward to this all week. Aaand it's me and Ike's bonding time. Really. This is good for our relationship.
Now, that's what I call a sticky situation. 
Don't you get it?! You can't have any Trapper Keepers, fat ass!
Please, Ma. I don't think Kenny has anywhere else to be tonight.
If we take him to the hospital, they're gonna find out what happened.
I'm not being in any  faggy boy band!
But how can the Jews make it better??
Wow, I wish we had a stupidest home video. 
But now let me tweet this for you all to comment upon.
The more connected we get, the more alone we become.If you want change like I do, and feel the same gloom,Then please follow THIS trend, #savethelivingroom
Wait. I don't know if this is cool.
Stan! You've got to help us become good Christians. Please.
Oh, hey Stan. Where's your best buddy, Gary?
Throw the ball, you stupid frog!  God-damn, maybe if you didn't eat all those croissants,  you'd be able to-- Ow! 
They got us a truck, and an airplane, and Mr. Worf! The calves are gonna be okay!
Oh my God, they killed Kenny! YOU BASTARDS!
No! I finally do understand! There is no justice! There is no God! Do you hear me?! I renounce my faith!!
We want to talk to who's in charge.
Oh, dude, I don't know how I can take it.
You are not going to go on national television and spew a bunch of hate speech about Jewish people! I won't let you do it, Cartman!
City of Brentwood
They take really good care
of all their homeless
I'm sorry Token, I had to tell him. His life is in danger.
Dude, did your dad know that the show was being broadcast live?
Kenny, how many of my dad's mints are you gonna eat? Jesus!
I left my wife today. Walked out of the apartment without saying a word. I ran away from my responsibilities... just like I always do.  And I, again, am alone. 
How do we find somebody who can wrestle that well?
I appreciate what you're trying to do, Mick, but I ain't a charity case yet.
I'm never speaking to either of you ever again! 
Ah- I was just sledding, and the next thing I knew my sled rope got tangled with a bus, uh. I gut dragged for over a hundred miles before the bus finally stopped for gas.  I'm sorry about your sled, Kyle.
Do you really think anything's gonna be any different now?!  Do you really think that this will have the tiniest, smallest effect on the world?  It's still the same old world out there. Look.  What the hell?
The red- Oh come on, you can't possibly be here for that!
Look, Stan, we're really getting concerned about this cult that you're getting into.
It just ran by here a second ago. 
Didn't you hear? They outlawed fireworks 'cause a little boy blew off his hands.
You see, we've learned something today. Swearing can be fun, but doing it all the time causes a lot of problems.
I'm supposed to go to the lake with my family tomorrow and swim and play in the stupid sun.
Okay, it says here the operation begins with a one-inch incision in the ab-do-men on the left side just above the hip.
It's funny that something that should be completely private is put up on a Web site for everyone to see??
Dude, I guess we've just got to try it without him.
Red Robin can be rented out, for wedding parties. If we all chip in we can pay for the deposit to have the wedding party there.
Please, you guys. This is for Earth Day.  You care about Mother Earth, don't you?
Where is Butters? We were supposed to leave here forty minutes ago.
Man. Cartman's more screwed up than I thought.
We... came to learn the facts about people with red hair, light skin and freckles.
I should have known better! You never cared about my birthday at all!
Jesus, it's freezing out here. He, he could be dead.
Those things are stupid, Cartman. They just stick your hand in cold spaghetti and tell you it's intestines and stuff.
Yeah, all you have to do is fart some more, Cartman! And the visitors are sure to come!
So how'd your date with Ms. Ellen go?
Well, all my life I felt I was black! I've listened to hip-hop, I watch UPN and I love playing basketball! My body doesn't reflect who I am inside.
Hi. My name's Kyle. Uh, I understand that your country flies people into space for money.
Yeah. I'm sure whatever that Super Adventure Club does is pretty tiring.
That's it!  I don't care about the fate of the world! Screw it!
Oh my God, this book says that negative and positive are the same thing; that real and not real are one.
Don't be stupid, Cartman! Butters doesn't have that much blood in him!
Holy crap, dude!  Hey look! He's got ice cream! 
I need to get a nurection for my dad.
I said I'm sorry, you piece of sh- 
Eh it's "Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow." I taped it last month.
Guys, stop, stop!  We don't have to do this!
Did you make it to your job interview?
Come on Starvin' Marvin, I want you to meet my little brother.
Don't worry, Ike. Squirts is fun. And I'll be right over there in the next building. 
We came on our own 'cause our friend's purity ring is killing him.
I don't care! You're not making me wait in the van again!
Just do it again, Cartman, and don't make it talk! 
I can hide it!  Nobody ever has to know!  I can't ever let anybody know!
Goddamnit. We're gonna take a short break. Be back in five. 
Look, we're sorry, you guys, but the balloon just went up in the air and the dude sang a song and we were suddenly there.
Yeah. People are willing to pay big money to see Kenny do this stuff.
If she holds his hand in that theater it'll be all over.
You just feel bad for yourself that you're in detention!
Cartman, I really, really have a problem with what you're doing. I object to it morally, and I find it grossly offensive. 
Hello. There are certain networks that we see as harmful to our families, and we want them removed, please.
I don't think it matters, dude. This giant snake is gonna kill everyone soon. 
Can you imagine it, Stan. A mind, emptied by that... thing.
We'll get back in time for a Christmas adventure.
Just stop it! That's enough! You aren't reading another sentence of your stupid story!
What I understand is that you totally screwed me over!! So why should I have to listen to you?!
Ask her if we get the watch right away.
You can't do this! We were gonna build an orphanage! So the crack babies have somewhere to go!
What are you talking about, dude?! I fell down that abyss and there it was!
All right! Now, come on! We have to practice! 
A band! Holy shit, Stan! Didn't you say your dad knows somebody who knows Lorde?
Yeah, they abduct people and they mutilate cows.
This tape makes people freak out wherever it goes.
I need one ticket for my little brother.
Yeah, the High Elf. He'll know what to do. 
How are you going to try to get invited to Casa Bonita this time?
This is our shot at making it into the WWE. To be real wrestlers. 
He didn't do anything. He was always with his new girlfriend.
Wait a minute. I though your father was your mother 'cause she had a penis.
Dude, we've arrived. We're super, awesome, and cool.
Wait, what are you taking Stan's blood for?
Kenny didn't have the ticket stub. It was in his room. So we got all our candy, and you can all go home.
We have to find Red and Green Mega Man for Cartman's birthday party.
You use IntelliLink?? Oh my God! Will you check his records please?
So is it a coincidence that Grandma DID talk to me about going to Jewleeard someday?
Well, he is. It turns out that the bookmobile driver here was the one making love to chickens.
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with dreidel I shall play.
That's us!  "Dear MOOP. This letter is to inform you that Faith Plus One's debut album has just sold one million copies."
Here, give me some money, Cartman!  Lend me money, fat boy!
I- I can't do it... I can't do it. I...
Sorry, Mom. I just had to deal with Ike. He-he's been cranky. 
We know. Believe me, we know. We're reminded every day that you're not Kenny because Kenny... was cool.
Yeah, I noticed that too. Let's go get some ice-cold lemonade.
Stan! Go get the other guys and tell them to meet me at the bus stop in ten minutes!
Wait. It's okay. Look, maybe these people all turned out because they believe in saving films. Maybe they don't even care about the free hats.
But we certainly want to thank you for all your hard work and attempts at being our friend, lame as they were.
Check it out, dude. The camera shoots one frame at a time. So, all we gotta do, is put the right mouth on, according to what syllable they're pronouncing at that frame.
Dude, it's bad enough we have to sit here without you taking a crap every ten minutes!
They didn't believe me. They thought I was pitching a movie.
Meh? Ike, we have a whole day to play XBox! Mom and Dad are leaving!
Dude, this is probably the best episode they've ever done!
Hey, why don't we watch some of those porno movie thingies?
What the hell are you so happy about, fatass?! 
Kenny, all you did after the cat peed in your face was start running around in circles cheering.
What does that have to do with Passover?
Will you stop with the underpants gnomes, Tweek?! We have to work here!  
I don't want to! It's a stupid name! 
Please, tune in and help get America's families back in the living room.
Buy me out?! What are you saying?! What makes you so high and mighty you can buy me out?!
Alright, that does it, Cartman! That's my grandma! You show her some God-damned respect!
It just keeps getting worse. I see stuff from Amazon almost every day. My poor dad has no idea.
You guys don't even make a six-layer burrito!
We all have Attention Deficit Disorder. So we all started taking Ritalin.
Move on?! Our friend was raped, Stan! He was raped, and we all stood there and did  nothing!
Well, it isn't a guy teacher. It's a woman.
Yes, but now we don't have any homework, so we can go see Timmy play downtown at Mile High Stadium
Jesus, man, those Earth Day people don't screw around!
Heheh, we could make you say whatever we wanted.
Fatass Cartman was
not on the school bus today.
What a big, fat turd.
That's not being nice! That's just putting on a nice sweater!
I just don't know what to do. I mean, I hate Cartman with all my heart, but I can't stop feeling ashamed for taking advantage of him. But should I feel ashamed? Oh, whatever lowered the bar is not my fault. So if I kind of go with it, is it really unfair to Cartman?
Look, we're just trying to show you there's other girls out there.
But why? If they're hungry and poor, why don't we just always give them half of our food?
It's all right. He can't kill us unless we agree to duel. 
Ike, you can't come to school with me. 
You might as well just say Pilgrims and Indians were all aliens who came here and made some kind of intergalactic treaty!
But why are you making such strange laws??
-slashed the bus tires in Arkansas! I said so! I told you the minute that I-  -and I told you that-
Are we the only ones here who are completely confused?
Come on, dude. I wanna get out of here.
Tell everyone you made the cow look like that!
Hey! Look at that line!  It's way shorter.
You guys wanna see how long I can hold my breath under water?
I got 'em! Four tickets, 68th row, to Terrance and Phillip! I waited in line since 3 this morning!
Yeah, so, where are they. Let's go get 'em.
So now I should stop liking Chinpokoman because you all don't?
Oh my God. This is like a third-world country.
Oh dude! Dude, this is the part I was talking about. Check out the bassline on this! 
Because, he kinda like looks like Steve Austin, the $6 million man
You were scared Cartman! you almost peed in your pants!
I got it! I got my Chinpokomon game controller! 
He just doesn't wanna look like an idiot, so he wants everyone to think the strike was for something. Just, just give him anything!
Dude, I don't think Kenny's coming back. My dad said those Child Protective Services people are pretty serious.
See, w-we're the official presidents of the Terrance and Phillip Fan Club. A- and... we're... going to see them tomorrow 'cause we can get them to perform at the Earth Day festival.
Hooray for the earth! We must protect it.  And now, as promised, here are TERRANCE AND PHILLIP, on video! 
The thing is, Ms. Claridge, we did a lot of stupid things when we were kids.
Hey Cartman.  I care a lot about him, too. 
It's so unfair! How can my parents do that to me?!
He talked! I swear to Abraham he talked, and he loves rocket ships!
It's Mr. Hankey! I think he's in some kind of trouble. 
Be sure to take me to the same hospital!
Cartman, what is going on out there?! What happened to Stan?!
Yeah? Okay, and you checked with Kenny and Token? He's not just staying at their houses?
What? How the hell do I only have 37 friends?
Yeah, we've shown them amusement parks and malls. How can you expect them to go back now??
Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastards!
Yeah. Check it out.  Ready Ike? Kick the baby!
How is it that Ms. Ellen was suddenly arrested for being an Iraq-
Take a look, fatass! I beat you! You aren't going on Dateline; what have you got to say now?! 
Just give me 30 minutes. Come on, Ike! 
Well, we've got something to tell you about Veronica, Chef!
Oh for sure, dude! It's the most God-forsaken place on the planet! Things are finally gonna be normal around here.
Or if you sold one to an "Eric Cartman"?
No it wasn't, fatass! I saw you do it!
Hey, Kenny. How much for you to eat this?
Well! I hope it lived up to all the hype! You must feel so much better now!
What happened? I thought you were gonna kill yourself.
The author meant to be as gross as possible because it was funny!
Dude, come on Cartman. As employees, don't you think we should get to see what the final secret flavor enhancer is?
You can't do what he wants just because he's the one threatening you with violence!
Would you excuse us for a second?  You just can't expect me to sit there and say nothing. No, Ike, I'm supposed to be looking out for you. So what? I wasn't going to just blurt it out, I was gonna use some tact, but you won't even let me... What? Uh uh! Stop right there, Ike!  Mom, I think maybe you should talk to Ike about love and sex!
I don't know, I-I just thought if we all drank the Mountain Dew, the caffeine and the sugar would help us stay awake. I told Cartman he has to share it.
Yes, I did! I said from the beginning that you would do this!
So then why do you just ignore it using something as stupid as Chipotaway?
Well you made me eat veal and didn't tell me what it was. So go ahead and be angry, you baby calf-killing bitch!
There's not gonna be any robot guards, retard! Just get Kenny! 
We can get people to believe us now!
It was him, dude. I told you, it was Mr. Hankey!
Doesn't anyone understand the significance of "I'm sorry" anymore?
We just wanna warn you: Eric Cartman, the fourth grader, is goin' tuh try and trick you somehow into getting your wiener bitten off by a pony who lives at Denkins' ranch.
All these people are going to be gaming on XBox. You really wanna just game with Craig the rest of your life?
Gosh, I hope he doesn't cut me with his celery hand. 
Look at yourself! You've got to lay off the cheese! 
Mister Father!  We have to ask you something.
Don't fart on your way out; you might make little smoke signals. 
Hold on everybody. This thing isn't even a-
I wish that was good enough, but if you censor out Mohammad, then soon you'll have to censor out more.
How the hell do you have more friends than me?
Dude, I don't wanna watch this thing have a baby.
Bu- but I got these tickets to see Lion King on stage.
Trent Boyett is being released from Juvenile Hall.
We're not kids. We're full-grown men with dwarfism! How dare you assume that all midgets are children! We demand an apology!
Come on, Marvin! We've gotta get your people to Marklar before the missionaries do!
Come on you guys, we need to figure out how to get out of school so we can get my little brother back.
Hay! He's totally underage. She's taking advantage of him.
I believe that you're a broke, ignorant idiot!
Yyeah well, I-I'm sorry I didn't trust you either.
Yeah. Then it cancels out the gay polarity.
Cartman is trying to bring Christmas to Iraq.
Look, we've just gotta get Chef alone. He won't listen to reason with that hooker around.
Wendy, nothing's gonna happen to the egg. You can have it when the week is over and I have my grade.  Freakin' weirdos, man.
It doesn't matter if I am or not. People voted and I stand behind the president.
Hey!  Faith Hilling is not out of style, alright?
Yeah, fatass! Get your fat butt on the sled!
Wow, I guess this really is a big deal.
Oh. Well, come on, we're playing L.A. Noire.
I want you guys to all meet my friend. 
How do you know...  that wasn't your therapy? 
Well, I have this friend, see? And this friend belongs to a certain, Chosen People of Israel. And it... so happens that these chosen people killed your Lord.
Don't be nervous, Cartman. This is gonna be cake.
All I'm saying is that it's gonna take a lot of singing to make up for that!
Butters has been missing for a week! You might have inadvertently gotten him killed!
Because, retard, you're dumb enough to buy Scott Tenorman's pubes for ten dollars!
It's not stupid, Stan. For once in my life I feel like I'm part of something.
Give me that!  Hey! It hit her right in the mouth!
Right. But he can't live with the guilt anymore. Because, even if Jesus wasn't really the Son of God, he was still a nice guy. And he didn't deserve what happened to him in Mel Gibson's movie. I I can't sleep at night. I mean, my... friend can't sleep at night.
Oh no, I d- I don't want to be a bother, I uh-
Ahhh I've seen this before. Whenever they try to distract a robot in the movies, they tell it some kind of paradox, to get its processors all tripped out.
You've got the best balls in the whole world, Chef.
Mr-&#160;! Goddammit. Here, come on. We need to clean that up. 
What the hell does that have to do with American history?
No ending? Well, we can't animate until we have our voices recorded, so we'd better just record what we have and figure out the ending later. 
Yeah.  Hey Riley! Try this hamburger.  Cartman made them himself.
Aww, come on, you guys! It's supposed to be really cool.
Dude, for the last time, don't call my brother a dildo!
He was with us at dinner. Wait. Was he with us at dinner?
...Excuse me, I have to step out for a minute. 
No, don't you see? Cartman never had psychic visions. And neither do these people. The plain simple truth is that nobody is psychic. There's a logical explanation for every psychic story you've ever heard.
Cool. Thanks, Jimmy, well, I'll check it out.
Ike, what's the matter?  Dude, you've been in here crying all morning. What's going on?  Oh. My. God. Ike, a-are you sure about this?
I'm still not inviting you to Casa Bonita.
Hello?  Excuse me. I'm here to pick up Ike?  Uh, hello? Is Ike here?  Hello? 
Alright, alright! If it means that much to you, take the stupid triangle!
Then we'll wait, because we have to clone Muhammad now!
You said "fuck you" to my face, Stan.
Dude, are you sure you wanna do this? Apparently this guy has a black belt in karate.
All right, let's see.  Dammit Kenny, that's not what she said!
Hey wait. I think maybe I have Attention Diffunction Disorder.
Hold it!  Principal Victoria, Mr. Mackey, Mrs. Streible. We have something we need to tell you.
That's what the sixth graders do behind the school at recess. They take way too much cough medicine because they say it makes them see things in their heads.
He got a full dose of the stars.
Yeah, hey, do you think we'll get in trouble for watching it?
He's gone, dude! Butters says he saw him leave.
Is it like a- haunted house or something?
That's great, Butters, but we're not playing Detective anymore. We're playing laundromat owners.
No way, dude, then I'd have to suck Cartman's balls
I wonder why our moms want us to sleep over at Kenny's so bad.
No, dude, you're supposed to put their hand in warm water and it makes them pee.
We have to find a way to get the word out! People need to know pushers are being hired to take advantage of people with addiction problems! There has to be a way that we can get to the news company, and sneak in and somehow borrow their TV signal. If we could disguise ourselves as something ridiculous, then-
Well I didn't have her do it. She did it on her own.
'K.  She says she's been wantin' to break up for a while, and it's nothing against you.
You must have a mom.  You mean she doesn't live here, or she's dead, or what?
Because, if we go to the tobacco company, I know exactly what'll happen. They'll take us in, and then Rob Reiner will show up with all the townspeople, holding torches or something, and there'll be a big showdown until we talk about what we learned, and change everyone's minds - this is all following a formula!
Hey Cartman, I need to talk to you.
All right, it's decided. Let's all write in "Giant Douche."
That wasn't the Mayan apocalypse, you racist idiot!
I'm not from Jersey. I was born here.
Hey Stan. Dude, I want you to have this. It's the twenty bucks I owed you plus thirty dollars interest.
Uh, alright then.  Oh, would you look at that? I've got a corn on my ankle.  Now where did that one come from? That's the fourth one I've had- 
Yeah, but he's some kind of genius, so he's getting advanced placement in kindergarten.
Scott Tenorman is an eighth grader who sold Cartman his pubes for ten dollars, and now Cartman's all pissed off.
I think I see the television department in the back!
But instead, we should all be treated the same, with the same laws and the same punishments for the same crimes . For in that way Cartman can be freed from prison, and we  will have a chance to win the sledding race on Thursday.
That system is totally screwed up and does nothing but wreak havoc!
I don't care if I signed an agreement!
What?! But she looks just like everybody else. Up yours, Tina Yothers! 
You did it, Mr. Hankey. You got rid of all the film people!
Dude, you'd better watch it. The principal's right over there. 
All right, all right!  Dude, what is the matter with you?
Butters, you know goddamned well you didn't write that book!
Because that's what real artists do. People are always gonna find a way to copy our music and swap it for free. If we're real musicians, then we should just play and be stoked that so many people are listening.
Ohhh, no you don't. That isn't gonna work on me, Canadian!
We need you to protect us... from a bully.
Um...  Greetings from Canada.  Well boys, it's aboot time we get to our hoose in Canada, isn't it?
That's because there is no goo, Mr. Cruise. You see, I learned something today. Throughout this whole ordeal, we've all wanted to show things that we weren't allowed to show. But it wasn't because of some magic goo. It was because of the magical power of threatening people with violence. That's obviously the only true power. If there's anything we've all learned, it's that terrorizing people works.
All the cruel jokes and ridicule will finally be over! Are you happy now, God?! YOU made me look like this!
No, it's Cartman. Something's really wrong with him. 
Hey! That's it! That dance! I can ask Rebecca to go to the dance!
Why the hell would you want three copies of the same movie?
I've tried talking to him, but he doesn't want the lawsuits to stop. He's making too much money.
Wull yeah, but ah-I got my brother back.
Terrible. Every time I close my eyes I see the house we TP'ed. I see the tears of our art teacher and hear the screams of her daughters.
Yeah, I think that parents only get so offended by television because the rely on it as a babysitter, and the sole educator of their kids.
We can't miss the final apocalyptic battle between Good and Evil!
I know. But just like you, I feel like I have to try. People can really get hurt, and a joke just isn't worth that.
Eh now,  come on, you guys, we can't take this decision lightly. Whoever we pick is going to be the person we do everything with from now on.
Look. You guys built a machine together that can bend time. If you'll just agree with him, you can build another one and usher in a whole new era of science!
You didn't see a leprechaun, fatass! If you could prove it, I had to suck your balls, but if you couldn't, you had to pay me ten dollars! Pay up!
Whoa Cartman. Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night.
Oh. Sweet, dude. I don't think we have to do this stupid debate now.  Stan?
Jesus, dude. W-w-what happened? It's like, something's lowered the bar to the point that nobody feels any shame anymore.
What is happening to our living rooms? There is a crisis in America, and-
I'm in big trouble, you guys! We have to do something!
Wait a minute. According to this you now own all the rights to Crack Baby Basketball and we got nothing.
Ike, jump down, now! For the love of God, Ike, jump!
Dude, the sooner you eat your peas, the sooner you can try to win some of your friends back. Eh ya you need to Bill Clinton this.
...Kenny, will you tell Cartman to shut up?
What the hell is everyone wearing on their heads?
And if I had just one wish, just one wish in the whole world,
If I had one wish it'd be for Cuba to change.
Because I think that all the Cubans are in pain
All the joy in the world, from sea to shining sea
Doesn't mean a thing if Cubans aren't free
I just can't be very happy, that's certain
Not as long as your Cubans are hurtin' 
Oh, won't you search your soul and find a way to change your mind?
That is my one and only wish.
This must be it. "Cleo Broflovski" That's my grandma. 
Why don't you just sneak in your mom's closet and get a picture when she's changing clothes?
Rotten, they're both really drunk, but the won't have sex.
Stop being a pouty little bitch 'cause you lost, Cartman!
You dumbass, Cartman! Now they're gonna go squeeze his balls!
Kill it, Stanley. Kill it.  Come on Stan, kill it.
I can't, Mom. We're working on our school project.
This is it, Stan. If you strike this kid out, we all get to go home.
David Blaine is doing a big performance in Denver tomorrow night.  We're sure his magic will entertain and astound you!
You're gonna need to kick more ass than that to beat the Cowboys.
Let me guess: you wrote the joke, and Cartman just laid on the couch eating Twizzlers.
I don't think Mr. Jefferson pays enough attention to his son to notice. Come on! 
Ass full of pork fat
jiggles like a Jello mold.
Mouth is flapping, too.
If she wants to be with you, how about you have her tell all these people here?
Ah, I don't know, it just feels like... there's got to be something else going on here.
I've designed it to be the best place for them to live. A place where they can finally have the care and happiness they deserve. And if you think it's a bad idea, I really don't care!
Uuuh, Cartman. We know how you can get $3000.
Hoh Gohod, I popped it!! Oh hit huhurts!!
You son of a bitch! I won't let you win!
That isn't my idea! I saw a bus in a garage a couple of blocks back! We need to modify it!
How are you rich?! Your mom pays for everything!
"Dear Mommy and Daddy: I am running away. I am sorry, but I can no longer handle the monotony of middle-class life. Everyone at school is a fucking idiot, and if one more person talked to me about that Susan Boyle performance of Les Misérables I was going to puke my balls out through my mouth. I love you all, but I have to move on. I'm going to Somalia to be a-" to be a pirate?! Oh shit!
Yeah Stan, we have to go find out if Cartman's pig is pregnant or not.  See ya. 
No, No thanks, that stuff tastes like pee.
Well, Stan I have to harvest my crops before it's too late.
Ah, I thought we were speaking for the children.
Yeah, dude! Kenny just died eight hours ago from that monster! How could he have died back then, too?
Listen, aggotfay! An ailnay ilefay so you can eakbray out of isonpray!
It was Cartman having Butters apologize for him.
Oh Jesus Christ, I had to see it to believe it! What the hell are you doing?!
What, you been living under a rock? This is the new meme, Cat Taylor Swift Reporting.
Yeah. We've come to complain. We don't want a Wall-Mart in our town.
We're sorry, Butters.  Our mind is made up.
Nono, you're right. Somalia is an oasis of treasure and waterfalls. It's totally the pirate's life.
Ah man! I can't keep my eyes open. 
Mr. Garrison, we've been watching Barnaby Jones repeats for eight days now. It's hard to keep paying attention.
You're gonna see it.  WILL SOMEBODY GET ME A GOD DAMNED CHARGER?
Naw, I think I'm through with fads for a while.
Yeah. If we're Jewish, are we gonna go to hell?
It's okay, Ike, you're going to be... okay.
I hate picture day at school! It's always some gay-ass photographer with some gay-ass backdrop of New England!
But we promised the Earth Day people you'd perform.
I don't know.  Oh, great. He's got that stupid beard on again.
Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo. Haven't you guys ever heard of it?
Set an open course for the virgin sea...
Well everyone has already seen it; nothing we can do about it now.
Like a..big hunk of dirt with a carrot sticking out of it.
Did you play the Terrance & Phillip freemium game all day?
Hey Cartman! We're almost to level 20! You giving birth in there, or what?
But you were just gonna take it out in the backyard and put a bullet in its head!
Look, Stam, we-we just wanted to be able to go to the movies and enjoy ourselves, you know? I'm sorry but... you're a bummer to be around. Everything is "that looks like shit" and, and "this is shitty!"
Dude, an awards show just for comedy sounds like a bad idea.
Okay, okay, wewe'll switch off. Starvin' Marvin can stay here for a week, then at Stan's, then with me.
Wait. You guys, I have an awesome idea! We should secretly go around and tell all the students we can, to not check any of the mascots on this election sheet, and instead write in "Giant Douche."
I can't believe how cold it is out here.
No you're not!  I read the brochure, Cartman! If you're under eighteen, you have to have a parent with you to sign up for the Special Olympics.
Mr. Garrison, I'm the only one here. Everyone else has chicken herpes.
Dude, look who I found prowling around in my back yard.
Oh God! Oh God! I have to tell the truth!  Mooooomm! 
He beat us. Because all this time we've been so caught up with how to protect our music that we forgot to just play.
It says, "Read Teetle the Timid Ta-- Taa-- The Taxi--" What's this word?
Alright, here it goes. Cartman, you aren't really here.
No, fatass, I came to get my brother! We all have to get out of here! It isn't safe.
The Earth show can still be good. Just erase everyone's memory so we don't know we're a show.
All right, fine! We don't need you, Butters!
Here's the control panel that operates all the stars.
He didn't want us for sex, fatass! Something is making him say those things.
You get away from me, you crazy woman! 
He said Madonna is an old anorexic whore who wore out her welcome years ago, and that now she suddenly speaks with a British accent and she thinks she can play guitar and she should go fuck herself. 
Guys, Ike has gotten worse. I'm really worried about him. He says he's still seeing dead celebrities.
Well, our friend Marvin and all his people have to live on a part of Earth that sucks ass. They can't grow food or nothin'.
Yeah. Come in for a minute, would you?
Dude, don't you see that it's not? It'd be like, changing Raiders of the Lost Ark!
I DIDN'T THINK THERE WAS GOING TO BE A GOD-DAMNED LEPRECHAUN!!
No, ah I didn't lie to you. Ah I was um... uh I felt better and then the guys called and said that they felt better and uh-
Just let us stay up a little longer, mom. Mr. Hankey's gotta show up. He always does.
You've been on your fucking phone since we started!
Dad? Dad! What the hell are you doing?!
Yes we do! We have a sweet name.  I was wrong, Cartman. "Washington Redskins" is the perfect name. I think maybe I was jealous that I didn't come up with it.
God-dammit. Come on, guys. We gotta go to Butters' house.
Dude, we can't do a presentation on underpants gnomes. Mr. Garrison will fail us because you're making it up.
And so, red hair, light skin, and freckles are all passed down genetically. A child's red hair is not determined by the lack of a soul,  but by the melanins which control the pigment in all of our skins. Thank you. 
Oh my God, they killed Kenny. You Bastard!!!
Hey, fatass! Instead of laying in bed eating, why don't you come and help?!
All right.  All right, I guess it's possible.
You're okay with everything you think going up on the Internet?
Craig, we have chosen you to join our Peruvian flute band!
I can't wait to see him!  He's gonna be so glad we came!
See? We're just watching cartoons, like always. Nothing's changed.
All right. Thanks a lot for helping us, dude.
Hey... Hey, we know a place! We know a place where everything is just happiness and joy. And no humans are there to mess it up.
Yeah. And I can still get my A!
Maybe you should go talk to the counselor.
The only reason we scored high was because we took the answers out of Garrison's desk! And you know it!
Mom! Dad! I have awesome news! The doctor who gave Mr. Garrison his sex change said he can make me tall and black. 
Cartman, Cartman! I heard that Stan somehow found out about our plan!
I'm confused. Did Ally Sheedy take that personality test?
You don't know what you're talking about, fatass!
'Kay, so now just click on the little soil button...  and then maybe put a sign up to comment on my farm...  Okay, now I can read the sign you put up...
Token actually pays attention in school! Unlike you, fatass!
Ech, even if it could work, how would we go about shutting it down?
I've had enough of the Bible. What has it gotten me?
Ah I'm sorry, but I don't really care. I just want to know what medication my little has been getting from you, and why?!
Well wait a minute. Don't you see what happened?
Because anybody who thinks 9/11 was a conspiracy is a retard!
...Oh, and I hope one day to be an investment banker.
Yeah. He's almost as bad as that guy on Full House.
I can't keep doing it, Wendy. I know he has an illness, but goddamn, it uh, it's like being around a black hole that just sucks the life out of everything.
This is amazing! But wait right here. I've gotta go tell my friends about this! 
There is no such thing as a funny fuse, Cartman. You felt bad.
Well, we can still pre-tend like we know what it means.
Chop off his wee wee?! Are you sure?!
He's a magician named David Blaine, dude. He kicks ass.
You know what I like best about you? You don't say, "hella," like our Cartman does. I swear, if he says that one more time, I'm gonna kill him! 
Knock it off! I don't have your stupid picture!
Dude, I don't think this is very sturdy. 
When I say "go," you slam your electric wheelchair into high gear. Okay, Timmy?
Well, then you gotta ride it out, Butters.
It's just that... I really need this A, Stan. And Bebe did say you almost broke your last egg.
Our parents won't let us have weapons, dude. 
Oh, just this really really old lady who wishes she was still only 45. 
Hm, I think he took that pretty well, I think.
How long has it been since you've been back there.
Hey Stan, now that Terrance & Phillip has been taken off the air, what are we going to do for entertainment?
Dude, if my mom knew I was in here, I would be in super big trouble.
He said his wish is not to die. 
It was just thirty minutes of two women queefing on people!
Kick ass, dude! Cartman's mom throws the best birthday parties ever.
Oh, you're doing it, or else we're gonna bust your whole scheme wide open, and tell your mom you haven't actually been at your drug rehab this whole time!
