Dude, my mouse-clicking finger hurts.

Oh, good. Kenny's back to normal.

Why would anybody send this asshole money? 

Just play the game, fatass!

Cartman, don't be such a baby! We're supposed to be rugged outdoorsmen!

Nuh-uh.

What happened? I thought you were gonna kill yourself.

No, that's a hair dryer!

Wrestling is awesome!

I am Tooth Decay. Your teeth shall be mine. With candy and treats I will take-

It's so unfair! How can my parents do that to me?!

Whoa, dude, this house is huge.

Yeah. So what's the first syllable?

Wwait, what do you mean? Stan's in danger?

Look at yourself! You've got to lay off the cheese! 

Kenny!

Aw, come on. Ned's faking it. That frog was just a piece of plastic!

There. Do you really want that asshole to win?

I made you out of clay.

They said that Chef works in one of these buildings 

We didn't realize hunger made you feel so bad.

What do you mean?

What

Not when  if I say he's sick and put him to bed right away.  No, go away! Bad dog!

For Odin! For Asgard!

Dude, what's wrong with him?

Ahem, wha? What's going on, Stan?

How many ways are there to take it?! It's just a stupid word!

Okay. We won't tell anybody as long as you are super nice to us, every day, from now on.

Okay.

Stan?

Oh please, no reason! I got AIDS from him!

You... bastards...

It... doesn't... quite roll off the tongue.

Why not?

The first what?

Over a hundred.

Or if you sold one to an "Eric Cartman"?

Hey, Kenny. How much for you to eat this?

Here, Pip, you throw. 

No dude, that makes you gay!

In our deal with EA Sports we are giving them the right to use images of the crack babies and their names. But we aren't paying the crack babies.

What do you mean?

I bet you don't win.
They don't let big fat asses
perform on TV.

That's a retarded idea, Cartman!

Hi. We were wondering why fatass  I mean, Cartman, hasn't been showing up for school.

Stan?

I made you out of clay.

You bastards!

Aw,  Jesus Christ!

Cartman!! Wake up you fat piece of crap!! 

You're a murderer.

Hey Stan, now that Terrance & Phillip has been taken off the air, what are we going to do for entertainment?

Huh, Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastard! 

Yes.

No, I'm being totally serious. That is the best idea you've ever had. You should run away to Mogadishu. You should go there right away. I'll even help pay for your ticket.

Larry and Brad Stoltsky

I'm sorry, Ike. 

No! I don't wanna look like this!

We're gonna win $10,000! 

Yeah! You're dead!

Your girlfriend doesn't even like you, Stan the Man! She likes me!

It says right there "a parent has to be with you to sign up," and you'll never get your mom to agree to something so horrible, so ha! 

Sooo, theoretically, if someone was to step in, it would beee, okayyy?

Can we just get going, please?

There are greater things at work than what you understand.

I guess so.

Who said I'm inviting you? 

This is your fault, Cartman! Now we're gonna fail!

Oh good! Cartman's back from the junkyard.

Yeah. Stan said they're having them over for dinner tonight.

Did you eat too many pork rinds last night? 

Bulk up to what, fatass?

You guys don't understand! His wacko teacher is like a schoolgirl! They pass notes to each other in the classroom, they have sex at her house over lunch break,  and during class they sneak out and kiss in the hallways! 

Uh, yeah! I agree! Uh- my fragile little eight-year-old mind didn't know how to deal with what I was seeing. C-Cartman should be punished!

Well, go on, smartass, and do it!

Dude, that's fucked up.

Goddamnit. We're gonna take a short break. Be back in five. 

Really?

Dude, what actually makes total sense about it, if you look at it, is that the crack babies are finally getting some attention and the care that they need.  Yeah. It's pretty cool, dude. Because most of these babies would normally not even get out, you know? Huh, or be able to do anything.  Just because we are making money doesn't mean that those babies aren't benefiting. It isn't exploiting them. They're finding a useful place in society. What's so unethical about that? 

Dude, I don't think Kenny's coming back. My dad said those Child Protective Services people are pretty serious.

So then, who was responsible for 9/11?

But nobody wants a Wall-Mart here!

No way! There's no real connection between us. It was all a big lie.

How do you know...  that wasn't your therapy? 

Get out of here, you piece of garbage! You wanna smoosh, go creepin' somewheres else!

I think if we try Kenny's neighborhood, we might find a- 

Yeah, but something is wrong with my brother and it might be your fault!

We did it guys. We finally taught Cartman a lesson. I'll bet that now, Cartman is gonna have a long hard think about how he treated gingers.

Should be the next one. 2778 Mala Vista Drive. Wait, this is City Wok.

Aah I think you'd rather hear this in private!

We don't want you to die.

These people aren't going to prove anything. To believe any of this you either have to be a liar, or stupid.

Thanks a lot, Ike!

Isn't that fascism?

Don't make me do this.

Thanks.

Dude. That's a pretty fucked up dream.

Wow, cool.

How is it that Ms. Ellen was suddenly arrested for being an Iraq-

No it wasn't, fatass! I saw you do it!

Oh good. I don't?

So what?

Four white birds!

Where?!

Show us.

Wow! Those are some pissed off turkeys!

Going away? For how long?

Dude!

Hyaaaa! 

Well, because you got good coordination, sharp reflexes, and you're fucking fat.

How many tickets can we put you down for?

Noo! No.  Noo! 

Is this the right house?

Another devastating loss for the Cows last night, Eric. They were ahead in the game until Kelly Anderson started crying because she missed her daddy, who's on a business trip in Thailand. Uh, Kelly was so upset she couldn't play, and the Cows had to forfeit.

Chef.

Yeah, I don't even know if I'm gonna watch it anymore.

You'll never get a platinum album doing Christian rock, Cartman! It was a stupid idea then, and it's a stupid idea now!

Dude, you've been sitting at your locker crying since lunch break. Clearly, something's going on.

So you fucked a bunch of chickens?

Try it.  We'll see you in a while, we got to go get Cartman's pig.

Dude, have you seen my parents? 

It's Mr. Hankey! He hasn't shown up yet.

Mee tooo.

We don't know who else to talk to.

How hard can it be? Look at it. 

Liberace gay.

Well, it, it looks like...

You f-figured this thing all out?

That was such über pwnage

It's crazy, dude! They're saying it's because I agreed to the latest terms and conditions on iTunes!

We know. Believe me, we know. We're reminded every day that you're not Kenny because Kenny... was cool.

Hey. Uh, this is Stan.

Here! Here, I found one!

Dude, we've been working this case since two-thirty!

What else has big round squishy globes? 

What?

It's right over here by uh-

But our big game with Lakewood is Saturday!

Chef, the police are asking questions about you!

I don't know. I think... we've been given another chance.

Really? That's what you guys would do?

God, I hope this works.

Yes he does!

What a dick!

You bastards!

I was trying to make an appointment to see the principal about getting excused on Friday. So I can take my brother to go see Yo Gabba Gabba Live.

Heidi Turner said you asked her to borrow superglue last week.

Wow, what did you write about Cartman?

I think the other dog's the one that's confused.

There! You see?! This is what happens when Cartman is allowed his right to free speech!

All right, fine, Cartman! You really want me to go in there, I'll...  Dude, Cartman, what is that behind you?

That's not how a croc sounds, you fatass penis!

What is it?

It's okay, Ma.

Don't you guys think this is a little suspicious? We should buy something else so it doesn't look obvious.

You said you could get us money, Cartman!

Dude, it's Cartman. He's just being a dumb-ass like always.

Don't get scared up in the mountains Cartman.

Kenny didn't have the ticket stub. It was in his room. So we got all our candy, and you can all go home.

Hoh hoh hoh!

Dude, everyone's trying to figure out who you are.

They kind of look like us.  I mean, Stan's got blue eyes and I've got a sharper nose, but I mean, they kinda look like us.

Oh, you are not doing that again!

That guy is wearing a digital watch.

...French fries... pizza... french fries...  come on, Cartman.

He might be right, dude.

Stan, there was never anything between Wendy and I.  I wouldn't go out with my best friend's ex-girlfriend.

You do??

No. We just have to show him that there's other girls out there. I say we take him to Raisins.

When was that?

(Yes. I promise I'll read.)

I went online posing as a boy who would have sex with older men, and told them to meet me here. My plan worked perfectly!  Whoa.

I am not full of meecro- what? Look, the word "shit" first showed up in English in the 1340s, the same time as something called, "The Black Death".

Two, one. Go Cartman!

You need to freeze some of your ass off.

Damn it, he's still there.

Mr. Hankey, no!

What?! 

Dreidel dreidel dreidel-

Which one is the good Cartman?

He catches the feesh so, then he can make money.

What?

You bastard!

Well wait a minute. Don't you see what happened?

I didn't know you were depressed.

No, Cartman. You said nobody will have to be grounded. We're not playing dirty!

I'm scared!

A-all right, let's split up and look for a passageway. E-everyone take a different direction.  Oh man, we're in big trouble here.

Dude!

Ex, excuse me?  My name is... Brad. And uh I need to report a crime. Anonymously.

Oh.

So what should we do now? It's Saturday and we have to have as much fun as possible.

I can't take it anymore! I gotta go volunteer, dude! 

What?

I can't understand him.

This is just startin' to look like another one of those times where it-it's gonna end up with the whole town turning out, it's a big showdown happening, and us havin' to talk about what we learned, and I say we just stop right now, and go play cards or something.

I'm sorry.

Mr. Jefferson just seems like he wants to be a kid, not have one.

Hey you guys! You guys are not gonna believe this!

Would you guys stop!

He said, not now, Craig!

Dude! All those choirs are the same. They don't even really sing. They use prerecorded tapes.

This is our new Ethernopian, Starvin' Marvin. 

Word!

My parents said I can't go.

Yes. It's because the Pharaoh won't give the Hebrews what we want! God is angry.

Guys, stop, stop!  We don't have to do this!

Like a..big hunk of dirt with a carrot sticking out of it.

Oh thanks, dude.

Mr. Derp?

Well, look at it this way: statistically speaking, we're safer inside a car with an old person driving than outside.

What about Dan Rather? Do you think he's real?

My potential hasn't even been reached.

Now, Cartman!! 

How can you be willing to kill people for a holiday special? What's wrong with you?

Yeah.

Oh, "A I D E S," aides.

All right!

We're just gonna fly to California and break into George Lucas's house. What's stressful about that?

It just keeps getting worse. I see stuff from Amazon almost every day. My poor dad has no idea.

I don't either.

We'll do it! We'll do it!

Kill it, Stanley. Kill it.  Come on Stan, kill it.

Okay, I got a text of the Russian guy's podcast. It's all a bunch of links to eBay.

Thanks.

David Blaine is doing a big performance in Denver tomorrow night.  We're sure his magic will entertain and astound you!

W-well, 'cause we want all of those fags to get out of town.

And Cartman for having a whore for a mom.

No.

Oh! Hey, Kenny.

No, don't you see? Cartman never had psychic visions. And neither do these people. The plain simple truth is that nobody is psychic. There's a logical explanation for every psychic story you've ever heard.

What??

Huh?

Dude, I don't wanna see a bunch of guys' penises!

No.

I don't believe it!

Hey, what happens to me in the future?

Fine!

Come on, dude. We've gotta get out of here. I don't know what they're planning next, but it can't be good! 

I hear your parents might give up selling meth for good.

I'm not from Jersey. I was born here.

Boars?

How come we never get opportunities like that?

Me too.

Kenny! What's it doing? 

Tattle-tale?! Do you know how serious this is?!

Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?! They're identical!

What?!

Thanks. 

Yeah! You got served!

How stupid do you think we are?! Now you die on that cross and get resurrurected before I kick your ass!

Grandma's watching me. Always watching me.

Ike, you can't possibly want this. We have to tell Mom.

Dude, this book says I don't exist unless I think I do. But what if I don't?

Give him your food stamps, Kenny!

I knew you were!

But dude, check out my new Trapper Keeper.  It has five different compartments for each subject in school,  and it's all covered with pictures from Dawson's Creek.

All I wanted was to play one level of Call of Duty and you know what Ike told me? He said the living room was for old people.

Yeah. And I can still get my A!

Now look, Butters, when the girls bring out the future-telling device, pay attention to how it works. Once you know how to operate it, just grab it and get the hell out of there.

Don't... do that!

Well, I finally got my family to use the living room for an hour each night.

What?

Yeah, none of us wanna marry Butters.

No! No God damn it no! I'm telling you you're wrong! There, there's no way I can have HIV! Unless maybe...  Oh my God. That son of a bitch! 

Cool! Maybe we can do that to Cartman's cat.

Principal Victoria, there's something you need to know! Cartman's Tourette's isn't real! He's faking!

It's not enough! Ever since Kenny switched sides, there are more kids that wanna go with PS4 on Black Friday.

You should probably listen to him, dude.

Dude, you need to snap out of this! So Wendy left you for Token. What are you gonna do? Just be miserable your whole life?

All right, Kenny, let's go!  Kenny?  Kenny!  Don't worry, Kenny. You didn't die for nothing.  We're gonna get Wing back as our client and... and make a ton of money! I swear it to you!

Okay. Okay, you're right.  Oh uh Cartman: thanks.  Cartman?  What the hell? 

Yeah. Why is that good news?

Aah.

Why's your sister so mean to you dude?

Not your dad, Cartman! What's your dad got to do with this?!

Whoopie.

Aunt Flo?

Hoh! Uh, Rebecca. There's this dance, see, at the school, and um,

God damn it!  Wendy, Stan wants to know why you break up. 

That's nice, kid. I knew Mr. Hankey before he was even famous.

Wing?

If you want to make sure I'm not switching sides, Cartman, you don't have to worry. Stan is wrong.

We can't give him over to the gingers!

They got us a truck, and an airplane, and Mr. Worf! The calves are gonna be okay!

Dude. 

Good job, dude!

We're firemen!

We'd better be. We've been in line for almost an hour!

Yeah, I don't know what to do with it, though. Well, see ya.

Mr. Hankey? Mr. Hankey, is that you? Hello?

Why?

I hate this town. I-I really really do.

Dude! That thing is huge!

Disposing of the doll wouldn't be easy. He would have had to have brought a shovel to decapitate it.

Yeah?

Where's what?

Dick Cheney?

Look, maybe he's forgiven us. I mean, we were only in preschool

South Park.

Wow, that's cool!

I wish that was good enough, but if you censor out Mohammad, then soon you'll have to censor out more.

This is stupid!

This is terrible, dude! Maury Povich parades these poor people around on his show like carnival freaks! And then gives them prizes at the end after they joked about it. What a dick!

Look, Stan, you want me to just take care of this egg?

...I hate you so much. 

Goddammit, say something!

Wow! These are huge!

I don't know what to do. I just can't seem to get my friend numbers to go up. I'm desperate. That's why I came to you.

Pot's illegal too, but people still manage to find it. Ever since that first time Kenny cheesed, he hasn't been the same. You've all noticed the change in him. I'll bet Kenny's at home cheesing right now.

It's worth a shot. Come on, you guys, we can do this.

What's up?

Uh, okay. Then what?

"The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few?" That was Wrath of Khan.

Okay.

You're welcome. 

No. 

Why?

What are you talking about, fatass?

Hey, what about that stupid panda?

My life can't get any worse!

You bastards!

Well?

We'll see!

So stop doing it!

Good idea.

Dog parade?

Token.

They killed Kenny!

What?!

Who took all the pizza and the cake?  What the hell?

Who, Jimmy?! Who pays you?!

Whoa, that was cool!

Uh, Mr. President, my name is-

Officer Barbrady!

Now what?

Uh oh, they're closing!

We have a dead friend.

Yeah, dude, your Uncle Jimbo sucks ass!

Butters?

All right, all right, you could be Jesus, you tubby cry-baby!

You can't leave! The show starts soon!

Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastards!

Goddammit Cartman, will you stop wasting time? I wanna get this over with!

Do you think we can still make it in time?

Hey, yeah! I almost forgot.

Ike found out last night. My mom's having sex with the UPS man.

I don't know.  Let me go check. 

Could I please one of your piping-hot farts in my mouth?

You're gonna need to kick more ass than that to beat the Cowboys.

Ass-raper.

Well, so then WWE will recruit us and not them.

What?! Tell us!

You guys, do you really care what a bunch of girls have to say about how you rank in looks?! 

I don't believe it.

What the hell are you doing?!

But what are we gonna do?

What is a proc-tologist, Chef?

Yeah! All you have to do is fart some more, Cartman, and the visitors are sure to come!

Hey, uh that's, that's kinda cool.

Yeah, right.

Come on. Let's go see how Cartman is doing with his uh, urection.

Well, we'd better get working. Cartman, you go home and call all the pet stores in the phone book.

Hey!  How about you come to school with me tomorrow, so I can at least prove I'm not crazy to my friends.

This is exactly what you would do if they found lice in your hair! Try to lead the charge against somebody else to take the suspicion off of yourself!

Well? Now what are we going to do?

What the hell is this?

Wow. I think I owe you one, Cartman.

Cartman?

We can't.

How was jail, fatass?!

Stan, you can use family love as a weapon against Shelly.  The next time she's gonna kick your ass, just tell her, "Shelly, you're my sister, and I love you."

Remember the time when we got an elephant to make love to a pig?

It's not too late to do what's right. Give us the print. There's still some good in you, Mr. Lucas. We know there is. 

You don't wanna eat it?

Get away from me, Cartman! 

Yeah huh!

What are you talking about?

Whoa.

Dude, calm down.

Yes, Mr. Garrison, I have to go now.

You can't keep it.

CHEF! 

Cartman?

Uhhh... I'm not sure.

Did you ever know any famous people?

No it's not, Cartman. You know, there really are couples out there who are missing children.

Well, he screwed us by makin' something up; I say we do the same thing.

E-excuse me, w-we aren't going back now? Aren't we done?

Jimmy, exactly what part of the fishsticks joke did Cartman write?

Why the hell don't people tell me these things?!

Aww crap!

I'm not a dick, I'm like Gandhi!

All right. Thanks a lot for helping us, dude.

Great.

Dude, that would have to be like, the best party ever.

Mom, Dad!

All right. Come on you guys, we have to get back home. 

HA! I knew it!

I used a bunch of bones from the butcher shop.

Yeah, I bet she does.

But you accepted money from the Canadian government! To push a freemium game on us! Why would they do that?!

It isn't fair. I spent weeks preparing my speech on Latino culture.

He just said... "Where's Stan?"

Carpal tunnel! Carpal tunnel! It's aaaah! 

And then takes you to Chipotle, and buys you more?

Oh crap! 

Oh, cool.

What?!

Hey, Jesus! Ih-if you win the fight, can you turn Kenny back to normal?

Oh, thank God!

No dude, Butters' pee is in there.

Nooo!

They want you to have sex, God-damnit!!

You're going home, Willzy-x! 

What the fuck?!

...What? 

Screw you, fat ass!

Dammit!

There, ten mediums and five medium-rares.

Uuuh, we didn't get them.

Just get to it already!

Bill Cosby.

And that makes sense to you?

O-hoho he's dead. Mr. Hankey's dead. 

We need some help identifying an ancient English stone.

What's a "home-schooled kid"?

It worked!

Oh, brother, here we go again. Cartman, there is not a sound frequency that makes people crap their pants!

We got six days to make it to Los Angeles. If we keep our stops to a minimum, we should be able to get the episode pulled just in time.

Aagh! Stop that!

Look, I doubt we could break a million together anyway.

Yeah. That's right.

Stan, are you alright?

What? Why?

Coup de grah, Cartman

I am happy, Stan. I'm thrilled.

Yeah!

A family! So THAT's why you haven't been able to spread Christmas cheer.

Are you guys having a meeting or something?

Dude, it's coming through the window! 

Butters?  Why?

That's retarded! You didn't come up with that experiment, Cartman, you saw it in that movie, The Thing!

Wait! dude, LOOK! 

How is that gonna help?

Shut up, Cartman!

With genetic engineering, can you make an elephant smaller?

Here!  Everyone drink some Mountain Dew!

It's true. We think that word might be plaguing our friend, Kenny.

He's just... changing a lot. He walks around angry, telling me I'm stupid and, and all he talks about is sex.

Good guess, dude!

Did we?! Maybe we could have stopped them!

Well, Kyle, I I gotta go.

Please, sir. I came because I don't think Ike belongs here. Family isn't about whose blood you have in you, family is about the people who cared about you and took care of you. We're not the same blood, but I love my little brother. We've taken care of him because he needed us to, and that makes us more family than anything. 

Nono wait. I I know how you can reverse it, Cartman.

What the fuck is going on?!

The Internet?

Now we just gotta wait for his urection, and I can give it to my dad.

But I never practiced quarterback.

That's amazing.

And where is your mom?

No, Butters. Look what it's done to you. It's made you even lamer than before.

Jesus, it's freezing out here. He, he could be dead.

Tweek.  Pip

There, what do you think?

It wouldn't work!

Who said that?

Stop wasting the tacos on your hand, Cartman!

Hold on. I'll be right back. 

I wonder how come Cartman's not in school today?

(I need some help! I can't take it!)

Dude, it's Scuzzlebutt! Cartman wasn't lying.

I just do, Stan.

It's so awesome, dude. Our company already has a hundred backers. And we still have 14 days to go!

He's going to kindergarten because he's a genius!

I can't wait to watch Terrance & Phillip with Bebe.

Ungh, gay, dude.

Give it time, it'll grow on you.

Aaaaah! 

Go, Ike!

Oh, so the gallant knight now comes to rescue me from the bowels of mediocrity! Oh, thank you, your royal lordship! 

Jesus, this sucks! All they keep doin' is dancing around!

Stan! It worked!

Damn, CAA is pretty impressive.

Like you really need it, hippo-ass!

Woo-whataya mean?

God-damnit!

Me too.

Everything turned out okay for those people. And so now you can laugh.

Goddamnit, you see what happens when you spread this stupid crap, fatass?

Steve! Steve, look out!

Get out of here, Cartman, we're eating dinner!

Then we'll wait, because we have to clone Muhammad now!

Phil Collins is playing Lalapalala's, and because we're all doing so well in school now, our parents said they would take us.

Eric, sources are speculating that third-grade student, Pete Thelman , pees sitting down like a girl. We've also got confirmation that Sally Turner  stuffs her bra. And Clyde Donovan has only one testicle.

I mean, that if-

No.  Couldn't be.  Oh, my God.

But if the tape must be brought to the House of Butters, who else can do it?

Nuh, you've gotta sound fatter.

Because you just said, "here in my room"!

What's a VHS? 

Yeah. It just proves we need to learn not to profile one race of people. Because, actually, most of the world hates us.

All right, what do you guys wanna ride first?

Well, our friend Marvin and all his people have to live on a part of Earth that sucks ass. They can't grow food or nothin'.

Wow...

Gosh, I hope he doesn't cut me with his celery hand. 

Officer Barbrady, Butters didn't TP that house.

But dad, he always sh...

What's going on?

Oh wait. Wait, I'm supposed to play here.  Hey, Mick, w-would you mind if I stepped out for a sec?

But I did! Ah, I brought democracy to Cuba!

But Chef always helps us with our problems. When we have a problem, Chef sings to us and makes it better.

That's not fair!

See Cartman, your mom is on the cover.

Uh, sir, d'I have a lot of homework to do tonight and I was-

You do not have Tourette's Syndrome, fatass!

This is awesome!

From public school, your house is just a flicker of light.  Don't you want to go out? All you do is... stay in your house and... study

It's good to have you back, Cartman.

Mr. Hankey!

Uuuh, n-no blood for oil.

No.

Yeah. She's having sex with a boy. 

Because- because that's not even entertainment! I mean, it's just, just, rehashing shit, isn't it?? It's like everything these kids are into these days, you know, it's just... rehashed shit!

Yeah, I guess.

'Cause old ladies are fat and you are, too!

Hello?

Wow, it's been like two days.

This is fuckin' ridiculous!

What is happening to our living rooms? There is a crisis in America, and-

What?

...You got Raging Pussies tickets??

Yeah. Then it cancels out the gay polarity.

Please don't cancel us. Please.

No, no, no.  We want to make little pot-bellied elephants that people can keep in their houses as pets.

That was cool!

I don't know.  Oh, great. He's got that stupid beard on again.

How do you know that?

God Dammit!

Hey dude.

Photon rifle, whatever. 

So can I go to the Magic Camp, to learn how to become a full member? All the other guys are doin' it, and it's only $69.95.

Please, I need to talk to the people inside. They can't set off that nuke.

Dude, it's got a hundred twenty eight gigahertz D-RAM.

You're too fat to be Kenny.

Go fuck yourself, Cartman!

We uh, we have special permission?

Hey! Isn't there where Stark's Pond used to be? Where we used to kayak and fish?

But we promised the Earth Day people you'd perform.

Okay.

But we will have to sleep, dude.

Even the dumbest lie can have big consequences.

We were throwing rocks at cars.

That's the Catholic Church!

What a stupid asshole!

Oh, what the hell?! 

It was just thirty minutes of two women queefing on people!

Well I don't know. You're just the only grownup we trust.

Oh God, here we go again.

Hey, look. The aliens are getting ice cream.

Tweek?

That fat turd up there is the one who set up you and Token 'cause he thinks blacks belong together! 

Aw, just forget the whole thing then!

I see... a man... with a baseball cap.  He's killing now... Oh! I'm seeing it all flash before my eyes! The guy's name is Michael Deets, and he lives at 621 Castillo Street. He's usually there between seven and eleven p.m.

No, see? There's people of all colors. And they added a black guy as one of the hangers, too, so it's not racist.

Cartman, there's something I need to tell you.

It's hard to be a Jew on Christmas
My friends won't let me join in any games
And I can't sing Christmas songs or decorate a Christmas tree
or leave water out for Rudolph 'cause there's something wrong with me
My people don't believe in Jesus Christ's divinity
I'm a Jew
A lonely Jew
On Christmas
Channukah is nice, but why is it
That Santa passes over my house every year?
And instead of eating ham I have to eat kosher latke
Instead of Silent Night I'm singing huhash dogavish
And what the fuck is up with lighting all these fucking candles, tell me please?
I'm a Jew
A lonely Jew
I'd be merry
But I'm Hebrew
On Christ-maas

You figured that out, huh?

What?

Mayor! We have the solution to your problem.

I know. Something big is going on. Take a look at this. I did a Google search for "Hillary Clinton Campaign Rally" right? And one of the links was to YouTube, where this Russian guy had a bunch of videos.

That does it. I'm out. 

That's bull-crap! TV shows are gay!

Dude, this book says there could be infinite alternate realities to every reality.

What does that do?

We're gonna make a short animated Christmas card that everyone can watch and play it on the screen at the old drive-in.

I'm last? Last?

Aah! There's another one!

A tattle-tale?! He infected me with AIDS!

I dream about it every night. Every time I close my eyes I see us just running away, running while they ray-rape him over and over again.  And because we did nothing... they got away.

Oh, hi. Is Chef here? We have to talk to him.

Definition?

No. NOO!!

That's better.

What?!

Wahahahah!

You hate this game too?

Stan!

Hey Look! 

Well. Dude, it's uh it's good to have you back.

Because Butters isn't a total dick to me!

We saved the school!

No, it's not cool!

Mr. Hankey! 

You suck, Cartman!

Come on, Blanket. 

What the hell? 

This copy of Lord of the Rings made the young Butters behave quite awfully.

Don't do it, kid. 

Damn it! Come on! I'll try to get more money from my mom. 

It's Mr. Hankey! I think he's in some kind of trouble. 

I'm coming, Ma! 

Wait! Stop! Could I have your attention, please?

Hey Stan.

What am I going to do? My little brother's been abducted by aliens.  You farted. 

Hello, sir. Welcome to the Broflovski Laundromat.

Yeah. We're very good friends. We're very good friends, Stan!

No. This Saturday, for my birthday, my Mom says she's takin' me to Casa Bonita, in Denver, and I get to invite three friends!.

What?!

Whoa, dude.

We can, too!

That dirty no-good sonofabitch!

No, dude!

What a baby.

No. I'm Jewish.

And then she walked over to--

Whoa, dude!

That's, that that's k-kind of what I was thinking.

Well, cou, couldn't just you know, get rid of the part of Tooth Decay?

I know! That's so hilarious!

Oh no! The girls are gonna win!

That's terrible!

Oh, God, when is this gonna end?

Hello? Stan?

Ike!  This way!  Iiike! 

But you were just gonna take it out in the backyard and put a bullet in its head!

You bastards! Come back here! Coomme baack!  Damn it, we were so close!

Whoa, Cartman. Talk about wide load.

I've been thinking, how did shamelessness get to this?  Did it start with fat people on scooters? Or did the bar get lowered way before that? And then I started thinking, maybe it was us.  I don't know, but maybe somehow, we lowered the bar, a long time ago.  And now we're all sittin' here in the stink of it all.  There's no going back, Stan. 

Well, sometimes...

I didn't come to stop you. I... I think you're right, Cartman. I want to help you get the Family Guy episode pulled.

Yeah, but Cyborg Bill is totally gay now. Please Mom? Everybody else has Chinpokomon.

I have to save my little brother! I have to send him away until my parents come to their senses!  Come on, Ike!  Cover me for a while. I'll find a place to hide him and come back.

Cool!

...so no KFC?

Ike!

That's right, we've still got Lorde. You talked to your dad, right Stan?

AAAAAAAAAA! 

You son of a bitch.  You didn't solve your homeless problem, you just sent all your homeless to South Park! 

Are we the only ones here who are completely confused?

Why is Death coming after us?

But I can't, because, what if thinking about it is the only thing keeping my space-time together? 

We promised each other we would never do that, remember?

Why didn't you tell me, Stam? I would've helped.

Oh no, dude!

You're not filling out nicely, you're fatter than ever!

Token?

Awgh, dude, I can't look. 

Just take me home! I don't wanna be here anymore! Take me home!

...Nuh uh.

Uuf.

Me too. 

Well they're doing it!

This is freaking me out, dude.

Dude! Our parents sent us over there to get us sick!

Wait! Wait a minute.  What about a logic loop?

But Butters isn't fat.

My head still feels funny.

So?

Dude, what are we gonna do? We can't win this game.

All right I've had enough! Leprechauns are imaginary!

I'll call you back. 

I know, you're not.

Wooww.

Aw dude, weak.

Wow, I wish we had a stupidest home video. 

Oh no! No, Ike! You are not watching him comment on things!

(Dude, I think you pooed a lot.)

Dah.  Does that mean you'll go to the dance?

Scott Tenorman? The ninth grader?

...What the hell are you talking about?!

Oh Jesus! Now where do we go??

Alright! Get ready, Timmy.

Yeah, the Fat Ass Olympics.

God dammit Cartman!

Oh come on! It's obvious what happens! I get killed by Santa Claus so that Christmas is saved!

To City Wok so we can make our money. God!

Excuse me.  Hello?

All right, fine!

What's that?

Wull, not on purpose.

Ready to go hunting, Cartman?

Why don't they leave those movies alone? We liked them the way they were!

City Wok brought him down to a size 4.

Then stop saying you're not just sure, you're HIV-positive!  This isn't funny, AIDS isn't funny, dying isn't funny, so shut the fuck up!

Don't push me, asshole!

Can I talk to you?! 

I don't know. 

Cartman, what is going on out there?! What happened to Stan?!

You better watch what you say Cartman! You might be poor and hungry some day.

With Cartman singing about his vagina.

Hey! Maybe you can come with me. Then it won't suck so hard.

Oh, she would, dude. She would. 

You con-fessed?

All right, cool.  Let's download some Metallica, and some Stevie Wonder. 

Whoa, dude! She doesn't have any arms!

What?!

Yes. My name is Kyle Broflovski. Can you tell me if I purchased an Oculus Rift headset there?

Huh?

Middle-earth is again safe.

This is it, Stan!  It's just like I designed it. There's the miniature gold course over there! And slides and uh,  excuse me, what is this place?

Me?! It was your stupid-ass writing!

Because it was-

That's nice, Cartman.

I love you too.

Dude, have you really listened to the sixth track? I think it's my new favorite.

Let's just... let's just walk this way. 

Prove it!

You'd better!  Dad, can't we talk to this new Canadian Prime Minister? Iif he knew the situation, he might e-

Alright, we made it!

Nobody gives a crap about your Trapper Keeper, Cartman! 

He's lying.

I don't think Ike wants to go to Squirts.

Dude, where is she gonna get fetus clothes?

What?! What did you say?!

Woohoo!

And we think that that is  a savage hypocrisy, because all crimes are hate crimes. If a man beats another man because that man was sleeping with his wife, is that not a hate crime?

Dude, you'd better watch it. The principal's right over there. 

Yeah! Fragile my ass!

Dude, that video is making people act strange.

Is this all you brought us here to see?

Yeah, what a stupid sport! 

Well, what?

Heunh. 

We believe that films have to be taken away from people like Steven Spielberg and George Lucas because they're insane.

I still feel bad, Cartman

Hang on, Willzy-x. We'll in Mexico soon!.

Get up, Cartman!

You too! Right now! #webelieveinyou! We've got to make him appear! 

I'm a clinically depressed fecophiliac on Prozac.

All made up. Not real. Nothing's real.

What? 

Come on! 

Really? What about?

You!

Is your mom always like that dude?

Uuuh, Chef, you haven't seen Butters around, have you?

Listen to me: the little boy who convinced you to pull the episode is a bastard child. He only wants you to pull it because he knows it will be the end of Family Guy forever!

This has gone far enough!  How can we make people see the difference between being sensitive to obesity and letting fat people walk all over us?!

So then don't have a slumber party if you're gonna be an asshole all night!

All right, all right!  Dude, what is the matter with you?

Aaaa! 

Yeah, I think they already moved in. I saw moving vans in their driveway two days ago.

How? How could the Jews do that to Jesus?

See, w-we're the official presidents of the Terrance and Phillip Fan Club. A- and... we're... going to see them tomorrow 'cause we can get them to perform at the Earth Day festival.

Is that why there's crap on my doorstep every morning?

Who said that?

So what are we gonna say?

Cartman!

You forgot to wear a costume Kenny.

Ow. Quit it!

What the hell??

Pretty good, I guess.

I don't like big corporations.

Killer!! 

Bad.

Alright, it's working!

I don't know, I-I just thought if we all drank the Mountain Dew, the caffeine and the sugar would help us stay awake. I told Cartman he has to share it.

What's the Primary Main Objective?

I happen to be the one person who's putting everyone else's needs before their own!

All the cruel jokes and ridicule will finally be over! Are you happy now, God?! YOU made me look like this!

Uh, can you take my stupid glasses and put them on the night stand. Make sure they're close by, because that fish upset my stomach and I might need them if I have to go to he bathroom later on.

Dude, what happened to your knee?

Yeah! Tim-my! Tim-my!

I'll go.

Oh my God!

You mean that we're forced to pay for the Oprah channel?

This is our shot at making it into the WWE. To be real wrestlers. 

Well you made me eat veal and didn't tell me what it was. So go ahead and be angry, you baby calf-killing bitch!

Hang on, I'm chaining my fire spells for max range.

Steve!

I don't know what the hell to do. The whole world's gone crazy.

Yeah. He's almost as bad as that guy on Full House.

Well, but, this is the jacket I always wear.

We need to genetically engineer our pig and an elephant, but their genes won't splice.

Yeah. Your fat ass isn't on the sled!

Are you gonna take us somewhere or not?!

I know, but, it's really snowy today.

Dude, if these guys are as bad as you say, then we have to do something!

It's not me! I'm here to help you, fatass!

Okay, my turn. 

Excuse me, but Ike has homework he's supposed to be doing.

Oh, awesome.

Well...  Well, what do you want?

Oh no way! Look!  The pan flute band's put in prison, just like what happened. 

We NEED a ride to the hospital!

The South loses this battle, Cartman. They lose the war!

It didn't work! My stupid Jew dad won't lend me money for CDs!

Zipline. 

I know. It's like we have the outdoors back again.

Ike!  Stop the bus! Miss Crabtree, you have to stop this bus!

We don't? But what if we're wrong?

Mr. Garrison won't let us out of school. He thinks we're making it up.

That... was six grand?

Not yet.

Go on, Canadian! Beat it! I'm through getting in trouble for you!

Oh Jesus, we have to hurry!

This ride better be good!

with dreidel I shall play.

They did?

Oh. Well, I certainly don't want you to feel that "Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly on the Table" is holding you back. 

We need him to win a bullriding contest so we can get Terrance and Phillip dolls. Can he still do it?

Where did everybody go?

I'm going to break everything that you own! 

What is it?

The government could come after us, Cartman.

No it isn't, you fat turd! Because, I've learned something today. You just hate-  See, I knew it.

Uh, Chef?

NO.

WHAT?!

We made two dollars.

Does it look like a pig, or an elephant?

Neat, huh Kenny?

What the hell are you doing telling people that we're a gay couple?!

Mom, give me some money!

Ahh-d, excuse me, sir, did I hear you say you needed somebody for your show?

No! Ah!

Dude, have you ever heard of whispering?!

What? No?!

Thee... uhhh. What if the-?

Oo bastards! 

Cartman, don't!

S-so you did superglue it.

Told ya.

No they're not, stupid!

My God-damned little brother's trying to follow me to school, again!

Knock it off, Cartman!

What do you mean? We thought she was with you.

Mine neither. But I double-checked, and Cartman was right. Your period is the start of puberty.

Hey! We're fourth-graders now, too!

Yeah!  I was just hanging out in my room, and then I perioded all over the place.

Uhhh-woo wow! Isn't this great? You guys seeing each other again?

Heee might not come if you're too close to the toilet bowl, Ike.  Come sit by me. 

Oh. Really? Um well that's okay.

Protect it?

Hey, wait! 

I believe that you're a broke, ignorant idiot!

Well why don't you just tell people the truth?!

Hey Stan, isn't that your dog?

Thanks Butters

You're telling me that every time you guys download an update for iTunes, you read the entire terms and conditions?

What do we do now?

What are you talking about?!

Hey, thanks for going through all that to save my life, Stan.

Okay, that's fine.

A boat ride?

Dude, what does the note say?

This is serious. They've been going out for almost two weeks now.

Steve, wait!

Eh-xcuse me, there's been a misunderstanding.

Yeah! g'uh... A, a documentary?

Okay.

God damnit! 

Whoa, dude!

Hurray!

What's this about, Cartman? 

What do you think, Stan. These girls are pretty cute, huh?

Dude! He turned Kenny into a duck-billed platypus.

Wait!  I brought him! I brought him to show you! 

Oh, jeez, we're gonna have to buy tons of these things.

They're Olympic games for handicapped people.

Cartman, you do have pinkeye!

I think it went really good. Those people really got into it.

So now what do we do?

No!

We're gong to New York?

Hey, that's your song for Wendy!

Haha!

What part of being infected with a deadly disease do you find funny?!

Come on, this is ridiculous!

Get back on, fatass! You have to practice!

I'm making a dummy Ike doll. My parents think he's out with me right now, and I have to bring him back for dinner.

Okay, Cartman, what do you want?

I knew it! Don't let that fat turd walk all over you, Jimmy! Stand up for yourself!

That's exactly what I wanted to hear from you all along. Ah uh I still have to take Butters, but... I hope things can be cool too.

Now, don't go saying that. There's always hope. Miracles happen most every day.
To people like you, and me.
But don't expect a miracle.
Unless you help make it to be.
You hope, and I'll hurry.
You pray, and I'll plan
We'll do what's necessary, 'cause
Even a miracle needs a hand!

I know.

Knock it off! I don't have your stupid picture!

Yeah, we know.

Yeah, try to have everyone make peace so it doesn't seem like a big deal.

We just have to show you this new species because you're the Department of Interior guy now. Soon, they'll all be eaten by bears.

How about a brain transplant? 

I want some!

Yeah. Good luck with yours. 

Yeah, let's watch Yo Gabba Gabba, like old times.

I'm not going anywhere!

Yeah. Good job, fatass! 

Stan, it's me.

You don't wash your hands after going to the bathroom!

What? You mean like you don't like the singing, or the lyrics, or what?

Cartman, we should probably talk about our chances.

They said they'd come.

Phew.

Yeah. My Grandma.  She's here?

Hey!  Faith Hilling is not out of style, alright?

Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,

Okay, hang on guys. I'll use my special power to see into the future and find out where we should head next.

Okay, so what's the plan?

Someone who wants a favor.

That's not what I was trending! They took my hash tag and they raped it! Where is Ike?!

Yeah. Just when he was being accepted he has to leave and start over.

Cool, thanks.

This is Cartman. I have to take it.  Hello?

French Canada?

Okay, Ike. You're my little brother, so I have to show you how to celebrate Hanukkah.  This is called a dreidel. You spin it and see where it lands. And you sing this song:
I have a little dreidel; I made it out of clay.
And when it's dry and ready, with dreidel I shall play. Oh,
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay.
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with dreidel I shall play.

Hey, you know, that nurse is actually pretty cool.

Disintegration is the best album everrr!

When the bar gets lowered, Token, we all pay the price. What if Honey Boo Boo was a little black girl? Being fattened up by her mom and talking about grits and hominy?

God job, fatass!

Dad?!

I'm gonna go ask my mom! 

Upstairs! First door to the left!

That looks awesome!

Let's just get this over with!

And Cartman for being a sadistic asshole

No I won't, because you'd eat 'em first, tubby. 

Damn it!

What??

That's what I thought.

Cartman! I will not stand by and let you cheat your way to winning the Special Olympics!

It's more than you've got!

Cool. Cool... You wanna order some dessert?

Please. Please let him go.

Well it's just that, eh, this seems like another one of those times when things are gonna get way out of hands, you know? It's been happening a lot lately. How about this time we just put a stop to it right now?

Yeah. I guess we gotta try to get into that club, too.

Yeah. Come on, Dad, this place sucks. I wanna go.

Butters, you know something, don't you?!

"Oh God it burns! It bur-huhurns!"

Give me back my brother! 

That's it!  You're not getting high again until we have our Okama GameSphere back!

We were- trying to be funny.

Ih it sure is quiet up here in the mountains and it's dry, too. Do you have a humidi-humidifier?

Wow! He looks great!

Hyeah, that poor, poor thing

Throw it away, Clyde!

Cartman, what the hell is that?

I know...

Uh no.

Chef.

You mean to tell me that all this time I've been trying to protect Ike from having his fireman cut off, and he's not even my real brother?!

Stan! Stan, what the hell is going on?!

That's what bothering you? Not the fact that you're a murderer?

...Okay, fine! Here!  Now let's go!

Butters, you don't really believe that, do you?

That is gross!!

I know you don't. 

You knew this whole time? Why?

Yeah, fatass! Get your fat butt on the sled!

Dude, what are you doing?!

Copy, tango. Clear vantage point?

Kenny, we know you really like this girl, but...

Somebody bet on you, Jesus. You said yourself that one person still had money on you.

Please, Ma. I don't think Kenny has anywhere else to be tonight.

You've got the best balls in the whole world, Chef.

No! 

So?!

Huh?

...Not anymore you're not.

They sneak out during class and make out in the hallways!

What'd you say, Cartman??

No it isn't, it hurts! I can't believe they let us play this in school.

Welcome to the team, Token.

I'm not Britney Spears, all right?!

Dude! Do not do this!

Wait a minute. Ha-how the hell did these two guys end up here?

Come on, Cartman! How much do you wanna bet the South doesn't win?!

When Towelie is doing heroin, he doesn't care about anything.

Knock it off! Right now! This isn't funny! At all!

Sorry, Mom. I just had to deal with Ike. He-he's been cranky. 

Sure. 

Take a look, fatass! I beat you! You aren't going on Dateline; what have you got to say now?! 

Kick the baby. 

What?!

But I always read that Native Americans were here, and that Pilgrims and other settlers kind of took their lands from them.

But we certainly want to thank you for all your hard work and attempts at being our friend, lame as they were.

Well come on! 

This is not a woman! It is a succubus!

Can we take a lunch break now?

Really?

How do you know?!

We've got to get him back, dude.

Cool. Thanks, Jimmy, well, I'll check it out.

Come on, Muhammad, the door is open.

Oh dude, check it out. I got a Jake Plummer.

Why the hell was this book banned?!

Stan, Stan, wake up!

But the zombies are coming!

You were right. You were right all along. I thought you were just an asshole when you ripped on Jews, but... I didn't know, I... I didn't know.

What's going on, you guys?

Ike no! Stop!

Whoa. What was that?

'Cause we hate him.

Hey, look!  See Mr. Hankey at the Mall of Nebraska... Wow! We have to go, dude!

Hey.

Yeah. How are we supposed to know that pan flute bands would be outlawed?

I can seriously hold my breath longer than anybody. Somebody time me, all right?

You can't die, Mr. Hankey. You can't.

Hey. Hey, you're that Mysterion kid.

Well, all my life I felt I was black! I've listened to hip-hop, I watch UPN and I love playing basketball! My body doesn't reflect who I am inside.

I got a job, Stan. I am making tons of money doing some really cool stuff.

On Skippy, on Rainbow, on Patches, on Montel. 

Cartman is NOT Kenny's BFF!

He'll view it as a challenge when he's getting his ass kicked!

What the hell?  Ike?

We heard that you might be teaching Minecraft to adults.

Come, on, Kenny! I'll give you five bucks to do it!

Together we are strong! 

Okay you guys, check it out. 

Yeah dude, we made you your own Facebook page. 

You guys, check this out! 

Get ready guys. Whoever is in here is the kid that's hacking our e-mails and phone calls! You guys ready?!

But all the guys are going!

What?? "A-ight"'s not cool, either? When did that happen?

Did you play the Terrance & Phillip freemium game all day?

Oh. Ah, we're trying to reach Oculus Customer Service.

They say they can do whatever they want because imaginary things aren't real!

...That's retarded.

I don't want to kill myself. They rigged this thing to fill with water! 

You bastards!  Hey! There he is! 

Oh my God, this is great!

Stop it Cartman!

Cartman, I thought all you wanted was a Haibo doll!

What??

Dude, what the hell is going on?! Why did they replace Phillip?

But it's not fair! We have to do a full report on the Founding Fathers, and Cartman got out of helping us again!

...Really??

TP her house?

That'd disgusting, dude!

Damnit!  Tell me what to do, Willzy-x! How do we get you home??

Well what the hell are we gonna do? Dress him up in a princess gown and, and parade him around like the parents on those awful child pageants? 

No.

Let me out of here, kid! Why are you doing this?

Do you really think anything's gonna be any different now?!  Do you really think that this will have the tiniest, smallest effect on the world?  It's still the same old world out there. Look.  What the hell?

I think Stan might've been right. Anyway, I think it's going too far. I mean, if I kill myself, it's gonna make my family really sad.

No they didn't.

...But you can't melt ice with a cool song, 'tardheart.

Why?

Dude, why do you care?!

Stan's getting worse, you guys.

Oh, dude, what a little asshole!

What are we gonna do with them?

You aren't gonna cut off his wee wee. Not today, you sick-ass weirdo!

Huh?

I'm supposed to go to the lake with my family tomorrow and swim and play in the stupid sun.

We're gonna teach that fat bastard a lesson!

No way!

Do you see him?

Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,

No dude, we can't go around showing our weapons to people. Our parents'll find out we have them.

Hut.

Grandma??

HAHAHAA! Now I shall rule the --  Aww. Uuugh. God it burns! AAAH! My soul is on fire! Whoa! Oh, I don't like this!  I didn't know it would feel so... dark and evil!

Cartman, this is serious!!!

Yeah. This is like the third day in a row. I wonder what's wrong

Mr. Hankey.  He comes out of the toilet every year and gives presents to everybody who has a lot of fiber in their diet.

"Krocsyldiphic."

Ike's not my little brother anymore?

Chef, you've gotta help us!

Cartman, you are hereby declared a full-fledged retard!

Yeah. We've come to complain. We don't want a Wall-Mart in our town.

Yeah. And we're sorry for turning Ned into a vegetable.

I didn't come here to talk about The Passion, Cartman!

Oh no!

Hooray for the earth! We must protect it.  And now, as promised, here are TERRANCE AND PHILLIP, on video! 

Dude, he talks! The orca whale talks!

Stop who?

Ike, I don't know what to do. All the guys are getting their periods, and I don't think I am. I can't be the last one to get it. I just can't!

What's going on?

You say tomato, but I say Kenny!

Our band can't find a stylistic direction to go in. We need to go down to the mall to buy hundreds of CDs to listen to so we can define our sound.

I'm sorry. You must've been worried sick. I got your sled tangled up with a bus. 

All right, I've had just about enough of this! They told us in school, and on TV, that most people in Pakistan and Afghanistan like America.

...You're a stupid asshole! 

Mr. Hankey?

Of course it smells like ass, retard. It's a sewer! 

Yeah.

Are you insane?!

We can get people to believe us now!

Cartman? Cartman?!

What happened?

Dude, who the hell is Mitch Connor?

We d-didn't think it was that big a deal.

No.

Holy God, dude!

I appreciate what you're trying to do, Mick, but I ain't a charity case yet.

Here's a shoebox! 

You're in a forest! Go take a crap!

Yeah, he was too young to be taken from us.

What?!

Dude, the sooner you eat your peas, the sooner you can try to win some of your friends back. Eh ya you need to Bill Clinton this.

No matter what we think, it's not just a passing trend. We need to realize that the new generation of entertainment is here.  And I, think that's great.

You're not copying my homework, you lazy turd.

"Get ready", "answer the door", Jesus Christ, make up your friggin' mind! 

Cartman?

And Cartman for being fat.

Alright, so did everyone settle on their wrestling names?

Dude! Just 'cause some stupid North Park kid blew his hands off, we don't get to buy M-80s?

Come on, Kenny. You have to get in the circle.

He talked! I swear to Abraham he talked, and he loves rocket ships!

From now on, MOOP isn't about money. MOOP is about music! We're not striking anymore! Who's with us?! 

Dude! Dude, Kenny, calm down!

Hey, Tweek, you got anymore of this stuff?

No, I mean what happened at the Pentagon?!

Because they're an addictive solution to a greater problem, causing disease of both body and mind with consequences far outweighing their supposed benefits.

Dude, Mr. Hankey has magic powers. He can do whatever he wants. 

Cartman, it was actually really lame.

It's pulling us in! 

Dude, what the hell has gotten into Cartman??

Look out! Here comes the great dragon of Perengraph!

Butters! Hey Butters! You have to check this out!

But we spent it!

Ugh. Can't you see this is my dream?? Music is my life!

I know what you mean. 

Hey, who are those kids? 

Dude, they're gonna kill Kenny!

Ow. Quit it!

When I say "go," you slam your electric wheelchair into high gear. Okay, Timmy?

You could do Cartman's voice, can't you?

So you're gonna help us?

Cartman released the PS4s Cartman. They're being reviewed. People are liking them.

I know that I'll have to testify, that I'll have to... relive what I saw that day.  But I can't let Spielberg and Lucas get away with it. Not this time. Even if I have to do it alone.

But Dad, this is all the never-before-seen footage.

Well, you have to help him, just like I have to help my dad.

It was like having the life sucked out of you. That' all it is, sliding down a cable. Maybe without a tour group it'd be ...kind of fun. Maybe. But, this was just... a complete disaster.

I was the one. I was too afraid to say anything, but I can't let Kenny be sock-bathed for it.

Okay, that's enough.  Everybody! Cartman is just pulling one of his stupid tricks on everyone, because he's trying to get out of a deal he made!

I don't know.

Then I guess... I'm a dumbass. 

Cartman, just stay out of it.

Yeah. See, we got you to fight just 'cause we wanted to see who was the toughest. We made up all that stuff we said to get you guys mad at each other. 

Dude!

Ah... Oh Butters,  it'll be all right. Listen, we've all learned that people look for meaning in books. And sometimes, even if it isn't there, they'll try and invent their own meaning.

Yeah, they abduct people and they mutilate cows.

It's a really dry cold; that's the problem. It- the cold air makes me wheeze.

This is ridiculous! Just because they say it on TV it's alright.

Kenny's!

Run for it! 

Dude, totally. With Kenny's Magic skills, we could probably kick serious ass!

How do we make three hundred thousand dollars doing that?

You bastards!

Yeah, sweet! Maybe we can get a reward for the frozen guy!

What? How the hell do I only have 37 friends?

Out! 

We just... went on a balloon ride.

Come on, Cartman! You haven't liked anybody else!

Yeah, fatass, we're gonna dig up-  Dig up Kyle's dead grandma??

No way.

So what?

Yeah, they look like cheap rip-offs.

What is this??

This would have never happened if you would have let Kenny be a princess in the first place!

Hrrugh! 

Kenny had a will?

Tweek's gonna fight Craig!

No dude, get away!

You were, you were right?

It's a duck. 

Oh my God, what if I'm not real?

What?

No. I cross-referenced his YouTube profile with MySpace, and according to his blog, he's an old-school Communist. So what's he doing at every Clinton rally?

We just wanna warn you: Eric Cartman, the fourth grader, is goin' tuh try and trick you somehow into getting your wiener bitten off by a pony who lives at Denkins' ranch.

Eh I, I don't know what else to paint.

They're just drunk, Cartman! As soon as they sober up, they'll stop.

No, Ike! Ma, Ike keeps taking off his Squirt uniform!

Wow, there's a lot of profiles here. Kyle Broflovski's amazed Stan has so many Facebook friends. Hey, Kyle Broflovski's amazed Isiah is also a Facebook friend of Stan's.

Then why didn't you tell us?!

"So this is how America works. We have gods and clods. My dad says America needs both rich and poor to survive, but I have a better idea."

Stan, people in Beaverton are still trapped on their roofs. Nobody's helping them because they think they can't go outside.

We couldn't get trapped here forever, Cartman. We'd die after a couple of days. 

Guys, can I talk to you?

We're sorry, Mayor.

Errh!

What the hell is that?

Hey, you scrawny-eyed shithead, what the fuck is wrong with you?! You must be some kind of fucking asshole to be able to ignore a crying child!

See?! I just saw your lips move!

It's my little brother. He's really changing and I feel like-

Yeah, we got it.

Dude. I don't think I wanna be a part of this anymore.

Are you happy now?!

I think we can piece this case together now.

Weirdo. 

All we wanna know is, who has our Okama GameSphere?

Well, ah I mean, we have to accept that we have a problem, and put the blame completely on ourselves. I mean, maybe this isn't really even a disease. 

Yeah. Did you make out with him, too?

And this kid is watching Cartman commenting on people commenting on Dragon Age.

Okay, dude, it's 3:30. 

Hang on! Wait! 

You didn't see a leprechaun, fatass! If you could prove it, I had to suck your balls, but if you couldn't, you had to pay me ten dollars! Pay up!

Hey guys. Guys! Hold up.  Hey uhm, you're kind of friends with that Nichole girl, right?

I'll give you five bucks to eat your puke.

I can't. Just leave me behind.

Go America.  Go Broncos. 

Yeah, dude.

Huh?

I can see its head!

We can't let those sixth graders get their hands on this videotape.

You dirty son of a bitch, you never told us that we had to win-

And Stan for being in love with Wendy.

So, tobacco helped to build America.

Yeah, it's pretty cool.

Thanks, dude.

Hi Superman.

Nono Dad, please. I just got Call Of Duty: Advanced Warfare. Me and Ike are going to play it together.

Cartman! Wait!

Kathie Lee is coming to South Park?

What are all you guys doing here?

Who's that?

Oh yeah. Tom Cruise does have Seaman on his back.

Well, do you also do other surgeries like that?

Rebecca. You...

Oh no. Nohoho no. Cartman, don;t you do this! The Middle East is finally at peace!

It's a game, dude. It's really fun.

I knew it! It wasn't because I gave that guy twenty dollars! The homeless all came from here!

Because they're a bunch of assholes.

You got your what?

Who are you?

Ike, you can't come to school with me. 

You have got to be kidding me!

Well, he is. It turns out that the bookmobile driver here was the one making love to chickens.

No, I don't think so.

You bastard!

Then, you'll help us?

Well, that whole experience sure did suck.

Sir, we would love to sign your wife.

Three months?! But the pay-per-view is tomorrow!

Yeah, you can't get it if you don't breathe.

Yeah.  And that means that McGyver is a real person too.

Yeah, but that sucks, to get your butt kicked by a girl, Stan.

Yeah, check this one out. Ready, Ike? Kick the baby!

Okay, Stan, you've been an asshole to me all week! What is up?!

Aaaaa! There's a dude here! 

Hey, Cartman, do you think God's getting mad at you for not making $10 million? 

Owatta Beikoku! 

We have great news! Our friend has lost forty pounds eating your City Wok food. Here's the before and after photos.

with dreidel I shall play.

Oh who pees in the shower?

You're having nightmares about the ending to World War Z again?

Dude, killing everyone isn't funny!

Fine!

Oh, this is so cool.

Heheh, we could make you say whatever we wanted.

Why?!

I don't care if I signed an agreement!

Chef, this place isn't you!

Huh?

Well come on! We gotta tell you what happened. I'm sure glad it's over with. 

What?  CARTMAN! 

The liposuction is a process of siphoning out the excess fat. 

No way dude. I'm gonna win the costume contest with this sweet Chewbacca costume.

Wow! 

Yeah, that'd be faster.

He was with us at dinner. Wait. Was he with us at dinner?

We don't wanna play dodgeball. It hurts.

AAGGGGGHHHH!!

Do you see anything?

Oh cool.

Oh. Uh, can't right now, but maybe another time. See ya! 

We don't mind.

I swore to never fight again.

Then why did you send us the goat?

Mr. Hankey! Sshhhh! I'll get in trouble.

Butters!

All right. Thanks for your help, dudes.  Well, we did it, guys. It wasn't easy, but... we did a really amazing thing.

Let's hear it, Cartman!

Oh, yeah.

Yeah, stupid!

I...

Ih-it'll be okay.

Do you think we did a good thing, Stan?  I mean, no one even seemed to notice.

But we've been playing for eight hours. We can't think of anything else to do.

Right.

You measured everyone's wiener except for yours.

No way dude!

Who?

Then I can give it to my dad. 

Why do you care?

What's it say?

Bad.

Why do I have HIV?!

I know.

You bastard!

Why the hell would you want three copies of the same movie?

Hey, that might work. But it can't be a party for us.

What the hell for?!

Cartman, you're such a fat ass that when you walk down the street people go "God damn it, that's a big fat ass!"

Come on elephant, keep drinking.

IT WASN'T MY IDEA, IT WAS YOURS! YOU KILLED KENNY, YOU BASTARD!

I was in the bathroom-

...And in conclusion, the Latino community has provided America, and indeed, the entire world with innovations that we would be lost without. And that is my presentation on the role of Hispanics in American technology. Thank you. 

Uuuh. Well, the truth is, we didn't write that paper last time. 

Well, my dad is, too.

Grounded? For what?

Kenny was never gonna get his singing right anyway.

They never grow old because they die before they're 30!

But... we were so close... I'm sorry, Willzy-x. We tried.

Well, you might have made it, but we're the ones who are taking care of it now. You have your own egg to look out for!

Butters! Hey Butters!

So get off your fucking scooters and pick them up!

You bastards!

We're making the news more appealing to students.

Oolala 

It's not a game, you derelict! And this isn't Scotch! It's apple juice! 

I-I don't know.

Can't... glue... any... more. 

Casting...there's an 8-second cast time.

Hello?

Don't try and stop me, Stan! This is what my grandma wants!

What would we use a marble sack for?

No!

...Kenny, will you tell Cartman to shut up?

Ike, can I talk to you? 

Couple of days?  But Terrance is going to have his human clone by tomorrow.

I am not!

We still have an hour before the costume contest, so let's hit the house on the uh-

Eh-heh. L-look, if you want an explanation, you you'd better go to Kenny's house.

What are you talking about, dude?! I fell down that abyss and there it was!

No Ike! They're playing the trailer to the new Terrance & Phillip movie during the show, and we have to watch it! 

I'm gonna buy a Walkman with my half.

Ow, my nose! You broke my nose!

What??

Dude. 

We told you they were real Cartman. Sorry to hear about your ass.

But you run the Wall-Mart.

Well, now we know.

Yes you can!

AAAHHH! 

Wait we're working on it.

But instead, we should all be treated the same, with the same laws and the same punishments for the same crimes . For in that way Cartman can be freed from prison, and we  will have a chance to win the sledding race on Thursday.

We're not kids. We're full-grown men with dwarfism! How dare you assume that all midgets are children! We demand an apology!

Dude, what did you do?

I don't know!

Dude! Just take them off!

She did, but now they're saying we have to start going back to school anyways. It's totally gay.

Camp?

Why would they play such a cruel joke on us?

Dude, did you get your period yet?

Carman, will you shut up? I'm trying to find out what's going on.

What did they say??

I came here to talk about you!

But it's okay, Stan, because I finally figured it out. You see, if someone like Cartman can get a million dollars and his own theme park, then there is no God. There's no God, dude.

Come on, dude, somebody needs to wipe that fuckin' smirk off his face!

I thought it was "plane-tarium."

I'm sorry. I gotta go home. 

Really? Great! I don't have to worry about that anymore. 

Butters has that at his house?

Well-. Huwhat is it, Mr. Hankey?

You guys, we have to hurry!

Change our name?

Ooh, who the hell cares? He's not even my responsibility.

Oh n-no, I'm not really friends with him.

Hello? Will you just give this guy something, please?!

No-o-o-o-o!

-slashed the bus tires in Arkansas! I said so! I told you the minute that I-  -and I told you that-

Arh!

It's what we do in Jew Scouts. Usually we just sit around and make stuff. But tonight, because there's a meteor shower, we're gonna do some big thing out in the woods. It's gonna suck ass, I'm sure.

Dusty the dirtball

Stan, don't you think this has gone far enough? Is it really that big a deal?  Yeah, just vote. For Giant Douche.

No. No!! 

No problem, Funnybot.

We can't. Kenny just checked. There's a wall of people like seven miles thick behind us.

Huh?

Wait, we're sex addicts? Uh-are you sure?

Hello?

So we've gotta find another way out of here.

Oh, yeah!

Okay, forget it. We'll wait our turn.

You want Tammy to give you a B.J.?

Okay. Okay, the shot is finally set up. Now shoot the O mouth for two frames. 

Heheheh, buns.

Boy, it looks like you're not welcome anywhere elephant.  See ya. 

The digital sports watch is here.

...I don't know.

I guess so.

Cartman? Cartman saved the day?

And all the people we tell.

Yeah, he wanted adventure! Not a bunch of ridiculous bullcrap! Right Chef?  Chef?

Thanks a lot for the ride.

You need to stop recommending that app to people!

Don't call my mom a bitch, Cartman!

What? Oh my God.

Mom, Dad, what exactly are this party for?

You gotta come to Kenny's house with us.

Cartman, you hike me the ball, then somebody run, and I'll throw it at something. Ready?!

And then we ran out of the Kum & Go and these guys, th-they took our friend.

What is Native American comedy, anyway?

Well, I'm sure it was him.

Token.  Clyde.  Craig  Timmy

Uh wu we weren't sleeping, Mr. Garrison.

Don't do it, Officer Barbrady!

How?!

All right, all right. 

I've been thinking, Wendy. This whole outcome is pretty strange.

No way, dude! It sucked ass! They don't even have cable!

Magic Johnson?

Come on, Ike, hurry up!  Where is the next train going?

I have an idea.  I don't like it, but I think it's the only choice we have.

So... why would one come to America to warn us about a terrorist attack.

Dude, you don't want your first kiss to be something you paid for. It's supposed to be special.

You guys! I got my period, too!

What the hell are you singing, Cartman?

We don't have time for that, dude! We just have to ditch them! Now!

Two hundred dollars?

I don't want to ask Mr. Hat, I'm asking you!

This is so retarded, Cartman. You've got everyone believing your stupid story.

It's not my fault.

The only thing of yours that's larger in size is your big fat ass!

I know. It's probably gonna be the biggest night of our lives!

I don't know what we're going to do? It's been like four hours and people still won't talk to us.

Don't let him touch you! You die if he touches you!

Look, we could we could probably get Terrance, but he'll be performing with this other guy.

Who makes this crap?

Nah, let him make a complete ass out of himself for a little while longer. 

Yeah. Check it out.  Ready Ike? Kick the baby!

Yeah, I think so.

You TP'ed a house last week, Cartman?

Fifty-five daura.

Dude, this whole building is going to collapse!

Alright dude, we were going to the movies.

You're such a fatass, Cartman!

I can't wait to see him!  He's gonna be so glad we came!

We did it! You see, Cartman? You won us the Terrance and Phillip dolls!

Kick ass, dude! Cartman's mom throws the best birthday parties ever.

You son of a bitch! Aaargh!

Whoa whoa, I'm not going anywhere.

Yeah, this all happened the day after he went to that concert!

God-damnit Cartman!

Oh, come on!!

No, Ike, go home.

Good for you, Charlie!

Come on! Let's go make fun of him!

Alright, fine! Let's just get this stupid report over with!

No, the XBox's are gonna be better.

Ohh, dude!

Aawwww! Hey Dad. Is it true that you and Kenny's dad used to be best friends when you were young?

Yeah, come on! 

Well, maybe we will, maybe we won't.

Hunh. That was pretty weird.

Ow! What the hell was that for?!

Face it Stan! Nobody's coming for us! 

Stan, you can't keep doing this to yourself. You have to go live.

Yeah. Here you go. 

Cool!

Hey Stan. 

...And then it got attacked by terrorists?

Thirteen point seven inches?

What did you say?

What do ya mean?

How come the visitors aren't coming for him?

Well, I just figured you'd vote for my guy! Who's fuckin' friend are you?!  Puffy!

Because, dude, we're playing detectives! Detectives don't just go tell on people.

Ahahah!

"And as the voluminous corporate automaton bulldozes its way through bantam America...

I can't wait until the teacher yells at us this time, and we all tell her to suck our balls!

She's upstairs.

Whoa.

But we actually are busy. Tonight's the big fight.

You want a fight? Well, that's fine with me!

I didn't wanna have to do this.  but if you don't tell us, I'm gonna tell your dad you helped get the wrong person elected President!

They knew that staying at Kenny's house would get us sick, and they made us do it anyway.

I am not, not, d-rinking pee!

Stan?  Stan, where are you going?

Well, I turned off all my Apple stuff. They can't locate you if you don't have your stuff on, right? 

Hey dude, how'd it-? 

Probably.

That's the chemical equation for gold?

Nothing. Um , my period is really uuuh...  Uuuh, my period is going swimmingly.

I'm not really happy.

Can we go now, please?!

Yeah! 

What's he doing at his teacher's house?

Yeah, it's tough. But it's times like these that... you see what your band is made of. We've gotta fight through the rough times like Journey!

(I can't take it! I want out right now!)

..What the-?

Oh no. Cartman, no!

No, you're the minority!

No you didn't, asshole! What you did was totally stupid and racist! And you only did it to screw me over!

Nothing, watching the election results.

No, ah, I'm an arcane fire mage.

Shut up and study!

Dude, I don't understand hunting at all.

Duh.

You think?

Gut they're the ones risking injury.

We can't. We're saving our money for the balls in Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth game.

Come out here and talk to me face to face! Open this door!

Towelie is cool, but he gets stoned all the time. You can't really rely on him for anything.

So I guess this means we get to keep our weapons.

Wow, level nine already? Dude, you kick ass in "Heaven versus Hell."

Why did they search us? That marijawana never even made it to us.

...Dude, you're supposed to vote for Giant Douche.

Wait, Stan, there he goes.

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! 

What was what?

No, you're fat to begin with, chubby! Now you're Texan too!

Blow it out your ass, Cartman! 

Yeah, dude! Kenny just died eight hours ago from that monster! How could he have died back then, too?

I'll do everything I can.

I know your family's poor, but you can't just eat an entire bowl of mints for dinner.

Yeah! Let's see how they like it!

Don't be sad, Ike. Just be happy that you live in a country where people get to elect a president at all.  Hello?

Stop him, Kenny! 

Oh God, it's true.

Oh it's, it's so sad.

Aw, dude! You can still kinda see the spleen!  How much, Kenny?

Get the fuck out of here!

Well, we helped.

All right!!

Where have you been, dude?

Finally.  It's over.

Ask Jeeves? Nobody uses Ask Jeeves! Just Google-search it!

Excuse me. Eric Cartman has HIV?

No, uh-I knew it! I knew it. I was just testing you guys. You just wait till I get to that Chinpokomon camp! I'm gonna be the toughest master of them all! So we'll see you there, a-ight? 

Where?

Aw come on now, people! 

Wow, that was pretty good.

Don't belittle my people, you fucking fatass! 

Okay, fine, Butters. But if you're gonna hang out with us, you have to play like Lord of the Rings. 

You yourself led the campaign against the colorization of films. You understand why films shouldn't be changed.

God damn you!

Know what, Ma?

No, it doesn't!

...star-starting to become alienated from some of your friends.

Dude, what does that mean?

Ike, don't do it! There's still so much to live for!  I know you really wanted McCain to win but, but it's going to be okay.  No, that's not true, Ike. The economy could easily stabilize with Obama's plan.  Ike, don't jump! You could really hurt your ankle or something.  Really Ike, that's like five feet off the ground. Don't do it.

Okay. Ready? One, two, three, not it!

...Excuse me, I have to step out for a minute. 

And if I had just one wish, just one wish in the whole world,
If I had one wish it'd be for Cuba to change.
Because I think that all the Cubans are in pain
All the joy in the world, from sea to shining sea
Doesn't mean a thing if Cubans aren't free
I just can't be very happy, that's certain
Not as long as your Cubans are hurtin' 
Oh, won't you search your soul and find a way to change your mind?
That is my one and only wish.

No way.

Dude!

Who's Middle Park?

He is under alien control. That thing in his butt is linked up to the visitors!

Ah I'm sorry, but I don't really care. I just want to know what medication my little has been getting from you, and why?!

Yes. Yes, I do, Dad. Now let me tell you how it works in the real world. In the real world, I can either get a Chinpokomon, or I can be the only kid without one, which singles me out, and causes the other kids to make fun of me and kick my ass.

Dude, dressing up like Hitler is not badass!

Aren't those the queermos on the Disney Channel?

Do it! Do it!

Princess Kenny, I believe it's time we returned the Wizard's hospitality! 

That's a retarded idea that won't work. Why are you really doing this?

Dad.  Dad, Ike and I have been talking, and well, we feel that your new car is changing you.

Cartman, are you still trying to become a lesbian?!

Grab him! 

We were stuck. We were completely stuck. 

Then I guess I'll see you on Black Friday.

Mom! Dad! We rode on Santa's sleigh!

Oh, okay.

Come on, Nurse Token. We're gonna play football, you puss.

So, plug it in.

See, when you start invading people's privacy, eh thinking it's harmless to put up pictures of them they didn't want up - Kenny! - you start a domino effect that eventually screws everything up for everybody!

I can't wait to get out of school and get our Teiko sports watch.

Why? What's it sound like?

I don't need Ike listening to you comment on anything!

But everybody watches Terrance & Phillip.

Oh, my God.  Hi, ...Grandma.

It happens to be called poutine in Montreal! 

Maybe we are.

Native Americans. 

An ailnay ilefay.

Can someone help us? My little brother fell out of a window. 

So? You're a smartass!

Go on, Ike.

Kick it!

No.

Wait. That's it. Atonement. Of course.  I know what I have to do now. Thank you, Father. 

Good thing we made those changes to the seating.

Hoh, Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,

That was the dumbest ride I've ever seen!

In three hours.

All right, look, there's gotta be other Third-World countries with space programs. We've gotta split up and find someplace cheaper, that's all.

...You put Kenny's picture on a milk carton??

Hoh, geez. 

Come on guys, we gotta go! 

I'm sorry, can I come back in just a little bit?

Yeah? Okay, and you checked with Kenny and Token? He's not just staying at their houses?

Butters, what's happened to you?

Boy, do we ever.

Who are you?

That isn't my idea! I saw a bus in a garage a couple of blocks back! We need to modify it!

It's still stupid and now I paid 49 cents for it!

You bastards. 

Dude! Bulldozers rule!

Dude, I can't believe we are dealing with this Muhammad thing again.

Where are you going?  Ike, where are you going?

Yeah.  HEY, WHEN ARE WE GONNA GET TO SOME ACTION, HUH?

Yeah, all the constellations look alike.

So wait, wait: Stan took a dump in the urinal and he contacted the conspiracy Web site? But the conspiracy site was run by the government?

Sweet! Let's go!

Wow!

An online chat party for all his friends... Dude, I should get over there!

Yeah, he sure is.

Oh, thank you! I was so eagerly awaiting your approval of my abilities! 

Of course, the sewer! That must be where he is. Come on!  Come on!

The aliens are chasing us! 

Wow, are you gonna do it?

Ziplining was your idea, you fatass!

Aw, stop it, Cartman! Your hand hand doesn't need to breathe!

Awwww!

Hey! Don't try to pass it back on me, fatass!

HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!

Mister, you can't do this to us!

I can't, Mom. We're working on our school project.

You hate Wall-Mart, too? 

Do you guys know anything about corporations?

There it is again! 

Aw man, here we go again! Use the Jew as a scapegoat.

Yeah.

It was Cartman having Butters apologize for him.

What?

How was what?

What's the Yanogapa?

Watch out! Here I come!

This... is insane. 

Wendy, nothing's gonna happen to the egg. You can have it when the week is over and I have my grade.  Freakin' weirdos, man.

Twenty dollars.

But that sucks. I don't want something to have that much power over me.

We can't get out! The flames are too big!

But dude, you're making stuff up.

It always has been. See? This is nice. 

You bastards! 

All right!  Ow. Hm. 

Dude, it's Terrance & Phillip.

Well Token was a definite winner for talent show. But then we decided to take everyone to a baseball game, to see how we got along there.

I thought you didn't care about Wendy anymore.

But our teacher, Mr. Garrison? He just had his penis made into a vagina. How come?

We can't deal with you saying "hella" anymore, Cartman! You're going to the other universe! 

You dick!

They did it! They got it working! 

Over here!

That sounds great!

I said Ike's on fire!

Wow! I had already forgotten how great third grade was.

What do you want?!

Stan! Dude, is that you?

God, that was not cool at all, dude!

Funny.

Come on guys! We gotta go tell Chef he's in love with a succubus.

Butters, we are sick! Don't you get it?! We're gonna end up just like Kenny!

Ah, heck, Mr. Visitors, I'm just a kid all alone in this crazy world, but if you could find it in your hearts or whatever you have, to give my brother back to me, it sure would make my life brighter again.

We know he's dead. We mean, where is his body??

How many iPod Nanos is friendship worth? I guess, one.

He can't do crap!

Yeah. She is.

Dad, let's just go!

He beat us. Because all this time we've been so caught up with how to protect our music that we forgot to just play.

They're not gonna show that stupid-ass Godzilla movie again, are they?

Not like that!

The new girl liked me, and so you lied to her!

Boy, that kid's having a hard time adjusting to public school.

On the sled, fatass!

Yeah! That's Texas, butthole!

What's "bad touch"?

Me.

Listen, guys, I appreciate you wanting me around, but, the fact of the matter is, well, yeh, you guys are just kind of douche bags.

What?!

Just stop it! That's enough! You aren't reading another sentence of your stupid story!

Look, we're from Colorado! We, we grew up in the United States.

'Kay, so now just click on the little soil button...  and then maybe put a sign up to comment on my farm...  Okay, now I can read the sign you put up...

It looks like a note.

We can't just leave!

Aw, dude. 

Yeah, they want everyone to stick around and watch more of this retarded show.

Abraham Lincoln has been dead for two hundred years!

Cartman, they killed Kenny!

What?!

Yeah, you can have a drink of water. The dispenser's over there. 

Oh yeah, time travel.

Yeah.

It just ran by here a second ago. 

All that work!

We're all here today because Chef has been such an important part of our lives. A lot of us don't agree with the choices Chef has made in the past few days.  Some of us... feel hurt... and confused that he seemed to turn his back on us.  But we can't let the events of the last week take away the memories of how much Chef made us smile.  I'm gonna remember Chef as the jolly old guy who always broke into song.  I'm gonna remember Chef... as the guy who gave us advice to live by.  So you see, we shouldn't be mad at Chef for leaving us. We should be mad at that little fruity club for scrambling his brains.

Dude, he needs us right now.

Whoa. 

You bastard!

Oh, no thanks. We don't do that stuff.

You bastard! 

It doesn't even look like they're open. 

We're dead.

Well, then you gotta ride it out, Butters.

Did so! Did so!

I'm going to try to save Stan and Butters from getting nuked!

Aw man, at least the real Jesus didn't weigh 400 pounds!

Yeah, this church kicks a-- Eh... I-it kicks!

Shut up, fatass!!

Yeah, take that!

You wanna kill me?! Fine!  I can't live like this anymore! Go ahead! Do it! 

Nothing happened! There's nothing I can do! 

You guuuys!

Oh that's a good idea. 

Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,

with dreidel I shall play.

You use IntelliLink?? Oh my God! Will you check his records please?

We have to confess that we were the ones that-

Is here. To see me.

You guys, we can't give up on our dreams now! As soon as this strike ends, we're gonna be the biggest band ever!

That's because there is no goo, Mr. Cruise. You see, I learned something today. Throughout this whole ordeal, we've all wanted to show things that we weren't allowed to show. But it wasn't because of some magic goo. It was because of the magical power of threatening people with violence. That's obviously the only true power. If there's anything we've all learned, it's that terrorizing people works.

Awwgh! Hey dude, we don't even have enough weight to move.

So we're not TP'ing a house with kids inside it!

We are raising money so that Chef can hire Johnnie Cochran to sue you!

What?

Happy Chanukah, Mom. 

That was a waste of money, Cartman!

All right! Things just might work out!

Ladies and gentlemen, my best friend, Mr. Hankey, is getting sick because South Park has become overcrowded with people who eat health food.

You just squat, stupid! 

The whale's name is Willzy-x, and he told us he's dying on our planet. We've come up wth a plan, but we're gonna need all of your help to make it work.

Guys! You guys!  Listen: Cartman has tens of thousands of voter ballots hidden somewhere. He's changed the outcome of the election!

Are you saying that Ike has been given regular doses of hormones because of an IntelliLink screwup?!

What was that? 

You are?

Wookies don't live on Endor!

I'm not hearing that.

Please, just, just leave it alone, Stan. Everything is as it has to be.

Well, Tweek's okay, but he's certainly no Kenny! 

Www-what do you mean?

So can you do it?

What manatees??!! 

Wow. Barbrady sure is acting weird.

What?

Well?

Ah, I don't know, it just feels like... there's got to be something else going on here.

I still say this is a bad idea.

Nothing. But the guys said if I don't confess my sins and eat crackers, I'm gonna go to hell.

Eh, oh, alright. 

Well, I attend South Park Elementary, ah-and... w-one of the teachers is having sssex with a student.

Because, he kinda like looks like Steve Austin, the $6 million man

You can say that again.

No, but look: I just got this sweet Cyborg Bill doll.

Well, at least he's back to normal.

I could watch this for days. 

Dude, it just can't be better than ours. It just can't be.

"You know he can't think on his own, Kyle!" "Brush and floss, Kyle!" "Where has that finger been, Kyle?"

Huh? 

This isn't paradise and you know it! The people here are starving and dying! The whole world has used Somalia as a dumping ground for toxic waste. Even the fish here are radioactive!  Cartman, just give me my brother  and let us get out of here!

Uh, hi. Is, uh, is Rebecca home?

We need you, Chef.

What?

Well, everyone in the world thinks you are. See ya. 

Wait! 

Revamp how? The rules are that the fourth grade class has to perform the Helen Keller Story.

Oh my God! They cloned a foot. 

No. I found this frozen guy in the woods today.

I'm sorry, Kip, but I really can't be your friend anymore. It was a great ride, but I must say goodbye. This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do, but ending a friendship... is never easy. 

Dude, this is unbearable.

Ike, that is enough! If you're interested in Call of Duty, go play it downstairs in the living room!

(You're fine!)

Okay, hang on a second I-

Oh, thanks! 

...No.

And so, red hair, light skin, and freckles are all passed down genetically. A child's red hair is not determined by the lack of a soul,  but by the melanins which control the pigment in all of our skins. Thank you. 

Dude, I don't wanna play Detective anymore.

...Mr. Hankey! Hoh, we were so worried! I was waiting up for you and you didn't come, so I thought that-

Dude, what the hell's wrong with you?!

Ooogh. Dude, the thing is, we're not the ones that made them crack babies. That's their moms' goddamned fault!

Shut the fuck up!  What?

Candy bars?

It looks like a UFO.

No! Maybe we all just need a little image change, you know? Like a makeover.

You haven't done anything yet!

That should just about do it.

Oh, you can pretend all you want! You're not fooling anybody!

Not one adult left?

Okay, so now you'll help us take care of Trent Boyett?

What are you doing here? 

Stop dude! You're gonna scramble his brain!

Yeah! We've gotta raise people's awareness!

Jimmy, you're got to explain to the Germans that this is your fault, not ours!

Oh wait. Cartman.

Re- really?

We told you, dude. 

Look, Cartman, I don't know what's gotten into you, but... I I think it's pretty amazing. And I think it's real. You have to understand why I didn't believe you before.

You can't sit with us, new kid. Go find another table! 

Yeah.

What are you talking about, fatass?

Hm, I wasn't really going for "gay," I was more going for "wholesome."

with dreidel I shall play.

Don't give him anything!

Wuh what doesn't follow?

Kyle.

We're not fucking you, they're fucking Stan's grandpa!

Well, okay.

I'm here to bust out Steve.

Hey, who are you?

Well, what's the point? Jimmy always wins with his stand-up comedy.

Why do you always have to hit stuff with a stick?!

Just do it again, Cartman, and don't make it talk! 

This looks pretty good.

You're not an awesome teacher!

Cartman!

You bastard! 

Go on and go home, you fat chicken!

No, Timmy, wait!

You're not supposed to rock, you're supposed to keep the beat!

All right! MapQuest the address!

Just get the hell out of here, Cartman! You're not serious and you're a detriment to the band!

Well, what about those two college guys next door to me? They're always doing science experiments in their basement.

Butters! When did you call Oculus Rift Customer Service?!

Cartman, that's the dumbest thing you've ever said - this week!

It's just a stupid pig.

Wow. That's pretty cool.

Aren't they ever gonna wake up?

Yeah, maybe starting a detective club isn't such a bright idea.

Peter Pan, too??

I'm not sucking your balls; that's imaginary!

You fat sun of a bitch!

Our little man is growing up, Stan. He's growing up.

Yeah. 

You can't be standing there, Cartman.

This itches! Give me some of that calamine lotion, Cartman.

Coach! Coach, I'm all better. I'm ready to play.

Wendy, I just wanna get an A, okay? Let's not make this any more confusing than it already is. &lt;&gt;

Why bad?

"Free hat?"

There. Did you see? He just flipped you off.

We can't fight them, Cartman.

What?

Dude, I can't deal with Wall-Mart right now. My parents had me there for three hours last night. 

I can see clearly now, the rain is goneI can see all obstacles in my way-

Me too.

You, you paid your friends tuh...  not make fun of me?

If we can go in, and get the GameSphere in 30 minutes, we could still be back at your house playing video games by midnight!

Our parents won't let us have weapons, dude. 

I don't think so.

Cool! We'll see what we can find, ma'am.

I'm a Vulcan!

It's not working here?

What?  What??

Llook, I know I'm not the best-looking guy in town, but I I didn't think I was the very ugliest.

Dude! I had the same dream! We jumped on a dragon's back and, and Butters got left behind!

What the? Where are, where are we?

I'm going to put it in my room, where Cartman can't find it.

No no, he's right! We've gotta make it for someone in need so that people have to go.

Sir, we're doing everything we can.

I know who.

Mr. Garrison, I'm the only one here. Everyone else has chicken herpes.

You guys go tell Butters to start making the cutoouts. I'm gonna go tell Mr. Hankey the good news!

Ah!

Did Cartman just say "shitballs" to the principal?

It's just that... I really need this A, Stan. And Bebe did say you almost broke your last egg.

Dude, what do you mean "We don't have a coach."?

That was sweet, Bebe.  Now, if you just hold the rock like this, you-

Dow... 

So, he's gonna get it, right?

I know, hunh? Put your mouth against the glass like this.  Waaaaah! 

This is all a bunch of crap!

Butters is staying over tonight?

Yeah, it was the craziest thing. I hid myself on a plane to Antarctica. Oh, it was so dry down there.

No, dude, if something happens to him, my parents are gonna blame me.

You bastards!

How come the visitors aren't coming for him.

Yeah! And fried chicken! 

Hey Cartman.  I care a lot about him, too. 

No! Ike, don't do it!

Throw the ball, you stupid frog!  God-damn, maybe if you didn't eat all those croissants,  you'd be able to-- Ow! 

Yeah, sweet.

Yeah. Too bad you're such a dumbass in history, or you would have known that!

Ruuun! 

Fine.

Hey! Let's pour them in the teacher's coffee tomorrow morning.

I'm sorry. I'm. I'm really. Cartman, I f-I feel really bad for you. Honestly.

Here! Here! Look at this. It says "The succubus enchants its victim with an eerie melody. This is the Succubi power. Only playing this melody backwards can vanquish the succubus power."

You, I gu-I guess you're kinda right.

It was a fake!

I can't say "ookie mouth" and have Kenny spit down my throat at the same time. It's impossible. 

Why do you have a video camera?

I know, but—why do they have to take it out on us? Why do we have to wait around for them to come back?

Hey, excuse me, but we need some help.

Yeah, dude. Its Guitar Hero.

That doesn't count, fatass!

But it's the truth!

Shut up, Cartman! You can't scare anybody!

She's really taking this grade seriously, Stan. I'm gonna come over so that we can take our egg to school together, all right?

Huh?

Dude, thank God for stupid people 

Dude, because of the electoral college these votes in swing states can really matter.

Yeah. And now you can take that stupid beard off! 

What?!

No.

Dude, there's a guy with a gun here!

What's he doing?

We were happy playing Laundromat Owners.

Where the hell is it??

It was seriously about the greatest night of our lives.

Oh. Okay. Thanks.

Here.  We made ten million theoretical dollars. It's all for you. 

He doesn't even let me near him!

I'm just not sure this is the name people are gonna give money to.

I just had a couple more questions about-

Cartman! What kind of stupid-ass question is that?! Of course it was fun!

Go. 

That's it!  I don't care about the fate of the world! Screw it!

No, what marches in, crawls up your leg and bites the inside of your ass?

Jeez, he's worse than I thought.

And do I have to shovel the whole driveway, or just the side the car is on?

Dude, they've been doing that for a long time.

Alright, Ms. Crabtree. Is it comf'table enough?

You threw it away, Cartman!

Dumbass, if there's sixty percent of them to forty percent of us, then who's the minority?!

Aw it's horrible! 

What?

Eewww! 

Sick, dude! 

We think that you might have could it by helping make "shit" an everyday word. 

...God-damnit, here!  Alright, Timmy, let's go! 

Maybe it's better you don't know who your father is, Cartman.

There's no such thing as Mr. Hankey.

Righ!  Okay, good.

All right, let's go.

Let's go, dude. We're ready.

Then I was right. Job has all his children killed, and Michael Bay gets to keep making movies. There isn't a God.

Agh! Look, dude, we're on level 24, about to cross into the Caverns of Madness!

He did not!

I'm not being in any  faggy boy band!

Draw two card, fatass.

Not really.

What the hell is going on?  Hello?  Excuse me, I need to get to Los Angeles.  Hello?! 

I'm not a professor.

You are not going to go on national television and spew a bunch of hate speech about Jewish people! I won't let you do it, Cartman!

Aw dide, this is hopeless!

Stan! Stan, wake up!

Shouldn't we hide her better than that?

Cartman, what the hell are you doing?

Jesus, I can't do anything.  I'm just a fourth grader going against the entire government.  Uh, hello? Jesus?

Does so!

Yeah, that's weak!

I made you out of clay.

Dude...

One.  Two. Three! 

Please? I need you to come sit down for a second.  So... Here we all are. Mom, do you want to tell Dad something?  Mom?

What?! But she looks just like everybody else. Up yours, Tina Yothers! 

Do you?

You know I can't go there, Stan!

There's not gonna be any robot guards, retard! Just get Kenny! 

No. Tell me you didn't!

I'm trying! 

Arrggh! 

The new neighbors that moved in next to Stan's house. Me and Ike saw the mom get a parking ticket, and she called the parking cop "muff cabbage".

Why?! So I could be sitting in the hospital waiting to die, like Stan?!

Hello, Stan.

No, we gotta go. Sally Struthers is gonna give us a ride back to Earth.

I hate you, remember?  You wanna be partners, Jimmy?

Wow. Cool.

Can you believe it, Stan? I never thought global warming could happen so fast. I guess... I didn't listen.

It's okay, it's still the show.

"Fat tits." That's a good one.

Dude, leave me alone.

That's fine. 

You weren't playing fair, dude. Getting your dad to work part time at the mall wasn't fair.

You okay, bro?

AAAAH! 

Did you smoke some of your mom's crack?

How did your date with Ms. Ellen go?

Cartman!

Oh no.  You're not stinking up the entire boat! You're taking a crap off the side into the water!

Wwait, what?

Dude, we're gonna go sneak into Cartman's and change him back into a non-ginger!

"These, are the morning announcements." 

...You didn't save everyone, I did! You were just out harassing Muslims!

Dude, maybe we don't have to rip a tooth out of Kenny's mouth.

Yeah dude. 

What?

You love-

Communists?

Nobody hates rainbows.

I knew it! You didn't plan 9/11 and you really didn't shoot that guy!

Oh no! Dad's metrosexual too?

Nonono! We need to do this first.

Ike!  Wait! '

...Okay Cartman, what do you want this time?

Dammit!  Ike, if you wanna keep your penis, you have to get on this train.  Ready, Ike? Kick the baby!

Cartman, Cartman! I heard that Stan somehow found out about our plan!

Oh man! We are in serious trouble!

...Scotch?

We killed Kenny?

It's unbelievable, Stan. EA Sports just used us the entire time. We worked for nothing and EA made all the money. You know, I don't think we actually deserved getting screwed over but, but I guess making tons of money off of people who are making nothing is always gonna cause problems. I know, I know, right? We might've got screwed, but the really tragic thing is that those, those poor crack babies at the hospitals are just gonna be stuck there, with nowhere to go.  No way!  This is it!

So what?!

We didn't do our homework.

You just wanna lock me in there because you think I'm one of them.

Sick! I felt it on my face!

Well, I have this friend, see? And this friend belongs to a certain, Chosen People of Israel. And it... so happens that these chosen people killed your Lord.

What??

A big success?! You can't even get Tyler Perry to go back home!

Deformed how?

Hold on. I see.  Oh, Jeezus, this sled is going faaaast.

There's a lot of holes in the Theory of Evolution too; it doesn't mean it's wrong.

I'm not arguing about The Passion! He's being an asshole!

Hey! Maybe we should ask the girls what they learned in sex ed.

N-no way! Do it yourself.

We know how to fart, Mr. Mackey!

I got 'em! Four tickets, 68th row, to Terrance and Phillip! I waited in line since 3 this morning!

I don't think they're going to be able to get all of you in frame Cartman.

That's okay, we'd rather just go by ourselves.

No! You have to show Mohammad, Mr. President!

Hey, look you guys.

All right, let's eat Colonel! 

Dude, did Cartman just crap treasure?

A giant douche.

Why do they have to put this on TV?! 

This whole time your TV is in a house with nobody in it?!

Wait...

Alright, Cartman! What's so important you had to pull us away from lighting cow crap on fire?!

Dude, you had waffles for breakfast, huh?!

What?

No Ike! Shh!

But I thought we were supposed to care on Thanksgiving.

Aha, and I'll have the City Chicken.

We should use nails, dude.

Hey Jimmy. What's up?

Fatty Doo Doo?

No! Butters, stop! 

And that's it? That's the end?

You guys are sellouts.

Dude, you can't do this! How can we be the Avengers without Captain America?

But, you guys, I--

Okay. "Woo" mouths again?

No. And I don't want to. Look Stan, maybe we should fo- 

Jesus Christ!

Cartman? Cartman?? 

I am not sucking Cartman's balls!

The what?

Code 7! Bring in the firemen!

I think he said he wants to practice on a real bull.

He’s not dying, Cartman!

Yeah. Clearly Annie Nelson is the hottest girl at our school. Look at those eyes!

I'm so happy! 

Yummy yummy yummy I want Cartman's farts in my tummy.

Code 234

Nooohohohohohoho-

He purposely infected me with his HIV virus!

Hoh boy.  Sick!  Aggghhh! Fucking sickening! 

What??

What??

Yeah, I hope they protest TV shows forever.

You can't kill all three of us, Cartman!

Oh dude! Dude, this is the part I was talking about. Check out the bassline on this! 

Aaahh. Well-  AAAAH! 

He's gotta show up. He's just got to.

Gays can get married? What??

No. We can't, dude. We have to win the Terrance and Phillip dolls.

Yeah. 

I don't know.

Our whole weekend is shot.

Mom, Dad!  They're gonna kill her! They're going to in-. Wait, what are you doing here?

Dude, it's a dude! 

We have to get past them!

No! We're already halfway done.

Not in pee!

Wow, awesome. Um...

Better, thanks.

You bastard!

Yeah. They're tryin' to scare everybody 'cause they're gay wads.

Just go. Go without me.

The outside of the device seems to be covered in numerals. Inside are colors... which must open up to some sort of temporal time warp.

He said they're doing a Total Recall.

Yes we do! We have a sweet name.  I was wrong, Cartman. "Washington Redskins" is the perfect name. I think maybe I was jealous that I didn't come up with it.

What the hell are you doing?

Lots of people will when I tell them!

Corey Lanskin?

Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,

You bastards!

What is this, Cartman?

From who? We can't ask adults for help and there's nobody tougher than sixth graders.

That is not what happened! You totally started crying and quit the game!

Oh, you are so full of crap, Cartman! Metal spikes will not come out!

Yeah. We're having him resurrurected.

Huh?

Mom, Ike did it again. I don't know what's going on with him, but, it's like he hates me.

Yeah, dude!

But of course it matters, because you should be concerned there's blood in your underwear.  Do you understand this?

Will you shut up!

That's... really touching.

Alright, here it goes. Cartman, you aren't really here.

Yep! I love basketball. I wanna play for the Denver Nuggets one day.

Yeah. Thanks, dick!

Oh my God! What the hell are we gonna do for six hours?

I think Kenny likes it. 

They were wearing cowboy hats!  Did you see??  Did you see?? 

Hey! Hey, let me out of here! This is a mistake! I agreed by accident!

We all have Attention Deficit Disorder. So we all started taking Ritalin.

He is working for the Wall-Mart to stop us from succeeding!

Rats.

We could go to the city pool. They have a water slide

My butt hurts.

Man, I can't believe how much people want us to get our winning ticket back.

We're trapped in here!

What??

We understand you just sounded like a freakin' racist!

Hehe. Why the hell did you dress up like Raggedy Andy dude?

You are such a manipulative asshole, Cartman.

Dude, we can't do a presentation on underpants gnomes. Mr. Garrison will fail us because you're making it up.

That's right!

Baahir Hakeem.  Born in Chicago, eight years old, his favorite color is green... Car, Cartman, what is this all about?

Yeah. We're fine.

Where did that come from??

There's still time to tell the network president you're full of CRAP! 

We don't have a choice, dude. That guy killed our characters 14 times.

George Bush?

Hey dude, how's it going?

You should know, fatass.

What?

"Have mercy!"  Yeah ha ha!

Aah!

Yeah. Quick!

Hmm... This isn't going over so well.

Stop being a pouty little bitch 'cause you lost, Cartman!

So how'd your date with Ms. Ellen go?

What?

Then you take care of him.

Dude, we weren't playing anybody.

Cartman!

Ike, you'll always be my little brother, okay?

Look, I know it isn't exactly what we wanted, but maybe we can train it.

Well, we can still pre-tend like we know what it means.

Kenny! 

I know that I often have serious moral objections to the things that you do, but... this time I think you really need to reconsider, because if you do this, I believe you will go to hell. So I feel it is my responsibility, as your friend, to tell people what you're doing, and to put a stop to it!

Dude, I'm telling you. It's crazy. All my little brother wants to do is sit on YouTube watching this PewDiePie play video games. I swear, I don't understand kids these days.

Put him down, you stupid dog!

Dude! 

Nuh uh.

Mrrh.  Mr. Garrison?

Officer Barbrady, I wanna declare Shenanigans on this carnival operator.

Yeah, what kind of name is Pip anyway?!

Yes, whatever you want. 

But that doesn't mean it has to go off the air. You should like that show. Your sense of humor is just like Family Guy.

I know! But that doesn't matter any more! These kids don't wanna play the game, they just wanna watch people on YouTube play it. And you know why? Commentary.

Uh, hi. Our friend joined your club a while back, and now he wants to molest kids. 

Look, can you guys just get down to business so we can go find my little brother?

Mom? Dad? What's a sex-change operation?

Yes!!

I don't think my mom would want me doin' this.

Can you see anything? 

Hunh, I guess you're right.

Oh-- Noooo!

Got it. 

Nah, my mom packed me a kosher lunch.

Jesus, you may be right.

Wull yeah, but ah-I got my brother back.

Well, not really, except that Kenny keeps eating people's brains.

You're on!

What the hell is wrong with everybody?

What's that, dude?

They were all out of 'em dude!

Wait, what are you taking Stan's blood for?

It just... doesn't seem right.

And you don't see a problem with that?

Mr. Jefferson, your son can't get up.

But we could get killed!

I wanna be the tough one!

Dammit, Cartman, open up!

Well, our pig hasn't given birth yet, but she should anytime now.

Cartman, you okay??  You need help??

What did they do with all the fat? There must have been enough to last an Eskimo family months.

Hey, fatass. How's prison?

Aw, don't be such a baby!  You do it, Kenny.

We're not playing Dungeons and Dragons, assface!

Please Dad, I've been looking forward to this all week. Aaand it's me and Ike's bonding time. Really. This is good for our relationship.

Hey dudes.  Sorry I couldn't make it yesterday. What'd you guys do?

He gave me AIDS!

We're not going anywhere without Chef.

Oh no! They ruined my life! I get to kill them first!

Dude! You're still alive, Cartman?

No, he'll die!

Why are you doing this, Stan?

I'm gonna kill you, Cartman!

What the hell are you talking about, Cartman?!

Alright!

That's right!

Mom, there's sssomething I need to tttell you.

Just let it go, dude. You only had sixteen dollars and twelve cents. Count all your losses and move on. He's smarter than you.

Dad, I think Ike is starving to death. 

Well, Stan I have to harvest my crops before it's too late.

Yeah, but we didn't believe them.

Sup, Jason? 

Don't listen to him! You still have a chance to preserve your film! 

Wwwait. 

It isn't fair. Cartman's fatter than the goal.

Two Towers Video Store. I-in Conifer.

Hey you guys! Check out my sweet Chinpokomon doll!

Can we talk to your supervisor please?!

Hoh!  Anyways, you put a spin on it by holding it here and-

That doesn't make any sense.

Maybe you should go talk to the counselor.

Ike! Ike, what?!

How exactly are we gonna use her to scare them?

But that's our music! We like it!

Really?

Ech, even if it could work, how would we go about shutting it down?

Yes it is a big deal! Why do you think everyone washes their hands after they go to the bathroom?!

You spent $10 and eight hours to unlock a stadium?

Dude, come down here!

Aagh! For Christ's sake, Cartman, when was the last time you changed your socks?

Hey, is your show as good as America Idol?

Jesus Christ, you can't even walk down an aisle to get your candy? 

How much do we have left, Cartman?  How much do we have left, Cartman?!

You know, I heard our fourth-grade teacher is some new lady from Denver.

You bastards. Listen, we have to give a huge speech tomorrow about corporate takeovers.

We gotta run! 

Uh... W-uh... but... Come o- come on! Really? I mean, aren't there more important things going on right now?

I'm gonna take Butters. He invited me to his birthday party last month, so I owe him one.

So, do you agree to fight him after school?

Yeah. My school teacher wanted to be a woman, and you made him into one.

Seventeen? 

Maybe the problem is we don't have very good stories to report on.

Dude, what's wrong with your leg?

Come on, Stan. Hospitals aren't all that bad.

Yeah well, I can't really afford to play anymore anyway. I'm about out of quarters.

Because without big corporations we wouldn't have things like cars and computers and canned soup.

Aw crap.

It's not?

Steve, you don't have to freeze yourself. Look!

Good night.

All I'm saying is that it's gonna take a lot of singing to make up for that!

Get him!  Whoa, Tweek! Did you hear that?

Sorry, Marvin. We tried.

Cartman, where's Timmy's turkey?

It's a surprise.

Yeah. I I think so.

I TIVO every episode. We can go to my house and see what they did.

Goddammit, Chef isn't like that! Something funny is going on around here!

Do you know what those kids are going to do to you?! A little middle-class white boy telling them what to do? They are going to fucking murder you! 

Yeah. You aren't having any doubts, are you?

Because you're standing over there! 

There it is!  That must be of the antelope family.

Wow. Your mom's pregnant, Kenny.

Dude, he's pretty dead.

Then we should go to the record company. My dad's a lawyer, dude; he tells me about this stuff all the time.

Oh no.

We thought you were meeting us at Cartman's. What are you doing here, Taylor Swifting?

Will you shut the hell up?! 

Don't you "Oh, brother" me! She's the woman of my dreams!

Please, you guys. This is for Earth Day.  You care about Mother Earth, don't you?

How big do you think he is?

Man, he's pretty good.

I just... don't understand it.

Wow. I feel so rejected.

You'll see! 

The Wall-Mart is imploding! Everybody out now! 

Oh, Jesus!

Nice old Mr. Johansen runs a candy shop! He wasn't a killer and you know it!

I told you, Cartman.

I don't really give a fuck! 

Well you're NOT crazy. The whale talked to all of us. And he needs our help getting him home.

Can you guys meet me over at Cartman's house tonight at around midnight?

Dude!

Jesus Christ, dude.

He's right. We should do a merger.

Uh, we need to go to Canada. As soon as possible.

Twenty... million?  Are you nuts? We don't have that kind of money.

Yeah.

Cartman, what did you do?!

Oh that's,  yeah that's good, that's good. Alright, chapter... one...

How can you say that? Did you see what we did to their house?! It'll take them days to clean that up!

A plebeian?

Wow, dude! Your grandpa still isn't dead?

Are you Elton John?

Yeah, but how?

I said go away!  My father said you aren't real.

Hey! You can't do that! 

D'you have any wire here?

Yeah. We'll be the "Save Films From Their Own Directors" club

I can't lose another friend. First Kenny and now Stan? All I'm gonna have left are you two douches. 

What dude? 

I think he wants us to get in.

Wait a minute, Dad was the UPS man?

Rocket ships?

No way, fatty, it's mine!

Yes, ah I'm trying to locate my parents. M-my name is Kyle Broflovski. Yes, I know Obama won.

Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo. Haven't you guys ever heard of it?

Why are you being such a dick?

No! I finally do understand! There is no justice! There is no God! Do you hear me?! I renounce my faith!!

You're gonna give up on Faith Hilling just like that, Butters? How could you?

We're all saying the S-word too much! 

Who? Me? Why?

Oh! Hey Cartman. We're playing dreidel; you wanna try?

The odds on a single number in roulette are thirty-five to one.  That means, with a ten thousand dollar bet, you win three hundred and fifty thousand.

Come in.  COME IN!! 

No, Ike!

Hey yeah! What's that song she always sings? There's got to be a morning after.

Mexico here we come! 

Hey, where the hell are you going?? 

Ow! 

To me??

A U-Haul. What if we bring Muhammad to South Park in the back of a U-Haul, and he just stays in there out of sight?

I think you're awesome, Funnybot. Uh, but you can't go around taking everyone else's jobs.

Don't you think it's a little strange that Cartman keeps asking you to stay over?

Happy Passover, Cartman. 

Hoh, that sucks, dude.

I think we can do it, Stan. I've been close to a million a few times by myself.

There's no such thing as Mr. Hankey.

You don't remember?!

Just admit it, Congo! Admit that you lied about me to Irene!

What? Ready for what?

Hell no! I'm not being part of a four-member boy band! We'll look stupid!

...I am eight.

Did you hear that, dude? We still get $3000. That's enough for you to do your DNA test.

AIDS?! 

That's not cool!

Leave him alone, butthole!

Yeah, it's going to be this weekend.

We've definitely not done that before!

No! These don't belong to you! They belong to the people!

You want something new every week, fatass.

You're gonna see it.  WILL SOMEBODY GET ME A GOD DAMNED CHARGER?

The knights of Standards and Practices were created to make sure that bad words were kept to a minimum. "Curse words" They're called that because they are a curse. We have to go back to only using curse words in rare, extreme circumstances.

No way!

He'll be here. Stan wouldn't douche.

What are you saying?!

Gravy?

All the time: "Look out for your little brother, Kyle!", "Take care of your little brother, Kyle", and he wasn't even really my little brother.

That if he could prove leprechauns exist, I would suck his balls.

Go look! It's all an ancient Incan prophecy.

Man, I guess sometimes we let our technology and stuff grow too fast.

Whoa, Cartman. We aren't gonna be hippies anymore. Y-you don't have to kill us.

It matters, dude. 

Oof. 

If you don't show Mohammad, then you've made a distinction what is okay to poke fun at, and what isn't. Either it's all okay, or none of it is.

That's what you care about?! Who's the poorest kid in school now?!

Who cares if your dog is gay? Maybe it's not that bad.

Yeah!

I've been trying! But I just don't know how to make totally new friends on the Internet.

Check it out, dude. The camera shoots one frame at a time. So, all we gotta do, is put the right mouth on, according to what syllable they're pronouncing at that frame.

This is gonna suck.

Yeah. I don't remember him saying anything about this.

Dude, that's so wrong!

I don't know. Let's find out.

Yeah, I just... well I just thought our company name would be more like uh... or-original

Go, Tweek. Kick his ass! Get him!

He's asleep. Wake up fatass!

Wow, I didn't know golf games were this cool.

There he is! Now, don't let him know we think he's a loser, or else he won't play. 

Come on Eric, we can go play at the bus stop.

Cast on him again.

The blond kid?

Uuuuuuhh...

Nooo! 

Butters told us their play was awesome! 

Because, if we go to the tobacco company, I know exactly what'll happen. They'll take us in, and then Rob Reiner will show up with all the townspeople, holding torches or something, and there'll be a big showdown until we talk about what we learned, and change everyone's minds - this is all following a formula!

Well, Cartman, this is just my opinion, but I think the Line Ride sucked donkey balls!

Nah, dude. Are you on America's side, Stan? 

Scott Tenorman?

Stan.

Well uh, he'll have to do. Cartman has to get some practice with a real bull.

No! What we really should do is go to our parents right now and take responsibility for smoking ourselves. Even if it means getting grounded.

We need you to protect us... from a bully.

At who?  Heh- hang on. 

Anything that'll impress us, Token.

Well... if you put it that way...

She's not worried about you.

Okay, good. You're all here.

Yeah, dude.  Nobody does. They're too expensive.

Sorry Ms. Cartman, but your son took some things that didn't belong to him.

Yeah, but it's okay Butters. They have purity rings now.

Me?!

What the hell is wrong? "Can't find the server" Kickstarter. 

Ohhh, no you don't. That isn't gonna work on me, Canadian!

Hang in there, Ike. We're gonna get you help.

'K.  She says she's been wantin' to break up for a while, and it's nothing against you.

Mom? Can Kenny go to Jewbilee with me?

But that's not fair! You lied to me!

Dude, that's messed up. 

Our GameSphere! 

What's this comforter filled with? Um, it isn't filled with down, is it?

Kenny? 

I don't know. I feel like I should confront my mom first. But it's so embarrassing.

We're so proud of you kids!

Butters, I really think we should talk.

He's bleeding pretty bad back here.

Ah, Ah I, ah I thought...

Oh God, here we go again! 9/11 was not a conspiracy, fatass!

No way!

Wow, these books look cool!

Yeah. Ready, Cartman?

I don't know, I...

Yeah, give me that flashlight. 

Dude, w-what are you doing?

You can't talk to Stan, Wendy. He throws up when you do.

Yeah. Hey Stan, what did your dad mean when he said we're gonna play Truth or Dare?

Good job, dude! You freaked him out!

It doesn't matter. Because God is going to harden the Pharaoh's heart!

You mean, intercourse with a girl?

What's it?

How much do you think Mr. Mackey needs?

What should we do, dude? That big snake keeps growing; it's gonna demolish the whole state soon!

Dude, we have to try!

Go help him, Kenny!

Dude, you've... you've changed.

And then we won't have to show anybody the picture Kenny has of you guys sucking each other's jagons.

Damn it!

AAAAAA!

You found Cartman like this and you think he's somehow trapped in virtual reality?

No, wait. No, we have to stop them! They're raping him. Rape!

I didn't suck his balls, all right?! And I'm not going to!

You bastard! 

Mighty powerful network executives,

...How?

Seriously, Cartman. You could make money with these!

This is a really good turnout.

Why? How could you do this? There are people starving in Alabama and... and you give Cartman a million dollars?

I dunno.

How big do they say mine is? 

What are they doing?

Will you stop it with that?! What part of this is funny to you?!

No!  No, it isn't true!

Cartman, were you... crying?

Yeah. You definitely made your point.

It sure is. Do you want me to watch it with you, Ike?

Well, it isn't a guy teacher. It's a woman.

You... bastards!  Wha, what the hell is wrong with you?? What kind of Prime Minister bases his decisions on hatred?  And, and takes away mounties' horses?  And French people's wine? What the hell kind of Prime Minister are you, anyway?!

What the hell?

Aw, dude, come on. I gotta do my science homework.

Hey, Butters!  I got tickets to go see Lion King tonight, and I decided to invite  YOU before anybody else.

Why? Why do I have to accept it when I can change it?

The heart of Wall-Mart?

Cartman, what the hell are you doing?! You're suppsoed to be studying! 

Hey, look, it's Mr. Garrison.

Be sure to vote for Giant Douche.

Oh, you're doing it, or else we're gonna bust your whole scheme wide open, and tell your mom you haven't actually been at your drug rehab this whole time!

Huh?

Jesus Christ.

How long does this thing last?

No! Cartman, that was just a dream!

Why are they all out driving at the same time?

Well, that's a public school. And in it there are children,  just like us.

So you crapped out of your mouth! Good for you! It's still stupid and immature! 

But they said we can't charge the front door.

Huh?

Okay, okay. Stan, you're right. Maybe I let being a martyr go to my head. Just please, let me stay on this path, and, I'll try to be cool about it. Okay? I'm sorry.

You know what I mean! Why is my little brother watching you talking about us talking about him?!

Hey, Timmy's back!

Nono, after we found Cartman, I put the headset on and then-

Oh my God!

What?? Who cancelled us?

The red- Oh come on, you can't possibly be here for that!

Ike, you're okay. 

Who is that guy?

It is?

God, will you shut up?!

Yeah, I'm scared.

Yes! 

Awww! 

Why would he put anything in your butts?

Wow, cool.

All right, this is it! If Wall-Mart has a heart, we have to find it and destroy it! No matter what the Wall-Mart does to try to stop us, we have to be strong! Let's do it.

Trent Boyett will do it. He's the toughest, baddest kid in preschool! 

He did not say that! You just want him dead so you can have his stupid PSP!

What does that mean?

But ih-

Wha- whataya mean?

Mom! Dad! Am I gong to hell?

Thanks, Towelie.

You sleep with money. Every night?

Hey McNuggets. You wanna come play for us?

Dude! That's today!

I really thought it was gonna last.

Huh?  What the?

Me neither.

What secret truth??

I did it! Now I can go to the Raging Pussies!

I mean, what if I'm just part of my parents' reality?

Yeah. So hurry up and die, you piece of crap! 

Thanks, Mick.

Ookie mouth!  Gross! I can't do it, Ma!

Genetic Engineering Ranch!  Sweet!

Because anybody who thinks 9/11 was a conspiracy is a retard!

All right!

What was what?

All these people are going to be gaming on XBox. You really wanna just game with Craig the rest of your life?

We'll just tell your parents we're going on a camping trip with my parents. They'll never know.

I'm poopies, ma!

I guess we should all realize...  that history and alien technology really do go hand in hand. 

So you intended for us to go ziplining all along? Why, Stan?!

AAAARGH!

Dude, that kicks ass!

Dude, they're gonna look so stupid.

Wait. Isn't there some rule about not getting into cars with strnagers?

Look everybody, I know we all feel our hands are tied, but the fact is, we can do something about this. There's an app which can actually allow kids to block things that their parents watch on television. And it is password-protected with a security code that only a child would know.

Me too.

Why would Spielberg and Lucas do this?!

Your heart?

Yeah. But you know, I've learned something today. You see, the basis of all reasoning is the mind's awareness of itself. What we think, the external objects we perceive, are all like actors that come on and off stage. But our consciousness, the stage itself, is always present to us.

Yeah, our friend has been missing for a few days, so we went and checked on him, and he's in a coma wearing your headset.

Awesome. 

Hey guys, can we talk to you? 

Yeah, but you know? I think we all learned an important lesson about laughing at other people's misfortunes.

And that applies to all of us, doesn't it? Even though it's convenient to have things done for you, sometimes it's best to deal with it yourself. 

YES, dude! 

Profile status?

Yeah, Casa Bonita, this Saturday! 

Yeah.

I didn't "bail," I got picked up by the government!

And then like, out of nowhere, somebody came up with the idea of ziplining.

Yeah, but dude, he seriously could have died in that fire.

Sick, Kenny.

Stan! Go get the other guys and tell them to meet me at the bus stop in ten minutes!

Why?

You said you all wrote essays.

Yeah Stan, she's just a girl.

No.

We aren't talking about gay people.

Now she's doomed to walk the earth in limbo. 

Hunh?

They're TV dinners. Don't you wanna take that veil off so you can eat?

Dude, we'll have Chef's $2 million in no time!

No, it's still just some whiny, annoying teenager talking about how lame he is.

Don't worry, you guys. He forgot about Kenny. Kenny will help us.

Dude, I don't wanna watch this thing have a baby.

Chef, we wanna know about herpes.

Hey, it's a fire. That means there must be people. 

Set an open course for the virgin sea...

Ike! Do your impersonation of David Caruso's career!

What?!

Hoh, Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,

I- I can't do it... I can't do it. I...

Didn't you hear? They outlawed fireworks 'cause a little boy blew off his hands.

Butters! Butters, stop it!

No. No-it looked dead.

Yeah. Actually, there is.

Yeah, fat boy saw it!

Dude, did you hear what's happening?

What's the autolocate macro?

I knew you were doing something terrible!

I need to talk to you. 

Ya see Ike? There's nothing. There's nothing for you to be afraid of.

Chef Aid?

Aw, they wanna fight! They just don't know it yet! 

Uh, I think so.

Oh brother!

Yeah. We have a report to do, asshole! Get up! Get up!! 

Hello?? I've been saying this for years!

Ooww!

What's the matter, Mr. Hankey? Are you sick?

Listen, this is all you need to know: the economy is not a supernatural all-knowing entity. The economy is just an idea, made up by people, thousands of years ago. The economy is not real. And yet, it is real. Nowadays they'll give credit to practically anyone who applies for them.  I applied for this yesterday to prove a point. It is an American Express Platinum card.  It has no spending limit.  Do not be afraid! This is only plastic. It's just something made up by people. Truly meaningless until we put our faith in it. Faith is what makes an economy exist. Without faith, it is only plastic cards and paper money.

Hey dudes.

Satan talked to God?

Oh yeah?! Well you're a stupid Jew! You're a Jew! Shut your God-damned Jew mouth! Good job, Jew! Jew... Shut up, Jew! You're Jewish!! Dude, he's Jewish! Jew! Jew! Jew! Jew! Jew! Jew! Jew?! "I told you Jewish people don't have rhythm." "Fuck off, Cartman!"

Man, I would have loved to seen to seen the look on Trent Boyett's face when all the sixth graders showed up!

Remember, Tweek: punch hard, punch low.

Look, it's almost time.

Dude, I guess we've just got to try it without him.

You... missed school today?

All right, but it's gonna take more than one good player to beat the champions, Stan. You'd better have a really good game plan.

Let's go practice. 

Yeah, fatass, a dead body.

You got it, Stan!

Look, it may not seem important now, but your vote really does count, and we all have to do our part.

Oh no!

Nah. Dude, I c-I can't go to have a birthday party while Butters is missing.

Holy shit, dude! 

What?

But before he could go through with this entire plan, he discovered that the pie had already been eaten...  ...by your dog. 

I'm still breaking your Xbox. 

Somebody do something!

I'm dead to you?

Dude, asshole, you're keeping a lot of other celebrities in purgatory!

Ah, damn it! My little brother's trying to follow me to school again.

He was a McCain supporter.  It's okay, Ike. Obama will do fine.

What the hell are you doing?!

Uhh, not cool.

Dude! I almost thought those Afghani kids talked you into not liking America.

...What are you doing here?!

Well why not?!

Heeey Ike! Look what I got.  The new Call Of Duty! Do you wanna go downstairs and play?

We totally think you should have more money.

Christian rock?!

Write the number down! Write the number down!!

Oh.  Uuugh.

Jimmy, we're gonna have everyone write in a mascot that's really funny, and you have to tell us which one would be funnier.

Wuh what'd I do?

Yeah, you are! You always get in trouble

Woah... wait, what are you doing?

Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,

We're eating, dude.

Butters! We said you can't watch it! We have a quest!

Barking vaginal belch.

You bastards!

They picked up my hash tag, Stan! I'm trending!

I know, but he posted a message of me with a schlong on my head.

Goddamnit, don't you get it?! I hate pee! I'm grossed out by pee! The only thing I find more disgusting than pee is bananas!

There aren't gonna be new shows! Don't you get it?! Terrance and Phillip are Canadian! We have to get Canada to end this strike!

I made you out of clay.

Alright alright Kenny, calm down. You're too young to be getting BJs anyway. It's good you and Tammy are making a commitment to each other that isn't based on sex.

Just tell us, Butters.

You're on, fat boy!

Why?

Oh no! What have we done?!

No, dude, you don't wanna bring your people to Mexico, there's missionaries there, too.

Yah.

Dude, we don't have time for your stupid jokes! We're gonna die!

Aw, just forget it! 

Yup!

Cartman!!! 

Yeah, it's Ms. Choksondik alright.

Dude, you're just jealous because I'm Chinpoko Master!

Hey Cartman, I need to talk to you.

Oh God...

You did, dude! You drank his whole body!

Costumes and candy.

No!

Yeah, they're almost as big as his mom's. 

But won't your grampa be there?

Hey! What about this guy?!

Dude, don't call my brother a dildo!

Well I wish I didn't have any parents! 

How about... finkleroy?

God-dammit Cartman! You broke it!

It's too late for that. Things just can't go back, Stan, uh.  Ah-I'm with Cartman Burger now.

Dude! Bebe is really smart!

Dude, I was having this horrible nightmare that we were at this house, and it was filled with Cartmans!

No, I'm serious! I wanna see what's happening downstairs, so let's just do it! 

Right. You're Timmy.

He's half man and half bearpig

No, I mean, this is impossible, Stan! Cartman is the biggest asshole in the world! How is it that God gives him a million dollars?

Because we keep getting screwed over by your diarrhea!

Fart, damn you!

Jambu? Jambu?  Cool! It worked! Hey, Jambu.

Probably?! Is Atlantis real??

Yeah dude. You were totally wrong.

Wait a minute. Who is that?

But you're lying to people. If they knew that you didn't eat just all the sandwiches you want, you might not be so popular.

Oh God... 

What do you wanna talk about?

Yeah?

Agggh! Agggh!  No! 

No no, it's n-it's not like it sounds. Here, check it out.  See look, we just video the babies fighting over a ball full of crack. It's really getting popular!  I mean it, it's cool because like the commercial said, the crack babies had nothing before.  It, it's great, because everyone wins, you know? You see that? Two million hits.  Did you know they're putting bacon inside of pancakes at Denny's?

What do you want?!

All right, look, th-that isn't mine. I'm just holding it for a friend.

Congratulations, sister. You have heard the noble truth and are now a Blaintologist.

What?

Thanks for saving us Stan. You're my Super Best Friend.

Oh my God, you're right! You're totally right!! EVERYONE! GET A NEW TREND GOING! FAST! #webelieveinyou!

Our main point is that the flag shouldn't offend anyone, because killing has been around since the beginning of time. All animals kill.  And the animals that don't kill are stupid ones, like cows and turtles and stuff. So people should not be so upset about killing. 

What if the residue gets on our hands and it leads to harder drugs like those commercials say.

Well, yes, I think so.

Jesus, we made it just in time! 

What??

He didn't want us for sex, fatass! Something is making him say those things.

Ike is starting his first day of kindergarten.

Dude, what kind of sick joke is that? Girls suck ass.

This was supposed to be my story! My coming to terms with a guilty conscience! This isn't fair!

We have problems!

We have to watch them! We can't miss it!

Stan! What the fuck?!

In your butts?

I'm not inviting you, Cartman. You can't go.

What's this all about, Kenny?

I'm sorry, Cartman. There's been a little change in plans!

Yeah.

I don't get it either.

Scott Tenorman is an eighth grader who sold Cartman his pubes for ten dollars, and now Cartman's all pissed off.

Well, I had to see it to believe it!

No you're not, dude! You're a guy in a panda costume! 

Clyde got $3000 from his mom's life insurance

Well, maybe we'll get ours soon, too. I'm gonna go and see if I'm bleeding out my ass.

Don't worry. Everything's gonna work out. It always does.

Cartman?

Yeah, but maybe we need a name that's more affirming, like, shows what we stand for.

Just just leave it alone.

Butters has been missing for a week! You might have inadvertently gotten him killed!

You bastards! 

Wow, dude, Terrance got really fat.

Okay, here's the one part that really makes no sense to me:  the first time you saw blood stains on your underwear, were you alarmed?

It matters, Stan. It it matters.

Aren't you hungry Kenny? 

...What?

What?

Aw Goddamnit, now you've made me miss my ride! My whole day is screwed up because of you! 

Look, he knows full well what he's doing, and he's just waiting for us to buy into it, and then he'll laugh and point at our faces and say, "Haha, I got you guys to believe me!" "You guys are stupid!"

No! It's alright! Just give me some time to work on them. I'll see you guys later. 

Aaaargh! 

Well, I guess it's mostly the way Mr. Garrison stuck a gerbil up Mr. Slave's ass.

What the hell are you so happy about, fatass?! 

Uh oh. I guess we shouldn't have made him eat it. 

I didn't do anything to you. Timmy saw the turkey and wanted to get it. What do you want me to say to him?

WHY ARE THEY DOING THIIIS?!

I mean, come on guys, that's pretty cool, right? My little brother is a knight in Canada. 

Yeah, there's this guy named Jack Leborkian that goes around and murders people that ask him to, and he doesn't get in any trouble at all.

Yeah, sorry dude uh, I can't make it either.

Uuuh, okay.  Gah!

Ugh. You've gotta be kidding me!

What?

No, I just can't get it to load.

It's stupid!

No, it's not cool!

Uh, it's okay. We know the owner.

You wanna bet?  Let's go ask my Dad right now!

Man, it's really starting to snow.  I hope they don't close the roads.

He isn't actually going to show everyone...

NO! Hybrid cars are a good thing!

They want twenty million dollars.

Are you fucking kidding me?! 

Whoa! 

No! 

Shut up, fat boy!

We need you, Butters. You're the man! 

What if we do a show where we-  Uh, no.

If everyone is turned into zombies...

Don't worry. There's gotta be another cash for gold place around here somewhere.

It was him. It had to have been him!

Well, I mean, you didn't just start at 40, didja? You you gotta low-ball these things so you have a place to go.

Dude, I don't think we should be messing around with that crap anymore.

Go on by, Michael. 

Look, dude, things around here have changed. Sometimes, the only way to keep going is to make a left turn.

Please, you guys, you don't understand.  My family is devastated. My mom just walks around the house like a zombie, and my dad can't stop crying.

Oh.

Oh my God.

We wish- 

Only sixteen dollars? They can't be cool if they're only sixteen dollars. 

We can get everyone back into the Christmas spirit by making our very own animated Christmas special, and showing it to everybody in town! 

I, I know it's tough but-  Look at me!  I know it's tough, okay?! I know! But we have to be tough right now!

Do we? He's a legend!

Dude, an awards show just for comedy sounds like a bad idea.

Well, yeah, but what if the grampa wants to die, cause he's really old, and he's just asking for help?

Really?

He recognizes you dude.

Yeah yeah, ahh I'll be right there.

I don't want to! It's a stupid name! 

Oh crap. 

All right! We're getting the hell out of here! 

Whoa, dude.

Mr. Garrison, we've been watching Barnaby Jones repeats for eight days now. It's hard to keep paying attention.

Please, sir.

The stop drinking Double Dew, fatass!

Excuse me, sir? I think I know who did this. We saw this guy at the last crime scene, and, and you know how serial killers sometimes return to the scene of the crime? Well, I followed this guy to his house, and when he left again, I collected some fingerprints and did a blood-sample analysis.  I'm pretty sure he's your man.

Because some people think vaccinations can give you autism or Asperger's!

Well, as Abraham Lincoln, I accept your surrender, and agree to your conditions. You and all the Confederates will have all the S'more Schnapps you can drink for a year.

What's High School Musical 3?

I am doing it.

Dude, look, we, we just saw all this stuff on History Channel.

What are you doing, fatass?!

...And when she moved up and down, the little fetus jiggled.

Shut up, Cartman!

He does not!

Well, I'm Jewish.

Yes. Three friends. You're not my friend.

Wagh. 

Is that what you learned in sex ed?

Yeah.

Hey, wait a minute. Towelie always showed up to give us towel advice when we'd said something about water.

Elder, It's not my fault. He told me he was Jewish.

What?

Wow, you know, Cartman? That is an awesome idea. You should totally go to Somalia.

Yeah. I guess... I guess everything is.

Yeah! What the hell were we thinking?! Boooooo!

Dude, did you see that stuff Phil Collins was saying about Timmy?

Dude, if 4 million people play the brown noise at the same time-

It seems like I might get splinters, though.

I am picking up carbon-based life forms in Sector C. I believe we will find a village of peaceful aliens over that ridge. 

Dude! I've been freaked out this whole time because of that guy's movie?

Well, how about we just say, "corporates should be stopped"?

The skin's the best part...

It’s the same goddamn song!

Come on, Stan! Just strike this kid out so we can end the season! 

Because you're my little brother, Godddamnit!  And even when I'm fifty and you're forty-five, you're still gonna be my little brother!

Kenny, we have got to make Stan understand the importance of voting, because he'll definitely vote for our guy.

What?

NO!

Let's do it Wing!

Dude, because! You have to stand up for yourself! So will you fight him? 

We've gotta keep this away from him.

God-damnit! 

Do with us what you will, Mr. Lucas!  But please, don't change Raiders of the Lost Ark.

But how can the Jews make it better??

I'm ba-ack.

......Dude.

Those XBox Ones are as good as ours!

Who the fuck are you?!

Love ...is the most important thing on... earth. When boys and girls feel ...love, they kiss.

Well, I mean, all last week you were ripping on ginger kids and now you are one.

I'm not completely sure.

You dumbass, Cartman! Now they're gonna go squeeze his balls!

Well what are you watching?

Damn! I thought fourth grade was gonna be different.

Killer.

Oh well, I I grew up in the shity, ah ah I really don't care for it. Ah I come from a Jewish family, which of course you already know, because Kyle's from the same family.  I like to read, and I have these polyps on the backs of my hands - I don't know what they are.

Good thinking

What?

Yes, I believe that you believe you helped write that joke. That's how people like you work! Your ego is so out of whack that it will do whatever it can to protect itself. And people with a messed up ego can do these mental gymnastics to convince themselves they're awesome, when really, they're just douchebags! 

Oh shut up Cartman! You don't even know what you're talking about!

Yeah. See ya. 

Ha! You lose, fatass!

Stop it, Cartman!

Dude, that is a sweet RC car!

Why?! So that we can lose our business and everything can go back to old times?!

The Earth show can still be good. Just erase everyone's memory so we don't know we're a show.

Wait. Stan?  Hold on, is this my virtual reality, or Cartman's virtual reality?

I don't want you to jump them, retard!

Get it! 

You don't think that-? But he isn't real.

Oh, uh, wawawhat is this?

You hear that Clyde?

You don't get it, Stan! I can play here all I want. I even get free Frescas. I don't need you anymore! 

...Homeland Security?

No way.

Be a good boy? You know all about this?

Nuh uh.

It's too late, fatass.  They'll be here in less than a minute.

But you know, I've learned something today. I've learned that people who want power, a lot of power, always... end up dead.

You mean this one?

Yes! It did!

NOOOO!

Date-rape something. Yeah. Okay. I will. Okay, thanks, Mon.  I don't have to go outside!

Cartman, what the hell are you doing?

Hey, wait a minute.  Is it possible that...

Dude, bail?

Nope! We're gonna have all the pizza you can eat, twenty different cakes, and Lorde is going to play live!

Yeah, but you know? I think you've learned something today. You've learned that you can't rewrite history.  You see, history is forever,  and everything happens for a reason.  Sure, you can try and change the past, but usually you kno-

Come on! 

Cyborg Bill isn't cool anymore?

What happened to you?

This is gonna be fun.

We've gotta find the television department. 

Is that an umbrella you're using?

We got the money, Mr. Hankey. We're gonna make our animated Christmas card.

Come on, guys! 

Yeah. I think I'm actually learning something. 

What?!

I DIDN'T THINK THERE WAS GOING TO BE A GOD-DAMNED LEPRECHAUN!!

Sure. 

Look, Stam, we-we just wanted to be able to go to the movies and enjoy ourselves, you know? I'm sorry but... you're a bummer to be around. Everything is "that looks like shit" and, and "this is shitty!"

Yeah, why's your family so poor Kenny?

Alright, alright, let's get this over with so we can put her back!

God-dammit! If we miss the commercials, I'll never forgive my brother!

Yes, I did! I said from the beginning that you would do this!

Uhn, you don't understand! My friend is in Imaginationland! I can hear him in my head!

Wow!

You know, could youuu...

Um I think we're just heading deeper into the mountains.

Yeah. It's not a very satisfying feeling.

That's not true. Kids at school like us. Don't they?

... K.

I got it mail ordered from Africa.  The ad said it would take 4 to 6 weeks, but it only took three.

About what?

Wow. Did he say that in the Bible?

Stan? 

They are?

You gotta be kidding me!

Too eager to what?

No he didn't kill him, he's still breathing!  Get up!  Get UP! 

Ike, I don't care if you wanna grow up, I just wanna be by your side while you do it.

Do the right thing, Mr. President.

No, no, uh I wanna be tall and black.

Cartman, no!

Dude! Let's go look for crocodiles!

Cartman! What kind of costume is that?

And we don't care.

Noo, I'll just... be... going back to bed now.

But he's just using his time on television to rant about-

Okay, right behind Stan.

Cartman, you only come to soccer practice on Fridays, and that's only because we have Kentucky Fried Chicken afterwards!

You are the fucking History Channel!

He's right, dude. We have to define our style if we're ever going to make a platinum album. I mean, ah I'm a fusion guy, but Kenny's background is more Latin Jazz.

Ot- Nice to meet you, Cartman. Yuh you know, I saw that same jacket you're wearing at Bosco's for $29.95. How much was yours? Um, I juh- I was just wondering if Bosco's is a ripoff?

Jesus, man, those Earth Day people don't screw around!

Mr. Garrison, were you in Vietnam?

Do we have everything?

Because we do. It was like this yesterday, and the day before that.

Dude, we have got to get that kid away from him!

Uh. All I did was show her how to-

Hey.  That's a great idea!

I don't know.

I found the number for a really cheap airline to Canada. If we go as soon as possible, then-

We want to talk to who's in charge.

Dad, Dad, Jesus Christ!

Dude, are you okay?

Fine!  Then YOU do it, you're so tough!

The history of Easter.

How can they make a show out of this? I wasn't even agreeing with them. 

Oh dude, we are gonna get it now.

Kenny'll believe whatever you want him to.

Phew.

Wait a minute, that thing landed on Kenny, and they took him to the mortuary.

Sure you do!

It's the evil pets 

Because then you can pay us to use our friend in commercials.

Oh no, I'm not sane yet!

HA! I killed you!

Yeah!  We'll show them! 

Where are we going?

I'm still not inviting you to Casa Bonita.

Ike, there's been a mistake. You don't understand.

We've got to do something.

Oh no! It's that  super-sad Sarah McLachlan commercial! Look away!

Oh God! It wasn't thirty, it was one! He jumped over one homeless person with his stupid skateboard, and he barely made it over that guy!

Jesus Christ, finally!

Dude, this is the saddest commercial ever! Don't watch! 

Aw, I just hit my nose playing dodgeball.

You've gotta try and stay on for ten seconds. Okay, Cartman?

Look! There they are!

How do we have a choice?!

Let's do this together, dude.  Our only shot at playing any next-gen console is by teaming up. If you wanna game on a PS4, then I do too.

Well, why did you pull it out of the trash?

It kind of looks like... an egg.

Don't fart on your way out; you might make little smoke signals. 

Ma'am, please, I think my little brother needs immediate help.

U-u-uh, hi. 

Excuse me.  Do you know which way the network president's office is?

Oh. Okay, it's over this way 

Mister Father!  We have to ask you something.

Oh my God, they killed Kenny!

To the Genetical Engineering Ranch.

Kenny, we need to have a serious talk.

Dad? Are you sure there's time?

Hang on.  Hold on a second.  I gues... I... guess... this is... goodbye, Willzy-x.  I'm gonna miss you.  Hey, don't forget me, okay? I won't forget you. 

Ha! Our bet was that you would get a platinum album, not a myrrh album! I don't owe you anything, fat boy!

Cartman, you are poor and you are stupid!

Stan! You've got to help us become good Christians. Please.

How about fifty daura?

We put a stop to it, until YOU taught them Minecraft.

Oh, man. I can't just sit here, I have to help my stupid brother, or I'll come home without him and my dad will start yelling, "Where's your brother, Kyle?" "You weren't looking out for your little brother, Kyle?"

Damn, what a freak!

From what?

Hey Cartman! We're almost to level 20! You giving birth in there, or what?

That son of a bitch!

Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with dreidel I will play
Second verse, same as the first
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidelll-I ma...

Quick, Marvin. Get us to Marklar.

Hey, how do we know if she's pregnant?

What?

Oh yeah.  Fine, I'll kick your ass tomorrow, dick! 

Yeah.

Me too.

Oh boy...

Don't try and stop me, Stan! You don't know how it feels to be a deformed monstrosity!

Well, we've got something to tell you about Veronica, Chef!

Ike, Ike, you have to be honest. Am I ugly, yes or no?  You ALL think I'm ugly. Jesus Christ, the least you could have done is told me!

Excuse me? Could we get through here?

Awesome!

Bebe, I thought we were going to watch Terrance & Phillip today.

Damnit!

No! ...Not... not like you're saying.

Ike, what's the matter?  Dude, you've been in here crying all morning. What's going on?  Oh. My. God. Ike, a-are you sure about this?

Dude! We're surrounded by perverts.

Kenny didn't have the head lice, all right?!  It was me.

He won't listen to us, but he would listen to- Gordon Ramsay.

I said I'm sorry, you piece of sh- 

I don't know you, dude.

Yeah, but you know, I've learned something today. It would have been wrong to exploit Butters' weight loss. Because then lots of fat people would have believed it. And then gone and eaten a ton of Chinese food instead of dieting properly. They'd still be fat and, we'd be responsible for their shattered dreams.

Damn it!

Yes.

Yes.

I can't reach the CPU.

Coffee? I don't think I like coffee.

Know what?

Get the bull in the balls with a snowball.

I don't know what to do.  Part of me feels like I wanna end it all now.  Tell people what heppened. You know, I never knew how beautiful this pond was before.  So cold. The world can feel like that.  So calm on the outside, as if nothing bad ever happens.  Ow.  What the hell are you doing, Cartman?!

Whoa!

We're, we're in trouble. We're in sooo much trouble.

Look! Crack addicts with a television! 

Can't we just play hide and seek at home?

Yes, I know that! Why do you think I've been putting up with his farts?!

Look! 

Whoa whoa wait a minute!  This isn't what I signed up for! I like Family Guy. Why do we have to get it off the air forever?

HELP! 

Right, you're not fat.

When we said "documentary," I thought we meant 60 Minutes, not Honey Boo Boo!

What the hell are they doing??

Then take that shit off speaker phone!!

Aww, come on!

Here.  Just look more closely at it.

Probably just another stupid dreidel anyway.

Dude, I thought she was dead.

I don't need to. It wouldn't work.

Wow, I guess this really is a big deal.

What? Y-you gotta vote, dude. Haven't you seen the Rock the Vote stuff or, or Puff Daddy's Vote or Die?!

For what?

Sure we'll help! 

Cartman??

We know, Cartman!

Which song is that?

Well, I... kind of gave a homeless guy twenty dollars last night.

It's Stan! 

Terrible. Every time I close my eyes I see the house we TP'ed. I see the tears of our art teacher and hear the screams of her daughters.

Ms. Ellen, dude! She's beautiful! 

Oh! Tha-oh, yeah, the the startup company thing didn't really work out.

What?

Uh, nice costume, dude. Who are you supposed to be? Luke Perry?

Something must have happened to Chef while he was gone. Maybe he hit his head or, or got stuck in some quantum time vortex.

Ike!

That's it.  I'm going to combine my elephant with a pot-bellied pig and make…pot-bellied elephants.  They'd be smart like elephants, but small like pigs.

I've got something to show Steve, dick!

I-Ike, this is a big deal. You have to be absolutely, 100%-

Well, maybe we can sneak in over there. Come on.  Sshh. 

What?

Alright, that does it, Cartman! That's my grandma! You show her some God-damned respect!

Again?

What the hell is wrong with you, Cartman? Haven't you noticed the three feet of snow on the ground?

Aw I don't think he wants to play, dude.

Look, we don't have a lot of time here, okay? Can you just tell us where the new Prime Minister is?

Fatass Cartman was
not on the school bus today.
What a big, fat turd.

I need you to keep quiet about this, all right?  My little brother and his tea-

You're not the real Mr. Hankey.

Dude! Those gaywads are on our side?

Are you gonna burn me?

Stan, if I didn't know you better, I would almost think you're doing this because you wanna play with girls.

There is no such thing as a funny fuse, Cartman. You felt bad.

Big corporations are good!

Ike, is that chewing tobacco?

What was it about? Ih-in case our teacher asks us.

Hehe. Sissy.

Dude, boars are only worth two experience points apiece. Do you know how many we would have to kill to get up 30 levels?

Later.

You know what I like best about you? You don't say, "hella," like our Cartman does. I swear, if he says that one more time, I'm gonna kill him! 

Oh my God! 

Cartman? You'd better be studying, God-damnit! 

Did it work?

What? 

Oh my God, they killed Kenny. You Bastard!!!

Stan? 

Yeah, but you're our new friend and that makes you cul.. p-piable!

You might as well just say Pilgrims and Indians were all aliens who came here and made some kind of intergalactic treaty!

Nancy Kerrigan got the silver, dude. She came in second.

Then why did Butters say he helped you sneak into my room last Friday night?! 

Oh. ...Thanks?

We really think this is gonna work, Stan. All we have to do is convince your dad that his cooking sucks, right?

But there's only four of you.

Mom! Dad! I have awesome news! The doctor who gave Mr. Garrison his sex change said he can make me tall and black. 

I got some sound advice... from an old friend. 

What? This isn't history.

Oh my God! Look at his leg!

Bu- but I got these tickets to see Lion King on stage.

...Power.

Hey dudes. 

We'll never stop them now.

Yeah. You used to sit in the living room with family and friends to hear their commentary on things. Now you can get it with a l-

Whew.

My fault?

People aren't gonna support our company if we dig in our heels and say we don't care about anything!

I can sing the Mr. Hankey song...

It was such a long time ago!

Well, I- guess we'll see you in school tomorrow, Chef.

What does me being a Jew have to do with anything?!

But how are we gonna get to the North Pole?

Mr. Garrison, didn't the guy who shot John Lennon say it was because of this book?

Ike?

You bastards!

Hoh God, here we go.

Yeah, b-but how?

You bastards! 

How do we find somebody who can wrestle that well?

What the hell is wrong with them? 

He does?

Dude, we have to get rid of our weapons so at least we can try to deny everything.

You've always been a dick to me, Cartman, and I'm not inviting you. 

AAAAAAAAAAAA- 

Aaaah!

Cartman, you're supposed to be studying! What the hell is all this?!

It's too bad Cartman can't be here to enjoy this.

I told you Tom Brokaw doesn't have a mustache, fatass!

...Cartman?

Yeah, It was seriously the most manly thing that's ever happened.

Dude, I think we broke him.

We-ull, some fish would be great if it isn't too much trouble.

Why do people have to keep reminding us of what we don't have?!

NO. I can't, Wendy.  All his negativity is starting to make me depressed. I have to let him go.  And whatever happens next, I'm going to embrace with a totally  positive attitude.

That's terrible!

So you know it.

...I'm kind of finger painting right now.

You're such a fatass, Cartman.

Whattaya think?

Terrible.

You mean everyone has been wanting Britney Spears to kill herself?

No! Please, we have to go!

You just push it on other people?!

You ready for the big show, Timmy?

Huh? No.

You guys!  You gotta help me. These business casual G-men are trying to kidnap me!

Fine! But when you're naked and jackin' it in San Diego, don't ask me for help! 

I hate you. 

Omigod! Omigod! Omigod!

Dude, is that your dad?

Tha- that's diarrhea.

Chinese radicals?

Does anybody know anything about corporations? 

Umm. Dare?

Dude, they don't care we knocked Butters' eye out with weapons?

Would you excuse us for a second?  You just can't expect me to sit there and say nothing. No, Ike, I'm supposed to be looking out for you. So what? I wasn't going to just blurt it out, I was gonna use some tact, but you won't even let me... What? Uh uh! Stop right there, Ike!  Mom, I think maybe you should talk to Ike about love and sex!

If it'll make you leave me alone, then just take the damned thing! Here!  There. Now, get out of my house! And I hope you feel really, really good about yourself!

...Thanks. 

I saw The Passion!

Kenny, how many of my dad's mints are you gonna eat? Jesus!

That's not what I meant by doing something about it, Cartman!

Whoa, dude. Your dad is watching Terrance and Phillip.

Oh my God... their pitcher was able to hit him right on the bat.

Right now.

Dude, what the hell? Somebody's gotta stop him.

It wasn't my idea to burn the Wall-Mart down.

It's working! They're turning back to normal.

Yeah. He doesn't even know that the South loses the Civil War.

Here, this one's from me, Stan.

I can't deal with it, Stan. I mean, all the stuff I've been reading; I really don't think I exist!

Hoh, Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,

Oh!  Phew.

Oh, Jesus...

Come on, fatass! You shouldn't be eating all that cake anyway!

Alright, ahhh, why don't we do something else?

Don't, don't act for me, Stan! Really?! Because every minute I'm watching this video become less about awareness and more about you!

Yeah. I think we should get the hell out of here.

That penisbutt didn't lose weight eating sub sandwiches. He lost weight because he ate less of them and exercised.

I'm sure that would scare the hell out of him, Cartman.

NO! I put your headset on, and came here to-

Please stop!

So how much done is that?

What?

Uh

No??

You're not getting away with this, you fat turd! 

Butters, get away from me!

...No, dude, that's Christmas.

There's a big wait to sit down.

We've gotta go tell somebody, quick!

So where are students getting all this cough medicine??  This surveillance footage shows a group of troubled kids getting all the smack they want from a pharmacist!  Sexy Action School News reported the pharmacist to the South Park police, and he was immediately arrested! 

Screw you, Cartman!

Come on, Ike, we can make it just in time for dinner. 

You?? Why?

Hey, let's ask them. 

Cartman? Go, Cartman.

Sure, outlander. I'll get it 

You're on, fat boy!

Stupid talent agents!

No Mr. President!! Don't do it!  Help!

I don't know. Ever since he was in that movie, he got all famous.

I don't see it.

Wait. The U.S. Government has a portal to the imagination?

What?

Yeah, but, why can't XBox automatically let you pre-order Metal Gear Solid V?

I'm a Paladin, Cartman!

Yeah. Look what he did to our friend, Kenny.

Why won't anybody listen to me?!

Jesus Christ! 

Ih it's me, Kyle Broflovski. I had a negroplasty. Can I play in the All-State team now?

Wha?! Well wait, ahah I wanna see what happens here!

You guys. Somebody is following us.

You're okay with everything you think going up on the Internet?

Wow. There must be at least 20 people out there. 

Yeah... He must be really sick.  Hang on Willzy-x. There's still hope. Stan and Craig might still luck with the space program down in Mexico.

No.

Yeah. And you know, now that I think about it, third grade wasn't all that great, either.

What??

Oh... Okay.

Hey, are you guys gonna come to Ike's party this weekend?

Move on?! Our friend was raped, Stan! He was raped, and we all stood there and did  nothing!

Heh, don't, don't tell him what it is, dude.

Oh my God! Our GameSphere! You've gotta move me closer! 

Broflovski looks for Kenny to get clear for the pass.

Well, I just found out I'm a sex addict. I'm so scared, I haven't even told my mom yet.

When Kickstarter went down, many saw their startup projects die, but here at Washington Redskins, we saw opportunity. People still need a way to raise money for their stupid startup projects, and with the Redskins you can now go fund yourself.  And the idea is simple. You, the people, go out and raise all your own money, and give the Washington Redskins 5%.

Um, no.

Clear!

No!

There's some terrorists or bankrobbers or something that have taken our class hostage!

Sally Struthers, dude. She used to be on Full House.

WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE!

Because they taste so yummy. 

Will your sister let us watch it?

What did he do?

Come on, Chef! You can do it!

I just have a feeling this might be the last time we get to do this.

Hey dude, people are kind of pissed off at you.

Tweek and Craig are gonna fight.

...Smalls. 

It's working! 

You insensitive asshole, Cartman! Nine people died!

Are there any questions?  Yes, Mr. Garrison?

I'm not cheesing. I've never cheesed once in my life.

Alright Cartman, I've been doin' a lot of thinking about how the company's gonna spend the money we make off the EA Sports deal. We're going to use thirty percent of the money to build an orphanage for the crack babies.

Jesus, dude! 

But this video game can make a million dollars. We have to give the crack babies a piece of that.

Don't you remember? That time we were out hunting with your uncle Jimbo and Ned.

Dude, nobody gives a crap about who your stupid father is! Muhammad is an important issue with actual ethical ramifications!

Where is it coming from?

You guys, I feel kinda bad for that kid.

Uh, what are "studzes"

We believe that films are pieces of art that must be preserved from the perverse hands of their agent filmmakers..

Hold it!  Principal Victoria, Mr. Mackey, Mrs. Streible. We have something we need to tell you.

Yeah, but it was totally worth it. 

And then Craig was all like, "Tweek is scared o'me. He's a big chicken." And he started doing an impersonation of you being a chicken;  well, everybody in the world saw it!

Hey, we'd do anything for our bros, man.

Well, this is what I believe in now, Stan. And if you can't respect that,... then I guess we're not best friends anymore. 

We don't have time for this! Kenny, keep him away from us! 

Patrick Duffy? Damn it Cartman, that's not scary!

Oh Jesus.

Alright, dickhole! 

Yummy yummy.

...Oh, and I hope one day to be an investment banker.

You'll never turn ME into a metrosexual! I like being a dirty, filthy little boy!

She's here!

Like you! Maybe you just need to let your hair down. And let's see how you look without those glasses.  Let's just... put those back on. 

...What?

Yeah, you're still fat!

I don't know.

No. Then I came into this virtual space.

Jambu! Jambu, why didn't you speak up before?

Yes!

Excuse us, we're trying to get a picture of Britney Spears!

Yeah, what if they had modified the Roman Coliseum every year? It would just be another big douchey stadium now.

Hohly crahap, duhude, heh!

Wikileaks.  It says here his name is Wikileaks.

Dad.

Dude, it's been twelve hours. Where the hell are our parents?!

Fart, damn you!

You liar, Cartman!

Yeah. I think Phil Collins rocks the house.

All I wanted was to play one level of Call of Duty and you know what Ike told me? He said the living room was for old people.

God damn it Cartman!

Well? Are you happy, Cartman? Butters is completely traumatized!

Alright, Dad! 

Stop it, Cartman!

He said they come on urgent business.

Who is this?

"We cordially invite you to attend the platinum album award ceremony, which will be held tomorrow morning at ten. Details and proof of sales enclosed. P.S. Nananana na na. Hahahaha ha ha."  He did it. Cartman got a platinum album.

If you didn't eat so much, you wouldn't have diarrhea all the time, fatass!

We won't let it happen again, Mr. Mackey, m'kay? 

... I'm hanging up now.

Oh, Jesus. You told him that?! 

O-Okay.  But don't scare him...

When is Mr. Hat coming back?

Say something, Mr. Hankey! 

Wow, that was easy.

Dude, when he gets out of Juvenile Hall, he's gonna wanna kill us!

So, all boy bands have five members.

I thought of it two days ago!

So... the Vatican took Stan's dad?

You fat piece of shit!

Earth?

AAAAAAAAAAAAH!

Comoe back here! 

Yeah, me neither.

Cartman, you fatass tattle-tale!

Yeah. 

Yeah, you have to hit him.

Maybe their baby will be still-born, like Cartman was. 

AAAAAAAA!

Dude! He got a lawyer?

You got my note?

See? We're just watching cartoons, like always. Nothing's changed.

Stan, you can't leave!

No, not ham, you fat fuck!

He was huge.

You sent us over to Kenny's house on purpose! You wanted us to get sick!

Dude! Nobody wants to hear you commenting on things!

Let's Plays?

You see? Nothing, dude. Just a bunch of stars.

Huh? I thought you wanted to leave.

Don't worry about it.

I went up to Jambu's tank and I tapped three times like the trainer did. Jambu swam up and started talking to me about rocket ships! Come on! You gotta check it out! 

Terrorists?

Wow, cool!

Cartman, what's going on?!

Pansy.

What? How do you know?

Dad, can I borrow three hundred dollars?

He'd be better used as a coat rack. 

Don't try to take me away again, Mom and Dad! I told you! I renounced the Jewish faith!

No way! Tweek's cool!

I mean, yeyou people are all just such hick jock rednecks; it's just like you right out of a stereotyped catalog.  Ah I can't take it. See ya. 

Hey dudes.

All right, you see, Clyde. Okay, we wanna help him sue whoever invented the toilet.

Okay. 

The acid. Dude, I'm totally tripping balls.

Dude, don't kill your mom. That's not cool.

He's not highly intelligent.

Wait. Kenny's going to die?

Anyway, that will give me plenty of time playing video games.

I know, but dude, we can't license our games to EA Sports and pay the crack babies nothing. Slavery is illegal.

For reals? 

Well! I hope it lived up to all the hype! You must feel so much better now!

We don't know what you're talking about, lardbutt.

Well whattaya mean?

Wow, cartoons are getting really dirty!

He just had to shuffle it.

I thought of it first!

This must be it. 

I think... I know what's wrong.

He's a talking piece of poo that lives in the sewer. But now he's getting sick because his egosystem is all out of whack because of all the extra poo in the sewer. If you don't all leave and go home soon, Mr. Hankey's gonna die. He's one of my best friends in the whole wide worldeh, and I don't want him to die. 

He's targeting us.

Butters, people can't just go around beating up people who have diabetes! Now whatever your problem is, you just-

Would you please just open your wormhole?!

Jambu! Jambu, I'm back!  How are you feeling?  Huhm. Jambu, you wanna talk about rocket ships?  Ja- Jambu? Are you still feelin' lonely here?

What's that?

HAAHH!!! 

I'm sorry.  I I'm sorry, I can't do this.  I'm not doing this. 

I'll never forget you. You were my best friend after Stan.

Yeah, fatass, this is their famous Mechanic sketch.

Alright, Butters. Bring it in.

Yeahyeah, Mom. I-I can't go to the lake. No, S-stan's having emotional problems and I need to help see him through it. He's got-  wha-what is it?

Who's everyone?! Who all is in on this?!

No. They're not a part of your betrayal?

Yeah.  Hey Riley! Try this hamburger.  Cartman made them himself.

Hut, hut. 

Jesus Christ!

Are you serious?? Look around: doesn't this bother you at all??  That's YOU one day, fatass! Not even one day! If you don't change something, that's you! In about a year! 

You can't do what he wants just because he's the one threatening you with violence!

People of all colors and creeds holding hands beneath a rainbow!

What do you think you're doing?!

Yup. 

Mr. Garrison, it's Kyle! Our egg is okay! We'll be there in a couple of minutes!

Gracias.

Vi, Visitors, this morning you took my little brother, Ike. He's the little freckled kid that looks like a football. At first, I was happy you took him away. But I've learned something today. That having a little brother... is a pretty special thing.

Hey Token.  You-you gonna watch the game tonight, Butters? 

Stop kissing ass, Cartman!

Yeah, real life is so boring and stupid.

I'm a Jew
A lonely Jew...

Cartman, you need to stop this stupid little game you're playing!

All right, where should we trick-or-treat first?

My guess would be 'yes.'

How the hell did they find out it was us that TP'ed that house?

What, did he lose a hundred pounds? 

Shut up, fatass! Everyone knows I can spell better than you.

Well, I've gotta go start our animation. We've only got two days. 

Girls like shaved balls?

"My parents molestered me."

But my parents are gonna cut off his ding-dong!

What??

Steve, look out! 

So, dude, do you have any brothers or sisters?

You're a fat skank, Mom, and your tits belong in a morgue. 

'Cause they're gonna get slaughtered tomorrow, butthole!

I thought I did. 

Thanks. 

All right Stan!

But how are we gonna get the balls put on Butters' chin?

Yeah. I bet they could make a fake set of balls. Come on, Butters!

Oh my God! Look at his leg!

Will you knock it off already?!

You wish-

You're such a fat baby!

What, doughboy?

Wendy, it isn't your egg anymore!

Mr. Mackey, can I talk to you?

Yeah. But there was so much of it. I was up until two in the morning.

Hey yeah, I remember that.

Plase sir, they're gonna kill our friend!

...Grrrr!!! 

Listen, you don't have to do this! Our imaginations aren't running wild anymore.

Well, Cartman

Stan?

McNuggets is scared. He doesn't wanna play.

Since Abraham, fatass!

But why not? You said sometimes people need surgery to make them feel better about themselves.

Get out of my way or I'll kick your ass!

We have to stop him, dude.

Geez, all that from a stupid video show.

Yeah, I c- I can't believe it.

We gave you guys herpes.

I'll die if I do swim in it!

Just let us stay up a little longer, mom. Mr. Hankey's gotta show up. He always does.

What's he look like?

Love, for one thing.

Will you shut up already?! 

Dude, look! 

I don't know, but at least from now on, every time we look at the moon, we can know that Willzy-x is up there, dancing with the other zypods in his castle.

I can't take it anymore.  Why do people say "long story short"? They're not making it short, Stan.

Well... what kind of stuff does she like? Do you know?

Hey Ike, you wanna come watch TV with me?

Stan, I don't like Wendy.  All I cared about was getting an A in this stupid project!

Wait. I don't know if this is cool.

(Vanilla paste! Vanilla paste!)

Yeah, we've got school anyway.

Aww, that's some dude jacking off! 

"What I Wanna Be When I Grow Up"?

Let him out, Cartman! 

...Oh. Kenny isn't special?

Timmy.

Oh, God.  Wuh. Aah. Get out of here!

Alright.

Yep.

Okay, so how do we get my little brother back?

I've tried talking to him, but he doesn't want the lawsuits to stop. He's making too much money.

Just make sweet love down by the fire.

...Yeah. So?

Okay, I'm gonna go grab mine. I have an idea.

No no! The word, "shit".

I just want a nurection so I can give it to my mom.

Dude, you said you wouldn't say everything looked like shit!

I have to watch out for my glasses. Ow! Ow, it's so cold! Oh Jesus! 

Hey yeah! That'd be sweet! We could totally ruin their lives! 

Not-- Aw, damnit..! 

Really?

Hoh, boy. Here we go!

Aharmani Exchange?

But we don't have years! If Chef keeps this up, he's gonna go to jail forever!

Because you're a fucking fatass, that's why!

Tell us what you know right now!

We'd better get out of here. 

If she wants to be with you, how about you have her tell all these people here?

Lucky. 

Rainforests suck! I wanna go home!

Happy Easter, Jesus. 

Why are you people doing this? Why would you lie like this? To children?

Well, that's not really what you say in the commercial.

Okay, I fed the pigs. Now I definitely should water some fields... Oh wow, cool. That Jewish kid put up a sign on my farm. "Hey Kyle, really like your farm." Oh awesome!  What the hell is that? Stan? 

Dude, thanks for helping us out by joining our team.

I just didn't think it would come so soon.

The judging's almost done. You're gonna make it.  Oh God.  SOMEBODY GET ME A CHARGER!  Hold on Stan! Don't die on us!

I was... I was just going to get a drink of water.

Come on, Tweek! Blow it up!

Ike?

Heck yeah I'll visit your farm! You should check mine out too!

We... came to learn the facts about people with red hair, light skin and freckles.

Imagina-eh

But Mom, I-

You mean that you aliens actually enjoy sitting around and watching us fight and kill each other? Dude, that's messed up.

Hi, we'd like to speak to a  Professor Teabag? 

Yeah!

Okay. Here we go.  Hey! That was right on target.

Hey, shut your mouth, fatass!

What, fatass?!

Thanks dude! 

I don't care.

What's your name? 

He doesn't get cake?

Chef!

Oh my God! 

...No I won't.

But we found a frozen ice man from the past! 

Yeah, he just seems so young.

Dude, he must be loaded! What does he do?

Gross!

Please, Chef, if I don't get out of school and get my little brother back from the aliens, my parents are gonna disown me.

How are you going to try to get invited to Casa Bonita this time?

Quick, hide Butters! 

Do the right thing. Show Mohammad.  Do. The right. Thing.

I can't believe they would put a fake Mr. Hankey in a mall! If Mr. Hankey ever found out, he'd be so pissed!

Phillip, your partner.

What about Moses and Abraham?

What are you doing with cats in your attic, fatass?!

Sorry, my mind's made up.

Whoa, dude, this is our new classroom?

No they don't!

He said Madonna is an old anorexic whore who wore out her welcome years ago, and that now she suddenly speaks with a British accent and she thinks she can play guitar and she should go fuck herself. 

PewDiePie?!

Well, thanks for everything, you guys. You really helped us see how important parents are.

Because I m-I mean I really think you could have done it for about $12.50.

Hey you guys! Look what I have!

Come on, Marvin! We've gotta get your people to Marklar before the missionaries do!

with dreidel I shall play.

Then you have to tell us!

Hey, resurrection! That's what my dad needs!

Yeah, that's why we wanna have a startup company.

That can't be. My parents wouldn't lie to me.

White Stripes

That does it! CHARGE! 

God dammit! 

It's no use. There's nobody around for miles.

Whoa, dude! Who the hell are you?!

It's this place called Des Moines. It's like, lost in time, see?  Everybody looks like you do.  Fashion is two years behind, Technology is two years behind, fads, are two years behind, just like you. 

What, Cartman?

Stan? Oh. Well, no, there's nothing here from Stan, but, well, Stan's gonna come and see you real soon, I bet, Kenny.

This doesn't make any sense!

Yeah. If we're Jewish, are we gonna go to hell?

How do you murder a stuffed animal?!

You're right.  Jesus, that was fun...

Where's the heart?

Well what the hell are you doing?! This isn't gonna work now!

Dammit! Son of a bitch, dammit!  Oh, sorry.

What are we gonna do?

Ack dude! 

Ugh! 

Pleahehese! My farm hasn't expanded in three days!

Give me the drum, and you play the flute.

And in the end, I know that somewhere out there... there's the good part of Chef... that's still alive in us all. 

Come on! Let's just get in our sleeping bags and get this night over with.

Eminem, Justin Timberlake, Hootie... They all have agents. You need somebody to manage it all for you.

...Really??

Huh??

We don't WANNA go!

Ike!  Ike, you're back!

But, but we, we learned things, and took up a cause.

What?

Cartman, you fucking hunk of fat, rat-fucking hunk of pig-fucking ass fat.

Tomorrow's trial, Everyone vs. Everyone, is gonna make things a lot worse! We have to stop it!

Stan, what is going on?!

Oh, no! No!

That doesn't make me feel better! I wouldn't even be able to keep it down.

Dude, we're totally lost! We're gonna die out here!

Look!

Almost. You ready, Timmy?

Got it!

The Diamond of Pantheos.  She must be powerless now.

How?

What's going on?

What has this world come to? Where people can just... take your Okama GameSphere.

Aww, come on, you guys! It's supposed to be really cool.

I can't just hide my whole life, Butters. And besides, I have this strange feeling that one of you is gonna totally betray me. 

All that time and effort we spent helping Token and this is the thanks we get?!

That's a great idea!

If you do not accept treatment I will no longer give you money or be your friend. I will not help you kill yourself.

You're not gonna die, Kenny. Don't be stupid.

What's that?

We?

Hey, dudes. What are you doin'?

Fuck you!

Cartman, will you stop this gayness?!

What?

Is, is this? Do you think this is cool?

Ms. Choksondik stinks inside. 

Ogh. Oh cool, she likes basketball? That's perfect! Thanks, you guys!

You guys are so good you'll probably go all the way to win the national title!

I think his pants are falling down.

Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo
he loves me and I love y-

Hoh Gohod, I popped it!! Oh hit huhurts!!

What terrifying secret?

Stan? 

You misled him, fatass!

I... what? 

Alright, we don't know for sure why Cartman is ditching school, but it has something to do with abortion. That's all we know.

City kids get to go to museums for field trips. We get cow farms.

But what about the costume contest?!

Biggie. Smalls... Biggie Smalls...

Damnit, I have to have those dolls! 

Yeah dude! You'll be just like Jared!

What did we do?

Do what you want, don't have restraint.

Well what are we supposed to do with it?

Yeah. Okay, get over here, Clyde.

Come on, Tweek! He's only got one arm!

Don't let him touch you! You die if he touches you!

Did it work?

Bad.

Haha, hehahaha.

Mr. Garrison?

So... what do you do for fun?

That's a retarded idea, Cartman!

Hey. You're right, Wendy. Come on, Stan, we have to go get Cartman. 

You're wrong. If my dad says something is real, then it's real!

We don't... really know the difference.

Yeah.

And so, thirty percent of the money we make off the licensing agreement with EA Sports goes to the orphanage for the needy crack babies. Did you see the blueprints? The babies will have their own putt putt golf course.  Why does it matter how much I'm making, Stan? If the crack babies are getting a place to grow and develop, why does my salary matter?

What's "ookie mouth"?

I'm going to New York to kill the Queer Eye For the Straight Guy people!

Cartman!

But it's like eight pages long and they send me a new one like every three weeks! How can they know if I-

No, dude. That's a branch.

Sweet. How about Steve?

I don't know about this guys. I think playing hide and seek in the airport might be dangerous.

Hey dude.

Sir, we are really worried about our friend Clyde. Everywhere he goes people are telling him he had blood on his wiener.

Dude, where are we going to find a pumpkin to carve?

Tijuana, Mexico!

You bastard! 

Aw, he's dead?

Ten million?? Well that's more than the Germans want!

Oh Christ...

It was pretty fun, wasn't it?

Got 'em!

Help? How can you help?

Yeah dude!

Who are you?

What's going on?

Yeah. Come in for a minute, would you?

We're not too late! 

They on'tday?!  Why the ellhay otnay?! It ooktay ourfay ourshay to akebay this Od-damnedgay akecay, and ownay we're otallytay ewedscray!

You son of a bitch! I won't let you win! You hear me?!

We were almost killed.

That's a towel call?

Duhuhude! You barfed into the incision!

One please.

Hey. Hey, look over there, Stan. That Raisins girl is really cute, huh?  Why don't you say hi to her?  Excuse me? 

If you knew something, but, you couldn't tell anyone, what... what would you do?

Well, you are taking Chef from us. 

Hey, fatass! Instead of laying in bed eating, why don't you come and help?!

Well, sorry's not good enough! What are you gonna do about it?

You ba--! 

They didn't believe me. They thought I was pitching a movie.

I just wanted to see if maybe you want to do fingerpaints with me.

with dreidel I shall play.

Yeah? Well Butters is ten! He doesn't exactly know what's best for him and neither do you!

Dude. Are you sure that fish is a murderer? It seemed like a normal fish to me.

No you're not!  I read the brochure, Cartman! If you're under eighteen, you have to have a parent with you to sign up for the Special Olympics.

Did the tooth fairy come?

...and now I have to go home without him and my parents are going to have me killed.

Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with dreidel I shall play.

Bleuh-leuh-leuh-leuh-leuh.

Whoa! What's wrong with your head?! Why are you shaking like that?

Because we're not referring to gay people! You can be gay and not be a fag.

Ow! 

Yeah, isn't he just supposed to be learning how to read?

...What?!

Right.

What the hell are you doing, fatass?!

What? Are you crazy?

You have to stop!

Dude, what are you doing?!

Well... maybe I'll take just half a hit of acid.

Uh, oh, this, this is, the new retarded kid.

Sir? Sir, can we talk to you for just a second?

I'm thinking about it!

See? There you go again. Look at you dude. Look what you've become.

Alright, this is gonna sting for a second. 

We're sorry, Butters.  Our mind is made up.

C-Cartman?

You're afraid to do it, too.

Hey Stan. Dude, I want you to have this. It's the twenty bucks I owed you plus thirty dollars interest.

Well, that whole experience sure did suck.

You're garbage! You know that?! You're cabbage!  You've got cabbage in your muff!  You've got cabbage in your fuckin' muff! 

All right, fine. Come on, fatass! 

You made us pull you to safety because you ate treasure?! You son of a bitch!

Dude. What the hell is wrong with you?

I told him 5:30 and we gotta get going. You in?

Yeah, fine, Dad.

We don't have kickoffs anymore. 

What are we gonna do, Stan? It's, it's not like we can change the way an entire country thinks. I don't like it, but it's just the way they are.

What is that?

I've had enough of the Bible. What has it gotten me?

His name... is Steve!

Sick?

Man, this stuff is strong.

Okay, you can come with us.

Why do you have these?

Yeah. And I think I figured out why.

You didn't?

Sssss-so ...Bebe ...didn't become smart and cool? It was just her boobs?

He probably just ditched to avoid that spelling test.

Oh, so you know what mung means, hunh?

Purgatory? What's that?

Hey, are you going to come to Ike's bris this weekend?

What?

Cartman!

Dude! I hate Mr. Derp!

Well Cartman, the South lost! That mean you're our slave for a month!

Yeah.

What's the matter dude?

This... is exactly what I needed.

We're right here dude. Do you remember now?

Dude, we've arrived. We're super, awesome, and cool.

Just stick it on.

Chef, come on!

Really? What about?

How, how long do we have to take the shuttle?

Yee-yeah.

Hyeh. Yeah. Mung isn't even a word! We made it up! 

Nobody believes in you, not even my friends.

Giant douche.

Butters, Butters, I'm, I'm kind of super busy right now.

Ike, jump down, now! For the love of God, Ike, jump!

Right. Why?

Yeeah, you're welcome. I'm sorry I doubted you. And guys, I'm I'm sorry I acted like a know-it-all. 

Who's they?

He's a little young, don't you think?!

Um, sir-

We're sorry.

Go ahead. 

Cool.

Ih it's not working.

I don't have a problem.

She's not eating it, it's just coming out her backside!

My laundry detergent?

Let's just DO IT! 

What the hell are you doing, fatass?

These producers making a big holiday special!  They had me upload a video for a commercial they're about to air! They said my hash tag was awesome, and they wanted to promote it!

No, it's his bris.

Damn. That guy is the coolest guy in the universe!

Stan? Stan?? 

He still thinks he's a Vietnamese prostitute.

There is no cure, you asshole!

Hey, have you found Mr. Hat yet?

A thousand dollars.

Dude, you don't have to be ashamed or anything.

All right, I really don't want to have to do this, but... I'm not happy with the direction this company is taking.

Who's going to kill you?

Ah.

So what happens now?

Hello?

Dude, you killed your own dad, and you're worried about that?!

Dude.

You did it, Mr. Hankey. You got rid of all the film people!

This is ridiculous! Are we really going to go out there and play North Park like this?!

We have in our possession something of great power.  It is... The Lord of the Rings.

God-dammit! Come on, we can go watch it at my house!

Oh, thanks.  Dude, that new girl's into me!

I'm not better, I'm just... doing what needs to be done to make the world a better place.

You won't get more votes than us, asshole!

Hey, where's Cartman?

Yeah. Everyone thinks I'm a homo now.

We can't wait here any longer! Dude, we've gotta get him out of here or he's gonna die.

He just doesn't wanna look like an idiot, so he wants everyone to think the strike was for something. Just, just give him anything!

No, I'm not there. I'm at a hospital. I I'm hearing you in my imagination.

It was him, dude. I told you, it was Mr. Hankey!

Yeah, good idea. 

So how was that movie last night, dude?

And it actually helps the crack babies. It's like volunteering but, but we just make a little on the side.

Well look, if being around lots of cash negatively affects the HIV, then maybe...

I like chocolate milk.

But now let me tweet this for you all to comment upon.
The more connected we get, the more alone we become.If you want change like I do, and feel the same gloom,Then please follow THIS trend, #savethelivingroom

Wuh, what's done?

Where the hell is he?

Naww, let's dig up somebody else.

That does it! I know what I have to do! 

Cartman?!

Oh, Jesus!! 

Hey!  Dude. You're alive?  Come back here! 

There's four white birds!  This is what Grandma wants? She wants me to attend Jewleeard.

It was?

...Become a Peruvian flute band?

Hrrgh! 

There is a crisis in America! As families grow further and further apart-

Aw, come on!

Stop who?

You "beat off?"

Open the gate! 

Oh no, no, nonono.

Shoot it Stan.

Thank you for seeing us, Mr. Johnson. We were hoping that maybe you have some kind of key that can help us with our disease.

I'm Kyle.

You bastards!

But Mr. Hankey seemed so real...

Stop talking with your stupid hand!

That's it!

Cool.

Dude, L. Ron Hubbard was a science-fiction writer. He lived on a boat with only young boys and got busted by the feds numerous times.

Huh?  Dude, what the fuck?

No?

Shut up, Cartman!

We won! We won!

Go, fatass!

Yeah.

You get a platinum album for selling one million copies, you fat turd!

Dude, we shouldn't be here!

...No. Way.

But you need to understand: we have a whale here that needs to get back to his family on the moon.

If she holds his hand in that theater it'll be all over.

Cartman, can I give you some advice?

I only got a jar of gefilte fish.

I'm better now. 

Yeah, me too.

What??

But right now I'd say if we're gonna have a retard for a friend, I, I have to pick Timmy. Because Timmy doesn't tell any jokes.

It will.

How long has it been since you've been back there.

Really? Thanks, dude! I'm gonna go get a video camera! 

Mr. Garrison, since haiku sucks so much ass, could we go to the planetarium again?

You said we have no idea that you're never let us hurt Wall-Mart!

See ya.

Yeah, what's this about? We should be writing our monologues for Smackdown.

Well, there you go, fatass! I hope you learned your lesson.

Aaww!

What are you doing?

You bastards!

No!  I am NOT letting you go to that television studio and pretend... to care about safety and sensitivity to get a show you don't like off the air!

Oh, dude, I don't know how I can take it.

Please, tune in and help get America's families back in the living room.

Most likely.

Hey. Do you ever think maybe you shouldn't give your son coffee?

This is totally what's happening!

He did take a ship.

I can't believe it!

I have to join Jewleeard and make Grandma proud!  Tell my parents I'll call them. 

Nobody's blood is going to jump up in the air!

But Chef, you just ripped on Chinese people.

I said I wanna leave.

Yeah, and, we don't know whether or not we should care.

Your grandma left it to you! You didn't earn it!

Whoa, dude! It's the bookmobile driver!

Take a look. 

Well then we're gonna end up freezing his hellish heart with a cool island song.

Stan, we can't be seen with this nutjob!  Aw, aw, awww!

What the hell are you doing?!

Don't you have any superpowers?

Don't call Mr. Blaine a gaywad! He's a brilliant man.

"Krocsyldiphic." C  Damnit!

No we didn't, dude! No we didn't! 

Come on. Throw the football, Ike.

Oh... hey there. 

I don't believe it.

You are up there! 

We said we wouldn't be a part of this fad and look at you!

I'm never gonna win that two tons of candy looking like everybody else!

What's all that stuff?

Here! 

Kenny, all you did after the cat peed in your face was start running around in circles cheering.

I'm gonna!

Really? 

Yeah! We thought of the whole thing!

I'm confused.

Oh no! They're closed!

Oh. Well, come on, we're playing L.A. Noire.

Come on, hurry. I bet we can get to level 29! 

Huh. Whaaa?  Where are we? 

All this for a bunch of stupid movies?

"stick it inside her and pee"

I couldn't get in to see the principal, Ike.

Butters! He got a ninja star stuck in his eye, and we were taking him to the vet when you fucked it all up! Butters!

Trent Boyett is being released from Juvenile Hall.

Yeah, maybe you read it wrong.

Can you imagine it, Stan. A mind, emptied by that... thing.

I heard that!

Oh, crap, the sixth graders!

Hey, Pip. Do you wanna be on my team again?

Cartman, don't you remember the last time you had this dream?

Totally, dude, let's play Fireman.

Yeah, well people should  know that peeing in pools is  bad!

Huh?

What? 

Wow, dude, check it out! We can win Terrance and Phillip dolls. 

Dude, if my mom knew I was in here, I would be in super big trouble.

Did you do it?

Get up, fat boy! I'm gonna kick your ass!

Yes sir.

This looks like the right room.

Oh, we're just makin' a cradle out of an egg carton for our egg. We figure that way it'll be easier to keep safe so we can get an A.

Oh my God! You did lie to me.

Trent Boyett?! The kid from preschool?!

It's about time, Kenny! Did you bring the pumpkin?

Cool!

The atmosphere is oxygen-based, should support our breathing.

Both you guys, stop! Please. You're gonna make people hate us more!

We're gonna save our parents before they all kill each other!

Tango, this is Foxtrot. Are you in position?

It's perfect! I could take her to a basketball game.  Man I I don't know what's happenin', but... it seems like all the girls are... kind of into me lately. 

Don't. Touch me.

He's doing it a-gain.

What is going on?! Why do you want Britney Spears to die?!

What are you talking about?!

We're totally screwed!  They took the two best judges away!

Do you really think your civilization is better than ours?! You people play games by killing animals, and oppress women!

Dad, if the school has to pay you and Cartman $1.3 million, where does that money come from?

Them?

Why?

We know. 

Damnit, Cartman, that's not funny!

Chef, we need Butters to gain about fifty pounds fast.

Tweek. Now there's an interesting choice. Tweek has a lot of qualities that I look for in a friend.

Oh. We'll wait for you over there, Steve. We have to start fighting now.

Dude, maybe we should end this.

...Wow, that's a little ironic, isn't it?

Yeah, but you know, I learned something today. We thought we could make money on the Internet. But, while the Internet is new and exciting for creative people, it hasn't matured as a distribution mechanism to the extent that one should trade real and immediate opportunities for income for the promise of future online revenue. It will be a few years before digital distribution of media on the Internet can be monetized to the extent that necessitates content producers to forgo their fair value in more traditional media.

Thanks, Mrs. Marsh.

You have your crutches!

Please, sir. I traveled a long way to get here. He's the only person who can help me.

Yummy yummy yummy can I please Cartman's farts in my tummy?

That does it! Shenanigans!  SHENANIGANS!

Ladies and gentlemen, we have an epidemic in our country. Obesity is costing taxpayers millions, and some are taking advantage of a system that is flawed. Over the past several days I have filmed such a case, and the shocking video has been edited by my partner, Token. It is our hope that this film will cast light on a serious issue. 

Aaaaaaaa!

What? Why?

Dude, are you sure you wanna do this? Apparently this guy has a black belt in karate.

Good point man.

Aww gee, that's... so sad. Everyone should have one Facebook friend.

There's no Jews in San Francisco, you retard!

Yeah.

NO!

Somebody took my dead grandma.

Four dollars?

Oh okay, but did God sent Jesus TO die, or did Jesus just get kind of screwed over.

Hear that? It sounds like water.

Do you mind?!

Well, actually, Cartman's getting a nurection. But then, we're gonna give it you. Sooo, buck up! 

How is that spying?!

Yeh, we're running out of friends.

Because! 

He's dead, Cartman! 

No! I'm on the away team too! 

What?!

Did not!

I got it! 

Yep, all done.

Hey Blanket. Uh, look, we're goin' over to help my dad chop wood. You... wanna come with?

No, my little brother's been abducted by aliens.  It's true! Ask Cartman, they gave him an anal probe.

Yes. There's a Russian guy named Vladimir Stolfsky who's got search engine hits all over this thing.

...What the hell just happened?

Mr. Jefferson? 

Butters, there's no such things as vampires.

Oh, just this really really old lady who wishes she was still only 45. 

Kenny!

You see? And then I can take all my homework on my iPad, and swipe it over to my iPhone.

On Wednesday or Thursday?

Aw man.

God-damnit! 

Yes!

You're a dick!

Kenny, what's funnier? A giant douche or a turd sandwich?

Really?

That's it!

What??

Now do you believe us, Cartman?

You mean you can see him?  Ah-I'm not crazy? 

Dude, what?!

Oh God!

Shut up!!

Yeah. Maybe if we can get higher ratings by the end of the week, they'll let us stay on the air!

Phil Collins Hill on Saturday! You got it!

No way, dude!

How... do you make semen come out?

What are we gonna do?

Let's just get this over with!

Awesome!  Oh, crap.

Screw you guys, I'm king lesbian!

And did you see her lazy eye? You can't even tell what she's looking at.

Cool!

Yeah! Next time you make up a word, don't make up one that already exists!

All right, come on. 

Who's that?

Cartman, where are you going??

Dude, the Civil War reenactment is tomorrow! You're not gonna get it by tomorrow!

I need your help!

Oh, and what do you know about stem cells?!

The past...four nights we've tried to play, he shows up and kills us!

Yeah! Go to the tobacco company yourself!

Just admit you were lying, Cartman, so that everyone can go home!

Oh, yeah. Yeh-yeah. It's a-it's not even noticeable. 

Oh, bu- but isn't the cold air making the ball really hard? Ih-it's gonna hurt my hands.

When an artist creates, whatever they create belongs to society

Agghh!

I didn't steal anything.

Aw, blow it out your ass!

So, here we go. 

I'm declaring Shenanigans on you! This game is rigged!

Get the hell off me! You're a freak, Butters! You can't play with us!

Comments on commentators, it's all changing so fast.Playing XBox with your brother is... just a thing of the past.
Now with Ma on her iPad, and Dad trending or trying,All the family is scattered, and the living room's dying.
Because it wasn't the outdoors or church or even trips to go ski,
What brought families together most was a good old TV
Now we watch things by ourselves and just tweet what we saw.
And if you try to complain, you get called a-

Destroy it?

Will somebody shut him up?

We've gotta move away. We've gotta get as far away from this town as possible!

You were?

Hey look, Kenny's okay.

Nah, I can't. We should help look for him.

Yeah. Mine says 'Red Mega Man'.

And I got these killer Birken-stocks.

Agghh!

Aw, dude! 

No, it's great! It's just what this country needs right now!

Ike? Iiike!  Ike! 

I... I know.

I knew Kenny couldn't fit in that tea pot! 

Cartman, what the hell are you doing?!

Sure.

Whoever it might happen to be, I'm not giving him the opportunity. Tomorrow I'm going to do something. Something I've known I would have to do restore people's faith.

Check this out!

Sure you do!

Oh God! Look, I know you got Asperger's from the school and I I'm sorry. But your negativity is poison to me!

I'm going to the kitchen! This is stupid!

That's enough!

Your triangle?

Oh my God, they killed Kenny! YOU BASTARDS!

Oh geez. Maybe we let this thing get out of hand. This issue is so complicated, but... m-maybe we sh-should just let Kenny go in peace.

Maybe they took it literally when we said we wanted to adopt a kid.  Whoa! That was cool.

That's us!  "Dear MOOP. This letter is to inform you that Faith Plus One's debut album has just sold one million copies."

Noo! Wait! You can't listen to him! He's a lying deceitful monster who only wants Family Guy off the air!

Nice to meet you Starvin' Marvin.

(Yes. Yes, hurry up.) 

Frosty, Steve, whatever.

Craig, if Cartman didn't do anything, then he doesn't deserve any of the credit!

Well, he has this new teacher's assistant, and uh and they're both... totally gay.

Who's Rob Reiner?

Stan?

...I can't even get her to understand. It's like she's from another planet.

Yeah, Cartman, you're swimming around in first-grader pee.

Yeah, I think so.

Hey! I'm doing it to save little baby cows. I'm not gonna stop eating meat altogether.

You guys don't even make a six-layer burrito!

Yeah, and he was out sick yesterday too. Guys...  I think Kenny isn't here because he's at home cheesing.

Yeah dude, like, full-on. Ike saw everything. It totally makes sense now. My mom's been ordering all kinds of stuff from Amazon lately. Sometimes, sh-she doesn't even remember what she's ordered. She's probably been having sex with the UPS man for a long time.

Dude, what the hell is going on?!

Don't know, but it kicks ass.  Wow, dude, you're the luckiest kid in South Park.

I-It's good that it became something else.

He singing some new hit song.

K... what if we cover his face with a paper bag?

Dude, we're not killing Sarah Jessica Parker! 

If you want your share of the money, then you're gonna shovel snow like the rest of us!

Hehaha, heh.

Oh crap!

What's it mean?! What's it mean?!

Do you wanna bet?

No dude, screw that! Jimmy, if Cartman didn't write the joke, then definitely don't sign any patent papers with him! Just say "Cartman, you didn't have anything to do with this joke and you know it!"

I think we should bail. If we leave the group, maybe other people will get the courage to leave, too.

A woman pooping out her boobs is not good imagery!

Because I-  I... Um... because I think... they are real. It's all real. Think about it. Haven't Luke Skywalker and Santa Claus affected your lives more than most real people in this room? I mean, whether Jesus is real or not, he... he's had a bigger impact on the world than any of us have. And the same could be said of Bugs Bunny and, a-and Superman and Harry Potter. They've changed my life, changed the way I act on the Earth. Doesn't that make them kind of "real." They might be imaginary, but, but they're more important than most of us here. And they're all gonna be around long after we're dead. So in a way, those things are more realer than any of us. 

We're with you, Stan.

Yeah, good idea. 

Get him in the water!  Goodbye, Willzy-x! 

Come on! Everything's gonna be okay!  Sir! Sir!

Cartman, what the hell's the matter with you? 

Cartman, knock it off!

I can hide it!  Nobody ever has to know!  I can't ever let anybody know!

Go for it, Pip. 

No, this is his brother.

Dude! We're not digging up my grandma; I'll get in trouble.

You what?

It's okay. Everyone, it's okay. Perhaps one day, you will all understand. What I do, I do because I care about each and every one of you. 

Dammit, Cartman, you are such a fat fuck!

No- Dude, Gorak is cool because it's original. And besides, you found him.

It's okay. The curse has been lifted. 

Alright, Cartman, joke's over. 

Uhwuwhat?

Yeah, this is starting to look like something we shouldn't be any part of. Let's go play with trucks or something. 

Ready. 

What the hell?

Come on!

But everyone tries that. There has to be something you're exposed to that others aren't. Could we see where you sleep?

Dude, check it out. 

I've tried, Wendy. I've called him, I've been to his house. But since his diagnosis, all he's done is gotten worse.

Sure.  What's up?

Wait! You guys!  He's alive!  

No way!

Rotten, they're both really drunk, but the won't have sex.

Dude, what are you doing?

God damnit!

Oh. Arrggh! 

A-ah! A-a-ah! Wha? Where...? Oh. Oh dude. Oh, it was just a dream. It was all just a crazy dream. Huh, oh my God. 

Uhhhh... Yeah. 

Yeah, make up your mind, dude!

What if this is all just somebody's dream?

Come on, dance!  Daaance!  Dance, damn you!!

No it doesn't. 

Yeah, hey, do you think we'll get in trouble for watching it?

Dude, that poor kid. 

What??

Abraham Lincoln?

Wendy! You didn't!

What are you doing?

Oh God...

No it isn't. Come on, I have an idea.

He's my new pet elephant.

What's the matter dude?

"No, no, please! This time I swear I won't make albums or movies."

Gosh, thanks, Rick James.

Butters, you have to tell us what Cartman is up to!

Awwgh!

I think the rabbit just crapped on my jacket.

Ah, look, Phillip. Everyone in South Park just wants to see your serious side.

We went to a bunch of rock stars and sold them candy bars to raise the money you needed.

Ike, are you okay?  Ike?  Iiiike! 

It just seems so unfair. People won't ever even know that the wrong man is in the White House.

Yeah.  What is that?

Nope. We wanna show the world how healthy your food is. Our fat friend here is going to lose forty pounds eating at Shitty Wok.

...No, dude, that's not the trailer for Terminator 5, that really happened.

Well, we thought you went exploring and like, hunting and stuff!

You bastard!

Oh, God, what have we done?!

God-damn, it's hot out here!

It's hopeless, dude! Butters must have made it to the hospital. By now our parents probably know we were playing with weapons! We have to get rid of the evidence! 

We're thinking that a lot of people in town starting too... 

Yeah, what do you guys wanna do now?

I'm sailing away

Yeah, what a dick!

I don't know.

Who's Beth?

This is how they talk to us!  You'd better watch your mouth, kid!

Oh crap! 

Dude, those people are pissed!

It isn't that funny, Cartman.

Stan!

Oh shit! Don't let him swallow it! 

So what?

And, and hey, if for some reason Butters can't go to Casa Bonita, you can take his place.

Yeah, it's called a town.

No! Chef, they've filled your head with lies! Can't you see that??

Hey. Wuh I'm giving a speech tomorrow about people with red hair and freckles. Can I ask you a few questions?

Yeah! Isn't this great?!

That quest sucks, Cartman! Think of another one!

Cool! Thanks, Chef!

Uh Butters didn't show. You wanna go to Casa Bonita with us?

No, they're penguins! Stop it!

Yeah, but he's some kind of genius, so he's getting advanced placement in kindergarten.

Okay, fine, I will!  H-wait a minute! I don't even want one copy of Time Cop! 

You are gonna tell everyone that you lied and that we aren't a couple!

Well that goes without saying, fatass, how could she help but look at you!

Dad? Dad! What the hell are you doing?!

I don't wanna go to your stupid movie premiere!  And don't tape that to my locker!  Oh God. 

Cartman, we can't do this alone. You have to get up.

You're Stan.

Yeah, she's fatter than Cartman.

We came for our reward.

And afterwards, he'll probably have to burn his hand and bury it.

Dude! What the hell is going on?!

Awesome!

Look, this is all getting way too big! Tell the movie studio you aren't selling the video to them.

Rebecca, there's this dance, see, the South Park Elementary Bay Of Pigs Memorial Dance, and uh, now I was wondering, ih-ih-ih if you wanna go.

I wrote down... all the lyrics to the Happy Days theme song.

What?! Timmy! You've got to get off that chair!

No it's not cool!

Butters?

Hey, here comes Stan.

Ready.

Until we get people to stop downloading music for free, I say we refuse to play!

Go ahead and tell him, Cartman.

Okay, molestered, bad touch.

Wait. No wait a minute! I've got it. I've totally got it!

Okay, there. Now we can carry this egg around in this case without it getting cracked.

Hey Ike, how's it going?

Ike! Ike! Wake up buddy! Wake up! Ike, you've gotta wake up, please!  Eh there you go. That's good.  Oh Ike. I thought I lost you, little brother.

I don't know, I didn't read them!

But I...

...You're an asshole, Cartman.

Dude, this guy's trying to rook us! We can go someplace else!

Hoh!

Oh, God-damnit! That's your plan?

Come here!  You're not actually buying this crap, are you?!

Kenny will find a way.

What is that?

Who are you?

Yeah?

They'd better be done with the book reports! School starts in 15 minutes!

Yeah.

Cartman!!  You fucking fatass!

What exactly can I do to help?

Weak, dude. She only likes other lesbians?

You'd better be right, dude.

He's up in, like, twenty minutes!

What's this about you going on live television on Saturday?!

Yeah! You're a blood-thirsty succubus!

Is that what this is all about?!  You came up with this whole idea so you could get a stupid toy?! 

L-look, I was just suggesting that maybe this one person could control what he said, but just didn't, for fun.

We're gonna level up to detective!

Who the hell are these guys?

A knife.

We don't wanna be gay bashers, Chef.

Dude, you sneezed on my back!

Yeah. Do you have any "nurections"?

We're not talented?

Boring. Boring. Gay. Boring. Boring.

We'll help you look for him after the game Stan.

Um...  Greetings from Canada.  Well boys, it's aboot time we get to our hoose in Canada, isn't it?

Because you spent all of our money on those stupid rides, fatass! Now, either you're getting on a bull or I'm gonna break your fuckin' head open!

Yes, I did!

It is stupid and immature! So you got people to crap out of their mouths! What do you want, a feakin' medal?!

No thanks. We're trying to unbrainwash our friend.

Well, you're not gonna last down here either, Mr. Hankey. Now, come on! I'm not gonna let you die!

Ye-yes.

Excuse me, this isn't exactly what I had in mind!

What?! No, you don't understand-

Ike! You are no longer to watch that stupid little YouTube blogging asshole! Do you understand?! You damn kids following these YouTube commentators is bad enough, but i will not have them invading my living room!

Shhh, you're doing it again!

Huh.

Hm, I think he took that pretty well, I think.

Judas Priest.  Wow! Downloading music for free is awesome! 

Yeah!

Hey

All right, it's decided. Let's all write in "Giant Douche."

AAAAAAAAAAH!

Hey, dudes.

Yeah, they're gonna get busted again.

...But what if I do a bunch of chores around the house? Come on, you're being unfair!

We've gotta hurry, it's getting late! 

What? You mean Towelie? 

We did it guys!

God-dammit. Come on, guys. We gotta go to Butters' house.

So, just to be completely clear, now it isn't funny, right?

Oh, sorry dude.

You better! 'Cause if you don't find a cure for HIV, I will break your Xbox!

Okay ma, thanks! 

Goodbye, Ike! Be safe! I'll come find you in Nebraska when Mom and Dad are back to normal!

Nuh-uh!

You've never seen anything so ruthless!

Dammit! This is never gonna work.

It's the biggest night of the year.

Oh. Really?

You're saging these games do this on purpose?!

Thanks.

Yes.

Wait. It's okay. Look, maybe these people all turned out because they believe in saving films. Maybe they don't even care about the free hats.

I don't know.

...As soon as what's dead? 

You're watching someone play Call Of Duty and talk about it?

Ahall right!

I don't know.

Dude, just ask Chef for help. He always knows what to do.

What hope?!

Yeah, now finish 'em off! 

Dude, where in the world can Britney Spears go where nobody will bother her?

We should not be wasting time and money making sure Cartman's fat scooter can't be tipped over!

Yeah. That looks pretty good.

Uh, could you use it in a sentence?

Okay, Cartman. You ready?

Unh, that does it!

What if they don't show the Terrance & Phillip trailer at all? What if we went through all of this for nothing?

Huh? 

Ah man! I can't keep my eyes open. 

All right.  All right, I guess it's possible.

What?

Hey, wait! There are children in here!

Hello, everybodyyy.

Stan, I don't think we're supposed to be in the military base. They might shoot us.

Well sorry, dude, we weren't here.

This is gonna be awesome!

Let me ask you something, Jimmy: What happens on level 2 after you get the Ontario Nugget?!

Oh no...

"Wanted by U.S. Border Patrol"?! "Permission to shoot on sight"?!

Why are they doing us one at a time?

Kenny, who told you about this game?

Fine! 

Thank you, rabbi.  In 1973, the United States officially issued an apology to the African American community for slavery. In 1956, Germany officially apologized for World War II AND the Holocaust. And now, I believe, in 2004, the Jewish community needs to apologize for the death of Jesus.

What? Y-you want me to hang out with you?

This is it. This one's for the game.

A hot tub?!

Mr. Adler?

Dude, get away from me!

Whoa.  Kenny, you in there?

This is really gay.

Oh God!  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to-ah, I'm looking for my brother.  Ike??  What the hell is going on??

No, I'm serious. What is that behind you?

Wait a minute. There's only four of us.

You sold us out?! For an iPod Nano?!

Okay. Just be careful you don't end up naked and jacking it in San Diego. 

Well, let's just try to finish all this coffee, so we can stay up.

We have to find a way to get the word out! People need to know pushers are being hired to take advantage of people with addiction problems! There has to be a way that we can get to the news company, and sneak in and somehow borrow their TV signal. If we could disguise ourselves as something ridiculous, then-

Jews do NOT carry gold in a little bag around their necks.Cartman! Stop playing around!

Sick, dude!

Totally, dudes! I feel awesome!

That sound perfectly reasonable.

Giant Douche is your man!

Then it's not too late!

He was out all alone in the middle of the night. Mr. Jefferson isn't even home.

AAAAAAAH! I can't take it! 

Where did you hear that?

Alright. 

That's not funny.

Yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy.

I don't know.

It's just a marketing ploy by the network. Like that time they had the first male-to-male kiss with Terrance and Phillip?

Okay. Sixty daura.

Hang on, Cartman! 

Oooohh, I see. Gods and clods!

You've gotta be kidding me!

Why would the government want people to believe they caused 9/11?

We'd have to put something up on the Internet that everyone would find fascinating.

Hello, help!

So what?!

Damnit! 

Dude, look!

Wow! I guess Cartman really did take care of them.

Well, Cartman, thanks to you we don't have any money left to win the Terrance and Phillip dolls!

No, it's Cartman. Something's really wrong with him. 

You!

What was your paper about Wendy?

Didn't you forget something?

A smart one, that can do tricks.

Oh stop! We're not friends! He's the one who infected me with AIDS!

Oh.

Okay. So we put little "woo" mouths on all our heads.  And then we shoot that for one frame.

That is fucking stupid, Cartman!

Yeah.

It's Kenny's singing!

Come on, hurry it up in there! 

It's funny that something that should be completely private is put up on a Web site for everyone to see??

We have to speed this up!  Uh, can we collect our Internet money in front of you, please?

God! 

Can I just get some Goddamned tater tots?

Will you get out of my living room, please?!  Hello?!

You can get high from choking yourself? 

What the hell are we going to do??

A lot, I think.

Because, dumbass, we can dare them to do gross stuff and make them cry! What? Were you born yesterday?

Turd Sandwich isn't better than Giant Douche.

Really?

He's here! 

Rainbows are those little arches of color that show up during a rainstorm.

No, Cartman, we can't do it on Raymond again! It has to be on a current event in South Park. Tweek, do you have any ideas?

We're already doing a paper on Tweek's underpants gnomes.

His name is Steve!

That's a pretty solid idea. But who?

Chef, have you ever had something happen to you, but nobody believed you?

No shit!

You barely made it over one, fatass!

Dude, come on.

But I'll get snow on my gloves and then it will melt and I'll have wet hands.

Hey, what's that?

Do you see anything?

It's Cartman's stupid online persona!

Hey! Hey, stop it! Stop!

I'm back.

Aaaaa!

Oh. Good idea, Phillip. Let's look for treasuh.

He knew he had to take us all home, too, right?

That's Moses, stupid! 

Yeah. You're acting like a freak, Wendy.

Hey man, if you're Jewish you get presents for eight days.

Anyways, I need you guys to help me so that my parents don't realize Ike is gone.  Knock it off, asshole!

He doesn't wanna do it, dude.

Sir, you recently passed a new law allowing parents who have given their children up for adoption to change their minds. My little brother was-

Stan? 

Get outside! 

That's nothing compared to what my mom will do to me if she finds out I've been lying for five years!

Looks like we're gonna have to go to Arkansas. Come on, guys. We're gonna put a stop to Wall-Mart once and for all!

Uh thanks, Mr. Cosby!

Hey, come back! We didn't even get to do our play. 

Alright, Cartman. I'm gonna give you... a jail-time card.  You lose a turn.

I know, I know. Well, look: I'll stay over anyway so I can play for... eighteen hours, and then I'll go to the lake. 

Yeah.

Blew a funny fuse?

Dude, that's terrible!

What's the matter with him?

Dude, where have you been?

What?! 

...Yeah. Or we could just show our asses.

Which button did you press, Cartman??

We're here for Towelie, fatass!

How can you say that?

You found a network to buy it?

So how do we get to Ottawa?

Just wait till everyone sees my sweet Chewbacca costume. They're gonna be so jealous... 

Uhuh, but that's why we're going.

Not now, Cartman! I have really serious problems!

Wait!  You're all making a mistake!

It means Jehovah is going to use his powers to keep the Pharaoh from letting us go.

I know! It's so much worse than Catcher in the retarded Rye!

God-damnit! Now, what the hell are we gonna do?!

Yeah Stan, we have to go find out if Cartman's pig is pregnant or not.  See ya. 

We've got work to do Stan, I think it takes a while for an elephant to get drunk.

You know something? I think that's good. It was wrong to make Timmy a singer.

Don't be stupid, Cartman. Our teacher wouldn't be out lying in the forest waiting to kill us!

Here he comes.

Cartman, you go ahead and do the commercial tomorrow. But I'm warning you, those anti-smoking people are liars and they're bullies who will stop at nothing to get what they want, and that means they're dangerous. 

Do any of you guys have milk money I can borrow?

Cartman, you don't buy pubes, you grow them yourself!

Hello?

My name is Kyle Broflovski. My friend was raped last Memorial Day weekend. And, and I  I'm gonna help prosecute the men responsible.

Like what?

Wait!  I may not have Santa, but I do have Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo.

Hey, Craig.

Oh, my God! What the hell is that thing?! 

Whoa. Check it out, dude.  It's got little drawings on it.

You won the bet. You were totally accurate about being able to crap out your mouth, and I've just been frustrated because I didn't think of it first. I want you to enjoy that money because... you really impressed me with your insight and... I'm... proud to have you as a friend.

Come on. I'll tell you all about what happened to me. 

Sure you do!

That's more than ten bucks, you stupid fatass!

Gah, ah.  Gaagh.

Yeah, but what about all the people getting laid off from the grocery stores?  And what about all the- 

Huh? Well we don't really have that much money.

Hey! What the hell are you doing?!

This is nuts.

You'd miss the new trailer?

Dad! Somebody's at the front door!  Well am I grounded or not?!  Ugh. Fine! I'll get it! 

Come on, dumbass, you can do it!

Who are you?

Why does it matter?!

They've just gone crazy for a while. Please, mister, I have to hide my brother until they come to their senses.

He just stacked his Shapeshifter with an Elven Blade!

All right, here we go.  Since the days of Copernicus, man has dreamed of flight. On this historic day we remem- aw, screw it! 

It looks even better than their first movie, huh?

Dr. Biber said he can give me a negroplasty so I can finally look the way I've always wanted. He even took my picture and then did computer imaging to show what I would look like after the surgery. 

Ah, damn it!

Did you guys ever see that one Brady Bunch where the guy... 

'K, so then get on Facebook and fertilize my crops?

Someone is teaching our parents Minecraft. 

She's not here!

I don't know.

That's awesome!

Ok-okay.  Stan? Stan?

How does that make the world better?

What?! Aw, dude, don't say that!

In a sewer?

Do you really think that this is good for Butters? To have his face put up all over signs as the poster child for bullying?

Is that fun?

Have Butters kiss it.

Let's just get this over with, Cartman. You won the bet, here's ten dollars.

I'm sorry you guys, but there is something we can do. We can go to Canada and see the Prime Minister like I said. If we can change his mind before Christmas, then your parents won't have to give my family money.

Ugh! Those dirty liars!

God? Please, if you get me out of this, I swear, I will never play with weapons ever again.

I will if you give me money!

You bastards!

Aaaah!

You said it!

You get away from me, you crazy woman! 

That's 19 bucks, Kenny! 

What?

I don't know. It's old.

Huh.

What are you people talking about?

What?

Copy, Fox trot, let's fly in the goods Tango.

Yeah. The more distance between me and the others from Jersey, the better I feel.

We're bastards!

Two-year-olds are too old for Mr. Hat.

What's the number to dial out?

Hormones?

I can't believe I let you scare me into taking your side. You used fear to make me stop believing in free speech.

...Remember when life used to be simple and cool?

But the guy who replaced him sucks!

Shut up!

Du-hude! Your dad's a retard! 

All right! Now, come on! We have to practice! 

Dad, there is so a tooth fairy, huh?

You couldn't get both arms behind your back, fatass!

Did you send the videotape to America's Stupidest Home Videos?

Here's the control panel that operates all the stars.

Hey!

Kenny, who found the ice man?

What are you gonna do?

Mr. Hankey.

Woohoo! 

Wait a minute. I though your father was your mother 'cause she had a penis.

I'm gonna make a new costume during recess. I can still win that candy.

Yeah, and then Chef pulled up in his car. 

Gross, Cartman. Whoopee!

No, not at all. 

Hello?  Excuse me. I'm here to pick up Ike?  Uh, hello? Is Ike here?  Hello? 

We live. That's what Indy would have wanted. We just try... to live.

Yeah dude. I'm sorry.

Butters! Butters, is everything okay?

Hey. Ms. Crabtree had that little TV, for the trainng video? Maybe we can watch TV on it.

I endure what I must for the sake of all humanity.

Yuh huh!

Ah, Mr. Hankey?

Let's all try to help a little, 'cause 

Whoa! Maybe you can kiss her.

This isn't helping us, Butters!

What?

What?  You mean the missile defense program?!  Butters, where's Cartman supposed to hand over the ballots?!

Oh shut up, Cartman! Your Sweet Christmas act isn't fooling anybody!

...And see? Here's one from Butters. It says, "We can't wait to see you back in school, Kenny." And it has a picture of him and you in a little airplane! 

...What?!

Then that's it. I'm... I'm never going to get my brother back. 

Ike, I'm sorry, but I couldn't get us out of school Friday. I can't take you to Yo Gabba Gabba Live.

So then where did the eight hundred dollars we made from selling an Internet ad to Payless Shoe Source go?

All right, fine. I'll do the dumb test.

Huh??

(No! That's not what I said! Vanilla paste!)

Oh God, what have I done?!  I'm sorry. Please, I don't wanna be the vessel for the Antichrist.

This is not Mr. Hankey!  This is a fake! 

But what if we're wrong?

Yyeah well, I-I'm sorry I didn't trust you either.

Oh no...

Hey Chef.

Cartman, he's got everyone on Sony's side. We can't stop him!

Dad, will you just listen to me for a second?

If we as a people choose not to believe that Jesus is the Son of God, then we can still apologize for the brutal way in which he was killed, and take our share of the responsibility for it.

Excuse me, what are you doing to my locker?!

Ike! Go home!

I can get a better deal?

Just give me 30 minutes. Come on, Ike! 

I'm NOT a GRANDPA!

No way.

You swore on the cross, fatso!

You wanna go to Nebraska, Ike?

You're Stan? Where's Kenny?

I wanted to make sure, too.

Don't worry. We'll do this quick, okay? Just hang on, Mr. Hankey, just hang on!

We've got to get rid of them.  Nobody should have the kind of power Barbra Streisand wanted! 

It's gotta be the Komfort Inn. It's the nicest hotel in South Park. Cartman, go get your camera.

Mom, it was nothing. Mohammad just stood there and then drank some tea.

That's it? That's all they did?

We saw it on your channel.

You guys, we can't let him do this!

I'm not doing it, fatass!

Yes.  I love Cartman's farts.

Wait a minute. According to this you now own all the rights to Crack Baby Basketball and we got nothing.

Dude, we're totally fucked now!

Dude, I didn't know Token lived so far away.

Whoa, dude!

Wow! Cool!

Oh. Ike, Squirts is so much fun--

Yeah, it's fine.

They said we have to give them money that we make on the Internet.

Yeah, that was pretty good. 

I am sooo sick of that stupid bitch! Blabbin' pussy little skank! Why do people talk on their phone like that?! I can't even get a minute of piece before that bitch walks in, holding the cell phone out like this , and talking on speaker phone! Nobody wants to hear your goddamned conversations, you little bitch! You're not that important!

Give me that!  Hey! It hit her right in the mouth!

No, turdpants, it's Kyle!

And you! You should be ashamed of yourself! Don't you understand that us males are defined by our firemen?!

No, really. We've always thought you suck.

You know, I think we all learned something today. It's fine to have your own beliefs and your own traditions, but as soon as you start excluding people from your ways, only because of their race, you become separatists. And being a separatist sucks ass.

We're bored.

Buy me out?! What are you saying?! What makes you so high and mighty you can buy me out?!

You stay away from my little brother!

God, this is gonna be sooo yummy.

...Maybe. 

You still have baby teeth, Kenny?

Well, we just thought we'd let you know. See ya.

That's what they're talking about on the news!

Your husband.  He wanted that pie badly, but he knew that he was not allowed to eat it yet.

Dude, you don't understand, I'm a Jew. I have a few hang ups about killing Jesus.

So, do you uh, do you have any brothers or sisters, Natalie?

Platform 4F. Uhhh, it must be on the other side of the station.

He's back! He's back! 

Yeah. But isn't Token the only one?

Yes, but now we don't have any homework, so we can go see Timmy play downtown at Mile High Stadium

Fuck you! Why would they send you in to convince me of anything?!

Fuck you!

Cartman!

She's been built up to be sacrificed, Stan!

You don't pee in the shower, dude, that's fucking disgusting!

I can do it. It just got... look, it just doesn't matter, because it's not true.

Yeah, you're cool. And you don't say "hella."

We have to find Red and Green Mega Man for Cartman's birthday party.

No! Dude! I want the Terrance and Phillip dolls up there.

Jesus, behind you! 

Ssso it was all for nothing. The whole time I was... eating farts for nothing.

Hello.

Oh my God... Oh my God...

Hey, you're not such a bad guy after all, Damien.

He's my creature!

WE'RE NOT BEING GRANDPAS!

D-ude, I totally miffed that middle part. Did you see that?

What?

That's it.  That's how our parents broke the passcode. I never thought anyone would stoop so low!

What?? For God's sake, why??

Jimmy, did you finish your book report?

AAAAAGGGGGHHHHH!!!!! 

He'll show.

AAARGH! 

Nothing.

We got Cartman's pig so we can splice its genes with my elephant's.

Oh, so big deal, guys! Do you feel better now? Clyde's the best looking kid in the class. And then Token and Stan, and last is Francis, Cartman, and...  Me?

I'll fight anytime, anywhere!

What?

That's you, Kenny. Raise your hand. 

No, I don't! I don't care!

I think so. Is Cartman up there?

You were totally, one hundred percent right.

Dude, what's going on?

I'm not getting back in the water.

Well, Craig showed up.

It's a least a couple of hours.

The only way you can cancel it out is to get Butters to put your wiener in his mouth.

Okay.

I made you out of clay.

Dude, what are we supposed to do? We always just play with fireworks.

If only we had realized how special our time with his gigantic ass was.

I actually hugged you. I held you in my arms and, and, cried with you.

Then don't eat 14 Egg waffles for lunch, fatass!

What should we do?

I don't want to! I don't want anybody telling me how to feel anymore!

Finally!

Get it back to normal, Chef!

Bastard.

Well dude, how the hell are we supposed to play it, then?

Dammit Cartman, don't you ever learn anything?! 

Kenny?

She's gonna kill us?

There were no good times! And if he really feels bad he can just tell me himself!

Come on Kenny.

My... family doesn't celebrate Christmas.

Uh I'm trying, Mr. Mackey, I really am.

That system is totally screwed up and does nothing but wreak havoc!

I'm sorry Token, I had to tell him. His life is in danger.

No you don't, butthole! 

What's it doing?

Somebody's breaking into that Kum & Go.

She said it's fine, but that I still have to go to baseball practice tonight..

Just because two people are the same race doesn't mean they belong together, you fat racist piece of fucking garbage!

The Declaration of Independence?

Dude, Ike isn't dead. He's in Nebraska! 

How come you're not dead yet, Cartman?!

Chef.

You only need one copy, r-tard!

I don't know.

Those things are stupid, Cartman. They just stick your hand in cold spaghetti and tell you it's intestines and stuff.

Which one of us took it?! It was so long ago, I c- I can't remember.

Butters? What the hell are you doing?

It's super awesome.

Yeah. You used to sit in the living room with family and friends to hear their commentary on things. Now you can get it with a little guy in a window on the screen. Someone who just comments on stuff. I mean, really? Who would even WANT to do that?! 

So you blamed the government?!

It's true.  He doesn't care what faith you are.
Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo
he loves me and I love you
Therefore, vicariously he loves you
Even if-

Jesus Christ, dude!

But that is what happened! It is! Tell them, Cartman!

Dude! What if Cartman really does succeed? And we really do have to be his slaves??

This whole time your stupid story was just a way to rip on me for being Jewish at Christmas again!

Jesus, what are they doing in there?

No!

Here you go turkeys! 

Hey, wait a minute. How come Ike's tombstone has the Canadian flag on it?

Holy shit. Then this is all real. We've all been here from the beginning. Taking turns on the Oculus Rift headset.

You kick ass, evil Cartman!

My mom is gonna break my legs!

Hey! Look at that line!  It's way shorter.

A trampoline?

You threw it away, Cartman! It's mine now.

Yes! Yes I will!

What are you doing?

We made it, Ike. You're going to be okay. 

It was really about the most man thing I think we've ever been a part of.

Now, the next mouth.

How the hell do you have more friends than me?

Yeah, all you have to do is fart some more, Cartman! And the visitors are sure to come!

Yeah! Like Stan gives a crap if Wendy breaks up!  Stan? 

Well then,  you've got to call the jail right now and tell them that you forgive Cartman for being a dumbass!

Screw you, fatass! 

He worked so hard, come so close. Now we'll never see Kenny crawl up into Ms. Crabtree's uterus.

Uha, wa, actually, I- I can't eat beef. I have a degenerative problem with my intestinal lining, and beef really gives me gaass.

But, but he's lying! He doesn't have a conscience!

What?

Here, give me some money, Cartman!  Lend me money, fat boy!

Sshh!

...Where did you have sex with her?

I'm sorry, but right now I'm feeling-

We've gotta do something, Chef. If we don't we don't stop that network,  "shit" will become an even more acceptable word!

Well, we got some cigarettes, but we don't think you should be smoking. Each year, over a million people die of smo-

Holy crap, dude! 

(Oh, shit!)

Okay, Not-Kenny.

Cartman, open this door right now!

Get out!

What is that thing?

Would you stop scaring everyone with your dumb ass myth!

What's that?

I can see your lips moving!

Dude… Chef is gone.

What are you doing here?

Hey, uh- we were all just talkin' about how when you get better, we're all gonna go down to Stark's Pond again and go camping. Huh, Stan?

That's not being nice! That's just putting on a nice sweater!

What should we do with him?

Cartman? Your side won, dude. Why are you so sad?

Your mom... uses Chipotlaway... to clean blood stains... out of your underwear?

Aw, man.  I don't feel so good.

Well, I'm sure glad this is all over with. Let's go count our candy.

Goddammit Cartman, stop throwin' those stupid poppy-things at me! 

Hey, it looks like one of those Etheropians.

Right. But he can't live with the guilt anymore. Because, even if Jesus wasn't really the Son of God, he was still a nice guy. And he didn't deserve what happened to him in Mel Gibson's movie. I I can't sleep at night. I mean, my... friend can't sleep at night.

You don't understand! Willzy-x is from the moon! He'll die if we don't get him back, now! Willzy-x, you have to talk! Come on boy, you have to! I know you're sick, but you could do it!

Café World.

They told us that "Phillip. He's the one with talent. Just get him for Earth Day."

I am nothing, and everything.

Yeah, dude. I told you, we had bread sandwiches for breakfast.

Irene, no! Why?

Dude, everyone's leaving! We can walk right up to the tank and really study him.

Not if you... have some delicious farts for me.

So then we sit there for like, thirty minutes, because we had to wait for this couple who was running late. 

Dude, what's happening?

No! We can't divide like this!  Stan?  You're on our side, right?

Yeah. And then Craig's family came on and said Tweek was the wuss, and then punched Tweek's mom in the hooters.

Maybe you got brain cancer.

There's no way we can go all the way back. We'll never make it now!

Wait a minute! I've got it! The bullriding contest. Cartman could ride a bull, and try to win $5000.  Think about it, dude: $5000. That's 1000 set of balls. That's 3000 balls! We'd have to win enough to get the dolls!

It's great to have you back Chef!

You're gonna stop bullying.

What?

Keep running! 

He said the Muslims beat them here-  God damn it!

Dude! 

Ju-just have a little compassion, huh? I mean, everyone's gone out and bought something stupid. It's not so bad. Whichever of you guys has never bought anything frivolous, go ahead and huck the next squirrel. 

Finally!

I'm not doing it either. Kenny?

It's not Helen Hunt's ass. It's an alien space ship.

Wugh.

You just feel bad for yourself that you're in detention!

Chef, I don't feel very metrosexual.

Oh this is sweet. I've seen this episode.

Look, guys, we all have to agree on one system.

Agh!  Agghh! 

Come on you guys, we need to figure out how to get out of school so we can get my little brother back.

We want all the country to see that Kenny is alive, and in pain!

Hey, yeah!

Look, we already have the guy's blog. Maybe we can find an address and check it out on MapQuest.

Oh for the love of God!

We'll just have to keep throwing jabs to win the fight.

Totally!

Dad? 

Yeah. This does seem really familiar.

Stan, this has gone too far. People are going to get hurt. What you started is way out of control.

Cartman got his, then Kenny. What if tomorrow Stan says he got his and I'm left out? I might not even get to be their friend anymore.

Sweet!

That's the NFL!

'K go! 

Impress Wendy??

OOOOOHHHHH MY GOD!!

Hey, so... do you wanna be Facebook friends?

Mom, Dad, can I go with the guys to see the Raging Pussies?

Do you pee in the pool?

You're having dinenr with his family? What kind of family has a kid like that?

Do you think they're gonna pissed at us for lying that they molested us and sending them all to jail for ten days?

Shut up about Jews, fatass! You don't know anything!

This is it, Stan. If you strike this kid out, we all get to go home.

I can't keep doing it, Wendy. I know he has an illness, but goddamn, it uh, it's like being around a black hole that just sucks the life out of everything.

They told us he has a m-muscular disease. An and, that ...and that he, he might die. 

Ah. Oh, now I already told them.

Aaaarrghhhhhh!  I'm not one of them! Do you understand me?! You'd better get that through your fat head! I will never be one of them, and if you say it again, I swear to God, I'll smash your fucking teeth in! 

You must have a mom.  You mean she doesn't live here, or she's dead, or what?

No, dude, you're supposed to put their hand in warm water and it makes them pee.

Grrhh, whatever. 

Come on, dude. I wanna get out of here.

Kenny! Noooooo!

If we're playing outside he shows up completely wasted and, and screaming how the government is following 'im.

Totally!

Nope.

Dude, this plague is spreading like wildfire! 

Cartman?

What are you doing?! 

Why?

Dude! Where have you been? I've been waiting all afternoon.

Bye, Mr. Hankey. See you next year.

...What?

Kyle.

Oh yeah.

I swear

Yeah. That'll make 'em look stupid!

Behold! Mr. Hankey! 

Dear Mr. Castro:  I am an eight-year-old American boy who lives in South Park.

It's okay, Ike, you're going to be... okay.

Hey! We should buy Ms. Ellen Valentine's Day presents. 

Sounds good.

Wagh.

I don't know. But there's gonna be lots of food, and a band.

Jimmy, are you sure?

Yeah, I know, but I have to-

And that's why I feel like you guys are more than just friends. You're my family.  Except for Cartman.

No more Barbra Streisand, everrrrr!

Okay, Not-Kenny.

Argh!

...And if you look here, you can see how David Blaine performed the miracle of being frozen in ice at Times Square.

Well, she's not here! That's just great! Thanks a lot, Stan! You're gonna get me busted again!

You're trying to confuse me now, aren't you?

Let me guess: you wrote the joke, and Cartman just laid on the couch eating Twizzlers.

What "agreement"?!

Hey, look, there's Wendy Testaburger.

It's too late. The treatment would have killed it all.

Officer Barbrady, I would like to reinstate my previous Shenanigans! This whole carnival is a rip-off!

Yeah. He was doing their voices and pouring tea for them.

We're good, Scott. Stop bugging us. 

Ask her if we get the watch right away.

How... How did this happen?  Mom, Dad? Why are you shopping here?

Dude!

Why'd you call us?

What's going on?

See? You can still make it for the end of the party.

Then he's perfect for us.

It's okay. You don't have to feel alone anymore. 

Butters, what the hell are you doing?!

We're in business!

Just let it go with your fucking balls, you fucking asshole!! Your friends have been in danger and all you care about it this stupid bet! Well I've decided, Cartman, even if we had a bet, that I am never sucking your balls,  you got that?! They can throw me in jail for the rest of my life, but I am  never going to suck your balls,  never! So  there!

DUDE! Did you just shit your pants?!

Are you sure this is where they said to be?

Guys, I think we should bail out of this right now!

Yeah. I've changed mine three times already 'cause it itches so much.

All right, let's just say all the bad things said about Mr. Jefferson are lies! Let's say the police department does just go around spending their time framing people for crimes they didn't commit!  Let's say it's all made up, and Mr. Jefferson is just a nice guy who's trying to be a child because he never got to have a childhood. Well that's fine, except for that he HAS children now! And when people have children, they have to grow up!

It looks like we're completely sealed in.

Ohh, right, you're supposed to pull and master-benate your wiener really fast.

Yeah. I think maybe everything is gonna be okay now.

Hell no! 

Oh no. Butters!

We don't have time for this.

Cartman, stop it!

All right McNuggets!  Did we pick the right rooster or what?!

You aren't welcome here, Triceratops!

Dad, can we go home? All you ever do since you got this car is drive around and show it off! 

Wow!

Dammit Cartman! I gave it to you so you would shut... up.

Yeah, they do!

No way! 

But... isn't that, kind of, lying?

Did you see it?

I am taking it personally because Cartman is a retard! Just because he hit his head and went into a coma doesn't mean he's a- Wait, that's it. If I want people to listen to me, I just have to be as stupid as Cartman.

Hey! Heeey!

Okay. since my dad's a lawyer, he says we can use any of his books we want.  Who wants to read them? 

Certainly.

Uh you did what? 

Gah! Just leave me alone! 

Yeah. I'm sure whatever that Super Adventure Club does is pretty tiring.

Don't worry, Ike! The strike will be over soon! 

What?

Anthrax?!

Wait! I don't wanna know that!

Oh, yeah.

Fine! 

We didn't think that by pretending you didn't exist, you would really change, but you really have.

Well how come Kenny's family eats frozen waffles for dinner and has rats on the floor, and we have a big house and lots of food?

Dude, it's totally fine.

Dude, I'm Jewish. I have no idea.

Dude, my brother's in Milan. There's nothing I can do.

...Yeah, and dressing up and running around at night is faggy anyway.

'Cause, dombass, scary monsters don't eat big fat smelly bitches!

Original zombie? Well, how the hell do we know who the original zombie is?!

How much do you wanna bet?!

Alright, fine!  You're the spokesman, Cartman! But you'd better not screw it up!

I don't know. We just have to get it to town and let them figure out what to do with it.

Like what?

Cool.

Dude! I've never seen Cartman care so much about something.

Don't you get it?! You can't have any Trapper Keepers, fat ass!

Aw crap! 

Can we please just try and talk to him?

What are we supposed to do with him?

Oh no, I d- I don't want to be a bother, I uh-

This is what God told us to do!

I'm leaving right now! 

God, I hate the holiday season! 

Gross! 

...Sorry

I can't watch the meteor shower with you, Kenny. I have to go to Jewbilee.

If you really think every kid in America should see your anti-bullying movie, then why don't you put it on the Internet for free?!

What?!

What are you doing?

Cartman, shut up. We're concentrating. 

Hey, uh, does anyone know who that guy is?!

Hey, uh, Jimmy, can we talk?

No dude. Because since you got your feelings so hurt for being ripped on, now we think you're a pussy.

Just read the sentence.

Aw, come on, dude! All you've done for the last four days is mope around! You might as well hang out with those Goth kids who dress in black and talk about pain all the time!

You bastards!

Yes?

Kenny!

Hey, why don't we watch some of those porno movie thingies?

Yeah. People are willing to pay big money to see Kenny do this stuff.

Kenny?

Yeah, we got him!

This place is rad. Look at all the trees and stuff.

Why, Mr. Farkle?

Why is that bad?

Red Robin can be rented out, for wedding parties. If we all chip in we can pay for the deposit to have the wedding party there.

We have to talk to him!

All you ever do is talk about your balls!

But it's... it's not true they... have no souls. 

No.

How much?

Aw, sick! 

Stan?

Wow, Cartman. You look... different.

Seriously.

How could we know she would... Aw we suck so hard.

Why the hell would they want that anyway?  Episode I sucked balls.

So what number was I??

This is where we all stand in a circle and pray to Moses for guidance during Jewbilee.

What?!

Damn, you sound pretty sick. Maybe you should go back to the hospital.

Get up! You have to fight! 

It belongs with its family!

I caught it! I caught it!

Dude, it can't be cooler than mine.

Did you guys hear that?! A hundred thousand dollars for a picture of Britney.

Why?

Maybe we should get out first. See if we can find a way out and then come back for him.

Stan can't come.

W-well, we've heard that she's...

No, it isn't!

Aaaggh, God.

Dude, I think you're being followed. 

I guess so. She's, like, his first real girlfriend ever.

Well, it looks like she's not going to show up, Stan. Let's go look for the visitors now.

How?

Well yeah, but not if your decision is for Turd Sandwich! What the hell is wrong with you?!

You can? Awesome!

Mom, Dad, what's "muff cabbage"? 

Ma'am, we are a very important talent agency. If your producers knew you were forcing people of our stature to the back of the line, well-

Don't worry, dude. You're gonna do great.

He didn't even seem like Chef. He seemed like a empty shell of a man.

No way, dude, then I'd have to suck Cartman's balls

Forget it! They can't hear us!

You don't wanna go back to stinky Romania, do you? It sucks there.

Hey Kenny.

Oh my God!

Huh?

You probably should come clean and tell the truth. Did you superglue your bracelet?

This is it. 1421 Plaza de Estereotipo.

Serves you right, Cartman!

Cartman, what the hell are you doing here?! You quit!

Yes, people can get hurt. That's how terrorism works. But if you give into that, Doug, you're allowing terrorism to work. Do the right thing here.

Cartman, there are people in the world who really have Tourette's Syndrome. This isn't funny!

Hey look!  It's working.

They're gonna take The Lord of the Rings from us.

Do you think kids in every town have to deal with this crap?

What the hell are you doing?!

You cheated, Cartman!

He's not a douche! He talked to my grandma!

Dude, that new kid is such a douche!

What are you talking about?

You were sticking these in your ass, Cartman?!

Yeah. No more getting pushed around by fourth graders! 

Who?

You got Randy Newman to do the theme song. You're not trying that hard. Token, you're a good kid. How can you sit there and collect money on a show that's about a, about a fat child killing himself?? Where's your sense of shame??

Where... is... the Internet?

Wait! 

Bitch.

Oh my God, dude!

You said "fuck you" to my face, Stan.

He's not my brother!

Whattaya say, Cartman?

I think Clyde is kind of cool, but Craig is definitely cooler than Clyde.

Alright, alright! If it means that much to you, take the stupid triangle!

Whoa, dude!

Cartman was right! The holiday season is for idiots!

I dunno!  Try "strangetamer."

Calm down, Cartman.

Are you in?

Really?

That can't be true! My parents wouldn't do that!

Really?! What's there not to understand?!

"Dear Mommy and Daddy: I am running away. I am sorry, but I can no longer handle the monotony of middle-class life. Everyone at school is a fucking idiot, and if one more person talked to me about that Susan Boyle performance of Les Misérables I was going to puke my balls out through my mouth. I love you all, but I have to move on. I'm going to Somalia to be a-" to be a pirate?! Oh shit!

Okay. We've got $15 between us. That means we get nine balls to throw.

Dude, not now! 

Butters, do you really think it's fair to lie like this?! Let me tell you, if you don't have the-

Mung's good.

Well, all I can say is, he's better have Nintendo.  Well, here's Kenny's house.

Dude! 

Do you kow where your doll is?

No, no, you... you wrote down Turd Sandwich.

Yeah. And then we can try the football field. 

Yes, but he thrives on that.

Not Cartman, he gets to be on TV anyway.

Uhhh, how d- how do we start this thing?

We can't be outdone by the kindergartners!

Some hadka fish, some gafagga...

Oo whataya mean?

Off the air? But... we're just going to try to get the Mohammad episode pulled.

Cartman, you dumbass! You can't get a new one!

I'm telling you, it's okay. Maybe you should ask the Lord for guidance.

That is Craig. 

Yes!

We do?

Okay.

What the hell is that lady talking about?

I'm showing her.

Dude, that's all pee!

Yeah.

You're lying!

Twenty-two point three years. That's how long it takes for something tragic to become funny.

I swear, Stan.

Yeah, dude. It looks riveting. 

Oh, hi Dad.

Yeah, I've gotta get back to Connecticut.

Why do they even allow those things in stored?

I don't really see the fun in...  ...not trying to kick that game's ass once and for all!

All right!  Dad, I can play! 

Wow, look at all these people playing right now.

Mr. Hankey?

NOO!  Noo. No. Awwh.  Aw no...

Yeah dude! We are the Avengers!

Aw dude, this is really hard.

Y-yeah, but… the color of someone's skin doesn't matter.

A... curse word.

Ike, I didn't tell on you, you got busted by the hallway monitor.  Okay, okay. I did have something to do with it. But someday you're gonna realize it was for the best.

I... don't... have... any... friends...

But don't tell anybody we have them.

Kyle Broflovski.

That's it, Stan! I'm not sitting through a whole movie with you! 

Dude, that was Star Trek again.

Ike, I just want us to be friends again.

You sure you don't wanna back out?

Huh?

What's this all about, Cartman?

What have we done? 

How is that gonna help?!

You put a guy's wiener in your mouth, that makes you gay, stupid!

So, how are things going at Cartman's theme park?!

Well why not? You want us to get AIDS?

What the hell would you know you fat sweaty Mongoloid, you never get higher than a 'D'!

My Dad says he can't live here anymore.

Kenny! 

Awesome! We get powers?

...french fries...pizza...pizza...pizza-french fries... I wonder where our parents are.

You know God-damn well what! Now get outta here!

Okay, okay, you can have your powers back.

It's all right. He can't kill us unless we agree to duel. 

You're a fat skank, Mom. 

We don't have respect for Mr. Garrison.

There.  I think we got it.

Dude, go to Hell!

Because, retard, you're dumb enough to buy Scott Tenorman's pubes for ten dollars!

That isn't gonna work, dumbass!

...Uuh, can I talk to her?

I'm sorry, Stan. I'm sorry. This whole war has just got us all so screwed up. I just want us to be playing Call of Duty on the right machine.

If someone says they saw a Sasquatch, they are either lying or they are stupid. Now stop lying about a Jewpacabra before stupid people start believing you!

They're just taking Indiana Jones and they're...  they're raping him! 

Alright, what is this all about, fatass?!

You know, I didn't even get home until 2:30.

Stan, you can't let that Tad guy get to you. Screw him, dude.

Come, see him with us.

Mph. Okay, Mr. Hankey. We're out. How are you doin'?

Yes, I did!

I have no idea.

Why? 

Give it up, Kenny! You're not gonna win that costume contest! Your costumes always suck. 

I know, dude! Let's get the hell out of here! 

Stan! 

Oh, you're just saying that because he brings you candy.

What did you do?!

Cartman was visited by aliens again last night. And now it's like we're living a repeat of a previous day.

You're right, Stan. My Grandma isn't floating around, judging me and watching what I do. She's dead. Dead and gone forever.

Yeah. Do it, Cartman.

Why?

Don't you just feel a little bad for Clyde?

They're out fishing with Kenny.

They're... they're bastards.

That's great, Butters, but we're not playing Detective anymore. We're playing laundromat owners.

We're his oral report buddies.

How are we supposed to name our startup company if every name is already taken?!

Yeah. 

I think so.

Sorry, sorry. You know how after we spent the night at Kenny's house and-and you and Cartman got sick with chickenpox?

Nuh uh! It's "Whoever denied it, supplied it!"

All I wanted was to play one level of Call of Duty and you know what Ike told me? He said the living room was for old people.

Hey. Do you live here?

Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,

See?! That sucks, dude!

Dude. What's wrong with you?

Gay-ass. 

Meh? Ike, we have a whole day to play XBox! Mom and Dad are leaving!

This part kinda sucks, Kenny, but don't screw it up. 

Other than his monstrous size.

Uh okay! No problem! 

I don't know if that's gonna be too easy. 

Noo! No.  Noo! 

All right. Mr. Garrison, have you ever had a friend who got a new girlfriend, and then stopped being your friend, and it pissed you off?

Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,

I'll kick you in the nuts, Stan! 

What do you mean?

Rebecca, in public school,  we select our... own mate.  In public school, men and women get together. Make each other happy.

Naw.

Me, too. He sucks.

What happened? 

Stan!

You're freaking sellouts!

Ungh, I can't find the word "queef" anywhere! 

I know! But that doesn't matter any more! These kids don't wanna play the game, they just wanna watch people on YouTube play it.

I'm not going in any meat locker so you can trap me!

Okay. N-no, ah I don't want that much responsibility-bility. Here, you hold on to it, Kenny. 

Wow, that'd be cool.

You can't do that! 

All right, all right, I was not responsible for 9/11!  God-damnit!

Sure. Sh-sure, Mr. Hankey.

What?! You said we had plenty of money, Cartman!

How do we know which one to use?

It's just wrong, that's all.

Cartman? What the hell?!

Wow! I guess reading really does suck ass!

Shit!

You didn't think of anything, Butters! Guys have been doing what you're doing for years! You're nothin' but a common pimp! 

Well, we tried, dude. If anyone else in this craphole hates Americans, we'd better just leave the goat and get back to the plane!

The only reason we scored high was because we took the answers out of Garrison's desk! And you know it!

Now, that's what I call a sticky situation. 

Holy crap!!

Wow! Cool!

Well sure.

Hmmm.

Yeah dude, don't get us killed too. 

What's wrong with his face?

Really sorry about all this, dude.  So what the heck are we gonna do now? Muhammad isn't safe here.

Watch out for ground eels! 

Well everyone has already seen it; nothing we can do about it now.

This is amazing! But wait right here. I've gotta go tell my friends about this! 

I saved up enough to buy M-80s this year.

Hey! Hey!  Who the hell told you to put this thing back up?!

Aw dude, don't do that. That's gay.

We're ignoring him.

I don't speak Hebrew.

Nuh uh.

Right, then it was "Imagina-ation, Imagina-ation. Imagina-atio-on" 

Nuh, it's more important than that. Our school is putting on a big show for Earth Day, and we promised people we could get you to perform.

Dude, my mom won't even let me have a hamster.

Yeah, we're all set.

What?!! Sick, dude, I'm not kissing a girl!

You aren't gonna get away with this you stupid asshole! 

All that hard work.

You unbelievable son of a bitch. You never cared about the Muslim religion. Or the safety of people in America. You just want Family Guy off the air!

This is fucking retarded!

The-that's not the right way to look at it, I-

Butters! No!

Well, unfortunately for us, he's now on the other side! We are out of options!

Dammit!

Well, I don't know...  and I'll bet Cartman doesn't know either!

Eh... hey, Cartman?  You really don't care that you can't go?

...We actually spoke—to the Brian Boitano.

Got what?

Four weeks we gotta do this?

What's the big deal? Don't you understand what ignorant prejudice like that can lead to? I have to disprove Cartman's hateful rumors! Do you know any red-haired, freckled kids?

You guys, maybe we should come clean right now and tell everyone that it wasn't the tobacco companies that made us want to smoke.

There he is!

Hang on, Willzy-x. Hang on, buddy.

I've almost got it!

I'm a hundred percent ready, coach! 

You're such a dumbass, Cartman. 

Arrghh!

God-damnit dude, your mom and dad want you to come home!

No.

Sure you will, Cartman. Sure you will.

Wha-? Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You Bastards!

Kenny, aren't you a little young for this?

He did?

Come on Stan, don't you even know where you would go?

No... No, this isn't possible.

Yes! 

I don't know. 

This is how I look natural.

Oh my God...

I'm sure. Abe Lincoln was right: I don't wanna find out I'm good-looking and become a total shithead when I grow up.

Me too. It was sweet.

Yeah. They've kinda killed Kenny -'s look-alike. You bastards!

Oh Jesus Christ, I had to see it to believe it! What the hell are you doing?!

He's right. It's just a spook story.

We don't have a fifth member, Cartman!

Yeah. We're gonna call you Fartboy from now on.

Dude, why'd you make that deal? If we're out buying tampons, we'll miss the trailer anyway/

You've got to stop, Dad. If the South wins, me and Stan have to be Cartman's slaves!

Hi Mom, Hi Dad!

Dude, I think it might be best for us to never piss Cartman off again.

We have to go see Mr. Hankey at the mall, Cartman.

Why don't you just sneak in your mom's closet and get a picture when she's changing clothes?

Can we please go faster?!

What do you wanna do now?

Okay okay... I love having Cartman's farts in my tummy. I love it.  I love it sooo sooo much.

What are you talking about, Stan?

What's in it for us?

This tape makes people freak out wherever it goes.

It doesn't prove anything!

The base where you're from and where our Okama GameSphere is! 

Hang on, Blanket! 

No I'm not! God damn it Cartman, you're not gonna kill me off again!

Anything in the basement, Jimmy?

But it's gotta be perfect. We're trending well, but we need to attract more followers who want good old family values.

No, we really want nothing more to do with these people.

Cartman?

Sir, just think about what you're doing to free speech!

Goddamnit, you know I don't carry gold in a little bag around my neck, Cartman! Whattaya want from me?!

No. This is taking forever.

Stan, you're just jealous of that third grader and you think Wendy's gonna go for him unless you start singing and dancing too.

...That is so missing the point.

Huh? Why not?

That was cool!

You know what's goin' on. It's Smackdown tonight. Which means we might have to fight each other.

Excuse me, is this really what you think she should be doing right now?

That bitch!

Come on, Mary!  Push!

Okay, Mr. Hankey!

I'm sorry, Kenny!

Eric Cartman can never know about this.

Who confessed? That doesn't make any sense.

Just let us see your iPad, Cartman.

Wait. Wait. I think I can explain this whole thing. Marklar, these marklars want to change your marklar. They don't want Marklar or any of these marklars to live here because it's bad for their marklar. They use Marklar to try and force marklars to believe they're marklar. If you let them stay here, they will build marklars and marklars. They will take all your marklars and replace them with Marklar. These marklar have no good marklar to live on Marklar, so they must come here to Marklar. Please, let these marklars stay where they can grow and prosper without any marklars, marklars, eh or marklars.

Hey! My dad's pretty cool, too.

Huh?

That wasn't the Mayan apocalypse, you racist idiot!

You know why! Because we're trying to keep our parents from watching murder porn!

Yeah, Jimmy's right. I know we can come up with way better ideas than Craig.

What kind of protection?

Fuck you if you're in on this.

Gods and clods?

Well, guys, I guess we're going to Canada.

No, he sure doesn't.

Uh, alright then.  Oh, would you look at that? I've got a corn on my ankle.  Now where did that one come from? That's the fourth one I've had- 

Fatass.

D'awww sick! 

Oh is, is this beef?

Yeah! You get out of town!

..Oh.

We don't know. They lost all contact with him.

I'm gonna shove that thing up your ass!

I got beat up at school... for being different.

Cartman, stop being an asshole! 

You hate Butters.

Why do you put them into people's asses? Are you planning some kind of alien takeover?

Do you mind telling us what the hell is going on??

No, that... I thought that was a lot.

Yeah! Timmy's probably back in third grade right now living it up!

No! 

That's it Cartman, I'm outta here!  Chatroulette is no way for me to find new friends! 

I don't know what else to do, dude. No matter what I try, me and Ike just seem to drift further apart!

Whoa. 

He's here!

Dude, I just found out that everybody pees in pools. Why would I go back?

Step on it, Bill Cosby! 

I'm confused. Did Ally Sheedy take that personality test?

He didn't do anything. He was always with his new girlfriend.

I said, 'Larry King won't grant me three wishes.'

Dude, this is probably the best episode they've ever done!

Fuck off, Cartman!

How can I not be nervous? Trying out for the All-State team has been my dream for years.

I need to get a nurection for my dad.

Bye-bye seeme mama.  Ah, I'm gonna take him up to the bathroom to get washed up. 

Hey, we should start our own Cirque du Cheville.

Huh??

Oh no.

Can we get going now, please?!

Hello, I'm Kyle's cousin Kyle.

Stop. It.

Well, you have to hit it softer!

Wow, then you should get money for it!

Ah I guess.

Here, give me that.  "I am Bumbly Wumbly. I live in the pond."

Ike, you need to have a life. Have fun. Then ruin it by having a serious relationship. 

Goddammit! God dammit! 

Where's your present, Cartman?

I don't really care, dude.

You don't like anything, Cartman! 

Yeah! So you gotta bust out of here.  So we made you this cake.  There's a ailnay ilefay inside of it.

Singing a Christmas song isn't gonna get you nice deductions, Cartman! Don't forget: it's because of you that Santa's sleigh got shot down!

Hey, that's a great idea!

We're not gonna hurt her, we just need some of her blood.

What are they doing in there?

No, I don't! The decision was overturned. 

God damn it Cartman!

Gahhh! 

No, No thanks, that stuff tastes like pee.

What? You want me to lie?

Dude, I don't think this is very sturdy. 

It's just me.

Woohoo! Yeah!

No.

Dude. I don't know if I'm going to like the new Eric Cartman.

You're just jealous he's a better psychic than you.

Okay, turn it on.

Come on, fatass!

Mom, Dad, can I have money to buy Chinpokomon?

Cartman, what the hell is this?! 

With his power, I can finally make the earth a better place for the Jews!

Y-you alright?

A hundred thousand dollars?

Chr, what could you possibly have in your room that could change the outcome of the election? 

Yes, yes, hello? Is this Mr. Su-gi-yama with the Japanese space program?  How much to take a whale into space?  Nu-no, we don't want you to eat the whale, we want you to send it to the moon. How much? Jesus Christ! Uh hang on.  Hello? Jimmy, any luck at the Chinese Embassy?

I looked on the known species webpage. There's no animal called a 'Jewpacabra' mentioned anywhere.

Dude, did your dad know that the show was being broadcast live?

Yeah, you're from China.

Yeah. We've been playing with firecrackers our whole lives.

Is it illegal for Jewish people to eat Christmas snow?

I know.

Yeah, so?

Cartman flooded Beaverton?!!

I... because the world is at peace. I must endure.

Gee, you seem a little stressed, Mr. Garrison. Why don't you try some Ritalin? 

It's like the Disneyland of Mexican restaurants.

Mr. Hankey!  Mr. Hankey?!  Mr. Hankey?

Yeah.  Oh, here he comes.

Nothing. 

The TV left.

Hey Cartman.

Well, YOU don't, because you're a non-caring asshole, Cartman!

Cartman, I'm going to tell you something, and I need you to believe me, even if it seems impossible.

What?!

Goddammit, Cartman!

Stop it!

I don't know where Cartman is. I think something took him away.

There's really people out there without a Facebook friend in the world? That's so wrong.

Really?

Oh well, at least as president you can run the school the way you want.

Google him. He's this guy from Sweden who has over 30 million YouTube subscribers. We didn't even know, but he's a bigger celebrity to kids than anyone. It just seems so lame.

It's the only way to prove to them that you're real.

Who wants to tell him?

Cartman, do you even know what's going on? We went to Imaginationland, terrorists attacked it, and now the government is about to-

Dude, it's a Peruvian flute band.

Oh my God. This is like a third-world country.

I need to book one trip to the moon, please. Right away.

Shut up Terrance, we can geneti-cal engineer anything we want.

Phew. The one videotape is sought after indeed.

No, no, no! Don't become an angry mob!  The last time we did that we killed Jesus!

Fine, I will! 

Please...

Fuck you!

Wow! 

Whoa, look at that.

Then saw off the arms and legs. 

Aw, screw it; I'm too confused. 

Well all right, we'll see you on Saturday, guys.

But, everyone thinks I was responsible for 9/11.

I won't believe it! I won't! I have to ask my mom and dad! 

Cartman! 

Quick. Hide. 

It says you gotta check it for holes or tears.

Listen, doucher! Our parents are gonna kill us, and you, if they found out that we bought these!

All right, let's see.  Dammit Kenny, that's not what she said!

Well, I was just digging around, and I was all like, 'dude, I found this triangle' and my friends were like, 'dude' and I was all like 'dude.'

No Grandma??

You don't know what you're talking about, fatass!

Just stop it!  Stoop iiit!!  There's a logical explanation for that.

Yeah... but doesn't it seem like we got out of the White House pretty easily? I mean, it seems like it would be pretty hard to escape from the White House with everyone chasing you, and we just kind of... ran out. 

No, we're gonna get creamed!

Just go behind a tree.

There's a bunch of zombies here!

You're doing the right thing, Stan. Don't you feel like you're a part of something now?

What kind of extremists are these? 

I didn't see you complaining at the time, fat boy!

Thanks, everybody. I'm sorry I got a little crazy there.

The Tale of... 

No, she wasn't!

Yeah. They think they're so cool.

Why? Why, Mom? Because if I do something bad will happen to me? Because if I do your God might not shower me with his blessings of infected hemorrhoids?

Two years?

It's not new!! I'm gonna look "shit" up in the encyclopedia and prove it!!

Oh no! No!!

Yeah. I guess that's the point. I don't think we're gonna understand. Maybe this IS all the beginning of a new art form. YouTube celebrities are only getting bigger. And what's great is that these people are inventing themselves, instead of being marketed and shoved down our throats.

A band! Holy shit, Stan! Didn't you say your dad knows somebody who knows Lorde?

Fine,  then we'll shut our cable off altogether!

Aaahh!

The last commercial break is starting!

Right. But in the 1340s people in England stopped calling it "skite" and started calling it "shit." The same year as the Black Plague.

We beat Close-up Animals!

Just tell us where Lemmiwinks is being held prisoner so we can kill this stupid rat!

Yeah!

Yeah. I feel great!

Come on, Steve, you're going to Des Moines!

We're nine.

What?!

We just wanna go home.

Hey, Stan. What did the doctor say?

Well, let's see how he likes the icy blasts from my nunchucks of Sokuromoto! 

Right. 

All right, come on guys!

How many friends do you have, Kenny?

It's that ring. Somehow, putting on that ring has turned Kenny into a boring turd.

Dude, did you fart?!

Dude! I'm glad to see you. You would not believe the night I had.

What? Are you sure?

I know it's hard to think about, but you have to be strong. Remember how that movie made you feel.

Country Kitchen Buffet?

You what?!

I am sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Keller, but I'm afraid your daughter Helen still cannot see, hear, or speak.

No, I think it's something you have to try a few times. Until you get it... right. 

Haaah! 

This is the worst day of my life.

Go, dude, go! 

You sit- 

You bastard!

Yeah, dude!

Dude, look at Bebe.  Something seems different about her.

Not him!

No, Muslims can't show an image of Mohammad.

Uch, I didn't think there would actually be a leprechaun! And I still don't! Why would a leprechaun be warning us of a terrorist attack?! There's another explanation for all this.

It's not a presentation, it's a hate speech! People aren't creeped out by gingers!

Me?? Dude, I've been here since the beginning!

Hey, look! It's snowing! 

Sorry, dude, but this fruity little club isn't taking our friend!

I guess it... feels great. Thanks. 

Dude, screw this! I don't wanna see anymore!

It's not cool! Ike isn't old enough to understand.

Cartman?  Cartman??

Hello?

Come on, Stan. We're gonna play dodgeball.

Dude, I figured it out.

I'll meet up with you guys in a little bit. I-I wanna hang out here some more.

Yeah.

So what do we do?

Then why the hell do they call it "veal"??

We'll get back in time for a Christmas adventure.

Well, looks like everything turned out alright for them.

Those contorting Romanian chicks rule.

They found the butt-face people's son, Butters. They're gonna have a big reunion at the milk company!

Oh wait. Hey AWESOM-O,  I'd also like some celery sticks chopped up two inches long, with peanut butter and raisins on top.

How many ball does that get us?

Alright guys, listen up! This may sound a little strange, but, the whale, at the Denver Sea Park, is going to die, unless we get it to the moon,

Uuuh, Cartman. We know how you can get $3000.

Yeah, let's go. 

Who is Saint Peter?

Charlie's right! I'm not gonna let some fake Mr. Hankey spoil my holidays.

Aw, God-dammit!

Yup, he's in here. 

...Jesus?

Oh no, dental floss, what will I do?

You're too fat to be Jesus!

He's a magician named David Blaine, dude. He kicks ass.

I am no longer an XBox guy! I let my friend get grounded, but today I will give him a PlayStation!

How can we be passé? We're only in 4th grade.

Ike. Ike!  It's over.

Moving in?!

No, Ike! You can't come to school with me. 

You guys, that's not cool. These people have nowhere to go.  They don't have food or shelter. We have to do something.

HAAAAH!

Check.

Hi. My name's Kyle. Uh, I understand that your country flies people into space for money.

And Cartman for being stupid.

Dude, some people really do consider this obscene.

Cartman has HIV?

Cartman, stop! You don't know what you're doing!

Because that's what real artists do. People are always gonna find a way to copy our music and swap it for free. If we're real musicians, then we should just play and be stoked that so many people are listening.

Yeah! Where's Grandma? 

Dude, why aren't people coming to help us?

Mr. Garrison, where's Mr. Hat?

Oh, I'm swell, Stan. I popped my hemorrhoid trying to climb the fence into Cartmanland, and it got infected. I really need to go to the bathroom, but if I do, it will pop again and the pain will make me pass out. How are you?

I hate being small and Jewish. I feel like a tall black man.

I'm actually the complete opposite.

I wanna be the tough one.

You guys are wasting your time.

Mr. Hat, may I please be excused from class?

Hay! He's totally underage. She's taking advantage of him.

Yeah! 

Wait. Guys, this, this doesn't seem legal.

I've designed it to be the best place for them to live. A place where they can finally have the care and happiness they deserve. And if you think it's a bad idea, I really don't care!

There he is! 

Dude, I can't believe they fell for it!

The thing is, Ms. Claridge, we did a lot of stupid things when we were kids.

Parents. Mom. Dad.

Is that true?

Look dude, it's just one movie. We wanna have a good time.

Hey, that's it. Oh, my God, that's totally it!  It's so simple!

Dude, you can't miss Halloween! You have your iPad?

Get him, Frenchy!

He looks fine.

Well good for them. They shouldn't! The writers are standing up and saying they aren't going to be intimidated!

Aw God, I'm so borrred. 

He got a full dose of the stars.

They did it to us again! That dirty talent agency stole our client again!

Hey. Aren't you guys the underpants gnomes?

Ugh... 

Ha ha, you look like a pansy.

Yeah, it's cool.

I do. 

Oh, no!

Yeah. Cartman's weight was what gave us speed, so we need to find the next-fattest kid besides Cartman. 

Why?

But who paid for all this? 

Aw, Cartman! You're supposed to bury it!

Ow! Quit it, dude!

Wait! We'll do it.

But I don't care.

Stan?

Yeah he's an idiot but uh I'm sorry, I just... I can't do this anymore, okay? I... I can't do this anymore! 

It's only three days until Christmas, you guys! You know how bad things have been around here. I think it might be because Mr. Hankey hasn't come.

Here's the thing: Whether or not I'm a part of it, crack baby basketball is popular. Somebody's going to do it. So the only way for me to try and help the situation is to be involved in it, so that I can steer things in a direction that is more beneficial to the actual crack babies.  Oh, it's sooo easy for you, isn't it? I mean, what do you have to do except lay there and think about what you did at school today, or what you want to watch on TV tomorrow? Well sorry, Skippy, but the world isn't always black and white! Just because some people are born poorer than others doesn't mean I can't enjoy a few McDonald's French fries in a hot tub of gravy from Kentucky Fried Chicken!

We have reached the Great Pass of Mount Ururalak.

Oh God, it was horrible!

The new kid.

I think I'll add some more... pigs.  Oh, maybe I should put in another field of corn there.  There we go. Nice.  Twenty nine? No, I have thirty friends.  Hey what the hell is-? Oh no! Oh shit! 

He's gone, dude! Butters says he saw him leave.

But it's our game. We bought it together.

But why are you making such strange laws??

And then you said

Cartman! Cartman, wake up! Cartman!

Guys, have you seen Kenny?

That's it?

I actually only just said that sarcastically.

Yeah, but now you can be friends with all of us!

Eh now,  come on, you guys, we can't take this decision lightly. Whoever we pick is going to be the person we do everything with from now on.

One ticket to New York, please.

"David Blaine Workshop. Learn all about David Blaine at the Center for Magic." Dude, we gotta go.

Well, how'd we do it last time??

This is serious, you fucking asshole!

(NOOOO!) 

...Idiot.

Yes. Why?

Because that sounds like we don't have anything, We've been through this already, Stan!

Craig, we have chosen you to join our Peruvian flute band!

Where are we?

What?

Where's your dad?

She had a contract with us first! We own her!

I heard you won't even get in the deep end.

What's that? 

Aww. Well Cartman, you can change things about yourself.

Don't be stupid, Cartman! Butters doesn't have that much blood in him!

You've had that cough a while, Kenny. You okay?

If you guys want there to be a Christmas, you'd better come help me!

I'm ba-ack!

Are you okay, Cartman?

M-Ah, I'd love to.

Dude, no one even listened to me.

I know. But just like you, I feel like I have to try. People can really get hurt, and a joke just isn't worth that.

Aw, hey dude. What are you doing here?

Look, however hard you think it for you, it's a lot harder for him!

F-minus? Can he do that?

Dude, why the hell would you DO that?!

Look, the truth is, we all have a bigger problem now, and you know it. Nobody is going to get anything if we don't work together against those thousands of other shoppers.

Paladin!

Yeah, we're pissed off.

And that's why you got a cold?

Because why?

Why would he do this?!

Sure. Remember that time that that kid in the red shirt decided to go off on his own?

Wow. That's a lot of sea men you've got there, Cartman.

The girls do not have a device that shows them the future Cartman. That's retarded.

What uh, what are you supposed to be?

I'm stoked my cousin is comin' to live with us. It'll be just like having a brother. 

All right! We're going to Canada!

Mr. Garrison, can we talk to you?

Hoh no, dude. If they get sent back to Romania, we'll never get our Cirque dei Ceville going.

It's my seat ring. I have to sit on it because of my hemorrhoid.  Ow.

What's that?

Oh please! All you ever do is call me names and rip on me for being Jewish!

Here! Here's the phone! 

Dude, when he gets out he's gonna be really mad!

So then, she's gonna be seeing other people? Is she, sort of, available?

It would've been faster if Cartman hadn't slashed the tires!

We went through all that just for some gay video of Earth?

Great. 

Yes, yes! Now the Jews shall take control of Christmas once and for all! HAHA! HAAA!!

What?! You were waiting for me in the bathroom!

You guys! You guys! I've looked up the word, "shit"! I think it might have something to do with people dying!

Dad, where do leprechauns come from?

What, Cartman?

Yeah, what are we supposed to do?

But it's down in the snow.

I made you out of clay.

M'kay?

Yeah, but now we think maybe heaven isn't a place you can get to, maybe heaven is just an idea. A frame of mind or, or something gay like that. Maybe heaven... is this moment, right now.

Awww, shit!

The water tank?   Hey I'm not going with you!

Look, we've just gotta get Chef alone. He won't listen to reason with that hooker around.

Mr. Hankey, come here. 

You'll die, retard!

I'm Kyle.

Just what the hell is that thing?!

This isn't a joke, Cartman! You have to believe me, officer. The outcome of the election depends on it.

We need everyone's help here. What you're looking for are big boxes of ballots. Hundreds of them. Please check your basement, your attic, and-

Alright, look. I honestly don't know the secret, dude. Only Cartman does, and that's how it's gonna work for us.

Oh God. What have I done?

Cartman! I need to tell you something!

I know Cartman made it all up, okay?! I also know that nothing is more important for humanity than peace in the Middle East! I'm okay with this, Stan!

Dude! I aced that test! I'm gonna win that dinner with Ms. Ellen!

I heard it, too.

There is no brown noise, fat boy!

You hear that dudes? We'll be rich!

How do you know that?

Come on, limey, don't be a wuss! Are you just gonna be a little French pig your whole life?

You don't understand what my mom will do to me if she finds out I was playing with weapons!

Peter Rabbit.

Yeah, that's awesome.

Hah hah hah!

Yeah, this guy.  Vladimir Stolfsky. He had videos on YouTube of every single rally.

It's not lame, it's sweet! After we build this clubhouse, we're gonna get girls to play Truth or Dare!

Well!  You're gonna be sorry when you see me riding around on Santa's sleigh with Mr. Hankey, fatass!

You think you own the entertainment business, but you don't! Give us back Wing, RIGHT NOW! 

You threw it away, fatso!

Calm down Butters! The men are taking action. But we need to take your picture.

Dude, no wonder terrorists come from places like this! If I grew up here, I'd be pissed off, too!

Yes, let's. 

Hey Ike.

Well, I fell down this ice cavern,  and I saw this block of ice, so I told my friend to throw a rope- 

You know what? I'll bet it was you!

That's not what she said. You're putting extras on again. It's not that funny.

That kid and I had a long talk! I told him he was on a slippery slope to becoming a monster like you!

Yeah! You're dressed up like the South.

Dude! Dude okay! Stop! I'm sorry!  Says that you are currently... hosting an online chat party for all your friends.

He probably thinks if he apologizes to everyone, we'll think he's changed and let him back into our circle.

Yeah, that one.

Yeah.  He's getting... really high on life. 

If we win, we can buy a new go-cart that actually runs.

Is he in there?

What?! I'm not talking to you! 

Good! 

Okay. First one to die, loses.

Cartman farted!

Benedict Arnold. 

When a man and a woman feel ...love... they put their lips together.

So I'm thinking we do the part about Jimmy's relationship with his alcoholic father after you smash Butters onto the table.

Ah-ah-ah-are wooden desks all that available? I usually prefer the plastic ones because these give me splinters.

She said they're from New Jersey.

Yeah. She's really cool. 

Don't even start! Don't even start, Cartman!

If we take him to the hospital, they're gonna find out what happened.

I think I see the television department in the back!

But you didn't do anything to me.

Well, c-cause dude, I'm Jewish, a-and you know...

I have to get online before school.

Yeah. This is really their fault.

Some kids think I'm strange 'cause I like studying for an exam
But I don't let that bother me, because it's who I am. 

Come on guys! He's hidden them somewhere and we have to find them!

Doesn't matter. You're gay now.

Butters!

Hey Stan, Ah- I'm open, I think.

Throw 'em away!  Dudes, here he comes. Guys, stop coughing. 

I dunno. I just have this sudden urge to go back.

That's not scary, fatass!

Hey! It's Tweek.

How can that be? Already?

Dad, can we go home, please?

Oh.

We have to get our friend, Steve-

Shut up, fatass!

So take a shit somewhere else!

Yeah.

(Yaaaaah!) 

Der, Cartman!

That doesn't make any sense.

Mom! Dad!

Huh?

The kindergarten teacher is having sex with my little brother.

Dude, did you finish your math homework? I kind of lost track of time last night.

Oh, my ears feel like they're frozen off, and I think I have a hemorrhoid from sitting on the sled for so long.

Oh my God!

Oh my God!

Ye-yes.

That's horrible. If that's true, I don't wanna see it.

What's a hard p?

...Well, what does that mean?

Look! It might be a coincidence, but I think we'd better ask someone. Come on! 

What's that?

You get in trouble again, Cartman?

You don't even know Heather!

So?

They're cells that come from fetuses, and some research show that they could be used to treat diseases.

Great!

I'm out of mana, I told you.

AAAARRRRGGGGGGHHHHH!!!

Well, because, we don't really... believe in Jesus.

I just don't know what to do. I mean, I hate Cartman with all my heart, but I can't stop feeling ashamed for taking advantage of him. But should I feel ashamed? Oh, whatever lowered the bar is not my fault. So if I kind of go with it, is it really unfair to Cartman?

Holy shit, dude! Cartman's right! 

You will?

Hold on, this fight could last more than twelve hours. What if we run out of food?

Dude, I'm not going to lose to Cartman's stupid turd sandwich. 

Yeah, so, where are they. Let's go get 'em.

Come on, dude. All you gotta do is eat it very fast!

Come on dude, we have to get to practice.

Doctor, this is Muhammad. We want you to clone him, so we can give his copies to gingers, and Barbra Streisand.

Hey Texans! Let me through; we want a treaty!

You don't need that! Get off of it.

Hoh, dude, weak.

Because you kind of made it matter.

Towelie is a tough choice because,  even though I can see how always having a towel around can come in handy, he's just always so high.

Dude, what are you talkin' about? That was awesome!

I don't know. Let's go see. 

AAAAAAA! 

Stop saying "hella," Cartman!  How are we gonna win the contest with a squash?  Whoa, Stan. You don't look so good.

No, ah I didn't lie to you. Ah I was um... uh I felt better and then the guys called and said that they felt better and uh-

Hey!

Well let's look in here. 

So is it a coincidence that Grandma DID talk to me about going to Jewleeard someday?

Wugh, game on. 

Chef, there's a new kid in school, and he's a total weirdo freak.

Fine. That's it. I give up. Have fun being miserable.

Dude, what are you doing?!

After all that?! Shenanigans! Shenanigans! SHENANIGANS! 

We can use Cartman's pig.

What do you mean?

I just think I'd rather... control it instead of blame it on anything.

Dude, we have to do whatever we can to get that feeding tube put back in!

A giant douche.

Guys, we need to talk to you. I really don't think we wanna be a company that ISIS looks up to. We should maybe issue a statement saying that we don't sanction them.

with dreidel I shall play.

Timmy, we already got a turkey.

Oh, no, dude!

Hey. We paid for the sea people too. How come they're not making statues of us? 

Wow uh, you think it takes forty dollars to get people to like me.

Uh what are those? 

What bastard?

Why are you doing this to us?!

"AAAAAAAH!" 

Wow Cartman, the visitors dropped you off just in time to go to school.

Well what the hell do we do?

Yeah, now what are we supposed to do?

Uh. My adopted brother got taken back here to Canada? So, we want to talk to the new Canadian Prime Minister about getting him back?

Who the hell reads that entire thing every time it pops up?

Starvin' Marvin!

Hohohooho! Oowwww!

Come on, Kenny! 

Well then they're not minorities, are they?

You bastards. YOU BASTARDS!

Stan, don't say that.

Triangle of Zinthar?

Okay.

Steve!

Butters, can't you see this is wrong? You've got little boys all over school spending all their lunch money on kisses. Boys shouldn't be paying for kisses. It's wrong.

No. That's the same branch again.

Stan should be Jesus.

Huh?

See? Look at this. Ike has all his friends over and they're just sitting around on their own computers barely talking to each other. Ike is watching PewDiePie play Dragon Age.

Shh. Shut up, Kenny. 

You are NOT KILLING FAMILY GUY!!

What?!

You suck!

I'm just trying to fit in, Daddy. Don't be such a drama queen! 

Dude, it's a good show.

Okay, it says here the operation begins with a one-inch incision in the ab-do-men on the left side just above the hip.

Oh God! I do?

Mr. Garrison, will you make him stop!

He said his wish is not to die. 

'N Sync, Backstreet Boys, New Kids on the Block. All had five members.

Yeah. We're guys, dude. We find something about all our friends to rip on. We made fun of you for being rich just like we make fun of Butters for being wimpy.

I mean, I do, but, well, ever since I became friends with that Kip Drordy kid, a bunch of my other friends have started ignoring me. It would be fine except for my farm is starting to shrink. I know that I should just dump Kip as a friend, but that's such a terrible thing to do and, I'm sorry I'm just so confused I... I really need a friend right now.

They all laugh at me!  And the girls giggle behind my back!  unable to even glance at my disfigured face.

Well at least my mom's not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!

What?

Yeah. And my powerful nunchakus make me into Bunroku , a deadly but compassionate ninja who protects those in trouble.

He's gonna be here any minute, Ike.

Look, Stan, I'm finally whole! My dad is even gonna take me back down to the all-star game to see if I can try out for the team again!

It's not stupid, Stan. For once in my life I feel like I'm part of something.

Huh? Who...? Who is that?

Yes!

Kenny wasn't lying.

Yeah, fatass, it has to be real to be scary!

GRRRRR!!

Alright, we'll take him. How much?

Yeah, that's Cave of the Winds. It's a tourist attraction.

Crap. 

What?

He's faking.

No more money??

You just hate smoking, so you use all your money and power to force others to think like you. And that's called fascism, you tubby asshole!

Yeah, dude. Your mom wanted you to have herpes on your face.

Token actually pays attention in school! Unlike you, fatass!

I'm not sure.

I don't care! You're not making me wait in the van again!

Well, a lot of people like Family Guy too! Who are you to decide it shouldn't be on the air?!

Come on come on! Pull!

Pip  Jimmy  Jason  Towelie  Luigi .

What happened? Aren't you still wallowing in pain?

Dude, it's been to long. Something's wrong.

Don't worry, Ike. Squirts is fun. And I'll be right over there in the next building. 

What's the point?

Okay, Marvin. Time to take your people to their new home!

Sister, you don't know the half of it.

Oh my God.

Yes, I did!

Just, you know, make some money off him. Like Honey Boo boo.

What gold??

When is Mr. Hat coming back?

We did it!

Stan...  Do you really think my hat is stupid?

No! All we have to do is not shop at Wall-Mart anymore! If you want it to go away, all it takes is a little self-control and personal responsibility.

See ya! 

What's your mom doing here, dude?

He must have a huge bone in his ass, then. 

You can't believe it?? He does this shit all the time!

Yeah! You suck, Cartman! 

And if the North wins you're our slave for a month??

Yup. I'm not seeing anything.

This game is fixed! The balls are bigger than Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth!

Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,

What?

No. You know what? Screw this! We aren't ugly!

Relax, fatass.

Look man, w-we know what you learned was pretty tough to hear.

Yeah, that leprechauns were real! And the government just declared they AREN'T technically real, so I was right! It's over! I don't have to suck your balls!

But I'm gonna be Royal Crown Chinpokomon Master!

I'm not looking at that!

I don't know. Last night we found him hiding in the kitchen pantry. He was screaming the name "Billy Mays" over and over again.

What the hell are they doing?

That should do it.

Yeah dude, nothing fun is free.

Better how, dude?

Stop it! Stop!  Oh God! Oh God, help us!

Look! 

I'm so glad we're not murderers. 

Dude, hold on! This is bullcrap! If they wanna live in our time, then they should learn our language!

Six hours.

Hey. They've never been allowed to walk before. They just don't know how.

Wugh!

Cartman is trying to bring Christmas to Iraq.

I don't know about this, guys. I think sleds are dangerous.

Cartman's side is right, for the wrong reasons. But we're wrong, for the right reasons.

No! That's a stereotype.

Ugh! We're gonna end up watching this whole retared Russell Crowe show!

He's fat and he's stupid?

Yeah, it was like four days ago!

Dude, don't you see that it's not? It'd be like, changing Raiders of the Lost Ark!

No way! You wanna go with us so you can betray us at some point and keep us from destroying the Wall-Mart.

...Do you realize how retarded that sounds?

All right, mister! You better have a good explanation for why you didn't show up to play ball!

Goddamnit! There has to be a way! 

What'd he say?

So, what do you want to do now?

Come down here, you stinking aliens!  Uh, uh...

Waitwaitwait, Jimmy told you about this game?

Okay so, what exactly are we doing now?

No, no, w-we we really did write it. Tell them, Butters.

But it isn't right!

Okay, Mr. Marsh. 

Wouldn't it be better to just agree with him and forget the whole thing?

I got it! I got it! According to PayPal, the Russian guys are just hired mercenaries who had ads up on Craig's List and got paid through eBay so that Boston could be attacked by... the British.

Yummy yummy I want your farts in my tummy.

God-damnit, we need to get to the new Prime Minister! NOW!

Why don't you take it to one of those pawn places? Every two blocks you see a guy with a sign that says "Cash For Gold and Jewelry." There must be a lot of people doin' it.

You have to go with him, Ike.

You see, we've learned something today. Swearing can be fun, but doing it all the time causes a lot of problems.

You're doing what?

Then don't belittle my people you fuckin' fatass!

I don't care! You'd better remember where your base is!

Can I have three thousand dollars, Mom and Dad, huh?? Can I??

You... bastard? 

What the hell is everyone wearing on their heads?

How??

We'll give you 10 bucks.

Look, Stan. When Kenny died I learned how important friends are. I'm not gonna lose another friend.

No, dude! We have to name it Steve.

Yeah, screw him. Let's go.  Oh, finally! 

Aw, come on!

Okay, fine. You know what? Let's just get it over with!

Wait! You know what we should do? We should all take a bunch of cough medicine!

Dude, where the hell have you been?!

Nothing.

Why? Aren't you happy here?

No.

What?

You're getting in pretty deep, dude. 

...a-are starting to take offense at your actions. We feel like you're starting to become-hmm... 

Twenty-five cents? Well that's not even worth it.

The government is gonna nuke Imaginationland.

It was my idea and we're gonna tell everyone to write in "Giant Douche!" It's way funnier!

They're evil! I WISH I DIDN'T HAVE ANY PARENTS!

You've never watched the news, fatass!  And what the hell does that have to do with anything?!

I need $17 so we can win Terrance and Phillip dolls.

Uh-uh-uh what do you mean "they've taken it"? Oh, this isn't happening! This isn't happening!!

It's okay, Ike. I'm here.

We have to face it, Cartman.

Ha, Goddamnit!  Haaa. Ohhhh. Ahh, ohh, uhh, agh, 

Do you know anybody with herpes?

Hey. Me and Cartman and Kenny are going down to Happy Burger. Do you wanna come?

Alright, alright! Knock it off! Stop spreading lies.

Hide! 

Oh.

I beat out YOUR fat ass, Cartman! 

Man. Cartman's more screwed up than I thought.

Um, we... sssort of spend all the money on this... one...

Dude, that's not cool. You shouldn't make fun of Christopher Reeve.

Look, we're just trying to show you there's other girls out there.

What's the matter?

Yeah. I guess their rules did have a point. Things have gotten a lot worse in the ten days since they've been gone.

Hey, what are you guys doing? 

Huuh, I wah... just ah... well... that's all. 

Friends? 

Huh?

Jesus Christ!

Hey, look.  Hello?

Ah, I told you we shouldn't have brought him to school dude.

I'm sure we're gonna get word any minute that people have agreed to stop. 

Where is Butters? We were supposed to leave here forty minutes ago.

If they give you something small, will you end the strike?

Oh... Oohh—Ohuhughughhh... 

Well? How was it, Cartman?

Ahhh I've seen this before. Whenever they try to distract a robot in the movies, they tell it some kind of paradox, to get its processors all tripped out.

Ah! Ow! Hey, it hurts!  Owie-ow! Help! Ow, that hurts!

What? No, I'm sick. 

Thanks!

There's nothing here! 

I forgot all about him. 

Aw, come on Dad, don't be such a Jew!

Hello. I'm Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States.

About three minutes, fatass!

Here's our cell phone, dude.  Will you call the police for us? 

Alright guys, do you think he's lying or telling the truth?

In there? But it's very confined. I'll get cramps in my legs.

So, you guys are totally broken up then? It's... done?

No. No, it'll be okay!

Gorak's a gay name.

This is where the elders meet. Nobody is allowed to go in there when they're having a meeting.

...Yeah. That's gonna suck.

Maybe we should go for it.

What?!

Jesus Christ!

No dude, I'm out. Go talk to her yourself. Be poetic. 

E-excuse me, my little brother needs medical attention.

It's not true! 

Next please.  Oh, hey.

I'm the whole solar system! The planets even all revolve the right way. That tub of candy is as good as mine!

My company was on Kickstarter too! Why would I get rid of it?!

Cartman?  He's not gonna open it. Break it down.

Oh my God!

Well, what do you mean?

I guess you should leave police work to the professionals, huh, Cartman?

No.  No, I want to have the Antichrist inside me!

...Nothing.

No, dude. They only changed "terrorist" to "hippie" to make E.T. more P.C.

I wonder why our moms want us to sleep over at Kenny's so bad.

You will?

Yeah. Good job, wizard fat ass! Now we're totally lost.

Well, let's try the dictionary.  queasy, Quebec, queen quelch. No queef.

Oh. Ah-ah. Ah-uh-m-m.

Wait. You guys, I have an awesome idea! We should secretly go around and tell all the students we can, to not check any of the mascots on this election sheet, and instead write in "Giant Douche."

Yyeah, except maybe it's not perfectly great, because to some degree, Ike and Ms. Stevenson are having an-.

What did she say?

Wing?

Ah! Oh God! Oh God!

Wow!

Huh, what the hell is that?

Yeah, you gotta know people.

Except for us.

Hello? This can't be right, I-  Ow!

But Dad, I want-

Dude, this is going awesome.

Oh yeah?!

Dreidel dreidel dreidel,
I made you out of clay,
Dreidel dreidel dreidel--

Dude, look who I found prowling around in my back yard.

Dude, Jambu is the best! 

Our lives have not been enjoyable, Trent! I promise you! 

But, wait. Where's the other team? 

Stan?  Dude, Stan, you all right?

Tweek.

Naw uh!

Not if somebody took pictures without her knowing.

Whoa, dude, what's going on?

Hoh! Hoh hoh hoh hoh! 

Boy it sure is dry out here.

Let go of me.

Cartman, stay away from that door!

Well no, not really. It's the Kindergarten teacher, Miss Stevenson.

No. Way.

What's that?

Don't you oppress me, fat boy.

W-we really didn't see it that way.

No, the nipples are more in the middle, see? 

Yeah, that sucked.

Kenny! Watch out! 

Did you get your period yet, Stan?

Oh my God, dude.

Guess what? You're not my best friend anymore! Cartman's my new best friend!

Aahhh...

Really? Uh, Stan, that's great. 

It has to go back!

ManBearPig? 

Mom, Dad, have you ever met Ike's kindergarten teacher? 

Yeah.

Do you hear that, Stan? It worked! We've shut down the veal industry!  Stan? Stan?? 

We don't wanna be in a group with Tweek.

Nobody else is going to help him, you guys. We've got a chance to do something pretty special here. Are you with us?

Chef, CHEF! You need to get out of here before you get arrested, all right?!

Yeah.

Oh no you don't, Cartman! Every time we get put in a study group, you sit on your ass while the rest of us do all the work!

Aw, dude, check this out. 

We're so sorry. Please forgive my little brother. He's going through puberty.

Oh. Thanks, dude.

Dad! Dad, I need a lawyer!

You know, you used to sit in the living room with your friends and family, and THEY were the ones commenting on whatever was on TV.

I don't have it!

No!  AAAAH!  AAAAH! 

Are you okay?

Really? What about?

What is this? What's going on?

Will somebody just get me to a hospital? I need to get my stomach pumped!

Yyeeaahh.

Sure!
I have a little dreidel; I made it out of clay.
And when it's dry and ready, with dreidel I shall- everybody!

I know! I was lying then!

Yeah. Do you know him?

Look out!! 

Well we got tickets to see Terrance and Phillip Live in Denver tomorrow night. We paid forty bucks apiece for them.

So what now?

Yeah, what it is, Mrs. Marsh?

Uh, a bear?

We can't tell our parents, dude! We lied to everybody! Nobody knows we're responsible for Ms. Claridge's accident!

Yeah. How'd you know?

It's okay. Kenny said he'd get one.

Yeah, this life is short. The afterlife is forever.

Oh, like you know what pain is! Go try living in a Third-World country, you little pussy!

So then maybe you're wrong.

What have you done, Cartman?!

You have that power too?

Dude... What?

NO, why the hell would you keep eating something that made you crap blood?!

Me??!

No way, dude!

It wasn't like Faith Hilling was that great. I mean-

Oh. Sweet, dude. I don't think we have to do this stupid debate now.  Stan?

Mr. Hankey!  Where the hell did you go?

It's been a week since Ike's been gone, and every day my parents seem worse. I have to try to go to Canada and speak with the new Canadian Prime Minister, but I can't do it alone.

Hey, where's the school bus? We're gonna be late for football practice. 

Look, that was a long time ago. Maybe Trent Boyett has forgotten all about it.

Butters was supposed to go with us to Casa Bonita tonight.

That is the dumbest idea you guys have ever come up with! I'd expect this stupidity out of Cartman, but you, Stan?! Butters needs medical attention right now!

Stan, this is it. Time to stop feeling sorry for yourself and come home! Everyone cares about you and everyone wants you back!

I don't know.

Hello?

Neither do I. 

NO!

Cartman!

No-no-no-no. Come on, fatass, we're gonna get 'em all back.

How's it goin', dude?

I hate picture day at school! It's always some gay-ass photographer with some gay-ass backdrop of New England!

Who cares? My parents deserve whatever they get. They're liars and cheats.

Look, just go ahead and play, alright?  Leave me alone.  Can I get a Fresca, please?

Behold! Here's your false prophet!

Quick! A monster of Rivendell!

Who's Honey Boo Boo?

Shut the hell up, Cartman!

Down by the fire?

Boy, that really did the trick, Stan. I thought we were kind of, sort of, not really done for.

Jesus Christ! They can bat themselves out!  Our whole summer, dude. We have to play this boring game all summer long.

Heuh, the commercials! 

Where does that grill go?

...What?

Uh oh, we're losing him. 

It's a, uh, it's a Jersey thing.

Wow.  Well that's awesome!

We're here dude. Just a little further and we can finally end this.

What other companies?

'Cause, we're his friends.

Hmmm, yeah.

Why?

Let's just give it a chance, Ike.

Yeah, yeah, that's cool. Bring the left titty out some more.  Yeah, yeah freeze there. 

We didn't read them!

Well keep looking.

Look, we're sorry, you guys, but the balloon just went up in the air and the dude sang a song and we were suddenly there.

Dude! He got Brent Musberger for a leg!

Towelie.

Yeah. You know, I've learned something today. Family isn't about whose blood you have, it's about who you care about.

I don't know.

That bull sucks! He's not even bucking or anything!

We wanna buy M-80s.

Cartman! 

I left my wife today. Walked out of the apartment without saying a word. I ran away from my responsibilities... just like I always do.  And I, again, am alone. 

Cartman?

Why did you go and have to be abducted, Tweek? Now all our parents are freaking out!

They've got the doll! 

Jesus, dude.

Uh, Timmy, if we back to the other kids with that turkey they're gonna be pissed!

Shut up, fatass!

Kick the baby! 

Doesn't anyone understand the significance of "I'm sorry" anymore?

Hey guys. You wanna throw the football around?

Okay, it's third down. And now, somebody make a play!

You live on the Eastside, Cartman!

You're not gonna believe this.

Oh my God!

Mr. Jefferson said we can invite all the kids in town to go play over at their house.

So how do we stop it?

All you need to know is I'm way awesomer than you think, okay?!

Yeah, huh! You wanna go with us so that later you go, "Haha, I was working for Wall-Mart all along" or something.

A ladder to heaven.  We build it, climb up, and get our winning ticket back from that asshole Kenny.

Well, maybe Mr. Garrison is wrong. You should ask somebody else.

But David Blaine is gonna do more miracles in Denver tomorrow..

Seven and a half.

Time for you to get proven wrong, fat boy.

Everyone came as Chewbacca?!

Stan, you don't get how cool Facebook has become. You can message your friends, play Yahtzee with your friends, even start your own virtual farm and have your friends visit it.

We have to talk to Terrance.

Dude, your family died?

Yeah. Let's just have a slumber party here.

Do you really think that beating up a handicapped kid is being nice? 

Yeah.

Okay, we did it.

This is when you gotta get mean, Tweek.

Shut up, fatass!

We feel bad for other people.

Cartman, do you remember how we all spent the night at Kenny's a couple of days ago?

I got it! I got my Chinpokomon game controller! 

Wow! Three months without parents!

Hey Stan, did you see that rainbow this morning?

Nobody said anything about a post-season.

What?

Yeah, it was cool, thanks.  Um, so... Is there any way you'd

Okay.

I was just explaining how a negative argument doesn't make a po-

Since when you care about being sensitive to people's religion, Cartman?!

Uh, Kenny McHeinenberg.

Dude, why is your store called "The Indian Burial Ground Pet Store?"

Hey, yeah! He and Ned do that stupid TV show.

What?! Does everybody have to do it, or just me?

Mom, Dad, you've always taught me that being direct and honest is a basic Jewish tenet.

Cartman, I really, really have a problem with what you're doing. I object to it morally, and I find it grossly offensive. 

I should have known better! You never cared about my birthday at all!

What? No no no.

Miss Stevens, you have a bug on your back.

You just want Family Guy off the air...

What the hell is that?  Oh my God. 

Okay!

Yeah, I hate you, but I'm not going to help kill you.

Well, Cartman?

Wait till you guys see my costume! It's gonna be sweet!

Suddenly, Stan says he knows about some horse stables. Ih it seemed too good to be true.

Hey. Maybe it's that thing, Scuzzlebutt. 

Don't call my mom a bitch, Cartman!

They saw us on the tour.  Dude, where do you keep going, Cartman?

You were right. 

If it's on the school network we can track the IP address.  This way. In here.  Whoever it is using the computer in the music room.

Yeah, it's just so astounding.

Dude, no way! 

What the--

And that's our report, I guess.

But... they were here. Ah I swear it. Stacks and stacks of ballots from states all over the country!

Oh crap, it's him!

Helping my Dad give people fake tickets. 

Get out of here.

Mr. Hankey.  He comes out of the toilet every year and gives presents to everybody who has a lot of fiber in their diet.

Kill Jesus! Yesss! Arrrgh! 

Wait, wai- I can't let this happen.  Butters.

Well, I- I invested in that IT thing, and there was a bailout, so I received a five million dollar bailout clause check, which, which I can use to help my family, so, I- I guess, goodbye, cousin. 

That's right.

How come you didn't buy any cards, Stan?

We're over here, by the cart. 

Oh. Hey, that's not very nice, Mayor. Just because a person is gay doesn't mean he's a fag.

Eh it's "Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow." I taped it last month.

Meaning what?

Thanks, kid.

Who cares about saying whatever you-?

Dude, we've gotta hurry home! The final episode of Lost is on soon. 

Well I didn't have her do it. She did it on her own.

Tell everyone you made the cow look like that!

Robbed us of our innocence.

Did you guys hear what's going on? There's like four girls at the school now offering to kiss boys for money.

Why are you walkin' so funny Cartman?

I'm going to try and break you away from the computer, Cartman. I need to remove the CPU.

It's stupid.

That's only a vaccination for girls, stupid!

Whoa! 

I promised my mom I'd let him try. 

We need to see the new Prime Minister.

Mass suicide?

Some high schoolers left their marijuana cigarette behind. Uh we have to throw it away before some kids find it or something.

I need one ticket for my little brother.

Fine!

You don't know anything about Jews, fatass!

Me too. 

What's "pubes"?

Weh-well, why didn't you tell anybody?

I don't know, dude. It's like everyone's putting pieces together that aren't there.

God job, Butters.

Good.

Yes.

I'm never speaking to either of you ever again! 

They just released part 3 in theaters and it made 80 million opening weekend.

What do you mean, "there's no tooth fairy?"

Go ahead. We don't wanna be in their stupid commercial.

STAN, WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE! 

I want you guys to all meet my friend. 

Oh no...

Can Kenny block his elderbeast?

You bastards!

I totally know how we can give the gingers and the celebrities what they want, but keep Muhammad safe. Come on! 

Willzy-x, I think we're here.

How do you do that?

Ike!

No, Mom-uh, he, he doesn't want you kissing him. 

Cool! Ziplining.

Come on, we have to finish the quest in Stonehaven. 

W-what's the matter, Kenny?

We're all gonna pitch in on an entry!
Hm. 

(Yes! Please! Let me go!)

See ya.

Don't do it, kid. 

Thanks, Mick! 

All right, fine! We don't need you, Butters!

Why not?

I have no idea!

Sweet. I made mine go off the jump. 

What's it say?

Four tickets to The Lion King on stage!

You bastards!

We do!

In there! Let's go!  Get this jamb on the door! 

Cartman?!

What's a Meredith Baxter-Birney memorial towel?

Where do we go? 

Hey dudes. 

Nobody wants any of your stuff, you fat bitch!

Yeah. I cross-referenced his MySpace page with realtor.com. His parents moved into that green house on Janice Street.

Yeah, we've shown them amusement parks and malls. How can you expect them to go back now??

No, I- I beat you!

Mom?

You sonofabitch, Cartman!  You don't fart when you're locked in a small space with other people! 

You can't just roll into places and take people's lives away!

You sit- 

Dad! You tasered my dad!

Yes.

It's the holiday season, but the good times... are ending.Because what matters most isn't what's good, it's what's trending.
This younger generation, with their eyes and ears glued:
What's trending to them is trenders who trend on YouTube.

Look Butters, why don't you just talk to your family about it? You said your Grandma's visiting this week. Why don't you try talking to her?

You mean there's more to this?

Okay. Okay, come on you guys. 

Bloody butt cough.

Dude, don't forget: Timmy is the only kid who can play Helen Keller. Don't piss him off.

Ready to go Stan?

That's not true, fatass! I have red hair, and I don't have to avoid the sun!

I know.

We'll dub his voice over.

Hello? 

Yeah. 

No no. I mean, go with me.

Yeah, that'd be cool.

You did it, Mr. Hankey. You brought back the spirit of Christmas!

Stan, do you pick giant douche or turd sandwich?

Please stop.

Kenny's ashes were in an urn, and Cartman drank it, thinking it was chocolate milk mix.

We're not bailing on the party, we're just think there's... more important things right now!

Gentlemen, we are off! 

Yeah. Stuff just happens.

Twenty-two people?! All right!

Shut up, Cartman!

Dude, we're gonna see the new Zoopeeker movie!

Did what?

You were scared Cartman! you almost peed in your pants!

I'm your big brother, Ike! 

...Dude...

No! No, I'm not going to Peru! Not Peru! 

Maybe I'll start my own company.

I'm sorry.

Aaaa...  AH! Huh?! 

Hey dude, ah are you the guys messing with Cartman's stuffed animals?

Whoa! They gave you an anal probe Cartman?

No, Cartman, we're going in there and splicing Fluffy and my elephant together.

Cartman, let me out of this stupid net!!

Stan! Stan!

Oh God, no! 

Well, I guess let's just be thankful we're not Butters. They won't even let him come back to school.

I found it! I found it!

You guys, who cares if the girls make some stupid list? Girls make dumb lists all the time.

I have no idea.

You know what, Cartman? I believe you.

Yeah. Yeah, that counts.

All right, then we go with the plan. Just like "To Catch A Predator".  The first guy is here. This is probably HotForBoys219. 

Hey, you just got here, Chef!

Mr. Garrison, seriously, I have to go. Can I please be excused from class?

Oh, my God! 

Chef, does poo go to heaven?

I don't have a choice, dude. I'm gonna swallow my pride, face Cartman, and say "Congratulations. You were right" And I'm gonna give him the ten dollars. And hopefully, he won't make a big deal out of it.

Come on, let's go!

Yeah.

What?! Get the hell out of here!

Jesus, dude. W-w-what happened? It's like, something's lowered the bar to the point that nobody feels any shame anymore.

I know it's hard to believe, but you have to trust me.

There's no choice anymore, guys. Don't worry about me. I've been preparing for this for a while now. 

Where is it?

What is it, Mr. Hankey?

Oh cool. We get to watch a movie?

No, dude, it's the police. 

What do we do?!

What the hell do you think you're doing spreading this crap to kids?!

What the heck is that? 

To where?

We knew you could do it!

No ending? Well, we can't animate until we have our voices recorded, so we'd better just record what we have and figure out the ending later. 

And neither were you, Pip!

Sshh, don't scare him.

You dumbass, Cartman!

Don't worry. I know what to do.

What's strike three?!

People don't hate the Jews!

Yeah! Then she told us to throw a chair at Ned!

We're missing out on some quality video game time right now.

Can you act like you're giving him a lot?

You son of a bitch! I won't let you win!

Goddammit tell her! I wanna go home!

Yeah?

Uh where should I sit? There's no place to sit down here.

Hey man. You okay?

Worse than this?

I didn't see a handkerchief. Did you see a handkerchief, Kenny?

Come on, dude! I can do it! I'm sure!

Wait. I thought you called your planet Marklar.

Hey dudes.  What are those?

Dude, you have to tell everyone. Right now.

It is?

I'm sailing ay...

Yeah!

Here.

Yes. I'm saying one-fourth of Americans are retards.

...Oh, yeah. Sorry.

Son of a bitch! 

Where the hell are they coming from?! 

But if I stop now, I'll just be going with the group again. So, to be an individual, I have to bomb Pearl Harbor. See ya. 

Hey!  How about Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo?

I got it! I got the ball. 

Yes! I can't help but take some credit for this. I helped convince him to go!

You have to! Here, have some more mayonnaise. 

No. What's chatroulette?

Oho, we will. Trust us. We won't miss this. 

Set, set.  Damn it Cartman!

Well, that didn't work. What else can we try?

Dude, shop class sucks. Maybe we should have taken home ec.

Dude. You have sex with children.

What are you doing?

Sometimes I think I can see time slowing down,  and my own existence fading.

We can eat it at Cartman's house, and see more naughty pictures of his mom.

How about we revamp the name? Super School News sounds dry.

You can do it, McNuggets! 

Well, we've all talked it through and we've come up with a theory.

All right dude, what the hell has gotten into you?! I don't trust for one second that your sudden concern for the Muslim people is real!

Ah... a a a meth lab?

Stan?

Look, let's just get our money from EA Sports and get out of this whole thing once and for all!

Jawas?

Butters wrote a second book!

And so they put us in these harnesses and helmets. I th-I think that's when we started realizing, "Oh wow, this is actually pretty dangerous."

Good point.

You guys! You guys! I have awesome news!

Why?

Well you should. The poor guy shouldn't be screamed for something that just isn't that big a deal at all. 

We don't wanna go!

Jesus Christ! 

We told him to grow up. So he got rid of his stuffed animals.

We came on our own 'cause our friend's purity ring is killing him.

Well I've been thinking: maybe there's something you've come into contact with that hinders HIV from growing. Do you mind if we just look around?

I'm set! Let's do this!

Look, Stan, we're really getting concerned about this cult that you're getting into.

Don't worry, dude. That little truck just runs on D batteries. It's gonna run out of juice soon. 

-And I'll labor. 

I guess not.

I guess I didn't realize it was just about the points. 

Don't worry, guys. I'm getting a nurection as we speak.

But dude, there must be something in your past you're not dealing with.

Wait a minute, the rights to Star Wars, the movies? What the hell is going on here?!

Dude! Every time we play Americans vs. Bosnians, you cheat!

Why not?

You mean, throw the game? You know how our parents are about this sport.

Yes!

But that's stupid.  How can that replace Faith Hilling? It doesn't even make any sense.

Well, I was talking to Cartman, too!

It's dying. The living room is... dying.

A hundred thousand for a picture of Britney peeing on a ladybug. Imagine what a photo of her crapping on a squirrel is worth!

Mom!

Fine! We'll do it with out you!

Damnit! What the hell is wrong with you, Tweek?!

Wow, cool!

Well, what's the Evil Power?

Shh, Blanket, we're gonna take you away for a little while, okay? 

Oh God!

We... didn't realize what we were doing, eh...

Alright then, hu-how do I catch it?

Because now he's acting like gingers are awesome. And all his friends are gingers. When he wakes up tomorrow and realizes he isn't really ginger, it'll be hysterical!

Mom! Dad!

Uh, hi, we want you to end this strike. 

Kaii yo! 

What are you doing? 

You can't do this! We were gonna build an orphanage! So the crack babies have somewhere to go!

Cartman doesn't always win! He just gets pissed off and goes home so we can't debate anymore!

THIS is the reason why our living rooms are dying!

Oh God! Oh God! I have to tell the truth!  Mooooomm! 

Oh Jesus, I should have known!

Surprise, fatass!

Stan, the PS4 doesn't have the seamless transition between games, movies, and TV offered by XBox One.

I'll kill you, Triceratops! You made fun of my crippled mother!

I told you Cartman, I'm not one of them! I don't wanna live in West Jersey any more than you do!

He's smarter than you, fat boy! I don't even know how you made it into fourth grade! I thought--

Dude, I just got an IM from Stan that they evacuated the school.

What's Cuba?

The question is, "Where is the heart?"

You aren't just gonna hand Snowball over?

Okay. But you've gotta promise to not complain.

Yeah. It's almost as big as Cartman's ass.

Nuh-uh!

Okay, will you let Muhammad come to South Park if we dress him like a pirate?

I don't think Mr. Jefferson pays enough attention to his son to notice. Come on! 

Yummy yummy thank you Cartman. 

Dude, I know you're pissed at me right now. You've gotta understand that I did it because I know in my heart that the XBox is better, for all of us.

Well just hurry, Butters. You can probably make it back in time before the first commercial break.

Die! 

You guys, we've just been screwed over and lied to!

That's one twenty-fourth of a second of our movie already shot! 

But I can't wait to be an adult to be happy. That's forever from now.

You seem tired, Stan.

Will you shut up about 9/11!

Dude. Have you been drinking?

Uh, why not?

See where I am? It's this way. 

Chop off his wee wee?! Are you sure?!

Hi, uh- our friend has been brainwashed by some fruity little club.

Yeah, we wrote that!

Hey, why did you guys forfeit?

Stan, it's over. You have to admit what you did so our parents could help us! 

Chef! I can't believe you're back!

Uh huh.

Dude! Timmy's chair is packed with all that stuff! We've gotta help him!

Dude, that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

I can't do that, I'd just feel too bad.

Goddamnit, Cartman! What are they gonna say on Cop Drama?

I know, fatass. I was there.

Well, why don't we make 3 o'clock?

Oh, whatever. 

Gays, I guess.

Yeah, you're not a lesbian, fatass.

Really?

Yeah, you're a great Meheecan, Butters, just not a great leader of Meheeco. 

Uh, Chef?

Fun for children?! Fun for children?! Look at me, Dad! I don't even know what's real anymore! Weaaaah! 

Dude, shut your fuckin' mouth!

What?

Dude! How are we gonna move twenty three calves to your house?

Yes. I did! 

How are you rich?! Your mom pays for everything!

Dude.

So we were just wondering if we could sue somebody.

Cartman farted in there! We had to breath it in for 20 hours!

Shhh. Willzy-x, don't say anything. We're gonna bust you out of here.

Yeah, this is stupid! Books aren't magical. 

No more boring baseball until next year!

Come on, you guys! We better get to work! 

Ah, I thought we were speaking for the children.

Yeah, and if you couldn't prove there was a leprechaun, you have to give me ten dollars! Now just pay up and stop being stupid!

What?

No more timeouts, fatass!

Yeah, we made the whole thing up. It was all just a really, really funny joke! 

Then just tell me what Cartman is up to!

Here you go!  Here you go! 

Yeah.

You motherfucker! 

What the hell happened?!

Will you stop with the underpants gnomes, Tweek?! We have to work here!  

Yeah.

Indy deserved more than that!

Please, you have to listen to me! The prophecy actually did come true!

Let go of the tape, Butters!

But I never take off my hat.

Okay, where are the E-mouths?

Come on, this is serious!

Do you think they'll believe it?

No! For not being a metrosexual.

What?

What do you have to think about?

Dude. Being mature is boring!

Oh, stop it, Cartman! 

But what about Mr. Garrison? He can't go back.

There's no sand in my vagina!!!

We only have one option. I've gotta take you to the surface.

I have been sick!

Oh, Jesus, this bus is going fast!  Oh, I did it again!!

Uh, I must have the wrong number. We were trying to reach City Airlines.

Don't worry, Mr. Hankey. We'll go tell everyone. Come on, guys. 

All right, all right. 

We made it! It hasn't gone to commercials yet. 

God damn it!

That's two against one, 'cause Stan doesn't care. So it's giant douche.

What?!

...our hearts.  Kenny? 

Oh for sure, dude! It's the most God-forsaken place on the planet! Things are finally gonna be normal around here.

He's a big guy, with a beard.

I didn't see he wouldn't be there, either. Look, all we have to do is get them there, right? Once Terrance and Phillip get together again, it'll be like old times.

Aw, dude. 

...What? 

What's tree-fitty?

I know. I'm almost at the end and there's nothing. 

I got voted the ugliest boy in the whole class?

What I understand is that you totally screwed me over!! So why should I have to listen to you?!

Mr-&#160;! Goddammit. Here, come on. We need to clean that up. 

What's an anal probe?

Jimmy.

When Cartman first opened the door, and saw the Thompsons, he felt bad for playing a joke on them. Now that everything's turned out alright, he's able to laugh.

Aaaah! Runrunruuun! 

No way.

I don't care!

Jews are tough!

What? 

Whoa, I don't think anyone's been in here for centuries

How do know that?

No way!  You do it, Kenny!

Maybe they should project the movies on Cartman's ass. 

Naw, I think I'm through with fads for a while.

Mom. Mom. I found out all about this great new magician named David Blaine.

Yes we do! Just not the Christian heaven!

It's my name, and I found him.

I don't know how you do it, dude. How do you get up in front of that many people?

Hogh, my stomach hurts.

Do you?! Do you, Stan?! Because all my life I was raised to believe in Jehovah! To believe that we should all behave a certain way and good things will come to us. I make mistakes, but every week I try to better myself. I'm always saying, "You know, I learned something today..." and what does this so-called God give me in return? A hemorrhoid. He doesn't make sense!  What is your logic?!  Ow. 

You bastard!

He's here! Vince McMahon is here!
