A woman pooping out her boobs is not good imagery!
Well uh, he'll have to do. Cartman has to get some practice with a real bull.
I know, but he posted a message of me with a schlong on my head.
Well, Tweek's okay, but he's certainly no Kenny! 
Yeah. See, we got you to fight just 'cause we wanted to see who was the toughest. We made up all that stuff we said to get you guys mad at each other. 
So now I should stop liking Chinpokoman because you all don't?
No! What we really should do is go to our parents right now and take responsibility for smoking ourselves. Even if it means getting grounded.
The base where you're from and where our Okama GameSphere is! 
What?! But she looks just like everybody else. Up yours, Tina Yothers! 
Wow! I had already forgotten how great third grade was.
Hey Cartman, I need to talk to you.
Mr. Garrison, it's Kyle! Our egg is okay! We'll be there in a couple of minutes!
All right, now everybody take a tablet and a pencil.  and when all the ideas start coming, just write 'em down. We might not remember everything otherwise.
So, just to be completely clear, now it isn't funny, right?
I don't know what we're going to do? It's been like four hours and people still won't talk to us.
Cartman, how stupid are you?! Didn't you read the Bible? We have to leave you up there until you die, and then you come back to life in three days.
Are you sure this is where they said to be?
Get ready guys. Whoever is in here is the kid that's hacking our e-mails and phone calls! You guys ready?!
Yeah... He must be really sick.  Hang on Willzy-x. There's still hope. Stan and Craig might still luck with the space program down in Mexico.
Our lives have not been enjoyable, Trent! I promise you! 
Yeah. I don't remember him saying anything about this.
Dude, you'd better watch it. The principal's right over there. 
Well, I fell down this ice cavern,  and I saw this block of ice, so I told my friend to throw a rope- 
Ike, you can't possibly want this. We have to tell Mom.
Yeah, but he's some kind of genius, so he's getting advanced placement in kindergarten.
When the bar gets lowered, Token, we all pay the price. What if Honey Boo Boo was a little black girl? Being fattened up by her mom and talking about grits and hominy?
Don't panic. I'll tell you what to say.  You can tell them...
Here, give me some money, Cartman!  Lend me money, fat boy!
Cartman, let me out of this stupid net!!
It just keeps getting worse. I see stuff from Amazon almost every day. My poor dad has no idea.
God-damnit! Now, what the hell are we gonna do?!
We totally think you should have more money.
Eh I, I don't know what else to paint.
What has this world come to? Where people can just... take your Okama GameSphere.
Be sure to take me to the same hospital!
Copy, Fox trot, let's fly in the goods Tango.
And in the end, I know that somewhere out there... there's the good part of Chef... that's still alive in us all. 
When Kickstarter went down, many saw their startup projects die, but here at Washington Redskins, we saw opportunity. People still need a way to raise money for their stupid startup projects, and with the Redskins you can now go fund yourself.  And the idea is simple. You, the people, go out and raise all your own money, and give the Washington Redskins 5%.
Because that's what real artists do. People are always gonna find a way to copy our music and swap it for free. If we're real musicians, then we should just play and be stoked that so many people are listening.
Well yeah, but not if your decision is for Turd Sandwich! What the hell is wrong with you?!
Get the bull in the balls with a snowball.
You have to! Here, have some more mayonnaise. 
No matter what we think, it's not just a passing trend. We need to realize that the new generation of entertainment is here.  And I, think that's great.
But you know, I've learned something today. I've learned that people who want power, a lot of power, always... end up dead.
Dad, I think Ike is starving to death. 
There it is!  That must be of the antelope family.
Yeah... You know, it seems like something's still not right. 
Dude, what the hell has gotten into Cartman??
Dude, the sooner you eat your peas, the sooner you can try to win some of your friends back. Eh ya you need to Bill Clinton this.
This has gone far enough!  How can we make people see the difference between being sensitive to obesity and letting fat people walk all over us?!
Dad, if you agree to something but you didn't mean to agree to it, what do you do?!
The odds on a single number in roulette are thirty-five to one.  That means, with a ten thousand dollar bet, you win three hundred and fifty thousand.
Twenty-two point three years. That's how long it takes for something tragic to become funny.
Where's all the cool costumes and jumping off ropes and stuff?!
It's what we do in Jew Scouts. Usually we just sit around and make stuff. But tonight, because there's a meteor shower, we're gonna do some big thing out in the woods. It's gonna suck ass, I'm sure.
I am sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Keller, but I'm afraid your daughter Helen still cannot see, hear, or speak.
Can you guys meet me over at Cartman's house tonight at around midnight?
But everyone tries that. There has to be something you're exposed to that others aren't. Could we see where you sleep?
It's funny that something that should be completely private is put up on a Web site for everyone to see??
Nuh uh! It's "Whoever denied it, supplied it!"
Yeah, but if they're wrong, no big deal. If we're wrong, we burn in hell.
He purposely infected me with his HIV virus!
Dude, thanks for helping us out by joining our team.
But it's okay, Stan, because I finally figured it out. You see, if someone like Cartman can get a million dollars and his own theme park, then there is no God. There's no God, dude.
You'd better!  Dad, can't we talk to this new Canadian Prime Minister? Iif he knew the situation, he might e-
Excuse me, sir? I think I know who did this. We saw this guy at the last crime scene, and, and you know how serial killers sometimes return to the scene of the crime? Well, I followed this guy to his house, and when he left again, I collected some fingerprints and did a blood-sample analysis.  I'm pretty sure he's your man.
All right dude, what the hell has gotten into you?! I don't trust for one second that your sudden concern for the Muslim people is real!
Oh, yeah. Yeh-yeah. It's a-it's not even noticeable. 
That is the dumbest idea you guys have ever come up with! I'd expect this stupidity out of Cartman, but you, Stan?! Butters needs medical attention right now!
Ike! Ike! Wake up buddy! Wake up! Ike, you've gotta wake up, please!  Eh there you go. That's good.  Oh Ike. I thought I lost you, little brother.
Just make sweet love down by the fire.
Yummy yummy I want your farts in my tummy.
You guys wanna see how long I can hold my breath under water?
Come on, Cartman! You haven't liked anybody else!
How... How did this happen?  Mom, Dad? Why are you shopping here?
You are gonna tell everyone that you lied and that we aren't a couple!
I know! But that doesn't matter any more! These kids don't wanna play the game, they just wanna watch people on YouTube play it. And you know why? Commentary.
You're not supposed to rock, you're supposed to keep the beat!
Cartman!! Wake up you fat piece of crap!! 
Hang in there, Ike. We're gonna get you help.
We told him to grow up. So he got rid of his stuffed animals.
Nah, my mom packed me a kosher lunch.
Oh no.  You're not stinking up the entire boat! You're taking a crap off the side into the water!
No it's not cool!  My mom won't let me keep him in the house.  She says he's too big, and that his poop is bigger than our couch.
Do any of you guys have milk money I can borrow?
We're not gonna hurt her, we just need some of her blood.
Yeah, you are! You always get in trouble
There's no way we can go all the way back. We'll never make it now!
Ladies and gentlemen, my best friend, Mr. Hankey, is getting sick because South Park has become overcrowded with people who eat health food.
Stan! Stan, what the hell is going on?!
Yeah, try to have everyone make peace so it doesn't seem like a big deal.
How stupid do you think we are?! Now you die on that cross and get resurrurected before I kick your ass!
I wish that was good enough, but if you censor out Mohammad, then soon you'll have to censor out more.
I don't know. Do you know where he is, Marvin? 
We're, we're in trouble. We're in sooo much trouble.
Which one of us took it?! It was so long ago, I c- I can't remember.
This is the worst day of my life.
Just take me home! I don't wanna be here anymore! Take me home!
Do you really think your civilization is better than ours?! You people play games by killing animals, and oppress women!
IT WASN'T MY IDEA, IT WAS YOURS! YOU KILLED KENNY, YOU BASTARD!
We need some help identifying an ancient English stone.
Not now, Cartman! I have really serious problems!
You don't get it, Stan! I can play here all I want. I even get free Frescas. I don't need you anymore! 
Aw man, here we go again! Use the Jew as a scapegoat.
Go ahead. We don't wanna be in their stupid commercial.
That doesn't make me feel better! I wouldn't even be able to keep it down.
Whoa, I don't think anyone's been in here for centuries
Oh, Jesus, this bus is going fast!  Oh, I did it again!!
I'm not going in any meat locker so you can trap me!
You gotta come to Kenny's house with us.
Yeah, look what you're doing to this poor kid.
You dirty son of a bitch, you never told us that we had to win-
Hey dude, people are kind of pissed off at you.
Is that why there's crap on my doorstep every morning?
Come on dude, we have to get to practice.
He did not say that! You just want him dead so you can have his stupid PSP!
Stan, you can't keep doing this to yourself. You have to go live.
Nono wait. I I know how you can reverse it, Cartman.
Nobody wants any of your stuff, you fat bitch!
Hey! Maybe you can come with me. Then it won't suck so hard.
What?  You mean the missile defense program?!  Butters, where's Cartman supposed to hand over the ballots?!
Couple of days?  But Terrance is going to have his human clone by tomorrow.
Dude, I don't wanna watch this thing have a baby.
Sure!
I have a little dreidel; I made it out of clay.
And when it's dry and ready, with dreidel I shall- everybody!
And then like, out of nowhere, somebody came up with the idea of ziplining.
I have an idea.  I don't like it, but I think it's the only choice we have.
Dude, shop class sucks. Maybe we should have taken home ec.
Yeah. We're guys, dude. We find something about all our friends to rip on. We made fun of you for being rich just like we make fun of Butters for being wimpy.
We're not basing research for our report on this crap!
I wonder why our moms want us to sleep over at Kenny's so bad.
Go ahead! People will just download your songs for free on the Internet anyways!
Boy, that kid's having a hard time adjusting to public school.
It's still stupid and now I paid 49 cents for it!
I've been thinking, Wendy. This whole outcome is pretty strange.
Oh cool. We get to watch a movie?
It seems like I might get splinters, though.
It's okay, Ike, you're going to be... okay.
Hey. Ms. Crabtree had that little TV, for the trainng video? Maybe we can watch TV on it.
We're sorry, Butters.  Our mind is made up.
Dude, where is she gonna get fetus clothes?
Who cares? My parents deserve whatever they get. They're liars and cheats.
Fun for children?! Fun for children?! Look at me, Dad! I don't even know what's real anymore! Weaaaah! 
I can't believe they would put a fake Mr. Hankey in a mall! If Mr. Hankey ever found out, he'd be so pissed!
We'd better be. We've been in line for almost an hour!
Boy, that really did the trick, Stan. I thought we were kind of, sort of, not really done for.
What if they don't show the Terrance & Phillip trailer at all? What if we went through all of this for nothing?
Goddammit, Cartman! You only got that because you knew my mom would buy it for me!
Yeah... but doesn't it seem like we got out of the White House pretty easily? I mean, it seems like it would be pretty hard to escape from the White House with everyone chasing you, and we just kind of... ran out. 
You guys, we've just been screwed over and lied to!
All right, all right!  Dude, what is the matter with you?
Yeah. He's almost as bad as that guy on Full House.
Dude, what the hell is going on?! Why did they replace Phillip?
Uh Butters didn't show. You wanna go to Casa Bonita with us?
-bring me back my little brother, God damnit!
Yeah, I noticed that too. Let's go get some ice-cold lemonade.
It's the holiday season, but the good times... are ending.Because what matters most isn't what's good, it's what's trending.
This younger generation, with their eyes and ears glued:
What's trending to them is trenders who trend on YouTube.
Maybe we should get out first. See if we can find a way out and then come back for him.
It's too bad Cartman can't be here to enjoy this.
Okay, okay. Stan, you're right. Maybe I let being a martyr go to my head. Just please, let me stay on this path, and, I'll try to be cool about it. Okay? I'm sorry.
Haven't you noticed everyone getting sick? It all started when they said "shit" on television.
Well! I hope it lived up to all the hype! You must feel so much better now!
Why did you go and have to be abducted, Tweek? Now all our parents are freaking out!
Well why not? You want us to get AIDS?
No, Mom-uh, he, he doesn't want you kissing him. 
All right. Butters, go get next to her.
Dude, we're gonna go sneak into Cartman's and change him back into a non-ginger!
It wouldn't be funny if that Web site posted something about you!
NO! I put your headset on, and came here to-
Bebe, I thought we were going to watch Terrance & Phillip today.
Nuh, it's more important than that. Our school is putting on a big show for Earth Day, and we promised people we could get you to perform.
Twenty-five cents? Well that's not even worth it.
Dude, we can't do a presentation on underpants gnomes. Mr. Garrison will fail us because you're making it up.
Dude, we'll have Chef's $2 million in no time!
He's smarter than you, fat boy! I don't even know how you made it into fourth grade! I thought--
It was him. It had to have been him!
No, no, you... you wrote down Turd Sandwich.
It's okay. You don't have to feel alone anymore. 
I said go away!  My father said you aren't real.
Tweek. Now there's an interesting choice. Tweek has a lot of qualities that I look for in a friend.
Dude, look who I found prowling around in my back yard.
No, it's Cartman. Something's really wrong with him. 
It was really about the most man thing I think we've ever been a part of.
Yeah, that leprechauns were real! And the government just declared they AREN'T technically real, so I was right! It's over! I don't have to suck your balls!
"Get ready", "answer the door", Jesus Christ, make up your friggin' mind! 
Dude, he must be loaded! What does he do?
It's too much power. For anybody. Stan's right. It has to be destroyed.
I can't believe it. I can't believe we have to keep on playing.
Well, I had to see it to believe it!
Hey. Hey, look over there, Stan. That Raisins girl is really cute, huh?  Why don't you say hi to her?  Excuse me? 
How do we make three hundred thousand dollars doing that?
Yeah. Come in for a minute, would you?
Oh no! It's that  super-sad Sarah McLachlan commercial! Look away!
Well, I turned off all my Apple stuff. They can't locate you if you don't have your stuff on, right? 
How did your date with Ms. Ellen go?
Rebecca, in public school,  we select our... own mate.  In public school, men and women get together. Make each other happy.
Dude, that video is making people act strange.
Cartman, I thought all you wanted was a Haibo doll!
What do you mean? We're learning all kinds of cool stuff.
We need to see the new Prime Minister.
Okay, fine, I will!  H-wait a minute! I don't even want one copy of Time Cop! 
Butters, do you really think it's fair to lie like this?! Let me tell you, if you don't have the-
No, Ike! You can't come to school with me. 
Ih it's me, Kyle Broflovski. I had a negroplasty. Can I play in the All-State team now?
Maybe we need to make students think they have to watch our news show or they'll die.
Cartman, you are poor and you are stupid!
STAN, WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE! 
Look Butters, why don't you just talk to your family about it? You said your Grandma's visiting this week. Why don't you try talking to her?
I don't know about this, guys. I think sleds are dangerous.
This is our shot at making it into the WWE. To be real wrestlers. 
Kill it, Stanley. Kill it.  Come on Stan, kill it.
Why do you always have to hit stuff with a stick?!
Hey! That's it! That dance! I can ask Rebecca to go to the dance!
Eh it's "Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow." I taped it last month.
Dude! Did you really lose all that weight eating nothing but sub sandwiches?
Aw, dude, come on. I gotta do my science homework.
What was it about? Ih-in case our teacher asks us.
Miss Stevens, you have a bug on your back.
I've been thinking, how did shamelessness get to this?  Did it start with fat people on scooters? Or did the bar get lowered way before that? And then I started thinking, maybe it was us.  I don't know, but maybe somehow, we lowered the bar, a long time ago.  And now we're all sittin' here in the stink of it all.  There's no going back, Stan. 
Dude, I know you're pissed at me right now. You've gotta understand that I did it because I know in my heart that the XBox is better, for all of us.
Ungh, I can't find the word "queef" anywhere! 
We can get everyone back into the Christmas spirit by making our very own animated Christmas special, and showing it to everybody in town! 
I'm sure we're gonna get word any minute that people have agreed to stop. 
Yeah, but what about all the people getting laid off from the grocery stores?  And what about all the- 
Mph. Okay, Mr. Hankey. We're out. How are you doin'?
Ike, I'm sorry, but I couldn't get us out of school Friday. I can't take you to Yo Gabba Gabba Live.
It says, "Read Teetle the Timid Ta-- Taa-- The Taxi--" What's this word?
But where are we gonna get the money to buy costumes and and the instruments? 
This is ridiculous! Just because they say it on TV it's alright.
Hoh! Uh, Rebecca. There's this dance, see, at the school, and um,
Uh, alright then.  Oh, would you look at that? I've got a corn on my ankle.  Now where did that one come from? That's the fourth one I've had- 
Well everyone has already seen it; nothing we can do about it now.
Cartman, don't be such a baby! We're supposed to be rugged outdoorsmen!
Cartman, you're supposed to be studying! What the hell is all this?!
Dude, that's not cool. You shouldn't make fun of Christopher Reeve.
What is going on?! Why do you want Britney Spears to die?!
Yeah. We're very good friends. We're very good friends, Stan!
No, no, w-we we really did write it. Tell them, Butters.
You're having nightmares about the ending to World War Z again?
Yeah, dude. Your mom wanted you to have herpes on your face.
Well, what's the point? Jimmy always wins with his stand-up comedy.
Because anybody who thinks 9/11 was a conspiracy is a retard!
Who cares if your dog is gay? Maybe it's not that bad.
Take a look, fatass! I beat you! You aren't going on Dateline; what have you got to say now?! 
Okay, Ike. You're my little brother, so I have to show you how to celebrate Hanukkah.  This is called a dreidel. You spin it and see where it lands. And you sing this song:
I have a little dreidel; I made it out of clay.
And when it's dry and ready, with dreidel I shall play. Oh,
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay.
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with dreidel I shall play.
I got 'em! Four tickets, 68th row, to Terrance and Phillip! I waited in line since 3 this morning!
I'm the whole solar system! The planets even all revolve the right way. That tub of candy is as good as mine!
Hey! Hey!  Who the hell told you to put this thing back up?!
Wait! Wait a minute.  What about a logic loop?
No you didn't, asshole! What you did was totally stupid and racist! And you only did it to screw me over!
Anyways, I need you guys to help me so that my parents don't realize Ike is gone.  Knock it off, asshole!
I don't know what the hell to do. The whole world's gone crazy.
The sea people from Cartman's side are suicide-bombing the buildings on Tweek's side.
Wait!  I may not have Santa, but I do have Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo.
Check it out: Now we're going into the secret underground base.
Yeah! Timmy's probably back in third grade right now living it up!
Yeah, but you're our new friend and that makes you cul.. p-piable!
Oh. Hey, that's not very nice, Mayor. Just because a person is gay doesn't mean he's a fag.
Stan, I have to go home!! I need my cream!! I need my creeheam!!
All right I've had enough! Leprechauns are imaginary!
Oh no! No, Ike! You are not watching him comment on things!
So we were just wondering if we could sue somebody.
We can't. We're saving our money for the balls in Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth game.
Yeah. This is like the third day in a row. I wonder what's wrong
Yeah, it was the craziest thing. I hid myself on a plane to Antarctica. Oh, it was so dry down there.
Kenny, we have got to make Stan understand the importance of voting, because he'll definitely vote for our guy.
Oh dude! Dude, this is the part I was talking about. Check out the bassline on this! 
Hey, yeah! He and Ned do that stupid TV show.
Heeey Ike! Look what I got.  The new Call Of Duty! Do you wanna go downstairs and play?
Ike, you'll always be my little brother, okay?
That's nice, kid. I knew Mr. Hankey before he was even famous.
Hi. We were wondering why fatass  I mean, Cartman, hasn't been showing up for school.
Guys! You guys!  Listen: Cartman has tens of thousands of voter ballots hidden somewhere. He's changed the outcome of the election!
That's okay, we'd rather just go by ourselves.
Damnit! What the hell is wrong with you, Tweek?!
I can't believe I let you scare me into taking your side. You used fear to make me stop believing in free speech.
He's gotta show up. He's just got to.
I don't know about this guys. I think playing hide and seek in the airport might be dangerous.
I bet you don't win.
They don't let big fat asses
perform on TV.
So then don't have a slumber party if you're gonna be an asshole all night!
I appreciate what you're trying to do, Mick, but I ain't a charity case yet.
What's this about you going on live television on Saturday?!
Cartman, I really, really have a problem with what you're doing. I object to it morally, and I find it grossly offensive. 
All these people are going to be gaming on XBox. You really wanna just game with Craig the rest of your life?
You said you could get us money, Cartman!
Dude, this book says there could be infinite alternate realities to every reality.
Alright, Cartman! What's so important you had to pull us away from lighting cow crap on fire?!
That wasn't the Mayan apocalypse, you racist idiot!
Wait. Wait. I think I can explain this whole thing. Marklar, these marklars want to change your marklar. They don't want Marklar or any of these marklars to live here because it's bad for their marklar. They use Marklar to try and force marklars to believe they're marklar. If you let them stay here, they will build marklars and marklars. They will take all your marklars and replace them with Marklar. These marklar have no good marklar to live on Marklar, so they must come here to Marklar. Please, let these marklars stay where they can grow and prosper without any marklars, marklars, eh or marklars.
Well, maybe we can sneak in over there. Come on.  Sshh. 
Ike, jump down, now! For the love of God, Ike, jump!
I guess you should leave police work to the professionals, huh, Cartman?
Well, all my life I felt I was black! I've listened to hip-hop, I watch UPN and I love playing basketball! My body doesn't reflect who I am inside.
Because, if we go to the tobacco company, I know exactly what'll happen. They'll take us in, and then Rob Reiner will show up with all the townspeople, holding torches or something, and there'll be a big showdown until we talk about what we learned, and change everyone's minds - this is all following a formula!
Yeah, let's watch Yo Gabba Gabba, like old times.
Mr. Hat, may I please be excused from class?
Stan! Go get the other guys and tell them to meet me at the bus stop in ten minutes!
Alright, fine!  You're the spokesman, Cartman! But you'd better not screw it up!
Can you imagine it, Stan. A mind, emptied by that... thing.
You're not gonna die, Kenny. Don't be stupid.
We'll help you look for him after the game Stan.
Yeah, this church kicks a-- Eh... I-it kicks!
She said it's fine, but that I still have to go to baseball practice tonight..
I don't care! You're not making me wait in the van again!
This is wrong. Uh this just doesn't make any sense. Why would Homeland Security send us into Peru?
Hyeh. Yeah. Mung isn't even a word! We made it up! 
No Ike! They're playing the trailer to the new Terrance & Phillip movie during the show, and we have to watch it! 
I know! It's so much worse than Catcher in the retarded Rye!
Cool! Maybe we can do that to Cartman's cat.
Dude, you said you wouldn't say everything looked like shit!
Dude, don't you see that it's not? It'd be like, changing Raiders of the Lost Ark!
Okay, okay, wewe'll switch off. Starvin' Marvin can stay here for a week, then at Stan's, then with me.
Look, we're sorry, you guys, but the balloon just went up in the air and the dude sang a song and we were suddenly there.
Oh, you're doing it, or else we're gonna bust your whole scheme wide open, and tell your mom you haven't actually been at your drug rehab this whole time!
Well, we've got something to tell you about Veronica, Chef!
You're doing the right thing, Stan. Don't you feel like you're a part of something now?
You're having dinenr with his family? What kind of family has a kid like that?
Dude, did your dad know that the show was being broadcast live?
It's true. We think that word might be plaguing our friend, Kenny.
We can't. Kenny just checked. There's a wall of people like seven miles thick behind us.
Wait a minute. Ha-how the hell did these two guys end up here?
I'm going to New York to kill the Queer Eye For the Straight Guy people!
Well, I attend South Park Elementary, ah-and... w-one of the teachers is having sssex with a student.
This is ridiculous! Are we really going to go out there and play North Park like this?!
Oh, jeez, we're gonna have to buy tons of these things.
I just had a couple more questions about-
It doesn't matter if I am or not. People voted and I stand behind the president.
No way! There's no real connection between us. It was all a big lie.
I've had enough of the Bible. What has it gotten me?
Do you know what those kids are going to do to you?! A little middle-class white boy telling them what to do? They are going to fucking murder you! 
What is happening to our living rooms? There is a crisis in America, and-
Yeah. Maybe if we can get higher ratings by the end of the week, they'll let us stay on the air!
Jesus, I can't do anything.  I'm just a fourth grader going against the entire government.  Uh, hello? Jesus?
Cartman, there are people in the world who really have Tourette's Syndrome. This isn't funny!
Hay! He's totally underage. She's taking advantage of him.
Dude, we have to get rid of our weapons so at least we can try to deny everything.
Aren't those the queermos on the Disney Channel?
Well, I just figured you'd vote for my guy! Who's fuckin' friend are you?!  Puffy!
So we're not TP'ing a house with kids inside it!
What the hell is everyone wearing on their heads?
Butters has been missing for a week! You might have inadvertently gotten him killed!
Agh! Look, dude, we're on level 24, about to cross into the Caverns of Madness!
We got the money, Mr. Hankey. We're gonna make our animated Christmas card.
Well come on! We gotta tell you what happened. I'm sure glad it's over with. 
What if this is all just somebody's dream?
Dude, some people really do consider this obscene.
Yeah, so, where are they. Let's go get 'em.
Nobody gives a crap about your Trapper Keeper, Cartman! 
Dude! How are we gonna move twenty three calves to your house?
Cartman is trying to bring Christmas to Iraq.
Dude, you need to snap out of this! So Wendy left you for Token. What are you gonna do? Just be miserable your whole life?
But our big game with Lakewood is Saturday!
I believe that you're a broke, ignorant idiot!
Aawwww! Hey Dad. Is it true that you and Kenny's dad used to be best friends when you were young?
I know Cartman made it all up, okay?! I also know that nothing is more important for humanity than peace in the Middle East! I'm okay with this, Stan!
I guess so. She's, like, his first real girlfriend ever.
Look, the truth is, we all have a bigger problem now, and you know it. Nobody is going to get anything if we don't work together against those thousands of other shoppers.
Heidi Turner said you asked her to borrow superglue last week.
Whoa! What's wrong with your head?! Why are you shaking like that?
I don't care if I signed an agreement!
I think if we try Kenny's neighborhood, we might find a- 
Do you really think anything's gonna be any different now?!  Do you really think that this will have the tiniest, smallest effect on the world?  It's still the same old world out there. Look.  What the hell?
Let's do this together, dude.  Our only shot at playing any next-gen console is by teaming up. If you wanna game on a PS4, then I do too.
Hey yeah! That'd be sweet! We could totally ruin their lives! 
See? I told you, dude. Those are dialysis machines.  Old people have to hook themselves into it with a tube, and it sucks all their body fluids out.
We're thinking that a lot of people in town starting too... 
Huuh, I wah... just ah... well... that's all. 
It was seriously about the greatest night of our lives.
It's about time, Kenny! Did you bring the pumpkin?
D-hude, this is gonna be so killer. They're all gonna get herpes!
If it needs to be seen by everybody, then why don't you put it out on the Internet for free?!  Well?!
Yeah, maybe starting a detective club isn't such a bright idea.
Boy, it looks like you're not welcome anywhere elephant.  See ya. 
That system is totally screwed up and does nothing but wreak havoc!
Oh God, here we go again! 9/11 was not a conspiracy, fatass!
Man, I guess sometimes we let our technology and stuff grow too fast.
We didn't think that by pretending you didn't exist, you would really change, but you really have.
We don't have a choice, dude. That guy killed our characters 14 times.
Well, because you got good coordination, sharp reflexes, and you're fucking fat.
Platform 4F. Uhhh, it must be on the other side of the station.
Don't, don't act for me, Stan! Really?! Because every minute I'm watching this video become less about awareness and more about you!
Look at yourself! You've got to lay off the cheese! 
Goddamnit, Cartman! What are they gonna say on Cop Drama?
No! We can't divide like this!  Stan?  You're on our side, right?
I can hide it!  Nobody ever has to know!  I can't ever let anybody know!
Those XBox Ones are as good as ours!
Shh, Blanket, we're gonna take you away for a little while, okay? 
In our deal with EA Sports we are giving them the right to use images of the crack babies and their names. But we aren't paying the crack babies.
You're not copying my homework, you lazy turd.
Oh no, dental floss, what will I do?
Man, it's really starting to snow.  I hope they don't close the roads.
Dude, maybe we don't have to rip a tooth out of Kenny's mouth.
Don't worry. We'll do this quick, okay? Just hang on, Mr. Hankey, just hang on!
Alright, fine! Let's just get this stupid report over with!
But now let me tweet this for you all to comment upon.
The more connected we get, the more alone we become.If you want change like I do, and feel the same gloom,Then please follow THIS trend, #savethelivingroom
No, dude, you're supposed to put their hand in warm water and it makes them pee.
We can't let those sixth graders get their hands on this videotape.
I don't think it's gonna be that hard to keep it from breaking. This whole assignment is stupid.
Goddammit Cartman, stop throwin' those stupid poppy-things at me! 
You guys go tell Butters to start making the cutoouts. I'm gonna go tell Mr. Hankey the good news!
This itches! Give me some of that calamine lotion, Cartman.
Don't worry, guys. I'm getting a nurection as we speak.
The new neighbors that moved in next to Stan's house. Me and Ike saw the mom get a parking ticket, and she called the parking cop "muff cabbage".
You guys! You guys! I have awesome news!
I know, hunh? Put your mouth against the glass like this.  Waaaaah! 
We're so sorry. Please forgive my little brother. He's going through puberty.
...french fries...pizza...pizza...pizza-french fries... I wonder where our parents are.
Guantanamo Bay?! We can't go to Guantanamo Bay!
Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastards!
Ex-cuse me?! If my little brother has been getting some athlete's hormones, then who has been getting Ike's medication?!
I have to join Jewleeard and make Grandma proud!  Tell my parents I'll call them. 
Don't worry, Mr. Hankey. We'll go tell everyone. Come on, guys. 
So then we sit there for like, thirty minutes, because we had to wait for this couple who was running late. 
City Wok brought him down to a size 4.
Hey Stan. Dude, I want you to have this. It's the twenty bucks I owed you plus thirty dollars interest.
I don't want to kill myself. They rigged this thing to fill with water! 
You said "fuck you" to my face, Stan.
How do we find somebody who can wrestle that well?
I got voted the ugliest boy in the whole class?
Do you think we can still make it in time?
You know what? I'll bet it was you!
He's right, dude. We have to define our style if we're ever going to make a platinum album. I mean, ah I'm a fusion guy, but Kenny's background is more Latin Jazz.
...Kenny, will you tell Cartman to shut up?
...Dude, you're supposed to vote for Giant Douche.
Alright, this is gonna sting for a second. 
This is where the elders meet. Nobody is allowed to go in there when they're having a meeting.
Nothing. But the guys said if I don't confess my sins and eat crackers, I'm gonna go to hell.
God-damnit, we need to get to the new Prime Minister! NOW!
Okay so, what exactly are we doing now?
Sorry, Mom. I just had to deal with Ike. He-he's been cranky. 
Oh, stop it, Cartman! You didn't learn anything! Not a God-damned thing!
Scott Tenorman is an eighth grader who sold Cartman his pubes for ten dollars, and now Cartman's all pissed off.
Well!  You're gonna be sorry when you see me riding around on Santa's sleigh with Mr. Hankey, fatass!
I was trying to make an appointment to see the principal about getting excused on Friday. So I can take my brother to go see Yo Gabba Gabba Live.
There's not gonna be any robot guards, retard! Just get Kenny! 
I'm gonna shove that thing up your ass!
I am not full of meecro- what? Look, the word "shit" first showed up in English in the 1340s, the same time as something called, "The Black Death".
You guys are so good you'll probably go all the way to win the national title!
I can do it. It just got... look, it just doesn't matter, because it's not true.
Can't we just play with that big parachute again or something?
Don't hurt anybody, sir. We could try and fix this.
Cartman, you hike me the ball, then somebody run, and I'll throw it at something. Ready?!
You don't understand what my mom will do to me if she finds out I was playing with weapons!
I think he said he wants to practice on a real bull.
I think I see the television department in the back!
Listen, doucher! Our parents are gonna kill us, and you, if they found out that we bought these!
Please, you guys. This is for Earth Day.  You care about Mother Earth, don't you?
Dude, we don't have time for your stupid jokes! We're gonna die!
Yeah! All you have to do is fart some more, Cartman, and the visitors are sure to come!
You're garbage! You know that?! You're cabbage!  You've got cabbage in your muff!  You've got cabbage in your fuckin' muff! 
Yeah. Well, she likes Ike a whole lot.
Let's go. Oh my God, that smells good. 
Look guys, all we need to do is split up and apply some good diversion tactics. We'll use the Texans' emotions against them.
Please, you have to listen to me! The prophecy actually did come true!
No way, dude, then I'd have to suck Cartman's balls
Noo! Wait! You can't listen to him! He's a lying deceitful monster who only wants Family Guy off the air!
Butters, you don't really believe that, do you?
Oh wait. Wait, I'm supposed to play here.  Hey, Mick, w-would you mind if I stepped out for a sec?
Calm down Butters! The men are taking action. But we need to take your picture.
Oh, my ears feel like they're frozen off, and I think I have a hemorrhoid from sitting on the sled for so long.
You can't talk to Stan, Wendy. He throws up when you do.
What are we supposed to do with him?
Well ah I guess in wrestling we're supposed to make our own outfit, and then wear it over this.
Okay, I'm gonna go grab mine. I have an idea.
All the time: "Look out for your little brother, Kyle!", "Take care of your little brother, Kyle", and he wasn't even really my little brother.
All right. Mr. Garrison, have you ever had a friend who got a new girlfriend, and then stopped being your friend, and it pissed you off?
Okay, it's third down. And now, somebody make a play!
There can't be that many pet stores in South Park, dude. 
Yeah, but, why can't XBox automatically let you pre-order Metal Gear Solid V?
Yeah, we've shown them amusement parks and malls. How can you expect them to go back now??
That's what they're talking about on the news!
Oh, bu- but isn't the cold air making the ball really hard? Ih-it's gonna hurt my hands.
Yeah. Come on, Dad, this place sucks. I wanna go.
Shut up, fatass! Everyone knows I can spell better than you.
I think out band better buy a whole bunch of music CDs to listen to for inspiration.
You mean, throw the game? You know how our parents are about this sport.
Do you?! Do you, Stan?! Because all my life I was raised to believe in Jehovah! To believe that we should all behave a certain way and good things will come to us. I make mistakes, but every week I try to better myself. I'm always saying, "You know, I learned something today..." and what does this so-called God give me in return? A hemorrhoid. He doesn't make sense!  What is your logic?!  Ow. 
Your grandma left it to you! You didn't earn it!
But we can put our money together with the money you made whoring yourself to all the women. How much did you make?
Uh alright, sorry kid. Gue- guess we have the wrong house.
Dude, this whole building is going to collapse!
You know, you used to sit in the living room with your friends and family, and THEY were the ones commenting on whatever was on TV.
So what should we do now? It's Saturday and we have to have as much fun as possible.
We're totally screwed!  They took the two best judges away!
You son of a bitch.  You didn't solve your homeless problem, you just sent all your homeless to South Park! 
Disposing of the doll wouldn't be easy. He would have had to have brought a shovel to decapitate it.
Hey! Maybe we should ask the girls what they learned in sex ed.
Nope! We're gonna have all the pizza you can eat, twenty different cakes, and Lorde is going to play live!
Damnit! How come every time we get a sweet idea, the government has to screw it up?!
I need $17 so we can win Terrance and Phillip dolls.
I'm going to try and break you away from the computer, Cartman. I need to remove the CPU.
You know God-damn well what! Now get outta here!
You're not getting away with this, you fat turd! 
Whoa. Check it out, dude.  It's got little drawings on it.
Come on. Let's go see how Cartman is doing with his uh, urection.
Oh. Uh, can't right now, but maybe another time. See ya! 
It's Mr. Hankey! I think he's in some kind of trouble. 
Yeah, but you know? I think we all learned an important lesson about laughing at other people's misfortunes.
Butters! We said you can't watch it! We have a quest!
What the hell is wrong? "Can't find the server" Kickstarter. 
Uh, oh, this, this is, the new retarded kid.
But instead, we should all be treated the same, with the same laws and the same punishments for the same crimes . For in that way Cartman can be freed from prison, and we  will have a chance to win the sledding race on Thursday.
Give me the drum, and you play the flute.
(I can't take it! I want out right now!)
No. They're not a part of your betrayal?
Because some people think vaccinations can give you autism or Asperger's!
How do you know? You weren't even there.
I didn't suck his balls, all right?! And I'm not going to!
So if you're identical, does that mean you all think alike?
Mom, Dad, can I go with the guys to see the Raging Pussies?
Well Token was a definite winner for talent show. But then we decided to take everyone to a baseball game, to see how we got along there.
God dammit, Cartman! You can't keep making up new powers!
Stop wasting the tacos on your hand, Cartman!
Yeah, fatass, this is their famous Mechanic sketch.
Well good for them. They shouldn't! The writers are standing up and saying they aren't going to be intimidated!
I know that I'll have to testify, that I'll have to... relive what I saw that day.  But I can't let Spielberg and Lucas get away with it. Not this time. Even if I have to do it alone.
Yeah, dude. I told you, we had bread sandwiches for breakfast.
Will you please take your rally conversation somewhere else?
Yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy.
Sir, we would love to sign your wife.
Check it out, dude. The camera shoots one frame at a time. So, all we gotta do, is put the right mouth on, according to what syllable they're pronouncing at that frame.
Well, we've all talked it through and we've come up with a theory.
God damn it this is serious, you guys! Cartman has stolen the election!
Well, so then WWE will recruit us and not them.
When we said "documentary," I thought we meant 60 Minutes, not Honey Boo Boo!
God damn it!  Wendy, Stan wants to know why you break up. 
Hi. I've uh...  I've been saving up for a new Xbox game but... but I think you could use the money a lot more than I could. Listen I, I want you to take this.  It's twenty dollars. 
But what about Mr. Garrison? He can't go back.
Yes. It's because the Pharaoh won't give the Hebrews what we want! God is angry.
Aw, come on, dude! All you've done for the last four days is mope around! You might as well hang out with those Goth kids who dress in black and talk about pain all the time!
What?! You were waiting for me in the bathroom!
I'm sorry.  I I'm sorry, I can't do this.  I'm not doing this. 
Dude, this is great! You know all the Stations of the Cross, right, Stan?
Oh my God... their pitcher was able to hit him right on the bat.
Thank you, rabbi.  In 1973, the United States officially issued an apology to the African American community for slavery. In 1956, Germany officially apologized for World War II AND the Holocaust. And now, I believe, in 2004, the Jewish community needs to apologize for the death of Jesus.
This is amazing! But wait right here. I've gotta go tell my friends about this! 
I'll give you five bucks to eat your puke.
HAHAHAA! Now I shall rule the --  Aww. Uuugh. God it burns! AAAH! My soul is on fire! Whoa! Oh, I don't like this!  I didn't know it would feel so... dark and evil!
I can't lose another friend. First Kenny and now Stan? All I'm gonna have left are you two douches. 
You don't wanna go back to stinky Romania, do you? It sucks there.
I'm sorry, Kip, but I really can't be your friend anymore. It was a great ride, but I must say goodbye. This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do, but ending a friendship... is never easy. 
Remember the time when we got an elephant to make love to a pig?
Dude, don't forget: Timmy is the only kid who can play Helen Keller. Don't piss him off.
Yes. My name is Kyle Broflovski. Can you tell me if I purchased an Oculus Rift headset there?
Yep! I love basketball. I wanna play for the Denver Nuggets one day.
Why are they all out driving at the same time?
You mean that you aliens actually enjoy sitting around and watching us fight and kill each other? Dude, that's messed up.
Because, he kinda like looks like Steve Austin, the $6 million man
Yeah. But there was so much of it. I was up until two in the morning.
Hey, it looks like one of those Etheropians.
Dude, we've been working this case since two-thirty!
This would have never happened if you would have let Kenny be a princess in the first place!
So then why do you just ignore it using something as stupid as Chipotaway?
Dammit, Cartman, you are such a fat fuck!
I guess there's nothing we can do. Chef likes her more than us.
Mr. Jefferson just seems like he wants to be a kid, not have one.
Look. You guys built a machine together that can bend time. If you'll just agree with him, you can build another one and usher in a whole new era of science!
I know, but—why do they have to take it out on us? Why do we have to wait around for them to come back?
Cartman, you fucking hunk of fat, rat-fucking hunk of pig-fucking ass fat.
Kick ass, dude! Cartman's mom throws the best birthday parties ever.
Dude, it's bad enough we have to sit here without you taking a crap every ten minutes!
Oh geez. Maybe we let this thing get out of hand. This issue is so complicated, but... m-maybe we sh-should just let Kenny go in peace.
Yeah. People are willing to pay big money to see Kenny do this stuff.
We believe that films are pieces of art that must be preserved from the perverse hands of their agent filmmakers..
What are we gonna do, Stan? It's, it's not like we can change the way an entire country thinks. I don't like it, but it's just the way they are.
But I did! Ah, I brought democracy to Cuba!
Dad! Somebody's at the front door!  Well am I grounded or not?!  Ugh. Fine! I'll get it! 
Ike, there's been a mistake. You don't understand.
Uch, I didn't think there would actually be a leprechaun! And I still don't! Why would a leprechaun be warning us of a terrorist attack?! There's another explanation for all this.
Wha-? Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You Bastards!
Sister, you don't know the half of it.
The atmosphere is oxygen-based, should support our breathing.
I think we can do it, Stan. I've been close to a million a few times by myself.
The only reason we scored high was because we took the answers out of Garrison's desk! And you know it!
It says right there "a parent has to be with you to sign up," and you'll never get your mom to agree to something so horrible, so ha! 
You aren't gonna cut off his wee wee. Not today, you sick-ass weirdo!
What the hell are you talking about, Cartman?!
Yeah. Clearly Annie Nelson is the hottest girl at our school. Look at those eyes!
No, I think it's something you have to try a few times. Until you get it... right. 
Mister... Jackson, y-you aren't alive. You're in purgatory.
Well, cou, couldn't just you know, get rid of the part of Tooth Decay?
I'm never gonna win that two tons of candy looking like everybody else!
Ooogh. Dude, the thing is, we're not the ones that made them crack babies. That's their moms' goddamned fault!
I'm gonna take Butters. He invited me to his birthday party last month, so I owe him one.
You know what's goin' on. It's Smackdown tonight. Which means we might have to fight each other.
Yeah Stan, we have to go find out if Cartman's pig is pregnant or not.  See ya. 
What do you mean, "there's no tooth fairy?"
That bull sucks! He's not even bucking or anything!
Yeah. Just when he was being accepted he has to leave and start over.
That's right, we've still got Lorde. You talked to your dad, right Stan?
Ech, even if it could work, how would we go about shutting it down?
Stan, it's over. You have to admit what you did so our parents could help us! 
And if I had just one wish, just one wish in the whole world,
If I had one wish it'd be for Cuba to change.
Because I think that all the Cubans are in pain
All the joy in the world, from sea to shining sea
Doesn't mean a thing if Cubans aren't free
I just can't be very happy, that's certain
Not as long as your Cubans are hurtin' 
Oh, won't you search your soul and find a way to change your mind?
That is my one and only wish.
No, no, no.  We want to make little pot-bellied elephants that people can keep in their houses as pets.
Why don't they leave those movies alone? We liked them the way they were!
Because that sounds like we don't have anything, We've been through this already, Stan!
Come on, Ike! I promise I'll be nice to you from now on!
Hey, so... do you wanna be Facebook friends?
But that's all that matter now! It's just all ... and the new celebrity?
You sold us out?! For an iPod Nano?!
Yeah, fatass, we're gonna dig up-  Dig up Kyle's dead grandma??
No, No thanks, that stuff tastes like pee.
I didn't come here to talk about The Passion, Cartman!
Wait!  I brought him! I brought him to show you! 
That's not being nice! That's just putting on a nice sweater!
Wait a minute, Dad was the UPS man?
Yeah, what do you guys wanna do now?
It was my idea and we're gonna tell everyone to write in "Giant Douche!" It's way funnier!
Come on, Marvin! We've gotta get your people to Marklar before the missionaries do!
How are you going to try to get invited to Casa Bonita this time?
Dude! What if Cartman really does succeed? And we really do have to be his slaves??
Yes! I can't help but take some credit for this. I helped convince him to go!
We won't let it happen again, Mr. Mackey, m'kay? 
I still say this is a bad idea.
We got six days to make it to Los Angeles. If we keep our stops to a minimum, we should be able to get the episode pulled just in time.
Dude, why aren't people coming to help us?
Stan! You've got to help us become good Christians. Please.
I got some sound advice... from an old friend. 
You don't think that-? But he isn't real.
Naw, I think I'm through with fads for a while.
That was totally gross. She smelled like vitamins and pee.
It's not enough! Ever since Kenny switched sides, there are more kids that wanna go with PS4 on Black Friday.
The kindergarten teacher is having sex with my little brother.
What the hell are we going to do??
City kids get to go to museums for field trips. We get cow farms.
But that's not fair! You lied to me!
Dude, I can't believe we are dealing with this Muhammad thing again.
Dude, he's not gonna swing! So just throw balls. That way he'll have to walk to first base. 
Oh my God! What the hell are we gonna do for six hours?
What happened? Aren't you still wallowing in pain?
Because Butters isn't a total dick to me!
I dream about it every night. Every time I close my eyes I see us just running away, running while they ray-rape him over and over again.  And because we did nothing... they got away.
This is your fault, Cartman! Now we're gonna fail!
Oh my God, they killed Kenny! YOU BASTARDS!
Now, don't go saying that. There's always hope. Miracles happen most every day.
To people like you, and me.
But don't expect a miracle.
Unless you help make it to be.
You hope, and I'll hurry.
You pray, and I'll plan
We'll do what's necessary, 'cause
Even a miracle needs a hand!
Yeah, and then Chef pulled up in his car. 
What? Y-you want me to hang out with you?
Throw the ball, you stupid frog!  God-damn, maybe if you didn't eat all those croissants,  you'd be able to-- Ow! 
I mean, what if I'm just part of my parents' reality?
Yeah, what if they had modified the Roman Coliseum every year? It would just be another big douchey stadium now.
It's my little brother. He's really changing and I feel like-
Jimmy, we're gonna have everyone write in a mascot that's really funny, and you have to tell us which one would be funnier.
We just have to show you this new species because you're the Department of Interior guy now. Soon, they'll all be eaten by bears.
Hybrid cars don't cause smugness, people do.  Look, hybrid cars are important. They may even save our planet one day. What you all need to do is just learn to drive hybrids and not be smug about it.
We all have Attention Deficit Disorder. So we all started taking Ritalin.
You won the bet. You were totally accurate about being able to crap out your mouth, and I've just been frustrated because I didn't think of it first. I want you to enjoy that money because... you really impressed me with your insight and... I'm... proud to have you as a friend.
Why do people have to keep reminding us of what we don't have?!
No it isn't. Come on, I have an idea.
You were sticking these in your ass, Cartman?!
Why do they even allow those things in stored?
Why would they play such a cruel joke on us?
Damn it! Come on! I'll try to get more money from my mom. 
How can they let an eight-year-old decide Kenny's fate?
Please, sir. I traveled a long way to get here. He's the only person who can help me.
I'm sorry, Stan. I'm sorry. This whole war has just got us all so screwed up. I just want us to be playing Call of Duty on the right machine.
Ah, damn it! My little brother's trying to follow me to school again.
Wait! Stop! Could I have your attention, please?
It is stupid and immature! So you got people to crap out of their mouths! What do you want, a feakin' medal?!
Nobody's blood is going to jump up in the air!
It wasn't like Faith Hilling was that great. I mean-
And you! You should be ashamed of yourself! Don't you understand that us males are defined by our firemen?!
Well, guys, I guess we're going to Canada.
Sir, we are really worried about our friend Clyde. Everywhere he goes people are telling him he had blood on his wiener.
He said Madonna is an old anorexic whore who wore out her welcome years ago, and that now she suddenly speaks with a British accent and she thinks she can play guitar and she should go fuck herself. 
Maybe the problem is we don't have very good stories to report on.
Let's take a test sample: There's four of us, you're a retard, that's one-fourth.
Cartman, we should probably talk about our chances.
Tell everyone you made the cow look like that!
Yeahyeah, Mom. I-I can't go to the lake. No, S-stan's having emotional problems and I need to help see him through it. He's got-  wha-what is it?
Aw Goddamnit, now you've made me miss my ride! My whole day is screwed up because of you! 
Aah I think you'd rather hear this in private!
Yeah. If we're Jewish, are we gonna go to hell?
They say they can do whatever they want because imaginary things aren't real!
"David Blaine Workshop. Learn all about David Blaine at the Center for Magic." Dude, we gotta go.
Knock it off! I don't have your stupid picture!
Why?! So that we can lose our business and everything can go back to old times?!
Oh, no thanks. We don't do that stuff.
Alright, alright! If it means that much to you, take the stupid triangle!
So how'd your date with Ms. Ellen go?
NO. Dude, maybe you should see a doctor.
Nothing. Um , my period is really uuuh...  Uuuh, my period is going swimmingly.
Sir, you recently passed a new law allowing parents who have given their children up for adoption to change their minds. My little brother was-
We just wanna warn you: Eric Cartman, the fourth grader, is goin' tuh try and trick you somehow into getting your wiener bitten off by a pony who lives at Denkins' ranch.
No- Dude, Gorak is cool because it's original. And besides, you found him.
It's a long trip, dude. You're gonna need help. We can try and get the episode pulled together.
Did you smoke some of your mom's crack?
Go on and go home, you fat chicken!
Our little man is growing up, Stan. He's growing up.
Do you really think that beating up a handicapped kid is being nice? 
Yeah, that's Cave of the Winds. It's a tourist attraction.
'K.  She says she's been wantin' to break up for a while, and it's nothing against you.
Uh, nice costume, dude. Who are you supposed to be? Luke Perry?
Yeah, but you know, I've learned something today. It would have been wrong to exploit Butters' weight loss. Because then lots of fat people would have believed it. And then gone and eaten a ton of Chinese food instead of dieting properly. They'd still be fat and, we'd be responsible for their shattered dreams.
From now on, MOOP isn't about money. MOOP is about music! We're not striking anymore! Who's with us?! 
I don't think they're going to be able to get all of you in frame Cartman.
...But you can't melt ice with a cool song, 'tardheart.
Oh, dude, I don't know how I can take it.
Guess what? You're not my best friend anymore! Cartman's my new best friend!
Red Robin can be rented out, for wedding parties. If we all chip in we can pay for the deposit to have the wedding party there.
Well, this is what I believe in now, Stan. And if you can't respect that,... then I guess we're not best friends anymore. 
Yeah! I could just say I got my period! It's not like they'll check. I can just say I got my period, 'cause I really will get it someday! It's not really lying, it's just jumping the gun a little.
Well then,  you've got to call the jail right now and tell them that you forgive Cartman for being a dumbass!
Why do you put them into people's asses? Are you planning some kind of alien takeover?
It's only three days until Christmas, you guys! You know how bad things have been around here. I think it might be because Mr. Hankey hasn't come.
Yeah, we made the whole thing up. It was all just a really, really funny joke! 
Look, my fat bastard friend is trying to trick the network into getting Family Guy off the air.
We need to get our friend to a hospital right away!
He knew he had to take us all home, too, right?
You unbelievable son of a bitch. You never cared about the Muslim religion. Or the safety of people in America. You just want Family Guy off the air!
The Jewish population isn't dying out, fatass! It's growing!
Ih it sure is quiet up here in the mountains and it's dry, too. Do you have a humidi-humidifier?
Here.  We made ten million theoretical dollars. It's all for you. 
Wow Cartman, the visitors dropped you off just in time to go to school.
No you're not!  I read the brochure, Cartman! If you're under eighteen, you have to have a parent with you to sign up for the Special Olympics.
Well, we thought you went exploring and like, hunting and stuff!
Just tell us where Lemmiwinks is being held prisoner so we can kill this stupid rat!
Kenny didn't have the head lice, all right?!  It was me.
Dude, my mom and dad keep fighting all the time. And both of them say it's because my dad doesn't have a nurection. So I want to get him one.  Damn it! What the hell is wrong with everybody? 
Yeah!  I was just hanging out in my room, and then I perioded all over the place.
I hate being small and Jewish. I feel like a tall black man.
This is not a woman! It is a succubus!
You're gonna give up on Faith Hilling just like that, Butters? How could you?
Cartman, you only come to soccer practice on Fridays, and that's only because we have Kentucky Fried Chicken afterwards!
I think it went really good. Those people really got into it.
Well, maybe we'll get ours soon, too. I'm gonna go and see if I'm bleeding out my ass.
Come on, everybody. I think Kenny wants to be left alone. 
You guys, I feel kinda bad for that kid.
It looks even better than their first movie, huh?
...star-starting to become alienated from some of your friends.
Goddamnit, you know I don't carry gold in a little bag around my neck, Cartman! Whattaya want from me?!
All right, I really don't want to have to do this, but... I'm not happy with the direction this company is taking.
I'll give you ten bucks to eat it.
Mr. Garrison, since haiku sucks so much ass, could we go to the planetarium again?
Dude! I had the same dream! We jumped on a dragon's back and, and Butters got left behind!
We-ull, some fish would be great if it isn't too much trouble.
Dude, you killed your own dad, and you're worried about that?!
Dr. Biber said he can give me a negroplasty so I can finally look the way I've always wanted. He even took my picture and then did computer imaging to show what I would look like after the surgery. 
Come out here and talk to me face to face! Open this door!
Dude, if 4 million people play the brown noise at the same time-
Just because two people are the same race doesn't mean they belong together, you fat racist piece of fucking garbage!
Yeah, but Cyborg Bill is totally gay now. Please Mom? Everybody else has Chinpokomon.
We have to watch them! We can't miss it!
Bu- but I got these tickets to see Lion King on stage.
No, Muslims can't show an image of Mohammad.
Mr. Hankey.  He comes out of the toilet every year and gives presents to everybody who has a lot of fiber in their diet.
Damnit!  Tell me what to do, Willzy-x! How do we get you home??
Dad? Dad! What the hell are you doing?!
How the hell do you have more friends than me?
I just didn't think it would come so soon.
Dude, that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
So then where did the eight hundred dollars we made from selling an Internet ad to Payless Shoe Source go?
You just feel bad for yourself that you're in detention!
That was the dumbest ride I've ever seen!
I didn't see he wouldn't be there, either. Look, all we have to do is get them there, right? Once Terrance and Phillip get together again, it'll be like old times.
That's how God is! And if Pharaoh doesn't give us what we want, next he's gonna kill all Egyptian first born boys!
You know what you assholes like! You like to fuck! And shit! And fuck! And fuck! And fuck! And fuck!
What the hell is that lady talking about?
Yeah? Well... maybe you can forget what happened, but I... can't.
I'm confused. Did Ally Sheedy take that personality test?
Really? Thanks, dude! I'm gonna go get a video camera! 
I knew it! Don't let that fat turd walk all over you, Jimmy! Stand up for yourself!
An online chat party for all his friends... Dude, I should get over there!
You've never watched the news, fatass!  And what the hell does that have to do with anything?!
But I feel like a basketball player. That's all I wanna do. 
Wendy, nothing's gonna happen to the egg. You can have it when the week is over and I have my grade.  Freakin' weirdos, man.
Yeah, that's why we wanna have a startup company.
Hey! Let's pour them in the teacher's coffee tomorrow morning.
Yes, but now we don't have any homework, so we can go see Timmy play downtown at Mile High Stadium
We'd have to put something up on the Internet that everyone would find fascinating.
So I'm thinking we do the part about Jimmy's relationship with his alcoholic father after you smash Butters onto the table.
Why would the government want people to believe they caused 9/11?
Jesus, this sucks! All they keep doin' is dancing around!
But that doesn't mean it has to go off the air. You should like that show. Your sense of humor is just like Family Guy.
He was out all alone in the middle of the night. Mr. Jefferson isn't even home.
Hey Blanket. Uh, look, we're goin' over to help my dad chop wood. You... wanna come with?
Come on! Everything's gonna be okay!  Sir! Sir!
Oh, hi. Is Chef here? We have to talk to him.
I can't take it anymore.  Why do people say "long story short"? They're not making it short, Stan.
What the hell does that have to do with American history?
Uh where should I sit? There's no place to sit down here.
I think he wants us to get in.
Dude, that would have to be like, the best party ever.
Just let it go with your fucking balls, you fucking asshole!! Your friends have been in danger and all you care about it this stupid bet! Well I've decided, Cartman, even if we had a bet, that I am never sucking your balls,  you got that?! They can throw me in jail for the rest of my life, but I am  never going to suck your balls,  never! So  there!
You need to stop recommending that app to people!
Don't worry. There's gotta be another cash for gold place around here somewhere.
Hey man, if you're Jewish you get presents for eight days.
How about we revamp the name? Super School News sounds dry.
Just take a shot or pass the ball, asshole! It's getting late!
Dude, that new kid is such a douche!
He didn't want us for sex, fatass! Something is making him say those things.
But, but he's lying! He doesn't have a conscience!
No, no, no! Don't become an angry mob!  The last time we did that we killed Jesus!
Wait. That's it. Atonement. Of course.  I know what I have to do now. Thank you, Father. 
There are greater things at work than what you understand.
They said we have to give them money that we make on the Internet.
If you guys want there to be a Christmas, you'd better come help me!
Dude, we're gonna see the new Zoopeeker movie!
Dude, you have to tell everyone. Right now.
Yeah, but maybe we need a name that's more affirming, like, shows what we stand for.
No it wasn't, fatass! I saw you do it!
Dude! I've never seen Cartman care so much about something.
Hey wait. I think maybe I have Attention Diffunction Disorder.
Cool. Thanks, Jimmy, well, I'll check it out.
And that applies to all of us, doesn't it? Even though it's convenient to have things done for you, sometimes it's best to deal with it yourself. 
Alright guys, listen up! This may sound a little strange, but, the whale, at the Denver Sea Park, is going to die, unless we get it to the moon,
Here's the thing: Whether or not I'm a part of it, crack baby basketball is popular. Somebody's going to do it. So the only way for me to try and help the situation is to be involved in it, so that I can steer things in a direction that is more beneficial to the actual crack babies.  Oh, it's sooo easy for you, isn't it? I mean, what do you have to do except lay there and think about what you did at school today, or what you want to watch on TV tomorrow? Well sorry, Skippy, but the world isn't always black and white! Just because some people are born poorer than others doesn't mean I can't enjoy a few McDonald's French fries in a hot tub of gravy from Kentucky Fried Chicken!
I don't want to! It's a stupid name! 
I know! But that doesn't matter any more! These kids don't wanna play the game, they just wanna watch people on YouTube play it.
We have to confess that we were the ones that-
Dude, we've arrived. We're super, awesome, and cool.
Uuuh, Cartman. We know how you can get $3000.
That's the most horrible story I've ever heard. Why would God do such a horrible thing to a good person just to prove a point to Satan?
We're not fucking you, they're fucking Stan's grandpa!
You're in a forest! Go take a crap!
Uh-uh-uh what do you mean "they've taken it"? Oh, this isn't happening! This isn't happening!!
Dude, if my mom knew I was in here, I would be in super big trouble.
You're telling me that every time you guys download an update for iTunes, you read the entire terms and conditions?
Did you guys hear that?! A hundred thousand dollars for a picture of Britney.
Yeah. I guess their rules did have a point. Things have gotten a lot worse in the ten days since they've been gone.
No, I'm serious! I wanna see what's happening downstairs, so let's just do it! 
What I understand is that you totally screwed me over!! So why should I have to listen to you?!
You too! Right now! #webelieveinyou! We've got to make him appear! 
We still have an hour before the costume contest, so let's hit the house on the uh-
Well, there you go, fatass! I hope you learned your lesson.
I think we can piece this case together now.
That's what you care about?! Who's the poorest kid in school now?!
We'll just have to keep throwing jabs to win the fight.
But we actually are busy. Tonight's the big fight.
Where is Cartman? He said he was gonna bring money for us to buy a pumpkin.
You mean he's actually stuck in virtual reality?!
Dude, this is the saddest commercial ever! Don't watch! 
This is how they talk to us!  You'd better watch your mouth, kid!
Well, yeah, but what if the grampa wants to die, cause he's really old, and he's just asking for help?
Ah- I was just sledding, and the next thing I knew my sled rope got tangled with a bus, uh. I gut dragged for over a hundred miles before the bus finally stopped for gas.  I'm sorry about your sled, Kyle.
You said we have no idea that you're never let us hurt Wall-Mart!
It would've been faster if Cartman hadn't slashed the tires!
Comments on commentators, it's all changing so fast.Playing XBox with your brother is... just a thing of the past.
Now with Ma on her iPad, and Dad trending or trying,All the family is scattered, and the living room's dying.
Because it wasn't the outdoors or church or even trips to go ski,
What brought families together most was a good old TV
Now we watch things by ourselves and just tweet what we saw.
And if you try to complain, you get called a-
Is this all you brought us here to see?
Principal Victoria, there's something you need to know! Cartman's Tourette's isn't real! He's faking!
Do with us what you will, Mr. Lucas!  But please, don't change Raiders of the Lost Ark.
Hey, it's a fire. That means there must be people. 
And that's why I feel like you guys are more than just friends. You're my family.  Except for Cartman.
You sonofabitch, Cartman!  You don't fart when you're locked in a small space with other people! 
Dude, I'm telling you. It's crazy. All my little brother wants to do is sit on YouTube watching this PewDiePie play video games. I swear, I don't understand kids these days.
Well, we got some cigarettes, but we don't think you should be smoking. Each year, over a million people die of smo-
I guess we should all realize...  that history and alien technology really do go hand in hand. 
Yeah. We've come to complain. We don't want a Wall-Mart in our town.
We only have one option. I've gotta take you to the surface.
No! Dude! I want the Terrance and Phillip dolls up there.
Not Cartman, he gets to be on TV anyway.
Look, dude, things around here have changed. Sometimes, the only way to keep going is to make a left turn.
Well, we tried, dude. If anyone else in this craphole hates Americans, we'd better just leave the goat and get back to the plane!
He's going to kindergarten because he's a genius!
Yeah, check this one out. Ready, Ike? Kick the baby!
Dude, you've been sitting at your locker crying since lunch break. Clearly, something's going on.
No. We just have to show him that there's other girls out there. I say we take him to Raisins.
A U-Haul. What if we bring Muhammad to South Park in the back of a U-Haul, and he just stays in there out of sight?
Everything turned out okay for those people. And so now you can laugh.
He was a McCain supporter.  It's okay, Ike. Obama will do fine.
Yeah.  And that means that McGyver is a real person too.
They're not gonna show that stupid-ass Godzilla movie again, are they?
Hang on.  Hold on a second.  I gues... I... guess... this is... goodbye, Willzy-x.  I'm gonna miss you.  Hey, don't forget me, okay? I won't forget you. 
Mom, Dad, you've always taught me that being direct and honest is a basic Jewish tenet.
He probably just ditched to avoid that spelling test.
Yeah, isn't he just supposed to be learning how to read?
Guys, stop, stop!  We don't have to do this!
Yes, I did! I said from the beginning that you would do this!
Hey, what happens to me in the future?
Yeah. I guess we gotta try to get into that club, too.
What's this comforter filled with? Um, it isn't filled with down, is it?
No, I'm not there. I'm at a hospital. I I'm hearing you in my imagination.
Nobody believes in you, not even my friends.
I found the number for a really cheap airline to Canada. If we go as soon as possible, then-
That's exactly what I wanted to hear from you all along. Ah uh I still have to take Butters, but... I hope things can be cool too.
I know it's hard to think about, but you have to be strong. Remember how that movie made you feel.
Doctor, could we talk to her for a minute?
Wait... stop it, stop it!  I can't let Kenny be sock-dried.
I just have a feeling this might be the last time we get to do this.
Ah! Ow! Hey, it hurts!  Owie-ow! Help! Ow, that hurts!
I don't care! You'd better remember where your base is!
You made us pull you to safety because you ate treasure?! You son of a bitch!
We... didn't realize what we were doing, eh...
Hey, Butters!  I got tickets to go see Lion King tonight, and I decided to invite  YOU before anybody else.
You son of a bitch! I won't let you win! You hear me?!
But how are we gonna get the balls put on Butters' chin?
Don't you think it's a little strange that Cartman keeps asking you to stay over?
Because- because that's not even entertainment! I mean, it's just, just, rehashing shit, isn't it?? It's like everything these kids are into these days, you know, it's just... rehashed shit!
How can we be passé? We're only in 4th grade.
Sssoo aside from all the bull crap, what do ya think of the Oculus?
Look, it may not seem important now, but your vote really does count, and we all have to do our part.
That's not true. Kids at school like us. Don't they?
Cartman, don't you remember the last time you had this dream?
I've designed it to be the best place for them to live. A place where they can finally have the care and happiness they deserve. And if you think it's a bad idea, I really don't care!
Hey, are you guys gonna come to Ike's party this weekend?
I should have known better! You never cared about my birthday at all!
But how are we gonna get to the North Pole?
Guys, we need to talk to you. I really don't think we wanna be a company that ISIS looks up to. We should maybe issue a statement saying that we don't sanction them.
Patrick Duffy? Damn it Cartman, that's not scary!
Four tickets to The Lion King on stage!
I told you Cartman, I'm not one of them! I don't wanna live in West Jersey any more than you do!
Uhhh-woo wow! Isn't this great? You guys seeing each other again?
I see... a man... with a baseball cap.  He's killing now... Oh! I'm seeing it all flash before my eyes! The guy's name is Michael Deets, and he lives at 621 Castillo Street. He's usually there between seven and eleven p.m.
Listen to me: the little boy who convinced you to pull the episode is a bastard child. He only wants you to pull it because he knows it will be the end of Family Guy forever!
Can you believe it, Stan? I never thought global warming could happen so fast. I guess... I didn't listen.
I'm just not sure this is the name people are gonna give money to.
You need to freeze some of your ass off.
I am no longer an XBox guy! I let my friend get grounded, but today I will give him a PlayStation!
Oh God!  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to-ah, I'm looking for my brother.  Ike??  What the hell is going on??
Okay okay... I love having Cartman's farts in my tummy. I love it.  I love it sooo sooo much.
There he is! Now, don't let him know we think he's a loser, or else he won't play. 
Since when you care about being sensitive to people's religion, Cartman?!
Hey. You're right, Wendy. Come on, Stan, we have to go get Cartman. 
K... what if we cover his face with a paper bag?
We don't know who else to talk to.
Judas Priest.  Wow! Downloading music for free is awesome! 
Wait a minute, the rights to Star Wars, the movies? What the hell is going on here?!
Don't worry. Everything's gonna work out. It always does.
Cartman, what the hell are you doing here?! You quit!
A hundred thousand for a picture of Britney peeing on a ladybug. Imagine what a photo of her crapping on a squirrel is worth!
No ending? Well, we can't animate until we have our voices recorded, so we'd better just record what we have and figure out the ending later. 
You couldn't get both arms behind your back, fatass!
Ma'am, we are a very important talent agency. If your producers knew you were forcing people of our stature to the back of the line, well-
They're saying something about taking over the entire country.
Dude, our town is going to be better without the-  What the?
They're just drunk, Cartman! As soon as they sober up, they'll stop.
Well dude, how the hell are we supposed to play it, then?
What's the matter, Mr. Hankey? Are you sick?
How are we supposed to name our startup company if every name is already taken?!
What am I going to do? My little brother's been abducted by aliens.  You farted. 
Dah.  Does that mean you'll go to the dance?
I'm going to try to save Stan and Butters from getting nuked!
And did you see her lazy eye? You can't even tell what she's looking at.
Dude, you can't do this! How can we be the Avengers without Captain America?
Alright, ahhh, why don't we do something else?
Uhn, you don't understand! My friend is in Imaginationland! I can hear him in my head!
Then why did Butters say he helped you sneak into my room last Friday night?! 
Dude, it just can't be better than ours. It just can't be.
I have to save my little brother! I have to send him away until my parents come to their senses!  Come on, Ike!  Cover me for a while. I'll find a place to hide him and come back.
Because without big corporations we wouldn't have things like cars and computers and canned soup.
You were right. You were right all along. I thought you were just an asshole when you ripped on Jews, but... I didn't know, I... I didn't know.
He didn't even seem like Chef. He seemed like a empty shell of a man.
Kenny, all you did after the cat peed in your face was start running around in circles cheering.
We could go to the city pool. They have a water slide
Did you guys hear what's going on? There's like four girls at the school now offering to kiss boys for money.
Don't try and stop me, Stan! You don't know how it feels to be a deformed monstrosity!
We made it! It hasn't gone to commercials yet. 
Ah, I thought we were speaking for the children.
Oh please, no reason! I got AIDS from him!
We told you they were real Cartman. Sorry to hear about your ass.
What has Michael Jackson always tried to be?
A break from what?! You haven't done anything!
Dude! Where have you been? I've been waiting all afternoon.
You mean that we're forced to pay for the Oprah channel?
Hey, Kenny. How much for you to eat this?
How much do we have left, Cartman?  How much do we have left, Cartman?!
Do you think kids in every town have to deal with this crap?
Sometimes I think I can see time slowing down,  and my own existence fading.
Dude. Are you sure that fish is a murderer? It seemed like a normal fish to me.
Like look at him. He's always shaking and nervous.
But if the tape must be brought to the House of Butters, who else can do it?
Hang on, I'm chaining my fire spells for max range.
I'm never speaking to either of you ever again! 
Don't you just feel a little bad for Clyde?
Yeah! Now, which one of you is the Cartman we can't stand?!
Really? Great! I don't have to worry about that anymore. 
I'm going to see the Queer Eye For the Straight Guy people.
Ike, what's the matter?  Dude, you've been in here crying all morning. What's going on?  Oh. My. God. Ike, a-are you sure about this?
How come you didn't buy any cards, Stan?
You saw it in The Thing and you're wasting everyone's time!
Okay. N-no, ah I don't want that much responsibility-bility. Here, you hold on to it, Kenny. 
What the hell is wrong with you, Cartman? Haven't you noticed the three feet of snow on the ground?
Kenny, aren't you a little young for this?
You can't! Poor Ike must be so scared, up there all alone. You gotta help me, dude! 
Wow, dude, check it out! We can win Terrance and Phillip dolls. 
Yeah. And we're sorry for turning Ned into a vegetable.
Hey you guys! You guys are not gonna believe this!
I'm making a dummy Ike doll. My parents think he's out with me right now, and I have to bring him back for dinner.
Both you guys, stop! Please. You're gonna make people hate us more!
No, the nipples are more in the middle, see? 
We don't know. They lost all contact with him.
Light is a wave unless it's observed? That means all matter is just a wave.  Nothing's real! Reality in a nuh- Oh God, it's happening! 
Look, let's just get our money from EA Sports and get out of this whole thing once and for all!
Will you stop with the underpants gnomes, Tweek?! We have to work here!  
Dude, what are we gonna do? We can't win this game.
Yeah. He was doing their voices and pouring tea for them.
No! Because you'll just crap out your butt and then say it came out of your mouth!
Yeah, and if you couldn't prove there was a leprechaun, you have to give me ten dollars! Now just pay up and stop being stupid!
Hey, that's it. Oh, my God, that's totally it!  It's so simple!
And you don't see any parallel between that and anything else in history?
Well Cartman, the South lost! That mean you're our slave for a month!
What uh, what are you supposed to be?
So, do you agree to fight him after school?
Dude, totally. With Kenny's Magic skills, we could probably kick serious ass!
Oh, thank you! I was so eagerly awaiting your approval of my abilities! 
We want to talk to who's in charge.
Man. Cartman's more screwed up than I thought.
Dude, because of the electoral college these votes in swing states can really matter.
You don't understand! Willzy-x is from the moon! He'll die if we don't get him back, now! Willzy-x, you have to talk! Come on boy, you have to! I know you're sick, but you could do it!
You'll never get a platinum album doing Christian rock, Cartman! It was a stupid idea then, and it's a stupid idea now!
Well, I- I invested in that IT thing, and there was a bailout, so I received a five million dollar bailout clause check, which, which I can use to help my family, so, I- I guess, goodbye, cousin. 
We have to go see Mr. Hankey at the mall, Cartman.
I'm gonna buy a Walkman with my half.
Yeah. You used to sit in the living room with family and friends to hear their commentary on things. Now you can get it with a little guy in a window on the screen. Someone who just comments on stuff. I mean, really? Who would even WANT to do that?! 
Well, it's 3:30; I don't see any god-damned underpants gnomes, Tweek.
I can't say "ookie mouth" and have Kenny spit down my throat at the same time. It's impossible. 
Thanks, everybody. I'm sorry I got a little crazy there.
He does kind of look like him dude. And Kenny thinks Cartman's Gordon Ramsay impersonation is really good.
Please, tune in and help get America's families back in the living room.
Hey Token.  You-you gonna watch the game tonight, Butters? 
Because you spent all of our money on those stupid rides, fatass! Now, either you're getting on a bull or I'm gonna break your fuckin' head open!
See, when you start invading people's privacy, eh thinking it's harmless to put up pictures of them they didn't want up - Kenny! - you start a domino effect that eventually screws everything up for everybody!
Well no, not really. It's the Kindergarten teacher, Miss Stevenson.
Yeah. And you know, now that I think about it, third grade wasn't all that great, either.
Well Stan, you want to know what I think?
That's not how a croc sounds, you fatass penis!
Erm, okay, I know. How about we go to the mall?
Don't let him touch you! You die if he touches you!
He won't listen to us, but he would listen to- Gordon Ramsay.
Well, Ike. You can tell Cartman that it's my triangle!
Wha?! Well wait, ahah I wanna see what happens here!
Chef, there's a new kid in school, and he's a total weirdo freak.
You bastards! Come back here! Coomme baack!  Damn it, we were so close!
Yeah, but now you can be friends with all of us!
Sure. Remember that time that that kid in the red shirt decided to go off on his own?
You did, dude! You drank his whole body!
It's just a marketing ploy by the network. Like that time they had the first male-to-male kiss with Terrance and Phillip?
Dude, what kind of sick joke is that? Girls suck ass.
Well, he is. It turns out that the bookmobile driver here was the one making love to chickens.
Ssso it was all for nothing. The whole time I was... eating farts for nothing.
Like you! Maybe you just need to let your hair down. And let's see how you look without those glasses.  Let's just... put those back on. 
All we wanna know is, who has our Okama GameSphere?
I'm supposed to go to the lake with my family tomorrow and swim and play in the stupid sun.
You guys, we can't give up on our dreams now! As soon as this strike ends, we're gonna be the biggest band ever!
I don't really see the fun in...  ...not trying to kick that game's ass once and for all!
Yeah, huh! You wanna go with us so that later you go, "Haha, I was working for Wall-Mart all along" or something.
But we found a frozen ice man from the past! 
That's great, Butters, but we're not playing Detective anymore. We're playing laundromat owners.
We've gotta move away. We've gotta get as far away from this town as possible!
No dude. Because since you got your feelings so hurt for being ripped on, now we think you're a pussy.
Dude, just ask Chef for help. He always knows what to do.
Dude, I'm not going to lose to Cartman's stupid turd sandwich. 
I'm not from Jersey. I was born here.
No, you're fat to begin with, chubby! Now you're Texan too!
What does me being a Jew have to do with anything?!
Maybe their baby will be still-born, like Cartman was. 
All right, fine, Cartman! You really want me to go in there, I'll...  Dude, Cartman, what is that behind you?
Whoa Cartman. Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night.
We don't even understand how this game is played.
We'll get back in time for a Christmas adventure.
Oh, so you know what mung means, hunh?
Dude, where in the world can Britney Spears go where nobody will bother her?
Well, Cartman, thanks to you we don't have any money left to win the Terrance and Phillip dolls!
Uh... W-uh... but... Come o- come on! Really? I mean, aren't there more important things going on right now?
Hoh Gohod, I popped it!! Oh hit huhurts!!
What does that have to do with Passover?
Wow! Oh, and look over there, that's that Jake Jabs guy from American Furniture Warehouse commercials. 
Then we should go to the record company. My dad's a lawyer, dude; he tells me about this stuff all the time.
It's not me! I'm here to help you, fatass!
Yeah. We have a report to do, asshole! Get up! Get up!! 
All the cruel jokes and ridicule will finally be over! Are you happy now, God?! YOU made me look like this!
These producers making a big holiday special!  They had me upload a video for a commercial they're about to air! They said my hash tag was awesome, and they wanted to promote it!
Until we get people to stop downloading music for free, I say we refuse to play!
What the hell are you so happy about, fatass?! 
I think you're awesome, Funnybot. Uh, but you can't go around taking everyone else's jobs.
...French fries... pizza... french fries...  come on, Cartman.
Is it illegal for Jewish people to eat Christmas snow?
Mom, there's sssomething I need to tttell you.
Original zombie? Well, how the hell do we know who the original zombie is?!
I don't get it, Kenny: why do you buy razors and shaving cream?
Fine!  Then YOU do it, you're so tough!
Kenny, what's funnier? A giant douche or a turd sandwich?
It wasn't my idea to burn the Wall-Mart down.
Look, we're from Colorado! We, we grew up in the United States.
Beause he's a fat racist self-centered intolerant manipulating sociopath!
Dammit! Son of a bitch, dammit!  Oh, sorry.
Oh wait. Hey AWESOM-O,  I'd also like some celery sticks chopped up two inches long, with peanut butter and raisins on top.
What should we do, dude? That big snake keeps growing; it's gonna demolish the whole state soon!
"The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few?" That was Wrath of Khan.
Look, Stan, we're really getting concerned about this cult that you're getting into.
Kenny's not really my friend, Ma. I don't give a rat's ass about him.
All right, you see, Clyde. Okay, we wanna help him sue whoever invented the toilet.
Yummy yummy yummy I want Cartman's farts in my tummy.
Why?! So I could be sitting in the hospital waiting to die, like Stan?!
We should not be wasting time and money making sure Cartman's fat scooter can't be tipped over!
So where are students getting all this cough medicine??  This surveillance footage shows a group of troubled kids getting all the smack they want from a pharmacist!  Sexy Action School News reported the pharmacist to the South Park police, and he was immediately arrested! 
Shut up Terrance, we can geneti-cal engineer anything we want.
They found the butt-face people's son, Butters. They're gonna have a big reunion at the milk company!
I don't think it matters, dude. This giant snake is gonna kill everyone soon. 
Somebody bet on you, Jesus. You said yourself that one person still had money on you.
We've got work to do Stan, I think it takes a while for an elephant to get drunk.
Cartman was visited by aliens again last night. And now it's like we're living a repeat of a previous day.
No. I found this frozen guy in the woods today.
No it isn't, you fat turd! Because, I've learned something today. You just hate-  See, I knew it.
Hello. There are certain networks that we see as harmful to our families, and we want them removed, please.
"What I Wanna Be When I Grow Up"?
Y-yeah, but… the color of someone's skin doesn't matter.
Well, let's try the dictionary.  queasy, Quebec, queen quelch. No queef.
We're gonna save our parents before they all kill each other!
Come on! Let's go make fun of him!
All right! Now, come on! We have to practice! 
No! I finally do understand! There is no justice! There is no God! Do you hear me?! I renounce my faith!!
'Kay, so now just click on the little soil button...  and then maybe put a sign up to comment on my farm...  Okay, now I can read the sign you put up...
I don't know, dude. It's like everyone's putting pieces together that aren't there.
They did it to us again! That dirty talent agency stole our client again!
Oh no, don't try to pin this on me! You're the one who brought it up!
And you don't see a problem with that?
If you want your share of the money, then you're gonna shovel snow like the rest of us!
All I wanted was to play one level of Call of Duty and you know what Ike told me? He said the living room was for old people.
I don't think Ike wants to go to Squirts.
I'm sorry. You must've been worried sick. I got your sled tangled up with a bus. 
You didn't think of anything, Butters! Guys have been doing what you're doing for years! You're nothin' but a common pimp! 
Well, I've gotta go start our animation. We've only got two days. 
Stan, do you pick giant douche or turd sandwich?
Well then we're gonna end up freezing his hellish heart with a cool island song.
When Cartman first opened the door, and saw the Thompsons, he felt bad for playing a joke on them. Now that everything's turned out alright, he's able to laugh.
I am sooo sick of that stupid bitch! Blabbin' pussy little skank! Why do people talk on their phone like that?! I can't even get a minute of piece before that bitch walks in, holding the cell phone out like this , and talking on speaker phone! Nobody wants to hear your goddamned conversations, you little bitch! You're not that important!
No, uh-I knew it! I knew it. I was just testing you guys. You just wait till I get to that Chinpokomon camp! I'm gonna be the toughest master of them all! So we'll see you there, a-ight? 
We live. That's what Indy would have wanted. We just try... to live.
We can get people to believe us now!
Yeah. No more getting pushed around by fourth graders! 
Oh, I'm swell, Stan. I popped my hemorrhoid trying to climb the fence into Cartmanland, and it got infected. I really need to go to the bathroom, but if I do, it will pop again and the pain will make me pass out. How are you?
City of Brentwood
They take really good care
of all their homeless
Well why don't you just tell people the truth?!
Ah I'm sorry, but I don't really care. I just want to know what medication my little has been getting from you, and why?!
Wait. Isn't there some rule about not getting into cars with strnagers?
We got Cartman's pig so we can splice its genes with my elephant's.
Time for you to get proven wrong, fat boy.
I don't know if that's gonna be too easy. 
There's a Hillary Clinton campaign rally.  Cartman? ...Cartman? 
Chef, the police are asking questions about you!
Kenny, we know you really like this girl, but...
That's not what I was trending! They took my hash tag and they raped it! Where is Ike?!
Yeah, he was too young to be taken from us.
No. And I don't want to. Look Stan, maybe we should fo- 
And then Craig was all like, "Tweek is scared o'me. He's a big chicken." And he started doing an impersonation of you being a chicken;  well, everybody in the world saw it!
It's hard to be a Jew on Christmas
My friends won't let me join in any games
And I can't sing Christmas songs or decorate a Christmas tree
or leave water out for Rudolph 'cause there's something wrong with me
My people don't believe in Jesus Christ's divinity
I'm a Jew
A lonely Jew
On Christmas
Channukah is nice, but why is it
That Santa passes over my house every year?
And instead of eating ham I have to eat kosher latke
Instead of Silent Night I'm singing huhash dogavish
And what the fuck is up with lighting all these fucking candles, tell me please?
I'm a Jew
A lonely Jew
I'd be merry
But I'm Hebrew
On Christ-maas
They sneak out during class and make out in the hallways!
This is just startin' to look like another one of those times where it-it's gonna end up with the whole town turning out, it's a big showdown happening, and us havin' to talk about what we learned, and I say we just stop right now, and go play cards or something.
Whoever it might happen to be, I'm not giving him the opportunity. Tomorrow I'm going to do something. Something I've known I would have to do restore people's faith.
I've tried, Wendy. I've called him, I've been to his house. But since his diagnosis, all he's done is gotten worse.
Cartman! What kind of stupid-ass question is that?! Of course it was fun!
But if I stop now, I'll just be going with the group again. So, to be an individual, I have to bomb Pearl Harbor. See ya. 
They didn't play the Terrance & Phillip trailer again!
Please? I need you to come sit down for a second.  So... Here we all are. Mom, do you want to tell Dad something?  Mom?
Just admit it, Congo! Admit that you lied about me to Irene!
I hear your parents might give up selling meth for good.
I thought you said the wonder of Mother Nature was a beautiful thing.
It sure is. Do you want me to watch it with you, Ike?
Hey!  Faith Hilling is not out of style, alright?
Well, unfortunately for us, he's now on the other side! We are out of options!
Love ...is the most important thing on... earth. When boys and girls feel ...love, they kiss.
"And as the voluminous corporate automaton bulldozes its way through bantam America...
No! You have to show Mohammad, Mr. President!
Oh c-come on, that can't be why they're all here. There has to be another reason.
Get up, Cartman! You're still not staying on long enough! 
We made it, Ike. You're going to be okay. 
I happen to be the one person who's putting everyone else's needs before their own!
No! No God damn it no! I'm telling you you're wrong! There, there's no way I can have HIV! Unless maybe...  Oh my God. That son of a bitch! 
But I always read that Native Americans were here, and that Pilgrims and other settlers kind of took their lands from them.
The girls do not have a device that shows them the future Cartman. That's retarded.
...Yeah. Or we could just show our asses.
Oh! Tha-oh, yeah, the the startup company thing didn't really work out.
No.  No, I want to have the Antichrist inside me!
Well it-... it's okay. there's no denying it all worked out for the best this time a-.
I can't watch the meteor shower with you, Kenny. I have to go to Jewbilee.
Well, you might have made it, but we're the ones who are taking care of it now. You have your own egg to look out for!
I told you Tom Brokaw doesn't have a mustache, fatass!
Aw, dude! You can still kinda see the spleen!  How much, Kenny?
Dude, I don't wanna see a bunch of guys' penises!
How can you be willing to kill people for a holiday special? What's wrong with you?
Butters was supposed to go with us to Casa Bonita tonight.
Why? Why, Mom? Because if I do something bad will happen to me? Because if I do your God might not shower me with his blessings of infected hemorrhoids?
Excuse me, this isn't exactly what I had in mind!
God-dammit! If we miss the commercials, I'll never forgive my brother!
No! All we have to do is not shop at Wall-Mart anymore! If you want it to go away, all it takes is a little self-control and personal responsibility.
Yeah! What the hell were we thinking?! Boooooo!
It was really important for me to get an A, Stan. And Bebe said you were so reckless with your egg, so I made a fake one for you  and kept the original safe with me.
Excuse me.  Do you know which way the network president's office is?
Is that what this is all about?!  You came up with this whole idea so you could get a stupid toy?! 
Wait. I don't know if this is cool.
Dude! Nobody wants to hear you commenting on things!
Buy me out?! What are you saying?! What makes you so high and mighty you can buy me out?!
Kinda like Cartman's dad shipped out on him.
We have in our possession something of great power.  It is... The Lord of the Rings.
If you do not accept treatment I will no longer give you money or be your friend. I will not help you kill yourself.
See? We're just watching cartoons, like always. Nothing's changed.
The reason Chef has been saying those terrible things about us is because he's been brainwashed! By this- fruity little club!
Hey, uh, does anyone know who that guy is?!
Eh now,  come on, you guys, we can't take this decision lightly. Whoever we pick is going to be the person we do everything with from now on.
Because they're an addictive solution to a greater problem, causing disease of both body and mind with consequences far outweighing their supposed benefits.
Well, that's a public school. And in it there are children,  just like us.
Butters, we are sick! Don't you get it?! We're gonna end up just like Kenny!
Well it's just that, eh, this seems like another one of those times when things are gonna get way out of hands, you know? It's been happening a lot lately. How about this time we just put a stop to it right now?
Then I was right. Job has all his children killed, and Michael Bay gets to keep making movies. There isn't a God.
No-no-no-no. Come on, fatass, we're gonna get 'em all back.
Just give me 30 minutes. Come on, Ike! 
No, it's still just some whiny, annoying teenager talking about how lame he is.
When Towelie is doing heroin, he doesn't care about anything.
I don't think my mom would want me doin' this.
Cartman, uh, all I was trying to tell you at Wall-Mart was that you-
Well, how about we just say, "corporates should be stopped"?
Now, wait a minute! Everyone just stop for one minute!  Look, you guys are gonna end up killing her. Can't you see that Britney isn't in any condition to handle this crap anymore? I know watching celebrities go down can be fun. Me and my friends are just as guilty as all of you, but maybe, we'll just, maybe, ...it's time to let this one go. Just this one time, let's, let's all stop before it's too late, huh?
Dude, you're just saying that because she's your girlfriend.
Oh, hey Stan. Where's your best buddy, Gary?
I didn't do anything to you. Timmy saw the turkey and wanted to get it. What do you want me to say to him?
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with dreidel I shall play.
Dude, my brother's in Milan. There's nothing I can do.
Ah, heck, Mr. Visitors, I'm just a kid all alone in this crazy world, but if you could find it in your hearts or whatever you have, to give my brother back to me, it sure would make my life brighter again.
All right, here we go.  Since the days of Copernicus, man has dreamed of flight. On this historic day we remem- aw, screw it! 
I'm not being in any  faggy boy band!
Yeah, you can't get it if you don't breathe.
Well. Dude, it's uh it's good to have you back.
They've just gone crazy for a while. Please, mister, I have to hide my brother until they come to their senses.
You should care! This strike affects everybody, fatass!
Towelie, over the past few months I have watched you go from an ancillary character with a few amusing catchphrases to a dried out spooge rag covered in the jizz of a thousand older men.
God, that was not cool at all, dude!
I can't, Mom. We're working on our school project.
I need to get a nurection for my dad.
There's really people out there without a Facebook friend in the world? That's so wrong.
Uh, sir, d'I have a lot of homework to do tonight and I was-
Dude, this guy's trying to rook us! We can go someplace else!
No, Cartman, we can't do it on Raymond again! It has to be on a current event in South Park. Tweek, do you have any ideas?
No no, he's right! We've gotta make it for someone in need so that people have to go.
Sorry Ms. Cartman, but your son took some things that didn't belong to him.
Hey! Isn't there where Stark's Pond used to be? Where we used to kayak and fish?
That can't be. My parents wouldn't lie to me.
I don't know what else to do, dude. No matter what I try, me and Ike just seem to drift further apart!
Fine,  then we'll shut our cable off altogether!
Oh God! Oh God! I have to tell the truth!  Mooooomm! 
This part kinda sucks, Kenny, but don't screw it up. 
We've gotta do something, Chef. If we don't we don't stop that network,  "shit" will become an even more acceptable word!
Jimmy, you're got to explain to the Germans that this is your fault, not ours!
What are you doing with cats in your attic, fatass?!
Wow, I wish we had a stupidest home video. 
Well I wish I didn't have any parents! 
Ah I was just trying to... just, just in one instance... No. No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
...Excuse me, I have to step out for a minute. 
Aw man, at least the real Jesus didn't weigh 400 pounds!
Token actually pays attention in school! Unlike you, fatass!
Dude, dressing up like Hitler is not badass!
Oh, my God! What the hell is that thing?! 
NO. I can't, Wendy.  All his negativity is starting to make me depressed. I have to let him go.  And whatever happens next, I'm going to embrace with a totally  positive attitude.
He's a talking piece of poo that lives in the sewer. But now he's getting sick because his egosystem is all out of whack because of all the extra poo in the sewer. If you don't all leave and go home soon, Mr. Hankey's gonna die. He's one of my best friends in the whole wide worldeh, and I don't want him to die. 
But you're lying to people. If they knew that you didn't eat just all the sandwiches you want, you might not be so popular.
Doesn't anyone understand the significance of "I'm sorry" anymore?
And this kid is watching Cartman commenting on people commenting on Dragon Age.
You want Tammy to give you a B.J.?
Holy crap, dude!  Hey look! He's got ice cream! 
Come on guys! We gotta go tell Chef he's in love with a succubus.
You can't sit with us, new kid. Go find another table! 
Can someone help us? My little brother fell out of a window. 
Please, sir. I came because I don't think Ike belongs here. Family isn't about whose blood you have in you, family is about the people who cared about you and took care of you. We're not the same blood, but I love my little brother. We've taken care of him because he needed us to, and that makes us more family than anything. 
And then we won't have to show anybody the picture Kenny has of you guys sucking each other's jagons.
You've always been a dick to me, Cartman, and I'm not inviting you. 
Mr. Garrison, seriously, I have to go. Can I please be excused from class?
We can't give him over to the gingers!
How is it that Ms. Ellen was suddenly arrested for being an Iraq-
There is no such thing as a funny fuse, Cartman. You felt bad.
It's unbelievable, Stan. EA Sports just used us the entire time. We worked for nothing and EA made all the money. You know, I don't think we actually deserved getting screwed over but, but I guess making tons of money off of people who are making nothing is always gonna cause problems. I know, I know, right? We might've got screwed, but the really tragic thing is that those, those poor crack babies at the hospitals are just gonna be stuck there, with nowhere to go.  No way!  This is it!
Hey Texans! Let me through; we want a treaty!
Stan, we can't be seen with this nutjob!  Aw, aw, awww!
Look out! Here comes the great dragon of Perengraph!
Well, who really cares what that monster is outside? As long as we stay on the bus, it can't hurt us. Right? 
What?! Timmy! You've got to get off that chair!
Well I don't know. You're just the only grownup we trust.
You did it, Mr. Hankey. You got rid of all the film people!
I know it's hard to believe, but you have to trust me.
I actually hugged you. I held you in my arms and, and, cried with you.
So you crapped out of your mouth! Good for you! It's still stupid and immature! 
Why the hell would you want three copies of the same movie?
Stop it! Stop!  Oh God! Oh God, help us!
What the hell is wrong with these people?!
Wow, I guess this really is a big deal.
Eh... hey, Cartman?  You really don't care that you can't go?
Uuuh, Chef, you haven't seen Butters around, have you?
Jesus, it's freezing out here. He, he could be dead.
Come on, limey, don't be a wuss! Are you just gonna be a little French pig your whole life?
Yeah. I hope he makes his Salisbury steak with buttered noodles! 
Dude, this is probably the best episode they've ever done!
You can't do what he wants just because he's the one threatening you with violence!
No. This Saturday, for my birthday, my Mom says she's takin' me to Casa Bonita, in Denver, and I get to invite three friends!.
Singing a Christmas song isn't gonna get you nice deductions, Cartman! Don't forget: it's because of you that Santa's sleigh got shot down!
I'm going to put it in my room, where Cartman can't find it.
How can they make a show out of this? I wasn't even agreeing with them. 
Oh this is sweet. I've seen this episode.
Oh dude, check it out. I got a Jake Plummer.
Look, however hard you think it for you, it's a lot harder for him!
Try it.  We'll see you in a while, we got to go get Cartman's pig.
See? There you go again. Look at you dude. Look what you've become.
The judging's almost done. You're gonna make it.  Oh God.  SOMEBODY GET ME A CHARGER!  Hold on Stan! Don't die on us!
"So this is how America works. We have gods and clods. My dad says America needs both rich and poor to survive, but I have a better idea."
No, see? There's people of all colors. And they added a black guy as one of the hangers, too, so it's not racist.
Hey Stan, we're gonna go to the movies.
I-Ike, this is a big deal. You have to be absolutely, 100%-
No, Cartman, we're going in there and splicing Fluffy and my elephant together.
I have to watch out for my glasses. Ow! Ow, it's so cold! Oh Jesus! 
Well, I... kind of gave a homeless guy twenty dollars last night.
I'm not better, I'm just... doing what needs to be done to make the world a better place.
Cartman, that's the dumbest thing you've ever said - this week!
Okay. But you've gotta promise to not complain.
Hey, fatass! Instead of laying in bed eating, why don't you come and help?!
He worked so hard, come so close. Now we'll never see Kenny crawl up into Ms. Crabtree's uterus.
I totally know how we can give the gingers and the celebrities what they want, but keep Muhammad safe. Come on! 
I wonder how come Cartman's not in school today?
The new girl liked me, and so you lied to her!
Mine neither. But I double-checked, and Cartman was right. Your period is the start of puberty.
Dude! Dude okay! Stop! I'm sorry!  Says that you are currently... hosting an online chat party for all your friends.
Yeah, you're a great Meheecan, Butters, just not a great leader of Meheeco. 
I... because the world is at peace. I must endure.
You know something? I think that's good. It was wrong to make Timmy a singer.
Dude, hold on! This is bullcrap! If they wanna live in our time, then they should learn our language!
Tattle-tale?! Do you know how serious this is?!
Yeah, our friend has been missing for a few days, so we went and checked on him, and he's in a coma wearing your headset.
Yeah, we're the Goonies, Cartman. Why don't you pretend like you're the fat kid?
This is it, Stan!  It's just like I designed it. There's the miniature gold course over there! And slides and uh,  excuse me, what is this place?
Uh I'm trying, Mr. Mackey, I really am.
He catches the feesh so, then he can make money.
Mom, Dad, what exactly are this party for?
I know, but dude, we can't license our games to EA Sports and pay the crack babies nothing. Slavery is illegal.
Whoa Cartman. Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night.
How come we never get opportunities like that?
You wanna kill me?! Fine!  I can't live like this anymore! Go ahead! Do it! 
Cartman?  He's not gonna open it. Break it down.
The liposuction is a process of siphoning out the excess fat. 
Wow, I didn't know golf games were this cool.
Come on, Kenny. You have to get in the circle.
But why not? You said sometimes people need surgery to make them feel better about themselves.
Is that what you learned in sex ed?
Because then you can pay us to use our friend in commercials.
Ike, don't do it! There's still so much to live for!  I know you really wanted McCain to win but, but it's going to be okay.  No, that's not true, Ike. The economy could easily stabilize with Obama's plan.  Ike, don't jump! You could really hurt your ankle or something.  Really Ike, that's like five feet off the ground. Don't do it.
Look dude, it's just one movie. We wanna have a good time.
Well, I'm sure glad this is all over with. Let's go count our candy.
What the hell is going on?  Hello?  Excuse me, I need to get to Los Angeles.  Hello?! 
Damn. That guy is the coolest guy in the universe!
Dude! He got Brent Musberger for a leg!
The South loses this battle, Cartman. They lose the war!
Sorry, sorry. You know how after we spent the night at Kenny's house and-and you and Cartman got sick with chickenpox?
I saved up enough to buy M-80s this year.
You're watching someone play Call Of Duty and talk about it?
Well there's nothing you can do, so you just have to be patient.
Mr. Jackson, please, you're causing a lot of problems.
Hey Stan, did you see that rainbow this morning?
Come on guys! He's hidden them somewhere and we have to find them!
Ike, I don't know what to do. All the guys are getting their periods, and I don't think I am. I can't be the last one to get it. I just can't!
Hey. We paid for the sea people too. How come they're not making statues of us? 
Well, what about those two college guys next door to me? They're always doing science experiments in their basement.
We're here dude. Just a little further and we can finally end this.
He is working for the Wall-Mart to stop us from succeeding!
I was just explaining how a negative argument doesn't make a po-
Didn't you hear? They outlawed fireworks 'cause a little boy blew off his hands.
Yes, Mr. Garrison, I have to go now.
Um, we... sssort of spend all the money on this... one...
Well that goes without saying, fatass, how could she help but look at you!
Dude, come on Cartman. As employees, don't you think we should get to see what the final secret flavor enhancer is?
Okay, I got a text of the Russian guy's podcast. It's all a bunch of links to eBay.
He was very brave. He risked his life so that Mephesto could live.
Yeah. I think we should get the hell out of here.
Well, let's just try to finish all this coffee, so we can stay up.
Dude, when he gets out he's gonna be really mad!
Butters, Butters, I'm, I'm kind of super busy right now.
From public school, your house is just a flicker of light.  Don't you want to go out? All you do is... stay in your house and... study
But how can the Jews make it better??
I'll call the producers of the show. They'll help you find your dad.
The outside of the device seems to be covered in numerals. Inside are colors... which must open up to some sort of temporal time warp.
Oh, thanks.  Dude, that new girl's into me!
We're missing out on some quality video game time right now.
Like a..big hunk of dirt with a carrot sticking out of it.
Lots of people will when I tell them!
But we certainly want to thank you for all your hard work and attempts at being our friend, lame as they were.
Gee, you seem a little stressed, Mr. Garrison. Why don't you try some Ritalin? 
That thing is pretty cool. What games did you get with it?
No, dude, you don't wanna bring your people to Mexico, there's missionaries there, too.
We understand you just sounded like a freakin' racist!
Chef, CHEF! You need to get out of here before you get arrested, all right?!
Yeah, I think that parents only get so offended by television because the rely on it as a babysitter, and the sole educator of their kids.
You didn't see a leprechaun, fatass! If you could prove it, I had to suck your balls, but if you couldn't, you had to pay me ten dollars! Pay up!
Aw, come on. Ned's faking it. That frog was just a piece of plastic!
Cartman, stop! You don't know what you're doing!
But I'm gonna be Royal Crown Chinpokomon Master!
Seriously, Cartman. You could make money with these!
Come on Starvin' Marvin, I want you to meet my little brother.
I need one ticket for my little brother.
Ex, excuse me?  My name is... Brad. And uh I need to report a crime. Anonymously.
I just want a nurection so I can give it to my mom.
Do you hear that, Stan? It worked! We've shut down the veal industry!  Stan? Stan?? 
Stan, people in Beaverton are still trapped on their roofs. Nobody's helping them because they think they can't go outside.
Well, as Abraham Lincoln, I accept your surrender, and agree to your conditions. You and all the Confederates will have all the S'more Schnapps you can drink for a year.
Look, we're just trying to show you there's other girls out there.
Okay, so now you'll help us take care of Trent Boyett?
Dude, you don't understand, I'm a Jew. I have a few hang ups about killing Jesus.
There! You see?! This is what happens when Cartman is allowed his right to free speech!
Please, you guys, you don't understand.  My family is devastated. My mom just walks around the house like a zombie, and my dad can't stop crying.
Yeah. And I can still get my A!
Yeah. You know, I've learned something today. Family isn't about whose blood you have, it's about who you care about.
Wait. I thought you called your planet Marklar.
Not if you... have some delicious farts for me.
If it's on the school network we can track the IP address.  This way. In here.  Whoever it is using the computer in the music room.
Get him!  Whoa, Tweek! Did you hear that?
When an artist creates, whatever they create belongs to society
I can't take it anymore! I gotta go volunteer, dude! 
What?!! Sick, dude, I'm not kissing a girl!
Okay. We won't tell anybody as long as you are super nice to us, every day, from now on.
I endure what I must for the sake of all humanity.
Alright dude, we were going to the movies.
We’ll get my dad to be Chef’s lawyer!
Hey, Jesus! Ih-if you win the fight, can you turn Kenny back to normal?
Oh okay, but did God sent Jesus TO die, or did Jesus just get kind of screwed over.
It's not lame, it's sweet! After we build this clubhouse, we're gonna get girls to play Truth or Dare!
Cartman? Come on, dude. You have to get up.
That can't be true! My parents wouldn't do that!
Dude, L. Ron Hubbard was a science-fiction writer. He lived on a boat with only young boys and got busted by the feds numerous times.
Awwgh! Hey dude, we don't even have enough weight to move.
You sent us over to Kenny's house on purpose! You wanted us to get sick!
You bastards. Listen, we have to give a huge speech tomorrow about corporate takeovers.
Well, Cartman, this is just my opinion, but I think the Line Ride sucked donkey balls!
Give me that!  Hey! It hit her right in the mouth!
He said his wish is not to die. 
Tango, this is Foxtrot. Are you in position?
There's no Jews in San Francisco, you retard!
He's gone, dude! Butters says he saw him leave.
Wow, level nine already? Dude, you kick ass in "Heaven versus Hell."
It always has been. See? This is nice. 
Uh. My adopted brother got taken back here to Canada? So, we want to talk to the new Canadian Prime Minister about getting him back?
I think the rabbit just crapped on my jacket.
That's two against one, 'cause Stan doesn't care. So it's giant douche.
I know that I often have serious moral objections to the things that you do, but... this time I think you really need to reconsider, because if you do this, I believe you will go to hell. So I feel it is my responsibility, as your friend, to tell people what you're doing, and to put a stop to it!
They got us a truck, and an airplane, and Mr. Worf! The calves are gonna be okay!
Jambu! Jambu, why didn't you speak up before?
Set an open course for the virgin sea...
We have to speed this up!  Uh, can we collect our Internet money in front of you, please?
The Earth show can still be good. Just erase everyone's memory so we don't know we're a show.
Yeah. I've changed mine three times already 'cause it itches so much.
I mean, come on guys, that's pretty cool, right? My little brother is a knight in Canada. 
Kenny, we need to have a serious talk.
How come the visitors aren't coming for him.
Cartman, what is going on out there?! What happened to Stan?!
No thanks. We're trying to unbrainwash our friend.
Excuse us, we're trying to get a picture of Britney Spears!
Aww gee, that's... so sad. Everyone should have one Facebook friend.
Jews do NOT carry gold in a little bag around their necks.Cartman! Stop playing around!
Yes, yes, hello? Is this Mr. Su-gi-yama with the Japanese space program?  How much to take a whale into space?  Nu-no, we don't want you to eat the whale, we want you to send it to the moon. How much? Jesus Christ! Uh hang on.  Hello? Jimmy, any luck at the Chinese Embassy?
Yes. Yes, I do, Dad. Now let me tell you how it works in the real world. In the real world, I can either get a Chinpokomon, or I can be the only kid without one, which singles me out, and causes the other kids to make fun of me and kick my ass.
No. You know what? Screw this! We aren't ugly!
My company was on Kickstarter too! Why would I get rid of it?!
Dammit!  Ike, if you wanna keep your penis, you have to get on this train.  Ready, Ike? Kick the baby!
Mom, Dad, have you ever met Ike's kindergarten teacher? 
Fine. That's it. I give up. Have fun being miserable.
Rotten, they're both really drunk, but the won't have sex.
Oh, Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay.
Ogh. Oh cool, she likes basketball? That's perfect! Thanks, you guys!
They're just taking Indiana Jones and they're...  they're raping him! 
You... bastards!  Wha, what the hell is wrong with you?? What kind of Prime Minister bases his decisions on hatred?  And, and takes away mounties' horses?  And French people's wine? What the hell kind of Prime Minister are you, anyway?!
We don't have time for this! Kenny, keep him away from us! 
There were no good times! And if he really feels bad he can just tell me himself!
He's right. We have to take a hard stance right now and establish that we're the dominant ones in this relationship! 
That's it.  I'm going to combine my elephant with a pot-bellied pig and make…pot-bellied elephants.  They'd be smart like elephants, but small like pigs.
You don't wash your hands after going to the bathroom!
We came on our own 'cause our friend's purity ring is killing him.
Yes, yes! Now the Jews shall take control of Christmas once and for all! HAHA! HAAA!!
Well, our friend Marvin and all his people have to live on a part of Earth that sucks ass. They can't grow food or nothin'.
Well just hurry, Butters. You can probably make it back in time before the first commercial break.
And we think that that is  a savage hypocrisy, because all crimes are hate crimes. If a man beats another man because that man was sleeping with his wife, is that not a hate crime?
Yeah, maybe that just kind of what they do naturally.
Stop saying "hella," Cartman!  How are we gonna win the contest with a squash?  Whoa, Stan. You don't look so good.
We're all here today because Chef has been such an important part of our lives. A lot of us don't agree with the choices Chef has made in the past few days.  Some of us... feel hurt... and confused that he seemed to turn his back on us.  But we can't let the events of the last week take away the memories of how much Chef made us smile.  I'm gonna remember Chef as the jolly old guy who always broke into song.  I'm gonna remember Chef... as the guy who gave us advice to live by.  So you see, we shouldn't be mad at Chef for leaving us. We should be mad at that little fruity club for scrambling his brains.
Mom? Can Kenny go to Jewbilee with me?
Cartman, you need to stop this stupid little game you're playing!
They were wearing cowboy hats!  Did you see??  Did you see?? 
But that is what happened! It is! Tell them, Cartman!
Cartman? Your side won, dude. Why are you so sad?
Stan, you don't get how cool Facebook has become. You can message your friends, play Yahtzee with your friends, even start your own virtual farm and have your friends visit it.
Did you send the videotape to America's Stupidest Home Videos?
Dude, everyone's trying to figure out who you are.
Why did they search us? That marijawana never even made it to us.
Jesus Christ, you can't even walk down an aisle to get your candy? 
Aw, hey dude. What are you doing here?
Come, on, Kenny! I'll give you five bucks to do it!
Well? Are you happy, Cartman? Butters is completely traumatized!
Get out of my way or I'll kick your ass!
It doesn't matter. Because God is going to harden the Pharaoh's heart!
Well, Stan I have to harvest my crops before it's too late.
Aw, that's just a rumor. They don't really track y- 
Wait. It's okay. Look, maybe these people all turned out because they believe in saving films. Maybe they don't even care about the free hats.
Sssss-so ...Bebe ...didn't become smart and cool? It was just her boobs?
No, it's great! It's just what this country needs right now!
You better! 'Cause if you don't find a cure for HIV, I will break your Xbox!
It's perfect! I could take her to a basketball game.  Man I I don't know what's happenin', but... it seems like all the girls are... kind of into me lately. 
Look, he knows full well what he's doing, and he's just waiting for us to buy into it, and then he'll laugh and point at our faces and say, "Haha, I got you guys to believe me!" "You guys are stupid!"
Because! Everyone is suing everyone else, and you're pretty much the cause of it all!
Cartman, do you even know what's going on? We went to Imaginationland, terrorists attacked it, and now the government is about to-
The thing is, Ms. Claridge, we did a lot of stupid things when we were kids.
Listen, you don't have to do this! Our imaginations aren't running wild anymore.
But dude, there must be something in your past you're not dealing with.
Please you've, you've got to believe me! They've still gotta be here somewhere! Uh we've got to find them!
They didn't believe me. They thought I was pitching a movie.
Not if somebody took pictures without her knowing.
See? You can still make it for the end of the party.
Do you think we did a good thing, Stan?  I mean, no one even seemed to notice.
I can't deal with it, Stan. I mean, all the stuff I've been reading; I really don't think I exist!
Do you mind telling us what the hell is going on??
Yeah, I hate you, but I'm not going to help kill you.
But before he could go through with this entire plan, he discovered that the pie had already been eaten...  ...by your dog. 
But that sucks. I don't want something to have that much power over me.
Oh that's,  yeah that's good, that's good. Alright, chapter... one...
Uh, I must have the wrong number. We were trying to reach City Airlines.
All that time and effort we spent helping Token and this is the thanks we get?!
Noo, I'll just... be... going back to bed now.
Well, a lot of people like Family Guy too! Who are you to decide it shouldn't be on the air?!
We've had just about enough, dude! You've been blowing us off for two weeks now! What's up?!
How hard can it be? Look at it. 
Well, we can still pre-tend like we know what it means.
Dude, why the hell would you DO that?!
You son of a bitch! I won't let you win!
Don't call Mr. Blaine a gaywad! He's a brilliant man.
Dude, what do you mean "We don't have a coach."?
Yeah. Check it out.  Ready Ike? Kick the baby!
We have reached the Great Pass of Mount Ururalak.
Who the hell reads that entire thing every time it pops up?
From who? We can't ask adults for help and there's nobody tougher than sixth graders.
Alright, we don't know for sure why Cartman is ditching school, but it has something to do with abortion. That's all we know.
Did Cartman just say "shitballs" to the principal?
He'll view it as a challenge when he's getting his ass kicked!
They're evil! I WISH I DIDN'T HAVE ANY PARENTS!
Do you know how to start a fire?
I'm sorry, Cartman. There's been a little change in plans!
It just seems so unfair. People won't ever even know that the wrong man is in the White House.
What do you mean, "can't"?! You made it work; just build us another one!
Should be the next one. 2778 Mala Vista Drive. Wait, this is City Wok.
Hey dudes.  Sorry I couldn't make it yesterday. What'd you guys do?
Did you play the Terrance & Phillip freemium game all day?
Do the right thing. Show Mohammad.  Do. The right. Thing.
No, dude. They only changed "terrorist" to "hippie" to make E.T. more P.C.
Yes, I believe that you believe you helped write that joke. That's how people like you work! Your ego is so out of whack that it will do whatever it can to protect itself. And people with a messed up ego can do these mental gymnastics to convince themselves they're awesome, when really, they're just douchebags! 
They never grow old because they die before they're 30!
We need you to protect us... from a bully.
I need to book one trip to the moon, please. Right away.
Nancy Kerrigan got the silver, dude. She came in second.
You know what I mean! Why is my little brother watching you talking about us talking about him?!
Revamp how? The rules are that the fourth grade class has to perform the Helen Keller Story.
Oh. Then what the hell are we talking to you for? Come on, guys.  Hi, are you Elton John?
That's what the sixth graders do behind the school at recess. They take way too much cough medicine because they say it makes them see things in their heads.
And Cartman for having a whore for a mom.
Goodbye, Ike! Be safe! I'll come find you in Nebraska when Mom and Dad are back to normal!
Where are you going?  Ike, where are you going?
No I won't, because you'd eat 'em first, tubby. 
If only we had realized how special our time with his gigantic ass was.
You've been on your fucking phone since we started!
Llook, I know I'm not the best-looking guy in town, but I I didn't think I was the very ugliest.
Hey! Don't try to pass it back on me, fatass!
I've even unplugged it and plugged it back in.
You guys don't even make a six-layer burrito!
Oh, brother, here we go again. Cartman, there is not a sound frequency that makes people crap their pants!
Then that's it. I'm... I'm never going to get my brother back. 
Now she's doomed to walk the earth in limbo. 
It's not a presentation, it's a hate speech! People aren't creeped out by gingers!
I wrote down... all the lyrics to the Happy Days theme song.
It's this place called Des Moines. It's like, lost in time, see?  Everybody looks like you do.  Fashion is two years behind, Technology is two years behind, fads, are two years behind, just like you. 
...But what if I do a bunch of chores around the house? Come on, you're being unfair!
Dude, it's Cartman. He's just being a dumb-ass like always.
Can we please just try and talk to him?
In there? But it's very confined. I'll get cramps in my legs.
Oho, we will. Trust us. We won't miss this. 
Come on Eric, we can go play at the bus stop.
They're goin' to show the new Terrance & Phillip trailer
All right, then we go with the plan. Just like "To Catch A Predator".  The first guy is here. This is probably HotForBoys219. 
It is not stupid, Kenny! This is my faith and you shouldn't make fun of it!
We're gonna teach that fat bastard a lesson!
I've been trying! But I just don't know how to make totally new friends on the Internet.
Wait. You guys, I have an awesome idea! We should secretly go around and tell all the students we can, to not check any of the mascots on this election sheet, and instead write in "Giant Douche."
Uha, wa, actually, I- I can't eat beef. I have a degenerative problem with my intestinal lining, and beef really gives me gaass.
Well... what kind of stuff does she like? Do you know?
It's too late, fatass.  They'll be here in less than a minute.
Ike! Do your impersonation of David Caruso's career!
No, my little brother's been abducted by aliens.  It's true! Ask Cartman, they gave him an anal probe.
Wait a minute, that thing landed on Kenny, and they took him to the mortuary.
But we promised the Earth Day people you'd perform.
And afterwards, he'll probably have to burn his hand and bury it.
I said, 'Larry King won't grant me three wishes.'
...Oh, and I hope one day to be an investment banker.
I'm going to break everything that you own! 
They said that Chef works in one of these buildings 
If she holds his hand in that theater it'll be all over.
Ask her if we get the watch right away.
He just... He just... stopped breathing. And it was over.
What about Dan Rather? Do you think he's real?
I do not sound like Cartman goddamnit!  Okay, so, see ya. 
Date-rape something. Yeah. Okay. I will. Okay, thanks, Mon.  I don't have to go outside!
Hey, thanks for going through all that to save my life, Stan.
Did you hear that, dude? We still get $3000. That's enough for you to do your DNA test.
No.  But I get Channukah presents for eight days.
But it's gotta be perfect. We're trending well, but we need to attract more followers who want good old family values.
Mr. Hankey.  He comes out of the toilet every year and gives presents to everybody who has a lot of fiber in their diet.
Goddammit, Chef isn't like that! Something funny is going on around here!
Hey, why don't we watch some of those porno movie thingies?
Let's just get this over with, Cartman. You won the bet, here's ten dollars.
I know. It's like we have the outdoors back again.
Dude, I think it might be best for us to never piss Cartman off again.
In there! Let's go!  Get this jamb on the door! 
So then, she's gonna be seeing other people? Is she, sort of, available?
What if we do a show where we-  Uh, no.
Wait. The U.S. Government has a portal to the imagination?
Are you saying that Ike has been given regular doses of hormones because of an IntelliLink screwup?!
Oh God! Look, I know you got Asperger's from the school and I I'm sorry. But your negativity is poison to me!
Ike, I didn't tell on you, you got busted by the hallway monitor.  Okay, okay. I did have something to do with it. But someday you're gonna realize it was for the best.
With his power, I can finally make the earth a better place for the Jews!
Wait a minute. According to this you now own all the rights to Crack Baby Basketball and we got nothing.
Hey. Me and Cartman and Kenny are going down to Happy Burger. Do you wanna come?
No, I don't have sand in my vagina! I just think it's a little immature for us to be standing around talking about one dumb word being on TV!
I knew Kenny couldn't fit in that tea pot! 
Well, he screwed us by makin' something up; I say we do the same thing.
But I'll get snow on my gloves and then it will melt and I'll have wet hands.
We know he's dead. We mean, where is his body??
Yeah. Did you make out with him, too?
Bye-bye seeme mama.  Ah, I'm gonna take him up to the bathroom to get washed up. 
The Queen and King of Stan'ses house wish The Lord of the Rings returned to them.
Well like we said, we didn't know whether or not we should care?
Yeah, sweet! Maybe we can get a reward for the frozen guy!
Stan, there was never anything between Wendy and I.  I wouldn't go out with my best friend's ex-girlfriend.
Don't listen to him! You still have a chance to preserve your film! 
Wow. That's a lot of sea men you've got there, Cartman.
Trent Boyett is being released from Juvenile Hall.
Oh yeah?! Well you're a stupid Jew! You're a Jew! Shut your God-damned Jew mouth! Good job, Jew! Jew... Shut up, Jew! You're Jewish!! Dude, he's Jewish! Jew! Jew! Jew! Jew! Jew! Jew! Jew?! "I told you Jewish people don't have rhythm." "Fuck off, Cartman!"
They saw us on the tour.  Dude, where do you keep going, Cartman?
That's because there is no goo, Mr. Cruise. You see, I learned something today. Throughout this whole ordeal, we've all wanted to show things that we weren't allowed to show. But it wasn't because of some magic goo. It was because of the magical power of threatening people with violence. That's obviously the only true power. If there's anything we've all learned, it's that terrorizing people works.
Clyde got $3000 from his mom's life insurance
Look everybody, I know we all feel our hands are tied, but the fact is, we can do something about this. There's an app which can actually allow kids to block things that their parents watch on television. And it is password-protected with a security code that only a child would know.
All I wanted was to play one level of Call of Duty and you know what Ike told me? He said the living room was for old people.
Dude, I can't believe they fell for it!
Hey, that might work. But it can't be a party for us.
Aww, come on, you guys! It's supposed to be really cool.
If we win, we can buy a new go-cart that actually runs.
We have to find a way to get the word out! People need to know pushers are being hired to take advantage of people with addiction problems! There has to be a way that we can get to the news company, and sneak in and somehow borrow their TV signal. If we could disguise ourselves as something ridiculous, then-
You can't believe it?? He does this shit all the time!
And Stan for being in love with Wendy.
Just do it again, Cartman, and don't make it talk! 
Hey! What the hell are you doing inside my little brother?!
I wanted to get Ike out of his room, so I invited all his friends over for a slumber party to play Dragon Age: Inquisition.
Come on, Ike, we can make it just in time for dinner. 
Wait a minute. There's only four of us.
You just wanna lock me in there because you think I'm one of them.
Stan, I told you. My mom doesn't want Ike playing hockey. She thinks it's dangerous.
...You didn't save everyone, I did! You were just out harassing Muslims!
Oh my God! You did lie to me.
Right. But in the 1340s people in England stopped calling it "skite" and started calling it "shit." The same year as the Black Plague.
Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo
he loves me and I love y-
You guys, that's not cool. These people have nowhere to go.  They don't have food or shelter. We have to do something.
Nah, I can't. We should help look for him.
You, you paid your friends tuh...  not make fun of me?
Alright, that does it, Cartman! That's my grandma! You show her some God-damned respect!
I was in the bathroom when you were talking to Butters, Cartman!  I know what-
If you really think every kid in America should see your anti-bullying movie, then why don't you put it on the Internet for free?!
Will somebody just get me to a hospital? I need to get my stomach pumped!
Then don't eat 14 Egg waffles for lunch, fatass!
Hey... Hey, we know a place! We know a place where everything is just happiness and joy. And no humans are there to mess it up.
Sorry, dude, but this fruity little club isn't taking our friend!
Hell no! I'm not being part of a four-member boy band! We'll look stupid!
Come on. I'll tell you all about what happened to me. 
Man, I would have loved to seen to seen the look on Trent Boyett's face when all the sixth graders showed up!
Well all right, we'll see you on Saturday, guys.
Uh, we need to go to Canada. As soon as possible.
Aw I don't think he wants to play, dude.
Come on, dude. We've gotta get out of here. I don't know what they're planning next, but it can't be good! 
Yeah, I hope they protest TV shows forever.
Man, I can't believe how much people want us to get our winning ticket back.
All right, let's see.  Dammit Kenny, that's not what she said!
The Diamond of Pantheos.  She must be powerless now.
Hey Cartman! We're almost to level 20! You giving birth in there, or what?
Oh, man. I can't just sit here, I have to help my stupid brother, or I'll come home without him and my dad will start yelling, "Where's your brother, Kyle?" "You weren't looking out for your little brother, Kyle?"
I just wanted to see if maybe you want to do fingerpaints with me.
'Cause, r-tard, he's Stan from the future. He knows everything Stan knows.
She did, but now they're saying we have to start going back to school anyways. It's totally gay.
If it'll make you leave me alone, then just take the damned thing! Here!  There. Now, get out of my house! And I hope you feel really, really good about yourself!
All right, look, there's gotta be other Third-World countries with space programs. We've gotta split up and find someplace cheaper, that's all.
Terrible. Every time I close my eyes I see the house we TP'ed. I see the tears of our art teacher and hear the screams of her daughters.
Why the hell would they want that anyway?  Episode I sucked balls.
Vi, Visitors, this morning you took my little brother, Ike. He's the little freckled kid that looks like a football. At first, I was happy you took him away. But I've learned something today. That having a little brother... is a pretty special thing.
Wait, wai- I can't let this happen.  Butters.
Well, I guess it's mostly the way Mr. Garrison stuck a gerbil up Mr. Slave's ass.
Pot's illegal too, but people still manage to find it. Ever since that first time Kenny cheesed, he hasn't been the same. You've all noticed the change in him. I'll bet Kenny's at home cheesing right now.
Dude, I don't think this is very sturdy. 
Dude, we've gotta hurry home! The final episode of Lost is on soon. 
Just, you know, make some money off him. Like Honey Boo boo.
A-ah! A-a-ah! Wha? Where...? Oh. Oh dude. Oh, it was just a dream. It was all just a crazy dream. Huh, oh my God. 
Alright Cartman, I've been doin' a lot of thinking about how the company's gonna spend the money we make off the EA Sports deal. We're going to use thirty percent of the money to build an orphanage for the crack babies.
Thanks for saving us Stan. You're my Super Best Friend.
Here, give me that.  "I am Bumbly Wumbly. I live in the pond."
Kenny didn't have the ticket stub. It was in his room. So we got all our candy, and you can all go home.
Then stop saying you're not just sure, you're HIV-positive!  This isn't funny, AIDS isn't funny, dying isn't funny, so shut the fuck up!
Uh, can you take my stupid glasses and put them on the night stand. Make sure they're close by, because that fish upset my stomach and I might need them if I have to go to he bathroom later on.
Mr-&#160;! Goddammit. Here, come on. We need to clean that up. 
How, how long do we have to take the shuttle?
Maybe you should go talk to the counselor.
You must have a mom.  You mean she doesn't live here, or she's dead, or what?
That people shouldn't sue each other all the time.
Uh, hi, we want you to end this strike. 
The only way you can cancel it out is to get Butters to put your wiener in his mouth.
Let me out of here, kid! Why are you doing this?
And then we ran out of the Kum & Go and these guys, th-they took our friend.
Well, it isn't a guy teacher. It's a woman.
Yeah. Cartman's weight was what gave us speed, so we need to find the next-fattest kid besides Cartman. 
Oh my God, this book says that negative and positive are the same thing; that real and not real are one.
I won't believe it! I won't! I have to ask my mom and dad! 
No. We can't, dude. We have to win the Terrance and Phillip dolls.
All Wall-Marts start a self-destruction sequence if you break a mirror in the back.
All right, all right, you could be Jesus, you tubby cry-baby!
Whoa, hang on! We shouldn't be learning how not to get caught. We have to take responsibility for our actions. 
Dude, what the hell? Somebody's gotta stop him.
Maybe it's better you don't know who your father is, Cartman.
So can I go to the Magic Camp, to learn how to become a full member? All the other guys are doin' it, and it's only $69.95.
You're just jealous he's a better psychic than you.
Dude, I guess we've just got to try it without him.
Well? Now what are we going to do?
Oh dude, we are gonna get it now.
Yeah? Well Butters is ten! He doesn't exactly know what's best for him and neither do you!
Because now he's acting like gingers are awesome. And all his friends are gingers. When he wakes up tomorrow and realizes he isn't really ginger, it'll be hysterical!
Dumbass, if there's sixty percent of them to forty percent of us, then who's the minority?!
I'm going to the kitchen! This is stupid!
I can't wait to get out of school and get our Teiko sports watch.
Because I m-I mean I really think you could have done it for about $12.50.
Hey, you're not such a bad guy after all, Damien.
We're making the news more appealing to students.
Then don't belittle my people you fuckin' fatass!
Holy shit. Then this is all real. We've all been here from the beginning. Taking turns on the Oculus Rift headset.
What the hell did you do that for, Kenny?!
Ike, we could go play the game downstairs. Isn't that better than watching some guy on YouTube playing it?
So wait. Do we do that spin-around thing on the last beat?
Look, Cartman, I don't know what's gotten into you, but... I I think it's pretty amazing. And I think it's real. You have to understand why I didn't believe you before.
I want you guys to all meet my friend. 
Calm down, Tweek. There has to be a rational explanation.
Alright, here it goes. Cartman, you aren't really here.
Let me ask you something, Jimmy: What happens on level 2 after you get the Ontario Nugget?!
Sir? Sir, can we talk to you for just a second?
Hey. Wuh I'm giving a speech tomorrow about people with red hair and freckles. Can I ask you a few questions?
Well I didn't have her do it. She did it on her own.
Dad, if the school has to pay you and Cartman $1.3 million, where does that money come from?
You get a platinum album for selling one million copies, you fat turd!
Listen, this is all you need to know: the economy is not a supernatural all-knowing entity. The economy is just an idea, made up by people, thousands of years ago. The economy is not real. And yet, it is real. Nowadays they'll give credit to practically anyone who applies for them.  I applied for this yesterday to prove a point. It is an American Express Platinum card.  It has no spending limit.  Do not be afraid! This is only plastic. It's just something made up by people. Truly meaningless until we put our faith in it. Faith is what makes an economy exist. Without faith, it is only plastic cards and paper money.
Dude, boars are only worth two experience points apiece. Do you know how many we would have to kill to get up 30 levels?
Wow. There must be at least 20 people out there. 
We need everyone's help here. What you're looking for are big boxes of ballots. Hundreds of them. Please check your basement, your attic, and-
Hey, how do we know if she's pregnant?
Cartman, there's something I need to tell you.
You're not filling out nicely, you're fatter than ever!
You're a fat skank, Mom, and your tits belong in a morgue. 
Well what the hell are you doing?! This isn't gonna work now!
A band! Holy shit, Stan! Didn't you say your dad knows somebody who knows Lorde?
Phew. The one videotape is sought after indeed.
Your husband.  He wanted that pie badly, but he knew that he was not allowed to eat it yet.
We need some more fur.  I think that's good.
Oh my God, they killed Kenny. You Bastard!!!
Look, I doubt we could break a million together anyway.
Look, Stam, we-we just wanted to be able to go to the movies and enjoy ourselves, you know? I'm sorry but... you're a bummer to be around. Everything is "that looks like shit" and, and "this is shitty!"
Oh! Hey Cartman. We're playing dreidel; you wanna try?
Off the air? But... we're just going to try to get the Mohammad episode pulled.
This whole time your stupid story was just a way to rip on me for being Jewish at Christmas again!
Dude, are you sure you wanna do this? Apparently this guy has a black belt in karate.
Heee might not come if you're too close to the toilet bowl, Ike.  Come sit by me. 
Yeah, sorry dude uh, I can't make it either.
Why? Why do I have to accept it when I can change it?
Just let it go, dude. You only had sixteen dollars and twelve cents. Count all your losses and move on. He's smarter than you.
Abraham Lincoln has been dead for two hundred years!
We need to genetically engineer our pig and an elephant, but their genes won't splice.
Don't try and stop me, Stan! This is what my grandma wants!
Hey, come back! We didn't even get to do our play. 
We believe that films have to be taken away from people like Steven Spielberg and George Lucas because they're insane.
Did you guys ever see that one Brady Bunch where the guy... 
Hooray for the earth! We must protect it.  And now, as promised, here are TERRANCE AND PHILLIP, on video! 
Yeah.  Hey Riley! Try this hamburger.  Cartman made them himself.
Dude. I don't think I wanna be a part of this anymore.
God? Please, if you get me out of this, I swear, I will never play with weapons ever again.
Nono, after we found Cartman, I put the headset on and then-
That if he could prove leprechauns exist, I would suck his balls.
Well, I don't know...  and I'll bet Cartman doesn't know either!
E-excuse me, w-we aren't going back now? Aren't we done?
Well we got tickets to see Terrance and Phillip Live in Denver tomorrow night. We paid forty bucks apiece for them.
Yep. But I guess this proves that war is the natural order of life.
Okay. since my dad's a lawyer, he says we can use any of his books we want.  Who wants to read them? 
Just admit you were lying, Cartman, so that everyone can go home!
Yeah. The more distance between me and the others from Jersey, the better I feel.
All right, Kenny, let's go!  Kenny?  Kenny!  Don't worry, Kenny. You didn't die for nothing.  We're gonna get Wing back as our client and... and make a ton of money! I swear it to you!
Ohhh, no you don't. That isn't gonna work on me, Canadian!
Hm, I wasn't really going for "gay," I was more going for "wholesome."
Then I can give it to my dad. 
The-that's not the right way to look at it, I-
(No! That's not what I said! Vanilla paste!)
Hey! Look at that line!  It's way shorter.
We're just gonna fly to California and break into George Lucas's house. What's stressful about that?
Ten million?? Well that's more than the Germans want!
Look, maybe he's forgiven us. I mean, we were only in preschool
No, Butters. Look what it's done to you. It's made you even lamer than before.
Oh, so the gallant knight now comes to rescue me from the bowels of mediocrity! Oh, thank you, your royal lordship! 
I was... I was just going to get a drink of water.
How do we know which one to use?
I can't believe how cold it is out here.
Yeah. I cross-referenced his MySpace page with realtor.com. His parents moved into that green house on Janice Street.
That's it Cartman, I'm outta here!  Chatroulette is no way for me to find new friends! 
I thought you didn't care about Wendy anymore.
Baahir Hakeem.  Born in Chicago, eight years old, his favorite color is green... Car, Cartman, what is this all about?
We have great news! Our friend has lost forty pounds eating your City Wok food. Here's the before and after photos.
Heh, don't, don't tell him what it is, dude.
This is where we all stand in a circle and pray to Moses for guidance during Jewbilee.
Now look! The reason we're in this situation is because people are being stupid! The economy isn't some vengeful being that takes things away from us. The economy is just made up of people, and people have just lost their faith in it.  What people really should be doing is spending more. Spending is fine. People should just go outside. People should just go outside. They should buy the things they need for their friends and family
It isn't fair. Cartman's fatter than the goal.
I'm not cheesing. I've never cheesed once in my life.
If someone says they saw a Sasquatch, they are either lying or they are stupid. Now stop lying about a Jewpacabra before stupid people start believing you!
I don't have a choice, dude. I'm gonna swallow my pride, face Cartman, and say "Congratulations. You were right" And I'm gonna give him the ten dollars. And hopefully, he won't make a big deal out of it.
God damn it! I don't want him to jump over more a-
But it's... it's not true they... have no souls. 
Yeah, dude! Kenny just died eight hours ago from that monster! How could he have died back then, too?
Don't know, but it kicks ass.  Wow, dude, you're the luckiest kid in South Park.
If we take him to the hospital, they're gonna find out what happened.
The knights of Standards and Practices were created to make sure that bad words were kept to a minimum. "Curse words" They're called that because they are a curse. We have to go back to only using curse words in rare, extreme circumstances.
Give it up, Kenny! You're not gonna win that costume contest! Your costumes always suck. 
Wouldn't it be better to just agree with him and forget the whole thing?
We think that you might have could it by helping make "shit" an everyday word. 
I didn't see a handkerchief. Did you see a handkerchief, Kenny?
Oh yeah. Tom Cruise does have Seaman on his back.
Mom. Mom. I found out all about this great new magician named David Blaine.
No, Cartman. You said nobody will have to be grounded. We're not playing dirty!
How much do you think Mr. Mackey needs?
Jesus, dude. W-w-what happened? It's like, something's lowered the bar to the point that nobody feels any shame anymore.
Car... Cartman! You've gotta swim! Kick with your legs!
I'm not inviting you, Cartman. You can't go.
Uh, Timmy, if we back to the other kids with that turkey they're gonna be pissed!
But you need to understand: we have a whale here that needs to get back to his family on the moon.
I'm... glad... that you guys can just keep living. I don't think I can. 
Hold on. Ah, I'm, ah... n-not right now. 
We're not letting you back in the band, Cartman! Fuck off!
Why didn't you tell me, Stam? I would've helped.
If we're playing outside he shows up completely wasted and, and screaming how the government is following 'im.
What?! You said we had plenty of money, Cartman!
Yeah, the High Elf. He'll know what to do. 
Ungh, it said in my book that the word, "shit", started exactly the same time as something called, "The Black Death".
Please, Ma. I don't think Kenny has anywhere else to be tonight.
It's not too late to do what's right. Give us the print. There's still some good in you, Mr. Lucas. We know there is. 
We did it guys. We finally taught Cartman a lesson. I'll bet that now, Cartman is gonna have a long hard think about how he treated gingers.
Okay, will you let Muhammad come to South Park if we dress him like a pirate?
They told us that "Phillip. He's the one with talent. Just get him for Earth Day."
Rainbows are those little arches of color that show up during a rainstorm.
They told us he has a m-muscular disease. An and, that ...and that he, he might die. 
Get out of here, you piece of garbage! You wanna smoosh, go creepin' somewheres else!
We've got to get rid of them.  Nobody should have the kind of power Barbra Streisand wanted! 
You dumbass, Cartman! Now they're gonna go squeeze his balls!
We went through all that just for some gay video of Earth?
Mom, Dad!  They're gonna kill her! They're going to in-. Wait, what are you doing here?
Cartman, he's got everyone on Sony's side. We can't stop him!
That's not true, fatass! I have red hair, and I don't have to avoid the sun!
All right. Thanks for your help, dudes.  Well, we did it, guys. It wasn't easy, but... we did a really amazing thing.
Excuse me, is this really what you think she should be doing right now?
I'm not putting my finger up Cartman's butt!
All right, let's just say all the bad things said about Mr. Jefferson are lies! Let's say the police department does just go around spending their time framing people for crimes they didn't commit!  Let's say it's all made up, and Mr. Jefferson is just a nice guy who's trying to be a child because he never got to have a childhood. Well that's fine, except for that he HAS children now! And when people have children, they have to grow up!
We can't deal with you saying "hella" anymore, Cartman! You're going to the other universe! 
-slashed the bus tires in Arkansas! I said so! I told you the minute that I-  -and I told you that-
That's, that that's k-kind of what I was thinking.
Your girlfriend doesn't even like you, Stan the Man! She likes me!
Did we?! Maybe we could have stopped them!
It isn't fair. I spent weeks preparing my speech on Latino culture.
Twenty... million?  Are you nuts? We don't have that kind of money.
Of course it smells like ass, retard. It's a sewer! 
Hehe. Why the hell did you dress up like Raggedy Andy dude?
Thank you for seeing us, Mr. Johnson. We were hoping that maybe you have some kind of key that can help us with our disease.
My name is Kyle Broflovski. My friend was raped last Memorial Day weekend. And, and I  I'm gonna help prosecute the men responsible.
Dude! Timmy's chair is packed with all that stuff! We've gotta help him!
Ike, please. I know your first love seems like the only love, but trust me, it's not. You have so much life ahead of you. 
You don't need that! Get off of it.
Yeah. We'll be the "Save Films From Their Own Directors" club
Yeah. I think maybe everything is gonna be okay now.
Stan, we're almost there. You've got to hold on.
We need help! Our friend is in a coma!
Please, I need to talk to the people inside. They can't set off that nuke.
If she wants to be with you, how about you have her tell all these people here?
There. Did you see? He just flipped you off.
There's a lot of holes in the Theory of Evolution too; it doesn't mean it's wrong.
Yeah, there's this guy named Jack Leborkian that goes around and murders people that ask him to, and he doesn't get in any trouble at all.
Okay, then let's take him to the hospital. You hear that, fatso!  You're goin' to the hospital!
It was like having the life sucked out of you. That' all it is, sliding down a cable. Maybe without a tour group it'd be ...kind of fun. Maybe. But, this was just... a complete disaster.
NO, why the hell would you keep eating something that made you crap blood?!
People aren't gonna support our company if we dig in our heels and say we don't care about anything!
Damn, you sound pretty sick. Maybe you should go back to the hospital.
You probably should come clean and tell the truth. Did you superglue your bracelet?
I DIDN'T THINK THERE WAS GOING TO BE A GOD-DAMNED LEPRECHAUN!!
Officer Barbrady, I wanna declare Shenanigans on this carnival operator.
Yeah. I bet they could make a fake set of balls. Come on, Butters!
All right, where are the missing ballots?!  President Obama?
All right, fine! We don't need you, Butters!
What part of being infected with a deadly disease do you find funny?!
...No, dude, it really isn't cool. You all turned your backs on me. You're supposed to be my best friends and you just... treated me like nothing! And now you all expect me to just forget it all and, and hang out with you again like nothing happened?
All you need to know is I'm way awesomer than you think, okay?!
Just stop it!  Stoop iiit!!  There's a logical explanation for that.
Wikileaks.  It says here his name is Wikileaks.
Yeah. I'm sure whatever that Super Adventure Club does is pretty tiring.
You just hate smoking, so you use all your money and power to force others to think like you. And that's called fascism, you tubby asshole!
Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo. Haven't you guys ever heard of it?
Well, maybe Mr. Garrison is wrong. You should ask somebody else.
That's more than ten bucks, you stupid fatass!
But you accepted money from the Canadian government! To push a freemium game on us! Why would they do that?!
D-ude, I totally miffed that middle part. Did you see that?
Uh oh. I guess we shouldn't have made him eat it. 
She's not eating it, it's just coming out her backside!
You don't know what you're talking about, fatass!
Come on, Cartman! How much do you wanna bet the South doesn't win?!
Broflovski looks for Kenny to get clear for the pass.
...No, dude, that's not the trailer for Terminator 5, that really happened.
Yeah, I just... well I just thought our company name would be more like uh... or-original
Do you know what happened to me this morning, Stan? This morning... I woke up and felt a sharp pain in my ass. I felt down there and, and found this... big sore lump. On my ass, Stan. I couldn't even sit down, so... I, I had to tell my mother, which, which was humiliating. She took me to the doctor, which was more humiliating, a- a- nd he told me. I-I have a hemorrhoid. It's like an infected blood vessel on your ass. I'm nine years old, and I have a hemorrhoid, Stan. I have a hemorrhoid, and, Cartman has his own theme park.
I am taking it personally because Cartman is a retard! Just because he hit his head and went into a coma doesn't mean he's a- Wait, that's it. If I want people to listen to me, I just have to be as stupid as Cartman.
Right. But he can't live with the guilt anymore. Because, even if Jesus wasn't really the Son of God, he was still a nice guy. And he didn't deserve what happened to him in Mel Gibson's movie. I I can't sleep at night. I mean, my... friend can't sleep at night.
Cartman, what the hell's the matter with you? 
Stop being a pouty little bitch 'cause you lost, Cartman!
Look, we've just gotta get Chef alone. He won't listen to reason with that hooker around.
Well, actually, Cartman's getting a nurection. But then, we're gonna give it you. Sooo, buck up! 
What the hell have you gotten me into?!
What the hell do you think you're doing spreading this crap to kids?!
Nonono, we're not going into one of those cheesy places, Cartman!
Did you eat too many pork rinds last night? 
It's no use. There's nobody around for miles.
Come on! Let's just get in our sleeping bags and get this night over with.
That's retarded! You didn't come up with that experiment, Cartman, you saw it in that movie, The Thing!
This is when you gotta get mean, Tweek.
Oh, God.  Wuh. Aah. Get out of here!
Okay, now put one end of the tube a half an inch into the incision. 
Uh…yeah…we want to crossbreed an elephant with a pig.
Don't try to take me away again, Mom and Dad! I told you! I renounced the Jewish faith!
Wow uh, you think it takes forty dollars to get people to like me.
Stan, you can use family love as a weapon against Shelly.  The next time she's gonna kick your ass, just tell her, "Shelly, you're my sister, and I love you."
This place is rad. Look at all the trees and stuff.
So, how are things going at Cartman's theme park?!
Eh-heh. L-look, if you want an explanation, you you'd better go to Kenny's house.
Mom! Dad! I have awesome news! The doctor who gave Mr. Garrison his sex change said he can make me tall and black. 
He probably thinks if he apologizes to everyone, we'll think he's changed and let him back into our circle.
I can seriously hold my breath longer than anybody. Somebody time me, all right?
How exactly are we gonna use her to scare them?
Dude! I almost thought those Afghani kids talked you into not liking America.
Don't you "Oh, brother" me! She's the woman of my dreams!
Dude, they've been doing that for a long time.
Hello, ma'am. My name is Kyle. And this is Cartman. We'd like to share our interest in David Blaine with you.
Cartman, what the hell are you doing?! You're suppsoed to be studying! 
So... why would one come to America to warn us about a terrorist attack.
Well how come Kenny's family eats frozen waffles for dinner and has rats on the floor, and we have a big house and lots of food?
Dude, an awards show just for comedy sounds like a bad idea.
I just don't know what to do. I mean, I hate Cartman with all my heart, but I can't stop feeling ashamed for taking advantage of him. But should I feel ashamed? Oh, whatever lowered the bar is not my fault. So if I kind of go with it, is it really unfair to Cartman?
She had a contract with us first! We own her!
Because we're not referring to gay people! You can be gay and not be a fag.
Well if I'm going down, Cartman's going down!
Dude! He turned Kenny into a duck-billed platypus.
How many ways are there to take it?! It's just a stupid word!
Charlie's right! I'm not gonna let some fake Mr. Hankey spoil my holidays.
Get out of here, Cartman, we're eating dinner!
We don't know where Cartman is, Ms. Choksondik!
Rebecca, there's this dance, see, the South Park Elementary Bay Of Pigs Memorial Dance, and uh, now I was wondering, ih-ih-ih if you wanna go.
I don't need Ike listening to you comment on anything!
Aw, I just hit my nose playing dodgeball.
Oh, like you know what pain is! Go try living in a Third-World country, you little pussy!
But our teacher, Mr. Garrison? He just had his penis made into a vagina. How come?
I knew it! You didn't plan 9/11 and you really didn't shoot that guy!
Yes. I'm saying one-fourth of Americans are retards.
...Okay Cartman, what do you want this time?
He just stacked his Shapeshifter with an Elven Blade!
Yeah dude, like, full-on. Ike saw everything. It totally makes sense now. My mom's been ordering all kinds of stuff from Amazon lately. Sometimes, sh-she doesn't even remember what she's ordered. She's probably been having sex with the UPS man for a long time.
I'm in big trouble, you guys! We have to do something!
Steve, you don't have to freeze yourself. Look!
But they said we can't charge the front door.
Yes, people can get hurt. That's how terrorism works. But if you give into that, Doug, you're allowing terrorism to work. Do the right thing here.
Hey guys. Guys! Hold up.  Hey uhm, you're kind of friends with that Nichole girl, right?
That quest sucks, Cartman! Think of another one!
I got it! I got my Chinpokomon game controller! 
How could we know she would... Aw we suck so hard.
Oh my God! Our GameSphere! You've gotta move me closer! 
Hey! Hey, let me out of here! This is a mistake! I agreed by accident!
It's crazy, dude! They're saying it's because I agreed to the latest terms and conditions on iTunes!
Google him. He's this guy from Sweden who has over 30 million YouTube subscribers. We didn't even know, but he's a bigger celebrity to kids than anyone. It just seems so lame.
But I thought we were supposed to care on Thanksgiving.
Dude! Every time we play Americans vs. Bosnians, you cheat!
Because you just said, "here in my room"!
It's that ring. Somehow, putting on that ring has turned Kenny into a boring turd.
Hold on everybody. This thing isn't even a-
They're TV dinners. Don't you wanna take that veil off so you can eat?
There's four white birds!  This is what Grandma wants? She wants me to attend Jewleeard.
No dude, we can't go around showing our weapons to people. Our parents'll find out we have them.
I'm not going to help you freeze yourself, Cartman! It's a stupid idea!
I got it! I got it! According to PayPal, the Russian guys are just hired mercenaries who had ads up on Craig's List and got paid through eBay so that Boston could be attacked by... the British.
Oh God, what have I done?!  I'm sorry. Please, I don't wanna be the vessel for the Antichrist.
"You know he can't think on his own, Kyle!" "Brush and floss, Kyle!" "Where has that finger been, Kyle?"
Cartman farted in there! We had to breath it in for 20 hours!
I know, dude! Let's get the hell out of here! 
Yeah, hey, do you think we'll get in trouble for watching it?
You wanna bet?  Let's go ask my Dad right now!
That's what bothering you? Not the fact that you're a murderer?
Stan, I don't think we're supposed to be in the military base. They might shoot us.
I TIVO every episode. We can go to my house and see what they did.
No, wait. No, we have to stop them! They're raping him. Rape!
Dude, you don't want your first kiss to be something you paid for. It's supposed to be special.
Huh, Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastard! 
Ah-ah-ah-are wooden desks all that available? I usually prefer the plastic ones because these give me splinters.
No, ah I didn't lie to you. Ah I was um... uh I felt better and then the guys called and said that they felt better and uh-
Hey Ike, you wanna come watch TV with me?
Yeah, what kind of name is Pip anyway?!
No no, it's n-it's not like it sounds. Here, check it out.  See look, we just video the babies fighting over a ball full of crack. It's really getting popular!  I mean it, it's cool because like the commercial said, the crack babies had nothing before.  It, it's great, because everyone wins, you know? You see that? Two million hits.  Did you know they're putting bacon inside of pancakes at Denny's?
See, w-we're the official presidents of the Terrance and Phillip Fan Club. A- and... we're... going to see them tomorrow 'cause we can get them to perform at the Earth Day festival.
Because, dude, we're playing detectives! Detectives don't just go tell on people.
All right, I've had just about enough of this! They told us in school, and on TV, that most people in Pakistan and Afghanistan like America.
...And in conclusion, the Latino community has provided America, and indeed, the entire world with innovations that we would be lost without. And that is my presentation on the role of Hispanics in American technology. Thank you. 
I- I can't do it... I can't do it. I...
All right,  check it out, I-  Butters, BUTTERS. What the fuck?! Are you peeing in the pool?!
THIS is the reason why our living rooms are dying!
This fat fuck thinks he's PewDiePie! Because of him I can't get Ike to come out of his room!
Dude. What the hell is wrong with you?
We are raising money so that Chef can hire Johnnie Cochran to sue you!
Well, then you gotta ride it out, Butters.
He said the Muslims beat them here-  God damn it!
Dude! We're not digging up my grandma; I'll get in trouble.
These people aren't going to prove anything. To believe any of this you either have to be a liar, or stupid.
All right, mister! You better have a good explanation for why you didn't show up to play ball!
Okay. Just be careful you don't end up naked and jacking it in San Diego. 
Yes it is a big deal! Why do you think everyone washes their hands after they go to the bathroom?!
I can't wait to see him!  He's gonna be so glad we came!
I know your family's poor, but you can't just eat an entire bowl of mints for dinner.
All you ever do is talk about your balls!
Wow! I guess reading really does suck ass!
Suddenly, Stan says he knows about some horse stables. Ih it seemed too good to be true.
...Remember when life used to be simple and cool?
Yes, ah I'm trying to locate my parents. M-my name is Kyle Broflovski. Yes, I know Obama won.
It's been a week since Ike's been gone, and every day my parents seem worse. I have to try to go to Canada and speak with the new Canadian Prime Minister, but I can't do it alone.
Ma'am, please, I think my little brother needs immediate help.
Look, we don't have a lot of time here, okay? Can you just tell us where the new Prime Minister is?
Hey! I'm doing it to save little baby cows. I'm not gonna stop eating meat altogether.
Butters! He got a ninja star stuck in his eye, and we were taking him to the vet when you fucked it all up! Butters!
Come on, Tweek! He's only got one arm!
All right, cool.  Let's download some Metallica, and some Stevie Wonder. 
Uh, could you use it in a sentence?
Coach! Coach, I'm all better. I'm ready to play.
It happens to be called poutine in Montreal! 
Dude, did you finish your math homework? I kind of lost track of time last night.
Sally Struthers, dude. She used to be on Full House.
But it's not fair! We have to do a full report on the Founding Fathers, and Cartman got out of helping us again!
Congratulations, sister. You have heard the noble truth and are now a Blaintologist.
Oh. Well, come on, we're playing L.A. Noire.
Yeah, but something is wrong with my brother and it might be your fault!
Come here!  You're not actually buying this crap, are you?!
I don't know. We just have to get it to town and let them figure out what to do with it.
Garrison is taking us all on a field trip today. He wants to do the final egg check in front of the Governor's office!
Can I just get some Goddamned tater tots?
Well, everyone in the world thinks you are. See ya. 
Ike, that is enough! If you're interested in Call of Duty, go play it downstairs in the living room!
No, Cartman, I have no idea what you're talking about!
There's some terrorists or bankrobbers or something that have taken our class hostage!
Yeah. But I have to say, I feel a lot better now.
I'm sorry Token, I had to tell him. His life is in danger.
I can't just hide my whole life, Butters. And besides, I have this strange feeling that one of you is gonna totally betray me. 
Come on, dude. I wanna get out of here.
Could I please one of your piping-hot farts in my mouth?
Well you made me eat veal and didn't tell me what it was. So go ahead and be angry, you baby calf-killing bitch!
Uhhh, how d- how do we start this thing?
It's okay. Everyone, it's okay. Perhaps one day, you will all understand. What I do, I do because I care about each and every one of you. 
No it isn't, it hurts! I can't believe they let us play this in school.
Well, I- guess we'll see you in school tomorrow, Chef.
Yes, I know that! Why do you think I've been putting up with his farts?!
Don't listen to 'em, Cartman! I'm sure it'll work. Go for it. Yaaay, Cartman! Fly, fly, fly!
Don't worry, dude. That little truck just runs on D batteries. It's gonna run out of juice soon. 
You might as well just say Pilgrims and Indians were all aliens who came here and made some kind of intergalactic treaty!
You assholes stole our client! How about some Goddamn business ethics?!
Come on, Nurse Token. We're gonna play football, you puss.
So we've gotta find another way out of here.
It doesn't matter. He'll be most excited to meet me!
What if the residue gets on our hands and it leads to harder drugs like those commercials say.
Heheh, we could make you say whatever we wanted.
Yyeah, except maybe it's not perfectly great, because to some degree, Ike and Ms. Stevenson are having an-.
All right McNuggets!  Did we pick the right rooster or what?!
Okay, there. Now we can carry this egg around in this case without it getting cracked.
Well, look at it this way: statistically speaking, we're safer inside a car with an old person driving than outside.
Dude, we're totally lost! We're gonna die out here!
Yeah. Stan said they're having them over for dinner tonight.
Yes. His flowing melodies are really enjoyable to us.
They knew that staying at Kenny's house would get us sick, and they made us do it anyway.
I am picking up carbon-based life forms in Sector C. I believe we will find a village of peaceful aliens over that ridge. 
Hoh no, dude. If they get sent back to Romania, we'll never get our Cirque dei Ceville going.
I think Stan might've been right. Anyway, I think it's going too far. I mean, if I kill myself, it's gonna make my family really sad.
Hey, wait a minute. Towelie always showed up to give us towel advice when we'd said something about water.
And, and hey, if for some reason Butters can't go to Casa Bonita, you can take his place.
You want a fight? Well, that's fine with me!
Yeah. And then we can try the football field. 
'Cause old ladies are fat and you are, too!
You don't pee in the shower, dude, that's fucking disgusting!
Yeah, they're almost as big as his mom's. 
It's too late for that. Things just can't go back, Stan, uh.  Ah-I'm with Cartman Burger now.
Will you stop it with that?! What part of this is funny to you?!
Hold on, this fight could last more than twelve hours. What if we run out of food?
Yeah, but you know, I learned something today. We thought we could make money on the Internet. But, while the Internet is new and exciting for creative people, it hasn't matured as a distribution mechanism to the extent that one should trade real and immediate opportunities for income for the promise of future online revenue. It will be a few years before digital distribution of media on the Internet can be monetized to the extent that necessitates content producers to forgo their fair value in more traditional media.
No, don't you see? Cartman never had psychic visions. And neither do these people. The plain simple truth is that nobody is psychic. There's a logical explanation for every psychic story you've ever heard.
Dude, have you really listened to the sixth track? I think it's my new favorite.
Yeah, this guy.  Vladimir Stolfsky. He had videos on YouTube of every single rally.
What the hell are you doing telling people that we're a gay couple?!
It's worth a shot. Come on, you guys, we can do this.
Some kids think I'm strange 'cause I like studying for an exam
But I don't let that bother me, because it's who I am. 
No! It's alright! Just give me some time to work on them. I'll see you guys later. 
Just wait till everyone sees my sweet Chewbacca costume. They're gonna be so jealous... 
He's not a douche! He talked to my grandma!
Come on, we have to finish the quest in Stonehaven. 
If you don't show Mohammad, then you've made a distinction what is okay to poke fun at, and what isn't. Either it's all okay, or none of it is.
I don't know.  Oh, great. He's got that stupid beard on again.
No, Ike! Ma, Ike keeps taking off his Squirt uniform!
It's the only way to prove to them that you're real.
On Skippy, on Rainbow, on Patches, on Montel. 
No it's not, Cartman. You know, there really are couples out there who are missing children.
Why? How could you do this? There are people starving in Alabama and... and you give Cartman a million dollars?
Wait a minute! I've got it! The bullriding contest. Cartman could ride a bull, and try to win $5000.  Think about it, dude: $5000. That's 1000 set of balls. That's 3000 balls! We'd have to win enough to get the dolls!
What, you been living under a rock? This is the new meme, Cat Taylor Swift Reporting.
Come on, dude! I can do it! I'm sure!
Kenny's ashes were in an urn, and Cartman drank it, thinking it was chocolate milk mix.
Yeah. Boy, am I glad to see you, Ike.
Yeah, fatass, it has to be real to be scary!
Goddamnit. We're gonna take a short break. Be back in five. 
Don't you remember? That time we were out hunting with your uncle Jimbo and Ned.
That's 15 people we got to agree to come see David Blaine perform in Denver.
Hey yeah, what about poor McNuggets? What's he gonna do now?
Dad? Don't you think our last new house is big enough?
Dude, why'd you make that deal? If we're out buying tampons, we'll miss the trailer anyway/
Dad.  Dad, Ike and I have been talking, and well, we feel that your new car is changing you.
No you're not, dude! You're a guy in a panda costume! 
Come on, Blanket! We gotta go before your dad sees us. 
Hey, Pip. Do you wanna be on my team again?
We have to find Red and Green Mega Man for Cartman's birthday party.
Let me guess: you wrote the joke, and Cartman just laid on the couch eating Twizzlers.
Butters, you have to tell us what Cartman is up to!
But right now I'd say if we're gonna have a retard for a friend, I, I have to pick Timmy. Because Timmy doesn't tell any jokes.
Mom, there might be something that you should look into about Ike staying after school all the time-
Guys, Ike has gotten worse. I'm really worried about him. He says he's still seeing dead celebrities.
Shhh. Willzy-x, don't say anything. We're gonna bust you out of here.
Craig, if Cartman didn't do anything, then he doesn't deserve any of the credit!
Chef, do you know where "shit" comes from?
Because we keep getting screwed over by your diarrhea!
...Yeah, and dressing up and running around at night is faggy anyway.
Yeah, It was seriously the most manly thing that's ever happened.
It just ran by here a second ago. 
Why are you people doing this? Why would you lie like this? To children?
I'll kill you, Triceratops! You made fun of my crippled mother!
Yeah, yeah, that's cool. Bring the left titty out some more.  Yeah, yeah freeze there. 
Don't you get it?! You can't have any Trapper Keepers, fat ass!
Whoa whoa wait a minute!  This isn't what I signed up for! I like Family Guy. Why do we have to get it off the air forever?
Dude! I'm glad to see you. You would not believe the night I had.
Come on, fatass! You shouldn't be eating all that cake anyway!
We want all the country to see that Kenny is alive, and in pain!
You've had that cough a while, Kenny. You okay?
So, what do you want to do now?
Would you stop scaring everyone with your dumb ass myth!
How can I not be nervous? Trying out for the All-State team has been my dream for years.
I guess I didn't realize it was just about the points. 
Not your dad, Cartman! What's your dad got to do with this?!
Some high schoolers left their marijuana cigarette behind. Uh we have to throw it away before some kids find it or something.
E-excuse me, my little brother needs medical attention.
I know. I'm almost at the end and there's nothing. 
No way dude. I'm gonna win the costume contest with this sweet Chewbacca costume.
I know. It's probably gonna be the biggest night of our lives!
When a man and a woman feel ...love... they put their lips together.
All right. Thanks a lot for helping us, dude.
I was the one. I was too afraid to say anything, but I can't let Kenny be sock-bathed for it.
Well, I was just digging around, and I was all like, 'dude, I found this triangle' and my friends were like, 'dude' and I was all like 'dude.'
All right, what do you guys wanna ride first?
That's it.  That's how our parents broke the passcode. I never thought anyone would stoop so low!
I think the other dog's the one that's confused.
But I can't wait to be an adult to be happy. That's forever from now.
No, I mean what happened at the Pentagon?!
Oh Jesus Christ, I had to see it to believe it! What the hell are you doing?!
Alright, alright, let's calm down! I know we're all concerned here!
The water tank?   Hey I'm not going with you!
You threw it away, Cartman! It's mine now.
We found it, you guys!  Oh no, they followed us! 
Wait, what are you taking Stan's blood for?
Oh no, I d- I don't want to be a bother, I uh-
A family! So THAT's why you haven't been able to spread Christmas cheer.
Anyway, that will give me plenty of time playing video games.
Damn! I thought fourth grade was gonna be different.
Well you're NOT crazy. The whale talked to all of us. And he needs our help getting him home.
Wait. No wait a minute! I've got it. I've totally got it!
You know God damned well what's going on! This ends right now! We are a family, and you need to go somewhere else!
Everyone is watching everything.  Ike?  Ike, if you can hear me, I'm sorry. I have been a grandpa.  I didn't understand the things you are into and I and I thought you should like the same stuff that I did.  I have to accept that you're gonna have your own things. I just didn't want you to watch HIM. I just... I just wanna be a family again.
Because we do. It was like this yesterday, and the day before that.
No, no, uh I wanna be tall and black.
But my parents are gonna cut off his ding-dong!
Cartman, do you remember how we all spent the night at Kenny's a couple of days ago?
Yeah. And I think I figured out why.
A-all right, let's split up and look for a passageway. E-everyone take a different direction.  Oh man, we're in big trouble here.
Well, you have to help him, just like I have to help my dad.
Just let us stay up a little longer, mom. Mr. Hankey's gotta show up. He always does.
But why? If they're hungry and poor, why don't we just always give them half of our food?
Yeah he's an idiot but uh I'm sorry, I just... I can't do this anymore, okay? I... I can't do this anymore! 
...You put Kenny's picture on a milk carton??
Would you excuse us for a second?  You just can't expect me to sit there and say nothing. No, Ike, I'm supposed to be looking out for you. So what? I wasn't going to just blurt it out, I was gonna use some tact, but you won't even let me... What? Uh uh! Stop right there, Ike!  Mom, I think maybe you should talk to Ike about love and sex!
Listen, guys, I appreciate you wanting me around, but, the fact of the matter is, well, yeh, you guys are just kind of douche bags.
That fat turd up there is the one who set up you and Token 'cause he thinks blacks belong together! 
Dude, what are we supposed to do? We always just play with fireworks.
'N Sync, Backstreet Boys, New Kids on the Block. All had five members.
Yeah, I like him a lot more than Cartman.
Look, Stan. When Kenny died I learned how important friends are. I'm not gonna lose another friend.
But why are you making such strange laws??
Yeah dude, we made you your own Facebook page. 
Butters! Hey Butters! You have to check this out!
Aw, come on Dad, don't be such a Jew!
I don't want you to jump them, retard!
Yeah, fatass! Get your fat butt on the sled!
Fuck you! Why would they send you in to convince me of anything?!
Ah, I don't know, it just feels like... there's got to be something else going on here.
All right, this is it! If Wall-Mart has a heart, we have to find it and destroy it! No matter what the Wall-Mart does to try to stop us, we have to be strong! Let's do it.
Please, just, just leave it alone, Stan. Everything is as it has to be.
Stan, if I didn't know you better, I would almost think you're doing this because you wanna play with girls.
They're gonna take The Lord of the Rings from us.
No! Maybe we all just need a little image change, you know? Like a makeover.
This must be it. "Cleo Broflovski" That's my grandma. 
No, I just can't get it to load.
Yeah. Hey Stan, what did your dad mean when he said we're gonna play Truth or Dare?
I don't know, but at least from now on, every time we look at the moon, we can know that Willzy-x is up there, dancing with the other zypods in his castle.
Nah, let him make a complete ass out of himself for a little while longer. 
Well, not really, except that Kenny keeps eating people's brains.
Well wait a minute. Don't you see what happened?
I said I'm sorry, you piece of sh- 
Okay. We've got $15 between us. That means we get nine balls to throw.
Dude, my mom won't even let me have a hamster.
Wow. I think I owe you one, Cartman.
We're right here dude. Do you remember now?
Dude, screw this! I don't wanna see anymore!
Cartman, you go ahead and do the commercial tomorrow. But I'm warning you, those anti-smoking people are liars and they're bullies who will stop at nothing to get what they want, and that means they're dangerous. 
Dude, there's a guy with a gun here!
Well, then you should. I think that a person has a right to die if they wanna.
Yeah, this is starting to look like something we shouldn't be any part of. Let's go play with trucks or something. 
Yeah, it was cool, thanks.  Um, so... Is there any way you'd
Yeah, they want everyone to stick around and watch more of this retarded show.
Geez, all that from a stupid video show.
Why do they have to put this on TV?! 
We're gonna make a short animated Christmas card that everyone can watch and play it on the screen at the old drive-in.
Yeah. Look what he did to our friend, Kenny.
Ahh, hi, can we speak to the head guy or something?
You guys, we can't let him do this!
Dude, you don't have to be ashamed or anything.
Don't be sad, Ike. Just be happy that you live in a country where people get to elect a president at all.  Hello?
Ooh, who the hell cares? He's not even my responsibility.
Mom, it was nothing. Mohammad just stood there and then drank some tea.
I'm sorry. I'm. I'm really. Cartman, I f-I feel really bad for you. Honestly.
He just doesn't wanna look like an idiot, so he wants everyone to think the strike was for something. Just, just give him anything!
Yeah.  HEY, WHEN ARE WE GONNA GET TO SOME ACTION, HUH?
Yeah. You aren't having any doubts, are you?
Hey, look!  See Mr. Hankey at the Mall of Nebraska... Wow! We have to go, dude!
Hey, Cartman, do you think God's getting mad at you for not making $10 million? 
Yes. There's a Russian guy named Vladimir Stolfsky who's got search engine hits all over this thing.
Wwait, what do you mean? Stan's in danger?
Thanks for seeing us, sir. My friend is really worried about his dad.
Come on you guys, we need to figure out how to get out of school so we can get my little brother back.
Well at least my mom's not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!
Ike found out last night. My mom's having sex with the UPS man.
Oh. We'll wait for you over there, Steve. We have to start fighting now.
I went online posing as a boy who would have sex with older men, and told them to meet me here. My plan worked perfectly!  Whoa.
Dude! All those choirs are the same. They don't even really sing. They use prerecorded tapes.
What do you mean? We thought she was with you.
We did it! You see, Cartman? You won us the Terrance and Phillip dolls!
You're gonna need to kick more ass than that to beat the Cowboys.
Because you're my little brother, Godddamnit!  And even when I'm fifty and you're forty-five, you're still gonna be my little brother!
How come the visitors aren't coming for him?
You're trying to confuse me now, aren't you?
I'll meet up with you guys in a little bit. I-I wanna hang out here some more.
Cartman, you don't buy pubes, you grow them yourself!
Look, we could we could probably get Terrance, but he'll be performing with this other guy.
Maybe they should project the movies on Cartman's ass. 
Your mom... uses Chipotlaway... to clean blood stains... out of your underwear?
Yeah well, I can't really afford to play anymore anyway. I'm about out of quarters.
We thought you were meeting us at Cartman's. What are you doing here, Taylor Swifting?
Yeah, but now we think maybe heaven isn't a place you can get to, maybe heaven is just an idea. A frame of mind or, or something gay like that. Maybe heaven... is this moment, right now.
I don't know. I feel like I should confront my mom first. But it's so embarrassing.
Goddamnit, don't you get it?! I hate pee! I'm grossed out by pee! The only thing I find more disgusting than pee is bananas!
Hold it.  Pops, I've got the music inside me. It's in my soul. And I know my place is up on that stage. I'm gonna make it to the top. And I just want your blessing, Pops.
Come on, Ike, hurry up!  Where is the next train going?
Stan, you're just jealous of that third grader and you think Wendy's gonna go for him unless you start singing and dancing too.
No. Then I came into this virtual space.
Okay, hang on guys. I'll use my special power to see into the future and find out where we should head next.
Mom, Dad, can I have money to buy Chinpokomon?
But David Blaine is gonna do more miracles in Denver tomorrow..
That's it!  You're not getting high again until we have our Okama GameSphere back!
It's a really dry cold; that's the problem. It- the cold air makes me wheeze.
I'm declaring Shenanigans on you! This game is rigged!
It's hopeless, dude! Butters must have made it to the hospital. By now our parents probably know we were playing with weapons! We have to get rid of the evidence! 
Well... maybe I'll take just half a hit of acid.
What are you talking about, dude?! I fell down that abyss and there it was!
Yeah, he wanted adventure! Not a bunch of ridiculous bullcrap! Right Chef?  Chef?
Ah... Oh Butters,  it'll be all right. Listen, we've all learned that people look for meaning in books. And sometimes, even if it isn't there, they'll try and invent their own meaning.
...And if you look here, you can see how David Blaine performed the miracle of being frozen in ice at Times Square.
I can't wait to watch Terrance & Phillip with Bebe.
You can't do this! We were gonna build an orphanage! So the crack babies have somewhere to go!
Go look! It's all an ancient Incan prophecy.
Why don't you just sneak in your mom's closet and get a picture when she's changing clothes?
I didn't see you complaining at the time, fat boy!
Then why did you send us the goat?
Hey, you know, that nurse is actually pretty cool.
Mr. Garrison, I'm the only one here. Everyone else has chicken herpes.
Oh. Good idea, Phillip. Let's look for treasuh.
You spent $10 and eight hours to unlock a stadium?
Hey, Stan. Do you know how to play Truth or Dare?
This is sweet, being rugged outdoorsmen.  Facing the wilderness, not having to be home until 8:30,... 
Dude, will you just end this thing now?! My little brother is gonna die!
Yeah. You used to sit in the living room with family and friends to hear their commentary on things. Now you can get it with a l-
Yeah. Good job, wizard fat ass! Now we're totally lost.
Let's just stay here and watch the whale swim around some more.
You guys! You guys! I've looked up the word, "shit"! I think it might have something to do with people dying!
Who's everyone?! Who all is in on this?!
Dreidel dreidel dreidel,
I made you out of clay,
Dreidel dreidel dreidel--
It means Jehovah is going to use his powers to keep the Pharaoh from letting us go.
Come on, you guys! We better get to work! 
...Mr. Hankey! Hoh, we were so worried! I was waiting up for you and you didn't come, so I thought that-
Yeah, this life is short. The afterlife is forever.
Yeah. We've been playing with firecrackers our whole lives.
Uh. All I did was show her how to-
It's my seat ring. I have to sit on it because of my hemorrhoid.  Ow.
Don't let him touch you! You die if he touches you!
Does it look like a pig, or an elephant?
It's just that... I really need this A, Stan. And Bebe did say you almost broke your last egg.
We didn't realize hunger made you feel so bad.
God-dammit! Come on, we can go watch it at my house!
Mayor! We have the solution to your problem.
It was him, dude. I told you, it was Mr. Hankey!
Hey, wait a minute. How come Ike's tombstone has the Canadian flag on it?
Well, we just thought we'd let you know. See ya.
Write the number down! Write the number down!!
Alright alright Kenny, calm down. You're too young to be getting BJs anyway. It's good you and Tammy are making a commitment to each other that isn't based on sex.
Even the dumbest lie can have big consequences.
You guys can't tell anybody, all right? Not until I figure out what to do.
The... girls at school. They made a list and voted me the ugliest boy.
Hey McNuggets. You wanna come play for us?
You guys, do you really care what a bunch of girls have to say about how you rank in looks?! 
Cartman, I'm going to tell you something, and I need you to believe me, even if it seems impossible.
Oh, you can pretend all you want! You're not fooling anybody!
No he didn't kill him, he's still breathing!  Get up!  Get UP! 
...I can't even get her to understand. It's like she's from another planet.
Dear Mr. Castro:  I am an eight-year-old American boy who lives in South Park.
But Chef, you just ripped on Chinese people.
Dude, I just found out that everybody pees in pools. Why would I go back?
Then just tell me what Cartman is up to!
Yeah. Then it cancels out the gay polarity.
No, we gotta go. Sally Struthers is gonna give us a ride back to Earth.
You use IntelliLink?? Oh my God! Will you check his records please?
Jesus, man, those Earth Day people don't screw around!
Nobody else is going to help him, you guys. We've got a chance to do something pretty special here. Are you with us?
Well look, if being around lots of cash negatively affects the HIV, then maybe...
What could it be? If only we knew what we were up against.
I mean, I do, but, well, ever since I became friends with that Kip Drordy kid, a bunch of my other friends have started ignoring me. It would be fine except for my farm is starting to shrink. I know that I should just dump Kip as a friend, but that's such a terrible thing to do and, I'm sorry I'm just so confused I... I really need a friend right now.
Ike! You are no longer to watch that stupid little YouTube blogging asshole! Do you understand?! You damn kids following these YouTube commentators is bad enough, but i will not have them invading my living room!
Hey, excuse me, but we need some help.
Hey!  How about you come to school with me tomorrow, so I can at least prove I'm not crazy to my friends.
Oh, you're just saying that because he brings you candy.
I don't think Mr. Jefferson pays enough attention to his son to notice. Come on! 
And so, red hair, light skin, and freckles are all passed down genetically. A child's red hair is not determined by the lack of a soul,  but by the melanins which control the pigment in all of our skins. Thank you. 
Stan, I don't like Wendy.  All I cared about was getting an A in this stupid project!
Well, I mean, all last week you were ripping on ginger kids and now you are one.
No, fatass, I came to get my brother! We all have to get out of here! It isn't safe.
Well, YOU don't, because you're a non-caring asshole, Cartman!
How are you rich?! Your mom pays for everything!
Yeah! Like Stan gives a crap if Wendy breaks up!  Stan? 
You think you own the entertainment business, but you don't! Give us back Wing, RIGHT NOW! 
Yeah. He doesn't even know that the South loses the Civil War.
Tomorrow's trial, Everyone vs. Everyone, is gonna make things a lot worse! We have to stop it!
Well, we'd better get working. Cartman, you go home and call all the pet stores in the phone book.
Oh my God. This is like a third-world country.
We can't get out! The flames are too big!
All right, fine. I'll do the dumb test.
...And see? Here's one from Butters. It says, "We can't wait to see you back in school, Kenny." And it has a picture of him and you in a little airplane! 
I couldn't get in to see the principal, Ike.
Well, that's not really what you say in the commercial.
Come on, Steve, you're going to Des Moines!
Get up, fat boy! I'm gonna kick your ass!
...Alright, that does it!  This has been bothering the hell out of me!  I knew it! You're not Cartman at all!
Wow. Did he say that in the Bible?
Well, it is kinda true, you know? Thanksgiving is fun and all, but the Native Americans got pretty screwed over.
Yeah, I think they already moved in. I saw moving vans in their driveway two days ago.
Because I-  I... Um... because I think... they are real. It's all real. Think about it. Haven't Luke Skywalker and Santa Claus affected your lives more than most real people in this room? I mean, whether Jesus is real or not, he... he's had a bigger impact on the world than any of us have. And the same could be said of Bugs Bunny and, a-and Superman and Harry Potter. They've changed my life, changed the way I act on the Earth. Doesn't that make them kind of "real." They might be imaginary, but, but they're more important than most of us here. And they're all gonna be around long after we're dead. So in a way, those things are more realer than any of us. 
Well I've been thinking: maybe there's something you've come into contact with that hinders HIV from growing. Do you mind if we just look around?
Come on, dude, somebody needs to wipe that fuckin' smirk off his face!
We didn't say nothin' about no kids, man!
Butters, can't you see this is wrong? You've got little boys all over school spending all their lunch money on kisses. Boys shouldn't be paying for kisses. It's wrong.
But of course it matters, because you should be concerned there's blood in your underwear.  Do you understand this?
I got beat up at school... for being different.
Hm, I think he took that pretty well, I think.
God-damnit dude, your mom and dad want you to come home!
I used a bunch of bones from the butcher shop.
Look, can you guys just get down to business so we can go find my little brother?
Craig, we have chosen you to join our Peruvian flute band!
We don't know what you're talking about, lardbutt.
No way, dude! It sucked ass! They don't even have cable!
It says you gotta check it for holes or tears.
I'll never forget you. You were my best friend after Stan.
I don't want to! I don't want anybody telling me how to feel anymore!
Whoa, dude. Your dad is watching Terrance and Phillip.
If you didn't eat so much, you wouldn't have diarrhea all the time, fatass!
Don't worry, Ike. Squirts is fun. And I'll be right over there in the next building. 
All this for a bunch of stupid movies?
L-look, I was just suggesting that maybe this one person could control what he said, but just didn't, for fun.
We're not bailing on the party, we're just think there's... more important things right now!
To City Wok so we can make our money. God!
Mister Father!  We have to ask you something.
Yeah, I don't know what to do with it, though. Well, see ya.
This tape makes people freak out wherever it goes.
Hey Stan, now that Terrance & Phillip has been taken off the air, what are we going to do for entertainment?
Gosh, I hope he doesn't cut me with his celery hand. 
Towelie is a tough choice because,  even though I can see how always having a towel around can come in handy, he's just always so high.
Come on, Stan! Just strike this kid out so we can end the season! 
What did they do with all the fat? There must have been enough to last an Eskimo family months.
It's not Helen Hunt's ass. It's an alien space ship.
Ugh, okay Stan, what do you wanna do?
Okay, here's the one part that really makes no sense to me:  the first time you saw blood stains on your underwear, were you alarmed?
Now we just gotta wait for his urection, and I can give it to my dad.
You guys, maybe we should come clean right now and tell everyone that it wasn't the tobacco companies that made us want to smoke.
That is not what happened! You totally started crying and quit the game!
Dude, Mr. Hankey has magic powers. He can do whatever he wants. 
I'll die if I do swim in it!
Hold tight, buddy. We're gonna find a cure for you. 
Goddamnit, you see what happens when you spread this stupid crap, fatass?
Dad, there is so a tooth fairy, huh?
The whale's name is Willzy-x, and he told us he's dying on our planet. We've come up wth a plan, but we're gonna need all of your help to make it work.
Oh shut up, Cartman! Your Sweet Christmas act isn't fooling anybody!
Yeah. Your fat ass isn't on the sled!
You know what I like best about you? You don't say, "hella," like our Cartman does. I swear, if he says that one more time, I'm gonna kill him! 
Towelie is cool, but he gets stoned all the time. You can't really rely on him for anything.
Yeah. And then Craig's family came on and said Tweek was the wuss, and then punched Tweek's mom in the hooters.
Hello. I'm Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States.
Well, I mean, you didn't just start at 40, didja? You you gotta low-ball these things so you have a place to go.
He didn't do anything. He was always with his new girlfriend.
Are we the only ones here who are completely confused?
He'd be better used as a coat rack. 
Yeah, Jimmy's right. I know we can come up with way better ideas than Craig.
No!  I am NOT letting you go to that television studio and pretend... to care about safety and sensitivity to get a show you don't like off the air!
I don't want to ask Mr. Hat, I'm asking you!
Look! It might be a coincidence, but I think we'd better ask someone. Come on! 
Cartman! I will not stand by and let you cheat your way to winning the Special Olympics!
Hi, we'd like to speak to a  Professor Teabag? 
No, dude, if something happens to him, my parents are gonna blame me.
Cartman, are you still trying to become a lesbian?!
Officer Barbrady, I would like to reinstate my previous Shenanigans! This whole carnival is a rip-off!
Oh please! All you ever do is call me names and rip on me for being Jewish!
All right, all right, I was not responsible for 9/11!  God-damnit!
Not when  if I say he's sick and put him to bed right away.  No, go away! Bad dog!
You mean everyone has been wanting Britney Spears to kill herself?
Yeah. But you know, I've learned something today. You see, the basis of all reasoning is the mind's awareness of itself. What we think, the external objects we perceive, are all like actors that come on and off stage. But our consciousness, the stage itself, is always present to us.
Yeah. And the leader, he said that all the Ethiopians can go live there. 
I knew it! It wasn't because I gave that guy twenty dollars! The homeless all came from here!
Hey. Do you ever think maybe you shouldn't give your son coffee?
Alright guys, do you think he's lying or telling the truth?
This copy of Lord of the Rings made the young Butters behave quite awfully.
It was Cartman having Butters apologize for him.
Wow, you know, Cartman? That is an awesome idea. You should totally go to Somalia.
Dad, will you just listen to me for a second?
It's too late. The treatment would have killed it all.
Well, I finally got my family to use the living room for an hour each night.
Mom, Ike did it again. I don't know what's going on with him, but, it's like he hates me.
Sooo, theoretically, if someone was to step in, it would beee, okayyy?
I didn't "bail," I got picked up by the government!
No! No, I'm not going to Peru! Not Peru! 
That penisbutt didn't lose weight eating sub sandwiches. He lost weight because he ate less of them and exercised.
Yeah. They've kinda killed Kenny -'s look-alike. You bastards!
So get off your fucking scooters and pick them up!
We're trying to raise money for our school chef.
I think Clyde is kind of cool, but Craig is definitely cooler than Clyde.
Oh stop! We're not friends! He's the one who infected me with AIDS!
Wait till you guys see my costume! It's gonna be sweet!
Then we'll wait, because we have to clone Muhammad now!
Ike, I don't care if you wanna grow up, I just wanna be by your side while you do it.
Okay. Okay, you're right.  Oh uh Cartman: thanks.  Cartman?  What the hell? 
I can't keep doing it, Wendy. I know he has an illness, but goddamn, it uh, it's like being around a black hole that just sucks the life out of everything.
Okay. Okay, the shot is finally set up. Now shoot the O mouth for two frames. 
You don't get sucked into it! You don't get sucked in at all! Plehehehehehehehese!
Stan, don't you think this has gone far enough? Is it really that big a deal?  Yeah, just vote. For Giant Douche.
Wow, there's a lot of profiles here. Kyle Broflovski's amazed Stan has so many Facebook friends. Hey, Kyle Broflovski's amazed Isiah is also a Facebook friend of Stan's.
He got a full dose of the stars.
Going to Afghanistan? Locked in a small space for 20 hours? How could things get any worse? 
Not because of the Jews, Butters! Who told you that?
Ohh, right, you're supposed to pull and master-benate your wiener really fast.
You made hamburgers? Well that's awesome! I'd love one.  Mmm. Hm, wow  This is really good, Cartman.
He beat us. Because all this time we've been so caught up with how to protect our music that we forgot to just play.
What? Y-you gotta vote, dude. Haven't you seen the Rock the Vote stuff or, or Puff Daddy's Vote or Die?!
Dude, look, we, we just saw all this stuff on History Channel.
Why's your sister so mean to you dude?
I only got a jar of gefilte fish.
Dammit Cartman! I gave it to you so you would shut... up.
Move on?! Our friend was raped, Stan! He was raped, and we all stood there and did  nothing!
What?! Does everybody have to do it, or just me?
Oh come on! It's obvious what happens! I get killed by Santa Claus so that Christmas is saved!
Well, it looks like she's not going to show up, Stan. Let's go look for the visitors now.
Oh, and what do you know about stem cells?!
It's so unfair! How can my parents do that to me?!
You put a guy's wiener in your mouth, that makes you gay, stupid!
Alright, alright! Knock it off! Stop spreading lies.
Phil Collins Hill on Saturday! You got it!
Okay, so how do we get my little brother back?
'Cause, dombass, scary monsters don't eat big fat smelly bitches!
Because, dumbass, we can dare them to do gross stuff and make them cry! What? Were you born yesterday?
We... came to learn the facts about people with red hair, light skin and freckles.
Cool! We'll see what we can find, ma'am.
Dude, because! You have to stand up for yourself! So will you fight him? 
Yeah. We're gonna call you Fartboy from now on.
Yeah! Then she told us to throw a chair at Ned!
Yeeah, you're welcome. I'm sorry I doubted you. And guys, I'm I'm sorry I acted like a know-it-all. 
Guys, guys, I know we're all concerned, but we have to work together!
You know what? At least Scott Malkinson has some self-respect! At least Scott Malkinson doesn't cave into peer pressure and start doing musicals!
Dude, it's been twelve hours. Where the hell are our parents?!
Looks like we're gonna have to go to Arkansas. Come on, guys. We're gonna put a stop to Wall-Mart once and for all!
Chr, what could you possibly have in your room that could change the outcome of the election? 
Yeah. Let's just have a slumber party here.
This isn't paradise and you know it! The people here are starving and dying! The whole world has used Somalia as a dumping ground for toxic waste. Even the fish here are radioactive!  Cartman, just give me my brother  and let us get out of here!
Oh yeah.  Fine, I'll kick your ass tomorrow, dick! 
See Cartman, your mom is on the cover.
If they give you something small, will you end the strike?
This is it. This one's for the game.
You know, I heard our fourth-grade teacher is some new lady from Denver.
Okay.  N-no, ah I don't want that much responsibility. Here, you hold on to it, Kenny. 
Hey Cartman.  I care a lot about him, too. 
I left my wife today. Walked out of the apartment without saying a word. I ran away from my responsibilities... just like I always do.  And I, again, am alone. 
Now look, Butters, when the girls bring out the future-telling device, pay attention to how it works. Once you know how to operate it, just grab it and get the hell out of there.
Cartman, you dumbass! You can't get a new one!
They just released part 3 in theaters and it made 80 million opening weekend.
Hey, you scrawny-eyed shithead, what the fuck is wrong with you?! You must be some kind of fucking asshole to be able to ignore a crying child!
That's not what I meant by doing something about it, Cartman!
All right, it's decided. Let's all write in "Giant Douche."
Ya see Ike? There's nothing. There's nothing for you to be afraid of.
Well, but, this is the jacket I always wear.
"Dear Mommy and Daddy: I am running away. I am sorry, but I can no longer handle the monotony of middle-class life. Everyone at school is a fucking idiot, and if one more person talked to me about that Susan Boyle performance of Les Misérables I was going to puke my balls out through my mouth. I love you all, but I have to move on. I'm going to Somalia to be a-" to be a pirate?! Oh shit!
Hey, we'd do anything for our bros, man.
Wait. Stan?  Hold on, is this my virtual reality, or Cartman's virtual reality?
This is not Mr. Hankey!  This is a fake! 
You're okay with everything you think going up on the Internet?
Nono, you're right. Somalia is an oasis of treasure and waterfalls. It's totally the pirate's life.
Cartman, you are hereby declared a full-fledged retard!
Don't you think you owe everyone an apology for bringing NAMBLA here?
Look man, w-we know what you learned was pretty tough to hear.
Why are they doing us one at a time?
Hey dude, ah are you the guys messing with Cartman's stuffed animals?
Yeah. They're tryin' to scare everybody 'cause they're gay wads.
Now, that's what I call a sticky situation. 
I don't know how you do it, dude. How do you get up in front of that many people?
I didn't wanna have to do this.  but if you don't tell us, I'm gonna tell your dad you helped get the wrong person elected President!
Yeah! Next time you make up a word, don't make up one that already exists!
Only sixteen dollars? They can't be cool if they're only sixteen dollars. 
Yeah, well people should  know that peeing in pools is  bad!
Well, that didn't work. What else can we try?
No more. No more. Oh, come on, Cartman, no. No more. 
Dude, what actually makes total sense about it, if you look at it, is that the crack babies are finally getting some attention and the care that they need.  Yeah. It's pretty cool, dude. Because most of these babies would normally not even get out, you know? Huh, or be able to do anything.  Just because we are making money doesn't mean that those babies aren't benefiting. It isn't exploiting them. They're finding a useful place in society. What's so unethical about that? 
How do you know...  that wasn't your therapy? 
Oh my God, what if I'm not real?
Well, c-cause dude, I'm Jewish, a-and you know...
Wait a minute. I though your father was your mother 'cause she had a penis.
Cartman released the PS4s Cartman. They're being reviewed. People are liking them.
Chop off his wee wee?! Are you sure?!
It's not new!! I'm gonna look "shit" up in the encyclopedia and prove it!!
Our parents won't let us have weapons, dude. 
Throw 'em away!  Dudes, here he comes. Guys, stop coughing. 
Yeah, now what are we supposed to do?
Stan...  Do you really think my hat is stupid?
This isn't a joke, Cartman! You have to believe me, officer. The outcome of the election depends on it.
That kid and I had a long talk! I told him he was on a slippery slope to becoming a monster like you!
Dude, no wonder terrorists come from places like this! If I grew up here, I'd be pissed off, too!
Yeah. And now you can take that stupid beard off! 
We know. Believe me, we know. We're reminded every day that you're not Kenny because Kenny... was cool.
Cartman! We've been brainwashed, don't you see? We don't have to do this!
It was just thirty minutes of two women queefing on people!
Okay. So we put little "woo" mouths on all our heads.  And then we shoot that for one frame.
But it's like eight pages long and they send me a new one like every three weeks! How can they know if I-
Phil Collins is playing Lalapalala's, and because we're all doing so well in school now, our parents said they would take us.
Hey, wait a minute.  Is it possible that...
We d-didn't think it was that big a deal.
Oh well, at least as president you can run the school the way you want.
Maybe they took it literally when we said we wanted to adopt a kid.  Whoa! That was cool.
Dude, what are you talkin' about? That was awesome!
I don't know. Last night we found him hiding in the kitchen pantry. He was screaming the name "Billy Mays" over and over again.
That's nothing compared to what my mom will do to me if she finds out I've been lying for five years!
See? Look at this. Ike has all his friends over and they're just sitting around on their own computers barely talking to each other. Ike is watching PewDiePie play Dragon Age.
No, we don't want to enter any of your stupid shelter!
Look, we already have the guy's blog. Maybe we can find an address and check it out on MapQuest.
'K, so then get on Facebook and fertilize my crops?
But we've been playing for eight hours. We can't think of anything else to do.
Stan, this has gone too far. People are going to get hurt. What you started is way out of control.
Hi. My name's Kyle. Uh, I understand that your country flies people into space for money.
Do you think they're gonna pissed at us for lying that they molested us and sending them all to jail for ten days?
I'm gonna make a new costume during recess. I can still win that candy.
Oh no. Nohoho no. Cartman, don;t you do this! The Middle East is finally at peace!
I don't know what to do.  Part of me feels like I wanna end it all now.  Tell people what heppened. You know, I never knew how beautiful this pond was before.  So cold. The world can feel like that.  So calm on the outside, as if nothing bad ever happens.  Ow.  What the hell are you doing, Cartman?!
Okay. Here we go.  Hey! That was right on target.
But, everyone thinks I was responsible for 9/11.
Be a good boy? You know all about this?
Dude, you can't miss Halloween! You have your iPad?
I can see clearly now, the rain is goneI can see all obstacles in my way-
Because I saw you. Okay? In your room, passed out, with a VR headset on. Customer Service said that one of us needed to put on the headset and come get you, and that's why I'm here.
Uh, hi. Our friend joined your club a while back, and now he wants to molest kids. 
Whoa, Cartman. We aren't gonna be hippies anymore. Y-you don't have to kill us.
Dude, they don't care we knocked Butters' eye out with weapons?
Cartman, Cartman! I heard that Stan somehow found out about our plan!
I am Tooth Decay. Your teeth shall be mine. With candy and treats I will take-
You aren't gonna get away with this you stupid asshole! 
Aw, don't be such a baby!  You do it, Kenny.
Dude, did you see that stuff Phil Collins was saying about Timmy?
Here's our cell phone, dude.  Will you call the police for us? 
You mean to tell me that all this time I've been trying to protect Ike from having his fireman cut off, and he's not even my real brother?!
Jambu! Jambu, I'm back!  How are you feeling?  Huhm. Jambu, you wanna talk about rocket ships?  Ja- Jambu? Are you still feelin' lonely here?
This was supposed to be my story! My coming to terms with a guilty conscience! This isn't fair!
You got Randy Newman to do the theme song. You're not trying that hard. Token, you're a good kid. How can you sit there and collect money on a show that's about a, about a fat child killing himself?? Where's your sense of shame??
Yeah. My school teacher wanted to be a woman, and you made him into one.
This whole time your TV is in a house with nobody in it?!
Get back on, fatass! You have to practice!
Here's the control panel that operates all the stars.
He is under alien control. That thing in his butt is linked up to the visitors!
You see, we've learned something today. Swearing can be fun, but doing it all the time causes a lot of problems.
How? How could the Jews do that to Jesus?
We can eat it at Cartman's house, and see more naughty pictures of his mom.
Mr. Garrison, didn't the guy who shot John Lennon say it was because of this book?
All right, but it's gonna take more than one good player to beat the champions, Stan. You'd better have a really good game plan.
So, do you uh, do you have any brothers or sisters, Natalie?
You are not going to go on national television and spew a bunch of hate speech about Jewish people! I won't let you do it, Cartman!
That isn't my idea! I saw a bus in a garage a couple of blocks back! We need to modify it!
The past...four nights we've tried to play, he shows up and kills us!
Eminem, Justin Timberlake, Hootie... They all have agents. You need somebody to manage it all for you.
Yeah. And my powerful nunchakus make me into Bunroku , a deadly but compassionate ninja who protects those in trouble.
Dude, I don't think we should be messing around with that crap anymore.
Yeah. How are we supposed to know that pan flute bands would be outlawed?
Hey, uh- we were all just talkin' about how when you get better, we're all gonna go down to Stark's Pond again and go camping. Huh, Stan?
I don't know. But there's gonna be lots of food, and a band.
No, I mean, this is impossible, Stan! Cartman is the biggest asshole in the world! How is it that God gives him a million dollars?
Butters, people can't just go around beating up people who have diabetes! Now whatever your problem is, you just-
Yeah, but it's okay Butters. They have purity rings now.
Dude. I don't know if I'm going to like the new Eric Cartman.
But where have you been? Things aren't the same without you. Nobody seems to have the Christmas spirit.
It's not cool! Ike isn't old enough to understand.
Ike, Ike, you have to be honest. Am I ugly, yes or no?  You ALL think I'm ugly. Jesus Christ, the least you could have done is told me!
There. Do you really want that asshole to win?
(I need some help! I can't take it!)
Yeah, what's this about? We should be writing our monologues for Smackdown.
I think we should bail. If we leave the group, maybe other people will get the courage to leave, too.
That's a retarded idea that won't work. Why are you really doing this?
Yeah, but dude, he seriously could have died in that fire.
It's just sending images of cities and people and stuff.
I know. But just like you, I feel like I have to try. People can really get hurt, and a joke just isn't worth that.
Dude, I can't deal with Wall-Mart right now. My parents had me there for three hours last night. 
Yeah, you're cool. And you don't say "hella."
Dude, it's got a hundred twenty eight gigahertz D-RAM.
You guys don't understand! His wacko teacher is like a schoolgirl! They pass notes to each other in the classroom, they have sex at her house over lunch break,  and during class they sneak out and kiss in the hallways! 
I don't know. Ever since he was in that movie, he got all famous.
If some of us are on PS4s, but the rest of us are on XBox's, then we all can't play together online. See? This is all about committing to one machine.
Sweet. I made mine go off the jump. 
We can't wait here any longer! Dude, we've gotta get him out of here or he's gonna die.
Alright, alright, let's get this over with so we can put her back!
We're already doing a paper on Tweek's underpants gnomes.
Heck yeah I'll visit your farm! You should check mine out too!
Ahh-d, excuse me, sir, did I hear you say you needed somebody for your show?
He's a magician named David Blaine, dude. He kicks ass.
It's not stupid, Stan. For once in my life I feel like I'm part of something.
Oh, we're just makin' a cradle out of an egg carton for our egg. We figure that way it'll be easier to keep safe so we can get an A.
No, we really want nothing more to do with these people.
What would we use a marble sack for?
Are you gonna take us somewhere or not?!
There's no choice anymore, guys. Don't worry about me. I've been preparing for this for a while now. 
Shut up about Jews, fatass! You don't know anything!
Yeah, it's tough. But it's times like these that... you see what your band is made of. We've gotta fight through the rough times like Journey!
So how was that movie last night, dude?
You know why! Because we're trying to keep our parents from watching murder porn!
How many tickets can we put you down for?
Hold it!  Principal Victoria, Mr. Mackey, Mrs. Streible. We have something we need to tell you.
Hello? Will you just give this guy something, please?!
But, but we, we learned things, and took up a cause.
When I say "go," you slam your electric wheelchair into high gear. Okay, Timmy?
All right. Come on you guys, we have to get back home. 
We can't, dude. Not until we find Mr. Hankey. 
I just think I'd rather... control it instead of blame it on anything.
I hate you, remember?  You wanna be partners, Jimmy?
So I guess this means we get to keep our weapons.
So, you guys are totally broken up then? It's... done?
Aaaarrghhhhhh!  I'm not one of them! Do you understand me?! You'd better get that through your fat head! I will never be one of them, and if you say it again, I swear to God, I'll smash your fucking teeth in! 
Well, you guys can do what you want! I'm going down to that church to confess my sins and eat crackers! And I'm taking Ike with me! 
Wendy, I just wanna get an A, okay? Let's not make this any more confusing than it already is. &lt;&gt;
Don't get scared up in the mountains Cartman.
So wait, wait: Stan took a dump in the urinal and he contacted the conspiracy Web site? But the conspiracy site was run by the government?
Aww. Well Cartman, you can change things about yourself.
So, dude, do you have any brothers or sisters?
Okay, I fed the pigs. Now I definitely should water some fields... Oh wow, cool. That Jewish kid put up a sign on my farm. "Hey Kyle, really like your farm." Oh awesome!  What the hell is that? Stan? 
It's so awesome, dude. Our company already has a hundred backers. And we still have 14 days to go!
Hey! We should buy Ms. Ellen Valentine's Day presents. 
Gone are the dark clouds that had me-
All I'm saying is that it's gonna take a lot of singing to make up for that!
If you knew something, but, you couldn't tell anyone, what... what would you do?
God-dammit. Come on, guys. We gotta go to Butters' house.
No, but look: I just got this sweet Cyborg Bill doll.
Oh shut up Cartman! You don't even know what you're talking about!
Dude, we have to get to the mall!!
Dad, can we go home? All you ever do since you got this car is drive around and show it off! 
Dude, where are we going to find a pumpkin to carve?
Look, just go ahead and play, alright?  Leave me alone.  Can I get a Fresca, please?
All I wanted was to play one level of Call of Duty and you know what Ike told me? He said the living room was for old people.
But... they were here. Ah I swear it. Stacks and stacks of ballots from states all over the country!
We can't miss the final apocalyptic battle between Good and Evil!
Hi, uh- our friend has been brainwashed by some fruity little club.
And it actually helps the crack babies. It's like volunteering but, but we just make a little on the side.
Nah. Dude, I c-I can't go to have a birthday party while Butters is missing.
They're cells that come from fetuses, and some research show that they could be used to treat diseases.
Then why the hell do they call it "veal"??
Please, Chef, if I don't get out of school and get my little brother back from the aliens, my parents are gonna disown me.
Well, why did you pull it out of the trash?
I'm just trying to fit in, Daddy. Don't be such a drama queen! 
You can raise $2 million, dude. We'll help you.
Where is Butters? We were supposed to leave here forty minutes ago.
Ot- Nice to meet you, Cartman. Yuh you know, I saw that same jacket you're wearing at Bosco's for $29.95. How much was yours? Um, I juh- I was just wondering if Bosco's is a ripoff?
I have to show you something.  I think it will change the way you feel about your impact here.
Or if you sold one to an "Eric Cartman"?
Who took all the pizza and the cake?  What the hell?
I didn't come to stop you. I... I think you're right, Cartman. I want to help you get the Family Guy episode pulled.
Dude, I don't think Kenny's coming back. My dad said those Child Protective Services people are pretty serious.
Can I have three thousand dollars, Mom and Dad, huh?? Can I??
I'm sorry you guys, but there is something we can do. We can go to Canada and see the Prime Minister like I said. If we can change his mind before Christmas, then your parents won't have to give my family money.
And so they put us in these harnesses and helmets. I th-I think that's when we started realizing, "Oh wow, this is actually pretty dangerous."
You can't just roll into places and take people's lives away!
He's just... changing a lot. He walks around angry, telling me I'm stupid and, and all he talks about is sex.
Oh, you are so full of crap, Cartman! Metal spikes will not come out!
I can't. I have to wait for Rebecca to show up.
Did you make it to your job interview?
Nono Dad, please. I just got Call Of Duty: Advanced Warfare. Me and Ike are going to play it together.
Oh, shut up, Cartman. All you did was jump over one homeless guy.
Me?? Dude, I've been here since the beginning!
But... we were so close... I'm sorry, Willzy-x. We tried.
I don't wanna know when I'm going to die, fatass! 
You were scared Cartman! you almost peed in your pants!
Well, you're not gonna last down here either, Mr. Hankey. Now, come on! I'm not gonna let you die!
Oh my God, you're right! You're totally right!! EVERYONE! GET A NEW TREND GOING! FAST! #webelieveinyou!
Um I think we're just heading deeper into the mountains.
You know, I didn't even get home until 2:30.
Ah, look, Phillip. Everyone in South Park just wants to see your serious side.
But it's our game. We bought it together.
I dunno. I just have this sudden urge to go back.
Ookie mouth!  Gross! I can't do it, Ma!
We couldn't get trapped here forever, Cartman. We'd die after a couple of days. 
Hey. They've never been allowed to walk before. They just don't know how.
Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?! They're identical!
I hate picture day at school! It's always some gay-ass photographer with some gay-ass backdrop of New England!
They on'tday?!  Why the ellhay otnay?! It ooktay ourfay ourshay to akebay this Od-damnedgay akecay, and ownay we're otallytay ewedscray!
Why the hell don't people tell me these things?!
Rebecca, don't you ever... look at the town? At that...  flicker of light over there?
No, I'm serious. What is that behind you?
Oh n-no, I'm not really friends with him.
Um... so...  So dual citizenship, wow, uh... You know that I, I never knew anyone that had that.
I'm sure that would scare the hell out of him, Cartman.
You guys, who cares if the girls make some stupid list? Girls make dumb lists all the time.
Do you really think that this is good for Butters? To have his face put up all over signs as the poster child for bullying?
You've gotta try and stay on for ten seconds. Okay, Cartman?
Dude, this book says I don't exist unless I think I do. But what if I don't?
Yeah, all you have to do is fart some more, Cartman! And the visitors are sure to come!
We need him to win a bullriding contest so we can get Terrance and Phillip dolls. Can he still do it?
Let's all try to help a little, 'cause 
Well, our pig hasn't given birth yet, but she should anytime now.
Mr. Jefferson said we can invite all the kids in town to go play over at their house.
I don't know, I-I just thought if we all drank the Mountain Dew, the caffeine and the sugar would help us stay awake. I told Cartman he has to share it.
Oh. Well, I certainly don't want you to feel that "Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly on the Table" is holding you back. 
Wow, look at all these people playing right now.
Is it like a- haunted house or something?
I went up to Jambu's tank and I tapped three times like the trainer did. Jambu swam up and started talking to me about rocket ships! Come on! You gotta check it out! 
Ike!  Stop the bus! Miss Crabtree, you have to stop this bus!
We're not kids. We're full-grown men with dwarfism! How dare you assume that all midgets are children! We demand an apology!
Well, because, we don't really... believe in Jesus.
They kind of look like us.  I mean, Stan's got blue eyes and I've got a sharper nose, but I mean, they kinda look like us.
I've tried talking to him, but he doesn't want the lawsuits to stop. He's making too much money.
Aw, stop it, Cartman! Your hand hand doesn't need to breathe!
Cartman got his, then Kenny. What if tomorrow Stan says he got his and I'm left out? I might not even get to be their friend anymore.
Well, I just found out I'm a sex addict. I'm so scared, I haven't even told my mom yet.
But he's just using his time on television to rant about-
Dude, if these guys are as bad as you say, then we have to do something!
...a-are starting to take offense at your actions. We feel like you're starting to become-hmm... 
And then takes you to Chipotle, and buys you more?
Well, I guess let's just be thankful we're not Butters. They won't even let him come back to school.
It's not a game, you derelict! And this isn't Scotch! It's apple juice! 
We really think this is gonna work, Stan. All we have to do is convince your dad that his cooking sucks, right?
Alright, so did everyone settle on their wrestling names?
Ah man! I can't keep my eyes open. 
Fatass Cartman was
not on the school bus today.
What a big, fat turd.
I don't know. I think... we've been given another chance.
Well that does it! If us boys are going to live, we have to get rid of the girls!
This is it, Stan. If you strike this kid out, we all get to go home.
Look, Stan, I'm finally whole! My dad is even gonna take me back down to the all-star game to see if I can try out for the team again!
Wull yeah, but ah-I got my brother back.
You yourself led the campaign against the colorization of films. You understand why films shouldn't be changed.
Those things are stupid, Cartman. They just stick your hand in cold spaghetti and tell you it's intestines and stuff.
Yeah, and he was out sick yesterday too. Guys...  I think Kenny isn't here because he's at home cheesing.
And do I have to shovel the whole driveway, or just the side the car is on?
Dude, we have to do whatever we can to get that feeding tube put back in!
Cartman was right! The holiday season is for idiots!
But Dad, this is all the never-before-seen footage.
Well, she's not here! That's just great! Thanks a lot, Stan! You're gonna get me busted again!
With genetic engineering, can you make an elephant smaller?
Okay, okay, you can have your powers back.
Wow! I guess Cartman really did take care of them.
Come down here, you stinking aliens!  Uh, uh...
Mr. Garrison, we've been watching Barnaby Jones repeats for eight days now. It's hard to keep paying attention.
I'm still not inviting you to Casa Bonita.
Dude! I aced that test! I'm gonna win that dinner with Ms. Ellen!
No. I cross-referenced his YouTube profile with MySpace, and according to his blog, he's an old-school Communist. So what's he doing at every Clinton rally?
If you want to make sure I'm not switching sides, Cartman, you don't have to worry. Stan is wrong.
Yeah. It's almost as big as Cartman's ass.
Stan, you can't let that Tad guy get to you. Screw him, dude.
Dude, you're just jealous because I'm Chinpoko Master!
Get the hell off me! You're a freak, Butters! You can't play with us!
Hello?  Excuse me. I'm here to pick up Ike?  Uh, hello? Is Ike here?  Hello? 
Are you guys having a meeting or something?
I can't. My dad grounded me. Wait a minute, where is my dad?
Hey, where's the school bus? We're gonna be late for football practice. 
Are you serious?? Look around: doesn't this bother you at all??  That's YOU one day, fatass! Not even one day! If you don't change something, that's you! In about a year! 
The only thing of yours that's larger in size is your big fat ass!
Aagh! For Christ's sake, Cartman, when was the last time you changed your socks?
This is Cartman. I have to take it.  Hello?
You're right, Stan. My Grandma isn't floating around, judging me and watching what I do. She's dead. Dead and gone forever.
Eric, sources are speculating that third-grade student, Pete Thelman , pees sitting down like a girl. We've also got confirmation that Sally Turner  stuffs her bra. And Clyde Donovan has only one testicle.
That's not what she said. You're putting extras on again. It's not that funny.
What the hell is that?  Oh my God. 
Yeah. I guess that's the point. I don't think we're gonna understand. Maybe this IS all the beginning of a new art form. YouTube celebrities are only getting bigger. And what's great is that these people are inventing themselves, instead of being marketed and shoved down our throats.
Elder, It's not my fault. He told me he was Jewish.
Well, thanks for everything, you guys. You really helped us see how important parents are.
Ha! Our bet was that you would get a platinum album, not a myrrh album! I don't owe you anything, fat boy!
Well what the hell are we gonna do? Dress him up in a princess gown and, and parade him around like the parents on those awful child pageants? 
We said we wouldn't be a part of this fad and look at you!
Hoh!  Anyways, you put a spin on it by holding it here and-
Aw, they wanna fight! They just don't know it yet! 
I need you to keep quiet about this, all right?  My little brother and his tea-
Dude, don't kill your mom. That's not cool.
You found Cartman like this and you think he's somehow trapped in virtual reality?
Well you should. The poor guy shouldn't be screamed for something that just isn't that big a deal at all. 
But dude, check out my new Trapper Keeper.  It has five different compartments for each subject in school,  and it's all covered with pictures from Dawson's Creek.
Don't be stupid, Cartman. Our teacher wouldn't be out lying in the forest waiting to kill us!
Pleahehese! My farm hasn't expanded in three days!
I got a job, Stan. I am making tons of money doing some really cool stuff.
Our band can't find a stylistic direction to go in. We need to go down to the mall to buy hundreds of CDs to listen to so we can define our sound.
How the hell did they find out it was us that TP'ed that house?
