Hope for a... chance at tomorrow? 

Yes! Because maybe we rolled the dice too many times!

Sorry, babe, but my heart is forever stenciled in permanent ink with the name  Kelly.

If we find anything, we'll try to send help for the rest of you.  Let's go.  Come on if you're comin' Mister Vice President! 

Kehhhllihhhh! No! Noooo! 

If we have made too much of an impact, then that consciousness would try to snuff us out! I think we're looking at a global catastrophe, the likes of which we've never seen!

Not a chance.

I don't think so! 

Hope. Hope, you're alive.  My God...  Heh?!

Oh my God.  We have to get out of here!

Mr. President! Mr. President! I believe we have a serious problem!  The environment... is changing. I believe it is somehow, reacting to our presence on it.

Our ancestors came here from another world. Maybe there's still other worlds out there with life forms like us. Maybe there's even a world where they've learned to live with the planet instead of just on it.

You have to! For the babih! 

You can all stay here; I'm gonna try to save my babih. 

What the hell do you want, Vice President?!

It's real. Real as my love for my unborn babih.

We aren't out of this yet! You two look for other survivors. You get whatever food you can and bring it back here. 

Then go ahead and die there, I'm leavin' with my babih!

Don't you get it? The world doesn't want you here! It's not gonna stop until you're dead!

Luck had nothin' to do with it. 

We have to get out of here now, Kellih! 

First we have to get out of the forest, into the forbidden zone. It's the only way we might even see another planet!

You son of a bitch! You had a chance to stop this! So help me, if we live through this, I'm gonna see you rot in prison!

What are you going to do?

Everyone get up into the trees! We have to get up high! Come on, Kelly! 

Don't look, Kelly! Don't look!

Look, this is the world, right? But now, think of the world as... a living being.  If it were somehow conscious, then it would ultimately become aware of our effect on it.

How many survivors?

Kellih. Kellih, can you hear mih? I don't know if you can. But... I wanted you to know I tried. I tried to save our babih. But I let you down, babe.  Keh... k-Kellih? 

We'll die here! Look, the world is getting rid of us! Don't you get it?!

Kellih! Hang on!

Kelly, I was just thinkin' about our babih. I want to name her... Hope.

Sometimes... I just worry what kind of world our babih is gonna grow up in.  I need to run up to the forest and do another sediment analysis. I'm worried we might be overworking the tertiary layer. 

Why you murdering bastard!

God did! When he killed my wife! 

Damn you! Why?!
