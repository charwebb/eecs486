We'll die here! Look, the world is getting rid of us! Don't you get it?!

Heh. We made it, Hope. We made it, Kellih! 

If we have made too much of an impact, then that consciousness would try to snuff us out! I think we're looking at a global catastrophe, the likes of which we've never seen!

Hope. Hope, you're alive.  My God...  Heh?!

What are you going to do?

You son of a bitch! You had a chance to stop this! So help me, if we live through this, I'm gonna see you rot in prison!

It's real. Real as my love for my unborn babih.

Kehhhllihhhh! No! Noooo! 

Damn you Vice President Craig! You could be killin' us all!

If we find anything, we'll try to send help for the rest of you.  Let's go.  Come on if you're comin' Mister Vice President! 

Damn you! Why?!

Mr. President! Mr. President! I believe we have a serious problem!  The environment... is changing. I believe it is somehow, reacting to our presence on it.

Why you murdering bastard!

You can all stay here; I'm gonna try to save my babih. 

This isn't going to stop. The world is rejecting us! If we're gonna live, we have to get off this planet.

Then go ahead and die there, I'm leavin' with my babih!

I don't think so! 

Our ancestors came here from another world. Maybe there's still other worlds out there with life forms like us. Maybe there's even a world where they've learned to live with the planet instead of just on it.

Kellih. Kellih, can you hear mih? I don't know if you can. But... I wanted you to know I tried. I tried to save our babih. But I let you down, babe.  Keh... k-Kellih? 

Luck had nothin' to do with it. 

Oh my God.  We have to get out of here!

Sorry, babe, but my heart is forever stenciled in permanent ink with the name  Kelly.

God did! When he killed my wife! 

You have to! For the babih! 

First we have to get out of the forest, into the forbidden zone. It's the only way we might even see another planet!

Kelly, I was just thinkin' about our babih. I want to name her... Hope.

Hope for a... chance at tomorrow? 

How many survivors?

Everyone get up into the trees! We have to get up high! Come on, Kelly! 

Not a chance.

Don't look, Kelly! Don't look!

Kellih! Hang on!

Look, this is the world, right? But now, think of the world as... a living being.  If it were somehow conscious, then it would ultimately become aware of our effect on it.

Don't you get it? The world doesn't want you here! It's not gonna stop until you're dead!

We have to get out of here now, Kellih! 

We aren't out of this yet! You two look for other survivors. You get whatever food you can and bring it back here.
