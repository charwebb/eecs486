Meant to ask you, can you think you can get someone to drive me around because of the, uh, DUI situation?
Halpert, you lookin' for someone to bang your wife?
I am going through a twelve-step program. I'm currently on step zero. Which is have a [expletive] of fun. I spent six hours carefully removing the frosting and then layering in a variety of drugs, some legal, some not. Some laxative, some constipating. You don't fire the Pac-Man and expect to get away with it.
[sounds sick on the phone] I can't make it.
[to Nellie] Are you kidding? [to Robert] She's the queen of the whole freaking Magilla!
I said it. And then, suddenly, for no reason, this bimbo blows the whistle on the whole thing just to be a bitch.
No? Wow. I'm in this mode now where I'm apologizing for thoughts that are in my head. [Clark fake laughs] Hey. I have a crazy feeling [hands Clark a cupcake] that you are really gonna like this.
Actually, they have a specific way I need to do this. And, I have to go through examples of stuff.  OK. Uh, where to begin. [to Pam] Hey. Pam-pam and her pam-pams. Wow. I have said some crude things about those. But, they are beautiful. And, I guess that's why I acted out. Pam, I'm sorry I objectified you. And, personified your breasts. Sorry, guys. [to Phyllis] Oh boy. I have not been nice to you. Philly, I'm sorry for the things I said about your size. To your face, behind your back, and in the form of drawings. Actually, that goes to all you double XLs. Stanley, Kevin, [points to Clark] this kid in a few years.
Why does everyone ask me that? Who the hell is that?
Oh here's what you do. Hike up your skirt and pull out your tampon, borrow some balls and come meet me!
Nice. [To Jim] Hey, Halpert, anyone ever tell you you look like Wooly Willy?
Oh my. They really got to you, didn't they?
Dude, I've been here since three! I've boot and rallied twice.
OK. Let's get right to it. I guess. My name is Todd Packer and I am in recovery. I'm working the steps. I'm on step eight of Alcoholics Anonymous and step nine of Narcotics Anonymous. I'm here to make amends. I've been hard to deal with over the past years. Kind of a jerk. I know it. I don't need you to accept my apology, but I'd love it if you did.
Why can't I just be nice? Truth is, I really like you guys. I really do. OK. The apology���s just half of it. The big thing is making amends. And, that's why I brought these. I went out to the Steamtown Mall and I got you all cupcakes. From that place 'Nipples'.
Hey, Moonface. Nice to see those shiny, little Chinese eyes of yours.
[high-pitched voice] I saw you on the news and I want to pinch your tiny wiener...  [normal voice] It's Packer!
Schrute���s out to get me. But I���m playing the long game. As soon as he messes up, I swoop in like a sexual predator.
Hello, yes. I'm looking for a gay nerd named Michael Scott.
Oh. I'm Todd. Oh, sorry for calling you a fat, little runt earlier.
Hey, uh, I just wanted to say I'm sorry for screwing you.
That's... that's the same guy. It's the joke I made.
What has two thumbs and likes to bone your Mom? [points at self] This guy!
Huh. The mind sees what it wants to, huh? [hands cupcake to Erin] There you go.
I've been meaning to ask her one question. Does the carpet match the drapes?
Well, looks like Shnoot's a no-show. Guess he wasn't vice presy material after all. But I am. Put me in, babe. I got the info down backwards, forwards, and doggy-style. I'm your man.
[on the phone] Is this Michael Scott? My secret lover. My intercom, I told you never to call me here. Never! [Michael's laughing]
Where is Michael Snot? Sniffing some dude's thong? Probably.
There's this guy. He's at a Nymphomaniac Convention. And he is psyched 'cause all these women are smokin' hot perfect 10's, except for this one chick who looks a lot like, uh... [points at Phyllis]
[on the phone] I want my money back you greedy Hebrew. Bergerstein!
Are you kidding? Everyone knows why! You don't know? Okay, check this out. Al lright. So here's the story. So Randall is nailing his secretary, right? And she is totally incompetent.
[rapping] What's up my nerds. Check it out. [points at the mistletoe stuck down his pants]
[grabbing Michael around the neck] Merry Christmas, asswipe!
So, that's it. I just wanted to make amends. [slides cupcakes across table to Darryl and Jim]
Hey, you know what? It was, uh, great to see you all again. Take care. [exits]
Don't ever let this little bitch drive you around town. We got, uh, lost for half an hour.
Fat and ugly. You might actually have a chance.
I don���t see what that gets us, but I���m a team player.
If I may speak to that, I have only been vice president of this project for the last half hour, so the man you want is Dwight Shrute.
What, you, I, I can't get fired. I'm an institution. I have been at this company for 20 years. How many of you have been here that long, huh? [Dwight exits meeting room and helps Jim up]
