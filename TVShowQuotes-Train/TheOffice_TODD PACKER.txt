[on the phone] I want my money back you greedy Hebrew. Bergerstein!
I said it. And then, suddenly, for no reason, this bimbo blows the whistle on the whole thing just to be a bitch.
Halpert, you lookin' for someone to bang your wife?
What, you, I, I can't get fired. I'm an institution. I have been at this company for 20 years. How many of you have been here that long, huh? [Dwight exits meeting room and helps Jim up]
If I may speak to that, I have only been vice president of this project for the last half hour, so the man you want is Dwight Shrute.
Well, looks like Shnoot's a no-show. Guess he wasn't vice presy material after all. But I am. Put me in, babe. I got the info down backwards, forwards, and doggy-style. I'm your man.
Maybe next 'queer.' Hey ladies, who wants some bangers and mash?
Nice. [To Jim] Hey, Halpert, anyone ever tell you you look like Wooly Willy?
Hey, you know what? It was, uh, great to see you all again. Take care. [exits]
Oh here's what you do. Hike up your skirt and pull out your tampon, borrow some balls and come meet me!
There's this guy. He's at a Nymphomaniac Convention. And he is psyched 'cause all these women are smokin' hot perfect 10's, except for this one chick who looks a lot like, uh... [points at Phyllis]
Fat and ugly. You might actually have a chance.
[on the phone] Is this Michael Scott? My secret lover. My intercom, I told you never to call me here. Never! [Michael's laughing]
I've been meaning to ask her one question. Does the carpet match the drapes?
So, that's it. I just wanted to make amends. [slides cupcakes across table to Darryl and Jim]
Don't ever let this little bitch drive you around town. We got, uh, lost for half an hour.
Oh my. They really got to you, didn't they?
[on the phone] Oh, God! Stop whining. You know, you only come to the pick up game once a year. You little bitch. [Michael picks up phone, takes it off speakerphone] All right, yup. Hey, okay. No problem, you know, best you can do. Hey, you know. Hey, nice talking to you too. All right take care. [sighs] Michael Scoot. That's funny. He's a good friend.
Why does everyone ask me that? Who the hell is that?
[high-pitched voice] I saw you on the news and I want to pinch your tiny wiener...  [normal voice] It's Packer!
I don���t see what that gets us, but I���m a team player.
Are you kidding? Everyone knows why! You don't know? Okay, check this out. Al lright. So here's the story. So Randall is nailing his secretary, right? And she is totally incompetent.
[grabbing Michael around the neck] Merry Christmas, asswipe!
Meant to ask you, can you think you can get someone to drive me around because of the, uh, DUI situation?
I am going through a twelve-step program. I'm currently on step zero. Which is have a [expletive] of fun. I spent six hours carefully removing the frosting and then layering in a variety of drugs, some legal, some not. Some laxative, some constipating. You don't fire the Pac-Man and expect to get away with it.
Where is Michael Snot? Sniffing some dude's thong? Probably.
OK. Let's get right to it. I guess. My name is Todd Packer and I am in recovery. I'm working the steps. I'm on step eight of Alcoholics Anonymous and step nine of Narcotics Anonymous. I'm here to make amends. I've been hard to deal with over the past years. Kind of a jerk. I know it. I don't need you to accept my apology, but I'd love it if you did.
Hey, Moonface. Nice to see those shiny, little Chinese eyes of yours.
Hello, yes. I'm looking for a gay nerd named Michael Scott.
No? Wow. I'm in this mode now where I'm apologizing for thoughts that are in my head. [Clark fake laughs] Hey. I have a crazy feeling [hands Clark a cupcake] that you are really gonna like this.
Oh. I'm Todd. Oh, sorry for calling you a fat, little runt earlier.
Dude, I've been here since three! I've boot and rallied twice.
That's... that's the same guy. It's the joke I made.
Schrute���s out to get me. But I���m playing the long game. As soon as he messes up, I swoop in like a sexual predator.
[rapping] What's up my nerds. Check it out. [points at the mistletoe stuck down his pants]
[to Nellie] Are you kidding? [to Robert] She's the queen of the whole freaking Magilla!
When you guys do that whole power of two shebang, how 'bout I pop up also? I guess we'd have to say 'power of three'. Hm, actually, you know what, yeah, that actually works. [to Nellie] You'd spin off right. I'd spin off-
Why can't I just be nice? Truth is, I really like you guys. I really do. OK. The apology���s just half of it. The big thing is making amends. And, that's why I brought these. I went out to the Steamtown Mall and I got you all cupcakes. From that place 'Nipples'.
Hey, uh, I just wanted to say I'm sorry for screwing you.
Huh. The mind sees what it wants to, huh? [hands cupcake to Erin] There you go.
