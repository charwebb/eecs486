There he is. Good one.
Because they need to grip the broom!
[high-pitched voice] I saw you on the news and I want to pinch your tiny wiener...  [normal voice] It's Packer!
What has two thumbs and likes to bone your Mom? [points at self] This guy!
Aw, I'm just trying to-
[sounds sick on the phone] I can't make it.
When you guys do that whole power of two shebang, how 'bout I pop up also? I guess we'd have to say 'power of three'. Hm, actually, you know what, yeah, that actually works. [to Nellie] You'd spin off right. I'd spin off-
[on the phone] Bergerstein!
Sup?
Dude, I've been here since three! I've boot and rallied twice.
Maybe next 'queer.' Hey ladies, who wants some bangers and mash?
That's... that's the same guy. It's the joke I made.
It's OK. I'm over it.
bleep, bleep. What's up, Halpert?
Actually, they have a specific way I need to do this. And, I have to go through examples of stuff.  OK. Uh, where to begin. [to Pam] Hey. Pam-pam and her pam-pams. Wow. I have said some crude things about those. But, they are beautiful. And, I guess that's why I acted out. Pam, I'm sorry I objectified you. And, personified your breasts. Sorry, guys. [to Phyllis] Oh boy. I have not been nice to you. Philly, I'm sorry for the things I said about your size. To your face, behind your back, and in the form of drawings. Actually, that goes to all you double XLs. Stanley, Kevin, [points to Clark] this kid in a few years.
Don't ever let this little bitch drive you around town. We got, uh, lost for half an hour.
No? Wow. I'm in this mode now where I'm apologizing for thoughts that are in my head. [Clark fake laughs] Hey. I have a crazy feeling [hands Clark a cupcake] that you are really gonna like this.
[on the phone] I want my money back you greedy Hebrew. Bergerstein!
Ex-squeeze me?
[makes laser gun noises]
[rapping] What's up my nerds. Check it out. [points at the mistletoe stuck down his pants]
I don���t see what that gets us, but I���m a team player.
Meant to ask you, can you think you can get someone to drive me around because of the, uh, DUI situation?
Why does everyone ask me that? Who the hell is that?
Like 10 words a minute... talking.
[on the phone] Is this Michael Scott? My secret lover. My intercom, I told you never to call me here. Never! [Michael's laughing]
[on the phone] Mello.
So a guy goes home, tells his wife, 'Honey. Pack your bags. I just won the lottery.' She goes, 'Oh my god! That's incredible! Where are we going?' He goes, 'I don't know where you're going, just be out of here by five!' [men laugh] Boom!
Has anyone started calling you 'Gabe-wad' yet?
[on the phone] Bergerstein!
Where is Michael Snot? Sniffing some dude's thong? Probably.
Lame. Why don't witches wear panties?
[to Nellie] Are you kidding? [to Robert] She's the queen of the whole freaking Magilla!
Still queer?
[to Ryan] Come on, kid. Let's go.
OK. Let's get right to it. I guess. My name is Todd Packer and I am in recovery. I'm working the steps. I'm on step eight of Alcoholics Anonymous and step nine of Narcotics Anonymous. I'm here to make amends. I've been hard to deal with over the past years. Kind of a jerk. I know it. I don't need you to accept my apology, but I'd love it if you did.
There he is.
Whoops! [Humps Michael]
I said it. And then, suddenly, for no reason, this bimbo blows the whistle on the whole thing just to be a bitch.
Well, looks like Shnoot's a no-show. Guess he wasn't vice presy material after all. But I am. Put me in, babe. I got the info down backwards, forwards, and doggy-style. I'm your man.
Hey, you know what? It was, uh, great to see you all again. Take care. [exits]
What, you, I, I can't get fired. I'm an institution. I have been at this company for 20 years. How many of you have been here that long, huh? [Dwight exits meeting room and helps Jim up]
[on the phone] I... I'm not coming.
Hello, yes. I'm looking for a gay nerd named Michael Scott.
Why can't I just be nice? Truth is, I really like you guys. I really do. OK. The apology���s just half of it. The big thing is making amends. And, that's why I brought these. I went out to the Steamtown Mall and I got you all cupcakes. From that place 'Nipples'.
Hey, Moonface. Nice to see those shiny, little Chinese eyes of yours.
Yep
Hi, all.
I've been meaning to ask her one question. Does the carpet match the drapes?
Oh. I'm Todd. Oh, sorry for calling you a fat, little runt earlier.
Uh���
Schrute���s out to get me. But I���m playing the long game. As soon as he messes up, I swoop in like a sexual predator.
They are women, right?
I am. It was my rock bottom.
Hey, is old Godzillary coming in today?
[on the phone] Oh, God! Stop whining. You know, you only come to the pick up game once a year. You little bitch. [Michael picks up phone, takes it off speakerphone] All right, yup. Hey, okay. No problem, you know, best you can do. Hey, you know. Hey, nice talking to you too. All right take care. [sighs] Michael Scoot. That's funny. He's a good friend.
Halpert, you lookin' for someone to bang your wife?
I am going through a twelve-step program. I'm currently on step zero. Which is have a [expletive] of fun. I spent six hours carefully removing the frosting and then layering in a variety of drugs, some legal, some not. Some laxative, some constipating. You don't fire the Pac-Man and expect to get away with it.
Huh. The mind sees what it wants to, huh? [hands cupcake to Erin] There you go.
Fat and ugly. You might actually have a chance.
If I may speak to that, I have only been vice president of this project for the last half hour, so the man you want is Dwight Shrute.
So, that's it. I just wanted to make amends. [slides cupcakes across table to Darryl and Jim]
I don't think you get it.
Pacman need a drinky.
Hey, uh, I just wanted to say I'm sorry for screwing you.
Hey what's up, Butt-plug?
