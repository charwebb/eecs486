Cheers.
Oh, uh, no problem. I finished all the bread.
Sure, anytime. Uh, how about you and Jim? Everything squared away?
So...
Yeah, it was cool.
Oh, hey Meredith.
Oh yeah, that's right.
They've got parabolic mikes, they can pick you up a hundred yards away, so...no if you were around there, they got you.
Alright, that's for you. [hands her beer]
No. No, it's...
Yeah, it is.
Let me grab a couple drinks.
It's fine. What are you gonna do, you know? But, if you guys know of any work, I'm fully available.
Uh, listen, they���re cracking down on us talking to the subjects. It���s a lame rule, but, you know, I wanna��� I, I���ll see you later.
Look, if you give me a chance I can, I- [Pam leaves] Pam.
Oh no, hang on a second. Pam, I'm sorry, I- I- I can explain this so much better.
Yeah. That's the thing. When we were fighting, it weirdly felt like the relationship was still alive. And, it wasn't until we stopped fighting that, we realized that it was over. You know, it's over. [overcome by emotion] I'm sorry, this is... oh my god, OK. [to Pam] We have to stop seeing each other like this. We have to find a different way to communicate other than breaking down in front of each other.
No, you're not crazy.
Uh, yeah. Um, you know, Alyssa's, she's not gonna make it today.
Sure.
No no, it's-
No. You, you worked hard on that. That guy's an animal. I'm glad they're firing him too.
They want to know how much what?
Oh, hey!
Yeah. Let���s turn the cameras off. Seriously, guys. Enough. Enough.
No, no, please, yeah, come on in. It's good to see you. Sorry, my place is usually not this-
Actually, we're not gonna make it. Um... we're splitting up.
Look. I don't, I don't wanna put myself where I don't belong. If you ever need me, you just call me. And I'll be there for you.
Pretty much everything.
It's, uh, great to see you guys. Thanks for coming.
Give her a minute. Give her a minute.
Um...
Seeya.
You're gonna hit a woman?
Hey, it���s just a tough situation, all right?
Hi. [laughs]
We were telling two different versions of the same story. And then, everything just went numb.
Hey, hey, hey! [knocks Frank down with boom microphone]
What brings you by?
Yeah, no, I- actually it's always like this. [laughs] Do you want to go outside? It's a little less cluttered out there.
It���s fine. It was my first slip up in nine years of miking you. [phone rings]
That's... OK, great. Does he pay well?
That's not really true, I mean-
It's all good. I knew what I was doing. It's... I'm sorry about your mural, though. I mean, because you put so much into that.
Yeah.
[as Frank gets up] Easy! [Frank grabs him]
Hey.
