Erica, I believe we have a solution to this little problem.
Mr. Garrison, Chef has brought it to my attention that some uh students are a bit... uuuncomfortable about certain aspects of your teaching methods.
No, no, I think I have a better idea.
Eric, it has been almost one year since Corey Duran defecated in his pants here in school. Now, you remember what happened to him?
It has become obvious to me that you don't know enough about evolution to teach it! I'm having you replaced! Mr. Dawkins! 
This is exactly the kind of thing we are always talking about, Eric. You get angry about something, you don't think, and you cause bad things to happen. This time you've done it to yourself!
I was just telling your friends about what I expect of your-
I wanna come clean with you and tell you that back then some of us were uncomfortable with your sexual preferences. It was wrong of us, and I want to make it up to you.
Oookay, but you probably understand that for Pete, it isn't that funny. For him it's embarrassing and terrifying.
Boys and girls, can I have your attention, please? This year we have a very special guest performing the South Park Elementary Bay Of Pigs Memorial Dance. He was a musical force in the '70's and '80's. Please welcome Ronnie James Dio! 
We were wrong for shunning you, Mr. Mackey, and we apologize. We should have realized that you needed help.
And you can't listen to what anybody else tells you.  You have to be willing to give up everything, because the cancer will  take everything. Do you understand?
Yeah, I swore that if I had to see it one more time, I'd put a bullet in my head.  But luckily I got really stoned before I came.
Then it's decided: no more condom classes in grade school.
All right, boys, now what is this fighting all about?
Teachers, I have some bad news. Last night I received a phone call from the local pharmacist. Apparently, almost all of our fourth graders are sexually active. And now that we've scared them a little they're buying condoms to use.
All right, we're going to bring Eric in now, and let's all be as supportive as we can and show him lots of love, okay?
That's better. And now Kyle, maybe you should also admit you were wrong for tattling.
Students and faculty, please put your hands together and help me in welcoming back, Mister Garrison. 
I told you the students would be interested in how much they grew since their last physical.
I just wanted to give you an opportunity to apologize to Mr. Garrison before I send you away, Chef.
Well, Mrs. Broflovski, it certainly is a thrill seeing your cheery face again. What seems to be pissing you off today?
That's wasn't the point, Eric! Nobody was supposed to kill themselves! Unless you fix this our deal is off!
Oh, and Wendy, I almost forgot, we just got a call in the office: your grandma just died.
You sure this will work, Eric? What if some of the students don't eat the pizza?
Where did you get that costume, young man?!
Eric, I've had enough! You cannot and you will not sell your books on school grounds! Do I make myself clear?!
...The Doctors say that Jenny Simon barely survived the fall. Jumping off the school roof fractured her pelvis.
Wait. Are you talking about the numbers we published Tuesday from the physical?
Well, Timmy. I just don't know what to do with you. You're getting very poor marks in school and the teachers are complaining that you aren't paying attention.
Yes, will there be gluten-free options for people at this party?
The school board has decided to discontinue the wrestling program. Wrestling simply involves too much adult subject matter, like murder and abortion. 
Ooookay, thank you, cheerleaders. That was very nice. Ahhh, next we have a student who would like to perform an original rap song,  based on his award-winning poem, "I Was Not The Bullet," with backup music by Butters Stotch. 
Well, Miss... Choksondik, those children did fairly well in the third grade.
No, I'm afraid it's worse than that. By county law I'm bound to enforce the harshest punishment possible.
I see.  I've noticed all the things you've done for Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Did you know I'm a breast cancer survivor?
Thank you for coming, parents. We called you in because we've had a little incident at the school. The fourth grade boys measured their penises and posted results in the school hallway.
What's a bigger story than all the students being made sick?
I'm sorry Erica, but I spoke with Wendyl this morning and she's not comfortable-
We-hell, "sorry" isn't going to cut the cheese this time, mister! I'm afraid I'm going to have to suspend you from school.
I can't, I, umm...I'm very busy.  I send my five dollars a month, see? 
Ah, Ms. Choksondik, can we have a quick word with you?
Eric, we've called you in to commend you for your role as student teacher.
Eric, we've been informed by a concerned student that you are writing naughty books about one of the girls here at the school.
These gentlemen from the Denver County School Board have something they want to ask you.
It's okay, Eric. We all understand and we think you're very brave.
Yes, but you don't actually get involved with the child's life. You're supposed to just send money, and once in a while they write you a letter. You see, Marvin didn't grow up in a normal place like South Park.
And just what is going on here, mister?
Mr. Garrison, last week's charges of attempting to solicit sex from a minor wa-
Wendy Testaburger to the principal's office please? Wendy Testaburger to the principal's office.
Yes, we need to go over it again in the classroom so they understand what really happened.
I'm very sorry, but I'm afraid we have to terminate your employment here at South Park Elementary.
I was diagnosed seven years ago. Cancer is... pure evil. It is a fat little lump that needs to be... destroyed.  When there is a cancer, you have to "fight" it. You can't reason with cancer, you can't wish it away. Cancer doesn't play by the rules, so neither can you.
That isn't the only reason you're being let go.
All right, all right, fine. Eric, you lead the class.
Is that true, Eric? Did you give Kyle AIDS?
As you know, the position of Fourth Grade teacher has become available, and we'd like to offer YOU the job.
Aaand, let me just make a few quickie alterations, and there ya go, young man. 
You'll just have to share, Eric. Why can't you understand that?
We had to let them go home, and one of them now has half a lid of Jamaican grass because of you!
The job is to read what is written on the paper, Eric, not to embellish the way you do.
Stanley, do you have a reason for not using the boys bathroom?
And so apparently there's been a little mixup. The manatees were meant to go to the Denver Shelter Aquarium and the frogs were meant to come here.
I understand it's been difficult, Mrs. Garrison, and so, Mr. Donaldson has come from the Tourette's Tolerance and Understanding Foundation. 
The numbers we put up were height differentials. 
I want to know just what makes you think it's okay to go inside the girls bathroom!
Well, Ms. Makaraqesh, you certainly tried to put one over on us, boy howdy. Take her away!
-but just make sure that this new little trend doesn't become a distraction. 
Now, we realize this issue can have a troubling effect that can get blown out of proportion.
If Pete Melman does not kill himself,  we will make it very worth your while.
Very well. But there is to be no more throwing of feces. Understood??
That's right. I think you owe Kyle an apology.
All right. Will you people stop barging into my office, please?
Really? Mwell I might just give this gluten-free thing a try. How does it work?
Sooo Eric Cartman just has us in some kind of bathroom checkmate?
Eric, as you might have heard, a student here in South Park Elementary had an accident in the classroom.
After leading your class through review, your schoolmates scored higher than they ever had on their tests. Whatever you did really worked on them.
No, it's just that the announcements need to be quick so the students can get on with their work.
And so it is with great pride that I can announce the student body has elected to get rid of the transgender bathroom, and give any fellow student the right to use the bathroom they feel most comfortable in. 
We... found all the gay porn on your iPhone, Mr. Connors.
Why did you measure all the boy students' penis sizes and put the results on the school bulletin board?!
Sshh! Oh, God bless America.  You get into my office before anyone else sees you. I have to show you an educational video.
But why is Mr. Mackey doing this now?
J-Lo, can we get a picture of you with the kids?
Right, so the issue, as you all know, is that Butters set fire to the gymnasium last week and ran away laughing and flipping everyone off.
Well, how about we make you a new costume. Let's see now.  Aha, thought of something. How about we make you a nice scary ghost costume?
Why would we publish the lengths of our students' private parts?
Did you infect Kyle with the HIV virus, yes or no?!
Oh yes, uh, Mr. Garrison, have a seat
Stan Marsh, to the principal's office. Stan Marsh to the principal's office immediately!
Well, why the hell would you dress up like Evel Knievel?  Anyway, I hope that you kids are-Daagh!  Eric, God bless it, what do you think you're doing?!
We've simply had it with your son, Mr. and Mrs. Marsh. Voting just doesn't appear to be important to him.
Boys, the reason we called you all in is because one of your friends... has a serious illness. Eric Cartman has been diagnosed with HIV.
Now, just lead a review over whatever Mr. Garrison's been teaching you, and I'll be back to check on you shortly.  Well well well. Who's teacher now?  Yeahhh. Who's teacher?!
Well, you boys have certainly done it this time!
...Oh. Anywho, I want you all to meet your new substitute, Ms. Ellen. 
With all the new laws we could never fire you for being gay now. You'd be able to sue us for millions of dollars.
You are to sit in class and help Mr. Dawkins with whatever he needs!
Uhh, who, who else would like to be teacher for the day? Anybody else? 
Well, whatever happened to him happened at the planetarium.
If anyone doesn't, you have the authority to bring them to me.
When you have cancer you fight, because it doesn't matter if you beat it or not. You refuse to let that fat little lump make you feel powerless!
Yes, we apologize for Eric Cartman's behavior, Mr. Nelson. We feel terrible.
Ehsooo, I hear that the South Park Cows are playing for the State Finals in dodgeball tonight.
Okay, parents. I know a lot of you want a chance to speak, but we have to talk one at a time.
Well, you have to admit he does look a little better.
Ooohh, yeess, a Conjoined Twin Myslexia Awareness Week. You know, that has a nice ring.
I'm sorry, but your son is distracting the other students and his attitude is just getting worse.
Eric, I've had a lot of complaints that your online persona is becoming a distraction.
Children, I have some difficult news for you. Mr. Garrison won't be teaching for a while. He has to have surgery.  So you're going to have a substitute teacher.  And I want you to show the substitute the same respect you show for Mr. Garrison.  Yes, little boy?
Miss Stevenson, I will need to inform the police.
Eric Cartman, report to the principal's office immediately.
You are not transgender, Eric! You don't even know what that means!
Our students want to learn, Mrs. Garrison, and they're mature enough to handle anything.
Not as sorry as you're going to be when your parents get here! Ah, here they come now. 
If it is agreeable to you, Erica, we are going to clear out the janitor's closet and remodel it into a private bathroom just for you! 
Well, I'll talk to Nurse Gollum, but I'm sure she'll be delighted. Let's say around 8?
I'm afraid that's impossible. Nobody's seen Mr. Garrison since the last school year ended.
Now, kids, I understand that you are very into this "vampire" thing, but I don't want to see it get out of hand. You kids need to understand that your new little fad is scary to some.
But he could be anywhere up high in those mountains.
Ooohh, so I suppose that's out. Uh-how about a hat, then?
Eric, the reason we called you in here is because it is your turn to be the school hallway monitor. 
Don't listen to them, kids. You have to go to school.
Well, I guess that's the grown-up way to put it, yes.
We in administration see now that you are an individual with your own preferences, and we respect that.
We thought it would be fun to put up how much each student has grown in height since their physical last year. You grew 1.2 inches.
Okay, thank you very much. Yes, you can pick him up tonight. Bye now.  Now boys, I hope you've learned your lesson.
All right, well if you identify yourself as a girl, you must find yourself attracted to boys. Is that right?!
Wendy, I've been hearing rumors about a fight between you and Eric Cartman.
Ah, could you please use a little different terminology?
Hello there, children. Ooh, love the Elvis costume, Chef.
Sir, if you don't wish your daughter to learn about evolution, then we can pull her out of class.
Did you say a fetus, sticking out from her head?
All right, students, members of the school board. Our last speaker will discuss the important role of Latinos in the arts. Here is... Eric Cartman.  Eric Cartman? 
Now hold on a minute, I think we're being a little drastic here. You know, I probably see a boy in my office once a week for farting on a girl. 
There, there, now. Maybe this will all blow over someday and we can give you a job as a janitor cleaning up vomit with that pink sawdust stuff.
Attention, students. Don't forget that this Friday night is the South Park Elementary Bay Of Pigs Memorial Dance. We will have a very special band performing, so please come early.
Anyone who has a problem sharing a bathroom with people who might be transgender will have to use the special designated bathroom designed to keep them away from the normal people who don't care.
Kyle, these men have apparently come all the way from Israel to speak with me, but... we need a translator.
I am very disappointed in you, young man. You should be ashamed of yourself. What could have possessed you to be so stupid? 
Mr. Mackey, so far the school has spent  $22,000 on the IntelliLink system, and so far it's been an unmitigated disaster.
Listen Eric! You must know why we can't have you in the girls bathroom!
In the cheeks, you don't think he looks a little fuller?
Well I've been gluten-free for about a day now, and I have to say I feel sooo amazing. I just want to make sure there's food for all of us.
Very well, Mr. Nelson.  Stacey, go ahead and send in Eric Cartman.  Eric, Mr. Nelson is concerned about how you respond to little people.
And then he was accused of trying to solicit sex from a young boy.
You see that, parents? Your children have refused to come into class since this morning. I'm afraid your son is the leader, Ms. Cartman.  Apparently he's read the entire Bible, and now he's scaring the hell out of everyone.
You demonstrate a lack of tolerance for Mr. Garrison's behavior. In fact, I believe you used the words "sick queer" to describe his conduct in class?
Luckily for us, one of you had enough of a conscience to come forward.
Oh, this new fourth-grade teacher is driving me nuts!
Good luck, Ms. Ellen. If they get out of control, just use this tear gas, okay. 
But this isn't a hurting confused child we're talking about. It's Eric Cartman.
Okay, before we get started with this PTA meeting, does anyone have any outstanding issues?
But you started it. Mr. Broflovski, tell him what you told us.
You can appeal to the city council, but I don't think it'll do any good. Your son must leave South Park, never to return.
Mr. Gar- Mr. Garrison!  Could we speak with you please?
I think tonight the planetarium is doing Laser Loggins. I might have to check it out.
Oh, looks like the weather might turn shitty.
No, we're sending Chef to a tolerance seminar.
All students are to evacuate the school immediately! 
Yes, Mr. Mackey, we're all aware that you're gluten-free now.
Mrs. Garrison, evolution is in the school curriculum. We have to teach it.
Oh. Well, there was the case out in Minnesota where the guy was awarded... 25 million, I think.
Ooookay students, um, obviously we've had a little emergency with your teacher, so uh, while we deal with this, we need one of you to lead the class and review for tomorrow's quiz.
He finally snapped and had a nervous breakdown and... went up into the mountains to live in solitude.
Well, my hands are tied. We can no longer have Stan's behavior jeopardizing the other children. He must be removed.
I know that you aren't really vampires, and I appreciate that you wanna be cool because vampires are the "in" thing right now, but-
Now now, boys' fascination with their genitalia is a natural thing. We... simply need to find a way to help the students understand what they've done.
Well, not any more than any other student.
But how old do you think a student should be when they learn about proper condom use?
