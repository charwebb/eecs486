That's right. I think you owe Kyle an apology.

Ooohh, so I suppose that's out. Uh-how about a hat, then?

Well, whatever happened to him happened at the planetarium.

I see.  I've noticed all the things you've done for Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Did you know I'm a breast cancer survivor?

I can't, I, umm...I'm very busy.  I send my five dollars a month, see? 

Uhh, who, who else would like to be teacher for the day? Anybody else? 

What's a bigger story than all the students being made sick?

If Pete Melman does not kill himself,  we will make it very worth your while.

As you know, the position of Fourth Grade teacher has become available, and we'd like to offer YOU the job.

I was diagnosed seven years ago. Cancer is... pure evil. It is a fat little lump that needs to be... destroyed.  When there is a cancer, you have to "fight" it. You can't reason with cancer, you can't wish it away. Cancer doesn't play by the rules, so neither can you.

Yes, we need to go over it again in the classroom so they understand what really happened.

With all the new laws we could never fire you for being gay now. You'd be able to sue us for millions of dollars.

Eric, it has been almost one year since Corey Duran defecated in his pants here in school. Now, you remember what happened to him?

So did you ever think of just, you know, having it cut off?

I'm sorry, but your son is distracting the other students and his attitude is just getting worse.

Now, just lead a review over whatever Mr. Garrison's been teaching you, and I'll be back to check on you shortly.  Well well well. Who's teacher now?  Yeahhh. Who's teacher?!

And just what is going on here, mister?

Teachers, I have some bad news. Last night I received a phone call from the local pharmacist. Apparently, almost all of our fourth graders are sexually active. And now that we've scared them a little they're buying condoms to use.

I'm sorry, the board has made up their minds.

That's better. And now Kyle, maybe you should also admit you were wrong for tattling.

And so apparently there's been a little mixup. The manatees were meant to go to the Denver Shelter Aquarium and the frogs were meant to come here.

But he could be anywhere up high in those mountains.

No, no, I think I have a better idea.

Did you infect Kyle with the HIV virus, yes or no?!

Ooookay, thank you, cheerleaders. That was very nice. Ahhh, next we have a student who would like to perform an original rap song,  based on his award-winning poem, "I Was Not The Bullet," with backup music by Butters Stotch. 

But how old do you think a student should be when they learn about proper condom use?

Then it's decided: no more condom classes in grade school.

...The Doctors say that Jenny Simon barely survived the fall. Jumping off the school roof fractured her pelvis.

No, I'm afraid it's worse than that. By county law I'm bound to enforce the harshest punishment possible.

Well, why the hell would you dress up like Evel Knievel?  Anyway, I hope that you kids are-Daagh!  Eric, God bless it, what do you think you're doing?!

Ooookay students, um, obviously we've had a little emergency with your teacher, so uh, while we deal with this, we need one of you to lead the class and review for tomorrow's quiz.

We... found all the gay porn on your iPhone, Mr. Connors.

J-Lo, can we get a picture of you with the kids?

Yes, but you don't actually get involved with the child's life. You're supposed to just send money, and once in a while they write you a letter. You see, Marvin didn't grow up in a normal place like South Park.

That's wasn't the point, Eric! Nobody was supposed to kill themselves! Unless you fix this our deal is off!

Did you say a fetus, sticking out from her head?

I just wanted to give you an opportunity to apologize to Mr. Garrison before I send you away, Chef.

Oh. I'm sorry, we don't hire gay people. 

Now, kids, I understand that you are very into this "vampire" thing, but I don't want to see it get out of hand. You kids need to understand that your new little fad is scary to some.

I am very disappointed in you, young man. You should be ashamed of yourself. What could have possessed you to be so stupid? 

Luckily for us, one of you had enough of a conscience to come forward.

Okay, before we get started with this PTA meeting, does anyone have any outstanding issues?

These gentlemen from the Denver County School Board have something they want to ask you.

Mr. Garrison, last week's charges of attempting to solicit sex from a minor wa-

Good luck, Ms. Ellen. If they get out of control, just use this tear gas, okay. 

After leading your class through review, your schoolmates scored higher than they ever had on their tests. Whatever you did really worked on them.

All right, all right, I killed him. I hit him over the head and I cut up the body. I tried to burn him, but it wouldn't burn! Oh, the smell of it! I put the legs in garbage bags and hid the torso under a bridge. I HAD TO DO IT!!  OH GOD!!!

We-hell, "sorry" isn't going to cut the cheese this time, mister! I'm afraid I'm going to have to suspend you from school.

And then he was accused of trying to solicit sex from a young boy.

Okay, parents. I know a lot of you want a chance to speak, but we have to talk one at a time.

Is that true, Eric? Did you give Kyle AIDS?

Children, I have some difficult news for you. Mr. Garrison won't be teaching for a while. He has to have surgery.  So you're going to have a substitute teacher.  And I want you to show the substitute the same respect you show for Mr. Garrison.  Yes, little boy?

That isn't the only reason you're being let go.

Where did you get that costume, young man?!

Well, I was just saying that the policies have really changed. You know, we fire you for acting gay next time, you'd be able to sue the school district for ...lots of money.

Eric, as you might have heard, a student here in South Park Elementary had an accident in the classroom.

He finally snapped and had a nervous breakdown and... went up into the mountains to live in solitude.

Why would we publish the lengths of our students' private parts?

Mr. Mackey, so far the school has spent  $22,000 on the IntelliLink system, and so far it's been an unmitigated disaster.

Anyone who has a problem sharing a bathroom with people who might be transgender will have to use the special designated bathroom designed to keep them away from the normal people who don't care.

And you can't listen to what anybody else tells you.  You have to be willing to give up everything, because the cancer will  take everything. Do you understand?

Well, I'll talk to Nurse Gollum, but I'm sure she'll be delighted. Let's say around 8?

You'll just have to share, Eric. Why can't you understand that?

But this isn't a hurting confused child we're talking about. It's Eric Cartman.

We've simply had it with your son, Mr. and Mrs. Marsh. Voting just doesn't appear to be important to him.

Attention, students. Don't forget that this Friday night is the South Park Elementary Bay Of Pigs Memorial Dance. We will have a very special band performing, so please come early.

Stanley, do you have a reason for not using the boys bathroom?

Oh, this new fourth-grade teacher is driving me nuts!

Our students want to learn, Mrs. Garrison, and they're mature enough to handle anything.

If it is agreeable to you, Erica, we are going to clear out the janitor's closet and remodel it into a private bathroom just for you! 

Sooo Eric Cartman just has us in some kind of bathroom checkmate?

Not as sorry as you're going to be when your parents get here! Ah, here they come now. 

Well, how about we make you a new costume. Let's see now.  Aha, thought of something. How about we make you a nice scary ghost costume?

But why is Mr. Mackey doing this now?

No, it's just that the announcements need to be quick so the students can get on with their work.

Well, Timmy. I just don't know what to do with you. You're getting very poor marks in school and the teachers are complaining that you aren't paying attention.

It's okay, Eric. We all understand and we think you're very brave.

Ehsooo, I hear that the South Park Cows are playing for the State Finals in dodgeball tonight.

Ah, Ms. Choksondik, can we have a quick word with you?

Mrs. Garrison, evolution is in the school curriculum. We have to teach it.

Eric, the reason we called you in here is because it is your turn to be the school hallway monitor. 

You can appeal to the city council, but I don't think it'll do any good. Your son must leave South Park, never to return.

Well I've been gluten-free for about a day now, and I have to say I feel sooo amazing. I just want to make sure there's food for all of us.

I wanna come clean with you and tell you that back then some of us were uncomfortable with your sexual preferences. It was wrong of us, and I want to make it up to you.

All right, all right, fine. Eric, you lead the class.

The numbers we put up were height differentials. 

Eric, I've had a lot of complaints that your online persona is becoming a distraction.

This story hasn't gone up on Eavesdropper yet. Maybe it won't!

Yes, Mr. Mackey, we're all aware that you're gluten-free now.

When you have cancer you fight, because it doesn't matter if you beat it or not. You refuse to let that fat little lump make you feel powerless!

"Ike, I long to feel your arms around me"?? Miss Stevenson, you- you're having a relationship with this student?

Mr. Garrison, Chef has brought it to my attention that some uh students are a bit... uuuncomfortable about certain aspects of your teaching methods.

I know that you aren't really vampires, and I appreciate that you wanna be cool because vampires are the "in" thing right now, but-

Now, we realize this issue can have a troubling effect that can get blown out of proportion.

You are not transgender, Eric! You don't even know what that means!

Oh, looks like the weather might turn shitty.

Well, Mrs. Broflovski, it certainly is a thrill seeing your cheery face again. What seems to be pissing you off today?

Very well. But there is to be no more throwing of feces. Understood??

Well, Miss... Choksondik, those children did fairly well in the third grade.

Well, I guess that's the grown-up way to put it, yes.

...Oh. Anywho, I want you all to meet your new substitute, Ms. Ellen. 

The school board has decided to discontinue the wrestling program. Wrestling simply involves too much adult subject matter, like murder and abortion. 

Oh. Well, there was the case out in Minnesota where the guy was awarded... 25 million, I think.

We thought it would be fun to put up how much each student has grown in height since their physical last year. You grew 1.2 inches.

Eric, we've called you in to commend you for your role as student teacher.

Ooohh, yeess, a Conjoined Twin Myslexia Awareness Week. You know, that has a nice ring.

We in administration see now that you are an individual with your own preferences, and we respect that.

Now now, boys' fascination with their genitalia is a natural thing. We... simply need to find a way to help the students understand what they've done.

This is exactly the kind of thing we are always talking about, Eric. You get angry about something, you don't think, and you cause bad things to happen. This time you've done it to yourself!

Sir, if you don't wish your daughter to learn about evolution, then we can pull her out of class.

I understand it's been difficult, Mrs. Garrison, and so, Mr. Donaldson has come from the Tourette's Tolerance and Understanding Foundation. 

Sshh! Oh, God bless America.  You get into my office before anyone else sees you. I have to show you an educational video.

Stan Marsh, to the principal's office. Stan Marsh to the principal's office immediately!

Yes, we apologize for Eric Cartman's behavior, Mr. Nelson. We feel terrible.

Listen Eric! You must know why we can't have you in the girls bathroom!

Yeah, I swore that if I had to see it one more time, I'd put a bullet in my head.  But luckily I got really stoned before I came.

In the cheeks, you don't think he looks a little fuller?

Why did you measure all the boy students' penis sizes and put the results on the school bulletin board?!

Wait. Are you talking about the numbers we published Tuesday from the physical?

All right. Will you people stop barging into my office, please?

All right, students, members of the school board. Our last speaker will discuss the important role of Latinos in the arts. Here is... Eric Cartman.  Eric Cartman? 

Wendy Testaburger to the principal's office please? Wendy Testaburger to the principal's office.

If anyone doesn't, you have the authority to bring them to me.

Eric, I've had enough! You cannot and you will not sell your books on school grounds! Do I make myself clear?!

Okay, Eric, you got what you wanted. Are we straight?

There, there, now. Maybe this will all blow over someday and we can give you a job as a janitor cleaning up vomit with that pink sawdust stuff.

You are to sit in class and help Mr. Dawkins with whatever he needs!

Eric, we've been informed by a concerned student that you are writing naughty books about one of the girls here at the school.

All we ask is you keep it shorter.

Oh, and Wendy, I almost forgot, we just got a call in the office: your grandma just died.

Oookay, but you probably understand that for Pete, it isn't that funny. For him it's embarrassing and terrifying.

I think tonight the planetarium is doing Laser Loggins. I might have to check it out.

All students are to evacuate the school immediately! 

The job is to read what is written on the paper, Eric, not to embellish the way you do.

Alright Eric, here's the deal: This school cannot have another suicide on its hands. We want you to see Pete Melman through this, and turn public opinion around.

Yes, Mr. Garrison. Have a seat.  Mr. Garrison, sometime ago you asked to be promoted from teaching kindergarten back to the third grade.

All right, we're going to bring Eric in now, and let's all be as supportive as we can and show him lots of love, okay?

All right, well if you identify yourself as a girl, you must find yourself attracted to boys. Is that right?!

No, we're sending Chef to a tolerance seminar.

Really? Mwell I might just give this gluten-free thing a try. How does it work?

Well, not any more than any other student.

Don't listen to them, kids. You have to go to school.

Kyle, these men have apparently come all the way from Israel to speak with me, but... we need a translator.

Now hold on a minute, I think we're being a little drastic here. You know, I probably see a boy in my office once a week for farting on a girl. 

It was an error of judgment, Mr. Mackey, but I'm afraid I have to let you go for it. We searched each one of those kids, but came up empty.

All right, boys, now what is this fighting all about?

I'm afraid that's impossible. Nobody's seen Mr. Garrison since the last school year ended.

I was just telling your friends about what I expect of your-

And so it is with great pride that I can announce the student body has elected to get rid of the transgender bathroom, and give any fellow student the right to use the bathroom they feel most comfortable in. 

Eric Cartman, report to the principal's office immediately.

Okay, thank you very much. Yes, you can pick him up tonight. Bye now.  Now boys, I hope you've learned your lesson.

Wendy, I've been hearing rumors about a fight between you and Eric Cartman.

Boys, the reason we called you all in is because one of your friends... has a serious illness. Eric Cartman has been diagnosed with HIV.

Ah, could you please use a little different terminology?

Now, you did say she has a fetus on her head?

Well, you boys have certainly done it this time!

-but just make sure that this new little trend doesn't become a distraction. 

But you started it. Mr. Broflovski, tell him what you told us.

Aaand, let me just make a few quickie alterations, and there ya go, young man. 

Well, my hands are tied. We can no longer have Stan's behavior jeopardizing the other children. He must be removed.

Well, Ms. Makaraqesh, you certainly tried to put one over on us, boy howdy. Take her away!

Right, so the issue, as you all know, is that Butters set fire to the gymnasium last week and ran away laughing and flipping everyone off.

You see that, parents? Your children have refused to come into class since this morning. I'm afraid your son is the leader, Ms. Cartman.  Apparently he's read the entire Bible, and now he's scaring the hell out of everyone.

We were wrong for shunning you, Mr. Mackey, and we apologize. We should have realized that you needed help.

Hello there, children. Ooh, love the Elvis costume, Chef.

Boys and girls, can I have your attention, please? This year we have a very special guest performing the South Park Elementary Bay Of Pigs Memorial Dance. He was a musical force in the '70's and '80's. Please welcome Ronnie James Dio! 

I'm sorry Mr. Garrison, but it's obvious you aren't tolerant of your own behavior.

Thank you for coming, parents. We called you in because we've had a little incident at the school. The fourth grade boys measured their penises and posted results in the school hallway.

Erica, I believe we have a solution to this little problem.

Very well, Mr. Nelson.  Stacey, go ahead and send in Eric Cartman.  Eric, Mr. Nelson is concerned about how you respond to little people.
