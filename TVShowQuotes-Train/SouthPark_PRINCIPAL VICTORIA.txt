I wanna come clean with you and tell you that back then some of us were uncomfortable with your sexual preferences. It was wrong of us, and I want to make it up to you.
Yeah, I swore that if I had to see it one more time, I'd put a bullet in my head.  But luckily I got really stoned before I came.
Very well. But there is to be no more throwing of feces. Understood??
Our students want to learn, Mrs. Garrison, and they're mature enough to handle anything.
Boys and girls, can I have your attention, please? This year we have a very special guest performing the South Park Elementary Bay Of Pigs Memorial Dance. He was a musical force in the '70's and '80's. Please welcome Ronnie James Dio! 
Okay, thank you very much. Yes, you can pick him up tonight. Bye now.  Now boys, I hope you've learned your lesson.
Well, whatever happened to him happened at the planetarium.
All right, well if you identify yourself as a girl, you must find yourself attracted to boys. Is that right?!
Stan Marsh, to the principal's office. Stan Marsh to the principal's office immediately!
Listen Eric! You must know why we can't have you in the girls bathroom!
You are to sit in class and help Mr. Dawkins with whatever he needs!
Yes, we apologize for Eric Cartman's behavior, Mr. Nelson. We feel terrible.
Ehsooo, I hear that the South Park Cows are playing for the State Finals in dodgeball tonight.
But he could be anywhere up high in those mountains.
Well, that does it! I'm suspending you, Timmy, until you can learn to respect your elders! 
Well, not any more than any other student.
If anyone doesn't, you have the authority to bring them to me.
Yes, we need to go over it again in the classroom so they understand what really happened.
Ooookay, thank you, cheerleaders. That was very nice. Ahhh, next we have a student who would like to perform an original rap song,  based on his award-winning poem, "I Was Not The Bullet," with backup music by Butters Stotch. 
Okay, before we get started with this PTA meeting, does anyone have any outstanding issues?
Alright Eric, here's the deal: This school cannot have another suicide on its hands. We want you to see Pete Melman through this, and turn public opinion around.
Really? Mwell I might just give this gluten-free thing a try. How does it work?
Well, I guess that's the grown-up way to put it, yes.
Mr. Garrison, last week's charges of attempting to solicit sex from a minor wa-
Is that true, Eric? Did you give Kyle AIDS?
...Oh. Anywho, I want you all to meet your new substitute, Ms. Ellen. 
Good luck, Ms. Ellen. If they get out of control, just use this tear gas, okay. 
And so it is with great pride that I can announce the student body has elected to get rid of the transgender bathroom, and give any fellow student the right to use the bathroom they feel most comfortable in. 
Well, I'll talk to Nurse Gollum, but I'm sure she'll be delighted. Let's say around 8?
Now, kids, I understand that you are very into this "vampire" thing, but I don't want to see it get out of hand. You kids need to understand that your new little fad is scary to some.
Miss Stevenson, I will need to inform the police.
And just what is going on here, mister?
Erica, I believe we have a solution to this little problem.
Oh yes, uh, Mr. Garrison, have a seat
Eric, we've called you in to commend you for your role as student teacher.
Luckily for us, one of you had enough of a conscience to come forward.
Well, Mrs. Broflovski, it certainly is a thrill seeing your cheery face again. What seems to be pissing you off today?
It's okay, Eric. We all understand and we think you're very brave.
We in administration see now that you are an individual with your own preferences, and we respect that.
Well, how about we make you a new costume. Let's see now.  Aha, thought of something. How about we make you a nice scary ghost costume?
I'm sorry, the board has made up their minds.
Eric, I've had enough! You cannot and you will not sell your books on school grounds! Do I make myself clear?!
So did you ever think of just, you know, having it cut off?
I'm sorry Mr. Garrison, but it's obvious you aren't tolerant of your own behavior.
We were wrong for shunning you, Mr. Mackey, and we apologize. We should have realized that you needed help.
I am very disappointed in you, young man. You should be ashamed of yourself. What could have possessed you to be so stupid? 
Okay, parents. I know a lot of you want a chance to speak, but we have to talk one at a time.
And then he was accused of trying to solicit sex from a young boy.
I'm sorry Erica, but I spoke with Wendyl this morning and she's not comfortable-
The numbers we put up were height differentials. 
I just wanted to give you an opportunity to apologize to Mr. Garrison before I send you away, Chef.
All we ask is you keep it shorter.
It was an error of judgment, Mr. Mackey, but I'm afraid I have to let you go for it. We searched each one of those kids, but came up empty.
I'm very sorry, but I'm afraid we have to terminate your employment here at South Park Elementary.
Now now, boys' fascination with their genitalia is a natural thing. We... simply need to find a way to help the students understand what they've done.
Ah, Ms. Choksondik, can we have a quick word with you?
All right, students, members of the school board. Our last speaker will discuss the important role of Latinos in the arts. Here is... Eric Cartman.  Eric Cartman? 
All students are to evacuate the school immediately! 
Well, Miss... Choksondik, those children did fairly well in the third grade.
No, it's just that the announcements need to be quick so the students can get on with their work.
Mrs. Garrison, I am pulling you out of the classroom.
You demonstrate a lack of tolerance for Mr. Garrison's behavior. In fact, I believe you used the words "sick queer" to describe his conduct in class?
It has become obvious to me that you don't know enough about evolution to teach it! I'm having you replaced! Mr. Dawkins! 
Now, you did say she has a fetus on her head?
The school board has decided to discontinue the wrestling program. Wrestling simply involves too much adult subject matter, like murder and abortion. 
Well, you have to admit he does look a little better.
Now, we realize this issue can have a troubling effect that can get blown out of proportion.
If it is agreeable to you, Erica, we are going to clear out the janitor's closet and remodel it into a private bathroom just for you! 
What's a bigger story than all the students being made sick?
Don't listen to them, kids. You have to go to school.
I think tonight the planetarium is doing Laser Loggins. I might have to check it out.
I'm sorry, but your son is distracting the other students and his attitude is just getting worse.
All right, boys, now what is this fighting all about?
Uhh, who, who else would like to be teacher for the day? Anybody else? 
J-Lo, can we get a picture of you with the kids?
We've simply had it with your son, Mr. and Mrs. Marsh. Voting just doesn't appear to be important to him.
When you have cancer you fight, because it doesn't matter if you beat it or not. You refuse to let that fat little lump make you feel powerless!
I know that you aren't really vampires, and I appreciate that you wanna be cool because vampires are the "in" thing right now, but-
The job is to read what is written on the paper, Eric, not to embellish the way you do.
Yes, but you don't actually get involved with the child's life. You're supposed to just send money, and once in a while they write you a letter. You see, Marvin didn't grow up in a normal place like South Park.
Very well, Mr. Nelson.  Stacey, go ahead and send in Eric Cartman.  Eric, Mr. Nelson is concerned about how you respond to little people.
I'm afraid that's impossible. Nobody's seen Mr. Garrison since the last school year ended.
You'll just have to share, Eric. Why can't you understand that?
Where did you get that costume, young man?!
Ooohh, so I suppose that's out. Uh-how about a hat, then?
Then it's decided: no more condom classes in grade school.
In the cheeks, you don't think he looks a little fuller?
All right, all right, I killed him. I hit him over the head and I cut up the body. I tried to burn him, but it wouldn't burn! Oh, the smell of it! I put the legs in garbage bags and hid the torso under a bridge. I HAD TO DO IT!!  OH GOD!!!
Mr. Garrison, Chef has brought it to my attention that some uh students are a bit... uuuncomfortable about certain aspects of your teaching methods.
Wendy Testaburger to the principal's office please? Wendy Testaburger to the principal's office.
"Ike, I long to feel your arms around me"?? Miss Stevenson, you- you're having a relationship with this student?
If Pete Melman does not kill himself,  we will make it very worth your while.
As you know, the position of Fourth Grade teacher has become available, and we'd like to offer YOU the job.
That's better. And now Kyle, maybe you should also admit you were wrong for tattling.
We... found all the gay porn on your iPhone, Mr. Connors.
We had to let them go home, and one of them now has half a lid of Jamaican grass because of you!
All right. Will you people stop barging into my office, please?
You see that, parents? Your children have refused to come into class since this morning. I'm afraid your son is the leader, Ms. Cartman.  Apparently he's read the entire Bible, and now he's scaring the hell out of everyone.
There, there, now. Maybe this will all blow over someday and we can give you a job as a janitor cleaning up vomit with that pink sawdust stuff.
Ooohh, yeess, a Conjoined Twin Myslexia Awareness Week. You know, that has a nice ring.
Wait. Are you talking about the numbers we published Tuesday from the physical?
Why would we publish the lengths of our students' private parts?
Thank you for coming, parents. We called you in because we've had a little incident at the school. The fourth grade boys measured their penises and posted results in the school hallway.
I see.  I've noticed all the things you've done for Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Did you know I'm a breast cancer survivor?
...The Doctors say that Jenny Simon barely survived the fall. Jumping off the school roof fractured her pelvis.
After leading your class through review, your schoolmates scored higher than they ever had on their tests. Whatever you did really worked on them.
Not as sorry as you're going to be when your parents get here! Ah, here they come now. 
I was just telling your friends about what I expect of your-
All right, all right, fine. Eric, you lead the class.
I told you the students would be interested in how much they grew since their last physical.
I understand it's been difficult, Mrs. Garrison, and so, Mr. Donaldson has come from the Tourette's Tolerance and Understanding Foundation. 
Sir, if you don't wish your daughter to learn about evolution, then we can pull her out of class.
Children, I have some difficult news for you. Mr. Garrison won't be teaching for a while. He has to have surgery.  So you're going to have a substitute teacher.  And I want you to show the substitute the same respect you show for Mr. Garrison.  Yes, little boy?
This story hasn't gone up on Eavesdropper yet. Maybe it won't!
Well I've been gluten-free for about a day now, and I have to say I feel sooo amazing. I just want to make sure there's food for all of us.
Sooo Eric Cartman just has us in some kind of bathroom checkmate?
Teachers, I have some bad news. Last night I received a phone call from the local pharmacist. Apparently, almost all of our fourth graders are sexually active. And now that we've scared them a little they're buying condoms to use.
Ah, could you please use a little different terminology?
That's right. I think you owe Kyle an apology.
With all the new laws we could never fire you for being gay now. You'd be able to sue us for millions of dollars.
Well, my hands are tied. We can no longer have Stan's behavior jeopardizing the other children. He must be removed.
Aaand, let me just make a few quickie alterations, and there ya go, young man. 
Oh. Well, there was the case out in Minnesota where the guy was awarded... 25 million, I think.
These gentlemen from the Denver County School Board have something they want to ask you.
Attention, students. Don't forget that this Friday night is the South Park Elementary Bay Of Pigs Memorial Dance. We will have a very special band performing, so please come early.
Mrs. Garrison, evolution is in the school curriculum. We have to teach it.
But why is Mr. Mackey doing this now?
But how old do you think a student should be when they learn about proper condom use?
Stanley, do you have a reason for not using the boys bathroom?
He finally snapped and had a nervous breakdown and... went up into the mountains to live in solitude.
Now hold on a minute, I think we're being a little drastic here. You know, I probably see a boy in my office once a week for farting on a girl. 
Mr. Gar- Mr. Garrison!  Could we speak with you please?
Anyone who has a problem sharing a bathroom with people who might be transgender will have to use the special designated bathroom designed to keep them away from the normal people who don't care.
This is exactly the kind of thing we are always talking about, Eric. You get angry about something, you don't think, and you cause bad things to happen. This time you've done it to yourself!
Eric, the reason we called you in here is because it is your turn to be the school hallway monitor. 
That's wasn't the point, Eric! Nobody was supposed to kill themselves! Unless you fix this our deal is off!
Okay, Eric, you got what you wanted. Are we straight?
Sshh! Oh, God bless America.  You get into my office before anyone else sees you. I have to show you an educational video.
That isn't the only reason you're being let go.
We-hell, "sorry" isn't going to cut the cheese this time, mister! I'm afraid I'm going to have to suspend you from school.
You are not transgender, Eric! You don't even know what that means!
Well, Ms. Makaraqesh, you certainly tried to put one over on us, boy howdy. Take her away!
Did you infect Kyle with the HIV virus, yes or no?!
Students and faculty, please put your hands together and help me in welcoming back, Mister Garrison. 
Yes, Mr. Mackey, we're all aware that you're gluten-free now.
Wendy, I've been hearing rumors about a fight between you and Eric Cartman.
No, no, I think I have a better idea.
You'd better brace yourself, parents. The boys were caught... smoking!
Oh, looks like the weather might turn shitty.
Oh, and Wendy, I almost forgot, we just got a call in the office: your grandma just died.
Well, Timmy. I just don't know what to do with you. You're getting very poor marks in school and the teachers are complaining that you aren't paying attention.
Eric, I've had a lot of complaints that your online persona is becoming a distraction.
Well, you boys have certainly done it this time!
Ooookay students, um, obviously we've had a little emergency with your teacher, so uh, while we deal with this, we need one of you to lead the class and review for tomorrow's quiz.
I was diagnosed seven years ago. Cancer is... pure evil. It is a fat little lump that needs to be... destroyed.  When there is a cancer, you have to "fight" it. You can't reason with cancer, you can't wish it away. Cancer doesn't play by the rules, so neither can you.
And you can't listen to what anybody else tells you.  You have to be willing to give up everything, because the cancer will  take everything. Do you understand?
But this isn't a hurting confused child we're talking about. It's Eric Cartman.
Eric, it has been almost one year since Corey Duran defecated in his pants here in school. Now, you remember what happened to him?
Right, so the issue, as you all know, is that Butters set fire to the gymnasium last week and ran away laughing and flipping everyone off.
Kyle, these men have apparently come all the way from Israel to speak with me, but... we need a translator.
Yes, Mr. Garrison. Have a seat.  Mr. Garrison, sometime ago you asked to be promoted from teaching kindergarten back to the third grade.
Hello there, children. Ooh, love the Elvis costume, Chef.
Eric, we've been informed by a concerned student that you are writing naughty books about one of the girls here at the school.
You can appeal to the city council, but I don't think it'll do any good. Your son must leave South Park, never to return.
-but just make sure that this new little trend doesn't become a distraction. 
All right, we're going to bring Eric in now, and let's all be as supportive as we can and show him lots of love, okay?
But you started it. Mr. Broflovski, tell him what you told us.
Oh, this new fourth-grade teacher is driving me nuts!
Oh. I'm sorry, we don't hire gay people. 
Eric Cartman, report to the principal's office immediately.
