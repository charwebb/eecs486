Okay, Eric, you got what you wanted. Are we straight?
As you know, the position of Fourth Grade teacher has become available, and we'd like to offer YOU the job.
But this isn't a hurting confused child we're talking about. It's Eric Cartman.
Oookay, but you probably understand that for Pete, it isn't that funny. For him it's embarrassing and terrifying.
Ah, Ms. Choksondik, can we have a quick word with you?
Aaand, let me just make a few quickie alterations, and there ya go, young man. 
I'm sorry Mr. Garrison, but it's obvious you aren't tolerant of your own behavior.
Well, I guess that's the grown-up way to put it, yes.
Yes, we apologize for Eric Cartman's behavior, Mr. Nelson. We feel terrible.
Children, I have some difficult news for you. Mr. Garrison won't be teaching for a while. He has to have surgery.  So you're going to have a substitute teacher.  And I want you to show the substitute the same respect you show for Mr. Garrison.  Yes, little boy?
Oh. I'm sorry, we don't hire gay people. 
So did you ever think of just, you know, having it cut off?
I told you the students would be interested in how much they grew since their last physical.
Okay, parents. I know a lot of you want a chance to speak, but we have to talk one at a time.
J-Lo, can we get a picture of you with the kids?
I see.  I've noticed all the things you've done for Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Did you know I'm a breast cancer survivor?
Wendy Testaburger to the principal's office please? Wendy Testaburger to the principal's office.
If Pete Melman does not kill himself,  we will make it very worth your while.
Wait. Are you talking about the numbers we published Tuesday from the physical?
Boys and girls, can I have your attention, please? This year we have a very special guest performing the South Park Elementary Bay Of Pigs Memorial Dance. He was a musical force in the '70's and '80's. Please welcome Ronnie James Dio! 
Ooohh, yeess, a Conjoined Twin Myslexia Awareness Week. You know, that has a nice ring.
Did you infect Kyle with the HIV virus, yes or no?!
Well, not any more than any other student.
Mr. Mackey, so far the school has spent  $22,000 on the IntelliLink system, and so far it's been an unmitigated disaster.
We were wrong for shunning you, Mr. Mackey, and we apologize. We should have realized that you needed help.
I'm sorry Erica, but I spoke with Wendyl this morning and she's not comfortable-
All right, students, members of the school board. Our last speaker will discuss the important role of Latinos in the arts. Here is... Eric Cartman.  Eric Cartman? 
Now, you did say she has a fetus on her head?
With all the new laws we could never fire you for being gay now. You'd be able to sue us for millions of dollars.
Now, we realize this issue can have a troubling effect that can get blown out of proportion.
Oh, looks like the weather might turn shitty.
Okay, thank you very much. Yes, you can pick him up tonight. Bye now.  Now boys, I hope you've learned your lesson.
Eric, I've had a lot of complaints that your online persona is becoming a distraction.
The school board has decided to discontinue the wrestling program. Wrestling simply involves too much adult subject matter, like murder and abortion. 
No, we're sending Chef to a tolerance seminar.
No, it's just that the announcements need to be quick so the students can get on with their work.
And so apparently there's been a little mixup. The manatees were meant to go to the Denver Shelter Aquarium and the frogs were meant to come here.
Well, you boys have certainly done it this time!
This story hasn't gone up on Eavesdropper yet. Maybe it won't!
...Oh. Anywho, I want you all to meet your new substitute, Ms. Ellen. 
Very well. But there is to be no more throwing of feces. Understood??
No, no, I think I have a better idea.
Uhh, who, who else would like to be teacher for the day? Anybody else? 
But he could be anywhere up high in those mountains.
It's okay, Eric. We all understand and we think you're very brave.
Well, how about we make you a new costume. Let's see now.  Aha, thought of something. How about we make you a nice scary ghost costume?
Eric, we've called you in to commend you for your role as student teacher.
Hello there, children. Ooh, love the Elvis costume, Chef.
Kyle, these men have apparently come all the way from Israel to speak with me, but... we need a translator.
Yes, we need to go over it again in the classroom so they understand what really happened.
I understand it's been difficult, Mrs. Garrison, and so, Mr. Donaldson has come from the Tourette's Tolerance and Understanding Foundation. 
Luckily for us, one of you had enough of a conscience to come forward.
All right, all right, I killed him. I hit him over the head and I cut up the body. I tried to burn him, but it wouldn't burn! Oh, the smell of it! I put the legs in garbage bags and hid the torso under a bridge. I HAD TO DO IT!!  OH GOD!!!
Well, whatever happened to him happened at the planetarium.
Well, that does it! I'm suspending you, Timmy, until you can learn to respect your elders! 
I think tonight the planetarium is doing Laser Loggins. I might have to check it out.
Well, you have to admit he does look a little better.
Sir, if you don't wish your daughter to learn about evolution, then we can pull her out of class.
That's wasn't the point, Eric! Nobody was supposed to kill themselves! Unless you fix this our deal is off!
Miss Stevenson, I will need to inform the police.
Well, Mrs. Broflovski, it certainly is a thrill seeing your cheery face again. What seems to be pissing you off today?
Now, kids, I understand that you are very into this "vampire" thing, but I don't want to see it get out of hand. You kids need to understand that your new little fad is scary to some.
Stan Marsh, to the principal's office. Stan Marsh to the principal's office immediately!
After leading your class through review, your schoolmates scored higher than they ever had on their tests. Whatever you did really worked on them.
Attention, students. Don't forget that this Friday night is the South Park Elementary Bay Of Pigs Memorial Dance. We will have a very special band performing, so please come early.
But you started it. Mr. Broflovski, tell him what you told us.
Did you say a fetus, sticking out from her head?
Yeah, I swore that if I had to see it one more time, I'd put a bullet in my head.  But luckily I got really stoned before I came.
Ehsooo, I hear that the South Park Cows are playing for the State Finals in dodgeball tonight.
And so it is with great pride that I can announce the student body has elected to get rid of the transgender bathroom, and give any fellow student the right to use the bathroom they feel most comfortable in. 
School policy has been to teach sexual education later. In the fifth grade.
Well, why the hell would you dress up like Evel Knievel?  Anyway, I hope that you kids are-Daagh!  Eric, God bless it, what do you think you're doing?!
And you can't listen to what anybody else tells you.  You have to be willing to give up everything, because the cancer will  take everything. Do you understand?
All right, we're going to bring Eric in now, and let's all be as supportive as we can and show him lots of love, okay?
Eric, it has been almost one year since Corey Duran defecated in his pants here in school. Now, you remember what happened to him?
I can't, I, umm...I'm very busy.  I send my five dollars a month, see? 
All right. Will you people stop barging into my office, please?
Not as sorry as you're going to be when your parents get here! Ah, here they come now. 
What's a bigger story than all the students being made sick?
I am very disappointed in you, young man. You should be ashamed of yourself. What could have possessed you to be so stupid? 
Yes, Mr. Mackey, we're all aware that you're gluten-free now.
Now now, boys' fascination with their genitalia is a natural thing. We... simply need to find a way to help the students understand what they've done.
I know that you aren't really vampires, and I appreciate that you wanna be cool because vampires are the "in" thing right now, but-
Mr. Gar- Mr. Garrison!  Could we speak with you please?
"Ike, I long to feel your arms around me"?? Miss Stevenson, you- you're having a relationship with this student?
You can appeal to the city council, but I don't think it'll do any good. Your son must leave South Park, never to return.
Oh, this new fourth-grade teacher is driving me nuts!
Ooookay students, um, obviously we've had a little emergency with your teacher, so uh, while we deal with this, we need one of you to lead the class and review for tomorrow's quiz.
Well I've been gluten-free for about a day now, and I have to say I feel sooo amazing. I just want to make sure there's food for all of us.
All students are to evacuate the school immediately! 
Right, so the issue, as you all know, is that Butters set fire to the gymnasium last week and ran away laughing and flipping everyone off.
I wanna come clean with you and tell you that back then some of us were uncomfortable with your sexual preferences. It was wrong of us, and I want to make it up to you.
Well, Timmy. I just don't know what to do with you. You're getting very poor marks in school and the teachers are complaining that you aren't paying attention.
That isn't the only reason you're being let go.
Don't listen to them, kids. You have to go to school.
You see that, parents? Your children have refused to come into class since this morning. I'm afraid your son is the leader, Ms. Cartman.  Apparently he's read the entire Bible, and now he's scaring the hell out of everyone.
I'm sorry, but your son is distracting the other students and his attitude is just getting worse.
I was diagnosed seven years ago. Cancer is... pure evil. It is a fat little lump that needs to be... destroyed.  When there is a cancer, you have to "fight" it. You can't reason with cancer, you can't wish it away. Cancer doesn't play by the rules, so neither can you.
You are to sit in class and help Mr. Dawkins with whatever he needs!
Ooohh, so I suppose that's out. Uh-how about a hat, then?
We in administration see now that you are an individual with your own preferences, and we respect that.
That's better. And now Kyle, maybe you should also admit you were wrong for tattling.
Mrs. Garrison, evolution is in the school curriculum. We have to teach it.
You'd better brace yourself, parents. The boys were caught... smoking!
Teachers, I have some bad news. Last night I received a phone call from the local pharmacist. Apparently, almost all of our fourth graders are sexually active. And now that we've scared them a little they're buying condoms to use.
Alright Eric, here's the deal: This school cannot have another suicide on its hands. We want you to see Pete Melman through this, and turn public opinion around.
I'm afraid that's impossible. Nobody's seen Mr. Garrison since the last school year ended.
Yes, will there be gluten-free options for people at this party?
You are not transgender, Eric! You don't even know what that means!
-but just make sure that this new little trend doesn't become a distraction. 
We thought it would be fun to put up how much each student has grown in height since their physical last year. You grew 1.2 inches.
All we ask is you keep it shorter.
If anyone doesn't, you have the authority to bring them to me.
You sure this will work, Eric? What if some of the students don't eat the pizza?
Eric Cartman, report to the principal's office immediately.
Well, I was just saying that the policies have really changed. You know, we fire you for acting gay next time, you'd be able to sue the school district for ...lots of money.
I'm sorry, the board has made up their minds.
Listen Eric! You must know why we can't have you in the girls bathroom!
But how old do you think a student should be when they learn about proper condom use?
That's right. I think you owe Kyle an apology.
Oh. Well, there was the case out in Minnesota where the guy was awarded... 25 million, I think.
No, I'm afraid it's worse than that. By county law I'm bound to enforce the harshest punishment possible.
Eric, the reason we called you in here is because it is your turn to be the school hallway monitor. 
Is that true, Eric? Did you give Kyle AIDS?
Yes, Mr. Garrison. Have a seat.  Mr. Garrison, sometime ago you asked to be promoted from teaching kindergarten back to the third grade.
I was just telling your friends about what I expect of your-
Students and faculty, please put your hands together and help me in welcoming back, Mister Garrison. 
Wendy, I've been hearing rumors about a fight between you and Eric Cartman.
Now hold on a minute, I think we're being a little drastic here. You know, I probably see a boy in my office once a week for farting on a girl. 
Why did you measure all the boy students' penis sizes and put the results on the school bulletin board?!
All right, all right, fine. Eric, you lead the class.
I just wanted to give you an opportunity to apologize to Mr. Garrison before I send you away, Chef.
Really? Mwell I might just give this gluten-free thing a try. How does it work?
The numbers we put up were height differentials. 
There, there, now. Maybe this will all blow over someday and we can give you a job as a janitor cleaning up vomit with that pink sawdust stuff.
Now, just lead a review over whatever Mr. Garrison's been teaching you, and I'll be back to check on you shortly.  Well well well. Who's teacher now?  Yeahhh. Who's teacher?!
...The Doctors say that Jenny Simon barely survived the fall. Jumping off the school roof fractured her pelvis.
Stanley, do you have a reason for not using the boys bathroom?
Anyone who has a problem sharing a bathroom with people who might be transgender will have to use the special designated bathroom designed to keep them away from the normal people who don't care.
Oh, and Wendy, I almost forgot, we just got a call in the office: your grandma just died.
But why is Mr. Mackey doing this now?
Our students want to learn, Mrs. Garrison, and they're mature enough to handle anything.
Well, Ms. Makaraqesh, you certainly tried to put one over on us, boy howdy. Take her away!
We-hell, "sorry" isn't going to cut the cheese this time, mister! I'm afraid I'm going to have to suspend you from school.
And just what is going on here, mister?
And then he was accused of trying to solicit sex from a young boy.
Mr. Garrison, last week's charges of attempting to solicit sex from a minor wa-
I'm very sorry, but I'm afraid we have to terminate your employment here at South Park Elementary.
Ah, could you please use a little different terminology?
Well, Miss... Choksondik, those children did fairly well in the third grade.
It has become obvious to me that you don't know enough about evolution to teach it! I'm having you replaced! Mr. Dawkins! 
Good luck, Ms. Ellen. If they get out of control, just use this tear gas, okay. 
Boys, the reason we called you all in is because one of your friends... has a serious illness. Eric Cartman has been diagnosed with HIV.
Mrs. Garrison, I am pulling you out of the classroom.
If it is agreeable to you, Erica, we are going to clear out the janitor's closet and remodel it into a private bathroom just for you! 
Okay, before we get started with this PTA meeting, does anyone have any outstanding issues?
Well, I'll talk to Nurse Gollum, but I'm sure she'll be delighted. Let's say around 8?
Well, my hands are tied. We can no longer have Stan's behavior jeopardizing the other children. He must be removed.
Eric, as you might have heard, a student here in South Park Elementary had an accident in the classroom.
Why would we publish the lengths of our students' private parts?
Very well, Mr. Nelson.  Stacey, go ahead and send in Eric Cartman.  Eric, Mr. Nelson is concerned about how you respond to little people.
Thank you for coming, parents. We called you in because we've had a little incident at the school. The fourth grade boys measured their penises and posted results in the school hallway.
The job is to read what is written on the paper, Eric, not to embellish the way you do.
We had to let them go home, and one of them now has half a lid of Jamaican grass because of you!
In the cheeks, you don't think he looks a little fuller?
I want to know just what makes you think it's okay to go inside the girls bathroom!
These gentlemen from the Denver County School Board have something they want to ask you.
All right, well if you identify yourself as a girl, you must find yourself attracted to boys. Is that right?!
You'll just have to share, Eric. Why can't you understand that?
Then it's decided: no more condom classes in grade school.
