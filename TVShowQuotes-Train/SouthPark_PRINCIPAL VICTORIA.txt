Yeah, I swore that if I had to see it one more time, I'd put a bullet in my head.  But luckily I got really stoned before I came.

All right, all right, fine. Eric, you lead the class.

That's better. And now Kyle, maybe you should also admit you were wrong for tattling.

Eric, we've called you in to commend you for your role as student teacher.

You can't care for this child!

No-o, I never did.

Mrs. Garrison, I am pulling you out of the classroom.

Thursday's no good, we've got choir council.

I want to know just what makes you think it's okay to go inside the girls bathroom!

No, no, we're not bad.

I was diagnosed seven years ago. Cancer is... pure evil. It is a fat little lump that needs to be... destroyed.  When there is a cancer, you have to "fight" it. You can't reason with cancer, you can't wish it away. Cancer doesn't play by the rules, so neither can you.

That's right. Will you stay?

Oh. 

Our students want to learn, Mrs. Garrison, and they're mature enough to handle anything.

After leading your class through review, your schoolmates scored higher than they ever had on their tests. Whatever you did really worked on them.

Yes, Mr. Garrison. Have a seat.  Mr. Garrison, sometime ago you asked to be promoted from teaching kindergarten back to the third grade.

Well, I was just saying that the policies have really changed. You know, we fire you for acting gay next time, you'd be able to sue the school district for ...lots of money.

I'm sorry Erica, but I spoke with Wendyl this morning and she's not comfortable-

All right, all right, I killed him. I hit him over the head and I cut up the body. I tried to burn him, but it wouldn't burn! Oh, the smell of it! I put the legs in garbage bags and hid the torso under a bridge. I HAD TO DO IT!!  OH GOD!!!

Mr. Nelson! 

Ehsooo, I hear that the South Park Cows are playing for the State Finals in dodgeball tonight.

Okay. 

In the cheeks, you don't think he looks a little fuller?

Well, congratulations!

Whattaya think? Too forward? 

You'll thank us later. 

That's right. I think you owe Kyle an apology.

Oh, wow.

Alright Eric, here's the deal: This school cannot have another suicide on its hands. We want you to see Pete Melman through this, and turn public opinion around.

Very well. But there is to be no more throwing of feces. Understood??

It has become obvious to me that you don't know enough about evolution to teach it! I'm having you replaced! Mr. Dawkins! 

And then he was accused of trying to solicit sex from a young boy.

No. Banishment.

Good luck, Ms. Ellen. If they get out of control, just use this tear gas, okay. 

I don't know!

What can we do for him, doctor?

Mr. Garrison, last week's charges of attempting to solicit sex from a minor wa-

All right, well if you identify yourself as a girl, you must find yourself attracted to boys. Is that right?!

It's okay, Eric. We all understand and we think you're very brave.

Waaah! 

Oh, my, what an ungrateful bitch.

We-hell, "sorry" isn't going to cut the cheese this time, mister! I'm afraid I'm going to have to suspend you from school.

You demonstrate a lack of tolerance for Mr. Garrison's behavior. In fact, I believe you used the words "sick queer" to describe his conduct in class?

Well I... we...

Well, not any more than any other student.

I'm very sorry, but I'm afraid we have to terminate your employment here at South Park Elementary.

Any other volunteers, perhaps?

You must remove that costume, immediately!

Because you have an anger problem, Eric!

Ooohh, so I suppose that's out. Uh-how about a hat, then?

Oh, dear God!

We've simply had it with your son, Mr. and Mrs. Marsh. Voting just doesn't appear to be important to him.

"Ike, I long to feel your arms around me"?? Miss Stevenson, you- you're having a relationship with this student?

I'm afraid that's impossible. Nobody's seen Mr. Garrison since the last school year ended.

I'm sorry, the board has made up their minds.

Congratulations. How do you feel?

Well, Timmy. I just don't know what to do with you. You're getting very poor marks in school and the teachers are complaining that you aren't paying attention.

Did you say a fetus, sticking out from her head?

Luckily for us, one of you had enough of a conscience to come forward.

Yeah. How about Saturday at 11:30?

All right, we're going to bring Eric in now, and let's all be as supportive as we can and show him lots of love, okay?

Miss Stevenson, I will need to inform the police.

But you started it. Mr. Broflovski, tell him what you told us.

Ooohh, yeess, a Conjoined Twin Myslexia Awareness Week. You know, that has a nice ring.

We were wrong for shunning you, Mr. Mackey, and we apologize. We should have realized that you needed help.

Ohh, what does he need?

Oh noo!

Hello there, children. Ooh, love the Elvis costume, Chef.

Eric, the reason we called you in here is because it is your turn to be the school hallway monitor. 

Students and faculty, please put your hands together and help me in welcoming back, Mister Garrison. 

Hello, boys.

Oh, this new fourth-grade teacher is driving me nuts!

Children, I have some difficult news for you. Mr. Garrison won't be teaching for a while. He has to have surgery.  So you're going to have a substitute teacher.  And I want you to show the substitute the same respect you show for Mr. Garrison.  Yes, little boy?

Mr. Triscotti, I wasn't aware that-

Eric, we've been informed by a concerned student that you are writing naughty books about one of the girls here at the school.

Mr. Gar- Mr. Garrison!  Could we speak with you please?

Now hold on a minute, I think we're being a little drastic here. You know, I probably see a boy in my office once a week for farting on a girl. 

I believe so, yes. 

We're ruined!

Okay, thank you very much. Yes, you can pick him up tonight. Bye now.  Now boys, I hope you've learned your lesson.

We didn't!

Now, just lead a review over whatever Mr. Garrison's been teaching you, and I'll be back to check on you shortly.  Well well well. Who's teacher now?  Yeahhh. Who's teacher?!

I know you will. 

Well, Miss... Choksondik, those children did fairly well in the third grade.

Wait. Are you talking about the numbers we published Tuesday from the physical?

All right, students, members of the school board. Our last speaker will discuss the important role of Latinos in the arts. Here is... Eric Cartman.  Eric Cartman? 

O-of course you do.

As you know, the position of Fourth Grade teacher has become available, and we'd like to offer YOU the job.

Now, kids, I understand that you are very into this "vampire" thing, but I don't want to see it get out of hand. You kids need to understand that your new little fad is scary to some.

Anyone who has a problem sharing a bathroom with people who might be transgender will have to use the special designated bathroom designed to keep them away from the normal people who don't care.

Oh yes, uh, Mr. Garrison, have a seat

We had to let them go home, and one of them now has half a lid of Jamaican grass because of you!

Well, I guess that's the grown-up way to put it, yes.

...Oh. Anywho, I want you all to meet your new substitute, Ms. Ellen. 

But he could be anywhere up high in those mountains.

Well, you have to admit he does look a little better.

But this isn't a hurting confused child we're talking about. It's Eric Cartman.

That isn't the only reason you're being let go.

Why did you measure all the boy students' penis sizes and put the results on the school bulletin board?!

So you're happy with these changes?

I can't be around every second!

Did you infect Kyle with the HIV virus, yes or no?!

J-Lo, can we get a picture of you with the kids?

Attention, students. Don't forget that this Friday night is the South Park Elementary Bay Of Pigs Memorial Dance. We will have a very special band performing, so please come early.

When you have cancer you fight, because it doesn't matter if you beat it or not. You refuse to let that fat little lump make you feel powerless!

Aaand, let me just make a few quickie alterations, and there ya go, young man. 

Ah, could you please use a little different terminology?

Don't listen to them, kids. You have to go to school.

Yes, will there be gluten-free options for people at this party?

He finally snapped and had a nervous breakdown and... went up into the mountains to live in solitude.

The school board has decided to discontinue the wrestling program. Wrestling simply involves too much adult subject matter, like murder and abortion. 

If anyone doesn't, you have the authority to bring them to me.

And so apparently there's been a little mixup. The manatees were meant to go to the Denver Shelter Aquarium and the frogs were meant to come here.

Well, Ms. Makaraqesh, you certainly tried to put one over on us, boy howdy. Take her away!

Get him out of here!

Well, my hands are tied. We can no longer have Stan's behavior jeopardizing the other children. He must be removed.

Okay, thank you, Kyle Broflovski.

Erica, I believe we have a solution to this little problem.

Eric Cartman, report to the principal's office immediately.

All right. Will you people stop barging into my office, please?

Well I've been gluten-free for about a day now, and I have to say I feel sooo amazing. I just want to make sure there's food for all of us.

Wendy Testaburger to the principal's office please? Wendy Testaburger to the principal's office.

Well, how about we make you a new costume. Let's see now.  Aha, thought of something. How about we make you a nice scary ghost costume?

Ooookay students, um, obviously we've had a little emergency with your teacher, so uh, while we deal with this, we need one of you to lead the class and review for tomorrow's quiz.

This story hasn't gone up on Eavesdropper yet. Maybe it won't!

And you can't listen to what anybody else tells you.  You have to be willing to give up everything, because the cancer will  take everything. Do you understand?

Oh, man, this is boring!

-but just make sure that this new little trend doesn't become a distraction. 

You sure this will work, Eric? What if some of the students don't eat the pizza?

Eric Cartman to the principal's office immediately.

How's it going, coach?

Oh, I can't do Monday.

Very well, Mr. Nelson.  Stacey, go ahead and send in Eric Cartman.  Eric, Mr. Nelson is concerned about how you respond to little people.

Is it true? Jennifer Lopez is here?

Thank you for coming, parents. We called you in because we've had a little incident at the school. The fourth grade boys measured their penises and posted results in the school hallway.

Listen Eric! You must know why we can't have you in the girls bathroom!

With all the new laws we could never fire you for being gay now. You'd be able to sue us for millions of dollars.

Now, do you have any questions?

Then it's decided: no more condom classes in grade school.

Wuh sure thing, fine, bye-bye then. 

You're sorry for what, Eric?

All students are to evacuate the school immediately! 

Oh, and Wendy, I almost forgot, we just got a call in the office: your grandma just died.

I just wanted to give you an opportunity to apologize to Mr. Garrison before I send you away, Chef.

Now, we realize this issue can have a troubling effect that can get blown out of proportion.

The job is to read what is written on the paper, Eric, not to embellish the way you do.

No, I'm afraid it's worse than that. By county law I'm bound to enforce the harshest punishment possible.

Well, why the hell would you dress up like Evel Knievel?  Anyway, I hope that you kids are-Daagh!  Eric, God bless it, what do you think you're doing?!

Wendy, I've been hearing rumors about a fight between you and Eric Cartman.

No, it's just that the announcements need to be quick so the students can get on with their work.

Eric, I've had a lot of complaints that your online persona is becoming a distraction.

Oh, Jesus Christ.

I'm sorry, but your son is distracting the other students and his attitude is just getting worse.

You'll just have to share, Eric. Why can't you understand that?

You see that, parents? Your children have refused to come into class since this morning. I'm afraid your son is the leader, Ms. Cartman.  Apparently he's read the entire Bible, and now he's scaring the hell out of everyone.

Oh? Which one?

Alright, listen Eric!

Oh!

Did you call him a fudge packer?

It was an error of judgment, Mr. Mackey, but I'm afraid I have to let you go for it. We searched each one of those kids, but came up empty.

We thought it would be fun to put up how much each student has grown in height since their physical last year. You grew 1.2 inches.

Sshh! Oh, God bless America.  You get into my office before anyone else sees you. I have to show you an educational video.

Because he can't!

Watch the video Eric. 

Ah, Ms. Choksondik, can we have a quick word with you?

Not as sorry as you're going to be when your parents get here! Ah, here they come now. 

If Pete Melman does not kill himself,  we will make it very worth your while.

This is unbelievable.

There, there, now. Maybe this will all blow over someday and we can give you a job as a janitor cleaning up vomit with that pink sawdust stuff.

Mr. Garrison, for the love of God.

Ooookay, thank you, cheerleaders. That was very nice. Ahhh, next we have a student who would like to perform an original rap song,  based on his award-winning poem, "I Was Not The Bullet," with backup music by Butters Stotch. 

You are to sit in class and help Mr. Dawkins with whatever he needs!

I told you the students would be interested in how much they grew since their last physical.

Oh my goodness!

Thank you for coming, everyone. 

Now now, boys' fascination with their genitalia is a natural thing. We... simply need to find a way to help the students understand what they've done.

Eric, I am talking to YOU!

With the what?!

For what? What did he say, Kyle?

Yes, Mr. Mackey, we're all aware that you're gluten-free now.

Is that true, Eric? Did you give Kyle AIDS?

I guess we have no choice.

You're darn right, Eric!

We in administration see now that you are an individual with your own preferences, and we respect that.

Well, that does it! I'm suspending you, Timmy, until you can learn to respect your elders! 

Now, you did say she has a fetus on her head?

Teachers, I have some bad news. Last night I received a phone call from the local pharmacist. Apparently, almost all of our fourth graders are sexually active. And now that we've scared them a little they're buying condoms to use.

No no no we're not firing you.

The numbers we put up were height differentials. 

And just what is going on here, mister?

Shh! Quiet, students, quiet!

Sir, if you don't wish your daughter to learn about evolution, then we can pull her out of class.

All right, boys, now what is this fighting all about?

...The Doctors say that Jenny Simon barely survived the fall. Jumping off the school roof fractured her pelvis.

No, we're sending Chef to a tolerance seminar.

But how old do you think a student should be when they learn about proper condom use?

I understand it's been difficult, Mrs. Garrison, and so, Mr. Donaldson has come from the Tourette's Tolerance and Understanding Foundation. 

Boys, the reason we called you all in is because one of your friends... has a serious illness. Eric Cartman has been diagnosed with HIV.

Oh, and uh, what disease is that?

I'm sorry Mr. Garrison, but it's obvious you aren't tolerant of your own behavior.

Right, so the issue, as you all know, is that Butters set fire to the gymnasium last week and ran away laughing and flipping everyone off.

What's that?

Well, whatever happened to him happened at the planetarium.

Mr. Mackey, so far the school has spent  $22,000 on the IntelliLink system, and so far it's been an unmitigated disaster.

Stan Marsh, to the principal's office. Stan Marsh to the principal's office immediately!

Oh. Oh, wow! WOWuh! 

Fine.

You can appeal to the city council, but I don't think it'll do any good. Your son must leave South Park, never to return.

Boys, please take a seat.

Oh no? Are you sure?

So did you ever think of just, you know, having it cut off?

Good morning, Eric. 

We... found all the gay porn on your iPhone, Mr. Connors.

What??

What about next Sunday?

I think tonight the planetarium is doing Laser Loggins. I might have to check it out.

That's wasn't the point, Eric! Nobody was supposed to kill themselves! Unless you fix this our deal is off!

Filthy bastard Native American money!

She does?

No.

I wanna come clean with you and tell you that back then some of us were uncomfortable with your sexual preferences. It was wrong of us, and I want to make it up to you.

You'd better brace yourself, parents. The boys were caught... smoking!

And so it is with great pride that I can announce the student body has elected to get rid of the transgender bathroom, and give any fellow student the right to use the bathroom they feel most comfortable in. 

Eric, as you might have heard, a student here in South Park Elementary had an accident in the classroom.

Come on in, Eric. 

Oh. I'm sorry, we don't hire gay people. 

Mr. Garrison to the principal's office, please?

No, no, I think I have a better idea.

Alright, are we sure we're alone?

Well, you boys have certainly done it this time!

Eric, it has been almost one year since Corey Duran defecated in his pants here in school. Now, you remember what happened to him?

I see.  I've noticed all the things you've done for Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Did you know I'm a breast cancer survivor?

Mr. Garrison?

Really? Mwell I might just give this gluten-free thing a try. How does it work?

Well, I'll talk to Nurse Gollum, but I'm sure she'll be delighted. Let's say around 8?

Richard Dawkins is a world-renowned evolutionary scientist.

I am very disappointed in you, young man. You should be ashamed of yourself. What could have possessed you to be so stupid? 

Uhh, who, who else would like to be teacher for the day? Anybody else? 

School policy has been to teach sexual education later. In the fifth grade.

Where did you get that costume, young man?!

Mr. Mackey, Clyde's parents are here.

Oh, oh, haha. Wow.

I thought you were a chick.

Oh, looks like the weather might turn shitty.

Eric, I've had enough! You cannot and you will not sell your books on school grounds! Do I make myself clear?!

Oh. Well, there was the case out in Minnesota where the guy was awarded... 25 million, I think.

Mrs. Garrison, evolution is in the school curriculum. We have to teach it.

As we said before, that's impossible.

Boys and girls, can I have your attention, please? This year we have a very special guest performing the South Park Elementary Bay Of Pigs Memorial Dance. He was a musical force in the '70's and '80's. Please welcome Ronnie James Dio! 

Good.

Okay, Eric, you got what you wanted. Are we straight?

That's insane!

Oh, my! What an exciting day!

You are not transgender, Eric! You don't even know what that means!

What's a bigger story than all the students being made sick?

Would that be agreeable to you?

Mr. Mackey, it's over.

Ah I'm sorry, I really don't understand.

These gentlemen from the Denver County School Board have something they want to ask you.

Kyle, these men have apparently come all the way from Israel to speak with me, but... we need a translator.

Yes, we apologize for Eric Cartman's behavior, Mr. Nelson. We feel terrible.
