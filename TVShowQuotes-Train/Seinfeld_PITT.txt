Well, I think of you as part of my family. You've come to be like a daughter to me and I want to make sure you're taken care of after I'm gone.
Mrs. Landis, there's something wrong with this copying machine, it's all coming out slanted. Now, I don't know if this is your department or not.
No.
Elaine, I want you to come and work for me as my personal assistant. Now, I'll pay you the same as Pendant, but I would need you to start right away.
(Sneezes) Elaine, I feel a cold coming on. Could you get me a cold pill from the medicine cabinet?
No.
This is the girl I want to put in my will. Elaine...
Grace, yes.
It's for you.
I want a decent sock that's comfortable, that will stay on my foot!!
There's no elastic, you need to pull too much (pulls them up more).
They're too tight.
For a while, yes, but not in the long run.
Hello?
But I was hoping for my new socks today!
Some grace, yes.
Ultimately I don't think they'll stay up.
It's good, but...
Elaine, you know what I just did? I just amended my will to include you as a beneficiary.
Elaine!
One second Elaine.
They're cutting off the circulation.
Well, you don't want too much grace or you won't be able to stand.
Okay.
The resemblance is uncanny. (Elaine, sipping soda through a straw, looks up with a sour expression on her face.) Even the brown eyes.
No, I don't like them.
I spoke to someone who worked there.
Tomorrow?
No, there's something else. An indefinable quality.
That's him! That's the man who gave me the pills in the drug store! He's no pharmacist.
You're fired, Elaine. Goodbye.
She tried to smother me with a pillow.
I'm sorry. I must have them today.
