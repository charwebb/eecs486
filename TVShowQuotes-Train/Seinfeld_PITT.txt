I want a decent sock that's comfortable, that will stay on my foot!!
This is the girl I want to put in my will. Elaine...
Elaine, I want you to come and work for me as my personal assistant. Now, I'll pay you the same as Pendant, but I would need you to start right away.
She tried to smother me with a pillow.
Oh, forget about those! (Takes the socks from Elaine and throws them on the floor.) Why do you keep mentioning those?
(Sneezes) Elaine, I feel a cold coming on. Could you get me a cold pill from the medicine cabinet?
But I was hoping for my new socks today!
The resemblance is uncanny. (Elaine, sipping soda through a straw, looks up with a sour expression on her face.) Even the brown eyes.
For a while, yes, but not in the long run.
Well, you don't want too much grace or you won't be able to stand.
Well, I think of you as part of my family. You've come to be like a daughter to me and I want to make sure you're taken care of after I'm gone.
Mrs. Landis, there's something wrong with this copying machine, it's all coming out slanted. Now, I don't know if this is your department or not.
Elaine, you know what I just did? I just amended my will to include you as a beneficiary.
There's no elastic, you need to pull too much (pulls them up more).
