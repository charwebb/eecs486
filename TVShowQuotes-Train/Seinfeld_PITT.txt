Well, I think of you as part of my family. You've come to be like a daughter to me and I want to make sure you're taken care of after I'm gone.
They're cutting off the circulation.
I spoke to someone who worked there.
Grace, yes.
Okay.
It's for you.
Yes, yes, I'll check with the pharmacist.
Charmed.
Well, you don't want too much grace or you won't be able to stand.
She tried to smother me with a pillow.
Elaine!
Mrs. Landis, there's something wrong with this copying machine, it's all coming out slanted. Now, I don't know if this is your department or not.
No, there's something else. An indefinable quality.
It's good, but...
Elaine, you know what I just did? I just amended my will to include you as a beneficiary.
I'm sorry. I must have them today.
I want a decent sock that's comfortable, that will stay on my foot!!
Some grace, yes.
No.
Ultimately I don't think they'll stay up.
No.
Hello?
The resemblance is uncanny. (Elaine, sipping soda through a straw, looks up with a sour expression on her face.) Even the brown eyes.
But I was hoping for my new socks today!
There's no elastic, you need to pull too much (pulls them up more).
Elaine, I want you to come and work for me as my personal assistant. Now, I'll pay you the same as Pendant, but I would need you to start right away.
For a while, yes, but not in the long run.
That's him! That's the man who gave me the pills in the drug store! He's no pharmacist.
(Sneezes) Elaine, I feel a cold coming on. Could you get me a cold pill from the medicine cabinet?
This is the girl I want to put in my will. Elaine...
Tomorrow?
One second Elaine.
You're fired, Elaine. Goodbye.
