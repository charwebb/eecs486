Ultimately I don't think they'll stay up.
I want a decent sock that's comfortable, that will stay on my foot!!
Elaine!
This is the girl I want to put in my will. Elaine...
Grace, yes.
No.
Elaine, you know what I just did? I just amended my will to include you as a beneficiary.
Well, you don't want too much grace or you won't be able to stand.
(Sneezes) Elaine, I feel a cold coming on. Could you get me a cold pill from the medicine cabinet?
No.
Well, I think of you as part of my family. You've come to be like a daughter to me and I want to make sure you're taken care of after I'm gone.
There's no elastic, you need to pull too much (pulls them up more).
But I was hoping for my new socks today!
Okay.
One second Elaine.
Hello?
I'm sorry. I must have them today.
They're too tight.
Elaine, I want you to come and work for me as my personal assistant. Now, I'll pay you the same as Pendant, but I would need you to start right away.
They're cutting off the circulation.
I spoke to someone who worked there.
Charmed.
It's for you.
The resemblance is uncanny. (Elaine, sipping soda through a straw, looks up with a sour expression on her face.) Even the brown eyes.
Yes, yes, I'll check with the pharmacist.
Oh, forget about those! (Takes the socks from Elaine and throws them on the floor.) Why do you keep mentioning those?
No, there's something else. An indefinable quality.
It's good, but...
Some grace, yes.
Tomorrow?
No, I don't like them.
That's him! That's the man who gave me the pills in the drug store! He's no pharmacist.
You're fired, Elaine. Goodbye.
