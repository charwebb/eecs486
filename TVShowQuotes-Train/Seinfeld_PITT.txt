But I was hoping for my new socks today!
Okay.
Charmed.
Some grace, yes.
For a while, yes, but not in the long run.
They're too tight.
Ultimately I don't think they'll stay up.
No.
Grace, yes.
This is the girl I want to put in my will. Elaine...
That's him! That's the man who gave me the pills in the drug store! He's no pharmacist.
Elaine, I want you to come and work for me as my personal assistant. Now, I'll pay you the same as Pendant, but I would need you to start right away.
Oh, forget about those! (Takes the socks from Elaine and throws them on the floor.) Why do you keep mentioning those?
No, I don't like them.
One second Elaine.
Elaine!
Well, I think of you as part of my family. You've come to be like a daughter to me and I want to make sure you're taken care of after I'm gone.
(Sneezes) Elaine, I feel a cold coming on. Could you get me a cold pill from the medicine cabinet?
I want a decent sock that's comfortable, that will stay on my foot!!
She tried to smother me with a pillow.
Hello?
Mrs. Landis, there's something wrong with this copying machine, it's all coming out slanted. Now, I don't know if this is your department or not.
The resemblance is uncanny. (Elaine, sipping soda through a straw, looks up with a sour expression on her face.) Even the brown eyes.
You're fired, Elaine. Goodbye.
I'm sorry. I must have them today.
It's good, but...
It's for you.
Tomorrow?
Elaine, you know what I just did? I just amended my will to include you as a beneficiary.
I spoke to someone who worked there.
No, there's something else. An indefinable quality.
There's no elastic, you need to pull too much (pulls them up more).
Yes, yes, I'll check with the pharmacist.
