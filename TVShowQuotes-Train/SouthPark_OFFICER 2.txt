Just have a seat in there, kids. 

That's right. Come on, bring it!

Right. The thing that I jacked off to was you! Huh!Â 

Your son is at the Bowery Building threatening to kill himself.

Some kid must have said it wasn't the real Mr. Hankey again. 

He's supposed to be some kind of psychic.

Sir, it's possible with the crane we could help any survivors out.

The Monster Mash is only on Halloween. 

Oh, but, but she's ugly, right?

Or perhaps a forest ranger?

Ms. Claridge, did Trent Boyett do this to you.  Yes, yes. Take him away!

Well maybe someone else on your planet knows where it is?

We've got a chance. Hostages are clear! 

Hey Murphy, think they'll let me borrow their G.I. Joes?

Hostages are secure at the park entrance!

Yeah! Who the hell are you to say that?!

Whenever a civilization discovers warp speed, we want to bring them into the Federation of Planets, but first we do the space cash test, to see if that species is worthy of joining.

I play the banjo too.

I'm afraid it's about to get worse. You see this area here? This is where we're setting up the stage for Bon Jovi.

Oh my God, what have we done?

Shut up, Romanians! All right, let's go. Move move move move! 

These are good cops! We can't have them standing around for hours without some entertainment! The problem is, with this area blocked by napping tents, we have no place to serve the officers beer.

Right.  Thank you! 

Keep blowing. Keep blowing.  Keep blowing.  Aw Jesus!

Yeeah!

They got 'em. It's over.

Hey! Get down to State Street! They're occupying Macaroni Grill!

Find them!

The hostages are clear!

Oh my God. Are those what I think they are?

You mind if we search your room?

So, Trent, you just had to finish off your old preschool teacher, eh?

It appears to have been... destroyed.

We'll get right on it, Mysterion. Thank you. Thank you for all your help.  Godspeed, Mysterion!

Mr. and Mrs. Weatherhead, we have the new foster kids for your care. 

It's no drill, sir. The Russians are saying their missiles are going online as well and it isn't their doing.

Stop right now! It's over! 

They're lying.

This is John and Patsy Ramsey, from Boulder.
