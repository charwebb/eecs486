Then why are they refusing to write? I agreed to show Mohammad uncensored! I did what you asked! WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME??!!
Mr. President, there's something about the Family Guy writing staff I think you should know. 
Hold on, Julie!  What are you talking about, kid?
But, nobody took any idea balls out of the tank, did they?
You mean... the manatees aren't trying to run the network?
I can't be responsible for people getting hurt. Especially me.
Little boy, will you talk to the Family Guy writing staff? If your story touches their hearts like it has ours, perhaps they'll back down from demanding we air the episode.
I don't understand it. What's wrong with them? 
How about I allow the episode to air but, just censor out the image of Mohammad again.
I'm sure. Begin episode jettison sequence 0 2 900. 
Mr. President, my hands are tied. The Family Guy writers insist I don't censor Mohammad.
I feel terrible. It's so east to put terrorism out of mind until one of its victims is staring you in the face.
Mr. President, there's something about the Family Guy writing staff I think you should know. 
You're right. It's time I stop letting these primadonna manatees tell me what to do! I'm pulling the Mohammad episode, you got that?! And if you all don't want to work tomorrow, you can just find other jobs!!  How long before Family Guy's supposed to air?!
Family Guy is our biggest show. If they insist we don't censor their work, then we we can't.
I shouldn't even be in the office still. It's supposed to be half-day Friday.
Take this noble child over to the Family Guy offices. If he can scare them like he has us, maybe we can pull the Mohammad episode after all.
Family Guy goes on air as planned. Uncensored.
