Ah... I don't know who to listen to!
Mr. President, there's something about the Family Guy writing staff I think you should know. 
Hold on, Julie!  What are you talking about, kid?
Network Control! This is the President! I want you to pull the episode.
Little boy, will you talk to the Family Guy writing staff? If your story touches their hearts like it has ours, perhaps they'll back down from demanding we air the episode.
Then why are they refusing to write? I agreed to show Mohammad uncensored! I did what you asked! WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME??!!
Family Guy goes on air as planned. Uncensored.
I'm sure. Begin episode jettison sequence 0 2 900. 
Take this noble child over to the Family Guy offices. If he can scare them like he has us, maybe we can pull the Mohammad episode after all.
You mean... the manatees aren't trying to run the network?
How about I allow the episode to air but, just censor out the image of Mohammad again.
I feel terrible. It's so east to put terrorism out of mind until one of its victims is staring you in the face.
I can't be responsible for people getting hurt. Especially me.
Mr. President, there's something about the Family Guy writing staff I think you should know. 
I don't understand it. What's wrong with them? 
Family Guy is our biggest show. If they insist we don't censor their work, then we we can't.
Mr. President, my hands are tied. The Family Guy writers insist I don't censor Mohammad.
But, nobody took any idea balls out of the tank, did they?
