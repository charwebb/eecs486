Ms. Cartman, uh- eight years old is a little late to be considering abortion.
They went that way.  Look out! They have bear mace!
... yes, I see.  Uh, but the child on the milk carton was reported missing, not found.
Hmmmmm. Tsk, I'm afraid I can't help you, Ms. Cartman. If you want to change the law, you'll have to speak with your congressman.
...Thompson. Uh, I'll contact the young boy who gave me the photo, and perhaps we can all visit him together.
Yes, this is what we would refer to as the "fortieth trimester".
Mr. and Mrs. Thompson, how long has it been since you've seen your son?
Do you keep any record of the men getting these "kisses"?
Oh Larry! This young man has some new fetuses for research.
Uoh well, we can do that. This must be a very difficult time for you, Mrs...
So... do you have heads down where your rear ends should be?
And exactly what kind of business are you running?
Sir? Sir, do you remember the kids from that South Park Elementary School?
Third cubicle on the left  Hey! Aren't you that cute little kid from Jerry Maguire?
Oh, of course. Printing those photos on our milk really does help. Do you have the photo with you?
I don't see you on the list, Mr. Clinton.
Wuh... But we prefer to abort babies a little- ...earlier on; in fact, there's a law against abortions after the second trimester.
Well you just give us a try. I think you'll find that South Park Milk  is not only the best resource for finding kids,  but also the best producer of the freshest 2% lowfat milk the world can offer. 
They're all protesting outside, saying our system isn't fair to the 99% of them.
Welcome to South Park Milk Company. Can I help you?
Oooo, I watch that show all the time. 
Please, Mrs. Thompson, it'll be alright.  Listen, the South Park Dairy Company is the country's largest. We find lost children all the time.  We can help you find Tommy with the company's database!
Oh, right, the fetuses. We were very lucky you called. Our last shipment of fetuses was lost in a truck accident.
Who does? Nobody likes what the Wall-Mart does, but it keeps... right on doing it.
Hello and welcome to Steinburg & Burgstein. Can I help you?
O...kay, but if you've got a problem with Family Guy, you'll have to wait in line.  That little boy over there has an appointment to try and get Family Guy off the air altogether. 
Sure. If I could get a description of the child to print underneath the photo? 
Mr. Thompson, how did your son become missing? Was he abducted?
