Who does? Nobody likes what the Wall-Mart does, but it keeps... right on doing it.

... yes, I see.  Uh, but the child on the milk carton was reported missing, not found.

...Full cheeks...

Mr. and Mrs. Thompson, how long has it been since you've seen your son?

Well you just give us a try. I think you'll find that South Park Milk  is not only the best resource for finding kids,  but also the best producer of the freshest 2% lowfat milk the world can offer. 

Yes, Ms. Cartman. If you don't feel fit to raise a child, then abortion probably is the answer. Do you know the actual time of conception?

Welcome to South Park Milk Company. Can I help you?

Chef?

Eh no sir.

...Thompson. Uh, I'll contact the young boy who gave me the photo, and perhaps we can all visit him together.

I'm not falling for it!

Oh Larry! This young man has some new fetuses for research.

Do you keep any record of the men getting these "kisses"?

Oh, of course. Printing those photos on our milk really does help. Do you have the photo with you?

Hello and welcome to Steinburg & Burgstein. Can I help you?

Wuh... But we prefer to abort babies a little- ...earlier on; in fact, there's a law against abortions after the second trimester.

And you're making a profit?

Can I help you?

Senator Morris?

And this was back in Wisconsin? 

Where are you visiting from?

Sure. If I could get a description of the child to print underneath the photo? 

Who are you?

And exactly what kind of business are you running?

A ban? Why?

Oh, right, the fetuses. We were very lucky you called. Our last shipment of fetuses was lost in a truck accident.

They went that way.  Look out! They have bear mace!

Sorry Doctor, your wife's on the phone? Says it's an emergency. 

O...kay, but if you've got a problem with Family Guy, you'll have to wait in line.  That little boy over there has an appointment to try and get Family Guy off the air altogether. 

We aren't giving you anything; get out! 

Alright, get out of here! 

Okay, brown eye...

O-okay, great. We'll print it immediately.

Oh! The black guy!

Can I help you sir?

Can I help you?

...Really?

All right, and your name?

They're all protesting outside, saying our system isn't fair to the 99% of them.

O-kay, let me send you into Josh. 

Third cubicle on the left  Hey! Aren't you that cute little kid from Jerry Maguire?

Ms. Cartman, uh- eight years old is a little late to be considering abortion.

Uoh well, we can do that. This must be a very difficult time for you, Mrs...

Yes, this is what we would refer to as the "fortieth trimester".

Can I help you?

Can I help you?

Can I help you?

Well, Mr. and Mrs...

...Riiight.

Hmm, hmm, that's am-, that's amazing.

Well?

I don't see you on the list, Mr. Clinton.

Gentlemen, Ms. Struthers can see you now. 

So... do you have heads down where your rear ends should be?

In charge? I guess that would be Harvey Brown. He's the current president of Wall-Mart. One of the original creators.

Hmmmmm. Tsk, I'm afraid I can't help you, Ms. Cartman. If you want to change the law, you'll have to speak with your congressman.

Can I help you?

Oooo, I watch that show all the time. 

Wow! You really got fat.
