Yes, Ms. Cartman. If you don't feel fit to raise a child, then abortion probably is the answer. Do you know the actual time of conception?

Well you just give us a try. I think you'll find that South Park Milk  is not only the best resource for finding kids,  but also the best producer of the freshest 2% lowfat milk the world can offer. 

So... do you have heads down where your rear ends should be?

I'm not falling for it!

Chef?

In charge? I guess that would be Harvey Brown. He's the current president of Wall-Mart. One of the original creators.

All right, and your name?

They're all protesting outside, saying our system isn't fair to the 99% of them.

Sir? Sir, do you remember the kids from that South Park Elementary School?

Do you keep any record of the men getting these "kisses"?

Hello and welcome to Steinburg & Burgstein. Can I help you?

We aren't giving you anything; get out! 

And exactly what kind of business are you running?

Alright, get out of here! 

Well?

Can I help you sir?

Sorry Doctor, your wife's on the phone? Says it's an emergency. 

O-kay, let me send you into Josh. 

Mr. Thompson, how did your son become missing? Was he abducted?

And you're making a profit?

O-okay, great. We'll print it immediately.

Okay, brown eye...

... yes, I see.  Uh, but the child on the milk carton was reported missing, not found.

Hmm, hmm, that's am-, that's amazing.

Can I help you?

Sure. If I could get a description of the child to print underneath the photo? 

Mr. and Mrs. Thompson, how long has it been since you've seen your son?

What is it regarding?

...Thompson. Uh, I'll contact the young boy who gave me the photo, and perhaps we can all visit him together.

Can I help you?

Wow! You really got fat.

Third cubicle on the left  Hey! Aren't you that cute little kid from Jerry Maguire?

Where?

Can I help you?

Who does? Nobody likes what the Wall-Mart does, but it keeps... right on doing it.

A ban? Why?

Please, Mrs. Thompson, it'll be alright.  Listen, the South Park Dairy Company is the country's largest. We find lost children all the time.  We can help you find Tommy with the company's database!

They went that way.  Look out! They have bear mace!

I don't see you on the list, Mr. Clinton.

Can I help you?

Ms. Cartman, uh- eight years old is a little late to be considering abortion.

Oooo, I watch that show all the time. 

...I sseee, so the fetus is...

...Really?

Oh! The black guy!

Yes, this is what we would refer to as the "fortieth trimester".

Hmmmmm. Tsk, I'm afraid I can't help you, Ms. Cartman. If you want to change the law, you'll have to speak with your congressman.

...Full cheeks...

Where are you visiting from?

Wuh... But we prefer to abort babies a little- ...earlier on; in fact, there's a law against abortions after the second trimester.

Senator Morris?

Oh Larry! This young man has some new fetuses for research.

Uoh well, we can do that. This must be a very difficult time for you, Mrs...

And this was back in Wisconsin? 

Well, Mr. and Mrs...

Eh no sir.

Gentlemen, Ms. Struthers can see you now. 

Welcome to South Park Milk Company. Can I help you?

...Riiight.
