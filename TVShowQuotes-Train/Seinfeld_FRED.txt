Sorry about the other night but my mother called, she couldn't find her pills. I had to go into Brooklyn to help her find her pills, and they were right there in the medicine cabinet. Could you believe that?
...I could have taken a cab but if my mother saw me pull up in a cab, she'd start yelling at me, "Freddy! What are taking a cab for? It's so expensive!" She's out of her mind. Eventually, you'll meet her.
I'm depressed. I got this new shirt, the button fell off. Once the button falls off, that's it. I'll never fix it.

The bathroom door. I remember someone had played tic-tac-toe on it, and the X's won; they went diagonally from the top left to the bottom right.

Oh, we only wake you up for the important meetings.
You're lucky, at least you got something to do.
Oh no. That's why we're here. We're checking things out.
Yeah, its fate, you know, can't avoid your fate.
No, it's nice to meet you. Well, I'm outta here, see you guys.
Paul, woman here claims there's a restaurant on the West side that's only hiring large-breasted women.
