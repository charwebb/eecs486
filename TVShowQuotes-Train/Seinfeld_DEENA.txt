George, this is the best thing for you. (she walks away)
So again it all comes back to Lloyd.
I thought you heard. He had a nervous breakdown last year. That's why I'm taking care of him.
And I suppose Lloyd Braun had something to do with it too.
So, you want my father to pay for this?
I don't know, George. I don't know what to believe.
Yet again, taking pleasure in the misfortunes of others.
Sorry I can't be so flip about this kind of thing. You know, after what happened to Pop.
I'm... I'm concerned. George? George, are you listening to me?
You're probably wondering why I wanted to see you again.
So, your car caught fire because of my father and the woman on the horse?
I'm glad you feel that way. Because since my father's breakdown I uh, become very sensitive to the warning signs.
