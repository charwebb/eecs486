You're probably wondering why I wanted to see you again.
Yet again, taking pleasure in the misfortunes of others.
I'll be back same time next week, Pop.
I'm glad you feel that way. Because since my father's breakdown I uh, become very sensitive to the warning signs.
Sorry I can't be so flip about this kind of thing. You know, after what happened to Pop.
So again it all comes back to Lloyd.
And I suppose Lloyd Braun had something to do with it too.
George, this is the best thing for you. (she walks away)
So, your car caught fire because of my father and the woman on the horse?
I don't know, George. I don't know what to believe.
I'm... I'm concerned. George? George, are you listening to me?
I thought you heard. He had a nervous breakdown last year. That's why I'm taking care of him.
