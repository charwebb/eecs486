It is amazing what people can do under stress. Just look at the pyramids. Nobody knows how they built those, or who.
Okay, that's enough o' that! You cows need to dis-perse!  All right, bad cows! Do you hear me? Bad cows!  All right, Ned. You're gonna have to bust out the whip!
Chef, I respect you very much, but you have to understand that this has been the South Park flag since some of our ancestors, like my great-grandfather, founded this land!
Would this be for hunting, home protection, or other?
Aw, he'll be fine. I'll just take him home and show him some good hard-core porn, he'll snap right out of it. Won't you, Ned? 
Uh Professor, we all just thought of somethin'. If everyone has their head buried by the person standing to their left, then who's gonna bury the last person's head?
Hold onto your butts.  Take that, you demon frog!  Ned, Ned? Can you hear me?  Quick! Somebody, call an ambulance! This man is catatonic!
Yeah. How many rich people does it take to screw in a light bulb? None! They can hire people to do it for them! 
Calm down, soldier! We need every person here to keep his head! Barbrady, fetch some straws.
Don't y'all worry, you just wait till halftime, hehe.
Because Cotswolds is gonna to live there. And when he shows up, we all grab him, bring him out here, and duct-tape him to the flagpole!
Yeah, I've been reenacting this war for 22 years now. And for 22 years us Confederate reenactors have had to spend the evening being ridiculed and made fun of by the Union reenactors! Well, I'm sick of it!
W-hell, naturally you could cross the line for that. Just like ...we could cross the line for hardware, supplies, gas, and pharmaceutical needs.
Come on Ned, we gotta get our asses to the bookie.
Tough love, Mr. Mackey. We're taking you to rehab.
I hope so, Mayor. I hope so. Uhud I need a cold beer and a burger.  What's all the ruckus over there? 
..."but Ponyboy was beat up pretty bad. He kept saying, 'stay gold.'"  Aw, Ned. If you can hear me, y-you've got to snap out of it, 'cause if you don't, uh-I'll never forgive myself.  Aw, Stanley, he's gone! My only friend in the world is gone!
We just encourage them to find someplace better.
There there Randy, you... You gave it your best shot.
Damn, Ned, I've never seen that much cash.
Yeah, I just wanted to  try to set an example, you know?
You can do it, kid! You can do it!
Aw, thank God you're alright, kid.  It was an accident, I swear. Uh, is there any way we can make it up to you?
It's him! The Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka. He's right over there on that rock.
Hey, look out son, that's dangerous. You're gonna spill your beer.
I remember I had just gotten off the Ferris wheel.
Listen, everybody. We did what we had to in there.
Welluh, that sounds great. I'm gonna get some s'more schnapps. You want anything?
Aw, nuts! Come on, Ned, this ain't no whore house, it's a hor-ROR house.
Welcome, hunters. Boy, have we got a show for you today! We have just received a tape from another viewer who filmed the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka right here in South Park.
You know what? I'll bet we could take Topeka right now and clear them all around!
Give me some more s'more schnapps! I'm gonna be sick.  Blouach.
Stay out of this, Gerald! Some men care about what their wives are doing!
I'm also very proud to announce that this year's alcohol sponsor, Jagermin's S'more-flavored Schnapps, the schnapps with the delightful taste of s'mores.
Give 'em hell Stanley!  Jesus, now I haven't asked you for much, but all we need is one little score. Please? Please, Jesus?
Come on everybody, let's do the Drunken Barn Dance! 
Alright, Ned. Now we're coming up to the American border. They can't know that we have fireworks in the trunk. Just let me do the talking.  I guess that goes without saying, doesn't it? 
Atta boy! Now quick, get him again while he's down! 
Get around th' side there, Ned. I can't get a shot in from here.
Ohho, it's a deer. Looks like about a .46 gauge, Ned. It's coming right for us!  
Aw, why don't you go to a Grateful Dead concert? 
Randy! Randy, you've got to get out of here! If they just trample this park, we'll be trapped! It's too dangerous!
Alrighty everyone.  We're going to do the entire reenactment again, because of some confusion over the bell. Now, I know you're just trying to help Eric, but we have to let the Union capture the bell this time.
Well boys, I'm sorry I got you all killed. 
All right, looks like we'll have to apply the Oppenheimer technique with Tweek here. 
You boys don't understand. Ned was so freaked out by the idea of the Mexican staring frog that he must have sent himself into a deep coma.
There's a murderer free in South Park. We have to find out who it is before they kill again.
We're all with you, Jesus! We put every dime we have on you beatin' that Dark Prince. 
How do you tell him? "Hey Gerald, Sorry, but the UPS man is bangin' your wife." It's really none of our business.
Come on! We gotta buy more duct tape.
Wait, there's a ram! It's coming right for us!  Nice shootin' Kenny. Here, you need a bigger gun.
Yeah, it's almost like something funny's going on.  Christ, Ned, what'd you have for breakfast.
Ned, look.  They've got Enrique on their sideline, and it looks like that bomb's still attached.
Well, enough of the lectures. let's get to boxing. 
How come you're not blowin' things up? It's summer.
Quick, Ned! This is our chance! The Hummer's outside!
What the hell are you talking about, you don't want to shoot the bunny? You're babbling, you're not making any sense, you're hysterical.
Dear God, they're bigger than I ever imagined!
Well, son, I think you have a pretty stupid plan there.
Hey, now that's not true. My shoes don't say I pound butt.
Well, Jesus, I definitely learned my lesson. Neeever bet on evil, 'cause when you d- Ned! Look, there's a rare duck-billed platypus!  Ih-it's comin' right for us! 
Well, we can all be friends now.  Come on, Randy. Have some s'more schnapps. 
Oh, why can't we all live at the mall?!
The kindergarten teacher is suspected of having sex with a student
Huh? Uh hey now, uh. We don't want your support. We're not racists; this is about history.
Hey. Where's she going? That's the wrong way, you stupid cow! 
I uh... Well, okay, I might have embellished the truth a little, but that's different.
We have to take 'em out, Ned! At all costs! Die, you red commie bastards! 
You hear that, cows? You're surrounded! There's no way out!
Well, it appears as though a lot of you "skeptics" thought that the film we showed of the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka was a fake. That you say it didn't harm anybody. Well, it just so happens that we just received another film from another anonymous viewer.  Roll it!  There you go! Proof that not only is this frog real, but it is doing harm to the people of South Park as we speak!
Shhh, not so loud. Now that there's just a technicality.
Hi, I'm Jimbo Kern, and this here is Ned. Say hi, Ned.
Well, Ned, looks like we missed Fourth of July again.
Now boys, boys, ah-I need to get serious for a minute. I want you to understand a few basic rules of hunting, since this is your first time. First, don't ever walk with your gun unless the safety's on. Second, don't shoot anything that looks human, and third, never spill your beer in the bullet chamber.
Oh, lookie who's here. My little nephew Stanley.  So, you're interested in your Uncle Jimbo's big TV show, huh?
How come they just let that Bono guy send a picture of his crap?
What a beautiful morning for fishing. There's one, there's a fish right there! 
We followed blindly for thousands of years and we think the least God can do is show up for New Year's Eve 1999!
Everyone. Everyone, listen. FOX Network censored the image of Mohammad at the last minute.
See now with a "stand your ground" law, you could legally shoot somebody that's threatening you whether they're in your house or not.
Oh my God!  Well, don't worry boys, Uncle Jimbo is on the case.  Buckle your seat belt, Ned.
And you saw it here, on The Jimbo and Ned Show.
Oh. Well, does Mr. Denkins know you're usin' his pony? He shoots trespassers on sight, you know.
Yeah, I wanted to order that theft alarm for my IT.
Alright, Ned. We've got to be careful. These are really evil men we're dealing with.
Well, that does it! All this week, Ned and I will be--
We'll give the storm another hour. After that, we might have to eat again.
Well, come on, guys. If I'm not mistaken, we still have someone to duct-tape to the flagpole!
I don't have to remind you just how important this game is to us South Park Alumni.
Oho, it was awful!  Cow after cow taking its own life, and we could do nothing to stop them! Oh, God!
This is all Stan's fault! He wrote that gay little song and got us to drive those damned hybrids!
What we'll have to do here Carl is put a trigger on that bomb that makes it go off at a specific moment during halftime.
Yeah, it was like wrestling a Louisiana alligator, this thing. Put up one hell of a fight. 
Oh, hell, I have to run home and get my broom!
Hey Ned, why don't you whip out the ol' cancer kazoo? Let's do a little song.
Well,  we're not going anywhere for a loong time.
Don't do it, Randy. If Muhammad is seen, we could get bombed.
What?!  Is that a challenge?! I'll bet we can!
Here's the same gun, with a wood finish.
Good! Now kick his balls!  There, see? You've got him coughing up blood.
What?! Give me those!  Holy crow, he's right, Ned! Mrs. Tenorman's lettin' the twins out!
Look, we have to accept the fact that most people in the world hate us, right?
I just came from Will Patterson's house! His mother got three packages from Amazon! And the UPS guy told her what he'd like to do to her!
Broflovski, did you put this crap on my windshield?! 
Okay, everybody, okay. Settle down. Now I know you're all anxious to get to the Running of the Cows, BUT, let me remind you: those brave souls who have decided to run against the cows through town do so at their own risk. I don't think I have to remind you that three people died in last year's Running of the Cows.  With that said, let's rock and roll!  Everybody ready to run?  Release the cows!  They're loose! 
Pass me some more cocoa, will you, Ned?
Yeah. You know, uh I suddenly found myself on the side of Klan members. I've never had anything against blacks, Chef.
Buenos dias, mi amigo. Yo soy un Americano espectacularrr.
Come on, Ned! We've got to get our asses to the bookie! 
You see… Ned picked up the grenade and… BOOM, blasted his arm clear off. We spent three hours looking for that damn arm, but it was never to be found. Some say it's still crawling around to this day.
Excuse me, Mayor, but I just received some news that you might all be interested in.  Our South Park Cows have just beaten the Washington dodgeball team, and are on their way to the world championship in China. 
I'm sorry, Stan. I was just trying to tell a good story. I never meant for you boys to get in trouble.
Well, here we are. Okay, each of you young 'uns take a gun, a beer and some smokes.
Well-uh... I think I'll-uh uuduh-I think I left the oven on.
Alright. So far, everybody has a long piece of straw. We'll keep drawing.  Whew.
You guys shoulda seen the crap Randy took last night! It was honestly, the biggest crap anyone has ever taken. Ever.
Now, Tweek, boxing is a Man sport. There is nothing in the world more Man than boxing. It is Man at his most Man. So when you spar with Ned here, just dig deep into that most Man part of you.
No siree. I'm telling you, I got the line. My nephew Stan is the best quarterback the school has ever seen. I guarantee they'll beat the spread.
Goddamnit Ned, I just got that van. How the hell are we supposed to get home?
You little bastard, you cost me fifty bucks.  Why don't you run away and join the circus, you stupid little son of a bitch?! Aaargh!
Heh, I don't think I've ever seen a kid as cool as you Kenny. I'm making you... my honorary nephew.
Well, I guess uh Fort Sumter in South Carolina. That's where the Civil War really escalated.
Okay, everybody! It's time for the Running of the Cows! 
Hold on, I'll get my shotgun! Ned! Ned, come on!  Where did it go?
Well, it's snowing black ash, but what the hell. 
Pussies?! Oh yeah?! Men! It's time to show the world what the Confederate Army has got! We're gonna take Topeka once and for all!
...And with that, let's all go to Tamarack Hill and put on a good show!
Oh, no, I must have picked up the Irish model by mistake.
Aw, hell, uh I've done it too. With Cameron here. 
Here you go.  Wow, those are great. Maybe I should go grab some beers, Ned. Ned, what- a-are you jackin' it?
Uh, well, he couldn't have gone far, unless something drug him off.
Chef, what about the baseball team, the Cleveland Indians, huh? Should they change their name because it's racist?
Oh. I don't take kindly to rich folk. Neither does Ned.
Damn! Damn! I always get that question wrong!
Well, that's not fair! I should be able to say "fag". 
That is the most insane thing I've ever seen. I can't believe those people are on our side. I mean, is our side that crazy?  Oh, hello, Chef. Big debate tomorrow, I guess.  Oh, Jesus, the robes! Chef, this isn't what it looks like. You've gotta listen to us!
I hope you all realize what we might be facing here.  Our only option might be to... eat each other to stay alive. 
Everyone get your hybrid and meet at Dawson's! 
Well Chef, you're welcome to stay with me until you buy another house.
--no longer works. So now, we only kill naimals to, quote, "thin out their numbers". If we don't hunt, then these animals will grow too big in number and they won't have enough food. So you see, we have to kill animals, or else they'll die.  Uhh... So roll the tape.  Here we are at Shafer's Crossing, lookin' for some animals.
Old fool went down to the OC to try to reason with the other team, and he got served up somethin' fierce.
Well, come on everybody. We've got to get to the nearest bus station, quick.
Wait a minute! Where the hell is the short one?
--risking life and limb as we go on location to hunt the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka. Join us, won't ya?
Aaarrrggghh-- Oh no! Out of ammo!  We did it, Ned! We killed the entire Vietcong Army!
You just keep all your flag burnin' and your hippie-rock protest songs on YOUR side o' the town!
And I say it's high time we kicked some ass! Who's with me?!
Give you a taste of your own medicine, you little fibber!
And now, time for Jimbo's Mysteries of the Unexplained.  One of our loyal viewers from South Park sent us some 8mm film of what he claims to be the Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka. Now, as you all know, the Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka can supposedly kill you with one horrid gaze. If a person even so much as looks into the frog's eyes, they can be paralyzed, or even die. And this film proves that that frog may very well exist.  Now watch carefully, you're gonna see the Mexican staring frog.  There! There, did you see it? Roll that back again!  Now, freeze it!  Well, I'd like to know what all you skeptics have to say now! What do you think, Ned?
Yeah? Well, I don't think the bus station is too far from here.
Lookie, Ned, there's some deers!  Quick, Ned! Thin out their numbers!
They say we can't shoot certain animals anymore, unless they're posing an immediate threat. Therefore, before we shoot somethin', we have to say 'It's coming right for us.'
It's the boys! They've modified a bus to get us out of here!
Arrgh-ha-ha-ha! Now, isn't that great?  We have a terrific show for you today: we're gonna kill some elk, and we're gonna kill some mountain goats. Now, the new law passed by Colorado legislature, which Ned and I call "Pussy Law #4", states that we can no longer kill animals in defense.
("PUSSY LAW #4"
NO ANIMAL SHALL BE HARMED,
EVEN IN SELF DEFENSE, UNLESS
SPECIFIC LICENSE AND SEASON IS
IN ORDER. SELF DEFENSE CAN ONLY
BE JUSTIFIED BY EXTREME, PROVABLE
PERIL AND OR DOCUMENTED VISIBLE
BODILY HARM.)
In other words, our old line of, "It's comin' right for us"--
Well Ned, we always kidnapped Middle Park's mascot. But this year we're gonna booby-trap it instead.  And when John Stamos' older brother hits that high F in Loving You, Boom!  No more Middle Park players. 
All right, that's fine! Because our war support songs will be a thousand times better!
Well you can come to our side of town to use the post office and we can go to your side to use the grocery store.
They've been goin' at it for a good thirty minutes.
I'll tell you why. Because he's on drugs and worships the devil!
That's the spirit boys, let's get that testosterone flowin'.
Well, I don't think those are problems  that some Tijuana bottle rockets can't solve!
I want $500 on the South Park Cows.
No, young hunter. I mean, what do you see? You must learn all you can about your kill.
Hey, everybody, look who's here! The AFC Champion Denver Broncos! 
Dammit! Those poor kids must have been so disappointed to have nothin' but them stupid wussy snakes to light.
Damnit Ned, doesn't that thing have a volume control?
Dumb-ass! You've got to keep your eyes away from him!  Stay down. Ned, you take flight position; I'll try and keep it turned away from you.
Lincoln and Davis signed the treaty, General. The war is over.
But then you had us do all that for nothin'. Don't you see: If you get rich sellin' these homes, then there will still be rich people in South Park.
Ah hell, I guess we better go look for him. Ned, we got to cut it short. Fire out the 12-20!  Well, I think that's about the limit for our fishing permit.
Hey, aren't those the people we at first thought took the wooden cow?
Ned, I'm starting to think that maybe history ain't worth defendin' sometimes.
Kyle, Kyle, he's our man. If he can't win it, I'm out 50 bucks.
Let's get back to base camp. We can ride the log ride before it closes! 
Well, sure, Vietnam was fun. But not like goin-to-the-circus fun, or fly-fishin-in-Montana fun. No, Vietnam was more like shovin' shards of broken glass up your ass and then sittin' in a tub of Tabasco sauce fun.
Hello there, fellow American. We're just anxious to get back to our homeland.
Well can't we stop them? Let's call the bank.
Hell, everything's legal in México. It's the American way. 
Um, sure.  What the-? Ey, where's the s'more schnapps?
So, whatever side we're on is the side that's gonna lose, right?
Well, I tell you what: we may not have Elway this year, but Brister won every game he started in last year.
You know, Loving you is easy 'cause you're beautiful doo-nn-doo-nn-doo-doo... Aaaaah
What the hell's wrong with you? Can't you have a little alcohol?  Christ, look at that little bastard go!  Now you see that Stan? Now, now that is a dirty little bastard!
We've been way too divisive over this, Chef. Maybe we can come up with a- compromise flag—something that everybody can be happy with.
Holy Crow! I've never seen anything like it!
And now, to clarify how the reenactment should unfold, let's bring up our master historian, Grandpa Marvin Marsh,  the only man old enough to have actually seen the Civil War... reenactment of 1924.
That's a lot of lead, Mr. Director. I don't eat pretty, but if a few of us must die so the rest can stay alive, so be it.
Yeah. Next house we'll do a capital T, to show 'em we REALLY mean business!
All o' you men. You may have lost in the Union today, but join us now and win back your pride!
Nonsense! Not with my nephew at quarterback. Right Stanley?
Don't worry Mrs. Cartman, we'll take good care of him. I brought my old war buddy Ned to keep things safe.
Hey! This window is shot out, too! That means the killer was not someone in this room!
Well, that does it! Let's go tell everyone from Jersey we don't want 'em here!
Aw, Ned, don't burp-talk. That just sicks me out.
Hey Ned, hand me that gin.  You boys want to tie one on?
All right! Well, I think we got what we wanted.
This one's yours Stan.  It's coming right for us.
Well, how do you like that? Bottle rockets saved the Fourth of July!
What are we gonna do, Mayor? This killer is on the loose!
Well, Ned, looks like we'll have to use the old Indian fire trick.
The last three are getting away, shoot 'em Ned. 
So why don't we all say that we want the flag changed. That way, most folks'll vote to keep it the way it is.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't get too carried away now...
Now remember, everybody: for a good reenactment we've got to pretend down to the last detail that we're really in the Civil War. So when the North wins, all of us on the Confederate side should act all bummed and depressed. 
Would you look at that, Ned? That's a Tijuana bottle rocket! These babies have enough power to blast a fiery hole right through the ozone.
Well, uh I guhess one little cheers is in order.
Ey, that's not fair! You can't let home-schooled kids into a public-school spelling bee!
Stan, some things you kill, and some things you don't. See?
To buy fireworks. Just 'cause some kid blew off his hands doesn't mean the rest of us have to suffer, now, does it?
What gives them the right to shoot down our drones?!
This year is a very special Cow Days because we are revealing our all-new Cow Memorial!  Which will live forever in South Park from this day forth. Release the curtain! 
Alright, you want a rifle!  well, like this .22 caliber.  What is it you intend to shoot?
Man, it is about to get crazy up in here.
Holy crap, Ned! That's the biggest Goddamned deer I have ever seen!
Alrighty then! May I suggest a Stratford 12mm? Here, try it on!  That looks really nice on you. The lacquered black really matches your eyes.
Nice plan, kid, except there's one giant flaw. That hippie crowd is massive! How the hell are we supposed to get through it and reach the stage?
He casually dropped this on his way out! 
That's right, Stanley. Animals are much easier to shoot in the morning.
Well, what are we waitin' for? Let's kill it! 
Well, sure. I mean, eh...  Well, no uh, I guess not.
All right, damn it! We're not going to stand for this! Now, whoever stole our golden cow memorial, we're gonna find you and kill you!  Aall right, uhow about this? Whoever took the sacred cow, just please return 'im, and there'll be no questions asked.  Wait a minute. You folks from out of town. You're the only ones with a reason to take our beloved cow memorial! 
I guess we learned our lesson: you can't fight rich folk; they're just too powerful.
Hey Randy, can I borrow your uh...  What the hell are they doing?
Yes, now we're about to roll the film, but remember: if you look the Mexican staring frog in the eyes, you could go catatonic. We don't know if this applies to pictures of the frog or not, but who wants to take chances? So when we roll this film, be sure to look away.  Okay, roll the film, Tom.  Is it over? Okay, it's over.  Well, there you have it. Undeniable proof that the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka exists.
He's right! The turd could have been put there to cover up 9/11!
Boy, we really got the President by the balls. Good thing you have that videotape of him and Marisa Tomei.
Hwell... maybe a little. But we're all a little gay.
Yeah! The last thing these people want is a bleedin'-heart rock protest song!
What the hell is this trench doing here?!? We can't get across!
Hey Ned, look what I bought you! A new voice box!  You want it? You want it? Yeah! Do you? Yeah! You want it? All right, here you go.  Well, try it out!
Yes?  Dammit! I got it wrong again! What's the answer again?  Holy smokes! What the hell is that?
But Kenny's dead now, Stan, and you're always going to be my nephew. And you can't just kill anything. You understand?
Well, we'll be doing plenty of drinking on this trip; After all, hunting sober is like … fishing … sober. It sure will be nice to get out of the city for a while, away from civilization.
Careful with those, now, those are dangerous.  Point 'em away from your eyes, now.
You can't shoot someone who threatens you just out on the street. Well unless of course you're in a state that has a "stand your ground" law.
Eric! Are you training that pony to please you?!
We shouldn't be fighting amongst ourselves, we should be uniting against metrophobes like these!
Alright, here's the plan. All we gotta do is volunteer to chaperone the dance tomorrow. 
Ned, nobody's gonna vote for our side if it's the side those KKK members are on. Come on, we gotta put a stop to them.
Damn it Stan, you shouldn't have done that!
You're in luck! Ned here used to be the state champion until a grenade blew his arm off.
That's right, Jesus. No respect for their elders. As some of you may know, I host a local show on hunting.  Thanks. We've been hunting the Mexican staring frog for a week based on some video footage we received from a viewer. Well, it turns out that these kids faked the footage!
Ned, I think I can say without any doubt that that was the longest drinking binge we've ever had.
Holy crow. Look, boys! A real live wild turkey!  It's tryin' to outsmart us! Come on, fellas! 
That sure was a great hunting trip. We saved those deer from extinction.
Ned, how the hell could you lose your voice box?!  I can't hear you, Ned. You don't have a trachea. You smoked too much and you had it removed. And then you drank too much and you lost your god-damned voice box, Ned!
Well we don't know what else to do, Mayor!
Dammit, Barbrady! When you draw straws, you're supposed to have one of them short! That's how you decide who loses!
Hey, Ned. Remember that time when we got the anonymous tip back in 'Nam?
It's true, she did. Hu-I'm such a tool.
There it is!  Hey, hey! I saw it first! I get the first shot!  Here, turkey turkey. 
These look like its tracks. He must have gone this way. Ned, prepare some HK-12 and some plasticine. I'll bet that sucker's headed for a higher elevation. The higher up it- BIRD!!  The higher up it goes, the better it can breathe.
Sounds like it ran into the ostrich trap!  Sshh. Now keep quiet. All right. I'm gonna turn my flashlight on. It may get startled, so be ready. 
Ned, we are going to get our asses kicked.
Aghh! What the hell are you doing? I almost looked right at it!
Ey, General, he's reenacting Jefferson Davis! You can't talk that way to a superior officer!
The jakovasaurs would have gone extinct if we hadn't interfered. Because their particular form of life simply wasn't practical.
Look, if you wanna get revenge on somebody, you've gotta think like a hunter. 
Comin' up next, we're gonna drop some napalm on an unsuspecting family of beavers. And also, try to thin out the numbers of some endangered species.
Ned, it's our job to get these to children all over America for the Fourth of July.  We'll be like Santa Claus on Christmas morning.
Hey, government! You can't ignore our anguished cries anymore! You hear that?! You Government?! 
Now that is a man who has eaten a lot of beef!
Alright, then.  Wait, why the hell are you trainin' Denkins' pony to bite off someone's penis?
That's the last of it! We're out of ammo!
Aw, look at 'em, Ned. Look how much happiness a little firepower can bring to a child.
Did you see that?! I was imperiled by that ferocious, charging buck.
Don't feel too bad there, kid. I never knew who my father was either. I mean, I did know who he was and well, we had some great times together in huntin' and fishin' whe-well, hell, you know what I mean. 
Well, you should be fine so long as the person breaks into your house and is an immediate threat to you.
Holy crow! We could make a mint killing this thing.
We have to have the energy to make it through the night. We have to eat.
Well, John Stamos' older brother is all set to sing 'Loving You' during halftime. We want that bomb to go off when he hits that high F.
You boys go make me proud now and win that debate- Chris Peterson!  God-damnit, we missed him again!
Sure! When it comes to spelling bees, always bet on the Jew.
Well, all right. Ned, get the Mayor on the phone, tell her that we... hoh yeah, he can't talk. All right, never mind, I'll do it.
Ah I hate when the Mayor uses Christmas for her own political agenda.  Light the damn tree!
