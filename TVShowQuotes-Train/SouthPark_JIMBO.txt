Well, Jesus, I definitely learned my lesson. Neeever bet on evil, 'cause when you d- Ned! Look, there's a rare duck-billed platypus!  Ih-it's comin' right for us! 

Everyone. Everyone, listen. FOX Network censored the image of Mohammad at the last minute.

Yeah. How many rich people does it take to screw in a light bulb? None! They can hire people to do it for them! 

I uh... Well, okay, I might have embellished the truth a little, but that's different.

On what?

You just keep all your flag burnin' and your hippie-rock protest songs on YOUR side o' the town!

Well, let's kill it.

Whoa, look out! 

Oh, no!

What?!

The kindergarten teacher is suspected of having sex with a student

Alrighty everyone. We just have a few things to go over before we head out to the reenactment battlefield.  First of all, I have great news. There are over 200 folks from around the state that have come to see this year's reenactment, and that's the best turnout ever!

Aw, look at 'em, Ned. Look how much happiness a little firepower can bring to a child.

SURRENDER YOUR MEN, GENERAL!

Aghh! What the hell are you doing? I almost looked right at it!

Please. Don't let them ruin our town.

Let's go thirty one! Let's see it! 

Mayor, shouldn't we be focusi--

Mhmm Ned, that voice box sucks!

Well, come on everybody. We've got to get to the nearest bus station, quick.

Forward! 

Get around th' side there, Ned. I can't get a shot in from here.

Chef, I respect you very much, but you have to understand that this has been the South Park flag since some of our ancestors, like my great-grandfather, founded this land!

I don't know. I guess we'll see.

Yep.

Well,  we're not going anywhere for a loong time.

You damn kids!

Now boys, boys, ah-I need to get serious for a minute. I want you to understand a few basic rules of hunting, since this is your first time. First, don't ever walk with your gun unless the safety's on. Second, don't shoot anything that looks human, and third, never spill your beer in the bullet chamber.

Alright, here's the plan. All we gotta do is volunteer to chaperone the dance tomorrow. 

Yeah. Let's get that luggage packed!

Where to next, General?

Hey! Who's that?!

You see… Ned picked up the grenade and… BOOM, blasted his arm clear off. We spent three hours looking for that damn arm, but it was never to be found. Some say it's still crawling around to this day.

Wow, look at that! The entire state of South Carolina showed up! 

Come on everybody, let's do the Drunken Barn Dance! 

Well, sure. I mean, eh...  Well, no uh, I guess not.

Huh, cut it out, Ned! That's just disgusting!

Yeah. You know, uh I suddenly found myself on the side of Klan members. I've never had anything against blacks, Chef.

Oh. I don't take kindly to rich folk. Neither does Ned.

Punch him in the balls, Tweek!! 

Oh, lookie who's here. My little nephew Stanley.  So, you're interested in your Uncle Jimbo's big TV show, huh?

I think we should switch sides!

Damn! Damn! I always get that question wrong!

All right, that's fine! Because our war support songs will be a thousand times better!

And now, to clarify how the reenactment should unfold, let's bring up our master historian, Grandpa Marvin Marsh,  the only man old enough to have actually seen the Civil War... reenactment of 1924.

What in Sam Hell?

There's a murderer free in South Park. We have to find out who it is before they kill again.

Hey! There's some more schnapps over here!

There's only one answer: eat Eric Roberts. 

Ned, for Christ's sake, stop jackin'!

No.

What the hell is this trench doing here?!? We can't get across!

No, sir.

I hope so, Mayor. I hope so. Uhud I need a cold beer and a burger.  What's all the ruckus over there? 

Keep your guard up, Tweek! 

Aw, come on. Have a little sip. 

Give me some more s'more schnapps! I'm gonna be sick.  Blouach.

Well we don't know what else to do, Mayor!

Uh, that's okay, I'll stand.

Well, that does it! Let's go tell everyone from Jersey we don't want 'em here!

Well, that's not fair! I should be able to say "fag". 

Wait, there's a ram! It's coming right for us!  Nice shootin' Kenny. Here, you need a bigger gun.

Hit the deck! 

Yeah, it's almost like something funny's going on.  Christ, Ned, what'd you have for breakfast.

Soon it was all on just me and Ned to win the war for America.

Middle Park by 70 points.

Wait a minute! Where the hell is the short one?

Yep.

Ey, that's not fair! You can't let home-schooled kids into a public-school spelling bee!

No, because it's their history!

Lowercase "t"?

I see 'em! Drop the bomb!

What?! Give me those!  Holy crow, he's right, Ned! Mrs. Tenorman's lettin' the twins out!

They say we can't shoot certain animals anymore, unless they're posing an immediate threat. Therefore, before we shoot somethin', we have to say 'It's coming right for us.'

The last three are getting away, shoot 'em Ned. 

Hey, now. Everything I told you boys about the war actually happened.

See now with a "stand your ground" law, you could legally shoot somebody that's threatening you whether they're in your house or not.

You can't shoot someone who threatens you just out on the street. Well unless of course you're in a state that has a "stand your ground" law.

All right, everyone get in and get a seal on that door!

Well, John Stamos' older brother is all set to sing 'Loving You' during halftime. We want that bomb to go off when he hits that high F.

The South wins!

Oh, was that it? Was that it?!

And I'm telling you it WON'T!

And I say it's high time we kicked some ass! Who's with me?!

Hah, got ya.

Hehehaahaa, hey, stop-drop-and roll Ned. Haaahaaaaahaha!! 

Well, we can all be friends now.  Come on, Randy. Have some s'more schnapps. 

I remember back in the day, RICH folk weren't alLOWED in South Park! Now thery're movin' here in droves!

Well, what are we waitin' for? Let's kill it! 

No, dammit! The Aaaaah.

Yeah!

You what?!?

Surrender your men, general!

Shhh, not so loud. Now that there's just a technicality.

I'm also very proud to announce that this year's alcohol sponsor, Jagermin's S'more-flavored Schnapps, the schnapps with the delightful taste of s'mores.

Damn it Stan, you shouldn't have done that!

Charge!

Atta boy! Now quick, get him again while he's down! 

Wow! Do we got more money?

That worked perfectly, Ned.

Come on Ned, we gotta get our asses to the bookie.

Let's hunt!

Uh Professor, we all just thought of somethin'. If everyone has their head buried by the person standing to their left, then who's gonna bury the last person's head?

Hey, government! You can't ignore our anguished cries anymore! You hear that?! You Government?! 

Aaaaahh.

I wanna change my bet to Satan.

That is the most insane thing I've ever seen. I can't believe those people are on our side. I mean, is our side that crazy?  Oh, hello, Chef. Big debate tomorrow, I guess.  Oh, Jesus, the robes! Chef, this isn't what it looks like. You've gotta listen to us!

It shows how beautiful the innocence of a child really is. 

Come on! We gotta buy more duct tape.

That's the spirit boys, let's get that testosterone flowin'.

Alrighty. Tweek, my little nephew Stanley has asked me to teach you the fine points of boxing.

Um, sure.  What the-? Ey, where's the s'more schnapps?

Holy smokes, that blizzard is getting crazy!

What?

Uh, for what?

That sure was a great hunting trip. We saved those deer from extinction.

Quick Ned, shoot it!

Come on, Randy. You have to push! 

By God, he's right!

Look, we have to accept the fact that most people in the world hate us, right?

We have to give in to their demands.

Yeah, it was like wrestling a Louisiana alligator, this thing. Put up one hell of a fight. 

Huh?

What the hell's wrong with you? Can't you have a little alcohol?  Christ, look at that little bastard go!  Now you see that Stan? Now, now that is a dirty little bastard!

We thought you did.

I guess we showed them!

I can't tell; let's kill it!

Yo necesito el fireworko spectacularrrr.

What we'll have to do here Carl is put a trigger on that bomb that makes it go off at a specific moment during halftime.

Uh, I don't feel nothin'.

Aw, he'll be fine. I'll just take him home and show him some good hard-core porn, he'll snap right out of it. Won't you, Ned? 

Now THAT'S BOXING!

So long as they're threatening you.

Oh. Yeah, we sure were.

Well, you should be fine so long as the person breaks into your house and is an immediate threat to you.

I don't have to remind you just how important this game is to us South Park Alumni.

Let's move, moove! 

Chef, what about the baseball team, the Cleveland Indians, huh? Should they change their name because it's racist?

Anonymous tip?

It's like some mystical evil force.

What the hell are you talking about, you don't want to shoot the bunny? You're babbling, you're not making any sense, you're hysterical.

Come on, Randy, what do you say?!

Aaaaahh.

'Loving You'? That's perfect! Come on Ned, Middle Park's gonna get a Halftime show they'll never forget.

Awwww.

Who is that?! 

Man, it is about to get crazy up in here.

Stan, some things you kill, and some things you don't. See?

--no longer works. So now, we only kill naimals to, quote, "thin out their numbers". If we don't hunt, then these animals will grow too big in number and they won't have enough food. So you see, we have to kill animals, or else they'll die.  Uhh... So roll the tape.  Here we are at Shafer's Crossing, lookin' for some animals.

Holy smokes! Play dead, Ned!

Nice thinking, young hunter.

Hey, Ned. Remember that time when we got the anonymous tip back in 'Nam?

You got it...

Let's go!

Well-uh... I think I'll-uh uuduh-I think I left the oven on.

But Kenny's dead now, Stan, and you're always going to be my nephew. And you can't just kill anything. You understand?

Welluh, that sounds great. I'm gonna get some s'more schnapps. You want anything?

Jesus, Ned, these guys are completely nuts.

Buenos dias, mi amigo. Yo soy un Americano espectacularrr.

No!

Now remember, everybody: for a good reenactment we've got to pretend down to the last detail that we're really in the Civil War. So when the North wins, all of us on the Confederate side should act all bummed and depressed. 

You see boys, the Democrats have passed a lot of laws trying to stop us from hunting.

Ned, how the hell could you lose your voice box?!  I can't hear you, Ned. You don't have a trachea. You smoked too much and you had it removed. And then you drank too much and you lost your god-damned voice box, Ned!

Wow!

Fire! 

Because Cotswolds is gonna to live there. And when he shows up, we all grab him, bring him out here, and duct-tape him to the flagpole!

Don't change history!

This calls for some HJ-14.

Hold on, I'll get my shotgun! Ned! Ned, come on!  Where did it go?

Alrighty everyone.  We're going to do the entire reenactment again, because of some confusion over the bell. Now, I know you're just trying to help Eric, but we have to let the Union capture the bell this time.

No.

Pussies?! Oh yeah?! Men! It's time to show the world what the Confederate Army has got! We're gonna take Topeka once and for all!

What?

Huh?

Oh, why can't we all live at the mall?!

Oh, ho, that's disgusting.

To buy fireworks. Just 'cause some kid blew off his hands doesn't mean the rest of us have to suffer, now, does it?

Alright, Ned. We've got to be careful. These are really evil men we're dealing with.

Quick, Ned! This is our chance! The Hummer's outside!

Well, how do you like that? Bottle rockets saved the Fourth of July!

Well, son, I think you have a pretty stupid plan there.

Oh. Well, does Mr. Denkins know you're usin' his pony? He shoots trespassers on sight, you know.

Okay, that's enough o' that! You cows need to dis-perse!  All right, bad cows! Do you hear me? Bad cows!  All right, Ned. You're gonna have to bust out the whip!

Roger.

You hear that, cows? You're surrounded! There's no way out!

Alright, let's do it.

Sure! When it comes to spelling bees, always bet on the Jew.

We're gonna be all right!

Stay out of this, Gerald! Some men care about what their wives are doing!

Careful with those, now, those are dangerous.  Point 'em away from your eyes, now.

The lava's comin' right for us!

What the hell's goin' on?!

It's true, she did. Hu-I'm such a tool.

Are we sure it's Scuzzlebutt?

Nonsense! Not with my nephew at quarterback. Right Stanley?

Medic! 

...And with that, let's all go to Tamarack Hill and put on a good show!

You sent in those videos?!

Great, we...

Why the hell not? We're at war.  Hey, you know those things are bad for your throat.

He's right! The turd could have been put there to cover up 9/11!

So how do we do that?

Good! Now kick his balls!  There, see? You've got him coughing up blood.

Dumb-ass! You've got to keep your eyes away from him!  Stay down. Ned, you take flight position; I'll try and keep it turned away from you.

All right, damn it! We're not going to stand for this! Now, whoever stole our golden cow memorial, we're gonna find you and kill you!  Aall right, uhow about this? Whoever took the sacred cow, just please return 'im, and there'll be no questions asked.  Wait a minute. You folks from out of town. You're the only ones with a reason to take our beloved cow memorial! 

Hey Randy, can I borrow your uh...  What the hell are they doing?

Heh, I am stoned off my ass!

Hey, check it out! 

Man, that guy is a jerk. 

Now that is a man who has eaten a lot of beef!

That's right, Stanley. Animals are much easier to shoot in the morning.

Maybe he really is stupid, Randy.

They're in!

Excuse me, Mayor, but I just received some news that you might all be interested in.  Our South Park Cows have just beaten the Washington dodgeball team, and are on their way to the world championship in China. 

Eric! Are you training that pony to please you?!

You pansy! give me that gun.

Well, it appears as though a lot of you "skeptics" thought that the film we showed of the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka was a fake. That you say it didn't harm anybody. Well, it just so happens that we just received another film from another anonymous viewer.  Roll it!  There you go! Proof that not only is this frog real, but it is doing harm to the people of South Park as we speak!

Oh my God!  Well, don't worry boys, Uncle Jimbo is on the case.  Buckle your seat belt, Ned.

Yeehaw!

Well Chef, you're welcome to stay with me until you buy another house.

What time is it, Barbrady?

Hey, aren't those the people we at first thought took the wooden cow?

Dammit, Barbrady! When you draw straws, you're supposed to have one of them short! That's how you decide who loses!

What the? What's wrong with you?

Alright, then.  Wait, why the hell are you trainin' Denkins' pony to bite off someone's penis?

Well boys, I'm sorry I got you all killed. 

You know what? I'll bet we could take Topeka right now and clear them all around!

"Don't Sue People" Panda? 

Hey, Ned! A package came for you today from Voice Box Express.

Well, I guess uh Fort Sumter in South Carolina. That's where the Civil War really escalated.

What do you see? 

Yepper, but I think we've learned some important lessons Ned I think that- 

Hey there, boys!

Good luck!

We'll give the storm another hour. After that, we might have to eat again.

He casually dropped this on his way out! 

We got it! The fort is ours! 

Okay, everybody, okay. Settle down. Now I know you're all anxious to get to the Running of the Cows, BUT, let me remind you: those brave souls who have decided to run against the cows through town do so at their own risk. I don't think I have to remind you that three people died in last year's Running of the Cows.  With that said, let's rock and roll!  Everybody ready to run?  Release the cows!  They're loose! 

Come on Ned, and keep quiet.

Ned, look.  They've got Enrique on their sideline, and it looks like that bomb's still attached.

Boy. You must really wanna take to to those Orange County kids now, huh, Stan?

Well that guy's just plain nuts.

Let's get him! 

Well, all right. Ned, get the Mayor on the phone, tell her that we... hoh yeah, he can't talk. All right, never mind, I'll do it.

How come you're not blowin' things up? It's summer.

Hey, now that's not true. My shoes don't say I pound butt.

No, I mean, your actual balls!

Ey, General, he's reenacting Jefferson Davis! You can't talk that way to a superior officer!

What..?

Oho, it was awful!  Cow after cow taking its own life, and we could do nothing to stop them! Oh, God!

Randy! Randy, you've got to get out of here! If they just trample this park, we'll be trapped! It's too dangerous!

Step 1: Find someone's weakness. Step 2: Exploit that weakness.

Bring it on, you bitch! 

Well, that does it! All this week, Ned and I will be--

I just came from Will Patterson's house! His mother got three packages from Amazon! And the UPS guy told her what he'd like to do to her!

And now, time for Jimbo's Mysteries of the Unexplained.  One of our loyal viewers from South Park sent us some 8mm film of what he claims to be the Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka. Now, as you all know, the Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka can supposedly kill you with one horrid gaze. If a person even so much as looks into the frog's eyes, they can be paralyzed, or even die. And this film proves that that frog may very well exist.  Now watch carefully, you're gonna see the Mexican staring frog.  There! There, did you see it? Roll that back again!  Now, freeze it!  Well, I'd like to know what all you skeptics have to say now! What do you think, Ned?

Hey Ned, hand me that gin.  You boys want to tie one on?

Aw, I forgot all about them.

No, no, see, you've gotta be IN a state with a "stand your ground" law, like Florida.

I don't know.

I'll bet we could, too! 

Good work, Ned. Now they won't starve.

We have to have the energy to make it through the night. We have to eat.

It is amazing what people can do under stress. Just look at the pyramids. Nobody knows how they built those, or who.

Lincoln and Davis signed the treaty, General. The war is over.

Oh Jesus, it's burning! Oh my God!

Yes?  Dammit! I got it wrong again! What's the answer again?  Holy smokes! What the hell is that?

Heh, I don't think I've ever seen a kid as cool as you Kenny. I'm making you... my honorary nephew.

And you saw it here, on The Jimbo and Ned Show.

Alrighty then! May I suggest a Stratford 12mm? Here, try it on!  That looks really nice on you. The lacquered black really matches your eyes.

Don't do it, Randy. If Muhammad is seen, we could get bombed.

Yeah.

Hey Ned, why don't you whip out the ol' cancer kazoo? Let's do a little song.

How do you tell him? "Hey Gerald, Sorry, but the UPS man is bangin' your wife." It's really none of our business.

Listen, everybody. We did what we had to in there.

Hey Ned, look what I bought you! A new voice box!  You want it? You want it? Yeah! Do you? Yeah! You want it? All right, here you go.  Well, try it out!

Daaagh!

Fourteen?! 

That's us!

Oh, Jesus, don't start singing, Ned!

Me??

You guys shoulda seen the crap Randy took last night! It was honestly, the biggest crap anyone has ever taken. Ever.

I have to admit it, that is a lot nicer.

That's it. Thaaat's it! 

Yeah, you're right. Okay, let's try again.

You boys don't understand. Ned was so freaked out by the idea of the Mexican staring frog that he must have sent himself into a deep coma.

Where is he?!

That lava's coming right for us!! 

Randy? Randy, what happened?

Well, it's snowing black ash, but what the hell. 

You sure?

Uh oh.

Ah I hate when the Mayor uses Christmas for her own political agenda.  Light the damn tree!

Uh, well, he couldn't have gone far, unless something drug him off.

Damn, Ned, I've never seen that much cash.

Well, here we are. Okay, each of you young 'uns take a gun, a beer and some smokes.

Dammit! Those poor kids must have been so disappointed to have nothin' but them stupid wussy snakes to light.

Holy smokes! We could get an Emmy!

They don't?!

Aw, nuts! Come on, Ned, this ain't no whore house, it's a hor-ROR house.

Holy Crow! I've never seen anything like it!

Alright Richard!

Give 'em hell Stanley!  Jesus, now I haven't asked you for much, but all we need is one little score. Please? Please, Jesus?

Let's say they should change the flag!

This one's yours Stan.  It's coming right for us.

Hey, how's practice coming there Chef?

Now, Tweek, boxing is a Man sport. There is nothing in the world more Man than boxing. It is Man at his most Man. So when you spar with Ned here, just dig deep into that most Man part of you.

Kyle, Kyle, he's our man. If he can't win it, I'm out 50 bucks.

Well, be sure to join us next time. Until then...
We're so glad you spent your time with us
While we slaughtered our way through nature's guts
Come again and stay a while
We'll kill a lot more living things to make them bleed

Yes! Oh my God!

Aaarrrggghh-- Oh no! Out of ammo!  We did it, Ned! We killed the entire Vietcong Army!

That's a lot of lead, Mr. Director. I don't eat pretty, but if a few of us must die so the rest can stay alive, so be it.

I remember I had just gotten off the Ferris wheel.

Ned, I think I can say without any doubt that that was the longest drinking binge we've ever had.

South Park Cows do it again!

Fire away, we have nothing to hide.

Who? The fat kid?

Well, I don't think those are problems  that some Tijuana bottle rockets can't solve!

Would you look at that, Ned? That's a Tijuana bottle rocket! These babies have enough power to blast a fiery hole right through the ozone.

Huwell, uh he's got a point there.

All o' you men. You may have lost in the Union today, but join us now and win back your pride!

We followed blindly for thousands of years and we think the least God can do is show up for New Year's Eve 1999!

What??

Anything else?

México, my amigo.

Okay, everybody! It's time for the Running of the Cows! 

There there Randy, you... You gave it your best shot.

Mayor, it's about the South Park flag.

Hey, look! Ned's doin' his trick again! 

Damnit Ned, doesn't that thing have a volume control?

Like what?

Would this be for hunting, home protection, or other?

What the hell?!

That's the spirit, kiddo. Let's hunt!

Hello there, Enrique.

Aw, thank God you're alright, kid.  It was an accident, I swear. Uh, is there any way we can make it up to you?

He's gay!!

These look like its tracks. He must have gone this way. Ned, prepare some HK-12 and some plasticine. I'll bet that sucker's headed for a higher elevation. The higher up it- BIRD!!  The higher up it goes, the better it can breathe.

Goddamnit Ned, I just got that van. How the hell are we supposed to get home?

C'mon, let's move, move!

Yeah!

Oh crap!

Alright. So far, everybody has a long piece of straw. We'll keep drawing.  Whew.

Gotcha!

There he is! Kill him! Kill him!  Oh, wait, that's not him. 

Hell's bells.

There it is!  Hey, hey! I saw it first! I get the first shot!  Here, turkey turkey. 

Holy crow! We could make a mint killing this thing.

Give you a taste of your own medicine, you little fibber!

Can I help you?

What the hell's going on here? 

That's right, Jesus. No respect for their elders. As some of you may know, I host a local show on hunting.  Thanks. We've been hunting the Mexican staring frog for a week based on some video footage we received from a viewer. Well, it turns out that these kids faked the footage!

We'll never give up! You bastards!

Well, enough of the lectures. let's get to boxing. 

Well, stop it! 

Dear God, they're bigger than I ever imagined!

They're dead, mayor. They're all dead. 

Oo what's a Radiohead?

Sounds like it ran into the ostrich trap!  Sshh. Now keep quiet. All right. I'm gonna turn my flashlight on. It may get startled, so be ready. 

Close the door! 

Yep, there goes the neighborhood. 

Here he comes!

Play ball!  Steeeeee-riiike

God damn, I love football!

Yeah, I just wanted to  try to set an example, you know?

Not that sure. I think we better come up with a backup plan. Uhh, let's see here. Hey, bookie! Wha- what's the halftime show gonna be?

Satan. Got it.

You little bastard, you cost me fifty bucks.  Why don't you run away and join the circus, you stupid little son of a bitch?! Aaargh!

--risking life and limb as we go on location to hunt the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka. Join us, won't ya?

Yes, now we're about to roll the film, but remember: if you look the Mexican staring frog in the eyes, you could go catatonic. We don't know if this applies to pictures of the frog or not, but who wants to take chances? So when we roll this film, be sure to look away.  Okay, roll the film, Tom.  Is it over? Okay, it's over.  Well, there you have it. Undeniable proof that the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka exists.

It's a long shot.

Oh, now, why the long faces?

Aw, hell, uh I've done it too. With Cameron here. 

This is all Stan's fault! He wrote that gay little song and got us to drive those damned hybrids!

You heard the General.

Oh, no, I must have picked up the Irish model by mistake.

Well thanks, Officer Dickhole!

But then you had us do all that for nothin'. Don't you see: If you get rich sellin' these homes, then there will still be rich people in South Park.

So why don't we all say that we want the flag changed. That way, most folks'll vote to keep it the way it is.

Great instincts boy.

Oh, finally!

Hey. Where's she going? That's the wrong way, you stupid cow! 

Jimminy Hope, it's the real Scuzzlebutt!

What?!

Hell, everything's legal in México. It's the American way. 

We cannot change the South Park flag, Mayor!

The mountain! It's blown it's top! 

What?!

We've been way too divisive over this, Chef. Maybe we can come up with a- compromise flag—something that everybody can be happy with.

God wants you to live, Mayor. Fight! 

Thatta boy.

Ned, we are going to get our asses kicked.

Boy, we really got the President by the balls. Good thing you have that videotape of him and Marisa Tomei.

What happened, Glen?

Oh, hell, I have to run home and get my broom!

Randy! Jesus, Randy. Your balls!

Yeah, I wanted to order that theft alarm for my IT.

We shouldn't be fighting amongst ourselves, we should be uniting against metrophobes like these!

All right!

They did it!

Hey everybody! AIDS is finally funny!

No, young hunter. I mean, what do you see? You must learn all you can about your kill.

Hi, I'm Jimbo Kern, and this here is Ned. Say hi, Ned.

Look, if you wanna get revenge on somebody, you've gotta think like a hunter. 

Hehe, yeah. Don't- don't worry yourself.

Holy crap, Ned! That's the biggest Goddamned deer I have ever seen!

I guess we learned our lesson: you can't fight rich folk; they're just too powerful.

Well, I tell you what: we may not have Elway this year, but Brister won every game he started in last year.

What? What is it?

No nephew of mine is gonna be a tree hugger.

Don't feel too bad there, kid. I never knew who my father was either. I mean, I did know who he was and well, we had some great times together in huntin' and fishin' whe-well, hell, you know what I mean. 

Huh??

He's back!

Tough love, Mr. Mackey. We're taking you to rehab.

You're in luck! Ned here used to be the state champion until a grenade blew his arm off.

Ned, nobody's gonna vote for our side if it's the side those KKK members are on. Come on, we gotta put a stop to them.

Quick Ned, shoot it!

Ccchhhhaaaarrrrggggeeee!

We have to take 'em out, Ned! At all costs! Die, you red commie bastards! 

You can do it, kid! You can do it!

A ladder tuh... Oh... oh God. 

Hold onto your butts.  Take that, you demon frog!  Ned, Ned? Can you hear me?  Quick! Somebody, call an ambulance! This man is catatonic!

That's the last of it! We're out of ammo!

What?! 

Well, Ned, looks like we'll have to use the old Indian fire trick.

We just encourage them to find someplace better.

Let's get back to base camp. We can ride the log ride before it closes! 

Alright, Ned. Now we're coming up to the American border. They can't know that we have fireworks in the trunk. Just let me do the talking.  I guess that goes without saying, doesn't it? 

Ah hell, I guess we better go look for him. Ned, we got to cut it short. Fire out the 12-20!  Well, I think that's about the limit for our fishing permit.

...What??

Well, we'll be doing plenty of drinking on this trip; After all, hunting sober is like … fishing … sober. It sure will be nice to get out of the city for a while, away from civilization.

My best friend is a vegetable, and I'm gonna be the laughingstock of South Park!

Well, sure, Vietnam was fun. But not like goin-to-the-circus fun, or fly-fishin-in-Montana fun. No, Vietnam was more like shovin' shards of broken glass up your ass and then sittin' in a tub of Tabasco sauce fun.

Hey, he's saving us.

Yes.  I mean, no! No!

It's the boys! They've modified a bus to get us out of here!

Hey!

Then we only have one option. 

See ya, Cotswolds.  Thanks for stopping by.

Damn it, I think I missed

Eh, you wanna beer or something, Cotswolds?

Yeah. I know.

Aw, Ned, don't burp-talk. That just sicks me out.

Kenny, you take the front.

Uhhhh... Thanks?

Pass me some more cocoa, will you, Ned?

Nope. He's gay.

What?!  Is that a challenge?! I'll bet we can!

Ned, I'm starting to think that maybe history ain't worth defendin' sometimes.

...Ghosts?

I'll tell you why. Because he's on drugs and worships the devil!

We're goin' home kid. Come on. 

Yeah. Titties and beer.

Here you go.  Wow, those are great. Maybe I should go grab some beers, Ned. Ned, what- a-are you jackin' it?

They've been goin' at it for a good thirty minutes.

No. We can't be.

Mr. Garrison, those are great pants.

No siree. I'm telling you, I got the line. My nephew Stan is the best quarterback the school has ever seen. I guarantee they'll beat the spread.

That'll be Tom Cruise... 

Did you see that?! I was imperiled by that ferocious, charging buck.

W-hell, naturally you could cross the line for that. Just like ...we could cross the line for hardware, supplies, gas, and pharmaceutical needs.

Hey, look out son, that's dangerous. You're gonna spill your beer.

Don't change history!

Hey, everybody, look who's here! The AFC Champion Denver Broncos! 

Boys, looky there. That there's a Rocky Mountain black bear …one of the few remaining of its kind. Isn't it beautiful… By God, it's coming right for us! 

Okay, how about this?

It's a power outage!

I'm sorry, Stan. I was just trying to tell a good story. I never meant for you boys to get in trouble.

So, whatever side we're on is the side that's gonna lose, right?

Well, Ned, looks like we missed Fourth of July again.

Jimminy Hope, it's the real Scuzzlebutt!

Alright, I'll call. Forty-five to you Ned.

Here's the same gun, with a wood finish.

Broflovski, did you put this crap on my windshield?! 

Well you can come to our side of town to use the post office and we can go to your side to use the grocery store.

Yeah, I've been reenacting this war for 22 years now. And for 22 years us Confederate reenactors have had to spend the evening being ridiculed and made fun of by the Union reenactors! Well, I'm sick of it!

Whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't get too carried away now...

Wuh. Well, 'cause we're supposed to lose.

What gives them the right to shoot down our drones?!

He didn't sing the high F.

Fire in the hole!

Great speech!

Yepper, that's where me and Ned met.

Don't y'all worry, you just wait till halftime, hehe.

All right! Well, I think we got what we wanted.

Turkey shoot! 

Hello, fellow hunters. Have we got a show for you today.  The Mexican staring frog is sunning itself on a rock directly behind us.  We've got to take the frog by surprise. I'm gonna create a diversion using this incendiary device  while Ned will ambush him from the rear.  Now, Ned! He's not looking!  Quick, Ned, hit him with the shotgun! Now, Ned!  Ned. Ne-ed?  Oh, no!  Come on, Ned, buddy, snap out of it!  Come back to me, buddy.

Thanks. 

Old fool went down to the OC to try to reason with the other team, and he got served up somethin' fierce.

We're all with you, Jesus! We put every dime we have on you beatin' that Dark Prince. 

O-kay.

Whoa, man.

Welcome, hunters. Boy, have we got a show for you today! We have just received a tape from another viewer who filmed the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka right here in South Park.

That war was hell on everybody. 

Garrison? That's impossible. He's gay.

How come they just let that Bono guy send a picture of his crap?

What do we do, General? We're outnumbered.

Hwell... maybe a little. But we're all a little gay.

Yeah. Next house we'll do a capital T, to show 'em we REALLY mean business!

Buenos gracias, boys.

The jakovasaurs would have gone extinct if we hadn't interfered. Because their particular form of life simply wasn't practical.
