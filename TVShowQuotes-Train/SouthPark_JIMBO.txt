Alright, here's the plan. All we gotta do is volunteer to chaperone the dance tomorrow. 
Shhh, not so loud. Now that there's just a technicality.
Comin' up next, we're gonna drop some napalm on an unsuspecting family of beavers. And also, try to thin out the numbers of some endangered species.
Don't worry Mrs. Cartman, we'll take good care of him. I brought my old war buddy Ned to keep things safe.
Yeah. How many rich people does it take to screw in a light bulb? None! They can hire people to do it for them! 
Alrighty. Tweek, my little nephew Stanley has asked me to teach you the fine points of boxing.
Lincoln and Davis signed the treaty, General. The war is over.
You guys shoulda seen the crap Randy took last night! It was honestly, the biggest crap anyone has ever taken. Ever.
That's the last of it! We're out of ammo!
Wait, there's a ram! It's coming right for us!  Nice shootin' Kenny. Here, you need a bigger gun.
Alright. So far, everybody has a long piece of straw. We'll keep drawing.  Whew.
Well, that does it! All this week, Ned and I will be--
Ned, I think I can say without any doubt that that was the longest drinking binge we've ever had.
Dammit, Barbrady! When you draw straws, you're supposed to have one of them short! That's how you decide who loses!
Huh? Uh hey now, uh. We don't want your support. We're not racists; this is about history.
Don't feel too bad there, kid. I never knew who my father was either. I mean, I did know who he was and well, we had some great times together in huntin' and fishin' whe-well, hell, you know what I mean. 
And now, to clarify how the reenactment should unfold, let's bring up our master historian, Grandpa Marvin Marsh,  the only man old enough to have actually seen the Civil War... reenactment of 1924.
Aw, nuts! Come on, Ned, this ain't no whore house, it's a hor-ROR house.
Ned, we are going to get our asses kicked.
Now remember, everybody: for a good reenactment we've got to pretend down to the last detail that we're really in the Civil War. So when the North wins, all of us on the Confederate side should act all bummed and depressed. 
We have to give in to their demands.
Ned, I'm starting to think that maybe history ain't worth defendin' sometimes.
Well, uh I guhess one little cheers is in order.
Yeah, I just wanted to  try to set an example, you know?
Yeah? Well, I don't think the bus station is too far from here.
There he is! Kill him! Kill him!  Oh, wait, that's not him. 
Hey, government! You can't ignore our anguished cries anymore! You hear that?! You Government?! 
I just came from Will Patterson's house! His mother got three packages from Amazon! And the UPS guy told her what he'd like to do to her!
Damn! Damn! I always get that question wrong!
Alright, you want a rifle!  well, like this .22 caliber.  What is it you intend to shoot?
You see boys, the Democrats have passed a lot of laws trying to stop us from hunting.
We shouldn't be fighting amongst ourselves, we should be uniting against metrophobes like these!
Wait a minute! Where the hell is the short one?
Well, we can all be friends now.  Come on, Randy. Have some s'more schnapps. 
Give 'em hell Stanley!  Jesus, now I haven't asked you for much, but all we need is one little score. Please? Please, Jesus?
Hold onto your butts.  Take that, you demon frog!  Ned, Ned? Can you hear me?  Quick! Somebody, call an ambulance! This man is catatonic!
Hey Ned, why don't you whip out the ol' cancer kazoo? Let's do a little song.
Well you can come to our side of town to use the post office and we can go to your side to use the grocery store.
Tough love, Mr. Mackey. We're taking you to rehab.
I remember back in the day, RICH folk weren't alLOWED in South Park! Now thery're movin' here in droves!
Yeah, I wanted to order that theft alarm for my IT.
Hey. Where's she going? That's the wrong way, you stupid cow! 
Listen, everybody. We did what we had to in there.
To buy fireworks. Just 'cause some kid blew off his hands doesn't mean the rest of us have to suffer, now, does it?
Well, Ned, looks like we'll have to use the old Indian fire trick.
Quick, Ned! This is our chance! The Hummer's outside!
Buenos dias, mi amigo. Yo soy un Americano espectacularrr.
Well, that's not fair! I should be able to say "fag". 
That's a lot of lead, Mr. Director. I don't eat pretty, but if a few of us must die so the rest can stay alive, so be it.
You just keep all your flag burnin' and your hippie-rock protest songs on YOUR side o' the town!
Aw, hell, uh I've done it too. With Cameron here. 
Aw, he'll be fine. I'll just take him home and show him some good hard-core porn, he'll snap right out of it. Won't you, Ned? 
How come they just let that Bono guy send a picture of his crap?
Well, Ned, looks like we missed Fourth of July again.
Pussies?! Oh yeah?! Men! It's time to show the world what the Confederate Army has got! We're gonna take Topeka once and for all!
All right, that's fine! Because our war support songs will be a thousand times better!
Good! Now kick his balls!  There, see? You've got him coughing up blood.
Goddamnit Ned, I just got that van. How the hell are we supposed to get home?
What we'll have to do here Carl is put a trigger on that bomb that makes it go off at a specific moment during halftime.
Well, what are we waitin' for? Let's kill it! 
Well, sure, Vietnam was fun. But not like goin-to-the-circus fun, or fly-fishin-in-Montana fun. No, Vietnam was more like shovin' shards of broken glass up your ass and then sittin' in a tub of Tabasco sauce fun.
..."but Ponyboy was beat up pretty bad. He kept saying, 'stay gold.'"  Aw, Ned. If you can hear me, y-you've got to snap out of it, 'cause if you don't, uh-I'll never forgive myself.  Aw, Stanley, he's gone! My only friend in the world is gone!
Aw, thank God you're alright, kid.  It was an accident, I swear. Uh, is there any way we can make it up to you?
Holy crow! We could make a mint killing this thing.
You boys don't understand. Ned was so freaked out by the idea of the Mexican staring frog that he must have sent himself into a deep coma.
Because Cotswolds is gonna to live there. And when he shows up, we all grab him, bring him out here, and duct-tape him to the flagpole!
Give you a taste of your own medicine, you little fibber!
I hope you all realize what we might be facing here.  Our only option might be to... eat each other to stay alive. 
Old fool went down to the OC to try to reason with the other team, and he got served up somethin' fierce.
Alright, then.  Wait, why the hell are you trainin' Denkins' pony to bite off someone's penis?
Aw, why don't you go to a Grateful Dead concert? 
Oh. Well, does Mr. Denkins know you're usin' his pony? He shoots trespassers on sight, you know.
Oh, no, I must have picked up the Irish model by mistake.
Ned, how the hell could you lose your voice box?!  I can't hear you, Ned. You don't have a trachea. You smoked too much and you had it removed. And then you drank too much and you lost your god-damned voice box, Ned!
Well, all right. Ned, get the Mayor on the phone, tell her that we... hoh yeah, he can't talk. All right, never mind, I'll do it.
Well, I guess uh Fort Sumter in South Carolina. That's where the Civil War really escalated.
Kyle, Kyle, he's our man. If he can't win it, I'm out 50 bucks.
My best friend is a vegetable, and I'm gonna be the laughingstock of South Park!
Alright, Ned. Now we're coming up to the American border. They can't know that we have fireworks in the trunk. Just let me do the talking.  I guess that goes without saying, doesn't it? 
You can do it, kid! You can do it!
Well, it's snowing black ash, but what the hell. 
The jakovasaurs would have gone extinct if we hadn't interfered. Because their particular form of life simply wasn't practical.
And now, time for Jimbo's Mysteries of the Unexplained.  One of our loyal viewers from South Park sent us some 8mm film of what he claims to be the Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka. Now, as you all know, the Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka can supposedly kill you with one horrid gaze. If a person even so much as looks into the frog's eyes, they can be paralyzed, or even die. And this film proves that that frog may very well exist.  Now watch carefully, you're gonna see the Mexican staring frog.  There! There, did you see it? Roll that back again!  Now, freeze it!  Well, I'd like to know what all you skeptics have to say now! What do you think, Ned?
Hey Randy, can I borrow your uh...  What the hell are they doing?
I hope so, Mayor. I hope so. Uhud I need a cold beer and a burger.  What's all the ruckus over there? 
Hey, everybody, look who's here! The AFC Champion Denver Broncos! 
Well, how do you like that? Bottle rockets saved the Fourth of July!
Ah I hate when the Mayor uses Christmas for her own political agenda.  Light the damn tree!
These look like its tracks. He must have gone this way. Ned, prepare some HK-12 and some plasticine. I'll bet that sucker's headed for a higher elevation. The higher up it- BIRD!!  The higher up it goes, the better it can breathe.
How come you're not blowin' things up? It's summer.
Look, we have to accept the fact that most people in the world hate us, right?
Sounds like it ran into the ostrich trap!  Sshh. Now keep quiet. All right. I'm gonna turn my flashlight on. It may get startled, so be ready. 
Damn, Ned, I've never seen that much cash.
Aghh! What the hell are you doing? I almost looked right at it!
Ned, look.  They've got Enrique on their sideline, and it looks like that bomb's still attached.
Welcome, hunters. Boy, have we got a show for you today! We have just received a tape from another viewer who filmed the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka right here in South Park.
Would you look at that, Ned? That's a Tijuana bottle rocket! These babies have enough power to blast a fiery hole right through the ozone.
Come on Ned, we gotta get our asses to the bookie.
What gives them the right to shoot down our drones?!
It's the boys! They've modified a bus to get us out of here!
Aw, look at 'em, Ned. Look how much happiness a little firepower can bring to a child.
Nonsense! Not with my nephew at quarterback. Right Stanley?
There it is!  Hey, hey! I saw it first! I get the first shot!  Here, turkey turkey. 
W-hell, naturally you could cross the line for that. Just like ...we could cross the line for hardware, supplies, gas, and pharmaceutical needs.
You see… Ned picked up the grenade and… BOOM, blasted his arm clear off. We spent three hours looking for that damn arm, but it was never to be found. Some say it's still crawling around to this day.
Dumb-ass! You've got to keep your eyes away from him!  Stay down. Ned, you take flight position; I'll try and keep it turned away from you.
Well, you should be fine so long as the person breaks into your house and is an immediate threat to you.
What?! Give me those!  Holy crow, he's right, Ned! Mrs. Tenorman's lettin' the twins out!
Well-uh... I think I'll-uh uuduh-I think I left the oven on.
We have to take 'em out, Ned! At all costs! Die, you red commie bastards! 
Chef, I respect you very much, but you have to understand that this has been the South Park flag since some of our ancestors, like my great-grandfather, founded this land!
There's a murderer free in South Park. We have to find out who it is before they kill again.
Nice plan, kid, except there's one giant flaw. That hippie crowd is massive! How the hell are we supposed to get through it and reach the stage?
Hey Ned, hand me that gin.  You boys want to tie one on?
Yeah. Next house we'll do a capital T, to show 'em we REALLY mean business!
Damn it Stan, you shouldn't have done that!
The kindergarten teacher is suspected of having sex with a student
Step 1: Find someone's weakness. Step 2: Exploit that weakness.
Well, be sure to join us next time. Until then...
We're so glad you spent your time with us
While we slaughtered our way through nature's guts
Come again and stay a while
We'll kill a lot more living things to make them bleed
Hello there, fellow American. We're just anxious to get back to our homeland.
All right, damn it! We're not going to stand for this! Now, whoever stole our golden cow memorial, we're gonna find you and kill you!  Aall right, uhow about this? Whoever took the sacred cow, just please return 'im, and there'll be no questions asked.  Wait a minute. You folks from out of town. You're the only ones with a reason to take our beloved cow memorial! 
This is about history, kids.  If you don't have respect for your past, then you can never expect to- BIRD!  -then you can never expect to have a future. Nowadays, everyone wants to change mascots and flags because they're not  "politically correct." Well, where does it end? I mean, people are gonna start sayin' that the Denver Broncos are offensive to horses. And then we'll have to- a SQUIRREL!  And then we'll have to change everything, and pretty soon all our history will be forgotten. But to REALLY understand the South Park's flag's importance, you need to know about South Park's history. Ned here's a big history buff, and he can tell you the whole story. Ned?
Hey! This window is shot out, too! That means the killer was not someone in this room!
Damnit Ned, doesn't that thing have a volume control?
Alright, Ned. We've got to be careful. These are really evil men we're dealing with.
You're in luck! Ned here used to be the state champion until a grenade blew his arm off.
I'm also very proud to announce that this year's alcohol sponsor, Jagermin's S'more-flavored Schnapps, the schnapps with the delightful taste of s'mores.
Stan, some things you kill, and some things you don't. See?
Oh. I don't take kindly to rich folk. Neither does Ned.
I want $500 on the South Park Cows.
Ohho, it's a deer. Looks like about a .46 gauge, Ned. It's coming right for us!  
Oh, hell, I have to run home and get my broom!
Excuse me, Mayor, but I just received some news that you might all be interested in.  Our South Park Cows have just beaten the Washington dodgeball team, and are on their way to the world championship in China. 
Well, here we are. Okay, each of you young 'uns take a gun, a beer and some smokes.
That's right, Jesus. No respect for their elders. As some of you may know, I host a local show on hunting.  Thanks. We've been hunting the Mexican staring frog for a week based on some video footage we received from a viewer. Well, it turns out that these kids faked the footage!
Well Ned, we always kidnapped Middle Park's mascot. But this year we're gonna booby-trap it instead.  And when John Stamos' older brother hits that high F in Loving You, Boom!  No more Middle Park players. 
Now that is a man who has eaten a lot of beef!
Ah hell, I guess we better go look for him. Ned, we got to cut it short. Fire out the 12-20!  Well, I think that's about the limit for our fishing permit.
Boy. You must really wanna take to to those Orange County kids now, huh, Stan?
It shows how beautiful the innocence of a child really is. 
Ey, that's not fair! You can't let home-schooled kids into a public-school spelling bee!
Here you go.  Wow, those are great. Maybe I should go grab some beers, Ned. Ned, what- a-are you jackin' it?
Okay, everybody! It's time for the Running of the Cows! 
Well, son, I think you have a pretty stupid plan there.
Uh, well, he couldn't have gone far, unless something drug him off.
How do you tell him? "Hey Gerald, Sorry, but the UPS man is bangin' your wife." It's really none of our business.
--no longer works. So now, we only kill naimals to, quote, "thin out their numbers". If we don't hunt, then these animals will grow too big in number and they won't have enough food. So you see, we have to kill animals, or else they'll die.  Uhh... So roll the tape.  Here we are at Shafer's Crossing, lookin' for some animals.
So, whatever side we're on is the side that's gonna lose, right?
Lookie, Ned, there's some deers!  Quick, Ned! Thin out their numbers!
Oh, lookie who's here. My little nephew Stanley.  So, you're interested in your Uncle Jimbo's big TV show, huh?
You hear that, cows? You're surrounded! There's no way out!
Hey Ned, look what I bought you! A new voice box!  You want it? You want it? Yeah! Do you? Yeah! You want it? All right, here you go.  Well, try it out!
You can't shoot someone who threatens you just out on the street. Well unless of course you're in a state that has a "stand your ground" law.
We're all with you, Jesus! We put every dime we have on you beatin' that Dark Prince. 
What the hell are you talking about, you don't want to shoot the bunny? You're babbling, you're not making any sense, you're hysterical.
Calm down, soldier! We need every person here to keep his head! Barbrady, fetch some straws.
Aw, Ned, don't burp-talk. That just sicks me out.
I remember I had just gotten off the Ferris wheel.
Dammit! Those poor kids must have been so disappointed to have nothin' but them stupid wussy snakes to light.
What the hell's wrong with you? Can't you have a little alcohol?  Christ, look at that little bastard go!  Now you see that Stan? Now, now that is a dirty little bastard!
Hey, Ned! A package came for you today from Voice Box Express.
No nephew of mine is gonna be a tree hugger.
Well, sure. I mean, eh...  Well, no uh, I guess not.
Alrighty everyone. We just have a few things to go over before we head out to the reenactment battlefield.  First of all, I have great news. There are over 200 folks from around the state that have come to see this year's reenactment, and that's the best turnout ever!
And you saw it here, on The Jimbo and Ned Show.
Well, I tell you what: we may not have Elway this year, but Brister won every game he started in last year.
So why don't we all say that we want the flag changed. That way, most folks'll vote to keep it the way it is.
Arrgh-ha-ha-ha! Now, isn't that great?  We have a terrific show for you today: we're gonna kill some elk, and we're gonna kill some mountain goats. Now, the new law passed by Colorado legislature, which Ned and I call "Pussy Law #4", states that we can no longer kill animals in defense.
("PUSSY LAW #4"
NO ANIMAL SHALL BE HARMED,
EVEN IN SELF DEFENSE, UNLESS
SPECIFIC LICENSE AND SEASON IS
IN ORDER. SELF DEFENSE CAN ONLY
BE JUSTIFIED BY EXTREME, PROVABLE
PERIL AND OR DOCUMENTED VISIBLE
BODILY HARM.)
In other words, our old line of, "It's comin' right for us"--
Well, that does it! Let's go tell everyone from Jersey we don't want 'em here!
This is all Stan's fault! He wrote that gay little song and got us to drive those damned hybrids!
Boy, we really got the President by the balls. Good thing you have that videotape of him and Marisa Tomei.
Hello, fellow hunters. Have we got a show for you today.  The Mexican staring frog is sunning itself on a rock directly behind us.  We've got to take the frog by surprise. I'm gonna create a diversion using this incendiary device  while Ned will ambush him from the rear.  Now, Ned! He's not looking!  Quick, Ned, hit him with the shotgun! Now, Ned!  Ned. Ne-ed?  Oh, no!  Come on, Ned, buddy, snap out of it!  Come back to me, buddy.
Ey, General, he's reenacting Jefferson Davis! You can't talk that way to a superior officer!
Now boys, boys, ah-I need to get serious for a minute. I want you to understand a few basic rules of hunting, since this is your first time. First, don't ever walk with your gun unless the safety's on. Second, don't shoot anything that looks human, and third, never spill your beer in the bullet chamber.
...And with that, let's all go to Tamarack Hill and put on a good show!
Yeah, I've been reenacting this war for 22 years now. And for 22 years us Confederate reenactors have had to spend the evening being ridiculed and made fun of by the Union reenactors! Well, I'm sick of it!
It's true, she did. Hu-I'm such a tool.
Come on! We gotta buy more duct tape.
Hey, look out son, that's dangerous. You're gonna spill your beer.
Yeah. You know, uh I suddenly found myself on the side of Klan members. I've never had anything against blacks, Chef.
Ned, it's our job to get these to children all over America for the Fourth of July.  We'll be like Santa Claus on Christmas morning.
But then you had us do all that for nothin'. Don't you see: If you get rich sellin' these homes, then there will still be rich people in South Park.
Chef, what about the baseball team, the Cleveland Indians, huh? Should they change their name because it's racist?
Well we don't know what else to do, Mayor!
Welluh, that sounds great. I'm gonna get some s'more schnapps. You want anything?
Well, John Stamos' older brother is all set to sing 'Loving You' during halftime. We want that bomb to go off when he hits that high F.
We followed blindly for thousands of years and we think the least God can do is show up for New Year's Eve 1999!
Don't y'all worry, you just wait till halftime, hehe.
Well, we'll be doing plenty of drinking on this trip; After all, hunting sober is like … fishing … sober. It sure will be nice to get out of the city for a while, away from civilization.
This year is a very special Cow Days because we are revealing our all-new Cow Memorial!  Which will live forever in South Park from this day forth. Release the curtain! 
Heh, I don't think I've ever seen a kid as cool as you Kenny. I'm making you... my honorary nephew.
They say we can't shoot certain animals anymore, unless they're posing an immediate threat. Therefore, before we shoot somethin', we have to say 'It's coming right for us.'
I don't have to remind you just how important this game is to us South Park Alumni.
This one's yours Stan.  It's coming right for us.
Here's the same gun, with a wood finish.
That's the spirit boys, let's get that testosterone flowin'.
--risking life and limb as we go on location to hunt the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka. Join us, won't ya?
No siree. I'm telling you, I got the line. My nephew Stan is the best quarterback the school has ever seen. I guarantee they'll beat the spread.
Get around th' side there, Ned. I can't get a shot in from here.
Yepper, but I think we've learned some important lessons Ned I think that- 
Now, Tweek, boxing is a Man sport. There is nothing in the world more Man than boxing. It is Man at his most Man. So when you spar with Ned here, just dig deep into that most Man part of you.
I uh... Well, okay, I might have embellished the truth a little, but that's different.
No, young hunter. I mean, what do you see? You must learn all you can about your kill.
Aaarrrggghh-- Oh no! Out of ammo!  We did it, Ned! We killed the entire Vietcong Army!
That sure was a great hunting trip. We saved those deer from extinction.
Everyone get your hybrid and meet at Dawson's! 
Well, enough of the lectures. let's get to boxing. 
Why the hell not? We're at war.  Hey, you know those things are bad for your throat.
Well, I don't think those are problems  that some Tijuana bottle rockets can't solve!
Well,  we're not going anywhere for a loong time.
It is amazing what people can do under stress. Just look at the pyramids. Nobody knows how they built those, or who.
Come on, Ned! We've got to get our asses to the bookie! 
And I say it's high time we kicked some ass! Who's with me?!
He's right! The turd could have been put there to cover up 9/11!
Atta boy! Now quick, get him again while he's down! 
All o' you men. You may have lost in the Union today, but join us now and win back your pride!
Yes, now we're about to roll the film, but remember: if you look the Mexican staring frog in the eyes, you could go catatonic. We don't know if this applies to pictures of the frog or not, but who wants to take chances? So when we roll this film, be sure to look away.  Okay, roll the film, Tom.  Is it over? Okay, it's over.  Well, there you have it. Undeniable proof that the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka exists.
Hey, there's Cotswolds. Come on! Let's duct-tape him to the flagpole!
Hell, everything's legal in México. It's the American way. 
Randy! Randy, you've got to get out of here! If they just trample this park, we'll be trapped! It's too dangerous!
Holy crow. Look, boys! A real live wild turkey!  It's tryin' to outsmart us! Come on, fellas! 
Dear God, they're bigger than I ever imagined!
Holy Crow! I've never seen anything like it!
Yes?  Dammit! I got it wrong again! What's the answer again?  Holy smokes! What the hell is that?
Pass me some more cocoa, will you, Ned?
You little bastard, you cost me fifty bucks.  Why don't you run away and join the circus, you stupid little son of a bitch?! Aaargh!
Yeah! The last thing these people want is a bleedin'-heart rock protest song!
Wow, look at that! The entire state of South Carolina showed up! 
Man, it is about to get crazy up in here.
Everyone. Everyone, listen. FOX Network censored the image of Mohammad at the last minute.
Well boys, I'm sorry I got you all killed. 
Alrighty everyone.  We're going to do the entire reenactment again, because of some confusion over the bell. Now, I know you're just trying to help Eric, but we have to let the Union capture the bell this time.
Hold on, I'll get my shotgun! Ned! Ned, come on!  Where did it go?
Holy crap, Ned! That's the biggest Goddamned deer I have ever seen!
Yeah, it was like wrestling a Louisiana alligator, this thing. Put up one hell of a fight. 
We've been way too divisive over this, Chef. Maybe we can come up with a- compromise flag—something that everybody can be happy with.
The last three are getting away, shoot 'em Ned. 
I have to admit it, that is a lot nicer.
Oho, it was awful!  Cow after cow taking its own life, and we could do nothing to stop them! Oh, God!
Boys, looky there. That there's a Rocky Mountain black bear …one of the few remaining of its kind. Isn't it beautiful… By God, it's coming right for us! 
'Loving You'? That's perfect! Come on Ned, Middle Park's gonna get a Halftime show they'll never forget.
Well, come on, guys. If I'm not mistaken, we still have someone to duct-tape to the flagpole!
Oh my God!  Well, don't worry boys, Uncle Jimbo is on the case.  Buckle your seat belt, Ned.
Not that sure. I think we better come up with a backup plan. Uhh, let's see here. Hey, bookie! Wha- what's the halftime show gonna be?
We cannot change the South Park flag, Mayor!
Okay, that's enough o' that! You cows need to dis-perse!  All right, bad cows! Do you hear me? Bad cows!  All right, Ned. You're gonna have to bust out the whip!
Stay out of this, Gerald! Some men care about what their wives are doing!
I guess we learned our lesson: you can't fight rich folk; they're just too powerful.
That's right, Stanley. Animals are much easier to shoot in the morning.
All right, looks like we'll have to apply the Oppenheimer technique with Tweek here. 
They've been goin' at it for a good thirty minutes.
Give me some more s'more schnapps! I'm gonna be sick.  Blouach.
All right, everyone get in and get a seal on that door!
Hey, now that's not true. My shoes don't say I pound butt.
What are we gonna do, Mayor? This killer is on the loose!
Oh, why can't we all live at the mall?!
Hwell... maybe a little. But we're all a little gay.
All right! Well, I think we got what we wanted.
Huh, cut it out, Ned! That's just disgusting!
Hey, Ned. Remember that time when we got the anonymous tip back in 'Nam?
He casually dropped this on his way out! 
You know what? I'll bet we could take Topeka right now and clear them all around!
Well, Jesus, I definitely learned my lesson. Neeever bet on evil, 'cause when you d- Ned! Look, there's a rare duck-billed platypus!  Ih-it's comin' right for us! 
There there Randy, you... You gave it your best shot.
Soon it was all on just me and Ned to win the war for America.
Hi, I'm Jimbo Kern, and this here is Ned. Say hi, Ned.
Careful with those, now, those are dangerous.  Point 'em away from your eyes, now.
Don't do it, Randy. If Muhammad is seen, we could get bombed.
Eric! Are you training that pony to please you?!
Ned, nobody's gonna vote for our side if it's the side those KKK members are on. Come on, we gotta put a stop to them.
Hey, now. Everything I told you boys about the war actually happened.
You know, Loving you is easy 'cause you're beautiful doo-nn-doo-nn-doo-doo... Aaaaah
Did you see that?! I was imperiled by that ferocious, charging buck.
Broflovski, did you put this crap on my windshield?! 
Well can't we stop them? Let's call the bank.
