And now, to clarify how the reenactment should unfold, let's bring up our master historian, Grandpa Marvin Marsh,  the only man old enough to have actually seen the Civil War... reenactment of 1924.
Don't y'all worry, you just wait till halftime, hehe.
Welluh, that sounds great. I'm gonna get some s'more schnapps. You want anything?
I just came from Will Patterson's house! His mother got three packages from Amazon! And the UPS guy told her what he'd like to do to her!
Okay, that's enough o' that! You cows need to dis-perse!  All right, bad cows! Do you hear me? Bad cows!  All right, Ned. You're gonna have to bust out the whip!
Get around th' side there, Ned. I can't get a shot in from here.
No siree. I'm telling you, I got the line. My nephew Stan is the best quarterback the school has ever seen. I guarantee they'll beat the spread.
This is about history, kids.  If you don't have respect for your past, then you can never expect to- BIRD!  -then you can never expect to have a future. Nowadays, everyone wants to change mascots and flags because they're not  "politically correct." Well, where does it end? I mean, people are gonna start sayin' that the Denver Broncos are offensive to horses. And then we'll have to- a SQUIRREL!  And then we'll have to change everything, and pretty soon all our history will be forgotten. But to REALLY understand the South Park's flag's importance, you need to know about South Park's history. Ned here's a big history buff, and he can tell you the whole story. Ned?
Come on! We gotta buy more duct tape.
Wait, there's a ram! It's coming right for us!  Nice shootin' Kenny. Here, you need a bigger gun.
Hey Ned, hand me that gin.  You boys want to tie one on?
Well, be sure to join us next time. Until then...
We're so glad you spent your time with us
While we slaughtered our way through nature's guts
Come again and stay a while
We'll kill a lot more living things to make them bleed
What a beautiful morning for fishing. There's one, there's a fish right there! 
Comin' up next, we're gonna drop some napalm on an unsuspecting family of beavers. And also, try to thin out the numbers of some endangered species.
I hope so, Mayor. I hope so. Uhud I need a cold beer and a burger.  What's all the ruckus over there? 
Oh. Well, does Mr. Denkins know you're usin' his pony? He shoots trespassers on sight, you know.
Well, it appears as though a lot of you "skeptics" thought that the film we showed of the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka was a fake. That you say it didn't harm anybody. Well, it just so happens that we just received another film from another anonymous viewer.  Roll it!  There you go! Proof that not only is this frog real, but it is doing harm to the people of South Park as we speak!
Boy. You must really wanna take to to those Orange County kids now, huh, Stan?
No, no, see, you've gotta be IN a state with a "stand your ground" law, like Florida.
Would this be for hunting, home protection, or other?
Well, Ned, looks like we missed Fourth of July again.
No, young hunter. I mean, what do you see? You must learn all you can about your kill.
Well, how do you like that? Bottle rockets saved the Fourth of July!
Dumb-ass! You've got to keep your eyes away from him!  Stay down. Ned, you take flight position; I'll try and keep it turned away from you.
You boys go make me proud now and win that debate- Chris Peterson!  God-damnit, we missed him again!
Yeah, I've been reenacting this war for 22 years now. And for 22 years us Confederate reenactors have had to spend the evening being ridiculed and made fun of by the Union reenactors! Well, I'm sick of it!
Hold on, I'll get my shotgun! Ned! Ned, come on!  Where did it go?
Yeah! The last thing these people want is a bleedin'-heart rock protest song!
Aw, he'll be fine. I'll just take him home and show him some good hard-core porn, he'll snap right out of it. Won't you, Ned? 
Shhh, not so loud. Now that there's just a technicality.
It's him! The Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka. He's right over there on that rock.
Ned, I think I can say without any doubt that that was the longest drinking binge we've ever had.
You see boys, the Democrats have passed a lot of laws trying to stop us from hunting.
Listen, everybody. We did what we had to in there.
Ey, that's not fair! You can't let home-schooled kids into a public-school spelling bee!
Damnit Ned, doesn't that thing have a volume control?
We've been way too divisive over this, Chef. Maybe we can come up with a- compromise flag—something that everybody can be happy with.
How do you tell him? "Hey Gerald, Sorry, but the UPS man is bangin' your wife." It's really none of our business.
Chef, what about the baseball team, the Cleveland Indians, huh? Should they change their name because it's racist?
Lincoln and Davis signed the treaty, General. The war is over.
But then you had us do all that for nothin'. Don't you see: If you get rich sellin' these homes, then there will still be rich people in South Park.
Yeah. Next house we'll do a capital T, to show 'em we REALLY mean business!
You're in luck! Ned here used to be the state champion until a grenade blew his arm off.
Aw, nuts! Come on, Ned, this ain't no whore house, it's a hor-ROR house.
You can't shoot someone who threatens you just out on the street. Well unless of course you're in a state that has a "stand your ground" law.
Now that is a man who has eaten a lot of beef!
Did you see that?! I was imperiled by that ferocious, charging buck.
Hey. Where's she going? That's the wrong way, you stupid cow! 
And I say it's high time we kicked some ass! Who's with me?!
You can do it, kid! You can do it!
It's the boys! They've modified a bus to get us out of here!
Yes, now we're about to roll the film, but remember: if you look the Mexican staring frog in the eyes, you could go catatonic. We don't know if this applies to pictures of the frog or not, but who wants to take chances? So when we roll this film, be sure to look away.  Okay, roll the film, Tom.  Is it over? Okay, it's over.  Well, there you have it. Undeniable proof that the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka exists.
Hey, everybody, look who's here! The AFC Champion Denver Broncos! 
Well, sure, Vietnam was fun. But not like goin-to-the-circus fun, or fly-fishin-in-Montana fun. No, Vietnam was more like shovin' shards of broken glass up your ass and then sittin' in a tub of Tabasco sauce fun.
I uh... Well, okay, I might have embellished the truth a little, but that's different.
Well, son, I think you have a pretty stupid plan there.
Okay, everybody! It's time for the Running of the Cows! 
It shows how beautiful the innocence of a child really is. 
Well, come on everybody. We've got to get to the nearest bus station, quick.
Wait a minute! Where the hell is the short one?
Stan, some things you kill, and some things you don't. See?
Here you go.  Wow, those are great. Maybe I should go grab some beers, Ned. Ned, what- a-are you jackin' it?
That is the most insane thing I've ever seen. I can't believe those people are on our side. I mean, is our side that crazy?  Oh, hello, Chef. Big debate tomorrow, I guess.  Oh, Jesus, the robes! Chef, this isn't what it looks like. You've gotta listen to us!
Nonsense! Not with my nephew at quarterback. Right Stanley?
All right, looks like we'll have to apply the Oppenheimer technique with Tweek here. 
Well can't we stop them? Let's call the bank.
Everyone get your hybrid and meet at Dawson's! 
Soon it was all on just me and Ned to win the war for America.
'Loving You'? That's perfect! Come on Ned, Middle Park's gonna get a Halftime show they'll never forget.
Hold onto your butts.  Take that, you demon frog!  Ned, Ned? Can you hear me?  Quick! Somebody, call an ambulance! This man is catatonic!
Careful with those, now, those are dangerous.  Point 'em away from your eyes, now.
I'll tell you why. Because he's on drugs and worships the devil!
Good! Now kick his balls!  There, see? You've got him coughing up blood.
We shouldn't be fighting amongst ourselves, we should be uniting against metrophobes like these!
Yes?  Dammit! I got it wrong again! What's the answer again?  Holy smokes! What the hell is that?
Well, all right. Ned, get the Mayor on the phone, tell her that we... hoh yeah, he can't talk. All right, never mind, I'll do it.
Kyle, Kyle, he's our man. If he can't win it, I'm out 50 bucks.
Excuse me, Mayor, but I just received some news that you might all be interested in.  Our South Park Cows have just beaten the Washington dodgeball team, and are on their way to the world championship in China. 
We have to give in to their demands.
I hope you all realize what we might be facing here.  Our only option might be to... eat each other to stay alive. 
You see… Ned picked up the grenade and… BOOM, blasted his arm clear off. We spent three hours looking for that damn arm, but it was never to be found. Some say it's still crawling around to this day.
What gives them the right to shoot down our drones?!
...And with that, let's all go to Tamarack Hill and put on a good show!
Alright, then.  Wait, why the hell are you trainin' Denkins' pony to bite off someone's penis?
Now, Tweek, boxing is a Man sport. There is nothing in the world more Man than boxing. It is Man at his most Man. So when you spar with Ned here, just dig deep into that most Man part of you.
Oho, it was awful!  Cow after cow taking its own life, and we could do nothing to stop them! Oh, God!
Hell, everything's legal in México. It's the American way. 
I have to admit it, that is a lot nicer.
Calm down, soldier! We need every person here to keep his head! Barbrady, fetch some straws.
Boys, looky there. That there's a Rocky Mountain black bear …one of the few remaining of its kind. Isn't it beautiful… By God, it's coming right for us! 
So, whatever side we're on is the side that's gonna lose, right?
They've been goin' at it for a good thirty minutes.
You guys shoulda seen the crap Randy took last night! It was honestly, the biggest crap anyone has ever taken. Ever.
How come you're not blowin' things up? It's summer.
It's true, she did. Hu-I'm such a tool.
Hi, I'm Jimbo Kern, and this here is Ned. Say hi, Ned.
Huh? Uh hey now, uh. We don't want your support. We're not racists; this is about history.
They say we can't shoot certain animals anymore, unless they're posing an immediate threat. Therefore, before we shoot somethin', we have to say 'It's coming right for us.'
Okay, everybody, okay. Settle down. Now I know you're all anxious to get to the Running of the Cows, BUT, let me remind you: those brave souls who have decided to run against the cows through town do so at their own risk. I don't think I have to remind you that three people died in last year's Running of the Cows.  With that said, let's rock and roll!  Everybody ready to run?  Release the cows!  They're loose! 
Well, we can all be friends now.  Come on, Randy. Have some s'more schnapps. 
Don't do it, Randy. If Muhammad is seen, we could get bombed.
Ah I hate when the Mayor uses Christmas for her own political agenda.  Light the damn tree!
Lookie, Ned, there's some deers!  Quick, Ned! Thin out their numbers!
All o' you men. You may have lost in the Union today, but join us now and win back your pride!
Well,  we're not going anywhere for a loong time.
Heh, I don't think I've ever seen a kid as cool as you Kenny. I'm making you... my honorary nephew.
Oh, no, I must have picked up the Irish model by mistake.
I'm sorry, Stan. I was just trying to tell a good story. I never meant for you boys to get in trouble.
All right, damn it! We're not going to stand for this! Now, whoever stole our golden cow memorial, we're gonna find you and kill you!  Aall right, uhow about this? Whoever took the sacred cow, just please return 'im, and there'll be no questions asked.  Wait a minute. You folks from out of town. You're the only ones with a reason to take our beloved cow memorial! 
Hey Randy, can I borrow your uh...  What the hell are they doing?
Alright, Ned. Now we're coming up to the American border. They can't know that we have fireworks in the trunk. Just let me do the talking.  I guess that goes without saying, doesn't it? 
Now remember, everybody: for a good reenactment we've got to pretend down to the last detail that we're really in the Civil War. So when the North wins, all of us on the Confederate side should act all bummed and depressed. 
Um, sure.  What the-? Ey, where's the s'more schnapps?
The last three are getting away, shoot 'em Ned. 
All right, that's fine! Because our war support songs will be a thousand times better!
Well-uh... I think I'll-uh uuduh-I think I left the oven on.
Hey, there's Cotswolds. Come on! Let's duct-tape him to the flagpole!
It is amazing what people can do under stress. Just look at the pyramids. Nobody knows how they built those, or who.
Oh, hell, I have to run home and get my broom!
To buy fireworks. Just 'cause some kid blew off his hands doesn't mean the rest of us have to suffer, now, does it?
I guess we learned our lesson: you can't fight rich folk; they're just too powerful.
Broflovski, did you put this crap on my windshield?! 
Yeah? Well, I don't think the bus station is too far from here.
--no longer works. So now, we only kill naimals to, quote, "thin out their numbers". If we don't hunt, then these animals will grow too big in number and they won't have enough food. So you see, we have to kill animals, or else they'll die.  Uhh... So roll the tape.  Here we are at Shafer's Crossing, lookin' for some animals.
Yeah, I just wanted to  try to set an example, you know?
Yeah. How many rich people does it take to screw in a light bulb? None! They can hire people to do it for them! 
Well, that does it! Let's go tell everyone from Jersey we don't want 'em here!
Stay out of this, Gerald! Some men care about what their wives are doing!
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't get too carried away now...
Hey, now that's not true. My shoes don't say I pound butt.
Uh Professor, we all just thought of somethin'. If everyone has their head buried by the person standing to their left, then who's gonna bury the last person's head?
Chef, I respect you very much, but you have to understand that this has been the South Park flag since some of our ancestors, like my great-grandfather, founded this land!
Well, I don't think those are problems  that some Tijuana bottle rockets can't solve!
How come they just let that Bono guy send a picture of his crap?
Alright, you want a rifle!  well, like this .22 caliber.  What is it you intend to shoot?
Aw, hell, uh I've done it too. With Cameron here. 
Well, here we are. Okay, each of you young 'uns take a gun, a beer and some smokes.
Don't feel too bad there, kid. I never knew who my father was either. I mean, I did know who he was and well, we had some great times together in huntin' and fishin' whe-well, hell, you know what I mean. 
There it is!  Hey, hey! I saw it first! I get the first shot!  Here, turkey turkey. 
Alright, here's the plan. All we gotta do is volunteer to chaperone the dance tomorrow. 
Alright, Ned. We've got to be careful. These are really evil men we're dealing with.
Well, I tell you what: we may not have Elway this year, but Brister won every game he started in last year.
What the hell's wrong with you? Can't you have a little alcohol?  Christ, look at that little bastard go!  Now you see that Stan? Now, now that is a dirty little bastard!
Hey, Ned! A package came for you today from Voice Box Express.
Hey, government! You can't ignore our anguished cries anymore! You hear that?! You Government?! 
Ey, General, he's reenacting Jefferson Davis! You can't talk that way to a superior officer!
Ned, how the hell could you lose your voice box?!  I can't hear you, Ned. You don't have a trachea. You smoked too much and you had it removed. And then you drank too much and you lost your god-damned voice box, Ned!
Nice plan, kid, except there's one giant flaw. That hippie crowd is massive! How the hell are we supposed to get through it and reach the stage?
See now with a "stand your ground" law, you could legally shoot somebody that's threatening you whether they're in your house or not.
Oh, why can't we all live at the mall?!
Come on Ned, we gotta get our asses to the bookie.
You know, Loving you is easy 'cause you're beautiful doo-nn-doo-nn-doo-doo... Aaaaah
And you saw it here, on The Jimbo and Ned Show.
Eric! Are you training that pony to please you?!
Ned, nobody's gonna vote for our side if it's the side those KKK members are on. Come on, we gotta put a stop to them.
Man, it is about to get crazy up in here.
That's the last of it! We're out of ammo!
Atta boy! Now quick, get him again while he's down! 
Damn! Damn! I always get that question wrong!
Don't worry Mrs. Cartman, we'll take good care of him. I brought my old war buddy Ned to keep things safe.
You little bastard, you cost me fifty bucks.  Why don't you run away and join the circus, you stupid little son of a bitch?! Aaargh!
You boys don't understand. Ned was so freaked out by the idea of the Mexican staring frog that he must have sent himself into a deep coma.
But Kenny's dead now, Stan, and you're always going to be my nephew. And you can't just kill anything. You understand?
I don't have to remind you just how important this game is to us South Park Alumni.
All right! Well, I think we got what we wanted.
There's a murderer free in South Park. We have to find out who it is before they kill again.
Holy crap, Ned! That's the biggest Goddamned deer I have ever seen!
Hey Ned, look what I bought you! A new voice box!  You want it? You want it? Yeah! Do you? Yeah! You want it? All right, here you go.  Well, try it out!
Wow, look at that! The entire state of South Carolina showed up! 
Uh, well, he couldn't have gone far, unless something drug him off.
Ned, look.  They've got Enrique on their sideline, and it looks like that bomb's still attached.
Oh my God!  Well, don't worry boys, Uncle Jimbo is on the case.  Buckle your seat belt, Ned.
These look like its tracks. He must have gone this way. Ned, prepare some HK-12 and some plasticine. I'll bet that sucker's headed for a higher elevation. The higher up it- BIRD!!  The higher up it goes, the better it can breathe.
That's the spirit boys, let's get that testosterone flowin'.
What the hell is this trench doing here?!? We can't get across!
Well, I guess uh Fort Sumter in South Carolina. That's where the Civil War really escalated.
Well, you should be fine so long as the person breaks into your house and is an immediate threat to you.
Hey, Ned. Remember that time when we got the anonymous tip back in 'Nam?
Alrighty then! May I suggest a Stratford 12mm? Here, try it on!  That looks really nice on you. The lacquered black really matches your eyes.
Ah hell, I guess we better go look for him. Ned, we got to cut it short. Fire out the 12-20!  Well, I think that's about the limit for our fishing permit.
We cannot change the South Park flag, Mayor!
Alright. So far, everybody has a long piece of straw. We'll keep drawing.  Whew.
Dammit, Barbrady! When you draw straws, you're supposed to have one of them short! That's how you decide who loses!
Yeah, it's almost like something funny's going on.  Christ, Ned, what'd you have for breakfast.
The jakovasaurs would have gone extinct if we hadn't interfered. Because their particular form of life simply wasn't practical.
..."but Ponyboy was beat up pretty bad. He kept saying, 'stay gold.'"  Aw, Ned. If you can hear me, y-you've got to snap out of it, 'cause if you don't, uh-I'll never forgive myself.  Aw, Stanley, he's gone! My only friend in the world is gone!
Hello, fellow hunters. Have we got a show for you today.  The Mexican staring frog is sunning itself on a rock directly behind us.  We've got to take the frog by surprise. I'm gonna create a diversion using this incendiary device  while Ned will ambush him from the rear.  Now, Ned! He's not looking!  Quick, Ned, hit him with the shotgun! Now, Ned!  Ned. Ne-ed?  Oh, no!  Come on, Ned, buddy, snap out of it!  Come back to me, buddy.
Ned, I'm starting to think that maybe history ain't worth defendin' sometimes.
Well we don't know what else to do, Mayor!
Because Cotswolds is gonna to live there. And when he shows up, we all grab him, bring him out here, and duct-tape him to the flagpole!
You just keep all your flag burnin' and your hippie-rock protest songs on YOUR side o' the town!
Aw, why don't you go to a Grateful Dead concert? 
Well, that does it! All this week, Ned and I will be--
You hear that, cows? You're surrounded! There's no way out!
Goddamnit Ned, I just got that van. How the hell are we supposed to get home?
No nephew of mine is gonna be a tree hugger.
Hey, aren't those the people we at first thought took the wooden cow?
I remember I had just gotten off the Ferris wheel.
Holy crow. Look, boys! A real live wild turkey!  It's tryin' to outsmart us! Come on, fellas! 
Sounds like it ran into the ostrich trap!  Sshh. Now keep quiet. All right. I'm gonna turn my flashlight on. It may get startled, so be ready. 
Aghh! What the hell are you doing? I almost looked right at it!
Quick, Ned! This is our chance! The Hummer's outside!
Look, if you wanna get revenge on somebody, you've gotta think like a hunter. 
Well you can come to our side of town to use the post office and we can go to your side to use the grocery store.
What are we gonna do, Mayor? This killer is on the loose!
Well, uh I guhess one little cheers is in order.
What the hell are you talking about, you don't want to shoot the bunny? You're babbling, you're not making any sense, you're hysterical.
Come on everybody, let's do the Drunken Barn Dance! 
Randy! Randy, you've got to get out of here! If they just trample this park, we'll be trapped! It's too dangerous!
Well Chef, you're welcome to stay with me until you buy another house.
We're all with you, Jesus! We put every dime we have on you beatin' that Dark Prince. 
Pass me some more cocoa, will you, Ned?
Well, come on, guys. If I'm not mistaken, we still have someone to duct-tape to the flagpole!
Ohho, it's a deer. Looks like about a .46 gauge, Ned. It's coming right for us!  
We followed blindly for thousands of years and we think the least God can do is show up for New Year's Eve 1999!
That's right, Jesus. No respect for their elders. As some of you may know, I host a local show on hunting.  Thanks. We've been hunting the Mexican staring frog for a week based on some video footage we received from a viewer. Well, it turns out that these kids faked the footage!
Here's the same gun, with a wood finish.
All right, everyone get in and get a seal on that door!
Come on, Ned! We've got to get our asses to the bookie! 
That's as far as most of us got. You think we have a shot at beating the spread against Middle Park this year?
This one's yours Stan.  It's coming right for us.
I remember back in the day, RICH folk weren't alLOWED in South Park! Now thery're movin' here in droves!
There he is! Kill him! Kill him!  Oh, wait, that's not him. 
Well boys, I'm sorry I got you all killed. 
Well, Jesus, I definitely learned my lesson. Neeever bet on evil, 'cause when you d- Ned! Look, there's a rare duck-billed platypus!  Ih-it's comin' right for us! 
Damn it Stan, you shouldn't have done that!
The kindergarten teacher is suspected of having sex with a student
We just encourage them to find someplace better.
I'm also very proud to announce that this year's alcohol sponsor, Jagermin's S'more-flavored Schnapps, the schnapps with the delightful taste of s'mores.
He casually dropped this on his way out! 
Well, what are we waitin' for? Let's kill it! 
Arrgh-ha-ha-ha! Now, isn't that great?  We have a terrific show for you today: we're gonna kill some elk, and we're gonna kill some mountain goats. Now, the new law passed by Colorado legislature, which Ned and I call "Pussy Law #4", states that we can no longer kill animals in defense.
("PUSSY LAW #4"
NO ANIMAL SHALL BE HARMED,
EVEN IN SELF DEFENSE, UNLESS
SPECIFIC LICENSE AND SEASON IS
IN ORDER. SELF DEFENSE CAN ONLY
BE JUSTIFIED BY EXTREME, PROVABLE
PERIL AND OR DOCUMENTED VISIBLE
BODILY HARM.)
In other words, our old line of, "It's comin' right for us"--
Yeah, I wanted to order that theft alarm for my IT.
Hey! This window is shot out, too! That means the killer was not someone in this room!
Sure! When it comes to spelling bees, always bet on the Jew.
My best friend is a vegetable, and I'm gonna be the laughingstock of South Park!
Would you look at that, Ned? That's a Tijuana bottle rocket! These babies have enough power to blast a fiery hole right through the ozone.
He's right! The turd could have been put there to cover up 9/11!
Huh, cut it out, Ned! That's just disgusting!
Now boys, boys, ah-I need to get serious for a minute. I want you to understand a few basic rules of hunting, since this is your first time. First, don't ever walk with your gun unless the safety's on. Second, don't shoot anything that looks human, and third, never spill your beer in the bullet chamber.
What?!  Is that a challenge?! I'll bet we can!
Give you a taste of your own medicine, you little fibber!
That's a lot of lead, Mr. Director. I don't eat pretty, but if a few of us must die so the rest can stay alive, so be it.
Oh, lookie who's here. My little nephew Stanley.  So, you're interested in your Uncle Jimbo's big TV show, huh?
This year is a very special Cow Days because we are revealing our all-new Cow Memorial!  Which will live forever in South Park from this day forth. Release the curtain! 
Pussies?! Oh yeah?! Men! It's time to show the world what the Confederate Army has got! We're gonna take Topeka once and for all!
Yepper, but I think we've learned some important lessons Ned I think that- 
This is all Stan's fault! He wrote that gay little song and got us to drive those damned hybrids!
Well, it's snowing black ash, but what the hell. 
Ned, it's our job to get these to children all over America for the Fourth of July.  We'll be like Santa Claus on Christmas morning.
Aw, thank God you're alright, kid.  It was an accident, I swear. Uh, is there any way we can make it up to you?
What we'll have to do here Carl is put a trigger on that bomb that makes it go off at a specific moment during halftime.
Let's get back to base camp. We can ride the log ride before it closes! 
So why don't we all say that we want the flag changed. That way, most folks'll vote to keep it the way it is.
There there Randy, you... You gave it your best shot.
--risking life and limb as we go on location to hunt the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka. Join us, won't ya?
Yeah. You know, uh I suddenly found myself on the side of Klan members. I've never had anything against blacks, Chef.
Well, Ned, looks like we'll have to use the old Indian fire trick.
We have to take 'em out, Ned! At all costs! Die, you red commie bastards! 
Dear God, they're bigger than I ever imagined!
Boy, we really got the President by the balls. Good thing you have that videotape of him and Marisa Tomei.
Hey Ned, why don't you whip out the ol' cancer kazoo? Let's do a little song.
That sure was a great hunting trip. We saved those deer from extinction.
Step 1: Find someone's weakness. Step 2: Exploit that weakness.
Tough love, Mr. Mackey. We're taking you to rehab.
Well Ned, we always kidnapped Middle Park's mascot. But this year we're gonna booby-trap it instead.  And when John Stamos' older brother hits that high F in Loving You, Boom!  No more Middle Park players. 
That's right, Stanley. Animals are much easier to shoot in the morning.
Ned, we are going to get our asses kicked.
Look, we have to accept the fact that most people in the world hate us, right?
Well, enough of the lectures. let's get to boxing. 
Well, that's not fair! I should be able to say "fag". 
Alrighty everyone. We just have a few things to go over before we head out to the reenactment battlefield.  First of all, I have great news. There are over 200 folks from around the state that have come to see this year's reenactment, and that's the best turnout ever!
