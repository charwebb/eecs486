Ned, how the hell could you lose your voice box?!  I can't hear you, Ned. You don't have a trachea. You smoked too much and you had it removed. And then you drank too much and you lost your god-damned voice box, Ned!

...And with that, let's all go to Tamarack Hill and put on a good show!

Old fool went down to the OC to try to reason with the other team, and he got served up somethin' fierce.

There he is! Kill him! Kill him!  Oh, wait, that's not him. 

Oh. I don't take kindly to rich folk. Neither does Ned.

Let's get back to base camp. We can ride the log ride before it closes! 

We shouldn't be fighting amongst ourselves, we should be uniting against metrophobes like these!

Okay, that's enough o' that! You cows need to dis-perse!  All right, bad cows! Do you hear me? Bad cows!  All right, Ned. You're gonna have to bust out the whip!

Yeah. How many rich people does it take to screw in a light bulb? None! They can hire people to do it for them! 

There it is!  Hey, hey! I saw it first! I get the first shot!  Here, turkey turkey. 

All o' you men. You may have lost in the Union today, but join us now and win back your pride!

Yeah, I wanted to order that theft alarm for my IT.

Hwell... maybe a little. But we're all a little gay.

Um, sure.  What the-? Ey, where's the s'more schnapps?

Tough love, Mr. Mackey. We're taking you to rehab.

I don't have to remind you just how important this game is to us South Park Alumni.

Whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't get too carried away now...

Well, be sure to join us next time. Until then...
We're so glad you spent your time with us
While we slaughtered our way through nature's guts
Come again and stay a while
We'll kill a lot more living things to make them bleed

Don't feel too bad there, kid. I never knew who my father was either. I mean, I did know who he was and well, we had some great times together in huntin' and fishin' whe-well, hell, you know what I mean. 

Ohho, it's a deer. Looks like about a .46 gauge, Ned. It's coming right for us!  

Well, we'll be doing plenty of drinking on this trip; After all, hunting sober is like … fishing … sober. It sure will be nice to get out of the city for a while, away from civilization.

See now with a "stand your ground" law, you could legally shoot somebody that's threatening you whether they're in your house or not.

Shhh, not so loud. Now that there's just a technicality.

What gives them the right to shoot down our drones?!

Come on! We gotta buy more duct tape.

You know, Loving you is easy 'cause you're beautiful doo-nn-doo-nn-doo-doo... Aaaaah

Holy crap, Ned! That's the biggest Goddamned deer I have ever seen!

Well, it's snowing black ash, but what the hell. 

'Loving You'? That's perfect! Come on Ned, Middle Park's gonna get a Halftime show they'll never forget.

Now, Tweek, boxing is a Man sport. There is nothing in the world more Man than boxing. It is Man at his most Man. So when you spar with Ned here, just dig deep into that most Man part of you.

Alrighty everyone.  We're going to do the entire reenactment again, because of some confusion over the bell. Now, I know you're just trying to help Eric, but we have to let the Union capture the bell this time.

Alright, Ned. Now we're coming up to the American border. They can't know that we have fireworks in the trunk. Just let me do the talking.  I guess that goes without saying, doesn't it? 

It's him! The Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka. He's right over there on that rock.

Would this be for hunting, home protection, or other?

Huh? Uh hey now, uh. We don't want your support. We're not racists; this is about history.

We just encourage them to find someplace better.

Huh, cut it out, Ned! That's just disgusting!

What we'll have to do here Carl is put a trigger on that bomb that makes it go off at a specific moment during halftime.

Pass me some more cocoa, will you, Ned?

This one's yours Stan.  It's coming right for us.

My best friend is a vegetable, and I'm gonna be the laughingstock of South Park!

No nephew of mine is gonna be a tree hugger.

Hey, there's Cotswolds. Come on! Let's duct-tape him to the flagpole!

Come on Ned, we gotta get our asses to the bookie.

Yeah? Well, I don't think the bus station is too far from here.

We have to give in to their demands.

Aw, nuts! Come on, Ned, this ain't no whore house, it's a hor-ROR house.

What?! Give me those!  Holy crow, he's right, Ned! Mrs. Tenorman's lettin' the twins out!

I'm sorry, Stan. I was just trying to tell a good story. I never meant for you boys to get in trouble.

Oh, why can't we all live at the mall?!

Ah I hate when the Mayor uses Christmas for her own political agenda.  Light the damn tree!

But Kenny's dead now, Stan, and you're always going to be my nephew. And you can't just kill anything. You understand?

Boy, we really got the President by the balls. Good thing you have that videotape of him and Marisa Tomei.

Well, come on, guys. If I'm not mistaken, we still have someone to duct-tape to the flagpole!

Damnit Ned, doesn't that thing have a volume control?

Dear God, they're bigger than I ever imagined!

The jakovasaurs would have gone extinct if we hadn't interfered. Because their particular form of life simply wasn't practical.

Hold onto your butts.  Take that, you demon frog!  Ned, Ned? Can you hear me?  Quick! Somebody, call an ambulance! This man is catatonic!

Wait a minute! Where the hell is the short one?

Aw, look at 'em, Ned. Look how much happiness a little firepower can bring to a child.

W-hell, naturally you could cross the line for that. Just like ...we could cross the line for hardware, supplies, gas, and pharmaceutical needs.

How come you're not blowin' things up? It's summer.

Hey Randy, can I borrow your uh...  What the hell are they doing?

Oh, lookie who's here. My little nephew Stanley.  So, you're interested in your Uncle Jimbo's big TV show, huh?

Uh Professor, we all just thought of somethin'. If everyone has their head buried by the person standing to their left, then who's gonna bury the last person's head?

Hey, look out son, that's dangerous. You're gonna spill your beer.

What?!  Is that a challenge?! I'll bet we can!

Goddamnit Ned, I just got that van. How the hell are we supposed to get home?

Dammit! Those poor kids must have been so disappointed to have nothin' but them stupid wussy snakes to light.

This year is a very special Cow Days because we are revealing our all-new Cow Memorial!  Which will live forever in South Park from this day forth. Release the curtain! 

Well, that's not fair! I should be able to say "fag". 

Well Chef, you're welcome to stay with me until you buy another house.

Aw, why don't you go to a Grateful Dead concert? 

Boy. You must really wanna take to to those Orange County kids now, huh, Stan?

Hey, Ned. Remember that time when we got the anonymous tip back in 'Nam?

What the hell is this trench doing here?!? We can't get across!

It's true, she did. Hu-I'm such a tool.

Welcome, hunters. Boy, have we got a show for you today! We have just received a tape from another viewer who filmed the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka right here in South Park.

You see boys, the Democrats have passed a lot of laws trying to stop us from hunting.

Alright, here's the plan. All we gotta do is volunteer to chaperone the dance tomorrow. 

Well can't we stop them? Let's call the bank.

What are we gonna do, Mayor? This killer is on the loose!

Uh, well, he couldn't have gone far, unless something drug him off.

Nice plan, kid, except there's one giant flaw. That hippie crowd is massive! How the hell are we supposed to get through it and reach the stage?

Ned, look.  They've got Enrique on their sideline, and it looks like that bomb's still attached.

Quick, Ned! This is our chance! The Hummer's outside!

Don't worry Mrs. Cartman, we'll take good care of him. I brought my old war buddy Ned to keep things safe.

They say we can't shoot certain animals anymore, unless they're posing an immediate threat. Therefore, before we shoot somethin', we have to say 'It's coming right for us.'

It's the boys! They've modified a bus to get us out of here!

Aw, thank God you're alright, kid.  It was an accident, I swear. Uh, is there any way we can make it up to you?

..."but Ponyboy was beat up pretty bad. He kept saying, 'stay gold.'"  Aw, Ned. If you can hear me, y-you've got to snap out of it, 'cause if you don't, uh-I'll never forgive myself.  Aw, Stanley, he's gone! My only friend in the world is gone!

No, no, see, you've gotta be IN a state with a "stand your ground" law, like Florida.

Wait, there's a ram! It's coming right for us!  Nice shootin' Kenny. Here, you need a bigger gun.

All right, that's fine! Because our war support songs will be a thousand times better!

--no longer works. So now, we only kill naimals to, quote, "thin out their numbers". If we don't hunt, then these animals will grow too big in number and they won't have enough food. So you see, we have to kill animals, or else they'll die.  Uhh... So roll the tape.  Here we are at Shafer's Crossing, lookin' for some animals.

You boys go make me proud now and win that debate- Chris Peterson!  God-damnit, we missed him again!

Hey, now that's not true. My shoes don't say I pound butt.

Stay out of this, Gerald! Some men care about what their wives are doing!

Here's the same gun, with a wood finish.

I hope so, Mayor. I hope so. Uhud I need a cold beer and a burger.  What's all the ruckus over there? 

All right, everyone get in and get a seal on that door!

All right, damn it! We're not going to stand for this! Now, whoever stole our golden cow memorial, we're gonna find you and kill you!  Aall right, uhow about this? Whoever took the sacred cow, just please return 'im, and there'll be no questions asked.  Wait a minute. You folks from out of town. You're the only ones with a reason to take our beloved cow memorial! 

Man, it is about to get crazy up in here.

Holy Crow! I've never seen anything like it!

You're in luck! Ned here used to be the state champion until a grenade blew his arm off.

Well, what are we waitin' for? Let's kill it! 

Yeah, I've been reenacting this war for 22 years now. And for 22 years us Confederate reenactors have had to spend the evening being ridiculed and made fun of by the Union reenactors! Well, I'm sick of it!

Wow, look at that! The entire state of South Carolina showed up! 

That's right, Jesus. No respect for their elders. As some of you may know, I host a local show on hunting.  Thanks. We've been hunting the Mexican staring frog for a week based on some video footage we received from a viewer. Well, it turns out that these kids faked the footage!

I hope you all realize what we might be facing here.  Our only option might be to... eat each other to stay alive. 

Hey Ned, why don't you whip out the ol' cancer kazoo? Let's do a little song.

Hey Ned, look what I bought you! A new voice box!  You want it? You want it? Yeah! Do you? Yeah! You want it? All right, here you go.  Well, try it out!

Buenos dias, mi amigo. Yo soy un Americano espectacularrr.

Aw, hell, uh I've done it too. With Cameron here. 

Well, how do you like that? Bottle rockets saved the Fourth of July!

Hi, I'm Jimbo Kern, and this here is Ned. Say hi, Ned.

Step 1: Find someone's weakness. Step 2: Exploit that weakness.

Hey, Ned! A package came for you today from Voice Box Express.

Yeah, I just wanted to  try to set an example, you know?

Everyone. Everyone, listen. FOX Network censored the image of Mohammad at the last minute.

Come on everybody, let's do the Drunken Barn Dance! 

Don't y'all worry, you just wait till halftime, hehe.

Damn it Stan, you shouldn't have done that!

Because Cotswolds is gonna to live there. And when he shows up, we all grab him, bring him out here, and duct-tape him to the flagpole!

You little bastard, you cost me fifty bucks.  Why don't you run away and join the circus, you stupid little son of a bitch?! Aaargh!

It is amazing what people can do under stress. Just look at the pyramids. Nobody knows how they built those, or who.

Oho, it was awful!  Cow after cow taking its own life, and we could do nothing to stop them! Oh, God!

Oh. Well, does Mr. Denkins know you're usin' his pony? He shoots trespassers on sight, you know.

Well-uh... I think I'll-uh uuduh-I think I left the oven on.

And I say it's high time we kicked some ass! Who's with me?!

Hey Ned, hand me that gin.  You boys want to tie one on?

Now that is a man who has eaten a lot of beef!

Chef, what about the baseball team, the Cleveland Indians, huh? Should they change their name because it's racist?

Give me some more s'more schnapps! I'm gonna be sick.  Blouach.

I'm also very proud to announce that this year's alcohol sponsor, Jagermin's S'more-flavored Schnapps, the schnapps with the delightful taste of s'mores.

Alrighty. Tweek, my little nephew Stanley has asked me to teach you the fine points of boxing.

Yeah, it was like wrestling a Louisiana alligator, this thing. Put up one hell of a fight. 

You boys don't understand. Ned was so freaked out by the idea of the Mexican staring frog that he must have sent himself into a deep coma.

All right! Well, I think we got what we wanted.

Alright, you want a rifle!  well, like this .22 caliber.  What is it you intend to shoot?

Don't do it, Randy. If Muhammad is seen, we could get bombed.

Broflovski, did you put this crap on my windshield?! 

I'll tell you why. Because he's on drugs and worships the devil!

Lookie, Ned, there's some deers!  Quick, Ned! Thin out their numbers!

The last three are getting away, shoot 'em Ned. 

The kindergarten teacher is suspected of having sex with a student

Hey, aren't those the people we at first thought took the wooden cow?

We have to take 'em out, Ned! At all costs! Die, you red commie bastards! 

Well you can come to our side of town to use the post office and we can go to your side to use the grocery store.

Boys, looky there. That there's a Rocky Mountain black bear …one of the few remaining of its kind. Isn't it beautiful… By God, it's coming right for us! 

Give 'em hell Stanley!  Jesus, now I haven't asked you for much, but all we need is one little score. Please? Please, Jesus?

Now boys, boys, ah-I need to get serious for a minute. I want you to understand a few basic rules of hunting, since this is your first time. First, don't ever walk with your gun unless the safety's on. Second, don't shoot anything that looks human, and third, never spill your beer in the bullet chamber.

Listen, everybody. We did what we had to in there.

What a beautiful morning for fishing. There's one, there's a fish right there! 

Well, sure. I mean, eh...  Well, no uh, I guess not.

--risking life and limb as we go on location to hunt the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka. Join us, won't ya?

Everyone get your hybrid and meet at Dawson's! 

That's a lot of lead, Mr. Director. I don't eat pretty, but if a few of us must die so the rest can stay alive, so be it.

Ned, we are going to get our asses kicked.

Oh my God!  Well, don't worry boys, Uncle Jimbo is on the case.  Buckle your seat belt, Ned.

Hey, now. Everything I told you boys about the war actually happened.

How come they just let that Bono guy send a picture of his crap?

Good! Now kick his balls!  There, see? You've got him coughing up blood.

And now, time for Jimbo's Mysteries of the Unexplained.  One of our loyal viewers from South Park sent us some 8mm film of what he claims to be the Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka. Now, as you all know, the Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka can supposedly kill you with one horrid gaze. If a person even so much as looks into the frog's eyes, they can be paralyzed, or even die. And this film proves that that frog may very well exist.  Now watch carefully, you're gonna see the Mexican staring frog.  There! There, did you see it? Roll that back again!  Now, freeze it!  Well, I'd like to know what all you skeptics have to say now! What do you think, Ned?

I uh... Well, okay, I might have embellished the truth a little, but that's different.

Alrighty then! May I suggest a Stratford 12mm? Here, try it on!  That looks really nice on you. The lacquered black really matches your eyes.

Would you look at that, Ned? That's a Tijuana bottle rocket! These babies have enough power to blast a fiery hole right through the ozone.

He's right! The turd could have been put there to cover up 9/11!

Nonsense! Not with my nephew at quarterback. Right Stanley?

Come on, Ned! We've got to get our asses to the bookie! 

So why don't we all say that we want the flag changed. That way, most folks'll vote to keep it the way it is.

Ned, nobody's gonna vote for our side if it's the side those KKK members are on. Come on, we gotta put a stop to them.

You can't shoot someone who threatens you just out on the street. Well unless of course you're in a state that has a "stand your ground" law.

Well, come on everybody. We've got to get to the nearest bus station, quick.

Holy crow. Look, boys! A real live wild turkey!  It's tryin' to outsmart us! Come on, fellas! 

Yes?  Dammit! I got it wrong again! What's the answer again?  Holy smokes! What the hell is that?

Why the hell not? We're at war.  Hey, you know those things are bad for your throat.

We followed blindly for thousands of years and we think the least God can do is show up for New Year's Eve 1999!

I have to admit it, that is a lot nicer.

Well, Ned, looks like we missed Fourth of July again.

No, young hunter. I mean, what do you see? You must learn all you can about your kill.

Well we don't know what else to do, Mayor!

So, whatever side we're on is the side that's gonna lose, right?

Well boys, I'm sorry I got you all killed. 

I remember back in the day, RICH folk weren't alLOWED in South Park! Now thery're movin' here in droves!

Hey! This window is shot out, too! That means the killer was not someone in this room!

We'll give the storm another hour. After that, we might have to eat again.

Well, I guess uh Fort Sumter in South Carolina. That's where the Civil War really escalated.

Excuse me, Mayor, but I just received some news that you might all be interested in.  Our South Park Cows have just beaten the Washington dodgeball team, and are on their way to the world championship in China. 

Well, that does it! All this week, Ned and I will be--

Kyle, Kyle, he's our man. If he can't win it, I'm out 50 bucks.

Well, sure, Vietnam was fun. But not like goin-to-the-circus fun, or fly-fishin-in-Montana fun. No, Vietnam was more like shovin' shards of broken glass up your ass and then sittin' in a tub of Tabasco sauce fun.

Yeah, it's almost like something funny's going on.  Christ, Ned, what'd you have for breakfast.

Ey, that's not fair! You can't let home-schooled kids into a public-school spelling bee!

Ned, it's our job to get these to children all over America for the Fourth of July.  We'll be like Santa Claus on Christmas morning.

Chef, I respect you very much, but you have to understand that this has been the South Park flag since some of our ancestors, like my great-grandfather, founded this land!

To buy fireworks. Just 'cause some kid blew off his hands doesn't mean the rest of us have to suffer, now, does it?

All right, looks like we'll have to apply the Oppenheimer technique with Tweek here. 

That's right, Stanley. Animals are much easier to shoot in the morning.

Welluh, that sounds great. I'm gonna get some s'more schnapps. You want anything?

You know what? I'll bet we could take Topeka right now and clear them all around!

Damn! Damn! I always get that question wrong!

Dumb-ass! You've got to keep your eyes away from him!  Stay down. Ned, you take flight position; I'll try and keep it turned away from you.

It shows how beautiful the innocence of a child really is. 

Well, you should be fine so long as the person breaks into your house and is an immediate threat to you.

He casually dropped this on his way out! 

I just came from Will Patterson's house! His mother got three packages from Amazon! And the UPS guy told her what he'd like to do to her!

You just keep all your flag burnin' and your hippie-rock protest songs on YOUR side o' the town!

You hear that, cows? You're surrounded! There's no way out!

What the hell are you talking about, you don't want to shoot the bunny? You're babbling, you're not making any sense, you're hysterical.

Get around th' side there, Ned. I can't get a shot in from here.

Did you see that?! I was imperiled by that ferocious, charging buck.

Alright, then.  Wait, why the hell are you trainin' Denkins' pony to bite off someone's penis?

How do you tell him? "Hey Gerald, Sorry, but the UPS man is bangin' your wife." It's really none of our business.

Holy crow! We could make a mint killing this thing.

No siree. I'm telling you, I got the line. My nephew Stan is the best quarterback the school has ever seen. I guarantee they'll beat the spread.

I want $500 on the South Park Cows.

Well, here we are. Okay, each of you young 'uns take a gun, a beer and some smokes.

Heh, I don't think I've ever seen a kid as cool as you Kenny. I'm making you... my honorary nephew.

Hold on, I'll get my shotgun! Ned! Ned, come on!  Where did it go?

Aw, Ned, don't burp-talk. That just sicks me out.

Hello there, fellow American. We're just anxious to get back to our homeland.

Soon it was all on just me and Ned to win the war for America.

Not that sure. I think we better come up with a backup plan. Uhh, let's see here. Hey, bookie! Wha- what's the halftime show gonna be?

There's a murderer free in South Park. We have to find out who it is before they kill again.

Well, John Stamos' older brother is all set to sing 'Loving You' during halftime. We want that bomb to go off when he hits that high F.

Well, that does it! Let's go tell everyone from Jersey we don't want 'em here!

Sounds like it ran into the ostrich trap!  Sshh. Now keep quiet. All right. I'm gonna turn my flashlight on. It may get startled, so be ready. 

Well Ned, we always kidnapped Middle Park's mascot. But this year we're gonna booby-trap it instead.  And when John Stamos' older brother hits that high F in Loving You, Boom!  No more Middle Park players. 

Yeah. You know, uh I suddenly found myself on the side of Klan members. I've never had anything against blacks, Chef.

Well, I don't think those are problems  that some Tijuana bottle rockets can't solve!

This is all Stan's fault! He wrote that gay little song and got us to drive those damned hybrids!

Well, it appears as though a lot of you "skeptics" thought that the film we showed of the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka was a fake. That you say it didn't harm anybody. Well, it just so happens that we just received another film from another anonymous viewer.  Roll it!  There you go! Proof that not only is this frog real, but it is doing harm to the people of South Park as we speak!

That's the last of it! We're out of ammo!

Well, enough of the lectures. let's get to boxing. 

We have to have the energy to make it through the night. We have to eat.

Yeah! The last thing these people want is a bleedin'-heart rock protest song!

What the hell's wrong with you? Can't you have a little alcohol?  Christ, look at that little bastard go!  Now you see that Stan? Now, now that is a dirty little bastard!

Hell, everything's legal in México. It's the American way. 

Aw, he'll be fine. I'll just take him home and show him some good hard-core porn, he'll snap right out of it. Won't you, Ned? 

Randy! Randy, you've got to get out of here! If they just trample this park, we'll be trapped! It's too dangerous!

Well, we can all be friends now.  Come on, Randy. Have some s'more schnapps. 

Yeah. Next house we'll do a capital T, to show 'em we REALLY mean business!

And you saw it here, on The Jimbo and Ned Show.

Hey. Where's she going? That's the wrong way, you stupid cow! 

Okay, everybody, okay. Settle down. Now I know you're all anxious to get to the Running of the Cows, BUT, let me remind you: those brave souls who have decided to run against the cows through town do so at their own risk. I don't think I have to remind you that three people died in last year's Running of the Cows.  With that said, let's rock and roll!  Everybody ready to run?  Release the cows!  They're loose! 

Ey, General, he's reenacting Jefferson Davis! You can't talk that way to a superior officer!

You guys shoulda seen the crap Randy took last night! It was honestly, the biggest crap anyone has ever taken. Ever.

But then you had us do all that for nothin'. Don't you see: If you get rich sellin' these homes, then there will still be rich people in South Park.

Well, Ned, looks like we'll have to use the old Indian fire trick.

That's the spirit boys, let's get that testosterone flowin'.

Ned, I think I can say without any doubt that that was the longest drinking binge we've ever had.

Alright. So far, everybody has a long piece of straw. We'll keep drawing.  Whew.

Give you a taste of your own medicine, you little fibber!

Damn, Ned, I've never seen that much cash.

That sure was a great hunting trip. We saved those deer from extinction.

Atta boy! Now quick, get him again while he's down! 

Comin' up next, we're gonna drop some napalm on an unsuspecting family of beavers. And also, try to thin out the numbers of some endangered species.

That's as far as most of us got. You think we have a shot at beating the spread against Middle Park this year?

Eric! Are you training that pony to please you?!

We're all with you, Jesus! We put every dime we have on you beatin' that Dark Prince. 

Look, if you wanna get revenge on somebody, you've gotta think like a hunter. 

We cannot change the South Park flag, Mayor!

And now, to clarify how the reenactment should unfold, let's bring up our master historian, Grandpa Marvin Marsh,  the only man old enough to have actually seen the Civil War... reenactment of 1924.

Now remember, everybody: for a good reenactment we've got to pretend down to the last detail that we're really in the Civil War. So when the North wins, all of us on the Confederate side should act all bummed and depressed. 

I remember I had just gotten off the Ferris wheel.

You can do it, kid! You can do it!

I guess we learned our lesson: you can't fight rich folk; they're just too powerful.

You see… Ned picked up the grenade and… BOOM, blasted his arm clear off. We spent three hours looking for that damn arm, but it was never to be found. Some say it's still crawling around to this day.

Pussies?! Oh yeah?! Men! It's time to show the world what the Confederate Army has got! We're gonna take Topeka once and for all!

Lincoln and Davis signed the treaty, General. The war is over.

Sure! When it comes to spelling bees, always bet on the Jew.

Calm down, soldier! We need every person here to keep his head! Barbrady, fetch some straws.

Careful with those, now, those are dangerous.  Point 'em away from your eyes, now.

There there Randy, you... You gave it your best shot.
