You've broken through their reality and they don't like it! Others deserve to know the truth! You see everything as shit, don't you?!  Where other people see fun movies and hear cool music, all you see and hear is shit! Am I right?
Watch that window, Puck!  Everyone, make sure this room isn't bugged!  Alright Stan, listen up! We don't have a lot of time! You've been told Asperger's is real! It isn't! It's just a front we use to stay hidden!
Alright, nice work Stan. Now comes the final step! You have to take out Duck President!
Yes. If we are to take back control from the evil forces, this little boy might be the key.
Or, robots from the future, whatever. The point is they need to keep everyone in a blissful state of ignorance.
But Stan, you have to take down the bad guys and go through a personal transformation, so that everything can go back to the way it was!
The world around us has all completely turned to shit. But aliens are putting out a brainwave that keeps most people seeing a false reality
We found a way to make it stop, Stan. Now are you interested? Or not?
Come on kid, there's not a lot of time left.
Or genetically altered humans, whatever, fuck you! All that matters is that you are the key to bringing this whole thing down. They know who we are, but they won't be expecting you! Are you ready to go back into the illusionary world you once lived in?
Stan, you have to convince people they're living in a world of illusion. We're sending you back in! 
Or aliens, or AI- things. Whatever, fuck you.
He's back!  Did you see the illusionary world again?
Alright, is he ready to be sent in?
Of course not! If there was a social development disease, you wouldn't call it Asperger's! That's just, that's just mean!  There's a big war going on out there, Stan, and we want you to join our fight to bring it all down!
Try and focus, Stan: we've found them! We know where the rock creatures are now.
How our we to know that they will let us go? Their offer could be a trap.
