Yes. It could be a laboratory disguised as a seagull.

Abort the sequence. 

I'm just about through playing with you boys! We're running out of time! You have to remember that song in its entirety! 

Thank you.

Mr. Marsh, you are on with all the world leaders. 

We've come to help you beat those Japs, boys!  There won't be anyone stopping this great ladder from being built today!  Alpha Team! Get that support structure up! Ciranom's Team! Get us photos and recon! 

Take me down below! I want to see the Internet for myself!

What's happening?

N, no. No, they're terrorists. They've been linked to Al Qaeda.

You're paid to think, Mr. Scientist! National security is our jub.  Gentlemen, we're going to Los Angeles!  I want that robot!

We were hoping to keep this quiet until it was all over, but, two days ago there was a terrorist attack on our imagination, and now our imaginations are running wild.

Are you ready, Kurt Russell?

There's no time! You need to come with us right now! 

They've been saying that for over forty years.

You boys need to come with us on a matter of national security.

Get him out of here!

Perhaps... there is consciousness in this robot. Maybe we as a society need to realize that artificial intelligence... is intelligence all the same, and we can learn from the robots. I think maybe one day we can all-  Hey, wait a minute, did, did that robot just fart?

Get out of there, Kurt Russell!

We aren't going to hurt your little friends. We just need information.

The world is now safe, thanks to you. And so now, as promised, here is Fleetwood Mac with Stevie Nicks!

Tell them that the government can't help them, but that we're very sorry. You know the plan, people! We can only evacuate citizens below this line! 

All right, that's enough! We've still got a lot of work to do, people! Its time to go in and get our imaginations under control!

Song? You didn't say anything about a song before.

Do you realize what's goin' on here?! Terrorists have attacked our imagination, and now our imaginations are running wild!  You'd better start remembering!

What?

Yeah. Say what you will about Mel Gibson, but the son of a bitch knows story structure. Get the videotape and do a background check on everyone in it!

There's been an abort, Mr. Gore.

Are those arm and leg locks secure?

Let me see that!  Why would you agree to suck someone's balls?

Sector 2? 

Sector 2? 

Not quite, but we have a new problem, Mr. President. Our recon team on the ladder just found new evidence of threats... from Saddam Hussein.

Don't worry, everyone. The government is here to save you. 

All right, let's get the cash put into boxes! 

The hell is going on?! 

Shhh! Tom! That's super-secret.

What's the matter?

What?

Sector Two?? 

Yes sir. And now we believe he's building weapons of mass destruction... in heaven.

The hell are you doing back here?!

That's it, isn't it?! Where do the Chinese keep this portal? How does it work?

What?!

Great job, troops! Once again we have killed our enemies!

Alright men! Grab your guns and your Bibles! We are going to get Miss Nicks back!

What? There was no drill ordered!

What??

Oh, and it, it smells, too!

We tried that! And Kurt Russell was raped by Christmas Critters!

All right, we might as well show it to them.  God-dammit, Tom.

What the hell are you doing?!

Wow, kid, you're a little faggot! 

What we want to know is how! We need to find a way into Imaginationland; you've been there! How did you do it?!

Yes, uh, I don't suppose you have any creative ideas how to fight these terrorists?

If I'm not mistaken, you're the one who bet that leprechauns weren't real. So why do you care what happens?

Later in the video we can see another imaginary hostage; this one reading a forced statement.

Alright, troops. We depart for Afghanistan in five minutes! Let's move out!

Terrorists have just attacked... our imagination.

Reverse the doorway! Send it back through!

All right, men. We don't know what you'll experience on the other side of this doorway, but it will most likely be really weird. If you reach our imagination, you are to take every step necessary to get it under control! Are you ready?

I want digital imaging and resource magnification done stat!  If that kid isn't imaginary, I want to know who he is, where he's from, and who his friends are!

All right! Let's do it! 

Good. I don't want that robot mobile until I know what it's capable of. All right, power it on. 

What I am about to tell you is highly classified. Two days ago, Muslim terrorists hijacked our imagination.  Frankly we don't know what their next move is or how to stop them.

Hey Marsh, get in here! 

Look out! 

We have no choice. Terrorists have attacked us where we are most vulnerable. There's no other option.  We have to nuke our imagination. 

According to all the tests and the data, the doorway should work, but... it never has.

Who the hell are you?!

Talk to me! What's going on?! 

Gentlemen, Ladies, we all know that we live in a time of uncertainty. The risk of an attack on American soil is higher than ever. Now, I believe we may be able to curb that risk. Two days ago our intelligence department came across this:  The AWESOM-O 4000. It is currently being used by Catamount Pictures to develop ideas for movies. Our sources say that in just one week it has come up with over one thousand movie ideas, eight hundred of which feature Adam Sandler. 

My God.

THAT WAS SARCASM. I was being sarcastic, you fucking idiot!

Why is it so easy for children to break into the Pentagon?!

So, you're saying we should bomb this moment, right now. Right! Johnson!

Come on, people, we're running out of time! We need all Army helicopters to the Southern states for evacuation NOW!

Ladies and gentlemen, I have dire news. Yesterday, at approximately 18:00 hours, terrorists successfully attacked... our imagination. 

What's wrong with it?

All right, enough! Keep that kid out of the way and let's get back to the nuking at hand!

What do you see in there?

Kurt Russell, can I get a comm check?

Sir, you must understand our fears. We must take out those facilities. We must...  bomb heaven!

Oh my God. Quick! Radio the helicopters!

Looks like those alien cops were right. Guess you should call them back now.

Prepare for launch...

All right, you two can go use the conference room. Go on, we have work to do here.

Good luck men! Godspeed!  What do we have?! Kurt Russell, can you hear me?

Yes, but you were in that one movie that was kinda like this. That gives you more experience than anybody. All right, here we go! Men! Forwaaard!

What?!

By attacking our imagination the terrorists have found our most vulnerable spot. And we've determined that the best course of action is to nuke our imagination.

Welcome to Afghanistan, troops! Get your gear ready and report to the barracks at o-nine hundred!

Stand by. Be ready to destroy it. 

Gentlemen, the terrorists appear to have complete control of our imagination. It's only a matter of time before... our imaginations start running wild.

Aw, see? Good job, Tom! Why don't you just tell them everything about Project X?!

Kurt Russell, what's going on?!

Fine. Kill that son of a bitch!

What? How can that be?

Dear Christ, they gave it memories, too.

Get him out of here.  Mr. Bay, can you think of any idea how to outwit these terrorists?

Ever since the Cold War, the U.S. Government has been working on a secret project to build a doorway into the imagination. It is called "Project Imagination Doorway."

Who made you, robot?

No- No. That's not an idea, that's a twist. We need ideas.

You signed an agreement, kid. We don't have time for this. Go on and do it.

Unethical? Let me explain something to you, Mr. Scientist! We understand that the robot is from Japan! That means that the Japanese have more of them! And if the Japanese fabricates one of them into a weapon before we do...

But, who would have programmed it to think it was human? The movie studio?

Alright men, check the ship. 

What?!

Gentlemen, the President is very angry that his Internet still isn't working.

I know you don't. Get him out of here!  Aaand being that we are all big Mel Gibson film fans, we thought maybe you could help us.

We've done it! The Taliban is destroyed!

Those aren't ideas, those are special effects!

Global warming didn't cause the Beaverton flood. We know now whose fault it is.  It was...  Crab people!

He's gone, little boy.

All right, Internet. What do you want from us?   If we've angered you somehow, let us know.  Try to communicate with it digitally again.  I've had it with this thing! Fire a warning shot at it! 

Who are you?...

Quick boys: how does the Imagination Song go?

No. If we got our hands on that robot, we could re-program it and turn it into a weapon!.
