Gentlemen, the President is very angry that his Internet still isn't working.
Speak in a language we can understand, Mr. Scientist!
Mr. Marsh, you are on with all the world leaders. 
What I am about to tell you is highly classified. Two days ago, Muslim terrorists hijacked our imagination.  Frankly we don't know what their next move is or how to stop them.
Kurt Russell, can I get a comm check?
Aw, see? Good job, Tom! Why don't you just tell them everything about Project X?!
Yes, uh, I don't suppose you have any creative ideas how to fight these terrorists?
All right, let's get the cash put into boxes! 
Perhaps... there is consciousness in this robot. Maybe we as a society need to realize that artificial intelligence... is intelligence all the same, and we can learn from the robots. I think maybe one day we can all-  Hey, wait a minute, did, did that robot just fart?
Ever since the Cold War, the U.S. Government has been working on a secret project to build a doorway into the imagination. It is called "Project Imagination Doorway."
Not quite, but we have a new problem, Mr. President. Our recon team on the ladder just found new evidence of threats... from Saddam Hussein.
Come on, people, we're running out of time! We need all Army helicopters to the Southern states for evacuation NOW!
But, who would have programmed it to think it was human? The movie studio?
Yes. It could be a laboratory disguised as a seagull.
We were hoping to keep this quiet until it was all over, but, two days ago there was a terrorist attack on our imagination, and now our imaginations are running wild.
Yeah. Say what you will about Mel Gibson, but the son of a bitch knows story structure. Get the videotape and do a background check on everyone in it!
If I'm not mistaken, you're the one who bet that leprechauns weren't real. So why do you care what happens?
I want digital imaging and resource magnification done stat!  If that kid isn't imaginary, I want to know who he is, where he's from, and who his friends are!
What we want to know is how! We need to find a way into Imaginationland; you've been there! How did you do it?!
We aren't going to hurt your little friends. We just need information.
They've been saying that for over forty years.
Alright men! Grab your guns and your Bibles! We are going to get Miss Nicks back!
I'm just about through playing with you boys! We're running out of time! You have to remember that song in its entirety! 
Take me down below! I want to see the Internet for myself!
Quick boys: how does the Imagination Song go?
There's no time! You need to come with us right now! 
Why is it so easy for children to break into the Pentagon?!
Ladies and gentlemen, I have dire news. Yesterday, at approximately 18:00 hours, terrorists successfully attacked... our imagination. 
You boys need to come with us on a matter of national security.
THAT WAS SARCASM. I was being sarcastic, you fucking idiot!
All right, men. We don't know what you'll experience on the other side of this doorway, but it will most likely be really weird. If you reach our imagination, you are to take every step necessary to get it under control! Are you ready?
I know you don't. Get him out of here!  Aaand being that we are all big Mel Gibson film fans, we thought maybe you could help us.
By attacking our imagination the terrorists have found our most vulnerable spot. And we've determined that the best course of action is to nuke our imagination.
Ask the squirrel what it knows about the terrorist attack.
No no! We need ideas how to stop the terrorists!
Good luck men! Godspeed!  What do we have?! Kurt Russell, can you hear me?
All right, people, I want this nuking done by the books.
Sir, you must understand our fears. We must take out those facilities. We must...  bomb heaven!
All right, enough! Keep that kid out of the way and let's get back to the nuking at hand!
Yes sir. And now we believe he's building weapons of mass destruction... in heaven.
That's why we've asked you here, M. Night Shyal-amalam.  The Sixth Sense, Signs, The Village, all very clever films. But can you use your amazing idea brain now to help us stop the terrorists?
Get him out of here.  Mr. Bay, can you think of any idea how to outwit these terrorists?
N, no. No, they're terrorists. They've been linked to Al Qaeda.
Yes, but you were in that one movie that was kinda like this. That gives you more experience than anybody. All right, here we go! Men! Forwaaard!
These surveillance photos were taken atop the ladder of what appears to be heaven.  Here we see what we believe to be a missile silo. And here  we see what looks like a laboratory of some sort for making chemical weapons.
We tried that! And Kurt Russell was raped by Christmas Critters!
Gentlemen, the terrorists appear to have complete control of our imagination. It's only a matter of time before... our imaginations start running wild.
So, you're saying we should bomb this moment, right now. Right! Johnson!
Great job, troops! Once again we have killed our enemies!
Do you realize what's goin' on here?! Terrorists have attacked our imagination, and now our imaginations are running wild!  You'd better start remembering!
We've intercepted this videotape the terrorists made for broadcast. Luckily we've kept it from being broadcast to the public. 
No- No. That's not an idea, that's a twist. We need ideas.
Do I have to remind you of your position?! Don't forget you have a duty to your country,  Mr. Scientist!! I want that robot's memories and consciousness E-RASED, so we can take it back to Washington! GOT IT?! 
All right, Internet. What do you want from us?   If we've angered you somehow, let us know.  Try to communicate with it digitally again.  I've had it with this thing! Fire a warning shot at it! 
According to all the tests and the data, the doorway should work, but... it never has.
Looks like those alien cops were right. Guess you should call them back now.
Don't worry, everyone. The government is here to save you. 
Later in the video we can see another imaginary hostage; this one reading a forced statement.
All right, you two can go use the conference room. Go on, we have work to do here.
That's it, isn't it?! Where do the Chinese keep this portal? How does it work?
Alright, troops. We depart for Afghanistan in five minutes! Let's move out!
Welcome to Afghanistan, troops! Get your gear ready and report to the barracks at o-nine hundred!
The world is now safe, thanks to you. And so now, as promised, here is Fleetwood Mac with Stevie Nicks!
No. If we got our hands on that robot, we could re-program it and turn it into a weapon!.
Let me see that!  Why would you agree to suck someone's balls?
All right, that's enough! We've still got a lot of work to do, people! Its time to go in and get our imaginations under control!
Global warming didn't cause the Beaverton flood. We know now whose fault it is.  It was...  Crab people!
You're paid to think, Mr. Scientist! National security is our jub.  Gentlemen, we're going to Los Angeles!  I want that robot!
We have no choice. Terrorists have attacked us where we are most vulnerable. There's no other option.  We have to nuke our imagination. 
You signed an agreement, kid. We don't have time for this. Go on and do it.
