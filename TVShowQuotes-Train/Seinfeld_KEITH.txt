Well, goodnight
Well lookit, the way I remember it (back to the grainy 8mm film parody) I was walking up the ramp. I was upset about the game. That's when you called me pretty boy. It ticked me off. I started to turn around to say something and as I turned around I saw Roger McDowell behind the bushes over by that gravely road.  Anyway he was talking to someone and they were talking to you. I tried to scream out but it was too late. It was already on its way.
Yeah, it was. [mind] Gosh, should I kiss her good night?
Nah, it's a brownstone. Three floors.
Would you mind if I gave her a call?
Yeah. Twelve pieces. <not clear> coffee table.
YOU said, "Nice game, pretty boy."
[mind] Come on I won the MVP in 79. I can do whatever I want to.
I've always wanted to do what you do.
Yeah.
I'd love some.
Well, I'm sorry you can't take that, no no no..
Well, how about this Friday?
Well then what are you doing with that racquet?
Look sweetheart I don't know who you are. I don't know what you're doing here. But...
UH, do you want to catch a movie this weekend? Have you seen JFK?
What's that?
(to Jerry) Do you perform anywhere in new York right now?
Hello.
or maybe just to get together for a cup of coffee
I love that bit about Jimmy Olson
You know, I live on the East Side.
I don't have to but I will.
No should I [continuity error in fact he SHOULD from the basketball game]
look guys, don't worry about it, I uh, Well I guess I better get going.
Yeah, it really was.
Goodnight. Oh, Jer, by the way, the woman we gave a ride to earlier tonight,
[mind] I'm Keith Hernandez.
Well, there was two outs, bottom of the tenth, we're one out away from losing the series.
Really, you know my mom's one quarter Cajun.
Ok guys, we gotta be careful of one thing. Some of the stuff's very fragile We're going to have to handle it like a baby.
Hey, I didn't spit at you.
Three inches thick. Got it in Italy. But the BIG problem is going to be the convertible sofa. You see when you move it it tends to open up so it's going to be real difficult getting it down the stairs.
Yeah there's a box spring but it's attached to the headboard and we'll have to take that apart. Then we got the couch.
Maybe they should get together. [mind] Go ahead. Kiss her. I'm a baseball player dammit.
Better bring your gloves, it's freezing out there. It shouldn't take too long. I'd say maybe, oh, four hours. Really though, Jerry, there's not that much. First we got the bedroom, we got two dressers and the bed.
You sure you don't mind?
Leave ...
Who's this chucker?
Can I help you?
