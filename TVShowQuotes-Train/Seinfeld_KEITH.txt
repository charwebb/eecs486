I don't have to but I will.
Yeah, it was. [mind] Gosh, should I kiss her good night?
Well then what are you doing with that racquet?
Would you mind if I gave her a call?
UH, do you want to catch a movie this weekend? Have you seen JFK?
Can I help you?
No should I [continuity error in fact he SHOULD from the basketball game]
Leave ...
Really, you know my mom's one quarter Cajun.
I love that bit about Jimmy Olson
Yeah. What's her story?
Goodnight. Oh, Jer, by the way, the woman we gave a ride to earlier tonight,
Well lookit, the way I remember it (back to the grainy 8mm film parody) I was walking up the ramp. I was upset about the game. That's when you called me pretty boy. It ticked me off. I started to turn around to say something and as I turned around I saw Roger McDowell behind the bushes over by that gravely road.  Anyway he was talking to someone and they were talking to you. I tried to scream out but it was too late. It was already on its way.
Well, goodnight
Well, how about this Friday?
Yeah, it really was.
Yeah.
Three inches thick. Got it in Italy. But the BIG problem is going to be the convertible sofa. You see when you move it it tends to open up so it's going to be real difficult getting it down the stairs.
Who's this chucker?
Maybe they should get together. [mind] Go ahead. Kiss her. I'm a baseball player dammit.
Well, I'm sorry you can't take that, no no no..
Hey, I didn't spit at you.

Better bring your gloves, it's freezing out there. It shouldn't take too long. I'd say maybe, oh, four hours. Really though, Jerry, there's not that much. First we got the bedroom, we got two dressers and the bed.
Ok guys, we gotta be careful of one thing. Some of the stuff's very fragile We're going to have to handle it like a baby.
You sure you don't mind?
Yeah. Twelve pieces. <not clear> coffee table.
look guys, don't worry about it, I uh, Well I guess I better get going.
Look sweetheart I don't know who you are. I don't know what you're doing here. But...
Hello.

I've always wanted to do what you do.
YOU said, "Nice game, pretty boy."
or maybe just to get together for a cup of coffee
Well, there was two outs, bottom of the tenth, we're one out away from losing the series.
