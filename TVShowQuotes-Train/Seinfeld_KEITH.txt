No should I [continuity error in fact he SHOULD from the basketball game]
Well then what are you doing with that racquet?
Look sweetheart I don't know who you are. I don't know what you're doing here. But...
Yeah, it was. [mind] Gosh, should I kiss her good night?
Better bring your gloves, it's freezing out there. It shouldn't take too long. I'd say maybe, oh, four hours. Really though, Jerry, there's not that much. First we got the bedroom, we got two dressers and the bed.
Would you mind if I gave her a call?
Yeah there's a box spring but it's attached to the headboard and we'll have to take that apart. Then we got the couch.
Maybe they should get together. [mind] Go ahead. Kiss her. I'm a baseball player dammit.
look guys, don't worry about it, I uh, Well I guess I better get going.
I've always wanted to do what you do.
Well, there was two outs, bottom of the tenth, we're one out away from losing the series.
(to Jerry) Do you perform anywhere in new York right now?
Really, you know my mom's one quarter Cajun.
You know, I live on the East Side.
UH, do you want to catch a movie this weekend? Have you seen JFK?
[mind] Come on I won the MVP in 79. I can do whatever I want to.
Well, I'm sorry you can't take that, no no no..
Excuse me. I don't want to disturb you, I'm Keith Hernandez and I just want to tell you what a big fan I am. I love your comedy.
Goodnight. Oh, Jer, by the way, the woman we gave a ride to earlier tonight,
Ok guys, we gotta be careful of one thing. Some of the stuff's very fragile We're going to have to handle it like a baby.
or maybe just to get together for a cup of coffee
