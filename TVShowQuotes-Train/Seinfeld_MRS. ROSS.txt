I'm sure there are things you'd like to say.
(Laughing out loud) Burned! (George laughs with her)
Hello, George.
Sara, what do you have on your wheels?
Something's missing all right.
Uh, who?
It's Cornish gamehen.
This is - this is...horrible.
Oh.
(Laughing, she points to her shirt) Look, Henry, I spilled wine on me! (Laughs again)
(To Mr. Ross) Doesn't George look like your sister, Sarah?
(Hysterical) Who's John?! Who's John?!
(To George) Her son's a podiatrist, you know.
Oh, you're George's friend.
Oh, mother.
Tell us more.
Really?
If I had a dime for every book he's actually read, (laughing) I'd be broke.
So will you be sure to thank Jerry for us?
We know the last three months have been hard on you.
Where is it?
Is it possible they took it back?
(Concluding) Well, they're filthy. It's just a matter of common courtesy.. (Wheels Sara over to a spot off the rug) When you come in the house you wipe your wheels.
We've got water. I don't think we have any bread, but we've got water.
I want to know who John is!
Thanks for nothing! Come on, George. Let's go upstairs.
He killed our daughter! He knew those envelopes were toxic!
Ricky, did you wipe her wheels off?
Something about a way, a-and a light, uh... ha. Who the hell knows?
My favorite.
You know, George we haven't done anything romantic like this in ....years.
(sniffing) What is that?
Right over there.
Oh, God.
George... we'll leave you alone with her.
Oh, look, an antique stand. Pull over. We'll buy you a housewarming gift.
Sounds grand.
Oh, dear. I forgot to put out that - that bread they brought.
Uh, George, the Susan Ross Foundation is having an event this weekend.
(Laughing, she's obviously getting a kick out of her husband's misfortune) Nothing! Ha, ha, ha.
You and your cigars..
We don't like you, George.
