Something about a way, a-and a light, uh... ha. Who the hell knows?
He killed our daughter! He knew those envelopes were toxic!
Tell us more.
(To Mr. Ross) Doesn't George look like your sister, Sarah?
Is it possible they took it back?
We don't like you, George.
Sara, what do you have on your wheels?
I want to know who John is!
My favorite.
(sniffing) What is that?
(Drunk, she laughs out loud) I'll take a hotel any day.
Uh, George, the Susan Ross Foundation is having an event this weekend.
Ricky, did you wipe her wheels off?
If I had a dime for every book he's actually read, (laughing) I'd be broke.
Oh.
Something's missing all right.
We've got water. I don't think we have any bread, but we've got water.
Oh, God.
(Concluding) Well, they're filthy. It's just a matter of common courtesy.. (Wheels Sara over to a spot off the rug) When you come in the house you wipe your wheels.
(Laughing, she points to her shirt) Look, Henry, I spilled wine on me! (Laughs again)
(To George) Her son's a podiatrist, you know.
Really?
(Laughing out loud) Burned! (George laughs with her)
Where is it?
We know the last three months have been hard on you.
Uh, who?
Thanks for nothing! Come on, George. Let's go upstairs.
It's Cornish gamehen.
(Laughing, she's obviously getting a kick out of her husband's misfortune) Nothing! Ha, ha, ha.
I can't take this. Let me out of this thing!
I'm sure there are things you'd like to say.
Oh, dear. I forgot to put out that - that bread they brought.
You and your cigars..
Oh, mother.
Right over there.
This is - this is...horrible.
Don't worry, George. The foundation will revolve around your schedule. Evenings, weekends, whenever you have free time.
Oh, you're George's friend.
Thank you for calling, George.
So will you be sure to thank Jerry for us?
Sounds grand.
Hello, George.
