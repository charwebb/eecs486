We know the last three months have been hard on you.
So will you be sure to thank Jerry for us?
(Laughing out loud) Burned! (George laughs with her)
If I had a dime for every book he's actually read, (laughing) I'd be broke.
Oh, dear. I forgot to put out that - that bread they brought.
He killed our daughter! He knew those envelopes were toxic!
Sara, what do you have on your wheels?
(Concluding) Well, they're filthy. It's just a matter of common courtesy.. (Wheels Sara over to a spot off the rug) When you come in the house you wipe your wheels.
I can't take this. Let me out of this thing!
(To Mr. Ross) Doesn't George look like your sister, Sarah?
(Drunk, she laughs out loud) I'll take a hotel any day.
Thanks for nothing! Come on, George. Let's go upstairs.
I'm sure there are things you'd like to say.
(Laughing, she's obviously getting a kick out of her husband's misfortune) Nothing! Ha, ha, ha.
Don't worry, George. The foundation will revolve around your schedule. Evenings, weekends, whenever you have free time.
(Laughing, she points to her shirt) Look, Henry, I spilled wine on me! (Laughs again)
We've got water. I don't think we have any bread, but we've got water.
Uh, George, the Susan Ross Foundation is having an event this weekend.
(To George) Her son's a podiatrist, you know.
Something about a way, a-and a light, uh... ha. Who the hell knows?
