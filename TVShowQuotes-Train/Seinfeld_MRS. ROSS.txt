Don't worry, George. The foundation will revolve around your schedule. Evenings, weekends, whenever you have free time.
Where is it?
(sniffing) What is that?
(To Mr. Ross) Doesn't George look like your sister, Sarah?
Something about a way, a-and a light, uh... ha. Who the hell knows?
So will you be sure to thank Jerry for us?
Oh, you're George's friend.
(Laughing out loud) Burned! (George laughs with her)
I want to know who John is!
(Laughing, she's obviously getting a kick out of her husband's misfortune) Nothing! Ha, ha, ha.
Hello, George.
Uh, who?
He killed our daughter! He knew those envelopes were toxic!
If I had a dime for every book he's actually read, (laughing) I'd be broke.
(Drunk, she laughs out loud) I'll take a hotel any day.
Right over there.
You know, George we haven't done anything romantic like this in ....years.
Oh, God.
(Hysterical) Who's John?! Who's John?!
Thank you for calling, George.
(Laughing, she points to her shirt) Look, Henry, I spilled wine on me! (Laughs again)
Thanks for nothing! Come on, George. Let's go upstairs.
Oh, mother.
Really?
George... we'll leave you alone with her.
I'm sure there are things you'd like to say.
We've got water. I don't think we have any bread, but we've got water.
Tell us more.
(Concluding) Well, they're filthy. It's just a matter of common courtesy.. (Wheels Sara over to a spot off the rug) When you come in the house you wipe your wheels.
Sara, what do you have on your wheels?
Oh, dear. I forgot to put out that - that bread they brought.
Oh.
It's Cornish gamehen.
Something's missing all right.
I can't take this. Let me out of this thing!
Oh, look, an antique stand. Pull over. We'll buy you a housewarming gift.
We don't like you, George.
Sounds grand.
We know the last three months have been hard on you.
Ricky, did you wipe her wheels off?
Is it possible they took it back?
My favorite.
