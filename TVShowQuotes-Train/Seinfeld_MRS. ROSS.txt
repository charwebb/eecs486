He killed our daughter! He knew those envelopes were toxic!
(To George) Her son's a podiatrist, you know.
Something about a way, a-and a light, uh... ha. Who the hell knows?
Sara, what do you have on your wheels?
We know the last three months have been hard on you.
You know, George we haven't done anything romantic like this in ....years.
(Concluding) Well, they're filthy. It's just a matter of common courtesy.. (Wheels Sara over to a spot off the rug) When you come in the house you wipe your wheels.
(To Mr. Ross) Doesn't George look like your sister, Sarah?
Thanks for nothing! Come on, George. Let's go upstairs.
(Laughing, she points to her shirt) Look, Henry, I spilled wine on me! (Laughs again)
Oh, dear. I forgot to put out that - that bread they brought.
Oh, look, an antique stand. Pull over. We'll buy you a housewarming gift.
So will you be sure to thank Jerry for us?
Uh, George, the Susan Ross Foundation is having an event this weekend.
(Laughing out loud) Burned! (George laughs with her)
(Drunk, she laughs out loud) I'll take a hotel any day.
Don't worry, George. The foundation will revolve around your schedule. Evenings, weekends, whenever you have free time.
(Laughing, she's obviously getting a kick out of her husband's misfortune) Nothing! Ha, ha, ha.
I'm sure there are things you'd like to say.
If I had a dime for every book he's actually read, (laughing) I'd be broke.
