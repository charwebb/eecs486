We've got water. I don't think we have any bread, but we've got water.
He killed our daughter! He knew those envelopes were toxic!
(sniffing) What is that?
Really?
Oh, dear. I forgot to put out that - that bread they brought.
Uh, who?
It's Cornish gamehen.
Something about a way, a-and a light, uh... ha. Who the hell knows?
Thank you for calling, George.
Oh, God.
Tell us more.
Something's missing all right.
Thanks for nothing! Come on, George. Let's go upstairs.
You and your cigars..
Uh, George, the Susan Ross Foundation is having an event this weekend.
So will you be sure to thank Jerry for us?
You know, George we haven't done anything romantic like this in ....years.
Where is it?
This is - this is...horrible.
(Laughing, she's obviously getting a kick out of her husband's misfortune) Nothing! Ha, ha, ha.
Sounds grand.
If I had a dime for every book he's actually read, (laughing) I'd be broke.
Don't worry, George. The foundation will revolve around your schedule. Evenings, weekends, whenever you have free time.
Oh.
We don't like you, George.
Oh, you're George's friend.
Oh, look, an antique stand. Pull over. We'll buy you a housewarming gift.
(To George) Her son's a podiatrist, you know.
(Laughing, she points to her shirt) Look, Henry, I spilled wine on me! (Laughs again)
Oh, mother.
Right over there.
Is it possible they took it back?
I want to know who John is!
I can't take this. Let me out of this thing!
(To Mr. Ross) Doesn't George look like your sister, Sarah?
My favorite.
We know the last three months have been hard on you.
George... we'll leave you alone with her.
Ricky, did you wipe her wheels off?
(Laughing out loud) Burned! (George laughs with her)
(Hysterical) Who's John?! Who's John?!
I'm sure there are things you'd like to say.
