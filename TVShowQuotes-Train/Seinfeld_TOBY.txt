BOO! BOO! Hiss! Boo! (Toby's obnoxious behavior causes Jerry to completely lose his place and mess up his act.)
Well, that's the way I express myself. How are you gonna make it in this business if you can't take it?
Yes! Yes! Right on! Right on! (Other audience members give her puzzled looks.)
He is going to Knopp. He is going to be a vice president.
Well, how would you like it if I called security?
No. I hear he wants to promote someone in-house.
What about you? (laughs) I'm only kidding. You're funny, too. I love to laugh.
Oh well, I could use some coffee.
Well, it's a possibility, like you said! Stranger things have happened! Thank you, Elaine. Thank you. (Exits.)
Hi!
Oh, come on! I thought you're a pro! That's part of the show.
Oh, that is so true, yes!
Oh, I'm great! Just great. Really great! Oh, hey - did you hear about Bob Rosen?
Me? Nothing's wrong with me.
These are great! Just great! Really great! Really, really great! Don't you think so, Elaine?
You really deserve it. I mean, you have experience, seniority...Lippman really respects your opinion...
Oh! He swears like he thinks I don't believe him. I believe you. I believe you! Oh, he's so funny! (laughs)

Oh, a coffee table book about coffee tables! (To Kramer) How did you come up with this idea?
Oh, really! Really! That is so true!
You are so funny!
Boy, wouldn't that be exciting!
Maybe it'll be you!
No...
Wow! Me! A senior editor! (deadly serious) I'd like that.
Oh yeah, we don't want some jerk sitting in front of us, it'll be like, 'Hey, big head, can you move out of the way? I didn't pay a cover charge to stare at your bald spot.' (laughs)
Oh, have a great show. Hey, we'll make sure it's a great show!
Oh no, no thank you.
Let's go. (Ronnie walks by Jerry.)
Ohhh, that is a great idea! Really, really great!
You know, I have work to do here! I'm very busy!
Oh, look at this one! It's saying, 'I'm a coffee table, put some coffee on me! Oh, the hotter the better, that's what I'm here for!' (laughs)
Really? You think so?
