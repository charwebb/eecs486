Yes! Yes! Right on! Right on! (Other audience members give her puzzled looks.)
BOO! BOO! Hiss! Boo! (Toby's obnoxious behavior causes Jerry to completely lose his place and mess up his act.)
Ohhh, that is a great idea! Really, really great!
Well, that's the way I express myself. How are you gonna make it in this business if you can't take it?
Well, how would you like it if I called security?
Wow! Me! A senior editor! (deadly serious) I'd like that.
Oh yeah, we don't want some jerk sitting in front of us, it'll be like, 'Hey, big head, can you move out of the way? I didn't pay a cover charge to stare at your bald spot.' (laughs)
What about you? (laughs) I'm only kidding. You're funny, too. I love to laugh.
Oh, look at this one! It's saying, 'I'm a coffee table, put some coffee on me! Oh, the hotter the better, that's what I'm here for!' (laughs)
These are great! Just great! Really great! Really, really great! Don't you think so, Elaine?
Oh, he's so great! This is so great! I'm so excited!
Oh! He swears like he thinks I don't believe him. I believe you. I believe you! Oh, he's so funny! (laughs)
Oh, a coffee table book about coffee tables! (To Kramer) How did you come up with this idea?
Well, it's a possibility, like you said! Stranger things have happened! Thank you, Elaine. Thank you. (Exits.)
You really deserve it. I mean, you have experience, seniority...Lippman really respects your opinion...
Oh, come on! I thought you're a pro! That's part of the show.
No. I hear he wants to promote someone in-house.
No, (gets up out of her chair) that's it. (Kramer arrives; to Kramer) Get out of the way.
Oh, I'm great! Just great. Really great! Oh, hey - did you hear about Bob Rosen?
This is so exciting! Look, I have goosebumps! (To Jerry) Touch! Touch them! (Jerry touches her arm. Toby screeches with excitement.) I've never been to a comedy club before!
Oh, have a great show. Hey, we'll make sure it's a great show!
