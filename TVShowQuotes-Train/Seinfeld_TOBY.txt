You know, I have work to do here! I'm very busy!
Well, it's a possibility, like you said! Stranger things have happened! Thank you, Elaine. Thank you. (Exits.)
Oh, I'm great! Just great. Really great! Oh, hey - did you hear about Bob Rosen?
Wow! Me! A senior editor! (deadly serious) I'd like that.
BOO! BOO! Hiss! Boo! (Toby's obnoxious behavior causes Jerry to completely lose his place and mess up his act.)
Oh, a coffee table book about coffee tables! (To Kramer) How did you come up with this idea?
What about you? (laughs) I'm only kidding. You're funny, too. I love to laugh.
Ohhh, that is a great idea! Really, really great!
Well, how would you like it if I called security?
Oh! He swears like he thinks I don't believe him. I believe you. I believe you! Oh, he's so funny! (laughs)
No, (gets up out of her chair) that's it. (Kramer arrives; to Kramer) Get out of the way.
Oh, come on! I thought you're a pro! That's part of the show.
Oh, have a great show. Hey, we'll make sure it's a great show!
You really deserve it. I mean, you have experience, seniority...Lippman really respects your opinion...
Yes! Yes! Right on! Right on! (Other audience members give her puzzled looks.)
This is so exciting! Look, I have goosebumps! (To Jerry) Touch! Touch them! (Jerry touches her arm. Toby screeches with excitement.) I've never been to a comedy club before!
Oh yeah, we don't want some jerk sitting in front of us, it'll be like, 'Hey, big head, can you move out of the way? I didn't pay a cover charge to stare at your bald spot.' (laughs)
Oh, look at this one! It's saying, 'I'm a coffee table, put some coffee on me! Oh, the hotter the better, that's what I'm here for!' (laughs)
No. I hear he wants to promote someone in-house.
Oh, he's so great! This is so great! I'm so excited!
Well, that's the way I express myself. How are you gonna make it in this business if you can't take it?
