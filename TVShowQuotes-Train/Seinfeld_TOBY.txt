Well, that's the way I express myself. How are you gonna make it in this business if you can't take it?
Really? You think so?
You know, I have work to do here! I'm very busy!
Me? Nothing's wrong with me.
Oh no, no thank you.
Oh, look at this one! It's saying, 'I'm a coffee table, put some coffee on me! Oh, the hotter the better, that's what I'm here for!' (laughs)
No, (gets up out of her chair) that's it. (Kramer arrives; to Kramer) Get out of the way.
Oh, that is so true, yes!
Oh, come on! I thought you're a pro! That's part of the show.
Oh! He swears like he thinks I don't believe him. I believe you. I believe you! Oh, he's so funny! (laughs)
Hi!
He is going to Knopp. He is going to be a vice president.
Oh yeah, we don't want some jerk sitting in front of us, it'll be like, 'Hey, big head, can you move out of the way? I didn't pay a cover charge to stare at your bald spot.' (laughs)
No...
Maybe it'll be you!
Oh well, I could use some coffee.
Let's go. (Ronnie walks by Jerry.)
Oh, a coffee table book about coffee tables! (To Kramer) How did you come up with this idea?
This is so exciting! Look, I have goosebumps! (To Jerry) Touch! Touch them! (Jerry touches her arm. Toby screeches with excitement.) I've never been to a comedy club before!
Oh, have a great show. Hey, we'll make sure it's a great show!
Ohhh, that is a great idea! Really, really great!
Oh, he's so great! This is so great! I'm so excited!
How are you doing today?
You are so funny!
What about you? (laughs) I'm only kidding. You're funny, too. I love to laugh.
These are great! Just great! Really great! Really, really great! Don't you think so, Elaine?
(voice; screaming) My pinky toe!
BOO! BOO! Hiss! Boo! (Toby's obnoxious behavior causes Jerry to completely lose his place and mess up his act.)
Boy, wouldn't that be exciting!
Oh, I'm great! Just great. Really great! Oh, hey - did you hear about Bob Rosen?
Oh, really! Really! That is so true!
Yes! Yes! Right on! Right on! (Other audience members give her puzzled looks.)
Well, how would you like it if I called security?
Wow! Me! A senior editor! (deadly serious) I'd like that.
