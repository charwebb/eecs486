Shut up, turd! We're watching Friends!

O Skyler, I love you. 

What the hell is wrong with you?! How come you're not yelling and whining?!

Hey!

You little jerk!  You were trying to kill grampa! I'm telling mom!

I said shut up, or I will destroy you, tur-r-rd!

Let me hit him, Mom!

No, I mean, what the hell are you doing to grampa?! 

Oh, you are such stupid turds.

What if my sweetheart is online looking for me? He could be wondering why I don't get online with him. Maybe he thinks I'm dead.  If my darling Amir gets another Internet girlfriend, I'm gonna kill him! And you! 

What do you want, Larry? 

Well, I'm watching Friends, turd!  That's my boyfriend. Go answer the door while I make sure I don't have food in my braces. 

You don't think so?

Uhwwell, okay.  I'll try. But I'm not promising anything. 
1, 2, 3, 4
So much pain in the world today.
Too many turds are headin' my way.
But we can press our turds together.
Passing by turds whenever.

He's 22! 

Ew! You're gonna get it now.

Are you looking at my headgear?

Are you looking at my headgear?

What's going on, Dad? 

You're nine twenty three now.

Come on! We've got to get the house clean before your mom gets home.  You know, Eric. It's kind of cool that two people who hated each other can be friends.

You mean this one? 

Wow, she passed out.

I wanna watch TV.

Give me the remote!

I just think your sound is kind of... last week.

BEER IS ALL WHEAT, DAD!!

Oh my God, it's John Travolta! 

Serves you right, you little brat!

Turn it off, Dad!

But don't bug me and Skyler! Come on!

Jesus! What the hell are you doing?

Don't limit me! You don't even understand me!

Dad, what are you doing here?

He's my boyfriend! 

It's not Stan's fault.

Dad! 

No, turds!

We left you some crusts! 

Turd wedgie. Come in the kitchen, Skyler. There's refreshments 

What's going on, Dad? 

You can't run from your past, turds. Apologize and make amends. Then I'll protect you from this Trent turd. 

Honestly? I think you guys need some work.

I swear I'm gonna kill you Stan!

I can't find it. Somebody took it.

Shut up, brat!

Give me that picture!

Six.  We still, have, SIX. 

We need to run over to the hospital and identify her body! We'll be right back.

Maybe if Larry had a nice steak once in a while he wouldn't get beat up by every kid in school. 

I told you I needed tampons, tuurrddsss!

Well, I do have a song I wrote.

O... kay.

Maybe you should let your son decide that for himself. 

What the hell do you want?

What?! No you don't!

Bears?

Open this door, Turdledove!

Leave me alone, Dad! Stop nagging me all the time!

Mom, I can't see.

Skyler, your band can't practice here.

Ohh boy, you are gonna get it now. 

Wow!

You're a turd! You're the Turdman of Alcatraz!

Calm down, turd! No Juvenile Hall turd is going to kill you. That's my job.

This won't take me long!

Shut up, turd! You're going to admit to Ms. Claridge what you did!

I'm almost done.

Your mom's gonna get home soon. We're gonna get busted!

Yes, but I'm gonna want something in return.

Okay, yay, thanks, love you guys. 

We're going outside to watch a meteor shower! I'm locking you in your room 'til we get back in, turd!

We're watching this!

All right. I just started my period, and I need tampons. If one of you turds go buy them at the store for me, you can watch your stupid turd show with your stupid turd movie commercial in it!

My boyfriend is coming over, so you go to the kitchen, and you make us that pizza before I snap you in half like the little turd-stick you are!

Are you staring at my neckbrace?

Shut up, turd! I'm watching television!

Okay. 

This is taking too long! When do I get to use the Internet?!

Nothing, Dad. Go back to killing the family. 

It wasn't Stan, he was…it was with me the whole time.

I hate this family, I hate it! 

We're not watching this! 

You're right! He is a scumbag! I wish I could get him back! I just don't know how.

And I got a victory point for the most roads connecting settlements.

Move! 

You'll never be bigger than me Stan.  Never!

Yes.

Alright, turd, listen up! Now that your mom is gone, I'm in charge. I don't know how you treat your other babysitters, but when I'm babysitting, you're nothing but a little turd. You're a stinky dried-up stupid turd! Got it?!

What?

Really? You would do that?

Hey!  Do you wanna play Settlers of Catan on Xbox? 

The Russell Crowe Show? You turds don't even like that show!

Go! Go! 

Stop crying, turd! Now, who's gonna kill you?

Why do you hate me?!

Ooo, Stan's in trouble. Let me kick his ass, Mom.

Gggggyyaaah! 

There is one thing I love more than Russell Crowe, and that is seeing you unhappy. So, Buffy it is!

Finally.

I have to get online with my darling Amir before school starts!

Go away, turd!

If I die from this, I'm taking you with me!

Figure it out, turd!

Really?

She will too! She has to show up, and if I don't get to see her I'm gonna kill myself!

HAha! I knew you sent the cat, and that's why I went outside and got him!

...So I said, "you're a little turd!" and he w-

Shut up, turd!

Skyler, not here.

Shut up, fat turd!!

Just keep the volume down! I have to go deal with Turdboy. 

Mom, Dad, Kelly and Stacy are going to the Women of Rock concert! Can I go with them?! 

Well, maybe just one kiss.

Oh, whoo-peee!

I don't care.  He acted like he really liked me. Nobody's ever liked me before.  I can't believe I trusted him. I'm so stupid.

No.

Can't you all see I'm in pain?! Nobody understands pure love! Amir and I are closer than anybody in this stupid family! 

I placed his underwear over his head.

Gross, Dad, sick! 

My brother is a stupid turd.

What is that? What is that? 

Give me that picture, turd!

Mom, what's up Dad's ass?

Thanks for all your help, Eric. You know, as far as turds go, you're okay. 

Yeah. 

Not really. She's dead.

What number are you, turd?

Praise Christ.

What?? But I thought you liked me.

Oh. Hold on a second, Carrie. 

What the-?

Stop it!

Eight days tomorrow.

I don't wanna go in there.

Go on, Astroturd!

Who is that?!

Amiiir... I miss you so much...

Not the vegans!

Well, let's clean up the house. Looks like everything turned out o-kay.

I charge $5 for the first hour, 5% bumps every hour after that up to six hours, which enters into golden time.

They're having a cat orgy!

Do something, you stupid vegan!

Shut up, turd. I'm watching Buffy.

I'm gonna bust this door down! 

...Oh, all right, get your turd coat. You can come see the meteor shower with us.

Life so full of happiness?
Feel free to mark my words.
But me and you, will my love do
in a world that's full of turds? TURDS!
llama judgin finger-lovin' turds. TURDS!

Oh, you stupid turd!

In a world that's full of turds. TURDS!

Haha! That was a turd trick. Your mom isn't really dead!

That showsh for babiesh, it'sh show shtupid.

I said shut up, turd!

What are you doing?

Nobody my age would go out with me 'cause I'm too ugly.

God I hate this family!

So can I go or not?!

Yeah, okay. Sounds good.

Hey, Skyler.

I saw three ships come sailing in
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day
I saw three ships come sailing in 
On Christmas Day, in the morning. 
And what was in those ships, all three? 
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day
And what- 
Shut up, turds! 
-was in those ships all three
On Christmas Day, in the morning?
The Virgin Mary and Christ were there 
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day 
The Virgin Mary and-
Shut up, TUUUURDS! 
-Christ were there
On Christmas Day, in the morning.
Let us all rejoice, amain, 
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day 
And let- 
I told you to shut up! 
-us all rejoice, amain,
On Christmas Day, in the morning. 
Shelly is starting to get pissed 
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day 
Shelly got up and killed the turds 
On Christmas Day, in the MORNING! 

Okay.

...But when you've seen one turd, you've seen them all.  ...stupid turd! The one night-

Thank you, Aunt Flo.

Whats going on dad?

Huh?

No, Skyler, I'm not putting out for you!

Dad, the Internet's not working!

Ooooo, Stan's in trouble!

No!

Geez, what's up Dad's ass?

But Mom, Lorde is playing! You can't not let me go or I'll hate you forever! 

'Cause I'm twelve! 

Hey Eric! Your mom's been in an accident!

Nnno, Skyler, I'm embarrassed!

Hey Mom, do you like Australia? 'Cause that was the Great Barrier Queef. 

You're such an amazing poet, Skyler.

Wha-?

NO!
