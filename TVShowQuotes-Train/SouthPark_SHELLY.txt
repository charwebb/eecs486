But Mom, Lorde is playing! You can't not let me go or I'll hate you forever! 
Your mom's gonna get home soon. We're gonna get busted!
I don't care.  He acted like he really liked me. Nobody's ever liked me before.  I can't believe I trusted him. I'm so stupid.
No, I mean, what the hell are you doing to grampa?! 
Turd wedgie. Come in the kitchen, Skyler. There's refreshments 
Uhwwell, okay.  I'll try. But I'm not promising anything. 
1, 2, 3, 4
So much pain in the world today.
Too many turds are headin' my way.
But we can press our turds together.
Passing by turds whenever.
Maybe you should let your son decide that for himself. 
In a world that's full of turds. TURDS!
This is taking too long! When do I get to use the Internet?!
If I die from this, I'm taking you with me!
Shut up, turd! You're going to admit to Ms. Claridge what you did!
I saw three ships come sailing in
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day
I saw three ships come sailing in 
On Christmas Day, in the morning. 
And what was in those ships, all three? 
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day
And what- 
Shut up, turds! 
-was in those ships all three
On Christmas Day, in the morning?
The Virgin Mary and Christ were there 
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day 
The Virgin Mary and-
Shut up, TUUUURDS! 
-Christ were there
On Christmas Day, in the morning.
Let us all rejoice, amain, 
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day 
And let- 
I told you to shut up! 
-us all rejoice, amain,
On Christmas Day, in the morning. 
Shelly is starting to get pissed 
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day 
Shelly got up and killed the turds 
On Christmas Day, in the MORNING! 
Your mom doesn't get home for three more hours! That's plenty of time for me to make a turd sandwich out of you. 
Nothing, Dad. Go back to killing the family. 
No, Skyler, I'm not putting out for you!
Honestly? I think you guys need some work.
The Russell Crowe Show? You turds don't even like that show!
Alright, turd, listen up! Now that your mom is gone, I'm in charge. I don't know how you treat your other babysitters, but when I'm babysitting, you're nothing but a little turd. You're a stinky dried-up stupid turd! Got it?!
Hey Eric! Your mom's been in an accident!
Ooo, Stan's in trouble. Let me kick his ass, Mom.
Life so full of happiness?
Feel free to mark my words.
But me and you, will my love do
in a world that's full of turds? TURDS!
llama judgin finger-lovin' turds. TURDS!
Can't you all see I'm in pain?! Nobody understands pure love! Amir and I are closer than anybody in this stupid family! 
...So I said, "you're a little turd!" and he w-
Well, I'm watching Friends, turd!  That's my boyfriend. Go answer the door while I make sure I don't have food in my braces. 
Nobody my age would go out with me 'cause I'm too ugly.
It wasn't Stan, he was…it was with me the whole time.
Well, let's clean up the house. Looks like everything turned out o-kay.
That's stupid! See your turdy trailer some other time!
Yes, but I'm gonna want something in return.
Don't limit me! You don't even understand me!
It's working! I can i-chat with my darling Amir now! 
You little jerk!  You were trying to kill grampa! I'm telling mom!
She will too! She has to show up, and if I don't get to see her I'm gonna kill myself!
Stop crying, turd! Now, who's gonna kill you?
I have to get online with my darling Amir before school starts!
I charge $5 for the first hour, 5% bumps every hour after that up to six hours, which enters into golden time.
Mom, Dad, Kelly and Stacy are going to the Women of Rock concert! Can I go with them?! 
What the hell is wrong with you?! How come you're not yelling and whining?!
We need to run over to the hospital and identify her body! We'll be right back.
...But when you've seen one turd, you've seen them all.  ...stupid turd! The one night-
Well, I do have a song I wrote.
You'll never be bigger than me Stan.  Never!
Mom, I'm i-chatting with my boyfriend in Montana!
Ohh boy, you are gonna get it now. 
But don't bug me and Skyler! Come on!
We're going outside to watch a meteor shower! I'm locking you in your room 'til we get back in, turd!
Hey!  Do you wanna play Settlers of Catan on Xbox? 
And I got a victory point for the most roads connecting settlements.
You can't run from your past, turds. Apologize and make amends. Then I'll protect you from this Trent turd. 
Just keep the volume down! I have to go deal with Turdboy. 
HAha! I knew you sent the cat, and that's why I went outside and got him!
My boyfriend is coming over, so you go to the kitchen, and you make us that pizza before I snap you in half like the little turd-stick you are!
I don't know, Skyler. It's just kind of strange to me that you're 22 and all.
Come on! We've got to get the house clean before your mom gets home.  You know, Eric. It's kind of cool that two people who hated each other can be friends.
I just think your sound is kind of... last week.
You're a turd! You're the Turdman of Alcatraz!
Thanks for all your help, Eric. You know, as far as turds go, you're okay. 
And they'd better be here when I come back downstairs, turds! 
There is one thing I love more than Russell Crowe, and that is seeing you unhappy. So, Buffy it is!
No! It's Eric's fault. He let those cats in here.
Calm down, turd! No Juvenile Hall turd is going to kill you. That's my job.
Leave me alone, Dad! Stop nagging me all the time!
Hey Mom, do you like Australia? 'Cause that was the Great Barrier Queef.
