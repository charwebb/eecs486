Six.  We still, have, SIX. 

O... kay.

That's stupid! See your turdy trailer some other time!

Oh. Hold on a second, Carrie. 

Well, let's clean up the house. Looks like everything turned out o-kay.

NO!

Huh?

Give me that picture, turd!

I hate this family, I hate it! 

Nobody my age would go out with me 'cause I'm too ugly.

I just think your sound is kind of... last week.

Stop crying, turd! Now, who's gonna kill you?

Okay, yay, thanks, love you guys. 

This is taking too long! When do I get to use the Internet?!

Finally.

Nothing, Dad. Go back to killing the family. 

What's going on, Dad? 

Come on! We've got to get the house clean before your mom gets home.  You know, Eric. It's kind of cool that two people who hated each other can be friends.

Shut up, turd. I'm watching Buffy.

Me neither.

Amiiir... I miss you so much...

Yeah, okay. Sounds good.

This won't take me long!

Life so full of happiness?
Feel free to mark my words.
But me and you, will my love do
in a world that's full of turds? TURDS!
llama judgin finger-lovin' turds. TURDS!

You can't run from your past, turds. Apologize and make amends. Then I'll protect you from this Trent turd. 

Give me the remote!

Uhwwell, okay.  I'll try. But I'm not promising anything. 
1, 2, 3, 4
So much pain in the world today.
Too many turds are headin' my way.
But we can press our turds together.
Passing by turds whenever.

My brother is a stupid turd.

Skyler, your band can't practice here.

Oh my God, it's John Travolta! 

My boyfriend is coming over, so you go to the kitchen, and you make us that pizza before I snap you in half like the little turd-stick you are!

Dad, the Internet's not working!

...So I said, "you're a little turd!" and he w-

All right. I just started my period, and I need tampons. If one of you turds go buy them at the store for me, you can watch your stupid turd show with your stupid turd movie commercial in it!

Oh, you are such stupid turds.

Don't limit me! You don't even understand me!

Well, I do have a song I wrote.

What?? But I thought you liked me.

Yes, but I'm gonna want something in return.

Not the vegans!

It's not Stan's fault.

Your mom doesn't get home for three more hours! That's plenty of time for me to make a turd sandwich out of you. 

Eight days tomorrow.

I have to get online with my darling Amir before school starts!

Really? You would do that?

Shut up, turd! We're watching Friends!

No, turds!

What do you want, Larry? 

Hey!  Do you wanna play Settlers of Catan on Xbox? 

Yes.

Oh my Gohhhd!

No, I mean, what the hell are you doing to grampa?! 

Can't you all see I'm in pain?! Nobody understands pure love! Amir and I are closer than anybody in this stupid family! 

Serves you right, you little brat!

He's my boyfriend! 

You mean this one? 

Wha-?

But don't bug me and Skyler! Come on!

I charge $5 for the first hour, 5% bumps every hour after that up to six hours, which enters into golden time.

Okay. 

You're nine twenty three now.

Okay.

You little liar. 

What the hell is wrong with you?! How come you're not yelling and whining?!

What are you doing?

Bears?

HAha! I knew you sent the cat, and that's why I went outside and got him!

We're going outside to watch a meteor shower! I'm locking you in your room 'til we get back in, turd!

Praise Christ.

I said shut up, or I will destroy you, tur-r-rd!

Jesus! What the hell are you doing?

Ew! You're gonna get it now.

What?

What do you want, Larry? 

I'm gonna bust this door down! 

Mom, I'm i-chatting with my boyfriend in Montana!

Mom, I can't see.

Oh, you stupid turd!

Figure it out, turd!

I saw three ships come sailing in
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day
I saw three ships come sailing in 
On Christmas Day, in the morning. 
And what was in those ships, all three? 
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day
And what- 
Shut up, turds! 
-was in those ships all three
On Christmas Day, in the morning?
The Virgin Mary and Christ were there 
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day 
The Virgin Mary and-
Shut up, TUUUURDS! 
-Christ were there
On Christmas Day, in the morning.
Let us all rejoice, amain, 
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day 
And let- 
I told you to shut up! 
-us all rejoice, amain,
On Christmas Day, in the morning. 
Shelly is starting to get pissed 
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day 
Shelly got up and killed the turds 
On Christmas Day, in the MORNING! 

Really?

Shut up, brat!

Yeah. 

Thank you, Aunt Flo.

Honestly? I think you guys need some work.

Stop it!

The Russell Crowe Show? You turds don't even like that show!

Guess again, Richard the Turd!

You're such an amazing poet, Skyler.

Hey Mom, do you like Australia? 'Cause that was the Great Barrier Queef. 

We're not watching this! 

...Oh, all right, get your turd coat. You can come see the meteor shower with us.

I will.

...But when you've seen one turd, you've seen them all.  ...stupid turd! The one night-

Thanks for all your help, Eric. You know, as far as turds go, you're okay. 

No! It's Eric's fault. He let those cats in here.

What?! No you don't!

Ooo, Stan's in trouble. Let me kick his ass, Mom.

But Mom, Lorde is playing! You can't not let me go or I'll hate you forever! 

In a world that's full of turds. TURDS!

Ohh boy, you are gonna get it now. 

Hey!

Nnno, Skyler, I'm embarrassed!

Wow!

It's gonna kill us!

'Cause I'm twelve! 

Well, I'm watching Friends, turd!  That's my boyfriend. Go answer the door while I make sure I don't have food in my braces. 

Are you staring at my neckbrace?

Why do you hate me?!

Who said that? 

He's 22! 

So can I go or not?!

And I got a victory point for the most roads connecting settlements.

God I hate this family!

Whats going on dad?

What's going on, Dad? 

And they'd better be here when I come back downstairs, turds! 

Do something, you stupid vegan!

I don't know, Skyler. It's just kind of strange to me that you're 22 and all.

If I die from this, I'm taking you with me!

Go away, turd!

Turd wedgie. Come in the kitchen, Skyler. There's refreshments 

What the-?

We need to run over to the hospital and identify her body! We'll be right back.

Give me that picture!

O Skyler, I love you. 

We're watching this!

We're back togehhhther! We're back togehhhther!

Are you looking at my headgear?

Well, maybe just one kiss.

You don't think so?

It wasn't Stan, he was…it was with me the whole time.

No, Skyler, I'm not putting out for you!

Maybe you should let your son decide that for himself. 

Hey Eric! Your mom's been in an accident!

Not really. She's dead.

Calm down, turd! No Juvenile Hall turd is going to kill you. That's my job.

Let me hit him, Mom!

What number are you, turd?

What do you say, Stanley?

Shut up, turd! You're going to admit to Ms. Claridge what you did!

Oh, whoo-peee!

You little jerk!  You were trying to kill grampa! I'm telling mom!

They're having a cat orgy!

No!

Wow, she passed out.

Gross, Dad, sick! 

You'll never be bigger than me Stan.  Never!

Mom, what's up Dad's ass?

Are you looking at my headgear?

Ooooo, Stan's in trouble!

Skyler, not here.

Haha! That was a turd trick. Your mom isn't really dead!

I'm almost done.

Who is that?!

We left you some crusts! 

I told you I needed tampons, tuurrddsss!

Turn it off, Dad!

Go on, Astroturd!

BEER IS ALL WHEAT, DAD!!

It's working! I can i-chat with my darling Amir now! 

Shut up, fat turd!!

Open this door, Turdledove!

Gggggyyaaah! 

I wanna watch TV.

I said shut up, turd!

Move! 

That showsh for babiesh, it'sh show shtupid.

What if my sweetheart is online looking for me? He could be wondering why I don't get online with him. Maybe he thinks I'm dead.  If my darling Amir gets another Internet girlfriend, I'm gonna kill him! And you! 

Just keep the volume down! I have to go deal with Turdboy. 

What is that? What is that? 

I don't wanna go in there.

What the hell do you want?

Shut up, turd!

Dad! 

I don't care.  He acted like he really liked me. Nobody's ever liked me before.  I can't believe I trusted him. I'm so stupid.

Dad, what are you doing here?
