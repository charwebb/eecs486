Nothing, Dad. Go back to killing the family. 
Maybe if Larry had a nice steak once in a while he wouldn't get beat up by every kid in school. 
I charge $5 for the first hour, 5% bumps every hour after that up to six hours, which enters into golden time.
And they'd better be here when I come back downstairs, turds! 
What if my sweetheart is online looking for me? He could be wondering why I don't get online with him. Maybe he thinks I'm dead.  If my darling Amir gets another Internet girlfriend, I'm gonna kill him! And you! 
Just keep the volume down! I have to go deal with Turdboy. 
Hey!  Do you wanna play Settlers of Catan on Xbox? 
There is one thing I love more than Russell Crowe, and that is seeing you unhappy. So, Buffy it is!
Mom, I'm i-chatting with my boyfriend in Montana!
She will too! She has to show up, and if I don't get to see her I'm gonna kill myself!
Your mom doesn't get home for three more hours! That's plenty of time for me to make a turd sandwich out of you. 
Your mom's gonna get home soon. We're gonna get busted!
This is taking too long! When do I get to use the Internet?!
All right. I just started my period, and I need tampons. If one of you turds go buy them at the store for me, you can watch your stupid turd show with your stupid turd movie commercial in it!
Well, let's clean up the house. Looks like everything turned out o-kay.
The Russell Crowe Show? You turds don't even like that show!
Shut up, turd! You're going to admit to Ms. Claridge what you did!
Come on! We've got to get the house clean before your mom gets home.  You know, Eric. It's kind of cool that two people who hated each other can be friends.
...Oh, all right, get your turd coat. You can come see the meteor shower with us.
...So I said, "you're a little turd!" and he w-
I said shut up, or I will destroy you, tur-r-rd!
But Mom, Lorde is playing! You can't not let me go or I'll hate you forever! 
If I die from this, I'm taking you with me!
Leave me alone, Dad! Stop nagging me all the time!
That's stupid! See your turdy trailer some other time!
No, I mean, what the hell are you doing to grampa?! 
Thanks for all your help, Eric. You know, as far as turds go, you're okay. 
Well, I'm watching Friends, turd!  That's my boyfriend. Go answer the door while I make sure I don't have food in my braces. 
And I got a victory point for the most roads connecting settlements.
Nobody my age would go out with me 'cause I'm too ugly.
What the hell is wrong with you?! How come you're not yelling and whining?!
Hey Eric! Your mom's been in an accident!
You little jerk!  You were trying to kill grampa! I'm telling mom!
You're a turd! You're the Turdman of Alcatraz!
You're right! He is a scumbag! I wish I could get him back! I just don't know how.
No! It's Eric's fault. He let those cats in here.
It's working! I can i-chat with my darling Amir now! 
Mom, Dad, Kelly and Stacy are going to the Women of Rock concert! Can I go with them?! 
You'll never be bigger than me Stan.  Never!
Turd wedgie. Come in the kitchen, Skyler. There's refreshments 
Uhwwell, okay.  I'll try. But I'm not promising anything. 
1, 2, 3, 4
So much pain in the world today.
Too many turds are headin' my way.
But we can press our turds together.
Passing by turds whenever.
Ohh boy, you are gonna get it now. 
Life so full of happiness?
Feel free to mark my words.
But me and you, will my love do
in a world that's full of turds? TURDS!
llama judgin finger-lovin' turds. TURDS!
Well, I do have a song I wrote.
Ooo, Stan's in trouble. Let me kick his ass, Mom.
We need to run over to the hospital and identify her body! We'll be right back.
No, Skyler, I'm not putting out for you!
HAha! I knew you sent the cat, and that's why I went outside and got him!
...But when you've seen one turd, you've seen them all.  ...stupid turd! The one night-
Maybe you should let your son decide that for himself. 
We're going outside to watch a meteor shower! I'm locking you in your room 'til we get back in, turd!
Stop crying, turd! Now, who's gonna kill you?
Honestly? I think you guys need some work.
Calm down, turd! No Juvenile Hall turd is going to kill you. That's my job.
I saw three ships come sailing in
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day
I saw three ships come sailing in 
On Christmas Day, in the morning. 
And what was in those ships, all three? 
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day
And what- 
Shut up, turds! 
-was in those ships all three
On Christmas Day, in the morning?
The Virgin Mary and Christ were there 
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day 
The Virgin Mary and-
Shut up, TUUUURDS! 
-Christ were there
On Christmas Day, in the morning.
Let us all rejoice, amain, 
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day 
And let- 
I told you to shut up! 
-us all rejoice, amain,
On Christmas Day, in the morning. 
Shelly is starting to get pissed 
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day 
Shelly got up and killed the turds 
On Christmas Day, in the MORNING! 
I have to get online with my darling Amir before school starts!
I don't care.  He acted like he really liked me. Nobody's ever liked me before.  I can't believe I trusted him. I'm so stupid.
In a world that's full of turds. TURDS!
But don't bug me and Skyler! Come on!
Can't you all see I'm in pain?! Nobody understands pure love! Amir and I are closer than anybody in this stupid family! 
I just think your sound is kind of... last week.
Alright, turd, listen up! Now that your mom is gone, I'm in charge. I don't know how you treat your other babysitters, but when I'm babysitting, you're nothing but a little turd. You're a stinky dried-up stupid turd! Got it?!
Yes, but I'm gonna want something in return.
