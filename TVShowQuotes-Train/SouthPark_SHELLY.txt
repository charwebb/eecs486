Come on! We've got to get the house clean before your mom gets home.  You know, Eric. It's kind of cool that two people who hated each other can be friends.
...Oh, all right, get your turd coat. You can come see the meteor shower with us.
And I got a victory point for the most roads connecting settlements.
Hey Eric! Your mom's been in an accident!
Can't you all see I'm in pain?! Nobody understands pure love! Amir and I are closer than anybody in this stupid family! 
It wasn't Stan, he was…it was with me the whole time.
In a world that's full of turds. TURDS!
We're going outside to watch a meteor shower! I'm locking you in your room 'til we get back in, turd!
What the hell is wrong with you?! How come you're not yelling and whining?!
Uhwwell, okay.  I'll try. But I'm not promising anything. 
1, 2, 3, 4
So much pain in the world today.
Too many turds are headin' my way.
But we can press our turds together.
Passing by turds whenever.
HAha! I knew you sent the cat, and that's why I went outside and got him!
Your mom's gonna get home soon. We're gonna get busted!
Don't limit me! You don't even understand me!
Alright, turd, listen up! Now that your mom is gone, I'm in charge. I don't know how you treat your other babysitters, but when I'm babysitting, you're nothing but a little turd. You're a stinky dried-up stupid turd! Got it?!
I don't care.  He acted like he really liked me. Nobody's ever liked me before.  I can't believe I trusted him. I'm so stupid.
There is one thing I love more than Russell Crowe, and that is seeing you unhappy. So, Buffy it is!
Shut up, turd! You're going to admit to Ms. Claridge what you did!
Thanks for all your help, Eric. You know, as far as turds go, you're okay. 
I have to get online with my darling Amir before school starts!
Maybe you should let your son decide that for himself. 
Hey!  Do you wanna play Settlers of Catan on Xbox? 
Yes, but I'm gonna want something in return.
And they'd better be here when I come back downstairs, turds! 
Honestly? I think you guys need some work.
I charge $5 for the first hour, 5% bumps every hour after that up to six hours, which enters into golden time.
No! It's Eric's fault. He let those cats in here.
Your mom doesn't get home for three more hours! That's plenty of time for me to make a turd sandwich out of you. 
Mom, I'm i-chatting with my boyfriend in Montana!
...But when you've seen one turd, you've seen them all.  ...stupid turd! The one night-
I don't know, Skyler. It's just kind of strange to me that you're 22 and all.
Calm down, turd! No Juvenile Hall turd is going to kill you. That's my job.
Ohh boy, you are gonna get it now. 
Just keep the volume down! I have to go deal with Turdboy. 
Mom, Dad, Kelly and Stacy are going to the Women of Rock concert! Can I go with them?! 
Nobody my age would go out with me 'cause I'm too ugly.
I just think your sound is kind of... last week.
Haha! That was a turd trick. Your mom isn't really dead!
Ooo, Stan's in trouble. Let me kick his ass, Mom.
You little jerk!  You were trying to kill grampa! I'm telling mom!
This is taking too long! When do I get to use the Internet?!
Turd wedgie. Come in the kitchen, Skyler. There's refreshments 
No, Skyler, I'm not putting out for you!
It's working! I can i-chat with my darling Amir now! 
Well, I do have a song I wrote.
You're a turd! You're the Turdman of Alcatraz!
You'll never be bigger than me Stan.  Never!
Stop crying, turd! Now, who's gonna kill you?
I said shut up, or I will destroy you, tur-r-rd!
Life so full of happiness?
Feel free to mark my words.
But me and you, will my love do
in a world that's full of turds? TURDS!
llama judgin finger-lovin' turds. TURDS!
No, I mean, what the hell are you doing to grampa?! 
What if my sweetheart is online looking for me? He could be wondering why I don't get online with him. Maybe he thinks I'm dead.  If my darling Amir gets another Internet girlfriend, I'm gonna kill him! And you! 
Hey Mom, do you like Australia? 'Cause that was the Great Barrier Queef. 
The Russell Crowe Show? You turds don't even like that show!
We need to run over to the hospital and identify her body! We'll be right back.
Leave me alone, Dad! Stop nagging me all the time!
You're right! He is a scumbag! I wish I could get him back! I just don't know how.
Nothing, Dad. Go back to killing the family. 
...So I said, "you're a little turd!" and he w-
That's stupid! See your turdy trailer some other time!
Maybe if Larry had a nice steak once in a while he wouldn't get beat up by every kid in school. 
You can't run from your past, turds. Apologize and make amends. Then I'll protect you from this Trent turd. 
My boyfriend is coming over, so you go to the kitchen, and you make us that pizza before I snap you in half like the little turd-stick you are!
Well, let's clean up the house. Looks like everything turned out o-kay.
