Well, Jim and I have a meeting with Uni-ball in about forty-five minutes, so we should probably go now.
We should probably head on down and hook up with Jan.
Jim got us a great lead with a new rep from National Envelope. We can grab lunch with them tomorrow.
And I just want to let you know that if our branch absorbs your branch, I'm going to look for a place for you at Stamford.
You know what, Jim, I wouldn't worry about it.
Excuse me, Jan, I'm sorry... I'm gonna have to stop you there. I, um, will not be taking the job.
I just want to say thanks. Good luck.
[sounding upset] Andy, Jim, can I see you in the conference room for a minute?
Yes, I'm aware of Jan and Michael's... history. Um, I don't really like to talk about it 'cause it's unprofessional. Kind of gross.
And Karen? Let's keep it to twenty dollars a person this time.
Listen, Michael, I heard you were a great salesman.
All right. Think you guys should be all set. Oh, here's the corporate card for dinner.
So with the twelve new local accounts, we had a total of four percent organic growth, which was just above our pre-year targets.
Um... When I was in the Coast Guard, a couple of us broke into the women's barracks and we got arrested for trespassing.
So, end of day we are going to have a little diversity policy refresher, because of some more problems at the Scranton branch.  And I have a list of business startups I got from the chamber.  Yes, I am going to need someone to cold call them.
What's going on with Fairfield County schools?  Karen, did you generate that price list?
We just need a strategy, ok?  We're going to set up a trap in the gun room.  All right Jim, are you using the MP-40 or the 44?
I'm sorry, all right? It's done, it's done.
Not much, they're uh, I guess running late upstairs, so we're just waiting for the presentations.
Okay, just get it done.  Jim, will you make sure?
This is not working, ok?  We are getting slaughtered out there.
As of today, I have accepted a senior managment position at Staples.
Can we do it over breakfast? It'll be...
