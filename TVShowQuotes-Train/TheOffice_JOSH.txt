She is our boss.
Thank you.
This is not working, ok?  We are getting slaughtered out there.
Sure, what's up?
Yes.
Jim got us a great lead with a new rep from National Envelope. We can grab lunch with them tomorrow.
JIM!
Yeah, let's change the subject.
Nice to meet you.
We just need a strategy, ok?  We're going to set up a trap in the gun room.  All right Jim, are you using the MP-40 or the 44?
Did you?
Not much, they're uh, I guess running late upstairs, so we're just waiting for the presentations.
And I just want to let you know that if our branch absorbs your branch, I'm going to look for a place for you at Stamford.
Wow. Uh, sure. Absolutely.
What about you, Craig, you lose anyone?
What? Uh, no. [to Jim] Uh, I want you to make sure you call Karen and get her to fax that vendor list over.
Um... When I was in the Coast Guard, a couple of us broke into the women's barracks and we got arrested for trespassing.
You know what, Jim, I wouldn't worry about it.
All right. Think you guys should be all set. Oh, here's the corporate card for dinner.
I honestly don't. I don't know.
[nods]
Uh... we'll do it later.
Okay, just get it done.  Jim, will you make sure?
You don't snipe in Carrington, ok?
Yeah, we should go.
Well, Jim and I have a meeting with Uni-ball in about forty-five minutes, so we should probably go now.
So with the twelve new local accounts, we had a total of four percent organic growth, which was just above our pre-year targets.
Hey Andy!
They're exclusive with Staples.
Hey, Michael.
I just want to say thanks. Good luck.
Yes, I'm aware of Jan and Michael's... history. Um, I don't really like to talk about it 'cause it's unprofessional. Kind of gross.
[stunned]
So, end of day we are going to have a little diversity policy refresher, because of some more problems at the Scranton branch.  And I have a list of business startups I got from the chamber.  Yes, I am going to need someone to cold call them.
All right.
What's going on with Fairfield County schools?  Karen, did you generate that price list?
You hooked up with Jan?
Um, we should...
I'm sorry, all right? It's done, it's done.
Or what?  We didn't bet anything, Michael.
SNIPE--
Listen, Michael, I heard you were a great salesman.
I don't think so.
[sounding upset] Andy, Jim, can I see you in the conference room for a minute?
[sighs]
All right, Jan just emailed me. She wants us to meet her up front.
Can we do it over breakfast? It'll be...
Andy, it's not---
Yeah, stop by later.
Okay.
Excuse me, Jan, I'm sorry... I'm gonna have to stop you there. I, um, will not be taking the job.
Pretty good.
You know Dan Gore from Buffalo.
Fine! All right.
As of today, I have accepted a senior managment position at Staples.
Thanks, but maybe another time.
Yes now.
