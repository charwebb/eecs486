Thank you.
You hooked up with Jan?
Okay, just get it done.  Jim, will you make sure?
Fine! All right.
Excuse me, Jan, I'm sorry... I'm gonna have to stop you there. I, um, will not be taking the job.
Pretty good.
Okay.
Thank you, everyone.
Nice to meet you.
You know Dan Gore from Buffalo.
A shot of MIDORI, perhaps.
Yeah, we should go.
Listen, Michael, I heard you were a great salesman.
Well, Jim and I have a meeting with Uni-ball in about forty-five minutes, so we should probably go now.
She is our boss.
Hey Andy!
As of today, I have accepted a senior managment position at Staples.
What about you, Craig, you lose anyone?
Not much, they're uh, I guess running late upstairs, so we're just waiting for the presentations.
SNIPE--
Yes now.
We just need a strategy, ok?  We're going to set up a trap in the gun room.  All right Jim, are you using the MP-40 or the 44?
You know what, Jim, I wouldn't worry about it.
[sighs]
Can we do it over breakfast? It'll be...
What? Uh, no. [to Jim] Uh, I want you to make sure you call Karen and get her to fax that vendor list over.
We gotta go.
Yes.
All right.
I honestly don't. I don't know.
I just want to say thanks. Good luck.
[nods]
Yes, I'm aware of Jan and Michael's... history. Um, I don't really like to talk about it 'cause it's unprofessional. Kind of gross.
[sounding upset] Andy, Jim, can I see you in the conference room for a minute?
Wow. Uh, sure. Absolutely.
Jim got us a great lead with a new rep from National Envelope. We can grab lunch with them tomorrow.
JIM!
All right. Think you guys should be all set. Oh, here's the corporate card for dinner.
I'm sorry, all right? It's done, it's done.
Did you?
Yeah, let's change the subject.
Hey, Michael.
They're exclusive with Staples.
You don't snipe in Carrington, ok?
So with the twelve new local accounts, we had a total of four percent organic growth, which was just above our pre-year targets.
All right, Jan just emailed me. She wants us to meet her up front.
And Karen? Let's keep it to twenty dollars a person this time.
[stunned]
Thanks, but maybe another time.
Yeah, stop by later.
Sure, what's up?
So, end of day we are going to have a little diversity policy refresher, because of some more problems at the Scranton branch.  And I have a list of business startups I got from the chamber.  Yes, I am going to need someone to cold call them.
And I just want to let you know that if our branch absorbs your branch, I'm going to look for a place for you at Stamford.
Um, we should...
I don't think so.
Or what?  We didn't bet anything, Michael.
What's going on with Fairfield County schools?  Karen, did you generate that price list?
