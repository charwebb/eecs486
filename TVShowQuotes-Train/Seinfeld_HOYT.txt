And then what happened?

So, she pretended to trip, and she fell into your breasts?
And what's your occupation?
It's okay.
So George Costanza came to work for you in May of 1994?
Excuse me?
Your Honor, the prosecution has gone to great lengths and considerable cost to find these character witnesses.It is imperative that we establish this is not merely an isolated incident. It's part of a pattern of anti-social behavior that's been going on for years.
State your name.

Call Mabel Choate to the stand.

Then on the evening of October 28, there was an abrupt end to that relationship. Tell us what happened.
So they were just standing there?
What do you call them?
Ladies and gentlemen, last year, our City Council by a vote of twelve to two, passed a Good Samaritan Law. Now, essentially, we made it a crime to ignore a fellow human being in trouble. Now this group from New York not only ignored, but, as we will prove, they actually mocked the victim as he was being robbed at gunpoint. I can guarantee you one other thing, ladies and gentlemen, this is not the first time they have behaved in this manner. On the contrary, they have quite a record of mocking and maligning. This is a history of selfishness, self-absorption, immaturity, and greed. And you will see how everyone who has come into contact with these four individuals has been abused, wronged, deceived and betrayed. This time, they have gone too far. This time they are going to be held accountable. This time, they are the ones who will pay.
Contest?
We are, Your Honor.
But it didn't end there, did it, Mrs. Choate?
Call Donald Sanger to the stand.

Anyone in this room ever delinquent?
Yes?

So you and Mr. Costanza were dating.
Call George Steinbrenner to the stand.
Alright, Detective, then what happened?
Your Honor, with the court's permission, we would like to play back that video and enter it into evidence as Exhibit A.
Uromycitisis! I wonder if they're having any trouble controlling themselves during this trial? Perhaps these two hooligans would like to have a pee party right here in the courtroom!
