Call George Steinbrenner to the stand.
Why would she do something like that?
So, she pretended to trip, and she fell into your breasts?
What was the nature of the contest?
Uromycitisis! I wonder if they're having any trouble controlling themselves during this trial? Perhaps these two hooligans would like to have a pee party right here in the courtroom!
Let the record show that she is pointing at Mr. Seinfeld.
Call Sidra Holland to the stand.
Anyone in this room ever delinquent?
And what's your connection to the defendant?
Call Yev Kassem to the stand.
Your marble rye?
So they just stood there and did nothing?
What do you call them?
So they got Jackie Chiles, huh? (Sets down the newspaper) Uh hmm. You know what that means. This whole place is going to be swarming with media by the time this thing is over. You're not going to be able to find a hotel room in this town. The whole country is going to be watching us. Now we got to do whatever it takes to win it, no matter what the cost. The big issue in this trial is going to be character. I want you to find out everything you can about these people - and I mean everything.
And then you left the bakery.
Call Donald Sanger to the stand.
So Mr. Costanza parked in a handicapped spot, and as a result you got in an accident, and your wheelchair was destroyed?
Ladies and gentlemen, last year, our City Council by a vote of twelve to two, passed a Good Samaritan Law. Now, essentially, we made it a crime to ignore a fellow human being in trouble. Now this group from New York not only ignored, but, as we will prove, they actually mocked the victim as he was being robbed at gunpoint. I can guarantee you one other thing, ladies and gentlemen, this is not the first time they have behaved in this manner. On the contrary, they have quite a record of mocking and maligning. This is a history of selfishness, self-absorption, immaturity, and greed. And you will see how everyone who has come into contact with these four individuals has been abused, wronged, deceived and betrayed. This time, they have gone too far. This time they are going to be held accountable. This time, they are the ones who will pay.
State your name.
It's okay.
What did he want?
So Cosmo Kramer was, in fact, a pimp.
We are, Your Honor.
And what's your occupation?
So you met Jerry Seinfeld in a health club sometime in 1993?
No further questions.
Cock fighting?
A what?
Call Mabel Choate to the stand.
So they were just standing there?
Would you describe the circumstances of that meeting.
The state calls Mr. Babu Bhatt to the stand.
But it didn't end there, did it, Mrs. Choate?
We are, Your Honor. Call Officer Matt Vogel to the stand.
Your Honor, the prosecution has gone to great lengths and considerable cost to find these character witnesses.It is imperative that we establish this is not merely an isolated incident. It's part of a pattern of anti-social behavior that's been going on for years.
Did one of them have a video camera?
And then what happened?
So you broke the news to Mr. Costanza? Could you tell the court, please, what his reaction was?
How do you know the defendants?
I call Marla Penny to the stand.
And then what happened?
Yes?
No further questions.
You came a long way to be here today, haven't you?
And then Mr. Kramer gave you a used wheelchair?
State your name.
Contest?
How long was his book overdue?
How did she try to kill you?
And what was your connection to the defendants?
Yes?
What does a library cop do?
Alright, Detective, then what happened?
So you and Mr. Costanza were dating.
So you asked Mr. Seinfeld if he would wear your puffy shirt on the Today Show?
Excuse me?
What was that?
Your Honor, with the court's permission, we would like to play back that video and enter it into evidence as Exhibit A.
And you also met Miss Benes in that same health club?
So Donald, would you please tell the court about the incident that occurred in your house, October 7th, 1992.
