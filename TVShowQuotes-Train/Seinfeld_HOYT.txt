And you also met Miss Benes in that same health club?
Now, Mrs. Choate, would you please tell the court what happen the evening of January 4th.
So Donald, would you please tell the court about the incident that occurred in your house, October 7th, 1992.
Would you describe the circumstances of that meeting.
Did one of them have a video camera?
Then on the evening of October 28, there was an abrupt end to that relationship. Tell us what happened.
But it didn't end there, did it, Mrs. Choate?
The state calls Mr. Babu Bhatt to the stand.
You came a long way to be here today, haven't you?
So George Costanza came to work for you in May of 1994?
Uromycitisis! I wonder if they're having any trouble controlling themselves during this trial? Perhaps these two hooligans would like to have a pee party right here in the courtroom!
So Mr. Costanza parked in a handicapped spot, and as a result you got in an accident, and your wheelchair was destroyed?
So they just stood there and did nothing?
So Cosmo Kramer was, in fact, a pimp.
So, she pretended to trip, and she fell into your breasts?
Let the record show that she is pointing at Mr. Seinfeld.
Your Honor, the prosecution has gone to great lengths and considerable cost to find these character witnesses.It is imperative that we establish this is not merely an isolated incident. It's part of a pattern of anti-social behavior that's been going on for years.
So you were the doctor on duty the night Susan Ross died?
Your Honor, with the court's permission, we would like to play back that video and enter it into evidence as Exhibit A.
We are, Your Honor. Call Officer Matt Vogel to the stand.
So you asked Mr. Seinfeld if he would wear your puffy shirt on the Today Show?
And then Mr. Kramer gave you a used wheelchair?
And what was your connection to the defendants?
So they got Jackie Chiles, huh? (Sets down the newspaper) Uh hmm. You know what that means. This whole place is going to be swarming with media by the time this thing is over. You're not going to be able to find a hotel room in this town. The whole country is going to be watching us. Now we got to do whatever it takes to win it, no matter what the cost. The big issue in this trial is going to be character. I want you to find out everything you can about these people - and I mean everything.
Ladies and gentlemen, last year, our City Council by a vote of twelve to two, passed a Good Samaritan Law. Now, essentially, we made it a crime to ignore a fellow human being in trouble. Now this group from New York not only ignored, but, as we will prove, they actually mocked the victim as he was being robbed at gunpoint. I can guarantee you one other thing, ladies and gentlemen, this is not the first time they have behaved in this manner. On the contrary, they have quite a record of mocking and maligning. This is a history of selfishness, self-absorption, immaturity, and greed. And you will see how everyone who has come into contact with these four individuals has been abused, wronged, deceived and betrayed. This time, they have gone too far. This time they are going to be held accountable. This time, they are the ones who will pay.
