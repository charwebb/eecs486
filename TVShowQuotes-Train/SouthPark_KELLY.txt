Okay, Benny. So in order for our long-distance relationship to work, we'll have to call each other every other day.
I wanna go home!  I hate the rainforest!
Yeah. I mean, I think we communicate really well.
Oh, but you're only going to leave me.
Oh Lenny, hold me.  No, I can't get attached.  Oh, but I do like you.
It's the beginning of a whole new life for you, Stan. See ya afterwards.
Well, besides a little loneliness waiting for Daddy to come home, I guess we're both okay.
Larry, if we make it out of this, I want to be your girlfriend. Even if we do live in different places, I don't care! 
Well I think that what you gals are doing for the feminist movement is amazing. And that's why women all over America stand behind you. 
Luck had nothing to do with it, Travis.  You okay?
Brian's gonna give you your personality test and then let you know some things about Scientology.
Wow, seeing a place like this really makes you appreciate living in America, huh?
Somebody kidnapped Jambu, took him right out of the park.
Oh no, that big thing is going to make love to Miss Stevens!
Great! I want you to meet my new friend, Stan.
No. See, if I start to like you too much,  I'm only going to get my heart broken. 'Cause we live on opposite ends of the country.  Once this choir tour is over, we'll never see each other again.  And that would devastate me.  So I can't have any feelings for you, I just can't, Lenny! 
Michelle, our friend Stan wants to have auditing.
Aaagh!  Come on, Benny! Breathe!  Breathe, you son of a bitch!
