Great! I want you to meet my new friend, Stan.
Oh, but you're only going to leave me.
No. See, if I start to like you too much,  I'm only going to get my heart broken. 'Cause we live on opposite ends of the country.  Once this choir tour is over, we'll never see each other again.  And that would devastate me.  So I can't have any feelings for you, I just can't, Lenny! 
I wanna go home!  I hate the rainforest!
Michelle, our friend Stan wants to have auditing.
Oh Lenny, hold me.  No, I can't get attached.  Oh, but I do like you.
Yeah. I mean, I think we communicate really well.
Somebody kidnapped Jambu, took him right out of the park.
Luck had nothing to do with it, Travis.  You okay?
Well I think that what you gals are doing for the feminist movement is amazing. And that's why women all over America stand behind you. 
Okay, Benny. So in order for our long-distance relationship to work, we'll have to call each other every other day.
Brian's gonna give you your personality test and then let you know some things about Scientology.
Aaagh!  Come on, Benny! Breathe!  Breathe, you son of a bitch! 
It's the beginning of a whole new life for you, Stan. See ya afterwards.
Well, besides a little loneliness waiting for Daddy to come home, I guess we're both okay.
Oh no, that big thing is going to make love to Miss Stevens!
Benny, will you hold my hand?  I don't want to get emotionally attached, though.
Benny? Do you think we're gonna be okay?
