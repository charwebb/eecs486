No, that's not good.

Aaaaa! Lenny! 

Then why did you do it?? 

That's good. Can I tell you something?

No. See, if I start to like you too much,  I'm only going to get my heart broken. 'Cause we live on opposite ends of the country.  Once this choir tour is over, we'll never see each other again.  And that would devastate me.  So I can't have any feelings for you, I just can't, Lenny! 

You mean me or the little one?

Oh, but you're only going to leave me.

Brian's gonna give you your personality test and then let you know some things about Scientology.

Oh. 

Aaaah! Lenny! No! 

Wow! Isn't he neat, Lenny? 

I can't... hang on!

Well, besides a little loneliness waiting for Daddy to come home, I guess we're both okay.

Travis? Everything okay?

Travis!

Oh Lenny, hold me.  No, I can't get attached.  Oh, but I do like you.

My God, Travis, they're all dying!

Lenny?

I think I like you. 

Well I think that what you gals are doing for the feminist movement is amazing. And that's why women all over America stand behind you. 

We are?

Somebody kidnapped Jambu, took him right out of the park.

I wanna go home!  I hate the rainforest!

Your family isn't poor? 

Wow, seeing a place like this really makes you appreciate living in America, huh?

Whah?? Who?! Who killed him?!

Great! I want you to meet my new friend, Stan.

Me, too! 

Luck had nothing to do with it, Travis.  You okay?

Aaagh!  Come on, Benny! Breathe!  Breathe, you son of a bitch! 

Hope?

What it, it's just rain.

Larry, if we make it out of this, I want to be your girlfriend. Even if we do live in different places, I don't care! 

Benny? Do you think we're gonna be okay?

Who's "they"?!

Michelle, our friend Stan wants to have auditing.

Yeah. I mean, I think we communicate really well.

Benny, will you hold my hand?  I don't want to get emotionally attached, though.

Well don't just stand there, help him!!

Okay, Benny. So in order for our long-distance relationship to work, we'll have to call each other every other day.

Johnny?
