My God, Travis, they're all dying!

It's the beginning of a whole new life for you, Stan. See ya afterwards.

Did you remember all the choreography, Lenny?

What it, it's just rain.

Well, besides a little loneliness waiting for Daddy to come home, I guess we're both okay.

Great! I want you to meet my new friend, Stan.

Somebody kidnapped Jambu, took him right out of the park.

Wow! Isn't he neat, Lenny? 

Wow, seeing a place like this really makes you appreciate living in America, huh?

I wanna go home!  I hate the rainforest!

Well don't just stand there, help him!!

Whah?? Who?! Who killed him?!

Okay, Benny. So in order for our long-distance relationship to work, we'll have to call each other every other day.

Hope?

I think I like you. 

You mean me or the little one?

We are?

Lenny?

Aaagh!  Come on, Benny! Breathe!  Breathe, you son of a bitch! 

Michelle, our friend Stan wants to have auditing.

Well I think that what you gals are doing for the feminist movement is amazing. And that's why women all over America stand behind you. 

Then why did you do it?? 

Benny, will you hold my hand?  I don't want to get emotionally attached, though.

No, that's not good.

Aaaah! Lenny! No! 

Oh no, that big thing is going to make love to Miss Stevens!

Who's "they"?!

Oh. 

Brian's gonna give you your personality test and then let you know some things about Scientology.

That's good. Can I tell you something?

Yeah. I mean, I think we communicate really well.

Travis!

I can't... hang on!

Your family isn't poor? 

Me, too! 

Oh Lenny, hold me.  No, I can't get attached.  Oh, but I do like you.

Larry, if we make it out of this, I want to be your girlfriend. Even if we do live in different places, I don't care! 

Johnny?

Benny? Do you think we're gonna be okay?

Luck had nothing to do with it, Travis.  You okay?

Oh, but you're only going to leave me.
