Oh! I���m am so proud of you, Schru-berry blue.
We want you to win. Dwight told me about your situation. It's such a pity. Use the money wisely. [Angela looks disgusted]
Of course. [laughs] You didn't just think I was tractor bait, did you?
You need to tell him you want a deal based on miles or he can just stick that tractor where the sun don't shine.
So you're going to be paying more, but he's putting on ten times the miles and he's pocketing a profit behind your back.
All day long, it���s moo the cows and cluck the hens. Get the sheep baa-ed. Oink the pigs.
Look, we're gonna have the tractor for the same amount of work days but my dad is planning on leasing it to the Vanderkirk brothers on the weekends.
This was on the way. We're going into town after. I need yarn.
Dwight, I���m telling you about all the things that ma said after the horse kicked her in the head. Where are you? Dwight?
[to Dwight] Is there a reason that we're excited for that little woman?
