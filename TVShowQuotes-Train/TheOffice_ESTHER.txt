Dwight, I���m telling you about all the things that ma said after the horse kicked her in the head. Where are you? Dwight?
Yeah, I plucked the chickens extra fast cause I knew I was seeing you tonight. There might just be a little feather in your nuggets or a little bit of meat inside of your pillow.
All day long, it���s moo the cows and cluck the hens. Get the sheep baa-ed. Oink the pigs.
This was on the way. We're going into town after. I need yarn.
We want you to win. Dwight told me about your situation. It's such a pity. Use the money wisely. [Angela looks disgusted]
So you're going to be paying more, but he's putting on ten times the miles and he's pocketing a profit behind your back.
Oh! I���m am so proud of you, Schru-berry blue.
Of course. [laughs] You didn't just think I was tractor bait, did you?
[to Dwight] Is there a reason that we're excited for that little woman?
You need to tell him you want a deal based on miles or he can just stick that tractor where the sun don't shine.
