Ummm, no.
What, what do you mean?
Thank you.
Was it professional? No. But I work in the nightlife industry. I get hit on all the time. In my 20's it would have been annoying. In my late 20's, I find it really flattering.
You were right. [Michael leans into Donna's car to kiss her and they kiss passionately] I'm sorry.
Thank you.
You're welcome. [they hug] You're... welcome.
Oh, Friday doesn't work.
Oh my God. [realizing Jim and Pam are looking through the conference room windows]
Oh. [Michael quickly advances PowerPoint show to last slide which is 'SEX' in bold white letters on a black background and then exits the show quickly]
Okay.
[on phone] Hello?
Hey, if I said that we should go away for a couple of days, you would...
I am, but I, I gave my clubs away. I swear too much. [Pam and Donna both laugh] Hey, you okay? [to Michael, walking away disappointedly]
I told you I like you.
Yeah.
You okay?
How could you think I would cheat on you?
Mm-hmm.
Uh, Franklin Mills.
[giggles] Not bad.
When I tell you I like you, you need to trust me, not some freak. [Dwight is gulping some sort of power shake]
Oh my God.
Is this... is this the best you can do right there?
It's you. I'm married.
Hi!
Yes.
Well, won't you be at the concert?
Oh, yeah, thank you.
Oh, I haven't tried those. No.
We're going.
I'm out of here.
[chuckles] Yeah, I think I know what you're talking about.
How do you know?
Oh.
I don't have, uh, any other questions. [blind clanking as she leans against door to prevent from Michael kissing her] I'm just gonna... make my way down to...
No, I bought them myself.
Oh no.
No, y-you were... right.
Thursday works. Yeah, what do you wanna do?
Wait, you're calling to tell me that you have herpes?
Yeah.
That's pathetic.
You know, I actually got them in Philadelphia, in a mall down there.
Yeah, we should.
Bye-bye!
No! He doesn't. Are you telling me I have to get tested?
Mm-hmm.
And, um... you know I just wanted to say it was really... really nice to do business with you.
Shoot. I'm working.
Yeah, I think so.
Steamtown Mall.
Yeah? Do you need validation? We don't... we don't validate.
You look exactly alike.
You have some ancestors in common... somewhere back.
Have you ever been to Vero Beach?
[laughing] Oh, stop that.
Donna, hi.
Nope. I'm good, thanks.
You stay away from me, or I'm calling security.
Oh. Well, I guess I'm just used to the restaurant business, [removes sweater revealing her revealing top] where, if you're in charge, then you can always get discounts for the people that you like.
Bye.
Isn't that something?
Oh, hi. You work for Michael.
No, it's just in the lot, so...
Yeah I think it'll be a nice trip. We're gonna get a lot done.
Oh, great. Great, I will look out for that stuff, then.
It's like cool... 'certified cool.' I like how they say 'certified.' Like there's some consortium of... [Michael grabs the mint from Donna's hand with his mouth, Donna pulls her hand away] Michael!
[still in parking lot sitting in her car] Michael!
Who took the photo?
Thank you. [Michael tries t kiss Donna, Donna clears throat] Hmm.
I'm sor...
