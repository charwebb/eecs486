I don't have, uh, any other questions. [blind clanking as she leans against door to prevent from Michael kissing her] I'm just gonna... make my way down to...
It's like cool... 'certified cool.' I like how they say 'certified.' Like there's some consortium of... [Michael grabs the mint from Donna's hand with his mouth, Donna pulls her hand away] Michael!
Yeah I think it'll be a nice trip. We're gonna get a lot done.
Thursday works. Yeah, what do you wanna do?
Michael, I didn't think I'd here from you. How have you been?
[chuckles] Yeah, I think I know what you're talking about.
Oh. Well, I guess I'm just used to the restaurant business, [removes sweater revealing her revealing top] where, if you're in charge, then you can always get discounts for the people that you like.
And, um... you know I just wanted to say it was really... really nice to do business with you.
No! He doesn't. Are you telling me I have to get tested?
Hi, uh, Donna Newton, here to see Michael Scott.
You have some ancestors in common... somewhere back.
I am, but I, I gave my clubs away. I swear too much. [Pam and Donna both laugh] Hey, you okay? [to Michael, walking away disappointedly]
You stay away from me, or I'm calling security.
[still in parking lot sitting in her car] Michael!
Oh. [Michael quickly advances PowerPoint show to last slide which is 'SEX' in bold white letters on a black background and then exits the show quickly]
When I tell you I like you, you need to trust me, not some freak. [Dwight is gulping some sort of power shake]
Thank you. [Michael tries t kiss Donna, Donna clears throat] Hmm.
Oh, well, I can make it on Tuesday.
Hey, if I said that we should go away for a couple of days, you would...
Wait, you're calling to tell me that you have herpes?
Oh my God. [realizing Jim and Pam are looking through the conference room windows]
Is this... is this the best you can do right there?
Yeah? Do you need validation? We don't... we don't validate.
You know, I actually got them in Philadelphia, in a mall down there.
How could you think I would cheat on you?
You were right. [Michael leans into Donna's car to kiss her and they kiss passionately] I'm sorry.
