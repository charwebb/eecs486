Okay.
You know, I actually got them in Philadelphia, in a mall down there.
Who took the photo?
[laughing] Oh, stop that.
I'm out of here.
Oh, great. Great, I will look out for that stuff, then.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I don't have, uh, any other questions. [blind clanking as she leans against door to prevent from Michael kissing her] I'm just gonna... make my way down to...
[on phone] Hello?
And, um... you know I just wanted to say it was really... really nice to do business with you.
Oh no.
[still in parking lot sitting in her car] Michael!
How could you think I would cheat on you?
Bye.
Isn't that something?
[chuckles] Yeah, I think I know what you're talking about.
No, it's just in the lot, so...
Thank you. [Michael tries t kiss Donna, Donna clears throat] Hmm.
Mm-hmm.
It's like cool... 'certified cool.' I like how they say 'certified.' Like there's some consortium of... [Michael grabs the mint from Donna's hand with his mouth, Donna pulls her hand away] Michael!
You were right. [Michael leans into Donna's car to kiss her and they kiss passionately] I'm sorry.
Steamtown Mall.
Oh, I haven't tried those. No.
How do you know?
I'm sor...
Have you ever been to Vero Beach?
Yeah I think it'll be a nice trip. We're gonna get a lot done.
You look exactly alike.
No, I bought them myself.
We're going.
I am, but I, I gave my clubs away. I swear too much. [Pam and Donna both laugh] Hey, you okay? [to Michael, walking away disappointedly]
Oh, yeah, thank you.
Yeah? Do you need validation? We don't... we don't validate.
Oh. [Michael quickly advances PowerPoint show to last slide which is 'SEX' in bold white letters on a black background and then exits the show quickly]
You want one?
Yes.
Wait, you're calling to tell me that you have herpes?
I told you I like you.
No! He doesn't. Are you telling me I have to get tested?
You were right.
Hey, if I said that we should go away for a couple of days, you would...
Hi!
Thank you.
Thank you.
Nope. I'm good, thanks.
Is this... is this the best you can do right there?
Yeah, we should.
Donna, hi.
Thank you. Did I... get everything?
Right.
Yeah, I think so.
Yeah.
Was it professional? No. But I work in the nightlife industry. I get hit on all the time. In my 20's it would have been annoying. In my late 20's, I find it really flattering.
Oh, Friday doesn't work.
Michael, I didn't think I'd here from you. How have you been?
No, y-you were... right.
When I tell you I like you, you need to trust me, not some freak. [Dwight is gulping some sort of power shake]
Shoot. I'm working.
Uh, Franklin Mills.
Oh my God.
It's you. I'm married.
That's pathetic.
Mm-hmm.
Oh. Well, I guess I'm just used to the restaurant business, [removes sweater revealing her revealing top] where, if you're in charge, then you can always get discounts for the people that you like.
[giggles] Not bad.
Bye-bye!
You stay away from me, or I'm calling security.
You're welcome. [they hug] You're... welcome.
You okay?
What, what do you mean?
Thursday works. Yeah, what do you wanna do?
