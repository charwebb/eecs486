Oh my God. [realizing Jim and Pam are looking through the conference room windows]
Hi!
I'm out of here.
Oh my God.
Thank you.
Who took the photo?
Oh no.
Yeah I think it'll be a nice trip. We're gonna get a lot done.
Oh, yeah, thank you.
Bye-bye!
Yeah, I think so.
What, what do you mean?
[still in parking lot sitting in her car] Michael!
[chuckles] Yeah, I think I know what you're talking about.
Thank you. Did I... get everything?
It's you. I'm married.
Bye.
Oh, great. Great, I will look out for that stuff, then.
You okay?
Michael, I didn't think I'd here from you. How have you been?
Mm-hmm.
Hey, if I said that we should go away for a couple of days, you would...
Oh, hi. You work for Michael.
Thank you. [Michael tries t kiss Donna, Donna clears throat] Hmm.
No! He doesn't. Are you telling me I have to get tested?
You were right. [Michael leans into Donna's car to kiss her and they kiss passionately] I'm sorry.
No, I bought them myself.
I am, but I, I gave my clubs away. I swear too much. [Pam and Donna both laugh] Hey, you okay? [to Michael, walking away disappointedly]
Thank you.
Yeah? Do you need validation? We don't... we don't validate.
And, um... you know I just wanted to say it was really... really nice to do business with you.
Thursday works. Yeah, what do you wanna do?
Right.
You know, I actually got them in Philadelphia, in a mall down there.
Donna, hi.
Is this... is this the best you can do right there?
That's pathetic.
Wait, you're calling to tell me that you have herpes?
Mm-hmm.
Oh, well, I can make it on Tuesday.
Uh, Franklin Mills.
Well, won't you be at the concert?
Steamtown Mall.
Oh. [Michael quickly advances PowerPoint show to last slide which is 'SEX' in bold white letters on a black background and then exits the show quickly]
Oh.
Isn't that something?
Have you ever been to Vero Beach?
Oh. Well, I guess I'm just used to the restaurant business, [removes sweater revealing her revealing top] where, if you're in charge, then you can always get discounts for the people that you like.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
[on phone] Hello?
When I tell you I like you, you need to trust me, not some freak. [Dwight is gulping some sort of power shake]
[giggles] Not bad.
You were right.
You stay away from me, or I'm calling security.
Ummm, no.
I have a sense about these things.
You want one?
I told you I like you.
I'm sor...
Was it professional? No. But I work in the nightlife industry. I get hit on all the time. In my 20's it would have been annoying. In my late 20's, I find it really flattering.
You're welcome. [they hug] You're... welcome.
I don't have, uh, any other questions. [blind clanking as she leans against door to prevent from Michael kissing her] I'm just gonna... make my way down to...
Shoot. I'm working.
You look exactly alike.
You have some ancestors in common... somewhere back.
Oh, I haven't tried those. No.
Yes.
No, it's just in the lot, so...
We're going.
How could you think I would cheat on you?
