No, that's ignorant. People are just ignorant and they lie and spread rumors about me. Like, that I'm dead. But if I was dead, how could I do this?  Hoo! Dawdaby daw! Shamon! 

I wanna fuck Foofa.  I wouldn't wanna fuck Toodee. She's a dike. You can tell. But Foofa, man.  I bet she's got some sweet strange.  I don't even know what the fuck Muno is.

Oh Danny Boy, the parson's calling

Foofa's got that nice shaved strange that you just wanna get in and tame the second you see it.

Did I do good in the swimsuit category? I'm worried that little doodoohead brunette girl was prettier than me.

I see them walking around. They talk to me.

Then stop harassing me, bro! You don't know what it's like to be a baby goin' through puberty! I don't know whether to watch Yo Gabba Gabba or go out and tame some strange!

Get out of my room, Kyle! I'm playing trucks!

Who would you rather fuck?  Foofa or Toodee?

Shut up, Kyle! Just ignore my little brother.

Pee-za, Fron fries. Pee-za, Fron fries. Fron friiiies.  Peeee-zaaa

I'm totally tripping balls. I'm totally tripping balls.

No, you don't understand, wuss! Why can't you just let me grow up?! Why do you keep harassing me?!

Wee, I'm a child!  I knew I was a child. See? Come on, let's play! Let's go climb a tree! 

This is stupid, bro.  Foofa shouldn't be limiting herself to little kids. She's fuckin' fine, dude. 

You just don't get it 'cause you're a robot, Plex.

Well what am I supposed to do?! See it myself?! I'm a little baby! Who's gonna hold my fuckin' hand?! You don't give a shit about how I feel!

Get out of my room, Kyle! I'm on my computer!

You just love pushing me around! Is that what you wanna do, Kyle?! Kick the baby?! Well alrighty bro! Come on, Kyle! Kick the baby!  Come on bro! Kick the fuckin' baby! Let's see you try it, wuss!

He's right, Foofa. Part of growing up is rebelling, but I'm gonna get older whether I like it or not. So why push it? I think I'm just gonna let it happen naturally. 

Make Billy Mays go away! Make Billy Mays go away!  Make him stop!  Make him stop, Kyle!
