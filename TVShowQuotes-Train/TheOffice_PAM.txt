Angela, that���s pretty transparently me.
[laughs] No. The Odd Life of Timothy Green.
Fine work! Fine work Stanley!
W.B. Jones is renovating their offices and their construction crews are taking up some of the parking spaces we used to get.
Yeah.
Did you just buy that?
Why is there a circle with a line through it?
Forget it. I'm never gonna know what goes on there.
I don't get it.
Because they have a great design program, and I wanted to see if I was any good at it. And I wanted to work on my art, too.
I can't believe Angela. I went against my better judgment, and I gave her a Save The Date. And now it turns out she complained about me to Toby.
[running for the ball] I got it!
You came up to my desk, and said, this might sound weird, and there's no reason for me to know this, but that mixed berry yogurt you're about to eat has expired.
[Laughing]
I know.
Hey Toby.
Yes, you clean all the mugs in the sink.
OK, so then, when?
Yup.
Absolutely, it's awesome--
Dwight, get off me!
That is!
Do you think that you could send in your RSVP card?
What?  Why not?
Tie goes to the girlfriend.
More freedom fries.
Yeah. Yeah, I mean I could have used another week, or three.
You still want to have a party?
People treat us like the race on our forehead. And then we guess what race we are.
Well, I'm not an artist, and I'm not a salesman. So what would you call it?
That's OK.
The phone has been ringing off the hook. The guys in Philly are kind of going nuts.
Michael, you've had two ideas today. And one of them was great. And the other one was terrible.
Julie laughs at everything.
Bye.
O. [hits the ping-pong ball, and it hits the net] [serves] P.
Ok. All of these things are important to remember but the most important thing is no one say anything about my pregnancy at the wedding.
Ten...
Love you, mom.
You can't fire me, Dwight, just 'cause Michael's not here.
I'm good.
So someone is going to a court. Big deal.
Hey, Isabel, you made it. Oh, my goodness.
Okay, which one of these looks more right? [holds up drawing of Stanley with and without a moustache]
What?!
So, uh, biggest thing, besides not being able to get her to latch...
[to Nellie] Maybe, maybe I could, could get the ball rolling. [Nellie nods] Um, Frank? Hi. Pam. Um, I am so sorry if I've done anything to offend you. I'm sure it isn't easy for you guys to have an upstairs person coming down in your space. So. Truly. If, if, I apologize. But enough about me. Your turn.
Andy's family had a total meltdown.  His dad blew through all their money and took off to Argentina with a younger woman.
Thanks, Kevin.
Well I just want to take a minute to talk to you all about something very serious. Once every hour, someone is involved in an internet scam. That man is Michael Scott. [laughter] He's supporting about 20 Nigerian princesses.
Jim uses a 6 pound ball.
Thanks Michael.
Yes... nice!  I can't remember the last time someone made me dinner.
Sure.
And don't say that thing about how lots of gay guys have kids.
He brought a sled.
Tell them your opening line.
Oscar and the warehouse guy! Go Oscar! Go gay warehouse guy!
What's wrong with cupcakes?
I don't think you should go to Philly tonight. I think that you should stay and I think we should fight.
Aw. It's OK Angela. I have mommy brain too.
She's telling me about all her amazing trip to Vietnam, I have nothing. I tell her our printers catch on fire, spontaneously!
[everyone cheers as Meredith spins and lands on ���tiny wheel���] The tiny wheel actually does have chores. It���s so cute no one seems to mind.
I shouldn't tell you this, but... AJ won't commit to Holly. And she's gonna tell him that if he doesn't propose to her by the end of the year, it's over.
Parley?
You look great.
I'm sure she's just confused. People scratch their heads when they're confused. Not always like an ape, the way Meredith just did, but it happens.
He loves to eat.
Well, I remember why I dress the way I do at work.  But I'm gonna keep the clothes.  I mean, it'll be cool to just have some after work clothes that aren't pajamas.
Hi.
Ask if there's anything you can do.
What do you feed her?
I don't have my contacts...
So just be patient.
Michael, you need to get out of this.
Yes.
Okay.
Well, thanks for being a good friend.
Yeah, they're really great together.
I'm sorry. You guys have probably noticed my stomach's a little more sensitive lately. So, if you wouldn't mind wearing a little less perfume... and if your lunch is especially pungent, maybe have it in the break room?
Sorta, yes.
That's awesome. You want some ice cream?
Okay, it's not regulation size, but it'll do. You have to practice. You have to get real good and beat Darryl.
They have art classes?
Oh, yea!
Mm-hmm.
Sorry.
We'd love to see it!
Okay. Okay, here. Okay, so the next time he goes to the bathroom, I���ll distract him, you take that.
Michael, stop.
I'm gonna to miss Toby. He has a nice, calming presence in the office.
No, I don't, I...
Okay.
It's a nice tux.
Amok. It means, don't let your imagination run out of control.
Okay, thanks.
Oh, Mema? She's the one in the teal suit. She's the only 80 year old with no smile wrinkles.
So it's a man?
This is Michael, my boss. [she points] Justin.
Like how? Dyeing my hair blond?
Can I turn on the radio?
Fair enough. Um... I don't think you're a very good person. And forgive me, but I feel like I've said this to you before: I don't like you very much.
I know. You miss Angela, don't you?
How about a little visit?
Sure.
Hey guys.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah. What? Us?
Merry Christ--[looks up] NO! Why... why did you bring that here?
I think they were just having fun.
Yeah. I think maybe I want a 'wedding' wedding.
Okay. [picks up and reads sheet]  The Michael Scott Foundation is still in existence?
We need everything back the way it was.
Nobody!
I'm uh, I'm dating Jim.
Angela is such a liar!
We should just take him down.
Thanks.
Great.
You don���t remember?
Ceramics class. Then dinner by myself. I'm gonna watch HGTV and maybe go to Bungalow 8 with John Mayer.
I feel good. [sees a huge pile of French toast] Wow.
Um. Ok, bye.
Now.  Get good work done.  Concentrate.
I know. Now you don't have to.
Well what was I supposed to do, let you walk all over me?
[laughs] I think you have a date.
Mm-hmm. Good. Baby steps.
No, not... we're not... we're not having problems. But it is personal. And I would love...
Oh my God, Ryan! That's perfect! You have to go!
Yeah, I gave it to you.
Michael's been trying to get Jim and me to hang out ever since he started dating my mom.  I don't know.  I really hoped this thing would just die out, but today he's planning a birthday lunch for my mom and we have to go.  No way out.  No way out.
Okay, well, my confession is that today I had a sip of coffee. But that's fine.
This is so cheesy.
[Jim hits a ceiling panel] I don't think he's in the ceiling, babe.
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah, I've seen that with my kids. Um, it is tiny, but I've actually been commissioned by the City of Scranton to paint a mural-
Sorry.
She's just, she's really tentative about latching, and I just, I want to keep her self-esteem up.
Yeah. Hey, would you excuse me for a second?
Really, Jim?  On Cupid's birthday?
You're okay.
I just had a baby.
That's the other Boleyn girl.
When were you going go-karting with Darryl?
Wait, that's it? That's the question you're going to ask him?
[imitating Cookie Monster] 'Hey, Erin, You look delicious. I mean, beautiful.'
Um, what should we talk about?
I know. But we should go. We need to thank him for, you know, saving my life.
I thought we were having a nice time.
I hate the idea that someone out there hates me. I even hate thinking that Al-Qaeda hates me. I think if they got to know me, they wouldn't hate me. But Karen knows me, and she still hates me, so...
So. I've been thinking, after we win the lottery, we take our winnings....
She's talking about the handprints that celebrities make in the cement.
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh hi ,David. [Michael shakes his head to Pam] No, I'm sorry he's not back from the Civil Rights rally. I'll have him call you the minute he gets back from the Lincoln Memorial.
Your brothers took you out drinking?
I can take 3 people.
How long will that take?
What?!
Psst. Jim. [Jim turns around. Pam nods head towards her for him to come over] Um, hey. I need to give you your Christmas gift now because, well, I'll just tell you.
I love you, but I'm kinda busy. So I need you to figure this one out on your own.
I don't think we should eat Packers' cupcakes. We can't give him the satisfaction.
Well, let's play, what is it?
[voicemail message for Jim]  Sudoku. Level moderate. 18 minutes. Suck on that, Halpert.
What?
[lifting up a diamond bracelet] Oh, my God.
Oh, God.
Well, wait.
When's the contest?
It's actually based on a book called Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.
Yeah!
Hey, Cece, Daddy���s gonna have dinner with us tonight after he comes to your recital. Are you excited?
Michael likes me to run the camera when he makes his apology videos. My favorite is the one for his mother.
Hi! [smooches]
Yeah, but there's other, better people out there who are helping.
Well, the last pick-up for overnight deliveries is at seven. So you need to have them signed by then. Or much earlier.
I'm just gonna sit here for a little bit longer if that's okay. The air smells so good. I don't remember it smelling so good. The chairs are so comfortable.
Sixty-nine cup of noodles.
Last week Jim wasn���t there, and they named the company Athlead.
It was for a video.
Okay.
I have this little vacuum cleaner that's broken.  If Dwight doesn't work out, maybe that could be manager.
This is possibly our new Dunder Mifflin office.
Hey Hank.
Jim.
Because he accomplished something.
To ask for directions..
No.  No, but I'm allowing it.  Just come here.
Oh, it was this summer ���
Angela, you have to put a stop to this right now.
Well, you have good taste.
Yep, that's the Dwight I need.
Okay. You know the test booklets that they give out in all the schools. I was thinking that we could put a coupon in the back that people would mail in to us... and as, you know, as I tell it, I don't like it. Unless, of course, you are responding to it.
There is no rush to get to the hospital.  I am fine.  I'll get there.  And if I don't get there, I don't get there.
Oh, okay. Okay, I will. [hangs up phone]
No.
No, normal women don't do stuff like that. This is bad. [Karen nods and Michael looks like he's about to start crying]
Maybe more.
Yes! Because with all of your support, by this time next year maybe I'll be down to one glass of iced tea a week.
Oh, hey, I'll just be a second.
Thanks.
Let's grab some ice cream, go back to the office, and finish what we started. [others nod in agreement]
Yeah, I mean, admitting you need help is the first step!
I can't even talk about it.
Um...
A homeless person. Really? A homeless person.
Really? A beer sounds incredible right now.
Maybe. But it sounds like you're just wrong for each other.
I mean, I don't know. So... what's it like dating a cheerleader?
What?
What are you sorry for?
Good morning, Mr. Wonka, here are your messages.
Hey, where have you been all night? I was looking forward to hanging out with you.
Well have fun with that.
So this is the dream team.
Oh, are you joking?
Can you just tell me now if you're coming or not?
Question.
Unless he has a secret costume that he told everyone about except for me.
[on the phone] Sure. Uh huh.
Andy, did I dream that you were crying through the night?
Well--
Hey, Oscar, come here. Oscar, this is Matt, and um, Matt loves your pate.
Cause they're just stupid.
Ummmm...
If you would have asked me that, then you would know.
That's not a real knot. When you pull on it, it disappears.
Hi.
No, I liked him. For a couple of days. Four years ago. [Jim nodding repeatedly] You know I have a kid with you, right?
Aww--
Really?
[to Michael] You're gonna wanna look at the date on that.  Oh, wow. Look at... golfing. [to Donna] Are you a golfer?
How does one do that?
Yeah.
Wow.
Why do we have to see what Dwight says?
I can't do this.
[faxing, Erin watching over her shoulder] What are you doing?
Yeah. Hey Michael, look at this lamp. $8.00.
OK.
Yeah.
Hey, Ryan.
Pretty crazy about Andy and Michelle Obama, huh?
Austin? Maybe.
[on phone] Yes?
Uh, that is Creed Bratton. He has four toes and he fought in the Civil war.
What kind of prank are you thinking?
And I guarantee, that you will be satisfied! 'Cause your satisfaction is our guarantee! We guarantee it. We look forward to doing business with you too. Thank you Russell.
And then you stopped at the bar on the way back?
Maybe, I'm a little tired.
Angela, I'm sorry.
Thank you. I appreciate that you appreciate that.
What do you think?
Michael's got a few tricks for Valentine's Day. He found a place where you can get 12 plastic roses for $10 and he's got a great line. 'Me so thorny.'
No, that's a great idea. Let's have a code name. How about Mondays? I hate Mondays? Mondays are the worst?
Really?
Listen, I know you really like Ryan--
Please hug and kiss me, no matter how hard I struggle.  I'm too shy to tell you that I love you.'
Dwight, you may find this hard to believe, but I love my boring life.
I'm rejecting your...
I just drove twenty miles round-trip back to the office to get Michael a single sheet of white paper. So, I could have just had them fax it to me, I guess.
Is that what 'soon' means to you?
I'm still not sure why this woman is even here.
Frank and beans! [both laugh] So what'd we decide for Michael, the bottle of rum, or the seashell alarm clock?
It's cold Dwight. Just shut the door and let people come in the front.
Well count yourself lucky. Wait until you have two. That's two sleep schedules, two naps that don't coincide, I mean, you'll never sleep again.
It's nice having Katy around. It's another person for Michael to um, interact with.
Sure, but we should get to the bottom of this. Let's pick a rumor and trace it back to the beginning.
I'm sorry. Did that? That was out of the blue-
Uh... no. I just uh had some other stuff I had to do.
I'm serious, take it down or else.
[vaudeville delivery] Yee.
What are we doing?
Koreans.
Actually, I put the catalog in your hands 'cause you have to pick out a new chair.
Phyllis.
Well, of course not, but does physical appearance include smell?
Hey, Dwight. Wanna haze the new guy?
I'm sorry I thought this job was for the position of office manager.
No thanks.
Yes boss.
I���m kidding! Oh my gosh you guys! She���s obviously super cute I get it. But I���d like to point out there���s 50 pounds more of me to love if that���s your thing.
Okay. I'll go look for another one. [she leaves]
So Santa, what can we expect from this party?
Yeah, I���m fine.
I'm serious. Um, I'm really glad I came.
What?
[placing a coke can in front of Jim] Here. [Jim looks confused] Just buy it from me. I haven't talked to you in hours and it's been weird and I really want to know what the hell's going on with Dwight. [Pam scoots the coke can towards Jim.  Jim pulls out his wallet and hands Pam a dollar.  He gives the coke back to Pam]
Even if she's not getting anything?
Okay, fine.  I'll take him.
She's very religious.
I���m back. Oh, hey, look, and now it���s like a double date.
I just did not realize how hard it was gonna be without Jim. I mean, I really respect you for being a single mom all these years. It whipped my ass in half a week. I have to say, there are not a lot of people who could pull off a shaved head, but you are rocking it.
We're engaged.
Are you okay, Kevin? [Kevin gives thumbs down]
What?
Seriously? Because it sounds like one of those is better than the other.
Maybe it���s a list of people he���s gonna fire.
Maybe it'll be good because then she can like socialize with the other babies.
Yep, good.
Wait, are those Michael's Levis?
[while leafing through Michael's appointment book and seeing nothing but free time] Um, oh boy, let's see, he's really...
Hey guys, we're all gonna visit Meredith at lunch. And we're kicking in $5 for flowers.
Okay.
You will be your own assistant.
[to everyone in conference room] I have terrible news. Someone defaced my mural. They painted all over it.
Um... I just wanted to say that... Just, my Mom's coming in today.
Just don't get back together with her.
My mother, Helene. [Jim shakes his head]
I'm pretty happy these days. I'm getting married soon and I'm getting along with everybody at work.
[enters on Michael alone sitting on a bed watching Glee] Michael? Maybe you should try gong in the other room again. You can have my seat. It's closer to the TV. It'll seem louder.
Okay.
Great.
[hands over bag] I didn't, it's from corporate.
Cool! Here's a little 'way to go' gift from Sabre. [tosses Erin a Frisbee]
Okay. It's been a little more tiring than I thought.
Um, did my dad say anything about my mom?
Hey.
Dwight!  Go to my house.  Get my iPod.  I think it's on the kitchen table.  Do not touch anything else.  The key is under...
Relax?!
Oh, boy.
Ok. Um, a fisherman is walking down Fifth Avenue walking an animal behind him-
Well, you know... they don't call me the Bart Simpson of Scranton for nothing.
Police are a hassle. We settled this on the street.
Roy...
Lord of the Ring stuff? I don't know, I'm just trying to think of things that were happening at the time.
The one in the really great mesh black high-back swivel chair?
How���s it going? Everything make sense?
I've decided to show her around. She really wants to meet everybody.
Hey, thanks.
That fast?
Yeah.
Hey. [kisses Jim on cheek]
Aw, I missed you.
Oh.
The guy we're meeting with?
I think he thought his ukulele skills would transfer. [Jim leaves]
Hey, I was thinking about dinner--- [Jim grabs her face and kisses her]
Well, I wish that made me feel better. Listen, so everybody saw the promos and they're kinda freaking out. [Brian laughs] Cause it seems like you got a lot of private stuff on camera-
I can tell Michael's mood by which comedy routine he chooses to do, the more infantile, the more upset he is. And he just skipped the Ace Ventura talking butt thing. He never skips it. This is bad.
Jim set up a job interview for me today in Philly. It's um, with a real estate company, which is a great fit for me because I live in a house and I know what a bathroom is. [laughs] I'm sorry, I am just very nervous because honestly this is all moving a lot faster than I expected. And, and because my resume can fit on a post-it note.
Okay.
Just a few adjustments
OK.
Hmm, I don't, know...
Ben Franklin, do you wear boxers, briefs, or pantaloons?
Michael.
Michael, I... [sits down] I hate to say this, but... you know this special bond that you've always felt with Ryan, where, like, you're best friends or you're his mentor or something?
No.
Honesty is very important to me.
All I did was remind her that you used to treat her badly.
Jim... I am really... sorry.
Kevin, you cannot possibly save enough time to see the world.
Because of the flowers.
Bye.
Whoa, Toby.  Watch out.  You're going to violate your own PDA memo.
Stop it. [laughing]
Great.
Oh, I���ll be the buyer.
They have new phone systems now that can ring directly to a salesman, or someone presses star and they go to accounting, basically 95% of my job.  But I'd like to see a machine that puts out candy for everyone. [realizing] Vending machine.
In English, box of paper snowshoe racing.
Like... a year.
I don't know, he hasn't RSVP'd yet.
How'd it go?
Michael, it's freezing out.
But Andy does, so we have to watch it with him.
He tore his scrotum dancing.
That's dangerous.
I'm just gonna go home. My mom's been watching the kids all day.
Yeah, I love it!
My theory is that... [Jim signals he's leaving, waves bye to Pam]
[giggles] Okay, see you later.
I meant to say something earlier. I just...
Michael, it's time for the suggestion box meeting.
Yeah, but we don't have a power cord.
Nope.
Then come back soon.
Beat.
Yeah, just a little, I have a lot to deal with today.
If you���re an artist, you have to be okay with the idea ��that you can���t please everybody all the time.
[to Angela] Are you coming?
Yep.
I'm coming back the wrong way.  [smiles at Jim across the parking lot] It's not because of you.  I don't like graphic design. That's it. [laughs] Stop smiling. I really didn't like it.  It's just designing logos and stuff.... and I miss Scranton.  But it is not because I missed you. I just really wanted to come home... and I know you said to come home the right way, but you can't tell me what to do. Got it?
Jim, David Wallace is calling for you.
Yes.
Really?
Dwight, no gun, okay? Don't make us call Jo.
Okay it's my turn.
Yeah?
You're costume is fantastic! [laughs]
I'm full on corrupt!
This is a new cardigan.
What���s that?
Wow, there are, there are questions to that. Okay. Um, you know what, no questions. Last item on the agenda, Toby would like to make an announcement.
Ok, um, why don't we just finish the game? Michael, it's your shot.
I said it normal.
When was the last time you went to the doctor?
No, uh, me Stanley and Phyllis so far.
I love you.
Right.  And, you wouldn't be able to talk to Karen.
No, it has the little...
Almost.
Oh my God!
Remember, you were gonna get a new chair, and you were gonna give your old chair to me. Remember that?
[outside, on cell phone] How could you do this to me? He's my boss! How many times have I complained about him to you? No, I am not being dramatic, you are being crazy!
What? You have something you want to say?
The thing about Jim, is when he's excited about something, like the Office Olympics, he gets really into it and he does a really great job. But the problem with Jim is that he works here, so that hardly ever happens.
Ummm, I don't know.
Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam.
No, Dwight!
Michael. Morning. Hey Dwight, how are you?
Yep.
Legends of the Fall?
Then I'm gonna run fast in the middle.
It is a screenplay.  Starring himself.
So my corner's the one with the copier?
Jim doesn't let me wash his NFL jersey during the playoffs. How is this any less logical?
Don't give him Snoopy. That's mine.
Okay, everybody! After you walk the runway everyone has to vote for who gets the coupon book. And you can't vote for yourself.
Let's see.  I had an aunt that I was really close to.  She was this amazing female boxer.  Um, anyway, she was injured in a fight, and she was paralyzed.  So, you can imagine how upset I was when I found out that she asked her manager to remove her breathing tube so she could die.
[Pam and Jim hear Dwight crying] Ugh, your turn.
Yes!
I think it's interesting how Forster uses Italy to represent sexuality and passion. [Kevin dumping change in the snack machine] And that also brought up themes of, uh, you know, fate and coincidence.  And Lucy's torn between these two things.  She's torn between passion and convention.
It's good to be home.
What?
I can't do this. I had a real job. I sat ten feet away from my fiance. I had health benefits. I was just feeling impulsive. I should have gotten a tiny tattoo on my ankle.
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh, hi Jan. He's, uh, on a sales call. No message? Bye, Jan.
Hey.
Uh, could I please have your attention? So a year ago, I got my first art commission to paint a mural for Dunder Mifflin and I decided to paint the history of paper���,which was just some trees and stuff. And then someone spray painted a bunch of butts on it and I had to start from the beginning. But it all worked out for the best because I think that I���ve painted the perfect thing which is the history of us. All of us. And this is for you Jim. [applause] And go ahead! [drape drops and everyone cheers]
Hey Jim. Stanley's back from the hospital today. Can you sign his card?
Um, just something somebody wrote.
Hey, I���m the one who has to sit next to this weirdo when Jim���s away. I���m in a position where I���m rooting for Nate, and that just feels wrong. [sighs] Forget it.  I need to work on my mural. I have some pointy trees that I need to round off.
Can you believe who Trump fired?
[holds up rice krispie shaped like a star] In the name of Nutcracker Christmas.
It's Vivaldi, for Finer Things.
Dizzy Gillespie.
I kind of thought something would happen tonight too.
You couldn't fix it.
[makes magic trick hand gesture] Alakazam!
Get it, girl!
Are you inching away from me?
Alright, let's give her a break. We don't know for sure this is Meredith's fault.
I think... I mean, I don't know what it is but...
Just tell me.
Ok, Dwi-Oh, my God!
But these were not the kind of people who use their words.
What?
I don���t know, Jim -- maybe you should have been there.
0-1-7-5. Thank you. Bye, bye. [to Michael] It really makes us look unprofessional.
You ready for your interview?
Yeah, that might be weird. Overall though, we still all have our jobs... so, good news, right?
[walks away] Join the club.
Yeah, something like that.
If you talk to her, you're gonna tell her about Stanley, and that's gonna seem more suspicious.
Angela.
Huh.  Maybe I will.
No.  It just feels like pressure.
What?
Oh, okay...
It's been a really rough couple of days... This helps a little.
Dwight, what uh...
We're not laughing at you, Dwight.
[smiles] Go ahead.  I think it's your turn.
We were hoping you could do something like this���
Are you sad that Dwight beat you?
No, I mean, just 'cause we like got along so well.
Michael just rented The Devil Wears Prada. He has his NetFlix sent here to the office, and he watches them in pieces when things are slow.
Yep.
Today is my first day at my new job at Michael Scott Paper Company Incorporated. You know, Apple Computers started in a garage. And we're starting in a condo. So we already have a leg up on Apple. [picks up piece of mail] Look, it's official! [door opens, Michael is in a bath robe]
[confused] What?
Hey.
Yeah, I didn't go through with the wedding.  I got cold feet, a few days before.  And I can't really explain it.  I just had to get out of that relationship.  We still had to pay for all the food.  So we froze it.  But I'm, I'm doing well.  I have my own apartment.  I'm taking art classes.  And I have lunch for the next five weeks.
Well, I am a few months ahead of you.
Yeah.  Maybe you shouldn't fake fire people anymore.
Da-das.
Okay. [telephone rings]
Every time Michael's in a meeting, he makes me come in and give him a Post-It note telling him who's on the phone. I did it once, and he freaked out. He loved it so much. The thing is he doesn't get that many calls. So he has me make them up every 10 minutes.
Oh, God.
It's just that before, you said that you didn't want any special treatment.
Mm-hmm.
Oh, God.  Oh, no.
Michael wants a strippergram?
What?
Aw, we're doing it.
A guarantee of what?
A little different. What time is it there?
This is our first joint sales pitch. I think we're gonna work really well together.
You can have your snack in here.
We will be well-rested tomorrow.
Well I don't think you're gonna be very happy with this.
[accent] It wasn't me.  I'm not goin' down for this!
Oh right.
He is a drifter out to sea.'
[surveying an untidy office] The building���s custodian is on vacation for the month and Dwight is too cheap to hire a replacement. So, instead, we���re living in filth. But, not for long. Because I have created the chore wheel.
What are you up to?
[walking through the office, notices Andy with Erin's computer set up at his desk] What the heck! Why do you have Erin's computer!
It has the birth song on it!
Oh, he's cute.
I want to hit you.  I'll do that.
Dwight, hello.
Everything is fine.  You don't have to worry.  Try not to think about it.  She's not coming out for a while, okay?
Hey guys!
I know. Yeah, and it was going really great at first. I got video.
I knew some of it.
Yeah, I can make you a list.
For both sides. Whoever paid more.
Of course. He's one of my closest friends.
Okay.
Well, okay!
[frustrated] ���Kay.
Oh. [man enters conference room]
Win
Mose, Angela hasn't been around here much lately, has she?
I love it.
What? Dwight, you can���t do that.
See, we knew it! If he just met her, he'd understand.
Planned a wedding with him. He wanted hot dogs.
You're doing fine.
Why did you put it off until Halloween?
Okay everyone, I know we're really excited to see this movie that everybody's in, but we have to remember that Michael is sensitive, so let's stay positive! And no laughing, no comments, just positive energy and we'll have a pure fun day! Okay?
[on the phone] Yeah, that's no problem.
I think it's called 'Nibbles'.
Really. And I don't know about you, but I don't know of a lot of happy marriages that start off with an ultimatum, do you?
Of course you will.
No, no, no, it's fine. I was just commenting. We gotta get these out, open 'em up.
Roy don't! [Dwight pepper-sprays Roy]
[ascends on lift, using megaphone] Attention, everyone. Can I have your attention, please? Yeah, I don't know everybody's name down here, but whoever did this will you please raise your hand. [no one replies] Hello? This is not over. OK? I will stay up here all day if I have to. Is that what you want? [descends on lift] Yeah, I will also come down if I want to. It's my choice.
No. I have a life.
And Jim's mom suggested that Jim spend time hanging with the kids in his reading group, because she though that would be a good influence.
We stole Dwight's trashcan and she found some of his early attempts at his sign.
Okay, I'm not going.  I'm not...  It's fine.   [Jim, Michael and Kevin try to help her up] Okay, come on, come on.  No!  I am not going!  I am not going, okay!?  I'm not going today because I can't do it, I don't think I can do it.
I'm kind of in-between boyfriends right now. So I don't need anything sexy. But I do need some new hand towels. I figure I can cut up this robe.
[trying to sleep as the baby cries]  Jim, Jim, get her.
Oh my God. [mouths to Jim]
Do I at least get to go with you in this fantasy?
Okay.
Hang up. [Creed hangs up] Corporate needs you to find the differences between this picture and this picture. [shows Creed two similar-looking photos of some building] Intel has told us there were at least seven.
Because I'm never gonna act like that, even in your fantasy.
I think Michael may have snapped.
Don't act like you understood anything that guy said. [pat's Jim's arm] Good luck, wingman. [salutes]
Cool.
Yeah. [laughs] Oh we're in last place.
We need more food. I'll go get some subs and sodas.
[raises hand] Conference room?
You were scared?
I don't-
About ten?
Uh, just off the top... I think she'll be here this afternoon.
Okay.
[on phone] So, there was no sales call.
Did somebody call Hank?
Mmmhmm.
Oh my God, what is going on, is Dwight ok?
[voicemail message for Jim] Hey, guess what?  I moved my computer so I can't see Michael's head.  It's working.  I think I can have a career as a very specific type of decorator.
Oh, my God. What are we gonna do?
There is nothing dishonorable about talking about your life.  People like it.
Yeah, I'll just, I'll drive myself home.
Um, hey, Darryl, listen, it's none of my business, but if I couldn't have Cece for Christmas, I'd be really upset too.
I like it.
I know.  And how long is CJ gonna spin this whole MS thing?  How can Josh and Sam keep quiet?
I won an art contest today.
I hope you got sound on everything. I'd love a DVD of that. [at computer opens translator. Types in ���Elskere��� which comes back as ���lovers��� Pam smiles]
She still has feelings for you.
Why didn't you just say 49ers quarterback?
That's OK. I don't feel like answering phones.
No yeah. Yeah.
No. What? Why?
Hmm.
What about Ryan?
What?
I have an important question for you.
Okay. Sorry. We'll uh, we'll leave you alone.
We need an infiltrator.
Oh, Michael.
Is Jim gonna propose tonight? He is, isn't he? No, he's not... Is he?
We discuss... [Angela and Phyllis giggle] the idea of doing the party totally normal. Like, not mean. Just a regular party. [giggling stops] Not mean.
Hey, Kevin. Jim needs to see you.
Yes, please.
I figured I'd catch you walking to your car, but...
Hold on, hold on.  It isn't midnight yet.
We wrote a good review.  Under comments, we wrote, the natural aroma of the beets drifts into the bedroom and makes you dream of simpler times.
[laughs] No, I was just checking out my present. [holds up teapot]
Really!
Mmm hmm.
I-- I thought they were confused at least...
[on phone] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Just a second. Michael, it's Jan on the phone for you.
So, not the ring then? The- the- Not doing the ring?
Cool.
We didn't dance.
What about five years from now?
Nice.
Well, it does and it doesn't.
How come out of everyone in the office, I'm the only one that went with you? Is it because I'm that stupid? I mean, your own grandmother doesn't even believe in you!
What?!
Oh, no thank you.
Montana.
Hi everybody!
He told me how he felt and I guess I had feelings too, and we kissed.
I should go.
Just like now.
And you kind of torpedo every romantic relationship you're in.
Sure, if you weigh 105 pounds.
What suggestion box?
I like it so far.
Hey.
[an Asian lady tries to enter the van] Oh, oh, excuse me!  Sorry. Sorry, no.  It's, uh, it's a paper company now.  It's not for the church.
But don't you also have girlfriends in Paris?  Like a lot of them?
[starting to cry] Right.
Yeah.
It's kind of serious.
Michael, what's going on?
Hmm...
No. Maybe he just said something funny.
Guess what poster he had on his wall?
So we shouldn't help you, no matter how much you might beg and plead?
That you remember her.
Hey Angela, you wanna see a picture of Phillip wearing those little booties you got us?
I'm saving that 'cause I like it when the cards go T-ts-ts-tch-tch-tch.
I don't want to have my baby here.
I'm happy for him.  I hope he gets the job.  I really just want him to be happy.  And I know that sounds cliche.  And I know saying it sounds cliche, sounds cliche...  Maybe I'm being cliche.  I don't care.  Cause I am what I am. [thinks] That's Popeye.
Oh, boy. Maybe your heels are too high.
Oh, I���m sorry. Sorry.
I���m afraid that you���re gonna resent me and I���m afraid that���
Oh no, do you think it was stolen?
Well, ya know, Michael is a great delegator. He never does any work himself. Ever. And one time, I walked in on him naked, and his thing is so small. [quickly walks off stage] If it were an iPod it would be a shuffle! [clapping, laughter]
Wow, I thought that was supposed to be, like, next month.
Jan called and asked where you're going to meet for dinner.  She wants you to call her.
Oh, we don't recycle.
Just listen. Remember that casino night about a month before we were supposed to get married? I kissed Jim.
Katy and Jim met in the office. And now I guess they're like going out, or dating, or something. And, uh... I don't know! You know? They're just... She calls him, and they... You know, I'm sorry. I feel like I'm talking really loud. Am I talking really loud?
That's ok.  It's ok.
It's just the Scranton Times...
Really?! Who?!
And, I haven't gotten paid yet. I'm not blaming you.
Dwight mercy killed Angela's cat.  It's very complicated.  It's caused a lot of unpleasantness between Dwight and Angela.  Who are both already prone to unpleasantness.
Uh hmm.
We're in.
What's up?
Dwight, relax. It's just lice. Maybe, possibly.
We can relax.
I'm cold.
That doesn't seem fair.
Jim, you have high blood pressure.
They came up with that idea really fast.
No thank you.
It is.  Thanks again.
Just keep it to yourself then.
Shoot!
Wow,  that's impressive.
Cool... This is your desk.
Yeah, sounds good. Ok.
Dwight, there is one rule that you need to take very seriously.
Okay. [Jim and Pam hug] Good luck. You're gonna be great.
Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam.
Where are you going?
I know, but I can't cover reception. I have a ton of work to do.
Yes! They're the only two gay guys I know. But they should be together.
It says ���Lotto Pool���, right on top. [points to obvious title]
What are the themes?
The windowless building by the Baskin Robbins.
Who the heck was that?
I can't tell you specifically, but... it's not over.
I have Ben Nugent on the line, he is the top salesman in Utica.
Okay.
You know what? I-- I-- I don���t think you want to start a conversation with me about what���s fair. Okay? This is way more intense than I ever --
And I'll just watch him.
I'm gonna return it.
Oh, hey, don't fill up on chocolates. I made us a lunch reservation at State Street Grill.
$100 now for sure.
Jinx! Buy me a coke.
What? No, it's not... it's nothing.
That's Stanley Hudson.
Yep. No, no, no, I'm fine.
He says he doesn���t want to.
Smokey, the bear?
Wow. He is officially the worst human being.
I don't know who he is.
Oh, I love Chuck Close and his photo-realist paintings. But I have to work.
Yup.
Oh yeah.
Okay, umm... that would be Meredith.
MmMm.
[obviously hurt] Yeah.
Don't leave a -
Hey.
[laughs] I wish.
I would drown myself.
We said part not all.
Hey.
You say one more word; I'm stopping the car.
I know.
[sighs] It���s fine. It���s just a seating arrangement. Doesn���t matter.
Hey. You have a bunch of messages and... [sees Michael shaking head with beads in hair] that's nice. Hannah quit while you were gone. I guess she memo-ed to file some complaints she had about being a working mother? And so you might also have to be deposed.
[walking into the annex with Jim] Hey, um...
You've been to the lake before?
Oh, Andy.
Phyllis!
Hey you!
Hey, Michael.
Did you hear that?  Butt-mud Brooks.
Hey, Angela? Did you hear about the Irish-American Cultural Center mural?
I should just go.  [accent]  Where to now Caleb?
I lied about some aspects of the building.
As a human being.
This could be real. Dwight's pretty handy with computers. He fixed my laptop once.
No, I didn't.
Hey, Jim.
In Phoenix. They should really tell you that more specifically. I mean, every game is an away game for one of the teams. [long pause] Do we know everything about each other?
Oh right, okay. Hey Stanley, it's great to see you!
Is there anything I can do?
Yeah, right,' what?
Bye.
Every so often, Jim dies of boredom. I think today it was the expense reports that did him in. And our deal is that, it's up to me to revive him.
Okay.
Great.
Talk about it now.
What?
We're not dating.
Really?
Yeah.
All time favorite.
Yes.
Sounds like you're doing alright.
Sure, what's up?
Oh my gosh, wait until you. This guy was unbelievable. Ok so-
You should get more sleep.
You're holding up three fingers.
I don't know. I try not to bother him about this kind of stuff.
You can flirt with someone to get what you want and also be attracted to them. How do you think we got together?
Oh, I'm kind of in the middle of -- yes please.
But, Kevin that's...
I know it's wrong to fake going into labor just to get out of things, but sometimes it's necessary.
Cut.
No, I don't think it's a bird.
I wasn't really going for anything.
That's not bad. Hey, do you do weddings?
Angela.
It's okay.
Oh, wait, I gotta go, class starting. [hangs up]
What was the last one?
[to Roy in Jim's earshot] ...back so soon.
Three kitchens?
Nope. Scared of getting cut in half. Also, there's pee on the floor.
Are you serious?
Jim is great. Being with him just takes away all the stress of planning my wedding.
What? Jim.
Yeah.
[tires screeching] Oh.
No. [laughs]
Because, um, cause I'll never wonder ever again. If I did something wrong and... Now I have closure. She's happy and, I don't know, it feels good.
Well, maybe we can put the box back together.
Oh.
I might be late.
Umm, Stanley. Maybe you could just unspool a little more each time you need to...
Big day.
I really think you should reconsider.
Hey.
Are you kidding?
I want us to make it. I want a fresh start.
You came in at 10:30 today, right?
[Michael sits alone eating at the back of the kitchen, Pam comes in with Jim, Creed and Kevin] You should do more stuff like that.
Oh look, they're starting. [all watch fireworks display; scattered applause and cheers; Darryl's band plays soft music]
[whispering] Awesome.
That's weird. I mean, that's weird to have sex in the office. That's where you work, right?
One of the tickets is for him.
Okay, you guys, have fun. You too, Andy.
This is not enough for you and I���m afraid that I���m not enough for you.
Hey, Angela. I got good news today too. I won an art contest.
... We're dating.
So many memories in this old gym. Pretending I have PMS so I didn't have to play volleyball, pretending I have PMS so I didn't have to play basketball. Those were the days!
You're taking away our bathroom?
Hey.
Oh my god! Is everyone OK?
Yeah, I'm gonna do some mock ups, and then turn those into thumbnails, maybe do some... splash frames. [laughs] I don't know what I'm talking about but I'm excited.
Hi.
Michael and Jan definitely made out.
Oh, no everything's great! Um, I was just calling to see how the meeting went.
So what's it gonna be?
We need a new manager.
Umm. How many different ways are there to sniffle?
It's actually...
No, Kelly, don't.
Bye. Call me when you land.
He said he can't help but tear up when he looks at it. It's like right next to his desk. He must look at it twenty times a day.
[to Jim] I'm sorry, I'm leaving you alone for lunch.
That's cool. [opens the container and smells the tiramisu] Mm, good stuff. [throws it in the garbage]
Can you believe my boss proposed to his girlfriend in public? That is so Michael.
Just go home. It doesn't matter.
Really?
Oh, Michael.
I know. It's totally going to change the way I work out.
I know, because you're the reason we're moving.
Oh, I made us a date to take my mom out to dinner to thank her for all that extra babysitting.
Hey, Michael left early, so a bunch of us are going to go to Poor Richard's for happy hour. You should come.
That's good advice.
One is tall and brunette, and the other one is short, and blonde, and perky, and kinda judgmental.  Who do you think he should choose?
Not really, because I found one.
What's up?
You are never going to be my father, you get out!
Is it? I just, I liked our life in Scranton.
Did... Karen get the job?
Hey Michael.
Nellie, I could practice with you in my car at lunchtime.
Michael and his jeans.  He gets in them, and I'm not exactly sure what happens.  But I can tell you, he loves the way he looks in those jeans.  I know that's why he started casual Fridays.
Thank you.
And...
[walking in with a tray of six popcorn bags] Popcorn anyone?
Nice job.
[Pam and Oscar are trying to repack cardboard box] Yep, yep.
But I'm not kidding.  I really want to do it.
$60,000.00
Stanley got to go.
It costs seventy five dollars.
Okay, I get it. [Michael laughs] Why are you giggling?  Is this a joke?  [Michael continues to laugh] Michael, is this-- did I get the job?
You don't have anything you're doing?
Oh, actually she can.
Read it, please. I love amazing poetry.
Yes you were.
That's what he said.
Sometimes there's a lot of time between the calls.
It means grandmother.
[entering] You wanted me?
Yeah, well if it breaks all the way I can get you a new one.
Ok. I was thinking about wearing it down. Kind of like, I don't know, like loose with big curls and...
That's as specific as I'd like to be.
I made a sale!
Night Phyllis.
Yeah.
A dog-like obedience to authority
Thank you, Dwight.
I may have a few weeks ago faked a call from Jan in order to get out of a synopsis of, I think it was, Navy: NCIS. Since then, Michael's been suspicious.
Okay. Angela?
What do you want me to do?
[interrupting] Tell us who defaced the mural!
Thank you. Really you guys thank you. Very sweet.
OK. If I have to do this, based on stereotypes that are totally untrue, that I do not agree with, you would maybe not be  a very good driver.
Reach your arms out.
Listen, are you bringing anyone to Jim's party tonight?
We can do that.
Thank you.
It's really nice.
Ah.
Cut.
My fiance has plans for us this Saturday.  So I really hope that Dwight doesn't make me work. Maybe I should sleep with him? I'm kidding, kidding. Totally kidding.
Everyone's waiting in the conference room.
I love [leans over Michael's desk to look at his computer screen]... this idea is neat. I've never been. It sounds lovely. [meanwhile Michael looks at the pictures Pam printed out]
It���s nice to have you back.
It is totally inappropriate, but on the other hand...
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.
Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam.
Don't get on it. [Michael inches toward elevator]
K-a. 'Ka'? What does 'ka' mean?
The weirdest part is Andy. The aftermath got dumped on him and the way he's been handling it is just..so..
He didn't leave me. He just went part time. [Meredith scratches her head vigorously] Can you just fill out the form please?
Oh, yeah, no. Don't worry about it. I mean, he was being ridiculous.
Tears of a clown!
I move we sell!
Okay, great.
Thank you.
I do not.
Movie Monday started with training videos, but we went through those pretty fast.  Then we watched a medical video.  Since then, it's been half hour installments of various movies, with the exception of an episode of Entourage, which Michael made us watch six times.
[Ryan and Dwight enter] Hey, Ryan, are you ok?
And we have homework.
I don't need to know.
You're welcome.
Yeah, I guess.
It���s huge.  How much does it weigh?
I traded with Dwight. Just, I figured, you know, you went to a lot of trouble and it means a lot. And also, Roy got me an iPod or was going to get me an iPod, so ..
I know, can you believe it?
That���s regular pizza.
You put in the garbage can that was a special filing cabinet.
[smiles]
[on computer screen] I can see you!
And a soy sauce packet.
[sarcastically] Ha-ha.
Okay, Michael, just settle down.
Couple minutes, give or take.
[to Darryl on phone] Hey, you know that guy Frank who works in the warehouse?
Yes! I have been so authorized.
Michael, we already have a Santa, Phyllis.
You know what? It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.
Still no one calling.
No, no, no, no. Undo that. Undo that.
I'm gonna need the name and cell phone number of the housekeeper responsible for changing the sheets, please.
Oh, great. I forgot mine and I'm wearing a two piece.
I'm confused...
Cool.
Maybe Angela would cheerlead.
Hey, Deangelo, my mom just sent me this picture of Cece, it is so adorable.
Andy, somebody defaced it.
In his office. You can go right in.
Yeah.
I don't know if there's really a private place in this office.
Not well. A doctor won't come out to collect a check for $700.00, or $500.00 if we go with the giant check.
Ok, but listen. We just don't have the budget for it. Okay? Reception needed a computer so we got one.
He said what?
Wait. Can you back up? What's the story?
No, not yet, Michael.
Really?
It's really cool.
Go.
He's not here. I don't know where he is.
I just think somebody lost the paperwork.
That's Michael.  You're out with Michael?
Oh.
Um, so, finally, I want to thank God. Because God gave me this Dundie.
Really?
You have a guitar slung on your back. I did not know you played guitar.
When I get eight hours, compared to like six hours, like, big difference.
[whispering] It's just, like, so creepy.
No, I umm, well I'm not gonna, I'm, I'm not gonna move in with anyone unless I'm engaged.
[delivering plant to Oscar's desk] Oscar.
[stands up; gets into stance] Okay wait-- it's-- you're saying it comes from the foot.
And then my handsome husband...
Oh, my God.
Total golf text. Send it.
No. I'm such a dorky dancer.
[puts hand up for high five] Same religion.
Mm-hmm.
Yes, after my grandfather.
I mean, what the hell was that?
I just...
I don't really think we need...
Oh?
Nice.
Hey, have I told you you look really nice today?
[whispers to Jim] Hey.  Something just happened.  Dwight just told Angela that she has to deleted all of her sensitive e-mails immediately.
What is it? [Jim lifts the hog maw with a fork] Don't touch it.
Uh, Michael?
I think he meant personal day.
I'm sorry, Michael. I need you to say it. I'm so sorry.
Okay.
Oh, Andy.
Don't.
Oh, Jim I should have told you I didn't get the job.
No, yeah. What?
But the warehouse coffee tastes SO much better.
Stop that!
Do you want me to ask the cleaning crew if they stopped watering it?
Next on the list - open the mail.
Yup.
Yeah, what happened Dwight?
I have a way to make Scranton a better place, you could leave it.  [laughter]
Yeah.
Um... ���A���... ���X���? I don���t -- you got me.
I can't believe this. I mean I have never even stolen as much as a paperclip and you're firing me.
And then every morning, I'd walk out on to my terrace and I would breathe in the inspiration of the city. You know? And just gather ideas for my painting...
One, and then wrap around.  It's okay.  Hold that arm down.
[over phone] I know.
[hugs Dwight] Congratulations, Dwight.
I'm fine.
I���m training a temp to be my replacement while I���m on maternity leave. Oh I should���ve mentioned I���m pregnant. You probably didn���t notice because it���s impossible to tell I���m so small. But yeah I���m pregnant. [another squeak] Oh come on!
... still burned in my eyes.
I honestly think you're idealizing people here again, Michael. I don't think that's gonna happen.
Right.
Or chairs?
Well, get it out of here.
[sighs] Thank you.
I really doubt it, Michael.
No thanks. You got a package.
Well it was great catching up with you. And I'll see you around the building.
Oh, I can't do lunch. I was just sending you an email. Jim and I need to leave early today to meet with our contractor.
Do you think they dined and dashed?
What happened to grape soda?
No. We're gonna make it like a prank. Like order bad food, give her this passive-aggressive card.
Yeah.
Oh, that wasn't the night crew. That was Dwight.
I cannot wait for that joke to be over.
What's going on?
We already offered free delivery!
[takes the phone] Hmm.
I know how to throw a football.
I like extra cheese, too.
[walks into a movie theater showing The King's Speech]
My God.
Are you serious?
Here. Like it?
Ok, well, sometimes the gift is really about the gesture, you know, like what it means, instead of what it is.
Oh...
Yes, it is The Island Luau Inventory '07. It's actually a success compared to Disco Audit '05.
Mmm. Hmm.
I know, you don't like to be frazzled.
Why do you need to wear the holster at all?
We have an investor already?
I definitely remember your dinner party.
I...
What!?
She's listening to 50 Shades of Grey.
Mm-hmmm.
Oh! Yes! [Group cheers, Dwight moves to driver seat]
[looks at beers] Oh. [Starts to walk away, turns around] No. Actually, one of these is supposed to be a lite.
Are you serious?
[to Darryl] I think you look nice.
It's not.
Thank you.
Oscar's pate is great. I could eat it all day, every day. Mmm. How come the good ones are never straight, right?
Hey, Darryl. You okay?
Hola. Bonjour. Ni Hao.
Hi.
Um, I don't know if I really see you two together.
What did you guys talk about?
[on phone] Hey, uh, give me a call back when you get a chance. Cece did great, and I want to tell you something.
Did it help?
I guess this is just one of those days.  It'll get better.
How is this on me?
Hey I'm here to see Charles.
Um, yeah, that would be great.
Learn to cook for one!
Of course.
Really, you can���t be scared of a room full of Jims. I love the guy, but he���s basically Gumby with hair. [Darryl laughs]
I just want to say, that this was the best, Dundies, ever! WHOOOOOOOOO!!!
Oh! No, you should go.
[nods]
[Pam, Ryan and Michael enter office] Sounds neat.
Not enough though.
Yeah...
I saw you were getting along with Ryan again.
Okay, we have to get home.
Dwight, what are you doing!? We've only been in here for, like, two seconds!
Well, I'm gonna say something to the producers.
Well, it was an important phone call.
[On phone] Oh, great! Yeah, um, I'll get right back to you. [hangs up] Hey guys! Anyone ever heard of Iris Black on the radio?
Nothing.
Um... you wanna buy it?
No... [Jim leans in for another kiss] Jim---
Cece, is reverse cycling, which means she sleeps all day and is up all night. Which basically means I'm up all day and I'm up all night. And if it doesn't stop soon, I am going to be up all night.
Wouldn't we get fired for smashing all the computers?
That's it, last one.
Come on, it won't be that bad.
No Michael, why would you promise that?
[sighs] Everyone's driving me crazy.  I know way too much about Andy's scrotum.  [Jim chuckles] And my mom won't stop freaking out about my dad's new girlfriend.  [sighs] This is supposed to be our wedding day.  Why did we invite all these people?
Shut up!
That's nice, Dwight.
Yup! [Tom and Pete give Halpertian looks to camera]
There we go.
Hey.
Yeah.
What could Jim have said to make my dad want to leave my mom? And at what point in our marriage is he gonna say it to me?
He just had to wear his tux today.
I have the worst attitude of any person here.
How could we do what? [general murmur]
What?
Okay.
Okay, just so you know, it's just the students from my class in a little studio.
Sure did. I was as surprised as you, but apparently, he is very passionate about public art.
Yeah, she just went down.
Shut it!
Oscar, it was an honest mistake.
I don't really have any control over that Stanley.
Yeah.  Sorry.
Australia? I have always wanted to go there?
Hey, why is it so quiet? Shouldn't the phone be ringing? Uh-oh. Erin set the phone to voicemail.
I bet he went home.
Mmhmm.
No, not like a ham. It's about doing something, so that the person knows that you really care about her.
Well, you��� you bought the house without telling me, so I thought I could sell it without telling you.
I can't believe he's getting a CAT scan.
I don't have any DUI's so I can drive myself, but thanks.
It's just office pranks.
Mo Chuisle. He's watching Million Dollar Baby... He's gonna try to kill me.
[laughing] I'm just saying, Roy is very competitive.
We can move out.
Yeah. I'm excited to start the company.
Yep.
Hey, smooth guys.
Michael has taped
Michael.
I know.
Tightly wound?
[to Jim] Who are you putting down?
Oh ok, but in order for us to make it, there can't be any secrets between us.
Oh I will. I will Kevin. I will make that my top priority.
Okay, that's it.
You can buy new stuff but you can't buy a new party.
What's wrong?
We were something else.
I'm not going to do that.
[phone rings] What.
[Pam nods head] You should say hi. Use her full name.
Hey!
This is Pam.
What is happening there? [points at picture]
Hey.
Uh, hmmm.
Kevin, you and Stacy set a date yet?
You sure?
Yeah, okay, I���m sorry. I���m sure we can get a copy. A lot of people were taping it.
I was after your money.
Jim's in Scranton.
They say if you're nervous around someone you should picture them naked. I do not recommend this strategy. Try picturing them with more clothes on... or a funny coat.
[in New York] That's what she said! That's what she said! That's what she said!
Yes.
That'd be great.
It's impractical. I'm not going to try to get a house like that. Um... they don't even make houses like that in Scranton. So, I'm never going to... .
That's a sad story.
I'm not gonna freak her out, Jim.
I liked them.
I type 90.
Next time we're all in this room Jim and I will be married.
Yeah.
Okay.  So, I'm just not sure if I'm releasing, though.  I'm not sure if...
You are going to text me, the morning of my wedding.
One of the hardest parts about making resolutions is keeping them. In fact, most resolutions are abandoned by February.
I'm sure it was really lovely.
Oh my goodness!
Yes. Yeah.
So, mom... which birthday are we celebrating this year?
I was going to say good because I'll have all the help I need?
Oh I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
What's this?
Okay, stop.
Sure.
If you wanna do something for the funeral...
[whispers] hello!
No.
Certainly. Um��� you dropped your cell phone.
Oh, no it's not that, I've actually been thinking that for a long time, and I'm glad I said it. I just... I'm sorry if it made you feel weird.
Too late. My hopes are up.
For the record, I wanted go another direction. Which was way better.
It's getting kind of rowdy down there.
Here. [hands drink]
So what did you want to show me?
[reading from paper] Can you make that straighter? That job looks hard. You should put your mouth on that. How can you even use that one naturally?
No, I didn't mind helping Jim with his problem. That's what friends do. I help Phyllis all the time. Just yesterday, I untangled a piece of tape from her hair. So, yeah.
Did you actually try your hardest?
Mmm?
Hey Kelly.
I was in the meeting with Jan and she did say that it could be this branch that gets the axe.
Uhh, huh, ho... oooh my God, you are ridiculous!
Okay. Put everything back exactly how you found it.
You're welcome.
Thanks! Yeah, so I'm just going to take care of things around the office and get paid a reasonable salary. You believe that, right?
I'll have one.
Is he puffing out his chest?
Go!  Go!  Go!
Oh, that must've been so fun.
Yeah.
That���s sweet that he talks about me.
I don't think so, babe.
Uh-huh.
Did you talk to him?
I'm not into Jim.  Yeah.
I'm missing my scarf. Oh. [both laugh]
Right here. Little Michael Scott- [points to her belly]
[to Jim] Why don't you talk to him about it?
Great.
Oh, thank you.
We'll keep looking.
Yeah. Coward.
I was, and then they switched to Acrobat just as I was learning Quark.  I hate computers.
It's ok. I got it.
No, I get it, of course. OK. [holds out hand for folder. Jim gives Pam back the folder.]
Ten years ago, I didn���t care if Dwight  got married or died a beet-farming bachelor.  But having kids makes you so soft. I used to watch Pulp Fiction and laugh, and now I���m like, that poor gimp is somebody���s child.
Oh no, I���m fine.
Oh, no, he can't make it.
I made something for our closing ceremonies.
Well, you should cover it with the broccoli.
Don't answer it.
I can't hear anything, there's like, there's like machines going-
Cause Roy's got a truck.
Sometimes Michael gets nostalgic and he talks about the classic gang. That's Michael, me, Jim, Dwight, Angela, Kevin, Oscar, Stanley, Phyllis, Creed, Meredith, Kelly and Ryan. We're a regular Ocean's Eleven.
Dwight take it down.
Oh my God!
See, this is what I'm talking about.
No! No, I���m interested. I mean I think everybody���s interested in why they have to sing it.
For what it's worth, I liked your party better.
Hey, Michael.
Get whatever you want, on me.
Oh, my God.  I didn't even have to do the 'C thing.'
Did you sleep in cabins?
I said happy birthday.
They're on the supply shelf.
Oh, hey, if you go by the Banshee Pub, tell the Man In Black I say hello.
Agreed.  But that's all, okay.
Mhmm, And I'm gonna take you all-in.
I feel horrible for blowing Jim's prank. I don't know if you can tell, but he's mildly upset. And Dwight hasn't been messed with in a while, so he's become a monster. I need to make this right.
[to the cameraman] Did I miss anything?
Wait, wait. What's this? [holds up clipboard]
You will?
Wait a second, I thought you said that you were hurt.
I thought we were just having fun at the beach.
Much different the second time around. And I have to say; it is nice not being the only pregnant woman in the office.
I'm saying we should go scorched earth on that guy's face.
That's a great idea.
OK.
Here, uh... Meredith? Why don't you put your hazards on.
Oh... is there another wedding at the hotel this weekend?
Yeah, that's weird. I thought they only played the Police.
No. Go ahead.
[smiling] It's too much.
Um, I think I'm gonna be up at the lake.
You know, you're in a meeting, and nobody knows that you've had sex there, except for you and him.
I'm at a crucial point where I have sunk 4 hours into that copier, and I am not going to let it beat me like that wireless router did.
That's amazing.
For the past few months I've been sending Dwight letters from the CIA. [hands a folder to Jim]
I called the doctor like a week ago.  I couldn't wait...  Oh, God, don't be mad.
Oh, no, Kevin, it���s not a joke. Angela���s husband put me up for a-- um, just never mind.
I don't wanna guess.
Well thanks.
Why do you always think that girls are gonna be at the party? No one invited girls. It's just us.
[on the phone] You can fax it over. Yeah, 5-7-0-5-5-5-0-1--
Yeah. I think you should call social services.
Because some people think you monopolize the conversation by trying to be funny.
Okay, okay.
Ok, cool.
Oh, but, hey, Jim.
Michael...
What, no. That can't...I don't...
Um... Are you...
Your shirt is buttoned wrong.
I don't think an apology is enough. I really think the only way for me to learn my lesson is to take my suspension.
No! Just talk to her.
He could have broken your nose or something.  Crazy.  It's just so stupid.  I mean, getting back with Roy and everything.  I mean, what was I thinking, right?
I don't think I'm gonna make it.
I'm going into labor.
Michael Scott's Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton, Meredith Palmer memorial, celebrity rabies awareness, fun run race for the cure, this is Pam.
I'm freezing.
I sent in one of my watercolors.
There's no one from England, Jim.  Katie studied in Ireland - this is Stacy, the one who does the Murakami-style collages.
Yeah, great.
Yes, I'll be sure someone returns your call.  I'm so sorry.  Bye.
We're all in it, from like years and years ago. It's like a home movie.
Dwight, what are you---
Wow.
Good luck!
Or you proved that he thinks you're gay.
Wow! That was easy.
[looking out the window at Dwight washing the car]  Awww, he did that for me?
Absolutely. [both leave Michael's office]
[watching Michael's plane take off. Crying and has smeared make up on] No he wasn't sad. He was full of hope. About Colorado, and he was hoping to get an upgrade as an award's member. And he said he was just real excited to get home and see Holly.
Yeah, some days I never go outside.
What are you doing?
Win.
Oh, nothing.
Ah-ha.
And you thought you guys were millionaires.
[as everyone begin to leave] No, no. Come on, guys. Don't go.
French Onion?
I like to paint.
Yes, well, you guys all know Cece, but we wanted to introduce you to baby Philip.
Yeah.
You have any big Valentine's Day plans, Kev?
Ok, for the record, I am pregnant and, obviously there has been some kind of a mistake, so why doesn't Jim just pick the next highest score on the list and we'll move on.
No.
Okay.
Yeah.
Oh, hey Dwight.
Cool. Congratulations.
It's awkward asking people for money, but we could really use it. Why doesn't Crate & Barrel let you register for a toaster full of cash?
Home run Michael.
Yes. It is. And thank you so much for setting up this opportunity, I really appreciate it.
Oh.  I would like a break.
[looks up] Why aren't you as mad or interested in this as me?
[Holds the mouse trap up] Mouse trap.
I flipped through it.
Sure.
Well done.
Yeah, you didn't need to actually say it.
Yes.
Yep.
This is so cool.
Yeah.
You missed two big conference calls today, one with corporate.
Now the bronze are really blue, and they're also the back side of the gold, so no flipping. K? Honor system.
Jim...
He is in my room icing his balls.
A few months ago. I was talking to someone at corporate, who isn't there anymore, and I think the paperwork just got lost in the shuffle. Can you believe that?
Aw.
And Tom...
Night.
I've been working forever on Jim's present. He always gives me the best Christmas gifts. He'll take a memory or a private joke, and he'll create something totally unique. I love them. So this year I made him something. A comic book. It stars Jimmy Halpert, a mild-mannered paper Salesman who, while riding his bike through the forest, is bitten by a radioactive bear, becomes 'bear man'. Wreaks havoc on the office. It's really good.
Bill Bourbon was my uncle.  I would have never hurt him any more than I'd hurt a June bug.
I feel like its--
Um, Fargo, um, Edward Scissorhands, Dazed and Confused...
It's OK. You know what they say, a change is as good as a rest.
Why do you need more gas?
I'm sorry, he's not in right now.
Jim? No.
Maybe. One step at a time.
The phones are dead.
Oh, great! That sounds good!
Michael, get off the floor!
Okay, Dwight, but if you do need a key, just listen it's under the...
Thank you.
[voicemail message for Jim] Hey, what's that word we made up when you have a thing stuck in your shoe?  Anyway, I have a thing stuck in my shoe.
So..
Oh.  I think you should get it.  You've changed a lot and you'd be good at it.
Nuh-uh.
Alright [kiss]
[closes laptop] It's deleted.
Parenting? Yeah. This is Cici���s favorite magazine. She loves the pictures of babies.
You know what? I'm sick of this! Let's go, you and me!
Wow. Look at our parking lot.
What do you mean?
Oh, wow, it's almost time for ultra feast!  Where's Kevin?
Oh my God, I win!  Ok, it was a minor league hockey game. He brought his brother, and when I went to the bathroom, the game ended and they forgot about me.
Uh, we brought back some Puerto Rican candy.
Oh, I'll just time him later.
[walks in the conference room where Jim and Dwight are playing ping-pong] How's it going?
Wait! What you should do, Michael, is have a doctor take a look at it. Because we really don't know what that is.
Now that I think about it, Angela and Andy might actually make a good couple.  But I couldn't do that to Dwight... or Angela... or Andy.
I worked until about 2:45 AM. And then I had to decide if I wanted to spend the night with Michael editing in his office, and Dwight watching Michael edit in his office, or drive home and probably fall asleep at the wheel and die in a fiery car wreck. I passed out on my keyboard trying to decide.
No, that's Afghan.
What's that supposed to mean?
[to Michael on speakerphone] Ok, you want me to read 'em?
Maybe I played a little in junior high... and in high school... maybe a little in college... and went to volleyball camp most summers.
[Michael is Army crawling around the office] Michael?
Wait, when am I...? You just have to be clear and firm. You know, just tell him you don't love him. Just be honest with him. [Erin nods]
Oh, do you mean Darryl? That's a great idea. I'll ask him.
Mmm... Yes.
You know what, Michael? For what it's worth... I was wrong, too. I thought she was interested in you.
Okay.
Mom!
[Andy shakes his head 'no'] Oh. No, no. [laughing] We're not together. No, no, no. Definitely not. Definitely not. No. We just work together.
Well... I have a job right now, so I can't really take time off...
But it's free. And we'll keep our eye on them.
Oh!
Stop texting, put your phone away!  Come on.
What?
Angela - she used to stay here sometimes?
What happened?
Oh, all my stuff is still upstairs so...
Because she's conflicted.  She has to be professional, but she's fighting feelings... for you.
OK. [they begin to leave]
Is it funny? I thought it was more ...interesting, than funny. [she walks over to see Oscar at the window looking down on man catching a football in parking lot]  I think my water just broke!
I really want to do this!
Yeah, you're gonna need it.
Dunder Mifflin this is Pam. Oh, hey Mom. No, what did Dad say?
Oh, yeah, my water broke.
Ok. [Andy continues moaning]
Come on, Michael! Yeah!
I spent a month putting that rolodex on his Blackberry, which he now uses as a nightlight.
A party. It's not an excuse to get really drunk or confront someone or have a cathartic experience of any kind.
[on phone] Dunder-Mifflin. This is Pam. [listens] Uh, yeah. [snaps her fingers in the air, getting Jim's attention] Just one second. I will, uh, transfer you to our manager, Michael Scott.
Oh, nothing that exciting.
No, we're not.
Listen, um��� I was scared, you know? I loved what I had, and I didn���t want to risk it. And I think that maybe I did doubt him a little too. Which was wrong because he���s shown me time and again. But when the documentary started airing, people on the street told me that I had this fairy-tale romance. But there were a lot of times last year where it did not feel like a fairy tale. But then it got deeper, and it got stronger and now it���s better than a fairy tale. It���s like a long book that you never want to end.  And you���re fine with that because you just never, ever wanna leave it.
Really, where?
Are you okay, what's wrong?
And that was our summer.
Again, no pants.
How is that better than a barbecue?
Okay.
You know what? It's fine, it's fine. Let me just...it's fine. [Pam leaves work bus]
No, it's, that's respectable.
Also, Pam and Roy.
I'll see you tomorrow.
[taking glass] Thank you.
No, we weren't.
Um, I have a question.
Roy, I picked those flowers. Phyllis just stole all of my ideas for our wedding.
OK. I'm gonna be a few minutes. So it's only twenty past five. I still have to do my faxes.
Yes! Oh! [runs into his arms, kisses him] Um, congratulations to you, sir. [they shake hands business-like]
Phone's ringing. [goes back toward desk]
If you don't take out his battery, he just keeps going all day.
I don't think that's a word.
Everything's fine.  We have plenty of time.
Cute. [enters office area] Very funny, everyone. Who wrote captions under my doodle? I'm not even kidding. They're pretty good.
Yes.
Aww.
Why did I get in the car?  I could of struggled.  I have a whistle in my purse I didn't even blow it.
Okay.
Like the main company number? Because I'm gonna have to call information.
He's not saying what he needs to say.
We were wondering if you would like to have dinner with us tonight, in our home, and play with our baby.
No, no, no, no, no.  Oh, no. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Nooooo!
Did you do something to her?
I can't do this. I don't have this sales gene, or whatever it is. Tell me everything is going to be ok.
[annoyed] Why?
Go!
Michael?
Ok.
Yes, I have been working with you forever.
For us, um, nothing new, really the kids are great.
Some candy.
Why are you assuming you'd get the whole thing?
Uh-huh.
[to Dwight, who is reading the want ads] Should you really be so blatant about that?
No.
No.
Todd, you're just saying insults in the form of an apology.
Yeah.
You know the baby's not going to live here, right?
I���m sure Athlead will be a huge success. But I don���t want him to do it anymore, and I don���t want to give him an ultimatum, but I am not moving our family to Philly.
What are you going to do with your time off?
Angela as the nurse!
You're gonna give yourself a bonus of $645 instead of getting the entire office something it really needs?
Oh, I had a question.
OK.
So, I just wanted to confirm that you're not coming to my wedding.
Different colored paint. I wanted different colored paint in the spots where they put their paint. So, it just is... OK, the point is, these warehouse guys are vandals. And, they need to be stopped.
How sure is this?
[to camera] What? I'm not in love with her.
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. ... Uh, sure, I'll get him for you. [to Michael] It's Jan for you.
Us.
Really? Where did you hear that?
Oh, my God! It's incredible. [Jim reaches and steals his card back before she can notice it] Is this the Boggle timer?
What?
And that was fun. But what about a year from now?
Toby, why don't you open your present?
I was helping Nellie drive���[Stanley interrupts]
Listen, when Jim was dating Karen, I didn't want to come to work. It was awful. I hated it. I wanted to quit, but-
Yeah, well, you know, whatever happens. [Kelly puts her hand on Pam's shoulder] Oh.
All right, you don���t have to.
Hey Brian, you got a sec?
I think so.  I don't know, I was mainly focused on the cup holders.
I only have one goal today. To make one kid like me. Just one.
You know, there are a lot of guys out there who would just love and appreciate a-
Why was he making her laugh so much?
No, but that would've been a really good idea.
[approaching Michael at elevators] Michael? [to others] He's over here!
[throws resolution board away in dumpster] Lesson learned.
That was a good example.
No, I'm sure they're pretty much the same as the English instructions.
Yes, it was.
That's okay I can... I'm fine. I'll just play a song in my head.
Yeah, Jim barely talks to Mike. We had to go through like two levels of friends to even find his profile. Jim picked someone just unattractive enough to shut me up without tipping it.
[ecstatic] Oh my god!
Sorry.
Mm-hmm.
I love you so much. [starting to cry]
[whispering] I can do it.
Thank you. I knew it.
He's gonna be disappointed.
Stop it, please.
What do you want to dish about?
I���m doing it for us.
That���s a license number?
Here's the thing.  When Michael invents a hypothetical situation, he eventually turns it into an actual situation.
Because I���m so glad you���re back, baby, but I���m just���I was talking to Darryl, and he was talking about the trip, and I just feel like you���re giving up so much.
[seeing Jim come in with Cece wearing an old t-shirt] What?
Yeah. I realize that might be harassment.
Sure.
This was tough. I suggested we flip a coin. But Angela said she doesn't like to gamble. Of course by saying that she was gambling that I wouldn't smack her.
Oh, no. I just--
What do we do?
Okay, lets go.
Wrong baby!  This is not our baby!  Sshh.
So you know the feeling.
No, nothing.  Nothing Michael!  Just saying hi. [Michael waves 'hi' at the phone]
Really?
It's really sweet.
[long pause] And of course, if there's ever anything I can ever do for you...
Yeah, he's making me take notes on these meetings and I'm, like, 'These people are my friends.' But he's all like, 'This is confidential. You can't tell anybody.' But I just feel like I want to... aaah. Just promise me you're not gonna say anything.
...Oh. That's... fun for him.
We'll go tell everyone.
I know.
Yes.  And I think they gave him too many fries.
But I'm holding on because I keep waiting for Sandra Bullock to show up.
Hey.
Oh, I don't know... [Jim laughs, phone rings] Oh my God.  This is Jan's cell.
Really?
What do you think his chances are?
About 2 months
It's only for three weeks, you know with my mom and sister at the house it'll be..
Uh, to speak my truth, I'd appreciate if you hung that up cause we were in the middle of a conversation. [Jim hangs up phone] I appreciate the sacrifice.
Yeah... you could give it up though right? And almost nobody would know.
Hey. [walks up to Oscar and hands him a report to sign]
We're having a press conference?
No thanks, guys.
You know, Angela, you don't have to come to the wedding.
Hm-hmm.
Jim's on to me.
Sure.
Hey, Angela-
Thank you.
I wonder if she'll start calling you 'Jim'.
No, the doctor said every five to seven minutes.
Uh... no.
I make that one copy, and I become the girl who makes copies, and by the end of the day I'm receptionist again. And the worst part is, I like making copies. The paper comes out all warm and stuff. And it's cold in there. Cause it's technically a closet.
We need to come up with one realistic thing that we could do today.
I didn't tell you about the crying because I didn't want you to know how upset I was. Because it would've stressed you out and you're always saying how much you don't want more stress.
Thank you.
I'm so sorry, Michael.
He's one of our salesmen.
Excuse me.
[to cameraman] What? [looks at Dwight eating a Baby Ruth] Ohhhh... Yes!  Thank you!
I knew it.
It's kind of an impoverished country.
Did everybody end up investing ten thousand?
If Dwight's about to get fired, you have to tell him. Just get the words out. That's all you can do.
Good luck, Michael.
Yeah, he came and went.
That's great.
Thank you.
Holy s*** is that real?
Hey, Abby! Do you want to help me shred some old documents? It's actually pretty cool.
Angela, I want to talk to you about something.
I have this kind of big secret about Angela. And I've been really nice to her... and I haven't told anyone. And what the hell?!
Yup.
It's good to have you back.
[crashing sound] Michael!
How about the anchor?
Yeah.
Okay.
Um, I really liked your karaoke idea.
Okay.
But, ah, I suppose the second one is the better written line.
Right.
I saw it.  I saw it, and it was amazing!  Who said I didn't see it?  Did Jim say that I didn't see it? I saw it!
When does he hear?
Super important.
Straight.
I think I've got it.
Yeah. Are you ready?
You can't do that.
I hate you.
[quietly] Not with your hands.
Here it is. [Andy is still singing] Suite 401.
You don't look reluctant, Michael. You look really eager.
I hope so.
...Would You Rather?
Shh, shh, shh.
Hi, Michael.
That's great!
Exactly.
What was Oprah about?
Things are a little slow here. And there's only so much cold-calling you can do in a day. Turns out there's no limit to the number of cheese puffs you can throw at someone's face.
Oh, my God. When Dwight said no one wants to come in on a Saturday...
Okay.
I do.
Yeah, screw 'em. Let's do this.
[sees Erin holding Cece] Oh, my God! Go, go!
We're small, but we're eager to make a name for ourselves.
Really.
Hey!
No.
Yes, it's totally obvious.
Well, I can't really imagine you yelling at anyone.
Yes.
We're really parents now.
Hey Charles.
[getting out of the car] What are we doing at your parent's house?
Well, you like that.
Ok...
No.. [in awe]
[everyone applauds] Yay, Phyllis!
Well I was taking the picture.
And brush our teeth.
Here's the story. That guy in there is Jim's childhood friend, Tom.
I'm not going inside.
Hey.
Michael! What's going on?
Oh. Why me?
Does this have anything to do with what you were talking to Andy about?
You use fabric softener?
Okay, I told her you'd talk to her.
A little.
Great. Uh, except, I don't want to be a receptionist anymore.
Jim, they refer to it as Flonkerton.
Okay, you do not have to do this.
So weird that there is no paperwork.
No.
One's good.
Darn it.
It was, sweetie.
You were in an a capella group?
I know a lot of us have been feeling under the weather lately. It's that time of year. And according to a study done by the University of Arizona, they've discovered that your keyboards have hundreds of times more bacteria, per square inch, than a toilet seat.
Oh my gosh. The honeymoon was great. We met this other couple at the resort, Frank and Benny. We hung out with them a lot.
Try a different door.
Oh, my...
A ski mask and a swimsuit.
...kiss.
Get the baby.  Get her.  Come on.
At least she lived a very long and I'm sure, a very happy life. Got you this card. When you're ready. We all signed it. We just wanted you to know we're thinking about you.
Hmm...
What are you doing?!
No, no. 'Cause the ice melts and then it's like second drink! [laughs]
Ok.  There's a transcript between a naval ship-
Do someone else.
Although, like, unlikely things happen all the time. My best friend, in High School, she went to Australia, Canberra I think, and she met this guy who lived only two streets away in America.
There are a lot of one person departments here, so, there's a lot of department heads. But I'm off to a good start. Oh, man! If I could pull this off, it will be scam of all scams. And yet very helpful to everyone.
Hey, hey, guys. Wait. Before we accept these cupcakes, I think we need to have a conversation privately in the conference room. Don't eat the cupcake.
Race had nothing to do with it. I just knew they'd be good together.
Dressing up as somebody-I mean, when has that ever worked for you?
Just a subway stop away are the best museums in the world.
No, I���m familiar with spinning. It���s just that wouldn���t work with a chore wheel because people might get the same chore-
Heading out?
She has a boyfriend. He's out of town.
You dare me? How old are you?
Thank you.
Andy.
[to Roy as Jim escapes into bathroom] Are you kidding?
Hey, Kenny.
Yeah.
...That's it. [giggles]
Yeah.
Yeah, I get all the memos. [starts to leave]
Michael.  Michael ,it's okay.
What?
... Got you.
Oh, no we're actually married. We're not brother and sister.
Maybe, but it's not good enough for me yet.
Let's get our juice on.
Um, well, I could come back as a salesman. I have experience now.
Nellie, why don���t you  tell Dwight what we were doing earlier today. And Dwight, you show us that you���re listening.
Great. Let's sing it in the car.
Talk to you later?
Yeah.  'Cause you said I didn't
Yeah, I haven't asked him yet.
Two?
That's psychotic. Do guys actually do that?
Because we're not married.
[laughs]
Great.
I was planning on it.
Okay, first off, my Keds. Because I couldn't have done it without them. [people clap] Thank you. Let's give Michael a round of applause for MC-ing tonight because [people start clapping again] this is a lot harder than it looks. And also because of Dwight too.
Are you asleep?
It���s getting tougher. I just didn���t know that it was gonna be this hard.
Kevin, do you feel OK?
Thank you. [takes bite] Oh my gosh. It's really good.
Michael, the pants don't have any pockets.
Sick, like lots of sniffling. I don't know.
You had to be there.
All right. Cool, well... thanks.
Um...yeah, I gotta, I gotta go.
Wow. Your voice is as lovely as ever.
No, they stopped making that show.
Yeah.
Yeah, well, that'll happen.
[watches Jim score in ping-pong against Darryl] Yes! Way to go. [looks at Kelly] See that?
Now there's, there's butter on my desk.
The goal of this meeting is to get everybody excited about their resolutions! Who's been good about their resolutions so far? Erin. Tell us about it.
It's still me. Uh, Jan, here's Michael.
Good, especially after I took all your money in poker.
Hey.
Yeah.
[laughs]... your problem.
Are you happy?
Would bring me a flavored coffee.
Hey, where's Dwight? He should be a part of this. Has he been acting kinda weird to you lately?
So, umm, is this your first office job then?
Sure.
Wired.
What's wrong?
So one afternoon, while walking home from school, quirky 10th grader Becky Walters finds a wounded Pegasus in the woods.  And she becomes...The Horse Flyer.
I spent 10 years as a receptionist, to Michael Scott. And I have kids now. And I just, I can't.
Yeah. Do you like to draw, Abby?
Andy, this is the deal we made.
You know, I changed a tire today. All by myself. This bathrobe's already coming in handy. [Meredith honking] Coming!
Yeah, do you mind leaving?
Hey Michael!  I have a present for you, but you have to come down and get it.
[On phone] Oh, OK. No problem. Thanks. Hey guys, WPTU called.  The interview's off. They're opening a new cupcake store at the Steamtown Mall and Iris wants to cover that, so...
Hey!  [gets up to greet Helene] Hey. Happy birthday.
You're bribing me?
Oh, tell me, tell me.
Angela?
Michael. Okay, I'm... I'm going to talk straight to you because I think you need to hear it. Michael.
This looks great, Michael.
Ah, see, was that so hard?
What's ours again?
Yeah.
I wanna do this.
Okay. How about skeet Schruteing?
Oh I can help starting dinner if you need it.
Like, he used to make dogs fight? Or he actually fought dogs?
Okay.
Yeah, he is.
Read the pros first.
Woo!
Hey.
[disapprovingly] Kevin!
Nothing.  I was just thinking of something else.
[Michael knocks on Pam's desk] Yeah? [Michael points at Pam, himself, and Meredith, mimes drinking, driving, then points to his watch and holds up five fingers] I weirdly know exactly what you're saying to me.
Oh yeah.
[laughs] Oh boy. Oh no, I���m not laughing at you. I���m laughing at, um, something that Cece did on the playground earlier -- yesterday. This morning.
Oscar, did you bring it?
[taking paper from Kevin] Oh that's mine! Um, I'll just, I'll get it out of the way for you.
Right.
Toby, you're the best.
It all started when Dwight was tapping his foot against the leg of his desk. When I asked him to stop, he said, 'I will when you lose the baby weight.'
No, three-month-old humans don't do that.
Yes.
I have to stay and retake it.
Not at all.
Oh, Michael.
No, this was the one thing I was supposed to be able to control, was this veil and-- [Jim cuts off half his tie]
[falls] Oof!
Hey.
No. It's a jokey saying. Pobody's nerfect, like I can't even say those words right. Ha.
Yeah, but I mean, if you really like this person, then you should see where it goes.
Oh, and then this was Phyllis���s idea���[shocked cheers] So nasty Phyllis!
Actually, the distractions are good.  I mean, I don't think I'm going to make it until midnight if I'm just sitting here thinking about it.
Just like no big reason. Just a bunch of little reasons.
[in Jim's ear] Ask how he's doing since the breakup.
Michael and Jan together in Jamaica. I guess I would just need a little bit more evidence than seeing it with my own eyes.
We have a meeting with an investor today.
Let's do this.
Oscar, Cathy has a question!
I think maybe there actually is something I don't know about Jim.
Guess who just got into the Pratt School of Design.
Oh, God. It's sad. It's so sad.
OK. Dwight. Are you really in charge of picking the health care plan?
[notices Michael's costume] Papier-mache?
Oh.
Yeah, Freecell.
On average, how many hours a day do you spend naked in your office? Just ballpark.
Jada, Darryl, I'm so glad I found you guys. A grinch stole the star from on top of the Christmas tree and is hiding it in the warehouse somewhere. You want to go help me find him?
Yes?
Certainly. [makes beeping noises] Okay, clear.
Good.
[phone rings, Pam answers] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.  Just one moment, I'll transfer you.
Hey, Dwight, I'm collecting resolution cards.
I think that I should help him get home.
My personal favorite is the one he made for his condo association.
Well I'm gonna start fast.
What's up?
She's up! Great!
No, she brought you drawings.
Oh. Thank you... but nobody's perfect.
Yes, let's go. [looks at Erin and nods]
[stirs] Mmmm.
Let's just- let's go.
Nellie's pretty fearless. And I think she might be maybe even almost sort of fun.
Just to reiterate, none of us is going to say anything that might indicate that we are going broke.
Ladies, are we prepared to let the Kevins of the world decide anything for us? Anything at all? We don't even give him full internet access.
We need another approach. Um, we need to fine the weakest one and separate him from the group. [they notice Nate struggling with a box] Yeah. I think if we could get Nate alone, we could crack him.
Oh?
I'm sorry.
I don���t think you guys understand why we���re doing this. It���s-
Yes, I said you definitely should go, but you wanted to visit me instead.
No, I will not.
Mmhm.
She does seem happy.
Yeah.
Oh.
You did good, Dwight. It���s okay. I mean, seriously, Jan���s not normal. Let���s just go. She���s not going to sell to us.
I have some faxes to get out.
You know what they say about a car wreck, where it's so awful you can't look away? The Dundies are like a car wreck that you want to look away, but you have to stare at it because your boss is making you.
I want you to be Grandma.
It's disgusting and demeaning.
Can we take a look at the suite now?
Yeah, yeah. Like when he presses 'Doors closed' the doors open. Or he presses 'lobby' it goes to third floor, stuff like that. Can you do that?
Could you practice on the forms?
No.
Great.
I mean, yeah.
I really hope you get the job.
There's no yelling in that, either.
[talking head with Jim] We haven't told anyone I'm pregnant.
[in Meredith's van] I have never seen so many parking tickets.
[on phone] hey!
This is happening!
Is that okay?
No, he hasn't.
How are you, Isaac? You have something in your ear.
Mmmm, that sounds great.  What are you thinking?
Your home office?
What?
I just wanted to see you!
Whoa, are those mini pizzas?
This is a ridiculously awful plan. Because you cut everything.
No!
Cheers.
Phyllis... ended up using the exact same invitations as Roy and me. So it was kind of like being invited to my own wedding. And I was like 'Wait, thought I called that off'.
Um, I don't think so, I just bought it.
And then on the weekends, would you hacky sack back to reality and spend time with your wife and kids?
Michael! [sighs]
[her text tones rings] Dwight stopped the device!
All right, what'd you do?
[laughing] I am fine.
Score.
Ok.
Phyllis, if you could switch to a different soap, just for a month or two? Yours is kind of perfumy.
Um...
He's in a box?
Shh.
Exactly the way it is.
Right. But how'd you say it?
Read article nineteen. There are suitable standards that you have to maintain the building at that includes comfortable temperatures and adequate lighting. It also means no more cutting the tampons in two, and no more tampering with the toilet paper.
HEY!  COME ON!  Let's listen to Dwight's presentation! [Dwight winks at Pam]
Wow...
This is terrible.
Yeah, I mean, if it's all the same for you.
Dogwoods, or just the Earth.
[breathless] Stop, I can't breathe.
Mm-hm.
Yes. You guys, I have the perfect idea. Ok, it will just take me ten minutes.
My Mom is coming in to visit. And she lives like two hours away. And she doesn't have a cell phone... which is cool cause it's kind of adding some suspense to my day. And I keep looking over at the door hoping she'll walk in.
Hi.
Yeah, are you coming out now?
Like what?
Um, I don't know, I'm just like, I'm going a little crazy 'cause I keep overhearing all these conversations between Michael and corporate about like, staff issues?
No!
We'll be back!
So? You started it!
We have an extra outfit in the bag.
[hesitating at the bribe] Yeah. You know what , I think I saw ONE sick day down there.
You bought me a house!
Hey. Morning.
Sounds like Cece.
If we check in after midnight, I get an extra day to recuperate surrounded by doctors.
Okay, we're going.
Flonkerton.
You're kidding me, right?
Um... uh... I'll get back to you.
Ok.
[to Jim] Just go in.  Just go in, he probably forgot to text you.
We took a walk.
[on phone] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.
Nope.
What do you need, Michael?
What?
Sounds like it.
So the sports marketing business that Jim told everyone about except for me?
No, okay.
I want her to meet Michael.
It was really funny.
Terrible.
Jelp?' J-e-l-p?
Um, usually like that.
You wouldn't understand, Jim. It's a secret.
Oh, and if he makes a joke, just laugh it up, no matter what. Okay?
Carol, you're on with Michael.
I guess you gotta move to Philly after all.
Oh, you mapquested it. It's four blocks away.
Hey honey, I don't think we should push him.
I need new shoes.
Just sent it.
Yeah.
Like Michael Scott Paper Company?
Well, I mean, How do you pay back someone for something like that? But, uh, I don���t know. I���m working on something.
It's weird. Jan use to treat Michael like he was a ten year old, but lately it's like he's five.
Is it called Ghostbusters?
Wow, an ultimatum.
It's crazy. Brian, I'm so sorry.
Yeah, he's so great. Remember how it felt when he cheated on you though?
Kelly, calm down.
You didn't see it?
Every night, Jim and I watch an episode of The West Wing together on DVD.  Um, he wanted to watch Battlestar Galactica and I wanted to watch Cranford... so we compromised.  Next we're gonna watch Cranford.
I like fire drills. You know what's the greatest? Like, when you were in school and the teacher would let you have class outside.
Good.
Okay.
Yes, Jim���s friend is starting anew company based on this idea Jim had when they were back in college.
I'll go.  [stands up, begins speaking with a southern accent]   My name is Deborah U. Tante.   Deb for short.
They said they were done with the investing and then you volunteered ten thousand dollars?
[sighs] Cece went down.
[feels a pain in her breast] Ooh. Ah-ah-ah. Ha-ha.
Angela made several 911 calls about cars going too fast in front of the building, so the police put up a radar gun. It's actually caused a bit of a traffic hazard.
Oh, no, it's just that if a vampire had to cough, he would do it like this. [coughs into elbow]
All right. You can go. Give him his gum.
Okay.
Cut it out.
Oh, which one is decaf?
Okay. So I went on the Internet, and she is not gonna find another apartment for that price. I mean this one is twice as much, and it doesn't have parking. Does she like to park?
Um... no.  No, he has a girlfriend.
No, under no circumstances can you read that letter. It's a violation of her trust.
Jim's been spending a few days a week in Philly and I'm not gonna lie, it's been challenging. Yesterday, things took a turn for the worse. I found out Cece has lice. So I was up all night disinfecting every sheet, towel, toy, item of clothing in the entire house. I'm exhausted. But don't tell Jim. He has a huge meeting today, under a lot of pressure and he's doing it all for the family.
Yes!
Entering the....
It hardly looks fake. It's so lush.
Oh, okay, uh, sorry, guys.  Just, um, keep talking.
No. Except for the pendant that you bought me. Which I love.
[on phone with Jim] He said, 'I did like Dwight'? He's gonna fire him.
Ok, well it wasn't obvious so... [phone hangs up]
So ok. I'm watching the movie, by myself...
They���re the ones who put a fish tank next to a basketball hoop. It���s like if I put a glass of milk on the edge of the table and Cece knocks it over, I don���t blame Cece.
It costs about $75 per person.
I really don't want to talk about it.  I don't mean to be rude, but I just... I don't want to comment on what happened.  It
Oh.
Oh my gosh, please, don't.
It's possible that some people thought it was your birthday.
Thank you.
Uh, yes.  Please have a seat. It'll be a few minutes.
How could I have thought that? How could I have thought that?
Don't call my mother your lover.
[on the phone] Well, I should go.
Ok, it was the second one.
Yes, this is the only time I'm ever going to make this request.
Hey guys.
Yeah.
They're so not.
Well, since we're stopped at a light, uhhh, here is...the mural I did for Angela's baby.
Hey, guys! Fun thing. The index cards on your desk are resolution cards. You write your New Year's resolution on them, I'll collect them, and then display them on... da-da-da-da-da! This! Resolution board.
Oh, my gosh.
Okay, it's just three or four steps but thank you, thank you.
[loading up car with Michael] Don't look up. Don't look up. [sighs as office workers all looking from window]
[Clears her throat] The party planning committee, minus Angela, has decided that we're all going to do Dwight's Christmas.
Yep.
Wow, very funny.
Please cut it out.
Love you.
Oh, actually I don't know what I did with the one sheet. Y'know, that's the problem. You only have one sheet.
People are really into the costume contest this year. Might have something to do with the prize, maybe you've heard of it. The 2011 Scranton Wilkes-Barre coupon book worth over fifteen thousand dollars in savings!
Hi.
You should tell him.
Wow, this place is��� so great. I had no idea ��� on the phone, you made it sound kind of dinky.
[listening in New York] I miss him.
I don't like that clip.
No, there were a lot of reasons.
Hey, uh, I have to work late.
How about green?
Have you ever had a conversation with Kelly where she didn't go on for 15 minutes without taking a breath?
I learned from Jim, if Dwight ever asks you to accept something secret... you reply, 'Absolutely, I do.'
Thank you weirdo.
I don't think we really need that, Michael.
I'm not - I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that.
Thank you.
So, um... we'll do it after work.  In the parking lot.  In front of everyone.  I'm going to hit you as hard as I can.
Well I'm not the receptionist.
Doesn't feel right.
Great.
Oh, thanks. My Mom made it for me.
Wait. I don't have my scarf.
What no, wait! You said you were gonna help us!
[laughs] I think it'll be okay.
Oh. [laughing] I really thought I didn't get it.
Oh, some guy exposed himself to Phyllis in the parking lot.
Okay. When I was 22, I worked there and everybody said the place was haunted. I didn't believe it until one day before we opened, I look up into the mirror, you know, behind the bar, and I see this old man dressed all in black, but when I turn around, there's no one there. So, I tell the cook my story...
Oh, bodes well for the post-conference room meeting.
Michael we don't know what you're talking about...
I know.
Well, he could still... I'm sorry about that... Oh could I just get you to sign this second page.
[in high-pitched, damsel-like voice] Is that right?
I have 59 voicemails.
Jan's on the phone for you.
Maybe this is good. Finding another job is a pain. There's another annoying boss, another desk, I'd have to learn everything all over again. So, there are reasons to stay.
Ready! [flips sketch pad showing tattoo possibilities] ���I���m not as think as you drunk I am!��� [crowd claps and cheers]
Michael.
Oh, right now?
Really?
Do you want some aspirin, because you seem a little fussy.
We did, but mostly because people expect us to. We're also accepting other gifts not on the registry... However much.
What is this?
It'll be ready soon.
Hey, Michael, where have you been? [Michael shoots pool ball up into their faces]
Hmm. I don't think so. But thanks. My building manager... is... You understand.
Sorry Andy.
I got goose bumps.
You can't be a part of our relationship, Michael.
Wow... I--
That movie is so scary!
Hey!
Nope.
Hello?
What is that?
Nope, that's Dr. Laura. Well, her show Biz Whiz wants someone from Dunder Mifflin to come on the air today. Does anybody feel particularly passionate about local business issues? [Dwight raises hand]
You ready?
Please? Just make sure he's OK? [Jim climbs through hatch]
Yeah.
I do.
Um, I can offer you free delivery on any order that you place today. Okay, twenty boxes? I can do... just a second. I can do 20 boxes at 43 dollars a box. Great!
You don't have to wait that long. I mean, you don't have to wait a month to ask her out. Just ask her out.
No! No!
Well, you'll figure it out.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. No, no, no, no.
Bye.
I got her.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay...  Jim!  She latched!  She latched.
Ryan, you should be more sensitive. It's obvious she likes you and comments like that, they just...
[smiling] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. One moment I'll transfer you.
We haven't set a date. [Dwight laughs]
Thanks.
Oh, thank you! I don't know why I doubted it, because I'm so clearly awesome!
Oh. That's totally cool. You can do whatever you want.
Hey!  This is not half-way!  I did the math.  I had to drive way longer than you.  Montclair would have been closer, so you have to buy lunch.
No, I know that you���re, like, happy and, like, you had fun today.
I'm a woman. I would want to know.
OK, we're leaving for the hospital at 1.
Yeah?
I reminded you last night.
Michael.
Give it back for what? What're you gonna do with it?
Hi!
Hmm.
Well, it wasn't an affair.
Cecelia.
I just keep getting bored. And I let things build up and build up and then I - I, I do something too big, like this. Who does this?
I'm full.
Yep.
OK.
Is everything okay?
Personal shopper?
Oh my God!
Ohhhhhh!
Hide, they���re giving out jobs upstairs. Why don���t you go up and get one?
Jim!
Um, about the beach...
Oh Angela, those brownies have walnuts in them and I think Kevin's allergic to walnuts. You're allergic to walnuts, right Kevin?
Sometimes I don't put Michael through until he's already said something. I look at it as a practice run for him. He usually does better on the second attempt.
Don't you think you should say something?
Once point for me.
No, no.
You promise these are confidential?
I'm kidding around.  We joke about that stuff all the time.  I'm not really the jealous type, so, I don't care if Jim sees Karen.  I care a little.
New York is so exciting. I love my classes. The city's awesome. Um, can you give me back to Jim now, please?
You have to settle down first.
Oh my God, that's a woman's suit!
Yeah.
Usually the day we talk about sexual harassment is the day that everyone harasses me as a joke.
[on phone] Look, I'm not going to tell you that we have lower prices. Is price something that is important to you? Ok, well let me know if anything changes.
Woo! Hey, I haven't gotten one yet!
Very brave choice also, I thought.
Oh, I just get those at any party supply place.
I feel like I've been kinda cold to Karen and there's no real reason for it. I mean it's not like she's ever done anything to me. So, I think I probably shouldn't be cold to her.
Kevin, you're such a gourmand.
Except where Juliet doesn't have that great a time and Romeo doesn't call back after two dates.
Dwight, I swear, we didn't do anything.
Yeah, is that a new tie?
I thought I was very specific about you not letting up a magician.
Sorry.
I didn't see you! You should have yelled ���Crossing!���
You can do this.
Michael has so many pictures of his kids he had to get two phones with two numbers and he pays two bills.
... Okay, let's go.
Oh, boy. Um���
Ohhhh! She's absolutely adorable!
So Jim and I are getting married and the wedding's really expensive.  So I tried to get a job on the weekends to earn extra money.  I applied to Old Navy, Target and Wal-mart.  None of 'em called me back.  Not even for an interview.
Because we're usually not on the same page.
Because you're very important?
There's a plan.
No. We're not gonna hire Ryan.
In my sleep.
[voicemail message for Jim] Hey, I have a chance to sneak out of here early, and I'm not messing this up, so I'll see you tomorrow.
Maybe Michael has a point. I mean, if she was really that upset, she wouldn't still be here.
I���ll come visit you.
Maybe we'll use a DJ. That's the one thing Roy's in charge of for this wedding but all he's managed to do is set a date.
Jim, just don't think of it as degrading. Think of it as, you happen to be moving the six inches his way and he happens to be biting it.
About when you want to give me more of your money?
Shut up. I'm trying to be serious.
The thing I like most about Recyclops is that he's creating a different world for our child.
No it's not.
I'm sorry, can we just hurry this up? I've got a game to get back to.
Yeah���turn signal. It's exciting to be painting again���those are the wipers. So���the���its���just. There you go! Yeah. [chuckles]  Yeah, things get so busy with the kids���red light���that it's nice to have that creative outlet���red light! Red light! Red! Red!
I don't think those were yours to take.
Uh, could we come in too? Just for some water.
What did you say to my dad?
Jim. [motions him over]
Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. Uh... hold, please.
Uh, I'm sorry Andy, but this is a closed club.
Thank, Michael.
I'd also like to say a few words if that's okay.
Hot tie guy.
Right? Thank you! It���s just Philly. Everyone���s acting like it���s New York or Paris or London.
No...
[reading from Michael's flier] 'Drugs: Let's not and say we did.' I think Michael was high when he wrote this.
I'm all over it.
Last night? Let's see.
Look at this.
Not the car!
[Ryan and Kelly make out in the nook] But she's had a bad influence. She's like an addict. [Ryan and Kelly argue] And I just had to get her clean.
I'm supposed to turn the lock when I leave, it's part of my job.
Just let him flirt with her. People meet each other all sorts of ways.
Dwight, what...
But not everyone...
Well, other things you can do to help cut down on the spread of disease are to wash your hands regularly. Don't come in if you're sick.
Or even uses the copier every day.
Okay.
It's behind you.
Yes, and there���s nothing you could say that would get me to run the slightest risk of losing it.
I think they're even. At various times you gave Jim ten points, Dwight a gold star, and Stanley a thumbs up. And I don't really know how to compare those units.
What possible explanation could you have for possibly being here? I don't... you know, babies shouldn't have ice cream, by the way.
Thanks.  My costume's getting a lot of attention. [Pam is dressed as Charlie Chaplin]
Okay, everyone, I've tallied the votes, and the winner... of the costume celebration spectacular... and the Scranton Wilkes-Barre coupon book... Oscar Martinez.
Oh, haha. Oh well. Pobody's nerfect, right?
Well, my dad can't hear a thing. You could boom his whole life for him.
Dwight, stop. I'm not kidding, I mean, I need you to take care of yourself. What would we do if something happened to you?
Oh, okay.  Well, Michael wants to see everyone in the conference room. [Jim shakes his head. Seems relieved to be getting away from Kelly] But you know what? We have a few minutes so you guys should definitely finish up your conversation. [Jim nods his head as if to say, 'Gee, thanks, Pam.']
I think you're thinking of The Hunt for Red October.
Oh.
Michael, Jan's on line two.
When you're a kid you assume your parents are soul mates. My kids are gonna be right about that. I guess it also means that sometimes love affairs look different to the people inside them. [Andy is in the background, looks incredulous]
Thanks.
Yay Kevin. Whoo hoo for Kevin! For stinking up the bathroom.
They don't hate you.
[to Toby] Thank you!
What do you mean?
Yeah, I think I made the right choice.
Love you.
I'm more of a dog person.
No...
I know. I don't care.
Don't tell him I said this, but I always thought he was kinda cute.
What do you want to say, Michael?
Michael sends me a postcard from every vacation he goes on. Atlantic City, he wishes I was here. Busch Gardens, Virginia, all I got was this lousy postcard. And this time, I'm Jamaican-him-crazy. I don't know how far away he thought he was, because he put $10 worth of stamps on this.
Oh really?
Cece was around 22 weeks, but Phillip was much earlier.
OK. New topic. Kelly, how are things with Ryan?
Yeah.
I'd remember talking about Jim. That wasn't it.
Oh, my God.
Jelly beans.
Michael. Stop.
Hi.
[Pam sees Mose in an outhouse] Oh my God. What century is this?
How's it working?
You too.
Oh. That was like crazy. 'Cause I was...
[looking at Cece's diaper] Somebody needs a change.
Hey.
Toby, was this your fun little way of congratulating us?
Okay.
Michael, Ryan wants to introduce the branch managers in a few minutes.  You just have to wave and introduce yourself.
[pointing to staff members] Blazer. Freckles. Penguin. K.D. Lang. Holly's boyfriend. These mnemonic devices help to make a connection, and then, also to help you memorize names. I have a chainsaw! [holds up chainsaw, makes a wimpy chain saw noise] Cutting down the competition.
Maybe.
Oh, okay. It���s just that���s how Cece does it with the backwards ���E���s.
Yeah, I needed to take care of some stuff.
Of the FBI.
[pointing] Ryan!
Michael likes me to run the camera when he makes his apology videos.  He says he needs a woman's touch.
I'm Pam.
Hey!
Yeah?
No, it's passing, it's fine.
OK, I like your food.
[laughs] Okay.
Michael, this is a bad idea.
Oh, that's too bad.
[to Jim] Shush. [to Kevin] Kevin, a playful touch on the arm, or on the back, it can show your interest and it's really romantic.
Wait, um, does anyone remember when it was set up?
Okay, this is just a Christmas card from your paper supplier. No one's putting this on their fridge.
He does.
Anyone want to see the video from Cece���s recital?
Has she been on the phone the whole time?
[sighs] [whispering] Why are you still here?
I don't think we registered anywhere. We just want cash.
mmhmm.
You know, I think there could be a lot of benefits if you could learn to get along with women.
Let���s call him.
[to an off camera waiter and still clutching Jim's beer] Can I get a drink?
Oh, awesome.  You're a life saver.  [drinks from coffee cup] Wait, is this just milk and sugar?
No.  Are you kidding?
Hi everyone.  My name is Pam, and I wear glasses.
Hey Creed.
Next on the list --  song parodies.
How's it going down there?
[answering the phone] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. I'm sorry, he's not in yet. Would you like his voicemail?
[in baby voice] Hi, Michael, hi, Michael
How did you know?
You're so much happier now. Just go in there and be strong.
Hey... Happy Halloween. Jan called.
Oh! Ha, haha.
And dumping her on her birthday.
[phone rings] Michael, Carol Stills for you.
But I really think you should reconsider.
I'm not apologizing to anyone.  Michael owes me an apology.
You look real thin.
You don't have to do that.
Wow, Botticelli's, that sounds like a special occasion.
Oh, good... you're bringing Dwight.
You know, she also said the waiting list is like eight months.
Come on. Tell me.
Thank you.
I have the lowest sales record of anyone here.
Michael, you shouldn't do anything that you're uncomfortable with.
Does she smell?
And the clown?
How what?
Yeah! Oh, so I guess Oscar and Jim were talking your ear off about the new copier.
Phyllis! That's not safe.
Sorry, I ..
He's from that company in Pitts...
I am Dr. Cinderella.
Thank you.
You just... You look good. Your shirt looks... You look real good.
[pointing to the window in Michael's office] Oh, Michael marked his heights. He's grown!
Well, this building isn't far, and its much newer. There's a dry cleaner, nail place and a gym. Oh, and it's next-door to and Outback so it always smells like steak.
Hey, Good luck.
OK.
OK, well, why are you laying like that?
It is... her birthday.
Oh, my gosh! People keep blowing it out of proportion! It's not even a history.
I kind of forced you to do it.
Jim's bedroom.
Hey, how are you?
Absolutely, I do.
Hello.
Mmm, hmm.
[gasps] Did she see me?
Oh. Oh God.
Oh, um, well, you know, I��� I just��� I just think I would rather keep that private. You know, if you���d been filmed for nine years of your life, there���d be some things that you just wanna keep to yourself.
Jim's just really passionate about Italian food.
I'll make the call.
It's hot in there. How's the naan?
[whispering] Um, I���m sorry. I have to go. My daughter���s a ladybug. I know that doesn���t make any sense. Um, thank you, thank you.
Yay, Grandma!
I have one idea of what it means.
We said some. We said ���some.���
Took him 40 minutes to get ready.
You did what?
Who cares? [Michael peeking at them through his office window] It's not that huge a sale.
You're- You know your assistant told me that you have a big pitch meeting today. With Ryan Howard. How did that happen?
This is what you did last night?
Hey, Michael, why don't you just get down.
Happy birthday Michael.
Come on Angela, don't you have a game?
Yeah he does.
Maybe I'm overreacting.
So I'm going to Carbondale this afternoon to get a new bulk shredder.
I don't know any of those.
Do you guys want some food? The wings are really good here.
The first lesson of watching World Poker Tour at 2:00 AM, you play the opponent. Not the cards.
Probably.
Ohh, hey Gabe, I'm sorry, we... we didn't get you a cake or anything. We're gonna miss you.
It's good. But won't it feel weird cutting into a cross?
Definitely.
No. [laughs]
I missed you too. [Jim kisses her]
So how much antigravity potion do you want?
Hey!
Oh, don't worry about it. I mean, it's better than listening to Michael play a conch shell... which is what I was doing. Oh, also, Michael went to Jamaica with Jan!
Stop. Out with it.
Is this what I've become? Materialistic? Shallow? I feel horrible. [looks down at the check] oh look! 'Mrs. Pam Halpert!' That's the first time I've seen it in writing!
You get paid by the year at the bowling alley?
I'm the office administrator now, which means I'm basically being paid to be head of the party planning committee. The first thing I did as head... I shut it down. At its best it was a toxic political club used to make others feel miserable and left out. At its best it planned parties.
Hey Michael.
Oh my God, did you see 'The Apprentice' last night?
Oh, it's okay.
You finished the movie.
Oh, wow. Seriously? Oh my gosh, is that champagne?
I can't believe this is actually happening.
What?
We just had to add a few more tables. We weren't expecting this many people.
[on her cell phone] Hey where are you? Yeah, we were supposed to meet here. What? Oh my gosh! That ties in perfectly with something that Michael was telling me earlier! I just don't know what some of the people in, like, accounting are going to do? It said specifically that...
So place it on the infinity thing without being obvious, you know? I'd love to do like a color version just to bring a little color to the logo.
That is so cool.  Thanks Dwight!
Oh, yeah, we were. We were just looking to say hi. So hey.
Lunch with a girl from my hall.
Because I just wanted a relaxing evening at home...
Yeah, we don't want them at the wedding thinking Jim's being marched down the aisle by my dad with a shotgum.
[Jim rushes to open door for her] Thank you.
No, they have been dating for like two years. [Jim in shock] Since before your barbeque.
Oh my God!
White.
Hey.
Awesome! I'll leave it up here so everyone can enjoy it.
Jim, please.  Happy thoughts here.  Happy times.
In costumes!
She's not gonna say no.
Seriously?  Are you being serious?
Hey!
Hey, uh, any volunteers to come with me to go buy a Christmas tree?
Sometimes when we IM, I send you that little winking face with the lipstick.
Well we all wanted to plan your goodbye party. We thought this would be easier.
It's a miracle. She loves him.
Mm-hmm.
Oh no.
I love it, conservation.  Let's start by conserving our time and stop having these stupid meetings.   [stands up and cheers]  No more meetings!  No more meetings! No more meetings!  No more meetings!  [Stanley cheers her on in the background]
No, wait, come on.  I didn't miss a day, I came in early, I stayed late, and I doubled my sales last month.
I'm supposed to be Olive Oyl. And it makes more sense when I'm standing next to Popeye, but... Jim doesn't want to put his costume on.
Dwight.
Yeah, and the shoulder cutouts.
Last week, Michael sent out this mysterious memo.
I feel like [Pam look's out the window and camera pans out in The Office]--Dwight is holding a candle and reading a poem.
What?
I used a variation of your move.
Oh my God, you guys, look. It's Recyclops.
Phallus?
No.
I'm Pam Halpert.
I'm sorry. It's just, uhm, I actually do have this weird feeling that there���s something Jim isn't telling me.
She's coming in today and maybe just don't joke around about that stuff in front of her.
Roy has a connection. It's nicer than you think.
Great.
I'm sorry, we're throwing a party for someone because they're being horrible?
I don't, I don't think we sh-
Good. Doesn't sound pushy...you're just stating a fact.
The ones for drivers to check their blind spots?
I just wanted to get out of my room for a little while.
I dunno. I mean, maybe he'll talk to you about some of this stuff 'cause he can't really talk to me about it.
Sorry!
But that doesn't sound good.
[on phone] Michael, you're on with Jan.
You're good to talk to.
Yes, because she's hot, right?
No one said it has no calories.
[talking head with Jim] It's clear why we were trying not to tell people. That's clear now. [Jim nods, looking at floor]
Mema's not coming to the wedding. She's leaving tomorrow morning.
Okay.  Have fun with your girlfriend!
[to Jim] Good luck.
The unfair thing about working in sales is that your salary is almost all commission. So, you suck at sales, you make almost no money. I guess that's fair.
Jim does a really good one. Do yours.
Shut up, Hide! ��I mean, do you think Kevin cares what people think about him-- or Creed or Meredith? Oh my gosh, these are my role models now. You know what? I���m okay with that.
But then I moved it.
Hey!
[loudly] I need you to sign this! So bad!
Okay, that���s enough. [grabs phone]
Yes it's too tight.
There's a finger-painting station and a curly slide. Am I too old to go here?
Oh, I can not believe I fell for that. [laughing] Oh, my God.
No.
I get paid $40,000 per year.
Shh.
Called 'Impressions.'
Hey.
Yeah, right?
Yeah. No, no, I'll um-- the hundred. I'll just take the hundred.
That's great. [Meredith scowls]
And, poof! He disappears. [Jim snaps, playing along]
Yeah, what's that?
Maybe $50,000.
What was that?
How much stuff you got.
Wow, was it the age difference?
No.
Okay, I'm gonna head back.
If he comes out, distract him. [takes list to copier]
What?
I think I should hire them all. Do like Lollapalooza.
That's, um... I hadn't thought about it, huh.
[to camera, tearing up, smiling] I'm sorry, what was the question?
Aha. How���s Athlead?
Whoa!
Um, there was an amazing buffet and there was a chocolate fondue... station. And what else was there?
They're the same picture.
But sometimes he talks about flesh��� and bacchanals.
What? Look, no it was not...
Sales people can go later in the day. Hourly works can go at lunch.
Oh, Erin...
Look, I'm not the one who asked you to do a split when you've never done one before.
You're probably upset that I'm even at a Laundromat right now.  But, don't worry, I'm being safe.  And I'm headed home.  I'm... headed to my dorm.  Not home.
Yeah.
It's lovely.
My mother.
Can't stay there all day.
Oh, can I help? We could say someone is related to, uhm, Tonya Harding.
Don't do the twirl.
Well, if it makes you feel better, I didn't get one either.
[weepy] Yeah, I hate those endings.
Well, is that really a priority?
That's great.
Wow!
I���m good.
Uh, no, I um. Everything's pretty much the same here.
Michael...
There are a few people I decided not to invite, and that might make things kind of awkward but ...  it's my wedding. And I don't want anyone there who has called me a hussy.
Thank you.
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. [makes 'talking' gesture with her hand]  Jim, come on, we gotta get in there and practice.  Okay?  I'm not kidding!
Thank you. [goes to Michael's office and knocks on the door]
That sounds nice.
Okay, well I didn't think about it like that. It's just, I can't do anything about it. I can't replace that one unless that computer breaks.
Let's just calm down.
No Dwight, not the good peanut butter. People are going to get mad.
Roy gave it to me for Christmas.  I'm trying to figure out how to put songs on it.
Happy Birthday. [gives Meredith her card]
Yeah.
Yeah, I could tell.
Get up, get up.
Hello!
How would we know that?
Thanks.
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Sure, can I ask who's calling? Just a second.
Um, just cause, that, you work together, and it might be awkward.
Abercrombie & Fitch?
He left it at reception and we photocopied it.
Okay, see you later.
Michael, he means the Wall Street Journal online.
Forget everything we taught you.  Hey, Jan! It���s so great to see you.
I've really been putting in the hours on this mural. And my boss is totally OK with it, because he's in the Bahamas and has no clue what anybody is doing. I'm usually very self-critical. I hate what I paint. But, I don't know, this time I feel like it's, um, it's really coming together... [sees mural] Oh my god! [camera pans to mural with butts painted over it] Wha? You've gotta be kidding me! What it... are those... are those butts? [to warehouse crew] Huh? No way. No way!
Not really. It's kinda weird that a grown man is singing from the point of view of a little girl.
Hey, why don't you just go up to your office, get some work done, and I'll just bring you a pretzel.
I don't think so.
Uh oh. Someone started off on the right foot with the new boss!
Medium rare.  Thanks. [they laugh]
Really?
OK. What does he like? What's important to him? Does he have like a favorite pair of boots or a lunch box or...
I guess, yeah.
You guys, I don't think any of us are really qualified to be giving Holly personal advice about her love life.
Hey guys, what's going on?
Well, I don't wanna speak for Jim, but, it's like pretty official. [Jim smiles]
It's just last year you...
[turns around, is wearing a mustache] Bye, Stanley! Love you! [waves, Stanley leaves]
You just said that we're gonna be gone...?
Yeah, I guess, since I won.
I'm sorry to interrupt you. Um, I actually have something very important to talk to you about, business related.
[whispering] Angela, are you ready for the wedding?
Thanks mom.
I did it. I learned everything about this machine.  I know all the buttons, even the inside ones.   I know all the error messages.  I could do a bound book, in plastic with offset colors.  Which feels...
Well ���
Oh yeah.  Gotta get your REM cycle going with the whole sleeping.  Better than not.
I don't understand the question.
Oh in three months we can. Check the lease, and if you don't undo all the changes you've made, we're moving. Hey guys, can I show you some pictures.
That's fizzling. I mean, someone has to start the fizzle.
Oh... I'm pacing myself.
Look at the huge offices Jim, check out that conference room.
It's nice.
Yes. He was a good spy.
[nods and smiles]
Oh, Michael, thank you.  Thank you.
[looks at list] When did you add this to the list?
My veil tore.  I knew when we were getting married and I'm five months pregnant that I'm not going to be able to wear the dress that I always wanted or high heels--
Night, Creed.
Can you actually fire people?
Yeah. I was kinda hoping you could. I gotta go. Bye. [to Dwight] Come on. [camera pans to Clark duct taped to a chair]
Oh, call me later!
The guy has an algorithm to determine the winner of any given college basketball game.
No, I do.
Yeah.
Oh my God. It���s Jan.
Excuse me?
Hey!  Jim! Um, listen, can I call you back in a little bit?  I made friends!
Wow.
We can't let him buy our forgiveness with cupcakes. He was awful to us. And, he still is. How much is a cupcake? $2.50? Is that the price of our dignity?
And I have my original. [holds up original paper, ripped in half]
We have vodka!
No, it's fine.  I'm sure it must have been weird for Jim when Roy and I were joking around... that
Hey.
Oh, yeah. Right.
Oh wow, you weren't kidding.
I didn't see where it started but I saw where it ended.
Really you do. I love the material.
I can't. I'm really sorry if you misinterpreted things. It's probably my fault.
I know.
Yes. In my top three, so suck it.
I needed leverage so I pulled those pictures off the internet. It's just this Office Administrator thing, I don't wanna...
I know.
That's great.
I, I was gonna say, I think that um, we're gonna help Roy's cousin move.
Are you proposing!?
Okay let's go in. I'm freezing.
And we move to the south of France. See? No, there's plenty of bicycling for you. I think that's where they do the Tour de France.
Hey!
Uh, sure.
Hey, Mema.
I don't know if I'm gonna make any money with art.
Is this because Jim walked in on you going to the bathroom?
Okay, Okay. Um��� so��� this past year has been really great, and you���ve been great and I just��� I know that you had to make this choice and you had to give something up for me. But I never want you to have to give up anything. I just thought if I could get us an offer then there wouldn���t be anything standing in our way and I could come to you with this big Jim gesture��� and show you all at once just how much I love you and how much I really do believe in your future.
Yes. But there's, wait, oh, there's a funny ending to that story. I can't remember.
Hey!
I like that one.
[applauding] No way!
Yeah.
I actually might not go. Feeling kind of tired.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Thanks.
[loud sigh] Chicken.
No, I'm not going to do that.
Michael, that's fantastic.
Ok I think animals and proposals are out. Right Ryan didn't you read in one of your blogs that animals are out?
[Everyone���s phone vibrates] Oh, text from Kevin.
We can watch a movie and play Rock Band.
Michael.
Hmm. I think Jim���s lying to me about not being attracted to Cathy.
Okay-- just-- don't ever date a member of my family again.
There is a master key and a spare key for the office. Dwight has them both. When I asked, 'What if you die Dwight, how will we get into the office?' He said, 'If I'm dead, you guys have been dead for weeks.'
Oh!
I know.
Not relevant.
So Sarah Kaya says to Eric, 'No way.  You can't reserve seats.' And Stacy gets all up in her face and Sarah Kaya picks up Stacy's new PM pad and throws it at the light box.
Morning Michael!
Oh, yeah, because we were kind of dramatic in the beginning. Well I don���t think anything���s gonna change in our lives now. With work and two kids there���s just-nothing interesting is going to happen for us in a long, long time.
Hey, sorry. I'm ready.
Good.
And we'll make sure Dwight doesn't do anything C-R-A-Z-Y.
Yeah-- it's exciting.
Michael, I think that what Stanley did to you was rude.  Maybe you should just get him aside and tell him that he was behaving badly.
Ryan, just tell us your plan.
I have decided that I'm going to be more honest. I'm going to tell people what I want. Directly. So, look out world, cause ol' Pammy is getting what she wants. And, don't call me Pammy.
I should probably get back to...
I got this.
Stop. [giggling]
Did you prank Dwight?
I know that Jim has an amazing story about a relative of his who got caught up in the world of drugs.
Okay, I know I���ve been crying easily today, but- [shows unfolded paper Jim dropped, shows two lists, ���Pam��� and ���Cece��� on one side, ���Everything else��� on the other] I mean, that���s just pretty killer, right? I mean, maybe it���s stupid. No. [starts crying] It���s wonderful. I���m gonna frame it. I can always unframe it.
[on phone] So you know Stacy, right?
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.
Something's up with Jim and Karen.  Not that I've been eavesdropping.  It's not really any of my business, but I've gotten pretty good at reading the back of Jim's neck.
Jim! [hands him umbrella]
Bye. [Jim leaves]
Oh my god!
Before we kick off the party, I just want to remind everyone that an office party is just that...
Yup.
Oh! Gossip, who is it? Who is it? Who is it, Michael? ...Who?
You know, maybe there's an opportunity for a joke there, like, um... like, [vaudeville delivery] 'I just delivered a baby. They didn't offer me a guarantee.'
Okay. Um... here it is. Don't put your fingers in there. [shreds paper] Cool huh?
I'm inventing new diseases.
He sounds like a wounded animal.
It was just a little...
Maybe you should call back?
Well the breadsticks are like what then, Ryan, what can I use?
Really?
I literally cannot wait to see what Dwight has planned.  And I wish Jim were here.
Why aren't there any beans on this very old, frizzy-haired picture of me?
Ok, well, we're going to a bar. Hey. You have to come to stuff with me. I'm serious! If you're going to be my boyfriend, you have to do boyfriend things.
No.
When are you talking to David Wallace?
Uh, yeah. Just a fax.
Okay.
[to Jim] Yeah?
We���re fine. Yeah. [hugs both Darryl and Andy] And I���m sure that you guys are fine too. Because why wouldn���t you be?
Uh, buying lottery tickets online. [Ryan laughs]
Oh, God!
Mmhmm.
[sees trapeze contraption] What are you doing?
[Hunter's voice starts singing, Pam joins in] One night...
[sees Ryan on the horse] Oh, boo! Boo! Boo to you! Boo!
But it's not until next month.
Oh, okay. Everyone, remember, when he get's like this, he will wallow, if you empathize. Keep conversations light and if you get stuck, and you don't know what to do, make a random sound effect okay? Farting noise, whatever. Okay.
How am I supposed to... get...
Uh, just one second.  We're in a meeting and I'll see if he's available.  It's Jan.
I'm engaged. So...
And now you guys are dating?
Oscar, Kevin, this is my sister, Penny. She's also my maid of honor.
You do.
I'm setting Michael up with my land lady. She's really sweet and... whatever, I just can't take Michael like this.
Yeah, it was great because it was like you're supposed to be working, but nothing ever gets done.
Michael...
Yeah.
Well, you have to choose a food option and there's information in there about directions and lodging...
Guys, I'm proud of us. I think we did the right thing. [after noticing Angela easting cupcake] Hey!
I had just woken up. I didn't look cute. That's how I knew he meant it.
Switch the computers back Andy.
Prison Mike? What was the food like in prison?
Whoa, that's kind of condescending. Would you say something like that to Jim?
And also there is no such thing as a rabies doctor.
No, I didn't mention that you cooked your foot.
Yeah.
Erin, it's not up to you. This computer was for reception! Okay? It's not yours to give away.
Tomorrow I start a three-month design program at the Pratt Institute in New York. I will be a little fish in the big apple. [does hand gesture] What up, 212?
Hey, put me down. Put me down. [Meredith turns and looks at Jim and Pam] Oh my god, hey, put me down. Hey...
No, I want you to say that you think the 'best' person to be our new manager is a homeless person.
Trip Advsior.
I have an early lunch.
Why did that come into your brain?
You talked to the man whose wife you're having an affair with.
Hey.
So we just... we wanna help you plan the proposal so that it's safe and responsible and realistic and doable.
At this point, when you're this pregnant, it's kind of like senior spring. The other day I spit my gum out on the carpet.
Honey, no.
Mmm.  Mmm-mmm. [shakes head 'no']
Why are you wearing a hat now?
[gets up and walks over to Angela, whispering to her] Hey. Thanks for ratting me out!
It's with Brian and Alyssa.
Oh... um... no.  That's... um... That's actually fine
You need to be more upset about this. She's your mother too now. Your mother is sleeping with Michael Scott.
I'm looking forward to 'Take Your Daughter to Work' day. I am not great with kids, but I wanna get better. Because I'm getting married. So, I put out a bunch of extra candy out on my desk so the kids will come talk to me. ...Like the witch in Hanzel and Gretel.
Erin, you don���t need to call him that.
What?! No! I-I got this. [Laughs] Okay?
He does.
Um, hi. How are you?
Good.
Is there more wine in the kitchen?
Yeah, wasn't that neat?
[Reading Jim's palm] You're major and minor lines cross at a ridge - that sucks.
Yeah, I'm glad you said something.
[to Jim] Hey! You can just give her your extension.
It's better, thanks.
[runs over after walking over fire coals] Hey! I want to say something. I've been trying to be more honest lately and I just need to say a few things. I did the coal walk! Just, I did it! Michael, you couldn't even do that.  Maybe I should be your boss? Wow, I feel really good right now.  Why didn't any of you come to my art show? I invited all of you.  That really sucked. It's like sometimes some of you act like I don't even exist.  [turns and looks directly at Jim] Jim, I called off my wedding because of you. And now we're not even friends.  And things are just like weird between us, and that sucks. And I miss you. You were my best friend before you went to Stamford, and I really miss you. I shouldn't have been with Roy. And there were a lot of reasons to call off my wedding. But the truth is, I didn't care about any of those reasons until I met you.  And now you're with someone else. And that's... fine. It's... whatever. That's not what... I'm not... Okay, my feet really hurt. The thing that I'm just trying to say to you, Jim... and to everyone else in this circle I guess, is that I miss having fun with you. Just you, not everyone in the circle. Okay, I am going to go walk in the water now. Yeah. It's a good day.
Okay, when you���re selling to women, it is crucial that you listen, Dwight. Also you want to respect their... Are you listening now?
I'll leave a message.
That's a sad story. I have another one. We move, the other tenants follow, the bank takes the building, takes your farm, takes your car and beats the crap out of you. Penniless, you die, and my daughter Cece dances on your grave... fully clothed. [lights turn off, Pam and Dwight begin to wave their arms to alert the sensor]
[Laughing, covering her mouth]
I'm working on it Kev.
Yeah? [stops laughing] It was though, that's what happened.
I wished, right?
Hi. [they kiss] Mmm. 'Cause-- [looks toward camera]
Okay, we're watching, Mose!
Hey, Karen. Sorry about that meeting today, that was really crazy.
Right.
Say they don���t hire you. It���s not like you���re out on the street. You have a great job with people who love you.
That's not accurate.
Why would you want to raise your cholesterol?
Well.. um I, I don't...
Great! I thought you could use this time to authorize some checks.
Or not adopt.
It's Christmas.
Some of us like the walk more than others.
Oh, Michael.
Oh, good.
Kay.
I love these.
Yes, you have very nice teeth.
No, keep it up.
Got it. I will put out a A.P.B. Otherwise known as a 'Ask Pam Beasley'. ... Did the phone cut off?
Hey Ryan.
No. No no no! [nos coming from all employees]
Okay.
Did you see him at a bathhouse?
Maybe you could play a song on your recorder.
You can try mine.
[answers phone] Hey Toby.
She's right, it works. I would imagine.
[laughs]
You probably won't.
Hey, there's a...
Shh! Kids are dancing.
So when do I get to hear everything? Are you still getting unpacked or... you want to grab a coffee or something after work?
Kevin!
I'm having contractions, but they're irregular and far apart.  So I'm not really in labor, I'm near labor.
Hey, what happened? What did Ryan want?
I could read it.
Sorry. What do I want? What do I want... Oh, it's a pencil cup.
If you propose to me during a Michael meeting, I will say no.
Yeah.
She's sweet and cute. I thought you'd get along.
That's it.
[breathes deeply and runs across coals] Oooh, uh hah, ooh! Wha-hoo! Ahhhh...
Ah, yeah. We haven't told anybody, but it's going really great. [looks at Jim] Right?
Oh! I'm going into labor! Oh my goodness!
[pours something from the fridge into a bowl and opens the microwave, it is covered in exploded food] Oh, come on! [to the documentary crew] Do you see this?  Disgusting.
Ok.
Oh, no, no, no.
Oh no, don't, don't, don't, don't. [Michael laughs] Aah! [laughs, then leaves] Okay...
What flavors did you get? [yawns]
What are you doing?
Yes!
Oh, no. Your battery fell out.
Oh, good.
I'm not... I'm not going to have...
Don't we all?
Yeah, Bob Vance took her for a walk to calm down.
Man, Angela really had a hold on him. [Dwight playing the recorder in the background]  Angela.
Mmm! Good pate, right? [Matt nods yes] Oscar made it. Have you met Oscar?
[at school in NYC] Can't believe this. [pulls out cell phone... sighs]
Well, looks like he really did just want to talk about the issues. i'm Sorry Oscar.
You want some help?
Yeah. Listen, have a nice weekend.
[through phone] It's been so long since I've been with adults. I am so excited to see everybody. Creed, Ryan. Oh my God, Stanley! Stanley's going to be there. Yes, oh my God!
Come on Andy! I mean you said you wanted a new computer and this is the best I could do!
Cool, are you coming back to say hi?
Yeah?
[on phone] Yes, I understand.  Can I transfer you to customer relations?
Oh, Michael...
Life is Downton Abbey.
But I've learned to love again. [puts her arm on Jim's shoulder] He's a cartoon sailor.
Thank you.
Did you just mark on that?
Dwight is about to get so Pammed.
It's funny you bring that up because yes it is.
Michael, he made huge cuts.
Unbelievable!
Hey Dad. No I know, Mom told me. Ok. Yeah I'll see ya then.
Step away.
I did. And it's just one of those things that's going to keep gnawing at me, like 'gnaw, gnaw, why? Why didn't he? I have no idea why.'
It says here you cater to the eldery.
Oh, yeah! We have such a solid foundation, you know.
Yeah. I feel better.
No the paper's not toxic.
I wish we'd started this exercise six months ago. My heart just feels so... blocked up.
Can you give us another minute please?
Yeah, I'm okay.
Really unlikely. But I can't say that it's impossible.
Yes. Or come in.
Good morning, Erin.
It's disgusting!
I don't know.
No, thanks. I had some already.
Who's that?
Ok. I, just, when you are done or any time it's convent, I just thought since you are out...
No, Michael.
Well, are you dating anyone?
Okay, well, I just sorta meant, like, cute, right?
And I've always believed that we should all be involved in everyone's personal lives, in a very major way.
Well, you know... actually, I kind of need to stall a bit. But, it's okay, because I am very used to killing time.
That could really be fun.
[sighs] Nevermind.
How about Darryl?
[enters with the kids] Family picture!
Okay.
Oh, Dwight. I'm so sorry. Were you guys close?
Dwight's health care memo. I told you about it.
And uh, I'll look into those.
Wait, wait.  My iPod's not in here!
Can I help you, Michael?
No, Michael.
Hon, I wish you would have told me an hour ago, when you knew you weren���t gonna make it.
Boo!
Good morning, Michael.
[smiles]
New York or Philadelphia.
Well Darryl, no kid wants to buy their own Christmas presents.
[surprised] Okay.
I am working.
Oh, Michael.
[extricating herself] Okay.
You just have to go in there. You have to hear it from her.
Can I talk to you a second?
Great.
Nobody's going to prison, okay? Um... all right, Michael, you need to convince Jo to go easy on us. And then we'll all confess once we know our jobs are safe.
I like working here.
Oh, my God.
The two people with the lowest sales in the quarter have to do them.
Oh my God. Is that Jan? [points to same monitor]
Hey, Erin, it's Pam. How ya doing? No, no, don't put Cece on the phone, because she can't talk yet. Okay. No, I was just calling to see how everything's going. Yeah? Yeah? It's good? The play? The play is kind of great. I mean, it's fun to hear Andy sing in the appropriate setting. Now, he's really sorry you couldn't make it, too. Yeah. So thank you so much, again. We're having a great time. Oh, they're flashing the lights so we should go in. Thanks. Bye. Okay, so we called. And everything's fine!
Ta-da!
Yes. Yes, it's possible.
Um... I think it's really, really unlikely.
Okay. I'd never heard that before. So, thank you.
Nothing happened. We went on a couple of dates. He never called me again.
[to Cece] Hm. Don't listen to her. She's just jealous 'cause she doesn't get to come home to someone as cute as you.
All right. I did not come back here just to see you.
On the drums! On the drums!
Hey Kev, guess what. I won an art contest today.
[over the phone] I just talked to my advisor. Failing.
Angela, you're the chairman of the party planning committee. I shouldn't even be planning this, it's your job.
Just let me have... Oh.
[in New York, humming to herself to the tune of 'Centerfold'] Na na na na na. Na na na na na na na.
I know.  Isn't that always how it goes?
Doesn't Jan have money?
Michael! It's really good to see you.
When are you leaving?
I don't know, I didn't read it carefully, I just saw 'congratulations' and I skimmed the list, I saw my name, I came in here to tell you and get a snack.
Hey! We need to get you dressed!
Hey.
Do you want us to count to three?
Phyllis has gotten into audio books and lately she's been listening to 50 Shades of Grey.  Which, if you don't know what it is, it's a book about um...
[to Jim] Go up and check on him. He's upset.
Shoot.
Wait, when did we start calling it that-
Yeah.
Hello everyone. We would just like to announce that our party is starting now in the break room. So... you can come by... .
Okay, now I'm laughing at you.
Okay. Okay. Yeah.
Um, I'm not bothering you, am I?
Yeah.
Me too.  ...I think we're just drunk.
Yeah, maybe.
Ok, you've got to pull it together.
Wow.
Wait. What?
For the record? Not on board with fake Stanley... although, I get it.
[Laughs] I have good cards.
I'm bored.
Oh my god! Ah!
Mm. Hey. Oh, hi, Gabe.
A world where you truly can be anything you want.
We got you this. [gives a bottle of wine]
Thank you, bye-bye.
Thank you! Thank you. I got it. Now I know. You thought I was a little dorky. You know? [gibberish sounds] Okay. Well, excuuuuse me.
So, can I..? [points to the door]
Really?
Okay fine. Ryan, something the matter?
Or I could come back as your personal assistant. You know? Sort your mail, set your appointments. I know all the people.
I would love to meet Long Tim.
I don't know.
That's right, you did.
No.
Uh, yeah, the one...
Umm, I put stickers so you know where to sign.
Love you.
You can do that?
Bye Jim.
Swaying isn't dancing.
Dwight, here, let me help you Dwight.
OK.
You shouldn't be fired. I mean, you were just protecting me.
An idea bigger than the Grand Canyon?
You want to play pool?
Wow.
Thanks Toby.
What have you done?
He's a big Meryl Streep fan, so I shouldn't be surprised that he's identified with her character.
Hey, Dwight, um, my friend is kinda into these two girls that he works with.
I should really get going.
I went out to look for a better office space.
OK. [to Darryl] Do you know the plate... never mind. Why would you know that? And why would I be asking that?
I know. It's just even if it was, a great boss and a great job, I just, I don't know, I don't know if I want, um, I don't know if I want this.
No, I was um...
No, I will not.
No, I got the teacher introducing them and then the applause afterwards. But not so much of the middle part.
We can do this.
Hmm.
I can't hear anything!
20 past 5.
Have three stages, yeah.
[walks up] Honey.
I'm thinking cow-
Hey.
Uhm.
Yeah, I gave him a ride home because...
Oh no you ain't!
But I don't think I am.
[to Michael] Oh, would that make you feel better?
Yes. Yes, I desperately want to speak with you about my sex life with Jim.
You have a gun in your desk?
I don't know, I think I was just staring at my desk.
Well, it doesn���t spin. We���ll just move the wheel one notch each morning and��� you see what chore you get that day.
Never underestimate the power of a good night's sleep.
Nothing new.
You were so dorky!
Good morning, can I help you?
Mm. Excuse me. Could I get some more water?
[mimicing Katy] Oh definitely, definitely step in and out of it like that.
Hey, how���d it go?
We'll find another receptionist. I mean, that's easy. We'll be fine. [Andy nods reluctantly]
He looks a lot like you. How much time did you spend on that?
Wow.
Well I think they'll get the spirit of it.
Oh my god!
You don't have to do that, Kevin.
What kind of stuff does Stanley say?
What does that mean?
You waited for me?
What does that even mean? Where would your name appear?
Awwh, you're welcome. [they hug] My pleasure.
Ohhh.
Then we can go to dinner.
[in disbelief] You called Stanley's wife?
Well, you know.
Nice.
Huh. What about Cathy?
Because everything makes me cry, so what���s the difference? This dog, he just wants to protect his bone.
Oh, uh, entire bottle. At least.
[giggles]
Yeah. Way too much.
Where���s Angela? [Hands paper over her shoulder]
Hello! This is... the client.
No, I mean he's sulking. That's not like him.
So, maybe just try one at first, and then if it's okay, have a couple more...
It's an epidemic.
Yeah, but I mean, look at the salary. And it's definitely a step up. And a challenge.
How was Jamaica?
You���ve got this Schrute.
Yeah.
A dozen different pies? Cause that means rhubarb.
Tell me before I come there.
[on phone] No, he hasn't picked one yet.
Yep. Lucked out.
Hold on a second. [turning] Wait, what did you just say?
Oh yeah?
Dreams are just that. They're dreams. They help get you through the day. Like the thing about the terrace. It's nice but... um... I don't know. It was just something I read in this book when I was twelve. The girl in the book has a terrace outside of her bedroom and she planted flowers on it and I just loved that. Just always kind of stuck with me.
Yes, I know, but it's gonna be different.
Okay, please hurry.
Not one of them called to congratulate me on our engagement.
[laughs] 10 years ago.
Do you think that they're like-
Okay.
You know, stuff people didn't intend for everyone to see. And they kinda want to know how much.
What? No! No, I just had this brilliant idea- everyone loved it. You don't have a copyright on pranks. I might be better at this than you.
Hmm-mm.
Oh my god! It's really you!
Well... no, I don't... exactly... what?
Wow.
I don't know, but it's interesting right?
Yeah, no, he asked for you specifically. He's in the conference room.
Are you being serious?
Jim, what if we both lose our jobs?  I'm trying to think of a way that this all ends up fine, and I can't think of one.
What?
Hey, Erin. Do you mind faxing this for me?
Hey, Michael.
Okay.
Oh my goodness, you sound sexy.
Perfect boobs, [gives a look at the camera] of course I remember Holly.
I know.  If she wasn't an alcoholic before, she is now. [Jim laughs]
No, come back! No, no, no!
[touches ear] Jim? Jim?
A little bit.
Oh, great. Thank you.
Okay, well it's just really loud.
Yeah, we should do that for real sometime.
Tell them what happened last year.
No, Sarah Kaya comes in.  Don't interrupt, I have like thirty seconds to finish this and get to DigiPres.
Oh... is it...
Alright, just call me after the doctor.
Haha!  Ha ha ha.
[laughs]
Oh! So close to retirement.
[crying]
Eight? Really?
Uh, not on a three month boat trip.
There he is!
Oh.  Okay.
[Michael comes out with Vikram, arms raised] We got Vikram!
Well in your fantasy we're Stephen King characters.
Because, she didn't send it to you!
No, we um, we had plans for a third, but then I don't know, you never called me back, so...
Phyllis! What are you talking- The whole card depends on this!
Andy, why should she have your crappy computer?
[laughing] Oh-ho-ho! He talked about himself in the third person?
No! How? I'm so clean!
Yes! [they embrace and kiss]
Yes. Never found that bottom, did we?
Yes.
So when are we going out?
Would I make that up?
I am. You should come dance with us.
Creed. I noticed you don't have a resolution on the board. What's yours?
You headed out?
Coming to Scranton. Is anyone coming to Scranton?
Yea. Yea no problem. [runs away]
[People playing casino games as the actual Casino Night begins] Oh, my God!
Hey.
[goes to punch Michael; he flinches] You have to keep your hands down, Michael.
[enters the office and has another contraction]  Oh, whoa.  Ha.  Wow.
I asked Tom and Pete to come early so we could play a prank on Jim at lunch! Pretty awesome, right? I think they're into the idea. They're probably thinking, 'That Pam Beasly, she's the coolest sister-in-law on the planet. She's the best! The absolute best.'
Do you mind?
Senator Lipton helped me submit my design for a new mural on a building downtown. Now I���m just waiting to hear from the selection committee. But, you know, let���s be realistic. There are a ton of great artists in Scranton with way more experience. I mean, who are they gonna go with -- some nobody like me or a big name like Tracy Fleeb?
I don't want to look at your friend Jasmine's boobs all day.
Oh, don't get us wrong, we like picnics.
After you talked, he called my mom and said he was gonna look for an apartment.
Then who do you think will get the job?
Yesterday, they delivered the new one. But they didn't set it up. So my day just got a little more interesting. [holds up a huge manual]
Maybe. I mean...
[laughing] Gross. I love it.
Why won't you just admit that she's attractive? It's kind of annoying that you won't say it.
Michael, you're just her rebound!
[at her desk, grabs her plant and sees it dried up, looks at Jim] Oh. You couldn't have watered it?
What?
Michael's still at the door.
I think he's just making her laugh.
Hey, Meredith I need to tell you something.
[to Jim, quietly] Food!
I told you, I have the number that rings here. Do you want that number?
It's nice. It's funny. It mentions his tonsillectomy and makes a funny little joke about his moustache.
[taking Michael's picture] Okay, a little bit more closer to the sign. Yeah.
What could he possibly stand to gain from a real juggling routine?  How can you keep defending him?
Ryan invited some of the branch managers and Toby into the woods for a 'get to know you' weekend. Michael wasn't invited. Apparently they already knew everything they needed to know about him.
This is where I used to keep my computer.
Absolutely! [starts out]
I'd like to try it.
We're the party planning committee, and we did not get where we are by playing it safe. We got here by being risk takers. And, yeah, Dwight's party is gonna be terrible. Maybe. Maybe it's not. Maybe it's going to be great. And if it's great...I think we all know what that would mean to us.
You're gonna make another 'spreadsheet.'
Sorry.
Well, you shouldn���t be nervous about this. This is a tiny start-up with a bunch of guys just as dorky as Jim.
So um-
Dwight!
Oh...
You hit her?
Yes, but they are both in danger.
Well, what about the other stuff that has to be in today?
Some people.
Oh.
[as Jim receives and declines a call] Who���s that?
Give it back to me now.
Oh! I... uh... yeah. Um... I'll uh show them to you later.
Watson carpet and tile.
[Jim comes out of the office]  What's the news?
What are they doing?
Oh me too.
[reads memo] 'Sleeves down to the wrists, buttoned-up collars, and muted colors.' Nobody dress like that. [camera pans over to Angela]
Hello, Mr. Schrute, nice to see you. Please have a seat.
You look good.
I know that I shouldn't have done it. But I was in the parking lot at the Quick and Easy.
No, it's the pacifier's turn.
Mmmmm, yes!
Oh. You've changed so much.
Yeah, but in a jokey way where you're gonna start singing.
Uh huh.
Well, I kind of liked Legal...
No.
Helen Mirren. Hot?
No. Thanks... uh we're still having lunch today, right?
Go get your laptop.
Really, Dwight? How fast are you?
Don't take her side.
Absolutely. [dials and hands Jim receiver]
Oh, I don't know if I'm...
I could give you some beginner stickies?
Are you sure you don't want to play?
1-8-5-0-5.
Yeah, right.
I am just following the website.
[chuckling]
It's just good to stop a Michael train of thought early before it derails and destroys the entire town.
Hi, can I help you?
You have to go?
Yeah. [they hug]
Okay.
What about before? Was I attractive before?
Ohh... [they hug; she laughs]
Hey.  I'm not going to get in the car, because I know if I do you'll try to drive me to the hospital.
Bye.
Yeah, OK then.
Okay.  So... you would be the Regional Manager,
If you're using more than three pieces of tape to wrap a present, you're doing it wrong.
Uh, yeah.
Just because someone likes things clean, doesn't mean they're rich.
I got it.
Yeah, totally. So...
Will you just, will you grab Clark real quick?
Um, Karen left her blindfold on the longest but she also threw her egg at Jim.
Seventy-six percent. What's yours?
It's like mommy and daddy are fighting. Except mommy outranks daddy and mommy is way scarier.
Oh. [sends fax, Erin nods] Are you...
Okay, well she takes her convictions pretty seriously, she can be kind of severe.
He's a gun nut.
Oh, yeah, no! You know. Whenever.
New York or Philadelphia.
Michael!
Oh.
Yeah. 'I vant to count to ten'.
Mm-hmm.
.... Corner idea?
Um, it's kind of private.
Ooh, Toby!
Ok. She's ok?
Do you want me to ask where you're going?
Then why'd you even offer!?
I went on a date. It wasn't a love connection, um... I think when I like someone again, I'll just kinda know.
I wish that you'd stop rubbing that lamp in that creepy way.
Anyway, we also have a special on envelopes.
Oh, great! [to Dwight] His truck!
Kevin, at most you���re saving a microscopic amount of time.
Michael... you shouldn't be with someone who doesn't make you happy.
How much?
[eating] These are gross.
So how do you come up with your cartoons?
So, Melissa... I met your mom a couple times. She's
[as others eat] Wait!
And we need bodies in both these rooms, people. So please sign up.
You've gotta be kidding me.
Mmm-hmm
That's a really... well fine,  Do the German instructions say what this is supposed to do?
Michael.
Michael, I have Jan on the line.
[shocked after seeing the torn up carpet] Hey��� What happened here?
Oh.
Johnny Depp. [everyone looks confused toward Toby]
Well you seem a little tired.
I don't think it would be the worst thing if they let me go because then I might... I don't think it's many little girls' dream to be a receptionist. I like to do illustrations. Um... Mostly watercolor. A few oil pencil. Um, Jim thinks they're good.
Find someone else, I don���t know. Ask Phyllis.
Yeah I did a watercolor of Frances Willard Elementary School for a contest they were having. They were calling with the results. And I won. I won! My painting won. So I like to thank my mom for always encouraging me. And I like to thank my dad for buying me my first set of art pencils. And I'd like to thank the sixth grade class that picked me.
Okay.
Kinda sounds like... prison's... better than Dunder-Mifflin.
Yeah, we call it White Elephant.
Sell.
Tell us what you're talking about.
Hey, I was talking to Cathy. Turns out she is single.
Sure. Anything else?
[mouths 'I'm sorry' to Oscar]
Oh, my God, [eating a bar in the hallway] I thought I was gonna pass out.  [Jim takes it from her and takes a bite]
You know what, I think we should get some other input.
Oh, yeah, sorry.
Or in a great chair.
What's going on? Do you know that guy?
Well, I appreciate that some opportunities can be unpleasant- [Jim's phone rings, he answers]
Me too...
Good, how are you? Busy?
Sometimes when he's not here, I try to throw stuff in it.
Sorry we're late.
Mm-hmm.
I'm sorry, he's not usually like that.
He'll call you back. OK, great.
You're in the gay mafia.
So when are you due?
Yes, and then we decided that was crazy.
Michael?
Oh, hey, Molly. You should just quit.
Pan?
[To camera] I don't care what they say, I just want to eat. Which I realize is a lot to ask for... at a dinner party.
Hey, don't you have a daughter?
Thank God you were there.
Oh- [both look at each other and together say] Thank you.
No.
Well, actually, rhubarb is-
[singing] Just smile for me and let the day begin.  You are the sunshine that lights my heart within... on the wings of love ...
I gotcha one. [Pam hands over a grape soda to Jim]
I can't get a fire pit. I have two babies.
Oh, um, it's just, I didn't, I didn't have a lot of time, so that's just a place holder.
Didn't Ben Franklin have syphilis?
[on phone] Cici has been calling me 'Pamela'. Like four times this week.
Robert doesn't talk like that. You have to stop Dwight from doing this.
Say that I'm lying or say that I have the job. Make a definitive statement, Gabe.
Why not?
Sure.
Admit what?
And he wants to take the WaveRunners to the lake this Saturday so...
Yeah... That was um...
Win!
Freedom fries. Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
You know what, Dwight? Let me just check the bathroom first. Okay?
Okay, weirdo.  Come on.  It's time for cake.
Jim.
What are you doing out here?
Oh, oh OK.
Hey, Dwight. Jim and I found your wallet in the parking lot.
You have to tell them.
Cupcake. It's cupcakes and strippers all the way down.
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.
Ok, that's uh, good news [Pam sees Angela eavesdropping] Uh, yeah, no I'll let you go.
Okay. Okay. Yes.
We invited everyone in the office to our wedding.  Even though we realized most people wouldn't be able to make the drive to Niagara Falls.  [whispers] Which is why we're having it in Niagara Falls.  [normal volume] Then Michael told everyone they could have Friday and Monday  off, if they came.  So now, people have to decide if they want to come to our wedding or have to work.
You want me to write down people's indefinable qualities?
Oh, cause it was upside down. [both laugh]
Salesman.
Yeah.
Michael told us to wait in here. We don't know why.
You're being gross.
[in the car] We still surprise each other.
There's nothing better than a beautiful day at the beach, filled with sun, surf, and uh... diligent note-taking. [holds up notes]
Ok. [intense moment where Jim leaves and Pam seems conflicted.  She notices his umbrella and runs out to follow him]
And looks so handsome in his UNIFORM! Please?
Michael, I think that as the boss you should really---
How do you figure?
Have you?
No football games, recitals, karate tournaments.
Maybe.
You got a second?
This could all go away if you just tell me the truth.
Back off, Dwight. [serves] Hyuh! [the opposing team misses the ball, the Scranton team cheers] What?
You've seen things cleaned before though, right?
We're together.
Hey, sorry, I really didn't want to come in. It's just that we have to go buy a new Christmas tree, and we're hoping we could borrow your truck.
That sounds nice.
How far away does she live now, like ten minutes?
Who is it?
Sure.
Yeah, know what?
There's some filing, restocking the supply shelves. Replacing the water jug, which nobody likes to do. Um, we... uh, eat a lot of cake!
It might seem crazy, but since there's no one left in New York, Michael is Dunder Mifflin's highest ranking employee. So, that's where we are.
No.
Aw! That's great Toby.
How'd the run go?
Have you seen her with her bangs?
Yeah, I know.
Great. Everything's great. Hey are you nervous about your big meeting?
Roy was supposed to pick the band, but he's concentrating more on the bachelor party now.
That's weird, my breast pump is missing. Have you seen my breast pump?
I'm really happy to be back with Roy. I think it shows maturity. Maturity and dignity. ... Is that braggy? I don't mean it to be braggy.
Jim, we waited too long!
Thanks!
Oh! [Jim reenters bus through hatch] Hey! How'd it go?
Okay.
You're gonna throw my things on the ground?
What? Come on guys. We need to figure out who did this and punish them. This isn't just about me. This is about all of us. This is our mural. Don't you see? How much we worked on this? How much time and energy? We put our heart and soul into this thing.
What? Why?
[on phone to Jim] There���s nothing down here.
I don't know. They're still in there.
Oh, hey, guys! I'd like to introduce you to a new little friend of mine.  His name is New Year's resolution board.
Great.
What?
So, detour. We're now adding Nashua to the Lecture Circuit so Michael can confront Holly and get some closure. Nashua actually sounded very excited on the phone. I don't think they get a lot of visitors. Because their office is only accessible by cross-country skis. Hey-oh! [laughs] [whispers] I've been driving too long.
Fine! [eggs splatter all over his robe] Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Kevin, don't! Come on!
Okay.
Nothing.
Oh. [smiling]
Okay, heart-shaped jewelry is not something that a woman buys for herself. A man definitely bought it for her recently, and it wasn't Michael.
I don't know I'm really committed to winning.
Yeah.
You could start by concluding this meeting.
Michael? This is the press release I was telling you about.  Ryan wants you to share it with everyone.
I made brownies.
I have so many people to thank for this award.
You were supposed to be the Lookout.
How about, Angela can keep it up on Tuesdays and Thursdays?
You're not stuck.
Oh, it's Creed's birthday today.  Should we get him an ice-cream cake?  Mint chocolate chip?
You won't be disappointed.
You know, I bet Ryan thinks to himself 'I wish I were a volunteer sheriff on the weekends'.
You know, like aren't some things just so nice and cozy in the rain?
it���s okay. You can sit in the annex.
You made a 'P.'
What do you mean?
Yeah.
Okay.
Hmm.
Bye.
It is not that. Kevin! Oh!
Mike Tibbets, really?
I'm sorry too.  I just, I think that we both made some bad choices.
Ok. Bye Harvey.
Michael, you did all this?
[giggles]
This is weird with you facing the other way.
Ok, drama.
Hey. I think it looks great.
Thank you.
You know what?  I really think the whole thing is just gonna blow over in like a week or two.
What's going on, why do you have a second job?
Thank you.
Well a giant check costs about $200.00 to make up. I have a print shop standing by but... What do you think Michael, that's over 25% of our funds?
We don't have any money. We don't have an office. We don't have anything.
It's Alex.
Good!
I don't know!  Let's go by the house and get it.  It's only twenty minutes past the hospital!
Yeah, I wanted to show you something in the lobby. Come on.
It's Phyllis!
Roy and I are saving for the wedding, so I made him promise not to get me anything too big.
Thin handsome, Michael.
Hey, is this Dwight?
You called the meeting I don't..
OK.
Okay.  Aw, thank you.
And we know how he died.  Flying into the glass doors.  But you know what?  I don't think he was being stupid.  I think he just really, really wanted to come inside our building to spread his cheer and lift our spirits with a song.
Thanks, Brian.
Well, I didn't think that butt was funny.
Zero.
No, thank you.
It's like squishing a spider under a book.  It's gonna be really gross but I have to look and make sure that it's really dead.  Sooo... [to camera guys] If you guys see anything... ?
Yeah, go away. [Kelly nodding]
In case I get sick.
Wait, are you saying that into the phone or are you saying that to me.
What?
Yep, that, yeah.
Yeah.
No, Michael's right.  Jobs are safer.
Tell me one thing about you I don't know.
Pregnant, no.
I don���t think I should.
Oh, wow!
Actually Andy, I think maybe we experienced it.
No, no, no, 'Tracks of My Tears' and what else? What are some more? What's one more?
Okay.
No one's calling.
You have to get rid of all your weapons. All of them. Including killer fish.
[looking with Kevin at the art show flyer] Should be fun.
Hey honey, it's me. Just trying to catch you before going home. Um, oh, well just give me a call whenever. Hope your day got better. Love you.
Hey.
Bottle of rum it is. [takes package out of bag] Alright, shall we?
You know, when Holly gets back, everyone will tell her what a great job you did. And then she'll realize what she's missing.
No no, you can go home. I'm good.
OK.
Yeah, I changed them to your new address.
[studying mural wall] I guess if I make a mistake, I can just paint over it with a shrub or something. It���s just, I think less of paintings with a lot of shrubs. So, I���m gonna limit myself to one shrub.
Who is that?
I'm still having a nice day.
Kelly really likes to online shop.  Soooo, I felt like I wanted some new clothes.  I mean, I just, I wanted to, it just, I felt like it was time, to maybe um... just get new clothes.
David, what are you doing here?
OK.
[going up to give Dwight a hug] Thanks for much for helping the company, Dwight.
And, I feel God in this Chili's tonight. WHOOOOOOOO!!!!
When Jim decided to come back to Scranton full-time, I was relieved, but I also feel a little guilty. I mean, he���s giving up this big thing for me. But he seems happy. I mean, he���s certainly been goofing around a lot. I love goofy Jim.
Good to meet you.
Okay, alright, thanks...  Okay, do you want to eat?  You want to try eating?  Okay...  Okay, let me...  Just you and me.  Come on.  There we go...  Yeah...  Oh, yeah.  Like that.  There we go.  You got it.
Matt?
Hey, well, good morning.  I think I have good news for you today.  I found your new executive assistant.  My friend Carla.  [looking at resume]  She's got great experience.  We even considered making her Cece's godmother, but she had this boyfriend at the time-- but here's her resume.
Yeah, but this is different.
Yes. But John Stamos was temporary. I quickly moved on to-
Stop eating it! Do you wanna be happy? Look at you. You have a major self-destructive streak in you.
But...
Hey.
Oh, I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
You did?
Oh���gee���I���m���
Sometimes your laziness borders on incompetence.
Do you have something in your pocket?
[nods head yes]
I got it.
Nashua got mp3 players.
He means his mopey place, it's under that streetlamp that he thinks was in Casablanca.
Oh my God.
Breakfast Club. Um... The Princess Bride and...
Okay, first, work out. And, hey! Look! You did that. Check. [Michael doing leg lifts] Eat an enormous breakfast. Check.
For real, you're not kidding?
[on phone] Hey, Jim. It's Pam.
Look, seriously, I can move it fine. Come on, let's go, it's our ball. Let's go!
This.
The thing about pregnancy is people treat you differently. Like you're a kid almost. They lose all sense of boundaries. They start acting weird, telling you things that clearly aren't true. I know it sounds nuts, but I think Dwight is the only one who's telling me the truth.
What? Erin is that true?
Oscar, no. This is not the time for one of your principled stands.
Phyllis there's a package for you.
You know what? I'm gonna get a hose. Then we'll talk about it. Ok we'll figure it out. Be right back. Just stay there.
Tell 'em how it happened.
[whispering] Hello? Yes, this is Pam Halpert. I got the mural? [Loudly] Oh, my God!
Dwight, are you carrying a gun?
What? Really?
Ha ha. That���d be great. Kind of like ditching school, except instead of getting suspended, you get��� What do you get? Oh my god! Why didn���t I think of this? Andy���s not here. Oh, hey, Erin, um, I���m expecting a shipment of pens. Can you cover that?
It was a ghost, I told you this on, like, our first date.
Oh, hey, Jim. Wait, stop. Um, I'm sorry... for pushing you towards Cumberland. Seriously, if you left here, I would blow my brains out.
Is it a good message or a bad message?
Fail. I don't want to fail... again.
No, that was a long time ago.
Yeah, you don't grab these [gestures to her chest] for balance.
Say it. Where?
Uh, Phyllis got a good look.
Huh.
Whoo-hoo���go, Meredith���s stripper son.
Well, that���s funny because I think of him as working part time in Philadelphia.
What card was she?
I know. I know what to do.
Okay, well you have to show us.
I finished my laundry.  Got all my socks.  Nothing like that time that crazy guy pushed you.
Hey! What's up?
Ohh... [laughs]
That is right. Don't make any more of it.
Oh.
I thought that was your corner.
Make time for romance!
Yes.  She was a little fussy earlier, but she's totally quieted down.  Here, let me just, uh, let me just burp her.  I don't want her to spit up on you.  Come here, sweety...  Oh, my God!  Wrong baby!
I really like Valentine's Day in this office. It's kinda like grade school. Everybody gives out little presents and stuff. Like last year, Jim gave me this card, with Dwight's head on it, it was horrifying and funny and...
Let's go. Pick up a paddle.
No.
[reluctantly] Everybody dance now��� [Darryl continues singing]
There's that ass!
What?
[door opens] Hey, Phyllis. You all right?
[in a car with Andy, by the dumpster you can see a new computer box] So listen, we have to really scuff this up.
Guess what?
Role call.
But that's okay. Because it's not about being perfect, it's about trying.  In fact, why don't we go around and confess some of the ways that we've fudged on some of our resolutions?
Hey. You made it.
Hey! Our baby was not a mistake. She was a surprise.
Can't back out now, Halpert.
Twelve drummers drumming. [marching drum band lines up to perform, Andy steps out with cymbals]
Welcome back, Stanley. [Stanley grunts]
We're not dating, we're engaged.
No, no, I want my mom and dad to be there.
Yeah, yeah, no, no. It���s a good idea to brush your teeth. But you have to um, feed your children. Send them to school. You know, all things you can���t do if you just keep singing ���Monster Mash.���
Yeah. And he worked here too.
So you invested ten thousand dollars to look like a team player?
We're not dating, I'm engaged.
[on Bluetooth speaker] Hey, New York ain't free. Get back to work.
You didn't say anything to me?
What?
OK. [Goes out onto terrace] Oh wow, you have a nice view.
I can sign for it.
Exactly.
Really?
I mean it's a very competitive field. But I have a professor who says I have a lot of promise, and if I don't try now, I never will. So...
What is going on?
Umm, [gasps] yearbook!
So, Stacy and Eric get to Bogre's DeTech half an hour early so they don't have to sit on the slab.
Yeah, I think the pregnancy really brought us together.
Hey, having fun?
Sure, uh, Jan... um, do you know, is anyone coming back to Scranton?
This is over.
Shut up Oscar.  What is wrong with all of you, he is sleeping with my mother!
It's not Brian's fault.
Something like an obstacle course, Mr. Grinch?
Let's see. Andy has been manager for a hundred and five days. Which means I've heard 'Closing Time' a hundred and five times. [nods and shakes head] Still don't know the words. Tah wa Ta way hm hm home and home and home.
This wasn't on the list.
Not yet.
And his favorite lunch.
Oh my god. I'm getting so stuffed.
I mean, help, if it's something simple, like add page numbers or laminate it or...
Hi, can I help you?
Yeah, um, there's good things about Michael. He uh, uh... Yeah, definitely. Um...
[talks over flashbacks] Kelly has been a handful in the past.
So did everybody ...
Our friend, Seth, and his wife there.
Dwight?
Oh, no.
She's not gonna...  Just...
Yeah that seems fair.
Thank you.
Um... Oscar's kind of cute.
Yeah. I mean, listen if we���re gonna do this thing, we should do it right.
Here.
Oh my God, I think we've been robbed!
Are you wearing anything under the robe?
What? What is it? What? What is, oh, my God! [Jim starts attacking snowmen] Honey? Jim? Jim!
Where did you grow up?
No, no. Jim had a great year, actually. I just wanted to get your opinion.
[knocking on Angela's car window, Angela is naked inside] Hey in there. It's Pam. It's not Dwight! Don't think it's Dwight!
Oh!
I know.
What are you guys doing?
Oh God no, Dwight isn't my friend... Oh my God!  Dwight's kind of my friend!
I recently met Sue, the office administrator at Vance Refrigeration. She has this awesome wall full of fun initiatives and morale boosters and stuff. Sue just goes for it, she's awesome.
That was our dream wedding.
No one.
[telephone ringing] Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. Um, hold, please. [to Jim] There's a Brenda on the phone for you. [to Brenda] Just one second, I'll transfer.
Seriously? This is what's so important, putting naked pictures on the desktop?
Maybe it was Meredith. Maybe she brought in lice that are totally different than the lice that i got from Cece. So let's not jump to the simplest conclusion that she got her lice from me. That is how wars get started. Fine, I'll tell her it was me.
And, I'm freaking out.
But then you fall asleep and there's nothing for me to do.
Aw, that's so sweet! [dart fires out of box and lodges in ceiling]
I just wanted to let you that Dwight's gonna be ok.  The doctor said there's a really simple treatment for a concussion, so he'll probably even be back at work tomorrow.
[in unison] I do not think that is funny.
I'm not gonna lie to her, either.
[answers phone] Pam Halpert.
Five minutes apart.
Can you come here please?
Would any of you be saying any of this if the cupcakes were from Supermart?
So, I guess that's how they're gonna play this. It is on. [very serious] It is so on.
So what happened?
[to Jim] Hey. I feel so lucky we're in the same city for Valentine's Day.
It all happened so fast.
Do you want to try it, Jim?
[opens door] Erin.  Michael wants to see you.
What?
[recorded on phone] Excuse me, I have to get back to work.
I don't know! [Mose starts running by the left side of the car]
Okay. What? What is this?
New chairs?
OK. Yeah.
Ten minutes.
Really?
Yeah.
Michael, I think that feeling only goes one way. And I think that Ryan knows that, and he's taking advantage of you.
Hi, can I help you?
OH, Holy God!
I'm guessing Angela's the one in the neighborhood who gives the trick-or-treaters some toothbrushes. Pennies. Walnuts.
Here?
Definitely.
The Pizza by Alfredo guy is here.
Thank you.
Yeah?
Thank you.
Come here.
Everything okay?
You know, Michael. When I feel overwhelmed -
This was a terrible relationship. You were not happy when you were with her.
Well, which is worse? Snapped or stuck?
Well, as I am sure you know, for the past few months, I've been the Office Administrator. Since right before you guys took over.
Umm... it was not that long ago.
Yup.
Thank you.
Yes! I'm in a good mood today! I'm excited to meet all the new people and to see my old friend again, definitely. That's always a thing that makes people happy... to have an old friend back.
Oh! Oh!
I don't demand justice often. I'm not like Angela, who calls a lawyer every time someone watches a YouTube video of animals doing it. But, someone should get fired over this, right? Val's no help. Andy's gone. Jim's out. I just feel like I'm on my own here. [boom microphone bumps her head, she smiles] I mean, OK, not completely on my own. But, in terms of people who can do something. Thank you, Brian.
Well...this is it.
Yeah, that'd be nice.
Oh good, I'm just in time for Ping.
Oh, yeah.
Nature.
[looking at pile on Michel's carpet] Oh... I don't know.
Please stop saying what.  Can you take him?
Hey.
Michael, she's perfect for you.
I actually do mean Marlon Wayan. Yeah.
No, thank you.
Yeah. Um, do you have any other pictures of Astrid?
You didn't think to mention me huh?
I think that's champagne.
Okay, here I come. [walks out in her wedding dress]
Oh, thank you.
You're a jerk.
Roy and I just got back from the Poconos.  I get ten vacation days a year, and I try to hold off taking them for as long as possible, and this year I got to the third week in January.
I didn���t watch the whole documentary. After a few episodes, it was too painful. I kept wanting to scream at Pam. It took me so long to do so many important things. It���s just hard to accept that I spent so many years being less happy than I could have been. Jim was 5 feet from my desk and it took me four years to get to him. It���d be great if people saw this documentary and learned from my mistakes. Not that I���m a tragic person. I���m really happy now. But���it would just���just make my heart soar if someone out there saw this and she said to herself ���be strong, trust yourself, love yourself. Conquer your fears. Just go after what you want and act fast, because life just isn���t that long.���
Okay.
Oh, you're dead.
Um...
Mom, have you decided what you want to be called?
Thanks.
Oh, hey Jim. Some prankster switched the elevator buttons on Dwight.
Yeah. It's kinda crazy.
I did?
Maybe we can get him to hide and wait somewhere.
Yeah.
Hello.
Are you sure?
I got back at Frank in the most fitting way possible. With my art. The paints are water-based. It's gonna come off with a hose. But, I think the lesson will last a very...
No, you just have little dainty fingers.
Yeah, we walk around, everyone sees our faces and we leave, right?
But, no, but we are a family.
Maybe sort of ahead of his time as a writer.
Yeah.
He's really making you work for it, huh?
Oh, thank you. I acknowledge and appreciate that you went out of your way to get me tea.
Nothing.
Shh.
Okay.
I don't know how the whole betting thing started, but it's fun.
Hmm, that is... Janet Fenstermaker.
[Pam���s phone vibrates] Oh, text from Jim. ���This is getting very weird. Will explain later.���
Buddha who?
Dwight just listen!  It's underneath...  [Dwight hangs up as the policeman hands him a ticket]
[answering the phone] Dunder Mifflin, This is Pam. Oh, I���m sorry. Jim Halpert doesn���t work here anymore.
No, no, no!
There's...
Okay. Bye.
Here's what I was thinking: everyone sits on a chair every day...
[looking up from her pilfering of Bob's food] What?
Unless it's exposed to oxygen. Then it becomes extremely toxic!
[to Jim] What!  You knew?
Aw!
Yeah! Whoo! [Group cheers]
Right, and if you're interested in the way more fun party, all the info can be found here on our more brightly colored flyer. [Angela rips down brightly colored flyer and walks away. Karen rips down Angela's flyer.]
Wow! He really pulled out the big guns. Fake crying. Did not expect that.
Why would anyone go to jail for that?
Oh, you guys.  Just one second.  [picks up phone] Oh my gosh!  Are you serious?  Shipping emergency.  I don't think I can go to lunch.
Our party is also starting now [opens door to break room.]
No he hasn���t.
I don't think anyone thought that.
Sorry, that's not my problem.
...And it's all from the same series.
What was prison like?
Kelly made me realize something.  She and I have... nothing in common.  And I need more friends.
Don't you think the person who left the mess is the obnoxious one?
Because she's not a sex model.  She's a tollbooth operator.
Ohh... poor Kevin.
Oh, can we stop by that pie stand on the way?
No.
Erin.
You're back in.
Oh, welcome back, Andy.
So���what do you make of this Robert California guy? I mean, what does a guy like that do on an average weeknight?
Michael, do not let your imagination run amok.
The reverse cycling ends tonight! [Pam leaves]
Dunder Mifflin this is Pam. Uh, I'm sorry, Michael's not here right now can I take a message? Great. I will. Thanks.
What���s going on?
Mm-hmm.
I should probably head back in.
Michael, please don't.
I feel like he���s always making these decisions for the family, and then I���m left playing catch-up.
Oh I don't care, I didn't really like that place that much anyway. I'll just move.
Why would I love that? Can we afford a delivery guy?
Have you heard anything about any secret office romances?
Yes, I found it in a shelf in the corner of the warehouse. [Darryl gives the camera an odd look]
Here here! Speech, speech, speech, speech [other people start joining in]
[imitating Deangelo's pretend juggling routine] Look.  I'm juggling eggs and bowling balls.  I'm juggling with one hand.  No hands.
Nice to meet you.
The eyebrow.
Okay, you just have to use the hand sanitizer first.
Great.
[laughing] Hi.
What?
Wait, what did it say?
Well I'm having my baby first, so that's that.
Oh..
[exiting the Ladies' room] Mine too. [Pam and Jim notice the Handicapped stall and walk towards it.  Putting their ears to the door they hear Mr. and Mrs. Vance being intimate]
[laughs] Jim does the best impressions. Sometimes he'll look up at me from his desk and he'll just be someone else. Like he'll go um, [makes mournful face, giggles] that's supposed to be Phyllis.  I can't do it as good as he can.
I know we're having that harassment thing this afternoon.
Am I being mean to Dwight? I don't know. I did just make him run around the building and I have no intention of timing him. This isn't even a stopwatch. It's a digital thermometer. He does make my life harder, sometimes. And on purpose. Like he tried to put meters on the bathroom stalls as a way of bringing in more money for the company. [yells to Dwight] Hey, three more laps to go. Gotta pick it up if you're going to beat Toby.
Actually, people are really unhappy. Um, Dwight sent around this memo and people are freaking out 'cause the...
Yeah.
Oh, no.
Alright. Just don't worry, we'll figure this out.
You're horrible.
Down.  You have to sit down so I can get the full effect.
Please? Kelly's trash talking me because Darryl is beating you.
I don't think so, but they put paint where I didn't want paint. So...
Oh boy.
The professors would go to the parties?
You shot a gun off -
Hi.
This isn't about sides. This is about me seeing a blueish gray old man in the mirror and then he vanishes.
[mouths] Wow!
He's more, just... like... you can go.
That is so insulting.
Um, actually, funny story -- I didn���t get it. I shouldn���t have been so cocky about my rectangle-holding skills after all.
Yeah?
Oscar said WUPHF only has enough money for nine days.
Guys, I don't like this analogy.
Where is she?
I'm going into labor!
No, because... [Dwight and Michael walk in and march into Michael's office, silencing the conversation]
47, 48, 49! Jim wins!
Sure.
Come on, let's go. I wanna call your doctor.
Hillary swank.
I'm going to be okay, we should really try to make it until midnight.
Hey Cathy.
[laughs] I don't know. I think Michael has a date.
Good morning.
Stop drinking the water! Stop!
It���s great.
I can't tell if she's getting anything.  It just doesn't really feel right.
Where'd he go?
Um, I just wanted to say thanks.
Okay.
So, we had couple's therapy.
Okay, so here's what I'm thinking. I'm gonna say that before ceramics class, I took off my ring, and then when I changed back out of my smock, it wasn't in my pocket anymore, and I lost it.
Let me make something clear. Jim and I have never and will never have sex in the office.
[on the phone] Hey, hey! Where are you?  Can you take Andy to the hospital?
Yeah, that's right.  We could do a three-day weekend.  I wonder if I could, like, call in sick on the Friday.  Then I get a four-day weekend.
Dwight, that was really nice. You should ask for her number.
I've heard that. [reaches down to pick up bagel from the floor]
Yeah.
Ok.
So I closed the door but the image of his...
It's very important.
Michael, do you need me to call an ambulance?!
I will?
Okay Ben Franklin!
It's true.
And that's what you said about Art School, and that's what you said about sales.
Yeah, right.  God, I need a boyfriend.  You know Ryan I'm totally ready to be set up with one of your business school friends.  Whenever.
Weapons.
What's the rule about eating when people are in the bathroom?
[on Bluetooth] That was weird.
Yeah!
[over indistinct conversation] Good? Yeah, he said good, I'm good...
We have to come from a position of strength.
These are my painting clothes.I think I���m gonna do it. I am really gonna start painting the warehouse mural today. [Jim applauds]
I don't know what to tell you, Jim, but I saw a ghost.
[serves] Hyuh! [other team misses and Scranton cheers] Well, look at that, we win!
Tell him you'd like to go with him.
Because you love her?  [baby voice]  Because you love her very much?
I think there's better...
Anything to get out of that office.
Michael, this is a terrible terrible thing you've done.
That was weird, huh? It's all part of the presentation. It was confusing, right? Because confusing situations happen to us all the time in our jobs. [pauses] I'm just trying to bridge the gap between what just happened and the fact that I'm going to be doing the rest of the presentation.  [reading from the cards, in Forrest Gump voice] Sales is like a box a chocolates, you never know which vendor you're gonna get. Forrest Gump.
Mmm.
Yeah probably. Hey, Michael?
Ha,ha,ha, yeah OK.
Please don't throw garbage at me.
[Singing, Pam mumbling lyrics] Closing time, time for you to go home to the places you will be from.
Well, she can't bring this up with her.
The hospital.
[laughs] Um.
What? Honey, we talked about this.
That's great.
Well, Dwight had this idea, and I thought it was kind of crazy. But maybe that's where we are now.
I kind of am. It���s crazy.
Hey, do you have a second?
Is there-- um... you want to ease up a little bit?
Yeah, I distribute so I get all the memos.
[wearing glasses] Um... yeah, I slept over at a, uh, friend's house and, I forgot my contact solution, so... I had to wear my backup glasses... Shut up.
Jim said mixed berries? Well, yeah, he's on to me. Um... [Laughs]
What do I think? I think everybody should stay out of everybody's personal business!
Awesome.
...Oh, sorry. He's--he's dressed all in pink.
[Dwight slams something on desk] What was that?
Michael?
[sighs]
[laughs] Yeah, and uh, you basically learn how an office runs.
Hey Michael, would you get me some coffee from the warehouse?
[Jim bows to Pam; she bows back] Thank you.
Why don't you use the microwave in the kitchen, Phyllis?
No.
Reusing the Ben Kingsley, too.
[on Bluetooth] Ooh, cute shoes online.
Nothing, it's just I had to sit here all day, while Phyllis got like an entire garden delivered to her.
Ok, wait wait wait wait...
[sighs] Oh, I���m sorry. I feel like you���ve already been working insanely hard.
You didn't happen to bring any coffee, did you, Michael?
...I feel like we should go get Kevin something. Do you think we can sneak out of here?
Cause there's someone already here named Pam.
[Michael offers his coat to Pam, who is shivering] Oh, thank you.
He finally has a story everyone wants to hear... and he knows it.
And Jim can jump back in without skipping a beat. We���ll come back to visit. But I think it���s time for us to officially���
Dwight, want me to get you some eggnog?
Yeah.
We wanted to stay on the phone all day, but the company has a policy against eight-hour personal calls. So we're not telling anyone.
Besides, we have something those other people don't have, which is a home and a bed.
Thought you were millionaires, yeah. That's funny. Shoot, I knew that one.
Ummm. Oh! I'll say he's related to Richard Nixon. It's an inside joke. He looks really Nixon-y when he wakes up.
Aw you'll get through it hon. Just make a game out of it. A funny 'Jim' game.
Angela, you seem so happy. I bet you wish you were like this all the time.
Um��� yes. Definitely. With your hair ���
Ah.
Okay, they're almost here- What? Come on. If you guys are gonna be mean, could you at least be subtle? [rips down ugly photo of Nellie]
��� bad.
Hi!
Then why isn't he scheming? Or preparing to avenge?
I now find you repulsive.
Hey, Oscar?
You know it���s just herbal tea.
If you sit in the back.
I love to watch him dance.
Well, I um... I... I can't.
Hi..  I was just coming out to see what you were doing and to maybe stop you.
What happened? Did you miss your bus?
Michael, Dwight's looking at gay pornography on his computer.
Two children, yes.
My dad spent the night at our place last night.  My parents have been fighting for weeks and... it kinda sucks.  Jim's been great. But I'm gonna need to buy my dad a robe.
Uh, that seems inappropriate.
And get your flu shot. Also, I'm going to set up hand sanitizing stations around the office.
Why might some say that?
I don't think so.
I could tell Jo... or I could tell Michael.
How about the anchor?
Can you go instead?
Hey. You know I was engaged before Jim.
[to Michael who is looking at a chair catalog] Did you pick a new chair? It's been awhile.
[to Angela] It's gonna be OK.
Um, I am a little busy.
I���m so sorry.
I hate you.
Yes.
Wow.
That's okay.
Michael?
Are you really going to apply for work at Scranton Breadworks?
He's uncomfortable because you're acting weird. So you have to stop acting weird.
Once a year they bring in a little cart and they give away free pretzels. It's really not a big deal. To some people it is.
Yeah. I know, me too.
Oh yeah. That's too bad.
Yes!  Thank you, welcome to my personal hell!
Oh, yeah, this is the part where Kevin sat in front of the camcorder all night. It's great.
Not us.
What are you guys going to do?
Well that never happened.
See? That wasn't so hard.
I have the most boring job in the office, so... why wouldn't I have the most boring job on beach day?
Oh, my God.
Oh, hey, I invited my friend Julie.
Wow, you did neighborhood watch?
Sorry.
I think we should get a townhouse in SoHo...
You feel OK now?
Really? I've been putting the kids to bed by myself every night for a months. And you had to miss one phone call. Is that your truth, Jim? That's really your truth?
OK, bye.
No.
You see Dwight's coffee mug?
Do you think you could work from this? [showing Tattoo artist sketch pad] we made some small adjustments.
I don't know, I just, I really thought Jim was gonna propose tonight...
Hi, um. I'm sorry, do you have a minute? Is this a bad time?
Wow.
I don't know. I'm just hungry.
No. My goodness. You have a lot going on. With Robert and everything.
No.  I don't think I can hit you in the office.
Hey Michael, um... about three months ago, I was talking to... [Michael grabs form and signs it without reading.]
I'm not frustrated. Even if I were in Scranton, Jim and I would have days like this. We're just... a little out of sync.  You know, that's all.  Oh, great.  I washed my lipstick.
More Dundies!
Really?
I know, right? What is it? You always look so good in those things.
We should break this hinge maybe.
So, um, Michael needs us in the conference room.
[over phone] Hey baby, what's up?
No I���m just, I���m saying, what would happen if they didn���t sing it? Would they go to jail? Would they be shot?
No, don't.  I'm mad at them.
No, we don't need to do that.
Describe him exactly. What color mustard is his shirt? Yellow or Dijon?
You can't, I locked the office from the inside when we left.
No, he's actually been really nice and helpful.
[whispering] Who is it?
What's going on?
[looks over at Oscar, who is quietly watching this happen] I hope... you have a very beautiful wedding, Angela.
You just still have these messages from yesterday.
I don't think I'm asking for too much. I guess it's just the end of courtesy in the workplace.
We should have hired a professional to take our mental pictures.
[asks Nellie who is tapping a pen on her desk]. Is everything okay?
I take it back!
You should try it sometime.
One time we had an ethnic festival in Scranton. One time.
Where's Alyssa?
Phyllis.
I don't know.
Do you want me to beat him up for you?
Or enough for everyone?
And we'd like to offer you 15% off your first purchase as our way of welcoming you to the area.
Ok.
Look at her. Even I want some fries with that shake.
Oh Jim, I don't think you're going to abandon this party here all by itself.
Set
Oh, we're not interested. We're not interested at all.
I did?
I'm sorry. I had no idea.
See you later. [others say good-bye]
Why don't you go do some work?
Alright, have a good trip.
This is our first and only Valentine's Day as fiances.
I was just going to go down to the hotel bar for a little bit.
It's kind of like that lip thing she did last night, like a half snarl, half smile? I get the sense that she's very ironic.
Leave!
So um, I've been thinking about this whole chair/copier thing...
I don't know.
And then, out of that cake, pops another stripper holding a smaller cake. And then an even smaller stripper pops out of that one.
Oh my God.
[sees Ryan coming through door] Hey Ryan. Welcome back --
Maybe it's because you spent the whole year flirting with the receptionist.
Aw, Dwight. That's really sweet.
No, I know you are.
We did that. So, what's next? Michael, just stop for a second. [reaches out to take the whisk] Michael. Stop for a second.
[Breaks Roy's grip] No, I don't want to go, I don't want to.
I want to hit you.
Your realtor.
So it turns out Donna and I have a facebook friend of a friend in common, so I was able to see some of her pictures online. [pulls out picture of Donna embracing a man and smiling] This was taken two weeks ago. And this was taken the same night. [pulls out a picture of Donna kissing the same man] This photo was taken this morning. [shows a baby picture] It's Cece. [laughs] She's never gonna do anything wrong.
We'll find him.
Thanks.
Yeah, he's, uh, pretty good, huh? [to Roy] Let's get you into a tub.
Michael screened a work in progress for us, years ago, and it didn't go well. We thought it was a comedy. [flashback clip of Michael angrily leaving the conference room while the whole office is laughing at the tv] Everything pointed to it being a comedy.
Not until midnight.
PM.
Hey, what's up?
What are the odds that this is in any way real?
MmMm. You're getting colder.
What do we know about this bird?  You might think, 'Not much.  It's just a bird.'  But we do know some things.  We know it was a local bird.  Maybe it's that same bird that surprised Oscar that one morning with a special present from above.
We're not going for yogurt.
...we wanted to say thank you-
[Michael walks in dressed as Willy Wonka] Good morning, Michael.
Jim and I went to dinner a few times when he got back from New York. I talked him through his break up. It's really nice to be good friends again.
I'm in the wrong class...
What?
Yeah, whatever. [Jim holds up the card] [Pam laughs] Give it to me. Give it to me.
You're right, you're right. I'm a middle class broad. [Jim does his 'Jim face']
Do you have it with you?
Oh, no. I took a phone call in the middle of taping, and then when I went to turn it back on, I must have turned it off.
I don���t know, but it might take me a long time to figure it out.
It's gonna be fun.
They're not that bad still, babe.
Maybe you should wait before you adopt.
So, it really is just about the cupcakes.
Unless someone very close to us is in immediate physical danger, you should not be calling us.
Ah!
Hey. Where'd you go?
What about your gift Michael?
Hey, let's focus today. Make today all about focus. I'll help you.
No, I wouldn���t. I can���t even relate to that impulse. But I bet I could get us a customer complaint. I���d like to try.
I'm taking a computer animation class so I could try to do a logo.
We really did.  It was fun.
Ha ha.
Yeah, if I could have seen what he just did, I think I would have gotten angry.
No talk, I'm animating.
Roy's sister looked into it, and the application alone costs a thousand dollars.
Cool.
No.
It was me.
My husband would tell you to go for it.
Yeah?
I'm sure no one asked you to do that.
[in New York] Right Dwight is loud.
Oh! Text from Jim. ���This is...��� hmm.
You guys do a raffle?
[phone rings]  Hello?
We came to an agreement. We're going to live in a stunning pre-war brownstone at the top of a mountain.
Right... you're a sports writer in Philadelphia? Nice build too.
I mean, you bought me a house!
You know, I really do think it would be worth it to pull over and just take ten minutes to eat.
No, no. It's the principle of the thing.
Well, maybe you'll meet someone.
Great.
Um...
Listen our credit card has been cancelled and we have to deal with that, and I really can't handle the fact that you're calling us here!
Yes.
No, out! Get out now! Leave now.
It's not sterile!
Okay, Jim.
Just trust me.
Yeah. Oh, you should come to my art show, by the way.
[shushes]
Oh, well, Thursday���s tough, because of���
Okay.
Not classy.
Sold out? That has never happened in the history of jinx.
[over phone] Love you. Bye.
You know, I just think it's really important that you be productive today.
Ah.
You might want to trim it a little.
Yeah?  I lose my appetite all the time.
I feel awful.
Okay.
Oh my God.
It's not too bad. I get to shred things sometimes, do you want to see?
I know you Michael, I saw you naked.
We're friends.
Oh, I, um...
I don't think that's a good idea.
Really? That's great.
Dwight, let me up.
Michael.
Okay.
Oh.
Michael!
For the bugs.
Just because two people are hanging out, it doesn't mean that they're together,  you know?  Like people can just be friends.  And I think that it was really unfair to think that there was anything else going on.
Okay.
[holds up single sheet of paper] Um, that's all we brought.
You've already disappointed him so much.  He can't be expecting a lot from you.
OK Michael, you know what? I might have someone for you.
Yeah. I���m afraid he���s only gonna have hot dogs.
No, no.
Yeah.
[phone rings] Dunder Mifflin.
Come on.
It's fine.  Erin, you're going to go.  And you're going to make sure Michael tells the truth.
It���s all yours.
Mmhmm.  Dwight are you eating a stick?
An impression, then.  Lastly, we can't help but notice that he was by himself when he died, but of course, we all know that doesn't mean he was alone.  Because I'm sure that there were lots of other birds out there who cared for him very much.  He will not be forgotten.
You made him lose the account by screaming at him the entire time.  It's okay, Ryan.
[on the phone with a client] I just wanted to check and see if there's anything you needed before I went on my maternity leave...  Yeah, I'm pregnant...  Great, well, I'll write up the order.  Okay, thanks.
Mm-hmm.
Michael, do you remember, you specifically told me to only bring one sheet of paper? You said it only takes one sheet to make a difference. And I said, 'Are you sure Michael?' And you said 'Pam! Pam! Pam!' And then you sneezed in my tea, and then you said, 'Don't worry, it's just allergies.' Do you remember that?
Oh yeah, your mom would love that.
Should we get toppings?
I decided to come. Uh... I feel a little under-dressed... but at least I'm not dressed like a slutty cheerleader, right? Is that mean?
[whispers] That's crazy!
Sure. Just one second. Please have a seat.
Yeah.
Pro-Am race for the... They hung up.
Yeah, I would've. What about you? Come on, there's gotta be something. Between your birth and the last two days, something you just haven't had the chance to tell me.
You haven't told me.
Because the thing you're saying I'm good at, is pushing a big green button a bunch of times.
Yeah, it turns out I was, um, just grasping at straws.
Did a good job, Buddy. Now it���s time to come home.
No, it's horrible!  Jim, she might get arrested.
Bring her to the party. Yeah, we'll have Santa, and we'll play games with her. It'll be a lot of fun.
Nope.
We can't help you if you don't just tell us what happened.
I bet Michael had some elaborate theme party planned, like Scrambled Egg Saturday. [a few chuckles]
We could get Deangelo flowers.
Yeah... [they see Erin eating in her car, and ducking when they see her. Pam knocks on her car window] Hey, Erin, everything okay?
And very expensive.
I saw a ghost.
So embarrassing.
If I could get her sleeping normally I could get my life back.
So... here's the gift. You get to decide what his top secret mission is. [Jim smiles] Sorry I didn't wrap it.
I think we broke his brain. [they both snicker]
Yes, but David Wallace does. And he asked me to gather everyone to talk about stuff... That's gonna be revealed once we're in the conference room for the meeting.
Oh, cool. Hey Clark.
I don't know. It felt far.
Okay fine! There must be some way to get out of it. Even just for tonight!
Yeah.
Yeah, like Harry Potter.
Uh-huh.
Why are you here?
Don't take this the wrong way, but... you should go for that job.
I just, uh, thought you'd want to know that.
Dwight is taking Ryan on a sales call today. So if we find Ryan's body in a heavily-wooded area tomorrow, I owe Jim $30. It's an old bet, but a deal's a deal.
Her husband's a reporter.
Dwight, listen to me. Businesswomen are just normal, nice, reasonable people. Who is a nice, reasonable person in your experience?
[taking Michael's picture] Okay, uh, point at the Dunder Mifflin.
Great. Well, Let me know if you need a new chair, or anything that an Office Administrator can handle.
I don't know how I fit in with these women. Here. Or with Jan. Um... I mean we get along great. Fine. Um... I guess the person I have the most in common with is...
It's perfect. You emphasized the golf, completely omit the Florida.
Did you lose Cece?
Ahh!  I'm sorry, I didn't, I didn't see you come in.
Understood.
Oh, Michael, this is just for family.
[in conference room with the party planning committee] So Michael said we can do whatever we want cake-wise. What do we want?
Of course.
Come on.
Yeah. I love being on the road, but I especially love the time and a half pay 24 hours a day, for three days. Cause I have a mortgage now, got a bring home the bucks.
Shh. Remember your lines.
... What?
[over phone] Yeah I'm fine.  Um... my cell phone battery's low, so I have to let you go.
Is it for the bird?
Mm-Hmm?
Michael, you were expecting me, right?
[On phone] About 10 minutes ago. No, I didn't know what to say.  Yes, I know.  Um, I don't know, mom, he's my best friend.  Yeah, he's great.  Yeah, I think I am. [Jim enters] I have to go. I will. Listen, Jim... [They kiss]
Why?
Hi.
Oh okay.
[on the phone] Michael, it's Ryan for you.
Not at work, I'll try it on---
No, no, it's not a big deal, please. No. Um, Meredith can I get you something special while I'm at the store, candy, or...or one of those stylish turbans?
Kapoor and ka-desperate, he watches.'
[laughing] Well, it's not exactly a vacation.
[sees Angela making check mark on tally sheet]
I had to work late. Jan's making me keep a log of everything Michael does all day.
Mmm-hmm. [nods]
What a cute bench.
So, kinda like a receptionist.
Yeah. And he has saggy boobs.
I think it's gonna put a damper on the party a little.
There's nothing new.
Yes. But, what I didn't tell you is that I actually bought the tickets. We only didn't go because it was-
Oh stop! I am so sorry!
No she's going to love it so I think you can keep the proposal simple. You know like when Jim proposed. He just he got down on one knee and he told me that he loved me and he asked me to marry him and it was perfect.
That's a really big decision.
[enters conference room] Did you need me to take notes?
Were you painting in the dark?
Yeah, do you need a hand? [everyone joins in]
What about Meredith?
[pause] I���m sorry. Is there a question?
We thought.
On your backhand. [Jim opens the conference room door and enters]
I feel bad about what I wrote on the bathroom wall.
Because if I had spoken my truth sooner about not wanting to move to Philly, then maybe we wouldn't have had this opportunity for couple's therapy.
[on voicemail, because she's calling Jim at the same time] Hi, this is Pam.  Leave a message.
Please don't talk about my breast milk.
Hi, Michael.
Brilliant!
Maybe it should come from a man.
Michael! Michael!
Then I'm gonna end fast.
Hey, how about this one?
That is a great idea.
Think so.
You are?
They're wedding bands.
Meredith...  [copier has an error] Oh... so uh... G-44.  It's not ready Kevin!
Seems like a basic reward system where you give us points, and then we redeem those points for prizes.
Quick announcement: new year, new candy.
Oh you have to Jim? You literally have to?
I'm going with him.
Hi Nate, Its Pam Halpert.
Yeah. He said that you told him how much you love me. About how you feel when I walk in a room, and about how, you've never doubted for a second that I'm the woman you want to spend the rest of your life with. I guess he's never felt that with my mom, even at their best.
A celebrity sex tape.
I think that's mold.
Oh, thank you.  Is that um, I can't tell if I'm really producing.  I don't know if she's getting anything.
You said you checked it.
Michael, wait!  I'm coming with you.
[looks out window] Michael! Michael!
Well I know how it is. I know it's a lot of fun. I don't know how it is. Andy, this is a lame job. What are you doing here?
Uh, they're good. Uh, Jim's good. We're engaged.
Really?  I don't know.
No, no.  I still have time.
Okay.
That's right.
I sincerely doubt it.
I don't know anything about that.
Post-it Notes? What are those worth, 50 cents?
What's that come to? Like, what did they each win?
Just don't talk about the email, okay? He's gonna cancel it on his own, I really think he will.
Okay...
Yeah. Painting now. I just want to make sure that...
Well, I though we were saving money for the wedding, but apparently Roy thought it was more important to buy two WaveRunners. I don't really ever get to use the other WaveRunner that's supposed to be mine because his brother uses it and they race.
What? What do you mean, suspend me?
I could work here. I could see this.
Michael, that seems impossible.
Baby.
No no no, don't. I will go talk to Angela.
The news that you just announced?  That Ed died?
Oh, oh my gosh. Yes, but don't, don't say anything, okay? It's after my grandfather.
Okay, stop watching me.
[smiles in agreement]
No, no, I���m fine.
There we go.
I'll just stand here?
I think so. Okay.
Hey, here's your schedule for next week. Are you okay?
When it comes down to it, it's a health issue.  I should have written that.
Yeah.
Yeah. Can I fill out an application?
Wait, what?
Yeah, and there's this one when we were listening to music and it's like, it's like w were in love and we didn't even know we were in love and it's...but- Do you think Jim's changed?
I lied it's personal. It's about me and Jim. We're... I just... you're the only person I can talk to.
Yeah.  Don't fall asleep at your desk.  [Turning towards the vending machine] Oh my God.
What?
Oh yeah, sure. Um, I hope I can help.
I know how to operate my phone, okay? Listen, we���re getting close. We will talk to you later. Say, ���Bye, Daddy.���
Oh, oh.
Andy that's way too personal of a question.
That a couple of times-
[whispers on bluetooth] Good luck.
[whispers] Like... like what?
If I knew I had a week to live, I would... probably go to Europe. And South America. And the Grand Canyon. And... I would want to see the Pacific Ocean. ...It would be a pretty busy week.
Okay, Michael. Um, you know I love when you do that voice, but today, I'm so sorry. I need you to tell me that you know you're not Cece's godfather.
There's no building... it doesn't exist.
You were way meaner to me than I was to you.
And there are a lot of other people in this office who have money at stake. Other people you care about.
Kelly! Um, how are you adjusting to the move?
Yeah, its nuts. But I don't know what else to do.
Well, something's off.
[Mose serves bacon] Thank you, Mose.
Oh-oh, gosh. Oh.
Who told you that?
Did you end up investing?
I don't often miss Roy. But I can tell you one thing. I wish someone had flashed me when I was with Roy. Because that would have been the ass-kicking of the year. [small laugh] Especially if it had been Jim. He would not have wanted me to have seen Jim's... Whoo, I am... I am saying a lot of things.
I have doubts about this too. But when one person freaks out, sometimes it weirdly makes the other one calmer. That's one thing I've learned about relationships. I hate that I just used the word relationship. [Michael comes out in a suit] Hey! You look great! [checks something off her list] Let's go!
Jim.
Hey, Dwight.  You look really nice today.
Ravi, our amazing pediatrician, was asking us if we knew any girls and I said I know the perfect girl.
[in car] Hey, my aunt told me something neat.
So this is like, um, an organization station...
I was thinking that we...
Hey.
Yes!
Yeah exactly. It's my turn.
You're fantsy involves comparison shopping birthing classes?
I just mean because you know us and you like observed us for ten years and I feel like he's- I just feel like...he's so into his work right now and....I don't know, am I crazy?
Oh, hey, Isabelle.
I think... you're a witch.
Oh, thank God.  I haven't had caffeine in nine months.
You know what would go so great with this cabbage pie? Milk.
Uh... my mother's coming.
Jim is a great guy. He's like a brother to me.  We're like best friends in the office and I really hope he finds someone.
Oh, my God.  His letter of recommendation from Rick Santorum is three fifty-dollar bills.
My dad.
What?
Hey.
[to delivery men] Uh, hi, can I help you? I don't think anyone here-
I don't know what to do! Do I go tell Jo, or - I don't want everyone to keep blaming the wrong person!
Well done. And we managed to kill the entire morning.
Really? Michael went in with him?
So everyone here knows pirate code?
Oh my god. He's Michael Scott.
They are.
Okay. Well, if you think of it, I'll be here.
Okay focus. Focus.  You're in the right building, you're with the right people; what happened?
Haha, yeah.  Say more nice things.
Roy's my fiance. We've been engaged about three years. We were supposed to get married in September but I think we're gonna get married in the spring.
Oh, yeah I gave that up.
Yeah.
Whoa.
Why? Does he think you're going to Florida?
I don't think any of them are supposed to shred magazines.
Jim, that was most of our savings.
Huh. [nodding] Uh huh.
I'm on the phone.
Oh my gosh.
This is the last day of our summer interns. It's been nice. We haven't had interns for a while, ever since Michael's Monica Lewinsky incident. [interns are shown gathered around Kelly's desk, one holding a box of tissues, as Kelly cries and wipes tears] He didn't do anything sexual. [female intern opens a jar of salsa for Michael] He just made far, far too many Monica Lewinsky jokes. [Meredith rubs her breasts into Maurie's back] It was just easier for corporate to shut down the program.
Alright!
[on other end in conference room] Please hold for Ms. Black.
[leans over toward Erin] Um, hit the speakerphone button. The speakerphone button? The same button as you hit before... or sit on it.
[yawns] Yeah, or no... well... I don't know. I'm sorry. I was up all night with Cece, otherwise I'd be running this.
I don't think Jim means to say that you shouldn't touch her.
I'll take the iPod.
Darryl, oh, my gosh. How is Austin? Tell me everything. How���s the merger? I feel like I read about Athlead all the time.
Jim. Can I see you for a second?
The shipping place closes in a half hour.
Or what if...
[on the phone] Hey Kelly, my stuff just got here. [Kelly screams with excitement into the phone and Pam has to take it away from her ear]
Well the first one has a surprise factor. 'I'm a suck suck-suckidy Sabre!'
Seriously.
Um... but hey? Something kind of cool. There's this internship in graphic design that Jan was telling us about. She made it sound, like, really great.
Saw it.
Yeah. He works here. We all know him.
Ok. Bye.
I think you need to go to Florida.
Or have them sing that song! That the frog does in Looney Tunes.
I haven���t told anyone here about the mural yet. I want Jim to be the first to know. Whenever I tell him good news, he���s always like, ���Beesly!��� I love that. Only thing better than getting the job-- ���Beesly!��� [chuckles]
Me too!
Yeah, you too.
They're beautiful.
I won't. It's just that last night is really hard for me to remember because I was just a teensy bit high. Should I have not said that?
Yeah, I think we should get him to the hospital.
This is what you had Ryan do.
I���m so sorry.
Sometimes I just don't get Roy.
Hey.
Guess not.
Wait, wait. What?
Who are you?
No, I made brownies.
No, my all time favorite!
[notices Angela's intense concern] Um... let's move on. I volunteer. Did anyone have a problem with me?
There���s this balloon that has been floating in the rafters of the warehouse for, like, ever. And, okay, it���s not -- it doesn���t sound cool. You just have to see it.
���Are the pens here?
I'm gonna do it. And I fully expect to burn my feet and go to the hospital. That's the right spirit when doing a coal walk, right?
Jim, I got us that dinner reservation. Grico���s at 7:30.
That's cool.
Everyone from work is here. We weren't planning on that.
Could he still be seeing her?
Do you have any leads on a job?
[telephone ringing] Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. Hold, please. Dwight, it's the Sheriff. He said that it's really important. It's regarding your desk. I'll transfer.
It didn't have anything to do with race.
I guess that's why we have a temp, huh?
Really well thank you all.
And Sunday I'm thinking of going to that flea-market at the drive-in.
Aww.
Oh yeah I bet.
[whispers to Jim] I'm gonna do it.
No, no, he's right.
So apparently no one dresses up for Halloween here. I wish I had known that before I used greasepaint for my moustache. And I can't even take off my hat, because then I'm Hitler.
Yes, I did.
Yeah, I'd love to see them. Oh, and tell them I say, 'Congratulations.'
Hey, why don't we find like a quieter place to hang out?
Who? The -
I thought it was weird when you picked us to make a documentary. But all in all���I think an ordinary paper company like Dunder Mifflin was a great subject for a documentary. There���s a lot of beauty in ordinary things. Isn���t that kind of the point?
Yeah.
No, no never.
He's on a no carb thing. Supposedly.
Um, do we have to sleep in your parent's bedroom?
I also would like to toast Phillip Halpert, who is due even sooner. May he be a good namesake to my grandfather who I promised as a child long before tonight that I would one day name my son after him. To Phillip Halpert!
Hi.
That would have been funny.
Hello, hello. You're breaking the law.
I was hoping for a righteous mob, and I ended up with Dwight and Nellie. But, they both have a mob mentality. And, I'm pretty sure Dwight has a pitchfork in his car.
What?!
Okay, that's a lot of good ideas. Thanks
You sleep in the warehouse?
I have everything.
Maybe I should go.
What do you want from me?
Mmmm.
Hey, Hey!
No, Michael.
Do it!
That sucked. He didn't apologize. There's no talking to that guy.
Steve Martin's not dead, Michael.
What do you mean?
Basically I couldn���t tell, but I think...
Jan called. She's coming in later to talk to you.
And I took a bong hit from my Bong Water with my pimp.
Okay, okay.
I am not pr-
Hey Michael everyone's in the conference room.
Yeah. I have my copies. [holds up messed up copies]
But, umm, thanks for the break.
Did you find anything good in your desk?
I haven't heard anything, but I bet Jim got the job.  I mean, why wouldn't he?  He's totally qualified, and smart, everyone loves him... and, if he never comes back again... that's OK.  We're friends.  And I'm sure we'll stay friends.  We just, we never got the timing right.  You know?  I shot him down, and then he did the same to me, and...  But you know what?  It's OK.  I'm totally fine.  Everything is gonna be totally--- [Jim walks in]
So, how���s it going?
You can tell Michael that I'm not leaving.
That's a very rude thing to say, Kevin.
...because that's what happens every time!
Bye! Hey.
Robert, is Nellie our new manager?
What happened?
Really? Oh, my gosh! We just have the one, but she poops for four. [laughs]
Okay.
Yes.
Oookay....
Oh God! What?!
Well... I always dreamed of a house with a terrace upstairs. Plant flowers on it... stuff like that. Since I was a girl. Um... More seriously though, a husband that I love... Roy. And I love to draw. And I... I did a little in college and I'd still love to do something where I could work with art or graphic design in some way.
Hey.
Michael, are you alright?
Hi dad. Yeah Jim has shaving cream, check our bathroom.
I want to handle it.
I think you should get dressed.
And spend time with George Emerson.  That's what I would do.  I mean it's the best male protagonist we've read, right?
Ten minutes.
[smiles] Hmm.
[whispering] I���m so sorry. I hate this. You���re better.
What did Jan want?
Hi.  We did it.
Come down and... open it and you'll see.
I'm really in labor! This is happening!
There's a KISS cover band in here.
She doesn't want you to return the barrette. She's not interested in you.
And we're also supposed to speak our truths.
[putting mayo on Creed's head] Creed, I'm all done. My turn.
Okay.
Robert! Okay, oops! I deleted them all. They���re all deleted.
Well, Toby will stop it. Anytime anyone���s ever been fired, Toby���s blocked it, so���
Anyway, Bogre's TA Sarah Kaya comes in.
Dwight, can we talk about these cutbacks.
I like cheesy.
No, you had no right!
[loudly] Yeah, lunch was wonderful!
Are you pushing me off the phone?
You need to get something for your girlfriend.
It was supposed to be for Meredith, 'cause she said she likes my drawings.
Ah, no, it passed.  It's good.
I'm... painting my new apartment tonight.
Yeah, I could read it.
Michael, 5k means 5 kilometers, not 5 thousand miles. [knocks]
Oh, okay, Michael, slow down. Everything's gonna be okay.
[points to smoke] Oh, my God! Uh, Oh my God!
- the Wilkes-Barre Industrial Park.
Everyone, can I have your attention.  This is the moment you've all been waiting for. Right? [drum roll on copier]
You want to hear something sad?
Her?
It's a blessing in disguise. Actually, not even in disguise. Sometimes at home, I answer the phone, 'Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam.' So, maybe that'll stop now.
Yeah, I guess. I mean, I kinda liked my old desk mate.
Um, Jim, please, please, please, I think it'd be weird if you did it.
David Wallace is on line one.
[embarrassed] Yes, thank you. [finishes banana and hands server the peel]
The fridge.
It's not supposed to shred magazines Kevin.
Thanks Dwight.
[not looking at Roy] Hi.
Mema.
ROY!
[shakes head]
It's still me.
What?
Oh, my God.
[everyone yelling at Pam]You guys, I am so sorry! It's just been so chaotic with Jim gone, that...
What moves?
On the left.
Okay.
[Pam's car pulls out of parking lot and then off to the side of the road] I told you I'm not dating anyone. And even if I was, I don't think it's anyone's business. I mean, when I do fall in love, like when it's for real, the last person I'm gonna talk about it too is a camera crew, or my co-workers. [Jim gets into the passenger side] Almost marrying Roy Anderson was as close to Pamela Anderson as I ever want to be. [Jim leans over and kisses Pam] Trust me, when I fall in love, you'll know.
What?
Yeah.
Well, to speak my truth, I switched to coffee in March.  There's a new espresso machine. But I still acknowledge and appreciate the gesture.
I love you.
Does that mean an idea that blows up in our faces later? [Pam's phone rings]
How would wiping it with a paper towel make it worse?
I am fine.
No, they had to come back for me.
It's my first day back after maternity leave. And I miss Cece, of course. But we need the money. What was maternity leave like? Oh, how do I explain it?... It rocked. It rocked my ass off.
I just answer the phone.
That���s what he says.
You know Michael's been talking to her too.
Are you kidding me?
Yeah, maybe I'll just move in with my boyfriend 'cause he's kind of a slob, too.
Really? Okay, well, um, I like consistency in the manager's position, no weird silent coups. Stuff like that. I'm easy.
False alarm.
I know you and Dwight have this weird deal, uhm, he sent me out here to see if you could postpone.
Um...
Michael, there's a Charles Miner here to see you.
The ones that say 'love' on them?
Don't shake our baby?
Yep. I���ll talk to you tomorrow.
[laughs]
Wow.
That was funny.
This is my friend Julie.
What are you talking about? Yes we can.
I just feel kind of tired, you know.
I'm so sorry, Rolando told me everything.  How humiliating.  Would it help you to return to another age?  A time of refinement, and civility.
What's our punishment?
A delivery guy will deliver a box of pens, and you just make sure everything���s in order.
Nice.
Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam.
See you then.
Nope.
Well, we won���t be late. I love you, mom. Thanks.
Hmm.
Yeah, I'll take it. [turns to leave]
Yeah. Do you think she's hot?
Closer to the epicenter, I guess.
Kay, well, you had that interesting thing.
Yes, Jim, I think I know how to point a rectangle at something.
United front...
I finally feel ready. Athlead is growing���
Ah. Ahh. [walks out]
[hugs Michael] ... Thank you.
What is he doing?
I might go to the mall.
[sees it's a drawing of hers, framed] Wow. I didn't know you kept this.
Is it me? Is it Nellie?
I'm not gonna do that.
So, does anyone wanna know where I've been for the last 2 hours?
Yeah, I know what a loft is.
Night
Cakes really good.
Oh, wow, thank you!
What? No! Wait, no. Definitely not cancer.
Ladies and gentlemen, I think we have a winner.
Is that them again?
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. [excited] This is Pam. I did?
What is it?
You said come in!
I forgot I have to support him no matter what. Close one.
Yes, but Reception is a one person department. If I get you a new computer I have to get one for everyone in sales. For Dwight, for Stanley, it would be crazy.
Nobody.
Oh, we wanted to, but our sitter just fell through. I'm really sorry.
I won.
OK. Well, here's something you don't know. A couple of weeks ago-
[looks at to Jim] I am. [looks at Angela] It's about the Save The Date.
Michael, wait!
I'm not talking to you anymore.
[telephone rings] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Hold please.
Mmm-hmm.
She says 'no' to everything. You know, she thinks my name is 'No.' Cece, do you want some broccoli?
I like her.
Darryl, hey.
We're hoping our interview seals the deal.
[telephone ringing] This is Pam. Oh my God, are you sure? Uh, okay. Okay, um, we���ll be right there. Everybody, the balloon is falling.
Hi, Kelly.
Jan.
Yeah, enjoy this moment, because you're never going to go back to this time before you met your desk mate Dwight.
Um, hey, say Hi to Alyssa.
There's 800 of them!
Yeah. I'm in charge of this whole area.
No no no no no! She'll wake up!
Ooh.
It's okay, honey. [Philip cries] It's okay, it's okay.
Oh, I have more. [Holds up bags of candy]
So what are you going to get me instead?
We couldn't do it without you, so we postponed.
No no no, I want to see more of Philly Jim. I want Philly Jim.
Michael, do not let your imagination run out of control.
All right, see you later...
Do you...
When you cried?
Oh, yeah. Uh, I think I remember that from back from when I first started.
During the course of business, a copier goes though something called 'Normal wear and tear.'
Say it.
[laughing] That's perfect!
But have you ever actually seen him yourself?
You're welcome.  Open or closed?
49 again? That's nine years in a row.  This is now our longest family tradition.
Yeah.
[reading flavors] Despera-dough. Witchy-womanilla. Why do they do this?
Love you.
Hi Jerry.
Yeah, but you have to calm...
[after Angela gives her a stack of files]: I'm going into labor!
That one's great.
Get it.
Are you-- Twice! For real?
[to Phyllis] Can you tell us what happened?
Mm-hmm.  Yes, I'm fine.  Um, yeah, the doctor said it's still considered a minor contraction as long as I can talk through it.
Did I?  Doesn't sound like me, not very superstitious.
Hey guys, the tree's here.
I acknowledge with gratitude that you are being kind and responsible enough to include it in your calendar.
[raises hand] What is the cash value of a Schrute Buck?
Ok. Sure.
[pulling her new shirt out of a box] Ok.
Oh, thanks.
Cece's getting christened today.
I was just wondering, what kind of jobs do you guys have?
You can't leave anyone out.
Oh, hi Stanley.
Hey Charles.
I have one kitchen.
There is now. We just started it.
Oh no.
I would say no.
... dangling participle...
No, Jim, stay!
It tells me nothing.
I mean, who knows? Maybe I have a niece my family never told me about.
Actually, I have it.
Who did you tell?
Yeah!
Good morning, Deangelo.
Okay great.  [Isabel kisses her cheek] Yeah, I'll see you in a second.  [pauses] Wait, what? [tries to follow, but veil gets caught on wall and tears] Oh! Oh no!
Ok
Sure.
[Dwight hands out handkerchief] Thanks. You don't need to stay here.
What do you want us to do?
You mean Tony?
I take it back.
Can you put me down I'm getting a little nauseous?
Actually, it's kind of too bad we're not coming into work tomorrow.
Okay.
Now please.
Thanks, Phyllis.  Yours, too.
[to Ryan] I'll take those. Thanks. [throws jeans under her desk]
Oh.
[on phone] Are you kidding me?
Okay.
Goodbye. [hangs up phone]
Hey, Dwight, what about vaccines?
She's not doing it to hurt you.
Hahhh, thanks for everything.
Bye. [walks away]
So, you're okay?
Oh. Ok. I've heard you exclaim. Like the time you said, 'Hey, look. We parked over here!'.
Hello.
Dwight, you have your hand up.
Wow. That was... wow.
Uhh, I think it's something like umm...
Nice morning, too.
You know, Jim���s kind of nervous about it, but I think it could really help.
It's 'whom' when it's the object of a sentence, and 'who' when it's the subject.
No, it's not that. Um, I was just wondering, since I'm probably going to have to stay late, could you ask Dwight to stay late too so he can walk me to my car?
[interrupting] The city mirrors, or the...?
Great. I am killing it over here. [drops mayonnaise on the ground] Jim, I gotta go.
I'm going to say it anyway.
One day for what?
Yeah, the bride doesn't really do... Have you ever been to a wedding?
What does that even mean?
Yeah.  Dwight, Michael wants to see you in his office. [Dwight runs in]
I have it covered. [hands Dwight a decorated box]
Well, a gay man would not leave the store wearing those shoes!
Michael has employed Dwight to track you down.
I'm gonna spend it with my fiance.
Oh... God.  Oh my God, he's gonna jump.
Dunder Mifflin is having our first own garage sale. Like many Americans, we realized we had a lot of things that we really didn't need. And 10 cents of every dollar is going into the party fund so we can throw parties for ourselves.
Yeah, he is.
Nothing. You look nice today.
Do you want me to help you with that?
Yeah.
Why don���t I help you now?
There's an HR meeting in there at 11:30.
He just so happy to have a family plan.
Shh, shh.
Yeah, I'm just forwarding the phones.
When Michael's skirting a phone call, he gave me a list of places to say he is. 'Stopping a fight in the parking lot. ' 'An Obama fashion show. ' Whatever... that is. Or 'trapped in an oil painting.' I'm gonna save that one.
That means another twelve weeks.  [pause] Can you do this for another three months?
Do you mean, leaves as in dies? You want us to throw Toby a New Orleans' funeral?
Ugh.
No, I'm kidding. Um, so you got big plans this weekend?
What should we do now?
It's terrible.
There are a few ways to get promoted. One is to wait for an opening and apply for it. That's the main way. But this could work.
Are you talking about Beverley?
He sees it.
I love you.
No.
What was that?! [everyone runs to Michael's office window]
Oh, yeah. You really shouldn't litter.
This is Mr. Scott.
Thank you.
Well yeah, but what if we turned our mike packs?
Uh, I have to stay here and answer the phone.
Wow, that is wonderful, congratulations.
Thank you.
Okay, let���s stop here. Anyone have any thoughts?
Sorry?
I wouldn't go if things weren't so solid with Jim. And down the road, if we have a family, I couldn't go then either. So, the timing's perfect... And that is the first time I've ever used the word 'perfect' in here!
Clark?
Oh no, I was confused by your phrasing.  You should definitely go out with Jim.  I mean, you're going out with Jim.  I'm not going out with Jim.  You're dating him, which is awesome, because you guys are great together.
I think one of her cats did once. She came in with scratches all over her face. [both laugh]
They're both single, I have a sense they might-
It didn���t look like that.
Yes.
Not anymore.  It's, um... It's completely over now.
Michael started the process of selecting a new chair about three weeks ago. And normally I wouldn't care, but he promised me his old one. It's way better. It's one of these. [makes a shrrhhh sound of a chair moving downward as Pam slumps down] I really want it.
You told me to buzz you about the suggestion box meeting when Jan was here.
Are you avoiding your phone call?
And do my job?
Why don't you wanna eat lunch with your boyfriend?
Yeah.
Okay, greatest strength.
Yeah.
[points to Jim's iPod] You have new music?
Sure, yeah. Yeah.
Thank you.
Okay, well I have the tablecloth, don't forget the flatware.
[exiting house] Thanks, mom!
Jim. Jim, Jim, Jim. I'm not threatening you. I love you. [whispers] But you should know, you're on very dangerous ground [kisses Jim]. [at normal volume] All right.
Oh, right, yeah.
She never sent it to you?
So suck it.
Smoked turkey.
Do you mind if I go out for a drink with these guys?
Hi, nice to meet you.
Please be Grandma.
I am-- I am-- I am trying to make everything perfect here, okay? So that you can have everything that you want.
Please go back to your desk.
Night.
Did I wake up this morning thinking I'd be throwing together a bird funeral?  You never can tell what your day here is  gonna turn into.
[to Michael] What's the matter, you can't fight your own battles?
I only brought the one.
Week off. That'd be great.
Mmm-hmm.
I used to be young and cute and sorta funny and I could do those cute, little cartoons. And everyone who came through here was like, ���Who���s that receptionist? I like her.��� Now I���m just a fat mom. Yeah, and you take one look at me and you���re like, ���Oh, loser.���
I don't know.  I just, I can't tell if she's getting anything.
Here we go, here we go.
How much?
Thank you.  Um, listen I just wanted to confirm that you're not coming to the wedding, which is totally understandable and more than fine.
So, Jordan, uh, where did you work before?  Uh, a law office?
How can you give us performance reviews if you don't know us?
Are you going to Angela's cat party on Sunday?
You did it.
No, remind me.
When a child gets behind the wheel of a car and runs into a tree, You don't blame the child.  He didn't know any better.  You blame the 30-year-old woman who got in the passenger seat and said, 'Drive, kid.  I trust you.'
Get the keys out of my purse, start the car. [Jim and Pam slowly back out of the office, Pam has her weapon trained on everyone and then they run out]
Well, we're thinking of my grandmother who we haven't told and is very old-fashioned.
No. [Kevin leaves; Pam takes off her glasses; phone rings] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Okay, go ahead. [puts a notepad close to her face and writes message]
Very interesting.
Michael...
Oh, thanks!
What can't you tell me?
Yeah, he tried to set up my TIVO for me but then I didn't have audio for a week.
He's seriously awful!
I love it.
I am going to tell her, but now is clearly not the time.  I will buy her a wig, we'll have a few laughs. There's a right way to do this.
Thank goodness he was there.
Look, I really need this new chair. I mean, seriously, how is it possible that in five years I've had two engagement rings, and only one chair?
You don't?
Let's just see how we feel when we get there.
Oh, that duck is so cute.
You could have just told us what you were thinking.
I'm not making any copies.
No.
Do we know anyone who was in the accident?
Ugh.
So we're planning this party for Nellie, and we're gonna make it really bad.
What?
[hangs up phone] Dwight. Dwight. Can you please tell new building owner that he is screwing over all the people he works with, people he's worked with for years. His friends.
Oh. You want to talk about it?
It was the new one I did.
Hey.
[changing voice] Good afternoon Iris, it's a pleasure.
And that is...
250 dollars is nothing to the world's biggest Smokey Robinson fan.
That's what Michael said.
I forgot what a super, nice girl Katy is. And just... good for Jim! They are so cute together. And, um, what an adorable car.
You remember you fired Roy for attacking Jim and I don't talk to him anymore really.
They're not of Cece.
[opens teapot] Oh my god! The yearbook picture!
I mean, I know that we said no big gifts, but I was kind of hoping you'd get me
Well, it was, uh, it was really nice meeting you, Alan.
I'm so sorry.
I think she looks good. Now that she���s wearing sports bras, we don���t see her boobs as much.
[sits down] Oh my gosh, I have been chasing people down all day.  It's incredible.
Oh, I know.  We talked about it and he told me.
$100.00
[drowsily] I'm amazing. [sighs]
Where'd you put it?
Yeah. Good.
New pants?
We signed Cici up for this daycare. It's on the other side of town. The traffic...
Be careful. I pulled my mom's dog off a pillow once, and I got bit.
I'm not freaking out, Andy.
I'm not saying she's in love with him. But she could have left a while ago. Most printer sales are done over the phone, Ms. Boob shirt.
Hey, Toby. [walks past him to Kelly's cubicle]
Great.
Mmm hmm.
Really?
Oh my God, he hates me!
No, I mean, you're doing great, and Andy put you in charge of the whole party, right?
...what your friendship means to me.
We have good give and take. [vaudeville delivery] I give, he takes.
It would've been just as easy for him to spell insect. Of course, that wouldn't have made any sense either.
So, imagine like the real estate version of Michael Scott and that was this guy. He did half the interview as Ace Ventura.
Bye.
You've seen one of these?
Stop stalling! Come on.
Come on, it'll take two seconds.
Yeah, mostly.
You think your doctor's going to give you a C-section at six months?
[on phone]: Did you send Dwight on a quest for the Holy Grail?
[shouts] Michael Scott, are you still seeing Donna?
She said everything with the wedding goes by so fast we should try to take mental pictures of the high points.
I use to love coming here.  The chicken parm is good.  Big part of my childhood.  Oh, maybe Michael will start dating that too.
It's really just a regular shaped cake.
It's just out there, you...
I find that hard to believe... considering you have problems with every single person in this entire office except Bobblehead Joe.
[whispering] I'm so sorry. [Angela, Phyllis, and Pam all whispering] ... seriously, we're just...
Aww, my hero!
No.
The architecture reminds one of a quaint Tuscan beet farm.
Mmm-mm.  I'm probably just gonna stay here for a while, say I got lost.
The day's going fine. It's been a little chaotic but it's fine. It's great! A lot of distractions. But, it's good.
Okay.
Good. Good. And���[Nellie hits the car against the bushes]
You'll be Mr. Christmas by the end of the night.
Oh, Michael. You can't be nasty today. [whispering] 'Cause of the... [points to 'Welcome Daughters!' sign]
Hey.
We are a family.
You have no idea...
OK, yeah.
Sure, no problem.
I know!
You guys, if I knew you wanted to do a caption contest, I would have drawn something more challenging.
[exasperated]
Jim and I are pretty sure she had an affair with her ex-assistant Hunter. He was 17. But she looks great. If she asks, will you tell her I said that?
Angela?
She missed you.
This is a huge sale.
He took this job in Philly without telling me. He bought our house without telling me. At a certain point, he��shouldn't��be rewarded for that.
You mean Toastmasters?
Well, look closer.
Okay. Oh, uh, you dropped something. Jim?
That���s true.
Hi. Wow, I really thought I'd be more excited to be here.
Michael, why did you promise that?
Joe Montana!
See, I feel bad about that.
Okay, okay, we're not going to the hospital.  We are waiting until midnight.
[on phone] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh hi, David. He's having a colonoscopy. Alright, I'll find out if he's out yet.
No, not at all.
You have to tell me now.
I can't see them when they're on the floor
Okay. This one is the same price but it's got...
Who is 'Long Tim'?
Do you think Michael and Jan actually...
So now everyone hates Andy, and it's this whole mess, and I don't know what to do.
We decided that there's no way Dwight would harm a child.
Hey, Hon, are you close?
The timeline's messy.
No.  You were right.
What are you doing?
Not relevant.
Theme song from Saved by the Bell.
Mom, I'm sorry. I know you and Dad are chipping in for the wedding but I do not want orange invitations. Yes! Well, if you really want my...
That's all she said.
Brian?
Well, he seems really happy being back here at Dunder Mifflin.
I think you guys all remember my mom from the wedding.
I guess.
Yeah.
No, Michael.
Hey!
Well, I���m heading out to Cece���s dance recital.
[laughs] You're very quick on your feet. I remember you. Funny.
Jim had a crush on me on the booze cruise or he told you about it on the booze cruise?
We're not high.
[checking watch] We should probably head back.
Oh!...
He's not coming out. He won't pick up the phone.
Sorry.
Why don't you just tell him how his actions are being perceived by the women in this office?
Who talked to Maggie at Kaufman���s?
My old art room. [finds a sheet of blank paper] Oh, maybe it's still here! [looks for her painting] No. No they must have taken it down. Never mind.
Oh, excuse me! I'm fine with my choices!
Uh, huh. Yes.
No you're not.
Is...?
It's performance review day, company-wide.  Last year, my performance review started with Michael asking me what my hopes and dreams were, and it ended with him telling me he could bench-press 190 pounds.  So, I don't really know what to expect.
Where are you?
Yes!
So, you know it means I have to go to New York for three months...
I need to fit into my wedding dress. However, I'm also pregnant.
So you have an office and a workspace?
Yes.
Wow. Thank you. Um, that must have been hard for you to relive that. Both of you.
You had a nice meal with your girlfriend in a lovely place...
Come on, it'll be fun, and besides, I'm a roulette expert.
Ok [squeaking sound] Oh that was just me. Pregnant Pam. And I make sounds much worse than this.
I'm confused. Am I walking down the aisle to 'You Can Call Me Al?'
Woo! Yeah. Aw, don't take it away!
It wasn't so bad.
Doesn't your dad have high blood pressure?
Can you believe that...
Have a great time.
[speakerphone] Hi everyone!
Look, I know what you have to do, please stay with Cece. Dwight? I've always considered for us to be very good friends. Great friends! Remember your concussion?
[Delivery man enters with a bouquet of red roses. Pam stands up to look at card.] Phyllis.
The fridge, got it.
But not to us.
No.  No. [Leaves]
That was so embarrassing. I'm gonna die.
Table making never seemed so possible.
What's it like without my glasses?  Um, well, here, I'll show you.  Unfocus your lens.  A lot.  I'm 20/400.  You got it?  Okay, I'm gonna spend the rest of the day like this.  I can't see any of the things that would bother me on a normal day.  I can't see anything disgusting, or ugly, or Michael... it's great.
Michael, Michael, wait we don't have, we don't have the budget for another party.
Oh no, I just, I decided to stay.
Yeah, and when Michael gets a broken heart, this whole place comes to a halt, so we're just trying to get out in front of this.
[on phone] Yes! Yes! I would love to!
Mm. [walks into bathroom, Meredith is using her brest pump] Meredith!
Just one. 'This weather makes me want to stay at home, curled up with a good book.'
Sorry. Um, David is in Vermont. Did you speak with him? He sent Dwight instead.
[entering office] Conference room. Everybody. Now!
Why's he making her laugh so much?
It's really hard to demonstrate depression.  Their safety training had visuals.
Okay.
Yes.
Um, excuse me. I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
It's just hard to explain.
Yes. Absolutely. Right away.
Oh! Ok.
Yeah.
[to friend] Nice.
Automatic voicemail.
No, I'm not even wearing that much.
Ok, read it back to me.
Okay, be careful, Kevin. They're kind of spicy.
You have a computer Andy.
Have fun though.
OK great!
Yes, Michael, new chairs. These chairs are terrible. We were supposed to get new ones last year.
It just- [Kevin banging and shaking the snack machine]  To be making a case for passion in Edwardian times, I thought was, uh...
I thought it might be fun to set her up with someone. Any ideas?
[voicemail message for Jim] I'll transfer you.  Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.  Hold, please.  Dunder Mifflin, this is ... okay, sorry.  Michael was standing at my desk, and I needed to be busy or who knows what would've happened, so thank you.
Maybe because you hated her present so much.
Anyway, um... I miss you.
What?
Of course.
As soon as they leave, well get Kelly and start.
Okay.
No. It's crazy.
No, I mean it. [walks towards Michael] She's really nice and sweet and you guys might actually get along. [hands over card to Michael]
Put cold tea bags on your eyes.
No, no, it's fine. Just gimme a second.
...Dwight is banning us from our bathroom.
[with five popcorn bags left] Anyone else?  Nooo.
Okay. Thank you.
Ummm...
Don't, don't--
I've been warned.
I know you're a very busy man so I'll cut right to the chase. I'd like my old job back.
My job?  My job is to get married in the morning.  That's my job.
I stole Nellie���s phone.
You're not the least bit curious to hear a poem straight from Ryan's soul?
Yeah, well, get used to it, bud.
If I'm being completely honest, I could've done without the belly kiss.
Michael, we can hear you.
Good morning!
Yeah, me too.
Yes, I have a date. He's a cartoonist for the local paper, which is really neat, because I like to draw too. I'm kind of nervous. I haven't been on a first date in nine years... probably shouldn't broadcast that.
What?
No.  I read in the book about nipple confusion.
Hey. How you doing?
A suit?
[over loudspeaker, imitating Darth Vader] Luke, this is your father. Come set the table for dinner.
Oh, shoot.
I know! No, I'm saying that when I feel overwhelmed, something I like to do is make a list. Make a list of things to do and then start with the easy stuff.
Okay. Thank you for coming, Michael.
Why did you put Dwight in charge of that? He did a horrible job.
What are you gonna do?
Everyone, Let���s take our picture in front of the mural. Oh, um, I just���I kind of meant just everybody from the office.
Yeah.
[on the phone] No, no, I know that the warranty's expired, but isn't it supposed to last longer than two years if it isn't defective? OK, fine, three years.
... Square is fine.
Okay. [punches Toby's hand]
Sure. Meredith, do you mind?
Oh, well, thanks Oscar.  I was just wondering how would you feel if Michael was sleeping with your mom?
[hesitates] I am. I am the office administrator!
What?
Oh my god! I love it! Uh, I���Nellie, this is brilliant!  [sees Jim] Hey!
70? How many do you type?
You OK?
After I had my little outburst at the beach, Jim was really nice about it. He just basically said that he missed my friendship too and I would always mean a lot to him and I understand where he's coming from.  For the record, I am not embarassed at all. It needed to be said, and I said it, and it only took me three years to summons the courage, so [quietly, and mock bowing] thank you.
Okay. [turns to computer]
Exactly. Unless you adopted, of course.
The warehouse got a ping pong table last week. Now Jim comes down and plays with Darryl. Sometimes I bring him juice. My boyfriend is 12.
He locked himself in his office all morning working on it.
[giggles at Roy]
When are you ever responsible for your actions?
No, you should go for it. I mean nothing would've happened with me and Jim if he didn't put himself out there.
Good choice. [Kelly drags Ryan to the break room.]
Oh, wow. I forgot how pretty your house is.
Oh.
I am not going to let Kelly throw her life away on Ryan. And it has nothing to do with access to my pediatrician. Why you would even ask or were going to ask, because I- I felt like that question was coming.
I have a ton of stuff to do for the wedding. And I have to do it in the office. And that can be kind of awkward. Um... just because people can get all weird about wedding stuff. Then... I just... I don't want to offend... Angela... or someone.
You've been watering down the soap?
That there are no rules.
Congratulations!
He does everyone in the office.
Right?
Irrigation.
Ok, just get to the good part.
Sure.
Just terrible.  And the longer you put it off, the worse it's going to get.
Night, Michael.
Nope. 'Cause we're really nice people but you don't seem to like us.
Stuff gets around. I don't participate.
Oh, yeah... Maybe.
I'm done. What are you... Is that supposed to be my mural?
Don't... get... on. Do not.
You ready?
Separate rooms.
Just listen.
[Pam and Jim are sitting in Jim's car in front of Detroit Coney Island Chili Dogs] This is the best burger I've ever had, babe.
I still need... you know, my breakthrough, or whatever. [Woman leaves, Roy enters] Hey, babe, how are you?
No, it doesn't have to just be cow stuff, right?
I think the tree looks nice.
Are you good?
No I think you explained it.
I don't know, I kind of hate all our regular places right now. Oh, you know what [Jim gets down on one knee], that one...
[voicemail message for Jim] Hey, Jim.  It's Pam.  I keep looking up to say something to you and then Michael's there and it's horrible.  Anyway, I'm bored.  Come back!
[sighs] Who's there?
We���re so excited.
Stealing? What am I supposed to have stolen?
Bye.
I think it���s good. He likes fishing.
Hey.
Michael once told me that Home Alone is the saddest movie ever. When I asked him why, he said, 'Because the whole family forgets the kid at home. There is nothing funny about that.'
Oh, my goodness.
New York, as it turns out, is very expensive, and I ran out of money. I thought about selling a kidney, but Michael offered to get me a part-time job at corporate.
[referencing the ���tiny wheel���] Toilets! [everyone cheers as Meredith accepts her chore]
Okay, Ryan Howard, yes.
[laughs] I like that song.
Thanks.
Okay, thank you.
Meredith, I am so sorry.
Is it because of Michael? Did he actually do something?
So you guys, you know what's an even more useful treat...is cash. So-
Maybe she's just pushing her breasts together to make them look bigger.
Mmhmm.
He's nice and he seems interested.
Yes, the conference room is set up. I've got pens, I've got paper, I've got a whiteboard, we are good to go!
Okay.
Michael, let me make this very easy for you, I could give a sh[beep] about your happiness!  Stop dating my mother!
Oh, hey Michael! I'm just going to go to Carbondale to price some shredders. I'll see you later.
So, what do you say we get started?
Thank you.
Jim, I don't want the first thing the baby hears to be the 8 Mile soundtrack.
Here we go!
Mmm-hmmm.
Yes. Thank you, mom.
Ayyyy!
No, it's passing, it's fine.  It's okay.
Hey.
I can help you with that.
No, just do one. Two question marks is kind of aggressive. You know it's like wha-what?? Just do one.
Dwight, I don't think he's going to hurt anybody.
[Pam and Meredith singing karaoke] This one's for all you ladies out there.
Hey, Angela.[hands her a Save The Date card] I didn't have your zip code.
Like what?
He can only keep one of us as a salesperson now.  He'll make his decision by the end of the day.
No, I mean doing that with Michael. How do you come back from that?
Well, you were never really engaged.
What? [Jim shakes his head] Did you want to tell me something? You look like you want to tell me something. [Jim shakes his head no] You look like you have something really important to say and you just can't for some reason. [Jim smiles] Come on, you can tell me. Jim, you can tell me anything. [Jim stops smiling and looks down. Pam wonders what that means]
We got the van at a used car lot.  We think it says 'Alleluia Church of Scranton.' in Korean.  It was either this or an old school bus with an owl living in it.
Oh, no. Um, I, I'm embarrassed. It's stupid.
What are you doing?
Oscar, Toby, and I are founding members of the Finer Things Club.  We meet once a month to discuss books and art, celebrate culture in a very civilized way.  Sometimes the debate can get heated, but we're always respectful.  There is no paper, no plastic, and no work talk allowed.  It's very exclusive.
Helene.
Oh, damn. [Pam looks down at her salad] They've been in there for like ten minutes.
Hey.
So about this proposal thing...
It was two.
It's a good shredder, it just keeps breaking.
No, Michael, no.
[smiling] I hate you. [walks away]
I almost lost it. That was too good.
Yes! Phyllis!
Yeah.
A baby.
No, I mean, it feels...  pressure.
What? [opens her eyes, Michael is standing over her] Oh...
It doesn't really seem like you.
Yeah, I guess I could.
Hmm...
[after Michael returns with coffee] With cream and sugar?
No, I met his wife in Mommy and Me. They're a great couple. You should meet them later.
We don't normally download films illegally.  Because we're honest,  hardworking people.
No thanks.
You're typing 'Big Boobs'?
He's going through a break-up.
Try paperclips. Oh wait. This message. For Dwight.
How about that one?
Hi, Pam, hello.
That's... right. He's like Marlon Brando.
Me, too.
I know.
[Nate starts walking away from hornet's nest, puts down the blowtorch] Yes!
Andy, I am getting married in 8 hours.
Hey, I would just love to schedule a meeting today with Dwight.
It was great.
Let it go.
No, I should probably go too.
No. Roy? No.
What are you so excited about?
I mean, we���ve having issues. It can���t hurt to talk about them, right?
...and he said, That's what everyone sees, that's the Man In Black.
Nope, and we're gonna need a loaves and fishes kind of miracle to feed 'em all.
Good game!
There's a person here...
Kevin.
Here's what we think happened.  Michael's sidekick, who all through the movie is this complete idiot who's causing the downfall of the United States, was originally named Dwight.  But then Michael changed it to Samuel L. Chang using a search and replace, but that doesn't work on misspelled words, leaving behind one Dwigt.  And Dwight figured it out.  Oops.
No, right, no, no.
We only had tonight free, and we really wanted to spend it with you.
Hmm?
I thought I'd stay and answer the phones.
I'll just get a ride home from Angela.
