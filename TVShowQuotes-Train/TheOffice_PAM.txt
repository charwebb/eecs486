I'm kind of in-between boyfriends right now. So I don't need anything sexy. But I do need some new hand towels. I figure I can cut up this robe.
You just still have these messages from yesterday.
I am not going to let Kelly throw her life away on Ryan. And it has nothing to do with access to my pediatrician. Why you would even ask or were going to ask, because I- I felt like that question was coming.
Yeah, Bob Vance took her for a walk to calm down.
Oh, okay, Michael, slow down. Everything's gonna be okay.
No, okay. It's fine. It's fine. We're just gonna add 'find office'...
There's a person here who wants to sell handbags.
Oh, you guys.  Just one second.  [picks up phone] Oh my gosh!  Are you serious?  Shipping emergency.  I don't think I can go to lunch.
I wish that you'd stop rubbing that lamp in that creepy way.
You know, I really do think it would be worth it to pull over and just take ten minutes to eat.
Look, I really need this new chair. I mean, seriously, how is it possible that in five years I've had two engagement rings, and only one chair?
I know a lot of us have been feeling under the weather lately. It's that time of year. And according to a study done by the University of Arizona, they've discovered that your keyboards have hundreds of times more bacteria, per square inch, than a toilet seat.
Hey, why is it so quiet? Shouldn't the phone be ringing? Uh-oh. Erin set the phone to voicemail.
What could he possibly stand to gain from a real juggling routine?  How can you keep defending him?
Okay. I'll go look for another one. [she leaves]
Well, to speak my truth, I switched to coffee in March.  There's a new espresso machine. But I still acknowledge and appreciate the gesture.
Jan used to be one of my superiors, and she is one of the most erratic and terrifying people I have ever met.
One time we had an ethnic festival in Scranton. One time.
A world where you truly can be anything you want.
That's weird. I mean, that's weird to have sex in the office. That's where you work, right?
Dwight, want me to get you some eggnog?
I should just go.  [accent]  Where to now Caleb?
Well, Toby will stop it. Anytime anyone���s ever been fired, Toby���s blocked it, so���
When I get eight hours, compared to like six hours, like, big difference.
[in a car with Andy, by the dumpster you can see a new computer box] So listen, we have to really scuff this up.
There���s this balloon that has been floating in the rafters of the warehouse for, like, ever. And, okay, it���s not -- it doesn���t sound cool. You just have to see it.
Do you mean, leaves as in dies? You want us to throw Toby a New Orleans' funeral?
But Andy does, so we have to watch it with him.
Oh my gosh. The honeymoon was great. We met this other couple at the resort, Frank and Benny. We hung out with them a lot.
Oh, my God. When Dwight said no one wants to come in on a Saturday...
I don't think it would be the worst thing if they let me go because then I might... I don't think it's many little girls' dream to be a receptionist. I like to do illustrations. Um... Mostly watercolor. A few oil pencil. Um, Jim thinks they're good.
Do you want us to count to three?
Oh, yeah, in my fancy new apartment. I have one bedroom, one bathroom, and a closet.
We should have hired a professional to take our mental pictures.
Why? Does he think you're going to Florida?
[pointing to staff members] Blazer. Freckles. Penguin. K.D. Lang. Holly's boyfriend. These mnemonic devices help to make a connection, and then, also to help you memorize names. I have a chainsaw! [holds up chainsaw, makes a wimpy chain saw noise] Cutting down the competition.
Dressing up as somebody-I mean, when has that ever worked for you?
Angela made several 911 calls about cars going too fast in front of the building, so the police put up a radar gun. It's actually caused a bit of a traffic hazard.
I can't tell you specifically, but... it's not over.
He's not here. I don't know where he is.
You don't look reluctant, Michael. You look really eager.
[whispers to Jim] Hey.  Something just happened.  Dwight just told Angela that she has to deleted all of her sensitive e-mails immediately.
I'm sorry I thought this job was for the position of office manager.
Hello everyone. We would just like to announce that our party is starting now in the break room. So... you can come by... .
When are you ever responsible for your actions?
Oscar, wait. I think the victory would be more meaningful if Erin puts the last word in herself.
Oh, my God, [eating a bar in the hallway] I thought I was gonna pass out.  [Jim takes it from her and takes a bite]
No, uh, me Stanley and Phyllis so far.
Yeah. I was kinda hoping you could. I gotta go. Bye. [to Dwight] Come on. [camera pans to Clark duct taped to a chair]
Oh, wait, I gotta go, class starting. [hangs up]
Has she been on the phone the whole time?
Hey Dad. No I know, Mom told me. Ok. Yeah I'll see ya then.
Hey, good luck. When you get to Philly, will you tell Jim I miss him?
I'm sorry too.  I just, I think that we both made some bad choices.
Yesterday, they delivered the new one. But they didn't set it up. So my day just got a little more interesting. [holds up a huge manual]
Dwight mercy killed Angela's cat.  It's very complicated.  It's caused a lot of unpleasantness between Dwight and Angela.  Who are both already prone to unpleasantness.
W.B. Jones is renovating their offices and their construction crews are taking up some of the parking spaces we used to get.
How far away does she live now, like ten minutes?
You know what? I'm sick of this! Let's go, you and me!
What possible explanation could you have for possibly being here? I don't... you know, babies shouldn't have ice cream, by the way.
Oh. Ok. I've heard you exclaim. Like the time you said, 'Hey, look. We parked over here!'.
Okay. It's been a little more tiring than I thought.
Yeah?  I lose my appetite all the time.
Michael tends to procrastinate a bit whenever he has to do work. Umm, time cards, he has to sign these every Friday. Purchase orders have to be approved at the end of every month. And expense reports, all he has to do is initial these at the end of every quarter. But once a year, it all falls on the same Friday and that's today. I call it the Perfect Storm.
Okay, so here's what I'm thinking. I'm gonna say that before ceramics class, I took off my ring, and then when I changed back out of my smock, it wasn't in my pocket anymore, and I lost it.
It's performance review day, company-wide.  Last year, my performance review started with Michael asking me what my hopes and dreams were, and it ended with him telling me he could bench-press 190 pounds.  So, I don't really know what to expect.
If you propose to me during a Michael meeting, I will say no.
Okay. Sorry. We'll uh, we'll leave you alone.
Oh, damn. [Pam looks down at her salad] They've been in there for like ten minutes.
And that was fun. But what about a year from now?
A delivery guy will deliver a box of pens, and you just make sure everything���s in order.
That's cool. [opens the container and smells the tiramisu] Mm, good stuff. [throws it in the garbage]
I know that it took me a little while to come around and its still a little weird to get used to, but you obviously make my mom very happy.  And that makes me happy.
Yeah. Hey Michael, look at this lamp. $8.00.
Merry Christ--[looks up] NO! Why... why did you bring that here?
He left it at reception and we photocopied it.
I hate the idea that someone out there hates me. I even hate thinking that Al-Qaeda hates me. I think if they got to know me, they wouldn't hate me. But Karen knows me, and she still hates me, so...
Oh, hey, Jim. Wait, stop. Um, I'm sorry... for pushing you towards Cumberland. Seriously, if you left here, I would blow my brains out.
[Jim comes out of the office]  What's the news?
Well I like to think that his dad was a Ben Franklin impersonator and he really pressured him into it.
[to Jim] Hey. I feel so lucky we're in the same city for Valentine's Day.
[exchanges looks with Jim] You're right. We should've realized that you are an equal part of this.
I'm setting Michael up with my land lady. She's really sweet and... whatever, I just can't take Michael like this.
Why are you assuming you'd get the whole thing?
Michael, Ryan wants to introduce the branch managers in a few minutes.  You just have to wave and introduce yourself.
Dunder Mifflin this is Pam. Uh, I'm sorry, Michael's not here right now can I take a message? Great. I will. Thanks.
It just- [Kevin banging and shaking the snack machine]  To be making a case for passion in Edwardian times, I thought was, uh...
Um, I don't think so, I just bought it.
Come on, it'll be fun, and besides, I'm a roulette expert.
Yeah, he's, uh, pretty good, huh? [to Roy] Let's get you into a tub.
[over phone] Yeah I'm fine.  Um... my cell phone battery's low, so I have to let you go.
You know, Michael. When I feel overwhelmed -
Like the main company number? Because I'm gonna have to call information.
[Michael offers his coat to Pam, who is shivering] Oh, thank you.
A few months ago. I was talking to someone at corporate, who isn't there anymore, and I think the paperwork just got lost in the shuffle. Can you believe that?
Well, other things you can do to help cut down on the spread of disease are to wash your hands regularly. Don't come in if you're sick.
Andy's family had a total meltdown.  His dad blew through all their money and took off to Argentina with a younger woman.
It���s probably gonna be a few minutes. So you can just go back to doing whatever you were doing.
Oh, and then this was Phyllis���s idea���[shocked cheers] So nasty Phyllis!
Yeah, I would've. What about you? Come on, there's gotta be something. Between your birth and the last two days, something you just haven't had the chance to tell me.
Oscar, Kevin, this is my sister, Penny. She's also my maid of honor.
Hey, Erin. Do you mind faxing this for me?
What's the rule about eating when people are in the bathroom?
You mean the frozen mice for the piranha?
Cece was around 22 weeks, but Phillip was much earlier.
No, I mean, you're doing great, and Andy put you in charge of the whole party, right?
How are you, Isaac? You have something in your ear.
[putting mayo on Creed's head] Creed, I'm all done. My turn.
Because I got it at Blockbuster and they don't put the pictures on the box.
Shut up, Hide! ��I mean, do you think Kevin cares what people think about him-- or Creed or Meredith? Oh my gosh, these are my role models now. You know what? I���m okay with that.
Good. Very good. [cell phone beeping]Oh���no! Here. It's, uh, a text from Andy. ���New special proj. Need fam tree for evbody. Really dig up dirt A.S.A.P.��� And then in parentheses, he wrote out ���as soon as possible.���
[to Jim] Hey! You can just give her your extension.
I know that Jim has an amazing story about a relative of his who got caught up in the world of drugs.
Michael likes me to run the camera when he makes his apology videos.  He says he needs a woman's touch.
That's not a real knot. When you pull on it, it disappears.
I thought we were just having fun at the beach.
Dwight just listen!  It's underneath...  [Dwight hangs up as the policeman hands him a ticket]
[on phone] Dunder-Mifflin. This is Pam. [listens] Uh, yeah. [snaps her fingers in the air, getting Jim's attention] Just one second. I will, uh, transfer you to our manager, Michael Scott.
Uh, I'm sorry Andy, but this is a closed club.
Don't you think it's better to tell him the truth now? You know, rather than waste more of his time?
So one afternoon, while walking home from school, quirky 10th grader Becky Walters finds a wounded Pegasus in the woods.  And she becomes...The Horse Flyer.
Just to reiterate, none of us is going to say anything that might indicate that we are going broke.
Yes. It is. And thank you so much for setting up this opportunity, I really appreciate it.
[Andy shakes his head 'no'] Oh. No, no. [laughing] We're not together. No, no, no. Definitely not. Definitely not. No. We just work together.
Jim, Jim, honey, I love you, but you're really distracting me from my distractions.
I feel good. [sees a huge pile of French toast] Wow.
I���m back. Oh, hey, look, and now it���s like a double date.
Um, excuse me. I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
Oh, I made us a date to take my mom out to dinner to thank her for all that extra babysitting.
No. I mean, I don't know, I don't think so.
No��� don���t. Just put it out of your mind.
No, it's fine.  I'm sure it must have been weird for Jim when Roy and I were joking around... that
Dwight. [to Troy] Michael will be out in a second.
I did it. I learned everything about this machine.  I know all the buttons, even the inside ones.   I know all the error messages.  I could do a bound book, in plastic with offset colors.  Which feels...
[voicemail message for Jim] Hey, what's that word we made up when you have a thing stuck in your shoe?  Anyway, I have a thing stuck in my shoe.
What if I back out and you finish the pitch with Jim?
[talks over flashbacks] Kelly has been a handful in the past.
O. [hits the ping-pong ball, and it hits the net] [serves] P.
Okay, Michael. Um, you know I love when you do that voice, but today, I'm so sorry. I need you to tell me that you know you're not Cece's godfather.
It didn't have anything to do with race.
We just had to add a few more tables. We weren't expecting this many people.
I thought we were having a nice time.
As soon as they leave, well get Kelly and start.
That's a sad story. I have another one. We move, the other tenants follow, the bank takes the building, takes your farm, takes your car and beats the crap out of you. Penniless, you die, and my daughter Cece dances on your grave... fully clothed. [lights turn off, Pam and Dwight begin to wave their arms to alert the sensor]
Michael, Michael, wait we don't have, we don't have the budget for another party.
So we just... we wanna help you plan the proposal so that it's safe and responsible and realistic and doable.
They said they were done with the investing and then you volunteered ten thousand dollars?
Hey, Michael, where have you been? [Michael shoots pool ball up into their faces]
Hey. You have a bunch of messages and... [sees Michael shaking head with beads in hair] that's nice. Hannah quit while you were gone. I guess she memo-ed to file some complaints she had about being a working mother? And so you might also have to be deposed.
Nope.  I, like you, have never been here before.
[holds up rice krispie shaped like a star] In the name of Nutcracker Christmas.
Okay, everybody! After you walk the runway everyone has to vote for who gets the coupon book. And you can't vote for yourself.
[an Asian lady tries to enter the van] Oh, oh, excuse me!  Sorry. Sorry, no.  It's, uh, it's a paper company now.  It's not for the church.
Oh yeah, sure. Um, I hope I can help.
Plants and- hi, Robert! Hey, um, how are you doing? Good to see you again.
[looking at pile on Michel's carpet] Oh... I don't know.
Do you want me to beat him up for you?
You're- You know your assistant told me that you have a big pitch meeting today. With Ryan Howard. How did that happen?
I know how to operate my phone, okay? Listen, we���re getting close. We will talk to you later. Say, ���Bye, Daddy.���
Thank you. I appreciate that you appreciate that.
I know, you don't like to be frazzled.
Seriously? This is what's so important, putting naked pictures on the desktop?
Well, um, you can scan it, and then you can upload the image, and then you can copy the new image.
Uh... no. I just uh had some other stuff I had to do.
Oh, it's Creed's birthday today.  Should we get him an ice-cream cake?  Mint chocolate chip?
I did. And it's just one of those things that's going to keep gnawing at me, like 'gnaw, gnaw, why? Why didn't he? I have no idea why.'
Good. I thought you were going out for a drink with...
Every night, Jim and I watch an episode of The West Wing together on DVD.  Um, he wanted to watch Battlestar Galactica and I wanted to watch Cranford... so we compromised.  Next we're gonna watch Cranford.
And we'll make sure Dwight doesn't do anything C-R-A-Z-Y.
Sure, uh, Jan... um, do you know, is anyone coming back to Scranton?
I know you and Dwight have this weird deal, uhm, he sent me out here to see if you could postpone.
Well, you know... actually, I kind of need to stall a bit. But, it's okay, because I am very used to killing time.
Yeah, he tried to set up my TIVO for me but then I didn't have audio for a week.
Yes! They're the only two gay guys I know. But they should be together.
If you're using more than three pieces of tape to wrap a present, you're doing it wrong.
But I've learned to love again. [puts her arm on Jim's shoulder] He's a cartoon sailor.
Oh, I don't know... [Jim laughs, phone rings] Oh my God.  This is Jan's cell.
[in unison] I do not think that is funny.
Will you just, will you grab Clark real quick?
Because I just wanted a relaxing evening at home...
I don't know how I fit in with these women. Here. Or with Jan. Um... I mean we get along great. Fine. Um... I guess the person I have the most in common with is...
Yeah, I distribute so I get all the memos.
[sighs] Oh, I���m sorry. I feel like you���ve already been working insanely hard.
[gets up and walks over to Angela, whispering to her] Hey. Thanks for ratting me out!
Okay. Look at this, look at this. Baby picture.
Did I?  Doesn't sound like me, not very superstitious.
Yeah, I'm gonna do some mock ups, and then turn those into thumbnails, maybe do some... splash frames. [laughs] I don't know what I'm talking about but I'm excited.
And he wants to take the WaveRunners to the lake this Saturday so...
You made him lose the account by screaming at him the entire time.  It's okay, Ryan.
Oh yeah.  Gotta get your REM cycle going with the whole sleeping.  Better than not.
[Jim bows to Pam; she bows back] Thank you.
Fine! [eggs splatter all over his robe] Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm happy for him.  I hope he gets the job.  I really just want him to be happy.  And I know that sounds cliche.  And I know saying it sounds cliche, sounds cliche...  Maybe I'm being cliche.  I don't care.  Cause I am what I am. [thinks] That's Popeye.
Oh. That's totally cool. You can do whatever you want.
I hope you got sound on everything. I'd love a DVD of that. [at computer opens translator. Types in ���Elskere��� which comes back as ���lovers��� Pam smiles]
Hey, Deangelo, my mom just sent me this picture of Cece, it is so adorable.
Yes, of course, we could've just been doing this the whole time, but SOMEONE dropped the ball.
Here's the thing.  When Michael invents a hypothetical situation, he eventually turns it into an actual situation.
[Michael is Army crawling around the office] Michael?
I'm not frustrated. Even if I were in Scranton, Jim and I would have days like this. We're just... a little out of sync.  You know, that's all.  Oh, great.  I washed my lipstick.
Sometimes when we IM, I send you that little winking face with the lipstick.
Oh, no, it's just that if a vampire had to cough, he would do it like this. [coughs into elbow]
[looks over at Oscar, who is quietly watching this happen] I hope... you have a very beautiful wedding, Angela.
Erin, you don���t need to call him that.
Okay, heart-shaped jewelry is not something that a woman buys for herself. A man definitely bought it for her recently, and it wasn't Michael.
Yeah, we don't want them at the wedding thinking Jim's being marched down the aisle by my dad with a shotgum.
Okay. Um... here it is. Don't put your fingers in there. [shreds paper] Cool huh?
Do you want some aspirin, because you seem a little fussy.
I don't know how the whole betting thing started, but it's fun.
So the sports marketing business that Jim told everyone about except for me?
We only had tonight free, and we really wanted to spend it with you.
[Michael sits alone eating at the back of the kitchen, Pam comes in with Jim, Creed and Kevin] You should do more stuff like that.
I just did not realize how hard it was gonna be without Jim. I mean, I really respect you for being a single mom all these years. It whipped my ass in half a week. I have to say, there are not a lot of people who could pull off a shaved head, but you are rocking it.
You are never going to be my father, you get out!
Hey!  [gets up to greet Helene] Hey. Happy birthday.
And looks so handsome in his UNIFORM! Please?
Hey!  Jim! Um, listen, can I call you back in a little bit?  I made friends!
Uh, could we come in too? Just for some water.
We invited everyone in the office to our wedding.  Even though we realized most people wouldn't be able to make the drive to Niagara Falls.  [whispers] Which is why we're having it in Niagara Falls.  [normal volume] Then Michael told everyone they could have Friday and Monday  off, if they came.  So now, people have to decide if they want to come to our wedding or have to work.
[sees Angela making check mark on tally sheet]
Um, actually, funny story -- I didn���t get it. I shouldn���t have been so cocky about my rectangle-holding skills after all.
It���s getting tougher. I just didn���t know that it was gonna be this hard.
[on phone] Yes! Yes! I would love to!
Well, I remember why I dress the way I do at work.  But I'm gonna keep the clothes.  I mean, it'll be cool to just have some after work clothes that aren't pajamas.
Dwight, stop. I'm not kidding, I mean, I need you to take care of yourself. What would we do if something happened to you?
Oh, my God! It's incredible. [Jim reaches and steals his card back before she can notice it] Is this the Boggle timer?
[in New York] That's what she said! That's what she said! That's what she said!
Jan called and asked where you're going to meet for dinner.  She wants you to call her.
Oh, excuse me! I'm fine with my choices!
Frank and beans! [both laugh] So what'd we decide for Michael, the bottle of rum, or the seashell alarm clock?
Maybe we can get him to hide and wait somewhere.
[wearing glasses] Um... yeah, I slept over at a, uh, friend's house and, I forgot my contact solution, so... I had to wear my backup glasses... Shut up.
Michael has employed Dwight to track you down.
I love my Mom. Okay. That's probably really the most obvious statement ever.
Yes! Because with all of your support, by this time next year maybe I'll be down to one glass of iced tea a week.
I think it's interesting how Forster uses Italy to represent sexuality and passion. [Kevin dumping change in the snack machine] And that also brought up themes of, uh, you know, fate and coincidence.  And Lucy's torn between these two things.  She's torn between passion and convention.
Hold on, hold on.  It isn't midnight yet.
I, I was gonna say, I think that um, we're gonna help Roy's cousin move.
Okay, Okay. Um��� so��� this past year has been really great, and you���ve been great and I just��� I know that you had to make this choice and you had to give something up for me. But I never want you to have to give up anything. I just thought if I could get us an offer then there wouldn���t be anything standing in our way and I could come to you with this big Jim gesture��� and show you all at once just how much I love you and how much I really do believe in your future.
Don't you think the person who left the mess is the obnoxious one?
Jim set up a job interview for me today in Philly. It's um, with a real estate company, which is a great fit for me because I live in a house and I know what a bathroom is. [laughs] I'm sorry, I am just very nervous because honestly this is all moving a lot faster than I expected. And, and because my resume can fit on a post-it note.
Look at the huge offices Jim, check out that conference room.
I can tell Michael's mood by which comedy routine he chooses to do, the more infantile, the more upset he is. And he just skipped the Ace Ventura talking butt thing. He never skips it. This is bad.
We were supposed to go to the barbeque at Jim's house.
This could be real. Dwight's pretty handy with computers. He fixed my laptop once.
So, it really is just about the cupcakes.
You know what, Michael? For what it's worth... I was wrong, too. I thought she was interested in you.
You know, there are a lot of guys out there who would just love and appreciate a-
It's just so dumb. [chokes up] But when he describes himself as a child, lost on the life raft...
Guys, I'm proud of us. I think we did the right thing. [after noticing Angela easting cupcake] Hey!
Why aren't there any beans on this very old, frizzy-haired picture of me?
It's just good to stop a Michael train of thought early before it derails and destroys the entire town.
[to camera, tearing up, smiling] I'm sorry, what was the question?
I don't know!  Let's go by the house and get it.  It's only twenty minutes past the hospital!
Um, I don't know if I really see you two together.
If you talk to her, you're gonna tell her about Stanley, and that's gonna seem more suspicious.
He took this job in Philly without telling me. He bought our house without telling me. At a certain point, he��shouldn't��be rewarded for that.
I'm sorry. Did that? That was out of the blue-
Oh, boy. Maybe your heels are too high.
Um, do we have to sleep in your parent's bedroom?
Oscar said WUPHF only has enough money for nine days.
Thank you! Thank you. I got it. Now I know. You thought I was a little dorky. You know? [gibberish sounds] Okay. Well, excuuuuse me.
It's really hard to demonstrate depression.  Their safety training had visuals.
No, I wouldn���t. I can���t even relate to that impulse. But I bet I could get us a customer complaint. I���d like to try.
I guess some new people might be coming from Stamford. Should be fun. New blood.
[to Michael] Oh, would that make you feel better?
I bet Michael had some elaborate theme party planned, like Scrambled Egg Saturday. [a few chuckles]
I thought it might be fun to set her up with someone. Any ideas?
So, I just wanted to confirm that you're not coming to my wedding.
Oh, we wanted to, but our sitter just fell through. I'm really sorry.
Yeah. I have my copies. [holds up messed up copies]
One, and then wrap around.  It's okay.  Hold that arm down.
[screams out in the parking lot, Michael watches from his office window]
Oh, yeah, because we were kind of dramatic in the beginning. Well I don���t think anything���s gonna change in our lives now. With work and two kids there���s just-nothing interesting is going to happen for us in a long, long time.
Hold on a second. [turning] Wait, what did you just say?
I acknowledge with gratitude that you are being kind and responsible enough to include it in your calendar.
No. We're gonna make it like a prank. Like order bad food, give her this passive-aggressive card.
[leans over toward Erin] Um, hit the speakerphone button. The speakerphone button? The same button as you hit before... or sit on it.
Well, I guess it doesn���t look that cool either. But, it���s been up there a long time, so it���s become a pretty big deal.
Yes. But don't get too excited, 'cause I didn't have a lot of time this year.
You need to get something for your girlfriend.
Last week, Michael sent out this mysterious memo.
Hey, Angela? Did you hear about the Irish-American Cultural Center mural?
No, they have been dating for like two years. [Jim in shock] Since before your barbeque.
You'll be Mr. Christmas by the end of the night.
Yeah? [stops laughing] It was though, that's what happened.
I have this little vacuum cleaner that's broken.  If Dwight doesn't work out, maybe that could be manager.
Yeah, I changed them to your new address.
I have so many people to thank for this award.
Don't take this the wrong way, but... you should go for that job.
Michael just rented The Devil Wears Prada. He has his NetFlix sent here to the office, and he watches them in pieces when things are slow.
Well a giant check costs about $200.00 to make up. I have a print shop standing by but... What do you think Michael, that's over 25% of our funds?
My fiance has plans for us this Saturday.  So I really hope that Dwight doesn't make me work. Maybe I should sleep with him? I'm kidding, kidding. Totally kidding.
Yeah, we walk around, everyone sees our faces and we leave, right?
Oh, great. I forgot mine and I'm wearing a two piece.
Hey Michael!  I have a present for you, but you have to come down and get it.
Jim, just don't think of it as degrading. Think of it as, you happen to be moving the six inches his way and he happens to be biting it.
So when do I get to hear everything? Are you still getting unpacked or... you want to grab a coffee or something after work?
Hey, Michael. [Michael is sitting on couch outside his office] How you doing?
It's like mommy and daddy are fighting. Except mommy outranks daddy and mommy is way scarier.
He just so happy to have a family plan.
The goal of this meeting is to get everybody excited about their resolutions! Who's been good about their resolutions so far? Erin. Tell us about it.
Ready! [flips sketch pad showing tattoo possibilities] ���I���m not as think as you drunk I am!��� [crowd claps and cheers]
We're the party planning committee, and we did not get where we are by playing it safe. We got here by being risk takers. And, yeah, Dwight's party is gonna be terrible. Maybe. Maybe it's not. Maybe it's going to be great. And if it's great...I think we all know what that would mean to us.
Maybe I played a little in junior high... and in high school... maybe a little in college... and went to volleyball camp most summers.
Roy's right. There's no guarantee it's going to lead to anything anyway.
Yes, let's go. [looks at Erin and nods]
Say that I'm lying or say that I have the job. Make a definitive statement, Gabe.
[opens teapot] Oh my god! The yearbook picture!
Yes, I know, but it's gonna be different.
So we shouldn't help you, no matter how much you might beg and plead?
[Clears her throat] The party planning committee, minus Angela, has decided that we're all going to do Dwight's Christmas.
She's talking about the handprints that celebrities make in the cement.
You missed two big conference calls today, one with corporate.
I decided to come. Uh... I feel a little under-dressed... but at least I'm not dressed like a slutty cheerleader, right? Is that mean?
Uh, no, I um. Everything's pretty much the same here.
[Jim hits a ceiling panel] I don't think he's in the ceiling, babe.
What was that?! [everyone runs to Michael's office window]
Jim, I got us that dinner reservation. Grico���s at 7:30.
What could Jim have said to make my dad want to leave my mom? And at what point in our marriage is he gonna say it to me?
What are you talking about? Yes we can.
So, let's say my teeth turn to liquid and then, they drip down the back of my throat. What would you call that?
Yes, Michael, new chairs. These chairs are terrible. We were supposed to get new ones last year.
Yeah, just a little, I have a lot to deal with today.
Yes, I have been working with you forever.
Hi. Wow, I really thought I'd be more excited to be here.
Sure did. I was as surprised as you, but apparently, he is very passionate about public art.
No, I mean it. [walks towards Michael] She's really nice and sweet and you guys might actually get along. [hands over card to Michael]
It's awkward asking people for money, but we could really use it. Why doesn't Crate & Barrel let you register for a toaster full of cash?
Yeah, we should do that for real sometime.
I have the lowest sales record of anyone here.
Hey, have I told you you look really nice today?
HEY!  COME ON!  Let's listen to Dwight's presentation! [Dwight winks at Pam]
Oh no, don't, don't, don't, don't. [Michael laughs] Aah! [laughs, then leaves] Okay...
[Pam���s phone vibrates] Oh, text from Jim. ���This is getting very weird. Will explain later.���
So, not the ring then? The- the- Not doing the ring?
Michael, I think that as the boss you should really---
Ok, um, why don't we just finish the game? Michael, it's your shot.
Well it was great catching up with you. And I'll see you around the building.
I think one of her cats did once. She came in with scratches all over her face. [both laugh]
I'm so sorry, Rolando told me everything.  How humiliating.  Would it help you to return to another age?  A time of refinement, and civility.
Okay focus. Focus.  You're in the right building, you're with the right people; what happened?
Michael once told me that Home Alone is the saddest movie ever. When I asked him why, he said, 'Because the whole family forgets the kid at home. There is nothing funny about that.'
Then I'm gonna run fast in the middle.
That's okay I can... I'm fine. I'll just play a song in my head.
Nope, I don't have a card, but I'll do you one better. A little scrap of paper.
Yeah, I think I made the right choice.
Yeah, and there's this one when we were listening to music and it's like, it's like w were in love and we didn't even know we were in love and it's...but- Do you think Jim's changed?
Yeah, I wanted to show you something in the lobby. Come on.
We were hoping you could do something like this���
Well... it's just that the weekends aren't good because, um...
You think your doctor's going to give you a C-section at six months?
For the record, I wanted go another direction. Which was way better.
Got it. I will put out a A.P.B. Otherwise known as a 'Ask Pam Beasley'. ... Did the phone cut off?
Whoa! Hey! That is not OK. What are you gonna do about that?
Angela, you have to put a stop to this right now.
There are a few ways to get promoted. One is to wait for an opening and apply for it. That's the main way. But this could work.
Oh, thank you.  Is that um, I can't tell if I'm really producing.  I don't know if she's getting anything.
Yeah, he's so great. Remember how it felt when he cheated on you though?
You're right, you're right. I'm a middle class broad. [Jim does his 'Jim face']
Is this what I've become? Materialistic? Shallow? I feel horrible. [looks down at the check] oh look! 'Mrs. Pam Halpert!' That's the first time I've seen it in writing!
No, I get it, of course. OK. [holds out hand for folder. Jim gives Pam back the folder.]
You're so much happier now. Just go in there and be strong.
[approaching Michael at elevators] Michael? [to others] He's over here!
Okay, here I come. [walks out in her wedding dress]
But that's okay. Because it's not about being perfect, it's about trying.  In fact, why don't we go around and confess some of the ways that we've fudged on some of our resolutions?
You guys, I don't think any of us are really qualified to be giving Holly personal advice about her love life.
Alright, I will get a card at the hospital and we'll sign it outside her room.
Yeah, I gave him a ride home because...
[on the phone] No, no, I know that the warranty's expired, but isn't it supposed to last longer than two years if it isn't defective? OK, fine, three years.
Yeah, but I mean, if you really like this person, then you should see where it goes.
[walks into a movie theater showing The King's Speech]
I don't want to look at your friend Jasmine's boobs all day.
I mean, it's not a big deal, but I think a lot of people from the office will be there.
Oh, okay.  Well, Michael wants to see everyone in the conference room. [Jim shakes his head. Seems relieved to be getting away from Kelly] But you know what? We have a few minutes so you guys should definitely finish up your conversation. [Jim nods his head as if to say, 'Gee, thanks, Pam.']
Okay. [walks to conference room with Andy and stares at the sign up sheet with wonder] When did people sign-
The two people with the lowest sales in the quarter have to do them.
Andy, why should she have your crappy computer?
Phyllis, if you could switch to a different soap, just for a month or two? Yours is kind of perfumy.
He locked himself in his office all morning working on it.
She's sweet and cute. I thought you'd get along.
I shouldn't tell you this, but... AJ won't commit to Holly. And she's gonna tell him that if he doesn't propose to her by the end of the year, it's over.
We need to come up with one realistic thing that we could do today.
Okay, I'm not going.  I'm not...  It's fine.   [Jim, Michael and Kevin try to help her up] Okay, come on, come on.  No!  I am not going!  I am not going, okay!?  I'm not going today because I can't do it, I don't think I can do it.
Movie Monday started with training videos, but we went through those pretty fast.  Then we watched a medical video.  Since then, it's been half hour installments of various movies, with the exception of an episode of Entourage, which Michael made us watch six times.
I had to work late. Jan's making me keep a log of everything Michael does all day.
I called the doctor like a week ago.  I couldn't wait...  Oh, God, don't be mad.
I still need... you know, my breakthrough, or whatever. [Woman leaves, Roy enters] Hey, babe, how are you?
I'm here. I'm a part of this now.
I'm the office administrator now, which means I'm basically being paid to be head of the party planning committee. The first thing I did as head... I shut it down. At its best it was a toxic political club used to make others feel miserable and left out. At its best it planned parties.
Hey.  I'm not going to get in the car, because I know if I do you'll try to drive me to the hospital.
I'm sorry. You guys have probably noticed my stomach's a little more sensitive lately. So, if you wouldn't mind wearing a little less perfume... and if your lunch is especially pungent, maybe have it in the break room?
Does it have to do with these shopping bags filled with hot dogs?
Forget everything we taught you.  Hey, Jan! It���s so great to see you.
All right. You can go. Give him his gum.
[answering the phone] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. I'm sorry, he's not in yet. Would you like his voicemail?
We're small, but we're eager to make a name for ourselves.
Ok, that's uh, good news [Pam sees Angela eavesdropping] Uh, yeah, no I'll let you go.
And also there is no such thing as a rabies doctor.
Look, I'm not the one who asked you to do a split when you've never done one before.
Michael we don't know what you're talking about...
Does this have anything to do with what you were talking to Andy about?
Okay, first, work out. And, hey! Look! You did that. Check. [Michael doing leg lifts] Eat an enormous breakfast. Check.
[Ryan and Kelly make out in the nook] But she's had a bad influence. She's like an addict. [Ryan and Kelly argue] And I just had to get her clean.
And when they were both in the third grade, Jim was placed in the top reading group.
[exiting the Ladies' room] Mine too. [Pam and Jim notice the Handicapped stall and walk towards it.  Putting their ears to the door they hear Mr. and Mrs. Vance being intimate]
We discuss... [Angela and Phyllis giggle] the idea of doing the party totally normal. Like, not mean. Just a regular party. [giggling stops] Not mean.
[to Dwight, who is reading the want ads] Should you really be so blatant about that?
Tomorrow I start a three-month design program at the Pratt Institute in New York. I will be a little fish in the big apple. [does hand gesture] What up, 212?
Yes, Jim, I think I know how to point a rectangle at something.
You were way meaner to me than I was to you.
I don't demand justice often. I'm not like Angela, who calls a lawyer every time someone watches a YouTube video of animals doing it. But, someone should get fired over this, right? Val's no help. Andy's gone. Jim's out. I just feel like I'm on my own here. [boom microphone bumps her head, she smiles] I mean, OK, not completely on my own. But, in terms of people who can do something. Thank you, Brian.
Maybe this is good. Finding another job is a pain. There's another annoying boss, another desk, I'd have to learn everything all over again. So, there are reasons to stay.
Wow, this place is��� so great. I had no idea ��� on the phone, you made it sound kind of dinky.
Give it back for what? What're you gonna do with it?
We stole Dwight's trashcan and she found some of his early attempts at his sign.
Ryan, you should be more sensitive. It's obvious she likes you and comments like that, they just...
He could have broken your nose or something.  Crazy.  It's just so stupid.  I mean, getting back with Roy and everything.  I mean, what was I thinking, right?
Wow. Thank you. Um, that must have been hard for you to relive that. Both of you.
No, under no circumstances can you read that letter. It's a violation of her trust.
Race had nothing to do with it. I just knew they'd be good together.
Oh, you mapquested it. It's four blocks away.
[Dwight slams something on desk] What was that?
You know what? I'm gonna get a hose. Then we'll talk about it. Ok we'll figure it out. Be right back. Just stay there.
Why won't you just admit that she's attractive? It's kind of annoying that you won't say it.
I think you're thinking of The Hunt for Red October.
I'm going to be okay, we should really try to make it until midnight.
Well, I mean, it's an iPod. But ..
I asked Tom and Pete to come early so we could play a prank on Jim at lunch! Pretty awesome, right? I think they're into the idea. They're probably thinking, 'That Pam Beasly, she's the coolest sister-in-law on the planet. She's the best! The absolute best.'
Usually the day we talk about sexual harassment is the day that everyone harasses me as a joke.
Every time Michael's in a meeting, he makes me come in and give him a Post-It note telling him who's on the phone. I did it once, and he freaked out. He loved it so much. The thing is he doesn't get that many calls. So he has me make them up every 10 minutes.
You're probably upset that I'm even at a Laundromat right now.  But, don't worry, I'm being safe.  And I'm headed home.  I'm... headed to my dorm.  Not home.
Do you mind if I go out for a drink with these guys?
I could tell Jo... or I could tell Michael.
Wait. Can you back up? What's the story?
[throws resolution board away in dumpster] Lesson learned.
Angela, you're the chairman of the party planning committee. I shouldn't even be planning this, it's your job.
Ten years ago, I didn���t care if Dwight  got married or died a beet-farming bachelor.  But having kids makes you so soft. I used to watch Pulp Fiction and laugh, and now I���m like, that poor gimp is somebody���s child.
Yeah, and when Michael gets a broken heart, this whole place comes to a halt, so we're just trying to get out in front of this.
Michael, I think that what Stanley did to you was rude.  Maybe you should just get him aside and tell him that he was behaving badly.
He's not coming out. He won't pick up the phone.
This is weird with you facing the other way.
[hesitating at the bribe] Yeah. You know what , I think I saw ONE sick day down there.
Yeah, well if it breaks all the way I can get you a new one.
I���m sure Athlead will be a huge success. But I don���t want him to do it anymore, and I don���t want to give him an ultimatum, but I am not moving our family to Philly.
Today's a 'women in the workplace' thing. Jan's coming in from Corporate to talk to all the women about... um... I don't really know what. But Michael's not allowed in. She said that about five times.
[sits down] Oh my gosh, I have been chasing people down all day.  It's incredible.
So, Jordan, uh, where did you work before?  Uh, a law office?
It's like squishing a spider under a book.  It's gonna be really gross but I have to look and make sure that it's really dead.  Sooo... [to camera guys] If you guys see anything... ?
I ran into this guy from my high school who has just gotten divorced and he hit on me. In the mall. And I didn't tell you because, I don't know, I felt embarrassed. And, I didn't know if you would be mad or worried. But, anyway, I thought you'd want to know.
Get the keys out of my purse, start the car. [Jim and Pam slowly back out of the office, Pam has her weapon trained on everyone and then they run out]
I think... I mean, I don't know what it is but...
[shouts] Michael Scott, are you still seeing Donna?
Roy has a connection. It's nicer than you think.
[walking into the annex with Jim] Hey, um...
Well I think they'll get the spirit of it.
Because you love her?  [baby voice]  Because you love her very much?
I just helped someone out. It feels good.
Wait a second, I thought you said that you were hurt.
Yeah, I get to do this like, every week.
But these were not the kind of people who use their words.
Oh, no everything's great! Um, I was just calling to see how the meeting went.
No, no, no, no. Undo that. Undo that.
Really. And I don't know about you, but I don't know of a lot of happy marriages that start off with an ultimatum, do you?
I can't believe Angela. I went against my better judgment, and I gave her a Save The Date. And now it turns out she complained about me to Toby.
[to Ryan] I'll take those. Thanks. [throws jeans under her desk]
Oh, well, thanks Oscar.  I was just wondering how would you feel if Michael was sleeping with your mom?
No, no, no, it's fine. I was just commenting. We gotta get these out, open 'em up.
He's uncomfortable because you're acting weird. So you have to stop acting weird.
[loudly] I need you to sign this! So bad!
Good. We watched a video about our changing bodies.
Hey, Dwight, um, my friend is kinda into these two girls that he works with.
Hey. [walks up to Oscar and hands him a report to sign]
I can't tell if she's getting anything.  It just doesn't really feel right.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. No, no, no, no.
I don���t think you guys understand why we���re doing this. It���s-
Yes. But, what I didn't tell you is that I actually bought the tickets. We only didn't go because it was-
Unless he has a secret costume that he told everyone about except for me.
I think maybe there actually is something I don't know about Jim.
And we need bodies in both these rooms, people. So please sign up.
Hon, I wish you would have told me an hour ago, when you knew you weren���t gonna make it.
No, it's horrible!  Jim, she might get arrested.
[laughing] I'm just saying, Roy is very competitive.
[on Bluetooth speaker] Hey, New York ain't free. Get back to work.
[points to Jim's iPod] You have new music?
I figured I'd catch you walking to your car, but...
We came to an agreement. We're going to live in a stunning pre-war brownstone at the top of a mountain.
[People playing casino games as the actual Casino Night begins] Oh, my God!
Yeah, no, he asked for you specifically. He's in the conference room.
No it was really it was really sweet. It was raining and..
I got Erin a new computer, because the one at reception sucked. I should know. And I don't wanna say the other one was old, but its I.P. number is one! [laughs sheepishly] Right?
Here's what we think happened.  Michael's sidekick, who all through the movie is this complete idiot who's causing the downfall of the United States, was originally named Dwight.  But then Michael changed it to Samuel L. Chang using a search and replace, but that doesn't work on misspelled words, leaving behind one Dwigt.  And Dwight figured it out.  Oops.
Oh I don't care, I didn't really like that place that much anyway. I'll just move.
It's OK. You know what they say, a change is as good as a rest.
Every so often, Jim dies of boredom. I think today it was the expense reports that did him in. And our deal is that, it's up to me to revive him.
[voicemail message for Jim]  Sudoku. Level moderate. 18 minutes. Suck on that, Halpert.
I forgot I have to support him no matter what. Close one.
Post-it Notes? What are those worth, 50 cents?
A dozen different pies? Cause that means rhubarb.
Oh, my gosh! People keep blowing it out of proportion! It's not even a history.
Oh, I know.  We talked about it and he told me.
[to camera] What? I'm not in love with her.
I didn't tell you about the crying because I didn't want you to know how upset I was. Because it would've stressed you out and you're always saying how much you don't want more stress.
No Dwight, not the good peanut butter. People are going to get mad.
Michael, I think that feeling only goes one way. And I think that Ryan knows that, and he's taking advantage of you.
It's perfect. You emphasized the golf, completely omit the Florida.
I thought I'd stay and answer the phones.
That's good. [Michael continues to play conch shell]
When was the last time you went to the doctor?
Good, especially after I took all your money in poker.
Ok, well, sometimes the gift is really about the gesture, you know, like what it means, instead of what it is.
I'm done. What are you... Is that supposed to be my mural?
He told me how he felt and I guess I had feelings too, and we kissed.
[Michael comes out with Vikram, arms raised] We got Vikram!
Yeah, that might be weird. Overall though, we still all have our jobs... so, good news, right?
I'd also like to say a few words if that's okay.
I thought it was weird when you picked us to make a documentary. But all in all���I think an ordinary paper company like Dunder Mifflin was a great subject for a documentary. There���s a lot of beauty in ordinary things. Isn���t that kind of the point?
I've been working forever on Jim's present. He always gives me the best Christmas gifts. He'll take a memory or a private joke, and he'll create something totally unique. I love them. So this year I made him something. A comic book. It stars Jimmy Halpert, a mild-mannered paper Salesman who, while riding his bike through the forest, is bitten by a radioactive bear, becomes 'bear man'. Wreaks havoc on the office. It's really good.
I traded with Dwight. Just, I figured, you know, you went to a lot of trouble and it means a lot. And also, Roy got me an iPod or was going to get me an iPod, so ..
I'll go.  [stands up, begins speaking with a southern accent]   My name is Deborah U. Tante.   Deb for short.
Did you wanna do that now? We can go inside. I'm feeling kind of good tonight.
Because I���m so glad you���re back, baby, but I���m just���I was talking to Darryl, and he was talking about the trip, and I just feel like you���re giving up so much.
But, ah, I suppose the second one is the better written line.
[Pam and Meredith singing karaoke] This one's for all you ladies out there.
Yeah, the bride doesn't really do... Have you ever been to a wedding?
You know Oscar every time I make this lasagna people ask me if it's a family recipe, but really, I just get the recipe from the box!
I think you need to go to Florida.
What? Come on guys. We need to figure out who did this and punish them. This isn't just about me. This is about all of us. This is our mural. Don't you see? How much we worked on this? How much time and energy? We put our heart and soul into this thing.
Awesome! I'll leave it up here so everyone can enjoy it.
Of course, now Michael knows where to reach me 16 to 18 hours a week.
Dwight, listen to me. Businesswomen are just normal, nice, reasonable people. Who is a nice, reasonable person in your experience?
Let's just see how we feel when we get there.
It is extremely stressful, planning a wedding by yourself. It's like a job. I mean, it's fun, but it kind of becomes like work. I've already planned it all out in my head. But it's just in my head.
No, no, no, no talking. Jim is not allowed to talk until after he buys me a coke.  Those are the rules of jinx, and they are unflinchingly rigid.  [Jim puts money in drink machine, selection is sold out]
So, does anyone wanna know where I've been for the last 2 hours?
The unfair thing about working in sales is that your salary is almost all commission. So, you suck at sales, you make almost no money. I guess that's fair.
Hey, Oscar, come here. Oscar, this is Matt, and um, Matt loves your pate.
[her text tones rings] Dwight stopped the device!
Yes, I invested in WUPHF. It's actually a great idea and I can't believe it didn't exist before. And I know Ryan's kind of a sketchy guy, but hey, I married Jim. I've done my part for the nice guy. Now I want a bedroom set.
There's nothing better than a beautiful day at the beach, filled with sun, surf, and uh... diligent note-taking. [holds up notes]
I still can't believe he didn't tell me.
Yeah, but there's other, better people out there who are helping.
Hey, Karen. Sorry about that meeting today, that was really crazy.
No, it doesn't have to just be cow stuff, right?
[knocking on door to Deangelo's office as loud yelling comes from inside it] Hey!  It sounds like you guys are having a lot of fun, but it's really loud, and some of us are trying to work, so do you think you could do it a little more quietly?
Okay, well, I just sorta meant, like, cute, right?
Yeah, but I mean, look at the salary. And it's definitely a step up. And a challenge.
Hey, I was talking to Cathy. Turns out she is single.
[goes to punch Michael; he flinches] You have to keep your hands down, Michael.
Oh, my God.  I didn't even have to do the 'C thing.'
You know, stuff people didn't intend for everyone to see. And they kinda want to know how much.
Yes, and then we decided that was crazy.
Okay-- just-- don't ever date a member of my family again.
I can't see them when they're on the floor
And then, remember, we went shopping the next day to buy me a washer and dryer?
[on phone] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Just a second. Michael, it's Jan on the phone for you.
[Hunter's voice starts singing, Pam joins in] One night...
That's the weirdest possible solution to the problem.
Um, just cause, that, you work together, and it might be awkward.
Oh great. Um, no, this weekend? Nothing. I'm not really doing anything.
I'm supposed to be Olive Oyl. And it makes more sense when I'm standing next to Popeye, but... Jim doesn't want to put his costume on.
The guy has an algorithm to determine the winner of any given college basketball game.
Different colored paint. I wanted different colored paint in the spots where they put their paint. So, it just is... OK, the point is, these warehouse guys are vandals. And, they need to be stopped.
There's some filing, restocking the supply shelves. Replacing the water jug, which nobody likes to do. Um, we... uh, eat a lot of cake!
So, detour. We're now adding Nashua to the Lecture Circuit so Michael can confront Holly and get some closure. Nashua actually sounded very excited on the phone. I don't think they get a lot of visitors. Because their office is only accessible by cross-country skis. Hey-oh! [laughs] [whispers] I've been driving too long.
[on the phone] Hey Kelly, my stuff just got here. [Kelly screams with excitement into the phone and Pam has to take it away from her ear]
[after Angela gives her a stack of files]: I'm going into labor!
I went out to look for a better office space.
I���m training a temp to be my replacement while I���m on maternity leave. Oh I should���ve mentioned I���m pregnant. You probably didn���t notice because it���s impossible to tell I���m so small. But yeah I���m pregnant. [another squeak] Oh come on!
Oh come on. You really think I'm gonna have a fourteen pound baby?
Come down and... open it and you'll see.
[outside, on cell phone] How could you do this to me? He's my boss! How many times have I complained about him to you? No, I am not being dramatic, you are being crazy!
Don't tell him I said this, but I always thought he was kinda cute.
[walking through the office, notices Andy with Erin's computer set up at his desk] What the heck! Why do you have Erin's computer!
I didn't see where it started but I saw where it ended.
I know we're having that harassment thing this afternoon.
You have a guitar slung on your back. I did not know you played guitar.
All right. I did not come back here just to see you.
Roy, I picked those flowers. Phyllis just stole all of my ideas for our wedding.
Well done. And we managed to kill the entire morning.
Well, he could still... I'm sorry about that... Oh could I just get you to sign this second page.
So we basically had no privacy for ten years.
It's just that before, you said that you didn't want any special treatment.
Thank you. [goes to Michael's office and knocks on the door]
Angela insisted that all the animals be fully clothed.
I have the worst attitude of any person here.
Yeah, right.  God, I need a boyfriend.  You know Ryan I'm totally ready to be set up with one of your business school friends.  Whenever.
She said everything with the wedding goes by so fast we should try to take mental pictures of the high points.
I'm sure she's just confused. People scratch their heads when they're confused. Not always like an ape, the way Meredith just did, but it happens.
Uh, just one second.  We're in a meeting and I'll see if he's available.  It's Jan.
I'm really happy to be back with Roy. I think it shows maturity. Maturity and dignity. ... Is that braggy? I don't mean it to be braggy.
Roy and I are saving for the wedding, so I made him promise not to get me anything too big.
Stop texting, put your phone away!  Come on.
So, what do you say we get started?
I'm pretty happy these days. I'm getting married soon and I'm getting along with everybody at work.
You know, when Holly gets back, everyone will tell her what a great job you did. And then she'll realize what she's missing.
Okay, well she takes her convictions pretty seriously, she can be kind of severe.
So���what do you make of this Robert California guy? I mean, what does a guy like that do on an average weeknight?
Dwight's health care memo. I told you about it.
Hey, um, can I ask you a question?
I have it covered. [hands Dwight a decorated box]
Let me just say, you've been promising me this chair since the day you hired me.
Oh, cause it was upside down. [both laugh]
I'm not asking if you're in to her. Just, objectively, do you find her attractive?
For the past few months I've been sending Dwight letters from the CIA. [hands a folder to Jim]
Ok. [intense moment where Jim leaves and Pam seems conflicted.  She notices his umbrella and runs out to follow him]
Hey, let's focus today. Make today all about focus. I'll help you.
No. [Kevin leaves; Pam takes off her glasses; phone rings] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Okay, go ahead. [puts a notepad close to her face and writes message]
I'm at a crucial point where I have sunk 4 hours into that copier, and I am not going to let it beat me like that wireless router did.
No, Sarah Kaya comes in.  Don't interrupt, I have like thirty seconds to finish this and get to DigiPres.
Oh, actually I don't know what I did with the one sheet. Y'know, that's the problem. You only have one sheet.
How are you Tom. Nice to see you.
Michael, 5k means 5 kilometers, not 5 thousand miles. [knocks]
[To camera] I don't care what they say, I just want to eat. Which I realize is a lot to ask for... at a dinner party.
[shakes head] It gets in the breast milk. If I drink it, Cece drinks it six hours later.
[holds up single sheet of paper] Um, that's all we brought.
We have to come from a position of strength.
Jim and I went to dinner a few times when he got back from New York. I talked him through his break up. It's really nice to be good friends again.
I make that one copy, and I become the girl who makes copies, and by the end of the day I'm receptionist again. And the worst part is, I like making copies. The paper comes out all warm and stuff. And it's cold in there. Cause it's technically a closet.
And then on the weekends, would you hacky sack back to reality and spend time with your wife and kids?
You know what, I think we should get some other input.
Um, Jim, please, please, please, I think it'd be weird if you did it.
[whispering] Hello? Yes, this is Pam Halpert. I got the mural? [Loudly] Oh, my God!
Why did I get in the car?  I could of struggled.  I have a whistle in my purse I didn't even blow it.
Oh my god! I love it! Uh, I���Nellie, this is brilliant!  [sees Jim] Hey!
Come on Andy! I mean you said you wanted a new computer and this is the best I could do!
[imitating Cookie Monster] 'Hey, Erin, You look delicious. I mean, beautiful.'
Unless someone very close to us is in immediate physical danger, you should not be calling us.
Um, Fargo, um, Edward Scissorhands, Dazed and Confused...
Not one of them called to congratulate me on our engagement.
Oh my God. Is that Jan? [points to same monitor]
Hey, why don't we find like a quieter place to hang out?
OK. Dwight. Are you really in charge of picking the health care plan?
Okay, I told her you'd talk to her.
Is that what he tells you at your little inner circle meetings?
You are going to text me, the morning of my wedding.
[Pam's car pulls out of parking lot and then off to the side of the road] I told you I'm not dating anyone. And even if I was, I don't think it's anyone's business. I mean, when I do fall in love, like when it's for real, the last person I'm gonna talk about it too is a camera crew, or my co-workers. [Jim gets into the passenger side] Almost marrying Roy Anderson was as close to Pamela Anderson as I ever want to be. [Jim leans over and kisses Pam] Trust me, when I fall in love, you'll know.
We are expecting a water delivery today at 10am. What if, as they���re delivering the water jugs, someone screams out, ���Nice jugs���?
Yeah. He works here. We all know him.
Ummm. Oh! I'll say he's related to Richard Nixon. It's an inside joke. He looks really Nixon-y when he wakes up.
it���s okay. You can sit in the annex.
I know that I shouldn't have done it. But I was in the parking lot at the Quick and Easy.
Why do you need to wear the holster at all?
Just a subway stop away are the best museums in the world.
I have a ton of stuff to do for the wedding. And I have to do it in the office. And that can be kind of awkward. Um... just because people can get all weird about wedding stuff. Then... I just... I don't want to offend... Angela... or someone.
Oh, hey, if you go by the Banshee Pub, tell the Man In Black I say hello.
Well yeah, but what if we turned our mike packs?
Um, well, I could come back as a salesman. I have experience now.
Okay. This one is the same price but it's got...
So many memories in this old gym. Pretending I have PMS so I didn't have to play volleyball, pretending I have PMS so I didn't have to play basketball. Those were the days!
And I guarantee, that you will be satisfied! 'Cause your satisfaction is our guarantee! We guarantee it. We look forward to doing business with you too. Thank you Russell.
No, I didn't mention that you cooked your foot.
They came up with that idea really fast.
Okay. I'm talking to this woman at daycare...
Great. Well, Let me know if you need a new chair, or anything that an Office Administrator can handle.
Yeah, he's making me take notes on these meetings and I'm, like, 'These people are my friends.' But he's all like, 'This is confidential. You can't tell anybody.' But I just feel like I want to... aaah. Just promise me you're not gonna say anything.
[to Michael] What's the matter, you can't fight your own battles?
Oh, thanks. My Mom made it for me.
OK. Well, here's something you don't know. A couple of weeks ago-
Hey, uh, any volunteers to come with me to go buy a Christmas tree?
Did I wake up this morning thinking I'd be throwing together a bird funeral?  You never can tell what your day here is  gonna turn into.
OK. New topic. Kelly, how are things with Ryan?
No, wait. Hey, while you are out, could pick up some paper towels and chocolate syrup? We have ice cream so I thought...
Yeah, I think the pregnancy really brought us together.
And Jim's mom suggested that Jim spend time hanging with the kids in his reading group, because she though that would be a good influence.
[phone rings, Pam answers] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.  Just one moment, I'll transfer you.
Michael... you shouldn't be with someone who doesn't make you happy.
I know. But we should go. We need to thank him for, you know, saving my life.
Okay, everyone, I've tallied the votes, and the winner... of the costume celebration spectacular... and the Scranton Wilkes-Barre coupon book... Oscar Martinez.
It's okay, honey. [Philip cries] It's okay, it's okay.
She's telling me about all her amazing trip to Vietnam, I have nothing. I tell her our printers catch on fire, spontaneously!
About 40 times a year, Michael gets really sick, but has no symptoms. Dwight is always gravely concerned.
Michael's birthday was actually pretty cool. It was a good day. I don't know... It was a good day.
[to Jim] Go up and check on him. He's upset.
[stopping her] Okay, don't turn this into some feminist issue.
Just listen. Remember that casino night about a month before we were supposed to get married? I kissed Jim.
I'm guessing Angela's the one in the neighborhood who gives the trick-or-treaters some toothbrushes. Pennies. Walnuts.
Um, I can offer you free delivery on any order that you place today. Okay, twenty boxes? I can do... just a second. I can do 20 boxes at 43 dollars a box. Great!
[with five popcorn bags left] Anyone else?  Nooo.
If you don't take out his battery, he just keeps going all day.
So he doesn't share it with his daughter but he shares it with his daughter's fiance?
Guys, I think we should all ease up on Meredith. This has got to be hard for her.
Oscar's pate is great. I could eat it all day, every day. Mmm. How come the good ones are never straight, right?
I don't think we should eat Packers' cupcakes. We can't give him the satisfaction.
Oh. Hey how about at Thanksgiving we prank Tom about being bald?
Well, we're thinking of my grandmother who we haven't told and is very old-fashioned.
Here here! Speech, speech, speech, speech [other people start joining in]
He's not saying what he needs to say.
[taking paper from Kevin] Oh that's mine! Um, I'll just, I'll get it out of the way for you.
I know, right? What is it? You always look so good in those things.
No, just do one. Two question marks is kind of aggressive. You know it's like wha-what?? Just do one.
No, I want you to say that you think the 'best' person to be our new manager is a homeless person.
Nothing happened. We went on a couple of dates. He never called me again.
[seeing Jim come in with Cece wearing an old t-shirt] What?
Hey, Isabel, you made it. Oh, my goodness.
[telephone rings] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Hold please.
Yeah, I didn't go through with the wedding.  I got cold feet, a few days before.  And I can't really explain it.  I just had to get out of that relationship.  We still had to pay for all the food.  So we froze it.  But I'm, I'm doing well.  I have my own apartment.  I'm taking art classes.  And I have lunch for the next five weeks.
Okay, just so you know, it's just the students from my class in a little studio.
Well, you��� you bought the house without telling me, so I thought I could sell it without telling you.
Oh my God, Meredith what are you doing!?
I���m afraid that you���re gonna resent me and I���m afraid that���
Oh Angela, those brownies have walnuts in them and I think Kevin's allergic to walnuts. You're allergic to walnuts, right Kevin?
I just wanted to let you that Dwight's gonna be ok.  The doctor said there's a really simple treatment for a concussion, so he'll probably even be back at work tomorrow.
[as everyone begin to leave] No, no. Come on, guys. Don't go.
So, mom... which birthday are we celebrating this year?
Oh! I'm going into labor! Oh my goodness!
Mm. Excuse me. Could I get some more water?
We wanted to stay on the phone all day, but the company has a policy against eight-hour personal calls. So we're not telling anyone.
Yes! I'm in a good mood today! I'm excited to meet all the new people and to see my old friend again, definitely. That's always a thing that makes people happy... to have an old friend back.
At this point, when you're this pregnant, it's kind of like senior spring. The other day I spit my gum out on the carpet.
Is it? I just, I liked our life in Scranton.
That's a really... well fine,  Do the German instructions say what this is supposed to do?
I got her.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay...  Jim!  She latched!  She latched.
So it turns out Donna and I have a facebook friend of a friend in common, so I was able to see some of her pictures online. [pulls out picture of Donna embracing a man and smiling] This was taken two weeks ago. And this was taken the same night. [pulls out a picture of Donna kissing the same man] This photo was taken this morning. [shows a baby picture] It's Cece. [laughs] She's never gonna do anything wrong.
Let's see.  I had an aunt that I was really close to.  She was this amazing female boxer.  Um, anyway, she was injured in a fight, and she was paralyzed.  So, you can imagine how upset I was when I found out that she asked her manager to remove her breathing tube so she could die.
Okay. When I was 22, I worked there and everybody said the place was haunted. I didn't believe it until one day before we opened, I look up into the mirror, you know, behind the bar, and I see this old man dressed all in black, but when I turn around, there's no one there. So, I tell the cook my story...
Jim's at the dentist this morning. And Steve is an actor friend of ours.
[trying to sleep as the baby cries]  Jim, Jim, get her.
Is Jim gonna propose tonight? He is, isn't he? No, he's not... Is he?
Please? Kelly's trash talking me because Darryl is beating you.
And then every morning, I'd walk out on to my terrace and I would breathe in the inspiration of the city. You know? And just gather ideas for my painting...
Dunder Miff...Michael Scott Paper Company, this is Pam. Oh, hi Russell from the pancake luncheon, how are you? Well we'd like to do business with you too! How can we make that happen?
[on other end in conference room] Please hold for Ms. Black.
Yeah, yeah, but I uh... I switched stuff around because I actually needed like more room for organization. So...
Okay, you just have to use the hand sanitizer first.
This was a terrible relationship. You were not happy when you were with her.
Okay, which one of these looks more right? [holds up drawing of Stanley with and without a moustache]
Yes, well, you guys all know Cece, but we wanted to introduce you to baby Philip.
Hi, um. I'm sorry, do you have a minute? Is this a bad time?
I find that hard to believe... considering you have problems with every single person in this entire office except Bobblehead Joe.
Whoa, Toby.  Watch out.  You're going to violate your own PDA memo.
He looks a lot like you. How much time did you spend on that?
[opens door] Erin.  Michael wants to see you.
Okay, I know I���ve been crying easily today, but- [shows unfolded paper Jim dropped, shows two lists, ���Pam��� and ���Cece��� on one side, ���Everything else��� on the other] I mean, that���s just pretty killer, right? I mean, maybe it���s stupid. No. [starts crying] It���s wonderful. I���m gonna frame it. I can always unframe it.
Wait, when did we start calling it that-
I like fire drills. You know what's the greatest? Like, when you were in school and the teacher would let you have class outside.
[faxing, Erin watching over her shoulder] What are you doing?
Why would anyone go to jail for that?
I also would like to toast Phillip Halpert, who is due even sooner. May he be a good namesake to my grandfather who I promised as a child long before tonight that I would one day name my son after him. To Phillip Halpert!
Well Darryl, no kid wants to buy their own Christmas presents.
Um... ���A���... ���X���? I don���t -- you got me.
[sees Ryan on the horse] Oh, boo! Boo! Boo to you! Boo!
[sees it's a drawing of hers, framed] Wow. I didn't know you kept this.
But don't you also have girlfriends in Paris?  Like a lot of them?
Aw you'll get through it hon. Just make a game out of it. A funny 'Jim' game.
Okay, let���s stop here. Anyone have any thoughts?
You can't fire me, Dwight, just 'cause Michael's not here.
Hey Michael, um... about three months ago, I was talking to... [Michael grabs form and signs it without reading.]
We did, but mostly because people expect us to. We're also accepting other gifts not on the registry... However much.
I'm taking a computer animation class so I could try to do a logo.
Yeah, it was great because it was like you're supposed to be working, but nothing ever gets done.
I learned from Jim, if Dwight ever asks you to accept something secret... you reply, 'Absolutely, I do.'
Can you believe my boss proposed to his girlfriend in public? That is so Michael.
Well, Dwight had this idea, and I thought it was kind of crazy. But maybe that's where we are now.
Michael, you've had two ideas today. And one of them was great. And the other one was terrible.
My dad spent the night at our place last night.  My parents have been fighting for weeks and... it kinda sucks.  Jim's been great. But I'm gonna need to buy my dad a robe.
You can flirt with someone to get what you want and also be attracted to them. How do you think we got together?
Am I being mean to Dwight? I don't know. I did just make him run around the building and I have no intention of timing him. This isn't even a stopwatch. It's a digital thermometer. He does make my life harder, sometimes. And on purpose. Like he tried to put meters on the bathroom stalls as a way of bringing in more money for the company. [yells to Dwight] Hey, three more laps to go. Gotta pick it up if you're going to beat Toby.
Well, I'm gonna say something to the producers.
I mean, we���ve having issues. It can���t hurt to talk about them, right?
[to Nellie] Maybe, maybe I could, could get the ball rolling. [Nellie nods] Um, Frank? Hi. Pam. Um, I am so sorry if I've done anything to offend you. I'm sure it isn't easy for you guys to have an upstairs person coming down in your space. So. Truly. If, if, I apologize. But enough about me. Your turn.
You know, I changed a tire today. All by myself. This bathrobe's already coming in handy. [Meredith honking] Coming!
And I've always believed that we should all be involved in everyone's personal lives, in a very major way.
You know what would go so great with this cabbage pie? Milk.
[Reading Jim's palm] You're major and minor lines cross at a ridge - that sucks.
And don't say that thing about how lots of gay guys have kids.
[in conference room with the party planning committee] So Michael said we can do whatever we want cake-wise. What do we want?
So, um, Michael needs us in the conference room.
[long pause] And of course, if there's ever anything I can ever do for you...
The day's going fine. It's been a little chaotic but it's fine. It's great! A lot of distractions. But, it's good.
Oh, okay. Everyone, remember, when he get's like this, he will wallow, if you empathize. Keep conversations light and if you get stuck, and you don't know what to do, make a random sound effect okay? Farting noise, whatever. Okay.
[pours something from the fridge into a bowl and opens the microwave, it is covered in exploded food] Oh, come on! [to the documentary crew] Do you see this?  Disgusting.
Yeah, you don't grab these [gestures to her chest] for balance.
Well, this building isn't far, and its much newer. There's a dry cleaner, nail place and a gym. Oh, and it's next-door to and Outback so it always smells like steak.
Well, I mean, How do you pay back someone for something like that? But, uh, I don���t know. I���m working on something.
So I closed the door but the image of his...
The first lesson of watching World Poker Tour at 2:00 AM, you play the opponent. Not the cards.
I think they're even. At various times you gave Jim ten points, Dwight a gold star, and Stanley a thumbs up. And I don't really know how to compare those units.
I really don't want to talk about it.  I don't mean to be rude, but I just... I don't want to comment on what happened.  It
Do you want me to ask where you're going?
Okay. Well, if you think of it, I'll be here.
You know, I bet Ryan thinks to himself 'I wish I were a volunteer sheriff on the weekends'.
I was just going to go down to the hotel bar for a little bit.
Well, looks like he really did just want to talk about the issues. i'm Sorry Oscar.
Sales people can go later in the day. Hourly works can go at lunch.
Come on Angela, don't you have a game?
Oh, yeah. I'm more than alright. There's just nothing to celebrate.
How about, Angela can keep it up on Tuesdays and Thursdays?
Oh, hey, guys! I'd like to introduce you to a new little friend of mine.  His name is New Year's resolution board.
Jim is really talented. And he should be the one who's getting a better job offer. Like, for real.
Yes. In my top three, so suck it.
Anyone want to see the video from Cece���s recital?
He can only keep one of us as a salesperson now.  He'll make his decision by the end of the day.
So my corner's the one with the copier?
Yeah, you didn't need to actually say it.
See, we knew it! If he just met her, he'd understand.
I was hoping for a righteous mob, and I ended up with Dwight and Nellie. But, they both have a mob mentality. And, I'm pretty sure Dwight has a pitchfork in his car.
Mm. [walks into bathroom, Meredith is using her brest pump] Meredith!
[ascends on lift, using megaphone] Attention, everyone. Can I have your attention, please? Yeah, I don't know everybody's name down here, but whoever did this will you please raise your hand. [no one replies] Hello? This is not over. OK? I will stay up here all day if I have to. Is that what you want? [descends on lift] Yeah, I will also come down if I want to. It's my choice.
I honestly think you're idealizing people here again, Michael. I don't think that's gonna happen.
[hangs up phone] Dwight. Dwight. Can you please tell new building owner that he is screwing over all the people he works with, people he's worked with for years. His friends.
[to Roy as Jim escapes into bathroom] Are you kidding?
Wouldn't we get fired for smashing all the computers?
Michael, do you need me to call an ambulance?!
Ok I think animals and proposals are out. Right Ryan didn't you read in one of your blogs that animals are out?
[recorded on phone] Excuse me, I have to get back to work.
Sure.  There's a transcript between a naval ship and a lighthouse.
If Dwight's about to get fired, you have to tell him. Just get the words out. That's all you can do.
No, I don't know what the future holds, but... I'm optimistic.  And, uh, I had fun goofing around with Dwight today.  Jim and I... are just... too similar.  Maybe one day I'll find my own Karen. But--- you--- that is, a, um, you know, not--- A man.  A man version.  But, uh, until then... I can hold my head up. ... I'm not gay.
Okay. I'd never heard that before. So, thank you.
No. Thanks... uh we're still having lunch today, right?
We got the van at a used car lot.  We think it says 'Alleluia Church of Scranton.' in Korean.  It was either this or an old school bus with an owl living in it.
I don't think so Michael. Besides, I can't cheer against my fiance.
Just because someone likes things clean, doesn't mean they're rich.
[to an off camera waiter and still clutching Jim's beer] Can I get a drink?
Oh... um... no.  That's... um... That's actually fine
[watches Jim score in ping-pong against Darryl] Yes! Way to go. [looks at Kelly] See that?
It's my first day back after maternity leave. And I miss Cece, of course. But we need the money. What was maternity leave like? Oh, how do I explain it?... It rocked. It rocked my ass off.
Well, I though we were saving money for the wedding, but apparently Roy thought it was more important to buy two WaveRunners. I don't really ever get to use the other WaveRunner that's supposed to be mine because his brother uses it and they race.
Are you going to Angela's cat party on Sunday?
[embarrassed] Yes, thank you. [finishes banana and hands server the peel]
Jim's been spending a few days a week in Philly and I'm not gonna lie, it's been challenging. Yesterday, things took a turn for the worse. I found out Cece has lice. So I was up all night disinfecting every sheet, towel, toy, item of clothing in the entire house. I'm exhausted. But don't tell Jim. He has a huge meeting today, under a lot of pressure and he's doing it all for the family.
And it is so cute how she signs her name.
Okay, alright, thanks...  Okay, do you want to eat?  You want to try eating?  Okay...  Okay, let me...  Just you and me.  Come on.  There we go...  Yeah...  Oh, yeah.  Like that.  There we go.  You got it.
So, umm, is this your first office job then?
Um, there was an amazing buffet and there was a chocolate fondue... station. And what else was there?
When you're a kid you assume your parents are soul mates. My kids are gonna be right about that. I guess it also means that sometimes love affairs look different to the people inside them. [Andy is in the background, looks incredulous]
Just let him flirt with her. People meet each other all sorts of ways.
[loudspeaker] Jim Halpert? Price check on fabric softener, the kind that gives you...
Oh! Yes! [Group cheers, Dwight moves to driver seat]
Okay, be careful, Kevin. They're kind of spicy.
Mmmm, that sounds great.  What are you thinking?
I guess that's why we have a temp, huh?
We can watch a movie and play Rock Band.
I haven't heard anything, but I bet Jim got the job.  I mean, why wouldn't he?  He's totally qualified, and smart, everyone loves him... and, if he never comes back again... that's OK.  We're friends.  And I'm sure we'll stay friends.  We just, we never got the timing right.  You know?  I shot him down, and then he did the same to me, and...  But you know what?  It's OK.  I'm totally fine.  Everything is gonna be totally--- [Jim walks in]
[on phone] Look, I'm not going to tell you that we have lower prices. Is price something that is important to you? Ok, well let me know if anything changes.
Just terrible.  And the longer you put it off, the worse it's going to get.
[changing voice] Good afternoon Iris, it's a pleasure.
I don't think you should go to Philly tonight. I think that you should stay and I think we should fight.
Michael, do not let your imagination run amok.
Dwight!  Go to my house.  Get my iPod.  I think it's on the kitchen table.  Do not touch anything else.  The key is under...
Oh my God, I win!  Ok, it was a minor league hockey game. He brought his brother, and when I went to the bathroom, the game ended and they forgot about me.
You know what? It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. [makes 'talking' gesture with her hand]  Jim, come on, we gotta get in there and practice.  Okay?  I'm not kidding!
Kelly, we're going to visit Meredith at lunch.  [Kelly's lying down on floor, head unseen under desk.  She rolls to her side, away from Pam]  Kelly?
I don���t know, but it might take me a long time to figure it out.
Now that I think about it, Angela and Andy might actually make a good couple.  But I couldn't do that to Dwight... or Angela... or Andy.
[laughs] Jim does the best impressions. Sometimes he'll look up at me from his desk and he'll just be someone else. Like he'll go um, [makes mournful face, giggles] that's supposed to be Phyllis.  I can't do it as good as he can.
If I get you a slice of pizza, are we even?
No, we um, we had plans for a third, but then I don't know, you never called me back, so...
I've decided to show her around. She really wants to meet everybody.
Sometimes we're so excited we forget where we are. Like at a business meeting.
Whoa, that's kind of condescending. Would you say something like that to Jim?
Are you okay, Kevin? [Kevin gives thumbs down]
Wow! You're shaking things up a bit, huh?
They're both single, I have a sense they might-
Oh, do you mean Darryl? That's a great idea. I'll ask him.
Okay, you do not have to do this.
I feel like [Pam look's out the window and camera pans out in The Office]--Dwight is holding a candle and reading a poem.
Here it is. [Andy is still singing] Suite 401.
At least she lived a very long and I'm sure, a very happy life. Got you this card. When you're ready. We all signed it. We just wanted you to know we're thinking about you.
So, you know it means I have to go to New York for three months...
Uh, I have to stay here and answer the phone.
[into phone] Hello, this is Pam Halpert. I���m calling from Dunder-Mifflin. Yes, your paper provider. And I just called to say... your mama is so fat, when she wears red, people yell, ���Hey, kool-aid.��� Yeah, your mama���s fat. This is Pam Halpert.
Why would I love that? Can we afford a delivery guy?
Next time we're all in this room Jim and I will be married.
We have good give and take. [vaudeville delivery] I give, he takes.
This is the last day of our summer interns. It's been nice. We haven't had interns for a while, ever since Michael's Monica Lewinsky incident. [interns are shown gathered around Kelly's desk, one holding a box of tissues, as Kelly cries and wipes tears] He didn't do anything sexual. [female intern opens a jar of salsa for Michael] He just made far, far too many Monica Lewinsky jokes. [Meredith rubs her breasts into Maurie's back] It was just easier for corporate to shut down the program.
Um, did my dad say anything about my mom?
People treat us like the race on our forehead. And then we guess what race we are.
It is totally inappropriate, but on the other hand...
Michael, this is a terrible terrible thing you've done.
I've talked to Meredith, Stanley and Jim about the chairs. I know they're with me on this.
Oh, don't get us wrong, we like picnics.
I'm sorry. It's just, uhm, I actually do have this weird feeling that there���s something Jim isn't telling me.
If you would have asked me that, then you would know.
Ok fine I���ll draw him. [hangs up phone and draws]
A little different. What time is it there?
Three hours from now or three hours from earlier like 4:00?
I think you guys all remember my mom from the wedding.
So how much antigravity potion do you want?
Yes, I'll be sure someone returns your call.  I'm so sorry.  Bye.
Which just means we get to see more of our lovely street. Tell them what we saw today Jim.
Yeah���turn signal. It's exciting to be painting again���those are the wipers. So���the���its���just. There you go! Yeah. [chuckles]  Yeah, things get so busy with the kids���red light���that it's nice to have that creative outlet���red light! Red light! Red! Red!
[to Michael who is looking at a chair catalog] Did you pick a new chair? It's been awhile.
Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. Uh... hold, please.
[talking head with Jim] We haven't told anyone I'm pregnant.
Seems like a basic reward system where you give us points, and then we redeem those points for prizes.
I really like Valentine's Day in this office. It's kinda like grade school. Everybody gives out little presents and stuff. Like last year, Jim gave me this card, with Dwight's head on it, it was horrifying and funny and...
Forget it. I'm never gonna know what goes on there.
Um, I don't know, I'm just like, I'm going a little crazy 'cause I keep overhearing all these conversations between Michael and corporate about like, staff issues?
Oh I can help starting dinner if you need it.
Well, I���m heading out to Cece���s dance recital.
Not anymore.  It's, um... It's completely over now.
Hey, put me down. Put me down. [Meredith turns and looks at Jim and Pam] Oh my god, hey, put me down. Hey...
Well, the last pick-up for overnight deliveries is at seven. So you need to have them signed by then. Or much earlier.
Hey Michael, would you get me some coffee from the warehouse?
Okay. Okay, here. Okay, so the next time he goes to the bathroom, I���ll distract him, you take that.
No. It's a jokey saying. Pobody's nerfect, like I can't even say those words right. Ha.
Sold out? That has never happened in the history of jinx.
Sure. Just one second. Please have a seat.
[placing a coke can in front of Jim] Here. [Jim looks confused] Just buy it from me. I haven't talked to you in hours and it's been weird and I really want to know what the hell's going on with Dwight. [Pam scoots the coke can towards Jim.  Jim pulls out his wallet and hands Pam a dollar.  He gives the coke back to Pam]
During the course of business, a copier goes though something called 'Normal wear and tear.'
Yeah, its nuts. But I don't know what else to do.
Ok, for the record, I am pregnant and, obviously there has been some kind of a mistake, so why doesn't Jim just pick the next highest score on the list and we'll move on.
It would've been just as easy for him to spell insect. Of course, that wouldn't have made any sense either.
No, the doctor said every five to seven minutes.
Uhh, huh, ho... oooh my God, you are ridiculous!
It's nice having Katy around. It's another person for Michael to um, interact with.
250 dollars is nothing to the world's biggest Smokey Robinson fan.
I am. You should come dance with us.
Ok, well, we're going to a bar. Hey. You have to come to stuff with me. I'm serious! If you're going to be my boyfriend, you have to do boyfriend things.
I'm kidding around.  We joke about that stuff all the time.  I'm not really the jealous type, so, I don't care if Jim sees Karen.  I care a little.
Apparently Michael has come up with a Dunder Mifflin Mad Lib, and he's making us play it with him. We are so happy. No. I'd like to choose a different adjective.
Oh no, I just, I decided to stay.
You didn't happen to bring any coffee, did you, Michael?
Hey, where have you been all night? I was looking forward to hanging out with you.
Why would you want to raise your cholesterol?
Jim had a crush on me on the booze cruise or he told you about it on the booze cruise?
Michael's got a few tricks for Valentine's Day. He found a place where you can get 12 plastic roses for $10 and he's got a great line. 'Me so thorny.'
Michael screened a work in progress for us, years ago, and it didn't go well. We thought it was a comedy. [flashback clip of Michael angrily leaving the conference room while the whole office is laughing at the tv] Everything pointed to it being a comedy.
Once a year they bring in a little cart and they give away free pretzels. It's really not a big deal. To some people it is.
I have a way to make Scranton a better place, you could leave it.  [laughter]
[enters conference room] Did you need me to take notes?
Okay, first off, my Keds. Because I couldn't have done it without them. [people clap] Thank you. Let's give Michael a round of applause for MC-ing tonight because [people start clapping again] this is a lot harder than it looks. And also because of Dwight too.
I'm sure no one asked you to do that.
I don't have any DUI's so I can drive myself, but thanks.
I saw it.  I saw it, and it was amazing!  Who said I didn't see it?  Did Jim say that I didn't see it? I saw it!
Stealing? What am I supposed to have stolen?
When it comes down to it, it's a health issue.  I should have written that.
[Nate starts walking away from hornet's nest, puts down the blowtorch] Yes!
Angela, you seem so happy. I bet you wish you were like this all the time.
I don't know! [Mose starts running by the left side of the car]
Yeah, she has a good point.  I mean, for example, with the last thing you said, by the time you explained it, it actually took up more time.
There is nothing dishonorable about talking about your life.  People like it.
I know. It's totally going to change the way I work out.
Sometimes Michael gets nostalgic and he talks about the classic gang. That's Michael, me, Jim, Dwight, Angela, Kevin, Oscar, Stanley, Phyllis, Creed, Meredith, Kelly and Ryan. We're a regular Ocean's Eleven.
Oh, I'm kind of in the middle of -- yes please.
[over indistinct conversation] Good? Yeah, he said good, I'm good...
Oh, no it's not that, I've actually been thinking that for a long time, and I'm glad I said it. I just... I'm sorry if it made you feel weird.
You do realize that we can't serve liquor at the party.
I don't often miss Roy. But I can tell you one thing. I wish someone had flashed me when I was with Roy. Because that would have been the ass-kicking of the year. [small laugh] Especially if it had been Jim. He would not have wanted me to have seen Jim's... Whoo, I am... I am saying a lot of things.
Phyllis... ended up using the exact same invitations as Roy and me. So it was kind of like being invited to my own wedding. And I was like 'Wait, thought I called that off'.
On average, how many hours a day do you spend naked in your office? Just ballpark.
My Mom is coming in to visit. And she lives like two hours away. And she doesn't have a cell phone... which is cool cause it's kind of adding some suspense to my day. And I keep looking over at the door hoping she'll walk in.
Oh, okay. It���s just that���s how Cece does it with the backwards ���E���s.
Okay.  So... you would be the Regional Manager,
Hi. [they kiss] Mmm. 'Cause-- [looks toward camera]
I don't know if there's really a private place in this office.
If we check in after midnight, I get an extra day to recuperate surrounded by doctors.
It's good. But won't it feel weird cutting into a cross?
[whispering] Um, I���m sorry. I have to go. My daughter���s a ladybug. I know that doesn���t make any sense. Um, thank you, thank you.
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh, hi Jan. He's, uh, on a sales call. No message? Bye, Jan.
Uh, I've been engaged for three years, and there's no end in sight. So... you don't wanna ask my advice.
Not that I call myself an impressionist, per se.
Aw, that's so sweet! [dart fires out of box and lodges in ceiling]
[notices Angela's intense concern] Um... let's move on. I volunteer. Did anyone have a problem with me?
Um, so, finally, I want to thank God. Because God gave me this Dundie.
[looks at to Jim] I am. [looks at Angela] It's about the Save The Date.
So you invested ten thousand dollars to look like a team player?
Oscar thinks that having a dog is just like having a baby.
[reading flavors] Despera-dough. Witchy-womanilla. Why do they do this?
Ceramics class. Then dinner by myself. I'm gonna watch HGTV and maybe go to Bungalow 8 with John Mayer.
Be careful. I pulled my mom's dog off a pillow once, and I got bit.
You had a nice meal with your girlfriend in a lovely place...
[mimicing Katy] Oh definitely, definitely step in and out of it like that.
Is it a good message or a bad message?
Well we all wanted to plan your goodbye party. We thought this would be easier.
I'm gonna need the name and cell phone number of the housekeeper responsible for changing the sheets, please.
Wow, Botticelli's, that sounds like a special occasion.
My job?  My job is to get married in the morning.  That's my job.
Cool! Here's a little 'way to go' gift from Sabre. [tosses Erin a Frisbee]
I have one idea of what it means.
I mean it's a very competitive field. But I have a professor who says I have a lot of promise, and if I don't try now, I never will. So...
So, um... we'll do it after work.  In the parking lot.  In front of everyone.  I'm going to hit you as hard as I can.
Or you proved that he thinks you're gay.
Wait, um, does anyone remember when it was set up?
Hello, Mr. Schrute, nice to see you. Please have a seat.
These are my painting clothes.I think I���m gonna do it. I am really gonna start painting the warehouse mural today. [Jim applauds]
[taking Michael's picture] Okay, a little bit more closer to the sign. Yeah.
Oh my God, what is going on, is Dwight ok?
Nellie, I could practice with you in my car at lunchtime.
You know Michael's been talking to her too.
He means his mopey place, it's under that streetlamp that he thinks was in Casablanca.
I lied it's personal. It's about me and Jim. We're... I just... you're the only person I can talk to.
That sucked. He didn't apologize. There's no talking to that guy.
She has a boyfriend. He's out of town.
Yeah, the um, the city commissioned me to do the-
I guess this is just one of those days.  It'll get better.
Yes. Yes, I desperately want to speak with you about my sex life with Jim.
Oscar, no. This is not the time for one of your principled stands.
I won't. It's just that last night is really hard for me to remember because I was just a teensy bit high. Should I have not said that?
Yeah, but aren't you supposed to do that to our... no. It's great.
I kind of thought something would happen tonight too.
Wow. Your voice is as lovely as ever.
Oh, we're not interested. We're not interested at all.
How ���bout we wait til next year after you have your kid?
I feel like I've been kinda cold to Karen and there's no real reason for it. I mean it's not like she's ever done anything to me. So, I think I probably shouldn't be cold to her.
[on voicemail, because she's calling Jim at the same time] Hi, this is Pam.  Leave a message.
[looking with Kevin at the art show flyer] Should be fun.
Darryl, oh, my gosh. How is Austin? Tell me everything. How���s the merger? I feel like I read about Athlead all the time.
[on the phone with a client] I just wanted to check and see if there's anything you needed before I went on my maternity leave...  Yeah, I'm pregnant...  Great, well, I'll write up the order.  Okay, thanks.
Do we know anyone who was in the accident?
Nothing, it's just I had to sit here all day, while Phyllis got like an entire garden delivered to her.
I almost lost it. That was too good.
Maybe it was Meredith. Maybe she brought in lice that are totally different than the lice that i got from Cece. So let's not jump to the simplest conclusion that she got her lice from me. That is how wars get started. Fine, I'll tell her it was me.
Our party is also starting now [opens door to break room.]
Roy's sister looked into it, and the application alone costs a thousand dollars.
Well I just want to take a minute to talk to you all about something very serious. Once every hour, someone is involved in an internet scam. That man is Michael Scott. [laughter] He's supporting about 20 Nigerian princesses.
Listen our credit card has been cancelled and we have to deal with that, and I really can't handle the fact that you're calling us here!
An impression, then.  Lastly, we can't help but notice that he was by himself when he died, but of course, we all know that doesn't mean he was alone.  Because I'm sure that there were lots of other birds out there who cared for him very much.  He will not be forgotten.
No no no, don't. I will go talk to Angela.
Ok. Um, a fisherman is walking down Fifth Avenue walking an animal behind him-
What's it like without my glasses?  Um, well, here, I'll show you.  Unfocus your lens.  A lot.  I'm 20/400.  You got it?  Okay, I'm gonna spend the rest of the day like this.  I can't see any of the things that would bother me on a normal day.  I can't see anything disgusting, or ugly, or Michael... it's great.
Yes, and there���s nothing you could say that would get me to run the slightest risk of losing it.
Senator Lipton helped me submit my design for a new mural on a building downtown. Now I���m just waiting to hear from the selection committee. But, you know, let���s be realistic. There are a ton of great artists in Scranton with way more experience. I mean, who are they gonna go with -- some nobody like me or a big name like Tracy Fleeb?
[giggling] Oh, wow. Funny. It's after my grandfather.
It's weird. Jan use to treat Michael like he was a ten year old, but lately it's like he's five.
Never underestimate the power of a good night's sleep.
Aw. It's OK Angela. I have mommy brain too.
The Senator? [Oscar nods] He was married before, and he has a kid.
You need to be more upset about this. She's your mother too now. Your mother is sleeping with Michael Scott.
[taking Michael's picture] Okay, uh, point at the Dunder Mifflin.
[looking up from her pilfering of Bob's food] What?
No. It was a total waste of time. Um... it was fun, though, because I got to spend the day with Andy Bernard. He's really cool.
[whispering] Angela, are you ready for the wedding?
[sighs] It���s fine. It���s just a seating arrangement. Doesn���t matter.
[looking out the window at Dwight washing the car]  Awww, he did that for me?
No, you should go for it. I mean nothing would've happened with me and Jim if he didn't put himself out there.
No.  I read in the book about nipple confusion.
You say one more word; I'm stopping the car.
It was a ghost, I told you this on, like, our first date.
You just said that we're gonna be gone...?
Michael told us to wait in here. We don't know why.
The one in the really great mesh black high-back swivel chair?
Jim does a really good one. Do yours.
Oh! Gossip, who is it? Who is it? Who is it, Michael? ...Who?
Maybe because you hated her present so much.
[with Jim, holding the baby]  She's incredible.  Want to count her fingers and toes again?
Robert doesn't talk like that. You have to stop Dwight from doing this.
I need to fit into my wedding dress. However, I'm also pregnant.
You can buy new stuff but you can't buy a new party.
You might want to trim it a little.
For what it's worth, I liked your party better.
Robert! Okay, oops! I deleted them all. They���re all deleted.
Sorry. What do I want? What do I want... Oh, it's a pencil cup.
Yeah. He said that you told him how much you love me. About how you feel when I walk in a room, and about how, you've never doubted for a second that I'm the woman you want to spend the rest of your life with. I guess he's never felt that with my mom, even at their best.
Yes. But John Stamos was temporary. I quickly moved on to-
It says ���Lotto Pool���, right on top. [points to obvious title]
It says here you cater to the eldery.
Oh, Dwight. I'm so sorry. Were you guys close?
Yes, Jim���s friend is starting anew company based on this idea Jim had when they were back in college.
Oh, Mema? She's the one in the teal suit. She's the only 80 year old with no smile wrinkles.
You shouldn't be fired. I mean, you were just protecting me.
All I did was remind her that you used to treat her badly.
No, I know, like, I kind of like, I thought that maybe you did when I first started.
Oh, all my stuff is still upstairs so...
Hey Kev, guess what. I won an art contest today.
Wait, are you saying that into the phone or are you saying that to me.
You know, I never did it, but for your 30th birthday I really wanted to surprise you with-
Michael, do you remember, you specifically told me to only bring one sheet of paper? You said it only takes one sheet to make a difference. And I said, 'Are you sure Michael?' And you said 'Pam! Pam! Pam!' And then you sneezed in my tea, and then you said, 'Don't worry, it's just allergies.' Do you remember that?
Bring her to the party. Yeah, we'll have Santa, and we'll play games with her. It'll be a lot of fun.
Hey, Michael left early, so a bunch of us are going to go to Poor Richard's for happy hour. You should come.
And Jim can jump back in without skipping a beat. We���ll come back to visit. But I think it���s time for us to officially���
No, I liked him. For a couple of days. Four years ago. [Jim nodding repeatedly] You know I have a kid with you, right?
[Pam, Ryan and Michael enter office] Sounds neat.
I'm sorry to interrupt you. Um, I actually have something very important to talk to you about, business related.
Police are a hassle. We settled this on the street.
For us, um, nothing new, really the kids are great.
Ok. I was thinking about wearing it down. Kind of like, I don't know, like loose with big curls and...
Oh! [Jim reenters bus through hatch] Hey! How'd it go?
Jada, Darryl, I'm so glad I found you guys. A grinch stole the star from on top of the Christmas tree and is hiding it in the warehouse somewhere. You want to go help me find him?
[enters on Michael alone sitting on a bed watching Glee] Michael? Maybe you should try gong in the other room again. You can have my seat. It's closer to the TV. It'll seem louder.
People are really into the costume contest this year. Might have something to do with the prize, maybe you've heard of it. The 2011 Scranton Wilkes-Barre coupon book worth over fifteen thousand dollars in savings!
You don't have to wait that long. I mean, you don't have to wait a month to ask her out. Just ask her out.
The architecture reminds one of a quaint Tuscan beet farm.
No, I got the teacher introducing them and then the applause afterwards. But not so much of the middle part.
Yeah, that's weird. I thought they only played the Police.
I don't think an apology is enough. I really think the only way for me to learn my lesson is to take my suspension.
Hmm... yeah.  Listen Michael.  Have you really thought this through?  'Cause it's a pretty big risk.
Oh. That was like crazy. 'Cause I was...
I'm gonna do it. And I fully expect to burn my feet and go to the hospital. That's the right spirit when doing a coal walk, right?
Right, and if you're interested in the way more fun party, all the info can be found here on our more brightly colored flyer. [Angela rips down brightly colored flyer and walks away. Karen rips down Angela's flyer.]
[to Phyllis] Can you tell us what happened?
Hi dad. Yeah Jim has shaving cream, check our bathroom.
Yes, I said you definitely should go, but you wanted to visit me instead.
Michael? This is the press release I was telling you about.  Ryan wants you to share it with everyone.
No... [Jim leans in for another kiss] Jim---
Dwight, what are you doing!? We've only been in here for, like, two seconds!
Okay, okay, we're not going to the hospital.  We are waiting until midnight.
Hey, Abby! Do you want to help me shred some old documents? It's actually pretty cool.
Sorry. Um, David is in Vermont. Did you speak with him? He sent Dwight instead.
There's an HR meeting in there at 11:30.
[voicemail message for Jim] I'll transfer you.  Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.  Hold, please.  Dunder Mifflin, this is ... okay, sorry.  Michael was standing at my desk, and I needed to be busy or who knows what would've happened, so thank you.
So apparently no one dresses up for Halloween here. I wish I had known that before I used greasepaint for my moustache. And I can't even take off my hat, because then I'm Hitler.
I guess you gotta move to Philly after all.
Oh my God, you guys, look. It's Recyclops.
Alright. Just don't worry, we'll figure this out.
I wonder if she'll start calling you 'Jim'.
[in car] Hey, my aunt told me something neat.
Well, that didn't have anything to do with you.
You remember you fired Roy for attacking Jim and I don't talk to him anymore really.
Hey, Erin, it's Pam. How ya doing? No, no, don't put Cece on the phone, because she can't talk yet. Okay. No, I was just calling to see how everything's going. Yeah? Yeah? It's good? The play? The play is kind of great. I mean, it's fun to hear Andy sing in the appropriate setting. Now, he's really sorry you couldn't make it, too. Yeah. So thank you so much, again. We're having a great time. Oh, they're flashing the lights so we should go in. Thanks. Bye. Okay, so we called. And everything's fine!
No, no, no, no, no.  Oh, no. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Nooooo!
Oh, um, it's just, I didn't, I didn't have a lot of time, so that's just a place holder.
I just keep getting bored. And I let things build up and build up and then I - I, I do something too big, like this. Who does this?
Tell him you'd like to go with him.
Uh, that is Creed Bratton. He has four toes and he fought in the Civil war.
No.  I don't think I can hit you in the office.
Mmm! Good pate, right? [Matt nods yes] Oscar made it. Have you met Oscar?
So, check this out. According to the handbook, you could make more money as a salesman than as a manager. They have all these incentive programs. I ran your numbers from last year.
Yeah, whatever. [Jim holds up the card] [Pam laughs] Give it to me. Give it to me.
I didn't see you! You should have yelled ���Crossing!���
Oscar and the warehouse guy! Go Oscar! Go gay warehouse guy!
I want to hit you.  I'll do that.
I know! No, I'm saying that when I feel overwhelmed, something I like to do is make a list. Make a list of things to do and then start with the easy stuff.
Hey Meredith, I need your supplier requests today.
Oh, I love Chuck Close and his photo-realist paintings. But I have to work.
Yeah. I think maybe I want a 'wedding' wedding.
What? [Jim shakes his head] Did you want to tell me something? You look like you want to tell me something. [Jim shakes his head no] You look like you have something really important to say and you just can't for some reason. [Jim smiles] Come on, you can tell me. Jim, you can tell me anything. [Jim stops smiling and looks down. Pam wonders what that means]
Right here. Little Michael Scott- [points to her belly]
I'm not - I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that.
[stands up; gets into stance] Okay wait-- it's-- you're saying it comes from the foot.
I don't know what to tell you, Jim, but I saw a ghost.
Oh no, I was confused by your phrasing.  You should definitely go out with Jim.  I mean, you're going out with Jim.  I'm not going out with Jim.  You're dating him, which is awesome, because you guys are great together.
[on phone] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh hi, David. He's having a colonoscopy. Alright, I'll find out if he's out yet.
[whispering] Hey, Jim, can I talk to you for a second?
[enters the office and has another contraction]  Oh, whoa.  Ha.  Wow.
Okay, well, my confession is that today I had a sip of coffee. But that's fine.
Ladies, are we prepared to let the Kevins of the world decide anything for us? Anything at all? We don't even give him full internet access.
When did you find time to do all this?
You just have to go in there. You have to hear it from her.
Don���t you guys have everything. I mean, its just a paper company.
And we know how he died.  Flying into the glass doors.  But you know what?  I don't think he was being stupid.  I think he just really, really wanted to come inside our building to spread his cheer and lift our spirits with a song.
Here, uh... Meredith? Why don't you put your hazards on.
OK. [to Darryl] Do you know the plate... never mind. Why would you know that? And why would I be asking that?
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Sure, can I ask who's calling? Just a second.
[opens up her present] Oh, my god! Thank you very much, Santa, whoever you are. It's awesome.
Okay, well I have the tablecloth, don't forget the flatware.
I don't think any of them are supposed to shred magazines.
OK. I'm gonna be a few minutes. So it's only twenty past five. I still have to do my faxes.
Well, of course not, but does physical appearance include smell?
Ok. I, just, when you are done or any time it's convent, I just thought since you are out...
[laughs] Yeah, and uh, you basically learn how an office runs.
I haven���t told anyone here about the mural yet. I want Jim to be the first to know. Whenever I tell him good news, he���s always like, ���Beesly!��� I love that. Only thing better than getting the job-- ���Beesly!��� [chuckles]
Actually, people are really unhappy. Um, Dwight sent around this memo and people are freaking out 'cause the...
Oh... come on, bear man. Come on. [the lights flicker]
There is no rush to get to the hospital.  I am fine.  I'll get there.  And if I don't get there, I don't get there.
OK. If I have to do this, based on stereotypes that are totally untrue, that I do not agree with, you would maybe not be  a very good driver.
Like, he used to make dogs fight? Or he actually fought dogs?
Yes.  And I think they gave him too many fries.
After you talked, he called my mom and said he was gonna look for an apartment.
It all started when Dwight was tapping his foot against the leg of his desk. When I asked him to stop, he said, 'I will when you lose the baby weight.'
My personal favorite is the one he made for his condo association.
What's that come to? Like, what did they each win?
No, I mean he's sulking. That's not like him.
I'm having contractions, but they're irregular and far apart.  So I'm not really in labor, I'm near labor.
[to Cece] Hm. Don't listen to her. She's just jealous 'cause she doesn't get to come home to someone as cute as you.
Maybe Michael has a point. I mean, if she was really that upset, she wouldn't still be here.
Okay, it's not regulation size, but it'll do. You have to practice. You have to get real good and beat Darryl.
[everyone cheers as Meredith spins and lands on ���tiny wheel���] The tiny wheel actually does have chores. It���s so cute no one seems to mind.
So what are you going to get me instead?
Well, I can't really imagine you yelling at anyone.
Jim is a great guy. He's like a brother to me.  We're like best friends in the office and I really hope he finds someone.
I can't believe this. I mean I have never even stolen as much as a paperclip and you're firing me.
Oh, yeah, we were. We were just looking to say hi. So hey.
Nope, that's Dr. Laura. Well, her show Biz Whiz wants someone from Dunder Mifflin to come on the air today. Does anybody feel particularly passionate about local business issues? [Dwight raises hand]
And there are a lot of other people in this office who have money at stake. Other people you care about.
I'm still not sure why this woman is even here.
In Phoenix. They should really tell you that more specifically. I mean, every game is an away game for one of the teams. [long pause] Do we know everything about each other?
Yes. But there's, wait, oh, there's a funny ending to that story. I can't remember.
Wait, that's it? That's the question you're going to ask him?
What? You have something you want to say?
We don't have any money. We don't have an office. We don't have anything.
[Pam and Jim hear Dwight crying] Ugh, your turn.
No, not like a ham. It's about doing something, so that the person knows that you really care about her.
Just don't talk about the email, okay? He's gonna cancel it on his own, I really think he will.
The thing I like most about Recyclops is that he's creating a different world for our child.
Okay, you guys, have fun. You too, Andy.
Todd, you're just saying insults in the form of an apology.
Today is my first day at my new job at Michael Scott Paper Company Incorporated. You know, Apple Computers started in a garage. And we're starting in a condo. So we already have a leg up on Apple. [picks up piece of mail] Look, it's official! [door opens, Michael is in a bath robe]
It's funny you bring that up because yes it is.
[Pam sees Mose in an outhouse] Oh my God. What century is this?
Okay. I lost my engagement ring in ceramics class. Left it in my smock. I had this whole thing where I go back to class, wrongly accuse another girl. Look I even used makeup to put a ring around my finger, you can hardly see it, it's very subtle.
Okay great.  [Isabel kisses her cheek] Yeah, I'll see you in a second.  [pauses] Wait, what? [tries to follow, but veil gets caught on wall and tears] Oh! Oh no!
Well, my dad can't hear a thing. You could boom his whole life for him.
I know, but I can't cover reception. I have a ton of work to do.
Jim, what if we both lose our jobs?  I'm trying to think of a way that this all ends up fine, and I can't think of one.
49 again? That's nine years in a row.  This is now our longest family tradition.
[to cameraman] What? [looks at Dwight eating a Baby Ruth] Ohhhh... Yes!  Thank you!
Oh, great. Oh, I���m sorry. Do you mind telling me her name? I realized we don���t have it.
I wish we'd started this exercise six months ago. My heart just feels so... blocked up.
They���re the ones who put a fish tank next to a basketball hoop. It���s like if I put a glass of milk on the edge of the table and Cece knocks it over, I don���t blame Cece.
Is this because Jim walked in on you going to the bathroom?
Toby, was this your fun little way of congratulating us?
You can tell Michael that I'm not leaving.
Um, Karen left her blindfold on the longest but she also threw her egg at Jim.
Maybe it's because you spent the whole year flirting with the receptionist.
Remember, you were gonna get a new chair, and you were gonna give your old chair to me. Remember that?
Nobody's going to prison, okay? Um... all right, Michael, you need to convince Jo to go easy on us. And then we'll all confess once we know our jobs are safe.
I'm just gonna sit here for a little bit longer if that's okay. The air smells so good. I don't remember it smelling so good. The chairs are so comfortable.
I spent a month putting that rolodex on his Blackberry, which he now uses as a nightlight.
So you have an office and a workspace?
Because they have a great design program, and I wanted to see if I was any good at it. And I wanted to work on my art, too.
Oh, can I help? We could say someone is related to, uhm, Tonya Harding.
Is it... is it pebbles from that beach in Jamaica? [she shakes it]
We couldn't do it without you, so we postponed.
[Michael knocks on Pam's desk] Yeah? [Michael points at Pam, himself, and Meredith, mimes drinking, driving, then points to his watch and holds up five fingers] I weirdly know exactly what you're saying to me.
You know, she also said the waiting list is like eight months.
[to Michael] You're gonna wanna look at the date on that.  Oh, wow. Look at... golfing. [to Donna] Are you a golfer?
You know, I think there could be a lot of benefits if you could learn to get along with women.
Brake lights. Break lights! Break lights! Break lights!!!
Jim and I are pretty sure she had an affair with her ex-assistant Hunter. He was 17. But she looks great. If she asks, will you tell her I said that?
Well, it doesn���t spin. We���ll just move the wheel one notch each morning and��� you see what chore you get that day.
[asks Nellie who is tapping a pen on her desk]. Is everything okay?
I think we should get a townhouse in SoHo...
That's OK. I don't feel like answering phones.
Maybe sort of ahead of his time as a writer.
[to Jim] Why don't you talk to him about it?
Dwight, I don't think he's going to hurt anybody.
We wrote a good review.  Under comments, we wrote, the natural aroma of the beets drifts into the bedroom and makes you dream of simpler times.
New York, as it turns out, is very expensive, and I ran out of money. I thought about selling a kidney, but Michael offered to get me a part-time job at corporate.
I dunno. I mean, maybe he'll talk to you about some of this stuff 'cause he can't really talk to me about it.
Umm. How many different ways are there to sniffle?
Kevin, at most you���re saving a microscopic amount of time.
It's fine.  Erin, you're going to go.  And you're going to make sure Michael tells the truth.
Oh, thank God.  I haven't had caffeine in nine months.
Well I don't think you're gonna be very happy with this.
Coming to Scranton. Is anyone coming to Scranton?
Roy's my fiance. We've been engaged about three years. We were supposed to get married in September but I think we're gonna get married in the spring.
Uh, just off the top... I think she'll be here this afternoon.
You could have just told us what you were thinking.
Remember yesterday when we were terrified of being parents?
Well, you know... they don't call me the Bart Simpson of Scranton for nothing.
I'm not apologizing to anyone.  Michael owes me an apology.
I have doubts about this too. But when one person freaks out, sometimes it weirdly makes the other one calmer. That's one thing I've learned about relationships. I hate that I just used the word relationship. [Michael comes out in a suit] Hey! You look great! [checks something off her list] Let's go!
[gasps] Yes! Cece wanted to thank everybody for letting her daddy stay home with her all last week and play, so she brought you a little treat.
I love you, but I'm kinda busy. So I need you to figure this one out on your own.
It���s going to be good to have someone hot at Pam���s desk huh?
I just, uh, thought you'd want to know that.
Cool, are you coming back to say hi?
I think she looks good. Now that she���s wearing sports bras, we don���t see her boobs as much.
Oh, Jim I should have told you I didn't get the job.
I was, and then they switched to Acrobat just as I was learning Quark.  I hate computers.
But instead, you found something to distract you from ever picking out a chair.
Dwight, you may find this hard to believe, but I love my boring life.
Hey, Michael, why don't you just get down.
Um... I just wanted to say that... Just, my Mom's coming in today.
I use to love coming here.  The chicken parm is good.  Big part of my childhood.  Oh, maybe Michael will start dating that too.
Something's up with Jim and Karen.  Not that I've been eavesdropping.  It's not really any of my business, but I've gotten pretty good at reading the back of Jim's neck.
Michael Scott's Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton, Meredith Palmer memorial, celebrity rabies awareness, fun run race for the cure, this is Pam.
This is where I used to keep my computer.
So, I guess that's how they're gonna play this. It is on. [very serious] It is so on.
I���ve been through several rounds of development with the team and here���s where we stand with the chore wheel. [introducing a third ���chore wheel���, excited] We���ve got prizes! Ten bucks, candy bar, manager for an hour but, there are also penalties. Like, no internet, Stanley gets your lunch. The one thing that is not on the chore wheel is chores. But they were right; it���s more fun this way.
Maybe, because it doesn't seem to be going super well.
Yeah, yeah, no, no. It���s a good idea to brush your teeth. But you have to um, feed your children. Send them to school. You know, all things you can���t do if you just keep singing ���Monster Mash.���
Ok, but listen. We just don't have the budget for it. Okay? Reception needed a computer so we got one.
Well, if it makes you feel better, I didn't get one either.
If I could get her sleeping normally I could get my life back.
Well, ya know, Michael is a great delegator. He never does any work himself. Ever. And one time, I walked in on him naked, and his thing is so small. [quickly walks off stage] If it were an iPod it would be a shuffle! [clapping, laughter]
I don't know, I kind of hate all our regular places right now. Oh, you know what [Jim gets down on one knee], that one...
No, you should have her mom do the boring Christmas stuff on her time. You should be associated with the fun parts of Christmas.
He said if it takes off he���s gonna buy us a new car.
Hide, they���re giving out jobs upstairs. Why don���t you go up and get one?
Say they don���t hire you. It���s not like you���re out on the street. You have a great job with people who love you.
Michael, you have to put your hands down.
Yeah, I get all the memos. [starts to leave]
[voicemail message for Jim] Hey, Jim.  It's Pam.  I keep looking up to say something to you and then Michael's there and it's horrible.  Anyway, I'm bored.  Come back!
Maybe. I just ...I don't really have anyone to go with.
Don't act like you understood anything that guy said. [pat's Jim's arm] Good luck, wingman. [salutes]
Or have them sing that song! That the frog does in Looney Tunes.
Oh, my God.  His letter of recommendation from Rick Santorum is three fifty-dollar bills.
Just like no big reason. Just a bunch of little reasons.
I'm coming back the wrong way.  [smiles at Jim across the parking lot] It's not because of you.  I don't like graphic design. That's it. [laughs] Stop smiling. I really didn't like it.  It's just designing logos and stuff.... and I miss Scranton.  But it is not because I missed you. I just really wanted to come home... and I know you said to come home the right way, but you can't tell me what to do. Got it?
Now the bronze are really blue, and they're also the back side of the gold, so no flipping. K? Honor system.
[accent] It wasn't me.  I'm not goin' down for this!
Somebody defaced the billboards we just put out in an inappropriate way.
But I'm not kidding.  I really want to do it.
Okay, so, when you���re selling to this woman, just imagine that she���s that nice, reasonable barber.
Yeah.  Don't fall asleep at your desk.  [Turning towards the vending machine] Oh my God.
Yes, I found it in a shelf in the corner of the warehouse. [Darryl gives the camera an odd look]
I just feel kind of tired, you know.
[to Jim] I'm sorry, I'm leaving you alone for lunch.
I don't think we really need that, Michael.
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh hi ,David. [Michael shakes his head to Pam] No, I'm sorry he's not back from the Civil Rights rally. I'll have him call you the minute he gets back from the Lincoln Memorial.
Well, I feel like she needs to eat, but she won't latch on, which is weird, because the other baby di...
I actually might not go. Feeling kind of tired.
I was just wondering, what kind of jobs do you guys have?
So Sarah Kaya says to Eric, 'No way.  You can't reserve seats.' And Stacy gets all up in her face and Sarah Kaya picks up Stacy's new PM pad and throws it at the light box.
I'm serious. Um, I'm really glad I came.
I know Jan didn't poison the food. I know that. But if she was going to poison the food of someone at that table wouldn't it be me? Michael's former lover?
You know what? It's fine, it's fine. Let me just...it's fine. [Pam leaves work bus]
And, poof! He disappears. [Jim snaps, playing along]
[on phone] Cici has been calling me 'Pamela'. Like four times this week.
Well, we won���t be late. I love you, mom. Thanks.
Back off, Dwight. [serves] Hyuh! [the opposing team misses the ball, the Scranton team cheers] What?
I can't do this. I don't have this sales gene, or whatever it is. Tell me everything is going to be ok.
Michael, Dwight's looking at gay pornography on his computer.
[to everyone in conference room] I have terrible news. Someone defaced my mural. They painted all over it.
Hey guys, we're all gonna visit Meredith at lunch. And we're kicking in $5 for flowers.
Great. I am killing it over here. [drops mayonnaise on the ground] Jim, I gotta go.
[to Jim] Shush. [to Kevin] Kevin, a playful touch on the arm, or on the back, it can show your interest and it's really romantic.
Yup! [Tom and Pete give Halpertian looks to camera]
[Pam and Oscar are trying to repack cardboard box] Yep, yep.
I could work here. I could see this.
Actually, it's kind of too bad we're not coming into work tomorrow.
Yeah.  Maybe you shouldn't fake fire people anymore.
I can't. I'm really sorry if you misinterpreted things. It's probably my fault.
Don't get on it. [Michael inches toward elevator]
There's a finger-painting station and a curly slide. Am I too old to go here?
Hey, I���m the one who has to sit next to this weirdo when Jim���s away. I���m in a position where I���m rooting for Nate, and that just feels wrong. [sighs] Forget it.  I need to work on my mural. I have some pointy trees that I need to round off.
You put in the garbage can that was a special filing cabinet.
He's really making you work for it, huh?
After I had my little outburst at the beach, Jim was really nice about it. He just basically said that he missed my friendship too and I would always mean a lot to him and I understand where he's coming from.  For the record, I am not embarassed at all. It needed to be said, and I said it, and it only took me three years to summons the courage, so [quietly, and mock bowing] thank you.
Whatever, you know, sleep with my mom, sleep with everybody's mom...
Well, since we're stopped at a light, uhhh, here is...the mural I did for Angela's baby.
You're gonna give yourself a bonus of $645 instead of getting the entire office something it really needs?
I think we broke his brain. [they both snicker]
[voicemail message for Jim] Calling from my cell phone.  I don't know if you guys figured out who did that to Michael's carpet yet, but I have a theory that involves an inter-departmental conspiracy.  Everybody in the office.  We need to talk.
Well, I didn't think that butt was funny.
Read article nineteen. There are suitable standards that you have to maintain the building at that includes comfortable temperatures and adequate lighting. It also means no more cutting the tampons in two, and no more tampering with the toilet paper.
No, he's actually been really nice and helpful.
It's a good shredder, it just keeps breaking.
You just... You look good. Your shirt looks... You look real good.
[to Michael on speakerphone] Ok, you want me to read 'em?
I told you, I have the number that rings here. Do you want that number?
You know what?  I really think the whole thing is just gonna blow over in like a week or two.
So, Melissa... I met your mom a couple times. She's
I don't know. I try not to bother him about this kind of stuff.
This is our first joint sales pitch. I think we're gonna work really well together.
I feel horrible for blowing Jim's prank. I don't know if you can tell, but he's mildly upset. And Dwight hasn't been messed with in a while, so he's become a monster. I need to make this right.
Then why isn't he scheming? Or preparing to avenge?
You have any big Valentine's Day plans, Kev?
Actually, the distractions are good.  I mean, I don't think I'm going to make it until midnight if I'm just sitting here thinking about it.
[laughs] No. The Odd Life of Timothy Green.
Nope. 'Cause we're really nice people but you don't seem to like us.
Not almost, though, Holly. I mean, not -- not close to 200...
Okay. Put everything back exactly how you found it.
What are the odds that this is in any way real?
Great. Uh, except, I don't want to be a receptionist anymore.
[on phone] No, he hasn't picked one yet.
Oh.  I think you should get it.  You've changed a lot and you'd be good at it.
Look, seriously, I can move it fine. Come on, let's go, it's our ball. Let's go!
Great! I thought you could use this time to authorize some checks.
Fair enough. Um... I don't think you're a very good person. And forgive me, but I feel like I've said this to you before: I don't like you very much.
I am-- I am-- I am trying to make everything perfect here, okay? So that you can have everything that you want.
Oh, I can't do lunch. I was just sending you an email. Jim and I need to leave early today to meet with our contractor.
Oh, oh my gosh. Yes, but don't, don't say anything, okay? It's after my grandfather.
It's cold Dwight. Just shut the door and let people come in the front.
I know, because you're the reason we're moving.
They have new phone systems now that can ring directly to a salesman, or someone presses star and they go to accounting, basically 95% of my job.  But I'd like to see a machine that puts out candy for everyone. [realizing] Vending machine.
I don't know if I'm gonna make any money with art.
Do you like it? It's a photo of everyone in the office. So you can take it to Costa Rica.
Angela - she used to stay here sometimes?
Okay, that's a lot of good ideas. Thanks
I just wanted to get out of my room for a little while.
Nice. So, should I reschedule the rematch with Darryl now?
Well I'm having my baby first, so that's that.
[laughs] Oh boy. Oh no, I���m not laughing at you. I���m laughing at, um, something that Cece did on the playground earlier -- yesterday. This morning.
Yeah. Oh, you should come to my art show, by the way.
And then, out of that cake, pops another stripper holding a smaller cake. And then an even smaller stripper pops out of that one.
Do you think that you could send in your RSVP card?
Oh, some guy exposed himself to Phyllis in the parking lot.
Do I at least get to go with you in this fantasy?
I literally cannot wait to see what Dwight has planned.  And I wish Jim were here.
Thanks! Yeah, so I'm just going to take care of things around the office and get paid a reasonable salary. You believe that, right?
That is right. Don't make any more of it.
[imitating Deangelo's pretend juggling routine] Look.  I'm juggling eggs and bowling balls.  I'm juggling with one hand.  No hands.
She's coming in today and maybe just don't joke around about that stuff in front of her.
Is it funny? I thought it was more ...interesting, than funny. [she walks over to see Oscar at the window looking down on man catching a football in parking lot]  I think my water just broke!
We have maybe a month.  I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Um, hey, Darryl, listen, it's none of my business, but if I couldn't have Cece for Christmas, I'd be really upset too.
No, no, no, 'Tracks of My Tears' and what else? What are some more? What's one more?
Or I could come back as your personal assistant. You know? Sort your mail, set your appointments. I know all the people.
You know, Angela, you don't have to come to the wedding.
Hey, Dwight. Jim and I found your wallet in the parking lot.
[pointing to Jim's bluetooth headset] What's that? Is that a-
Oh, don't worry about it. I mean, it's better than listening to Michael play a conch shell... which is what I was doing. Oh, also, Michael went to Jamaica with Jan!
[laughs] No, I was just checking out my present. [holds up teapot]
Hey, I was thinking about dinner--- [Jim grabs her face and kisses her]
Maybe it���s a list of people he���s gonna fire.
I can't get a fire pit. I have two babies.
Mema's not coming to the wedding. She's leaving tomorrow morning.
Yay Kevin. Whoo hoo for Kevin! For stinking up the bathroom.
Honestly, I think you should go easy on her.
Try paperclips. Oh wait. This message. For Dwight.
I went on a date. It wasn't a love connection, um... I think when I like someone again, I'll just kinda know.
Oh look, they're starting. [all watch fireworks display; scattered applause and cheers; Darryl's band plays soft music]
It's actually based on a book called Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.
And that's what you said about Art School, and that's what you said about sales.
Nope. Scared of getting cut in half. Also, there's pee on the floor.
You know, maybe we should just have our own pregnancies and not pretend like we���re in this together.
Everyone, can I have your attention.  This is the moment you've all been waiting for. Right? [drum roll on copier]
Ok, well it wasn't obvious so... [phone hangs up]
Uh, to speak my truth, I'd appreciate if you hung that up cause we were in the middle of a conversation. [Jim hangs up phone] I appreciate the sacrifice.
Hey, guys! Fun thing. The index cards on your desk are resolution cards. You write your New Year's resolution on them, I'll collect them, and then display them on... da-da-da-da-da! This! Resolution board.
Oh, no we're actually married. We're not brother and sister.
OK. What does he like? What's important to him? Does he have like a favorite pair of boots or a lunch box or...
Yeah. Painting now. I just want to make sure that...
Okay, Phyllis sits across from him every day. Phyllis, does he have a moustache or not?
[on the phone] Hey, hey! Where are you?  Can you take Andy to the hospital?
If you���re an artist, you have to be okay with the idea ��that you can���t please everybody all the time.
What can I do for you, Michael? I'm kinda busy.
No, but that would've been a really good idea.
Yeah. Yeah, I mean I could have used another week, or three.
[on phone with Jim] He said, 'I did like Dwight'? He's gonna fire him.
You know, like aren't some things just so nice and cozy in the rain?
Good. Doesn't sound pushy...you're just stating a fact.
You're not the least bit curious to hear a poem straight from Ryan's soul?
Man, Angela really had a hold on him. [Dwight playing the recorder in the background]  Angela.
Cece, is reverse cycling, which means she sleeps all day and is up all night. Which basically means I'm up all day and I'm up all night. And if it doesn't stop soon, I am going to be up all night.
I know.  Isn't that always how it goes?
We can't let him buy our forgiveness with cupcakes. He was awful to us. And, he still is. How much is a cupcake? $2.50? Is that the price of our dignity?
No, it's not that. Um, I was just wondering, since I'm probably going to have to stay late, could you ask Dwight to stay late too so he can walk me to my car?
Oh good, I'm just in time for Ping.
[reading from paper] Can you make that straighter? That job looks hard. You should put your mouth on that. How can you even use that one naturally?
It's impractical. I'm not going to try to get a house like that. Um... they don't even make houses like that in Scranton. So, I'm never going to... .
[lifting up a diamond bracelet] Oh, my God.
Weird to see how we used to look in those promos. Some of us have changed so much.
Well, you should cover it with the broccoli.
I love it, conservation.  Let's start by conserving our time and stop having these stupid meetings.   [stands up and cheers]  No more meetings!  No more meetings! No more meetings!  No more meetings!  [Stanley cheers her on in the background]
Oh God no, Dwight isn't my friend... Oh my God!  Dwight's kind of my friend!
Yeah, enjoy this moment, because you're never going to go back to this time before you met your desk mate Dwight.
Why don't you just tell him how his actions are being perceived by the women in this office?
Mmm-mm.  I'm probably just gonna stay here for a while, say I got lost.
He is in my room icing his balls.
Hey, Toby. [walks past him to Kelly's cubicle]
Okay. [picks up and reads sheet]  The Michael Scott Foundation is still in existence?
Do you want me to ask the cleaning crew if they stopped watering it?
Kelly made me realize something.  She and I have... nothing in common.  And I need more friends.
They say if you're nervous around someone you should picture them naked. I do not recommend this strategy. Try picturing them with more clothes on... or a funny coat.
I'm confused. Am I walking down the aisle to 'You Can Call Me Al?'
We were wondering if you would like to have dinner with us tonight, in our home, and play with our baby.
But have you ever actually seen him yourself?
No, no. Jim had a great year, actually. I just wanted to get your opinion.
Yeah, okay, I���m sorry. I���m sure we can get a copy. A lot of people were taping it.
Mm-hmm.  Yes, I'm fine.  Um, yeah, the doctor said it's still considered a minor contraction as long as I can talk through it.
No, we settled in a much more rational place, remember?
I mean, I don't know. So... what's it like dating a cheerleader?
Oh, I just get those at any party supply place.
[looks at beers] Oh. [Starts to walk away, turns around] No. Actually, one of these is supposed to be a lite.
[referencing the ���tiny wheel���] Toilets! [everyone cheers as Meredith accepts her chore]
I meant to say something earlier. I just...
Nellie, why don���t you  tell Dwight what we were doing earlier today. And Dwight, you show us that you���re listening.
Everyone, Let���s take our picture in front of the mural. Oh, um, I just���I kind of meant just everybody from the office.
[serves] Hyuh! [other team misses and Scranton cheers] Well, look at that, we win!
Oh, hey, don't fill up on chocolates. I made us a lunch reservation at State Street Grill.
Please hug and kiss me, no matter how hard I struggle.  I'm too shy to tell you that I love you.'
My husband would tell you to go for it.
[on phone]: Did you send Dwight on a quest for the Holy Grail?
Oh ok, but in order for us to make it, there can't be any secrets between us.
You talked to the man whose wife you're having an affair with.
Who cares? [Michael peeking at them through his office window] It's not that huge a sale.
You know the baby's not going to live here, right?
Kelly really likes to online shop.  Soooo, I felt like I wanted some new clothes.  I mean, I just, I wanted to, it just, I felt like it was time, to maybe um... just get new clothes.
I was in the meeting with Jan and she did say that it could be this branch that gets the axe.
Next on the list - open the mail.
We should get him a bus ticket. [types on computer] To make his trip easier.
It's nice. It's funny. It mentions his tonsillectomy and makes a funny little joke about his moustache.
Michael sends me a postcard from every vacation he goes on. Atlantic City, he wishes I was here. Busch Gardens, Virginia, all I got was this lousy postcard. And this time, I'm Jamaican-him-crazy. I don't know how far away he thought he was, because he put $10 worth of stamps on this.
Yeah, if I could have seen what he just did, I think I would have gotten angry.
Because she's conflicted.  She has to be professional, but she's fighting feelings... for you.
Hey, everybody. Um, I decided to eat my cupcake. I thought about it last night. I talked to Jim. I talked to my sister. And, I think that, as long as Todd Packer doesn't know, it's OK.
Ok. All of these things are important to remember but the most important thing is no one say anything about my pregnancy at the wedding.
[looks up] Why aren't you as mad or interested in this as me?
Thank you. [takes bite] Oh my gosh. It's really good.
Yes. You guys, I have the perfect idea. Ok, it will just take me ten minutes.
This is a ridiculously awful plan. Because you cut everything.
Well, I mean, the only reason he doesn't is because I'm breastfeeding, and Phillip doesn't like a bottle.
[telephone ringing] This is Pam. Oh my God, are you sure? Uh, okay. Okay, um, we���ll be right there. Everybody, the balloon is falling.
What do we know about this bird?  You might think, 'Not much.  It's just a bird.'  But we do know some things.  We know it was a local bird.  Maybe it's that same bird that surprised Oscar that one morning with a special present from above.
I know. It's just even if it was, a great boss and a great job, I just, I don't know, I don't know if I want, um, I don't know if I want this.
[Pam nods head] You should say hi. Use her full name.
[in New York, humming to herself to the tune of 'Centerfold'] Na na na na na. Na na na na na na na.
So how do you come up with your cartoons?
Oh, okay. Okay, I will. [hangs up phone]
This is our first and only Valentine's Day as fiances.
Have you heard anything about any secret office romances?
It's kind of like that lip thing she did last night, like a half snarl, half smile? I get the sense that she's very ironic.
The shipping place closes in a half hour.
Well, she can't bring this up with her.
[to Roy in Jim's earshot] ...back so soon.
Well I know how it is. I know it's a lot of fun. I don't know how it is. Andy, this is a lame job. What are you doing here?
So, uh, biggest thing, besides not being able to get her to latch...
No, no, it's not a big deal, please. No. Um, Meredith can I get you something special while I'm at the store, candy, or...or one of those stylish turbans?
[looks at list] When did you add this to the list?
[on her cell phone] Hey where are you? Yeah, we were supposed to meet here. What? Oh my gosh! That ties in perfectly with something that Michael was telling me earlier! I just don't know what some of the people in, like, accounting are going to do? It said specifically that...
No, not... we're not... we're not having problems. But it is personal. And I would love...
We'll find another receptionist. I mean, that's easy. We'll be fine. [Andy nods reluctantly]
Alright, let's give her a break. We don't know for sure this is Meredith's fault.
Jim. Jim, Jim, Jim. I'm not threatening you. I love you. [whispers] But you should know, you're on very dangerous ground [kisses Jim]. [at normal volume] All right.
So Jim and I are getting married and the wedding's really expensive.  So I tried to get a job on the weekends to earn extra money.  I applied to Old Navy, Target and Wal-mart.  None of 'em called me back.  Not even for an interview.
Michael, there's a Charles Miner here to see you.
And he wanted Jim to be a part of it too.
So we're planning this party for Nellie, and we're gonna make it really bad.
Ladies and gentlemen, I think we have a winner.
About when you want to give me more of your money?
Hey Jim. Stanley's back from the hospital today. Can you sign his card?
In his office. You can go right in.
Jim doesn't let me wash his NFL jersey during the playoffs. How is this any less logical?
Parenting? Yeah. This is Cici���s favorite magazine. She loves the pictures of babies.
One of the simplest ways to cut down on the spread of germs is to use something called the vampire cough.
Phyllis has gotten into audio books and lately she's been listening to 50 Shades of Grey.  Which, if you don't know what it is, it's a book about um...
Yes, it is The Island Luau Inventory '07. It's actually a success compared to Disco Audit '05.
Here's the story. That guy in there is Jim's childhood friend, Tom.
I don't know what to do! Do I go tell Jo, or - I don't want everyone to keep blaming the wrong person!
This is Michael, my boss. [she points] Justin.
I don���t know, Jim -- maybe you should have been there.
So I'm going to Carbondale this afternoon to get a new bulk shredder.
[on the phone] You can fax it over. Yeah, 5-7-0-5-5-5-0-1--
[clink of beer bottles] Beers? You closed it?
Somebody did something bad to Michael's carpet. Maybe that's all we need to know.
Um... but hey? Something kind of cool. There's this internship in graphic design that Jan was telling us about. She made it sound, like, really great.
Why do you always think that girls are gonna be at the party? No one invited girls. It's just us.
[puts hand up for high five] Same religion.
[shocked after seeing the torn up carpet] Hey��� What happened here?
Do you guys want some food? The wings are really good here.
Okay. [Jim and Pam hug] Good luck. You're gonna be great.
I'm saving that 'cause I like it when the cards go T-ts-ts-tch-tch-tch.
[sighs] Everyone's driving me crazy.  I know way too much about Andy's scrotum.  [Jim chuckles] And my mom won't stop freaking out about my dad's new girlfriend.  [sighs] This is supposed to be our wedding day.  Why did we invite all these people?
The ones for drivers to check their blind spots?
Because the thing you're saying I'm good at, is pushing a big green button a bunch of times.
Mose, Angela hasn't been around here much lately, has she?
Before we kick off the party, I just want to remind everyone that an office party is just that...
[gesturing to Michael dancing in his office] He looks happy.
Pretty crazy about Andy and Michelle Obama, huh?
Mo Chuisle. He's watching Million Dollar Baby... He's gonna try to kill me.
I know.  And how long is CJ gonna spin this whole MS thing?  How can Josh and Sam keep quiet?
Oh you have to Jim? You literally have to?
And you kind of torpedo every romantic relationship you're in.
I know you Michael, I saw you naked.
Oh, I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
How come out of everyone in the office, I'm the only one that went with you? Is it because I'm that stupid? I mean, your own grandmother doesn't even believe in you!
I kind of forced you to do it.
[at school in NYC] Can't believe this. [pulls out cell phone... sighs]
The thing about pregnancy is people treat you differently. Like you're a kid almost. They lose all sense of boundaries. They start acting weird, telling you things that clearly aren't true. I know it sounds nuts, but I think Dwight is the only one who's telling me the truth.
It's not too bad. I get to shred things sometimes, do you want to see?
Katy and Jim met in the office. And now I guess they're like going out, or dating, or something. And, uh... I don't know! You know? They're just... She calls him, and they... You know, I'm sorry. I feel like I'm talking really loud. Am I talking really loud?
Ravi, our amazing pediatrician, was asking us if we knew any girls and I said I know the perfect girl.
I have this kind of big secret about Angela. And I've been really nice to her... and I haven't told anyone. And what the hell?!
Well the first one has a surprise factor. 'I'm a suck suck-suckidy Sabre!'
Yes, but David Wallace does. And he asked me to gather everyone to talk about stuff... That's gonna be revealed once we're in the conference room for the meeting.
Jim, what are you doing?  Get in there.  This is not the time to take a stand.  At least he likes one of us.
Well, I am a few months ahead of you.
Yeah, I needed to take care of some stuff.
Is there-- um... you want to ease up a little bit?
Jim, I don't want the first thing the baby hears to be the 8 Mile soundtrack.
No, no, it's fine. Just gimme a second.
Yes.  She was a little fussy earlier, but she's totally quieted down.  Here, let me just, uh, let me just burp her.  I don't want her to spit up on you.  Come here, sweety...  Oh, my God!  Wrong baby!
Seriously? Because it sounds like one of those is better than the other.
...I feel like we should go get Kevin something. Do you think we can sneak out of here?
I don't know, I didn't read it carefully, I just saw 'congratulations' and I skimmed the list, I saw my name, I came in here to tell you and get a snack.
Not really. It's kinda weird that a grown man is singing from the point of view of a little girl.
[looking at Cece's diaper] Somebody needs a change.
Oh, my God. What are we gonna do?
Does that mean an idea that blows up in our faces later? [Pam's phone rings]
[breathes deeply and runs across coals] Oooh, uh hah, ooh! Wha-hoo! Ahhhh...
I'm saying we should go scorched earth on that guy's face.
Last week Jim wasn���t there, and they named the company Athlead.
I may have a few weeks ago faked a call from Jan in order to get out of a synopsis of, I think it was, Navy: NCIS. Since then, Michael's been suspicious.
Oh, I can not believe I fell for that. [laughing] Oh, my God.
Yeah, that's right.  We could do a three-day weekend.  I wonder if I could, like, call in sick on the Friday.  Then I get a four-day weekend.
Hey Angela, you wanna see a picture of Phillip wearing those little booties you got us?
I mean, who knows? Maybe I have a niece my family never told me about.
Hey! Our baby was not a mistake. She was a surprise.
Australia? I have always wanted to go there?
Because she's not a sex model.  She's a tollbooth operator.
Well, that���s funny because I think of him as working part time in Philadelphia.
Really? I've been putting the kids to bed by myself every night for a months. And you had to miss one phone call. Is that your truth, Jim? That's really your truth?
Dwight, that was really nice. You should ask for her number.
Oh! I... uh... yeah. Um... I'll uh show them to you later.
But the warehouse coffee tastes SO much better.
Yes, I have a date. He's a cartoonist for the local paper, which is really neat, because I like to draw too. I'm kind of nervous. I haven't been on a first date in nine years... probably shouldn't broadcast that.
Yeah, I mean, admitting you need help is the first step!
I'm looking forward to 'Take Your Daughter to Work' day. I am not great with kids, but I wanna get better. Because I'm getting married. So, I put out a bunch of extra candy out on my desk so the kids will come talk to me. ...Like the witch in Hanzel and Gretel.
Much different the second time around. And I have to say; it is nice not being the only pregnant woman in the office.
I'd remember talking about Jim. That wasn't it.
And spend time with George Emerson.  That's what I would do.  I mean it's the best male protagonist we've read, right?
Umm, Stanley. Maybe you could just unspool a little more each time you need to...
[on phone to Jim] There���s nothing down here.
[pointing to the window in Michael's office] Oh, Michael marked his heights. He's grown!
Yeah. I'm in charge of this whole area.
So, imagine like the real estate version of Michael Scott and that was this guy. He did half the interview as Ace Ventura.
Well, you shouldn���t be nervous about this. This is a tiny start-up with a bunch of guys just as dorky as Jim.
Oh, yeah! We have such a solid foundation, you know.
Maybe we'll use a DJ. That's the one thing Roy's in charge of for this wedding but all he's managed to do is set a date.
Are you going to cry, Jim? Do you need a tissue?
You can't be a part of our relationship, Michael.
No, I umm, well I'm not gonna, I'm, I'm not gonna move in with anyone unless I'm engaged.
Amok. It means, don't let your imagination run out of control.
We have an extra outfit in the bag.
Just let us open up the presents, Dwight.
I don't think Jim cares about his hair.
My theory is that... [Jim signals he's leaving, waves bye to Pam]
Uh, could I please have your attention? So a year ago, I got my first art commission to paint a mural for Dunder Mifflin and I decided to paint the history of paper���,which was just some trees and stuff. And then someone spray painted a bunch of butts on it and I had to start from the beginning. But it all worked out for the best because I think that I���ve painted the perfect thing which is the history of us. All of us. And this is for you Jim. [applause] And go ahead! [drape drops and everyone cheers]
[surveying an untidy office] The building���s custodian is on vacation for the month and Dwight is too cheap to hire a replacement. So, instead, we���re living in filth. But, not for long. Because I have created the chore wheel.
Okay, it's just three or four steps but thank you, thank you.
Cute. [enters office area] Very funny, everyone. Who wrote captions under my doodle? I'm not even kidding. They're pretty good.
So you guys, you know what's an even more useful treat...is cash. So-
Andy, I am getting married in 8 hours.
Can we take a look at the suite now?
[going up to give Dwight a hug] Thanks for much for helping the company, Dwight.
I need to get out of this dress.
Kevin, you and Stacy set a date yet?
Why did you put it off until Halloween?
Okay everyone, I know we're really excited to see this movie that everybody's in, but we have to remember that Michael is sensitive, so let's stay positive! And no laughing, no comments, just positive energy and we'll have a pure fun day! Okay?
Guess who just got into the Pratt School of Design.
OK, we're leaving for the hospital at 1.
There are a few people I decided not to invite, and that might make things kind of awkward but ...  it's my wedding. And I don't want anyone there who has called me a hussy.
I don't know, I just, I really thought Jim was gonna propose tonight...
[turns around, is wearing a mustache] Bye, Stanley! Love you! [waves, Stanley leaves]
Of course. He's one of my closest friends.
Sure, but we should get to the bottom of this. Let's pick a rumor and trace it back to the beginning.
Not well. A doctor won't come out to collect a check for $700.00, or $500.00 if we go with the giant check.
Umm, I put stickers so you know where to sign.
[holding lamp] You like it? It's kinda designy and cool, it was $8.00.
Hi..  I was just coming out to see what you were doing and to maybe stop you.
He didn't leave me. He just went part time. [Meredith scratches her head vigorously] Can you just fill out the form please?
Thought you were millionaires, yeah. That's funny. Shoot, I knew that one.
And, I haven't gotten paid yet. I'm not blaming you.
What? What is it? What? What is, oh, my God! [Jim starts attacking snowmen] Honey? Jim? Jim!
Oh, that wasn't the night crew. That was Dwight.
[On phone] About 10 minutes ago. No, I didn't know what to say.  Yes, I know.  Um, I don't know, mom, he's my best friend.  Yeah, he's great.  Yeah, I think I am. [Jim enters] I have to go. I will. Listen, Jim... [They kiss]
Roy was supposed to pick the band, but he's concentrating more on the bachelor party now.
Well... I always dreamed of a house with a terrace upstairs. Plant flowers on it... stuff like that. Since I was a girl. Um... More seriously though, a husband that I love... Roy. And I love to draw. And I... I did a little in college and I'd still love to do something where I could work with art or graphic design in some way.
Oscar, Toby, and I are founding members of the Finer Things Club.  We meet once a month to discuss books and art, celebrate culture in a very civilized way.  Sometimes the debate can get heated, but we're always respectful.  There is no paper, no plastic, and no work talk allowed.  It's very exclusive.
I think it's gonna put a damper on the party a little.
So ok. I'm watching the movie, by myself...
You know what they say about a car wreck, where it's so awful you can't look away? The Dundies are like a car wreck that you want to look away, but you have to stare at it because your boss is making you.
Meredith...  [copier has an error] Oh... so uh... G-44.  It's not ready Kevin!
Maybe she's just pushing her breasts together to make them look bigger.
Well, I wish that made me feel better. Listen, so everybody saw the promos and they're kinda freaking out. [Brian laughs] Cause it seems like you got a lot of private stuff on camera-
Did you find anything good in your desk?
Michael has so many pictures of his kids he had to get two phones with two numbers and he pays two bills.
No, that's a great idea. Let's have a code name. How about Mondays? I hate Mondays? Mondays are the worst?
Michael, we were thinking maybe we could keep this thing going!
Hey, Meredith I need to tell you something.
And we're also supposed to speak our truths.
Well in your fantasy we're Stephen King characters.
I know.  If she wasn't an alcoholic before, she is now. [Jim laughs]
Hmm. I don't think so. But thanks. My building manager... is... You understand.
Michael, you shouldn't do anything that you're uncomfortable with.
When Michael's skirting a phone call, he gave me a list of places to say he is. 'Stopping a fight in the parking lot. ' 'An Obama fashion show. ' Whatever... that is. Or 'trapped in an oil painting.' I'm gonna save that one.
Here's a suggestion computer.  I assume you read binary so why don't you zero one one, one one one one, zero one one zero one one.
Shut up Oscar.  What is wrong with all of you, he is sleeping with my mother!
She doesn't want you to return the barrette. She's not interested in you.
Really unlikely. But I can't say that it's impossible.
I'm gonna to miss Toby. He has a nice, calming presence in the office.
No.  No, but I'm allowing it.  Just come here.
[while leafing through Michael's appointment book and seeing nothing but free time] Um, oh boy, let's see, he's really...
Please stop saying what.  Can you take him?
Oh, Michael. You can't be nasty today. [whispering] 'Cause of the... [points to 'Welcome Daughters!' sign]
[voicemail message for Jim] Hey, I have a chance to sneak out of here early, and I'm not messing this up, so I'll see you tomorrow.
[On phone] Oh, great! Yeah, um, I'll get right back to you. [hangs up] Hey guys! Anyone ever heard of Iris Black on the radio?
OK. [Goes out onto terrace] Oh wow, you have a nice view.
When Jim decided to come back to Scranton full-time, I was relieved, but I also feel a little guilty. I mean, he���s giving up this big thing for me. But he seems happy. I mean, he���s certainly been goofing around a lot. I love goofy Jim.
Yeah... you could give it up though right? And almost nobody would know.
You know, you're in a meeting, and nobody knows that you've had sex there, except for you and him.
It's been a really rough couple of days... This helps a little.
I know it's wrong to fake going into labor just to get out of things, but sometimes it's necessary.
Everything is fine.  You don't have to worry.  Try not to think about it.  She's not coming out for a while, okay?
Well count yourself lucky. Wait until you have two. That's two sleep schedules, two naps that don't coincide, I mean, you'll never sleep again.
Why was he making her laugh so much?
Right? Thank you! It���s just Philly. Everyone���s acting like it���s New York or Paris or London.
Describe him exactly. What color mustard is his shirt? Yellow or Dijon?
No, Stacy is a boy.  Ugh.  Frustrating.  Why can't you just be in art class with me?
Michael, is, um, sick and he wants one of us to rescue him.
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. ... Uh, sure, I'll get him for you. [to Michael] It's Jan for you.
I'm supposed to turn the lock when I leave, it's part of my job.
[watching Michael's plane take off. Crying and has smeared make up on] No he wasn't sad. He was full of hope. About Colorado, and he was hoping to get an upgrade as an award's member. And he said he was just real excited to get home and see Holly.
Although, like, unlikely things happen all the time. My best friend, in High School, she went to Australia, Canberra I think, and she met this guy who lived only two streets away in America.
He's a big Meryl Streep fan, so I shouldn't be surprised that he's identified with her character.
Wrong baby!  This is not our baby!  Sshh.
I know. Yeah, and it was going really great at first. I got video.
Yeah, yeah. Like when he presses 'Doors closed' the doors open. Or he presses 'lobby' it goes to third floor, stuff like that. Can you do that?
I needed leverage so I pulled those pictures off the internet. It's just this Office Administrator thing, I don't wanna...
And I took a bong hit from my Bong Water with my pimp.
No, I���m familiar with spinning. It���s just that wouldn���t work with a chore wheel because people might get the same chore-
We need everything back the way it was.
[whispering] I���m so sorry. I hate this. You���re better.
Michael, do not let your imagination run out of control.
The warehouse got a ping pong table last week. Now Jim comes down and plays with Darryl. Sometimes I bring him juice. My boyfriend is 12.
You did good, Dwight. It���s okay. I mean, seriously, Jan���s not normal. Let���s just go. She���s not going to sell to us.
Hey, sorry, I really didn't want to come in. It's just that we have to go buy a new Christmas tree, and we're hoping we could borrow your truck.
Okay, Dwight, but if you do need a key, just listen it's under the...
[yawns] Yeah, or no... well... I don't know. I'm sorry. I was up all night with Cece, otherwise I'd be running this.
You came up to my desk, and said, this might sound weird, and there's no reason for me to know this, but that mixed berry yogurt you're about to eat has expired.
[in the car] We still surprise each other.
So this is like, um, an organization station...
Uh, not on a three month boat trip.
And we'd like to offer you 15% off your first purchase as our way of welcoming you to the area.
No, I mean doing that with Michael. How do you come back from that?
Great. Everything's great. Hey are you nervous about your big meeting?
Did a good job, Buddy. Now it���s time to come home.
That was weird, huh? It's all part of the presentation. It was confusing, right? Because confusing situations happen to us all the time in our jobs. [pauses] I'm just trying to bridge the gap between what just happened and the fact that I'm going to be doing the rest of the presentation.  [reading from the cards, in Forrest Gump voice] Sales is like a box a chocolates, you never know which vendor you're gonna get. Forrest Gump.
Phyllis! What are you talking- The whole card depends on this!
Let's see. Andy has been manager for a hundred and five days. Which means I've heard 'Closing Time' a hundred and five times. [nods and shakes head] Still don't know the words. Tah wa Ta way hm hm home and home and home.
What? No! No, I just had this brilliant idea- everyone loved it. You don't have a copyright on pranks. I might be better at this than you.
[sees Erin holding Cece] Oh, my God! Go, go!
Do you have any leads on a job?
[On phone] Oh, OK. No problem. Thanks. Hey guys, WPTU called.  The interview's off. They're opening a new cupcake store at the Steamtown Mall and Iris wants to cover that, so...
My veil tore.  I knew when we were getting married and I'm five months pregnant that I'm not going to be able to wear the dress that I always wanted or high heels--
Uh, we brought back some Puerto Rican candy.
Maybe. But it sounds like you're just wrong for each other.
Bottle of rum it is. [takes package out of bag] Alright, shall we?
Besides, we have something those other people don't have, which is a home and a bed.
I have the most boring job in the office, so... why wouldn't I have the most boring job on beach day?
[whispering] I'm so sorry. [Angela, Phyllis, and Pam all whispering] ... seriously, we're just...
I just mean because you know us and you like observed us for ten years and I feel like he's- I just feel like...he's so into his work right now and....I don't know, am I crazy?
A little smile and a nod shows that I hear you. Got it?
Thank you.  Um, listen I just wanted to confirm that you're not coming to the wedding, which is totally understandable and more than fine.
Nope.  No, no, that's better.  That wasn't even the worst of them.  I'm fine.
Sometimes there's a lot of time between the calls.
You can't, I locked the office from the inside when we left.
Oh, hey Jim. Some prankster switched the elevator buttons on Dwight.
No. No no no! [nos coming from all employees]
On your backhand. [Jim opens the conference room door and enters]
Erin, it's not up to you. This computer was for reception! Okay? It's not yours to give away.
[goes to change thermostat as Dwight puts a locked cover over it] Hey. What are you doing?
Michael, he means the Wall Street Journal online.
No, I didn't mind helping Jim with his problem. That's what friends do. I help Phyllis all the time. Just yesterday, I untangled a piece of tape from her hair. So, yeah.
Ok.  There's a transcript between a naval ship-
Hey, I would just love to schedule a meeting today with Dwight.
Michael, let me make this very easy for you, I could give a sh[beep] about your happiness!  Stop dating my mother!
[after Michael returns with coffee] With cream and sugar?
Hey Oscar, big Will and Grace fan huh?
Um, I think I'm gonna be up at the lake.
Well, I don't wanna speak for Jim, but, it's like pretty official. [Jim smiles]
[voicemail message for Jim] Hey, guess what?  I moved my computer so I can't see Michael's head.  It's working.  I think I can have a career as a very specific type of decorator.
Are you sure you don't want to play?
Really? Okay, well, um, I like consistency in the manager's position, no weird silent coups. Stuff like that. I'm easy.
We have a meeting with an investor today.
Let's grab some ice cream, go back to the office, and finish what we started. [others nod in agreement]
Prison Mike? What was the food like in prison?
Dunder Mifflin this is Pam. Oh, hey Mom. No, what did Dad say?
I don't think we registered anywhere. We just want cash.
No, no. It's the principle of the thing.
[telephone ringing] Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. Um, hold, please. [to Jim] There's a Brenda on the phone for you. [to Brenda] Just one second, I'll transfer.
Yeah, um, there's good things about Michael. He uh, uh... Yeah, definitely. Um...
Maybe you could play a song on your recorder.
What? [opens her eyes, Michael is standing over her] Oh...
So, maybe just try one at first, and then if it's okay, have a couple more...
[answering the phone] Dunder Mifflin, This is Pam. Oh, I���m sorry. Jim Halpert doesn���t work here anymore.
Wow! He really pulled out the big guns. Fake crying. Did not expect that.
Ha ha. That���d be great. Kind of like ditching school, except instead of getting suspended, you get��� What do you get? Oh my god! Why didn���t I think of this? Andy���s not here. Oh, hey, Erin, um, I���m expecting a shipment of pens. Can you cover that?
Well, it was, uh, it was really nice meeting you, Alan.
Yes, the conference room is set up. I've got pens, I've got paper, I've got a whiteboard, we are good to go!
Mom, I'm sorry. I know you and Dad are chipping in for the wedding but I do not want orange invitations. Yes! Well, if you really want my...
I don't really have any control over that Stanley.
Jim said mixed berries? Well, yeah, he's on to me. Um... [Laughs]
How would wiping it with a paper towel make it worse?
Yes, but Reception is a one person department. If I get you a new computer I have to get one for everyone in sales. For Dwight, for Stanley, it would be crazy.
[everyone yelling at Pam]You guys, I am so sorry! It's just been so chaotic with Jim gone, that...
I feel bad about what I wrote on the bathroom wall.
Oh, awesome.  You're a life saver.  [drinks from coffee cup] Wait, is this just milk and sugar?
I don't know I'm really committed to winning.
Well the breadsticks are like what then, Ryan, what can I use?
I feel like he���s always making these decisions for the family, and then I���m left playing catch-up.
Michael, you need to get out of this.
Would any of you be saying any of this if the cupcakes were from Supermart?
0-1-7-5. Thank you. Bye, bye. [to Michael] It really makes us look unprofessional.
I thought I was very specific about you not letting up a magician.
No. Except for the pendant that you bought me. Which I love.
Hey, why don't you just go up to your office, get some work done, and I'll just bring you a pretzel.
Oh my God, Ryan! That's perfect! You have to go!
Okay, when you���re selling to women, it is crucial that you listen, Dwight. Also you want to respect their... Are you listening now?
Yeah.  Dwight, Michael wants to see you in his office. [Dwight runs in]
Yeah. I love being on the road, but I especially love the time and a half pay 24 hours a day, for three days. Cause I have a mortgage now, got a bring home the bucks.
Yeah, but we don't have a power cord.
[singing] Just smile for me and let the day begin.  You are the sunshine that lights my heart within... on the wings of love ...
This is possibly our new Dunder Mifflin office.
Michael and his jeans.  He gets in them, and I'm not exactly sure what happens.  But I can tell you, he loves the way he looks in those jeans.  I know that's why he started casual Fridays.
Yeah.  Wait, what, the mess or the note?
Oh no, do you think it was stolen?
How can you give us performance reviews if you don't know us?
There's no one from England, Jim.  Katie studied in Ireland - this is Stacy, the one who does the Murakami-style collages.
No, no, that guy who hit on me.
[answering phone] Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam. He's not in the office. Can I take a message? I will. You too. [hangs up] Sorry. What's up?
Sick, like lots of sniffling. I don't know.
Hey, Angela.[hands her a Save The Date card] I didn't have your zip code.
I have never, ever dated, or wanted to do anything resembling dating Michael, ever. Not ever, not now, not then, not now, not ever, ever.
So, Stacy and Eric get to Bogre's DeTech half an hour early so they don't have to sit on the slab.
This was tough. I suggested we flip a coin. But Angela said she doesn't like to gamble. Of course by saying that she was gambling that I wouldn't smack her.
Really, you can���t be scared of a room full of Jims. I love the guy, but he���s basically Gumby with hair. [Darryl laughs]
Good morning, Mr. Wonka, here are your messages.
Michael, I... [sits down] I hate to say this, but... you know this special bond that you've always felt with Ryan, where, like, you're best friends or you're his mentor or something?
I don't know.  I just, I can't tell if she's getting anything.
Sometimes when he's not here, I try to throw stuff in it.
Dwight, there is one rule that you need to take very seriously.
[pulling her new shirt out of a box] Ok.
Yeah, I'd love to see them. Oh, and tell them I say, 'Congratulations.'
[to delivery men] Uh, hi, can I help you? I don't think anyone here-
Oh... is there another wedding at the hotel this weekend?
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. [excited] This is Pam. I did?
[over loudspeaker, imitating Darth Vader] Luke, this is your father. Come set the table for dinner.
OK, well, why are you laying like that?
[on phone] Yes, I understand.  Can I transfer you to customer relations?
I have decided that I'm going to be more honest. I'm going to tell people what I want. Directly. So, look out world, cause ol' Pammy is getting what she wants. And, don't call me Pammy.
Oh, yeah, no. Don't worry about it. I mean, he was being ridiculous.
Well, I appreciate that some opportunities can be unpleasant- [Jim's phone rings, he answers]
Wait, when am I...? You just have to be clear and firm. You know, just tell him you don't love him. Just be honest with him. [Erin nods]
I-- I thought they were confused at least...
Michael likes me to run the camera when he makes his apology videos. My favorite is the one for his mother.
Oh, wow. I forgot how pretty your house is.
No no no no no! She'll wake up!
Jan called. She's coming in later to talk to you.
It's a blessing in disguise. Actually, not even in disguise. Sometimes at home, I answer the phone, 'Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam.' So, maybe that'll stop now.
Just one. 'This weather makes me want to stay at home, curled up with a good book.'
Hang up. [Creed hangs up] Corporate needs you to find the differences between this picture and this picture. [shows Creed two similar-looking photos of some building] Intel has told us there were at least seven.
I've really been putting in the hours on this mural. And my boss is totally OK with it, because he's in the Bahamas and has no clue what anybody is doing. I'm usually very self-critical. I hate what I paint. But, I don't know, this time I feel like it's, um, it's really coming together... [sees mural] Oh my god! [camera pans to mural with butts painted over it] Wha? You've gotta be kidding me! What it... are those... are those butts? [to warehouse crew] Huh? No way. No way!
Except where Juliet doesn't have that great a time and Romeo doesn't call back after two dates.
Roy and I just got back from the Poconos.  I get ten vacation days a year, and I try to hold off taking them for as long as possible, and this year I got to the third week in January.
[whispering] No, no, no, you have to do it-
I just want to say, that this was the best, Dundies, ever! WHOOOOOOOOO!!!
No. My goodness. You have a lot going on. With Robert and everything.
Did you have a lot of sugar today, Michael?
Oh, wow, it's almost time for ultra feast!  Where's Kevin?
Lord of the Ring stuff? I don't know, I'm just trying to think of things that were happening at the time.
It's the world's tiniest Bluetooth. I found it in a Japanese gadget store in the village. I got one for Jim, too. Jim, say something.
I worked until about 2:45 AM. And then I had to decide if I wanted to spend the night with Michael editing in his office, and Dwight watching Michael edit in his office, or drive home and probably fall asleep at the wheel and die in a fiery car wreck. I passed out on my keyboard trying to decide.
Just because two people are hanging out, it doesn't mean that they're together,  you know?  Like people can just be friends.  And I think that it was really unfair to think that there was anything else going on.
[Jim rushes to open door for her] Thank you.
Because everything makes me cry, so what���s the difference? This dog, he just wants to protect his bone.
Listen, are you bringing anyone to Jim's party tonight?
I think that I should help him get home.
Good. Good. And���[Nellie hits the car against the bushes]
Kevin, you cannot possibly save enough time to see the world.
I'm sure it's fine. it's a blue shirt.
It might seem crazy, but since there's no one left in New York, Michael is Dunder Mifflin's highest ranking employee. So, that's where we are.
Actually Andy, I think maybe we experienced it.
[telephone ringing] Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. Hold, please. Dwight, it's the Sheriff. He said that it's really important. It's regarding your desk. I'll transfer.
Stop eating it! Do you wanna be happy? Look at you. You have a major self-destructive streak in you.
What does that even mean? Where would your name appear?
That's weird, my breast pump is missing. Have you seen my breast pump?
What's going on? Do you know that guy?
Dwight is taking Ryan on a sales call today. So if we find Ryan's body in a heavily-wooded area tomorrow, I owe Jim $30. It's an old bet, but a deal's a deal.
We found a great local daycare. It's rated really high by all the local parenting websites. But that means it's also really hard to get into.
Okay.  So, I'm just not sure if I'm releasing, though.  I'm not sure if...
[on phone] So, there was no sales call.
Well, what about the other stuff that has to be in today?
So place it on the infinity thing without being obvious, you know? I'd love to do like a color version just to bring a little color to the logo.
No, I���m not upset. I���m really excited for Darryl��� Maybe I���m a little disappointed that we���ll be losing him.
Oh my gosh, wait until you. This guy was unbelievable. Ok so-
Yeah, do you need a hand? [everyone joins in]
See all this like old stuff, like um, there's that shot of Jim and I up on the roof?
He finally has a story everyone wants to hear... and he knows it.
Dreams are just that. They're dreams. They help get you through the day. Like the thing about the terrace. It's nice but... um... I don't know. It was just something I read in this book when I was twelve. The girl in the book has a terrace outside of her bedroom and she planted flowers on it and I just loved that. Just always kind of stuck with me.
Michael and Jan together in Jamaica. I guess I would just need a little bit more evidence than seeing it with my own eyes.
Michael doesn't know how to work his BlackBerry.  So when he says BlackBerry me a message, he means write it on a Post-it note and stick it to his BlackBerry.
Do you think you could work from this? [showing Tattoo artist sketch pad] we made some small adjustments.
We're all in it, from like years and years ago. It's like a home movie.
Yeah, I mean, if it's all the same for you.
Hey honey, I don't think we should push him.
Hey Oscar.  It's Pam. Hey. We're on our honeymoon.
So someone is going to a court. Big deal.
So this was all just a trick. You don���t really have any business to give?
[hesitates] I am. I am the office administrator!
Yeah! Oh, so I guess Oscar and Jim were talking your ear off about the new copier.
[to Darryl on phone] Hey, you know that guy Frank who works in the warehouse?
You know, Jim���s kind of nervous about it, but I think it could really help.
We need another approach. Um, we need to fine the weakest one and separate him from the group. [they notice Nate struggling with a box] Yeah. I think if we could get Nate alone, we could crack him.
What do I think? I think everybody should stay out of everybody's personal business!
[sees Ryan coming through door] Hey Ryan. Welcome back --
Five bucks if you can get him to admit it.
If you wanna do something for the funeral...
Because, um, cause I'll never wonder ever again. If I did something wrong and... Now I have closure. She's happy and, I don't know, it feels good.
Wow, I thought that was supposed to be, like, next month.
Have you ever had a conversation with Kelly where she didn't go on for 15 minutes without taking a breath?
...and he said, That's what everyone sees, that's the Man In Black.
I mean, help, if it's something simple, like add page numbers or laminate it or...
You have to get rid of all your weapons. All of them. Including killer fish.
I can't hear anything, there's like, there's like machines going-
Okay, this is just a Christmas card from your paper supplier. No one's putting this on their fridge.
Yeah. I���m afraid he���s only gonna have hot dogs.
Nope, and we're gonna need a loaves and fishes kind of miracle to feed 'em all.
Oh right, okay. Hey Stanley, it's great to see you!
I had just woken up. I didn't look cute. That's how I knew he meant it.
Oh, yeah. Uh, I think I remember that from back from when I first started.
My old art room. [finds a sheet of blank paper] Oh, maybe it's still here! [looks for her painting] No. No they must have taken it down. Never mind.
I've heard that. [reaches down to pick up bagel from the floor]
I'm sorry, we're throwing a party for someone because they're being horrible?
Right... you're a sports writer in Philadelphia? Nice build too.
I don't know, I think I was just staring at my desk.
Listen, um��� I was scared, you know? I loved what I had, and I didn���t want to risk it. And I think that maybe I did doubt him a little too. Which was wrong because he���s shown me time and again. But when the documentary started airing, people on the street told me that I had this fairy-tale romance. But there were a lot of times last year where it did not feel like a fairy tale. But then it got deeper, and it got stronger and now it���s better than a fairy tale. It���s like a long book that you never want to end.  And you���re fine with that because you just never, ever wanna leave it.
I'm not saying she's in love with him. But she could have left a while ago. Most printer sales are done over the phone, Ms. Boob shirt.
That's a very rude thing to say, Kevin.
[at her desk, grabs her plant and sees it dried up, looks at Jim] Oh. You couldn't have watered it?
I cannot wait for that joke to be over.
I'm sorry, can we just hurry this up? I've got a game to get back to.
Kevin, um, let's think of something to distract us. Uh, like the movie Skyfall. You loved the movie Skyfall, right?
Oh- [both look at each other and together say] Thank you.
Wow. He is officially the worst human being.
Ohh, hey Gabe, I'm sorry, we... we didn't get you a cake or anything. We're gonna miss you.
Ahh!  I'm sorry, I didn't, I didn't see you come in.
How could I have thought that? How could I have thought that?
I can't believe he's getting a CAT scan.
Oh, um, well, you know, I��� I just��� I just think I would rather keep that private. You know, if you���d been filmed for nine years of your life, there���d be some things that you just wanna keep to yourself.
Hey. You know I was engaged before Jim.
Well what was I supposed to do, let you walk all over me?
And Michael, you don't have rabies. And chances are you're not going to get it anytime soon. So... you don't really have to think about it too much.
Why did you put Dwight in charge of that? He did a horrible job.
Because we're usually not on the same page.
What are you going to do with your time off?
[looking at an engagement ring on Angela's finger] It's gorgeous, Angela.
Down.  You have to sit down so I can get the full effect.
[in Jim's ear] Ask how he's doing since the breakup.
Look at her. Even I want some fries with that shake.
Oh, and if he makes a joke, just laugh it up, no matter what. Okay?
I was going to say good because I'll have all the help I need?
Okay, I get it. [Michael laughs] Why are you giggling?  Is this a joke?  [Michael continues to laugh] Michael, is this-- did I get the job?
It's only for three weeks, you know with my mom and sister at the house it'll be..
Let me make something clear. Jim and I have never and will never have sex in the office.
They're considering him for a top secret mission. There's his application. Oh, and this is where I made him list every secret he promised he'd never ever tell.
No I���m just, I���m saying, what would happen if they didn���t sing it? Would they go to jail? Would they be shot?
Oh. [laughing] I really thought I didn't get it.
No, I mean, just 'cause we like got along so well.
I recently met Sue, the office administrator at Vance Refrigeration. She has this awesome wall full of fun initiatives and morale boosters and stuff. Sue just goes for it, she's awesome.
Yeah. Um, do you have any other pictures of Astrid?
Ok [squeaking sound] Oh that was just me. Pregnant Pam. And I make sounds much worse than this.
I just drove twenty miles round-trip back to the office to get Michael a single sheet of white paper. So, I could have just had them fax it to me, I guess.
I forgot what a super, nice girl Katy is. And just... good for Jim! They are so cute together. And, um, what an adorable car.
Yes, he bowled 5 frames with this pink sparkly thing until a little girl had to ask for her ball back.
Well, I'm not an artist, and I'm not a salesman. So what would you call it?
I didn���t watch the whole documentary. After a few episodes, it was too painful. I kept wanting to scream at Pam. It took me so long to do so many important things. It���s just hard to accept that I spent so many years being less happy than I could have been. Jim was 5 feet from my desk and it took me four years to get to him. It���d be great if people saw this documentary and learned from my mistakes. Not that I���m a tragic person. I���m really happy now. But���it would just���just make my heart soar if someone out there saw this and she said to herself ���be strong, trust yourself, love yourself. Conquer your fears. Just go after what you want and act fast, because life just isn���t that long.���
And get your flu shot. Also, I'm going to set up hand sanitizing stations around the office.
Jim is great. Being with him just takes away all the stress of planning my wedding.
But I'm holding on because I keep waiting for Sandra Bullock to show up.
This isn't about sides. This is about me seeing a blueish gray old man in the mirror and then he vanishes.
Oh, wow. Seriously? Oh my gosh, is that champagne?
Cut.  That was your best apology video ever.
[smiling] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. One moment I'll transfer you.
So now everyone hates Andy, and it's this whole mess, and I don't know what to do.
She's just, she's really tentative about latching, and I just, I want to keep her self-esteem up.
Because I'm never gonna act like that, even in your fantasy.
Andy that's way too personal of a question.
It's possible that some people thought it was your birthday.
[Michael walks in dressed as Willy Wonka] Good morning, Michael.
Things are a little slow here. And there's only so much cold-calling you can do in a day. Turns out there's no limit to the number of cheese puffs you can throw at someone's face.
[smiles] Go ahead.  I think it's your turn.
We can't help you if you don't just tell us what happened.
Maybe it'll be good because then she can like socialize with the other babies.
Yeah. No, no, I'll um-- the hundred. I'll just take the hundred.
No, normal women don't do stuff like that. This is bad. [Karen nods and Michael looks like he's about to start crying]
No, I know that you���re, like, happy and, like, you had fun today.
What are you doing? What do you expect me to say to that?
That means another twelve weeks.  [pause] Can you do this for another three months?
Ryan invited some of the branch managers and Toby into the woods for a 'get to know you' weekend. Michael wasn't invited. Apparently they already knew everything they needed to know about him.
I have Ben Nugent on the line, he is the top salesman in Utica.
[reads memo] 'Sleeves down to the wrists, buttoned-up collars, and muted colors.' Nobody dress like that. [camera pans over to Angela]
[walks in the conference room where Jim and Dwight are playing ping-pong] How's it going?
Angela, I want to talk to you about something.
No, wait, come on.  I didn't miss a day, I came in early, I stayed late, and I doubled my sales last month.
Um, no, I was just, um, just having a cup of coffee, kind of warming up for the day.
You told me to buzz you about the suggestion box meeting when Jan was here.
That's fizzling. I mean, someone has to start the fizzle.
Well, a gay man would not leave the store wearing those shoes!
So Santa, what can we expect from this party?
Oh... God.  Oh my God, he's gonna jump.
Well, you have to choose a food option and there's information in there about directions and lodging...
Yes... nice!  I can't remember the last time someone made me dinner.
Ben Franklin, do you wear boxers, briefs, or pantaloons?
Exactly. That should tell you how terrible the chairs are.
I'm sorry, Michael. I need you to say it. I'm so sorry.
Oh in three months we can. Check the lease, and if you don't undo all the changes you've made, we're moving. Hey guys, can I show you some pictures.
Wait! What you should do, Michael, is have a doctor take a look at it. Because we really don't know what that is.
I���m an oncologist and you are a dog.
Is it because of Michael? Did he actually do something?
I used to be young and cute and sorta funny and I could do those cute, little cartoons. And everyone who came through here was like, ���Who���s that receptionist? I like her.��� Now I���m just a fat mom. Yeah, and you take one look at me and you���re like, ���Oh, loser.���
I finished my laundry.  Got all my socks.  Nothing like that time that crazy guy pushed you.
[Singing, Pam mumbling lyrics] Closing time, time for you to go home to the places you will be from.
Bill Bourbon was my uncle.  I would have never hurt him any more than I'd hurt a June bug.
A party. It's not an excuse to get really drunk or confront someone or have a cathartic experience of any kind.
[laughs] You're very quick on your feet. I remember you. Funny.
No, I'm kidding. Um, so you got big plans this weekend?
You've already disappointed him so much.  He can't be expecting a lot from you.
I think I should hire them all. Do like Lollapalooza.
Yeah, I've seen that with my kids. Um, it is tiny, but I've actually been commissioned by the City of Scranton to paint a mural-
I mean, I know that we said no big gifts, but I was kind of hoping you'd get me
[to Jim] Just go in.  Just go in, he probably forgot to text you.
Twelve drummers drumming. [marching drum band lines up to perform, Andy steps out with cymbals]
Creed. I noticed you don't have a resolution on the board. What's yours?
[reading from Michael's flier] 'Drugs: Let's not and say we did.' I think Michael was high when he wrote this.
Yeah, Jim barely talks to Mike. We had to go through like two levels of friends to even find his profile. Jim picked someone just unattractive enough to shut me up without tipping it.
So um, I've been thinking about this whole chair/copier thing...
Yeah. I think you should call social services.
I don't think I'm asking for too much. I guess it's just the end of courtesy in the workplace.
He just had to wear his tux today.
We signed Cici up for this daycare. It's on the other side of town. The traffic...
What no, wait! You said you were gonna help us!
If he comes out, distract him. [takes list to copier]
The news that you just announced?  That Ed died?
Michael, it's time for the suggestion box meeting.
Nellie's pretty fearless. And I think she might be maybe even almost sort of fun.
Do you want me to help you with that?
Thanks.  My costume's getting a lot of attention. [Pam is dressed as Charlie Chaplin]
So. I've been thinking, after we win the lottery, we take our winnings....
Ah, yeah. We haven't told anybody, but it's going really great. [looks at Jim] Right?
Thank you. Really you guys thank you. Very sweet.
