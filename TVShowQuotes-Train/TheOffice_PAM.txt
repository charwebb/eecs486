If you talk to her, you're gonna tell her about Stanley, and that's gonna seem more suspicious.
We have a meeting with an investor today.
Then why isn't he scheming? Or preparing to avenge?
Oh, yeah. Uh, I think I remember that from back from when I first started.
I know Jan didn't poison the food. I know that. But if she was going to poison the food of someone at that table wouldn't it be me? Michael's former lover?
[on Bluetooth speaker] Hey, New York ain't free. Get back to work.
Good choice. [Kelly drags Ryan to the break room.]
You know, there are a lot of guys out there who would just love and appreciate a-
Why did you put it off until Halloween?
Oh, wait, I gotta go, class starting. [hangs up]
[to Darryl on phone] Hey, you know that guy Frank who works in the warehouse?
It's a good shredder, it just keeps breaking.
[looking with Kevin at the art show flyer] Should be fun.
Ryan, you should be more sensitive. It's obvious she likes you and comments like that, they just...
One, and then wrap around.  It's okay.  Hold that arm down.
So, Melissa... I met your mom a couple times. She's
No, wait, come on.  I didn't miss a day, I came in early, I stayed late, and I doubled my sales last month.
I meant to say something earlier. I just...
[shakes head] It gets in the breast milk. If I drink it, Cece drinks it six hours later.
[Pam's car pulls out of parking lot and then off to the side of the road] I told you I'm not dating anyone. And even if I was, I don't think it's anyone's business. I mean, when I do fall in love, like when it's for real, the last person I'm gonna talk about it too is a camera crew, or my co-workers. [Jim gets into the passenger side] Almost marrying Roy Anderson was as close to Pamela Anderson as I ever want to be. [Jim leans over and kisses Pam] Trust me, when I fall in love, you'll know.
You know, when Holly gets back, everyone will tell her what a great job you did. And then she'll realize what she's missing.
Oh look, they're starting. [all watch fireworks display; scattered applause and cheers; Darryl's band plays soft music]
Is Jim gonna propose tonight? He is, isn't he? No, he's not... Is he?
How are you Tom. Nice to see you.
Well... it's just that the weekends aren't good because, um...
[Andy shakes his head 'no'] Oh. No, no. [laughing] We're not together. No, no, no. Definitely not. Definitely not. No. We just work together.
I acknowledge with gratitude that you are being kind and responsible enough to include it in your calendar.
It just- [Kevin banging and shaking the snack machine]  To be making a case for passion in Edwardian times, I thought was, uh...
Look, I know what you have to do, please stay with Cece. Dwight? I've always considered for us to be very good friends. Great friends! Remember your concussion?
[walks in the conference room where Jim and Dwight are playing ping-pong] How's it going?
I know that Jim has an amazing story about a relative of his who got caught up in the world of drugs.
Uh, I've been engaged for three years, and there's no end in sight. So... you don't wanna ask my advice.
Hey, let's focus today. Make today all about focus. I'll help you.
[answering phone] Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam. He's not in the office. Can I take a message? I will. You too. [hangs up] Sorry. What's up?
Maybe, because it doesn't seem to be going super well.
Oh, thank you. I acknowledge and appreciate that you went out of your way to get me tea.
What? No! No, I just had this brilliant idea- everyone loved it. You don't have a copyright on pranks. I might be better at this than you.
Oh my God, I win!  Ok, it was a minor league hockey game. He brought his brother, and when I went to the bathroom, the game ended and they forgot about me.
This is possibly our new Dunder Mifflin office.
Just one. 'This weather makes me want to stay at home, curled up with a good book.'
Is it? I just, I liked our life in Scranton.
Robert doesn't talk like that. You have to stop Dwight from doing this.
Dunder Mifflin is having our first own garage sale. Like many Americans, we realized we had a lot of things that we really didn't need. And 10 cents of every dollar is going into the party fund so we can throw parties for ourselves.
And there are a lot of other people in this office who have money at stake. Other people you care about.
[on phone to Jim] There���s nothing down here.
Oh, um, well, you know, I��� I just��� I just think I would rather keep that private. You know, if you���d been filmed for nine years of your life, there���d be some things that you just wanna keep to yourself.
Yeah, well, you know, whatever happens. [Kelly puts her hand on Pam's shoulder] Oh.
You know, I changed a tire today. All by myself. This bathrobe's already coming in handy. [Meredith honking] Coming!
Yes, let's go. [looks at Erin and nods]
[watching Michael's plane take off. Crying and has smeared make up on] No he wasn't sad. He was full of hope. About Colorado, and he was hoping to get an upgrade as an award's member. And he said he was just real excited to get home and see Holly.
It's weird. Jan use to treat Michael like he was a ten year old, but lately it's like he's five.
I shouldn't tell you this, but... AJ won't commit to Holly. And she's gonna tell him that if he doesn't propose to her by the end of the year, it's over.
[Michael offers his coat to Pam, who is shivering] Oh, thank you.
I didn't tell you about the crying because I didn't want you to know how upset I was. Because it would've stressed you out and you're always saying how much you don't want more stress.
[watches Jim score in ping-pong against Darryl] Yes! Way to go. [looks at Kelly] See that?
[laughing] Oh-ho-ho! He talked about himself in the third person?
We're small, but we're eager to make a name for ourselves.
Oh, my gosh! People keep blowing it out of proportion! It's not even a history.
No, I mean doing that with Michael. How do you come back from that?
I have this little vacuum cleaner that's broken.  If Dwight doesn't work out, maybe that could be manager.
No��� don���t. Just put it out of your mind.
Last week Jim wasn���t there, and they named the company Athlead.
Well, you��� you bought the house without telling me, so I thought I could sell it without telling you.
Oh, don't get us wrong, we like picnics.
Roy was supposed to pick the band, but he's concentrating more on the bachelor party now.
The ones for drivers to check their blind spots?
[whispering] Angela, are you ready for the wedding?
The phone has been ringing off the hook. The guys in Philly are kind of going nuts.
Hey. You know I was engaged before Jim.
I know that it took me a little while to come around and its still a little weird to get used to, but you obviously make my mom very happy.  And that makes me happy.
Planned a wedding with him. He wanted hot dogs.
Yeah, we don't want them at the wedding thinking Jim's being marched down the aisle by my dad with a shotgum.
Uh... no. I just uh had some other stuff I had to do.
I gotcha one. [Pam hands over a grape soda to Jim]
On your backhand. [Jim opens the conference room door and enters]
I could tell Jo... or I could tell Michael.
I'm going to be okay, we should really try to make it until midnight.
You can tell Michael that I'm not leaving.
Try paperclips. Oh wait. This message. For Dwight.
Well, I didn't think that butt was funny.
Yeah, no, he asked for you specifically. He's in the conference room.
No. [Kevin leaves; Pam takes off her glasses; phone rings] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Okay, go ahead. [puts a notepad close to her face and writes message]
[in Jim's ear] Ask how he's doing since the breakup.
Oh, yeah, because we were kind of dramatic in the beginning. Well I don���t think anything���s gonna change in our lives now. With work and two kids there���s just-nothing interesting is going to happen for us in a long, long time.
Okay, here I come. [walks out in her wedding dress]
No, I mean it. [walks towards Michael] She's really nice and sweet and you guys might actually get along. [hands over card to Michael]
Because I'm never gonna act like that, even in your fantasy.
I'm sorry, can we just hurry this up? I've got a game to get back to.
[to Jim] Just go in.  Just go in, he probably forgot to text you.
Toby, was this your fun little way of congratulating us?
Some of us like the walk more than others.
It might seem crazy, but since there's no one left in New York, Michael is Dunder Mifflin's highest ranking employee. So, that's where we are.
[to camera] What? I'm not in love with her.
Um, Karen left her blindfold on the longest but she also threw her egg at Jim.
No, no. Jim had a great year, actually. I just wanted to get your opinion.
I guess you gotta move to Philly after all.
I'm not saying she's in love with him. But she could have left a while ago. Most printer sales are done over the phone, Ms. Boob shirt.
Usually the day we talk about sexual harassment is the day that everyone harasses me as a joke.
Yeah, well if it breaks all the way I can get you a new one.
Michael likes me to run the camera when he makes his apology videos.  He says he needs a woman's touch.
Look, I'm not the one who asked you to do a split when you've never done one before.
Yes, this is the only time I'm ever going to make this request.
Dwight, want me to get you some eggnog?
Psst. Jim. [Jim turns around. Pam nods head towards her for him to come over] Um, hey. I need to give you your Christmas gift now because, well, I'll just tell you.
Yeah, the um, the city commissioned me to do the-
[laughs] No, I was just checking out my present. [holds up teapot]
So someone is going to a court. Big deal.
This is weird with you facing the other way.
Jim. Can I see you for a second?
So we basically had no privacy for ten years.
No, under no circumstances can you read that letter. It's a violation of her trust.
Um, so, finally, I want to thank God. Because God gave me this Dundie.
[telephone ringing] This is Pam. Oh my God, are you sure? Uh, okay. Okay, um, we���ll be right there. Everybody, the balloon is falling.
Alright. Just don't worry, we'll figure this out.
Like the main company number? Because I'm gonna have to call information.
He means his mopey place, it's under that streetlamp that he thinks was in Casablanca.
I thought we were just having fun at the beach.
Although, like, unlikely things happen all the time. My best friend, in High School, she went to Australia, Canberra I think, and she met this guy who lived only two streets away in America.
I don't know! [Mose starts running by the left side of the car]
[enters the office and has another contraction]  Oh, whoa.  Ha.  Wow.
But I'm holding on because I keep waiting for Sandra Bullock to show up.
So, Jordan, uh, where did you work before?  Uh, a law office?
Oh my God, did you see 'The Apprentice' last night?
Jim and I went to dinner a few times when he got back from New York. I talked him through his break up. It's really nice to be good friends again.
And he wants to take the WaveRunners to the lake this Saturday so...
Michael told us to wait in here. We don't know why.
I don't think we really need that, Michael.
Oh, I'm kind of in the middle of -- yes please.
Yes, the conference room is set up. I've got pens, I've got paper, I've got a whiteboard, we are good to go!
Okay, that's a lot of good ideas. Thanks
[pointing to the window in Michael's office] Oh, Michael marked his heights. He's grown!
I'm not frustrated. Even if I were in Scranton, Jim and I would have days like this. We're just... a little out of sync.  You know, that's all.  Oh, great.  I washed my lipstick.
Well a giant check costs about $200.00 to make up. I have a print shop standing by but... What do you think Michael, that's over 25% of our funds?
And we need bodies in both these rooms, people. So please sign up.
No, I didn't mention that you cooked your foot.
I just wanted to let you that Dwight's gonna be ok.  The doctor said there's a really simple treatment for a concussion, so he'll probably even be back at work tomorrow.
Yeah. I���m afraid he���s only gonna have hot dogs.
He just had to wear his tux today.
Yeah, I didn't go through with the wedding.  I got cold feet, a few days before.  And I can't really explain it.  I just had to get out of that relationship.  We still had to pay for all the food.  So we froze it.  But I'm, I'm doing well.  I have my own apartment.  I'm taking art classes.  And I have lunch for the next five weeks.
Oh, my God. What are we gonna do?
I'm at a crucial point where I have sunk 4 hours into that copier, and I am not going to let it beat me like that wireless router did.
Of course, now Michael knows where to reach me 16 to 18 hours a week.
Well, if it makes you feel better, I didn't get one either.
Well yeah, but what if we turned our mike packs?
Michael, I think that what Stanley did to you was rude.  Maybe you should just get him aside and tell him that he was behaving badly.
[on the phone] Hey Kelly, my stuff just got here. [Kelly screams with excitement into the phone and Pam has to take it away from her ear]
We got you this. [gives a bottle of wine]
I don't know what to do! Do I go tell Jo, or - I don't want everyone to keep blaming the wrong person!
[goes to punch Michael; he flinches] You have to keep your hands down, Michael.
Maybe sort of ahead of his time as a writer.
Well, to speak my truth, I switched to coffee in March.  There's a new espresso machine. But I still acknowledge and appreciate the gesture.
I went out to look for a better office space.
Great. I am killing it over here. [drops mayonnaise on the ground] Jim, I gotta go.
I just drove twenty miles round-trip back to the office to get Michael a single sheet of white paper. So, I could have just had them fax it to me, I guess.
Michael doesn't know how to work his BlackBerry.  So when he says BlackBerry me a message, he means write it on a Post-it note and stick it to his BlackBerry.
It is totally inappropriate, but on the other hand...
Okay, Michael. Um, you know I love when you do that voice, but today, I'm so sorry. I need you to tell me that you know you're not Cece's godfather.
Hey, Toby. [walks past him to Kelly's cubicle]
Yeah, Bob Vance took her for a walk to calm down.
Angela insisted that all the animals be fully clothed.
[in conference room with the party planning committee] So Michael said we can do whatever we want cake-wise. What do we want?
You did good, Dwight. It���s okay. I mean, seriously, Jan���s not normal. Let���s just go. She���s not going to sell to us.
[Michael is Army crawling around the office] Michael?
[whispering] I'm so sorry. [Angela, Phyllis, and Pam all whispering] ... seriously, we're just...
We can watch a movie and play Rock Band.
Wow! You're shaking things up a bit, huh?
Australia? I have always wanted to go there?
I thought it was weird when you picked us to make a documentary. But all in all���I think an ordinary paper company like Dunder Mifflin was a great subject for a documentary. There���s a lot of beauty in ordinary things. Isn���t that kind of the point?
Has she been on the phone the whole time?
I'm gonna do it. And I fully expect to burn my feet and go to the hospital. That's the right spirit when doing a coal walk, right?
Umm. How many different ways are there to sniffle?
[over the phone] I just talked to my advisor. Failing.
Jim is great. Being with him just takes away all the stress of planning my wedding.
I can't tell if she's getting anything.  It just doesn't really feel right.
He can only keep one of us as a salesperson now.  He'll make his decision by the end of the day.
[on the phone] You can fax it over. Yeah, 5-7-0-5-5-5-0-1--
Don't tell him I said this, but I always thought he was kinda cute.
Phyllis has gotten into audio books and lately she's been listening to 50 Shades of Grey.  Which, if you don't know what it is, it's a book about um...
Hey Oscar, big Will and Grace fan huh?
Erin, you don���t need to call him that.
Michael and his jeans.  He gets in them, and I'm not exactly sure what happens.  But I can tell you, he loves the way he looks in those jeans.  I know that's why he started casual Fridays.
Besides, we have something those other people don't have, which is a home and a bed.
HEY!  COME ON!  Let's listen to Dwight's presentation! [Dwight winks at Pam]
Does it have to do with these shopping bags filled with hot dogs?
Sure. I mean, it's Philly. I can kill four hours. So uh, yeah. I'll see you at eight.
Hello everyone. We would just like to announce that our party is starting now in the break room. So... you can come by... .
I lied about some aspects of the building.
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh, hi Jan. He's, uh, on a sales call. No message? Bye, Jan.
A little different. What time is it there?
[taking Michael's picture] Okay, uh, point at the Dunder Mifflin.
Do you want me to beat him up for you?
[to cameraman] What? [looks at Dwight eating a Baby Ruth] Ohhhh... Yes!  Thank you!
I know you and Dwight have this weird deal, uhm, he sent me out here to see if you could postpone.
Michael's been trying to get Jim and me to hang out ever since he started dating my mom.  I don't know.  I really hoped this thing would just die out, but today he's planning a birthday lunch for my mom and we have to go.  No way out.  No way out.
Um, do we have to sleep in your parent's bedroom?
Thank you! Thank you. I got it. Now I know. You thought I was a little dorky. You know? [gibberish sounds] Okay. Well, excuuuuse me.
Yeah, you didn't need to actually say it.
[notices Angela's intense concern] Um... let's move on. I volunteer. Did anyone have a problem with me?
Nice. So, should I reschedule the rematch with Darryl now?
Jim, what are you doing?  Get in there.  This is not the time to take a stand.  At least he likes one of us.
She's telling me about all her amazing trip to Vietnam, I have nothing. I tell her our printers catch on fire, spontaneously!
You know, Michael. When I feel overwhelmed -
That's the weirdest possible solution to the problem.
Yeah, we walk around, everyone sees our faces and we leave, right?
Why did you put Dwight in charge of that? He did a horrible job.
Here, uh... Meredith? Why don't you put your hazards on.
You were way meaner to me than I was to you.
What? Come on guys. We need to figure out who did this and punish them. This isn't just about me. This is about all of us. This is our mural. Don't you see? How much we worked on this? How much time and energy? We put our heart and soul into this thing.
Oh, excuse me! I'm fine with my choices!
I dunno. I mean, maybe he'll talk to you about some of this stuff 'cause he can't really talk to me about it.
Hey, um, can I ask you a question?
[To camera] I don't care what they say, I just want to eat. Which I realize is a lot to ask for... at a dinner party.
The Senator? [Oscar nods] He was married before, and he has a kid.
He's really making you work for it, huh?
So how do you come up with your cartoons?
Dwight, that was really nice. You should ask for her number.
Oh, do you mean Darryl? That's a great idea. I'll ask him.
Oh I can help starting dinner if you need it.
[gets up and walks over to Angela, whispering to her] Hey. Thanks for ratting me out!
It���s going to be good to have someone hot at Pam���s desk huh?
[on phone] Dunder-Mifflin. This is Pam. [listens] Uh, yeah. [snaps her fingers in the air, getting Jim's attention] Just one second. I will, uh, transfer you to our manager, Michael Scott.
The guy has an algorithm to determine the winner of any given college basketball game.
I make that one copy, and I become the girl who makes copies, and by the end of the day I'm receptionist again. And the worst part is, I like making copies. The paper comes out all warm and stuff. And it's cold in there. Cause it's technically a closet.
Yes, I said you definitely should go, but you wanted to visit me instead.
And spend time with George Emerson.  That's what I would do.  I mean it's the best male protagonist we've read, right?
Umm, I put stickers so you know where to sign.
[telephone rings] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Hold please.
Awesome! I'll leave it up here so everyone can enjoy it.
And I took a bong hit from my Bong Water with my pimp.
[holds up single sheet of paper] Um, that's all we brought.
I guess that's why we have a temp, huh?
She has a boyfriend. He's out of town.
[hands over bag] I didn't, it's from corporate.
I can't hear anything, there's like, there's like machines going-
Now the bronze are really blue, and they're also the back side of the gold, so no flipping. K? Honor system.
Or I could come back as your personal assistant. You know? Sort your mail, set your appointments. I know all the people.
Oh you have to Jim? You literally have to?
No, no, no, 'Tracks of My Tears' and what else? What are some more? What's one more?
Oh ok, but in order for us to make it, there can't be any secrets between us.
Find someone else, I don���t know. Ask Phyllis.
We signed Cici up for this daycare. It's on the other side of town. The traffic...
Ten years ago, I didn���t care if Dwight  got married or died a beet-farming bachelor.  But having kids makes you so soft. I used to watch Pulp Fiction and laugh, and now I���m like, that poor gimp is somebody���s child.
Are you okay, Kevin? [Kevin gives thumbs down]
We need everything back the way it was.
Hey, Erin, it's Pam. How ya doing? No, no, don't put Cece on the phone, because she can't talk yet. Okay. No, I was just calling to see how everything's going. Yeah? Yeah? It's good? The play? The play is kind of great. I mean, it's fun to hear Andy sing in the appropriate setting. Now, he's really sorry you couldn't make it, too. Yeah. So thank you so much, again. We're having a great time. Oh, they're flashing the lights so we should go in. Thanks. Bye. Okay, so we called. And everything's fine!
Because she's not a sex model.  She's a tollbooth operator.
I finished my laundry.  Got all my socks.  Nothing like that time that crazy guy pushed you.
The thing about Jim, is when he's excited about something, like the Office Olympics, he gets really into it and he does a really great job. But the problem with Jim is that he works here, so that hardly ever happens.
Is it because of Michael? Did he actually do something?
[faxing, Erin watching over her shoulder] What are you doing?
[Delivery man enters with a bouquet of red roses. Pam stands up to look at card.] Phyllis.
No I���m just, I���m saying, what would happen if they didn���t sing it? Would they go to jail? Would they be shot?
Wait, um, does anyone remember when it was set up?
Wow, I thought that was supposed to be, like, next month.
But instead, you found something to distract you from ever picking out a chair.
We need more food. I'll go get some subs and sodas.
And then on the weekends, would you hacky sack back to reality and spend time with your wife and kids?
So we just... we wanna help you plan the proposal so that it's safe and responsible and realistic and doable.
Sometimes when he's not here, I try to throw stuff in it.
Maybe this is good. Finding another job is a pain. There's another annoying boss, another desk, I'd have to learn everything all over again. So, there are reasons to stay.
This is our first joint sales pitch. I think we're gonna work really well together.
I'm serious. Um, I'm really glad I came.
Things are a little slow here. And there's only so much cold-calling you can do in a day. Turns out there's no limit to the number of cheese puffs you can throw at someone's face.
Um, just cause, that, you work together, and it might be awkward.
Um... ���A���... ���X���? I don���t -- you got me.
You say one more word; I'm stopping the car.
Jim's at the dentist this morning. And Steve is an actor friend of ours.
No she's going to love it so I think you can keep the proposal simple. You know like when Jim proposed. He just he got down on one knee and he told me that he loved me and he asked me to marry him and it was perfect.
You guys, if I knew you wanted to do a caption contest, I would have drawn something more challenging.
Yeah, the bride doesn't really do... Have you ever been to a wedding?
Oh, hey, if you go by the Banshee Pub, tell the Man In Black I say hello.
I guess this is just one of those days.  It'll get better.
So one afternoon, while walking home from school, quirky 10th grader Becky Walters finds a wounded Pegasus in the woods.  And she becomes...The Horse Flyer.
You're gonna throw my things on the ground?
[to Jim] Hey. I feel so lucky we're in the same city for Valentine's Day.
An impression, then.  Lastly, we can't help but notice that he was by himself when he died, but of course, we all know that doesn't mean he was alone.  Because I'm sure that there were lots of other birds out there who cared for him very much.  He will not be forgotten.
Um, well, I could come back as a salesman. I have experience now.
This is not enough for you and I���m afraid that I���m not enough for you.
Why? Does he think you're going to Florida?
There is nothing dishonorable about talking about your life.  People like it.
Oh, no. I took a phone call in the middle of taping, and then when I went to turn it back on, I must have turned it off.
Actually, I put the catalog in your hands 'cause you have to pick out a new chair.
[over indistinct conversation] Good? Yeah, he said good, I'm good...
Oh my gosh. The honeymoon was great. We met this other couple at the resort, Frank and Benny. We hung out with them a lot.
Yes. Yes, I desperately want to speak with you about my sex life with Jim.
I think he thought his ukulele skills would transfer. [Jim leaves]
[walking into the annex with Jim] Hey, um...
Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. Uh... hold, please.
[enters on Michael alone sitting on a bed watching Glee] Michael? Maybe you should try gong in the other room again. You can have my seat. It's closer to the TV. It'll seem louder.
You guys, I don't think any of us are really qualified to be giving Holly personal advice about her love life.
I went on a date. It wasn't a love connection, um... I think when I like someone again, I'll just kinda know.
A party. It's not an excuse to get really drunk or confront someone or have a cathartic experience of any kind.
Okay, you just have to use the hand sanitizer first.
But don't you also have girlfriends in Paris?  Like a lot of them?
Okay-- just-- don't ever date a member of my family again.
If you're using more than three pieces of tape to wrap a present, you're doing it wrong.
Forget it. I'm never gonna know what goes on there.
Yeah?  I lose my appetite all the time.
Thank you. [goes to Michael's office and knocks on the door]
Andy, why should she have your crappy computer?
What's the rule about eating when people are in the bathroom?
I thought I'd stay and answer the phones.
So ok. I'm watching the movie, by myself...
Yeah, we should do that for real sometime.
Why do you need to wear the holster at all?
Yeah. I think maybe I want a 'wedding' wedding.
[walks into a movie theater showing The King's Speech]
Mom, have you decided what you want to be called?
We did, but mostly because people expect us to. We're also accepting other gifts not on the registry... However much.
One time we had an ethnic festival in Scranton. One time.
A dozen different pies? Cause that means rhubarb.
Um, there was an amazing buffet and there was a chocolate fondue... station. And what else was there?
Oh. That was like crazy. 'Cause I was...
Did you find anything good in your desk?
Michael, we were thinking maybe we could keep this thing going!
I just want to say, that this was the best, Dundies, ever! WHOOOOOOOOO!!!
Whoa! Hey! That is not OK. What are you gonna do about that?
Well I know how it is. I know it's a lot of fun. I don't know how it is. Andy, this is a lame job. What are you doing here?
I don't know.  I just, I can't tell if she's getting anything.
Why would I love that? Can we afford a delivery guy?
Maybe, but it's not good enough for me yet.
Wait, are you saying that into the phone or are you saying that to me.
We wrote a good review.  Under comments, we wrote, the natural aroma of the beets drifts into the bedroom and makes you dream of simpler times.
Nothing, it's just I had to sit here all day, while Phyllis got like an entire garden delivered to her.
[voicemail message for Jim]  Sudoku. Level moderate. 18 minutes. Suck on that, Halpert.
Oh, I just get those at any party supply place.
I just wanted to get out of my room for a little while.
Yeah, I get to do this like, every week.
You'll be Mr. Christmas by the end of the night.
[looking at an engagement ring on Angela's finger] It's gorgeous, Angela.
Our party is also starting now [opens door to break room.]
You know, she also said the waiting list is like eight months.
Wait, that's it? That's the question you're going to ask him?
Oh yeah.  Gotta get your REM cycle going with the whole sleeping.  Better than not.
49 again? That's nine years in a row.  This is now our longest family tradition.
The one in the really great mesh black high-back swivel chair?
Okay great.  [Isabel kisses her cheek] Yeah, I'll see you in a second.  [pauses] Wait, what? [tries to follow, but veil gets caught on wall and tears] Oh! Oh no!
I only have one goal today. To make one kid like me. Just one.
Before we kick off the party, I just want to remind everyone that an office party is just that...
No, it's fine.  I'm sure it must have been weird for Jim when Roy and I were joking around... that
Oh my God, Ryan! That's perfect! You have to go!
Do you guys want some food? The wings are really good here.
I use to love coming here.  The chicken parm is good.  Big part of my childhood.  Oh, maybe Michael will start dating that too.
So Sarah Kaya says to Eric, 'No way.  You can't reserve seats.' And Stacy gets all up in her face and Sarah Kaya picks up Stacy's new PM pad and throws it at the light box.
You came up to my desk, and said, this might sound weird, and there's no reason for me to know this, but that mixed berry yogurt you're about to eat has expired.
How come out of everyone in the office, I'm the only one that went with you? Is it because I'm that stupid? I mean, your own grandmother doesn't even believe in you!
What? [opens her eyes, Michael is standing over her] Oh...
Dwight. [to Troy] Michael will be out in a second.
Thought you were millionaires, yeah. That's funny. Shoot, I knew that one.
There's a finger-painting station and a curly slide. Am I too old to go here?
Oh, oh my gosh. Yes, but don't, don't say anything, okay? It's after my grandfather.
Wait, when did we start calling it that-
Hang up. [Creed hangs up] Corporate needs you to find the differences between this picture and this picture. [shows Creed two similar-looking photos of some building] Intel has told us there were at least seven.
I think you guys all remember my mom from the wedding.
I need to fit into my wedding dress. However, I'm also pregnant.
Because the thing you're saying I'm good at, is pushing a big green button a bunch of times.
Can you just tell me now if you're coming or not?
I traded with Dwight. Just, I figured, you know, you went to a lot of trouble and it means a lot. And also, Roy got me an iPod or was going to get me an iPod, so ..
Okay, everybody! After you walk the runway everyone has to vote for who gets the coupon book. And you can't vote for yourself.
No no, you can go home. I'm good.
It's not too bad. I get to shred things sometimes, do you want to see?
I know a lot of us have been feeling under the weather lately. It's that time of year. And according to a study done by the University of Arizona, they've discovered that your keyboards have hundreds of times more bacteria, per square inch, than a toilet seat.
Hey, why don't you just go up to your office, get some work done, and I'll just bring you a pretzel.
Okay. When I was 22, I worked there and everybody said the place was haunted. I didn't believe it until one day before we opened, I look up into the mirror, you know, behind the bar, and I see this old man dressed all in black, but when I turn around, there's no one there. So, I tell the cook my story...
Dwight is taking Ryan on a sales call today. So if we find Ryan's body in a heavily-wooded area tomorrow, I owe Jim $30. It's an old bet, but a deal's a deal.
No, no, I want my mom and dad to be there.
Yes, well, you guys all know Cece, but we wanted to introduce you to baby Philip.
I'll go.  [stands up, begins speaking with a southern accent]   My name is Deborah U. Tante.   Deb for short.
W.B. Jones is renovating their offices and their construction crews are taking up some of the parking spaces we used to get.
Jim said mixed berries? Well, yeah, he's on to me. Um... [Laughs]
I know you're a very busy man so I'll cut right to the chase. I'd like my old job back.
Actually, people are really unhappy. Um, Dwight sent around this memo and people are freaking out 'cause the...
[approaching Michael at elevators] Michael? [to others] He's over here!
Really unlikely. But I can't say that it's impossible.
Oh, hey Jim. Some prankster switched the elevator buttons on Dwight.
Alright, let's give her a break. We don't know for sure this is Meredith's fault.
[in New York, humming to herself to the tune of 'Centerfold'] Na na na na na. Na na na na na na na.
Let's just see how we feel when we get there.
[looking at pile on Michel's carpet] Oh... I don't know.
[Michael sits alone eating at the back of the kitchen, Pam comes in with Jim, Creed and Kevin] You should do more stuff like that.
Hey, I was thinking about dinner--- [Jim grabs her face and kisses her]
No, I umm, well I'm not gonna, I'm, I'm not gonna move in with anyone unless I'm engaged.
I wonder if she'll start calling you 'Jim'.
Oh my God, what is going on, is Dwight ok?
[on phone] So, there was no sales call.
[Michael knocks on Pam's desk] Yeah? [Michael points at Pam, himself, and Meredith, mimes drinking, driving, then points to his watch and holds up five fingers] I weirdly know exactly what you're saying to me.
Maybe she's just pushing her breasts together to make them look bigger.
How ���bout we wait til next year after you have your kid?
You get paid by the year at the bowling alley?
If you���re an artist, you have to be okay with the idea ��that you can���t please everybody all the time.
Tell me one thing about you I don't know.
Hey, Meredith I need to tell you something.
Now that I think about it, Angela and Andy might actually make a good couple.  But I couldn't do that to Dwight... or Angela... or Andy.
[at school in NYC] Can't believe this. [pulls out cell phone... sighs]
[loudly] I need you to sign this! So bad!
How can you give us performance reviews if you don't know us?
Yeah. I was kinda hoping you could. I gotta go. Bye. [to Dwight] Come on. [camera pans to Clark duct taped to a chair]
[to Roy in Jim's earshot] ...back so soon.
I don't think so Michael. Besides, I can't cheer against my fiance.
Lord of the Ring stuff? I don't know, I'm just trying to think of things that were happening at the time.
But it's free. And we'll keep our eye on them.
[enters conference room] Did you need me to take notes?
Well, I'm not an artist, and I'm not a salesman. So what would you call it?
Yeah, yeah. Like when he presses 'Doors closed' the doors open. Or he presses 'lobby' it goes to third floor, stuff like that. Can you do that?
If we check in after midnight, I get an extra day to recuperate surrounded by doctors.
Just a subway stop away are the best museums in the world.
[looks up] Why aren't you as mad or interested in this as me?
Okay, Okay. Um��� so��� this past year has been really great, and you���ve been great and I just��� I know that you had to make this choice and you had to give something up for me. But I never want you to have to give up anything. I just thought if I could get us an offer then there wouldn���t be anything standing in our way and I could come to you with this big Jim gesture��� and show you all at once just how much I love you and how much I really do believe in your future.
Sometimes when we IM, I send you that little winking face with the lipstick.
Not well. A doctor won't come out to collect a check for $700.00, or $500.00 if we go with the giant check.
We only had tonight free, and we really wanted to spend it with you.
No. It's a jokey saying. Pobody's nerfect, like I can't even say those words right. Ha.
[Dwight hands out handkerchief] Thanks. You don't need to stay here.
Oh in three months we can. Check the lease, and if you don't undo all the changes you've made, we're moving. Hey guys, can I show you some pictures.
But, ah, I suppose the second one is the better written line.
She says 'no' to everything. You know, she thinks my name is 'No.' Cece, do you want some broccoli?
Hi. [they kiss] Mmm. 'Cause-- [looks toward camera]
I almost lost it. That was too good.
Not even. I'm doing laundry for the first time in like a month.
Amok. It means, don't let your imagination run out of control.
Oh, no it's not that, I've actually been thinking that for a long time, and I'm glad I said it. I just... I'm sorry if it made you feel weird.
Hey, good luck. When you get to Philly, will you tell Jim I miss him?
Nope, that's Dr. Laura. Well, her show Biz Whiz wants someone from Dunder Mifflin to come on the air today. Does anybody feel particularly passionate about local business issues? [Dwight raises hand]
Cut.  That was your best apology video ever.
Not one of them called to congratulate me on our engagement.
I had to work late. Jan's making me keep a log of everything Michael does all day.
Hey, Michael. [Michael is sitting on couch outside his office] How you doing?
[telephone ringing] Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. Hold, please. Dwight, it's the Sheriff. He said that it's really important. It's regarding your desk. I'll transfer.
No. He just keeps letting all the calls go to voicemail.
I'm so sorry, Rolando told me everything.  How humiliating.  Would it help you to return to another age?  A time of refinement, and civility.
Yeah... you could give it up though right? And almost nobody would know.
Oh, Jim I should have told you I didn't get the job.
Well, my dad can't hear a thing. You could boom his whole life for him.
I can't. I'm really sorry if you misinterpreted things. It's probably my fault.
[on phone] Yes, I understand.  Can I transfer you to customer relations?
Aw. It's OK Angela. I have mommy brain too.
I'm guessing Angela's the one in the neighborhood who gives the trick-or-treaters some toothbrushes. Pennies. Walnuts.
Yeah, enjoy this moment, because you're never going to go back to this time before you met your desk mate Dwight.
Michael's got a few tricks for Valentine's Day. He found a place where you can get 12 plastic roses for $10 and he's got a great line. 'Me so thorny.'
Well... I have a job right now, so I can't really take time off...
[on phone] Yes! Yes! I would love to!
Angela, you seem so happy. I bet you wish you were like this all the time.
It���s getting tougher. I just didn���t know that it was gonna be this hard.
And Jim's mom suggested that Jim spend time hanging with the kids in his reading group, because she though that would be a good influence.
The architecture reminds one of a quaint Tuscan beet farm.
Nope. 'Cause we're really nice people but you don't seem to like us.
Yes, I know, but it's gonna be different.
He could have broken your nose or something.  Crazy.  It's just so stupid.  I mean, getting back with Roy and everything.  I mean, what was I thinking, right?
I saw you were getting along with Ryan again.
When you're a kid you assume your parents are soul mates. My kids are gonna be right about that. I guess it also means that sometimes love affairs look different to the people inside them. [Andy is in the background, looks incredulous]
Kevin, um, let's think of something to distract us. Uh, like the movie Skyfall. You loved the movie Skyfall, right?
[Reading Jim's palm] You're major and minor lines cross at a ridge - that sucks.
Uh, not on a three month boat trip.
Really? Oh, my gosh! We just have the one, but she poops for four. [laughs]
Um... Actually, we don't have any staff birthdays coming up.
Nothing.  I was just thinking of something else.
Don't you think the person who left the mess is the obnoxious one?
Oh. [laughing] I really thought I didn't get it.
Good. I thought you were going out for a drink with...
He said he can't help but tear up when he looks at it. It's like right next to his desk. He must look at it twenty times a day.
Yeah.  Maybe you shouldn't fake fire people anymore.
So this is like, um, an organization station...
Dreams are just that. They're dreams. They help get you through the day. Like the thing about the terrace. It's nice but... um... I don't know. It was just something I read in this book when I was twelve. The girl in the book has a terrace outside of her bedroom and she planted flowers on it and I just loved that. Just always kind of stuck with me.
Yeah.  Don't fall asleep at your desk.  [Turning towards the vending machine] Oh my God.
Guys, I'm proud of us. I think we did the right thing. [after noticing Angela easting cupcake] Hey!
That's not a real knot. When you pull on it, it disappears.
I think one of her cats did once. She came in with scratches all over her face. [both laugh]
Okay, it's not regulation size, but it'll do. You have to practice. You have to get real good and beat Darryl.
Michael... you shouldn't be with someone who doesn't make you happy.
Well, maybe we can put the box back together.
Just let him flirt with her. People meet each other all sorts of ways.
Hey, Angela? Did you hear about the Irish-American Cultural Center mural?
Then who do you think will get the job?
I haven���t told anyone here about the mural yet. I want Jim to be the first to know. Whenever I tell him good news, he���s always like, ���Beesly!��� I love that. Only thing better than getting the job-- ���Beesly!��� [chuckles]
I can't believe Angela. I went against my better judgment, and I gave her a Save The Date. And now it turns out she complained about me to Toby.
Roy gave it to me for Christmas.  I'm trying to figure out how to put songs on it.
it���s okay. You can sit in the annex.
We don't have any money. We don't have an office. We don't have anything.
Next on the list - open the mail.
We need another approach. Um, we need to fine the weakest one and separate him from the group. [they notice Nate struggling with a box] Yeah. I think if we could get Nate alone, we could crack him.
[pointing to staff members] Blazer. Freckles. Penguin. K.D. Lang. Holly's boyfriend. These mnemonic devices help to make a connection, and then, also to help you memorize names. I have a chainsaw! [holds up chainsaw, makes a wimpy chain saw noise] Cutting down the competition.
Oh, I have more. [Holds up bags of candy]
Why do you always think that girls are gonna be at the party? No one invited girls. It's just us.
That is right. Don't make any more of it.
I'm pretty happy these days. I'm getting married soon and I'm getting along with everybody at work.
Did you have a lot of sugar today, Michael?
Guess who just got into the Pratt School of Design.
Maybe because you hated her present so much.
[ascends on lift, using megaphone] Attention, everyone. Can I have your attention, please? Yeah, I don't know everybody's name down here, but whoever did this will you please raise your hand. [no one replies] Hello? This is not over. OK? I will stay up here all day if I have to. Is that what you want? [descends on lift] Yeah, I will also come down if I want to. It's my choice.
But these were not the kind of people who use their words.
You have to get rid of all your weapons. All of them. Including killer fish.
You're not the least bit curious to hear a poem straight from Ryan's soul?
Are you really going to apply for work at Scranton Breadworks?
Am I being mean to Dwight? I don't know. I did just make him run around the building and I have no intention of timing him. This isn't even a stopwatch. It's a digital thermometer. He does make my life harder, sometimes. And on purpose. Like he tried to put meters on the bathroom stalls as a way of bringing in more money for the company. [yells to Dwight] Hey, three more laps to go. Gotta pick it up if you're going to beat Toby.
Mmm-mm.  I'm probably just gonna stay here for a while, say I got lost.
You just said that we're gonna be gone...?
Uh oh. Someone started off on the right foot with the new boss!
Five bucks if you can get him to admit it.
Well, what about the other stuff that has to be in today?
OK. Well, here's something you don't know. A couple of weeks ago-
Okay everyone, I know we're really excited to see this movie that everybody's in, but we have to remember that Michael is sensitive, so let's stay positive! And no laughing, no comments, just positive energy and we'll have a pure fun day! Okay?
Actually Andy, I think maybe we experienced it.
Yes! Because with all of your support, by this time next year maybe I'll be down to one glass of iced tea a week.
[On phone] Oh, OK. No problem. Thanks. Hey guys, WPTU called.  The interview's off. They're opening a new cupcake store at the Steamtown Mall and Iris wants to cover that, so...
[Pam sees Mose in an outhouse] Oh my God. What century is this?
You know, I think there could be a lot of benefits if you could learn to get along with women.
Back off, Dwight. [serves] Hyuh! [the opposing team misses the ball, the Scranton team cheers] What?
So the sports marketing business that Jim told everyone about except for me?
Maybe Michael has a point. I mean, if she was really that upset, she wouldn't still be here.
Why won't you just admit that she's attractive? It's kind of annoying that you won't say it.
No. We're gonna make it like a prank. Like order bad food, give her this passive-aggressive card.
[Pam and Oscar are trying to repack cardboard box] Yep, yep.
[talking head with Jim] We haven't told anyone I'm pregnant.
You know, like aren't some things just so nice and cozy in the rain?
I did it. I learned everything about this machine.  I know all the buttons, even the inside ones.   I know all the error messages.  I could do a bound book, in plastic with offset colors.  Which feels...
OK, well, why are you laying like that?
Hey, everybody. Um, I decided to eat my cupcake. I thought about it last night. I talked to Jim. I talked to my sister. And, I think that, as long as Todd Packer doesn't know, it's OK.
The shipping place closes in a half hour.
Angela made several 911 calls about cars going too fast in front of the building, so the police put up a radar gun. It's actually caused a bit of a traffic hazard.
Wouldn't we get fired for smashing all the computers?
Ok. All of these things are important to remember but the most important thing is no one say anything about my pregnancy at the wedding.
[opens door] Erin.  Michael wants to see you.
It's really hard to demonstrate depression.  Their safety training had visuals.
Thank you. [takes bite] Oh my gosh. It's really good.
I'm not apologizing to anyone.  Michael owes me an apology.
We should get him a bus ticket. [types on computer] To make his trip easier.
My old art room. [finds a sheet of blank paper] Oh, maybe it's still here! [looks for her painting] No. No they must have taken it down. Never mind.
Just don't talk about the email, okay? He's gonna cancel it on his own, I really think he will.
Come on Andy! I mean you said you wanted a new computer and this is the best I could do!
Well, as I am sure you know, for the past few months, I've been the Office Administrator. Since right before you guys took over.
I'll just get a ride home from Angela.
No, no it wasn't Andy. It wasn't. It doesn't matter. It's not about who you've been with. It's about who you end up with. Sometimes the heart doesn't know what it wants until it finds what it wants.
Yeah, I get all the memos. [starts to leave]
Yeah. He said that you told him how much you love me. About how you feel when I walk in a room, and about how, you've never doubted for a second that I'm the woman you want to spend the rest of your life with. I guess he's never felt that with my mom, even at their best.
It's like mommy and daddy are fighting. Except mommy outranks daddy and mommy is way scarier.
[voicemail message for Jim] Hey, I have a chance to sneak out of here early, and I'm not messing this up, so I'll see you tomorrow.
[smiling] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. One moment I'll transfer you.
This is the last day of our summer interns. It's been nice. We haven't had interns for a while, ever since Michael's Monica Lewinsky incident. [interns are shown gathered around Kelly's desk, one holding a box of tissues, as Kelly cries and wipes tears] He didn't do anything sexual. [female intern opens a jar of salsa for Michael] He just made far, far too many Monica Lewinsky jokes. [Meredith rubs her breasts into Maurie's back] It was just easier for corporate to shut down the program.
Jim, just don't think of it as degrading. Think of it as, you happen to be moving the six inches his way and he happens to be biting it.
I was just wondering, what kind of jobs do you guys have?
Jim, Jim, honey, I love you, but you're really distracting me from my distractions.
Yes. But John Stamos was temporary. I quickly moved on to-
All I did was remind her that you used to treat her badly.
[sees Angela making check mark on tally sheet]
I mean, I know that we said no big gifts, but I was kind of hoping you'd get me
I've talked to Meredith, Stanley and Jim about the chairs. I know they're with me on this.
[exchanges looks with Jim] You're right. We should've realized that you are an equal part of this.
Hold on a second. [turning] Wait, what did you just say?
Dunder Mifflin this is Pam. Uh, I'm sorry, Michael's not here right now can I take a message? Great. I will. Thanks.
Okay, first off, my Keds. Because I couldn't have done it without them. [people clap] Thank you. Let's give Michael a round of applause for MC-ing tonight because [people start clapping again] this is a lot harder than it looks. And also because of Dwight too.
[on the phone with a client] I just wanted to check and see if there's anything you needed before I went on my maternity leave...  Yeah, I'm pregnant...  Great, well, I'll write up the order.  Okay, thanks.
So, detour. We're now adding Nashua to the Lecture Circuit so Michael can confront Holly and get some closure. Nashua actually sounded very excited on the phone. I don't think they get a lot of visitors. Because their office is only accessible by cross-country skis. Hey-oh! [laughs] [whispers] I've been driving too long.
Like, he used to make dogs fight? Or he actually fought dogs?
This is Michael, my boss. [she points] Justin.
Oh, you guys.  Just one second.  [picks up phone] Oh my gosh!  Are you serious?  Shipping emergency.  I don't think I can go to lunch.
It's awkward asking people for money, but we could really use it. Why doesn't Crate & Barrel let you register for a toaster full of cash?
Don't take this the wrong way, but... you should go for that job.
[talks over flashbacks] Kelly has been a handful in the past.
Oh- [both look at each other and together say] Thank you.
Hey Kev, guess what. I won an art contest today.
No, I mean, you're doing great, and Andy put you in charge of the whole party, right?
Michael's birthday was actually pretty cool. It was a good day. I don't know... It was a good day.
Yes, of course, we could've just been doing this the whole time, but SOMEONE dropped the ball.
Please stop saying what.  Can you take him?
Right? Thank you! It���s just Philly. Everyone���s acting like it���s New York or Paris or London.
[whispering] I���m so sorry. I hate this. You���re better.
Well, it doesn���t spin. We���ll just move the wheel one notch each morning and��� you see what chore you get that day.
Dressing up as somebody-I mean, when has that ever worked for you?
Why are you assuming you'd get the whole thing?
So it turns out Donna and I have a facebook friend of a friend in common, so I was able to see some of her pictures online. [pulls out picture of Donna embracing a man and smiling] This was taken two weeks ago. And this was taken the same night. [pulls out a picture of Donna kissing the same man] This photo was taken this morning. [shows a baby picture] It's Cece. [laughs] She's never gonna do anything wrong.
Well, he seems really happy being back here at Dunder Mifflin.
She's sweet and cute. I thought you'd get along.
This could be real. Dwight's pretty handy with computers. He fixed my laptop once.
Do you want me to ask where you're going?
[singing] Just smile for me and let the day begin.  You are the sunshine that lights my heart within... on the wings of love ...
[Breaks Roy's grip] No, I don't want to go, I don't want to.
Mm-hmm.  Yes, I'm fine.  Um, yeah, the doctor said it's still considered a minor contraction as long as I can talk through it.
You can't, I locked the office from the inside when we left.
So, imagine like the real estate version of Michael Scott and that was this guy. He did half the interview as Ace Ventura.
Yeah, I mean, admitting you need help is the first step!
Well, we won���t be late. I love you, mom. Thanks.
You have a guitar slung on your back. I did not know you played guitar.
I know you Michael, I saw you naked.
So many memories in this old gym. Pretending I have PMS so I didn't have to play volleyball, pretending I have PMS so I didn't have to play basketball. Those were the days!
[stands up; gets into stance] Okay wait-- it's-- you're saying it comes from the foot.
[imitating Cookie Monster] 'Hey, Erin, You look delicious. I mean, beautiful.'
[leans over toward Erin] Um, hit the speakerphone button. The speakerphone button? The same button as you hit before... or sit on it.
[taking paper from Kevin] Oh that's mine! Um, I'll just, I'll get it out of the way for you.
[runs over after walking over fire coals] Hey! I want to say something. I've been trying to be more honest lately and I just need to say a few things. I did the coal walk! Just, I did it! Michael, you couldn't even do that.  Maybe I should be your boss? Wow, I feel really good right now.  Why didn't any of you come to my art show? I invited all of you.  That really sucked. It's like sometimes some of you act like I don't even exist.  [turns and looks directly at Jim] Jim, I called off my wedding because of you. And now we're not even friends.  And things are just like weird between us, and that sucks. And I miss you. You were my best friend before you went to Stamford, and I really miss you. I shouldn't have been with Roy. And there were a lot of reasons to call off my wedding. But the truth is, I didn't care about any of those reasons until I met you.  And now you're with someone else. And that's... fine. It's... whatever. That's not what... I'm not... Okay, my feet really hurt. The thing that I'm just trying to say to you, Jim... and to everyone else in this circle I guess, is that I miss having fun with you. Just you, not everyone in the circle. Okay, I am going to go walk in the water now. Yeah. It's a good day.
I just mean because you know us and you like observed us for ten years and I feel like he's- I just feel like...he's so into his work right now and....I don't know, am I crazy?
[sees it's a drawing of hers, framed] Wow. I didn't know you kept this.
[voicemail message for Jim] Calling from my cell phone.  I don't know if you guys figured out who did that to Michael's carpet yet, but I have a theory that involves an inter-departmental conspiracy.  Everybody in the office.  We need to talk.
Listen our credit card has been cancelled and we have to deal with that, and I really can't handle the fact that you're calling us here!
I don't think I'm asking for too much. I guess it's just the end of courtesy in the workplace.
[over phone] Yeah I'm fine.  Um... my cell phone battery's low, so I have to let you go.
Oscar, wait. I think the victory would be more meaningful if Erin puts the last word in herself.
[hesitating at the bribe] Yeah. You know what , I think I saw ONE sick day down there.
No, no, no, no, no.  Oh, no. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Nooooo!
Just let us open up the presents, Dwight.
Well, the promo for the documentary aired today.
He's not saying what he needs to say.
I wish we'd started this exercise six months ago. My heart just feels so... blocked up.
I have a way to make Scranton a better place, you could leave it.  [laughter]
Oh my gosh, thank you so much. But seriously, we don't want to bother you any more than we already have.
I don���t know, Jim -- maybe you should have been there.
You know what? It's fine, it's fine. Let me just...it's fine. [Pam leaves work bus]
Did I wake up this morning thinking I'd be throwing together a bird funeral?  You never can tell what your day here is  gonna turn into.
So now everyone hates Andy, and it's this whole mess, and I don't know what to do.
We should have hired a professional to take our mental pictures.
[clink of beer bottles] Beers? You closed it?
Kelly made me realize something.  She and I have... nothing in common.  And I need more friends.
Michael once told me that Home Alone is the saddest movie ever. When I asked him why, he said, 'Because the whole family forgets the kid at home. There is nothing funny about that.'
The thing about pregnancy is people treat you differently. Like you're a kid almost. They lose all sense of boundaries. They start acting weird, telling you things that clearly aren't true. I know it sounds nuts, but I think Dwight is the only one who's telling me the truth.
I should just go.  [accent]  Where to now Caleb?
Okay. [Jim and Pam hug] Good luck. You're gonna be great.
I don't think those were yours to take.
Is it funny? I thought it was more ...interesting, than funny. [she walks over to see Oscar at the window looking down on man catching a football in parking lot]  I think my water just broke!
Are you going to Angela's cat party on Sunday?
Yes, and there���s nothing you could say that would get me to run the slightest risk of losing it.
When Michael's skirting a phone call, he gave me a list of places to say he is. 'Stopping a fight in the parking lot. ' 'An Obama fashion show. ' Whatever... that is. Or 'trapped in an oil painting.' I'm gonna save that one.
I don't think you should go to Philly tonight. I think that you should stay and I think we should fight.
Oh... is there another wedding at the hotel this weekend?
No it was really it was really sweet. It was raining and..
Hey guys, we're all gonna visit Meredith at lunch. And we're kicking in $5 for flowers.
Well, you know... actually, I kind of need to stall a bit. But, it's okay, because I am very used to killing time.
I can't believe this. I mean I have never even stolen as much as a paperclip and you're firing me.
Oh my God, you guys, look. It's Recyclops.
Jim. Jim, Jim, Jim. I'm not threatening you. I love you. [whispers] But you should know, you're on very dangerous ground [kisses Jim]. [at normal volume] All right.
And looks so handsome in his UNIFORM! Please?
Wow. Thank you. Um, that must have been hard for you to relive that. Both of you.
Yes, Michael, new chairs. These chairs are terrible. We were supposed to get new ones last year.
Oh, all my stuff is still upstairs so...
Michael started the process of selecting a new chair about three weeks ago. And normally I wouldn't care, but he promised me his old one. It's way better. It's one of these. [makes a shrrhhh sound of a chair moving downward as Pam slumps down] I really want it.
We have maybe a month.  I don't know what I'm gonna do.
I still can't believe he didn't tell me.
You know, you're in a meeting, and nobody knows that you've had sex there, except for you and him.
What could Jim have said to make my dad want to leave my mom? And at what point in our marriage is he gonna say it to me?
I may have a few weeks ago faked a call from Jan in order to get out of a synopsis of, I think it was, Navy: NCIS. Since then, Michael's been suspicious.
Yes! I'm in a good mood today! I'm excited to meet all the new people and to see my old friend again, definitely. That's always a thing that makes people happy... to have an old friend back.
We have an extra outfit in the bag.
Say that I'm lying or say that I have the job. Make a definitive statement, Gabe.
[on phone] Look, I'm not going to tell you that we have lower prices. Is price something that is important to you? Ok, well let me know if anything changes.
Michael screened a work in progress for us, years ago, and it didn't go well. We thought it was a comedy. [flashback clip of Michael angrily leaving the conference room while the whole office is laughing at the tv] Everything pointed to it being a comedy.
Here's the story. That guy in there is Jim's childhood friend, Tom.
[giggling] Oh, wow. Funny. It's after my grandfather.
Yeah, I changed them to your new address.
Roy has a connection. It's nicer than you think.
I'm kind of in-between boyfriends right now. So I don't need anything sexy. But I do need some new hand towels. I figure I can cut up this robe.
So, Stacy and Eric get to Bogre's DeTech half an hour early so they don't have to sit on the slab.
The unfair thing about working in sales is that your salary is almost all commission. So, you suck at sales, you make almost no money. I guess that's fair.
Oh, yeah, no. Don't worry about it. I mean, he was being ridiculous.
There is no rush to get to the hospital.  I am fine.  I'll get there.  And if I don't get there, I don't get there.
That's good. [Michael continues to play conch shell]
I'm having contractions, but they're irregular and far apart.  So I'm not really in labor, I'm near labor.
[Nate starts walking away from hornet's nest, puts down the blowtorch] Yes!
Maybe it���s a list of people he���s gonna fire.
Yes, you clean all the mugs in the sink.
I'm kidding around.  We joke about that stuff all the time.  I'm not really the jealous type, so, I don't care if Jim sees Karen.  I care a little.
[outside, on cell phone] How could you do this to me? He's my boss! How many times have I complained about him to you? No, I am not being dramatic, you are being crazy!
I hate the idea that someone out there hates me. I even hate thinking that Al-Qaeda hates me. I think if they got to know me, they wouldn't hate me. But Karen knows me, and she still hates me, so...
So. I've been thinking, after we win the lottery, we take our winnings....
What possible explanation could you have for possibly being here? I don't... you know, babies shouldn't have ice cream, by the way.
Oh, okay, uh, sorry, guys.  Just, um, keep talking.
My fiance has plans for us this Saturday.  So I really hope that Dwight doesn't make me work. Maybe I should sleep with him? I'm kidding, kidding. Totally kidding.
OK. [to Darryl] Do you know the plate... never mind. Why would you know that? And why would I be asking that?
I know. But we should go. We need to thank him for, you know, saving my life.
Yes. But don't get too excited, 'cause I didn't have a lot of time this year.
Yeah. I think you should call social services.
And it is so cute how she signs her name.
Ok. Um, a fisherman is walking down Fifth Avenue walking an animal behind him-
No, not like a ham. It's about doing something, so that the person knows that you really care about her.
Well I'm having my baby first, so that's that.
Yeah, I wanted to show you something in the lobby. Come on.
Well, I mean, it's an iPod. But ..
Well, the last pick-up for overnight deliveries is at seven. So you need to have them signed by then. Or much earlier.
Yeah. Um, do you have any other pictures of Astrid?
I am. You should come dance with us.
They're considering him for a top secret mission. There's his application. Oh, and this is where I made him list every secret he promised he'd never ever tell.
Oh, that wasn't the night crew. That was Dwight.
[to Jim] Hey! You can just give her your extension.
Okay. I'm talking to this woman at daycare...
What do we know about this bird?  You might think, 'Not much.  It's just a bird.'  But we do know some things.  We know it was a local bird.  Maybe it's that same bird that surprised Oscar that one morning with a special present from above.
Michael, let me make this very easy for you, I could give a sh[beep] about your happiness!  Stop dating my mother!
Honestly, I think you should go easy on her.
Mom, I'm sorry. I know you and Dad are chipping in for the wedding but I do not want orange invitations. Yes! Well, if you really want my...
[Pam and Meredith singing karaoke] This one's for all you ladies out there.
Well, he could still... I'm sorry about that... Oh could I just get you to sign this second page.
You can't be a part of our relationship, Michael.
I haven't heard anything, but I bet Jim got the job.  I mean, why wouldn't he?  He's totally qualified, and smart, everyone loves him... and, if he never comes back again... that's OK.  We're friends.  And I'm sure we'll stay friends.  We just, we never got the timing right.  You know?  I shot him down, and then he did the same to me, and...  But you know what?  It's OK.  I'm totally fine.  Everything is gonna be totally--- [Jim walks in]
You know Oscar every time I make this lasagna people ask me if it's a family recipe, but really, I just get the recipe from the box!
Nope, and we're gonna need a loaves and fishes kind of miracle to feed 'em all.
I know. It's totally going to change the way I work out.
That means another twelve weeks.  [pause] Can you do this for another three months?
Kelly really likes to online shop.  Soooo, I felt like I wanted some new clothes.  I mean, I just, I wanted to, it just, I felt like it was time, to maybe um... just get new clothes.
I really like Valentine's Day in this office. It's kinda like grade school. Everybody gives out little presents and stuff. Like last year, Jim gave me this card, with Dwight's head on it, it was horrifying and funny and...
It's okay, honey. [Philip cries] It's okay, it's okay.
[Michael comes out with Vikram, arms raised] We got Vikram!
Ok, well, we're going to a bar. Hey. You have to come to stuff with me. I'm serious! If you're going to be my boyfriend, you have to do boyfriend things.
No, I don't know what the future holds, but... I'm optimistic.  And, uh, I had fun goofing around with Dwight today.  Jim and I... are just... too similar.  Maybe one day I'll find my own Karen. But--- you--- that is, a, um, you know, not--- A man.  A man version.  But, uh, until then... I can hold my head up. ... I'm not gay.
[laughs] You're very quick on your feet. I remember you. Funny.
She said everything with the wedding goes by so fast we should try to take mental pictures of the high points.
A little smile and a nod shows that I hear you. Got it?
Just listen. Remember that casino night about a month before we were supposed to get married? I kissed Jim.
If you wanna do something for the funeral...
I didn't see where it started but I saw where it ended.
Um... but hey? Something kind of cool. There's this internship in graphic design that Jan was telling us about. She made it sound, like, really great.
Just like no big reason. Just a bunch of little reasons.
Well count yourself lucky. Wait until you have two. That's two sleep schedules, two naps that don't coincide, I mean, you'll never sleep again.
Remember yesterday when we were terrified of being parents?
Well, a gay man would not leave the store wearing those shoes!
Hey, have I told you you look really nice today?
0-1-7-5. Thank you. Bye, bye. [to Michael] It really makes us look unprofessional.
Down.  You have to sit down so I can get the full effect.
So, what do you say we get started?
Oh, thank you! I don't know why I doubted it, because I'm so clearly awesome!
When I get eight hours, compared to like six hours, like, big difference.
Look at the huge offices Jim, check out that conference room.
Oh, yeah. I'm more than alright. There's just nothing to celebrate.
Yeah... [they see Erin eating in her car, and ducking when they see her. Pam knocks on her car window] Hey, Erin, everything okay?
So Jim and I are getting married and the wedding's really expensive.  So I tried to get a job on the weekends to earn extra money.  I applied to Old Navy, Target and Wal-mart.  None of 'em called me back.  Not even for an interview.
That's cool. [opens the container and smells the tiramisu] Mm, good stuff. [throws it in the garbage]
[voicemail message for Jim] Hey, what's that word we made up when you have a thing stuck in your shoe?  Anyway, I have a thing stuck in my shoe.
[Ryan and Kelly make out in the nook] But she's had a bad influence. She's like an addict. [Ryan and Kelly argue] And I just had to get her clean.
Because I just wanted a relaxing evening at home...
Don't act like you understood anything that guy said. [pat's Jim's arm] Good luck, wingman. [salutes]
No, normal women don't do stuff like that. This is bad. [Karen nods and Michael looks like he's about to start crying]
Um, Jim, please, please, please, I think it'd be weird if you did it.
Yeah, I gave him a ride home because...
Yeah, I'd love to see them. Oh, and tell them I say, 'Congratulations.'
Oh right, okay. Hey Stanley, it's great to see you!
I wouldn't go if things weren't so solid with Jim. And down the road, if we have a family, I couldn't go then either. So, the timing's perfect... And that is the first time I've ever used the word 'perfect' in here!
Uh, I'm sorry Andy, but this is a closed club.
No, you should have her mom do the boring Christmas stuff on her time. You should be associated with the fun parts of Christmas.
Hey, Dwight, um, my friend is kinda into these two girls that he works with.
...I feel like we should go get Kevin something. Do you think we can sneak out of here?
Jim is really talented. And he should be the one who's getting a better job offer. Like, for real.
Yes, Jim, I think I know how to point a rectangle at something.
Michael, you need to get out of this.
Ummm. Oh! I'll say he's related to Richard Nixon. It's an inside joke. He looks really Nixon-y when he wakes up.
A delivery guy will deliver a box of pens, and you just make sure everything���s in order.
Everyone, Let���s take our picture in front of the mural. Oh, um, I just���I kind of meant just everybody from the office.
Yeah���turn signal. It's exciting to be painting again���those are the wipers. So���the���its���just. There you go! Yeah. [chuckles]  Yeah, things get so busy with the kids���red light���that it's nice to have that creative outlet���red light! Red light! Red! Red!
No! No, I���m interested. I mean I think everybody���s interested in why they have to sing it.
[everyone yelling at Pam]You guys, I am so sorry! It's just been so chaotic with Jim gone, that...
Right here. Little Michael Scott- [points to her belly]
Have you ever had a conversation with Kelly where she didn't go on for 15 minutes without taking a breath?
I literally cannot wait to see what Dwight has planned.  And I wish Jim were here.
Whoa, that's kind of condescending. Would you say something like that to Jim?
I actually might not go. Feeling kind of tired.
Here's a suggestion computer.  I assume you read binary so why don't you zero one one, one one one one, zero one one zero one one.
I don't think we registered anywhere. We just want cash.
Kevin, you cannot possibly save enough time to see the world.
I forgot what a super, nice girl Katy is. And just... good for Jim! They are so cute together. And, um, what an adorable car.
I mean, help, if it's something simple, like add page numbers or laminate it or...
If I knew I had a week to live, I would... probably go to Europe. And South America. And the Grand Canyon. And... I would want to see the Pacific Ocean. ...It would be a pretty busy week.
Let's see. Andy has been manager for a hundred and five days. Which means I've heard 'Closing Time' a hundred and five times. [nods and shakes head] Still don't know the words. Tah wa Ta way hm hm home and home and home.
Shut up Oscar.  What is wrong with all of you, he is sleeping with my mother!
I told you, I have the number that rings here. Do you want that number?
I have so many people to thank for this award.
Oh. Hey how about at Thanksgiving we prank Tom about being bald?
No, I know, like, I kind of like, I thought that maybe you did when I first started.
Hon, I wish you would have told me an hour ago, when you knew you weren���t gonna make it.
Hey Michael!  I have a present for you, but you have to come down and get it.
Pretty crazy about Andy and Michelle Obama, huh?
Hey Meredith, I need your supplier requests today.
Yes, he bowled 5 frames with this pink sparkly thing until a little girl had to ask for her ball back.
I-- I thought they were confused at least...
Forget everything we taught you.  Hey, Jan! It���s so great to see you.
[imitating Deangelo's pretend juggling routine] Look.  I'm juggling eggs and bowling balls.  I'm juggling with one hand.  No hands.
He's a big Meryl Streep fan, so I shouldn't be surprised that he's identified with her character.
I don't know. I try not to bother him about this kind of stuff.
I'm the office administrator now, which means I'm basically being paid to be head of the party planning committee. The first thing I did as head... I shut it down. At its best it was a toxic political club used to make others feel miserable and left out. At its best it planned parties.
And get your flu shot. Also, I'm going to set up hand sanitizing stations around the office.
Why aren't there any beans on this very old, frizzy-haired picture of me?
[to Cece] Hm. Don't listen to her. She's just jealous 'cause she doesn't get to come home to someone as cute as you.
And we're also supposed to speak our truths.
Here here! Speech, speech, speech, speech [other people start joining in]
Oh my God, Meredith what are you doing!?
I feel like he���s always making these decisions for the family, and then I���m left playing catch-up.
[with Jim, holding the baby]  She's incredible.  Want to count her fingers and toes again?
I can't get a fire pit. I have two babies.
I'm not - I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that.
Yeah. Painting now. I just want to make sure that...
I feel bad about what I wrote on the bathroom wall.
Okay. I'd never heard that before. So, thank you.
Because we're usually not on the same page.
Yeah, it was great because it was like you're supposed to be working, but nothing ever gets done.
Why is there a circle with a line through it?
I can't do this. I had a real job. I sat ten feet away from my fiance. I had health benefits. I was just feeling impulsive. I should have gotten a tiny tattoo on my ankle.
I���m kidding! Oh my gosh you guys! She���s obviously super cute I get it. But I���d like to point out there���s 50 pounds more of me to love if that���s your thing.
I'm not asking if you're in to her. Just, objectively, do you find her attractive?
I've really been putting in the hours on this mural. And my boss is totally OK with it, because he's in the Bahamas and has no clue what anybody is doing. I'm usually very self-critical. I hate what I paint. But, I don't know, this time I feel like it's, um, it's really coming together... [sees mural] Oh my god! [camera pans to mural with butts painted over it] Wha? You've gotta be kidding me! What it... are those... are those butts? [to warehouse crew] Huh? No way. No way!
I don't think it would be the worst thing if they let me go because then I might... I don't think it's many little girls' dream to be a receptionist. I like to do illustrations. Um... Mostly watercolor. A few oil pencil. Um, Jim thinks they're good.
Darryl, oh, my gosh. How is Austin? Tell me everything. How���s the merger? I feel like I read about Athlead all the time.
Because I got it at Blockbuster and they don't put the pictures on the box.
Um, did my dad say anything about my mom?
So you invested ten thousand dollars to look like a team player?
You had a nice meal with your girlfriend in a lovely place...
[on the phone] No, no, I know that the warranty's expired, but isn't it supposed to last longer than two years if it isn't defective? OK, fine, three years.
Senator Lipton helped me submit my design for a new mural on a building downtown. Now I���m just waiting to hear from the selection committee. But, you know, let���s be realistic. There are a ton of great artists in Scranton with way more experience. I mean, who are they gonna go with -- some nobody like me or a big name like Tracy Fleeb?
Jan called and asked where you're going to meet for dinner.  She wants you to call her.
I saw it.  I saw it, and it was amazing!  Who said I didn't see it?  Did Jim say that I didn't see it? I saw it!
Okay, well, I just sorta meant, like, cute, right?
Yeah, he tried to set up my TIVO for me but then I didn't have audio for a week.
Okay, well she takes her convictions pretty seriously, she can be kind of severe.
[voicemail message for Jim] Hey, guess what?  I moved my computer so I can't see Michael's head.  It's working.  I think I can have a career as a very specific type of decorator.
Here's the thing.  When Michael invents a hypothetical situation, he eventually turns it into an actual situation.
No. No no no! [nos coming from all employees]
No no no, don't. I will go talk to Angela.
No.  No, but I'm allowing it.  Just come here.
Well, I mean, How do you pay back someone for something like that? But, uh, I don���t know. I���m working on something.
Anyway, we also have a special on envelopes.
I don't think Jim cares about his hair.
Okay, Dwight, but if you do need a key, just listen it's under the...
No no no no no! She'll wake up!
[pulling her new shirt out of a box] Ok.
Hi dad. Yeah Jim has shaving cream, check our bathroom.
Do you like it? It's a photo of everyone in the office. So you can take it to Costa Rica.
Dwight just listen!  It's underneath...  [Dwight hangs up as the policeman hands him a ticket]
Uh, yes.  Please have a seat. It'll be a few minutes.
Why don't you use the microwave in the kitchen, Phyllis?
And we move to the south of France. See? No, there's plenty of bicycling for you. I think that's where they do the Tour de France.
And we'll make sure Dwight doesn't do anything C-R-A-Z-Y.
It's my first day back after maternity leave. And I miss Cece, of course. But we need the money. What was maternity leave like? Oh, how do I explain it?... It rocked. It rocked my ass off.
Is it a good message or a bad message?
So Santa, what can we expect from this party?
Oh, wow. I forgot how pretty your house is.
Oh, cause it was upside down. [both laugh]
I don't think you love Smokey Robinson. I think you're just doing all of this to prove how deep you are about music
Yeah, I think the pregnancy really brought us together.
Well, um, you can scan it, and then you can upload the image, and then you can copy the new image.
Because they have a great design program, and I wanted to see if I was any good at it. And I wanted to work on my art, too.
The day's going fine. It's been a little chaotic but it's fine. It's great! A lot of distractions. But, it's good.
No, I got the teacher introducing them and then the applause afterwards. But not so much of the middle part.
Ah, yeah. We haven't told anybody, but it's going really great. [looks at Jim] Right?
[Jim bows to Pam; she bows back] Thank you.
Oh, my God.  His letter of recommendation from Rick Santorum is three fifty-dollar bills.
Unless someone very close to us is in immediate physical danger, you should not be calling us.
Yeah.  Dwight, Michael wants to see you in his office. [Dwight runs in]
Yeah, whatever. [Jim holds up the card] [Pam laughs] Give it to me. Give it to me.
It's kind of like that lip thing she did last night, like a half snarl, half smile? I get the sense that she's very ironic.
No, really, it's okay. I know that Jim had, like a crush on me when he first started. But that was a long time ago, so.
[her text tones rings] Dwight stopped the device!
Because some people think you monopolize the conversation by trying to be funny.
How far away does she live now, like ten minutes?
[opens up her present] Oh, my god! Thank you very much, Santa, whoever you are. It's awesome.
[looks at list] When did you add this to the list?
That's okay I can... I'm fine. I'll just play a song in my head.
Right... you're a sports writer in Philadelphia? Nice build too.
I'm just gonna go home. My mom's been watching the kids all day.
[to Dwight, who is reading the want ads] Should you really be so blatant about that?
My Mom is coming in to visit. And she lives like two hours away. And she doesn't have a cell phone... which is cool cause it's kind of adding some suspense to my day. And I keep looking over at the door hoping she'll walk in.
Why was he making her laugh so much?
A few months ago. I was talking to someone at corporate, who isn't there anymore, and I think the paperwork just got lost in the shuffle. Can you believe that?
You know the baby's not going to live here, right?
Uh, we brought back some Puerto Rican candy.
Yeah, but in a jokey way where you're gonna start singing.
Listen, are you bringing anyone to Jim's party tonight?
Uh, just off the top... I think she'll be here this afternoon.
Have you heard anything about any secret office romances?
Okay, weirdo.  Come on.  It's time for cake.
But have you ever actually seen him yourself?
Okay, I'm not going.  I'm not...  It's fine.   [Jim, Michael and Kevin try to help her up] Okay, come on, come on.  No!  I am not going!  I am not going, okay!?  I'm not going today because I can't do it, I don't think I can do it.
No, Stacy is a boy.  Ugh.  Frustrating.  Why can't you just be in art class with me?
Yeah. He works here. We all know him.
OK. New topic. Kelly, how are things with Ryan?
No, I met his wife in Mommy and Me. They're a great couple. You should meet them later.
Wow, there are, there are questions to that. Okay. Um, you know what, no questions. Last item on the agenda, Toby would like to make an announcement.
[shouts] Michael Scott, are you still seeing Donna?
No, this was the one thing I was supposed to be able to control, was this veil and-- [Jim cuts off half his tie]
So when do I get to hear everything? Are you still getting unpacked or... you want to grab a coffee or something after work?
[exiting the Ladies' room] Mine too. [Pam and Jim notice the Handicapped stall and walk towards it.  Putting their ears to the door they hear Mr. and Mrs. Vance being intimate]
Yeah, I've seen that with my kids. Um, it is tiny, but I've actually been commissioned by the City of Scranton to paint a mural-
OK. Dwight. Are you really in charge of picking the health care plan?
It's just good to stop a Michael train of thought early before it derails and destroys the entire town.
Oh, hey, Jim. Wait, stop. Um, I'm sorry... for pushing you towards Cumberland. Seriously, if you left here, I would blow my brains out.
If you don't take out his battery, he just keeps going all day.
[On phone] Oh, great! Yeah, um, I'll get right back to you. [hangs up] Hey guys! Anyone ever heard of Iris Black on the radio?
After I had my little outburst at the beach, Jim was really nice about it. He just basically said that he missed my friendship too and I would always mean a lot to him and I understand where he's coming from.  For the record, I am not embarassed at all. It needed to be said, and I said it, and it only took me three years to summons the courage, so [quietly, and mock bowing] thank you.
Movie Monday started with training videos, but we went through those pretty fast.  Then we watched a medical video.  Since then, it's been half hour installments of various movies, with the exception of an episode of Entourage, which Michael made us watch six times.
And, I haven't gotten paid yet. I'm not blaming you.
[smiles] Go ahead.  I think it's your turn.
Maybe. But it sounds like you're just wrong for each other.
Yeah, I guess. I mean, I kinda liked my old desk mate.
This is a ridiculously awful plan. Because you cut everything.
Andy that's way too personal of a question.
I'm sure no one asked you to do that.
What's that come to? Like, what did they each win?
Do you think you could work from this? [showing Tattoo artist sketch pad] we made some small adjustments.
Okay.  So, I'm just not sure if I'm releasing, though.  I'm not sure if...
You're right, you're right. I'm a middle class broad. [Jim does his 'Jim face']
[to Jim] Go up and check on him. He's upset.
I want us to make it. I want a fresh start.
Would any of you be saying any of this if the cupcakes were from Supermart?
Ready! [flips sketch pad showing tattoo possibilities] ���I���m not as think as you drunk I am!��� [crowd claps and cheers]
Thank you. Really you guys thank you. Very sweet.
[on the phone] Hey, hey! Where are you?  Can you take Andy to the hospital?
Oh, okay. Everyone, remember, when he get's like this, he will wallow, if you empathize. Keep conversations light and if you get stuck, and you don't know what to do, make a random sound effect okay? Farting noise, whatever. Okay.
Oh... God.  Oh my God, he's gonna jump.
Oh, I know.  We talked about it and he told me.
Good. We watched a video about our changing bodies.
Good morning, Mr. Wonka, here are your messages.
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. [makes 'talking' gesture with her hand]  Jim, come on, we gotta get in there and practice.  Okay?  I'm not kidding!
No, I���m not upset. I���m really excited for Darryl��� Maybe I���m a little disappointed that we���ll be losing him.
Jim, I got us that dinner reservation. Grico���s at 7:30.
We'll find another receptionist. I mean, that's easy. We'll be fine. [Andy nods reluctantly]
Ladies, are we prepared to let the Kevins of the world decide anything for us? Anything at all? We don't even give him full internet access.
Oscar and the warehouse guy! Go Oscar! Go gay warehouse guy!
So���what do you make of this Robert California guy? I mean, what does a guy like that do on an average weeknight?
[Pam nods head] You should say hi. Use her full name.
Yes, I have been working with you forever.
Mmmm, that sounds great.  What are you thinking?
Yeah, it turns out I was, um, just grasping at straws.
I don't want to look at your friend Jasmine's boobs all day.
During the course of business, a copier goes though something called 'Normal wear and tear.'
Oh... um... no.  That's... um... That's actually fine
Yes, it is The Island Luau Inventory '07. It's actually a success compared to Disco Audit '05.
Do you have any leads on a job?
What? [Jim shakes his head] Did you want to tell me something? You look like you want to tell me something. [Jim shakes his head no] You look like you have something really important to say and you just can't for some reason. [Jim smiles] Come on, you can tell me. Jim, you can tell me anything. [Jim stops smiling and looks down. Pam wonders what that means]
Michael, it's time for the suggestion box meeting.
Nobody's going to prison, okay? Um... all right, Michael, you need to convince Jo to go easy on us. And then we'll all confess once we know our jobs are safe.
No, it's horrible!  Jim, she might get arrested.
Andy, did I dream that you were crying through the night?
Maybe I played a little in junior high... and in high school... maybe a little in college... and went to volleyball camp most summers.
I know we're having that harassment thing this afternoon.
Oh, well, thanks Oscar.  I was just wondering how would you feel if Michael was sleeping with your mom?
Stop texting, put your phone away!  Come on.
[Pam���s phone vibrates] Oh, text from Jim. ���This is getting very weird. Will explain later.���
[looking at Cece's diaper] Somebody needs a change.
Angela, you have to put a stop to this right now.
I find that hard to believe... considering you have problems with every single person in this entire office except Bobblehead Joe.
[to Jim] I'm sorry, I'm leaving you alone for lunch.
Do you want me to ask the cleaning crew if they stopped watering it?
There's an HR meeting in there at 11:30.
Did I?  Doesn't sound like me, not very superstitious.
Hey, Angela. I got good news today too. I won an art contest.
Uh, just one second.  We're in a meeting and I'll see if he's available.  It's Jan.
I know that I shouldn't have done it. But I was in the parking lot at the Quick and Easy.
Meredith...  [copier has an error] Oh... so uh... G-44.  It's not ready Kevin!
You know what would go so great with this cabbage pie? Milk.
Good. Very good. [cell phone beeping]Oh���no! Here. It's, uh, a text from Andy. ���New special proj. Need fam tree for evbody. Really dig up dirt A.S.A.P.��� And then in parentheses, he wrote out ���as soon as possible.���
He is in my room icing his balls.
I don���t know, but it might take me a long time to figure it out.
Well, I feel like she needs to eat, but she won't latch on, which is weird, because the other baby di...
Is there a volume knob on that thing?
Sometimes we're so excited we forget where we are. Like at a business meeting.
[into phone] Hello, this is Pam Halpert. I���m calling from Dunder-Mifflin. Yes, your paper provider. And I just called to say... your mama is so fat, when she wears red, people yell, ���Hey, kool-aid.��� Yeah, your mama���s fat. This is Pam Halpert.
Oh no, don't, don't, don't, don't. [Michael laughs] Aah! [laughs, then leaves] Okay...
Oh Angela, those brownies have walnuts in them and I think Kevin's allergic to walnuts. You're allergic to walnuts, right Kevin?
[in a car with Andy, by the dumpster you can see a new computer box] So listen, we have to really scuff this up.
I kind of forced you to do it.
Yes, I invested in WUPHF. It's actually a great idea and I can't believe it didn't exist before. And I know Ryan's kind of a sketchy guy, but hey, I married Jim. I've done my part for the nice guy. Now I want a bedroom set.
And when they were both in the third grade, Jim was placed in the top reading group.
Seriously? This is what's so important, putting naked pictures on the desktop?
[reads memo] 'Sleeves down to the wrists, buttoned-up collars, and muted colors.' Nobody dress like that. [camera pans over to Angela]
Well we all wanted to plan your goodbye party. We thought this would be easier.
Yeah. Yeah, I mean I could have used another week, or three.
[in car] Hey, my aunt told me something neat.
I ran into this guy from my high school who has just gotten divorced and he hit on me. In the mall. And I didn't tell you because, I don't know, I felt embarrassed. And, I didn't know if you would be mad or worried. But, anyway, I thought you'd want to know.
Yeah, Jim barely talks to Mike. We had to go through like two levels of friends to even find his profile. Jim picked someone just unattractive enough to shut me up without tipping it.
Yeah I did a watercolor of Frances Willard Elementary School for a contest they were having. They were calling with the results. And I won. I won! My painting won. So I like to thank my mom for always encouraging me. And I like to thank my dad for buying me my first set of art pencils. And I'd like to thank the sixth grade class that picked me.
Look at her. Even I want some fries with that shake.
Well, she can't bring this up with her.
Ok.  There's a transcript between a naval ship-
Yes. In my top three, so suck it.
So, it really is just about the cupcakes.
Dwight's health care memo. I told you about it.
Sales people can go later in the day. Hourly works can go at lunch.
So apparently no one dresses up for Halloween here. I wish I had known that before I used greasepaint for my moustache. And I can't even take off my hat, because then I'm Hitler.
And then every morning, I'd walk out on to my terrace and I would breathe in the inspiration of the city. You know? And just gather ideas for my painting...
Whoa, Toby.  Watch out.  You're going to violate your own PDA memo.
Exactly. That should tell you how terrible the chairs are.
One of the hardest parts about making resolutions is keeping them. In fact, most resolutions are abandoned by February.
[lifting up a diamond bracelet] Oh, my God.
[through phone] It's been so long since I've been with adults. I am so excited to see everybody. Creed, Ryan. Oh my God, Stanley! Stanley's going to be there. Yes, oh my God!
You shouldn't be fired. I mean, you were just protecting me.
She's talking about the handprints that celebrities make in the cement.
[to delivery men] Uh, hi, can I help you? I don't think anyone here-
Actually, the distractions are good.  I mean, I don't think I'm going to make it until midnight if I'm just sitting here thinking about it.
So place it on the infinity thing without being obvious, you know? I'd love to do like a color version just to bring a little color to the logo.
If you propose to me during a Michael meeting, I will say no.
I know.  Isn't that always how it goes?
Dwight, stop. I'm not kidding, I mean, I need you to take care of yourself. What would we do if something happened to you?
No. My goodness. You have a lot going on. With Robert and everything.
Yes, Jim���s friend is starting anew company based on this idea Jim had when they were back in college.
They���re the ones who put a fish tank next to a basketball hoop. It���s like if I put a glass of milk on the edge of the table and Cece knocks it over, I don���t blame Cece.
That's not bad. Hey, do you do weddings?
You're- You know your assistant told me that you have a big pitch meeting today. With Ryan Howard. How did that happen?
It's OK. You know what they say, a change is as good as a rest.
Right, and if you're interested in the way more fun party, all the info can be found here on our more brightly colored flyer. [Angela rips down brightly colored flyer and walks away. Karen rips down Angela's flyer.]
Okay, everyone, I've tallied the votes, and the winner... of the costume celebration spectacular... and the Scranton Wilkes-Barre coupon book... Oscar Martinez.
[to Michael] You're gonna wanna look at the date on that.  Oh, wow. Look at... golfing. [to Donna] Are you a golfer?
[sits down] Oh my gosh, I have been chasing people down all day.  It's incredible.
I���m training a temp to be my replacement while I���m on maternity leave. Oh I should���ve mentioned I���m pregnant. You probably didn���t notice because it���s impossible to tell I���m so small. But yeah I���m pregnant. [another squeak] Oh come on!
Ok [squeaking sound] Oh that was just me. Pregnant Pam. And I make sounds much worse than this.
So, mom... which birthday are we celebrating this year?
No, it doesn't have to just be cow stuff, right?
Oh, okay, Michael, slow down. Everything's gonna be okay.
Yeah, yeah, but I uh... I switched stuff around because I actually needed like more room for organization. So...
I'm a woman. I would want to know.
We invited everyone in the office to our wedding.  Even though we realized most people wouldn't be able to make the drive to Niagara Falls.  [whispers] Which is why we're having it in Niagara Falls.  [normal volume] Then Michael told everyone they could have Friday and Monday  off, if they came.  So now, people have to decide if they want to come to our wedding or have to work.
We decided that there's no way Dwight would harm a child.
[walking in with a tray of six popcorn bags] Popcorn anyone?
What do I think? I think everybody should stay out of everybody's personal business!
Good. Good. And���[Nellie hits the car against the bushes]
So what are you going to get me instead?
I have doubts about this too. But when one person freaks out, sometimes it weirdly makes the other one calmer. That's one thing I've learned about relationships. I hate that I just used the word relationship. [Michael comes out in a suit] Hey! You look great! [checks something off her list] Let's go!
I've decided to show her around. She really wants to meet everybody.
Well what was I supposed to do, let you walk all over me?
We are expecting a water delivery today at 10am. What if, as they���re delivering the water jugs, someone screams out, ���Nice jugs���?
Remember, you were gonna get a new chair, and you were gonna give your old chair to me. Remember that?
Hey, Cece, Daddy���s gonna have dinner with us tonight after he comes to your recital. Are you excited?
When was the last time you went to the doctor?
Hey! Our baby was not a mistake. She was a surprise.
250 dollars is nothing to the world's biggest Smokey Robinson fan.
That sucked. He didn't apologize. There's no talking to that guy.
We're all in it, from like years and years ago. It's like a home movie.
Ahh!  I'm sorry, I didn't, I didn't see you come in.
I won't. It's just that last night is really hard for me to remember because I was just a teensy bit high. Should I have not said that?
Yes! They're the only two gay guys I know. But they should be together.
Wrong baby!  This is not our baby!  Sshh.
Nope. Scared of getting cut in half. Also, there's pee on the floor.
Maybe. I just ...I don't really have anyone to go with.
I got Erin a new computer, because the one at reception sucked. I should know. And I don't wanna say the other one was old, but its I.P. number is one! [laughs sheepishly] Right?
Dunder Mifflin this is Pam. Oh, hey Mom. No, what did Dad say?
I'm sure she's just confused. People scratch their heads when they're confused. Not always like an ape, the way Meredith just did, but it happens.
If I get you a slice of pizza, are we even?
Okay focus. Focus.  You're in the right building, you're with the right people; what happened?
No, not... we're not... we're not having problems. But it is personal. And I would love...
Yeah, that's weird. I thought they only played the Police.
Get the keys out of my purse, start the car. [Jim and Pam slowly back out of the office, Pam has her weapon trained on everyone and then they run out]
Okay. [picks up and reads sheet]  The Michael Scott Foundation is still in existence?
Every time Michael's in a meeting, he makes me come in and give him a Post-It note telling him who's on the phone. I did it once, and he freaked out. He loved it so much. The thing is he doesn't get that many calls. So he has me make them up every 10 minutes.
Well, this building isn't far, and its much newer. There's a dry cleaner, nail place and a gym. Oh, and it's next-door to and Outback so it always smells like steak.
There's no one from England, Jim.  Katie studied in Ireland - this is Stacy, the one who does the Murakami-style collages.
Hey, Michael, why don't you just get down.
Okay. Sorry. We'll uh, we'll leave you alone.
See all this like old stuff, like um, there's that shot of Jim and I up on the roof?
Ladies and gentlemen, I think we have a winner.
Oscar, Toby, and I are founding members of the Finer Things Club.  We meet once a month to discuss books and art, celebrate culture in a very civilized way.  Sometimes the debate can get heated, but we're always respectful.  There is no paper, no plastic, and no work talk allowed.  It's very exclusive.
And then, remember, we went shopping the next day to buy me a washer and dryer?
I'm coming back the wrong way.  [smiles at Jim across the parking lot] It's not because of you.  I don't like graphic design. That's it. [laughs] Stop smiling. I really didn't like it.  It's just designing logos and stuff.... and I miss Scranton.  But it is not because I missed you. I just really wanted to come home... and I know you said to come home the right way, but you can't tell me what to do. Got it?
Or have them sing that song! That the frog does in Looney Tunes.
Hey, hey, guys. Wait. Before we accept these cupcakes, I think we need to have a conversation privately in the conference room. Don't eat the cupcake.
For the record, I wanted go another direction. Which was way better.
No, no, it's not a big deal, please. No. Um, Meredith can I get you something special while I'm at the store, candy, or...or one of those stylish turbans?
Sure.  There's a transcript between a naval ship and a lighthouse.
They have new phone systems now that can ring directly to a salesman, or someone presses star and they go to accounting, basically 95% of my job.  But I'd like to see a machine that puts out candy for everyone. [realizing] Vending machine.
So you have an office and a workspace?
It's fine.  Erin, you're going to go.  And you're going to make sure Michael tells the truth.
No, no, it's fine. Just gimme a second.
Well, I'm gonna say something to the producers.
No, I���m familiar with spinning. It���s just that wouldn���t work with a chore wheel because people might get the same chore-
Police are a hassle. We settled this on the street.
Hey, Erin. Do you mind faxing this for me?
Hey!  [gets up to greet Helene] Hey. Happy birthday.
Wait! What you should do, Michael, is have a doctor take a look at it. Because we really don't know what that is.
I don't think an apology is enough. I really think the only way for me to learn my lesson is to take my suspension.
Hmm... yeah.  Listen Michael.  Have you really thought this through?  'Cause it's a pretty big risk.
Never underestimate the power of a good night's sleep.
Thanks.  My costume's getting a lot of attention. [Pam is dressed as Charlie Chaplin]
[looks over at Oscar, who is quietly watching this happen] I hope... you have a very beautiful wedding, Angela.
You didn't happen to bring any coffee, did you, Michael?
[laughs] I don't know. I think Michael has a date.
But the warehouse coffee tastes SO much better.
Merry Christ--[looks up] NO! Why... why did you bring that here?
Dwight mercy killed Angela's cat.  It's very complicated.  It's caused a lot of unpleasantness between Dwight and Angela.  Who are both already prone to unpleasantness.
So what did you want to show me?
I don't think we should eat Packers' cupcakes. We can't give him the satisfaction.
I love my Mom. Okay. That's probably really the most obvious statement ever.
Oh no, I just, I decided to stay.
So I closed the door but the image of his...
Hey, put me down. Put me down. [Meredith turns and looks at Jim and Pam] Oh my god, hey, put me down. Hey...
I like fire drills. You know what's the greatest? Like, when you were in school and the teacher would let you have class outside.
Do you want us to count to three?
I didn���t watch the whole documentary. After a few episodes, it was too painful. I kept wanting to scream at Pam. It took me so long to do so many important things. It���s just hard to accept that I spent so many years being less happy than I could have been. Jim was 5 feet from my desk and it took me four years to get to him. It���d be great if people saw this documentary and learned from my mistakes. Not that I���m a tragic person. I���m really happy now. But���it would just���just make my heart soar if someone out there saw this and she said to herself ���be strong, trust yourself, love yourself. Conquer your fears. Just go after what you want and act fast, because life just isn���t that long.���
There's nothing better than a beautiful day at the beach, filled with sun, surf, and uh... diligent note-taking. [holds up notes]
Okay. I lost my engagement ring in ceramics class. Left it in my smock. I had this whole thing where I go back to class, wrongly accuse another girl. Look I even used makeup to put a ring around my finger, you can hardly see it, it's very subtle.
[serves] Hyuh! [other team misses and Scranton cheers] Well, look at that, we win!
I don't really have any control over that Stanley.
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. [excited] This is Pam. I did?
[trying to sleep as the baby cries]  Jim, Jim, get her.
Why do we have to see what Dwight says?
I don't often miss Roy. But I can tell you one thing. I wish someone had flashed me when I was with Roy. Because that would have been the ass-kicking of the year. [small laugh] Especially if it had been Jim. He would not have wanted me to have seen Jim's... Whoo, I am... I am saying a lot of things.
Do you want me to help you with that?
I don't think so, but they put paint where I didn't want paint. So...
Hold on, hold on.  It isn't midnight yet.
No, they have been dating for like two years. [Jim in shock] Since before your barbeque.
Oh, Michael. You can't be nasty today. [whispering] 'Cause of the... [points to 'Welcome Daughters!' sign]
[Jim comes out of the office]  What's the news?
What are the odds that this is in any way real?
I don't know what to tell you, Jim, but I saw a ghost.
I'm sorry. It's just, uhm, I actually do have this weird feeling that there���s something Jim isn't telling me.
Just because someone likes things clean, doesn't mean they're rich.
Uh, they're good. Uh, Jim's good. We're engaged.
Michael tends to procrastinate a bit whenever he has to do work. Umm, time cards, he has to sign these every Friday. Purchase orders have to be approved at the end of every month. And expense reports, all he has to do is initial these at the end of every quarter. But once a year, it all falls on the same Friday and that's today. I call it the Perfect Storm.
Oh, Dwight. I'm so sorry. Were you guys close?
It's a blessing in disguise. Actually, not even in disguise. Sometimes at home, I answer the phone, 'Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam.' So, maybe that'll stop now.
Phyllis, if you could switch to a different soap, just for a month or two? Yours is kind of perfumy.
[in the car] We still surprise each other.
So we shouldn't help you, no matter how much you might beg and plead?
I���m sure Athlead will be a huge success. But I don���t want him to do it anymore, and I don���t want to give him an ultimatum, but I am not moving our family to Philly.
Oh, um, it's just, I didn't, I didn't have a lot of time, so that's just a place holder.
I bet Michael had some elaborate theme party planned, like Scrambled Egg Saturday. [a few chuckles]
Good. Doesn't sound pushy...you're just stating a fact.
I think it's gonna put a damper on the party a little.
I feel horrible for blowing Jim's prank. I don't know if you can tell, but he's mildly upset. And Dwight hasn't been messed with in a while, so he's become a monster. I need to make this right.
What's it like without my glasses?  Um, well, here, I'll show you.  Unfocus your lens.  A lot.  I'm 20/400.  You got it?  Okay, I'm gonna spend the rest of the day like this.  I can't see any of the things that would bother me on a normal day.  I can't see anything disgusting, or ugly, or Michael... it's great.
[to Michael] What's the matter, you can't fight your own battles?
I don't want to have my baby here.
Yeah, but aren't you supposed to do that to our... no. It's great.
[People playing casino games as the actual Casino Night begins] Oh, my God!
Yeah, I distribute so I get all the memos.
Michael has employed Dwight to track you down.
Mm. Excuse me. Could I get some more water?
It is extremely stressful, planning a wedding by yourself. It's like a job. I mean, it's fun, but it kind of becomes like work. I've already planned it all out in my head. But it's just in my head.
Ohh, hey Gabe, I'm sorry, we... we didn't get you a cake or anything. We're gonna miss you.
Last week, Michael sent out this mysterious memo.
Sorry. What do I want? What do I want... Oh, it's a pencil cup.
[throws resolution board away in dumpster] Lesson learned.
[reading from Michael's flier] 'Drugs: Let's not and say we did.' I think Michael was high when he wrote this.
[referencing the ���tiny wheel���] Toilets! [everyone cheers as Meredith accepts her chore]
Michael? This is the press release I was telling you about.  Ryan wants you to share it with everyone.
Hey, Isabel, you made it. Oh, my goodness.
Well, you know... they don't call me the Bart Simpson of Scranton for nothing.
Oh! I... uh... yeah. Um... I'll uh show them to you later.
Oh, my God. When Dwight said no one wants to come in on a Saturday...
Different colored paint. I wanted different colored paint in the spots where they put their paint. So, it just is... OK, the point is, these warehouse guys are vandals. And, they need to be stopped.
O. [hits the ping-pong ball, and it hits the net] [serves] P.
[stopping her] Okay, don't turn this into some feminist issue.
I think... I mean, I don't know what it is but...
Why would anyone go to jail for that?
No no no, I want to see more of Philly Jim. I want Philly Jim.
Okay, which one of these looks more right? [holds up drawing of Stanley with and without a moustache]
Which just means we get to see more of our lovely street. Tell them what we saw today Jim.
Sure did. I was as surprised as you, but apparently, he is very passionate about public art.
You know, maybe we should just have our own pregnancies and not pretend like we���re in this together.
Great. Everything's great. Hey are you nervous about your big meeting?
You're so much happier now. Just go in there and be strong.
I'm gonna to miss Toby. He has a nice, calming presence in the office.
You might want to trim it a little.
[on phone]: Did you send Dwight on a quest for the Holy Grail?
I spent 10 years as a receptionist, to Michael Scott. And I have kids now. And I just, I can't.
I'm confused. Am I walking down the aisle to 'You Can Call Me Al?'
There are a few people I decided not to invite, and that might make things kind of awkward but ...  it's my wedding. And I don't want anyone there who has called me a hussy.
It says here you cater to the eldery.
He looks a lot like you. How much time did you spend on that?
Yeah, do you need a hand? [everyone joins in]
He took this job in Philly without telling me. He bought our house without telling me. At a certain point, he��shouldn't��be rewarded for that.
[on phone] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Just a second. Michael, it's Jan on the phone for you.
And I have my original. [holds up original paper, ripped in half]
Please hug and kiss me, no matter how hard I struggle.  I'm too shy to tell you that I love you.'
Why don't you wanna eat lunch with your boyfriend?
You're gonna give yourself a bonus of $645 instead of getting the entire office something it really needs?
[opens teapot] Oh my god! The yearbook picture!
If I could get her sleeping normally I could get my life back.
Yes. But there's, wait, oh, there's a funny ending to that story. I can't remember.
Well the first one has a surprise factor. 'I'm a suck suck-suckidy Sabre!'
Kelly! Um, how are you adjusting to the move?
Yeah, okay, I���m sorry. I���m sure we can get a copy. A lot of people were taping it.
You remember you fired Roy for attacking Jim and I don't talk to him anymore really.
Thank you. I appreciate that you appreciate that.
Oh, and if he makes a joke, just laugh it up, no matter what. Okay?
And that's what you said about Art School, and that's what you said about sales.
You don't look reluctant, Michael. You look really eager.
These are my painting clothes.I think I���m gonna do it. I am really gonna start painting the warehouse mural today. [Jim applauds]
Well, I appreciate that some opportunities can be unpleasant- [Jim's phone rings, he answers]
I love it, conservation.  Let's start by conserving our time and stop having these stupid meetings.   [stands up and cheers]  No more meetings!  No more meetings! No more meetings!  No more meetings!  [Stanley cheers her on in the background]
[raises hand] What is the cash value of a Schrute Buck?
Did a good job, Buddy. Now it���s time to come home.
I want to hit you.  I'll do that.
I did. And it's just one of those things that's going to keep gnawing at me, like 'gnaw, gnaw, why? Why didn't he? I have no idea why.'
[gasps] Yes! Cece wanted to thank everybody for letting her daddy stay home with her all last week and play, so she brought you a little treat.
When did you find time to do all this?
I am not going to let Kelly throw her life away on Ryan. And it has nothing to do with access to my pediatrician. Why you would even ask or were going to ask, because I- I felt like that question was coming.
Wow, Botticelli's, that sounds like a special occasion.
You've already disappointed him so much.  He can't be expecting a lot from you.
We wanted to stay on the phone all day, but the company has a policy against eight-hour personal calls. So we're not telling anyone.
Hey.  I'm not going to get in the car, because I know if I do you'll try to drive me to the hospital.
Bottle of rum it is. [takes package out of bag] Alright, shall we?
It's nice having Katy around. It's another person for Michael to um, interact with.
No, I want you to say that you think the 'best' person to be our new manager is a homeless person.
A world where you truly can be anything you want.
No.  I don't think I can hit you in the office.
And then, out of that cake, pops another stripper holding a smaller cake. And then an even smaller stripper pops out of that one.
Sure, uh, Jan... um, do you know, is anyone coming back to Scranton?
OK. [Goes out onto terrace] Oh wow, you have a nice view.
One of the simplest ways to cut down on the spread of germs is to use something called the vampire cough.
Michael, this is a terrible terrible thing you've done.
You need to get something for your girlfriend.
Yeah, I think we should get him to the hospital.
I kind of thought something would happen tonight too.
Three hours from now or three hours from earlier like 4:00?
Okay, be careful, Kevin. They're kind of spicy.
Just because two people are hanging out, it doesn't mean that they're together,  you know?  Like people can just be friends.  And I think that it was really unfair to think that there was anything else going on.
Just to reiterate, none of us is going to say anything that might indicate that we are going broke.
Oh, thank God.  I haven't had caffeine in nine months.
Can we take a look at the suite now?
Oh, don't worry about it. I mean, it's better than listening to Michael play a conch shell... which is what I was doing. Oh, also, Michael went to Jamaica with Jan!
Yeah, maybe I'll just move in with my boyfriend 'cause he's kind of a slob, too.
Oh, okay. Okay, I will. [hangs up phone]
No, I mean he's sulking. That's not like him.
[on voicemail, because she's calling Jim at the same time] Hi, this is Pam.  Leave a message.
He didn't leave me. He just went part time. [Meredith scratches her head vigorously] Can you just fill out the form please?
It was supposed to be for Meredith, 'cause she said she likes my drawings.
Well, I wish that made me feel better. Listen, so everybody saw the promos and they're kinda freaking out. [Brian laughs] Cause it seems like you got a lot of private stuff on camera-
I was going to say good because I'll have all the help I need?
Well... I always dreamed of a house with a terrace upstairs. Plant flowers on it... stuff like that. Since I was a girl. Um... More seriously though, a husband that I love... Roy. And I love to draw. And I... I did a little in college and I'd still love to do something where I could work with art or graphic design in some way.
And that was fun. But what about a year from now?
The weirdest part is Andy. The aftermath got dumped on him and the way he's been handling it is just..so..
[Dwight slams something on desk] What was that?
Roy, I picked those flowers. Phyllis just stole all of my ideas for our wedding.
So um, I've been thinking about this whole chair/copier thing...
[over loudspeaker, imitating Darth Vader] Luke, this is your father. Come set the table for dinner.
Hey, where have you been all night? I was looking forward to hanging out with you.
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. ... Uh, sure, I'll get him for you. [to Michael] It's Jan for you.
You talked to the man whose wife you're having an affair with.
I���m afraid that you���re gonna resent me and I���m afraid that���
[talking head with Jim] It's clear why we were trying not to tell people. That's clear now. [Jim nods, looking at floor]
And Sunday I'm thinking of going to that flea-market at the drive-in.
And Jim can jump back in without skipping a beat. We���ll come back to visit. But I think it���s time for us to officially���
Well, you shouldn���t be nervous about this. This is a tiny start-up with a bunch of guys just as dorky as Jim.
Oh, can we stop by that pie stand on the way?
Yeah. I mean, listen if we���re gonna do this thing, we should do it right.
Yes.  And I think they gave him too many fries.
OK, we're leaving for the hospital at 1.
No, we settled in a much more rational place, remember?
[Singing, Pam mumbling lyrics] Closing time, time for you to go home to the places you will be from.
Right.  And, you wouldn't be able to talk to Karen.
[in unison] I do not think that is funny.
At least she lived a very long and I'm sure, a very happy life. Got you this card. When you're ready. We all signed it. We just wanted you to know we're thinking about you.
I know, right? What is it? You always look so good in those things.
But then you fall asleep and there's nothing for me to do.
Yes.  She was a little fussy earlier, but she's totally quieted down.  Here, let me just, uh, let me just burp her.  I don't want her to spit up on you.  Come here, sweety...  Oh, my God!  Wrong baby!
Okay, just so you know, it's just the students from my class in a little studio.
I know how to operate my phone, okay? Listen, we���re getting close. We will talk to you later. Say, ���Bye, Daddy.���
Oh, boy. Maybe your heels are too high.
Roy's right. There's no guarantee it's going to lead to anything anyway.
I feel like I've been kinda cold to Karen and there's no real reason for it. I mean it's not like she's ever done anything to me. So, I think I probably shouldn't be cold to her.
[answering the phone] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. I'm sorry, he's not in yet. Would you like his voicemail?
When it comes down to it, it's a health issue.  I should have written that.
Well, I will be spending the entire afternoon in grief counseling for someone I've never met.
He finally has a story everyone wants to hear... and he knows it.
Yeah, but I mean, if you really like this person, then you should see where it goes.
I know. Yeah, and it was going really great at first. I got video.
Well, ya know, Michael is a great delegator. He never does any work himself. Ever. And one time, I walked in on him naked, and his thing is so small. [quickly walks off stage] If it were an iPod it would be a shuffle! [clapping, laughter]
Oh, no we're actually married. We're not brother and sister.
That's weird, my breast pump is missing. Have you seen my breast pump?
It's just so dumb. [chokes up] But when he describes himself as a child, lost on the life raft...
Okay, they're almost here- What? Come on. If you guys are gonna be mean, could you at least be subtle? [rips down ugly photo of Nellie]
Oscar, Kevin, this is my sister, Penny. She's also my maid of honor.
Katy and Jim met in the office. And now I guess they're like going out, or dating, or something. And, uh... I don't know! You know? They're just... She calls him, and they... You know, I'm sorry. I feel like I'm talking really loud. Am I talking really loud?
Yes, and then we decided that was crazy.
[pointing to Jim's bluetooth headset] What's that? Is that a-
[studying mural wall] I guess if I make a mistake, I can just paint over it with a shrub or something. It���s just, I think less of paintings with a lot of shrubs. So, I���m gonna limit myself to one shrub.
[to Michael on speakerphone] Ok, you want me to read 'em?
I can't do this. I don't have this sales gene, or whatever it is. Tell me everything is going to be ok.
No... [Jim leans in for another kiss] Jim---
[hangs up phone] Dwight. Dwight. Can you please tell new building owner that he is screwing over all the people he works with, people he's worked with for years. His friends.
Yeah, yeah, no, no. It���s a good idea to brush your teeth. But you have to um, feed your children. Send them to school. You know, all things you can���t do if you just keep singing ���Monster Mash.���
[yawns] Yeah, or no... well... I don't know. I'm sorry. I was up all night with Cece, otherwise I'd be running this.
Yeah, I'm gonna do some mock ups, and then turn those into thumbnails, maybe do some... splash frames. [laughs] I don't know what I'm talking about but I'm excited.
Dwight!  Go to my house.  Get my iPod.  I think it's on the kitchen table.  Do not touch anything else.  The key is under...
Hey honey, I don't think we should push him.
It didn't have anything to do with race.
Hello, Mr. Schrute, nice to see you. Please have a seat.
Actually, it's kind of too bad we're not coming into work tomorrow.
Kevin, you and Stacy set a date yet?
Ceramics class. Then dinner by myself. I'm gonna watch HGTV and maybe go to Bungalow 8 with John Mayer.
...and he said, That's what everyone sees, that's the Man In Black.
So, um... we'll do it after work.  In the parking lot.  In front of everyone.  I'm going to hit you as hard as I can.
We were supposed to go to the barbeque at Jim's house.
Well, you should cover it with the broccoli.
[on other end in conference room] Please hold for Ms. Black.
Uh, that is Creed Bratton. He has four toes and he fought in the Civil war.
You have any big Valentine's Day plans, Kev?
Nope.  No, no, that's better.  That wasn't even the worst of them.  I'm fine.
I mean, who knows? Maybe I have a niece my family never told me about.
Michael, you shouldn't do anything that you're uncomfortable with.
Will you just, will you grab Clark real quick?
Maybe you could play a song on your recorder.
Hey!  This is not half-way!  I did the math.  I had to drive way longer than you.  Montclair would have been closer, so you have to buy lunch.
Nellie's pretty fearless. And I think she might be maybe even almost sort of fun.
Yeah. Hey Michael, look at this lamp. $8.00.
Cool! Here's a little 'way to go' gift from Sabre. [tosses Erin a Frisbee]
OK, I can tell you're mad at me. Do you wanna just, um, I don't know, tell me why?
Jim, I don't want the first thing the baby hears to be the 8 Mile soundtrack.
Hey, well, good morning.  I think I have good news for you today.  I found your new executive assistant.  My friend Carla.  [looking at resume]  She's got great experience.  We even considered making her Cece's godmother, but she had this boyfriend at the time-- but here's her resume.
We came to an agreement. We're going to live in a stunning pre-war brownstone at the top of a mountain.
Okay, I know I���ve been crying easily today, but- [shows unfolded paper Jim dropped, shows two lists, ���Pam��� and ���Cece��� on one side, ���Everything else��� on the other] I mean, that���s just pretty killer, right? I mean, maybe it���s stupid. No. [starts crying] It���s wonderful. I���m gonna frame it. I can always unframe it.
Hey, I was talking to Cathy. Turns out she is single.
Roy's my fiance. We've been engaged about three years. We were supposed to get married in September but I think we're gonna get married in the spring.
Oh, no, it's just that if a vampire had to cough, he would do it like this. [coughs into elbow]
But that's okay. Because it's not about being perfect, it's about trying.  In fact, why don't we go around and confess some of the ways that we've fudged on some of our resolutions?
We have to come from a position of strength.
[while leafing through Michael's appointment book and seeing nothing but free time] Um, oh boy, let's see, he's really...
Seriously? Because it sounds like one of those is better than the other.
No, but that would've been a really good idea.
I called the doctor like a week ago.  I couldn't wait...  Oh, God, don't be mad.
[voicemail message for Jim] Hey, Jim.  It's Pam.  I keep looking up to say something to you and then Michael's there and it's horrible.  Anyway, I'm bored.  Come back!
I think that I should help him get home.
So my corner's the one with the copier?
Roy's sister looked into it, and the application alone costs a thousand dollars.
That's weird. I mean, that's weird to have sex in the office. That's where you work, right?
I thought I was very specific about you not letting up a magician.
So, not the ring then? The- the- Not doing the ring?
You put in the garbage can that was a special filing cabinet.
Wait a second, I thought you said that you were hurt.
[loudspeaker] Jim Halpert? Price check on fabric softener, the kind that gives you...
Okay. I'll go look for another one. [she leaves]
Look, seriously, I can move it fine. Come on, let's go, it's our ball. Let's go!
Be careful. I pulled my mom's dog off a pillow once, and I got bit.
You know what? I'm sick of this! Let's go, you and me!
There���s this balloon that has been floating in the rafters of the warehouse for, like, ever. And, okay, it���s not -- it doesn���t sound cool. You just have to see it.
Well, I don't wanna speak for Jim, but, it's like pretty official. [Jim smiles]
I think it's interesting how Forster uses Italy to represent sexuality and passion. [Kevin dumping change in the snack machine] And that also brought up themes of, uh, you know, fate and coincidence.  And Lucy's torn between these two things.  She's torn between passion and convention.
Oh, okay.  Well, Michael wants to see everyone in the conference room. [Jim shakes his head. Seems relieved to be getting away from Kelly] But you know what? We have a few minutes so you guys should definitely finish up your conversation. [Jim nods his head as if to say, 'Gee, thanks, Pam.']
I don't think Jim means to say that you shouldn't touch her.
Yeah, if I could have seen what he just did, I think I would have gotten angry.
I think we broke his brain. [they both snicker]
Michael, do you need me to call an ambulance?!
I have the lowest sales record of anyone here.
Bill Bourbon was my uncle.  I would have never hurt him any more than I'd hurt a June bug.
In his office. You can go right in.
No, I'm sure they're pretty much the same as the English instructions.
I just keep getting bored. And I let things build up and build up and then I - I, I do something too big, like this. Who does this?
There are a few ways to get promoted. One is to wait for an opening and apply for it. That's the main way. But this could work.
No, because... [Dwight and Michael walk in and march into Michael's office, silencing the conversation]
Well, I can't really imagine you yelling at anyone.
Well I think they'll get the spirit of it.
Really. And I don't know about you, but I don't know of a lot of happy marriages that start off with an ultimatum, do you?
Hey. [walks up to Oscar and hands him a report to sign]
Here it is. [Andy is still singing] Suite 401.
Dwight, what are you doing!? We've only been in here for, like, two seconds!
[knocking on Angela's car window, Angela is naked inside] Hey in there. It's Pam. It's not Dwight! Don't think it's Dwight!
Post-it Notes? What are those worth, 50 cents?
Great. Uh, except, I don't want to be a receptionist anymore.
Next time we're all in this room Jim and I will be married.
No. Except for the pendant that you bought me. Which I love.
Oh, great. Oh, I���m sorry. Do you mind telling me her name? I realized we don���t have it.
Andy, I am getting married in 8 hours.
Yeah, just a little, I have a lot to deal with today.
Hey honey, it's me. Just trying to catch you before going home. Um, oh, well just give me a call whenever. Hope your day got better. Love you.
I thought it might be fun to set her up with someone. Any ideas?
Hi. Wow, I really thought I'd be more excited to be here.
Well, I guess it doesn���t look that cool either. But, it���s been up there a long time, so it���s become a pretty big deal.
So, I guess that's how they're gonna play this. It is on. [very serious] It is so on.
Yes, but Reception is a one person department. If I get you a new computer I have to get one for everyone in sales. For Dwight, for Stanley, it would be crazy.
Hey, Deangelo, my mom just sent me this picture of Cece, it is so adorable.
You know, I really do think it would be worth it to pull over and just take ten minutes to eat.
[Pam and Jim are sitting in Jim's car in front of Detroit Coney Island Chili Dogs] This is the best burger I've ever had, babe.
No, I liked him. For a couple of days. Four years ago. [Jim nodding repeatedly] You know I have a kid with you, right?
Yeah. Oh, you should come to my art show, by the way.
I still need... you know, my breakthrough, or whatever. [Woman leaves, Roy enters] Hey, babe, how are you?
He's not coming out. He won't pick up the phone.
And you kind of torpedo every romantic relationship you're in.
[reading from paper] Can you make that straighter? That job looks hard. You should put your mouth on that. How can you even use that one naturally?
Man, Angela really had a hold on him. [Dwight playing the recorder in the background]  Angela.
You just have to go in there. You have to hear it from her.
My theory is that... [Jim signals he's leaving, waves bye to Pam]
You know, maybe there's an opportunity for a joke there, like, um... like, [vaudeville delivery] 'I just delivered a baby. They didn't offer me a guarantee.'
Okay, okay, we're not going to the hospital.  We are waiting until midnight.
Just terrible.  And the longer you put it off, the worse it's going to get.
[telephone ringing] Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. Um, hold, please. [to Jim] There's a Brenda on the phone for you. [to Brenda] Just one second, I'll transfer.
Say they don���t hire you. It���s not like you���re out on the street. You have a great job with people who love you.
Every so often, Jim dies of boredom. I think today it was the expense reports that did him in. And our deal is that, it's up to me to revive him.
Well, since we're stopped at a light, uhhh, here is...the mural I did for Angela's baby.
Oh, I made us a date to take my mom out to dinner to thank her for all that extra babysitting.
Mm. [walks into bathroom, Meredith is using her brest pump] Meredith!
Yeah, but there's other, better people out there who are helping.
[Pam, Ryan and Michael enter office] Sounds neat.
Ok, for the record, I am pregnant and, obviously there has been some kind of a mistake, so why doesn't Jim just pick the next highest score on the list and we'll move on.
Okay, this is just a Christmas card from your paper supplier. No one's putting this on their fridge.
[taking Michael's picture] Okay, a little bit more closer to the sign. Yeah.
So this was all just a trick. You don���t really have any business to give?
[wearing glasses] Um... yeah, I slept over at a, uh, friend's house and, I forgot my contact solution, so... I had to wear my backup glasses... Shut up.
He left it at reception and we photocopied it.
What does that even mean? Where would your name appear?
Don't you think it's better to tell him the truth now? You know, rather than waste more of his time?
[sees Erin holding Cece] Oh, my God! Go, go!
You know what? I-- I-- I don���t think you want to start a conversation with me about what���s fair. Okay? This is way more intense than I ever --
[laughing] I'm just saying, Roy is very competitive.
Oh... come on, bear man. Come on. [the lights flicker]
Michael, do not let your imagination run out of control.
Come on, let's go. I wanna call your doctor.
[on her cell phone] Hey where are you? Yeah, we were supposed to meet here. What? Oh my gosh! That ties in perfectly with something that Michael was telling me earlier! I just don't know what some of the people in, like, accounting are going to do? It said specifically that...
My veil tore.  I knew when we were getting married and I'm five months pregnant that I'm not going to be able to wear the dress that I always wanted or high heels--
I'm sorry. Did that? That was out of the blue-
Yeah? [stops laughing] It was though, that's what happened.
Oh, wow, it's almost time for ultra feast!  Where's Kevin?
No, no. It's the principle of the thing.
Hey, uh, any volunteers to come with me to go buy a Christmas tree?
Michael, do you remember, you specifically told me to only bring one sheet of paper? You said it only takes one sheet to make a difference. And I said, 'Are you sure Michael?' And you said 'Pam! Pam! Pam!' And then you sneezed in my tea, and then you said, 'Don't worry, it's just allergies.' Do you remember that?
Oh I don't care, I didn't really like that place that much anyway. I'll just move.
No, no, no, no talking. Jim is not allowed to talk until after he buys me a coke.  Those are the rules of jinx, and they are unflinchingly rigid.  [Jim puts money in drink machine, selection is sold out]
I don't know!  Let's go by the house and get it.  It's only twenty minutes past the hospital!
Seems like a basic reward system where you give us points, and then we redeem those points for prizes.
Um, I don't think so, I just bought it.
Yes... nice!  I can't remember the last time someone made me dinner.
I forgot I have to support him no matter what. Close one.
Okay. Um... here it is. Don't put your fingers in there. [shreds paper] Cool huh?
[to Jim] Shush. [to Kevin] Kevin, a playful touch on the arm, or on the back, it can show your interest and it's really romantic.
Oh, wow. Seriously? Oh my gosh, is that champagne?
Okay, alright, thanks...  Okay, do you want to eat?  You want to try eating?  Okay...  Okay, let me...  Just you and me.  Come on.  There we go...  Yeah...  Oh, yeah.  Like that.  There we go.  You got it.
[whispering] Hey, Jim, can I talk to you for a second?
For what it's worth, I liked your party better.
Can you believe my boss proposed to his girlfriend in public? That is so Michael.
I���m back. Oh, hey, look, and now it���s like a double date.
Plants and- hi, Robert! Hey, um, how are you doing? Good to see you again.
You know, I never did it, but for your 30th birthday I really wanted to surprise you with-
Yeah, um, there's good things about Michael. He uh, uh... Yeah, definitely. Um...
Hide, they���re giving out jobs upstairs. Why don���t you go up and get one?
Mose, Angela hasn't been around here much lately, has she?
Everything is fine.  You don't have to worry.  Try not to think about it.  She's not coming out for a while, okay?
Really? Okay, well, um, I like consistency in the manager's position, no weird silent coups. Stuff like that. I'm easy.
I think we should get a townhouse in SoHo...
I mean, I don't know. So... what's it like dating a cheerleader?
Uh, could we come in too? Just for some water.
Michael and Jan together in Jamaica. I guess I would just need a little bit more evidence than seeing it with my own eyes.
Oh, great. I forgot mine and I'm wearing a two piece.
Oh yeah, sure. Um, I hope I can help.
It's only for three weeks, you know with my mom and sister at the house it'll be..
Why would you want to raise your cholesterol?
Michael sends me a postcard from every vacation he goes on. Atlantic City, he wishes I was here. Busch Gardens, Virginia, all I got was this lousy postcard. And this time, I'm Jamaican-him-crazy. I don't know how far away he thought he was, because he put $10 worth of stamps on this.
I can tell Michael's mood by which comedy routine he chooses to do, the more infantile, the more upset he is. And he just skipped the Ace Ventura talking butt thing. He never skips it. This is bad.
Cece, is reverse cycling, which means she sleeps all day and is up all night. Which basically means I'm up all day and I'm up all night. And if it doesn't stop soon, I am going to be up all night.
Hey, Oscar, come here. Oscar, this is Matt, and um, Matt loves your pate.
Brake lights. Break lights! Break lights! Break lights!!!
I���ve been through several rounds of development with the team and here���s where we stand with the chore wheel. [introducing a third ���chore wheel���, excited] We���ve got prizes! Ten bucks, candy bar, manager for an hour but, there are also penalties. Like, no internet, Stanley gets your lunch. The one thing that is not on the chore wheel is chores. But they were right; it���s more fun this way.
I can't believe he's getting a CAT scan.
Jim, what if we both lose our jobs?  I'm trying to think of a way that this all ends up fine, and I can't think of one.
Somebody defaced the billboards we just put out in an inappropriate way.
Let's see.  I had an aunt that I was really close to.  She was this amazing female boxer.  Um, anyway, she was injured in a fight, and she was paralyzed.  So, you can imagine how upset I was when I found out that she asked her manager to remove her breathing tube so she could die.
All right. I did not come back here just to see you.
For us, um, nothing new, really the kids are great.
I know.  And how long is CJ gonna spin this whole MS thing?  How can Josh and Sam keep quiet?
Yeah, but I mean, look at the salary. And it's definitely a step up. And a challenge.
[in New York] That's what she said! That's what she said! That's what she said!
Really? I've been putting the kids to bed by myself every night for a months. And you had to miss one phone call. Is that your truth, Jim? That's really your truth?
[Clears her throat] The party planning committee, minus Angela, has decided that we're all going to do Dwight's Christmas.
At this point, when you're this pregnant, it's kind of like senior spring. The other day I spit my gum out on the carpet.
New York is so exciting. I love my classes. The city's awesome. Um, can you give me back to Jim now, please?
If Dwight's about to get fired, you have to tell him. Just get the words out. That's all you can do.
Yeah, you don't grab these [gestures to her chest] for balance.
Okay. Okay, here. Okay, so the next time he goes to the bathroom, I���ll distract him, you take that.
Okay, so here's what I'm thinking. I'm gonna say that before ceramics class, I took off my ring, and then when I changed back out of my smock, it wasn't in my pocket anymore, and I lost it.
So you guys, you know what's an even more useful treat...is cash. So-
Okay. Well, if you think of it, I'll be here.
Michael, Ryan wants to introduce the branch managers in a few minutes.  You just have to wave and introduce yourself.
I've been working forever on Jim's present. He always gives me the best Christmas gifts. He'll take a memory or a private joke, and he'll create something totally unique. I love them. So this year I made him something. A comic book. It stars Jimmy Halpert, a mild-mannered paper Salesman who, while riding his bike through the forest, is bitten by a radioactive bear, becomes 'bear man'. Wreaks havoc on the office. It's really good.
Sometimes I don't put Michael through until he's already said something. I look at it as a practice run for him. He usually does better on the second attempt.
I don't know, I just, I really thought Jim was gonna propose tonight...
My dad spent the night at our place last night.  My parents have been fighting for weeks and... it kinda sucks.  Jim's been great. But I'm gonna need to buy my dad a robe.
Oh, damn. [Pam looks down at her salad] They've been in there for like ten minutes.
No, I wouldn���t. I can���t even relate to that impulse. But I bet I could get us a customer complaint. I���d like to try.
Come down and... open it and you'll see.
People treat us like the race on our forehead. And then we guess what race we are.
It was a ghost, I told you this on, like, our first date.
Stealing? What am I supposed to have stolen?
I asked Tom and Pete to come early so we could play a prank on Jim at lunch! Pretty awesome, right? I think they're into the idea. They're probably thinking, 'That Pam Beasly, she's the coolest sister-in-law on the planet. She's the best! The absolute best.'
OK. I'm gonna be a few minutes. So it's only twenty past five. I still have to do my faxes.
No, uh, me Stanley and Phyllis so far.
Hm. I'm looking forward to getting to know you better, Vikram.
OK Michael, you know what? I might have someone for you.
Do we know anyone who was in the accident?
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Sure, can I ask who's calling? Just a second.
Yesterday, they delivered the new one. But they didn't set it up. So my day just got a little more interesting. [holds up a huge manual]
No, no, no, it's fine. I was just commenting. We gotta get these out, open 'em up.
I'm saving that 'cause I like it when the cards go T-ts-ts-tch-tch-tch.
You can buy new stuff but you can't buy a new party.
Got it. I will put out a A.P.B. Otherwise known as a 'Ask Pam Beasley'. ... Did the phone cut off?
There are a lot of one person departments here, so, there's a lot of department heads. But I'm off to a good start. Oh, man! If I could pull this off, it will be scam of all scams. And yet very helpful to everyone.
[to Nellie] Maybe, maybe I could, could get the ball rolling. [Nellie nods] Um, Frank? Hi. Pam. Um, I am so sorry if I've done anything to offend you. I'm sure it isn't easy for you guys to have an upstairs person coming down in your space. So. Truly. If, if, I apologize. But enough about me. Your turn.
[feels a pain in her breast] Ooh. Ah-ah-ah. Ha-ha.
Ok. I, just, when you are done or any time it's convent, I just thought since you are out...
Well, I am a few months ahead of you.
Race had nothing to do with it. I just knew they'd be good together.
I love you, but I'm kinda busy. So I need you to figure this one out on your own.
Not anymore.  It's, um... It's completely over now.
I'm sorry to interrupt you. Um, I actually have something very important to talk to you about, business related.
We don't normally download films illegally.  Because we're honest,  hardworking people.
I also would like to toast Phillip Halpert, who is due even sooner. May he be a good namesake to my grandfather who I promised as a child long before tonight that I would one day name my son after him. To Phillip Halpert!
He's uncomfortable because you're acting weird. So you have to stop acting weird.
Not that I call myself an impressionist, per se.
[whispering] Um, I���m sorry. I have to go. My daughter���s a ladybug. I know that doesn���t make any sense. Um, thank you, thank you.
I have the most boring job in the office, so... why wouldn't I have the most boring job on beach day?
Creed. I noticed you don't have a resolution on the board. What's yours?
Oh my God. Is that Jan? [points to same monitor]
Maybe it'll be good because then she can like socialize with the other babies.
Hey Angela, you wanna see a picture of Phillip wearing those little booties you got us?
Okay fine! There must be some way to get out of it. Even just for tonight!
But I'm not kidding.  I really want to do it.
We need to come up with one realistic thing that we could do today.
[long pause] And of course, if there's ever anything I can ever do for you...
It would've been just as easy for him to spell insect. Of course, that wouldn't have made any sense either.
Fair enough. Um... I don't think you're a very good person. And forgive me, but I feel like I've said this to you before: I don't like you very much.
Parenting? Yeah. This is Cici���s favorite magazine. She loves the pictures of babies.
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh hi ,David. [Michael shakes his head to Pam] No, I'm sorry he's not back from the Civil Rights rally. I'll have him call you the minute he gets back from the Lincoln Memorial.
[with five popcorn bags left] Anyone else?  Nooo.
What no, wait! You said you were gonna help us!
I know, because you're the reason we're moving.
Roy and I just got back from the Poconos.  I get ten vacation days a year, and I try to hold off taking them for as long as possible, and this year I got to the third week in January.
Prison Mike? What was the food like in prison?
Wait, when am I...? You just have to be clear and firm. You know, just tell him you don't love him. Just be honest with him. [Erin nods]
Is this because Jim walked in on you going to the bathroom?
People are really into the costume contest this year. Might have something to do with the prize, maybe you've heard of it. The 2011 Scranton Wilkes-Barre coupon book worth over fifteen thousand dollars in savings!
I spent a month putting that rolodex on his Blackberry, which he now uses as a nightlight.
Okay. [walks to conference room with Andy and stares at the sign up sheet with wonder] When did people sign-
I was, and then they switched to Acrobat just as I was learning Quark.  I hate computers.
I have the worst attitude of any person here.
Oh. Ok. I've heard you exclaim. Like the time you said, 'Hey, look. We parked over here!'.
I feel good. [sees a huge pile of French toast] Wow.
Come on Angela, don't you have a game?
No, I know that you���re, like, happy and, like, you had fun today.
Hey, sorry, I really didn't want to come in. It's just that we have to go buy a new Christmas tree, and we're hoping we could borrow your truck.
Okay.  So... you would be the Regional Manager,
Don't get on it. [Michael inches toward elevator]
It's 'whom' when it's the object of a sentence, and 'who' when it's the subject.
That's a sad story. I have another one. We move, the other tenants follow, the bank takes the building, takes your farm, takes your car and beats the crap out of you. Penniless, you die, and my daughter Cece dances on your grave... fully clothed. [lights turn off, Pam and Dwight begin to wave their arms to alert the sensor]
Nope.  I, like you, have never been here before.
We got the van at a used car lot.  We think it says 'Alleluia Church of Scranton.' in Korean.  It was either this or an old school bus with an owl living in it.
Well done. And we managed to kill the entire morning.
So, I just wanted to confirm that you're not coming to my wedding.
Well, it was, uh, it was really nice meeting you, Alan.
Angela, I want to talk to you about something.
I don't know, I kind of hate all our regular places right now. Oh, you know what [Jim gets down on one knee], that one...
That's fizzling. I mean, someone has to start the fizzle.
I'm just gonna sit here for a little bit longer if that's okay. The air smells so good. I don't remember it smelling so good. The chairs are so comfortable.
The news that you just announced?  That Ed died?
Please? Kelly's trash talking me because Darryl is beating you.
[recorded on phone] Excuse me, I have to get back to work.
Okay, Phyllis sits across from him every day. Phyllis, does he have a moustache or not?
You made him lose the account by screaming at him the entire time.  It's okay, Ryan.
Oh come on. You really think I'm gonna have a fourteen pound baby?
And, poof! He disappears. [Jim snaps, playing along]
Weird to see how we used to look in those promos. Some of us have changed so much.
On average, how many hours a day do you spend naked in your office? Just ballpark.
You are going to text me, the morning of my wedding.
Because I���m so glad you���re back, baby, but I���m just���I was talking to Darryl, and he was talking about the trip, and I just feel like you���re giving up so much.
Oh no, do you think it was stolen?
[after Angela gives her a stack of files]: I'm going into labor!
Oh my god! I love it! Uh, I���Nellie, this is brilliant!  [sees Jim] Hey!
What could he possibly stand to gain from a real juggling routine?  How can you keep defending him?
Today's a 'women in the workplace' thing. Jan's coming in from Corporate to talk to all the women about... um... I don't really know what. But Michael's not allowed in. She said that about five times.
Guess what poster he had on his wall?
Yeah, and when Michael gets a broken heart, this whole place comes to a halt, so we're just trying to get out in front of this.
Yeah. I'm in charge of this whole area.
Ok I think animals and proposals are out. Right Ryan didn't you read in one of your blogs that animals are out?
I'm saying we should go scorched earth on that guy's face.
I'm still not sure why this woman is even here.
Yes, I'll be sure someone returns your call.  I'm so sorry.  Bye.
Oh, can I help? We could say someone is related to, uhm, Tonya Harding.
[changing voice] Good afternoon Iris, it's a pleasure.
I'd also like to say a few words if that's okay.
[sighs] It���s fine. It���s just a seating arrangement. Doesn���t matter.
Is this what I've become? Materialistic? Shallow? I feel horrible. [looks down at the check] oh look! 'Mrs. Pam Halpert!' That's the first time I've seen it in writing!
Because you love her?  [baby voice]  Because you love her very much?
You know what, I think we should get some other input.
They said they were done with the investing and then you volunteered ten thousand dollars?
I'm done. What are you... Is that supposed to be my mural?
Michael, you have to put your hands down.
He said if it takes off he���s gonna buy us a new car.
[pours something from the fridge into a bowl and opens the microwave, it is covered in exploded food] Oh, come on! [to the documentary crew] Do you see this?  Disgusting.
Michael, you've had two ideas today. And one of them was great. And the other one was terrible.
I'm sorry. You guys have probably noticed my stomach's a little more sensitive lately. So, if you wouldn't mind wearing a little less perfume... and if your lunch is especially pungent, maybe have it in the break room?
Yeah. I love being on the road, but I especially love the time and a half pay 24 hours a day, for three days. Cause I have a mortgage now, got a bring home the bucks.
Oh, yeah! We have such a solid foundation, you know.
Maybe it was Meredith. Maybe she brought in lice that are totally different than the lice that i got from Cece. So let's not jump to the simplest conclusion that she got her lice from me. That is how wars get started. Fine, I'll tell her it was me.
Give it back for what? What're you gonna do with it?
Does that mean an idea that blows up in our faces later? [Pam's phone rings]
[gesturing to Michael dancing in his office] He looks happy.
Okay, well I didn't think about it like that. It's just, I can't do anything about it. I can't replace that one unless that computer breaks.
Oh, some guy exposed himself to Phyllis in the parking lot.
He just so happy to have a family plan.
It's the world's tiniest Bluetooth. I found it in a Japanese gadget store in the village. I got one for Jim, too. Jim, say something.
Oh great. Um, no, this weekend? Nothing. I'm not really doing anything.
[Hunter's voice starts singing, Pam joins in] One night...
What was that?! [everyone runs to Michael's office window]
Tomorrow I start a three-month design program at the Pratt Institute in New York. I will be a little fish in the big apple. [does hand gesture] What up, 212?
You know what, Michael? For what it's worth... I was wrong, too. I thought she was interested in you.
Dwight, there is one rule that you need to take very seriously.
Well, of course not, but does physical appearance include smell?
Oh, my God, [eating a bar in the hallway] I thought I was gonna pass out.  [Jim takes it from her and takes a bite]
Are you sure you don't want to play?
I just, uh, thought you'd want to know that.
Hey, Abby! Do you want to help me shred some old documents? It's actually pretty cool.
[at her desk, grabs her plant and sees it dried up, looks at Jim] Oh. You couldn't have watered it?
What's going on, why do you have a second job?
No, wait. Hey, while you are out, could pick up some paper towels and chocolate syrup? We have ice cream so I thought...
Angela - she used to stay here sometimes?
Yeah, he's so great. Remember how it felt when he cheated on you though?
Hey!  Jim! Um, listen, can I call you back in a little bit?  I made friends!
[points to Jim's iPod] You have new music?
Dwight, no gun, okay? Don't make us call Jo.
That was weird, huh? It's all part of the presentation. It was confusing, right? Because confusing situations happen to us all the time in our jobs. [pauses] I'm just trying to bridge the gap between what just happened and the fact that I'm going to be doing the rest of the presentation.  [reading from the cards, in Forrest Gump voice] Sales is like a box a chocolates, you never know which vendor you're gonna get. Forrest Gump.
Sure. Just one second. Please have a seat.
[on phone] Hey, uh, give me a call back when you get a chance. Cece did great, and I want to tell you something.
Okay. This one is the same price but it's got...
Wow. He is officially the worst human being.
Okay, I get it. [Michael laughs] Why are you giggling?  Is this a joke?  [Michael continues to laugh] Michael, is this-- did I get the job?
We have good give and take. [vaudeville delivery] I give, he takes.
What can I do for you, Michael? I'm kinda busy.
[loading up car with Michael] Don't look up. Don't look up. [sighs as office workers all looking from window]
Hey Jim. Stanley's back from the hospital today. Can you sign his card?
Nothing happened. We went on a couple of dates. He never called me again.
[points to smoke] Oh, my God! Uh, Oh my God!
So, maybe just try one at first, and then if it's okay, have a couple more...
Well, I mean, the only reason he doesn't is because I'm breastfeeding, and Phillip doesn't like a bottle.
Well, that���s funny because I think of him as working part time in Philadelphia.
[whispers to Jim] Hey.  Something just happened.  Dwight just told Angela that she has to deleted all of her sensitive e-mails immediately.
I have a ton of stuff to do for the wedding. And I have to do it in the office. And that can be kind of awkward. Um... just because people can get all weird about wedding stuff. Then... I just... I don't want to offend... Angela... or someone.
My personal favorite is the one he made for his condo association.
Well, other things you can do to help cut down on the spread of disease are to wash your hands regularly. Don't come in if you're sick.
So are you going to be like totally awkward around me now?
Not really. It's kinda weird that a grown man is singing from the point of view of a little girl.
[looking up from her pilfering of Bob's food] What?
Hi everyone.  My name is Pam, and I wear glasses.
I think I should hire them all. Do like Lollapalooza.
Are you going to cry, Jim? Do you need a tissue?
Oh, thanks. My Mom made it for me.
Um, I don't know, I'm just like, I'm going a little crazy 'cause I keep overhearing all these conversations between Michael and corporate about like, staff issues?
Roy and I are saving for the wedding, so I made him promise not to get me anything too big.
No, Sarah Kaya comes in.  Don't interrupt, I have like thirty seconds to finish this and get to DigiPres.
This was a terrible relationship. You were not happy when you were with her.
Oh, awesome.  You're a life saver.  [drinks from coffee cup] Wait, is this just milk and sugar?
Ok, um, why don't we just finish the game? Michael, it's your shot.
He's not here. I don't know where he is.
Oh, I can't do lunch. I was just sending you an email. Jim and I need to leave early today to meet with our contractor.
[to an off camera waiter and still clutching Jim's beer] Can I get a drink?
Jim set up a job interview for me today in Philly. It's um, with a real estate company, which is a great fit for me because I live in a house and I know what a bathroom is. [laughs] I'm sorry, I am just very nervous because honestly this is all moving a lot faster than I expected. And, and because my resume can fit on a post-it note.
Andy's family had a total meltdown.  His dad blew through all their money and took off to Argentina with a younger woman.
I love [leans over Michael's desk to look at his computer screen]... this idea is neat. I've never been. It sounds lovely. [meanwhile Michael looks at the pictures Pam printed out]
Oh, hey, guys! I'd like to introduce you to a new little friend of mine.  His name is New Year's resolution board.
Well I don't think you're gonna be very happy with this.
I mean, we���ve having issues. It can���t hurt to talk about them, right?
Jan used to be one of my superiors, and she is one of the most erratic and terrifying people I have ever met.
No, I'm kidding. Um, so you got big plans this weekend?
I'm supposed to be Olive Oyl. And it makes more sense when I'm standing next to Popeye, but... Jim doesn't want to put his costume on.
Oh, thank you.  Is that um, I can't tell if I'm really producing.  I don't know if she's getting anything.
I don't know, I didn't read it carefully, I just saw 'congratulations' and I skimmed the list, I saw my name, I came in here to tell you and get a snack.
It says ���Lotto Pool���, right on top. [points to obvious title]
[Michael walks in dressed as Willy Wonka] Good morning, Michael.
Well the breadsticks are like what then, Ryan, what can I use?
No. I mean, I don't know, I don't think so.
[sees Ryan coming through door] Hey Ryan. Welcome back --
You can flirt with someone to get what you want and also be attracted to them. How do you think we got together?
Cece was around 22 weeks, but Phillip was much earlier.
Yeah.  Wait, what, the mess or the note?
[on phone] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh hi, David. He's having a colonoscopy. Alright, I'll find out if he's out yet.
But I've learned to love again. [puts her arm on Jim's shoulder] He's a cartoon sailor.
Something's up with Jim and Karen.  Not that I've been eavesdropping.  It's not really any of my business, but I've gotten pretty good at reading the back of Jim's neck.
So we're planning this party for Nellie, and we're gonna make it really bad.
The thing I like most about Recyclops is that he's creating a different world for our child.
Listen, um��� I was scared, you know? I loved what I had, and I didn���t want to risk it. And I think that maybe I did doubt him a little too. Which was wrong because he���s shown me time and again. But when the documentary started airing, people on the street told me that I had this fairy-tale romance. But there were a lot of times last year where it did not feel like a fairy tale. But then it got deeper, and it got stronger and now it���s better than a fairy tale. It���s like a long book that you never want to end.  And you���re fine with that because you just never, ever wanna leave it.
About 40 times a year, Michael gets really sick, but has no symptoms. Dwight is always gravely concerned.
Hi..  I was just coming out to see what you were doing and to maybe stop you.
You know what? It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.
Is it... is it pebbles from that beach in Jamaica? [she shakes it]
I needed leverage so I pulled those pictures off the internet. It's just this Office Administrator thing, I don't wanna...
Oh Jim, I don't think you're going to abandon this party here all by itself.
I know, but I can't cover reception. I have a ton of work to do.
I am going to tell her, but now is clearly not the time.  I will buy her a wig, we'll have a few laughs. There's a right way to do this.
Ok, well it wasn't obvious so... [phone hangs up]
We can't help you if you don't just tell us what happened.
Oh, do you want me to repeat the messages that I gave you before for the... [nods toward camera]
Hey, Dwight. Jim and I found your wallet in the parking lot.
Uh, no, I um. Everything's pretty much the same here.
Todd, you're just saying insults in the form of an apology.
For the past few months I've been sending Dwight letters from the CIA. [hands a folder to Jim]
Yes. But, what I didn't tell you is that I actually bought the tickets. We only didn't go because it was-
[laughs] No. The Odd Life of Timothy Green.
Hey, why is it so quiet? Shouldn't the phone be ringing? Uh-oh. Erin set the phone to voicemail.
She's just, she's really tentative about latching, and I just, I want to keep her self-esteem up.
I don't know, I think I was just staring at my desk.
Well, you have to choose a food option and there's information in there about directions and lodging...
This isn't about sides. This is about me seeing a blueish gray old man in the mirror and then he vanishes.
Mmm! Good pate, right? [Matt nods yes] Oscar made it. Have you met Oscar?
Oh, hey Michael! I'm just going to go to Carbondale to price some shredders. I'll see you later.
We discuss... [Angela and Phyllis giggle] the idea of doing the party totally normal. Like, not mean. Just a regular party. [giggling stops] Not mean.
Describe him exactly. What color mustard is his shirt? Yellow or Dijon?
Michael likes me to run the camera when he makes his apology videos. My favorite is the one for his mother.
You missed two big conference calls today, one with corporate.
Yeah, that's right.  We could do a three-day weekend.  I wonder if I could, like, call in sick on the Friday.  Then I get a four-day weekend.
Oh.  I think you should get it.  You've changed a lot and you'd be good at it.
I was hoping for a righteous mob, and I ended up with Dwight and Nellie. But, they both have a mob mentality. And, I'm pretty sure Dwight has a pitchfork in his car.
Oh, no. Um, I, I'm embarrassed. It's stupid.
This is where I used to keep my computer.
I just did not realize how hard it was gonna be without Jim. I mean, I really respect you for being a single mom all these years. It whipped my ass in half a week. I have to say, there are not a lot of people who could pull off a shaved head, but you are rocking it.
No, it's not that. Um, I was just wondering, since I'm probably going to have to stay late, could you ask Dwight to stay late too so he can walk me to my car?
Do I at least get to go with you in this fantasy?
Wow. Your voice is as lovely as ever.
I used to be young and cute and sorta funny and I could do those cute, little cartoons. And everyone who came through here was like, ���Who���s that receptionist? I like her.��� Now I���m just a fat mom. Yeah, and you take one look at me and you���re like, ���Oh, loser.���
Oh, I don't know... [Jim laughs, phone rings] Oh my God.  This is Jan's cell.
Michael has so many pictures of his kids he had to get two phones with two numbers and he pays two bills.
Does this have anything to do with what you were talking to Andy about?
What are you going to do with your time off?
And I guarantee, that you will be satisfied! 'Cause your satisfaction is our guarantee! We guarantee it. We look forward to doing business with you too. Thank you Russell.
So, you know it means I have to go to New York for three months...
I could work here. I could see this.
Oh my gosh, wait until you. This guy was unbelievable. Ok so-
You know what? I'm gonna get a hose. Then we'll talk about it. Ok we'll figure it out. Be right back. Just stay there.
About when you want to give me more of your money?
Well, I���m heading out to Cece���s dance recital.
I���m an oncologist and you are a dog.
When a child gets behind the wheel of a car and runs into a tree, You don't blame the child.  He didn't know any better.  You blame the 30-year-old woman who got in the passenger seat and said, 'Drive, kid.  I trust you.'
Sold out? That has never happened in the history of jinx.
I guess some new people might be coming from Stamford. Should be fun. New blood.
What if I back out and you finish the pitch with Jim?
[walking through the office, notices Andy with Erin's computer set up at his desk] What the heck! Why do you have Erin's computer!
You don't have to wait that long. I mean, you don't have to wait a month to ask her out. Just ask her out.
Okay. So I went on the Internet, and she is not gonna find another apartment for that price. I mean this one is twice as much, and it doesn't have parking. Does she like to park?
That's OK. I don't feel like answering phones.
Mo Chuisle. He's watching Million Dollar Baby... He's gonna try to kill me.
Uh, could I please have your attention? So a year ago, I got my first art commission to paint a mural for Dunder Mifflin and I decided to paint the history of paper���,which was just some trees and stuff. And then someone spray painted a bunch of butts on it and I had to start from the beginning. But it all worked out for the best because I think that I���ve painted the perfect thing which is the history of us. All of us. And this is for you Jim. [applause] And go ahead! [drape drops and everyone cheers]
Ok, well, sometimes the gift is really about the gesture, you know, like what it means, instead of what it is.
Phyllis... ended up using the exact same invitations as Roy and me. So it was kind of like being invited to my own wedding. And I was like 'Wait, thought I called that off'.
Michael, there's a Charles Miner here to see you.
Yes, but David Wallace does. And he asked me to gather everyone to talk about stuff... That's gonna be revealed once we're in the conference room for the meeting.
Well, we're thinking of my grandmother who we haven't told and is very old-fashioned.
[on the phone] Michael, it's Ryan for you.
Oh no, I was confused by your phrasing.  You should definitely go out with Jim.  I mean, you're going out with Jim.  I'm not going out with Jim.  You're dating him, which is awesome, because you guys are great together.
I don't know how I fit in with these women. Here. Or with Jan. Um... I mean we get along great. Fine. Um... I guess the person I have the most in common with is...
Apparently Michael has come up with a Dunder Mifflin Mad Lib, and he's making us play it with him. We are so happy. No. I'd like to choose a different adjective.
We did that. So, what's next? Michael, just stop for a second. [reaches out to take the whisk] Michael. Stop for a second.
Ok. I was thinking about wearing it down. Kind of like, I don't know, like loose with big curls and...
[whispering] No, no, no, you have to do it-
Thanks! Yeah, so I'm just going to take care of things around the office and get paid a reasonable salary. You believe that, right?
Um, I think I'm gonna be up at the lake.
[On phone] About 10 minutes ago. No, I didn't know what to say.  Yes, I know.  Um, I don't know, mom, he's my best friend.  Yeah, he's great.  Yeah, I think I am. [Jim enters] I have to go. I will. Listen, Jim... [They kiss]
Yeah, I would've. What about you? Come on, there's gotta be something. Between your birth and the last two days, something you just haven't had the chance to tell me.
I figured I'd catch you walking to your car, but...
I think so.  I don't know, I was mainly focused on the cup holders.
Stop eating it! Do you wanna be happy? Look at you. You have a major self-destructive streak in you.
Oscar thinks that having a dog is just like having a baby.
You need to be more upset about this. She's your mother too now. Your mother is sleeping with Michael Scott.
Or you proved that he thinks you're gay.
[everyone cheers as Meredith spins and lands on ���tiny wheel���] The tiny wheel actually does have chores. It���s so cute no one seems to mind.
Oh, I love Chuck Close and his photo-realist paintings. But I have to work.
When Jim decided to come back to Scranton full-time, I was relieved, but I also feel a little guilty. I mean, he���s giving up this big thing for me. But he seems happy. I mean, he���s certainly been goofing around a lot. I love goofy Jim.
Oh I will. I will Kevin. I will make that my top priority.
Oh! Gossip, who is it? Who is it? Who is it, Michael? ...Who?
No. It was a total waste of time. Um... it was fun, though, because I got to spend the day with Andy Bernard. He's really cool.
They're both single, I have a sense they might-
[turns around, is wearing a mustache] Bye, Stanley! Love you! [waves, Stanley leaves]
I'm sure it's fine. it's a blue shirt.
[putting mayo on Creed's head] Creed, I'm all done. My turn.
All right. You can go. Give him his gum.
Yes. You guys, I have the perfect idea. Ok, it will just take me ten minutes.
I feel like [Pam look's out the window and camera pans out in The Office]--Dwight is holding a candle and reading a poem.
Alright, I will get a card at the hospital and we'll sign it outside her room.
Everyone from work is here. We weren't planning on that.
Oh, we wanted to, but our sitter just fell through. I'm really sorry.
As soon as they leave, well get Kelly and start.
Oscar's pate is great. I could eat it all day, every day. Mmm. How come the good ones are never straight, right?
Oh! I'm going into labor! Oh my goodness!
There's some filing, restocking the supply shelves. Replacing the water jug, which nobody likes to do. Um, we... uh, eat a lot of cake!
Except where Juliet doesn't have that great a time and Romeo doesn't call back after two dates.
Yes, I found it in a shelf in the corner of the warehouse. [Darryl gives the camera an odd look]
Of course. He's one of my closest friends.
You know, I just think it's really important that you be productive today.
Wow, this place is��� so great. I had no idea ��� on the phone, you made it sound kind of dinky.
[Pam and Jim hear Dwight crying] Ugh, your turn.
I think maybe there actually is something I don't know about Jim.
What is it? [Jim lifts the hog maw with a fork] Don't touch it.
But Andy does, so we have to watch it with him.
It's performance review day, company-wide.  Last year, my performance review started with Michael asking me what my hopes and dreams were, and it ended with him telling me he could bench-press 190 pounds.  So, I don't really know what to expect.
[reading flavors] Despera-dough. Witchy-womanilla. Why do they do this?
So, does anyone wanna know where I've been for the last 2 hours?
Robert! Okay, oops! I deleted them all. They���re all deleted.
[looks at to Jim] I am. [looks at Angela] It's about the Save The Date.
Um, excuse me. I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
Mema's not coming to the wedding. She's leaving tomorrow morning.
Let me just say, you've been promising me this chair since the day you hired me.
[Jim hits a ceiling panel] I don't think he's in the ceiling, babe.
I think you're thinking of The Hunt for Red October.
Um, actually, funny story -- I didn���t get it. I shouldn���t have been so cocky about my rectangle-holding skills after all.
I was in the meeting with Jan and she did say that it could be this branch that gets the axe.
[to Michael who is looking at a chair catalog] Did you pick a new chair? It's been awhile.
It's been a really rough couple of days... This helps a little.
Yup! [Tom and Pete give Halpertian looks to camera]
Michael, I... [sits down] I hate to say this, but... you know this special bond that you've always felt with Ryan, where, like, you're best friends or you're his mentor or something?
I know! No, I'm saying that when I feel overwhelmed, something I like to do is make a list. Make a list of things to do and then start with the easy stuff.
It's good. But won't it feel weird cutting into a cross?
After you talked, he called my mom and said he was gonna look for an apartment.
[hesitates] I am. I am the office administrator!
What? What is it? What? What is, oh, my God! [Jim starts attacking snowmen] Honey? Jim? Jim!
Oh, my God! It's incredible. [Jim reaches and steals his card back before she can notice it] Is this the Boggle timer?
I'm gonna need the name and cell phone number of the housekeeper responsible for changing the sheets, please.
Oh, I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
That's a very rude thing to say, Kevin.
Sorry. Um, David is in Vermont. Did you speak with him? He sent Dwight instead.
[looking out the window at Dwight washing the car]  Awww, he did that for me?
I was just going to go down to the hotel bar for a little bit.
Sick, like lots of sniffling. I don't know.
No, just do one. Two question marks is kind of aggressive. You know it's like wha-what?? Just do one.
I just feel kind of tired, you know.
No, nothing.  Nothing Michael!  Just saying hi. [Michael waves 'hi' at the phone]
Frank and beans! [both laugh] So what'd we decide for Michael, the bottle of rum, or the seashell alarm clock?
Um... I just wanted to say that... Just, my Mom's coming in today.
Yay Kevin. Whoo hoo for Kevin! For stinking up the bathroom.
Look, I really need this new chair. I mean, seriously, how is it possible that in five years I've had two engagement rings, and only one chair?
I'm sorry too.  I just, I think that we both made some bad choices.
Aw, that's so sweet! [dart fires out of box and lodges in ceiling]
Hey, I���m the one who has to sit next to this weirdo when Jim���s away. I���m in a position where I���m rooting for Nate, and that just feels wrong. [sighs] Forget it.  I need to work on my mural. I have some pointy trees that I need to round off.
Not almost, though, Holly. I mean, not -- not close to 200...
[to Jim] Why don't you talk to him about it?
Do you mean, leaves as in dies? You want us to throw Toby a New Orleans' funeral?
I really don't want to talk about it.  I don't mean to be rude, but I just... I don't want to comment on what happened.  It
Yeah. No, no, I'll um-- the hundred. I'll just take the hundred.
Hey, Karen. Sorry about that meeting today, that was really crazy.
So, umm, is this your first office job then?
If I'm being completely honest, I could've done without the belly kiss.
[phone rings, Pam answers] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.  Just one moment, I'll transfer you.
Sometimes there's a lot of time between the calls.
Please? Just make sure he's OK? [Jim climbs through hatch]
Kevin, at most you���re saving a microscopic amount of time.
Fine! [eggs splatter all over his robe] Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Yeah, I think I made the right choice.
And we'd like to offer you 15% off your first purchase as our way of welcoming you to the area.
It's nice. It's funny. It mentions his tonsillectomy and makes a funny little joke about his moustache.
Ok, that's uh, good news [Pam sees Angela eavesdropping] Uh, yeah, no I'll let you go.
Yeah. Hey, would you excuse me for a second?
[mimicing Katy] Oh definitely, definitely step in and out of it like that.
Um, no, I was just, um, just having a cup of coffee, kind of warming up for the day.
[voicemail message for Jim] I'll transfer you.  Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.  Hold, please.  Dunder Mifflin, this is ... okay, sorry.  Michael was standing at my desk, and I needed to be busy or who knows what would've happened, so thank you.
That's, um... I hadn't thought about it, huh.
Dunder Miff...Michael Scott Paper Company, this is Pam. Oh, hi Russell from the pancake luncheon, how are you? Well we'd like to do business with you too! How can we make that happen?
It's perfect. You emphasized the golf, completely omit the Florida.
I don't know if I'm gonna make any money with art.
Ha ha. That���d be great. Kind of like ditching school, except instead of getting suspended, you get��� What do you get? Oh my god! Why didn���t I think of this? Andy���s not here. Oh, hey, Erin, um, I���m expecting a shipment of pens. Can you cover that?
Why did I get in the car?  I could of struggled.  I have a whistle in my purse I didn't even blow it.
No, you should go for it. I mean nothing would've happened with me and Jim if he didn't put himself out there.
Perfect boobs, [gives a look at the camera] of course I remember Holly.
[in Meredith's van] I have never seen so many parking tickets.
I think they're even. At various times you gave Jim ten points, Dwight a gold star, and Stanley a thumbs up. And I don't really know how to compare those units.
Oh my God, I think we've been robbed!
Hey Michael, would you get me some coffee from the warehouse?
Hey, I would just love to schedule a meeting today with Dwight.
The two people with the lowest sales in the quarter have to do them.
I don't know if there's really a private place in this office.
You told me to buzz you about the suggestion box meeting when Jan was here.
I'm sorry, Michael. I need you to say it. I'm so sorry.
And, I feel God in this Chili's tonight. WHOOOOOOOO!!!!
Because if I had spoken my truth sooner about not wanting to move to Philly, then maybe we wouldn't have had this opportunity for couple's therapy.
You know, stuff people didn't intend for everyone to see. And they kinda want to know how much.
It's impractical. I'm not going to try to get a house like that. Um... they don't even make houses like that in Scranton. So, I'm never going to... .
I don't know I'm really committed to winning.
You know, Angela, you don't have to come to the wedding.
I don't think any of them are supposed to shred magazines.
Wait. Can you back up? What's the story?
I have this kind of big secret about Angela. And I've been really nice to her... and I haven't told anyone. And what the hell?!
Do you think that you could send in your RSVP card?
I know. It's just even if it was, a great boss and a great job, I just, I don't know, I don't know if I want, um, I don't know if I want this.
I need to get out of this dress.
Because she's conflicted.  She has to be professional, but she's fighting feelings... for you.
How would wiping it with a paper towel make it worse?
It all started when Dwight was tapping his foot against the leg of his desk. When I asked him to stop, he said, 'I will when you lose the baby weight.'
I mean it's a very competitive field. But I have a professor who says I have a lot of promise, and if I don't try now, I never will. So...
[to everyone in conference room] I have terrible news. Someone defaced my mural. They painted all over it.
I worked until about 2:45 AM. And then I had to decide if I wanted to spend the night with Michael editing in his office, and Dwight watching Michael edit in his office, or drive home and probably fall asleep at the wheel and die in a fiery car wreck. I passed out on my keyboard trying to decide.
Yeah, its nuts. But I don't know what else to do.
[screams out in the parking lot, Michael watches from his office window]
Wow! He really pulled out the big guns. Fake crying. Did not expect that.
Michael Scott's Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton, Meredith Palmer memorial, celebrity rabies awareness, fun run race for the cure, this is Pam.
It's possible that some people thought it was your birthday.
Michael, Michael, wait we don't have, we don't have the budget for another party.
I know it's wrong to fake going into labor just to get out of things, but sometimes it's necessary.
And he wanted Jim to be a part of it too.
They say if you're nervous around someone you should picture them naked. I do not recommend this strategy. Try picturing them with more clothes on... or a funny coat.
[to Ryan] I'll take those. Thanks. [throws jeans under her desk]
Well I just want to take a minute to talk to you all about something very serious. Once every hour, someone is involved in an internet scam. That man is Michael Scott. [laughter] He's supporting about 20 Nigerian princesses.
Come on, it'll be fun, and besides, I'm a roulette expert.
Jim and I are pretty sure she had an affair with her ex-assistant Hunter. He was 17. But she looks great. If she asks, will you tell her I said that?
When are you ever responsible for your actions?
So, let's say my teeth turn to liquid and then, they drip down the back of my throat. What would you call that?
Well, I though we were saving money for the wedding, but apparently Roy thought it was more important to buy two WaveRunners. I don't really ever get to use the other WaveRunner that's supposed to be mine because his brother uses it and they race.
Yeah, she has a good point.  I mean, for example, with the last thing you said, by the time you explained it, it actually took up more time.
[getting out of the car] What are we doing at your parent's house?
[surveying an untidy office] The building���s custodian is on vacation for the month and Dwight is too cheap to hire a replacement. So, instead, we���re living in filth. But, not for long. Because I have created the chore wheel.
Michael just rented The Devil Wears Prada. He has his NetFlix sent here to the office, and he watches them in pieces when things are slow.
Ok, wait, so that would make me [walks to side of room] like right here.
Um, I can offer you free delivery on any order that you place today. Okay, twenty boxes? I can do... just a second. I can do 20 boxes at 43 dollars a box. Great!
Because everything makes me cry, so what���s the difference? This dog, he just wants to protect his bone.
[going up to give Dwight a hug] Thanks for much for helping the company, Dwight.
I'm really happy to be back with Roy. I think it shows maturity. Maturity and dignity. ... Is that braggy? I don't mean it to be braggy.
Maybe we can get him to hide and wait somewhere.
You know what, Dwight? Let me just check the bathroom first. Okay?
I thought we were having a nice time.
Hey, Angela.[hands her a Save The Date card] I didn't have your zip code.
New York, as it turns out, is very expensive, and I ran out of money. I thought about selling a kidney, but Michael offered to get me a part-time job at corporate.
I'm taking a computer animation class so I could try to do a logo.
I had just woken up. I didn't look cute. That's how I knew he meant it.
Jan called. She's coming in later to talk to you.
Anyone want to see the video from Cece���s recital?
Hey, Michael, where have you been? [Michael shoots pool ball up into their faces]
We were hoping you could do something like this���
Okay, let���s stop here. Anyone have any thoughts?
[accent] It wasn't me.  I'm not goin' down for this!
Jim's been spending a few days a week in Philly and I'm not gonna lie, it's been challenging. Yesterday, things took a turn for the worse. I found out Cece has lice. So I was up all night disinfecting every sheet, towel, toy, item of clothing in the entire house. I'm exhausted. But don't tell Jim. He has a huge meeting today, under a lot of pressure and he's doing it all for the family.
I wish that you'd stop rubbing that lamp in that creepy way.
OK. What does he like? What's important to him? Does he have like a favorite pair of boots or a lunch box or...
We were wondering if you would like to have dinner with us tonight, in our home, and play with our baby.
I don't have any DUI's so I can drive myself, but thanks.
I've heard that. [reaches down to pick up bagel from the floor]
Hi, um. I'm sorry, do you have a minute? Is this a bad time?
What's going on? Do you know that guy?
For the record? Not on board with fake Stanley... although, I get it.
I'm setting Michael up with my land lady. She's really sweet and... whatever, I just can't take Michael like this.
What are you talking about? Yes we can.
You just... You look good. Your shirt looks... You look real good.
I, I was gonna say, I think that um, we're gonna help Roy's cousin move.
Oh! Yes! [Group cheers, Dwight moves to driver seat]
Michael. Okay, I'm... I'm going to talk straight to you because I think you need to hear it. Michael.
[breathes deeply and runs across coals] Oooh, uh hah, ooh! Wha-hoo! Ahhhh...
That's a really... well fine,  Do the German instructions say what this is supposed to do?
[sighs] Oh, I���m sorry. I feel like you���ve already been working insanely hard.
Um, Fargo, um, Edward Scissorhands, Dazed and Confused...
Oh, hey, don't fill up on chocolates. I made us a lunch reservation at State Street Grill.
Bring her to the party. Yeah, we'll have Santa, and we'll play games with her. It'll be a lot of fun.
[to Roy as Jim escapes into bathroom] Are you kidding?
[looks at beers] Oh. [Starts to walk away, turns around] No. Actually, one of these is supposed to be a lite.
Michael, I think that feeling only goes one way. And I think that Ryan knows that, and he's taking advantage of you.
Sure, but we should get to the bottom of this. Let's pick a rumor and trace it back to the beginning.
Erin, it's not up to you. This computer was for reception! Okay? It's not yours to give away.
Okay. You know the test booklets that they give out in all the schools. I was thinking that we could put a coupon in the back that people would mail in to us... and as, you know, as I tell it, I don't like it. Unless, of course, you are responding to it.
Okay, so, when you���re selling to this woman, just imagine that she���s that nice, reasonable barber.
Then I'm gonna run fast in the middle.
He told me how he felt and I guess I had feelings too, and we kissed.
I recently met Sue, the office administrator at Vance Refrigeration. She has this awesome wall full of fun initiatives and morale boosters and stuff. Sue just goes for it, she's awesome.
Hey. You have a bunch of messages and... [sees Michael shaking head with beads in hair] that's nice. Hannah quit while you were gone. I guess she memo-ed to file some complaints she had about being a working mother? And so you might also have to be deposed.
I can't see them when they're on the floor
Okay. Look at this, look at this. Baby picture.
Yeah, but we don't have a power cord.
Yeah, I needed to take care of some stuff.
I know, you don't like to be frazzled.
No Dwight, not the good peanut butter. People are going to get mad.
[whispering] Hello? Yes, this is Pam Halpert. I got the mural? [Loudly] Oh, my God!
Okay, you do not have to do this.
You think your doctor's going to give you a C-section at six months?
Nellie, why don���t you  tell Dwight what we were doing earlier today. And Dwight, you show us that you���re listening.
Well, I remember why I dress the way I do at work.  But I'm gonna keep the clothes.  I mean, it'll be cool to just have some after work clothes that aren't pajamas.
Here's what I was thinking: everyone sits on a chair every day...
Okay, you guys, have fun. You too, Andy.
Yeah. I have my copies. [holds up messed up copies]
I have one idea of what it means.
I love you so much. [starting to cry]
She doesn't want you to return the barrette. She's not interested in you.
I don't know. It seems like a lot for an a cappella group from a college we never went to.
Sometimes Michael gets nostalgic and he talks about the classic gang. That's Michael, me, Jim, Dwight, Angela, Kevin, Oscar, Stanley, Phyllis, Creed, Meredith, Kelly and Ryan. We're a regular Ocean's Eleven.
It's like squishing a spider under a book.  It's gonna be really gross but I have to look and make sure that it's really dead.  Sooo... [to camera guys] If you guys see anything... ?
Jim had a crush on me on the booze cruise or he told you about it on the booze cruise?
Hey, here's your schedule for next week. Are you okay?
So, um, Michael needs us in the conference room.
I have Ben Nugent on the line, he is the top salesman in Utica.
I got her.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay...  Jim!  She latched!  She latched.
No, no. 'Cause the ice melts and then it's like second drink! [laughs]
How are you, Isaac? You have something in your ear.
Nope, I don't have a card, but I'll do you one better. A little scrap of paper.
[sees Ryan on the horse] Oh, boo! Boo! Boo to you! Boo!
Yeah, and there's this one when we were listening to music and it's like, it's like w were in love and we didn't even know we were in love and it's...but- Do you think Jim's changed?
Thank you.  Um, listen I just wanted to confirm that you're not coming to the wedding, which is totally understandable and more than fine.
Michael, I think that as the boss you should really---
My husband would tell you to go for it.
I am-- I am-- I am trying to make everything perfect here, okay? So that you can have everything that you want.
Coming to Scranton. Is anyone coming to Scranton?
So how much antigravity potion do you want?
Oscar said WUPHF only has enough money for nine days.
Okay, well I have the tablecloth, don't forget the flatware.
No.  I read in the book about nipple confusion.
[on phone] No, he hasn't picked one yet.
No. Thanks... uh we're still having lunch today, right?
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. No, no, no, no.
[placing a coke can in front of Jim] Here. [Jim looks confused] Just buy it from me. I haven't talked to you in hours and it's been weird and I really want to know what the hell's going on with Dwight. [Pam scoots the coke can towards Jim.  Jim pulls out his wallet and hands Pam a dollar.  He gives the coke back to Pam]
Uh, I have to stay here and answer the phone.
Oh, my God.  I didn't even have to do the 'C thing.'
I don���t think you guys understand why we���re doing this. It���s-
They came up with that idea really fast.
Jada, Darryl, I'm so glad I found you guys. A grinch stole the star from on top of the Christmas tree and is hiding it in the warehouse somewhere. You want to go help me find him?
Cupcake. It's cupcakes and strippers all the way down.
Well, Dwight had this idea, and I thought it was kind of crazy. But maybe that's where we are now.
No, the doctor said every five to seven minutes.
Yeah, that might be weird. Overall though, we still all have our jobs... so, good news, right?
[on phone with Jim] He said, 'I did like Dwight'? He's gonna fire him.
I... listen, umm, we're still good for this weekend, right?
So, check this out. According to the handbook, you could make more money as a salesman than as a manager. They have all these incentive programs. I ran your numbers from last year.
I cannot wait for that joke to be over.
Oh, yeah, we were. We were just looking to say hi. So hey.
I lied it's personal. It's about me and Jim. We're... I just... you're the only person I can talk to.
And we know how he died.  Flying into the glass doors.  But you know what?  I don't think he was being stupid.  I think he just really, really wanted to come inside our building to spread his cheer and lift our spirits with a song.
No, I didn't mind helping Jim with his problem. That's what friends do. I help Phyllis all the time. Just yesterday, I untangled a piece of tape from her hair. So, yeah.
Okay. It's been a little more tiring than I thought.
Here's what we think happened.  Michael's sidekick, who all through the movie is this complete idiot who's causing the downfall of the United States, was originally named Dwight.  But then Michael changed it to Samuel L. Chang using a search and replace, but that doesn't work on misspelled words, leaving behind one Dwigt.  And Dwight figured it out.  Oops.
Is there-- um... you want to ease up a little bit?
I think she looks good. Now that she���s wearing sports bras, we don���t see her boobs as much.
You mean the frozen mice for the piranha?
You could have just told us what you were thinking.
My job?  My job is to get married in the morning.  That's my job.
Ben Franklin, do you wear boxers, briefs, or pantaloons?
