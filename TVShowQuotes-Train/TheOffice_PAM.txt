Jim does a really good one. Do yours.
[after Angela gives her a stack of files]: I'm going into labor!
Michael Scott's Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton, Meredith Palmer memorial, celebrity rabies awareness, fun run race for the cure, this is Pam.
[to Michael] Oh, would that make you feel better?
Listen, when Jim was dating Karen, I didn't want to come to work. It was awful. I hated it. I wanted to quit, but-
[in Jim's ear] Ask how he's doing since the breakup.
And then, out of that cake, pops another stripper holding a smaller cake. And then an even smaller stripper pops out of that one.
Darryl, oh, my gosh. How is Austin? Tell me everything. How���s the merger? I feel like I read about Athlead all the time.
I mean, I know that we said no big gifts, but I was kind of hoping you'd get me
[On phone] Oh, great! Yeah, um, I'll get right back to you. [hangs up] Hey guys! Anyone ever heard of Iris Black on the radio?
Are you okay, Kevin? [Kevin gives thumbs down]
Good morning, Mr. Wonka, here are your messages.
Hey, Michael, where have you been? [Michael shoots pool ball up into their faces]
Yeah, but I mean, if you really like this person, then you should see where it goes.
Ceramics class. Then dinner by myself. I'm gonna watch HGTV and maybe go to Bungalow 8 with John Mayer.
I'm taking a computer animation class so I could try to do a logo.
Like the main company number? Because I'm gonna have to call information.
OK. New topic. Kelly, how are things with Ryan?
I almost lost it. That was too good.
You know, when Holly gets back, everyone will tell her what a great job you did. And then she'll realize what she's missing.
I just helped someone out. It feels good.
Hey, Erin. Do you mind faxing this for me?
Can we take a look at the suite now?
Yes, of course, we could've just been doing this the whole time, but SOMEONE dropped the ball.
Oh, my God. When Dwight said no one wants to come in on a Saturday...
Well, you know... they don't call me the Bart Simpson of Scranton for nothing.
Okay, they're almost here- What? Come on. If you guys are gonna be mean, could you at least be subtle? [rips down ugly photo of Nellie]
I have a ton of stuff to do for the wedding. And I have to do it in the office. And that can be kind of awkward. Um... just because people can get all weird about wedding stuff. Then... I just... I don't want to offend... Angela... or someone.
Oh, well, thanks Oscar.  I was just wondering how would you feel if Michael was sleeping with your mom?
Wait! What you should do, Michael, is have a doctor take a look at it. Because we really don't know what that is.
The Senator? [Oscar nods] He was married before, and he has a kid.
Michael, you've had two ideas today. And one of them was great. And the other one was terrible.
No, he's actually been really nice and helpful.
[Nate starts walking away from hornet's nest, puts down the blowtorch] Yes!
We found a great local daycare. It's rated really high by all the local parenting websites. But that means it's also really hard to get into.
Yes. But don't get too excited, 'cause I didn't have a lot of time this year.
Oh, no, it's just that if a vampire had to cough, he would do it like this. [coughs into elbow]
Sometimes there's a lot of time between the calls.
[holds up rice krispie shaped like a star] In the name of Nutcracker Christmas.
I need to get out of this dress.
Andy, why should she have your crappy computer?
it���s okay. You can sit in the annex.
I just wanted to get out of my room for a little while.
Not that I call myself an impressionist, per se.
Mm. [walks into bathroom, Meredith is using her brest pump] Meredith!
[points to smoke] Oh, my God! Uh, Oh my God!
I think maybe there actually is something I don't know about Jim.
Hey Michael, um... about three months ago, I was talking to... [Michael grabs form and signs it without reading.]
I actually might not go. Feeling kind of tired.
Hey, Abby! Do you want to help me shred some old documents? It's actually pretty cool.
It's good. But won't it feel weird cutting into a cross?
Michael, I think that what Stanley did to you was rude.  Maybe you should just get him aside and tell him that he was behaving badly.
Do you mind if I go out for a drink with these guys?
Hmm. I think Jim���s lying to me about not being attracted to Cathy.
Why did I get in the car?  I could of struggled.  I have a whistle in my purse I didn't even blow it.
Maybe we can get him to hide and wait somewhere.
I love you so much. [starting to cry]
And also there is no such thing as a rabies doctor.
Ok, well it wasn't obvious so... [phone hangs up]
Hey, here's your schedule for next week. Are you okay?
Try paperclips. Oh wait. This message. For Dwight.
Yeah, enjoy this moment, because you're never going to go back to this time before you met your desk mate Dwight.
[to delivery men] Uh, hi, can I help you? I don't think anyone here-
Well, looks like he really did just want to talk about the issues. i'm Sorry Oscar.
Yeah? [stops laughing] It was though, that's what happened.
Well, a gay man would not leave the store wearing those shoes!
Is this because Jim walked in on you going to the bathroom?
I know we're having that harassment thing this afternoon.
And don't say that thing about how lots of gay guys have kids.
Listen, are you bringing anyone to Jim's party tonight?
A party. It's not an excuse to get really drunk or confront someone or have a cathartic experience of any kind.
Great. Well, Let me know if you need a new chair, or anything that an Office Administrator can handle.
[to Jim] Hey! You can just give her your extension.
Andy's family had a total meltdown.  His dad blew through all their money and took off to Argentina with a younger woman.
Oscar, no. This is not the time for one of your principled stands.
Hey, where's Dwight? He should be a part of this. Has he been acting kinda weird to you lately?
[On phone] About 10 minutes ago. No, I didn't know what to say.  Yes, I know.  Um, I don't know, mom, he's my best friend.  Yeah, he's great.  Yeah, I think I am. [Jim enters] I have to go. I will. Listen, Jim... [They kiss]
I'd also like to say a few words if that's okay.
No, I mean, just 'cause we like got along so well.
Jim, I don't want the first thing the baby hears to be the 8 Mile soundtrack.
And we need bodies in both these rooms, people. So please sign up.
I know you Michael, I saw you naked.
I have this little vacuum cleaner that's broken.  If Dwight doesn't work out, maybe that could be manager.
Dwight, you may find this hard to believe, but I love my boring life.
I guess that's why we have a temp, huh?
Three hours from now or three hours from earlier like 4:00?
Don't take this the wrong way, but... you should go for that job.
Hey, have I told you you look really nice today?
[Jim comes out of the office]  What's the news?
Is there-- um... you want to ease up a little bit?
Man, Angela really had a hold on him. [Dwight playing the recorder in the background]  Angela.
I'm just gonna sit here for a little bit longer if that's okay. The air smells so good. I don't remember it smelling so good. The chairs are so comfortable.
Well, as I am sure you know, for the past few months, I've been the Office Administrator. Since right before you guys took over.
[goes to change thermostat as Dwight puts a locked cover over it] Hey. What are you doing?
Yeah. I have my copies. [holds up messed up copies]
Come on, let's go. I wanna call your doctor.
Guess what poster he had on his wall?
It was a ghost, I told you this on, like, our first date.
We were supposed to go to the barbeque at Jim's house.
Oh my God, I think we've been robbed!
Because I'm never gonna act like that, even in your fantasy.
Oh... um... no.  That's... um... That's actually fine
I really don't want to talk about it.  I don't mean to be rude, but I just... I don't want to comment on what happened.  It
Yeah, that's weird. I thought they only played the Police.
Dwight, what are you doing!? We've only been in here for, like, two seconds!
Oh, oh my gosh. Yes, but don't, don't say anything, okay? It's after my grandfather.
Ravi, our amazing pediatrician, was asking us if we knew any girls and I said I know the perfect girl.
Yes, and then we decided that was crazy.
Well the breadsticks are like what then, Ryan, what can I use?
What? [Jim shakes his head] Did you want to tell me something? You look like you want to tell me something. [Jim shakes his head no] You look like you have something really important to say and you just can't for some reason. [Jim smiles] Come on, you can tell me. Jim, you can tell me anything. [Jim stops smiling and looks down. Pam wonders what that means]
Okay. [walks to conference room with Andy and stares at the sign up sheet with wonder] When did people sign-
So, um... we'll do it after work.  In the parking lot.  In front of everyone.  I'm going to hit you as hard as I can.
[on the phone] No, no, I know that the warranty's expired, but isn't it supposed to last longer than two years if it isn't defective? OK, fine, three years.
Well, I appreciate that some opportunities can be unpleasant- [Jim's phone rings, he answers]
Tell me one thing about you I don't know.
So, um, Michael needs us in the conference room.
Good. Very good. [cell phone beeping]Oh���no! Here. It's, uh, a text from Andy. ���New special proj. Need fam tree for evbody. Really dig up dirt A.S.A.P.��� And then in parentheses, he wrote out ���as soon as possible.���
I know! No, I'm saying that when I feel overwhelmed, something I like to do is make a list. Make a list of things to do and then start with the easy stuff.
Well, I don't wanna speak for Jim, but, it's like pretty official. [Jim smiles]
[Breaks Roy's grip] No, I don't want to go, I don't want to.
He's a big Meryl Streep fan, so I shouldn't be surprised that he's identified with her character.
I don't know what to tell you, Jim, but I saw a ghost.
Yes, this is the only time I'm ever going to make this request.
Kevin, at most you���re saving a microscopic amount of time.
Oh, it's Creed's birthday today.  Should we get him an ice-cream cake?  Mint chocolate chip?
Dunder Mifflin is having our first own garage sale. Like many Americans, we realized we had a lot of things that we really didn't need. And 10 cents of every dollar is going into the party fund so we can throw parties for ourselves.
[Dwight hands out handkerchief] Thanks. You don't need to stay here.
Okay, weirdo.  Come on.  It's time for cake.
I thought I was very specific about you not letting up a magician.
There is a master key and a spare key for the office. Dwight has them both. When I asked, 'What if you die Dwight, how will we get into the office?' He said, 'If I'm dead, you guys have been dead for weeks.'
I'm really happy to be back with Roy. I think it shows maturity. Maturity and dignity. ... Is that braggy? I don't mean it to be braggy.
Stealing? What am I supposed to have stolen?
Pretty crazy about Andy and Michelle Obama, huh?
I cannot wait for that joke to be over.
I have it covered. [hands Dwight a decorated box]
I really like Valentine's Day in this office. It's kinda like grade school. Everybody gives out little presents and stuff. Like last year, Jim gave me this card, with Dwight's head on it, it was horrifying and funny and...
[on phone] Yes! Yes! I would love to!
Give it back for what? What're you gonna do with it?
Hey, I was talking to Cathy. Turns out she is single.
No, this was the one thing I was supposed to be able to control, was this veil and-- [Jim cuts off half his tie]
Thank you! Thank you. I got it. Now I know. You thought I was a little dorky. You know? [gibberish sounds] Okay. Well, excuuuuse me.
I'm sure she's just confused. People scratch their heads when they're confused. Not always like an ape, the way Meredith just did, but it happens.
[yawns] Yeah, or no... well... I don't know. I'm sorry. I was up all night with Cece, otherwise I'd be running this.
Ben Franklin, do you wear boxers, briefs, or pantaloons?
Hey, why is it so quiet? Shouldn't the phone be ringing? Uh-oh. Erin set the phone to voicemail.
Is it... is it pebbles from that beach in Jamaica? [she shakes it]
Oscar, Toby, and I are founding members of the Finer Things Club.  We meet once a month to discuss books and art, celebrate culture in a very civilized way.  Sometimes the debate can get heated, but we're always respectful.  There is no paper, no plastic, and no work talk allowed.  It's very exclusive.
I'm coming back the wrong way.  [smiles at Jim across the parking lot] It's not because of you.  I don't like graphic design. That's it. [laughs] Stop smiling. I really didn't like it.  It's just designing logos and stuff.... and I miss Scranton.  But it is not because I missed you. I just really wanted to come home... and I know you said to come home the right way, but you can't tell me what to do. Got it?
You know, Angela, you don't have to come to the wedding.
And then every morning, I'd walk out on to my terrace and I would breathe in the inspiration of the city. You know? And just gather ideas for my painting...
Oscar's pate is great. I could eat it all day, every day. Mmm. How come the good ones are never straight, right?
Ok, for the record, I am pregnant and, obviously there has been some kind of a mistake, so why doesn't Jim just pick the next highest score on the list and we'll move on.
So, Melissa... I met your mom a couple times. She's
I'm serious. Um, I'm really glad I came.
This is weird with you facing the other way.
So the sports marketing business that Jim told everyone about except for me?
Every night, Jim and I watch an episode of The West Wing together on DVD.  Um, he wanted to watch Battlestar Galactica and I wanted to watch Cranford... so we compromised.  Next we're gonna watch Cranford.
But I'm not kidding.  I really want to do it.
Our party is also starting now [opens door to break room.]
I, I was gonna say, I think that um, we're gonna help Roy's cousin move.
Yes! I'm in a good mood today! I'm excited to meet all the new people and to see my old friend again, definitely. That's always a thing that makes people happy... to have an old friend back.
Merry Christ--[looks up] NO! Why... why did you bring that here?
My theory is that... [Jim signals he's leaving, waves bye to Pam]
[Clears her throat] The party planning committee, minus Angela, has decided that we're all going to do Dwight's Christmas.
[approaching Michael at elevators] Michael? [to others] He's over here!
This is where I used to keep my computer.
[everyone cheers as Meredith spins and lands on ���tiny wheel���] The tiny wheel actually does have chores. It���s so cute no one seems to mind.
I... listen, umm, we're still good for this weekend, right?
That's a really... well fine,  Do the German instructions say what this is supposed to do?
We don't normally download films illegally.  Because we're honest,  hardworking people.
I spent 10 years as a receptionist, to Michael Scott. And I have kids now. And I just, I can't.
Nope, I don't have a card, but I'll do you one better. A little scrap of paper.
I was in the meeting with Jan and she did say that it could be this branch that gets the axe.
Hey, um, can I ask you a question?
You remember you fired Roy for attacking Jim and I don't talk to him anymore really.
[to camera] What? I'm not in love with her.
There���s this balloon that has been floating in the rafters of the warehouse for, like, ever. And, okay, it���s not -- it doesn���t sound cool. You just have to see it.
It just- [Kevin banging and shaking the snack machine]  To be making a case for passion in Edwardian times, I thought was, uh...
I have never, ever dated, or wanted to do anything resembling dating Michael, ever. Not ever, not now, not then, not now, not ever, ever.
[to Jim] Shush. [to Kevin] Kevin, a playful touch on the arm, or on the back, it can show your interest and it's really romantic.
I use to love coming here.  The chicken parm is good.  Big part of my childhood.  Oh, maybe Michael will start dating that too.
Robert doesn't talk like that. You have to stop Dwight from doing this.
HEY!  COME ON!  Let's listen to Dwight's presentation! [Dwight winks at Pam]
I don't know if I'm gonna make any money with art.
It's actually based on a book called Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.
Let me just say, you've been promising me this chair since the day you hired me.
And we know how he died.  Flying into the glass doors.  But you know what?  I don't think he was being stupid.  I think he just really, really wanted to come inside our building to spread his cheer and lift our spirits with a song.
Ladies and gentlemen, I think we have a winner.
Hey Michael, would you get me some coffee from the warehouse?
I'm done. What are you... Is that supposed to be my mural?
Well... it's just that the weekends aren't good because, um...
Maybe it���s a list of people he���s gonna fire.
No it was really it was really sweet. It was raining and..
Oh, hey Michael! I'm just going to go to Carbondale to price some shredders. I'll see you later.
I think it's interesting how Forster uses Italy to represent sexuality and passion. [Kevin dumping change in the snack machine] And that also brought up themes of, uh, you know, fate and coincidence.  And Lucy's torn between these two things.  She's torn between passion and convention.
I got her.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay...  Jim!  She latched!  She latched.
No, the doctor said every five to seven minutes.
Oh, I'm kind of in the middle of -- yes please.
I just want to say, that this was the best, Dundies, ever! WHOOOOOOOOO!!!
Does this have anything to do with what you were talking to Andy about?
You've already disappointed him so much.  He can't be expecting a lot from you.
[to Jim] Hey. I feel so lucky we're in the same city for Valentine's Day.
Every so often, Jim dies of boredom. I think today it was the expense reports that did him in. And our deal is that, it's up to me to revive him.
That's the weirdest possible solution to the problem.
Roy's my fiance. We've been engaged about three years. We were supposed to get married in September but I think we're gonna get married in the spring.
Hey, good luck. When you get to Philly, will you tell Jim I miss him?
I honestly think you're idealizing people here again, Michael. I don't think that's gonna happen.
Oh, awesome.  You're a life saver.  [drinks from coffee cup] Wait, is this just milk and sugar?
OK, I can tell you're mad at me. Do you wanna just, um, I don't know, tell me why?
Okay. Look at this, look at this. Baby picture.
Hi dad. Yeah Jim has shaving cream, check our bathroom.
Yeah. Um, do you have any other pictures of Astrid?
So this is like, um, an organization station...
If I could get her sleeping normally I could get my life back.
Yeah, well, you know, whatever happens. [Kelly puts her hand on Pam's shoulder] Oh.
I shouldn't tell you this, but... AJ won't commit to Holly. And she's gonna tell him that if he doesn't propose to her by the end of the year, it's over.
Dwight, listen to me. Businesswomen are just normal, nice, reasonable people. Who is a nice, reasonable person in your experience?
That's fizzling. I mean, someone has to start the fizzle.
So... here's the gift. You get to decide what his top secret mission is. [Jim smiles] Sorry I didn't wrap it.
Well, I guess it doesn���t look that cool either. But, it���s been up there a long time, so it���s become a pretty big deal.
No, not like a ham. It's about doing something, so that the person knows that you really care about her.
Okay, okay, we're not going to the hospital.  We are waiting until midnight.
Don't you think the person who left the mess is the obnoxious one?
[in Jim's ear] I wonder what else Dwight's been right about....
Dwight is taking Ryan on a sales call today. So if we find Ryan's body in a heavily-wooded area tomorrow, I owe Jim $30. It's an old bet, but a deal's a deal.
What's going on? Do you know that guy?
Seriously? This is what's so important, putting naked pictures on the desktop?
Okay, here I come. [walks out in her wedding dress]
I went on a date. It wasn't a love connection, um... I think when I like someone again, I'll just kinda know.
We have to come from a position of strength.
I don't think we should eat Packers' cupcakes. We can't give him the satisfaction.
Okay, so, when you���re selling to this woman, just imagine that she���s that nice, reasonable barber.
Really? Oh, my gosh! We just have the one, but she poops for four. [laughs]
Hey, put me down. Put me down. [Meredith turns and looks at Jim and Pam] Oh my god, hey, put me down. Hey...
Wow! You're shaking things up a bit, huh?
Ok, well, sometimes the gift is really about the gesture, you know, like what it means, instead of what it is.
Michael. Okay, I'm... I'm going to talk straight to you because I think you need to hear it. Michael.
Um, well, I could come back as a salesman. I have experience now.
I'm saying we should go scorched earth on that guy's face.
But these were not the kind of people who use their words.
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh, hi Jan. He's, uh, on a sales call. No message? Bye, Jan.
Ladies, are we prepared to let the Kevins of the world decide anything for us? Anything at all? We don't even give him full internet access.
So it turns out Donna and I have a facebook friend of a friend in common, so I was able to see some of her pictures online. [pulls out picture of Donna embracing a man and smiling] This was taken two weeks ago. And this was taken the same night. [pulls out a picture of Donna kissing the same man] This photo was taken this morning. [shows a baby picture] It's Cece. [laughs] She's never gonna do anything wrong.
Has she been on the phone the whole time?
Nellie's pretty fearless. And I think she might be maybe even almost sort of fun.
Hey, hey, guys. Wait. Before we accept these cupcakes, I think we need to have a conversation privately in the conference room. Don't eat the cupcake.
[walking through the office, notices Andy with Erin's computer set up at his desk] What the heck! Why do you have Erin's computer!
There are a lot of one person departments here, so, there's a lot of department heads. But I'm off to a good start. Oh, man! If I could pull this off, it will be scam of all scams. And yet very helpful to everyone.
[on phone] Dunder-Mifflin. This is Pam. [listens] Uh, yeah. [snaps her fingers in the air, getting Jim's attention] Just one second. I will, uh, transfer you to our manager, Michael Scott.
How are you Tom. Nice to see you.
Did you wanna do that now? We can go inside. I'm feeling kind of good tonight.
I don't know if there's really a private place in this office.
Oh. That was like crazy. 'Cause I was...
[watches Jim score in ping-pong against Darryl] Yes! Way to go. [looks at Kelly] See that?
So, umm, is this your first office job then?
Um, I don't know if I really see you two together.
I don't demand justice often. I'm not like Angela, who calls a lawyer every time someone watches a YouTube video of animals doing it. But, someone should get fired over this, right? Val's no help. Andy's gone. Jim's out. I just feel like I'm on my own here. [boom microphone bumps her head, she smiles] I mean, OK, not completely on my own. But, in terms of people who can do something. Thank you, Brian.
What? You have something you want to say?
Uh, just off the top... I think she'll be here this afternoon.
Whoa, Toby.  Watch out.  You're going to violate your own PDA memo.
Maybe this is good. Finding another job is a pain. There's another annoying boss, another desk, I'd have to learn everything all over again. So, there are reasons to stay.
Well, the promo for the documentary aired today.
Maybe it'll be good because then she can like socialize with the other babies.
Here here! Speech, speech, speech, speech [other people start joining in]
I love you, but I'm kinda busy. So I need you to figure this one out on your own.
Hi. [they kiss] Mmm. 'Cause-- [looks toward camera]
And that was fun. But what about a year from now?
After I had my little outburst at the beach, Jim was really nice about it. He just basically said that he missed my friendship too and I would always mean a lot to him and I understand where he's coming from.  For the record, I am not embarassed at all. It needed to be said, and I said it, and it only took me three years to summons the courage, so [quietly, and mock bowing] thank you.
No, I mean he's sulking. That's not like him.
Oh, wow. I forgot how pretty your house is.
Oh my gosh, wait until you. This guy was unbelievable. Ok so-
[getting out of the car] What are we doing at your parent's house?
Alright, I will get a card at the hospital and we'll sign it outside her room.
Nope. Scared of getting cut in half. Also, there's pee on the floor.
I know that Jim has an amazing story about a relative of his who got caught up in the world of drugs.
Is it funny? I thought it was more ...interesting, than funny. [she walks over to see Oscar at the window looking down on man catching a football in parking lot]  I think my water just broke!
Well I know how it is. I know it's a lot of fun. I don't know how it is. Andy, this is a lame job. What are you doing here?
Unless he has a secret costume that he told everyone about except for me.
Oh my God, Meredith what are you doing!?
Well, I'm gonna say something to the producers.
I'm sorry I thought this job was for the position of office manager.
I know that I shouldn't have done it. But I was in the parking lot at the Quick and Easy.
I decided to come. Uh... I feel a little under-dressed... but at least I'm not dressed like a slutty cheerleader, right? Is that mean?
Find someone else, I don���t know. Ask Phyllis.
Not really. It's kinda weird that a grown man is singing from the point of view of a little girl.
About 40 times a year, Michael gets really sick, but has no symptoms. Dwight is always gravely concerned.
There's no one from England, Jim.  Katie studied in Ireland - this is Stacy, the one who does the Murakami-style collages.
Michael, it's time for the suggestion box meeting.
This is the last day of our summer interns. It's been nice. We haven't had interns for a while, ever since Michael's Monica Lewinsky incident. [interns are shown gathered around Kelly's desk, one holding a box of tissues, as Kelly cries and wipes tears] He didn't do anything sexual. [female intern opens a jar of salsa for Michael] He just made far, far too many Monica Lewinsky jokes. [Meredith rubs her breasts into Maurie's back] It was just easier for corporate to shut down the program.
[to Jim] I'm sorry, I'm leaving you alone for lunch.
My personal favorite is the one he made for his condo association.
Dwight, want me to get you some eggnog?
I don't know, I didn't read it carefully, I just saw 'congratulations' and I skimmed the list, I saw my name, I came in here to tell you and get a snack.
Oh... is there another wedding at the hotel this weekend?
Well, other things you can do to help cut down on the spread of disease are to wash your hands regularly. Don't come in if you're sick.
I haven���t told anyone here about the mural yet. I want Jim to be the first to know. Whenever I tell him good news, he���s always like, ���Beesly!��� I love that. Only thing better than getting the job-- ���Beesly!��� [chuckles]
I think... I mean, I don't know what it is but...
Or have them sing that song! That the frog does in Looney Tunes.
This could all go away if you just tell me the truth.
Look, seriously, I can move it fine. Come on, let's go, it's our ball. Let's go!
I don't know what to do! Do I go tell Jo, or - I don't want everyone to keep blaming the wrong person!
[imitating Deangelo's pretend juggling routine] Look.  I'm juggling eggs and bowling balls.  I'm juggling with one hand.  No hands.
And we move to the south of France. See? No, there's plenty of bicycling for you. I think that's where they do the Tour de France.
I just, uh, thought you'd want to know that.
They say if you're nervous around someone you should picture them naked. I do not recommend this strategy. Try picturing them with more clothes on... or a funny coat.
She's just, she's really tentative about latching, and I just, I want to keep her self-esteem up.
Okay, you do not have to do this.
Last week Jim wasn���t there, and they named the company Athlead.
[Michael knocks on Pam's desk] Yeah? [Michael points at Pam, himself, and Meredith, mimes drinking, driving, then points to his watch and holds up five fingers] I weirdly know exactly what you're saying to me.
Hm. I'm looking forward to getting to know you better, Vikram.
Um, there was an amazing buffet and there was a chocolate fondue... station. And what else was there?
You shouldn't be fired. I mean, you were just protecting me.
Okay.  So, I'm just not sure if I'm releasing, though.  I'm not sure if...
If you don't take out his battery, he just keeps going all day.
We decided that there's no way Dwight would harm a child.
So how much antigravity potion do you want?
Yeah���turn signal. It's exciting to be painting again���those are the wipers. So���the���its���just. There you go! Yeah. [chuckles]  Yeah, things get so busy with the kids���red light���that it's nice to have that creative outlet���red light! Red light! Red! Red!
[to Jim] Why don't you talk to him about it?
Oh, Dwight. I'm so sorry. Were you guys close?
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. [excited] This is Pam. I did?
Yeah. Yeah, I mean I could have used another week, or three.
Awesome! I'll leave it up here so everyone can enjoy it.
Okay, Dwight, but if you do need a key, just listen it's under the...
No, no it wasn't Andy. It wasn't. It doesn't matter. It's not about who you've been with. It's about who you end up with. Sometimes the heart doesn't know what it wants until it finds what it wants.
It's just good to stop a Michael train of thought early before it derails and destroys the entire town.
[Singing, Pam mumbling lyrics] Closing time, time for you to go home to the places you will be from.
Okay, I get it. [Michael laughs] Why are you giggling?  Is this a joke?  [Michael continues to laugh] Michael, is this-- did I get the job?
Michael, Michael, wait we don't have, we don't have the budget for another party.
I asked Tom and Pete to come early so we could play a prank on Jim at lunch! Pretty awesome, right? I think they're into the idea. They're probably thinking, 'That Pam Beasly, she's the coolest sister-in-law on the planet. She's the best! The absolute best.'
I know that it took me a little while to come around and its still a little weird to get used to, but you obviously make my mom very happy.  And that makes me happy.
[giggling] Oh, wow. Funny. It's after my grandfather.
Ok. All of these things are important to remember but the most important thing is no one say anything about my pregnancy at the wedding.
You'll be Mr. Christmas by the end of the night.
I know, you don't like to be frazzled.
[to Roy in Jim's earshot] ...back so soon.
No, I���m not upset. I���m really excited for Darryl��� Maybe I���m a little disappointed that we���ll be losing him.
Let's see.  I had an aunt that I was really close to.  She was this amazing female boxer.  Um, anyway, she was injured in a fight, and she was paralyzed.  So, you can imagine how upset I was when I found out that she asked her manager to remove her breathing tube so she could die.
Do you think you could work from this? [showing Tattoo artist sketch pad] we made some small adjustments.
No, no, no, no, no.  Oh, no. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Nooooo!
[voicemail message for Jim] Hey, I have a chance to sneak out of here early, and I'm not messing this up, so I'll see you tomorrow.
Is that what he tells you at your little inner circle meetings?
I have Ben Nugent on the line, he is the top salesman in Utica.
Well count yourself lucky. Wait until you have two. That's two sleep schedules, two naps that don't coincide, I mean, you'll never sleep again.
We need to come up with one realistic thing that we could do today.
No, I don't know what the future holds, but... I'm optimistic.  And, uh, I had fun goofing around with Dwight today.  Jim and I... are just... too similar.  Maybe one day I'll find my own Karen. But--- you--- that is, a, um, you know, not--- A man.  A man version.  But, uh, until then... I can hold my head up. ... I'm not gay.
You did good, Dwight. It���s okay. I mean, seriously, Jan���s not normal. Let���s just go. She���s not going to sell to us.
And spend time with George Emerson.  That's what I would do.  I mean it's the best male protagonist we've read, right?
[surveying an untidy office] The building���s custodian is on vacation for the month and Dwight is too cheap to hire a replacement. So, instead, we���re living in filth. But, not for long. Because I have created the chore wheel.
I haven't heard anything, but I bet Jim got the job.  I mean, why wouldn't he?  He's totally qualified, and smart, everyone loves him... and, if he never comes back again... that's OK.  We're friends.  And I'm sure we'll stay friends.  We just, we never got the timing right.  You know?  I shot him down, and then he did the same to me, and...  But you know what?  It's OK.  I'm totally fine.  Everything is gonna be totally--- [Jim walks in]
Different colored paint. I wanted different colored paint in the spots where they put their paint. So, it just is... OK, the point is, these warehouse guys are vandals. And, they need to be stopped.
And he wants to take the WaveRunners to the lake this Saturday so...
I love my Mom. Okay. That's probably really the most obvious statement ever.
Great. I am killing it over here. [drops mayonnaise on the ground] Jim, I gotta go.
You're gonna give yourself a bonus of $645 instead of getting the entire office something it really needs?
I don't know, I just, I really thought Jim was gonna propose tonight...
Oh, Mema? She's the one in the teal suit. She's the only 80 year old with no smile wrinkles.
That's not a real knot. When you pull on it, it disappears.
Everything is fine.  You don't have to worry.  Try not to think about it.  She's not coming out for a while, okay?
Sorry. What do I want? What do I want... Oh, it's a pencil cup.
[sees it's a drawing of hers, framed] Wow. I didn't know you kept this.
Hey! Our baby was not a mistake. She was a surprise.
I just mean because you know us and you like observed us for ten years and I feel like he's- I just feel like...he's so into his work right now and....I don't know, am I crazy?
Yeah.  Don't fall asleep at your desk.  [Turning towards the vending machine] Oh my God.
OK. [to Darryl] Do you know the plate... never mind. Why would you know that? And why would I be asking that?
[hands over bag] I didn't, it's from corporate.
Guys, I think we should all ease up on Meredith. This has got to be hard for her.
No, that's a great idea. Let's have a code name. How about Mondays? I hate Mondays? Mondays are the worst?
So how do you come up with your cartoons?
Okay. I'd never heard that before. So, thank you.
You know, you're in a meeting, and nobody knows that you've had sex there, except for you and him.
Before we kick off the party, I just want to remind everyone that an office party is just that...
Oh, don't get us wrong, we like picnics.
Nellie, why don���t you  tell Dwight what we were doing earlier today. And Dwight, you show us that you���re listening.
But that's okay. Because it's not about being perfect, it's about trying.  In fact, why don't we go around and confess some of the ways that we've fudged on some of our resolutions?
I ran into this guy from my high school who has just gotten divorced and he hit on me. In the mall. And I didn't tell you because, I don't know, I felt embarrassed. And, I didn't know if you would be mad or worried. But, anyway, I thought you'd want to know.
I traded with Dwight. Just, I figured, you know, you went to a lot of trouble and it means a lot. And also, Roy got me an iPod or was going to get me an iPod, so ..
Come on Andy! I mean you said you wanted a new computer and this is the best I could do!
I'm still not sure why this woman is even here.
No, it's horrible!  Jim, she might get arrested.
You can flirt with someone to get what you want and also be attracted to them. How do you think we got together?
What are you doing? What do you expect me to say to that?
Guess who just got into the Pratt School of Design.
Okay. Um... here it is. Don't put your fingers in there. [shreds paper] Cool huh?
I don't think Jim means to say that you shouldn't touch her.
Oh, no. Um, I, I'm embarrassed. It's stupid.
Oh, I don't know... [Jim laughs, phone rings] Oh my God.  This is Jan's cell.
[gesturing to Michael dancing in his office] He looks happy.
Okay, everybody! After you walk the runway everyone has to vote for who gets the coupon book. And you can't vote for yourself.
And then on the weekends, would you hacky sack back to reality and spend time with your wife and kids?
This is not enough for you and I���m afraid that I���m not enough for you.
It's only for three weeks, you know with my mom and sister at the house it'll be..
I have the lowest sales record of anyone here.
Michael, do you remember, you specifically told me to only bring one sheet of paper? You said it only takes one sheet to make a difference. And I said, 'Are you sure Michael?' And you said 'Pam! Pam! Pam!' And then you sneezed in my tea, and then you said, 'Don't worry, it's just allergies.' Do you remember that?
[in Meredith's van] I have never seen so many parking tickets.
I recently met Sue, the office administrator at Vance Refrigeration. She has this awesome wall full of fun initiatives and morale boosters and stuff. Sue just goes for it, she's awesome.
Okay, Michael. Um, you know I love when you do that voice, but today, I'm so sorry. I need you to tell me that you know you're not Cece's godfather.
Michael has employed Dwight to track you down.
Hey, Deangelo, my mom just sent me this picture of Cece, it is so adorable.
He's uncomfortable because you're acting weird. So you have to stop acting weird.
It's fine.  Erin, you're going to go.  And you're going to make sure Michael tells the truth.
Hey, Isabel, you made it. Oh, my goodness.
Yes. You guys, I have the perfect idea. Ok, it will just take me ten minutes.
[pointing to Jim's bluetooth headset] What's that? Is that a-
Kelly! Um, how are you adjusting to the move?
People treat us like the race on our forehead. And then we guess what race we are.
[sees Ryan on the horse] Oh, boo! Boo! Boo to you! Boo!
I know. It's totally going to change the way I work out.
We can't let him buy our forgiveness with cupcakes. He was awful to us. And, he still is. How much is a cupcake? $2.50? Is that the price of our dignity?
Because if I had spoken my truth sooner about not wanting to move to Philly, then maybe we wouldn't have had this opportunity for couple's therapy.
Dunder Mifflin this is Pam. Uh, I'm sorry, Michael's not here right now can I take a message? Great. I will. Thanks.
On average, how many hours a day do you spend naked in your office? Just ballpark.
Ok, well, we're going to a bar. Hey. You have to come to stuff with me. I'm serious! If you're going to be my boyfriend, you have to do boyfriend things.
[feels a pain in her breast] Ooh. Ah-ah-ah. Ha-ha.
[with five popcorn bags left] Anyone else?  Nooo.
Well, I remember why I dress the way I do at work.  But I'm gonna keep the clothes.  I mean, it'll be cool to just have some after work clothes that aren't pajamas.
You know, I never did it, but for your 30th birthday I really wanted to surprise you with-
I have this kind of big secret about Angela. And I've been really nice to her... and I haven't told anyone. And what the hell?!
Not well. A doctor won't come out to collect a check for $700.00, or $500.00 if we go with the giant check.
Hey, Angela? Did you hear about the Irish-American Cultural Center mural?
Would any of you be saying any of this if the cupcakes were from Supermart?
I mean it's a very competitive field. But I have a professor who says I have a lot of promise, and if I don't try now, I never will. So...
Cool! Here's a little 'way to go' gift from Sabre. [tosses Erin a Frisbee]
Hey Michael!  I have a present for you, but you have to come down and get it.
Hey, Angela. I got good news today too. I won an art contest.
Sometimes when we IM, I send you that little winking face with the lipstick.
Oh, okay, Michael, slow down. Everything's gonna be okay.
It's kind of like that lip thing she did last night, like a half snarl, half smile? I get the sense that she's very ironic.
You know Michael's been talking to her too.
I told you, I have the number that rings here. Do you want that number?
And I took a bong hit from my Bong Water with my pimp.
Sorry. Um, David is in Vermont. Did you speak with him? He sent Dwight instead.
[in conference room with the party planning committee] So Michael said we can do whatever we want cake-wise. What do we want?
I did. And it's just one of those things that's going to keep gnawing at me, like 'gnaw, gnaw, why? Why didn't he? I have no idea why.'
Jim, what if we both lose our jobs?  I'm trying to think of a way that this all ends up fine, and I can't think of one.
[answering the phone] Dunder Mifflin, This is Pam. Oh, I���m sorry. Jim Halpert doesn���t work here anymore.
No. Except for the pendant that you bought me. Which I love.
Wait. Can you back up? What's the story?
[walking in with a tray of six popcorn bags] Popcorn anyone?
No.  I read in the book about nipple confusion.
Right? Thank you! It���s just Philly. Everyone���s acting like it���s New York or Paris or London.
Okay. You know the test booklets that they give out in all the schools. I was thinking that we could put a coupon in the back that people would mail in to us... and as, you know, as I tell it, I don't like it. Unless, of course, you are responding to it.
Wow. Thank you. Um, that must have been hard for you to relive that. Both of you.
But the warehouse coffee tastes SO much better.
I'm kind of in-between boyfriends right now. So I don't need anything sexy. But I do need some new hand towels. I figure I can cut up this robe.
She doesn't want you to return the barrette. She's not interested in you.
[through phone] It's been so long since I've been with adults. I am so excited to see everybody. Creed, Ryan. Oh my God, Stanley! Stanley's going to be there. Yes, oh my God!
Yeah, you don't grab these [gestures to her chest] for balance.
I'm looking forward to 'Take Your Daughter to Work' day. I am not great with kids, but I wanna get better. Because I'm getting married. So, I put out a bunch of extra candy out on my desk so the kids will come talk to me. ...Like the witch in Hanzel and Gretel.
Yeah, no, he asked for you specifically. He's in the conference room.
Although, like, unlikely things happen all the time. My best friend, in High School, she went to Australia, Canberra I think, and she met this guy who lived only two streets away in America.
Yeah, I get to do this like, every week.
Don't act like you understood anything that guy said. [pat's Jim's arm] Good luck, wingman. [salutes]
Oh, you guys.  Just one second.  [picks up phone] Oh my gosh!  Are you serious?  Shipping emergency.  I don't think I can go to lunch.
Yeah, if I could have seen what he just did, I think I would have gotten angry.
Jim's at the dentist this morning. And Steve is an actor friend of ours.
You know what, Michael? For what it's worth... I was wrong, too. I thought she was interested in you.
[answering the phone] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. I'm sorry, he's not in yet. Would you like his voicemail?
Nope. 'Cause we're really nice people but you don't seem to like us.
Creed. I noticed you don't have a resolution on the board. What's yours?
Ok, um, why don't we just finish the game? Michael, it's your shot.
We can watch a movie and play Rock Band.
You were way meaner to me than I was to you.
Hey, Dwight, um, my friend is kinda into these two girls that he works with.
Please? Kelly's trash talking me because Darryl is beating you.
Well, he could still... I'm sorry about that... Oh could I just get you to sign this second page.
I can't. I'm really sorry if you misinterpreted things. It's probably my fault.
[phone rings, Pam answers] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.  Just one moment, I'll transfer you.
Okay. I'm talking to this woman at daycare...
Yay Kevin. Whoo hoo for Kevin! For stinking up the bathroom.
Yes, it is The Island Luau Inventory '07. It's actually a success compared to Disco Audit '05.
It's okay, honey. [Philip cries] It's okay, it's okay.
[pointing to staff members] Blazer. Freckles. Penguin. K.D. Lang. Holly's boyfriend. These mnemonic devices help to make a connection, and then, also to help you memorize names. I have a chainsaw! [holds up chainsaw, makes a wimpy chain saw noise] Cutting down the competition.
Look at her. Even I want some fries with that shake.
I've talked to Meredith, Stanley and Jim about the chairs. I know they're with me on this.
You know what, I think we should get some other input.
Bring her to the party. Yeah, we'll have Santa, and we'll play games with her. It'll be a lot of fun.
So you guys, you know what's an even more useful treat...is cash. So-
Whoa, that's kind of condescending. Would you say something like that to Jim?
Because I just wanted a relaxing evening at home...
[to Cece] Hm. Don't listen to her. She's just jealous 'cause she doesn't get to come home to someone as cute as you.
There is nothing dishonorable about talking about your life.  People like it.
Usually the day we talk about sexual harassment is the day that everyone harasses me as a joke.
No. My goodness. You have a lot going on. With Robert and everything.
[points to Jim's iPod] You have new music?
Okay, alright, thanks...  Okay, do you want to eat?  You want to try eating?  Okay...  Okay, let me...  Just you and me.  Come on.  There we go...  Yeah...  Oh, yeah.  Like that.  There we go.  You got it.
Yeah, I think I made the right choice.
I guess you gotta move to Philly after all.
Uh... no. I just uh had some other stuff I had to do.
Um, hey, Darryl, listen, it's none of my business, but if I couldn't have Cece for Christmas, I'd be really upset too.
Cece, is reverse cycling, which means she sleeps all day and is up all night. Which basically means I'm up all day and I'm up all night. And if it doesn't stop soon, I am going to be up all night.
No, I didn't mention that you cooked your foot.
This isn't about sides. This is about me seeing a blueish gray old man in the mirror and then he vanishes.
Do we know anyone who was in the accident?
[gasps] Yes! Cece wanted to thank everybody for letting her daddy stay home with her all last week and play, so she brought you a little treat.
No.  No, but I'm allowing it.  Just come here.
[into phone] Hello, this is Pam Halpert. I���m calling from Dunder-Mifflin. Yes, your paper provider. And I just called to say... your mama is so fat, when she wears red, people yell, ���Hey, kool-aid.��� Yeah, your mama���s fat. This is Pam Halpert.
Hey, I���m the one who has to sit next to this weirdo when Jim���s away. I���m in a position where I���m rooting for Nate, and that just feels wrong. [sighs] Forget it.  I need to work on my mural. I have some pointy trees that I need to round off.
No, I mean, you're doing great, and Andy put you in charge of the whole party, right?
Well, I mean, it's an iPod. But ..
I think I should hire them all. Do like Lollapalooza.
We stole Dwight's trashcan and she found some of his early attempts at his sign.
I thought we were having a nice time.
Oh, you mapquested it. It's four blocks away.
Yes, I have a date. He's a cartoonist for the local paper, which is really neat, because I like to draw too. I'm kind of nervous. I haven't been on a first date in nine years... probably shouldn't broadcast that.
You need to be more upset about this. She's your mother too now. Your mother is sleeping with Michael Scott.
So, check this out. According to the handbook, you could make more money as a salesman than as a manager. They have all these incentive programs. I ran your numbers from last year.
Yeah, he's, uh, pretty good, huh? [to Roy] Let's get you into a tub.
I had to work late. Jan's making me keep a log of everything Michael does all day.
That's cool. [opens the container and smells the tiramisu] Mm, good stuff. [throws it in the garbage]
Yeah, we should do that for real sometime.
Let's grab some ice cream, go back to the office, and finish what we started. [others nod in agreement]
So one afternoon, while walking home from school, quirky 10th grader Becky Walters finds a wounded Pegasus in the woods.  And she becomes...The Horse Flyer.
I don't think any of them are supposed to shred magazines.
Wow, this place is��� so great. I had no idea ��� on the phone, you made it sound kind of dinky.
Did a good job, Buddy. Now it���s time to come home.
This was tough. I suggested we flip a coin. But Angela said she doesn't like to gamble. Of course by saying that she was gambling that I wouldn't smack her.
You can't fire me, Dwight, just 'cause Michael's not here.
Just let him flirt with her. People meet each other all sorts of ways.
Senator Lipton helped me submit my design for a new mural on a building downtown. Now I���m just waiting to hear from the selection committee. But, you know, let���s be realistic. There are a ton of great artists in Scranton with way more experience. I mean, who are they gonna go with -- some nobody like me or a big name like Tracy Fleeb?
[voicemail message for Jim] I'll transfer you.  Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.  Hold, please.  Dunder Mifflin, this is ... okay, sorry.  Michael was standing at my desk, and I needed to be busy or who knows what would've happened, so thank you.
I may have a few weeks ago faked a call from Jan in order to get out of a synopsis of, I think it was, Navy: NCIS. Since then, Michael's been suspicious.
Michael, you have to put your hands down.
Here's a suggestion computer.  I assume you read binary so why don't you zero one one, one one one one, zero one one zero one one.
I worked until about 2:45 AM. And then I had to decide if I wanted to spend the night with Michael editing in his office, and Dwight watching Michael edit in his office, or drive home and probably fall asleep at the wheel and die in a fiery car wreck. I passed out on my keyboard trying to decide.
Yeah, maybe I'll just move in with my boyfriend 'cause he's kind of a slob, too.
Besides, we have something those other people don't have, which is a home and a bed.
[whispering] No, no, no, you have to do it-
Actually, I put the catalog in your hands 'cause you have to pick out a new chair.
[leans over toward Erin] Um, hit the speakerphone button. The speakerphone button? The same button as you hit before... or sit on it.
What does that even mean? Where would your name appear?
Oh no, don't, don't, don't, don't. [Michael laughs] Aah! [laughs, then leaves] Okay...
Uh, I have to stay here and answer the phone.
The ones for drivers to check their blind spots?
Roy was supposed to pick the band, but he's concentrating more on the bachelor party now.
What? What is it? What? What is, oh, my God! [Jim starts attacking snowmen] Honey? Jim? Jim!
Oh, boy. Maybe your heels are too high.
We got the van at a used car lot.  We think it says 'Alleluia Church of Scranton.' in Korean.  It was either this or an old school bus with an owl living in it.
Yeah, I changed them to your new address.
The two people with the lowest sales in the quarter have to do them.
Does it have to do with these shopping bags filled with hot dogs?
Yes, Jim, I think I know how to point a rectangle at something.
Oh in three months we can. Check the lease, and if you don't undo all the changes you've made, we're moving. Hey guys, can I show you some pictures.
So, uh, biggest thing, besides not being able to get her to latch...
Angela - she used to stay here sometimes?
Okay, it's not regulation size, but it'll do. You have to practice. You have to get real good and beat Darryl.
Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. Uh... hold, please.
Okay, well I didn't think about it like that. It's just, I can't do anything about it. I can't replace that one unless that computer breaks.
We can't help you if you don't just tell us what happened.
Okay, just so you know, it's just the students from my class in a little studio.
Uh oh. Someone started off on the right foot with the new boss!
How are you, Isaac? You have something in your ear.
You can't be a part of our relationship, Michael.
Perfect boobs, [gives a look at the camera] of course I remember Holly.
What do we know about this bird?  You might think, 'Not much.  It's just a bird.'  But we do know some things.  We know it was a local bird.  Maybe it's that same bird that surprised Oscar that one morning with a special present from above.
Oh, yeah, because we were kind of dramatic in the beginning. Well I don���t think anything���s gonna change in our lives now. With work and two kids there���s just-nothing interesting is going to happen for us in a long, long time.
Um, Jim, please, please, please, I think it'd be weird if you did it.
I used to be young and cute and sorta funny and I could do those cute, little cartoons. And everyone who came through here was like, ���Who���s that receptionist? I like her.��� Now I���m just a fat mom. Yeah, and you take one look at me and you���re like, ���Oh, loser.���
I'm supposed to turn the lock when I leave, it's part of my job.
It is totally inappropriate, but on the other hand...
[to Roy as Jim escapes into bathroom] Are you kidding?
Mose, Angela hasn't been around here much lately, has she?
Because I got it at Blockbuster and they don't put the pictures on the box.
[shocked after seeing the torn up carpet] Hey��� What happened here?
One is tall and brunette, and the other one is short, and blonde, and perky, and kinda judgmental.  Who do you think he should choose?
Michael tends to procrastinate a bit whenever he has to do work. Umm, time cards, he has to sign these every Friday. Purchase orders have to be approved at the end of every month. And expense reports, all he has to do is initial these at the end of every quarter. But once a year, it all falls on the same Friday and that's today. I call it the Perfect Storm.
Oh, hey Jim. Some prankster switched the elevator buttons on Dwight.
Jim's been spending a few days a week in Philly and I'm not gonna lie, it's been challenging. Yesterday, things took a turn for the worse. I found out Cece has lice. So I was up all night disinfecting every sheet, towel, toy, item of clothing in the entire house. I'm exhausted. But don't tell Jim. He has a huge meeting today, under a lot of pressure and he's doing it all for the family.
Hey, I was thinking about dinner--- [Jim grabs her face and kisses her]
[laughs] Jim does the best impressions. Sometimes he'll look up at me from his desk and he'll just be someone else. Like he'll go um, [makes mournful face, giggles] that's supposed to be Phyllis.  I can't do it as good as he can.
Why did you put Dwight in charge of that? He did a horrible job.
Oh you have to Jim? You literally have to?
Hey, sorry, I really didn't want to come in. It's just that we have to go buy a new Christmas tree, and we're hoping we could borrow your truck.
I can't believe he's getting a CAT scan.
I'm gonna to miss Toby. He has a nice, calming presence in the office.
But don't you also have girlfriends in Paris?  Like a lot of them?
[on Bluetooth speaker] Hey, New York ain't free. Get back to work.
OK. What does he like? What's important to him? Does he have like a favorite pair of boots or a lunch box or...
[telephone ringing] This is Pam. Oh my God, are you sure? Uh, okay. Okay, um, we���ll be right there. Everybody, the balloon is falling.
It's like mommy and daddy are fighting. Except mommy outranks daddy and mommy is way scarier.
Yeah, do you need a hand? [everyone joins in]
This is Michael, my boss. [she points] Justin.
But then you fall asleep and there's nothing for me to do.
I forgot what a super, nice girl Katy is. And just... good for Jim! They are so cute together. And, um, what an adorable car.
[Ryan and Kelly make out in the nook] But she's had a bad influence. She's like an addict. [Ryan and Kelly argue] And I just had to get her clean.
Um, Karen left her blindfold on the longest but she also threw her egg at Jim.
But, ah, I suppose the second one is the better written line.
A little different. What time is it there?
Jan called and asked where you're going to meet for dinner.  She wants you to call her.
Michael... you shouldn't be with someone who doesn't make you happy.
Then I'm gonna run fast in the middle.
Oh, wow. Seriously? Oh my gosh, is that champagne?
But instead, you found something to distract you from ever picking out a chair.
Yeah, but aren't you supposed to do that to our... no. It's great.
We need another approach. Um, we need to fine the weakest one and separate him from the group. [they notice Nate struggling with a box] Yeah. I think if we could get Nate alone, we could crack him.
We have maybe a month.  I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Yeah, but we don't have a power cord.
I am not going to let Kelly throw her life away on Ryan. And it has nothing to do with access to my pediatrician. Why you would even ask or were going to ask, because I- I felt like that question was coming.
I saw you were getting along with Ryan again.
[walks into a movie theater showing The King's Speech]
[holds up single sheet of paper] Um, that's all we brought.
Whoa! Hey! That is not OK. What are you gonna do about that?
[looking at Cece's diaper] Somebody needs a change.
W.B. Jones is renovating their offices and their construction crews are taking up some of the parking spaces we used to get.
Thank you. I appreciate that you appreciate that.
Yeah, it turns out I was, um, just grasping at straws.
I wonder if she'll start calling you 'Jim'.
Oh right, okay. Hey Stanley, it's great to see you!
Everyone, can I have your attention.  This is the moment you've all been waiting for. Right? [drum roll on copier]
Hey guys, we're all gonna visit Meredith at lunch. And we're kicking in $5 for flowers.
[accent] It wasn't me.  I'm not goin' down for this!
Michael, this is a terrible terrible thing you've done.
Look, I'm not the one who asked you to do a split when you've never done one before.
I know, because you're the reason we're moving.
We have good give and take. [vaudeville delivery] I give, he takes.
I hope you got sound on everything. I'd love a DVD of that. [at computer opens translator. Types in ���Elskere��� which comes back as ���lovers��� Pam smiles]
[hesitating at the bribe] Yeah. You know what , I think I saw ONE sick day down there.
No, I met his wife in Mommy and Me. They're a great couple. You should meet them later.
Dressing up as somebody-I mean, when has that ever worked for you?
Uh, could we come in too? Just for some water.
[puts hand up for high five] Same religion.
[smiles] Go ahead.  I think it's your turn.
They're both single, I have a sense they might-
There's some filing, restocking the supply shelves. Replacing the water jug, which nobody likes to do. Um, we... uh, eat a lot of cake!
You don't look reluctant, Michael. You look really eager.
Sure, but we should get to the bottom of this. Let's pick a rumor and trace it back to the beginning.
Oh, I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
Okay, let���s stop here. Anyone have any thoughts?
[Pam and Meredith singing karaoke] This one's for all you ladies out there.
I know. Yeah, and it was going really great at first. I got video.
That's a very rude thing to say, Kevin.
You can tell Michael that I'm not leaving.
This is our first and only Valentine's Day as fiances.
[to Nellie] Maybe, maybe I could, could get the ball rolling. [Nellie nods] Um, Frank? Hi. Pam. Um, I am so sorry if I've done anything to offend you. I'm sure it isn't easy for you guys to have an upstairs person coming down in your space. So. Truly. If, if, I apologize. But enough about me. Your turn.
Oh my god! I love it! Uh, I���Nellie, this is brilliant!  [sees Jim] Hey!
[at her desk, grabs her plant and sees it dried up, looks at Jim] Oh. You couldn't have watered it?
We need everything back the way it was.
Oh, my God, [eating a bar in the hallway] I thought I was gonna pass out.  [Jim takes it from her and takes a bite]
When did you find time to do all this?
I'm so sorry, Rolando told me everything.  How humiliating.  Would it help you to return to another age?  A time of refinement, and civility.
And we'll make sure Dwight doesn't do anything C-R-A-Z-Y.
Roy's right. There's no guarantee it's going to lead to anything anyway.
And then, remember, we went shopping the next day to buy me a washer and dryer?
I feel horrible for blowing Jim's prank. I don't know if you can tell, but he's mildly upset. And Dwight hasn't been messed with in a while, so he's become a monster. I need to make this right.
Well, that���s funny because I think of him as working part time in Philadelphia.
Here, uh... Meredith? Why don't you put your hazards on.
[looking out the window at Dwight washing the car]  Awww, he did that for me?
Look, I really need this new chair. I mean, seriously, how is it possible that in five years I've had two engagement rings, and only one chair?
Mom, have you decided what you want to be called?
I was just going to go down to the hotel bar for a little bit.
Down.  You have to sit down so I can get the full effect.
Please? Just make sure he's OK? [Jim climbs through hatch]
OK. [Goes out onto terrace] Oh wow, you have a nice view.
[Pam and Jim hear Dwight crying] Ugh, your turn.
Jim doesn't let me wash his NFL jersey during the playoffs. How is this any less logical?
So when do I get to hear everything? Are you still getting unpacked or... you want to grab a coffee or something after work?
Okay, you guys, have fun. You too, Andy.
No, Stacy is a boy.  Ugh.  Frustrating.  Why can't you just be in art class with me?
[on the phone] Hey, hey! Where are you?  Can you take Andy to the hospital?
You know what they say about a car wreck, where it's so awful you can't look away? The Dundies are like a car wreck that you want to look away, but you have to stare at it because your boss is making you.
I needed leverage so I pulled those pictures off the internet. It's just this Office Administrator thing, I don't wanna...
It was supposed to be for Meredith, 'cause she said she likes my drawings.
I think one of her cats did once. She came in with scratches all over her face. [both laugh]
Aw, that's so sweet! [dart fires out of box and lodges in ceiling]
I'm not apologizing to anyone.  Michael owes me an apology.
Well the first one has a surprise factor. 'I'm a suck suck-suckidy Sabre!'
[Michael sits alone eating at the back of the kitchen, Pam comes in with Jim, Creed and Kevin] You should do more stuff like that.
[talks over flashbacks] Kelly has been a handful in the past.
One time we had an ethnic festival in Scranton. One time.
Yeah, I guess. I mean, I kinda liked my old desk mate.
Oh, no everything's great! Um, I was just calling to see how the meeting went.
For the past few months I've been sending Dwight letters from the CIA. [hands a folder to Jim]
Something's up with Jim and Karen.  Not that I've been eavesdropping.  It's not really any of my business, but I've gotten pretty good at reading the back of Jim's neck.
[long pause] And of course, if there's ever anything I can ever do for you...
Yeah, I needed to take care of some stuff.
Michael's got a few tricks for Valentine's Day. He found a place where you can get 12 plastic roses for $10 and he's got a great line. 'Me so thorny.'
You guys, if I knew you wanted to do a caption contest, I would have drawn something more challenging.
I don���t know, but it might take me a long time to figure it out.
Kelly, we're going to visit Meredith at lunch.  [Kelly's lying down on floor, head unseen under desk.  She rolls to her side, away from Pam]  Kelly?
Okay-- just-- don't ever date a member of my family again.
There are a few people I decided not to invite, and that might make things kind of awkward but ...  it's my wedding. And I don't want anyone there who has called me a hussy.
Sometimes when he's not here, I try to throw stuff in it.
[taking paper from Kevin] Oh that's mine! Um, I'll just, I'll get it out of the way for you.
But Andy does, so we have to watch it with him.
It's OK. You know what they say, a change is as good as a rest.
I don't know. I try not to bother him about this kind of stuff.
Alright, let's give her a break. We don't know for sure this is Meredith's fault.
Hey, uh, any volunteers to come with me to go buy a Christmas tree?
Okay. [Jim and Pam hug] Good luck. You're gonna be great.
Hey, Meredith I need to tell you something.
And then you stopped at the bar on the way back?
Here's what I was thinking: everyone sits on a chair every day...
Mm. Excuse me. Could I get some more water?
[on phone to Jim] There���s nothing down here.
You know, I really do think it would be worth it to pull over and just take ten minutes to eat.
If you're using more than three pieces of tape to wrap a present, you're doing it wrong.
She's talking about the handprints that celebrities make in the cement.
Nice. So, should I reschedule the rematch with Darryl now?
Uh, to speak my truth, I'd appreciate if you hung that up cause we were in the middle of a conversation. [Jim hangs up phone] I appreciate the sacrifice.
You know what, Dwight? Let me just check the bathroom first. Okay?
[on the phone] Hey Kelly, my stuff just got here. [Kelly screams with excitement into the phone and Pam has to take it away from her ear]
I don't think those were yours to take.
We just had to add a few more tables. We weren't expecting this many people.
Yes.  And I think they gave him too many fries.
Thank you. Really you guys thank you. Very sweet.
Yes, Michael, new chairs. These chairs are terrible. We were supposed to get new ones last year.
Or you proved that he thinks you're gay.
She's sweet and cute. I thought you'd get along.
It's like squishing a spider under a book.  It's gonna be really gross but I have to look and make sure that it's really dead.  Sooo... [to camera guys] If you guys see anything... ?
[outside, on cell phone] How could you do this to me? He's my boss! How many times have I complained about him to you? No, I am not being dramatic, you are being crazy!
[over loudspeaker, imitating Darth Vader] Luke, this is your father. Come set the table for dinner.
Come down and... open it and you'll see.
I lied it's personal. It's about me and Jim. We're... I just... you're the only person I can talk to.
I know Jan didn't poison the food. I know that. But if she was going to poison the food of someone at that table wouldn't it be me? Michael's former lover?
Phyllis has gotten into audio books and lately she's been listening to 50 Shades of Grey.  Which, if you don't know what it is, it's a book about um...
[Michael comes out with Vikram, arms raised] We got Vikram!
Maybe sort of ahead of his time as a writer.
[to Michael on speakerphone] Ok, you want me to read 'em?
Oh, no. I took a phone call in the middle of taping, and then when I went to turn it back on, I must have turned it off.
Yes... nice!  I can't remember the last time someone made me dinner.
Really? I've been putting the kids to bed by myself every night for a months. And you had to miss one phone call. Is that your truth, Jim? That's really your truth?
Oh, all my stuff is still upstairs so...
That sucked. He didn't apologize. There's no talking to that guy.
[walks in the conference room where Jim and Dwight are playing ping-pong] How's it going?
[hangs up phone] Dwight. Dwight. Can you please tell new building owner that he is screwing over all the people he works with, people he's worked with for years. His friends.
I have decided that I'm going to be more honest. I'm going to tell people what I want. Directly. So, look out world, cause ol' Pammy is getting what she wants. And, don't call me Pammy.
I didn't see you! You should have yelled ���Crossing!���
Dwight, that was really nice. You should ask for her number.
Michael likes me to run the camera when he makes his apology videos. My favorite is the one for his mother.
Prison Mike? What was the food like in prison?
When it comes down to it, it's a health issue.  I should have written that.
[voicemail message for Jim] Hey, what's that word we made up when you have a thing stuck in your shoe?  Anyway, I have a thing stuck in my shoe.
My old art room. [finds a sheet of blank paper] Oh, maybe it's still here! [looks for her painting] No. No they must have taken it down. Never mind.
Well in your fantasy we're Stephen King characters.
Okay. Okay, here. Okay, so the next time he goes to the bathroom, I���ll distract him, you take that.
And Sunday I'm thinking of going to that flea-market at the drive-in.
I know. But we should go. We need to thank him for, you know, saving my life.
Hey.  I'm not going to get in the car, because I know if I do you'll try to drive me to the hospital.
Let's just see how we feel when we get there.
Todd, you're just saying insults in the form of an apology.
New York, as it turns out, is very expensive, and I ran out of money. I thought about selling a kidney, but Michael offered to get me a part-time job at corporate.
You know, maybe we should just have our own pregnancies and not pretend like we���re in this together.
[to Michael] What's the matter, you can't fight your own battles?
All right. I did not come back here just to see you.
Oh I can help starting dinner if you need it.
Is it because of Michael? Did he actually do something?
Alright. Just don't worry, we'll figure this out.
[looking with Kevin at the art show flyer] Should be fun.
Unless someone very close to us is in immediate physical danger, you should not be calling us.
Hide, they���re giving out jobs upstairs. Why don���t you go up and get one?
Ok, that's uh, good news [Pam sees Angela eavesdropping] Uh, yeah, no I'll let you go.
Oh Angela, those brownies have walnuts in them and I think Kevin's allergic to walnuts. You're allergic to walnuts, right Kevin?
You know, I think there could be a lot of benefits if you could learn to get along with women.
Michael's birthday was actually pretty cool. It was a good day. I don't know... It was a good day.
I have the most boring job in the office, so... why wouldn't I have the most boring job on beach day?
I saw it.  I saw it, and it was amazing!  Who said I didn't see it?  Did Jim say that I didn't see it? I saw it!
What? Come on guys. We need to figure out who did this and punish them. This isn't just about me. This is about all of us. This is our mural. Don't you see? How much we worked on this? How much time and energy? We put our heart and soul into this thing.
Except where Juliet doesn't have that great a time and Romeo doesn't call back after two dates.
We were hoping you could do something like this���
Wait, are you saying that into the phone or are you saying that to me.
Oh, thank you! I don't know why I doubted it, because I'm so clearly awesome!
I kind of forced you to do it.
Oh I will. I will Kevin. I will make that my top priority.
Yeah... [they see Erin eating in her car, and ducking when they see her. Pam knocks on her car window] Hey, Erin, everything okay?
Then why isn't he scheming? Or preparing to avenge?
Well, you should cover it with the broccoli.
How far away does she live now, like ten minutes?
I want us to make it. I want a fresh start.
Sure.  There's a transcript between a naval ship and a lighthouse.
And that's what you said about Art School, and that's what you said about sales.
Um, excuse me. I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
So I closed the door but the image of his...
You guys, I don't think any of us are really qualified to be giving Holly personal advice about her love life.
So, maybe just try one at first, and then if it's okay, have a couple more...
Jim and I are pretty sure she had an affair with her ex-assistant Hunter. He was 17. But she looks great. If she asks, will you tell her I said that?
I know you're a very busy man so I'll cut right to the chase. I'd like my old job back.
[To camera] I don't care what they say, I just want to eat. Which I realize is a lot to ask for... at a dinner party.
Yeah.  Maybe you shouldn't fake fire people anymore.
You have any big Valentine's Day plans, Kev?
[Michael is Army crawling around the office] Michael?
Yeah, it was great because it was like you're supposed to be working, but nothing ever gets done.
Oh. That's totally cool. You can do whatever you want.
Maybe we'll use a DJ. That's the one thing Roy's in charge of for this wedding but all he's managed to do is set a date.
Maybe Michael has a point. I mean, if she was really that upset, she wouldn't still be here.
But it's free. And we'll keep our eye on them.
Hey, Oscar, come here. Oscar, this is Matt, and um, Matt loves your pate.
OK, well, why are you laying like that?
I bet Michael had some elaborate theme party planned, like Scrambled Egg Saturday. [a few chuckles]
It's possible that some people thought it was your birthday.
See all this like old stuff, like um, there's that shot of Jim and I up on the roof?
Which just means we get to see more of our lovely street. Tell them what we saw today Jim.
Umm. How many different ways are there to sniffle?
What? No! No, I just had this brilliant idea- everyone loved it. You don't have a copyright on pranks. I might be better at this than you.
Oh, okay. It���s just that���s how Cece does it with the backwards ���E���s.
[on phone] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Just a second. Michael, it's Jan on the phone for you.
[On phone] Oh, OK. No problem. Thanks. Hey guys, WPTU called.  The interview's off. They're opening a new cupcake store at the Steamtown Mall and Iris wants to cover that, so...
[her text tones rings] Dwight stopped the device!
OK Michael, you know what? I might have someone for you.
[to cameraman] What? [looks at Dwight eating a Baby Ruth] Ohhhh... Yes!  Thank you!
Oh, I can't do lunch. I was just sending you an email. Jim and I need to leave early today to meet with our contractor.
Michael, let me make this very easy for you, I could give a sh[beep] about your happiness!  Stop dating my mother!
Well, if it makes you feel better, I didn't get one either.
Hey, Toby. [walks past him to Kelly's cubicle]
Phyllis, if you could switch to a different soap, just for a month or two? Yours is kind of perfumy.
Yup! [Tom and Pete give Halpertian looks to camera]
Tomorrow I start a three-month design program at the Pratt Institute in New York. I will be a little fish in the big apple. [does hand gesture] What up, 212?
My Mom is coming in to visit. And she lives like two hours away. And she doesn't have a cell phone... which is cool cause it's kind of adding some suspense to my day. And I keep looking over at the door hoping she'll walk in.
Yeah, I think the pregnancy really brought us together.
I'm guessing Angela's the one in the neighborhood who gives the trick-or-treaters some toothbrushes. Pennies. Walnuts.
No, I want you to say that you think the 'best' person to be our new manager is a homeless person.
[on phone] So, there was no sales call.
If Dwight's about to get fired, you have to tell him. Just get the words out. That's all you can do.
[laughing] I'm just saying, Roy is very competitive.
You know, maybe there's an opportunity for a joke there, like, um... like, [vaudeville delivery] 'I just delivered a baby. They didn't offer me a guarantee.'
I figured I'd catch you walking to your car, but...
I don't think we really need that, Michael.
Yes. Yes, I desperately want to speak with you about my sex life with Jim.
Here's the story. That guy in there is Jim's childhood friend, Tom.
I-- I thought they were confused at least...
If he comes out, distract him. [takes list to copier]
An impression, then.  Lastly, we can't help but notice that he was by himself when he died, but of course, we all know that doesn't mean he was alone.  Because I'm sure that there were lots of other birds out there who cared for him very much.  He will not be forgotten.
What's going on, why do you have a second job?
Is it a good message or a bad message?
[on the phone] You can fax it over. Yeah, 5-7-0-5-5-5-0-1--
Oh no, I was confused by your phrasing.  You should definitely go out with Jim.  I mean, you're going out with Jim.  I'm not going out with Jim.  You're dating him, which is awesome, because you guys are great together.
[taking Michael's picture] Okay, uh, point at the Dunder Mifflin.
Maybe it's because you spent the whole year flirting with the receptionist.
I need to fit into my wedding dress. However, I'm also pregnant.
Michael, you shouldn't do anything that you're uncomfortable with.
You say one more word; I'm stopping the car.
[as Jim receives and declines a call] Who���s that?
Not one of them called to congratulate me on our engagement.
Unless it's exposed to oxygen. Then it becomes extremely toxic!
I don���t think you guys understand why we���re doing this. It���s-
[Jim bows to Pam; she bows back] Thank you.
Yes, but Reception is a one person department. If I get you a new computer I have to get one for everyone in sales. For Dwight, for Stanley, it would be crazy.
Because some people think you monopolize the conversation by trying to be funny.
Okay, this is just a Christmas card from your paper supplier. No one's putting this on their fridge.
So we shouldn't help you, no matter how much you might beg and plead?
Michael? This is the press release I was telling you about.  Ryan wants you to share it with everyone.
One of the simplest ways to cut down on the spread of germs is to use something called the vampire cough.
Movie Monday started with training videos, but we went through those pretty fast.  Then we watched a medical video.  Since then, it's been half hour installments of various movies, with the exception of an episode of Entourage, which Michael made us watch six times.
No, no, I want my mom and dad to be there.
They came up with that idea really fast.
Because you love her?  [baby voice]  Because you love her very much?
Yes, I invested in WUPHF. It's actually a great idea and I can't believe it didn't exist before. And I know Ryan's kind of a sketchy guy, but hey, I married Jim. I've done my part for the nice guy. Now I want a bedroom set.
OK. I'm gonna be a few minutes. So it's only twenty past five. I still have to do my faxes.
Uh, could I please have your attention? So a year ago, I got my first art commission to paint a mural for Dunder Mifflin and I decided to paint the history of paper���,which was just some trees and stuff. And then someone spray painted a bunch of butts on it and I had to start from the beginning. But it all worked out for the best because I think that I���ve painted the perfect thing which is the history of us. All of us. And this is for you Jim. [applause] And go ahead! [drape drops and everyone cheers]
No, no, it's fine. Just gimme a second.
Yeah, its nuts. But I don't know what else to do.
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. [makes 'talking' gesture with her hand]  Jim, come on, we gotta get in there and practice.  Okay?  I'm not kidding!
No, they have been dating for like two years. [Jim in shock] Since before your barbeque.
[over indistinct conversation] Good? Yeah, he said good, I'm good...
Yeah, and when Michael gets a broken heart, this whole place comes to a halt, so we're just trying to get out in front of this.
[Delivery man enters with a bouquet of red roses. Pam stands up to look at card.] Phyllis.
Um, I don't know, I'm just like, I'm going a little crazy 'cause I keep overhearing all these conversations between Michael and corporate about like, staff issues?
[seeing Jim come in with Cece wearing an old t-shirt] What?
I think you're thinking of The Hunt for Red October.
Well, of course not, but does physical appearance include smell?
[reading from paper] Can you make that straighter? That job looks hard. You should put your mouth on that. How can you even use that one naturally?
Sure. Just one second. Please have a seat.
It's funny you bring that up because yes it is.
Well, ya know, Michael is a great delegator. He never does any work himself. Ever. And one time, I walked in on him naked, and his thing is so small. [quickly walks off stage] If it were an iPod it would be a shuffle! [clapping, laughter]
Because she's not a sex model.  She's a tollbooth operator.
I lied about some aspects of the building.
Oh, okay. Okay, I will. [hangs up phone]
We invited everyone in the office to our wedding.  Even though we realized most people wouldn't be able to make the drive to Niagara Falls.  [whispers] Which is why we're having it in Niagara Falls.  [normal volume] Then Michael told everyone they could have Friday and Monday  off, if they came.  So now, people have to decide if they want to come to our wedding or have to work.
I make that one copy, and I become the girl who makes copies, and by the end of the day I'm receptionist again. And the worst part is, I like making copies. The paper comes out all warm and stuff. And it's cold in there. Cause it's technically a closet.
I still need... you know, my breakthrough, or whatever. [Woman leaves, Roy enters] Hey, babe, how are you?
I'm sorry, we're throwing a party for someone because they're being horrible?
Mom, I'm sorry. I know you and Dad are chipping in for the wedding but I do not want orange invitations. Yes! Well, if you really want my...
I just drove twenty miles round-trip back to the office to get Michael a single sheet of white paper. So, I could have just had them fax it to me, I guess.
Hey. You have a bunch of messages and... [sees Michael shaking head with beads in hair] that's nice. Hannah quit while you were gone. I guess she memo-ed to file some complaints she had about being a working mother? And so you might also have to be deposed.
Why would I love that? Can we afford a delivery guy?
I'm supposed to be Olive Oyl. And it makes more sense when I'm standing next to Popeye, but... Jim doesn't want to put his costume on.
You came up to my desk, and said, this might sound weird, and there's no reason for me to know this, but that mixed berry yogurt you're about to eat has expired.
[on her cell phone] Hey where are you? Yeah, we were supposed to meet here. What? Oh my gosh! That ties in perfectly with something that Michael was telling me earlier! I just don't know what some of the people in, like, accounting are going to do? It said specifically that...
[Jim rushes to open door for her] Thank you.
Really, you can���t be scared of a room full of Jims. I love the guy, but he���s basically Gumby with hair. [Darryl laughs]
Okay, be careful, Kevin. They're kind of spicy.
No. It was a total waste of time. Um... it was fun, though, because I got to spend the day with Andy Bernard. He's really cool.
Do you like it? It's a photo of everyone in the office. So you can take it to Costa Rica.
You know Oscar every time I make this lasagna people ask me if it's a family recipe, but really, I just get the recipe from the box!
Oh my God, you guys, look. It's Recyclops.
No, no, no, no. Undo that. Undo that.
Well, um, you can scan it, and then you can upload the image, and then you can copy the new image.
Hey Meredith, I need your supplier requests today.
So, mom... which birthday are we celebrating this year?
I'm not - I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that.
Thank you. [goes to Michael's office and knocks on the door]
I acknowledge with gratitude that you are being kind and responsible enough to include it in your calendar.
I'll just get a ride home from Angela.
I wish that you'd stop rubbing that lamp in that creepy way.
Some of us like the walk more than others.
Dwight, I don't think he's going to hurt anybody.
You just still have these messages from yesterday.
He's not coming out. He won't pick up the phone.
Ryan invited some of the branch managers and Toby into the woods for a 'get to know you' weekend. Michael wasn't invited. Apparently they already knew everything they needed to know about him.
Great. Uh, except, I don't want to be a receptionist anymore.
The weirdest part is Andy. The aftermath got dumped on him and the way he's been handling it is just..so..
Angela insisted that all the animals be fully clothed.
I���m sure Athlead will be a huge success. But I don���t want him to do it anymore, and I don���t want to give him an ultimatum, but I am not moving our family to Philly.
Hi..  I was just coming out to see what you were doing and to maybe stop you.
What are you talking about? Yes we can.
[with Jim, holding the baby]  She's incredible.  Want to count her fingers and toes again?
Don't tell him I said this, but I always thought he was kinda cute.
Oh, my God. What are we gonna do?
No, because... [Dwight and Michael walk in and march into Michael's office, silencing the conversation]
No, I'm sure they're pretty much the same as the English instructions.
You could have just told us what you were thinking.
Last week, Michael sent out this mysterious memo.
[opens teapot] Oh my god! The yearbook picture!
Twelve drummers drumming. [marching drum band lines up to perform, Andy steps out with cymbals]
No, I got the teacher introducing them and then the applause afterwards. But not so much of the middle part.
No, I���m familiar with spinning. It���s just that wouldn���t work with a chore wheel because people might get the same chore-
I have the worst attitude of any person here.
Good. We watched a video about our changing bodies.
OK, we're leaving for the hospital at 1.
[to Darryl on phone] Hey, you know that guy Frank who works in the warehouse?
Oh, hey, don't fill up on chocolates. I made us a lunch reservation at State Street Grill.
You just... You look good. Your shirt looks... You look real good.
Yeah, he tried to set up my TIVO for me but then I didn't have audio for a week.
We got you this. [gives a bottle of wine]
So, Jordan, uh, where did you work before?  Uh, a law office?
Michael, do not let your imagination run out of control.
[taking Michael's picture] Okay, a little bit more closer to the sign. Yeah.
Right, and if you're interested in the way more fun party, all the info can be found here on our more brightly colored flyer. [Angela rips down brightly colored flyer and walks away. Karen rips down Angela's flyer.]
I don't have any DUI's so I can drive myself, but thanks.
I like fire drills. You know what's the greatest? Like, when you were in school and the teacher would let you have class outside.
Okay great.  [Isabel kisses her cheek] Yeah, I'll see you in a second.  [pauses] Wait, what? [tries to follow, but veil gets caught on wall and tears] Oh! Oh no!
Really. And I don't know about you, but I don't know of a lot of happy marriages that start off with an ultimatum, do you?
Oh, okay.  Well, Michael wants to see everyone in the conference room. [Jim shakes his head. Seems relieved to be getting away from Kelly] But you know what? We have a few minutes so you guys should definitely finish up your conversation. [Jim nods his head as if to say, 'Gee, thanks, Pam.']
Honestly, I think you should go easy on her.
Read article nineteen. There are suitable standards that you have to maintain the building at that includes comfortable temperatures and adequate lighting. It also means no more cutting the tampons in two, and no more tampering with the toilet paper.
[People playing casino games as the actual Casino Night begins] Oh, my God!
Yes. But, what I didn't tell you is that I actually bought the tickets. We only didn't go because it was-
Yeah, I gave him a ride home because...
[shouts] Michael Scott, are you still seeing Donna?
Sometimes Michael gets nostalgic and he talks about the classic gang. That's Michael, me, Jim, Dwight, Angela, Kevin, Oscar, Stanley, Phyllis, Creed, Meredith, Kelly and Ryan. We're a regular Ocean's Eleven.
Hey, well, good morning.  I think I have good news for you today.  I found your new executive assistant.  My friend Carla.  [looking at resume]  She's got great experience.  We even considered making her Cece's godmother, but she had this boyfriend at the time-- but here's her resume.
Okay, which one of these looks more right? [holds up drawing of Stanley with and without a moustache]
Yeah, you didn't need to actually say it.
I find that hard to believe... considering you have problems with every single person in this entire office except Bobblehead Joe.
At least she lived a very long and I'm sure, a very happy life. Got you this card. When you're ready. We all signed it. We just wanted you to know we're thinking about you.
Oh, hey, if you go by the Banshee Pub, tell the Man In Black I say hello.
A little smile and a nod shows that I hear you. Got it?
Cool, are you coming back to say hi?
Cute. [enters office area] Very funny, everyone. Who wrote captions under my doodle? I'm not even kidding. They're pretty good.
Well, I���m heading out to Cece���s dance recital.
Jim, just don't think of it as degrading. Think of it as, you happen to be moving the six inches his way and he happens to be biting it.
I was just wondering, what kind of jobs do you guys have?
Is it? I just, I liked our life in Scranton.
Yeah, yeah, no, no. It���s a good idea to brush your teeth. But you have to um, feed your children. Send them to school. You know, all things you can���t do if you just keep singing ���Monster Mash.���
I can't tell you specifically, but... it's not over.
I can tell Michael's mood by which comedy routine he chooses to do, the more infantile, the more upset he is. And he just skipped the Ace Ventura talking butt thing. He never skips it. This is bad.
Ohh, hey Gabe, I'm sorry, we... we didn't get you a cake or anything. We're gonna miss you.
So���what do you make of this Robert California guy? I mean, what does a guy like that do on an average weeknight?
Yes, you clean all the mugs in the sink.
[over the phone] I just talked to my advisor. Failing.
[laughs] No, I was just checking out my present. [holds up teapot]
So what did you want to show me?
I don't think we registered anywhere. We just want cash.
Dunder Mifflin this is Pam. Oh, hey Mom. No, what did Dad say?
[watching Michael's plane take off. Crying and has smeared make up on] No he wasn't sad. He was full of hope. About Colorado, and he was hoping to get an upgrade as an award's member. And he said he was just real excited to get home and see Holly.
So we just... we wanna help you plan the proposal so that it's safe and responsible and realistic and doable.
[whispering] Angela, are you ready for the wedding?
So Santa, what can we expect from this party?
He said he can't help but tear up when he looks at it. It's like right next to his desk. He must look at it twenty times a day.
Oh, damn. [Pam looks down at her salad] They've been in there for like ten minutes.
So you invested ten thousand dollars to look like a team player?
Of course. He's one of my closest friends.
So we're planning this party for Nellie, and we're gonna make it really bad.
I know, right? What is it? You always look so good in those things.
Yes. It is. And thank you so much for setting up this opportunity, I really appreciate it.
Well, Dwight had this idea, and I thought it was kind of crazy. But maybe that's where we are now.
I'm just gonna go home. My mom's been watching the kids all day.
Why? Does he think you're going to Florida?
No, I mean doing that with Michael. How do you come back from that?
I thought we were just having fun at the beach.
Mo Chuisle. He's watching Million Dollar Baby... He's gonna try to kill me.
[to Jim] Just go in.  Just go in, he probably forgot to text you.
Did I wake up this morning thinking I'd be throwing together a bird funeral?  You never can tell what your day here is  gonna turn into.
So apparently no one dresses up for Halloween here. I wish I had known that before I used greasepaint for my moustache. And I can't even take off my hat, because then I'm Hitler.
Oh... come on, bear man. Come on. [the lights flicker]
[while leafing through Michael's appointment book and seeing nothing but free time] Um, oh boy, let's see, he's really...
We have a meeting with an investor today.
I'm sure no one asked you to do that.
The first lesson of watching World Poker Tour at 2:00 AM, you play the opponent. Not the cards.
Because everything makes me cry, so what���s the difference? This dog, he just wants to protect his bone.
For what it's worth, I liked your party better.
Hey, everybody. Um, I decided to eat my cupcake. I thought about it last night. I talked to Jim. I talked to my sister. And, I think that, as long as Todd Packer doesn't know, it's OK.
That's good. [Michael continues to play conch shell]
So many memories in this old gym. Pretending I have PMS so I didn't have to play volleyball, pretending I have PMS so I didn't have to play basketball. Those were the days!
Oh, okay. Everyone, remember, when he get's like this, he will wallow, if you empathize. Keep conversations light and if you get stuck, and you don't know what to do, make a random sound effect okay? Farting noise, whatever. Okay.
I mean, it's not a big deal, but I think a lot of people from the office will be there.
Planned a wedding with him. He wanted hot dogs.
He took this job in Philly without telling me. He bought our house without telling me. At a certain point, he��shouldn't��be rewarded for that.
Hey, Dwight. Jim and I found your wallet in the parking lot.
Oh, hey, Jim. Wait, stop. Um, I'm sorry... for pushing you towards Cumberland. Seriously, if you left here, I would blow my brains out.
No. We're gonna make it like a prank. Like order bad food, give her this passive-aggressive card.
What's it like without my glasses?  Um, well, here, I'll show you.  Unfocus your lens.  A lot.  I'm 20/400.  You got it?  Okay, I'm gonna spend the rest of the day like this.  I can't see any of the things that would bother me on a normal day.  I can't see anything disgusting, or ugly, or Michael... it's great.
Why do we have to see what Dwight says?
No. I mean, I don't know, I don't think so.
I know.  And how long is CJ gonna spin this whole MS thing?  How can Josh and Sam keep quiet?
Everyone from work is here. We weren't planning on that.
It didn't have anything to do with race.
Oh, great. Oh, I���m sorry. Do you mind telling me her name? I realized we don���t have it.
For the record? Not on board with fake Stanley... although, I get it.
Kelly made me realize something.  She and I have... nothing in common.  And I need more friends.
I feel like I've been kinda cold to Karen and there's no real reason for it. I mean it's not like she's ever done anything to me. So, I think I probably shouldn't be cold to her.
[Pam and Jim are sitting in Jim's car in front of Detroit Coney Island Chili Dogs] This is the best burger I've ever had, babe.
You just said that we're gonna be gone...?
I've really been putting in the hours on this mural. And my boss is totally OK with it, because he's in the Bahamas and has no clue what anybody is doing. I'm usually very self-critical. I hate what I paint. But, I don't know, this time I feel like it's, um, it's really coming together... [sees mural] Oh my god! [camera pans to mural with butts painted over it] Wha? You've gotta be kidding me! What it... are those... are those butts? [to warehouse crew] Huh? No way. No way!
Thank you.  Um, listen I just wanted to confirm that you're not coming to the wedding, which is totally understandable and more than fine.
I'm sorry too.  I just, I think that we both made some bad choices.
He is in my room icing his balls.
Oh, hey, guys! I'd like to introduce you to a new little friend of mine.  His name is New Year's resolution board.
Frank and beans! [both laugh] So what'd we decide for Michael, the bottle of rum, or the seashell alarm clock?
How about, Angela can keep it up on Tuesdays and Thursdays?
Yeah, Jim barely talks to Mike. We had to go through like two levels of friends to even find his profile. Jim picked someone just unattractive enough to shut me up without tipping it.
I feel good. [sees a huge pile of French toast] Wow.
Oh! I... uh... yeah. Um... I'll uh show them to you later.
And he wanted Jim to be a part of it too.
[shakes head] It gets in the breast milk. If I drink it, Cece drinks it six hours later.
Oh I don't care, I didn't really like that place that much anyway. I'll just move.
Sometimes we're so excited we forget where we are. Like at a business meeting.
Oh, thank you. I acknowledge and appreciate that you went out of your way to get me tea.
[Pam sees Mose in an outhouse] Oh my God. What century is this?
Well, maybe we can put the box back together.
Oh, yeah. I'm more than alright. There's just nothing to celebrate.
That's, um... I hadn't thought about it, huh.
[on phone] Hey, uh, give me a call back when you get a chance. Cece did great, and I want to tell you something.
Oh, I love Chuck Close and his photo-realist paintings. But I have to work.
[telephone rings] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Hold please.
We're all in it, from like years and years ago. It's like a home movie.
I don't want to have my baby here.
I was, and then they switched to Acrobat just as I was learning Quark.  I hate computers.
I got back at Frank in the most fitting way possible. With my art. The paints are water-based. It's gonna come off with a hose. But, I think the lesson will last a very...
You put in the garbage can that was a special filing cabinet.
Yeah, I didn't go through with the wedding.  I got cold feet, a few days before.  And I can't really explain it.  I just had to get out of that relationship.  We still had to pay for all the food.  So we froze it.  But I'm, I'm doing well.  I have my own apartment.  I'm taking art classes.  And I have lunch for the next five weeks.
So, Stacy and Eric get to Bogre's DeTech half an hour early so they don't have to sit on the slab.
Did you find anything good in your desk?
Hon, I wish you would have told me an hour ago, when you knew you weren���t gonna make it.
Yeah. He said that you told him how much you love me. About how you feel when I walk in a room, and about how, you've never doubted for a second that I'm the woman you want to spend the rest of your life with. I guess he's never felt that with my mom, even at their best.
That's OK. I don't feel like answering phones.
Do you want me to beat him up for you?
If I get you a slice of pizza, are we even?
Um... I just wanted to say that... Just, my Mom's coming in today.
No��� don���t. Just put it out of your mind.
Yeah, the um, the city commissioned me to do the-
When I get eight hours, compared to like six hours, like, big difference.
[placing a coke can in front of Jim] Here. [Jim looks confused] Just buy it from me. I haven't talked to you in hours and it's been weird and I really want to know what the hell's going on with Dwight. [Pam scoots the coke can towards Jim.  Jim pulls out his wallet and hands Pam a dollar.  He gives the coke back to Pam]
How come out of everyone in the office, I'm the only one that went with you? Is it because I'm that stupid? I mean, your own grandmother doesn't even believe in you!
Will you just, will you grab Clark real quick?
Um... but hey? Something kind of cool. There's this internship in graphic design that Jan was telling us about. She made it sound, like, really great.
Maybe she's just pushing her breasts together to make them look bigger.
I've been working forever on Jim's present. He always gives me the best Christmas gifts. He'll take a memory or a private joke, and he'll create something totally unique. I love them. So this year I made him something. A comic book. It stars Jimmy Halpert, a mild-mannered paper Salesman who, while riding his bike through the forest, is bitten by a radioactive bear, becomes 'bear man'. Wreaks havoc on the office. It's really good.
No.  I don't think I can hit you in the office.
Remember, you were gonna get a new chair, and you were gonna give your old chair to me. Remember that?
Hmm... yeah.  Listen Michael.  Have you really thought this through?  'Cause it's a pretty big risk.
Okay, I told her you'd talk to her.
After you talked, he called my mom and said he was gonna look for an apartment.
Yeah, but in a jokey way where you're gonna start singing.
Oh, my gosh! People keep blowing it out of proportion! It's not even a history.
Look at the huge offices Jim, check out that conference room.
Okay, first, work out. And, hey! Look! You did that. Check. [Michael doing leg lifts] Eat an enormous breakfast. Check.
[laughs] No. The Odd Life of Timothy Green.
[sits down] Oh my gosh, I have been chasing people down all day.  It's incredible.
[telephone ringing] Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. Um, hold, please. [to Jim] There's a Brenda on the phone for you. [to Brenda] Just one second, I'll transfer.
Michael likes me to run the camera when he makes his apology videos.  He says he needs a woman's touch.
No, we settled in a much more rational place, remember?
Michael, you need to get out of this.
You can't, I locked the office from the inside when we left.
Jan used to be one of my superiors, and she is one of the most erratic and terrifying people I have ever met.
Whatever, you know, sleep with my mom, sleep with everybody's mom...
[an Asian lady tries to enter the van] Oh, oh, excuse me!  Sorry. Sorry, no.  It's, uh, it's a paper company now.  It's not for the church.
That is right. Don't make any more of it.
Yeah, whatever. [Jim holds up the card] [Pam laughs] Give it to me. Give it to me.
I gotcha one. [Pam hands over a grape soda to Jim]
I meant to say something earlier. I just...
Well a giant check costs about $200.00 to make up. I have a print shop standing by but... What do you think Michael, that's over 25% of our funds?
I'm sorry, Michael. I need you to say it. I'm so sorry.
You're gonna throw my things on the ground?
It���s going to be good to have someone hot at Pam���s desk huh?
We did, but mostly because people expect us to. We're also accepting other gifts not on the registry... However much.
Jim is really talented. And he should be the one who's getting a better job offer. Like, for real.
No. It's a jokey saying. Pobody's nerfect, like I can't even say those words right. Ha.
[trying to sleep as the baby cries]  Jim, Jim, get her.
Wouldn't we get fired for smashing all the computers?
[imitating Cookie Monster] 'Hey, Erin, You look delicious. I mean, beautiful.'
Yes. In my top three, so suck it.
If you propose to me during a Michael meeting, I will say no.
No... [Jim leans in for another kiss] Jim---
That's not bad. Hey, do you do weddings?
Oh... God.  Oh my God, he's gonna jump.
You want me to write down people's indefinable qualities?
[stopping her] Okay, don't turn this into some feminist issue.
Roy, I picked those flowers. Phyllis just stole all of my ideas for our wedding.
Don't you think it's better to tell him the truth now? You know, rather than waste more of his time?
I literally cannot wait to see what Dwight has planned.  And I wish Jim were here.
Yeah, um, there's good things about Michael. He uh, uh... Yeah, definitely. Um...
Hey. [walks up to Oscar and hands him a report to sign]
Or I could come back as your personal assistant. You know? Sort your mail, set your appointments. I know all the people.
So, what do you say we get started?
[at school in NYC] Can't believe this. [pulls out cell phone... sighs]
I feel bad about what I wrote on the bathroom wall.
Jim is great. Being with him just takes away all the stress of planning my wedding.
[talking head with Jim] It's clear why we were trying not to tell people. That's clear now. [Jim nods, looking at floor]
Hey, why don't you just go up to your office, get some work done, and I'll just bring you a pretzel.
[sees Erin holding Cece] Oh, my God! Go, go!
Angela made several 911 calls about cars going too fast in front of the building, so the police put up a radar gun. It's actually caused a bit of a traffic hazard.
He looks a lot like you. How much time did you spend on that?
Sure. I mean, it's Philly. I can kill four hours. So uh, yeah. I'll see you at eight.
[whispering] Hey, Jim, can I talk to you for a second?
Parenting? Yeah. This is Cici���s favorite magazine. She loves the pictures of babies.
They said they were done with the investing and then you volunteered ten thousand dollars?
If I knew I had a week to live, I would... probably go to Europe. And South America. And the Grand Canyon. And... I would want to see the Pacific Ocean. ...It would be a pretty busy week.
Can you believe my boss proposed to his girlfriend in public? That is so Michael.
Dwight just listen!  It's underneath...  [Dwight hangs up as the policeman hands him a ticket]
The phone has been ringing off the hook. The guys in Philly are kind of going nuts.
I thought it was weird when you picked us to make a documentary. But all in all���I think an ordinary paper company like Dunder Mifflin was a great subject for a documentary. There���s a lot of beauty in ordinary things. Isn���t that kind of the point?
Dwight mercy killed Angela's cat.  It's very complicated.  It's caused a lot of unpleasantness between Dwight and Angela.  Who are both already prone to unpleasantness.
No, I didn't mind helping Jim with his problem. That's what friends do. I help Phyllis all the time. Just yesterday, I untangled a piece of tape from her hair. So, yeah.
You think your doctor's going to give you a C-section at six months?
[voicemail message for Jim] Hey, guess what?  I moved my computer so I can't see Michael's head.  It's working.  I think I can have a career as a very specific type of decorator.
Well, we won���t be late. I love you, mom. Thanks.
Oh my God, I win!  Ok, it was a minor league hockey game. He brought his brother, and when I went to the bathroom, the game ended and they forgot about me.
Because they have a great design program, and I wanted to see if I was any good at it. And I wanted to work on my art, too.
Maybe I played a little in junior high... and in high school... maybe a little in college... and went to volleyball camp most summers.
You told me to buzz you about the suggestion box meeting when Jan was here.
I can't tell if she's getting anything.  It just doesn't really feel right.
Plants and- hi, Robert! Hey, um, how are you doing? Good to see you again.
Just let us open up the presents, Dwight.
[to Michael] You're gonna wanna look at the date on that.  Oh, wow. Look at... golfing. [to Donna] Are you a golfer?
Yeah, yeah. Like when he presses 'Doors closed' the doors open. Or he presses 'lobby' it goes to third floor, stuff like that. Can you do that?
Um, do we have to sleep in your parent's bedroom?
Yes, let's go. [looks at Erin and nods]
So. I've been thinking, after we win the lottery, we take our winnings....
You know, I bet Ryan thinks to himself 'I wish I were a volunteer sheriff on the weekends'.
My fiance has plans for us this Saturday.  So I really hope that Dwight doesn't make me work. Maybe I should sleep with him? I'm kidding, kidding. Totally kidding.
Oh, yeah! We have such a solid foundation, you know.
So, detour. We're now adding Nashua to the Lecture Circuit so Michael can confront Holly and get some closure. Nashua actually sounded very excited on the phone. I don't think they get a lot of visitors. Because their office is only accessible by cross-country skis. Hey-oh! [laughs] [whispers] I've been driving too long.
[on phone with Jim] He said, 'I did like Dwight'? He's gonna fire him.
I just feel kind of tired, you know.
And you kind of torpedo every romantic relationship you're in.
Well, this building isn't far, and its much newer. There's a dry cleaner, nail place and a gym. Oh, and it's next-door to and Outback so it always smells like steak.
See, we knew it! If he just met her, he'd understand.
[Ryan and Dwight enter] Hey, Ryan, are you ok?
Um... Actually, we don't have any staff birthdays coming up.
It's the world's tiniest Bluetooth. I found it in a Japanese gadget store in the village. I got one for Jim, too. Jim, say something.
You have to get rid of all your weapons. All of them. Including killer fish.
Get the keys out of my purse, start the car. [Jim and Pam slowly back out of the office, Pam has her weapon trained on everyone and then they run out]
But I've learned to love again. [puts her arm on Jim's shoulder] He's a cartoon sailor.
And Michael, you don't have rabies. And chances are you're not going to get it anytime soon. So... you don't really have to think about it too much.
Why did you put it off until Halloween?
[clink of beer bottles] Beers? You closed it?
Jim, what are you doing?  Get in there.  This is not the time to take a stand.  At least he likes one of us.
What could he possibly stand to gain from a real juggling routine?  How can you keep defending him?
Oh, great. I forgot mine and I'm wearing a two piece.
And Jim can jump back in without skipping a beat. We���ll come back to visit. But I think it���s time for us to officially���
Forget everything we taught you.  Hey, Jan! It���s so great to see you.
Oh, and then this was Phyllis���s idea���[shocked cheers] So nasty Phyllis!
I just keep getting bored. And I let things build up and build up and then I - I, I do something too big, like this. Who does this?
In Phoenix. They should really tell you that more specifically. I mean, every game is an away game for one of the teams. [long pause] Do we know everything about each other?
Yes, he bowled 5 frames with this pink sparkly thing until a little girl had to ask for her ball back.
Not even. I'm doing laundry for the first time in like a month.
Dwight!  Go to my house.  Get my iPod.  I think it's on the kitchen table.  Do not touch anything else.  The key is under...
Well, that didn't have anything to do with you.
Well, since we're stopped at a light, uhhh, here is...the mural I did for Angela's baby.
[looks up] Why aren't you as mad or interested in this as me?
That was weird, huh? It's all part of the presentation. It was confusing, right? Because confusing situations happen to us all the time in our jobs. [pauses] I'm just trying to bridge the gap between what just happened and the fact that I'm going to be doing the rest of the presentation.  [reading from the cards, in Forrest Gump voice] Sales is like a box a chocolates, you never know which vendor you're gonna get. Forrest Gump.
Michael we don't know what you're talking about...
Wow. He is officially the worst human being.
We came to an agreement. We're going to live in a stunning pre-war brownstone at the top of a mountain.
So, does anyone wanna know where I've been for the last 2 hours?
Okay, it's just three or four steps but thank you, thank you.
Dunder Miff...Michael Scott Paper Company, this is Pam. Oh, hi Russell from the pancake luncheon, how are you? Well we'd like to do business with you too! How can we make that happen?
Oh, I just get those at any party supply place.
Oscar, Kevin, this is my sister, Penny. She's also my maid of honor.
You know what? I-- I-- I don���t think you want to start a conversation with me about what���s fair. Okay? This is way more intense than I ever --
[to Jim] Go up and check on him. He's upset.
No, you should have her mom do the boring Christmas stuff on her time. You should be associated with the fun parts of Christmas.
I'm here. I'm a part of this now.
[singing] Just smile for me and let the day begin.  You are the sunshine that lights my heart within... on the wings of love ...
No, they had to come back for me.
Oh, wait, I gotta go, class starting. [hangs up]
The thing about Jim, is when he's excited about something, like the Office Olympics, he gets really into it and he does a really great job. But the problem with Jim is that he works here, so that hardly ever happens.
I don't know, I kind of hate all our regular places right now. Oh, you know what [Jim gets down on one knee], that one...
Anyway, we also have a special on envelopes.
Oh my God, Ryan! That's perfect! You have to go!
Yes, I said you definitely should go, but you wanted to visit me instead.
[Jim hits a ceiling panel] I don't think he's in the ceiling, babe.
Okay, so here's what I'm thinking. I'm gonna say that before ceramics class, I took off my ring, and then when I changed back out of my smock, it wasn't in my pocket anymore, and I lost it.
You had a nice meal with your girlfriend in a lovely place...
And get your flu shot. Also, I'm going to set up hand sanitizing stations around the office.
Jim. Can I see you for a second?
You're- You know your assistant told me that you have a big pitch meeting today. With Ryan Howard. How did that happen?
Michael doesn't know how to work his BlackBerry.  So when he says BlackBerry me a message, he means write it on a Post-it note and stick it to his BlackBerry.
Dwight, no gun, okay? Don't make us call Jo.
[talking head with Jim] We haven't told anyone I'm pregnant.
Oh, cause it was upside down. [both laugh]
All right. You can go. Give him his gum.
Remember yesterday when we were terrified of being parents?
[sees Ryan coming through door] Hey Ryan. Welcome back --
Yes.  She was a little fussy earlier, but she's totally quieted down.  Here, let me just, uh, let me just burp her.  I don't want her to spit up on you.  Come here, sweety...  Oh, my God!  Wrong baby!
Yeah, right.  God, I need a boyfriend.  You know Ryan I'm totally ready to be set up with one of your business school friends.  Whenever.
I think we broke his brain. [they both snicker]
Oh, actually I don't know what I did with the one sheet. Y'know, that's the problem. You only have one sheet.
Okay, heart-shaped jewelry is not something that a woman buys for herself. A man definitely bought it for her recently, and it wasn't Michael.
Mm-hmm.  Yes, I'm fine.  Um, yeah, the doctor said it's still considered a minor contraction as long as I can talk through it.
I'm gonna do it. And I fully expect to burn my feet and go to the hospital. That's the right spirit when doing a coal walk, right?
Wait, that's it? That's the question you're going to ask him?
We wanted to stay on the phone all day, but the company has a policy against eight-hour personal calls. So we're not telling anyone.
[looks over at Oscar, who is quietly watching this happen] I hope... you have a very beautiful wedding, Angela.
Roy and I are saving for the wedding, so I made him promise not to get me anything too big.
No, wait, come on.  I didn't miss a day, I came in early, I stayed late, and I doubled my sales last month.
So Jim and I are getting married and the wedding's really expensive.  So I tried to get a job on the weekends to earn extra money.  I applied to Old Navy, Target and Wal-mart.  None of 'em called me back.  Not even for an interview.
That's weird. I mean, that's weird to have sex in the office. That's where you work, right?
I'm saving that 'cause I like it when the cards go T-ts-ts-tch-tch-tch.
Not anymore.  It's, um... It's completely over now.
Bottle of rum it is. [takes package out of bag] Alright, shall we?
I finished my laundry.  Got all my socks.  Nothing like that time that crazy guy pushed you.
I thought it might be fun to set her up with someone. Any ideas?
I can't believe this. I mean I have never even stolen as much as a paperclip and you're firing me.
Um, no, I was just, um, just having a cup of coffee, kind of warming up for the day.
You don't have to wait that long. I mean, you don't have to wait a month to ask her out. Just ask her out.
The unfair thing about working in sales is that your salary is almost all commission. So, you suck at sales, you make almost no money. I guess that's fair.
Yeah. I'm in charge of this whole area.
Just terrible.  And the longer you put it off, the worse it's going to get.
Oh, yeah, in my fancy new apartment. I have one bedroom, one bathroom, and a closet.
Next on the list - open the mail.
Just because two people are hanging out, it doesn't mean that they're together,  you know?  Like people can just be friends.  And I think that it was really unfair to think that there was anything else going on.
Let's see. Andy has been manager for a hundred and five days. Which means I've heard 'Closing Time' a hundred and five times. [nods and shakes head] Still don't know the words. Tah wa Ta way hm hm home and home and home.
Don���t you guys have everything. I mean, its just a paper company.
Okay. Put everything back exactly how you found it.
Then who do you think will get the job?
How could I have thought that? How could I have thought that?
Well, I mean, How do you pay back someone for something like that? But, uh, I don���t know. I���m working on something.
My job?  My job is to get married in the morning.  That's my job.
[goes to punch Michael; he flinches] You have to keep your hands down, Michael.
Do you want some aspirin, because you seem a little fussy.
A dozen different pies? Cause that means rhubarb.
[faxing, Erin watching over her shoulder] What are you doing?
Oh, I know.  We talked about it and he told me.
I kind of thought something would happen tonight too.
I should just go.  [accent]  Where to now Caleb?
Yeah, I mean, if it's all the same for you.
Just one. 'This weather makes me want to stay at home, curled up with a good book.'
Yes! They're the only two gay guys I know. But they should be together.
Yeah. No, no, I'll um-- the hundred. I'll just take the hundred.
If you would have asked me that, then you would know.
[laughs] I don't know. I think Michael has a date.
Okay, that's a lot of good ideas. Thanks
Right... you're a sports writer in Philadelphia? Nice build too.
[looks at beers] Oh. [Starts to walk away, turns around] No. Actually, one of these is supposed to be a lite.
Michael, 5k means 5 kilometers, not 5 thousand miles. [knocks]
Michael started the process of selecting a new chair about three weeks ago. And normally I wouldn't care, but he promised me his old one. It's way better. It's one of these. [makes a shrrhhh sound of a chair moving downward as Pam slumps down] I really want it.
I think it's gonna put a damper on the party a little.
Do you want me to ask the cleaning crew if they stopped watering it?
Somebody did something bad to Michael's carpet. Maybe that's all we need to know.
Weird to see how we used to look in those promos. Some of us have changed so much.
He didn't leave me. He just went part time. [Meredith scratches her head vigorously] Can you just fill out the form please?
The thing I like most about Recyclops is that he's creating a different world for our child.
Mmm! Good pate, right? [Matt nods yes] Oscar made it. Have you met Oscar?
Really unlikely. But I can't say that it's impossible.
Like, he used to make dogs fight? Or he actually fought dogs?
Ryan, you should be more sensitive. It's obvious she likes you and comments like that, they just...
We wrote a good review.  Under comments, we wrote, the natural aroma of the beets drifts into the bedroom and makes you dream of simpler times.
Yeah, yeah, but I uh... I switched stuff around because I actually needed like more room for organization. So...
Okay, I'm not going.  I'm not...  It's fine.   [Jim, Michael and Kevin try to help her up] Okay, come on, come on.  No!  I am not going!  I am not going, okay!?  I'm not going today because I can't do it, I don't think I can do it.
[to Ryan] I'll take those. Thanks. [throws jeans under her desk]
The goal of this meeting is to get everybody excited about their resolutions! Who's been good about their resolutions so far? Erin. Tell us about it.
Wow. Your voice is as lovely as ever.
[throws resolution board away in dumpster] Lesson learned.
Oh, my God.  I didn't even have to do the 'C thing.'
You know what? I'm sick of this! Let's go, you and me!
Do you think that you could send in your RSVP card?
Toby, was this your fun little way of congratulating us?
Why would you want to raise your cholesterol?
Just a subway stop away are the best museums in the world.
Just like no big reason. Just a bunch of little reasons.
Okay, well, I just sorta meant, like, cute, right?
[serves] Hyuh! [other team misses and Scranton cheers] Well, look at that, we win!
It is extremely stressful, planning a wedding by yourself. It's like a job. I mean, it's fun, but it kind of becomes like work. I've already planned it all out in my head. But it's just in my head.
Maybe. But it sounds like you're just wrong for each other.
Oh, okay, uh, sorry, guys.  Just, um, keep talking.
He's not saying what he needs to say.
Is Jim gonna propose tonight? He is, isn't he? No, he's not... Is he?
[voicemail message for Jim]  Sudoku. Level moderate. 18 minutes. Suck on that, Halpert.
Yes! Oh! [runs into his arms, kisses him] Um, congratulations to you, sir. [they shake hands business-like]
You need to get something for your girlfriend.
Good. Doesn't sound pushy...you're just stating a fact.
And when they were both in the third grade, Jim was placed in the top reading group.
Kevin, you and Stacy set a date yet?
Well, I feel like she needs to eat, but she won't latch on, which is weird, because the other baby di...
Yeah, I've seen that with my kids. Um, it is tiny, but I've actually been commissioned by the City of Scranton to paint a mural-
Okay. This one is the same price but it's got...
No, no. 'Cause the ice melts and then it's like second drink! [laughs]
I can't believe Angela. I went against my better judgment, and I gave her a Save The Date. And now it turns out she complained about me to Toby.
It's weird. Jan use to treat Michael like he was a ten year old, but lately it's like he's five.
Michael has so many pictures of his kids he had to get two phones with two numbers and he pays two bills.
No no, you can go home. I'm good.
I don't know how I fit in with these women. Here. Or with Jan. Um... I mean we get along great. Fine. Um... I guess the person I have the most in common with is...
Just listen. Remember that casino night about a month before we were supposed to get married? I kissed Jim.
You're right, you're right. I'm a middle class broad. [Jim does his 'Jim face']
Well, I'm not an artist, and I'm not a salesman. So what would you call it?
That's a sad story. I have another one. We move, the other tenants follow, the bank takes the building, takes your farm, takes your car and beats the crap out of you. Penniless, you die, and my daughter Cece dances on your grave... fully clothed. [lights turn off, Pam and Dwight begin to wave their arms to alert the sensor]
I'm sure it's fine. it's a blue shirt.
Seriously? Because it sounds like one of those is better than the other.
[Hunter's voice starts singing, Pam joins in] One night...
Shut up, Hide! ��I mean, do you think Kevin cares what people think about him-- or Creed or Meredith? Oh my gosh, these are my role models now. You know what? I���m okay with that.
[hesitates] I am. I am the office administrator!
What no, wait! You said you were gonna help us!
Oh, yeah, no. Don't worry about it. I mean, he was being ridiculous.
Let me make something clear. Jim and I have never and will never have sex in the office.
No, uh, me Stanley and Phyllis so far.
Got it. I will put out a A.P.B. Otherwise known as a 'Ask Pam Beasley'. ... Did the phone cut off?
Okay, Phyllis sits across from him every day. Phyllis, does he have a moustache or not?
Oh God no, Dwight isn't my friend... Oh my God!  Dwight's kind of my friend!
My dad spent the night at our place last night.  My parents have been fighting for weeks and... it kinda sucks.  Jim's been great. But I'm gonna need to buy my dad a robe.
I'm kidding around.  We joke about that stuff all the time.  I'm not really the jealous type, so, I don't care if Jim sees Karen.  I care a little.
No, no, no, no talking. Jim is not allowed to talk until after he buys me a coke.  Those are the rules of jinx, and they are unflinchingly rigid.  [Jim puts money in drink machine, selection is sold out]
Oh, yeah, we were. We were just looking to say hi. So hey.
I can't do this. I had a real job. I sat ten feet away from my fiance. I had health benefits. I was just feeling impulsive. I should have gotten a tiny tattoo on my ankle.
Not almost, though, Holly. I mean, not -- not close to 200...
[to Michael who is looking at a chair catalog] Did you pick a new chair? It's been awhile.
Oh- [both look at each other and together say] Thank you.
I think we should get a townhouse in SoHo...
Brake lights. Break lights! Break lights! Break lights!!!
Ok. [intense moment where Jim leaves and Pam seems conflicted.  She notices his umbrella and runs out to follow him]
Nobody's going to prison, okay? Um... all right, Michael, you need to convince Jo to go easy on us. And then we'll all confess once we know our jobs are safe.
I���ve been through several rounds of development with the team and here���s where we stand with the chore wheel. [introducing a third ���chore wheel���, excited] We���ve got prizes! Ten bucks, candy bar, manager for an hour but, there are also penalties. Like, no internet, Stanley gets your lunch. The one thing that is not on the chore wheel is chores. But they were right; it���s more fun this way.
You know, Jim���s kind of nervous about it, but I think it could really help.
Uh, not on a three month boat trip.
Kevin, um, let's think of something to distract us. Uh, like the movie Skyfall. You loved the movie Skyfall, right?
Amok. It means, don't let your imagination run out of control.
Good. I thought you were going out for a drink with...
Maybe, but it's not good enough for me yet.
Katy and Jim met in the office. And now I guess they're like going out, or dating, or something. And, uh... I don't know! You know? They're just... She calls him, and they... You know, I'm sorry. I feel like I'm talking really loud. Am I talking really loud?
Does that mean an idea that blows up in our faces later? [Pam's phone rings]
We're the party planning committee, and we did not get where we are by playing it safe. We got here by being risk takers. And, yeah, Dwight's party is gonna be terrible. Maybe. Maybe it's not. Maybe it's going to be great. And if it's great...I think we all know what that would mean to us.
Michael screened a work in progress for us, years ago, and it didn't go well. We thought it was a comedy. [flashback clip of Michael angrily leaving the conference room while the whole office is laughing at the tv] Everything pointed to it being a comedy.
Have you heard anything about any secret office romances?
We were wondering if you would like to have dinner with us tonight, in our home, and play with our baby.
Okay. Well, if you think of it, I'll be here.
Well, you shouldn���t be nervous about this. This is a tiny start-up with a bunch of guys just as dorky as Jim.
Actually, the distractions are good.  I mean, I don't think I'm going to make it until midnight if I'm just sitting here thinking about it.
You know, I changed a tire today. All by myself. This bathrobe's already coming in handy. [Meredith honking] Coming!
And, poof! He disappears. [Jim snaps, playing along]
Michael, do not let your imagination run amok.
Yeah, I get all the memos. [starts to leave]
Oscar thinks that having a dog is just like having a baby.
Please hug and kiss me, no matter how hard I struggle.  I'm too shy to tell you that I love you.'
Race had nothing to do with it. I just knew they'd be good together.
It might seem crazy, but since there's no one left in New York, Michael is Dunder Mifflin's highest ranking employee. So, that's where we are.
What possible explanation could you have for possibly being here? I don't... you know, babies shouldn't have ice cream, by the way.
Yeah. I mean, listen if we���re gonna do this thing, we should do it right.
Oh, bodes well for the post-conference room meeting.
It���s getting tougher. I just didn���t know that it was gonna be this hard.
We should have hired a professional to take our mental pictures.
Seems like a basic reward system where you give us points, and then we redeem those points for prizes.
Michael, I... [sits down] I hate to say this, but... you know this special bond that you've always felt with Ryan, where, like, you're best friends or you're his mentor or something?
No, really, it's okay. I know that Jim had, like a crush on me when he first started. But that was a long time ago, so.
My veil tore.  I knew when we were getting married and I'm five months pregnant that I'm not going to be able to wear the dress that I always wanted or high heels--
[Pam nods head] You should say hi. Use her full name.
No. He just keeps letting all the calls go to voicemail.
Hey!  Jim! Um, listen, can I call you back in a little bit?  I made friends!
No, just do one. Two question marks is kind of aggressive. You know it's like wha-what?? Just do one.
Oh. [laughing] I really thought I didn't get it.
Michael, is, um, sick and he wants one of us to rescue him.
Post-it Notes? What are those worth, 50 cents?
Why don't you wanna eat lunch with your boyfriend?
Jan called. She's coming in later to talk to you.
Please stop saying what.  Can you take him?
[loudspeaker] Jim Halpert? Price check on fabric softener, the kind that gives you...
There are a few ways to get promoted. One is to wait for an opening and apply for it. That's the main way. But this could work.
I don���t know, Jim -- maybe you should have been there.
Why don't you just tell him how his actions are being perceived by the women in this office?
Dwight. [to Troy] Michael will be out in a second.
Erin, it's not up to you. This computer was for reception! Okay? It's not yours to give away.
About when you want to give me more of your money?
On your backhand. [Jim opens the conference room door and enters]
Well, I am a few months ahead of you.
I spent a month putting that rolodex on his Blackberry, which he now uses as a nightlight.
Oh my gosh, thank you so much. But seriously, we don't want to bother you any more than we already have.
I've decided to show her around. She really wants to meet everybody.
Jim and I went to dinner a few times when he got back from New York. I talked him through his break up. It's really nice to be good friends again.
You know what would go so great with this cabbage pie? Milk.
Michael, Ryan wants to introduce the branch managers in a few minutes.  You just have to wave and introduce yourself.
Jim said mixed berries? Well, yeah, he's on to me. Um... [Laughs]
Yeah, we don't want them at the wedding thinking Jim's being marched down the aisle by my dad with a shotgum.
[on phone] Yes, I understand.  Can I transfer you to customer relations?
Things are a little slow here. And there's only so much cold-calling you can do in a day. Turns out there's no limit to the number of cheese puffs you can throw at someone's face.
I didn���t watch the whole documentary. After a few episodes, it was too painful. I kept wanting to scream at Pam. It took me so long to do so many important things. It���s just hard to accept that I spent so many years being less happy than I could have been. Jim was 5 feet from my desk and it took me four years to get to him. It���d be great if people saw this documentary and learned from my mistakes. Not that I���m a tragic person. I���m really happy now. But���it would just���just make my heart soar if someone out there saw this and she said to herself ���be strong, trust yourself, love yourself. Conquer your fears. Just go after what you want and act fast, because life just isn���t that long.���
He can only keep one of us as a salesperson now.  He'll make his decision by the end of the day.
I learned from Jim, if Dwight ever asks you to accept something secret... you reply, 'Absolutely, I do.'
Why don't you use the microwave in the kitchen, Phyllis?
Hi everyone.  My name is Pam, and I wear glasses.
At this point, when you're this pregnant, it's kind of like senior spring. The other day I spit my gum out on the carpet.
I���m kidding! Oh my gosh you guys! She���s obviously super cute I get it. But I���d like to point out there���s 50 pounds more of me to love if that���s your thing.
[Pam, Ryan and Michael enter office] Sounds neat.
New York is so exciting. I love my classes. The city's awesome. Um, can you give me back to Jim now, please?
Wait, um, does anyone remember when it was set up?
Well I like to think that his dad was a Ben Franklin impersonator and he really pressured him into it.
Oh yeah.  Gotta get your REM cycle going with the whole sleeping.  Better than not.
Yeah, the bride doesn't really do... Have you ever been to a wedding?
[looks at to Jim] I am. [looks at Angela] It's about the Save The Date.
Good. Good. And���[Nellie hits the car against the bushes]
[runs over after walking over fire coals] Hey! I want to say something. I've been trying to be more honest lately and I just need to say a few things. I did the coal walk! Just, I did it! Michael, you couldn't even do that.  Maybe I should be your boss? Wow, I feel really good right now.  Why didn't any of you come to my art show? I invited all of you.  That really sucked. It's like sometimes some of you act like I don't even exist.  [turns and looks directly at Jim] Jim, I called off my wedding because of you. And now we're not even friends.  And things are just like weird between us, and that sucks. And I miss you. You were my best friend before you went to Stamford, and I really miss you. I shouldn't have been with Roy. And there were a lot of reasons to call off my wedding. But the truth is, I didn't care about any of those reasons until I met you.  And now you're with someone else. And that's... fine. It's... whatever. That's not what... I'm not... Okay, my feet really hurt. The thing that I'm just trying to say to you, Jim... and to everyone else in this circle I guess, is that I miss having fun with you. Just you, not everyone in the circle. Okay, I am going to go walk in the water now. Yeah. It's a good day.
Michael, I think that as the boss you should really---
Kevin, you cannot possibly save enough time to see the world.
Yeah, we walk around, everyone sees our faces and we leave, right?
No I���m just, I���m saying, what would happen if they didn���t sing it? Would they go to jail? Would they be shot?
Yeah, she has a good point.  I mean, for example, with the last thing you said, by the time you explained it, it actually took up more time.
I know you and Dwight have this weird deal, uhm, he sent me out here to see if you could postpone.
Well, you have to choose a food option and there's information in there about directions and lodging...
Thought you were millionaires, yeah. That's funny. Shoot, I knew that one.
Can you put me down I'm getting a little nauseous?
Wow, I thought that was supposed to be, like, next month.
[turns around, is wearing a mustache] Bye, Stanley! Love you! [waves, Stanley leaves]
Yeah I did a watercolor of Frances Willard Elementary School for a contest they were having. They were calling with the results. And I won. I won! My painting won. So I like to thank my mom for always encouraging me. And I like to thank my dad for buying me my first set of art pencils. And I'd like to thank the sixth grade class that picked me.
[after Michael returns with coffee] With cream and sugar?
Did I?  Doesn't sound like me, not very superstitious.
[Pam's car pulls out of parking lot and then off to the side of the road] I told you I'm not dating anyone. And even if I was, I don't think it's anyone's business. I mean, when I do fall in love, like when it's for real, the last person I'm gonna talk about it too is a camera crew, or my co-workers. [Jim gets into the passenger side] Almost marrying Roy Anderson was as close to Pamela Anderson as I ever want to be. [Jim leans over and kisses Pam] Trust me, when I fall in love, you'll know.
...I feel like we should go get Kevin something. Do you think we can sneak out of here?
Well it was great catching up with you. And I'll see you around the building.
Anyone want to see the video from Cece���s recital?
Hello everyone. We would just like to announce that our party is starting now in the break room. So... you can come by... .
Roy gave it to me for Christmas.  I'm trying to figure out how to put songs on it.
Hey, guys! Fun thing. The index cards on your desk are resolution cards. You write your New Year's resolution on them, I'll collect them, and then display them on... da-da-da-da-da! This! Resolution board.
Do you have any leads on a job?
Why would anyone go to jail for that?
If you wanna do something for the funeral...
I also would like to toast Phillip Halpert, who is due even sooner. May he be a good namesake to my grandfather who I promised as a child long before tonight that I would one day name my son after him. To Phillip Halpert!
Hey, Michael. [Michael is sitting on couch outside his office] How you doing?
You know what?  I really think the whole thing is just gonna blow over in like a week or two.
You're so much happier now. Just go in there and be strong.
I'm setting Michael up with my land lady. She's really sweet and... whatever, I just can't take Michael like this.
And I have my original. [holds up original paper, ripped in half]
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh hi ,David. [Michael shakes his head to Pam] No, I'm sorry he's not back from the Civil Rights rally. I'll have him call you the minute he gets back from the Lincoln Memorial.
No. Thanks... uh we're still having lunch today, right?
That means another twelve weeks.  [pause] Can you do this for another three months?
That's weird, my breast pump is missing. Have you seen my breast pump?
[lifting up a diamond bracelet] Oh, my God.
I want to hit you.  I'll do that.
Um... ���A���... ���X���? I don���t -- you got me.
Ok I think animals and proposals are out. Right Ryan didn't you read in one of your blogs that animals are out?
I guess some new people might be coming from Stamford. Should be fun. New blood.
For the record, I wanted go another direction. Which was way better.
No she's going to love it so I think you can keep the proposal simple. You know like when Jim proposed. He just he got down on one knee and he told me that he loved me and he asked me to marry him and it was perfect.
I don't know how the whole betting thing started, but it's fun.
No, I wouldn���t. I can���t even relate to that impulse. But I bet I could get us a customer complaint. I���d like to try.
Yeah. I love being on the road, but I especially love the time and a half pay 24 hours a day, for three days. Cause I have a mortgage now, got a bring home the bucks.
Angela, you have to put a stop to this right now.
Thank you. [takes bite] Oh my gosh. It's really good.
No, I know, like, I kind of like, I thought that maybe you did when I first started.
[sees Angela making check mark on tally sheet]
Um, Fargo, um, Edward Scissorhands, Dazed and Confused...
Robert! Okay, oops! I deleted them all. They���re all deleted.
I���m an oncologist and you are a dog.
Okay fine! There must be some way to get out of it. Even just for tonight!
One of the hardest parts about making resolutions is keeping them. In fact, most resolutions are abandoned by February.
I don't think an apology is enough. I really think the only way for me to learn my lesson is to take my suspension.
Hey Kev, guess what. I won an art contest today.
We���re fine. Yeah. [hugs both Darryl and Andy] And I���m sure that you guys are fine too. Because why wouldn���t you be?
If you���re an artist, you have to be okay with the idea ��that you can���t please everybody all the time.
Sold out? That has never happened in the history of jinx.
Nope.  No, no, that's better.  That wasn't even the worst of them.  I'm fine.
We should get him a bus ticket. [types on computer] To make his trip easier.
[whispering] Um, I���m sorry. I have to go. My daughter���s a ladybug. I know that doesn���t make any sense. Um, thank you, thank you.
Fair enough. Um... I don't think you're a very good person. And forgive me, but I feel like I've said this to you before: I don't like you very much.
No, I'm kidding. Um, so you got big plans this weekend?
Actually Andy, I think maybe we experienced it.
A delivery guy will deliver a box of pens, and you just make sure everything���s in order.
I'm the office administrator now, which means I'm basically being paid to be head of the party planning committee. The first thing I did as head... I shut it down. At its best it was a toxic political club used to make others feel miserable and left out. At its best it planned parties.
Meredith...  [copier has an error] Oh... so uh... G-44.  It's not ready Kevin!
This is a ridiculously awful plan. Because you cut everything.
Wow, Botticelli's, that sounds like a special occasion.
You do realize that we can't serve liquor at the party.
I mean, help, if it's something simple, like add page numbers or laminate it or...
Come on, it'll be fun, and besides, I'm a roulette expert.
What are the odds that this is in any way real?
Yeah. I think you should call social services.
Michael once told me that Home Alone is the saddest movie ever. When I asked him why, he said, 'Because the whole family forgets the kid at home. There is nothing funny about that.'
I don't think you should go to Philly tonight. I think that you should stay and I think we should fight.
Oh, no it's not that, I've actually been thinking that for a long time, and I'm glad I said it. I just... I'm sorry if it made you feel weird.
250 dollars is nothing to the world's biggest Smokey Robinson fan.
[to everyone in conference room] I have terrible news. Someone defaced my mural. They painted all over it.
I thought I'd stay and answer the phones.
It's been a really rough couple of days... This helps a little.
Oh, um, it's just, I didn't, I didn't have a lot of time, so that's just a place holder.
There's an HR meeting in there at 11:30.
The warehouse got a ping pong table last week. Now Jim comes down and plays with Darryl. Sometimes I bring him juice. My boyfriend is 12.
Yeah. Hey, would you excuse me for a second?
[recorded on phone] Excuse me, I have to get back to work.
Oh my God, did you see 'The Apprentice' last night?
No no no, I want to see more of Philly Jim. I want Philly Jim.
He means his mopey place, it's under that streetlamp that he thinks was in Casablanca.
Say they don���t hire you. It���s not like you���re out on the street. You have a great job with people who love you.
During the course of business, a copier goes though something called 'Normal wear and tear.'
Once a year they bring in a little cart and they give away free pretzels. It's really not a big deal. To some people it is.
Hey Angela, you wanna see a picture of Phillip wearing those little booties you got us?
When was the last time you went to the doctor?
Oh, thanks. My Mom made it for me.
I'm sorry to interrupt you. Um, I actually have something very important to talk to you about, business related.
Yes, the conference room is set up. I've got pens, I've got paper, I've got a whiteboard, we are good to go!
Michael, there's a Charles Miner here to see you.
I don't know.  I just, I can't tell if she's getting anything.
I know.  Isn't that always how it goes?
Uh, we brought back some Puerto Rican candy.
Sometimes I don't put Michael through until he's already said something. I look at it as a practice run for him. He usually does better on the second attempt.
Oh, wow, it's almost time for ultra feast!  Where's Kevin?
There's nothing better than a beautiful day at the beach, filled with sun, surf, and uh... diligent note-taking. [holds up notes]
How ���bout we wait til next year after you have your kid?
So, I just wanted to confirm that you're not coming to my wedding.
Nope, that's Dr. Laura. Well, her show Biz Whiz wants someone from Dunder Mifflin to come on the air today. Does anybody feel particularly passionate about local business issues? [Dwight raises hand]
Hey. You know I was engaged before Jim.
I love it, conservation.  Let's start by conserving our time and stop having these stupid meetings.   [stands up and cheers]  No more meetings!  No more meetings! No more meetings!  No more meetings!  [Stanley cheers her on in the background]
Oh Jim, I don't think you're going to abandon this party here all by itself.
Okay. It's been a little more tiring than I thought.
You might want to trim it a little.
Are you going to cry, Jim? Do you need a tissue?
We're small, but we're eager to make a name for ourselves.
No, it doesn't have to just be cow stuff, right?
Phyllis... ended up using the exact same invitations as Roy and me. So it was kind of like being invited to my own wedding. And I was like 'Wait, thought I called that off'.
Yes, I found it in a shelf in the corner of the warehouse. [Darryl gives the camera an odd look]
Hi, um. I'm sorry, do you have a minute? Is this a bad time?
I don't know, I think I was just staring at my desk.
Wait a second, I thought you said that you were hurt.
Oh, and if he makes a joke, just laugh it up, no matter what. Okay?
Well, she can't bring this up with her.
Wow! He really pulled out the big guns. Fake crying. Did not expect that.
I love [leans over Michael's desk to look at his computer screen]... this idea is neat. I've never been. It sounds lovely. [meanwhile Michael looks at the pictures Pam printed out]
Cut.  That was your best apology video ever.
I think you guys all remember my mom from the wedding.
Okay. When I was 22, I worked there and everybody said the place was haunted. I didn't believe it until one day before we opened, I look up into the mirror, you know, behind the bar, and I see this old man dressed all in black, but when I turn around, there's no one there. So, I tell the cook my story...
Hello, Mr. Schrute, nice to see you. Please have a seat.
Yeah, he's so great. Remember how it felt when he cheated on you though?
You know, stuff people didn't intend for everyone to see. And they kinda want to know how much.
There is no rush to get to the hospital.  I am fine.  I'll get there.  And if I don't get there, I don't get there.
Kelly really likes to online shop.  Soooo, I felt like I wanted some new clothes.  I mean, I just, I wanted to, it just, I felt like it was time, to maybe um... just get new clothes.
All I did was remind her that you used to treat her badly.
Uh, no, I um. Everything's pretty much the same here.
[stands up; gets into stance] Okay wait-- it's-- you're saying it comes from the foot.
What are you going to do with your time off?
I think they're even. At various times you gave Jim ten points, Dwight a gold star, and Stanley a thumbs up. And I don't really know how to compare those units.
I mean, we���ve having issues. It can���t hurt to talk about them, right?
[sighs] Oh, I���m sorry. I feel like you���ve already been working insanely hard.
I got Erin a new computer, because the one at reception sucked. I should know. And I don't wanna say the other one was old, but its I.P. number is one! [laughs sheepishly] Right?
But sometimes he talks about flesh��� and bacchanals.
It's just that before, you said that you didn't want any special treatment.
Jim, I got us that dinner reservation. Grico���s at 7:30.
[looking at an engagement ring on Angela's finger] It's gorgeous, Angela.
Dwight's health care memo. I told you about it.
Jim is a great guy. He's like a brother to me.  We're like best friends in the office and I really hope he finds someone.
Aw you'll get through it hon. Just make a game out of it. A funny 'Jim' game.
Okay focus. Focus.  You're in the right building, you're with the right people; what happened?
[in the car] We still surprise each other.
I guess this is just one of those days.  It'll get better.
Oh, Michael. You can't be nasty today. [whispering] 'Cause of the... [points to 'Welcome Daughters!' sign]
Well, I didn't think that butt was funny.
Good, especially after I took all your money in poker.
[telephone ringing] Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. Hold, please. Dwight, it's the Sheriff. He said that it's really important. It's regarding your desk. I'll transfer.
Yes! Because with all of your support, by this time next year maybe I'll be down to one glass of iced tea a week.
I mean, I don't know. So... what's it like dating a cheerleader?
You get paid by the year at the bowling alley?
So I'm going to Carbondale this afternoon to get a new bulk shredder.
[voicemail message for Jim] Calling from my cell phone.  I don't know if you guys figured out who did that to Michael's carpet yet, but I have a theory that involves an inter-departmental conspiracy.  Everybody in the office.  We need to talk.
Because I���m so glad you���re back, baby, but I���m just���I was talking to Darryl, and he was talking about the trip, and I just feel like you���re giving up so much.
Wow, there are, there are questions to that. Okay. Um, you know what, no questions. Last item on the agenda, Toby would like to make an announcement.
It all started when Dwight was tapping his foot against the leg of his desk. When I asked him to stop, he said, 'I will when you lose the baby weight.'
Here's what we think happened.  Michael's sidekick, who all through the movie is this complete idiot who's causing the downfall of the United States, was originally named Dwight.  But then Michael changed it to Samuel L. Chang using a search and replace, but that doesn't work on misspelled words, leaving behind one Dwigt.  And Dwight figured it out.  Oops.
Why do you need to wear the holster at all?
[pulling her new shirt out of a box] Ok.
Yeah.  Wait, what, the mess or the note?
Oh. Ok. I've heard you exclaim. Like the time you said, 'Hey, look. We parked over here!'.
What is it? [Jim lifts the hog maw with a fork] Don't touch it.
Okay, first off, my Keds. Because I couldn't have done it without them. [people clap] Thank you. Let's give Michael a round of applause for MC-ing tonight because [people start clapping again] this is a lot harder than it looks. And also because of Dwight too.
Actually, it's kind of too bad we're not coming into work tomorrow.
Well, I though we were saving money for the wedding, but apparently Roy thought it was more important to buy two WaveRunners. I don't really ever get to use the other WaveRunner that's supposed to be mine because his brother uses it and they race.
Oh great. Um, no, this weekend? Nothing. I'm not really doing anything.
Erin, you don���t need to call him that.
[reads memo] 'Sleeves down to the wrists, buttoned-up collars, and muted colors.' Nobody dress like that. [camera pans over to Angela]
Hey, I would just love to schedule a meeting today with Dwight.
Roy and I just got back from the Poconos.  I get ten vacation days a year, and I try to hold off taking them for as long as possible, and this year I got to the third week in January.
Yes, I know, but it's gonna be different.
I could work here. I could see this.
I have a way to make Scranton a better place, you could leave it.  [laughter]
I dunno. I mean, maybe he'll talk to you about some of this stuff 'cause he can't really talk to me about it.
Nellie, I could practice with you in my car at lunchtime.
In his office. You can go right in.
No, under no circumstances can you read that letter. It's a violation of her trust.
Maybe you could play a song on your recorder.
0-1-7-5. Thank you. Bye, bye. [to Michael] It really makes us look unprofessional.
Michael told us to wait in here. We don't know why.
Yeah, okay, I���m sorry. I���m sure we can get a copy. A lot of people were taping it.
So this was all just a trick. You don���t really have any business to give?
I'm happy for him.  I hope he gets the job.  I really just want him to be happy.  And I know that sounds cliche.  And I know saying it sounds cliche, sounds cliche...  Maybe I'm being cliche.  I don't care.  Cause I am what I am. [thinks] That's Popeye.
[on phone] Look, I'm not going to tell you that we have lower prices. Is price something that is important to you? Ok, well let me know if anything changes.
Today's a 'women in the workplace' thing. Jan's coming in from Corporate to talk to all the women about... um... I don't really know what. But Michael's not allowed in. She said that about five times.
You know, like aren't some things just so nice and cozy in the rain?
So, it really is just about the cupcakes.
[in New York] That's what she said! That's what she said! That's what she said!
I hate the idea that someone out there hates me. I even hate thinking that Al-Qaeda hates me. I think if they got to know me, they wouldn't hate me. But Karen knows me, and she still hates me, so...
Next time we're all in this room Jim and I will be married.
Michael sends me a postcard from every vacation he goes on. Atlantic City, he wishes I was here. Busch Gardens, Virginia, all I got was this lousy postcard. And this time, I'm Jamaican-him-crazy. I don't know how far away he thought he was, because he put $10 worth of stamps on this.
...and he said, That's what everyone sees, that's the Man In Black.
The architecture reminds one of a quaint Tuscan beet farm.
I���m afraid that you���re gonna resent me and I���m afraid that���
Uh, they're good. Uh, Jim's good. We're engaged.
Umm, Stanley. Maybe you could just unspool a little more each time you need to...
I don't think so Michael. Besides, I can't cheer against my fiance.
Oh.  I think you should get it.  You've changed a lot and you'd be good at it.
The day's going fine. It's been a little chaotic but it's fine. It's great! A lot of distractions. But, it's good.
I'm sorry. Did that? That was out of the blue-
He finally has a story everyone wants to hear... and he knows it.
The news that you just announced?  That Ed died?
Look, I know what you have to do, please stay with Cece. Dwight? I've always considered for us to be very good friends. Great friends! Remember your concussion?
Wait, when did we start calling it that-
Ummm. Oh! I'll say he's related to Richard Nixon. It's an inside joke. He looks really Nixon-y when he wakes up.
I don't think so, but they put paint where I didn't want paint. So...
No. [Kevin leaves; Pam takes off her glasses; phone rings] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Okay, go ahead. [puts a notepad close to her face and writes message]
Ah, yeah. We haven't told anybody, but it's going really great. [looks at Jim] Right?
Michael just rented The Devil Wears Prada. He has his NetFlix sent here to the office, and he watches them in pieces when things are slow.
I have doubts about this too. But when one person freaks out, sometimes it weirdly makes the other one calmer. That's one thing I've learned about relationships. I hate that I just used the word relationship. [Michael comes out in a suit] Hey! You look great! [checks something off her list] Let's go!
Well, the last pick-up for overnight deliveries is at seven. So you need to have them signed by then. Or much earlier.
Never underestimate the power of a good night's sleep.
You missed two big conference calls today, one with corporate.
So what are you going to get me instead?
Oh, can I help? We could say someone is related to, uhm, Tonya Harding.
Yeah, but there's other, better people out there who are helping.
Today is my first day at my new job at Michael Scott Paper Company Incorporated. You know, Apple Computers started in a garage. And we're starting in a condo. So we already have a leg up on Apple. [picks up piece of mail] Look, it's official! [door opens, Michael is in a bath robe]
I had just woken up. I didn't look cute. That's how I knew he meant it.
[on the phone with a client] I just wanted to check and see if there's anything you needed before I went on my maternity leave...  Yeah, I'm pregnant...  Great, well, I'll write up the order.  Okay, thanks.
I think so.  I don't know, I was mainly focused on the cup holders.
When you're a kid you assume your parents are soul mates. My kids are gonna be right about that. I guess it also means that sometimes love affairs look different to the people inside them. [Andy is in the background, looks incredulous]
Hey, where have you been all night? I was looking forward to hanging out with you.
He just so happy to have a family plan.
Oscar said WUPHF only has enough money for nine days.
Well, I wish that made me feel better. Listen, so everybody saw the promos and they're kinda freaking out. [Brian laughs] Cause it seems like you got a lot of private stuff on camera-
Do you mean, leaves as in dies? You want us to throw Toby a New Orleans' funeral?
OK. Dwight. Are you really in charge of picking the health care plan?
I called the doctor like a week ago.  I couldn't wait...  Oh, God, don't be mad.
I'm at a crucial point where I have sunk 4 hours into that copier, and I am not going to let it beat me like that wireless router did.
The guy has an algorithm to determine the winner of any given college basketball game.
[opens door] Erin.  Michael wants to see you.
Yeah?  I lose my appetite all the time.
Oscar, wait. I think the victory would be more meaningful if Erin puts the last word in herself.
A few months ago. I was talking to someone at corporate, who isn't there anymore, and I think the paperwork just got lost in the shuffle. Can you believe that?
No, I umm, well I'm not gonna, I'm, I'm not gonna move in with anyone unless I'm engaged.
Well, my dad can't hear a thing. You could boom his whole life for him.
You know, Michael. When I feel overwhelmed -
She has a boyfriend. He's out of town.
Well, what about the other stuff that has to be in today?
No, I liked him. For a couple of days. Four years ago. [Jim nodding repeatedly] You know I have a kid with you, right?
We'll find another receptionist. I mean, that's easy. We'll be fine. [Andy nods reluctantly]
You can buy new stuff but you can't buy a new party.
She says 'no' to everything. You know, she thinks my name is 'No.' Cece, do you want some broccoli?
Oh, I made us a date to take my mom out to dinner to thank her for all that extra babysitting.
I think he thought his ukulele skills would transfer. [Jim leaves]
[knocking on Angela's car window, Angela is naked inside] Hey in there. It's Pam. It's not Dwight! Don't think it's Dwight!
Hey Dad. No I know, Mom told me. Ok. Yeah I'll see ya then.
I'd remember talking about Jim. That wasn't it.
We only had tonight free, and we really wanted to spend it with you.
Five bucks if you can get him to admit it.
Be careful. I pulled my mom's dog off a pillow once, and I got bit.
And I guarantee, that you will be satisfied! 'Cause your satisfaction is our guarantee! We guarantee it. We look forward to doing business with you too. Thank you Russell.
Um, I think I'm gonna be up at the lake.
And there are a lot of other people in this office who have money at stake. Other people you care about.
We don't have any money. We don't have an office. We don't have anything.
So place it on the infinity thing without being obvious, you know? I'd love to do like a color version just to bring a little color to the logo.
And looks so handsome in his UNIFORM! Please?
The one in the really great mesh black high-back swivel chair?
Yes, but David Wallace does. And he asked me to gather everyone to talk about stuff... That's gonna be revealed once we're in the conference room for the meeting.
[in unison] I do not think that is funny.
I just wanted to let you that Dwight's gonna be ok.  The doctor said there's a really simple treatment for a concussion, so he'll probably even be back at work tomorrow.
For us, um, nothing new, really the kids are great.
Because, um, cause I'll never wonder ever again. If I did something wrong and... Now I have closure. She's happy and, I don't know, it feels good.
Oh, I can not believe I fell for that. [laughing] Oh, my God.
Okay. I lost my engagement ring in ceramics class. Left it in my smock. I had this whole thing where I go back to class, wrongly accuse another girl. Look I even used makeup to put a ring around my finger, you can hardly see it, it's very subtle.
I'm gonna need the name and cell phone number of the housekeeper responsible for changing the sheets, please.
So we basically had no privacy for ten years.
It says here you cater to the eldery.
Uhh, huh, ho... oooh my God, you are ridiculous!
Are you sure you don't want to play?
Do you want me to help you with that?
I didn't tell you about the crying because I didn't want you to know how upset I was. Because it would've stressed you out and you're always saying how much you don't want more stress.
Jada, Darryl, I'm so glad I found you guys. A grinch stole the star from on top of the Christmas tree and is hiding it in the warehouse somewhere. You want to go help me find him?
Exactly. That should tell you how terrible the chairs are.
They're considering him for a top secret mission. There's his application. Oh, and this is where I made him list every secret he promised he'd never ever tell.
Ok fine I���ll draw him. [hangs up phone and draws]
No, no, that guy who hit on me.
No, it's fine.  I'm sure it must have been weird for Jim when Roy and I were joking around... that
We signed Cici up for this daycare. It's on the other side of town. The traffic...
No, I get it, of course. OK. [holds out hand for folder. Jim gives Pam back the folder.]
Um, actually, funny story -- I didn���t get it. I shouldn���t have been so cocky about my rectangle-holding skills after all.
Well I don't think you're gonna be very happy with this.
This is our first joint sales pitch. I think we're gonna work really well together.
I don't know I'm really committed to winning.
So now everyone hates Andy, and it's this whole mess, and I don't know what to do.
Is this what I've become? Materialistic? Shallow? I feel horrible. [looks down at the check] oh look! 'Mrs. Pam Halpert!' That's the first time I've seen it in writing!
Oh, some guy exposed himself to Phyllis in the parking lot.
Back off, Dwight. [serves] Hyuh! [the opposing team misses the ball, the Scranton team cheers] What?
I feel like [Pam look's out the window and camera pans out in The Office]--Dwight is holding a candle and reading a poem.
Um, did my dad say anything about my mom?
There's a finger-painting station and a curly slide. Am I too old to go here?
Right.  And, you wouldn't be able to talk to Karen.
Okay. I'll go look for another one. [she leaves]
I know a lot of us have been feeling under the weather lately. It's that time of year. And according to a study done by the University of Arizona, they've discovered that your keyboards have hundreds of times more bacteria, per square inch, than a toilet seat.
Well yeah, but what if we turned our mike packs?
Oh, don't worry about it. I mean, it's better than listening to Michael play a conch shell... which is what I was doing. Oh, also, Michael went to Jamaica with Jan!
Um, just cause, that, you work together, and it might be awkward.
Okay, I know I���ve been crying easily today, but- [shows unfolded paper Jim dropped, shows two lists, ���Pam��� and ���Cece��� on one side, ���Everything else��� on the other] I mean, that���s just pretty killer, right? I mean, maybe it���s stupid. No. [starts crying] It���s wonderful. I���m gonna frame it. I can always unframe it.
Oh my God. Is that Jan? [points to same monitor]
Hey, Angela.[hands her a Save The Date card] I didn't have your zip code.
Roy has a connection. It's nicer than you think.
I'm confused. Am I walking down the aisle to 'You Can Call Me Al?'
[on phone]: Did you send Dwight on a quest for the Holy Grail?
Yes, I'll be sure someone returns your call.  I'm so sorry.  Bye.
Listen our credit card has been cancelled and we have to deal with that, and I really can't handle the fact that you're calling us here!
Cece was around 22 weeks, but Phillip was much earlier.
So you have an office and a workspace?
I think you need to go to Florida.
No no no no no! She'll wake up!
So ok. I'm watching the movie, by myself...
Don't get on it. [Michael inches toward elevator]
I could tell Jo... or I could tell Michael.
[in New York, humming to herself to the tune of 'Centerfold'] Na na na na na. Na na na na na na na.
[on phone] Cici has been calling me 'Pamela'. Like four times this week.
I am going to tell her, but now is clearly not the time.  I will buy her a wig, we'll have a few laughs. There's a right way to do this.
It's nice having Katy around. It's another person for Michael to um, interact with.
We couldn't do it without you, so we postponed.
[enters on Michael alone sitting on a bed watching Glee] Michael? Maybe you should try gong in the other room again. You can have my seat. It's closer to the TV. It'll seem louder.
I wish we'd started this exercise six months ago. My heart just feels so... blocked up.
It's not too bad. I get to shred things sometimes, do you want to see?
It says ���Lotto Pool���, right on top. [points to obvious title]
When a child gets behind the wheel of a car and runs into a tree, You don't blame the child.  He didn't know any better.  You blame the 30-year-old woman who got in the passenger seat and said, 'Drive, kid.  I trust you.'
Oh! Yes! [Group cheers, Dwight moves to driver seat]
Uh, just one second.  We're in a meeting and I'll see if he's available.  It's Jan.
When Michael's skirting a phone call, he gave me a list of places to say he is. 'Stopping a fight in the parking lot. ' 'An Obama fashion show. ' Whatever... that is. Or 'trapped in an oil painting.' I'm gonna save that one.
I know.  If she wasn't an alcoholic before, she is now. [Jim laughs]
Michael's been trying to get Jim and me to hang out ever since he started dating my mom.  I don't know.  I really hoped this thing would just die out, but today he's planning a birthday lunch for my mom and we have to go.  No way out.  No way out.
Actually, people are really unhappy. Um, Dwight sent around this memo and people are freaking out 'cause the...
It's 'whom' when it's the object of a sentence, and 'who' when it's the subject.
Am I being mean to Dwight? I don't know. I did just make him run around the building and I have no intention of timing him. This isn't even a stopwatch. It's a digital thermometer. He does make my life harder, sometimes. And on purpose. Like he tried to put meters on the bathroom stalls as a way of bringing in more money for the company. [yells to Dwight] Hey, three more laps to go. Gotta pick it up if you're going to beat Toby.
I have one idea of what it means.
Michael, do you need me to call an ambulance?!
Ten years ago, I didn���t care if Dwight  got married or died a beet-farming bachelor.  But having kids makes you so soft. I used to watch Pulp Fiction and laugh, and now I���m like, that poor gimp is somebody���s child.
So he doesn't share it with his daughter but he shares it with his daughter's fiance?
Why is there a circle with a line through it?
Is there a volume knob on that thing?
Okay. [picks up and reads sheet]  The Michael Scott Foundation is still in existence?
Well what was I supposed to do, let you walk all over me?
I don't often miss Roy. But I can tell you one thing. I wish someone had flashed me when I was with Roy. Because that would have been the ass-kicking of the year. [small laugh] Especially if it had been Jim. He would not have wanted me to have seen Jim's... Whoo, I am... I am saying a lot of things.
Yes. But there's, wait, oh, there's a funny ending to that story. I can't remember.
I won't. It's just that last night is really hard for me to remember because I was just a teensy bit high. Should I have not said that?
If I'm being completely honest, I could've done without the belly kiss.
No, we um, we had plans for a third, but then I don't know, you never called me back, so...
I did it. I learned everything about this machine.  I know all the buttons, even the inside ones.   I know all the error messages.  I could do a bound book, in plastic with offset colors.  Which feels...
[Reading Jim's palm] You're major and minor lines cross at a ridge - that sucks.
You talked to the man whose wife you're having an affair with.
Oh. Hey how about at Thanksgiving we prank Tom about being bald?
Every time Michael's in a meeting, he makes me come in and give him a Post-It note telling him who's on the phone. I did it once, and he freaked out. He loved it so much. The thing is he doesn't get that many calls. So he has me make them up every 10 minutes.
Okay. Sorry. We'll uh, we'll leave you alone.
Yes. But John Stamos was temporary. I quickly moved on to-
Oh no, I just, I decided to stay.
OK. Well, here's something you don't know. A couple of weeks ago-
Oh my God, what is going on, is Dwight ok?
I was going to say good because I'll have all the help I need?
[opens up her present] Oh, my god! Thank you very much, Santa, whoever you are. It's awesome.
Have you ever had a conversation with Kelly where she didn't go on for 15 minutes without taking a breath?
I can't do this. I don't have this sales gene, or whatever it is. Tell me everything is going to be ok.
[whispers to Jim] Hey.  Something just happened.  Dwight just told Angela that she has to deleted all of her sensitive e-mails immediately.
But have you ever actually seen him yourself?
Oh come on. You really think I'm gonna have a fourteen pound baby?
Well, he seems really happy being back here at Dunder Mifflin.
[answering phone] Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam. He's not in the office. Can I take a message? I will. You too. [hangs up] Sorry. What's up?
Michael and Jan together in Jamaica. I guess I would just need a little bit more evidence than seeing it with my own eyes.
Stop eating it! Do you wanna be happy? Look at you. You have a major self-destructive streak in you.
He could have broken your nose or something.  Crazy.  It's just so stupid.  I mean, getting back with Roy and everything.  I mean, what was I thinking, right?
[on phone] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh hi, David. He's having a colonoscopy. Alright, I'll find out if he's out yet.
[pointing to the window in Michael's office] Oh, Michael marked his heights. He's grown!
Much different the second time around. And I have to say; it is nice not being the only pregnant woman in the office.
Great! I thought you could use this time to authorize some checks.
[Pam and Oscar are trying to repack cardboard box] Yep, yep.
When Jim decided to come back to Scranton full-time, I was relieved, but I also feel a little guilty. I mean, he���s giving up this big thing for me. But he seems happy. I mean, he���s certainly been goofing around a lot. I love goofy Jim.
I'm sorry, can we just hurry this up? I've got a game to get back to.
You know what? It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.
[voicemail message for Jim] Hey, Jim.  It's Pam.  I keep looking up to say something to you and then Michael's there and it's horrible.  Anyway, I'm bored.  Come back!
I���m back. Oh, hey, look, and now it���s like a double date.
Yes!  Thank you, welcome to my personal hell!
No. No no no! [nos coming from all employees]
I don't want to look at your friend Jasmine's boobs all day.
Yeah, that's right.  We could do a three-day weekend.  I wonder if I could, like, call in sick on the Friday.  Then I get a four-day weekend.
Yeah.  Dwight, Michael wants to see you in his office. [Dwight runs in]
Really? Okay, well, um, I like consistency in the manager's position, no weird silent coups. Stuff like that. I'm easy.
Oh, I have more. [Holds up bags of candy]
Yeah, just a little, I have a lot to deal with today.
He's really making you work for it, huh?
Yeah, he's making me take notes on these meetings and I'm, like, 'These people are my friends.' But he's all like, 'This is confidential. You can't tell anybody.' But I just feel like I want to... aaah. Just promise me you're not gonna say anything.
Hmm. I don't think so. But thanks. My building manager... is... You understand.
[looking at pile on Michel's carpet] Oh... I don't know.
This could be real. Dwight's pretty handy with computers. He fixed my laptop once.
Oh, can we stop by that pie stand on the way?
And Jim's mom suggested that Jim spend time hanging with the kids in his reading group, because she though that would be a good influence.
Say that I'm lying or say that I have the job. Make a definitive statement, Gabe.
[enters the office and has another contraction]  Oh, whoa.  Ha.  Wow.
Um, so, finally, I want to thank God. Because God gave me this Dundie.
Hey, let's focus today. Make today all about focus. I'll help you.
[studying mural wall] I guess if I make a mistake, I can just paint over it with a shrub or something. It���s just, I think less of paintings with a lot of shrubs. So, I���m gonna limit myself to one shrub.
Now that I think about it, Angela and Andy might actually make a good couple.  But I couldn't do that to Dwight... or Angela... or Andy.
[on the phone] Michael, it's Ryan for you.
I'm sorry. You guys have probably noticed my stomach's a little more sensitive lately. So, if you wouldn't mind wearing a little less perfume... and if your lunch is especially pungent, maybe have it in the break room?
I was hoping for a righteous mob, and I ended up with Dwight and Nellie. But, they both have a mob mentality. And, I'm pretty sure Dwight has a pitchfork in his car.
[reading flavors] Despera-dough. Witchy-womanilla. Why do they do this?
You know what? It's fine, it's fine. Let me just...it's fine. [Pam leaves work bus]
Hold on, hold on.  It isn't midnight yet.
[exiting the Ladies' room] Mine too. [Pam and Jim notice the Handicapped stall and walk towards it.  Putting their ears to the door they hear Mr. and Mrs. Vance being intimate]
No, no, no, it's fine. I was just commenting. We gotta get these out, open 'em up.
Michael, Dwight's looking at gay pornography on his computer.
Listen, um��� I was scared, you know? I loved what I had, and I didn���t want to risk it. And I think that maybe I did doubt him a little too. Which was wrong because he���s shown me time and again. But when the documentary started airing, people on the street told me that I had this fairy-tale romance. But there were a lot of times last year where it did not feel like a fairy tale. But then it got deeper, and it got stronger and now it���s better than a fairy tale. It���s like a long book that you never want to end.  And you���re fine with that because you just never, ever wanna leave it.
Sure did. I was as surprised as you, but apparently, he is very passionate about public art.
Yeah. I was kinda hoping you could. I gotta go. Bye. [to Dwight] Come on. [camera pans to Clark duct taped to a chair]
Okay, you just have to use the hand sanitizer first.
She's coming in today and maybe just don't joke around about that stuff in front of her.
Well, you��� you bought the house without telling me, so I thought I could sell it without telling you.
What do I think? I think everybody should stay out of everybody's personal business!
The thing about pregnancy is people treat you differently. Like you're a kid almost. They lose all sense of boundaries. They start acting weird, telling you things that clearly aren't true. I know it sounds nuts, but I think Dwight is the only one who's telling me the truth.
[raises hand] What is the cash value of a Schrute Buck?
So um, I've been thinking about this whole chair/copier thing...
Yeah. Painting now. I just want to make sure that...
Hey, Karen. Sorry about that meeting today, that was really crazy.
Ahh!  I'm sorry, I didn't, I didn't see you come in.
Yeah. I think maybe I want a 'wedding' wedding.
Nothing, it's just I had to sit here all day, while Phyllis got like an entire garden delivered to her.
And, I feel God in this Chili's tonight. WHOOOOOOOO!!!!
You know, I just think it's really important that you be productive today.
These are my painting clothes.I think I���m gonna do it. I am really gonna start painting the warehouse mural today. [Jim applauds]
No, not... we're not... we're not having problems. But it is personal. And I would love...
Okay everyone, I know we're really excited to see this movie that everybody's in, but we have to remember that Michael is sensitive, so let's stay positive! And no laughing, no comments, just positive energy and we'll have a pure fun day! Okay?
[gets up and walks over to Angela, whispering to her] Hey. Thanks for ratting me out!
Hey Oscar.  It's Pam. Hey. We're on our honeymoon.
Hey!  This is not half-way!  I did the math.  I had to drive way longer than you.  Montclair would have been closer, so you have to buy lunch.
I know how to operate my phone, okay? Listen, we���re getting close. We will talk to you later. Say, ���Bye, Daddy.���
It's awkward asking people for money, but we could really use it. Why doesn't Crate & Barrel let you register for a toaster full of cash?
Yesterday, they delivered the new one. But they didn't set it up. So my day just got a little more interesting. [holds up a huge manual]
No Dwight, not the good peanut butter. People are going to get mad.
No, normal women don't do stuff like that. This is bad. [Karen nods and Michael looks like he's about to start crying]
I mean, who knows? Maybe I have a niece my family never told me about.
Okay, well, my confession is that today I had a sip of coffee. But that's fine.
Nope, and we're gonna need a loaves and fishes kind of miracle to feed 'em all.
I'll go.  [stands up, begins speaking with a southern accent]   My name is Deborah U. Tante.   Deb for short.
Sales people can go later in the day. Hourly works can go at lunch.
Forget it. I'm never gonna know what goes on there.
It's nice. It's funny. It mentions his tonsillectomy and makes a funny little joke about his moustache.
Andy, did I dream that you were crying through the night?
Oh, my God.  His letter of recommendation from Rick Santorum is three fifty-dollar bills.
Yeah. I���m afraid he���s only gonna have hot dogs.
No, no. Jim had a great year, actually. I just wanted to get your opinion.
Um, I can offer you free delivery on any order that you place today. Okay, twenty boxes? I can do... just a second. I can do 20 boxes at 43 dollars a box. Great!
Ok.  There's a transcript between a naval ship-
Okay. So I went on the Internet, and she is not gonna find another apartment for that price. I mean this one is twice as much, and it doesn't have parking. Does she like to park?
It's a good shredder, it just keeps breaking.
I think that I should help him get home.
Ok, but listen. We just don't have the budget for it. Okay? Reception needed a computer so we got one.
I've heard that. [reaches down to pick up bagel from the floor]
Hey, Erin, it's Pam. How ya doing? No, no, don't put Cece on the phone, because she can't talk yet. Okay. No, I was just calling to see how everything's going. Yeah? Yeah? It's good? The play? The play is kind of great. I mean, it's fun to hear Andy sing in the appropriate setting. Now, he's really sorry you couldn't make it, too. Yeah. So thank you so much, again. We're having a great time. Oh, they're flashing the lights so we should go in. Thanks. Bye. Okay, so we called. And everything's fine!
I wouldn't go if things weren't so solid with Jim. And down the road, if we have a family, I couldn't go then either. So, the timing's perfect... And that is the first time I've ever used the word 'perfect' in here!
Nothing.  I was just thinking of something else.
49 again? That's nine years in a row.  This is now our longest family tradition.
I know it's wrong to fake going into labor just to get out of things, but sometimes it's necessary.
And we'd like to offer you 15% off your first purchase as our way of welcoming you to the area.
Right here. Little Michael Scott- [points to her belly]
Well, to speak my truth, I switched to coffee in March.  There's a new espresso machine. But I still acknowledge and appreciate the gesture.
We need more food. I'll go get some subs and sodas.
Who cares? [Michael peeking at them through his office window] It's not that huge a sale.
So Sarah Kaya says to Eric, 'No way.  You can't reserve seats.' And Stacy gets all up in her face and Sarah Kaya picks up Stacy's new PM pad and throws it at the light box.
Oh, no we're actually married. We're not brother and sister.
[putting mayo on Creed's head] Creed, I'm all done. My turn.
Fine! [eggs splatter all over his robe] Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
[looking up from her pilfering of Bob's food] What?
Oh, we wanted to, but our sitter just fell through. I'm really sorry.
Hey honey, I don't think we should push him.
Well, we're thinking of my grandmother who we haven't told and is very old-fashioned.
[asks Nellie who is tapping a pen on her desk]. Is everything okay?
What if I back out and you finish the pitch with Jim?
Yeah, I distribute so I get all the memos.
No, no, it's not a big deal, please. No. Um, Meredith can I get you something special while I'm at the store, candy, or...or one of those stylish turbans?
I am-- I am-- I am trying to make everything perfect here, okay? So that you can have everything that you want.
Apparently Michael has come up with a Dunder Mifflin Mad Lib, and he's making us play it with him. We are so happy. No. I'd like to choose a different adjective.
Do I at least get to go with you in this fantasy?
You didn't happen to bring any coffee, did you, Michael?
Yeah. Hey Michael, look at this lamp. $8.00.
[exchanges looks with Jim] You're right. We should've realized that you are an equal part of this.
What could Jim have said to make my dad want to leave my mom? And at what point in our marriage is he gonna say it to me?
[in car] Hey, my aunt told me something neat.
[Michael offers his coat to Pam, who is shivering] Oh, thank you.
Aw. It's OK Angela. I have mommy brain too.
You're probably upset that I'm even at a Laundromat right now.  But, don't worry, I'm being safe.  And I'm headed home.  I'm... headed to my dorm.  Not home.
Yes, Jim���s friend is starting anew company based on this idea Jim had when they were back in college.
Great. Everything's great. Hey are you nervous about your big meeting?
[ascends on lift, using megaphone] Attention, everyone. Can I have your attention, please? Yeah, I don't know everybody's name down here, but whoever did this will you please raise your hand. [no one replies] Hello? This is not over. OK? I will stay up here all day if I have to. Is that what you want? [descends on lift] Yeah, I will also come down if I want to. It's my choice.
Because we're usually not on the same page.
Oh, we're not interested. We're not interested at all.
Lord of the Ring stuff? I don't know, I'm just trying to think of things that were happening at the time.
So are you going to be like totally awkward around me now?
Uh, I've been engaged for three years, and there's no end in sight. So... you don't wanna ask my advice.
[to camera, tearing up, smiling] I'm sorry, what was the question?
[loading up car with Michael] Don't look up. Don't look up. [sighs as office workers all looking from window]
Okay, Okay. Um��� so��� this past year has been really great, and you���ve been great and I just��� I know that you had to make this choice and you had to give something up for me. But I never want you to have to give up anything. I just thought if I could get us an offer then there wouldn���t be anything standing in our way and I could come to you with this big Jim gesture��� and show you all at once just how much I love you and how much I really do believe in your future.
He left it at reception and we photocopied it.
Well, I will be spending the entire afternoon in grief counseling for someone I've never met.
So my corner's the one with the copier?
Do you guys want some food? The wings are really good here.
Okay, well she takes her convictions pretty seriously, she can be kind of severe.
Oh, my God! It's incredible. [Jim reaches and steals his card back before she can notice it] Is this the Boggle timer?
How can you give us performance reviews if you don't know us?
[laughing] Oh-ho-ho! He talked about himself in the third person?
Oh, do you mean Darryl? That's a great idea. I'll ask him.
[whispering] Hello? Yes, this is Pam Halpert. I got the mural? [Loudly] Oh, my God!
I don't really have any control over that Stanley.
Oh, that wasn't the night crew. That was Dwight.
That's okay I can... I'm fine. I'll just play a song in my head.
Roy's sister looked into it, and the application alone costs a thousand dollars.
Uh, yes.  Please have a seat. It'll be a few minutes.
Hey, Cece, Daddy���s gonna have dinner with us tonight after he comes to your recital. Are you excited?
Andy, I am getting married in 8 hours.
I have so many people to thank for this award.
[changing voice] Good afternoon Iris, it's a pleasure.
I don't think it would be the worst thing if they let me go because then I might... I don't think it's many little girls' dream to be a receptionist. I like to do illustrations. Um... Mostly watercolor. A few oil pencil. Um, Jim thinks they're good.
Stop texting, put your phone away!  Come on.
Ok [squeaking sound] Oh that was just me. Pregnant Pam. And I make sounds much worse than this.
One, and then wrap around.  It's okay.  Hold that arm down.
Hey, Michael, why don't you just get down.
Um, I don't think so, I just bought it.
[laughs] You're very quick on your feet. I remember you. Funny.
Yeah, but I mean, look at the salary. And it's definitely a step up. And a challenge.
Why do you always think that girls are gonna be at the party? No one invited girls. It's just us.
He locked himself in his office all morning working on it.
[going up to give Dwight a hug] Thanks for much for helping the company, Dwight.
Oh, excuse me! I'm fine with my choices!
[everyone yelling at Pam]You guys, I am so sorry! It's just been so chaotic with Jim gone, that...
I went out to look for a better office space.
You have a guitar slung on your back. I did not know you played guitar.
Oh no, do you think it was stolen?
Just don't talk about the email, okay? He's gonna cancel it on his own, I really think he will.
Mmmm, that sounds great.  What are you thinking?
It's my first day back after maternity leave. And I miss Cece, of course. But we need the money. What was maternity leave like? Oh, how do I explain it?... It rocked. It rocked my ass off.
What's that come to? Like, what did they each win?
Sure, uh, Jan... um, do you know, is anyone coming back to Scranton?
It���s probably gonna be a few minutes. So you can just go back to doing whatever you were doing.
So someone is going to a court. Big deal.
Are you really going to apply for work at Scranton Breadworks?
[mimicing Katy] Oh definitely, definitely step in and out of it like that.
No, it's not that. Um, I was just wondering, since I'm probably going to have to stay late, could you ask Dwight to stay late too so he can walk me to my car?
Okay, everyone, I've tallied the votes, and the winner... of the costume celebration spectacular... and the Scranton Wilkes-Barre coupon book... Oscar Martinez.
Wrong baby!  This is not our baby!  Sshh.
Thanks! Yeah, so I'm just going to take care of things around the office and get paid a reasonable salary. You believe that, right?
No, I mean it. [walks towards Michael] She's really nice and sweet and you guys might actually get along. [hands over card to Michael]
Jim. Jim, Jim, Jim. I'm not threatening you. I love you. [whispers] But you should know, you're on very dangerous ground [kisses Jim]. [at normal volume] All right.
[walking into the annex with Jim] Hey, um...
Andy that's way too personal of a question.
Jim, Jim, honey, I love you, but you're really distracting me from my distractions.
Ok, wait, so that would make me [walks to side of room] like right here.
Oh, um, well, you know, I��� I just��� I just think I would rather keep that private. You know, if you���d been filmed for nine years of your life, there���d be some things that you just wanna keep to yourself.
It would've been just as easy for him to spell insect. Of course, that wouldn't have made any sense either.
Police are a hassle. We settled this on the street.
Maybe it was Meredith. Maybe she brought in lice that are totally different than the lice that i got from Cece. So let's not jump to the simplest conclusion that she got her lice from me. That is how wars get started. Fine, I'll tell her it was me.
[loudly] I need you to sign this! So bad!
No, no, no, 'Tracks of My Tears' and what else? What are some more? What's one more?
No, wait. Hey, while you are out, could pick up some paper towels and chocolate syrup? We have ice cream so I thought...
We discuss... [Angela and Phyllis giggle] the idea of doing the party totally normal. Like, not mean. Just a regular party. [giggling stops] Not mean.
Hey Oscar, big Will and Grace fan huh?
Because the thing you're saying I'm good at, is pushing a big green button a bunch of times.
No, okay. It's fine. It's fine. We're just gonna add 'find office'...
Michael, we were thinking maybe we could keep this thing going!
Okay, when you���re selling to women, it is crucial that you listen, Dwight. Also you want to respect their... Are you listening now?
Yeah, I'd love to see them. Oh, and tell them I say, 'Congratulations.'
Why was he making her laugh so much?
[embarrassed] Yes, thank you. [finishes banana and hands server the peel]
Yeah! Oh, so I guess Oscar and Jim were talking your ear off about the new copier.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. No, no, no, no.
Why are you assuming you'd get the whole thing?
Well I'm having my baby first, so that's that.
It's cold Dwight. Just shut the door and let people come in the front.
No, I know that you���re, like, happy and, like, you had fun today.
What's the rule about eating when people are in the bathroom?
And it is so cute how she signs her name.
[in a car with Andy, by the dumpster you can see a new computer box] So listen, we have to really scuff this up.
And, I haven't gotten paid yet. I'm not blaming you.
[Michael walks in dressed as Willy Wonka] Good morning, Michael.
Well Darryl, no kid wants to buy their own Christmas presents.
You know, there are a lot of guys out there who would just love and appreciate a-
I'm pretty happy these days. I'm getting married soon and I'm getting along with everybody at work.
Yeah. Oh, you should come to my art show, by the way.
[Pam���s phone vibrates] Oh, text from Jim. ���This is getting very weird. Will explain later.���
They���re the ones who put a fish tank next to a basketball hoop. It���s like if I put a glass of milk on the edge of the table and Cece knocks it over, I don���t blame Cece.
Sick, like lots of sniffling. I don't know.
It's performance review day, company-wide.  Last year, my performance review started with Michael asking me what my hopes and dreams were, and it ended with him telling me he could bench-press 190 pounds.  So, I don't really know what to expect.
