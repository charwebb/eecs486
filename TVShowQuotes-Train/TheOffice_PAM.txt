Oh, my God. What are we gonna do?
Ok, well, we're going to a bar. Hey. You have to come to stuff with me. I'm serious! If you're going to be my boyfriend, you have to do boyfriend things.
[runs over after walking over fire coals] Hey! I want to say something. I've been trying to be more honest lately and I just need to say a few things. I did the coal walk! Just, I did it! Michael, you couldn't even do that.  Maybe I should be your boss? Wow, I feel really good right now.  Why didn't any of you come to my art show? I invited all of you.  That really sucked. It's like sometimes some of you act like I don't even exist.  [turns and looks directly at Jim] Jim, I called off my wedding because of you. And now we're not even friends.  And things are just like weird between us, and that sucks. And I miss you. You were my best friend before you went to Stamford, and I really miss you. I shouldn't have been with Roy. And there were a lot of reasons to call off my wedding. But the truth is, I didn't care about any of those reasons until I met you.  And now you're with someone else. And that's... fine. It's... whatever. That's not what... I'm not... Okay, my feet really hurt. The thing that I'm just trying to say to you, Jim... and to everyone else in this circle I guess, is that I miss having fun with you. Just you, not everyone in the circle. Okay, I am going to go walk in the water now. Yeah. It's a good day.
How come out of everyone in the office, I'm the only one that went with you? Is it because I'm that stupid? I mean, your own grandmother doesn't even believe in you!
When Michael's skirting a phone call, he gave me a list of places to say he is. 'Stopping a fight in the parking lot. ' 'An Obama fashion show. ' Whatever... that is. Or 'trapped in an oil painting.' I'm gonna save that one.
Because they have a great design program, and I wanted to see if I was any good at it. And I wanted to work on my art, too.
I've really been putting in the hours on this mural. And my boss is totally OK with it, because he's in the Bahamas and has no clue what anybody is doing. I'm usually very self-critical. I hate what I paint. But, I don't know, this time I feel like it's, um, it's really coming together... [sees mural] Oh my god! [camera pans to mural with butts painted over it] Wha? You've gotta be kidding me! What it... are those... are those butts? [to warehouse crew] Huh? No way. No way!
[Jim comes out of the office]  What's the news?
[laughs] Jim does the best impressions. Sometimes he'll look up at me from his desk and he'll just be someone else. Like he'll go um, [makes mournful face, giggles] that's supposed to be Phyllis.  I can't do it as good as he can.
You know what would go so great with this cabbage pie? Milk.
Well, she can't bring this up with her.
Yeah. No, no, I'll um-- the hundred. I'll just take the hundred.
Hey, Dwight. Jim and I found your wallet in the parking lot.
And spend time with George Emerson.  That's what I would do.  I mean it's the best male protagonist we've read, right?
I just wanted to let you that Dwight's gonna be ok.  The doctor said there's a really simple treatment for a concussion, so he'll probably even be back at work tomorrow.
Michael has so many pictures of his kids he had to get two phones with two numbers and he pays two bills.
I feel like I've been kinda cold to Karen and there's no real reason for it. I mean it's not like she's ever done anything to me. So, I think I probably shouldn't be cold to her.
No, you should have her mom do the boring Christmas stuff on her time. You should be associated with the fun parts of Christmas.
Just to reiterate, none of us is going to say anything that might indicate that we are going broke.
Okay, Phyllis sits across from him every day. Phyllis, does he have a moustache or not?
Michael screened a work in progress for us, years ago, and it didn't go well. We thought it was a comedy. [flashback clip of Michael angrily leaving the conference room while the whole office is laughing at the tv] Everything pointed to it being a comedy.
No, no. It's the principle of the thing.
What? No! No, I just had this brilliant idea- everyone loved it. You don't have a copyright on pranks. I might be better at this than you.
Oh. [laughing] I really thought I didn't get it.
Okay, that's a lot of good ideas. Thanks
Yes. It is. And thank you so much for setting up this opportunity, I really appreciate it.
I can't. I'm really sorry if you misinterpreted things. It's probably my fault.
Aw you'll get through it hon. Just make a game out of it. A funny 'Jim' game.
Jim said mixed berries? Well, yeah, he's on to me. Um... [Laughs]
You know what?  I really think the whole thing is just gonna blow over in like a week or two.
Of course, now Michael knows where to reach me 16 to 18 hours a week.
No.  No, but I'm allowing it.  Just come here.
Maybe it���s a list of people he���s gonna fire.
Okay fine! There must be some way to get out of it. Even just for tonight!
Yeah, you don't grab these [gestures to her chest] for balance.
But I've learned to love again. [puts her arm on Jim's shoulder] He's a cartoon sailor.
What could Jim have said to make my dad want to leave my mom? And at what point in our marriage is he gonna say it to me?
[to Roy in Jim's earshot] ...back so soon.
So what did you want to show me?
Ok. All of these things are important to remember but the most important thing is no one say anything about my pregnancy at the wedding.
Yes. You guys, I have the perfect idea. Ok, it will just take me ten minutes.
I had just woken up. I didn't look cute. That's how I knew he meant it.
There is a master key and a spare key for the office. Dwight has them both. When I asked, 'What if you die Dwight, how will we get into the office?' He said, 'If I'm dead, you guys have been dead for weeks.'
Okay, when you���re selling to women, it is crucial that you listen, Dwight. Also you want to respect their... Are you listening now?
Hey Oscar.  It's Pam. Hey. We're on our honeymoon.
Oh, can we stop by that pie stand on the way?
No, okay. It's fine. It's fine. We're just gonna add 'find office'...
Did you wanna do that now? We can go inside. I'm feeling kind of good tonight.
Thanks! Yeah, so I'm just going to take care of things around the office and get paid a reasonable salary. You believe that, right?
So are you going to be like totally awkward around me now?
Yeah, but aren't you supposed to do that to our... no. It's great.
[yawns] Yeah, or no... well... I don't know. I'm sorry. I was up all night with Cece, otherwise I'd be running this.
[screams out in the parking lot, Michael watches from his office window]
It's actually based on a book called Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.
About when you want to give me more of your money?
Hey! Our baby was not a mistake. She was a surprise.
So, does anyone wanna know where I've been for the last 2 hours?
[laughs] You're very quick on your feet. I remember you. Funny.
We decided that there's no way Dwight would harm a child.
Michael, do not let your imagination run out of control.
It's just that before, you said that you didn't want any special treatment.
Sure.  There's a transcript between a naval ship and a lighthouse.
Wow, Botticelli's, that sounds like a special occasion.
And Michael, you don't have rabies. And chances are you're not going to get it anytime soon. So... you don't really have to think about it too much.
[on phone] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Just a second. Michael, it's Jan on the phone for you.
[voicemail message for Jim] Hey, Jim.  It's Pam.  I keep looking up to say something to you and then Michael's there and it's horrible.  Anyway, I'm bored.  Come back!
Dunder Miff...Michael Scott Paper Company, this is Pam. Oh, hi Russell from the pancake luncheon, how are you? Well we'd like to do business with you too! How can we make that happen?
I know that Jim has an amazing story about a relative of his who got caught up in the world of drugs.
Not really. It's kinda weird that a grown man is singing from the point of view of a little girl.
Be careful. I pulled my mom's dog off a pillow once, and I got bit.
Andy's family had a total meltdown.  His dad blew through all their money and took off to Argentina with a younger woman.
I think you guys all remember my mom from the wedding.
[walking through the office, notices Andy with Erin's computer set up at his desk] What the heck! Why do you have Erin's computer!
It is extremely stressful, planning a wedding by yourself. It's like a job. I mean, it's fun, but it kind of becomes like work. I've already planned it all out in my head. But it's just in my head.
I'm having contractions, but they're irregular and far apart.  So I'm not really in labor, I'm near labor.
Seriously? Because it sounds like one of those is better than the other.
Hello, Mr. Schrute, nice to see you. Please have a seat.
I ran into this guy from my high school who has just gotten divorced and he hit on me. In the mall. And I didn't tell you because, I don't know, I felt embarrassed. And, I didn't know if you would be mad or worried. But, anyway, I thought you'd want to know.
No, wait, come on.  I didn't miss a day, I came in early, I stayed late, and I doubled my sales last month.
Michael tends to procrastinate a bit whenever he has to do work. Umm, time cards, he has to sign these every Friday. Purchase orders have to be approved at the end of every month. And expense reports, all he has to do is initial these at the end of every quarter. But once a year, it all falls on the same Friday and that's today. I call it the Perfect Storm.
No, no, no, 'Tracks of My Tears' and what else? What are some more? What's one more?
No, I didn't mention that you cooked your foot.
OK. [to Darryl] Do you know the plate... never mind. Why would you know that? And why would I be asking that?
I have a way to make Scranton a better place, you could leave it.  [laughter]
I-- I thought they were confused at least...
[on phone to Jim] There���s nothing down here.
Hey Oscar, big Will and Grace fan huh?
I'm supposed to be Olive Oyl. And it makes more sense when I'm standing next to Popeye, but... Jim doesn't want to put his costume on.
Mmmm, that sounds great.  What are you thinking?
Oh, my God, [eating a bar in the hallway] I thought I was gonna pass out.  [Jim takes it from her and takes a bite]
Yeah, enjoy this moment, because you're never going to go back to this time before you met your desk mate Dwight.
A few months ago. I was talking to someone at corporate, who isn't there anymore, and I think the paperwork just got lost in the shuffle. Can you believe that?
Remember yesterday when we were terrified of being parents?
[Ryan and Dwight enter] Hey, Ryan, are you ok?
Well, ya know, Michael is a great delegator. He never does any work himself. Ever. And one time, I walked in on him naked, and his thing is so small. [quickly walks off stage] If it were an iPod it would be a shuffle! [clapping, laughter]
I don't think any of them are supposed to shred magazines.
[enters conference room] Did you need me to take notes?
[Hunter's voice starts singing, Pam joins in] One night...
Parenting? Yeah. This is Cici���s favorite magazine. She loves the pictures of babies.
Actually, the distractions are good.  I mean, I don't think I'm going to make it until midnight if I'm just sitting here thinking about it.
I'm sure no one asked you to do that.
Hey, guys! Fun thing. The index cards on your desk are resolution cards. You write your New Year's resolution on them, I'll collect them, and then display them on... da-da-da-da-da! This! Resolution board.
Maybe I played a little in junior high... and in high school... maybe a little in college... and went to volleyball camp most summers.
Listen, when Jim was dating Karen, I didn't want to come to work. It was awful. I hated it. I wanted to quit, but-
I can tell Michael's mood by which comedy routine he chooses to do, the more infantile, the more upset he is. And he just skipped the Ace Ventura talking butt thing. He never skips it. This is bad.
Jim had a crush on me on the booze cruise or he told you about it on the booze cruise?
Erin, you don���t need to call him that.
In his office. You can go right in.
Yeah, I would've. What about you? Come on, there's gotta be something. Between your birth and the last two days, something you just haven't had the chance to tell me.
You want me to write down people's indefinable qualities?
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. [makes 'talking' gesture with her hand]  Jim, come on, we gotta get in there and practice.  Okay?  I'm not kidding!
[whispering] I���m so sorry. I hate this. You���re better.
[opens up her present] Oh, my god! Thank you very much, Santa, whoever you are. It's awesome.
It's okay, honey. [Philip cries] It's okay, it's okay.
It's like squishing a spider under a book.  It's gonna be really gross but I have to look and make sure that it's really dead.  Sooo... [to camera guys] If you guys see anything... ?
Don't you think the person who left the mess is the obnoxious one?
I saw it.  I saw it, and it was amazing!  Who said I didn't see it?  Did Jim say that I didn't see it? I saw it!
No, I���m not upset. I���m really excited for Darryl��� Maybe I���m a little disappointed that we���ll be losing him.
I can't believe he's getting a CAT scan.
And it is so cute how she signs her name.
No she's going to love it so I think you can keep the proposal simple. You know like when Jim proposed. He just he got down on one knee and he told me that he loved me and he asked me to marry him and it was perfect.
Oh, some guy exposed himself to Phyllis in the parking lot.
Are you really going to apply for work at Scranton Breadworks?
Well, Toby will stop it. Anytime anyone���s ever been fired, Toby���s blocked it, so���
Um... Actually, we don't have any staff birthdays coming up.
I mean it's a very competitive field. But I have a professor who says I have a lot of promise, and if I don't try now, I never will. So...
Nothing happened. We went on a couple of dates. He never called me again.
A little different. What time is it there?
Yeah, we should do that for real sometime.
No, wait. Hey, while you are out, could pick up some paper towels and chocolate syrup? We have ice cream so I thought...
Okay, everyone, I've tallied the votes, and the winner... of the costume celebration spectacular... and the Scranton Wilkes-Barre coupon book... Oscar Martinez.
Phyllis! What are you talking- The whole card depends on this!
Jim set up a job interview for me today in Philly. It's um, with a real estate company, which is a great fit for me because I live in a house and I know what a bathroom is. [laughs] I'm sorry, I am just very nervous because honestly this is all moving a lot faster than I expected. And, and because my resume can fit on a post-it note.
Okay, so here's what I'm thinking. I'm gonna say that before ceramics class, I took off my ring, and then when I changed back out of my smock, it wasn't in my pocket anymore, and I lost it.
No, nothing.  Nothing Michael!  Just saying hi. [Michael waves 'hi' at the phone]
Uh, just one second.  We're in a meeting and I'll see if he's available.  It's Jan.
[at her desk, grabs her plant and sees it dried up, looks at Jim] Oh. You couldn't have watered it?
[on the phone] You can fax it over. Yeah, 5-7-0-5-5-5-0-1--
Oh, I don't know... [Jim laughs, phone rings] Oh my God.  This is Jan's cell.
Yeah, Bob Vance took her for a walk to calm down.
Mema's not coming to the wedding. She's leaving tomorrow morning.
Okay, heart-shaped jewelry is not something that a woman buys for herself. A man definitely bought it for her recently, and it wasn't Michael.
Oh, no we're actually married. We're not brother and sister.
That's fizzling. I mean, someone has to start the fizzle.
So when do I get to hear everything? Are you still getting unpacked or... you want to grab a coffee or something after work?
Uh, they're good. Uh, Jim's good. We're engaged.
You get paid by the year at the bowling alley?
Guys, I think we should all ease up on Meredith. This has got to be hard for her.
Oh, I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
You were way meaner to me than I was to you.
That's weird. I mean, that's weird to have sex in the office. That's where you work, right?
Why do you always think that girls are gonna be at the party? No one invited girls. It's just us.
Of course. He's one of my closest friends.
Come on Angela, don't you have a game?
[as everyone begin to leave] No, no. Come on, guys. Don't go.
And then you stopped at the bar on the way back?
All I did was remind her that you used to treat her badly.
Maybe it'll be good because then she can like socialize with the other babies.
I'm gonna to miss Toby. He has a nice, calming presence in the office.
There's no one from England, Jim.  Katie studied in Ireland - this is Stacy, the one who does the Murakami-style collages.
[after Michael returns with coffee] With cream and sugar?
Okay, you do not have to do this.
So I closed the door but the image of his...
No, I mean doing that with Michael. How do you come back from that?
I feel like he���s always making these decisions for the family, and then I���m left playing catch-up.
Mmm! Good pate, right? [Matt nods yes] Oscar made it. Have you met Oscar?
Michael likes me to run the camera when he makes his apology videos.  He says he needs a woman's touch.
Ravi, our amazing pediatrician, was asking us if we knew any girls and I said I know the perfect girl.
Don���t you guys have everything. I mean, its just a paper company.
Oh, all my stuff is still upstairs so...
It's possible that some people thought it was your birthday.
Maybe we can get him to hide and wait somewhere.
Please hug and kiss me, no matter how hard I struggle.  I'm too shy to tell you that I love you.'
[to Jim] Just go in.  Just go in, he probably forgot to text you.
Yeah���turn signal. It's exciting to be painting again���those are the wipers. So���the���its���just. There you go! Yeah. [chuckles]  Yeah, things get so busy with the kids���red light���that it's nice to have that creative outlet���red light! Red light! Red! Red!
Because she's not a sex model.  She's a tollbooth operator.
Here it is. [Andy is still singing] Suite 401.
I need to get out of this dress.
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh hi ,David. [Michael shakes his head to Pam] No, I'm sorry he's not back from the Civil Rights rally. I'll have him call you the minute he gets back from the Lincoln Memorial.
No, I liked him. For a couple of days. Four years ago. [Jim nodding repeatedly] You know I have a kid with you, right?
What? You have something you want to say?
There's a person here who wants to sell handbags.
What was that?! [everyone runs to Michael's office window]
Oh, oh my gosh. Yes, but don't, don't say anything, okay? It's after my grandfather.
I have it covered. [hands Dwight a decorated box]
Because I just wanted a relaxing evening at home...
[to Jim] Hey. I feel so lucky we're in the same city for Valentine's Day.
Okay, weirdo.  Come on.  It's time for cake.
Well I like to think that his dad was a Ben Franklin impersonator and he really pressured him into it.
Hey, Dwight, um, my friend is kinda into these two girls that he works with.
Thought you were millionaires, yeah. That's funny. Shoot, I knew that one.
Nope. 'Cause we're really nice people but you don't seem to like us.
We have to come from a position of strength.
This is possibly our new Dunder Mifflin office.
Hey, I was talking to Cathy. Turns out she is single.
[Delivery man enters with a bouquet of red roses. Pam stands up to look at card.] Phyllis.
Andy that's way too personal of a question.
Yes.  She was a little fussy earlier, but she's totally quieted down.  Here, let me just, uh, let me just burp her.  I don't want her to spit up on you.  Come here, sweety...  Oh, my God!  Wrong baby!
So how much antigravity potion do you want?
Cool, are you coming back to say hi?
I love you, but I'm kinda busy. So I need you to figure this one out on your own.
We have a meeting with an investor today.
I also would like to toast Phillip Halpert, who is due even sooner. May he be a good namesake to my grandfather who I promised as a child long before tonight that I would one day name my son after him. To Phillip Halpert!
[Jim bows to Pam; she bows back] Thank you.
Planned a wedding with him. He wanted hot dogs.
[on phone] Dunder-Mifflin. This is Pam. [listens] Uh, yeah. [snaps her fingers in the air, getting Jim's attention] Just one second. I will, uh, transfer you to our manager, Michael Scott.
Mom, I'm sorry. I know you and Dad are chipping in for the wedding but I do not want orange invitations. Yes! Well, if you really want my...
Yeah, I didn't go through with the wedding.  I got cold feet, a few days before.  And I can't really explain it.  I just had to get out of that relationship.  We still had to pay for all the food.  So we froze it.  But I'm, I'm doing well.  I have my own apartment.  I'm taking art classes.  And I have lunch for the next five weeks.
I don't want to look at your friend Jasmine's boobs all day.
[wearing glasses] Um... yeah, I slept over at a, uh, friend's house and, I forgot my contact solution, so... I had to wear my backup glasses... Shut up.
Why would anyone go to jail for that?
My dad spent the night at our place last night.  My parents have been fighting for weeks and... it kinda sucks.  Jim's been great. But I'm gonna need to buy my dad a robe.
You don't look reluctant, Michael. You look really eager.
Okay, well, my confession is that today I had a sip of coffee. But that's fine.
I don't know what to tell you, Jim, but I saw a ghost.
OK, I can tell you're mad at me. Do you wanna just, um, I don't know, tell me why?
And I've always believed that we should all be involved in everyone's personal lives, in a very major way.
Oh my God, did you see 'The Apprentice' last night?
Michael. Okay, I'm... I'm going to talk straight to you because I think you need to hear it. Michael.
I'm not asking if you're in to her. Just, objectively, do you find her attractive?
Wrong baby!  This is not our baby!  Sshh.
Katy and Jim met in the office. And now I guess they're like going out, or dating, or something. And, uh... I don't know! You know? They're just... She calls him, and they... You know, I'm sorry. I feel like I'm talking really loud. Am I talking really loud?
Uh oh. Someone started off on the right foot with the new boss!
You shouldn't be fired. I mean, you were just protecting me.
Yay Kevin. Whoo hoo for Kevin! For stinking up the bathroom.
Yes, but Reception is a one person department. If I get you a new computer I have to get one for everyone in sales. For Dwight, for Stanley, it would be crazy.
Have you heard anything about any secret office romances?
I forgot I have to support him no matter what. Close one.
I know.  If she wasn't an alcoholic before, she is now. [Jim laughs]
Uh... no. I just uh had some other stuff I had to do.
Hey, Abby! Do you want to help me shred some old documents? It's actually pretty cool.
Oh no, do you think it was stolen?
Yeah.  Dwight, Michael wants to see you in his office. [Dwight runs in]
Does that mean an idea that blows up in our faces later? [Pam's phone rings]
What if I back out and you finish the pitch with Jim?
Three hours from now or three hours from earlier like 4:00?
Oh, hey Jim. Some prankster switched the elevator buttons on Dwight.
Good, especially after I took all your money in poker.
No. My goodness. You have a lot going on. With Robert and everything.
[reading from Michael's flier] 'Drugs: Let's not and say we did.' I think Michael was high when he wrote this.
Well, I'm gonna say something to the producers.
Jim, just don't think of it as degrading. Think of it as, you happen to be moving the six inches his way and he happens to be biting it.
[telephone ringing] Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. Um, hold, please. [to Jim] There's a Brenda on the phone for you. [to Brenda] Just one second, I'll transfer.
Whoa, that's kind of condescending. Would you say something like that to Jim?
[to Jim] Go up and check on him. He's upset.
Yeah, yeah, but I uh... I switched stuff around because I actually needed like more room for organization. So...
Uh, could I please have your attention? So a year ago, I got my first art commission to paint a mural for Dunder Mifflin and I decided to paint the history of paper���,which was just some trees and stuff. And then someone spray painted a bunch of butts on it and I had to start from the beginning. But it all worked out for the best because I think that I���ve painted the perfect thing which is the history of us. All of us. And this is for you Jim. [applause] And go ahead! [drape drops and everyone cheers]
Shut up, Hide! ��I mean, do you think Kevin cares what people think about him-- or Creed or Meredith? Oh my gosh, these are my role models now. You know what? I���m okay with that.
So Santa, what can we expect from this party?
Everyone, Let���s take our picture in front of the mural. Oh, um, I just���I kind of meant just everybody from the office.
This is weird with you facing the other way.
Uh, I'm sorry Andy, but this is a closed club.
I learned from Jim, if Dwight ever asks you to accept something secret... you reply, 'Absolutely, I do.'
Oh no, I was confused by your phrasing.  You should definitely go out with Jim.  I mean, you're going out with Jim.  I'm not going out with Jim.  You're dating him, which is awesome, because you guys are great together.
It's cold Dwight. Just shut the door and let people come in the front.
Yeah, we don't want them at the wedding thinking Jim's being marched down the aisle by my dad with a shotgum.
Let me just say, you've been promising me this chair since the day you hired me.
Hang up. [Creed hangs up] Corporate needs you to find the differences between this picture and this picture. [shows Creed two similar-looking photos of some building] Intel has told us there were at least seven.
Really? Okay, well, um, I like consistency in the manager's position, no weird silent coups. Stuff like that. I'm easy.
I don't think it would be the worst thing if they let me go because then I might... I don't think it's many little girls' dream to be a receptionist. I like to do illustrations. Um... Mostly watercolor. A few oil pencil. Um, Jim thinks they're good.
Yeah, that's weird. I thought they only played the Police.
I know you Michael, I saw you naked.
Ok, well it wasn't obvious so... [phone hangs up]
Oh. Hey how about at Thanksgiving we prank Tom about being bald?
Because if I had spoken my truth sooner about not wanting to move to Philly, then maybe we wouldn't have had this opportunity for couple's therapy.
Sorry. What do I want? What do I want... Oh, it's a pencil cup.
Why did you put Dwight in charge of that? He did a horrible job.
OK. [Goes out onto terrace] Oh wow, you have a nice view.
Dwight, want me to get you some eggnog?
Yes, well, you guys all know Cece, but we wanted to introduce you to baby Philip.
And there are a lot of other people in this office who have money at stake. Other people you care about.
You know, maybe we should just have our own pregnancies and not pretend like we���re in this together.
I think maybe there actually is something I don't know about Jim.
So it turns out Donna and I have a facebook friend of a friend in common, so I was able to see some of her pictures online. [pulls out picture of Donna embracing a man and smiling] This was taken two weeks ago. And this was taken the same night. [pulls out a picture of Donna kissing the same man] This photo was taken this morning. [shows a baby picture] It's Cece. [laughs] She's never gonna do anything wrong.
You just still have these messages from yesterday.
[walks in the conference room where Jim and Dwight are playing ping-pong] How's it going?
Um, excuse me. I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
No it was really it was really sweet. It was raining and..
I know. It's totally going to change the way I work out.
Dwight, what are you doing!? We've only been in here for, like, two seconds!
Next time we're all in this room Jim and I will be married.
I, I was gonna say, I think that um, we're gonna help Roy's cousin move.
[to Michael who is looking at a chair catalog] Did you pick a new chair? It's been awhile.
Cupcake. It's cupcakes and strippers all the way down.
[sees Ryan on the horse] Oh, boo! Boo! Boo to you! Boo!
Um, I think I'm gonna be up at the lake.
Hey, Michael, where have you been? [Michael shoots pool ball up into their faces]
So you invested ten thousand dollars to look like a team player?
And we need bodies in both these rooms, people. So please sign up.
[to Dwight, who is reading the want ads] Should you really be so blatant about that?
Good. I thought you were going out for a drink with...
Oscar, no. This is not the time for one of your principled stands.
I am-- I am-- I am trying to make everything perfect here, okay? So that you can have everything that you want.
I love it, conservation.  Let's start by conserving our time and stop having these stupid meetings.   [stands up and cheers]  No more meetings!  No more meetings! No more meetings!  No more meetings!  [Stanley cheers her on in the background]
He's uncomfortable because you're acting weird. So you have to stop acting weird.
I'm sorry I thought this job was for the position of office manager.
Okay, Michael. Um, you know I love when you do that voice, but today, I'm so sorry. I need you to tell me that you know you're not Cece's godfather.
Well, I remember why I dress the way I do at work.  But I'm gonna keep the clothes.  I mean, it'll be cool to just have some after work clothes that aren't pajamas.
I honestly think you're idealizing people here again, Michael. I don't think that's gonna happen.
Oh! [Jim reenters bus through hatch] Hey! How'd it go?
Okay, Okay. Um��� so��� this past year has been really great, and you���ve been great and I just��� I know that you had to make this choice and you had to give something up for me. But I never want you to have to give up anything. I just thought if I could get us an offer then there wouldn���t be anything standing in our way and I could come to you with this big Jim gesture��� and show you all at once just how much I love you and how much I really do believe in your future.
I kind of thought something would happen tonight too.
We don't have any money. We don't have an office. We don't have anything.
No. It was a total waste of time. Um... it was fun, though, because I got to spend the day with Andy Bernard. He's really cool.
You didn't happen to bring any coffee, did you, Michael?
Did you find anything good in your desk?
You came up to my desk, and said, this might sound weird, and there's no reason for me to know this, but that mixed berry yogurt you're about to eat has expired.
Mo Chuisle. He's watching Million Dollar Baby... He's gonna try to kill me.
We can watch a movie and play Rock Band.
That's weird, my breast pump is missing. Have you seen my breast pump?
Anyway, we also have a special on envelopes.
It says here you cater to the eldery.
It didn't have anything to do with race.
I'm gonna do it. And I fully expect to burn my feet and go to the hospital. That's the right spirit when doing a coal walk, right?
[to Jim] Shush. [to Kevin] Kevin, a playful touch on the arm, or on the back, it can show your interest and it's really romantic.
I don't have any DUI's so I can drive myself, but thanks.
It's kind of like that lip thing she did last night, like a half snarl, half smile? I get the sense that she's very ironic.
No I���m just, I���m saying, what would happen if they didn���t sing it? Would they go to jail? Would they be shot?
I think they're even. At various times you gave Jim ten points, Dwight a gold star, and Stanley a thumbs up. And I don't really know how to compare those units.
Well yeah, but what if we turned our mike packs?
I had to work late. Jan's making me keep a log of everything Michael does all day.
[Michael is Army crawling around the office] Michael?
[on voicemail, because she's calling Jim at the same time] Hi, this is Pam.  Leave a message.
You do realize that we can't serve liquor at the party.
Okay, you just have to use the hand sanitizer first.
I���m back. Oh, hey, look, and now it���s like a double date.
[to Roy as Jim escapes into bathroom] Are you kidding?
[in the car] We still surprise each other.
Todd, you're just saying insults in the form of an apology.
Yeah, do you need a hand? [everyone joins in]
Oh, I can't do lunch. I was just sending you an email. Jim and I need to leave early today to meet with our contractor.
It's perfect. You emphasized the golf, completely omit the Florida.
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. [excited] This is Pam. I did?
We���re fine. Yeah. [hugs both Darryl and Andy] And I���m sure that you guys are fine too. Because why wouldn���t you be?
Come on, it'll be fun, and besides, I'm a roulette expert.
No, it's fine.  I'm sure it must have been weird for Jim when Roy and I were joking around... that
Yeah. Oh, you should come to my art show, by the way.
Then who do you think will get the job?
You're probably upset that I'm even at a Laundromat right now.  But, don't worry, I'm being safe.  And I'm headed home.  I'm... headed to my dorm.  Not home.
I got her.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay...  Jim!  She latched!  She latched.
[turns around, is wearing a mustache] Bye, Stanley! Love you! [waves, Stanley leaves]
Hmm. I don't think so. But thanks. My building manager... is... You understand.
You know, I just think it's really important that you be productive today.
I was going to say good because I'll have all the help I need?
One of the hardest parts about making resolutions is keeping them. In fact, most resolutions are abandoned by February.
That's cool. [opens the container and smells the tiramisu] Mm, good stuff. [throws it in the garbage]
I'm happy for him.  I hope he gets the job.  I really just want him to be happy.  And I know that sounds cliche.  And I know saying it sounds cliche, sounds cliche...  Maybe I'm being cliche.  I don't care.  Cause I am what I am. [thinks] That's Popeye.
[throws resolution board away in dumpster] Lesson learned.
Okay focus. Focus.  You're in the right building, you're with the right people; what happened?
Nope, I don't have a card, but I'll do you one better. A little scrap of paper.
My theory is that... [Jim signals he's leaving, waves bye to Pam]
I almost lost it. That was too good.
Maybe it was Meredith. Maybe she brought in lice that are totally different than the lice that i got from Cece. So let's not jump to the simplest conclusion that she got her lice from me. That is how wars get started. Fine, I'll tell her it was me.
I know that I shouldn't have done it. But I was in the parking lot at the Quick and Easy.
It's not too bad. I get to shred things sometimes, do you want to see?
I don't know if there's really a private place in this office.
We need to come up with one realistic thing that we could do today.
Dwight is taking Ryan on a sales call today. So if we find Ryan's body in a heavily-wooded area tomorrow, I owe Jim $30. It's an old bet, but a deal's a deal.
Why was he making her laugh so much?
Actually, I put the catalog in your hands 'cause you have to pick out a new chair.
[smiles] Go ahead.  I think it's your turn.
I think we broke his brain. [they both snicker]
[on her cell phone] Hey where are you? Yeah, we were supposed to meet here. What? Oh my gosh! That ties in perfectly with something that Michael was telling me earlier! I just don't know what some of the people in, like, accounting are going to do? It said specifically that...
Okay, be careful, Kevin. They're kind of spicy.
Nice. So, should I reschedule the rematch with Darryl now?
Why do we have to see what Dwight says?
I can't tell if she's getting anything.  It just doesn't really feel right.
Nellie, why don���t you  tell Dwight what we were doing earlier today. And Dwight, you show us that you���re listening.
[taking paper from Kevin] Oh that's mine! Um, I'll just, I'll get it out of the way for you.
Well, maybe we can put the box back together.
It's 'whom' when it's the object of a sentence, and 'who' when it's the subject.
Please? Kelly's trash talking me because Darryl is beating you.
Perfect boobs, [gives a look at the camera] of course I remember Holly.
Hey Michael!  I have a present for you, but you have to come down and get it.
Oh my gosh, thank you so much. But seriously, we don't want to bother you any more than we already have.
Hey honey, it's me. Just trying to catch you before going home. Um, oh, well just give me a call whenever. Hope your day got better. Love you.
Hey, Karen. Sorry about that meeting today, that was really crazy.
Come on Andy! I mean you said you wanted a new computer and this is the best I could do!
Michael, I think that what Stanley did to you was rude.  Maybe you should just get him aside and tell him that he was behaving badly.
Hey Angela, you wanna see a picture of Phillip wearing those little booties you got us?
No, it's not that. Um, I was just wondering, since I'm probably going to have to stay late, could you ask Dwight to stay late too so he can walk me to my car?
No, I'm kidding. Um, so you got big plans this weekend?
Oh, you mapquested it. It's four blocks away.
I'm here. I'm a part of this now.
I'm not frustrated. Even if I were in Scranton, Jim and I would have days like this. We're just... a little out of sync.  You know, that's all.  Oh, great.  I washed my lipstick.
He's not saying what he needs to say.
I guess this is just one of those days.  It'll get better.
Is it a good message or a bad message?
We have maybe a month.  I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Maybe she's just pushing her breasts together to make them look bigger.
Phyllis has gotten into audio books and lately she's been listening to 50 Shades of Grey.  Which, if you don't know what it is, it's a book about um...
No no, you can go home. I'm good.
[to cameraman] What? [looks at Dwight eating a Baby Ruth] Ohhhh... Yes!  Thank you!
Right... you're a sports writer in Philadelphia? Nice build too.
Oh, it's Creed's birthday today.  Should we get him an ice-cream cake?  Mint chocolate chip?
This isn't about sides. This is about me seeing a blueish gray old man in the mirror and then he vanishes.
Robert doesn't talk like that. You have to stop Dwight from doing this.
Alright. Just don't worry, we'll figure this out.
I'm just gonna go home. My mom's been watching the kids all day.
Hey, have I told you you look really nice today?
You have to get rid of all your weapons. All of them. Including killer fish.
It's just so dumb. [chokes up] But when he describes himself as a child, lost on the life raft...
Have you ever had a conversation with Kelly where she didn't go on for 15 minutes without taking a breath?
I don't think we registered anywhere. We just want cash.
On your backhand. [Jim opens the conference room door and enters]
I think you're thinking of The Hunt for Red October.
I use to love coming here.  The chicken parm is good.  Big part of my childhood.  Oh, maybe Michael will start dating that too.
I know.  Isn't that always how it goes?
Sometimes Michael gets nostalgic and he talks about the classic gang. That's Michael, me, Jim, Dwight, Angela, Kevin, Oscar, Stanley, Phyllis, Creed, Meredith, Kelly and Ryan. We're a regular Ocean's Eleven.
I mean, who knows? Maybe I have a niece my family never told me about.
Hey, why don't you just go up to your office, get some work done, and I'll just bring you a pretzel.
I just keep getting bored. And I let things build up and build up and then I - I, I do something too big, like this. Who does this?
He could have broken your nose or something.  Crazy.  It's just so stupid.  I mean, getting back with Roy and everything.  I mean, what was I thinking, right?
Hey, Deangelo, my mom just sent me this picture of Cece, it is so adorable.
Okay. When I was 22, I worked there and everybody said the place was haunted. I didn't believe it until one day before we opened, I look up into the mirror, you know, behind the bar, and I see this old man dressed all in black, but when I turn around, there's no one there. So, I tell the cook my story...
You need to get something for your girlfriend.
Okay everyone, I know we're really excited to see this movie that everybody's in, but we have to remember that Michael is sensitive, so let's stay positive! And no laughing, no comments, just positive energy and we'll have a pure fun day! Okay?
250 dollars is nothing to the world's biggest Smokey Robinson fan.
He means his mopey place, it's under that streetlamp that he thinks was in Casablanca.
Michael, you've had two ideas today. And one of them was great. And the other one was terrible.
[to Michael] What's the matter, you can't fight your own battles?
For us, um, nothing new, really the kids are great.
I can't do this. I had a real job. I sat ten feet away from my fiance. I had health benefits. I was just feeling impulsive. I should have gotten a tiny tattoo on my ankle.
Cool! Here's a little 'way to go' gift from Sabre. [tosses Erin a Frisbee]
[Jim hits a ceiling panel] I don't think he's in the ceiling, babe.
Michael, do not let your imagination run amok.
No, it's horrible!  Jim, she might get arrested.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. No, no, no, no.
Well, if it makes you feel better, I didn't get one either.
Somebody defaced the billboards we just put out in an inappropriate way.
[stopping her] Okay, don't turn this into some feminist issue.
We were hoping you could do something like this���
[walks into a movie theater showing The King's Speech]
Jim does a really good one. Do yours.
How ���bout we wait til next year after you have your kid?
Oh, wow. Seriously? Oh my gosh, is that champagne?
Oscar's pate is great. I could eat it all day, every day. Mmm. How come the good ones are never straight, right?
Dwight, stop. I'm not kidding, I mean, I need you to take care of yourself. What would we do if something happened to you?
What are the odds that this is in any way real?
No. We're gonna make it like a prank. Like order bad food, give her this passive-aggressive card.
[voicemail message for Jim] I'll transfer you.  Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.  Hold, please.  Dunder Mifflin, this is ... okay, sorry.  Michael was standing at my desk, and I needed to be busy or who knows what would've happened, so thank you.
[enters on Michael alone sitting on a bed watching Glee] Michael? Maybe you should try gong in the other room again. You can have my seat. It's closer to the TV. It'll seem louder.
[into phone] Hello, this is Pam Halpert. I���m calling from Dunder-Mifflin. Yes, your paper provider. And I just called to say... your mama is so fat, when she wears red, people yell, ���Hey, kool-aid.��� Yeah, your mama���s fat. This is Pam Halpert.
Sometimes I don't put Michael through until he's already said something. I look at it as a practice run for him. He usually does better on the second attempt.
Here's the thing.  When Michael invents a hypothetical situation, he eventually turns it into an actual situation.
These are my painting clothes.I think I���m gonna do it. I am really gonna start painting the warehouse mural today. [Jim applauds]
Wait a second, I thought you said that you were hurt.
So, um, Michael needs us in the conference room.
Back off, Dwight. [serves] Hyuh! [the opposing team misses the ball, the Scranton team cheers] What?
Jim, what are you doing?  Get in there.  This is not the time to take a stand.  At least he likes one of us.
That's not a real knot. When you pull on it, it disappears.
Oh, hey, don't fill up on chocolates. I made us a lunch reservation at State Street Grill.
Oh, okay, uh, sorry, guys.  Just, um, keep talking.
I thought we were having a nice time.
Yes, and there���s nothing you could say that would get me to run the slightest risk of losing it.
I know, right? What is it? You always look so good in those things.
Yes, let's go. [looks at Erin and nods]
Michael and his jeans.  He gets in them, and I'm not exactly sure what happens.  But I can tell you, he loves the way he looks in those jeans.  I know that's why he started casual Fridays.
Sure, uh, Jan... um, do you know, is anyone coming back to Scranton?
I've decided to show her around. She really wants to meet everybody.
Yes, I have a date. He's a cartoonist for the local paper, which is really neat, because I like to draw too. I'm kind of nervous. I haven't been on a first date in nine years... probably shouldn't broadcast that.
A world where you truly can be anything you want.
I don���t know, but it might take me a long time to figure it out.
Aw, that's so sweet! [dart fires out of box and lodges in ceiling]
You can't fire me, Dwight, just 'cause Michael's not here.
Psst. Jim. [Jim turns around. Pam nods head towards her for him to come over] Um, hey. I need to give you your Christmas gift now because, well, I'll just tell you.
You know what, Dwight? Let me just check the bathroom first. Okay?
You know, like aren't some things just so nice and cozy in the rain?
I think that I should help him get home.
When was the last time you went to the doctor?
[notices Angela's intense concern] Um... let's move on. I volunteer. Did anyone have a problem with me?
Ha ha. That���d be great. Kind of like ditching school, except instead of getting suspended, you get��� What do you get? Oh my god! Why didn���t I think of this? Andy���s not here. Oh, hey, Erin, um, I���m expecting a shipment of pens. Can you cover that?
Yeah. Painting now. I just want to make sure that...
Hey, sorry, I really didn't want to come in. It's just that we have to go buy a new Christmas tree, and we're hoping we could borrow your truck.
Yeah, I distribute so I get all the memos.
I lied it's personal. It's about me and Jim. We're... I just... you're the only person I can talk to.
It's good. But won't it feel weird cutting into a cross?
[Pam and Oscar are trying to repack cardboard box] Yep, yep.
Good. Good. And���[Nellie hits the car against the bushes]
For the past few months I've been sending Dwight letters from the CIA. [hands a folder to Jim]
[to Darryl on phone] Hey, you know that guy Frank who works in the warehouse?
I meant to say something earlier. I just...
I know that it took me a little while to come around and its still a little weird to get used to, but you obviously make my mom very happy.  And that makes me happy.
I won't. It's just that last night is really hard for me to remember because I was just a teensy bit high. Should I have not said that?
Ben Franklin, do you wear boxers, briefs, or pantaloons?
It's just good to stop a Michael train of thought early before it derails and destroys the entire town.
Hey. You have a bunch of messages and... [sees Michael shaking head with beads in hair] that's nice. Hannah quit while you were gone. I guess she memo-ed to file some complaints she had about being a working mother? And so you might also have to be deposed.
[in car] Hey, my aunt told me something neat.
We need everything back the way it was.
I don't know if I'm gonna make any money with art.
Don't act like you understood anything that guy said. [pat's Jim's arm] Good luck, wingman. [salutes]
And also there is no such thing as a rabies doctor.
Hey, Erin. Do you mind faxing this for me?
So this is like, um, an organization station...
Okay. Look at this, look at this. Baby picture.
Nobody's going to prison, okay? Um... all right, Michael, you need to convince Jo to go easy on us. And then we'll all confess once we know our jobs are safe.
I didn't see you! You should have yelled ���Crossing!���
Okay, Dwight, but if you do need a key, just listen it's under the...
We just had to add a few more tables. We weren't expecting this many people.
Well, the last pick-up for overnight deliveries is at seven. So you need to have them signed by then. Or much earlier.
[hands over bag] I didn't, it's from corporate.
[while leafing through Michael's appointment book and seeing nothing but free time] Um, oh boy, let's see, he's really...
Oh, boy. Maybe your heels are too high.
Oh my God. Is that Jan? [points to same monitor]
No, I wouldn���t. I can���t even relate to that impulse. But I bet I could get us a customer complaint. I���d like to try.
Yeah, but there's other, better people out there who are helping.
No.  I don't think I can hit you in the office.
I think we should get a townhouse in SoHo...
Things are a little slow here. And there's only so much cold-calling you can do in a day. Turns out there's no limit to the number of cheese puffs you can throw at someone's face.
Well I don't think you're gonna be very happy with this.
No, I got the teacher introducing them and then the applause afterwards. But not so much of the middle part.
[clink of beer bottles] Beers? You closed it?
[going up to give Dwight a hug] Thanks for much for helping the company, Dwight.
No no no no no! She'll wake up!
Kelly! Um, how are you adjusting to the move?
Yeah, I get to do this like, every week.
[answering the phone] Dunder Mifflin, This is Pam. Oh, I���m sorry. Jim Halpert doesn���t work here anymore.
Once a year they bring in a little cart and they give away free pretzels. It's really not a big deal. To some people it is.
Guess who just got into the Pratt School of Design.
I know you and Dwight have this weird deal, uhm, he sent me out here to see if you could postpone.
Do you want some aspirin, because you seem a little fussy.
Actually, it's kind of too bad we're not coming into work tomorrow.
Oh good, I'm just in time for Ping.
[over loudspeaker, imitating Darth Vader] Luke, this is your father. Come set the table for dinner.
Let's just see how we feel when we get there.
What? Come on guys. We need to figure out who did this and punish them. This isn't just about me. This is about all of us. This is our mural. Don't you see? How much we worked on this? How much time and energy? We put our heart and soul into this thing.
I'm setting Michael up with my land lady. She's really sweet and... whatever, I just can't take Michael like this.
When you're a kid you assume your parents are soul mates. My kids are gonna be right about that. I guess it also means that sometimes love affairs look different to the people inside them. [Andy is in the background, looks incredulous]
[studying mural wall] I guess if I make a mistake, I can just paint over it with a shrub or something. It���s just, I think less of paintings with a lot of shrubs. So, I���m gonna limit myself to one shrub.
Wait, that's it? That's the question you're going to ask him?
Hey, hey, guys. Wait. Before we accept these cupcakes, I think we need to have a conversation privately in the conference room. Don't eat the cupcake.
Well, you��� you bought the house without telling me, so I thought I could sell it without telling you.
Here's a suggestion computer.  I assume you read binary so why don't you zero one one, one one one one, zero one one zero one one.
Next on the list - open the mail.
Okay, I told her you'd talk to her.
No, we um, we had plans for a third, but then I don't know, you never called me back, so...
So. I've been thinking, after we win the lottery, we take our winnings....
So, it really is just about the cupcakes.
Erin, it's not up to you. This computer was for reception! Okay? It's not yours to give away.
Oh you have to Jim? You literally have to?
[asks Nellie who is tapping a pen on her desk]. Is everything okay?
I don���t know, Jim -- maybe you should have been there.
He just so happy to have a family plan.
I have decided that I'm going to be more honest. I'm going to tell people what I want. Directly. So, look out world, cause ol' Pammy is getting what she wants. And, don't call me Pammy.
[mimicing Katy] Oh definitely, definitely step in and out of it like that.
I know, you don't like to be frazzled.
O. [hits the ping-pong ball, and it hits the net] [serves] P.
Umm, Stanley. Maybe you could just unspool a little more each time you need to...
[whispering] I'm so sorry. [Angela, Phyllis, and Pam all whispering] ... seriously, we're just...
Okay. It's been a little more tiring than I thought.
Roy has a connection. It's nicer than you think.
Kevin, you and Stacy set a date yet?
Did I wake up this morning thinking I'd be throwing together a bird funeral?  You never can tell what your day here is  gonna turn into.
Well, we're thinking of my grandmother who we haven't told and is very old-fashioned.
Wouldn't we get fired for smashing all the computers?
So���what do you make of this Robert California guy? I mean, what does a guy like that do on an average weeknight?
Well, um, you can scan it, and then you can upload the image, and then you can copy the new image.
[looking up from her pilfering of Bob's food] What?
I know, but I can't cover reception. I have a ton of work to do.
[over the phone] I just talked to my advisor. Failing.
OK. If I have to do this, based on stereotypes that are totally untrue, that I do not agree with, you would maybe not be  a very good driver.
I know it's wrong to fake going into labor just to get out of things, but sometimes it's necessary.
Oh, my God! It's incredible. [Jim reaches and steals his card back before she can notice it] Is this the Boggle timer?
Okay, well she takes her convictions pretty seriously, she can be kind of severe.
Sure. I mean, it's Philly. I can kill four hours. So uh, yeah. I'll see you at eight.
So, maybe just try one at first, and then if it's okay, have a couple more...
We have good give and take. [vaudeville delivery] I give, he takes.
I forgot what a super, nice girl Katy is. And just... good for Jim! They are so cute together. And, um, what an adorable car.
It's the world's tiniest Bluetooth. I found it in a Japanese gadget store in the village. I got one for Jim, too. Jim, say something.
Because everything makes me cry, so what���s the difference? This dog, he just wants to protect his bone.
It was supposed to be for Meredith, 'cause she said she likes my drawings.
Find someone else, I don���t know. Ask Phyllis.
I'm going to be okay, we should really try to make it until midnight.
Good morning, Mr. Wonka, here are your messages.
[walking in with a tray of six popcorn bags] Popcorn anyone?
Pretty crazy about Andy and Michelle Obama, huh?
It's nice. It's funny. It mentions his tonsillectomy and makes a funny little joke about his moustache.
You know, I really do think it would be worth it to pull over and just take ten minutes to eat.
No, they had to come back for me.
Why aren't there any beans on this very old, frizzy-haired picture of me?
Yeah? [stops laughing] It was though, that's what happened.
Yes, I invested in WUPHF. It's actually a great idea and I can't believe it didn't exist before. And I know Ryan's kind of a sketchy guy, but hey, I married Jim. I've done my part for the nice guy. Now I want a bedroom set.
That's, um... I hadn't thought about it, huh.
...and he said, That's what everyone sees, that's the Man In Black.
Roy gave it to me for Christmas.  I'm trying to figure out how to put songs on it.
[Singing, Pam mumbling lyrics] Closing time, time for you to go home to the places you will be from.
I'm pretty happy these days. I'm getting married soon and I'm getting along with everybody at work.
My veil tore.  I knew when we were getting married and I'm five months pregnant that I'm not going to be able to wear the dress that I always wanted or high heels--
Is there-- um... you want to ease up a little bit?
You talked to the man whose wife you're having an affair with.
Okay, they're almost here- What? Come on. If you guys are gonna be mean, could you at least be subtle? [rips down ugly photo of Nellie]
No, they have been dating for like two years. [Jim in shock] Since before your barbeque.
Can you just tell me now if you're coming or not?
It was a ghost, I told you this on, like, our first date.
Yes. In my top three, so suck it.
What's going on? Do you know that guy?
Michael sends me a postcard from every vacation he goes on. Atlantic City, he wishes I was here. Busch Gardens, Virginia, all I got was this lousy postcard. And this time, I'm Jamaican-him-crazy. I don't know how far away he thought he was, because he put $10 worth of stamps on this.
Here's what I was thinking: everyone sits on a chair every day...
This is the last day of our summer interns. It's been nice. We haven't had interns for a while, ever since Michael's Monica Lewinsky incident. [interns are shown gathered around Kelly's desk, one holding a box of tissues, as Kelly cries and wipes tears] He didn't do anything sexual. [female intern opens a jar of salsa for Michael] He just made far, far too many Monica Lewinsky jokes. [Meredith rubs her breasts into Maurie's back] It was just easier for corporate to shut down the program.
Jim and I went to dinner a few times when he got back from New York. I talked him through his break up. It's really nice to be good friends again.
Michael, do you need me to call an ambulance?!
Angela, you have to put a stop to this right now.
[taking Michael's picture] Okay, a little bit more closer to the sign. Yeah.
So, not the ring then? The- the- Not doing the ring?
I have this little vacuum cleaner that's broken.  If Dwight doesn't work out, maybe that could be manager.
Oh, um, it's just, I didn't, I didn't have a lot of time, so that's just a place holder.
We discuss... [Angela and Phyllis giggle] the idea of doing the party totally normal. Like, not mean. Just a regular party. [giggling stops] Not mean.
Oh, and if he makes a joke, just laugh it up, no matter what. Okay?
I thought we were just having fun at the beach.
[long pause] And of course, if there's ever anything I can ever do for you...
I'm kind of in-between boyfriends right now. So I don't need anything sexy. But I do need some new hand towels. I figure I can cut up this robe.
No, just do one. Two question marks is kind of aggressive. You know it's like wha-what?? Just do one.
Oh, no everything's great! Um, I was just calling to see how the meeting went.
I dunno. I mean, maybe he'll talk to you about some of this stuff 'cause he can't really talk to me about it.
[Ryan and Kelly make out in the nook] But she's had a bad influence. She's like an addict. [Ryan and Kelly argue] And I just had to get her clean.
And, poof! He disappears. [Jim snaps, playing along]
Yeah, the bride doesn't really do... Have you ever been to a wedding?
Oh, awesome.  You're a life saver.  [drinks from coffee cup] Wait, is this just milk and sugar?
[voicemail message for Jim] Hey, I have a chance to sneak out of here early, and I'm not messing this up, so I'll see you tomorrow.
Mom, have you decided what you want to be called?
Hey, well, good morning.  I think I have good news for you today.  I found your new executive assistant.  My friend Carla.  [looking at resume]  She's got great experience.  We even considered making her Cece's godmother, but she had this boyfriend at the time-- but here's her resume.
Oh, I know.  We talked about it and he told me.
Am I being mean to Dwight? I don't know. I did just make him run around the building and I have no intention of timing him. This isn't even a stopwatch. It's a digital thermometer. He does make my life harder, sometimes. And on purpose. Like he tried to put meters on the bathroom stalls as a way of bringing in more money for the company. [yells to Dwight] Hey, three more laps to go. Gotta pick it up if you're going to beat Toby.
Oscar said WUPHF only has enough money for nine days.
Oh I don't care, I didn't really like that place that much anyway. I'll just move.
I have never, ever dated, or wanted to do anything resembling dating Michael, ever. Not ever, not now, not then, not now, not ever, ever.
Good. Doesn't sound pushy...you're just stating a fact.
Tomorrow I start a three-month design program at the Pratt Institute in New York. I will be a little fish in the big apple. [does hand gesture] What up, 212?
[putting mayo on Creed's head] Creed, I'm all done. My turn.
Awesome! I'll leave it up here so everyone can enjoy it.
She has a boyfriend. He's out of town.
Yes, Jim���s friend is starting anew company based on this idea Jim had when they were back in college.
I think she looks good. Now that she���s wearing sports bras, we don���t see her boobs as much.
Say they don���t hire you. It���s not like you���re out on the street. You have a great job with people who love you.
I think it's interesting how Forster uses Italy to represent sexuality and passion. [Kevin dumping change in the snack machine] And that also brought up themes of, uh, you know, fate and coincidence.  And Lucy's torn between these two things.  She's torn between passion and convention.
This could be real. Dwight's pretty handy with computers. He fixed my laptop once.
Dunder Mifflin this is Pam. Oh, hey Mom. No, what did Dad say?
I'm so sorry, Rolando told me everything.  How humiliating.  Would it help you to return to another age?  A time of refinement, and civility.
Why did you put it off until Halloween?
The day's going fine. It's been a little chaotic but it's fine. It's great! A lot of distractions. But, it's good.
Dreams are just that. They're dreams. They help get you through the day. Like the thing about the terrace. It's nice but... um... I don't know. It was just something I read in this book when I was twelve. The girl in the book has a terrace outside of her bedroom and she planted flowers on it and I just loved that. Just always kind of stuck with me.
Yeah, we walk around, everyone sees our faces and we leave, right?
When Jim decided to come back to Scranton full-time, I was relieved, but I also feel a little guilty. I mean, he���s giving up this big thing for me. But he seems happy. I mean, he���s certainly been goofing around a lot. I love goofy Jim.
You can buy new stuff but you can't buy a new party.
Oh! I'm going into labor! Oh my goodness!
[on phone with Jim] He said, 'I did like Dwight'? He's gonna fire him.
[everyone yelling at Pam]You guys, I am so sorry! It's just been so chaotic with Jim gone, that...
I just feel kind of tired, you know.
Will you just, will you grab Clark real quick?
Wait. Can you back up? What's the story?
I haven't heard anything, but I bet Jim got the job.  I mean, why wouldn't he?  He's totally qualified, and smart, everyone loves him... and, if he never comes back again... that's OK.  We're friends.  And I'm sure we'll stay friends.  We just, we never got the timing right.  You know?  I shot him down, and then he did the same to me, and...  But you know what?  It's OK.  I'm totally fine.  Everything is gonna be totally--- [Jim walks in]
[pointing to Jim's bluetooth headset] What's that? Is that a-
I can't do this. I don't have this sales gene, or whatever it is. Tell me everything is going to be ok.
Roy, I picked those flowers. Phyllis just stole all of my ideas for our wedding.
[To camera] I don't care what they say, I just want to eat. Which I realize is a lot to ask for... at a dinner party.
I spent 10 years as a receptionist, to Michael Scott. And I have kids now. And I just, I can't.
Nope, and we're gonna need a loaves and fishes kind of miracle to feed 'em all.
Yes! Oh! [runs into his arms, kisses him] Um, congratulations to you, sir. [they shake hands business-like]
I've heard that. [reaches down to pick up bagel from the floor]
Here's the story. That guy in there is Jim's childhood friend, Tom.
Dwight. [to Troy] Michael will be out in a second.
You'll be Mr. Christmas by the end of the night.
There's an HR meeting in there at 11:30.
...I feel like we should go get Kevin something. Do you think we can sneak out of here?
Hey, Angela. I got good news today too. I won an art contest.
I know we're having that harassment thing this afternoon.
Not anymore.  It's, um... It's completely over now.
She doesn't want you to return the barrette. She's not interested in you.
Cute. [enters office area] Very funny, everyone. Who wrote captions under my doodle? I'm not even kidding. They're pretty good.
Do you mind if I go out for a drink with these guys?
I'm taking a computer animation class so I could try to do a logo.
Well, I am a few months ahead of you.
I got Erin a new computer, because the one at reception sucked. I should know. And I don't wanna say the other one was old, but its I.P. number is one! [laughs sheepishly] Right?
Right? Thank you! It���s just Philly. Everyone���s acting like it���s New York or Paris or London.
Roy was supposed to pick the band, but he's concentrating more on the bachelor party now.
No, uh, me Stanley and Phyllis so far.
Andy, did I dream that you were crying through the night?
And then, remember, we went shopping the next day to buy me a washer and dryer?
And that was fun. But what about a year from now?
Well, he could still... I'm sorry about that... Oh could I just get you to sign this second page.
Oh, I have more. [Holds up bags of candy]
Ok, for the record, I am pregnant and, obviously there has been some kind of a mistake, so why doesn't Jim just pick the next highest score on the list and we'll move on.
Uh, to speak my truth, I'd appreciate if you hung that up cause we were in the middle of a conversation. [Jim hangs up phone] I appreciate the sacrifice.
He's really making you work for it, huh?
Yes! They're the only two gay guys I know. But they should be together.
I've talked to Meredith, Stanley and Jim about the chairs. I know they're with me on this.
I feel like [Pam look's out the window and camera pans out in The Office]--Dwight is holding a candle and reading a poem.
I'm sorry too.  I just, I think that we both made some bad choices.
Okay. Sorry. We'll uh, we'll leave you alone.
Okay. [picks up and reads sheet]  The Michael Scott Foundation is still in existence?
I haven���t told anyone here about the mural yet. I want Jim to be the first to know. Whenever I tell him good news, he���s always like, ���Beesly!��� I love that. Only thing better than getting the job-- ���Beesly!��� [chuckles]
Well, I though we were saving money for the wedding, but apparently Roy thought it was more important to buy two WaveRunners. I don't really ever get to use the other WaveRunner that's supposed to be mine because his brother uses it and they race.
Different colored paint. I wanted different colored paint in the spots where they put their paint. So, it just is... OK, the point is, these warehouse guys are vandals. And, they need to be stopped.
I'm gonna need the name and cell phone number of the housekeeper responsible for changing the sheets, please.
[ascends on lift, using megaphone] Attention, everyone. Can I have your attention, please? Yeah, I don't know everybody's name down here, but whoever did this will you please raise your hand. [no one replies] Hello? This is not over. OK? I will stay up here all day if I have to. Is that what you want? [descends on lift] Yeah, I will also come down if I want to. It's my choice.
You guys, I don't think any of us are really qualified to be giving Holly personal advice about her love life.
Hey, Michael, why don't you just get down.
Anyone want to see the video from Cece���s recital?
If I get you a slice of pizza, are we even?
He's not coming out. He won't pick up the phone.
Angela, I want to talk to you about something.
But it's free. And we'll keep our eye on them.
Yes! Because with all of your support, by this time next year maybe I'll be down to one glass of iced tea a week.
Hey, uh, any volunteers to come with me to go buy a Christmas tree?
[on phone] Hey, uh, give me a call back when you get a chance. Cece did great, and I want to tell you something.
Oh, great. Oh, I���m sorry. Do you mind telling me her name? I realized we don���t have it.
See all this like old stuff, like um, there's that shot of Jim and I up on the roof?
No.  I read in the book about nipple confusion.
I don't know, I think I was just staring at my desk.
Please? Just make sure he's OK? [Jim climbs through hatch]
Look at her. Even I want some fries with that shake.
You can't, I locked the office from the inside when we left.
Yeah, it turns out I was, um, just grasping at straws.
So, uh, biggest thing, besides not being able to get her to latch...
You know what? I'm sick of this! Let's go, you and me!
[hesitating at the bribe] Yeah. You know what , I think I saw ONE sick day down there.
Yes, he bowled 5 frames with this pink sparkly thing until a little girl had to ask for her ball back.
I don't think you should go to Philly tonight. I think that you should stay and I think we should fight.
Oh, no. I took a phone call in the middle of taping, and then when I went to turn it back on, I must have turned it off.
Actually, people are really unhappy. Um, Dwight sent around this memo and people are freaking out 'cause the...
Okay. So I went on the Internet, and she is not gonna find another apartment for that price. I mean this one is twice as much, and it doesn't have parking. Does she like to park?
Just let him flirt with her. People meet each other all sorts of ways.
Whatever, you know, sleep with my mom, sleep with everybody's mom...
You know, stuff people didn't intend for everyone to see. And they kinda want to know how much.
Well, since we're stopped at a light, uhhh, here is...the mural I did for Angela's baby.
Hmm... yeah.  Listen Michael.  Have you really thought this through?  'Cause it's a pretty big risk.
No, I mean he's sulking. That's not like him.
Hm. I'm looking forward to getting to know you better, Vikram.
Unless he has a secret costume that he told everyone about except for me.
People treat us like the race on our forehead. And then we guess what race we are.
Listen our credit card has been cancelled and we have to deal with that, and I really can't handle the fact that you're calling us here!
And I have my original. [holds up original paper, ripped in half]
I just want to say, that this was the best, Dundies, ever! WHOOOOOOOOO!!!
Michael, it's time for the suggestion box meeting.
Not one of them called to congratulate me on our engagement.
Because I'm never gonna act like that, even in your fantasy.
Oh, I love Chuck Close and his photo-realist paintings. But I have to work.
Well the breadsticks are like what then, Ryan, what can I use?
Just like no big reason. Just a bunch of little reasons.
I think... I mean, I don't know what it is but...
I hate the idea that someone out there hates me. I even hate thinking that Al-Qaeda hates me. I think if they got to know me, they wouldn't hate me. But Karen knows me, and she still hates me, so...
Our party is also starting now [opens door to break room.]
Oh I will. I will Kevin. I will make that my top priority.
But have you ever actually seen him yourself?
You had a nice meal with your girlfriend in a lovely place...
[looks at beers] Oh. [Starts to walk away, turns around] No. Actually, one of these is supposed to be a lite.
[Pam���s phone vibrates] Oh, text from Jim. ���This is getting very weird. Will explain later.���
Okay. [walks to conference room with Andy and stares at the sign up sheet with wonder] When did people sign-
Oh come on. You really think I'm gonna have a fourteen pound baby?
This is not enough for you and I���m afraid that I���m not enough for you.
Darryl, oh, my gosh. How is Austin? Tell me everything. How���s the merger? I feel like I read about Athlead all the time.
Weird to see how we used to look in those promos. Some of us have changed so much.
Hey, here's your schedule for next week. Are you okay?
Well the first one has a surprise factor. 'I'm a suck suck-suckidy Sabre!'
I was just going to go down to the hotel bar for a little bit.
Um, there was an amazing buffet and there was a chocolate fondue... station. And what else was there?
Really, you can���t be scared of a room full of Jims. I love the guy, but he���s basically Gumby with hair. [Darryl laughs]
No, I know, like, I kind of like, I thought that maybe you did when I first started.
[looks up] Why aren't you as mad or interested in this as me?
If you would have asked me that, then you would know.
You know Michael's been talking to her too.
So one afternoon, while walking home from school, quirky 10th grader Becky Walters finds a wounded Pegasus in the woods.  And she becomes...The Horse Flyer.
Do you want me to ask the cleaning crew if they stopped watering it?
What's going on, why do you have a second job?
Don't you think it's better to tell him the truth now? You know, rather than waste more of his time?
What? What is it? What? What is, oh, my God! [Jim starts attacking snowmen] Honey? Jim? Jim!
Oh, I'm kind of in the middle of -- yes please.
Okay, alright, thanks...  Okay, do you want to eat?  You want to try eating?  Okay...  Okay, let me...  Just you and me.  Come on.  There we go...  Yeah...  Oh, yeah.  Like that.  There we go.  You got it.
I am going to tell her, but now is clearly not the time.  I will buy her a wig, we'll have a few laughs. There's a right way to do this.
Oh! I... uh... yeah. Um... I'll uh show them to you later.
That's not bad. Hey, do you do weddings?
Why don't you just tell him how his actions are being perceived by the women in this office?
Yes, this is the only time I'm ever going to make this request.
Well, I���m heading out to Cece���s dance recital.
Sometimes there's a lot of time between the calls.
Yeah, whatever. [Jim holds up the card] [Pam laughs] Give it to me. Give it to me.
You remember you fired Roy for attacking Jim and I don't talk to him anymore really.
[placing a coke can in front of Jim] Here. [Jim looks confused] Just buy it from me. I haven't talked to you in hours and it's been weird and I really want to know what the hell's going on with Dwight. [Pam scoots the coke can towards Jim.  Jim pulls out his wallet and hands Pam a dollar.  He gives the coke back to Pam]
Oh my God, Meredith what are you doing!?
Yeah. Um, do you have any other pictures of Astrid?
No, no, that guy who hit on me.
Michael, Michael, wait we don't have, we don't have the budget for another party.
On average, how many hours a day do you spend naked in your office? Just ballpark.
So, you know it means I have to go to New York for three months...
I���m training a temp to be my replacement while I���m on maternity leave. Oh I should���ve mentioned I���m pregnant. You probably didn���t notice because it���s impossible to tell I���m so small. But yeah I���m pregnant. [another squeak] Oh come on!
Sorry. Um, David is in Vermont. Did you speak with him? He sent Dwight instead.
[pours something from the fridge into a bowl and opens the microwave, it is covered in exploded food] Oh, come on! [to the documentary crew] Do you see this?  Disgusting.
I finished my laundry.  Got all my socks.  Nothing like that time that crazy guy pushed you.
So the sports marketing business that Jim told everyone about except for me?
This is our first and only Valentine's Day as fiances.
No, but that would've been a really good idea.
You know the baby's not going to live here, right?
Honestly, I think you should go easy on her.
Maybe. But it sounds like you're just wrong for each other.
[knocking on Angela's car window, Angela is naked inside] Hey in there. It's Pam. It's not Dwight! Don't think it's Dwight!
I feel horrible for blowing Jim's prank. I don't know if you can tell, but he's mildly upset. And Dwight hasn't been messed with in a while, so he's become a monster. I need to make this right.
Hey honey, I don't think we should push him.
[on the phone] Hey, hey! Where are you?  Can you take Andy to the hospital?
It's really hard to demonstrate depression.  Their safety training had visuals.
Okay. You know the test booklets that they give out in all the schools. I was thinking that we could put a coupon in the back that people would mail in to us... and as, you know, as I tell it, I don't like it. Unless, of course, you are responding to it.
Oh, yeah. Uh, I think I remember that from back from when I first started.
I know a lot of us have been feeling under the weather lately. It's that time of year. And according to a study done by the University of Arizona, they've discovered that your keyboards have hundreds of times more bacteria, per square inch, than a toilet seat.
He didn't leave me. He just went part time. [Meredith scratches her head vigorously] Can you just fill out the form please?
[on phone] No, he hasn't picked one yet.
But, ah, I suppose the second one is the better written line.
You think your doctor's going to give you a C-section at six months?
Ryan invited some of the branch managers and Toby into the woods for a 'get to know you' weekend. Michael wasn't invited. Apparently they already knew everything they needed to know about him.
What could he possibly stand to gain from a real juggling routine?  How can you keep defending him?
Movie Monday started with training videos, but we went through those pretty fast.  Then we watched a medical video.  Since then, it's been half hour installments of various movies, with the exception of an episode of Entourage, which Michael made us watch six times.
Nothing, it's just I had to sit here all day, while Phyllis got like an entire garden delivered to her.
I can't believe this. I mean I have never even stolen as much as a paperclip and you're firing me.
I know how to operate my phone, okay? Listen, we���re getting close. We will talk to you later. Say, ���Bye, Daddy.���
Yeah, if I could have seen what he just did, I think I would have gotten angry.
I know. But we should go. We need to thank him for, you know, saving my life.
I traded with Dwight. Just, I figured, you know, you went to a lot of trouble and it means a lot. And also, Roy got me an iPod or was going to get me an iPod, so ..
Michael... you shouldn't be with someone who doesn't make you happy.
This was a terrible relationship. You were not happy when you were with her.
I'm serious. Um, I'm really glad I came.
Yes! I'm in a good mood today! I'm excited to meet all the new people and to see my old friend again, definitely. That's always a thing that makes people happy... to have an old friend back.
You guys, if I knew you wanted to do a caption contest, I would have drawn something more challenging.
If I could get her sleeping normally I could get my life back.
I really don't want to talk about it.  I don't mean to be rude, but I just... I don't want to comment on what happened.  It
You know, Jim���s kind of nervous about it, but I think it could really help.
[holds up single sheet of paper] Um, that's all we brought.
Hey, let's focus today. Make today all about focus. I'll help you.
[on phone] Yes, I understand.  Can I transfer you to customer relations?
Right here. Little Michael Scott- [points to her belly]
[knocking on door to Deangelo's office as loud yelling comes from inside it] Hey!  It sounds like you guys are having a lot of fun, but it's really loud, and some of us are trying to work, so do you think you could do it a little more quietly?
It would've been just as easy for him to spell insect. Of course, that wouldn't have made any sense either.
No, no, I want my mom and dad to be there.
I think it's gonna put a damper on the party a little.
New York, as it turns out, is very expensive, and I ran out of money. I thought about selling a kidney, but Michael offered to get me a part-time job at corporate.
Hey, I���m the one who has to sit next to this weirdo when Jim���s away. I���m in a position where I���m rooting for Nate, and that just feels wrong. [sighs] Forget it.  I need to work on my mural. I have some pointy trees that I need to round off.
I have a ton of stuff to do for the wedding. And I have to do it in the office. And that can be kind of awkward. Um... just because people can get all weird about wedding stuff. Then... I just... I don't want to offend... Angela... or someone.
[in New York] That's what she said! That's what she said! That's what she said!
Yeah, I'd love to see them. Oh, and tell them I say, 'Congratulations.'
Is Jim gonna propose tonight? He is, isn't he? No, he's not... Is he?
But the warehouse coffee tastes SO much better.
Yeah. He said that you told him how much you love me. About how you feel when I walk in a room, and about how, you've never doubted for a second that I'm the woman you want to spend the rest of your life with. I guess he's never felt that with my mom, even at their best.
At least she lived a very long and I'm sure, a very happy life. Got you this card. When you're ready. We all signed it. We just wanted you to know we're thinking about you.
I didn't tell you about the crying because I didn't want you to know how upset I was. Because it would've stressed you out and you're always saying how much you don't want more stress.
Oh, cause it was upside down. [both laugh]
Well, that���s funny because I think of him as working part time in Philadelphia.
They came up with that idea really fast.
Oh, my God.  His letter of recommendation from Rick Santorum is three fifty-dollar bills.
[faxing, Erin watching over her shoulder] What are you doing?
No, I'm sure they're pretty much the same as the English instructions.
No! No, I���m interested. I mean I think everybody���s interested in why they have to sing it.
We can't help you if you don't just tell us what happened.
I don't know! [Mose starts running by the left side of the car]
He said if it takes off he���s gonna buy us a new car.
Like the main company number? Because I'm gonna have to call information.
Jada, Darryl, I'm so glad I found you guys. A grinch stole the star from on top of the Christmas tree and is hiding it in the warehouse somewhere. You want to go help me find him?
At this point, when you're this pregnant, it's kind of like senior spring. The other day I spit my gum out on the carpet.
Read article nineteen. There are suitable standards that you have to maintain the building at that includes comfortable temperatures and adequate lighting. It also means no more cutting the tampons in two, and no more tampering with the toilet paper.
Hey, Cece, Daddy���s gonna have dinner with us tonight after he comes to your recital. Are you excited?
[on phone] Look, I'm not going to tell you that we have lower prices. Is price something that is important to you? Ok, well let me know if anything changes.
Hey, everybody. Um, I decided to eat my cupcake. I thought about it last night. I talked to Jim. I talked to my sister. And, I think that, as long as Todd Packer doesn't know, it's OK.
Well... I always dreamed of a house with a terrace upstairs. Plant flowers on it... stuff like that. Since I was a girl. Um... More seriously though, a husband that I love... Roy. And I love to draw. And I... I did a little in college and I'd still love to do something where I could work with art or graphic design in some way.
It's OK. You know what they say, a change is as good as a rest.
Oh, okay. It���s just that���s how Cece does it with the backwards ���E���s.
Oh, don't get us wrong, we like picnics.
Uh, we brought back some Puerto Rican candy.
Yes, of course, we could've just been doing this the whole time, but SOMEONE dropped the ball.
[Pam and Jim hear Dwight crying] Ugh, your turn.
Dwight mercy killed Angela's cat.  It's very complicated.  It's caused a lot of unpleasantness between Dwight and Angela.  Who are both already prone to unpleasantness.
Usually the day we talk about sexual harassment is the day that everyone harasses me as a joke.
Because you love her?  [baby voice]  Because you love her very much?
This could all go away if you just tell me the truth.
Okay, well I have the tablecloth, don't forget the flatware.
Michael just rented The Devil Wears Prada. He has his NetFlix sent here to the office, and he watches them in pieces when things are slow.
Well a giant check costs about $200.00 to make up. I have a print shop standing by but... What do you think Michael, that's over 25% of our funds?
[to everyone in conference room] I have terrible news. Someone defaced my mural. They painted all over it.
Oh, no. Um, I, I'm embarrassed. It's stupid.
Is that what he tells you at your little inner circle meetings?
I'm kidding around.  We joke about that stuff all the time.  I'm not really the jealous type, so, I don't care if Jim sees Karen.  I care a little.
Are you sure you don't want to play?
Oh, thanks. My Mom made it for me.
Why? Does he think you're going to Florida?
I mean, help, if it's something simple, like add page numbers or laminate it or...
Oh, thank you. I acknowledge and appreciate that you went out of your way to get me tea.
[on the phone with a client] I just wanted to check and see if there's anything you needed before I went on my maternity leave...  Yeah, I'm pregnant...  Great, well, I'll write up the order.  Okay, thanks.
I should just go.  [accent]  Where to now Caleb?
You are going to text me, the morning of my wedding.
[embarrassed] Yes, thank you. [finishes banana and hands server the peel]
Wait! What you should do, Michael, is have a doctor take a look at it. Because we really don't know what that is.
Lord of the Ring stuff? I don't know, I'm just trying to think of things that were happening at the time.
Fair enough. Um... I don't think you're a very good person. And forgive me, but I feel like I've said this to you before: I don't like you very much.
I... listen, umm, we're still good for this weekend, right?
[in Jim's ear] I wonder what else Dwight's been right about....
Well, you shouldn���t be nervous about this. This is a tiny start-up with a bunch of guys just as dorky as Jim.
So you have an office and a workspace?
Oh. That was like crazy. 'Cause I was...
Um, well, I could come back as a salesman. I have experience now.
Today's a 'women in the workplace' thing. Jan's coming in from Corporate to talk to all the women about... um... I don't really know what. But Michael's not allowed in. She said that about five times.
[reading flavors] Despera-dough. Witchy-womanilla. Why do they do this?
[pointing to staff members] Blazer. Freckles. Penguin. K.D. Lang. Holly's boyfriend. These mnemonic devices help to make a connection, and then, also to help you memorize names. I have a chainsaw! [holds up chainsaw, makes a wimpy chain saw noise] Cutting down the competition.
Hi. Wow, I really thought I'd be more excited to be here.
Ceramics class. Then dinner by myself. I'm gonna watch HGTV and maybe go to Bungalow 8 with John Mayer.
Oh, yeah, this is the part where Kevin sat in front of the camcorder all night. It's great.
Ok fine I���ll draw him. [hangs up phone and draws]
Michael, you shouldn't do anything that you're uncomfortable with.
Would any of you be saying any of this if the cupcakes were from Supermart?
[gesturing to Michael dancing in his office] He looks happy.
Yeah, but in a jokey way where you're gonna start singing.
I don't know what to do! Do I go tell Jo, or - I don't want everyone to keep blaming the wrong person!
You know, maybe there's an opportunity for a joke there, like, um... like, [vaudeville delivery] 'I just delivered a baby. They didn't offer me a guarantee.'
Please stop saying what.  Can you take him?
Dwight, no gun, okay? Don't make us call Jo.
Angela insisted that all the animals be fully clothed.
Ok. I, just, when you are done or any time it's convent, I just thought since you are out...
I'm looking forward to 'Take Your Daughter to Work' day. I am not great with kids, but I wanna get better. Because I'm getting married. So, I put out a bunch of extra candy out on my desk so the kids will come talk to me. ...Like the witch in Hanzel and Gretel.
Oh, thank you! I don't know why I doubted it, because I'm so clearly awesome!
[On phone] About 10 minutes ago. No, I didn't know what to say.  Yes, I know.  Um, I don't know, mom, he's my best friend.  Yeah, he's great.  Yeah, I think I am. [Jim enters] I have to go. I will. Listen, Jim... [They kiss]
Well, my dad can't hear a thing. You could boom his whole life for him.
How about, Angela can keep it up on Tuesdays and Thursdays?
Nellie's pretty fearless. And I think she might be maybe even almost sort of fun.
Like, he used to make dogs fight? Or he actually fought dogs?
Some of us like the walk more than others.
Oh, yeah! We have such a solid foundation, you know.
I mean, we���ve having issues. It can���t hurt to talk about them, right?
Hi, um. I'm sorry, do you have a minute? Is this a bad time?
You can't be a part of our relationship, Michael.
[to an off camera waiter and still clutching Jim's beer] Can I get a drink?
I don't want to have my baby here.
[in Jim's ear] Ask how he's doing since the breakup.
You know, Michael. When I feel overwhelmed -
When did you find time to do all this?
Jim, I got us that dinner reservation. Grico���s at 7:30.
Well, as I am sure you know, for the past few months, I've been the Office Administrator. Since right before you guys took over.
So ok. I'm watching the movie, by myself...
That's OK. I don't feel like answering phones.
Okay. I lost my engagement ring in ceramics class. Left it in my smock. I had this whole thing where I go back to class, wrongly accuse another girl. Look I even used makeup to put a ring around my finger, you can hardly see it, it's very subtle.
One, and then wrap around.  It's okay.  Hold that arm down.
[Pam nods head] You should say hi. Use her full name.
I don't know I'm really committed to winning.
No, not... we're not... we're not having problems. But it is personal. And I would love...
Dunder Mifflin this is Pam. Uh, I'm sorry, Michael's not here right now can I take a message? Great. I will. Thanks.
Yeah, well, you know, whatever happens. [Kelly puts her hand on Pam's shoulder] Oh.
No, I mean, just 'cause we like got along so well.
Jim is great. Being with him just takes away all the stress of planning my wedding.
I have Ben Nugent on the line, he is the top salesman in Utica.
Roy's right. There's no guarantee it's going to lead to anything anyway.
Oh, thank God.  I haven't had caffeine in nine months.
Uh, no, I um. Everything's pretty much the same here.
I have the worst attitude of any person here.
You know what? It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.
Great! I thought you could use this time to authorize some checks.
It all started when Dwight was tapping his foot against the leg of his desk. When I asked him to stop, he said, 'I will when you lose the baby weight.'
[Michael sits alone eating at the back of the kitchen, Pam comes in with Jim, Creed and Kevin] You should do more stuff like that.
Is it? I just, I liked our life in Scranton.
And don't say that thing about how lots of gay guys have kids.
And when they were both in the third grade, Jim was placed in the top reading group.
Oh, thank you.  Is that um, I can't tell if I'm really producing.  I don't know if she's getting anything.
Yeah. I have my copies. [holds up messed up copies]
She's coming in today and maybe just don't joke around about that stuff in front of her.
Okay, I get it. [Michael laughs] Why are you giggling?  Is this a joke?  [Michael continues to laugh] Michael, is this-- did I get the job?
No, really, it's okay. I know that Jim had, like a crush on me when he first started. But that was a long time ago, so.
Actually Andy, I think maybe we experienced it.
I'm not apologizing to anyone.  Michael owes me an apology.
[in conference room with the party planning committee] So Michael said we can do whatever we want cake-wise. What do we want?
No, no, no, it's fine. I was just commenting. We gotta get these out, open 'em up.
That sucked. He didn't apologize. There's no talking to that guy.
Down.  You have to sit down so I can get the full effect.
I went on a date. It wasn't a love connection, um... I think when I like someone again, I'll just kinda know.
Hey!  [gets up to greet Helene] Hey. Happy birthday.
Although, like, unlikely things happen all the time. My best friend, in High School, she went to Australia, Canberra I think, and she met this guy who lived only two streets away in America.
I can't hear anything, there's like, there's like machines going-
So my corner's the one with the copier?
Not that I call myself an impressionist, per se.
Can you believe my boss proposed to his girlfriend in public? That is so Michael.
Yeah, I wanted to show you something in the lobby. Come on.
Wait, when am I...? You just have to be clear and firm. You know, just tell him you don't love him. Just be honest with him. [Erin nods]
That's a very rude thing to say, Kevin.
I feel bad about what I wrote on the bathroom wall.
You might want to trim it a little.
Do you think that you could send in your RSVP card?
OK. What does he like? What's important to him? Does he have like a favorite pair of boots or a lunch box or...
Okay, you guys, have fun. You too, Andy.
As soon as they leave, well get Kelly and start.
Ryan, you should be more sensitive. It's obvious she likes you and comments like that, they just...
I am not going to let Kelly throw her life away on Ryan. And it has nothing to do with access to my pediatrician. Why you would even ask or were going to ask, because I- I felt like that question was coming.
Dunder Mifflin is having our first own garage sale. Like many Americans, we realized we had a lot of things that we really didn't need. And 10 cents of every dollar is going into the party fund so we can throw parties for ourselves.
You know what? I-- I-- I don���t think you want to start a conversation with me about what���s fair. Okay? This is way more intense than I ever --
Really? Oh, my gosh! We just have the one, but she poops for four. [laughs]
Michael started the process of selecting a new chair about three weeks ago. And normally I wouldn't care, but he promised me his old one. It's way better. It's one of these. [makes a shrrhhh sound of a chair moving downward as Pam slumps down] I really want it.
And looks so handsome in his UNIFORM! Please?
Um, Jim, please, please, please, I think it'd be weird if you did it.
Oh, bodes well for the post-conference room meeting.
You just have to go in there. You have to hear it from her.
[sighs] Oh, I���m sorry. I feel like you���ve already been working insanely hard.
Well I think they'll get the spirit of it.
Amok. It means, don't let your imagination run out of control.
You're- You know your assistant told me that you have a big pitch meeting today. With Ryan Howard. How did that happen?
There's nothing better than a beautiful day at the beach, filled with sun, surf, and uh... diligent note-taking. [holds up notes]
Michael, he means the Wall Street Journal online.
A dozen different pies? Cause that means rhubarb.
[recorded on phone] Excuse me, I have to get back to work.
[goes to punch Michael; he flinches] You have to keep your hands down, Michael.
No, I know that you���re, like, happy and, like, you had fun today.
I���m afraid that you���re gonna resent me and I���m afraid that���
Cece, is reverse cycling, which means she sleeps all day and is up all night. Which basically means I'm up all day and I'm up all night. And if it doesn't stop soon, I am going to be up all night.
it���s okay. You can sit in the annex.
He's a big Meryl Streep fan, so I shouldn't be surprised that he's identified with her character.
Hey!  Jim! Um, listen, can I call you back in a little bit?  I made friends!
[in Meredith's van] I have never seen so many parking tickets.
And that's what you said about Art School, and that's what you said about sales.
Are you going to Angela's cat party on Sunday?
Yeah. I���m afraid he���s only gonna have hot dogs.
Here, uh... Meredith? Why don't you put your hazards on.
[lifting up a diamond bracelet] Oh, my God.
Why would you want to raise your cholesterol?
Thank you! Thank you. I got it. Now I know. You thought I was a little dorky. You know? [gibberish sounds] Okay. Well, excuuuuse me.
Oh, okay, Michael, slow down. Everything's gonna be okay.
It's nice having Katy around. It's another person for Michael to um, interact with.
No, I mean, you're doing great, and Andy put you in charge of the whole party, right?
Well, we won���t be late. I love you, mom. Thanks.
Why don't you use the microwave in the kitchen, Phyllis?
So someone is going to a court. Big deal.
I'm sure she's just confused. People scratch their heads when they're confused. Not always like an ape, the way Meredith just did, but it happens.
Really unlikely. But I can't say that it's impossible.
No, the doctor said every five to seven minutes.
[Michael walks in dressed as Willy Wonka] Good morning, Michael.
Okay.  So... you would be the Regional Manager,
There is nothing dishonorable about talking about your life.  People like it.
Yes. But, what I didn't tell you is that I actually bought the tickets. We only didn't go because it was-
If we check in after midnight, I get an extra day to recuperate surrounded by doctors.
Yeah, that's right.  We could do a three-day weekend.  I wonder if I could, like, call in sick on the Friday.  Then I get a four-day weekend.
Don't take this the wrong way, but... you should go for that job.
But that's okay. Because it's not about being perfect, it's about trying.  In fact, why don't we go around and confess some of the ways that we've fudged on some of our resolutions?
Okay, it's not regulation size, but it'll do. You have to practice. You have to get real good and beat Darryl.
0-1-7-5. Thank you. Bye, bye. [to Michael] It really makes us look unprofessional.
Uh, could we come in too? Just for some water.
Let me make something clear. Jim and I have never and will never have sex in the office.
[to Phyllis] Can you tell us what happened?
Yeah, I think we should get him to the hospital.
Roy's my fiance. We've been engaged about three years. We were supposed to get married in September but I think we're gonna get married in the spring.
Angela - she used to stay here sometimes?
I was just wondering, what kind of jobs do you guys have?
Ahh!  I'm sorry, I didn't, I didn't see you come in.
I don't know how the whole betting thing started, but it's fun.
Okay, so, when you���re selling to this woman, just imagine that she���s that nice, reasonable barber.
What does that even mean? Where would your name appear?
That's as specific as I'd like to be.
Yeah, its nuts. But I don't know what else to do.
Thank you. Really you guys thank you. Very sweet.
The warehouse got a ping pong table last week. Now Jim comes down and plays with Darryl. Sometimes I bring him juice. My boyfriend is 12.
Hmm. I think Jim���s lying to me about not being attracted to Cathy.
Yeah, he's, uh, pretty good, huh? [to Roy] Let's get you into a tub.
[pointing to the window in Michael's office] Oh, Michael marked his heights. He's grown!
OK Michael, you know what? I might have someone for you.
Remember, you were gonna get a new chair, and you were gonna give your old chair to me. Remember that?
It���s going to be good to have someone hot at Pam���s desk huh?
Great. Uh, except, I don't want to be a receptionist anymore.
Is it... is it pebbles from that beach in Jamaica? [she shakes it]
No. I mean, I don't know, I don't think so.
Okay, I know I���ve been crying easily today, but- [shows unfolded paper Jim dropped, shows two lists, ���Pam��� and ���Cece��� on one side, ���Everything else��� on the other] I mean, that���s just pretty killer, right? I mean, maybe it���s stupid. No. [starts crying] It���s wonderful. I���m gonna frame it. I can always unframe it.
I bet Michael had some elaborate theme party planned, like Scrambled Egg Saturday. [a few chuckles]
I recently met Sue, the office administrator at Vance Refrigeration. She has this awesome wall full of fun initiatives and morale boosters and stuff. Sue just goes for it, she's awesome.
No, under no circumstances can you read that letter. It's a violation of her trust.
Every so often, Jim dies of boredom. I think today it was the expense reports that did him in. And our deal is that, it's up to me to revive him.
[looking out the window at Dwight washing the car]  Awww, he did that for me?
[to delivery men] Uh, hi, can I help you? I don't think anyone here-
Michael and Jan together in Jamaica. I guess I would just need a little bit more evidence than seeing it with my own eyes.
Bill Bourbon was my uncle.  I would have never hurt him any more than I'd hurt a June bug.
I don't think Jim cares about his hair.
It's my first day back after maternity leave. And I miss Cece, of course. But we need the money. What was maternity leave like? Oh, how do I explain it?... It rocked. It rocked my ass off.
I've been working forever on Jim's present. He always gives me the best Christmas gifts. He'll take a memory or a private joke, and he'll create something totally unique. I love them. So this year I made him something. A comic book. It stars Jimmy Halpert, a mild-mannered paper Salesman who, while riding his bike through the forest, is bitten by a radioactive bear, becomes 'bear man'. Wreaks havoc on the office. It's really good.
She's talking about the handprints that celebrities make in the cement.
Kevin, you cannot possibly save enough time to see the world.
[Michael comes out with Vikram, arms raised] We got Vikram!
Michael's got a few tricks for Valentine's Day. He found a place where you can get 12 plastic roses for $10 and he's got a great line. 'Me so thorny.'
The weirdest part is Andy. The aftermath got dumped on him and the way he's been handling it is just..so..
So how do you come up with your cartoons?
Yeah. Yeah, I mean I could have used another week, or three.
[telephone ringing] This is Pam. Oh my God, are you sure? Uh, okay. Okay, um, we���ll be right there. Everybody, the balloon is falling.
Okay, here I come. [walks out in her wedding dress]
In Phoenix. They should really tell you that more specifically. I mean, every game is an away game for one of the teams. [long pause] Do we know everything about each other?
Something's up with Jim and Karen.  Not that I've been eavesdropping.  It's not really any of my business, but I've gotten pretty good at reading the back of Jim's neck.
I make that one copy, and I become the girl who makes copies, and by the end of the day I'm receptionist again. And the worst part is, I like making copies. The paper comes out all warm and stuff. And it's cold in there. Cause it's technically a closet.
Oh my gosh, wait until you. This guy was unbelievable. Ok so-
No no no, don't. I will go talk to Angela.
I shouldn't tell you this, but... AJ won't commit to Holly. And she's gonna tell him that if he doesn't propose to her by the end of the year, it's over.
So, Stacy and Eric get to Bogre's DeTech half an hour early so they don't have to sit on the slab.
Man, Angela really had a hold on him. [Dwight playing the recorder in the background]  Angela.
Get the keys out of my purse, start the car. [Jim and Pam slowly back out of the office, Pam has her weapon trained on everyone and then they run out]
I don't know how I fit in with these women. Here. Or with Jan. Um... I mean we get along great. Fine. Um... I guess the person I have the most in common with is...
It's a good shredder, it just keeps breaking.
You can flirt with someone to get what you want and also be attracted to them. How do you think we got together?
Did a good job, Buddy. Now it���s time to come home.
Ok I think animals and proposals are out. Right Ryan didn't you read in one of your blogs that animals are out?
[walking into the annex with Jim] Hey, um...
Well, you have to choose a food option and there's information in there about directions and lodging...
You're gonna throw my things on the ground?
Today is my first day at my new job at Michael Scott Paper Company Incorporated. You know, Apple Computers started in a garage. And we're starting in a condo. So we already have a leg up on Apple. [picks up piece of mail] Look, it's official! [door opens, Michael is in a bath robe]
I don't think so, but they put paint where I didn't want paint. So...
Hon, I wish you would have told me an hour ago, when you knew you weren���t gonna make it.
[loudspeaker] Jim Halpert? Price check on fabric softener, the kind that gives you...
Hey, why is it so quiet? Shouldn't the phone be ringing? Uh-oh. Erin set the phone to voicemail.
He just had to wear his tux today.
Yeah I did a watercolor of Frances Willard Elementary School for a contest they were having. They were calling with the results. And I won. I won! My painting won. So I like to thank my mom for always encouraging me. And I like to thank my dad for buying me my first set of art pencils. And I'd like to thank the sixth grade class that picked me.
I know. It's just even if it was, a great boss and a great job, I just, I don't know, I don't know if I want, um, I don't know if I want this.
You could have just told us what you were thinking.
Why won't you just admit that she's attractive? It's kind of annoying that you won't say it.
What do I think? I think everybody should stay out of everybody's personal business!
Are you okay, Kevin? [Kevin gives thumbs down]
[opens door] Erin.  Michael wants to see you.
Wow, I thought that was supposed to be, like, next month.
Well, you know... actually, I kind of need to stall a bit. But, it's okay, because I am very used to killing time.
But then you fall asleep and there's nothing for me to do.
I can't believe Angela. I went against my better judgment, and I gave her a Save The Date. And now it turns out she complained about me to Toby.
I don't know, I didn't read it carefully, I just saw 'congratulations' and I skimmed the list, I saw my name, I came in here to tell you and get a snack.
Sure, but we should get to the bottom of this. Let's pick a rumor and trace it back to the beginning.
Nope.  I, like you, have never been here before.
[watching Michael's plane take off. Crying and has smeared make up on] No he wasn't sad. He was full of hope. About Colorado, and he was hoping to get an upgrade as an award's member. And he said he was just real excited to get home and see Holly.
This was tough. I suggested we flip a coin. But Angela said she doesn't like to gamble. Of course by saying that she was gambling that I wouldn't smack her.
No, Stacy is a boy.  Ugh.  Frustrating.  Why can't you just be in art class with me?
[voicemail message for Jim]  Sudoku. Level moderate. 18 minutes. Suck on that, Halpert.
Last week Jim wasn���t there, and they named the company Athlead.
Michael, we were thinking maybe we could keep this thing going!
Yes!  Thank you, welcome to my personal hell!
It's performance review day, company-wide.  Last year, my performance review started with Michael asking me what my hopes and dreams were, and it ended with him telling me he could bench-press 190 pounds.  So, I don't really know what to expect.
We did, but mostly because people expect us to. We're also accepting other gifts not on the registry... However much.
Oh, Mema? She's the one in the teal suit. She's the only 80 year old with no smile wrinkles.
He took this job in Philly without telling me. He bought our house without telling me. At a certain point, he��shouldn't��be rewarded for that.
Oscar, Toby, and I are founding members of the Finer Things Club.  We meet once a month to discuss books and art, celebrate culture in a very civilized way.  Sometimes the debate can get heated, but we're always respectful.  There is no paper, no plastic, and no work talk allowed.  It's very exclusive.
So place it on the infinity thing without being obvious, you know? I'd love to do like a color version just to bring a little color to the logo.
Okay, everybody! After you walk the runway everyone has to vote for who gets the coupon book. And you can't vote for yourself.
Hey Jim. Stanley's back from the hospital today. Can you sign his card?
I don't think an apology is enough. I really think the only way for me to learn my lesson is to take my suspension.
Cece was around 22 weeks, but Phillip was much earlier.
Thank you. I appreciate that you appreciate that.
Oh my God, Ryan! That's perfect! You have to go!
I don't know. It seems like a lot for an a cappella group from a college we never went to.
So I'm going to Carbondale this afternoon to get a new bulk shredder.
Yeah, I've seen that with my kids. Um, it is tiny, but I've actually been commissioned by the City of Scranton to paint a mural-
It's a blessing in disguise. Actually, not even in disguise. Sometimes at home, I answer the phone, 'Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam.' So, maybe that'll stop now.
I just did not realize how hard it was gonna be without Jim. I mean, I really respect you for being a single mom all these years. It whipped my ass in half a week. I have to say, there are not a lot of people who could pull off a shaved head, but you are rocking it.
Jim and I are pretty sure she had an affair with her ex-assistant Hunter. He was 17. But she looks great. If she asks, will you tell her I said that?
Kelly really likes to online shop.  Soooo, I felt like I wanted some new clothes.  I mean, I just, I wanted to, it just, I felt like it was time, to maybe um... just get new clothes.
I don't know. I try not to bother him about this kind of stuff.
Well, I will be spending the entire afternoon in grief counseling for someone I've never met.
I don't think those were yours to take.
Hi everyone.  My name is Pam, and I wear glasses.
For what it's worth, I liked your party better.
He left it at reception and we photocopied it.
No, we settled in a much more rational place, remember?
Yes, I said you definitely should go, but you wanted to visit me instead.
Michael, you have to put your hands down.
Australia? I have always wanted to go there?
No, no, no, no, no.  Oh, no. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Nooooo!
The first lesson of watching World Poker Tour at 2:00 AM, you play the opponent. Not the cards.
[raises hand] What is the cash value of a Schrute Buck?
Mm. Excuse me. Could I get some more water?
OK. Dwight. Are you really in charge of picking the health care plan?
[referencing the ���tiny wheel���] Toilets! [everyone cheers as Meredith accepts her chore]
No. Except for the pendant that you bought me. Which I love.
Listen, are you bringing anyone to Jim's party tonight?
The news that you just announced?  That Ed died?
Hold on a second. [turning] Wait, what did you just say?
Roy and I are saving for the wedding, so I made him promise not to get me anything too big.
It's awkward asking people for money, but we could really use it. Why doesn't Crate & Barrel let you register for a toaster full of cash?
Look, seriously, I can move it fine. Come on, let's go, it's our ball. Let's go!
That's okay I can... I'm fine. I'll just play a song in my head.
Hi..  I was just coming out to see what you were doing and to maybe stop you.
Oh, no it's not that, I've actually been thinking that for a long time, and I'm glad I said it. I just... I'm sorry if it made you feel weird.
I don't think so Michael. Besides, I can't cheer against my fiance.
Phyllis... ended up using the exact same invitations as Roy and me. So it was kind of like being invited to my own wedding. And I was like 'Wait, thought I called that off'.
Sure did. I was as surprised as you, but apparently, he is very passionate about public art.
So this was all just a trick. You don���t really have any business to give?
Yeah... you could give it up though right? And almost nobody would know.
I know! No, I'm saying that when I feel overwhelmed, something I like to do is make a list. Make a list of things to do and then start with the easy stuff.
Okay.  So, I'm just not sure if I'm releasing, though.  I'm not sure if...
Oh, Michael. You can't be nasty today. [whispering] 'Cause of the... [points to 'Welcome Daughters!' sign]
Oh, do you mean Darryl? That's a great idea. I'll ask him.
[hangs up phone] Dwight. Dwight. Can you please tell new building owner that he is screwing over all the people he works with, people he's worked with for years. His friends.
I'm at a crucial point where I have sunk 4 hours into that copier, and I am not going to let it beat me like that wireless router did.
Dwight's health care memo. I told you about it.
Shut up Oscar.  What is wrong with all of you, he is sleeping with my mother!
Oh, we're not interested. We're not interested at all.
[at school in NYC] Can't believe this. [pulls out cell phone... sighs]
Jim, Jim, honey, I love you, but you're really distracting me from my distractions.
Bring her to the party. Yeah, we'll have Santa, and we'll play games with her. It'll be a lot of fun.
[serves] Hyuh! [other team misses and Scranton cheers] Well, look at that, we win!
Well I just want to take a minute to talk to you all about something very serious. Once every hour, someone is involved in an internet scam. That man is Michael Scott. [laughter] He's supporting about 20 Nigerian princesses.
I don't demand justice often. I'm not like Angela, who calls a lawyer every time someone watches a YouTube video of animals doing it. But, someone should get fired over this, right? Val's no help. Andy's gone. Jim's out. I just feel like I'm on my own here. [boom microphone bumps her head, she smiles] I mean, OK, not completely on my own. But, in terms of people who can do something. Thank you, Brian.
Oh. Ok. I've heard you exclaim. Like the time you said, 'Hey, look. We parked over here!'.
[Dwight slams something on desk] What was that?
Okay. I'm talking to this woman at daycare...
Yeah, he's making me take notes on these meetings and I'm, like, 'These people are my friends.' But he's all like, 'This is confidential. You can't tell anybody.' But I just feel like I want to... aaah. Just promise me you're not gonna say anything.
Just because two people are hanging out, it doesn't mean that they're together,  you know?  Like people can just be friends.  And I think that it was really unfair to think that there was anything else going on.
No, no, it's not a big deal, please. No. Um, Meredith can I get you something special while I'm at the store, candy, or...or one of those stylish turbans?
It is totally inappropriate, but on the other hand...
No, no, no, no talking. Jim is not allowed to talk until after he buys me a coke.  Those are the rules of jinx, and they are unflinchingly rigid.  [Jim puts money in drink machine, selection is sold out]
Ok. [intense moment where Jim leaves and Pam seems conflicted.  She notices his umbrella and runs out to follow him]
Oh yeah.  Gotta get your REM cycle going with the whole sleeping.  Better than not.
So, detour. We're now adding Nashua to the Lecture Circuit so Michael can confront Holly and get some closure. Nashua actually sounded very excited on the phone. I don't think they get a lot of visitors. Because their office is only accessible by cross-country skis. Hey-oh! [laughs] [whispers] I've been driving too long.
Maybe. I just ...I don't really have anyone to go with.
Because, um, cause I'll never wonder ever again. If I did something wrong and... Now I have closure. She's happy and, I don't know, it feels good.
No, no, it's fine. Just gimme a second.
Roy and I just got back from the Poconos.  I get ten vacation days a year, and I try to hold off taking them for as long as possible, and this year I got to the third week in January.
[Breaks Roy's grip] No, I don't want to go, I don't want to.
She says 'no' to everything. You know, she thinks my name is 'No.' Cece, do you want some broccoli?
My job?  My job is to get married in the morning.  That's my job.
Um, no, I was just, um, just having a cup of coffee, kind of warming up for the day.
Do you mean, leaves as in dies? You want us to throw Toby a New Orleans' funeral?
But instead, you found something to distract you from ever picking out a chair.
Describe him exactly. What color mustard is his shirt? Yellow or Dijon?
Yeah, and when Michael gets a broken heart, this whole place comes to a halt, so we're just trying to get out in front of this.
Okay, well I didn't think about it like that. It's just, I can't do anything about it. I can't replace that one unless that computer breaks.
You are never going to be my father, you get out!
Yeah. Hey, would you excuse me for a second?
[looking at an engagement ring on Angela's finger] It's gorgeous, Angela.
Hey, where's Dwight? He should be a part of this. Has he been acting kinda weird to you lately?
[Pam, Ryan and Michael enter office] Sounds neat.
So now everyone hates Andy, and it's this whole mess, and I don't know what to do.
I want to hit you.  I'll do that.
No, normal women don't do stuff like that. This is bad. [Karen nods and Michael looks like he's about to start crying]
Hey Michael, um... about three months ago, I was talking to... [Michael grabs form and signs it without reading.]
Or have them sing that song! That the frog does in Looney Tunes.
Race had nothing to do with it. I just knew they'd be good together.
[Jim rushes to open door for her] Thank you.
Yeah. He works here. We all know him.
Yeah, I guess. I mean, I kinda liked my old desk mate.
Ten years ago, I didn���t care if Dwight  got married or died a beet-farming bachelor.  But having kids makes you so soft. I used to watch Pulp Fiction and laugh, and now I���m like, that poor gimp is somebody���s child.
I did. And it's just one of those things that's going to keep gnawing at me, like 'gnaw, gnaw, why? Why didn't he? I have no idea why.'
[whispering] Hey, Jim, can I talk to you for a second?
Okay. Um... here it is. Don't put your fingers in there. [shreds paper] Cool huh?
[Pam sees Mose in an outhouse] Oh my God. What century is this?
Yeah, he's so great. Remember how it felt when he cheated on you though?
Michael, I... [sits down] I hate to say this, but... you know this special bond that you've always felt with Ryan, where, like, you're best friends or you're his mentor or something?
Oh, that wasn't the night crew. That was Dwight.
I mean, I don't know. So... what's it like dating a cheerleader?
Do you like it? It's a photo of everyone in the office. So you can take it to Costa Rica.
Ohh, hey Gabe, I'm sorry, we... we didn't get you a cake or anything. We're gonna miss you.
Okay, this is just a Christmas card from your paper supplier. No one's putting this on their fridge.
Is it funny? I thought it was more ...interesting, than funny. [she walks over to see Oscar at the window looking down on man catching a football in parking lot]  I think my water just broke!
Every night, Jim and I watch an episode of The West Wing together on DVD.  Um, he wanted to watch Battlestar Galactica and I wanted to watch Cranford... so we compromised.  Next we're gonna watch Cranford.
Yeah, she has a good point.  I mean, for example, with the last thing you said, by the time you explained it, it actually took up more time.
I can't get a fire pit. I have two babies.
If you're using more than three pieces of tape to wrap a present, you're doing it wrong.
Yeah. I love being on the road, but I especially love the time and a half pay 24 hours a day, for three days. Cause I have a mortgage now, got a bring home the bucks.
Oh, my gosh! People keep blowing it out of proportion! It's not even a history.
Well, I mean, How do you pay back someone for something like that? But, uh, I don���t know. I���m working on something.
So, check this out. According to the handbook, you could make more money as a salesman than as a manager. They have all these incentive programs. I ran your numbers from last year.
No, I mean it. [walks towards Michael] She's really nice and sweet and you guys might actually get along. [hands over card to Michael]
Do you want me to ask where you're going?
[exiting the Ladies' room] Mine too. [Pam and Jim notice the Handicapped stall and walk towards it.  Putting their ears to the door they hear Mr. and Mrs. Vance being intimate]
Hey, um, can I ask you a question?
How would wiping it with a paper towel make it worse?
So, I just wanted to confirm that you're not coming to my wedding.
I can't see them when they're on the floor
Yes. But don't get too excited, 'cause I didn't have a lot of time this year.
[loudly] I need you to sign this! So bad!
Hey, Erin, it's Pam. How ya doing? No, no, don't put Cece on the phone, because she can't talk yet. Okay. No, I was just calling to see how everything's going. Yeah? Yeah? It's good? The play? The play is kind of great. I mean, it's fun to hear Andy sing in the appropriate setting. Now, he's really sorry you couldn't make it, too. Yeah. So thank you so much, again. We're having a great time. Oh, they're flashing the lights so we should go in. Thanks. Bye. Okay, so we called. And everything's fine!
Maybe Michael has a point. I mean, if she was really that upset, she wouldn't still be here.
[sits down] Oh my gosh, I have been chasing people down all day.  It's incredible.
Ok, that's uh, good news [Pam sees Angela eavesdropping] Uh, yeah, no I'll let you go.
They have new phone systems now that can ring directly to a salesman, or someone presses star and they go to accounting, basically 95% of my job.  But I'd like to see a machine that puts out candy for everyone. [realizing] Vending machine.
Everyone from work is here. We weren't planning on that.
He looks a lot like you. How much time did you spend on that?
We are expecting a water delivery today at 10am. What if, as they���re delivering the water jugs, someone screams out, ���Nice jugs���?
You missed two big conference calls today, one with corporate.
[an Asian lady tries to enter the van] Oh, oh, excuse me!  Sorry. Sorry, no.  It's, uh, it's a paper company now.  It's not for the church.
What can I do for you, Michael? I'm kinda busy.
Nothing.  I was just thinking of something else.
Does this have anything to do with what you were talking to Andy about?
Um... but hey? Something kind of cool. There's this internship in graphic design that Jan was telling us about. She made it sound, like, really great.
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. ... Uh, sure, I'll get him for you. [to Michael] It's Jan for you.
My personal favorite is the one he made for his condo association.
[on Bluetooth speaker] Hey, New York ain't free. Get back to work.
Well, I guess it doesn���t look that cool either. But, it���s been up there a long time, so it���s become a pretty big deal.
Okay. This one is the same price but it's got...
[to Jim] I'm sorry, I'm leaving you alone for lunch.
During the course of business, a copier goes though something called 'Normal wear and tear.'
Hey, Toby. [walks past him to Kelly's cubicle]
Well, what about the other stuff that has to be in today?
Did you have a lot of sugar today, Michael?
Oh, wow, it's almost time for ultra feast!  Where's Kevin?
If you talk to her, you're gonna tell her about Stanley, and that's gonna seem more suspicious.
Michael, is, um, sick and he wants one of us to rescue him.
No, I get it, of course. OK. [holds out hand for folder. Jim gives Pam back the folder.]
Yeah, you didn't need to actually say it.
I guess that's why we have a temp, huh?
Yeah! Oh, so I guess Oscar and Jim were talking your ear off about the new copier.
Yeah, yeah, no, no. It���s a good idea to brush your teeth. But you have to um, feed your children. Send them to school. You know, all things you can���t do if you just keep singing ���Monster Mash.���
But sometimes he talks about flesh��� and bacchanals.
Oh- [both look at each other and together say] Thank you.
[through phone] It's been so long since I've been with adults. I am so excited to see everybody. Creed, Ryan. Oh my God, Stanley! Stanley's going to be there. Yes, oh my God!
You know what they say about a car wreck, where it's so awful you can't look away? The Dundies are like a car wreck that you want to look away, but you have to stare at it because your boss is making you.
Kevin, um, let's think of something to distract us. Uh, like the movie Skyfall. You loved the movie Skyfall, right?
I hope you got sound on everything. I'd love a DVD of that. [at computer opens translator. Types in ���Elskere��� which comes back as ���lovers��� Pam smiles]
Guess what poster he had on his wall?
Oh, okay. Okay, I will. [hangs up phone]
[whispering] No, no, no, you have to do it-
Oh, yeah. I'm more than alright. There's just nothing to celebrate.
[in unison] I do not think that is funny.
So you guys, you know what's an even more useful treat...is cash. So-
Yes, it is The Island Luau Inventory '07. It's actually a success compared to Disco Audit '05.
Post-it Notes? What are those worth, 50 cents?
Look, I really need this new chair. I mean, seriously, how is it possible that in five years I've had two engagement rings, and only one chair?
I���ve been through several rounds of development with the team and here���s where we stand with the chore wheel. [introducing a third ���chore wheel���, excited] We���ve got prizes! Ten bucks, candy bar, manager for an hour but, there are also penalties. Like, no internet, Stanley gets your lunch. The one thing that is not on the chore wheel is chores. But they were right; it���s more fun this way.
Good. We watched a video about our changing bodies.
No, I want you to say that you think the 'best' person to be our new manager is a homeless person.
Oh right, okay. Hey Stanley, it's great to see you!
Um, I don't know if I really see you two together.
Michael Scott's Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton, Meredith Palmer memorial, celebrity rabies awareness, fun run race for the cure, this is Pam.
There���s this balloon that has been floating in the rafters of the warehouse for, like, ever. And, okay, it���s not -- it doesn���t sound cool. You just have to see it.
So, what do you say we get started?
Oh, I just get those at any party supply place.
Sure. Just one second. Please have a seat.
Michael we don't know what you're talking about...
It's like mommy and daddy are fighting. Except mommy outranks daddy and mommy is way scarier.
Right, and if you're interested in the way more fun party, all the info can be found here on our more brightly colored flyer. [Angela rips down brightly colored flyer and walks away. Karen rips down Angela's flyer.]
Jan called. She's coming in later to talk to you.
Um, just cause, that, you work together, and it might be awkward.
[holds up rice krispie shaped like a star] In the name of Nutcracker Christmas.
I'm sorry. You guys have probably noticed my stomach's a little more sensitive lately. So, if you wouldn't mind wearing a little less perfume... and if your lunch is especially pungent, maybe have it in the break room?
Never underestimate the power of a good night's sleep.
[laughs] Oh boy. Oh no, I���m not laughing at you. I���m laughing at, um, something that Cece did on the playground earlier -- yesterday. This morning.
No. Thanks... uh we're still having lunch today, right?
Come on, let's go. I wanna call your doctor.
I don���t think you guys understand why we���re doing this. It���s-
[stands up; gets into stance] Okay wait-- it's-- you're saying it comes from the foot.
[on the phone] Hey Kelly, my stuff just got here. [Kelly screams with excitement into the phone and Pam has to take it away from her ear]
Well... I have a job right now, so I can't really take time off...
I know Jan didn't poison the food. I know that. But if she was going to poison the food of someone at that table wouldn't it be me? Michael's former lover?
Because she's conflicted.  She has to be professional, but she's fighting feelings... for you.
[imitating Cookie Monster] 'Hey, Erin, You look delicious. I mean, beautiful.'
I was hoping for a righteous mob, and I ended up with Dwight and Nellie. But, they both have a mob mentality. And, I'm pretty sure Dwight has a pitchfork in his car.
Well it was great catching up with you. And I'll see you around the building.
It says ���Lotto Pool���, right on top. [points to obvious title]
Do you want us to count to three?
So apparently no one dresses up for Halloween here. I wish I had known that before I used greasepaint for my moustache. And I can't even take off my hat, because then I'm Hitler.
Dwight, there is one rule that you need to take very seriously.
Oh! Gossip, who is it? Who is it? Who is it, Michael? ...Who?
Jim is really talented. And he should be the one who's getting a better job offer. Like, for real.
Yeah, Jim barely talks to Mike. We had to go through like two levels of friends to even find his profile. Jim picked someone just unattractive enough to shut me up without tipping it.
Um, I don't think so, I just bought it.
Yeah, I needed to take care of some stuff.
Um, I can offer you free delivery on any order that you place today. Okay, twenty boxes? I can do... just a second. I can do 20 boxes at 43 dollars a box. Great!
I just helped someone out. It feels good.
Andy, why should she have your crappy computer?
We were wondering if you would like to have dinner with us tonight, in our home, and play with our baby.
We should have hired a professional to take our mental pictures.
Ah, yeah. We haven't told anybody, but it's going really great. [looks at Jim] Right?
This is Michael, my boss. [she points] Justin.
[enters the office and has another contraction]  Oh, whoa.  Ha.  Wow.
I just wanted to get out of my room for a little while.
The shipping place closes in a half hour.
They say if you're nervous around someone you should picture them naked. I do not recommend this strategy. Try picturing them with more clothes on... or a funny coat.
Much different the second time around. And I have to say; it is nice not being the only pregnant woman in the office.
You made him lose the account by screaming at him the entire time.  It's okay, Ryan.
Yeah, just a little, I have a lot to deal with today.
He's not here. I don't know where he is.
She's sweet and cute. I thought you'd get along.
But don't you also have girlfriends in Paris?  Like a lot of them?
Oh, hey, guys! I'd like to introduce you to a new little friend of mine.  His name is New Year's resolution board.
Stop eating it! Do you wanna be happy? Look at you. You have a major self-destructive streak in you.
I don't know.  I just, I can't tell if she's getting anything.
We did that. So, what's next? Michael, just stop for a second. [reaches out to take the whisk] Michael. Stop for a second.
You just said that we're gonna be gone...?
Michael, I think that feeling only goes one way. And I think that Ryan knows that, and he's taking advantage of you.
But I'm holding on because I keep waiting for Sandra Bullock to show up.
What's that come to? Like, what did they each win?
Yeah, that might be weird. Overall though, we still all have our jobs... so, good news, right?
No, that's a great idea. Let's have a code name. How about Mondays? I hate Mondays? Mondays are the worst?
[points to smoke] Oh, my God! Uh, Oh my God!
We only had tonight free, and we really wanted to spend it with you.
And we move to the south of France. See? No, there's plenty of bicycling for you. I think that's where they do the Tour de France.
Oh, yeah, in my fancy new apartment. I have one bedroom, one bathroom, and a closet.
I don't think we should eat Packers' cupcakes. We can't give him the satisfaction.
When are you ever responsible for your actions?
Sick, like lots of sniffling. I don't know.
Just terrible.  And the longer you put it off, the worse it's going to get.
And, I haven't gotten paid yet. I'm not blaming you.
Okay, first off, my Keds. Because I couldn't have done it without them. [people clap] Thank you. Let's give Michael a round of applause for MC-ing tonight because [people start clapping again] this is a lot harder than it looks. And also because of Dwight too.
We need another approach. Um, we need to fine the weakest one and separate him from the group. [they notice Nate struggling with a box] Yeah. I think if we could get Nate alone, we could crack him.
I think so.  I don't know, I was mainly focused on the cup holders.
Yeah, well if it breaks all the way I can get you a new one.
Because the thing you're saying I'm good at, is pushing a big green button a bunch of times.
That was weird, huh? It's all part of the presentation. It was confusing, right? Because confusing situations happen to us all the time in our jobs. [pauses] I'm just trying to bridge the gap between what just happened and the fact that I'm going to be doing the rest of the presentation.  [reading from the cards, in Forrest Gump voice] Sales is like a box a chocolates, you never know which vendor you're gonna get. Forrest Gump.
Except where Juliet doesn't have that great a time and Romeo doesn't call back after two dates.
[smiling] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. One moment I'll transfer you.
Oh my God, I think we've been robbed!
And, I feel God in this Chili's tonight. WHOOOOOOOO!!!!
Why are you assuming you'd get the whole thing?
He told me how he felt and I guess I had feelings too, and we kissed.
Just listen. Remember that casino night about a month before we were supposed to get married? I kissed Jim.
Yes... nice!  I can't remember the last time someone made me dinner.
OK. Well, here's something you don't know. A couple of weeks ago-
That's a really... well fine,  Do the German instructions say what this is supposed to do?
You've already disappointed him so much.  He can't be expecting a lot from you.
Everyone, can I have your attention.  This is the moment you've all been waiting for. Right? [drum roll on copier]
Not almost, though, Holly. I mean, not -- not close to 200...
Let's see. Andy has been manager for a hundred and five days. Which means I've heard 'Closing Time' a hundred and five times. [nods and shakes head] Still don't know the words. Tah wa Ta way hm hm home and home and home.
I know you're a very busy man so I'll cut right to the chase. I'd like my old job back.
I don't think Jim means to say that you shouldn't touch her.
[looking with Kevin at the art show flyer] Should be fun.
[talking head with Jim] We haven't told anyone I'm pregnant.
Um, do we have to sleep in your parent's bedroom?
Angela, you're the chairman of the party planning committee. I shouldn't even be planning this, it's your job.
Thank you. [takes bite] Oh my gosh. It's really good.
Oh, don't worry about it. I mean, it's better than listening to Michael play a conch shell... which is what I was doing. Oh, also, Michael went to Jamaica with Jan!
Creed. I noticed you don't have a resolution on the board. What's yours?
Um, actually, funny story -- I didn���t get it. I shouldn���t have been so cocky about my rectangle-holding skills after all.
Just one. 'This weather makes me want to stay at home, curled up with a good book.'
[laughs] No. The Odd Life of Timothy Green.
Oh, we wanted to, but our sitter just fell through. I'm really sorry.
They said they were done with the investing and then you volunteered ten thousand dollars?
Hey Meredith, I need your supplier requests today.
We wrote a good review.  Under comments, we wrote, the natural aroma of the beets drifts into the bedroom and makes you dream of simpler times.
Jim, what if we both lose our jobs?  I'm trying to think of a way that this all ends up fine, and I can't think of one.
[sees Erin holding Cece] Oh, my God! Go, go!
I'm done. What are you... Is that supposed to be my mural?
So, um... we'll do it after work.  In the parking lot.  In front of everyone.  I'm going to hit you as hard as I can.
I told you, I have the number that rings here. Do you want that number?
Yeah, but we don't have a power cord.
Robert! Okay, oops! I deleted them all. They���re all deleted.
[opens teapot] Oh my god! The yearbook picture!
I'm guessing Angela's the one in the neighborhood who gives the trick-or-treaters some toothbrushes. Pennies. Walnuts.
No, no, no, no. Undo that. Undo that.
And you kind of torpedo every romantic relationship you're in.
Well, he seems really happy being back here at Dunder Mifflin.
You know what? It's fine, it's fine. Let me just...it's fine. [Pam leaves work bus]
Well, I mean, it's an iPod. But ..
So what are you going to get me instead?
Oh... God.  Oh my God, he's gonna jump.
Thanks.  My costume's getting a lot of attention. [Pam is dressed as Charlie Chaplin]
There are a few people I decided not to invite, and that might make things kind of awkward but ...  it's my wedding. And I don't want anyone there who has called me a hussy.
Wow. He is officially the worst human being.
They're both single, I have a sense they might-
Do you think you could work from this? [showing Tattoo artist sketch pad] we made some small adjustments.
Look, I'm not the one who asked you to do a split when you've never done one before.
I asked Tom and Pete to come early so we could play a prank on Jim at lunch! Pretty awesome, right? I think they're into the idea. They're probably thinking, 'That Pam Beasly, she's the coolest sister-in-law on the planet. She's the best! The absolute best.'
HEY!  COME ON!  Let's listen to Dwight's presentation! [Dwight winks at Pam]
Michael, this is a terrible terrible thing you've done.
It just- [Kevin banging and shaking the snack machine]  To be making a case for passion in Edwardian times, I thought was, uh...
Oh, do you want me to repeat the messages that I gave you before for the... [nods toward camera]
You're right, you're right. I'm a middle class broad. [Jim does his 'Jim face']
Yeah, it was great because it was like you're supposed to be working, but nothing ever gets done.
So, Jordan, uh, where did you work before?  Uh, a law office?
Seems like a basic reward system where you give us points, and then we redeem those points for prizes.
Got it. I will put out a A.P.B. Otherwise known as a 'Ask Pam Beasley'. ... Did the phone cut off?
[on phone] So, there was no sales call.
It's funny you bring that up because yes it is.
Can we take a look at the suite now?
That's the weirdest possible solution to the problem.
Maybe we'll use a DJ. That's the one thing Roy's in charge of for this wedding but all he's managed to do is set a date.
I have the lowest sales record of anyone here.
[holding lamp] You like it? It's kinda designy and cool, it was $8.00.
Okay. I'd never heard that before. So, thank you.
You know, I bet Ryan thinks to himself 'I wish I were a volunteer sheriff on the weekends'.
Uh, just off the top... I think she'll be here this afternoon.
See, we knew it! If he just met her, he'd understand.
No, he's actually been really nice and helpful.
[everyone cheers as Meredith spins and lands on ���tiny wheel���] The tiny wheel actually does have chores. It���s so cute no one seems to mind.
Unless someone very close to us is in immediate physical danger, you should not be calling us.
An impression, then.  Lastly, we can't help but notice that he was by himself when he died, but of course, we all know that doesn't mean he was alone.  Because I'm sure that there were lots of other birds out there who cared for him very much.  He will not be forgotten.
[points to Jim's iPod] You have new music?
Okay. Well, if you think of it, I'll be here.
No, no. 'Cause the ice melts and then it's like second drink! [laughs]
Michael has employed Dwight to track you down.
Oh great. Um, no, this weekend? Nothing. I'm not really doing anything.
I'm sorry. Did that? That was out of the blue-
No, I met his wife in Mommy and Me. They're a great couple. You should meet them later.
[with Jim, holding the baby]  She's incredible.  Want to count her fingers and toes again?
The phone has been ringing off the hook. The guys in Philly are kind of going nuts.
Oh ok, but in order for us to make it, there can't be any secrets between us.
Sometimes we're so excited we forget where we are. Like at a business meeting.
So he doesn't share it with his daughter but he shares it with his daughter's fiance?
[to camera, tearing up, smiling] I'm sorry, what was the question?
Well count yourself lucky. Wait until you have two. That's two sleep schedules, two naps that don't coincide, I mean, you'll never sleep again.
The thing about Jim, is when he's excited about something, like the Office Olympics, he gets really into it and he does a really great job. But the problem with Jim is that he works here, so that hardly ever happens.
I'd also like to say a few words if that's okay.
What? [Jim shakes his head] Did you want to tell me something? You look like you want to tell me something. [Jim shakes his head no] You look like you have something really important to say and you just can't for some reason. [Jim smiles] Come on, you can tell me. Jim, you can tell me anything. [Jim stops smiling and looks down. Pam wonders what that means]
The goal of this meeting is to get everybody excited about their resolutions! Who's been good about their resolutions so far? Erin. Tell us about it.
I'm really happy to be back with Roy. I think it shows maturity. Maturity and dignity. ... Is that braggy? I don't mean it to be braggy.
We came to an agreement. We're going to live in a stunning pre-war brownstone at the top of a mountain.
I think you need to go to Florida.
I don't know, I kind of hate all our regular places right now. Oh, you know what [Jim gets down on one knee], that one...
[looks at to Jim] I am. [looks at Angela] It's about the Save The Date.
There's a finger-painting station and a curly slide. Am I too old to go here?
Is this because Jim walked in on you going to the bathroom?
I thought I was very specific about you not letting up a magician.
I don't think I'm asking for too much. I guess it's just the end of courtesy in the workplace.
Oh, I made us a date to take my mom out to dinner to thank her for all that extra babysitting.
He locked himself in his office all morning working on it.
I have so many people to thank for this award.
[after Angela gives her a stack of files]: I'm going into labor!
I mean, I know that we said no big gifts, but I was kind of hoping you'd get me
Do you want me to help you with that?
Mose, Angela hasn't been around here much lately, has she?
I guess some new people might be coming from Stamford. Should be fun. New blood.
I wish that you'd stop rubbing that lamp in that creepy way.
Oh no, I just, I decided to stay.
You know, there are a lot of guys out there who would just love and appreciate a-
So, let's say my teeth turn to liquid and then, they drip down the back of my throat. What would you call that?
No... [Jim leans in for another kiss] Jim---
Well, other things you can do to help cut down on the spread of disease are to wash your hands regularly. Don't come in if you're sick.
Let's see.  I had an aunt that I was really close to.  She was this amazing female boxer.  Um, anyway, she was injured in a fight, and she was paralyzed.  So, you can imagine how upset I was when I found out that she asked her manager to remove her breathing tube so she could die.
If Dwight's about to get fired, you have to tell him. Just get the words out. That's all you can do.
And Jim can jump back in without skipping a beat. We���ll come back to visit. But I think it���s time for us to officially���
[looks over at Oscar, who is quietly watching this happen] I hope... you have a very beautiful wedding, Angela.
We invited everyone in the office to our wedding.  Even though we realized most people wouldn't be able to make the drive to Niagara Falls.  [whispers] Which is why we're having it in Niagara Falls.  [normal volume] Then Michael told everyone they could have Friday and Monday  off, if they came.  So now, people have to decide if they want to come to our wedding or have to work.
Hey.  I'm not going to get in the car, because I know if I do you'll try to drive me to the hospital.
She's just, she's really tentative about latching, and I just, I want to keep her self-esteem up.
It���s getting tougher. I just didn���t know that it was gonna be this hard.
We wanted to stay on the phone all day, but the company has a policy against eight-hour personal calls. So we're not telling anyone.
That is right. Don't make any more of it.
Yeah, I mean, admitting you need help is the first step!
You don't have to wait that long. I mean, you don't have to wait a month to ask her out. Just ask her out.
You told me to buzz you about the suggestion box meeting when Jan was here.
Kelly, we're going to visit Meredith at lunch.  [Kelly's lying down on floor, head unseen under desk.  She rolls to her side, away from Pam]  Kelly?
[to Jim] Hey! You can just give her your extension.
Well, to speak my truth, I switched to coffee in March.  There's a new espresso machine. But I still acknowledge and appreciate the gesture.
Now that I think about it, Angela and Andy might actually make a good couple.  But I couldn't do that to Dwight... or Angela... or Andy.
We signed Cici up for this daycare. It's on the other side of town. The traffic...
[Clears her throat] The party planning committee, minus Angela, has decided that we're all going to do Dwight's Christmas.
Umm, I put stickers so you know where to sign.
[singing] Just smile for me and let the day begin.  You are the sunshine that lights my heart within... on the wings of love ...
Hey, I was thinking about dinner--- [Jim grabs her face and kisses her]
[to Cece] Hm. Don't listen to her. She's just jealous 'cause she doesn't get to come home to someone as cute as you.
Right.  And, you wouldn't be able to talk to Karen.
I'm coming back the wrong way.  [smiles at Jim across the parking lot] It's not because of you.  I don't like graphic design. That's it. [laughs] Stop smiling. I really didn't like it.  It's just designing logos and stuff.... and I miss Scranton.  But it is not because I missed you. I just really wanted to come home... and I know you said to come home the right way, but you can't tell me what to do. Got it?
Michael, there's a Charles Miner here to see you.
Yeah, I'm gonna do some mock ups, and then turn those into thumbnails, maybe do some... splash frames. [laughs] I don't know what I'm talking about but I'm excited.
[gets up and walks over to Angela, whispering to her] Hey. Thanks for ratting me out!
Come down and... open it and you'll see.
I think one of her cats did once. She came in with scratches all over her face. [both laugh]
Wait, when did we start calling it that-
Yeah, I get all the memos. [starts to leave]
I really like Valentine's Day in this office. It's kinda like grade school. Everybody gives out little presents and stuff. Like last year, Jim gave me this card, with Dwight's head on it, it was horrifying and funny and...
Yeah. I was kinda hoping you could. I gotta go. Bye. [to Dwight] Come on. [camera pans to Clark duct taped to a chair]
Hey, good luck. When you get to Philly, will you tell Jim I miss him?
[in a car with Andy, by the dumpster you can see a new computer box] So listen, we have to really scuff this up.
What no, wait! You said you were gonna help us!
Nellie, I could practice with you in my car at lunchtime.
Oh, great. I forgot mine and I'm wearing a two piece.
I have one idea of what it means.
Okay, well, I just sorta meant, like, cute, right?
After I had my little outburst at the beach, Jim was really nice about it. He just basically said that he missed my friendship too and I would always mean a lot to him and I understand where he's coming from.  For the record, I am not embarassed at all. It needed to be said, and I said it, and it only took me three years to summons the courage, so [quietly, and mock bowing] thank you.
Coming to Scranton. Is anyone coming to Scranton?
[Nate starts walking away from hornet's nest, puts down the blowtorch] Yes!
Well, a gay man would not leave the store wearing those shoes!
Yes, I'll be sure someone returns your call.  I'm so sorry.  Bye.
Because some people think you monopolize the conversation by trying to be funny.
Twelve drummers drumming. [marching drum band lines up to perform, Andy steps out with cymbals]
It might seem crazy, but since there's no one left in New York, Michael is Dunder Mifflin's highest ranking employee. So, that's where we are.
We'll find another receptionist. I mean, that's easy. We'll be fine. [Andy nods reluctantly]
Oh my god! I love it! Uh, I���Nellie, this is brilliant!  [sees Jim] Hey!
Seriously? This is what's so important, putting naked pictures on the desktop?
Roy's sister looked into it, and the application alone costs a thousand dollars.
Hide, they���re giving out jobs upstairs. Why don���t you go up and get one?
Yeah, maybe I'll just move in with my boyfriend 'cause he's kind of a slob, too.
Um, so, finally, I want to thank God. Because God gave me this Dundie.
Yes. But there's, wait, oh, there's a funny ending to that story. I can't remember.
Mmm-mm.  I'm probably just gonna stay here for a while, say I got lost.
But Andy does, so we have to watch it with him.
Exactly. That should tell you how terrible the chairs are.
49 again? That's nine years in a row.  This is now our longest family tradition.
And we're also supposed to speak our truths.
I got back at Frank in the most fitting way possible. With my art. The paints are water-based. It's gonna come off with a hose. But, I think the lesson will last a very...
He is in my room icing his balls.
Uh, not on a three month boat trip.
Oh, you guys.  Just one second.  [picks up phone] Oh my gosh!  Are you serious?  Shipping emergency.  I don't think I can go to lunch.
Great. Well, Let me know if you need a new chair, or anything that an Office Administrator can handle.
Yesterday, they delivered the new one. But they didn't set it up. So my day just got a little more interesting. [holds up a huge manual]
[accent] It wasn't me.  I'm not goin' down for this!
We're small, but we're eager to make a name for ourselves.
So we just... we wanna help you plan the proposal so that it's safe and responsible and realistic and doable.
Ok, wait, so that would make me [walks to side of room] like right here.
Cut.  That was your best apology video ever.
The guy has an algorithm to determine the winner of any given college basketball game.
I worked until about 2:45 AM. And then I had to decide if I wanted to spend the night with Michael editing in his office, and Dwight watching Michael edit in his office, or drive home and probably fall asleep at the wheel and die in a fiery car wreck. I passed out on my keyboard trying to decide.
The ones for drivers to check their blind spots?
I���m kidding! Oh my gosh you guys! She���s obviously super cute I get it. But I���d like to point out there���s 50 pounds more of me to love if that���s your thing.
I need to fit into my wedding dress. However, I'm also pregnant.
[approaching Michael at elevators] Michael? [to others] He's over here!
Do I at least get to go with you in this fantasy?
Maybe sort of ahead of his time as a writer.
No, I don't know what the future holds, but... I'm optimistic.  And, uh, I had fun goofing around with Dwight today.  Jim and I... are just... too similar.  Maybe one day I'll find my own Karen. But--- you--- that is, a, um, you know, not--- A man.  A man version.  But, uh, until then... I can hold my head up. ... I'm not gay.
Angela made several 911 calls about cars going too fast in front of the building, so the police put up a radar gun. It's actually caused a bit of a traffic hazard.
Yes, and then we decided that was crazy.
If you wanna do something for the funeral...
[looks at list] When did you add this to the list?
Oh, wait, I gotta go, class starting. [hangs up]
[to Jim] Why don't you talk to him about it?
Angela, you seem so happy. I bet you wish you were like this all the time.
[getting out of the car] What are we doing at your parent's house?
Oh, and then this was Phyllis���s idea���[shocked cheers] So nasty Phyllis!
[imitating Deangelo's pretend juggling routine] Look.  I'm juggling eggs and bowling balls.  I'm juggling with one hand.  No hands.
I'm sorry, we're throwing a party for someone because they're being horrible?
Yes. Yes, I desperately want to speak with you about my sex life with Jim.
How far away does she live now, like ten minutes?
Yeah. Hey Michael, look at this lamp. $8.00.
Hey, Michael left early, so a bunch of us are going to go to Poor Richard's for happy hour. You should come.
Oh yeah, sure. Um, I hope I can help.
Wow, there are, there are questions to that. Okay. Um, you know what, no questions. Last item on the agenda, Toby would like to make an announcement.
Yeah, I think I made the right choice.
Okay great.  [Isabel kisses her cheek] Yeah, I'll see you in a second.  [pauses] Wait, what? [tries to follow, but veil gets caught on wall and tears] Oh! Oh no!
Michael, Ryan wants to introduce the branch managers in a few minutes.  You just have to wave and introduce yourself.
Well, I feel like she needs to eat, but she won't latch on, which is weird, because the other baby di...
Yeah, no, he asked for you specifically. He's in the conference room.
No, I umm, well I'm not gonna, I'm, I'm not gonna move in with anyone unless I'm engaged.
No. It's a jokey saying. Pobody's nerfect, like I can't even say those words right. Ha.
Oh, excuse me! I'm fine with my choices!
[gasps] Yes! Cece wanted to thank everybody for letting her daddy stay home with her all last week and play, so she brought you a little treat.
Jim, I don't want the first thing the baby hears to be the 8 Mile soundtrack.
I actually might not go. Feeling kind of tired.
Oh... um... no.  That's... um... That's actually fine
Um... ���A���... ���X���? I don���t -- you got me.
[feels a pain in her breast] Ooh. Ah-ah-ah. Ha-ha.
Yeah, and there's this one when we were listening to music and it's like, it's like w were in love and we didn't even know we were in love and it's...but- Do you think Jim's changed?
Dwight, that was really nice. You should ask for her number.
[her text tones rings] Dwight stopped the device!
Ummm. Oh! I'll say he's related to Richard Nixon. It's an inside joke. He looks really Nixon-y when he wakes up.
My old art room. [finds a sheet of blank paper] Oh, maybe it's still here! [looks for her painting] No. No they must have taken it down. Never mind.
I don't really have any control over that Stanley.
[breathes deeply and runs across coals] Oooh, uh hah, ooh! Wha-hoo! Ahhhh...
No, because... [Dwight and Michael walk in and march into Michael's office, silencing the conversation]
[laughs] No, I was just checking out my present. [holds up teapot]
You mean the frozen mice for the piranha?
Um, Karen left her blindfold on the longest but she also threw her egg at Jim.
Oh in three months we can. Check the lease, and if you don't undo all the changes you've made, we're moving. Hey guys, can I show you some pictures.
Michael told us to wait in here. We don't know why.
Nope, that's Dr. Laura. Well, her show Biz Whiz wants someone from Dunder Mifflin to come on the air today. Does anybody feel particularly passionate about local business issues? [Dwight raises hand]
Really? I've been putting the kids to bed by myself every night for a months. And you had to miss one phone call. Is that your truth, Jim? That's really your truth?
Jim doesn't let me wash his NFL jersey during the playoffs. How is this any less logical?
Well Darryl, no kid wants to buy their own Christmas presents.
Uh, I have to stay here and answer the phone.
Yes, I found it in a shelf in the corner of the warehouse. [Darryl gives the camera an odd look]
I'm not - I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that.
And then on the weekends, would you hacky sack back to reality and spend time with your wife and kids?
Michael likes me to run the camera when he makes his apology videos. My favorite is the one for his mother.
[on phone] Yes! Yes! I would love to!
Yes, Jim, I think I know how to point a rectangle at something.
Ok, um, why don't we just finish the game? Michael, it's your shot.
Yes, the conference room is set up. I've got pens, I've got paper, I've got a whiteboard, we are good to go!
Sometimes when we IM, I send you that little winking face with the lipstick.
Michael doesn't know how to work his BlackBerry.  So when he says BlackBerry me a message, he means write it on a Post-it note and stick it to his BlackBerry.
What do we know about this bird?  You might think, 'Not much.  It's just a bird.'  But we do know some things.  We know it was a local bird.  Maybe it's that same bird that surprised Oscar that one morning with a special present from above.
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Sure, can I ask who's calling? Just a second.
Hey Dad. No I know, Mom told me. Ok. Yeah I'll see ya then.
Give it back for what? What're you gonna do with it?
I have the most boring job in the office, so... why wouldn't I have the most boring job on beach day?
Well, this building isn't far, and its much newer. There's a dry cleaner, nail place and a gym. Oh, and it's next-door to and Outback so it always smells like steak.
And he wants to take the WaveRunners to the lake this Saturday so...
The thing I like most about Recyclops is that he's creating a different world for our child.
Oh, no, it's just that if a vampire had to cough, he would do it like this. [coughs into elbow]
No, it doesn't have to just be cow stuff, right?
[on other end in conference room] Please hold for Ms. Black.
Can you put me down I'm getting a little nauseous?
Mm-hmm.  Yes, I'm fine.  Um, yeah, the doctor said it's still considered a minor contraction as long as I can talk through it.
Oh. That's totally cool. You can do whatever you want.
[voicemail message for Jim] Hey, what's that word we made up when you have a thing stuck in your shoe?  Anyway, I have a thing stuck in my shoe.
Unless it's exposed to oxygen. Then it becomes extremely toxic!
Yeah, I think the pregnancy really brought us together.
[Pam and Meredith singing karaoke] This one's for all you ladies out there.
Oh, hey, if you go by the Banshee Pub, tell the Man In Black I say hello.
Stealing? What am I supposed to have stolen?
I am. You should come dance with us.
Why do you need to wear the holster at all?
Oh my God, what is going on, is Dwight ok?
Maybe this is good. Finding another job is a pain. There's another annoying boss, another desk, I'd have to learn everything all over again. So, there are reasons to stay.
I'm saving that 'cause I like it when the cards go T-ts-ts-tch-tch-tch.
Not even. I'm doing laundry for the first time in like a month.
Listen, um��� I was scared, you know? I loved what I had, and I didn���t want to risk it. And I think that maybe I did doubt him a little too. Which was wrong because he���s shown me time and again. But when the documentary started airing, people on the street told me that I had this fairy-tale romance. But there were a lot of times last year where it did not feel like a fairy tale. But then it got deeper, and it got stronger and now it���s better than a fairy tale. It���s like a long book that you never want to end.  And you���re fine with that because you just never, ever wanna leave it.
No. [Kevin leaves; Pam takes off her glasses; phone rings] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Okay, go ahead. [puts a notepad close to her face and writes message]
Is this what I've become? Materialistic? Shallow? I feel horrible. [looks down at the check] oh look! 'Mrs. Pam Halpert!' That's the first time I've seen it in writing!
[voicemail message for Jim] Hey, guess what?  I moved my computer so I can't see Michael's head.  It's working.  I think I can have a career as a very specific type of decorator.
Forget it. I'm never gonna know what goes on there.
I went out to look for a better office space.
About 40 times a year, Michael gets really sick, but has no symptoms. Dwight is always gravely concerned.
I know. Yeah, and it was going really great at first. I got video.
Hey. [walks up to Oscar and hands him a report to sign]
Wow, this place is��� so great. I had no idea ��� on the phone, you made it sound kind of dinky.
Last week, Michael sent out this mysterious memo.
Don't tell him I said this, but I always thought he was kinda cute.
Has she been on the phone the whole time?
Well, the promo for the documentary aired today.
I thought I'd stay and answer the phones.
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh, hi Jan. He's, uh, on a sales call. No message? Bye, Jan.
She said everything with the wedding goes by so fast we should try to take mental pictures of the high points.
I don't know, I just, I really thought Jim was gonna propose tonight...
Jan called and asked where you're going to meet for dinner.  She wants you to call her.
This is a ridiculously awful plan. Because you cut everything.
[on phone]: Did you send Dwight on a quest for the Holy Grail?
Ok. Um, a fisherman is walking down Fifth Avenue walking an animal behind him-
I was in the meeting with Jan and she did say that it could be this branch that gets the axe.
[puts hand up for high five] Same religion.
If he comes out, distract him. [takes list to copier]
Frank and beans! [both laugh] So what'd we decide for Michael, the bottle of rum, or the seashell alarm clock?
[surveying an untidy office] The building���s custodian is on vacation for the month and Dwight is too cheap to hire a replacement. So, instead, we���re living in filth. But, not for long. Because I have created the chore wheel.
Hey, Angela.[hands her a Save The Date card] I didn't have your zip code.
[whispering] Angela, are you ready for the wedding?
I'm supposed to turn the lock when I leave, it's part of my job.
Dressing up as somebody-I mean, when has that ever worked for you?
I don't know!  Let's go by the house and get it.  It's only twenty minutes past the hospital!
Michael, you need to get out of this.
Yeah, yeah. Like when he presses 'Doors closed' the doors open. Or he presses 'lobby' it goes to third floor, stuff like that. Can you do that?
Which just means we get to see more of our lovely street. Tell them what we saw today Jim.
So many memories in this old gym. Pretending I have PMS so I didn't have to play volleyball, pretending I have PMS so I didn't have to play basketball. Those were the days!
[as Jim receives and declines a call] Who���s that?
Hey, Angela? Did you hear about the Irish-American Cultural Center mural?
Wow. Thank you. Um, that must have been hard for you to relive that. Both of you.
Well, of course not, but does physical appearance include smell?
Yeah, he tried to set up my TIVO for me but then I didn't have audio for a week.
[Michael knocks on Pam's desk] Yeah? [Michael points at Pam, himself, and Meredith, mimes drinking, driving, then points to his watch and holds up five fingers] I weirdly know exactly what you're saying to me.
Hey, Meredith I need to tell you something.
Look at the huge offices Jim, check out that conference room.
It's fine.  Erin, you're going to go.  And you're going to make sure Michael tells the truth.
We're the party planning committee, and we did not get where we are by playing it safe. We got here by being risk takers. And, yeah, Dwight's party is gonna be terrible. Maybe. Maybe it's not. Maybe it's going to be great. And if it's great...I think we all know what that would mean to us.
Well done. And we managed to kill the entire morning.
Hey, put me down. Put me down. [Meredith turns and looks at Jim and Pam] Oh my god, hey, put me down. Hey...
No. No no no! [nos coming from all employees]
Okay. [Jim and Pam hug] Good luck. You're gonna be great.
Maybe because you hated her present so much.
No Dwight, not the good peanut butter. People are going to get mad.
Yeah. I'm in charge of this whole area.
So... here's the gift. You get to decide what his top secret mission is. [Jim smiles] Sorry I didn't wrap it.
[laughing] I'm just saying, Roy is very competitive.
[sighs] It���s fine. It���s just a seating arrangement. Doesn���t matter.
Well, I wish that made me feel better. Listen, so everybody saw the promos and they're kinda freaking out. [Brian laughs] Cause it seems like you got a lot of private stuff on camera-
Well, you know... they don't call me the Bart Simpson of Scranton for nothing.
Michael once told me that Home Alone is the saddest movie ever. When I asked him why, he said, 'Because the whole family forgets the kid at home. There is nothing funny about that.'
Well, you should cover it with the broccoli.
Merry Christ--[looks up] NO! Why... why did you bring that here?
Oh, can I help? We could say someone is related to, uhm, Tonya Harding.
All right. I did not come back here just to see you.
Yeah, okay, I���m sorry. I���m sure we can get a copy. A lot of people were taping it.
[watches Jim score in ping-pong against Darryl] Yes! Way to go. [looks at Kelly] See that?
Yes, you clean all the mugs in the sink.
You know, you're in a meeting, and nobody knows that you've had sex there, except for you and him.
Just let us open up the presents, Dwight.
I figured I'd catch you walking to your car, but...
We got you this. [gives a bottle of wine]
Nope.  No, no, that's better.  That wasn't even the worst of them.  I'm fine.
Oh no, don't, don't, don't, don't. [Michael laughs] Aah! [laughs, then leaves] Okay...
Meredith...  [copier has an error] Oh... so uh... G-44.  It's not ready Kevin!
Do you want me to beat him up for you?
Alright, I will get a card at the hospital and we'll sign it outside her room.
I���m sure Athlead will be a huge success. But I don���t want him to do it anymore, and I don���t want to give him an ultimatum, but I am not moving our family to Philly.
No, Sarah Kaya comes in.  Don't interrupt, I have like thirty seconds to finish this and get to DigiPres.
No��� don���t. Just put it out of your mind.
So, Melissa... I met your mom a couple times. She's
[shocked after seeing the torn up carpet] Hey��� What happened here?
I wonder if she'll start calling you 'Jim'.
I want us to make it. I want a fresh start.
[in New York, humming to herself to the tune of 'Centerfold'] Na na na na na. Na na na na na na na.
I'm the office administrator now, which means I'm basically being paid to be head of the party planning committee. The first thing I did as head... I shut it down. At its best it was a toxic political club used to make others feel miserable and left out. At its best it planned parties.
Ready! [flips sketch pad showing tattoo possibilities] ���I���m not as think as you drunk I am!��� [crowd claps and cheers]
Maybe you could play a song on your recorder.
This is where I used to keep my computer.
Tell me one thing about you I don't know.
Dwight just listen!  It's underneath...  [Dwight hangs up as the policeman hands him a ticket]
[on phone] Cici has been calling me 'Pamela'. Like four times this week.
I cannot wait for that joke to be over.
Oh, no, Kevin, it���s not a joke. Angela���s husband put me up for a-- um, just never mind.
Well, I can't really imagine you yelling at anyone.
Yes, but David Wallace does. And he asked me to gather everyone to talk about stuff... That's gonna be revealed once we're in the conference room for the meeting.
You can tell Michael that I'm not leaving.
Um, hey, Darryl, listen, it's none of my business, but if I couldn't have Cece for Christmas, I'd be really upset too.
Oh my God, I win!  Ok, it was a minor league hockey game. He brought his brother, and when I went to the bathroom, the game ended and they forgot about me.
[leans over toward Erin] Um, hit the speakerphone button. The speakerphone button? The same button as you hit before... or sit on it.
Hi dad. Yeah Jim has shaving cream, check our bathroom.
Or I could come back as your personal assistant. You know? Sort your mail, set your appointments. I know all the people.
Do we know anyone who was in the accident?
No, I���m familiar with spinning. It���s just that wouldn���t work with a chore wheel because people might get the same chore-
[shouts] Michael Scott, are you still seeing Donna?
Michael, I think that as the boss you should really---
[whispering] Um, I���m sorry. I have to go. My daughter���s a ladybug. I know that doesn���t make any sense. Um, thank you, thank you.
Well, I mean, the only reason he doesn't is because I'm breastfeeding, and Phillip doesn't like a bottle.
And we know how he died.  Flying into the glass doors.  But you know what?  I don't think he was being stupid.  I think he just really, really wanted to come inside our building to spread his cheer and lift our spirits with a song.
I didn't see where it started but I saw where it ended.
How are you Tom. Nice to see you.
You're gonna give yourself a bonus of $645 instead of getting the entire office something it really needs?
All right. You can go. Give him his gum.
[talking head with Jim] It's clear why we were trying not to tell people. That's clear now. [Jim nods, looking at floor]
Then why isn't he scheming? Or preparing to avenge?
[telephone rings] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Hold please.
When it comes down to it, it's a health issue.  I should have written that.
I'm saying we should go scorched earth on that guy's face.
Um, Fargo, um, Edward Scissorhands, Dazed and Confused...
Yeah, the um, the city commissioned me to do the-
I thought it was weird when you picked us to make a documentary. But all in all���I think an ordinary paper company like Dunder Mifflin was a great subject for a documentary. There���s a lot of beauty in ordinary things. Isn���t that kind of the point?
[trying to sleep as the baby cries]  Jim, Jim, get her.
We're all in it, from like years and years ago. It's like a home movie.
I'm still not sure why this woman is even here.
A little smile and a nod shows that I hear you. Got it?
[Reading Jim's palm] You're major and minor lines cross at a ridge - that sucks.
You know, I changed a tire today. All by myself. This bathrobe's already coming in handy. [Meredith honking] Coming!
[Dwight hands out handkerchief] Thanks. You don't need to stay here.
[to Michael] Oh, would that make you feel better?
[seeing Jim come in with Cece wearing an old t-shirt] What?
[sees Ryan coming through door] Hey Ryan. Welcome back --
Wait, are you saying that into the phone or are you saying that to me.
I literally cannot wait to see what Dwight has planned.  And I wish Jim were here.
There is no rush to get to the hospital.  I am fine.  I'll get there.  And if I don't get there, I don't get there.
We couldn't do it without you, so we postponed.
And he wanted Jim to be a part of it too.
Jim's been spending a few days a week in Philly and I'm not gonna lie, it's been challenging. Yesterday, things took a turn for the worse. I found out Cece has lice. So I was up all night disinfecting every sheet, towel, toy, item of clothing in the entire house. I'm exhausted. But don't tell Jim. He has a huge meeting today, under a lot of pressure and he's doing it all for the family.
He finally has a story everyone wants to hear... and he knows it.
I only have one goal today. To make one kid like me. Just one.
I don't often miss Roy. But I can tell you one thing. I wish someone had flashed me when I was with Roy. Because that would have been the ass-kicking of the year. [small laugh] Especially if it had been Jim. He would not have wanted me to have seen Jim's... Whoo, I am... I am saying a lot of things.
[reading from paper] Can you make that straighter? That job looks hard. You should put your mouth on that. How can you even use that one naturally?
We don't normally download films illegally.  Because we're honest,  hardworking people.
Michael, 5k means 5 kilometers, not 5 thousand miles. [knocks]
I love you so much. [starting to cry]
And we'll make sure Dwight doesn't do anything C-R-A-Z-Y.
I���m an oncologist and you are a dog.
Well what was I supposed to do, let you walk all over me?
You know what, I think we should get some other input.
I acknowledge with gratitude that you are being kind and responsible enough to include it in your calendar.
It's weird. Jan use to treat Michael like he was a ten year old, but lately it's like he's five.
I love [leans over Michael's desk to look at his computer screen]... this idea is neat. I've never been. It sounds lovely. [meanwhile Michael looks at the pictures Pam printed out]
I thought it might be fun to set her up with someone. Any ideas?
I think I should hire them all. Do like Lollapalooza.
[On phone] Oh, OK. No problem. Thanks. Hey guys, WPTU called.  The interview's off. They're opening a new cupcake store at the Steamtown Mall and Iris wants to cover that, so...
What are you talking about? Yes we can.
Ladies and gentlemen, I think we have a winner.
I know.  And how long is CJ gonna spin this whole MS thing?  How can Josh and Sam keep quiet?
OK. I'm gonna be a few minutes. So it's only twenty past five. I still have to do my faxes.
Ladies, are we prepared to let the Kevins of the world decide anything for us? Anything at all? We don't even give him full internet access.
The architecture reminds one of a quaint Tuscan beet farm.
[on the phone] No, no, I know that the warranty's expired, but isn't it supposed to last longer than two years if it isn't defective? OK, fine, three years.
Yes, I have been working with you forever.
What's it like without my glasses?  Um, well, here, I'll show you.  Unfocus your lens.  A lot.  I'm 20/400.  You got it?  Okay, I'm gonna spend the rest of the day like this.  I can't see any of the things that would bother me on a normal day.  I can't see anything disgusting, or ugly, or Michael... it's great.
Or you proved that he thinks you're gay.
I spent a month putting that rolodex on his Blackberry, which he now uses as a nightlight.
Yup! [Tom and Pete give Halpertian looks to camera]
[Pam's car pulls out of parking lot and then off to the side of the road] I told you I'm not dating anyone. And even if I was, I don't think it's anyone's business. I mean, when I do fall in love, like when it's for real, the last person I'm gonna talk about it too is a camera crew, or my co-workers. [Jim gets into the passenger side] Almost marrying Roy Anderson was as close to Pamela Anderson as I ever want to be. [Jim leans over and kisses Pam] Trust me, when I fall in love, you'll know.
Okay, which one of these looks more right? [holds up drawing of Stanley with and without a moustache]
Oh, hey, Jim. Wait, stop. Um, I'm sorry... for pushing you towards Cumberland. Seriously, if you left here, I would blow my brains out.
Okay. Okay, here. Okay, so the next time he goes to the bathroom, I���ll distract him, you take that.
Oh Angela, those brownies have walnuts in them and I think Kevin's allergic to walnuts. You're allergic to walnuts, right Kevin?
Maybe it's because you spent the whole year flirting with the receptionist.
Everything is fine.  You don't have to worry.  Try not to think about it.  She's not coming out for a while, okay?
We were supposed to go to the barbeque at Jim's house.
They're considering him for a top secret mission. There's his application. Oh, and this is where I made him list every secret he promised he'd never ever tell.
What possible explanation could you have for possibly being here? I don't... you know, babies shouldn't have ice cream, by the way.
Yeah... [they see Erin eating in her car, and ducking when they see her. Pam knocks on her car window] Hey, Erin, everything okay?
Oh, um, well, you know, I��� I just��� I just think I would rather keep that private. You know, if you���d been filmed for nine years of your life, there���d be some things that you just wanna keep to yourself.
When I get eight hours, compared to like six hours, like, big difference.
You know, when Holly gets back, everyone will tell her what a great job you did. And then she'll realize what she's missing.
One is tall and brunette, and the other one is short, and blonde, and perky, and kinda judgmental.  Who do you think he should choose?
Well I'm having my baby first, so that's that.
That's a sad story. I have another one. We move, the other tenants follow, the bank takes the building, takes your farm, takes your car and beats the crap out of you. Penniless, you die, and my daughter Cece dances on your grave... fully clothed. [lights turn off, Pam and Dwight begin to wave their arms to alert the sensor]
Just a subway stop away are the best museums in the world.
I feel good. [sees a huge pile of French toast] Wow.
You know Oscar every time I make this lasagna people ask me if it's a family recipe, but really, I just get the recipe from the box!
Here's what we think happened.  Michael's sidekick, who all through the movie is this complete idiot who's causing the downfall of the United States, was originally named Dwight.  But then Michael changed it to Samuel L. Chang using a search and replace, but that doesn't work on misspelled words, leaving behind one Dwigt.  And Dwight figured it out.  Oops.
Great. I am killing it over here. [drops mayonnaise on the ground] Jim, I gotta go.
I kind of forced you to do it.
Why did I get in the car?  I could of struggled.  I have a whistle in my purse I didn't even blow it.
How can you give us performance reviews if you don't know us?
For the record? Not on board with fake Stanley... although, I get it.
If you���re an artist, you have to be okay with the idea ��that you can���t please everybody all the time.
Ok. I was thinking about wearing it down. Kind of like, I don't know, like loose with big curls and...
What is it? [Jim lifts the hog maw with a fork] Don't touch it.
There's some filing, restocking the supply shelves. Replacing the water jug, which nobody likes to do. Um, we... uh, eat a lot of cake!
I'm sorry, can we just hurry this up? I've got a game to get back to.
[telephone ringing] Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. Hold, please. Dwight, it's the Sheriff. He said that it's really important. It's regarding your desk. I'll transfer.
Hey, Oscar, come here. Oscar, this is Matt, and um, Matt loves your pate.
[on the phone] Michael, it's Ryan for you.
Michael, do you remember, you specifically told me to only bring one sheet of paper? You said it only takes one sheet to make a difference. And I said, 'Are you sure Michael?' And you said 'Pam! Pam! Pam!' And then you sneezed in my tea, and then you said, 'Don't worry, it's just allergies.' Do you remember that?
Thank you. [goes to Michael's office and knocks on the door]
I'm sure it's fine. it's a blue shirt.
Why would I love that? Can we afford a delivery guy?
Well we all wanted to plan your goodbye party. We thought this would be easier.
[with five popcorn bags left] Anyone else?  Nooo.
Who cares? [Michael peeking at them through his office window] It's not that huge a sale.
Kevin, at most you���re saving a microscopic amount of time.
Is there a volume knob on that thing?
Hey. You know I was engaged before Jim.
Okay, just so you know, it's just the students from my class in a little studio.
Oh, okay. Everyone, remember, when he get's like this, he will wallow, if you empathize. Keep conversations light and if you get stuck, and you don't know what to do, make a random sound effect okay? Farting noise, whatever. Okay.
Jim is a great guy. He's like a brother to me.  We're like best friends in the office and I really hope he finds someone.
Hey guys, we're all gonna visit Meredith at lunch. And we're kicking in $5 for flowers.
Uh, that is Creed Bratton. He has four toes and he fought in the Civil war.
[talks over flashbacks] Kelly has been a handful in the past.
Police are a hassle. We settled this on the street.
Somebody did something bad to Michael's carpet. Maybe that's all we need to know.
Yes.  And I think they gave him too many fries.
Okay, I'm not going.  I'm not...  It's fine.   [Jim, Michael and Kevin try to help her up] Okay, come on, come on.  No!  I am not going!  I am not going, okay!?  I'm not going today because I can't do it, I don't think I can do it.
Well, looks like he really did just want to talk about the issues. i'm Sorry Oscar.
Hey!  This is not half-way!  I did the math.  I had to drive way longer than you.  Montclair would have been closer, so you have to buy lunch.
And Jim's mom suggested that Jim spend time hanging with the kids in his reading group, because she though that would be a good influence.
Just don't talk about the email, okay? He's gonna cancel it on his own, I really think he will.
So um, I've been thinking about this whole chair/copier thing...
[reads memo] 'Sleeves down to the wrists, buttoned-up collars, and muted colors.' Nobody dress like that. [camera pans over to Angela]
Oscar thinks that having a dog is just like having a baby.
I called the doctor like a week ago.  I couldn't wait...  Oh, God, don't be mad.
We stole Dwight's trashcan and she found some of his early attempts at his sign.
Oh... come on, bear man. Come on. [the lights flicker]
Oh my gosh. The honeymoon was great. We met this other couple at the resort, Frank and Benny. We hung out with them a lot.
Okay, first, work out. And, hey! Look! You did that. Check. [Michael doing leg lifts] Eat an enormous breakfast. Check.
Whoa, Toby.  Watch out.  You're going to violate your own PDA memo.
I used to be young and cute and sorta funny and I could do those cute, little cartoons. And everyone who came through here was like, ���Who���s that receptionist? I like her.��� Now I���m just a fat mom. Yeah, and you take one look at me and you���re like, ���Oh, loser.���
Hey, Michael. [Michael is sitting on couch outside his office] How you doing?
Is it because of Michael? Did he actually do something?
I'm a woman. I would want to know.
I just mean because you know us and you like observed us for ten years and I feel like he's- I just feel like...he's so into his work right now and....I don't know, am I crazy?
How could I have thought that? How could I have thought that?
Let's grab some ice cream, go back to the office, and finish what we started. [others nod in agreement]
And get your flu shot. Also, I'm going to set up hand sanitizing stations around the office.
Oh I can help starting dinner if you need it.
You know, I never did it, but for your 30th birthday I really wanted to surprise you with-
The unfair thing about working in sales is that your salary is almost all commission. So, you suck at sales, you make almost no money. I guess that's fair.
OK, well, why are you laying like that?
I find that hard to believe... considering you have problems with every single person in this entire office except Bobblehead Joe.
What? [opens her eyes, Michael is standing over her] Oh...
Well, I'm not an artist, and I'm not a salesman. So what would you call it?
[looking at pile on Michel's carpet] Oh... I don't know.
[phone rings, Pam answers] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.  Just one moment, I'll transfer you.
Yeah. I mean, listen if we���re gonna do this thing, we should do it right.
Here here! Speech, speech, speech, speech [other people start joining in]
I'm sorry. It's just, uhm, I actually do have this weird feeling that there���s something Jim isn't telling me.
No. He just keeps letting all the calls go to voicemail.
Dwight, listen to me. Businesswomen are just normal, nice, reasonable people. Who is a nice, reasonable person in your experience?
Oh Jim, I don't think you're going to abandon this party here all by itself.
You know what? I'm gonna get a hose. Then we'll talk about it. Ok we'll figure it out. Be right back. Just stay there.
Wait, um, does anyone remember when it was set up?
Yeah.  Don't fall asleep at your desk.  [Turning towards the vending machine] Oh my God.
After you talked, he called my mom and said he was gonna look for an apartment.
I just drove twenty miles round-trip back to the office to get Michael a single sheet of white paper. So, I could have just had them fax it to me, I guess.
[on phone] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh hi, David. He's having a colonoscopy. Alright, I'll find out if he's out yet.
Thank you.  Um, listen I just wanted to confirm that you're not coming to the wedding, which is totally understandable and more than fine.
Okay. Put everything back exactly how you found it.
Besides, we have something those other people don't have, which is a home and a bed.
Phyllis, if you could switch to a different soap, just for a month or two? Yours is kind of perfumy.
Say that I'm lying or say that I have the job. Make a definitive statement, Gabe.
No no no, I want to see more of Philly Jim. I want Philly Jim.
Because I got it at Blockbuster and they don't put the pictures on the box.
Why is there a circle with a line through it?
I could tell Jo... or I could tell Michael.
Uhh, huh, ho... oooh my God, you are ridiculous!
No, not like a ham. It's about doing something, so that the person knows that you really care about her.
Yes, Michael, new chairs. These chairs are terrible. We were supposed to get new ones last year.
I didn���t watch the whole documentary. After a few episodes, it was too painful. I kept wanting to scream at Pam. It took me so long to do so many important things. It���s just hard to accept that I spent so many years being less happy than I could have been. Jim was 5 feet from my desk and it took me four years to get to him. It���d be great if people saw this documentary and learned from my mistakes. Not that I���m a tragic person. I���m really happy now. But���it would just���just make my heart soar if someone out there saw this and she said to herself ���be strong, trust yourself, love yourself. Conquer your fears. Just go after what you want and act fast, because life just isn���t that long.���
They���re the ones who put a fish tank next to a basketball hoop. It���s like if I put a glass of milk on the edge of the table and Cece knocks it over, I don���t blame Cece.
So Jim and I are getting married and the wedding's really expensive.  So I tried to get a job on the weekends to earn extra money.  I applied to Old Navy, Target and Wal-mart.  None of 'em called me back.  Not even for an interview.
I mean, it's not a big deal, but I think a lot of people from the office will be there.
I'm just gonna sit here for a little bit longer if that's okay. The air smells so good. I don't remember it smelling so good. The chairs are so comfortable.
Toby, was this your fun little way of congratulating us?
It's impractical. I'm not going to try to get a house like that. Um... they don't even make houses like that in Scranton. So, I'm never going to... .
[laughs] I don't know. I think Michael has a date.
Well in your fantasy we're Stephen King characters.
I'm not saying she's in love with him. But she could have left a while ago. Most printer sales are done over the phone, Ms. Boob shirt.
Ok [squeaking sound] Oh that was just me. Pregnant Pam. And I make sounds much worse than this.
Whoa! Hey! That is not OK. What are you gonna do about that?
Oh, wow. I forgot how pretty your house is.
You know, Angela, you don't have to come to the wedding.
Maybe, because it doesn't seem to be going super well.
Do you have any leads on a job?
Mm. [walks into bathroom, Meredith is using her brest pump] Meredith!
Oh, hey Michael! I'm just going to go to Carbondale to price some shredders. I'll see you later.
Every time Michael's in a meeting, he makes me come in and give him a Post-It note telling him who's on the phone. I did it once, and he freaked out. He loved it so much. The thing is he doesn't get that many calls. So he has me make them up every 10 minutes.
Hi. [they kiss] Mmm. 'Cause-- [looks toward camera]
And then, out of that cake, pops another stripper holding a smaller cake. And then an even smaller stripper pops out of that one.
Try paperclips. Oh wait. This message. For Dwight.
Apparently Michael has come up with a Dunder Mifflin Mad Lib, and he's making us play it with him. We are so happy. No. I'd like to choose a different adjective.
Brake lights. Break lights! Break lights! Break lights!!!
Dwight!  Go to my house.  Get my iPod.  I think it's on the kitchen table.  Do not touch anything else.  The key is under...
I'm sorry to interrupt you. Um, I actually have something very important to talk to you about, business related.
Tell him you'd like to go with him.
[answering the phone] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. I'm sorry, he's not in yet. Would you like his voicemail?
What's the rule about eating when people are in the bathroom?
So we basically had no privacy for ten years.
Well, Dwight had this idea, and I thought it was kind of crazy. But maybe that's where we are now.
Okay. I'll go look for another one. [she leaves]
One of the simplest ways to cut down on the spread of germs is to use something called the vampire cough.
W.B. Jones is renovating their offices and their construction crews are taking up some of the parking spaces we used to get.
[hesitates] I am. I am the office administrator!
[loading up car with Michael] Don't look up. Don't look up. [sighs as office workers all looking from window]
Just because someone likes things clean, doesn't mean they're rich.
That means another twelve weeks.  [pause] Can you do this for another three months?
I just, uh, thought you'd want to know that.
If you don't take out his battery, he just keeps going all day.
Because I���m so glad you���re back, baby, but I���m just���I was talking to Darryl, and he was talking about the trip, and I just feel like you���re giving up so much.
And I guarantee, that you will be satisfied! 'Cause your satisfaction is our guarantee! We guarantee it. We look forward to doing business with you too. Thank you Russell.
Oh... is there another wedding at the hotel this weekend?
Wow. Your voice is as lovely as ever.
Jan used to be one of my superiors, and she is one of the most erratic and terrifying people I have ever met.
Oh, okay.  Well, Michael wants to see everyone in the conference room. [Jim shakes his head. Seems relieved to be getting away from Kelly] But you know what? We have a few minutes so you guys should definitely finish up your conversation. [Jim nods his head as if to say, 'Gee, thanks, Pam.']
Yes. But John Stamos was temporary. I quickly moved on to-
If I'm being completely honest, I could've done without the belly kiss.
Kelly made me realize something.  She and I have... nothing in common.  And I need more friends.
Fine! [eggs splatter all over his robe] Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm confused. Am I walking down the aisle to 'You Can Call Me Al?'
I can't tell you specifically, but... it's not over.
We have an extra outfit in the bag.
Oh.  I think you should get it.  You've changed a lot and you'd be good at it.
Hey, I would just love to schedule a meeting today with Dwight.
I know, because you're the reason we're moving.
Oh, damn. [Pam looks down at her salad] They've been in there for like ten minutes.
But I'm not kidding.  I really want to do it.
Oh, I can not believe I fell for that. [laughing] Oh, my God.
