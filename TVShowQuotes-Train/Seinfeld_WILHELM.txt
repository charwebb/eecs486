Really? Make sure he signs this. Oh, look George, if there's a problem with Morgan you can tell me.
...when you're done George, and bring it directly to me. Mr Steinbrenner is very interested in this.
(pleased) Well then, I guess you'll be heading downtown then, huh?
Ah, Mr. Steinbrenner, you know, w-we've searched everywhere, th-there's no sign of him. n-n-Not even anyone who remotely fits his description, sir.
(puzzled) Uh, George, uh, did you call some carpet cleaners?
"George, there's nothing I hate more than a liar."
(singing) Meet the Mets, meet the Mets. Come right out and greet the Mets.
Yessir. (he starts backing up to the door.)
Oh, George, have you seen the American league directory? It is a big green book. Oh, thanks kiddo.
George, we just got the final budget numbers. We went over budget on some of the items, but I don't think there's gonna be a problem. (hands over the budget file to a very annoyed George) I'll let you get back to work, George. (Mr. Wilhelm leaves the office)
Oh yes sir, good morning, good morning, sir.
And you can tell the players that I reimburse the trainer for the cigarettes and the dive checks.
I wanted to get fired. George, you are looking at the new head scout of the New York Mets.
"If anybody here knows anything about it I recommend strongly that...you come forward."
Oh yes, I read through it this morning. I couldn't have done it better myself, and I turned it right over to Mr Steinbrenner. Good work George.
Mr. Steinbrenner, I am very concerned about George Costanza.
(thinks for a moment) That's right. (pause) What's for dinner?
Yes, well I trust things are moving smoothly. Mr Steinbrenner's counting on you, you know.
(proudly, to the man seated beside him) He's my protg.
Now, George, you don't have to cover for him any more. He's going to be gone soon and I'm going to recommend you for his job.
(drying his hands and heading for the door) Yes, George. I want you to make this project a top priority.
Well, what's the problem? Now come on George. I told the big man you were moving on this. Now, don't let him down!
Ha ha ha ha ha, George, keep up the good work.
"You're a terrible liar George. Look at you, you're a wreck!. you're sweating bullets."
Wow! What an, Entrance! (friendly, to George) And eh, who might this be?
"I called this meeting because we......have........a problem. For the last few months someone has been stealing equipment from the club. Until recently it's been little things, y'know; bases, batting helmets, donuts, but two nights ago they pulled the big one. "
No, no. No, no, sir. I ordered George to drive around insulting people today. Because I'm tired of all your macho head games.
Well, I'm very interested to see how this thing turns out.
I still want to know what happened to that birthday card? Now, Morgan, did you ever sign it?
Wilhelm? (he raises the nozzle of his cleaner) My name is Tanya.
Lemme see, I uh, I had an assignment for you... uh.
He's been coming in late all week. Is there something wrong?
The gardener did a nice job planting the rose bushes, didn't he dear?
Yes sir. (he starts backing up to the door.)
George...I think you may be taking work a little too seriously.
George, I'll tell you what I'd like you to do. I, I'd like you to drop everything.
"They took a pitching machine, a batting cage ,the in-field tarp and all of Mr Steinbrenner's vitamins.. Now , we have reasons to believe it's an inside job."
(from behind the closed door in the hallway)Yes sir.
(from behind the closed door in the hallway) Yes Sir!
I have this... fun little assignment I think you'll enjoy. There's some reps in from the Houston Astros for talks on that interleague play... and I want you to show them a good time.(George acts like "ok, you're the boss")
"So George. Have you heard anything about the missing equipment?"
Wait, wait, Mr Steinbrenner. George doesn't deserve any of the blame for what happened in the parking lot today, sir. If there's anyone to blame here, it's me.
Look, sorry doesn't cut it. We're running a ball club here George. You've got to pay attention.
Oh no, you've got to go downtown, George. It's all downtown. Just like the song says.
(puts arm round George's shoulder) He's just being loyal to me, sir.
I'm sorry to interrupt you, but Mr. Steinbrenner and I really want you to know we appreciate all the hours you've been putting in Oh, and, ah, confidentially, Sozonkel, our Assistant to the General Manger, hasn't really been working out. And the boss thinks you're the man for the job! So, keep it under your hat!
The trainer, George. Tell the players I'll reimburse the trainer. What's the matter with you? This is the third time I've had to repeat myself.
