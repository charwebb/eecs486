Now, George, you don't have to cover for him any more. He's going to be gone soon and I'm going to recommend you for his job.
"I called this meeting because we......have........a problem. For the last few months someone has been stealing equipment from the club. Until recently it's been little things, y'know; bases, batting helmets, donuts, but two nights ago they pulled the big one. "
(singing) Meet the Mets, meet the Mets. Come right out and greet the Mets.
George, this is beautiful. Why didn't you tell me you were going to have it mounted like this?
I'm sorry to interrupt you, but Mr. Steinbrenner and I really want you to know we appreciate all the hours you've been putting in Oh, and, ah, confidentially, Sozonkel, our Assistant to the General Manger, hasn't really been working out. And the boss thinks you're the man for the job! So, keep it under your hat!
I'm here to clean the carpets. Most of the world is carpeted. And, one day, we will do the cleaning.
(thinks for a moment) That's right. (pause) What's for dinner?
Yessir. (he starts backing up to the door.)
The trainer, George. Tell the players I'll reimburse the trainer. What's the matter with you? This is the third time I've had to repeat myself.
George, I'll tell you what I'd like you to do. I, I'd like you to drop everything.
Well, I'm very interested to see how this thing turns out.
"So George. Have you heard anything about the missing equipment?"
...when you're done George, and bring it directly to me. Mr Steinbrenner is very interested in this.
Wow! What an, Entrance! (friendly, to George) And eh, who might this be?
Oh yes sir, good morning, good morning, sir.
Lemme see, I uh, I had an assignment for you... uh.
Well, what's the problem? Now come on George. I told the big man you were moving on this. Now, don't let him down!
That's what I came to talk to you about. Great job George. (shakes George's hand) You really nailed it.
I have this... fun little assignment I think you'll enjoy. There's some reps in from the Houston Astros for talks on that interleague play... and I want you to show them a good time.(George acts like "ok, you're the boss")
(pleased) Well then, I guess you'll be heading downtown then, huh?
Ha ha ha ha ha, George, keep up the good work.
Oh yes, I read through it this morning. I couldn't have done it better myself, and I turned it right over to Mr Steinbrenner. Good work George.
No, no. No, no, sir. I ordered George to drive around insulting people today. Because I'm tired of all your macho head games.
George, we just got the final budget numbers. We went over budget on some of the items, but I don't think there's gonna be a problem. (hands over the budget file to a very annoyed George) I'll let you get back to work, George. (Mr. Wilhelm leaves the office)
Oh, George, have you seen the American league directory? It is a big green book. Oh, thanks kiddo.
Oh no, you've got to go downtown, George. It's all downtown. Just like the song says.
He's been coming in late all week. Is there something wrong?
Look, sorry doesn't cut it. We're running a ball club here George. You've got to pay attention.
No no no sir. Well, you see, I don't think--
The gardener did a nice job planting the rose bushes, didn't he dear?
Yes, well I trust things are moving smoothly. Mr Steinbrenner's counting on you, you know.
Mr. Steinbrenner, I am very concerned about George Costanza.
And you can tell the players that I reimburse the trainer for the cigarettes and the dive checks.
I still want to know what happened to that birthday card? Now, Morgan, did you ever sign it?
Yes sir. (he starts backing up to the door.)
(puts arm round George's shoulder) He's just being loyal to me, sir.
Ah, Mr. Steinbrenner, you know, w-we've searched everywhere, th-there's no sign of him. n-n-Not even anyone who remotely fits his description, sir.
(puzzled) Uh, George, uh, did you call some carpet cleaners?
(drying his hands and heading for the door) Yes, George. I want you to make this project a top priority.
(from behind the closed door in the hallway) Yes Sir!
"You're a terrible liar George. Look at you, you're a wreck!. you're sweating bullets."
"They took a pitching machine, a batting cage ,the in-field tarp and all of Mr Steinbrenner's vitamins.. Now , we have reasons to believe it's an inside job."
Really? Make sure he signs this. Oh, look George, if there's a problem with Morgan you can tell me.
Wilhelm? (he raises the nozzle of his cleaner) My name is Tanya.
(from behind the closed door in the hallway)Yes sir.
"If anybody here knows anything about it I recommend strongly that...you come forward."
"George, there's nothing I hate more than a liar."
