"You look a little warm."
No, He's late.
There's your answer. Downtown.
You mean you haven't been to payroll?
What's the matter with you?!
(drying his hands and heading for the door) Yes, George. I want you to make this project a top priority.
What's this?
Lemme think here.
Look, sorry doesn't cut it. We're running a ball club here George. You've got to pay attention.
Wow! What an, Entrance! (friendly, to George) And eh, who might this be?
(exiting) Top priority.
Really? Make sure he signs this. Oh, look George, if there's a problem with Morgan you can tell me.
Ah, Mr. Steinbrenner, you know, w-we've searched everywhere, th-there's no sign of him. n-n-Not even anyone who remotely fits his description, sir.
Yessir?
Lemme see, I uh, I had an assignment for you... uh.
Yes Sir! (closes the door)
I'm sorry to interrupt you, but Mr. Steinbrenner and I really want you to know we appreciate all the hours you've been putting in Oh, and, ah, confidentially, Sozonkel, our Assistant to the General Manger, hasn't really been working out. And the boss thinks you're the man for the job! So, keep it under your hat!
George. (waves George over) George.
(entering the office) Yes George.
(proudly, to the man seated beside him) He's my protg.
(confusion) Get started? I don't understand, George.
Yessir. (he starts backing up to the door.)
"They took a pitching machine, a batting cage ,the in-field tarp and all of Mr Steinbrenner's vitamins.. Now , we have reasons to believe it's an inside job."
"George, there's nothing I hate more than a liar."
Wilhelm? (he raises the nozzle of his cleaner) My name is Tanya.
Oh. Ah-ha..
The trainer, George. Tell the players I'll reimburse the trainer. What's the matter with you? This is the third time I've had to repeat myself.
Ha ha ha ha ha, George, keep up the good work.
I did?
(from behind the closed door in the hallway)Yes sir.
I understand.
(puts arm round George's shoulder) He's just being loyal to me, sir.
George, we just got the final budget numbers. We went over budget on some of the items, but I don't think there's gonna be a problem. (hands over the budget file to a very annoyed George) I'll let you get back to work, George. (Mr. Wilhelm leaves the office)
Mr. Steinbrenner, I am very concerned about George Costanza.
Well, I'm very interested to see how this thing turns out.
Well, what's the problem? Now come on George. I told the big man you were moving on this. Now, don't let him down!
"You're a terrible liar George. Look at you, you're a wreck!. you're sweating bullets."
"I called this meeting because we......have........a problem. For the last few months someone has been stealing equipment from the club. Until recently it's been little things, y'know; bases, batting helmets, donuts, but two nights ago they pulled the big one. "
Parents.
They're in my office, right now.
George...I think you may be taking work a little too seriously.
Uh-a Anyway, his car's in the parking lot, the front end is bashed in, and there's blood in the car, and we can't find him anywhere. Obviously he was in some sort of a terrible car accident, and trooper that he is, he tried to make it into work, sir.
He's been coming in late all week. Is there something wrong?
Oh, George, have you seen the American league directory? It is a big green book. Oh, thanks kiddo.
George! George, get a hold of yourself!
Yes sir.
...when you're done George, and bring it directly to me. Mr Steinbrenner is very interested in this.
"So George. Have you heard anything about the missing equipment?"
George, I'll tell you what I'd like you to do. I, I'd like you to drop everything.
George, this is beautiful. Why didn't you tell me you were going to have it mounted like this?
"Are you feeling all right George?"
George!?
"If anybody here knows anything about it I recommend strongly that...you come forward."
Right. Yessir.
(puzzled) Uh, George, uh, did you call some carpet cleaners?
Oh no, you've got to go downtown, George. It's all downtown. Just like the song says.
Oh yes sir, good morning, good morning, sir.
So...
Wait, wait, Mr Steinbrenner. George doesn't deserve any of the blame for what happened in the parking lot today, sir. If there's anyone to blame here, it's me.
Oh yes, I read through it this morning. I couldn't have done it better myself, and I turned it right over to Mr Steinbrenner. Good work George.
And you can tell the players that I reimburse the trainer for the cigarettes and the dive checks.
...did you go down to payroll?
Yes sir, yes sir. (Opening the door)
(from behind the closed door in the hallway) Yes Sir!
Have you seen Morgan?
No, no. No, no, sir. I ordered George to drive around insulting people today. Because I'm tired of all your macho head games.
What, sir?
I have this... fun little assignment I think you'll enjoy. There's some reps in from the Houston Astros for talks on that interleague play... and I want you to show them a good time.(George acts like "ok, you're the boss")
Morning George.
Yes, well I trust things are moving smoothly. Mr Steinbrenner's counting on you, you know.
I'm here to clean the carpets. Most of the world is carpeted. And, one day, we will do the cleaning.
George, have you seen Morgan?
(thinks for a moment) That's right. (pause) What's for dinner?
Isn't that Babe Ruth's uniform?
About what?
I still want to know what happened to that birthday card? Now, Morgan, did you ever sign it?
