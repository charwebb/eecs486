(drying his hands and heading for the door) Yes, George. I want you to make this project a top priority.
(puts arm round George's shoulder) He's just being loyal to me, sir.
Wow! What an, Entrance! (friendly, to George) And eh, who might this be?
About what?
Yes sir. (he starts backing up to the door.)
That's what I came to talk to you about. Great job George. (shakes George's hand) You really nailed it.
(proudly, to the man seated beside him) He's my protg.
I still want to know what happened to that birthday card? Now, Morgan, did you ever sign it?
Oh yes, I read through it this morning. I couldn't have done it better myself, and I turned it right over to Mr Steinbrenner. Good work George.
George...I think you may be taking work a little too seriously.
They're in my office, right now.
He's been coming in late all week. Is there something wrong?
Lemme think here.
Oh no, you've got to go downtown, George. It's all downtown. Just like the song says.
I wanted to get fired. George, you are looking at the new head scout of the New York Mets.
Right. Yessir.
Ha ha ha ha ha, George, keep up the good work.
"If anybody here knows anything about it I recommend strongly that...you come forward."
Yes Sir! (closes the door)
Yes sir.
George. (waves George over) George.
Yes, well I trust things are moving smoothly. Mr Steinbrenner's counting on you, you know.
So...
(entering the office) Yes George.
Oh. Ah-ha..
Well, I'm very interested to see how this thing turns out.
Have you seen Morgan?
No, He's late.
George, this is beautiful. Why didn't you tell me you were going to have it mounted like this?
The gardener did a nice job planting the rose bushes, didn't he dear?
There's your answer. Downtown.
(from behind the closed door in the hallway)Yes sir.
And you can tell the players that I reimburse the trainer for the cigarettes and the dive checks.
Mr. Steinbrenner, I am very concerned about George Costanza.
Yes sir, yes sir. (Opening the door)
What's this?
Morning George.
George, I'll tell you what I'd like you to do. I, I'd like you to drop everything.
I have this... fun little assignment I think you'll enjoy. There's some reps in from the Houston Astros for talks on that interleague play... and I want you to show them a good time.(George acts like "ok, you're the boss")
Lemme see, I uh, I had an assignment for you... uh.
Wilhelm? (he raises the nozzle of his cleaner) My name is Tanya.
"George, there's nothing I hate more than a liar."
"So George. Have you heard anything about the missing equipment?"
I'm here to clean the carpets. Most of the world is carpeted. And, one day, we will do the cleaning.
Look, sorry doesn't cut it. We're running a ball club here George. You've got to pay attention.
Oh, George, have you seen the American league directory? It is a big green book. Oh, thanks kiddo.
Wait, wait, Mr Steinbrenner. George doesn't deserve any of the blame for what happened in the parking lot today, sir. If there's anyone to blame here, it's me.
(thinks for a moment) That's right. (pause) What's for dinner?
George!?
Oh yes sir, good morning, good morning, sir.
(puzzled) Uh, George, uh, did you call some carpet cleaners?
Uh-a Anyway, his car's in the parking lot, the front end is bashed in, and there's blood in the car, and we can't find him anywhere. Obviously he was in some sort of a terrible car accident, and trooper that he is, he tried to make it into work, sir.
You mean you haven't been to payroll?
...when you're done George, and bring it directly to me. Mr Steinbrenner is very interested in this.
I'm sorry to interrupt you, but Mr. Steinbrenner and I really want you to know we appreciate all the hours you've been putting in Oh, and, ah, confidentially, Sozonkel, our Assistant to the General Manger, hasn't really been working out. And the boss thinks you're the man for the job! So, keep it under your hat!
(singing) Meet the Mets, meet the Mets. Come right out and greet the Mets.
Isn't that Babe Ruth's uniform?
"You're a terrible liar George. Look at you, you're a wreck!. you're sweating bullets."
Really? Make sure he signs this. Oh, look George, if there's a problem with Morgan you can tell me.
(pleased) Well then, I guess you'll be heading downtown then, huh?
What, sir?
George, have you seen Morgan?
"You look a little warm."
"They took a pitching machine, a batting cage ,the in-field tarp and all of Mr Steinbrenner's vitamins.. Now , we have reasons to believe it's an inside job."
George! George, get a hold of yourself!
"I called this meeting because we......have........a problem. For the last few months someone has been stealing equipment from the club. Until recently it's been little things, y'know; bases, batting helmets, donuts, but two nights ago they pulled the big one. "
(exiting) Top priority.
George, we just got the final budget numbers. We went over budget on some of the items, but I don't think there's gonna be a problem. (hands over the budget file to a very annoyed George) I'll let you get back to work, George. (Mr. Wilhelm leaves the office)
"Are you feeling all right George?"
Yessir. (he starts backing up to the door.)
I understand.
Parents.
Well, what's the problem? Now come on George. I told the big man you were moving on this. Now, don't let him down!
Yessir?
No, no. No, no, sir. I ordered George to drive around insulting people today. Because I'm tired of all your macho head games.
I did?
