Yes, well I trust things are moving smoothly. Mr Steinbrenner's counting on you, you know.
Wilhelm? (he raises the nozzle of his cleaner) My name is Tanya.
Mr. Steinbrenner, I am very concerned about George Costanza.
I still want to know what happened to that birthday card? Now, Morgan, did you ever sign it?
Really? Make sure he signs this. Oh, look George, if there's a problem with Morgan you can tell me.
He's been coming in late all week. Is there something wrong?
The gardener did a nice job planting the rose bushes, didn't he dear?
George...I think you may be taking work a little too seriously.
(puts arm round George's shoulder) He's just being loyal to me, sir.
George, we just got the final budget numbers. We went over budget on some of the items, but I don't think there's gonna be a problem. (hands over the budget file to a very annoyed George) I'll let you get back to work, George. (Mr. Wilhelm leaves the office)
Uh-a Anyway, his car's in the parking lot, the front end is bashed in, and there's blood in the car, and we can't find him anywhere. Obviously he was in some sort of a terrible car accident, and trooper that he is, he tried to make it into work, sir.
Oh yes, I read through it this morning. I couldn't have done it better myself, and I turned it right over to Mr Steinbrenner. Good work George.
That's what I came to talk to you about. Great job George. (shakes George's hand) You really nailed it.
Oh, George, have you seen the American league directory? It is a big green book. Oh, thanks kiddo.
(singing) Meet the Mets, meet the Mets. Come right out and greet the Mets.
The trainer, George. Tell the players I'll reimburse the trainer. What's the matter with you? This is the third time I've had to repeat myself.
"So George. Have you heard anything about the missing equipment?"
Oh yes sir, good morning, good morning, sir.
"You're a terrible liar George. Look at you, you're a wreck!. you're sweating bullets."
(from behind the closed door in the hallway)Yes sir.
Now, George, you don't have to cover for him any more. He's going to be gone soon and I'm going to recommend you for his job.
I have this... fun little assignment I think you'll enjoy. There's some reps in from the Houston Astros for talks on that interleague play... and I want you to show them a good time.(George acts like "ok, you're the boss")
...when you're done George, and bring it directly to me. Mr Steinbrenner is very interested in this.
I'm sorry to interrupt you, but Mr. Steinbrenner and I really want you to know we appreciate all the hours you've been putting in Oh, and, ah, confidentially, Sozonkel, our Assistant to the General Manger, hasn't really been working out. And the boss thinks you're the man for the job! So, keep it under your hat!
Ah, Mr. Steinbrenner, you know, w-we've searched everywhere, th-there's no sign of him. n-n-Not even anyone who remotely fits his description, sir.
I'm here to clean the carpets. Most of the world is carpeted. And, one day, we will do the cleaning.
No, no. No, no, sir. I ordered George to drive around insulting people today. Because I'm tired of all your macho head games.
"George, there's nothing I hate more than a liar."
Lemme see, I uh, I had an assignment for you... uh.
(drying his hands and heading for the door) Yes, George. I want you to make this project a top priority.
(pleased) Well then, I guess you'll be heading downtown then, huh?
George, I'll tell you what I'd like you to do. I, I'd like you to drop everything.
Look, sorry doesn't cut it. We're running a ball club here George. You've got to pay attention.
(proudly, to the man seated beside him) He's my protg.
Well, what's the problem? Now come on George. I told the big man you were moving on this. Now, don't let him down!
"They took a pitching machine, a batting cage ,the in-field tarp and all of Mr Steinbrenner's vitamins.. Now , we have reasons to believe it's an inside job."
George, this is beautiful. Why didn't you tell me you were going to have it mounted like this?
Wait, wait, Mr Steinbrenner. George doesn't deserve any of the blame for what happened in the parking lot today, sir. If there's anyone to blame here, it's me.
Well, I'm very interested to see how this thing turns out.
Oh no, you've got to go downtown, George. It's all downtown. Just like the song says.
And you can tell the players that I reimburse the trainer for the cigarettes and the dive checks.
Ha ha ha ha ha, George, keep up the good work.
(from behind the closed door in the hallway) Yes Sir!
(puzzled) Uh, George, uh, did you call some carpet cleaners?
Wow! What an, Entrance! (friendly, to George) And eh, who might this be?
Yessir. (he starts backing up to the door.)
"I called this meeting because we......have........a problem. For the last few months someone has been stealing equipment from the club. Until recently it's been little things, y'know; bases, batting helmets, donuts, but two nights ago they pulled the big one. "
