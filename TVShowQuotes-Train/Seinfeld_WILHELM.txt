Yessir. (he starts backing up to the door.)
Well, I'm very interested to see how this thing turns out.
Lemme see, I uh, I had an assignment for you... uh.
Right. Yessir.
What's this?
Yes sir. (he starts backing up to the door.)
"So George. Have you heard anything about the missing equipment?"
The trainer, George. Tell the players I'll reimburse the trainer. What's the matter with you? This is the third time I've had to repeat myself.
Uh-a Anyway, his car's in the parking lot, the front end is bashed in, and there's blood in the car, and we can't find him anywhere. Obviously he was in some sort of a terrible car accident, and trooper that he is, he tried to make it into work, sir.
(from behind the closed door in the hallway)Yes sir.
Yes sir.
Really? Make sure he signs this. Oh, look George, if there's a problem with Morgan you can tell me.
I understand.
You mean you haven't been to payroll?
"They took a pitching machine, a batting cage ,the in-field tarp and all of Mr Steinbrenner's vitamins.. Now , we have reasons to believe it's an inside job."
Well, what's the problem? Now come on George. I told the big man you were moving on this. Now, don't let him down!
George. (waves George over) George.
Oh yes, I read through it this morning. I couldn't have done it better myself, and I turned it right over to Mr Steinbrenner. Good work George.
Wilhelm? (he raises the nozzle of his cleaner) My name is Tanya.
(proudly, to the man seated beside him) He's my protg.
Yes sir, yes sir. (Opening the door)
I'm sorry to interrupt you, but Mr. Steinbrenner and I really want you to know we appreciate all the hours you've been putting in Oh, and, ah, confidentially, Sozonkel, our Assistant to the General Manger, hasn't really been working out. And the boss thinks you're the man for the job! So, keep it under your hat!
George!?
Yessir?
(exiting) Top priority.
Now, George, you don't have to cover for him any more. He's going to be gone soon and I'm going to recommend you for his job.
Oh. Ah-ha..
(from behind the closed door in the hallway) Yes Sir!
And you can tell the players that I reimburse the trainer for the cigarettes and the dive checks.
Yes, well I trust things are moving smoothly. Mr Steinbrenner's counting on you, you know.
What, sir?
"Are you feeling all right George?"
Wait, wait, Mr Steinbrenner. George doesn't deserve any of the blame for what happened in the parking lot today, sir. If there's anyone to blame here, it's me.
What's the matter with you?!
Isn't that Babe Ruth's uniform?
About what?
(confusion) Get started? I don't understand, George.
No no no sir. Well, you see, I don't think--
No, no. No, no, sir. I ordered George to drive around insulting people today. Because I'm tired of all your macho head games.
George...I think you may be taking work a little too seriously.
Lemme think here.
He's been coming in late all week. Is there something wrong?
(pleased) Well then, I guess you'll be heading downtown then, huh?
George, we just got the final budget numbers. We went over budget on some of the items, but I don't think there's gonna be a problem. (hands over the budget file to a very annoyed George) I'll let you get back to work, George. (Mr. Wilhelm leaves the office)
"You look a little warm."
...when you're done George, and bring it directly to me. Mr Steinbrenner is very interested in this.
Look, sorry doesn't cut it. We're running a ball club here George. You've got to pay attention.
Yes Sir! (closes the door)
Wow! What an, Entrance! (friendly, to George) And eh, who might this be?
George! George, get a hold of yourself!
(puzzled) Uh, George, uh, did you call some carpet cleaners?
I'm here to clean the carpets. Most of the world is carpeted. And, one day, we will do the cleaning.
The gardener did a nice job planting the rose bushes, didn't he dear?
They're in my office, right now.
Oh, George, have you seen the American league directory? It is a big green book. Oh, thanks kiddo.
"George, there's nothing I hate more than a liar."
I wanted to get fired. George, you are looking at the new head scout of the New York Mets.
There's your answer. Downtown.
"I called this meeting because we......have........a problem. For the last few months someone has been stealing equipment from the club. Until recently it's been little things, y'know; bases, batting helmets, donuts, but two nights ago they pulled the big one. "
George, I'll tell you what I'd like you to do. I, I'd like you to drop everything.
Oh no, you've got to go downtown, George. It's all downtown. Just like the song says.
(thinks for a moment) That's right. (pause) What's for dinner?
Parents.
I still want to know what happened to that birthday card? Now, Morgan, did you ever sign it?
Mr. Steinbrenner, I am very concerned about George Costanza.
So...
That's what I came to talk to you about. Great job George. (shakes George's hand) You really nailed it.
Oh yes sir, good morning, good morning, sir.
I have this... fun little assignment I think you'll enjoy. There's some reps in from the Houston Astros for talks on that interleague play... and I want you to show them a good time.(George acts like "ok, you're the boss")
(drying his hands and heading for the door) Yes, George. I want you to make this project a top priority.
"You're a terrible liar George. Look at you, you're a wreck!. you're sweating bullets."
Morning George.
I did?
(entering the office) Yes George.
...did you go down to payroll?
"If anybody here knows anything about it I recommend strongly that...you come forward."
