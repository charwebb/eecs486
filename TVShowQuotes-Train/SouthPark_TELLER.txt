Hello Mrs. Farnicle, how are you today? Making a deposit are we? Great, we can just put that into your retirement account and make it go to work for you aaaaand it's gone.
Oh, Mr. Marsh, don't worry. We can just transfer money from your account into a portfolio with your son aaand it's gone! This line is for people who have money with the bank only please step aside. 
Then please stand aside for people who actually have money with us. Next please. 
Well that's fantastic, a really smart decision, young man. We can put that check in a Money Market Mutual Fund, then we'll reinvest the earnings into foreign currency accounts with compounding interest aaand it's gone. 
Do you have any money invested in this bank?
The money in your account - it didn't do too well, it's gone.
Welcome to Fran's. Can I help you?  Sir, can I help you?
I already told him, I can't allow anyone on the aircraft who appears to be intoxicated.
I'm sorry sir, but this line is for bank members only.
Sorry, yeah, that's gone. Please step aside for people who actually have money with the bank. Next please.
