Do you have any money invested in this bank?
Tell you what: there's plenty of points on his Mahalo Rewards card. If you wanna fly with him, I can let him go.
Hello Mrs. Farnicle, how are you today? Making a deposit are we? Great, we can just put that into your retirement account and make it go to work for you aaaaand it's gone.
Sorry, yeah, that's gone. Please step aside for people who actually have money with the bank. Next please.
The money in your account - it didn't do too well, it's gone.
Then please stand aside for people who actually have money with us. Next please. 
Well that's fantastic, a really smart decision, young man. We can put that check in a Money Market Mutual Fund, then we'll reinvest the earnings into foreign currency accounts with compounding interest aaand it's gone.
