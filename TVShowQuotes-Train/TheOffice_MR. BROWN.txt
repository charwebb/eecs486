I can't leave until you do.
Right. OK.
Great. You're the Chris Rock guy and you're guy listening.
Those are my instructions from the Corporate offices to put you through this seminar for the comments that you made. The reason I made copies for everyone was so you wouldn't be embarrassed.
Oh, great. Well, what is a hero to you?
Wait a second.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Great.
Yes, exactly. Now here's what we're going to do. I've noticed that...
Don't worry about dating.
No. With more ignorance.
Actually, I'd prefer not to start that way. Michael, I would love to have your permission to run this session. Can I have your permission?
Um, it's not throwing me. I need your signature.
So we're going to reenact this with a more positive outcome.
OK. Thank you.
Great. Guy listening. Ok, anyone else remember?
Oh, my sorry. That is not appropriate.
Ok, you're thinking of a superhero.
Thank you very much. And it would also help me if you were seated.
Now, this is a simple acronym. HERO. Uh, at Diversity Today, we believe it is very easy to be a HERO. All you need are honesty, empathy, respect and open-mindedness.
Does anyone have anything else at all? Anyone besides Michael?
Well, we only have an hour.
Oh, nice.
HERO, at Diversity Today, we believe it is very easy to be a HERO. All you need are honesty, empathy, respect and open-mindedness.
Thank you. Thank you very much. OK. Thanks for filling these out and I promise this'll be quick. At Diversity Today, our philosophy is about honesty and positive expectations. We believe that 99% of the problems in the workplace arise simply out of ignorance.
Okay, um. Uh, I'll try to make this quick.
Michael, can I talk to you candidly?
No, no, no, no. An outsider's perspective would probably be pretty helpful.
Does this company have 100 years to erase?
I'm sorry, Michael. We're actually out of time.
OK.
Yeah, but it's not appropriate. This is not helpful as a memory aid.
Great.
Um...
That's fighting ignorance with more ignorance.
Yes, please.
Yes, but you're not listening to me. Yours is the only signature I need.
Mr. Brown.
Uh, see this is what I'm talking about. We don't have to pretend we're color-blind.
Thanks for filling these out. I promise this will be quick. We only have about an hour.
Okay, Michael, I just...
Good.
Well, it's my name. It's not a test. OK? Um, so looking through the cards, I've noticed that many of you wrote down the same incident, which is ironic, because it's the exact incident I was brought in here to respond to. Now, how many of you are familiar with the Chris Rock routine? Very good. OK.
Stop it!
Oh right, more like 200 years.
Now, I need you to take these forms. This kind of expresses the joint experience we had today. And I need you to look 'em over and sign them as kind of a group pledge.
Right. Exactly. Uh, instead, we need to celebrate our diversity.
