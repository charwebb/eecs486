(The same driver as before) Pardon me sir?
Get out. Get out. Go on. Hey. Shut the door.
Your head. I can't see out the back. (Elaine slumps down in her seat) Little more.. (Elaine slumps lower) ..Little more. (Slides down until just her eyes and forehead can be seen) Thank you.
My ears are still ringing. Some woman's idea of a joke.
(Turns back, facing Kramer) Hey, man, you want some of what he got?!
No, no I said. Ehhh, forget it. (Elaine looks pleased)
Yeah. You know what I think? I think you made that whole thing up.
Yeah yeah, I know your type. You're too good to make conversation with someone like me. Oh god forbid you could discuss the Jumbles. But to go so far as to pretend you're almost deaf, I mean that is truly disgusting. And Mr. Tom Hanks, may I say he too would be disgusted by your behavior.
Pull over? Did you say pull over?! You want a piece of me?!
[taken aback] No! Impossible! It is on `Empty'!
(Yelling) I said you know what I do (Elaine is very annoyed) when I want to relax? The Jumble. Hey uh do you make a book of Jumbles?
So I guess your hearing goes in and out huh?
(The same driver as before) You with the tennis center?
I'm very sorry, you give me few minutes. I have to stop for gasoline.
Hey how about that ball man injuring Monica Seles. Wasn't that something.
Dag Gavershole Plaza huh? (Elaine ignores him) Pendant Publishing, that's books right? (Elaine is annoyed and still ignoring him) Miss?
(To Assistant) I didn't take your Chuckle, man!
Yeah, I don't read much myself, (Elaine is annoyed) well you know besides the paper. Yeah a lot of people read to relax, not me. You know what I do?
I told him I didn't take his Chuckle. I don't eat that gooey crap!
I told him I was gonna mess him up.
