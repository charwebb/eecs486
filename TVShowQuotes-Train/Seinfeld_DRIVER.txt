I told him I didn't take his Chuckle. I don't eat that gooey crap!
I'm so sorry, you'll have to forgive me. I can't hear a damn thing. I went to that rock concert last night at the garden. My seats were right up agains the speaker. It's a heavy metal group. Metalla-something.
Yeah. You know what I think? I think you made that whole thing up.
Lady, could you move your head a little bit?
Your head. I can't see out the back. (Elaine slumps down in her seat) Little more.. (Elaine slumps lower) ..Little more. (Slides down until just her eyes and forehead can be seen) Thank you.
Dag Gavershole Plaza huh? (Elaine ignores him) Pendant Publishing, that's books right? (Elaine is annoyed and still ignoring him) Miss?
Hey how about that ball man injuring Monica Seles. Wasn't that something.
Pull over? Did you say pull over?! You want a piece of me?!
(The same driver as before) You with the tennis center?
So I guess your hearing goes in and out huh?
My ears are still ringing. Some woman's idea of a joke.
(Yelling) I said you know what I do (Elaine is very annoyed) when I want to relax? The Jumble. Hey uh do you make a book of Jumbles?
(The same driver as before) Pardon me sir?
Get out. Get out. Go on. Hey. Shut the door.
No, no I said. Ehhh, forget it. (Elaine looks pleased)
(Turns back, facing Kramer) Hey, man, you want some of what he got?!
Yeah, I don't read much myself, (Elaine is annoyed) well you know besides the paper. Yeah a lot of people read to relax, not me. You know what I do?
I'm very sorry, you give me few minutes. I have to stop for gasoline.
(To Assistant) I didn't take your Chuckle, man!
I told him I was gonna mess him up.
