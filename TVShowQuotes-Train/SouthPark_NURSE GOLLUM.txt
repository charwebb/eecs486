He's been talking about "the machine" for hours. That and Daisy Fuentes.
This is the strangest thing I've ever seen!
Thank you, Mayor. I uhhh, wa-I... I don't know what to say; this has been quite a week.
Oh, I see you've noticed my disorder. I have a stillborn fetus growth attached to my head.
What I really wanna say is... well, -egh-- This may sound odd coming from a woman with a fetus sticking out of her head, but... you're all a bunch of freaks! 
I'm the school nurse. Did you hurt your nose?
Yes, Principal Victoria, the thought had occurred to me. Unfortunately, it would mean my death.
Young man, Why do you have your eyes closed? I'm not gonna hurt you.
They're just young boys. Joking is a way for them to come to terms with what they don't understand.
He's stable, but I still can't get any information out of him. I'm gonna sedate him now.
I really appreciate what you're trying to do here, but it's not necessary. I'm a pretty happy person.
Oh. Well, I'll get you an ice pack. 
Don't you realize that the last thing I ever wanted was to be singled out?  I just wanted to do my job and live my life like any normal person, but instead you've made everybody focus on my handicap all week long.  Look, I don't want to be treated different. I don't want to be treated special orh-or treated gingerly. I just want to be ridiculed, shouted at, and made fun of like all the rest of you do to each other.  And take those stupid things off your heads! 
You know, Mayor, I really should be accompanying those kids to Washington in case they get hurt. That is my job.
