Yeah. [Erin kicks box] Whoa!
I'm trying..
Well, I've been where you are now. I dated this girl Alice and it was an ugly breakup. She worked at a marketing agency right next to my house. I'd run into her every day but I had to grow up and deal with it, and I did. We're even Facebook friends now.
Oh, no, no, no. No it���s cool.
It is so unpleasant. You?
Yeah, a little bit.
I didn���t realize that everybody here dresses up every year.
Meredith, that's plenty. All right? That's more than plenty. Why does no one stop her?
Okay, Karl was actually a ballet dancer in real life. Isn't that crazy?
Andy.
Hey Erin!
For insulting a client���s recently deceased mother.
I just want to be real clear that chopsticks is not the measure of a man. [Erin and Gabe argue in background]
That Clark, huh? Errr [punches palm] Ca!
Like, 'What? What?'. And then we'll just give him a little punch in the back and--
No I���m not.
Oh, yeah, of course. I know.
Die hard reference.
I was just leaving.
Erin! Erin! Just stop.
Right, um, okay. So he says, uh, [Pete stands up] 'After we call the police, they'll waste hours trying to negotiate--'
Oh.
Alright? I'll be in the annex.
What?
No thank you. My name���s Pete.
[sarcastically] Yay, another person yelling at me.
Yeah. [long pause] You were gone.
Oh yeah.
Uh, is it Duncan?
Dude, it was an amicable break up Andy.
Oh, maybe. What do you have in mind?
Oh���okay. Sorry.
You can't fire-
I mean, are you sure...Um, yeah, I probably have a copy or two in my car.
What? Why?
Oh! All right, Alan Olson from North Dakota. He also likes Hammermill and Georgia Pacific.
Ok, Pam. Why don't you visit your buddy, the crew guy that got fired? Find out what they got.
Yeah. We uh, have a history.
What?
Smoking.
Uh, yeah. We promised each other if we ever got lice, we'd buddy up. Sorry, man.
Yeah, no problem. How was it?
Fonas chek!
It���s cool, man. I���m sure you and I will have our own thing.
Wow. Cause, uh [gestures to him and Erin and then to Pam and Jim with sound effects]
Yeah, me too. It's weird. Hard to remember what's real at this point.
Fine.
See ya later, Heymont.
It was Pam's idea. Pam was the mastermind.
Ok.
You don't like flying, do you?'
No, it actually  feels kinda nice.
Yeah. Look, uh I understand breakups are tough. You know, it happens to all of us at some point in life. But you've gotta move on.
It is awkward. This is a really uncomfortable situation that you've contrived.
[whispering] OK.
Yeah.
Your morning 3-by-5. Coming right up.
You know what? Never too married for a noogie.
Common mistake.
Andy.
Yeah.
Awesome. Have fun.
The weird thing is Erin is doing the audition alone.
What���s the opposite of a horse?
This is nicer, it's fun. It's fun!
That was killer. I was so close to blowing it.
Yeah we noticed early on, Andy really appreciates enthusiasm.
Oh sorry! Sorry.
Did she buy it?
Okay, call down. It���s just me, not Tom Selleck.
Okay.
No, Clark's not my friend. He is the douche that sits next to me at the office. My friends are Scott, Glenn, and Rob. But, you don't know them.
Pete!
Hey, hey, hey, it���s just a mistake. Just a mistake. That���s what this tower���s all about -- ��mistakes. Okay, if you���re afraid of screwing up, the tower���s not for you. Show of hands --- who here has never had a complaint? That���s right. Nobody. See that? Nobody. Okay? Let���s get back to work, huh? Come on, you in?
Andy, that is really inappropriate.
Well, a woman who struggled with obesity all her life.
That is transcribed by some fan. They make mistakes.
Yes.
Relax.
Really? I got something?
All right, all right.Okay, start over.
I'll get my coat.
Seems unnecessary for an audition.
Andy?
Toby!
Can you hand me a card?
Oh, you don't have to apologize. I just... I just want you to be happy. OK? [Erin smiles and kisses Pete]
For a long time, Andy.
Well, okay, then.
Sorry, man. Andy though Erin needed a co-anchor. I'm his makeup guy. My hands are tied.
Okay.
Yeah, I'm kinda sad to see this baby go.
It just occurred to me that Andy has been calling me Plop for so long, he forgot my real name. Which is Pete.
Okay.
I do think we can have a fair....
[referring to the letter] It���s open.
Now, I'd say Clark could be your co-host... he's already doing camera.
That���s the idea.
Yeah but, she doesn't think she's gonna be like, career musician right?
All right.
Alright, so I'll be like, 'You're so sweet guys and so kind'.
[sound effect of throwing ball]
[doing a series of hand bumps with Erin] Bap, bup, bup, bap. Wait. Did I go first and then you?
Oh my god.
Come out to the coast, we'll get together, have a few laughs.'
All right. Check it out.
Just saying. How many famous trumpeters can you name besides... Louis Armstrong?
Uh, I like all kinds of music, Gabe.
No.
That���s really nice.
There you go.
This next card comes to us thanks to Meredith Palmer, who called Eastern Pennsylvania Seminary a, quote ���sausage factory.���
Well. Is it?
What?
It was college. That is what you do.
Erin, did this call...
Like a Phoenix from the ashes. Ksshhhh!
Why haven't you seen die hard?
Yeah, he is.
Then we created a bunch of fake friends for Derek, and we had all of them ���Like��� Derek���s ���Likes.���
Ok [tries to help her] Hey hey hey, whoa.
Hey.
Hey, just having fun Jimmy.
A little mo' cardio.
What?
Hey, um, I knew something bothered me and I finally figured it out. What news producers are gonna want to see is how Erin relates to the other people on the news team.
yeah. That���s-- that is terrible.
Poor Angela.
Yeah, not a lot of money in the arts, right?
One of my jobs is to input customer complaints into the computer. And when they���re in, I fill out one of these cards. But the information���s already on the computer, so....why am I filling out the card? I asked Andy, and he told me to ���chillax,��� and then went away on a big, long boat ride. So here we are. Don���t give me a pointless office chore, because I will build a little paper house. ��Fight the power.
Will do.
Uh, no one recognizes me. But not all my friends call me Plop. So��� thanks PBS.
No, that's the--
Yeah, whatever you say, boss.
You mean horses?
What?
Douche.
Yeah. Definitely. [Erin starts to cry] Hey, what's--Oh, no, come here. [Starts to put his arm around Erin] Hey, hey. Come on, huh?
If you want to talk to me
Well, I���ve gotta build a wider base first before I can go higher.
[to Erin] Stocking pens, huh? You���re like the new office administrator.
Hey, did Erin already take off?
That, is awesome!
I'll be in the annex.
I've got the seat adjusted right.
Well, I���m still just fitting in here, you know? Getting used to the new job. But, definitely on the agenda. But that is a good idea, Angela. I should make a list.
Hey, you OK?
I don���t want it, really.
There we go. All right, let���s do it.
Erin says she's gonna break up with Andy, but I'm not sure. He's coming back tomorrow and surprise, today, she wants to do whatever I'd like. You know, when I was a kid, we had a dog who go real sick and we had to 'send him to a farm'. And on his last day, we did everything he loved.
The point is Pam, is there are jobs-
My brother dared me to memorize it, and I did it, and loved doing it.
She's nice to me.
I want to start my own business. I want to be a millionaire. Lots of things. Travel, make the world a better place, earn an MBA at night.
And there are hobbies. I love baseball more than anything, but you don't see me try to get on the Mets.
[whispering] Yeah, I know, I heard. I heard.
Our crowning complaint card comes to us thanks to Pamela Halpert...
That is correct. Come on, guys, where is this even coming from?
Nice to see you again, Pam.
There we go.
Andy, just so you know, there was no overlap.
Let Heinrich plant the detonators and Theo prepare the vault. After that--'
Oh. Nope. It's not that, he uh, uh he flipped a table one time when he was drunk.
Toby?
Hear what?
Yeah.
Nicely done. Very nicely done. All right, this next one goes to Darryl for pocket dialing a customer while having sex.
I don't think that's Nelly.
Hey, some buddies of mine are going to Poor Richard's for beers and pool, you wanna come? I can't promise you too much, but uh, you might get to meet my friend flipper.
Why don't you say in the beginning: ���This isn't really going that well���
Hey, look who it is!
All right. Up next we got a whole lotta Creed.
Alice. Oh man.
Cool. He's like 40 though, right?
Toby got us all to participate in Movember. It���s a charity for prostate cancer. You pledge money and then you grow a mustache for the month of November.
Oh, that's okay, bud.
NASCAR. The Amazing Race.
Sure, boxing, tennis.
[putting mayo on Erin's head] How's that?
Uh-huh.
I'm just hoping German terrorists don't take over this Christmas party. Make me go all John McClane on their asses.
Actually, he doesn't say that there. He says it earlier when he's on the radio with Hans.
Someone who's already got rapport with Erin, maybe. I don't know. [Andy smiles at camera]
A horse.
Yeah, come on, Tobes.
Kevin, I can hear you.
Wow.
See, so you just push from under, and turn it around, and boom. No the staple crimps outward.
Hey.
Or we can just sit and talk, though.
Yeah.
