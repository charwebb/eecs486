May I help you.

Captain Hindsight! Sir! Calls for help are pouring in! You've got to get out to the Gulf!

Look, I first knew something was wrong when I looked at Bono's first award for biggest crap. It said he took it in 1960.

Here he is. 

Magic. Magic, could you come to the front for a minute? There are a couple of boys here to see you. Two brave little buddies who against all odds have journeyed across America to find the cure for AIDS. All they have are each other in a race against time. 

About what?

Yes.

That doesn't matter now, sir! People are getting hurt in the Gulf and they need to know what they could've done!

Can I help you?

Sir! SIR!

I'm sorry, but Mr. Martin does not see fans.

But when did you have a-

He doesn't do private readings.

Can I help you?

Alright, come on in. 

My God, is that you and... Courtney Love?

Mr. Teabag! Get out! 

What, sir? You know you can tell me.

Just wait here. I'll go fetch him. 

Can I help you?

Yes sir.

Found what?

Hey, Joseph! I told my wife that you spoke with God and Jesus, and she didn't believe it.

Who is this, please?

Excuse me, sir. These boys wanted to speak with you.

Because nobody has ever taken a crap that big before!

What is it in regard to? 

Your father is in grave danger. Come with me! 

Mr. Rivera.

The captain is very busy dealing with the Gulf oil crisis.

Mr. Hindsight, sir.  This young man would like a word.

Yes?

So that's the year Bono was born. Then it all made sense to me. How could Bono be so talented, so caring, and yet seem like such a piece of crap? Because he is crap. Don't you get it? Bono is not the record holder...
