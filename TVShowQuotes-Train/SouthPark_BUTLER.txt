Your father is in grave danger. Come with me! 
Mr. Bono, you have a young gentleman caller! 
Because nobody has ever taken a crap that big before!
My God, is that you and... Courtney Love?
So that's the year Bono was born. Then it all made sense to me. How could Bono be so talented, so caring, and yet seem like such a piece of crap? Because he is crap. Don't you get it? Bono is not the record holder...
Mr. Hindsight, sir.  This young man would like a word.
The captain is very busy dealing with the Gulf oil crisis.
Look, I first knew something was wrong when I looked at Bono's first award for biggest crap. It said he took it in 1960.
That doesn't matter now, sir! People are getting hurt in the Gulf and they need to know what they could've done!
Excuse me, sir. These boys wanted to speak with you.
Magic. Magic, could you come to the front for a minute? There are a couple of boys here to see you. Two brave little buddies who against all odds have journeyed across America to find the cure for AIDS. All they have are each other in a race against time. 
I'm sorry, but Mr. Martin does not see fans.
Captain Hindsight! Sir! Calls for help are pouring in! You've got to get out to the Gulf!
Hey, Joseph! I told my wife that you spoke with God and Jesus, and she didn't believe it.
