You in here, Peter?

Whazzat?

They did it!

I certainly don't understand kids' music today. Sounds like diarrhea to me.

Saturday is perfect for me.

All-natural cell phones! 

What's the matter?

Yeah!

Is it contagious?

If I was gonna fuck my son, I'd kiss him first! 

Have you ever heard of another species, memeing on the Internet?

Boring.

Space, sн. Fly.

This is the first guy to actually make sense. 

Do you know where this shit goes? 

Oh, yeah!

…Oh. 

Yeah, I had the minnestrone over here. 

We all have BFFs, and we believe that a BFF is the highest legal authority.

This is a really nice town you have here. That's why the corporations are trying to use you to take it down.

No doubt about it...

Yeah.

Wait! Look! 

Are you okay?

Biggest party in the world, baby! 

Mmm, Chipotle. 

What the hell are you doing?! 

Well what are we gonna do now?

Huh?

Me-ee!

Sí.

Give me a break!

Ohh wow, it's the Avengers!

Do it again!

Skip a free lunch? Not me! 

See you later.

You'll never stop him, you know. 

Oh, yeah. We can't do Sunday.

You homeless or homeowners?

Come on, they gotta be around here somewhere!

Yeah, they took our jobs!

We're having a hard time following you here.

Yep.

I'd like to know about the biology of the trees.

No, don't. You're wasting your time.

I think it's so great that someone took the initiative to have a meeting like this.

We can do it! 

It's a UFO! 

Hey kid, how come you ignored my friend request?

Jennifer, We love you Jennifer!

I'm betting on the Devil!

Professor Lamont, we need to talk.

Huh?

Nissse

You bastard!

We've got to find those kids!

No no, can't you imagine a place where people live together and like, provide services for each other in exchange for their services?

It's out of control! 

Yeah! George Bush doesn't care about beavers!

Yeah! Let's sue the lawyer!

Yeah.

Egah I don't know, maybe the rule should be somebody can buy the medicinal weed for others.

Oh yeah. Right in the balls, man. Right square in the balls.

Oh, march? What are we marching for?

Ogh!

The Great One.  Cthulhu. He has risen, and soon all will be under his rule. It has all been foretold in the Necronomicon.  Hail Cthulhu! The darkness of the mythos is finally here.  Oh man, these are really good lemon bars. 

Look out for the pee! 

Hey! What's that guy doing?!

O-ah... Two hundred.

Woohoo!

Could you get another picture of us? 

Ohh! Noo! 

Well, that's about it. Let's go.

You're an expert on memes, Professor Lamont.

Mm hmm.

That's right.

It is a disease because it's a physical dependency. That makes it a disease.

And what about little Laura, the Williams' kid? If she doesn't get that heart-valve operation, she could die.  Yeah! Yeah, that's right!

Oh, where can I hide this big pipe?

Yes.

Hey, it is him.

Rrrgh it's like, I can't explain it. I just suddenly feel like this isn't right. 

Oh yeah, huh. Jalapeño poppers.

Well, that was easy. 

Need help across the street, Ms. Claridge?  Well all right then. 

We're in the moving business! Fourteen years we've been workin' our butts off! Now these future folk come in and we can't get work nowhere! They took our jobs!

You have to admit you're an alcoholic.

Two hundred... dollars.

To me it looked like Mysterion to me. Everyone who's seen Mysterion, say yeah!

How long was it?

And apparently the organizer is just an eight year old boy who was touched by the film.

I have a question: Can we review the best ways to hold a rope again? 

Sorry we made you wait, everybody. 

Care for a peanut butter and jelly sandwich?!

Oh my God!

Ogh, that is so courageous.

This is killing my buzz.

You are saying cats are showing signs of evolution with their cat breading meme?

My God. We're famous! 

Oo-yee-hee-yeh-hah!

Don't bro down against Sondheim, Randy! It's suicide!

Cover! Cover! 

I'll take ten lemon bars.

Sounds like a dream, bro.

All right, I'm next! I'm next! Get this thing off of me! 

Well then how'd you know her birthday was in November?

There he is! 

Yeah, well I'm just a guy that gets ignored, I guess! 

Very cultural, yes.

Well the Simpsons is such a great show, and we need reminders like this to keep us watching.

Hey, what happened to the tunes, man?
