This is a really nice town you have here. That's why the corporations are trying to use you to take it down.

Cover! Cover! 

Hey, it is him.

Sí, fly.

Oh, yeah!

Don't bro down against Sondheim, Randy! It's suicide!

You're an expert on memes, Professor Lamont.

They did it!

Do me next. I wanna talk to my mother.

Well then how'd you know her birthday was in November?

Oho, and Honey Boo Boo!  Kids, come see the green Honey Boo Boo costume!

Huh?

Hey kid, how come you ignored my friend request?

You have to admit you're an alcoholic.

All right, I'm next! I'm next! Get this thing off of me! 

We're having a hard time following you here.

Need help across the street, Ms. Claridge?  Well all right then. 

Right now we're proving we don't need corporations. We don't need money. This can become a commune where everyone just helps each other.

Oo-yee-hee-yeh-hah!

Give me a break!

And what about little Laura, the Williams' kid? If she doesn't get that heart-valve operation, she could die.  Yeah! Yeah, that's right!

Ohh wow, it's the Avengers!

Yeah, well I'm just a guy that gets ignored, I guess! 

Care for a peanut butter and jelly sandwich?!

…Oh. 

I'd like to know about the biology of the trees.

This is killing my buzz.

My God. We're famous! 

Yeah, I had the minnestrone over here. 

Ogh!

It's out of control! 

Oh yeah. Right in the balls, man. Right square in the balls.

Oh yeah, huh. Jalapeño poppers.

Oh my God!

Are you okay?

No, don't. You're wasting your time.

What the hell are you doing?! 

Skip a free lunch? Not me! 

We can do it! 

Yeah, they took our jobs!

Saturday is perfect for me.

You in here, Peter?

Yeah.

Woohoo!

Ogh, that is so courageous.

That's right.

This is the first guy to actually make sense. 

And apparently the organizer is just an eight year old boy who was touched by the film.

Egah I don't know, maybe the rule should be somebody can buy the medicinal weed for others.

There he is! 

Yeah! I mean, there were children watching that auction! And when that little eight-year-old boy walked up and flashed his... penis! It was an outrage! 

I'll take ten lemon bars.

Well, that's about it. Let's go.

Sorry we made you wait, everybody. 

Canada, on strike.

Professor Lamont, we need to talk.

All-natural cell phones! 

Rrrgh it's like, I can't explain it. I just suddenly feel like this isn't right. 

Because we just came from there! There was nothing! Not one scrap of Internet!

Yeah! George Bush doesn't care about beavers!

What's the matter?

Biggest party in the world, baby! 

It is a disease because it's a physical dependency. That makes it a disease.

Yeah!

You are saying cats are showing signs of evolution with their cat breading meme?

Two hundred... dollars.

You'll never stop him, you know. 

Huh?

Boring.

Oh, where can I hide this big pipe?

If I was gonna fuck my son, I'd kiss him first! 

We're in the moving business! Fourteen years we've been workin' our butts off! Now these future folk come in and we can't get work nowhere! They took our jobs!

Come on, they gotta be around here somewhere!

Mmm, Chipotle. 

Oh my God.

Well the Simpsons is such a great show, and we need reminders like this to keep us watching.

Look out for the pee! 

Me-ee!

Sí.

Oh, yeah. We can't do Sunday.

Ohh! Noo! 

Whazzat?

Yeah.

Do it again!

We all have BFFs, and we believe that a BFF is the highest legal authority.

To me it looked like Mysterion to me. Everyone who's seen Mysterion, say yeah!

Mm hmm.

The Great One.  Cthulhu. He has risen, and soon all will be under his rule. It has all been foretold in the Necronomicon.  Hail Cthulhu! The darkness of the mythos is finally here.  Oh man, these are really good lemon bars. 

Space, sн. Fly.

Well uh, we were thinkin' we would, you know, just go appeal to the Governor.

Hey, what happened to the tunes, man?

Heard about it? They said you could have easily cleared fifty homeless with that jump.

I have a question: Can we review the best ways to hold a rope again? 

Well, that was easy. 

It's a UFO! 

No no, can't you imagine a place where people live together and like, provide services for each other in exchange for their services?

Yes.

No doubt about it...

Yep.

O-ah... Two hundred.

Have you ever heard of another species, memeing on the Internet?

Do you know where this shit goes? 

Oh, march? What are we marching for?

Jennifer, We love you Jennifer!

Wait! Look! 

Is it contagious?

Hey, whoa now. John Edward is for real.

You homeless or homeowners?

Very cultural, yes.

You bastard!

Could you get another picture of us?
