All right, Lubeck. How much is she worth?
One moment. I'm reading the most fascinating article on the most fascinating people of the year. Annnnnd, done. Oh, yes. I'm sorry I needed this so quickly (leafing through the pages). It must have been an awful lot of work. Thank you very much, you two.
Elaine, up until a moment ago, I was convinced that I was on the receiving end of one of the oldest baker's grift in the books--The Entenmann's shim-sham.
So, I have two tickets for you (holds up the bits of card) to the Flying Sandos Brothers magic show.
What does that have to do with my clubs?
Kramer, my friend, (Gestures to Elaine) consider Elaine at your disposal.
Jaba! Bagama ma Jaba. Olymala Hungui. (The boy runs out of the room)
Now, down to business. (thoughtful) I have had this vision of a diaphanous rum-runner scarf.
Elaine! Where's Susie? I want her to head up our new Fingerless Glove Division.
You're an errand girl, sent by grocery clerks, to collect a bill.
Well, that's pretty exciting. (Pause) Let's put that in the book.
(emotional) And I thought I knew what love was.
Until I remembered the videotape surveillance system that I installed to catch other-Walter using my latrine. But it also caught this.
So did you have any trouble finding the place?
But, unfortunately I will be out of town with my lady-friend and therefore unable to bid on the lot. I was hoping maybe you would go in my stead.
(to Bob) I want you to handle all the fact-checking and the copy-editing for the new catalogue.
Oh, Elaine. George, when momma said 'Bosco' she must have been trying to communicate something, a legacy, a dying wish perhaps.
And, in a tiny way, I almost feel responsible. I'm the one who sent him to Thailand - in search of low-cost whistles. Filled his head with pseudoerotic tales of my own Opium excursions. Plus, I have him some phone numbers of places he could score near the hotel.
Then in the distance I heard the bulls. I began running as fast as I could. Fortunately I was wearing my Italian Captoe Oxfords. Sophisticated yet different; nothing to make a huge fuss about. Rich dark brown calfskin leather. Matching leather vent. Men's whole and half sizes 7 through 13. Price $135.00.
(interrupting) There's no need to deny it, Elaine. I heard every word you said.
Not a chance. I'm afraid I'll just have to find someone else to accompany me on my journey. The dark continent is no place for an addict, Elaine.
...and I, of course, will return to mine. Kudos, Elaine, on a job... done.
I just spoke with her, Elaine. She's in bed.
Get well, get well soon we wish you to get well.
She's stuffed up, achy, and suffering from intense malaise.
(upbeat) Oh, Elaine, this dry air is curing me like a Black Forest ham.
Oh, Elaine, we've covered all of that in the catalogue ad nauseum. No, I would like this book to be about my day-to-day life.
You know George, growing up as a boy in Costa Rica, I heard a rumor that momma had taken a lover. Perhaps Bosco was this man's name.
I would see no trouble in spending up to, say, ten thousand dollars. Have my secretary give you a signed cheque.
We're gonna sell this as a top. Here's the angle Zelda Fitzgerald, aaaand, somebody in the 20s, wearing this at wild parties, driving all the men crazy (tosses the bra on Elaines desk) Have it on my desk by the end of the week.
Elaine. I think I've been working you a little too hard, lately.
Unfortunately, I am also disgusted. This is incoherent drivel! This is a total redo. And I'm assuming I need it right away.
(Intrigued) The very pants I was returning. That's perfect irony! Elaine, that is interesting writing! (The intercom beeps)
Eh, never mind. (turns to Elaine) Elaine, you do it.
Another productive meeting. By the way, I saw that English Patient film last night. It was extraordinary.
Well, it started out nicely "I'm returning some pants." A very identifiable problem.. (turns page) "I set of down a train tunnel.".. (turns page) But that's where the story takes a most unappealing turn.
Elaine? Guess what. I've decided to Form a Charitable Foundation, in Susie's honor. And as Susie's best friend, I want you to be involved.
Ah, the tickets are for tonight. So you and Bob can knock off a little early, so you both can get ready.
You want to know something? I no longer need them!
Ha ha ha ha...Oh, what a stirring little anthem of wellness.
George, you're obviously lying, anyone can see that!
She is The Best. What was your name again.
Elaine! Excellent. I'd like you to meet a friend of mine, Irwin Lubeck.
I understand, no hard feelings. George and I will miss your company. Fong? It will just be two this evening. George, we dine.
Well, now that we have that cleared up.. why don't the three of us have lunch.
Momma. Just talk to her, George. The doctor seems to think it helps.
(excited) Elaine! You found the clubs. That's wonderful news. Where are they?
Elaine, do you have a moment? It's about your lover.
So, anyway, effective immediately, Miss Benes will return to her old position, at her original salary...
Damn it, Elaine. That wasn't Zach. That was the yam-yam. Now, he is going cold turkey. (Ordering) And you will be at his side.
Inside that small college boy minifridge is my latest acquisition. A slice of cake from the wedding of King Edward VIII to Wallis Simpson, circa 1937, price--$29,000.
(slower and louder) Why don't you handle all the copy-editing?
(returns) Flash of lightning Elaine I just realized why I like this cartoon so much.
We missed you at the get well party. Poor old Walt has a polyp in the duodenum. It's benign, but--ooh--still a bastard. Oh, Elaine, can you keep a secret?
Apparently Peggy--down in Design?--got into a liiiittle bit of a Tiff yesterday with somebody named, "Susie"?
Well, I see what's going on in here. I am smack dab in the middle of a good old fashioned cat fight.
(steps up to the podium, refreshed) Ahhh. I don't think I'll ever be able to forget Susie--ahhh. And most of all, I will never, forget that one night. Working late on the catalogue. Juuust the two of us. And we surrendered to temptation. And it was Pretty Good.
I don't believe that for a minute. Well, Elaine, it was good of you to stop by.
Just Hold On a minute. Still One Short.
Sotheby's is having an auction of JFK's memorabilia. One item in particular has caught my eye. The presidential golf clubs. To me, they capture that indefinable romance that was Camelot.
Elaine. I never knew Kennedy had such a temper.
It's morning. Thanks for seeing me through the night. I'll make us a pot of coffee, George. Watch her, won't you?
And I know you wouldn't be just having fun with his handicap. (staring away) That kind of cruelty would be grounds for dismissal.
Well, I have a feeling that what you are about to go through is punishment enough. Dismissed.
Oh, I'll be inaugrating them this weekend, with none other than Ethel Kennedy. A woman whose triumph in the face of tragedy is exceeded only by her proclivity to procreate.
So, we pay off your friend, and it becomes a Peterman.
Elaine, what did you want to talk me about?
Nevertheless, Elaine. The House, of Peterman is in Disorder. First thing tomorrow morning I want to see you, Peggy, and, Susie right here, in my office.
And so, I made an explosive out of chick peas, and I stopped that great rhino right in his tracks.
(Looking at his dying plant) Ohh, damn. I forgot to buy plant food again.. I'll bet I got a coupon for it. (Starts looking through a small coupon box)
That irreverence, that wit I'd recognize it anywhere. Some charlatan has stolen a Ziggy and passed it off as his own. I can prove it. Quick Elaine, to my archives.
That's the best way to get someplace you've never been.
So as a result of your test being free of opium, I am reinstating you.
I saw a woman in our hallway wearing one of these as a top. (sits on the corner of the desk)What exquisite beauty, I ran down the hallway to talk to her, but the elevator door closed. It was not to be.Perhaps our paths will cross again some day.
It's jammed! I'll slide it under the door,
(Hangs up) There you are, Elaine. Go forth, and create. (Elaine gets up to leave) And, by the way, when you get to that chapter about my romantic escapades - feel free to toss yourself in the mix.
That reminds me of the Hatian Voodoo rattle torture! You haven't gone over to their side have you?
All right, brace yourself, Lubeck. You are about to be launched via pastry back to the wedding of one of the most dashing and romantic Nazi sympathizers of the entire British Royal family.
Elaine, do you see this? Do you see what I'm holding in my hands?
Elaine, I hope you're watching the clothes, because I can't take my eyes off the passion.
You know what a huge fan I am of John F Kennedy.
...And there, tucked into the river's bend was the object of my search. The Gwon-Jaya River market, fabrics and spices traded under a starlit sky. It was there that I discovered the Pamplona beret. Sizes seven-and-a-half through eight-and-three-quarters. Price? Thirty-five dollars.
Mama, it's me. Jacopo. I'm here for you, mama.
Elaine, who among us hasn't snuck into the break room to nibble on a love newton?
well, I'm sure we'll come up with something. What do you say you and I order ourselves a pie? Do you like Lorenzo's?
Ah, yes. Well this certainly looks like a lot of words. In record time. I'm very impressed ... with both of you.
That infernal rattling sound that has plagued me these past two days - and I could not find the source. In my office, in the hallway. Even in the men's room! Shame on you, Elaine!
I'm afraid the problem with Zach is more serious. He's back on the horse, Elaine. Smack. White palace. The Chinaman's nightcap.
I'd be happy to Elaine (he starts reading the form as she hands him a pen)... but I will have to see this hat.
I wanna market this item as a new direction in women's fashion.
Ah, Fong has been most accommodating. Shall we?
Oh! no right away, chop, chop........Oh! a new cartoon....."I wish I was taller (hearty laugh) I'd like to see that complaint get rectified. (more laughs and he leaves)
Look, there's a man in there. Get out of there, you're in danger!
I'm afraid it's your urine, Elaine. You tested positive for opium.
That's it! Drop everything. We're going right now.
3.. I don't know what that is.. where's my damn preview channel?
(Laughs) Kramer, my friend, that is one ripping good yarn.. (Hands Kramer a check)
It just seems so cliched, and obvious. It's not interesting writing.
That's right, Elaine. White lotus. Yam-yam. Shanghai Sally.
(looks at his watch) It's only five fifteen. So, later on that same day, I developed a great hankering for some wild honey...
I'm afraid I have some bad news, Elaine. It appears you will not be accompanying me to Africa.
My friends, a toast. As the wolly-haired Melanasians of Papua, New Guinea once said, (Makes a series of clicking and popping sounds. The music starts up) All right! Who's dancing? (No one makes a gesture that they intend to dance) No one? Alright, I'll just have to get things started. (Grabs a female employee, and starts dancing with her. The crowd is impressed)
Yes, that's the one! Good day Elaine. (Leaves.)
Very soft, huge button flaps, cargo pockets, draw string waist, deep biswing vents in the back perfect for jumping into a gondola.
Well, Elaine, has nothing but Good things to say about Susie.
Ohhh.. It's just a place to flop. (Sits in his recliner)
Twenty thousand dollars!?! Elaine, that's twice the amount I authorised you to spend.
But Iiii never heard her Cries for Help. (sighs) An' nowww.. Susie is gone.
Nonsense! (To Kramer) I have Benes' woderfully imaginative mind to spin my stories. You take back your tales, you vagabond!
Elaine, you're out of control. You need help.
It was the Peace Corps that gave me my start in this business. (nostalgic) Clothing the naked natives of Bantu Besh.
Oh no, that doesnt matter now. That's a very nice jacket.
Ha ha, nonsense, George. Besides it gives me a chance to tell you about my latest trip to Burma where I discovered a very unusual corduroy.
Yes. Between you, me and the lamppost. And the desk. Peggy says this "Suze" isn't much of a Worker.
Oh, no Elaine, stay. Lubeck here is the world's foremost appraiser of vintage pastry.
Elaine, according to your urine analysis, you're menopausal. you have the metabolism of a sixty-eight year old woman.
(Cutting her off) No buts, Elaine. Or I will strip you of your 'associate' status. (Goes to leave) Uh, P.S., the first twenty-four hours are the worst. Better bring a poncho.
(smiles and laughs) Ha ha ha. Funny you should ask, Elaine.
Fortunately, I still have George here to help me through this.
Bob, we have a little baptism by fire for you, so to speak.
George, there's no time! Tell him your code! Shout out your code, man!!
Oh, Elaine. The toll road of denial is a long and dangerous one. The price? Your soul. Oh, and by the way, you have til' 500 to clear out your desk. You're fired.
The fire will eat up this entire block!
I know what you're going through. I too once fell under the spell of opium. It was 1979. I was travelling the Yangtzee in search of a Mongolian horsehair vest. I had got to the market after sundown, all of the clothing traders had gone, but a different sort of trader still lurked about. "Just a taste," he said. That was all it took.
(leans forward, whispers carefully) I feel the same way. (announcing) And that's why this foundation will meet around Your Schedule. Nights! Weekends! Every, Free Moment you have. (leaving, pats her shoulders confidently)
Elaine, I have a question for you. Is the item still...with you?
