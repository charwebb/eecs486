So did you have any trouble finding the place?
Elaine, up until a moment ago, I was convinced that I was on the receiving end of one of the oldest baker's grift in the books--The Entenmann's shim-sham.
I know what you're going through. I too once fell under the spell of opium. It was 1979. I was travelling the Yangtzee in search of a Mongolian horsehair vest. I had got to the market after sundown, all of the clothing traders had gone, but a different sort of trader still lurked about. "Just a taste," he said. That was all it took.
Elaine, who among us hasn't snuck into the break room to nibble on a love newton?
Look, there's a man in there. Get out of there, you're in danger!
(returns) Flash of lightning Elaine I just realized why I like this cartoon so much.
(Laughs) Kramer, my friend, that is one ripping good yarn.. (Hands Kramer a check)
We're gonna sell this as a top. Here's the angle Zelda Fitzgerald, aaaand, somebody in the 20s, wearing this at wild parties, driving all the men crazy (tosses the bra on Elaines desk) Have it on my desk by the end of the week.
What does that have to do with my clubs?
Twenty thousand dollars!?! Elaine, that's twice the amount I authorised you to spend.
(to Bob) I want you to handle all the fact-checking and the copy-editing for the new catalogue.
Ha ha, nonsense, George. Besides it gives me a chance to tell you about my latest trip to Burma where I discovered a very unusual corduroy.
(upbeat) Oh, Elaine, this dry air is curing me like a Black Forest ham.
Ah, yes. Well this certainly looks like a lot of words. In record time. I'm very impressed ... with both of you.
I just spoke with her, Elaine. She's in bed.
All right, Lubeck. How much is she worth?
She is The Best. What was your name again.
Oh, I'll be inaugrating them this weekend, with none other than Ethel Kennedy. A woman whose triumph in the face of tragedy is exceeded only by her proclivity to procreate.
Eh, never mind. (turns to Elaine) Elaine, you do it.
All right, brace yourself, Lubeck. You are about to be launched via pastry back to the wedding of one of the most dashing and romantic Nazi sympathizers of the entire British Royal family.
Well, now that we have that cleared up.. why don't the three of us have lunch.
Unfortunately, I am also disgusted. This is incoherent drivel! This is a total redo. And I'm assuming I need it right away.
Ohhh.. It's just a place to flop. (Sits in his recliner)
It just seems so cliched, and obvious. It's not interesting writing.
That's it! Drop everything. We're going right now.
(leans forward, whispers carefully) I feel the same way. (announcing) And that's why this foundation will meet around Your Schedule. Nights! Weekends! Every, Free Moment you have. (leaving, pats her shoulders confidently)
Nevertheless, Elaine. The House, of Peterman is in Disorder. First thing tomorrow morning I want to see you, Peggy, and, Susie right here, in my office.
3.. I don't know what that is.. where's my damn preview channel?
But Iiii never heard her Cries for Help. (sighs) An' nowww.. Susie is gone.
Yes. Between you, me and the lamppost. And the desk. Peggy says this "Suze" isn't much of a Worker.
I'm afraid I have some bad news, Elaine. It appears you will not be accompanying me to Africa.
Now, down to business. (thoughtful) I have had this vision of a diaphanous rum-runner scarf.
One moment. I'm reading the most fascinating article on the most fascinating people of the year. Annnnnd, done. Oh, yes. I'm sorry I needed this so quickly (leafing through the pages). It must have been an awful lot of work. Thank you very much, you two.
Well, I have a feeling that what you are about to go through is punishment enough. Dismissed.
well, I'm sure we'll come up with something. What do you say you and I order ourselves a pie? Do you like Lorenzo's?
Elaine, what did you want to talk me about?
It's jammed! I'll slide it under the door,
Oh, Elaine, we've covered all of that in the catalogue ad nauseum. No, I would like this book to be about my day-to-day life.
Jaba! Bagama ma Jaba. Olymala Hungui. (The boy runs out of the room)
Well, Elaine, has nothing but Good things to say about Susie.
You want to know something? I no longer need them!
(interrupting) There's no need to deny it, Elaine. I heard every word you said.
Until I remembered the videotape surveillance system that I installed to catch other-Walter using my latrine. But it also caught this.
So, we pay off your friend, and it becomes a Peterman.
You know what a huge fan I am of John F Kennedy.
I'm afraid it's your urine, Elaine. You tested positive for opium.
I saw a woman in our hallway wearing one of these as a top. (sits on the corner of the desk)What exquisite beauty, I ran down the hallway to talk to her, but the elevator door closed. It was not to be.Perhaps our paths will cross again some day.
(smiles and laughs) Ha ha ha. Funny you should ask, Elaine.
(quietly) Well, why didn't you say so in the first place? You're fired.
Kramer, my friend, (Gestures to Elaine) consider Elaine at your disposal.
Inside that small college boy minifridge is my latest acquisition. A slice of cake from the wedding of King Edward VIII to Wallis Simpson, circa 1937, price--$29,000.
But, unfortunately I will be out of town with my lady-friend and therefore unable to bid on the lot. I was hoping maybe you would go in my stead.
Ha ha ha ha ha!$219,000! Lubeck, you glorious titwillow. You just made me a profit of $190,000.
Then in the distance I heard the bulls. I began running as fast as I could. Fortunately I was wearing my Italian Captoe Oxfords. Sophisticated yet different; nothing to make a huge fuss about. Rich dark brown calfskin leather. Matching leather vent. Men's whole and half sizes 7 through 13. Price $135.00.
I wanna market this item as a new direction in women's fashion.
Elaine, I'm afraid I have incurred yet another flat tire.
That infernal rattling sound that has plagued me these past two days - and I could not find the source. In my office, in the hallway. Even in the men's room! Shame on you, Elaine!
Elaine! Where's Susie? I want her to head up our new Fingerless Glove Division.
And, in a tiny way, I almost feel responsible. I'm the one who sent him to Thailand - in search of low-cost whistles. Filled his head with pseudoerotic tales of my own Opium excursions. Plus, I have him some phone numbers of places he could score near the hotel.
Elaine? Guess what. I've decided to Form a Charitable Foundation, in Susie's honor. And as Susie's best friend, I want you to be involved.
Well, it started out nicely "I'm returning some pants." A very identifiable problem.. (turns page) "I set of down a train tunnel.".. (turns page) But that's where the story takes a most unappealing turn.
I understand, no hard feelings. George and I will miss your company. Fong? It will just be two this evening. George, we dine.
(Looking at his dying plant) Ohh, damn. I forgot to buy plant food again.. I'll bet I got a coupon for it. (Starts looking through a small coupon box)
(excited) Elaine! You found the clubs. That's wonderful news. Where are they?
That's right, Elaine. White lotus. Yam-yam. Shanghai Sally.
(Turns on the T.V, and starts flipping through the channels) Oh damn. They changed the cable stations again.. just when I finally memorized them.
Elaine, do you have a moment? It's about your lover.
The fire will eat up this entire block!
She's stuffed up, achy, and suffering from intense malaise.
George, you're obviously lying, anyone can see that!
So, anyway, effective immediately, Miss Benes will return to her old position, at her original salary...
George, there's no time! Tell him your code! Shout out your code, man!!
Get well, get well soon we wish you to get well.
Don't you drag me into this! This is between you and her, and her. (indicating empty chair)
So as a result of your test being free of opium, I am reinstating you.
Another productive meeting. By the way, I saw that English Patient film last night. It was extraordinary.
Yes, that's the one! Good day Elaine. (Leaves.)
Morty. My stories are what sell these clothes.
Oh no, that doesnt matter now. That's a very nice jacket.
Elaine. I never knew Kennedy had such a temper.
You know George, growing up as a boy in Costa Rica, I heard a rumor that momma had taken a lover. Perhaps Bosco was this man's name.
So, I have two tickets for you (holds up the bits of card) to the Flying Sandos Brothers magic show.
Damn it, Elaine. That wasn't Zach. That was the yam-yam. Now, he is going cold turkey. (Ordering) And you will be at his side.
(Interrupting) How much would you take for the whole lot?
It's morning. Thanks for seeing me through the night. I'll make us a pot of coffee, George. Watch her, won't you?
Elaine! Excellent. I'd like you to meet a friend of mine, Irwin Lubeck.
Peterman here. What? Oh no. Alright, I'll be right there. (To George) It's my mother; she's at death's door. I just pray to God we can make it there in time.
Oh! no right away, chop, chop........Oh! a new cartoon....."I wish I was taller (hearty laugh) I'd like to see that complaint get rectified. (more laughs and he leaves)
Bob, we have a little baptism by fire for you, so to speak.
(Intrigued) The very pants I was returning. That's perfect irony! Elaine, that is interesting writing! (The intercom beeps)
Well, I see what's going on in here. I am smack dab in the middle of a good old fashioned cat fight.
(steps up to the podium, refreshed) Ahhh. I don't think I'll ever be able to forget Susie--ahhh. And most of all, I will never, forget that one night. Working late on the catalogue. Juuust the two of us. And we surrendered to temptation. And it was Pretty Good.
(Hangs up) There you are, Elaine. Go forth, and create. (Elaine gets up to leave) And, by the way, when you get to that chapter about my romantic escapades - feel free to toss yourself in the mix.
Elaine. I think I've been working you a little too hard, lately.
And so, I made an explosive out of chick peas, and I stopped that great rhino right in his tracks.
(emotional) And I thought I knew what love was.
Because, if I hear one more rattle - just one - your out on your can. And if you are undead - I'll find out about that too. (Exits)
Ah, the tickets are for tonight. So you and Bob can knock off a little early, so you both can get ready.
And I know you wouldn't be just having fun with his handicap. (staring away) That kind of cruelty would be grounds for dismissal.
That reminds me of the Hatian Voodoo rattle torture! You haven't gone over to their side have you?
Just Hold On a minute. Still One Short.
Elaine, I hope you're watching the clothes, because I can't take my eyes off the passion.
Well, that's pretty exciting. (Pause) Let's put that in the book.
Alright, people, I'd like to begin with a hearty hail and well-met good fellow, to Bob Grossberg, who's joining us from Business Affairs.
Ha ha ha ha...Oh, what a stirring little anthem of wellness.
Very soft, huge button flaps, cargo pockets, draw string waist, deep biswing vents in the back perfect for jumping into a gondola.
Fortunately, I still have George here to help me through this.
...And there, tucked into the river's bend was the object of my search. The Gwon-Jaya River market, fabrics and spices traded under a starlit sky. It was there that I discovered the Pamplona beret. Sizes seven-and-a-half through eight-and-three-quarters. Price? Thirty-five dollars.
Apparently Peggy--down in Design?--got into a liiiittle bit of a Tiff yesterday with somebody named, "Susie"?
We missed you at the get well party. Poor old Walt has a polyp in the duodenum. It's benign, but--ooh--still a bastard. Oh, Elaine, can you keep a secret?
That irreverence, that wit I'd recognize it anywhere. Some charlatan has stolen a Ziggy and passed it off as his own. I can prove it. Quick Elaine, to my archives.
It was the Peace Corps that gave me my start in this business. (nostalgic) Clothing the naked natives of Bantu Besh.
(looks at his watch) It's only five fifteen. So, later on that same day, I developed a great hankering for some wild honey...
My friends, a toast. As the wolly-haired Melanasians of Papua, New Guinea once said, (Makes a series of clicking and popping sounds. The music starts up) All right! Who's dancing? (No one makes a gesture that they intend to dance) No one? Alright, I'll just have to get things started. (Grabs a female employee, and starts dancing with her. The crowd is impressed)
...and I, of course, will return to mine. Kudos, Elaine, on a job... done.
Elaine, I have a question for you. Is the item still...with you?
Oh, and one more thing. You may have osteoporosis.
I don't believe that for a minute. Well, Elaine, it was good of you to stop by.
(slower and louder) Why don't you handle all the copy-editing?
Nonsense! (To Kramer) I have Benes' woderfully imaginative mind to spin my stories. You take back your tales, you vagabond!
Elaine, do you see this? Do you see what I'm holding in my hands?
Oh, Elaine. The toll road of denial is a long and dangerous one. The price? Your soul. Oh, and by the way, you have til' 500 to clear out your desk. You're fired.
Not a chance. I'm afraid I'll just have to find someone else to accompany me on my journey. The dark continent is no place for an addict, Elaine.
Mama, it's me. Jacopo. I'm here for you, mama.
I'm afraid the problem with Zach is more serious. He's back on the horse, Elaine. Smack. White palace. The Chinaman's nightcap.
Oh, no Elaine, stay. Lubeck here is the world's foremost appraiser of vintage pastry.
