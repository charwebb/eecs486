It's jammed! I'll slide it under the door,
Elaine. I never knew Kennedy had such a temper.
(Cutting her off) No buts, Elaine. Or I will strip you of your 'associate' status. (Goes to leave) Uh, P.S., the first twenty-four hours are the worst. Better bring a poncho.
I know what you're going through. I too once fell under the spell of opium. It was 1979. I was travelling the Yangtzee in search of a Mongolian horsehair vest. I had got to the market after sundown, all of the clothing traders had gone, but a different sort of trader still lurked about. "Just a taste," he said. That was all it took.
Morty. My stories are what sell these clothes.
I'm afraid I have some bad news, Elaine. It appears you will not be accompanying me to Africa.
Fortunately, I still have George here to help me through this.
Because, if I hear one more rattle - just one - your out on your can. And if you are undead - I'll find out about that too. (Exits)
(Turns on the T.V, and starts flipping through the channels) Oh damn. They changed the cable stations again.. just when I finally memorized them.
You're an errand girl, sent by grocery clerks, to collect a bill.
I understand, no hard feelings. George and I will miss your company. Fong? It will just be two this evening. George, we dine.
Oh, Elaine just called, she won't be joining us. Not to worry, I'll tell the maitre'd it'll just be the three bulls.
That's the best way to get someplace you've never been.
Elaine, I have a question for you. Is the item still...with you?
Damn it, Elaine. That wasn't Zach. That was the yam-yam. Now, he is going cold turkey. (Ordering) And you will be at his side.
Elaine, I hope you're watching the clothes, because I can't take my eyes off the passion.
(smiles and laughs) Ha ha ha. Funny you should ask, Elaine.
I would see no trouble in spending up to, say, ten thousand dollars. Have my secretary give you a signed cheque.
Oh! no right away, chop, chop........Oh! a new cartoon....."I wish I was taller (hearty laugh) I'd like to see that complaint get rectified. (more laughs and he leaves)
I'm afraid it's your urine, Elaine. You tested positive for opium.
Well, now that we have that cleared up.. why don't the three of us have lunch.
Elaine! Where's Susie? I want her to head up our new Fingerless Glove Division.
Elaine! Excellent. I'd like you to meet a friend of mine, Irwin Lubeck.
Elaine, what did you want to talk me about?
Well, I see what's going on in here. I am smack dab in the middle of a good old fashioned cat fight.
Elaine, according to your urine analysis, you're menopausal. you have the metabolism of a sixty-eight year old woman.
Well, I have a feeling that what you are about to go through is punishment enough. Dismissed.
Well, Elaine, has nothing but Good things to say about Susie.
I just spoke with her, Elaine. She's in bed.
And so, I made an explosive out of chick peas, and I stopped that great rhino right in his tracks.
Elaine? Guess what. I've decided to Form a Charitable Foundation, in Susie's honor. And as Susie's best friend, I want you to be involved.
Well, it started out nicely "I'm returning some pants." A very identifiable problem.. (turns page) "I set of down a train tunnel.".. (turns page) But that's where the story takes a most unappealing turn.
It just seems so cliched, and obvious. It's not interesting writing.
George, you're obviously lying, anyone can see that!
(steps up to the podium, refreshed) Ahhh. I don't think I'll ever be able to forget Susie--ahhh. And most of all, I will never, forget that one night. Working late on the catalogue. Juuust the two of us. And we surrendered to temptation. And it was Pretty Good.
Ah, the tickets are for tonight. So you and Bob can knock off a little early, so you both can get ready.
And I know you wouldn't be just having fun with his handicap. (staring away) That kind of cruelty would be grounds for dismissal.
Well, that's pretty exciting. (Pause) Let's put that in the book.
We missed you at the get well party. Poor old Walt has a polyp in the duodenum. It's benign, but--ooh--still a bastard. Oh, Elaine, can you keep a secret?
I saw a woman in our hallway wearing one of these as a top. (sits on the corner of the desk)What exquisite beauty, I ran down the hallway to talk to her, but the elevator door closed. It was not to be.Perhaps our paths will cross again some day.
I'm afraid the problem with Zach is more serious. He's back on the horse, Elaine. Smack. White palace. The Chinaman's nightcap.
Jaba! Bagama ma Jaba. Olymala Hungui. (The boy runs out of the room)
Apparently Peggy--down in Design?--got into a liiiittle bit of a Tiff yesterday with somebody named, "Susie"?
(returns) Flash of lightning Elaine I just realized why I like this cartoon so much.
Kramer, my friend, (Gestures to Elaine) consider Elaine at your disposal.
Ah, yes. Well this certainly looks like a lot of words. In record time. I'm very impressed ... with both of you.
3.. I don't know what that is.. where's my damn preview channel?
So, we pay off your friend, and it becomes a Peterman.
(slower and louder) Why don't you handle all the copy-editing?
Look, there's a man in there. Get out of there, you're in danger!
Oh, and one more thing. You may have osteoporosis.
But, unfortunately I will be out of town with my lady-friend and therefore unable to bid on the lot. I was hoping maybe you would go in my stead.
Unfortunately, I am also disgusted. This is incoherent drivel! This is a total redo. And I'm assuming I need it right away.
(looks at his watch) It's only five fifteen. So, later on that same day, I developed a great hankering for some wild honey...
Bob, we have a little baptism by fire for you, so to speak.
What does that have to do with my clubs?
I don't believe that for a minute. Well, Elaine, it was good of you to stop by.
Elaine, do you see this? Do you see what I'm holding in my hands?
(emotional) And I thought I knew what love was.
That's it! Drop everything. We're going right now.
Elaine, do you have a moment? It's about your lover.
One moment. I'm reading the most fascinating article on the most fascinating people of the year. Annnnnd, done. Oh, yes. I'm sorry I needed this so quickly (leafing through the pages). It must have been an awful lot of work. Thank you very much, you two.
She is The Best. What was your name again.
Elaine, up until a moment ago, I was convinced that I was on the receiving end of one of the oldest baker's grift in the books--The Entenmann's shim-sham.
Oh, no Elaine, stay. Lubeck here is the world's foremost appraiser of vintage pastry.
Very soft, huge button flaps, cargo pockets, draw string waist, deep biswing vents in the back perfect for jumping into a gondola.
George, there's no time! Tell him your code! Shout out your code, man!!
(quietly) Well, why didn't you say so in the first place? You're fired.
Don't you drag me into this! This is between you and her, and her. (indicating empty chair)
I'd be happy to Elaine (he starts reading the form as she hands him a pen)... but I will have to see this hat.
Ha ha, nonsense, George. Besides it gives me a chance to tell you about my latest trip to Burma where I discovered a very unusual corduroy.
Elaine, who among us hasn't snuck into the break room to nibble on a love newton?
That irreverence, that wit I'd recognize it anywhere. Some charlatan has stolen a Ziggy and passed it off as his own. I can prove it. Quick Elaine, to my archives.
Elaine, you're out of control. You need help.
Inside that small college boy minifridge is my latest acquisition. A slice of cake from the wedding of King Edward VIII to Wallis Simpson, circa 1937, price--$29,000.
That's right, Elaine. White lotus. Yam-yam. Shanghai Sally.
(Laughs) Kramer, my friend, that is one ripping good yarn.. (Hands Kramer a check)
You know George, growing up as a boy in Costa Rica, I heard a rumor that momma had taken a lover. Perhaps Bosco was this man's name.
Eh, never mind. (turns to Elaine) Elaine, you do it.
Oh, Elaine, we've covered all of that in the catalogue ad nauseum. No, I would like this book to be about my day-to-day life.
But Iiii never heard her Cries for Help. (sighs) An' nowww.. Susie is gone.
Oh, Elaine. George, when momma said 'Bosco' she must have been trying to communicate something, a legacy, a dying wish perhaps.
My friends, a toast. As the wolly-haired Melanasians of Papua, New Guinea once said, (Makes a series of clicking and popping sounds. The music starts up) All right! Who's dancing? (No one makes a gesture that they intend to dance) No one? Alright, I'll just have to get things started. (Grabs a female employee, and starts dancing with her. The crowd is impressed)
So as a result of your test being free of opium, I am reinstating you.
You want to know something? I no longer need them!
Oh no, that doesnt matter now. That's a very nice jacket.
Twenty thousand dollars!?! Elaine, that's twice the amount I authorised you to spend.
Nonsense! (To Kramer) I have Benes' woderfully imaginative mind to spin my stories. You take back your tales, you vagabond!
(upbeat) Oh, Elaine, this dry air is curing me like a Black Forest ham.
We're gonna sell this as a top. Here's the angle Zelda Fitzgerald, aaaand, somebody in the 20s, wearing this at wild parties, driving all the men crazy (tosses the bra on Elaines desk) Have it on my desk by the end of the week.
She's stuffed up, achy, and suffering from intense malaise.
(leans forward, whispers carefully) I feel the same way. (announcing) And that's why this foundation will meet around Your Schedule. Nights! Weekends! Every, Free Moment you have. (leaving, pats her shoulders confidently)
And, in a tiny way, I almost feel responsible. I'm the one who sent him to Thailand - in search of low-cost whistles. Filled his head with pseudoerotic tales of my own Opium excursions. Plus, I have him some phone numbers of places he could score near the hotel.
Then in the distance I heard the bulls. I began running as fast as I could. Fortunately I was wearing my Italian Captoe Oxfords. Sophisticated yet different; nothing to make a huge fuss about. Rich dark brown calfskin leather. Matching leather vent. Men's whole and half sizes 7 through 13. Price $135.00.
So, I have two tickets for you (holds up the bits of card) to the Flying Sandos Brothers magic show.
Momma. Just talk to her, George. The doctor seems to think it helps.
(Intrigued) The very pants I was returning. That's perfect irony! Elaine, that is interesting writing! (The intercom beeps)
So, anyway, effective immediately, Miss Benes will return to her old position, at her original salary...
Oh, I'll be inaugrating them this weekend, with none other than Ethel Kennedy. A woman whose triumph in the face of tragedy is exceeded only by her proclivity to procreate.
(Looking at his dying plant) Ohh, damn. I forgot to buy plant food again.. I'll bet I got a coupon for it. (Starts looking through a small coupon box)
(busting in) Not on my watch! (Grabs Kramer by the collar) I won't have you turning my office into a den of iniquity! Get your fix somewhere else!
That reminds me of the Hatian Voodoo rattle torture! You haven't gone over to their side have you?
You know what a huge fan I am of John F Kennedy.
well, I'm sure we'll come up with something. What do you say you and I order ourselves a pie? Do you like Lorenzo's?
Get well, get well soon we wish you to get well.
It's morning. Thanks for seeing me through the night. I'll make us a pot of coffee, George. Watch her, won't you?
Peterman here. What? Oh no. Alright, I'll be right there. (To George) It's my mother; she's at death's door. I just pray to God we can make it there in time.
Ha ha ha ha...Oh, what a stirring little anthem of wellness.
Now, down to business. (thoughtful) I have had this vision of a diaphanous rum-runner scarf.
Mama, it's me. Jacopo. I'm here for you, mama.
Nevertheless, Elaine. The House, of Peterman is in Disorder. First thing tomorrow morning I want to see you, Peggy, and, Susie right here, in my office.
The fire will eat up this entire block!
Another productive meeting. By the way, I saw that English Patient film last night. It was extraordinary.
Ohhh.. It's just a place to flop. (Sits in his recliner)
Sotheby's is having an auction of JFK's memorabilia. One item in particular has caught my eye. The presidential golf clubs. To me, they capture that indefinable romance that was Camelot.
All right, Lubeck. How much is she worth?
Elaine. I think I've been working you a little too hard, lately.
Do you know what happens to a butter-based frosting after six decades in a poorly ventilated English basement?
I wanna market this item as a new direction in women's fashion.
Yes, that's the one! Good day Elaine. (Leaves.)
Yes. Between you, me and the lamppost. And the desk. Peggy says this "Suze" isn't much of a Worker.
Alright, people, I'd like to begin with a hearty hail and well-met good fellow, to Bob Grossberg, who's joining us from Business Affairs.
(interrupting) There's no need to deny it, Elaine. I heard every word you said.
That infernal rattling sound that has plagued me these past two days - and I could not find the source. In my office, in the hallway. Even in the men's room! Shame on you, Elaine!
...And there, tucked into the river's bend was the object of my search. The Gwon-Jaya River market, fabrics and spices traded under a starlit sky. It was there that I discovered the Pamplona beret. Sizes seven-and-a-half through eight-and-three-quarters. Price? Thirty-five dollars.
...and I, of course, will return to mine. Kudos, Elaine, on a job... done.
