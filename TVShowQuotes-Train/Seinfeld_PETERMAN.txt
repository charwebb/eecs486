Peterman here. What? Oh no. Alright, I'll be right there. (To George) It's my mother; she's at death's door. I just pray to God we can make it there in time.
Well, it started out nicely "I'm returning some pants." A very identifiable problem.. (turns page) "I set of down a train tunnel.".. (turns page) But that's where the story takes a most unappealing turn.
Elaine, you're out of control. You need help.
So, we pay off your friend, and it becomes a Peterman.
Ohhh.. It's just a place to flop. (Sits in his recliner)
Oh, good lord.
Elaine, who among us hasn't snuck into the break room to nibble on a love newton?
(quietly) Well, why didn't you say so in the first place? You're fired.
I know what you're going through. I too once fell under the spell of opium. It was 1979. I was travelling the Yangtzee in search of a Mongolian horsehair vest. I had got to the market after sundown, all of the clothing traders had gone, but a different sort of trader still lurked about. "Just a taste," he said. That was all it took.
Elaine, did you hire this man?
Ha ha, nonsense, George. Besides it gives me a chance to tell you about my latest trip to Burma where I discovered a very unusual corduroy.
Unfortunately, I am also disgusted. This is incoherent drivel! This is a total redo. And I'm assuming I need it right away.
(puzzled) Who are you?
(smiles and laughs) Ha ha ha. Funny you should ask, Elaine.
(to Bob) I want you to handle all the fact-checking and the copy-editing for the new catalogue.
That's right, Elaine. White lotus. Yam-yam. Shanghai Sally.
Shake off the dew, my friend.
We're gonna sell this as a top. Here's the angle Zelda Fitzgerald, aaaand, somebody in the 20s, wearing this at wild parties, driving all the men crazy (tosses the bra on Elaines desk) Have it on my desk by the end of the week.
It's morning. Thanks for seeing me through the night. I'll make us a pot of coffee, George. Watch her, won't you?
(slower and louder) Why don't you handle all the copy-editing?
It's a Ziggy!
I saw a woman in our hallway wearing one of these as a top. (sits on the corner of the desk)What exquisite beauty, I ran down the hallway to talk to her, but the elevator door closed. It was not to be.Perhaps our paths will cross again some day.
So, anyway, effective immediately, Miss Benes will return to her old position, at her original salary...
I think not.
What is it?
Well, now that we have that cleared up.. why don't the three of us have lunch.
Oh, I'll be inaugrating them this weekend, with none other than Ethel Kennedy. A woman whose triumph in the face of tragedy is exceeded only by her proclivity to procreate.
Oh, and one more thing. You may have osteoporosis.
George, there's no time! Tell him your code! Shout out your code, man!!
Kramer, my friend, (Gestures to Elaine) consider Elaine at your disposal.
Elaine, I hope you're watching the clothes, because I can't take my eyes off the passion.
Oh! no right away, chop, chop........Oh! a new cartoon....."I wish I was taller (hearty laugh) I'd like to see that complaint get rectified. (more laughs and he leaves)
That reminds me of the Hatian Voodoo rattle torture! You haven't gone over to their side have you?
That's my coat.
(Cutting her off) No buts, Elaine. Or I will strip you of your 'associate' status. (Goes to leave) Uh, P.S., the first twenty-four hours are the worst. Better bring a poncho.
J. Peterman.
Bad news, people. Peggy is home sick.
See you on Monday.
(aghast) You haven't seen it?
Sotheby's is having an auction of JFK's memorabilia. One item in particular has caught my eye. The presidential golf clubs. To me, they capture that indefinable romance that was Camelot.
...And there, tucked into the river's bend was the object of my search. The Gwon-Jaya River market, fabrics and spices traded under a starlit sky. It was there that I discovered the Pamplona beret. Sizes seven-and-a-half through eight-and-three-quarters. Price? Thirty-five dollars.
Elaine, according to your urine analysis, you're menopausal. you have the metabolism of a sixty-eight year old woman.
Twenty thousand dollars!?! Elaine, that's twice the amount I authorised you to spend.
George, you're obviously lying, anyone can see that!
Well, where are they?
Another productive meeting. By the way, I saw that English Patient film last night. It was extraordinary.
Not a chance. I'm afraid I'll just have to find someone else to accompany me on my journey. The dark continent is no place for an addict, Elaine.
Ah, Fong has been most accommodating. Shall we?
Woof!
You know what a huge fan I am of John F Kennedy.
And, in a tiny way, I almost feel responsible. I'm the one who sent him to Thailand - in search of low-cost whistles. Filled his head with pseudoerotic tales of my own Opium excursions. Plus, I have him some phone numbers of places he could score near the hotel.
I'm afraid I have some bad news, Elaine. It appears you will not be accompanying me to Africa.
Oh, Elaine just called, she won't be joining us. Not to worry, I'll tell the maitre'd it'll just be the three bulls.
You want to know something? I no longer need them!
Well, Elaine, has nothing but Good things to say about Susie.
Where is she?!
...and I, of course, will return to mine. Kudos, Elaine, on a job... done.
So as a result of your test being free of opium, I am reinstating you.
Ah, yes. Well this certainly looks like a lot of words. In record time. I'm very impressed ... with both of you.
(returns) Flash of lightning Elaine I just realized why I like this cartoon so much.
Nevertheless, Elaine. The House, of Peterman is in Disorder. First thing tomorrow morning I want to see you, Peggy, and, Susie right here, in my office.
The horror ... the horror.
What does that have to do with my clubs?
Oh, Elaine. George, when momma said 'Bosco' she must have been trying to communicate something, a legacy, a dying wish perhaps.
It just seems so cliched, and obvious. It's not interesting writing.
Oh no, that doesnt matter now. That's a very nice jacket.
Momma. Just talk to her, George. The doctor seems to think it helps.
For the love of God!
Nonsense! (To Kramer) I have Benes' woderfully imaginative mind to spin my stories. You take back your tales, you vagabond!
(looks at his watch) It's only five fifteen. So, later on that same day, I developed a great hankering for some wild honey...
(louder still) Copy-editing!
Elaine, I'm afraid I have incurred yet another flat tire.
Doctor, how is she?
George, give me your ATM card!
Elaine! May I say a few words.
She's gone. Bosco?
(upbeat) Oh, Elaine, this dry air is curing me like a Black Forest ham.
Elaine, up until a moment ago, I was convinced that I was on the receiving end of one of the oldest baker's grift in the books--The Entenmann's shim-sham.
Bob, we have a little baptism by fire for you, so to speak.
I'd be happy to Elaine (he starts reading the form as she hands him a pen)... but I will have to see this hat.
No Elaine, that was gibberish.
Elaine.
Fortunately, I still have George here to help me through this.
You must be Jerry Seinfeld.
I just spoke with her, Elaine. She's in bed.
well, I'm sure we'll come up with something. What do you say you and I order ourselves a pie? Do you like Lorenzo's?
You do?
So did you have any trouble finding the place?
(Looking at his dying plant) Ohh, damn. I forgot to buy plant food again.. I'll bet I got a coupon for it. (Starts looking through a small coupon box)
All right, brace yourself, Lubeck. You are about to be launched via pastry back to the wedding of one of the most dashing and romantic Nazi sympathizers of the entire British Royal family.
But, unfortunately I will be out of town with my lady-friend and therefore unable to bid on the lot. I was hoping maybe you would go in my stead.
I'm afraid the problem with Zach is more serious. He's back on the horse, Elaine. Smack. White palace. The Chinaman's nightcap.
(surprised) Elaine. You don't like the movie?
(leans forward, whispers carefully) I feel the same way. (announcing) And that's why this foundation will meet around Your Schedule. Nights! Weekends! Every, Free Moment you have. (leaving, pats her shoulders confidently)
And so, I made an explosive out of chick peas, and I stopped that great rhino right in his tracks.
So, I have two tickets for you (holds up the bits of card) to the Flying Sandos Brothers magic show.
Elaine, what did you want to talk me about?
(Hangs up) There you are, Elaine. Go forth, and create. (Elaine gets up to leave) And, by the way, when you get to that chapter about my romantic escapades - feel free to toss yourself in the mix.
I don't believe that for a minute. Well, Elaine, it was good of you to stop by.
Are you an assassin?
And I know you wouldn't be just having fun with his handicap. (staring away) That kind of cruelty would be grounds for dismissal.
(steps up to the podium, refreshed) Ahhh. I don't think I'll ever be able to forget Susie--ahhh. And most of all, I will never, forget that one night. Working late on the catalogue. Juuust the two of us. And we surrendered to temptation. And it was Pretty Good.
Damn it, Elaine. That wasn't Zach. That was the yam-yam. Now, he is going cold turkey. (Ordering) And you will be at his side.
Elaine, do you see this? Do you see what I'm holding in my hands?
Elaine, what'd you think?
She is The Best. What was your name again.
Mmmmm--nah.
Inside that small college boy minifridge is my latest acquisition. A slice of cake from the wedding of King Edward VIII to Wallis Simpson, circa 1937, price--$29,000.
I'm afraid it's your urine, Elaine. You tested positive for opium.
Snag?
Do you know what happens to a butter-based frosting after six decades in a poorly ventilated English basement?
Elaine. I think I've been working you a little too hard, lately.
That's NOT bad!
It is a real hoot.
(Laughs) Kramer, my friend, that is one ripping good yarn.. (Hands Kramer a check)
Do they have a castle at Windsor?
That's the best way to get someplace you've never been.
Momma! What are you trying to say?
(Interested) You don't say.
Apparently Peggy--down in Design?--got into a liiiittle bit of a Tiff yesterday with somebody named, "Susie"?
(winks) Morty, you're out.
Elaine.
Yes, I'm J. Peterman.
That infernal rattling sound that has plagued me these past two days - and I could not find the source. In my office, in the hallway. Even in the men's room! Shame on you, Elaine!
Look, there's a man in there. Get out of there, you're in danger!
3.. I don't know what that is.. where's my damn preview channel?
Well, that's pretty exciting. (Pause) Let's put that in the book.
That irreverence, that wit I'd recognize it anywhere. Some charlatan has stolen a Ziggy and passed it off as his own. I can prove it. Quick Elaine, to my archives.
It's jammed! I'll slide it under the door,
Now, down to business. (thoughtful) I have had this vision of a diaphanous rum-runner scarf.
(interrupting) There's no need to deny it, Elaine. I heard every word you said.
My friends, a toast. As the wolly-haired Melanasians of Papua, New Guinea once said, (Makes a series of clicking and popping sounds. The music starts up) All right! Who's dancing? (No one makes a gesture that they intend to dance) No one? Alright, I'll just have to get things started. (Grabs a female employee, and starts dancing with her. The crowd is impressed)
Because, if I hear one more rattle - just one - your out on your can. And if you are undead - I'll find out about that too. (Exits)
George, give him your code!
I would see no trouble in spending up to, say, ten thousand dollars. Have my secretary give you a signed cheque.
Bosco. Bosco. Bosco.
That shirt. Where did you get it?
Ha ha ha ha...Oh, what a stirring little anthem of wellness.
I'll give you half that.
Elaine! Excellent. I'd like you to meet a friend of mine, Irwin Lubeck.
Mama, it's me. Jacopo. I'm here for you, mama.
(Interrupting) How much would you take for the whole lot?
Ha ha ha ha ha!$219,000! Lubeck, you glorious titwillow. You just made me a profit of $190,000.
Elaine. I never knew Kennedy had such a temper.
(Still flipping through the channels) 2.. CBS..
Get well, get well soon we wish you to get well.
(Intrigued) The very pants I was returning. That's perfect irony! Elaine, that is interesting writing! (The intercom beeps)
(excited) Elaine! You found the clubs. That's wonderful news. Where are they?
That noise. That's the noise!
Oh, Elaine. The toll road of denial is a long and dangerous one. The price? Your soul. Oh, and by the way, you have til' 500 to clear out your desk. You're fired.
Don't you drag me into this! This is between you and her, and her. (indicating empty chair)
I wanna market this item as a new direction in women's fashion.
Elaine! Where's Susie? I want her to head up our new Fingerless Glove Division.
It was the Peace Corps that gave me my start in this business. (nostalgic) Clothing the naked natives of Bantu Besh.
Just Hold On a minute. Still One Short.
The fire will eat up this entire block!
Oh, Elaine, we've covered all of that in the catalogue ad nauseum. No, I would like this book to be about my day-to-day life.
Oh, no Elaine, stay. Lubeck here is the world's foremost appraiser of vintage pastry.
We missed you at the get well party. Poor old Walt has a polyp in the duodenum. It's benign, but--ooh--still a bastard. Oh, Elaine, can you keep a secret?
Very soft, huge button flaps, cargo pockets, draw string waist, deep biswing vents in the back perfect for jumping into a gondola.
Yes. Between you, me and the lamppost. And the desk. Peggy says this "Suze" isn't much of a Worker.
You know George, growing up as a boy in Costa Rica, I heard a rumor that momma had taken a lover. Perhaps Bosco was this man's name.
Well, are they here?
Ah, the tickets are for tonight. So you and Bob can knock off a little early, so you both can get ready.
Until I remembered the videotape surveillance system that I installed to catch other-Walter using my latrine. But it also caught this.
You're an errand girl, sent by grocery clerks, to collect a bill.
George!
Morty. My stories are what sell these clothes.
Yes, that's the one! Good day Elaine. (Leaves.)
(emotional) And I thought I knew what love was.
Elaine, I have a question for you. Is the item still...with you?
I'm afraid I can't take you.
Name your price, man!
She's stuffed up, achy, and suffering from intense malaise.
