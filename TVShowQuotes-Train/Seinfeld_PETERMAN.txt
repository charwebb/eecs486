Elaine, do you have a moment? It's about your lover.
You want to know something? I no longer need them!
(excited) Elaine! You found the clubs. That's wonderful news. Where are they?
That infernal rattling sound that has plagued me these past two days - and I could not find the source. In my office, in the hallway. Even in the men's room! Shame on you, Elaine!
Elaine? Guess what. I've decided to Form a Charitable Foundation, in Susie's honor. And as Susie's best friend, I want you to be involved.
What is it?
Oh, Elaine. George, when momma said 'Bosco' she must have been trying to communicate something, a legacy, a dying wish perhaps.
(quietly) Well, why didn't you say so in the first place? You're fired.
It's jammed! I'll slide it under the door,
You know George, growing up as a boy in Costa Rica, I heard a rumor that momma had taken a lover. Perhaps Bosco was this man's name.
I just spoke with her, Elaine. She's in bed.
(Cutting her off) No buts, Elaine. Or I will strip you of your 'associate' status. (Goes to leave) Uh, P.S., the first twenty-four hours are the worst. Better bring a poncho.
So, anyway, effective immediately, Miss Benes will return to her old position, at her original salary...
I think not.
We missed you at the get well party. Poor old Walt has a polyp in the duodenum. It's benign, but--ooh--still a bastard. Oh, Elaine, can you keep a secret?
Inside that small college boy minifridge is my latest acquisition. A slice of cake from the wedding of King Edward VIII to Wallis Simpson, circa 1937, price--$29,000.
Bob, we have a little baptism by fire for you, so to speak.
Elaine, what did you want to talk me about?
Oh, Elaine, we've covered all of that in the catalogue ad nauseum. No, I would like this book to be about my day-to-day life.
Jaba! Bagama ma Jaba. Olymala Hungui. (The boy runs out of the room)
Oh, and one more thing. You may have osteoporosis.
Elaine. I never knew Kennedy had such a temper.
It's morning. Thanks for seeing me through the night. I'll make us a pot of coffee, George. Watch her, won't you?
Mama, it's me. Jacopo. I'm here for you, mama.
Eh, never mind. (turns to Elaine) Elaine, you do it.
Yes, that's the one! Good day Elaine. (Leaves.)
Shake off the dew, my friend.
No Elaine, that was gibberish.
Peterman here. What? Oh no. Alright, I'll be right there. (To George) It's my mother; she's at death's door. I just pray to God we can make it there in time.
Where is she?!
I wanna market this item as a new direction in women's fashion.
She's stuffed up, achy, and suffering from intense malaise.
And I know you wouldn't be just having fun with his handicap. (staring away) That kind of cruelty would be grounds for dismissal.
Well, I have a feeling that what you are about to go through is punishment enough. Dismissed.
For the love of God!
Elaine, according to your urine analysis, you're menopausal. you have the metabolism of a sixty-eight year old woman.
George, you're obviously lying, anyone can see that!
Until I remembered the videotape surveillance system that I installed to catch other-Walter using my latrine. But it also caught this.
Bad news, people. Peggy is home sick.
(winks) Morty, you're out.
I don't believe that for a minute. Well, Elaine, it was good of you to stop by.
All right, Lubeck. How much is she worth?
Well, now that we have that cleared up.. why don't the three of us have lunch.
Oh no, that doesnt matter now. That's a very nice jacket.
Elaine, what'd you think?
I'll give you half that.
Ah, the tickets are for tonight. So you and Bob can knock off a little early, so you both can get ready.
The horror ... the horror.
...and I, of course, will return to mine. Kudos, Elaine, on a job... done.
I'd be happy to Elaine (he starts reading the form as she hands him a pen)... but I will have to see this hat.
She is The Best. What was your name again.
Morty. My stories are what sell these clothes.
(Still flipping through the channels) 2.. CBS..
(to Bob) I want you to handle all the fact-checking and the copy-editing for the new catalogue.
Then in the distance I heard the bulls. I began running as fast as I could. Fortunately I was wearing my Italian Captoe Oxfords. Sophisticated yet different; nothing to make a huge fuss about. Rich dark brown calfskin leather. Matching leather vent. Men's whole and half sizes 7 through 13. Price $135.00.
Ha ha ha ha...Oh, what a stirring little anthem of wellness.
Unfortunately, I am also disgusted. This is incoherent drivel! This is a total redo. And I'm assuming I need it right away.
That reminds me of the Hatian Voodoo rattle torture! You haven't gone over to their side have you?
One moment. I'm reading the most fascinating article on the most fascinating people of the year. Annnnnd, done. Oh, yes. I'm sorry I needed this so quickly (leafing through the pages). It must have been an awful lot of work. Thank you very much, you two.
Look, there's a man in there. Get out of there, you're in danger!
Oh! no right away, chop, chop........Oh! a new cartoon....."I wish I was taller (hearty laugh) I'd like to see that complaint get rectified. (more laughs and he leaves)
That shirt. Where did you get it?
(leans forward, whispers carefully) I feel the same way. (announcing) And that's why this foundation will meet around Your Schedule. Nights! Weekends! Every, Free Moment you have. (leaving, pats her shoulders confidently)
Snag?
Elaine, did you hire this man?
(Interested) You don't say.
My friends, a toast. As the wolly-haired Melanasians of Papua, New Guinea once said, (Makes a series of clicking and popping sounds. The music starts up) All right! Who's dancing? (No one makes a gesture that they intend to dance) No one? Alright, I'll just have to get things started. (Grabs a female employee, and starts dancing with her. The crowd is impressed)
You know what a huge fan I am of John F Kennedy.
Yes, I'm J. Peterman.
But, unfortunately I will be out of town with my lady-friend and therefore unable to bid on the lot. I was hoping maybe you would go in my stead.
Elaine, you're out of control. You need help.
J. Peterman.
Very soft, huge button flaps, cargo pockets, draw string waist, deep biswing vents in the back perfect for jumping into a gondola.
So, we pay off your friend, and it becomes a Peterman.
Elaine, do you see this? Do you see what I'm holding in my hands?
Name your price, man!
Well, Elaine, has nothing but Good things to say about Susie.
Ha ha ha ha ha!$219,000! Lubeck, you glorious titwillow. You just made me a profit of $190,000.
Elaine, up until a moment ago, I was convinced that I was on the receiving end of one of the oldest baker's grift in the books--The Entenmann's shim-sham.
Well, where are they?
You do?
It was the Peace Corps that gave me my start in this business. (nostalgic) Clothing the naked natives of Bantu Besh.
Elaine! Excellent. I'd like you to meet a friend of mine, Irwin Lubeck.
(Interrupting) How much would you take for the whole lot?
Bosco. Bosco. Bosco.
Well, I see what's going on in here. I am smack dab in the middle of a good old fashioned cat fight.
(aghast) You haven't seen it?
(Hangs up) There you are, Elaine. Go forth, and create. (Elaine gets up to leave) And, by the way, when you get to that chapter about my romantic escapades - feel free to toss yourself in the mix.
Who.
Elaine! May I say a few words.
(surprised) Elaine. You don't like the movie?
Sotheby's is having an auction of JFK's memorabilia. One item in particular has caught my eye. The presidential golf clubs. To me, they capture that indefinable romance that was Camelot.
Elaine.
So did you have any trouble finding the place?
Well, that's pretty exciting. (Pause) Let's put that in the book.
That's right, Elaine. White lotus. Yam-yam. Shanghai Sally.
(puzzled) Who are you?
George!
Ah, Fong has been most accommodating. Shall we?
Momma. Just talk to her, George. The doctor seems to think it helps.
Now, down to business. (thoughtful) I have had this vision of a diaphanous rum-runner scarf.
It is a real hoot.
(Laughs) Kramer, my friend, that is one ripping good yarn.. (Hands Kramer a check)
(emotional) And I thought I knew what love was.
(returns) Flash of lightning Elaine I just realized why I like this cartoon so much.
I understand, no hard feelings. George and I will miss your company. Fong? It will just be two this evening. George, we dine.
...And there, tucked into the river's bend was the object of my search. The Gwon-Jaya River market, fabrics and spices traded under a starlit sky. It was there that I discovered the Pamplona beret. Sizes seven-and-a-half through eight-and-three-quarters. Price? Thirty-five dollars.
Momma! What are you trying to say?
(Looking at his dying plant) Ohh, damn. I forgot to buy plant food again.. I'll bet I got a coupon for it. (Starts looking through a small coupon box)
It's a Ziggy!
All right, brace yourself, Lubeck. You are about to be launched via pastry back to the wedding of one of the most dashing and romantic Nazi sympathizers of the entire British Royal family.
(interrupting) There's no need to deny it, Elaine. I heard every word you said.
We're gonna sell this as a top. Here's the angle Zelda Fitzgerald, aaaand, somebody in the 20s, wearing this at wild parties, driving all the men crazy (tosses the bra on Elaines desk) Have it on my desk by the end of the week.
But Iiii never heard her Cries for Help. (sighs) An' nowww.. Susie is gone.
That's the best way to get someplace you've never been.
So as a result of your test being free of opium, I am reinstating you.
That noise. That's the noise!
Don't you drag me into this! This is between you and her, and her. (indicating empty chair)
Fortunately, I still have George here to help me through this.
See you on Monday.
Ohhh.. It's just a place to flop. (Sits in his recliner)
Elaine.
Elaine, I'm afraid I have incurred yet another flat tire.
Elaine, who among us hasn't snuck into the break room to nibble on a love newton?
Well, are they here?
(upbeat) Oh, Elaine, this dry air is curing me like a Black Forest ham.
Oh, good lord.
Do they have a castle at Windsor?
You're an errand girl, sent by grocery clerks, to collect a bill.
Elaine, I have a question for you. Is the item still...with you?
And, in a tiny way, I almost feel responsible. I'm the one who sent him to Thailand - in search of low-cost whistles. Filled his head with pseudoerotic tales of my own Opium excursions. Plus, I have him some phone numbers of places he could score near the hotel.
George, give him your code!
And so, I made an explosive out of chick peas, and I stopped that great rhino right in his tracks.
Not a chance. I'm afraid I'll just have to find someone else to accompany me on my journey. The dark continent is no place for an addict, Elaine.
(smiles and laughs) Ha ha ha. Funny you should ask, Elaine.
Kramer, my friend, (Gestures to Elaine) consider Elaine at your disposal.
Have you been crying?
(looks at his watch) It's only five fifteen. So, later on that same day, I developed a great hankering for some wild honey...
Because, if I hear one more rattle - just one - your out on your can. And if you are undead - I'll find out about that too. (Exits)
(slower and louder) Why don't you handle all the copy-editing?
I know what you're going through. I too once fell under the spell of opium. It was 1979. I was travelling the Yangtzee in search of a Mongolian horsehair vest. I had got to the market after sundown, all of the clothing traders had gone, but a different sort of trader still lurked about. "Just a taste," he said. That was all it took.
Oh, no Elaine, stay. Lubeck here is the world's foremost appraiser of vintage pastry.
Twenty thousand dollars!?! Elaine, that's twice the amount I authorised you to spend.
That's it! Drop everything. We're going right now.
Woof!
(busting in) Not on my watch! (Grabs Kramer by the collar) I won't have you turning my office into a den of iniquity! Get your fix somewhere else!
(steps up to the podium, refreshed) Ahhh. I don't think I'll ever be able to forget Susie--ahhh. And most of all, I will never, forget that one night. Working late on the catalogue. Juuust the two of us. And we surrendered to temptation. And it was Pretty Good.
(Intrigued) The very pants I was returning. That's perfect irony! Elaine, that is interesting writing! (The intercom beeps)
What does that have to do with my clubs?
Nevertheless, Elaine. The House, of Peterman is in Disorder. First thing tomorrow morning I want to see you, Peggy, and, Susie right here, in my office.
(Picks up the phone) Peterman, here.
(Turns on the T.V, and starts flipping through the channels) Oh damn. They changed the cable stations again.. just when I finally memorized them.
All right, Elaine.
You must be Jerry Seinfeld.
Do you know what happens to a butter-based frosting after six decades in a poorly ventilated English basement?
Nonsense! (To Kramer) I have Benes' woderfully imaginative mind to spin my stories. You take back your tales, you vagabond!
Are you an assassin?
Elaine. I think I've been working you a little too hard, lately.
I saw a woman in our hallway wearing one of these as a top. (sits on the corner of the desk)What exquisite beauty, I ran down the hallway to talk to her, but the elevator door closed. It was not to be.Perhaps our paths will cross again some day.
3.. I don't know what that is.. where's my damn preview channel?
(louder still) Copy-editing!
Apparently Peggy--down in Design?--got into a liiiittle bit of a Tiff yesterday with somebody named, "Susie"?
I'm afraid the problem with Zach is more serious. He's back on the horse, Elaine. Smack. White palace. The Chinaman's nightcap.
well, I'm sure we'll come up with something. What do you say you and I order ourselves a pie? Do you like Lorenzo's?
Oh, Elaine. The toll road of denial is a long and dangerous one. The price? Your soul. Oh, and by the way, you have til' 500 to clear out your desk. You're fired.
It just seems so cliched, and obvious. It's not interesting writing.
Well, it started out nicely "I'm returning some pants." A very identifiable problem.. (turns page) "I set of down a train tunnel.".. (turns page) But that's where the story takes a most unappealing turn.
Elaine! Where's Susie? I want her to head up our new Fingerless Glove Division.
I'm afraid I can't take you.
That's my coat.
Yes. Between you, me and the lamppost. And the desk. Peggy says this "Suze" isn't much of a Worker.
The fire will eat up this entire block!
Doctor, how is she?
Elaine, I hope you're watching the clothes, because I can't take my eyes off the passion.
