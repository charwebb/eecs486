She is The Best. What was your name again.
Ah, yes. Well this certainly looks like a lot of words. In record time. I'm very impressed ... with both of you.
(smiles and laughs) Ha ha ha. Funny you should ask, Elaine.
My friends, a toast. As the wolly-haired Melanasians of Papua, New Guinea once said, (Makes a series of clicking and popping sounds. The music starts up) All right! Who's dancing? (No one makes a gesture that they intend to dance) No one? Alright, I'll just have to get things started. (Grabs a female employee, and starts dancing with her. The crowd is impressed)
(to Bob) I want you to handle all the fact-checking and the copy-editing for the new catalogue.
You know what a huge fan I am of John F Kennedy.
Well, it started out nicely "I'm returning some pants." A very identifiable problem.. (turns page) "I set of down a train tunnel.".. (turns page) But that's where the story takes a most unappealing turn.
I just spoke with her, Elaine. She's in bed.
Very soft, huge button flaps, cargo pockets, draw string waist, deep biswing vents in the back perfect for jumping into a gondola.
(Interrupting) How much would you take for the whole lot?
Elaine, do you have a moment? It's about your lover.
I would see no trouble in spending up to, say, ten thousand dollars. Have my secretary give you a signed cheque.
That reminds me of the Hatian Voodoo rattle torture! You haven't gone over to their side have you?
(Laughs) Kramer, my friend, that is one ripping good yarn.. (Hands Kramer a check)
Apparently Peggy--down in Design?--got into a liiiittle bit of a Tiff yesterday with somebody named, "Susie"?
It's morning. Thanks for seeing me through the night. I'll make us a pot of coffee, George. Watch her, won't you?
(busting in) Not on my watch! (Grabs Kramer by the collar) I won't have you turning my office into a den of iniquity! Get your fix somewhere else!
(looks at his watch) It's only five fifteen. So, later on that same day, I developed a great hankering for some wild honey...
Oh, Elaine. George, when momma said 'Bosco' she must have been trying to communicate something, a legacy, a dying wish perhaps.
That irreverence, that wit I'd recognize it anywhere. Some charlatan has stolen a Ziggy and passed it off as his own. I can prove it. Quick Elaine, to my archives.
(Turns on the T.V, and starts flipping through the channels) Oh damn. They changed the cable stations again.. just when I finally memorized them.
I'm afraid I have some bad news, Elaine. It appears you will not be accompanying me to Africa.
Kramer, my friend, (Gestures to Elaine) consider Elaine at your disposal.
Yes. Between you, me and the lamppost. And the desk. Peggy says this "Suze" isn't much of a Worker.
All right, Lubeck. How much is she worth?
That's it! Drop everything. We're going right now.
Jaba! Bagama ma Jaba. Olymala Hungui. (The boy runs out of the room)
Now, down to business. (thoughtful) I have had this vision of a diaphanous rum-runner scarf.
Ha ha ha ha ha!$219,000! Lubeck, you glorious titwillow. You just made me a profit of $190,000.
You know George, growing up as a boy in Costa Rica, I heard a rumor that momma had taken a lover. Perhaps Bosco was this man's name.
Elaine! Excellent. I'd like you to meet a friend of mine, Irwin Lubeck.
Oh, no Elaine, stay. Lubeck here is the world's foremost appraiser of vintage pastry.
It just seems so cliched, and obvious. It's not interesting writing.
So as a result of your test being free of opium, I am reinstating you.
Look, there's a man in there. Get out of there, you're in danger!
Not a chance. I'm afraid I'll just have to find someone else to accompany me on my journey. The dark continent is no place for an addict, Elaine.
(quietly) Well, why didn't you say so in the first place? You're fired.
So, anyway, effective immediately, Miss Benes will return to her old position, at her original salary...
Oh, Elaine. The toll road of denial is a long and dangerous one. The price? Your soul. Oh, and by the way, you have til' 500 to clear out your desk. You're fired.
I'd be happy to Elaine (he starts reading the form as she hands him a pen)... but I will have to see this hat.
(Looking at his dying plant) Ohh, damn. I forgot to buy plant food again.. I'll bet I got a coupon for it. (Starts looking through a small coupon box)
Ah, the tickets are for tonight. So you and Bob can knock off a little early, so you both can get ready.
(Intrigued) The very pants I was returning. That's perfect irony! Elaine, that is interesting writing! (The intercom beeps)
That's the best way to get someplace you've never been.
Elaine, I have a question for you. Is the item still...with you?
(Cutting her off) No buts, Elaine. Or I will strip you of your 'associate' status. (Goes to leave) Uh, P.S., the first twenty-four hours are the worst. Better bring a poncho.
I understand, no hard feelings. George and I will miss your company. Fong? It will just be two this evening. George, we dine.
...and I, of course, will return to mine. Kudos, Elaine, on a job... done.
(returns) Flash of lightning Elaine I just realized why I like this cartoon so much.
I know what you're going through. I too once fell under the spell of opium. It was 1979. I was travelling the Yangtzee in search of a Mongolian horsehair vest. I had got to the market after sundown, all of the clothing traders had gone, but a different sort of trader still lurked about. "Just a taste," he said. That was all it took.
Well, I have a feeling that what you are about to go through is punishment enough. Dismissed.
Elaine, I'm afraid I have incurred yet another flat tire.
Nevertheless, Elaine. The House, of Peterman is in Disorder. First thing tomorrow morning I want to see you, Peggy, and, Susie right here, in my office.
Ha ha, nonsense, George. Besides it gives me a chance to tell you about my latest trip to Burma where I discovered a very unusual corduroy.
Do you know what happens to a butter-based frosting after six decades in a poorly ventilated English basement?
Elaine, you're out of control. You need help.
Oh, Elaine, we've covered all of that in the catalogue ad nauseum. No, I would like this book to be about my day-to-day life.
I don't believe that for a minute. Well, Elaine, it was good of you to stop by.
Well, I see what's going on in here. I am smack dab in the middle of a good old fashioned cat fight.
...And there, tucked into the river's bend was the object of my search. The Gwon-Jaya River market, fabrics and spices traded under a starlit sky. It was there that I discovered the Pamplona beret. Sizes seven-and-a-half through eight-and-three-quarters. Price? Thirty-five dollars.
Twenty thousand dollars!?! Elaine, that's twice the amount I authorised you to spend.
So, I have two tickets for you (holds up the bits of card) to the Flying Sandos Brothers magic show.
Ha ha ha ha...Oh, what a stirring little anthem of wellness.
I'm afraid the problem with Zach is more serious. He's back on the horse, Elaine. Smack. White palace. The Chinaman's nightcap.
I saw a woman in our hallway wearing one of these as a top. (sits on the corner of the desk)What exquisite beauty, I ran down the hallway to talk to her, but the elevator door closed. It was not to be.Perhaps our paths will cross again some day.
So did you have any trouble finding the place?
Bob, we have a little baptism by fire for you, so to speak.
Oh! no right away, chop, chop........Oh! a new cartoon....."I wish I was taller (hearty laugh) I'd like to see that complaint get rectified. (more laughs and he leaves)
Oh, and one more thing. You may have osteoporosis.
George, you're obviously lying, anyone can see that!
Oh, I'll be inaugrating them this weekend, with none other than Ethel Kennedy. A woman whose triumph in the face of tragedy is exceeded only by her proclivity to procreate.
Elaine, what did you want to talk me about?
Elaine? Guess what. I've decided to Form a Charitable Foundation, in Susie's honor. And as Susie's best friend, I want you to be involved.
And, in a tiny way, I almost feel responsible. I'm the one who sent him to Thailand - in search of low-cost whistles. Filled his head with pseudoerotic tales of my own Opium excursions. Plus, I have him some phone numbers of places he could score near the hotel.
Yes, that's the one! Good day Elaine. (Leaves.)
Momma. Just talk to her, George. The doctor seems to think it helps.
The fire will eat up this entire block!
Don't you drag me into this! This is between you and her, and her. (indicating empty chair)
George, there's no time! Tell him your code! Shout out your code, man!!
Damn it, Elaine. That wasn't Zach. That was the yam-yam. Now, he is going cold turkey. (Ordering) And you will be at his side.
You want to know something? I no longer need them!
You're an errand girl, sent by grocery clerks, to collect a bill.
Alright, people, I'd like to begin with a hearty hail and well-met good fellow, to Bob Grossberg, who's joining us from Business Affairs.
That's right, Elaine. White lotus. Yam-yam. Shanghai Sally.
Just Hold On a minute. Still One Short.
Eh, never mind. (turns to Elaine) Elaine, you do it.
She's stuffed up, achy, and suffering from intense malaise.
Elaine, do you see this? Do you see what I'm holding in my hands?
I wanna market this item as a new direction in women's fashion.
Then in the distance I heard the bulls. I began running as fast as I could. Fortunately I was wearing my Italian Captoe Oxfords. Sophisticated yet different; nothing to make a huge fuss about. Rich dark brown calfskin leather. Matching leather vent. Men's whole and half sizes 7 through 13. Price $135.00.
Well, now that we have that cleared up.. why don't the three of us have lunch.
And I know you wouldn't be just having fun with his handicap. (staring away) That kind of cruelty would be grounds for dismissal.
(Hangs up) There you are, Elaine. Go forth, and create. (Elaine gets up to leave) And, by the way, when you get to that chapter about my romantic escapades - feel free to toss yourself in the mix.
Elaine, who among us hasn't snuck into the break room to nibble on a love newton?
We're gonna sell this as a top. Here's the angle Zelda Fitzgerald, aaaand, somebody in the 20s, wearing this at wild parties, driving all the men crazy (tosses the bra on Elaines desk) Have it on my desk by the end of the week.
Morty. My stories are what sell these clothes.
(excited) Elaine! You found the clubs. That's wonderful news. Where are they?
Ah, Fong has been most accommodating. Shall we?
All right, brace yourself, Lubeck. You are about to be launched via pastry back to the wedding of one of the most dashing and romantic Nazi sympathizers of the entire British Royal family.
One moment. I'm reading the most fascinating article on the most fascinating people of the year. Annnnnd, done. Oh, yes. I'm sorry I needed this so quickly (leafing through the pages). It must have been an awful lot of work. Thank you very much, you two.
(upbeat) Oh, Elaine, this dry air is curing me like a Black Forest ham.
Fortunately, I still have George here to help me through this.
Oh no, that doesnt matter now. That's a very nice jacket.
(leans forward, whispers carefully) I feel the same way. (announcing) And that's why this foundation will meet around Your Schedule. Nights! Weekends! Every, Free Moment you have. (leaving, pats her shoulders confidently)
Nonsense! (To Kramer) I have Benes' woderfully imaginative mind to spin my stories. You take back your tales, you vagabond!
Inside that small college boy minifridge is my latest acquisition. A slice of cake from the wedding of King Edward VIII to Wallis Simpson, circa 1937, price--$29,000.
Elaine, I hope you're watching the clothes, because I can't take my eyes off the passion.
(slower and louder) Why don't you handle all the copy-editing?
Peterman here. What? Oh no. Alright, I'll be right there. (To George) It's my mother; she's at death's door. I just pray to God we can make it there in time.
Elaine! Where's Susie? I want her to head up our new Fingerless Glove Division.
Oh, Elaine just called, she won't be joining us. Not to worry, I'll tell the maitre'd it'll just be the three bulls.
What does that have to do with my clubs?
But Iiii never heard her Cries for Help. (sighs) An' nowww.. Susie is gone.
Elaine, up until a moment ago, I was convinced that I was on the receiving end of one of the oldest baker's grift in the books--The Entenmann's shim-sham.
And so, I made an explosive out of chick peas, and I stopped that great rhino right in his tracks.
Elaine, according to your urine analysis, you're menopausal. you have the metabolism of a sixty-eight year old woman.
Mama, it's me. Jacopo. I'm here for you, mama.
Until I remembered the videotape surveillance system that I installed to catch other-Walter using my latrine. But it also caught this.
(interrupting) There's no need to deny it, Elaine. I heard every word you said.
So, we pay off your friend, and it becomes a Peterman.
Unfortunately, I am also disgusted. This is incoherent drivel! This is a total redo. And I'm assuming I need it right away.
(steps up to the podium, refreshed) Ahhh. I don't think I'll ever be able to forget Susie--ahhh. And most of all, I will never, forget that one night. Working late on the catalogue. Juuust the two of us. And we surrendered to temptation. And it was Pretty Good.
But, unfortunately I will be out of town with my lady-friend and therefore unable to bid on the lot. I was hoping maybe you would go in my stead.
Ohhh.. It's just a place to flop. (Sits in his recliner)
I'm afraid it's your urine, Elaine. You tested positive for opium.
Because, if I hear one more rattle - just one - your out on your can. And if you are undead - I'll find out about that too. (Exits)
