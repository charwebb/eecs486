Alright, people, I'd like to begin with a hearty hail and well-met good fellow, to Bob Grossberg, who's joining us from Business Affairs.
(leans forward, whispers carefully) I feel the same way. (announcing) And that's why this foundation will meet around Your Schedule. Nights! Weekends! Every, Free Moment you have. (leaving, pats her shoulders confidently)
(Cutting her off) No buts, Elaine. Or I will strip you of your 'associate' status. (Goes to leave) Uh, P.S., the first twenty-four hours are the worst. Better bring a poncho.
Oh, Elaine. The toll road of denial is a long and dangerous one. The price? Your soul. Oh, and by the way, you have til' 500 to clear out your desk. You're fired.
Elaine! Excellent. I'd like you to meet a friend of mine, Irwin Lubeck.
George, there's no time! Tell him your code! Shout out your code, man!!
Elaine? Guess what. I've decided to Form a Charitable Foundation, in Susie's honor. And as Susie's best friend, I want you to be involved.
You know what a huge fan I am of John F Kennedy.
Get well, get well soon we wish you to get well.
Sotheby's is having an auction of JFK's memorabilia. One item in particular has caught my eye. The presidential golf clubs. To me, they capture that indefinable romance that was Camelot.
I don't believe that for a minute. Well, Elaine, it was good of you to stop by.
Elaine, up until a moment ago, I was convinced that I was on the receiving end of one of the oldest baker's grift in the books--The Entenmann's shim-sham.
Well, Elaine, has nothing but Good things to say about Susie.
Yes. Between you, me and the lamppost. And the desk. Peggy says this "Suze" isn't much of a Worker.
Ah, Fong has been most accommodating. Shall we?
It just seems so cliched, and obvious. It's not interesting writing.
That's it! Drop everything. We're going right now.
Elaine, what did you want to talk me about?
My friends, a toast. As the wolly-haired Melanasians of Papua, New Guinea once said, (Makes a series of clicking and popping sounds. The music starts up) All right! Who's dancing? (No one makes a gesture that they intend to dance) No one? Alright, I'll just have to get things started. (Grabs a female employee, and starts dancing with her. The crowd is impressed)
I wanna market this item as a new direction in women's fashion.
Until I remembered the videotape surveillance system that I installed to catch other-Walter using my latrine. But it also caught this.
Kramer, my friend, (Gestures to Elaine) consider Elaine at your disposal.
(quietly) Well, why didn't you say so in the first place? You're fired.
Ohhh.. It's just a place to flop. (Sits in his recliner)
And so, I made an explosive out of chick peas, and I stopped that great rhino right in his tracks.
Well, I see what's going on in here. I am smack dab in the middle of a good old fashioned cat fight.
All right, Lubeck. How much is she worth?
Not a chance. I'm afraid I'll just have to find someone else to accompany me on my journey. The dark continent is no place for an addict, Elaine.
(steps up to the podium, refreshed) Ahhh. I don't think I'll ever be able to forget Susie--ahhh. And most of all, I will never, forget that one night. Working late on the catalogue. Juuust the two of us. And we surrendered to temptation. And it was Pretty Good.
Well, that's pretty exciting. (Pause) Let's put that in the book.
We missed you at the get well party. Poor old Walt has a polyp in the duodenum. It's benign, but--ooh--still a bastard. Oh, Elaine, can you keep a secret?
George, you're obviously lying, anyone can see that!
Elaine, I hope you're watching the clothes, because I can't take my eyes off the passion.
Elaine. I never knew Kennedy had such a temper.
Eh, never mind. (turns to Elaine) Elaine, you do it.
What does that have to do with my clubs?
Mama, it's me. Jacopo. I'm here for you, mama.
Peterman here. What? Oh no. Alright, I'll be right there. (To George) It's my mother; she's at death's door. I just pray to God we can make it there in time.
Damn it, Elaine. That wasn't Zach. That was the yam-yam. Now, he is going cold turkey. (Ordering) And you will be at his side.
Bob, we have a little baptism by fire for you, so to speak.
Oh, Elaine just called, she won't be joining us. Not to worry, I'll tell the maitre'd it'll just be the three bulls.
I'm afraid it's your urine, Elaine. You tested positive for opium.
Oh! no right away, chop, chop........Oh! a new cartoon....."I wish I was taller (hearty laugh) I'd like to see that complaint get rectified. (more laughs and he leaves)
Nevertheless, Elaine. The House, of Peterman is in Disorder. First thing tomorrow morning I want to see you, Peggy, and, Susie right here, in my office.
She's stuffed up, achy, and suffering from intense malaise.
She is The Best. What was your name again.
It's morning. Thanks for seeing me through the night. I'll make us a pot of coffee, George. Watch her, won't you?
3.. I don't know what that is.. where's my damn preview channel?
Look, there's a man in there. Get out of there, you're in danger!
I would see no trouble in spending up to, say, ten thousand dollars. Have my secretary give you a signed cheque.
Yes, that's the one! Good day Elaine. (Leaves.)
Elaine. I think I've been working you a little too hard, lately.
Well, now that we have that cleared up.. why don't the three of us have lunch.
(Interrupting) How much would you take for the whole lot?
So as a result of your test being free of opium, I am reinstating you.
Ah, yes. Well this certainly looks like a lot of words. In record time. I'm very impressed ... with both of you.
All right, brace yourself, Lubeck. You are about to be launched via pastry back to the wedding of one of the most dashing and romantic Nazi sympathizers of the entire British Royal family.
It was the Peace Corps that gave me my start in this business. (nostalgic) Clothing the naked natives of Bantu Besh.
I understand, no hard feelings. George and I will miss your company. Fong? It will just be two this evening. George, we dine.
(excited) Elaine! You found the clubs. That's wonderful news. Where are they?
Well, I have a feeling that what you are about to go through is punishment enough. Dismissed.
But Iiii never heard her Cries for Help. (sighs) An' nowww.. Susie is gone.
Nonsense! (To Kramer) I have Benes' woderfully imaginative mind to spin my stories. You take back your tales, you vagabond!
So did you have any trouble finding the place?
Ha ha, nonsense, George. Besides it gives me a chance to tell you about my latest trip to Burma where I discovered a very unusual corduroy.
(Turns on the T.V, and starts flipping through the channels) Oh damn. They changed the cable stations again.. just when I finally memorized them.
Elaine! Where's Susie? I want her to head up our new Fingerless Glove Division.
I saw a woman in our hallway wearing one of these as a top. (sits on the corner of the desk)What exquisite beauty, I ran down the hallway to talk to her, but the elevator door closed. It was not to be.Perhaps our paths will cross again some day.
Jaba! Bagama ma Jaba. Olymala Hungui. (The boy runs out of the room)
It's jammed! I'll slide it under the door,
Apparently Peggy--down in Design?--got into a liiiittle bit of a Tiff yesterday with somebody named, "Susie"?
well, I'm sure we'll come up with something. What do you say you and I order ourselves a pie? Do you like Lorenzo's?
Ha ha ha ha...Oh, what a stirring little anthem of wellness.
That's the best way to get someplace you've never been.
(emotional) And I thought I knew what love was.
Elaine, do you have a moment? It's about your lover.
You want to know something? I no longer need them!
Elaine, I'm afraid I have incurred yet another flat tire.
We're gonna sell this as a top. Here's the angle Zelda Fitzgerald, aaaand, somebody in the 20s, wearing this at wild parties, driving all the men crazy (tosses the bra on Elaines desk) Have it on my desk by the end of the week.
Inside that small college boy minifridge is my latest acquisition. A slice of cake from the wedding of King Edward VIII to Wallis Simpson, circa 1937, price--$29,000.
Elaine, I have a question for you. Is the item still...with you?
Elaine, you're out of control. You need help.
Elaine, do you see this? Do you see what I'm holding in my hands?
So, we pay off your friend, and it becomes a Peterman.
Don't you drag me into this! This is between you and her, and her. (indicating empty chair)
Morty. My stories are what sell these clothes.
Unfortunately, I am also disgusted. This is incoherent drivel! This is a total redo. And I'm assuming I need it right away.
...And there, tucked into the river's bend was the object of my search. The Gwon-Jaya River market, fabrics and spices traded under a starlit sky. It was there that I discovered the Pamplona beret. Sizes seven-and-a-half through eight-and-three-quarters. Price? Thirty-five dollars.
Oh, Elaine. George, when momma said 'Bosco' she must have been trying to communicate something, a legacy, a dying wish perhaps.
Then in the distance I heard the bulls. I began running as fast as I could. Fortunately I was wearing my Italian Captoe Oxfords. Sophisticated yet different; nothing to make a huge fuss about. Rich dark brown calfskin leather. Matching leather vent. Men's whole and half sizes 7 through 13. Price $135.00.
Do you know what happens to a butter-based frosting after six decades in a poorly ventilated English basement?
I just spoke with her, Elaine. She's in bed.
(Looking at his dying plant) Ohh, damn. I forgot to buy plant food again.. I'll bet I got a coupon for it. (Starts looking through a small coupon box)
Well, it started out nicely "I'm returning some pants." A very identifiable problem.. (turns page) "I set of down a train tunnel.".. (turns page) But that's where the story takes a most unappealing turn.
I'm afraid I have some bad news, Elaine. It appears you will not be accompanying me to Africa.
(busting in) Not on my watch! (Grabs Kramer by the collar) I won't have you turning my office into a den of iniquity! Get your fix somewhere else!
That infernal rattling sound that has plagued me these past two days - and I could not find the source. In my office, in the hallway. Even in the men's room! Shame on you, Elaine!
You know George, growing up as a boy in Costa Rica, I heard a rumor that momma had taken a lover. Perhaps Bosco was this man's name.
Oh, and one more thing. You may have osteoporosis.
That reminds me of the Hatian Voodoo rattle torture! You haven't gone over to their side have you?
Elaine, who among us hasn't snuck into the break room to nibble on a love newton?
Another productive meeting. By the way, I saw that English Patient film last night. It was extraordinary.
Oh no, that doesnt matter now. That's a very nice jacket.
Oh, Elaine, we've covered all of that in the catalogue ad nauseum. No, I would like this book to be about my day-to-day life.
That's right, Elaine. White lotus. Yam-yam. Shanghai Sally.
Twenty thousand dollars!?! Elaine, that's twice the amount I authorised you to spend.
(Intrigued) The very pants I was returning. That's perfect irony! Elaine, that is interesting writing! (The intercom beeps)
(smiles and laughs) Ha ha ha. Funny you should ask, Elaine.
(returns) Flash of lightning Elaine I just realized why I like this cartoon so much.
Because, if I hear one more rattle - just one - your out on your can. And if you are undead - I'll find out about that too. (Exits)
Now, down to business. (thoughtful) I have had this vision of a diaphanous rum-runner scarf.
...and I, of course, will return to mine. Kudos, Elaine, on a job... done.
(Hangs up) There you are, Elaine. Go forth, and create. (Elaine gets up to leave) And, by the way, when you get to that chapter about my romantic escapades - feel free to toss yourself in the mix.
Very soft, huge button flaps, cargo pockets, draw string waist, deep biswing vents in the back perfect for jumping into a gondola.
And, in a tiny way, I almost feel responsible. I'm the one who sent him to Thailand - in search of low-cost whistles. Filled his head with pseudoerotic tales of my own Opium excursions. Plus, I have him some phone numbers of places he could score near the hotel.
Just Hold On a minute. Still One Short.
(to Bob) I want you to handle all the fact-checking and the copy-editing for the new catalogue.
So, anyway, effective immediately, Miss Benes will return to her old position, at her original salary...
(upbeat) Oh, Elaine, this dry air is curing me like a Black Forest ham.
Elaine, according to your urine analysis, you're menopausal. you have the metabolism of a sixty-eight year old woman.
(Laughs) Kramer, my friend, that is one ripping good yarn.. (Hands Kramer a check)
The fire will eat up this entire block!
(looks at his watch) It's only five fifteen. So, later on that same day, I developed a great hankering for some wild honey...
Momma. Just talk to her, George. The doctor seems to think it helps.
I know what you're going through. I too once fell under the spell of opium. It was 1979. I was travelling the Yangtzee in search of a Mongolian horsehair vest. I had got to the market after sundown, all of the clothing traders had gone, but a different sort of trader still lurked about. "Just a taste," he said. That was all it took.
I'm afraid the problem with Zach is more serious. He's back on the horse, Elaine. Smack. White palace. The Chinaman's nightcap.
