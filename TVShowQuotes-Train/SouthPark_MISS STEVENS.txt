Good! You deserve to die, you little bastard!  Eric, we have to stay together!
Okay. Just what the heck is going on here, people?  AAAAA!!
What exactly are you guys doing out here, with all this ...construction equipment?
Children, it's the Yanogapa.  Do not be afraid. We are not here to tear down your rainforest. 
Oh God, this is a nightmare! We're never going to make the festival!
Uh, yah, soooo, do you have a phone we could use?
No. The Spirit of Maya has told me to go this way.
Nooo, I hate the rainforest! You go right ahead and plow down this whole fucking thing!
All right, that does it!!  Goddamn stupid-ass rainforest!! This place fucking sucks!!  I was wrong!! Fuck the rainforest!! I fucking hate it, I fucking hate it!!
Well, we hope that our gift of song has warmed your hearts.
Boys, please. Not every Spanish person eats tacos and burritos. That's a stereotype.  Children, he wants us to follow him! Oooh, thank goodness! I think this ordeal is over! 
Oh, thank goodness! Hello, sir. We are lost.  Cah heh, can you help us?
Oh nonono, Jake. That fragile flower is very delicate, okay? 
Oh, wonderful! We were lost, and it is such a great coincidence we found you. You see, we're here to protest the government-sanctioned raping of your rainforest.  We are fighters, just like you. Could you help us get back to San Jos√©?  Um...  Oh, I know! Perhaps you would like a gift.. Well, we have o-honly-hee one gift to give. The gift... of song 
Oh, boy oh!! Oh my God, get it off me!! For the love of God, get it off me!! Oh my God!!  Oh-okay, children. We must understand that the insects of the rainforest help the delicate balance of life here.  Oh my God!! 
Now kids, let's be a bit more "open-minded." I read all about this in Newsweek; this is a "people's army." They are fighting the fascist policies of their fascist government.  Oh, hello. Do you speak of English?
Look how they live in peace with all living things. Gentle, noble...  Run for your lives, children!
Shh. Children, okay, let's try to listen to what the rainforest tells us. And if we use our ears she can tell us so many things. Perhaps-
Oh, there's just no end to this place! I think maybe we're going in circles. Oh, dear God! The summit starts in an hour; I'm gonna lose my job!  Aaaah!
Kyle, for the love of God, do the right choreography.  Oh, Kyle, please!
