Oh nonono, Jake. That fragile flower is very delicate, okay? 
Now kids, let's be a bit more "open-minded." I read all about this in Newsweek; this is a "people's army." They are fighting the fascist policies of their fascist government.  Oh, hello. Do you speak of English?
Kyle, for the love of God, do the right choreography.  Oh, Kyle, please! 
Oh, boy oh!! Oh my God, get it off me!! For the love of God, get it off me!! Oh my God!!  Oh-okay, children. We must understand that the insects of the rainforest help the delicate balance of life here.  Oh my God!! 
Young man, I am the adult here, and I say you go this way!
No. The Spirit of Maya has told me to go this way.
What exactly are you guys doing out here, with all this ...construction equipment?
Oh, there's just no end to this place! I think maybe we're going in circles. Oh, dear God! The summit starts in an hour; I'm gonna lose my job!  Aaaah!
Okay. Just what the heck is going on here, people?  AAAAA!!
Oh God, this is a nightmare! We're never going to make the festival!
Uh, yah, soooo, do you have a phone we could use?
Oh, thank goodness! Hello, sir. We are lost.  Cah heh, can you help us?
Shh. Children, okay, let's try to listen to what the rainforest tells us. And if we use our ears she can tell us so many things. Perhaps-
All right, that does it!!  Goddamn stupid-ass rainforest!! This place fucking sucks!!  I was wrong!! Fuck the rainforest!! I fucking hate it, I fucking hate it!!
Children, it's the Yanogapa.  Do not be afraid. We are not here to tear down your rainforest. 
Nooo, I hate the rainforest! You go right ahead and plow down this whole fucking thing!
Look how they live in peace with all living things. Gentle, noble...  Run for your lives, children!
Boys, please. Not every Spanish person eats tacos and burritos. That's a stereotype.  Children, he wants us to follow him! Oooh, thank goodness! I think this ordeal is over! 
Oh, wonderful! We were lost, and it is such a great coincidence we found you. You see, we're here to protest the government-sanctioned raping of your rainforest.  We are fighters, just like you. Could you help us get back to San Jos√©?  Um...  Oh, I know! Perhaps you would like a gift.. Well, we have o-honly-hee one gift to give. The gift... of song 
Is it because of the little Jewish boy's choreography?
