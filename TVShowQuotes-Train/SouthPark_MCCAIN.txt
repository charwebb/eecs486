Meet... the Presidential Escape Tunnel,  A two-mile long underground passage that runs from the White House to a location outside the city limits in case of an attack. The tunnel is only accessible from the Oval Office and just happens to travel right underneath the Smithsonian Natural History Museum.
And we run on a particularly brutal campaign so that the nation is as distracted as possible over the next... eight hours.
I almost thought we were gonna tie for a minute there. That would have screwed us.
Nicely done, B. We're in position outside the Smithsonian.  You find the escape tunnel?
Michelle, we need you to do a different scan hack through the vault relay.
It's McCain, we did it! Obama is President.
You get somebody into that tunnel, they can blast into the museum, let the others in, the heist is on.
Yes, we do. Assemble the rest of the team: we've only got ten hours.
Guys, we've all known each other a long time, had many incredible adventures, but this is going to be our greatest feat ever.
My friends, while the entire country is busy reacting to the election, we are about to pull off the greatest heist in human history.
