Um, order me a piece of cake. I'm gonna go throw up.
What does he look like?
He's not working?! How come he's not working?
Why did he get fired?
Best seat in the house. (Looking at George) right next to the kitchen.
No, you can be young and bitter, just maybe not as bitter as I'm gonna be ten years from now, but I'm bitter. Anyway, don't tell anyone.
He was uncomfortable because it was our first time so he felt he would perform better if we did it in the kitchen. He said the kitchen is always the most sociable room in the house. And he was serious.
What does he look like?
Yeah. How'd you know?
I am very worried, I am never late.
I mean the problem is that the good ones know they're good. And they know they're in such demand they're just not interested in confining themselves to one person.
He didn't really try to poison his boss?
Excuse me?
Great, my boyfriend's just parking the car. Actually, Jerry, you
First of all, what does he do?
Has he ever been married?
What?
Has he been close?
I missed my period.
(bored, frustrated) Russell, can we eat?
Fat. Is that what you're saying, that he's fat?
Who says I'm not bitter?
Is Jerry one of the good ones?
There's just no men out there, you know?
Well, the mediocre ones are available, but they're so insecure about not being one of the good ones that they're always going, "Well I'm not good enough for you, what are you doing with me?" and eventually I just go, "You're right."
Hi Jerry, nice to finally meet you.
How good could it be? My head was on a hot plate.
No, maybe I need somebody who has nothing, somebody who just has to appreciate being with me because he's so desperate.
He's bald?
(bored) Russell, where's the TV Guide.
So he shows up. He's all out of breath. He's disheveled. And he tells me that no matter what happens, whatever I decide is fine with him and that I could depend on him, and that he would be there to support me in whatever way I need. Elaine, I was speechless.
So he will be bald.
Hello, Abby.
Oh wait, don't you tell him any of this.
I know, but these things aren't always foolproof.
Hi.
