No, maybe I need somebody who has nothing, somebody who just has to appreciate being with me because he's so desperate.
Um, order me a piece of cake. I'm gonna go throw up.
He was uncomfortable because it was our first time so he felt he would perform better if we did it in the kitchen. He said the kitchen is always the most sociable room in the house. And he was serious.
Best seat in the house. (Looking at George) right next to the kitchen.
Fat. Is that what you're saying, that he's fat?
There's just no men out there, you know?
Excuse me?
Yeah. How'd you know?
How good could it be? My head was on a hot plate.
Kenny Bania.
(bored, frustrated) Russell, can we eat?
I am very worried, I am never late.
What does he look like?
So he will be bald.
Is he nuts?
So he shows up. He's all out of breath. He's disheveled. And he tells me that no matter what happens, whatever I decide is fine with him and that I could depend on him, and that he would be there to support me in whatever way I need. Elaine, I was speechless.
Hi.
What?
Hello, Abby.
(bored) Russell, where's the TV Guide.
Who says I'm not bitter?
Great, my boyfriend's just parking the car. Actually, Jerry, you
Has he ever been married?
No, you can be young and bitter, just maybe not as bitter as I'm gonna be ten years from now, but I'm bitter. Anyway, don't tell anyone.
He's not working?! How come he's not working?
Why did he get fired?
Is Jerry one of the good ones?
Has he been close?
He's bald?
I missed my period.
First of all, what does he do?
Oh wait, don't you tell him any of this.
What does he look like?
Hi Jerry, nice to finally meet you.
I know, but these things aren't always foolproof.
See, I wouldn't really mind so much, but I feel badly for my mother. I mean, if my mother weren't around, it wouldn't be so bad. But, I'm telling you, if I'm not married by the time I'm forty, I'm gonna have to kill her because it's the only fair thing to do. I just couldn't put her through that.
