No, you can be young and bitter, just maybe not as bitter as I'm gonna be ten years from now, but I'm bitter. Anyway, don't tell anyone.
Well, the mediocre ones are available, but they're so insecure about not being one of the good ones that they're always going, "Well I'm not good enough for you, what are you doing with me?" and eventually I just go, "You're right."
Hi.
(bored, frustrated) Russell, can we eat?
Hello, Abby.
Fat. Is that what you're saying, that he's fat?
What does he look like?
There's just no men out there, you know?
What does he look like?
Yeah. How'd you know?
Who says I'm not bitter?
Hi Jerry, nice to finally meet you.
First of all, what does he do?
I mean the problem is that the good ones know they're good. And they know they're in such demand they're just not interested in confining themselves to one person.
How good could it be? My head was on a hot plate.
Oh wait, don't you tell him any of this.
He was uncomfortable because it was our first time so he felt he would perform better if we did it in the kitchen. He said the kitchen is always the most sociable room in the house. And he was serious.
What?
Is Jerry one of the good ones?
He's not working?! How come he's not working?
Why did he get fired?
Great, my boyfriend's just parking the car. Actually, Jerry, you
I know, but these things aren't always foolproof.
Has he been close?
He didn't really try to poison his boss?
I said to him, "I really appreciate this, but I just got my period." And so, I asked him to come in, he came in--
See, I wouldn't really mind so much, but I feel badly for my mother. I mean, if my mother weren't around, it wouldn't be so bad. But, I'm telling you, if I'm not married by the time I'm forty, I'm gonna have to kill her because it's the only fair thing to do. I just couldn't put her through that.
I missed my period.
Best seat in the house. (Looking at George) right next to the kitchen.
He's bald?
(bored) Russell, where's the TV Guide.
Excuse me?
No, maybe I need somebody who has nothing, somebody who just has to appreciate being with me because he's so desperate.
I am very worried, I am never late.
Um, order me a piece of cake. I'm gonna go throw up.
Has he ever been married?
