Hey, Elaine. I'll be off in a second.
I'm glad you're here. This can get really boring. Do you know where I can get some good olives?
By the way, you look really great in that leotard.
Oh, I see...you're friends with the urinator, aren't you?
Yeah. He's disgusting! Besides, I'll take any chance I can to talk to her.
Hey, you know what's weird? I think I had a dream about you last night.
Can I have a sip of your water?
I caught him urinating in the shower. I'm thinking about turning him in, too.
Thanks. (Is about to take a drink, but wipes the neck of the bottle with his shirt first.)
Oh, well, It's all yours. (Walks away. Elaine looks at the machine, then George runs over.)
Yeah. (Spies the shapely manager of the health club.) Oh, there's the manager. Good. I think I'm gonna talk to her about that guy, you know, we cannot have people like that in here.
