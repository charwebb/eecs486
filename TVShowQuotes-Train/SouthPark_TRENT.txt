Tell them it was an accident: you thought you could put it out.
You had five years to do that. And while I wasted away my time in prison you've been enjoying nice, normal lives!
I've been lookin' for you!  Five years I've been waitin' for this day.
Look, just take your punishment! You deserve it! Let me have my retribution and it can be over with.
Can you give me back my time?! Huh?! Can you do that?! Kindergarten, first grade, second?! Can you give me that?!
Don't tell me that! I heard about the things you've done! But there were no magical Christmas adventures or talking poo for me! I DIDN'T GET TO FIGHT A HUGE MECHANIC BARBERA STALKER!! NO ACCIDENTAL TRIPS TO AFGANASTAN FOR TRENT BOYETT!! 
You'd better pray I never get out of Juvenile Hall! You'd better all pray! 
I gots some business to take care of. 
I'm gonna give you something you didn't give me: a five-second head-start.
Five years. It's been five long, miserable years.
You don't even know how to use that!  Wow!
