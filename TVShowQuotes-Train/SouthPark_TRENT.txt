Can you give me back my time?! Huh?! Can you do that?! Kindergarten, first grade, second?! Can you give me that?!
I gots some business to take care of. 
I've been lookin' for you!  Five years I've been waitin' for this day.
You'd better pray I never get out of Juvenile Hall! You'd better all pray! 
You don't even know how to use that!  Wow! 
You had five years to do that. And while I wasted away my time in prison you've been enjoying nice, normal lives!
Don't tell me that! I heard about the things you've done! But there were no magical Christmas adventures or talking poo for me! I DIDN'T GET TO FIGHT A HUGE MECHANIC BARBERA STALKER!! NO ACCIDENTAL TRIPS TO AFGANASTAN FOR TRENT BOYETT!! 
I'm gonna give you something you didn't give me: a five-second head-start.
Do you fuckheads even know how to put out a fire?
Look, just take your punishment! You deserve it! Let me have my retribution and it can be over with.
Five years. It's been five long, miserable years.
