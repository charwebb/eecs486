Sorry Garrison, your penis is gone. Afraid there's nothing more we can do. You'll just have to live with being a woman. A very ugly one. Come on, men. 
Nono, none of us watched the video, but if we did, we could handle it. We're police officers. We see sickening things like that every day.
Alright, listen: you have five seconds to leave or we're gonna put you in the jail and call your parents!
Muhammad showed up and there was no violence at all?
That's right. Of all his multiple personalities, the strongest was Lu Kim. And we never would have known... if it hadn'ta been for Inspector Butters. 
Well I'm sorry but you're under arrest. Take the kid to jail. 
You boys say you can identify the Red Box thieves?
Mr. Mackey? Mr. Mackey!  We're putting a stop to this play! It's over.
Apparently not. These are dangerous guys. Do you have any idea where they were headed?
Sounds like you're talking about the Red Box killers. They've murdered over a dozen people trying to get the cash from Red Boxes.
Yeah, showing an image of him is completely off limits and censored, so nobody has seen what Muhammad looks like. 
All right then. We're gonna have to send one of you into the party in disguise.
We'll send a bill for the damages,  but in the meantime, please keep a closer eye on your child, sir? 
And the last time you saw your penis was two days ago? 
Mr. Yelman, we received some disturbing reports that you might be hoarding sheep.
Yes, I'm sure he could. But, then again,  does the world really need another therapist?
Mayor, we do not have the resources to deal with this situation! A full evacuation is impossible!
You are a beacon of hope in an otherwise bleak and dreary world! 
Go ahead. We're gonna process him and get him back to the restaurant. 
Obviously the terrorists are for real!  What does that paper say?  We have placed bombs all over your city. You will give Muhammad to us. The celebrities want Muhammad for his power not to be ridiculed. We want that power... huzzah.
Dammit Marsh, why couldn't you have just kept your stupid ugly son in line!
You'd better give me every cop you've got on the South Side! I don't care where ABC parks their truck, as long as it doesn't block the fire trucks!  Jesus, this protest is getting out of hand! Alright, what exactly are we dealing with?
You can let it go, Mackey. Tooth Decay is gone.
Jesus Christ,  can we get a lock on that window?  Look kid, you need to stop- 
It's here! The class warfare is finally here!
There's been an Asian turf war, sir, and your son appears to have caused it.
Oh, Mysterion, thank God you've come. What news do you have?
Idiot, if he isn't seen, we're about to definitely get bombed.
Well I suppose there's no need for jail, Mr. and Mrs. Stotch, so long as you ground your son.
All right, all right. We'll do everything we can.
No. it's over! They got him, Mr. Mackey. Tooth Decay. They got the sonofabitch.
Don't do it, Mysterion! If you show your identity we'll be forced to arrest you for being a vigilante
Damnit! Don't these protesters know what this is all heading towards?  Full-on class warfare.
Well I mean, would it really be so bad for us to just let him go on thinking he's Lu Kim forever? Now that City Sushi is gone, City Wok is the only Chinese restaurant left in town.
Well, at least everything is accounted for. Thank God you came when you did, Dr. Janus.
What?! Are you crazy?! We can't cancel the Monster Mash, it's Halloween Night! It's the Monster Mash's biggest night of the year!
Well, I hope you guys have learned that crime doesn't pay.
