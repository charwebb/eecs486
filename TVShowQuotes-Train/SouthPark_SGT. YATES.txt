Mr. Yelman, we received some disturbing reports that you might be hoarding sheep.

Now listen! There's nothing more we can do to protect your homes. But there's someone here who says he can. 

You won't believe it...

He's not Chinese! He's white!

Alright, we'll put a sheet over him.

What is it?

Bon Jovi?

Alright, listen: you have five seconds to leave or we're gonna put you in the jail and call your parents!

All right, all right. We'll do everything we can.

What?! Are you crazy?! We can't cancel the Monster Mash, it's Halloween Night! It's the Monster Mash's biggest night of the year!

We got the sonofabitch!

Go ahead. We're gonna process him and get him back to the restaurant. 

Obviously the terrorists are for real!  What does that paper say?  We have placed bombs all over your city. You will give Muhammad to us. The celebrities want Muhammad for his power not to be ridiculed. We want that power... huzzah.

Don't do it, Mysterion! If you show your identity we'll be forced to arrest you for being a vigilante

Well I suppose there's no need for jail, Mr. and Mrs. Stotch, so long as you ground your son.

And the last time you saw your penis was two days ago? 

Muhammad showed up and there was no violence at all?

You can let it go, Mackey. Tooth Decay is gone.

How are we gonna contain this ting?!

Damnit! Don't these protesters know what this is all heading towards?  Full-on class warfare.

Alright, things are pretty quiet out there, boys. Let's try to get caught up on some paperwork. Murphy I want you to- 

Yeah, showing an image of him is completely off limits and censored, so nobody has seen what Muhammad looks like. 

Oh, Mysterion, thank God you've come. What news do you have?

Well I mean, would it really be so bad for us to just let him go on thinking he's Lu Kim forever? Now that City Sushi is gone, City Wok is the only Chinese restaurant left in town.

Sorry Garrison, your penis is gone. Afraid there's nothing more we can do. You'll just have to live with being a woman. A very ugly one. Come on, men. 

Idiot, if he isn't seen, we're about to definitely get bombed.

Your name is Dr. Janus!

Well, I hope you guys have learned that crime doesn't pay.

FIRE! 

What?

Oh, not this kid again.

There's been an Asian turf war, sir, and your son appears to have caused it.

Apparently not. These are dangerous guys. Do you have any idea where they were headed?

All right, stop it!

What's in here? 

Just get out of here before we-! 

So you say this man killed himself because he was a psychopath who was forced to have sex with his mother? 

It's here! The class warfare is finally here!

Sounds like you're talking about the Red Box killers. They've murdered over a dozen people trying to get the cash from Red Boxes.

Yes, I'm sure he could. But, then again,  does the world really need another therapist?

You are a beacon of hope in an otherwise bleak and dreary world! 

No. it's over! They got him, Mr. Mackey. Tooth Decay. They got the sonofabitch.

Nono, none of us watched the video, but if we did, we could handle it. We're police officers. We see sickening things like that every day.

Done!

All right, quiet down people, please! Quiet!  I know you're all worried about your families' security. All I can tell you is that so far, Bane has not been caught. 

We'll send a bill for the damages,  but in the meantime, please keep a closer eye on your child, sir? 

You think your bullets can hurt him? 

And where are the actual protesters?

You boys say you can identify the Red Box thieves?

Jesus Christ,  can we get a lock on that window?  Look kid, you need to stop- 

Whatever. Then we'll just put you in- 

That's right. Of all his multiple personalities, the strongest was Lu Kim. And we never would have known... if it hadn'ta been for Inspector Butters. 

How many people at the Monster Mash?

This is South Park Police!

Well, at least everything is accounted for. Thank God you came when you did, Dr. Janus.

Well I'm sorry but you're under arrest. Take the kid to jail. 

Mr. Mackey? Mr. Mackey!  We're putting a stop to this play! It's over.
