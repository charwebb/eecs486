Ms. Garrision, I believe that's a gross over-simplification.

I've never met a woman with so much... fire

Ms. Garrison. Ms. Garrison, could I have a word with you, please?

Well what if I told you there was a flying spaghetti monster: Would you believe it simply because it can't be disproven?

I never covered it up.

Uuuuugh! You're a man?!

Can you imagine a world with no religion? No Muslims killing Jews, no Christians bombing abortion clinics. The world would be a wonderful place... without God.

Look, I know you think we're at war, but I want you to know I admire your passion.

Oh, Ms. Garrison, you are the most outspoken woman I have ever met! It's almost like you're one of the guys.

Actually, no. Because I'm an atheist.

Careful darling. The school board doesn't like it when we-

Really?? Oh that's wonderful!

Would you then... consider having dinner with me tonight?

Oh Ms. Garrison!

You have so much spunk, so much life... If only you were an atheist.

Oh yeah, baby! Oh-hm. 

Why is someone as outspoken as you given themselves over to the whole God thing?

Explain?? How can I be so stupid?? 

I'm sorry, but Mr. Garrison has passed away. Mrs. Garrison is the only person here and she's rather tied up at the moment.

Oh, just let me see those beautiful breasts again.

So much boldness in a woman. So beautiful.  I'm sorry, I'm sure you have a husband, but I-

You see, children, life has the amazing ability to change, to adapt. Like changing us to the point that we walk upright.

Ms. Garrison, I'm not so sure what you did in class today was right.

An emergency?

I'll thell them... to call you back... Oh... yeah...  Garrison residence. Can you call... back later, please?

You must understand, children, that we are dealing with VERY large numbers here.

Yes, but to be so bold about it...  I've just never seen a woman with such... balls.

You're so welcome!

AAAH!

Oh Ms. Garrison!

Well yes, basically, we are.

Over billions of years life has evolved from simple one-celled organisms into all the complex life we see around us. 

Charmed to meet you. Ms...

It was changes in hereditary traits that allowed the first mammals to breath in the air.

Ms. Garrison, this isn't theory, it is scientific fact!

What on earth are you doing??
