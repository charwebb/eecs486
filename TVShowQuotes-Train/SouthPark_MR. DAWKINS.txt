Ms. Garrison, this isn't theory, it is scientific fact!
I've never met a woman with so much... fire
Would you then... consider having dinner with me tonight?
Why is someone as outspoken as you given themselves over to the whole God thing?
Oh, just let me see those beautiful breasts again.
Oh, Ms. Garrison, you are the most outspoken woman I have ever met! It's almost like you're one of the guys.
Yes, but to be so bold about it...  I've just never seen a woman with such... balls.
So, evolution doesn't even happen by chance. It is, in fact, bound to happen.
It was changes in hereditary traits that allowed the first mammals to breath in the air.
Can you imagine a world with no religion? No Muslims killing Jews, no Christians bombing abortion clinics. The world would be a wonderful place... without God.
You have so much spunk, so much life... If only you were an atheist.
Ms. Garrision, I believe that's a gross over-simplification.
Look, I know you think we're at war, but I want you to know I admire your passion.
Well what if I told you there was a flying spaghetti monster: Would you believe it simply because it can't be disproven?
Ms. Garrison, I'm not so sure what you did in class today was right.
Over billions of years life has evolved from simple one-celled organisms into all the complex life we see around us. 
Ms. Garrison. Ms. Garrison, could I have a word with you, please?
You see, children, life has the amazing ability to change, to adapt. Like changing us to the point that we walk upright.
I'll thell them... to call you back... Oh... yeah...  Garrison residence. Can you call... back later, please?
I'm sorry, but Mr. Garrison has passed away. Mrs. Garrison is the only person here and she's rather tied up at the moment.
So much boldness in a woman. So beautiful.  I'm sorry, I'm sure you have a husband, but I-
You must understand, children, that we are dealing with VERY large numbers here.
