You have so much spunk, so much life... If only you were an atheist.

Ms. Garrison. Ms. Garrison, could I have a word with you, please?

Really?? Oh that's wonderful!

Well what if I told you there was a flying spaghetti monster: Would you believe it simply because it can't be disproven?

An emergency?

Ms. Garrison, this isn't theory, it is scientific fact!

So much boldness in a woman. So beautiful.  I'm sorry, I'm sure you have a husband, but I-

Oh Ms. Garrison!

AAAH!

Yes, but to be so bold about it...  I've just never seen a woman with such... balls.

Charmed to meet you. Ms...

Over billions of years life has evolved from simple one-celled organisms into all the complex life we see around us. 

You see, children, life has the amazing ability to change, to adapt. Like changing us to the point that we walk upright.

Explain?? How can I be so stupid?? 

Oh Ms. Garrison!

Actually, no. Because I'm an atheist.

Well yes, basically, we are.

Oh, Ms. Garrison, you are the most outspoken woman I have ever met! It's almost like you're one of the guys.

Principal Victoria, I really don't think that's necessary. This woman is very opinionated but, she does care about her students.

Uuuuugh! You're a man?!

It was changes in hereditary traits that allowed the first mammals to breath in the air.

Ms. Garrision, I believe that's a gross over-simplification.

Sex-change operation??

Look, I know you think we're at war, but I want you to know I admire your passion.

Oh, just let me see those beautiful breasts again.

I've never met a woman with so much... fire

Careful darling. The school board doesn't like it when we-

Would you then... consider having dinner with me tonight?

I'll thell them... to call you back... Oh... yeah...  Garrison residence. Can you call... back later, please?

You're so welcome!

So, evolution doesn't even happen by chance. It is, in fact, bound to happen.

Ms. Garrison, I'm not so sure what you did in class today was right.

You must understand, children, that we are dealing with VERY large numbers here.

Can you imagine a world with no religion? No Muslims killing Jews, no Christians bombing abortion clinics. The world would be a wonderful place... without God.

I'm sorry, but Mr. Garrison has passed away. Mrs. Garrison is the only person here and she's rather tied up at the moment.

I never covered it up.
