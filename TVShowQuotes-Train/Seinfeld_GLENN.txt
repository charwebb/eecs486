It's nothing special, just a little place I keep.
Um, uh, no one, no one. (running with Elaine into an alley) Here, uh, let me show you a short cut. Come on. Come on.
(coming back through the window carrying an old chair) I think this will burn!
No, no, no, no. When they make the new ones, the old ones come out... right here.
(still looking through the garbage bag) It's a bear claw! You have no idea how rare this is.
(seeing a woman on the street) Oh, no.
I'm having a little problem with the heat. Um, I got some cardboard out here. (climbing through the window)
So, um, why don't we get together some time?
So you would choose your last meal based on the method of execution?
(re the bear claw) You know, Elaine, you're the bear claw in the garbage bag of my life. (breaks bear claw in half and offers her a piece)
