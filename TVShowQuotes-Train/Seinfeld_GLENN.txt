So you would choose your last meal based on the method of execution?
(still looking through the garbage bag) It's a bear claw! You have no idea how rare this is.
(seeing a woman on the street) Oh, no.
I'm having a little problem with the heat. Um, I got some cardboard out here. (climbing through the window)
I think it'd be better if I called you.
(re the bear claw) You know, Elaine, you're the bear claw in the garbage bag of my life. (breaks bear claw in half and offers her a piece)
It's nothing special, just a little place I keep.
Um, uh, no one, no one. (running with Elaine into an alley) Here, uh, let me show you a short cut. Come on. Come on.
So, um, why don't we get together some time?
No, no, no, no. When they make the new ones, the old ones come out... right here.
