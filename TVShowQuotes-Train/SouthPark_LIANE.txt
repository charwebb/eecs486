Oh wait, wait.  You've got a little eye booger, hon.

No, honey, Mommy's gotta save her throat. I have to work tonight.

Ooh, sweetums, did you laugh too hard again?

Oh. Ah, I'm white trash and I'm in trouble.

No, sweetie, I've been at the hair salon. Why?

Okay, muffin. Mommy's leaving now. You do what the babysitter tells you, okay?

If you're really sorry, then you'll understand why you aren't getting anything!

This year is gonna be different. Look!  I got you "Hooked On Monkey Fonics." 

Cartman. Yesuh- it's such a hard decision, but I just don't feel I can raise a child in this screwy world.

I guess it's much better to get it when you're young.

Oh, you've finally come back! It's a miracle!

Oooh, I'm gonna decorate the house for Halloween,
with scary ghosts and bats and creepy crawly things...
Hello there!

Eric, I'm working two jobs. Mommy's doing everything she can.

Eric, stop acting like a spoiled brat! You can either have the Toshiba Handibook or you can have nothing at all!

Oh, there there, sweetie. It'll be okay. These things happen.

Nnno, I got you something that's going to help you win the big spelling bee tomorrow.

No, you don't have to fly to Russia, hon.

I'm making you some lunch right now, Eric.

Oh, he will. My little poopsiekins is a very good little boy.

Oh dear... I was checking out the Internet and ih, it almost seems like his symptoms are like those in something called "Tour, Tourette's Syndrome"?

Well, I think you need to keep your laws off of my body.

Well, Eric, there's nothing more I can do about it.

Eric, the day I met your father it was like - magic! It was a beautiful autumn night when the aspen trees were turning, at the Twelfth Annual Drunken Barn Dance. 

Here we go, kids. We're crossing the state line into Nebraska. 

Oh, but I suppose it would be good for him. Yes, of course he can go. I'll bring some of clothes over.

Oh, what a party that was!  Hmm-hm-hm-hmm. Hmm-hm-hm-hmm. 

Oh, Eric, it's just part of being a child.

Uh sweetie, I see that you're a little... disturbed right now, but, maybe you can-

She talked with her son and says he doesn't have it.

Eric, I want you to go upstairs and brush your teeth. Then I'll be up to read you a story before bed.  Oh my goodness. I can't believe it.

I love you very much, poopsiekins. You're Mommy's sunshine. 

Oh, Chief. I want your hot man chowder.

Well, what if I took you to Kentucky Fried Chicken afterward?  And then we'll go to Target and buy you a Mega Ranger.

Here, Kyle. Will you hold Great-Grandma's catheter bag during dinner? 

Now you be careful, Eric. The woods can be very dangerous.

I just, I- I'm gonna go make you kids some lemonade. 

You're the best, Cesar, and to show my gratitude I've got two tickets for you and me to see Madame Butterfly this Friday night.

Eric, did you say 'hi' to your little cousin Elvin?

Here hon, I packed you some cheesy poofs and happy tarts.

There you are, Eric! Come on, we have to go to the eye doctor.

Sweetie, you really can just talk to me if you-

Oohh, you look great, hon. Mommy's fat little piggy.

Oh, I've told him to respect people's property. What did he take?

You have been bad, so you're gonna have to drink from this glass. 

The best part is I'm not letting him boss me around anymore. I could have never come out and have a nice lunch on a Saturday afternoon with a friend before.

Hello, everybody.  Now, just do it like we rehearsed, hon.

Excuse me, shouldn't we wait for everyone to arrive before we get started?

Oh Cesar, I'm so happy to have you in my life. 

Eric dear? I just got a call from your friend Kyle's mother. She said that this show is naughty, and might make you a potty mouth.

Oh. Well, I'll tell Eric. He's just down in the basement playing with his dolls. 

Wheat. The building block of your favorite foods, and, Nebraska's principal source of economic productivity. You see, when Nebraska first became--

I made some healthy tofu pudding to celebrate. Who wants some?

Eric, sweetie, there's a bunch of people showing up in our backyard saying something about a meeting?

Come on. Do you want your laser corrective surgery or not?

Eric, please. We have to do some studying today.

It's the most wonderful time of the year
do do do do do do do do-

Oh, he's been amazing, Cesar. He got an A on his last spelling test and a B+ in history. He's losing weight and he's doing what I tell him.

Oh... But I thought we were becoming friends.

Eric, you're just going to have to be patient. 

That shouldn't be a problem. Eric's Grandma is right near the mall.

Oh, a- a- all right, sweetie, I- I'll take you tomorrow.

Eric, if you don't want to eat then, why don't you go brush your teeth and go to bed?!

I think we need to get you a different brand, hon. They're a little cheaper.

Sweetie, there's a Mr. Pun Li Tsiao on the phone for you?

I asked little Eric where he would feel safest, and he said with his friend Token.

These are Eric's friends: Stan, Kyle, and Kenny. Boys, let me introduce you to the Cartman family. This is Uncle Stinky.

No no no, that's impossible, hon. I told her: no visitors.

Yes they are, but you were supposed to be grounded in your room! And now you're more grounded, young man!

I'm sorry I never told you, Eric.  I just thought, maybe it would be a little shocking to you.

Then why did you go outside to a police officer and say "Help! Help! My mommy is trying to fuck me!"?

Oooh, what should I do? I'm playing roulette with my child's life!  Ooo wait, Hairspray is showing in New York, isn't it? Let's go there.

Oohh, honey, why don't you make it yourself?  Mommy's  expecting  some company.

Great-grandma has a bladder problem. This helps her out.

Well, Sheila, we can't shelter our boys forever from these things. Maybe it's okay for them to see an adult film.

Oh my! She must think that you are a very special little muffin.

Eric, what have we talked about with that language?! One more time and I'm not taking you anywhere!

Oh, you've been so helpful, I uh, just don't know how to thank you.

I mean, what right do I have bringing another child into this overpopulated world? Then again, I should've thought of that before having sex. then againuh-- Oh, I just don't know...

Oh, oh, my goodness no. I haven't used drugs in quite a while.

You have to see the eye doctor, Eric.

Your friends and I have all chipped in and we're going to send you up to a weight-management retreat.

Ooooh, he's just been feeling under the weather. Maybe you boys can cheer him up. He's in the backyard.

Believe it. He lost 40 pounds at his fat camp. 

Hon, are you ready for some math problems?

Thank you so much for babysitting little Eric, Shelly.

Oh, well, I'm not sure. Actually, Eric is still supposed to be grounded for trying to exterminate the Jews two weeks ago.

Oh, that sounds fine. I'm going to a meteor shower party. The number where I'll be is on the refrigerator. Eric's nookie time is 9 o'clock sharp. If his little woogums get cold, you can turn up the heat over here. And if he gets cranky, just play tummy-rub-rubs with him, and make sure he wipes good after he makes bears.

Oh, I should tell my son the truth about everything myself. Good day, Mr. President. 

Oh, my little poopsie-kins gets into no-nos once in a while, but he's still my perfect little plumsy-kiddle

Eric, you have a little visitor. Is that all right? 

Oh, I'm sorry, but I really don't think I can afford this.

I heard he still lives on the Ute reservation just outside of town.

You're very sweet. Thank you again. Come on, muffin. 

And I know it can get scary up in those woods, but just remember, mommy's not far away. 

Hmmm. but you're not out of control, muffin. You're my perfect little gum drop.

And then I saw him. He was the most beautiful, charming piece of ass I'd ever seen in South Park. His name... was Chief Running Water.  I don't recall exactly how the rest of the night went, but the next morning I was pregnant with you, my little blueberry muffin.

Yes. Fifteen of them in one night. Perhaps he should switch toothpaste?

He said he's hungry. What should I do?

I know that the NSA is torturing Santa, sweetie. But they're keeping us safe.

Oh my goodness, I had no idea.  Are you okay, sweetie?

No, sweetie, we have to tend to some of Grandma's business.

But the person at Unplanned Parenthood said you were who I had to talk to about changing the law.

Not too much, hon. It says on the bottle that too much can be bad.

Doctor! Did you find out what's wrong with him?

Oh no uh- I didn't mean that. I meant the other thing you can do-what's that other A word?

You can have an eensy weensy bit, can't you?

Oh, no. Quite the contrary. Eric showed up and surprised me last night. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to present to you... the new Eric Cartman. 

Well, then. I know a certain kitty-kitty who's sleeping with Mommy tonight.

All right, are you little munchkins buckled up for safety?

Oh, I'm so glad to hear it, Mrs. Stotch. Eric has been having some emotional problems lately.

Eric, I got you a new history textbook. Why don't you come downstairs.

...And so you see, Congressman O'Reilly, that's why I think abortion laws should be changed.

Be sure to use lots of bug spray, and if you have to poo-poo, don't wipe with poison ivy. 

We've learned to overcome it, son. You'll see.

Here, look at this one. A Toshiba Handibook.

...And it has basketball courts and tennis courts, and you can call Mommy any time you want.  Oh, sweetie-kins, don't be mad. I'm sure you're going to have a good time. And when you come back you'll be all healthy and thin. 

Um, Sheila, I'm sorry to trouble you with this, but apparently your son has a picture of Eric with another boy's penis in his mouth.

Why hello there. I don't think I've seen you around before. 

Oh, you're sounding just like your old self again.

Eric, Sister Anne has come to visit you.

Oh, sweetie, those were all lies. You're just fat. 

It's almost bedtime. If you sleep then time'll go by faster.

Eric, how would you like to go with me to see Madame Butterfly Friday night?

Well, some more of your little friends are here to play with you. 

Eric, sweetie, there's um, some people here to see you.

Mr. Pharmacist, this Ritalin doesn't have any side effects, does it?

Well, I don't know, Eric. If you did that, then the floors would be bare.

In his room. But, why don't I show you the rest of the house first? 

My little sunshine has a temper sometimes, but he's not all bad.

Right, because it will hybrid with all those other processors and generate a whole new era of technological darkness.

Good night.  What do you have there, Eric?

I'm back, hon. I got some more calamine lotion. 

Come on, Eric. Let's try to battle your Roostor with my Donkeytron.

It's a new way to learn how to read and spell. And it comes with everything you need to help win that spelling bee.  It says we just put the cassette into a tape player 

The KFC in Salida is a long way away, sweetie. Be patient.

Oh, hello sweetie. What did you do today?

Well, it's my son. He's lost a lot of his baby teeth, and I was starting to get worried.

Don't you see, Governor? I should have a right to have an abortion if I want one.

Not really, hon.  Mom has to go now! I'll be home in about an hour!  Oh! Oh, Mr. Mackey!

Eric, you have to come home. You can't just wait here for that game to come out.

Hello, kiddies. I made you all powdered doughnut pancake surprise.

But Eric, I think maybe the tooth fairy wants you to use that money to learn about saving.

Oh, but my poor little poopsie must be getting so hungry. Maybe we should get them a little food.

Oh! And don't mind the cat. She's just being loud because she's in heat.

Ohhh, oh. I'm not sure.  Sweetie, what is your condition?

No, sweetie, the Chinese aren't going to get you.

This party is very loud, boopy-kins. You'll have to speak up.

Eric, you've done a lot of horrible things in your life, but smoking? You're grounded for three weeks!

Eric, I promise you, I didn't do anything to your favorite toy. Whoever did this to you, I hate them as much as you do, and I'd do anything to get to the bottom of it.

Well, I've got an idea. We could sing.

Boopie-kins.  It's time to stop preaching damnation to everyone, sweetie. 

Yes. Every time somebody gets a birthday present Eric gets one too.  Otherwise, he gets a little upset.

Oh. Eric, poopie, sit down.  Mommy has something to tell you. It's just that- well, there is no tooth fairy, Eric. I've been putting all that money under your pillow, and because you got so many teeth fall out, I've actually run out of money and can't go to the grocery store for at least a month.

Tucky tucky time, it's the best time of the night.

It started about four days ago, Doctor, and every day he seems to get worse.

Uhoh, Thanksgiving's still a couple of weeks away, sweetie. I haven't gone shoppies yet.

Oh... N- no, sweetie. I believe those Olympics are just for... "special" children.

Sure, hon. You want some Cheesy Poofs, too?

Hu-old on, dear, let me check.  Hon, I made beefy logs.  I made Cookie Dings.  No, he's not here.

But I just don't think I'm a fit mother.

Oh, that's not funny, boys. Eric isn't fat, his big-boned.

Hang in there, sweetie. We'll be there soon.

Eric honey, time to get up for school. 

Oh no, thank you so much for your time. 

Eric, you do not beat up your friends! And I told you I've had it with your language!  Your punishment is that your friends will just play superheroes without you! Go to your room!

Oh, why yes he did. I thought you were dead, Sharon.

Oh. Well. Would you like some beetles for breakfast? 

Here, I made you powdered donut pancake surprise.

It doesn't seem to work as well when I do it.

Eric? Sweetie, are you having nightmares about the Chinese again?

Yes, darling. You can have whatever you want. 

Don't be difficult, Eric! Now, you go out and play in the fun snow.

Oh, I just can't stand to see my baby suffer

Ah, no, these people claim that they are the "real" psychic detectives. 

Stop crying, Eric! I told you if you kept acting up, you weren't getting anything!

Is he going to be all right, doctor??

Just use a little bit of that stuff, hon. It has to last a while.

Eric, why would you do such a thing?

It's the Toilet Safety Administration, hun. They're gonna do something to the potty.

Yes, but they said two weeks off was enough, and they want everyone back.

This says it does everything the iPad does, at half the price.

And sometimes the man puts his who-who-dilly in the woman's cha-cha. 

Eric, we aren't that much poorer than most people.

Ooohh, hhmmm . Wwell - yyou see, Eric, sometimes when a man and a woman are... attracted to each other , they want to be... close to each other.

Eric, don't you realize you could've seriously injured your little friend?

Eric, I talked to you about beating up your friends, didn't I?

No, it will be fine. How about I make you some hot tea with lemon and codeine?

Well, that's exactly what I intend to do. Good day! 

You have nothing to worry about in school tomorrow. Mrs. Broflovski assured me that Kyle doesn't have the picture.

Well, we're in a tough economy, Eric. I don't know what else you want me to do about it.

Are you sure this is what you want, sweetie?

Boopsie-kins, It's late. You need to be in bed.

Well, why don't you get ready for snoogums' night-night, and I'll bring you some toasty chocolate nummers?

Hello. Um, I would like to... sign my son up, please.

Oh dear.
Dr. Doctor:
But I'm more concerned about his state of mind. Your son appears to be completely insane.

I'm sorry, Eric. All children find out sooner or later.

Ooo, he loves playing with his Clyde Frog and Wellington Bear.

Oh, that's so sweet. Oh, I love you too, poopiekins! 

Sweetie, your friends are downstairs. They need to see you.

Oh it's so good to have you acting like yourself again, sweetie.

Eric? Poopsiekins?  Eric?  Honey, maybe that's enough computer time. It's been about nineteen hours now.  I know you said not to disturb you with your new toy, but Mommy thought maybe you needed to eat?  All right, I'll just leave it here, hon.  I'm turning in for the night. Mommy loves you.

You made me look like some sort of child molester in front of all those people!

It's too far and your parents want you back home.

Oh my God! Eric! Eric,  Mommy's here. Sweetie?  Oh, what's wrong with him?

Oooo, looks like the tooth fairy was extra-happy with youuu. 

Oh, it's my pleasure. Eric loves his little friends.

Well, what's a nice, handsome, black  man like yourself doing in a pit like South Park?

Oh, he's amazing. I think the change in personality happened. He's doing things for himself now, and he seems to be accepting it. I've lost a best friend, but I've gained a son.

Oh, thank you so much for coming. Please come in. 

Oh, heck. I haven't even started yet. He-he.  I baked cookiees; would anybody like one?! 

Well, all right.  I guess I can get some groceries anyway. 

Sweetie, Bill Gates is on the phone for you.

Oh well, no TV for him for a few days.

It's going to be okay, baby. We're going to get you more time.

But, honey, it's only September. That...  Nintendo Wii doesn't come out for two months.

Come on, Chef! Haven't you ever heard of a manage o'three?

Thank you so much for allowing Eric and I to stay here.

You are, hon, but... I don't think that's a very good idea. 

Now Eric, this has gone far enough!  You need to learn to be patient!

Well, I'm letting Eric go to the camp. I mean, it seems to me this Chinpokomon thing is just another harmless fad.

How about a nice chocolate chicken pot pie, then?

Oh dear. I don't know what else to do about my son's behavioral problems. We've been through every nanny reality show on television.

There you are, Eric. What are you doing here?

Aunt Lisa, Cousin Fred, Cousin Alexandra , Fat Bob, Jimmy , and great-grandma Florence. 

Look what I did, Eric. I learned how to make Sumie paintings. I had almost forgotten how artistic I was.

Ohh, it's a little late, sweetie. Why don't you boys just keep playing downstairs?

I know you're in a very dark place now, sweetie. But you must come toward the light! Come toward the light!

Mmmm-my, how exciting. Would you care to... put your tongue in my mouth?

Uh, sweetie, your friends wanted to have a "talk" with you.

Go ahead, snookums. It's probably one of your little friends.

Oh, hello boys. Have you seen Eric around anywhere?

Eric, where have you been? It's ten thirty.
