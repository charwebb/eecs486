Hang in there, sweetie. We'll be there soon.
You are, hon, but... I don't think that's a very good idea. 
Oh dear.
Dr. Doctor:
But I'm more concerned about his state of mind. Your son appears to be completely insane.
Be sure to use lots of bug spray, and if you have to poo-poo, don't wipe with poison ivy. 
Oh, but my poor little poopsie must be getting so hungry. Maybe we should get them a little food.
Oh... But I thought we were becoming friends.
There you are, Eric. What are you doing here?
Oh, it's my pleasure. Eric loves his little friends.
Doctor! Did you find out what's wrong with him?
Well, Eric, there's nothing more I can do about it.
Eric, I got you a new history textbook. Why don't you come downstairs.
...And so you see, Congressman O'Reilly, that's why I think abortion laws should be changed.
Not too much, hon. It says on the bottle that too much can be bad.
Uh sweetie, I see that you're a little... disturbed right now, but, maybe you can-
Not really, hon.  Mom has to go now! I'll be home in about an hour!  Oh! Oh, Mr. Mackey!
This party is very loud, boopy-kins. You'll have to speak up.
Eric, how would you like to go with me to see Madame Butterfly Friday night?
The best part is I'm not letting him boss me around anymore. I could have never come out and have a nice lunch on a Saturday afternoon with a friend before.
You can have an eensy weensy bit, can't you?
I know. I know he's out of control. But... you don't know what it's like.  I'm sorry. It's just that... he seems to get worse every day.  He just never listens.
Ohh, it's a little late, sweetie. Why don't you boys just keep playing downstairs?
Your friends and I have all chipped in and we're going to send you up to a weight-management retreat.
Oh, Eric, it's just part of being a child.
Boopie-kins.  It's time to stop preaching damnation to everyone, sweetie. 
Sure, hon. You want some Cheesy Poofs, too?
If you're really sorry, then you'll understand why you aren't getting anything!
I know you're in a very dark place now, sweetie. But you must come toward the light! Come toward the light!
I asked little Eric where he would feel safest, and he said with his friend Token.
Hello, everybody.  Now, just do it like we rehearsed, hon.
It started about four days ago, Doctor, and every day he seems to get worse.
Oh, all right. I was just at the store buying some apples.
Well, I think you need to keep your laws off of my body.
Eric, I'm working two jobs. Mommy's doing everything she can.
Eric? Poopsiekins?  Eric?  Honey, maybe that's enough computer time. It's been about nineteen hours now.  I know you said not to disturb you with your new toy, but Mommy thought maybe you needed to eat?  All right, I'll just leave it here, hon.  I'm turning in for the night. Mommy loves you.
Eric, I promise you, I didn't do anything to your favorite toy. Whoever did this to you, I hate them as much as you do, and I'd do anything to get to the bottom of it.
Now Eric, this has gone far enough!  You need to learn to be patient!
Oh, no. Quite the contrary. Eric showed up and surprised me last night. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to present to you... the new Eric Cartman. 
Well, I'm letting Eric go to the camp. I mean, it seems to me this Chinpokomon thing is just another harmless fad.
But the person at Unplanned Parenthood said you were who I had to talk to about changing the law.
Excuse me, shouldn't we wait for everyone to arrive before we get started?
Oh, I'm sorry, but I really don't think I can afford this.
Oohh, you look great, hon. Mommy's fat little piggy.
Ah, no, these people claim that they are the "real" psychic detectives. 
No, you don't have to fly to Russia, hon.
Come on, Chef! Haven't you ever heard of a manage o'three?
It's not him, it's you, Eric.  I don't know what to do with you.
Sweetie, let the nice firemen do their job.
She talked with her son and says he doesn't have it.
Oh, I just can't stand to see my baby suffer
No, sweetie, we have to tend to some of Grandma's business.
Oh my goodness, I had no idea.  Are you okay, sweetie?
Oh, you've finally come back! It's a miracle!
Well, what if I took you to Kentucky Fried Chicken afterward?  And then we'll go to Target and buy you a Mega Ranger.
Oh wait, wait.  You've got a little eye booger, hon.
Sweetie, there's a Mr. Pun Li Tsiao on the phone for you?
I'm back, hon. I got some more calamine lotion. 
No, it will be fine. How about I make you some hot tea with lemon and codeine?
Oh. Well. Would you like some beetles for breakfast? 
Nnno, I got you something that's going to help you win the big spelling bee tomorrow.
Come on. Do you want your laser corrective surgery or not?
Believe it. He lost 40 pounds at his fat camp. 
But, honey, it's only September. That...  Nintendo Wii doesn't come out for two months.
Oh dear... I was checking out the Internet and ih, it almost seems like his symptoms are like those in something called "Tour, Tourette's Syndrome"?
Oh, that sounds fine. I'm going to a meteor shower party. The number where I'll be is on the refrigerator. Eric's nookie time is 9 o'clock sharp. If his little woogums get cold, you can turn up the heat over here. And if he gets cranky, just play tummy-rub-rubs with him, and make sure he wipes good after he makes bears.
There you are, Eric! Come on, we have to go to the eye doctor.
Boopsie-kins, It's late. You need to be in bed.
Eric, you've done a lot of horrible things in your life, but smoking? You're grounded for three weeks!
Yes they are, but you were supposed to be grounded in your room! And now you're more grounded, young man!
My little sunshine has a temper sometimes, but he's not all bad.
Well, we're in a tough economy, Eric. I don't know what else you want me to do about it.
That's okay, Eric, I think you need to go spend time with your little friends.
Come on, sweetie. Doctor says you need to get home and get lots of rest.
I know that the NSA is torturing Santa, sweetie. But they're keeping us safe.
Oooh, what should I do? I'm playing roulette with my child's life!  Ooo wait, Hairspray is showing in New York, isn't it? Let's go there.
Oh, yes. When I was a child, my mother had me go over to a little girl's house who had the chickenpox, just so I would get it.
Well, what's a nice, handsome, black  man like yourself doing in a pit like South Park?
Here, I made you powdered donut pancake surprise.
Oh. Well, I'll tell Eric. He's just down in the basement playing with his dolls. 
Cartman. Yesuh- it's such a hard decision, but I just don't feel I can raise a child in this screwy world.
My little Eric can sometimes be a bit... dramatic. 
Oh, what a party that was!  Hmm-hm-hm-hmm. Hmm-hm-hm-hmm. 
Oh, a- a- all right, sweetie, I- I'll take you tomorrow.
...And it has basketball courts and tennis courts, and you can call Mommy any time you want.  Oh, sweetie-kins, don't be mad. I'm sure you're going to have a good time. And when you come back you'll be all healthy and thin. 
Come on, Eric. Let's try to battle your Roostor with my Donkeytron.
Oh it's so good to have you acting like yourself again, sweetie.
Why hello there. I don't think I've seen you around before. 
Eric, Sister Anne has come to visit you.
Oh, why yes he did. I thought you were dead, Sharon.
Oh, but I suppose it would be good for him. Yes, of course he can go. I'll bring some of clothes over.
Eric, the day I met your father it was like - magic! It was a beautiful autumn night when the aspen trees were turning, at the Twelfth Annual Drunken Barn Dance. 
In his room. But, why don't I show you the rest of the house first? 
He said he's hungry. What should I do?
I guess it's much better to get it when you're young.
It's the Toilet Safety Administration, hun. They're gonna do something to the potty.
I'm sorry, Eric. All children find out sooner or later.
You have been bad, so you're gonna have to drink from this glass. 
Oh, I should tell my son the truth about everything myself. Good day, Mr. President. 
Oohh, honey, why don't you make it yourself?  Mommy's  expecting  some company.
Ohhh, oh. I'm not sure.  Sweetie, what is your condition?
Oooo, looks like the tooth fairy was extra-happy with youuu. 
Oh... N- no, sweetie. I believe those Olympics are just for... "special" children.
Well, then. I know a certain kitty-kitty who's sleeping with Mommy tonight.
Oh no, thank you so much for your time. 
It's going to be okay, baby. We're going to get you more time.
Oh, I've told him to respect people's property. What did he take?
Here we go, kids. We're crossing the state line into Nebraska. 
Eric, snookums! it's time for Mommy to tuck you into your snuggleboat for night-night.  Eric, are you out there in your clubhouse?
Oh, Chief. I want your hot man chowder.
I think we need to get you a different brand, hon. They're a little cheaper.
Tucky tucky time, it's the best time of the night.
Eric, if you don't want to eat then, why don't you go brush your teeth and go to bed?!
Oh, he will. My little poopsiekins is a very good little boy.
All right, are you little munchkins buckled up for safety?
You made me look like some sort of child molester in front of all those people!
Eric, please. We have to do some studying today.
Oh my God! Eric! Eric,  Mommy's here. Sweetie?  Oh, what's wrong with him?
Oh, that's not funny, boys. Eric isn't fat, his big-boned.
Eric, don't you realize you could've seriously injured your little friend?
Oh Cesar, I'm so happy to have you in my life. 
Thank you so much for babysitting little Eric, Shelly.
Eric, stop acting like a spoiled brat! You can either have the Toshiba Handibook or you can have nothing at all!
And sometimes the man puts his who-who-dilly in the woman's cha-cha. 
We've learned to overcome it, son. You'll see.
And I know it can get scary up in those woods, but just remember, mommy's not far away. 
Well, I've got an idea. We could sing.
It's almost bedtime. If you sleep then time'll go by faster.
Eric, did you say 'hi' to your little cousin Elvin?
Stanley told me you had passed on. I'm glad to see that you're better.
And then I saw him. He was the most beautiful, charming piece of ass I'd ever seen in South Park. His name... was Chief Running Water.  I don't recall exactly how the rest of the night went, but the next morning I was pregnant with you, my little blueberry muffin.
Well, then, now you should take that money and open up a savings account that has compounded daily interest.
Oh, he's been amazing, Cesar. He got an A on his last spelling test and a B+ in history. He's losing weight and he's doing what I tell him.
Oh, heck. I haven't even started yet. He-he.  I baked cookiees; would anybody like one?! 
Eric honey, time to get up for school. 
Hello, kiddies. I made you all powdered doughnut pancake surprise.
Here hon, I packed you some cheesy poofs and happy tarts.
Yes, darling. You can have whatever you want. 
Do you see that, Sheila? The Williamses are shopping here.
But I just don't think I'm a fit mother.
These are Eric's friends: Stan, Kyle, and Kenny. Boys, let me introduce you to the Cartman family. This is Uncle Stinky.
You're the best, Cesar, and to show my gratitude I've got two tickets for you and me to see Madame Butterfly this Friday night.
Well, he's just... out of control. I mean, he never listens to me, and he pretty much runs my life.
Well, Sheila, we can't shelter our boys forever from these things. Maybe it's okay for them to see an adult film.
Oh, my. The tooth fairy will have to give you a big surprise for losing two teeth in two days.
Oh, oh, my goodness no. I haven't used drugs in quite a while.
Ooo, he loves playing with his Clyde Frog and Wellington Bear.
Oh no uh- I didn't mean that. I meant the other thing you can do-what's that other A word?
Hello. Um, I would like to... sign my son up, please.
Eric dear? I just got a call from your friend Kyle's mother. She said that this show is naughty, and might make you a potty mouth.
Aunt Lisa, Cousin Fred, Cousin Alexandra , Fat Bob, Jimmy , and great-grandma Florence. 
Hon, are you ready for some math problems?
It's a new way to learn how to read and spell. And it comes with everything you need to help win that spelling bee.  It says we just put the cassette into a tape player 
Eric, we aren't that much poorer than most people.
Eric, I want you to go upstairs and brush your teeth. Then I'll be up to read you a story before bed.  Oh my goodness. I can't believe it.
Hehh, it doesn't look like our protest is working.
Good night.  What do you have there, Eric?
Oh, you're sounding just like your old self again.
Now, Eric, let's try to get out of that grumpy mood before we get to Grandma's.
Over the meadow and through the woods
Don't you see, Governor? I should have a right to have an abortion if I want one.
Sweetie, Bill Gates is on the phone for you.
But Eric, I think maybe the tooth fairy wants you to use that money to learn about saving.
No, honey, Mommy's gotta save her throat. I have to work tonight.
Yes, but they said two weeks off was enough, and they want everyone back.
I made some healthy tofu pudding to celebrate. Who wants some?
That shouldn't be a problem. Eric's Grandma is right near the mall.
Stop crying, Eric! I told you if you kept acting up, you weren't getting anything!
Eric, I talked to you about beating up your friends, didn't I?
Here, look at this one. A Toshiba Handibook.
Here, Kyle. Will you hold Great-Grandma's catheter bag during dinner? 
It doesn't seem to work as well when I do it.
Oh! And don't mind the cat. She's just being loud because she's in heat.
Is he going to be all right, doctor??
Wheat. The building block of your favorite foods, and, Nebraska's principal source of economic productivity. You see, when Nebraska first became--
Ooh, sweetums, did you laugh too hard again?
Eric, you have to come home. You can't just wait here for that game to come out.
Look what I did, Eric. I learned how to make Sumie paintings. I had almost forgotten how artistic I was.
Oh, hello boys. Have you seen Eric around anywhere?
I heard he still lives on the Ute reservation just outside of town.
Eric?  It must be his time. I think it's running out!
Oh, he's amazing. I think the change in personality happened. He's doing things for himself now, and he seems to be accepting it. I've lost a best friend, but I've gained a son.
I'm sorry I never told you, Eric.  I just thought, maybe it would be a little shocking to you.
Yes. Fifteen of them in one night. Perhaps he should switch toothpaste?
Eric, sweetie, there's um, some people here to see you.
There's just one problem: he still fights me every step of the way. I feel like he's doing what I tell him, but that inside he's still the same angry spoiled child.
Thank you so much for allowing Eric and I to stay here.
Oh, thank you so much for coming. Please come in. 
I love you very much, poopsiekins. You're Mommy's sunshine. 
Eric, we're almost to Frisco. Why don't we go to the Church's Fried Chicken there?
I mean, what right do I have bringing another child into this overpopulated world? Then again, I should've thought of that before having sex. then againuh-- Oh, I just don't know...
Eric, what have we talked about with that language?! One more time and I'm not taking you anywhere!
Well, it's my son. He's lost a lot of his baby teeth, and I was starting to get worried.
Don't be difficult, Eric! Now, you go out and play in the fun snow.
Oh, hello sweetie. What did you do today?
Oh dear. I don't know what else to do about my son's behavioral problems. We've been through every nanny reality show on television.
Mr. Pharmacist, this Ritalin doesn't have any side effects, does it?
Mmmm-my, how exciting. Would you care to... put your tongue in my mouth?
Oh, there there, sweetie. It'll be okay. These things happen.
Well, all right.  I guess I can get some groceries anyway. 
Well, some more of your little friends are here to play with you. 
Eric, why would you do such a thing?
Great-grandma has a bladder problem. This helps her out.
Oh, my little poopsie-kins gets into no-nos once in a while, but he's still my perfect little plumsy-kiddle
Just use a little bit of that stuff, hon. It has to last a while.
Sweetie, your friends are downstairs. They need to see you.
Oh, that's so sweet. Oh, I love you too, poopiekins! 
Hmmm. but you're not out of control, muffin. You're my perfect little gum drop.
Ooohh, hhmmm . Wwell - yyou see, Eric, sometimes when a man and a woman are... attracted to each other , they want to be... close to each other.
And don't get too close to Kyle. He looks like he might have the AIDS. 
Yes. Every time somebody gets a birthday present Eric gets one too.  Otherwise, he gets a little upset.
I just, I- I'm gonna go make you kids some lemonade. 
This says it does everything the iPad does, at half the price.
Oh I never saw him after that. Ah-I wasn't really that interested in him.
Eric, you do not beat up your friends! And I told you I've had it with your language!  Your punishment is that your friends will just play superheroes without you! Go to your room!
Then why did you go outside to a police officer and say "Help! Help! My mommy is trying to fuck me!"?
No, sweetie, the Chinese aren't going to get you.
Oh my! She must think that you are a very special little muffin.
No, sweetie, I've been at the hair salon. Why?
Oh, I'm so glad to hear it, Mrs. Stotch. Eric has been having some emotional problems lately.
Well, I certainly won't buy him anymore, then... Bill. 
Okay, muffin. Mommy's leaving now. You do what the babysitter tells you, okay?
It's okay, Eric. I'll have a talk with Kyle's mother.
Hu-old on, dear, let me check.  Hon, I made beefy logs.  I made Cookie Dings.  No, he's not here.
Oh. Ah, I'm white trash and I'm in trouble.
Oh, you've been so helpful, I uh, just don't know how to thank you.
Uhoh, Thanksgiving's still a couple of weeks away, sweetie. I haven't gone shoppies yet.
How about a nice chocolate chicken pot pie, then?
I'm making you some lunch right now, Eric.
Eric, you have a little visitor. Is that all right? 
No no no, that's impossible, hon. I told her: no visitors.
Eric, where have you been? It's ten thirty.
Well, that's exactly what I intend to do. Good day! 
What do you say, champ? Think you can tough it out?
You're very sweet. Thank you again. Come on, muffin.
