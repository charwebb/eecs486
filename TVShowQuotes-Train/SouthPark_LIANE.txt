Don't be difficult, Eric! Now, you go out and play in the fun snow.

Everything okay, sweetie?

Okay, muffin. Mommy's leaving now. You do what the babysitter tells you, okay?

Poopsiekins!  Sweetie, what is the-  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!

But what if he does run away.

What do you mean "what should-"

Oooooohh.

Come on. Do you want your laser corrective surgery or not?

Hello, kiddies. I made you all powdered doughnut pancake surprise.

No, honey. It's just-

No!

Eric! Eric, wait!

Eric, I promise you, I didn't do anything to your favorite toy. Whoever did this to you, I hate them as much as you do, and I'd do anything to get to the bottom of it.

Please, come in.

Oh dear... I was checking out the Internet and ih, it almost seems like his symptoms are like those in something called "Tour, Tourette's Syndrome"?

Eric, sweetie, there's um, some people here to see you.

Oh. Ah, I'm white trash and I'm in trouble.

That shouldn't be a problem. Eric's Grandma is right near the mall.

Oh, hello boys.

I'm sorry, Eric. All children find out sooner or later.

Oh, heck. I haven't even started yet. He-he.  I baked cookiees; would anybody like one?! 

Oh, that's so sweet. Oh, I love you too, poopiekins! 

Oh, well, I'm not sure. Actually, Eric is still supposed to be grounded for trying to exterminate the Jews two weeks ago.

Eric, you have to come home. You can't just wait here for that game to come out.

Doctor! Did you find out what's wrong with him?

Get it down.

What hon?

Oh, baby, your time is back!

Stanley told me you had passed on. I'm glad to see that you're better.

I know. I know he's out of control. But... you don't know what it's like.  I'm sorry. It's just that... he seems to get worse every day.  He just never listens.

She said she was sure, Eric.

Well you should've called Mommy.

Do you see that, Sheila? The Williamses are shopping here.

But the person at Unplanned Parenthood said you were who I had to talk to about changing the law.

No, hon.

What, hon?

Right, because it will hybrid with all those other processors and generate a whole new era of technological darkness.

When does it come out?

Around six hours.

Yes, but they said two weeks off was enough, and they want everyone back.

Eric Cartman...

Mommy's busy, boopie-kins.

Well, I think you need to keep your laws off of my body.

How are you doing?

Here, Kyle. Will you hold Great-Grandma's catheter bag during dinner? 

Don't you see, Governor? I should have a right to have an abortion if I want one.

Now Eric, this has gone far enough!  You need to learn to be patient!

Here, I made you powdered donut pancake surprise.

Oh, that's so nice.

Oh, I'm sorry, but I really don't think I can afford this.

Bye, kids. 

Oh, here's the doctors now! Hi, doctor.

Come on, Eric. Let's try to battle your Roostor with my Donkeytron.

Tsst. 

They say it's an emergency.

I thought you got it.

Safety belt?

But I just don't think I'm a fit mother.

Why Eric, you made your own breakfast.

Okay.

It's the most wonderful time of the year
do do do do do do do do-

Eskimo kisses for Mom-my!

Now, hon.

Yes hon?

Eric, you're just going to have to be patient. 

Yes?  Oh hi.

Eric.  The babysitter's here. Come on downstairs.

Oh dear.

Eric, please. We have to do some studying today.

Eric Cartman!

I guess it's much better to get it when you're young.

He's nine.

Eric?  It must be his time. I think it's running out!

Oh, you're sounding just like your old self again.

Oh, what is it this time? 

Be sure to use lots of bug spray, and if you have to poo-poo, don't wipe with poison ivy. 

You have been bad, so you're gonna have to drink from this glass. 

Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah!

Yes, it's true.

Nnno, I got you something that's going to help you win the big spelling bee tomorrow.

Oh no, thank you so much for your time. 

Oooohh, Chef! Woooo, Chef!

Eric, you're coming home right now!

Oh, all right. 

...And so you see, Congressman O'Reilly, that's why I think abortion laws should be changed.

Come down as soon as you're done. 

About another hour, hon.

What is it, snookums?

You're the best, Cesar, and to show my gratitude I've got two tickets for you and me to see Madame Butterfly this Friday night.

What is it, sweetie?

Sweetie, there's a Mr. Pun Li Tsiao on the phone for you?

Ohh, that's nice.

Oohh, you look great, hon. Mommy's fat little piggy.

Oh... But I thought we were becoming friends.

Not too much, hon. It says on the bottle that too much can be bad.

What?

Eric, we aren't that much poorer than most people.

Eight years old.

Whoa, Chef!  You're so strong!

Oh.  Well, goodbye, sweetie.

Oh my goodness.

I'm making you some lunch right now, Eric.

Well, we're in a tough economy, Eric. I don't know what else you want me to do about it.

Oh sure. 

Eric dear? I just got a call from your friend Kyle's mother. She said that this show is naughty, and might make you a potty mouth.

I made some healthy tofu pudding to celebrate. Who wants some?

Ohho, Carol, where are the Porto-Potties?

Oh, Eric dear. It's what's best.

He's never done this before.

Eric, you've done a lot of horrible things in your life, but smoking? You're grounded for three weeks!

Eric, you do not beat up your friends! And I told you I've had it with your language!  Your punishment is that your friends will just play superheroes without you! Go to your room!

I asked little Eric where he would feel safest, and he said with his friend Token.

Here hon, I packed you some cheesy poofs and happy tarts.

Eric, I want you to go upstairs and brush your teeth. Then I'll be up to read you a story before bed.  Oh my goodness. I can't believe it.

Is it over? 

Oooh, I'll go make some tea.

Ohhh, okay hon.

I'm glad you're not that bad, poopsie-kins

The KFC in Salida is a long way away, sweetie. Be patient.

Oh, why yes he did. I thought you were dead, Sharon.

That's my little boy. 

I heard he still lives on the Ute reservation just outside of town.

What can we do?

Tucky tucky time, it's the best time of the night.

The best part is I'm not letting him boss me around anymore. I could have never come out and have a nice lunch on a Saturday afternoon with a friend before.

Oh, that's not funny, boys. Eric isn't fat, his big-boned.

Sounds divine!

Yes. Apples.  Ahapples, get it? 

I'm so proud of you, Eric.

The what?

Oh. Well, I'll tell Eric. He's just down in the basement playing with his dolls. 

There you are, Eric. What are you doing here?

Eric, stop it!

That's okay, Eric, I think you need to go spend time with your little friends.

Eric? Sweetie, are you having nightmares about the Chinese again?

Uh sweetie, I see that you're a little... disturbed right now, but, maybe you can-

Eric, I talked to you about beating up your friends, didn't I?

Oh my God! Eric!

Eric, you have a little visitor. Is that all right? 

Yes, hon? 

Hu-old on, dear, let me check.  Hon, I made beefy logs.  I made Cookie Dings.  No, he's not here.

What's going on?

Mmmm-my, how exciting. Would you care to... put your tongue in my mouth?

No please!

Yes hon?

But Eric, I think maybe the tooth fairy wants you to use that money to learn about saving.

Excuse me, shouldn't we wait for everyone to arrive before we get started?

Oh, he will. My little poopsiekins is a very good little boy.

You have nothing to worry about in school tomorrow. Mrs. Broflovski assured me that Kyle doesn't have the picture.

Hmmm. 

Ssshhh, pumpkin, it's almost over.

You give your mommy a kissy.

Sweetie, don't.

Is there a problem, sweetie?

Eh yes, sweetie.

Well, Eric, there's nothing more I can do about it.

Well, he's just... out of control. I mean, he never listens to me, and he pretty much runs my life.

Oh... 

Ohhh, yes, indeedy. 

Eric, you come home, right now!

Good night.  What do you have there, Eric?

Oh, no. Quite the contrary. Eric showed up and surprised me last night. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to present to you... the new Eric Cartman. 

What is the picture of, Eric? 

Tsst.

Oh...

Yes. Fifteen of them in one night. Perhaps he should switch toothpaste?

Yes they are, but you were supposed to be grounded in your room! And now you're more grounded, young man!

Tsst. 

It started about four days ago, Doctor, and every day he seems to get worse.

Eric, Mommy got you a present!

Hello, boys.

Sure, hon. You want some Cheesy Poofs, too?

Oh, it's my pleasure. Eric loves his little friends.

Oh, all right. I was just at the store buying some apples.

I'm sorry, hon,

I know you're in a very dark place now, sweetie. But you must come toward the light! Come toward the light!

Well, some more of your little friends are here to play with you. 

Ohhh...

Oh, sweetie, $900?

Ooh, I'm sorry to hear that, Stanley.

Well, all right.  I guess I can get some groceries anyway. 

Eric, poopsie?

Oh, he's such a cutie.

Eric, are you listening to me?!

My little sunshine has a temper sometimes, but he's not all bad.

Don't pick your nose, hon.

Mr. Pharmacist, this Ritalin doesn't have any side effects, does it?

Don't be nervous. I'm sure you'll win.

Oh, I should tell my son the truth about everything myself. Good day, Mr. President. 

Be careful with my baby.

Well, Sheila, we can't shelter our boys forever from these things. Maybe it's okay for them to see an adult film.

Sweetie.

Sure, hon.

Oh. Well. Would you like some beetles for breakfast? 

Oohh, that's a big boy, isn't he? 

Whoa!

That's nice, poopie. 

You're going to be okay, baby.

Yes, hon?

Oh, you've finally come back! It's a miracle!

Great-grandma has a bladder problem. This helps her out.

Tsst.

Sorry, hon.

Oh. 

Oh, oh, my goodness no. I haven't used drugs in quite a while.

You're very sweet. Thank you again. Come on, muffin. 

Eric, the day I met your father it was like - magic! It was a beautiful autumn night when the aspen trees were turning, at the Twelfth Annual Drunken Barn Dance. 

Ooooh, he's just been feeling under the weather. Maybe you boys can cheer him up. He's in the backyard.

Oh my goodness, I had no idea.  Are you okay, sweetie?

Oh... N- no, sweetie. I believe those Olympics are just for... "special" children.

Oh, I mean, sex and drugs.

O-oh, thank you. Freebie next week. 

Ah, no, these people claim that they are the "real" psychic detectives. 

Oh, my. The tooth fairy will have to give you a big surprise for losing two teeth in two days.

Sweetie, you really can just talk to me if you-

It's okay, Eric. I'll have a talk with Kyle's mother.

I am the pack leader! 

How's the treehouse coming along, hon?

Are you sure this is what you want, sweetie?

About eight years ago.

Yes?

Yes. Every time somebody gets a birthday present Eric gets one too.  Otherwise, he gets a little upset.

Boopsie-kins, It's late. You need to be in bed.

Poopsiekins, wake up. Wake up, honey.

No, sweetie, we have to tend to some of Grandma's business.

It's almost bedtime. If you sleep then time'll go by faster.

All those other babysitters won't come back.

Oh, but I thought your teacher died.

No no no, that's impossible, hon. I told her: no visitors.

Aww, what happened, hun?

What is it, Eric?

I mean, what right do I have bringing another child into this overpopulated world? Then again, I should've thought of that before having sex. then againuh-- Oh, I just don't know...

Right away, hon. 

Um, Sheila, I'm sorry to trouble you with this, but apparently your son has a picture of Eric with another boy's penis in his mouth.

He's an imspration to us all.

Oh, I'm so glad to hear it, Mrs. Stotch. Eric has been having some emotional problems lately.

There you are, Eric.

Eric, this is for the best.

You have to get ready for school

Ohoho, nhn.

Oh Cesar, I'm so happy to have you in my life. 

Eric!

No- Eric, stay in the car, sweetie!

Would you boys like some Cheesy Poofs?

Oh my! She must think that you are a very special little muffin.

Is he going to be all right, doctor??

Ooh, sweetums, did you laugh too hard again?

Oh, what is it?

Got it. 

What's that, Eric?

That's a great idea, Chef.

Yes. I think it's the nanny, boopsiekins.

Hi, kids. I'm home.

You mean...

What what is it that you're doing?

In a minute, sweetie. This is important.

Well, no, I don't.

Coma... My God, fo- for how long?

This says it does everything the iPad does, at half the price.

Yeah, it's best to avoid his level.

And I know it can get scary up in those woods, but just remember, mommy's not far away. 

Yes.

Oh, there there, sweetie. It'll be okay. These things happen.

Oh dear. I don't know what else to do about my son's behavioral problems. We've been through every nanny reality show on television.

Eric, it's important for you to understand-.

She talked with her son and says he doesn't have it.

I'll think about it, hon.

Well, it's my son. He's lost a lot of his baby teeth, and I was starting to get worried.

Oh, hello sweetie. What did you do today?

Eric, your little friends are here.

More pie, hon?

My little Eric can sometimes be a bit... dramatic. 

Yes, Mysterion?

Eric, sweetie, is everything okay?

Oh, dear!

Oooh, I'm gonna decorate the house for Halloween,
with scary ghosts and bats and creepy crawly things...
Hello there!

You want some more Cheesy Poofs hon?

Go ahead, snookums. It's probably one of your little friends.

Oh, Poopie-kins, it's very early.

No, Rumpertumskin, I didn't. I swear.

Oh Eric, I'm so happy you're home.

I was young and naive then... 

He said he's hungry. What should I do?

What's the matter, sweetie?

Come on, Chef! Haven't you ever heard of a manage o'three?

You're doing so much better, muffin.

Here, look at this one. A Toshiba Handibook.

Hello, Sheila? It's Liane, Eric's mother.

Oh, he's been amazing, Cesar. He got an A on his last spelling test and a B+ in history. He's losing weight and he's doing what I tell him.

Eric, what have we talked about with that language?! One more time and I'm not taking you anywhere!

Thank you so much for allowing Eric and I to stay here.

Well, what does he need?

It doesn't seem to work as well when I do it.

Alright! let's go. 

Don't say "tits," Eric.

You have?

Eric, calm down. 

This party is very loud, boopy-kins. You'll have to speak up.

Oo, poopiekins?

No, you don't have to fly to Russia, hon.

Oh, but we really need some help. 

No, sweetie, I've been at the hair salon. Why?

Oh dear. 

Eric, why would you do such a thing?

Okay, hon.

Believe it. He lost 40 pounds at his fat camp. 

Hello, Eric.

Here we are. 

Come this way, Billy. 

Now, Eric, let's try to get out of that grumpy mood before we get to Grandma's.
Over the meadow and through the woods

I DON'T!

Well, what's a nice, handsome, black  man like yourself doing in a pit like South Park?

Alright.

Oh... Oh my gosh!

All, all right dear. 

Whoa. Easy, Kyle.

Don't apologize to us, apologize to him!

They're so strange. Where are they from?

Terminated?

Eric, how would you like to go with me to see Madame Butterfly Friday night?

I'm sorry I never told you, Eric.  I just thought, maybe it would be a little shocking to you.

Oh, yes. When I was a child, my mother had me go over to a little girl's house who had the chickenpox, just so I would get it.

Ahall right.

Where have you been, young man?!

His new... powers?

Sweetie, shhh, tell Mommy what happened.

Honey, it's okay.

You're not fat, you're big-boned.

Eric, naughty.

It's not him, it's you, Eric.  I don't know what to do with you.

Cartman. Yesuh- it's such a hard decision, but I just don't feel I can raise a child in this screwy world.

Aunt Lisa, Cousin Fred, Cousin Alexandra , Fat Bob, Jimmy , and great-grandma Florence. 

Oh, very good, sweetie.

Oh! And don't mind the cat. She's just being loud because she's in heat.

Ooo, careful hon. These roads are bumpy.

Come on, kiddies. Eat more.

...I'm sorry, Eric. The answer is No. 

Oh my goodness, what's going on?

...What!?

Ooh, I have them somewhere else, boopiekins.

Oohh, honey, why don't you make it yourself?  Mommy's  expecting  some company.

Eric, you wanna say hi to Grandpa?

Oh, thank you so much for coming. Please come in. 

But, honey, it's only September. That...  Nintendo Wii doesn't come out for two months.

Wow, I have a lot to learn.

It'll make your itches go away. 

What?

Hello?

Eric, sshhhh. 

Oh, but I suppose it would be good for him. Yes, of course he can go. I'll bring some of clothes over.

Oh. Well,  alrighty then.

Hi, sweetie.

And you're studying before school?

It's too far and your parents want you back home.

Ah-are you okay, hon?

No, no, Florence, that's not Eric.

Eric, look who's here.

Just a weensy geensy woo woo?

Sweetiekins, are you all right?

Ohhh, oh. I'm not sure.  Sweetie, what is your condition?

Eric, I got you a new history textbook. Why don't you come downstairs.

No, honey, Mommy's gotta save her throat. I have to work tonight.

Not really, hon.  Mom has to go now! I'll be home in about an hour!  Oh! Oh, Mr. Mackey!

Oh dear.
Dr. Doctor:
But I'm more concerned about his state of mind. Your son appears to be completely insane.

Eric, get out of there. 

Be good.

Yes, darling. You can have whatever you want. 

Here, I got you some calamine lotion. 

Mmmm. Beetles are good with ice cream.

Oh it's so good to have you acting like yourself again, sweetie.

Eric? What's the, what's the matter? 

Well, then, now you should take that money and open up a savings account that has compounded daily interest.

I want to have... an abortion.

You all right, sweetie?

Now, hon!

There you are, Eric! Come on, we have to go to the eye doctor.

Well, all right.

Oh my God! Eric! Eric,  Mommy's here. Sweetie?  Oh, what's wrong with him?

What is it, hon?

Wait. Wait.  Who is that?  Chief... could you excuse me for a minute?

It's the Toilet Safety Administration, hun. They're gonna do something to the potty.

These are Eric's friends: Stan, Kyle, and Kenny. Boys, let me introduce you to the Cartman family. This is Uncle Stinky.

Thank you.  Don't pick your nose, hon.

Eric, don't you realize you could've seriously injured your little friend?

How about a nice chocolate chicken pot pie, then?

Squeaker! 

...And it has basketball courts and tennis courts, and you can call Mommy any time you want.  Oh, sweetie-kins, don't be mad. I'm sure you're going to have a good time. And when you come back you'll be all healthy and thin. 

Yup, just like you said he would.

Oh God!  Oh no!

Oh, you've been so helpful, I uh, just don't know how to thank you.

Hello, everybody.  Now, just do it like we rehearsed, hon.

Oh baby baby, you can't die.

Don't pick your nose, hon.

Here we go, kids. We're crossing the state line into Nebraska. 

Oh, don't they look precious?

Just use a little bit of that stuff, hon. It has to last a while.

Uh, sweetie, your friends wanted to have a "talk" with you.

Oh wait, wait.  You've got a little eye booger, hon.

Tsst.

Well, I certainly won't buy him anymore, then... Bill. 

Oh my goodness, it's a fire. 

Eric, I'm working two jobs. Mommy's doing everything she can.

What's that, my little man?

Please, leave my boy alone!

Oh. Eric, poopie, sit down.  Mommy has something to tell you. It's just that- well, there is no tooth fairy, Eric. I've been putting all that money under your pillow, and because you got so many teeth fall out, I've actually run out of money and can't go to the grocery store for at least a month.

Thanks for coming, everybody.

That's right, you did it, Poopsiekins!

What do you say, champ? Think you can tough it out?

Hi, Howard.

Boopie-kins.  It's time to stop preaching damnation to everyone, sweetie. 

Uh huuuh.

Eric, where have you been? It's ten thirty.

It's true.

Well, I don't know, Eric. If you did that, then the floors would be bare.

Eric, did you say 'hi' to your little cousin Elvin?

Well, I'm letting Eric go to the camp. I mean, it seems to me this Chinpokomon thing is just another harmless fad.

Please, call me Liane.

Mee too.

It's going to be okay, baby. We're going to get you more time.

Hehh, it doesn't look like our protest is working.

It's time for school

What do you mean?

Yyeess??  Well, what's your question, hon?

He's looking a little better today.

Yes, Eric

Boys, you have a little visitor. 

I think we need to get you a different brand, hon. They're a little cheaper.

Hello everyone. Happy Holidays!

Your friends and I have all chipped in and we're going to send you up to a weight-management retreat.

This year is gonna be different. Look!  I got you "Hooked On Monkey Fonics." 

What's that, hon?

Hello. Um, I would like to... sign my son up, please.

Oh my- Doctor!  He's awake! 

Yes. I'm afraid he's a little moody.

Here you go, sweetie.

Sweetie, let the nice firemen do their job.

Well, that's exactly what I intend to do. Good day! 

Uh, what exactly does that entail, doctor?

Are you sure, sweetie?

Then why did you go outside to a police officer and say "Help! Help! My mommy is trying to fuck me!"?

Twenty more minutes, and that's it. 

Hmmm. but you're not out of control, muffin. You're my perfect little gum drop.

Oh.

Ooo, he loves playing with his Clyde Frog and Wellington Bear.

Here you are, muffin. 

Tsst. 

Woooh! Whooppee!!  Unhh! 

Don't scratch it, hon.

Oh, but my poor little poopsie must be getting so hungry. Maybe we should get them a little food.

E-heric, it's only Halloween.

...Um, he's retarded. 

Eric, honey, what's the matter?

Happy Halloween!

Oh, hello boys. Have you seen Eric around anywhere?

Oooo, looks like the tooth fairy was extra-happy with youuu. 

You can have an eensy weensy bit, can't you?

Isn't that funny, sweetie?

Oh, that's great, sweetie.

And sometimes the man puts his who-who-dilly in the woman's cha-cha. 

Oh, Eric, it's just part of being a child.

Thank you so much for babysitting little Eric, Shelly.

Who are you talking to, muffin?

A million dollars?

Can't it wait till tomorrow, hon?

Eric, we can't afford that one.

We've learned to overcome it, son. You'll see.

Now you be careful, Eric. The woods can be very dangerous.

Eric, snookums! it's time for Mommy to tuck you into your snuggleboat for night-night.  Eric, are you out there in your clubhouse?

Ooohh, hhmmm . Wwell - yyou see, Eric, sometimes when a man and a woman are... attracted to each other , they want to be... close to each other.

You have to see the eye doctor, Eric.

Oh yes, Sharon. How are you?

Oh, he's amazing. I think the change in personality happened. He's doing things for himself now, and he seems to be accepting it. I've lost a best friend, but I've gained a son.

In his room. But, why don't I show you the rest of the house first? 

Stinky apples. See you, boys. 

Sure, hon.

All right, are you little munchkins buckled up for safety?

Sweetie, your friends are downstairs. They need to see you.

I love you very much, poopsiekins. You're Mommy's sunshine. 

That's nice, muffin.

Well, I've got an idea. We could sing.

It's a new way to learn how to read and spell. And it comes with everything you need to help win that spelling bee.  It says we just put the cassette into a tape player 

That's very naughty, Eric.

No, it will be fine. How about I make you some hot tea with lemon and codeine?

Oh, what a party that was!  Hmm-hm-hm-hmm. Hmm-hm-hm-hmm. 

Eric, sweetie, there's a bunch of people showing up in our backyard saying something about a meeting?

Come give Mommy Eskimo kisses! 

Hello?

Hon, are you ready for some math problems?

You too, Eric.

Not yet hon.

Sure, hon. 

What happened, Eric?

Ohoho poopsiekins, be nice.

I know that the NSA is torturing Santa, sweetie. But they're keeping us safe.

Why?? What's wrong with him??

Stop crying, Eric! I told you if you kept acting up, you weren't getting anything!

About a hundred and twelve.

And don't get too close to Kyle. He looks like he might have the AIDS. 

Tsst.

Scuzzlebutt saved the day.

Oooh, what should I do? I'm playing roulette with my child's life!  Ooo wait, Hairspray is showing in New York, isn't it? Let's go there.

Is he going to be okay?

I heard an explosion.

Really?

Eric? Poopsiekins?  Eric?  Honey, maybe that's enough computer time. It's been about nineteen hours now.  I know you said not to disturb you with your new toy, but Mommy thought maybe you needed to eat?  All right, I'll just leave it here, hon.  I'm turning in for the night. Mommy loves you.

Ahah, I'm plastered! 

Yes, sweetie?

Oh, dear.

Oh my.

Oh I never saw him after that. Ah-I wasn't really that interested in him.

Oh, a- a- all right, sweetie, I- I'll take you tomorrow.

Eric, we're almost to Frisco. Why don't we go to the Church's Fried Chicken there?

Oh, that sounds fine. I'm going to a meteor shower party. The number where I'll be is on the refrigerator. Eric's nookie time is 9 o'clock sharp. If his little woogums get cold, you can turn up the heat over here. And if he gets cranky, just play tummy-rub-rubs with him, and make sure he wipes good after he makes bears.

Sweetie, Bill Gates is on the phone for you.

Hang in there, sweetie. We'll be there soon.

But who would want to s-

Look what I did, Eric. I learned how to make Sumie paintings. I had almost forgotten how artistic I was.

No, sweetie, the Chinese aren't going to get you.

Oh, goodness! What's going on?

You are, hon, but... I don't think that's a very good idea. 

I love you, sweetie.

Oh, that's very interesting.

Oh, Chief. I want your hot man chowder.

Cesar. I'm so happy you're back.
