More pie, hon?

Come on, Eric. Let's try to battle your Roostor with my Donkeytron.

In a minute, sweetie. This is important.

Mommy's busy, boopie-kins.

Oh, goodness! What's going on?

Eric, Sister Anne has come to visit you.

And don't get too close to Kyle. He looks like he might have the AIDS. 

He said he's hungry. What should I do?

Well, that's exactly what I intend to do. Good day! 

Well, I don't know, Eric. If you did that, then the floors would be bare.

What happened, Eric?

And I know it can get scary up in those woods, but just remember, mommy's not far away. 

You give your mommy a kissy.

Just use a little bit of that stuff, hon. It has to last a while.

Eight years old.

What is the picture of, Eric? 

Uhoh, Thanksgiving's still a couple of weeks away, sweetie. I haven't gone shoppies yet.

Bye, kids. 

I heard he still lives on the Ute reservation just outside of town.

Tsst. 

Well, what does he need?

We've learned to overcome it, son. You'll see.

Isn't that funny, sweetie?

Oh, that's so nice.

Oh, my poor little baby!

Thank you.  Don't pick your nose, hon.

Oh God!  Oh no!

No, you don't have to fly to Russia, hon.

Oh, he's been amazing, Cesar. He got an A on his last spelling test and a B+ in history. He's losing weight and he's doing what I tell him.

...Um, he's retarded. 

What?

Eric, poopsie?

Oh my! She must think that you are a very special little muffin.

Over the meadow and through the woods

Sounds divine!

Oh. Well,  alrighty then.

I am the pack leader! 

It's almost bedtime. If you sleep then time'll go by faster.

Squeaker! 

Tsst.

Why Eric, you made your own breakfast.

Well, then, now you should take that money and open up a savings account that has compounded daily interest.

Wait. Wait.  Who is that?  Chief... could you excuse me for a minute?

This says it does everything the iPad does, at half the price.

Now Eric, this has gone far enough!  You need to learn to be patient!

Here, I made you powdered donut pancake surprise.

Oh, I'm so glad to hear it, Mrs. Stotch. Eric has been having some emotional problems lately.

Eric, you wanna say hi to Grandpa?

Oh, sweetie, those were all lies. You're just fat. 

Don't worry, sweetie, everything is fine.

I think we need to get you a different brand, hon. They're a little cheaper.

Ohhh...

Oh! And don't mind the cat. She's just being loud because she's in heat.

Eric, I got you a new history textbook. Why don't you come downstairs.

Oo, poopiekins?

I have to leave soon, Eric.

Oh, thank you so much for coming. Please come in. 

Sweetie, shhh, tell Mommy what happened.

I guess it's much better to get it when you're young.

O-oh, thank you. Freebie next week. 

Eric, I promise you, I didn't do anything to your favorite toy. Whoever did this to you, I hate them as much as you do, and I'd do anything to get to the bottom of it.

Oh, what is it this time? 

Tsst.

You mean...

Eric, you come home, right now!

Oohh, you look great, hon. Mommy's fat little piggy.

No, hon.

Sweetie, let the nice firemen do their job.

About eight years ago.

Yes, it's true.

Eric, snookums! it's time for Mommy to tuck you into your snuggleboat for night-night.  Eric, are you out there in your clubhouse?

Oh. Well, I'll tell Eric. He's just down in the basement playing with his dolls. 

What's that, Eric?

Tsst.

Sure, hon. 

Eric, this is for the best.

It's okay, Eric. I'll have a talk with Kyle's mother.

Well, it's my son. He's lost a lot of his baby teeth, and I was starting to get worried.

It'll make your itches go away. 

I... don't think it worked.

There you are, Eric. What are you doing here?

But Eric, I think maybe the tooth fairy wants you to use that money to learn about saving.

Boys, you have a little visitor. 

Uh, sweetie, your friends wanted to have a "talk" with you.

No, sweetie, the Chinese aren't going to get you.

You have to see the eye doctor, Eric.

It's the most wonderful time of the year
do do do do do do do do-

I'm so proud of you, Eric.

Don't say "tits," Eric.

Wow, I have a lot to learn.

Yyeess??  Well, what's your question, hon?

Eric, you're just going to have to be patient. 

Now, Eric, let's try to get out of that grumpy mood before we get to Grandma's.
Over the meadow and through the woods

Oh, hello boys.

I did it! 

Sweetie, your friends are downstairs. They need to see you.

Oh, why yes he did. I thought you were dead, Sharon.

What do you mean?

Oh, what is it?

Do you see that, Sheila? The Williamses are shopping here.

Oooohh, Chef! Woooo, Chef!

Oh, it's my pleasure. Eric loves his little friends.

There's just one problem: he still fights me every step of the way. I feel like he's doing what I tell him, but that inside he's still the same angry spoiled child.

What is it, snookums?

Twenty more minutes, and that's it. 

Then why did you go outside to a police officer and say "Help! Help! My mommy is trying to fuck me!"?

Eric dear? I just got a call from your friend Kyle's mother. She said that this show is naughty, and might make you a potty mouth.

Tsst. 

I'm back, hon. I got some more calamine lotion. 

Hon, are you ready for some math problems?

Oh, I mean, sex and drugs.

Hello?

Not yet hon.

Not too much, hon. It says on the bottle that too much can be bad.

What's that, my little man?

All those other babysitters won't come back.

Well, go right ahead, Officer Barbrady.

Ah, no, these people claim that they are the "real" psychic detectives. 

Uh sweetie, I see that you're a little... disturbed right now, but, maybe you can-

Eric, it's important for you to understand-.

Where have you been, young man?!

Why?? What's wrong with him??

Thank you so much for babysitting little Eric, Shelly.

Whoa. Easy, Kyle.

Oh, you're sounding just like your old self again.

Is he going to be all right, doctor??

Yes, hon? 

Cesar. I'm so happy you're back.

Okay, hon.

Ohoho, nhn.

Don't pick your nose, hon.

Eric honey, time to get up for school. 

Oh, that sounds fine. I'm going to a meteor shower party. The number where I'll be is on the refrigerator. Eric's nookie time is 9 o'clock sharp. If his little woogums get cold, you can turn up the heat over here. And if he gets cranky, just play tummy-rub-rubs with him, and make sure he wipes good after he makes bears.

Oh wait, wait.  You've got a little eye booger, hon.

Orf course I do.

Mmmm-my, how exciting. Would you care to... put your tongue in my mouth?

Good night.  What do you have there, Eric?

Sweetiekins, are you all right?

I know. I know he's out of control. But... you don't know what it's like.  I'm sorry. It's just that... he seems to get worse every day.  He just never listens.

How's the treehouse coming along, hon?

...And so you see, Congressman O'Reilly, that's why I think abortion laws should be changed.

What?

Ooo, careful hon. These roads are bumpy.

Is it over? 

...I'm sorry, Eric. The answer is No. 

What?

That shouldn't be a problem. Eric's Grandma is right near the mall.

Stop crying, Eric! I told you if you kept acting up, you weren't getting anything!

Oh, Chief. I want your hot man chowder.

No, honey, Mommy's gotta save her throat. I have to work tonight.

Eric? Sweetie, are you having nightmares about the Chinese again?

He's looking a little better today.

Well, I'm letting Eric go to the camp. I mean, it seems to me this Chinpokomon thing is just another harmless fad.

Eric, your little friends are here.

Yes. I think it's the nanny, boopsiekins.

It's going to be okay, baby. We're going to get you more time.

Believe it. He lost 40 pounds at his fat camp. 

Ooh, I'm sorry to hear that, Stanley.

Oh, I should tell my son the truth about everything myself. Good day, Mr. President. 

You're the best, Cesar, and to show my gratitude I've got two tickets for you and me to see Madame Butterfly this Friday night.

Mmmm.

About another hour, hon.

Oh, but my poor little poopsie must be getting so hungry. Maybe we should get them a little food.

Uh huuuh.

He's never done this before.

Don't apologize to us, apologize to him!

Oooh, what should I do? I'm playing roulette with my child's life!  Ooo wait, Hairspray is showing in New York, isn't it? Let's go there.

Oh my God! Eric! Eric,  Mommy's here. Sweetie?  Oh, what's wrong with him?

Ooo, he loves playing with his Clyde Frog and Wellington Bear.

Look what I did, Eric. I learned how to make Sumie paintings. I had almost forgotten how artistic I was.

Come on. Do you want your laser corrective surgery or not?

Eric, where have you been? It's ten thirty.

Hello, kiddies. I made you all powdered doughnut pancake surprise.

Cartman. Yesuh- it's such a hard decision, but I just don't feel I can raise a child in this screwy world.

Oh. Well. Would you like some beetles for breakfast? 

Oh my.

Oh. Eric, poopie, sit down.  Mommy has something to tell you. It's just that- well, there is no tooth fairy, Eric. I've been putting all that money under your pillow, and because you got so many teeth fall out, I've actually run out of money and can't go to the grocery store for at least a month.

Please, call me Liane.

Eric, don't you realize you could've seriously injured your little friend?

Yes, but they said two weeks off was enough, and they want everyone back.

Yeah, it's best to avoid his level.

Well, what if I took you to Kentucky Fried Chicken afterward?  And then we'll go to Target and buy you a Mega Ranger.

You can have an eensy weensy bit, can't you?

Uh, what exactly does that entail, doctor?

Oh well, no TV for him for a few days.

Safety belt?

Oh, that's not funny, boys. Eric isn't fat, his big-boned.

Ooooh, he's just been feeling under the weather. Maybe you boys can cheer him up. He's in the backyard.

No, sweetie, I've been at the hair salon. Why?

Oooh, I'm gonna decorate the house for Halloween,
with scary ghosts and bats and creepy crawly things...
Hello there!

Here, look at this one. A Toshiba Handibook.

No no no, that's impossible, hon. I told her: no visitors.

Sorry, hon.

That's a great idea, Chef.

Eric, calm down. 

Come give Mommy Eskimo kisses! 

Eric.  The babysitter's here. Come on downstairs.

I heard an explosion.

Oh. Eh-hello, Dr. Roberts? It's Ms. Cartman.

Hu-old on, dear, let me check.  Hon, I made beefy logs.  I made Cookie Dings.  No, he's not here.

Come this way, Billy. 

Ahah, I'm plastered! 

Come on, kiddies. Eat more.

Eric, you have to come home. You can't just wait here for that game to come out.

That's right, you did it, Poopsiekins!

I made some healthy tofu pudding to celebrate. Who wants some?

I DON'T!

Are you sure this is what you want, sweetie?

Sure, hon.

That's nice, poopie. 

What, hon?

It's too far and your parents want you back home.

Oh dear. I don't know what else to do about my son's behavioral problems. We've been through every nanny reality show on television.

Eric, why would you do such a thing?

These are Eric's friends: Stan, Kyle, and Kenny. Boys, let me introduce you to the Cartman family. This is Uncle Stinky.

The what?

Oh, all right.

Yes.

Well, all right.

...And it has basketball courts and tennis courts, and you can call Mommy any time you want.  Oh, sweetie-kins, don't be mad. I'm sure you're going to have a good time. And when you come back you'll be all healthy and thin. 

Oh ye-yes, of course,sweetie.

Oh, what a party that was!  Hmm-hm-hm-hmm. Hmm-hm-hm-hmm. 

What what is it that you're doing?

How are you doing?

Be careful with my baby.

Well, we're in a tough economy, Eric. I don't know what else you want me to do about it.

Hello, Eric.

Oh, a- a- all right, sweetie, I- I'll take you tomorrow.

Nnno, I got you something that's going to help you win the big spelling bee tomorrow.

Well, then. I know a certain kitty-kitty who's sleeping with Mommy tonight.

Eric, I talked to you about beating up your friends, didn't I?

I'm glad you're not that bad, poopsie-kins

Oh, baby, your time is back!

Oh, he's such a cutie.

Tsst. 

Oh... Oh my gosh!

Ohho, Carol, where are the Porto-Potties?

Oh, Eric, it's just part of being a child.

Eric?  It must be his time. I think it's running out!

Eric, you do not beat up your friends! And I told you I've had it with your language!  Your punishment is that your friends will just play superheroes without you! Go to your room!

Ssshhh, pumpkin, it's almost over.

No!

Eric, you have a little visitor. Is that all right? 

You're not fat, you're big-boned.

No- Eric, stay in the car, sweetie!

Here, I got you some calamine lotion. 

You have?

Oh.

Oh, very good, sweetie.

Oh no uh- I didn't mean that. I meant the other thing you can do-what's that other A word?

Oh, you've been so helpful, I uh, just don't know how to thank you.

Oh dear.

Hello. Um, I would like to... sign my son up, please.

Eric? What's the, what's the matter? 

Eric, naughty.

Ooh, I have them somewhere else, boopiekins.

Tsst.

Hello, Sheila? It's Liane, Eric's mother.

Oh.  Well, goodbye, sweetie.

Come on, Chef! Haven't you ever heard of a manage o'three?

I was young and naive then... 

Hi, Howard.

I love you, sweetie.

There you are, Eric.

Be good.

Well, why don't you get ready for snoogums' night-night, and I'll bring you some toasty chocolate nummers?

Oh, that's so sweet. Oh, I love you too, poopiekins! 

You have nothing to worry about in school tomorrow. Mrs. Broflovski assured me that Kyle doesn't have the picture.

Poopsiekins, wake up. Wake up, honey.

No, sweetie, we have to tend to some of Grandma's business.

There you are, Eric! Come on, we have to go to the eye doctor.

But, honey, it's only September. That...  Nintendo Wii doesn't come out for two months.

And sometimes the man puts his who-who-dilly in the woman's cha-cha. 

And then I saw him. He was the most beautiful, charming piece of ass I'd ever seen in South Park. His name... was Chief Running Water.  I don't recall exactly how the rest of the night went, but the next morning I was pregnant with you, my little blueberry muffin.

Eric!

Oooo, looks like the tooth fairy was extra-happy with youuu. 

Now, hon.

Yes, Eric

Well, he's just... out of control. I mean, he never listens to me, and he pretty much runs my life.

Bad, Eric, bad! 

But what if he does run away.

Got it. 

Oh, but we really need some help. 

No, it will be fine. How about I make you some hot tea with lemon and codeine?

Eric, look who's here.

They're so strange. Where are they from?

Eric, Mommy got you a present!

Oh... But I thought we were becoming friends.

I love you very much, poopsiekins. You're Mommy's sunshine. 

Not really, hon.  Mom has to go now! I'll be home in about an hour!  Oh! Oh, Mr. Mackey!

Sure, hon. You want some Cheesy Poofs, too?

This year is gonna be different. Look!  I got you "Hooked On Monkey Fonics." 

They say it's an emergency.

Here we go, kids. We're crossing the state line into Nebraska. 

Oh, dear.

Oh my God! Eric!

Now, hon!

Well, no, I don't.

This party is very loud, boopy-kins. You'll have to speak up.

That's my little boy. 

Don't be difficult, Eric! Now, you go out and play in the fun snow.

My little sunshine has a temper sometimes, but he's not all bad.

Oh, well, I'm not sure. Actually, Eric is still supposed to be grounded for trying to exterminate the Jews two weeks ago.

It's true.

Yess, that's what I mean. Adoption.

Ohhh, oh. I'm not sure.  Sweetie, what is your condition?

Oh, Poopie-kins, it's very early.

You have been bad, so you're gonna have to drink from this glass. 

Wheat. The building block of your favorite foods, and, Nebraska's principal source of economic productivity. You see, when Nebraska first became--

Oh... 

Here we are. 

Eric, did you say 'hi' to your little cousin Elvin?

Right, because it will hybrid with all those other processors and generate a whole new era of technological darkness.

Oh dear... I was checking out the Internet and ih, it almost seems like his symptoms are like those in something called "Tour, Tourette's Syndrome"?

Eric, I'm working two jobs. Mommy's doing everything she can.

Oh, my. The tooth fairy will have to give you a big surprise for losing two teeth in two days.

Eric Cartman!

Oh, yes. When I was a child, my mother had me go over to a little girl's house who had the chickenpox, just so I would get it.

The KFC in Salida is a long way away, sweetie. Be patient.

It started about four days ago, Doctor, and every day he seems to get worse.

Aww, what happened, hun?

Well, I think you need to keep your laws off of my body.

I asked little Eric where he would feel safest, and he said with his friend Token.

Sweetie, Bill Gates is on the phone for you.

What hon?

Oh yes, Sharon. How are you?

I know that the NSA is torturing Santa, sweetie. But they're keeping us safe.

Eskimo kisses for Mom-my!

Oh, I'm sorry, but I really don't think I can afford this.

Sweetie, there's a Mr. Pun Li Tsiao on the phone for you?

Oh, he's amazing. I think the change in personality happened. He's doing things for himself now, and he seems to be accepting it. I've lost a best friend, but I've gained a son.

Here, Kyle. Will you hold Great-Grandma's catheter bag during dinner? 

Oh, all right. 

Eric, sweetie, is everything okay?

No please!

Eric, sweetie, there's a bunch of people showing up in our backyard saying something about a meeting?

Eric, we can't afford that one.

Yes, sweetie?

Ah-are you okay, hon?

Oh... N- no, sweetie. I believe those Olympics are just for... "special" children.

I just, I- I'm gonna go make you kids some lemonade. 

Yes hon?

Terminated?

Honey, it's okay.

Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah!

What's that, hon?

Hmmm. 

Come down as soon as you're done. 

Eric, stop acting like a spoiled brat! You can either have the Toshiba Handibook or you can have nothing at all!

And you're studying before school?

Eric, I want you to go upstairs and brush your teeth. Then I'll be up to read you a story before bed.  Oh my goodness. I can't believe it.

Sweetie, can't we go after school?

He's an imspration to us all.

You're going to be okay, baby.

Oh, hello boys. Have you seen Eric around anywhere?

Yes, hon?

Hang in there, sweetie. We'll be there soon.

Ohhh, okay hon.

Hello?

Oh, no. Quite the contrary. Eric showed up and surprised me last night. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to present to you... the new Eric Cartman. 

Well, Sheila, we can't shelter our boys forever from these things. Maybe it's okay for them to see an adult film.

Yes, darling. You can have whatever you want. 

If you're really sorry, then you'll understand why you aren't getting anything!

Hehh, it doesn't look like our protest is working.

Hi, sweetie.

Hi, kids. I'm home.

Sweetie.

Mr. Pharmacist, this Ritalin doesn't have any side effects, does it?

Be sure to use lots of bug spray, and if you have to poo-poo, don't wipe with poison ivy. 

Oh...

What's the matter, sweetie?

Hello, boys.

Eric, you've done a lot of horrible things in your life, but smoking? You're grounded for three weeks!

Don't pick your nose, hon.

Eric, what have we talked about with that language?! One more time and I'm not taking you anywhere!

Hello everyone. Happy Holidays!

Oh. Ah, I'm white trash and I'm in trouble.

Oh my- Doctor!  He's awake! 

Eric! Eric, wait!

Eric, stop it!

Don't scratch it, hon.

You are, hon, but... I don't think that's a very good idea. 

That's very naughty, Eric.

Eric, honey, what's the matter?

It's a new way to learn how to read and spell. And it comes with everything you need to help win that spelling bee.  It says we just put the cassette into a tape player 

Well, I've got an idea. We could sing.

Thank you so much for allowing Eric and I to stay here.

E-heric, it's only Halloween.

Oh, here's the doctors now! Hi, doctor.

Oh Eric, I'm so happy you're home.

Excuse me, shouldn't we wait for everyone to arrive before we get started?

She said she was sure, Eric.

You all right, sweetie?

Don't you see, Governor? I should have a right to have an abortion if I want one.

Great-grandma has a bladder problem. This helps her out.

Oh, don't they look precious?

Eric, sshhhh. 

I'm sorry I never told you, Eric.  I just thought, maybe it would be a little shocking to you.

Eric? Poopsiekins?  Eric?  Honey, maybe that's enough computer time. It's been about nineteen hours now.  I know you said not to disturb you with your new toy, but Mommy thought maybe you needed to eat?  All right, I'll just leave it here, hon.  I'm turning in for the night. Mommy loves you.

Oohh, honey, why don't you make it yourself?  Mommy's  expecting  some company.

Well, Eric, there's nothing more I can do about it.

His new... powers?

Ohh, that's nice.

Ooohh, hhmmm . Wwell - yyou see, Eric, sometimes when a man and a woman are... attracted to each other , they want to be... close to each other.

Oh my goodness, I had no idea.  Are you okay, sweetie?

Doctor! Did you find out what's wrong with him?

Oooh, I'll go make some tea.

Right away, hon. 

Okay.

Really?

Eric, are you listening to me?!

Mee too.

Come on, sweetie. Doctor says you need to get home and get lots of rest.

Oh Doctor, can you help him?

Here you go, sweetie.

Oh, sweetie, $900?

Yes hon?

Please, come in.

Cesar...

Here you are, muffin. 

Whoa!

Um, Sheila, I'm sorry to trouble you with this, but apparently your son has a picture of Eric with another boy's penis in his mouth.

Oh it's so good to have you acting like yourself again, sweetie.

Oh, hello sweetie. What did you do today?

Oh, there there, sweetie. It'll be okay. These things happen.

Boopie-kins.  It's time to stop preaching damnation to everyone, sweetie. 

Oh no, thank you so much for your time. 

Yes they are, but you were supposed to be grounded in your room! And now you're more grounded, young man!

You're not fat, you're big boned.

Oh, you've finally come back! It's a miracle!

I'll think about it, hon.

Oh, oh, my baby has HIV!

Please, leave my boy alone!

Oh, thank you, thank you.

Oh dear.

...What!?

When does it come out?

It's the Toilet Safety Administration, hun. They're gonna do something to the potty.

What do you mean "what should-"

All, all right dear. 

Yes. Apples.  Ahapples, get it? 

Ahall right.

I'm making you some lunch right now, Eric.

Hmmm. but you're not out of control, muffin. You're my perfect little gum drop.

Oh my goodness, what's going on?

Eric, please. We have to do some studying today.

What is it, hon?

What's going on?

Oh, but I thought your teacher died.

Scuzzlebutt saved the day.

But who would want to s-

About a hundred and twelve.

Sweetie, don't.

No, honey. It's just-

I mean, what right do I have bringing another child into this overpopulated world? Then again, I should've thought of that before having sex. then againuh-- Oh, I just don't know...

In his room. But, why don't I show you the rest of the house first? 

Well, what's a nice, handsome, black  man like yourself doing in a pit like South Park?

Hello, everybody.  Now, just do it like we rehearsed, hon.

Oh, Eric dear. It's what's best.

What can we do?

Poopsiekins!  Sweetie, what is the-  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!

Aunt Lisa, Cousin Fred, Cousin Alexandra , Fat Bob, Jimmy , and great-grandma Florence. 

You have to get ready for school

Oh, dear!

It doesn't seem to work as well when I do it.

Alright! let's go. 

Yes, Mysterion?

Is there a problem, sweetie?

Oh dear.
Dr. Doctor:
But I'm more concerned about his state of mind. Your son appears to be completely insane.

Yes. I'm afraid he's a little moody.

Oh, heck. I haven't even started yet. He-he.  I baked cookiees; would anybody like one?! 

You're doing so much better, muffin.

Eric, we aren't that much poorer than most people.

Oh I never saw him after that. Ah-I wasn't really that interested in him.

Oh my goodness.

Oh, all right. I was just at the store buying some apples.

But the person at Unplanned Parenthood said you were who I had to talk to about changing the law.

It's time for school

Around six hours.

Is he going to be okay?

Get it down.

Eric, we're almost to Frisco. Why don't we go to the Church's Fried Chicken there?

Woooh! Whooppee!!  Unhh! 

I want to have... an abortion.

Sweetie, you really can just talk to me if you-

Stinky apples. See you, boys. 

Okay, hon.

It's not him, it's you, Eric.  I don't know what to do with you.

No, no, Florence, that's not Eric.

Ohoho poopsiekins, be nice.

Well you should've called Mommy.

My little Eric can sometimes be a bit... dramatic. 

Oh, but I suppose it would be good for him. Yes, of course he can go. I'll bring some of clothes over.

Oh dear.

Oh, that's great, sweetie.

Oh, Eric. I'm very proud of you.

Everything okay, sweetie?

Thanks for coming, everybody.

Oh, he will. My little poopsiekins is a very good little boy.

Oh, now why would he do that?

You made me look like some sort of child molester in front of all those people!

O-o-o-o-oh! 

Oh, oh, my goodness no. I haven't used drugs in quite a while.

Oh, I just can't stand to see my baby suffer

That's nice, muffin.

Ooh, sweetums, did you laugh too hard again?

Alright.

Why hello there. I don't think I've seen you around before. 

I'm sorry, Eric. All children find out sooner or later.

Oh, my little poopsie-kins gets into no-nos once in a while, but he's still my perfect little plumsy-kiddle

All right, are you little munchkins buckled up for safety?

I know you're in a very dark place now, sweetie. But you must come toward the light! Come toward the light!

He's nine.

The best part is I'm not letting him boss me around anymore. I could have never come out and have a nice lunch on a Saturday afternoon with a friend before.

I thought you got it.

Well, some more of your little friends are here to play with you. 

Oohh, that's a big boy, isn't he? 

Eric, you're coming home right now!

How about a nice chocolate chicken pot pie, then?

Eric, get out of there. 

What's going on?

Stanley told me you had passed on. I'm glad to see that you're better.

Okay, muffin. Mommy's leaving now. You do what the babysitter tells you, okay?

Who are you talking to, muffin?
