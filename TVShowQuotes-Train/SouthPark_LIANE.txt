I made some healthy tofu pudding to celebrate. Who wants some?
Oh, you've finally come back! It's a miracle!
That shouldn't be a problem. Eric's Grandma is right near the mall.
Eric, don't you realize you could've seriously injured your little friend?
Oohh, honey, why don't you make it yourself?  Mommy's  expecting  some company.
Oh, there there, sweetie. It'll be okay. These things happen.
Oh, you're sounding just like your old self again.
Sweetie, you really can just talk to me if you-
Oh no uh- I didn't mean that. I meant the other thing you can do-what's that other A word?
It's the most wonderful time of the year
do do do do do do do do-
How about a nice chocolate chicken pot pie, then?
There you are, Eric. What are you doing here?
Look what I did, Eric. I learned how to make Sumie paintings. I had almost forgotten how artistic I was.
Well, I certainly won't buy him anymore, then... Bill. 
Eric? Sweetie, are you having nightmares about the Chinese again?
Well, we're in a tough economy, Eric. I don't know what else you want me to do about it.
Oh my goodness, I had no idea.  Are you okay, sweetie?
I know that the NSA is torturing Santa, sweetie. But they're keeping us safe.
Wheat. The building block of your favorite foods, and, Nebraska's principal source of economic productivity. You see, when Nebraska first became--
Oh, I just can't stand to see my baby suffer
Oh, well, I'm not sure. Actually, Eric is still supposed to be grounded for trying to exterminate the Jews two weeks ago.
Oh. Well, I'll tell Eric. He's just down in the basement playing with his dolls. 
Eric, you have a little visitor. Is that all right? 
Hehh, it doesn't look like our protest is working.
Oh, it's my pleasure. Eric loves his little friends.
Eric, you have to come home. You can't just wait here for that game to come out.
Are you sure this is what you want, sweetie?
Great-grandma has a bladder problem. This helps her out.
Well, what's a nice, handsome, black  man like yourself doing in a pit like South Park?
Oh, Eric, it's just part of being a child.
Oh, heck. I haven't even started yet. He-he.  I baked cookiees; would anybody like one?! 
No, you don't have to fly to Russia, hon.
Ohh, it's a little late, sweetie. Why don't you boys just keep playing downstairs?
Stanley told me you had passed on. I'm glad to see that you're better.
You can have an eensy weensy bit, can't you?
Oh, hello boys. Have you seen Eric around anywhere?
Okay, muffin. Mommy's leaving now. You do what the babysitter tells you, okay?
Come on, sweetie. Doctor says you need to get home and get lots of rest.
Sweetie, let the nice firemen do their job.
I asked little Eric where he would feel safest, and he said with his friend Token.
Oh, sweetie, those were all lies. You're just fat. 
Eric, you're just going to have to be patient. 
Eric, where have you been? It's ten thirty.
Yes. Fifteen of them in one night. Perhaps he should switch toothpaste?
Eric, sweetie, there's a bunch of people showing up in our backyard saying something about a meeting?
Oh, but I suppose it would be good for him. Yes, of course he can go. I'll bring some of clothes over.
Eric, did you say 'hi' to your little cousin Elvin?
Oooo, looks like the tooth fairy was extra-happy with youuu. 
No, sweetie, the Chinese aren't going to get you.
My little Eric can sometimes be a bit... dramatic. 
The best part is I'm not letting him boss me around anymore. I could have never come out and have a nice lunch on a Saturday afternoon with a friend before.
Sure, hon. You want some Cheesy Poofs, too?
Ah, no, these people claim that they are the "real" psychic detectives. 
...And it has basketball courts and tennis courts, and you can call Mommy any time you want.  Oh, sweetie-kins, don't be mad. I'm sure you're going to have a good time. And when you come back you'll be all healthy and thin. 
Oh. Ah, I'm white trash and I'm in trouble.
Oh I never saw him after that. Ah-I wasn't really that interested in him.
Well, why don't you get ready for snoogums' night-night, and I'll bring you some toasty chocolate nummers?
Eric?  It must be his time. I think it's running out!
I'm sorry I never told you, Eric.  I just thought, maybe it would be a little shocking to you.
Sweetie, Bill Gates is on the phone for you.
Uh sweetie, I see that you're a little... disturbed right now, but, maybe you can-
Eric, we aren't that much poorer than most people.
Oh, I'm sorry, but I really don't think I can afford this.
Well, I've got an idea. We could sing.
Stop crying, Eric! I told you if you kept acting up, you weren't getting anything!
Oh Cesar, I'm so happy to have you in my life. 
Uhoh, Thanksgiving's still a couple of weeks away, sweetie. I haven't gone shoppies yet.
No, it will be fine. How about I make you some hot tea with lemon and codeine?
Do you see that, Sheila? The Williamses are shopping here.
Oh, he will. My little poopsiekins is a very good little boy.
In his room. But, why don't I show you the rest of the house first? 
Nnno, I got you something that's going to help you win the big spelling bee tomorrow.
You're the best, Cesar, and to show my gratitude I've got two tickets for you and me to see Madame Butterfly this Friday night.
Oh, I'm so glad to hear it, Mrs. Stotch. Eric has been having some emotional problems lately.
Aunt Lisa, Cousin Fred, Cousin Alexandra , Fat Bob, Jimmy , and great-grandma Florence. 
Oh it's so good to have you acting like yourself again, sweetie.
Don't you see, Governor? I should have a right to have an abortion if I want one.
Oooh, I'm gonna decorate the house for Halloween,
with scary ghosts and bats and creepy crawly things...
Hello there!
Eric, I promise you, I didn't do anything to your favorite toy. Whoever did this to you, I hate them as much as you do, and I'd do anything to get to the bottom of it.
You're very sweet. Thank you again. Come on, muffin. 
Yes, but they said two weeks off was enough, and they want everyone back.
You made me look like some sort of child molester in front of all those people!
You have to see the eye doctor, Eric.
Oh, my. The tooth fairy will have to give you a big surprise for losing two teeth in two days.
Eric, stop acting like a spoiled brat! You can either have the Toshiba Handibook or you can have nothing at all!
Not really, hon.  Mom has to go now! I'll be home in about an hour!  Oh! Oh, Mr. Mackey!
Well, then, now you should take that money and open up a savings account that has compounded daily interest.
This party is very loud, boopy-kins. You'll have to speak up.
Here we go, kids. We're crossing the state line into Nebraska. 
Here hon, I packed you some cheesy poofs and happy tarts.
Oh well, no TV for him for a few days.
Eric, the day I met your father it was like - magic! It was a beautiful autumn night when the aspen trees were turning, at the Twelfth Annual Drunken Barn Dance. 
Not too much, hon. It says on the bottle that too much can be bad.
Now, Eric, let's try to get out of that grumpy mood before we get to Grandma's.
Over the meadow and through the woods
Don't be difficult, Eric! Now, you go out and play in the fun snow.
Hang in there, sweetie. We'll be there soon.
Oh, I should tell my son the truth about everything myself. Good day, Mr. President. 
Well, what if I took you to Kentucky Fried Chicken afterward?  And then we'll go to Target and buy you a Mega Ranger.
Mmmm-my, how exciting. Would you care to... put your tongue in my mouth?
If you're really sorry, then you'll understand why you aren't getting anything!
Well, that's exactly what I intend to do. Good day! 
Oh, I've told him to respect people's property. What did he take?
Yes. Every time somebody gets a birthday present Eric gets one too.  Otherwise, he gets a little upset.
Oh... But I thought we were becoming friends.
Um, Sheila, I'm sorry to trouble you with this, but apparently your son has a picture of Eric with another boy's penis in his mouth.
Here, look at this one. A Toshiba Handibook.
Good night.  What do you have there, Eric?
It's a new way to learn how to read and spell. And it comes with everything you need to help win that spelling bee.  It says we just put the cassette into a tape player 
What do you say, champ? Think you can tough it out?
That's okay, Eric, I think you need to go spend time with your little friends.
It's not him, it's you, Eric.  I don't know what to do with you.
Your friends and I have all chipped in and we're going to send you up to a weight-management retreat.
Eric, what have we talked about with that language?! One more time and I'm not taking you anywhere!
Now you be careful, Eric. The woods can be very dangerous.
Eric, we're almost to Frisco. Why don't we go to the Church's Fried Chicken there?
No, honey, Mommy's gotta save her throat. I have to work tonight.
It started about four days ago, Doctor, and every day he seems to get worse.
Oh... N- no, sweetie. I believe those Olympics are just for... "special" children.
But Eric, I think maybe the tooth fairy wants you to use that money to learn about saving.
Just use a little bit of that stuff, hon. It has to last a while.
These are Eric's friends: Stan, Kyle, and Kenny. Boys, let me introduce you to the Cartman family. This is Uncle Stinky.
Yes, darling. You can have whatever you want. 
Now Eric, this has gone far enough!  You need to learn to be patient!
Well, Sheila, we can't shelter our boys forever from these things. Maybe it's okay for them to see an adult film.
Well, all right.  I guess I can get some groceries anyway. 
I'm sorry, Eric. All children find out sooner or later.
Oh no, thank you so much for your time. 
Eric, please. We have to do some studying today.
Oh, he's amazing. I think the change in personality happened. He's doing things for himself now, and he seems to be accepting it. I've lost a best friend, but I've gained a son.
Thank you so much for babysitting little Eric, Shelly.
Eric, snookums! it's time for Mommy to tuck you into your snuggleboat for night-night.  Eric, are you out there in your clubhouse?
Oh, that's not funny, boys. Eric isn't fat, his big-boned.
Eric, you've done a lot of horrible things in your life, but smoking? You're grounded for three weeks!
I'm back, hon. I got some more calamine lotion. 
I'm making you some lunch right now, Eric.
Believe it. He lost 40 pounds at his fat camp. 
Oh dear.
Dr. Doctor:
But I'm more concerned about his state of mind. Your son appears to be completely insane.
Oh, no. Quite the contrary. Eric showed up and surprised me last night. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to present to you... the new Eric Cartman. 
Well, Eric, there's nothing more I can do about it.
Hello. Um, I would like to... sign my son up, please.
All right, are you little munchkins buckled up for safety?
Oh, Chief. I want your hot man chowder.
You are, hon, but... I don't think that's a very good idea. 
No no no, that's impossible, hon. I told her: no visitors.
The KFC in Salida is a long way away, sweetie. Be patient.
It's almost bedtime. If you sleep then time'll go by faster.
Hello, everybody.  Now, just do it like we rehearsed, hon.
Hu-old on, dear, let me check.  Hon, I made beefy logs.  I made Cookie Dings.  No, he's not here.
It's okay, Eric. I'll have a talk with Kyle's mother.
Hmmm. but you're not out of control, muffin. You're my perfect little gum drop.
Excuse me, shouldn't we wait for everyone to arrive before we get started?
Well, then. I know a certain kitty-kitty who's sleeping with Mommy tonight.
No, sweetie, I've been at the hair salon. Why?
Eric, Sister Anne has come to visit you.
There's just one problem: he still fights me every step of the way. I feel like he's doing what I tell him, but that inside he's still the same angry spoiled child.
Eric, I'm working two jobs. Mommy's doing everything she can.
Oh dear... I was checking out the Internet and ih, it almost seems like his symptoms are like those in something called "Tour, Tourette's Syndrome"?
Tucky tucky time, it's the best time of the night.
Eric, sweetie, there's um, some people here to see you.
Well, some more of your little friends are here to play with you. 
And don't get too close to Kyle. He looks like he might have the AIDS. 
Eric, how would you like to go with me to see Madame Butterfly Friday night?
Oooh, what should I do? I'm playing roulette with my child's life!  Ooo wait, Hairspray is showing in New York, isn't it? Let's go there.
Mr. Pharmacist, this Ritalin doesn't have any side effects, does it?
Eric honey, time to get up for school. 
He said he's hungry. What should I do?
Sweetie, there's a Mr. Pun Li Tsiao on the phone for you?
Go ahead, snookums. It's probably one of your little friends.
I just, I- I'm gonna go make you kids some lemonade. 
Oh! And don't mind the cat. She's just being loud because she's in heat.
It's the Toilet Safety Administration, hun. They're gonna do something to the potty.
Oh, but my poor little poopsie must be getting so hungry. Maybe we should get them a little food.
Oh dear. I don't know what else to do about my son's behavioral problems. We've been through every nanny reality show on television.
Oh. Well. Would you like some beetles for breakfast? 
And I know it can get scary up in those woods, but just remember, mommy's not far away. 
You have been bad, so you're gonna have to drink from this glass. 
This year is gonna be different. Look!  I got you "Hooked On Monkey Fonics." 
Eric, if you don't want to eat then, why don't you go brush your teeth and go to bed?!
Well, it's my son. He's lost a lot of his baby teeth, and I was starting to get worried.
Oh my! She must think that you are a very special little muffin.
Oh, thank you so much for coming. Please come in. 
And sometimes the man puts his who-who-dilly in the woman's cha-cha. 
Oh, a- a- all right, sweetie, I- I'll take you tomorrow.
You have nothing to worry about in school tomorrow. Mrs. Broflovski assured me that Kyle doesn't have the picture.
Oh wait, wait.  You've got a little eye booger, hon.
She talked with her son and says he doesn't have it.
...And so you see, Congressman O'Reilly, that's why I think abortion laws should be changed.
Oh, you've been so helpful, I uh, just don't know how to thank you.
Cartman. Yesuh- it's such a hard decision, but I just don't feel I can raise a child in this screwy world.
Well, I think you need to keep your laws off of my body.
Ooooh, he's just been feeling under the weather. Maybe you boys can cheer him up. He's in the backyard.
Be sure to use lots of bug spray, and if you have to poo-poo, don't wipe with poison ivy. 
Here, Kyle. Will you hold Great-Grandma's catheter bag during dinner? 
We've learned to overcome it, son. You'll see.
Well, I'm letting Eric go to the camp. I mean, it seems to me this Chinpokomon thing is just another harmless fad.
My little sunshine has a temper sometimes, but he's not all bad.
Uh, sweetie, your friends wanted to have a "talk" with you.
Yes they are, but you were supposed to be grounded in your room! And now you're more grounded, young man!
I know you're in a very dark place now, sweetie. But you must come toward the light! Come toward the light!
It doesn't seem to work as well when I do it.
Eric, you do not beat up your friends! And I told you I've had it with your language!  Your punishment is that your friends will just play superheroes without you! Go to your room!
But, honey, it's only September. That...  Nintendo Wii doesn't come out for two months.
Come on, Chef! Haven't you ever heard of a manage o'three?
Boopie-kins.  It's time to stop preaching damnation to everyone, sweetie. 
Ooohh, hhmmm . Wwell - yyou see, Eric, sometimes when a man and a woman are... attracted to each other , they want to be... close to each other.
Come on, Eric. Let's try to battle your Roostor with my Donkeytron.
Sweetie, your friends are downstairs. They need to see you.
It's too far and your parents want you back home.
Right, because it will hybrid with all those other processors and generate a whole new era of technological darkness.
Come on. Do you want your laser corrective surgery or not?
Ooo, he loves playing with his Clyde Frog and Wellington Bear.
Oh, yes. When I was a child, my mother had me go over to a little girl's house who had the chickenpox, just so I would get it.
Oh, he's been amazing, Cesar. He got an A on his last spelling test and a B+ in history. He's losing weight and he's doing what I tell him.
Eric? Poopsiekins?  Eric?  Honey, maybe that's enough computer time. It's been about nineteen hours now.  I know you said not to disturb you with your new toy, but Mommy thought maybe you needed to eat?  All right, I'll just leave it here, hon.  I'm turning in for the night. Mommy loves you.
Hello, kiddies. I made you all powdered doughnut pancake surprise.
Oh, my little poopsie-kins gets into no-nos once in a while, but he's still my perfect little plumsy-kiddle
Is he going to be all right, doctor??
Doctor! Did you find out what's wrong with him?
Oh, oh, my goodness no. I haven't used drugs in quite a while.
I know. I know he's out of control. But... you don't know what it's like.  I'm sorry. It's just that... he seems to get worse every day.  He just never listens.
Well, I don't know, Eric. If you did that, then the floors would be bare.
I guess it's much better to get it when you're young.
But I just don't think I'm a fit mother.
There you are, Eric! Come on, we have to go to the eye doctor.
Wait. Wait.  Who is that?  Chief... could you excuse me for a minute?
But the person at Unplanned Parenthood said you were who I had to talk to about changing the law.
Eric dear? I just got a call from your friend Kyle's mother. She said that this show is naughty, and might make you a potty mouth.
Oohh, you look great, hon. Mommy's fat little piggy.
Hon, are you ready for some math problems?
Why hello there. I don't think I've seen you around before. 
Oh. Eric, poopie, sit down.  Mommy has something to tell you. It's just that- well, there is no tooth fairy, Eric. I've been putting all that money under your pillow, and because you got so many teeth fall out, I've actually run out of money and can't go to the grocery store for at least a month.
Ohhh, oh. I'm not sure.  Sweetie, what is your condition?
