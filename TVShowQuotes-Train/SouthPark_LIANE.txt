My little Eric can sometimes be a bit... dramatic. 
Oh! And don't mind the cat. She's just being loud because she's in heat.
No no no, that's impossible, hon. I told her: no visitors.
It's a new way to learn how to read and spell. And it comes with everything you need to help win that spelling bee.  It says we just put the cassette into a tape player 
We've learned to overcome it, son. You'll see.
Oohh, honey, why don't you make it yourself?  Mommy's  expecting  some company.
Eric honey, time to get up for school. 
Oh, oh, my goodness no. I haven't used drugs in quite a while.
You're the best, Cesar, and to show my gratitude I've got two tickets for you and me to see Madame Butterfly this Friday night.
But I just don't think I'm a fit mother.
Oh it's so good to have you acting like yourself again, sweetie.
Now Eric, this has gone far enough!  You need to learn to be patient!
Eric, the day I met your father it was like - magic! It was a beautiful autumn night when the aspen trees were turning, at the Twelfth Annual Drunken Barn Dance. 
Oh, that's not funny, boys. Eric isn't fat, his big-boned.
Okay, muffin. Mommy's leaving now. You do what the babysitter tells you, okay?
Ooo, he loves playing with his Clyde Frog and Wellington Bear.
Hello, kiddies. I made you all powdered doughnut pancake surprise.
Eric, if you don't want to eat then, why don't you go brush your teeth and go to bed?!
The KFC in Salida is a long way away, sweetie. Be patient.
You are, hon, but... I don't think that's a very good idea. 
Well, what if I took you to Kentucky Fried Chicken afterward?  And then we'll go to Target and buy you a Mega Ranger.
I know. I know he's out of control. But... you don't know what it's like.  I'm sorry. It's just that... he seems to get worse every day.  He just never listens.
No, sweetie, the Chinese aren't going to get you.
Eric, did you say 'hi' to your little cousin Elvin?
Eric, I want you to go upstairs and brush your teeth. Then I'll be up to read you a story before bed.  Oh my goodness. I can't believe it.
Yes, darling. You can have whatever you want. 
Oh, yes. When I was a child, my mother had me go over to a little girl's house who had the chickenpox, just so I would get it.
All right, are you little munchkins buckled up for safety?
Well, we're in a tough economy, Eric. I don't know what else you want me to do about it.
These are Eric's friends: Stan, Kyle, and Kenny. Boys, let me introduce you to the Cartman family. This is Uncle Stinky.
Do you see that, Sheila? The Williamses are shopping here.
Oh, there there, sweetie. It'll be okay. These things happen.
My little sunshine has a temper sometimes, but he's not all bad.
Cartman. Yesuh- it's such a hard decision, but I just don't feel I can raise a child in this screwy world.
Eric, you have to come home. You can't just wait here for that game to come out.
Eric, you do not beat up your friends! And I told you I've had it with your language!  Your punishment is that your friends will just play superheroes without you! Go to your room!
It doesn't seem to work as well when I do it.
No, sweetie, I've been at the hair salon. Why?
Now, Eric, let's try to get out of that grumpy mood before we get to Grandma's.
Over the meadow and through the woods
It's too far and your parents want you back home.
Believe it. He lost 40 pounds at his fat camp. 
Is he going to be all right, doctor??
Oh, Chief. I want your hot man chowder.
I know you're in a very dark place now, sweetie. But you must come toward the light! Come toward the light!
Sweetie, your friends are downstairs. They need to see you.
Oh, no. Quite the contrary. Eric showed up and surprised me last night. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to present to you... the new Eric Cartman. 
Eric, where have you been? It's ten thirty.
Ooh, sweetums, did you laugh too hard again?
There you are, Eric. What are you doing here?
This says it does everything the iPad does, at half the price.
Right, because it will hybrid with all those other processors and generate a whole new era of technological darkness.
Thank you so much for allowing Eric and I to stay here.
Boopsie-kins, It's late. You need to be in bed.
Eric, you're just going to have to be patient. 
Oh, I'm so glad to hear it, Mrs. Stotch. Eric has been having some emotional problems lately.
I love you very much, poopsiekins. You're Mommy's sunshine. 
I asked little Eric where he would feel safest, and he said with his friend Token.
Eric, sweetie, there's um, some people here to see you.
Stop crying, Eric! I told you if you kept acting up, you weren't getting anything!
Sweetie, let the nice firemen do their job.
...And so you see, Congressman O'Reilly, that's why I think abortion laws should be changed.
Oh no uh- I didn't mean that. I meant the other thing you can do-what's that other A word?
Yes. Fifteen of them in one night. Perhaps he should switch toothpaste?
Are you sure this is what you want, sweetie?
I think we need to get you a different brand, hon. They're a little cheaper.
Oh, but my poor little poopsie must be getting so hungry. Maybe we should get them a little food.
Oooo, looks like the tooth fairy was extra-happy with youuu. 
I made some healthy tofu pudding to celebrate. Who wants some?
Great-grandma has a bladder problem. This helps her out.
Oh, I should tell my son the truth about everything myself. Good day, Mr. President. 
I heard he still lives on the Ute reservation just outside of town.
It's going to be okay, baby. We're going to get you more time.
Doctor! Did you find out what's wrong with him?
It's almost bedtime. If you sleep then time'll go by faster.
Oh, but I suppose it would be good for him. Yes, of course he can go. I'll bring some of clothes over.
Well, some more of your little friends are here to play with you. 
Well, it's my son. He's lost a lot of his baby teeth, and I was starting to get worried.
Eric, you have a little visitor. Is that all right? 
Oh my God! Eric! Eric,  Mommy's here. Sweetie?  Oh, what's wrong with him?
Oh well, no TV for him for a few days.
Here, look at this one. A Toshiba Handibook.
Oh. Well, I'll tell Eric. He's just down in the basement playing with his dolls. 
Oh... N- no, sweetie. I believe those Olympics are just for... "special" children.
That shouldn't be a problem. Eric's Grandma is right near the mall.
This party is very loud, boopy-kins. You'll have to speak up.
Sure, hon. You want some Cheesy Poofs, too?
Oh, thank you so much for coming. Please come in. 
Here we go, kids. We're crossing the state line into Nebraska. 
I'm sorry, Eric. All children find out sooner or later.
That's okay, Eric, I think you need to go spend time with your little friends.
You have nothing to worry about in school tomorrow. Mrs. Broflovski assured me that Kyle doesn't have the picture.
It's okay, Eric. I'll have a talk with Kyle's mother.
Eric, we're almost to Frisco. Why don't we go to the Church's Fried Chicken there?
It's the Toilet Safety Administration, hun. They're gonna do something to the potty.
Well, then. I know a certain kitty-kitty who's sleeping with Mommy tonight.
Don't you see, Governor? I should have a right to have an abortion if I want one.
Your friends and I have all chipped in and we're going to send you up to a weight-management retreat.
Well, what's a nice, handsome, black  man like yourself doing in a pit like South Park?
Hu-old on, dear, let me check.  Hon, I made beefy logs.  I made Cookie Dings.  No, he's not here.
No, sweetie, we have to tend to some of Grandma's business.
Oh, he will. My little poopsiekins is a very good little boy.
Sweetie, Bill Gates is on the phone for you.
Oh, my. The tooth fairy will have to give you a big surprise for losing two teeth in two days.
I mean, what right do I have bringing another child into this overpopulated world? Then again, I should've thought of that before having sex. then againuh-- Oh, I just don't know...
Oh no, thank you so much for your time. 
Oh, all right. I was just at the store buying some apples.
Yes. Every time somebody gets a birthday present Eric gets one too.  Otherwise, he gets a little upset.
Come on, Chef! Haven't you ever heard of a manage o'three?
Ooooh, he's just been feeling under the weather. Maybe you boys can cheer him up. He's in the backyard.
Here hon, I packed you some cheesy poofs and happy tarts.
I'm making you some lunch right now, Eric.
Eric, how would you like to go with me to see Madame Butterfly Friday night?
Oh, what a party that was!  Hmm-hm-hm-hmm. Hmm-hm-hm-hmm. 
It's not him, it's you, Eric.  I don't know what to do with you.
Oh, well, I'm not sure. Actually, Eric is still supposed to be grounded for trying to exterminate the Jews two weeks ago.
Nnno, I got you something that's going to help you win the big spelling bee tomorrow.
Come on, sweetie. Doctor says you need to get home and get lots of rest.
Eric, I promise you, I didn't do anything to your favorite toy. Whoever did this to you, I hate them as much as you do, and I'd do anything to get to the bottom of it.
Eric, snookums! it's time for Mommy to tuck you into your snuggleboat for night-night.  Eric, are you out there in your clubhouse?
Oh. Eric, poopie, sit down.  Mommy has something to tell you. It's just that- well, there is no tooth fairy, Eric. I've been putting all that money under your pillow, and because you got so many teeth fall out, I've actually run out of money and can't go to the grocery store for at least a month.
Well, then, now you should take that money and open up a savings account that has compounded daily interest.
Hmmm. but you're not out of control, muffin. You're my perfect little gum drop.
But Eric, I think maybe the tooth fairy wants you to use that money to learn about saving.
Eric, I talked to you about beating up your friends, didn't I?
It's the most wonderful time of the year
do do do do do do do do-
Well, I think you need to keep your laws off of my body.
And I know it can get scary up in those woods, but just remember, mommy's not far away. 
Oooh, what should I do? I'm playing roulette with my child's life!  Ooo wait, Hairspray is showing in New York, isn't it? Let's go there.
Well, I certainly won't buy him anymore, then... Bill. 
Sweetie, you really can just talk to me if you-
In his room. But, why don't I show you the rest of the house first? 
Not too much, hon. It says on the bottle that too much can be bad.
Stanley told me you had passed on. I'm glad to see that you're better.
Oh, hello sweetie. What did you do today?
Uhoh, Thanksgiving's still a couple of weeks away, sweetie. I haven't gone shoppies yet.
Hon, are you ready for some math problems?
Oh, I just can't stand to see my baby suffer
She talked with her son and says he doesn't have it.
Well, Eric, there's nothing more I can do about it.
It started about four days ago, Doctor, and every day he seems to get worse.
Eric? Poopsiekins?  Eric?  Honey, maybe that's enough computer time. It's been about nineteen hours now.  I know you said not to disturb you with your new toy, but Mommy thought maybe you needed to eat?  All right, I'll just leave it here, hon.  I'm turning in for the night. Mommy loves you.
Hehh, it doesn't look like our protest is working.
Boopie-kins.  It's time to stop preaching damnation to everyone, sweetie. 
You can have an eensy weensy bit, can't you?
Eric, I got you a new history textbook. Why don't you come downstairs.
Eric, stop acting like a spoiled brat! You can either have the Toshiba Handibook or you can have nothing at all!
I just, I- I'm gonna go make you kids some lemonade. 
Oh dear... I was checking out the Internet and ih, it almost seems like his symptoms are like those in something called "Tour, Tourette's Syndrome"?
You have to see the eye doctor, Eric.
Oh my! She must think that you are a very special little muffin.
Yes, but they said two weeks off was enough, and they want everyone back.
Just use a little bit of that stuff, hon. It has to last a while.
You have been bad, so you're gonna have to drink from this glass. 
This year is gonna be different. Look!  I got you "Hooked On Monkey Fonics." 
Hello, everybody.  Now, just do it like we rehearsed, hon.
Then why did you go outside to a police officer and say "Help! Help! My mommy is trying to fuck me!"?
No, you don't have to fly to Russia, hon.
Mmmm-my, how exciting. Would you care to... put your tongue in my mouth?
I know that the NSA is torturing Santa, sweetie. But they're keeping us safe.
Eric?  It must be his time. I think it's running out!
Oh, that's so sweet. Oh, I love you too, poopiekins! 
Well, he's just... out of control. I mean, he never listens to me, and he pretty much runs my life.
Oh, sweetie, those were all lies. You're just fat. 
Oh, you're sounding just like your old self again.
Now you be careful, Eric. The woods can be very dangerous.
Eric dear? I just got a call from your friend Kyle's mother. She said that this show is naughty, and might make you a potty mouth.
I'm back, hon. I got some more calamine lotion. 
Look what I did, Eric. I learned how to make Sumie paintings. I had almost forgotten how artistic I was.
Oh, my little poopsie-kins gets into no-nos once in a while, but he's still my perfect little plumsy-kiddle
Here, Kyle. Will you hold Great-Grandma's catheter bag during dinner? 
And then I saw him. He was the most beautiful, charming piece of ass I'd ever seen in South Park. His name... was Chief Running Water.  I don't recall exactly how the rest of the night went, but the next morning I was pregnant with you, my little blueberry muffin.
There you are, Eric! Come on, we have to go to the eye doctor.
And don't get too close to Kyle. He looks like he might have the AIDS. 
Why hello there. I don't think I've seen you around before. 
You made me look like some sort of child molester in front of all those people!
Here, I made you powdered donut pancake surprise.
I guess it's much better to get it when you're young.
But the person at Unplanned Parenthood said you were who I had to talk to about changing the law.
Ohhh, oh. I'm not sure.  Sweetie, what is your condition?
There's just one problem: he still fights me every step of the way. I feel like he's doing what I tell him, but that inside he's still the same angry spoiled child.
Oh, a- a- all right, sweetie, I- I'll take you tomorrow.
Oh, it's my pleasure. Eric loves his little friends.
How about a nice chocolate chicken pot pie, then?
Oh, you've been so helpful, I uh, just don't know how to thank you.
Eric, you've done a lot of horrible things in your life, but smoking? You're grounded for three weeks!
Oh Cesar, I'm so happy to have you in my life. 
Oh, hello boys. Have you seen Eric around anywhere?
Excuse me, shouldn't we wait for everyone to arrive before we get started?
Don't be difficult, Eric! Now, you go out and play in the fun snow.
Yes they are, but you were supposed to be grounded in your room! And now you're more grounded, young man!
Oh I never saw him after that. Ah-I wasn't really that interested in him.
Aunt Lisa, Cousin Fred, Cousin Alexandra , Fat Bob, Jimmy , and great-grandma Florence. 
Thank you so much for babysitting little Eric, Shelly.
Ah, no, these people claim that they are the "real" psychic detectives. 
Tucky tucky time, it's the best time of the night.
But, honey, it's only September. That...  Nintendo Wii doesn't come out for two months.
Eric, why would you do such a thing?
The best part is I'm not letting him boss me around anymore. I could have never come out and have a nice lunch on a Saturday afternoon with a friend before.
Well, I don't know, Eric. If you did that, then the floors would be bare.
Eric, what have we talked about with that language?! One more time and I'm not taking you anywhere!
Eric, we aren't that much poorer than most people.
I'm sorry I never told you, Eric.  I just thought, maybe it would be a little shocking to you.
Eric, don't you realize you could've seriously injured your little friend?
Oh, that sounds fine. I'm going to a meteor shower party. The number where I'll be is on the refrigerator. Eric's nookie time is 9 o'clock sharp. If his little woogums get cold, you can turn up the heat over here. And if he gets cranky, just play tummy-rub-rubs with him, and make sure he wipes good after he makes bears.
Eric, I'm working two jobs. Mommy's doing everything she can.
Ooohh, hhmmm . Wwell - yyou see, Eric, sometimes when a man and a woman are... attracted to each other , they want to be... close to each other.
Uh sweetie, I see that you're a little... disturbed right now, but, maybe you can-
Mr. Pharmacist, this Ritalin doesn't have any side effects, does it?
Come on, Eric. Let's try to battle your Roostor with my Donkeytron.
What do you say, champ? Think you can tough it out?
Oh, why yes he did. I thought you were dead, Sharon.
Well, I've got an idea. We could sing.
Come on. Do you want your laser corrective surgery or not?
Oh... But I thought we were becoming friends.
Oooh, I'm gonna decorate the house for Halloween,
with scary ghosts and bats and creepy crawly things...
Hello there!
Hello. Um, I would like to... sign my son up, please.
Sweetie, there's a Mr. Pun Li Tsiao on the phone for you?
Hang in there, sweetie. We'll be there soon.
Well, Sheila, we can't shelter our boys forever from these things. Maybe it's okay for them to see an adult film.
Well, I'm letting Eric go to the camp. I mean, it seems to me this Chinpokomon thing is just another harmless fad.
No, it will be fine. How about I make you some hot tea with lemon and codeine?
Oh, he's amazing. I think the change in personality happened. He's doing things for himself now, and he seems to be accepting it. I've lost a best friend, but I've gained a son.
Eric? Sweetie, are you having nightmares about the Chinese again?
Oh, Eric, it's just part of being a child.
Oh, heck. I haven't even started yet. He-he.  I baked cookiees; would anybody like one?! 
Oh dear.
Dr. Doctor:
But I'm more concerned about his state of mind. Your son appears to be completely insane.
Wait. Wait.  Who is that?  Chief... could you excuse me for a minute?
Good night.  What do you have there, Eric?
Well, why don't you get ready for snoogums' night-night, and I'll bring you some toasty chocolate nummers?
Oh wait, wait.  You've got a little eye booger, hon.
Eric, sweetie, there's a bunch of people showing up in our backyard saying something about a meeting?
You're very sweet. Thank you again. Come on, muffin.
