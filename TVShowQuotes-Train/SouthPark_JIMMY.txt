But I have to make it stop! The talent show is this F-Friday.
I just c-can't risk getting up in front of everyone.
Jesus Eric, he's gonna kill you! You won't even admit it was just me, knowing you're gonna die?
More snow for South P... P-P-Park. Here's Token Black with the weather.
Oh! Hey Kyle!  Kyle, hang on a sec. 
Well, Nut Gobbler, I need to get laid.
Just hangin' out. What are you up to?
Thanks for the ride home, fellas. We sure had a ...terrific time.
Hey Stan, did you see Clyde's going out with Lisa B-b-Berger?
To be in our club, not only do you have to be c-c-crippled, but you have to have been born that way. Do you know what that means? No butthole Superman asswipe Christopher Reeve!
On the s...seventh day of Christmas my t...true love ...
Dad, I'm really feeling sad and let down right now, and I feel like I can't even get a response from you. Could I at the very least please just get a what what-what?
Alright Mimsy, m-maybe you can show me how it's done. 
All right, Eric. You can c-c-count on us.
Come on in, everybody. Lots of su-surprises and t-treats inside.  Great to see you all. What a terrific audience.
Wow, what a terrific audience. Isn't this great.  Can I get another wuhwuh wha wha what what?  And now it's time to give out the award for the least funny people in the world. And the nominees are: 
Fellas! Do you have any idea how difficult comedy is? Can't we just spend one lunch and recess saying thanks to those who make us smile and laugh every day?
Stay away from me, you stupid b-b-b-bitches!  No! God!  '
As soon as the bell rings, we've gotta get out there and find a good place to watch the fi-fufu-fight. 
What all the addiction programs say is true. You've gotta reach out to a higher power, Stan. You've gotta get down on your knees, and you've gotta say "I have a problem." And you've gotta ask that higher power for help. 
To be perfectly frank, I peed in the pool about tututwenty five seconds ago.
Now look, I know that I've put every comedian in the world out of work, but you have to admit that in a lot of ways, the first annual Comedy Awards was a success.
Wow, looks like when it comes to comedy, I really t-take the c-keh-c. I really take the cay. I really take the k-keh cake. 
If you get in a pinch, go through, it's a cinch-
Wow, what a terrific audience. So apparently it's been exactly two years since the fall of Baghdad. Have you seen this? Have you heard about this? Just as B-Bush predicted, Baghdad fell, Iraq fell, Saddam fell. The only thing that didn't fall was ...the price of gas.  I just read in the paper that China's protesting Japan. Have you seen this? Have you heard about this? Yeah, I guess in China you don't get to-  You've gotta be kidding me.
Welcome to S-super School News. I'm Jimmy Valmer.
That video could have been made by Sauron's evil f-...forces.
Oh, sure. I'll see if it fits.  This is very warm. Thanks a lot, Tim-Tim. Well, I'll see you around. 
Every student is to go home and vote on their favorite choice in each category. Favorite comedy actor, favorite comedy movie. And then on Friday, during lunch and recess, we're gonna have a big, f-f-f-fantastic comedy awards show.
All right! I I keep getting an erection for no reason! Okay! But I can't get any of the girls here to let me... do it to them.
Ahb. A fireman and a p-p-Polack are eating marshmallows when-
Welcome... to the special ed department's... first annual comedy awards.
Well it's probably bu-better if you don't think about it, Kyle.
Say, fellas! Thanks a lot for goin' to my ...c-comedy show! 
Yes, you certainly are. And for doing that, we have all decided to give you... a comedy award.
There's some chocolates and lih-licorice, and some games and peh- pencils inside.
Don't worry, fellas. I learned my lesson. I promise: there's not gonna be any comedy awards next year!
Don't lecture me on the complexities of sportsmanship. You know as well as I do most of the kids in Special Olympics aren't shooting up to compete. I'm just trying to k-keep up.
Turhr... Ohokahay. Okay, now let's wait ten seconds.  Okay now, t-tell me the first one again?
I guess we all learned that trying to get along is way better than p... player hatin'.  The gang wrote a song about it. Why don't we listen in?
Alright, just run with me on this, Eric. Say Eric, do you like fishsticks?
Kyle please! For fu-fu for for-fu-fuck's sake, don't do anything drastic.
Oh boy, Timmy, it's our favorite time of year.
Hey, what's the matter, Kyle? You seem b-b-bu-bbbummed out.
So I made up my mind that I've just got to find the Tardicaca girl I did adore.
Wendy said she'd be here an hour before school starts. See you in the morning, ch-ch-ch-champ! 
Why sure fellas.  Anyway, be sure to check it out, kid.
Here you go.  Here you  go. Don't forget to...  vote, everyone.  Here you go, fellas. Be sure to get these handed in tomorrow.
N-no, I do NOT want to take off my shirt and kiss
I put together a comedy show and I was crippled from BIRTH! 
Well, to be perfectly f-f-f-frank, Eric, I think I came up with a little bit more of the joke than you did.
Sixty-five... bottles of... beer on the wall. Six- 
On the fifth... day... day of... Christmas,  ...my t-true love gave to... uh... me. Five g-g-g... golden ruh-ring... rings.  Fuhgom... don... t-t... don... four cal...ling buh-irr
We can really stick it to that assm-m-muncher!
Hey, j-j-jackass!  I'm sorry I resorted to calling you jackass just now, but I'm very upset!
Ya yo you can't, you can't do that.
Well, I did Ecstasy once.  Me and my girlfriend took it and we stayed up all night having... sex. 
Eric, I can't tell you why, but it's very important that I score to-night! Can you come on the date and help me? You're like a white... Hitch.
...Excuse me, can you use a different terminology please?
Right. Because you and Mom used to make fun of crippled kids in high school.
Sorry Eric, but I've gotta write some jokes. Unless you wanna team up or somethin'.
Should I try telling him a fa-fantastic joke?
Yeh. Let's go bi- pick on him! Yeh! 
Gee, I don't know what to say, fellas. They're both instant classics. But I guess I'll have to go with giant douche, simply because the fact that it's a giant renders it useless, adding a parody slant to the satire.
Timmy and I made a ...T-shirt design for our new club.  We just came up with a name this morning. 
Uh, I think we're gonna try your authentic pizzareli casserona poppers.
What are you doing here, El, El Pollo Loco?
Not much. I just wanted to make sure you heard the fuh-fantastic news. There's a new Terrance & Phillip mobile game, and it's so amazing and incredibly fun.
Oh hey Eric. Just workin' on some jokes.
You get all the Crips you can to the rec center tomorrow night, Timmy. And I'll try to get all the ...Bloods there.
I know this stuff is hard to understand. Trust me, I know. I'm an addict too. But I got help.
I thought you guys said you didn't need school.
You have to forfeit the fight, Rad Russian! You cannot fight until your test results come ba-back
Fellas! Fellas, I got fant-tastic news! The vice-President, Dick Cheney, was in Denver yesterday, and I got an interview with him for our news show. 
Hey, I-I'm gonna need some help getting in the log, fellas.
Martha Stewart is out of jail. Have you seen this? Have you heard about this?
But nobody can leave until it's seven a.m., so if you wanna have a good time, you're all just gonna have to learn to get along.  Theeerrre's pizzaaa.
Butters, ah I really need to talk to somebody, and I think maybe you're the only person who won't make f-f-fun of me.
Ing-mar ...Bergman.  Now you say, "Ingmar Bergman who?" 
Well what are you, Eric? A gay fish?
Ah I don't see a b- b- Bat-Mobile.
That's an amm-mmazing coincidence. I mean, there's not one crippled colored person in South Park. 
Duh-n, don't worry fellas. Everything's gonna be okay.
Oh, it's okay. We're Crips ourselves. Come on, Tim-Tim.
Well, like, try this one on for size: Knock knock.
Well, sure. Tim and I would love to pop some punk-ass Bloods. We're terrific at it.
Wow, seems like you know a lot about this stuff, Eric. Have you gotten laid before?
Oh my God. You-you're right, Timmy. You're totally right.  Everyone, can I have your attention, please?  I'm afraid I have to give back my medal. The truth is, I haven't been playing fair either. I've been using st-steroids. I was willing to do anything to be the best, and the steroids made me blind to the people I was hurting.  A good friend even tried to talk me out of it, and I wouldn't listen to him.  Taking steroids is just like pretending to be handicapped at the Special Olympics.  Because you're taking all the fairness out of the game. But I know now that even if you do win on steroids, you're really not a winner. You're just a p-pussy. You're just a  big fat p-p-pussy, and if you take steroids, the only decent thing to do is come forward and say,  "Remove me from the record books, because I am a big, stinky p-pussy- "  "-steroid-taking jackass."  That's how I feel about myself, and why I must decline this medal and my place in the history books. And if you'll let me, I'll be back next year. To compete with honor.  '
Hello. We'd like two orders of Kung ...Pao Chicken, please.
Well, in the interview, Mr. Cheney tells me all about how the-
A what? Oh, you mean the fellas. Well sure. But I can't talk about the club on account of its sssuper secret, dawg.
Wow, these guys really are crippled.  Timmy, I have a feeling that this is the start of something b-b-b-b...b-b-brilliant.
Fellas, I know Germany isn't happy with us, but you have to admit that in a lot of ways, the first annual comedy awards was a big success.
Oh, hey Eric. I was just trying to write some new jokes for my comedy  ...rou-routine.
Is it my responsibility what people decide to do with their feh-f-free time? I was just a middleman.  People were going to learn about the game somewhere if not from me. I'm not the one who made it.
Well, you know, I mean, I basically wrote the thing, and you just kind of ate chips.
Fellas, can I have a moment with Stan, please?
Gee, thanks a lot. See you next time.
Oh I sure have. I've been working on my ruh... ruh... routine all year long
And so I said to him, "Hey, I- I may be handicapped, bu-but I'm not... deaf."  Wow, what a terrific audience. Well, for my next joke I'm gonna need a vo-volunteer from the audience, very much. How about you, Timmy?
Wow, this is the greatest day of my life. Thanks everyone, for this incredible award.
Get close to him!  How much do I owe you?
No, we never have. Are they crippled from birth or are they cripple wannabes like Christopher Reeve?
Look! My gang, which I can't talk about because it's super secret, is the most important thing to me now! And if you two don't like it, you can just pass the blunt to the nigga on your left. 
Yeah! Fuck yeah!  Yeah, I did it! I'm the b-bub-best!  '
Say Timmy, did you notice that all the crippled people in that club are negros?
Well gee, that's really nice of you, Mr. ...Chinese person.  Look Tim-Tim, we got a cash prize. We must be the ...one hundredth customer or something.
Eh but I want a PS4, not a crappy XBox.
Hold everything!  Mrs. Garrison, if you don't mind, I'll be taking that microphone..
Wow. You know, I've never thought of it that way before, but you're right. If you're pissing blood, you can shove a tampon up your peehole. You are very insightful. Please tell me more.
But... but why do they hate each other?
Heh, huh okay, that's pretty funny. Now, what's the second?
All you're doing is making the other 99% more angry. I warn you: this could turn very ugly.
Well, Stan. Do you feel, uhb- better now?
Timmy? Timmy? I told you to put on the HAT!!  You dirty motherfucker! 
Yeah. I feel pretty good about it. I finished my whole book report and, I got a really nice letter from my ese who works down at the U-Haul. 
I just think it's a fabulous app, that's all.
Son of a ...b-bitch!  Taxi!  Follow that pimp and ho! 
Woohoo! Alright!  Oh boy, what a terrific audience. Can I get a wuhwuhwuh what? What?  We're here today to honor those who t-t-tirelessly work so hard to make us laugh. The first comedy award we are presenting is for the funniest kid in school. And the nominees are: 
Do you know where they meet? We've already tried the rec center and the library.
Ni- I can- I can't!  Huff. Oh man.  Gee whiz, Timmy. It looks like we have some pretty stiff competition this year.  All of the special athletes seem to be in tip-top condition, and I can't even get past seven ru-reps. Hoh well, that's it for me, Timmy. I'm p-p-p-pooped. I'll see you in the locker room.
But, Mr. Meryl, we're trying to bring the news to the students. They need to know the facts, and our news team delivers them, very much.
Yeah. It's not a bad idea. If all the students unite, we can work together to fight the f-f-fit.
Come on. We have to take the bus to Five Points in Denver.
Stan says you're a cont... you're a- cont- S-Stan says you're a cont- cont-
I gotta guh, I gotta go! See ya fellas.  Eh, excuse me! Evuh evuh - excuh, cuh, cuse me! Excuse me, puh-please. 
Oh Jesus!  You gonna start running your mouth off again?  P-push it! Push it!
Hey fellas. I was just in the neighborhood and I thought I'd stop by to s-gif- gift basket.
Do you feel like maybe you're l-l-losin' her, S-Stan?
Well... then maybe I'll just use them a-al-little bit. You know, as a per-formance en... hancer.
Alright alright! I never played it. I stay away from the stuff.
Oh, so you used ssstemm cells like Christopher Reeve?
I'm glad we're best friends now. See ya at Scouts. 
I told you, lock-ins at the rec center always work. And you know, I've learned something, too. I was player-hatin' Christopher Butthole Reeve because he got more attention than me. But just like... y-you guys, I need to learn to control my a... anger.
Hold it! Don't you see? It doesn't matter if we were crippled from birth, or crippled in an accident. We're all brothers.
Nobody cared about my standup comedy! All that hard work just to be outshined by C-Christopher Reeve the super b-butthole!
Oh, I'm so glad you think so, Shawna, because I really wanna stick my penis in your vagina.
Oh wow, this is so exciting, isn't it?  And the winner is...  Oh my God! Jimmy Valmer! I can't believe I w- won! 
How do you take credit for something you didn't do?!
They're taking it to the vi... the vi... the vii...
Yes, I do have a problem, as a matter of fact! I've spent all my money on this ho, and she's now my only shot at getting laid, and the talent show is only a couple of hours from being over.
Uh besides us, it's the book club and Janice Pinkerton.
The Games are in two days, Nancy. I can't be w-wasting my time.
But where am I going to find a lady to stick my penis in? The talent show is this Friday.
There he is. Hey Kyle!  The parental lock isn't working. Our parents are still watching murder porn.
...You didn't see the new Indiana Jones movie?
"If you're gonna be that way, I don't need to be your friend." Wow, how insightful.
Excuse me, Funnybot. My name is Jimmy, and I'm a stand-up comic. You're putting a lot of good people out of work.
Wow, what a terrific audience. Thank you for giving me this great honor, Mayor. B-before I l, l.. light the tree, I was wondering if I could sing... my favorite ...Christmas song, real quick.
See ya tomorrow at the bake sale, fellas.
No don't worry, everybody. I'm sure that Germany can take a joke just like the rest of us. 
Wha, what, what's the m-matter, f-fellas? Are you ... nnnninjas or p-p-p-pussies?
Why you be trippin', Mom? I mean  come on. I'm finally a part of something, very much.
How about Jimmy Stewart? "Merry Christmas, movie house." And John Travolta. "Oh my God, Mr. Kotter! Mr. Kotter, oh, oh my God, Mr. Kotter!"
Wow, what a what a great audience. So apparently Martha Stewart is out of jail. Have you have you heard about this, have you seen this? She's very excited to get started on her new show, "Martha Stewart Living, with an electronic ankle bracelet."  So it looks like the Vatican has finally chosen a new Pope. Have you seen this, have you heard about this?  A-a-apparently they're going to call him New Pope, a-and refer to John Paul as P-Pope Classic.  Uh,.. so it so it looks like Michael Jackson is having back problem in court.  You know... huh... you uh you know what they say about b-b-b-b-back problems.  Uh, uh gee, what a terrific audience.  What a fantastic audience.
Well hello everyone.  I'm Jim Swanson, and this is my friend Timmy.
Oh boy, here it comes! Here it comes! 
Wow, that is very interesting. Please tell me more.
All we need is some good old-fashioned di... di... di... diplomacy.
Look it's really none of your b-b-b-beeswax, Timmy!
Six geese are laying... fu...five go-oldenh ...uhrings. Fodom... dom... du...du...t...du... Four calling biiirds
Hey, can it, jackass! I just don't want them to know I was here with a different girl.
I'm gonna try to make that Tardicaca gally mine, gally mine.'Cause all the while I'm dreaming of her. My Tardicaca Hola Gal!
Oh sorry, that's not right. Hang on. '
P- Principal Victoria, can you explain how your administration fuh-failed to see this p-p-pro-o-o... p-p-problem.
We get to see all our old friends again. Hey, there's Frances. Hey Frances!
This isn't the news! This a b-b-bastardized quest for ratings! Damnit, we have a journalistic responsibility to bring students the fa... the facts!  Don't you see what we've done? In our efforts to compete with Craig's small-minded show, we've made a mockery of n-nununews reporting. I remember when we all made an oath to each other, way back when started playing news reporter, that we would never let anything jeopardize our integrity! Well our integrity is jeopardized! And if we can't report news the honest way, what good is n-news reporting? 
It's a snap at Tardicaca Camp to learn to do the hula hula danceI fell in love with a Tardicaca dove while doin' that funny funny dance.And that poor little kid, why she never did know what love had in store.So I made up my mind-
Ruh really? Wow, you would help me even though I'm crippled. You are caring and not fat. 
Wait a minute. Fishsticks... Fish. Dicks.  Ohmigod! It's so obvious. How did I never think of it before? 
You did a great job in the 500, Timmy. You're really im-p-p-proving.
I think I really got a shot at the gold in the swimming competition. Coach says I'm the fastest he's ever seen. Well, I'll see you nice and early for p-practice, Tim-Tim. Oh, uh, can you hand me my bag?
Yeah! And the most unbelievable part? It's totally free. You should download it to your phone right now. I mean, come. On. If it's free, why wouldn't you?
Down like a clown, Charlie Br... Down like a clown, Charlie B-broooowww... Down like a clown, Charlie Browh... Bro-uh-own. Down like a clown, Charlie Br-Brown. 
The national news? Oh my gosh! People do care! 
Just old junk, and boxes of Eric's mom's d-dildos
Gee, th-they're both screamingly funny, fellas. Better give it another ten seconds. All right, now we'll see which one really has staying power. Number one?
Before school starts. Everyone's gonna get there early.
This is my fault, Stan. I should have never told you the game was fuh fufuh fan-fantastic.
I have no problem taking the test. I have nothing to hi-huhiii-hide
You can check the freezer. There might be some frozen fishsticks or somethin', if you like fishsticks. 
Well, he didn't actually... write any of it. He just uh...
Look, Timmy. There's a convenience store.  That must be what the fellas meant by "pop some punk-ass Bloods." They want us to get them some soda pop and treats.  Let's buy them ginger ale and marshmallows. Then they'll let us in the club for sure.
And what about you, Stan? We were all in the theater that day. We all... saw it happen.
Well of couse I wanna get laid. That's why I'm taking you to this ...fancy place and pretending to be interested in what you have to say..
I'm trying to get laid. What's it look like?
All right! Everyone together! Are we gonna beat Red Team this year?
Timmy and I are competing in a variety of events.
Out on the beach with my cute little peach where the waves are rolling in so highHolding her hand, our feet on the sand-
Wow, w-we've got to do something, Timmy. We've gotta get the Crips and Bloods to sstop fighting. I bet if we could just get them together... but how? Wu-wait a minute! I've got it! A lock-in at the rec center! We did it for our church once. All we do is rent out the rec center overnight. They lock the doors so nobody can leave, and then everyone has the whole night to play in the swimming pool and laugh and talk.
I'm trying to write jokes. But I'm not as funny as you, so it's tough.
I always knew deep down that Wendy didn't have any ba-ba-balls.
Wow, what a great audience... How about this classic? Knock-knock.
She just- w-walked away, Stan. You're gonna have to face facts. It's over. 
I have a raging hard-on that just won't quit, and the talent show has already started.
Well fellas, entertainment is my life. I love being in front of everyone.  Aaah!
Well, I sure have met a lot of interesting people here in South Park.  H-how about that Eric Cartman kid, huh? "Goddamnit! God-. No, Kitty, that's my pot pie! Goddamnit! Eh, Goddamnit!" 
The Ch-Chinese will take someone to space for t-t-ten million dollars.
Don't worry, Nut Gobbler! I'm coming!  Oh Jesus, not now.  Oh boy, this is embarrassing. 
That'd be great! I've always wanted to work with you. You're really funny and you're totally not fat.
Wow, what a great audience. For my first joke, I'm going to need a... volunteer. Come on up here, Tim-Tim.  Timmy, when I tell you to do something, you do it!
Because I, maybe I don't have what it takes to win with-without them!
Nathan, your team put up an amazing fight. And even though I was crowned the King of Cripple Camp, I want you to know that you were the real ch-cha, champ.
Oh, uh, so... hey, Timmy... uh hu-how about we go out for a s-s-soda later?  I'll uh, I-I'll see you later, Tim-Tim.
It's a- v- validation of all your efforts. An acknowledgement of all you do in the pursuit of humor.
...So the Pope says, "What are you, a stinking e-evolutionist?"
Come on, push it! Push it!  Yeah. Nice p-pecs. Sweet b-biceps. 
W-well, I-I mean he, he was in the room.
I said, shut your mouth, bitch! Why did you make me do it, huh?!  You're not leavin' anybody! You just keep your G-Goddamned mouth shut and do what you're t-t-t-uh-tol-told!  '
Hey Timmy. How many able-bodied people does it take to screw in a light bulb? One.  You know what you call an able-bodied guy on the doorstep? Whatever his name is. 
Ohhhh nothin'. It's just that... y-you might wanna invest in some hedge clippers. 
Not really. You're just a hooker, and I need to get laid. The talent show could be over any minute.
So, when your penis becomes hard, you're supposed to put in in a lady's vagina. And then it stops being hard?
Please, I wasn't starting rumors about you. I don't even know who you are.
I'm... not gonna perform in the talent show. 
Then why does God make it so that my penis gets hard if girls don't wanna have it in their vaginas? It's like a cruel joke.
Can't go too easy on her though. God forbid she actually gets in a good good punch and... beats ya.
What's the matter is this Funnybot has taken the humanity out of comedy. I don't think things are better, I think they're worse.
Yeah, Dad. We've been going out since we met in Free Period last week.
Well, let us tell you a little bit about ourselves. Timmy and I are both true Crips, born and raised. We're the only Crips in South Park, where we live, and we would love to join your fa-fa-fabtasitc Denver chapter.
I'll tell you one thing: their food hasn't been getting along with my stomach for years.
I agree. I mean, it's like  "come on"! Why do these people who become crippled later in life think they're such great pot-potatuhs?
Eugh! Stay on him! I'm not giving up! 
What's that? Oh, and one medium lemonade, please.
So is that when I t- tell you that your girlfriend is a whore?
Okay. Try this one on for size: Why did the... pigeon cross the road?
S-s-s-so what are you gonna do now, huh?! You gonna be a fuckin' narc and show that b-bottle to the... coaches?!  Don't think you're any better than me, Timmy! I'm just living in the real world!  Fuck!
Orange you glad I didn't say banoo'n? Orange you glad I didn't say banoo'n? Orange you glad I didn't say bbb? Orange you glad I didn't say beh buhuhnnnaana?
Hello? Hello? I need to put my ...p-penis in a woman's vagina. Any takers?  Excuse me, ma'am. What's your name?
Well, that sure was a terrific time. Let's go all around tomorrow and show everyone our new outfits, Timmy.
Yeah. Where the hell have you guys ...been?
Hello sir, we are here on behalf of all fourth graders at South Park Elementary.
C-C-Cartman's army is getting bigger every day. In addition to the Federation and the kindergartners, the XBox army now also has the kids who play Harry Potter, the jocks, the swim team, and the glee club.
That's right. Red Robin has doors on the inside that go right out into the mall.
You you aren't gonna... tell anybody, are you?
You can s-, you can suck, suck my balls!
She's apparently gotten real good with baking cakes with keys in them. 
So does that mean we can join the c-c...club?
Eric, there's something I really need to know.
Well, we, we were just talking about ideas for jokes and then-
Well, the, the reason I think I would make the perfect foreh- friend, is that I love telling jokes. You know, who doesn't like to laugh?
Say fellas, Jimmy and I were wondering if maybe you would come and cheer for us next S-S-Saturday. We're both competing in the Special Olympics down in Denver.
Gee, that's a terrible thing, Eric. Um comedy can be the best therapy, very much.
This is authentic Italian food straight from S-Sicily. You should try the Lotsa Mozzarella Pizza Roll.
Look, it's my b-body and it's my choice what I put in it!
With her naughty little wiggle. I know someday
They are coming.  You guys go on ahead.
Last joke ever? What's that supposed to mean? 
Sure, come on up here, Tim-Tim.  Timmy, ladies and gentlemen. Let's give him a hand, very much. Come to think of it, give him a pair of legs, too.  Here, Timmy, put on this silly hat.  Just for a second, Timmy.  Don't be a jerk, Timmy.  Hey, don't push me!
Face it: Stan's crappy singing is what sssunk us!
Why do you think freemium games send you those text notifications when you haven't played in a while? It's called a trigger. A quick image to trigger the addict's brain. They know exactly what they're doing.
Well, I don't think I did too well in the... bathing suit competition. But I can't wait for the talent show competition. That'll really my chance to... shine.  Wow, what a terrific audience. So anyway, a guy walks into a buh- ...A guy walks into a b- ...buh...  A guy walks into a guy walks into a  babuh ba-a-a, uh- 
M-Maybe you should just talk to her. You know, a little conversation. Tell her... what you feel. Sometimes you feel like there's a b-burnin' inside you, like a-
Thanks a lot, fellas. Well, we gotta get down to the training center and start working out. Word is we have a lot of sssstiff competition this year.
Yeah, I love when Morgan Freeman explains stuff.
...and the winner for best comedy performance in a movie is...  Ben Stiller! Come on up here, Ben.  Is Ben Stiller here?  No? Huh... I guess B-ben Stiller could not be with us, so I'll accept this award on his behalf.  And the award for funniest correspondents dinner speech goes to...  President Obama!  Is President Obama here? No? Ah I guess we'll just accept this award on his behalf.
Hello, Mrs. M-marsh. Can I help g- Can I help you get a sh- shopping cart today?
Please sir, the kids at my school are all being held hostage, and if we don't speak to Funnybot, they could all be k-k-killed.
Now hold on a second, fellas. If you're the 83%, then our class is only 17%.
Well, y-you gotta admit, Lisa Berger is pretty hot, Wendy.
Funnybot, this is not a good joke. There won't be anyone around to laugh.
Well, sure, Eric. W-w-what seems to be the p-p-p-prrroblem?
Hey fellas.  You should come downstairs. Stan's mom made pa-pizza.
The price of milk money will go up next Monday to 49 cents. The school claims the added money is due to the cow shortage in South Park County.
Butters, do you know what you're supposed to do when your penis gets hard?
Well, hello, Eric. I was really glad you called me, very much.
But if he's 1% of 17%, then he's .17%.
The Terrance & Phillip mobile game.  All the cool kids are usin' it.
We're finally gonna learn the chocking truth of who Phillip f-farted on.
It's a figure of speech with crippled people. We'd say we lost an arm and a leg, but they ain't worth much.
Do you think things can ever go back to n-n-n, n-no, normal after this?
Yeah, it sure is tough. I'm training really hard, but I'm not improving fast enough, and the Special Olympics are a... week away.
...and a par-tridge in a... p...pear t...t...tree. On the third day of C...Chrihhh...Chriiii...
Yeah. Yeah, I'm real excited. REAL excited... for some reason... Oh, Jesus! What's wrong with me?
Say, would you guys like to join our club? Oh, I'm sorry. You can't. You aren't crippled. 
I said I'm coming! Give me a Goddamned s-second!  Hold it. 
We're going to an authentic Italian restaurant, Buca de Fagghecini
Really? M-maybe I can catch the bus ...and get down there before the talent show ends. Th-thanks, Officer Barbrady! 
And that's all for Super School News. Enjoy your day at South Park Eh-Eh-Eh-Eh- &gt; Ehehehehe  Eh-Elementary. /&gt;
Come, on, just try it out. You can be Terrance or Phillip or both. You can walk around and collect Canada cash to build new stuff.  It's the perfect thing if you're bored. And honestly, the best part about it, is it's free. I mean, come. On. Why wouldn't you download it, and just try it out? 
Bu- bu- bu- bu- bu- bu- bu- bu- Butters!
I thought I could go on like before. But after seeing Indiana get raped... After seeing Indiana get raped I know I'll never be the sa-a-ame, the same? The same.  Do you remember that scene with Indiana in the refrigerator?  It didn't make any sense, Stan.
How do you know?! You you haven't s-seen it yet!
Fellas! Don't you see? This proves my point. We have to elevate our ideas up, not down.
Oh, uh, wow, that is very interesting. Please tell me more.
Yeah, nothing's changed. Our opinion of you can't possible go any lower.
On the el- el- el- eleventh of C- Christmas my t...true love gave to me, e-eleven p-p-pipers p-pu-p-piping...
Hey! Just what the hell do you think you're doing, Eric?! '
How do you live with yourself? You know you had nothing to do with the fishsticks joke.  But you just keep pretending. How do you look at yourself in the f-f-fucking mirror?! That's what I want to know!
Well jumpin' Jesus, what are we wasting our time here for then? The talent show is happening right now! Let's get to r-r-rammin'! 
In her... va-vagina.  Thank you, thank you. What a terrific audience.
Wow, what a great audience. I just flew into South Park. Boy, are my crutches tired!  What a terrific audience. You know, sometimes people ask me, "Are you angry at God for making disabled people?" I say, "No, I think the world is better with puh-President Bush." 
Well, Eric, pah part of being nice is just making people smile and laugh. The best way to do that is by telling a fan-tastic joke or a humorous anti-d- ant'duhh ...anecdote.
Sorry Mims, I I just can't remember it.
We just have one question before we join your c-club. Do you think it's better to be born a Crip, or to become a Crip later by accident?
Uhhh, just uh ahh not right this second, Mr. Mackey.
Timmy, don't make me k... kick you ass!
Fellas, are you sure all of this ie-eh-ethical?
Why is a celebrity who became crippled more important than us that were born that way, very much.
Yeah. We told them that, a-and they told us to go f-fuck ourselves.
You know that the PS4 is a better choice. I mean, come on.
Hey, Craig. Have you checked out the Internet lately? 
Hey fellas, mind if we take a little re-rest?
Yeah well, I guess I'll be seeing you, you friends later. 
Boy, isn't this great fellas? Are we great pals or what?
Oh, hey Timmy. I'm glad you called, very much. I've been detecting some a-animosity towards me lately, and I was hoping we could bury the hatchet.
No need to worry about me. I'm cool like a fool in a swimming ppp-ppp-pp-pp-pool. 
... Gee, you didn't have to do that. I mean, I understand why you've been jealous of my talent.  If you work at it, maybe you could be as... handi-capable as I am, huh?  Wow, a parka.  You-you didn't have to do that, Tim-Tim.
That's a... fantastic idea fellas. Uh, the key to successful humor is s-staying power. Uh, tell me the first mascot idea.
What do I have? The weapon of comedy. So apparently the Chinese and the Japanese aren't getting along lately. Have you seen this? Have you heard about this?
...and a par-tridge in a... p...pear tree. On the ...fourth day of C...C...Ca...Chriiiistmas my t-true love g-ge-gave to me-mee.
I beg to differ with you, sir. I paid for her and took her out to dinner. She's my ho!
But don't you see? This is why comedy is for humans. You need to leave the jokes to people like me and Adam Sandler.
Wow, thanks Mom.  You might have saved my life.
Well I just but I buh I was, gonna ebeh-
Any word on who shot up me and Timmy's houses, officer?
Oh, I don't think that'll be hard. I've been working on my rr... routine.
They took it back to the video s... the video s...
No food at a party? And I thought I was handicapped! 
Why don't we at least give it a chance? I mean,  Come on! 
Wow, what a great audience.  Well, just in case you were wondering, I do have a disability. I am totally happy with the way I was born, very much. I travel to different states and talk to kids about being proud of what they are. My mom says that God has a p-plan for everyone. I guess I was plan B.  You guys like im- personations? 
Wow, I've never thought of it that way before, but you're right.
Jesus Christ!  Holy G...guacamole!  Freakin' Frijoles!  Leapin' L-langosta. 
Oh my God! That's it! Fellas, get me a Ken doll and some Scotch tape.  Funnybot, I've been talking it over with the fellas and actually, we think what you're doing is genius.
Well then that settles it! Fellas, what we're gonna hafta do is try to ch... change the Scouts' rules, very much.
Wow Eric, in-credible! Too bad I'm a dick and I'm gonna take all the credit. Su-su-suck it, bitch!
What?  Hey wait a minute! This is crazy! You can't do this!
And how about that school counselor? "Uh, dr-, drugs are b-bad."  "Uh. Drugs are bad, okay? Uh, drugs are, drugs are bad, okay? Okay?"  Wow, what a great audience. "Mr. Hat. Be quiet, Mr. Hat. Mr.-"  "Hello there, children. Mr. Hat. Hello- Mr. Hat"  "I'm making Salisbury steak for lunch."  "Salisbury steak for lunch." Eh. Uh. "Goddamnit, Goddamnit!"  And of course, my very favorite, "Timmy! Huh. Timmy! Uh liv-, I'm living a lie! I'm living a lie, Timmy!"  "Ti- Timmy, I'm living a lie. Heh, heh. Ah Timmy." Heh. Sometimes it's like, "Please, Timmy, learn a new word," heh. "Timmy! Tu-Timmy!" 
Well Bertha, I was wondering if I could stick my penis in your vagina?
Can you believe it, Timmy? All this time there was a group for truly crippled people like ourselves, and we didn't know it.
Well, Kenny deserves to know, fellas. If you guys found out my girlfriend was a raging whore, I'd want you to t-tell me.
Don't worry, everybody. I've spared no expense to make my comedy awards the biggest thing this school has ever seen. You're all gonna have a blast. 
I have had it with those loud, annoying, f-f-f f-faggots.
From the n-n- from the nn-, from the nn-
This is an outrage! Who out there is saying that our friend Stan is a liar?
Well, the best thing is not to act nice, Eric. Uh, the best thing is to be genuinely nice.
You f-f f-faked being handicapped to win?!  I should k- ick your ass right here, you lousy no-good ch-ch-cheater!
Oh, well, sure. I've never really tried working with a partner, but let's give it a sho- a sh- a-sh, a-sh, shotaroosky. Let's see... I was workin' on this: Why does a squirrel swim on its back? To keep his -nuts dry.
He said "at Ruh ruh rruh ruh Reh Red"
Fellas, this is our chance! Everyone get your hair looking as fantastic as possible. It's time for us to do the most incredible investigative news report of our journalistic lives!
Because it was having sex with the chihi... Because it was having sex with the ch-hi-hi... Because it was having sex with the ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch...  eh, it was having sex with the ch-ch-hiicken. 
You're a man now! All right Butters good job!
It's called a lock-in at the rec center. We can use all the rec center facilities. We can play basketball, go swimming, or even just kick it in the lounge area with some games and ...p-puzzles.
