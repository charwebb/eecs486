How do you live with yourself? You know you had nothing to do with the fishsticks joke.  But you just keep pretending. How do you look at yourself in the f-f-fucking mirror?! That's what I want to know!
To be perfectly frank, I peed in the pool about tututwenty five seconds ago.
Do you feel like maybe you're l-l-losin' her, S-Stan?
Alright blue team. As team captain, I need to make sure we are ready for the big camp competition.
Hey, can it, jackass! I just don't want them to know I was here with a different girl.
Look: we hve the whole rec room to ourselves. Can't we all just try having some fun together?
Ohhhh nothin'. You just might wanna... hire Tarzan to do some... landscaping work for your mom. 
Yo, don't be dissing my niggaz, dawg. They're my f... friends.
Wow. You know, I've never thought of it that way before, but you're right. If you're pissing blood, you can shove a tampon up your peehole. You are very insightful. Please tell me more.
Bu- bu- bu- bu- bu- bu- bu- bu- Butters!
Dad, I'm really feeling sad and let down right now, and I feel like I can't even get a response from you. Could I at the very least please just get a what what-what?
As soon as the bell rings, we've gotta get out there and find a good place to watch the fi-fufu-fight. 
No don't worry, everybody. I'm sure that Germany can take a joke just like the rest of us. 
Well, we're glad you see it our way, fellas. So can we join your g... group?
On the s...seventh day of Christmas my t...true love ...
Oh my God. You-you're right, Timmy. You're totally right.  Everyone, can I have your attention, please?  I'm afraid I have to give back my medal. The truth is, I haven't been playing fair either. I've been using st-steroids. I was willing to do anything to be the best, and the steroids made me blind to the people I was hurting.  A good friend even tried to talk me out of it, and I wouldn't listen to him.  Taking steroids is just like pretending to be handicapped at the Special Olympics.  Because you're taking all the fairness out of the game. But I know now that even if you do win on steroids, you're really not a winner. You're just a p-pussy. You're just a  big fat p-p-pussy, and if you take steroids, the only decent thing to do is come forward and say,  "Remove me from the record books, because I am a big, stinky p-pussy- "  "-steroid-taking jackass."  That's how I feel about myself, and why I must decline this medal and my place in the history books. And if you'll let me, I'll be back next year. To compete with honor.  '
Wow, what a great audience... How about this classic? Knock-knock.
Well, y-you gotta admit, Lisa Berger is pretty hot, Wendy.
But don't you see? This is why comedy is for humans. You need to leave the jokes to people like me and Adam Sandler.
I think I really got a shot at the gold in the swimming competition. Coach says I'm the fastest he's ever seen. Well, I'll see you nice and early for p-practice, Tim-Tim. Oh, uh, can you hand me my bag?
Hold it! Don't you see? It doesn't matter if we were crippled from birth, or crippled in an accident. We're all brothers.
The Terrance & Phillip mobile game.  All the cool kids are usin' it.
What do I have? The weapon of comedy. So apparently the Chinese and the Japanese aren't getting along lately. Have you seen this? Have you heard about this?
I just c-can't risk getting up in front of everyone.
Excuse me, sir.  we're looking for a group of people called the Crips.
M-Maybe you should just talk to her. You know, a little conversation. Tell her... what you feel. Sometimes you feel like there's a b-burnin' inside you, like a-
Hey Timmy. How many able-bodied people does it take to screw in a light bulb? One.  You know what you call an able-bodied guy on the doorstep? Whatever his name is. 
Alright, just run with me on this, Eric. Say Eric, do you like fishsticks?
W-well, I-I mean he, he was in the room.
Fellas! Don't you see? This proves my point. We have to elevate our ideas up, not down.
Well, I sure have met a lot of interesting people here in South Park.  H-how about that Eric Cartman kid, huh? "Goddamnit! God-. No, Kitty, that's my pot pie! Goddamnit! Eh, Goddamnit!" 
Gee, th-they're both screamingly funny, fellas. Better give it another ten seconds. All right, now we'll see which one really has staying power. Number one?
We're finally gonna learn the chocking truth of who Phillip f-farted on.
Fellas, I know Germany isn't happy with us, but you have to admit that in a lot of ways, the first annual comedy awards was a big success.
Boy, isn't this great fellas? Are we great pals or what?
He said "at Ruh ruh rruh ruh Reh Red"
It's a figure of speech with crippled people. We'd say we lost an arm and a leg, but they ain't worth much.
Yeah. I feel pretty good about it. I finished my whole book report and, I got a really nice letter from my ese who works down at the U-Haul. 
A what? Oh, you mean the fellas. Well sure. But I can't talk about the club on account of its sssuper secret, dawg.
But nobody can leave until it's seven a.m., so if you wanna have a good time, you're all just gonna have to learn to get along.  Theeerrre's pizzaaa.
Oh boy, here it comes! Here it comes! 
Yeah.  We've gotta geh- ...geh... get the hell ...outta here f- f-hast fast. 
Well, to be perfectly f-f-f-frank, Eric, I think I came up with a little bit more of the joke than you did.
No food at a party? And I thought I was handicapped! 
Hold everything!  Mrs. Garrison, if you don't mind, I'll be taking that microphone..
I'm... not gonna perform in the talent show. 
We can really stick it to that assm-m-muncher!
But... but why do they hate each other?
Please sir, the kids at my school are all being held hostage, and if we don't speak to Funnybot, they could all be k-k-killed.
Well it's probably bu-better if you don't think about it, Kyle.
You f-f f-faked being handicapped to win?!  I should k- ick your ass right here, you lousy no-good ch-ch-cheater!
Oh, uh, so... hey, Timmy... uh hu-how about we go out for a s-s-soda later?  I'll uh, I-I'll see you later, Tim-Tim.
Yeah. We told them that, a-and they told us to go f-fuck ourselves.
Butters, ah I really need to talk to somebody, and I think maybe you're the only person who won't make f-f-fun of me.
What's the matter is this Funnybot has taken the humanity out of comedy. I don't think things are better, I think they're worse.
I said I'm coming! Give me a Goddamned s-second!  Hold it. 
I know who he is! But why is everyone ditching my comedy show to see him?!
Go!  You shall not...pah..? You shall not..puh...  You shall not paah...  You shall not pa--!  You shall not paah--!  You shall not puh-uh-uh--  You shall not pass. 
This is my fault, Stan. I should have never told you the game was fuh fufuh fan-fantastic.
Well, we, we were just talking about ideas for jokes and then-
Look! My gang, which I can't talk about because it's super secret, is the most important thing to me now! And if you two don't like it, you can just pass the blunt to the nigga on your left. 
Say, would you guys like to join our club? Oh, I'm sorry. You can't. You aren't crippled. 
Well, Stan. Do you feel, uhb- better now?
Kyle please! For fu-fu for for-fu-fuck's sake, don't do anything drastic.
The price of milk money will go up next Monday to 49 cents. The school claims the added money is due to the cow shortage in South Park County.
And the winner is... the Germans!  Uhhh... I guess unfortunately the Germans could not be with us tonight. So I will accept this award on their behalf.  Auf Wiedersehen.  And now, for the Kathy Griffin Award. The Kathy Griffin Award will be given each year to the person who is most likely to actually show up to receive the Kathy Griffin Award. And the winner is...  Tyler Perry. 
Do you think things can ever go back to n-n-n, n-no, normal after this?
Wow, what a terrific audience. Isn't this great.  Can I get another wuhwuh wha wha what what?  And now it's time to give out the award for the least funny people in the world. And the nominees are: 
Heh, huh okay, that's pretty funny. Now, what's the second?
Wait a minute. Fishsticks... Fish. Dicks.  Ohmigod! It's so obvious. How did I never think of it before? 
You know that the PS4 is a better choice. I mean, come on.
Wow, that is very interesting. Please tell me more.
So is that when I t- tell you that your girlfriend is a whore?
Here you go.  Here you  go. Don't forget to...  vote, everyone.  Here you go, fellas. Be sure to get these handed in tomorrow.
Well fellas, entertainment is my life. I love being in front of everyone.  Aaah!
Eric, there's something I really need to know.
Any word on who shot up me and Timmy's houses, officer?
Look, Timmy. There's a convenience store.  That must be what the fellas meant by "pop some punk-ass Bloods." They want us to get them some soda pop and treats.  Let's buy them ginger ale and marshmallows. Then they'll let us in the club for sure.
See ya tomorrow at the bake sale, fellas.
Fellas! Fellas, I got fant-tastic news! The vice-President, Dick Cheney, was in Denver yesterday, and I got an interview with him for our news show. 
Wow, what a great audience. For my first joke, I'm going to need a... volunteer. Come on up here, Tim-Tim.  Timmy, when I tell you to do something, you do it!
There he is. Hey Kyle!  The parental lock isn't working. Our parents are still watching murder porn.
Alright Mimsy, m-maybe you can show me how it's done. 
Yeah, it sure is tough. I'm training really hard, but I'm not improving fast enough, and the Special Olympics are a... week away.
I thought you guys said you didn't need school.
What's that? Oh, and one medium lemonade, please.
But, Mr. Meryl, we're trying to bring the news to the students. They need to know the facts, and our news team delivers them, very much.
Yeah. It's not a bad idea. If all the students unite, we can work together to fight the f-f-fit.
Wow, what a what a great audience. So apparently Martha Stewart is out of jail. Have you have you heard about this, have you seen this? She's very excited to get started on her new show, "Martha Stewart Living, with an electronic ankle bracelet."  So it looks like the Vatican has finally chosen a new Pope. Have you seen this, have you heard about this?  A-a-apparently they're going to call him New Pope, a-and refer to John Paul as P-Pope Classic.  Uh,.. so it so it looks like Michael Jackson is having back problem in court.  You know... huh... you uh you know what they say about b-b-b-b-back problems.  Uh, uh gee, what a terrific audience.  What a fantastic audience.
Say Timmy, did you notice that all the crippled people in that club are negros?
Sixty-five... bottles of... beer on the wall. Six- 
Is it my responsibility what people decide to do with their feh-f-free time? I was just a middleman.  People were going to learn about the game somewhere if not from me. I'm not the one who made it.
I'll tell you one thing: their food hasn't been getting along with my stomach for years.
Come on, push it! Push it!  Yeah. Nice p-pecs. Sweet b-biceps. 
There's nothing here, Kyle. Not even one s-s-scooby clue.
What all the addiction programs say is true. You've gotta reach out to a higher power, Stan. You've gotta get down on your knees, and you've gotta say "I have a problem." And you've gotta ask that higher power for help. 
I have a raging hard-on that just won't quit, and the talent show has already started.
Hey! Just what the hell do you think you're doing, Eric?! '
Ing-mar ...Bergman.  Now you say, "Ingmar Bergman who?" 
I'm gonna try to make that Tardicaca gally mine, gally mine.'Cause all the while I'm dreaming of her. My Tardicaca Hola Gal!
Oh sorry, that's not right. Hang on. '
...So the Pope says, "What are you, a stinking e-evolutionist?"
The Ch-Chinese will take someone to space for t-t-ten million dollars.
Well, the, the reason I think I would make the perfect foreh- friend, is that I love telling jokes. You know, who doesn't like to laugh?
Ni- I can- I can't!  Huff. Oh man.  Gee whiz, Timmy. It looks like we have some pretty stiff competition this year.  All of the special athletes seem to be in tip-top condition, and I can't even get past seven ru-reps. Hoh well, that's it for me, Timmy. I'm p-p-p-pooped. I'll see you in the locker room.
Hey fellas. I was just in the neighborhood and I thought I'd stop by to s-gif- gift basket.
Say fellas, Jimmy and I were wondering if maybe you would come and cheer for us next S-S-Saturday. We're both competing in the Special Olympics down in Denver.
Well, sure. Tim and I would love to pop some punk-ass Bloods. We're terrific at it.
But I have to make it stop! The talent show is this F-Friday.
All right! I I keep getting an erection for no reason! Okay! But I can't get any of the girls here to let me... do it to them.
Pssst. Hey, kid. Come over here.  Yeah, come on over. Ch-check this out. You looking to have some fun?
Can't go too easy on her though. God forbid she actually gets in a good good punch and... beats ya.
Yeah well, I guess I'll be seeing you, you friends later. 
Hello. We'd like two orders of Kung ...Pao Chicken, please.
You're a man now! All right Butters good job!
Well hello everyone.  I'm Jim Swanson, and this is my friend Timmy.
Well I just but I buh I was, gonna ebeh-
I just don't understand it, Dad. It's like, nobody cares about winning their comedy awards. The only people who showed up were me and Tyler Perry.
You can s-, you can suck, suck my balls!
Oh, so you used ssstemm cells like Christopher Reeve?
How do you know?! You you haven't s-seen it yet!
They're taking it to the vi... the vi... the vii...
Should I try telling him a fa-fantastic joke?
Uh besides us, it's the book club and Janice Pinkerton.
No, we never have. Are they crippled from birth or are they cripple wannabes like Christopher Reeve?
Oh boy, Timmy, we should have never started a gang for people crippled from birth. Now they're at war with the people who are crippled from an accident. Boy were we wrong.
All we need is some good old-fashioned di... di... di... diplomacy.
Gee, that's a terrible thing, Eric. Um comedy can be the best therapy, very much.
I always knew deep down that Wendy didn't have any ba-ba-balls.
Say, fellas! Thanks a lot for goin' to my ...c-comedy show! 
You can't run away from it forever,  Stan! Sooner or later, we all have to face what we fe-fe-fehh fehsow.
Hey, I-I'm gonna need some help getting in the log, fellas.
Orange you glad I didn't say banoo'n? Orange you glad I didn't say banoo'n? Orange you glad I didn't say bbb? Orange you glad I didn't say beh buhuhnnnaana?
How do you take credit for something you didn't do?!
Jesus Christ, I think I've died and... gone to... heaven.
Come, on, just try it out. You can be Terrance or Phillip or both. You can walk around and collect Canada cash to build new stuff.  It's the perfect thing if you're bored. And honestly, the best part about it, is it's free. I mean, come. On. Why wouldn't you download it, and just try it out? 
So does that mean we can join the c-c...club?
"If you're gonna be that way, I don't need to be your friend." Wow, how insightful.
On the el- el- el- eleventh of C- Christmas my t...true love gave to me, e-eleven p-p-pipers p-pu-p-piping...
The Park County School Board has approved a bigger budget for the computer lab up-
Oh, hey Eric. I was just trying to write some new jokes for my comedy  ...rou-routine.
Well, in the interview, Mr. Cheney tells me all about how the-
Last joke ever? What's that supposed to mean? 
I thought I could go on like before. But after seeing Indiana get raped... After seeing Indiana get raped I know I'll never be the sa-a-ame, the same? The same.  Do you remember that scene with Indiana in the refrigerator?  It didn't make any sense, Stan.
Aha! I thought I would find you here, Triceratops!
It's a snap at Tardicaca Camp to learn to do the hula hula danceI fell in love with a Tardicaca dove while doin' that funny funny dance.And that poor little kid, why she never did know what love had in store.So I made up my mind-
Then why does God make it so that my penis gets hard if girls don't wanna have it in their vaginas? It's like a cruel joke.
That's right. Red Robin has doors on the inside that go right out into the mall.
Wow, what a terrific audience. Thank you for giving me this great honor, Mayor. B-before I l, l.. light the tree, I was wondering if I could sing... my favorite ...Christmas song, real quick.
Well then that settles it! Fellas, what we're gonna hafta do is try to ch... change the Scouts' rules, very much.
Butters, do you know what you're supposed to do when your penis gets hard?
Ruh really? Wow, you would help me even though I'm crippled. You are caring and not fat. 
Yeah, nothing's changed. Our opinion of you can't possible go any lower.
And what about you, Stan? We were all in the theater that day. We all... saw it happen.
Hey fellas, mind if we take a little re-rest?
Well... then maybe I'll just use them a-al-little bit. You know, as a per-formance en... hancer.
Jesus Christ!  Holy G...guacamole!  Freakin' Frijoles!  Leapin' L-langosta. 
We're going to an authentic Italian restaurant, Buca de Fagghecini
Funnybot, this is not a good joke. There won't be anyone around to laugh.
...and a par-tridge in a... p...pear tree. On the ...fourth day of C...C...Ca...Chriiiistmas my t-true love g-ge-gave to me-mee.
Stan says you're a cont... you're a- cont- S-Stan says you're a cont- cont-
N-no, I do NOT want to take off my shirt and kiss
Well Bertha, I was wondering if I could stick my penis in your vagina?
Wow, what a great audience. I just flew into South Park. Boy, are my crutches tired!  What a terrific audience. You know, sometimes people ask me, "Are you angry at God for making disabled people?" I say, "No, I think the world is better with puh-President Bush." 
Every student is to go home and vote on their favorite choice in each category. Favorite comedy actor, favorite comedy movie. And then on Friday, during lunch and recess, we're gonna have a big, f-f-f-fantastic comedy awards show.
...and a par-tridge in a... p...pear t...t...tree. On the third day of C...Chrihhh...Chriiii...
Sorry Mims, I I just can't remember it.
P- Principal Victoria, can you explain how your administration fuh-failed to see this p-p-pro-o-o... p-p-problem.
She's apparently gotten real good with baking cakes with keys in them. 
But where am I going to find a lady to stick my penis in? The talent show is this Friday.
From the n-n- from the nn-, from the nn-
Woohoo! Alright!  Oh boy, what a terrific audience. Can I get a wuhwuhwuh what? What?  We're here today to honor those who t-t-tirelessly work so hard to make us laugh. The first comedy award we are presenting is for the funniest kid in school. And the nominees are: 
Do you know where they meet? We've already tried the rec center and the library.
Look it's really none of your b-b-b-beeswax, Timmy!
Lies! These are all a bunch of lies!  Now you listen here, El, Pollo Loco! It doesn't matter if your wife was killed, you cannot keep Irene's aborted baby!
Welcome... to the special ed department's... first annual comedy awards.
That'd be great! I've always wanted to work with you. You're really funny and you're totally not fat.
Oh, sure. I'll see if it fits.  This is very warm. Thanks a lot, Tim-Tim. Well, I'll see you around. 
I have no problem taking the test. I have nothing to hi-huhiii-hide
Uh, I think we're gonna try your authentic pizzareli casserona poppers.
All right! Everyone together! Are we gonna beat Red Team this year?
Wow, w-we've got to do something, Timmy. We've gotta get the Crips and Bloods to sstop fighting. I bet if we could just get them together... but how? Wu-wait a minute! I've got it! A lock-in at the rec center! We did it for our church once. All we do is rent out the rec center overnight. They lock the doors so nobody can leave, and then everyone has the whole night to play in the swimming pool and laugh and talk.
Well, he didn't actually... write any of it. He just uh...
Excuse me, Funnybot. My name is Jimmy, and I'm a stand-up comic. You're putting a lot of good people out of work.
Wow, what a terrific audience. So apparently it's been exactly two years since the fall of Baghdad. Have you seen this? Have you heard about this? Just as B-Bush predicted, Baghdad fell, Iraq fell, Saddam fell. The only thing that didn't fall was ...the price of gas.  I just read in the paper that China's protesting Japan. Have you seen this? Have you heard about this? Yeah, I guess in China you don't get to-  You've gotta be kidding me.
I'm glad we're best friends now. See ya at Scouts. 
If you get in a pinch, go through, it's a cinch-
Thanks for the ride home, fellas. We sure had a ...terrific time.
Yeah! Fuck yeah!  Yeah, I did it! I'm the b-bub-best!  '
Just hangin' out. What are you up to?
You get all the Crips you can to the rec center tomorrow night, Timmy. And I'll try to get all the ...Bloods there.
Yeah, I love when Morgan Freeman explains stuff.
I have had it with those loud, annoying, f-f-f f-faggots.
Well, sir, we believe that the 1% should be dropped from the fitness results, so that our scores can be more accurate.
Well, Eric, th-that's really not how jokes work. I mean, you know, we should just be... happy that the joke is so popular and made a lot of people laugh.
Well, Kenny deserves to know, fellas. If you guys found out my girlfriend was a raging whore, I'd want you to t-tell me.
She just- w-walked away, Stan. You're gonna have to face facts. It's over. 
Wendy said she'd be here an hour before school starts. See you in the morning, ch-ch-ch-champ! 
Ohhhh nothin'. It's just that... y-you might wanna invest in some hedge clippers. 
Oh hey Eric. Just workin' on some jokes.
On the fifth... day... day of... Christmas,  ...my t-true love gave to... uh... me. Five g-g-g... golden ruh-ring... rings.  Fuhgom... don... t-t... don... four cal...ling buh-irr
Aahhm, I don't know, Eric. I really don't think I want to sign that very much.
I know this stuff is hard to understand. Trust me, I know. I'm an addict too. But I got help.
And that's all for Super School News. Enjoy your day at South Park Eh-Eh-Eh-Eh- &gt; Ehehehehe  Eh-Elementary. /&gt;
It's a- v- validation of all your efforts. An acknowledgement of all you do in the pursuit of humor.
Six geese are laying... fu...five go-oldenh ...uhrings. Fodom... dom... du...du...t...du... Four calling biiirds
Oh, hey Timmy. I'm glad you called, very much. I've been detecting some a-animosity towards me lately, and I was hoping we could bury the hatchet.
Thanks a lot, fellas. Well, we gotta get down to the training center and start working out. Word is we have a lot of sssstiff competition this year.
Eh but I want a PS4, not a crappy XBox.
Yeah. Where the hell have you guys ...been?
That's a... fantastic idea fellas. Uh, the key to successful humor is s-staying power. Uh, tell me the first mascot idea.
Wow, seems like you know a lot about this stuff, Eric. Have you gotten laid before?
Fellas! Do you have any idea how difficult comedy is? Can't we just spend one lunch and recess saying thanks to those who make us smile and laugh every day?
Gee, thanks a lot. See you next time.
So I made up my mind that I've just got to find the Tardicaca girl I did adore.
Wow, this is the greatest day of my life. Thanks everyone, for this incredible award.
Why don't we at least give it a chance? I mean,  Come on! 
More snow for South P... P-P-Park. Here's Token Black with the weather.
Oh, uh, wow, that is very interesting. Please tell me more.
I'm trying to write jokes. But I'm not as funny as you, so it's tough.
This isn't the news, this is a tr-tr-tr-tr-travesty.
So, when your penis becomes hard, you're supposed to put in in a lady's vagina. And then it stops being hard?
Well of couse I wanna get laid. That's why I'm taking you to this ...fancy place and pretending to be interested in what you have to say..
Jesus Eric, he's gonna kill you! You won't even admit it was just me, knowing you're gonna die?
Sorry Eric, but I've gotta write some jokes. Unless you wanna team up or somethin'.
They took it back to the video s... the video s...
Ahb. A fireman and a p-p-Polack are eating marshmallows when-
Sure, come on up here, Tim-Tim.  Timmy, ladies and gentlemen. Let's give him a hand, very much. Come to think of it, give him a pair of legs, too.  Here, Timmy, put on this silly hat.  Just for a second, Timmy.  Don't be a jerk, Timmy.  Hey, don't push me!
Well, the best thing is not to act nice, Eric. Uh, the best thing is to be genuinely nice.
Well gee, that's really nice of you, Mr. ...Chinese person.  Look Tim-Tim, we got a cash prize. We must be the ...one hundredth customer or something.
What are you doing here, El, El Pollo Loco?
Not much. I just wanted to make sure you heard the fuh-fantastic news. There's a new Terrance & Phillip mobile game, and it's so amazing and incredibly fun.
Well, hello, Eric. I was really glad you called me, very much.
Eugh! Stay on him! I'm not giving up! 
What?  Hey wait a minute! This is crazy! You can't do this!
Yes, I do have a problem, as a matter of fact! I've spent all my money on this ho, and she's now my only shot at getting laid, and the talent show is only a couple of hours from being over.
Nathan, your team put up an amazing fight. And even though I was crowned the King of Cripple Camp, I want you to know that you were the real ch-cha, champ.
Wow, I've never thought of it that way before, but you're right.
Why sure fellas.  Anyway, be sure to check it out, kid.
Sir! I paid for that lady, and by taking her, you are no better than a common th-thief!
Don't worry, everybody. I've spared no expense to make my comedy awards the biggest thing this school has ever seen. You're all gonna have a blast. 
Well, that sure was a terrific time. Let's go all around tomorrow and show everyone our new outfits, Timmy.
Well, sure, Eric. W-w-what seems to be the p-p-p-prrroblem?
...and the winner for best comedy performance in a movie is...  Ben Stiller! Come on up here, Ben.  Is Ben Stiller here?  No? Huh... I guess B-ben Stiller could not be with us, so I'll accept this award on his behalf.  And the award for funniest correspondents dinner speech goes to...  President Obama!  Is President Obama here? No? Ah I guess we'll just accept this award on his behalf.
Don't worry, fellas. I learned my lesson. I promise: there's not gonna be any comedy awards next year!
The Games are in two days, Nancy. I can't be w-wasting my time.
That video could have been made by Sauron's evil f-...forces.
It's called a lock-in at the rec center. We can use all the rec center facilities. We can play basketball, go swimming, or even just kick it in the lounge area with some games and ...p-puzzles.
Fellas, are you sure all of this ie-eh-ethical?
Well jumpin' Jesus, what are we wasting our time here for then? The talent show is happening right now! Let's get to r-r-rammin'! 
Alright, h-here it goes. On the first day of C-...c...c.. chrih.. stmas my tr... t-tru-true love g-geh... g-g-geh... gave... to... m..m-m-m...m-mm-m-m... me... a pa... a pa... pah...
Well, let us tell you a little bit about ourselves. Timmy and I are both true Crips, born and raised. We're the only Crips in South Park, where we live, and we would love to join your fa-fa-fabtasitc Denver chapter.
This is authentic Italian food straight from S-Sicily. You should try the Lotsa Mozzarella Pizza Roll.
Come on. We have to take the bus to Five Points in Denver.
Well, Timmy, I guess we learned an important lesson, too, very much. There is room for more than one handi-capable person in Scouts.
Come on in, everybody. Lots of su-surprises and t-treats inside.  Great to see you all. What a terrific audience.
Oh wow, this is so exciting, isn't it?  And the winner is...  Oh my God! Jimmy Valmer! I can't believe I w- won! 
Turhr... Ohokahay. Okay, now let's wait ten seconds.  Okay now, t-tell me the first one again?
I said, shut your mouth, bitch! Why did you make me do it, huh?!  You're not leavin' anybody! You just keep your G-Goddamned mouth shut and do what you're t-t-t-uh-tol-told!  '
You you aren't gonna... tell anybody, are you?
Welcome to S-super School News. I'm Jimmy Valmer.
Timmy, don't make me k... kick you ass!
Uhhh, just uh ahh not right this second, Mr. Mackey.
Timmy? Timmy? I told you to put on the HAT!!  You dirty motherfucker! 
Wha, what, what's the m-matter, f-fellas? Are you ... nnnninjas or p-p-p-pussies?
You can check the freezer. There might be some frozen fishsticks or somethin', if you like fishsticks. 
Sorry Eric, but I really need to work, very much. I haven't written a good joke in over a week.
Right. Because you and Mom used to make fun of crippled kids in high school.
How about Jimmy Stewart? "Merry Christmas, movie house." And John Travolta. "Oh my God, Mr. Kotter! Mr. Kotter, oh, oh my God, Mr. Kotter!"
Hey, j-j-jackass!  I'm sorry I resorted to calling you jackass just now, but I'm very upset!
Yeh. Let's go bi- pick on him! Yeh! 
Eric, I can't tell you why, but it's very important that I score to-night! Can you come on the date and help me? You're like a white... Hitch.
Really? M-maybe I can catch the bus ...and get down there before the talent show ends. Th-thanks, Officer Barbrady! 
Fellas, this is our chance! Everyone get your hair looking as fantastic as possible. It's time for us to do the most incredible investigative news report of our journalistic lives!
Why do you think freemium games send you those text notifications when you haven't played in a while? It's called a trigger. A quick image to trigger the addict's brain. They know exactly what they're doing.
I agree. I mean, it's like  "come on"! Why do these people who become crippled later in life think they're such great pot-potatuhs?
Hey Stan, did you see Clyde's going out with Lisa B-b-Berger?
I needed the money, alright?!  I downloaded Yum Yum Sparkly Gem Forest because it was free. I love the sparkly little gems. The sounds they made when I got new ones. Then I made my first in-app purchase. Before I knew it I had spent my allowance, then my birthday money, I LOST my CRUTCHES!
I just think it's a fabulous app, that's all.
Okay. Try this one on for size: Why did the... pigeon cross the road?
Look, Sir Stan, it's probably time to give this up.
Wow, thanks Mom.  You might have saved my life.
Stay away from me, you stupid b-b-b-bitches!  No! God!  '
Oh, it's okay. We're Crips ourselves. Come on, Tim-Tim.
Down like a clown, Charlie Br... Down like a clown, Charlie B-broooowww... Down like a clown, Charlie Browh... Bro-uh-own. Down like a clown, Charlie Br-Brown. 
You have to forfeit the fight, Rad Russian! You cannot fight until your test results come ba-back
Oh! Hey Kyle!  Kyle, hang on a sec. 
Yeah! Yeah!  Yeah, I did it!  Yeah! Yeah! '
We just have one question before we join your c-club. Do you think it's better to be born a Crip, or to become a Crip later by accident?
They are coming.  You guys go on ahead.
There's some chocolates and lih-licorice, and some games and peh- pencils inside.
Just old junk, and boxes of Eric's mom's d-dildos
This is an outrage! Who out there is saying that our friend Stan is a liar?
Wow, looks like when it comes to comedy, I really t-take the c-keh-c. I really take the cay. I really take the k-keh cake. 
Hey, Craig. Have you checked out the Internet lately? 
In her... va-vagina.  Thank you, thank you. What a terrific audience.
With her naughty little wiggle. I know someday
Son of a ...b-bitch!  Taxi!  Follow that pimp and ho! 
It's always been my dream to go on a national TV show and talk about the c-c-craft of comedy.
Ya yo you can't, you can't do that.
... Gee, you didn't have to do that. I mean, I understand why you've been jealous of my talent.  If you work at it, maybe you could be as... handi-capable as I am, huh?  Wow, a parka.  You-you didn't have to do that, Tim-Tim.
The national news? Oh my gosh! People do care! 
Yeah. Yeah, I'm real excited. REAL excited... for some reason... Oh, Jesus! What's wrong with me?
Well, you know, I mean, I basically wrote the thing, and you just kind of ate chips.
Go? We still have over fifty awards to hand out.
Fellas, can I have a moment with Stan, please?
Please, I wasn't starting rumors about you. I don't even know who you are.
Timmy and I made a ...T-shirt design for our new club.  We just came up with a name this morning. 
Hey, what's the matter, Kyle? You seem b-b-bu-bbbummed out.
Yeah! And the most unbelievable part? It's totally free. You should download it to your phone right now. I mean, come. On. If it's free, why wouldn't you?
Out on the beach with my cute little peach where the waves are rolling in so highHolding her hand, our feet on the sand-
...You didn't see the new Indiana Jones movie?
Hey fellas.  You should come downstairs. Stan's mom made pa-pizza.
Don't lecture me on the complexities of sportsmanship. You know as well as I do most of the kids in Special Olympics aren't shooting up to compete. I'm just trying to k-keep up.
Oh I sure have. I've been working on my ruh... ruh... routine all year long
I'm trying to get laid. What's it look like?
Hello? Hello? I need to put my ...p-penis in a woman's vagina. Any takers?  Excuse me, ma'am. What's your name?
Yes, you certainly are. And for doing that, we have all decided to give you... a comedy award.
To be in our club, not only do you have to be c-c-crippled, but you have to have been born that way. Do you know what that means? No butthole Superman asswipe Christopher Reeve!
You did a great job in the 500, Timmy. You're really im-p-p-proving.
Not really. You're just a hooker, and I need to get laid. The talent show could be over any minute.
Martha Stewart is out of jail. Have you seen this? Have you heard about this?
I beg to differ with you, sir. I paid for her and took her out to dinner. She's my ho!
Well, like, try this one on for size: Knock knock.
No need to worry about me. I'm cool like a fool in a swimming ppp-ppp-pp-pp-pool. 
Oh, I'm so glad you think so, Shawna, because I really wanna stick my penis in your vagina.
Oh, well, sure. I've never really tried working with a partner, but let's give it a sho- a sh- a-sh, a-sh, shotaroosky. Let's see... I was workin' on this: Why does a squirrel swim on its back? To keep his -nuts dry.
Because I, maybe I don't have what it takes to win with-without them!
You're not leaving me! You try to leave me and I'll kill you, bitch!
I guess we all learned that trying to get along is way better than p... player hatin'.  The gang wrote a song about it. Why don't we listen in?
But if he's 1% of 17%, then he's .17%.
Timmy and I are competing in a variety of events.
Oh boy, Timmy, it's our favorite time of year.
Get close to him!  How much do I owe you?
Nobody cared about my standup comedy! All that hard work just to be outshined by C-Christopher Reeve the super b-butthole!
C-C-Cartman's army is getting bigger every day. In addition to the Federation and the kindergartners, the XBox army now also has the kids who play Harry Potter, the jocks, the swim team, and the glee club.
Wow, these guys really are crippled.  Timmy, I have a feeling that this is the start of something b-b-b-b...b-b-brilliant.
Duh-n, don't worry fellas. Everything's gonna be okay.
Well, Eric, pah part of being nice is just making people smile and laugh. The best way to do that is by telling a fan-tastic joke or a humorous anti-d- ant'duhh ...anecdote.
Oh my God! That's it! Fellas, get me a Ken doll and some Scotch tape.  Funnybot, I've been talking it over with the fellas and actually, we think what you're doing is genius.
S-s-s-so what are you gonna do now, huh?! You gonna be a fuckin' narc and show that b-bottle to the... coaches?!  Don't think you're any better than me, Timmy! I'm just living in the real world!  Fuck!
Well, I did Ecstasy once.  Me and my girlfriend took it and we stayed up all night having... sex. 
Now look, I know that I've put every comedian in the world out of work, but you have to admit that in a lot of ways, the first annual Comedy Awards was a success.
