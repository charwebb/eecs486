Why are you doing this?! This isn't your usual MO, Chaos!
Please escort the Coon out of our secret base.
Only an immortal can kill another immortal!  Here's your prize! Take this curse away from me, you big pussy!
I assume you must be Cartman, because you're fat.
Pretty cool?! Do you know what it feels like to be stabbed?! To be shot?! Decapitated?! Torn apart?! Burned?! Run over?!
I don't know, but... I feel like... I've... been here before. 
Because it pisses Cartman off beyond belief, and I find that  extremely funny.
And what about Cthulhu's power? Why can't Old Ones die?
Whoever did this to our base was looking for something.
To the sunken city of R'Lyeh fallen from the stars!  You little fucking prick! What is wrong with you?! What kind of sick fuck does that to his friends?!
People need you, Hindsight!  Without you they feel helpless and stupid.
I'm going to try to get you all out of here. If this works. Or, I could be wrong. 
I can't die.  I've experienced death, countless times. Sometimes I see a bright light. Sometimes I see heaven. Or hell. But eventually, no matter what, I wake up in my bed, wearing my same old clothes.  And the worst part? Nobody even remembers me dying. I go to school the next day, and everyone is just like, "Oh hey Kenny." Even if they had seen me get decapitated with their own eyes.  You wanna whine about curses, Hindsight? You're talking to the wrong fucking cowboy.
Alright, you guys hide as long as you can. I'll try and find help. 
He means we need to discuss things with you!
Who cares if a hero doesn't want to be part of Coon and Friends?
Maybe, but with any luck I might find the reason for my powers.
You think your power's a curse?! Let me tell you something about curses, buttlicker!  Because there's some superpowers that make yours look like nothing! Trust me, I know.
We all have a say in this organization, Coon! Let Mosquito talk!
You guys have no memory of me shooting myself in the head, do you?
Aw, I don't wanna tell him. TupperWear, you tell him!
I cannot be unmasked, for then I would stop being a symbol. I need help. Somebody who can do background checks for me, do some investigating.
You guys go! I'll deal with this prick!
How about you find another little girl to pick on?
Sometimes, people do stupid things. Sometimes they don't realize what should have come first. Until it's too late.
I cannot stand here and make idle conversation any longer. The city needs my help. There are innocents to protect. 
I don't find that hard to believe at all.
You are not alone. No matter where you go, no matter what you do, I will always be here! Do you understand?
Uhh, what?  What the fuck?! I m-I mean,  Uh, I mean, what the fuck?! 
You are the bad guy, fat boy! YOU!
Kyle hates Eric Cartman. Are you saying you're Eric Cartman?
No! Come back! I have to know what I am! Come back!
I don't have time for this.  Fireworks are illegal in Colorado, you asshole!  Hey, he's got fireworks!
It's not pretty cool, Kyle! It fuckin' hurts! And it won't go away, and nobody will believe me!  Remember this time! Try and fuckin' remember! 
What we need to do is talk to people in that cult! I wanna know where my powers come from.
Karen McCormick is off limits! Do you understand?! Make sure everybody in this school knows! 
No, it's true. As long as my identity is a mystery, this will just happen again and again. It has to end. I will show my face. 
That god you pray to just took away all my friends.
This city needs my help. It cries for protection and I will-
I knew there'd be no point in telling you guys.
I am Mysterion. Though only nine years old, I dedicate my life to helping people - when I'm not in school.  For months now I've been protecting my town from crime. But now, something has happened that even I cannot fight alone.  The BP Oil Company has drilled and caused a spill in the Gulf like no other. The President of BP apologized.
Then do it!  Pull the trigger, Hindsight! If you don't believe us then you don't have a choice! Pull the trigger, you pussy!
Like last night, in the alley, the cult leader stabbed me and I bled all over the place! And you screamed "Oh my God," and you called him a bastard!
You are going to be okay, Karen! You have to keep believing that!
Yeah. I'm tired, guys. I think I'm gonna go to bed. 
Citizens, tonight has shown me I have no choice but to unmask myself.
What should I do?  Should I forget about the past and not care about my powers?
All the time! I die all the time! And you assholes NEVER REMEMBER!
You're going to tell me everything you know!
Those people down there need help! Sometimes being a hero means helping in smaller ways.
No! This is what superheroes do!  You banished me but I'm back! What does that make me?!  Bring back my friends! Take me!
What does it mean? "That is not dead which can eternal lie"?
I could no longer sit by and watch as my city became a cesspool of crime.  I have lived in South Park all my life. I decided it was up to me to keep this town safe.  Nobody at school knows my double life. To them, I'm just another fourth grader. But tonight, I am Mysterion. 
Creatures from that dimension are now wreaking havoc in the Gulf. BP tried to solve the problem by drilling on the moon, but instead they caused the dark lord Cthulhu to emerge.
Makes sense. Unrelenting despair and a thousand years of darkness sounds pretty goth.
I don't know, but I think we'd better find out.
Will you guys listen to me?! I actually have a power that I actually want to know about!
For you! You're making it a better place for you!
Look, all we need to do is wait for the next disaster, then try to beat Hindsight to the scene.
That's it! That's the place I just was!
Well you don't! I die over. And over! Only to wake up in my bed like nothing happened!
But they drilled again, and tore open a portal into another dimension.
But we get the headquarters and all the equipment.
Ten years ago you were arrested for being in some kind of cult.
There's some graffiti on the bridge again. I think those sixth grade kids are doing it. And the guy at the movie theater is harassing Mexicans again.
We've already discussed this with her. Mrs. Cartman? 
Yes. But now I believe someone is trying to learn my true identity.
Because I think you are the smartest kid in class. 
I might be Craig, and then again I might not be. My identity must remain a secret. You cannot know.
Hindsight, that isn't Courtney Love! Our former member, the Coon, tricked you!
