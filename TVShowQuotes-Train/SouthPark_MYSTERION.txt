I don't know, but I think we'd better find out.
I can't die.  I've experienced death, countless times. Sometimes I see a bright light. Sometimes I see heaven. Or hell. But eventually, no matter what, I wake up in my bed, wearing my same old clothes.  And the worst part? Nobody even remembers me dying. I go to school the next day, and everyone is just like, "Oh hey Kenny." Even if they had seen me get decapitated with their own eyes.  You wanna whine about curses, Hindsight? You're talking to the wrong fucking cowboy.
My God! Another oil spill could mean absolute devastation for the Gulf!
Will you guys listen to me?! I actually have a power that I actually want to know about!
I might be Craig, and then again I might not be. My identity must remain a secret. You cannot know.
Citizens, tonight has shown me I have no choice but to unmask myself.
But we get the headquarters and all the equipment.
Creatures from that dimension are now wreaking havoc in the Gulf. BP tried to solve the problem by drilling on the moon, but instead they caused the dark lord Cthulhu to emerge.
There's some graffiti on the bridge again. I think those sixth grade kids are doing it. And the guy at the movie theater is harassing Mexicans again.
I am Mysterion. Though only nine years old, I dedicate my life to helping people - when I'm not in school.  For months now I've been protecting my town from crime. But now, something has happened that even I cannot fight alone.  The BP Oil Company has drilled and caused a spill in the Gulf like no other. The President of BP apologized.
That god you pray to just took away all my friends.
No! This is what superheroes do!  You banished me but I'm back! What does that make me?!  Bring back my friends! Take me!
Maybe, but with any luck I might find the reason for my powers.
I don't have time for this.  Fireworks are illegal in Colorado, you asshole!  Hey, he's got fireworks!
But they drilled again, and tore open a portal into another dimension.
Only an immortal can kill another immortal!  Here's your prize! Take this curse away from me, you big pussy!
You guys have no memory of me shooting myself in the head, do you?
Ten years ago you were arrested for being in some kind of cult.
And what about Cthulhu's power? Why can't Old Ones die?
Please escort the Coon out of our secret base.
Whoever did this to our base was looking for something.
What should I do?  Should I forget about the past and not care about my powers?
Karen McCormick is off limits! Do you understand?! Make sure everybody in this school knows! 
This city needs my help. It cries for protection and I will-
What does it mean? "That is not dead which can eternal lie"?
You're going to tell me everything you know!
I cannot stand here and make idle conversation any longer. The city needs my help. There are innocents to protect. 
Like last night, in the alley, the cult leader stabbed me and I bled all over the place! And you screamed "Oh my God," and you called him a bastard!
All the time! I die all the time! And you assholes NEVER REMEMBER!
I'm going to try to get you all out of here. If this works. Or, I could be wrong. 
No, Stan, I'm being serious! I really, really can't die!
You are the bad guy, fat boy! YOU!
Sometimes, people do stupid things. Sometimes they don't realize what should have come first. Until it's too late.
Who cares if a hero doesn't want to be part of Coon and Friends?
I knew there'd be no point in telling you guys.
Well you don't! I die over. And over! Only to wake up in my bed like nothing happened!
Why are you doing this?! This isn't your usual MO, Chaos!
Kyle hates Eric Cartman. Are you saying you're Eric Cartman?
You are going to be okay, Karen! You have to keep believing that!
You think your power's a curse?! Let me tell you something about curses, buttlicker!  Because there's some superpowers that make yours look like nothing! Trust me, I know.
What we need to do is talk to people in that cult! I wanna know where my powers come from.
You guys go! I'll deal with this prick!
Because it pisses Cartman off beyond belief, and I find that  extremely funny.
People need you, Hindsight!  Without you they feel helpless and stupid.
I could no longer sit by and watch as my city became a cesspool of crime.  I have lived in South Park all my life. I decided it was up to me to keep this town safe.  Nobody at school knows my double life. To them, I'm just another fourth grader. But tonight, I am Mysterion. 
Yes. But now I believe someone is trying to learn my true identity.
We've already discussed this with her. Mrs. Cartman? 
Hindsight, that isn't Courtney Love! Our former member, the Coon, tricked you!
I have joined forces with other superheroes in my neighborhood to help save the Gulf. But even the other heroes do not know that unlike them, I do have a power. A power they will now begin to understand. And all will know who and what I truly am! 
How about you find another little girl to pick on?
Alright, you guys hide as long as you can. I'll try and find help. 
Those people down there need help! Sometimes being a hero means helping in smaller ways.
Yeah. I'm tired, guys. I think I'm gonna go to bed. 
There must be clubs like this all over the world.
Aw, I don't wanna tell him. TupperWear, you tell him!
You are not alone. No matter where you go, no matter what you do, I will always be here! Do you understand?
So these people have been waiting for Cthulhu a long time.
To the sunken city of R'Lyeh fallen from the stars!  You little fucking prick! What is wrong with you?! What kind of sick fuck does that to his friends?!
I cannot be unmasked, for then I would stop being a symbol. I need help. Somebody who can do background checks for me, do some investigating.
No! Come back! I have to know what I am! Come back!
That's it! That's the place I just was!
Uhh, what?  What the fuck?! I m-I mean,  Uh, I mean, what the fuck?! 
I assume you must be Cartman, because you're fat.
Pretty cool?! Do you know what it feels like to be stabbed?! To be shot?! Decapitated?! Torn apart?! Burned?! Run over?!
I don't find that hard to believe at all.
It's not pretty cool, Kyle! It fuckin' hurts! And it won't go away, and nobody will believe me!  Remember this time! Try and fuckin' remember! 
Do not be afraid. I mean you no harm.
Then do it!  Pull the trigger, Hindsight! If you don't believe us then you don't have a choice! Pull the trigger, you pussy!
Go on! Kill me before I kill you! But bring my friends back, wuss!
No, it's true. As long as my identity is a mystery, this will just happen again and again. It has to end. I will show my face.
