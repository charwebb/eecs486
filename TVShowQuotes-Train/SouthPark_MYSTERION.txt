I have joined forces with other superheroes in my neighborhood to help save the Gulf. But even the other heroes do not know that unlike them, I do have a power. A power they will now begin to understand. And all will know who and what I truly am! 
You guys have no memory of me shooting myself in the head, do you?
Pretty cool?! Do you know what it feels like to be stabbed?! To be shot?! Decapitated?! Torn apart?! Burned?! Run over?!
Creatures from that dimension are now wreaking havoc in the Gulf. BP tried to solve the problem by drilling on the moon, but instead they caused the dark lord Cthulhu to emerge.
I can't die.  I've experienced death, countless times. Sometimes I see a bright light. Sometimes I see heaven. Or hell. But eventually, no matter what, I wake up in my bed, wearing my same old clothes.  And the worst part? Nobody even remembers me dying. I go to school the next day, and everyone is just like, "Oh hey Kenny." Even if they had seen me get decapitated with their own eyes.  You wanna whine about curses, Hindsight? You're talking to the wrong fucking cowboy.
Look, all we need to do is wait for the next disaster, then try to beat Hindsight to the scene.
Only an immortal can kill another immortal!  Here's your prize! Take this curse away from me, you big pussy!
There's some graffiti on the bridge again. I think those sixth grade kids are doing it. And the guy at the movie theater is harassing Mexicans again.
Hindsight, that isn't Courtney Love! Our former member, the Coon, tricked you!
Yes. But now I believe someone is trying to learn my true identity.
What does it mean? "That is not dead which can eternal lie"?
You are the bad guy, fat boy! YOU!
And what about Cthulhu's power? Why can't Old Ones die?
This city needs my help. It cries for protection and I will-
I don't find that hard to believe at all.
Yeah. I'm tired, guys. I think I'm gonna go to bed. 
I'm going to try to get you all out of here. If this works. Or, I could be wrong. 
Why are you doing this?! This isn't your usual MO, Chaos!
Because I think you are the smartest kid in class. 
Like last night, in the alley, the cult leader stabbed me and I bled all over the place! And you screamed "Oh my God," and you called him a bastard!
Because it pisses Cartman off beyond belief, and I find that  extremely funny.
Makes sense. Unrelenting despair and a thousand years of darkness sounds pretty goth.
Aw, I don't wanna tell him. TupperWear, you tell him!
But we get the headquarters and all the equipment.
Do not be afraid. I mean you no harm.
Will you guys listen to me?! I actually have a power that I actually want to know about!
No! Come back! I have to know what I am! Come back!
I cannot be unmasked, for then I would stop being a symbol. I need help. Somebody who can do background checks for me, do some investigating.
You are not alone. No matter where you go, no matter what you do, I will always be here! Do you understand?
We all have a say in this organization, Coon! Let Mosquito talk!
It's not pretty cool, Kyle! It fuckin' hurts! And it won't go away, and nobody will believe me!  Remember this time! Try and fuckin' remember! 
Who cares if a hero doesn't want to be part of Coon and Friends?
That's it! That's the place I just was!
Citizens, tonight has shown me I have no choice but to unmask myself.
I assume you must be Cartman, because you're fat.
Go on! Kill me before I kill you! But bring my friends back, wuss!
For you! You're making it a better place for you!
All the time! I die all the time! And you assholes NEVER REMEMBER!
I might be Craig, and then again I might not be. My identity must remain a secret. You cannot know.
Whoever did this to our base was looking for something.
How about you find another little girl to pick on?
I don't know, but I think we'd better find out.
My God! Another oil spill could mean absolute devastation for the Gulf!
You're going to tell me everything you know!
Karen McCormick is off limits! Do you understand?! Make sure everybody in this school knows! 
I cannot stand here and make idle conversation any longer. The city needs my help. There are innocents to protect. 
I knew there'd be no point in telling you guys.
To the sunken city of R'Lyeh fallen from the stars!  You little fucking prick! What is wrong with you?! What kind of sick fuck does that to his friends?!
You guys go! I'll deal with this prick!
But they drilled again, and tore open a portal into another dimension.
Kyle hates Eric Cartman. Are you saying you're Eric Cartman?
No, Stan, I'm being serious! I really, really can't die!
I could no longer sit by and watch as my city became a cesspool of crime.  I have lived in South Park all my life. I decided it was up to me to keep this town safe.  Nobody at school knows my double life. To them, I'm just another fourth grader. But tonight, I am Mysterion. 
I don't have time for this.  Fireworks are illegal in Colorado, you asshole!  Hey, he's got fireworks!
People need you, Hindsight!  Without you they feel helpless and stupid.
Alright, you guys hide as long as you can. I'll try and find help. 
No, it's true. As long as my identity is a mystery, this will just happen again and again. It has to end. I will show my face. 
So these people have been waiting for Cthulhu a long time.
Well you don't! I die over. And over! Only to wake up in my bed like nothing happened!
There must be clubs like this all over the world.
We've already discussed this with her. Mrs. Cartman? 
Those people down there need help! Sometimes being a hero means helping in smaller ways.
No! This is what superheroes do!  You banished me but I'm back! What does that make me?!  Bring back my friends! Take me!
Please escort the Coon out of our secret base.
I am Mysterion. Though only nine years old, I dedicate my life to helping people - when I'm not in school.  For months now I've been protecting my town from crime. But now, something has happened that even I cannot fight alone.  The BP Oil Company has drilled and caused a spill in the Gulf like no other. The President of BP apologized.
That god you pray to just took away all my friends.
What we need to do is talk to people in that cult! I wanna know where my powers come from.
You think your power's a curse?! Let me tell you something about curses, buttlicker!  Because there's some superpowers that make yours look like nothing! Trust me, I know.
He means we need to discuss things with you!
I don't know, but... I feel like... I've... been here before.
