Like last night, in the alley, the cult leader stabbed me and I bled all over the place! And you screamed "Oh my God," and you called him a bastard!

How about you find another little girl to pick on?

Look, all we need to do is wait for the next disaster, then try to beat Hindsight to the scene.

Because I think you are the smartest kid in class. 

Because it pisses Cartman off beyond belief, and I find that  extremely funny.

But they drilled again, and tore open a portal into another dimension.

It's not pretty cool, Kyle! It fuckin' hurts! And it won't go away, and nobody will believe me!  Remember this time! Try and fuckin' remember! 

What should I do?  Should I forget about the past and not care about my powers?

Sometimes, people do stupid things. Sometimes they don't realize what should have come first. Until it's too late.

I can't die.  I've experienced death, countless times. Sometimes I see a bright light. Sometimes I see heaven. Or hell. But eventually, no matter what, I wake up in my bed, wearing my same old clothes.  And the worst part? Nobody even remembers me dying. I go to school the next day, and everyone is just like, "Oh hey Kenny." Even if they had seen me get decapitated with their own eyes.  You wanna whine about curses, Hindsight? You're talking to the wrong fucking cowboy.

Kyle hates Eric Cartman. Are you saying you're Eric Cartman?

My God! Another oil spill could mean absolute devastation for the Gulf!

I am Mysterion. Though only nine years old, I dedicate my life to helping people - when I'm not in school.  For months now I've been protecting my town from crime. But now, something has happened that even I cannot fight alone.  The BP Oil Company has drilled and caused a spill in the Gulf like no other. The President of BP apologized.

I cannot be unmasked, for then I would stop being a symbol. I need help. Somebody who can do background checks for me, do some investigating.

This city needs my help. It cries for protection and I will-

For you! You're making it a better place for you!

Go on! Kill me before I kill you! But bring my friends back, wuss!

Why are you doing this?! This isn't your usual MO, Chaos!

You guys go! I'll deal with this prick!

All the time! I die all the time! And you assholes NEVER REMEMBER!

You think your power's a curse?! Let me tell you something about curses, buttlicker!  Because there's some superpowers that make yours look like nothing! Trust me, I know.

You are not alone. No matter where you go, no matter what you do, I will always be here! Do you understand?

Only an immortal can kill another immortal!  Here's your prize! Take this curse away from me, you big pussy!

Creatures from that dimension are now wreaking havoc in the Gulf. BP tried to solve the problem by drilling on the moon, but instead they caused the dark lord Cthulhu to emerge.

And what about Cthulhu's power? Why can't Old Ones die?

No, it's true. As long as my identity is a mystery, this will just happen again and again. It has to end. I will show my face. 

Whoever did this to our base was looking for something.

Who cares if a hero doesn't want to be part of Coon and Friends?

He means we need to discuss things with you!

Maybe, but with any luck I might find the reason for my powers.

Please escort the Coon out of our secret base.

I don't have time for this.  Fireworks are illegal in Colorado, you asshole!  Hey, he's got fireworks!

Alright, you guys hide as long as you can. I'll try and find help. 

No, Stan, I'm being serious! I really, really can't die!

But we get the headquarters and all the equipment.

So these people have been waiting for Cthulhu a long time.

Citizens, tonight has shown me I have no choice but to unmask myself.

I could no longer sit by and watch as my city became a cesspool of crime.  I have lived in South Park all my life. I decided it was up to me to keep this town safe.  Nobody at school knows my double life. To them, I'm just another fourth grader. But tonight, I am Mysterion. 

We've already discussed this with her. Mrs. Cartman? 

We all have a say in this organization, Coon! Let Mosquito talk!

What we need to do is talk to people in that cult! I wanna know where my powers come from.

I might be Craig, and then again I might not be. My identity must remain a secret. You cannot know.

I don't know, but I think we'd better find out.

You are going to be okay, Karen! You have to keep believing that!

That's it! That's the place I just was!

That god you pray to just took away all my friends.

I don't find that hard to believe at all.

What does it mean? "That is not dead which can eternal lie"?

Pretty cool?! Do you know what it feels like to be stabbed?! To be shot?! Decapitated?! Torn apart?! Burned?! Run over?!

Makes sense. Unrelenting despair and a thousand years of darkness sounds pretty goth.

There must be clubs like this all over the world.

Will you guys listen to me?! I actually have a power that I actually want to know about!

People need you, Hindsight!  Without you they feel helpless and stupid.

Then do it!  Pull the trigger, Hindsight! If you don't believe us then you don't have a choice! Pull the trigger, you pussy!

I'm going to try to get you all out of here. If this works. Or, I could be wrong. 

Yeah. I'm tired, guys. I think I'm gonna go to bed. 

Yes. But now I believe someone is trying to learn my true identity.

No! This is what superheroes do!  You banished me but I'm back! What does that make me?!  Bring back my friends! Take me!

Well you don't! I die over. And over! Only to wake up in my bed like nothing happened!

Aw, I don't wanna tell him. TupperWear, you tell him!

To the sunken city of R'Lyeh fallen from the stars!  You little fucking prick! What is wrong with you?! What kind of sick fuck does that to his friends?!

You are the bad guy, fat boy! YOU!

I assume you must be Cartman, because you're fat.

I cannot stand here and make idle conversation any longer. The city needs my help. There are innocents to protect. 

There's some graffiti on the bridge again. I think those sixth grade kids are doing it. And the guy at the movie theater is harassing Mexicans again.

Do not be afraid. I mean you no harm.

Those people down there need help! Sometimes being a hero means helping in smaller ways.

Hindsight, that isn't Courtney Love! Our former member, the Coon, tricked you!

I have joined forces with other superheroes in my neighborhood to help save the Gulf. But even the other heroes do not know that unlike them, I do have a power. A power they will now begin to understand. And all will know who and what I truly am! 

Ten years ago you were arrested for being in some kind of cult.
