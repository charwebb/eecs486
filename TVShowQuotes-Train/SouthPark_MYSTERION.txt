We all have a say in this organization, Coon! Let Mosquito talk!

You're going to tell me everything you know!

Don't try, Karen. Do. 

To the sunken city of R'Lyeh fallen from the stars!  You little fucking prick! What is wrong with you?! What kind of sick fuck does that to his friends?!

People need you, Hindsight!  Without you they feel helpless and stupid.

Aw, I don't wanna tell him. TupperWear, you tell him!

You don't understand!

Hindsight, that isn't Courtney Love! Our former member, the Coon, tricked you!

Sometimes, people do stupid things. Sometimes they don't realize what should have come first. Until it's too late.

We believe that every little bit helps.

Those people down there need help! Sometimes being a hero means helping in smaller ways.

Not Cartman.

You guys go! I'll deal with this prick!

Maybe, but with any luck I might find the reason for my powers.

For you! You're making it a better place for you!

All the time! I die all the time! And you assholes NEVER REMEMBER!

There's some graffiti on the bridge again. I think those sixth grade kids are doing it. And the guy at the movie theater is harassing Mexicans again.

Whoever did this to our base was looking for something.

How do I fight him?!

I'm going to try to get you all out of here. If this works. Or, I could be wrong. 

What we need to do is talk to people in that cult! I wanna know where my powers come from.

Wherever Cthulhu is!

Because it pisses Cartman off beyond belief, and I find that  extremely funny.

Hello Kyle.

I knew there'd be no point in telling you guys.

What does it mean? "That is not dead which can eternal lie"?

Kyle hates Eric Cartman. Are you saying you're Eric Cartman?

Maybe I should just... disappear.

Yes. But now I believe someone is trying to learn my true identity.

What next time?

Chaos! Why did you take those pictures?!

Will you guys listen to me?! I actually have a power that I actually want to know about!

Citizens, tonight has shown me I have no choice but to unmask myself.

Mysterion!

Because I think you are the smartest kid in class. 

Like last night, in the alley, the cult leader stabbed me and I bled all over the place! And you screamed "Oh my God," and you called him a bastard!

I could no longer sit by and watch as my city became a cesspool of crime.  I have lived in South Park all my life. I decided it was up to me to keep this town safe.  Nobody at school knows my double life. To them, I'm just another fourth grader. But tonight, I am Mysterion. 

Creatures from that dimension are now wreaking havoc in the Gulf. BP tried to solve the problem by drilling on the moon, but instead they caused the dark lord Cthulhu to emerge.

What happened at those meetings?

I can't die!

Hey, fat boy!

How about you find another little girl to pick on?

No! This is what superheroes do!  You banished me but I'm back! What does that make me?!  Bring back my friends! Take me!

That god you pray to just took away all my friends.

That's it! That's the place I just was!

Ow! That fucking HURTS! 

I don't find that hard to believe at all.

My God! Another oil spill could mean absolute devastation for the Gulf!

Uhh, what?  What the fuck?! I m-I mean,  Uh, I mean, what the fuck?! 

You are going to be okay, Karen! You have to keep believing that!

I'm not here about that.

Mysterion. What is the Cult of Cthulhu?! 

What should I do?  Should I forget about the past and not care about my powers?

Agreed.

Makes sense. Unrelenting despair and a thousand years of darkness sounds pretty goth.

But they drilled again, and tore open a portal into another dimension.

Well you don't! I die over. And over! Only to wake up in my bed like nothing happened!

Who cares if a hero doesn't want to be part of Coon and Friends?

I am Mysterion. Though only nine years old, I dedicate my life to helping people - when I'm not in school.  For months now I've been protecting my town from crime. But now, something has happened that even I cannot fight alone.  The BP Oil Company has drilled and caused a spill in the Gulf like no other. The President of BP apologized.

There must be clubs like this all over the world.

Please escort the Coon out of our secret base.

No! Come back! I have to know what I am! Come back!

No, it's true. As long as my identity is a mystery, this will just happen again and again. It has to end. I will show my face. 

Only an immortal can kill another immortal!  Here's your prize! Take this curse away from me, you big pussy!

I can't die.  I've experienced death, countless times. Sometimes I see a bright light. Sometimes I see heaven. Or hell. But eventually, no matter what, I wake up in my bed, wearing my same old clothes.  And the worst part? Nobody even remembers me dying. I go to school the next day, and everyone is just like, "Oh hey Kenny." Even if they had seen me get decapitated with their own eyes.  You wanna whine about curses, Hindsight? You're talking to the wrong fucking cowboy.

I cannot stand here and make idle conversation any longer. The city needs my help. There are innocents to protect. 

I have joined forces with other superheroes in my neighborhood to help save the Gulf. But even the other heroes do not know that unlike them, I do have a power. A power they will now begin to understand. And all will know who and what I truly am! 

You think your power's a curse?! Let me tell you something about curses, buttlicker!  Because there's some superpowers that make yours look like nothing! Trust me, I know.

Then do it!  Pull the trigger, Hindsight! If you don't believe us then you don't have a choice! Pull the trigger, you pussy!

Pretty cool?! Do you know what it feels like to be stabbed?! To be shot?! Decapitated?! Torn apart?! Burned?! Run over?!

We've already discussed this with her. Mrs. Cartman? 

What are you doing with that thing?!

I assume you must be Cartman, because you're fat.

These people still meet? Where?

You are the bad guy, fat boy! YOU!

Karen McCormick is off limits! Do you understand?! Make sure everybody in this school knows! 

Do not be afraid. I mean you no harm.

I really don't care who you are.

No, Stan, I'm being serious! I really, really can't die!

One Ones?

Yeah. I'm tired, guys. I think I'm gonna go to bed. 

I don't know, but... I feel like... I've... been here before. 

Alright, you guys hide as long as you can. I'll try and find help. 

Ten years ago you were arrested for being in some kind of cult.

I don't have time for this.  Fireworks are illegal in Colorado, you asshole!  Hey, he's got fireworks!

I said it's fine! Just go! 

What does it mean?!

I cannot be unmasked, for then I would stop being a symbol. I need help. Somebody who can do background checks for me, do some investigating.

Please sir, put down the gun.

Why are you doing this?! This isn't your usual MO, Chaos!

I might be Craig, and then again I might not be. My identity must remain a secret. You cannot know.

I don't know, but I think we'd better find out.

And what about Cthulhu's power? Why can't Old Ones die?

Thank you, ma'am.

He means we need to discuss things with you!

I'm fine.
