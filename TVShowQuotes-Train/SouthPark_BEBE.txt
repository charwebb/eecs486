I want to know if I'm gonna live in a big mansion in the future.

Water, Helen, Water.

Can we maybe try one without Lisa Berger?

Oh, uh, forty-eight?

Please, you have to help me. I think that if my breasts keep growing this way, boys will give me whatever I want.

The pioneers met with the Indians, and negotiated for their fertile lands. 

I know. They've been there all day. 

Yeah, and you're flat! 

Okay, okay. My turn, do me now!

Wow, Paris Hilton is at my party! I rule!

Bebe!

Wendy, get a clue. The only thing more important than being rich is being famous!

Pass this up.

Uh. Listen guys, uh, It's five-thirty. I'm supposed to get home, so... I'll see you later. 

Don't you hurt my fucking dog!

Oh Mom, it's just... My girlfriends at school said some really mean things to me today.  They called me a slut, with a huge gaping vagina.

Oh what? So farts are hysterical but queefs are gross?

I cannot by Sparkle Law move to have an old list investigated. However, if you can find recourse for such an inquiry, Wendy, I would review it. Does that sparkle with all the girls?

Why not? Britney Spears got fake ones when she was a teenager. Why can't I have mine taken off?

Don't you guys still wanna play "Truth or Dare"?

Who wants to go first?

Having boobs sucks.

Sorry Wendy. You're just not a whore. Get lost!

I remember when I was a little girl the boys didn't think I was very smart at all. But then one day, they all started thinking I was really smart. I guess big smarts just run in our family.

Thanks, Annie! 

MOM!! MOM!!

Okay, Stan. Truth or Dare?  Stan, Truth or Dare?

Sure, what?

Now here's what I'm talking about.  A little midnight blue!

Paris Hilton is making an appearance at the mall!

Wow, I guess Paris isn't such hot shit after all.

My breasts!

Let me assure you that no list is made hastily by this committee!

Come on! It's time for the fight!

Hey guys.

What?!

Yeah! You have a bad self-image, Wendy! You need to go down to the gym and get a better one!

Hey Wendy, how's your egg doing?

Really?  I've never done that before.

Did it work?

Right. My boobs just clouded your judgment.

Come on, Wendy.

Why would you tell me this? Why would you tell anyone this?

What are you gonna do?!

But, I, I don't know if I want to. Sometimes I think I'm not as smart and cool as they say, that everyone just tells me I am because of my hooters.

Eww!

Kiss him and get it out of your system.

Ever since I got these stupid things everyone treats me differently. I feel like I might be treated differently the rest of my life.

All we're asking is that you do for us what you did for Lisa and help with our imperfections.

Me, too. I wanna get a lawyer.

Aw gee, she's really upset.

Wendy breaks up.

Our slide!

Nichole loves Kyle! Nichole and Kyle sittin' in a tree.

Oh... Okay. 

Oh boy, I never meant to cause all this trouble.

"My cat Thumper."

I've got three.

Blue.

Wow, look at that ass! Shake it, baby!

Okay. It's my turn. Stan? Truth or Dare?

It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.

What did you do, Wendy?! Go rat on us because you're not invited to our Paris Hilton party?!

Hey guys.

I heard she has tentacles and eats children for lunch.

She's gonna fight! Wendy's gonna fight Cartman right now!

She just doesn't wanna be with you anymore. She said she still wants to be friends. 

"Thumper is twelve years old. That's pretty old for a cat. The end."

Well if the girls don't wanna be my friend, that's fine!  Guys are way cooler, anyways.

Wow, that's really her! Paris! Over here!

Can we try this without Wendy?

Wow.  Wendy and Cartman are gonna fight after school!

Oh, cool.

You guys are so immature! Act like eight-year olds!

Well whether you wanted to or not doesn't really matter now! We're going to get graded together! It's your egg too! Own up to your responsibilities! 

Hey guys. 

I can't believe they're this upset.

I hope so Wendy. He's got such a hot ass.

Alright, look. When two people work closely for a long time, sometimes they feel what's called, "sexual tension." Sometimes you just have to act on impulse and get it over with.

Please. Just remember the good times we had. I'll never forget you. Never.  Okay, Clyde, we can go now.

Mom, why is everyone acting so different around me?

Hey Bridon, can we watch you practice basketball?

You're not even spoiled, because your parents give money to charity!

Yuh huh! If you don't wear a condom, you're gonna get AIDS.

This is insane!

Really?

They're here! The audition results for the school musical are in! 

Stan, why don't you show her you love her? If you really want Wendy back, try doing the most romantic thing you can think of.

Shut up!

Come on Wendy, kick his ass!

Yes!

No, it's a little strap.

Bebe!

Is somebody in there?! I'll tell on you!

I want a Starvin' Marvin.

Today's list meeting is called to order. Rebecca, you have the floor.

Wendy, we're sorry we called you names. Like not-stupid and not-spoiled.

We could play "girl talk." 

Oh please, you're lying. 

All right, all right, come before the Rainbow Railing. 

...You guys still wanna go ice-skating after school?

That's not for boys to look at! It's a secret girl list and YOU can't see it!

As long as we care about each other we can still have some fun.

Stan, this is our egg. We're both supposed to take care of it.

Okay.

Who? Whowhowhowho?

Kyle, can I talk to you?

You suck!

Put the lotion in the basket!

He's already seen High School Musical 3 over a hundred times.

We wouldn't give a rat's ass if Leonardo DiCaprio came walking past us.

Oh yeah? I bet I can spit in his hair. 

Her feathers are beautiful.

Rebecca moves we work on List 47D. Does that sparkle with all the girls?

We'll never walk away. Never! 

Oh, that's okay.  So, Nichole, guess what? One of the boys here already has a crush on you.

Token likes Nichole?

You guys uh,  notice anything different? 

Let's go ice-skating.

Marjorine, we were just teasing. We think you're great.

Okay.

Yeah, we think it's gonna be fun!

You guys, calm down!

Do any of you have your condoms on?

Water, Helen. It has a name. Oh, why can't you understand?

You wouldn't be interested, Wendy. My parents are out of town, so it's a Stupid Spoiled Whore party.

Hello. My name is Anne Sullivan, and I believe I can teach this child to communicate.

It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.

Kyle, could you turn around for a second?  Thank you. 

No, they're conspiring! Mom, they were talking! They wanna destroy the town!

What if we meet a guy who wants to be a doctor or a lawyer, but is still getting his degree?

This is the story of South Park. It begins over a hundred years ago. When the noble and hardy Ute Indians lived on the land.

That does it! I'm NOT letting these things run my life!

Come on, Wendy, we're gonna miss it!

Hey Bridon.

Kick the shit out of him, Wendy!

I think it's insane to want them bigger.

"Thumper is gray with a white spot. Sometimes he likes to chase his tail. 

She did it!

That girl sure has a strange sense of fashion.

No it's not, because if I grow up getting everything I want, having things made easy for me because I have hot knockers, then I'm gonna grow up to be a lame person. If I'm handed everything in life, then my chances of becoming a lawyer or a marine biologist are zero.

Bye, Kenny. See you tomorrow.

Okay, so where's our money?

Yeah.  I wish I had a partner like Kyle! I went to go pick up the egg from Stan yesterday, and his dog had it in its mouth! Our egg isn't gonna last a week with Stan around!

Hey Bridon, how come you weren't at musical rehearsals last night?

God, you're so stupid! 

Let's bring out our mascot and get this pep rally going! 

I wanna have breast-reduction surgery. 

Okay.

Stan, I need you to watch the egg for a while.

That's okay, Wendy. I brought my makeup kit like you asked me. What are we doing, anyway?

Hey Kevin, party at my house.

Take this stick and jam it up your peehole.

Helen, Helen. Water, Helen.

Yeah?

Party at my house tonight, Clyde. You're invited. 

What?

Four.

I'm not...  telling! And anyway, I'm not the list keeper, Nelly is! And Nelly will never let you look at it, so there! 

All right!

As long as we've got each other, we'll never have any trouble.

What??

Thanks for inviting me to ride the bus to school with you guys.

But am I slutty just because I'm beginning to be friends with guys? I mean, they just like me because they think I'm smart and cool.

Stop it you guys, please!

I think a trip to Hawaii would really improve our sex life.

Yeah! Just take your diseases and go away forever!

She's in the bathroom crying. 

Yes. I have two hundred and twelve dollars in nickels and a gold bracelet.

Yeah. If you're too scared to race, just say so!

Party at my house tonight, Kyle.

Are we gonna get paid now, or after?

No, no. Don't speak. Just try and understand. It has to be this way.

We're being stupid spoiled whores. 

I'm just feeling really trapped. I can't go on with this codependency.

Then, from the east, came the great white pioneers. 

And then I saw High School Musical 3 again on Friday, and guess who was there? Bridon Gueermo.

Oh, fuck off! 

Red.

Kyle was simple a casualty! To move Clyde meant that Craig has to be moved to number twelve, which moved Jimmy down and moved Jason up!

Right?

Gross! 

Why sure, that sounds hellafun.

Why?!

If you hadn't gone all Nancy Drew on us, this would have just gone away! 

Where is she? How come Wendy's not showing up for the fight?

Fuck you, fatass! You guys are assholes!

Damnit!

Wendy breaks up with you. 

I've been looking after it all day. I have to go to the hair salon and the candy store!

Yes, that's it.  That's it, Helen. Water! WA-TER!

After a boy in my class tried to put his tongue in my mouth, I knew I needed legal help. Kyle's dad helped me get a $1.6 million settlement, and this bright new shiny bicycle. Thank you, Kyle's dad! 

Bebe!

Water, Helen! Waaa-terr!

Somebody might have lice?

Really?

Uh huh. 

Wait, I, I didn't do anything wrong.

Did you seeee these shoes, Wendy?!  They're incredible!
