Oh Mom, it's just... My girlfriends at school said some really mean things to me today.  They called me a slut, with a huge gaping vagina.
No it's not, because if I grow up getting everything I want, having things made easy for me because I have hot knockers, then I'm gonna grow up to be a lame person. If I'm handed everything in life, then my chances of becoming a lawyer or a marine biologist are zero.
Today's list meeting is called to order. Rebecca, you have the floor.
She's gonna fight! Wendy's gonna fight Cartman right now!
No, they're conspiring! Mom, they were talking! They wanna destroy the town!
I heard she has tentacles and eats children for lunch.
Hello. My name is Anne Sullivan, and I believe I can teach this child to communicate.
That does it! I'm NOT letting these things run my life!
Is somebody in there?! I'll tell on you!
As long as we've got each other, we'll never have any trouble.
Wow, Paris Hilton is at my party! I rule!
It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.
That's not for boys to look at! It's a secret girl list and YOU can't see it!
"Thumper is gray with a white spot. Sometimes he likes to chase his tail. 
Let's just get a magnifying glass and look at everyone's heads.
The pioneers met with the Indians, and negotiated for their fertile lands. 
If you really want a shot at getting her back, stand outside her window, hold a boombox over your head, and play  Peter Gabriel.
Wow, look at that ass! Shake it, baby!
And then I saw High School Musical 3 again on Friday, and guess who was there? Bridon Gueermo.
Yeah, they started coming in last week. At first I thought they were just mosquito bites, but, then they didn't go away.
Why would you tell me this? Why would you tell anyone this?
Where is she? How come Wendy's not showing up for the fight?
I've been looking after it all day. I have to go to the hair salon and the candy store!
As long as we care about each other we can still have some fun.
Kyle was simple a casualty! To move Clyde meant that Craig has to be moved to number twelve, which moved Jimmy down and moved Jason up!
Oh, that's okay.  So, Nichole, guess what? One of the boys here already has a crush on you.
Alright, look. When two people work closely for a long time, sometimes they feel what's called, "sexual tension." Sometimes you just have to act on impulse and get it over with.
"Thumper is twelve years old. That's pretty old for a cat. The end."
You're not even spoiled, because your parents give money to charity!
Kyle, could you turn around for a second?  Thank you. 
That's okay, Wendy. I brought my makeup kit like you asked me. What are we doing, anyway?
Uh. Listen guys, uh, It's five-thirty. I'm supposed to get home, so... I'll see you later. 
I'm not...  telling! And anyway, I'm not the list keeper, Nelly is! And Nelly will never let you look at it, so there! 
You wouldn't be interested, Wendy. My parents are out of town, so it's a Stupid Spoiled Whore party.
Yes, that's it.  That's it, Helen. Water! WA-TER!
All we're asking is that you do for us what you did for Lisa and help with our imperfections.
This is the story of South Park. It begins over a hundred years ago. When the noble and hardy Ute Indians lived on the land.
Nichole loves Kyle! Nichole and Kyle sittin' in a tree.
She just doesn't wanna be with you anymore. She said she still wants to be friends. 
Let me assure you that no list is made hastily by this committee!
Yuh huh! If you don't wear a condom, you're gonna get AIDS.
They're here! The audition results for the school musical are in! 
I'm just feeling really trapped. I can't go on with this codependency.
We wouldn't give a rat's ass if Leonardo DiCaprio came walking past us.
Yeah.  I wish I had a partner like Kyle! I went to go pick up the egg from Stan yesterday, and his dog had it in its mouth! Our egg isn't gonna last a week with Stan around!
Yeah. If you're too scared to race, just say so!
Kiss him and get it out of your system.
Stan, why don't you show her you love her? If you really want Wendy back, try doing the most romantic thing you can think of.
Do any of you have your condoms on?
Ever since I got these stupid things everyone treats me differently. I feel like I might be treated differently the rest of my life.
Wendy, we're sorry we called you names. Like not-stupid and not-spoiled.
Marjorine, we were just teasing. We think you're great.
Well if the girls don't wanna be my friend, that's fine!  Guys are way cooler, anyways.
I want to know if I'm gonna live in a big mansion in the future.
What if we meet a guy who wants to be a doctor or a lawyer, but is still getting his degree?
Can we maybe try one without Lisa Berger?
Sorry Wendy. You're just not a whore. Get lost!
Why not? Britney Spears got fake ones when she was a teenager. Why can't I have mine taken off?
All right, all right, come before the Rainbow Railing. 
Okay. It's my turn. Stan? Truth or Dare?
Oh boy, I never meant to cause all this trouble.
No, no. Don't speak. Just try and understand. It has to be this way.
Please. Just remember the good times we had. I'll never forget you. Never.  Okay, Clyde, we can go now.
Stan, I need you to watch the egg for a while.
Did you seeee these shoes, Wendy?!  They're incredible!
Hey Bridon, how come you weren't at musical rehearsals last night?
Thanks for inviting me to ride the bus to school with you guys.
After a boy in my class tried to put his tongue in my mouth, I knew I needed legal help. Kyle's dad helped me get a $1.6 million settlement, and this bright new shiny bicycle. Thank you, Kyle's dad! 
You guys are so immature! Act like eight-year olds!
If you hadn't gone all Nancy Drew on us, this would have just gone away! 
Water, Helen. It has a name. Oh, why can't you understand?
He's already seen High School Musical 3 over a hundred times.
What did you do, Wendy?! Go rat on us because you're not invited to our Paris Hilton party?!
Oh what? So farts are hysterical but queefs are gross?
Now here's what I'm talking about.  A little midnight blue!
Mom, why is everyone acting so different around me?
Wow, look at all this great stuff. Stupid Spoiled Whore clothes, Stupid Spoiled Whore dolls,
I remember when I was a little girl the boys didn't think I was very smart at all. But then one day, they all started thinking I was really smart. I guess big smarts just run in our family.
But, I, I don't know if I want to. Sometimes I think I'm not as smart and cool as they say, that everyone just tells me I am because of my hooters.
The committee has already decided that nothing with stripes can be in the Top 5 cutest purses.
But am I slutty just because I'm beginning to be friends with guys? I mean, they just like me because they think I'm smart and cool.
Rebecca moves we work on List 47D. Does that sparkle with all the girls?
I hope so Wendy. He's got such a hot ass.
Kyle, this is very difficult for me. I think we need time apart.
Wendy, get a clue. The only thing more important than being rich is being famous!
...You guys still wanna go ice-skating after school?
Party at my house tonight, Clyde. You're invited. 
Oh yeah? I bet I can spit in his hair. 
Wow.  Wendy and Cartman are gonna fight after school!
I think a trip to Hawaii would really improve our sex life.
I cannot by Sparkle Law move to have an old list investigated. However, if you can find recourse for such an inquiry, Wendy, I would review it. Does that sparkle with all the girls?
Then, from the east, came the great white pioneers. 
Okay, Stan. Truth or Dare?  Stan, Truth or Dare?
Yeah! Just take your diseases and go away forever!
Stan, this is our egg. We're both supposed to take care of it.
Yeah! You have a bad self-image, Wendy! You need to go down to the gym and get a better one!
I think us Cows have the best school spirit. Huh, Mandy?
I think it's insane to want them bigger.
Wow, I guess Paris isn't such hot shit after all.
That girl sure has a strange sense of fashion.
Yes. I have two hundred and twelve dollars in nickels and a gold bracelet.
