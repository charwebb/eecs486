Eww!

Don't you hurt my fucking dog!

Yeah, we think it's gonna be fun!

Yeah?

No, they're conspiring! Mom, they were talking! They wanna destroy the town!

Oh, fuck off! 

I think it's insane to want them bigger.

Having boobs sucks.

Kyle, can I talk to you?

Why?!

Wow, look at that ass! Shake it, baby!

Come on, Wendy, we're gonna miss it!

That's okay, Wendy. I brought my makeup kit like you asked me. What are we doing, anyway?

Stop it you guys, please!

Now here's what I'm talking about.  A little midnight blue!

That does it! I'm NOT letting these things run my life!

Helen, Helen. Water, Helen.

Mom?  What's six times eight?

Kyle was simple a casualty! To move Clyde meant that Craig has to be moved to number twelve, which moved Jimmy down and moved Jason up!

The pioneers met with the Indians, and negotiated for their fertile lands. 

Yeah, and you're flat! 

Kyle, this is very difficult for me. I think we need time apart.

Please, you have to help me. I think that if my breasts keep growing this way, boys will give me whatever I want.

Yeah.  I wish I had a partner like Kyle! I went to go pick up the egg from Stan yesterday, and his dog had it in its mouth! Our egg isn't gonna last a week with Stan around!

No it's not, because if I grow up getting everything I want, having things made easy for me because I have hot knockers, then I'm gonna grow up to be a lame person. If I'm handed everything in life, then my chances of becoming a lawyer or a marine biologist are zero.

The committee has already decided that nothing with stripes can be in the Top 5 cutest purses.

Oh, goodie. 

Bebe!

Kick the shit out of him, Wendy!

All right!

It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.

Don't you guys still wanna play "Truth or Dare"?

Well whether you wanted to or not doesn't really matter now! We're going to get graded together! It's your egg too! Own up to your responsibilities! 

Bebe!

If you really want a shot at getting her back, stand outside her window, hold a boombox over your head, and play  Peter Gabriel.

Yeah! You have a bad self-image, Wendy! You need to go down to the gym and get a better one!

Hey guys.

You wouldn't be interested, Wendy. My parents are out of town, so it's a Stupid Spoiled Whore party.

Who? Whowhowhowho?

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!

Alright, look. When two people work closely for a long time, sometimes they feel what's called, "sexual tension." Sometimes you just have to act on impulse and get it over with.

What did you do, Wendy?! Go rat on us because you're not invited to our Paris Hilton party?!

Really?

I think a trip to Hawaii would really improve our sex life.

MOM!! MOM!!

Come on, Wendy.

Okay, okay. My turn, do me now!

Pass this up.

Thanks for inviting me to ride the bus to school with you guys.

Our slide!

I know. They've been there all day. 

We'll never walk away. Never! 

Hey guys.

I'm just feeling really trapped. I can't go on with this codependency.

I want a Starvin' Marvin.

Sorry Wendy. You're just not a whore. Get lost!

Nichole loves Kyle! Nichole and Kyle sittin' in a tree.

Shut up!

This is the story of South Park. It begins over a hundred years ago. When the noble and hardy Ute Indians lived on the land.

All we're asking is that you do for us what you did for Lisa and help with our imperfections.

Today's list meeting is called to order. Rebecca, you have the floor.

Let me assure you that no list is made hastily by this committee!

Oh what? So farts are hysterical but queefs are gross?

Oh yeah? I bet I can spit in his hair. 

I cannot by Sparkle Law move to have an old list investigated. However, if you can find recourse for such an inquiry, Wendy, I would review it. Does that sparkle with all the girls?

Stan, this is our egg. We're both supposed to take care of it.

Wow.  Wendy and Cartman are gonna fight after school!

Right?

She's in the bathroom crying. 

Okay. It's my turn. Stan? Truth or Dare?

Oh Mom, it's just... My girlfriends at school said some really mean things to me today.  They called me a slut, with a huge gaping vagina.

He's already seen High School Musical 3 over a hundred times.

Can we maybe try one without Lisa Berger?

Wendy breaks up with you. 

Yuh huh! If you don't wear a condom, you're gonna get AIDS.

Okay.

Red.

We're being stupid spoiled whores. 

Wendy breaks up.

We could play "girl talk." 

Gross! 

"Thumper is gray with a white spot. Sometimes he likes to chase his tail. 

I hope so Wendy. He's got such a hot ass.

You guys, calm down!

Let's just get a magnifying glass and look at everyone's heads.

She's gonna fight! Wendy's gonna fight Cartman right now!

It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.

I want a pot-bellied elephant.

I remember when I was a little girl the boys didn't think I was very smart at all. But then one day, they all started thinking I was really smart. I guess big smarts just run in our family.

Four.

Hey everybody.

What are you gonna do?!

You're not even spoiled, because your parents give money to charity!

Wow, look at all this great stuff. Stupid Spoiled Whore clothes, Stupid Spoiled Whore dolls,

Sure, what?

Oh, that's okay.  So, Nichole, guess what? One of the boys here already has a crush on you.

You guys uh,  notice anything different? 

...You guys still wanna go ice-skating after school?

I've been looking after it all day. I have to go to the hair salon and the candy store!

Uh huh. 

Hey Bridon, how come you weren't at musical rehearsals last night?

Is somebody in there?! I'll tell on you!

What if we meet a guy who wants to be a doctor or a lawyer, but is still getting his degree?

She did it!

Right. My boobs just clouded your judgment.

As long as we care about each other we can still have some fun.

Yeah. If you're too scared to race, just say so!

Wow, Paris Hilton is at my party! I rule!

Okay.

Wait, I, I didn't do anything wrong.

Yeah! Just take your diseases and go away forever!

Mr. Slave has no idea what he's in for.

Wendy, we're sorry we called you names. Like not-stupid and not-spoiled.

What??

Hey Bridon.

You suck!

Stan, why don't you show her you love her? If you really want Wendy back, try doing the most romantic thing you can think of.

Really?

Ever since I got these stupid things everyone treats me differently. I feel like I might be treated differently the rest of my life.

I've got three.

"My cat Thumper."

Uh. Listen guys, uh, It's five-thirty. I'm supposed to get home, so... I'll see you later. 

And then I saw High School Musical 3 again on Friday, and guess who was there? Bridon Gueermo.

Party at my house tonight, Kyle.

My breasts!

I wanna have breast-reduction surgery. 

Let's go ice-skating.

Wow, I guess Paris isn't such hot shit after all.

I heard she has tentacles and eats children for lunch.

Cool.

Come on! It's time for the fight!

You guys are so immature! Act like eight-year olds!

Water, Helen, Water.

She just doesn't wanna be with you anymore. She said she still wants to be friends. 

No, it's a little strap.

Who wants to go first?

What?!

Wow, that's really her! Paris! Over here!

Where is she? How come Wendy's not showing up for the fight?

Somebody might have lice?

And we have a right to know which boy had lice in his hair so we don't ever go out with them!

Do any of you have your condoms on?

Wendy, get a clue. The only thing more important than being rich is being famous!

They're here! The audition results for the school musical are in! 

Why would you tell me this? Why would you tell anyone this?

Aw gee, she's really upset.

Precious?

Fuck you, fatass! You guys are assholes!

Did you seeee these shoes, Wendy?!  They're incredible!

"Thumper is twelve years old. That's pretty old for a cat. The end."

I can't believe they're this upset.

Okay.

Oh, cool.

But am I slutty just because I'm beginning to be friends with guys? I mean, they just like me because they think I'm smart and cool.

Water, Helen! Waaa-terr!

Hey Kevin, party at my house.

Then, from the east, came the great white pioneers. 

Yes!

I'm not...  telling! And anyway, I'm not the list keeper, Nelly is! And Nelly will never let you look at it, so there! 

Did it work?

Come on Wendy, kick his ass!

Yeah, they started coming in last week. At first I thought they were just mosquito bites, but, then they didn't go away.

Oh, uh, forty-eight?

Rebecca moves we work on List 47D. Does that sparkle with all the girls?

Okay.

Really?  I've never done that before.

Oh... Okay. 

Hey Bridon, can we watch you practice basketball?

Why sure, that sounds hellafun.

Well if the girls don't wanna be my friend, that's fine!  Guys are way cooler, anyways.

Paris Hilton is making an appearance at the mall!

Why not? Britney Spears got fake ones when she was a teenager. Why can't I have mine taken off?

Water, Helen. It has a name. Oh, why can't you understand?

Oh please, you're lying. 

Kyle, could you turn around for a second?  Thank you. 

No, no. Don't speak. Just try and understand. It has to be this way.

Put the lotion in the basket!

Oh boy, I never meant to cause all this trouble.

Stan, I need you to watch the egg for a while.

Bye, Kenny. See you tomorrow.

But, I, I don't know if I want to. Sometimes I think I'm not as smart and cool as they say, that everyone just tells me I am because of my hooters.

Me, too. I wanna get a lawyer.

Mom, why is everyone acting so different around me?

Take this stick and jam it up your peehole.

Okay, so where's our money?

All right, all right, come before the Rainbow Railing. 

Are we gonna get paid now, or after?

Yes. I have two hundred and twelve dollars in nickels and a gold bracelet.

I want to know if I'm gonna live in a big mansion in the future.

This is insane!

Kiss him and get it out of your system.

Blue.

Damnit!

That girl sure has a strange sense of fashion.

Bebe!

Do you think it'll hurt?

As long as we've got each other, we'll never have any trouble.

What?

Hey guys.
