Oh what? So farts are hysterical but queefs are gross?
He's already seen High School Musical 3 over a hundred times.
If you really want a shot at getting her back, stand outside her window, hold a boombox over your head, and play  Peter Gabriel.
Yeah. If you're too scared to race, just say so!
They're here! The audition results for the school musical are in! 
Yeah.  I wish I had a partner like Kyle! I went to go pick up the egg from Stan yesterday, and his dog had it in its mouth! Our egg isn't gonna last a week with Stan around!
No, they're conspiring! Mom, they were talking! They wanna destroy the town!
That does it! I'm NOT letting these things run my life!
I think it's insane to want them bigger.
...You guys still wanna go ice-skating after school?
I think a trip to Hawaii would really improve our sex life.
Yes. I have two hundred and twelve dollars in nickels and a gold bracelet.
It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.
You're not even spoiled, because your parents give money to charity!
She's gonna fight! Wendy's gonna fight Cartman right now!
Oh yeah? I bet I can spit in his hair. 
"Thumper is twelve years old. That's pretty old for a cat. The end."
Today's list meeting is called to order. Rebecca, you have the floor.
Let's bring out our mascot and get this pep rally going! 
You wouldn't be interested, Wendy. My parents are out of town, so it's a Stupid Spoiled Whore party.
Ever since I got these stupid things everyone treats me differently. I feel like I might be treated differently the rest of my life.
You guys are so immature! Act like eight-year olds!
Water, Helen. It has a name. Oh, why can't you understand?
Stan, why don't you show her you love her? If you really want Wendy back, try doing the most romantic thing you can think of.
Why would you tell me this? Why would you tell anyone this?
And then I saw High School Musical 3 again on Friday, and guess who was there? Bridon Gueermo.
As long as we've got each other, we'll never have any trouble.
All we're asking is that you do for us what you did for Lisa and help with our imperfections.
Wow, look at that ass! Shake it, baby!
I remember when I was a little girl the boys didn't think I was very smart at all. But then one day, they all started thinking I was really smart. I guess big smarts just run in our family.
I'm just feeling really trapped. I can't go on with this codependency.
I've been looking after it all day. I have to go to the hair salon and the candy store!
Mom, why is everyone acting so different around me?
Wow.  Wendy and Cartman are gonna fight after school!
Wendy, get a clue. The only thing more important than being rich is being famous!
But am I slutty just because I'm beginning to be friends with guys? I mean, they just like me because they think I'm smart and cool.
And we have a right to know which boy had lice in his hair so we don't ever go out with them!
Is somebody in there?! I'll tell on you!
Oh, that's okay.  So, Nichole, guess what? One of the boys here already has a crush on you.
Let me assure you that no list is made hastily by this committee!
Marjorine, we were just teasing. We think you're great.
I think us Cows have the best school spirit. Huh, Mandy?
But, I, I don't know if I want to. Sometimes I think I'm not as smart and cool as they say, that everyone just tells me I am because of my hooters.
If you hadn't gone all Nancy Drew on us, this would have just gone away! 
Hey Bridon, can we watch you practice basketball?
Please, you have to help me. I think that if my breasts keep growing this way, boys will give me whatever I want.
Now here's what I'm talking about.  A little midnight blue!
That girl sure has a strange sense of fashion.
"Thumper is gray with a white spot. Sometimes he likes to chase his tail. 
I heard she has tentacles and eats children for lunch.
Kyle, this is very difficult for me. I think we need time apart.
Take this stick and jam it up your peehole.
Stan, I need you to watch the egg for a while.
Well if the girls don't wanna be my friend, that's fine!  Guys are way cooler, anyways.
All right, all right, come before the Rainbow Railing. 
Can we maybe try one without Lisa Berger?
Do any of you have your condoms on?
It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.
That's okay, Wendy. I brought my makeup kit like you asked me. What are we doing, anyway?
Paris Hilton is making an appearance at the mall!
What did you do, Wendy?! Go rat on us because you're not invited to our Paris Hilton party?!
Wow, Paris Hilton is at my party! I rule!
Sorry Wendy. You're just not a whore. Get lost!
Nichole loves Kyle! Nichole and Kyle sittin' in a tree.
That's not for boys to look at! It's a secret girl list and YOU can't see it!
No it's not, because if I grow up getting everything I want, having things made easy for me because I have hot knockers, then I'm gonna grow up to be a lame person. If I'm handed everything in life, then my chances of becoming a lawyer or a marine biologist are zero.
What if we meet a guy who wants to be a doctor or a lawyer, but is still getting his degree?
Mr. Slave has no idea what he's in for.
I hope so Wendy. He's got such a hot ass.
Hey Bridon, how come you weren't at musical rehearsals last night?
Kyle, could you turn around for a second?  Thank you. 
Uh. Listen guys, uh, It's five-thirty. I'm supposed to get home, so... I'll see you later. 
Hello. My name is Anne Sullivan, and I believe I can teach this child to communicate.
Kiss him and get it out of your system.
No, no. Don't speak. Just try and understand. It has to be this way.
Oh boy, I never meant to cause all this trouble.
Please. Just remember the good times we had. I'll never forget you. Never.  Okay, Clyde, we can go now.
Okay, Stan. Truth or Dare?  Stan, Truth or Dare?
Rebecca moves we work on List 47D. Does that sparkle with all the girls?
Well whether you wanted to or not doesn't really matter now! We're going to get graded together! It's your egg too! Own up to your responsibilities! 
Yuh huh! If you don't wear a condom, you're gonna get AIDS.
I want to know if I'm gonna live in a big mansion in the future.
Yeah! Just take your diseases and go away forever!
Then, from the east, came the great white pioneers. 
The committee has already decided that nothing with stripes can be in the Top 5 cutest purses.
Wow, look at all this great stuff. Stupid Spoiled Whore clothes, Stupid Spoiled Whore dolls,
I'm not...  telling! And anyway, I'm not the list keeper, Nelly is! And Nelly will never let you look at it, so there! 
Did you seeee these shoes, Wendy?!  They're incredible!
Thanks for inviting me to ride the bus to school with you guys.
Stan, this is our egg. We're both supposed to take care of it.
Yes, that's it.  That's it, Helen. Water! WA-TER!
We wouldn't give a rat's ass if Leonardo DiCaprio came walking past us.
Party at my house tonight, Clyde. You're invited. 
Don't you guys still wanna play "Truth or Dare"?
Yeah! You have a bad self-image, Wendy! You need to go down to the gym and get a better one!
The pioneers met with the Indians, and negotiated for their fertile lands. 
After a boy in my class tried to put his tongue in my mouth, I knew I needed legal help. Kyle's dad helped me get a $1.6 million settlement, and this bright new shiny bicycle. Thank you, Kyle's dad! 
Are we gonna get paid now, or after?
Kyle was simple a casualty! To move Clyde meant that Craig has to be moved to number twelve, which moved Jimmy down and moved Jason up!
Where is she? How come Wendy's not showing up for the fight?
This is the story of South Park. It begins over a hundred years ago. When the noble and hardy Ute Indians lived on the land.
