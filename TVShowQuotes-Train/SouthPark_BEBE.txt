Please, you have to help me. I think that if my breasts keep growing this way, boys will give me whatever I want.
It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.
Kyle was simple a casualty! To move Clyde meant that Craig has to be moved to number twelve, which moved Jimmy down and moved Jason up!
Yeah! You have a bad self-image, Wendy! You need to go down to the gym and get a better one!
Yeah, they started coming in last week. At first I thought they were just mosquito bites, but, then they didn't go away.
Kyle, could you turn around for a second?  Thank you. 
No, no. Don't speak. Just try and understand. It has to be this way.
That girl sure has a strange sense of fashion.
Oh Mom, it's just... My girlfriends at school said some really mean things to me today.  They called me a slut, with a huge gaping vagina.
Stan, why don't you show her you love her? If you really want Wendy back, try doing the most romantic thing you can think of.
This is the story of South Park. It begins over a hundred years ago. When the noble and hardy Ute Indians lived on the land.
Why would you tell me this? Why would you tell anyone this?
Party at my house tonight, Clyde. You're invited. 
I hope so Wendy. He's got such a hot ass.
Rebecca moves we work on List 47D. Does that sparkle with all the girls?
Then, from the east, came the great white pioneers. 
Let me assure you that no list is made hastily by this committee!
Wow, look at all this great stuff. Stupid Spoiled Whore clothes, Stupid Spoiled Whore dolls,
You wouldn't be interested, Wendy. My parents are out of town, so it's a Stupid Spoiled Whore party.
Stan, I need you to watch the egg for a while.
Paris Hilton is making an appearance at the mall!
No it's not, because if I grow up getting everything I want, having things made easy for me because I have hot knockers, then I'm gonna grow up to be a lame person. If I'm handed everything in life, then my chances of becoming a lawyer or a marine biologist are zero.
Kiss him and get it out of your system.
Do any of you have your condoms on?
Nichole loves Kyle! Nichole and Kyle sittin' in a tree.
Wow, look at that ass! Shake it, baby!
If you hadn't gone all Nancy Drew on us, this would have just gone away! 
Well if the girls don't wanna be my friend, that's fine!  Guys are way cooler, anyways.
I heard she has tentacles and eats children for lunch.
Okay. It's my turn. Stan? Truth or Dare?
They're here! The audition results for the school musical are in! 
You're not even spoiled, because your parents give money to charity!
Now here's what I'm talking about.  A little midnight blue!
I think it's insane to want them bigger.
Please. Just remember the good times we had. I'll never forget you. Never.  Okay, Clyde, we can go now.
Can we maybe try one without Lisa Berger?
If you really want a shot at getting her back, stand outside her window, hold a boombox over your head, and play  Peter Gabriel.
"Thumper is twelve years old. That's pretty old for a cat. The end."
Ever since I got these stupid things everyone treats me differently. I feel like I might be treated differently the rest of my life.
As long as we care about each other we can still have some fun.
It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.
Wow, Paris Hilton is at my party! I rule!
Oh, that's okay.  So, Nichole, guess what? One of the boys here already has a crush on you.
Oh boy, I never meant to cause all this trouble.
Hey Bridon, can we watch you practice basketball?
Let's just get a magnifying glass and look at everyone's heads.
Today's list meeting is called to order. Rebecca, you have the floor.
That does it! I'm NOT letting these things run my life!
And we have a right to know which boy had lice in his hair so we don't ever go out with them!
Thanks for inviting me to ride the bus to school with you guys.
Wow, I guess Paris isn't such hot shit after all.
He's already seen High School Musical 3 over a hundred times.
She just doesn't wanna be with you anymore. She said she still wants to be friends. 
As long as we've got each other, we'll never have any trouble.
Yuh huh! If you don't wear a condom, you're gonna get AIDS.
I cannot by Sparkle Law move to have an old list investigated. However, if you can find recourse for such an inquiry, Wendy, I would review it. Does that sparkle with all the girls?
Oh what? So farts are hysterical but queefs are gross?
Oh yeah? I bet I can spit in his hair. 
Water, Helen. It has a name. Oh, why can't you understand?
What did you do, Wendy?! Go rat on us because you're not invited to our Paris Hilton party?!
I'm just feeling really trapped. I can't go on with this codependency.
Wendy, we're sorry we called you names. Like not-stupid and not-spoiled.
I'm not...  telling! And anyway, I'm not the list keeper, Nelly is! And Nelly will never let you look at it, so there! 
Yes. I have two hundred and twelve dollars in nickels and a gold bracelet.
Uh. Listen guys, uh, It's five-thirty. I'm supposed to get home, so... I'll see you later. 
Wendy, get a clue. The only thing more important than being rich is being famous!
Mom, why is everyone acting so different around me?
No, they're conspiring! Mom, they were talking! They wanna destroy the town!
Yeah. If you're too scared to race, just say so!
...You guys still wanna go ice-skating after school?
Alright, look. When two people work closely for a long time, sometimes they feel what's called, "sexual tension." Sometimes you just have to act on impulse and get it over with.
"Thumper is gray with a white spot. Sometimes he likes to chase his tail. 
I think a trip to Hawaii would really improve our sex life.
The committee has already decided that nothing with stripes can be in the Top 5 cutest purses.
The pioneers met with the Indians, and negotiated for their fertile lands. 
Kyle, this is very difficult for me. I think we need time apart.
Yeah! Just take your diseases and go away forever!
Don't you guys still wanna play "Truth or Dare"?
Wow.  Wendy and Cartman are gonna fight after school!
That's not for boys to look at! It's a secret girl list and YOU can't see it!
Okay, Stan. Truth or Dare?  Stan, Truth or Dare?
Mr. Slave has no idea what he's in for.
Yeah.  I wish I had a partner like Kyle! I went to go pick up the egg from Stan yesterday, and his dog had it in its mouth! Our egg isn't gonna last a week with Stan around!
Hello. My name is Anne Sullivan, and I believe I can teach this child to communicate.
Did you seeee these shoes, Wendy?!  They're incredible!
Well whether you wanted to or not doesn't really matter now! We're going to get graded together! It's your egg too! Own up to your responsibilities! 
Hey Bridon, how come you weren't at musical rehearsals last night?
Yes, that's it.  That's it, Helen. Water! WA-TER!
All we're asking is that you do for us what you did for Lisa and help with our imperfections.
What if we meet a guy who wants to be a doctor or a lawyer, but is still getting his degree?
You guys are so immature! Act like eight-year olds!
Are we gonna get paid now, or after?
But, I, I don't know if I want to. Sometimes I think I'm not as smart and cool as they say, that everyone just tells me I am because of my hooters.
But am I slutty just because I'm beginning to be friends with guys? I mean, they just like me because they think I'm smart and cool.
Take this stick and jam it up your peehole.
That's okay, Wendy. I brought my makeup kit like you asked me. What are we doing, anyway?
Sorry Wendy. You're just not a whore. Get lost!
Where is she? How come Wendy's not showing up for the fight?
Let's bring out our mascot and get this pep rally going! 
And then I saw High School Musical 3 again on Friday, and guess who was there? Bridon Gueermo.
I think us Cows have the best school spirit. Huh, Mandy?
