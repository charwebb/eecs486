Wendy.
What's going on?
Bye Jerry.
Elaine?
Yeah. I hope my clients weren't too upset.
Hi/Hey.
Oh sure. You have insurance, right?
Yes.
Well, I'll see you guys later. (to George) Nice meeting you. Bye Elaine.
I mean, why don't you two just take your business elsewhere, hmm?
(taking the bottle) Ah.
(flattered) Oh. Thank you. I actually was thinking it might be time for a change.

Right. It's only three blocks.
A delicate genius?
Let me give you my card.

Oh, hi Jerry.

Yeah. Does he have a girlfriend?
Well, I'm sorry, that's our policy.
Hey/Hi/Hello (etc.)
(smiling) I'm sorry, I don't owe you anything. I had some personal business that day.
(laughs, flattered) Oh, ho.
Oh, well.
How did you hear that?
Well, why not?
(holds out her hand) Hi.
Well, I...
Have you tried heat and ice on it?
I'm dropping you off.
Yeah, but if I take you to your door, then I have to go all the way around Central Park West, back to Columbus, you know it's all one way...
So, who's that friend of yours? That guy that came in.
