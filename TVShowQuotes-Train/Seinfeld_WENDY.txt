(holds out her hand) Hi.
Have you tried heat and ice on it?
I mean, why don't you two just take your business elsewhere, hmm?
Well, I...
Let me give you my card.
(taking the bottle) Ah.
Wendy.
Hi/Hey.
Oh, well.
Yeah. Does he have a girlfriend?
(smiling) I'm sorry, I don't owe you anything. I had some personal business that day.
(laughs, flattered) Oh, ho.
Well, I'm sorry, that's our policy.
Yes.
How did you hear that?
Well, I'll see you guys later. (to George) Nice meeting you. Bye Elaine.
Right. It's only three blocks.
What, is there anything wrong with him?
Oh sure. You have insurance, right?
Oh, hi Jerry.
I'm dropping you off.
Oh, okay. Oh, your friend George came by the office the other day, and then yesterday he cancelled on me.
Well, why not?
Yeah, but if I take you to your door, then I have to go all the way around Central Park West, back to Columbus, you know it's all one way...
Elaine?
Hey/Hi/Hello (etc.)
Yeah. I hope my clients weren't too upset.
A delicate genius?
Sure.
So, who's that friend of yours? That guy that came in.
Well, you could come by my office later, I could work on it for you a little.
What's going on?
What's the problem?
I am really glad I took the day off.
