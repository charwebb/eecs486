Yeah, but if I take you to your door, then I have to go all the way around Central Park West, back to Columbus, you know it's all one way...
Have you tried heat and ice on it?
Oh, okay. Oh, your friend George came by the office the other day, and then yesterday he cancelled on me.
(flattered) Oh. Thank you. I actually was thinking it might be time for a change.
So, who's that friend of yours? That guy that came in.
I am really glad I took the day off.
Yeah. I hope my clients weren't too upset.
(smiling) I'm sorry, I don't owe you anything. I had some personal business that day.
Well, I'll see you guys later. (to George) Nice meeting you. Bye Elaine.
Well, you could come by my office later, I could work on it for you a little.
