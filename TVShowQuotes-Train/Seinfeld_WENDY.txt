What's going on?
So, who's that friend of yours? That guy that came in.
Well, I'm sorry, that's our policy.
Well, I'll see you guys later. (to George) Nice meeting you. Bye Elaine.
How did you hear that?
(holds out her hand) Hi.
Oh, well.
Why, what's wrong with my hair?
Sure.
Let me give you my card.
Hi/Hey.
Yeah. Does he have a girlfriend?
Bye Jerry.
Well, why not?
Yes.
What's the problem?
Well, I...
Oh, okay. Oh, your friend George came by the office the other day, and then yesterday he cancelled on me.
A delicate genius?
I am really glad I took the day off.
What, is there anything wrong with him?
Well, you could come by my office later, I could work on it for you a little.
Oh sure. You have insurance, right?
Elaine?
(flattered) Oh. Thank you. I actually was thinking it might be time for a change.
(laughs, flattered) Oh, ho.
Wendy.
I'm dropping you off.
I mean, why don't you two just take your business elsewhere, hmm?
(smiling) I'm sorry, I don't owe you anything. I had some personal business that day.
Have you tried heat and ice on it?
Right. It's only three blocks.
Hey/Hi/Hello (etc.)
Oh, hi Jerry.
