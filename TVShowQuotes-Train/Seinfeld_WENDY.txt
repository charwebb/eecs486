Well, I'll see you guys later. (to George) Nice meeting you. Bye Elaine.
Have you tried heat and ice on it?
Well, I...
Why, what's wrong with my hair?
How did you hear that?
I mean, why don't you two just take your business elsewhere, hmm?
What's going on?
Oh, well.
So, who's that friend of yours? That guy that came in.
A delicate genius?
Oh sure. You have insurance, right?
(holds out her hand) Hi.
Well, I'm sorry, that's our policy.
(laughs, flattered) Oh, ho.
Let me give you my card.
Well, you could come by my office later, I could work on it for you a little.
(smiling) I'm sorry, I don't owe you anything. I had some personal business that day.
(taking the bottle) Ah.
Oh, hi Jerry.
Bye Jerry.
Hey/Hi/Hello (etc.)
Yes.
Oh, okay. Oh, your friend George came by the office the other day, and then yesterday he cancelled on me.
What's the problem?
I am really glad I took the day off.
I'm dropping you off.
Well, why not?
Sure.
Yeah. I hope my clients weren't too upset.
Hi/Hey.
Wendy.
Yeah, but if I take you to your door, then I have to go all the way around Central Park West, back to Columbus, you know it's all one way...
(flattered) Oh. Thank you. I actually was thinking it might be time for a change.
Yeah. Does he have a girlfriend?
