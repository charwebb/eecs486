Let me tell you what I think.
Because I have a very radical idea. Can you handle it?
I don't know. He never came back. (Over to the other side of the bar)
Never came back.
Maybe I should get going.
No thanks.
I should be going.
I don't want to have anything to do with you or your perverted friends. (Confused, Elaine moves closer) Ooohh, get away from me! You're horrible.
Yes, I told him all about you going and he got all excited and decided to go.
You know, the apartment.
Remember? That's why you put off doing the closets. You said you were going to Berlin for a while.
George. Jerry, Stacey.
So, I'll see you Saturday night, then?
Contest?! A contest! This is what you do with your friends?
Are you gonna leave after its over? You know, if we have sex.
So they just leave?
Well I wouldn't move in because...
Let's go in the bedroom.
What do you mean?
I don't want to hear another word. And to think how close I came to you being the one! I must have been out of my mind.
You, know my boyfriend went.
Here's what I'm proposing. We eliminate all this. The hangers, the bar, the shelves. And in its place install a series of hooks. We'll put everything on hooks.
Well because I'm a virgin. (Elaine enters)
Yes.
Let's slow it down a little.
John, what are you doing? Come back to bed.
Well what if it was my apartment?
(Walks over to Jerry and George) Jerry.
Ooh, he's horrible! Horrible!
Well Elaine said men like to leave after it's over.
Yes.
I do. I'm ready.
No thanks.
You're okay with that, right?
Yes. (She exits)
Well because...
Alright, then. Good night.
Are you very fussy about your pants?
I'll get some ice.
It was about to end anyway. There was this... problem.
Wow. It must be pretty good to put up with all that.
Ohh, John. That was wonderful..
I know how difficult this must have been for you.
I should be going.
The wall had just come down, and you told me you wanted to be part of the celebration.
