Contest?! A contest! This is what you do with your friends?
Remember? That's why you put off doing the closets. You said you were going to Berlin for a while.
Well Elaine said men like to leave after it's over.
The wall had just come down, and you told me you wanted to be part of the celebration.
I know how difficult this must have been for you.
Because I have a very radical idea. Can you handle it?
John, what are you doing? Come back to bed.
Well, he wanted me to move in with him.
Wow. It must be pretty good to put up with all that.
It was about to end anyway. There was this... problem.
Yes, I told him all about you going and he got all excited and decided to go.
I don't want to hear another word. And to think how close I came to you being the one! I must have been out of my mind.
Well, (Reminding him of her virginity) You know..
I don't know. He never came back. (Over to the other side of the bar)
Are you gonna leave after its over? You know, if we have sex.
Everything. The shirts, pants, sport jackets, pajamas. We could get eighty hooks on here.
Here's what I'm proposing. We eliminate all this. The hangers, the bar, the shelves. And in its place install a series of hooks. We'll put everything on hooks.
