John, what are you doing? Come back to bed.
No thanks.
Well, (Reminding him of her virginity) You know..
Remember? That's why you put off doing the closets. You said you were going to Berlin for a while.
I don't know. He never came back. (Over to the other side of the bar)
Everything. The shirts, pants, sport jackets, pajamas. We could get eighty hooks on here.
Yes. (She exits)
Yes.
You, know my boyfriend went.
Maybe I should get going.
Never came back.
I don't want to have anything to do with you or your perverted friends. (Confused, Elaine moves closer) Ooohh, get away from me! You're horrible.
Yes, I told him all about you going and he got all excited and decided to go.
No thanks.
It was about to end anyway. There was this... problem.
Here's what I'm proposing. We eliminate all this. The hangers, the bar, the shelves. And in its place install a series of hooks. We'll put everything on hooks.
Let's slow it down a little.
Well what if it was my apartment?
Because I have a very radical idea. Can you handle it?
Contest?! A contest! This is what you do with your friends?
Well because I'm a virgin. (Elaine enters)
Are you gonna leave after its over? You know, if we have sex.
Are you very fussy about your pants?
Alright, then. Good night.
I do. I'm ready.
So they just leave?
Wow. It must be pretty good to put up with all that.
Well because...
Ohh, John. That was wonderful..
Well, he wanted me to move in with him.
Let's go in the bedroom.
I know how difficult this must have been for you.
What do you mean?
(Walks over to Jerry and George) Jerry.
Ooh, he's horrible! Horrible!
I should be going.
I'll get some ice.
So, how was your trip to Berlin?
Well Elaine said men like to leave after it's over.
You're okay with that, right?
So, I'll see you Saturday night, then?
You know, the apartment.
Well I wouldn't move in because...
I should be going.
George. Jerry, Stacey.
