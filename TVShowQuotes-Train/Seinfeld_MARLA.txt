Never came back.
I'll get some ice.
What do you mean?
Everything. The shirts, pants, sport jackets, pajamas. We could get eighty hooks on here.
So they just leave?
Wow. It must be pretty good to put up with all that.
Here's what I'm proposing. We eliminate all this. The hangers, the bar, the shelves. And in its place install a series of hooks. We'll put everything on hooks.
Remember? That's why you put off doing the closets. You said you were going to Berlin for a while.
Well Elaine said men like to leave after it's over.
Because I have a very radical idea. Can you handle it?
Well I wouldn't move in because...
So, I'll see you Saturday night, then?
I don't want to hear another word. And to think how close I came to you being the one! I must have been out of my mind.
You know, the apartment.
Let's slow it down a little.
Ooh, he's horrible! Horrible!
I know how difficult this must have been for you.
Yes. (She exits)
George. Jerry, Stacey.
Ohh, John. That was wonderful..
I don't want to have anything to do with you or your perverted friends. (Confused, Elaine moves closer) Ooohh, get away from me! You're horrible.
Maybe I should get going.
I do. I'm ready.
Well, (Reminding him of her virginity) You know..
No thanks.
Yes, I told him all about you going and he got all excited and decided to go.
Well because I'm a virgin. (Elaine enters)
Let me tell you what I think.
Yes.
Well because...
Yes.
Are you very fussy about your pants?
I should be going.
John, what are you doing? Come back to bed.
I should be going.
You, know my boyfriend went.
Are you gonna leave after its over? You know, if we have sex.
Alright, then. Good night.
The wall had just come down, and you told me you wanted to be part of the celebration.
Well what if it was my apartment?
Contest?! A contest! This is what you do with your friends?
(Walks over to Jerry and George) Jerry.
Let's go in the bedroom.
So, how was your trip to Berlin?
No thanks.
