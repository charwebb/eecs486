So, how was your trip to Berlin?
Well what if it was my apartment?
Wow. It must be pretty good to put up with all that.
Are you gonna leave after its over? You know, if we have sex.
The wall had just come down, and you told me you wanted to be part of the celebration.
Alright, then. Good night.
Maybe I should get going.
You know, the apartment.
I don't want to have anything to do with you or your perverted friends. (Confused, Elaine moves closer) Ooohh, get away from me! You're horrible.
It was about to end anyway. There was this... problem.
Let's slow it down a little.
Ooh, he's horrible! Horrible!
Yes, I told him all about you going and he got all excited and decided to go.
Well I wouldn't move in because...
Never came back.
So, I'll see you Saturday night, then?
Well because I'm a virgin. (Elaine enters)
I should be going.
Ohh, John. That was wonderful..
Yes.
Let me tell you what I think.
I'll get some ice.
Let's go in the bedroom.
Yes. (She exits)
No thanks.
(Walks over to Jerry and George) Jerry.
Well, (Reminding him of her virginity) You know..
Are you very fussy about your pants?
Contest?! A contest! This is what you do with your friends?
You, know my boyfriend went.
Well because...
I do. I'm ready.
No thanks.
Well Elaine said men like to leave after it's over.
I don't know. He never came back. (Over to the other side of the bar)
Well, he wanted me to move in with him.
What do you mean?
Everything. The shirts, pants, sport jackets, pajamas. We could get eighty hooks on here.
George. Jerry, Stacey.
You're okay with that, right?
I don't want to hear another word. And to think how close I came to you being the one! I must have been out of my mind.
I know how difficult this must have been for you.
Because I have a very radical idea. Can you handle it?
Here's what I'm proposing. We eliminate all this. The hangers, the bar, the shelves. And in its place install a series of hooks. We'll put everything on hooks.
John, what are you doing? Come back to bed.
