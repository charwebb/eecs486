I don't want to have anything to do with you or your perverted friends. (Confused, Elaine moves closer) Ooohh, get away from me! You're horrible.
Well, (Reminding him of her virginity) You know..
Well, he wanted me to move in with him.
Contest?! A contest! This is what you do with your friends?
John, what are you doing? Come back to bed.
I don't know. He never came back. (Over to the other side of the bar)
I don't want to hear another word. And to think how close I came to you being the one! I must have been out of my mind.
Yes, I told him all about you going and he got all excited and decided to go.
I know how difficult this must have been for you.
Remember? That's why you put off doing the closets. You said you were going to Berlin for a while.
Wow. It must be pretty good to put up with all that.
The wall had just come down, and you told me you wanted to be part of the celebration.
Everything. The shirts, pants, sport jackets, pajamas. We could get eighty hooks on here.
Here's what I'm proposing. We eliminate all this. The hangers, the bar, the shelves. And in its place install a series of hooks. We'll put everything on hooks.
It was about to end anyway. There was this... problem.
Well Elaine said men like to leave after it's over.
Are you gonna leave after its over? You know, if we have sex.
