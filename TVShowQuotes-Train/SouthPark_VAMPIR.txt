We dress the way our souls feel, to express the darkness, per se.
Don't worry, Ma'am. As I was just explaining to my new minions, vampires are actually very spiritual and deep beings, per se.
You know, you guys are really giving off a negative human energy. We prefer to take our darkness somewhere else, per se.
We'll think about it. Go get us some sodas out of the pop machine in the commons.
Then it is time for your transformation, per se. Let it begin!  This way. Prepare thyself. 
Are you sure? Because once you're in South Park Vampire Society, you can't ever leave.
Don't call me Mike, my name is Vampir now.
(No! I'm not really a vampire! I'm not a vam-, I'm not a vampire!)
Okay, let's all be seated please?  This is thee noon meeting of the Vamp kids? I am Mike, your lord and dark master, per se.
And now you shall drink vampire blood, and your transformation will be complete, per se!  With this thy transformation is done. 
Yeah, and then I think it's time for us to feed, per se. 
You have done well. Are you ready to become one of us, per se?
Yeah, I'm more a sanguinarian vampire in that I rely more on the life force energy, per se.
(Please, what do you want?! Let me go!)
That's true, Bloodrayne. People are going to be frightened of us because they don't understand our ways, per se.
...All mortals share a soft repose,
My soul doth dreadful vigils keep,
More keen than which hell scarcely knows.
