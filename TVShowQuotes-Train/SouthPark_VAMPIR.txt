Okay, let's all be seated please?  This is thee noon meeting of the Vamp kids? I am Mike, your lord and dark master, per se.
That's true, Bloodrayne. People are going to be frightened of us because they don't understand our ways, per se.
Yeah, and then I think it's time for us to feed, per se. 
Then it is time for your transformation, per se. Let it begin!  This way. Prepare thyself. 
It is finished! Welcome, Butters, to the South Park Society of Vampires. 
...All mortals share a soft repose,
My soul doth dreadful vigils keep,
More keen than which hell scarcely knows.
(Please, what do you want?! Let me go!)
And now you shall drink vampire blood, and your transformation will be complete, per se!  With this thy transformation is done. 
Don't worry, Ma'am. As I was just explaining to my new minions, vampires are actually very spiritual and deep beings, per se.
You know, you guys are really giving off a negative human energy. We prefer to take our darkness somewhere else, per se.
We'll think about it. Go get us some sodas out of the pop machine in the commons.
Don't call me Mike, my name is Vampir now.
Yeah, I'm more a sanguinarian vampire in that I rely more on the life force energy, per se.
We dress the way our souls feel, to express the darkness, per se.
You have done well. Are you ready to become one of us, per se?
(No! I'm not really a vampire! I'm not a vam-, I'm not a vampire!)
