Oh my God, where is my homework?! I am freaking out! 

I heard the school nurse is hideously deformed.

My paper is called, "Why Bebe is the coolest person, ever."

Yeah Eric, we're gonna stop ignoring you now. 

Apparently, he stopped Microsoft from blockading the shipment of PS4s to the mall. Looks like he's all over the place winning the console wars for Sony.

I just can't believe how yummy these are.

Yeah. They say it's gonna take three weeks to get it all down.

Yeah, we just started dating seriously.  You wanna meet my new girlfriend, Tweek?

But why me, doctor? Why me?! How did I get this?!

Ah, excuse me? My daddy is a geologist and he says there actually isn't any concrete evidence of global warming.

You mean they both have butts instead of heads?

There's no alternative. We have to return the tape before it causes more damage!

Hey, check it out. She's totally staring you down.  She sure seems confident. You should probably go easy on her, dude. You don't wanna put her in the hospital or anything.

Whales are mammals; they don't need water to breathe, dumb-ass.

I totally can't see the fight, dude. I have detention after school.

Okay mom, just not in front of my friends okay?

Sure was better when our parents were buyin' us stuff.

Well we can't keep the whale out here anymore, people are gonna see it!

Hey Token. You know, I never noticed before, but that girl Bebe is... kinda cool.

...We've gotta get to that church before we die.

And so, we must all recycle. Every day. Recycling is important, and it will save our planet, Earth. The End. 

Yeah, and it was called Man from Atlantis, and he had like, webbed fingers... 

And the commercial where the two kids have pot and the one kids shoots the other. Harmless?

Very well. You shall be the Fellowship of The Lord of the Rings. Good luck. I have to go home now before I get in trouble.

That is true. Only a Paladin with a high constitution should watch the tape. Therefore, I think it is a job for you, Talangar the Black.

Put it, put it up on the, monitors! 

Kyle's dad got me 1.4 million, and he can do it for you, too. Just look at all these beautiful girls! 

No it's not! You made me run away to be a pirate and there's not even any treasure!

So then when she sticks her tongue out you just kind of lick it with your tongue.

Yeah, we gotta remember to kick his ass tomorrow. 

So? I have three copies. And the DVD with twelve hours of extra footage.

If it's just looks then I think I'm safe.

But we have a big deal with EA Sports that depends on it.

This is Hawk Eyes. We've set up the net and we're standing by. 

Please just hurry to the park! You have to stop them!

Something's wrong with Chef. He's saying some really weird stuff.

Look, until we see this tape's power for ourselves, we cannot risk giving it to anybody.

Have any of you dumb girls seen Bebe anywhere?

You guys, maybe we should just... wait a few more minutes?

I hate it here and I wanna go home!! 

She hangs out behind the temp building during afternoon recess. She'll kiss any boy that pays her.

You guys! You guuys! We've got some bad news. Slash isn't real. 

Ah, my dog Rex follows me to football practice all the time.

It is too far and too dangerous to go alone. Take with you the wizard , the dwarf , the warrior , the cleric , and the Jew .

He's made up and people dress like him and pretend to be him to their kids.

So I don't get to be on the team now?

This whole thing is stupid! You don't pick people you wanna be with by making it into a game!

Oh. Okay, hang on a second.  What troubles you?

Yeah.  Here, it's like if you put your thumb on this side-

Let's never let boobs come between us again!

Right this way!  You can't eat in the cafeteria! 

Oh, thank you! Thank you for coming back!  Thank you so much. Thank you.

Well I guess we're never gonna know. There's no way to tell.

Hey! Hey, Stan! You're not gonna believe it! You've gotta come see!

There's a guy selling them downtown. But they're not made from recycled plastic.

Uh, how long do you expect the fight to last?

I never realized ignoring him was an option.

Please, ya-you don't understand. The other kids are gonna make fun of me forever!

You wanna know who I hate?! I hate that kid Butters! He's a dork!

And so that is the situation. The video may or may not have evil power. Kyle, would you bring it up here, please? 

Oh my God! What is he doing to my dog?

Ye-you guys, we'd better go. Recess is almost over.

Yeah! But I think it's broke down. The cars aren't moving.

Hey, Kyle. Look man, it doesn't matter what people think, okay?  You know, Abraham Lincoln was pretty ugly too, but look what he accomplished.  Chin up, cowboy.  Hey, what's goin' on? 

Well, we can add music numbers, but how do we make the Helen Keller story more Thanksgivingy?

I think you're a big fat piece of crap.

Well, there's really not that many of us. We figured we should let him join.

The Sony people might not be our biggest problem.

I think...  I think he wants to have sex with me.

"My friend Bebe is really smart. She tells funny jokes and knows a lot about stuff. She's good at almost everything she tries. She's awesome. The end." 

You know, the sequel to High School Musical 1 and 2.

What if we don't know anybody who was in Vietnam?

Here, look for yourself.  He's based on the fable of a Dutch saint named Vunter Slash. 

Ask if the Broncos are gonna win on Sunday.

We're just having a hard time finding him.

Hey yeah, I know.  How about we ask those kids who play Star Trek?

I don't know, that looks pretty high up.

Uh, my bitch is still the hottest, you guys.

Yeah. If we died right now, we'd have unclean souls and we'd burn in hell. 

Yeah, what's the big idea having your mom call all our moms last night?

At least she didn't try to sit on him. 

We've got to get that picture to your mom so that she will come home and save us.

Tonight we present the story of a courageous girl and her fight against depression

There, you see? The girls have built some kind of stronghold to keep us out. 

It's okay, babe. Girls who don't have what you have are always going to put you down. 

I don't know. I got this emergency letter from Cartman that said to meet in his basement. 

Yeah. We need more of your mojo, Butters.

Twitter says they're introducing a new Elmo doll this Christmas.

I don't know, it's just a cool costume.

Butters, that's not cool, man.  He can't help how he looks. 

How come you get to use it first?

You said there was gonna be crystal clear lagoons and treasure and plunderrrr! 

Yeah. Those girls don't realize what good sledders Stan, Kyle, and Kenny are.

Mrs. Garrison, one of your students is about to be attacked at the park by all the other students.

Oppression. Our play begins in a simpler time.  Alabama, in the late 1800s 

We're tryin' to get Bebe to run for class president.

For the last time, I'm not fat, so stop calling me fat, God-damnit! 

Really? Cool.  It's funny, 'cause Tweek and Craig both went home about fifteen minutes ago.

One thing for sure, this tape cannot be trusted with anybody. This must be returned to the video store from whence it came.

Chase his tail? That must be so funny?

All right, hurry! Get it up there! Let's see it!

Naw, Rebecca's just a friend. I wanna be with you now. Sure, yeah, I'll buy you some shoes too.

It's all set. Once we have the device, it can be housed in here safely until we know what we're dealing with.

Hey, Timmy might need some help pulling his pants down.

Hey, I'm not fat, you guys. I'm just kind of big-boned.

What vice did you see on the videotape, Talangar? Is it the work of Sauron's magic? 

Hey, did you guys see Eavesdropper? Pete Melman shit his pants! 

I can't even remember if we're supposed to hug the fullback or compliment him. I'm so confused.

Yeah, just let me show her real quick how to put the thumb and-

Are you guys dumb? We can't beat him, even with all of us. It's a waste of time.

The mall isn't open yet. They're waiting for George R. R. Martin to come cut the ribbon.

That we can go back to being the South Park Cows! 

Tommy stuck his face in the belt sander 

They're gonna finally reveal who Phillip farted on to get out of jail.

You're not supposed to be in the cafeteria.

Why did we agree to that stupid app?!

I wanna go again. I wanna go again!

We must have just missed him. He was playing at Cherry Creek mall and then Flat Irons mall. Now we don't know where to go because Slash is playing the Pavilion in Colorado Springs in the Gigadome in Moscow later this afternoon.

...What if we don't want to be your friend?

Well, we might as well call up Lakewood and tell 'em we forfeit. 

Look, could you guys just not say anything about this in school, please?

I'm not gonna touch it. You throw it away.

Yes, please, Eric. Why are you so cool?

Ha! We cannot trust something of that much power to a dwarf! Especially a kindergartner dwarf. 

Hey, what's goin' on?  What's goin on? Hey.  Oh yeah, hey, whassup? What's goin' on? Nice.
