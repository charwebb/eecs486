You guys! You guuys! We've got some bad news. Slash isn't real. 

Oh grow up.

Butters!

Yeah, we gotta remember to kick his ass tomorrow. 

Here, look for yourself.  He's based on the fable of a Dutch saint named Vunter Slash. 

Hey, check it out. She's totally staring you down.  She sure seems confident. You should probably go easy on her, dude. You don't wanna put her in the hospital or anything.

Yeah maybe we should think about this.

Yeah!

She hangs out behind the temp building during afternoon recess. She'll kiss any boy that pays her.

Mom?

That is true. Only a Paladin with a high constitution should watch the tape. Therefore, I think it is a job for you, Talangar the Black.

You guys, we got it!  We got it. Sally Darson is selling kisses for five dollars.

I've got three.

I've got better things to do.

Really? Cool.  It's funny, 'cause Tweek and Craig both went home about fifteen minutes ago.

No, no, just he is. 

Mr. Adler. Mr. Adler!

Yes, please, Eric. Why are you so cool?

Denver?

Wait, wait!

"My friend Bebe is really smart. She tells funny jokes and knows a lot about stuff. She's good at almost everything she tries. She's awesome. The end." 

Yeah. If we died right now, we'd have unclean souls and we'd burn in hell. 

Hey Token. Token, check out my girlfriend. 

Oh my God! What is he doing to my dog?

Um...

I heard the school nurse is hideously deformed.

It's all set. Once we have the device, it can be housed in here safely until we know what we're dealing with.

Why did we agree to that stupid app?!

I just can't believe how yummy these are.

Oh.

At least she didn't try to sit on him. 

Oh. Okay, hang on a second.  What troubles you?

From the nice guy at the county fair.

Faragon, asshole! 

Oh boy! Here we go!

Look, until we see this tape's power for ourselves, we cannot risk giving it to anybody.

What's goin' on? 

The mall isn't open yet. They're waiting for George R. R. Martin to come cut the ribbon.

That's the prettiest turkey I ever saw.

Butters!

Hey.

My paper is called, "Why Bebe is the coolest person, ever."

He's the most awesome kid in school!

There, you see? The girls have built some kind of stronghold to keep us out. 

We're busted. 

And your mom is okay with that?

I gotta- I gotta go. 

Wwooww.

Hababah...

Uh... Gi... ginger kids! AAAAAH! 

Hey, I'm not fat, you guys. I'm just kind of big-boned.

Like what?

They're gonna finally reveal who Phillip farted on to get out of jail.

Just find out who they're loyal to.

Oh Jesus, they're here! 

He's made up and people dress like him and pretend to be him to their kids.

You guys, check this out! 

Apparently, he stopped Microsoft from blockading the shipment of PS4s to the mall. Looks like he's all over the place winning the console wars for Sony.

What happens to the lion cubs?

We've got to get that picture to your mom so that she will come home and save us.

Yeah. Screw boobs! They're stupid!

No, I got it done. 

I totally can't see the fight, dude. I have detention after school.

...What if we don't want to be your friend?

Oh my God. Oh Christ no!

It's a miracle!

I bet I can spit the most on him. 

Whyyy? Whyyy?? 

Please, ya-you don't understand. The other kids are gonna make fun of me forever!

Well, there's really not that many of us. We figured we should let him join.

Oh, thanks, guys. 

Owww, you bit my arm! 

That's not what I said.

Hey, what's goin' on?  What's goin on? Hey.  Oh yeah, hey, whassup? What's goin' on? Nice.

There's a guy selling them downtown. But they're not made from recycled plastic.

Yeah. We need more of your mojo, Butters.

Tommy stuck his face in the belt sander 

Aaaah!

Who's the male lead?

This is Hawk Eyes. We've set up the net and we're standing by. 

I... nothing.

Right. 

It's okay, babe. Girls who don't have what you have are always going to put you down. 

We must have just missed him. He was playing at Cherry Creek mall and then Flat Irons mall. Now we don't know where to go because Slash is playing the Pavilion in Colorado Springs in the Gigadome in Moscow later this afternoon.

You guys, you guys.

...A whale. Talked to you.

Dow!

You guys, wait. 

Oh God, what have they done?!

Hey yeah, I know.  How about we ask those kids who play Star Trek?

Am I an Indian, or a pioneer?

Yeah.

Dad, is Slash real or make-believe?

Ow! Ahow-ow-ooooowww!

Put it, put it up on the, monitors! 

What do you guys want?

You're not supposed to be in the cafeteria.

I'm glad the food is good. Lorde sucks.

Yes. 

But we like being the Cows! 

I never realized ignoring him was an option.

Yeah, I know. 

Oh my God, where is my homework?! I am freaking out! 

Aaaaah, owieeee, owieeee. 

Very well. You shall be the Fellowship of The Lord of the Rings. Good luck. I have to go home now before I get in trouble.

Ah, my dog Rex follows me to football practice all the time.

Right. And you're a ginger. 

What's it look like?

Like that motorcycle kid in Bad News Bears.

Mrs. Garrison, one of your students is about to be attacked at the park by all the other students.

I haven't decided yet.

Yeah, me too. 

Well I guess we're never gonna know. There's no way to tell.

I don't know. 

Wow! I wanna sue somebody! 

Look at those ridiculous things!

Thank you. 

Yeah Eric, we're gonna stop ignoring you now. 

I can't even remember if we're supposed to hug the fullback or compliment him. I'm so confused.

What?

So? I have three copies. And the DVD with twelve hours of extra footage.

Kyle's dad got me 1.4 million, and he can do it for you, too. Just look at all these beautiful girls! 

Yeah!

And so that is the situation. The video may or may not have evil power. Kyle, would you bring it up here, please? 

Mom?

Yes. 

The police found hours and hours of murder porn on the Hagens' DVR. What more proof do we need?!

All that build-up for nothing.

Yeah, and it was called Man from Atlantis, and he had like, webbed fingers... 

We don't know. He's everywhere.

We're tryin' to get Bebe to run for class president.

Tonight we present the story of a courageous girl and her fight against depression

Oh.

Yes. Yes, please!

Not watch Terrance & Phillip ever? 

Hey, Kyle. Look man, it doesn't matter what people think, okay?  You know, Abraham Lincoln was pretty ugly too, but look what he accomplished.  Chin up, cowboy.  Hey, what's goin' on? 

Yeah. Those girls don't realize what good sledders Stan, Kyle, and Kenny are.

Yes they are!

I don't know, that looks pretty high up.

Huh?

I hope my dad doesn't sing.

Good luck, man. 

So then when she sticks her tongue out you just kind of lick it with your tongue.

Hey, here he comes!

Wow, hellafun. That's awesome.

You didn't hear?! Now that America knows Butters was actually a violent psychopath, they're saying you made a bullcrap bullying video!

I have... I have AIDS. 

If it's just looks then I think I'm safe.

Programs, get your programs here. Programs.

What are you doing, Butters?

There's no alternative. We have to return the tape before it causes more damage!

Butters, that's not cool, man.  He can't help how he looks. 

Kyle's not here. Cartman didn't invite him.

You mean they both have butts instead of heads?

I think you're a big fat piece of crap.

All right all right, I'll do it!

Wow. Tweek and Craig really hate each other, huh? This should be a good fight.

Aaaah!

Twitter says they're introducing a new Elmo doll this Christmas.

One of our parents.

What's she look like?

Yeah, go kick his ass.

...We've gotta get to that church before we die.

Hoh hoh hoh! 

Then, he's already dead.

Uh, my bitch is still the hottest, you guys.

What number am I on?

What do you guys want?

Oppression. Our play begins in a simpler time.  Alabama, in the late 1800s 

Hey! Hey, Stan! You're not gonna believe it! You've gotta come see!

Have any of you dumb girls seen Bebe anywhere?

Slash isn't real.

What do we do?

Oh, thank you! Thank you for coming back!  Thank you so much. Thank you.

Hey.

Yeah. Forget about the girls. What about if the CIA or, or the Russians know we have this? They'll come after us for sure.

That we can go back to being the South Park Cows! 

...Oh...

Awe, come on, lay off him guys.

Kyle, the person leaving.

Yeah yeah, come on! 

We're never gonna outdo them now! 

Please just hurry to the park! You have to stop them!

Right this way!  You can't eat in the cafeteria! 

Who's Scott Tenorman?

Ask if the Broncos are gonna win on Sunday.

No.

Mom?

I hate it here and I wanna go home!! 

Lying jerk! 

I guess they don't wanna fight.

That is an awesome answer!

All right, hurry! Get it up there! Let's see it!

What vice did you see on the videotape, Talangar? Is it the work of Sauron's magic? 

Dude.

Whales are mammals; they don't need water to breathe, dumb-ass.

Hey, he's here. 

But she's not gonna die, is she?

Brainnns. Ahh. 

It's weird how we never noticed before. 

No it's not! You made me run away to be a pirate and there's not even any treasure!

Me?  I'm the cutest? 

Which nobody can afford.

You said there was gonna be crystal clear lagoons and treasure and plunderrrr! 

Yeah, so do I.

Hey Token. You know, I never noticed before, but that girl Bebe is... kinda cool.

Nobody saw that coming.

Oh. 

I don't know. I got this emergency letter from Cartman that said to meet in his basement. 

And the commercial where the two kids have pot and the one kids shoots the other. Harmless?

Me too.

Hey Cartman. Heard you're transgender.

Nice.

Naw, you're not fat.

What? She die or something?

You know, the sequel to High School Musical 1 and 2.

What?

Yeah, and it's from Broadway.

I'm not fat.

Ye-you guys, we'd better go. Recess is almost over.

Yeah. They say it's gonna take three weeks to get it all down.

I'm just gonna stop playing.

Alright.

Whoa...

What? What are you gonna do to him?

Well, we might as well call up Lakewood and tell 'em we forfeit. 

This is so... embarrassing.

I'm not gonna touch it. You throw it away.

Are you guys dumb? We can't beat him, even with all of us. It's a waste of time.

YOU, SIR, MOCKED CARTMAN BEFORE, YET YOU TWO SIT HERE DEMANDING ANSWERS!  NOW DAMN YOU, LET HIM SPEAK!

Sure was better when our parents were buyin' us stuff.

Hey, did you guys see Eavesdropper? Pete Melman shit his pants! 

Sorry. If we let one ginger kid in here, then the others are gonna start coming.

The Sony people might not be our biggest problem.

And so, we must all recycle. Every day. Recycling is important, and it will save our planet, Earth. The End. 

Hard to port!

He won't make it.

Ha! We cannot trust something of that much power to a dwarf! Especially a kindergartner dwarf. 

Ow. 

Hey, what's goin' on?

Right here.

Sure. 

One of our parents!

I'm still not totally sure.

This whole thing is stupid! You don't pick people you wanna be with by making it into a game!

Yeah, just let me show her real quick how to put the thumb and-

Well we can't keep the whale out here anymore, people are gonna see it!

What if we don't know anybody who was in Vietnam?

Ah, excuse me? My daddy is a geologist and he says there actually isn't any concrete evidence of global warming.

You're gonna be fine.

How many people are on Shitter?

So I don't get to be on the team now?

Very well, I shall call the council together. Meet me in the Woods of Gathering behind Talangar the Black's house. And don't let my mom see you, 'cause I'll get in trouble.

Hoh!

Let me see.

What's Shitter?

Okay mom, just not in front of my friends okay?

One thing for sure, this tape cannot be trusted with anybody. This must be returned to the video store from whence it came.

How come you get to use it first?

Yeah, we just started dating seriously.  You wanna meet my new girlfriend, Tweek?

Naw, Rebecca's just a friend. I wanna be with you now. Sure, yeah, I'll buy you some shoes too.

You guys, maybe we should just... wait a few more minutes?

Yeah.  Here, it's like if you put your thumb on this side-

Why are they doing this?!

We're just having a hard time finding him.

Bitchin'. 

Hey, what's going on?

That's not very nice, Wendy.

Mexico has a space program?

Then fight us!

What's that?

Bebe! Where Bebe?! Bebe! Bebe! 

Uh, how long do you expect the fight to last?

It is too far and too dangerous to go alone. Take with you the wizard , the dwarf , the warrior , the cleric , and the Jew .

Make him stop!

But why me, doctor? Why me?! How did I get this?!

Yes you do. 

This is Somalia?

Let's never let boobs come between us again!

Hey, Timmy might need some help pulling his pants down.

So that's it?

Hooray for Eric!

Chase his tail? That must be so funny?

Me too.

Nobody wants to touch it.

Well, we can add music numbers, but how do we make the Helen Keller story more Thanksgivingy?
