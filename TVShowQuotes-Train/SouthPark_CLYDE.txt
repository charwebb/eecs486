How come you get to use it first?
I totally can't see the fight, dude. I have detention after school.
Hey, check it out. She's totally staring you down.  She sure seems confident. You should probably go easy on her, dude. You don't wanna put her in the hospital or anything.
Mrs. Garrison, one of your students is about to be attacked at the park by all the other students.
At least she didn't try to sit on him. 
Yes, please, Eric. Why are you so cool?
We must have just missed him. He was playing at Cherry Creek mall and then Flat Irons mall. Now we don't know where to go because Slash is playing the Pavilion in Colorado Springs in the Gigadome in Moscow later this afternoon.
And the commercial where the two kids have pot and the one kids shoots the other. Harmless?
Well, we can add music numbers, but how do we make the Helen Keller story more Thanksgivingy?
Tonight we present the story of a courageous girl and her fight against depression
I hate it here and I wanna go home!! 
What? What are you gonna do to him?
I never realized ignoring him was an option.
Oh my God, where is my homework?! I am freaking out! 
You guys, we got it!  We got it. Sally Darson is selling kisses for five dollars.
You mean they both have butts instead of heads?
Have any of you dumb girls seen Bebe anywhere?
You guys! You guuys! We've got some bad news. Slash isn't real. 
"My friend Bebe is really smart. She tells funny jokes and knows a lot about stuff. She's good at almost everything she tries. She's awesome. The end." 
Yeah. If we died right now, we'd have unclean souls and we'd burn in hell. 
Oppression. Our play begins in a simpler time.  Alabama, in the late 1800s 
Are you guys dumb? We can't beat him, even with all of us. It's a waste of time.
Very well. You shall be the Fellowship of The Lord of the Rings. Good luck. I have to go home now before I get in trouble.
My paper is called, "Why Bebe is the coolest person, ever."
Whales are mammals; they don't need water to breathe, dumb-ass.
Ye-you guys, we'd better go. Recess is almost over.
The mall isn't open yet. They're waiting for George R. R. Martin to come cut the ribbon.
Yeah. We need more of your mojo, Butters.
Please, ya-you don't understand. The other kids are gonna make fun of me forever!
Let's never let boobs come between us again!
Ask if the Broncos are gonna win on Sunday.
Something's wrong with Chef. He's saying some really weird stuff.
And so that is the situation. The video may or may not have evil power. Kyle, would you bring it up here, please? 
I don't know. I got this emergency letter from Cartman that said to meet in his basement. 
That is true. Only a Paladin with a high constitution should watch the tape. Therefore, I think it is a job for you, Talangar the Black.
You guys, maybe we should just... wait a few more minutes?
We're tryin' to get Bebe to run for class president.
She hangs out behind the temp building during afternoon recess. She'll kiss any boy that pays her.
What vice did you see on the videotape, Talangar? Is it the work of Sauron's magic? 
Butters, that's not cool, man.  He can't help how he looks. 
Chase his tail? That must be so funny?
I just can't believe how yummy these are.
Ah, excuse me? My daddy is a geologist and he says there actually isn't any concrete evidence of global warming.
There's no alternative. We have to return the tape before it causes more damage!
Hey, did you guys see Eavesdropper? Pete Melman shit his pants! 
That we can go back to being the South Park Cows! 
Yeah, and it was called Man from Atlantis, and he had like, webbed fingers... 
YOU, SIR, MOCKED CARTMAN BEFORE, YET YOU TWO SIT HERE DEMANDING ANSWERS!  NOW DAMN YOU, LET HIM SPEAK!
He's made up and people dress like him and pretend to be him to their kids.
Very well, I shall call the council together. Meet me in the Woods of Gathering behind Talangar the Black's house. And don't let my mom see you, 'cause I'll get in trouble.
Hey! Hey, Stan! You're not gonna believe it! You've gotta come see!
Right this way!  You can't eat in the cafeteria! 
Yeah.  Here, it's like if you put your thumb on this side-
Hey, what's goin' on?  What's goin on? Hey.  Oh yeah, hey, whassup? What's goin' on? Nice.
Well, there's really not that many of us. We figured we should let him join.
What if we don't know anybody who was in Vietnam?
The police found hours and hours of murder porn on the Hagens' DVR. What more proof do we need?!
Please just hurry to the park! You have to stop them!
I don't know, that looks pretty high up.
It's okay, babe. Girls who don't have what you have are always going to put you down. 
Like that motorcycle kid in Bad News Bears.
I think you're a big fat piece of crap.
Hey Token. You know, I never noticed before, but that girl Bebe is... kinda cool.
I wanna go again. I wanna go again!
Hey, Timmy might need some help pulling his pants down.
Ha! We cannot trust something of that much power to a dwarf! Especially a kindergartner dwarf. 
Here, look for yourself.  He's based on the fable of a Dutch saint named Vunter Slash. 
Hey yeah, I know.  How about we ask those kids who play Star Trek?
So then when she sticks her tongue out you just kind of lick it with your tongue.
Yeah, what's the big idea having your mom call all our moms last night?
Yeah! But I think it's broke down. The cars aren't moving.
Apparently, he stopped Microsoft from blockading the shipment of PS4s to the mall. Looks like he's all over the place winning the console wars for Sony.
This whole thing is stupid! You don't pick people you wanna be with by making it into a game!
There, you see? The girls have built some kind of stronghold to keep us out. 
...What if we don't want to be your friend?
But we have a big deal with EA Sports that depends on it.
No it's not! You made me run away to be a pirate and there's not even any treasure!
This is Hawk Eyes. We've set up the net and we're standing by. 
Put it, put it up on the, monitors! 
For the last time, I'm not fat, so stop calling me fat, God-damnit! 
Why did we agree to that stupid app?!
Yeah. Forget about the girls. What about if the CIA or, or the Russians know we have this? They'll come after us for sure.
It is too far and too dangerous to go alone. Take with you the wizard , the dwarf , the warrior , the cleric , and the Jew .
So I don't get to be on the team now?
I think...  I think he wants to have sex with me.
I don't know, it's just a cool costume.
It's all set. Once we have the device, it can be housed in here safely until we know what we're dealing with.
One thing for sure, this tape cannot be trusted with anybody. This must be returned to the video store from whence it came.
But why me, doctor? Why me?! How did I get this?!
Naw, Rebecca's just a friend. I wanna be with you now. Sure, yeah, I'll buy you some shoes too.
Yeah. They say it's gonna take three weeks to get it all down.
Wow. Tweek and Craig really hate each other, huh? This should be a good fight.
Oh. Okay, hang on a second.  What troubles you?
Kyle's dad got me 1.4 million, and he can do it for you, too. Just look at all these beautiful girls! 
Sure was better when our parents were buyin' us stuff.
Really? Cool.  It's funny, 'cause Tweek and Craig both went home about fifteen minutes ago.
And so, we must all recycle. Every day. Recycling is important, and it will save our planet, Earth. The End. 
Twitter says they're introducing a new Elmo doll this Christmas.
...We've gotta get to that church before we die.
We're just having a hard time finding him.
I bet I can spit the most on him. 
I heard the school nurse is hideously deformed.
Well we can't keep the whale out here anymore, people are gonna see it!
Yeah Eric, we're gonna stop ignoring you now. 
We've got to get that picture to your mom so that she will come home and save us.
Uh, my bitch is still the hottest, you guys.
Tommy stuck his face in the belt sander 
Oh, thank you! Thank you for coming back!  Thank you so much. Thank you.
Sorry. If we let one ginger kid in here, then the others are gonna start coming.
So? I have three copies. And the DVD with twelve hours of extra footage.
Hey, Kyle. Look man, it doesn't matter what people think, okay?  You know, Abraham Lincoln was pretty ugly too, but look what he accomplished.  Chin up, cowboy.  Hey, what's goin' on? 
Yeah, we gotta remember to kick his ass tomorrow. 
There's a guy selling them downtown. But they're not made from recycled plastic.
If it's just looks then I think I'm safe.
Yeah, just let me show her real quick how to put the thumb and-
I can't even remember if we're supposed to hug the fullback or compliment him. I'm so confused.
Look, until we see this tape's power for ourselves, we cannot risk giving it to anybody.
Yeah. Those girls don't realize what good sledders Stan, Kyle, and Kenny are.
Well, we might as well call up Lakewood and tell 'em we forfeit. 
Well I guess we're never gonna know. There's no way to tell.
The Sony people might not be our biggest problem.
All right, hurry! Get it up there! Let's see it!
They're gonna finally reveal who Phillip farted on to get out of jail.
Oh my God! What is he doing to my dog?
Hey, I'm not fat, you guys. I'm just kind of big-boned.
