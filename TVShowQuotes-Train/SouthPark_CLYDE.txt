And so that is the situation. The video may or may not have evil power. Kyle, would you bring it up here, please? 
Here, look for yourself.  He's based on the fable of a Dutch saint named Vunter Slash. 
From the nice guy at the county fair.
You guys, we got it!  We got it. Sally Darson is selling kisses for five dollars.
Ask if the Broncos are gonna win on Sunday.
You said there was gonna be crystal clear lagoons and treasure and plunderrrr! 
He's made up and people dress like him and pretend to be him to their kids.
Yeah! But I think it's broke down. The cars aren't moving.
You guys! You guuys! We've got some bad news. Slash isn't real. 
You know, the sequel to High School Musical 1 and 2.
Hey Token. You know, I never noticed before, but that girl Bebe is... kinda cool.
At least she didn't try to sit on him. 
I heard the school nurse is hideously deformed.
We've got to get that picture to your mom so that she will come home and save us.
You wanna know who I hate?! I hate that kid Butters! He's a dork!
I don't know, that looks pretty high up.
Yes, please, Eric. Why are you so cool?
Okay mom, just not in front of my friends okay?
Kyle's dad got me 1.4 million, and he can do it for you, too. Just look at all these beautiful girls! 
Yeah, we gotta remember to kick his ass tomorrow. 
Well I guess we're never gonna know. There's no way to tell.
...What if we don't want to be your friend?
I don't know, it's just a cool costume.
We're just having a hard time finding him.
The Sony people might not be our biggest problem.
I wanna go again. I wanna go again!
So then when she sticks her tongue out you just kind of lick it with your tongue.
Yeah. If we died right now, we'd have unclean souls and we'd burn in hell. 
You're not supposed to be in the cafeteria.
There's no alternative. We have to return the tape before it causes more damage!
Something's wrong with Chef. He's saying some really weird stuff.
Sorry. If we let one ginger kid in here, then the others are gonna start coming.
Put it, put it up on the, monitors! 
That we can go back to being the South Park Cows! 
Ha! We cannot trust something of that much power to a dwarf! Especially a kindergartner dwarf. 
There's a guy selling them downtown. But they're not made from recycled plastic.
Yeah. We need more of your mojo, Butters.
Tonight we present the story of a courageous girl and her fight against depression
Hey, I'm not fat, you guys. I'm just kind of big-boned.
I bet I can spit the most on him. 
So? I have three copies. And the DVD with twelve hours of extra footage.
Look, could you guys just not say anything about this in school, please?
Wow. Tweek and Craig really hate each other, huh? This should be a good fight.
What? What are you gonna do to him?
Yeah. Forget about the girls. What about if the CIA or, or the Russians know we have this? They'll come after us for sure.
What if we don't know anybody who was in Vietnam?
Well, we might as well call up Lakewood and tell 'em we forfeit. 
Yeah. They say it's gonna take three weeks to get it all down.
Well we can't keep the whale out here anymore, people are gonna see it!
Hey, what's goin' on?  What's goin on? Hey.  Oh yeah, hey, whassup? What's goin' on? Nice.
Ye-you guys, we'd better go. Recess is almost over.
Yeah. Those girls don't realize what good sledders Stan, Kyle, and Kenny are.
Very well. You shall be the Fellowship of The Lord of the Rings. Good luck. I have to go home now before I get in trouble.
That is true. Only a Paladin with a high constitution should watch the tape. Therefore, I think it is a job for you, Talangar the Black.
No it's not! You made me run away to be a pirate and there's not even any treasure!
Really? Cool.  It's funny, 'cause Tweek and Craig both went home about fifteen minutes ago.
Butters, that's not cool, man.  He can't help how he looks. 
But we have a big deal with EA Sports that depends on it.
She hangs out behind the temp building during afternoon recess. She'll kiss any boy that pays her.
Yeah Eric, we're gonna stop ignoring you now. 
Hey, Timmy might need some help pulling his pants down.
Right this way!  You can't eat in the cafeteria! 
It's all set. Once we have the device, it can be housed in here safely until we know what we're dealing with.
Hey, did you guys see Eavesdropper? Pete Melman shit his pants! 
I think you're a big fat piece of crap.
Uh, how long do you expect the fight to last?
There, you see? The girls have built some kind of stronghold to keep us out. 
Naw, Rebecca's just a friend. I wanna be with you now. Sure, yeah, I'll buy you some shoes too.
Please, ya-you don't understand. The other kids are gonna make fun of me forever!
Sure was better when our parents were buyin' us stuff.
Ah, my dog Rex follows me to football practice all the time.
It is too far and too dangerous to go alone. Take with you the wizard , the dwarf , the warrior , the cleric , and the Jew .
Look, until we see this tape's power for ourselves, we cannot risk giving it to anybody.
Have any of you dumb girls seen Bebe anywhere?
Twitter says they're introducing a new Elmo doll this Christmas.
Apparently, he stopped Microsoft from blockading the shipment of PS4s to the mall. Looks like he's all over the place winning the console wars for Sony.
Why did we agree to that stupid app?!
You didn't hear?! Now that America knows Butters was actually a violent psychopath, they're saying you made a bullcrap bullying video!
Oppression. Our play begins in a simpler time.  Alabama, in the late 1800s 
This is Hawk Eyes. We've set up the net and we're standing by. 
Well, we can add music numbers, but how do we make the Helen Keller story more Thanksgivingy?
Hey! Hey, Stan! You're not gonna believe it! You've gotta come see!
The mall isn't open yet. They're waiting for George R. R. Martin to come cut the ribbon.
Yeah.  Here, it's like if you put your thumb on this side-
I think...  I think he wants to have sex with me.
Well, there's really not that many of us. We figured we should let him join.
What vice did you see on the videotape, Talangar? Is it the work of Sauron's magic? 
Yeah, just let me show her real quick how to put the thumb and-
Uh, my bitch is still the hottest, you guys.
I can't even remember if we're supposed to hug the fullback or compliment him. I'm so confused.
And so, we must all recycle. Every day. Recycling is important, and it will save our planet, Earth. The End. 
You mean they both have butts instead of heads?
I totally can't see the fight, dude. I have detention after school.
You guys, maybe we should just... wait a few more minutes?
Tommy stuck his face in the belt sander 
Let's never let boobs come between us again!
Hey, check it out. She's totally staring you down.  She sure seems confident. You should probably go easy on her, dude. You don't wanna put her in the hospital or anything.
Mrs. Garrison, one of your students is about to be attacked at the park by all the other students.
We must have just missed him. He was playing at Cherry Creek mall and then Flat Irons mall. Now we don't know where to go because Slash is playing the Pavilion in Colorado Springs in the Gigadome in Moscow later this afternoon.
Yeah, and it was called Man from Atlantis, and he had like, webbed fingers... 
YOU, SIR, MOCKED CARTMAN BEFORE, YET YOU TWO SIT HERE DEMANDING ANSWERS!  NOW DAMN YOU, LET HIM SPEAK!
My paper is called, "Why Bebe is the coolest person, ever."
One thing for sure, this tape cannot be trusted with anybody. This must be returned to the video store from whence it came.
Are you guys dumb? We can't beat him, even with all of us. It's a waste of time.
Chase his tail? That must be so funny?
But why me, doctor? Why me?! How did I get this?!
I'm not gonna touch it. You throw it away.
All right, hurry! Get it up there! Let's see it!
...We've gotta get to that church before we die.
Oh, thank you! Thank you for coming back!  Thank you so much. Thank you.
For the last time, I'm not fat, so stop calling me fat, God-damnit! 
I hate it here and I wanna go home!! 
Very well, I shall call the council together. Meet me in the Woods of Gathering behind Talangar the Black's house. And don't let my mom see you, 'cause I'll get in trouble.
Yeah, what's the big idea having your mom call all our moms last night?
They're gonna finally reveal who Phillip farted on to get out of jail.
I'm glad the food is good. Lorde sucks.
And the commercial where the two kids have pot and the one kids shoots the other. Harmless?
So I don't get to be on the team now?
It's okay, babe. Girls who don't have what you have are always going to put you down. 
Please just hurry to the park! You have to stop them!
I never realized ignoring him was an option.
Hey, Kyle. Look man, it doesn't matter what people think, okay?  You know, Abraham Lincoln was pretty ugly too, but look what he accomplished.  Chin up, cowboy.  Hey, what's goin' on? 
Yeah, we just started dating seriously.  You wanna meet my new girlfriend, Tweek?
The police found hours and hours of murder porn on the Hagens' DVR. What more proof do we need?!
I just can't believe how yummy these are.
