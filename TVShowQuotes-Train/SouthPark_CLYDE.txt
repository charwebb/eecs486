Yeah.  Here, it's like if you put your thumb on this side-
One thing for sure, this tape cannot be trusted with anybody. This must be returned to the video store from whence it came.
Apparently, he stopped Microsoft from blockading the shipment of PS4s to the mall. Looks like he's all over the place winning the console wars for Sony.
Oh my God! What is he doing to my dog?
You didn't hear?! Now that America knows Butters was actually a violent psychopath, they're saying you made a bullcrap bullying video!
YOU, SIR, MOCKED CARTMAN BEFORE, YET YOU TWO SIT HERE DEMANDING ANSWERS!  NOW DAMN YOU, LET HIM SPEAK!
They're gonna finally reveal who Phillip farted on to get out of jail.
Yeah Eric, we're gonna stop ignoring you now. 
Like that motorcycle kid in Bad News Bears.
Tonight we present the story of a courageous girl and her fight against depression
He's made up and people dress like him and pretend to be him to their kids.
Ha! We cannot trust something of that much power to a dwarf! Especially a kindergartner dwarf. 
Look, could you guys just not say anything about this in school, please?
There's a guy selling them downtown. But they're not made from recycled plastic.
We must have just missed him. He was playing at Cherry Creek mall and then Flat Irons mall. Now we don't know where to go because Slash is playing the Pavilion in Colorado Springs in the Gigadome in Moscow later this afternoon.
Yeah. Those girls don't realize what good sledders Stan, Kyle, and Kenny are.
Sorry. If we let one ginger kid in here, then the others are gonna start coming.
Tommy stuck his face in the belt sander 
...What if we don't want to be your friend?
There, you see? The girls have built some kind of stronghold to keep us out. 
Hey, Kyle. Look man, it doesn't matter what people think, okay?  You know, Abraham Lincoln was pretty ugly too, but look what he accomplished.  Chin up, cowboy.  Hey, what's goin' on? 
And the commercial where the two kids have pot and the one kids shoots the other. Harmless?
The Sony people might not be our biggest problem.
This is Hawk Eyes. We've set up the net and we're standing by. 
I wanna go again. I wanna go again!
I think you're a big fat piece of crap.
You know, the sequel to High School Musical 1 and 2.
Yeah, and it was called Man from Atlantis, and he had like, webbed fingers... 
I totally can't see the fight, dude. I have detention after school.
I don't know, that looks pretty high up.
Chase his tail? That must be so funny?
Yeah. We need more of your mojo, Butters.
Very well, I shall call the council together. Meet me in the Woods of Gathering behind Talangar the Black's house. And don't let my mom see you, 'cause I'll get in trouble.
From the nice guy at the county fair.
That is true. Only a Paladin with a high constitution should watch the tape. Therefore, I think it is a job for you, Talangar the Black.
Kyle's dad got me 1.4 million, and he can do it for you, too. Just look at all these beautiful girls! 
Hey, did you guys see Eavesdropper? Pete Melman shit his pants! 
This whole thing is stupid! You don't pick people you wanna be with by making it into a game!
Butters, that's not cool, man.  He can't help how he looks. 
You said there was gonna be crystal clear lagoons and treasure and plunderrrr! 
I don't know. I got this emergency letter from Cartman that said to meet in his basement. 
The mall isn't open yet. They're waiting for George R. R. Martin to come cut the ribbon.
Yeah! But I think it's broke down. The cars aren't moving.
Okay mom, just not in front of my friends okay?
I think...  I think he wants to have sex with me.
Oppression. Our play begins in a simpler time.  Alabama, in the late 1800s 
You're not supposed to be in the cafeteria.
How come you get to use it first?
Whales are mammals; they don't need water to breathe, dumb-ass.
I just can't believe how yummy these are.
Look, until we see this tape's power for ourselves, we cannot risk giving it to anybody.
Something's wrong with Chef. He's saying some really weird stuff.
Hey, check it out. She's totally staring you down.  She sure seems confident. You should probably go easy on her, dude. You don't wanna put her in the hospital or anything.
All right, hurry! Get it up there! Let's see it!
Why did we agree to that stupid app?!
My paper is called, "Why Bebe is the coolest person, ever."
You guys, maybe we should just... wait a few more minutes?
I heard the school nurse is hideously deformed.
The police found hours and hours of murder porn on the Hagens' DVR. What more proof do we need?!
Mrs. Garrison, one of your students is about to be attacked at the park by all the other students.
Please just hurry to the park! You have to stop them!
Hey, Timmy might need some help pulling his pants down.
I hate it here and I wanna go home!! 
Well, we can add music numbers, but how do we make the Helen Keller story more Thanksgivingy?
It is too far and too dangerous to go alone. Take with you the wizard , the dwarf , the warrior , the cleric , and the Jew .
It's okay, babe. Girls who don't have what you have are always going to put you down. 
What? What are you gonna do to him?
Well I guess we're never gonna know. There's no way to tell.
Ask if the Broncos are gonna win on Sunday.
Yeah. Forget about the girls. What about if the CIA or, or the Russians know we have this? They'll come after us for sure.
Uh, my bitch is still the hottest, you guys.
But we have a big deal with EA Sports that depends on it.
So I don't get to be on the team now?
Naw, Rebecca's just a friend. I wanna be with you now. Sure, yeah, I'll buy you some shoes too.
No it's not! You made me run away to be a pirate and there's not even any treasure!
Yeah, just let me show her real quick how to put the thumb and-
I bet I can spit the most on him. 
There's no alternative. We have to return the tape before it causes more damage!
You wanna know who I hate?! I hate that kid Butters! He's a dork!
You guys, we got it!  We got it. Sally Darson is selling kisses for five dollars.
Oh. Okay, hang on a second.  What troubles you?
Let's never let boobs come between us again!
Yeah. They say it's gonna take three weeks to get it all down.
Yeah, what's the big idea having your mom call all our moms last night?
Twitter says they're introducing a new Elmo doll this Christmas.
It's all set. Once we have the device, it can be housed in here safely until we know what we're dealing with.
Here, look for yourself.  He's based on the fable of a Dutch saint named Vunter Slash. 
Ah, excuse me? My daddy is a geologist and he says there actually isn't any concrete evidence of global warming.
Hey, what's goin' on?  What's goin on? Hey.  Oh yeah, hey, whassup? What's goin' on? Nice.
Really? Cool.  It's funny, 'cause Tweek and Craig both went home about fifteen minutes ago.
That we can go back to being the South Park Cows! 
Well, there's really not that many of us. We figured we should let him join.
You guys! You guuys! We've got some bad news. Slash isn't real. 
Ye-you guys, we'd better go. Recess is almost over.
Sure was better when our parents were buyin' us stuff.
And so that is the situation. The video may or may not have evil power. Kyle, would you bring it up here, please? 
So? I have three copies. And the DVD with twelve hours of extra footage.
We've got to get that picture to your mom so that she will come home and save us.
Hey, I'm not fat, you guys. I'm just kind of big-boned.
Yes, please, Eric. Why are you so cool?
"My friend Bebe is really smart. She tells funny jokes and knows a lot about stuff. She's good at almost everything she tries. She's awesome. The end." 
What if we don't know anybody who was in Vietnam?
But why me, doctor? Why me?! How did I get this?!
So then when she sticks her tongue out you just kind of lick it with your tongue.
I never realized ignoring him was an option.
Very well. You shall be the Fellowship of The Lord of the Rings. Good luck. I have to go home now before I get in trouble.
For the last time, I'm not fat, so stop calling me fat, God-damnit! 
Wow. Tweek and Craig really hate each other, huh? This should be a good fight.
Hey yeah, I know.  How about we ask those kids who play Star Trek?
Put it, put it up on the, monitors! 
I'm glad the food is good. Lorde sucks.
At least she didn't try to sit on him. 
Oh, thank you! Thank you for coming back!  Thank you so much. Thank you.
Well, we might as well call up Lakewood and tell 'em we forfeit. 
...We've gotta get to that church before we die.
I can't even remember if we're supposed to hug the fullback or compliment him. I'm so confused.
Are you guys dumb? We can't beat him, even with all of us. It's a waste of time.
I'm not gonna touch it. You throw it away.
Ah, my dog Rex follows me to football practice all the time.
Well we can't keep the whale out here anymore, people are gonna see it!
If it's just looks then I think I'm safe.
Yeah, we gotta remember to kick his ass tomorrow. 
Hey Token. You know, I never noticed before, but that girl Bebe is... kinda cool.
Hey! Hey, Stan! You're not gonna believe it! You've gotta come see!
Oh my God, where is my homework?! I am freaking out!
