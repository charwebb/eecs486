Okay mom, just not in front of my friends okay?

Programs, get your programs here. Programs.

Very well, I shall call the council together. Meet me in the Woods of Gathering behind Talangar the Black's house. And don't let my mom see you, 'cause I'll get in trouble.

The police found hours and hours of murder porn on the Hagens' DVR. What more proof do we need?!

Very well. You shall be the Fellowship of The Lord of the Rings. Good luck. I have to go home now before I get in trouble.

And so, we must all recycle. Every day. Recycling is important, and it will save our planet, Earth. The End. 

You try it, Bebe.

Oh, now what?

YOU, SIR, MOCKED CARTMAN BEFORE, YET YOU TWO SIT HERE DEMANDING ANSWERS!  NOW DAMN YOU, LET HIM SPEAK!

Oh my God, where is my homework?! I am freaking out! 

Here, look for yourself.  He's based on the fable of a Dutch saint named Vunter Slash. 

So then when she sticks her tongue out you just kind of lick it with your tongue.

Lying jerk! 

What?

Which nobody can afford.

Aaaaah, owieeee, owieeee. 

"My friend Bebe is really smart. She tells funny jokes and knows a lot about stuff. She's good at almost everything she tries. She's awesome. The end." 

Tonight we present the story of a courageous girl and her fight against depression

Yeah. If we died right now, we'd have unclean souls and we'd burn in hell. 

But we have a big deal with EA Sports that depends on it.

I just can't believe how yummy these are.

Hey, I'm not fat, you guys. I'm just kind of big-boned.

Right this way!  You can't eat in the cafeteria! 

From the nice guy at the county fair.

Uh... Gi... ginger kids! AAAAAH! 

That's not what I said.

Nobody wants to touch it.

Ah, my dog Rex follows me to football practice all the time.

I think you're a big fat piece of crap.

What do you guys want?

Yeah, we just started dating seriously.  You wanna meet my new girlfriend, Tweek?

Sure. 

Well I guess we're never gonna know. There's no way to tell.

Make him stop!

Oh, thank you! Thank you for coming back!  Thank you so much. Thank you.

Mom, I'm in class.

Well, we might as well call up Lakewood and tell 'em we forfeit. 

Brainnns. Ahh. 

Ask if the Broncos are gonna win on Sunday.

Yeah. We need more of your mojo, Butters.

Yeah. They say it's gonna take three weeks to get it all down.

...What if we don't want to be your friend?

Faragon, asshole! 

Yeah. Those girls don't realize what good sledders Stan, Kyle, and Kenny are.

Owww, you bit my arm! 

Wow! I wanna sue somebody! 

Mrs. Garrison, one of your students is about to be attacked at the park by all the other students.

Hey! Hey, Stan! You're not gonna believe it! You've gotta come see!

Hey, did you guys see Eavesdropper? Pete Melman shit his pants! 

Ha! We cannot trust something of that much power to a dwarf! Especially a kindergartner dwarf. 

You guys, you guys.

What do you guys want?

Mom?

You know, the sequel to High School Musical 1 and 2.

Hey.

All right, hurry! Get it up there! Let's see it!

Ye-you guys, we'd better go. Recess is almost over.

The Sony people might not be our biggest problem.

Like that motorcycle kid in Bad News Bears.

Right. 

We've got to get that picture to your mom so that she will come home and save us.

You didn't hear?! Now that America knows Butters was actually a violent psychopath, they're saying you made a bullcrap bullying video!

So I don't get to be on the team now?

Not watch Terrance & Phillip ever? 

Wow wee. 

Hoh hoh hoh! 

I don't know. 

I hate it here and I wanna go home!! 

That's the prettiest turkey I ever saw.

For the last time, I'm not fat, so stop calling me fat, God-damnit! 

Yes, please, Eric. Why are you so cool?

What? She die or something?

It's okay, babe. Girls who don't have what you have are always going to put you down. 

Yeah, and it's from Broadway.

Alright.

They're gonna finally reveal who Phillip farted on to get out of jail.

Kyle, the person leaving.

The mall isn't open yet. They're waiting for George R. R. Martin to come cut the ribbon.

Why did we agree to that stupid app?!

Hey, check it out. She's totally staring you down.  She sure seems confident. You should probably go easy on her, dude. You don't wanna put her in the hospital or anything.

He's made up and people dress like him and pretend to be him to their kids.

You guys, we got it!  We got it. Sally Darson is selling kisses for five dollars.

Bebe! Where Bebe?! Bebe! Bebe! 

Yeah, go kick his ass.

You wanna know who I hate?! I hate that kid Butters! He's a dork!

...We've gotta get to that church before we die.

Oh, thanks, guys. 

Bitchin'. 

And the commercial where the two kids have pot and the one kids shoots the other. Harmless?

Dude.

Hey Token. You know, I never noticed before, but that girl Bebe is... kinda cool.

You guys, wait. 

There, you see? The girls have built some kind of stronghold to keep us out. 

Hard to port!

You guys, check this out! 

That is an awesome answer!

Hooray for Eric!

...Oh...

One thing for sure, this tape cannot be trusted with anybody. This must be returned to the video store from whence it came.

Yes. 

He won't make it.

All right all right, I'll do it!

How come you get to use it first?

Mom, I'm sorry.

What?

No.

Yeah maybe we should think about this.

I don't know, that looks pretty high up.

Let's never let boobs come between us again!

Dow!

Me too.

Oh.

Tommy stuck his face in the belt sander 

No, no, just he is. 

Mom?

It's all set. Once we have the device, it can be housed in here safely until we know what we're dealing with.

At least she didn't try to sit on him. 

I wanna go again. I wanna go again!

This is Hawk Eyes. We've set up the net and we're standing by. 

But why me, doctor? Why me?! How did I get this?!

Oh God, what have they done?!

Oh my God. Oh Christ no!

I don't know. I got this emergency letter from Cartman that said to meet in his basement. 

Naw, you're not fat.

I never realized ignoring him was an option.

Yeah yeah, come on! 

This is so... embarrassing.

What are you doing, Butters?

Yeah! But I think it's broke down. The cars aren't moving.

You mean they both have butts instead of heads?

Yeah, just let me show her real quick how to put the thumb and-

Naw, Rebecca's just a friend. I wanna be with you now. Sure, yeah, I'll buy you some shoes too.

Hey, Timmy might need some help pulling his pants down.

All that build-up for nothing.

Please just hurry to the park! You have to stop them!

Are you guys dumb? We can't beat him, even with all of us. It's a waste of time.

Please, ya-you don't understand. The other kids are gonna make fun of me forever!

Where did they get that thing? 

One of our parents.

I was enthralled with the dialog exchange.

We're never gonna outdo them now! 

Ah, excuse me? My daddy is a geologist and he says there actually isn't any concrete evidence of global warming.

But she's not gonna die, is she?

We're busted. 

Kyle's dad got me 1.4 million, and he can do it for you, too. Just look at all these beautiful girls! 

Aaaah!

Yeah Eric, we're gonna stop ignoring you now. 

Hey, what's going on?

Have any of you dumb girls seen Bebe anywhere?

Uh, my bitch is still the hottest, you guys.

Whales are mammals; they don't need water to breathe, dumb-ass.

Slash isn't real.

Like what?

Who's the male lead?

Apparently, he stopped Microsoft from blockading the shipment of PS4s to the mall. Looks like he's all over the place winning the console wars for Sony.

Well, there's really not that many of us. We figured we should let him join.

Yeah, and it was called Man from Atlantis, and he had like, webbed fingers... 

Ow. 

Who's Scott Tenorman?

There's no alternative. We have to return the tape before it causes more damage!

There's a guy selling them downtown. But they're not made from recycled plastic.

It's a miracle!

I can't even remember if we're supposed to hug the fullback or compliment him. I'm so confused.

Hey, Kyle. Look man, it doesn't matter what people think, okay?  You know, Abraham Lincoln was pretty ugly too, but look what he accomplished.  Chin up, cowboy.  Hey, what's goin' on? 

That's not very nice, Wendy.

What? What are you gonna do to him?

He's the most awesome kid in school!

Well, we can add music numbers, but how do we make the Helen Keller story more Thanksgivingy?

I guess they don't wanna fight.

That we can go back to being the South Park Cows! 

What vice did you see on the videotape, Talangar? Is it the work of Sauron's magic? 

What's it look like?

You're gonna be fine.

Oh.

We don't know. He's everywhere.

Look, could you guys just not say anything about this in school, please?

Look, until we see this tape's power for ourselves, we cannot risk giving it to anybody.

Good luck, man. 

Whoa.  Is that Wendy Testaburger? 

Yeah!

You said there was gonna be crystal clear lagoons and treasure and plunderrrr! 

You guys! You guuys! We've got some bad news. Slash isn't real. 

Yeah, so do I.

Yeah.

This is Somalia?

Dad, is Slash real or make-believe?

Let me see.

Butters!

Hey, what's goin' on?

I don't know, it's just a cool costume.

Yeah. Forget about the girls. What about if the CIA or, or the Russians know we have this? They'll come after us for sure.

Oh. Okay, hang on a second.  What troubles you?

Oh boy here we go!

I've got three.

...Sick!

Oh Jesus, they're here! 

Something's wrong with Chef. He's saying some really weird stuff.

I've got better things to do.

So? I have three copies. And the DVD with twelve hours of extra footage.

Yes. Yes, please!

Me?  I'm the cutest? 

Nice.

I totally can't see the fight, dude. I have detention after school.

Yeah, I know. 

Huh?

So that's it?

Oh my God! What is he doing to my dog?

She hangs out behind the temp building during afternoon recess. She'll kiss any boy that pays her.

My paper is called, "Why Bebe is the coolest person, ever."

It's weird how we never noticed before. 

Sure was better when our parents were buyin' us stuff.

Well we can't keep the whale out here anymore, people are gonna see it!

Oh boy! Here we go!

We must have just missed him. He was playing at Cherry Creek mall and then Flat Irons mall. Now we don't know where to go because Slash is playing the Pavilion in Colorado Springs in the Gigadome in Moscow later this afternoon.

No it's not! You made me run away to be a pirate and there's not even any treasure!

What happens to the lion cubs?

Oh. 

I'm still not totally sure.

Why?

Hababah...

Wow, hellafun. That's awesome.

Nobody saw that coming.

I think...  I think he wants to have sex with me.

Yeah, me too. 

Twitter says they're introducing a new Elmo doll this Christmas.

Then, he's already dead.

Mom?

No, I got it done. 

I bet I can spit the most on him. 

One of our parents!

Am I an Indian, or a pioneer?

What's she look like?

Wwooww.

Mexico has a space program?

Yeah, we gotta remember to kick his ass tomorrow. 

Hey, what's goin' on?  What's goin on? Hey.  Oh yeah, hey, whassup? What's goin' on? Nice.

Sorry. If we let one ginger kid in here, then the others are gonna start coming.

I heard the school nurse is hideously deformed.

Why are they doing this?!

Hoh!

What if we don't know anybody who was in Vietnam?

Wait, wait!

Hey yeah, I know.  How about we ask those kids who play Star Trek?

I am.

Oh grow up.

You're not supposed to be in the cafeteria.

...A whale. Talked to you.

I'm glad the food is good. Lorde sucks.

Look at those ridiculous things!

Hey.

Somalia? Where's that?

I'm just gonna stop playing.

Yes. 

Yeah. Screw boobs! They're stupid!

Right. And you're a ginger. 

If it's just looks then I think I'm safe.

Butters, that's not cool, man.  He can't help how he looks. 

Wait a-wait a minute, what?

What's that?

Mr. Adler. Mr. Adler!

Oppression. Our play begins in a simpler time.  Alabama, in the late 1800s 

Denver?

I haven't decided yet.

Really? Cool.  It's funny, 'cause Tweek and Craig both went home about fifteen minutes ago.

But we like being the Cows! 

I threw up on my way home.

And your mom is okay with that?

How many people are on Shitter?

Butters!

Wow. Tweek and Craig really hate each other, huh? This should be a good fight.

Right here.

Me too.

Yeah.  Here, it's like if you put your thumb on this side-

Yeah, what's the big idea having your mom call all our moms last night?

Ow! Ahow-ow-ooooowww!

Yes you do. 

Did it hurt?

Oh.  Cool! He's here! 

Just find out who they're loyal to.

It is too far and too dangerous to go alone. Take with you the wizard , the dwarf , the warrior , the cleric , and the Jew .

I gotta- I gotta go. 

A toilet?

Kyle's not here. Cartman didn't invite him.

We don't have a coach, Kyle.

I'm not gonna touch it. You throw it away.

You guys, maybe we should just... wait a few more minutes?
