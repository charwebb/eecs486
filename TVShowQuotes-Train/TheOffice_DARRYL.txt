Yes! [to video screen]  Right here. You are a naughty girl!
There's information here? Yeah, you're right, I don't need this.
One more, yeah. [Again motions to go even higher]
I was talking like this. [mouths words while pointing to his ear] I don't feel good about it, but he just kept calling himself a gunshot victim and it got to me.
Yeah sorry, I'm just looking for a pen.
Hey, Devil's Den is that way, we should check it out. That's where the snipers hid.
Tracee Ellis Ross. Daughter of the First Lady of Motown, Diana Ross.
Uh oh, look at this. Red plastic cup, red plastic cup. How about that?
I'll never be sorry, not for a moment of it.
If we were living in Sweden, I wouldn't have to worry about this 'cause we'd have universal healthcare.
I was there. That dude is not engaged. I'm not a big believer in therapy, but I'll go into my own pocket to cover his co-pay.
[interrupting] Stop talking 'bout it. I said I'm fine with it.
You're gonna be missing out on some good ideas.
Let me put my shoes on. [hangs up phone, dial tone]
I hope so. Think about this carefully. There's better lives than this one.
I was in The Whiz in high school.
What'd I tell you about building forts in my warehouse?
Yes sir.  Remember that.  I'll be right outside if you need me
Yeah, I taught Mike some new phrases.  I want him to get the raise, I... just can't help myself.
Hey, hey, hey. I���ll do one thing with y���all.
Since Andy promoted me to assistant regional manager, I've been trying to step my game up, you know, be more productive. In fact, you know what? Let���s knock out a few more of these sound bites while we're here. [pauses] Whoa! That person has really gotten him or herself into quite a predicament.
[as Cookie Monster] Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum.
[scores] Here we go. Here we go. Here we go.
Nope. I'm good. I'm here. Let's find some warehouse workers.
Oh yeah, and um there's a Christmas party upstairs tonight, wanted to tell you about.
Hold up, I'm looking at my spit with a microscope.
Here is an old man and a goth dude... and then the old crone from Drag Me to Hell.
Nobody told me what people were, alright? So...  label yourselves or take what you get.
[clapping] You got this, Roy. [Roy begins playing and singing She's Got a Way by Billy Joel, Pam and Jim looked shocked, Phyllis and Bob begin making out]
You know what? It's your first time, let's split the office. You can have sales, the annex, Creed, and I don't know I'll just take, uh, accounting.
Just a hunch. Your gift is on the way.
Oh, no. I mean, I want to, I just...I don't want to force you into something you don't want to do.
Come on, now, Justine, look... Listen, look, I've been planning this, okay? You cannot do this, Justine.
I know Citizen Kane. Rosebud didn't explain why he was how he was, it just represented what was important to him as a child, that he missed.
Gabe, tell us your stupid rules so we can start the game.
Oh, I'm sorry Mike, some of my folks got to hear about this one.  [texting on cell phone] Ah. [laughs]
2,336 pounds. Y'all need to learn some portion control.
That doesn't mean anything. [to Kevin] Kevin, do you want to buy cookies from me?
Um no. This is not a gym. This is like a scene out of Saw 5.
[On phone] Hello?....Justine! [laughs] Nice surprise! How you doin' baby?....Nah. No no, I didn't win. When I got promoted I stop-...what?...Yeah. Yeah, Glenn won....Oh, you wanna call him? Yeah, you should call him, congratulate him. That'll be-...What?....Oh, his number's in your old phone. Oh, you know what? I might have it right- [hangs up] Whoops.
Yeah. Just put me out of my misery.
Ok, kids. You've all been so good and unbelievably patient so I think you are gonna get some candy!
I hate goodbyes, so last week, when I left Dunder Mifflin for good, I pulled the old Irish Exit. Just slipped out without making a big deal. No hard feelings. No feelings at all.
Nothing. [pulls out a can of soda] It's mine. [Jim shakes his head] [after looking through DVR] What happened to my Tavis Smileys?
Hey, um, my daughter said you traded her a headband for her Nintendo DS?
This doesn't help me. I don't respond to that kind of strategy.
You know what you guys should do? Go to the bookstore at lunch. There's tons of cuties and it's easy to talk to them. 'Hey, what book is that? Cool, let's hang out tonight. Sex already? Whoa...'
Yes, as a matter of fact, I uh��� [pulls booklets from his bag] I wrote some down. There you go. [passes out booklets] Wow, this guy came prepared, it impresses me! [group laughs]
You know this would not happen if we had a union.
Nahh! [shakes head] No. Not Justine. Never Justine.
That's fascinating. Tell me, what's the significance of the peach orchard, thought?
Actually, Val, why don't you come with? I'll need the extra hands to carry them back.
I've been working out. But, the problem is, I've been building muscle underneath. And that top layer hasn't burned off yet. Awkward stage.
Val knit me a beanie. But I can't if it's a ���we're just friends��� beanie or a ���I'm hot, you're hot, let's get it poppin'��� beanie. So I'm gonna up the ante, give her a clearly romantic gift, and we'll get to the meaning of the beanie.
So it really bothers me when somebody comes in here speeding around on a lift, playing with it like a toy. It kind of gets under my skin.
And I'm gonna play this here share the wealth card.
Come on, stay, alright? It's good for people to get to know you.
Yeah, yeah me too. I think it���d be like��� You know what? [grabs basketball] I think it���d be like a Kevin Durant jump shot��� Perfecto! [shoots basketball at hoop on wall, basketball misses and lands in fish tank, killing the fish] Oh my god���
[Singing] rub a dub dub���I got scrubbed.  ���Sup, darlin���? Everybody, this is Justine. [murmurs of hello from the group] This is Jim and Oscar, everybody.
[leaving someone a message on his cell phone, looking very uncomfortable] Hey what's up, I just thought I'd try you. I was thinking about that story where you ran into the girl you used to babysit.
A lot has changed since y'all left, okay? You're gonna have to jump through some hoops. And the new foreman is here. Now she's one of the best we've ever known, okay? So I need you to show her your upmost respect. Make sure she feels welcome and at home, okay? Can you do that?
No, no, no, no. It's not worth it.
I didn't hire anyone if that's why you're here.
What do you want, baby? We got some granola, got some cupcakes, chips, apples, pies...
Whoa, I work at a paper company, those things terrify me. They could put us out of business, you know? I heard those machines hold like, ten books at once.
Jim was nice enough to give me his bedroom.
Uh. So I guess that was your mom who called me earlier looking for the address? Real deep voiced woman?
Okay, I'm gonna need you to make this right or else we can't be right.
How many people a year do you think get their arms cut off in a baler?
If this company���s going down, I wanna go down on it. With it. I wanna go down with it.
It's getting late. I thought you guys could use a little [sets up laptop] inspiration.
Oh, in the warehouse we use code names for people we want to talk about. Andy was Jelly Roll. Mike was Dennis the Menace. Ryan was douche bag.
Seriously, that was hot. Feel like you and the newsman had a groove going.
That's 'cause of you, Mike.  They're not gonna give the workin' man more than the boss.
Maybe the grinch hid the Christmas star, and we could ask for clues, and he'll tell us if we're hot or cold.
[in background] You have to be alert, and calm. And always careful...
I am serious, Mike.  That's a 10% raise.  That's what I want.
So I���m like a three year old girl in this scenario���
What happens when we're done chewing? Do we spit it out on the floor, or keep it in our mouths the rest of the time?
Dwight, look, I���m sorry you���re having a hard time with this, okay? Athlead is my future. No disrespect to Dunder Mifflin, but if I can have fun at work, I want that.
Sucks. Anyway, I just don't see it. The Knicks are tough.The Nets are tough.
You know, I just got Limitless on my iPad. I bet I could get it on the TV.
[freezes] Ummm��� [a moment later] Alright. Obviously y���all look really busy, and uh, I don���t want to waste your time anymore. Sorry, I just uhh��� Obviously I���m not qualified to be here man, I���m���  I���m a warehouse manager, you know���
Finish the joke, Andy. What do African Americans call?
You crushed our spirits, Gabe. Congrats. You're a big man, huh? Take a lot to destroy the creativity of a whole group of people. [notification tone] [laughter]
Well you lost zero pounds. [everyone grumbles]  No change.  On the bright side you gained zero pounds.
Man, we can see all your business coming around the corner, okay? You need to, you know, hide the... good thing you don't have a lot of business to start with.
I just did, like, 35 minutes on the treadmill.
I have a file of applicants here. I just gotta open it, look at it, interview a bunch of guys,hire some of 'em. So I'd say we're in the early stages of the process.
That stuff can come back to get you. It���s called karma. You do not want to be messing around. I got an uncle���
We are hanging out-right now. You want some more of this?
[in a dress shirt and tie] Like what?
[fake whispers to Roy] I think he feels bad.
Lightbulb's burnt out, so it's dark. And the heat from the backup generator keeps it nice and warm. Sometimes I think about it when I'm trying to fall asleep at home. But as far as the rest of the office goes, it doesn't exist, okay?
I think she could... sense my sadness, and I, and I found out too late that she... she's the copy editor at the Trib.
[Andy walks in Darryl's office] We should schedule meetings, because the days can slip away with chit-chat. Are you crying?
Yeah, totally crazy. Puts me in an insane asylum just thinking about it. I'm stranded on shutter island over here.
Sometimes it seems like it was better down in the warehouse, you know?
One second, one second, one second. [stops playing] So, this song is from the point of view of a little girl?
Yeah, I'll say something. I think we should be acknowledging our boss, because none of us would be here without him. Robert California! [everyone toasts]
No, wait. You're, you're supposed to... Never mind. Da  na na na na.
I don't understand the point of a hat.
I like the sound of that. Is Kevin in?
Actually, Andy, we call this one Dwight, Jr.
Don't use his real name. George Howard Scubb. It's a devil name.
Well, I'm sorry if it seems that way to you.
Higher. [motions with hand to go up more]
Andy, this is inappropriate. People died here, man.
Andy made me his consigliere. Which means Assistant Regional Manager. I guess he thought I'd be into The Godfather 'cause I'm black. Wrong! I'm into The Godfather 'cause I'm a cinephile. I like Scarface 'cause I'm black.
[reads text] Come to parking lot. Crazy pigeon action?
Alright, we're going down to my warehouse, that means we're playing by my rules. No messing with the baler and be cool in front of me and Val. We just broke up.
Look, I need this. Ok? Your daughter is a pretty little girl. Let her go door-to-door. You think people gonna buy cookies from my [hesitates] chubby daughter?
And we all know, baseball does not last forever.
���Mandate���- Always think of two men on a date. [awkward moment] I have gay friends��� I have one gay friend. [to Jim] Oscar?
Hey Val. Want a beer? It might taste better than that pool water you've been drinking.
Well, yeah, what can I say, a player���s gotta play.
I'm done. I gotta get out of here.
[puts newspaper down] Wow. That dude is good.
I was still thinking of going back to school.
���This coupon entitles you to one free tickle monster attack���
Okay, I'll start.  It's pretty simple really. I uh, I think I deserve a raise.  I'm scheduled to get one in six months, but I'd like that to be moved up to now.
You hired your actor friend to come here as a cop?
Nah man, we get along now.  Real well.
[singing in different tune] Out of paper, out of stock, there's friendly faces around the block, break loose from the chains that are causing your pain. Call Michael, Stanley, Jim, Dwight or Creed. Call Andy and Kelly for your business paper needs. Call Dunder Mifflin.
Well you should definitely come. The foreman always comes. Plus it's fun, you know cookies, smoked fish, alcohol, people acting stupid.
That thing were you softly exhale on her neck.
[Talks drunk angry] Jim, that guy. [Scoffs] You gotta stick to your word! Like when you say something to a buddy, a real buddy...what are you gonna do, lie? To your buddy? [Sighs] It's awful.
[claps] That was great man. Alright, I'm out of here.
I don���t care, choose amongst yourselves. Not the van though.
Hey!  How about instead of yelling at our sweet little Miss Kapoor over five hundred sheets of paper you get back to your desk.  Start sellin' multiple reams like a man.
Hooray. Live it up big D. ' 'Days like this don't come often enough. Time to celebrate. You deserve this'?
You have one more free throw shoot. Come on.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. For sure. For sure. for sure. Man!  And Pam's into it?
I told you we're way past rules. We have been for some time now. We start having rules now, everything we built collapses.
Okay, can you just stand right there?  [snaps camera phone picture] I gotta send some e-mails.
Mike, you're a very brave man.  I mean, it takes courage just to
Because you're not a daddy, and it's not your baby.
Actually, Bob Vance bought out the warehouse. So he's keeping on the whole crew. So, we good.
You want to hold me, to see how you feel?
Obviously you know how a gym works. So you know I���m not going to pay money for this. You want people to come to your gym? Make a real gym.
I don't have a plan exactly. More of a loose structure. Gives me freedom to improvise. It's like jazz. [scatting] Andy don't mess with me. [continues scatting] I'll figure something out.
And I fell and busted my ankle.  I'm legitimately scared for my workers.
[Falls backwards onto the food table] Oh! Whoa!
I got my whole life to be a minority executive. I only have about a year left in these knees, though.
[makes sudden sharp turn to the left, causing DVD player to fall out open window, then grins to camera]
I couldn't do it. I--- I ain't that strong.  And I ain't that brave.
[talking head] I'm driving them up for five times what I would've made at work. I thought I made a good deal. [expression changes from smiling to downcast] Then I realized I'm gonna be trapped in a truck with Mike all day.
This is the spookiest warehouse in the world, kids. You don't believe me? Just take a look. [Kevin chops into Erin, who is dressed as Princess Fiona] Oh. Scary, huh? This is a surgery with an octopus and a burn victim.
[bluesy] Da na na na na...  da na na na  na...
I brought those in. It's my birthday.  That's some stone-cold narcissism right there.
Man, you can't do that stuff. You'll only find pain. When my ex-wife got into my e-mail account, she was devastated.
I think if I had parents like that I'd be trying to convince everyone all the time how great I was, too.
When I worked in the warehouse, I was part of that lotto pool. They won ��� playing my birthday.
[to Val] Hey, you caught some of that?
[softly] Pieces of paper. [Jo rolls her eyes]
You mean to tell me no one wanted an energy drink for Asian homosexuals?
Alright. I mean, it's what you want, so...
You've got a booger bubble going on there.
Hey... [sighs] You know what, I could use a breath of fresh air. Let's do it.
Usually that life is short and tragic. That's okay, right?
Meredith's a little cute. I'm just realizing. She got, like, a Emma Stone thing.
Hell yeah.  You know why?  Because that was my baby.
Well, it's simple Mike. I mean we merged these two branches right?  So now we're shipping twice as many orders as we used to.  With Roy gone we got a smaller crew.  And I'm pickin' up all of his slack, so I think I should be compensated fairly, by gettin' a raise.
I���ve been meaning to join a gym. [narrating over a montage of scenes with him and Val] For my health. I used to say I wanted to live long enough to see a black President. I didn���t realize how easy that would be. So now I want to live long enough to see a really, really gay President. Or a supermodel President. I want to see all the different kinds of Presidents.
Once you read the packet, sign the back.
Yeah, I wanted the manager job, but I got somethin��� much better. This soda. This is mine.
Don't just take the first job that comes your way. Cause next thing you know, it's ten years later and you���re still there. Could write your obituary tomorrow, it's not gonna change.
I've never been lucky. And I'm not talkin' about the lottery, I'm talkin' 'bout stuff like developing a soy allergy at thirty-five. Who gets a soy allergy at thirty-five? And why is soy in everything?
So this is cool. I think we make a good fit. [stands up]
[on phone]It���s Darryl. Erin told me to pretend to be a cop and say your mom died.
Her mom wants me to take her to mass. I guess that's something to do.
Hey! He deserves this. And he said I could get in on it too.  [whispers] Yeah.
I love the desert. It's one of my favorite ecosystems.
Yeah they kind of had a specific sound that didn't really fit in with our thing.
This seems like the kind of thing white people with dreadlocks do.
I got Source Code on the way back.
Oh, it's nice, it's real nice. People get dressed up.
Ten people, Michael. Ten people.  Would you like to be one of them?
This may be wrong. But there's a limit to what I would do for my child.
I was rushing to fill an order.  I put the ladder up to grab a box of three hole from the top shelf.  Next thing I know, I'm on the ground and the ladder's on top of me.
Yeah, I'm gonna ask questions and I might not do what you say.
Pepper's been getting me out of the house, going on runs.
I was born ready! No, I suck at interviews. I had Andy���s job in the bag until my interview.
[Kevin scratches cookie order form and sniffs it] It's not a scratch-and-sniff, Kev.
It's not safe, you don't have a license.
Ahh���We don't really do those. We just sign the thing.
Well, [points at Michael] those are some awful tight pants you have on. Where'd you get em? Like Queers R Us?
Yeah, but I never said you had nothing to live for.
Uh... [looks at camera] yes?! I was. [sits back down] Little joke!
You feel connected to his baby over there?
No, he doesn't. [to Michael] I told her Santa would be here.
Look, I'm not down there anymore, so if the guys start making fun of you, you just, you gotta stand up for yourself.
I need you to sign these, we got a shipment going out.
Take it out. Pick it up. Pick it up. Pick it up. Take it out.
Everyday when I came into work, all I wanted to do was leave. So why in the world does it feel so hard to leave right now?
[to Kevin] What's a skinny guy like Toby know about cookies? You can't trust him to understand the wants and needs of the thick man. Maybe Toby from two years ago.
So, uh... here you go. [gives resume to Jim]
[on phone] Yes, there used to be a paper clip that would pop up and say 'Looks like you are writing a letter or resume. Would you like help? I believe his name was... [looks embarrassed at camera] Clippy.
I know he loves his pick up truck.
It was kind of mumbled, I don't know, uh, only thing I could make out clearly was 'Andy,' 'Problem,' 'Eliminate,' something. I don't know what it meant.
[feeding a squirrel] I'm giving him a peanut.
Jim is happy here, selling paper at Dunder Mifflin?
It's more than necessary, Mike. We need this. Roy? You still have that card from the Dockworker's Union?
Dude, I'm gonna be here all week, right? Five days a week, I figure I'll start slow.
Yeah that's true.  You gotta call your girl, and get paid.  Show her who wears the pants in the relationship.
The baler can flatten a car engine.  It can cut off your arm and crush your entire body without skipping a beat.
Figured I look presentable. [looks Michael over] You? [Michael dressed casually in jeans and sneakers] Went a different way.
Michael, you know you don't have to turn us all in. All you need is one scapegoat.
You just threw a milkshake in a restaurant where they make minimum wage.
Why don���t you come along and tell him yourself?
He gets condescending when he's nervous. Or when he's excited or sleepy. Not an easy person to be friends with.
Think about it! What other mammal, besides humans, drinks the milk of another mammal? I mean, you don't see a bear drinking raccoon milk.
Oh, this is a gift, for....my man Nate here.
I'm gonna tell Jim to go [Bleep] himself.
Her.  Yes, 'her' is qualified to work a dangerous machine.  You are not.  Okay?
My resolution is to read more. And if someone else is driving me to the bookstore, I can eat my PB&J in the car. 2011 is coming up all Darryl.
I saw a TLC show on Kate Walsh's home office. All corkboard.
Everybody knows I go to Philly. I've just been using sick days I saved up. But, Erin was so excited about being sneaky-sneaks, I went along with it.
Nice. Do the damn thing. - Pow! [they fist bump and explode]
[plays soft chords and sings]  Couldn't get outta bed today. Wish the alarm clock would go away.
Check out this song I wrote: I'ma love you downstairs tonight... [overlapping chatter]
Nope. His name is Michael. [Michael makes the da dum ksch on the drumset again]
Yes, I am. Just so everyone's on the same page.
[starts playing the tune to Seasons of Love while Andy sits down]
[driving truck] Hey, y'all are not gonna be playing these little private games all the way.
Are you wearin' lady clothes?  Those look like lady... pants.
Yeah them, and the Latin Kings... the Warriors...
When I was a kid, my grandmother used to make me chocolate cake when I wasn't feeling good. She's not around to do that anymore. I'm sorry, I just need a moment to myself just to clear my head.
I have no idea what his problem is, that's just my standard advice. It's good advice right?
No. I got some work to do. I do got big plans with this company.
Get your own raise.  You gotta get out there and earn, son.
Phyllis. This rain... does it make you wanna be doing something?
Two thousand one hundred seventy-five. [everyone moans] Sorry guys.
No, it's my plumber. Says so in his bio. Apparently the director discovered him doing karaoke. It's his first play. He didn't even audition.
[playing video game with Jim] Oh. Come on!
I love Jim. I love that he hooked me up with a job. It's just, he uses old t-shirts as wash rags. He doesn't wash his dishes. Apparently, they need to [quote-unquote fingers] soak... He hooked me up with a job.
Thank you. [Kevin grabs cookie and starts eating it]
It's like she only wants to hook up when Ryan comes around.  It's gotten to the point where I get excited every time I see that little dude walk through the door.
No, that's uh. Porn. Pornography. Old lady... nasty... porn.
Which entitles me to half of both of y'alls money so if you don't mind.
I wanted to leave quietly. It seemed dignified. But having Kevin grind up on my front while Erin pretends to hump me from behind is a more accurate tribute to my years here. I���m gonna miss these guys.
Still good. You guys lost a pound. You lost one pound.
Aw, come on. What's the harm? [makes face] Mmm. What flavor was that?
Hey, look, Pennsylvania license plate! That's crazy! All the way out here! Who can name all the states?
[as Jim empties thermos into trash] Nah, nah, nah. You don't have to do that.
We do safety training every year, or after an accident. ... We've never made it a full year.  This particular time, I was reaching for a supply box on the top shelf, when one office worker, who shall remain nameless, kicked the ladder out from under me and yelled...
Why would you think a lady is me?
That's when you hit me with what's getting you down, okay?
[entering Andy's office] Hey, man. Selling cookies for Jada. Want the same as last year?
Follow me, I got a space. After you.  I���ve been thinking about you all mornin���.  I don���t know what you did, I can barely walk today.
You don���t have to say it if you���re doing it.
No, no, I���m not here actually. These donuts are part of my escape from the guys at the warehouse I didn���t say goodbye to.
I had no idea. This plumber has pipes!
How about the sales department is the sails?
Come on, Mike, let me borrow the hat for just a couple of hours.
It's Dallas the game, we can figure it out.
We're the ones that got to clean that up!
Shhh. If we don't listen to the overture, we won't recognize the musical themes when they come back later.
No! No no no no no!  I said
Would it be more hilarious than Angela having a Chinese baby?
Yeah. Yeah, it���s hot. The music is awesome. And the tacos are���for real.
Now, this is the forklift.  You need--- [Michael rattles it] You need a license to operate this machine.  That means the upstairs office workers
No, we got a truck going out at 1:15. So, that's the busy time.
Mr. Romanko, we were a day late on one of your deliveries, but two of our trucks were down for repairs. It���s very unlikely it would happen again.
You're new to the game. You learned a lesson today. See you next year, sport.
I don't know... I thought I was enough family for my daughter.
No. Thank you for your interest in my truck.
[opening door to Deangelo's office] Hey, saw Jim come in.  We meeting?
I didn't have time because of my daughter.
I have a solid relationship with Jo, the company's owner. I have management experience. I have a good friendship with Jim, the head of the Search Committee, and it doesn't hurt that I'm... [in Oprah-like sing-song voice] bla-aaack!
You're right, it's better than you! It's us! [sings] Dunder Mifflin.
A car parked in the sun is like a toaster oven.
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa! So you're just gonna throw away perfectly good food?
Yeah, I heard. It sounds kinda lame. [to camera] No offense. You going, Toby?
Baby, if you���re watching this, you're not chubby, you're beautiful. Daddy's just got to sell some cookies. And we're also gonna exercise more. It's gonna be fun.
No, that's not a good idea. I don't see that as a very good song.
You say we're the same, but we get compensated very differently.
Looked like it. Sometimes when I'm down like this, it helps to sing the blues.
[Comes up behind Jim and puts his hands on Jim's shoulders] Ah-Ha-Ha! Philly! Exciting stuff, man.
I got too much ice cream. You want some?' 'Getting' my fry on.'
You're not as scary as Book Face, over there.
Then you gotta have muscles, man. You got some muscles? Let's see.
Every day I have a blueberry muffin. Today, I did not have a blueberry muffin. Should have had the blueberry muffin... especially considering how incredibly superstitious I am.
Hey, Mike, look. How bout we go upstairs, too. You know learn how the office works. We can all switch places today.
That's what I've been trying to tell you, Mike.  It's serious down there.  We do dangerous stuff, man.  This is shenanigans, foolishness, Nerf-ball.  You live a sweet, little, Nerf-y life.  Sittin' on your biscuit.  Never havin' to risk it.
What you say, bitch? You know, you might be right.
Holy [bleep], what? Let me see that. It's so light. Like a croissant.
Hey, just so you know, me and you��� I don't think that's ridiculous��� Dot, dot, dot��� dot, dot.
Yes, thanks to you, who promoted me, after we, uh, interfaced.
We did it! Hey, and look, the buyers wanna make sure it���s not just a Philly play, so get this: they���re gonna pay for us to go pitch out west. We talking Spurs, the Jazz, Cowboys. Blake Griffin, baby.
Here's what I'm gonna do, I'm calling corporate and I'm filing a complaint against both of you.
You just made a good idea, a great idea.
That's big of you, man. Takes a lot of courage.
Yes. All of 'em. Together. It's a conspiracy. Listen to me, Mike, you gotta do something about them.
Spot a cow, last person to say 'Jackson Five' has to get on its back and ride it.
[enters the office with his daughter, who runs in and hugs Jim] Jada, no, no, no, Jada, what are you doing? [Jim looks knowingly at the camera] Oh. So sorry, guys. I hope my family didn't disrupt your meeting.
A lot... of things.  Uh, you, uh... What about Jan?  Lovely, lovely, lovely Jan, man.  It's goin' good, right?
What? Is he retiring? You getting him a gift or something?
A restful location. Talk to Glen. He'll take you up in the lift.
You come to my house, bust up my trash cans, call my baby sister an ass****, and told her to eat dog food.
And did your brains tell you to ruin these boxes with grease?
[exits Andy's office smiling] All I need is Kevin. Dude buys more cookies than everyone combined and then some. [Kevin waves at him] When I first started selling cookies he was a relatively thin man. Not a thin man, mind you. Relatively thin.
Mike, this is barely more than I make.  You been here ten years, dog. [laughs]
Hey, y'all wanna hear some loud music or something?
Some freaky stuff going on. I was walking behind Gabe and I heard some things.
Thank God we only had a baler to deal with.
Yes. I do remember saying something like that to you.
My biggest fear is that someone will distract us from getting all the shipments out on time.
I like the sound of this. [looks at Dwight] Maybe one day I'll be sitting in Michael's chair. Wouldn't that be something?
These are very dangerous machines down here, and the upstairs workers,
I'll answer that, Jim. I would use it as an opportunity to teach, uh, about actions... and consequences... of actions. [Jim and Gabe stare at Darryl]
Look, just be straight with me, man. You can be gay with Matt, just be straight with me.
Damn! Jim, you got a real Facebook energy going on here man. You Zuckerberged this place out!
Mike, you can't do that. It's conflict of interest.
Come on man. I'm being serious. Don't joke.
Hey, man, you put together a pretty fun night for everybody. I saw you talking to Hide. Did you hear that dude's life story? It's amazing, right?
Andy, when I was twelve years old, we did a field trip, a lock-in at the zoo. I met this girl, I thought she was so perfect. I was in love with her. But when the sun came up, I knew it wasn't real, 'cause she was ugly and I had grown tired of her. I know you want reception today, but tomorrow you won't want to do her. She's a dog.
I meant dressed up compared to normal. You usually dress like a ghost-buster.
Didn't have to see. It was sales. I can feel it. They are out of control.
Andy Bernard can't squirt water in his eye and act like it doesn't freak him out. But you know who can? Older Male Lab Assistant Number One.
[Dwight and Jim enter office] Hey, hey. They're back. [Everyone greets them]
Hey, I like you.  Oh yeah, what's not to like?  But you need to access your uncrazy side, otherwise maybe this thing's run its course.
[Pam knocks on Darryl's door] Don't come in, I'm busy. [Pam opens the door]
Somebody just needs to get her attention, tell her it's not OK to do this in public.
Well, when they merged the two branches together, they put
Back at the bus.  We were locked out.  Phyllis is sitting on the ground eating a dirty sandwich.
This doesn't concern you man, you need to walk away.
We work the same hours as you and you just said we work a lot harder
All right, I'm being a jerk. You got me this job. I should be grateful. I am, I just... you know, I get finicky about my stuff. That's all.
[singing] Out of paper, out of stock, there's friendly faces around the block, break loose from the chains that are causing your pain.
How far is this place? [turns off radio]
You ready for tonight? We gonna tear up the town?
[noticing all the warehouse workers wearing homemade beanies] Wow. It's like the nation of Islam down here.
Guys, guys. That���s so vague. You gotta do the zip plus four. 1-8-5-0-5 dash 7-4-2-7.
Actually, Andy, you promised me five minutes to talk about productivity suggestions���
You made a bad call. And I fixed it. So I'm not apologizing.
What? Must���ve been another devilishly handsome debonair individual.
You're on your own, Mike. [gets up and starts to walk away]
That sounds fun, mucking around in the dump. Wish I could go.
[in a feminine voice] Hi. This is Alex.
Yeah, I did. I, I was talking to this girl at a bar.
Yeah, maybe everyone move one instrument to the right?
One of 'em, Glenn, is starting one of those fat camps where he steals your kid in the middle of the night. Madge and a couple other guys might start a strip club, but on a boat. And Heday is investing in an energy drink for Asian homosexuals. [Andy laughs awkwardly]
You got it. Pick it up. Take it out.
Mmm-hmm. [thumping] [Roy groaning] Now you've got to drink.
Oh you could stay too.  He's got a big place.
[Jim puts popcorn bag in microwave] Hey, if you don't want to teach me Power Point, just say so.
I'm not checkin' email till lunch. Four hour work week.
No, you don't. You don't feel us. How can you? You know what?
So you sure you remembered everything for your trip?
[Dwight heads toward a strip club] Oh, no, no, no. Uh-uh.
You own a convertible. Come on man that's, that's hot. Women love that stuff right?
So if I started singing ���Down By the Old Mill Stream���, you couldn't join me in a three part harmony. [Andy and Officer Foley shake their heads no, Darryl begins singing] Down by the, down by the, down by the....
I'm telling you, don't do it. I've got nothing against strip clubs, but I do have something against them at noon on a Monday. The day shift at a strip club? You can't unsee that.
Jada don't want to spend Christmas with me. She told her mom it wasn't as much fun. And how could she say that? You know, I took her to the toy store to buy her own presents.
Well, shall we make it a little interesting?
And you got half a million of these? Well I gotta try it.
It���s 30 degrees out. You drinkin��� a mildshake?
I don't know. You gonna wash it? Or you gonna let it soak?
These dudes are definitely in a weird mood. Picked the wrong day to return a truck.
[walking by with new carpet] What... What's that?  Whatcha doing?
The guy who was in here earlier, interviewed after me, how'd he do?
[looks to camera for several seconds] At least it's quiet.
Which usually means there's clothes all over the living room.
It does not say dangerous. And there's no exclamation point.
Well see, um... in the gang world, we use something called Fluffy Fingers.
Look you need to pick yourself up. Man up, alright? You will win this in the end. It's all about heart, and character. Be your best self.
I just don't get it, Pam. I mean, you're a rational person.
I haven't been to New York in a long time.
She said her name was Brandon, I think. Your mom's name is Brandon?
You're such a great friend, dot dot dot dot dot.'
All right, fine, you know what? One o'clock.
Yeah, we had a few fights, I suppose.  But last night we put a lot of that to bed.  I can���t tell you what I did with my ex wife last night���. I have to sing it.  [singing] We took a shower, we were naked. We ska dap dap doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.
Nothing stupid about working for yourself. Hanging out with pro athletes, getting free tickets to the games. That���s why I���m doing it.
Andy, it���s Darryl. Take your drawers off your head.
Hey. While I got you on the phone, your husband's like a sloppy, homeless hobo. Can you fix that?
Yeah, and then he starts tickling you. You know, pretty soon you're laughing and hugging. Before you know it, you've forgotten the whole thing. Ya'll can just go to church together... get an ice cream cone.
Hey, why don't you and me play those?
Hey I'm not gonna tell you this stuff if you gonna throw it back in my face.
They left you in the lurch, and if they want to jump in, it means you're almost there. You did this. Bring it home.
Yeah, ok so what, you buy 40 boxes?
You need to change your standard for what's worthy of a text. Ask yourself is this something Darryl needs to know. The answers almost always no.
I don't know who's got you upset but my advice is stop crying.
And I���d only get to see Jada on the weekends. You know, I���m��� I���m not so sure I���d like living in Philadelphia.
Oh my God, I think I see the imprint of a ring pop.
It's not real... until your wife is on board.
[Michael and Holly cautiously pass each other] There's another dolly in the truck, Mike. You could take more than that lamp.
Better get some decent speakers up here then, cause we���re gonna do this right.
I'll do it better than you. I earned it. I deserve it. I got passed over, God knows why, reasons I cannot and will not understand. The job was mine Andy, everyone said it was mine. Make me manager or fire me.
You should talk in a higher voice 'cause the camera makes you sound weird.
Woah-Oh! Haven���t been in one of these in forever.
Maybe I'll stay overnight.  Got a cousin lives down there.
I put some guys on tonight. Best of your bunch and my bunch. Tell you now though, it's gonna be mostly my bunch.
Oh, it works. Him and me, all right, we are crazy in love. More love than your small mind can comprehend. And we have two disposable incomes. And no kids. And we're taking our business elsewhere. [Oscar and Darryl exit holding hands]
We livin��� like rock stars. I���m about to eat free steaks with my sports heroes in 32 different cities.
OK, um, I like Erin's hair. It's a very pretty color.
Yeah, Jim's going to philly tomorrow. He said he was gonna take me with him, but that was two months ago. And I haven't heard anything since. I mean, he said that, right?
Man, see... That's what I've been sayin', man. We need to do this finally.
It's not a trash compactor!  It's a baler!
Whoa! That person has really gotten him or herself into quite a predicament.
Mike, this is the opposite of safety.  You jump, you're gonna serious hurt yourself.
Oh, come on, man. I thought you had something real.
Ohh, that sounds fun and Christmasy, you mean old grinch!
That's when somebody really gets in your face, you know, you just... start tickling them.
It's all about finding ways to make yourself more efficient. Life hacking, baby. This morning, I brushed my teeth in the shower. Saved my self 90 seconds. Which I just used to explain this to you. Damn it!
Mike, why do you have to control how he perceives it in his mind?
You mean what did we do the last time the warehouse won the lottery?
Glen, could you excuse us? [Andy slams the door after Glen leaves, panting heavily]
[chuckles in agreement] Huh ha! That's cool, man.
There were times on the two and a half hour drive when I experienced doubt. That's the thing about long drives, you know, you're always going to- this is a gay bar.
No... yes, yes. Why wouldn't I... wanna pretend to be gay? Got no problem with that.
I did. I did have a fantastic basement. Now it smells like tacos. You can't air out a basement and taco air is heavy. Settles at the lowest point.
I don't know, man. Y'all quit with a lot of confidence. I mean, it was like, y'all came up in here dancing and everybody was- [sees Val] ooh, hold on a second. [sees Brandon] Oh.
It's not just today, it's everyday. It seems like the better title I have, the stupider my job gets.
Okay, shush it. This was a mistake. Let's go. [Darryl and Jada leave, Ryan slowly shakes his head]
I feel good today. My little girl Jada? It's my turn to have her for Christmas this year. Two years ago I had her, and we had the best time. I tivoed her favorite shows, some things I've never heard of. iCarly... You know who's funny on that show? The friend with the video camera. He's got a nice way of talking.
I just think you���re going into this a little fast.
You didn't feel like he was hiding something?
[in a feminine voice] Kevin can't come to the phone right now because he's busy with us.
Mike, I'm very busy down here. [eats chicken]
Kill their fish, and they still hire me. That���s how you do that, baby. It���s all good, I���m ready. Y���all ready for this? [sings intro to ���Everybody dance now���, points to Pam to sing first line]
It's cool that you like the southwest. It's one of my favorite regions.
I'm just glad we're gonna try it out.
I'm sure they don't regret having their child, let's move it to the pros.
We just have a lot of stuff down there that could be stolen.
I don't wanna prank anymore. Things get real. It's not funny. I'm just gonna be good, stay in my room, go to church, try to do one nice thing per day. I do not wanna prank anymore.
I love it. And it���s Athleap now. And the city is amazing.
I have my daughter tonight; we're renting Charlotte's Web.
Darryl Philbin. Then Regis, then Rege, then Roger, then Mister Rogers.
Hey. Hey, look, when you get done with your... [looks inside conference room] meeting, you should, uh, come to the break room. We're having a party.
Mike, we're not shipping as much as we did last year.
Oh, yeah, I taught him a handshake, too.
I can���t really picture it. Can you... get it on there. Yeah. And maybe, get the cheeks.
Yeah, just weekends for now, but pretty soon, I���m switching over.
Oh, yeah, I need McMahon, Deion Branch to have big games or else I'm done.
Me and Val were going nowhere and if I'm gonna be working in Philly, I'm gonna need my freedom. So, I convinced Val to breakup with me. Here's how you do it. You say, 'What are you gonna do, breakup with me?' Like it's a joke, and then you gain a lot of weight.
There was a time when the only people who texted you were people you wanted to text you. Girls. And they'd all say the same thing. 'I'm coming over baby.' And I would text back 'BTB', bring that booty.
Local musician? Local legend! I used to come hear you play every week at the Deerhead.
No? OK. I don't wanna be here anymore. Fire me.
I have a kid. Last week, Jim at home? That was no vacation.
Mike claims, we're all a family isn't that right?
Let me get this straight. You lost all of it. All your winnings. A hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Uh... I have other issues. I'm terrible at math. Overweight. You- you're in great shape. A lot better shape than I am, tell you what.
How would you like it if we booed you?
Look, I heard about the office. Tough break.
What kind of chicks are you going to meet there?
I'll come with you, show you how it's done.
That's sweet Mike. Let's see here. There's a chapter, called Gum. With one sentence. Everybody likes the guy who offers him a stick of gum.
All right man, don't cry.  It's cool.  I'll let you get it for $400.
The man is paying me to take Chinese.  I will say what I need to say, and soon, I will say it in Chinese.
Ohh. Ok. I didn't realize we were doing trick questions. What's the safest way to go skiing? Don't ski! [office laughs]
Yeah, but then they moved the panel to the same weekend and the Doc crew paid to fly us in. It was kismet.
[taking photo with Jada] Let's see that smile. Go on. [waves to Val]
If you say so. Hey, good seeing you. Remember, I was never here. All right, then.
Okay, bring it home now.  And don't forget the new black man phrase I taught you.
He's not my hire, but I know who he is.
Delivered all my furniture to Philly. Hey, keep it down, though. Nobody knows I���m here.
Already on it. I ordered them by their Google trend ranking so we know who to hit first.
Oh, yes! Yes! What'd I tell you? I knew he'd turn up [holds up an iPod inside speakers] You see that? This is the greatest night of my life.
Man, you have got to be kidding me.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. Okay, I made the mistake of sneaking out of here and that���s on me. But I���m not gonna spend the rest of the day here doing stuff with you cause you���re feeling sentimental.
OK, everybody smile. Ho! You lost 31 pounds.
I've been reading the comics to my daughter since she was three years old. Not once I have used the real captions to Family Circus. That crazy family is hilarious to her for one reason: me.
It's dangerous, Michael. Come on, get off this.
Then I guess I figured out where I stand. This is a love beanie.
I put three pallets on the truck to Blue Cross once a week. They use a lot of paper.
Yeah, when are they gonna do a Labradoodle that's just Lab?
Let me... [Jim shows him the resume again, Darryl looks at it a little longer this time] Oh. Cool. [Jim gives Darryl a thumbs-up, then looks at the camera as Darryl gets up to leave]
Show business is cold. Let���s say you get a job, which you probably won���t. They���re not gonna cut you any slack. You���re meant for a job with lots and lots of slack.
Yes sir. [notices Jim's using his coffee mug]
Come on, Dwight, stop overreacting. I���m getting all my work done here. No customers have complained. Nobody even knows.
My summer, I, um, blew out my knee playing softball. Ended up watching CNN most of the time. I don't know how we're going to get out of Afghanistan. I hate the new assistant. He's only been here for a week, and I hate him.
If we sell everything but the boat, your mom should be set for about six months.
Why don't we make it more interesting? Loser buys dinner at Farley's.
And I'm telling them you guys sexually harassed my sister.
Two years ago, Andy blamed the warehouse for a late shipment that he forgot to process. We got yelled at pretty bad. Almost lost my job, and I was mad as hell at the time. But I said 'Darryl, just wait. He's a fool. There's gonna be an opportunity. Just be patient.' [smiles]
Hey, come here. You guys need to see this.
No, that's not as much fun. You know what?
Wow. Man. I hope he doesn���t regret it.
You log in sales at ten different times. If you log ���em all at once, you save a lot of time. It's called batching.
Ed Truck hired me. Jo promoted me. Gabe listened to me. All you've ever done is say no to me. I have ambition. And you kept me at the same level for years.
You feel connected to this? [hold up his back brace]
All right so the support belt. Now this one is mine. Doesn't get much use nowadays.
