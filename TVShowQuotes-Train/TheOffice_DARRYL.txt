I've been working out. But, the problem is, I've been building muscle underneath. And that top layer hasn't burned off yet. Awkward stage.
That sounds awesome!
Yeah, Jim's going to philly tomorrow. He said he was gonna take me with him, but that was two months ago. And I haven't heard anything since. I mean, he said that, right?
Everybody knows I go to Philly. I've just been using sick days I saved up. But, Erin was so excited about being sneaky-sneaks, I went along with it.
Seriously, that was hot. Feel like you and the newsman had a groove going.
[looks to camera for several seconds] At least it's quiet.
Good luck with that.
I'll put you down for shortbreads.
Okay, I'm not doing that.
Gabe, tell us your stupid rules so we can start the game.
That's okay, Mike.
This was your freshman year.
[in a feminine voice] Hi. This is Alex.
Um no. This is not a gym. This is like a scene out of Saw 5.
That was never agreed upon.
Glen, could you excuse us? [Andy slams the door after Glen leaves, panting heavily]
There's nothing out here man.
It's defense.
Mike, this is the opposite of safety.  You jump, you're gonna serious hurt yourself.
Some freaky stuff going on. I was walking behind Gabe and I heard some things.
That's what we gotta do.
Looked like it. Sometimes when I'm down like this, it helps to sing the blues.
Hmhmm.
Thank you go much.
You think you could beat me up?
All right. Thanks, man.
You did good. Real good.
It's bad.
Jim, I got my ass chewed out because one of your orders got messed up. And Andy, you said you drove him to the courthouse.
Cool.
Oh, come on, man. I thought you had something real.
[watching you tube video, laughing]
I'll come with you, show you how it's done.
Hey Andy.
Bang.
[answers phone] Hello?
We are hanging out-right now. You want some more of this?
Let me... [Jim shows him the resume again, Darryl looks at it a little longer this time] Oh. Cool. [Jim gives Darryl a thumbs-up, then looks at the camera as Darryl gets up to leave]
I put three pallets on the truck to Blue Cross once a week. They use a lot of paper.
I���m going for a walk.
No, he doesn't. [to Michael] I told her Santa would be here.
Uh huh.
I���ll take a look.
All right.
Nothing. [pulls out a can of soda] It's mine. [Jim shakes his head] [after looking through DVR] What happened to my Tavis Smileys?
Loyalty.
Alright. I mean, it's what you want, so...
Yeah, but then they moved the panel to the same weekend and the Doc crew paid to fly us in. It was kismet.
Yeah, I've seen Santa.
Oh, yeah, I taught him a handshake, too.
[to Val] Hey, you caught some of that?
You're on.
Yeah.
You just threw a milkshake in a restaurant where they make minimum wage.
They smell so bad.
What college did you go to Mike?
That felt really good, actually.
Hey!  How about instead of yelling at our sweet little Miss Kapoor over five hundred sheets of paper you get back to your desk.  Start sellin' multiple reams like a man.
Would it be more hilarious than Angela having a Chinese baby?
Who knows what the belt is for?
You talk to Wade and Colin?
Hey.
Daaaaamn! It just keeps on coming, huh?
Come on, now, Justine, look... Listen, look, I've been planning this, okay? You cannot do this, Justine.
Then you gotta have muscles, man. You got some muscles? Let's see.
[Kevin scratches cookie order form and sniffs it] It's not a scratch-and-sniff, Kev.
Like he was... covering something up? Maybe.
Think that through for a sec.
I'll answer that, Jim. I would use it as an opportunity to teach, uh, about actions... and consequences... of actions. [Jim and Gabe stare at Darryl]
That's my office.
You're not as scary as Book Face, over there.
Yeah sorry, I'm just looking for a pen.
Yeah, it's a little much.
I have my daughter tonight; we're renting Charlotte's Web.
Mm-hmm
There were times on the two and a half hour drive when I experienced doubt. That's the thing about long drives, you know, you're always going to- this is a gay bar.
Just getting a tea bag.
I was in The Whiz in high school.
OK.
[puts newspaper down] Wow. That dude is good.
Okay, bring it home now.  And don't forget the new black man phrase I taught you.
It���s not pizza.
I... I just thought you knew me.
Make that face he likes.
Hey, get off.
Look, Andy, even if your ancestors did own slaves, it wouldn't be your fault. This is only weird if you make it weird.
Look how happy he is.
Look, I heard about the office. Tough break.
Well you lost zero pounds. [everyone grumbles]  No change.  On the bright side you gained zero pounds.
You mean what did we do the last time the warehouse won the lottery?
Take your shot man!
Yeah.
But... [Val kisses Darryl]
These are very dangerous machines down here, and the upstairs workers,
How about the sales department is the sails?
But we get paid a lot less.
What?
[chuckles in agreement] Huh ha! That's cool, man.
That's it.
Well you should definitely come. The foreman always comes. Plus it's fun, you know cookies, smoked fish, alcohol, people acting stupid.
Andy, it���s Darryl. Take your drawers off your head.
So?
Dunder Mifflin.
Apt. Apt analysis, Robert.
Yes, yes, yes.
Are you wearin' lady clothes?  Those look like lady... pants.
I hate myself.
Holy [bleep], what? Let me see that. It's so light. Like a croissant.
That was cold.
I feel good today. My little girl Jada? It's my turn to have her for Christmas this year. Two years ago I had her, and we had the best time. I tivoed her favorite shows, some things I've never heard of. iCarly... You know who's funny on that show? The friend with the video camera. He's got a nice way of talking.
[entering] What are y���all doing?
Jim was nice enough to give me his bedroom.
[taking photo with Jada] Let's see that smile. Go on. [waves to Val]
Tacos.
What kind of job?
Uh... [looks at camera] yes?! I was. [sits back down] Little joke!
No, um... I have.
Show them what you brought, Mike.
Boo! Boo!
Make it happen, cap'in.
More universal.
It's not just today, it's everyday. It seems like the better title I have, the stupider my job gets.
I'm not checkin' email till lunch. Four hour work week.
Anybody wanna take a guess?  Anybody?
Hey.
Yes, I am. Just so everyone's on the same page.
Forget it, man.
Now, this is the forklift.  You need--- [Michael rattles it] You need a license to operate this machine.  That means the upstairs office workers
What's
[holding camera] Here we go.
No. You're wrong.
[Falls backwards onto the food table] Oh! Whoa!
So you sure you remembered everything for your trip?
Sure, sweetie.
Wow. Man. I hope he doesn���t regret it.
Looks that way.
Probably shouldn't tell you this, but a lotta guys in the warehouse work multiple jobs, so... we have a place.
OK, um, I like Erin's hair. It's a very pretty color.
Nah. I play for pleasure.
Well, [points at Michael] those are some awful tight pants you have on. Where'd you get em? Like Queers R Us?
He gets condescending when he's nervous. Or when he's excited or sleepy. Not an easy person to be friends with.
Thanks, man.
Hell yeah!
Yeah.
And I'm telling them you guys sexually harassed my sister.
Alright, we outta here.
Good slam.
Something wrong with the doll?
Oh, hey.
I brought those in. It's my birthday.  That's some stone-cold narcissism right there.
I'm gonna tell Jim to go [Bleep] himself.
Yeah. You too, huh?
Ahh���We don't really do those. We just sign the thing.
Well, yeah, what can I say, a player���s gotta play.
Just a couple of grown, sexy-ass roommates.
Hey! He deserves this. And he said I could get in on it too.  [whispers] Yeah.
Thank you. Thank you. No.
Look you need to pick yourself up. Man up, alright? You will win this in the end. It's all about heart, and character. Be your best self.
Thanks T-Man, later.  [fist bumps Toby}
Alright, we're going down to my warehouse, that means we're playing by my rules. No messing with the baler and be cool in front of me and Val. We just broke up.
No, no, I���m not here actually. These donuts are part of my escape from the guys at the warehouse I didn���t say goodbye to.
Jim is happy here, selling paper at Dunder Mifflin?
I'm out. And so is Toby.
Correction: we don't care.
Well see, um... in the gang world, we use something called Fluffy Fingers.
All right, I made it up.
You come to my house, bust up my trash cans, call my baby sister an ass****, and told her to eat dog food.
So this is a ten-gallon hat, huh?
[softly] Pieces of paper. [Jo rolls her eyes]
[Pam knocks on Darryl's door] Don't come in, I'm busy. [Pam opens the door]
Mike, why do you have to control how he perceives it in his mind?
What are you doing with my lunch?
Man, you can't do that stuff. You'll only find pain. When my ex-wife got into my e-mail account, she was devastated.
What you say, bitch? You know, you might be right.
Hey let's go to Poor Richard's.
It does not say dangerous. And there's no exclamation point.
Yeah, the booth is lame without it.
Hey Val. Want a beer? It might taste better than that pool water you've been drinking.
Yeah, when are they gonna do a Labradoodle that's just Lab?
And did your brains tell you to ruin these boxes with grease?
You should stop calling yourself 'baby daddy.'
Yeah that's true.  You gotta call your girl, and get paid.  Show her who wears the pants in the relationship.
This party���s tight.  The fog is cool.
Thank you. 'Congratulations, Darryl. Let's get wasted.' 'Have fun today, big guy.' 'Aww, yeah. Party time. Whoo-whoop.'
Her mom wants me to take her to mass. I guess that's something to do.
Whoa! Hold on.
Hiding from his momma.
How much did you pay for that?
Cool.
What's wrong with you?
No.
That's what I've been trying to tell you, Mike.  It's serious down there.  We do dangerous stuff, man.  This is shenanigans, foolishness, Nerf-ball.  You live a sweet, little, Nerf-y life.  Sittin' on your biscuit.  Never havin' to risk it.
I didn't say anything.
I would if I owned it and I went broke.
Toby! Dwight!  Is that them?
Look man this is a bad idea.
You chose one thing?
Oh, Mi... ! Hey, stop the video! Michael, stop it right there! Stop it right there! That's that girl from that thing. [pointing at Redheaded Actress] I banged this girl right here. This is...
Okay, I'll start.  It's pretty simple really. I uh, I think I deserve a raise.  I'm scheduled to get one in six months, but I'd like that to be moved up to now.
How much?
It has been processed.
Yeah. [music starts]
Subway sandwiches.
[sighs] I���m gonna miss the paper business.
He's got to go, Mike.
You went to Cornell?
Pepper's been getting me out of the house, going on runs.
Mike gave me a list of his top ten Springsteen songs. Three of them were Huey Lewis and the News. One was Tracy Chapman, Fast Car. And my personal favorite, Short People.
Spot a cow, last person to say 'Jackson Five' has to get on its back and ride it.
Yep. Take care.
When I was a kid, my grandmother used to make me chocolate cake when I wasn't feeling good. She's not around to do that anymore. I'm sorry, I just need a moment to myself just to clear my head.
I���m lifting.
You log in sales at ten different times. If you log ���em all at once, you save a lot of time. It's called batching.
Tell 'em your story, Hide.
I'ma call Roy, man.
You crushed our spirits, Gabe. Congrats. You're a big man, huh? Take a lot to destroy the creativity of a whole group of people. [notification tone] [laughter]
Yup.
Make a delivery.
No? OK. I don't wanna be here anymore. Fire me.
Fun.
Well, I'm sorry if it seems that way to you.
Nah man, we get along now.  Real well.
[speaking Spanish] Por favor, tequila seoor.
To the arcade.
Michael.
[reads text] Come to parking lot. Crazy pigeon action?
Andy, when I was twelve years old, we did a field trip, a lock-in at the zoo. I met this girl, I thought she was so perfect. I was in love with her. But when the sun came up, I knew it wasn't real, 'cause she was ugly and I had grown tired of her. I know you want reception today, but tomorrow you won't want to do her. She's a dog.
Dunder Mifflin.
Cheeseburger or hamburger.
Cool.
We can look into it.
If you don't mind.
I got too much ice cream. You want some?' 'Getting' my fry on.'
We did it! Hey, and look, the buyers wanna make sure it���s not just a Philly play, so get this: they���re gonna pay for us to go pitch out west. We talking Spurs, the Jazz, Cowboys. Blake Griffin, baby.
You said no to this one!
That was a good one.
Actually, Andy, you promised me five minutes to talk about productivity suggestions���
I've been reading the comics to my daughter since she was three years old. Not once I have used the real captions to Family Circus. That crazy family is hilarious to her for one reason: me.
Has that ever happened? Ever?
Here's what I'm gonna do, I'm calling corporate and I'm filing a complaint against both of you.
That sounds fun, mucking around in the dump. Wish I could go.
No, no, no. Maybe just later.
I say we have a parade.
When did I get so fat?
I didn't have time because of my daughter.
Yes. How did he do?
I'll never be sorry, not for a moment of it.
You must be pretty strong, huh?
I got it. I'm doin' it.
That's sweet Mike. Let's see here. There's a chapter, called Gum. With one sentence. Everybody likes the guy who offers him a stick of gum.
If you don't enter them immediately, you forget. What?
If we were living in Sweden, I wouldn't have to worry about this 'cause we'd have universal healthcare.
A restful location. Talk to Glen. He'll take you up in the lift.
Oh?
[Sitting outside building] Stop.
[singing] Out of paper, out of stock, there's friendly faces around the block, break loose from the chains that are causing your pain.
[To himself] Back for more, huh? [Gets up and walks towards Jim]
Yeah, but I never said you had nothing to live for.
All right, fine, you know what? One o'clock.
Da  na na na na.
It's cool. Reading's tricky sometimes.
Yeah.
I hope so. Think about this carefully. There's better lives than this one.
I���ll introduce you.
You're such a great friend.'
I'm just glad we're gonna try it out.
Yes.
Alright! [high fives Pam]
What else could you possibly be forgetting?
These dudes are definitely in a weird mood. Picked the wrong day to return a truck.
Fourteen years long.
Yeah, Jim.
Yeah, we did it.
Yes, thanks to you, who promoted me, after we, uh, interfaced.
Yes, Shawn Marion.
Who's it?
My bad.
You've got a booger bubble going on there.
It's not safe, you don't have a license.
Hey, just so you know, me and you��� I don't think that's ridiculous��� Dot, dot, dot��� dot, dot.
What kind of bread you making? Pumpernickel?
Hey, Mike.
Oh, yes! Yes! What'd I tell you? I knew he'd turn up [holds up an iPod inside speakers] You see that? This is the greatest night of my life.
Hey, Mike, look. How bout we go upstairs, too. You know learn how the office works. We can all switch places today.
[feeding a squirrel] I'm giving him a peanut.
It's more than necessary, Mike. We need this. Roy? You still have that card from the Dockworker's Union?
No. Can't let you do that Mike.
All right, I'm being a jerk. You got me this job. I should be grateful. I am, I just... you know, I get finicky about my stuff. That's all.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. Okay, I made the mistake of sneaking out of here and that���s on me. But I���m not gonna spend the rest of the day here doing stuff with you cause you���re feeling sentimental.
[starts playing the tune to Seasons of Love while Andy sits down]
Oh, my bad. Goodbye, everybody.
Hey, let's call this what it is.
[reads text] 'Are you watching this?' Seriously?
You could go downstairs and ask them?
It's Lejon Brames.
Thank you.
I have plans later.
That's my go-to thermos. That's all.
There you go.
It was kind of mumbled, I don't know, uh, only thing I could make out clearly was 'Andy,' 'Problem,' 'Eliminate,' something. I don't know what it meant.
Yes, as a matter of fact, I uh��� [pulls booklets from his bag] I wrote some down. There you go. [passes out booklets] Wow, this guy came prepared, it impresses me! [group laughs]
OK, great.
I love it. And it���s Athleap now. And the city is amazing.
[as Jim empties thermos into trash] Nah, nah, nah. You don't have to do that.
[makes sudden sharp turn to the left, causing DVD player to fall out open window, then grins to camera]
Hey, y'all wanna hear some loud music or something?
Happy hour. My pleasure.
[on the phone] I just, no, she be talking to your mom or something. This is my daughter too, Justine! You seem to think, [Justine hangs up] oh... pick a damn tree already.
Man, you have got to be kidding me.
It's not even a thought���
I was still thinking of going back to school.
No.
You're right, it's better than you! It's us! [sings] Dunder Mifflin.
I'll come with you.
Once you read the packet, sign the back.
Are you kidding? You wait.
Hey, man. How are you doing? I, um���I didn���t call ���cause I figured you changed the number.
All right, what's up Mike?
I have no idea what his problem is, that's just my standard advice. It's good advice right?
[On phone] Hello?....Justine! [laughs] Nice surprise! How you doin' baby?....Nah. No no, I didn't win. When I got promoted I stop-...what?...Yeah. Yeah, Glenn won....Oh, you wanna call him? Yeah, you should call him, congratulate him. That'll be-...What?....Oh, his number's in your old phone. Oh, you know what? I might have it right- [hangs up] Whoops.
Too late.
Huh?
We good.
[Claps his hands once, spins around] Whoo!
You want me to invite Matt?
My biggest fear is that someone will distract us from getting all the shipments out on time.
I taught Mike some, uh, phrases to help with his interracial conversations. You know, stuff like, 'Fleece it out.' 'Going mach five.' 'Dinkin' flicka.' You know, things us Negroes say.
I don't wanna prank anymore. Things get real. It's not funny. I'm just gonna be good, stay in my room, go to church, try to do one nice thing per day. I do not wanna prank anymore.
No, we got a truck going out at 1:15. So, that's the busy time.
Thank you. [Kevin grabs cookie and starts eating it]
Damn!
I hate goodbyes, so last week, when I left Dunder Mifflin for good, I pulled the old Irish Exit. Just slipped out without making a big deal. No hard feelings. No feelings at all.
Here is an old man and a goth dude... and then the old crone from Drag Me to Hell.
Hey, what's up?
Hang on little ladies. You don't need this thing, I'll go grab my synthesizer. [Everyone cheers]
[to Val] You know, I don't think I've ever been in this exact angle before. I was scared at first, but I like it.
There was a time when the only people who texted you were people you wanted to text you. Girls. And they'd all say the same thing. 'I'm coming over baby.' And I would text back 'BTB', bring that booty.
I don't know. You gonna wash it? Or you gonna let it soak?
[in a dress shirt and tie] Like what?
Send me one too.
Sucks. Anyway, I just don't see it. The Knicks are tough.The Nets are tough.
Taking a load off huh?
[setting stopwatch] Go.
Kill their fish, and they still hire me. That���s how you do that, baby. It���s all good, I���m ready. Y���all ready for this? [sings intro to ���Everybody dance now���, points to Pam to sing first line]
No, no, no...
This thing could take your arm off, your head off, you know, just exercise caution.
[Singing] rub a dub dub���I got scrubbed.  ���Sup, darlin���? Everybody, this is Justine. [murmurs of hello from the group] This is Jim and Oscar, everybody.
Next exit isn't for five miles.
A lot has changed since y'all left, okay? You're gonna have to jump through some hoops. And the new foreman is here. Now she's one of the best we've ever known, okay? So I need you to show her your upmost respect. Make sure she feels welcome and at home, okay? Can you do that?
It���s 30 degrees out. You drinkin��� a mildshake?
Yeah, I heard. It sounds kinda lame. [to camera] No offense. You going, Toby?
Paper business.
Let���s get a drink in you, huh?
Hey Michael. This ain't over.
I would.
Take them at the same time.
You know what you guys should do? Go to the bookstore at lunch. There's tons of cuties and it's easy to talk to them. 'Hey, what book is that? Cool, let's hang out tonight. Sex already? Whoa...'
Man, we can see all your business coming around the corner, okay? You need to, you know, hide the... good thing you don't have a lot of business to start with.
Great.
I'll do it better than you. I earned it. I deserve it. I got passed over, God knows why, reasons I cannot and will not understand. The job was mine Andy, everyone said it was mine. Make me manager or fire me.
How about you, man.  Comfortable?
This doesn't help me. I don't respond to that kind of strategy.
Do you understand that?
Yes sir. Thanks.
Let me see it!
Finish the joke, Andy. What do African Americans call?
Hey I'm not gonna tell you this stuff if you gonna throw it back in my face.
Congratulations, baby!
No, no, no, no. It's not worth it.
You a baby daddy?
Yeah. Can Dunder Mifflin afford that?
No.
Go ahead.
That bothers me too.
I know he loves his pick up truck.
[rubs face in exasperation]
Mike, we're not shipping as much as we did last year.
Three Kings.
You hired your actor friend to come here as a cop?
I thought you'd wear a sweater.
This doesn't concern you man, you need to walk away.
You didn't have to boo him.
Why don���t you come along and tell him yourself?
Oh you could stay too.  He's got a big place.
Come on, Mike, let me borrow the hat for just a couple of hours.
Popsicles?
Yeah, maybe everyone move one instrument to the right?
They left you in the lurch, and if they want to jump in, it means you're almost there. You did this. Bring it home.
[walking by with new carpet] What... What's that?  Whatcha doing?
Yes sir.  Remember that.  I'll be right outside if you need me
He died.
You're not staying?
Yup.
I know it's hard Mike. Break-ups hurt.
No, that's uh. Porn. Pornography. Old lady... nasty... porn.
You know what? It's your first time, let's split the office. You can have sales, the annex, Creed, and I don't know I'll just take, uh, accounting.
Are you wearin' lady clothes?
You want to hold me, to see how you feel?
Thanks man.
No. I was clearing my throat.
Hell yeah.  You know why?  Because that was my baby.
Damn!
I wasn't.
I have a file of applicants here. I just gotta open it, look at it, interview a bunch of guys,hire some of 'em. So I'd say we're in the early stages of the process.
But you want me to put it back in the truck.
You know, I just got Limitless on my iPad. I bet I could get it on the TV.
How many people a year do you think get their arms cut off in a baler?
Is she sick? How are her poops?
Everybody got a government cow.
Whoa. I hadn't even thought of that.
Sometimes it seems like it was better down in the warehouse, you know?
One, two, three, hit it.
Yes.
Yeah, I'm gonna ask questions and I might not do what you say.
You're not talking... triple digits?
Oh yeah.
Close the door.
Yep.
Cool.
I can go get us some tacos.
Hey, Pam! How are you?
My resolution is to read more. And if someone else is driving me to the bookstore, I can eat my PB&J in the car. 2011 is coming up all Darryl.
She's six.
Come on, Dwight, stop overreacting. I���m getting all my work done here. No customers have complained. Nobody even knows.
Higher. [motions with hand to go up more]
You can owe me.
Hey, are we doing this thing?
Eat. It.
Ohh. Ok. I didn't realize we were doing trick questions. What's the safest way to go skiing? Don't ski! [office laughs]
Yes sir. [notices Jim's using his coffee mug]
I hate that too.
I can't--- what, Mike?  Are you---
Curl up with your favorite DVD.
No.
It's not real... until your wife is on board.
Actually, Andy, we call this one Dwight, Jr.
I loved it.
Dude.
I'm telling you how to do this man.
I put some guys on tonight. Best of your bunch and my bunch. Tell you now though, it's gonna be mostly my bunch.
[freezes] Ummm��� [a moment later] Alright. Obviously y���all look really busy, and uh, I don���t want to waste your time anymore. Sorry, I just uhh��� Obviously I���m not qualified to be here man, I���m���  I���m a warehouse manager, you know���
She was about to turn 97.
No, that's not as much fun. You know what?
Oh [bleep] yeah.
I am serious, Mike.  That's a 10% raise.  That's what I want.
Who knows?
Hey. While I got you on the phone, your husband's like a sloppy, homeless hobo. Can you fix that?
Da  na na na na .
Oh, in the warehouse we use code names for people we want to talk about. Andy was Jelly Roll. Mike was Dennis the Menace. Ryan was douche bag.
There's information here? Yeah, you're right, I don't need this.
All right.
Dreaming he's a dog on a island.
Maybe I'll stay overnight.  Got a cousin lives down there.
All right so the support belt. Now this one is mine. Doesn't get much use nowadays.
Come on, stay, alright? It's good for people to get to know you.
You���re a bad man Andy Bernard.
My priority is safety.
I'm very busy with time-sensitive work.
I can���t really picture it. Can you... get it on there. Yeah. And maybe, get the cheeks.
[laughs] That's a text. [high fives Andy]
You know.
I think if I had parents like that I'd be trying to convince everyone all the time how great I was, too.
What?
Yeah, sure, sure. I'll be right in.
Aw, come on. What's the harm? [makes face] Mmm. What flavor was that?
Yeah.
Rachel from the party?
How far is this place? [turns off radio]
What?! Really?
So this is cool. I think we make a good fit. [stands up]
Okay, shush it. This was a mistake. Let's go. [Darryl and Jada leave, Ryan slowly shakes his head]
Yeah.
Uh... I have other issues. I'm terrible at math. Overweight. You- you're in great shape. A lot better shape than I am, tell you what.
Woah-Oh! Haven���t been in one of these in forever.
Tracee Ellis Ross. Daughter of the First Lady of Motown, Diana Ross.
Mike. Get off of the lift. Please. Come on now.
That's what we need.
And I will take you all down.
Actually, you did.
I know who did that.
What?  I can't hear you.
Your girlfriend? Is your girlfriend Val?
Right.
We got an offer on the table.
What do you mean ���they left���?
That there's a woman's suit.
Cool.
Anybody?
Two thousand one hundred seventy-five. [everyone moans] Sorry guys.
You should talk in a higher voice 'cause the camera makes you sound weird.
Sure.
[Low singing] Old, mill, stream.
Still no plan.
That's good.
I did. I did have a fantastic basement. Now it smells like tacos. You can't air out a basement and taco air is heavy. Settles at the lowest point.
J-j-j-ju...
[At Meredtith] Boo!
I agree. I think it's superb.
Hold up, I'm looking at my spit with a microscope.
[plays soft chords and sings]  Couldn't get outta bed today. Wish the alarm clock would go away.
That could work.
Nine first.
[as Cookie Monster] Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum.
Yeah, I taught Mike some new phrases.  I want him to get the raise, I... just can't help myself.
We're going skating.
Please...
Didn't have to see. It was sales. I can feel it. They are out of control.
Obviously you know how a gym works. So you know I���m not going to pay money for this. You want people to come to your gym? Make a real gym.
Mike, I am not having fire-eaters in a paper warehouse.
Help me!
[Dwight heads toward a strip club] Oh, no, no, no. Uh-uh.
Nice. Do the damn thing. - Pow! [they fist bump and explode]
This is embarrassing, Michael.
I like the sound of this. [looks at Dwight] Maybe one day I'll be sitting in Michael's chair. Wouldn't that be something?
[scores] Here we go. Here we go. Here we go.
And I'm gonna play this here share the wealth card.
That's what I'm talking about!
The winner: under 'Special Skills,' Mr. Don Feiner put 'Juggling.' [laughter]
Still good. You guys lost a pound. You lost one pound.
[to Jim] What are you doing?
Be quiet.
We livin��� like rock stars. I���m about to eat free steaks with my sports heroes in 32 different cities.
No, I'm good. Keep them.
Condoms.
We should play it.
Thinking about my grandmother a lot.
Kelly ordered this online.
Welcome to the warehouse.
It's cool really.
Correct.
Hell yeah, yeah, yeah. Mo'fo, mo'fo.
Delivered all my furniture to Philly. Hey, keep it down, though. Nobody knows I���m here.
You own a convertible. Come on man that's, that's hot. Women love that stuff right?
Roy left years ago. What's his name?
Daaamn!  Mad respect for my brotha!
[interrupting] Stop talking 'bout it. I said I'm fine with it.
So how was the drive in?
Really? That is messed up man.
I had to. I needed defense.
Meredith's a little cute. I'm just realizing. She got, like, a Emma Stone thing.
Heading to Philly. Interview with Jim���s company.
It's one of my favorite regions? Did I just sound totally lame? No, I sounded good.
Darryl is dating Val... still.
That's 'cause of you, Mike.  They're not gonna give the workin' man more than the boss.
I believe I want to go home.
I got my whole life to be a minority executive. I only have about a year left in these knees, though.
Hey, um, my daughter said you traded her a headband for her Nintendo DS?
No.
Hooray. Live it up big D. ' 'Days like this don't come often enough. Time to celebrate. You deserve this'?
Oh my goodness.
I just don't get it, Pam. I mean, you're a rational person.
Think about it! What other mammal, besides humans, drinks the milk of another mammal? I mean, you don't see a bear drinking raccoon milk.
Good morning.
[exits Andy's office smiling] All I need is Kevin. Dude buys more cookies than everyone combined and then some. [Kevin waves at him] When I first started selling cookies he was a relatively thin man. Not a thin man, mind you. Relatively thin.
What?
So if I started singing ���Down By the Old Mill Stream���, you couldn't join me in a three part harmony. [Andy and Officer Foley shake their heads no, Darryl begins singing] Down by the, down by the, down by the....
What have you done for me?
I didn't say 'a'ight.'
Give me your job.
My summer, I, um, blew out my knee playing softball. Ended up watching CNN most of the time. I don't know how we're going to get out of Afghanistan. I hate the new assistant. He's only been here for a week, and I hate him.
Hey... [sighs] You know what, I could use a breath of fresh air. Let's do it.
Look, I need this. Ok? Your daughter is a pretty little girl. Let her go door-to-door. You think people gonna buy cookies from my [hesitates] chubby daughter?
[in the bathroom with Robert[ Yeah, I guess sometimes I have nightmares about being buried alive.
I included some time saving ideas...
So you still missing Ryan?
Cool. It should be taller though, right?
Mmm-hmm. [thumping] [Roy groaning] Now you've got to drink.
Look, just be straight with me, man. You can be gay with Matt, just be straight with me.
Who?
Song's about truth.
Chill, man. This plan is airtight.
No.
[approaches Kevin] Would you like to buy some cookies?
Don't don't bother Luke. Got it.
It's not a trash compactor!  It's a baler!
No.
Are you serious?
Just a hunch. Your gift is on the way.
Which entitles me to half of both of y'alls money so if you don't mind.
Pick it up.
Oh, yeah, I need McMahon, Deion Branch to have big games or else I'm done.
You got it. Pick it up. Take it out.
Maybe forever. Anyhow���
I had no idea. This plumber has pipes!
You don���t have to say it if you���re doing it.
What have you done for me?
Yep.
The space dust does it.
OK.
Here we go. Go get him, Mike!
How would you like it if we booed you?
Yes, I love Philly! Two-One-Five or die!
Dracula.
Mike, you can't do that. It's conflict of interest.
Damn that was cold.
Damn! Jim, you got a real Facebook energy going on here man. You Zuckerberged this place out!
That was you.
I saw a TLC show on Kate Walsh's home office. All corkboard.
And replay.
Hey, I like you.  Oh yeah, what's not to like?  But you need to access your uncrazy side, otherwise maybe this thing's run its course.
What? [Jim shrugs] How about yesterday?
Stupidest thing I've ever heard.
Yeah. Just put me out of my misery.
Nope. His name is Michael. [Michael makes the da dum ksch on the drumset again]
I don't know... I thought I was enough family for my daughter.
Who needs it?
I know, right.  Merry Christmas.
Again, never agreed upon.
Follow me, I got a space. After you.  I���ve been thinking about you all mornin���.  I don���t know what you did, I can barely walk today.
And you got half a million of these? Well I gotta try it.
Already on it. I ordered them by their Google trend ranking so we know who to hit first.
[Jim puts popcorn bag in microwave] Hey, if you don't want to teach me Power Point, just say so.
127 hours. It's about this guy who-
Exactly like this.
Excuse me?
Nah, nah...
What's it say?
Let me see it.
What'd I tell you about building forts in my warehouse?
Uh uh uh. Don't shush me.
My pleasure.
We're the ones that got to clean that up!
The baler can flatten a car engine.  It can cut off your arm and crush your entire body without skipping a beat.
Baby, if you���re watching this, you're not chubby, you're beautiful. Daddy's just got to sell some cookies. And we're also gonna exercise more. It's gonna be fun.
Come on, be for real Mike.
I'm telling you, don't do it. I've got nothing against strip clubs, but I do have something against them at noon on a Monday. The day shift at a strip club? You can't unsee that.
Yeah, you should.
I asked for a list. [Dwight rides in on a tricycle, laughing diabolically] ...and a clown.
You have one more free throw shoot. Come on.
That's not a good reason.
You're gonna be missing out on some good ideas.
Take it all the way up to your lip, yeah.
Right in here?
Hey, why don't you and me play those?
Really?
Let me put my shoes on. [hangs up phone, dial tone]
This is the last of it.
I don't
This... [removes camera headset]
[in background] You have to be alert, and calm. And always careful...
We just have a lot of stuff down there that could be stolen.
[tears welling up in his eyes]
Hey, I think this guy playing Sweeney Todd is my plumber.
That���s what I���m talkin��� about.
Check out this song I wrote: I'ma love you downstairs tonight... [overlapping chatter]
We do safety training every year, or after an accident. ... We've never made it a full year.  This particular time, I was reaching for a supply box on the top shelf, when one office worker, who shall remain nameless, kicked the ladder out from under me and yelled...
Shh! Movie's almost over.
I just think you���re going into this a little fast.
Ten people, Michael. Ten people.  Would you like to be one of them?
Thanks. [to Val] Nice flowers.
I was there. That dude is not engaged. I'm not a big believer in therapy, but I'll go into my own pocket to cover his co-pay.
What do we have here?
���Mandate���- Always think of two men on a date. [awkward moment] I have gay friends��� I have one gay friend. [to Jim] Oscar?
What's up man? I'm Darryl.
You feel connected to his baby over there?
I���ve been meaning to join a gym. [narrating over a montage of scenes with him and Val] For my health. I used to say I wanted to live long enough to see a black President. I didn���t realize how easy that would be. So now I want to live long enough to see a really, really gay President. Or a supermodel President. I want to see all the different kinds of Presidents.
You accept these terms?
I didn't hire anyone if that's why you're here.
Boo! Boo!
Nobody told me what people were, alright? So...  label yourselves or take what you get.
[to camera] There it is.
Yeah, I did. I, I was talking to this girl at a bar.
I'll take him.
Uh. So I guess that was your mom who called me earlier looking for the address? Real deep voiced woman?
Mike.
It's trivia.
Sounds great.
I love the desert. It's one of my favorite ecosystems.
[clapping] You got this, Roy. [Roy begins playing and singing She's Got a Way by Billy Joel, Pam and Jim looked shocked, Phyllis and Bob begin making out]
Which me am I gonna be today?
I have a solid relationship with Jo, the company's owner. I have management experience. I have a good friendship with Jim, the head of the Search Committee, and it doesn't hurt that I'm... [in Oprah-like sing-song voice] bla-aaack!
I don't know, man, they might think we're drag queens.
Action!
Both.
Here you go.
What's under your shirt?
Val knit me a beanie. But I can't if it's a ���we're just friends��� beanie or a ���I'm hot, you're hot, let's get it poppin'��� beanie. So I'm gonna up the ante, give her a clearly romantic gift, and we'll get to the meaning of the beanie.
What you need flour for, Jim?
You know this would not happen if we had a union.
Oh, no. I mean, I want to, I just...I don't want to force you into something you don't want to do.
Right there.
She's trying.
Iverson. Yeah, always man. It's very important.
Well, it���s been great.
Michael, you know you don't have to turn us all in. All you need is one scapegoat.
I got a game. Cow surfing.
That's big of you, man. Takes a lot of courage.
Thank you.
What's up, Roy?
And I fell and busted my ankle.  I'm legitimately scared for my workers.
You gotta include me in the conversation.
Yeah, this isn't happening.
Local musician? Local legend! I used to come hear you play every week at the Deerhead.
What the hell is wrong with you?
Yes.
Um, where did you get that story?
Yeah, she ended things.
If this company���s going down, I wanna go down on it. With it. I wanna go down with it.
You!
Obviously, so happy for them both.
How do I do that?
Yeah. Yeah, it���s hot. The music is awesome. And the tacos are���for real.
You don't say?
Yeah. We're cool.
Nice scatting, man.
I don't know.
Hey, man, you put together a pretty fun night for everybody. I saw you talking to Hide. Did you hear that dude's life story? It's amazing, right?
Uh oh, look at this. Red plastic cup, red plastic cup. How about that?
I'm not sleeping with your girlfriend.
Yeah where is it?
Da  na na na na.
That's crazy money. I'll take forty.
Alright.
Yeah, yeah me too. I think it���d be like��� You know what? [grabs basketball] I think it���d be like a Kevin Durant jump shot��� Perfecto! [shoots basketball at hoop on wall, basketball misses and lands in fish tank, killing the fish] Oh my god���
So it really bothers me when somebody comes in here speeding around on a lift, playing with it like a toy. It kind of gets under my skin.
You need to get back on top.
That's your new standard.
Actually, that was the sound of me eating spaghetti. But I���m gonna let them think the other thing.
Mmhmm. [points at gabe] Caramel soy latte.
Lightbulb's burnt out, so it's dark. And the heat from the backup generator keeps it nice and warm. Sometimes I think about it when I'm trying to fall asleep at home. But as far as the rest of the office goes, it doesn't exist, okay?
Oh, oh, I���m sure we did.
I think she could... sense my sadness, and I, and I found out too late that she... she's the copy editor at the Trib.
Which usually means there's clothes all over the living room.
Jada don't want to spend Christmas with me. She told her mom it wasn't as much fun. And how could she say that? You know, I took her to the toy store to buy her own presents.
Seriously?
Hello, hello.
You popped one kernel.
Dwight, look, I���m sorry you���re having a hard time with this, okay? Athlead is my future. No disrespect to Dunder Mifflin, but if I can have fun at work, I want that.
Good morning.
Hey. Hey, look, when you get done with your... [looks inside conference room] meeting, you should, uh, come to the break room. We're having a party.
I usually watch TV during my lunch breaks. It's cool?
Hi.
Stairs. Oh, man....
It���s ok E-Dog, just who called?
No no no no.  I like her.
Yeah, I guess���
Should you drive the forklift?
I told you we're way past rules. We have been for some time now. We start having rules now, everything we built collapses.
[in a feminine voice] Kevin can't come to the phone right now because he's busy with us.
Yeah.
You're new to the game. You learned a lesson today. See you next year, sport.
If you loan me some money.
Hey.
You too... Darryl.
He's not my hire, but I know who he is.
Your mom?
You're on your own, Mike. [gets up and starts to walk away]
Yeah, ok so what, you buy 40 boxes?
You wanna make me happy? Huh?
Dunder Mifflin.
Thank you.
There is no occasion for you to go near this stuff, okay?
Yeah, I wanted the manager job, but I got somethin��� much better. This soda. This is mine.
Then I guess I figured out where I stand. This is a love beanie.
[leaving someone a message on his cell phone, looking very uncomfortable] Hey what's up, I just thought I'd try you. I was thinking about that story where you ran into the girl you used to babysit.
I'm sure they don't regret having their child, let's move it to the pros.
Hey.
Dude, I'm gonna be here all week, right? Five days a week, I figure I'll start slow.
One of 'em, Glenn, is starting one of those fat camps where he steals your kid in the middle of the night. Madge and a couple other guys might start a strip club, but on a boat. And Heday is investing in an energy drink for Asian homosexuals. [Andy laughs awkwardly]
What up?
Pam.
Yes. All of 'em. Together. It's a conspiracy. Listen to me, Mike, you gotta do something about them.
Hey, come here. You guys need to see this.
Mmmmm.
Sounds all right.
Were the boxes near each other?
Oh, hey. Hey, what���s up, y���all?
No.
Hey, Andy.
One second, one second, one second. [stops playing] So, this song is from the point of view of a little girl?
What's his name?
Mike.
Wade said we could do the whole country in three months.
Sold! To Jim.
Paper material, ma'am.
Wow. Yeah, we gonna read it.
Why is the forklift in the wall?
Maybe the grinch hid the Christmas star, and we could ask for clues, and he'll tell us if we're hot or cold.
Silent. Look, congratulations.
Cannonball! [jumps in pool] Let's do this!
[sighs] Maybe, sweetheart. Single dad. Challenges.
I can't. You know that.
Cool. Hey, thanks���
You mean to tell me no one wanted an energy drink for Asian homosexuals?
You know, get it right.
Hey, Devil's Den is that way, we should check it out. That's where the snipers hid.
[enters the office with his daughter, who runs in and hugs Jim] Jada, no, no, no, Jada, what are you doing? [Jim looks knowingly at the camera] Oh. So sorry, guys. I hope my family didn't disrupt your meeting.
Okay.
Dwight, come back and spot me.
This is too good.
Shhh. If we don't listen to the overture, we won't recognize the musical themes when they come back later.
Because I wanted you to like me.
All right, got it. 2,210 pounds.
All right, this is just messed up.
Nahh! [shakes head] No. Not Justine. Never Justine.
A car parked in the sun is like a toaster oven.
Oh yeah.
Okay. I'll keep working.
Every day.
No. Thank you for your interest in my truck.
[Comes up behind Jim and puts his hands on Jim's shoulders] Ah-Ha-Ha! Philly! Exciting stuff, man.
I'm done. I gotta get out of here.
This is not a good idea right here.
[pats Andy on the back] Thank you.
I was born ready! No, I suck at interviews. I had Andy���s job in the bag until my interview.
[Andy walks in Darryl's office] We should schedule meetings, because the days can slip away with chit-chat. Are you crying?
This is the spookiest warehouse in the world, kids. You don't believe me? Just take a look. [Kevin chops into Erin, who is dressed as Princess Fiona] Oh. Scary, huh? This is a surgery with an octopus and a burn victim.
I haven't been to New York in a long time.
Unh! Damn it!
I'm very busy here, man.
Oh, yeah?
Eat it.
Ok, kids. You've all been so good and unbelievably patient so I think you are gonna get some candy!
Ok, so um, what's his name? All the way in the back there.
Hey.
That doesn't mean anything. [to Kevin] Kevin, do you want to buy cookies from me?
We're friends. We're friends.
And?
If you say so. Hey, good seeing you. Remember, I was never here. All right, then.
Val. You made it.
[Dwight and Jim enter office] Hey, hey. They're back. [Everyone greets them]
And the game's over seconds later.
Yeah, that���s crazy.
I can videotape it.
You just made a good idea, a great idea.
What? Wait, wait, wait? So what? This happening?
No big deal. No big deal.
Why, did you meet someone?
Oh, thanks. Thanks. No.
OK, don't fire me.
Yes. I do remember saying something like that to you.
2,336 pounds. Y'all need to learn some portion control.
The guys did invite me out to celebrate but I decided to just stay home. Eat a bunch of tacos in my basement.
I worked at a Jiffy Lube.
The coconut's pretty subtle.
Get your own raise.  You gotta get out there and earn, son.
Go, Dwight Jr!
Back at the bus.  We were locked out.  Phyllis is sitting on the ground eating a dirty sandwich.
Everyone, we have a voluntary meeting in the conference room to discuss Erin's confidence.
It's not a race.
That stuff can come back to get you. It���s called karma. You do not want to be messing around. I got an uncle���
Mike you'll drive this every weekend?
When I worked in the warehouse, I was part of that lotto pool. They won ��� playing my birthday.
And we all know, baseball does not last forever.
Da  na na na na.
Yes! [to video screen]  Right here. You are a naughty girl!
You really re-did Andy's office, huh?
Da  na na na na.  No, no, check it out, look. Da  na na na na... want to do that?
There you go.
I love Jim. I love that he hooked me up with a job. It's just, he uses old t-shirts as wash rags. He doesn't wash his dishes. Apparently, they need to [quote-unquote fingers] soak... He hooked me up with a job.
I don't know, man. Y'all quit with a lot of confidence. I mean, it was like, y'all came up in here dancing and everybody was- [sees Val] ooh, hold on a second. [sees Brandon] Oh.
Perfect.
I can hear you.
Yeah, well, watcha gonna do?
Why?
Apparently we have a visitor. Gabe, everyone.
[noticing Erin in the background leading a black man dressed in a suit through the office] Who's that?
I don't know who's got you upset but my advice is stop crying.
That's when you hit me with what's getting you down, okay?
[Talks drunk angry] Jim, that guy. [Scoffs] You gotta stick to your word! Like when you say something to a buddy, a real buddy...what are you gonna do, lie? To your buddy? [Sighs] It's awful.
[sighs]
We'll go after Darth then.
2,184 pounds, for a grand total -- oh! You all gained five pounds back.
Ho-ho!
This is what you want?
[playing ping-pong] Game, son!
I'm back together with Val. Yay...
Okay, can you just stand right there?  [snaps camera phone picture] I gotta send some e-mails.
Right on, son.
Hope it's all right.
She said her name was Brandon, I think. Your mom's name is Brandon?
You remember? Yes!
Hey! Do Not Touch My Radio.
What's wrong with a level playing field?
It's cool that you like the southwest. It's one of my favorite regions.
Oh, this is a gift, for....my man Nate here.
You haven't even introduced yourself.
That thing were you softly exhale on her neck.
A lot... of things.  Uh, you, uh... What about Jan?  Lovely, lovely, lovely Jan, man.  It's goin' good, right?
He does not like that wall.
Me.
No, no, no.
Then I think you should fire me.
It's real bad.
Da  na na na na!!
The experience...
I didn���t realize we were this close.
I'm sitting right here.
Scoopity-splash!
Can���t do what?
YEAH! Da  na na na na.
It can.
Why don't we make it more interesting? Loser buys dinner at Farley's.
Sup?
Come on man. I'm being serious. Don't joke.
Dallas indeed.
WHAT!?
I'll take one of those pink pouches.
Thanks, man.
Uh weight lifting yeah.
But you're singing it.
Something full of acid.
Summing up.
What? You making bread?
Cool. Okay. Sorry I lied.
I don't have a plan exactly. More of a loose structure. Gives me freedom to improvise. It's like jazz. [scatting] Andy don't mess with me. [continues scatting] I'll figure something out.
We wanted to give you something.
Wrap it up, Gabe.
You could be.
All right man, don't cry.  It's cool.  I'll let you get it for $400.
Well, shall we make it a little interesting?
You need to change your standard for what's worthy of a text. Ask yourself is this something Darryl needs to know. The answers almost always no.
Well, it's effective.
[driving truck] Hey, y'all are not gonna be playing these little private games all the way.
Uh��� yeah. Depending on traffic.
Mike.
Come on! Just show me the Power Point.
[bluesy] Da na na na na...  da na na na  na...
I have a kid. Last week, Jim at home? That was no vacation.
You���re gonna po��� mouth
Clever, Mike.
I know Citizen Kane. Rosebud didn't explain why he was how he was, it just represented what was important to him as a child, that he missed.
Thanks, it's cool. So...
Comfortable, Mike?
I don���t think I sh-
Good policy. Sensible. Smart.
[on phone]It���s Darryl. Erin told me to pretend to be a cop and say your mom died.
It's so strong.
���This coupon entitles you to one free tickle monster attack���
Why? 'Cause I'm from the hood?
[fake whispers to Roy] I think he feels bad.
This trip was longer than I thought.
Kind of embarassing.
Hey what's up? You called?
If we sell everything but the boat, your mom should be set for about six months.
Dwight!
Andy made me his consigliere. Which means Assistant Regional Manager. I guess he thought I'd be into The Godfather 'cause I'm black. Wrong! I'm into The Godfather 'cause I'm a cinephile. I like Scarface 'cause I'm black.
Except my warehouse.
Yeah.
My future's not gonna be determined by seven little white lotto balls. It's gonna be determined by two big black balls. I control my destiny. I do.
I need you to sign these, we got a shipment going out.
What?
Life hacking, man.
Put it on, man.
It's dangerous, Michael. Come on, get off this.
All right, let���s get this over with.
Dwight.
The man is paying me to take Chinese.  I will say what I need to say, and soon, I will say it in Chinese.
Slow down, think it over.
Whoa, I work at a paper company, those things terrify me. They could put us out of business, you know? I heard those machines hold like, ten books at once.
Yeah, we had a few fights, I suppose.  But last night we put a lot of that to bed.  I can���t tell you what I did with my ex wife last night���. I have to sing it.  [singing] We took a shower, we were naked. We ska dap dap doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.
I love Philly!
We work the same hours as you and you just said we work a lot harder
Make a real gym.
Block, block, block!
Two years ago, Andy blamed the warehouse for a late shipment that he forgot to process. We got yelled at pretty bad. Almost lost my job, and I was mad as hell at the time. But I said 'Darryl, just wait. He's a fool. There's gonna be an opportunity. Just be patient.' [smiles]
Whoa! That person has really gotten him or herself into quite a predicament.
This may be wrong. But there's a limit to what I would do for my child.
Actually, Val, why don't you come with? I'll need the extra hands to carry them back.
Mike, you're a very brave man.  I mean, it takes courage just to
[trying not to laugh] Okay.
Every day I have a blueberry muffin. Today, I did not have a blueberry muffin. Should have had the blueberry muffin... especially considering how incredibly superstitious I am.
I was rushing to fill an order.  I put the ladder up to grab a box of three hole from the top shelf.  Next thing I know, I'm on the ground and the ladder's on top of me.
My daughter.
The guy who was in here earlier, interviewed after me, how'd he do?
Yeah, I'll say something. I think we should be acknowledging our boss, because none of us would be here without him. Robert California! [everyone toasts]
I been selling here for five years. This is my spot.
[Michael and Holly cautiously pass each other] There's another dolly in the truck, Mike. You could take more than that lamp.
You're such a great friend, dot dot dot dot dot.'
What? All right!
You ready for tonight? We gonna tear up the town?
Oh, what's up, Roy?
Don't just take the first job that comes your way. Cause next thing you know, it's ten years later and you���re still there. Could write your obituary tomorrow, it's not gonna change.
Union! Union, yeah.
No... yes, yes. Why wouldn't I... wanna pretend to be gay? Got no problem with that.
You didn't feel like he was hiding something?
Yeah!  Da  na na na na.
I couldn't do it. I--- I ain't that strong.  And I ain't that brave.
Mike claims, we're all a family isn't that right?
Yeah, and then he starts tickling you. You know, pretty soon you're laughing and hugging. Before you know it, you've forgotten the whole thing. Ya'll can just go to church together... get an ice cream cone.
Would you just fire me, man?
Rosebud?
Man, hook you up.
Like what?
No, it's my plumber. Says so in his bio. Apparently the director discovered him doing karaoke. It's his first play. He didn't even audition.
And I���d only get to see Jada on the weekends. You know, I���m��� I���m not so sure I���d like living in Philadelphia.
Let me tell you something, Oscar. All right, Matt's an okay dude, but he's a dummy. You guys got nothing in common.
No man, we are.
Like a joke? A knock-knock joke?
Looking good, RC!
No.
Figured I look presentable. [looks Michael over] You? [Michael dressed casually in jeans and sneakers] Went a different way.
Look, would ya... look.
Yeah.
Well, when they merged the two branches together, they put
She did?
This is gonna make him feel better.
Phyllis. This rain... does it make you wanna be doing something?
I've seen this, that's not you.
They have fast food in Philly.
A book about oceans.
Who knew, right?
Hey, man. Darryl.
Darryl Philbin. Then Regis, then Rege, then Roger, then Mister Rogers.
There's a grill in the warehouse I could bring.
What, you don't like the blues?
What do you say?
[on phone] Yes, there used to be a paper clip that would pop up and say 'Looks like you are writing a letter or resume. Would you like help? I believe his name was... [looks embarrassed at camera] Clippy.
No. I got some work to do. I do got big plans with this company.
What kind of chicks are you going to meet there?
Jim really doesn���t want to come?
Okay, I'm gonna need you to make this right or else we can't be right.
What's up, Mike?
Andy, this is inappropriate. People died here, man.
Don't go breaking my scale.
Processed.
Her.  Yes, 'her' is qualified to work a dangerous machine.  You are not.  Okay?
I got Source Code on the way back.
[to Toby] Huh. Hit the road, jack.
Are you with us Mike?
I find you absolutely ribbiting!
I was talking like this. [mouths words while pointing to his ear] I don't feel good about it, but he just kept calling himself a gunshot victim and it got to me.
Oh, thank you.
No.
Checkin' in with Chet. Doppler's up.
Guess I���m going upstairs.
I wanted to leave quietly. It seemed dignified. But having Kevin grind up on my front while Erin pretends to hump me from behind is a more accurate tribute to my years here. I���m gonna miss these guys.
[opening door to Deangelo's office] Hey, saw Jim come in.  We meeting?
It's ok.
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa! So you're just gonna throw away perfectly good food?
Oh, hey Val.
Take it out. Pick it up. Pick it up. Pick it up. Take it out.
Back off! I got my reasons.
Don't use his real name. George Howard Scubb. It's a devil name.
Hmm. Yeah right
Hunger for hamburger.
Yeah.
It's Dallas the game, we can figure it out.
Yes, this is the one.
You made a bad call. And I fixed it. So I'm not apologizing.
Come down, okay?
Getting my sweat on.
Since Andy promoted me to assistant regional manager, I've been trying to step my game up, you know, be more productive. In fact, you know what? Let���s knock out a few more of these sound bites while we're here. [pauses] Whoa! That person has really gotten him or herself into quite a predicament.
I've never been lucky. And I'm not talkin' about the lottery, I'm talkin' 'bout stuff like developing a soy allergy at thirty-five. Who gets a soy allergy at thirty-five? And why is soy in everything?
Presbyterian.
You know what, you're one bad text away from getting blocked.
Andy Bernard can't squirt water in his eye and act like it doesn't freak him out. But you know who can? Older Male Lab Assistant Number One.
Good times.
Not really.
Look, I'm not down there anymore, so if the guys start making fun of you, you just, you gotta stand up for yourself.
Newsies.
We���re in play, baby.
Hey, hey, hey. I���ll do one thing with y���all.
Oh, I never sing with soul.
I just did, like, 35 minutes on the treadmill.
[clears throat] Notice anything different about me?
[to Kevin] What's a skinny guy like Toby know about cookies? You can't trust him to understand the wants and needs of the thick man. Maybe Toby from two years ago.
To look good for Val!
It's like Driving Miss Daisy, you know?
No, you don't. You don't feel us. How can you? You know what?
[on phone] This is Darryl.
Oh, I'm sorry Mike, some of my folks got to hear about this one.  [texting on cell phone] Ah. [laughs]
Show business is cold. Let���s say you get a job, which you probably won���t. They���re not gonna cut you any slack. You���re meant for a job with lots and lots of slack.
Usually that life is short and tragic. That's okay, right?
He���s been sailing for two days.
Hey!
I'll be your croak monsieur.
If I were Val, I would break up with Brandon. Then I would date the hell out of me. I wouldn't give in to me too fast, let me buy myself some nice dinners and such. But when I finally did give in, I would go crazy on myself.
[on cell phone] Fourteen years.  Fourteen.  I know.  [laughing]  Ok, alright.  I gotta go.  Later.  [hangs up]
Yeah they kind of had a specific sound that didn't really fit in with our thing.
Yeah, just weekends for now, but pretty soon, I���m switching over.
You guys lost four pounds.
No, no, Jim. This is different. This is everything.
[whispering] They're a bunch of jackals.
Nice.
That's fascinating. Tell me, what's the significance of the peach orchard, thought?
That happens a lot?
Yeah.
She's got a boyfriend.
OK, everybody smile. Ho! You lost 31 pounds.
Do it!
Everyday when I came into work, all I wanted to do was leave. So why in the world does it feel so hard to leave right now?
Hey, what���s up?
Andy, sing us another song.
I don't understand the point of a hat.
That's regular text talk.
Things? People?
Well, it's simple Mike. I mean we merged these two branches right?  So now we're shipping twice as many orders as we used to.  With Roy gone we got a smaller crew.  And I'm pickin' up all of his slack, so I think I should be compensated fairly, by gettin' a raise.
Mmm. [they clink cups]
No! No no no no no!  I said
Me and Val were going nowhere and if I'm gonna be working in Philly, I'm gonna need my freedom. So, I convinced Val to breakup with me. Here's how you do it. You say, 'What are you gonna do, breakup with me?' Like it's a joke, and then you gain a lot of weight.
No.
[claps] That was great man. Alright, I'm out of here.
She thought I was McNabb. [laughing]
19, serving 4. [serves and scores]
Uh, no.
$30.00
Hey Mike.
[Looking at Jim confused] That's great.
You want to dance?
What's rap?
You gotta stop texting me so much.
[sighs] Dinkin' flicka.
It's all about finding ways to make yourself more efficient. Life hacking, baby. This morning, I brushed my teeth in the shower. Saved my self 90 seconds. Which I just used to explain this to you. Damn it!
Oh, it's nice, it's real nice. People get dressed up.
What?
Ed Truck hired me. Jo promoted me. Gabe listened to me. All you've ever done is say no to me. I have ambition. And you kept me at the same level for years.
[singing in different tune] Out of paper, out of stock, there's friendly faces around the block, break loose from the chains that are causing your pain. Call Michael, Stanley, Jim, Dwight or Creed. Call Andy and Kelly for your business paper needs. Call Dunder Mifflin.
Snap, for real?
Thank you.
Super comfortable. Like sweatpants for my head.
Mike, this is barely more than I make.  You been here ten years, dog. [laughs]
Mm hmm.
Hey man.
Yeah, totally crazy. Puts me in an insane asylum just thinking about it. I'm stranded on shutter island over here.
I'm in.
You missed a spot.
All right. Se you later...
