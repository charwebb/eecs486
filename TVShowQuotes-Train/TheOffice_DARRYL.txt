Well, when they merged the two branches together, they put
[entering Andy's office] Hey, man. Selling cookies for Jada. Want the same as last year?
Hey, Devil's Den is that way, we should check it out. That's where the snipers hid.
We livin��� like rock stars. I���m about to eat free steaks with my sports heroes in 32 different cities.
I love the desert. It's one of my favorite ecosystems.
Well, shall we make it a little interesting?
I'll come with you, show you how it's done.
2,184 pounds, for a grand total -- oh! You all gained five pounds back.
Thank you. 'Congratulations, Darryl. Let's get wasted.' 'Have fun today, big guy.' 'Aww, yeah. Party time. Whoo-whoop.'
Get your own raise.  You gotta get out there and earn, son.
Thank you. [Kevin grabs cookie and starts eating it]
Two years ago, Andy blamed the warehouse for a late shipment that he forgot to process. We got yelled at pretty bad. Almost lost my job, and I was mad as hell at the time. But I said 'Darryl, just wait. He's a fool. There's gonna be an opportunity. Just be patient.' [smiles]
Me and Val were going nowhere and if I'm gonna be working in Philly, I'm gonna need my freedom. So, I convinced Val to breakup with me. Here's how you do it. You say, 'What are you gonna do, breakup with me?' Like it's a joke, and then you gain a lot of weight.
You have one more free throw shoot. Come on.
Okay, shush it. This was a mistake. Let's go. [Darryl and Jada leave, Ryan slowly shakes his head]
A lot has changed since y'all left, okay? You're gonna have to jump through some hoops. And the new foreman is here. Now she's one of the best we've ever known, okay? So I need you to show her your upmost respect. Make sure she feels welcome and at home, okay? Can you do that?
Nope. His name is Michael. [Michael makes the da dum ksch on the drumset again]
[makes sudden sharp turn to the left, causing DVD player to fall out open window, then grins to camera]
We just have a lot of stuff down there that could be stolen.
Andy, this is inappropriate. People died here, man.
[looks to camera for several seconds] At least it's quiet.
You feel connected to this? [hold up his back brace]
Phyllis. This rain... does it make you wanna be doing something?
Yeah, Jim's going to philly tomorrow. He said he was gonna take me with him, but that was two months ago. And I haven't heard anything since. I mean, he said that, right?
[in background] You have to be alert, and calm. And always careful...
I know he loves his pick up truck.
So, the guy shows me the deck he's built. And I'm like, 'I'll call this a deck if it'll make you happy, but this is just a porch without a roof.' [laughter, Oscar looks toward door] It was ridiculous man, it was like-you could maybe get two chairs on the thing. Two lawn chairs.
I hate goodbyes, so last week, when I left Dunder Mifflin for good, I pulled the old Irish Exit. Just slipped out without making a big deal. No hard feelings. No feelings at all.
Finish the joke, Andy. What do African Americans call?
A restful location. Talk to Glen. He'll take you up in the lift.
Oh, this is a gift, for....my man Nate here.
That thing were you softly exhale on her neck.
I'll never be sorry, not for a moment of it.
Yeah, just weekends for now, but pretty soon, I���m switching over.
[Dwight and Jim enter office] Hey, hey. They're back. [Everyone greets them]
All right, fine, you know what? One o'clock.
You're gonna be missing out on some good ideas.
I have a file of applicants here. I just gotta open it, look at it, interview a bunch of guys,hire some of 'em. So I'd say we're in the early stages of the process.
Everyday when I came into work, all I wanted to do was leave. So why in the world does it feel so hard to leave right now?
This doesn't help me. I don't respond to that kind of strategy.
I'm not checkin' email till lunch. Four hour work week.
���This coupon entitles you to one free tickle monster attack���
I'm sure they don't regret having their child, let's move it to the pros.
A lot... of things.  Uh, you, uh... What about Jan?  Lovely, lovely, lovely Jan, man.  It's goin' good, right?
Hey, I think this guy playing Sweeney Todd is my plumber.
You crushed our spirits, Gabe. Congrats. You're a big man, huh? Take a lot to destroy the creativity of a whole group of people. [notification tone] [laughter]
I didn't hire anyone if that's why you're here.
Take it out. Pick it up. Pick it up. Pick it up. Take it out.
Yeah, totally crazy. Puts me in an insane asylum just thinking about it. I'm stranded on shutter island over here.
Oh, yeah, I taught him a handshake, too.
He's not my hire, but I know who he is.
Oh, yeah, I need McMahon, Deion Branch to have big games or else I'm done.
What? Wait, wait, wait? So what? This happening?
Yeah, I taught Mike some new phrases.  I want him to get the raise, I... just can't help myself.
[chuckles in agreement] Huh ha! That's cool, man.
[to Val] You know, I don't think I've ever been in this exact angle before. I was scared at first, but I like it.
Are you wearin' lady clothes?  Those look like lady... pants.
Mike, why do you have to control how he perceives it in his mind?
Yes, thanks to you, who promoted me, after we, uh, interfaced.
Actually, Andy, you promised me five minutes to talk about productivity suggestions���
I am serious, Mike.  That's a 10% raise.  That's what I want.
Once you read the packet, sign the back.
Yeah, I'm gonna ask questions and I might not do what you say.
[Andy walks in Darryl's office] We should schedule meetings, because the days can slip away with chit-chat. Are you crying?
[enters the office with his daughter, who runs in and hugs Jim] Jada, no, no, no, Jada, what are you doing? [Jim looks knowingly at the camera] Oh. So sorry, guys. I hope my family didn't disrupt your meeting.
Why don't we make it more interesting? Loser buys dinner at Farley's.
There were times on the two and a half hour drive when I experienced doubt. That's the thing about long drives, you know, you're always going to- this is a gay bar.
No, we got a truck going out at 1:15. So, that's the busy time.
Hey, just so you know, me and you��� I don't think that's ridiculous��� Dot, dot, dot��� dot, dot.
Michael, you know you don't have to turn us all in. All you need is one scapegoat.
I don't know, man. Y'all quit with a lot of confidence. I mean, it was like, y'all came up in here dancing and everybody was- [sees Val] ooh, hold on a second. [sees Brandon] Oh.
Mike, I'm very busy down here. [eats chicken]
You mean what did we do the last time the warehouse won the lottery?
Nice. Do the damn thing. - Pow! [they fist bump and explode]
Sucks. Anyway, I just don't see it. The Knicks are tough.The Nets are tough.
Hey!  How about instead of yelling at our sweet little Miss Kapoor over five hundred sheets of paper you get back to your desk.  Start sellin' multiple reams like a man.
Actually, Val, why don't you come with? I'll need the extra hands to carry them back.
OK, um, I like Erin's hair. It's a very pretty color.
The winner: under 'Special Skills,' Mr. Don Feiner put 'Juggling.' [laughter]
So it really bothers me when somebody comes in here speeding around on a lift, playing with it like a toy. It kind of gets under my skin.
All right, I'm being a jerk. You got me this job. I should be grateful. I am, I just... you know, I get finicky about my stuff. That's all.
Shhh. If we don't listen to the overture, we won't recognize the musical themes when they come back later.
Follow me, I got a space. After you.  I���ve been thinking about you all mornin���.  I don���t know what you did, I can barely walk today.
Hey. While I got you on the phone, your husband's like a sloppy, homeless hobo. Can you fix that?
Wade said we could do the whole country in three months.
Jim is happy here, selling paper at Dunder Mifflin?
So I���m like a three year old girl in this scenario���
You're on your own, Mike. [gets up and starts to walk away]
If I were Val, I would break up with Brandon. Then I would date the hell out of me. I wouldn't give in to me too fast, let me buy myself some nice dinners and such. But when I finally did give in, I would go crazy on myself.
That stuff can come back to get you. It���s called karma. You do not want to be messing around. I got an uncle���
There's a grill in the warehouse I could bring.
Oh, it's nice, it's real nice. People get dressed up.
Hey, look, Pennsylvania license plate! That's crazy! All the way out here! Who can name all the states?
Man, see... That's what I've been sayin', man. We need to do this finally.
Why don���t you come along and tell him yourself?
You come to my house, bust up my trash cans, call my baby sister an ass****, and told her to eat dog food.
Two thousand one hundred seventy-five. [everyone moans] Sorry guys.
Look, I heard about the office. Tough break.
Hold up, I'm looking at my spit with a microscope.
Alright. I mean, it's what you want, so...
Kill their fish, and they still hire me. That���s how you do that, baby. It���s all good, I���m ready. Y���all ready for this? [sings intro to ���Everybody dance now���, points to Pam to sing first line]
[to Kevin] What's a skinny guy like Toby know about cookies? You can't trust him to understand the wants and needs of the thick man. Maybe Toby from two years ago.
When I worked in the warehouse, I was part of that lotto pool. They won ��� playing my birthday.
Hey. Hey, look, when you get done with your... [looks inside conference room] meeting, you should, uh, come to the break room. We're having a party.
Yeah them, and the Latin Kings... the Warriors...
Because you're not a daddy, and it's not your baby.
Nothing stupid about working for yourself. Hanging out with pro athletes, getting free tickets to the games. That���s why I���m doing it.
This seems like the kind of thing white people with dreadlocks do.
Oh, come on, man. I thought you had something real.
Her.  Yes, 'her' is qualified to work a dangerous machine.  You are not.  Okay?
Well, [points at Michael] those are some awful tight pants you have on. Where'd you get em? Like Queers R Us?
Higher. [motions with hand to go up more]
No. I got some work to do. I do got big plans with this company.
You ready for tonight? We gonna tear up the town?
Let me... [Jim shows him the resume again, Darryl looks at it a little longer this time] Oh. Cool. [Jim gives Darryl a thumbs-up, then looks at the camera as Darryl gets up to leave]
Come on! Just show me the Power Point.
No, no, I���m not here actually. These donuts are part of my escape from the guys at the warehouse I didn���t say goodbye to.
You're right, it's better than you! It's us! [sings] Dunder Mifflin.
She said her name was Brandon, I think. Your mom's name is Brandon?
[in a feminine voice] Hi. This is Alex.
[scores] Here we go. Here we go. Here we go.
It's more than necessary, Mike. We need this. Roy? You still have that card from the Dockworker's Union?
That's when somebody really gets in your face, you know, you just... start tickling them.
No... yes, yes. Why wouldn't I... wanna pretend to be gay? Got no problem with that.
Well you lost zero pounds. [everyone grumbles]  No change.  On the bright side you gained zero pounds.
Well you should definitely come. The foreman always comes. Plus it's fun, you know cookies, smoked fish, alcohol, people acting stupid.
[softly] Pieces of paper. [Jo rolls her eyes]
Pepper's been getting me out of the house, going on runs.
You just threw a milkshake in a restaurant where they make minimum wage.
This may be wrong. But there's a limit to what I would do for my child.
There is no occasion for you to go near this stuff, okay?
How would you like it if we booed you?
I like the sound of that. Is Kevin in?
You hired your actor friend to come here as a cop?
I don't wanna prank anymore. Things get real. It's not funny. I'm just gonna be good, stay in my room, go to church, try to do one nice thing per day. I do not wanna prank anymore.
[playing video game with Jim] Oh. Come on!
So, uh... here you go. [gives resume to Jim]
You've got a booger bubble going on there.
I'm telling you how to do this man.
Baby, if you���re watching this, you're not chubby, you're beautiful. Daddy's just got to sell some cookies. And we're also gonna exercise more. It's gonna be fun.
Well, it's simple Mike. I mean we merged these two branches right?  So now we're shipping twice as many orders as we used to.  With Roy gone we got a smaller crew.  And I'm pickin' up all of his slack, so I think I should be compensated fairly, by gettin' a raise.
You just made a good idea, a great idea.
I'll do it better than you. I earned it. I deserve it. I got passed over, God knows why, reasons I cannot and will not understand. The job was mine Andy, everyone said it was mine. Make me manager or fire me.
You log in sales at ten different times. If you log ���em all at once, you save a lot of time. It's called batching.
[reading text] Megan Fox. Question mark. What's that mean?
I have my daughter tonight; we're renting Charlotte's Web.
My summer, I, um, blew out my knee playing softball. Ended up watching CNN most of the time. I don't know how we're going to get out of Afghanistan. I hate the new assistant. He's only been here for a week, and I hate him.
I meant dressed up compared to normal. You usually dress like a ghost-buster.
How many people a year do you think get their arms cut off in a baler?
I just don't get it, Pam. I mean, you're a rational person.
I don't understand the point of a hat.
This is the spookiest warehouse in the world, kids. You don't believe me? Just take a look. [Kevin chops into Erin, who is dressed as Princess Fiona] Oh. Scary, huh? This is a surgery with an octopus and a burn victim.
That's sweet Mike. Let's see here. There's a chapter, called Gum. With one sentence. Everybody likes the guy who offers him a stick of gum.
[noticing all the warehouse workers wearing homemade beanies] Wow. It's like the nation of Islam down here.
Yeah, but then they moved the panel to the same weekend and the Doc crew paid to fly us in. It was kismet.
Lightbulb's burnt out, so it's dark. And the heat from the backup generator keeps it nice and warm. Sometimes I think about it when I'm trying to fall asleep at home. But as far as the rest of the office goes, it doesn't exist, okay?
Yeah, I'll say something. I think we should be acknowledging our boss, because none of us would be here without him. Robert California! [everyone toasts]
You feel connected to his baby over there?
Mike, you can't do that. It's conflict of interest.
Sometimes it seems like it was better down in the warehouse, you know?
Look, I'm not down there anymore, so if the guys start making fun of you, you just, you gotta stand up for yourself.
[puts newspaper down] Wow. That dude is good.
Oh, it works. Him and me, all right, we are crazy in love. More love than your small mind can comprehend. And we have two disposable incomes. And no kids. And we're taking our business elsewhere. [Oscar and Darryl exit holding hands]
Yeah, but I never said you had nothing to live for.
Mmm-hmm. [thumping] [Roy groaning] Now you've got to drink.
Yeah, yeah me too. I think it���d be like��� You know what? [grabs basketball] I think it���d be like a Kevin Durant jump shot��� Perfecto! [shoots basketball at hoop on wall, basketball misses and lands in fish tank, killing the fish] Oh my god���
Oh, no. I mean, I want to, I just...I don't want to force you into something you don't want to do.
[reads text] Come to parking lot. Crazy pigeon action?
Look, just be straight with me, man. You can be gay with Matt, just be straight with me.
[driving truck] Hey, y'all are not gonna be playing these little private games all the way.
And I'm telling them you guys sexually harassed my sister.
Uh... I have other issues. I'm terrible at math. Overweight. You- you're in great shape. A lot better shape than I am, tell you what.
I have no idea what his problem is, that's just my standard advice. It's good advice right?
Hey, come here. You guys need to see this.
Delivered all my furniture to Philly. Hey, keep it down, though. Nobody knows I���m here.
Hey, Mike, look. How bout we go upstairs, too. You know learn how the office works. We can all switch places today.
What? Must���ve been another devilishly handsome debonair individual.
Since Andy promoted me to assistant regional manager, I've been trying to step my game up, you know, be more productive. In fact, you know what? Let���s knock out a few more of these sound bites while we're here. [pauses] Whoa! That person has really gotten him or herself into quite a predicament.
I just think you���re going into this a little fast.
We're the ones that got to clean that up!
No, that's uh. Porn. Pornography. Old lady... nasty... porn.
How about the sales department is the sails?
I don't know who's got you upset but my advice is stop crying.
If we were living in Sweden, I wouldn't have to worry about this 'cause we'd have universal healthcare.
So you sure you remembered everything for your trip?
My resolution is to read more. And if someone else is driving me to the bookstore, I can eat my PB&J in the car. 2011 is coming up all Darryl.
You say we're the same, but we get compensated very differently.
Man, we can see all your business coming around the corner, okay? You need to, you know, hide the... good thing you don't have a lot of business to start with.
Nobody told me what people were, alright? So...  label yourselves or take what you get.
I love it. And it���s Athleap now. And the city is amazing.
2,336 pounds. Y'all need to learn some portion control.
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa! So you're just gonna throw away perfectly good food?
Everybody knows I go to Philly. I've just been using sick days I saved up. But, Erin was so excited about being sneaky-sneaks, I went along with it.
We are hanging out-right now. You want some more of this?
Nope. I'm good. I'm here. Let's find some warehouse workers.
Glen, could you excuse us? [Andy slams the door after Glen leaves, panting heavily]
Come on, Dwight, stop overreacting. I���m getting all my work done here. No customers have complained. Nobody even knows.
It does not say dangerous. And there's no exclamation point.
Somebody just needs to get her attention, tell her it's not OK to do this in public.
[taking photo with Jada] Let's see that smile. Go on. [waves to Val]
Yeah sorry, I'm just looking for a pen.
He gets condescending when he's nervous. Or when he's excited or sleepy. Not an easy person to be friends with.
I asked for a list. [Dwight rides in on a tricycle, laughing diabolically] ...and a clown.
Don't just take the first job that comes your way. Cause next thing you know, it's ten years later and you���re still there. Could write your obituary tomorrow, it's not gonna change.
But you want me to put it back in the truck.
Then you gotta have muscles, man. You got some muscles? Let's see.
You know what? It's your first time, let's split the office. You can have sales, the annex, Creed, and I don't know I'll just take, uh, accounting.
Man, you can't do that stuff. You'll only find pain. When my ex-wife got into my e-mail account, she was devastated.
Then I guess I figured out where I stand. This is a love beanie.
Yes. All of 'em. Together. It's a conspiracy. Listen to me, Mike, you gotta do something about them.
It's not real... until your wife is on board.
No, it's my plumber. Says so in his bio. Apparently the director discovered him doing karaoke. It's his first play. He didn't even audition.
I just did, like, 35 minutes on the treadmill.
What? Is he retiring? You getting him a gift or something?
Yes! [to video screen]  Right here. You are a naughty girl!
I was talking like this. [mouths words while pointing to his ear] I don't feel good about it, but he just kept calling himself a gunshot victim and it got to me.
Yeah, I did. I, I was talking to this girl at a bar.
One of 'em, Glenn, is starting one of those fat camps where he steals your kid in the middle of the night. Madge and a couple other guys might start a strip club, but on a boat. And Heday is investing in an energy drink for Asian homosexuals. [Andy laughs awkwardly]
You need to change your standard for what's worthy of a text. Ask yourself is this something Darryl needs to know. The answers almost always no.
You didn't feel like he was hiding something?
I���ve been meaning to join a gym. [narrating over a montage of scenes with him and Val] For my health. I used to say I wanted to live long enough to see a black President. I didn���t realize how easy that would be. So now I want to live long enough to see a really, really gay President. Or a supermodel President. I want to see all the different kinds of Presidents.
Okay, bring it home now.  And don't forget the new black man phrase I taught you.
Hey, I like you.  Oh yeah, what's not to like?  But you need to access your uncrazy side, otherwise maybe this thing's run its course.
That's big of you, man. Takes a lot of courage.
[To himself] Back for more, huh? [Gets up and walks towards Jim]
I saw a TLC show on Kate Walsh's home office. All corkboard.
You know what, you're one bad text away from getting blocked.
[Talks drunk angry] Jim, that guy. [Scoffs] You gotta stick to your word! Like when you say something to a buddy, a real buddy...what are you gonna do, lie? To your buddy? [Sighs] It's awful.
You're not as scary as Book Face, over there.
[as Jim empties thermos into trash] Nah, nah, nah. You don't have to do that.
Yes, as a matter of fact, I uh��� [pulls booklets from his bag] I wrote some down. There you go. [passes out booklets] Wow, this guy came prepared, it impresses me! [group laughs]
Hang on little ladies. You don't need this thing, I'll go grab my synthesizer. [Everyone cheers]
Think about it! What other mammal, besides humans, drinks the milk of another mammal? I mean, you don't see a bear drinking raccoon milk.
Would it be more hilarious than Angela having a Chinese baby?
I was rushing to fill an order.  I put the ladder up to grab a box of three hole from the top shelf.  Next thing I know, I'm on the ground and the ladder's on top of me.
Mike, this is barely more than I make.  You been here ten years, dog. [laughs]
[Dwight heads toward a strip club] Oh, no, no, no. Uh-uh.
It's not just today, it's everyday. It seems like the better title I have, the stupider my job gets.
You know what you guys should do? Go to the bookstore at lunch. There's tons of cuties and it's easy to talk to them. 'Hey, what book is that? Cool, let's hang out tonight. Sex already? Whoa...'
Wow. Man. I hope he doesn���t regret it.
[on phone]It���s Darryl. Erin told me to pretend to be a cop and say your mom died.
Mike. Get off of the lift. Please. Come on now.
I think she could... sense my sadness, and I, and I found out too late that she... she's the copy editor at the Trib.
Let me put my shoes on. [hangs up phone, dial tone]
[Michael and Holly cautiously pass each other] There's another dolly in the truck, Mike. You could take more than that lamp.
Here is an old man and a goth dude... and then the old crone from Drag Me to Hell.
Oh my God, I think I see the imprint of a ring pop.
Why would you think a lady is me?
Figured I look presentable. [looks Michael over] You? [Michael dressed casually in jeans and sneakers] Went a different way.
I don't have a plan exactly. More of a loose structure. Gives me freedom to improvise. It's like jazz. [scatting] Andy don't mess with me. [continues scatting] I'll figure something out.
I had no idea. This plumber has pipes!
Look, I need this. Ok? Your daughter is a pretty little girl. Let her go door-to-door. You think people gonna buy cookies from my [hesitates] chubby daughter?
Here's what I'm gonna do, I'm calling corporate and I'm filing a complaint against both of you.
Some freaky stuff going on. I was walking behind Gabe and I heard some things.
I've been working out. But, the problem is, I've been building muscle underneath. And that top layer hasn't burned off yet. Awkward stage.
And did your brains tell you to ruin these boxes with grease?
One more, yeah. [Again motions to go even higher]
Don't use his real name. George Howard Scubb. It's a devil name.
Every day I have a blueberry muffin. Today, I did not have a blueberry muffin. Should have had the blueberry muffin... especially considering how incredibly superstitious I am.
Darryl Philbin. Then Regis, then Rege, then Roger, then Mister Rogers.
Nah man, we get along now.  Real well.
You made a bad call. And I fixed it. So I'm not apologizing.
[plays soft chords and sings]  Couldn't get outta bed today. Wish the alarm clock would go away.
There was a time when the only people who texted you were people you wanted to text you. Girls. And they'd all say the same thing. 'I'm coming over baby.' And I would text back 'BTB', bring that booty.
Jim was nice enough to give me his bedroom.
Yeah, we had a few fights, I suppose.  But last night we put a lot of that to bed.  I can���t tell you what I did with my ex wife last night���. I have to sing it.  [singing] We took a shower, we were naked. We ska dap dap doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.
Hey, hey, hey. I���ll do one thing with y���all.
It's all about finding ways to make yourself more efficient. Life hacking, baby. This morning, I brushed my teeth in the shower. Saved my self 90 seconds. Which I just used to explain this to you. Damn it!
It's dangerous, Michael. Come on, get off this.
Andy Bernard can't squirt water in his eye and act like it doesn't freak him out. But you know who can? Older Male Lab Assistant Number One.
I'm done. I gotta get out of here.
Um no. This is not a gym. This is like a scene out of Saw 5.
No, no, no, no. It's not worth it.
You got it. Pick it up. Take it out.
So if I started singing ���Down By the Old Mill Stream���, you couldn't join me in a three part harmony. [Andy and Officer Foley shake their heads no, Darryl begins singing] Down by the, down by the, down by the....
Actually, that was the sound of me eating spaghetti. But I���m gonna let them think the other thing.
And we all know, baseball does not last forever.
Oh you could stay too.  He's got a big place.
Hey, you know what would be fun? Like, sleeping.
I was still thinking of going back to school.
I don't know... I thought I was enough family for my daughter.
It's not safe, you don't have a license.
Aw, come on. What's the harm? [makes face] Mmm. What flavor was that?
That's when you hit me with what's getting you down, okay?
[to Val] Hey, you caught some of that?
We work the same hours as you and you just said we work a lot harder
I hope so. Think about this carefully. There's better lives than this one.
I told you we're way past rules. We have been for some time now. We start having rules now, everything we built collapses.
I like the sound of this. [looks at Dwight] Maybe one day I'll be sitting in Michael's chair. Wouldn't that be something?
Oh yeah, and um there's a Christmas party upstairs tonight, wanted to tell you about.
Looked like it. Sometimes when I'm down like this, it helps to sing the blues.
Say stuff like, 'Good morning, Good Afternoon'. People appreciate that.
My biggest fear is that someone will distract us from getting all the shipments out on time.
My future's not gonna be determined by seven little white lotto balls. It's gonna be determined by two big black balls. I control my destiny. I do.
Yeah, I heard. It sounds kinda lame. [to camera] No offense. You going, Toby?
I'll answer that, Jim. I would use it as an opportunity to teach, uh, about actions... and consequences... of actions. [Jim and Gabe stare at Darryl]
I got my whole life to be a minority executive. I only have about a year left in these knees, though.
Hey I'm not gonna tell you this stuff if you gonna throw it back in my face.
A car parked in the sun is like a toaster oven.
These are very dangerous machines down here, and the upstairs workers,
That doesn't mean anything. [to Kevin] Kevin, do you want to buy cookies from me?
That's fascinating. Tell me, what's the significance of the peach orchard, thought?
What happens when we're done chewing? Do we spit it out on the floor, or keep it in our mouths the rest of the time?
Hey Val. Want a beer? It might taste better than that pool water you've been drinking.
Ohh. Ok. I didn't realize we were doing trick questions. What's the safest way to go skiing? Don't ski! [office laughs]
And I fell and busted my ankle.  I'm legitimately scared for my workers.
Hey, y'all wanna hear some loud music or something?
Hey, man, you put together a pretty fun night for everybody. I saw you talking to Hide. Did you hear that dude's life story? It's amazing, right?
Dwight, look, I���m sorry you���re having a hard time with this, okay? Athlead is my future. No disrespect to Dunder Mifflin, but if I can have fun at work, I want that.
Mike, this is the opposite of safety.  You jump, you're gonna serious hurt yourself.
And I'm gonna play this here share the wealth card.
The man is paying me to take Chinese.  I will say what I need to say, and soon, I will say it in Chinese.
Nothing. [pulls out a can of soda] It's mine. [Jim shakes his head] [after looking through DVR] What happened to my Tavis Smileys?
Mike, we're not shipping as much as we did last year.
Maybe I'll stay overnight.  Got a cousin lives down there.
You're new to the game. You learned a lesson today. See you next year, sport.
Whoa, I work at a paper company, those things terrify me. They could put us out of business, you know? I heard those machines hold like, ten books at once.
[interrupting] Stop talking 'bout it. I said I'm fine with it.
[as Cookie Monster] Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum.
Mike gave me a list of his top ten Springsteen songs. Three of them were Huey Lewis and the News. One was Tracy Chapman, Fast Car. And my personal favorite, Short People.
So this is cool. I think we make a good fit. [stands up]
[bluesy] Da na na na na...  da na na na  na...
Actually, Andy, we call this one Dwight, Jr.
When I was a kid, my grandmother used to make me chocolate cake when I wasn't feeling good. She's not around to do that anymore. I'm sorry, I just need a moment to myself just to clear my head.
Yeah, when are they gonna do a Labradoodle that's just Lab?
We did it! Hey, and look, the buyers wanna make sure it���s not just a Philly play, so get this: they���re gonna pay for us to go pitch out west. We talking Spurs, the Jazz, Cowboys. Blake Griffin, baby.
Uh... [looks at camera] yes?! I was. [sits back down] Little joke!
Yes. I do remember saying something like that to you.
[on cell phone] Fourteen years.  Fourteen.  I know.  [laughing]  Ok, alright.  I gotta go.  Later.  [hangs up]
Look, Andy, even if your ancestors did own slaves, it wouldn't be your fault. This is only weird if you make it weird.
You don���t have to say it if you���re doing it.
Andy made me his consigliere. Which means Assistant Regional Manager. I guess he thought I'd be into The Godfather 'cause I'm black. Wrong! I'm into The Godfather 'cause I'm a cinephile. I like Scarface 'cause I'm black.
It was kind of mumbled, I don't know, uh, only thing I could make out clearly was 'Andy,' 'Problem,' 'Eliminate,' something. I don't know what it meant.
Back at the bus.  We were locked out.  Phyllis is sitting on the ground eating a dirty sandwich.
Take it all the way up to your lip, yeah.
You're such a great friend, dot dot dot dot dot.'
I brought those in. It's my birthday.  That's some stone-cold narcissism right there.
Okay, I'll start.  It's pretty simple really. I uh, I think I deserve a raise.  I'm scheduled to get one in six months, but I'd like that to be moved up to now.
Your friends are like Spider-man, if he had gotten bitten by a spider and then got really into masturbating.
I'm just glad we're gonna try it out.
No, you don't. You don't feel us. How can you? You know what?
No. Thank you for your interest in my truck.
Alright, we're going down to my warehouse, that means we're playing by my rules. No messing with the baler and be cool in front of me and Val. We just broke up.
Just a hunch. Your gift is on the way.
Well, I'm sorry if it seems that way to you.
Val knit me a beanie. But I can't if it's a ���we're just friends��� beanie or a ���I'm hot, you're hot, let's get it poppin'��� beanie. So I'm gonna up the ante, give her a clearly romantic gift, and we'll get to the meaning of the beanie.
All right man, don't cry.  It's cool.  I'll let you get it for $400.
One second, one second, one second. [stops playing] So, this song is from the point of view of a little girl?
Ok, so um, what's his name? All the way in the back there.
That's 'cause of you, Mike.  They're not gonna give the workin' man more than the boss.
I'm gonna tell Jim to go [Bleep] himself.
It���s 30 degrees out. You drinkin��� a mildshake?
Hey... [sighs] You know what, I could use a breath of fresh air. Let's do it.
I would if I owned it and I went broke.
Yeah, and then he starts tickling you. You know, pretty soon you're laughing and hugging. Before you know it, you've forgotten the whole thing. Ya'll can just go to church together... get an ice cream cone.
I can���t really picture it. Can you... get it on there. Yeah. And maybe, get the cheeks.
The guys did invite me out to celebrate but I decided to just stay home. Eat a bunch of tacos in my basement.
Her mom wants me to take her to mass. I guess that's something to do.
Which usually means there's clothes all over the living room.
You should talk in a higher voice 'cause the camera makes you sound weird.
Well, yeah, what can I say, a player���s gotta play.
It's Dallas the game, we can figure it out.
Ahh���We don't really do those. We just sign the thing.
[approaches Kevin] Would you like to buy some cookies?
[Falls backwards onto the food table] Oh! Whoa!
I didn't have time because of my daughter.
What you say, bitch? You know, you might be right.
Hey, man. How are you doing? I, um���I didn���t call ���cause I figured you changed the number.
Actually, Bob Vance bought out the warehouse. So he's keeping on the whole crew. So, we good.
And I���d only get to see Jada on the weekends. You know, I���m��� I���m not so sure I���d like living in Philadelphia.
I need you to sign these, we got a shipment going out.
Guys, guys. That���s so vague. You gotta do the zip plus four. 1-8-5-0-5 dash 7-4-2-7.
It's not a trash compactor!  It's a baler!
[On phone] Hello?....Justine! [laughs] Nice surprise! How you doin' baby?....Nah. No no, I didn't win. When I got promoted I stop-...what?...Yeah. Yeah, Glenn won....Oh, you wanna call him? Yeah, you should call him, congratulate him. That'll be-...What?....Oh, his number's in your old phone. Oh, you know what? I might have it right- [hangs up] Whoops.
That sounds fun, mucking around in the dump. Wish I could go.
Check out this song I wrote: I'ma love you downstairs tonight... [overlapping chatter]
Didn't have to see. It was sales. I can feel it. They are out of control.
Dude, I'm gonna be here all week, right? Five days a week, I figure I'll start slow.
I know Citizen Kane. Rosebud didn't explain why he was how he was, it just represented what was important to him as a child, that he missed.
What kind of chicks are you going to meet there?
Spot a cow, last person to say 'Jackson Five' has to get on its back and ride it.
I couldn't do it. I--- I ain't that strong.  And I ain't that brave.
Yeah. Just put me out of my misery.
It's getting late. I thought you guys could use a little [sets up laptop] inspiration.
You mean to tell me no one wanted an energy drink for Asian homosexuals?
You know, I just got Limitless on my iPad. I bet I could get it on the TV.
No, he doesn't. [to Michael] I told her Santa would be here.
Yeah they kind of had a specific sound that didn't really fit in with our thing.
Yeah, ok so what, you buy 40 boxes?
You know this would not happen if we had a union.
[on the phone] I just, no, she be talking to your mom or something. This is my daughter too, Justine! You seem to think, [Justine hangs up] oh... pick a damn tree already.
Show business is cold. Let���s say you get a job, which you probably won���t. They���re not gonna cut you any slack. You���re meant for a job with lots and lots of slack.
Come on man. I'm being serious. Don't joke.
That's what I've been trying to tell you, Mike.  It's serious down there.  We do dangerous stuff, man.  This is shenanigans, foolishness, Nerf-ball.  You live a sweet, little, Nerf-y life.  Sittin' on your biscuit.  Never havin' to risk it.
No! No no no no no!  I said
Better get some decent speakers up here then, cause we���re gonna do this right.
It's like she only wants to hook up when Ryan comes around.  It's gotten to the point where I get excited every time I see that little dude walk through the door.
[leaving someone a message on his cell phone, looking very uncomfortable] Hey what's up, I just thought I'd try you. I was thinking about that story where you ran into the girl you used to babysit.
Local musician? Local legend! I used to come hear you play every week at the Deerhead.
Andy, when I was twelve years old, we did a field trip, a lock-in at the zoo. I met this girl, I thought she was so perfect. I was in love with her. But when the sun came up, I knew it wasn't real, 'cause she was ugly and I had grown tired of her. I know you want reception today, but tomorrow you won't want to do her. She's a dog.
Everyone, we have a voluntary meeting in the conference room to discuss Erin's confidence.
Andy, it���s Darryl. Take your drawers off your head.
I don't know. You gonna wash it? Or you gonna let it soak?
Hey, why don't you and me play those?
[in the bathroom with Robert[ Yeah, I guess sometimes I have nightmares about being buried alive.
Yeah that's true.  You gotta call your girl, and get paid.  Show her who wears the pants in the relationship.
Yes, I am. Just so everyone's on the same page.
I put three pallets on the truck to Blue Cross once a week. They use a lot of paper.
Oh, I'm sorry Mike, some of my folks got to hear about this one.  [texting on cell phone] Ah. [laughs]
I don���t care, choose amongst yourselves. Not the van though.
Okay, can you just stand right there?  [snaps camera phone picture] I gotta send some e-mails.
Jada don't want to spend Christmas with me. She told her mom it wasn't as much fun. And how could she say that? You know, I took her to the toy store to buy her own presents.
Yes sir.  Remember that.  I'll be right outside if you need me
I put some guys on tonight. Best of your bunch and my bunch. Tell you now though, it's gonna be mostly my bunch.
Come on, stay, alright? It's good for people to get to know you.
I haven't been to New York in a long time.
Ten people, Michael. Ten people.  Would you like to be one of them?
Still good. You guys lost a pound. You lost one pound.
How far is this place? [turns off radio]
Mike, you're a very brave man.  I mean, it takes courage just to
You want to hold me, to see how you feel?
[Pam knocks on Darryl's door] Don't come in, I'm busy. [Pam opens the door]
[singing in different tune] Out of paper, out of stock, there's friendly faces around the block, break loose from the chains that are causing your pain. Call Michael, Stanley, Jim, Dwight or Creed. Call Andy and Kelly for your business paper needs. Call Dunder Mifflin.
Hey! He deserves this. And he said I could get in on it too.  [whispers] Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. For sure. For sure. for sure. Man!  And Pam's into it?
It's cool that you like the southwest. It's one of my favorite regions.
This thing could take your arm off, your head off, you know, just exercise caution.
[walking by with new carpet] What... What's that?  Whatcha doing?
If this company���s going down, I wanna go down on it. With it. I wanna go down with it.
No, wait. You're, you're supposed to... Never mind. Da  na na na na.
OK, everybody smile. Ho! You lost 31 pounds.
No, that's not as much fun. You know what?
I did. I did have a fantastic basement. Now it smells like tacos. You can't air out a basement and taco air is heavy. Settles at the lowest point.
I got too much ice cream. You want some?' 'Getting' my fry on.'
[in a dress shirt and tie] Like what?
Jim, I got my ass chewed out because one of your orders got messed up. And Andy, you said you drove him to the courthouse.
No? OK. I don't wanna be here anymore. Fire me.
I was born ready! No, I suck at interviews. I had Andy���s job in the bag until my interview.
Maybe the grinch hid the Christmas star, and we could ask for clues, and he'll tell us if we're hot or cold.
No, no, Jim. This is different. This is everything.
[exits Andy's office smiling] All I need is Kevin. Dude buys more cookies than everyone combined and then some. [Kevin waves at him] When I first started selling cookies he was a relatively thin man. Not a thin man, mind you. Relatively thin.
Man, you have got to be kidding me.
The guy who was in here earlier, interviewed after me, how'd he do?
���Mandate���- Always think of two men on a date. [awkward moment] I have gay friends��� I have one gay friend. [to Jim] Oscar?
[singing] Out of paper, out of stock, there's friendly faces around the block, break loose from the chains that are causing your pain.
Da  na na na na.  No, no, check it out, look. Da  na na na na... want to do that?
Hooray. Live it up big D. ' 'Days like this don't come often enough. Time to celebrate. You deserve this'?
Probably shouldn't tell you this, but a lotta guys in the warehouse work multiple jobs, so... we have a place.
[Jim puts popcorn bag in microwave] Hey, if you don't want to teach me Power Point, just say so.
Yeah, maybe everyone move one instrument to the right?
Seriously, that was hot. Feel like you and the newsman had a groove going.
Let me tell you something, Oscar. All right, Matt's an okay dude, but he's a dummy. You guys got nothing in common.
The baler can flatten a car engine.  It can cut off your arm and crush your entire body without skipping a beat.
We do safety training every year, or after an accident. ... We've never made it a full year.  This particular time, I was reaching for a supply box on the top shelf, when one office worker, who shall remain nameless, kicked the ladder out from under me and yelled...
I feel good today. My little girl Jada? It's my turn to have her for Christmas this year. Two years ago I had her, and we had the best time. I tivoed her favorite shows, some things I've never heard of. iCarly... You know who's funny on that show? The friend with the video camera. He's got a nice way of talking.
I been selling here for five years. This is my spot.
Tracee Ellis Ross. Daughter of the First Lady of Motown, Diana Ross.
[on phone] Yes, there used to be a paper clip that would pop up and say 'Looks like you are writing a letter or resume. Would you like help? I believe his name was... [looks embarrassed at camera] Clippy.
I taught Mike some, uh, phrases to help with his interracial conversations. You know, stuff like, 'Fleece it out.' 'Going mach five.' 'Dinkin' flicka.' You know, things us Negroes say.
Ed Truck hired me. Jo promoted me. Gabe listened to me. All you've ever done is say no to me. I have ambition. And you kept me at the same level for years.
Obviously you know how a gym works. So you know I���m not going to pay money for this. You want people to come to your gym? Make a real gym.
Let me get this straight. You lost all of it. All your winnings. A hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
If you don't enter them immediately, you forget. What?
I got Source Code on the way back.
Uh. So I guess that was your mom who called me earlier looking for the address? Real deep voiced woman?
Yeah. Yeah, it���s hot. The music is awesome. And the tacos are���for real.
I have a kid. Last week, Jim at home? That was no vacation.
I've never been lucky. And I'm not talkin' about the lottery, I'm talkin' 'bout stuff like developing a soy allergy at thirty-five. Who gets a soy allergy at thirty-five? And why is soy in everything?
Uh oh, look at this. Red plastic cup, red plastic cup. How about that?
No, that's not a good idea. I don't see that as a very good song.
Nahh! [shakes head] No. Not Justine. Never Justine.
I love Jim. I love that he hooked me up with a job. It's just, he uses old t-shirts as wash rags. He doesn't wash his dishes. Apparently, they need to [quote-unquote fingers] soak... He hooked me up with a job.
[Kevin scratches cookie order form and sniffs it] It's not a scratch-and-sniff, Kev.
Look you need to pick yourself up. Man up, alright? You will win this in the end. It's all about heart, and character. Be your best self.
Okay, I'm gonna need you to make this right or else we can't be right.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. Okay, I made the mistake of sneaking out of here and that���s on me. But I���m not gonna spend the rest of the day here doing stuff with you cause you���re feeling sentimental.
I'm telling you, don't do it. I've got nothing against strip clubs, but I do have something against them at noon on a Monday. The day shift at a strip club? You can't unsee that.
Woah-Oh! Haven���t been in one of these in forever.
Mike claims, we're all a family isn't that right?
[claps] That was great man. Alright, I'm out of here.
Damn! Jim, you got a real Facebook energy going on here man. You Zuckerberged this place out!
I wanted to leave quietly. It seemed dignified. But having Kevin grind up on my front while Erin pretends to hump me from behind is a more accurate tribute to my years here. I���m gonna miss these guys.
Come on, now, Justine, look... Listen, look, I've been planning this, okay? You cannot do this, Justine.
