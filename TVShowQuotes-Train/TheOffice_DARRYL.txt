If you loan me some money.
Would it be more hilarious than Angela having a Chinese baby?
You need to get back on top.
One more, yeah. [Again motions to go even higher]
Come on, now, Justine, look... Listen, look, I've been planning this, okay? You cannot do this, Justine.
Why don't we make it more interesting? Loser buys dinner at Farley's.
I'm telling you, don't do it. I've got nothing against strip clubs, but I do have something against them at noon on a Monday. The day shift at a strip club? You can't unsee that.
And did your brains tell you to ruin these boxes with grease?
Sure, sweetie.
[noticing Erin in the background leading a black man dressed in a suit through the office] Who's that?
If you don't mind.
Meredith's a little cute. I'm just realizing. She got, like, a Emma Stone thing.
My bad.
[Looking at Jim confused] That's great.
What have you done for me?
Alright! [high fives Pam]
Hey Mike, do my thing.
Hey, just so you know, me and you��� I don't think that's ridiculous��� Dot, dot, dot��� dot, dot.
I'll put you down for shortbreads.
Come on, stay, alright? It's good for people to get to know you.
Maybe I'll stay overnight.  Got a cousin lives down there.
Actually, Bob Vance bought out the warehouse. So he's keeping on the whole crew. So, we good.
You guys lost four pounds.
She's six.
I hope so. Think about this carefully. There's better lives than this one.
I can't--- what, Mike?  Are you---
You gotta stop texting me so much.
[speaking Spanish] Por favor, tequila seoor.
I���ll take a look.
Come on, Mike, let me borrow the hat for just a couple of hours.
Darryl Philbin. Then Regis, then Rege, then Roger, then Mister Rogers.
You're such a great friend, dot dot dot dot dot.'
What do we have here?
Da  na na na na.
You need to change your standard for what's worthy of a text. Ask yourself is this something Darryl needs to know. The answers almost always no.
Look, I'm not down there anymore, so if the guys start making fun of you, you just, you gotta stand up for yourself.
Wade said we could do the whole country in three months.
Everyone, we have a voluntary meeting in the conference room to discuss Erin's confidence.
I don't wanna prank anymore. Things get real. It's not funny. I'm just gonna be good, stay in my room, go to church, try to do one nice thing per day. I do not wanna prank anymore.
Let me put my shoes on. [hangs up phone, dial tone]
We're loading at one.
Glen, could you excuse us? [Andy slams the door after Glen leaves, panting heavily]
Sometimes it seems like it was better down in the warehouse, you know?
Nobody told me what people were, alright? So...  label yourselves or take what you get.
That was definitely not dancing.
A restful location. Talk to Glen. He'll take you up in the lift.
It's not real... until your wife is on board.
Show business is cold. Let���s say you get a job, which you probably won���t. They���re not gonna cut you any slack. You���re meant for a job with lots and lots of slack.
Hey.
Thanks, it's cool. So...
[clears throat] Notice anything different about me?
What?
Mmhmm. [points at gabe] Caramel soy latte.
No... yes, yes. Why wouldn't I... wanna pretend to be gay? Got no problem with that.
You can owe me.
Cool.
Now, this is the forklift.  You need--- [Michael rattles it] You need a license to operate this machine.  That means the upstairs office workers
[playing video game with Jim] Oh. Come on!
I love Philly!
That's okay, Mike.
We good.
There's a grill in the warehouse I could bring.
Hey. While I got you on the phone, your husband's like a sloppy, homeless hobo. Can you fix that?
Yeah, ok so what, you buy 40 boxes?
Correction: we don't care.
I have no idea what his problem is, that's just my standard advice. It's good advice right?
Oh, it's nice, it's real nice. People get dressed up.
Oh, thank you.
What's wrong with you?
Good luck to you.
How much?
[Pam knocks on Darryl's door] Don't come in, I'm busy. [Pam opens the door]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. Okay, I made the mistake of sneaking out of here and that���s on me. But I���m not gonna spend the rest of the day here doing stuff with you cause you���re feeling sentimental.
Baby, if you���re watching this, you're not chubby, you're beautiful. Daddy's just got to sell some cookies. And we're also gonna exercise more. It's gonna be fun.
You made a bad call. And I fixed it. So I'm not apologizing.
OK.
Holy [bleep], what? Let me see that. It's so light. Like a croissant.
Make it happen, cap'in.
Looks that way.
This trip was longer than I thought.
Yeah, the booth is lame without it.
It's cool really.
You're gonna be missing out on some good ideas.
There's other pencil's in this office.
You have one more free throw shoot. Come on.
Well you should definitely come. The foreman always comes. Plus it's fun, you know cookies, smoked fish, alcohol, people acting stupid.
Yeah, and then he starts tickling you. You know, pretty soon you're laughing and hugging. Before you know it, you've forgotten the whole thing. Ya'll can just go to church together... get an ice cream cone.
That's your new standard.
Are you serious?
Um no. This is not a gym. This is like a scene out of Saw 5.
Are you wearin' lady clothes?  Those look like lady... pants.
He gets condescending when he's nervous. Or when he's excited or sleepy. Not an easy person to be friends with.
Huh?
You a baby daddy?
This thing could take your arm off, your head off, you know, just exercise caution.
[to Toby] Huh. Hit the road, jack.
I am serious, Mike.  That's a 10% raise.  That's what I want.
[Michael and Holly cautiously pass each other] There's another dolly in the truck, Mike. You could take more than that lamp.
It's not a trash compactor!  It's a baler!
So you still missing Ryan?
Which me am I gonna be today?
Forget it, man.
Look, Andy, even if your ancestors did own slaves, it wouldn't be your fault. This is only weird if you make it weird.
Be quiet.
Hell yeah.  You know why?  Because that was my baby.
Oh, come on, man. I thought you had something real.
Yes sir.  Remember that.  I'll be right outside if you need me
Hey, man. How are you doing? I, um���I didn���t call ���cause I figured you changed the number.
Yeah them, and the Latin Kings... the Warriors...
[softly] Pieces of paper. [Jo rolls her eyes]
[reading text] Megan Fox. Question mark. What's that mean?
That's when you hit me with what's getting you down, okay?
There's information here? Yeah, you're right, I don't need this.
Look how happy he is.
No, I'm good. Keep them.
You know.
Cool. It should be taller though, right?
It's not a race.
That bothers me too.
Correct.
That was never agreed upon.
Mike. Get off of the lift. Please. Come on now.
You know what you guys should do? Go to the bookstore at lunch. There's tons of cuties and it's easy to talk to them. 'Hey, what book is that? Cool, let's hang out tonight. Sex already? Whoa...'
Two thousand one hundred seventy-five. [everyone moans] Sorry guys.
Mike, you're a very brave man.  I mean, it takes courage just to
Oh, in the warehouse we use code names for people we want to talk about. Andy was Jelly Roll. Mike was Dennis the Menace. Ryan was douche bag.
Hey Mike.
I'm not mad. Are you mad?
You know what? It's your first time, let's split the office. You can have sales, the annex, Creed, and I don't know I'll just take, uh, accounting.
Hiding from his momma.
Yeah, this isn't happening.
Sucks. Anyway, I just don't see it. The Knicks are tough.The Nets are tough.
Make that face he likes.
Yes, this is the one.
Yup.
No do not touch it!
Spot a cow, last person to say 'Jackson Five' has to get on its back and ride it.
Uh, no.
Mike, why do you have to control how he perceives it in his mind?
You're on your own, Mike. [gets up and starts to walk away]
I hate that too.
So, uh... here you go. [gives resume to Jim]
[entering] What are y���all doing?
She said her name was Brandon, I think. Your mom's name is Brandon?
One, two, three, hit it.
Oh, yeah, I taught him a handshake, too.
All right. Se you later...
Dwight!
Thank you.
[in background] You have to be alert, and calm. And always careful...
Who cares?
Congratulations, baby!
No.
Why don���t you come along and tell him yourself?
Okay, I'll start.  It's pretty simple really. I uh, I think I deserve a raise.  I'm scheduled to get one in six months, but I'd like that to be moved up to now.
I wasn't.
Mmm-hmm. [thumping] [Roy groaning] Now you've got to drink.
Boo! Boo!
Why is the forklift in the wall?
OK, great.
Put it on, man.
I���ve been meaning to join a gym. [narrating over a montage of scenes with him and Val] For my health. I used to say I wanted to live long enough to see a black President. I didn���t realize how easy that would be. So now I want to live long enough to see a really, really gay President. Or a supermodel President. I want to see all the different kinds of Presidents.
That stuff can come back to get you. It���s called karma. You do not want to be messing around. I got an uncle���
[entering Andy's office] Hey, man. Selling cookies for Jada. Want the same as last year?
You just threw a milkshake in a restaurant where they make minimum wage.
C'mon Gwenneth.
And I'm gonna play this here share the wealth card.
That���s what I���m talkin��� about.
What are you doing with my lunch?
You think you could beat me up?
2,184 pounds, for a grand total -- oh! You all gained five pounds back.
Hmhmm.
Oh, hey Val.
Were the boxes near each other?
Once you read the packet, sign the back.
Come on! Just show me the Power Point.
Her mom wants me to take her to mass. I guess that's something to do.
Kelly ordered this online.
No, that's uh. Porn. Pornography. Old lady... nasty... porn.
Uh, 'The moon is huge tonight.'
Sup?
Hey! Do Not Touch My Radio.
I haven't been to New York in a long time.
What?
[as Cookie Monster] Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum.
Something wrong with the doll?
[Dwight and Jim enter office] Hey, hey. They're back. [Everyone greets them]
Delivered all my furniture to Philly. Hey, keep it down, though. Nobody knows I���m here.
They smell so bad.
I got a game. Cow surfing.
Scoopity-splash!
Hey man.
You ready for tonight? We gonna tear up the town?
And I'm telling them you guys sexually harassed my sister.
You ready for me?
Here we go. Go get him, Mike!
[answers phone] Hello?
We're going skating.
No.
[starts playing the tune to Seasons of Love while Andy sits down]
Because I wanted you to like me.
Why?
Hey. Hey, look, when you get done with your... [looks inside conference room] meeting, you should, uh, come to the break room. We're having a party.
Cheeseburger or hamburger.
How many people a year do you think get their arms cut off in a baler?
Oh [bleep] yeah.
Ed Truck hired me. Jo promoted me. Gabe listened to me. All you've ever done is say no to me. I have ambition. And you kept me at the same level for years.
I can hear you.
Condoms.
I'll be there.
And I���d only get to see Jada on the weekends. You know, I���m��� I���m not so sure I���d like living in Philadelphia.
I have a kid. Last week, Jim at home? That was no vacation.
What's up man?
Way
Like a joke? A knock-knock joke?
Are you kidding? You wait.
If we were living in Sweden, I wouldn't have to worry about this 'cause we'd have universal healthcare.
If you say so. Hey, good seeing you. Remember, I was never here. All right, then.
Da  na na na na.
There is no occasion for you to go near this stuff, okay?
Michael, you know you don't have to turn us all in. All you need is one scapegoat.
Finish the joke, Andy. What do African Americans call?
This is the last of it.
You remember? Yes!
I've been reading the comics to my daughter since she was three years old. Not once I have used the real captions to Family Circus. That crazy family is hilarious to her for one reason: me.
You should stop calling yourself 'baby daddy.'
Look, just be straight with me, man. You can be gay with Matt, just be straight with me.
What do you say?
Man, hook you up.
And replay.
I don���t do that anymore.
I didn't say 'a'ight.'
I brought those in. It's my birthday.  That's some stone-cold narcissism right there.
Whoa. I hadn't even thought of that.
Well see, um... in the gang world, we use something called Fluffy Fingers.
All right.
I can videotape it.
I just don't get it, Pam. I mean, you're a rational person.
Yeah. We're cool.
Yes sir. Thanks.
What's
You popped one kernel.
Yeah, we did it.
Nothing stupid about working for yourself. Hanging out with pro athletes, getting free tickets to the games. That���s why I���m doing it.
That could work.
Hang on little ladies. You don't need this thing, I'll go grab my synthesizer. [Everyone cheers]
[as Jim empties thermos into trash] Nah, nah, nah. You don't have to do that.
Hey, look, Pennsylvania license plate! That's crazy! All the way out here! Who can name all the states?
[enters the office with his daughter, who runs in and hugs Jim] Jada, no, no, no, Jada, what are you doing? [Jim looks knowingly at the camera] Oh. So sorry, guys. I hope my family didn't disrupt your meeting.
A buyout.
[Andy walks in Darryl's office] We should schedule meetings, because the days can slip away with chit-chat. Are you crying?
The experience...
It's defense.
This is not a good idea right here.
What kind of job?
Nice scatting, man.
It's Lejon Brames.
[in a feminine voice] Kevin can't come to the phone right now because he's busy with us.
Better get some decent speakers up here then, cause we���re gonna do this right.
Andy made me his consigliere. Which means Assistant Regional Manager. I guess he thought I'd be into The Godfather 'cause I'm black. Wrong! I'm into The Godfather 'cause I'm a cinephile. I like Scarface 'cause I'm black.
Thank God we only had a baler to deal with.
I'm very busy here, man.
Hey what's up? You called?
I'm out. And so is Toby.
Actually, that was the sound of me eating spaghetti. But I���m gonna let them think the other thing.
Welcome to the warehouse.
I thought that was your job.
Yeah, sure, sure. I'll be right in.
Thank you. 'Congratulations, Darryl. Let's get wasted.' 'Have fun today, big guy.' 'Aww, yeah. Party time. Whoo-whoop.'
Dwight, look, I���m sorry you���re having a hard time with this, okay? Athlead is my future. No disrespect to Dunder Mifflin, but if I can have fun at work, I want that.
Her.  Yes, 'her' is qualified to work a dangerous machine.  You are not.  Okay?
I'm sitting right here.
[holding camera] Here we go.
It's like Driving Miss Daisy, you know?
Tell 'em your story, Hide.
All right so the support belt. Now this one is mine. Doesn't get much use nowadays.
You just made a good idea, a great idea.
Yeah, when are they gonna do a Labradoodle that's just Lab?
Hey, what's up?
[On phone] Hello?....Justine! [laughs] Nice surprise! How you doin' baby?....Nah. No no, I didn't win. When I got promoted I stop-...what?...Yeah. Yeah, Glenn won....Oh, you wanna call him? Yeah, you should call him, congratulate him. That'll be-...What?....Oh, his number's in your old phone. Oh, you know what? I might have it right- [hangs up] Whoops.
Look, I heard about the office. Tough break.
My future's not gonna be determined by seven little white lotto balls. It's gonna be determined by two big black balls. I control my destiny. I do.
The baler can flatten a car engine.  It can cut off your arm and crush your entire body without skipping a beat.
Mr. Romanko, we were a day late on one of your deliveries, but two of our trucks were down for repairs. It���s very unlikely it would happen again.
You talk to Wade and Colin?
I didn't say anything.
Did you hire 'em?
So how was the drive in?
Yeah.
You're not as scary as Book Face, over there.
I hate goodbyes, so last week, when I left Dunder Mifflin for good, I pulled the old Irish Exit. Just slipped out without making a big deal. No hard feelings. No feelings at all.
Woah-Oh! Haven���t been in one of these in forever.
You're such a great friend.'
There you go.
Hey let's go to Poor Richard's.
I'm just glad we're gonna try it out.
I couldn't do it. I--- I ain't that strong.  And I ain't that brave.
Wow. Man. I hope he doesn���t regret it.
Don't don't bother Luke. Got it.
I did.
Take it out. Pick it up. Pick it up. Pick it up. Take it out.
Ohh, that sounds fun and Christmasy, you mean old grinch!
Paper business.
Dunder Mifflin.
I don't know, man, they might think we're drag queens.
That happens a lot?
Thank you.
Yeah, yeah me too. I think it���d be like��� You know what? [grabs basketball] I think it���d be like a Kevin Durant jump shot��� Perfecto! [shoots basketball at hoop on wall, basketball misses and lands in fish tank, killing the fish] Oh my god���
Yeah, I've seen Santa.
Back at the bus.  We were locked out.  Phyllis is sitting on the ground eating a dirty sandwich.
Yeah, I heard. It sounds kinda lame. [to camera] No offense. You going, Toby?
I don't
Chill, man. This plan is airtight.
Hey!
It's not safe, you don't have a license.
[chuckles in agreement] Huh ha! That's cool, man.
It���s 30 degrees out. You drinkin��� a mildshake?
[Jim puts popcorn bag in microwave] Hey, if you don't want to teach me Power Point, just say so.
The winner: under 'Special Skills,' Mr. Don Feiner put 'Juggling.' [laughter]
I didn't hire anyone if that's why you're here.
All right, let���s get this over with.
Ohh. Ok. I didn't realize we were doing trick questions. What's the safest way to go skiing? Don't ski! [office laughs]
How do I do that?
Val. You made it.
Nice.
Yo.
That's my office.
I'll come with you, show you how it's done.
We are hanging out-right now. You want some more of this?
[to Val] You know, I don't think I've ever been in this exact angle before. I was scared at first, but I like it.
Yeah.
You accept these terms?
And I will take you all down.
He���s been sailing for two days.
And you got half a million of these? Well I gotta try it.
You feel connected to this? [hold up his back brace]
Busses, though.  They get you home quick.
Sold! To Jim.
Oh, no. I mean, I want to, I just...I don't want to force you into something you don't want to do.
Like what?
No, no, Jim. This is different. This is everything.
I've been working out. But, the problem is, I've been building muscle underneath. And that top layer hasn't burned off yet. Awkward stage.
What's rap?
These are very dangerous machines down here, and the upstairs workers,
[makes sudden sharp turn to the left, causing DVD player to fall out open window, then grins to camera]
Popsicles?
Oh, what's up, Roy?
What the hell is wrong with you?
When I was a kid, my grandmother used to make me chocolate cake when I wasn't feeling good. She's not around to do that anymore. I'm sorry, I just need a moment to myself just to clear my head.
[Kevin scratches cookie order form and sniffs it] It's not a scratch-and-sniff, Kev.
Song's about truth.
And I fell and busted my ankle.  I'm legitimately scared for my workers.
Dwight?
Getting my sweat on.
Oh yeah, and um there's a Christmas party upstairs tonight, wanted to tell you about.
Nah. I play for pleasure.
[puts newspaper down] Wow. That dude is good.
YEAH! Da  na na na na.
I need you to sign these, we got a shipment going out.
Uh huh.
The space dust does it.
Andy, who punched you?
Make a real gym.
What do you want, baby? We got some granola, got some cupcakes, chips, apples, pies...
Shh! Movie's almost over.
She's got a boyfriend.
Go, Dwight Jr!
I put three pallets on the truck to Blue Cross once a week. They use a lot of paper.
That's what we gotta do.
Darryl is dating Val... still.
You're not staying?
Oh, I'm sorry Mike, some of my folks got to hear about this one.  [texting on cell phone] Ah. [laughs]
What happens when we're done chewing? Do we spit it out on the floor, or keep it in our mouths the rest of the time?
You're right, it's better than you! It's us! [sings] Dunder Mifflin.
Thanks T-Man, later.  [fist bumps Toby}
All right, I made it up.
[approaches Kevin] Would you like to buy some cookies?
Right on, son.
127 hours. It's about this guy who-
OK, everybody smile. Ho! You lost 31 pounds.
There was a time when the only people who texted you were people you wanted to text you. Girls. And they'd all say the same thing. 'I'm coming over baby.' And I would text back 'BTB', bring that booty.
Jim, I got my ass chewed out because one of your orders got messed up. And Andy, you said you drove him to the courthouse.
Perfect.
Ok, so um, what's his name? All the way in the back there.
I'll do it better than you. I earned it. I deserve it. I got passed over, God knows why, reasons I cannot and will not understand. The job was mine Andy, everyone said it was mine. Make me manager or fire me.
Hey, Pam! How are you?
I believe I want to go home.
You've got a booger bubble going on there.
Cool.
Yeah.
You know this would not happen if we had a union.
No.
Yes, Shawn Marion.
I shall come by at your convenience.
Processed.
Cannonball! [jumps in pool] Let's do this!
No.
Don't use his real name. George Howard Scubb. It's a devil name.
I'm not sleeping with your girlfriend.
What?
Fourteen years long.
Look man this is a bad idea.
That thing were you softly exhale on her neck.
It is worth it.
What kind of chicks are you going to meet there?
When I worked in the warehouse, I was part of that lotto pool. They won ��� playing my birthday.
Right.
It's getting late. I thought you guys could use a little [sets up laptop] inspiration.
We're friends. We're friends.
Mike, I'm very busy down here. [eats chicken]
Exactly like this.
[Singing] rub a dub dub���I got scrubbed.  ���Sup, darlin���? Everybody, this is Justine. [murmurs of hello from the group] This is Jim and Oscar, everybody.
My pleasure.
Hey, Mike, look. How bout we go upstairs, too. You know learn how the office works. We can all switch places today.
Jada don't want to spend Christmas with me. She told her mom it wasn't as much fun. And how could she say that? You know, I took her to the toy store to buy her own presents.
Take them at the same time.
They left you in the lurch, and if they want to jump in, it means you're almost there. You did this. Bring it home.
I was there. That dude is not engaged. I'm not a big believer in therapy, but I'll go into my own pocket to cover his co-pay.
Yeah, we're going to get clobbered.
I haven't hired anyone.
Good policy. Sensible. Smart.
[bluesy] Da na na na na...  da na na na  na...
I���ll introduce you.
No, wait. You're, you're supposed to... Never mind. Da  na na na na.
[reads text] Come to parking lot. Crazy pigeon action?
Dwight, come back and spot me.
Are you with us Mike?
Your mom?
No.
What are you doing here, Gabe?
[sighs] I���m gonna miss the paper business.
[driving truck] Hey, y'all are not gonna be playing these little private games all the way.
What have you done for me?
Yeah, just weekends for now, but pretty soon, I���m switching over.
I put some guys on tonight. Best of your bunch and my bunch. Tell you now though, it's gonna be mostly my bunch.
[on phone] Yes, there used to be a paper clip that would pop up and say 'Looks like you are writing a letter or resume. Would you like help? I believe his name was... [looks embarrassed at camera] Clippy.
Yeah, maybe everyone move one instrument to the right?
[noticing all the warehouse workers wearing homemade beanies] Wow. It's like the nation of Islam down here.
What? [Jim shrugs] How about yesterday?
No, no, no. Maybe just later.
Yes! [to video screen]  Right here. You are a naughty girl!
Roy left years ago. What's his name?
Yeah. You too, huh?
What?
That was a good one.
[on phone]It���s Darryl. Erin told me to pretend to be a cop and say your mom died.
Life hacking, man.
Taking a load off huh?
She was about to turn 97.
Thank you go much.
Who's it?
That's it.
Hey, Andy.
I don���t think I sh-
Please call me back.
Dwight.
WHAT!?
Well, when they merged the two branches together, they put
Dreaming he's a dog on a island.
You want to hold me, to see how you feel?
I can go get us some tacos.
I'll take one of those pink pouches.
Yeah, I guess���
Ok, kids. You've all been so good and unbelievably patient so I think you are gonna get some candy!
Something full of acid.
If we sell everything but the boat, your mom should be set for about six months.
You said no to this one!
You must be pretty strong, huh?
I think she could... sense my sadness, and I, and I found out too late that she... she's the copy editor at the Trib.
Yes, I am. Just so everyone's on the same page.
Then I think you should fire me.
Wow. Yeah, we gonna read it.
Kill their fish, and they still hire me. That���s how you do that, baby. It���s all good, I���m ready. Y���all ready for this? [sings intro to ���Everybody dance now���, points to Pam to sing first line]
Nice. Do the damn thing. - Pow! [they fist bump and explode]
Mm, it's not that big.
I've seen this, that's not you.
You wanna make me happy? Huh?
Curl up with your favorite DVD.
It���s not pizza.
Mike gave me a list of his top ten Springsteen songs. Three of them were Huey Lewis and the News. One was Tracy Chapman, Fast Car. And my personal favorite, Short People.
Why would you think a lady is me?
Stairs. Oh, man....
Okay, bring it home now.  And don't forget the new black man phrase I taught you.
But we get paid a lot less.
Dude.
One second, one second, one second. [stops playing] So, this song is from the point of view of a little girl?
2,336 pounds. Y'all need to learn some portion control.
That's crazy money. I'll take forty.
I'm not checkin' email till lunch. Four hour work week.
Damn!
We just have a lot of stuff down there that could be stolen.
It's getting bigger.
[to Kevin] What's a skinny guy like Toby know about cookies? You can't trust him to understand the wants and needs of the thick man. Maybe Toby from two years ago.
Don't just take the first job that comes your way. Cause next thing you know, it's ten years later and you���re still there. Could write your obituary tomorrow, it's not gonna change.
Val knit me a beanie. But I can't if it's a ���we're just friends��� beanie or a ���I'm hot, you're hot, let's get it poppin'��� beanie. So I'm gonna up the ante, give her a clearly romantic gift, and we'll get to the meaning of the beanie.
That's 'cause of you, Mike.  They're not gonna give the workin' man more than the boss.
Cool.
No no no no.  I like her.
Yeah, it's a little much.
Get under your chin first. Yeah.
Happy hour. My pleasure.
You're not talking... triple digits?
You could be.
You mean to tell me no one wanted an energy drink for Asian homosexuals?
And the game's over seconds later.
Yeah, I wanted the manager job, but I got somethin��� much better. This soda. This is mine.
Think that through for a sec.
Look, I need this. Ok? Your daughter is a pretty little girl. Let her go door-to-door. You think people gonna buy cookies from my [hesitates] chubby daughter?
We do safety training every year, or after an accident. ... We've never made it a full year.  This particular time, I was reaching for a supply box on the top shelf, when one office worker, who shall remain nameless, kicked the ladder out from under me and yelled...
Which usually means there's clothes all over the living room.
Andy, when I was twelve years old, we did a field trip, a lock-in at the zoo. I met this girl, I thought she was so perfect. I was in love with her. But when the sun came up, I knew it wasn't real, 'cause she was ugly and I had grown tired of her. I know you want reception today, but tomorrow you won't want to do her. She's a dog.
What's his name?
We���re in play, baby.
That sounds awesome!
Yeah.
No? OK. I don't wanna be here anymore. Fire me.
Give me your job.
Hooray. Live it up big D. ' 'Days like this don't come often enough. Time to celebrate. You deserve this'?
So?
Andy, sing us another song.
What's up man? I'm Darryl.
Let me see it!
No.
You just said you hated it.
Uh oh, look at this. Red plastic cup, red plastic cup. How about that?
You crushed our spirits, Gabe. Congrats. You're a big man, huh? Take a lot to destroy the creativity of a whole group of people. [notification tone] [laughter]
What, you don't like the blues?
I hate myself.
Whoa! That person has really gotten him or herself into quite a predicament.
Let me get this straight. You lost all of it. All your winnings. A hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
That's a great plan.
[in a feminine voice] Hi. This is Alex.
���Mandate���- Always think of two men on a date. [awkward moment] I have gay friends��� I have one gay friend. [to Jim] Oscar?
Check out this song I wrote: I'ma love you downstairs tonight... [overlapping chatter]
I told you we're way past rules. We have been for some time now. We start having rules now, everything we built collapses.
Okay.
Iverson. Yeah, always man. It's very important.
Anybody wanna take a guess?  Anybody?
Jim is happy here, selling paper at Dunder Mifflin?
Nine first.
Jim really doesn���t want to come?
[At Meredtith] Boo!
And we all know, baseball does not last forever.
Oh, hey. Hey, what���s up, y���all?
I have my daughter tonight; we're renting Charlotte's Web.
[laughs] Are you serious?  You're earning this?
Hey, y'all wanna hear some loud music or something?
Andy, it���s Darryl. Take your drawers off your head.
Hey.
Every day.
Alright.
[on phone] This is Darryl.
Good morning.
Mike.
I was born ready! No, I suck at interviews. I had Andy���s job in the bag until my interview.
All right. Thanks, man.
My priority is safety.
[freezes] Ummm��� [a moment later] Alright. Obviously y���all look really busy, and uh, I don���t want to waste your time anymore. Sorry, I just uhh��� Obviously I���m not qualified to be here man, I���m���  I���m a warehouse manager, you know���
Except my warehouse.
I would.
Super comfortable. Like sweatpants for my head.
Oh you could stay too.  He's got a big place.
You come to my house, bust up my trash cans, call my baby sister an ass****, and told her to eat dog food.
Aw, come on. What's the harm? [makes face] Mmm. What flavor was that?
Well, it���s been great.
[opening door to Deangelo's office] Hey, saw Jim come in.  We meeting?
Again, never agreed upon.
Cool. Okay. Sorry I lied.
Yeah.
Hope it's all right.
Hey Andy.
[taking photo with Jada] Let's see that smile. Go on. [waves to Val]
[Dwight heads toward a strip club] Oh, no, no, no. Uh-uh.
What? All right!
Yes. All of 'em. Together. It's a conspiracy. Listen to me, Mike, you gotta do something about them.
Is she sick? How are her poops?
I love Jim. I love that he hooked me up with a job. It's just, he uses old t-shirts as wash rags. He doesn't wash his dishes. Apparently, they need to [quote-unquote fingers] soak... He hooked me up with a job.
That's good.
Who?
No.
[pats Andy on the back] Thank you.
We'll go after Darth then.
I meant dressed up compared to normal. You usually dress like a ghost-buster.
I had no idea. This plumber has pipes!
Checkin' in with Chet. Doppler's up.
Whoa, I work at a paper company, those things terrify me. They could put us out of business, you know? I heard those machines hold like, ten books at once.
Can���t do what?
Hey, how'd you do?
There were times on the two and a half hour drive when I experienced doubt. That's the thing about long drives, you know, you're always going to- this is a gay bar.
Just a couple of grown, sexy-ass roommates.
Slow down, think it over.
Clever, Mike.
Eat it.
Alright. I mean, it's what you want, so...
A lot has changed since y'all left, okay? You're gonna have to jump through some hoops. And the new foreman is here. Now she's one of the best we've ever known, okay? So I need you to show her your upmost respect. Make sure she feels welcome and at home, okay? Can you do that?
Thanks man.
Hey, come here. You guys need to see this.
This is what you want?
This is the spookiest warehouse in the world, kids. You don't believe me? Just take a look. [Kevin chops into Erin, who is dressed as Princess Fiona] Oh. Scary, huh? This is a surgery with an octopus and a burn victim.
Yeah, you should.
Chicken piccata, salad on the side please.
A lot... of things.  Uh, you, uh... What about Jan?  Lovely, lovely, lovely Jan, man.  It's goin' good, right?
Start over.
Unh! Damn it!
Please...
I was rushing to fill an order.  I put the ladder up to grab a box of three hole from the top shelf.  Next thing I know, I'm on the ground and the ladder's on top of me.
What? Is he retiring? You getting him a gift or something?
I thought you'd wear a sweater.
Wrap it up, Gabe.
Didn't have to see. It was sales. I can feel it. They are out of control.
Good morning.
It's bad.
Right there.
No, you don't. You don't feel us. How can you? You know what?
That's what I've been trying to tell you, Mike.  It's serious down there.  We do dangerous stuff, man.  This is shenanigans, foolishness, Nerf-ball.  You live a sweet, little, Nerf-y life.  Sittin' on your biscuit.  Never havin' to risk it.
Uh. So I guess that was your mom who called me earlier looking for the address? Real deep voiced woman?
I had to. I needed defense.
Oh, I never sing with soul.
My resolution is to read more. And if someone else is driving me to the bookstore, I can eat my PB&J in the car. 2011 is coming up all Darryl.
Excuse me?
Next exit isn't for five miles.
My daughter.
Who knew, right?
He died.
You want me to invite Matt?
Hey, what���s up?
Sounds all right.
No.
No. No.
19, serving 4. [serves and scores]
Mm hmm.
Take your shot man!
Alright, we're going down to my warehouse, that means we're playing by my rules. No messing with the baler and be cool in front of me and Val. We just broke up.
No big deal. No big deal.
The coconut's pretty subtle.
I've never been lucky. And I'm not talkin' about the lottery, I'm talkin' 'bout stuff like developing a soy allergy at thirty-five. Who gets a soy allergy at thirty-five? And why is soy in everything?
That's when somebody really gets in your face, you know, you just... start tickling them.
There's nothing out here man.
Well you lost zero pounds. [everyone grumbles]  No change.  On the bright side you gained zero pounds.
You own a convertible. Come on man that's, that's hot. Women love that stuff right?
Who knows?
What?
Dallas indeed.
Would you just fire me, man?
Mmmmm.
Mike, this is the opposite of safety.  You jump, you're gonna serious hurt yourself.
Nah, nah...
[on the phone] I just, no, she be talking to your mom or something. This is my daughter too, Justine! You seem to think, [Justine hangs up] oh... pick a damn tree already.
Da  na na na na.
If this company���s going down, I wanna go down on it. With it. I wanna go down with it.
Oh?
Look, would ya... look.
All right.
Then why did you say 'Jackson Five?'
Thanks, man.
[whispering] They're a bunch of jackals.
Mm-hmm
We should play it.
Damn that was cold.
You got it. Pick it up. Take it out.
Everyday when I came into work, all I wanted to do was leave. So why in the world does it feel so hard to leave right now?
I���m lifting.
Hey, are we doing this thing?
Yeah, I'm gonna ask questions and I might not do what you say.
I���m going for a walk.
Newsies.
OK.
To the arcade.
Yeah. [music starts]
Come down, okay?
Yeah.
It's ok.
Guess I���m going upstairs.
Hunger for hamburger.
[scores] Here we go. Here we go. Here we go.
[walking by with new carpet] What... What's that?  Whatcha doing?
Man, you have got to be kidding me.
Yeah they kind of had a specific sound that didn't really fit in with our thing.
No. You're wrong.
Still no plan.
Yes sir. [notices Jim's using his coffee mug]
That's not a good reason.
I would if I owned it and I went broke.
Yup.
What's up, Roy?
This may be wrong. But there's a limit to what I would do for my child.
You're on.
You log in sales at ten different times. If you log ���em all at once, you save a lot of time. It's called batching.
No! No no no no no!  I said
Oh, yeah?
OK.
What's under your shirt?
Yeah. Can Dunder Mifflin afford that?
Gabe, tell us your stupid rules so we can start the game.
Okay, I'm not doing that.
Tacos were on sale, eight for $3!
No.
[Sitting outside building] Stop.
Yeah.
All right, this is just messed up.
Then you gotta have muscles, man. You got some muscles? Let's see.
It's cool. Reading's tricky sometimes.
She's trying.
More universal.
What's something you really care about?
Do it!
Dunder Mifflin.
Follow me, I got a space. After you.  I���ve been thinking about you all mornin���.  I don���t know what you did, I can barely walk today.
[in the bathroom with Robert[ Yeah, I guess sometimes I have nightmares about being buried alive.
Tracee Ellis Ross. Daughter of the First Lady of Motown, Diana Ross.
Which entitles me to half of both of y'alls money so if you don't mind.
Hell yeah, yeah, yeah. Mo'fo, mo'fo.
Why can't I just... tell you?
Me and Val were going nowhere and if I'm gonna be working in Philly, I'm gonna need my freedom. So, I convinced Val to breakup with me. Here's how you do it. You say, 'What are you gonna do, breakup with me?' Like it's a joke, and then you gain a lot of weight.
[trying not to laugh] Okay.
I'll be your croak monsieur.
Oh, yes! Yes! What'd I tell you? I knew he'd turn up [holds up an iPod inside speakers] You see that? This is the greatest night of my life.
No. I got some work to do. I do got big plans with this company.
Send me one too.
All right, got it. 2,210 pounds.
Anybody?
Because you're not a daddy, and it's not your baby.
OK, um, I like Erin's hair. It's a very pretty color.
Should you drive the forklift?
This... [removes camera headset]
Pick it up.
Man, see... That's what I've been sayin', man. We need to do this finally.
Uh weight lifting yeah.
Paper material, ma'am.
Ten people, Michael. Ten people.  Would you like to be one of them?
Yep.
Usually that life is short and tragic. That's okay, right?
Uh uh uh. Don't shush me.
Boo! Boo!
This doesn't concern you man, you need to walk away.
Yeah that's true.  You gotta call your girl, and get paid.  Show her who wears the pants in the relationship.
Come on man. I'm being serious. Don't joke.
So this is cool. I think we make a good fit. [stands up]
You don���t have to say it if you���re doing it.
You mean what did we do the last time the warehouse won the lottery?
Oh, thanks. Thanks. No.
Hey, Mike.
Seriously?
Man, we can see all your business coming around the corner, okay? You need to, you know, hide the... good thing you don't have a lot of business to start with.
I got Source Code on the way back.
Why do you wanna work here?
[clears throat]
It's not just today, it's everyday. It seems like the better title I have, the stupider my job gets.
A car parked in the sun is like a toaster oven.
Mike.
All right, fine, you know what? One o'clock.
Everybody got a government cow.
Yes. How did he do?
[Falls backwards onto the food table] Oh! Whoa!
Oh, this is a gift, for....my man Nate here.
No.
I like the sound of this. [looks at Dwight] Maybe one day I'll be sitting in Michael's chair. Wouldn't that be something?
That's regular text talk.
Hey... [sighs] You know what, I could use a breath of fresh air. Let's do it.
Nothing. [pulls out a can of soda] It's mine. [Jim shakes his head] [after looking through DVR] What happened to my Tavis Smileys?
Dracula.
Cool. Hey, thanks���
You don't say?
If you don't enter them immediately, you forget. What?
Just getting a tea bag.
Yeah, he look like Hillary Clinton.
Hi.
Hey, get off.
Oh, oh, I���m sure we did.
[rubs face in exasperation]
Let me see it.
Hey.
Yes.
Yes, thanks to you, who promoted me, after we, uh, interfaced.
My biggest fear is that someone will distract us from getting all the shipments out on time.
Mike, I am not having fire-eaters in a paper warehouse.
I don't have a plan exactly. More of a loose structure. Gives me freedom to improvise. It's like jazz. [scatting] Andy don't mess with me. [continues scatting] I'll figure something out.
I saw a TLC show on Kate Walsh's home office. All corkboard.
You want to dance?
But... [Val kisses Darryl]
Ehh, that's not who I'm talking about.
I know, right.  Merry Christmas.
So if I started singing ���Down By the Old Mill Stream���, you couldn't join me in a three part harmony. [Andy and Officer Foley shake their heads no, Darryl begins singing] Down by the, down by the, down by the....
He's got to go, Mike.
Has that ever happened? Ever?
I been selling here for five years. This is my spot.
Mmm. [they clink cups]
I don't know.
Get your own raise.  You gotta get out there and earn, son.
[interrupting] Stop talking 'bout it. I said I'm fine with it.
You hired your actor friend to come here as a cop?
Yeah, she ended things.
If I were Val, I would break up with Brandon. Then I would date the hell out of me. I wouldn't give in to me too fast, let me buy myself some nice dinners and such. But when I finally did give in, I would go crazy on myself.
Ahh���We don't really do those. We just sign the thing.
That there's a woman's suit.
You're the tutorial.
No, he doesn't. [to Michael] I told her Santa would be here.
Hey.
I'm in.
Oh, Mi... ! Hey, stop the video! Michael, stop it right there! Stop it right there! That's that girl from that thing. [pointing at Redheaded Actress] I banged this girl right here. This is...
Yes, yes, yes.
What's up, Mike?
OK, don't fire me.
I was in The Whiz in high school.
Hey, hey, hey. I���ll do one thing with y���all.
[Low singing] Old, mill, stream.
Hey, I like you.  Oh yeah, what's not to like?  But you need to access your uncrazy side, otherwise maybe this thing's run its course.
So this is a ten-gallon hat, huh?
Hmm. Yeah right
[tears welling up in his eyes]
It's one of my favorite regions? Did I just sound totally lame? No, I sounded good.
This party���s tight.  The fog is cool.
To look good for Val!
Yes, as a matter of fact, I uh��� [pulls booklets from his bag] I wrote some down. There you go. [passes out booklets] Wow, this guy came prepared, it impresses me! [group laughs]
Both.
Higher. [motions with hand to go up more]
Well, [points at Michael] those are some awful tight pants you have on. Where'd you get em? Like Queers R Us?
Back off! I got my reasons.
Well, it's simple Mike. I mean we merged these two branches right?  So now we're shipping twice as many orders as we used to.  With Roy gone we got a smaller crew.  And I'm pickin' up all of his slack, so I think I should be compensated fairly, by gettin' a raise.
What else could you possibly be forgetting?
Dunder Mifflin.
Seriously, that was hot. Feel like you and the newsman had a groove going.
Two years ago, Andy blamed the warehouse for a late shipment that he forgot to process. We got yelled at pretty bad. Almost lost my job, and I was mad as hell at the time. But I said 'Darryl, just wait. He's a fool. There's gonna be an opportunity. Just be patient.' [smiles]
You could go downstairs and ask them?
[reads text] 'Are you watching this?' Seriously?
Nahh! [shakes head] No. Not Justine. Never Justine.
Hey, Devil's Den is that way, we should check it out. That's where the snipers hid.
Well, I'm sorry if it seems that way to you.
Go ahead.
Damn! Jim, you got a real Facebook energy going on here man. You Zuckerberged this place out!
Oh, don't worry about it.
You're new to the game. You learned a lesson today. See you next year, sport.
Well, it's effective.
How much did you pay for that?
Not really.
It���s ok E-Dog, just who called?
Are you wearin' lady clothes?
Comfortable, Mike?
Your girlfriend? Is your girlfriend Val?
Yeah, that���s crazy.
[Talks drunk angry] Jim, that guy. [Scoffs] You gotta stick to your word! Like when you say something to a buddy, a real buddy...what are you gonna do, lie? To your buddy? [Sighs] It's awful.
How about the sales department is the sails?
It can.
All right, what's up Mike?
Good slam.
Action!
Hey.
That's big of you, man. Takes a lot of courage.
Jim was nice enough to give me his bedroom.
That was a triple.
Looking good, RC!
Thank you. Thank you. No.
I'm back together with Val. Yay...
Think about it! What other mammal, besides humans, drinks the milk of another mammal? I mean, you don't see a bear drinking raccoon milk.
We wanted to give you something.
You should talk in a higher voice 'cause the camera makes you sound weird.
Daaamn!  Mad respect for my brotha!
Hey, man. Darryl.
Silent. Look, congratulations.
You really re-did Andy's office, huh?
Cool, cool. Alright, see you later.
I find you absolutely ribbiting!
It's not even a thought���
I'll never be sorry, not for a moment of it.
I have plans later.
And?
Actually, you did.
I was still thinking of going back to school.
Presbyterian.
Look you need to pick yourself up. Man up, alright? You will win this in the end. It's all about heart, and character. Be your best self.
It was in the box.
She thought I was McNabb. [laughing]
Four hours. Almost halfway there.
Thanks. [to Val] Nice flowers.
[talking head] I'm driving them up for five times what I would've made at work. I thought I made a good deal. [expression changes from smiling to downcast] Then I realized I'm gonna be trapped in a truck with Mike all day.
You done?
We can look into it.
[leaving someone a message on his cell phone, looking very uncomfortable] Hey what's up, I just thought I'd try you. I was thinking about that story where you ran into the girl you used to babysit.
This is too good.
No, no, no...
No, that's not as much fun. You know what?
���This coupon entitles you to one free tickle monster attack���
Shhh. If we don't listen to the overture, we won't recognize the musical themes when they come back later.
[in a dress shirt and tie] Like what?
My summer, I, um, blew out my knee playing softball. Ended up watching CNN most of the time. I don't know how we're going to get out of Afghanistan. I hate the new assistant. He's only been here for a week, and I hate him.
I don't know, man. Y'all quit with a lot of confidence. I mean, it was like, y'all came up in here dancing and everybody was- [sees Val] ooh, hold on a second. [sees Brandon] Oh.
Mike, this is barely more than I make.  You been here ten years, dog. [laughs]
[to camera] There it is.
[on cell phone] Fourteen years.  Fourteen.  I know.  [laughing]  Ok, alright.  I gotta go.  Later.  [hangs up]
Yeah.
I didn���t realize we were this close.
Stupidest thing I've ever heard.
One of 'em, Glenn, is starting one of those fat camps where he steals your kid in the middle of the night. Madge and a couple other guys might start a strip club, but on a boat. And Heday is investing in an energy drink for Asian homosexuals. [Andy laughs awkwardly]
Looked like it. Sometimes when I'm down like this, it helps to sing the blues.
That's my go-to thermos. That's all.
Yeah, totally crazy. Puts me in an insane asylum just thinking about it. I'm stranded on shutter island over here.
Yeah where is it?
No, no, no.
Local musician? Local legend! I used to come hear you play every week at the Deerhead.
This doesn't help me. I don't respond to that kind of strategy.
Uh��� yeah. Depending on traffic.
Actually, Andy, we call this one Dwight, Jr.
I was talking like this. [mouths words while pointing to his ear] I don't feel good about it, but he just kept calling himself a gunshot victim and it got to me.
What? You making bread?
I'll answer that, Jim. I would use it as an opportunity to teach, uh, about actions... and consequences... of actions. [Jim and Gabe stare at Darryl]
Apparently we have a visitor. Gabe, everyone.
[setting stopwatch] Go.
I didn't have time because of my daughter.
Obviously you know how a gym works. So you know I���m not going to pay money for this. You want people to come to your gym? Make a real gym.
No.
Union! Union, yeah.
This is gonna make him feel better.
Yeah, Jim.
$30.00
Good luck with that.
It's like she only wants to hook up when Ryan comes around.  It's gotten to the point where I get excited every time I see that little dude walk through the door.
What you need flour for, Jim?
How about you, man.  Comfortable?
This is embarrassing, Michael.
Yes.
Heading to Philly. Interview with Jim���s company.
What?
You went to Cornell?
[To himself] Back for more, huh? [Gets up and walks towards Jim]
Figured I look presentable. [looks Michael over] You? [Michael dressed casually in jeans and sneakers] Went a different way.
What up?
No, that's not a good idea. I don't see that as a very good song.
I love the desert. It's one of my favorite ecosystems.
Yes. I do remember saying something like that to you.
Pepper's been getting me out of the house, going on runs.
You���re a bad man Andy Bernard.
I got too much ice cream. You want some?' 'Getting' my fry on.'
Really?
Yeah, well, watcha gonna do?
I say we have a parade.
Goodnight.
Your friends are like Spider-man, if he had gotten bitten by a spider and then got really into masturbating.
Hell yeah!
Hey, hey, hey. Vick did his time.
Nope. His name is Michael. [Michael makes the da dum ksch on the drumset again]
Oh, it works. Him and me, all right, we are crazy in love. More love than your small mind can comprehend. And we have two disposable incomes. And no kids. And we're taking our business elsewhere. [Oscar and Darryl exit holding hands]
I have a file of applicants here. I just gotta open it, look at it, interview a bunch of guys,hire some of 'em. So I'd say we're in the early stages of the process.
Make a delivery.
Who needs it?
Hey Val. Want a beer? It might taste better than that pool water you've been drinking.
It says decaf. You get me decaf?
Sounds great.
Ahem!
Yeah, I'll say something. I think we should be acknowledging our boss, because none of us would be here without him. Robert California! [everyone toasts]
Yep.
Hey I'm not gonna tell you this stuff if you gonna throw it back in my face.
It's so strong.
I taught Mike some, uh, phrases to help with his interracial conversations. You know, stuff like, 'Fleece it out.' 'Going mach five.' 'Dinkin' flicka.' You know, things us Negroes say.
So it really bothers me when somebody comes in here speeding around on a lift, playing with it like a toy. It kind of gets under my skin.
Come on, be for real Mike.
I agree. I think it's superb.
[singing in different tune] Out of paper, out of stock, there's friendly faces around the block, break loose from the chains that are causing your pain. Call Michael, Stanley, Jim, Dwight or Creed. Call Andy and Kelly for your business paper needs. Call Dunder Mifflin.
You���re gonna po��� mouth
Somebody just needs to get her attention, tell her it's not OK to do this in public.
What college did you go to Mike?
Yeah.
That sounds fun, mucking around in the dump. Wish I could go.
Nope. I'm good. I'm here. Let's find some warehouse workers.
I can't. You know that.
No. Thank you for your interest in my truck.
Some freaky stuff going on. I was walking behind Gabe and I heard some things.
Apt. Apt analysis, Robert.
Oh yeah.
[playing ping-pong] Game, son!
No. Can't let you do that Mike.
So I���m like a three year old girl in this scenario���
Well, shall we make it a little interesting?
You too... Darryl.
You didn't have to boo him.
Who knows what the belt is for?
Dude, I'm gonna be here all week, right? Five days a week, I figure I'll start slow.
[laughs] That's a text. [high fives Andy]
I can���t really picture it. Can you... get it on there. Yeah. And maybe, get the cheeks.
Yeah, but then they moved the panel to the same weekend and the Doc crew paid to fly us in. It was kismet.
Hey! He deserves this. And he said I could get in on it too.  [whispers] Yeah.
Obviously, so happy for them both.
Every day I have a blueberry muffin. Today, I did not have a blueberry muffin. Should have had the blueberry muffin... especially considering how incredibly superstitious I am.
Michael.
I'm sure they don't regret having their child, let's move it to the pros.
Okay, shush it. This was a mistake. Let's go. [Darryl and Jada leave, Ryan slowly shakes his head]
Alright, yeah fine so whatever...
No.
Maybe forever. Anyhow���
It's more than necessary, Mike. We need this. Roy? You still have that card from the Dockworker's Union?
I think if I had parents like that I'd be trying to convince everyone all the time how great I was, too.
Maybe the grinch hid the Christmas star, and we could ask for clues, and he'll tell us if we're hot or cold.
[exits Andy's office smiling] All I need is Kevin. Dude buys more cookies than everyone combined and then some. [Kevin waves at him] When I first started selling cookies he was a relatively thin man. Not a thin man, mind you. Relatively thin.
Cool.
Da  na na na na.  No, no, check it out, look. Da  na na na na... want to do that?
Toby! Dwight!  Is that them?
What? Must���ve been another devilishly handsome debonair individual.
You say we're the same, but we get compensated very differently.
[feeding a squirrel] I'm giving him a peanut.
Eat. It.
Let���s get a drink in you, huh?
He's not my hire, but I know who he is.
I don't know who's got you upset but my advice is stop crying.
Then I guess I figured out where I stand. This is a love beanie.
Hey Michael. This ain't over.
You gotta include me in the conversation.
Yeah.
Why? 'Cause I'm from the hood?
I feel good today. My little girl Jada? It's my turn to have her for Christmas this year. Two years ago I had her, and we had the best time. I tivoed her favorite shows, some things I've never heard of. iCarly... You know who's funny on that show? The friend with the video camera. He's got a nice way of talking.
It's trivia.
I just did, like, 35 minutes on the treadmill.
Subway sandwiches.
Hey!  How about instead of yelling at our sweet little Miss Kapoor over five hundred sheets of paper you get back to your desk.  Start sellin' multiple reams like a man.
What you say, bitch? You know, you might be right.
I love it. And it���s Athleap now. And the city is amazing.
Andy Bernard can't squirt water in his eye and act like it doesn't freak him out. But you know who can? Older Male Lab Assistant Number One.
Pam.
Thinking about my grandmother a lot.
All right, I'm being a jerk. You got me this job. I should be grateful. I am, I just... you know, I get finicky about my stuff. That's all.
It's all good, we got this.
You haven't even introduced yourself.
Why, did you meet someone?
That's what we need.
That's fascinating. Tell me, what's the significance of the peach orchard, thought?
You did good. Real good.
It has been processed.
Is that grease on my floor?
I usually watch TV during my lunch breaks. It's cool?
Thank you. [Kevin grabs cookie and starts eating it]
I wouldn't enjoy that.
I asked for a list. [Dwight rides in on a tricycle, laughing diabolically] ...and a clown.
Okay, I'm gonna need you to make this right or else we can't be right.
Tacos.
No. I was clearing my throat.
Actually, Val, why don't you come with? I'll need the extra hands to carry them back.
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa! So you're just gonna throw away perfectly good food?
What? Wait, wait, wait? So what? This happening?
I know it's hard Mike. Break-ups hurt.
Do you understand that?
What's wrong with a level playing field?
We got an offer on the table.
I know who did that.
No, it's my plumber. Says so in his bio. Apparently the director discovered him doing karaoke. It's his first play. He didn't even audition.
Whoa! Hold on.
Okay. I'll keep working.
You chose one thing?
I just think you���re going into this a little fast.
Say stuff like, 'Good morning, Good Afternoon'. People appreciate that.
This was your freshman year.
Yeah.
Lightbulb's burnt out, so it's dark. And the heat from the backup generator keeps it nice and warm. Sometimes I think about it when I'm trying to fall asleep at home. But as far as the rest of the office goes, it doesn't exist, okay?
Cool.
Actually, Andy, you promised me five minutes to talk about productivity suggestions���
How would you like it if we booed you?
Yeah, Jim's going to philly tomorrow. He said he was gonna take me with him, but that was two months ago. And I haven't heard anything since. I mean, he said that, right?
We did it! Hey, and look, the buyers wanna make sure it���s not just a Philly play, so get this: they���re gonna pay for us to go pitch out west. We talking Spurs, the Jazz, Cowboys. Blake Griffin, baby.
Don't go breaking my scale.
Oh my God, I think I see the imprint of a ring pop.
What'd I tell you about building forts in my warehouse?
Here's what I'm gonna do, I'm calling corporate and I'm filing a complaint against both of you.
Yeah!  Da  na na na na.
Good times.
It was kind of mumbled, I don't know, uh, only thing I could make out clearly was 'Andy,' 'Problem,' 'Eliminate,' something. I don't know what it meant.
Me.
Yeah. Yeah, it���s hot. The music is awesome. And the tacos are���for real.
[looks to camera for several seconds] At least it's quiet.
I know he loves his pick up truck.
Three Kings.
Summing up.
I'm telling you how to do this man.
What?! Really?
Sure.
Yeah, but I never said you had nothing to live for.
Thanks, man.
I did. I did have a fantastic basement. Now it smells like tacos. You can't air out a basement and taco air is heavy. Settles at the lowest point.
Already on it. I ordered them by their Google trend ranking so we know who to hit first.
Show them what you brought, Mike.
I don't know. You gonna wash it? Or you gonna let it soak?
Well, yeah, what can I say, a player���s gotta play.
You!
Alright, we outta here.
Snap, for real?
I'm done. I gotta get out of here.
What do you mean ���they left���?
When did I get so fat?
Damn!
It does not say dangerous. And there's no exclamation point.
I like the sound of that. Is Kevin in?
We livin��� like rock stars. I���m about to eat free steaks with my sports heroes in 32 different cities.
But you're singing it.
You feel connected to his baby over there?
I know, I know. It's just hard.
Oh, my bad. Goodbye, everybody.
It's dangerous, Michael. Come on, get off this.
No, no, I���m not here actually. These donuts are part of my escape from the guys at the warehouse I didn���t say goodbye to.
I loved it.
Da  na na na na .
Really? That is messed up man.
Got it.
No man, we are.
What?  I can't hear you.
A book about oceans.
I'm very busy with time-sensitive work.
Why?
Here is an old man and a goth dude... and then the old crone from Drag Me to Hell.
I'm good.
Da  na na na na!!
Oh, ok.
Daaaaamn! It just keeps on coming, huh?
This seems like the kind of thing white people with dreadlocks do.
They have fast food in Philly.
I'ma call Roy, man.
Too late.
I'll come with you.
Hold up, I'm looking at my spit with a microscope.
Oh, hey.
Uh... [looks at camera] yes?! I was. [sits back down] Little joke!
You know, get it right.
[sighs]
