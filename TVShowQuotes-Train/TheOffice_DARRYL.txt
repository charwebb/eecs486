Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa! So you're just gonna throw away perfectly good food?
Yes sir.  Remember that.  I'll be right outside if you need me
But you want me to put it back in the truck.
[singing] Out of paper, out of stock, there's friendly faces around the block, break loose from the chains that are causing your pain.
Look, just be straight with me, man. You can be gay with Matt, just be straight with me.
Gabe, tell us your stupid rules so we can start the game.
There's a grill in the warehouse I could bring.
No. I got some work to do. I do got big plans with this company.
I've been working out. But, the problem is, I've been building muscle underneath. And that top layer hasn't burned off yet. Awkward stage.
Ohh. Ok. I didn't realize we were doing trick questions. What's the safest way to go skiing? Don't ski! [office laughs]
All right man, don't cry.  It's cool.  I'll let you get it for $400.
What kind of chicks are you going to meet there?
Then I guess I figured out where I stand. This is a love beanie.
Hey, man. How are you doing? I, um���I didn���t call ���cause I figured you changed the number.
If this company���s going down, I wanna go down on it. With it. I wanna go down with it.
What? Must���ve been another devilishly handsome debonair individual.
There were times on the two and a half hour drive when I experienced doubt. That's the thing about long drives, you know, you're always going to- this is a gay bar.
Yeah. Just put me out of my misery.
I've been reading the comics to my daughter since she was three years old. Not once I have used the real captions to Family Circus. That crazy family is hilarious to her for one reason: me.
Think about it! What other mammal, besides humans, drinks the milk of another mammal? I mean, you don't see a bear drinking raccoon milk.
That's when you hit me with what's getting you down, okay?
Maybe I'll stay overnight.  Got a cousin lives down there.
I am serious, Mike.  That's a 10% raise.  That's what I want.
Yes. All of 'em. Together. It's a conspiracy. Listen to me, Mike, you gotta do something about them.
[Singing] rub a dub dub���I got scrubbed.  ���Sup, darlin���? Everybody, this is Justine. [murmurs of hello from the group] This is Jim and Oscar, everybody.
Okay, I'll start.  It's pretty simple really. I uh, I think I deserve a raise.  I'm scheduled to get one in six months, but I'd like that to be moved up to now.
Yeah, ok so what, you buy 40 boxes?
And I'm gonna play this here share the wealth card.
Actually, that was the sound of me eating spaghetti. But I���m gonna let them think the other thing.
OK, everybody smile. Ho! You lost 31 pounds.
[in background] You have to be alert, and calm. And always careful...
I hate goodbyes, so last week, when I left Dunder Mifflin for good, I pulled the old Irish Exit. Just slipped out without making a big deal. No hard feelings. No feelings at all.
Yeah, and then he starts tickling you. You know, pretty soon you're laughing and hugging. Before you know it, you've forgotten the whole thing. Ya'll can just go to church together... get an ice cream cone.
Ok, so um, what's his name? All the way in the back there.
My biggest fear is that someone will distract us from getting all the shipments out on time.
This doesn't concern you man, you need to walk away.
Okay, shush it. This was a mistake. Let's go. [Darryl and Jada leave, Ryan slowly shakes his head]
If I were Val, I would break up with Brandon. Then I would date the hell out of me. I wouldn't give in to me too fast, let me buy myself some nice dinners and such. But when I finally did give in, I would go crazy on myself.
One more, yeah. [Again motions to go even higher]
Don't just take the first job that comes your way. Cause next thing you know, it's ten years later and you���re still there. Could write your obituary tomorrow, it's not gonna change.
I got too much ice cream. You want some?' 'Getting' my fry on.'
What happens when we're done chewing? Do we spit it out on the floor, or keep it in our mouths the rest of the time?
No, that's not as much fun. You know what?
[driving truck] Hey, y'all are not gonna be playing these little private games all the way.
Just a hunch. Your gift is on the way.
Oh yeah, and um there's a Christmas party upstairs tonight, wanted to tell you about.
So this is cool. I think we make a good fit. [stands up]
[approaches Kevin] Would you like to buy some cookies?
Oh, in the warehouse we use code names for people we want to talk about. Andy was Jelly Roll. Mike was Dennis the Menace. Ryan was douche bag.
Okay, bring it home now.  And don't forget the new black man phrase I taught you.
That doesn't mean anything. [to Kevin] Kevin, do you want to buy cookies from me?
Hey, man, you put together a pretty fun night for everybody. I saw you talking to Hide. Did you hear that dude's life story? It's amazing, right?
Don't use his real name. George Howard Scubb. It's a devil name.
Yes sir. [notices Jim's using his coffee mug]
Mike, you can't do that. It's conflict of interest.
Hey, um, my daughter said you traded her a headband for her Nintendo DS?
Sometimes it seems like it was better down in the warehouse, you know?
[Falls backwards onto the food table] Oh! Whoa!
I was rushing to fill an order.  I put the ladder up to grab a box of three hole from the top shelf.  Next thing I know, I'm on the ground and the ladder's on top of me.
Hey, I think this guy playing Sweeney Todd is my plumber.
The winner: under 'Special Skills,' Mr. Don Feiner put 'Juggling.' [laughter]
When I was a kid, my grandmother used to make me chocolate cake when I wasn't feeling good. She's not around to do that anymore. I'm sorry, I just need a moment to myself just to clear my head.
Every day I have a blueberry muffin. Today, I did not have a blueberry muffin. Should have had the blueberry muffin... especially considering how incredibly superstitious I am.
That's when somebody really gets in your face, you know, you just... start tickling them.
Da  na na na na.  No, no, check it out, look. Da  na na na na... want to do that?
[playing video game with Jim] Oh. Come on!
Some freaky stuff going on. I was walking behind Gabe and I heard some things.
Follow me, I got a space. After you.  I���ve been thinking about you all mornin���.  I don���t know what you did, I can barely walk today.
I was in The Whiz in high school.
And I���d only get to see Jada on the weekends. You know, I���m��� I���m not so sure I���d like living in Philadelphia.
Well, when they merged the two branches together, they put
One second, one second, one second. [stops playing] So, this song is from the point of view of a little girl?
I have no idea what his problem is, that's just my standard advice. It's good advice right?
You mean what did we do the last time the warehouse won the lottery?
Well see, um... in the gang world, we use something called Fluffy Fingers.
I don't understand the point of a hat.
Hang on little ladies. You don't need this thing, I'll go grab my synthesizer. [Everyone cheers]
My summer, I, um, blew out my knee playing softball. Ended up watching CNN most of the time. I don't know how we're going to get out of Afghanistan. I hate the new assistant. He's only been here for a week, and I hate him.
Val knit me a beanie. But I can't if it's a ���we're just friends��� beanie or a ���I'm hot, you're hot, let's get it poppin'��� beanie. So I'm gonna up the ante, give her a clearly romantic gift, and we'll get to the meaning of the beanie.
Here's what I'm gonna do, I'm calling corporate and I'm filing a complaint against both of you.
2,336 pounds. Y'all need to learn some portion control.
Okay, can you just stand right there?  [snaps camera phone picture] I gotta send some e-mails.
Well, I'm sorry if it seems that way to you.
Come on, now, Justine, look... Listen, look, I've been planning this, okay? You cannot do this, Justine.
Yes, as a matter of fact, I uh��� [pulls booklets from his bag] I wrote some down. There you go. [passes out booklets] Wow, this guy came prepared, it impresses me! [group laughs]
No, no, I���m not here actually. These donuts are part of my escape from the guys at the warehouse I didn���t say goodbye to.
[clapping] You got this, Roy. [Roy begins playing and singing She's Got a Way by Billy Joel, Pam and Jim looked shocked, Phyllis and Bob begin making out]
I know Citizen Kane. Rosebud didn't explain why he was how he was, it just represented what was important to him as a child, that he missed.
Seriously, that was hot. Feel like you and the newsman had a groove going.
[noticing all the warehouse workers wearing homemade beanies] Wow. It's like the nation of Islam down here.
Hey, I like you.  Oh yeah, what's not to like?  But you need to access your uncrazy side, otherwise maybe this thing's run its course.
Your friends are like Spider-man, if he had gotten bitten by a spider and then got really into masturbating.
No, that's not a good idea. I don't see that as a very good song.
Ed Truck hired me. Jo promoted me. Gabe listened to me. All you've ever done is say no to me. I have ambition. And you kept me at the same level for years.
Let me put my shoes on. [hangs up phone, dial tone]
I know he loves his pick up truck.
I'm telling you how to do this man.
Yeah, I taught Mike some new phrases.  I want him to get the raise, I... just can't help myself.
You know this would not happen if we had a union.
[walking by with new carpet] What... What's that?  Whatcha doing?
This thing could take your arm off, your head off, you know, just exercise caution.
So I���m like a three year old girl in this scenario���
Uh oh, look at this. Red plastic cup, red plastic cup. How about that?
So, the guy shows me the deck he's built. And I'm like, 'I'll call this a deck if it'll make you happy, but this is just a porch without a roof.' [laughter, Oscar looks toward door] It was ridiculous man, it was like-you could maybe get two chairs on the thing. Two lawn chairs.
Oh, yeah, I taught him a handshake, too.
Yeah, Jim's going to philly tomorrow. He said he was gonna take me with him, but that was two months ago. And I haven't heard anything since. I mean, he said that, right?
You need to change your standard for what's worthy of a text. Ask yourself is this something Darryl needs to know. The answers almost always no.
Come on! Just show me the Power Point.
Hey, y'all wanna hear some loud music or something?
I put some guys on tonight. Best of your bunch and my bunch. Tell you now though, it's gonna be mostly my bunch.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. For sure. For sure. for sure. Man!  And Pam's into it?
I can���t really picture it. Can you... get it on there. Yeah. And maybe, get the cheeks.
How many people a year do you think get their arms cut off in a baler?
There is no occasion for you to go near this stuff, okay?
Mike, this is barely more than I make.  You been here ten years, dog. [laughs]
How about the sales department is the sails?
Get your own raise.  You gotta get out there and earn, son.
Probably shouldn't tell you this, but a lotta guys in the warehouse work multiple jobs, so... we have a place.
I been selling here for five years. This is my spot.
Obviously you know how a gym works. So you know I���m not going to pay money for this. You want people to come to your gym? Make a real gym.
No, we got a truck going out at 1:15. So, that's the busy time.
Actually, Andy, you promised me five minutes to talk about productivity suggestions���
Dude, I'm gonna be here all week, right? Five days a week, I figure I'll start slow.
No. Thank you for your interest in my truck.
[Andy walks in Darryl's office] We should schedule meetings, because the days can slip away with chit-chat. Are you crying?
I have my daughter tonight; we're renting Charlotte's Web.
Aw, come on. What's the harm? [makes face] Mmm. What flavor was that?
[chuckles in agreement] Huh ha! That's cool, man.
Meredith's a little cute. I'm just realizing. She got, like, a Emma Stone thing.
[feeding a squirrel] I'm giving him a peanut.
You have one more free throw shoot. Come on.
So it really bothers me when somebody comes in here speeding around on a lift, playing with it like a toy. It kind of gets under my skin.
Yeah, I wanted the manager job, but I got somethin��� much better. This soda. This is mine.
I was talking like this. [mouths words while pointing to his ear] I don't feel good about it, but he just kept calling himself a gunshot victim and it got to me.
Yes. I do remember saying something like that to you.
Um no. This is not a gym. This is like a scene out of Saw 5.
[in the bathroom with Robert[ Yeah, I guess sometimes I have nightmares about being buried alive.
Whoa, I work at a paper company, those things terrify me. They could put us out of business, you know? I heard those machines hold like, ten books at once.
Tracee Ellis Ross. Daughter of the First Lady of Motown, Diana Ross.
There was a time when the only people who texted you were people you wanted to text you. Girls. And they'd all say the same thing. 'I'm coming over baby.' And I would text back 'BTB', bring that booty.
Damn! Jim, you got a real Facebook energy going on here man. You Zuckerberged this place out!
Andy, this is inappropriate. People died here, man.
It does not say dangerous. And there's no exclamation point.
All right, I'm being a jerk. You got me this job. I should be grateful. I am, I just... you know, I get finicky about my stuff. That's all.
You log in sales at ten different times. If you log ���em all at once, you save a lot of time. It's called batching.
You're on your own, Mike. [gets up and starts to walk away]
Yeah, maybe everyone move one instrument to the right?
And we all know, baseball does not last forever.
Figured I look presentable. [looks Michael over] You? [Michael dressed casually in jeans and sneakers] Went a different way.
Well, [points at Michael] those are some awful tight pants you have on. Where'd you get em? Like Queers R Us?
[On phone] Hello?....Justine! [laughs] Nice surprise! How you doin' baby?....Nah. No no, I didn't win. When I got promoted I stop-...what?...Yeah. Yeah, Glenn won....Oh, you wanna call him? Yeah, you should call him, congratulate him. That'll be-...What?....Oh, his number's in your old phone. Oh, you know what? I might have it right- [hangs up] Whoops.
You say we're the same, but we get compensated very differently.
Shhh. If we don't listen to the overture, we won't recognize the musical themes when they come back later.
What do you want, baby? We got some granola, got some cupcakes, chips, apples, pies...
I put three pallets on the truck to Blue Cross once a week. They use a lot of paper.
[puts newspaper down] Wow. That dude is good.
You're such a great friend, dot dot dot dot dot.'
Guys, guys. That���s so vague. You gotta do the zip plus four. 1-8-5-0-5 dash 7-4-2-7.
2,184 pounds, for a grand total -- oh! You all gained five pounds back.
Why would you think a lady is me?
[opening door to Deangelo's office] Hey, saw Jim come in.  We meeting?
You come to my house, bust up my trash cans, call my baby sister an ass****, and told her to eat dog food.
We just have a lot of stuff down there that could be stolen.
I couldn't do it. I--- I ain't that strong.  And I ain't that brave.
No... yes, yes. Why wouldn't I... wanna pretend to be gay? Got no problem with that.
Hey, why don't you and me play those?
It's dangerous, Michael. Come on, get off this.
[on cell phone] Fourteen years.  Fourteen.  I know.  [laughing]  Ok, alright.  I gotta go.  Later.  [hangs up]
I don't know... I thought I was enough family for my daughter.
No, it's my plumber. Says so in his bio. Apparently the director discovered him doing karaoke. It's his first play. He didn't even audition.
Nobody told me what people were, alright? So...  label yourselves or take what you get.
Yeah sorry, I'm just looking for a pen.
That's 'cause of you, Mike.  They're not gonna give the workin' man more than the boss.
[exits Andy's office smiling] All I need is Kevin. Dude buys more cookies than everyone combined and then some. [Kevin waves at him] When I first started selling cookies he was a relatively thin man. Not a thin man, mind you. Relatively thin.
I'm gonna tell Jim to go [Bleep] himself.
I meant dressed up compared to normal. You usually dress like a ghost-buster.
Hey Val. Want a beer? It might taste better than that pool water you've been drinking.
Hey, Mike, look. How bout we go upstairs, too. You know learn how the office works. We can all switch places today.
I got Source Code on the way back.
[softly] Pieces of paper. [Jo rolls her eyes]
Well, shall we make it a little interesting?
I asked for a list. [Dwight rides in on a tricycle, laughing diabolically] ...and a clown.
Well, it's simple Mike. I mean we merged these two branches right?  So now we're shipping twice as many orders as we used to.  With Roy gone we got a smaller crew.  And I'm pickin' up all of his slack, so I think I should be compensated fairly, by gettin' a raise.
I was born ready! No, I suck at interviews. I had Andy���s job in the bag until my interview.
[Michael and Holly cautiously pass each other] There's another dolly in the truck, Mike. You could take more than that lamp.
Glen, could you excuse us? [Andy slams the door after Glen leaves, panting heavily]
Woah-Oh! Haven���t been in one of these in forever.
When I worked in the warehouse, I was part of that lotto pool. They won ��� playing my birthday.
I told you we're way past rules. We have been for some time now. We start having rules now, everything we built collapses.
I saw a TLC show on Kate Walsh's home office. All corkboard.
That's sweet Mike. Let's see here. There's a chapter, called Gum. With one sentence. Everybody likes the guy who offers him a stick of gum.
And I fell and busted my ankle.  I'm legitimately scared for my workers.
I didn't have time because of my daughter.
Finish the joke, Andy. What do African Americans call?
Wade said we could do the whole country in three months.
Uh... [looks at camera] yes?! I was. [sits back down] Little joke!
He gets condescending when he's nervous. Or when he's excited or sleepy. Not an easy person to be friends with.
Once you read the packet, sign the back.
[on phone]It���s Darryl. Erin told me to pretend to be a cop and say your mom died.
Mike. Get off of the lift. Please. Come on now.
You don���t have to say it if you���re doing it.
Take it all the way up to your lip, yeah.
Hey, Devil's Den is that way, we should check it out. That's where the snipers hid.
It's like she only wants to hook up when Ryan comes around.  It's gotten to the point where I get excited every time I see that little dude walk through the door.
That's fascinating. Tell me, what's the significance of the peach orchard, thought?
[reading text] Megan Fox. Question mark. What's that mean?
You own a convertible. Come on man that's, that's hot. Women love that stuff right?
I was still thinking of going back to school.
Man, see... That's what I've been sayin', man. We need to do this finally.
Yeah, totally crazy. Puts me in an insane asylum just thinking about it. I'm stranded on shutter island over here.
Yeah, but then they moved the panel to the same weekend and the Doc crew paid to fly us in. It was kismet.
[to Kevin] What's a skinny guy like Toby know about cookies? You can't trust him to understand the wants and needs of the thick man. Maybe Toby from two years ago.
Nope. I'm good. I'm here. Let's find some warehouse workers.
Look, I'm not down there anymore, so if the guys start making fun of you, you just, you gotta stand up for yourself.
Ten people, Michael. Ten people.  Would you like to be one of them?
Yeah, just weekends for now, but pretty soon, I���m switching over.
They left you in the lurch, and if they want to jump in, it means you're almost there. You did this. Bring it home.
Thank you. [Kevin grabs cookie and starts eating it]
No, wait. You're, you're supposed to... Never mind. Da  na na na na.
I taught Mike some, uh, phrases to help with his interracial conversations. You know, stuff like, 'Fleece it out.' 'Going mach five.' 'Dinkin' flicka.' You know, things us Negroes say.
Hey. Hey, look, when you get done with your... [looks inside conference room] meeting, you should, uh, come to the break room. We're having a party.
I wanted to leave quietly. It seemed dignified. But having Kevin grind up on my front while Erin pretends to hump me from behind is a more accurate tribute to my years here. I���m gonna miss these guys.
We are hanging out-right now. You want some more of this?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. Okay, I made the mistake of sneaking out of here and that���s on me. But I���m not gonna spend the rest of the day here doing stuff with you cause you���re feeling sentimental.
You know what you guys should do? Go to the bookstore at lunch. There's tons of cuties and it's easy to talk to them. 'Hey, what book is that? Cool, let's hang out tonight. Sex already? Whoa...'
Me and Val were going nowhere and if I'm gonna be working in Philly, I'm gonna need my freedom. So, I convinced Val to breakup with me. Here's how you do it. You say, 'What are you gonna do, breakup with me?' Like it's a joke, and then you gain a lot of weight.
How far is this place? [turns off radio]
[Dwight and Jim enter office] Hey, hey. They're back. [Everyone greets them]
Say stuff like, 'Good morning, Good Afternoon'. People appreciate that.
Yes! [to video screen]  Right here. You are a naughty girl!
[Jim puts popcorn bag in microwave] Hey, if you don't want to teach me Power Point, just say so.
Her.  Yes, 'her' is qualified to work a dangerous machine.  You are not.  Okay?
Didn't have to see. It was sales. I can feel it. They are out of control.
I brought those in. It's my birthday.  That's some stone-cold narcissism right there.
Andy, it���s Darryl. Take your drawers off your head.
Because you're not a daddy, and it's not your baby.
Yeah, but I never said you had nothing to live for.
Oh, Mi... ! Hey, stop the video! Michael, stop it right there! Stop it right there! That's that girl from that thing. [pointing at Redheaded Actress] I banged this girl right here. This is...
Come on, stay, alright? It's good for people to get to know you.
It's getting late. I thought you guys could use a little [sets up laptop] inspiration.
Everyday when I came into work, all I wanted to do was leave. So why in the world does it feel so hard to leave right now?
Hey!  How about instead of yelling at our sweet little Miss Kapoor over five hundred sheets of paper you get back to your desk.  Start sellin' multiple reams like a man.
OK, um, I like Erin's hair. It's a very pretty color.
If we were living in Sweden, I wouldn't have to worry about this 'cause we'd have universal healthcare.
[Talks drunk angry] Jim, that guy. [Scoffs] You gotta stick to your word! Like when you say something to a buddy, a real buddy...what are you gonna do, lie? To your buddy? [Sighs] It's awful.
Mike, I am not having fire-eaters in a paper warehouse.
Delivered all my furniture to Philly. Hey, keep it down, though. Nobody knows I���m here.
Jada don't want to spend Christmas with me. She told her mom it wasn't as much fun. And how could she say that? You know, I took her to the toy store to buy her own presents.
[as Cookie Monster] Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum.
I have a solid relationship with Jo, the company's owner. I have management experience. I have a good friendship with Jim, the head of the Search Committee, and it doesn't hurt that I'm... [in Oprah-like sing-song voice] bla-aaack!
It's cool that you like the southwest. It's one of my favorite regions.
If you say so. Hey, good seeing you. Remember, I was never here. All right, then.
I got my whole life to be a minority executive. I only have about a year left in these knees, though.
There's information here? Yeah, you're right, I don't need this.
Come on, Dwight, stop overreacting. I���m getting all my work done here. No customers have complained. Nobody even knows.
Hell yeah.  You know why?  Because that was my baby.
Mike, this is the opposite of safety.  You jump, you're gonna serious hurt yourself.
It's not a trash compactor!  It's a baler!
And you got half a million of these? Well I gotta try it.
This doesn't help me. I don't respond to that kind of strategy.
I need you to sign these, we got a shipment going out.
[noticing Erin in the background leading a black man dressed in a suit through the office] Who's that?
Look, I heard about the office. Tough break.
Spot a cow, last person to say 'Jackson Five' has to get on its back and ride it.
This may be wrong. But there's a limit to what I would do for my child.
[leaving someone a message on his cell phone, looking very uncomfortable] Hey what's up, I just thought I'd try you. I was thinking about that story where you ran into the girl you used to babysit.
You should talk in a higher voice 'cause the camera makes you sound weird.
Yeah, when are they gonna do a Labradoodle that's just Lab?
My future's not gonna be determined by seven little white lotto balls. It's gonna be determined by two big black balls. I control my destiny. I do.
What? Wait, wait, wait? So what? This happening?
[makes sudden sharp turn to the left, causing DVD player to fall out open window, then grins to camera]
���Mandate���- Always think of two men on a date. [awkward moment] I have gay friends��� I have one gay friend. [to Jim] Oscar?
Let me get this straight. You lost all of it. All your winnings. A hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
And I'm telling them you guys sexually harassed my sister.
I'm just glad we're gonna try it out.
Everyone, we have a voluntary meeting in the conference room to discuss Erin's confidence.
���This coupon entitles you to one free tickle monster attack���
Back at the bus.  We were locked out.  Phyllis is sitting on the ground eating a dirty sandwich.
I'm done. I gotta get out of here.
I love the desert. It's one of my favorite ecosystems.
No? OK. I don't wanna be here anymore. Fire me.
That stuff can come back to get you. It���s called karma. You do not want to be messing around. I got an uncle���
If you don't enter them immediately, you forget. What?
You hired your actor friend to come here as a cop?
Darryl Philbin. Then Regis, then Rege, then Roger, then Mister Rogers.
[fake whispers to Roy] I think he feels bad.
That thing were you softly exhale on her neck.
You just threw a milkshake in a restaurant where they make minimum wage.
Michael, you know you don't have to turn us all in. All you need is one scapegoat.
Oh, I'm sorry Mike, some of my folks got to hear about this one.  [texting on cell phone] Ah. [laughs]
[talking head] I'm driving them up for five times what I would've made at work. I thought I made a good deal. [expression changes from smiling to downcast] Then I realized I'm gonna be trapped in a truck with Mike all day.
Yes, I am. Just so everyone's on the same page.
[as Jim empties thermos into trash] Nah, nah, nah. You don't have to do that.
Nice. Do the damn thing. - Pow! [they fist bump and explode]
Better get some decent speakers up here then, cause we���re gonna do this right.
I'll come with you, show you how it's done.
Whoa! That person has really gotten him or herself into quite a predicament.
I'm telling you, don't do it. I've got nothing against strip clubs, but I do have something against them at noon on a Monday. The day shift at a strip club? You can't unsee that.
You're new to the game. You learned a lesson today. See you next year, sport.
Let me tell you something, Oscar. All right, Matt's an okay dude, but he's a dummy. You guys got nothing in common.
Nothing stupid about working for yourself. Hanging out with pro athletes, getting free tickets to the games. That���s why I���m doing it.
Her mom wants me to take her to mass. I guess that's something to do.
Look, Andy, even if your ancestors did own slaves, it wouldn't be your fault. This is only weird if you make it weird.
These are very dangerous machines down here, and the upstairs workers,
Yeah, yeah me too. I think it���d be like��� You know what? [grabs basketball] I think it���d be like a Kevin Durant jump shot��� Perfecto! [shoots basketball at hoop on wall, basketball misses and lands in fish tank, killing the fish] Oh my god���
Ahh���We don't really do those. We just sign the thing.
Two years ago, Andy blamed the warehouse for a late shipment that he forgot to process. We got yelled at pretty bad. Almost lost my job, and I was mad as hell at the time. But I said 'Darryl, just wait. He's a fool. There's gonna be an opportunity. Just be patient.' [smiles]
This seems like the kind of thing white people with dreadlocks do.
I feel good today. My little girl Jada? It's my turn to have her for Christmas this year. Two years ago I had her, and we had the best time. I tivoed her favorite shows, some things I've never heard of. iCarly... You know who's funny on that show? The friend with the video camera. He's got a nice way of talking.
My resolution is to read more. And if someone else is driving me to the bookstore, I can eat my PB&J in the car. 2011 is coming up all Darryl.
Are you wearin' lady clothes?  Those look like lady... pants.
[looks to camera for several seconds] At least it's quiet.
I just did, like, 35 minutes on the treadmill.
Mike claims, we're all a family isn't that right?
Alright, we're going down to my warehouse, that means we're playing by my rules. No messing with the baler and be cool in front of me and Val. We just broke up.
Take it out. Pick it up. Pick it up. Pick it up. Take it out.
Look you need to pick yourself up. Man up, alright? You will win this in the end. It's all about heart, and character. Be your best self.
I have a file of applicants here. I just gotta open it, look at it, interview a bunch of guys,hire some of 'em. So I'd say we're in the early stages of the process.
Wow. Man. I hope he doesn���t regret it.
Hey, look, Pennsylvania license plate! That's crazy! All the way out here! Who can name all the states?
I'll answer that, Jim. I would use it as an opportunity to teach, uh, about actions... and consequences... of actions. [Jim and Gabe stare at Darryl]
Well you lost zero pounds. [everyone grumbles]  No change.  On the bright side you gained zero pounds.
I usually watch TV during my lunch breaks. It's cool?
I love Jim. I love that he hooked me up with a job. It's just, he uses old t-shirts as wash rags. He doesn't wash his dishes. Apparently, they need to [quote-unquote fingers] soak... He hooked me up with a job.
[claps] That was great man. Alright, I'm out of here.
I hope so. Think about this carefully. There's better lives than this one.
[Kevin scratches cookie order form and sniffs it] It's not a scratch-and-sniff, Kev.
One of 'em, Glenn, is starting one of those fat camps where he steals your kid in the middle of the night. Madge and a couple other guys might start a strip club, but on a boat. And Heday is investing in an energy drink for Asian homosexuals. [Andy laughs awkwardly]
[Comes up behind Jim and puts his hands on Jim's shoulders] Ah-Ha-Ha! Philly! Exciting stuff, man.
That's big of you, man. Takes a lot of courage.
The baler can flatten a car engine.  It can cut off your arm and crush your entire body without skipping a beat.
Maybe the grinch hid the Christmas star, and we could ask for clues, and he'll tell us if we're hot or cold.
[bluesy] Da na na na na...  da na na na  na...
[singing in different tune] Out of paper, out of stock, there's friendly faces around the block, break loose from the chains that are causing your pain. Call Michael, Stanley, Jim, Dwight or Creed. Call Andy and Kelly for your business paper needs. Call Dunder Mifflin.
Thank God we only had a baler to deal with.
Already on it. I ordered them by their Google trend ranking so we know who to hit first.
Usually that life is short and tragic. That's okay, right?
Mr. Romanko, we were a day late on one of your deliveries, but two of our trucks were down for repairs. It���s very unlikely it would happen again.
Yeah, I did. I, I was talking to this girl at a bar.
Oh, come on, man. I thought you had something real.
A lot... of things.  Uh, you, uh... What about Jan?  Lovely, lovely, lovely Jan, man.  It's goin' good, right?
No, you don't. You don't feel us. How can you? You know what?
Oh my God, I think I see the imprint of a ring pop.
How would you like it if we booed you?
I did. I did have a fantastic basement. Now it smells like tacos. You can't air out a basement and taco air is heavy. Settles at the lowest point.
Oh, yeah, I need McMahon, Deion Branch to have big games or else I'm done.
Uh... I have other issues. I'm terrible at math. Overweight. You- you're in great shape. A lot better shape than I am, tell you what.
Yeah, I'll say something. I think we should be acknowledging our boss, because none of us would be here without him. Robert California! [everyone toasts]
Oh, this is a gift, for....my man Nate here.
She said her name was Brandon, I think. Your mom's name is Brandon?
[in a feminine voice] Hi. This is Alex.
Since Andy promoted me to assistant regional manager, I've been trying to step my game up, you know, be more productive. In fact, you know what? Let���s knock out a few more of these sound bites while we're here. [pauses] Whoa! That person has really gotten him or herself into quite a predicament.
These dudes are definitely in a weird mood. Picked the wrong day to return a truck.
We did it! Hey, and look, the buyers wanna make sure it���s not just a Philly play, so get this: they���re gonna pay for us to go pitch out west. We talking Spurs, the Jazz, Cowboys. Blake Griffin, baby.
Yeah, I'm gonna ask questions and I might not do what you say.
Actually, Val, why don't you come with? I'll need the extra hands to carry them back.
All right, fine, you know what? One o'clock.
It was kind of mumbled, I don't know, uh, only thing I could make out clearly was 'Andy,' 'Problem,' 'Eliminate,' something. I don't know what it meant.
Would it be more hilarious than Angela having a Chinese baby?
Hey, hey, hey. I���ll do one thing with y���all.
Actually, Bob Vance bought out the warehouse. So he's keeping on the whole crew. So, we good.
We work the same hours as you and you just said we work a lot harder
And did your brains tell you to ruin these boxes with grease?
[interrupting] Stop talking 'bout it. I said I'm fine with it.
You know, I just got Limitless on my iPad. I bet I could get it on the TV.
[on phone] Yes, there used to be a paper clip that would pop up and say 'Looks like you are writing a letter or resume. Would you like help? I believe his name was... [looks embarrassed at camera] Clippy.
Nope. His name is Michael. [Michael makes the da dum ksch on the drumset again]
Ohh, that sounds fun and Christmasy, you mean old grinch!
What you say, bitch? You know, you might be right.
I think if I had parents like that I'd be trying to convince everyone all the time how great I was, too.
I don't know. You gonna wash it? Or you gonna let it soak?
[taking photo with Jada] Let's see that smile. Go on. [waves to Val]
Okay, I'm gonna need you to make this right or else we can't be right.
Baby, if you���re watching this, you're not chubby, you're beautiful. Daddy's just got to sell some cookies. And we're also gonna exercise more. It's gonna be fun.
Man, you have got to be kidding me.
You know what, you're one bad text away from getting blocked.
Man, we can see all your business coming around the corner, okay? You need to, you know, hide the... good thing you don't have a lot of business to start with.
It's more than necessary, Mike. We need this. Roy? You still have that card from the Dockworker's Union?
[scores] Here we go. Here we go. Here we go.
You got it. Pick it up. Take it out.
I think she could... sense my sadness, and I, and I found out too late that she... she's the copy editor at the Trib.
That's what I've been trying to tell you, Mike.  It's serious down there.  We do dangerous stuff, man.  This is shenanigans, foolishness, Nerf-ball.  You live a sweet, little, Nerf-y life.  Sittin' on your biscuit.  Never havin' to risk it.
This is the spookiest warehouse in the world, kids. You don't believe me? Just take a look. [Kevin chops into Erin, who is dressed as Princess Fiona] Oh. Scary, huh? This is a surgery with an octopus and a burn victim.
Oh, it works. Him and me, all right, we are crazy in love. More love than your small mind can comprehend. And we have two disposable incomes. And no kids. And we're taking our business elsewhere. [Oscar and Darryl exit holding hands]
Mike, I'm very busy down here. [eats chicken]
I was there. That dude is not engaged. I'm not a big believer in therapy, but I'll go into my own pocket to cover his co-pay.
Yeah, I heard. It sounds kinda lame. [to camera] No offense. You going, Toby?
The man is paying me to take Chinese.  I will say what I need to say, and soon, I will say it in Chinese.
I just think you���re going into this a little fast.
I'll do it better than you. I earned it. I deserve it. I got passed over, God knows why, reasons I cannot and will not understand. The job was mine Andy, everyone said it was mine. Make me manager or fire me.
It's not just today, it's everyday. It seems like the better title I have, the stupider my job gets.
What? Is he retiring? You getting him a gift or something?
I'm sure they don't regret having their child, let's move it to the pros.
I have a kid. Last week, Jim at home? That was no vacation.
I don't know, man. Y'all quit with a lot of confidence. I mean, it was like, y'all came up in here dancing and everybody was- [sees Val] ooh, hold on a second. [sees Brandon] Oh.
Check out this song I wrote: I'ma love you downstairs tonight... [overlapping chatter]
I haven't been to New York in a long time.
The guy who was in here earlier, interviewed after me, how'd he do?
Hey... [sighs] You know what, I could use a breath of fresh air. Let's do it.
[plays soft chords and sings]  Couldn't get outta bed today. Wish the alarm clock would go away.
It���s 30 degrees out. You drinkin��� a mildshake?
Why don���t you come along and tell him yourself?
So you sure you remembered everything for your trip?
Jim is happy here, selling paper at Dunder Mifflin?
[in a dress shirt and tie] Like what?
Oh you could stay too.  He's got a big place.
Actually, Andy, we call this one Dwight, Jr.
Come on, Mike, let me borrow the hat for just a couple of hours.
We do safety training every year, or after an accident. ... We've never made it a full year.  This particular time, I was reaching for a supply box on the top shelf, when one office worker, who shall remain nameless, kicked the ladder out from under me and yelled...
[on the phone] I just, no, she be talking to your mom or something. This is my daughter too, Justine! You seem to think, [Justine hangs up] oh... pick a damn tree already.
[entering Andy's office] Hey, man. Selling cookies for Jada. Want the same as last year?
[in a feminine voice] Kevin can't come to the phone right now because he's busy with us.
Which usually means there's clothes all over the living room.
No! No no no no no!  I said
Hey! He deserves this. And he said I could get in on it too.  [whispers] Yeah.
I had no idea. This plumber has pipes!
You just made a good idea, a great idea.
Local musician? Local legend! I used to come hear you play every week at the Deerhead.
Andy Bernard can't squirt water in his eye and act like it doesn't freak him out. But you know who can? Older Male Lab Assistant Number One.
Somebody just needs to get her attention, tell her it's not OK to do this in public.
Sucks. Anyway, I just don't see it. The Knicks are tough.The Nets are tough.
Oh, no. I mean, I want to, I just...I don't want to force you into something you don't want to do.
This is not a good idea right here.
[freezes] Ummm��� [a moment later] Alright. Obviously y���all look really busy, and uh, I don���t want to waste your time anymore. Sorry, I just uhh��� Obviously I���m not qualified to be here man, I���m���  I���m a warehouse manager, you know���
I would if I owned it and I went broke.
Pepper's been getting me out of the house, going on runs.
Oh, it's nice, it's real nice. People get dressed up.
You're not as scary as Book Face, over there.
Dwight, look, I���m sorry you���re having a hard time with this, okay? Athlead is my future. No disrespect to Dunder Mifflin, but if I can have fun at work, I want that.
No, that's uh. Porn. Pornography. Old lady... nasty... porn.
Mike gave me a list of his top ten Springsteen songs. Three of them were Huey Lewis and the News. One was Tracy Chapman, Fast Car. And my personal favorite, Short People.
What'd I tell you about building forts in my warehouse?
Hey I'm not gonna tell you this stuff if you gonna throw it back in my face.
[enters the office with his daughter, who runs in and hugs Jim] Jada, no, no, no, Jada, what are you doing? [Jim looks knowingly at the camera] Oh. So sorry, guys. I hope my family didn't disrupt your meeting.
Why don't we make it more interesting? Loser buys dinner at Farley's.
Hey, you know what would be fun? Like, sleeping.
You mean to tell me no one wanted an energy drink for Asian homosexuals?
A car parked in the sun is like a toaster oven.
You're right, it's better than you! It's us! [sings] Dunder Mifflin.
[To himself] Back for more, huh? [Gets up and walks towards Jim]
I've never been lucky. And I'm not talkin' about the lottery, I'm talkin' 'bout stuff like developing a soy allergy at thirty-five. Who gets a soy allergy at thirty-five? And why is soy in everything?
We're the ones that got to clean that up!
[reads text] Come to parking lot. Crazy pigeon action?
Andy made me his consigliere. Which means Assistant Regional Manager. I guess he thought I'd be into The Godfather 'cause I'm black. Wrong! I'm into The Godfather 'cause I'm a cinephile. I like Scarface 'cause I'm black.
Now, this is the forklift.  You need--- [Michael rattles it] You need a license to operate this machine.  That means the upstairs office workers
You know what? It's your first time, let's split the office. You can have sales, the annex, Creed, and I don't know I'll just take, uh, accounting.
It's all about finding ways to make yourself more efficient. Life hacking, baby. This morning, I brushed my teeth in the shower. Saved my self 90 seconds. Which I just used to explain this to you. Damn it!
I don't wanna prank anymore. Things get real. It's not funny. I'm just gonna be good, stay in my room, go to church, try to do one nice thing per day. I do not wanna prank anymore.
So, uh... here you go. [gives resume to Jim]
Mmm-hmm. [thumping] [Roy groaning] Now you've got to drink.
A restful location. Talk to Glen. He'll take you up in the lift.
He's not my hire, but I know who he is.
You feel connected to this? [hold up his back brace]
So if I started singing ���Down By the Old Mill Stream���, you couldn't join me in a three part harmony. [Andy and Officer Foley shake their heads no, Darryl begins singing] Down by the, down by the, down by the....
Here is an old man and a goth dude... and then the old crone from Drag Me to Hell.
You've got a booger bubble going on there.
Yes, thanks to you, who promoted me, after we, uh, interfaced.
I don't know who's got you upset but my advice is stop crying.
A lot has changed since y'all left, okay? You're gonna have to jump through some hoops. And the new foreman is here. Now she's one of the best we've ever known, okay? So I need you to show her your upmost respect. Make sure she feels welcome and at home, okay? Can you do that?
Yeah that's true.  You gotta call your girl, and get paid.  Show her who wears the pants in the relationship.
It's one of my favorite regions? Did I just sound totally lame? No, I sounded good.
Still good. You guys lost a pound. You lost one pound.
Well you should definitely come. The foreman always comes. Plus it's fun, you know cookies, smoked fish, alcohol, people acting stupid.
I didn't hire anyone if that's why you're here.
Yeah. Yeah, it���s hot. The music is awesome. And the tacos are���for real.
Nothing. [pulls out a can of soda] It's mine. [Jim shakes his head] [after looking through DVR] What happened to my Tavis Smileys?
Higher. [motions with hand to go up more]
Man, you can't do that stuff. You'll only find pain. When my ex-wife got into my e-mail account, she was devastated.
No, no, Jim. This is different. This is everything.
We livin��� like rock stars. I���m about to eat free steaks with my sports heroes in 32 different cities.
Yeah them, and the Latin Kings... the Warriors...
That sounds fun, mucking around in the dump. Wish I could go.
Looked like it. Sometimes when I'm down like this, it helps to sing the blues.
Show business is cold. Let���s say you get a job, which you probably won���t. They���re not gonna cut you any slack. You���re meant for a job with lots and lots of slack.
I don't know, man, they might think we're drag queens.
It's Dallas the game, we can figure it out.
Come on man. I'm being serious. Don't joke.
Look, I need this. Ok? Your daughter is a pretty little girl. Let her go door-to-door. You think people gonna buy cookies from my [hesitates] chubby daughter?
Well, yeah, what can I say, a player���s gotta play.
The guys did invite me out to celebrate but I decided to just stay home. Eat a bunch of tacos in my basement.
It's not real... until your wife is on board.
Everybody knows I go to Philly. I've just been using sick days I saved up. But, Erin was so excited about being sneaky-sneaks, I went along with it.
Then you gotta have muscles, man. You got some muscles? Let's see.
