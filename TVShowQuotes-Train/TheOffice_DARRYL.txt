You mean what did we do the last time the warehouse won the lottery?
Hey, look, Pennsylvania license plate! That's crazy! All the way out here! Who can name all the states?
[To himself] Back for more, huh? [Gets up and walks towards Jim]
It's Dallas the game, we can figure it out.
It's one of my favorite regions? Did I just sound totally lame? No, I sounded good.
[to Val] You know, I don't think I've ever been in this exact angle before. I was scared at first, but I like it.
No. Thank you for your interest in my truck.
Aw, come on. What's the harm? [makes face] Mmm. What flavor was that?
Nah man, we get along now.  Real well.
Mike, I'm very busy down here. [eats chicken]
[as Jim empties thermos into trash] Nah, nah, nah. You don't have to do that.
Jim is happy here, selling paper at Dunder Mifflin?
Yes. I do remember saying something like that to you.
You need to change your standard for what's worthy of a text. Ask yourself is this something Darryl needs to know. The answers almost always no.
If I were Val, I would break up with Brandon. Then I would date the hell out of me. I wouldn't give in to me too fast, let me buy myself some nice dinners and such. But when I finally did give in, I would go crazy on myself.
Dwight, look, I���m sorry you���re having a hard time with this, okay? Athlead is my future. No disrespect to Dunder Mifflin, but if I can have fun at work, I want that.
Follow me, I got a space. After you.  I���ve been thinking about you all mornin���.  I don���t know what you did, I can barely walk today.
You mean to tell me no one wanted an energy drink for Asian homosexuals?
Yes. All of 'em. Together. It's a conspiracy. Listen to me, Mike, you gotta do something about them.
There were times on the two and a half hour drive when I experienced doubt. That's the thing about long drives, you know, you're always going to- this is a gay bar.
It was kind of mumbled, I don't know, uh, only thing I could make out clearly was 'Andy,' 'Problem,' 'Eliminate,' something. I don't know what it meant.
Mike, you can't do that. It's conflict of interest.
We just have a lot of stuff down there that could be stolen.
Mike, why do you have to control how he perceives it in his mind?
All right, I'm being a jerk. You got me this job. I should be grateful. I am, I just... you know, I get finicky about my stuff. That's all.
Well, when they merged the two branches together, they put
Sometimes it seems like it was better down in the warehouse, you know?
Everyone, we have a voluntary meeting in the conference room to discuss Erin's confidence.
Whoa! That person has really gotten him or herself into quite a predicament.
A car parked in the sun is like a toaster oven.
My resolution is to read more. And if someone else is driving me to the bookstore, I can eat my PB&J in the car. 2011 is coming up all Darryl.
[in a feminine voice] Hi. This is Alex.
The man is paying me to take Chinese.  I will say what I need to say, and soon, I will say it in Chinese.
It does not say dangerous. And there's no exclamation point.
I like the sound of that. Is Kevin in?
Yes! [to video screen]  Right here. You are a naughty girl!
Delivered all my furniture to Philly. Hey, keep it down, though. Nobody knows I���m here.
[puts newspaper down] Wow. That dude is good.
No... yes, yes. Why wouldn't I... wanna pretend to be gay? Got no problem with that.
No, that's not a good idea. I don't see that as a very good song.
Well you lost zero pounds. [everyone grumbles]  No change.  On the bright side you gained zero pounds.
That's 'cause of you, Mike.  They're not gonna give the workin' man more than the boss.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. For sure. For sure. for sure. Man!  And Pam's into it?
Yeah, we had a few fights, I suppose.  But last night we put a lot of that to bed.  I can���t tell you what I did with my ex wife last night���. I have to sing it.  [singing] We took a shower, we were naked. We ska dap dap doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.
I was in The Whiz in high school.
[as Cookie Monster] Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum.
Would it be more hilarious than Angela having a Chinese baby?
We do safety training every year, or after an accident. ... We've never made it a full year.  This particular time, I was reaching for a supply box on the top shelf, when one office worker, who shall remain nameless, kicked the ladder out from under me and yelled...
I love Jim. I love that he hooked me up with a job. It's just, he uses old t-shirts as wash rags. He doesn't wash his dishes. Apparently, they need to [quote-unquote fingers] soak... He hooked me up with a job.
[driving truck] Hey, y'all are not gonna be playing these little private games all the way.
[On phone] Hello?....Justine! [laughs] Nice surprise! How you doin' baby?....Nah. No no, I didn't win. When I got promoted I stop-...what?...Yeah. Yeah, Glenn won....Oh, you wanna call him? Yeah, you should call him, congratulate him. That'll be-...What?....Oh, his number's in your old phone. Oh, you know what? I might have it right- [hangs up] Whoops.
Take it all the way up to your lip, yeah.
Oh, in the warehouse we use code names for people we want to talk about. Andy was Jelly Roll. Mike was Dennis the Menace. Ryan was douche bag.
You say we're the same, but we get compensated very differently.
[Kevin scratches cookie order form and sniffs it] It's not a scratch-and-sniff, Kev.
I'm telling you how to do this man.
[Pam knocks on Darryl's door] Don't come in, I'm busy. [Pam opens the door]
Then you gotta have muscles, man. You got some muscles? Let's see.
Well you should definitely come. The foreman always comes. Plus it's fun, you know cookies, smoked fish, alcohol, people acting stupid.
I don't know. You gonna wash it? Or you gonna let it soak?
[to Kevin] What's a skinny guy like Toby know about cookies? You can't trust him to understand the wants and needs of the thick man. Maybe Toby from two years ago.
[Dwight heads toward a strip club] Oh, no, no, no. Uh-uh.
Oh, it works. Him and me, all right, we are crazy in love. More love than your small mind can comprehend. And we have two disposable incomes. And no kids. And we're taking our business elsewhere. [Oscar and Darryl exit holding hands]
I wanted to leave quietly. It seemed dignified. But having Kevin grind up on my front while Erin pretends to hump me from behind is a more accurate tribute to my years here. I���m gonna miss these guys.
Nobody told me what people were, alright? So...  label yourselves or take what you get.
It's not safe, you don't have a license.
It's cool that you like the southwest. It's one of my favorite regions.
I been selling here for five years. This is my spot.
What you say, bitch? You know, you might be right.
Don't just take the first job that comes your way. Cause next thing you know, it's ten years later and you���re still there. Could write your obituary tomorrow, it's not gonna change.
[Dwight and Jim enter office] Hey, hey. They're back. [Everyone greets them]
Well, yeah, what can I say, a player���s gotta play.
These are very dangerous machines down here, and the upstairs workers,
Mike, I am not having fire-eaters in a paper warehouse.
Yeah, I did. I, I was talking to this girl at a bar.
They left you in the lurch, and if they want to jump in, it means you're almost there. You did this. Bring it home.
That's when you hit me with what's getting you down, okay?
Hey!  How about instead of yelling at our sweet little Miss Kapoor over five hundred sheets of paper you get back to your desk.  Start sellin' multiple reams like a man.
Two years ago, Andy blamed the warehouse for a late shipment that he forgot to process. We got yelled at pretty bad. Almost lost my job, and I was mad as hell at the time. But I said 'Darryl, just wait. He's a fool. There's gonna be an opportunity. Just be patient.' [smiles]
[noticing all the warehouse workers wearing homemade beanies] Wow. It's like the nation of Islam down here.
You're not as scary as Book Face, over there.
There's information here? Yeah, you're right, I don't need this.
I'll answer that, Jim. I would use it as an opportunity to teach, uh, about actions... and consequences... of actions. [Jim and Gabe stare at Darryl]
How many people a year do you think get their arms cut off in a baler?
Okay, can you just stand right there?  [snaps camera phone picture] I gotta send some e-mails.
Now, this is the forklift.  You need--- [Michael rattles it] You need a license to operate this machine.  That means the upstairs office workers
I've been working out. But, the problem is, I've been building muscle underneath. And that top layer hasn't burned off yet. Awkward stage.
Damn! Jim, you got a real Facebook energy going on here man. You Zuckerberged this place out!
Let me tell you something, Oscar. All right, Matt's an okay dude, but he's a dummy. You guys got nothing in common.
I think if I had parents like that I'd be trying to convince everyone all the time how great I was, too.
I put some guys on tonight. Best of your bunch and my bunch. Tell you now though, it's gonna be mostly my bunch.
Kill their fish, and they still hire me. That���s how you do that, baby. It���s all good, I���m ready. Y���all ready for this? [sings intro to ���Everybody dance now���, points to Pam to sing first line]
Yes sir.  Remember that.  I'll be right outside if you need me
Tracee Ellis Ross. Daughter of the First Lady of Motown, Diana Ross.
[singing in different tune] Out of paper, out of stock, there's friendly faces around the block, break loose from the chains that are causing your pain. Call Michael, Stanley, Jim, Dwight or Creed. Call Andy and Kelly for your business paper needs. Call Dunder Mifflin.
[approaches Kevin] Would you like to buy some cookies?
We did it! Hey, and look, the buyers wanna make sure it���s not just a Philly play, so get this: they���re gonna pay for us to go pitch out west. We talking Spurs, the Jazz, Cowboys. Blake Griffin, baby.
Oh, it's nice, it's real nice. People get dressed up.
We're the ones that got to clean that up!
Yeah, but I never said you had nothing to live for.
Look you need to pick yourself up. Man up, alright? You will win this in the end. It's all about heart, and character. Be your best self.
No, no, I���m not here actually. These donuts are part of my escape from the guys at the warehouse I didn���t say goodbye to.
Nope. His name is Michael. [Michael makes the da dum ksch on the drumset again]
[Talks drunk angry] Jim, that guy. [Scoffs] You gotta stick to your word! Like when you say something to a buddy, a real buddy...what are you gonna do, lie? To your buddy? [Sighs] It's awful.
I have a kid. Last week, Jim at home? That was no vacation.
Well see, um... in the gang world, we use something called Fluffy Fingers.
[claps] That was great man. Alright, I'm out of here.
[bluesy] Da na na na na...  da na na na  na...
I did. I did have a fantastic basement. Now it smells like tacos. You can't air out a basement and taco air is heavy. Settles at the lowest point.
So this is cool. I think we make a good fit. [stands up]
You're such a great friend, dot dot dot dot dot.'
Oh, this is a gift, for....my man Nate here.
You have one more free throw shoot. Come on.
Oh my God, I think I see the imprint of a ring pop.
Man, see... That's what I've been sayin', man. We need to do this finally.
Actually, Bob Vance bought out the warehouse. So he's keeping on the whole crew. So, we good.
I was still thinking of going back to school.
I don���t care, choose amongst yourselves. Not the van though.
[taking photo with Jada] Let's see that smile. Go on. [waves to Val]
[softly] Pieces of paper. [Jo rolls her eyes]
Say stuff like, 'Good morning, Good Afternoon'. People appreciate that.
Wow. Man. I hope he doesn���t regret it.
Michael, you know you don't have to turn us all in. All you need is one scapegoat.
So if I started singing ���Down By the Old Mill Stream���, you couldn't join me in a three part harmony. [Andy and Officer Foley shake their heads no, Darryl begins singing] Down by the, down by the, down by the....
No, it's my plumber. Says so in his bio. Apparently the director discovered him doing karaoke. It's his first play. He didn't even audition.
Me and Val were going nowhere and if I'm gonna be working in Philly, I'm gonna need my freedom. So, I convinced Val to breakup with me. Here's how you do it. You say, 'What are you gonna do, breakup with me?' Like it's a joke, and then you gain a lot of weight.
Mike, we're not shipping as much as we did last year.
No, wait. You're, you're supposed to... Never mind. Da  na na na na.
Yeah, totally crazy. Puts me in an insane asylum just thinking about it. I'm stranded on shutter island over here.
Come on, Mike, let me borrow the hat for just a couple of hours.
Mike claims, we're all a family isn't that right?
Hey, um, my daughter said you traded her a headband for her Nintendo DS?
Come on, stay, alright? It's good for people to get to know you.
My summer, I, um, blew out my knee playing softball. Ended up watching CNN most of the time. I don't know how we're going to get out of Afghanistan. I hate the new assistant. He's only been here for a week, and I hate him.
Yeah, I heard. It sounds kinda lame. [to camera] No offense. You going, Toby?
Take it out. Pick it up. Pick it up. Pick it up. Take it out.
Yeah, I'll say something. I think we should be acknowledging our boss, because none of us would be here without him. Robert California! [everyone toasts]
Which usually means there's clothes all over the living room.
I can���t really picture it. Can you... get it on there. Yeah. And maybe, get the cheeks.
Yeah, I'm gonna ask questions and I might not do what you say.
What do you want, baby? We got some granola, got some cupcakes, chips, apples, pies...
I taught Mike some, uh, phrases to help with his interracial conversations. You know, stuff like, 'Fleece it out.' 'Going mach five.' 'Dinkin' flicka.' You know, things us Negroes say.
[to Val] Hey, you caught some of that?
Well, [points at Michael] those are some awful tight pants you have on. Where'd you get em? Like Queers R Us?
Mike. Get off of the lift. Please. Come on now.
[reading text] Megan Fox. Question mark. What's that mean?
This seems like the kind of thing white people with dreadlocks do.
Why don't we make it more interesting? Loser buys dinner at Farley's.
[singing] Out of paper, out of stock, there's friendly faces around the block, break loose from the chains that are causing your pain.
I'll come with you, show you how it's done.
Why would you think a lady is me?
Hey, man, you put together a pretty fun night for everybody. I saw you talking to Hide. Did you hear that dude's life story? It's amazing, right?
You know what you guys should do? Go to the bookstore at lunch. There's tons of cuties and it's easy to talk to them. 'Hey, what book is that? Cool, let's hang out tonight. Sex already? Whoa...'
You're new to the game. You learned a lesson today. See you next year, sport.
[fake whispers to Roy] I think he feels bad.
No? OK. I don't wanna be here anymore. Fire me.
I just don't get it, Pam. I mean, you're a rational person.
Yeah they kind of had a specific sound that didn't really fit in with our thing.
OK, everybody smile. Ho! You lost 31 pounds.
Hey. While I got you on the phone, your husband's like a sloppy, homeless hobo. Can you fix that?
[looks to camera for several seconds] At least it's quiet.
What'd I tell you about building forts in my warehouse?
Yeah, I wanted the manager job, but I got somethin��� much better. This soda. This is mine.
Get your own raise.  You gotta get out there and earn, son.
[scores] Here we go. Here we go. Here we go.
It's getting late. I thought you guys could use a little [sets up laptop] inspiration.
I got my whole life to be a minority executive. I only have about a year left in these knees, though.
You crushed our spirits, Gabe. Congrats. You're a big man, huh? Take a lot to destroy the creativity of a whole group of people. [notification tone] [laughter]
[noticing Erin in the background leading a black man dressed in a suit through the office] Who's that?
[on the phone] I just, no, she be talking to your mom or something. This is my daughter too, Justine! You seem to think, [Justine hangs up] oh... pick a damn tree already.
I love it. And it���s Athleap now. And the city is amazing.
All right so the support belt. Now this one is mine. Doesn't get much use nowadays.
No, you don't. You don't feel us. How can you? You know what?
Thank God we only had a baler to deal with.
I don't wanna prank anymore. Things get real. It's not funny. I'm just gonna be good, stay in my room, go to church, try to do one nice thing per day. I do not wanna prank anymore.
You know this would not happen if we had a union.
Look, I heard about the office. Tough break.
I know he loves his pick up truck.
[chuckles in agreement] Huh ha! That's cool, man.
Mike, this is the opposite of safety.  You jump, you're gonna serious hurt yourself.
[Falls backwards onto the food table] Oh! Whoa!
It's like she only wants to hook up when Ryan comes around.  It's gotten to the point where I get excited every time I see that little dude walk through the door.
[starts playing the tune to Seasons of Love while Andy sits down]
Baby, if you���re watching this, you're not chubby, you're beautiful. Daddy's just got to sell some cookies. And we're also gonna exercise more. It's gonna be fun.
I told you we're way past rules. We have been for some time now. We start having rules now, everything we built collapses.
Hey I'm not gonna tell you this stuff if you gonna throw it back in my face.
Hey, y'all wanna hear some loud music or something?
OK, um, I like Erin's hair. It's a very pretty color.
You're on your own, Mike. [gets up and starts to walk away]
Jim, I got my ass chewed out because one of your orders got messed up. And Andy, you said you drove him to the courthouse.
Already on it. I ordered them by their Google trend ranking so we know who to hit first.
The baler can flatten a car engine.  It can cut off your arm and crush your entire body without skipping a beat.
Once you read the packet, sign the back.
Hey... [sighs] You know what, I could use a breath of fresh air. Let's do it.
Think about it! What other mammal, besides humans, drinks the milk of another mammal? I mean, you don't see a bear drinking raccoon milk.
Darryl Philbin. Then Regis, then Rege, then Roger, then Mister Rogers.
You own a convertible. Come on man that's, that's hot. Women love that stuff right?
Oh yeah, and um there's a Christmas party upstairs tonight, wanted to tell you about.
Come on, Dwight, stop overreacting. I���m getting all my work done here. No customers have complained. Nobody even knows.
Didn't have to see. It was sales. I can feel it. They are out of control.
Actually, Andy, you promised me five minutes to talk about productivity suggestions���
Usually that life is short and tragic. That's okay, right?
Val knit me a beanie. But I can't if it's a ���we're just friends��� beanie or a ���I'm hot, you're hot, let's get it poppin'��� beanie. So I'm gonna up the ante, give her a clearly romantic gift, and we'll get to the meaning of the beanie.
I'm done. I gotta get out of here.
Ten people, Michael. Ten people.  Would you like to be one of them?
Which entitles me to half of both of y'alls money so if you don't mind.
[playing video game with Jim] Oh. Come on!
Andy Bernard can't squirt water in his eye and act like it doesn't freak him out. But you know who can? Older Male Lab Assistant Number One.
Ok, so um, what's his name? All the way in the back there.
[makes sudden sharp turn to the left, causing DVD player to fall out open window, then grins to camera]
[freezes] Ummm��� [a moment later] Alright. Obviously y���all look really busy, and uh, I don���t want to waste your time anymore. Sorry, I just uhh��� Obviously I���m not qualified to be here man, I���m���  I���m a warehouse manager, you know���
If you say so. Hey, good seeing you. Remember, I was never here. All right, then.
All right, fine, you know what? One o'clock.
Uh oh, look at this. Red plastic cup, red plastic cup. How about that?
Why don���t you come along and tell him yourself?
[in a feminine voice] Kevin can't come to the phone right now because he's busy with us.
There's a grill in the warehouse I could bring.
That doesn't mean anything. [to Kevin] Kevin, do you want to buy cookies from me?
Thank you. [Kevin grabs cookie and starts eating it]
Hey, hey, hey. I���ll do one thing with y���all.
I love the desert. It's one of my favorite ecosystems.
This is not a good idea right here.
Look, Andy, even if your ancestors did own slaves, it wouldn't be your fault. This is only weird if you make it weird.
I was born ready! No, I suck at interviews. I had Andy���s job in the bag until my interview.
Let me put my shoes on. [hangs up phone, dial tone]
Nice. Do the damn thing. - Pow! [they fist bump and explode]
[on phone] Yes, there used to be a paper clip that would pop up and say 'Looks like you are writing a letter or resume. Would you like help? I believe his name was... [looks embarrassed at camera] Clippy.
I need you to sign these, we got a shipment going out.
I know Citizen Kane. Rosebud didn't explain why he was how he was, it just represented what was important to him as a child, that he missed.
Yeah that's true.  You gotta call your girl, and get paid.  Show her who wears the pants in the relationship.
You know what? It's your first time, let's split the office. You can have sales, the annex, Creed, and I don't know I'll just take, uh, accounting.
You know what, you're one bad text away from getting blocked.
Yeah, and then he starts tickling you. You know, pretty soon you're laughing and hugging. Before you know it, you've forgotten the whole thing. Ya'll can just go to church together... get an ice cream cone.
One more, yeah. [Again motions to go even higher]
You got it. Pick it up. Take it out.
I would if I owned it and I went broke.
Hey, Devil's Den is that way, we should check it out. That's where the snipers hid.
I���ve been meaning to join a gym. [narrating over a montage of scenes with him and Val] For my health. I used to say I wanted to live long enough to see a black President. I didn���t realize how easy that would be. So now I want to live long enough to see a really, really gay President. Or a supermodel President. I want to see all the different kinds of Presidents.
It's more than necessary, Mike. We need this. Roy? You still have that card from the Dockworker's Union?
If you don't enter them immediately, you forget. What?
You know, I just got Limitless on my iPad. I bet I could get it on the TV.
You made a bad call. And I fixed it. So I'm not apologizing.
Dude, I'm gonna be here all week, right? Five days a week, I figure I'll start slow.
No, that's not as much fun. You know what?
That stuff can come back to get you. It���s called karma. You do not want to be messing around. I got an uncle���
It's dangerous, Michael. Come on, get off this.
Spot a cow, last person to say 'Jackson Five' has to get on its back and ride it.
Yeah, just weekends for now, but pretty soon, I���m switching over.
Hey, you know what would be fun? Like, sleeping.
Just a hunch. Your gift is on the way.
Everybody knows I go to Philly. I've just been using sick days I saved up. But, Erin was so excited about being sneaky-sneaks, I went along with it.
So, the guy shows me the deck he's built. And I'm like, 'I'll call this a deck if it'll make you happy, but this is just a porch without a roof.' [laughter, Oscar looks toward door] It was ridiculous man, it was like-you could maybe get two chairs on the thing. Two lawn chairs.
Guys, guys. That���s so vague. You gotta do the zip plus four. 1-8-5-0-5 dash 7-4-2-7.
[in the bathroom with Robert[ Yeah, I guess sometimes I have nightmares about being buried alive.
You just threw a milkshake in a restaurant where they make minimum wage.
You don���t have to say it if you���re doing it.
Obviously you know how a gym works. So you know I���m not going to pay money for this. You want people to come to your gym? Make a real gym.
Two thousand one hundred seventy-five. [everyone moans] Sorry guys.
Woah-Oh! Haven���t been in one of these in forever.
I was there. That dude is not engaged. I'm not a big believer in therapy, but I'll go into my own pocket to cover his co-pay.
Don't use his real name. George Howard Scubb. It's a devil name.
How far is this place? [turns off radio]
You log in sales at ten different times. If you log ���em all at once, you save a lot of time. It's called batching.
Hey, just so you know, me and you��� I don't think that's ridiculous��� Dot, dot, dot��� dot, dot.
It's all about finding ways to make yourself more efficient. Life hacking, baby. This morning, I brushed my teeth in the shower. Saved my self 90 seconds. Which I just used to explain this to you. Damn it!
Nothing stupid about working for yourself. Hanging out with pro athletes, getting free tickets to the games. That���s why I���m doing it.
If we sell everything but the boat, your mom should be set for about six months.
I was rushing to fill an order.  I put the ladder up to grab a box of three hole from the top shelf.  Next thing I know, I'm on the ground and the ladder's on top of me.
Okay, bring it home now.  And don't forget the new black man phrase I taught you.
Yeah, maybe everyone move one instrument to the right?
[Comes up behind Jim and puts his hands on Jim's shoulders] Ah-Ha-Ha! Philly! Exciting stuff, man.
Her.  Yes, 'her' is qualified to work a dangerous machine.  You are not.  Okay?
Ok, kids. You've all been so good and unbelievably patient so I think you are gonna get some candy!
Every day I have a blueberry muffin. Today, I did not have a blueberry muffin. Should have had the blueberry muffin... especially considering how incredibly superstitious I am.
Yes, thanks to you, who promoted me, after we, uh, interfaced.
Yeah, but then they moved the panel to the same weekend and the Doc crew paid to fly us in. It was kismet.
Mr. Romanko, we were a day late on one of your deliveries, but two of our trucks were down for repairs. It���s very unlikely it would happen again.
Man, you have got to be kidding me.
[walking by with new carpet] What... What's that?  Whatcha doing?
You hired your actor friend to come here as a cop?
Her mom wants me to take her to mass. I guess that's something to do.
You come to my house, bust up my trash cans, call my baby sister an ass****, and told her to eat dog food.
Yeah, ok so what, you buy 40 boxes?
He's not my hire, but I know who he is.
And did your brains tell you to ruin these boxes with grease?
I haven't been to New York in a long time.
We livin��� like rock stars. I���m about to eat free steaks with my sports heroes in 32 different cities.
Andy made me his consigliere. Which means Assistant Regional Manager. I guess he thought I'd be into The Godfather 'cause I'm black. Wrong! I'm into The Godfather 'cause I'm a cinephile. I like Scarface 'cause I'm black.
You should talk in a higher voice 'cause the camera makes you sound weird.
Oh, yeah, I need McMahon, Deion Branch to have big games or else I'm done.
If this company���s going down, I wanna go down on it. With it. I wanna go down with it.
Come on, now, Justine, look... Listen, look, I've been planning this, okay? You cannot do this, Justine.
[feeding a squirrel] I'm giving him a peanut.
That thing were you softly exhale on her neck.
Meredith's a little cute. I'm just realizing. She got, like, a Emma Stone thing.
Yes, I am. Just so everyone's on the same page.
Yeah, yeah me too. I think it���d be like��� You know what? [grabs basketball] I think it���d be like a Kevin Durant jump shot��� Perfecto! [shoots basketball at hoop on wall, basketball misses and lands in fish tank, killing the fish] Oh my god���
Hey Val. Want a beer? It might taste better than that pool water you've been drinking.
That's fascinating. Tell me, what's the significance of the peach orchard, thought?
Lightbulb's burnt out, so it's dark. And the heat from the backup generator keeps it nice and warm. Sometimes I think about it when I'm trying to fall asleep at home. But as far as the rest of the office goes, it doesn't exist, okay?
Hey! He deserves this. And he said I could get in on it too.  [whispers] Yeah.
[plays soft chords and sings]  Couldn't get outta bed today. Wish the alarm clock would go away.
Da  na na na na.  No, no, check it out, look. Da  na na na na... want to do that?
So it really bothers me when somebody comes in here speeding around on a lift, playing with it like a toy. It kind of gets under my skin.
I don't have a plan exactly. More of a loose structure. Gives me freedom to improvise. It's like jazz. [scatting] Andy don't mess with me. [continues scatting] I'll figure something out.
I think she could... sense my sadness, and I, and I found out too late that she... she's the copy editor at the Trib.
Maybe I'll stay overnight.  Got a cousin lives down there.
[opening door to Deangelo's office] Hey, saw Jim come in.  We meeting?
I have a file of applicants here. I just gotta open it, look at it, interview a bunch of guys,hire some of 'em. So I'd say we're in the early stages of the process.
[entering Andy's office] Hey, man. Selling cookies for Jada. Want the same as last year?
Some freaky stuff going on. I was walking behind Gabe and I heard some things.
Wade said we could do the whole country in three months.
I didn't have time because of my daughter.
Oh you could stay too.  He's got a big place.
Let me get this straight. You lost all of it. All your winnings. A hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Higher. [motions with hand to go up more]
Yeah. Yeah, it���s hot. The music is awesome. And the tacos are���for real.
I usually watch TV during my lunch breaks. It's cool?
I'll never be sorry, not for a moment of it.
We work the same hours as you and you just said we work a lot harder
[Jim puts popcorn bag in microwave] Hey, if you don't want to teach me Power Point, just say so.
���Mandate���- Always think of two men on a date. [awkward moment] I have gay friends��� I have one gay friend. [to Jim] Oscar?
Look, I need this. Ok? Your daughter is a pretty little girl. Let her go door-to-door. You think people gonna buy cookies from my [hesitates] chubby daughter?
Ed Truck hired me. Jo promoted me. Gabe listened to me. All you've ever done is say no to me. I have ambition. And you kept me at the same level for years.
You feel connected to his baby over there?
Here's what I'm gonna do, I'm calling corporate and I'm filing a complaint against both of you.
Yeah, Jim's going to philly tomorrow. He said he was gonna take me with him, but that was two months ago. And I haven't heard anything since. I mean, he said that, right?
No, he doesn't. [to Michael] I told her Santa would be here.
You ready for tonight? We gonna tear up the town?
He gets condescending when he's nervous. Or when he's excited or sleepy. Not an easy person to be friends with.
No. I got some work to do. I do got big plans with this company.
Yeah, I taught Mike some new phrases.  I want him to get the raise, I... just can't help myself.
I am serious, Mike.  That's a 10% raise.  That's what I want.
Alright. I mean, it's what you want, so...
Yes sir. [notices Jim's using his coffee mug]
Check out this song I wrote: I'ma love you downstairs tonight... [overlapping chatter]
Hey, Mike, look. How bout we go upstairs, too. You know learn how the office works. We can all switch places today.
Seriously, that was hot. Feel like you and the newsman had a groove going.
Mike, this is barely more than I make.  You been here ten years, dog. [laughs]
You feel connected to this? [hold up his back brace]
I asked for a list. [Dwight rides in on a tricycle, laughing diabolically] ...and a clown.
[Singing] rub a dub dub���I got scrubbed.  ���Sup, darlin���? Everybody, this is Justine. [murmurs of hello from the group] This is Jim and Oscar, everybody.
Look, I'm not down there anymore, so if the guys start making fun of you, you just, you gotta stand up for yourself.
What kind of chicks are you going to meet there?
Somebody just needs to get her attention, tell her it's not OK to do this in public.
Everyday when I came into work, all I wanted to do was leave. So why in the world does it feel so hard to leave right now?
Maybe the grinch hid the Christmas star, and we could ask for clues, and he'll tell us if we're hot or cold.
2,336 pounds. Y'all need to learn some portion control.
Uh. So I guess that was your mom who called me earlier looking for the address? Real deep voiced woman?
Mike, you're a very brave man.  I mean, it takes courage just to
I saw a TLC show on Kate Walsh's home office. All corkboard.
The guy who was in here earlier, interviewed after me, how'd he do?
Uh... [looks at camera] yes?! I was. [sits back down] Little joke!
Finish the joke, Andy. What do African Americans call?
Then I guess I figured out where I stand. This is a love beanie.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. Okay, I made the mistake of sneaking out of here and that���s on me. But I���m not gonna spend the rest of the day here doing stuff with you cause you���re feeling sentimental.
[reads text] Come to parking lot. Crazy pigeon action?
Uh... I have other issues. I'm terrible at math. Overweight. You- you're in great shape. A lot better shape than I am, tell you what.
I've been reading the comics to my daughter since she was three years old. Not once I have used the real captions to Family Circus. That crazy family is hilarious to her for one reason: me.
So you sure you remembered everything for your trip?
Hooray. Live it up big D. ' 'Days like this don't come often enough. Time to celebrate. You deserve this'?
I have a solid relationship with Jo, the company's owner. I have management experience. I have a good friendship with Jim, the head of the Search Committee, and it doesn't hurt that I'm... [in Oprah-like sing-song voice] bla-aaack!
And we all know, baseball does not last forever.
That's what I've been trying to tell you, Mike.  It's serious down there.  We do dangerous stuff, man.  This is shenanigans, foolishness, Nerf-ball.  You live a sweet, little, Nerf-y life.  Sittin' on your biscuit.  Never havin' to risk it.
And you got half a million of these? Well I gotta try it.
It���s 30 degrees out. You drinkin��� a mildshake?
Let me... [Jim shows him the resume again, Darryl looks at it a little longer this time] Oh. Cool. [Jim gives Darryl a thumbs-up, then looks at the camera as Darryl gets up to leave]
I'm gonna tell Jim to go [Bleep] himself.
Andy, it���s Darryl. Take your drawers off your head.
You're right, it's better than you! It's us! [sings] Dunder Mifflin.
Because you're not a daddy, and it's not your baby.
No, no, no, no. It's not worth it.
Local musician? Local legend! I used to come hear you play every week at the Deerhead.
No, that's uh. Porn. Pornography. Old lady... nasty... porn.
Oh, I'm sorry Mike, some of my folks got to hear about this one.  [texting on cell phone] Ah. [laughs]
There was a time when the only people who texted you were people you wanted to text you. Girls. And they'd all say the same thing. 'I'm coming over baby.' And I would text back 'BTB', bring that booty.
Looked like it. Sometimes when I'm down like this, it helps to sing the blues.
Jada don't want to spend Christmas with me. She told her mom it wasn't as much fun. And how could she say that? You know, I took her to the toy store to buy her own presents.
Pepper's been getting me out of the house, going on runs.
My biggest fear is that someone will distract us from getting all the shipments out on time.
Yeah sorry, I'm just looking for a pen.
Hey, I like you.  Oh yeah, what's not to like?  But you need to access your uncrazy side, otherwise maybe this thing's run its course.
[clapping] You got this, Roy. [Roy begins playing and singing She's Got a Way by Billy Joel, Pam and Jim looked shocked, Phyllis and Bob begin making out]
That's big of you, man. Takes a lot of courage.
I have my daughter tonight; we're renting Charlotte's Web.
Actually, Val, why don't you come with? I'll need the extra hands to carry them back.
I don't understand the point of a hat.
���This coupon entitles you to one free tickle monster attack���
[Michael and Holly cautiously pass each other] There's another dolly in the truck, Mike. You could take more than that lamp.
I'm not checkin' email till lunch. Four hour work week.
Ohh, that sounds fun and Christmasy, you mean old grinch!
Come on man. I'm being serious. Don't joke.
Oh, yeah, I taught him a handshake, too.
Actually, that was the sound of me eating spaghetti. But I���m gonna let them think the other thing.
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa! So you're just gonna throw away perfectly good food?
[leaving someone a message on his cell phone, looking very uncomfortable] Hey what's up, I just thought I'd try you. I was thinking about that story where you ran into the girl you used to babysit.
She said her name was Brandon, I think. Your mom's name is Brandon?
This may be wrong. But there's a limit to what I would do for my child.
I'm just glad we're gonna try it out.
Glen, could you excuse us? [Andy slams the door after Glen leaves, panting heavily]
And I'm telling them you guys sexually harassed my sister.
2,184 pounds, for a grand total -- oh! You all gained five pounds back.
This doesn't concern you man, you need to walk away.
I don't know... I thought I was enough family for my daughter.
I had no idea. This plumber has pipes!
How about the sales department is the sails?
And I'm gonna play this here share the wealth card.
Well, shall we make it a little interesting?
Show business is cold. Let���s say you get a job, which you probably won���t. They���re not gonna cut you any slack. You���re meant for a job with lots and lots of slack.
You've got a booger bubble going on there.
Thank you. 'Congratulations, Darryl. Let's get wasted.' 'Have fun today, big guy.' 'Aww, yeah. Party time. Whoo-whoop.'
Hang on little ladies. You don't need this thing, I'll go grab my synthesizer. [Everyone cheers]
I have no idea what his problem is, that's just my standard advice. It's good advice right?
Andy, when I was twelve years old, we did a field trip, a lock-in at the zoo. I met this girl, I thought she was so perfect. I was in love with her. But when the sun came up, I knew it wasn't real, 'cause she was ugly and I had grown tired of her. I know you want reception today, but tomorrow you won't want to do her. She's a dog.
You're gonna be missing out on some good ideas.
Um no. This is not a gym. This is like a scene out of Saw 5.
One second, one second, one second. [stops playing] So, this song is from the point of view of a little girl?
[on cell phone] Fourteen years.  Fourteen.  I know.  [laughing]  Ok, alright.  I gotta go.  Later.  [hangs up]
You want to hold me, to see how you feel?
Yeah them, and the Latin Kings... the Warriors...
I'm sure they don't regret having their child, let's move it to the pros.
You didn't feel like he was hiding something?
Well, I'm sorry if it seems that way to you.
Come on! Just show me the Power Point.
Sucks. Anyway, I just don't see it. The Knicks are tough.The Nets are tough.
Oh, come on, man. I thought you had something real.
[enters the office with his daughter, who runs in and hugs Jim] Jada, no, no, no, Jada, what are you doing? [Jim looks knowingly at the camera] Oh. So sorry, guys. I hope my family didn't disrupt your meeting.
It's not just today, it's everyday. It seems like the better title I have, the stupider my job gets.
Andy, this is inappropriate. People died here, man.
My future's not gonna be determined by seven little white lotto balls. It's gonna be determined by two big black balls. I control my destiny. I do.
How would you like it if we booed you?
No! No no no no no!  I said
Yeah, when are they gonna do a Labradoodle that's just Lab?
It's not real... until your wife is on board.
Hey. Hey, look, when you get done with your... [looks inside conference room] meeting, you should, uh, come to the break room. We're having a party.
[Andy walks in Darryl's office] We should schedule meetings, because the days can slip away with chit-chat. Are you crying?
I'll do it better than you. I earned it. I deserve it. I got passed over, God knows why, reasons I cannot and will not understand. The job was mine Andy, everyone said it was mine. Make me manager or fire me.
Well, it's simple Mike. I mean we merged these two branches right?  So now we're shipping twice as many orders as we used to.  With Roy gone we got a smaller crew.  And I'm pickin' up all of his slack, so I think I should be compensated fairly, by gettin' a raise.
[exits Andy's office smiling] All I need is Kevin. Dude buys more cookies than everyone combined and then some. [Kevin waves at him] When I first started selling cookies he was a relatively thin man. Not a thin man, mind you. Relatively thin.
You just made a good idea, a great idea.
Hey, come here. You guys need to see this.
When I worked in the warehouse, I was part of that lotto pool. They won ��� playing my birthday.
That sounds fun, mucking around in the dump. Wish I could go.
No, no, Jim. This is different. This is everything.
I didn't hire anyone if that's why you're here.
Hold up, I'm looking at my spit with a microscope.
Still good. You guys lost a pound. You lost one pound.
I meant dressed up compared to normal. You usually dress like a ghost-buster.
What? Wait, wait, wait? So what? This happening?
Hey, I think this guy playing Sweeney Todd is my plumber.
If we were living in Sweden, I wouldn't have to worry about this 'cause we'd have universal healthcare.
These dudes are definitely in a weird mood. Picked the wrong day to return a truck.
Alright, we're going down to my warehouse, that means we're playing by my rules. No messing with the baler and be cool in front of me and Val. We just broke up.
I just think you���re going into this a little fast.
I brought those in. It's my birthday.  That's some stone-cold narcissism right there.
Back at the bus.  We were locked out.  Phyllis is sitting on the ground eating a dirty sandwich.
I don't know, man, they might think we're drag queens.
I don't know who's got you upset but my advice is stop crying.
Gabe, tell us your stupid rules so we can start the game.
Better get some decent speakers up here then, cause we���re gonna do this right.
This is the spookiest warehouse in the world, kids. You don't believe me? Just take a look. [Kevin chops into Erin, who is dressed as Princess Fiona] Oh. Scary, huh? This is a surgery with an octopus and a burn victim.
Probably shouldn't tell you this, but a lotta guys in the warehouse work multiple jobs, so... we have a place.
Mmm-hmm. [thumping] [Roy groaning] Now you've got to drink.
I was talking like this. [mouths words while pointing to his ear] I don't feel good about it, but he just kept calling himself a gunshot victim and it got to me.
I got Source Code on the way back.
Figured I look presentable. [looks Michael over] You? [Michael dressed casually in jeans and sneakers] Went a different way.
[in a dress shirt and tie] Like what?
When I was a kid, my grandmother used to make me chocolate cake when I wasn't feeling good. She's not around to do that anymore. I'm sorry, I just need a moment to myself just to clear my head.
Mike gave me a list of his top ten Springsteen songs. Three of them were Huey Lewis and the News. One was Tracy Chapman, Fast Car. And my personal favorite, Short People.
That's when somebody really gets in your face, you know, you just... start tickling them.
A restful location. Talk to Glen. He'll take you up in the lift.
Oh, yes! Yes! What'd I tell you? I knew he'd turn up [holds up an iPod inside speakers] You see that? This is the greatest night of my life.
Oh, Mi... ! Hey, stop the video! Michael, stop it right there! Stop it right there! That's that girl from that thing. [pointing at Redheaded Actress] I banged this girl right here. This is...
I like the sound of this. [looks at Dwight] Maybe one day I'll be sitting in Michael's chair. Wouldn't that be something?
Your friends are like Spider-man, if he had gotten bitten by a spider and then got really into masturbating.
Yeah. Just put me out of my misery.
I got too much ice cream. You want some?' 'Getting' my fry on.'
Whoa, I work at a paper company, those things terrify me. They could put us out of business, you know? I heard those machines hold like, ten books at once.
But you want me to put it back in the truck.
Okay, I'll start.  It's pretty simple really. I uh, I think I deserve a raise.  I'm scheduled to get one in six months, but I'd like that to be moved up to now.
Are you wearin' lady clothes?  Those look like lady... pants.
This doesn't help me. I don't respond to that kind of strategy.
Okay, I'm gonna need you to make this right or else we can't be right.
