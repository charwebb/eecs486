Andy, sing us another song.
Really?
That's my go-to thermos. That's all.
So I���m like a three year old girl in this scenario���
Alright. I mean, it's what you want, so...
What?  I can't hear you.
Dude.
Man, we can see all your business coming around the corner, okay? You need to, you know, hide the... good thing you don't have a lot of business to start with.
Still no plan.
Let���s get a drink in you, huh?
Which usually means there's clothes all over the living room.
[sighs]
These are very dangerous machines down here, and the upstairs workers,
They smell so bad.
Kelly ordered this online.
Thank you.
You know, I just got Limitless on my iPad. I bet I could get it on the TV.
We wanted to give you something.
[to Kevin] What's a skinny guy like Toby know about cookies? You can't trust him to understand the wants and needs of the thick man. Maybe Toby from two years ago.
Hell yeah.  You know why?  Because that was my baby.
[clears throat]
Mm-hmm
You have one more free throw shoot. Come on.
That was a good one.
This thing could take your arm off, your head off, you know, just exercise caution.
What?
Damn that was cold.
And I fell and busted my ankle.  I'm legitimately scared for my workers.
Hey.
Nothing stupid about working for yourself. Hanging out with pro athletes, getting free tickets to the games. That���s why I���m doing it.
Holy [bleep], what? Let me see that. It's so light. Like a croissant.
[entering Andy's office] Hey, man. Selling cookies for Jada. Want the same as last year?
Four hours. Almost halfway there.
You wanna make me happy? Huh?
This seems like the kind of thing white people with dreadlocks do.
Looking good, RC!
Pam.
Everyone, we have a voluntary meeting in the conference room to discuss Erin's confidence.
Yeah, totally crazy. Puts me in an insane asylum just thinking about it. I'm stranded on shutter island over here.
That's what we gotta do.
Hell yeah!
Boo! Boo!
You missed a spot.
Kill their fish, and they still hire me. That���s how you do that, baby. It���s all good, I���m ready. Y���all ready for this? [sings intro to ���Everybody dance now���, points to Pam to sing first line]
That���s what I���m talkin��� about.
You haven't even introduced yourself.
Why don't we make it more interesting? Loser buys dinner at Farley's.
Right there.
Oh, this is a gift, for....my man Nate here.
[exits Andy's office smiling] All I need is Kevin. Dude buys more cookies than everyone combined and then some. [Kevin waves at him] When I first started selling cookies he was a relatively thin man. Not a thin man, mind you. Relatively thin.
Chill, man. This plan is airtight.
Great.
I'll come with you, show you how it's done.
No.
I say we have a parade.
Guys, guys. That���s so vague. You gotta do the zip plus four. 1-8-5-0-5 dash 7-4-2-7.
Hey.
Yeah, you should.
Oh my God, I think I see the imprint of a ring pop.
It's Dallas the game, we can figure it out.
Damn!
Hi.
This is embarrassing, Michael.
Let me get this straight. You lost all of it. All your winnings. A hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
And the game's over seconds later.
I'm sure they don't regret having their child, let's move it to the pros.
Every day I have a blueberry muffin. Today, I did not have a blueberry muffin. Should have had the blueberry muffin... especially considering how incredibly superstitious I am.
What's up, Roy?
Hey!
[to camera] There it is.
I didn't say 'a'ight.'
Sure.
Oh, it's nice, it's real nice. People get dressed up.
No. Thank you for your interest in my truck.
And I'm telling them you guys sexually harassed my sister.
Usually that life is short and tragic. That's okay, right?
Hey! Do Not Touch My Radio.
Yeah. Can Dunder Mifflin afford that?
Did you hire 'em?
You know what, you're one bad text away from getting blocked.
OK, everybody smile. Ho! You lost 31 pounds.
Next exit isn't for five miles.
That doesn't mean anything. [to Kevin] Kevin, do you want to buy cookies from me?
Yes. How did he do?
It has been processed.
Mike gave me a list of his top ten Springsteen songs. Three of them were Huey Lewis and the News. One was Tracy Chapman, Fast Car. And my personal favorite, Short People.
Andy made me his consigliere. Which means Assistant Regional Manager. I guess he thought I'd be into The Godfather 'cause I'm black. Wrong! I'm into The Godfather 'cause I'm a cinephile. I like Scarface 'cause I'm black.
Then you gotta have muscles, man. You got some muscles? Let's see.
Take it out. Pick it up. Pick it up. Pick it up. Take it out.
Look, would ya... look.
Hey let's go to Poor Richard's.
Ohh. Ok. I didn't realize we were doing trick questions. What's the safest way to go skiing? Don't ski! [office laughs]
What's
And we all know, baseball does not last forever.
Boo! Boo!
Then I think you should fire me.
No. Can't let you do that Mike.
Yeah, I did. I, I was talking to this girl at a bar.
Oh, it works. Him and me, all right, we are crazy in love. More love than your small mind can comprehend. And we have two disposable incomes. And no kids. And we're taking our business elsewhere. [Oscar and Darryl exit holding hands]
Fun.
Look how happy he is.
I got that cutie behind the counter.
I was talking like this. [mouths words while pointing to his ear] I don't feel good about it, but he just kept calling himself a gunshot victim and it got to me.
Who knows?
Get under your chin first. Yeah.
You're on your own, Mike. [gets up and starts to walk away]
Yeah. We're cool.
So how was the drive in?
Send me one too.
These dudes are definitely in a weird mood. Picked the wrong day to return a truck.
I have a solid relationship with Jo, the company's owner. I have management experience. I have a good friendship with Jim, the head of the Search Committee, and it doesn't hurt that I'm... [in Oprah-like sing-song voice] bla-aaack!
There were times on the two and a half hour drive when I experienced doubt. That's the thing about long drives, you know, you're always going to- this is a gay bar.
Hey I'm not gonna tell you this stuff if you gonna throw it back in my face.
Ahh���We don't really do those. We just sign the thing.
Yeah.
[reading text] Megan Fox. Question mark. What's that mean?
Block, block, block!
And you got half a million of these? Well I gotta try it.
You know what you guys should do? Go to the bookstore at lunch. There's tons of cuties and it's easy to talk to them. 'Hey, what book is that? Cool, let's hang out tonight. Sex already? Whoa...'
You���re a bad man Andy Bernard.
Man, hook you up.
I'll do it better than you. I earned it. I deserve it. I got passed over, God knows why, reasons I cannot and will not understand. The job was mine Andy, everyone said it was mine. Make me manager or fire me.
Thank you. Thank you. No.
You got it. Pick it up. Take it out.
I couldn't do it. I--- I ain't that strong.  And I ain't that brave.
Oh, in the warehouse we use code names for people we want to talk about. Andy was Jelly Roll. Mike was Dennis the Menace. Ryan was douche bag.
Give me your job.
You���re gonna po��� mouth
I don't know, man, they might think we're drag queens.
When I was a kid, my grandmother used to make me chocolate cake when I wasn't feeling good. She's not around to do that anymore. I'm sorry, I just need a moment to myself just to clear my head.
Well, it���s been great.
It's all good, we got this.
When I worked in the warehouse, I was part of that lotto pool. They won ��� playing my birthday.
[opening door to Deangelo's office] Hey, saw Jim come in.  We meeting?
No, no, no...
[Michael and Holly cautiously pass each other] There's another dolly in the truck, Mike. You could take more than that lamp.
Yeah them, and the Latin Kings... the Warriors...
Excuse me?
It's trivia.
I hate that too.
Everybody knows I go to Philly. I've just been using sick days I saved up. But, Erin was so excited about being sneaky-sneaks, I went along with it.
No, no, no.
No.
No, wait. You're, you're supposed to... Never mind. Da  na na na na.
No.
Take your shot man!
Happy hour. My pleasure.
She thought I was McNabb. [laughing]
No.
Two years ago, Andy blamed the warehouse for a late shipment that he forgot to process. We got yelled at pretty bad. Almost lost my job, and I was mad as hell at the time. But I said 'Darryl, just wait. He's a fool. There's gonna be an opportunity. Just be patient.' [smiles]
[Talks drunk angry] Jim, that guy. [Scoffs] You gotta stick to your word! Like when you say something to a buddy, a real buddy...what are you gonna do, lie? To your buddy? [Sighs] It's awful.
Ok, so um, what's his name? All the way in the back there.
OK.
I have a file of applicants here. I just gotta open it, look at it, interview a bunch of guys,hire some of 'em. So I'd say we're in the early stages of the process.
Everyday when I came into work, all I wanted to do was leave. So why in the world does it feel so hard to leave right now?
No, no, Jim. This is different. This is everything.
He���s been sailing for two days.
Alright, yeah fine so whatever...
Thinking about my grandmother a lot.
I'm telling you, don't do it. I've got nothing against strip clubs, but I do have something against them at noon on a Monday. The day shift at a strip club? You can't unsee that.
Yeah, but then they moved the panel to the same weekend and the Doc crew paid to fly us in. It was kismet.
Yeah, maybe everyone move one instrument to the right?
Hey. Hey, look, when you get done with your... [looks inside conference room] meeting, you should, uh, come to the break room. We're having a party.
No, you don't. You don't feel us. How can you? You know what?
Oh [bleep] yeah.
Hey, just so you know, me and you��� I don't think that's ridiculous��� Dot, dot, dot��� dot, dot.
Come on! Just show me the Power Point.
That was cold.
Except my warehouse.
[on phone]It���s Darryl. Erin told me to pretend to be a cop and say your mom died.
[in the bathroom with Robert[ Yeah, I guess sometimes I have nightmares about being buried alive.
Let me tell you something, Oscar. All right, Matt's an okay dude, but he's a dummy. You guys got nothing in common.
I was there. That dude is not engaged. I'm not a big believer in therapy, but I'll go into my own pocket to cover his co-pay.
Yeah sorry, I'm just looking for a pen.
Yeah.
That's 'cause of you, Mike.  They're not gonna give the workin' man more than the boss.
Thank God we only had a baler to deal with.
What's wrong with a level playing field?
Why?
Yeah, he look like Hillary Clinton.
No. I got some work to do. I do got big plans with this company.
You chose one thing?
That's what we need.
I wasn't.
Good morning.
[Low singing] Old, mill, stream.
Higher. [motions with hand to go up more]
Look, I heard about the office. Tough break.
Da  na na na na .
That bothers me too.
Put it on, man.
Thank you.
Busses, though.  They get you home quick.
Huh?
I know he loves his pick up truck.
Hmm. Yeah right
The experience...
Da  na na na na.  No, no, check it out, look. Da  na na na na... want to do that?
[as Jim empties thermos into trash] Nah, nah, nah. You don't have to do that.
But... [Val kisses Darryl]
What?
He does not like that wall.
Toby! Dwight!  Is that them?
Guess I���m going upstairs.
I'm just glad we're gonna try it out.
Here is an old man and a goth dude... and then the old crone from Drag Me to Hell.
What?
Yeah, we did it.
Hell yeah, yeah, yeah. Mo'fo, mo'fo.
Hmhmm.
I didn���t realize we were this close.
Come on, Dwight, stop overreacting. I���m getting all my work done here. No customers have complained. Nobody even knows.
Unh! Damn it!
Let me... [Jim shows him the resume again, Darryl looks at it a little longer this time] Oh. Cool. [Jim gives Darryl a thumbs-up, then looks at the camera as Darryl gets up to leave]
Perfect.
[singing] Out of paper, out of stock, there's friendly faces around the block, break loose from the chains that are causing your pain.
Hey Val. Want a beer? It might taste better than that pool water you've been drinking.
Yeah, yeah me too. I think it���d be like��� You know what? [grabs basketball] I think it���d be like a Kevin Durant jump shot��� Perfecto! [shoots basketball at hoop on wall, basketball misses and lands in fish tank, killing the fish] Oh my god���
What?! Really?
That's big of you, man. Takes a lot of courage.
Ho-ho!
Whoa! That person has really gotten him or herself into quite a predicament.
Hey, man. How are you doing? I, um���I didn���t call ���cause I figured you changed the number.
Hey, get off.
You remember? Yes!
J-j-j-ju...
I love Jim. I love that he hooked me up with a job. It's just, he uses old t-shirts as wash rags. He doesn't wash his dishes. Apparently, they need to [quote-unquote fingers] soak... He hooked me up with a job.
Da  na na na na!!
What you need flour for, Jim?
That was you.
No, he doesn't. [to Michael] I told her Santa would be here.
What you say, bitch? You know, you might be right.
I know, I know. It's just hard.
I worked at a Jiffy Lube.
Then why did you say 'Jackson Five?'
Mike claims, we're all a family isn't that right?
Finish the joke, Andy. What do African Americans call?
There's other pencil's in this office.
Darryl is dating Val... still.
Dunder Mifflin.
No, I'm good. Keep them.
Damn! Jim, you got a real Facebook energy going on here man. You Zuckerberged this place out!
Pepper's been getting me out of the house, going on runs.
You want me to invite Matt?
Uh weight lifting yeah.
Really? That is messed up man.
You must be pretty strong, huh?
Stairs. Oh, man....
[freezes] Ummm��� [a moment later] Alright. Obviously y���all look really busy, and uh, I don���t want to waste your time anymore. Sorry, I just uhh��� Obviously I���m not qualified to be here man, I���m���  I���m a warehouse manager, you know���
Obviously you know how a gym works. So you know I���m not going to pay money for this. You want people to come to your gym? Make a real gym.
Now, this is the forklift.  You need--- [Michael rattles it] You need a license to operate this machine.  That means the upstairs office workers
We are hanging out-right now. You want some more of this?
Hold up, I'm looking at my spit with a microscope.
It's bad.
What have you done for me?
Val. You made it.
Yeah. [music starts]
Like he was... covering something up? Maybe.
Heading to Philly. Interview with Jim���s company.
A buyout.
[taking photo with Jada] Let's see that smile. Go on. [waves to Val]
Oh, ok.
Alright, we're going down to my warehouse, that means we're playing by my rules. No messing with the baler and be cool in front of me and Val. We just broke up.
[on the phone] I just, no, she be talking to your mom or something. This is my daughter too, Justine! You seem to think, [Justine hangs up] oh... pick a damn tree already.
To look good for Val!
I just think you���re going into this a little fast.
Uh huh.
I taught Mike some, uh, phrases to help with his interracial conversations. You know, stuff like, 'Fleece it out.' 'Going mach five.' 'Dinkin' flicka.' You know, things us Negroes say.
Oh, yeah, I taught him a handshake, too.
Make a delivery.
I thought you'd wear a sweater.
No, no, no, no. It's not worth it.
Here you go.
[playing ping-pong] Game, son!
Yes sir. [notices Jim's using his coffee mug]
[walking by with new carpet] What... What's that?  Whatcha doing?
Please...
[plays soft chords and sings]  Couldn't get outta bed today. Wish the alarm clock would go away.
Andy, who punched you?
Are you kidding? You wait.
What?
Well see, um... in the gang world, we use something called Fluffy Fingers.
OK, um, I like Erin's hair. It's a very pretty color.
Taking a load off huh?
Mike.
I was born ready! No, I suck at interviews. I had Andy���s job in the bag until my interview.
[looks to camera for several seconds] At least it's quiet.
You talk to Wade and Colin?
Apt. Apt analysis, Robert.
That's my office.
Pick it up.
[as Cookie Monster] Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum.
What's up man? I'm Darryl.
Take them at the same time.
And I will take you all down.
We'll go after Darth then.
Hey, let's call this what it is.
We work the same hours as you and you just said we work a lot harder
That's good.
Yeah, it's a little much.
If we were living in Sweden, I wouldn't have to worry about this 'cause we'd have universal healthcare.
This... [removes camera headset]
Again, never agreed upon.
Every day.
Forget it, man.
A restful location. Talk to Glen. He'll take you up in the lift.
Welcome to the warehouse.
No.
Hello, hello.
Yeah, Jim's going to philly tomorrow. He said he was gonna take me with him, but that was two months ago. And I haven't heard anything since. I mean, he said that, right?
Because I wanted you to like me.
I'm sitting right here.
Is that grease on my floor?
She said her name was Brandon, I think. Your mom's name is Brandon?
Rachel from the party?
Just getting a tea bag.
I know who did that.
You need to change your standard for what's worthy of a text. Ask yourself is this something Darryl needs to know. The answers almost always no.
Don't use his real name. George Howard Scubb. It's a devil name.
[whispering] They're a bunch of jackals.
Newsies.
Look, Andy, even if your ancestors did own slaves, it wouldn't be your fault. This is only weird if you make it weird.
Figured I look presentable. [looks Michael over] You? [Michael dressed casually in jeans and sneakers] Went a different way.
Her mom wants me to take her to mass. I guess that's something to do.
There's information here? Yeah, you're right, I don't need this.
Okay.
Daaamn!  Mad respect for my brotha!
Andy Bernard can't squirt water in his eye and act like it doesn't freak him out. But you know who can? Older Male Lab Assistant Number One.
That sounds fun, mucking around in the dump. Wish I could go.
Baby, if you���re watching this, you're not chubby, you're beautiful. Daddy's just got to sell some cookies. And we're also gonna exercise more. It's gonna be fun.
It's more than necessary, Mike. We need this. Roy? You still have that card from the Dockworker's Union?
You went to Cornell?
It's so strong.
Apparently we have a visitor. Gabe, everyone.
Hey, what's up?
Ehh, that's not who I'm talking about.
[to Toby] Huh. Hit the road, jack.
[talking head] I'm driving them up for five times what I would've made at work. I thought I made a good deal. [expression changes from smiling to downcast] Then I realized I'm gonna be trapped in a truck with Mike all day.
You're on.
Her.  Yes, 'her' is qualified to work a dangerous machine.  You are not.  Okay?
Mike, this is barely more than I make.  You been here ten years, dog. [laughs]
You're not staying?
Mmm-hmm. [thumping] [Roy groaning] Now you've got to drink.
Hey, how'd you do?
What happens when we're done chewing? Do we spit it out on the floor, or keep it in our mouths the rest of the time?
And did your brains tell you to ruin these boxes with grease?
No, um... I have.
Oh yeah.
I'll put you down for shortbreads.
What'd I tell you about building forts in my warehouse?
You too... Darryl.
And?
Hey, I think this guy playing Sweeney Todd is my plumber.
That felt really good, actually.
Yeah.
What's up, Mike?
I don���t care, choose amongst yourselves. Not the van though.
Cool, cool. Alright, see you later.
I... I just thought you knew me.
I meant dressed up compared to normal. You usually dress like a ghost-buster.
Why? 'Cause I'm from the hood?
Hey Andy.
That's crazy money. I'll take forty.
Yes, yes, yes.
Oh, what's up, Roy?
Who cares?
Oh, yeah, I need McMahon, Deion Branch to have big games or else I'm done.
Phyllis. This rain... does it make you wanna be doing something?
Oh, yes! Yes! What'd I tell you? I knew he'd turn up [holds up an iPod inside speakers] You see that? This is the greatest night of my life.
Yeah that's true.  You gotta call your girl, and get paid.  Show her who wears the pants in the relationship.
[to Val] You know, I don't think I've ever been in this exact angle before. I was scared at first, but I like it.
Man, you have got to be kidding me.
Hey.
I don't have a plan exactly. More of a loose structure. Gives me freedom to improvise. It's like jazz. [scatting] Andy don't mess with me. [continues scatting] I'll figure something out.
[softly] Pieces of paper. [Jo rolls her eyes]
Tacos.
My daughter.
[answers phone] Hello?
All right, got it. 2,210 pounds.
You feel connected to his baby over there?
[Comes up behind Jim and puts his hands on Jim's shoulders] Ah-Ha-Ha! Philly! Exciting stuff, man.
Oh, thank you.
Comfortable, Mike?
It was in the box.
There was a time when the only people who texted you were people you wanted to text you. Girls. And they'd all say the same thing. 'I'm coming over baby.' And I would text back 'BTB', bring that booty.
Scoopity-splash!
It's one of my favorite regions? Did I just sound totally lame? No, I sounded good.
Actually, that was the sound of me eating spaghetti. But I���m gonna let them think the other thing.
You own a convertible. Come on man that's, that's hot. Women love that stuff right?
Cool.
You did good. Real good.
Hey, hey, hey. Vick did his time.
[on phone] Yes, there used to be a paper clip that would pop up and say 'Looks like you are writing a letter or resume. Would you like help? I believe his name was... [looks embarrassed at camera] Clippy.
Sold! To Jim.
No.
That sounds awesome!
Take it all the way up to your lip, yeah.
Hey Michael. This ain't over.
I'm very busy here, man.
Yeah. Yeah, it���s hot. The music is awesome. And the tacos are���for real.
You know.
I wanted to leave quietly. It seemed dignified. But having Kevin grind up on my front while Erin pretends to hump me from behind is a more accurate tribute to my years here. I���m gonna miss these guys.
This is too good.
Summing up.
Start over.
No? OK. I don't wanna be here anymore. Fire me.
What kind of chicks are you going to meet there?
I just don't get it, Pam. I mean, you're a rational person.
Okay, can you just stand right there?  [snaps camera phone picture] I gotta send some e-mails.
Cool. Hey, thanks���
Super comfortable. Like sweatpants for my head.
Yeah, and then he starts tickling you. You know, pretty soon you're laughing and hugging. Before you know it, you've forgotten the whole thing. Ya'll can just go to church together... get an ice cream cone.
Get your own raise.  You gotta get out there and earn, son.
Oh, I never sing with soul.
No.
Why don���t you come along and tell him yourself?
Mike.
Man, see... That's what I've been sayin', man. We need to do this finally.
I hate myself.
I've never been lucky. And I'm not talkin' about the lottery, I'm talkin' 'bout stuff like developing a soy allergy at thirty-five. Who gets a soy allergy at thirty-five? And why is soy in everything?
Fourteen years long.
Who needs it?
You've got a booger bubble going on there.
No man, we are.
So this is cool. I think we make a good fit. [stands up]
Yep.
I been selling here for five years. This is my spot.
Hey man.
It���s 30 degrees out. You drinkin��� a mildshake?
I've been working out. But, the problem is, I've been building muscle underneath. And that top layer hasn't burned off yet. Awkward stage.
Close the door.
The winner: under 'Special Skills,' Mr. Don Feiner put 'Juggling.' [laughter]
My priority is safety.
Hey, I like you.  Oh yeah, what's not to like?  But you need to access your uncrazy side, otherwise maybe this thing's run its course.
Mike you'll drive this every weekend?
[to Jim] What are you doing?
One more, yeah. [Again motions to go even higher]
[clapping] You got this, Roy. [Roy begins playing and singing She's Got a Way by Billy Joel, Pam and Jim looked shocked, Phyllis and Bob begin making out]
What, you don't like the blues?
You a baby daddy?
Right in here?
Yeah.
[watching you tube video, laughing]
Cannonball! [jumps in pool] Let's do this!
All right, what's up Mike?
It's cool. Reading's tricky sometimes.
Just a hunch. Your gift is on the way.
What's his name?
Seriously?
[puts newspaper down] Wow. That dude is good.
You!
Good luck to you.
So if I started singing ���Down By the Old Mill Stream���, you couldn't join me in a three part harmony. [Andy and Officer Foley shake their heads no, Darryl begins singing] Down by the, down by the, down by the....
I don't know. You gonna wash it? Or you gonna let it soak?
Aw, come on. What's the harm? [makes face] Mmm. What flavor was that?
We're going skating.
Would it be more hilarious than Angela having a Chinese baby?
So?
One, two, three, hit it.
OK, great.
Come down, okay?
Daaaaamn! It just keeps on coming, huh?
Yeah they kind of had a specific sound that didn't really fit in with our thing.
I did.
Hey Mike, do my thing.
[interrupting] Stop talking 'bout it. I said I'm fine with it.
Just a couple of grown, sexy-ass roommates.
Come on, Mike, let me borrow the hat for just a couple of hours.
One of 'em, Glenn, is starting one of those fat camps where he steals your kid in the middle of the night. Madge and a couple other guys might start a strip club, but on a boat. And Heday is investing in an energy drink for Asian homosexuals. [Andy laughs awkwardly]
Ahem!
Anybody wanna take a guess?  Anybody?
I put some guys on tonight. Best of your bunch and my bunch. Tell you now though, it's gonna be mostly my bunch.
You're not talking... triple digits?
Well, I'm sorry if it seems that way to you.
Yeah.
It's real bad.
Well, it's effective.
Yes, this is the one.
I'll be there.
Maybe forever. Anyhow���
My biggest fear is that someone will distract us from getting all the shipments out on time.
What kind of job?
I'll take him.
Yes, as a matter of fact, I uh��� [pulls booklets from his bag] I wrote some down. There you go. [passes out booklets] Wow, this guy came prepared, it impresses me! [group laughs]
Paper material, ma'am.
You can owe me.
Correction: we don't care.
I am serious, Mike.  That's a 10% raise.  That's what I want.
Something wrong with the doll?
Obviously, so happy for them both.
You made a bad call. And I fixed it. So I'm not apologizing.
Hey, look, Pennsylvania license plate! That's crazy! All the way out here! Who can name all the states?
Which me am I gonna be today?
There you go.
[Pam knocks on Darryl's door] Don't come in, I'm busy. [Pam opens the door]
Mmmmm.
I'm good.
All right man, don't cry.  It's cool.  I'll let you get it for $400.
I'll take one of those pink pouches.
Thank you.
Come on man. I'm being serious. Don't joke.
Meredith's a little cute. I'm just realizing. She got, like, a Emma Stone thing.
Please call me back.
Like a joke? A knock-knock joke?
Nah. I play for pleasure.
Yeah.
Shh! Movie's almost over.
Make a real gym.
You gotta stop texting me so much.
How would you like it if we booed you?
Paper business.
Okay, shush it. This was a mistake. Let's go. [Darryl and Jada leave, Ryan slowly shakes his head]
Yeah, I guess���
What's wrong with you?
Yeah, she ended things.
Oh, come on, man. I thought you had something real.
Okay. I'll keep working.
Hey, why don't you and me play those?
What's something you really care about?
Thanks, man.
How far is this place? [turns off radio]
And replay.
Here's what I'm gonna do, I'm calling corporate and I'm filing a complaint against both of you.
Slow down, think it over.
Yeah.
Hey what's up? You called?
Yo.
What are you doing with my lunch?
19, serving 4. [serves and scores]
You mean to tell me no one wanted an energy drink for Asian homosexuals?
Oh, oh, I���m sure we did.
Hunger for hamburger.
I haven't been to New York in a long time.
I need you to sign these, we got a shipment going out.
What? [Jim shrugs] How about yesterday?
Mike, I am not having fire-eaters in a paper warehouse.
My summer, I, um, blew out my knee playing softball. Ended up watching CNN most of the time. I don't know how we're going to get out of Afghanistan. I hate the new assistant. He's only been here for a week, and I hate him.
I can't--- what, Mike?  Are you---
Think about it! What other mammal, besides humans, drinks the milk of another mammal? I mean, you don't see a bear drinking raccoon milk.
[scores] Here we go. Here we go. Here we go.
[sighs] Dinkin' flicka.
I feel good today. My little girl Jada? It's my turn to have her for Christmas this year. Two years ago I had her, and we had the best time. I tivoed her favorite shows, some things I've never heard of. iCarly... You know who's funny on that show? The friend with the video camera. He's got a nice way of talking.
That's what I've been trying to tell you, Mike.  It's serious down there.  We do dangerous stuff, man.  This is shenanigans, foolishness, Nerf-ball.  You live a sweet, little, Nerf-y life.  Sittin' on your biscuit.  Never havin' to risk it.
Here we go. Go get him, Mike!
Sup?
That there's a woman's suit.
Val knit me a beanie. But I can't if it's a ���we're just friends��� beanie or a ���I'm hot, you're hot, let's get it poppin'��� beanie. So I'm gonna up the ante, give her a clearly romantic gift, and we'll get to the meaning of the beanie.
I think she could... sense my sadness, and I, and I found out too late that she... she's the copy editor at the Trib.
I hate goodbyes, so last week, when I left Dunder Mifflin for good, I pulled the old Irish Exit. Just slipped out without making a big deal. No hard feelings. No feelings at all.
Be quiet.
Yeah, the booth is lame without it.
Show them what you brought, Mike.
Yup.
It's not a trash compactor!  It's a baler!
Yeah.
Uh, no.
Look, I need this. Ok? Your daughter is a pretty little girl. Let her go door-to-door. You think people gonna buy cookies from my [hesitates] chubby daughter?
You didn't feel like he was hiding something?
Cool.
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa! So you're just gonna throw away perfectly good food?
[To himself] Back for more, huh? [Gets up and walks towards Jim]
Dwight?
Nah, nah...
Hey Mike.
All right, I made it up.
Good slam.
Goodnight.
Whoa, I work at a paper company, those things terrify me. They could put us out of business, you know? I heard those machines hold like, ten books at once.
Who knows what the belt is for?
No.
Stupidest thing I've ever heard.
Your girlfriend? Is your girlfriend Val?
Yes, I am. Just so everyone's on the same page.
That was never agreed upon.
[Singing] rub a dub dub���I got scrubbed.  ���Sup, darlin���? Everybody, this is Justine. [murmurs of hello from the group] This is Jim and Oscar, everybody.
Can���t do what?
You log in sales at ten different times. If you log ���em all at once, you save a lot of time. It's called batching.
Gabe, tell us your stupid rules so we can start the game.
Yep.
What college did you go to Mike?
We���re in play, baby.
Has that ever happened? Ever?
Hey, what���s up?
You done?
Jim is happy here, selling paper at Dunder Mifflin?
Don't don't bother Luke. Got it.
My resolution is to read more. And if someone else is driving me to the bookstore, I can eat my PB&J in the car. 2011 is coming up all Darryl.
Come on, be for real Mike.
Hey, Pam! How are you?
Sounds great.
[leaving someone a message on his cell phone, looking very uncomfortable] Hey what's up, I just thought I'd try you. I was thinking about that story where you ran into the girl you used to babysit.
That's your new standard.
Cool.
I love Philly!
You should talk in a higher voice 'cause the camera makes you sound weird.
Yeah, we're going to get clobbered.
There's a grill in the warehouse I could bring.
You don���t have to say it if you���re doing it.
Tacos were on sale, eight for $3!
It says decaf. You get me decaf?
What else could you possibly be forgetting?
We got an offer on the table.
[to Val] Hey, you caught some of that?
You think you could beat me up?
Thank you. [Kevin grabs cookie and starts eating it]
Dreaming he's a dog on a island.
I can���t really picture it. Can you... get it on there. Yeah. And maybe, get the cheeks.
So you still missing Ryan?
Nice.
Look, I'm not down there anymore, so if the guys start making fun of you, you just, you gotta stand up for yourself.
Local musician? Local legend! I used to come hear you play every week at the Deerhead.
He died.
Hey, um, my daughter said you traded her a headband for her Nintendo DS?
It's not even a thought���
This was your freshman year.
Things? People?
Oh, Mi... ! Hey, stop the video! Michael, stop it right there! Stop it right there! That's that girl from that thing. [pointing at Redheaded Actress] I banged this girl right here. This is...
Yes, Shawn Marion.
[Claps his hands once, spins around] Whoo!
[At Meredtith] Boo!
I'll never be sorry, not for a moment of it.
[Falls backwards onto the food table] Oh! Whoa!
Nope. I'm good. I'm here. Let's find some warehouse workers.
[on phone] This is Darryl.
Hey, man, you put together a pretty fun night for everybody. I saw you talking to Hide. Did you hear that dude's life story? It's amazing, right?
I don't know who's got you upset but my advice is stop crying.
Hey, you know what would be fun? Like, sleeping.
Subway sandwiches.
Actually, Andy, we call this one Dwight, Jr.
Are you serious?
Yeah.
Seriously, that was hot. Feel like you and the newsman had a groove going.
If this company���s going down, I wanna go down on it. With it. I wanna go down with it.
I was rushing to fill an order.  I put the ladder up to grab a box of three hole from the top shelf.  Next thing I know, I'm on the ground and the ladder's on top of me.
[On phone] Hello?....Justine! [laughs] Nice surprise! How you doin' baby?....Nah. No no, I didn't win. When I got promoted I stop-...what?...Yeah. Yeah, Glenn won....Oh, you wanna call him? Yeah, you should call him, congratulate him. That'll be-...What?....Oh, his number's in your old phone. Oh, you know what? I might have it right- [hangs up] Whoops.
Oh, hey.
I don't know.
Hope it's all right.
Come on, now, Justine, look... Listen, look, I've been planning this, okay? You cannot do this, Justine.
[Looking at Jim confused] That's great.
I asked for a list. [Dwight rides in on a tricycle, laughing diabolically] ...and a clown.
It's ok.
We're loading at one.
This is the spookiest warehouse in the world, kids. You don't believe me? Just take a look. [Kevin chops into Erin, who is dressed as Princess Fiona] Oh. Scary, huh? This is a surgery with an octopus and a burn victim.
Hey!  How about instead of yelling at our sweet little Miss Kapoor over five hundred sheets of paper you get back to your desk.  Start sellin' multiple reams like a man.
Make it happen, cap'in.
All right. Se you later...
Okay, I'll start.  It's pretty simple really. I uh, I think I deserve a raise.  I'm scheduled to get one in six months, but I'd like that to be moved up to now.
I got too much ice cream. You want some?' 'Getting' my fry on.'
2,336 pounds. Y'all need to learn some portion control.
I haven't hired anyone.
Bang.
Sometimes it seems like it was better down in the warehouse, you know?
I loved it.
Go ahead.
Well, when they merged the two branches together, they put
[speaking Spanish] Por favor, tequila seoor.
Cool.
Iverson. Yeah, always man. It's very important.
Nah man, we get along now.  Real well.
So you sure you remembered everything for your trip?
Um no. This is not a gym. This is like a scene out of Saw 5.
I usually watch TV during my lunch breaks. It's cool?
You really re-did Andy's office, huh?
Why, did you meet someone?
No.
I���ll introduce you.
Lightbulb's burnt out, so it's dark. And the heat from the backup generator keeps it nice and warm. Sometimes I think about it when I'm trying to fall asleep at home. But as far as the rest of the office goes, it doesn't exist, okay?
Yeah.
Cool. Okay. Sorry I lied.
[playing video game with Jim] Oh. Come on!
What are you doing here, Gabe?
That could work.
[in a feminine voice] Hi. This is Alex.
Hey, Mike, look. How bout we go upstairs, too. You know learn how the office works. We can all switch places today.
���Mandate���- Always think of two men on a date. [awkward moment] I have gay friends��� I have one gay friend. [to Jim] Oscar?
[sighs] I���m gonna miss the paper business.
Yeah, this isn't happening.
Okay, bring it home now.  And don't forget the new black man phrase I taught you.
[fake whispers to Roy] I think he feels bad.
Mike, you can't do that. It's conflict of interest.
Roy left years ago. What's his name?
You mean what did we do the last time the warehouse won the lottery?
You don't say?
He's not my hire, but I know who he is.
Two thousand one hundred seventy-five. [everyone moans] Sorry guys.
I didn't hire anyone if that's why you're here.
[reads text] 'Are you watching this?' Seriously?
Tell 'em your story, Hide.
Yes. I do remember saying something like that to you.
Wow. Man. I hope he doesn���t regret it.
Then I guess I figured out where I stand. This is a love beanie.
I believe I want to go home.
Oh yeah, and um there's a Christmas party upstairs tonight, wanted to tell you about.
You're such a great friend.'
Delivered all my furniture to Philly. Hey, keep it down, though. Nobody knows I���m here.
Dracula.
Good luck with that.
You know this would not happen if we had a union.
I'ma call Roy, man.
Hey, Devil's Den is that way, we should check it out. That's where the snipers hid.
I have plans later.
What do you mean ���they left���?
Mike.
You're not as scary as Book Face, over there.
She's six.
Look you need to pick yourself up. Man up, alright? You will win this in the end. It's all about heart, and character. Be your best self.
I don���t do that anymore.
[claps] That was great man. Alright, I'm out of here.
There's nothing out here man.
What's it say?
Why do you wanna work here?
I can hear you.
Correct.
Checkin' in with Chet. Doppler's up.
Yeah, I'm gonna ask questions and I might not do what you say.
Hey, are we doing this thing?
You just threw a milkshake in a restaurant where they make minimum wage.
You say we're the same, but we get compensated very differently.
Yeah, I've seen Santa.
What?
Hey, hey, hey. I���ll do one thing with y���all.
The space dust does it.
OK.
That's sweet Mike. Let's see here. There's a chapter, called Gum. With one sentence. Everybody likes the guy who offers him a stick of gum.
Me and Val were going nowhere and if I'm gonna be working in Philly, I'm gonna need my freedom. So, I convinced Val to breakup with me. Here's how you do it. You say, 'What are you gonna do, breakup with me?' Like it's a joke, and then you gain a lot of weight.
She's trying.
[singing in different tune] Out of paper, out of stock, there's friendly faces around the block, break loose from the chains that are causing your pain. Call Michael, Stanley, Jim, Dwight or Creed. Call Andy and Kelly for your business paper needs. Call Dunder Mifflin.
You could be.
Sounds all right.
Nobody told me what people were, alright? So...  label yourselves or take what you get.
That was definitely not dancing.
How much?
You just made a good idea, a great idea.
It can.
[feeding a squirrel] I'm giving him a peanut.
What's rap?
Who?
Actually, Val, why don't you come with? I'll need the extra hands to carry them back.
No... yes, yes. Why wouldn't I... wanna pretend to be gay? Got no problem with that.
I did. I did have a fantastic basement. Now it smells like tacos. You can't air out a basement and taco air is heavy. Settles at the lowest point.
Who's it?
Were the boxes near each other?
It's Lejon Brames.
[Dwight heads toward a strip club] Oh, no, no, no. Uh-uh.
All right, this is just messed up.
This may be wrong. But there's a limit to what I would do for my child.
It���s not pizza.
Exactly like this.
That thing were you softly exhale on her neck.
I put three pallets on the truck to Blue Cross once a week. They use a lot of paper.
Yes! [to video screen]  Right here. You are a naughty girl!
[tears welling up in his eyes]
We livin��� like rock stars. I���m about to eat free steaks with my sports heroes in 32 different cities.
I'll answer that, Jim. I would use it as an opportunity to teach, uh, about actions... and consequences... of actions. [Jim and Gabe stare at Darryl]
I���m going for a walk.
To the arcade.
You come to my house, bust up my trash cans, call my baby sister an ass****, and told her to eat dog food.
Da  na na na na.
Yes sir.  Remember that.  I'll be right outside if you need me
Oh, yeah?
You want to hold me, to see how you feel?
Life hacking, man.
That's fascinating. Tell me, what's the significance of the peach orchard, thought?
It's all about finding ways to make yourself more efficient. Life hacking, baby. This morning, I brushed my teeth in the shower. Saved my self 90 seconds. Which I just used to explain this to you. Damn it!
Presbyterian.
Do it!
Michael, you know you don't have to turn us all in. All you need is one scapegoat.
What do you say?
Oh you could stay too.  He's got a big place.
Popsicles?
That's regular text talk.
Still good. You guys lost a pound. You lost one pound.
127 hours. It's about this guy who-
Jada don't want to spend Christmas with me. She told her mom it wasn't as much fun. And how could she say that? You know, I took her to the toy store to buy her own presents.
Curl up with your favorite DVD.
Dwight, come back and spot me.
I was in The Whiz in high school.
I've seen this, that's not you.
Dude, I'm gonna be here all week, right? Five days a week, I figure I'll start slow.
It���s ok E-Dog, just who called?
You hired your actor friend to come here as a cop?
You're the tutorial.
What? Is he retiring? You getting him a gift or something?
I���ll take a look.
Da  na na na na.
If you loan me some money.
Why would you think a lady is me?
It's defense.
That happens a lot?
Yeah, I'll say something. I think we should be acknowledging our boss, because none of us would be here without him. Robert California! [everyone toasts]
No.
It's not a race.
Uh, 'The moon is huge tonight.'
You ready for me?
What?
If I were Val, I would break up with Brandon. Then I would date the hell out of me. I wouldn't give in to me too fast, let me buy myself some nice dinners and such. But when I finally did give in, I would go crazy on myself.
I'm very busy with time-sensitive work.
Wow. Yeah, we gonna read it.
Dunder Mifflin.
You're right, it's better than you! It's us! [sings] Dunder Mifflin.
A lot... of things.  Uh, you, uh... What about Jan?  Lovely, lovely, lovely Jan, man.  It's goin' good, right?
Well, shall we make it a little interesting?
Yeah!  Da  na na na na.
You said no to this one!
���This coupon entitles you to one free tickle monster attack���
No, it's my plumber. Says so in his bio. Apparently the director discovered him doing karaoke. It's his first play. He didn't even audition.
No no no no.  I like her.
Don't just take the first job that comes your way. Cause next thing you know, it's ten years later and you���re still there. Could write your obituary tomorrow, it's not gonna change.
I was still thinking of going back to school.
[bluesy] Da na na na na...  da na na na  na...
Kind of embarassing.
Thanks man.
Well, [points at Michael] those are some awful tight pants you have on. Where'd you get em? Like Queers R Us?
The man is paying me to take Chinese.  I will say what I need to say, and soon, I will say it in Chinese.
We just have a lot of stuff down there that could be stolen.
We good.
Rosebud?
No, no, I���m not here actually. These donuts are part of my escape from the guys at the warehouse I didn���t say goodbye to.
Uh. So I guess that was your mom who called me earlier looking for the address? Real deep voiced woman?
The guys did invite me out to celebrate but I decided to just stay home. Eat a bunch of tacos in my basement.
That's a great plan.
Union! Union, yeah.
I'll come with you.
Got it.
I don't wanna prank anymore. Things get real. It's not funny. I'm just gonna be good, stay in my room, go to church, try to do one nice thing per day. I do not wanna prank anymore.
Why?
Didn't have to see. It was sales. I can feel it. They are out of control.
Wade said we could do the whole country in three months.
I'm back together with Val. Yay...
Thanks, man.
Oh yeah.
This doesn't help me. I don't respond to that kind of strategy.
I know it's hard Mike. Break-ups hurt.
Dwight, look, I���m sorry you���re having a hard time with this, okay? Athlead is my future. No disrespect to Dunder Mifflin, but if I can have fun at work, I want that.
Tracee Ellis Ross. Daughter of the First Lady of Motown, Diana Ross.
Hang on little ladies. You don't need this thing, I'll go grab my synthesizer. [Everyone cheers]
Jim was nice enough to give me his bedroom.
We do safety training every year, or after an accident. ... We've never made it a full year.  This particular time, I was reaching for a supply box on the top shelf, when one office worker, who shall remain nameless, kicked the ladder out from under me and yelled...
Man, you can't do that stuff. You'll only find pain. When my ex-wife got into my e-mail account, she was devastated.
Mike, I'm very busy down here. [eats chicken]
Why is the forklift in the wall?
No.
Spot a cow, last person to say 'Jackson Five' has to get on its back and ride it.
He gets condescending when he's nervous. Or when he's excited or sleepy. Not an easy person to be friends with.
I can videotape it.
If you don't mind.
I have my daughter tonight; we're renting Charlotte's Web.
All right, fine, you know what? One o'clock.
It's not real... until your wife is on board.
This is not a good idea right here.
Oh, hey Val.
I would if I owned it and I went broke.
That stuff can come back to get you. It���s called karma. You do not want to be messing around. I got an uncle���
Oh yeah.
Chicken piccata, salad on the side please.
Processed.
Good policy. Sensible. Smart.
So, the guy shows me the deck he's built. And I'm like, 'I'll call this a deck if it'll make you happy, but this is just a porch without a roof.' [laughter, Oscar looks toward door] It was ridiculous man, it was like-you could maybe get two chairs on the thing. Two lawn chairs.
Yeah, well, watcha gonna do?
No. You're wrong.
You just said you hated it.
Already on it. I ordered them by their Google trend ranking so we know who to hit first.
Wrap it up, Gabe.
Yeah. Just put me out of my misery.
2,184 pounds, for a grand total -- oh! You all gained five pounds back.
It was kind of mumbled, I don't know, uh, only thing I could make out clearly was 'Andy,' 'Problem,' 'Eliminate,' something. I don't know what it meant.
Yeah, but I never said you had nothing to live for.
Both.
You're such a great friend, dot dot dot dot dot.'
[on cell phone] Fourteen years.  Fourteen.  I know.  [laughing]  Ok, alright.  I gotta go.  Later.  [hangs up]
Are you with us Mike?
Michael.
Yup.
No, that's uh. Porn. Pornography. Old lady... nasty... porn.
Actually, Bob Vance bought out the warehouse. So he's keeping on the whole crew. So, we good.
No.
Way
All right.
No, no, no. Maybe just later.
Well you should definitely come. The foreman always comes. Plus it's fun, you know cookies, smoked fish, alcohol, people acting stupid.
Yes, thanks to you, who promoted me, after we, uh, interfaced.
I included some time saving ideas...
[clears throat] Notice anything different about me?
I think if I had parents like that I'd be trying to convince everyone all the time how great I was, too.
Back at the bus.  We were locked out.  Phyllis is sitting on the ground eating a dirty sandwich.
We're the ones that got to clean that up!
Right.
I've been reading the comics to my daughter since she was three years old. Not once I have used the real captions to Family Circus. That crazy family is hilarious to her for one reason: me.
Look man this is a bad idea.
No. I was clearing my throat.
My future's not gonna be determined by seven little white lotto balls. It's gonna be determined by two big black balls. I control my destiny. I do.
[pats Andy on the back] Thank you.
Yeah, when are they gonna do a Labradoodle that's just Lab?
What? Wait, wait, wait? So what? This happening?
I���m lifting.
I shall come by at your convenience.
Nope. His name is Michael. [Michael makes the da dum ksch on the drumset again]
No! No no no no no!  I said
No big deal. No big deal.
We can look into it.
That's what I'm talking about!
I didn't say anything.
Mm hmm.
It's getting bigger.
Mmm. [they clink cups]
[in a dress shirt and tie] Like what?
It's dangerous, Michael. Come on, get off this.
I can go get us some tacos.
Well, it's simple Mike. I mean we merged these two branches right?  So now we're shipping twice as many orders as we used to.  With Roy gone we got a smaller crew.  And I'm pickin' up all of his slack, so I think I should be compensated fairly, by gettin' a raise.
But you want me to put it back in the truck.
Jim, I got my ass chewed out because one of your orders got messed up. And Andy, you said you drove him to the courthouse.
If we sell everything but the boat, your mom should be set for about six months.
It's cool that you like the southwest. It's one of my favorite regions.
Alright, we outta here.
Yeah, Jim.
Okay, I'm gonna need you to make this right or else we can't be right.
And I'm gonna play this here share the wealth card.
Hooray. Live it up big D. ' 'Days like this don't come often enough. Time to celebrate. You deserve this'?
Hey, Andy.
I know, right.  Merry Christmas.
Good times.
We're friends. We're friends.
Good morning.
Hiding from his momma.
Once you read the packet, sign the back.
You know what? It's your first time, let's split the office. You can have sales, the annex, Creed, and I don't know I'll just take, uh, accounting.
No, that's not a good idea. I don't see that as a very good song.
No do not touch it!
Oh, thanks. Thanks. No.
[sighs] Maybe, sweetheart. Single dad. Challenges.
Andy, when I was twelve years old, we did a field trip, a lock-in at the zoo. I met this girl, I thought she was so perfect. I was in love with her. But when the sun came up, I knew it wasn't real, 'cause she was ugly and I had grown tired of her. I know you want reception today, but tomorrow you won't want to do her. She's a dog.
Anybody?
If you don't enter them immediately, you forget. What?
I would.
Da  na na na na.
So, uh... here you go. [gives resume to Jim]
I brought those in. It's my birthday.  That's some stone-cold narcissism right there.
They left you in the lurch, and if they want to jump in, it means you're almost there. You did this. Bring it home.
Right on, son.
All right.
Thanks. [to Val] Nice flowers.
So it really bothers me when somebody comes in here speeding around on a lift, playing with it like a toy. It kind of gets under my skin.
What kind of bread you making? Pumpernickel?
Um, where did you get that story?
Make that face he likes.
Action!
WHAT!?
[Jim puts popcorn bag in microwave] Hey, if you don't want to teach me Power Point, just say so.
Uh��� yeah. Depending on traffic.
But you're singing it.
You're new to the game. You learned a lesson today. See you next year, sport.
Yeah, we had a few fights, I suppose.  But last night we put a lot of that to bed.  I can���t tell you what I did with my ex wife last night���. I have to sing it.  [singing] We took a shower, we were naked. We ska dap dap doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.
Come on, stay, alright? It's good for people to get to know you.
It does not say dangerous. And there's no exclamation point.
[entering] What are y���all doing?
I got a game. Cow surfing.
Better get some decent speakers up here then, cause we���re gonna do this right.
You know, get it right.
Let me see it!
Whoa! Hold on.
I have a kid. Last week, Jim at home? That was no vacation.
How about you, man.  Comfortable?
Some freaky stuff going on. I was walking behind Gabe and I heard some things.
There is no occasion for you to go near this stuff, okay?
Hey. While I got you on the phone, your husband's like a sloppy, homeless hobo. Can you fix that?
I'm in.
You ready for tonight? We gonna tear up the town?
Yeah, I taught Mike some new phrases.  I want him to get the raise, I... just can't help myself.
You guys lost four pounds.
Yes.
What do you want, baby? We got some granola, got some cupcakes, chips, apples, pies...
Hey, man. Darryl.
I'm telling you how to do this man.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. For sure. For sure. for sure. Man!  And Pam's into it?
Thanks, it's cool. So...
I'll be your croak monsieur.
Mr. Romanko, we were a day late on one of your deliveries, but two of our trucks were down for repairs. It���s very unlikely it would happen again.
Yeah where is it?
Sucks. Anyway, I just don't see it. The Knicks are tough.The Nets are tough.
Oh, I'm sorry Mike, some of my folks got to hear about this one.  [texting on cell phone] Ah. [laughs]
Oh, no. I mean, I want to, I just...I don't want to force you into something you don't want to do.
All right, I'm being a jerk. You got me this job. I should be grateful. I am, I just... you know, I get finicky about my stuff. That's all.
Uh... I have other issues. I'm terrible at math. Overweight. You- you're in great shape. A lot better shape than I am, tell you what.
Loyalty.
Well you lost zero pounds. [everyone grumbles]  No change.  On the bright side you gained zero pounds.
Yes.
How many people a year do you think get their arms cut off in a baler?
Cool. It should be taller though, right?
Hey, Mike.
I got my whole life to be a minority executive. I only have about a year left in these knees, though.
That's okay, Mike.
[in a feminine voice] Kevin can't come to the phone right now because he's busy with us.
Eat it.
I'm not sleeping with your girlfriend.
I just did, like, 35 minutes on the treadmill.
Let me see it.
You crushed our spirits, Gabe. Congrats. You're a big man, huh? Take a lot to destroy the creativity of a whole group of people. [notification tone] [laughter]
[starts playing the tune to Seasons of Love while Andy sits down]
Actually, Andy, you promised me five minutes to talk about productivity suggestions���
To push this bar up.
Cheeseburger or hamburger.
Me.
The guy who was in here earlier, interviewed after me, how'd he do?
Dwight.
Thank you.
Three Kings.
[Andy walks in Darryl's office] We should schedule meetings, because the days can slip away with chit-chat. Are you crying?
Somebody just needs to get her attention, tell her it's not OK to do this in public.
You feel connected to this? [hold up his back brace]
Yeah, just weekends for now, but pretty soon, I���m switching over.
Ohh, that sounds fun and Christmasy, you mean old grinch!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. Okay, I made the mistake of sneaking out of here and that���s on me. But I���m not gonna spend the rest of the day here doing stuff with you cause you���re feeling sentimental.
Are you wearin' lady clothes?  Those look like lady... pants.
Nice. Do the damn thing. - Pow! [they fist bump and explode]
Back off! I got my reasons.
Andy, this is inappropriate. People died here, man.
So this is a ten-gallon hat, huh?
I���ve been meaning to join a gym. [narrating over a montage of scenes with him and Val] For my health. I used to say I wanted to live long enough to see a black President. I didn���t realize how easy that would be. So now I want to live long enough to see a really, really gay President. Or a supermodel President. I want to see all the different kinds of Presidents.
You accept these terms?
Show business is cold. Let���s say you get a job, which you probably won���t. They���re not gonna cut you any slack. You���re meant for a job with lots and lots of slack.
Yeah, ok so what, you buy 40 boxes?
Thank you. 'Congratulations, Darryl. Let's get wasted.' 'Have fun today, big guy.' 'Aww, yeah. Party time. Whoo-whoop.'
[approaches Kevin] Would you like to buy some cookies?
That was a triple.
Alright! [high fives Pam]
Uh oh, look at this. Red plastic cup, red plastic cup. How about that?
Follow me, I got a space. After you.  I���ve been thinking about you all mornin���.  I don���t know what you did, I can barely walk today.
When did I get so fat?
YEAH! Da  na na na na.
Thank you go much.
Too late.
Dunder Mifflin.
You didn't have to boo him.
[setting stopwatch] Go.
You could go downstairs and ask them?
I don't
Hey, y'all wanna hear some loud music or something?
You're gonna be missing out on some good ideas.
[rubs face in exasperation]
I can't. You know that.
A book about oceans.
It's cool really.
Mike, why do you have to control how he perceives it in his mind?
Yeah, that���s crazy.
Dwight!
Looks that way.
Not really.
Whoa. I hadn't even thought of that.
I had no idea. This plumber has pipes!
Because you're not a daddy, and it's not your baby.
Getting my sweat on.
Your mom?
[noticing Erin in the background leading a black man dressed in a suit through the office] Who's that?
Looked like it. Sometimes when I'm down like this, it helps to sing the blues.
What's up man?
It's not safe, you don't have a license.
Thanks, man.
No, that's not as much fun. You know what?
Help me!
She was about to turn 97.
Uh uh uh. Don't shush me.
That's when somebody really gets in your face, you know, you just... start tickling them.
Uh... [looks at camera] yes?! I was. [sits back down] Little joke!
I don't know, man. Y'all quit with a lot of confidence. I mean, it was like, y'all came up in here dancing and everybody was- [sees Val] ooh, hold on a second. [sees Brandon] Oh.
A lot has changed since y'all left, okay? You're gonna have to jump through some hoops. And the new foreman is here. Now she's one of the best we've ever known, okay? So I need you to show her your upmost respect. Make sure she feels welcome and at home, okay? Can you do that?
Oh, my bad. Goodbye, everybody.
I'm not mad. Are you mad?
Yeah, sure, sure. I'll be right in.
What the hell is wrong with you?
We did it! Hey, and look, the buyers wanna make sure it���s not just a Philly play, so get this: they���re gonna pay for us to go pitch out west. We talking Spurs, the Jazz, Cowboys. Blake Griffin, baby.
I told you we're way past rules. We have been for some time now. We start having rules now, everything we built collapses.
Yeah. You too, huh?
A car parked in the sun is like a toaster oven.
Nine first.
It's getting late. I thought you guys could use a little [sets up laptop] inspiration.
Yes, I love Philly! Two-One-Five or die!
What do we have here?
Yep. Take care.
Okay, I'm not doing that.
Nahh! [shakes head] No. Not Justine. Never Justine.
Hey.
Think that through for a sec.
[in background] You have to be alert, and calm. And always careful...
Mm, it's not that big.
I like the sound of this. [looks at Dwight] Maybe one day I'll be sitting in Michael's chair. Wouldn't that be something?
Silent. Look, congratulations.
Dallas indeed.
There you go.
Mmhmm. [points at gabe] Caramel soy latte.
I had to. I needed defense.
$30.00
Andy, it���s Darryl. Take your drawers off your head.
That's it.
I love the desert. It's one of my favorite ecosystems.
Don't go breaking my scale.
I love it. And it���s Athleap now. And the city is amazing.
I saw a TLC show on Kate Walsh's home office. All corkboard.
Damn!
Yeah.
[Dwight and Jim enter office] Hey, hey. They're back. [Everyone greets them]
I wouldn't enjoy that.
[Kevin scratches cookie order form and sniffs it] It's not a scratch-and-sniff, Kev.
What? All right!
You need to get back on top.
That's when you hit me with what's getting you down, okay?
Would you just fire me, man?
Should you drive the forklift?
Let me put my shoes on. [hangs up phone, dial tone]
My pleasure.
Song's about truth.
My bad.
I don���t think I sh-
Is she sick? How are her poops?
Since Andy promoted me to assistant regional manager, I've been trying to step my game up, you know, be more productive. In fact, you know what? Let���s knock out a few more of these sound bites while we're here. [pauses] Whoa! That person has really gotten him or herself into quite a predicament.
Hey... [sighs] You know what, I could use a breath of fresh air. Let's do it.
If you say so. Hey, good seeing you. Remember, I was never here. All right, then.
It's like Driving Miss Daisy, you know?
