[makes sudden sharp turn to the left, causing DVD player to fall out open window, then grins to camera]
You say we're the same, but we get compensated very differently.
Yes. All of 'em. Together. It's a conspiracy. Listen to me, Mike, you gotta do something about them.
Actually, Andy, we call this one Dwight, Jr.
Look, I need this. Ok? Your daughter is a pretty little girl. Let her go door-to-door. You think people gonna buy cookies from my [hesitates] chubby daughter?
Why don't we make it more interesting? Loser buys dinner at Farley's.
[interrupting] Stop talking 'bout it. I said I'm fine with it.
Then you gotta have muscles, man. You got some muscles? Let's see.
[on phone] Yes, there used to be a paper clip that would pop up and say 'Looks like you are writing a letter or resume. Would you like help? I believe his name was... [looks embarrassed at camera] Clippy.
Uh oh, look at this. Red plastic cup, red plastic cup. How about that?
Yeah, I taught Mike some new phrases.  I want him to get the raise, I... just can't help myself.
You have one more free throw shoot. Come on.
That's 'cause of you, Mike.  They're not gonna give the workin' man more than the boss.
You mean what did we do the last time the warehouse won the lottery?
It's dangerous, Michael. Come on, get off this.
Take it all the way up to your lip, yeah.
We do safety training every year, or after an accident. ... We've never made it a full year.  This particular time, I was reaching for a supply box on the top shelf, when one office worker, who shall remain nameless, kicked the ladder out from under me and yelled...
I did. I did have a fantastic basement. Now it smells like tacos. You can't air out a basement and taco air is heavy. Settles at the lowest point.
Oh, in the warehouse we use code names for people we want to talk about. Andy was Jelly Roll. Mike was Dennis the Menace. Ryan was douche bag.
Yeah. Just put me out of my misery.
Sucks. Anyway, I just don't see it. The Knicks are tough.The Nets are tough.
Andy, this is inappropriate. People died here, man.
Follow me, I got a space. After you.  I���ve been thinking about you all mornin���.  I don���t know what you did, I can barely walk today.
Wade said we could do the whole country in three months.
I told you we're way past rules. We have been for some time now. We start having rules now, everything we built collapses.
No, you don't. You don't feel us. How can you? You know what?
I love the desert. It's one of my favorite ecosystems.
Well, shall we make it a little interesting?
Nahh! [shakes head] No. Not Justine. Never Justine.
Guys, guys. That���s so vague. You gotta do the zip plus four. 1-8-5-0-5 dash 7-4-2-7.
Well, it's simple Mike. I mean we merged these two branches right?  So now we're shipping twice as many orders as we used to.  With Roy gone we got a smaller crew.  And I'm pickin' up all of his slack, so I think I should be compensated fairly, by gettin' a raise.
Back at the bus.  We were locked out.  Phyllis is sitting on the ground eating a dirty sandwich.
It does not say dangerous. And there's no exclamation point.
Andy, it���s Darryl. Take your drawers off your head.
Uh... I have other issues. I'm terrible at math. Overweight. You- you're in great shape. A lot better shape than I am, tell you what.
Oh yeah, and um there's a Christmas party upstairs tonight, wanted to tell you about.
All right, I'm being a jerk. You got me this job. I should be grateful. I am, I just... you know, I get finicky about my stuff. That's all.
We're the ones that got to clean that up!
That thing were you softly exhale on her neck.
When I worked in the warehouse, I was part of that lotto pool. They won ��� playing my birthday.
Nah man, we get along now.  Real well.
Look, Andy, even if your ancestors did own slaves, it wouldn't be your fault. This is only weird if you make it weird.
My resolution is to read more. And if someone else is driving me to the bookstore, I can eat my PB&J in the car. 2011 is coming up all Darryl.
You should talk in a higher voice 'cause the camera makes you sound weird.
No? OK. I don't wanna be here anymore. Fire me.
I was in The Whiz in high school.
Alright. I mean, it's what you want, so...
Dwight, look, I���m sorry you���re having a hard time with this, okay? Athlead is my future. No disrespect to Dunder Mifflin, but if I can have fun at work, I want that.
It's Dallas the game, we can figure it out.
Once you read the packet, sign the back.
Actually, Val, why don't you come with? I'll need the extra hands to carry them back.
This thing could take your arm off, your head off, you know, just exercise caution.
The baler can flatten a car engine.  It can cut off your arm and crush your entire body without skipping a beat.
[to Kevin] What's a skinny guy like Toby know about cookies? You can't trust him to understand the wants and needs of the thick man. Maybe Toby from two years ago.
I had no idea. This plumber has pipes!
Look, just be straight with me, man. You can be gay with Matt, just be straight with me.
OK, um, I like Erin's hair. It's a very pretty color.
[reading text] Megan Fox. Question mark. What's that mean?
[in a feminine voice] Hi. This is Alex.
We just have a lot of stuff down there that could be stolen.
Thank you. [Kevin grabs cookie and starts eating it]
Ahh���We don't really do those. We just sign the thing.
[noticing Erin in the background leading a black man dressed in a suit through the office] Who's that?
Whoa, I work at a paper company, those things terrify me. They could put us out of business, you know? I heard those machines hold like, ten books at once.
No... yes, yes. Why wouldn't I... wanna pretend to be gay? Got no problem with that.
You didn't feel like he was hiding something?
You're right, it's better than you! It's us! [sings] Dunder Mifflin.
[enters the office with his daughter, who runs in and hugs Jim] Jada, no, no, no, Jada, what are you doing? [Jim looks knowingly at the camera] Oh. So sorry, guys. I hope my family didn't disrupt your meeting.
I haven't been to New York in a long time.
If I were Val, I would break up with Brandon. Then I would date the hell out of me. I wouldn't give in to me too fast, let me buy myself some nice dinners and such. But when I finally did give in, I would go crazy on myself.
I don't know who's got you upset but my advice is stop crying.
When I was a kid, my grandmother used to make me chocolate cake when I wasn't feeling good. She's not around to do that anymore. I'm sorry, I just need a moment to myself just to clear my head.
Well, when they merged the two branches together, they put
Yeah, Jim's going to philly tomorrow. He said he was gonna take me with him, but that was two months ago. And I haven't heard anything since. I mean, he said that, right?
You own a convertible. Come on man that's, that's hot. Women love that stuff right?
The man is paying me to take Chinese.  I will say what I need to say, and soon, I will say it in Chinese.
I'm gonna tell Jim to go [Bleep] himself.
Maybe I'll stay overnight.  Got a cousin lives down there.
You mean to tell me no one wanted an energy drink for Asian homosexuals?
[taking photo with Jada] Let's see that smile. Go on. [waves to Val]
[opening door to Deangelo's office] Hey, saw Jim come in.  We meeting?
[To himself] Back for more, huh? [Gets up and walks towards Jim]
Mike. Get off of the lift. Please. Come on now.
I don't have a plan exactly. More of a loose structure. Gives me freedom to improvise. It's like jazz. [scatting] Andy don't mess with me. [continues scatting] I'll figure something out.
Um no. This is not a gym. This is like a scene out of Saw 5.
Better get some decent speakers up here then, cause we���re gonna do this right.
[on the phone] I just, no, she be talking to your mom or something. This is my daughter too, Justine! You seem to think, [Justine hangs up] oh... pick a damn tree already.
If you say so. Hey, good seeing you. Remember, I was never here. All right, then.
I don���t care, choose amongst yourselves. Not the van though.
Okay, bring it home now.  And don't forget the new black man phrase I taught you.
Hey, man, you put together a pretty fun night for everybody. I saw you talking to Hide. Did you hear that dude's life story? It's amazing, right?
And I���d only get to see Jada on the weekends. You know, I���m��� I���m not so sure I���d like living in Philadelphia.
Yeah, when are they gonna do a Labradoodle that's just Lab?
Jada don't want to spend Christmas with me. She told her mom it wasn't as much fun. And how could she say that? You know, I took her to the toy store to buy her own presents.
It's more than necessary, Mike. We need this. Roy? You still have that card from the Dockworker's Union?
You log in sales at ten different times. If you log ���em all at once, you save a lot of time. It's called batching.
I���ve been meaning to join a gym. [narrating over a montage of scenes with him and Val] For my health. I used to say I wanted to live long enough to see a black President. I didn���t realize how easy that would be. So now I want to live long enough to see a really, really gay President. Or a supermodel President. I want to see all the different kinds of Presidents.
It's cool that you like the southwest. It's one of my favorite regions.
What happens when we're done chewing? Do we spit it out on the floor, or keep it in our mouths the rest of the time?
I got too much ice cream. You want some?' 'Getting' my fry on.'
Think about it! What other mammal, besides humans, drinks the milk of another mammal? I mean, you don't see a bear drinking raccoon milk.
I have a kid. Last week, Jim at home? That was no vacation.
I'll do it better than you. I earned it. I deserve it. I got passed over, God knows why, reasons I cannot and will not understand. The job was mine Andy, everyone said it was mine. Make me manager or fire me.
Yeah, yeah me too. I think it���d be like��� You know what? [grabs basketball] I think it���d be like a Kevin Durant jump shot��� Perfecto! [shoots basketball at hoop on wall, basketball misses and lands in fish tank, killing the fish] Oh my god���
Yes, thanks to you, who promoted me, after we, uh, interfaced.
Just a hunch. Your gift is on the way.
Still good. You guys lost a pound. You lost one pound.
I didn't have time because of my daughter.
Yeah they kind of had a specific sound that didn't really fit in with our thing.
Hey, um, my daughter said you traded her a headband for her Nintendo DS?
This is the spookiest warehouse in the world, kids. You don't believe me? Just take a look. [Kevin chops into Erin, who is dressed as Princess Fiona] Oh. Scary, huh? This is a surgery with an octopus and a burn victim.
[singing] Out of paper, out of stock, there's friendly faces around the block, break loose from the chains that are causing your pain.
There's a grill in the warehouse I could bring.
Well, yeah, what can I say, a player���s gotta play.
I've been reading the comics to my daughter since she was three years old. Not once I have used the real captions to Family Circus. That crazy family is hilarious to her for one reason: me.
You got it. Pick it up. Take it out.
Then I guess I figured out where I stand. This is a love beanie.
I don't know... I thought I was enough family for my daughter.
Val knit me a beanie. But I can't if it's a ���we're just friends��� beanie or a ���I'm hot, you're hot, let's get it poppin'��� beanie. So I'm gonna up the ante, give her a clearly romantic gift, and we'll get to the meaning of the beanie.
A lot has changed since y'all left, okay? You're gonna have to jump through some hoops. And the new foreman is here. Now she's one of the best we've ever known, okay? So I need you to show her your upmost respect. Make sure she feels welcome and at home, okay? Can you do that?
Didn't have to see. It was sales. I can feel it. They are out of control.
It's getting late. I thought you guys could use a little [sets up laptop] inspiration.
Spot a cow, last person to say 'Jackson Five' has to get on its back and ride it.
���Mandate���- Always think of two men on a date. [awkward moment] I have gay friends��� I have one gay friend. [to Jim] Oscar?
There is no occasion for you to go near this stuff, okay?
You made a bad call. And I fixed it. So I'm not apologizing.
Nope. His name is Michael. [Michael makes the da dum ksch on the drumset again]
Let me tell you something, Oscar. All right, Matt's an okay dude, but he's a dummy. You guys got nothing in common.
Come on man. I'm being serious. Don't joke.
All right, fine, you know what? One o'clock.
Me and Val were going nowhere and if I'm gonna be working in Philly, I'm gonna need my freedom. So, I convinced Val to breakup with me. Here's how you do it. You say, 'What are you gonna do, breakup with me?' Like it's a joke, and then you gain a lot of weight.
You know this would not happen if we had a union.
Nobody told me what people were, alright? So...  label yourselves or take what you get.
That's big of you, man. Takes a lot of courage.
This doesn't concern you man, you need to walk away.
Okay, I'll start.  It's pretty simple really. I uh, I think I deserve a raise.  I'm scheduled to get one in six months, but I'd like that to be moved up to now.
[reads text] Come to parking lot. Crazy pigeon action?
Show business is cold. Let���s say you get a job, which you probably won���t. They���re not gonna cut you any slack. You���re meant for a job with lots and lots of slack.
[scores] Here we go. Here we go. Here we go.
2,336 pounds. Y'all need to learn some portion control.
Yeah them, and the Latin Kings... the Warriors...
I am serious, Mike.  That's a 10% raise.  That's what I want.
I didn't hire anyone if that's why you're here.
I love Jim. I love that he hooked me up with a job. It's just, he uses old t-shirts as wash rags. He doesn't wash his dishes. Apparently, they need to [quote-unquote fingers] soak... He hooked me up with a job.
That's what I've been trying to tell you, Mike.  It's serious down there.  We do dangerous stuff, man.  This is shenanigans, foolishness, Nerf-ball.  You live a sweet, little, Nerf-y life.  Sittin' on your biscuit.  Never havin' to risk it.
Tracee Ellis Ross. Daughter of the First Lady of Motown, Diana Ross.
No, that's not a good idea. I don't see that as a very good song.
Oh, yes! Yes! What'd I tell you? I knew he'd turn up [holds up an iPod inside speakers] You see that? This is the greatest night of my life.
If we sell everything but the boat, your mom should be set for about six months.
So if I started singing ���Down By the Old Mill Stream���, you couldn't join me in a three part harmony. [Andy and Officer Foley shake their heads no, Darryl begins singing] Down by the, down by the, down by the....
I got Source Code on the way back.
OK, everybody smile. Ho! You lost 31 pounds.
Well, [points at Michael] those are some awful tight pants you have on. Where'd you get em? Like Queers R Us?
You just threw a milkshake in a restaurant where they make minimum wage.
You know, I just got Limitless on my iPad. I bet I could get it on the TV.
Oh, come on, man. I thought you had something real.
I just think you���re going into this a little fast.
So, the guy shows me the deck he's built. And I'm like, 'I'll call this a deck if it'll make you happy, but this is just a porch without a roof.' [laughter, Oscar looks toward door] It was ridiculous man, it was like-you could maybe get two chairs on the thing. Two lawn chairs.
[chuckles in agreement] Huh ha! That's cool, man.
Hey. While I got you on the phone, your husband's like a sloppy, homeless hobo. Can you fix that?
I don't know. You gonna wash it? Or you gonna let it soak?
Mike, you're a very brave man.  I mean, it takes courage just to
And did your brains tell you to ruin these boxes with grease?
Ed Truck hired me. Jo promoted me. Gabe listened to me. All you've ever done is say no to me. I have ambition. And you kept me at the same level for years.
Finish the joke, Andy. What do African Americans call?
It's not just today, it's everyday. It seems like the better title I have, the stupider my job gets.
Man, you have got to be kidding me.
Why would you think a lady is me?
Mike, you can't do that. It's conflict of interest.
Hang on little ladies. You don't need this thing, I'll go grab my synthesizer. [Everyone cheers]
I think if I had parents like that I'd be trying to convince everyone all the time how great I was, too.
Hey, I think this guy playing Sweeney Todd is my plumber.
I don't wanna prank anymore. Things get real. It's not funny. I'm just gonna be good, stay in my room, go to church, try to do one nice thing per day. I do not wanna prank anymore.
Oh, Mi... ! Hey, stop the video! Michael, stop it right there! Stop it right there! That's that girl from that thing. [pointing at Redheaded Actress] I banged this girl right here. This is...
Yes! [to video screen]  Right here. You are a naughty girl!
I was rushing to fill an order.  I put the ladder up to grab a box of three hole from the top shelf.  Next thing I know, I'm on the ground and the ladder's on top of me.
My biggest fear is that someone will distract us from getting all the shipments out on time.
No. Thank you for your interest in my truck.
I've never been lucky. And I'm not talkin' about the lottery, I'm talkin' 'bout stuff like developing a soy allergy at thirty-five. Who gets a soy allergy at thirty-five? And why is soy in everything?
[looks to camera for several seconds] At least it's quiet.
[claps] That was great man. Alright, I'm out of here.
Shhh. If we don't listen to the overture, we won't recognize the musical themes when they come back later.
Hey... [sighs] You know what, I could use a breath of fresh air. Let's do it.
The winner: under 'Special Skills,' Mr. Don Feiner put 'Juggling.' [laughter]
Delivered all my furniture to Philly. Hey, keep it down, though. Nobody knows I���m here.
Alright, we're going down to my warehouse, that means we're playing by my rules. No messing with the baler and be cool in front of me and Val. We just broke up.
You feel connected to this? [hold up his back brace]
Woah-Oh! Haven���t been in one of these in forever.
Now, this is the forklift.  You need--- [Michael rattles it] You need a license to operate this machine.  That means the upstairs office workers
You ready for tonight? We gonna tear up the town?
They left you in the lurch, and if they want to jump in, it means you're almost there. You did this. Bring it home.
Mike, this is the opposite of safety.  You jump, you're gonna serious hurt yourself.
Why don���t you come along and tell him yourself?
Michael, you know you don't have to turn us all in. All you need is one scapegoat.
Looked like it. Sometimes when I'm down like this, it helps to sing the blues.
I'm not checkin' email till lunch. Four hour work week.
[in a dress shirt and tie] Like what?
I put three pallets on the truck to Blue Cross once a week. They use a lot of paper.
Oh my God, I think I see the imprint of a ring pop.
I couldn't do it. I--- I ain't that strong.  And I ain't that brave.
Thank you. 'Congratulations, Darryl. Let's get wasted.' 'Have fun today, big guy.' 'Aww, yeah. Party time. Whoo-whoop.'
Yes sir. [notices Jim's using his coffee mug]
A lot... of things.  Uh, you, uh... What about Jan?  Lovely, lovely, lovely Jan, man.  It's goin' good, right?
Look, I heard about the office. Tough break.
[on phone]It���s Darryl. Erin told me to pretend to be a cop and say your mom died.
Yes. I do remember saying something like that to you.
If we were living in Sweden, I wouldn't have to worry about this 'cause we'd have universal healthcare.
Ten people, Michael. Ten people.  Would you like to be one of them?
Hey, y'all wanna hear some loud music or something?
[feeding a squirrel] I'm giving him a peanut.
Yeah sorry, I'm just looking for a pen.
How would you like it if we booed you?
[noticing all the warehouse workers wearing homemade beanies] Wow. It's like the nation of Islam down here.
I have my daughter tonight; we're renting Charlotte's Web.
And we all know, baseball does not last forever.
Ok, so um, what's his name? All the way in the back there.
Hey, Mike, look. How bout we go upstairs, too. You know learn how the office works. We can all switch places today.
Look, I'm not down there anymore, so if the guys start making fun of you, you just, you gotta stand up for yourself.
Take it out. Pick it up. Pick it up. Pick it up. Take it out.
You know what you guys should do? Go to the bookstore at lunch. There's tons of cuties and it's easy to talk to them. 'Hey, what book is that? Cool, let's hang out tonight. Sex already? Whoa...'
All right man, don't cry.  It's cool.  I'll let you get it for $400.
I think she could... sense my sadness, and I, and I found out too late that she... she's the copy editor at the Trib.
Are you wearin' lady clothes?  Those look like lady... pants.
Yeah, ok so what, you buy 40 boxes?
You just made a good idea, a great idea.
[plays soft chords and sings]  Couldn't get outta bed today. Wish the alarm clock would go away.
And you got half a million of these? Well I gotta try it.
Hey, hey, hey. I���ll do one thing with y���all.
We are hanging out-right now. You want some more of this?
Hold up, I'm looking at my spit with a microscope.
Sometimes it seems like it was better down in the warehouse, you know?
Two years ago, Andy blamed the warehouse for a late shipment that he forgot to process. We got yelled at pretty bad. Almost lost my job, and I was mad as hell at the time. But I said 'Darryl, just wait. He's a fool. There's gonna be an opportunity. Just be patient.' [smiles]
Since Andy promoted me to assistant regional manager, I've been trying to step my game up, you know, be more productive. In fact, you know what? Let���s knock out a few more of these sound bites while we're here. [pauses] Whoa! That person has really gotten him or herself into quite a predicament.
If you don't enter them immediately, you forget. What?
Uh... [looks at camera] yes?! I was. [sits back down] Little joke!
Andy Bernard can't squirt water in his eye and act like it doesn't freak him out. But you know who can? Older Male Lab Assistant Number One.
[On phone] Hello?....Justine! [laughs] Nice surprise! How you doin' baby?....Nah. No no, I didn't win. When I got promoted I stop-...what?...Yeah. Yeah, Glenn won....Oh, you wanna call him? Yeah, you should call him, congratulate him. That'll be-...What?....Oh, his number's in your old phone. Oh, you know what? I might have it right- [hangs up] Whoops.
Aw, come on. What's the harm? [makes face] Mmm. What flavor was that?
How many people a year do you think get their arms cut off in a baler?
Andy, when I was twelve years old, we did a field trip, a lock-in at the zoo. I met this girl, I thought she was so perfect. I was in love with her. But when the sun came up, I knew it wasn't real, 'cause she was ugly and I had grown tired of her. I know you want reception today, but tomorrow you won't want to do her. She's a dog.
[freezes] Ummm��� [a moment later] Alright. Obviously y���all look really busy, and uh, I don���t want to waste your time anymore. Sorry, I just uhh��� Obviously I���m not qualified to be here man, I���m���  I���m a warehouse manager, you know���
You come to my house, bust up my trash cans, call my baby sister an ass****, and told her to eat dog food.
I have a file of applicants here. I just gotta open it, look at it, interview a bunch of guys,hire some of 'em. So I'd say we're in the early stages of the process.
Yeah, just weekends for now, but pretty soon, I���m switching over.
Uh. So I guess that was your mom who called me earlier looking for the address? Real deep voiced woman?
That stuff can come back to get you. It���s called karma. You do not want to be messing around. I got an uncle���
Come on, stay, alright? It's good for people to get to know you.
He gets condescending when he's nervous. Or when he's excited or sleepy. Not an easy person to be friends with.
Man, you can't do that stuff. You'll only find pain. When my ex-wife got into my e-mail account, she was devastated.
If this company���s going down, I wanna go down on it. With it. I wanna go down with it.
Oh, yeah, I need McMahon, Deion Branch to have big games or else I'm done.
[Singing] rub a dub dub���I got scrubbed.  ���Sup, darlin���? Everybody, this is Justine. [murmurs of hello from the group] This is Jim and Oscar, everybody.
Nothing. [pulls out a can of soda] It's mine. [Jim shakes his head] [after looking through DVR] What happened to my Tavis Smileys?
Here's what I'm gonna do, I'm calling corporate and I'm filing a complaint against both of you.
No, no, Jim. This is different. This is everything.
My summer, I, um, blew out my knee playing softball. Ended up watching CNN most of the time. I don't know how we're going to get out of Afghanistan. I hate the new assistant. He's only been here for a week, and I hate him.
Yeah, I'll say something. I think we should be acknowledging our boss, because none of us would be here without him. Robert California! [everyone toasts]
Hey, just so you know, me and you��� I don't think that's ridiculous��� Dot, dot, dot��� dot, dot.
It's not real... until your wife is on board.
What do you want, baby? We got some granola, got some cupcakes, chips, apples, pies...
How about the sales department is the sails?
I brought those in. It's my birthday.  That's some stone-cold narcissism right there.
Andy made me his consigliere. Which means Assistant Regional Manager. I guess he thought I'd be into The Godfather 'cause I'm black. Wrong! I'm into The Godfather 'cause I'm a cinephile. I like Scarface 'cause I'm black.
I feel good today. My little girl Jada? It's my turn to have her for Christmas this year. Two years ago I had her, and we had the best time. I tivoed her favorite shows, some things I've never heard of. iCarly... You know who's funny on that show? The friend with the video camera. He's got a nice way of talking.
Dude, I'm gonna be here all week, right? Five days a week, I figure I'll start slow.
Figured I look presentable. [looks Michael over] You? [Michael dressed casually in jeans and sneakers] Went a different way.
Meredith's a little cute. I'm just realizing. She got, like, a Emma Stone thing.
I can���t really picture it. Can you... get it on there. Yeah. And maybe, get the cheeks.
I've been working out. But, the problem is, I've been building muscle underneath. And that top layer hasn't burned off yet. Awkward stage.
I got my whole life to be a minority executive. I only have about a year left in these knees, though.
Yes, as a matter of fact, I uh��� [pulls booklets from his bag] I wrote some down. There you go. [passes out booklets] Wow, this guy came prepared, it impresses me! [group laughs]
2,184 pounds, for a grand total -- oh! You all gained five pounds back.
Mike, I am not having fire-eaters in a paper warehouse.
[as Jim empties thermos into trash] Nah, nah, nah. You don't have to do that.
So this is cool. I think we make a good fit. [stands up]
Nice. Do the damn thing. - Pow! [they fist bump and explode]
[leaving someone a message on his cell phone, looking very uncomfortable] Hey what's up, I just thought I'd try you. I was thinking about that story where you ran into the girl you used to babysit.
I'm done. I gotta get out of here.
Don't use his real name. George Howard Scubb. It's a devil name.
Let me get this straight. You lost all of it. All your winnings. A hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
It's one of my favorite regions? Did I just sound totally lame? No, I sounded good.
I usually watch TV during my lunch breaks. It's cool?
I know he loves his pick up truck.
No! No no no no no!  I said
Phyllis. This rain... does it make you wanna be doing something?
Mike, why do you have to control how he perceives it in his mind?
Actually, that was the sound of me eating spaghetti. But I���m gonna let them think the other thing.
I'm telling you how to do this man.
That's when somebody really gets in your face, you know, you just... start tickling them.
No, no, no, no. It's not worth it.
Seriously, that was hot. Feel like you and the newsman had a groove going.
Mike claims, we're all a family isn't that right?
[talking head] I'm driving them up for five times what I would've made at work. I thought I made a good deal. [expression changes from smiling to downcast] Then I realized I'm gonna be trapped in a truck with Mike all day.
Which entitles me to half of both of y'alls money so if you don't mind.
Maybe the grinch hid the Christmas star, and we could ask for clues, and he'll tell us if we're hot or cold.
And I fell and busted my ankle.  I'm legitimately scared for my workers.
You hired your actor friend to come here as a cop?
I like the sound of this. [looks at Dwight] Maybe one day I'll be sitting in Michael's chair. Wouldn't that be something?
Here is an old man and a goth dude... and then the old crone from Drag Me to Hell.
There were times on the two and a half hour drive when I experienced doubt. That's the thing about long drives, you know, you're always going to- this is a gay bar.
I was there. That dude is not engaged. I'm not a big believer in therapy, but I'll go into my own pocket to cover his co-pay.
Every day I have a blueberry muffin. Today, I did not have a blueberry muffin. Should have had the blueberry muffin... especially considering how incredibly superstitious I am.
[puts newspaper down] Wow. That dude is good.
No, we got a truck going out at 1:15. So, that's the busy time.
[approaches Kevin] Would you like to buy some cookies?
[in a feminine voice] Kevin can't come to the phone right now because he's busy with us.
[to Val] You know, I don't think I've ever been in this exact angle before. I was scared at first, but I like it.
Because you're not a daddy, and it's not your baby.
No, that's not as much fun. You know what?
I hope so. Think about this carefully. There's better lives than this one.
[driving truck] Hey, y'all are not gonna be playing these little private games all the way.
[Michael and Holly cautiously pass each other] There's another dolly in the truck, Mike. You could take more than that lamp.
Look you need to pick yourself up. Man up, alright? You will win this in the end. It's all about heart, and character. Be your best self.
So you sure you remembered everything for your trip?
[Dwight heads toward a strip club] Oh, no, no, no. Uh-uh.
Hey, Devil's Den is that way, we should check it out. That's where the snipers hid.
I meant dressed up compared to normal. You usually dress like a ghost-buster.
I just did, like, 35 minutes on the treadmill.
Hell yeah.  You know why?  Because that was my baby.
Darryl Philbin. Then Regis, then Rege, then Roger, then Mister Rogers.
This is not a good idea right here.
So I���m like a three year old girl in this scenario���
[on cell phone] Fourteen years.  Fourteen.  I know.  [laughing]  Ok, alright.  I gotta go.  Later.  [hangs up]
I'm just glad we're gonna try it out.
���This coupon entitles you to one free tickle monster attack���
Yeah, but I never said you had nothing to live for.
Actually, Andy, you promised me five minutes to talk about productivity suggestions���
Come on, Mike, let me borrow the hat for just a couple of hours.
How far is this place? [turns off radio]
[entering Andy's office] Hey, man. Selling cookies for Jada. Want the same as last year?
Man, we can see all your business coming around the corner, okay? You need to, you know, hide the... good thing you don't have a lot of business to start with.
Yeah, we had a few fights, I suppose.  But last night we put a lot of that to bed.  I can���t tell you what I did with my ex wife last night���. I have to sing it.  [singing] We took a shower, we were naked. We ska dap dap doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.
It was kind of mumbled, I don't know, uh, only thing I could make out clearly was 'Andy,' 'Problem,' 'Eliminate,' something. I don't know what it meant.
[singing in different tune] Out of paper, out of stock, there's friendly faces around the block, break loose from the chains that are causing your pain. Call Michael, Stanley, Jim, Dwight or Creed. Call Andy and Kelly for your business paper needs. Call Dunder Mifflin.
Oh, this is a gift, for....my man Nate here.
Yeah that's true.  You gotta call your girl, and get paid.  Show her who wears the pants in the relationship.
Everyone, we have a voluntary meeting in the conference room to discuss Erin's confidence.
Don't just take the first job that comes your way. Cause next thing you know, it's ten years later and you���re still there. Could write your obituary tomorrow, it's not gonna change.
She said her name was Brandon, I think. Your mom's name is Brandon?
I was still thinking of going back to school.
Local musician? Local legend! I used to come hear you play every week at the Deerhead.
Her.  Yes, 'her' is qualified to work a dangerous machine.  You are not.  Okay?
You don���t have to say it if you���re doing it.
What kind of chicks are you going to meet there?
I need you to sign these, we got a shipment going out.
Somebody just needs to get her attention, tell her it's not OK to do this in public.
[Pam knocks on Darryl's door] Don't come in, I'm busy. [Pam opens the door]
You want to hold me, to see how you feel?
We livin��� like rock stars. I���m about to eat free steaks with my sports heroes in 32 different cities.
Man, see... That's what I've been sayin', man. We need to do this finally.
No, that's uh. Porn. Pornography. Old lady... nasty... porn.
Okay, can you just stand right there?  [snaps camera phone picture] I gotta send some e-mails.
A car parked in the sun is like a toaster oven.
Well you lost zero pounds. [everyone grumbles]  No change.  On the bright side you gained zero pounds.
Yeah, I heard. It sounds kinda lame. [to camera] No offense. You going, Toby?
Mike, I'm very busy down here. [eats chicken]
I'll answer that, Jim. I would use it as an opportunity to teach, uh, about actions... and consequences... of actions. [Jim and Gabe stare at Darryl]
[bluesy] Da na na na na...  da na na na  na...
[clapping] You got this, Roy. [Roy begins playing and singing She's Got a Way by Billy Joel, Pam and Jim looked shocked, Phyllis and Bob begin making out]
Yeah, I'm gonna ask questions and I might not do what you say.
I'll never be sorry, not for a moment of it.
Yes, I am. Just so everyone's on the same page.
And I'm gonna play this here share the wealth card.
No, wait. You're, you're supposed to... Never mind. Da  na na na na.
Wow. Man. I hope he doesn���t regret it.
What you say, bitch? You know, you might be right.
I don't know, man. Y'all quit with a lot of confidence. I mean, it was like, y'all came up in here dancing and everybody was- [sees Val] ooh, hold on a second. [sees Brandon] Oh.
Yeah, maybe everyone move one instrument to the right?
Baby, if you���re watching this, you're not chubby, you're beautiful. Daddy's just got to sell some cookies. And we're also gonna exercise more. It's gonna be fun.
Check out this song I wrote: I'ma love you downstairs tonight... [overlapping chatter]
Damn! Jim, you got a real Facebook energy going on here man. You Zuckerberged this place out!
It's not a trash compactor!  It's a baler!
Yeah, but then they moved the panel to the same weekend and the Doc crew paid to fly us in. It was kismet.
Thank God we only had a baler to deal with.
All right so the support belt. Now this one is mine. Doesn't get much use nowadays.
Let me put my shoes on. [hangs up phone, dial tone]
I'm telling you, don't do it. I've got nothing against strip clubs, but I do have something against them at noon on a Monday. The day shift at a strip club? You can't unsee that.
Jim, I got my ass chewed out because one of your orders got messed up. And Andy, you said you drove him to the courthouse.
Oh, it works. Him and me, all right, we are crazy in love. More love than your small mind can comprehend. And we have two disposable incomes. And no kids. And we're taking our business elsewhere. [Oscar and Darryl exit holding hands]
Oh, it's nice, it's real nice. People get dressed up.
Yeah. Yeah, it���s hot. The music is awesome. And the tacos are���for real.
You're such a great friend, dot dot dot dot dot.'
Mike, this is barely more than I make.  You been here ten years, dog. [laughs]
Yeah, totally crazy. Puts me in an insane asylum just thinking about it. I'm stranded on shutter island over here.
Kill their fish, and they still hire me. That���s how you do that, baby. It���s all good, I���m ready. Y���all ready for this? [sings intro to ���Everybody dance now���, points to Pam to sing first line]
One more, yeah. [Again motions to go even higher]
Hey Val. Want a beer? It might taste better than that pool water you've been drinking.
I know Citizen Kane. Rosebud didn't explain why he was how he was, it just represented what was important to him as a child, that he missed.
Glen, could you excuse us? [Andy slams the door after Glen leaves, panting heavily]
My future's not gonna be determined by seven little white lotto balls. It's gonna be determined by two big black balls. I control my destiny. I do.
Which usually means there's clothes all over the living room.
We work the same hours as you and you just said we work a lot harder
[exits Andy's office smiling] All I need is Kevin. Dude buys more cookies than everyone combined and then some. [Kevin waves at him] When I first started selling cookies he was a relatively thin man. Not a thin man, mind you. Relatively thin.
Higher. [motions with hand to go up more]
You crushed our spirits, Gabe. Congrats. You're a big man, huh? Take a lot to destroy the creativity of a whole group of people. [notification tone] [laughter]
Mike, we're not shipping as much as we did last year.
Nothing stupid about working for yourself. Hanging out with pro athletes, getting free tickets to the games. That���s why I���m doing it.
That's sweet Mike. Let's see here. There's a chapter, called Gum. With one sentence. Everybody likes the guy who offers him a stick of gum.
It���s 30 degrees out. You drinkin��� a mildshake?
[as Cookie Monster] Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum.
No. I got some work to do. I do got big plans with this company.
Hey I'm not gonna tell you this stuff if you gonna throw it back in my face.
Ok, kids. You've all been so good and unbelievably patient so I think you are gonna get some candy!
Some freaky stuff going on. I was walking behind Gabe and I heard some things.
Okay, shush it. This was a mistake. Let's go. [Darryl and Jada leave, Ryan slowly shakes his head]
Jim was nice enough to give me his bedroom.
[Talks drunk angry] Jim, that guy. [Scoffs] You gotta stick to your word! Like when you say something to a buddy, a real buddy...what are you gonna do, lie? To your buddy? [Sighs] It's awful.
You're not as scary as Book Face, over there.
Hey, come here. You guys need to see this.
Already on it. I ordered them by their Google trend ranking so we know who to hit first.
I don't know, man, they might think we're drag queens.
This may be wrong. But there's a limit to what I would do for my child.
Everyday when I came into work, all I wanted to do was leave. So why in the world does it feel so hard to leave right now?
Well you should definitely come. The foreman always comes. Plus it's fun, you know cookies, smoked fish, alcohol, people acting stupid.
I'm sure they don't regret having their child, let's move it to the pros.
So it really bothers me when somebody comes in here speeding around on a lift, playing with it like a toy. It kind of gets under my skin.
Let me... [Jim shows him the resume again, Darryl looks at it a little longer this time] Oh. Cool. [Jim gives Darryl a thumbs-up, then looks at the camera as Darryl gets up to leave]
You feel connected to his baby over there?
That's fascinating. Tell me, what's the significance of the peach orchard, thought?
Da  na na na na.  No, no, check it out, look. Da  na na na na... want to do that?
I love it. And it���s Athleap now. And the city is amazing.
[walking by with new carpet] What... What's that?  Whatcha doing?
You know what, you're one bad text away from getting blocked.
He's not my hire, but I know who he is.
What'd I tell you about building forts in my warehouse?
Hey, man. How are you doing? I, um���I didn���t call ���cause I figured you changed the number.
[Kevin scratches cookie order form and sniffs it] It's not a scratch-and-sniff, Kev.
Well see, um... in the gang world, we use something called Fluffy Fingers.
I'll come with you, show you how it's done.
Her mom wants me to take her to mass. I guess that's something to do.
It's like she only wants to hook up when Ryan comes around.  It's gotten to the point where I get excited every time I see that little dude walk through the door.
Come on, Dwight, stop overreacting. I���m getting all my work done here. No customers have complained. Nobody even knows.
What? Wait, wait, wait? So what? This happening?
[playing video game with Jim] Oh. Come on!
Okay, I'm gonna need you to make this right or else we can't be right.
I taught Mike some, uh, phrases to help with his interracial conversations. You know, stuff like, 'Fleece it out.' 'Going mach five.' 'Dinkin' flicka.' You know, things us Negroes say.
I been selling here for five years. This is my spot.
You need to change your standard for what's worthy of a text. Ask yourself is this something Darryl needs to know. The answers almost always no.
[in the bathroom with Robert[ Yeah, I guess sometimes I have nightmares about being buried alive.
Probably shouldn't tell you this, but a lotta guys in the warehouse work multiple jobs, so... we have a place.
[in background] You have to be alert, and calm. And always careful...
What? Must���ve been another devilishly handsome debonair individual.
No, no, I���m not here actually. These donuts are part of my escape from the guys at the warehouse I didn���t say goodbye to.
[Dwight and Jim enter office] Hey, hey. They're back. [Everyone greets them]
[softly] Pieces of paper. [Jo rolls her eyes]
The guy who was in here earlier, interviewed after me, how'd he do?
That doesn't mean anything. [to Kevin] Kevin, do you want to buy cookies from me?
That sounds fun, mucking around in the dump. Wish I could go.
Hey. Hey, look, when you get done with your... [looks inside conference room] meeting, you should, uh, come to the break room. We're having a party.
One of 'em, Glenn, is starting one of those fat camps where he steals your kid in the middle of the night. Madge and a couple other guys might start a strip club, but on a boat. And Heday is investing in an energy drink for Asian homosexuals. [Andy laughs awkwardly]
[Jim puts popcorn bag in microwave] Hey, if you don't want to teach me Power Point, just say so.
Mr. Romanko, we were a day late on one of your deliveries, but two of our trucks were down for repairs. It���s very unlikely it would happen again.
It's not safe, you don't have a license.
Oh, no. I mean, I want to, I just...I don't want to force you into something you don't want to do.
No, he doesn't. [to Michael] I told her Santa would be here.
This seems like the kind of thing white people with dreadlocks do.
Whoa! That person has really gotten him or herself into quite a predicament.
I don't understand the point of a hat.
Hey!  How about instead of yelling at our sweet little Miss Kapoor over five hundred sheets of paper you get back to your desk.  Start sellin' multiple reams like a man.
Lightbulb's burnt out, so it's dark. And the heat from the backup generator keeps it nice and warm. Sometimes I think about it when I'm trying to fall asleep at home. But as far as the rest of the office goes, it doesn't exist, okay?
I just don't get it, Pam. I mean, you're a rational person.
But you want me to put it back in the truck.
So, uh... here you go. [gives resume to Jim]
Obviously you know how a gym works. So you know I���m not going to pay money for this. You want people to come to your gym? Make a real gym.
There's information here? Yeah, you're right, I don't need this.
These are very dangerous machines down here, and the upstairs workers,
Holy [bleep], what? Let me see that. It's so light. Like a croissant.
You've got a booger bubble going on there.
[fake whispers to Roy] I think he feels bad.
I asked for a list. [Dwight rides in on a tricycle, laughing diabolically] ...and a clown.
I was talking like this. [mouths words while pointing to his ear] I don't feel good about it, but he just kept calling himself a gunshot victim and it got to me.
Yeah, and then he starts tickling you. You know, pretty soon you're laughing and hugging. Before you know it, you've forgotten the whole thing. Ya'll can just go to church together... get an ice cream cone.
Usually that life is short and tragic. That's okay, right?
I saw a TLC show on Kate Walsh's home office. All corkboard.
Come on! Just show me the Power Point.
[to Val] Hey, you caught some of that?
I have no idea what his problem is, that's just my standard advice. It's good advice right?
Oh, yeah, I taught him a handshake, too.
Your friends are like Spider-man, if he had gotten bitten by a spider and then got really into masturbating.
Would it be more hilarious than Angela having a Chinese baby?
This doesn't help me. I don't respond to that kind of strategy.
[Comes up behind Jim and puts his hands on Jim's shoulders] Ah-Ha-Ha! Philly! Exciting stuff, man.
Get your own raise.  You gotta get out there and earn, son.
