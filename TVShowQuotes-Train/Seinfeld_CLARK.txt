You know, if you���re ever swamped, I could make some sales calls for you.
You know what, this is completely unnecessary.  You already won...
Congrats, Dwight.
[exhales]
Terrible.
[to Pam] Who's this guy?
One second.
What?
All right.
Hey, so I hear you���re bringing in some people to interview for the sales job?
Yeah. And, uh, Kathy Ireland signed on as the official spokes-babe of Dunder-Mifflin.
Holy [bleep].
It's a medical thing.
And then, you know, maybe just a robe to wear in between takes but I probably got one she can borrow at my place, so-
You know what, man? I deserve this job.
Do what? Get into sales? That���s what I want.
[reading] Mr. Halpert, your wife called to find out how your meeting with Yuri Big Nose went.���
Well, if I may, you���re a natural.
I, my legs cramp up! Ok, it's a circulation issue.
Women reach their sexual peak at whatever age Jan was last week. I mean it was��� like making love with a wild animal. But not like a cougar like you might think. It was uh��� like a swarm of bees. Bees that just find something wrong with every hotel room.
He calls me Clarky ���cause he���s my Dad.
OK, I don't.
I'll get that for you.
I don't want to teach you Power Point.
Hey Dwight, what's an auger used for?
Alright, so you just want to do that, and that will, uh...
So Pete was a librarian?
Here we go!
[Playing computer game with Toby] You���re looking good.
That���s just a classic no-win situation.
Women don���t despise me���
Yeah, it's quite full.  Why don't you put your hand on top of my hand.
Hey, uh, does anybody know where we throw these out?
Oh yeah. Keep talkin'.
Just say ���arms��� and ���legs,��� okay? That just���that���s the vernacular that I���m comfortable with.
Oh, Dove Men.
Hey, c-c-can you just let me out of here before whatever comes next?
Right. Yeah. But, you know, I���ve actually been working pretty hard here on a daily basis. So, I kind of feel like I���ve earned this. I mean, you know?
So we decided the best way to get ahead here is to be his cheerleaders.
[sarcastically chuckling] I loved it.
You got this, it���s all you. [as Dwight repeatedly fails and gets smacked around] Got ourselves a yard sale. Balls in face. It���s not a race, Dwight.
We gotta get a wheelbarrow or something.
So, this is how we look now. I hope you like being turned on all the time.
Yeah, good nose.
Hey, man. I don't think we've met. I'm Clark.
You'll just come over, put on little lipstick, loosen up with a glass of red wine and then we'll just run through a few stories. You know, a couple different ways, with a couple different outfits. It'd be really tasteful and it'd really help me out with Duncan... with my friend. [Erin considers] What do you say? Huh?
Just do the tutorial.
This interview���s over, and I get the job. I just Kobayashi Maru���d the whole process.
OK, boss. [quietly] Pam, you know this is ridiculous, right? Like you're smarter than this.
You didn't actually say that.
Hmm.
Alright, let���s see you do it.
All right.
A Scranton nine, but yeah, point taken. Hey, let's go out tonight and just score a couple fours huh? I mean there are no games with fours.
I'll give you a hundred dollars to wear that sweater to work tomorrow.
I can���t catch him. He���s like, 250 pounds.
What���s up good lookin���?
Uh, I guess I could give it shot.
Did you? [pushes pencil cup at Erin]
So Creed is that dude's step dad?
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Okay.  Let me feel here.
I love it.
I'm good. I..
Yes, congratulations.
Where���s the Quizno���s?
Like the time that you got drunk and, and then��� Killed those kids on their way to prom!
And then what?
Why?
When you're feeding, you want to press in like this, make your hand in a C.  Uh, does that hurt?
���And I love you, for saying that.
I���ve always been good at anything that required balance. My doctor says I have gigantic inner ears.
Mm-mm.
[connect helmet straps around Stanley���s head] That���s about as good as that���s gonna be.
I do. I love the boss���s interests.
No, I think someone could make it up. Someone with very few friends.
Dude, there is no way that Jim is just back here to hang out with Pam.
Don't do it. [takes Dwight's pen]
[Pam smiles as she watches the promo with her and Jim on the roof] Oh my god, is that you and Jim?
[sighs] You interviewing for the sales job too?
I don���t either.
Yeah, could I just have a minute to prepare for this?
Quater finals in an hour.  Hope you got some sleep cause I am going to be haunting your nightmares tonight.
Look at it this way, being a bachelor is not all bad. I mean, you've got your freedom now.
You know what Dad? Maybe you should buy me a suit. I mean, I���m going to need one right? If I���m ever going to get a ���real job��� and move my ���lazy ass��� out of your ���G.D. house���.
Any good weekend plans?
Whoa! Whoa! OK, so what's this lever do?
Hey, so all that really specific cat turd business, that was about you, right?
A gentleman doesn���t discuss such matters. Especially when the feelings of a lady are involved.
All right. We got that. That's a rap, everybody.
There���s obviously a volume discount uh, if you-
Okay. We, hey���hey, listen, listen. We are going to go discuss paper contracts for city of Lackawanna public schools, okay?
Hey, Pam, I���m going to the kitchen. You want anything?
God!
Yes! All right!
No, we got it. We got it.
If you really want to show appreciation, just give me half the commission.
Oh, wide wings, interesting.
Come on, man. I mean, did Trevor do that? Did Rolf do that?
I went Christmas caroling in March and I fertilized some bushes along the way. So, not my best night. But, not my worst night.
Hey guys.
It's starting to have this reverse effect, though, where I really do think the stuff he does is awesome.
All I���m saying is, forget about my chair. He wants the manager���s chair. And I thought you wanted that job.
Kay. [removes glasses]
Why? Isn't he just coming in to rip you a new one for being gone three months?
That���s fine with me. But be careful, it is very easy to get lost in Pete���s beautiful, dead eyes.
Screw new tractors. Guys like us, we gotta plant our seed a different way.
Stretch. Alright.
I was thinking about���
What���s with the wig Meredith?
No!
Was he like the sexy librarian?
One second.
My dad is the best hunter there is. I mean, he���s like a serial killer��� of animals. One time, he snuck up behind a sleeping deer and just sawed its head right of. It was sick! [Dwight imitates sawing and blood spurting out of his neck, then makes a dying noise]
Hi, I���m Clark.
God, if only there was any other use or situation for that kind of knowledge.
Just clap through it, man.
They got us set up with Windows 95, ��so you���re kind of dreaming here.
I���ll give it a read.
No, dude, I'm not. I'm not the tutorial.
This sucks, you know? You put in 12 grueling weeks at a company, and what do they do? They make you compete for a promotion, like an animal. You know, I thought this was an office, not the Thunderdome.
Well, I understand, but ���
Blunt?
Oh, the secondary shaft. Eeeh, oooga! [laughs]
It doesn't...  Why don't you bring your baby over here...  She's beautiful.
[whispering to Pete] Whatever it takes.
They're tasteful.
Yep.
So we can offer you matte or glossy printing-
Thanks, dude. You���you sure it���s okay? ���Cause you���re kinda���
X-Men school?
Okay.
Aw, come on.
I would love a corn dog.
We can���t just leave him bubble wrapped like this.
You gave him three shots.
[confused] I sure was. Just like he taught me, looking cool.
Come on in.
There you go, good for you.
No, I prefer Fart.
Yeah, I���ll just give it a glance���
Wait! Wait. Hold on. Where���s the band? ���Cause there���s just no way you guys are making this magic with just your mouths.
Hey, can I talk to you for one second?
Jeez, you fell in love with that hair? Really? [laughs] Yikes. That is awful.
Wha���What���s a shank?
I am!
All right, Jim, look, I just got made junior salesman. Right? And���and Wallace is here today. And I don���t him to just think of me as a customer service rep that sits in the annex. I mean, you can get that, right? Right? And what do you need more face time with Wallace for? You trying to get a second second job here?
That���s a little weird.
Isn���t the client, like, best friends with his sister?
Hey, wait, wait, how���how are we doing this?
Come back.
Dude, we're being conned.
The same thing that you think.
That���s actually really smart.
Uh, I don���t know yet.
Is this���is this like code for gay stuff? Cause if so, that���s totally fine. Like, I���m fine with it. But you should know that I���m into the ladies.
And you can just...  The baby should grab on to that.
Nope, you got it. You fixed it. Uh, I have a gift from Jan. It���s an espresso maker! We came to be quite fond of espresso on the Amalfi Coast so��� bon appetite.
Well, my only crime was loving the local sports teams and trying to be one of the guys.
No, we sure hadn���t Pop. [both chuckling]
It's porn.
[talking on phone] Duncan, listen, I would love to help you out but where am I gonna find somebody that's pretty, smart and well-informed? Huh? Hold on, hold on. [covers phone's receiver] Erin, do you know anybody that might want... [has realization] Oh my gosh. You love the news, right?
So I���d Kobayashi Maru it.
So you guys all know Dwight already?
[sighs]
So could you give me a list of all your clients? Or just the leads that you haven���t had time to pursue yet?
Darryl, you know, I would love to just record some of your stories, just let the tape roll for six or eight or ten hours and just see what we get.
You know what, Dwight?
He's looking for on-air talent and he'd kill me if I didn't get you on tape.
[emotional] Do you have any idea what I had to do to get that sale from Jan? I mean, I went all out. All out. I mean like everything was out the whole week.
Perfect height, yeah.
Yeah. In the European billboards, she's gonna be topless.
Mmm.
Great, now we got three hours to fill.
Alright, that���s enough, ���cause I can say some things about him too.
Kay.
Learning what?
So how���d you guys hear about the position?
What lines?
Well, uh��� see, you raised it.
Driving.
Yeah.
She's living a lie.
Hey, Dwight.
Yep, she's done.
Pff. Guess I'll just head over to the mall then. Buy Erin some sexy, fun outfits.
These chicks are way too hot to be into us.  Esther's just pretending to like you so that you'll buy her daddy a new tractor.
God, one of my buddies is going through the same thing right now. Something in the air.
Oh.
Uh... couple of button-downs, a camisole, a blazer, a pencil skirt, stilettos, maybe, no, no, not maybe, definitely open-toed. Uh, something low-cut because the camera makes everything seem higher cut.
It's what I do. [everyone begins to leave]
Right. Well, I���m here to sell paper.
Damn it.
Yeah. Star Trek rules.
Nice.
If it���ll lead to me being a salesman, I���ll pretend to be your friend.
Let���s talk.
We've still gotta work together, so we should keep it civil.
Ok.
I don't even know what an auger is!
Okay, well.  Feel how I'm flicking the nipple?  Like that?
Wintergreen.
I am.
Well, that���s better than looking like the undertaker from boring island.
Packer laced the cupcakes.
[answers his door to find Erin, Andy and Pete] Hey! Everybody.
My mistake.
Are you guys high? Because if so, to speak my truth, I would appreciate the sacrifice of including me in some hits off your kind buds.
Dude, this size of my haunches��� [Stanley���s body slips down the stairs and his head thumps into a wall]
Well, you know, I���m also Customer Service.
Dwight, for the last time, she���s not a waitress.
Rolf Ahl? Sounds kinda like Roald Dahl.
Why?
What?
There he is.
What, am I overdoing it? No. No.
[Pete looks on disappointed] Ok.
I scored Stone and Son Suit Warehouse with you, and God knows, to get the Scranton White Pages with Jan, I went above and beyond��� and under.
That���s how you do that! Whoo!
Is he gonna be okay? I mean, weren���t those darts intended for an animal, like, two to three times larger than him?
Come in.
[enters] Here you go, Pop! I know it was just a couple minutes, but��� God I missed you!
Well, I got a buddy that's a big time local news producer and I can't tell you his name, but it'd blow your mind.
Oh, I���m sorry. You gotta be this cool for coffee.
[catches on] Ha ha! I just burned him. Because the truth is��� our relationship is��� terr-
[emerges from dressing room wearing a sharp black suit] How do I look?
Hey, how was the singing show audition?
You were in the shower or he was in the shower?
[to Pete] What're you doing here?
Yeah.
You just let it all hang out, that's what...
Stimulate it.
Oh, you guys think this is funny? You know what? No more discount. [to nail manager] Excuse me. [gesturing he and Nellie] Full price. We're not together.
What's her name?
