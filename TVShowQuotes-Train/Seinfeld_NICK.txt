(quietly angry) All morning I been waiting here. All morning.
We can fix that. We can fix that.
(still angry) The guy says he's gonna be home. I show up and all I do is wait. I'm getting pretty sick and tired of it. I'm not gonna put up with it much longer.
Yeah, this is Nick Stevens, from Plaza Cable.
I was there. Where were you? You think I got nothing better to do than stand outside all morning, waiting for you to show up?!
(weary) Alright, I know you're in there. I know you can hear me. You win, okay? You win. I can't do it any more. What d'you want from me? Apology? Alright, I'm sorry. There, I said it, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I see now how we made you feel when we made you sit home waiting. I dunno why we do it. (upset) I guess maybe we just kind of enjoy taking advantage of people. (reasonable) Well, that's gonna change. From now on, no more 'nine to twelve', no more 'one to five'. We're gonna have appointments. Eleven o'clock is gonna mean eleven o'clock. And, if we can't make it, we're gonna call you, tell you why. (worked up) For god's sakes, if a doctor can do it, why can't we? (almost sobbing) Anyway, that's it.
Uh, the thing is, we happen to have a man right in your neighbourhood.
Oh, right. (laughing it off) I'm sorry, I was looking at the wrong work order.
Hey, uh, you know the guy who lives here?
If you see him, Could you just tell him the cable company was here?
Hi, uh, excuse me. I'm uh, I'm with Plaza Cable. I'm sorry to bother you. I...I'm looking for the guy who lives over here. Been waiting about uh, heh, two hours. You uh, happen to know where he is?
(yelling after the fleeing Kramer) I'll get you! I'll get you Kramer! You won't get away with this!
(inexpertly disguising his voice) Hi, uh ah, Mister Kramer, ah, this is McNab down at the phone company. We've got a report about some trouble on your line.
