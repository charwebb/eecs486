Aaand if you could just sign this one as well, Mr. President. 
Believe it or not, her name is Jennifer Lopez
Hey! How about the elementary school orchestra? They had a great version of Mary Had a Little Lamb at their last concert.
Arrest that woman! She wants to kill one of our artists! 
Well, she lives in South Park, Colorado now, but uh I believe she originally from Mexico, just like you.
If they're working in a sweat-shop that is.
We wanna thank you for all your hard work and ..."talent".
We do, however, have an official statement for all the concerned cities about the matter with the giant snake that we can't seem to put out.
All right, Ms. Lopez, take it from the top. 
And what do we do about the small town of South Park that lies in the highway's way?
Better yet, it's a chance for you to get some publicity.
Who knew? I always thought he was a complete idiot.
Ms. Lopez, you were due in the studio two hours ago! Come on! 
Uh, ladies and gentlemen, the Mayor of South Park regrets that she cannot be here herself, but she isâ€¦ sick.
Stephen! Stephen! A call came in from the United States! They want to talk to you aboot ending the strike!
Surgeon general, twelve more FedExes have been taken over; the Pissed Off and Angry Party is gaining more support!
How come they never mention anything about us?! When are they gonna get to the strike?!
