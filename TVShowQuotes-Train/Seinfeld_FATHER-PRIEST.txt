I must say George, I was somewhat surprised at the results of your conversion test. I dont recall having seen such an impressive performance. You truly must be filled with the spirit of the Lord.
Yes, yes I will help you. Listen very carefully. I want you to buy ten cloves of garlic, three quarts of vinegar, six ounces
Well whatever it is, basically you like the religion.
Why do you want to accept the Latvian Orthodox faith?
You may attend to it Sister, oh this is George Costanza. He is interested in joining the church.
Yes, yes I see. (To George) Im sorry something has come up.
Congratulations George. Welcome to the faith. Sister Roberta would you please offer the final benediction.
The first step would be to familiarize yourself with these texts (brings out a pile of books).
No, Sister Roberta is not a nun. She is what we call a novice.
It is a Latvian word which means "the lure of the animal".
Yes. Please, sit down. Sister Roberta came to see me yesterday.
