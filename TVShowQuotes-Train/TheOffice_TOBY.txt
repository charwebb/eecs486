I remember.
What... you can't... Gabe? Are you...
That may have been my fault.
Is everything okay?
No.
You know this sounds a lot like the premise of my latest Chad Flendermen novel. A murder for framing.
No.
Um, yeah.  You're computer screen can be a big strain on your eyes, so uh, it's also recommended that you step away for about... about ten minutes every hour.
What?
I could, sure. Have a seat. I would start at the beginning, but I think I need to go farther back.
Wow, I'd love to take a look at that.
Did you bring your passport with you?
Sedentary.
Uh... it's true...
You really did it...
What? I was just explaining--
No.
You know they're teasing you. I mean... obviously, this is... a much nicer place than an actual prison. We get paid to be here. We go home afterwards and have social lives. We have... we have parties here. They're teasing you. To be funny.
All right, now Oscar's feeling discriminated against by his co-workers, primarily Angela, and um, that's your fault.
Actually, I didn't think it was appropriate to invite children since it's... You know, there's gambling and alcohol, and it's in our dangerous warehouse and it's a school night... And, you know, Hooters is catering. You know, is that enough? Should I keep going?
I'm sorry.
I���m just curious though, what do you have against Pete and Erin?
No, you hit the road, jack.
Uh, well, we probably don't want to go just on seniority.
Come on Dwight. We went over this, like for a half an hour.
Oh, really good.
Oh, no, no. no. My plane just got in. From New York. Are you still with Piotr?
Um... You might want these orientation materials.
Look at.. Look at me. [laughs]
[tossing forms at Michael] Just fill them out any way you want.
No, uh... [shouts] Does anyone have a camera here? [no one answers him] No one has a camera here. Uh...
No, why would I punch you?
Where?
What?
They would just send someone else. You need to have an HR representative.
Uh-huh.
Which is where?
And Pam Beesly.
Yeah. So anyway, the entire jury wants me to vote guilty. But then I did a little research of my own, and forget everything you thought you knew about fingerprinting.
Give you a name or-
Well, as you know, Ed Truck passed away. So, I'm here to talk about it if anyone would like to.
Hey, this came with the Stamford book. [Sets down box that says: Personnel Files Stamford CT Office Confidential] Can you take care of it?
I'm gonna... I'll go get one. Stay. [runs out of the office]
It's probably okay...
Did you?
I don���t... I don���t...
Didn't you lose a lot of money on that other investment, the one from the email?
Write your own damn novel.
Yeah, maybe when you get really comfortable with each other, you can ask for that.
Hey I need to talk to you right now.
Hookah is not an illegal drug, Michael.
I didn't put caprese salad in my drawer, Michael.
Believe me, she has enough toys... she doesn't need your watch.
We can do this with more privacy.
Really, really funny.
Course you do.
Michael?
[to Jan] He talked the whole time.
It's just a little dispute over a poster in their workspace.
...minor points.
[in a hospital bed, watching Entourage in Spanish] Oh, I went zip lining my third day in Costa Rica.  I guess the harness wasn't strapped in exactly right.  I broke my neck.  And, I've been in the hospital five weeks now.  I still haven't seen the beach.  It's nice to have visitors.
You know, Michael, sometimes my daughter's stomach hurts when there's a mean girl at school...
Yeah, Michael asked about it once. I just pretended not to hear him. He left.
Yeah. Yeah, I don���t think���
Fine, I'll take your name off. [looks at Michael] So no one will know.
Uh, yes!
I know, um, but Ryan thinks that, uh, they're not good enough.
[nods] ...You know, I, uh, I know a little about what you're going through in a way. Um, when I was a kid, my parents got divorced. They both wanted custody, and they both asked me to testify against the other one in court. So, I don't know, I didn't want them getting divorced in the first place you know? I loved them both so much. I just wanted... [Michael pushes Toby's food tray off the table and walks off]
Hey.
Um, if, uh... um... I just completely forgot what I was going to say. It's so weird.
on our policy.
Um, why don't you go ask him that?
You can't claim territories. This is the only place I interact with people. Can't you sell at your church or barber shop? [Darryl looks hurt] Or chess club, or?
Andy, you know I can���t do that. It���d be lying.
Colorblind.
Been to Amsterdam.
...using her own money...
Well, it... there was. But Michael scheduled it for 4:58 on a Friday. You know, people sang in the parking lot.
I'm sorry, if we did something to upset you, I'm sure it was inadvertent.
Hi, Kevin. Look, I need to talk to you about-
Do- Well you should give him a little time to settle in. But-
Yeah, the ball-throwing exercise is in the binder. It's in the section marked, 'Fun Ways To Make Brainstorming Sessions Explode With Excitement and Creativity.'
Hey.
A guy on my street fell off a ladder painting his house.  It was on the news.
Oh my goodness, look. Look at this.
[sobbing] It���s everything.
[to Kevin] Honestly, is there any way you can get on your fiancee's plan? Our health plan is s... just... it's terrible.
[hugging Nellie] So proud of you, Hon.
Uh, we're on recess. I came for the party. Hey, everyone.
Oh, Jesus!
Oh thanks.  She's gonna... [notices the doll is black] oh...
Thanks.
This is Jim Halpert...
So this is H.R. This is your desk.
Here's how I usually handle this: all I do is listen.
Oh, it wasn't camping, it was more of a wilderness retreat. [Michael walks in]
He didn't seem like he was joking.
Yeah.
Okay, you get a one-second hold on the ball...
Uh, no, the opposite. I was actually selected to be a juror on a very high-profile case.
Oh, yeah, no, it���s okay. I can handle it. Um, so���
Ok, I mean, I could talk to her.
What are, are you doing at my desk?
Well, as you know, Dwight has filed a lot of complaints against you over the years.
Miami University in Ohio. On her last day, Kelly was still a little confused about it
My birthday was two months ago.
Dwight, you cannot keep that here.
You'll see.
It's an EMF hotspot.
Um, yeah, ah, ah, that means a lot.  Thank you for saying it.
Apparently you called Oscar 'faggie' for liking the movie Shakespeare in Love more than an action movie.
I want to introduce you to...
Michael.
You know, why don't we split the order? It's only fair.
Hey, Andy, Nobody's calling you crazy, Andy. We're your friends, Andy.
What's something that you...
Good morning, Kelly.
It's, uh... I was... might ask if you wanted...
Christmas.
Michael!
Okay, that is fine to feel, but not to act on.
Okay, look, in a real crisis situation, you���re not gonna have to time to think, okay? So just remember, I-A-A-T-G. ���It���s all about the groin.���
I'm not going to punch you, Michael.
It's digital, so just take as many as you want.
I like to think Lloyd Gross is a no-nonsense guy who doesn���t back down from anybody. And he calls people ���Kimosabe���.
So it's like volleyball.
I'm just saying I don't think it's appropriate for you to have given Ryan that award.
I don't know. No.
Oscar says I checked out huh?  Huh. [nods head]
Oh, there's a whole 'nother terrorism booklet for that.
Hey, is that Michael?  Does he miss me?  [laughs]  Uh, Oscar?  Are you there?  Hello? [sighs]
No, no.  Um, you always want to keep a sweater or cardigan of some sort, in case it gets drafty.
You���re really there to talk to each other. I would say that the therapist is more of a facilitator.
The lady cop acted like she'd never pulled someone over for driving too slow.  And I tried to get out of it with the famous Toby Flenderson 10,000 watt smile. [smiles] It didn't work.
Who brought in donuts?
No it's not. It's a type of pipe. You can fill it with tobacco, often mixed with fruit, or other flavors.
You know what Michael? You're right. You win. This is pointless. We're not getting anywhere. I got a bunch of fun stuff, in case my daughter ever comes over. Why don't we just run out the clock by playing games, drawing some pictures, talking?
Um... nothing comes to mind. [clip montage]
Oh, uh, I don't know, uh...
I have very fertile hair glands.
I'm going to the prison. This afternoon. I'm gonna talk to the strangler.
Wish it were true, but it, it uh, seems from that photo that you took, you've entered into an intimate relationship.
I'll have Erin fax them back to corporate.
Well let me see... I would, uh...
���..Chad Flendermen's kryptonite. [Darryl walks up to Toby and Val in a tuxedo]
Yeah, um... I can���t believe you remembered. I do self-defense. Um, I���ll go put on my cup.
Angela, what do you want me to do?
Ok, look the memo is not about you...
Uh... wow....
Ohh.
In meetings.
Oh... uh...
[Michael hands him a present] Wow, thanks, Michael, I...
[to Sasha] Come on.
All right, come.  Sit down, Dwight.
[standing in the church sanctuary, talking to the stained glass] Why you always got to be so mean to me?
I guess I shouldn't have stopped for dinner.
The Scranton strangler. George Howard Skub. Haven't I told you about the jury I was on a couple years ago?
Yes.
Are you gonna kiss me?
I know right?  I just want to go, and look at art, and swim in the Adriatic.
Hey, um did you go to uh, Bishop O'Hara?
Morning.
Jan told me just a few minutes before she told you.
Blah blah blah blah. Jim.
Michael?
Looks like we kicked it. [indicates water jug is empty]
I can refer you to someone to talk to.
No.  It's even-- it's even better than the one I wanted.
Forcing your employees to set you up is not a, uh, uh, technical violation of any Dunder Mifflin rule.  You know, but neither is forcing them to help you with a shot-by-shot remake of Indiana Jones.  Huh-how do you make a rule book like that?
Look, you know, in any company  there's going to be certain degrees -
Unless part of you made that mistake on purpose.
Hey guys that's really inappropriate.
Hey, what's going on? There's a police car in the...
The simple solution would be to open a window... if we had... windows that could open.
Okay.
No, no, no. It's not fair. What if Kevin wants to buy cookies from me?
Yeah.
No, no.
So you set him up.
Have a great day!
You know, I actually lived in Honolulu for a year.
Ok, I can't count the hour if you don't talk.
Anybody need sun block? Got SPF 30.
I love their sandwiches.
Come on, Michael. You're interrupting.
[sighs and pulls out a box under his desk] It's all Dwight's.
Aren't the suggestions meant for you?
Well, you know, 'cause of  the trains.
Okay, I think we should probably be okay.
[in feminine voice] And this is Sam.
Well, we did a little investigation and Dwight had a good point.  The ladder didn't reach the top shelf.  I don't know if I believe it, but I am a fan of the hardboiled detective novel.  [impression] I'll punch you in da mush, see.
[walks in] Hey, Jim.
It has been a long, lonely winter.
[after awkward pause] Sh, uh, um, I was having this separate conversation with Kevin. Uh, Johnny Depp.
Robert did say you'd be joining us. Welcome. I'm Tony.
All right, well, let���s try one simple technique together. Okay, why doesn���t everyone stand? Okay, so... you���re being attacked. You���ve got your hands up. Simple palm strike to the chin. Up to the chin. One, two.
He has a doctor's note.
I w-, uh, I would love to give uh-
Heh.
I-- I don���t know if there���s truth to-- to, uh, to that.
Ah, you should probably deal with that outside of the work place.
This is a bloodbath. Alright, I���m calling this.
Actually, I have a separate folder for complaints against Michael. This [unlocks a drawer]is January through March of this year. [pulls out a fairly large folder]
[laughs] Oh man, thanks, thank you, [tearing up] thank you, thank you.
Erin, HR is a joke. I can't do anything about anything.
Great.
Get over there!  Get over there!
Yes.
Oww.
I don���t think that���s very common.
Well, I was hoping that maybe in light of everything that's happened today, it would be a good idea if today, you, me, and Michael could head into the conference room for some conflict resolution.
Every Friday at 4, I have a standing appointment with Dwight for him to file a grievance against Jim. I tell him that I'm sending them to a special file in New York. That box is the special file in New York.
Alright, I wasn't expecting that. Let's uh... let's go draw.
[Michael and Holly are still working on the chair] What'd you guys do?
Okay, okay, I'm going.
This may be the first time that a male subordinate has attempted to get a modest scheduled raise by threatening to withhold sex from a female superior.  It will be a groundbreaking case when it inevitably goes to trial.
I could loan you a pair of socks.
I can go over it with you.
Good luck.
Great.  Because you that I think the very fact that [Michael mutes the call]
You can't do that.
[laughs out loud] Excuse me.
Hey, Stanley...
I've been drafting a letter.
Ah, pretty good. I finished.
You mean food truck. Ernesto's was a food truck.
Hey, what happened?
I'll call.
No, I mean he's attracted to other men.
Hi! [goes to hug Nellie]
Yeah, I could say something.
I was...
Come on.
You know it���s not just pregnant women who don���t get their due. You know who���s gorgeous? Helen Mirren.
You know, sometimes I wish we just didn't have a conference room. [Kelly laughs] You know? He couldn't do that.
Radiant.
Michael, do you have the name of the employee you're letting go? I'd like to start working on out-placement.
Hello! [laughing] Hello!
He seems fine to me.
How are you? Hey. Welcome back. [puts out fist to bump]
Don't search my stuff.
Pam, can I talk to you for a second?
What?
Yeah, could we...
I made it this far, right? What's the point?
No.
I'm not processing this.
Now, if your attacker is willing to defile a corpse, you better stop playing dead right away and just make it known that you���re alive.
There's some right there.
Michael is like a movie on a plane.  You know, it's not great, but it's something to watch.  And when it's over you're like... how much time is left on this flight? Now what?
I did leave.
Uh... it... compliment...
It's, uh, it's HR stuff.
All right... sorry... sorry about that.
Just letting Oscar vent a little. We would use the break room, but the photographer's back there today.
Pete���s a pretty cool guy, though, and Andy was a terrible lover to Erin. He basically ignored her and left on a boat.
No.
Yes.
Does it have to be pizza? Could go for a, falafel?
[standing behind Erin] I don't think this fax is going through. Is there a different... I can just put it through again, you know.
Alright, well then you can ask about religious beliefs.
Talk to Michael. I gave him the box.
If we don't patronise the only Syrian restaurant in town, there'll be nothing left but pan pizzas and make-your-own salads.
I knew it. I knew it from the beginning it was possible.
Oh, hey, Bert. Wanna see the dance? Dem bones, dem bones, dem dry...
He's gonna ruin everything.
[singing and dancing] Dem bones, dem bones, dem tired bones, now we're the skeleton crew.
I'm makin' great time. Usually I have to take a bathroom break half way through a race like this, but not today.
Well, I do. Always ready for adventure.
Johnny Depp.
[chuckles, snorts]
[on phone] Hey Sasha, it's daddy.  Have you ever heard of this doll , Princess Unicorn?
No not really...
A few years ago, when I was on the jury of the Scranton Strangler..
It happens, okay? Uh, so let's just find an empty desk for you, and uh, I'm sure Robert will be with you as soon as he gets in.
I don't think Michael intended to punish me, by putting Ryan back here with Kelly.  But, if he did intend that?  Wow.  Genius.
Concentrating? Is anyone having trouble getting their work done today?
I'm sorry.
Uh, I just wanted to let you know that, uh, I'll be taking a leave of absence starting next week.
Thanks, I'm gonna set it to Costa Rica time.
Now, we���re actually a lot closer to Binghamton than you are. Kimosabe.
[mimes lifting a glass] To Amsterdam.
Andy?
[sighing] Look, it's a free country. If she wants to throw a party...
Ryan invited me to go on his wilderness adventure retreat. It was this amazing, beautiful experience [Michael knocks on the window behind Toby from outside]
Yes.
Except you just told me you were gonna make it up. Now if she sues, I have to testify against you.
Uh, ok.
Cause Ryan asked me to talk to you.
This is a picture I've been carrying around in my wallet for about six years.  It's this unspoiled beach in Costa Rica, Playa Grande.  Um, I take it out when I get stressed or depressed, and it really calms me down.  Never thought I'd get to live here, you know.  But it turns out they built these great new condos there, so, this could be me, right around, uh, where the trees used to be.
I... guess I forgot.
I don't know how I'm going to get through this. I don't want to lie and I DON'T want to tell the truth.
Technically, he's right.
Oh. [laughs nervously]
We even go to lunch, pick up babes.
Michael, can I talk to you for a uh, second please?
[whispers] That they do.
I'm... here, Jan.
I'm running this meeting.
Hey! [extremely loud gunshot]
[excitedly] Oh, I should get the accident report binder. I've never used the gun violence forms before.
Um... in fact, basic rule of thumb, let's just act everyday like Pam's Mom's coming in. All right. That's it. Um... if anybody has any questions about anything, you know where I sit in the back.
Well, we still have to do the exit interview.
Hi guys.
Happy birthday!
OK, I am telling you, Oscar is an actual homosexual.  Yeah, he told me this morning.  And, obviously he hopes he can count on your discretion.
Yes, that's true. I have never won a Dundie. I am more than okay  with that.
No.
Uh... Human Resources.
Ah, this reminds me of the HR convention last fall.
Really? You were gonna throw out a book?
[walks in] Hey everyone.
Michael, we are only allowed to talk about Meredith's work performance. We can not ask her to stop drinking.
What are you talking about?
[walks up to Pam's desk with a binder] Hey Pam, could I talk to you for a sec?
I might have it in here.
Thanks Kelly.
Y'know I've been going over my notes from the trial...
That was the right decision for me and my marriage.
Kelly Kapoor is gone. Her fianc�� Ravi was hired as a pediatrics professor at Miami university.
Good morning.
No, nah.  I don't see it.
Well, that would be...
Come on, Dwight. Get out of here.
Michael Scott, this is Holly.
[spying at Darryl's house] Sounds like a EMDP-40.
What?
Hey Michael.
You think I have a machine for measuring bee hives?
I don't report to you, Michael. I report to the head of HR in New York.
Second?
[whispering] I am not doing your dirty work for you.
What do you mean?
To madness. [Robert laughs]
Hey, text from the old wife. Gonna take that. [runs outside]
If you turn out the lights we'll do a little dance.
No.
Yeah, it's great, isn't it?
Hey, Jim.
Oh, sure.
Michael's behavior is erratic and unpredictable, but I don't think he's doing drugs. Maybe he should. Take the edge off. Uh, not at work, of course.
Yeah.
He said that?
Hey, Brenda.
Somehow.
Why wouldn't it--
Do you see David Wallace in the room right now?
...and, yeah, the whole thing was incredibly cathartic.
[opening kite from Ryan] Wow! Cause... [reveals Kite Runner book]
50?
All right, look, what you gotta understand is that when you come to work, you give up certain rights.
Michael, this is really inappropriate to talk about.
Not much? What's up with you? [from bathroom above] Nah it's okay. I'm in the bathroom. Hey you been watching Damages this year? It's so good. No, you gotta tune in, it's as good as anything on HBO. [sound of pissing] Hey does blue go with tan?
Well thanks Michael.
Thanks!
Yes.
Well, you know, Stanley was openly insubordinate.
I-I think we hang out an appropriate amount of time.
Its really sad that your dog ran away. Why did it keep you from going to the park?
I don���t...
How will your experience selling refinery equipment translate to our smaller scale here?
Yeah.
Yeah.
It wasn't a vote. You decided.
I just want to...
Oh, I don't know.
That was... I went to Costa Rica for a few months.  What is going on?
Kevin.  His gambling problem must've resurfaced. I'm gonna have to send him home until I can do an investigation.
So, her husband, your stepdad?
Yeah.
Did you guys do much stuff together?
Oh my God!
I don't think laughing about it is an appropriate response.
It's a finicky car...
So Dwight and Darryl came to an agreement that both would file complaints with corporate and now I get to do all this paperwork.  We worked it out.
Okay you know, this-- this is over.
Sure.
Yeah.
Yeah, well... Not everybody has what we have.
That���s true. There���s no rule. You can check the employee handbook. Oh, can I check the employee handbook Lloyd? Well, does it say anything about me choking a man with my bare hands?
What?
Just preparing for the deposition.
You're welcome.
I was-- I was gonna get the doll.
The more the merrier.
You just got your corporate credit card back. Do you really want me to take it away again?
Two dimes, seven nickels--Well, okay, no, that doesn't add up. It was one quarter and--
I have like, like a blue shirt? I don't wear a lot of colors, I have a lot of tan. Uh huh.
Hey, what's going on?  You don't have my permission to do this.
Well, we could try him out for a little while... [Jim drops his pen, looks exasperated] and if it doesn't work out, you know, maybe one of us could, you know, step in...
Damn it.
About seven.
Hi, do you mind if I sign the card real quick?
Well, I don't see it that way.
These things just have a way of working themselves out.
Well, um, it was amazing.  It really was, thanks for asking.  Um the beaches were pristine...
Oh, you guys. Kelly called it. 2013. So s���hey! Hey! Hey, no! No! Get outta here. Clark, get outta here.
It was actually kind of hard to meet people I found.
Well, I am trained in grief counseling, but, ahh, I don't think that's what they need right now.
Michael, We should contact some experts.  You don't know what your doing.
Just to refresh you... .
Yeah, um, but now apparently Darryl has some issue with his...
Hi, Micha-
Hey.
Um, ex-wife. Yeah. Um, her last name is 'Becker' now.
Yeah, it just means whoever complained came to me later and withdrew it, so I took their name off.
Hey, want my sun screen?
Hey Dwight. Pretty nice robe- [Dwight grabs bag with robe in it and walks away.] Why?
You can't, [Michael touches his forehead and makes sizzling noise] Ow. Look, you cannot push religion.
Well, you know how everyone fast forwards through ads these days? Well, what about an ad in slow motion. You know, if they fast forward through it, it'll just seem normal and it will catch your eye. Plus, uh, the slogan could be: Dunder Mifflin, we adapt to the pace of your business. [murmurs of approval by everyone but Michael]
...bones. What?
Well, you can actually fire him.
[alone in cab} After Dwight fired me, I moved to New York to write the great American novel. I have six roommates. Heh. Which are better than friends, you know ���cause they have to give you one month���s notice before they leave.
Not really.
Toy Story 2, one of the best movies I ever saw. I went for my daughter and stayed because you can't leave your daughter in a theater.
That really hurt. I'm writing you up. [Angela makes an angry face] Hey, you are not allowed to touch other employees. Am I being clear?
We should stay to maybe some more traditional models...
Nothing.
Oh, no, I-- no, no, I was gonna buy that doll.
There was no party.
Frustrating.
Where are we?
So remember, intent is irrelevant. And that's it. Pam?
Let's just wait.
Lady...you never stop surprising me.
But why?
I can���t.
I wouldn't want to do that now would I?
And uh, yeah, plus it was hot.
Yes.
Sorry guys, but I don't think I tipped him for last year's.
Eighty-nine.
I have a reasonable right to privacy.
No. They���re just regular men.
Alright.
That's not a very good Darryl.
He- he can't do that.  Turns out she's allowed to have feelings of sexual arousal.  It doesn't become a violation until she physically acts on it.
Well, I don't think there's any reason to check 'em but I suppose if we wanted to be really certain...
Here. [hands Pam a duck stuffed animal]
Well you know Michael, I have a brother in Boulder. Rory Flenderson. You should look him up.
I--I could--I could talk about it.
Well, good.  We can, uh, throw that one out. [shuffles through papers]
It was Ryan wanted Michael, the subject, to explain the computer system, the object.
Why?
Oh my god.
No, no, no, no, no. Women chase him. He misses his wife.
Thanks... [Hank is standing next to Michael] Really, Michael?
Oh, wow, this is, uh, just a mystery novel that I've been working on.
I mean, what���s the end date? It must be really hard for her to sign on to be unhappy if she doesn���t know when it���s gonna end.
Yeah, hey.
Why?
[on the phone] It was terrible.
Uh, about a week. Er... .um... .maybe a month. I uh can't...
I just though you could add me.  I don't see the harm in that.
Oh, Michael, you can't ask about religious beliefs...
Andy, it's not the original. And destroying it will not stop them from dating. Andy. [Andy throws paper at him and leaves, Toby straightens paper out] It's the original.
Hey, Meredith.  Can I talk to you privately for a second?
Oh well, you know, those were only for, you know [makes quotes with fingers] relationships, so... if, if this is just a casual thing, there's no need, really.
Guys, I think Michael and Luke are related.
Well, look, sometimes things crop up later. So, uhh, you should know I'm always available if anyone would like to talk.
Is anyone having any trouble eating?
Maybe you could just take the rest of the day off... you know...
No, no,... no. Sorry. We cut Kevin off for the same thing. You have to have something to say, if you talk. [Angela rolls her eyes and stops talking]
Fun?
See?
Yes.
More like 'Everyone let's get your boss laid Saturday.' [more laughs] [Toby puts his hand on Pam's knee, everyone stares, Toby removes his hand] I have an announcement uh, to make. I am moving to Costa Rica. Thought about it for a long time now. And I'm finally gonna do it. So, I'm just gonna hop the fence and jog home now. [runs out of lobby and climbs the fence and jogs away]
I don't know.
[entering Andy's office] Knock, knock. Hey, Sasha's first year in the troops, so I'm selling cookies for her. Anyway, would you like some?
I normally do nothing, I guess. No, you shouldn't- [Holly knocks on Michael's door]
Hey Dwight.
So, how would you go about settling interpersonal conflicts within the office?
We can play something more complicated if you like.
How would we get home?
Oh... yes.
Alright, well look. While I have you here, this is a relationship disclosure form for Pete & Erin.
Yeah, I guess it will be my, uh, thing in Costa Rica, be a nature photographer.
Say Anything, The Shining, Annie Hall, that's too obvious.
It���s interesting that you���re drawn to the point of view of the attacker. ��You would like the turn of the table. Okay, the latest Chad Flenderman novel... [everyone groans] written from the point of view of his nemesis, Dr. Lucifer Wu.
Alright everyone, look, it, alright my complaint was about Jim and Pam. So...
Hey... [sees both Jim and Pam] you two.
Hey.
No, they bring it in.
There���s two new guys back there with me now. They���re in their 20s. And we really get along.
Hey Kev.
I would love that.
It���s going to be nice to have just a healthy, young, fit presence in the middle of the office.
Hey, hey what are- why are you doing this?
Me?
...feel like I may have glossed over a few...
Hey, look what I found in the back. [shows a football to Pam] Wanna play? Teach you to throw.
And then Corporate is going to send in a lawyer...
The full story is that Randall resigned because of sexual harassment. So Corporate asked me to do a five minute review of the Company Sexual Harassment policy.
Ok, um, one thing that you're gonna want to look out for is carpal tunnel syndrome.  It's recommended that you take a ten minute break from typing every hour.  For your circulation, you're gonna want to get up out of your chairs and uh, and move around about ten minutes every hour.
Your outfit.
Can you stop...
Whoa.
It's a little tricky, you might have to... take... [Mose speeds away]
I think these belong to you. [puts toys down on desk]
Yeah, I'm really looking forward to working with you, Michael.
This is the prison. Uh, I am not going in there with expectations, per say. Uh, I will meet George Howard Scubb. I will tell him that I believe he is innocent. I would understand if he felt motivated to hug me. I would understand if a friendship began. How did, how did Bogart put it? [imitating Humphrey Bogart] I think this is a start of my first friendship.
[Creed takes a bite of an apple] Creed is eating an apple.  I found a potato.
There's this female uh, uh, stenographer at the courthouse...
Who are you seeing? That's gr���
It's over.
What did I do?
No, no. Andy.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, er... pull up a chair or sit on the shredder.
Well, no. He hates jams.
Michael, I'm your HR Rep. I'm on your side.
Uh... what was your favorite flavor of...
What, what happened?
I'm allergic to mushrooms.
Michael, I'm sorry...
Self-defense is not some fun boxing match, okay? This is about escaping with your life. So... strike, scream, and run. All right? Let���s try it.
There were two or three 'sorry's in there. [mumbles along with Nellie]
Michael, nine different people emailed me that photo, including my ex-wife... we don't talk now.
Fingerprints can be planted. You know with a severed hand...
And that's how you broke your ankle?
You know, when I was on j-duty, uh, Strangler case, we used to recreate the various stranglings with empanadas from- at Ernesto's.
[whispering] John Stamos.
That is unbelievable.
Just keep going.
[sits down for his ID picture] Just take it. [flashes goes off, while he is standing back up again]
Alright, it's getting gooier so we'll just do it later.
Okay.
Fine. Good.
I love it. I love it... I would love a picture of the two of us, to also take to Costa Rica.
You solved it?
Oh, cool. It looks really interesting. What did you end up with? [Ryan pulls Creed's old coat out of a bag] Sorry.
Well, the most common scenario is a larger man attacking a smaller female.
[to Sasha] Okay, tell them what you wanted to say.
You remember that.
Nice.
I don't wanna do this.
What?
I got lost.
Alright, just know that you're not in the Finer Things Club.
There's a bunch of people back here, maybe...
Can���t. I took a course at the Weintraub Memory Academy. I sat next to this woman named Beverly Brook. She had a Greek salad for lunch. See what I mean?
Oh, this looks great. I'd, I'd love to be there, but my daughter's play is tonight. ... Damnit! You know, one of the other parents will probably videotape it.
Note? It's a symphony.
I don���t know if this is gonna help...Uh...
Thanks Dwight.
What was fun about it for you?  Was it the death of the twins?
[answering phone] This is Toby. Hey Pam. Where are you calling from?
[to Darryl] Hey, you tricked me. You just wanted Kevin.
You can only fire Nellie for cause.
I know people are only this excited to talk to me because of the trial. But, they talk to me for a while, and maybe people realize I have something to say. And then one day, we're just talking.
Okay, I���m at what���s called ���the decision point.���
Well I just wanted to say I'm doing it. [Toby leaves]
Hey Darryl, look ahhh, we're here to apologize ahh...
Tough? I put an innocent man on death row.
Who's Jeff?
...about some other people engaging in PDA and, you know [Michael leans in closer to Toby] I just wanted to remind it's not appropriate to, to do that.
Guys, it's a really big deal. [rubs his neck]
Please sit down.
Hi, Jan.
Ryan, is, uh, dead.
Hey you wanted to see me?
About you and Jan.
Mmm-hmm.
Uh, you know what, I can go park it myself.
Alright... Well, um, if you really believe that Stanley was joking...
It was obvious...
I thought I was T-Dog.
Good luck Gabe.
It's just boiler plating, you don't have to read it.
Hey, Jim!
A little ironic that I'm going to be kind of a TV star, because my last Chad Flendermen novel [groups groans] was based on a murdered TV star. The small screen-
Hey, uh... where'd you decide to take Karen tonight?
Okay, I'm lost.
Bears.
Did you even read it?
Michael?
To your HR representative.
I really disagree with this. I think it's kind of hateful. Though I am a little happy right now to have a platform to talk about the outcome of a case I was recently a juror on. The Scranton Strangler. That man's being put to death. I was part of the verdict, and I'm not so sure he's guilty any more. [Dwight plays a clip from the song Oh Yeah: Ohhhh yeah! Chica chicaaa]
Hmmm.
Well, it's one of my strengths, but it's the manager's job.
No, it's nothing. We'll just... [shakes hand]
Well that's sweet, I missed you guys too.
Wow, you just dive right into it.
It is enough of this. Everyone, let���s go back to work.
You're into trains?
I didn't think you were.
He couldn't have made it a circle?
I should get back to work.
It's not.  It's not.  Sit down or I am writing you up.
If you really want to have kids, I--- I guess you could somehow... foster parent, or something.
Uhh, oh boy, oh boy.
Ahhh, kay.  Look, we could all file complaints against each other and just drown in a sea of paperwork, but you know, we can just move on with our... with our lives.
Sorry. Hey, Toby Flenderson. Nice to meet you. How can I help?
Sunday church service... it's been a few years. The Big Guy and I, we got some catching up to do.
I don't think Pam's gonna want to come into the men's room.
Well I guess this weddings not going to happen.  I wonder if this is it for them.  [Jim and Pam walk in laughing]
You know what would be the hottest thing ever? It���s a pregnant Helen Mirren.
Office relationships are never a good idea. Yeah. So let's just try to avoid them. But, um, if you already have one, you should disclose it to HR.
Well, uh, okay. Um.  It's really great to be here tonight, with the Ferris wheel, the band, and the low sunlight.  I'm gonna miss you all when I go to Costa Rica, and if I keep drinking beer like this, I'm gonna have to take a leak-a. [laughter from audience, Michael looks at camera unhappily]  Look, on a more personal note, I just want to say thanks, you know, no matter what was going on in my life, you know, my divorce, or the custody battle, or that thing with my sister, it was just nice knowing I had a, a supportive place to come to where...
Maybe not some of them. Maybe not inappropriate ones.
Oh.
Yeah, me too.
I will send this off to corporate.  Make sure you hold on to your medical bills.  Feel better.
I prefer being stuck in a Costa Rican hospital.
I don't think the women in this office -
It's just a snack.
OK, Michael, are you aware that you ousted Oscar today?
Mineral-ey.
Shortly after Kelly left, Ryan quit and also moved to Ohio, for what he claimed were unrelated reasons.
Um, can you make it eleven?
[watch that Michael gave him beeps] Oh, some kind of... alarm.
Anyone can follow a Twitter feed. Wanna share a cab?
I called Tallahassee. He can ask you not to come in, but he can't dock your pay. That's not legal.
No!
You know, uh, what does it mean to be happy. [shakes head] Keep philosophers busy for awhile.
But there aren't...
Hey, did you go to Bishop Ohara?
Okay, that's hurtful talk. We've talked about that. You know, I don't interrupt your announcements.
So you have played it before?
Well for a minute there, I saw myself selling my house, moving to Costa Rica, learning how to surf. But, Costa Rica will still be there. When I'm 65.
Yeah.
Hi.
Under the stars. It was really beautiful, you should come.
It's just a birthday card.
Well, I was in the Seminary for a year and dropped out 'cause I wanted to have sex with this girl, Cathy.  Followed her to Scranton.  Took the first job I could find in H.R.  Later she divorced me.  So no, I wouldn't say I have a passion for H.R.
Hi, I'm uh, Toby Flenderson. I'm here to see George Howard Scubb.
Yeah.
No, they're clean.  I was going to wear them to volleyball practice later.
You filled them in and faxed them yourself!
Michael, look.  I know this is hard for you, but death's just a part of life.  I mean, just this morning I saw a little bird fly into the glass doors downstairs and die.  And I had to keep going.
[halfway out] Yeah, I know.
Hey, I just got the word on the communal birthdays. Great idea.
[To Nellie in the kitchen] Here's the thing about moonlight. It's not sunlight.
I'd say all the goofing around at Pam's desk, and, and hanging out with Pam, has finally caught up to him... w-with Pam
Come on Michael. Those are all fake stories.
Well, that'll work.
[unintelligible mumbling]
I already signed it. I was just showing you.
[on video cam with his brother] Here's the thing Rory, I knew you guys would hit it off in an odd way.
I don't know, you?
Yeah, I also learned some interesting things about how they structure...
Yeah, uh, she'll be starting next week. If you have any questions about the transition, just let me know.
Hey I left my glasses down here somewhere. Crossing through, beep beep. [Pam's plane hit Toby in the eye]
No, I would never ever do anything like that. But it does seem like something you would do.
Who looks exactly like you.
No.
You--you might consider pulling it down a touch.  It's ri--it's riding up a little high.
That is-- that is a loaded question.
I don't... I don't think we can do that.
Oh, Happy Birthday.
Who was the main character?
Of course not!
Yeah. No, it's uncanny.
Michael...
Okay.
If they were dilated...
That's no burst pipe.
Just the once.
If I won the lottery, I don't know. I don't think I'd make any changes to my life. Quit my job, move, meet someone....
[confused] W-What?
Chicken piccata, side salad.
It is real, thank you for saying that.
Yeah, and I, uh, I think that the very fact that we're including it in our agenda frankly, is a big step forward.
Oh.
Really?
Okay, that is not true.
Let���s do it. Let���s get personal.
Hey, really nice job in that meeting in there.
As part of my last day I'm training the new Human Resources rep in the ways of the company. Again, the company has allotted for this training-one day.
I guess everything's okay.
Well, why would you need relocation, if you already live in Scranton?
Hey, Pam.
Okay.  And-- the-the power-- comes from the back foot.  So its-- its all one motion through the-- body.  So you stay a little low and there's a twist.  You keep your shoulder down and you kind of throw out the arm.  [demonstrates punch] Pow!
Casual Fridays are cancelled.  [everyone protests]  Let's just not do it anymore.
Oh.
I can neither confirm nor deny this. Let's just say I'll be up to my neck in jury duty. [excited outbursts]
You have to stop. [bangs on glass window]
Are... are you me?
Well, you're going to have to let 'em out. Or... or I will.
Uh, no, that's okay.
This is great.  My ex-wife's going to be so pissed.  [chuckles] For once daddy's gonna be a hero.
I'm Toby.
Well, that has wheels.
Yeah, I don't know why you picked names that are also guys' names.
You gonna eat all that dog food yourself?
It's the empanada guy.
I was at a parent-teacher conference.
Well, that was better.
[gesturing to the rest of the office] This is everybody else... okay... This is the place... so thanks for the lift.
I only have $200.
You know but the police could have been out there you know, catching real criminals instead of here searching my stuff.
All right Michael, but Oscar's really gay.
[dancing with Pam] [sobbing]
I like it just us three.  [very quietly] I don't want it to change.
It's working. I'm doing it!
You wanted to see the gooey eye.
Yeah, I���m���
[to Phyllis and Stanley] What are you guys talking about? I have a daughter. How can I be a virgin?
Hi Pam. Stay.
They don���t have vaginas.
That is not mine.  I have never seen that before.
Yeah, sure, what's up?
...and you bounce it off the wall on your side of the tape.
I just really like you.
Andy, we wanted to talk to you. A lot of us are very concerned about you.
Of course.
You know, anything that warms you.
Uh, great.  Why don't we move on?
Can I talk to you a second?
[sighs]
[on the computer] No, but I'm going zip lining tomorrow, through the, through the rainforest, with this cool couple I, I met at my hotel.  Wo-woman's amazing...
I work here.
Yeah, me too.
Good.
Michael, I have one extra twin bed, if you want.
This is fun. You know? I mean, this is fun.
Well, you need a wife first, or at least a girlfriend.
[looks resigned]
Hey.
No.  Can't, can't you just get up yourself?  I... You only grilled your foot.
[unwraps present; present is a rock with a Post-It note rubber-banded to it; reads] 'Suck on this.'
I don't know, I just thought you could include me.
Honestly, I don't even hear her anymore. It's like waves crashing against the beach.
Me, Dan from Buffalo, Mark Chisholm, Jeff from Albany and Ryan, obviously. Made so many s'mores, that I finally had to say, 'No more s'mores, no more s'mores.' [everyone in room but Michael laughs, Michael exits break room]
[smiling] Okay.
Dogs don't do that.
Uh-huh.
Mmhmm.
It's very important for you to be liked, isn't it?
[leans hobo sack against the refrigerator] It's a great stick, right?
A girl.
I'm good...
I mean for real.
Every Halloween I tell him the same thing - You can't bring weapons into the office, and every year he says the same thing - As soon as I get my weapons back I'm gonna kill you. But there I am at Thanksgiving, alive, you know. I'm a lucky turkey.
So, hey, you wanna trade?
Oh, I don���t know. I might turn in early.
I've got some ideas, I guess...
Yeah...
That's so cool.
Well, and you have a... yes, a- d- another chateau.
[knocks] Hey Jim.
I���ve seen guys like you. Big guys who like to push the little guys around. Lloyd Gross eats bullies like you for breakfast.
So... okay.
I really didn't think I was going to have a good time, but I did. Totally did.
Oop.
I'm just trying to help you Michael.
I spent three years in advertising before I came here.
There���s no shame in getting beaten up by a girl. My ex-wife used to demolish me.
Corporate will be sending someone else to take my place for a while.
He seems fine.
I am supposed to collect eyewitness accounts. Who saw Dwight do this? [all raise their hands]
Hey.
Oh, Dwight, we talked about this.
What is going on here?
Just three single guys. Getting into trouble.
[gets up and puts a hand on Michael's shoulder] Buddy, I think that...
Hey, what is this?
We're really not supposed to serve alcohol.
I'd like you to imagine a place where you feel very peaceful. For me, it's the walk from the yogurt shop to my car after I drop my daughter off on Sunday afternoons.
Well, Eric's just going over some stuff.
I should not be here. I���m in the- I was in the wrong- I���m- I���m sorry. Uh, just picture me back there. I- I was never here.
It's not.
I don't know.
Hi, nice to meet you.
Do you know her last name, yet?
Yeah. I���ll stop by.
There's not a single appropriate outfit in this whole--except mine, quite honestly.
...then she should be allowed to.
This place, um...
I can't believe this. [mistaking Darryl's sister for Darryl] Hey you, ass****!
I always thought he might have been set up but I felt pressured to convict.
89.
Mm-hmm.
Dead.
Absolutely. [Toby kisses Amy for an extended period of time, Pam and Jim are shocked]
Wow Michael, like this must be obvious how wrong this is.
I'd like to introduce you to my replacement.
I heard about the hit.  Just-- make sure it's off company property, right?
I'm sorry?
Hey guys.  This is my, uh, girlfriend, Amy.
We want to go home.
All right, if you're having a relationship with your superior, you must disclose it.
You know who's not gonna get to work on some exciting new startup this year? George Howard Skub, a.k.a. the alleged Scranton strangler, because he's in prison [Jim and Daryl walk out of the kitchen] for something he may not have done.
It's so random that I have it.
Sure.
[hands Meredith his camera] This one right here.
I think we might be about to maybe really get somewhere.
[crosses finish line] And the winner is Toby Flenderson.
What?
No, I'm sorry, it's...
Hey.
Ok, you know, Michael...
Oh, Andy, we had this exact same conversation when you wanted to get rid of Nellie. You can't just get rid of people over grudges.
[to passing female pedestrian] Smile if you love men���s prostates.
[takes duck back] Yes.
What?
Well, what���s a little while?
Well the 'fun' is in it. [conference room group chimes agreement.]
It was just...
What do you need?
I have good cards.
Nothing.
Wow.
Tell me!
Well, that's...
It's Beach Day...
[fending Andy off] Oh, come on. Andy, no.
He might start by asking each of you, ���Why do you think you���re here?���
Yes.
It's a dead animal in an office. You can't...
You know, for your own protection, you should disclose the relationship to HR.
Actually, she's right. This isn't appropriate. Why don't I take these.
Generally happy. [clip montage]
What's going on?
Ernesto!
I'm hungry.
Yes, it is your mistake. He���s lingering. So annoying. I���m gonna kill him. How can I help? I���m here.
Yes, uh some people in the office have complained...
That... [shakes head and places hand over the file]
...building looked into...
Well, it's important to support local art, you know. And what they do is not art.
Michael, it's up to me to check off the boxes, and I can't do that unless I honestly...
I- I said I'm Tony. Okay I made a mistake. I thought it might go unnoticed. But uh, I'm Toby.
It's out of context.  It's not the same as driving.
But now it's being looked at as more of a productivity issue.
Guys. Really, it's ok. Everyone has made a really solid first impression, I don't think there's any reason for anybody to worry.
How?
All right, thanks Michael.
Hey, I'd like to buy one of your dolls.
Would you consider this a terrorist incident?
Oh, sure, lots of times. Yeah. Wait, you and Pam aren���t in couple���s counseling, are you? Oh, God.
Clean it in your car.
Uh huh.
[crying] I'm sorry!
Well, we fired Roy, obviously.  And Jim won't press charges against Roy or the company.
Oh, Jim. Hey.
Chad Flendermen. Just an easy going black guy, he knows the streets, yet he also went to Oxford. So. Just as comfortable on a motorcycle as he is on Air Force One. Oh and he's also the world's leading Egyptologist.
Yeah.
Michael has been assigned six hours of mandatory counseling with a trained professional. I actually have a degree in social work. I mean, I know a lot of people would ask a few standard questions, and check off a few boxes, but I've got a chance to do some good here.
Hey. Hey, you know, I just realized uh, I don't have a picture of the two of us.
Oh, when you sign your job application you agree to comply with random drug testing.
I'm sorry, what is your three-step plan?
