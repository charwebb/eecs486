Uh, you know what, I can go park it myself.
[spying at Darryl's house] Sounds like a EMDP-40.
Hey, is that Michael?  Does he miss me?  [laughs]  Uh, Oscar?  Are you there?  Hello? [sighs]
Okay, you get a one-second hold on the ball...
Ah, you should probably deal with that outside of the work place.
Alright, just know that you're not in the Finer Things Club.
[fending Andy off] Oh, come on. Andy, no.
Yeah, I'm really looking forward to working with you, Michael.
Its really sad that your dog ran away. Why did it keep you from going to the park?
[after awkward pause] Sh, uh, um, I was having this separate conversation with Kevin. Uh, Johnny Depp.
Uh, no, the opposite. I was actually selected to be a juror on a very high-profile case.
Well, as you know, Ed Truck passed away. So, I'm here to talk about it if anyone would like to.
It's just a little dispute over a poster in their workspace.
Yeah. Um, you mind if I get a picture?
[sighing] Look, it's a free country. If she wants to throw a party...
Oh, yeah, no, it���s okay. I can handle it. Um, so���
We can play something more complicated if you like.
I don't really play cards, but I'm not gonna lie to you. It felt really good to take money from Michael. Gonna chase that feeling.
I think we might be about to maybe really get somewhere.
I like it just us three.  [very quietly] I don't want it to change.
[stands outside church entrance] Okay, this is, all right, this is silly. [goes inside] [walks back out] Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope...
Uh, well, we probably don't want to go just on seniority.
Well, I really can't talk about it, but it's a very high profile case.
Oh thanks.  She's gonna... [notices the doll is black] oh...
[walks up to Pam's desk with a binder] Hey Pam, could I talk to you for a sec?
Hey, uh... where'd you decide to take Karen tonight?
I mean, what���s the end date? It must be really hard for her to sign on to be unhappy if she doesn���t know when it���s gonna end.
I don't report to you, Michael. I report to the head of HR in New York.
I am on the wrong side, and I am freaking out here.
I can't believe this. [mistaking Darryl's sister for Darryl] Hey you, ass****!
All right, look, what you gotta understand is that when you come to work, you give up certain rights.
You think I have a machine for measuring bee hives?
[to passing female pedestrian] Smile if you love men���s prostates.
I-I think we hang out an appropriate amount of time.
Michael has been assigned six hours of mandatory counseling with a trained professional. I actually have a degree in social work. I mean, I know a lot of people would ask a few standard questions, and check off a few boxes, but I've got a chance to do some good here.
Sorry guys, but I don't think I tipped him for last year's.
Thanks, I'm gonna set it to Costa Rica time.
[on the computer] No, but I'm going zip lining tomorrow, through the, through the rainforest, with this cool couple I, I met at my hotel.  Wo-woman's amazing...
Oh, no, no. no. My plane just got in. From New York. Are you still with Piotr?
Michael, We should contact some experts.  You don't know what your doing.
Yeah, it just means whoever complained came to me later and withdrew it, so I took their name off.
Sorry. Hey, Toby Flenderson. Nice to meet you. How can I help?
I was-- I was gonna get the doll.
Hey, I'd like to buy one of your dolls.
Yeah, I don't know why you picked names that are also guys' names.
[on video cam with his brother] Here's the thing Rory, I knew you guys would hit it off in an odd way.
It's not.  It's not.  Sit down or I am writing you up.
You just got your corporate credit card back. Do you really want me to take it away again?
Hi, do you mind if I sign the card real quick?
I like to think Lloyd Gross is a no-nonsense guy who doesn���t back down from anybody. And he calls people ���Kimosabe���.
I'm gonna really miss going to beers with you guys every Tuesday night [Pam holds up soda in salute, Meredith yells 'yeah!', Michael looks at camera] and lastly, I'd love to urge you to keep up with my fight to have the building checked for radon gas.  You know, it's a, it's a real serious matter, and every time I try to have the, uh...
The simple solution would be to open a window... if we had... windows that could open.
Andy, we wanted to talk to you. A lot of us are very concerned about you.
Hey, text from the old wife. Gonna take that. [runs outside]
Hey, Andy, Nobody's calling you crazy, Andy. We're your friends, Andy.
Okay.  And-- the-the power-- comes from the back foot.  So its-- its all one motion through the-- body.  So you stay a little low and there's a twist.  You keep your shoulder down and you kind of throw out the arm.  [demonstrates punch] Pow!
No, I did not violate an Indian burial ground. In fact I had some good luck recently, Alfredo's Pizza, picked my business card out of the basket, so... uh, I got a week of free pies.
Toy Story 2, one of the best movies I ever saw. I went for my daughter and stayed because you can't leave your daughter in a theater.
Uh, I just wanted to let you know that, uh, I'll be taking a leave of absence starting next week.
Come on Michael. Those are all fake stories.
Hey Dwight. Pretty nice robe- [Dwight grabs bag with robe in it and walks away.] Why?
Um, yeah, ah, ah, that means a lot.  Thank you for saying it.
[nods] ...You know, I, uh, I know a little about what you're going through in a way. Um, when I was a kid, my parents got divorced. They both wanted custody, and they both asked me to testify against the other one in court. So, I don't know, I didn't want them getting divorced in the first place you know? I loved them both so much. I just wanted... [Michael pushes Toby's food tray off the table and walks off]
He- he can't do that.  Turns out she's allowed to have feelings of sexual arousal.  It doesn't become a violation until she physically acts on it.
Me, Dan from Buffalo, Mark Chisholm, Jeff from Albany and Ryan, obviously. Made so many s'mores, that I finally had to say, 'No more s'mores, no more s'mores.' [everyone in room but Michael laughs, Michael exits break room]
I'd like to introduce you to my replacement.
Hey... [sees both Jim and Pam] you two.
Michael, we are only allowed to talk about Meredith's work performance. We can not ask her to stop drinking.
Michael, it's up to me to check off the boxes, and I can't do that unless I honestly...
Well, I don't think there's any reason to check 'em but I suppose if we wanted to be really certain...
Alright everyone, look, it, alright my complaint was about Jim and Pam. So...
Hey guys.  This is my, uh, girlfriend, Amy.
[hands Meredith his camera] This one right here.
[on speakerphone] Well you know, frankly a lot of us have been saying this for a long time.
Yeah. So anyway, the entire jury wants me to vote guilty. But then I did a little research of my own, and forget everything you thought you knew about fingerprinting.
Yeah, well... Not everybody has what we have.
I didn't put caprese salad in my drawer, Michael.
Maybe you could just take the rest of the day off... you know...
[in a hospital bed, watching Entourage in Spanish] Oh, I went zip lining my third day in Costa Rica.  I guess the harness wasn't strapped in exactly right.  I broke my neck.  And, I've been in the hospital five weeks now.  I still haven't seen the beach.  It's nice to have visitors.
I have like, like a blue shirt? I don't wear a lot of colors, I have a lot of tan. Uh huh.
No it's not. It's a type of pipe. You can fill it with tobacco, often mixed with fruit, or other flavors.
Actually, she's right. This isn't appropriate. Why don't I take these.
Well, good.  We can, uh, throw that one out. [shuffles through papers]
That is not mine.  I have never seen that before.
Oh, no, I-- no, no, I was gonna buy that doll.
I-- I don���t know if there���s truth to-- to, uh, to that.
You know, why don't we split the order? It's only fair.
Now, we���re actually a lot closer to Binghamton than you are. Kimosabe.
It is real, thank you for saying that.
These things just have a way of working themselves out.
If I won the lottery, I don't know. I don't think I'd make any changes to my life. Quit my job, move, meet someone....
You know they're teasing you. I mean... obviously, this is... a much nicer place than an actual prison. We get paid to be here. We go home afterwards and have social lives. We have... we have parties here. They're teasing you. To be funny.
[standing in the church sanctuary, talking to the stained glass] Why you always got to be so mean to me?
This is great.  My ex-wife's going to be so pissed.  [chuckles] For once daddy's gonna be a hero.
What are, are you doing at my desk?
This is the prison. Uh, I am not going in there with expectations, per say. Uh, I will meet George Howard Scubb. I will tell him that I believe he is innocent. I would understand if he felt motivated to hug me. I would understand if a friendship began. How did, how did Bogart put it? [imitating Humphrey Bogart] I think this is a start of my first friendship.
Hey, hey what are- why are you doing this?
Ok, I can't count the hour if you don't talk.
Well, it... there was. But Michael scheduled it for 4:58 on a Friday. You know, people sang in the parking lot.
I made it this far, right? What's the point?
Office relationships are never a good idea. Yeah. So let's just try to avoid them. But, um, if you already have one, you should disclose it to HR.
I guess I shouldn't have stopped for dinner.
You know who's not gonna get to work on some exciting new startup this year? George Howard Skub, a.k.a. the alleged Scranton strangler, because he's in prison [Jim and Daryl walk out of the kitchen] for something he may not have done.
I'd say all the goofing around at Pam's desk, and, and hanging out with Pam, has finally caught up to him... w-with Pam
Thanks... [Hank is standing next to Michael] Really, Michael?
Okay, that's hurtful talk. We've talked about that. You know, I don't interrupt your announcements.
[whispering] I am not doing your dirty work for you.
Except you just told me you were gonna make it up. Now if she sues, I have to testify against you.
I really didn't think I was going to have a good time, but I did. Totally did.
You know, Michael, sometimes my daughter's stomach hurts when there's a mean girl at school...
Well, and you have a... yes, a- d- another chateau.
Yeah, um... I can���t believe you remembered. I do self-defense. Um, I���ll go put on my cup.
Well, we did a little investigation and Dwight had a good point.  The ladder didn't reach the top shelf.  I don't know if I believe it, but I am a fan of the hardboiled detective novel.  [impression] I'll punch you in da mush, see.
Well, you need a wife first, or at least a girlfriend.
It���s interesting that you���re drawn to the point of view of the attacker. ��You would like the turn of the table. Okay, the latest Chad Flenderman novel... [everyone groans] written from the point of view of his nemesis, Dr. Lucifer Wu.
I am so glad I got all of the dudes to do Movember. We have the dopest time back in the annex.
No, no, no. It's not fair. What if Kevin wants to buy cookies from me?
Yeah... that's why they pay me the big bucks.  [both laugh]
Well, you're going to have to let 'em out. Or... or I will.
Michael, this is really inappropriate to talk about.
Well I just wanted to say I'm doing it. [Toby leaves]
Toby, you are playing a dangerous game. Guess I'm through the gateway now, though, right?
Well, the most common scenario is a larger man attacking a smaller female.
You know what Michael? You're right. You win. This is pointless. We're not getting anywhere. I got a bunch of fun stuff, in case my daughter ever comes over. Why don't we just run out the clock by playing games, drawing some pictures, talking?
Oh, I don���t know. I might turn in early.
If you turn out the lights we'll do a little dance.
So, how would you go about settling interpersonal conflicts within the office?
But I mean���uh have you talked to her? Is sh���
Ok, I mean, I could talk to her.
[Michael and Holly are still working on the chair] What'd you guys do?
You know, for your own protection, you should disclose the relationship to HR.
I- I said I'm Tony. Okay I made a mistake. I thought it might go unnoticed. But uh, I'm Toby.
Thanks man! [awkwardly tries to hug Ryan, pats him on the back]
I could loan you a pair of socks.
Believe me, she has enough toys... she doesn't need your watch.
Shortly after Kelly left, Ryan quit and also moved to Ohio, for what he claimed were unrelated reasons.
Yeah, er... pull up a chair or sit on the shredder.
You mean food truck. Ernesto's was a food truck.
[laughs] Oh man, thanks, thank you, [tearing up] thank you, thank you.
Oh, hey, Bert. Wanna see the dance? Dem bones, dem bones, dem dry...
Michael, nine different people emailed me that photo, including my ex-wife... we don't talk now.
Michael, uh... we shouldn't be talking about this until all the decisions have been made.
Okay, I���m at what���s called ���the decision point.���
There were two or three 'sorry's in there. [mumbles along with Nellie]
It is enough of this. Everyone, let���s go back to work.
Well, we still have to do the exit interview.
It's a dead animal in an office. You can't...
Robert did say you'd be joining us. Welcome. I'm Tony.
Michael is like a movie on a plane.  You know, it's not great, but it's something to watch.  And when it's over you're like... how much time is left on this flight? Now what?
More like 'Everyone let's get your boss laid Saturday.' [more laughs] [Toby puts his hand on Pam's knee, everyone stares, Toby removes his hand] I have an announcement uh, to make. I am moving to Costa Rica. Thought about it for a long time now. And I'm finally gonna do it. So, I'm just gonna hop the fence and jog home now. [runs out of lobby and climbs the fence and jogs away]
It's like if you write someone a letter, when you're really angry... they say to keep it in a drawer for a couple days. Then you just never end up sending it.
It's very important for you to be liked, isn't it?
Yeah, the ball-throwing exercise is in the binder. It's in the section marked, 'Fun Ways To Make Brainstorming Sessions Explode With Excitement and Creativity.'
Chad Flendermen. Just an easy going black guy, he knows the streets, yet he also went to Oxford. So. Just as comfortable on a motorcycle as he is on Air Force One. Oh and he's also the world's leading Egyptologist.
Two dimes, seven nickels--Well, okay, no, that doesn't add up. It was one quarter and--
Um... I need to talk to you in your office. It'll just take two seconds.
Fine, I'll take your name off. [looks at Michael] So no one will know.
As part of my last day I'm training the new Human Resources rep in the ways of the company. Again, the company has allotted for this training-one day.
I don't know how I'm going to get through this. I don't want to lie and I DON'T want to tell the truth.
Does it have to be pizza? Could go for a, falafel?
There's this female uh, uh, stenographer at the courthouse...
I'd like you to imagine a place where you feel very peaceful. For me, it's the walk from the yogurt shop to my car after I drop my daughter off on Sunday afternoons.
Erin, HR is a joke. I can't do anything about anything.
This here is a radon test kit. [holding out tiny cylinder disc] Okay I will be putting 'em everywhere. And... please don't throw these out. [starts snapping towards Michael's face] This is a radon test kit. [continues snapping] Please don't throw these out. [Michael gives annoyed look] See them all over the office.
[Michael hands him a present] Wow, thanks, Michael, I...
Hi, I'm uh, Toby Flenderson. I'm here to see George Howard Scubb.
Well, I am trained in grief counseling, but, ahh, I don't think that's what they need right now.
Um, if, uh... um... I just completely forgot what I was going to say. It's so weird.
No, I would never ever do anything like that. But it does seem like something you would do.
You know I don't have to do the paperwork unless you're actually dating.
Yeah. I have my dignity too. I refuse to be another man's horsey.
It happens, okay? Uh, so let's just find an empty desk for you, and uh, I'm sure Robert will be with you as soon as he gets in.
Hey I need to talk to you right now.
It was actually kind of hard to meet people I found.
I should not be here. I���m in the- I was in the wrong- I���m- I���m sorry. Uh, just picture me back there. I- I was never here.
Kelly Kapoor is gone. Her fianc�� Ravi was hired as a pediatrics professor at Miami university.
No.  Can't, can't you just get up yourself?  I... You only grilled your foot.
Concentrating? Is anyone having trouble getting their work done today?
The Scranton strangler. George Howard Skub. Haven't I told you about the jury I was on a couple years ago?
You filled them in and faxed them yourself!
You can't claim territories. This is the only place I interact with people. Can't you sell at your church or barber shop? [Darryl looks hurt] Or chess club, or?
[leans hobo sack against the refrigerator] It's a great stick, right?
I always thought he might have been set up but I felt pressured to convict.
I don't think Pam's gonna want to come into the men's room.
You know, sometimes I wish we just didn't have a conference room. [Kelly laughs] You know? He couldn't do that.
I know people are only this excited to talk to me because of the trial. But, they talk to me for a while, and maybe people realize I have something to say. And then one day, we're just talking.
Alright... Well, um, if you really believe that Stanley was joking...
Kevin.  His gambling problem must've resurfaced. I'm gonna have to send him home until I can do an investigation.
Honestly, I don't even hear her anymore. It's like waves crashing against the beach.
Y'know I've been going over my notes from the trial...
Hey, I just got the word on the communal birthdays. Great idea.
Michael, I have one extra twin bed, if you want.
I know, um, but Ryan thinks that, uh, they're not good enough.
Sunday church service... it's been a few years. The Big Guy and I, we got some catching up to do.
Do- Well you should give him a little time to settle in. But-
[tossing forms at Michael] Just fill them out any way you want.
Hey I left my glasses down here somewhere. Crossing through, beep beep. [Pam's plane hit Toby in the eye]
I'm gonna... I'll go get one. Stay. [runs out of the office]
The lady cop acted like she'd never pulled someone over for driving too slow.  And I tried to get out of it with the famous Toby Flenderson 10,000 watt smile. [smiles] It didn't work.
OK, I am telling you, Oscar is an actual homosexual.  Yeah, he told me this morning.  And, obviously he hopes he can count on your discretion.
Well, we could try him out for a little while... [Jim drops his pen, looks exasperated] and if it doesn't work out, you know, maybe one of us could, you know, step in...
Okay, look, in a real crisis situation, you���re not gonna have to time to think, okay? So just remember, I-A-A-T-G. ���It���s all about the groin.���
Well that's sweet, I missed you guys too.
Guys, it's a really big deal. [rubs his neck]
That really hurt. I'm writing you up. [Angela makes an angry face] Hey, you are not allowed to touch other employees. Am I being clear?
Anyone can follow a Twitter feed. Wanna share a cab?
I wouldn't want to do that now would I?
There's not a single appropriate outfit in this whole--except mine, quite honestly.
You know, when I was on j-duty, uh, Strangler case, we used to recreate the various stranglings with empanadas from- at Ernesto's.
No, uh... [shouts] Does anyone have a camera here? [no one answers him] No one has a camera here. Uh...
Under the stars. It was really beautiful, you should come.
So this is H.R. This is your desk.
Hey Darryl, look ahhh, we're here to apologize ahh...
You know, uh, what does it mean to be happy. [shakes head] Keep philosophers busy for awhile.
[gets up and puts a hand on Michael's shoulder] Buddy, I think that...
Absolutely. [Toby kisses Amy for an extended period of time, Pam and Jim are shocked]
Wow, I'd love to take a look at that.
Hey, look what I found in the back. [shows a football to Pam] Wanna play? Teach you to throw.
I don't think Michael intended to punish me, by putting Ryan back here with Kelly.  But, if he did intend that?  Wow.  Genius.
���..Chad Flendermen's kryptonite. [Darryl walks up to Toby and Val in a tuxedo]
It's, uh... I was... might ask if you wanted...
Actually, I have a separate folder for complaints against Michael. This [unlocks a drawer]is January through March of this year. [pulls out a fairly large folder]
She's going to be screaming her own last name?
Well, it's one of my strengths, but it's the manager's job.
Hey, we're not all going to sit in a circle Indian style are we? [Laughing]
[answering phone] This is Toby. Hey Pam. Where are you calling from?
Well, uh, okay. Um.  It's really great to be here tonight, with the Ferris wheel, the band, and the low sunlight.  I'm gonna miss you all when I go to Costa Rica, and if I keep drinking beer like this, I'm gonna have to take a leak-a. [laughter from audience, Michael looks at camera unhappily]  Look, on a more personal note, I just want to say thanks, you know, no matter what was going on in my life, you know, my divorce, or the custody battle, or that thing with my sister, it was just nice knowing I had a, a supportive place to come to where...
Come on Dwight. We went over this, like for a half an hour.
There���s no shame in getting beaten up by a girl. My ex-wife used to demolish me.
I knew it. I knew it from the beginning it was possible.
Ah, this reminds me of the HR convention last fall.
I called Tallahassee. He can ask you not to come in, but he can't dock your pay. That's not legal.
The full story is that Randall resigned because of sexual harassment. So Corporate asked me to do a five minute review of the Company Sexual Harassment policy.
I don't know, I just thought you could include me.
This is a picture I've been carrying around in my wallet for about six years.  It's this unspoiled beach in Costa Rica, Playa Grande.  Um, I take it out when I get stressed or depressed, and it really calms me down.  Never thought I'd get to live here, you know.  But it turns out they built these great new condos there, so, this could be me, right around, uh, where the trees used to be.
Every Halloween I tell him the same thing - You can't bring weapons into the office, and every year he says the same thing - As soon as I get my weapons back I'm gonna kill you. But there I am at Thanksgiving, alive, you know. I'm a lucky turkey.
Corporate will be sending someone else to take my place for a while.
Okay, I think we should probably be okay.
Great.  Because you that I think the very fact that [Michael mutes the call]
[to Darryl] Hey, you tricked me. You just wanted Kevin.
OK I think Oscar would just like if you used 'lame' or something like that.
[entering Andy's office] Knock, knock. Hey, Sasha's first year in the troops, so I'm selling cookies for her. Anyway, would you like some?
Not much? What's up with you? [from bathroom above] Nah it's okay. I'm in the bathroom. Hey you been watching Damages this year? It's so good. No, you gotta tune in, it's as good as anything on HBO. [sound of pissing] Hey does blue go with tan?
Pete���s a pretty cool guy, though, and Andy was a terrible lover to Erin. He basically ignored her and left on a boat.
I got Angela. She is into these posters of babies dressed as adults. I got her one of those. I felt kind of weird buying that.
[opening kite from Ryan] Wow! Cause... [reveals Kite Runner book]
I'm just saying I don't think it's appropriate for you to have given Ryan that award.
So remember, intent is irrelevant. And that's it. Pam?
If we don't patronise the only Syrian restaurant in town, there'll be nothing left but pan pizzas and make-your-own salads.
I'm makin' great time. Usually I have to take a bathroom break half way through a race like this, but not today.
Andy, you know I can���t do that. It���d be lying.
You--you might consider pulling it down a touch.  It's ri--it's riding up a little high.
A few years ago, when I was on the jury of the Scranton Strangler..
[gesturing to the rest of the office] This is everybody else... okay... This is the place... so thanks for the lift.
He might start by asking each of you, ���Why do you think you���re here?���
Well, look, sometimes things crop up later. So, uhh, you should know I'm always available if anyone would like to talk.
Think you could...[wants to hand the camera to Jim, but Jim is starting to snuggle up with Pam, posing.  Toby aims the camera, the flash pops up] Okay. [takes picture] Okay.
I'm going to the prison. This afternoon. I'm gonna talk to the strangler.
[excitedly] Oh, I should get the accident report binder. I've never used the gun violence forms before.
There���s two new guys back there with me now. They���re in their 20s. And we really get along.
When I put it in I thought it would be a waste of time, but I guess it was worth it.
Yeah, um, but now apparently Darryl has some issue with his...
I spent three years in advertising before I came here.
I don't... I don't think we can do that.
[Warehouse Worker Frank remains silent, picks ear] You sort of deserve an apology here. Frank?
We even go to lunch, pick up babes.
Well, you know how everyone fast forwards through ads these days? Well, what about an ad in slow motion. You know, if they fast forward through it, it'll just seem normal and it will catch your eye. Plus, uh, the slogan could be: Dunder Mifflin, we adapt to the pace of your business. [murmurs of approval by everyone but Michael]
Michael, do you have the name of the employee you're letting go? I'd like to start working on out-placement.
No, No, No.  No, I'm just curious if you've heard of it.
No.  It's even-- it's even better than the one I wanted.
Well I guess this weddings not going to happen.  I wonder if this is it for them.  [Jim and Pam walk in laughing]
I can refer you to someone to talk to.
Yes, uh some people in the office have complained...
I'll have Erin fax them back to corporate.
It's digital, so just take as many as you want.
That was... I went to Costa Rica for a few months.  What is going on?
I would spend a lot of time launching my true crime podcast, The Flenderson Files. Dum bum buh. [whispers] Flenderson files.
Yeah, I assumed Michael was already doing this.  That's why I only use my personal e-mail account.
Now, if your attacker is willing to defile a corpse, you better stop playing dead right away and just make it known that you���re alive.
...feel like I may have glossed over a few...
I normally do nothing, I guess. No, you shouldn't- [Holly knocks on Michael's door]
You have to stop. [bangs on glass window]
This may be the first time that a male subordinate has attempted to get a modest scheduled raise by threatening to withhold sex from a female superior.  It will be a groundbreaking case when it inevitably goes to trial.
Well, Kelly's been so upset about Ryan dumping her, that she can't even talk. [grins]
Oh, you guys. Kelly called it. 2013. So s���hey! Hey! Hey, no! No! Get outta here. Clark, get outta here.
Angela, what do you want me to do?
Well, I was hoping that maybe in light of everything that's happened today, it would be a good idea if today, you, me, and Michael could head into the conference room for some conflict resolution.
[singing and dancing] Dem bones, dem bones, dem tired bones, now we're the skeleton crew.
Hey, what's going on?  You don't have my permission to do this.
No, no, no, no, no. Women chase him. He misses his wife.
Hey, this came with the Stamford book. [Sets down box that says: Personnel Files Stamford CT Office Confidential] Can you take care of it?
[To Nellie in the kitchen] Here's the thing about moonlight. It's not sunlight.
But I-- I promised my daughter. Darryl, look-- I-- I need the doll, I need the doll.  I-- I'm-- I'm begging you.  I just-- I need it more than anything in this world.  I need this doll. Darryl, man I need this doll.
Say Anything, The Shining, Annie Hall, that's too obvious.
How are you? Hey. Welcome back. [puts out fist to bump]
I don���t know if this is gonna help...Uh...
Ahhh, kay.  Look, we could all file complaints against each other and just drown in a sea of paperwork, but you know, we can just move on with our... with our lives.
Yeah, and I, uh, I think that the very fact that we're including it in our agenda frankly, is a big step forward.
[alone in cab} After Dwight fired me, I moved to New York to write the great American novel. I have six roommates. Heh. Which are better than friends, you know ���cause they have to give you one month���s notice before they leave.
Actually, I didn't think it was appropriate to invite children since it's... You know, there's gambling and alcohol, and it's in our dangerous warehouse and it's a school night... And, you know, Hooters is catering. You know, is that enough? Should I keep going?
...about some other people engaging in PDA and, you know [Michael leans in closer to Toby] I just wanted to remind it's not appropriate to, to do that.
Michael, can I talk to you for a uh, second please?
Well the 'fun' is in it. [conference room group chimes agreement.]
...and you bounce it off the wall on your side of the tape.
Oh, Andy, we had this exact same conversation when you wanted to get rid of Nellie. You can't just get rid of people over grudges.
It���s going to be nice to have just a healthy, young, fit presence in the middle of the office.
I don't really think people are in the laughing mood.
[to Phyllis and Stanley] What are you guys talking about? I have a daughter. How can I be a virgin?
Can���t. I took a course at the Weintraub Memory Academy. I sat next to this woman named Beverly Brook. She had a Greek salad for lunch. See what I mean?
Oh, when you sign your job application you agree to comply with random drug testing.
This is a bloodbath. Alright, I���m calling this.
All right, well, let���s try one simple technique together. Okay, why doesn���t everyone stand? Okay, so... you���re being attacked. You���ve got your hands up. Simple palm strike to the chin. Up to the chin. One, two.
Andy, it's not the original. And destroying it will not stop them from dating. Andy. [Andy throws paper at him and leaves, Toby straightens paper out] It's the original.
Hey, what's going on? There's a police car in the...
Well, we fired Roy, obviously.  And Jim won't press charges against Roy or the company.
We should stay to maybe some more traditional models...
What was fun about it for you?  Was it the death of the twins?
Ok, look the memo is not about you...
Jan told me just a few minutes before she told you.
Well, I was in the Seminary for a year and dropped out 'cause I wanted to have sex with this girl, Cathy.  Followed her to Scranton.  Took the first job I could find in H.R.  Later she divorced me.  So no, I wouldn't say I have a passion for H.R.
I just though you could add me.  I don't see the harm in that.
Do you see David Wallace in the room right now?
A little ironic that I'm going to be kind of a TV star, because my last Chad Flendermen novel [groups groans] was based on a murdered TV star. The small screen-
Forcing your employees to set you up is not a, uh, uh, technical violation of any Dunder Mifflin rule.  You know, but neither is forcing them to help you with a shot-by-shot remake of Indiana Jones.  Huh-how do you make a rule book like that?
Yes, it is your mistake. He���s lingering. So annoying. I���m gonna kill him. How can I help? I���m here.
That... [shakes head and places hand over the file]
I don't think laughing about it is an appropriate response.
And then Corporate is going to send in a lawyer...
A guy on my street fell off a ladder painting his house.  It was on the news.
[sighs and pulls out a box under his desk] It's all Dwight's.
Technically, I am in Human Resources. And Dwight was asking about human anatomy. Um... I'm just sad the public school system failed him so badly.
Hey, really nice job in that meeting in there.
How will your experience selling refinery equipment translate to our smaller scale here?
Oh, there's a whole 'nother terrorism booklet for that.
If you really want to have kids, I--- I guess you could somehow... foster parent, or something.
You gonna eat all that dog food yourself?
Tough? I put an innocent man on death row.
Yeah, I also learned some interesting things about how they structure...
Well, it's important to support local art, you know. And what they do is not art.
I love The Finer Things Club.  My ex-wife used to have a book club, and I would read their book and sometimes listen from the kitchen.
You know it���s not just pregnant women who don���t get their due. You know who���s gorgeous? Helen Mirren.
I���m just curious though, what do you have against Pete and Erin?
...and, yeah, the whole thing was incredibly cathartic.
To whomever, meaning us, the indirect object. Which is the correct usage of the word.
Pam, can I talk to you for a second?
Michael's behavior is erratic and unpredictable, but I don't think he's doing drugs. Maybe he should. Take the edge off. Uh, not at work, of course.
Let's just wait and see what happens. [whispers] You know?
It's a little tricky, you might have to... take... [Mose speeds away]
Um, yeah.  You're computer screen can be a big strain on your eyes, so uh, it's also recommended that you step away for about... about ten minutes every hour.
[to Sasha] Okay, tell them what you wanted to say.
No, no,... no. Sorry. We cut Kevin off for the same thing. You have to have something to say, if you talk. [Angela rolls her eyes and stops talking]
Um... in fact, basic rule of thumb, let's just act everyday like Pam's Mom's coming in. All right. That's it. Um... if anybody has any questions about anything, you know where I sit in the back.
It's out of context.  It's not the same as driving.
But now it's being looked at as more of a productivity issue.
Looks like we kicked it. [indicates water jug is empty]
I know right?  I just want to go, and look at art, and swim in the Adriatic.
Uh, we're on recess. I came for the party. Hey, everyone.
I'm, I'm not gonna comment on my personal life.
[Creed takes a bite of an apple] Creed is eating an apple.  I found a potato.
Unless part of you made that mistake on purpose.
Well, why would you need relocation, if you already live in Scranton?
Talk to Michael. I gave him the box.
Fingerprints can be planted. You know with a severed hand...
Ryan invited me to go on his wilderness adventure retreat. It was this amazing, beautiful experience [Michael knocks on the window behind Toby from outside]
Miami University in Ohio. On her last day, Kelly was still a little confused about it
Yeah, uh, she'll be starting next week. If you have any questions about the transition, just let me know.
You can't, [Michael touches his forehead and makes sizzling noise] Ow. Look, you cannot push religion.
Really? You were gonna throw out a book?
I love it. I love it... I would love a picture of the two of us, to also take to Costa Rica.
Sure. Wow. [Michael throws a pen at his head] Ow...
Um, why don't you go ask him that?
Uh, I really think that you need to address what happened with Stanley this morning...
Can't you just not look at his feet?
[standing behind Erin] I don't think this fax is going through. Is there a different... I can just put it through again, you know.
I w-, uh, I would love to give uh-
Oh, cool. It looks really interesting. What did you end up with? [Ryan pulls Creed's old coat out of a bag] Sorry.
You know but the police could have been out there you know, catching real criminals instead of here searching my stuff.
I will send this off to corporate.  Make sure you hold on to your medical bills.  Feel better.
You know, I actually lived in Honolulu for a year.
Yes, that's true. I have never won a Dundie. I am more than okay  with that.
I think these belong to you. [puts toys down on desk]
There's a bunch of people back here, maybe...
Oh, sure, lots of times. Yeah. Wait, you and Pam aren���t in couple���s counseling, are you? Oh, God.
All right, now Oscar's feeling discriminated against by his co-workers, primarily Angela, and um, that's your fault.
Hey, Meredith.  Can I talk to you privately for a second?
This is fun. You know? I mean, this is fun.
Well, um, it was amazing.  It really was, thanks for asking.  Um the beaches were pristine...
Look, you know, in any company  there's going to be certain degrees -
I can't talk about it or I'll get removed from the jury.
Yeah, I guess it will be my, uh, thing in Costa Rica, be a nature photographer.
Michael, look.  I know this is hard for you, but death's just a part of life.  I mean, just this morning I saw a little bird fly into the glass doors downstairs and die.  And I had to keep going.
Hey. Hey, you know, I just realized uh, I don't have a picture of the two of us.
That was the right decision for me and my marriage.
[to Kevin] Honestly, is there any way you can get on your fiancee's plan? Our health plan is s... just... it's terrible.
You know what would be the hottest thing ever? It���s a pregnant Helen Mirren.
Oh, wow, this is, uh, just a mystery novel that I've been working on.
Guys, I think Michael and Luke are related.
[on phone] Hey Sasha, it's daddy.  Have you ever heard of this doll , Princess Unicorn?
Okay, that is fine to feel, but not to act on.
I don't think the women in this office -
I'm sorry, if we did something to upset you, I'm sure it was inadvertent.
Uh, Holly Flax, she comes from the Nashua branch.
Casual Fridays are cancelled.  [everyone protests]  Let's just not do it anymore.
You can't fire Pete. You understand why, right?
Guys. Really, it's ok. Everyone has made a really solid first impression, I don't think there's any reason for anybody to worry.
You know this sounds a lot like the premise of my latest Chad Flendermen novel. A murder for framing.
Oh, this looks great. I'd, I'd love to be there, but my daughter's play is tonight. ... Damnit! You know, one of the other parents will probably videotape it.
No, I mean he's attracted to other men.
Alright, I wasn't expecting that. Let's uh... let's go draw.
Michael, I'm your HR Rep. I'm on your side.
Well, as you know, Dwight has filed a lot of complaints against you over the years.
You���re really there to talk to each other. I would say that the therapist is more of a facilitator.
So Dwight and Darryl came to an agreement that both would file complaints with corporate and now I get to do all this paperwork.  We worked it out.
Self-defense is not some fun boxing match, okay? This is about escaping with your life. So... strike, scream, and run. All right? Let���s try it.
Hi, Kevin. Look, I need to talk to you about-
Oh well, you know, those were only for, you know [makes quotes with fingers] relationships, so... if, if this is just a casual thing, there's no need, really.
Wow Michael, like this must be obvious how wrong this is.
Oh, it wasn't camping, it was more of a wilderness retreat. [Michael walks in]
[watch that Michael gave him beeps] Oh, some kind of... alarm.
