I'd like to introduce you to my replacement.
Michael, uh... we shouldn't be talking about this until all the decisions have been made.
There���s no shame in getting beaten up by a girl. My ex-wife used to demolish me.
I wouldn't want to do that now would I?
Uh, Holly Flax, she comes from the Nashua branch.
[after awkward pause] Sh, uh, um, I was having this separate conversation with Kevin. Uh, Johnny Depp.
Alright everyone, look, it, alright my complaint was about Jim and Pam. So...
Thanks man! [awkwardly tries to hug Ryan, pats him on the back]
Um, ex-wife. Yeah. Um, her last name is 'Becker' now.
Well that's sweet, I missed you guys too.
Great.  Because you that I think the very fact that [Michael mutes the call]
Tough? I put an innocent man on death row.
[unwraps present; present is a rock with a Post-It note rubber-banded to it; reads] 'Suck on this.'
We even go to lunch, pick up babes.
All right, if you're having a relationship with your superior, you must disclose it.
There's this female uh, uh, stenographer at the courthouse...
No, No, No.  No, I'm just curious if you've heard of it.
I���m just curious though, what do you have against Pete and Erin?
Andy, it's not the original. And destroying it will not stop them from dating. Andy. [Andy throws paper at him and leaves, Toby straightens paper out] It's the original.
Under the stars. It was really beautiful, you should come.
Hey, really nice job in that meeting in there.
Concentrating? Is anyone having trouble getting their work done today?
Uh, I just wanted to let you know that, uh, I'll be taking a leave of absence starting next week.
It's just boiler plating, you don't have to read it.
Pam, can I talk to you for a second?
Oh, Andy, we had this exact same conversation when you wanted to get rid of Nellie. You can't just get rid of people over grudges.
[standing in the church sanctuary, talking to the stained glass] Why you always got to be so mean to me?
[To Nellie in the kitchen] Here's the thing about moonlight. It's not sunlight.
I know right?  I just want to go, and look at art, and swim in the Adriatic.
Yeah... that's why they pay me the big bucks.  [both laugh]
Cause Ryan asked me to talk to you.
Oh, yeah, no, it���s okay. I can handle it. Um, so���
Well, we fired Roy, obviously.  And Jim won't press charges against Roy or the company.
I know, um, but Ryan thinks that, uh, they're not good enough.
Um, yeah.  You're computer screen can be a big strain on your eyes, so uh, it's also recommended that you step away for about... about ten minutes every hour.
Um, why don't you go ask him that?
I don't really think people are in the laughing mood.
Andy, we wanted to talk to you. A lot of us are very concerned about you.
I can't talk about it or I'll get removed from the jury.
[to Kevin] Honestly, is there any way you can get on your fiancee's plan? Our health plan is s... just... it's terrible.
What are, are you doing at my desk?
Um, if, uh... um... I just completely forgot what I was going to say. It's so weird.
I am supposed to collect eyewitness accounts. Who saw Dwight do this? [all raise their hands]
If you turn out the lights we'll do a little dance.
Yes, it is your mistake. He���s lingering. So annoying. I���m gonna kill him. How can I help? I���m here.
Guys. Really, it's ok. Everyone has made a really solid first impression, I don't think there's any reason for anybody to worry.
Toy Story 2, one of the best movies I ever saw. I went for my daughter and stayed because you can't leave your daughter in a theater.
Unless part of you made that mistake on purpose.
Yeah, and I, uh, I think that the very fact that we're including it in our agenda frankly, is a big step forward.
Every Halloween I tell him the same thing - You can't bring weapons into the office, and every year he says the same thing - As soon as I get my weapons back I'm gonna kill you. But there I am at Thanksgiving, alive, you know. I'm a lucky turkey.
No, I did not violate an Indian burial ground. In fact I had some good luck recently, Alfredo's Pizza, picked my business card out of the basket, so... uh, I got a week of free pies.
We can play something more complicated if you like.
I- I said I'm Tony. Okay I made a mistake. I thought it might go unnoticed. But uh, I'm Toby.
OK, Michael, are you aware that you ousted Oscar today?
[entering Andy's office] Knock, knock. Hey, Sasha's first year in the troops, so I'm selling cookies for her. Anyway, would you like some?
That���s true. There���s no rule. You can check the employee handbook. Oh, can I check the employee handbook Lloyd? Well, does it say anything about me choking a man with my bare hands?
All right, now Oscar's feeling discriminated against by his co-workers, primarily Angela, and um, that's your fault.
You know this sounds a lot like the premise of my latest Chad Flendermen novel. A murder for framing.
Anyone can follow a Twitter feed. Wanna share a cab?
No, no.  Um, you always want to keep a sweater or cardigan of some sort, in case it gets drafty.
No.  Can't, can't you just get up yourself?  I... You only grilled your foot.
Hey, um did you go to uh, Bishop O'Hara?
[to Sasha] Okay, tell them what you wanted to say.
Oh, hey, Bert. Wanna see the dance? Dem bones, dem bones, dem dry...
Looks like we kicked it. [indicates water jug is empty]
I don't think Michael intended to punish me, by putting Ryan back here with Kelly.  But, if he did intend that?  Wow.  Genius.
You know, I always knew if Michael just took the time to get to know me, we'd become friends.
Well, the most common scenario is a larger man attacking a smaller female.
Well, you need a wife first, or at least a girlfriend.
Corporate will be sending someone else to take my place for a while.
Hey I left my glasses down here somewhere. Crossing through, beep beep. [Pam's plane hit Toby in the eye]
Oh well, you know, those were only for, you know [makes quotes with fingers] relationships, so... if, if this is just a casual thing, there's no need, really.
Hey I need to talk to you right now.
It���s going to be nice to have just a healthy, young, fit presence in the middle of the office.
Yeah, I'm really looking forward to working with you, Michael.
Okay, that is fine to feel, but not to act on.
A little ironic that I'm going to be kind of a TV star, because my last Chad Flendermen novel [groups groans] was based on a murdered TV star. The small screen-
I got Angela. She is into these posters of babies dressed as adults. I got her one of those. I felt kind of weird buying that.
Ryan invited me to go on his wilderness adventure retreat. It was this amazing, beautiful experience [Michael knocks on the window behind Toby from outside]
[stands outside church entrance] Okay, this is, all right, this is silly. [goes inside] [walks back out] Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope...
Oh, no, I-- no, no, I was gonna buy that doll.
Talk to Michael. I gave him the box.
It was actually kind of hard to meet people I found.
[whispering] I am not doing your dirty work for you.
[on phone] Hey Sasha, it's daddy.  Have you ever heard of this doll , Princess Unicorn?
You think I have a machine for measuring bee hives?
Um, yeah, ah, ah, that means a lot.  Thank you for saying it.
Alright, well then you can ask about religious beliefs.
I am so glad I got all of the dudes to do Movember. We have the dopest time back in the annex.
Ah, you should probably deal with that outside of the work place.
Hey, Andy, Nobody's calling you crazy, Andy. We're your friends, Andy.
So, how would you go about settling interpersonal conflicts within the office?
[sighing] Look, it's a free country. If she wants to throw a party...
Well for a minute there, I saw myself selling my house, moving to Costa Rica, learning how to surf. But, Costa Rica will still be there. When I'm 65.
Hey, uh... where'd you decide to take Karen tonight?
Think you could...[wants to hand the camera to Jim, but Jim is starting to snuggle up with Pam, posing.  Toby aims the camera, the flash pops up] Okay. [takes picture] Okay.
Um... in fact, basic rule of thumb, let's just act everyday like Pam's Mom's coming in. All right. That's it. Um... if anybody has any questions about anything, you know where I sit in the back.
Well, um, it was amazing.  It really was, thanks for asking.  Um the beaches were pristine...
It was Ryan wanted Michael, the subject, to explain the computer system, the object.
Well, it's one of my strengths, but it's the manager's job.
Uh, I really think that you need to address what happened with Stanley this morning...
[watch that Michael gave him beeps] Oh, some kind of... alarm.
Hey, Meredith.  Can I talk to you privately for a second?
It happens, okay? Uh, so let's just find an empty desk for you, and uh, I'm sure Robert will be with you as soon as he gets in.
Sunday church service... it's been a few years. The Big Guy and I, we got some catching up to do.
Hey, I just got the word on the communal birthdays. Great idea.
You gonna eat all that dog food yourself?
The Scranton strangler. George Howard Skub. Haven't I told you about the jury I was on a couple years ago?
I mean, what���s the end date? It must be really hard for her to sign on to be unhappy if she doesn���t know when it���s gonna end.
Oh, there's a whole 'nother terrorism booklet for that.
Oh, this looks great. I'd, I'd love to be there, but my daughter's play is tonight. ... Damnit! You know, one of the other parents will probably videotape it.
[sits down for his ID picture] Just take it. [flashes goes off, while he is standing back up again]
Every Friday at 4, I have a standing appointment with Dwight for him to file a grievance against Jim. I tell him that I'm sending them to a special file in New York. That box is the special file in New York.
Michael, I'm your HR Rep. I'm on your side.
Hey... [sees both Jim and Pam] you two.
But I mean���uh have you talked to her? Is sh���
The lady cop acted like she'd never pulled someone over for driving too slow.  And I tried to get out of it with the famous Toby Flenderson 10,000 watt smile. [smiles] It didn't work.
Kelly Kapoor is gone. Her fianc�� Ravi was hired as a pediatrics professor at Miami university.
...feel like I may have glossed over a few...
A guy on my street fell off a ladder painting his house.  It was on the news.
No, I would never ever do anything like that. But it does seem like something you would do.
You have to stop. [bangs on glass window]
I'd like you to imagine a place where you feel very peaceful. For me, it's the walk from the yogurt shop to my car after I drop my daughter off on Sunday afternoons.
He- he can't do that.  Turns out she's allowed to have feelings of sexual arousal.  It doesn't become a violation until she physically acts on it.
[to Darryl] Hey, you tricked me. You just wanted Kevin.
Say Anything, The Shining, Annie Hall, that's too obvious.
Absolutely. [Toby kisses Amy for an extended period of time, Pam and Jim are shocked]
You know but the police could have been out there you know, catching real criminals instead of here searching my stuff.
Angela, what do you want me to do?
I like it just us three.  [very quietly] I don't want it to change.
No, no, no, no, no. Women chase him. He misses his wife.
[Michael and Holly are still working on the chair] What'd you guys do?
Well, I really can't talk about it, but it's a very high profile case.
I'm sorry, if we did something to upset you, I'm sure it was inadvertent.
Look, you know, in any company  there's going to be certain degrees -
Yeah, it just means whoever complained came to me later and withdrew it, so I took their name off.
Michael, look.  I know this is hard for you, but death's just a part of life.  I mean, just this morning I saw a little bird fly into the glass doors downstairs and die.  And I had to keep going.
Okay, you get a one-second hold on the ball...
Yeah, um, but now apparently Darryl has some issue with his...
Casual Fridays are cancelled.  [everyone protests]  Let's just not do it anymore.
You know who's not gonna get to work on some exciting new startup this year? George Howard Skub, a.k.a. the alleged Scranton strangler, because he's in prison [Jim and Daryl walk out of the kitchen] for something he may not have done.
Hey, look what I found in the back. [shows a football to Pam] Wanna play? Teach you to throw.
So this is H.R. This is your desk.
Come on Michael. Those are all fake stories.
Oh, no, no. no. My plane just got in. From New York. Are you still with Piotr?
Two dimes, seven nickels--Well, okay, no, that doesn't add up. It was one quarter and--
[standing behind Erin] I don't think this fax is going through. Is there a different... I can just put it through again, you know.
Well, we still have to do the exit interview.
I w-, uh, I would love to give uh-
You just got your corporate credit card back. Do you really want me to take it away again?
Maybe not some of them. Maybe not inappropriate ones.
I just though you could add me.  I don't see the harm in that.
Well, we did a little investigation and Dwight had a good point.  The ladder didn't reach the top shelf.  I don't know if I believe it, but I am a fan of the hardboiled detective novel.  [impression] I'll punch you in da mush, see.
I heard about the hit.  Just-- make sure it's off company property, right?
Yeah, er... pull up a chair or sit on the shredder.
Alright, it's getting gooier so we'll just do it later.
Yeah, well... Not everybody has what we have.
Jan told me just a few minutes before she told you.
[opening kite from Ryan] Wow! Cause... [reveals Kite Runner book]
Sure. Wow. [Michael throws a pen at his head] Ow...
Miami University in Ohio. On her last day, Kelly was still a little confused about it
Okay, this isn���t over. Let���s stay focused, okay? ��We made fun of Andy earlier for getting beat up by a little girl, but... little things can be dangerous.
I should not be here. I���m in the- I was in the wrong- I���m- I���m sorry. Uh, just picture me back there. I- I was never here.
Oh, cool. It looks really interesting. What did you end up with? [Ryan pulls Creed's old coat out of a bag] Sorry.
I could loan you a pair of socks.
[walks up to Pam's desk with a binder] Hey Pam, could I talk to you for a sec?
You know, why don't we split the order? It's only fair.
Okay, that's hurtful talk. We've talked about that. You know, I don't interrupt your announcements.
Fingerprints can be planted. You know with a severed hand...
They would just send someone else. You need to have an HR representative.
I love it. I love it... I would love a picture of the two of us, to also take to Costa Rica.
Forcing your employees to set you up is not a, uh, uh, technical violation of any Dunder Mifflin rule.  You know, but neither is forcing them to help you with a shot-by-shot remake of Indiana Jones.  Huh-how do you make a rule book like that?
Well, it's important to support local art, you know. And what they do is not art.
Hey, is that Michael?  Does he miss me?  [laughs]  Uh, Oscar?  Are you there?  Hello? [sighs]
Well I just wanted to say I'm doing it. [Toby leaves]
He might start by asking each of you, ���Why do you think you���re here?���
The full story is that Randall resigned because of sexual harassment. So Corporate asked me to do a five minute review of the Company Sexual Harassment policy.
I really disagree with this. I think it's kind of hateful. Though I am a little happy right now to have a platform to talk about the outcome of a case I was recently a juror on. The Scranton Strangler. That man's being put to death. I was part of the verdict, and I'm not so sure he's guilty any more. [Dwight plays a clip from the song Oh Yeah: Ohhhh yeah! Chica chicaaa]
This is fun. You know? I mean, this is fun.
Guys, I think Michael and Luke are related.
Michael has been assigned six hours of mandatory counseling with a trained professional. I actually have a degree in social work. I mean, I know a lot of people would ask a few standard questions, and check off a few boxes, but I've got a chance to do some good here.
I don't know, I just thought you could include me.
Does it have to be pizza? Could go for a, falafel?
[in a hospital bed, watching Entourage in Spanish] Oh, I went zip lining my third day in Costa Rica.  I guess the harness wasn't strapped in exactly right.  I broke my neck.  And, I've been in the hospital five weeks now.  I still haven't seen the beach.  It's nice to have visitors.
Okay, I think we should probably be okay.
Yeah, I don't know why you picked names that are also guys' names.
You���re really there to talk to each other. I would say that the therapist is more of a facilitator.
Yes, uh some people in the office have complained...
Oh, you guys. Kelly called it. 2013. So s���hey! Hey! Hey, no! No! Get outta here. Clark, get outta here.
What was fun about it for you?  Was it the death of the twins?
[hands Meredith his camera] This one right here.
[sighs and pulls out a box under his desk] It's all Dwight's.
Alright, I wasn't expecting that. Let's uh... let's go draw.
Pete���s a pretty cool guy, though, and Andy was a terrible lover to Erin. He basically ignored her and left on a boat.
This is the prison. Uh, I am not going in there with expectations, per say. Uh, I will meet George Howard Scubb. I will tell him that I believe he is innocent. I would understand if he felt motivated to hug me. I would understand if a friendship began. How did, how did Bogart put it? [imitating Humphrey Bogart] I think this is a start of my first friendship.
Oh, when you sign your job application you agree to comply with random drug testing.
[to Phyllis and Stanley] What are you guys talking about? I have a daughter. How can I be a virgin?
Its really sad that your dog ran away. Why did it keep you from going to the park?
I don't know how I'm going to get through this. I don't want to lie and I DON'T want to tell the truth.
That is not mine.  I have never seen that before.
I don't think Pam's gonna want to come into the men's room.
It is real, thank you for saying that.
Well, as you know, Ed Truck passed away. So, I'm here to talk about it if anyone would like to.
Sorry. Hey, Toby Flenderson. Nice to meet you. How can I help?
If I won the lottery, I don't know. I don't think I'd make any changes to my life. Quit my job, move, meet someone....
Michael, We should contact some experts.  You don't know what your doing.
There's a bunch of people back here, maybe...
You know what Michael? You're right. You win. This is pointless. We're not getting anywhere. I got a bunch of fun stuff, in case my daughter ever comes over. Why don't we just run out the clock by playing games, drawing some pictures, talking?
Do you see David Wallace in the room right now?
The simple solution would be to open a window... if we had... windows that could open.
No, I mean he's attracted to other men.
Well, good.  We can, uh, throw that one out. [shuffles through papers]
I'm gonna really miss going to beers with you guys every Tuesday night [Pam holds up soda in salute, Meredith yells 'yeah!', Michael looks at camera] and lastly, I'd love to urge you to keep up with my fight to have the building checked for radon gas.  You know, it's a, it's a real serious matter, and every time I try to have the, uh...
Well, I was hoping that maybe in light of everything that's happened today, it would be a good idea if today, you, me, and Michael could head into the conference room for some conflict resolution.
I didn't put caprese salad in my drawer, Michael.
You know, Michael, sometimes my daughter's stomach hurts when there's a mean girl at school...
All right, well, let���s try one simple technique together. Okay, why doesn���t everyone stand? Okay, so... you���re being attacked. You���ve got your hands up. Simple palm strike to the chin. Up to the chin. One, two.
Well, and you have a... yes, a- d- another chateau.
Y'know I've been going over my notes from the trial...
Apparently you called Oscar 'faggie' for liking the movie Shakespeare in Love more than an action movie.
Believe me, she has enough toys... she doesn't need your watch.
Okay, look, in a real crisis situation, you���re not gonna have to time to think, okay? So just remember, I-A-A-T-G. ���It���s all about the groin.���
Michael's behavior is erratic and unpredictable, but I don't think he's doing drugs. Maybe he should. Take the edge off. Uh, not at work, of course.
Hey, what's going on?  You don't have my permission to do this.
I think we might be about to maybe really get somewhere.
Yeah, Michael asked about it once. I just pretended not to hear him. He left.
I don't really play cards, but I'm not gonna lie to you. It felt really good to take money from Michael. Gonna chase that feeling.
Uh, well, we probably don't want to go just on seniority.
I don���t know if this is gonna help...Uh...
I like to think Lloyd Gross is a no-nonsense guy who doesn���t back down from anybody. And he calls people ���Kimosabe���.
Yeah, I also learned some interesting things about how they structure...
Um... I need to talk to you in your office. It'll just take two seconds.
I'm, I'm not gonna comment on my personal life.
You can't fire Pete. You understand why, right?
No, no,... no. Sorry. We cut Kevin off for the same thing. You have to have something to say, if you talk. [Angela rolls her eyes and stops talking]
I know people are only this excited to talk to me because of the trial. But, they talk to me for a while, and maybe people realize I have something to say. And then one day, we're just talking.
I always thought he might have been set up but I felt pressured to convict.
[fending Andy off] Oh, come on. Andy, no.
[leans hobo sack against the refrigerator] It's a great stick, right?
Well you know Michael, I have a brother in Boulder. Rory Flenderson. You should look him up.
If you really want to have kids, I--- I guess you could somehow... foster parent, or something.
Fine, I'll take your name off. [looks at Michael] So no one will know.
But I-- I promised my daughter. Darryl, look-- I-- I need the doll, I need the doll.  I-- I'm-- I'm begging you.  I just-- I need it more than anything in this world.  I need this doll. Darryl, man I need this doll.
Yeah. I have my dignity too. I refuse to be another man's horsey.
Really? You were gonna throw out a book?
Well, I don't think there's any reason to check 'em but I suppose if we wanted to be really certain...
Oh, Michael, you can't ask about religious beliefs...
Well, Kelly's been so upset about Ryan dumping her, that she can't even talk. [grins]
Well, I am trained in grief counseling, but, ahh, I don't think that's what they need right now.
[spying at Darryl's house] Sounds like a EMDP-40.
Well, you're going to have to let 'em out. Or... or I will.
This here is a radon test kit. [holding out tiny cylinder disc] Okay I will be putting 'em everywhere. And... please don't throw these out. [starts snapping towards Michael's face] This is a radon test kit. [continues snapping] Please don't throw these out. [Michael gives annoyed look] See them all over the office.
Yes, that's true. I have never won a Dundie. I am more than okay  with that.
It's a little tricky, you might have to... take... [Mose speeds away]
[singing and dancing] Dem bones, dem bones, dem tired bones, now we're the skeleton crew.
I really didn't think I was going to have a good time, but I did. Totally did.
This may be the first time that a male subordinate has attempted to get a modest scheduled raise by threatening to withhold sex from a female superior.  It will be a groundbreaking case when it inevitably goes to trial.
Michael, can I talk to you for a uh, second please?
I'm makin' great time. Usually I have to take a bathroom break half way through a race like this, but not today.
How will your experience selling refinery equipment translate to our smaller scale here?
You know, sometimes I wish we just didn't have a conference room. [Kelly laughs] You know? He couldn't do that.
Chad Flendermen. Just an easy going black guy, he knows the streets, yet he also went to Oxford. So. Just as comfortable on a motorcycle as he is on Air Force One. Oh and he's also the world's leading Egyptologist.
Uh, about a week. Er... .um... .maybe a month. I uh can't...
I love The Finer Things Club.  My ex-wife used to have a book club, and I would read their book and sometimes listen from the kitchen.
I would spend a lot of time launching my true crime podcast, The Flenderson Files. Dum bum buh. [whispers] Flenderson files.
Ok, um, one thing that you're gonna want to look out for is carpal tunnel syndrome.  It's recommended that you take a ten minute break from typing every hour.  For your circulation, you're gonna want to get up out of your chairs and uh, and move around about ten minutes every hour.
I already signed it. I was just showing you.
Alright, just know that you're not in the Finer Things Club.
To whomever, meaning us, the indirect object. Which is the correct usage of the word.
OK, I am telling you, Oscar is an actual homosexual.  Yeah, he told me this morning.  And, obviously he hopes he can count on your discretion.
I can neither confirm nor deny this. Let's just say I'll be up to my neck in jury duty. [excited outbursts]
...about some other people engaging in PDA and, you know [Michael leans in closer to Toby] I just wanted to remind it's not appropriate to, to do that.
Self-defense is not some fun boxing match, okay? This is about escaping with your life. So... strike, scream, and run. All right? Let���s try it.
You know it���s not just pregnant women who don���t get their due. You know who���s gorgeous? Helen Mirren.
This is great.  My ex-wife's going to be so pissed.  [chuckles] For once daddy's gonna be a hero.
I have like, like a blue shirt? I don't wear a lot of colors, I have a lot of tan. Uh huh.
It's very important for you to be liked, isn't it?
I made it this far, right? What's the point?
Michael. Why's everyone locked in the conference room?
It's digital, so just take as many as you want.
Do- Well you should give him a little time to settle in. But-
All right, look, what you gotta understand is that when you come to work, you give up certain rights.
Michael, do you have the name of the employee you're letting go? I'd like to start working on out-placement.
You--you might consider pulling it down a touch.  It's ri--it's riding up a little high.
Yeah, I assumed Michael was already doing this.  That's why I only use my personal e-mail account.
Yeah, I guess it will be my, uh, thing in Costa Rica, be a nature photographer.
Michael, we are only allowed to talk about Meredith's work performance. We can not ask her to stop drinking.
Ok, I can't count the hour if you don't talk.
���..Chad Flendermen's kryptonite. [Darryl walks up to Toby and Val in a tuxedo]
I guess I shouldn't have stopped for dinner.
So remember, intent is irrelevant. And that's it. Pam?
If we don't patronise the only Syrian restaurant in town, there'll be nothing left but pan pizzas and make-your-own salads.
Can't you just not look at his feet?
[tossing forms at Michael] Just fill them out any way you want.
This is a picture I've been carrying around in my wallet for about six years.  It's this unspoiled beach in Costa Rica, Playa Grande.  Um, I take it out when I get stressed or depressed, and it really calms me down.  Never thought I'd get to live here, you know.  But it turns out they built these great new condos there, so, this could be me, right around, uh, where the trees used to be.
It's not.  It's not.  Sit down or I am writing you up.
I prefer being stuck in a Costa Rican hospital.
Toby, you are playing a dangerous game. Guess I'm through the gateway now, though, right?
Yeah. Um, you mind if I get a picture?
Hey, what's going on? There's a police car in the...
Hi, I'm uh, Toby Flenderson. I'm here to see George Howard Scubb.
Well, I was in the Seminary for a year and dropped out 'cause I wanted to have sex with this girl, Cathy.  Followed her to Scranton.  Took the first job I could find in H.R.  Later she divorced me.  So no, I wouldn't say I have a passion for H.R.
Honestly, I don't even hear her anymore. It's like waves crashing against the beach.
Except you just told me you were gonna make it up. Now if she sues, I have to testify against you.
Hey Dwight. Pretty nice robe- [Dwight grabs bag with robe in it and walks away.] Why?
Didn't you lose a lot of money on that other investment, the one from the email?
These things just have a way of working themselves out.
It's just a little dispute over a poster in their workspace.
I���ve seen guys like you. Big guys who like to push the little guys around. Lloyd Gross eats bullies like you for breakfast.
I will send this off to corporate.  Make sure you hold on to your medical bills.  Feel better.
[gets up and puts a hand on Michael's shoulder] Buddy, I think that...
It is enough of this. Everyone, let���s go back to work.
When I put it in I thought it would be a waste of time, but I guess it was worth it.
[crosses finish line] And the winner is Toby Flenderson.
[answering phone] This is Toby. Hey Pam. Where are you calling from?
I'm going to the prison. This afternoon. I'm gonna talk to the strangler.
Uh, we're on recess. I came for the party. Hey, everyone.
You filled them in and faxed them yourself!
No, no, no. It's not fair. What if Kevin wants to buy cookies from me?
Oh thanks.  She's gonna... [notices the doll is black] oh...
Hey, this came with the Stamford book. [Sets down box that says: Personnel Files Stamford CT Office Confidential] Can you take care of it?
Oh, it wasn't camping, it was more of a wilderness retreat. [Michael walks in]
It's out of context.  It's not the same as driving.
You know what would be the hottest thing ever? It���s a pregnant Helen Mirren.
You know, when I was on j-duty, uh, Strangler case, we used to recreate the various stranglings with empanadas from- at Ernesto's.
Ah, this reminds me of the HR convention last fall.
Hey guys.  This is my, uh, girlfriend, Amy.
But now it's being looked at as more of a productivity issue.
Okay, I���m at what���s called ���the decision point.���
It's a dead animal in an office. You can't...
Yeah, uh, she'll be starting next week. If you have any questions about the transition, just let me know.
...and, yeah, the whole thing was incredibly cathartic.
Oh, I don���t know. I might turn in early.
Michael, I have one extra twin bed, if you want.
I think these belong to you. [puts toys down on desk]
Actually, she's right. This isn't appropriate. Why don't I take these.
No.  It's even-- it's even better than the one I wanted.
Maybe you could just take the rest of the day off... you know...
Shortly after Kelly left, Ryan quit and also moved to Ohio, for what he claimed were unrelated reasons.
We should really have the office's air quality tested. We have radon coming from below, we have asbestos in the ceilings. These are silent killers.
Hey, I'd like to buy one of your dolls.
Oscar says I checked out huh?  Huh. [nods head]
Erin, HR is a joke. I can't do anything about anything.
[on speakerphone] Well you know, frankly a lot of us have been saying this for a long time.
Hey, we're not all going to sit in a circle Indian style are we? [Laughing]
I can't believe this. [mistaking Darryl's sister for Darryl] Hey you, ass****!
I could, sure. Have a seat. I would start at the beginning, but I think I need to go farther back.
Ok, I mean, I could talk to her.
Oh, wow, this is, uh, just a mystery novel that I've been working on.
Hi, do you mind if I sign the card real quick?
Kevin.  His gambling problem must've resurfaced. I'm gonna have to send him home until I can do an investigation.
Sorry guys, but I don't think I tipped him for last year's.
Well I guess this weddings not going to happen.  I wonder if this is it for them.  [Jim and Pam walk in laughing]
Oh, sure, lots of times. Yeah. Wait, you and Pam aren���t in couple���s counseling, are you? Oh, God.
Just letting Oscar vent a little. We would use the break room, but the photographer's back there today.
Uh, no, the opposite. I was actually selected to be a juror on a very high-profile case.
Alright, well look. While I have you here, this is a relationship disclosure form for Pete & Erin.
That... [shakes head and places hand over the file]
There were two or three 'sorry's in there. [mumbles along with Nellie]
That really hurt. I'm writing you up. [Angela makes an angry face] Hey, you are not allowed to touch other employees. Am I being clear?
You know I don't have to do the paperwork unless you're actually dating.
I don't think the women in this office -
Well the 'fun' is in it. [conference room group chimes agreement.]
Hey, hey what are- why are you doing this?
I-- I don���t know if there���s truth to-- to, uh, to that.
Andy, you know I can���t do that. It���d be lying.
How are you? Hey. Welcome back. [puts out fist to bump]
I don't report to you, Michael. I report to the head of HR in New York.
You mean food truck. Ernesto's was a food truck.
I'll have Erin fax them back to corporate.
Thanks, I'm gonna set it to Costa Rica time.
I called Tallahassee. He can ask you not to come in, but he can't dock your pay. That's not legal.
Actually, I have a separate folder for complaints against Michael. This [unlocks a drawer]is January through March of this year. [pulls out a fairly large folder]
I'm gonna... I'll go get one. Stay. [runs out of the office]
Robert did say you'd be joining us. Welcome. I'm Tony.
[gesturing to the rest of the office] This is everybody else... okay... This is the place... so thanks for the lift.
We should stay to maybe some more traditional models...
Michael, this is really inappropriate to talk about.
There's not a single appropriate outfit in this whole--except mine, quite honestly.
I'm just saying I don't think it's appropriate for you to have given Ryan that award.
Office relationships are never a good idea. Yeah. So let's just try to avoid them. But, um, if you already have one, you should disclose it to HR.
OK I think Oscar would just like if you used 'lame' or something like that.
It���s interesting that you���re drawn to the point of view of the attacker. ��You would like the turn of the table. Okay, the latest Chad Flenderman novel... [everyone groans] written from the point of view of his nemesis, Dr. Lucifer Wu.
You can't, [Michael touches his forehead and makes sizzling noise] Ow. Look, you cannot push religion.
[Michael hands him a present] Wow, thanks, Michael, I...
Michael, nine different people emailed me that photo, including my ex-wife... we don't talk now.
You can't claim territories. This is the only place I interact with people. Can't you sell at your church or barber shop? [Darryl looks hurt] Or chess club, or?
Hey Darryl, look ahhh, we're here to apologize ahh...
I spent three years in advertising before I came here.
You know, for your own protection, you should disclose the relationship to HR.
I don't... I don't think we can do that.
I normally do nothing, I guess. No, you shouldn't- [Holly knocks on Michael's door]
[excitedly] Oh, I should get the accident report binder. I've never used the gun violence forms before.
So Dwight and Darryl came to an agreement that both would file complaints with corporate and now I get to do all this paperwork.  We worked it out.
Uh, you know what, I can go park it myself.
Thanks... [Hank is standing next to Michael] Really, Michael?
[alone in cab} After Dwight fired me, I moved to New York to write the great American novel. I have six roommates. Heh. Which are better than friends, you know ���cause they have to give you one month���s notice before they leave.
Yeah, um... I can���t believe you remembered. I do self-defense. Um, I���ll go put on my cup.
Hey, text from the old wife. Gonna take that. [runs outside]
Actually, I didn't think it was appropriate to invite children since it's... You know, there's gambling and alcohol, and it's in our dangerous warehouse and it's a school night... And, you know, Hooters is catering. You know, is that enough? Should I keep going?
...and you bounce it off the wall on your side of the tape.
I was-- I was gonna get the doll.
Guys, it's a really big deal. [rubs his neck]
[to passing female pedestrian] Smile if you love men���s prostates.
Me, Dan from Buffalo, Mark Chisholm, Jeff from Albany and Ryan, obviously. Made so many s'mores, that I finally had to say, 'No more s'mores, no more s'mores.' [everyone in room but Michael laughs, Michael exits break room]
Michael, it's up to me to check off the boxes, and I can't do that unless I honestly...
[Creed takes a bite of an apple] Creed is eating an apple.  I found a potato.
She's going to be screaming her own last name?
I am on the wrong side, and I am freaking out here.
Yeah. So anyway, the entire jury wants me to vote guilty. But then I did a little research of my own, and forget everything you thought you knew about fingerprinting.
I'd say all the goofing around at Pam's desk, and, and hanging out with Pam, has finally caught up to him... w-with Pam
Well, why would you need relocation, if you already live in Scranton?
Well, we could try him out for a little while... [Jim drops his pen, looks exasperated] and if it doesn't work out, you know, maybe one of us could, you know, step in...
That was the right decision for me and my marriage.
Yeah, okay. Corporate would like us to do a five minute review of the Company Sexual Harassment policy so I'll go over that later.
[laughs] Oh man, thanks, thank you, [tearing up] thank you, thank you.
Alright... Well, um, if you really believe that Stanley was joking...
There���s two new guys back there with me now. They���re in their 20s. And we really get along.
Okay.  And-- the-the power-- comes from the back foot.  So its-- its all one motion through the-- body.  So you stay a little low and there's a twist.  You keep your shoulder down and you kind of throw out the arm.  [demonstrates punch] Pow!
