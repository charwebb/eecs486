I didn't think you were.
Write your own damn novel.
Yeah, could we...
I was-- I was gonna get the doll.
Oh, yeah, no, it���s okay. I can handle it. Um, so���
...using her own money...
What, what happened?
It wasn't a vote. You decided.
We should really have the office's air quality tested. We have radon coming from below, we have asbestos in the ceilings. These are silent killers.
Get over there!  Get over there!
Well, it's important to support local art, you know. And what they do is not art.
I got lost.
Oh, there's a whole 'nother terrorism booklet for that.
I can refer you to someone to talk to.
Hey, what is this?
I think these belong to you. [puts toys down on desk]
Maybe not some of them. Maybe not inappropriate ones.
To madness. [Robert laughs]
Yeah.
Hey, want my sun screen?
Oh, sure.
[to Phyllis and Stanley] What are you guys talking about? I have a daughter. How can I be a virgin?
Um... nothing comes to mind. [clip montage]
[on phone] Hey Sasha, it's daddy.  Have you ever heard of this doll , Princess Unicorn?
Michael, this is really inappropriate to talk about.
Me, Dan from Buffalo, Mark Chisholm, Jeff from Albany and Ryan, obviously. Made so many s'mores, that I finally had to say, 'No more s'mores, no more s'mores.' [everyone in room but Michael laughs, Michael exits break room]
Alright, it's getting gooier so we'll just do it later.
We should stay to maybe some more traditional models...
I'm... here, Jan.
[smiling] Okay.
That's not a very good Darryl.
It's, uh, it's HR stuff.
No, I would never ever do anything like that. But it does seem like something you would do.
[crosses finish line] And the winner is Toby Flenderson.
Come on Michael. Those are all fake stories.
Well, you know, Stanley was openly insubordinate.
[sighing] Look, it's a free country. If she wants to throw a party...
Yeah, it's great, isn't it?
I spent three years in advertising before I came here.
Yeah, I'm really looking forward to working with you, Michael.
Hey.
Michael's behavior is erratic and unpredictable, but I don't think he's doing drugs. Maybe he should. Take the edge off. Uh, not at work, of course.
Michael?
Well, I do. Always ready for adventure.
Uh, I really think that you need to address what happened with Stanley this morning...
I'm sorry, if we did something to upset you, I'm sure it was inadvertent.
Yeah.
Well you know Michael, I have a brother in Boulder. Rory Flenderson. You should look him up.
Okay, that is fine to feel, but not to act on.
Hey, look what I found in the back. [shows a football to Pam] Wanna play? Teach you to throw.
Fingerprints can be planted. You know with a severed hand...
Oh, Jesus!
Well, I really can't talk about it, but it's a very high profile case.
Chicken piccata, side salad.
I'm running this meeting.
Just the once.
Really?
He's gonna ruin everything.
Okay.
Uh, about a week. Er... .um... .maybe a month. I uh can't...
So you have played it before?
Um, if, uh... um... I just completely forgot what I was going to say. It's so weird.
But I mean���uh have you talked to her? Is sh���
Let's just wait and see what happens. [whispers] You know?
Nothing.
I don't know, I just thought you could include me.
Michael, it's up to me to check off the boxes, and I can't do that unless I honestly...
Well, I was hoping that maybe in light of everything that's happened today, it would be a good idea if today, you, me, and Michael could head into the conference room for some conflict resolution.
Oh, Jim. Hey.
And uh, yeah, plus it was hot.
What?
That's so cool.
But I-- I promised my daughter. Darryl, look-- I-- I need the doll, I need the doll.  I-- I'm-- I'm begging you.  I just-- I need it more than anything in this world.  I need this doll. Darryl, man I need this doll.
Office relationships are never a good idea. Yeah. So let's just try to avoid them. But, um, if you already have one, you should disclose it to HR.
Yeah, um... I can���t believe you remembered. I do self-defense. Um, I���ll go put on my cup.
Actually, I have a separate folder for complaints against Michael. This [unlocks a drawer]is January through March of this year. [pulls out a fairly large folder]
89.
And Pam Beesly.
Angela, what do you want me to do?
Thanks... [Hank is standing next to Michael] Really, Michael?
[in a hospital bed, watching Entourage in Spanish] Oh, I went zip lining my third day in Costa Rica.  I guess the harness wasn't strapped in exactly right.  I broke my neck.  And, I've been in the hospital five weeks now.  I still haven't seen the beach.  It's nice to have visitors.
Well, I am trained in grief counseling, but, ahh, I don't think that's what they need right now.
Bears.
Christmas.
Well, you can actually fire him.
Yeah, the ball-throwing exercise is in the binder. It's in the section marked, 'Fun Ways To Make Brainstorming Sessions Explode With Excitement and Creativity.'
What was fun about it for you?  Was it the death of the twins?
What?
It's over.
This is great.  My ex-wife's going to be so pissed.  [chuckles] For once daddy's gonna be a hero.
Mm-hmm.
Looks like we kicked it. [indicates water jug is empty]
All right, come.  Sit down, Dwight.
[gets up and puts a hand on Michael's shoulder] Buddy, I think that...
I'm allergic to mushrooms.
What... you can't... Gabe? Are you...
[Michael hands him a present] Wow, thanks, Michael, I...
Clean it in your car.
Don't search my stuff.
That is-- that is a loaded question.
Well that's sweet, I missed you guys too.
Okay, that is not true.
Thanks.
Oh, one more!
I want to introduce you to...
Alright, I wasn't expecting that. Let's uh... let's go draw.
The simple solution would be to open a window... if we had... windows that could open.
[hands Meredith his camera] This one right here.
But why?
Mineral-ey.
I'm, I'm not gonna comment on my personal life.
What?
It is real, thank you for saying that.
I remember.
Second?
It's Beach Day...
[spying at Darryl's house] Sounds like a EMDP-40.
I did leave.
Toby, you are playing a dangerous game. Guess I'm through the gateway now, though, right?
Yes.
No.  It's even-- it's even better than the one I wanted.
I don't know.
Well, I don't see it that way.
Well, that has wheels.
This may be the first time that a male subordinate has attempted to get a modest scheduled raise by threatening to withhold sex from a female superior.  It will be a groundbreaking case when it inevitably goes to trial.
I'm just saying I don't think it's appropriate for you to have given Ryan that award.
I made it this far, right? What's the point?
Every Friday at 4, I have a standing appointment with Dwight for him to file a grievance against Jim. I tell him that I'm sending them to a special file in New York. That box is the special file in New York.
I love their sandwiches.
Well, we did a little investigation and Dwight had a good point.  The ladder didn't reach the top shelf.  I don't know if I believe it, but I am a fan of the hardboiled detective novel.  [impression] I'll punch you in da mush, see.
It's very important for you to be liked, isn't it?
Ah, you should probably deal with that outside of the work place.
[laughs] Oh man, thanks, thank you, [tearing up] thank you, thank you.
Well, um, it was amazing.  It really was, thanks for asking.  Um the beaches were pristine...
Uh-huh.
Did you?
I'm makin' great time. Usually I have to take a bathroom break half way through a race like this, but not today.
All right... sorry... sorry about that.
More like 'Everyone let's get your boss laid Saturday.' [more laughs] [Toby puts his hand on Pam's knee, everyone stares, Toby removes his hand] I have an announcement uh, to make. I am moving to Costa Rica. Thought about it for a long time now. And I'm finally gonna do it. So, I'm just gonna hop the fence and jog home now. [runs out of lobby and climbs the fence and jogs away]
It's just a birthday card.
I'm gonna really miss going to beers with you guys every Tuesday night [Pam holds up soda in salute, Meredith yells 'yeah!', Michael looks at camera] and lastly, I'd love to urge you to keep up with my fight to have the building checked for radon gas.  You know, it's a, it's a real serious matter, and every time I try to have the, uh...
Oh, sure, lots of times. Yeah. Wait, you and Pam aren���t in couple���s counseling, are you? Oh, God.
Hey Dwight.
Johnny Depp.
It was Ryan wanted Michael, the subject, to explain the computer system, the object.
No, no.
Actually, I didn't think it was appropriate to invite children since it's... You know, there's gambling and alcohol, and it's in our dangerous warehouse and it's a school night... And, you know, Hooters is catering. You know, is that enough? Should I keep going?
Okay, that's hurtful talk. We've talked about that. You know, I don't interrupt your announcements.
What do you need?
You know, I always knew if Michael just took the time to get to know me, we'd become friends.
Um, ex-wife. Yeah. Um, her last name is 'Becker' now.
[on the phone] It was terrible.
Fine, I'll take your name off. [looks at Michael] So no one will know.
He seems fine.
Kelly Kapoor is gone. Her fianc�� Ravi was hired as a pediatrics professor at Miami university.
Just keep going.
Hey, Andy, Nobody's calling you crazy, Andy. We're your friends, Andy.
Come on, Michael. You're interrupting.
You--you might consider pulling it down a touch.  It's ri--it's riding up a little high.
Yeah.
No. They���re just regular men.
I should get back to work.
Y'know I've been going over my notes from the trial...
Hi guys.
Okay, okay, I'm going.
Well, what���s a little while?
Yeah, I don't know why you picked names that are also guys' names.
[dancing with Pam] [sobbing]
It was obvious...
Wish it were true, but it, it uh, seems from that photo that you took, you've entered into an intimate relationship.
I don't really play cards, but I'm not gonna lie to you. It felt really good to take money from Michael. Gonna chase that feeling.
Come on.
Frustrating.
It���s going to be nice to have just a healthy, young, fit presence in the middle of the office.
I should not be here. I���m in the- I was in the wrong- I���m- I���m sorry. Uh, just picture me back there. I- I was never here.
Oh, Andy, we had this exact same conversation when you wanted to get rid of Nellie. You can't just get rid of people over grudges.
You can't do that.
I'd like to introduce you to my replacement.
[sits down for his ID picture] Just take it. [flashes goes off, while he is standing back up again]
I love it. I love it... I would love a picture of the two of us, to also take to Costa Rica.
There's some right there.
Didn't you lose a lot of money on that other investment, the one from the email?
Okay, you get a one-second hold on the ball...
Let's just wait.
I can go over it with you.
Okay, this is what���s called pre-violent posturing.
Hey! [extremely loud gunshot]
The lady cop acted like she'd never pulled someone over for driving too slow.  And I tried to get out of it with the famous Toby Flenderson 10,000 watt smile. [smiles] It didn't work.
Hey, Jim!
Oh, no, I-- no, no, I was gonna buy that doll.
Uh huh.
Well, as you know, Dwight has filed a lot of complaints against you over the years.
A guy on my street fell off a ladder painting his house.  It was on the news.
Yeah, I also learned some interesting things about how they structure...
Hey, um did you go to uh, Bishop O'Hara?
About seven.
Hey, Jim.
[standing in the church sanctuary, talking to the stained glass] Why you always got to be so mean to me?
Yeah. Yeah, I don���t think���
I don't really think people are in the laughing mood.
Okay, then, Andy.
Well, Eric's just going over some stuff.
I'm Toby.
Here. [hands Pam a duck stuffed animal]
I w-, uh, I would love to give uh-
Yeah, maybe when you get really comfortable with each other, you can ask for that.
This place, um...
Does it have to be pizza? Could go for a, falafel?
Oh, it wasn't camping, it was more of a wilderness retreat. [Michael walks in]
[whispering] John Stamos.
Hey, what's going on?  You don't have my permission to do this.
You think I have a machine for measuring bee hives?
Why?
Um, why don't you go ask him that?
Not really.
Well, it... there was. But Michael scheduled it for 4:58 on a Friday. You know, people sang in the parking lot.
Alright, well look. While I have you here, this is a relationship disclosure form for Pete & Erin.
Well, we could try him out for a little while... [Jim drops his pen, looks exasperated] and if it doesn't work out, you know, maybe one of us could, you know, step in...
No.
Um... in fact, basic rule of thumb, let's just act everyday like Pam's Mom's coming in. All right. That's it. Um... if anybody has any questions about anything, you know where I sit in the back.
[confused] W-What?
[unwraps present; present is a rock with a Post-It note rubber-banded to it; reads] 'Suck on this.'
So great.
Colorblind.
No, No, No.  No, I'm just curious if you've heard of it.
Umm... After my divorce. Yeah.
Who was the main character?
Did you even read it?
Sorry guys, but I don't think I tipped him for last year's.
No.
The full story is that Randall resigned because of sexual harassment. So Corporate asked me to do a five minute review of the Company Sexual Harassment policy.
What?
Morning.
Well for a minute there, I saw myself selling my house, moving to Costa Rica, learning how to surf. But, Costa Rica will still be there. When I'm 65.
Yeah, uh, she'll be starting next week. If you have any questions about the transition, just let me know.
Great point.
We're really not supposed to serve alcohol.
[nods] ...You know, I, uh, I know a little about what you're going through in a way. Um, when I was a kid, my parents got divorced. They both wanted custody, and they both asked me to testify against the other one in court. So, I don't know, I didn't want them getting divorced in the first place you know? I loved them both so much. I just wanted... [Michael pushes Toby's food tray off the table and walks off]
Not Jan.
I've been drafting a letter.
Yeah... that's why they pay me the big bucks.  [both laugh]
Who are you seeing? That's gr���
Can���t. I took a course at the Weintraub Memory Academy. I sat next to this woman named Beverly Brook. She had a Greek salad for lunch. See what I mean?
And that's how you broke your ankle?
Michael. Why's everyone locked in the conference room?
That really hurt. I'm writing you up. [Angela makes an angry face] Hey, you are not allowed to touch other employees. Am I being clear?
Sure.
Think you could...[wants to hand the camera to Jim, but Jim is starting to snuggle up with Pam, posing.  Toby aims the camera, the flash pops up] Okay. [takes picture] Okay.
I would love that.
I'm gonna... I'll go get one. Stay. [runs out of the office]
I love The Finer Things Club.  My ex-wife used to have a book club, and I would read their book and sometimes listen from the kitchen.
Yes, that's true. I have never won a Dundie. I am more than okay  with that.
[whispering] I am not doing your dirty work for you.
He couldn't have made it a circle?
Yeah.
I'll call.
No.
Dwight, you cannot keep that here.
So, how would you go about settling interpersonal conflicts within the office?
Well, it's one of my strengths, but it's the manager's job.
That���s true. There���s no rule. You can check the employee handbook. Oh, can I check the employee handbook Lloyd? Well, does it say anything about me choking a man with my bare hands?
Sure.
Ahhh, kay.  Look, we could all file complaints against each other and just drown in a sea of paperwork, but you know, we can just move on with our... with our lives.
Guys. Really, it's ok. Everyone has made a really solid first impression, I don't think there's any reason for anybody to worry.
Erin, HR is a joke. I can't do anything about anything.
I heard about the hit.  Just-- make sure it's off company property, right?
Okay, I'm lost.
You're welcome.
Yeah...
No!
[answering phone] This is Toby. Hey Pam. Where are you calling from?
Uh, no, the opposite. I was actually selected to be a juror on a very high-profile case.
I'd like you to imagine a place where you feel very peaceful. For me, it's the walk from the yogurt shop to my car after I drop my daughter off on Sunday afternoons.
I--I could--I could talk about it.
Yes.
Uh... Human Resources.
You gonna eat all that dog food yourself?
Lady...you never stop surprising me.
Oh, this looks great. I'd, I'd love to be there, but my daughter's play is tonight. ... Damnit! You know, one of the other parents will probably videotape it.
Of course not!
Oh, Happy Birthday.
I am so glad I got all of the dudes to do Movember. We have the dopest time back in the annex.
I thought I was T-Dog.
Sedentary.
Of course.
You know what would be the hottest thing ever? It���s a pregnant Helen Mirren.
I've got some ideas, I guess...
...building looked into...
All right, now Oscar's feeling discriminated against by his co-workers, primarily Angela, and um, that's your fault.
Uh, yes!
Yes.
They would just send someone else. You need to have an HR representative.
I normally do nothing, I guess. No, you shouldn't- [Holly knocks on Michael's door]
Michael!
...feel like I may have glossed over a few...
Well, you know, 'cause of  the trains.
Now, we���re actually a lot closer to Binghamton than you are. Kimosabe.
Well thanks Michael.
[sighs]
I don't think laughing about it is an appropriate response.
Hey, this came with the Stamford book. [Sets down box that says: Personnel Files Stamford CT Office Confidential] Can you take care of it?
Hey, hey what are- why are you doing this?
Uh-huh.
I'm sorry, what is your three-step plan?
[standing behind Erin] I don't think this fax is going through. Is there a different... I can just put it through again, you know.
It was just...
I am supposed to collect eyewitness accounts. Who saw Dwight do this? [all raise their hands]
Is anyone having any trouble eating?
Oh, really good.
Why?
To whomever, meaning us, the indirect object. Which is the correct usage of the word.
[Creed takes a bite of an apple] Creed is eating an apple.  I found a potato.
Okay, I think we should probably be okay.
Hi, Jan.
Oh... uh...
Yeah, it just means whoever complained came to me later and withdrew it, so I took their name off.
Oh.
Forcing your employees to set you up is not a, uh, uh, technical violation of any Dunder Mifflin rule.  You know, but neither is forcing them to help you with a shot-by-shot remake of Indiana Jones.  Huh-how do you make a rule book like that?
There's this female uh, uh, stenographer at the courthouse...
I don't... I don't think we can do that.
Uh, ok.
It's not.  It's not.  Sit down or I am writing you up.
I was...
[walks in] Hey everyone.
Can you stop...
[to Kevin] Honestly, is there any way you can get on your fiancee's plan? Our health plan is s... just... it's terrible.
It is enough of this. Everyone, let���s go back to work.
No, no.  Um, you always want to keep a sweater or cardigan of some sort, in case it gets drafty.
No.
No, it's nothing. We'll just... [shakes hand]
I would spend a lot of time launching my true crime podcast, The Flenderson Files. Dum bum buh. [whispers] Flenderson files.
You just got your corporate credit card back. Do you really want me to take it away again?
Come on.
Mm-hmm.
Yes.
Andy, you know I can���t do that. It���d be lying.
I knew it. I knew it from the beginning it was possible.
Where are we?
I just really like you.
Alright... Well, um, if you really believe that Stanley was joking...
Okay. Good point...
Well, why would you need relocation, if you already live in Scranton?
Yeah, me too.
Apparently you called Oscar 'faggie' for liking the movie Shakespeare in Love more than an action movie.
So it's like volleyball.
Yeah, and I, uh, I think that the very fact that we're including it in our agenda frankly, is a big step forward.
I'm not going to punch you, Michael.
Um, can you make it eleven?
Yeah.
Hey, Stanley...
No.
Hey guys that's really inappropriate.
So, hey, you wanna trade?
It's digital, so just take as many as you want.
A girl.
Can I talk to you a second?
I... I can't do that.
I'm going to the prison. This afternoon. I'm gonna talk to the strangler.
I don���t...
Hey.
Alright, just know that you're not in the Finer Things Club.
Hey, what happened?
Dead.
[to passing female pedestrian] Smile if you love men���s prostates.
No, why would I punch you?
[walks up to Pam's desk with a binder] Hey Pam, could I talk to you for a sec?
Alright, well then you can ask about religious beliefs.
Oh, Dwight, we talked about this.
In meetings.
They do. That they do.
I can't believe this. [mistaking Darryl's sister for Darryl] Hey you, ass****!
Guys, I think Michael and Luke are related.
[watch that Michael gave him beeps] Oh, some kind of... alarm.
I just want to...
That's no burst pipe.
Oh, no, no. no. My plane just got in. From New York. Are you still with Piotr?
She's going to be screaming her own last name?
Uh, no, that's okay.
Sure. Wow. [Michael throws a pen at his head] Ow...
It's out of context.  It's not the same as driving.
Hi, Kevin. Look, I need to talk to you about-
Michael, can I talk to you for a uh, second please?
Well, the most common scenario is a larger man attacking a smaller female.
It has been a long, lonely winter.
What? I was just explaining--
No.  Can't, can't you just get up yourself?  I... You only grilled your foot.
No not really...
You really did it...
Oh, I don���t know. I might turn in early.
Well, it's for Angela, so ..
Been to Amsterdam.
I prefer being stuck in a Costa Rican hospital.
Whoa.
He has a doctor's note.
Hey I need to talk to you right now.
Well, we still have to do the exit interview.
Hey, text from the old wife. Gonna take that. [runs outside]
We want to go home.
I know people are only this excited to talk to me because of the trial. But, they talk to me for a while, and maybe people realize I have something to say. And then one day, we're just talking.
Happy birthday!
Ok, um, one thing that you're gonna want to look out for is carpal tunnel syndrome.  It's recommended that you take a ten minute break from typing every hour.  For your circulation, you're gonna want to get up out of your chairs and uh, and move around about ten minutes every hour.
I called Tallahassee. He can ask you not to come in, but he can't dock your pay. That's not legal.
It happens, okay? Uh, so let's just find an empty desk for you, and uh, I'm sure Robert will be with you as soon as he gets in.
Yes.
Hey Michael.
Sure.
Good luck.
This is a bloodbath. Alright, I���m calling this.
Eighty-nine.
Ohh.
Just three single guys. Getting into trouble.
Michael, we are only allowed to talk about Meredith's work performance. We can not ask her to stop drinking.
The Scranton strangler. George Howard Skub. Haven't I told you about the jury I was on a couple years ago?
I only have $200.
Okay.
Andy, we wanted to talk to you. A lot of us are very concerned about you.
What are you talking about?
What?
We can play something more complicated if you like.
Uh... what was your favorite flavor of...
That may have been my fault.
Oh my god.
[to Jan] He talked the whole time.
Damn it.
Michael Scott, this is Holly.
Andy, it's not the original. And destroying it will not stop them from dating. Andy. [Andy throws paper at him and leaves, Toby straightens paper out] It's the original.
Well, that'll work.
I like to think Lloyd Gross is a no-nonsense guy who doesn���t back down from anybody. And he calls people ���Kimosabe���.
Wow.
All right Michael, but Oscar's really gay.
Uh... it... compliment...
Anyone can follow a Twitter feed. Wanna share a cab?
I already signed it. I was just showing you.
[opening kite from Ryan] Wow! Cause... [reveals Kite Runner book]
Sorry. Hey, Toby Flenderson. Nice to meet you. How can I help?
Oh my God!
Kevin.  His gambling problem must've resurfaced. I'm gonna have to send him home until I can do an investigation.
Hey, uh... where'd you decide to take Karen tonight?
Honestly, I don't even hear her anymore. It's like waves crashing against the beach.
Well, Kelly's been so upset about Ryan dumping her, that she can't even talk. [grins]
Yeah. I have my dignity too. I refuse to be another man's horsey.
No, they're clean.  I was going to wear them to volleyball practice later.
I'm hungry.
Oh... yes.
I don't know.
Oh, when you sign your job application you agree to comply with random drug testing.
Yes.
Maybe you could just take the rest of the day off... you know...
As part of my last day I'm training the new Human Resources rep in the ways of the company. Again, the company has allotted for this training-one day.
Me?
Mmm-Hm.
I will send this off to corporate.  Make sure you hold on to your medical bills.  Feel better.
Cause Ryan asked me to talk to you.
[unintelligible mumbling]
[laughs out loud] Excuse me.
Okay, I���m at what���s called ���the decision point.���
How would we get home?
I don't know.
Thanks!
Michael?
I don't think Michael intended to punish me, by putting Ryan back here with Kelly.  But, if he did intend that?  Wow.  Genius.
Good.
Hey Kev.
Are you serious?
[sighs and pulls out a box under his desk] It's all Dwight's.
Hi.
I work here.
Tough? I put an innocent man on death row.
No, no, no, no, no. Women chase him. He misses his wife.
Just preparing for the deposition.
Well, you need a wife first, or at least a girlfriend.
Which is where?
But now it's being looked at as more of a productivity issue.
Michael.
I'm just trying to help you Michael.
You wanted to see the gooey eye.
Andy?
The more the merrier.
No, I mean he's attracted to other men.
No, no. Andy.
[hugging Nellie] So proud of you, Hon.
Come on, Dwight. Get out of here.
Okay, this isn���t over. Let���s stay focused, okay? ��We made fun of Andy earlier for getting beat up by a little girl, but... little things can be dangerous.
I don't know how I'm going to get through this. I don't want to lie and I DON'T want to tell the truth.
Yeah. No, it's uncanny.
I have very fertile hair glands.
Yeah. So anyway, the entire jury wants me to vote guilty. But then I did a little research of my own, and forget everything you thought you knew about fingerprinting.
Casual Fridays are cancelled.  [everyone protests]  Let's just not do it anymore.
You���re really there to talk to each other. I would say that the therapist is more of a facilitator.
You'll see.
My birthday was two months ago.
Hookah is not an illegal drug, Michael.
Who brought in donuts?
Michael, nine different people emailed me that photo, including my ex-wife... we don't talk now.
Michael is like a movie on a plane.  You know, it's not great, but it's something to watch.  And when it's over you're like... how much time is left on this flight? Now what?
See?
I... guess I forgot.
This is fun. You know? I mean, this is fun.
Actually, she's right. This isn't appropriate. Why don't I take these.
I can neither confirm nor deny this. Let's just say I'll be up to my neck in jury duty. [excited outbursts]
���..Chad Flendermen's kryptonite. [Darryl walks up to Toby and Val in a tuxedo]
Michael, I'm sorry...
Mmhmm.
Michael, I have one extra twin bed, if you want.
Please sit down.
If we don't patronise the only Syrian restaurant in town, there'll be nothing left but pan pizzas and make-your-own salads.
Oh, you guys. Kelly called it. 2013. So s���hey! Hey! Hey, no! No! Get outta here. Clark, get outta here.
Wow Michael, like this must be obvious how wrong this is.
Well the 'fun' is in it. [conference room group chimes agreement.]
Michael, look.  I know this is hard for you, but death's just a part of life.  I mean, just this morning I saw a little bird fly into the glass doors downstairs and die.  And I had to keep going.
Hi, do you mind if I sign the card real quick?
Hello! [laughing] Hello!
That is not mine.  I have never seen that before.
Technically, I am in Human Resources. And Dwight was asking about human anatomy. Um... I'm just sad the public school system failed him so badly.
Well, I don't think there's any reason to check 'em but I suppose if we wanted to be really certain...
Wow, I'd love to take a look at that.
Yeah, I guess it will be my, uh, thing in Costa Rica, be a nature photographer.
[tossing forms at Michael] Just fill them out any way you want.
Um... You might want these orientation materials.
Ow! Ow!
It's so random that I have it.
Well I just wanted to say I'm doing it. [Toby leaves]
Wow, you just dive right into it.
Um, yeah, ah, ah, that means a lot.  Thank you for saying it.
These things just have a way of working themselves out.
You know who's not gonna get to work on some exciting new startup this year? George Howard Skub, a.k.a. the alleged Scranton strangler, because he's in prison [Jim and Daryl walk out of the kitchen] for something he may not have done.
Every Halloween I tell him the same thing - You can't bring weapons into the office, and every year he says the same thing - As soon as I get my weapons back I'm gonna kill you. But there I am at Thanksgiving, alive, you know. I'm a lucky turkey.
Let���s do it. Let���s get personal.
Corporate will be sending someone else to take my place for a while.
I'm good...
Ernesto!
It's the empanada guy.
Well, and you have a... yes, a- d- another chateau.
Nice.
Shortly after Kelly left, Ryan quit and also moved to Ohio, for what he claimed were unrelated reasons.
Yeah, I assumed Michael was already doing this.  That's why I only use my personal e-mail account.
He said that?
Oh, wow, this is, uh, just a mystery novel that I've been working on.
Uh, you know what, I can go park it myself.
[walks in] Hey, Jim.
I like it just us three.  [very quietly] I don't want it to change.
Somehow.
Is everything okay?
This is the prison. Uh, I am not going in there with expectations, per say. Uh, I will meet George Howard Scubb. I will tell him that I believe he is innocent. I would understand if he felt motivated to hug me. I would understand if a friendship began. How did, how did Bogart put it? [imitating Humphrey Bogart] I think this is a start of my first friendship.
Ok, I can't count the hour if you don't talk.
I don't know. No.
I-- I don���t know if there���s truth to-- to, uh, to that.
No, no,... no. Sorry. We cut Kevin off for the same thing. You have to have something to say, if you talk. [Angela rolls her eyes and stops talking]
I can���t.
Two dimes, seven nickels--Well, okay, no, that doesn't add up. It was one quarter and--
Oh. [laughs nervously]
That... [shakes head and places hand over the file]
I don't report to you, Michael. I report to the head of HR in New York.
It's just a little dispute over a poster in their workspace.
There's not a single appropriate outfit in this whole--except mine, quite honestly.
Absolutely. [Toby kisses Amy for an extended period of time, Pam and Jim are shocked]
I guess I shouldn't have stopped for dinner.
Concentrating? Is anyone having trouble getting their work done today?
This is Jim Halpert...
[after awkward pause] Sh, uh, um, I was having this separate conversation with Kevin. Uh, Johnny Depp.
Good morning.
I could loan you a pair of socks.
No it's not. It's a type of pipe. You can fill it with tobacco, often mixed with fruit, or other flavors.
I don't wanna do this.
It's just a snack.
Ok, you know, Michael...
Generally happy. [clip montage]
For you?
Really, really funny.
Great.  Because you that I think the very fact that [Michael mutes the call]
I am on the wrong side, and I am freaking out here.
Michael...
Aren't the suggestions meant for you?
Oww.
50?
I���m just curious though, what do you have against Pete and Erin?
Blah blah blah blah. Jim.
I'm sorry.
That is unbelievable.
Uhh, oh boy, oh boy.
All right, thanks Michael.
Well, I was in the Seminary for a year and dropped out 'cause I wanted to have sex with this girl, Cathy.  Followed her to Scranton.  Took the first job I could find in H.R.  Later she divorced me.  So no, I wouldn't say I have a passion for H.R.
Hey Dwight. Pretty nice robe- [Dwight grabs bag with robe in it and walks away.] Why?
Any word on those time cards?
You're into trains?
Say Anything, The Shining, Annie Hall, that's too obvious.
You know I don't have to do the paperwork unless you're actually dating.
Hmmm.
It���s interesting that you���re drawn to the point of view of the attacker. ��You would like the turn of the table. Okay, the latest Chad Flenderman novel... [everyone groans] written from the point of view of his nemesis, Dr. Lucifer Wu.
Michael, I'm your HR Rep. I'm on your side.
Yes.
Ah, pretty good. I finished.
Do you see David Wallace in the room right now?
About you and Jan.
Hi, nice to meet you.
I can't talk about it or I'll get removed from the jury.
Chad Flendermen. Just an easy going black guy, he knows the streets, yet he also went to Oxford. So. Just as comfortable on a motorcycle as he is on Air Force One. Oh and he's also the world's leading Egyptologist.
It's like if you write someone a letter, when you're really angry... they say to keep it in a drawer for a couple days. Then you just never end up sending it.
Mmm-hmm.
No.
[leans hobo sack against the refrigerator] It's a great stick, right?
Okay.
There was no party.
Oh, hey, Bert. Wanna see the dance? Dem bones, dem bones, dem dry...
You remember that.
on our policy.
Uh, great.  Why don't we move on?
Hey guys.  This is my, uh, girlfriend, Amy.
Hey, did you go to Bishop Ohara?
Heh.
I think it's better that I...
Unless part of you made that mistake on purpose.
No, uh... [shouts] Does anyone have a camera here? [no one answers him] No one has a camera here. Uh...
Anybody need sun block? Got SPF 30.
Good luck Gabe.
I'm sorry.
Pam, can I talk to you for a second?
So this is H.R. This is your desk.
Michael, do you have the name of the employee you're letting go? I'd like to start working on out-placement.
Michael has been assigned six hours of mandatory counseling with a trained professional. I actually have a degree in social work. I mean, I know a lot of people would ask a few standard questions, and check off a few boxes, but I've got a chance to do some good here.
Uh... wow....
Yeah. Um, you mind if I get a picture?
Well I guess this weddings not going to happen.  I wonder if this is it for them.  [Jim and Pam walk in laughing]
[to Sasha] Come on.
Would you consider this a terrorist incident?
That was... I went to Costa Rica for a few months.  What is going on?
Have a great day!
...and you bounce it off the wall on your side of the tape.
Uh, Holly Flax, she comes from the Nashua branch.
[gesturing to the rest of the office] This is everybody else... okay... This is the place... so thanks for the lift.
Yeah.
...and, yeah, the whole thing was incredibly cathartic.
Bye.
Jan told me just a few minutes before she told you.
Michael, it's almost 5:00.
So you set him up.
Well, you know how everyone fast forwards through ads these days? Well, what about an ad in slow motion. You know, if they fast forward through it, it'll just seem normal and it will catch your eye. Plus, uh, the slogan could be: Dunder Mifflin, we adapt to the pace of your business. [murmurs of approval by everyone but Michael]
Hey I left my glasses down here somewhere. Crossing through, beep beep. [Pam's plane hit Toby in the eye]
If you turn out the lights we'll do a little dance.
I have a reasonable right to privacy.
Well, that's...
You know they're teasing you. I mean... obviously, this is... a much nicer place than an actual prison. We get paid to be here. We go home afterwards and have social lives. We have... we have parties here. They're teasing you. To be funny.
Thanks Dwight.
I-I think we hang out an appropriate amount of time.
We can do this with more privacy.
I didn't put caprese salad in my drawer, Michael.
Your outfit.
If they were dilated...
Michael, We should contact some experts.  You don't know what your doing.
Yeah, okay. Corporate would like us to do a five minute review of the Company Sexual Harassment policy so I'll go over that later.
Yes.
What are, are you doing at my desk?
[to Sasha] Okay, tell them what you wanted to say.
Miami University in Ohio. On her last day, Kelly was still a little confused about it
All right, well, let���s try one simple technique together. Okay, why doesn���t everyone stand? Okay, so... you���re being attacked. You���ve got your hands up. Simple palm strike to the chin. Up to the chin. One, two.
Oh.
No, nah.  I don't see it.
Okay, look, in a real crisis situation, you���re not gonna have to time to think, okay? So just remember, I-A-A-T-G. ���It���s all about the groin.���
Course you do.
It's an EMF hotspot.
Thanks Kelly.
[laughing] Happy's a funny word.
Hey.
Well, good.  We can, uh, throw that one out. [shuffles through papers]
That's it? Yeah, well, ok. Thanks Darryl.
So, her husband, your stepdad?
I���ve seen guys like you. Big guys who like to push the little guys around. Lloyd Gross eats bullies like you for breakfast.
Ryan invited me to go on his wilderness adventure retreat. It was this amazing, beautiful experience [Michael knocks on the window behind Toby from outside]
Technically, he's right.
What?
Except you just told me you were gonna make it up. Now if she sues, I have to testify against you.
Hey Nellie. Mmm. I am so sick of February. It's the shortest month but it sure doesn't feel that way. We should catch up.
I mean, what���s the end date? It must be really hard for her to sign on to be unhappy if she doesn���t know when it���s gonna end.
It's a dead animal in an office. You can't...
I'm sorry?
There were two or three 'sorry's in there. [mumbles along with Nellie]
Well, look, sometimes things crop up later. So, uhh, you should know I'm always available if anyone would like to talk.
Fun?
Now, if your attacker is willing to defile a corpse, you better stop playing dead right away and just make it known that you���re alive.
Michael?
Not much? What's up with you? [from bathroom above] Nah it's okay. I'm in the bathroom. Hey you been watching Damages this year? It's so good. No, you gotta tune in, it's as good as anything on HBO. [sound of pissing] Hey does blue go with tan?
How will your experience selling refinery equipment translate to our smaller scale here?
Oh thanks.  She's gonna... [notices the doll is black] oh...
It was actually kind of hard to meet people I found.
I always thought he might have been set up but I felt pressured to convict.
OK, I am telling you, Oscar is an actual homosexual.  Yeah, he told me this morning.  And, obviously he hopes he can count on your discretion.
Okay.  And-- the-the power-- comes from the back foot.  So its-- its all one motion through the-- body.  So you stay a little low and there's a twist.  You keep your shoulder down and you kind of throw out the arm.  [demonstrates punch] Pow!
He seems fine to me.
No, I'm sorry, it's...
It's a finicky car...
He didn't seem like he was joking.
Hey you wanted to see me?
Self-defense is not some fun boxing match, okay? This is about escaping with your life. So... strike, scream, and run. All right? Let���s try it.
I mean for real.
Alright everyone, look, it, alright my complaint was about Jim and Pam. So...
I'd say all the goofing around at Pam's desk, and, and hanging out with Pam, has finally caught up to him... w-with Pam
Yeah.
You can only fire Nellie for cause.
Fine. Good.
You know, for your own protection, you should disclose the relationship to HR.
I got Angela. She is into these posters of babies dressed as adults. I got her one of those. I felt kind of weird buying that.
Oh, uh, I don't know, uh...
Ok, look the memo is not about you...
You mean food truck. Ernesto's was a food truck.
Hey... [sees both Jim and Pam] you two.
If you really want to have kids, I--- I guess you could somehow... foster parent, or something.
What's something that you...
Well, that was better.
Believe me, she has enough toys... she doesn't need your watch.
I just though you could add me.  I don't see the harm in that.
[knocks] Hey Jim.
You can't, [Michael touches his forehead and makes sizzling noise] Ow. Look, you cannot push religion.
This is a picture I've been carrying around in my wallet for about six years.  It's this unspoiled beach in Costa Rica, Playa Grande.  Um, I take it out when I get stressed or depressed, and it really calms me down.  Never thought I'd get to live here, you know.  But it turns out they built these great new condos there, so, this could be me, right around, uh, where the trees used to be.
[entering Andy's office] Knock, knock. Hey, Sasha's first year in the troops, so I'm selling cookies for her. Anyway, would you like some?
I know, um, but Ryan thinks that, uh, they're not good enough.
You filled them in and faxed them yourself!
Hey, I just got the word on the communal birthdays. Great idea.
You have to stop. [bangs on glass window]
Hey.
And then Corporate is going to send in a lawyer...
[crying] I'm sorry!
I guess everything's okay.
All right, if you're having a relationship with your superior, you must disclose it.
I'm not processing this.
Nothing.
Talk to Michael. I gave him the box.
There's a bunch of people back here, maybe...
Toy Story 2, one of the best movies I ever saw. I went for my daughter and stayed because you can't leave your daughter in a theater.
[halfway out] Yeah, I know.
OK I think Oscar would just like if you used 'lame' or something like that.
You know, why don't we split the order? It's only fair.
Did you guys do much stuff together?
Did you bring your passport with you?
Are... are you me?
Thanks man! [awkwardly tries to hug Ryan, pats him on the back]
Here's how I usually handle this: all I do is listen.
Hey, really nice job in that meeting in there.
I don't think the women in this office -
No.
Yeah, me too.
[singing and dancing] Dem bones, dem bones, dem tired bones, now we're the skeleton crew.
I don���t know if this is gonna help...Uh...
Yeah, I could say something.
Um, yeah.  You're computer screen can be a big strain on your eyes, so uh, it's also recommended that you step away for about... about ten minutes every hour.
You can't fire Pete. You understand why, right?
OK, Michael, are you aware that you ousted Oscar today?
This here is a radon test kit. [holding out tiny cylinder disc] Okay I will be putting 'em everywhere. And... please don't throw these out. [starts snapping towards Michael's face] This is a radon test kit. [continues snapping] Please don't throw these out. [Michael gives annoyed look] See them all over the office.
Hi! [goes to hug Nellie]
Um... I need to talk to you in your office. It'll just take two seconds.
Yes.
[on video cam with his brother] Here's the thing Rory, I knew you guys would hit it off in an odd way.
Who's Jeff?
...bones. What?
Just to refresh you... .
I know, Michael.
Oh.
Hey, what's going on? There's a police car in the...
Radiant.
[on the computer] No, but I'm going zip lining tomorrow, through the, through the rainforest, with this cool couple I, I met at my hotel.  Wo-woman's amazing...
[fending Andy off] Oh, come on. Andy, no.
[takes duck back] Yes.
Tell me!
Yeah, Michael asked about it once. I just pretended not to hear him. He left.
...then she should be allowed to.
Uh... it's true...
But there aren't...
[to Darryl] Hey, you tricked me. You just wanted Kevin.
Well, we fired Roy, obviously.  And Jim won't press charges against Roy or the company.
Hi, Micha-
A little ironic that I'm going to be kind of a TV star, because my last Chad Flendermen novel [groups groans] was based on a murdered TV star. The small screen-
It's really not a big deal, Michael.
Under the stars. It was really beautiful, you should come.
Yeah.
Toby! Yeah!
What do you mean?
You know, uh, what does it mean to be happy. [shakes head] Keep philosophers busy for awhile.
At the gym.
Yeah, sure, what's up?
It's working. I'm doing it!
Me?
To your HR representative.
Well, as you know, Ed Truck passed away. So, I'm here to talk about it if anyone would like to.
Ok, I mean, I could talk to her.
It's probably okay...
I don���t think that���s very common.
Yes, uh some people in the office have complained...
[alone in cab} After Dwight fired me, I moved to New York to write the great American novel. I have six roommates. Heh. Which are better than friends, you know ���cause they have to give you one month���s notice before they leave.
And I am Bacchus's friend!
Hi, I'm uh, Toby Flenderson. I'm here to see George Howard Scubb.
You know, when I was on j-duty, uh, Strangler case, we used to recreate the various stranglings with empanadas from- at Ernesto's.
When I put it in I thought it would be a waste of time, but I guess it was worth it.
Well, uh, okay. Um.  It's really great to be here tonight, with the Ferris wheel, the band, and the low sunlight.  I'm gonna miss you all when I go to Costa Rica, and if I keep drinking beer like this, I'm gonna have to take a leak-a. [laughter from audience, Michael looks at camera unhappily]  Look, on a more personal note, I just want to say thanks, you know, no matter what was going on in my life, you know, my divorce, or the custody battle, or that thing with my sister, it was just nice knowing I had a, a supportive place to come to where...
[chuckles, snorts]
Oh, Michael, you can't ask about religious beliefs...
Really? She's dating?
Can't you just not look at his feet?
Hey, Pam.
[in feminine voice] And this is Sam.
How are you? Hey. Welcome back. [puts out fist to bump]
So... okay.
You're-you're not in it.
So Dwight and Darryl came to an agreement that both would file complaints with corporate and now I get to do all this paperwork.  We worked it out.
[excitedly] Oh, I should get the accident report binder. I've never used the gun violence forms before.
Yeah.
I really didn't think I was going to have a good time, but I did. Totally did.
So remember, intent is irrelevant. And that's it. Pam?
Uh, I just wanted to let you know that, uh, I'll be taking a leave of absence starting next week.
[mimes lifting a glass] To Amsterdam.
You don't need to write 'ex'.
Note? It's a symphony.
Where?
I have like, like a blue shirt? I don't wear a lot of colors, I have a lot of tan. Uh huh.
Don't make me be your pony, Kevin.
I think we might be about to maybe really get somewhere.
I- I said I'm Tony. Okay I made a mistake. I thought it might go unnoticed. But uh, I'm Toby.
Really? Today?
Michael wasn't invited.
I might have it in here.
Oh my goodness, look. Look at this.
No, you hit the road, jack.
Well, you're going to have to let 'em out. Or... or I will.
[looks resigned]
Pete���s a pretty cool guy, though, and Andy was a terrible lover to Erin. He basically ignored her and left on a boat.
He- he can't do that.  Turns out she's allowed to have feelings of sexual arousal.  It doesn't become a violation until she physically acts on it.
Hey.
Oh well, you know, those were only for, you know [makes quotes with fingers] relationships, so... if, if this is just a casual thing, there's no need, really.
You know, anything that warms you.
No, no, no. It's not fair. What if Kevin wants to buy cookies from me?
No.
You can't claim territories. This is the only place I interact with people. Can't you sell at your church or barber shop? [Darryl looks hurt] Or chess club, or?
Robert did say you'd be joining us. Welcome. I'm Tony.
Alright.
[stands outside church entrance] Okay, this is, all right, this is silly. [goes inside] [walks back out] Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope...
Hey Darryl, look ahhh, we're here to apologize ahh...
Come on Dwight. We went over this, like for a half an hour.
You know but the police could have been out there you know, catching real criminals instead of here searching my stuff.
Hey, where do I park?
Oscar says I checked out huh?  Huh. [nods head]
Hey.
No, I did not violate an Indian burial ground. In fact I had some good luck recently, Alfredo's Pizza, picked my business card out of the basket, so... uh, I got a week of free pies.
It's a little tricky, you might have to... take... [Mose speeds away]
I don���t... I don���t...
I was at a parent-teacher conference.
