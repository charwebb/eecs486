This is the prison. Uh, I am not going in there with expectations, per say. Uh, I will meet George Howard Scubb. I will tell him that I believe he is innocent. I would understand if he felt motivated to hug me. I would understand if a friendship began. How did, how did Bogart put it? [imitating Humphrey Bogart] I think this is a start of my first friendship.
Uh, I just wanted to let you know that, uh, I'll be taking a leave of absence starting next week.
Not much? What's up with you? [from bathroom above] Nah it's okay. I'm in the bathroom. Hey you been watching Damages this year? It's so good. No, you gotta tune in, it's as good as anything on HBO. [sound of pissing] Hey does blue go with tan?
I am so glad I got all of the dudes to do Movember. We have the dopest time back in the annex.
Ryan invited me to go on his wilderness adventure retreat. It was this amazing, beautiful experience [Michael knocks on the window behind Toby from outside]
Alright everyone, look, it, alright my complaint was about Jim and Pam. So...
Oh, no, no. no. My plane just got in. From New York. Are you still with Piotr?
You filled them in and faxed them yourself!
Hi, Kevin. Look, I need to talk to you about-
It���s interesting that you���re drawn to the point of view of the attacker. ��You would like the turn of the table. Okay, the latest Chad Flenderman novel... [everyone groans] written from the point of view of his nemesis, Dr. Lucifer Wu.
Two dimes, seven nickels--Well, okay, no, that doesn't add up. It was one quarter and--
No, no,... no. Sorry. We cut Kevin off for the same thing. You have to have something to say, if you talk. [Angela rolls her eyes and stops talking]
That was the right decision for me and my marriage.
I'm gonna really miss going to beers with you guys every Tuesday night [Pam holds up soda in salute, Meredith yells 'yeah!', Michael looks at camera] and lastly, I'd love to urge you to keep up with my fight to have the building checked for radon gas.  You know, it's a, it's a real serious matter, and every time I try to have the, uh...
I'm just saying I don't think it's appropriate for you to have given Ryan that award.
We should really have the office's air quality tested. We have radon coming from below, we have asbestos in the ceilings. These are silent killers.
There's not a single appropriate outfit in this whole--except mine, quite honestly.
I can refer you to someone to talk to.
Great.  Because you that I think the very fact that [Michael mutes the call]
Um... in fact, basic rule of thumb, let's just act everyday like Pam's Mom's coming in. All right. That's it. Um... if anybody has any questions about anything, you know where I sit in the back.
Concentrating? Is anyone having trouble getting their work done today?
[whispering] I am not doing your dirty work for you.
Oh, this looks great. I'd, I'd love to be there, but my daughter's play is tonight. ... Damnit! You know, one of the other parents will probably videotape it.
I like to think Lloyd Gross is a no-nonsense guy who doesn���t back down from anybody. And he calls people ���Kimosabe���.
Alright... Well, um, if you really believe that Stanley was joking...
I don't know, I just thought you could include me.
I don't think laughing about it is an appropriate response.
But I-- I promised my daughter. Darryl, look-- I-- I need the doll, I need the doll.  I-- I'm-- I'm begging you.  I just-- I need it more than anything in this world.  I need this doll. Darryl, man I need this doll.
You have to stop. [bangs on glass window]
[fending Andy off] Oh, come on. Andy, no.
I would spend a lot of time launching my true crime podcast, The Flenderson Files. Dum bum buh. [whispers] Flenderson files.
[sighing] Look, it's a free country. If she wants to throw a party...
You know who's not gonna get to work on some exciting new startup this year? George Howard Skub, a.k.a. the alleged Scranton strangler, because he's in prison [Jim and Daryl walk out of the kitchen] for something he may not have done.
Hi, do you mind if I sign the card real quick?
Absolutely. [Toby kisses Amy for an extended period of time, Pam and Jim are shocked]
I don't... I don't think we can do that.
Uh, we're on recess. I came for the party. Hey, everyone.
[sighs and pulls out a box under his desk] It's all Dwight's.
Yes, it is your mistake. He���s lingering. So annoying. I���m gonna kill him. How can I help? I���m here.
[hands Meredith his camera] This one right here.
Yeah, er... pull up a chair or sit on the shredder.
Corporate will be sending someone else to take my place for a while.
A guy on my street fell off a ladder painting his house.  It was on the news.
I knew it. I knew it from the beginning it was possible.
The lady cop acted like she'd never pulled someone over for driving too slow.  And I tried to get out of it with the famous Toby Flenderson 10,000 watt smile. [smiles] It didn't work.
[unwraps present; present is a rock with a Post-It note rubber-banded to it; reads] 'Suck on this.'
Erin, HR is a joke. I can't do anything about anything.
No, no.  Um, you always want to keep a sweater or cardigan of some sort, in case it gets drafty.
Miami University in Ohio. On her last day, Kelly was still a little confused about it
Yeah, okay. Corporate would like us to do a five minute review of the Company Sexual Harassment policy so I'll go over that later.
Well, we did a little investigation and Dwight had a good point.  The ladder didn't reach the top shelf.  I don't know if I believe it, but I am a fan of the hardboiled detective novel.  [impression] I'll punch you in da mush, see.
You know, Michael, sometimes my daughter's stomach hurts when there's a mean girl at school...
Wow Michael, like this must be obvious how wrong this is.
Um, yeah, ah, ah, that means a lot.  Thank you for saying it.
I don't think the women in this office -
As part of my last day I'm training the new Human Resources rep in the ways of the company. Again, the company has allotted for this training-one day.
Can���t. I took a course at the Weintraub Memory Academy. I sat next to this woman named Beverly Brook. She had a Greek salad for lunch. See what I mean?
...feel like I may have glossed over a few...
I made it this far, right? What's the point?
Now, if your attacker is willing to defile a corpse, you better stop playing dead right away and just make it known that you���re alive.
Hey, we're not all going to sit in a circle Indian style are we? [Laughing]
I really didn't think I was going to have a good time, but I did. Totally did.
It is enough of this. Everyone, let���s go back to work.
Yes, that's true. I have never won a Dundie. I am more than okay  with that.
Well I guess this weddings not going to happen.  I wonder if this is it for them.  [Jim and Pam walk in laughing]
All right, well, let���s try one simple technique together. Okay, why doesn���t everyone stand? Okay, so... you���re being attacked. You���ve got your hands up. Simple palm strike to the chin. Up to the chin. One, two.
OK, Michael, are you aware that you ousted Oscar today?
Yes, uh some people in the office have complained...
Michael has been assigned six hours of mandatory counseling with a trained professional. I actually have a degree in social work. I mean, I know a lot of people would ask a few standard questions, and check off a few boxes, but I've got a chance to do some good here.
Andy, we wanted to talk to you. A lot of us are very concerned about you.
Well, the most common scenario is a larger man attacking a smaller female.
Look, you know, in any company  there's going to be certain degrees -
Well, I was hoping that maybe in light of everything that's happened today, it would be a good idea if today, you, me, and Michael could head into the conference room for some conflict resolution.
Let's just wait and see what happens. [whispers] You know?
Michael, it's up to me to check off the boxes, and I can't do that unless I honestly...
Yeah, the ball-throwing exercise is in the binder. It's in the section marked, 'Fun Ways To Make Brainstorming Sessions Explode With Excitement and Creativity.'
Now, we���re actually a lot closer to Binghamton than you are. Kimosabe.
Hey, what's going on?  You don't have my permission to do this.
I'm sorry, if we did something to upset you, I'm sure it was inadvertent.
If you really want to have kids, I--- I guess you could somehow... foster parent, or something.
Oscar says I checked out huh?  Huh. [nods head]
Oh, sure, lots of times. Yeah. Wait, you and Pam aren���t in couple���s counseling, are you? Oh, God.
Ah, you should probably deal with that outside of the work place.
Michael, do you have the name of the employee you're letting go? I'd like to start working on out-placement.
OK, I am telling you, Oscar is an actual homosexual.  Yeah, he told me this morning.  And, obviously he hopes he can count on your discretion.
Uh, no, the opposite. I was actually selected to be a juror on a very high-profile case.
It's just a little dispute over a poster in their workspace.
Yeah, maybe when you get really comfortable with each other, you can ask for that.
Michael, nine different people emailed me that photo, including my ex-wife... we don't talk now.
[to Kevin] Honestly, is there any way you can get on your fiancee's plan? Our health plan is s... just... it's terrible.
I really disagree with this. I think it's kind of hateful. Though I am a little happy right now to have a platform to talk about the outcome of a case I was recently a juror on. The Scranton Strangler. That man's being put to death. I was part of the verdict, and I'm not so sure he's guilty any more. [Dwight plays a clip from the song Oh Yeah: Ohhhh yeah! Chica chicaaa]
But I mean���uh have you talked to her? Is sh���
That really hurt. I'm writing you up. [Angela makes an angry face] Hey, you are not allowed to touch other employees. Am I being clear?
...about some other people engaging in PDA and, you know [Michael leans in closer to Toby] I just wanted to remind it's not appropriate to, to do that.
Alright, well look. While I have you here, this is a relationship disclosure form for Pete & Erin.
[answering phone] This is Toby. Hey Pam. Where are you calling from?
Well, you're going to have to let 'em out. Or... or I will.
Ok, um, one thing that you're gonna want to look out for is carpal tunnel syndrome.  It's recommended that you take a ten minute break from typing every hour.  For your circulation, you're gonna want to get up out of your chairs and uh, and move around about ten minutes every hour.
Oh, Michael, you can't ask about religious beliefs...
Hey, text from the old wife. Gonna take that. [runs outside]
This is a picture I've been carrying around in my wallet for about six years.  It's this unspoiled beach in Costa Rica, Playa Grande.  Um, I take it out when I get stressed or depressed, and it really calms me down.  Never thought I'd get to live here, you know.  But it turns out they built these great new condos there, so, this could be me, right around, uh, where the trees used to be.
I spent three years in advertising before I came here.
Well, we still have to do the exit interview.
Well you know Michael, I have a brother in Boulder. Rory Flenderson. You should look him up.
I didn't put caprese salad in my drawer, Michael.
Ah, this reminds me of the HR convention last fall.
It's just boiler plating, you don't have to read it.
I heard about the hit.  Just-- make sure it's off company property, right?
[walks up to Pam's desk with a binder] Hey Pam, could I talk to you for a sec?
Yeah, I guess it will be my, uh, thing in Costa Rica, be a nature photographer.
Michael, I'm your HR Rep. I'm on your side.
Its really sad that your dog ran away. Why did it keep you from going to the park?
Actually, I have a separate folder for complaints against Michael. This [unlocks a drawer]is January through March of this year. [pulls out a fairly large folder]
It is real, thank you for saying that.
I am on the wrong side, and I am freaking out here.
Yeah. Um, you mind if I get a picture?
He- he can't do that.  Turns out she's allowed to have feelings of sexual arousal.  It doesn't become a violation until she physically acts on it.
I have like, like a blue shirt? I don't wear a lot of colors, I have a lot of tan. Uh huh.
[standing behind Erin] I don't think this fax is going through. Is there a different... I can just put it through again, you know.
It's not.  It's not.  Sit down or I am writing you up.
Michael, uh... we shouldn't be talking about this until all the decisions have been made.
Come on Michael. Those are all fake stories.
You know, when I was on j-duty, uh, Strangler case, we used to recreate the various stranglings with empanadas from- at Ernesto's.
Guys, I think Michael and Luke are related.
We even go to lunch, pick up babes.
You know I don't have to do the paperwork unless you're actually dating.
Say Anything, The Shining, Annie Hall, that's too obvious.
I���ve seen guys like you. Big guys who like to push the little guys around. Lloyd Gross eats bullies like you for breakfast.
Kevin.  His gambling problem must've resurfaced. I'm gonna have to send him home until I can do an investigation.
I'm gonna... I'll go get one. Stay. [runs out of the office]
You know but the police could have been out there you know, catching real criminals instead of here searching my stuff.
[opening kite from Ryan] Wow! Cause... [reveals Kite Runner book]
You think I have a machine for measuring bee hives?
Well, I really can't talk about it, but it's a very high profile case.
Okay, I���m at what���s called ���the decision point.���
Kelly Kapoor is gone. Her fianc�� Ravi was hired as a pediatrics professor at Miami university.
Does it have to be pizza? Could go for a, falafel?
Oh, wow, this is, uh, just a mystery novel that I've been working on.
I think these belong to you. [puts toys down on desk]
Oh thanks.  She's gonna... [notices the doll is black] oh...
You know, for your own protection, you should disclose the relationship to HR.
Well I just wanted to say I'm doing it. [Toby leaves]
I-- I don���t know if there���s truth to-- to, uh, to that.
Uh, about a week. Er... .um... .maybe a month. I uh can't...
Okay, you get a one-second hold on the ball...
There's a bunch of people back here, maybe...
Yeah, I don't know why you picked names that are also guys' names.
It���s going to be nice to have just a healthy, young, fit presence in the middle of the office.
Hey. Hey, you know, I just realized uh, I don't have a picture of the two of us.
Can't you just not look at his feet?
I mean, what���s the end date? It must be really hard for her to sign on to be unhappy if she doesn���t know when it���s gonna end.
She's going to be screaming her own last name?
It's like if you write someone a letter, when you're really angry... they say to keep it in a drawer for a couple days. Then you just never end up sending it.
I���m just curious though, what do you have against Pete and Erin?
That... [shakes head and places hand over the file]
The Scranton strangler. George Howard Skub. Haven't I told you about the jury I was on a couple years ago?
More like 'Everyone let's get your boss laid Saturday.' [more laughs] [Toby puts his hand on Pam's knee, everyone stares, Toby removes his hand] I have an announcement uh, to make. I am moving to Costa Rica. Thought about it for a long time now. And I'm finally gonna do it. So, I'm just gonna hop the fence and jog home now. [runs out of lobby and climbs the fence and jogs away]
[to Sasha] Okay, tell them what you wanted to say.
Unless part of you made that mistake on purpose.
Michael, can I talk to you for a uh, second please?
It's out of context.  It's not the same as driving.
No, they're clean.  I was going to wear them to volleyball practice later.
OK I think Oscar would just like if you used 'lame' or something like that.
Michael is like a movie on a plane.  You know, it's not great, but it's something to watch.  And when it's over you're like... how much time is left on this flight? Now what?
I don't really play cards, but I'm not gonna lie to you. It felt really good to take money from Michael. Gonna chase that feeling.
And then Corporate is going to send in a lawyer...
You know, sometimes I wish we just didn't have a conference room. [Kelly laughs] You know? He couldn't do that.
Ok, look the memo is not about you...
Yeah, I'm really looking forward to working with you, Michael.
Fine, I'll take your name off. [looks at Michael] So no one will know.
It's a dead animal in an office. You can't...
[on phone] Hey Sasha, it's daddy.  Have you ever heard of this doll , Princess Unicorn?
Except you just told me you were gonna make it up. Now if she sues, I have to testify against you.
You gonna eat all that dog food yourself?
Hi, I'm uh, Toby Flenderson. I'm here to see George Howard Scubb.
Oh well, you know, those were only for, you know [makes quotes with fingers] relationships, so... if, if this is just a casual thing, there's no need, really.
[tossing forms at Michael] Just fill them out any way you want.
I prefer being stuck in a Costa Rican hospital.
I don���t know if this is gonna help...Uh...
Self-defense is not some fun boxing match, okay? This is about escaping with your life. So... strike, scream, and run. All right? Let���s try it.
Well, we could try him out for a little while... [Jim drops his pen, looks exasperated] and if it doesn't work out, you know, maybe one of us could, you know, step in...
[Warehouse Worker Frank remains silent, picks ear] You sort of deserve an apology here. Frank?
Well the 'fun' is in it. [conference room group chimes agreement.]
Okay, this isn���t over. Let���s stay focused, okay? ��We made fun of Andy earlier for getting beat up by a little girl, but... little things can be dangerous.
I wouldn't want to do that now would I?
[Creed takes a bite of an apple] Creed is eating an apple.  I found a potato.
Yeah, um... I can���t believe you remembered. I do self-defense. Um, I���ll go put on my cup.
You know they're teasing you. I mean... obviously, this is... a much nicer place than an actual prison. We get paid to be here. We go home afterwards and have social lives. We have... we have parties here. They're teasing you. To be funny.
Think you could...[wants to hand the camera to Jim, but Jim is starting to snuggle up with Pam, posing.  Toby aims the camera, the flash pops up] Okay. [takes picture] Okay.
Yeah, it just means whoever complained came to me later and withdrew it, so I took their name off.
Sorry guys, but I don't think I tipped him for last year's.
You know, I always knew if Michael just took the time to get to know me, we'd become friends.
Toy Story 2, one of the best movies I ever saw. I went for my daughter and stayed because you can't leave your daughter in a theater.
[after awkward pause] Sh, uh, um, I was having this separate conversation with Kevin. Uh, Johnny Depp.
A little ironic that I'm going to be kind of a TV star, because my last Chad Flendermen novel [groups groans] was based on a murdered TV star. The small screen-
Hey, Andy, Nobody's calling you crazy, Andy. We're your friends, Andy.
I'd like you to imagine a place where you feel very peaceful. For me, it's the walk from the yogurt shop to my car after I drop my daughter off on Sunday afternoons.
Alright, well then you can ask about religious beliefs.
Well, I am trained in grief counseling, but, ahh, I don't think that's what they need right now.
Well, you know how everyone fast forwards through ads these days? Well, what about an ad in slow motion. You know, if they fast forward through it, it'll just seem normal and it will catch your eye. Plus, uh, the slogan could be: Dunder Mifflin, we adapt to the pace of your business. [murmurs of approval by everyone but Michael]
Alright, just know that you're not in the Finer Things Club.
Hey I left my glasses down here somewhere. Crossing through, beep beep. [Pam's plane hit Toby in the eye]
You know what would be the hottest thing ever? It���s a pregnant Helen Mirren.
No, no, no, no, no. Women chase him. He misses his wife.
...and, yeah, the whole thing was incredibly cathartic.
Michael's behavior is erratic and unpredictable, but I don't think he's doing drugs. Maybe he should. Take the edge off. Uh, not at work, of course.
I can neither confirm nor deny this. Let's just say I'll be up to my neck in jury duty. [excited outbursts]
Yeah, and I, uh, I think that the very fact that we're including it in our agenda frankly, is a big step forward.
Under the stars. It was really beautiful, you should come.
[entering Andy's office] Knock, knock. Hey, Sasha's first year in the troops, so I'm selling cookies for her. Anyway, would you like some?
Hey, hey what are- why are you doing this?
It was actually kind of hard to meet people I found.
I don't know how I'm going to get through this. I don't want to lie and I DON'T want to tell the truth.
Um, ex-wife. Yeah. Um, her last name is 'Becker' now.
I always thought he might have been set up but I felt pressured to convict.
[to Darryl] Hey, you tricked me. You just wanted Kevin.
Oh, yeah, no, it���s okay. I can handle it. Um, so���
Oh, I don���t know. I might turn in early.
It's very important for you to be liked, isn't it?
Oh, there's a whole 'nother terrorism booklet for that.
Yeah... that's why they pay me the big bucks.  [both laugh]
Fingerprints can be planted. You know with a severed hand...
Well, we fired Roy, obviously.  And Jim won't press charges against Roy or the company.
Cause Ryan asked me to talk to you.
Y'know I've been going over my notes from the trial...
Hey, I just got the word on the communal birthdays. Great idea.
Thanks, I'm gonna set it to Costa Rica time.
We can play something more complicated if you like.
[To Nellie in the kitchen] Here's the thing about moonlight. It's not sunlight.
Well, look, sometimes things crop up later. So, uhh, you should know I'm always available if anyone would like to talk.
The simple solution would be to open a window... if we had... windows that could open.
Hey, is that Michael?  Does he miss me?  [laughs]  Uh, Oscar?  Are you there?  Hello? [sighs]
Yeah, um, but now apparently Darryl has some issue with his...
I should not be here. I���m in the- I was in the wrong- I���m- I���m sorry. Uh, just picture me back there. I- I was never here.
Well, it's one of my strengths, but it's the manager's job.
Jan told me just a few minutes before she told you.
Hey, what's going on? There's a police car in the...
You--you might consider pulling it down a touch.  It's ri--it's riding up a little high.
Thanks man! [awkwardly tries to hug Ryan, pats him on the back]
Hey... [sees both Jim and Pam] you two.
So Dwight and Darryl came to an agreement that both would file complaints with corporate and now I get to do all this paperwork.  We worked it out.
Do- Well you should give him a little time to settle in. But-
No.  Can't, can't you just get up yourself?  I... You only grilled your foot.
Well, um, it was amazing.  It really was, thanks for asking.  Um the beaches were pristine...
Um, if, uh... um... I just completely forgot what I was going to say. It's so weird.
If I won the lottery, I don't know. I don't think I'd make any changes to my life. Quit my job, move, meet someone....
Just letting Oscar vent a little. We would use the break room, but the photographer's back there today.
Well, as you know, Ed Truck passed away. So, I'm here to talk about it if anyone would like to.
I w-, uh, I would love to give uh-
Oh, you guys. Kelly called it. 2013. So s���hey! Hey! Hey, no! No! Get outta here. Clark, get outta here.
Honestly, I don't even hear her anymore. It's like waves crashing against the beach.
Hey guys.  This is my, uh, girlfriend, Amy.
Andy, you know I can���t do that. It���d be lying.
No, I mean he's attracted to other men.
[crosses finish line] And the winner is Toby Flenderson.
I'd like to introduce you to my replacement.
I'm makin' great time. Usually I have to take a bathroom break half way through a race like this, but not today.
Michael, look.  I know this is hard for you, but death's just a part of life.  I mean, just this morning I saw a little bird fly into the glass doors downstairs and die.  And I had to keep going.
Apparently you called Oscar 'faggie' for liking the movie Shakespeare in Love more than an action movie.
[leans hobo sack against the refrigerator] It's a great stick, right?
Oh, cool. It looks really interesting. What did you end up with? [Ryan pulls Creed's old coat out of a bag] Sorry.
So this is H.R. This is your desk.
That���s true. There���s no rule. You can check the employee handbook. Oh, can I check the employee handbook Lloyd? Well, does it say anything about me choking a man with my bare hands?
He might start by asking each of you, ���Why do you think you���re here?���
You know, I actually lived in Honolulu for a year.
I don't report to you, Michael. I report to the head of HR in New York.
Hey Dwight. Pretty nice robe- [Dwight grabs bag with robe in it and walks away.] Why?
Maybe not some of them. Maybe not inappropriate ones.
I just though you could add me.  I don't see the harm in that.
Oh, Andy, we had this exact same conversation when you wanted to get rid of Nellie. You can't just get rid of people over grudges.
You can't, [Michael touches his forehead and makes sizzling noise] Ow. Look, you cannot push religion.
I don't really think people are in the laughing mood.
This is a bloodbath. Alright, I���m calling this.
I know right?  I just want to go, and look at art, and swim in the Adriatic.
Okay, that's hurtful talk. We've talked about that. You know, I don't interrupt your announcements.
There���s no shame in getting beaten up by a girl. My ex-wife used to demolish me.
This is fun. You know? I mean, this is fun.
This may be the first time that a male subordinate has attempted to get a modest scheduled raise by threatening to withhold sex from a female superior.  It will be a groundbreaking case when it inevitably goes to trial.
Ahhh, kay.  Look, we could all file complaints against each other and just drown in a sea of paperwork, but you know, we can just move on with our... with our lives.
When I put it in I thought it would be a waste of time, but I guess it was worth it.
Yeah. I have my dignity too. I refuse to be another man's horsey.
You know what Michael? You're right. You win. This is pointless. We're not getting anywhere. I got a bunch of fun stuff, in case my daughter ever comes over. Why don't we just run out the clock by playing games, drawing some pictures, talking?
Maybe you could just take the rest of the day off... you know...
[excitedly] Oh, I should get the accident report binder. I've never used the gun violence forms before.
[in a hospital bed, watching Entourage in Spanish] Oh, I went zip lining my third day in Costa Rica.  I guess the harness wasn't strapped in exactly right.  I broke my neck.  And, I've been in the hospital five weeks now.  I still haven't seen the beach.  It's nice to have visitors.
You know, uh, what does it mean to be happy. [shakes head] Keep philosophers busy for awhile.
Guys. Really, it's ok. Everyone has made a really solid first impression, I don't think there's any reason for anybody to worry.
They would just send someone else. You need to have an HR representative.
I could loan you a pair of socks.
Me, Dan from Buffalo, Mark Chisholm, Jeff from Albany and Ryan, obviously. Made so many s'mores, that I finally had to say, 'No more s'mores, no more s'mores.' [everyone in room but Michael laughs, Michael exits break room]
Hey, uh... where'd you decide to take Karen tonight?
Okay.  And-- the-the power-- comes from the back foot.  So its-- its all one motion through the-- body.  So you stay a little low and there's a twist.  You keep your shoulder down and you kind of throw out the arm.  [demonstrates punch] Pow!
It's digital, so just take as many as you want.
Well, and you have a... yes, a- d- another chateau.
I don't think Michael intended to punish me, by putting Ryan back here with Kelly.  But, if he did intend that?  Wow.  Genius.
These things just have a way of working themselves out.
Office relationships are never a good idea. Yeah. So let's just try to avoid them. But, um, if you already have one, you should disclose it to HR.
Pam, can I talk to you for a second?
Ok, I mean, I could talk to her.
Um, why don't you go ask him that?
Okay, I think we should probably be okay.
I like it just us three.  [very quietly] I don't want it to change.
Angela, what do you want me to do?
Alright, it's getting gooier so we'll just do it later.
I-I think we hang out an appropriate amount of time.
Casual Fridays are cancelled.  [everyone protests]  Let's just not do it anymore.
You know this sounds a lot like the premise of my latest Chad Flendermen novel. A murder for framing.
Uh, I really think that you need to address what happened with Stanley this morning...
I can't talk about it or I'll get removed from the jury.
This here is a radon test kit. [holding out tiny cylinder disc] Okay I will be putting 'em everywhere. And... please don't throw these out. [starts snapping towards Michael's face] This is a radon test kit. [continues snapping] Please don't throw these out. [Michael gives annoyed look] See them all over the office.
Okay, look, in a real crisis situation, you���re not gonna have to time to think, okay? So just remember, I-A-A-T-G. ���It���s all about the groin.���
[stands outside church entrance] Okay, this is, all right, this is silly. [goes inside] [walks back out] Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope...
Toby, you are playing a dangerous game. Guess I'm through the gateway now, though, right?
Hey, um did you go to uh, Bishop O'Hara?
[to Phyllis and Stanley] What are you guys talking about? I have a daughter. How can I be a virgin?
There���s two new guys back there with me now. They���re in their 20s. And we really get along.
���..Chad Flendermen's kryptonite. [Darryl walks up to Toby and Val in a tuxedo]
I was-- I was gonna get the doll.
That was... I went to Costa Rica for a few months.  What is going on?
Really? You were gonna throw out a book?
You can't claim territories. This is the only place I interact with people. Can't you sell at your church or barber shop? [Darryl looks hurt] Or chess club, or?
No, I did not violate an Indian burial ground. In fact I had some good luck recently, Alfredo's Pizza, picked my business card out of the basket, so... uh, I got a week of free pies.
[Michael and Holly are still working on the chair] What'd you guys do?
Michael, we are only allowed to talk about Meredith's work performance. We can not ask her to stop drinking.
Believe me, she has enough toys... she doesn't need your watch.
Uh, Holly Flax, she comes from the Nashua branch.
[laughs] Oh man, thanks, thank you, [tearing up] thank you, thank you.
Actually, I didn't think it was appropriate to invite children since it's... You know, there's gambling and alcohol, and it's in our dangerous warehouse and it's a school night... And, you know, Hooters is catering. You know, is that enough? Should I keep going?
Wow, I'd love to take a look at that.
Here's how I usually handle this: all I do is listen.
[to passing female pedestrian] Smile if you love men���s prostates.
I will send this off to corporate.  Make sure you hold on to your medical bills.  Feel better.
You know, why don't we split the order? It's only fair.
Andy, it's not the original. And destroying it will not stop them from dating. Andy. [Andy throws paper at him and leaves, Toby straightens paper out] It's the original.
Yeah, I also learned some interesting things about how they structure...
I guess I shouldn't have stopped for dinner.
Pete���s a pretty cool guy, though, and Andy was a terrible lover to Erin. He basically ignored her and left on a boat.
[alone in cab} After Dwight fired me, I moved to New York to write the great American novel. I have six roommates. Heh. Which are better than friends, you know ���cause they have to give you one month���s notice before they leave.
Thanks... [Hank is standing next to Michael] Really, Michael?
Well, Kelly's been so upset about Ryan dumping her, that she can't even talk. [grins]
Looks like we kicked it. [indicates water jug is empty]
I'll have Erin fax them back to corporate.
You can't fire Pete. You understand why, right?
No, no, no. It's not fair. What if Kevin wants to buy cookies from me?
Yeah, uh, she'll be starting next week. If you have any questions about the transition, just let me know.
[on the computer] No, but I'm going zip lining tomorrow, through the, through the rainforest, with this cool couple I, I met at my hotel.  Wo-woman's amazing...
Every Friday at 4, I have a standing appointment with Dwight for him to file a grievance against Jim. I tell him that I'm sending them to a special file in New York. That box is the special file in New York.
I know, um, but Ryan thinks that, uh, they're not good enough.
I think we might be about to maybe really get somewhere.
Oh, it wasn't camping, it was more of a wilderness retreat. [Michael walks in]
[nods] ...You know, I, uh, I know a little about what you're going through in a way. Um, when I was a kid, my parents got divorced. They both wanted custody, and they both asked me to testify against the other one in court. So, I don't know, I didn't want them getting divorced in the first place you know? I loved them both so much. I just wanted... [Michael pushes Toby's food tray off the table and walks off]
Uh, you know what, I can go park it myself.
[gesturing to the rest of the office] This is everybody else... okay... This is the place... so thanks for the lift.
There's this female uh, uh, stenographer at the courthouse...
Well for a minute there, I saw myself selling my house, moving to Costa Rica, learning how to surf. But, Costa Rica will still be there. When I'm 65.
...and you bounce it off the wall on your side of the tape.
Well, I don't think there's any reason to check 'em but I suppose if we wanted to be really certain...
There were two or three 'sorry's in there. [mumbles along with Nellie]
Well, it... there was. But Michael scheduled it for 4:58 on a Friday. You know, people sang in the parking lot.
It's a little tricky, you might have to... take... [Mose speeds away]
Talk to Michael. I gave him the box.
It happens, okay? Uh, so let's just find an empty desk for you, and uh, I'm sure Robert will be with you as soon as he gets in.
[on speakerphone] Well you know, frankly a lot of us have been saying this for a long time.
Technically, I am in Human Resources. And Dwight was asking about human anatomy. Um... I'm just sad the public school system failed him so badly.
Well, good.  We can, uh, throw that one out. [shuffles through papers]
[standing in the church sanctuary, talking to the stained glass] Why you always got to be so mean to me?
I don't think Pam's gonna want to come into the men's room.
[on video cam with his brother] Here's the thing Rory, I knew you guys would hit it off in an odd way.
Tough? I put an innocent man on death row.
Um... I need to talk to you in your office. It'll just take two seconds.
If you turn out the lights we'll do a little dance.
Hey Darryl, look ahhh, we're here to apologize ahh...
Well, why would you need relocation, if you already live in Scranton?
A few years ago, when I was on the jury of the Scranton Strangler..
Sure. Wow. [Michael throws a pen at his head] Ow...
It's, uh... I was... might ask if you wanted...
Michael, this is really inappropriate to talk about.
All right, if you're having a relationship with your superior, you must disclose it.
I normally do nothing, I guess. No, you shouldn't- [Holly knocks on Michael's door]
You know it���s not just pregnant women who don���t get their due. You know who���s gorgeous? Helen Mirren.
No it's not. It's a type of pipe. You can fill it with tobacco, often mixed with fruit, or other flavors.
How will your experience selling refinery equipment translate to our smaller scale here?
Michael. Why's everyone locked in the conference room?
Every Halloween I tell him the same thing - You can't bring weapons into the office, and every year he says the same thing - As soon as I get my weapons back I'm gonna kill you. But there I am at Thanksgiving, alive, you know. I'm a lucky turkey.
You just got your corporate credit card back. Do you really want me to take it away again?
So remember, intent is irrelevant. And that's it. Pam?
I already signed it. I was just showing you.
Hey, I'd like to buy one of your dolls.
Michael, I have one extra twin bed, if you want.
If we don't patronise the only Syrian restaurant in town, there'll be nothing left but pan pizzas and make-your-own salads.
Um, yeah.  You're computer screen can be a big strain on your eyes, so uh, it's also recommended that you step away for about... about ten minutes every hour.
All right, look, what you gotta understand is that when you come to work, you give up certain rights.
Sorry. Hey, Toby Flenderson. Nice to meet you. How can I help?
Robert did say you'd be joining us. Welcome. I'm Tony.
But now it's being looked at as more of a productivity issue.
Well, as you know, Dwight has filed a lot of complaints against you over the years.
What are, are you doing at my desk?
I called Tallahassee. He can ask you not to come in, but he can't dock your pay. That's not legal.
Well, it's important to support local art, you know. And what they do is not art.
I'd say all the goofing around at Pam's desk, and, and hanging out with Pam, has finally caught up to him... w-with Pam
Actually, she's right. This isn't appropriate. Why don't I take these.
You���re really there to talk to each other. I would say that the therapist is more of a facilitator.
Hey, really nice job in that meeting in there.
Come on Dwight. We went over this, like for a half an hour.
I love The Finer Things Club.  My ex-wife used to have a book club, and I would read their book and sometimes listen from the kitchen.
[Michael hands him a present] Wow, thanks, Michael, I...
[gets up and puts a hand on Michael's shoulder] Buddy, I think that...
Well that's sweet, I missed you guys too.
Hey, this came with the Stamford book. [Sets down box that says: Personnel Files Stamford CT Office Confidential] Can you take care of it?
I am supposed to collect eyewitness accounts. Who saw Dwight do this? [all raise their hands]
Michael, We should contact some experts.  You don't know what your doing.
How are you? Hey. Welcome back. [puts out fist to bump]
[singing and dancing] Dem bones, dem bones, dem tired bones, now we're the skeleton crew.
I can't believe this. [mistaking Darryl's sister for Darryl] Hey you, ass****!
It was Ryan wanted Michael, the subject, to explain the computer system, the object.
Alright, I wasn't expecting that. Let's uh... let's go draw.
Oh, no, I-- no, no, I was gonna buy that doll.
Do you see David Wallace in the room right now?
Hey Nellie. Mmm. I am so sick of February. It's the shortest month but it sure doesn't feel that way. We should catch up.
