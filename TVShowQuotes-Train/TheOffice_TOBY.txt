Oh, no, I-- no, no, I was gonna buy that doll.
Uh, Holly Flax, she comes from the Nashua branch.
That really hurt. I'm writing you up. [Angela makes an angry face] Hey, you are not allowed to touch other employees. Am I being clear?
You know I don't have to do the paperwork unless you're actually dating.
Maybe you could just take the rest of the day off... you know...
You gonna eat all that dog food yourself?
I am so glad I got all of the dudes to do Movember. We have the dopest time back in the annex.
Okay.  And-- the-the power-- comes from the back foot.  So its-- its all one motion through the-- body.  So you stay a little low and there's a twist.  You keep your shoulder down and you kind of throw out the arm.  [demonstrates punch] Pow!
No.  Can't, can't you just get up yourself?  I... You only grilled your foot.
Can't you just not look at his feet?
They would just send someone else. You need to have an HR representative.
You can't claim territories. This is the only place I interact with people. Can't you sell at your church or barber shop? [Darryl looks hurt] Or chess club, or?
Ah, you should probably deal with that outside of the work place.
I-I think we hang out an appropriate amount of time.
I would spend a lot of time launching my true crime podcast, The Flenderson Files. Dum bum buh. [whispers] Flenderson files.
Well, as you know, Ed Truck passed away. So, I'm here to talk about it if anyone would like to.
Hey, Andy, Nobody's calling you crazy, Andy. We're your friends, Andy.
Hey Dwight. Pretty nice robe- [Dwight grabs bag with robe in it and walks away.] Why?
Yeah, I don't know why you picked names that are also guys' names.
Well, we fired Roy, obviously.  And Jim won't press charges against Roy or the company.
Hey guys.  This is my, uh, girlfriend, Amy.
Thanks... [Hank is standing next to Michael] Really, Michael?
Yeah... that's why they pay me the big bucks.  [both laugh]
I don't... I don't think we can do that.
I'm gonna... I'll go get one. Stay. [runs out of the office]
[laughs] Oh man, thanks, thank you, [tearing up] thank you, thank you.
No, I would never ever do anything like that. But it does seem like something you would do.
I wouldn't want to do that now would I?
It's just a little dispute over a poster in their workspace.
Okay, that is fine to feel, but not to act on.
So Dwight and Darryl came to an agreement that both would file complaints with corporate and now I get to do all this paperwork.  We worked it out.
It���s going to be nice to have just a healthy, young, fit presence in the middle of the office.
Oh, there's a whole 'nother terrorism booklet for that.
Hey, is that Michael?  Does he miss me?  [laughs]  Uh, Oscar?  Are you there?  Hello? [sighs]
It was Ryan wanted Michael, the subject, to explain the computer system, the object.
Yeah, I also learned some interesting things about how they structure...
���..Chad Flendermen's kryptonite. [Darryl walks up to Toby and Val in a tuxedo]
...and, yeah, the whole thing was incredibly cathartic.
It's out of context.  It's not the same as driving.
I���ve seen guys like you. Big guys who like to push the little guys around. Lloyd Gross eats bullies like you for breakfast.
Anyone can follow a Twitter feed. Wanna share a cab?
Yeah, okay. Corporate would like us to do a five minute review of the Company Sexual Harassment policy so I'll go over that later.
This here is a radon test kit. [holding out tiny cylinder disc] Okay I will be putting 'em everywhere. And... please don't throw these out. [starts snapping towards Michael's face] This is a radon test kit. [continues snapping] Please don't throw these out. [Michael gives annoyed look] See them all over the office.
Well that's sweet, I missed you guys too.
Andy, you know I can���t do that. It���d be lying.
Fine, I'll take your name off. [looks at Michael] So no one will know.
[leans hobo sack against the refrigerator] It's a great stick, right?
I don't think the women in this office -
Michael, this is really inappropriate to talk about.
The simple solution would be to open a window... if we had... windows that could open.
I normally do nothing, I guess. No, you shouldn't- [Holly knocks on Michael's door]
Really? You were gonna throw out a book?
It���s interesting that you���re drawn to the point of view of the attacker. ��You would like the turn of the table. Okay, the latest Chad Flenderman novel... [everyone groans] written from the point of view of his nemesis, Dr. Lucifer Wu.
Concentrating? Is anyone having trouble getting their work done today?
Y'know I've been going over my notes from the trial...
Michael, we are only allowed to talk about Meredith's work performance. We can not ask her to stop drinking.
I am on the wrong side, and I am freaking out here.
I'm going to the prison. This afternoon. I'm gonna talk to the strangler.
You know who's not gonna get to work on some exciting new startup this year? George Howard Skub, a.k.a. the alleged Scranton strangler, because he's in prison [Jim and Daryl walk out of the kitchen] for something he may not have done.
Sorry. Hey, Toby Flenderson. Nice to meet you. How can I help?
Well, it's important to support local art, you know. And what they do is not art.
Jan told me just a few minutes before she told you.
You know what would be the hottest thing ever? It���s a pregnant Helen Mirren.
Well, um, it was amazing.  It really was, thanks for asking.  Um the beaches were pristine...
I can refer you to someone to talk to.
I���m just curious though, what do you have against Pete and Erin?
I don't think laughing about it is an appropriate response.
I don't know how I'm going to get through this. I don't want to lie and I DON'T want to tell the truth.
Chad Flendermen. Just an easy going black guy, he knows the streets, yet he also went to Oxford. So. Just as comfortable on a motorcycle as he is on Air Force One. Oh and he's also the world's leading Egyptologist.
Yeah, maybe when you get really comfortable with each other, you can ask for that.
We should really have the office's air quality tested. We have radon coming from below, we have asbestos in the ceilings. These are silent killers.
Yeah, er... pull up a chair or sit on the shredder.
I could, sure. Have a seat. I would start at the beginning, but I think I need to go farther back.
Well, we could try him out for a little while... [Jim drops his pen, looks exasperated] and if it doesn't work out, you know, maybe one of us could, you know, step in...
Now, we���re actually a lot closer to Binghamton than you are. Kimosabe.
Uh, well, we probably don't want to go just on seniority.
Alright... Well, um, if you really believe that Stanley was joking...
You know but the police could have been out there you know, catching real criminals instead of here searching my stuff.
I don't think Pam's gonna want to come into the men's room.
Do- Well you should give him a little time to settle in. But-
I'm sorry, if we did something to upset you, I'm sure it was inadvertent.
All right, now Oscar's feeling discriminated against by his co-workers, primarily Angela, and um, that's your fault.
[standing behind Erin] I don't think this fax is going through. Is there a different... I can just put it through again, you know.
You know they're teasing you. I mean... obviously, this is... a much nicer place than an actual prison. We get paid to be here. We go home afterwards and have social lives. We have... we have parties here. They're teasing you. To be funny.
Actually, she's right. This isn't appropriate. Why don't I take these.
He might start by asking each of you, ���Why do you think you���re here?���
Forcing your employees to set you up is not a, uh, uh, technical violation of any Dunder Mifflin rule.  You know, but neither is forcing them to help you with a shot-by-shot remake of Indiana Jones.  Huh-how do you make a rule book like that?
A guy on my street fell off a ladder painting his house.  It was on the news.
As part of my last day I'm training the new Human Resources rep in the ways of the company. Again, the company has allotted for this training-one day.
OK I think Oscar would just like if you used 'lame' or something like that.
So, how would you go about settling interpersonal conflicts within the office?
When I put it in I thought it would be a waste of time, but I guess it was worth it.
I just though you could add me.  I don't see the harm in that.
And then Corporate is going to send in a lawyer...
Here's how I usually handle this: all I do is listen.
I got Angela. She is into these posters of babies dressed as adults. I got her one of those. I felt kind of weird buying that.
Okay, you get a one-second hold on the ball...
Pam, can I talk to you for a second?
Now, if your attacker is willing to defile a corpse, you better stop playing dead right away and just make it known that you���re alive.
Yeah, I'm really looking forward to working with you, Michael.
Well, you're going to have to let 'em out. Or... or I will.
Michael, I'm your HR Rep. I'm on your side.
Um, if, uh... um... I just completely forgot what I was going to say. It's so weird.
[sighing] Look, it's a free country. If she wants to throw a party...
Do you see David Wallace in the room right now?
Oh, I don���t know. I might turn in early.
Except you just told me you were gonna make it up. Now if she sues, I have to testify against you.
A little ironic that I'm going to be kind of a TV star, because my last Chad Flendermen novel [groups groans] was based on a murdered TV star. The small screen-
[crosses finish line] And the winner is Toby Flenderson.
Actually, I have a separate folder for complaints against Michael. This [unlocks a drawer]is January through March of this year. [pulls out a fairly large folder]
Hey, I just got the word on the communal birthdays. Great idea.
I spent three years in advertising before I came here.
Um, yeah.  You're computer screen can be a big strain on your eyes, so uh, it's also recommended that you step away for about... about ten minutes every hour.
Alright, well look. While I have you here, this is a relationship disclosure form for Pete & Erin.
Look, you know, in any company  there's going to be certain degrees -
Michael, We should contact some experts.  You don't know what your doing.
Well, why would you need relocation, if you already live in Scranton?
Oh, you guys. Kelly called it. 2013. So s���hey! Hey! Hey, no! No! Get outta here. Clark, get outta here.
A few years ago, when I was on the jury of the Scranton Strangler..
Well, the most common scenario is a larger man attacking a smaller female.
No it's not. It's a type of pipe. You can fill it with tobacco, often mixed with fruit, or other flavors.
It happens, okay? Uh, so let's just find an empty desk for you, and uh, I'm sure Robert will be with you as soon as he gets in.
Uh, we're on recess. I came for the party. Hey, everyone.
More like 'Everyone let's get your boss laid Saturday.' [more laughs] [Toby puts his hand on Pam's knee, everyone stares, Toby removes his hand] I have an announcement uh, to make. I am moving to Costa Rica. Thought about it for a long time now. And I'm finally gonna do it. So, I'm just gonna hop the fence and jog home now. [runs out of lobby and climbs the fence and jogs away]
But I mean���uh have you talked to her? Is sh���
This is the prison. Uh, I am not going in there with expectations, per say. Uh, I will meet George Howard Scubb. I will tell him that I believe he is innocent. I would understand if he felt motivated to hug me. I would understand if a friendship began. How did, how did Bogart put it? [imitating Humphrey Bogart] I think this is a start of my first friendship.
Okay, look, in a real crisis situation, you���re not gonna have to time to think, okay? So just remember, I-A-A-T-G. ���It���s all about the groin.���
Andy, it's not the original. And destroying it will not stop them from dating. Andy. [Andy throws paper at him and leaves, Toby straightens paper out] It's the original.
Yeah, I assumed Michael was already doing this.  That's why I only use my personal e-mail account.
Okay, I���m at what���s called ���the decision point.���
Miami University in Ohio. On her last day, Kelly was still a little confused about it
Tough? I put an innocent man on death row.
Yeah, um, but now apparently Darryl has some issue with his...
Looks like we kicked it. [indicates water jug is empty]
Uh, I just wanted to let you know that, uh, I'll be taking a leave of absence starting next week.
Hey. Hey, you know, I just realized uh, I don't have a picture of the two of us.
You know, when I was on j-duty, uh, Strangler case, we used to recreate the various stranglings with empanadas from- at Ernesto's.
You know, I always knew if Michael just took the time to get to know me, we'd become friends.
Oh, when you sign your job application you agree to comply with random drug testing.
How are you? Hey. Welcome back. [puts out fist to bump]
Andy, we wanted to talk to you. A lot of us are very concerned about you.
I will send this off to corporate.  Make sure you hold on to your medical bills.  Feel better.
Michael, nine different people emailed me that photo, including my ex-wife... we don't talk now.
[whispering] I am not doing your dirty work for you.
I guess I shouldn't have stopped for dinner.
There's not a single appropriate outfit in this whole--except mine, quite honestly.
Yeah. I have my dignity too. I refuse to be another man's horsey.
[gets up and puts a hand on Michael's shoulder] Buddy, I think that...
[on phone] Hey Sasha, it's daddy.  Have you ever heard of this doll , Princess Unicorn?
You know, uh, what does it mean to be happy. [shakes head] Keep philosophers busy for awhile.
Oh, yeah, no, it���s okay. I can handle it. Um, so���
Um... I need to talk to you in your office. It'll just take two seconds.
Just letting Oscar vent a little. We would use the break room, but the photographer's back there today.
Two dimes, seven nickels--Well, okay, no, that doesn't add up. It was one quarter and--
I'm makin' great time. Usually I have to take a bathroom break half way through a race like this, but not today.
No, no.  Um, you always want to keep a sweater or cardigan of some sort, in case it gets drafty.
There were two or three 'sorry's in there. [mumbles along with Nellie]
We even go to lunch, pick up babes.
This is great.  My ex-wife's going to be so pissed.  [chuckles] For once daddy's gonna be a hero.
Apparently you called Oscar 'faggie' for liking the movie Shakespeare in Love more than an action movie.
This is a picture I've been carrying around in my wallet for about six years.  It's this unspoiled beach in Costa Rica, Playa Grande.  Um, I take it out when I get stressed or depressed, and it really calms me down.  Never thought I'd get to live here, you know.  But it turns out they built these great new condos there, so, this could be me, right around, uh, where the trees used to be.
I could loan you a pair of socks.
The full story is that Randall resigned because of sexual harassment. So Corporate asked me to do a five minute review of the Company Sexual Harassment policy.
There���s two new guys back there with me now. They���re in their 20s. And we really get along.
Oh, it wasn't camping, it was more of a wilderness retreat. [Michael walks in]
Guys, I think Michael and Luke are related.
Michael, it's up to me to check off the boxes, and I can't do that unless I honestly...
No, I mean he's attracted to other men.
What are, are you doing at my desk?
I knew it. I knew it from the beginning it was possible.
[in a hospital bed, watching Entourage in Spanish] Oh, I went zip lining my third day in Costa Rica.  I guess the harness wasn't strapped in exactly right.  I broke my neck.  And, I've been in the hospital five weeks now.  I still haven't seen the beach.  It's nice to have visitors.
Wow, I'd love to take a look at that.
You know it���s not just pregnant women who don���t get their due. You know who���s gorgeous? Helen Mirren.
Robert did say you'd be joining us. Welcome. I'm Tony.
Me, Dan from Buffalo, Mark Chisholm, Jeff from Albany and Ryan, obviously. Made so many s'mores, that I finally had to say, 'No more s'mores, no more s'mores.' [everyone in room but Michael laughs, Michael exits break room]
Ok, I mean, I could talk to her.
You think I have a machine for measuring bee hives?
Yeah, um... I can���t believe you remembered. I do self-defense. Um, I���ll go put on my cup.
Alright, well then you can ask about religious beliefs.
[excitedly] Oh, I should get the accident report binder. I've never used the gun violence forms before.
Alright, I wasn't expecting that. Let's uh... let's go draw.
I love it. I love it... I would love a picture of the two of us, to also take to Costa Rica.
[opening kite from Ryan] Wow! Cause... [reveals Kite Runner book]
I-- I don���t know if there���s truth to-- to, uh, to that.
I am supposed to collect eyewitness accounts. Who saw Dwight do this? [all raise their hands]
Yeah. Um, you mind if I get a picture?
Unless part of you made that mistake on purpose.
[To Nellie in the kitchen] Here's the thing about moonlight. It's not sunlight.
Uh, you know what, I can go park it myself.
Yes, uh some people in the office have complained...
No, no, no, no, no. Women chase him. He misses his wife.
That���s true. There���s no rule. You can check the employee handbook. Oh, can I check the employee handbook Lloyd? Well, does it say anything about me choking a man with my bare hands?
Well, and you have a... yes, a- d- another chateau.
I called Tallahassee. He can ask you not to come in, but he can't dock your pay. That's not legal.
That was... I went to Costa Rica for a few months.  What is going on?
[walks up to Pam's desk with a binder] Hey Pam, could I talk to you for a sec?
I- I said I'm Tony. Okay I made a mistake. I thought it might go unnoticed. But uh, I'm Toby.
Ah, this reminds me of the HR convention last fall.
Hey, um did you go to uh, Bishop O'Hara?
Hey, I'd like to buy one of your dolls.
I think we might be about to maybe really get somewhere.
I don't think Michael intended to punish me, by putting Ryan back here with Kelly.  But, if he did intend that?  Wow.  Genius.
But now it's being looked at as more of a productivity issue.
[tossing forms at Michael] Just fill them out any way you want.
If we don't patronise the only Syrian restaurant in town, there'll be nothing left but pan pizzas and make-your-own salads.
Oh thanks.  She's gonna... [notices the doll is black] oh...
I should not be here. I���m in the- I was in the wrong- I���m- I���m sorry. Uh, just picture me back there. I- I was never here.
OK, I am telling you, Oscar is an actual homosexual.  Yeah, he told me this morning.  And, obviously he hopes he can count on your discretion.
Thanks, I'm gonna set it to Costa Rica time.
I didn't put caprese salad in my drawer, Michael.
No, I did not violate an Indian burial ground. In fact I had some good luck recently, Alfredo's Pizza, picked my business card out of the basket, so... uh, I got a week of free pies.
I have like, like a blue shirt? I don't wear a lot of colors, I have a lot of tan. Uh huh.
[sits down for his ID picture] Just take it. [flashes goes off, while he is standing back up again]
[after awkward pause] Sh, uh, um, I was having this separate conversation with Kevin. Uh, Johnny Depp.
Well, look, sometimes things crop up later. So, uhh, you should know I'm always available if anyone would like to talk.
Oh, sure, lots of times. Yeah. Wait, you and Pam aren���t in couple���s counseling, are you? Oh, God.
Kelly Kapoor is gone. Her fianc�� Ravi was hired as a pediatrics professor at Miami university.
I made it this far, right? What's the point?
Under the stars. It was really beautiful, you should come.
You���re really there to talk to each other. I would say that the therapist is more of a facilitator.
I like to think Lloyd Gross is a no-nonsense guy who doesn���t back down from anybody. And he calls people ���Kimosabe���.
No, no,... no. Sorry. We cut Kevin off for the same thing. You have to have something to say, if you talk. [Angela rolls her eyes and stops talking]
Hey, look what I found in the back. [shows a football to Pam] Wanna play? Teach you to throw.
That... [shakes head and places hand over the file]
Not much? What's up with you? [from bathroom above] Nah it's okay. I'm in the bathroom. Hey you been watching Damages this year? It's so good. No, you gotta tune in, it's as good as anything on HBO. [sound of pissing] Hey does blue go with tan?
Well, I don't think there's any reason to check 'em but I suppose if we wanted to be really certain...
Well, Kelly's been so upset about Ryan dumping her, that she can't even talk. [grins]
It's very important for you to be liked, isn't it?
I don���t know if this is gonna help...Uh...
Well, it... there was. But Michael scheduled it for 4:58 on a Friday. You know, people sang in the parking lot.
She's going to be screaming her own last name?
[Michael and Holly are still working on the chair] What'd you guys do?
Well, uh, okay. Um.  It's really great to be here tonight, with the Ferris wheel, the band, and the low sunlight.  I'm gonna miss you all when I go to Costa Rica, and if I keep drinking beer like this, I'm gonna have to take a leak-a. [laughter from audience, Michael looks at camera unhappily]  Look, on a more personal note, I just want to say thanks, you know, no matter what was going on in my life, you know, my divorce, or the custody battle, or that thing with my sister, it was just nice knowing I had a, a supportive place to come to where...
All right, look, what you gotta understand is that when you come to work, you give up certain rights.
Kevin.  His gambling problem must've resurfaced. I'm gonna have to send him home until I can do an investigation.
Sorry guys, but I don't think I tipped him for last year's.
Come on Dwight. We went over this, like for a half an hour.
[to Kevin] Honestly, is there any way you can get on your fiancee's plan? Our health plan is s... just... it's terrible.
Ryan invited me to go on his wilderness adventure retreat. It was this amazing, beautiful experience [Michael knocks on the window behind Toby from outside]
Cause Ryan asked me to talk to you.
Self-defense is not some fun boxing match, okay? This is about escaping with your life. So... strike, scream, and run. All right? Let���s try it.
Ahhh, kay.  Look, we could all file complaints against each other and just drown in a sea of paperwork, but you know, we can just move on with our... with our lives.
Um, yeah, ah, ah, that means a lot.  Thank you for saying it.
Yeah. So anyway, the entire jury wants me to vote guilty. But then I did a little research of my own, and forget everything you thought you knew about fingerprinting.
You know, for your own protection, you should disclose the relationship to HR.
I w-, uh, I would love to give uh-
Great.  Because you that I think the very fact that [Michael mutes the call]
Hey, what's going on?  You don't have my permission to do this.
You--you might consider pulling it down a touch.  It's ri--it's riding up a little high.
[Warehouse Worker Frank remains silent, picks ear] You sort of deserve an apology here. Frank?
Hey, uh... where'd you decide to take Karen tonight?
No, no, no. It's not fair. What if Kevin wants to buy cookies from me?
If you turn out the lights we'll do a little dance.
Well I guess this weddings not going to happen.  I wonder if this is it for them.  [Jim and Pam walk in laughing]
You know, why don't we split the order? It's only fair.
Michael has been assigned six hours of mandatory counseling with a trained professional. I actually have a degree in social work. I mean, I know a lot of people would ask a few standard questions, and check off a few boxes, but I've got a chance to do some good here.
[stands outside church entrance] Okay, this is, all right, this is silly. [goes inside] [walks back out] Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope...
[Michael hands him a present] Wow, thanks, Michael, I...
Well, we still have to do the exit interview.
Yeah, Michael asked about it once. I just pretended not to hear him. He left.
Hi, Kevin. Look, I need to talk to you about-
Well the 'fun' is in it. [conference room group chimes agreement.]
It's not.  It's not.  Sit down or I am writing you up.
...about some other people engaging in PDA and, you know [Michael leans in closer to Toby] I just wanted to remind it's not appropriate to, to do that.
...feel like I may have glossed over a few...
Hey, this came with the Stamford book. [Sets down box that says: Personnel Files Stamford CT Office Confidential] Can you take care of it?
Does it have to be pizza? Could go for a, falafel?
You mean food truck. Ernesto's was a food truck.
We can play something more complicated if you like.
It was actually kind of hard to meet people I found.
I mean, what���s the end date? It must be really hard for her to sign on to be unhappy if she doesn���t know when it���s gonna end.
I prefer being stuck in a Costa Rican hospital.
What was fun about it for you?  Was it the death of the twins?
The lady cop acted like she'd never pulled someone over for driving too slow.  And I tried to get out of it with the famous Toby Flenderson 10,000 watt smile. [smiles] It didn't work.
Hey I left my glasses down here somewhere. Crossing through, beep beep. [Pam's plane hit Toby in the eye]
If you really want to have kids, I--- I guess you could somehow... foster parent, or something.
Let's just wait and see what happens. [whispers] You know?
Hey, hey what are- why are you doing this?
I don't report to you, Michael. I report to the head of HR in New York.
[to Darryl] Hey, you tricked me. You just wanted Kevin.
Hi, I'm uh, Toby Flenderson. I'm here to see George Howard Scubb.
Wish it were true, but it, it uh, seems from that photo that you took, you've entered into an intimate relationship.
You know, Michael, sometimes my daughter's stomach hurts when there's a mean girl at school...
I know people are only this excited to talk to me because of the trial. But, they talk to me for a while, and maybe people realize I have something to say. And then one day, we're just talking.
Hey I need to talk to you right now.
Corporate will be sending someone else to take my place for a while.
Come on Michael. Those are all fake stories.
You can't fire Pete. You understand why, right?
Oh, cool. It looks really interesting. What did you end up with? [Ryan pulls Creed's old coat out of a bag] Sorry.
Michael, can I talk to you for a uh, second please?
Yeah, the ball-throwing exercise is in the binder. It's in the section marked, 'Fun Ways To Make Brainstorming Sessions Explode With Excitement and Creativity.'
Hi, do you mind if I sign the card real quick?
Sunday church service... it's been a few years. The Big Guy and I, we got some catching up to do.
I can't talk about it or I'll get removed from the jury.
[Creed takes a bite of an apple] Creed is eating an apple.  I found a potato.
I can't believe this. [mistaking Darryl's sister for Darryl] Hey you, ass****!
Shortly after Kelly left, Ryan quit and also moved to Ohio, for what he claimed were unrelated reasons.
Uh, about a week. Er... .um... .maybe a month. I uh can't...
Thanks man! [awkwardly tries to hug Ryan, pats him on the back]
Every Halloween I tell him the same thing - You can't bring weapons into the office, and every year he says the same thing - As soon as I get my weapons back I'm gonna kill you. But there I am at Thanksgiving, alive, you know. I'm a lucky turkey.
But I-- I promised my daughter. Darryl, look-- I-- I need the doll, I need the doll.  I-- I'm-- I'm begging you.  I just-- I need it more than anything in this world.  I need this doll. Darryl, man I need this doll.
I love The Finer Things Club.  My ex-wife used to have a book club, and I would read their book and sometimes listen from the kitchen.
Hey, text from the old wife. Gonna take that. [runs outside]
I don't really play cards, but I'm not gonna lie to you. It felt really good to take money from Michael. Gonna chase that feeling.
Talk to Michael. I gave him the box.
That was the right decision for me and my marriage.
[unwraps present; present is a rock with a Post-It note rubber-banded to it; reads] 'Suck on this.'
[to Sasha] Okay, tell them what you wanted to say.
[fending Andy off] Oh, come on. Andy, no.
You know, sometimes I wish we just didn't have a conference room. [Kelly laughs] You know? He couldn't do that.
Ok, um, one thing that you're gonna want to look out for is carpal tunnel syndrome.  It's recommended that you take a ten minute break from typing every hour.  For your circulation, you're gonna want to get up out of your chairs and uh, and move around about ten minutes every hour.
Technically, I am in Human Resources. And Dwight was asking about human anatomy. Um... I'm just sad the public school system failed him so badly.
Hey, we're not all going to sit in a circle Indian style are we? [Laughing]
[gesturing to the rest of the office] This is everybody else... okay... This is the place... so thanks for the lift.
It's like if you write someone a letter, when you're really angry... they say to keep it in a drawer for a couple days. Then you just never end up sending it.
So this is H.R. This is your desk.
[to passing female pedestrian] Smile if you love men���s prostates.
Well, we did a little investigation and Dwight had a good point.  The ladder didn't reach the top shelf.  I don't know if I believe it, but I am a fan of the hardboiled detective novel.  [impression] I'll punch you in da mush, see.
Oh, this looks great. I'd, I'd love to be there, but my daughter's play is tonight. ... Damnit! You know, one of the other parents will probably videotape it.
I'd like you to imagine a place where you feel very peaceful. For me, it's the walk from the yogurt shop to my car after I drop my daughter off on Sunday afternoons.
Sure. Wow. [Michael throws a pen at his head] Ow...
Yeah, well... Not everybody has what we have.
...and you bounce it off the wall on your side of the tape.
This is a bloodbath. Alright, I���m calling this.
You know, I actually lived in Honolulu for a year.
Can���t. I took a course at the Weintraub Memory Academy. I sat next to this woman named Beverly Brook. She had a Greek salad for lunch. See what I mean?
I can neither confirm nor deny this. Let's just say I'll be up to my neck in jury duty. [excited outbursts]
Hey, really nice job in that meeting in there.
I always thought he might have been set up but I felt pressured to convict.
Hey Nellie. Mmm. I am so sick of February. It's the shortest month but it sure doesn't feel that way. We should catch up.
You know what Michael? You're right. You win. This is pointless. We're not getting anywhere. I got a bunch of fun stuff, in case my daughter ever comes over. Why don't we just run out the clock by playing games, drawing some pictures, talking?
You just got your corporate credit card back. Do you really want me to take it away again?
Didn't you lose a lot of money on that other investment, the one from the email?
Pete���s a pretty cool guy, though, and Andy was a terrible lover to Erin. He basically ignored her and left on a boat.
Well, you know how everyone fast forwards through ads these days? Well, what about an ad in slow motion. You know, if they fast forward through it, it'll just seem normal and it will catch your eye. Plus, uh, the slogan could be: Dunder Mifflin, we adapt to the pace of your business. [murmurs of approval by everyone but Michael]
This is fun. You know? I mean, this is fun.
[watch that Michael gave him beeps] Oh, some kind of... alarm.
Yeah, and I, uh, I think that the very fact that we're including it in our agenda frankly, is a big step forward.
I'd like to introduce you to my replacement.
Well, good.  We can, uh, throw that one out. [shuffles through papers]
Office relationships are never a good idea. Yeah. So let's just try to avoid them. But, um, if you already have one, you should disclose it to HR.
We should stay to maybe some more traditional models...
Well for a minute there, I saw myself selling my house, moving to Costa Rica, learning how to surf. But, Costa Rica will still be there. When I'm 65.
I heard about the hit.  Just-- make sure it's off company property, right?
Michael, I have one extra twin bed, if you want.
Casual Fridays are cancelled.  [everyone protests]  Let's just not do it anymore.
There's this female uh, uh, stenographer at the courthouse...
Well, I was in the Seminary for a year and dropped out 'cause I wanted to have sex with this girl, Cathy.  Followed her to Scranton.  Took the first job I could find in H.R.  Later she divorced me.  So no, I wouldn't say I have a passion for H.R.
Believe me, she has enough toys... she doesn't need your watch.
Well you know Michael, I have a brother in Boulder. Rory Flenderson. You should look him up.
Oh, Andy, we had this exact same conversation when you wanted to get rid of Nellie. You can't just get rid of people over grudges.
Michael, uh... we shouldn't be talking about this until all the decisions have been made.
There's a bunch of people back here, maybe...
Oh, no, no. no. My plane just got in. From New York. Are you still with Piotr?
Michael, do you have the name of the employee you're letting go? I'd like to start working on out-placement.
I know right?  I just want to go, and look at art, and swim in the Adriatic.
Well, I am trained in grief counseling, but, ahh, I don't think that's what they need right now.
Um, why don't you go ask him that?
Oh, wow, this is, uh, just a mystery novel that I've been working on.
There���s no shame in getting beaten up by a girl. My ex-wife used to demolish me.
Yeah, I guess it will be my, uh, thing in Costa Rica, be a nature photographer.
[singing and dancing] Dem bones, dem bones, dem tired bones, now we're the skeleton crew.
Hey... [sees both Jim and Pam] you two.
[to Phyllis and Stanley] What are you guys talking about? I have a daughter. How can I be a virgin?
[entering Andy's office] Knock, knock. Hey, Sasha's first year in the troops, so I'm selling cookies for her. Anyway, would you like some?
I don't really think people are in the laughing mood.
It's, uh... I was... might ask if you wanted...
Michael is like a movie on a plane.  You know, it's not great, but it's something to watch.  And when it's over you're like... how much time is left on this flight? Now what?
Toby, you are playing a dangerous game. Guess I'm through the gateway now, though, right?
I really disagree with this. I think it's kind of hateful. Though I am a little happy right now to have a platform to talk about the outcome of a case I was recently a juror on. The Scranton Strangler. That man's being put to death. I was part of the verdict, and I'm not so sure he's guilty any more. [Dwight plays a clip from the song Oh Yeah: Ohhhh yeah! Chica chicaaa]
I think these belong to you. [puts toys down on desk]
Well, as you know, Dwight has filed a lot of complaints against you over the years.
I was-- I was gonna get the doll.
Okay, I think we should probably be okay.
He- he can't do that.  Turns out she's allowed to have feelings of sexual arousal.  It doesn't become a violation until she physically acts on it.
This may be the first time that a male subordinate has attempted to get a modest scheduled raise by threatening to withhold sex from a female superior.  It will be a groundbreaking case when it inevitably goes to trial.
[spying at Darryl's house] Sounds like a EMDP-40.
No, they're clean.  I was going to wear them to volleyball practice later.
Well I just wanted to say I'm doing it. [Toby leaves]
I know, um, but Ryan thinks that, uh, they're not good enough.
You have to stop. [bangs on glass window]
It's just boiler plating, you don't have to read it.
Yes, that's true. I have never won a Dundie. I am more than okay  with that.
Okay, this isn���t over. Let���s stay focused, okay? ��We made fun of Andy earlier for getting beat up by a little girl, but... little things can be dangerous.
I like it just us three.  [very quietly] I don't want it to change.
[on speakerphone] Well you know, frankly a lot of us have been saying this for a long time.
I don't know, I just thought you could include me.
Oh, Michael, you can't ask about religious beliefs...
[hands Meredith his camera] This one right here.
All right, if you're having a relationship with your superior, you must disclose it.
To whomever, meaning us, the indirect object. Which is the correct usage of the word.
Um, ex-wife. Yeah. Um, her last name is 'Becker' now.
[nods] ...You know, I, uh, I know a little about what you're going through in a way. Um, when I was a kid, my parents got divorced. They both wanted custody, and they both asked me to testify against the other one in court. So, I don't know, I didn't want them getting divorced in the first place you know? I loved them both so much. I just wanted... [Michael pushes Toby's food tray off the table and walks off]
Erin, HR is a joke. I can't do anything about anything.
Oh, hey, Bert. Wanna see the dance? Dem bones, dem bones, dem dry...
Guys. Really, it's ok. Everyone has made a really solid first impression, I don't think there's any reason for anybody to worry.
Yeah, uh, she'll be starting next week. If you have any questions about the transition, just let me know.
Yeah, it just means whoever complained came to me later and withdrew it, so I took their name off.
Ok, I can't count the hour if you don't talk.
How will your experience selling refinery equipment translate to our smaller scale here?
These things just have a way of working themselves out.
Oscar says I checked out huh?  Huh. [nods head]
I'm gonna really miss going to beers with you guys every Tuesday night [Pam holds up soda in salute, Meredith yells 'yeah!', Michael looks at camera] and lastly, I'd love to urge you to keep up with my fight to have the building checked for radon gas.  You know, it's a, it's a real serious matter, and every time I try to have the, uh...
If I won the lottery, I don't know. I don't think I'd make any changes to my life. Quit my job, move, meet someone....
Guys, it's a really big deal. [rubs his neck]
The Scranton strangler. George Howard Skub. Haven't I told you about the jury I was on a couple years ago?
Angela, what do you want me to do?
[answering phone] This is Toby. Hey Pam. Where are you calling from?
It's a dead animal in an office. You can't...
Well, I really can't talk about it, but it's a very high profile case.
Alright, just know that you're not in the Finer Things Club.
Uh, no, the opposite. I was actually selected to be a juror on a very high-profile case.
You filled them in and faxed them yourself!
You know this sounds a lot like the premise of my latest Chad Flendermen novel. A murder for framing.
I'm just saying I don't think it's appropriate for you to have given Ryan that award.
Actually, I didn't think it was appropriate to invite children since it's... You know, there's gambling and alcohol, and it's in our dangerous warehouse and it's a school night... And, you know, Hooters is catering. You know, is that enough? Should I keep going?
Alright, it's getting gooier so we'll just do it later.
Well, it's one of my strengths, but it's the manager's job.
Every Friday at 4, I have a standing appointment with Dwight for him to file a grievance against Jim. I tell him that I'm sending them to a special file in New York. That box is the special file in New York.
