See this? You have to take the time to talk to your children about their feelings. What else are you feeling, Eric?
I'm serious. Let's put down the video game and go to the kitchen.
It's time for Nanny Stella to show Eric Cartman his ways are not going to be tolerated anymore! 
Eric, you need to listen to me.  This is very important. I am getting down to eye level with Eric so that I can talk to him on his level.  Eric, you need to understand why you are being punished. All right?
Come on.  This video game is going right here on the counter until we've done some chores. Now, first thing we're going to do is make your bed.  Eric, no! This is not acceptable! 
Right. Then I'm going to have to take it. 
All right, that's it!  You're going to time-out! 
Is this about more than your video game? Are you feeling angry at me because you think I'm here to change your life?
Whenever you are naughty, Eric, you are going to sit on this stool for five minutes.
All right! I've dealt with this before! We just need to use psychology on him!
Well then, I'll just have to stand right here!  Oh!  He spit in my mouth!
Me? Well, it's because I love children, like you.
Eric, can I just talk to you for a quick second? Why are you so angry?
Why you, you...  you little bastard! How dare you?!
It's the time-out stool. You can't get down until the time is up.
And you're feeling like I have no right to come in and tell you how to live.
