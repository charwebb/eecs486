Eric, you need to listen to me.  This is very important. I am getting down to eye level with Eric so that I can talk to him on his level.  Eric, you need to understand why you are being punished. All right?
Me? Well, it's because I love children, like you.
Eric, can I just talk to you for a quick second? Why are you so angry?
It's the time-out stool. You can't get down until the time is up.
All right, that's it!  You're going to time-out! 
Come on.  This video game is going right here on the counter until we've done some chores. Now, first thing we're going to do is make your bed.  Eric, no! This is not acceptable! 
Is this about more than your video game? Are you feeling angry at me because you think I'm here to change your life?
I'm serious. Let's put down the video game and go to the kitchen.
See this? You have to take the time to talk to your children about their feelings. What else are you feeling, Eric?
Right. Then I'm going to have to take it. 
All right! I've dealt with this before! We just need to use psychology on him!
Hold on, Mrs. Cartman. There are going to be some rule changes around here, Eric. First of all, no video games until chores are done.
Whenever you are naughty, Eric, you are going to sit on this stool for five minutes.
Well then, I'll just have to stand right here!  Oh!  He spit in my mouth!
And you're feeling like I have no right to come in and tell you how to live.
Why you, you...  you little bastard! How dare you?!
