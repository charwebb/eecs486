Well, well, what are doing out here?  You shouldn't be out walking the streets. 

Stolen? You kids told me you won that whale at Pizza Hut!

Haha, very funny, kid. Sit down and stop playing games.

Would you like a ride into town? I'm on my way to Master Thomas Jefferson's hosue to get a very important document, I am.

Just hang with us for a bit. We'll fill you in on everything you haven't been told. 

Glad I picked you up, kid. It's dangerous for someone your age to be hitchhikin'

Hey! They just found the cure for AIDS! You just have to inject yourself with all your cash! Woohoo!

You're gonna have to talk to the higher-ups.

Yeah? Well my job is to tow this bike. You want it back? You talk to the county. 

Oh, goodness! We must have run over a little Mexican further up north. Is it okay? 

Please, I just need to know if this is "South Park"?

We just spent our first semester at college. Our professors opened our eyes. The government is using its corporate ties to make you sell magazines so they can get rich.

Sorry kid, we've got orders from corporate headquarters.

Yeah. You like making fun of minorities, "nigger" guy? Huh we don't take kindly to social ignorance.

Ow! Oo-uhow! Ow! Hey, man, what are you doing?! Ow, stop it!

Here we are, the end of the road. Alamosa Maximum Security Juvenile Hall.

You didn't like The Passion? But it shows how Christ suffered for you. Mel Gibson is a very spiritual man. 

Well, hopefully spending some time with you, gorgeous. Is $20 enough?

Oh Jesus, there's a little boy on the track. 

Sorry. Only the official messenger boy is allowed to talk to Mister Jefferson

Hang on, we'll be back at camp in a matter of no time. 

I haven't had the time to thank you, for doing what you've d- 

Michael Richards? Huh well, son of a bitch!

We are now entering Ensenada, the second largest city on the Mexican Baja Peninsula.  We have now traveled over 2000 miles since leaving New York City. We'll just be stopping here for a few moments for gas, and then our tour will continue onto its final destination. 

Come on, Skeeter.  These "nigger" guys ain't worth our trouble.

Hey, wait a minute. You're just a kid!

Well, so my idea was this: Let's have like a week long music festival, draw everyone here, and then together, we can tear it all down.  Whoa, what the hell?! 

Thar look Skeeter! That's that guy from the TV!

Alrighty, do you want this kind or this kind? 

It's pronounced "hoarder," young man, and if you are you should talk to the school counselor about it! 

Can I interest you in some ice cream?

You kids just haven't been to college yet. But just you wait, this thing is about to get HUGE.

There there now, let's just get you back home, shall we?

Bentonville, Arkansas. That's where Wall-Mart started, that's where all the bigwigs are. 

'Scuse me, is this the right road to Breckenridge.

Oh wow, you guys shouldn't be doing that. Don't you know what you're doing to the world?

Yeah, I like to be a part of the solution and not part of the problem. Well, anyway,  good for you!

We have to kill him, before he infects everyone else!

Here we are, then. The current residence of Master Thomas Jefferson.

Never seen you around here, friend. Might you be from up North?

Wow, this band is so crunchy. Dude, I need more weed.

Wow, my friend Brittany was right. This is a really laid-back place.

You see, the corporations take their profits and invest it in the war machine while keeping everyone blind.

Well what is this? A "nigger" guy convention? 

Aw... Aw yeah. Oh man oh... Ohh! Aw-aw-AWWW-aw. AW-aw. Oh, s-sorry I was so quick.
