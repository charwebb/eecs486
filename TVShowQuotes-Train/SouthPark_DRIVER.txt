What?!

Alrighty, do you want this kind or this kind? 

This year? Why it's 1776, it is.

Ow! Oo-uhow! Ow! Hey, man, what are you doing?! Ow, stop it!

What the hell are you doing, Kid?!

There there now, let's just get you back home, shall we?

Well, here's fifty for the gas.  Adios.

Wow, this band is so crunchy. Dude, I need more weed.

What if he attacks us first?

Oh Jesus, there's a little boy on the track. 

Can I interest you in some ice cream?

You damn kids!

You damn kids!

Oh, goodness! We must have run over a little Mexican further up north. Is it okay? 

Hey! That's Mel Gibson!

I'm going as fast as I can.

We are now entering Ensenada, the second largest city on the Mexican Baja Peninsula.  We have now traveled over 2000 miles since leaving New York City. We'll just be stopping here for a few moments for gas, and then our tour will continue onto its final destination. 

We've reached the rally site, Hildog.

Yeah? Well my job is to tow this bike. You want it back? You talk to the county. 

Aw... Aw yeah. Oh man oh... Ohh! Aw-aw-AWWW-aw. AW-aw. Oh, s-sorry I was so quick.

We just spent our first semester at college. Our professors opened our eyes. The government is using its corporate ties to make you sell magazines so they can get rich.

Well, well, what are doing out here?  You shouldn't be out walking the streets. 

Sorry. Only the official messenger boy is allowed to talk to Mister Jefferson

Glad I picked you up, kid. It's dangerous for someone your age to be hitchhikin'

'Kay. What's stuck to the bottom of the bus? 

Hi there, little lady.

Bentonville, Arkansas. That's where Wall-Mart started, that's where all the bigwigs are. 

It's pronounced "hoarder," young man, and if you are you should talk to the school counselor about it! 

Oh my God! Oh my God!

Hang on, we'll be back at camp in a matter of no time. 

Well, so my idea was this: Let's have like a week long music festival, draw everyone here, and then together, we can tear it all down.  Whoa, what the hell?! 

'Scuse me, is this the right road to Breckenridge.

What the hell is goin' on?!

Hey, is that a hybrid?

What's going on?!

Sorry kid, we've got orders from corporate headquarters.

Hey, wait a minute. You're just a kid!

Just hang with us for a bit. We'll fill you in on everything you haven't been told. 

Please! We're running out of time!

Hey! They just found the cure for AIDS! You just have to inject yourself with all your cash! Woohoo!

Would you like a ride into town? I'm on my way to Master Thomas Jefferson's hosue to get a very important document, I am.

What? Oh-oh-uh, is this a bust?

Huuh? 

You kids just haven't been to college yet. But just you wait, this thing is about to get HUGE.

You goin' to Washington to visit family?

Yes, ma'am. Where to?

We didn't listen!

Who was that?

Thar look Skeeter! That's that guy from the TV!

You're gonna have to talk to the higher-ups.

Well, what the hell does he want?!

Yes!

Here we are, then. The current residence of Master Thomas Jefferson.

Never seen you around here, friend. Might you be from up North?

Here we are, the end of the road. Alamosa Maximum Security Juvenile Hall.

No, the plane crashed. We're in the Colorado mountains somewhere.  Matt? Matt?!  My husband. He said the outbreak was all over the news, but everything was totally fine where he was.

Oh shit! 

I haven't had the time to thank you, for doing what you've d- 

Well, hopefully spending some time with you, gorgeous. Is $20 enough?

A flashback? Why, what is that?

An airport?! But...?

Yeah. You like making fun of minorities, "nigger" guy? Huh we don't take kindly to social ignorance.

This your bike?

Awhuh! What?!

Yes, let him think!

Worthy young lad, are you all right?

Please, please hurry! It's important!

Look, I didn't know nothin' about this.

You didn't like The Passion? But it shows how Christ suffered for you. Mel Gibson is a very spiritual man. 

Aww- get in. 

What's that noise, officer? 

You'd better watch yourself next time, abandoner! 

Oh wow, you guys shouldn't be doing that. Don't you know what you're doing to the world?

Yeah, I like to be a part of the solution and not part of the problem. Well, anyway,  good for you!

Ha... how much are you charging?

Haha, very funny, kid. Sit down and stop playing games.

Huh?

What are we going to do?

Yes!

I'm afraid you'll have to wait here.

Stolen? You kids told me you won that whale at Pizza Hut!

We have to kill him, before he infects everyone else!

Michael Richards? Huh well, son of a bitch!

What?! What is it, please?! Hurry, my husband might still be alive!

You see, the corporations take their profits and invest it in the war machine while keeping everyone blind.

Please, I just need to know if this is "South Park"?
