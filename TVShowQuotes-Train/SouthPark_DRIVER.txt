Thar look Skeeter! That's that guy from the TV!

Yes, let him think!

We didn't listen!

Here we are, then. The current residence of Master Thomas Jefferson.

Oh, goodness! We must have run over a little Mexican further up north. Is it okay? 

Yes!

Well, well, what are doing out here?  You shouldn't be out walking the streets. 

I haven't had the time to thank you, for doing what you've d- 

Huh?

'Kay. What's stuck to the bottom of the bus? 

Hey, wait a minute. You're just a kid!

Bentonville, Arkansas. That's where Wall-Mart started, that's where all the bigwigs are. 

You kids just haven't been to college yet. But just you wait, this thing is about to get HUGE.

You damn kids!

Yes, ma'am. Where to?

What?! What is it, please?! Hurry, my husband might still be alive!

We just spent our first semester at college. Our professors opened our eyes. The government is using its corporate ties to make you sell magazines so they can get rich.

What if he attacks us first?

Ha... how much are you charging?

We've reached the rally site, Hildog.

Come on, Skeeter.  These "nigger" guys ain't worth our trouble.

Yeah? Well my job is to tow this bike. You want it back? You talk to the county. 

Oh my God! Oh my God!

Oh Jesus, there's a little boy on the track. 

This your bike?

What? Oh-oh-uh, is this a bust?

Alrighty, do you want this kind or this kind? 

Oh wow, you guys shouldn't be doing that. Don't you know what you're doing to the world?

We are now entering Ensenada, the second largest city on the Mexican Baja Peninsula.  We have now traveled over 2000 miles since leaving New York City. We'll just be stopping here for a few moments for gas, and then our tour will continue onto its final destination. 

Haha, very funny, kid. Sit down and stop playing games.

Yes!

I'm going as fast as I can.

Hi there, little lady.

Hey! That's Mel Gibson!

Well, so my idea was this: Let's have like a week long music festival, draw everyone here, and then together, we can tear it all down.  Whoa, what the hell?! 

Hey, is that a hybrid?

What's going on?!

Please! We're running out of time!

A flashback? Why, what is that?

Oh yeah, level four, sweet!

You see, the corporations take their profits and invest it in the war machine while keeping everyone blind.

You goin' to Washington to visit family?

What the hell are you doing, Kid?!

Ok-okay. 

Who was that?

This year? Why it's 1776, it is.

Please, please hurry! It's important!

'Scuse me, is this the right road to Breckenridge.

Stolen? You kids told me you won that whale at Pizza Hut!

Glad I picked you up, kid. It's dangerous for someone your age to be hitchhikin'

Well, here's fifty for the gas.  Adios.

Look, I didn't know nothin' about this.

Oh shit! 

You didn't like The Passion? But it shows how Christ suffered for you. Mel Gibson is a very spiritual man. 

Sorry kid, we've got orders from corporate headquarters.

Yeah. You like making fun of minorities, "nigger" guy? Huh we don't take kindly to social ignorance.

Here we are, the end of the road. Alamosa Maximum Security Juvenile Hall.

Michael Richards? Huh well, son of a bitch!

Aw... Aw yeah. Oh man oh... Ohh! Aw-aw-AWWW-aw. AW-aw. Oh, s-sorry I was so quick.

What the hell is goin' on?!

Well, what the hell does he want?!

Yeah, I like to be a part of the solution and not part of the problem. Well, anyway,  good for you!

Can I interest you in some ice cream?

I'm afraid you'll have to wait here.

There there now, let's just get you back home, shall we?

Worthy young lad, are you all right?

Hey!Â 

What are we going to do?

Certified letter for the rock band MOOP?

Hang on, we'll be back at camp in a matter of no time. 

What?!

What the hell?

Wow, this band is so crunchy. Dude, I need more weed.

What's that noise, officer? 

It's pronounced "hoarder," young man, and if you are you should talk to the school counselor about it! 

No, the plane crashed. We're in the Colorado mountains somewhere.  Matt? Matt?!  My husband. He said the outbreak was all over the news, but everything was totally fine where he was.

It's on the impound list. You owe the county for tickets. 

Please, I just need to know if this is "South Park"?

Huuh? 

We have to kill him, before he infects everyone else!

Well what is this? A "nigger" guy convention? 

You damn kids!

Well, hopefully spending some time with you, gorgeous. Is $20 enough?

Sorry. Only the official messenger boy is allowed to talk to Mister Jefferson

Wow, my friend Brittany was right. This is a really laid-back place.

Aww- get in.
