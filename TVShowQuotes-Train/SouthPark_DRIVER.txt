We are now entering Ensenada, the second largest city on the Mexican Baja Peninsula.  We have now traveled over 2000 miles since leaving New York City. We'll just be stopping here for a few moments for gas, and then our tour will continue onto its final destination. 
Come on, Skeeter.  These "nigger" guys ain't worth our trouble.
We just spent our first semester at college. Our professors opened our eyes. The government is using its corporate ties to make you sell magazines so they can get rich.
Wow, my friend Brittany was right. This is a really laid-back place.
Bentonville, Arkansas. That's where Wall-Mart started, that's where all the bigwigs are. 
Here we are, then. The current residence of Master Thomas Jefferson.
You didn't like The Passion? But it shows how Christ suffered for you. Mel Gibson is a very spiritual man. 
Stolen? You kids told me you won that whale at Pizza Hut!
You see, the corporations take their profits and invest it in the war machine while keeping everyone blind.
Ow! Oo-uhow! Ow! Hey, man, what are you doing?! Ow, stop it!
It's pronounced "hoarder," young man, and if you are you should talk to the school counselor about it! 
Well, hopefully spending some time with you, gorgeous. Is $20 enough?
Never seen you around here, friend. Might you be from up North?
Glad I picked you up, kid. It's dangerous for someone your age to be hitchhikin'
Hey! They just found the cure for AIDS! You just have to inject yourself with all your cash! Woohoo!
Well what is this? A "nigger" guy convention? 
It's on the impound list. You owe the county for tickets. 
Oh, goodness! We must have run over a little Mexican further up north. Is it okay? 
Just hang with us for a bit. We'll fill you in on everything you haven't been told. 
Here we are, the end of the road. Alamosa Maximum Security Juvenile Hall.
Sorry kid, we've got orders from corporate headquarters.
Haha, very funny, kid. Sit down and stop playing games.
Sorry. Only the official messenger boy is allowed to talk to Mister Jefferson
Wow, this band is so crunchy. Dude, I need more weed.
We have to kill him, before he infects everyone else!
No, the plane crashed. We're in the Colorado mountains somewhere.  Matt? Matt?!  My husband. He said the outbreak was all over the news, but everything was totally fine where he was.
Can I interest you in some ice cream?
You're gonna have to talk to the higher-ups.
Well, so my idea was this: Let's have like a week long music festival, draw everyone here, and then together, we can tear it all down.  Whoa, what the hell?! 
Hey, wait a minute. You're just a kid!
Aw... Aw yeah. Oh man oh... Ohh! Aw-aw-AWWW-aw. AW-aw. Oh, s-sorry I was so quick.
Yeah. You like making fun of minorities, "nigger" guy? Huh we don't take kindly to social ignorance.
Oh Jesus, there's a little boy on the track. 
Please, I just need to know if this is "South Park"?
Thar look Skeeter! That's that guy from the TV!
You kids just haven't been to college yet. But just you wait, this thing is about to get HUGE.
'Kay. What's stuck to the bottom of the bus? 
Oh wow, you guys shouldn't be doing that. Don't you know what you're doing to the world?
Hang on, we'll be back at camp in a matter of no time. 
Yeah? Well my job is to tow this bike. You want it back? You talk to the county. 
Would you like a ride into town? I'm on my way to Master Thomas Jefferson's hosue to get a very important document, I am.
Well, well, what are doing out here?  You shouldn't be out walking the streets. 
'Scuse me, is this the right road to Breckenridge.
Michael Richards? Huh well, son of a bitch!
There there now, let's just get you back home, shall we?
