Well, hopefully spending some time with you, gorgeous. Is $20 enough?
Here we are, the end of the road. Alamosa Maximum Security Juvenile Hall.
It's on the impound list. You owe the county for tickets. 
Michael Richards? Huh well, son of a bitch!
It's pronounced "hoarder," young man, and if you are you should talk to the school counselor about it! 
You see, the corporations take their profits and invest it in the war machine while keeping everyone blind.
'Kay. What's stuck to the bottom of the bus? 
I haven't had the time to thank you, for doing what you've d- 
Here we are, then. The current residence of Master Thomas Jefferson.
Well, well, what are doing out here?  You shouldn't be out walking the streets. 
Well what is this? A "nigger" guy convention? 
No, the plane crashed. We're in the Colorado mountains somewhere.  Matt? Matt?!  My husband. He said the outbreak was all over the news, but everything was totally fine where he was.
Come on, Skeeter.  These "nigger" guys ain't worth our trouble.
Ow! Oo-uhow! Ow! Hey, man, what are you doing?! Ow, stop it!
Alrighty, do you want this kind or this kind? 
We are now entering Ensenada, the second largest city on the Mexican Baja Peninsula.  We have now traveled over 2000 miles since leaving New York City. We'll just be stopping here for a few moments for gas, and then our tour will continue onto its final destination. 
You didn't like The Passion? But it shows how Christ suffered for you. Mel Gibson is a very spiritual man. 
Haha, very funny, kid. Sit down and stop playing games.
Stolen? You kids told me you won that whale at Pizza Hut!
Hang on, we'll be back at camp in a matter of no time. 
You kids just haven't been to college yet. But just you wait, this thing is about to get HUGE.
We just spent our first semester at college. Our professors opened our eyes. The government is using its corporate ties to make you sell magazines so they can get rich.
Please, I just need to know if this is "South Park"?
Yeah, I like to be a part of the solution and not part of the problem. Well, anyway,  good for you!
Sorry kid, we've got orders from corporate headquarters.
Well, so my idea was this: Let's have like a week long music festival, draw everyone here, and then together, we can tear it all down.  Whoa, what the hell?! 
Sorry. Only the official messenger boy is allowed to talk to Mister Jefferson
Can I interest you in some ice cream?
Aw... Aw yeah. Oh man oh... Ohh! Aw-aw-AWWW-aw. AW-aw. Oh, s-sorry I was so quick.
Just hang with us for a bit. We'll fill you in on everything you haven't been told. 
Hey! They just found the cure for AIDS! You just have to inject yourself with all your cash! Woohoo!
Never seen you around here, friend. Might you be from up North?
Wow, my friend Brittany was right. This is a really laid-back place.
Yeah? Well my job is to tow this bike. You want it back? You talk to the county. 
Hey, wait a minute. You're just a kid!
Bentonville, Arkansas. That's where Wall-Mart started, that's where all the bigwigs are. 
'Scuse me, is this the right road to Breckenridge.
What?! What is it, please?! Hurry, my husband might still be alive!
There there now, let's just get you back home, shall we?
Oh wow, you guys shouldn't be doing that. Don't you know what you're doing to the world?
Thar look Skeeter! That's that guy from the TV!
Oh, goodness! We must have run over a little Mexican further up north. Is it okay? 
Would you like a ride into town? I'm on my way to Master Thomas Jefferson's hosue to get a very important document, I am.
We have to kill him, before he infects everyone else!
Wow, this band is so crunchy. Dude, I need more weed.
