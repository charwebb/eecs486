And it was Texas who sent them to us! People in San Antonio got rid of their homeless by tellin' them what a great place Evergreen was!
It's just vulgar and stupid, you know? Music used to be good.
What is your problem? Get lost, little Eichmann. 
That's right! We know whose fault this is!
Nnoo, Harvey Fierstein's just gay and fat, honey. He's not green.
I know what I may like. I don't like marching
He's going to speak with us once again!
Oh hey Stan, I'm your friend Brian through your uncle Jimbo? Hey I commented on your status but I haven't heard back from you. Could you give me a poke sometime soon?
Well, like the rest of you, I am shocked and appalled at what happened! I don't know if the parents are to blame or if it's the times we're living in, but something has to change!
I think if more people saw The Passion they'd have faith in Jesus.
Boy I tell you what, it is raining cats and dogs outside. Mostly cats.  I just wish I had brought an umbrella.
Cartman? Eric Cartman? The kid who jumped thirty homeless people on a skateboard?
You're playing into the corporate game! See, the corporations are trying to turn you into little Eichmann's so that they can make money. 
Hey!  Don't put your beliefs on me, buddy!
Uh, waitress, a-a-actually, I ordered the chicken soup. This is minnestrone.
Yeah man, the corporations. Right now they're raping the world for money!
They just pushed us onto airplanes and said we weren't welcome anymore!
You know what would be better for me is Saturday afternoon.
Uh, he was dressed mostly in black with a kind of... cloak.
Yeah? Well that makes you homeless, so get out of here before you die!
I'm Agent Sharp and this is Agent Keen. We're with  the FBI.
The incredibly fat and gay skinny straight man?
Oh, what are you supposed to be? Oh  oh, right. You're supposed to be that um... uhhh... 
I'm a really sad panda. I didn't know we were doing all that damage. This is all that damn lawyer's fault! 
It's a musical thing. Women are so caught up in all the singing and dancing they don't even notice it but, there's a blowjob reference almost every ten seconds. Broadway writers call it "subtext." Just listen really, really closely.
You fuck your son and you won't even give him a kiss? Booooooo!
Oh, it'll happen, don't worry. Right now your wife is being shot so full of subliminal messages, all she'll be thinking about afterwards is "blowjob."
This is bullcrap! I ain't standin' for this!
Yeah, uh I've done it a few times.
I'll take twenty lemon bars, you little rascals.
Yeah, we'll have one guy who like, who like, makes bread. A-and one guy who like, l-looks out for other people's safety.
We must respect the wishes of people's BFFs. Otherwise, all our BFF necklaces would become meaningless
If we all put our heads together, we can find them!
Oh wuhow! Look honey, it's Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, and Bruce Vilanch. 
You die, pigs!  You want to die, huh? 
That's far enough! Just march your butts right back out of our town!
Oh, so this is what it was like. 
Right right, the incredibly Chaz Bono. Remember honey? Dancing with the Stars? The fat transsexual?
Hello, are you folks holding this Passion meeting?
The plagues! The plagues are upon us! Run!
I love Chipotle. But getting all the bloodstains out of my underwear is a nightmare. 
Well, I, I think whoever took the head was... really just doing an homage to the Simpsons.  Heh, I think it's great.
