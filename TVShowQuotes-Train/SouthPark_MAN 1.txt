You know what would be better for me is Saturday afternoon.
I'll take twenty lemon bars, you little rascals.
What is your problem? Get lost, little Eichmann. 
I love Chipotle. But getting all the bloodstains out of my underwear is a nightmare. 
I'm Agent Sharp and this is Agent Keen. We're with  the FBI.
It's a musical thing. Women are so caught up in all the singing and dancing they don't even notice it but, there's a blowjob reference almost every ten seconds. Broadway writers call it "subtext." Just listen really, really closely.
That's right! We know whose fault this is!
Right right, the incredibly Chaz Bono. Remember honey? Dancing with the Stars? The fat transsexual?
Yeah, uh I've done it a few times.
Hey!  Don't put your beliefs on me, buddy!
The plagues! The plagues are upon us! Run!
Yeah? Well that makes you homeless, so get out of here before you die!
This is bullcrap! I ain't standin' for this!
Nnoo, Harvey Fierstein's just gay and fat, honey. He's not green.
Well, like the rest of you, I am shocked and appalled at what happened! I don't know if the parents are to blame or if it's the times we're living in, but something has to change!
They just pushed us onto airplanes and said we weren't welcome anymore!
He's going to speak with us once again!
You fuck your son and you won't even give him a kiss? Booooooo!
Oh, it'll happen, don't worry. Right now your wife is being shot so full of subliminal messages, all she'll be thinking about afterwards is "blowjob."
Uh, he was dressed mostly in black with a kind of... cloak.
Hello, are you folks holding this Passion meeting?
That's far enough! Just march your butts right back out of our town!
And it was Texas who sent them to us! People in San Antonio got rid of their homeless by tellin' them what a great place Evergreen was!
The homeless first started arriving in Evergreen about three months ago. At first there were only a few of them, askin' for change, sleeping in the parks. But then more showed up, and we realized there was somethin' different about them. They fed off of our change to the point that they could actually start renting apartments. We knew it wouldn't be long before the homeless actually started buying homes. And then we'd have no idea who was homeless and who wasn't! The people living in the house right next door to you could be homeless and you wouldn't even know!  Nobody could trust anybody! Fights broke out. War!  That's when I started suspecting that  my own wife, who I'd been living with for twenty years, was actually homeless. So I had to burn her. In her bed while she slept.  After she died I vowed I wouldn't let the homeless destroy our town! So we came up with a plan to get rid of them once and for all. 
Yeah, we'll have one guy who like, who like, makes bread. A-and one guy who like, l-looks out for other people's safety.
Oh wuhow! Look honey, it's Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, and Bruce Vilanch. 
The incredibly fat and gay skinny straight man?
You die, pigs!  You want to die, huh? 
Cartman? Eric Cartman? The kid who jumped thirty homeless people on a skateboard?
Oh hey Stan, I'm your friend Brian through your uncle Jimbo? Hey I commented on your status but I haven't heard back from you. Could you give me a poke sometime soon?
Oh, what are you supposed to be? Oh  oh, right. You're supposed to be that um... uhhh... 
It's just vulgar and stupid, you know? Music used to be good.
Oh man, I can't wait to see the look on those little Eichmann's faces when they hear this crunchy groove. 
You're playing into the corporate game! See, the corporations are trying to turn you into little Eichmann's so that they can make money. 
Boy I tell you what, it is raining cats and dogs outside. Mostly cats.  I just wish I had brought an umbrella.
Uh, waitress, a-a-actually, I ordered the chicken soup. This is minnestrone.
We must respect the wishes of people's BFFs. Otherwise, all our BFF necklaces would become meaningless
Wait, wait, there's a star above the stage.  That's very offensive to non-Christians.
Oh, so this is what it was like. 
Well, I, I think whoever took the head was... really just doing an homage to the Simpsons.  Heh, I think it's great.
Yeah man, the corporations. Right now they're raping the world for money!
Well I guess we could change the law to allow for medicinal marijuana to be sold just outside the door of the shop.
