M-mm-m. Not really.

You just took one last week, silly.

Oh man, I can't wait to see the look on those little Eichmann's faces when they hear this crunchy groove. 

Raah!

That is some weird shit. 

The homeless first started arriving in Evergreen about three months ago. At first there were only a few of them, askin' for change, sleeping in the parks. But then more showed up, and we realized there was somethin' different about them. They fed off of our change to the point that they could actually start renting apartments. We knew it wouldn't be long before the homeless actually started buying homes. And then we'd have no idea who was homeless and who wasn't! The people living in the house right next door to you could be homeless and you wouldn't even know!  Nobody could trust anybody! Fights broke out. War!  That's when I started suspecting that  my own wife, who I'd been living with for twenty years, was actually homeless. So I had to burn her. In her bed while she slept.  After she died I vowed I wouldn't let the homeless destroy our town! So we came up with a plan to get rid of them once and for all. 

All right!

Our imagination?

Who's next to take a shower?

I'll take twenty lemon bars, you little rascals.

Yeah? Well that makes you homeless, so get out of here before you die!

You're playing into the corporate game! See, the corporations are trying to turn you into little Eichmann's so that they can make money. 

Boy I tell you what, it is raining cats and dogs outside. Mostly cats.  I just wish I had brought an umbrella.

And it was Texas who sent them to us! People in San Antonio got rid of their homeless by tellin' them what a great place Evergreen was!

This is inhumane.

Wait, wait, there's a star above the stage.  That's very offensive to non-Christians.

Hello, are you folks holding this Passion meeting?

Yeah.

My name's Bill, and Im an alcoholic.

Well, I, I think whoever took the head was... really just doing an homage to the Simpsons.  Heh, I think it's great.

This is bullcrap! I ain't standin' for this!

It's pee! 

Do it again!

You know what would be better for me is Saturday afternoon.

Oh wuhow! Look honey, it's Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, and Bruce Vilanch. 

It's George Bush's fault!

Yes. Yeh-yes she did.

Oh, it'll happen, don't worry. Right now your wife is being shot so full of subliminal messages, all she'll be thinking about afterwards is "blowjob."

Here! Hey kid, grab this stick! 

Enjoying the show?

They did it! They killed him! 

Huh?

Yeah, we'll have one guy who like, who like, makes bread. A-and one guy who like, l-looks out for other people's safety.

Duhude, that handicapped dude ruhules!

The incredibly fat and gay skinny straight man?

I love Chipotle. But getting all the bloodstains out of my underwear is a nightmare. 

Uh, waitress, a-a-actually, I ordered the chicken soup. This is minnestrone.

I'm Agent Sharp and this is Agent Keen. We're with  the FBI.

Mary was my mother!

Uh, he was dressed mostly in black with a kind of... cloak.

Oho! Yeah!

It's burning Man!

That's right!

Well, like the rest of you, I am shocked and appalled at what happened! I don't know if the parents are to blame or if it's the times we're living in, but something has to change!

Fuck you, bitch! 

Oh, what are you supposed to be? Oh  oh, right. You're supposed to be that um... uhhh... 

Wow, that's such cultural music.

Counselor Mackey?

That's far enough! Just march your butts right back out of our town!

Awww.

They just pushed us onto airplanes and said we weren't welcome anymore!

It's a musical thing. Women are so caught up in all the singing and dancing they don't even notice it but, there's a blowjob reference almost every ten seconds. Broadway writers call it "subtext." Just listen really, really closely.

Cartman? Eric Cartman? The kid who jumped thirty homeless people on a skateboard?

Let's bail on this whole angry scene. 

He's going to speak with us once again!

Change my bet!

Oh my God, I found a penny! 

Yeah! 

Yeah.

That's right, yes.

No?

He's right.

Come on, Kobe, let's just go.

You fuck your son and you won't even give him a kiss? Booooooo!

You mean, during the ball game?

Oy, look up there! 

I know what I may like. I don't like marching

Oh no!

Nice.

Nnoo, Harvey Fierstein's just gay and fat, honey. He's not green.

What is your problem? Get lost, little Eichmann. 

Ooo, free-range aspirin!

Whaaaaat's haaappeniiiiing?!

If we all put our heads together, we can find them!

Poor kid.

Oh hey Stan, I'm your friend Brian through your uncle Jimbo? Hey I commented on your status but I haven't heard back from you. Could you give me a poke sometime soon?

Oh, so this is what it was like. 

Yeah, uh I've done it a few times.

Yeah man, the corporations. Right now they're raping the world for money!

It's just vulgar and stupid, you know? Music used to be good.

Come on, everybody!

Nobody takes us Canadians seriousleh!

Hey!  Don't put your beliefs on me, buddy!

Right right, the incredibly Chaz Bono. Remember honey? Dancing with the Stars? The fat transsexual?

I'm a really sad panda. I didn't know we were doing all that damage. This is all that damn lawyer's fault! 

Hey!

Ms. Lopez! Up here!

Hello.

Somebody stop it!

Right. But we survived.

He is so courageous.
