They just pushed us onto airplanes and said we weren't welcome anymore!

Well, I, I think whoever took the head was... really just doing an homage to the Simpsons.  Heh, I think it's great.

The plagues! The plagues are upon us! Run!

Oh wuhow! Look honey, it's Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, and Bruce Vilanch. 

This is bullcrap! I ain't standin' for this!

It's just vulgar and stupid, you know? Music used to be good.

I know what I may like. I don't like marching

He's going to speak with us once again!

I think if more people saw The Passion they'd have faith in Jesus.

I'm Agent Sharp and this is Agent Keen. We're with  the FBI.

Right right, the incredibly Chaz Bono. Remember honey? Dancing with the Stars? The fat transsexual?

Wait, wait, there's a star above the stage.  That's very offensive to non-Christians.

Hey!  Don't put your beliefs on me, buddy!

Uh, he was dressed mostly in black with a kind of... cloak.

Oh man, I can't wait to see the look on those little Eichmann's faces when they hear this crunchy groove. 

Nnoo, Harvey Fierstein's just gay and fat, honey. He's not green.

What is your problem? Get lost, little Eichmann. 

Oh, it'll happen, don't worry. Right now your wife is being shot so full of subliminal messages, all she'll be thinking about afterwards is "blowjob."

It's a musical thing. Women are so caught up in all the singing and dancing they don't even notice it but, there's a blowjob reference almost every ten seconds. Broadway writers call it "subtext." Just listen really, really closely.

The incredibly fat and gay skinny straight man?

We must respect the wishes of people's BFFs. Otherwise, all our BFF necklaces would become meaningless

Yeah, we'll have one guy who like, who like, makes bread. A-and one guy who like, l-looks out for other people's safety.

Well I guess we could change the law to allow for medicinal marijuana to be sold just outside the door of the shop.

You know what would be better for me is Saturday afternoon.

That's right! We know whose fault this is!

I'm a really sad panda. I didn't know we were doing all that damage. This is all that damn lawyer's fault! 

Oh, what are you supposed to be? Oh  oh, right. You're supposed to be that um... uhhh... 

Uh, waitress, a-a-actually, I ordered the chicken soup. This is minnestrone.

Well, like the rest of you, I am shocked and appalled at what happened! I don't know if the parents are to blame or if it's the times we're living in, but something has to change!

Oh, so this is what it was like. 

Hello, are you folks holding this Passion meeting?

If we all put our heads together, we can find them!

You die, pigs!  You want to die, huh? 

Yeah? Well that makes you homeless, so get out of here before you die!

Yeah man, the corporations. Right now they're raping the world for money!

The homeless first started arriving in Evergreen about three months ago. At first there were only a few of them, askin' for change, sleeping in the parks. But then more showed up, and we realized there was somethin' different about them. They fed off of our change to the point that they could actually start renting apartments. We knew it wouldn't be long before the homeless actually started buying homes. And then we'd have no idea who was homeless and who wasn't! The people living in the house right next door to you could be homeless and you wouldn't even know!  Nobody could trust anybody! Fights broke out. War!  That's when I started suspecting that  my own wife, who I'd been living with for twenty years, was actually homeless. So I had to burn her. In her bed while she slept.  After she died I vowed I wouldn't let the homeless destroy our town! So we came up with a plan to get rid of them once and for all. 

That's far enough! Just march your butts right back out of our town!

And it was Texas who sent them to us! People in San Antonio got rid of their homeless by tellin' them what a great place Evergreen was!

You fuck your son and you won't even give him a kiss? Booooooo!

I'll take twenty lemon bars, you little rascals.

Yeah, uh I've done it a few times.

I love Chipotle. But getting all the bloodstains out of my underwear is a nightmare.
