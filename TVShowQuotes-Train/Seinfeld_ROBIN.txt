So, what about entertainment? (to kid) Should I get Barney?
Well, this time, you can blow out the candles.
But I saw you push the women and children out of the way in a mad panic! I saw you knock them down! And when you ran out, you left everyone behind!
Do you think 25 kids is too much?
But you yelled "get out of my way"!
If I didn't do it with you, I would have done it with someone else.
L-listen, Listen...I gotta think about this. (walks away.)
The burgers should be ready in a minute.
Maybe even someone who didn't say 'God bless you'.
George! Forget Bozo, George. Bozo's out. He's finished. It's over for Bozo.
