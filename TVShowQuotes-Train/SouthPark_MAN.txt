Follow the only road.

Look we're in a bit of a spot here! I've got a very important job interview tomorrow morning in Breckenridge, so I have to get my car fixed fast! Is there another garage in town?

I'd like to pay for one.

That's what you said about Peterson, and then you ended up having sex with him!

To do what?

I am not a homeless person. I am a new fourth-grade student.

It's alright, darling, they're just Canadian.

What?

They're right. We should have never crossed that picket line. Come on, honey. 

Hold it! 

I haven't seen a road marker for miles. What was the last highway we were on?

O-hoho! 

Sir, how can it be that a first timer scores that kind of thetan level?? He registered OT9! I'm only OT7 and I've been in the church all my life!

Where are we?

Kelly, please. Don't do this. I'm sorry.

Do you gentlemen need a hand? 

Nubanon.

Yea for us!

You haven't heard the last of us, officer! Together we are strong.  Come on, men! 

Aaaaa!

Look, I apologize, but I was just--

Howdy, Chef. How was your summer vacation? 

Stay back?! Hell, my wife and child are in there!

Looks like winter's right around the corner. Better get some firewood ready. 

Hup. Nono, Mantequilla! You're just blowing the leaves from one side to the other. Get them in one pile so you can use the garbage bags we loaned you.

Okay, so this is all the stuff we need to sign Michael in?

Alright, let's just... go, Linda. I don't have time for Spaceman Spiff's little games.

Aw geez. Come on in, kids.  It doesn't surprise me. More and more people are being blamed for 9/11 every day.

Hey!

Yes?

He's alive!

Take cover in the community center again!

Well, so where are they?

Uh the first chapter alone was filled with poetry.

You know, for Martha and I, we're, we're worried we might have a hard time raising our son atheist. I mean-  whoa, thank you -I mean,  it could end up being very difficult raising an atheist child in such a Christian society.  I feel that everywhere my poor son goes he's being persecuted for his beliefs. 

She's a whore. 

Yeah! Now it's a Wall-Mart!

Who? There weren't any "decks."

Oowhoops

AAAAAH!

What?

Ey! Screw you! 

Look at that. A bear, mining for coal.

Ah, be sure to get the edges.

We love you, Randy.

Well, maybe if we let him paint the garage, he'll feel more like family and then-

Get inside! 

Boo! 

Oh man, she's totally lip-syncing.

Bo-no! Woo-ooo!

Fine! Can you take us there?

Poor thing must have snuck across the border and then lost track of his family.

I work hard, so I need a laxative that works hard too!  I can't be constipated on the job.  That's why I need... Soft Serve.  Because when I'm constipated, sometimes even a hard push isn't enough.  Don't give up. Get back in there and get to work!  'Cause when the going gets tough, the tough gets going!

I'll get it, darling.  Hello? Hello?

Amen!

What the?  Oh no. No, no, no, no.

Welcome to San Francisco. I'm Peter Thompson. This is my wife, Nancy Jarvis, and our son, Brian Thompson-Jarvis  So how do you like the neighborhood?

What happened?

Hat McCollough. He was sent to prison in '82, and we believe he should be released!

Yes, Hope.

There, do you think that works?

Whoa, what is that??

Yeah, it's like, San Francisco is more of a European city, like Paris or Milan.

Oh. Yeah, Apple's stuff is pretty neat alright. I just don't want any big company tracking where I am at all times. 

Excuse me, how is this helping?

Next! 

There's no such thing, you little smartass! 

We love you, Randy.

I;m sorry, there's no Mr. Wall here.

Yeah! Tip assist!

God darn ya! 

Hey, Chef-o, we're gonna run down to the office supply store and get some leather holders for our pagers, you wanna come?

If there was a god, why would he let our kids be molested in the first place?

Yeah, what has Catholicism come to anyway?

Baltania, eh anyway, my heart is aching for their return. I, I know the American government will do what's right. 

Oh. Well, I guess we can always... just make another one.

Oooh. 

Hah haha.

It's horrible. We can't stop the oil from contaminatin' everything.

...It's... just you here?

Britney was chosen a long time ago, to be built up and adored, and then sacrificed. For harvest.

Devil worshipers! 

How I've missed them all. Little Nahlal.

What does it mean?

Let's go! Let's go!

My name is Harry Gints and this is my wife Elise. We're from Canada.

Of course I'm sure!

Look, look! Here comes somebody! 

...We knew you could do it, Jesus! 

Come on honey! 

Oh, good.

Linda, it's a remote-controlled car.  Looks like maybe there's a little camera on it. 

We love you, Randy.

Ah I don't know, just ignore him.

Nadia, my sweet Barshta

How about a phone? Can we just use the phone?

Just?!

...Yes, we need a mechanic to look at our car.

We can't help it! You're bawlin' us to tears! 

Maybe you're reading the map wrong.

What's this all about, Mr. Smith?

Nothin'. Just... shopping.

Well, it'll have to do. It's probably the only town for a hundred miles. 

I love you! I love you!

Allб

They've found another one! They've found another jakovasaur! 

All right, what the hell is going on around here? You sir need to leave this area- 

And then he uh, took his penis from behind our daughter's ear and uh, we uh, uh that's when we saw him with uh, the n-the three rings. and uh, his penis, he was pulling it through 'em somehow, uh.

I have no idea. Oh, we're gonna have to find some help quick. We're not gonna make it more than a couple of miles.

You guys come quick! I've only just heard!

They're getting a kick out the magician, huh?

Hey, you damned kids!  Get the hell out of my yard!

Geow, my arm! MY ARM! 

I'm Charles Kincade, from the Kincade Talent Agency? I just heard you broke a hundred thousand points on Guitar Hero.

Yeah! 

You know, it's just that a lot of people don't really believe in the whole Jesus thing anymore, you know? So what's to celebrate?

Great party, Mr. Mackey. Thank you so much.

Surprise! We've scraped some money together and got you something. 

And me.

AAWWWW!

I don't know! 

Yes! My name is Bill. Bill Cosby.

Nobody paid us anything! Now, there has been a crime here and you'd better do something about it!

Man, I've never seen a woman drink that much-you're amazing, Ms. Cartman.

Uh, Hooray!

Gerald Broflovski?

We demand you release these men at once!

Let's get out of this town!

I don't know, but she is pissed.

AWWWGH!

DMV people? They're the meanest people on planet Earth.

How do you like that, Mantequilla? Your very own leaf blower! Hahah, I have no idea how it works, but I'm sure you do, huh. Say, how would you like to go in the back yard and play? 

Hu-uh?!

Put it down, you bitch!

Hey, I'm sorry to bother you. There's uh, been an accident and I need a phone.

Oh, excuse me. I was just-  God-damned smartass! Do you think you could

Put the golf club down, you crazy bitch! 

Shit, Peter, you look like shit.

Darling, I don't know if we can keep him.

Yes.

Hello. This is Romanian father. I am desperate to have my girls returned to me in Romania.

Oh my God, are you alright?

Well, can you help us find the phone, please?

No, it's my damned garden and I'm sick of you kids dressin' up and havin' talks of betrayal in it!

...Well, yes I am, but I don't know what that has to do with anything.

Jim-my! Jim-my! Jim-my! Jim-my

We'll give you anything you want.

Nno, there are no Walls here.

Fellow members of NAMBLA. As you know, hn hn, we continue to be discriminated against. Recently, the FBI has started to arrest men, who are doing nothing more than trying to start a sexual relationship with a young boy.

Not as beautiful as you.
