Yeah, it's like, San Francisco is more of a European city, like Paris or Milan.

You guys come quick! I've only just heard!

Oh. Yeah, Apple's stuff is pretty neat alright. I just don't want any big company tracking where I am at all times. 

Whoa, what is that??

Stan Marsh?

You haven't heard the last of us, officer! Together we are strong.  Come on, men! 

Totally!

Yeah, who the heck finds this stuff interesting? 

...It's... just you here?

There, do you think that works?

Yes.

That's what you said about Peterson, and then you ended up having sex with him!

He's alive!

Wow, he's really great. We should get him to sing at Tommy's bar mitzvah 

They're right. We should have never crossed that picket line. Come on, honey. 

Look, I apologize, but I was just--

What the?  Oh no. No, no, no, no.

Oh darling, look. Thanksgiving turkeys.

Come on honey! 

We love you, Randy.

I'm Charles Kincade, from the Kincade Talent Agency? I just heard you broke a hundred thousand points on Guitar Hero.

Relax, Tweek. I am not here to hurt you. I am the Ghost of Human Kindness.

You know, it's just that a lot of people don't really believe in the whole Jesus thing anymore, you know? So what's to celebrate?

Very funny!

Look we're in a bit of a spot here! I've got a very important job interview tomorrow morning in Breckenridge, so I have to get my car fixed fast! Is there another garage in town?

Hate mongerer! Hate mongerer!

Hm... Well, let's just walk away then. 

Great party, Mr. Mackey. Thank you so much.

Oh hello there, you must be the new neighbors.

Hello there, Christopher. 

Uh, excuse me.  Eric Cartman?

Oh my gosh, honey look it's Tupac! I told you them homies didn't cap his ass!  Oh, this is going on Instagram! 

Hup. Nono, Mantequilla! You're just blowing the leaves from one side to the other. Get them in one pile so you can use the garbage bags we loaned you.

Aw geez. Come on in, kids.  It doesn't surprise me. More and more people are being blamed for 9/11 every day.

What's happening here?

I don't know, but she is pissed.

What?

Britney was chosen a long time ago, to be built up and adored, and then sacrificed. For harvest.

Yeah, yeah, yeh-oh? 

We are NAMBLA, the North American Man Boy Love Association, and we heard about these political prisoners you're keeping?

AAWWWW!

God darn ya! 

Oh, it's little Eric!

Nadia, my sweet Barshta

Honey? Honey, what's wrong? 

We demand you release these men at once!

Well that's what I'm telling you. It was right here exce-except for the thing where he poured the milk into his penis; he did that over there.

Looks like winter's right around the corner. Better get some firewood ready. 

...We knew you could do it, Jesus! 

Uh the first chapter alone was filled with poetry.

Put it down, you bitch!

Hello. This is Romanian father. I am desperate to have my girls returned to me in Romania.

Ah I don't know, just ignore him.

Howdy, Chef. How was your summer vacation? 

Down with KoRn!

Follow the only road.

Yep, window.

See a movie?

No, it's my damned garden and I'm sick of you kids dressin' up and havin' talks of betrayal in it!

There's no such thing, you little smartass! 

Jim-my! Jim-my! Jim-my! Jim-my

All these men wanted was to love a young boy!  There is nothing wrong with love!

What?

Alright, let's just... go, Linda. I don't have time for Spaceman Spiff's little games.

Yeah! Now it's a Wall-Mart!

What?

Devil worshipers! 

How are we not to cry. Our hearts have been broken, our lives ruined, and now we are set to die!

Linda, it's a remote-controlled car.  Looks like maybe there's a little camera on it. 

They've found another one! They've found another jakovasaur! 

My name is Geoff Hamill. I'm the founder and CEO of Vagisil.

Well, so where are they?

Amen!

Hold on!  Hold on!

Poor thing must have snuck across the border and then lost track of his family.

I have no idea. Oh, we're gonna have to find some help quick. We're not gonna make it more than a couple of miles.

Eh?!

Not as beautiful as you.

Oh, good.

My father died in a stamp-collecting accident.

The pube fair?

Shit, Peter, you look like shit.

Kelly, please. Don't do this. I'm sorry.

Sure, I remember you!  You got it, baby... You got it, baby 

Hat McCollough. He was sent to prison in '82, and we believe he should be released!

Allб

...Yes, we need a mechanic to look at our car.

Well, maybe if we let him paint the garage, he'll feel more like family and then-

Let's get out of this town!

Yes! My name is Bill. Bill Cosby.

Darling, I don't know if we can keep him.

We love you, Randy.

Boo! 

Fine! Can you take us there?

Hey, you damned kids!  Get the hell out of my yard!

Sir?

Yeah! Tip assist!

To do what?

How I've missed them all. Little Nahlal.

I'll get it, darling.  Hello? Hello?

Father Maxi?

Hey, he's right!

AWWWGH!

Hey!

Take cover in the community center again!

They're getting a kick out the magician, huh?

Nno, there are no Walls here.

Nothin'. Just... shopping.

It's alright, darling, they're just Canadian.

It's Jesus! 

What happened?

Oh. Well, I guess we can always... just make another one.

How do you like that, Mantequilla? Your very own leaf blower! Hahah, I have no idea how it works, but I'm sure you do, huh. Say, how would you like to go in the back yard and play? 

It's Mr. Garrison! Only it ISN'T Mr. Garrison! He- He's a woman now! 

Oh, I see! Is this the Johnson boys from down the street?!

Surprise! We've scraped some money together and got you something. 

Aaawwwwwww! 

I'd like to pay for one.

Stay back?! Hell, my wife and child are in there!

...Well, yes I am, but I don't know what that has to do with anything.

Do you gentlemen need a hand? 

Step... away... from the towel! 

Excuse me, how is this helping?

Just?!

Ho-hoh.

Hah haha.

Look, look! Here comes somebody! 

Who? There weren't any "decks."

Yes?

If there was a god, why would he let our kids be molested in the first place?

Not as beautiful as- 

Oh my God, are you alright?

Can I get on that 7:30 a.m. flight?

All right, what the hell is going on around here? You sir need to leave this area- 

AAAAAH!

Okay, so this is all the stuff we need to sign Michael in?

Let them play!

I;m sorry, there's no Mr. Wall here.

Aaaaa!

Oh my God!

It sure is. I-I can barely see. 

I am not a homeless person. I am a new fourth-grade student.

Well, can you help us find the phone, please?

Nobody paid us anything! Now, there has been a crime here and you'd better do something about it!

Loving young boys has been around since the time of the Romans, pal! There's nothing wrong with it! We are an organization dedicated to showing that sex between a man and a young boy can be a beautiful thing!

Welcome to San Francisco. I'm Peter Thompson. This is my wife, Nancy Jarvis, and our son, Brian Thompson-Jarvis  So how do you like the neighborhood?

Oh man, she's totally lip-syncing.

Hey, I'm sorry to bother you. There's uh, been an accident and I need a phone.

Hold it! 

And me.

Man, I've never seen a woman drink that much-you're amazing, Ms. Cartman.

O-hoho! 

Aaww!  Is there a problem, young man?

What does it mean?

Kenny McCormick! He's alive at the hospital! 

How about a phone? Can we just use the phone?

Oooh. 

Panda bears make me sad. They're almost extinct.

Get inside! 

It's horrible. We can't stop the oil from contaminatin' everything.

Ah, be sure to get the edges.

Of course I'm sure!

Yes, Hope.

Oowhoops

Nubanon.

Sir, how can it be that a first timer scores that kind of thetan level?? He registered OT9! I'm only OT7 and I've been in the church all my life!

Baltania, eh anyway, my heart is aching for their return. I, I know the American government will do what's right. 

Gerald Broflovski?

Hu-uh?!

C'est drôle et amusant (That was SO FUNNY!!) 

We love you, Randy.

Ey! Screw you! 

That's sexual harassment.

Hey everybody, you're not gonna believe it!

My name is Harry Gints and this is my wife Elise. We're from Canada.

Fellow members of NAMBLA. As you know, hn hn, we continue to be discriminated against. Recently, the FBI has started to arrest men, who are doing nothing more than trying to start a sexual relationship with a young boy.

Where are we?

Yea for us!

DMV people? They're the meanest people on planet Earth.

Maybe you're reading the map wrong.

Oh, that's Christmas for ya.

Uh, Hooray!

You know, for Martha and I, we're, we're worried we might have a hard time raising our son atheist. I mean-  whoa, thank you -I mean,  it could end up being very difficult raising an atheist child in such a Christian society.  I feel that everywhere my poor son goes he's being persecuted for his beliefs. 

What's this all about, Mr. Smith?

Totally!

I don't know! 

Oh, my God, it's crap!

Get inside. 

I haven't seen a road marker for miles. What was the last highway we were on?

Listen to her!
