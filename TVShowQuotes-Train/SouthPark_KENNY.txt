(Me too!) 

(Yeah!) 

(Blue.)

(Woohoo!) 

(Ugh!)

(Hi, Cartman.)

Yeah, sure, whatever. 

(Yeah, it was awesome! I was just sitting down and then I got my period!)

(Stop taping!)

(This is not herpes, it's a cold sore!)

(What?)

(They didn't put me at the bottom, did they?)

(Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha) 

(Fuck yeah!)

(All right!)

(They're gonna hurt our chances.)

(Yeah.)

(Yeah)

Nohoho! No, not the socks! Ahhhgh, stop!

(This will be awesome!)

(And not getting a blowjob...)

(Sir, please, I'm supposed to get laid for the first time on Saturday.)

(I don't know!)

(I'm okay, I guess.)

(Yes. That's right.) 

(You don't?)

(I agree. Let's put in this DVD and watch Grey's Anatomy.)

(Look, they're nothing, but...)

(What?)

(But what?)

(Mhm.)

(Sixty two)

(Okay.)

(I know.)

(Yeah, I don't get it.)

(Oh my God, I get it.)

(No fuckin' way, dude!)

(Hmmm. What the fuck?) 

(Oh.)

(Hey, just accept Faith Hilling is out of style!)

(Well I don't know.) 

(...Ten bucks!)

(Ow!)

(You've ever done?!)

(AAAARRRRHHH!)

(God-damn, it stinks like shit!)

(All right! I know!)

(I'm sorry guys. Faith Hilling is just a stupid fad, right?)

(You what?)

(Aah-) 

(Yeah, what's her name?)

(Yeah!)

(Uh huh.)

(Woohoohoo!)

(Woohoohoo! Woooohoooo! Woooohoohoo!)

(You guys! You guys, oh shit, come check this out!) 

(Me too!)

(Sonofabitch!) 

('Cause, dude, I'll fuckin' die!)

(Oh that fucking asshole!)  (Oh that fucking asshole, I'm gonna talk to him...)

(I just threw my ninja star at him.)

(Woohoo!)

(Help help! Heeelllppp!) 

(Pakew! Pakew!)

(OH, SHIT!)

(Thanks, Stan.)

(Cool!)

(Woohooo!)

(Woohoo!  Woohoooo!)

(I fucking hate you!)

(Eeww.)

(No, I'm partners with Craig) 

(Uh huh.)

(Huh?) 

(But Dad, I-)

(Don't worry, I'm alright. Argh!) 

(Ow!)

(Okay.) 

(Woohoo!!)

Hey.  Fuck you, Cartman.

(Hey, what's that?)

(Yeah, I guess. I just wonder about McNuggets.)

(Huh?)

(Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo-hoo! Yeah, hey, yay!) 

(Oh, yeah)

(Con Te Partirт?) (...Su navi per mariche, io lo so,no, no, non esistono piщ.con te io li rivivrт. 'Con te...)

(Oh boy.)

(Wait...)

(Awww.)

(Heeeeyyyy, kick ass)  (Ow!) 

(Like what?)

(Yeah, No shit.)

(No we don't, guys.)

(Damn!)

(Yeah, I feel bad for the roosters.)

(Goddamn.)

(Uh huh!)

(Thanks.) 

Quack-quack.

(No way!)

(Yeah. I guess so.)

(God damn it, someone help me!)

Minna-san, ii yo. Purincessu Kenni ganbaru.

Quack-quack.

(Woohoo! Oh man!)

(Woohoo!)

(Heellp!!)

(Fuck no, I wasn't looking at a handkerchief!)

(Yeah.) 

(Stop!)  (Officer Barbrady, I really need to talk to you!)  (Shit!)

(Whoops!)

(You guys, take it seriously.)

(What?)

(Okay!) 
(A what?)

(Hey, guys!)  (Heey-ungh)  (Oowww.)

(Yep! Woo-hoo!) 

(No!)

(All right!)

(Hey!)

(Hey, God damn it!)

(Uh huh)

(Wooo!) 

(Cartman?! Cartman, you've gotta help me, and I'm not foolin' around!)

(Okay, okay! I'll go.) 

(All right. How am I supposed to do that?)

(Take off the ring? You can take off the ring??)  (Really?)

(I don't know. It just seems kind of... mean)

(A little like a vagina.)

(Yes, sir..!)

(Aw, now don't say that. Poor little kid.)

(This isn't a prank, Kyle!)

(How do you do that?)

(con te io li rivivrт.)

(What? Hey, let go.)

(I'm not eatin' that!)

(Well yep, that's what I think.)

(I can't make love to you until we get a king-size bed!)

(Okay, I've reached the generator)

(Yeah!)

(And they're all shot.) 

(No!)

(Me??)

(I'm all right)

(Yeeeeehah!) 

(Woohooo!) 

(Oh my God, I think they're screwing.)

(Me?)

(Butters!)

(Hey, that's odd.)  (Hey, I'm floating. That can't be! Hey wait!) 

(I don't really know!)

(That's what that means!)

(Dude, maybe he's like mentally ill or something)

(That sounds totally fuckin' stupid.)

(Damn, I'd like to get a taste of her!)

(Yeah! Yeeaahh!)

(Fuck you!)

(I wanna be really good)

(Eric! Eric!)

(Fine!)

(No!)

(I fuckin' hate Craig!)

(Waa-ooo!) 

(No, I'm not going to fucking betray anybody!)

(The titties! Oh my god, they were incredible!)

(I don't see anything.)

(A football machine?)

(Yeah, they totally kick ass at spanking!)

(Hit the X button, Kyle!)

(Okay.) 

(Yeah!)

(What are we gonna do?)

(No!!) 

(Uh huh.)

(What??)

(The Geniuses...)

(Malibu? But how?)

(Hey you guys, what's goin' on?)

(Okay.)

(Squirts?)

(Where am I?)

(Wait!) 

(Just face it, dude, your uncle's stupid!)

(It's okay, I'll use my head!) 

(Yeah.)

(Thank you, Doc.)

(Yeah!)

(Goodbbyyyyee-ugh!)

(Yeah!)

(Hey!)

(Oh no! I have got to stay away fro-aaagh!)  (Ugh!)

(So?)

Previously, on South Park.

(Kyle's crazy!)

(Oh my God!)  (Owww!) 

(Oh fuck I'm gettin' out of here!) 

(Yeah, I know, dude.)

(This is Team B.)

(Yes)

(Excuse me, he needs to go to Hawaii.)

(Oh no!) 

(The Make-A-Wish Foundation?)

(Yeah, that was my idea.)

(I don't know!)

(Con te...)

(Yep. I like the food!)

(Oh my God!) 

(Nope, I'm okay.)  (It-aah. It hurts! IT HURTS!)  (Ugh.)

(Woohoo!)

(Run, dude!) 

(Uff--!) 

(Oh, no kidding.)

(Yaaayaya.)

(That is the sickest thing I have ever fucking seen!)

Waaah? Sugoi-chan. 

(Yeah, maybe we should.)

(No fucking way!)

(Yeah. Tammy said if I got her the tickets for the concert, she would give me a B.J.!)

(If you wanna get high and jack off, it's cool.)

(Wazzup? Ho-Ho! Wooooooo!)

Dudes!

(I would do anything!) 

(Yeah, fuck him!)

(Bye, ladies.) 

(Not guilty!)

(Thanks.) 

(Hey, Tammy!)

(I'm not ruining my life, okay, you God damned fucking psychos.)

(We can watch it at my house.)

(Yeah, right! Awesome!)

(Yeah. I agree.) 

(Hello.)

(Hey cool! Check it out!)

(Hehyayaya hehyayaya!)

Aaaah! Aaaah, stop! A- 

(Yeah!)

(Woohoo!)

(Well, why do I have to be the one to go and find chicks?)

(Butters!)

(No, fuck you! She's my girl!)

(What's a great idea?)

(What?)

(Huh?)

(Damn.)

(Who fuckin' cares?)

(Oh my God, they've killed Cartman!)

(Yeah.)  (It isn't fair I was so close to getting a blow job and I'll never get one now - this is fucking bullshit...) 

(Awww, don't be so mean. Butters is our friend, huh?) 

(I don't know.)

Ptui. 

I don't know. I really don't give a shit.

(Yeah! Take this, Professor Chaos!)  (Feel my wrath!) 

What's going on, Kyle?

(no, no, non esistono piщ.)

(Yes they do.)

(Yeah.)

(What?!)

(Hey! Fuck off!) 

(What the fuck are you talking about?)

(It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's operation-)

(Haaarrrrrh!)  (Huh?)

(What?!)  (Oh, the nerve! How insensitive of you, you cock-sucking faggot!)

(Dude!)

(What?!)

(Gah!)

(Hey, look out!) 

(And mine too.)

(Aw, it's okay, kid. It's not going to hurt.) 

(Oh, Grey's Anatomy. Cool! Oh man, this is a great DVD. We're gonna have the ... sex, yeah.)

(Thanks.) 

(Oh, God damn it!)

(No, no.)

(Woohoo!)

(Almost 7:30)

(I don't know. Where could it be?)

(...What?)

(Woo-hoo!)

(Oh you forgot to get some Judas Priest.)

(Huh?)

(Okay. I can do that.)  (Christ!) 

(I'll do it.)

(Woohoo!)

(Aw, Goddamnit!)

(Aaaargh!)

(Uh-oh.)  (Help me, Kyle! What are we gonna do?)

(What? Is it?)

(Yes! Woohoo! I did it! I reached level s-!) 

(You do?)

(Woohoo!) 

(HA! You fucking lose!)

(No, No, Scrotie McBoogerballs)

(Well,... ...and I can't take any of that!)

(Awww.)

(Uh oh.)

(Sheesh!)

(Nooo!!) 

(Yeah.)

(Here you go.)  (No way!) 

(Welcome to my kingdom, Sir Eric. Now, state your purpose.)

(Go, dude!)

(What about me?)

(Uh oh. Ow!) 

(Yeah. Totally.)

(Aa-choo!)

(Red Lobster!)

(I understand, dude.)

(Let me try! Let me try!)

(My name's Kenny.)

(Mexico?! Why the heck do I have to take you all the way to Mexico?!)

(Look at that!  What's he doin'?)

(Are you serious?!)

(Hey you guys, wait up for me!)  (Waaah!) 

(Yes. I'm looking for some morning-after abortion-)

(Commentary?)

(Ready.)  (Oh,  shiiit. Damnit! Cartman, I've got to go to the bathroom!) 

(What?)  (Where'd she go?) 

To wit, I have found nothing wrong with this remote place, and I must admit it will be with some melancholy that I will leave this island and return home.
I saw this chick in a bikini on the beach too. She had the nicest boobs ever.
Humbly yours, Kenneth.

(What's that?)

(Woo-hoo!!) 

My dear friends of the mainland,
What adventures I have found on the tiny island of Kava'i. I have truly become one with the natives, who found new courage to fight their oppressors.

(What?!)

(I don't know. I can't find him.)

(Dude! What the fuck!)

(Cartman's ass is so fuckin' huge that they could probably show six stupid films on it and still have some room, heheheheheh) 

(che, io lo so,)

(This is Eric Cartman.)

(It means I'm gonna be pure and not have sex until I get married.)

(Eric, well you're my best friend, too.)

(What kind of fuckin' miracle?!) 

(Hm hm, noho, that's not what it means.)

(Well now, that does it! I have had enough of this bullshit! Screw you, Stan. I'm going home!) 

(I can't take it!)

(Wooooooooo! Woo! Wazzup? Wazzup?) 

(Ahow..!)

(No, it's Kenny.)

(Plenty. This is 'cause my family's poor.)

(Giant douche.)

(Or are you gonna hit her with your hand?)

(Me neither!)

(Jimmy.)

(It's the only thing I could afford.)

(Come on!) 

(Come here, mom! Let me get it!) 

(Oh, I've just been hanging out.)

(I just want to be on TV.)

(Hey, can I have that?)  (Heey.)

(No you fucking don't!)

(Why?)

(Hehe, yeah, heh) 

(Dude, shut the fuck up about my house!)

(Well, see you guys. I gotta go take the bus out of town.)

(Um...) 

(Yeah.)

Purincessu Kenni daijobu dayo! 

(Yeah, that'd be awesome!)

(Woohoo!) 

(Hey, you guys...) 

(I did! I was really excited to get a B.J. but now I have to wear this motherfucking purity ring!)

(What the hell? What the fuck is this?!) 

(Yes, I agree. I think Craig is a thousand times as cool as Clyde. There doesn't really seem to be a doubt.)

(Ow, mom!)

All right, but you guys owe me for this.

(I'm not his best friend.)

(Yeah!)

(Please, could you just let him on the plane? It's really important. Please?)

(This is fucking ridiculous.)

(How big's your penis, Chef?)

(Oh, well now that's sweet.)

(No! Nono! No! Don't do this! Nononooo!) 

(Yahoo!) 

(Yeah, I think so.)

(Good for me.)

(Heheehee, heheh yeahah)

(Nononono-yikes!) 

(AAAAAAAAAAAAAA...) 

(Oh, shit, we're locked in.)

(Ow.)

Stan and Kyle, you take the back entrance. Cartman and I will block him from the side.

(Aw, man!) 

(Rrrh!)

(Nuh uh!)

(Aw come on, fuck you!) 

(...partirт.)

(Fuck you.)

(Look at me! Look at me!)

(Me too.)

(I'm doing my homework.)

(Dude, fuck you!)

(Okay.)

(No, he's telling the truth) 

(Uh huh)

(Hey, that's not fair! I got the fucking ticket!)  (Hey! What the heck!)

(Reaaly??)

(All right! Come on, let's get to the parking lot. Woo-hoo!) 

(Oh, that's alright.)

(Hey, you guys. I'm right here.)

(Or look at the cat on her feet, then touch her.)

(FIVE BUCKS???) 

(Yeah, dude!)

(Ow!)

(Yeah, it's fucking crazy!)

(Hey.)

(Here.) 

Hai, Purincessu Kenni assisuto! 

(Woohoo!) 

(Because! His grandmother just died and her will says Cartman now has a million dollars!)

(Shop class?)  (No, I won't!)

(Yeahhh!)

(Europe?)

(Yes.)  (But what about Stan?)

(Yeah.)

(Su navi per mari)

(I almost... touched them.)

(Oh- ooowww!)

(Red Lobster!)

Minna-san! Kenni kimasu! 

(Okay, try to get closer!)

(Dude, what the fuck is so filthy or offensive in here?)

(You never seem to care when I die!)

(Yeah!)

(Yeah, it totally sucked!)

(What?)

(Jesus Christ, he fucking shot that guy!)

(Hello!)

(Good.) 

(There's a lot of fuckin' vaginas and penises.)

(Woohoo!)  (I mean, 'Oh.') 

(Wow, that is awesome!)

(I knew you're up to something!)

(Yeah dude, I fucked you up.)

(Totally!)

(Oh no!)

(Waa-choo!)

(Hehe, yeah. Hehe)

(Waarrggh!!)  (Dude! You guys, I really, really don't have time to tell you that-- Argghh..!) 

(Okay. Got to have some huggin'.) 

(What the fuck are stem cells?)

(Fuck this!) 

(Being poor has nothing to do with NASCAR!)

(Yeah, how the fuck is that?!)

(Yeah!)

(Get him!)

(At Red Lobster.)

(Ungh.) 

(How about we put a real fire out?)

(Aahhh!)

(Uh-uh.)

(Oh, no!) 

(Hi guys.)  (Uh oh.)  (Uff. I'm okay.)  (I'm oKAAAYYYYYYY!!!) 

With the war at an end, our Butters is able to have his hapa noa ceremony. And with any help from the gods, become his old cheery self again.

(Woohoo!) 

(Oh, no!) 

(What the fuck did you do that for?)

(Stop this car!)

(And it's time for us to come clean.) 

(Gaaahaha, he got you again!)

(HAAAAAAAAGH!) 

(A party?!)

(Yeah, totally awesome!)

(Yeah, it's like killing a dead pig and a turkey.) 

My dearest friends.
I am living amongst the natives in the remote and tiny island of Kava'i. What can I tell you of this mysterious island and its people? It is a place of wonder, and yet to the outsider like me, a place of odd tradition. The people here are peaceful and joyous, and seem to care little for the rush and worry of the outside world. Their diet is mostly an odd mixture of coconut milk, pineapple juice, and vodka, which they call the chi-chi. As for Butters, he is quickly learning the ways of his ancestors, and seems to be feeling better with every passing day. He still seems quite angry at times, but luckily his ceremony will finally take place on the morrow.

(Yeah!)

(Hey!)  (Hey, you guys! I'm dy--) 

(Really?) 

(unintelligible)

(Kyle has Jesus' head instead!)

(Yeah.)

(Yes. What's up, my lord?)

(Sure you can.) 

(AH how!) 

(Dad, I wanna play catch.)

(Woohoo!)

(You see? Look at all these piles of food. He must have been here for days!)

Dude, fuck this. Let's bail! 

(Yeah!) 

(That's not good?)

(Those titties are fuckin' huge!) 

(Huh? Uh.)  (AAAAAA!)  (Ufff!)  (Ugh!)

(Giant Douche! Vote for him!)

(No, Mom, I'm seriously sick!)

Yeah, Stan?

(Uh-huh.)

(No, swear to God it's true! Cartman's got a million dollars!)

(Yes, I believe we do.)

Nonono wait, I'm not Blanket!

(Hey, can I have a drink of water?)

(Yeah, I was kinda thinking we could go to TGI Friday's.)

(It's when you take your finger, and you stick it in a vagina and you stick it in again and again.)

(Me too.)

(Look, Mom. I just fixed you a drink.) 

(What the fuck are we doing?)

(Like what?)

(Hey yeah!)

(Yeah!)

(Phew!)

(And I'm not gonna have last 5 days without death...) 

(What? These?)

(Nuh uh.) 

(Me too!)

(We've gotta bring somebody else on.)

(Hunh?) 

(Woohoo!!) 

(Yeah, that's because you vomit on her all the time.) 

(No they don't wanna see a child die! You guys! Uf.)

(Yeah! Fuck you!)

(It's a giant stick that goes inside the mom's vagina) 

(Chef!)

(Nuh uh!)

(Ach) 

Mmmmmm! 

(Yeah.)

(No.)

(Yeah dude, I looove NASCAR.)

(Craig just asked me to do his show, geez.)

(That guy would try anything)

(Ee-hew-hoo!)

(Right. What the fuck is going on?)

(I'd like a box of condoms, please.)

(What?!)

(Get the fuck off of me!)

(Yeah, totally!)

(Woohoo!)

(Woohoo!)

(Hey you guys. Remember when Terrance and Phillip was off the air?)

(Yeah, can we go?)

Yes. We saw their faces.

(You guys, just fly away!)

(What?! No! What are you doing?!)  (You fuckers!) 

(Yeah, it's a purity ring.)

(They're the biggest breasts that I've seen)

(I told you it was a bad idea.)

(Where am I?)

(I think that Garrison said that gay people suck.)

(Hey, dude.)

(Nuh-uh.)

(Sure!)

(Me?)

(Nuh-uh.)

(Yep.)

(Why the fuck does it have to be my tooth?)

(Stan??)

(What??)

(I guess the only thing I wish is to not die.)

Tadaima! 

(Really?!)

(Oh, hi, guys.)

(Hey, you guys, I'm a little bit be-)  (Oof.)

(Yeah!)

(No. Fuckin' Madonna...) 

(Why don'tcha keep your head down?!) 

(Argh! That's just so untrue.)

(Dude, these are my fucking food stamps! How am I going to eat without all these food stamps?)

(Yeah! How cool!)

(Hey guys, what's going on with you?)

(Awesome.)

(Jonas Brothers?)

(All I know is that it was a loong time ago, and Death was chasing us on a bicycle down the street.)

(Huh?)

(Uh huh?)

(Rrrrooowwwrrr, rroowwrr, pew, pew, POW.) 

(Woohoo!)

(Hello, Chef.)

(She's not here right now.)

(I am. He's right here.) 

(Hey!)

(No, check his penis) 

(You guys! You guys, over here! ...Hey!)

(Hey dude, I like to shave my balls.)

(Well, there's gonna be a bunch of rats until they put the freakin' ceiling in.)

(Yeah.)

(What?)

(Woooooh! Woooooh!) 

(Woohoo!)

(That's okay, Kyle.)

(Hey, that freakin' bike-!) 

(Ah, fuck you!) 

(Woohoo!)

(Yeah.)

(I'm telling you, it's Kyle you want. He's the one who tried to get me in here, and you know it.)

(What?!)

(Yeah, me neither.)

(Uh huh.)

The American government finally gave in to the natives and had the Mahalo Rewards cards reinstated. Our two cultures, it appears, will once again live in peace.

(I think so too.)

(Dammit, here!)

(Yeah!)

(Me too.)

(Yeah.)

(Yeah, what are we supposed to do?)

(Yeah, I didn't- 

(Uh huh!)

(Shut up, Cartman, you blood-belching vagina!)

(A big mutant Stan?!)

(Fuck you!)

(Very well, thank you.)

(Look at this. More DVDs.) 

(Daaarrrggghh--)  (-ooggghhh...)

(Uh oh.)

(Butters, come on.)

(You know what I think? Basically, if you let the decision of what you watch stop at the parents' control, then what can you see? It'll stay the same because they'll just get offended although their kids are not delighted with the television series they put on for their kids.)

(Me, too.)

(Ehe, that makes you very fucking gay.)

(Well, I think you guys should name it Steve)

(Our egg is okay.)

(Meee toooo.) 

(Uh-huh) 

(Aa-choo!)

(N-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O!) 

(That's the truth.)

(Ow.)

(Nahit chaim.)  (Ha! Hiheh haha.)  (Hah! Oh my God!)

(Yeah!)

(I said, Shut up, Cartman, you blood-belching vagina!)

(Hi, Mr. Adler.)

(Okay)

(It's fucking disgusting!)

(What the fuck is that?!)

(Yeah they do!)

(Yeah, we've been talking.)

(Are you fuckin' telling me that I could've fuckin' gone that way?!)

(Woohoo!)

(Oof. Oh this Goddamned freakin'-  AARGH  Goddamn, why-  Oh this freakin'-  AARGH  Phew.  Well, I'm fine, guys!  Now if I can- 

(Yeah, me too.)

(Whoa, dude.)

(No way in hell I'm doing it.)

(Autoerotic asphyxiation? What's that?)

(Oh my God, they killed Mephesto!)

(What do we do now?)

(Yeah, and I got this nice marble sack to go with this carrot stick, see?)

(And then we gotta go down and get a piece of paper and write down each one of the words we sang on the tape deck. And then, sing it back again!)

(Yeah.)

(A little.)

(Awesome)

("And I want to see you handling your breasts.")

(Dude, it's just a fever blister!)

(What's happening now?)

(Kelly, you said it!) 

(Yeah, it's really good.)

(Yehes!)

(I could get to level sixty!)

(Hey you guys, I talked to Garrison and he told me that they're almost the same.)

(I think if we run, try to get Eric to drop his tea)

(NO.)

(No! NASCAR fans aren't stupid! Cartman is!)

(Goddammit, Cartman!)

(What the fuck are you doing here?!)

(AAAAHH!)

(We're almost there!)

(Woohoo!)

(Negative.)

(What?!)

(Oh, it was only my jacket.)

(Kyle, I'm gonna camp and watch the meteor shower. Do you wanna come and see it with me?)

(Yeah!)

(Mine is so fuckin' badass it's gotta win now!)

(Yeah.)

(Fuck yeah!)

(He's not gonna do it?!) 

(I came here to kick your ass once and for all!)

(Huh-uh, I ain't gonna get inside that ring! Aaah!) 

(AAAAHH!) 

(Well, I like you-)

(Ohhhhh, look!)  (You guys!)

(Dude, it's a pipe for your peepee)

(Yeah, see ya.)

Beavers! 

(How about this?)

(Of course, dude!)

(Yes, sir!)

(I have to go pee.)

(Woohoo!)

(Maybe she'll suck my dick)

(Hunh?)

(Uh--)

(Heheh, yeah. You're a faggot, dude. Fuck, yeah. Hehe-eheh.)

(Sure!)

Purincessu Kenni reporuto! 

(Jesus fucking Christ!)

(Toronto?)

(No I don't! Thank you.)

(Oh, there, there now. There's nothing to be afraid of, dear.) 

(Nooo!) 

(What?)  (Oh oooooooOOOOOOOH!) 

(A purity ring.)

What the hell is going on, you guys?

(Dude, what the fuck are you doing?!)

(Uh huh)

(Yup! I see it in the drift.)

(In my family, it's a silly enterprise.)

(Yee he hee!) 

(Awesome, dude!)

(What's that?) 

(OOOWWW!)

(Kenny McCormick.)

(Perhaps, he's just too big to get out of bed) 

(Damn, I'd like to get a taste of her!)

(Fuck?!)

(That I what?)

(What?!)

(What?!) 

(You got pubes??)

(No.)

(Shut the fuck up, dude! You're a fuckin' asshole!)

(WHAT?!)

(Yes.)

(I don't know.)

(And me!)

(Well, I'm gonna give my grandfather a full-body sensual massage.)

(Yes I am! I've got the costume; it's waiting in the house! Yesterday I got this huge package in the mail, and it was big, okay?) 

(I can keep the baby...)

(Hey, you guys! You guys, I think I know precisely what it's saying. It says that we've gotta go and find a pile of records and get the one that has the entire lyrics, and then we gotta get into learning to rearrange them.)

(Wing?) 

(All right dude, let me go now!) 

(Aaaaaa!) 

(Mom!) 

(I don't know. That seems quite pointless.)

(Yeah.)

(I don't know where he went!)

Ha? Ueddingu? 

(Woohoo!) 

(Uh oh...)

(Heheheh. Now that's what I-he call a sticky situation!) 

(Fuck you!)

(Yes it is!)

(He actually killed it!)

(Fuck! Oops!) 

(No. All I could get was a couple of tampons.)

(I did, I gotta go again...)

(And did you stick it in right when the fireplace gave you the shadow light?)

(No, I'm not young and I want a B.J.)

(Shuriken. Awesome!)

(What the fuck is going on?)

(I don't wanna take shop class!) 

(Heeeeeyah! Ugh--!) 

(I'll stick 'em together)

(All right. I'm fine.)

(You can change your mind instead of fighting with us, Eric.)

(Dilapidated titties incorporated.)

(What are we gonna do??)

(Are you serious?!)

(What? Fuck you!)

(Don't take it personally, Kyle.)

{Maybe he took a dump and got sick.} 

(No! Daddy!) 

(I swear too.)

(Come on, Squirts, we gotta run! We're already god-damned late!)

(Oh yeah! Woohoo!)

(Yeah!)

(Hey guys. What's goin' on?)

(Woohoo!)

(Hey!)  (Hey!)

(Yeah, look at yourself, dude.)

(Aww, that's bullshit!)

(Let's see... No, not there)  (Let's see. Nothing there)  (Let's see... here!) 

(Uh-huh.) 

(What the fuck for?!)

(Yeah, I feel that she's a freakin' bitch!)

(Oh, fuck it, dude.)
