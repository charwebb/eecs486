(You never seem to care when I die!)
(...partirт.Su navi per mariche, io lo so,no, no, non esistono piщ.)'(Io con te...!)
(Yes, I agree. I think Craig is a thousand times as cool as Clyde. There doesn't really seem to be a doubt.)
(Please, could you just let him on the plane? It's really important. Please?)
(Well, why the fuck do I have to do everything while you stand around in the snow lookin--) 
(And then we gotta go down and get a piece of paper and write down each one of the words we sang on the tape deck. And then, sing it back again!)
(Yeah, I guess. I just wonder about McNuggets.)
(You guys, I'm gonna try and win that costume contest!)
(Why the fuck does it have to be my tooth?)
(I think that Garrison said that gay people suck.)
(Huh-uh, I ain't gonna get inside that ring! Aaah!) 
(Because they're trying to take over the world?)
(Well now, that does it! I have had enough of this bullshit! Screw you, Stan. I'm going home!) 
(Nope, I'm okay.)  (It-aah. It hurts! IT HURTS!)  (Ugh.)
(Yeah, that's because you vomit on her all the time.) 
My dearest friends.
I am living amongst the natives in the remote and tiny island of Kava'i. What can I tell you of this mysterious island and its people? It is a place of wonder, and yet to the outsider like me, a place of odd tradition. The people here are peaceful and joyous, and seem to care little for the rush and worry of the outside world. Their diet is mostly an odd mixture of coconut milk, pineapple juice, and vodka, which they call the chi-chi. As for Butters, he is quickly learning the ways of his ancestors, and seems to be feeling better with every passing day. He still seems quite angry at times, but luckily his ceremony will finally take place on the morrow.
(I did! I was really excited to get a B.J. but now I have to wear this motherfucking purity ring!)
(No. All I could get was a couple of tampons.)
(Aw, now don't say that. Poor little kid.)
(You guys, come get this fucking magnet noooowwww!)  (Argh--!)
(Dude, maybe he's like mentally ill or something)
(Take... that!)  (You dick! That is for me, and that, that and that, that and that, that, that, that!) 
(Hm hm, noho, that's not what it means.)
(And it's time for us to come clean.) 
(Yeah.)  (It isn't fair I was so close to getting a blow job and I'll never get one now - this is fucking bullshit...) 
(How about we put a real fire out?)
What the hell is going on, you guys?
(And did you stick it in right when the fireplace gave you the shadow light?)
(It's when you take your finger, and you stick it in a vagina and you stick it in again and again.)
(Or are you gonna hit her with your hand?)
To wit, I have found nothing wrong with this remote place, and I must admit it will be with some melancholy that I will leave this island and return home.
I saw this chick in a bikini on the beach too. She had the nicest boobs ever.
Humbly yours, Kenneth.
(Hey, just accept Faith Hilling is out of style!)
All right, but you guys owe me for this.
(Hey, guys. Uh, check out this kick-ass cool costume.)
(I'm sorry guys. Faith Hilling is just a stupid fad, right?)
(Uh-oh.)  (Help me, Kyle! What are we gonna do?)
(You guys! You guys, oh shit, come check this out!) 
(Aw, it's okay, kid. It's not going to hurt.) 
With the war at an end, our Butters is able to have his hapa noa ceremony. And with any help from the gods, become his old cheery self again.
(Well, why do I have to be the one to go and find chicks?)
(Yeah, it was awesome! I was just sitting down and then I got my period!)
(Kyle, I'm gonna camp and watch the meteor shower. Do you wanna come and see it with me?)
(It means I'm gonna be pure and not have sex until I get married.)
(Yeah, I feel that she's a freakin' bitch!)
(If you wanna get high and jack off, it's cool.)
(Unngh. Stop, no! No, it's mine!)  (There! It's mine!) 
(Yeah. Tammy said if I got her the tickets for the concert, she would give me a B.J.!)
(Dude, these are my fucking food stamps! How am I going to eat without all these food stamps?)
(What?! No! What are you doing?!)  (You fuckers!) 
(Dude, what the fuck is so filthy or offensive in here?)
(Well, I'm gonna give my grandfather a full-body sensual massage.)
(I told you it was a bad idea.)
(Awww, don't be so mean. Butters is our friend, huh?) 
(Yeah! Take this, Professor Chaos!)  (Feel my wrath!) 
(Cartman's ass is so fuckin' huge that they could probably show six stupid films on it and still have some room, heheheheheh) 
(Hey, you guys, I'm a little bit be-)  (Oof.)
(Hey, can I have a drink of water?)
(Heheh, yeah. You're a faggot, dude. Fuck, yeah. Hehe-eheh.)
(Oh, I was so close! You should have seen those titties.)
(Excuse me, he needs to go to Hawaii.)
(Nahit chaim.)  (Ha! Hiheh haha.)  (Hah! Oh my God!)
(What?!)  (Oh, the nerve! How insensitive of you, you cock-sucking faggot!)
(Ready.)  (Oh,  shiiit. Damnit! Cartman, I've got to go to the bathroom!) 
The American government finally gave in to the natives and had the Mahalo Rewards cards reinstated. Our two cultures, it appears, will once again live in peace.
(The titties! Oh my god, they were incredible!)
(Well, I think you guys should name it Steve)
I don't know. I really don't give a shit.
(Fuck no, I wasn't looking at a handkerchief!)
(I just LOVE this jacket 'cause it's SOOO beautiful!)
(Mine is so fuckin' badass it's gotta win now!)
(Take off the ring? You can take off the ring??)  (Really?)
(I'm telling you, it's Kyle you want. He's the one who tried to get me in here, and you know it.)
(It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's operation-)
(Perhaps, he's just too big to get out of bed) 
(Hey, that's not fair! I got the fucking ticket!)  (Hey! What the heck!)
(Hey, you guys! You guys, I think I know precisely what it's saying. It says that we've gotta go and find a pile of records and get the one that has the entire lyrics, and then we gotta get into learning to rearrange them.)
(All right! Come on, let's get to the parking lot. Woo-hoo!) 
(No, I'm not going to fucking betray anybody!)
(Hey, that's odd.)  (Hey, I'm floating. That can't be! Hey wait!) 
(And I'm not gonna have last 5 days without death...) 
(You know what I think? Basically, if you let the decision of what you watch stop at the parents' control, then what can you see? It'll stay the same because they'll just get offended although their kids are not delighted with the television series they put on for their kids.)
(Mexico?! Why the heck do I have to take you all the way to Mexico?!)
(All right. How am I supposed to do that?)
(Yes! Woohoo! I did it! I reached level s-!) 
(I don't know. But I've gotta think of something.) 
(Oh no! I have got to stay away fro-aaagh!)  (Ugh!)
(What the hell? What the fuck is this?!) 
(Damn, I'd like to get a taste of her!)
(Because! His grandmother just died and her will says Cartman now has a million dollars!)
(Being poor has nothing to do with NASCAR!)
(No they don't wanna see a child die! You guys! Uf.)
(Yeah, and I got this nice marble sack to go with this carrot stick, see?)
(You guys! You guys, I did it! I got my very own period!)
My dear friends of the mainland,
What adventures I have found on the tiny island of Kava'i. I have truly become one with the natives, who found new courage to fight their oppressors.
(I guess the only thing I wish is to not die.)
(I don't know. It just seems kind of... mean)
(Are you fuckin' telling me that I could've fuckin' gone that way?!)
(Oh that fucking asshole!)  (Oh that fucking asshole, I'm gonna talk to him...)
(Mom, the cops are here! Mom, Dad, the cops are here!) 
{Maybe he took a dump and got sick.} 
(Heheheh. Now that's what I-he call a sticky situation!) 
Minna-san, sayonara! Ima, Purincessu Kenni tomodachi ni kaerimasu! 
(Yes I am! I've got the costume; it's waiting in the house! Yesterday I got this huge package in the mail, and it was big, okay?) 
(Hey you guys. Remember when Terrance and Phillip was off the air?)
(I'm not ruining my life, okay, you God damned fucking psychos.)
(Aww.)  (Okay, you guys, we've gotta get back to the camp and... )
(Hi guys.)  (Uh oh.)  (Uff. I'm okay.)  (I'm oKAAAYYYYYYY!!!) 
(No, I'm not young and I want a B.J.)
(Oh okay, okay, I just wanna sleep now.)
(Stop!)  (Officer Barbrady, I really need to talk to you!)  (Shit!)
(Waarrggh!!)  (Dude! You guys, I really, really don't have time to tell you that-- Argghh..!) 
(Uh oh. Hey uh, you guys! Help me doooowwwwnnnn! Heeyy, you guuuuyyyyys!) 
(Wait until you see what I can do to the dog!)
(Hey you guys, I talked to Garrison and he told me that they're almost the same.)
(Look, Mom. I just fixed you a drink.) 
(Oof. Oh this Goddamned freakin'-  AARGH  Goddamn, why-  Oh this freakin'-  AARGH  Phew.  Well, I'm fine, guys!  Now if I can- 
(Oh, there, there now. There's nothing to be afraid of, dear.) 
(That is the sickest thing I have ever fucking seen!)
(Sir, please, I'm supposed to get laid for the first time on Saturday.)
(I came here to kick your ass once and for all!)
(What the hell are we going to do?!)
(I just threw my ninja star at him.)
(They didn't put me at the bottom, did they?)
(This is not herpes, it's a cold sore!)
(Con Te Partirт?) (...Su navi per mariche, io lo so,no, no, non esistono piщ.con te io li rivivrт. 'Con te...)
(Shut the fuck up, dude! You're a fuckin' asshole!)
(Craig just asked me to do his show, geez.)
(What the fuck did you do that for?)
Stan and Kyle, you take the back entrance. Cartman and I will block him from the side.
(Dude, shut the fuck up about my house!)
(I said, Shut up, Cartman, you blood-belching vagina!)
(Come on, Squirts, we gotta run! We're already god-damned late!)
(You see? Look at all these piles of food. He must have been here for days!)
(When you rub your dick,
you might find a discharge that
winds up on the floor.)
(Oh, Grey's Anatomy. Cool! Oh man, this is a great DVD. We're gonna have the ... sex, yeah.)
(Oh you forgot to get some Judas Priest.)
(Welcome to my kingdom, Sir Eric. Now, state your purpose.)
(Well, there's gonna be a bunch of rats until they put the freakin' ceiling in.)
(No, swear to God it's true! Cartman's got a million dollars!)
(I agree. Let's put in this DVD and watch Grey's Anatomy.)
(You can change your mind instead of fighting with us, Eric.)
(Well,... ...and I can't take any of that!)
(Hey dude, I like to shave my balls.)
(Or look at the cat on her feet, then touch her.)
