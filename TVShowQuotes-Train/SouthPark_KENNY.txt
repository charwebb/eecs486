(Because they're trying to take over the world?)
(I think that Garrison said that gay people suck.)
(Yes I am! I've got the costume; it's waiting in the house! Yesterday I got this huge package in the mail, and it was big, okay?) 
(If you wanna get high and jack off, it's cool.)
(I'm sorry guys. Faith Hilling is just a stupid fad, right?)
(Damn, I'd like to get a taste of her!)
To wit, I have found nothing wrong with this remote place, and I must admit it will be with some melancholy that I will leave this island and return home.
I saw this chick in a bikini on the beach too. She had the nicest boobs ever.
Humbly yours, Kenneth.
(Nope, I'm okay.)  (It-aah. It hurts! IT HURTS!)  (Ugh.)
(You know what I think? Basically, if you let the decision of what you watch stop at the parents' control, then what can you see? It'll stay the same because they'll just get offended although their kids are not delighted with the television series they put on for their kids.)
(Cartman's ass is so fuckin' huge that they could probably show six stupid films on it and still have some room, heheheheheh) 
(Kyle, I'm gonna camp and watch the meteor shower. Do you wanna come and see it with me?)
(Well now, that does it! I have had enough of this bullshit! Screw you, Stan. I'm going home!) 
(Well, I'm gonna give my grandfather a full-body sensual massage.)
(Mom, the cops are here! Mom, Dad, the cops are here!) 
(You guys! You guys, I did it! I got my very own period!)
(Huh-uh, I ain't gonna get inside that ring! Aaah!) 
(Mexico?! Why the heck do I have to take you all the way to Mexico?!)
The American government finally gave in to the natives and had the Mahalo Rewards cards reinstated. Our two cultures, it appears, will once again live in peace.
(What the hell are we going to do?!)
(I guess the only thing I wish is to not die.)
(Oh no! I have got to stay away fro-aaagh!)  (Ugh!)
(Yes, I agree. I think Craig is a thousand times as cool as Clyde. There doesn't really seem to be a doubt.)
(Because! His grandmother just died and her will says Cartman now has a million dollars!)
(Hey you guys. Remember when Terrance and Phillip was off the air?)
(Yeah, I guess. I just wonder about McNuggets.)
(Aw, now don't say that. Poor little kid.)
(Oof. Oh this Goddamned freakin'-  AARGH  Goddamn, why-  Oh this freakin'-  AARGH  Phew.  Well, I'm fine, guys!  Now if I can- 
(And I'm not gonna have last 5 days without death...) 
(Yeah, it's like killing a dead pig and a turkey.) 
(I came here to kick your ass once and for all!)
(Excuse me, he needs to go to Hawaii.)
(Wait until you see what I can do to the dog!)
(What the hell? What the fuck is this?!) 
(I agree. Let's put in this DVD and watch Grey's Anatomy.)
All right, but you guys owe me for this.
(You see? Look at all these piles of food. He must have been here for days!)
(Hey, just accept Faith Hilling is out of style!)
(When you rub your dick,
you might find a discharge that
winds up on the floor.)
(Hey, can I have a drink of water?)
(I'm telling you, it's Kyle you want. He's the one who tried to get me in here, and you know it.)
(Oh that fucking asshole!)  (Oh that fucking asshole, I'm gonna talk to him...)
(Hm hm, noho, that's not what it means.)
(Waarrggh!!)  (Dude! You guys, I really, really don't have time to tell you that-- Argghh..!) 
(Dude, shut the fuck up about my house!)
(Shut the fuck up, dude! You're a fuckin' asshole!)
("And I want to see you handling your breasts.")
(And it's time for us to come clean.) 
(Heheheh. Now that's what I-he call a sticky situation!) 
(Cartman?! Cartman, you've gotta help me, and I'm not foolin' around!)
(Oh, Grey's Anatomy. Cool! Oh man, this is a great DVD. We're gonna have the ... sex, yeah.)
(Please, could you just let him on the plane? It's really important. Please?)
(It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's operation-)
(Hey, that's odd.)  (Hey, I'm floating. That can't be! Hey wait!) 
(Yeah, and I got this nice marble sack to go with this carrot stick, see?)
(I can't make love to you until we get a king-size bed!)
(You guys, I'm gonna try and win that costume contest!)
(Hey, you guys! You guys, I think I know precisely what it's saying. It says that we've gotta go and find a pile of records and get the one that has the entire lyrics, and then we gotta get into learning to rearrange them.)
(...partirт.Su navi per mariche, io lo so,no, no, non esistono piщ.)'(Io con te...!)
(Yeah, that's because you vomit on her all the time.) 
With the war at an end, our Butters is able to have his hapa noa ceremony. And with any help from the gods, become his old cheery self again.
(Awww, don't be so mean. Butters is our friend, huh?) 
(Hey you guys, I talked to Garrison and he told me that they're almost the same.)
(Aw, it's okay, kid. It's not going to hurt.) 
(Well, why the fuck do I have to do everything while you stand around in the snow lookin--) 
(Sir, please, I'm supposed to get laid for the first time on Saturday.)
(Yeah, it was awesome! I was just sitting down and then I got my period!)
(Yeah.)  (It isn't fair I was so close to getting a blow job and I'll never get one now - this is fucking bullshit...) 
(Yeah. Tammy said if I got her the tickets for the concert, she would give me a B.J.!)
(It's when you take your finger, and you stick it in a vagina and you stick it in again and again.)
(I don't know. It just seems kind of... mean)
(There's a lot of fuckin' vaginas and penises.)
(Well,... ...and I can't take any of that!)
(Oh you forgot to get some Judas Priest.)
(Or are you gonna hit her with your hand?)
(It's a giant stick that goes inside the mom's vagina) 
(What the fuck did you do that for?)
(How about we put a real fire out?)
(No they don't wanna see a child die! You guys! Uf.)
(Damn, I'd like to get a taste of her!)
(Heheh, yeah. You're a faggot, dude. Fuck, yeah. Hehe-eheh.)
(Yeah, I was kinda thinking we could go to TGI Friday's.)
Stan and Kyle, you take the back entrance. Cartman and I will block him from the side.
(Craig just asked me to do his show, geez.)
(Look, Mom. I just fixed you a drink.) 
(Take off the ring? You can take off the ring??)  (Really?)
My dearest friends.
I am living amongst the natives in the remote and tiny island of Kava'i. What can I tell you of this mysterious island and its people? It is a place of wonder, and yet to the outsider like me, a place of odd tradition. The people here are peaceful and joyous, and seem to care little for the rush and worry of the outside world. Their diet is mostly an odd mixture of coconut milk, pineapple juice, and vodka, which they call the chi-chi. As for Butters, he is quickly learning the ways of his ancestors, and seems to be feeling better with every passing day. He still seems quite angry at times, but luckily his ceremony will finally take place on the morrow.
(Oh okay, okay, I just wanna sleep now.)
(Being poor has nothing to do with NASCAR!)
{Maybe he took a dump and got sick.} 
(You guys! You guys, oh shit, come check this out!) 
(Hey you guys, wait up for me!)  (Waaah!) 
(Aww.)  (Okay, you guys, we've gotta get back to the camp and... )
(Come on, Squirts, we gotta run! We're already god-damned late!)
(You guys, come get this fucking magnet noooowwww!)  (Argh--!)
(Nahit chaim.)  (Ha! Hiheh haha.)  (Hah! Oh my God!)
(No, swear to God it's true! Cartman's got a million dollars!)
(Let's see... No, not there)  (Let's see. Nothing there)  (Let's see... here!) 
(I don't know. But I've gotta think of something.) 
(Or look at the cat on her feet, then touch her.)
(Stop!)  (Officer Barbrady, I really need to talk to you!)  (Shit!)
Minna-san, sayonara! Ima, Purincessu Kenni tomodachi ni kaerimasu! 
(See, a tampon is what you stick up your ass so you don't bleed.)
(Uh oh. Hey uh, you guys! Help me doooowwwwnnnn! Heeyy, you guuuuyyyyys!) 
(What?!)  (Oh, the nerve! How insensitive of you, you cock-sucking faggot!)
(I don't care. I've gotta get some protection.)
(Hey, you guys, I'm a little bit be-)  (Oof.)
(Hey, guys. Uh, check out this kick-ass cool costume.)
(Dude, these are my fucking food stamps! How am I going to eat without all these food stamps?)
(Welcome to my kingdom, Sir Eric. Now, state your purpose.)
(The titties! Oh my god, they were incredible!)
(Perhaps, he's just too big to get out of bed) 
(Yeah, I feel that she's a freakin' bitch!)
What the hell is going on, you guys?
(Ready.)  (Oh,  shiiit. Damnit! Cartman, I've got to go to the bathroom!) 
(Fuck no, I wasn't looking at a handkerchief!)
(No. All I could get was a couple of tampons.)
(No, I'm not young and I want a B.J.)
(I told you it was a bad idea.)
(They didn't put me at the bottom, did they?)
(Unngh. Stop, no! No, it's mine!)  (There! It's mine!) 
(Are you fuckin' telling me that I could've fuckin' gone that way?!)
I don't know. I really don't give a shit.
(Take... that!)  (You dick! That is for me, and that, that and that, that and that, that, that, that!) 
(Why the fuck does it have to be my tooth?)
(And did you stick it in right when the fireplace gave you the shadow light?)
(Uh-oh.)  (Help me, Kyle! What are we gonna do?)
(I just threw my ninja star at him.)
(Oh, there, there now. There's nothing to be afraid of, dear.) 
(That is the sickest thing I have ever fucking seen!)
(Well, see you guys. I gotta go take the bus out of town.)
(Yes! Woohoo! I did it! I reached level s-!) 
(Mine is so fuckin' badass it's gotta win now!)
(Oh, I was so close! You should have seen those titties.)
(Dude, what the fuck is so filthy or offensive in here?)
(To pay for the pockets on his peehole) 
(No, I'm not going to fucking betray anybody!)
(I'm not ruining my life, okay, you God damned fucking psychos.)
(Well, I think you guys should name it Steve)
(Hey, that's not fair! I got the fucking ticket!)  (Hey! What the heck!)
(Well, there's gonna be a bunch of rats until they put the freakin' ceiling in.)
(All right. How am I supposed to do that?)
(Con Te Partirт?) (...Su navi per mariche, io lo so,no, no, non esistono piщ.con te io li rivivrт. 'Con te...)
(Hi guys.)  (Uh oh.)  (Uff. I'm okay.)  (I'm oKAAAYYYYYYY!!!) 
(What?! No! What are you doing?!)  (You fuckers!)
