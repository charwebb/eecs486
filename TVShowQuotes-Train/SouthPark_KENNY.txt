(Yeah, it was awesome! I was just sitting down and then I got my period!)

(No, I'm not going to fucking betray anybody!)

(Oh you forgot to get some Judas Priest.)

(It's when you take your finger, and you stick it in a vagina and you stick it in again and again.)

(Heheheh. Now that's what I-he call a sticky situation!) 

("And I want to see you handling your breasts.")

(I don't know. It just seems kind of... mean)

(Huh-uh, I ain't gonna get inside that ring! Aaah!) 

(Hey, that's odd.)  (Hey, I'm floating. That can't be! Hey wait!) 

(No, I'm not young and I want a B.J.)

(Dude, what the fuck is so filthy or offensive in here?)

(Cartman's ass is so fuckin' huge that they could probably show six stupid films on it and still have some room, heheheheheh) 

(It's a giant stick that goes inside the mom's vagina) 

(Aw, it's okay, kid. It's not going to hurt.) 

(It means I'm gonna be pure and not have sex until I get married.)

(Oh okay, okay, I just wanna sleep now.)

(Wait until you see what I can do to the dog!)

(Hi guys.)  (Uh oh.)  (Uff. I'm okay.)  (I'm oKAAAYYYYYYY!!!) 

(Oh that fucking asshole!)  (Oh that fucking asshole, I'm gonna talk to him...)

(Aw, now don't say that. Poor little kid.)

(What the fuck did you do that for?)

(Take... that!)  (You dick! That is for me, and that, that and that, that and that, that, that, that!) 

(This is not herpes, it's a cold sore!)

(Hey, can I have a drink of water?)

(And then we gotta go down and get a piece of paper and write down each one of the words we sang on the tape deck. And then, sing it back again!)

(Being poor has nothing to do with NASCAR!)

To wit, I have found nothing wrong with this remote place, and I must admit it will be with some melancholy that I will leave this island and return home.
I saw this chick in a bikini on the beach too. She had the nicest boobs ever.
Humbly yours, Kenneth.

(I can't make love to you until we get a king-size bed!)

(Dude, these are my fucking food stamps! How am I going to eat without all these food stamps?)

(Well, see you guys. I gotta go take the bus out of town.)

I don't know. I really don't give a shit.

(There's a lot of fuckin' vaginas and penises.)

(Oh, I was so close! You should have seen those titties.)

(No. All I could get was a couple of tampons.)

(I did! I was really excited to get a B.J. but now I have to wear this motherfucking purity ring!)

{Maybe he took a dump and got sick.} 

(Hey, you guys, I'm a little bit be-)  (Oof.)

(Look, Mom. I just fixed you a drink.) 

(How about we put a real fire out?)

(Yes I am! I've got the costume; it's waiting in the house! Yesterday I got this huge package in the mail, and it was big, okay?) 

(The titties! Oh my god, they were incredible!)

My dear friends of the mainland,
What adventures I have found on the tiny island of Kava'i. I have truly become one with the natives, who found new courage to fight their oppressors.

(I'm sorry guys. Faith Hilling is just a stupid fad, right?)

(Mine is so fuckin' badass it's gotta win now!)

(Hey, you guys! You guys, I think I know precisely what it's saying. It says that we've gotta go and find a pile of records and get the one that has the entire lyrics, and then we gotta get into learning to rearrange them.)

(Well now, that does it! I have had enough of this bullshit! Screw you, Stan. I'm going home!) 

(Uh oh. Hey uh, you guys! Help me doooowwwwnnnn! Heeyy, you guuuuyyyyys!) 

(What?! No! What are you doing?!)  (You fuckers!) 

(Damn, I'd like to get a taste of her!)

(Con Te Partirт?) (...Su navi per mariche, io lo so,no, no, non esistono piщ.con te io li rivivrт. 'Con te...)

(Nahit chaim.)  (Ha! Hiheh haha.)  (Hah! Oh my God!)

(Ready.)  (Oh,  shiiit. Damnit! Cartman, I've got to go to the bathroom!) 

(Take off the ring? You can take off the ring??)  (Really?)

(I don't know. But I've gotta think of something.) 

(I'm telling you, it's Kyle you want. He's the one who tried to get me in here, and you know it.)

(Hey, guys. Uh, check out this kick-ass cool costume.)

(Hey you guys, wait up for me!)  (Waaah!) 

(Excuse me, he needs to go to Hawaii.)

(Or look at the cat on her feet, then touch her.)

(No they don't wanna see a child die! You guys! Uf.)

(I told you it was a bad idea.)

(Oof. Oh this Goddamned freakin'-  AARGH  Goddamn, why-  Oh this freakin'-  AARGH  Phew.  Well, I'm fine, guys!  Now if I can- 

(They didn't put me at the bottom, did they?)

(Oh no! I have got to stay away fro-aaagh!)  (Ugh!)

(When you rub your dick,
you might find a discharge that
winds up on the floor.)

(Hey dude, I like to shave my balls.)

(Heheh, yeah. You're a faggot, dude. Fuck, yeah. Hehe-eheh.)

(Dude, maybe he's like mentally ill or something)

(Yeah, and I got this nice marble sack to go with this carrot stick, see?)

(Uh-oh.)  (Help me, Kyle! What are we gonna do?)

(Come on, Squirts, we gotta run! We're already god-damned late!)

(Well, why do I have to be the one to go and find chicks?)

(Hey you guys. Remember when Terrance and Phillip was off the air?)

(I agree. Let's put in this DVD and watch Grey's Anatomy.)

(Because! His grandmother just died and her will says Cartman now has a million dollars!)

(Well,... ...and I can't take any of that!)

(If you wanna get high and jack off, it's cool.)

(I guess the only thing I wish is to not die.)

(Well, why the fuck do I have to do everything while you stand around in the snow lookin--) 

(You know what I think? Basically, if you let the decision of what you watch stop at the parents' control, then what can you see? It'll stay the same because they'll just get offended although their kids are not delighted with the television series they put on for their kids.)

(Well, there's gonna be a bunch of rats until they put the freakin' ceiling in.)

(You can change your mind instead of fighting with us, Eric.)

(Yeah, I feel that she's a freakin' bitch!)

(Cartman?! Cartman, you've gotta help me, and I'm not foolin' around!)

Stan and Kyle, you take the back entrance. Cartman and I will block him from the side.

(You see? Look at all these piles of food. He must have been here for days!)

(You guys, I'm gonna try and win that costume contest!)

(Nope, I'm okay.)  (It-aah. It hurts! IT HURTS!)  (Ugh.)

(Kyle, I'm gonna camp and watch the meteor shower. Do you wanna come and see it with me?)

(Hey you guys, I talked to Garrison and he told me that they're almost the same.)

The American government finally gave in to the natives and had the Mahalo Rewards cards reinstated. Our two cultures, it appears, will once again live in peace.

(Hey, just accept Faith Hilling is out of style!)

(Because they're trying to take over the world?)

(...partirт.Su navi per mariche, io lo so,no, no, non esistono piщ.)'(Io con te...!)

(Yeah! Take this, Professor Chaos!)  (Feel my wrath!) 

(Please, could you just let him on the plane? It's really important. Please?)

(And did you stick it in right when the fireplace gave you the shadow light?)

(Stop!)  (Officer Barbrady, I really need to talk to you!)  (Shit!)

(What the hell? What the fuck is this?!) 

(Hm hm, noho, that's not what it means.)

What the hell is going on, you guys?

(All right! Come on, let's get to the parking lot. Woo-hoo!) 

(Oh, Grey's Anatomy. Cool! Oh man, this is a great DVD. We're gonna have the ... sex, yeah.)

Minna-san, sayonara! Ima, Purincessu Kenni tomodachi ni kaerimasu! 

(I think if we run, try to get Eric to drop his tea)

(Yeah. Tammy said if I got her the tickets for the concert, she would give me a B.J.!)

(And it's time for us to come clean.) 

(All I know is that it was a loong time ago, and Death was chasing us on a bicycle down the street.)

(What?!)  (Oh, the nerve! How insensitive of you, you cock-sucking faggot!)

With the war at an end, our Butters is able to have his hapa noa ceremony. And with any help from the gods, become his old cheery self again.

(Mexico?! Why the heck do I have to take you all the way to Mexico?!)

(See, a tampon is what you stick up your ass so you don't bleed.)

(I just threw my ninja star at him.)

(Mom, the cops are here! Mom, Dad, the cops are here!) 

(Aww.)  (Okay, you guys, we've gotta get back to the camp and... )

(That is the sickest thing I have ever fucking seen!)

(You never seem to care when I die!)

(Yeah, I was kinda thinking we could go to TGI Friday's.)

(I don't care. I've gotta get some protection.)

(Awww, don't be so mean. Butters is our friend, huh?) 

(Hey, that's not fair! I got the fucking ticket!)  (Hey! What the heck!)

(Yeah, I guess. I just wonder about McNuggets.)

(To pay for the pockets on his peehole) 

(Unngh. Stop, no! No, it's mine!)  (There! It's mine!) 

(Waarrggh!!)  (Dude! You guys, I really, really don't have time to tell you that-- Argghh..!) 

(Well, I'm gonna give my grandfather a full-body sensual massage.)

(And I'm not gonna have last 5 days without death...) 

(Welcome to my kingdom, Sir Eric. Now, state your purpose.)

(Let's see... No, not there)  (Let's see. Nothing there)  (Let's see... here!) 

(I just LOVE this jacket 'cause it's SOOO beautiful!)

(I came here to kick your ass once and for all!)

(Fuck no, I wasn't looking at a handkerchief!)

(It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's operation-)

(Shut the fuck up, dude! You're a fuckin' asshole!)

(Or are you gonna hit her with your hand?)

(I said, Shut up, Cartman, you blood-belching vagina!)

(Sir, please, I'm supposed to get laid for the first time on Saturday.)

(Craig just asked me to do his show, geez.)

(What the hell are we going to do?!)

(Damn, I'd like to get a taste of her!)

(Yes, I agree. I think Craig is a thousand times as cool as Clyde. There doesn't really seem to be a doubt.)

(I think that Garrison said that gay people suck.)

(Why the fuck does it have to be my tooth?)

All right, but you guys owe me for this.
