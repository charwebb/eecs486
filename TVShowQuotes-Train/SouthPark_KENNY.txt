(Hey, guys. Uh, check out this kick-ass cool costume.)
(That is the sickest thing I have ever fucking seen!)
(It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's operation-)
(Craig just asked me to do his show, geez.)
(Oh that fucking asshole!)  (Oh that fucking asshole, I'm gonna talk to him...)
(Hey dude, I like to shave my balls.)
(You guys! You guys, oh shit, come check this out!) 
(Nahit chaim.)  (Ha! Hiheh haha.)  (Hah! Oh my God!)
(Uh oh. Hey uh, you guys! Help me doooowwwwnnnn! Heeyy, you guuuuyyyyys!) 
(Mine is so fuckin' badass it's gotta win now!)
(Damn, I'd like to get a taste of her!)
(Ready.)  (Oh,  shiiit. Damnit! Cartman, I've got to go to the bathroom!) 
{Maybe he took a dump and got sick.} 
(The titties! Oh my god, they were incredible!)
(What the fuck did you do that for?)
(Hey you guys, wait up for me!)  (Waaah!) 
(If you wanna get high and jack off, it's cool.)
(Yes, I agree. I think Craig is a thousand times as cool as Clyde. There doesn't really seem to be a doubt.)
(Or look at the cat on her feet, then touch her.)
(Wait until you see what I can do to the dog!)
All right, but you guys owe me for this.
(Well, there's gonna be a bunch of rats until they put the freakin' ceiling in.)
(Yeah! Take this, Professor Chaos!)  (Feel my wrath!) 
(Uh-oh.)  (Help me, Kyle! What are we gonna do?)
(Kyle, I'm gonna camp and watch the meteor shower. Do you wanna come and see it with me?)
(I think if we run, try to get Eric to drop his tea)
(And did you stick it in right when the fireplace gave you the shadow light?)
(Come on, Squirts, we gotta run! We're already god-damned late!)
(No they don't wanna see a child die! You guys! Uf.)
(Mexico?! Why the heck do I have to take you all the way to Mexico?!)
(Awww, don't be so mean. Butters is our friend, huh?) 
(To pay for the pockets on his peehole) 
(There's a lot of fuckin' vaginas and penises.)
(What the hell? What the fuck is this?!) 
(Shut the fuck up, dude! You're a fuckin' asshole!)
My dear friends of the mainland,
What adventures I have found on the tiny island of Kava'i. I have truly become one with the natives, who found new courage to fight their oppressors.
(Fuck no, I wasn't looking at a handkerchief!)
(How about we put a real fire out?)
(Cartman's ass is so fuckin' huge that they could probably show six stupid films on it and still have some room, heheheheheh) 
The American government finally gave in to the natives and had the Mahalo Rewards cards reinstated. Our two cultures, it appears, will once again live in peace.
What the hell is going on, you guys?
(Being poor has nothing to do with NASCAR!)
(Well, why the fuck do I have to do everything while you stand around in the snow lookin--) 
My dearest friends.
I am living amongst the natives in the remote and tiny island of Kava'i. What can I tell you of this mysterious island and its people? It is a place of wonder, and yet to the outsider like me, a place of odd tradition. The people here are peaceful and joyous, and seem to care little for the rush and worry of the outside world. Their diet is mostly an odd mixture of coconut milk, pineapple juice, and vodka, which they call the chi-chi. As for Butters, he is quickly learning the ways of his ancestors, and seems to be feeling better with every passing day. He still seems quite angry at times, but luckily his ceremony will finally take place on the morrow.
(Oh, I was so close! You should have seen those titties.)
(Oh, there, there now. There's nothing to be afraid of, dear.) 
(Let's see... No, not there)  (Let's see. Nothing there)  (Let's see... here!) 
To wit, I have found nothing wrong with this remote place, and I must admit it will be with some melancholy that I will leave this island and return home.
I saw this chick in a bikini on the beach too. She had the nicest boobs ever.
Humbly yours, Kenneth.
(Oh, Grey's Anatomy. Cool! Oh man, this is a great DVD. We're gonna have the ... sex, yeah.)
(They didn't put me at the bottom, did they?)
(Aw, now don't say that. Poor little kid.)
(See, a tampon is what you stick up your ass so you don't bleed.)
(All I know is that it was a loong time ago, and Death was chasing us on a bicycle down the street.)
(I can't make love to you until we get a king-size bed!)
(Hey, that's not fair! I got the fucking ticket!)  (Hey! What the heck!)
(Why the fuck does it have to be my tooth?)
(No. All I could get was a couple of tampons.)
(Hey, you guys, I'm a little bit be-)  (Oof.)
(You guys, I'm gonna try and win that costume contest!)
I don't know. I really don't give a shit.
(I just threw my ninja star at him.)
(Con Te Partirт?) (...Su navi per mariche, io lo so,no, no, non esistono piщ.con te io li rivivrт. 'Con te...)
(Yeah. Tammy said if I got her the tickets for the concert, she would give me a B.J.!)
(Perhaps, he's just too big to get out of bed) 
(Dude, shut the fuck up about my house!)
(I don't care. I've gotta get some protection.)
(Well now, that does it! I have had enough of this bullshit! Screw you, Stan. I'm going home!) 
(Damn, I'd like to get a taste of her!)
(Mom, the cops are here! Mom, Dad, the cops are here!) 
With the war at an end, our Butters is able to have his hapa noa ceremony. And with any help from the gods, become his old cheery self again.
(Yeah, I guess. I just wonder about McNuggets.)
(And I'm not gonna have last 5 days without death...) 
(Take off the ring? You can take off the ring??)  (Really?)
(Oof. Oh this Goddamned freakin'-  AARGH  Goddamn, why-  Oh this freakin'-  AARGH  Phew.  Well, I'm fine, guys!  Now if I can- 
(I'm sorry guys. Faith Hilling is just a stupid fad, right?)
(Sir, please, I'm supposed to get laid for the first time on Saturday.)
(Yeah, I was kinda thinking we could go to TGI Friday's.)
(You see? Look at all these piles of food. He must have been here for days!)
(Yeah, it was awesome! I was just sitting down and then I got my period!)
(Well, why do I have to be the one to go and find chicks?)
(Hey, can I have a drink of water?)
(Oh okay, okay, I just wanna sleep now.)
(No, swear to God it's true! Cartman's got a million dollars!)
(Dude, maybe he's like mentally ill or something)
(You can change your mind instead of fighting with us, Eric.)
(I guess the only thing I wish is to not die.)
(Huh-uh, I ain't gonna get inside that ring! Aaah!) 
(Or are you gonna hit her with your hand?)
(And then we gotta go down and get a piece of paper and write down each one of the words we sang on the tape deck. And then, sing it back again!)
(I said, Shut up, Cartman, you blood-belching vagina!)
(I don't know. But I've gotta think of something.) 
(Hm hm, noho, that's not what it means.)
(All right! Come on, let's get to the parking lot. Woo-hoo!) 
(Hey, that's odd.)  (Hey, I'm floating. That can't be! Hey wait!) 
(I told you it was a bad idea.)
(It's a giant stick that goes inside the mom's vagina) 
(Hey you guys. Remember when Terrance and Phillip was off the air?)
(Well, I'm gonna give my grandfather a full-body sensual massage.)
Minna-san, sayonara! Ima, Purincessu Kenni tomodachi ni kaerimasu! 
(All right. How am I supposed to do that?)
(Hi guys.)  (Uh oh.)  (Uff. I'm okay.)  (I'm oKAAAYYYYYYY!!!) 
(When you rub your dick,
you might find a discharge that
winds up on the floor.)
(You guys! You guys, I did it! I got my very own period!)
(I did! I was really excited to get a B.J. but now I have to wear this motherfucking purity ring!)
(Heheheh. Now that's what I-he call a sticky situation!) 
(Please, could you just let him on the plane? It's really important. Please?)
(Yeah, I feel that she's a freakin' bitch!)
(I'm not ruining my life, okay, you God damned fucking psychos.)
(Because! His grandmother just died and her will says Cartman now has a million dollars!)
(...partirт.Su navi per mariche, io lo so,no, no, non esistono piщ.)'(Io con te...!)
(No, I'm not young and I want a B.J.)
(Take... that!)  (You dick! That is for me, and that, that and that, that and that, that, that, that!) 
(It means I'm gonna be pure and not have sex until I get married.)
(Yeah, that's because you vomit on her all the time.) 
("And I want to see you handling your breasts.")
(Hey you guys, I talked to Garrison and he told me that they're almost the same.)
(Excuse me, he needs to go to Hawaii.)
(Stop!)  (Officer Barbrady, I really need to talk to you!)  (Shit!)
(Yes! Woohoo! I did it! I reached level s-!) 
(I just LOVE this jacket 'cause it's SOOO beautiful!)
(Well, see you guys. I gotta go take the bus out of town.)
(Yeah, it's like killing a dead pig and a turkey.) 
(No, I'm not going to fucking betray anybody!)
Stan and Kyle, you take the back entrance. Cartman and I will block him from the side.
(Nope, I'm okay.)  (It-aah. It hurts! IT HURTS!)  (Ugh.)
(Oh you forgot to get some Judas Priest.)
(You never seem to care when I die!)
(Because they're trying to take over the world?)
(Cartman?! Cartman, you've gotta help me, and I'm not foolin' around!)
(Yeah.)  (It isn't fair I was so close to getting a blow job and I'll never get one now - this is fucking bullshit...) 
(Waarrggh!!)  (Dude! You guys, I really, really don't have time to tell you that-- Argghh..!) 
(Hey, just accept Faith Hilling is out of style!)
(Dude, these are my fucking food stamps! How am I going to eat without all these food stamps?)
(Look, Mom. I just fixed you a drink.) 
(And it's time for us to come clean.) 
(Are you fuckin' telling me that I could've fuckin' gone that way?!)
(Welcome to my kingdom, Sir Eric. Now, state your purpose.)
(Aww.)  (Okay, you guys, we've gotta get back to the camp and... )
(Yes I am! I've got the costume; it's waiting in the house! Yesterday I got this huge package in the mail, and it was big, okay?) 
(Hey, you guys! You guys, I think I know precisely what it's saying. It says that we've gotta go and find a pile of records and get the one that has the entire lyrics, and then we gotta get into learning to rearrange them.)
(You know what I think? Basically, if you let the decision of what you watch stop at the parents' control, then what can you see? It'll stay the same because they'll just get offended although their kids are not delighted with the television series they put on for their kids.)
(Heheh, yeah. You're a faggot, dude. Fuck, yeah. Hehe-eheh.)
(Well,... ...and I can't take any of that!)
(You guys, come get this fucking magnet noooowwww!)  (Argh--!)
