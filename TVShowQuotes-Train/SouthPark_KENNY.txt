(Me??)

(Oh my God!)  (Owww!) 

(Yeah dude, I fucked you up.)

(Hunh?) 

(Plenty. This is 'cause my family's poor.)

(I could get to level sixty!)

(Wait until you see what I can do to the dog!)

(Here.) 

(What? Hey, let go.)

(Oof. Oh this Goddamned freakin'-  AARGH  Goddamn, why-  Oh this freakin'-  AARGH  Phew.  Well, I'm fine, guys!  Now if I can-

(But I wanna play now!)

(Woohoo!)

(Oh, no kidding.)

(I am. He's right here.) 

(Hey, Tammy!)

(Oh yeah!) 

(Hey!)  (Hey!)

(I don't know.)

(Woohoo!)

(Whoa, dude.)

(Hey!)

(No. All I could get was a couple of tampons.)

(AAAAHH!)

(Sir, please, I'm supposed to get laid for the first time on Saturday.)

(No I don't! Thank you.)

(Thanks, Stan.)

(I almost... touched them.)

(Yes. That's right.) 

(Cartman?! Cartman, you've gotta help me, and I'm not foolin' around!)

(Yeah! Take this, Professor Chaos!)  (Feel my wrath!) 

(Roger.)

(Yeah. Tammy said if I got her the tickets for the concert, she would give me a B.J.!)

(Damn!)

(Woohoo!)

(What? Is it?)

(Yeah, they totally kick ass at spanking!)

(Yeah!)

(Nononono-yikes!)

(Awesome, dude!)

(Are you serious?!)

(All right!)

(No you fucking don't!)

(No!)

(Ow!)

(Why the fuck does it have to be my tooth?)

(Uheheheheh, that's stupid.)

(And me!)

(Yeah.)

(Well now, that does it! I have had enough of this bullshit! Screw you, Stan. I'm going home!) 

(Nahit chaim.)  (Ha! Hiheh haha.)  (Hah! Oh my God!)

(Woohoo!)  (Heeheehee!!) 

(Aww, it's okay, little fella.)

(Hunh?)

(Aw, it's okay, kid. It's not going to hurt.) 

(Goodbbyyyyee-ugh!)

(Uh-huh.)

(FIVE BUCKS???) 

(No, no.)

(What do we do now?)

(Woohoohoo!)

(Yes, I agree. I think Craig is a thousand times as cool as Clyde. There doesn't really seem to be a doubt.)

(Oh, no!) 

(Aa-choo!)

(Uh huh.)

(Oh yeah! Woohoo!)

(This will be awesome!)

(Hey yeah!)

(Look, they're nothing, but...)

(Okay.) 

(Guuyys! Could you please make it stoopp?!!)

I don't know. I really don't give a shit.

(I'm sorry guys. Faith Hilling is just a stupid fad, right?)

(Oh. Flutes are gay?)

(It means I'm gonna be pure and not have sex until I get married.)

(N-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O!) 

(No way!)

(What the fuck is that?!)

(You guys! You guys, oh shit, come check this out!)

(Perhaps, he's just too big to get out of bed) 

(WHAT?!)

(What?!)

(I would do anything!) 

(Woohoo!!) 

(All right!)

(Yeah.)

('Cause, dude, I'll fuckin' die!)

(What the fuck are you doing here?!)

(Really?)

(Woohoo! Oh man!)

(We've gotta bring somebody else on.)

(Nuh-uh.)

(Yeah dude, I looove NASCAR.)

(Oh fuck I'm gettin' out of here!) 

(Ow.)

(Eric! Eric!)

(I'm not his best friend.)

(It's not that's fucking serious.) 

(Ungh.) 

(Because they're trying to take over the world?)

(Hey, can I have a drink of water?)

(Yaaayaya.)

Ptui. 

(Nooo!!) 

(And they're all shot.) 

(Hmmm. What the fuck?) 

(Kenny McCormick.)

(No! This is mine!)

(Woohoo!) 

(What?)  (Where'd she go?) 

(Here you go.)  (No way!) 

(If you wanna get high and jack off, it's cool.)

(What??)

(...Ten bucks!)

(Okay, try to get closer!)

(I just LOVE this jacket 'cause it's SOOO beautiful!)

(What?!)  (Oh, the nerve! How insensitive of you, you cock-sucking faggot!)

(I don't see anything.)

(Craig just asked me to do his show, geez.)

(They're the biggest breasts that I've seen)

(Okay.)

(Look at that!  What's he doin'?)

(Well, why the fuck do I have to do everything while you stand around in the snow lookin--) 

(Yeah)

(I don't know.)

(I came here to kick your ass once and for all!)

(Uh oh.)

(Woohoo!!)

(Commentary?)

Aren't I too big to be Blanket?

(I'll be there, Karen.) 

(Damn, I'd like to get a taste of her!)

(What?)

(Heheh, yeah. You're a faggot, dude. Fuck, yeah. Hehe-eheh.)

Quack-quack.

(Woohoo!) 

(I'm doing my homework.)

(Please, could you just let him on the plane? It's really important. Please?)

(Yeah, totally!)

(That's what that means!)

(You guys! You guys, over here! ...Hey!)

(Shop class?)  (No, I won't!)

(Awww, don't be so mean. Butters is our friend, huh?) 

(I just threw my ninja star at him.)

(Woohoo!) 

(Oh, God damn it!)

(Awesome)

(Hey guys, come here.)

(A purity ring.)

(Woo hoo!)

(...partirт.Su navi per mariche, io lo so,no, no, non esistono piщ.)'(Io con te...!)

(Wow, that is awesome!)

(Me too.)

(Yeah.)  (It isn't fair I was so close to getting a blow job and I'll never get one now - this is fucking bullshit...) 

(Maybe she'll suck my dick)

(Blue.)

(They're gonna hurt our chances.)

(Aaaargh!)

(God-damn, it stinks like shit!)

Purincessu Kenni reporuto! 

(Shut the fuck up, dude! You're a fuckin' asshole!)

(Me too.) 

(Me too.)

(All right! Come on, let's get to the parking lot. Woo-hoo!) 

(Yeah.)

(What?!)

(He actually killed it!)

(Stacey Anderson?) 

(Argh! That's just so untrue.)

(Heeeeyyyy, kick ass)  (Ow!) 

(Well I don't know.) 

(And I'm not gonna have last 5 days without death...) 

(Hi, Mr. Adler.)

(unintelligible)

(I have to go pee.)

(Huh? Uh.)  (AAAAAA!)  (Ufff!)  (Ugh!)

(I swear too.)

(Hey you guys, wait up for me!)  (Waaah!) 

(Just face it, dude, your uncle's stupid!)

(Autoerotic asphyxiation? What's that?)

(Oh okay, okay, I just wanna sleep now.)

My dearest friends.
I am living amongst the natives in the remote and tiny island of Kava'i. What can I tell you of this mysterious island and its people? It is a place of wonder, and yet to the outsider like me, a place of odd tradition. The people here are peaceful and joyous, and seem to care little for the rush and worry of the outside world. Their diet is mostly an odd mixture of coconut milk, pineapple juice, and vodka, which they call the chi-chi. As for Butters, he is quickly learning the ways of his ancestors, and seems to be feeling better with every passing day. He still seems quite angry at times, but luckily his ceremony will finally take place on the morrow.

(Okay.) 

Yeah, sure, whatever. 

(Dude, maybe he's like mentally ill or something)

(Not yet) 

(Giant Douche! Vote for him!)

(I think so too.)

(Yeah, we've been talking.)

(Take off the ring? You can take off the ring??)  (Really?)

(Oh, there, there now. There's nothing to be afraid of, dear.) 

(Son of a stinking bitch!)

(Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha) 

(Look, Mom. I just fixed you a drink.) 

(You never seem to care when I die!)

(That guy would try anything)

(Hi, Cartman.)

(Woohoo!)

What's going on, Kyle?

(Yeah.)

(Yeah.)

(A what?)

(Hello!)

(Woo-hoo!)

(You what?)

(When you rub your dick,
you might find a discharge that
winds up on the floor.)

(What the hell? What the fuck is this?!) 

(AH!)

(Yeah.)

(What?!)

(Ow.)

(No. Fuckin' Madonna...) 

(Yeah!)

(Yes! Woohoo! I did it! I reached level s-!) 

(Well, I'm gonna give my grandfather a full-body sensual massage.)

(Hey, guys!)  (Heey-ungh)  (Oowww.)

(We're almost there!)

(Wazzup? Ho-Ho! Wooooooo!)

(Wooo!) 

(Huh. Huh??)  (That does it!) 

(What are you gonna do?)

(Oh no! I have got to stay away fro-aaagh!)  (Ugh!)

(Yeah, and I got this nice marble sack to go with this carrot stick, see?)

(A party?!)

Yeah, Stan?

(Oh- ooowww!)

(Hoh!)

(Aa-choo!)

(NO.)

(Yeah, it's fucking crazy!)

(Okay.)

(Hey, you guys. I'm right here.)

(No.)

(Oh, I've just been hanging out.)

(Woohooo!) 

(Huh?)

(This is Eric Cartman.)

(Mhm.)

Mmmmmm! 

(Nope, I'm okay.)  (It-aah. It hurts! IT HURTS!)  (Ugh.)

(Woo-hoo!!) 

(What's a great idea?)

(Well, I think you guys should name it Steve)

(Aww, come on!)

(Get him!)

(Nuh-uh.)

(I said, Shut up, Cartman, you blood-belching vagina!)

(Aw, now don't say that. Poor little kid.)

(Yeah.) 

(Fuck no, I wasn't looking at a handkerchief!)

(Yeah.)

(I'll stick 'em together)

(A big mutant Stan?!)

(Well,... ...and I can't take any of that!)

('Cause girls like shaved balls.)

(Get the fuck off of me!)

(Yeah, how the fuck is that?!)

(Aww, that's bullshit!)

Yes. We saw their faces.

(That sounds totally fuckin' stupid.)

(All right. How am I supposed to do that?)

(Ugh!)

(Dude! What the fuck!)

(Yeah!)

(Yehes!)

(What are we gonna do?)

(Yeah, what's her name?)

(Oh my God, they've killed Cartman!)

(Yeah. Screw this crap!) 

(Yeah...)

(Hey you guys, look.) 

(Aahhh!)

(Come on, Squirts, we gotta run! We're already god-damned late!)

(This isn't a prank, Kyle!)

(Dude, it's just a fever blister!)

(I'm all right)

(Woohoo!  Woohoooo!)

(Yeah!)

(Don't worry, I'm alright. Argh!) 

(Hey.)

(All I know is that it was a loong time ago, and Death was chasing us on a bicycle down the street.)

(What the fuck for?!)

(Fuck yeah!)

(This is fucking ridiculous.)

(Con te...)

(Hehyayaya hehyayaya!)

(Uh huh.)

(Awww.)

(Hey guys, what's going on with you?)

(Hey dude, I like to shave my balls.)

(Yes I am! I've got the costume; it's waiting in the house! Yesterday I got this huge package in the mail, and it was big, okay?) 

(It's fucking disgusting!)

(I don't know!)

(What?!)

(Uh oh.)

(I told you it was a bad idea.)

(Good.) 

(No!)

(Or are you gonna hit her with your hand?)

(Heeeeeyah! Ugh--!) 

(Hey, guys. Uh, check out this kick-ass cool costume.)

(Um...) 

(What do you mean?)

Nohoho! No, not the socks! Ahhhgh, stop!

(Thanks.) 

(Ehe, that makes you very fucking gay.)

(What? Fuck you!)

(Hello, Chef.)

(Uh-huh.) 

(So?)

(No, he's telling the truth) 

(I know.)

(Yes, I believe we do.)

(Yeah! How cool!)

(Hey, dude.)

(Yeah!) 

(Yeah, I was kinda thinking we could go to TGI Friday's.)

(Excuse me, he needs to go to Hawaii.)

(Look at me! Look at me!)

(Butters!)

(Ach) 

(God damn it, someone help me!)

(Yeah, I feel that she's a freakin' bitch!)

(Huh-uh, I ain't gonna get inside that ring! Aaah!) 

(Derrr!)

(Fuck you!)

(Thanks.) 

(That I what?)

(Mom, the cops are here! Mom, Dad, the cops are here!) 

(Woohoo!)

(I don't know where he went!)

(That's awesome) 

(Like what?)

(All right. I'm fine.)

(How big's your penis, Chef?)

(Yeah.)

(The Make-A-Wish Foundation?)

(Ohhhhh, look!)  (You guys!)

(Hey, what's that?)

(No! Nono! No! Don't do this! Nononooo!) 

(Like what?)

(Right. What the fuck is going on?)

(What?)

(There's a lot of fuckin' vaginas and penises.)

(All right! I know!)

(Well, there's gonna be a bunch of rats until they put the freakin' ceiling in.)

(I don't wanna take shop class!) 

(Me?)

(Where am I?)

(What the fuck did you do that for?)

(Red Lobster!)

(I'm not ruining my life, okay, you God damned fucking psychos.)

(You see? Look at all these piles of food. He must have been here for days!)

(But Stan and Kyle are best friends)

(Uh-huh) 

(Yep.)

To wit, I have found nothing wrong with this remote place, and I must admit it will be with some melancholy that I will leave this island and return home.
I saw this chick in a bikini on the beach too. She had the nicest boobs ever.
Humbly yours, Kenneth.

(A football machine?)

(Yeah, fuck him!)

(Yeah, totally awesome!)

(What?!) 

(Shuriken. Awesome!)

(Dude, what the fuck are you doing?!)

(...partirт.)

(Yup! I see it in the drift.)

(Hi guys.)  (Uh oh.)  (Uff. I'm okay.)  (I'm oKAAAYYYYYYY!!!) 

Aaaah! Aaaah, stop! A- 

(Hehe, yeah, heh) 

(At Red Lobster.)

(no, no, non esistono piщ.)

(OH, SHIT!)

(AAAARRRRHHH!)

(Hey! Fuck off!) 

(You guys, just fly away!)

(Oh my God, I think they're screwing.)

(Totally!)

(Those titties are fuckin' huge!) 

(Uff--!) 

(Hey you guys, I talked to Garrison and he told me that they're almost the same.)

(Hey, that's not fair! I got the fucking ticket!)  (Hey! What the heck!)

(Yeah. I guess so.)

(You've ever done?!)

(Yeah, right! Awesome!)

(Oh my God!) 

(No!)

(Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo-hoo! Yeah, hey, yay!) 

(Uh huh.)

(Me?)

(Nope.)

(Hehe, yeah. Hehe)

(Gaaahaha, he got you again!)

(Yes, sir!)

(I don't really know!)

(Waa-choo!)

(Yeah, I know, dude.)

(Huh?)

(Yeah. Everything is fine.)

(Nuh uh.) 

(Ow!)

(I'm singing as good as I can!)

(Stan??)

(Yes.)  (But what about Stan?)

Nonono wait, I'm not Blanket!

Quack-quack.

(Good for me.)

(Being poor has nothing to do with NASCAR!)

(I don't know!)

(No fucking way!)

(Fuck this!) 

(Stop this car!)

(Yeah, I didn't- 

(Kyle's crazy!)

(Dude, it's a pipe for your peepee)

(Are you fuckin' telling me that I could've fuckin' gone that way?!)

(Yeah!)

Purincessu Kenni daijobu dayo! 

(Yep! Woo-hoo!) 

(Fuck! Oops!) 

(You know what I think? Basically, if you let the decision of what you watch stop at the parents' control, then what can you see? It'll stay the same because they'll just get offended although their kids are not delighted with the television series they put on for their kids.)

(Who fuckin' cares?)

(Why?)

(Me too.)

(This is Team B.)

(No, No, Scrotie McBoogerballs)

(Okay, I've reached the generator)

(Kyle, I'm gonna camp and watch the meteor shower. Do you wanna come and see it with me?)

(Let me try! Let me try!)

(Yeah, I think so.)

(Yes, sir..!)

(Woooooh! Woooooh!) 

(Yahoo!) 

(Me too!)

(It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's operation-)

(Fuck you.)

(Aw.)

(Woohoo!)

(He's not gonna do it?!) 

(I don't know. But I've gotta think of something.) 

(Woohoo!)

(No, I'm partners with Craig) 

(I don't care. I've gotta get some protection.)

What the hell is going on, you guys?

(Negative.)

(I agree. Let's put in this DVD and watch Grey's Anatomy.)

(Here.) 

(Yeah, dude!)

(Uhm, I'll take one of those.)

(I'm telling you, it's Kyle you want. He's the one who tried to get me in here, and you know it.)

(Yow!) 

(Sure you can.) 

(Thanks.) 

(Goddamn.)

(Yes)

(Uh huh)

(Yeahhh!)

(I guess the only thing I wish is to not die.)

(No way in hell I'm doing it.)

(Uh huh.)

(I can't take it!)

(You guys, take it seriously.)

(You suck ass and you suck dick!) 

(What??)

(Yeah, that was my idea.)

(Yes. I'm looking for some morning-after abortion-)

(Commentary?)

(Sixty two)

(See, a tampon is what you stick up your ass so you don't bleed.)

(Dude, what the fuck is so filthy or offensive in here?)

(Hey you guys. Remember when Terrance and Phillip was off the air?)

{And a real huge dick.}

(Dude! We've gotta watch!)

(No! NASCAR fans aren't stupid! Cartman is!)

(One please.)

(Aghh!)

(Yeah, that's because you vomit on her all the time.) 

(Almost 7:30)

(Hit the X button, Kyle!)

(Wooooooooo! Woo! Wazzup? Wazzup?) 

(Aw come on, fuck you!) 

(You do?)

(You fucking asshole!)

(No! Daddy!) 

(What? These?)

Quack-quack.

(Hey!)

(Stop taping!)

(Ooh, the penis!)

(Woohoo!)  (I mean, 'Oh.') 

(Oh, I was so close! You should have seen those titties.)

(Unngh. Stop, no! No, it's mine!)  (There! It's mine!) 

(Welcome to my kingdom, Sir Eric. Now, state your purpose.)

(Where am I?)

(Are you serious?!)

(Woohoohoo! Woooohoooo! Woooohoohoo!)

(Oh boy.)

(Oh, hi, guys.)

(Butters!)

(Giant douche.)

(I'd like a box of condoms, please.)

(Woohooo!) 

(Me neither!)

(Yeah! I think...)

(A little.)

(I fuckin' hate Craig!)

(You don't?)

(I did, I gotta go again...)

(Yeah.)

(I fucking hate you!)

(O Oh) 

(Yeah!)

(How about this?)

(I'll do it.)

(Eric, well you're my best friend, too.)

(Yeah, can we go?)

(Woohoo!)

(Ah, fuck you!) 

(They didn't put me at the bottom, did they?)

(Heellp!!)

(What the fuck are you talking about?)

(Waarrggh!!)  (Dude! You guys, I really, really don't have time to tell you that-- Argghh..!) 

(Oh, fuck it, dude.) 

Beavers! 

(Butters, come on.)

(Pakew! Pakew!)

(Oh.)

(Yep. I like the food!)

(Me too.)

(No fuckin' way, dude!)

(Yeah.)

(Cash.)

(Aaaaaa!) 

(Yeah!)

(Well, I like you-)

(A little like a vagina.)

(Hm hm, noho, that's not what it means.)

(Yeah!)

(Hey cool! Check it out!)

(I don't know. I can't find him.)

Hey.  Fuck you, Cartman.

All right, but you guys owe me for this.

(AH how!) 

(Yeah, it's a purity ring.)

(Dammit, here!)

(What?!)

(Hey, God damn it!)

(I did! I was really excited to get a B.J. but now I have to wear this motherfucking purity ring!)

(Me too!) 

(What the hell are we going to do?!)

Stan and Kyle, you take the back entrance. Cartman and I will block him from the side.

(Yeah, maybe we should.)

(It's okay, I'll use my head!) 

(You got pubes??)

(Huh?)

(No, I'm not going to fucking betray anybody!)

(Mom!) 

(Hello.)

(Help help! Heeelllppp!) 

(Europe?)

(Dude, fuck you!)

(I wanna be really good)

(Woohoo!)

My dear friends of the mainland,
What adventures I have found on the tiny island of Kava'i. I have truly become one with the natives, who found new courage to fight their oppressors.

(Woohoo!) 

(Uh huh!)

(To pay for the pockets on his peehole) 

(Okay.)

(Woohoo!)

(You guys, I'm gonna try and win that costume contest!)

Hai, Purincessu Kenni assisuto! 

(Ten million dollars??)

(Jesus Christ, he fucking shot that guy!)

(That is the sickest thing I have ever fucking seen!)

(Yes they do.)

(No, check his penis) 

(Stop!)  (Officer Barbrady, I really need to talk to you!)  (Shit!)

(Yeah!)

(Meee toooo.) 

(You guys, come get this fucking magnet noooowwww!)  (Argh--!)

(Dude, shut the fuck up about my house!)

(Yeah!)

(All set.)

("And I want to see you handling your breasts.")

(Uh huh?)

(Jimmy.)

(Why don'tcha keep your head down?!) 

(Hey you guys, what's goin' on?)

(No.)

(No, nothing!) 

(What are we gonna do??)

(It's a giant stick that goes inside the mom's vagina) 

(No, fuck you! She's my girl!)

(Yeah, see ya.)

(Thank you, Doc.)

(Yeah, I don't get it.)

(Because! His grandmother just died and her will says Cartman now has a million dollars!)

(What's that?) 

(What?)

(Alright!) 

(Shut up, Cartman, you blood-belching vagina!)

(Okay, okay! I'll go.) 

(I understand, dude.)

(Of course, dude!)

(Woohoo!)

(Wing?) 

(What the fuck is going on?)

(In my family, it's a silly enterprise.)

(No we don't, guys.)

(I just want to be on TV.)

(Oh you forgot to get some Judas Priest.)

(Woohoo!)

(Yeah!)

(Very well, thank you.)

Tadaima! 

(And it's time for us to come clean.) 

(con te io li rivivrт.)

(Yeah, No shit.)

(Okay)

(Woohoo!) 

(Jonas Brothers?)

(Aww.)  (Okay, you guys, we've gotta get back to the camp and... )

(Hey! What the hell are you doing?!)

(You bastard!)

(...What?)

(What?)

(Aah-) 

(The titties! Oh my god, they were incredible!)

(The Geniuses...)

(Yeah.)

(I think if we run, try to get Eric to drop his tea)

(Woo hoo!)

(Oh nooo!)

(Uh huh)

(HA! You fucking lose!)

(Give me that-!) 

(Yeah, that'd be awesome!)

(Bye, ladies.) 

(Mine is so fuckin' badass it's gotta win now!)

(Really??)

(What the fuck are we doing?)

(And did you stick it in right when the fireplace gave you the shadow light?)

(Yes. What's up, my lord?)

(Our egg is okay.)

(Uh huh!)

(Yeah! Fuck you!)

Ha? Ueddingu? 

(Uh huh.)

(Uh oh. Hey uh, you guys! Help me doooowwwwnnnn! Heeyy, you guuuuyyyyys!) 

(AAAAAAAAAAAAAA...) 

(Yeah, me neither.)

(What?!)

(This is not herpes, it's a cold sore!)

(What kind of fuckin' miracle?!) 

(That's the truth.)

(Hey!)

(Sonofabitch!) 

(What?)

(Fuck?!)

(Sure!)

(Yeah.)

(Me too!)

(Hey, that's odd.)  (Hey, I'm floating. That can't be! Hey wait!) 

(Whoops!)

(Woohoo!)

(Damn.)

(What?)  (Oh oooooooOOOOOOOH!) 

(Yeah, look at yourself, dude.)

(AAAAHH!) 

(Really?!)

(Hey!)  (Hey, Cartman, help me.)

(Hey, you guys! You guys, I think I know precisely what it's saying. It says that we've gotta go and find a pile of records and get the one that has the entire lyrics, and then we gotta get into learning to rearrange them.)

(Look at this. More DVDs.) 

(Oh, yeah)

(Okay. I can do that.)  (Christ!)
