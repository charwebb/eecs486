So we're uniting and marching on the town square!
Why thank you, young man. We're the Smiths.
We could buy hundreds of acres of land for next to nothing! And then I could finally live like a cowboy.
Well, here it is. Our home to be.
You really should come give it a look. Jada and I would love for some friends to move here with us.
Ooo, look at this, honey.  A beautiful unspoiled town in the Rockies. This is just what we've been looking for!
And so it is with great determination that us decent rich Americans have gathered to say: "We will be separated no more!"
Well I found the place, Snooty-roo. It's in the Rockies, but totally undiscovered, laid-back, and beautiful.
Great, Snoop-Snoop. Listen: Remember how we always talked about wanting to buy property up in the mountains so our kids could ski and ride horses?
Great! Well, let me let you get back to your recording.
How quaint. Kids, why don't you play with little Token while your mother and I check out the town.
Kids! Go find the limo and get in!
