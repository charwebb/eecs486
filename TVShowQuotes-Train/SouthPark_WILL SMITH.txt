So we're uniting and marching on the town square!
Well I found the place, Snooty-roo. It's in the Rockies, but totally undiscovered, laid-back, and beautiful.
Why thank you, young man. We're the Smiths.
Great, Snoop-Snoop. Listen: Remember how we always talked about wanting to buy property up in the mountains so our kids could ski and ride horses?
And so it is with great determination that us decent rich Americans have gathered to say: "We will be separated no more!"
How quaint. Kids, why don't you play with little Token while your mother and I check out the town.
How would you like to move to the Colorado Rockies?
Kids! Go find the limo and get in! 
We could buy hundreds of acres of land for next to nothing! And then I could finally live like a cowboy.
Ooo, look at this, honey.  A beautiful unspoiled town in the Rockies. This is just what we've been looking for!
Great! Well, let me let you get back to your recording.
You really should come give it a look. Jada and I would love for some friends to move here with us.
