Hey Elaine listen. If you smell anything decaying in the trunk of his car...
A man gave me a, you know, massage. (everyone laugh except George)
My father was a lobsterman. He got up every morning at four and came home every night stinking of brine! He sent me through law school with the lobsters he caught! (Kramer stands up from table)
He was you know... he was touching and rubbing. (loud laughter)
So Kramer, where'd you get all these lobster, at the Fleesher's Market?
And you know how extremely sensitive she is?
Is she with your bald friend from the other night?!
Well, he-- he had his hands, you know, and uh, he was, huh, ...
No, they make it in New Jersey. It's just a Danishy name.
There he is, officer. (Michael points to Kramer, Kramer waves to policeman)
I just came from the podiatrist. I have a mole on my foot. I've got a little gangrene, they're probably gonna have to amputate. (everyone laugh except George)
Yeah. What are we looking at here? Is this guy like a real loser?
I can't relax. I don't know what line! I don't know any of 'em!
He's finished! I'm going to sew his ass to his face! I'm going to twist his neck so hard his lips will be his eyebrows! I'm going to break his joints, and reattach them!
Those are commercial lobster traps. You can't take those lobsters from there. That's against the law.
Guess you better keep on his good side.
If she's not with you, then where is she?
Uh, she said she was going to be with you.
Toby, what can I do? Can I get you something?
