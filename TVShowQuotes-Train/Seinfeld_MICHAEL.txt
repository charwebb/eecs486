I can't remember my lines!!!
Toby please let us help. We're family.
The ocean? What'd you mean?
What do you need new sneakers for?
He's finished! I'm going to sew his ass to his face! I'm going to twist his neck so hard his lips will be his eyebrows! I'm going to break his joints, and reattach them!
Hey Elaine listen. If you smell anything decaying in the trunk of his car...
New sneakers?
My father was a lobsterman. He got up every morning at four and came home every night stinking of brine! He sent me through law school with the lobsters he caught! (Kramer stands up from table)
You think you're so damn special because you say 'God bless you'?
Thanks for the lobster, Kramer.
Uh, she said she was going to be with you.
Hey.
I think it moved.
What happened?
Yeah. What are we looking at here? Is this guy like a real loser?
Help me Jerry! Help me!
Guess you better keep on his good side.
Hi, it's Michael.
I just came from the podiatrist. I have a mole on my foot. I've got a little gangrene, they're probably gonna have to amputate. (everyone laugh except George)
So Kramer, where'd you get all these lobster, at the Fleesher's Market?
Well, he-- he had his hands, you know, and uh, he was, huh, ...
Is she with your bald friend from the other night?!
Excuse me?
Well who's side are you taking?!
Rifkin? Joel Rifkin?
Toby, what can I do? Can I get you something?
A man gave me a, you know, massage. (everyone laugh except George)
No, they make it in New Jersey. It's just a Danishy name.
Is Robin there?
And you know how extremely sensitive she is?
She's gonna need our full support.
All right! Take his side!
What do you mean Danish?
There he is, officer. (Michael points to Kramer, Kramer waves to policeman)
I can't relax. I don't know what line! I don't know any of 'em!
He was you know... he was touching and rubbing. (loud laughter)
