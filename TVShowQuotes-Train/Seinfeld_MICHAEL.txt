I just came from the podiatrist. I have a mole on my foot. I've got a little gangrene, they're probably gonna have to amputate. (everyone laugh except George)
All right! Take his side!
Wow.
No, they make it in New Jersey. It's just a Danishy name.
You think you're so damn special because you say 'God bless you'?
Hi, it's Michael.
I can't relax. I don't know what line! I don't know any of 'em!
I can't remember my lines!!!
Those are commercial lobster traps. You can't take those lobsters from there. That's against the law.
She's gonna need our full support.
Excuse me?
What do you need new sneakers for?
Well who's side are you taking?!
There he is, officer. (Michael points to Kramer, Kramer waves to policeman)
Toby, what can I do? Can I get you something?
Help me Jerry! Help me!
Hey.

Well, he-- he had his hands, you know, and uh, he was, huh, ...
Is she with your bald friend from the other night?!
Guess you better keep on his good side.
What happened?
He was you know... he was touching and rubbing. (loud laughter)
Yeah. What are we looking at here? Is this guy like a real loser?
New sneakers?
Thanks for the lobster, Kramer.
Uh, she said she was going to be with you.
Rifkin? Joel Rifkin?
And you know how extremely sensitive she is?
Is Robin there?
What do you mean Danish?
My father was a lobsterman. He got up every morning at four and came home every night stinking of brine! He sent me through law school with the lobsters he caught! (Kramer stands up from table)
A man gave me a, you know, massage. (everyone laugh except George)
So Kramer, where'd you get all these lobster, at the Fleesher's Market?
He's finished! I'm going to sew his ass to his face! I'm going to twist his neck so hard his lips will be his eyebrows! I'm going to break his joints, and reattach them!
The ocean? What'd you mean?
