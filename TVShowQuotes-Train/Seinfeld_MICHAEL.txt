Is Robin there?
I just came from the podiatrist. I have a mole on my foot. I've got a little gangrene, they're probably gonna have to amputate. (everyone laugh except George)
Toby, what can I do? Can I get you something?
He's finished! I'm going to sew his ass to his face! I'm going to twist his neck so hard his lips will be his eyebrows! I'm going to break his joints, and reattach them!
Well who's side are you taking?!
Those are commercial lobster traps. You can't take those lobsters from there. That's against the law.
No, they make it in New Jersey. It's just a Danishy name.
What do you mean Danish?
He was you know... he was touching and rubbing. (loud laughter)
And you know how extremely sensitive she is?
A man gave me a, you know, massage. (everyone laugh except George)
Excuse me?
So Kramer, where'd you get all these lobster, at the Fleesher's Market?
Hey.
I think it moved.
You think you're so damn special because you say 'God bless you'?
Toby please let us help. We're family.
If she's not with you, then where is she?
Is she with your bald friend from the other night?!
Hey Elaine listen. If you smell anything decaying in the trunk of his car...
What do you need new sneakers for?
Uh, she said she was going to be with you.
I can't remember my lines!!!
Wow.
Well, he-- he had his hands, you know, and uh, he was, huh, ...
Thanks for the lobster, Kramer.
New sneakers?
The ocean? What'd you mean?
Help me Jerry! Help me!
Yeah. What are we looking at here? Is this guy like a real loser?
Rifkin? Joel Rifkin?
All right! Take his side!
How do you make a decision which one to wear? I'd go crazy if I have to decide which sneakers to wear every day.
Hi, it's Michael.
She's gonna need our full support.
There he is, officer. (Michael points to Kramer, Kramer waves to policeman)
