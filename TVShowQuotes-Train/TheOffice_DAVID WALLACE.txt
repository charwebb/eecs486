[on phone] Hey! I just heard you guys made the sale.
[after accidentally seeing Michael and Holly kiss] No, I did not know that Michael was dating Holly.
[on phone] Michael, David Wallace.  What is this about dismissing the ad people?
Ok, Dwight, gonna ask you to not call my cell anymore. Gotta go.
Dwight, could you come in here for a second, please?
Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Come on���what I was about to say was Dwight���[phone buzzes] Oh, I���m sorry, I gotta���This���ll be a second, sorry.
Well, finish up. I'm gonna meet with Val about that warehouse guy you had to let go and you and I will talk in 15 minutes?
Well, I'm just glad to know you're happy because you know I felt bad.
Wait, I'm sorry. Michael, are you-- are you texting me?
So, the reason that I called you in here is because Andy is moving on.
So Michael, do you think you can give me a run down on the Buffalo clients by Monday?
I was happy to send Michael on this trip.  He's been feeling pretty down since we had to transfer Holly up to New Hampshire.  But this little perk really seemed to turn him around. [chuckling] And it's pretty tough to find somebody who wants to go up to Winnipeg mid-November.
Here. Scranton. [Dwight falls to his knees] Come on. Come on, Dwight. Get up. Let���s go. It���s good news.
...No, you lied to me Andy. You pretended to be in this office for three months and you were sailing on your boat!
Look, I need you both to take care of this. This is not going to be a problem, is it?
Uh, well, I guess I can���t stand in the way of a man���s dream. And it seems like you have the gift.
So you think you���ve been too focused on your job?
And I know we have a call scheduled for later ���
We put the past behind us, though, Andy.
Jim, another thing. Since we are gonna have to hire this junior sales associate to cover for you, I am going to have to pay you only for the days that you actually work.
Attention, everyone, just a quick announcement. Little reconfiguration to the staff. Dwight Schrute���
Michael, you have to take responsibility here. One of your employees had a heart attack.  He could have died, because of the way that you are allowing your office to run.  Do you want that on your conscious?
This isn���t going to be an easy conversation. I told Andy that he was on very thin ice when he snuck away from three months to the Caribbean. Then last week he used company money to buy a top-of-the-line photo printer. In his words, ���The kind that���s good for head shots.��� And yesterday, he asked me to pay for cheek implants. Claimed it���s gonna boost office morale. Now, he���s a good guy. But honestly, at some point, the ice gets too thin and you fall through. And that is when you get fired.
Sounds great. Don't let me interrupt. What ever you guys have been doing this last quarter, I couldn't be happier with the numbers.
We had to pay for it.  Cost us thirty five hundred dollars.
No, no, no, no, no. This was rough. We never meant for you to get caught in the middle of this. I'm very sorry.
Again! And I���m looking for a new manager. And with his performance this year, I have been considering Dwight. Am I crazy?
And in terms of nightlife, when you get there just ask the concierge.
[on phone] Hey Jim, I thought our call was for later.
He said that? He���s an odd guy, isn���t he?
There���s probably no way I can talk you into staying at this point, can I?
Uh, uh, uh, uh, Andy was not fired.
It���s like seeing a documentary about how your food is made. It���s kinda disgusting. You learn a lot, but I didn���t wanna know any of it.
Could you tell me why you had to cut the face off the dummy?
Would you let Charles know that David is here, please?  Jim, hey.
Well, I gotta tell you, Jim, a lot of guys in my circle? They wouldn���t even change their golf schedule to shore up their marriage let alone their professional goals.
You can stay on as a salesman, Andy.
So you���you want to quit Dunder Mifflin to pursue acting?
Okay. Jim, I���m gonna have to stop you right there.
I'm sorry to hear the hotel was bad.
Hey, Andy. Can we go in your office and talk?
Thank you Michael, thanks, thanks everybody. I'd like to auction off a weekend at my place in Martha's Vineyard. Hey, hey!
Hey guys, um, I'm calling, because, unfortunately, we will not be able to give out cost of living raises this year, and I know people expect it. However, there just is only a small amount of money for each branch, so we're leaving it up to the managers to decide how to distribute it.
All right. Everyone! [waves to office and exits]
Good, very good.  See, told you.  Sounds like somebody had a good trip.
I know, Dwight. I know. [reaches out to shake Dwight���s hand, Dwight hugs him] Okay. Okay. All righty. You���re gonna do great.
[on phone] Hey, Andy. It's David. Still here. What was that about three months?
How could you possibly think this is a good idea?
I think your ideas are fantastic, Oscar. I���d love to contribute to your campaign.
