...No, you lied to me Andy. You pretended to be in this office for three months and you were sailing on your boat!
Well, I gotta tell you, Jim, a lot of guys in my circle? They wouldn���t even change their golf schedule to shore up their marriage let alone their professional goals.
[on phone] Michael, David Wallace.  What is this about dismissing the ad people?
We had to pay for it.  Cost us thirty five hundred dollars.
So, the reason that I called you in here is because Andy is moving on.
I think your ideas are fantastic, Oscar. I���d love to contribute to your campaign.
[on phone] Then we���ll get him a new set of drums.
Well, finish up. I'm gonna meet with Val about that warehouse guy you had to let go and you and I will talk in 15 minutes?
Wait, I'm sorry. Michael, are you-- are you texting me?
Ok, Dwight, gonna ask you to not call my cell anymore. Gotta go.
I was happy to send Michael on this trip.  He's been feeling pretty down since we had to transfer Holly up to New Hampshire.  But this little perk really seemed to turn him around. [chuckling] And it's pretty tough to find somebody who wants to go up to Winnipeg mid-November.
Jim says he���d like some say in the hiring process.
Attention, everyone, just a quick announcement. Little reconfiguration to the staff. Dwight Schrute���
So Michael, do you think you can give me a run down on the Buffalo clients by Monday?
There���s probably no way I can talk you into staying at this point, can I?
Dwight, could you come in here for a second, please?
Hey guys, um, I'm calling, because, unfortunately, we will not be able to give out cost of living raises this year, and I know people expect it. However, there just is only a small amount of money for each branch, so we're leaving it up to the managers to decide how to distribute it.
This isn���t going to be an easy conversation. I told Andy that he was on very thin ice when he snuck away from three months to the Caribbean. Then last week he used company money to buy a top-of-the-line photo printer. In his words, ���The kind that���s good for head shots.��� And yesterday, he asked me to pay for cheek implants. Claimed it���s gonna boost office morale. Now, he���s a good guy. But honestly, at some point, the ice gets too thin and you fall through. And that is when you get fired.
Again! And I���m looking for a new manager. And with his performance this year, I have been considering Dwight. Am I crazy?
[on phone] Hey, Andy. It's David. Still here. What was that about three months?
You could have burned down the whole building.
Uh, uh, uh, uh, Andy was not fired.
We put the past behind us, though, Andy.
[on phone] Hey Jim, I thought our call was for later.
I'm sorry to hear the hotel was bad.
Could you tell me why you had to cut the face off the dummy?
So you���you want to quit Dunder Mifflin to pursue acting?
Would you let Charles know that David is here, please?  Jim, hey.
Look, I need you both to take care of this. This is not going to be a problem, is it?
No, no, no, no, no. This was rough. We never meant for you to get caught in the middle of this. I'm very sorry.
How could you possibly think this is a good idea?
And in terms of nightlife, when you get there just ask the concierge.
All right. Everyone! [waves to office and exits]
So you think you���ve been too focused on your job?
Hey, Andy. Can we go in your office and talk?
I know, Dwight. I know. [reaches out to shake Dwight���s hand, Dwight hugs him] Okay. Okay. All righty. You���re gonna do great.
Sensei, do you generally do house calls like this?
Thank you Michael, thanks, thanks everybody. I'd like to auction off a weekend at my place in Martha's Vineyard. Hey, hey!
You can stay on as a salesman, Andy.
And I know we have a call scheduled for later ���
Good, very good.  See, told you.  Sounds like somebody had a good trip.
Okay. Jim, I���m gonna have to stop you right there.
[after accidentally seeing Michael and Holly kiss] No, I did not know that Michael was dating Holly.
Sounds great. Don't let me interrupt. What ever you guys have been doing this last quarter, I couldn't be happier with the numbers.
Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Come on���what I was about to say was Dwight���[phone buzzes] Oh, I���m sorry, I gotta���This���ll be a second, sorry.
[on phone] Hey! I just heard you guys made the sale.
Here. Scranton. [Dwight falls to his knees] Come on. Come on, Dwight. Get up. Let���s go. It���s good news.
Jim, another thing. Since we are gonna have to hire this junior sales associate to cover for you, I am going to have to pay you only for the days that you actually work.
Uh, well, I guess I can���t stand in the way of a man���s dream. And it seems like you have the gift.
