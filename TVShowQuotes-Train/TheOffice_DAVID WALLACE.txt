So you think you���ve been too focused on your job?
We had to pay for it.  Cost us thirty five hundred dollars.
Here. Scranton. [Dwight falls to his knees] Come on. Come on, Dwight. Get up. Let���s go. It���s good news.
Could you tell me why you had to cut the face off the dummy?
...No, you lied to me Andy. You pretended to be in this office for three months and you were sailing on your boat!
We put the past behind us, though, Andy.
Well, I gotta tell you, Jim, a lot of guys in my circle? They wouldn���t even change their golf schedule to shore up their marriage let alone their professional goals.
So you���you want to quit Dunder Mifflin to pursue acting?
I'm sorry to hear the hotel was bad.
Attention, everyone, just a quick announcement. Little reconfiguration to the staff. Dwight Schrute���
It���s like seeing a documentary about how your food is made. It���s kinda disgusting. You learn a lot, but I didn���t wanna know any of it.
So Michael, do you think you can give me a run down on the Buffalo clients by Monday?
Again! And I���m looking for a new manager. And with his performance this year, I have been considering Dwight. Am I crazy?
Look, I need you both to take care of this. This is not going to be a problem, is it?
Uh, uh, uh, uh, Andy was not fired.
All right. Everyone! [waves to office and exits]
You can stay on as a salesman, Andy.
Jim, another thing. Since we are gonna have to hire this junior sales associate to cover for you, I am going to have to pay you only for the days that you actually work.
Dwight, could you come in here for a second, please?
Uh, well, I guess I can���t stand in the way of a man���s dream. And it seems like you have the gift.
So, the reason that I called you in here is because Andy is moving on.
Hey guys, um, I'm calling, because, unfortunately, we will not be able to give out cost of living raises this year, and I know people expect it. However, there just is only a small amount of money for each branch, so we're leaving it up to the managers to decide how to distribute it.
[on phone] Then we���ll get him a new set of drums.
Okay. Jim, I���m gonna have to stop you right there.
[on phone] Hey Jim, I thought our call was for later.
There���s probably no way I can talk you into staying at this point, can I?
Well, I'm just glad to know you're happy because you know I felt bad.
Wait, I'm sorry. Michael, are you-- are you texting me?
[on phone] Hey, Andy. It's David. Still here. What was that about three months?
Ok, Dwight, gonna ask you to not call my cell anymore. Gotta go.
And in terms of nightlife, when you get there just ask the concierge.
[after accidentally seeing Michael and Holly kiss] No, I did not know that Michael was dating Holly.
I was happy to send Michael on this trip.  He's been feeling pretty down since we had to transfer Holly up to New Hampshire.  But this little perk really seemed to turn him around. [chuckling] And it's pretty tough to find somebody who wants to go up to Winnipeg mid-November.
Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Come on���what I was about to say was Dwight���[phone buzzes] Oh, I���m sorry, I gotta���This���ll be a second, sorry.
I think your ideas are fantastic, Oscar. I���d love to contribute to your campaign.
This isn���t going to be an easy conversation. I told Andy that he was on very thin ice when he snuck away from three months to the Caribbean. Then last week he used company money to buy a top-of-the-line photo printer. In his words, ���The kind that���s good for head shots.��� And yesterday, he asked me to pay for cheek implants. Claimed it���s gonna boost office morale. Now, he���s a good guy. But honestly, at some point, the ice gets too thin and you fall through. And that is when you get fired.
Would you let Charles know that David is here, please?  Jim, hey.
I know, Dwight. I know. [reaches out to shake Dwight���s hand, Dwight hugs him] Okay. Okay. All righty. You���re gonna do great.
You could have burned down the whole building.
[on phone] Michael, David Wallace.  What is this about dismissing the ad people?
He said that? He���s an odd guy, isn���t he?
Michael, you have to take responsibility here. One of your employees had a heart attack.  He could have died, because of the way that you are allowing your office to run.  Do you want that on your conscious?
Jim says he���d like some say in the hiring process.
Well, finish up. I'm gonna meet with Val about that warehouse guy you had to let go and you and I will talk in 15 minutes?
Thank you Michael, thanks, thanks everybody. I'd like to auction off a weekend at my place in Martha's Vineyard. Hey, hey!
Hey, Andy. Can we go in your office and talk?
Sensei, do you generally do house calls like this?
[on phone] Hey! I just heard you guys made the sale.
Good, very good.  See, told you.  Sounds like somebody had a good trip.
