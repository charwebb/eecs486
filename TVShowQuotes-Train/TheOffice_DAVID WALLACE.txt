It looked fine to me.
OK.
Thank you Michael, thanks, thanks everybody. I'd like to auction off a weekend at my place in Martha's Vineyard. Hey, hey!
And in terms of nightlife, when you get there just ask the concierge.
There���s probably no way I can talk you into staying at this point, can I?
Here. Scranton. [Dwight falls to his knees] Come on. Come on, Dwight. Get up. Let���s go. It���s good news.
Yeah.
200
The hotel? What, M--- okay.
You can stay on as a salesman, Andy.
Would you let Charles know that David is here, please?  Jim, hey.
Well, good luck.
It���s like seeing a documentary about how your food is made. It���s kinda disgusting. You learn a lot, but I didn���t wanna know any of it.
Excuse me?
Michael, the... that's for your food.
No, no, no, no, no. This was rough. We never meant for you to get caught in the middle of this. I'm very sorry.
No, we are mad.
We put the past behind us, though, Andy.
Oh my god.
Yeah.
Well, I'm just glad to know you're happy because you know I felt bad.
[leaving] Great job, everybody!
I'm sorry to hear the hotel was bad.
Dwight?
Well, thanks Dwight.
Andy���
Well, finish up. I'm gonna meet with Val about that warehouse guy you had to let go and you and I will talk in 15 minutes?
This isn���t going to be an easy conversation. I told Andy that he was on very thin ice when he snuck away from three months to the Caribbean. Then last week he used company money to buy a top-of-the-line photo printer. In his words, ���The kind that���s good for head shots.��� And yesterday, he asked me to pay for cheek implants. Claimed it���s gonna boost office morale. Now, he���s a good guy. But honestly, at some point, the ice gets too thin and you fall through. And that is when you get fired.
Jim, what the hell is happening there?
Where?
Uh, well, I guess I can���t stand in the way of a man���s dream. And it seems like you have the gift.
Yeah. What���s up Jim?
What fire?
All right. Everyone! [waves to office and exits]
Jim, another thing. Since we are gonna have to hire this junior sales associate to cover for you, I am going to have to pay you only for the days that you actually work.
Yeah.
Again! And I���m looking for a new manager. And with his performance this year, I have been considering Dwight. Am I crazy?
We had to pay for it.  Cost us thirty five hundred dollars.
So Michael, do you think you can give me a run down on the Buffalo clients by Monday?
I may have heard from an old client, and I may have immediately started spreading the news to other clients and potential clients, yeah. But I'm not here to talk about that. I am here to talk about Suck It. Suck it.
Michael, you have to take responsibility here. One of your employees had a heart attack.  He could have died, because of the way that you are allowing your office to run.  Do you want that on your conscious?
Hey, Dwight. It���s David.
Uh-huh, but���
Okay. Jim, I���m gonna have to stop you right there.
Attention, everyone, just a quick announcement. Little reconfiguration to the staff. Dwight Schrute���
Okay, I'll see it tomorrow.
No, we're not.
[on phone] Then we���ll get him a new set of drums.
Okay.
Well that kind of worked out.
[enters] Hey guys.
Yeah? Are you ok?
Enough, Andy. Enough!
It's probably a little of both.
Sometimes, we-- [Michael hangs up phone]
350
I know, Dwight. I know. [reaches out to shake Dwight���s hand, Dwight hugs him] Okay. Okay. All righty. You���re gonna do great.
[On phone] Hello?
This is weird.
So you think you���ve been too focused on your job?
[on phone] Hey Jim, I thought our call was for later.
I don���t think so.
...No, you lied to me Andy. You pretended to be in this office for three months and you were sailing on your boat!
Very good.
[after accidentally seeing Michael and Holly kiss] No, I did not know that Michael was dating Holly.
Sensei, do you generally do house calls like this?
Uh, uh, uh, uh, Andy was not fired.
I know.
Excuse me?
Okay.
Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Come on���what I was about to say was Dwight���[phone buzzes] Oh, I���m sorry, I gotta���This���ll be a second, sorry.
[on speakerphone] Do you have your passport?
Why do you already have this?
Got your per diem?
Dwight, could you come in here for a second, please?
What?
[on phone] Hey! I just heard you guys made the sale.
Hey guys, um, I'm calling, because, unfortunately, we will not be able to give out cost of living raises this year, and I know people expect it. However, there just is only a small amount of money for each branch, so we're leaving it up to the managers to decide how to distribute it.
What?
It���s okay. Go ahead, Jim.
I think your ideas are fantastic, Oscar. I���d love to contribute to your campaign.
Jim says he���d like some say in the hiring process.
You sure?
He said that? He���s an odd guy, isn���t he?
Wait, I'm sorry. Michael, are you-- are you texting me?
Look, I need you both to take care of this. This is not going to be a problem, is it?
So, the reason that I called you in here is because Andy is moving on.
What are you talking about?
Ok, Dwight, gonna ask you to not call my cell anymore. Gotta go.
Hey.
Hey, Erin. Is Andy in?
Could you tell me why you had to cut the face off the dummy?
[preparing to leave] Thanks, Andy.
I was happy to send Michael on this trip.  He's been feeling pretty down since we had to transfer Holly up to New Hampshire.  But this little perk really seemed to turn him around. [chuckling] And it's pretty tough to find somebody who wants to go up to Winnipeg mid-November.
Michael?
So you���you want to quit Dunder Mifflin to pursue acting?
How could you possibly think this is a good idea?
