...No, you lied to me Andy. You pretended to be in this office for three months and you were sailing on your boat!
Well, I gotta tell you, Jim, a lot of guys in my circle? They wouldn���t even change their golf schedule to shore up their marriage let alone their professional goals.
So you���you want to quit Dunder Mifflin to pursue acting?
And I know we have a call scheduled for later ���
I know.
What?
Hey.
Okay.
Ok, Dwight, gonna ask you to not call my cell anymore. Gotta go.
Very good.
[leaving] Great job, everybody!
What?
[preparing to leave] Thanks, Andy.
It looked fine to me.
[on speakerphone] Do you have your passport?
You sure?
Jim says he���d like some say in the hiring process.
I know, Dwight. I know. [reaches out to shake Dwight���s hand, Dwight hugs him] Okay. Okay. All righty. You���re gonna do great.
Got your per diem?
What are you talking about?
Enough, Andy. Enough!
Hey, Erin. Is Andy in?
Okay.
How could you possibly think this is a good idea?
Hey, Dwight. It���s David.
[after accidentally seeing Michael and Holly kiss] No, I did not know that Michael was dating Holly.

This isn���t going to be an easy conversation. I told Andy that he was on very thin ice when he snuck away from three months to the Caribbean. Then last week he used company money to buy a top-of-the-line photo printer. In his words, ���The kind that���s good for head shots.��� And yesterday, he asked me to pay for cheek implants. Claimed it���s gonna boost office morale. Now, he���s a good guy. But honestly, at some point, the ice gets too thin and you fall through. And that is when you get fired.
Hey, Andy. Can we go in your office and talk?
[On phone] Hello?
Excuse me?
Dwight?
No, we are mad.
Uh, uh, uh, uh, Andy was not fired.
I was happy to send Michael on this trip.  He's been feeling pretty down since we had to transfer Holly up to New Hampshire.  But this little perk really seemed to turn him around. [chuckling] And it's pretty tough to find somebody who wants to go up to Winnipeg mid-November.
It���s like seeing a documentary about how your food is made. It���s kinda disgusting. You learn a lot, but I didn���t wanna know any of it.
What fire?
Andy���
So, the reason that I called you in here is because Andy is moving on.
Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Come on���what I was about to say was Dwight���[phone buzzes] Oh, I���m sorry, I gotta���This���ll be a second, sorry.
[on phone] Hey, Andy. It's David. Still here. What was that about three months?
I think your ideas are fantastic, Oscar. I���d love to contribute to your campaign.
All right. Everyone! [waves to office and exits]
Uh, well, I guess I can���t stand in the way of a man���s dream. And it seems like you have the gift.
He said that? He���s an odd guy, isn���t he?
Well, finish up. I'm gonna meet with Val about that warehouse guy you had to let go and you and I will talk in 15 minutes?
Thank you Michael, thanks, thanks everybody. I'd like to auction off a weekend at my place in Martha's Vineyard. Hey, hey!
Where?
Well, I'm just glad to know you're happy because you know I felt bad.
No, we're not.
Okay. Jim, I���m gonna have to stop you right there.
Hey guys, um, I'm calling, because, unfortunately, we will not be able to give out cost of living raises this year, and I know people expect it. However, there just is only a small amount of money for each branch, so we're leaving it up to the managers to decide how to distribute it.
Okay, I'll see it tomorrow.
Wait, I'm sorry. Michael, are you-- are you texting me?
[on phone] Then we���ll get him a new set of drums.
Well that kind of worked out.
Attention, everyone, just a quick announcement. Little reconfiguration to the staff. Dwight Schrute���
There���s probably no way I can talk you into staying at this point, can I?
Yeah.
Yeah.
[on phone] Hey! I just heard you guys made the sale.
We had to pay for it.  Cost us thirty five hundred dollars.
This is weird.
Michael?
Uh-huh, but���
Michael, you have to take responsibility here. One of your employees had a heart attack.  He could have died, because of the way that you are allowing your office to run.  Do you want that on your conscious?
Will you be the new manager?
So Michael, do you think you can give me a run down on the Buffalo clients by Monday?
OK.
Dwight?
So you think you���ve been too focused on your job?
Sensei, do you generally do house calls like this?
Could you tell me why you had to cut the face off the dummy?
I may have heard from an old client, and I may have immediately started spreading the news to other clients and potential clients, yeah. But I'm not here to talk about that. I am here to talk about Suck It. Suck it.
Sometimes, we-- [Michael hangs up phone]
And in terms of nightlife, when you get there just ask the concierge.
Look, I need you both to take care of this. This is not going to be a problem, is it?
The hotel? What, M--- okay.
Dwight, could you come in here for a second, please?
It's probably a little of both.
Well, thanks Dwight.
I'm sorry to hear the hotel was bad.
Oh my god.
350
No, no, no, no, no. This was rough. We never meant for you to get caught in the middle of this. I'm very sorry.
Jim, another thing. Since we are gonna have to hire this junior sales associate to cover for you, I am going to have to pay you only for the days that you actually work.
Would you let Charles know that David is here, please?  Jim, hey.
[enters] Hey guys.
We put the past behind us, though, Andy.
Jim, what the hell is happening there?
It���s okay. Go ahead, Jim.
Well, good luck.
You can stay on as a salesman, Andy.
Here. Scranton. [Dwight falls to his knees] Come on. Come on, Dwight. Get up. Let���s go. It���s good news.
Why do you already have this?
Yeah.
Yeah. What���s up Jim?
