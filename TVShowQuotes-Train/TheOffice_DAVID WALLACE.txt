Ok, Dwight, gonna ask you to not call my cell anymore. Gotta go.
Jim says he���d like some say in the hiring process.
So you think you���ve been too focused on your job?
Wait, I'm sorry. Michael, are you-- are you texting me?
It���s like seeing a documentary about how your food is made. It���s kinda disgusting. You learn a lot, but I didn���t wanna know any of it.
How could you possibly think this is a good idea?
We put the past behind us, though, Andy.
[on phone] Then we���ll get him a new set of drums.
Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Come on���what I was about to say was Dwight���[phone buzzes] Oh, I���m sorry, I gotta���This���ll be a second, sorry.
[on phone] Hey Jim, I thought our call was for later.
Well, finish up. I'm gonna meet with Val about that warehouse guy you had to let go and you and I will talk in 15 minutes?
Would you let Charles know that David is here, please?  Jim, hey.
No, no, no, no, no. This was rough. We never meant for you to get caught in the middle of this. I'm very sorry.
I know, Dwight. I know. [reaches out to shake Dwight���s hand, Dwight hugs him] Okay. Okay. All righty. You���re gonna do great.
Thank you Michael, thanks, thanks everybody. I'd like to auction off a weekend at my place in Martha's Vineyard. Hey, hey!
Jim, another thing. Since we are gonna have to hire this junior sales associate to cover for you, I am going to have to pay you only for the days that you actually work.
I may have heard from an old client, and I may have immediately started spreading the news to other clients and potential clients, yeah. But I'm not here to talk about that. I am here to talk about Suck It. Suck it.
[after accidentally seeing Michael and Holly kiss] No, I did not know that Michael was dating Holly.
Well, I gotta tell you, Jim, a lot of guys in my circle? They wouldn���t even change their golf schedule to shore up their marriage let alone their professional goals.
Okay. Jim, I���m gonna have to stop you right there.
You can stay on as a salesman, Andy.
There���s probably no way I can talk you into staying at this point, can I?
Again! And I���m looking for a new manager. And with his performance this year, I have been considering Dwight. Am I crazy?
I'm sorry to hear the hotel was bad.
Could you tell me why you had to cut the face off the dummy?
Look, I need you both to take care of this. This is not going to be a problem, is it?
This isn���t going to be an easy conversation. I told Andy that he was on very thin ice when he snuck away from three months to the Caribbean. Then last week he used company money to buy a top-of-the-line photo printer. In his words, ���The kind that���s good for head shots.��� And yesterday, he asked me to pay for cheek implants. Claimed it���s gonna boost office morale. Now, he���s a good guy. But honestly, at some point, the ice gets too thin and you fall through. And that is when you get fired.
I was happy to send Michael on this trip.  He's been feeling pretty down since we had to transfer Holly up to New Hampshire.  But this little perk really seemed to turn him around. [chuckling] And it's pretty tough to find somebody who wants to go up to Winnipeg mid-November.
He said that? He���s an odd guy, isn���t he?
So Michael, do you think you can give me a run down on the Buffalo clients by Monday?
Sounds great. Don't let me interrupt. What ever you guys have been doing this last quarter, I couldn't be happier with the numbers.
So, the reason that I called you in here is because Andy is moving on.
Here. Scranton. [Dwight falls to his knees] Come on. Come on, Dwight. Get up. Let���s go. It���s good news.
Good, very good.  See, told you.  Sounds like somebody had a good trip.
[on phone] Hey! I just heard you guys made the sale.
Sensei, do you generally do house calls like this?
[on phone] Hey, Andy. It's David. Still here. What was that about three months?
I think your ideas are fantastic, Oscar. I���d love to contribute to your campaign.
Attention, everyone, just a quick announcement. Little reconfiguration to the staff. Dwight Schrute���
All right. Everyone! [waves to office and exits]
[on phone] Michael, David Wallace.  What is this about dismissing the ad people?
Hey guys, um, I'm calling, because, unfortunately, we will not be able to give out cost of living raises this year, and I know people expect it. However, there just is only a small amount of money for each branch, so we're leaving it up to the managers to decide how to distribute it.
And in terms of nightlife, when you get there just ask the concierge.
We had to pay for it.  Cost us thirty five hundred dollars.
Well, I'm just glad to know you're happy because you know I felt bad.
Uh, well, I guess I can���t stand in the way of a man���s dream. And it seems like you have the gift.
And I know we have a call scheduled for later ���
Uh, uh, uh, uh, Andy was not fired.
Michael, you have to take responsibility here. One of your employees had a heart attack.  He could have died, because of the way that you are allowing your office to run.  Do you want that on your conscious?
