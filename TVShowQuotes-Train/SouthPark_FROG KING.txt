Lemmiwinks! I come with news of great gravity. Another rodent is out there, spreading terrible rumors and hacking e-mails.  Yes. And I'm afraid the news is worse. The creature doing this, Lemmiwinks, is your brother, Wikileaks!
But your adventures are just beginning, for you are no ordinary gerbil, Lemmiwinks. You are the Gerbil King. 
Make your way to the small intestine. There you will meet the Sparrow Prince, who can guide you to Catatafish. Now go, Paris Hilton. Make haste! 
Lemmiwinks, you must find a way out of this place, or you will surely die.  This way has been closed off by the Great Sphincter. To escape you must journey upward to the dark reaches of the intestine and past the stomach.  Who am I? Just a friend. Heed my words, Lemmiwinks. Your time is running out. Make for the large intestine. All will be made clear then. 
Paris, you must find the way out of this place or you'll surely die.
Alright Lemmiwinks, we should probably get going now... The time is nigh, Lemmiwinks. Let us chase your destiny.  Ah! Sparrow Prince! What news do you bring?
Quickly, while Lemmiwinks still has it in him!
Faster driver! The final battle is about to begin! 
Hang on, Lemmiwinks! You solved the Catatafish's riddle. Now your trials are nearly through!
I thank God I don't have to make that decision.  We might need to bring in some outside help.
Wikileaks, you have chosen a path of evil and now you shall pay. Sparrow Prince, Catatafish! 
Then the moment is truly here! Come Lemmiwinks! Let us make haste! Le-le-Lemmiwinks? His heart is so heavy. I weep for him.
There's no time, children! You must take Lemmiwinks now!
Lemmiwinks, you are coming to the entrance of the small intestine. Now you must seek out the Sparrow Prince. 
Once again Wikileaks is trying to wreak havoc on our world. Only you can stop him, Lemmiweaks.
