Ah, sure. Poor doorman has to work two jobs to put food on the table for mother and baby. (supercilious) No, I live here. That's okay, isn't it?
Yeah, I just wanna run and get a beer. I'll be back in a minute.
I had to use the bathroom, so I asked this guy to watch the door for a few minutes.
No. I was just messing with his head.
I traded shifts with the night doorman. He had some personal affairs to attend to. You see, my fellow doorman and I watch out for each other. We don't stab each other in the back, like people in your world.
What're you, the boyfriend? Here for a... quickie?
(calling after Jerry) You really think you're better than me, don't you?!
(unfriendly smile) Benes? (moves toward Jerry) No-one here by that name.
Then watch the door for a minute, would you?
Oh, I get it. Why waste time making small talk with the doorman? I should just shut up and do my job, opening the door for you.
(into phone) There's a George Bonanza to see you.
(into phone) Seinfeld friend. (he listens) (to George) He says, call him Monday.
It's not brain surgery. You open the door for people who live here. And, if they don't live here, don't let them in. (takes off his hat) Here. (putting it on Jerry's head) Wear that.
Whoah, whoah, whoah. (rises and turns to Jerry) May I help you?
Well... what do we have here? Perhaps Miss Benes could explain why a Jerry Seinfeld signed for this package (handing the package to Mrs. Payton) at the exact same time the couch was stolen.
