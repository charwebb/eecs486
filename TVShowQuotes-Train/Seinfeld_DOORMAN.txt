Yeah, I just wanna run and get a beer. I'll be back in a minute.
(into phone) There's a George Bonanza to see you.
It's not brain surgery. You open the door for people who live here. And, if they don't live here, don't let them in. (takes off his hat) Here. (putting it on Jerry's head) Wear that.
...What makes you think I wasn't reading the Wall Street page? Oh, I know, because I'm the uneducated doorman.
Well... what do we have here? Perhaps Miss Benes could explain why a Jerry Seinfeld signed for this package (handing the package to Mrs. Payton) at the exact same time the couch was stolen.
Whoah, whoah, whoah. (rises and turns to Jerry) May I help you?
No. I was just messing with his head.
I had to use the bathroom, so I asked this guy to watch the door for a few minutes.
Ah, sure. Poor doorman has to work two jobs to put food on the table for mother and baby. (supercilious) No, I live here. That's okay, isn't it?
(unfriendly smile) Benes? (moves toward Jerry) No-one here by that name.
Oh, I get it. Why waste time making small talk with the doorman? I should just shut up and do my job, opening the door for you.
(into phone) Seinfeld friend. (he listens) (to George) He says, call him Monday.
Then watch the door for a minute, would you?
What're you, the boyfriend? Here for a... quickie?
I traded shifts with the night doorman. He had some personal affairs to attend to. You see, my fellow doorman and I watch out for each other. We don't stab each other in the back, like people in your world.
