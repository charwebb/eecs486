That's my recipe for wild mushroom.
No! Next question.
But the idiot clowns did not know how to order. I banned that one - the woman - for a year. Then one day, she came back.

Very good. Very good.

Ohh! This city.

No soup for you!

That is my recipe for wild mushroom.
Go on! Leave! Get out!

Yes.
Por favor?
They used to come to my restaurant.

You know something?
No soup for you! [snaps fingers]
You want bread?
You want bread?
$3!
Adios muchacho!
