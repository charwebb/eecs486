Read the receipt. That���s a $300 gun. Someone could steal it.
I���m sorry, Dwight, but for once in my stupid, stupid life, I���m gonna follow through on something, all right? I have masculinity issues-- Stop! No!
Checkmate. You win this one, my friend. Do you validate parking?
Let���s get it on. I���m gonna do this. I might-- I might puke, but I���m gonna do this.
Ooh, okay. Didn���t see that one coming. Can I take a 20 on that? Maybe we can circle back around to it.
Hey man, we get how difficult this is. And no matter how you choose, we���re still gonna be your friend.
[yelling] And what are we supposed to do until then?
That���s very effective. I���ve been on the receiving end of that quite a few times. It���s devastating.
I started following people around to get exercise. Turns out, I���m damn good at it.
If you chase me, I will run so fast. If you catch me I will bite so hard. Got it? Good-bye, my friend.
Can you imagine how insulting that would be? The contempt that a person like that would have to have for you.
All right, then it���s settled. One knee-capping. Now, the hit goes down at 4:00. Keep in mind, once I leave, there���s no turning back.
