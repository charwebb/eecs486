Aah! (Jack leaves) The nerve of that guy! Taking back that pen. Well that's it for them.
You don't say? You know I have boxes of those sitting in my garage in Florida?
(searching in a kitchen drawer) What happened to the scotch tape? Who takes the scotch tape? Nobody returns anything around here.
Helen, we got into restaurants and figure out the tips.
I got a guarantee on that watch. Give it to me, I'll take it back to where we got it.
You gotta jiggle it a little bit. I jiggled it. I jiggled it for fifteen minutes.
Look at this! Look at this! (excited) You bought a Cadillac?!
My son bought me the car. It's a present.
Its nothing. I got it. So, how are your levels coming along?
You dont understand, Ive never paid a full fare.
Well you don't have to retract it because we never went.
Well what's the difference we'll go some place else.
Well, if he fixes my back I'll be happy. . . . (back to the form) Have you ever had a sexually transmitted disease? That's IT! . . . Here, you got my name, you got my address. That's enough.
(Jerry comes out of his room, having just woken up) Rise and shine, sleepy head! Ha ha!
Morty Seinfeld. I cut velvet for forty years with Harry Altman.
You know I've been thinking, why is Kramer getting twenty-five percent?
Aw, Jerry. I should be buyin' you presents.
That's right. My son bought it for me.
How the hell am I gonna pay for this?
You what I'll do next time? I'll hide it so nobody can find it.
Izzy used to work out with Charles Atlas in the fifties.
My idiot son could open that garage door.
Look at this. It's a book. Employer's address. Whydo they need this? You know I never had a back problem until that night I slept on the convertible sofa. (hu hu) My back was fine.
You don't understand. I can't allow my son to pay for me. Look, as soon as I get back to Florida, I promise you I'll mail you a check.
What are you talking about? What was I supposed to hide it somewhere?
Make sure Kramer uses good tape when he sends back the raincoats.
Maybe some people don't like him. I could see that.
You won't regret this, Miss Benes. What time should I be in? I get up at four, I could be here as early as four twenty-five.
Oh, you don't see. You don't see. Well it happened. Believe me.
I dont know her either. (gesturing to Helen) She makes me fly all the way from Florida for this, and then she criticizes my jacket.
Hoh, here he is. This is the man I wanted you to see. Izzy Mandelbaum. He's eighty years old, but strong as an ox. (pointing) Watch this.
Say those are some nice pants. I got a pair just like them at home.
What are you talking about? I'm the one who should have called the police. They stole my wallet.
This is a huge scandal! We need damage control.
By the time we sit down, it'll be quarter to five.
(noticing Kramer's coat) Look at that, Helen do you see what he's wearing? That's the Executive.
Well, it's getting kinda late, why don't we uh...
We saw Regis Philbin get out of a limousine.
(from outside the door; singing) I could have danced all night (entering with Helen) I could have danced all night and still have
(loud) Tell them when you took my son's pen back. Tell them about that! (he gets up)
How was I supposed to pay? I didn't have my wallet.
Jerry, what time do we have to be at the the Tonight Show on Thursday.
Jerry, this is Del Boca Vista's new physical fitness room. They got medicine balls, you can bike ride, anything you want.
No no, the luggage is on the program. I got a brick in here.
You don't understand, you gotta have a buffer zone.
Anyway there are these three big boxes, you can't miss them. I want you to ship them here to New York for me.
I'll call Jack Klompus, he's got a key to the garage. He can send them overnight delivery.
So, you stand in the lobby, by the elevator, and wait for her to come down for lunch.
You know Jack, you've got a hell of a nerve taking that kid's pen.
Stay on 95 South to Biscayne Boulevard. Then you make a left turn. Put you blinker on immediatly, there's an abutment there. Then you're gonna merge over very quickly, but stay on Biscayne. Don't get off Biscayne. You understand me?
Hi, Morty Seinfeld. I have a two o'clock appointment.
Where do you come off with this crap?
(to Helen) Slept on the job? (she shushed him)
Hey Jerry, look at this. My seat's got a memory, in case somebody moves it. I could be in prison for five years. I come out, my seat goes right back to where I like it.
I told her you'd get married. She thought you'd never do it.
because she puts up such a big stink every time I have a piece of meat.
You don't understand fashion is cyclical this thing could come back.
That's the second time you said "personal favor". Why do you keep saying that?
Twice! And Dembrow doesn't even know you. His son happens to live on your floor.
(holding Jerry's shoulders) Jerry lives in New York. You just came from New York, didn't you?
Besides, it's not stealing if it's something you need.
The whole movie was in black and white.
I'm sorry, we can't go back to Florida.
(unconcerned) Ach, I never knew what the hell I was peddling with those stupid cartoons and that paper book, anyway.
Hey! This is the kind of room Sinatra stays in. Hey! look , Macadamian nuts.
I'm still going to Paris. I got a big deal cooking here.
I keep telling her it's like an oven in here.
You don't understand, I've come this far, I can't stop now.
Yknow Jerry, its a good thing I wasnt so particular.
Because we had a buyer, and we couldn't get a free flight until now.
Tell your parents we said 'Hi!' (They leave)
All right, all right, Let's go already. They keep you in here a year. They don't give a damn. I could die in here. . . .(open the door and shouts into the hallway) Excuse me! Excuse me! What's going on? I'm here twenty minutes. Could somebody please help me.
Don't worry. I'll get to the other functions. (trying to open it) I can't get it open.
(eating lunch with Helen and Jerry) Another fine meal, and now for my Wizard tip calculator.
This is some building, Harry Fleming used to have an office here. There was a deli on the first floor. You don't get corned beef like that anymore. What happened to that deli?
They're good around the house -- and they're good for outside.
You should be! How could you spend two hundred dollars on a tip calculator?!
He thought he could buy back that Cadillac for us? He's not getting away with that.
Your mother doesn't like my taste in clothing.
Oh my God! What the hell happened to you?
Oh my God! She's gotta make a big deal out of everything.
(trying to press the cheque on Jerry) And we want you to have the money.
I'm sorry Leo's moving back here. I'm not ready to go back to Florida.
You see, he had the right idea. Hold out. That's how you get the big money, huh George? (slaps George on the shoulder)
You know what the flight backll cost us?
All this? This whole thing? It's going to take me forty-five minutes.
Just a second. (Goes to grab the phone)
I'll tell you what I'm looking at the next condo president of Del Boca Vista, Phase Three.
(to Helen) You don't want it? Are you kidding?
No, we just came for the funeral. `
I don't have it. I'll mail you one.
Look, if we're gonna stay here until all hours of the night, can we at least get some food here?
Hey! I do you like this? Huh, huh!
(rushing to his bedroom) First, I need a nap.
Hey, I agree with him. Nobody likes a kid with a pony.
Take it easy, I've been through a million of these negotiations.
Would you excuse me please, we're conducting business here.
Well, I sold raincoats in the garment centre for thirty-eight years. In nineteen forty-nine...
Aw! Aw! Oh my back! Oh my back! It's that bar. Who the hell could sleep on that thing?
HaAhhh! The Velcro. I can't stand Velcro. It's that t-e-a-r-I-n-g sound. I used to be in raincoats. I refused to put that in any of my lines.
(getting up from the table and coming over) Why is that?
Hey! Look at this, a wallet. Exactly what I needed, y'see.
(standing) Okay, I'm done. I'll be back in the morning, when he's close to finish with his story.
What? Im gonna buy a new sport jacket now?
What are you talking? Jeffrey works for the parks department!
Only twenty-five minutes a day, and you can attach it to any doorknob.
How the hell do you work this thing?
I want to know what kind of an office this is where you can't leave your pants in the room. You tell me.
Well, maybe you better make a pot of tea, too.
So what, why is that worth twenty-five percent? It's a finders fee. You know what a finders fee is?
I'm very comfortable working outta the house. I have a phone, we have a Kinko's nearby. You know, I think that my resume speaks for itself.
D'you realise, an above-average performing growth mutual fund for fifty-three years...
Then who the hell said you couldn't have any? I mean what the hell do I care whether you have sponge cake?
That had nothing to do with it, the man was out of shape.
No, no, he won't let me do that.
Sorbonne? Oh, hey. (To Helen) That's in Paris.
So, I can use it in the restaurant to figure out the tip?
Because if you are, you shouldn't. There's nothing available in that development.
Well, we just bought a new place down there.
I wanna tell you. This is one of the most thoughtful gifts anyone's ever given me.
Hey! Leo, get this, four movies at once; Pay Per View.
Listen, is it all right if we move in with you for a little while? Sounds of breaking glass, Jerry dropped his bottle.
Well then what do they make appointments for if they can't keep them. Huh, hha. Look if I did that in my business I wouldn't have made a nickel.
Know body died. Jack I want you to do me a big favor. (Jerry holding up some cards looking at his father) In my garage there are a couple of boxes.
Barefoot in the clubhouse? Don't you realize this is against the rules.
(oblivious to the above) Two exact same watches. He tells you a week, and him a day. How could that be? Something's fishy about this.
(checking pants) They stole my wallet. The bum stole my wallet. (opens door, shouts into the hallway) MY WALLET'S GONE! MY WALLET'S GONE! I had my wallet in my back pocket. It's gone.
Low flow? I don't like the sound of that.
No proof? We'll get him. He's a crook, sooner or later, he'll slip up.
No, no, no. He knows how to talk to these people. No-one's gonna take advantage of Georgie. (slaps George's shoulder again)
That's right. Have you ever heard of anything like that?
Believe me, I wouldnt bother you if the army hadnt closed that base in Sarasota. Here, scribble a little something here.
Yeah. They give you a tenderloin, a salad and a baked potato, for four-ninety-five. You know what that cost you after six?
Hey! Under Siege is on again. Whose up for it?
It doesn't make a difference. They think we're in cahoots.
Bye bye. (hugging Jerry) Thanks again for the wallet.
So what did you do about the window?
( from the other room) Hey!!! They got a phone in the john here.
Well one day somebody's going to sleep on that thing and we'll get sued. I hope this doctor knows what he's doing.
Six hundred and sixty-three dollars and forty-five cents. And that's figuring conservatively at five percent interest, over fifty-three years, compounded quarterly. Or, if you put it into a ten-year T-bill...
What did you have? You had the minute steak?
(comes to the kitchen and with a loud voice) Why are you whispering?
I haven't been able to reach him. Hey I'll call him right now.
You gotta pull on the knob as you turn it.
Jack can afford to give away a pen with all his money. Believe me. He gives me a check for 19.45. He didn't have a Coke. Ho, ho, ho!
Jerry have you ever seen any of those impressionist paintings?
I'm not interested in the X-Rays. I want my money back. Somebody stole my wallet. I had $225 in there.
Maybe we can get an army transport flight. They got a base in Sarasota, I think.
(to the crowd) He gave my son a pen, and then he takes it back. Tell them about that!
Oh, that one. She's been a member of the board longer than anybody. She's very tough to deal with.
Because the Costanzas are moving into Del Boca Vista.
Ahh! Ahh! So YOU got the scotch tape! I've been looking all over for it!
There are twenty people on the board. Thank God you can get that deal.
Because of his moths you're not buying my raincoats?
(opening his tracksuit top) See what I'm wearing?
Youve got your degree. They dont care. They just want to see something.
Doesnt sound like youre friends to me. If you were friends you'd-youd ask her for the number. Do you know where this other one works?
Finder's fee is ten percent and no more.
You know what this means, dont you? We lost the Supersaver. Those tickets are non-refundable.
He never even called Ed Roydlick. They were looking for someone!
Well, she cant be too mad. Shes still coming to the wedding.
How would you feel if we sold the Cadillac?
I am not interested in his diagnosis. He's a bum.
Yes, I'm sure. I went in to get my X-Ray, Somebody takes my wallet. Is that the operation here?
(to Leo) I don't understand this jeweller, Jimmy Sherman. (indicates Jerry) He brings in a watch, it takes over a week to fix. He fixed yours in one day.
So why dont you ask someone who was at the party?
You know what my greatest moment was, dont you? Nineteen-forty-six. I went to work for Harry Flemming and I came up with the idea for the beltless trenchcoat.
(depressed) You know what this funerals gonna wind up costing me? Oh boy!
Alright alright, goodbye. (Morty hangs up the phone, Jack hangs up the phone) I don't think we are gonna make that flight.
I came home one night, and I tripped over one of Jerry's toys. (Jerry smiling points to himself and nods with cards in his hands) So I took out my belt just to threaten him, and I got a glimpse of myself in the mirror.
They're not kicking me out. You don't have the votes.
Oh, yeah, I'll be lying on an X-Ray table with my wallet in my mouth.
No-one's ever been impeached before. I couldn't live here. We'd have to move to Boca.
Jerry, I wanna tell you that meal was the worst.
I sure did. Raincoats were my business. The Executive was a classic, these haven't been made in twenty years.
The service was slow. And God forbid they should refill the water. How does 12.4% sound?
What're you talking about? You had a cheque bounce at the bodega.
That's what the city's turning into. They'll steal anything.
Oh! Oh! That feels good. Hey! This guy charges a hundred bucks an hour but I'm telling ya he's worth every penny OOOOHH!
Maybe a couple of muscle relaxers would help.
Don't you think he had to be uh near sighted? I mean know body would paint like that if they could see. It's all out of focus.
He's not gonna return the pen. That's ridiculous.
From Maryland. The one who brought you the chocolate covered cherries you didnt like.
Look, I don't want anything to go wrong. If this woman votes to impeach me, I'll be a laughing stock.
No, no put it away . . .
So, when do I get to see the doctor?
This is my son Jerry, from New York. (leaning toward Sid) He thinks he can lift more than Izzy.
Now Jerry please, do not do this to your father. Over my dead body Jerry. I'll tell you right now, you're not going to do it.
You got enough here for a life sentence.
No, your mother found it. Son, this is the most wonderful and thoughtful thing you've ever done for me.
Hey Jerry. Number One here. Did you go see Izzy at the back specialist?
Attaboy! Helen, Jerry got me a hot Wizard computer!
Who's off the street? I'm in the raincoat business for thirty-five years.
I'll tell you how crazy I am, I'm gonna pay for this whole trip with these coats.
My son never stole anything. He's a good boy.
I dont know how youre going to be comfortable like that.
(Morty goes on louder! Did he ever whisper in any episode? -) Why do you need more friends? You've got plenty of friends.
Just do it first thing tomorrow. I need it.
(looking around) This is some office. What's the square footage?
George is right. Those people will try to get away with murder. Believe me. They're all crooks.
I tell you, he bought it for me!
(to George as he is about to leave) Hey give 'em our best though.
He doesnt want to ask Elaine for the number.
What kind of clip joint are ya running here?
That's giving it away. This is a one of a kind item.
So that night I cut off the loops and the Executive was born.
You know Jack, do me a favor will you? Take the pen and the scotch tape, and get the hell out of here!
Cheap fabric, and dim lighting. That's how you move merchandise.
Alright. Next thing on the agenda, the restoration of the fence at the Briarwood gate. At the present time, we are still accepting bids.
Hey, these are very comfortable pants. You know what I paid for these Jerry?
Jerry, I'll tell ya. The first thing I'm gonna do when I get back to Florida is take a shower.
(coming into the hall) This is the home stretch. Tomorrow's the election!
Hey! You know what these cost, they're like 80 cents a nut.
