HaAhhh! The Velcro. I can't stand Velcro. It's that t-e-a-r-I-n-g sound. I used to be in raincoats. I refused to put that in any of my lines.
You see, he had the right idea. Hold out. That's how you get the big money, huh George? (slaps George on the shoulder)
Don't worry. I'll get to the other functions. (trying to open it) I can't get it open.
No proof? We'll get him. He's a crook, sooner or later, he'll slip up.
How the hell do you work this thing?
I'll tell you how crazy I am, I'm gonna pay for this whole trip with these coats.
Well, I sold raincoats in the garment centre for thirty-eight years. In nineteen forty-nine...
Just a second. (Goes to grab the phone)
(to Helen) Slept on the job? (she shushed him)
There are twenty people on the board. Thank God you can get that deal.
You don't understand. I can't allow my son to pay for me. Look, as soon as I get back to Florida, I promise you I'll mail you a check.
I want to know what kind of an office this is where you can't leave your pants in the room. You tell me.
Well, maybe you better make a pot of tea, too.
Good. O.K. (the photographer walks away) What about last year when I took him to the hospital every day? Did he ever say thank you?
(from outside the door; singing) I could have danced all night (entering with Helen) I could have danced all night and still have
You won't regret this, Miss Benes. What time should I be in? I get up at four, I could be here as early as four twenty-five.
(trying to press the cheque on Jerry) And we want you to have the money.
I don't have it. I'll mail you one.
(eating lunch with Helen and Jerry) Another fine meal, and now for my Wizard tip calculator.
Oh! Oh! That feels good. Hey! This guy charges a hundred bucks an hour but I'm telling ya he's worth every penny OOOOHH!
What are you talking about? What was I supposed to hide it somewhere?
So, when do I get to see the doctor?
Hey! I do you like this? Huh, huh!
Ahh! Ahh! So YOU got the scotch tape! I've been looking all over for it!
No-one's ever been impeached before. I couldn't live here. We'd have to move to Boca.
From Maryland. The one who brought you the chocolate covered cherries you didnt like.
Aw! Aw! Oh my back! Oh my back! It's that bar. Who the hell could sleep on that thing?
Say those are some nice pants. I got a pair just like them at home.
Don't tell me about business! I sold raincoats for thirty-five years!
You don't understand, you gotta have a buffer zone.
So what did you do about the window?
Look, I don't want anything to go wrong. If this woman votes to impeach me, I'll be a laughing stock.
Oh, you don't see. You don't see. Well it happened. Believe me.
How the hell am I gonna pay for this?
(holding Jerry's shoulders) Jerry lives in New York. You just came from New York, didn't you?
They're not kicking me out. You don't have the votes.
Well, we just bought a new place down there.
(to Helen) You don't want it? Are you kidding?
Because we had a buyer, and we couldn't get a free flight until now.
What? Im gonna buy a new sport jacket now?
(noticing Kramer's coat) Look at that, Helen do you see what he's wearing? That's the Executive.
(determined) Well, he's not getting away with this!
Those are my coats. I saved them, I stored them, I've been waiting years for this pay off.
(Morty gets up) Oh! I forgot all about it.
Jerry, what time do we have to be at the the Tonight Show on Thursday.
Who's off the street? I'm in the raincoat business for thirty-five years.
(to Leo) I don't understand this jeweller, Jimmy Sherman. (indicates Jerry) He brings in a watch, it takes over a week to fix. He fixed yours in one day.
Well one day somebody's going to sleep on that thing and we'll get sued. I hope this doctor knows what he's doing.
Jack is emceeing tomorrow. He's in charge of the whole thing.
I dont know how youre going to be comfortable like that.
He doesnt want to ask Elaine for the number.
Bye bye. (hugging Jerry) Thanks again for the wallet.
(to George as he is about to leave) Hey give 'em our best though.
What kind of clip joint are ya running here?
Hoh, here he is. This is the man I wanted you to see. Izzy Mandelbaum. He's eighty years old, but strong as an ox. (pointing) Watch this.
Your mother doesn't like my taste in clothing.
Alright. Next thing on the agenda, the restoration of the fence at the Briarwood gate. At the present time, we are still accepting bids.
So, I can use it in the restaurant to figure out the tip?
First Leo breaks up, then he goes back. What the hell's going on?
That's giving it away. This is a one of a kind item.
Would you excuse me please, we're conducting business here.
(loud) Tell them when you took my son's pen back. Tell them about that! (he gets up)
My son never stole anything. He's a good boy.
I'm very comfortable working outta the house. I have a phone, we have a Kinko's nearby. You know, I think that my resume speaks for itself.
No, we just came for the funeral. `
Well you don't have to retract it because we never went.
That had nothing to do with it, the man was out of shape.
(rushing to his bedroom) First, I need a nap.
Do you know what the interest on that fifty dollars comes to over fifty-three years?
Anyway there are these three big boxes, you can't miss them. I want you to ship them here to New York for me.
You know I've been thinking, why is Kramer getting twenty-five percent?
Look at this! Look at this! (excited) You bought a Cadillac?!
That's right. My son bought it for me.
(to the crowd) He gave my son a pen, and then he takes it back. Tell them about that!
(Jerry comes out of his room, having just woken up) Rise and shine, sleepy head! Ha ha!
Maybe we can get an army transport flight. They got a base in Sarasota, I think.
Well, I, as your president, have to find the best price, and right now, I for one, do not think it's cost-feasible.
I sure did. Raincoats were my business. The Executive was a classic, these haven't been made in twenty years.
Helen, did you know that they tape this thing in the afternoon?
Barefoot in the clubhouse? Don't you realize this is against the rules.
I keep telling her it's like an oven in here.
Jerry have you ever seen any of those impressionist paintings?
What are you talking? Jeffrey works for the parks department!
Hi, Morty Seinfeld. I have a two o'clock appointment.
I'm sorry Leo's moving back here. I'm not ready to go back to Florida.
because she puts up such a big stink every time I have a piece of meat.
He thought he could buy back that Cadillac for us? He's not getting away with that.
Believe me, I wouldnt bother you if the army hadnt closed that base in Sarasota. Here, scribble a little something here.
Because the Costanzas are moving into Del Boca Vista.
I'll call Jack Klompus, he's got a key to the garage. He can send them overnight delivery.
I'm still going to Paris. I got a big deal cooking here.
Aah! (Jack leaves) The nerve of that guy! Taking back that pen. Well that's it for them.
My idiot son could open that garage door.
Low flow? I don't like the sound of that.
Hey! This is the kind of room Sinatra stays in. Hey! look , Macadamian nuts.
How was I supposed to pay? I didn't have my wallet.
You know Jack, do me a favor will you? Take the pen and the scotch tape, and get the hell out of here!
(oblivious to the above) Two exact same watches. He tells you a week, and him a day. How could that be? Something's fishy about this.
Six hundred and sixty-three dollars and forty-five cents. And that's figuring conservatively at five percent interest, over fifty-three years, compounded quarterly. Or, if you put it into a ten-year T-bill...
My son bought me the car. It's a present.
Oh, yeah, I'll be lying on an X-Ray table with my wallet in my mouth.
I'm not interested in the X-Rays. I want my money back. Somebody stole my wallet. I had $225 in there.
You don't understand fashion is cyclical this thing could come back.
Stay on 95 South to Biscayne Boulevard. Then you make a left turn. Put you blinker on immediatly, there's an abutment there. Then you're gonna merge over very quickly, but stay on Biscayne. Don't get off Biscayne. You understand me?
How would you feel if we sold the Cadillac?
Hey! Leo, get this, four movies at once; Pay Per View.
(comes to the kitchen and with a loud voice) Why are you whispering?
Well what's the difference we'll go some place else.
By the time we sit down, it'll be quarter to five.
(Morty goes on louder! Did he ever whisper in any episode? -) Why do you need more friends? You've got plenty of friends.
No, your mother found it. Son, this is the most wonderful and thoughtful thing you've ever done for me.
(coming into the hall) This is the home stretch. Tomorrow's the election!
(searching in a kitchen drawer) What happened to the scotch tape? Who takes the scotch tape? Nobody returns anything around here.
Sorbonne? Oh, hey. (To Helen) That's in Paris.
You don't say? You know I have boxes of those sitting in my garage in Florida?
What did you have? You had the minute steak?
You got enough here for a life sentence.
Jerry, I wanna tell you that meal was the worst.
Go to the building. She goes out to lunch, doesnt she?
You should be! How could you spend two hundred dollars on a tip calculator?!
You what I'll do next time? I'll hide it so nobody can find it.
They're good around the house -- and they're good for outside.
(standing) Okay, I'm done. I'll be back in the morning, when he's close to finish with his story.
(checking pants) They stole my wallet. The bum stole my wallet. (opens door, shouts into the hallway) MY WALLET'S GONE! MY WALLET'S GONE! I had my wallet in my back pocket. It's gone.
Because if you are, you shouldn't. There's nothing available in that development.
I'm sorry, we can't go back to Florida.
Twice! And Dembrow doesn't even know you. His son happens to live on your floor.
Attaboy! Helen, Jerry got me a hot Wizard computer!
Because of his moths you're not buying my raincoats?
Yeah. They give you a tenderloin, a salad and a baked potato, for four-ninety-five. You know what that cost you after six?
No, no, he won't let me do that.
Listen, is it all right if we move in with you for a little while? Sounds of breaking glass, Jerry dropped his bottle.
Well, it's getting kinda late, why don't we uh...
You gotta pull on the knob as you turn it.
(looking around) This is some office. What's the square footage?
What're you talking about? You had a cheque bounce at the bodega.
Jack can afford to give away a pen with all his money. Believe me. He gives me a check for 19.45. He didn't have a Coke. Ho, ho, ho!
(walking back out of the room) Don't tell your mother.
Jerry, this is Del Boca Vista's new physical fitness room. They got medicine balls, you can bike ride, anything you want.
Alright alright, goodbye. (Morty hangs up the phone, Jack hangs up the phone) I don't think we are gonna make that flight.
You stick up for that sofa like I'm criticizing a person.
You know what this means, dont you? We lost the Supersaver. Those tickets are non-refundable.
( from the other room) Hey!!! They got a phone in the john here.
The whole movie was in black and white.
George is right. Those people will try to get away with murder. Believe me. They're all crooks.
Yeah, looks like you're getting a little spare tire there, tiger.
All this? This whole thing? It's going to take me forty-five minutes.
Make sure Kramer uses good tape when he sends back the raincoats.
I wanna tell you. This is one of the most thoughtful gifts anyone's ever given me.
I haven't been able to reach him. Hey I'll call him right now.
(unconcerned) Ach, I never knew what the hell I was peddling with those stupid cartoons and that paper book, anyway.
You don't understand, I've come this far, I can't stop now.
Take it easy, I've been through a million of these negotiations.
He never even called Ed Roydlick. They were looking for someone!
I'll tell you what I'm looking at the next condo president of Del Boca Vista, Phase Three.
Hey, these are very comfortable pants. You know what I paid for these Jerry?
Besides, it's not stealing if it's something you need.
I say the guy was painting without his glasses.
Nothing. Batteries. (Jerry scoffs) Well, they wear out so quick.
So what, why is that worth twenty-five percent? It's a finders fee. You know what a finders fee is?
(shocked) A thousand?! I know a coupla Chinamen over there on Forty-third Street, who'll do it for half that.
They should have put that show on 5 years ago. Bunch of idiots at that network. Can I tell you something, Jerry? It's all crap on TV. The only thing I watch is Xena the Warrior Princess. She must be about six-six.
Look, if we're gonna stay here until all hours of the night, can we at least get some food here?
Just do it first thing tomorrow. I need it.
Jerry, I'll tell ya. The first thing I'm gonna do when I get back to Florida is take a shower.
That's right. Have you ever heard of anything like that?
Cheap fabric, and dim lighting. That's how you move merchandise.
Look at this. Look at how this idiot packed it. He didn't tape it, he just flipped the flaps. (Kramer, Morty and Jerry are looking around grabbing raincoats which are scattered all over the place.) Kramer you missed a couple.
The service was slow. And God forbid they should refill the water. How does 12.4% sound?
Doesnt sound like youre friends to me. If you were friends you'd-youd ask her for the number. Do you know where this other one works?
Its nothing. I got it. So, how are your levels coming along?
You know Jack, you've got a hell of a nerve taking that kid's pen.
I came home one night, and I tripped over one of Jerry's toys. (Jerry smiling points to himself and nods with cards in his hands) So I took out my belt just to threaten him, and I got a glimpse of myself in the mirror.
I told her you'd get married. She thought you'd never do it.
Aw, Jerry. I should be buyin' you presents.
Hey! Under Siege is on again. Whose up for it?
I dont know her either. (gesturing to Helen) She makes me fly all the way from Florida for this, and then she criticizes my jacket.
Hey Jerry. Number One here. Did you go see Izzy at the back specialist?
Well, if he fixes my back I'll be happy. . . . (back to the form) Have you ever had a sexually transmitted disease? That's IT! . . . Here, you got my name, you got my address. That's enough.
It doesn't make a difference. They think we're in cahoots.
(depressed) You know what this funerals gonna wind up costing me? Oh boy!
Look, I got a few good years left. If I want a Chip Ahoy, I'm having it.
No, no, no. He knows how to talk to these people. No-one's gonna take advantage of Georgie. (slaps George's shoulder again)
No, no put it away . . .
(getting up from the table and coming over) Why is that?
This is my son Jerry, from New York. (leaning toward Sid) He thinks he can lift more than Izzy.
I am not interested in his diagnosis. He's a bum.
All right, all right, Let's go already. They keep you in here a year. They don't give a damn. I could die in here. . . .(open the door and shouts into the hallway) Excuse me! Excuse me! What's going on? I'm here twenty minutes. Could somebody please help me.
Know body died. Jack I want you to do me a big favor. (Jerry holding up some cards looking at his father) In my garage there are a couple of boxes.
Hey Jerry, look at this. My seat's got a memory, in case somebody moves it. I could be in prison for five years. I come out, my seat goes right back to where I like it.
Finder's fee is ten percent and no more.
You dont understand, Ive never paid a full fare.
That's the second time you said "personal favor". Why do you keep saying that?
(opening his tracksuit top) See what I'm wearing?
Now Jerry please, do not do this to your father. Over my dead body Jerry. I'll tell you right now, you're not going to do it.
Maybe a couple of muscle relaxers would help.
This is a huge scandal! We need damage control.
Oh my God! What the hell happened to you?
I tell you, he bought it for me!
Helen, we got into restaurants and figure out the tips.
You know what my greatest moment was, dont you? Nineteen-forty-six. I went to work for Harry Flemming and I came up with the idea for the beltless trenchcoat.
You gotta jiggle it a little bit. I jiggled it. I jiggled it for fifteen minutes.
I got a guarantee on that watch. Give it to me, I'll take it back to where we got it.
Where do you come off with this crap?
Hey! Look at this, a wallet. Exactly what I needed, y'see.
So that night I cut off the loops and the Executive was born.
Look at this. It's a book. Employer's address. Whydo they need this? You know I never had a back problem until that night I slept on the convertible sofa. (hu hu) My back was fine.
Only twenty-five minutes a day, and you can attach it to any doorknob.
Oh my God! She's gotta make a big deal out of everything.
(standing) Okay. Tomorrow, Jerry and I will visit Izzy and apologise. Now, goodnight.
Morty Seinfeld. I cut velvet for forty years with Harry Altman.
Youve got your degree. They dont care. They just want to see something.
Well then what do they make appointments for if they can't keep them. Huh, hha. Look if I did that in my business I wouldn't have made a nickel.
