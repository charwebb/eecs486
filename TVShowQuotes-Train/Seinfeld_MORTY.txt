(eating lunch with Helen and Jerry) Another fine meal, and now for my Wizard tip calculator.
You're a terrific kid.
I keep telling her it's like an oven in here.
Don't you think he had to be uh near sighted? I mean know body would paint like that if they could see. It's all out of focus.
Oh, yeah. I forgot all about it.
You sell clothes here, don't you?
(looking around) This is some office. What's the square footage?
Yeah.
Hello
No, no, he won't let me do that.
So, I can use it in the restaurant to figure out the tip?
Plum...(Jerry hangs up.)
It doesn't make a difference. They think we're in cahoots.
So, how did she find out?
How about Loni Anderson?
George is right. Those people will try to get away with murder. Believe me. They're all crooks.
Hiya Kramer.
Because we had a buyer, and we couldn't get a free flight until now.
And every morning I eat a plum.
You're packing cereal?
Low flow? I don't like the sound of that.
Ah, he's deaf anyway.
Are you ready for dessert?
Doesnt sound like youre friends to me. If you were friends you'd-youd ask her for the number. Do you know where this other one works?
You shoulda told me it didn't work.
Stop it.
Do you know what the interest on that fifty dollars comes to over fifty-three years?
You should be! How could you spend two hundred dollars on a tip calculator?!
What are you talking? Jeffrey works for the parks department!
What was that?
He'll send them express.
They stole my wallet.
That's right, they're my coats.
(getting up from the table and coming over) Why is that?
Outside? What's going on?
Youve got your degree. They dont care. They just want to see something.
Whats wrong with it?
We're keeping it.
Jack can afford to give away a pen with all his money. Believe me. He gives me a check for 19.45. He didn't have a Coke. Ho, ho, ho!
Aw! Aw! Oh my back! Oh my back! It's that bar. Who the hell could sleep on that thing?
Hey, Jerry.
Look, I got a few good years left. If I want a Chip Ahoy, I'm having it.
They'll be here first thing Thursday morning.
Hello Rachel.
We'll see.
Stealing?!
I wanna tell you. This is one of the most thoughtful gifts anyone's ever given me.
Just watch me do my thing.
Hey! Leo, get this, four movies at once; Pay Per View.
I'll sleep standing up. I'll be fine.
( from the other room) Hey!!! They got a phone in the john here.
Don't lie Jerry.
What's all that?
This looks like too much money.
(from outside the door; singing) I could have danced all night (entering with Helen) I could have danced all night and still have
Hey, Georgie-boy, how are ya?
They should have put that show on 5 years ago. Bunch of idiots at that network. Can I tell you something, Jerry? It's all crap on TV. The only thing I watch is Xena the Warrior Princess. She must be about six-six.
So what, why is that worth twenty-five percent? It's a finders fee. You know what a finders fee is?
Got lucky.
How come he gets to leave?
What are you talking about? What was I supposed to hide it somewhere?
nan
Sorbonne? Oh, hey. (To Helen) That's in Paris.
Raincoats.
Hey! This is the kind of room Sinatra stays in. Hey! look , Macadamian nuts.
Ok it's a deal
I told you to send them express.
(oblivious to the above) Two exact same watches. He tells you a week, and him a day. How could that be? Something's fishy about this.
Where do you come off with this crap?
This is a huge scandal! We need damage control.
You didn't give it to him.
First Leo breaks up, then he goes back. What the hell's going on?
Astronaut!
(to Leo) I don't understand this jeweller, Jimmy Sherman. (indicates Jerry) He brings in a watch, it takes over a week to fix. He fixed yours in one day.
You know what this means, dont you? We lost the Supersaver. Those tickets are non-refundable.
You don't say? You know I have boxes of those sitting in my garage in Florida?
Stay on 95 South to Biscayne Boulevard. Then you make a left turn. Put you blinker on immediatly, there's an abutment there. Then you're gonna merge over very quickly, but stay on Biscayne. Don't get off Biscayne. You understand me?
Well what's the difference we'll go some place else.
What are you worried about?
Jerry, this is Del Boca Vista's new physical fitness room. They got medicine balls, you can bike ride, anything you want.
Say those are some nice pants. I got a pair just like them at home.
Hey, George!
(noticing Kramer's coat) Look at that, Helen do you see what he's wearing? That's the Executive.
He thought he could buy back that Cadillac for us? He's not getting away with that.
That's terrific!
Nobody uses it.
They give you that *Fish.*
See that? You couldn't do that.
He could wash them.
(to Helen) You don't want it? Are you kidding?
(Jerry comes out of his room, having just woken up) Rise and shine, sleepy head! Ha ha!
Jack is emceeing tomorrow. He's in charge of the whole thing.
Who is it?
It's Morty
I'm sorry, we can't go back to Florida.
(unpanicked) There's already an ambulance here for Mrs Glickman. There's room for one more.
How would you feel if we sold the Cadillac?
Hey, I agree with him. Nobody likes a kid with a pony.
Boy that was some show.
Well, she cant be too mad. Shes still coming to the wedding.
Yeah. They give you a tenderloin, a salad and a baked potato, for four-ninety-five. You know what that cost you after six?
You didn't get in?
You're out of your mind.
Yeah, looks like you're getting a little spare tire there, tiger.
You know that number?
What about the end, with the list?
Jerry, I'll tell ya. The first thing I'm gonna do when I get back to Florida is take a shower.
(holding Jerry's shoulders) Jerry lives in New York. You just came from New York, didn't you?
Oh come on!
There are twenty people on the board. Thank God you can get that deal.
Maybe he doesn't like Ted Danson.
When are we gonna tell Jerry?
Don't worry about it.
My idiot son could open that garage door.
Oh my God! What the hell happened to you?
If anything you're getting too much.
So why dont you ask someone who was at the party?
I'm gonna explain what boxes.
(still loud) What about her?
Hello.
I thought you forgot about me.
I say the guy was painting without his glasses.
How're your folks?
Well you're not getting thirty-five.
19.45$ ?
All right, all right.
Well, we just bought a new place down there.
Hello.
What're you talking about?
Anyway there are these three big boxes, you can't miss them. I want you to ship them here to New York for me.
Its nothing. I got it. So, how are your levels coming along?
Alright, Leo.
(surprised) President?
Jerry, you ever watch that?
Jerry, what time do we have to be at the the Tonight Show on Thursday.
I came home one night, and I tripped over one of Jerry's toys. (Jerry smiling points to himself and nods with cards in his hands) So I took out my belt just to threaten him, and I got a glimpse of myself in the mirror.
What are you talking about? I'm the one who should have called the police. They stole my wallet.
Aah! (Jack leaves) The nerve of that guy! Taking back that pen. Well that's it for them.
Twenty minutes. I've been waiting twenty minutes.
Hey, Mr. Kramer. Ha ha ha.
So much the better.
Uh we'll drive around for a while.
Twice! And Dembrow doesn't even know you. His son happens to live on your floor.
Call an ambulance.
(to the crowd) He gave my son a pen, and then he takes it back. Tell them about that!
He gave him the pen.
(searching in a kitchen drawer) What happened to the scotch tape? Who takes the scotch tape? Nobody returns anything around here.
So, you stand in the lobby, by the elevator, and wait for her to come down for lunch.
Tomorrow afternoon?
Helen, did you know that they tape this thing in the afternoon?
What nervous?
What'ya got leather seats here?
What do you want?
You dont understand, Ive never paid a full fare.
Will you stop it Jerry. Let go.
Hey! Look at this, a wallet. Exactly what I needed, y'see.
Hey, Mr. Kramer!
This was a gift from my son.
Alright Jer.
So ask Elaine there for her number.
Leo, I'm listening to Leo now!
I wanted a Chip Ahoy.
I'm sorry Leo's moving back here. I'm not ready to go back to Florida.
Yes, I do!
What're you doing? Are you making coffee?
(indicating) So, how d'you like this?
Leave all my stuff here?
Ahh! Ahh! So YOU got the scotch tape! I've been looking all over for it!
Aw, Jerry. I should be buyin' you presents.
You won't regret this, Miss Benes. What time should I be in? I get up at four, I could be here as early as four twenty-five.
It's too much car, Jerry.
Jack have some spong cake.
That's giving it away. This is a one of a kind item.
(without looking up) Who are they?
Alright, let's get going.
(determined) Well, he's not getting away with this!
Get out of here.
Listen, is it all right if we move in with you for a little while? Sounds of breaking glass, Jerry dropped his bottle.
I sure did. Raincoats were my business. The Executive was a classic, these haven't been made in twenty years.
Look at this. It's a book. Employer's address. Whydo they need this? You know I never had a back problem until that night I slept on the convertible sofa. (hu hu) My back was fine.
You don't understand, I've come this far, I can't stop now.
Because if you are, you shouldn't. There's nothing available in that development.
I'm not talking loud!
Oh, for Gods sake!
Send them tomorrow.
You don't understand fashion is cyclical this thing could come back.
You gotta deal.
because she puts up such a big stink every time I have a piece of meat.
Yeah, so?
(unconcerned) Ach, I never knew what the hell I was peddling with those stupid cartoons and that paper book, anyway.
Astronaut?
So look.
The service was slow. And God forbid they should refill the water. How does 12.4% sound?
What're you talking about? You had a cheque bounce at the bodega.
I'll call Jack Klompus, he's got a key to the garage. He can send them overnight delivery.
From Maryland. The one who brought you the chocolate covered cherries you didnt like.
You what I'll do next time? I'll hide it so nobody can find it.
Well one day somebody's going to sleep on that thing and we'll get sued. I hope this doctor knows what he's doing.
You know what my greatest moment was, dont you? Nineteen-forty-six. I went to work for Harry Flemming and I came up with the idea for the beltless trenchcoat.
You didn't have a deal?
So, what are you? Afraid of her?
Oh, it's George.
This is some building, Harry Fleming used to have an office here. There was a deli on the first floor. You don't get corned beef like that anymore. What happened to that deli?
Look, I don't want anything to go wrong. If this woman votes to impeach me, I'll be a laughing stock.
Hey Jerry. Number One here. Did you go see Izzy at the back specialist?
I'll make a few phone calls.
I wouldn't give him the satisfaction.
Attaboy! Helen, Jerry got me a hot Wizard computer!
Jerry have you ever seen any of those impressionist paintings?
What are you, nuts?
Well, if he fixes my back I'll be happy. . . . (back to the form) Have you ever had a sexually transmitted disease? That's IT! . . . Here, you got my name, you got my address. That's enough.
I don't have it. I'll mail you one.
So bring a snack-pack.
Ok, let's go.
Yeah, yeah, you make money.
Hey! You know what these cost, they're like 80 cents a nut.
I told her you'd get married. She thought you'd never do it.
Don't tell me about business! I sold raincoats for thirty-five years!
That's a good idea.
By the time we sit down, it'll be quarter to five.
What the hell is going on here?
I don't see envelopes!
What are you talking about?
(standing) Okay, I'm done. I'll be back in the morning, when he's close to finish with his story.
Hey! Under Siege is on again. Whose up for it?
Only twenty-five minutes a day, and you can attach it to any doorknob.
Nothing. Batteries. (Jerry scoffs) Well, they wear out so quick.
(opening his tracksuit top) See what I'm wearing?
What? Im gonna buy a new sport jacket now?
I retract your retraction.
What's not to understand?
Yea
(simultaneous) Hey!/That's wonderful!/We got a deal!
No, no put it away . . .
Hello Jack.
My son bought me the car. It's a present.
Hey Jerry, look at this. My seat's got a memory, in case somebody moves it. I could be in prison for five years. I come out, my seat goes right back to where I like it.
His pen.
Maybe we can get an army transport flight. They got a base in Sarasota, I think.
You just heard about this today?
How the hell do you work this thing?
You said you didn't want it!
What?
Alright, are you ready to eat?
You stick up for that sofa like I'm criticizing a person.
(skeptical) Thousands?!
I dont know her either. (gesturing to Helen) She makes me fly all the way from Florida for this, and then she criticizes my jacket.
Could you believe that guy?
Then who the hell said you couldn't have any? I mean what the hell do I care whether you have sponge cake?
I don't think we even use it.
What kind of clip joint are ya running here?
Well, it's getting kinda late, why don't we uh...
Bye, Jer.
Jerry, I wanna tell you that meal was the worst.
Your mother doesn't like my taste in clothing.
Jerry, don't go.
We saw Regis Philbin get out of a limousine.
(to Helen) Slept on the job? (she shushed him)
Nervous, Jack?
We got plenty of time.
What did you have? You had the minute steak?
You send me the bill.
D'you realise, an above-average performing growth mutual fund for fifty-three years...
Hello?
No, your mother found it. Son, this is the most wonderful and thoughtful thing you've ever done for me.
That's right. Have you ever heard of anything like that?
Yknow Jerry, its a good thing I wasnt so particular.
Helen, will you stop bothering him.
Yeah. This is all big crepe money.
Why would he mind? We're his parents.
Make sure Kramer uses good tape when he sends back the raincoats.
What the hell are you looking for?
What did you say?
(to Jerry) You remember Jack and Doris?
Hi, Morty Seinfeld. I have a two o'clock appointment.
So, howd you do?
I knew it, I told you!
Jack Klompus gave us six grand.
Leo, let's go.
Oooh! Heh heh! It's a radar detector.
(walking back out of the room) Don't tell your mother.
That didn't sound like the Golden Nugget.
Helen, we got into restaurants and figure out the tips.
Hello Elaine
Hey, thats some big job.
(rushing to his bedroom) First, I need a nap.
You don't understand, you gotta have a buffer zone.
And smart! Like a computer!
What are you kidding me?
Well, maybe you better make a pot of tea, too.
Hello Elaine
Not really.
Tell him to eat a plum.
(indicates the new wallet) It's velcro.
All right, Leo.
We'll round down.
I got a guarantee on that watch. Give it to me, I'll take it back to where we got it.
No-one's ever been impeached before. I couldn't live here. We'd have to move to Boca.
Boy, you are really something.
Hello. Hello, Mrs Choate.
My son never stole anything. He's a good boy.
Bring me the receipt.
So, what took you so long?
He doesnt want to ask Elaine for the number.
(shout) Jerry!
Aha!
You know I've been thinking, why is Kramer getting twenty-five percent?
You gotta pull on the knob as you turn it.
Jerry's a comedian.
You think it's hot?
Quones not a word.
I haven't been able to reach him. Hey I'll call him right now.
Ya so have I
Barefoot in the clubhouse? Don't you realize this is against the rules.
Pinko Commie rag.
I got my sport jacket.
Ah, good-bye.
Come on. That's enough, sit down!
(to the chiro) Who are you?
Because I have the votes.
What leg work?
Oh, you don't see. You don't see. Well it happened. Believe me.
Welcome to Florida!
I'm very comfortable working outta the house. I have a phone, we have a Kinko's nearby. You know, I think that my resume speaks for itself.
yeah, he's supposed to be the emcee.
Ok, bye.
Ill get it!
HaAhhh! The Velcro. I can't stand Velcro. It's that t-e-a-r-I-n-g sound. I used to be in raincoats. I refused to put that in any of my lines.
You know Jack, you've got a hell of a nerve taking that kid's pen.
(comes to the kitchen and with a loud voice) Why are you whispering?
Just do it first thing tomorrow. I need it.
That's right. They went like hotcakes.
I am not interested in his diagnosis. He's a bum.
The whole movie was in black and white.
Plus the insurance.
Congratulations, Mr. President.
(laughs) Heh hah!
I don't want it!
All right. Make it 20 bucks.
(depressed) You know what this funerals gonna wind up costing me? Oh boy!
So, when do I get to see the doctor?
Well, I, as your president, have to find the best price, and right now, I for one, do not think it's cost-feasible.
He never even called Ed Roydlick. They were looking for someone!
He pretends he bumped into her!
But there are no stamps on these.
You what? You bought me a Cadillac?
This is it.
You gotta jiggle it a little bit. I jiggled it. I jiggled it for fifteen minutes.
That's right. My son bought it for me.
We're going with a select charter group.
Number One, signing off.
Jerry!
Don't worry. I'll get to the other functions. (trying to open it) I can't get it open.
Maybe you should see a doctor.
Go to the building. She goes out to lunch, doesnt she?
I dont know how youre going to be comfortable like that.
Because of his moths you're not buying my raincoats?
Yeah, while I was in getting X-Rayed.
I want to know what kind of an office this is where you can't leave your pants in the room. You tell me.
She's got priors.
Would you excuse me please, we're conducting business here.
You see, he had the right idea. Hold out. That's how you get the big money, huh George? (slaps George on the shoulder)
Why, whats wrong with Loni Anderson?
(Morty goes on louder! Did he ever whisper in any episode? -) Why do you need more friends? You've got plenty of friends.
(on the phone) Hello Jack.
Well you don't have to retract it because we never went.
You broke the window?
Alright. Next thing on the agenda, the restoration of the fence at the Briarwood gate. At the present time, we are still accepting bids.
You don't think it's fair.
C'mon, take a ride.
Who's off the street? I'm in the raincoat business for thirty-five years.
(to George as he is about to leave) Hey give 'em our best though.
Because the Costanzas are moving into Del Boca Vista.
Are you kidding? They built the lake.
(loud) Tell them when you took my son's pen back. Tell them about that! (he gets up)
Nothing nothing.
I was never impeached! I resigned!
Believe me, I wouldnt bother you if the army hadnt closed that base in Sarasota. Here, scribble a little something here.
I'm ready
Who's Mr Fancy?
We'll take a bus.
It's mine.
Hoh, here he is. This is the man I wanted you to see. Izzy Mandelbaum. He's eighty years old, but strong as an ox. (pointing) Watch this.
Maybe some people don't like him. I could see that.
That's what the city's turning into. They'll steal anything.
(standing) Okay. Tomorrow, Jerry and I will visit Izzy and apologise. Now, goodnight.
All right, all right, Let's go already. They keep you in here a year. They don't give a damn. I could die in here. . . .(open the door and shouts into the hallway) Excuse me! Excuse me! What's going on? I'm here twenty minutes. Could somebody please help me.
My son bought me that car!
Why not?
No no, the luggage is on the program. I got a brick in here.
Maybe a couple of muscle relaxers would help.
Tell your parents we said 'Hi!' (They leave)
Morty Seinfeld. I cut velvet for forty years with Harry Altman.
So that night I cut off the loops and the Executive was born.
(dismissive) Ahh!
Hey, these are very comfortable pants. You know what I paid for these Jerry?
Izzy used to work out with Charles Atlas in the fifties.
They're not kicking me out. You don't have the votes.
Those are my coats. I saved them, I stored them, I've been waiting years for this pay off.
Oh! Oh! That feels good. Hey! This guy charges a hundred bucks an hour but I'm telling ya he's worth every penny OOOOHH!
You believe this?
You got enough here for a life sentence.
I'm not interested in the X-Rays. I want my money back. Somebody stole my wallet. I had $225 in there.
What's the difference, we'll figure something out.
How could you not get the insurance?
Daily what?
Somebody had a coke.
I'll tell you what I'm looking at the next condo president of Del Boca Vista, Phase Three.
You wanna take a ride?
That had nothing to do with it, the man was out of shape.
They're good around the house -- and they're good for outside.
Cheap fabric, and dim lighting. That's how you move merchandise.
I'm paying.
Take it easy, I've been through a million of these negotiations.
No, no, no. He knows how to talk to these people. No-one's gonna take advantage of Georgie. (slaps George's shoulder again)
What do you mean?
This isn't a Wizard, it's a Willard.
Who's that?
Look, if we're gonna stay here until all hours of the night, can we at least get some food here?
Now Jerry please, do not do this to your father. Over my dead body Jerry. I'll tell you right now, you're not going to do it.
Oh, well...
You don't understand my...
Oh, that one. She's been a member of the board longer than anybody. She's very tough to deal with.
Oh, yeah, I'll be lying on an X-Ray table with my wallet in my mouth.
What?
I'm thinking more like fifteen.
How was I supposed to pay? I didn't have my wallet.
What?
Good. O.K. (the photographer walks away) What about last year when I took him to the hospital every day? Did he ever say thank you?
Yes, I'm sure. I went in to get my X-Ray, Somebody takes my wallet. Is that the operation here?
The Mandelbaums own the Magic Pan restaurants.
"My Fair Lady"
Why the hell didn't you tell us?
That's the second time you said "personal favor". Why do you keep saying that?
Bye, Mr. Kramer.
Look at this! Look at this! (excited) You bought a Cadillac?!
Maybe I should talk to Elaine.
Oh my God! She's gotta make a big deal out of everything.
Ah, there he is!
Nice to see you, Mrs Choate.
You know Jack, do me a favor will you? Take the pen and the scotch tape, and get the hell out of here!
Besides, it's not stealing if it's something you need.
Look at this. Look at how this idiot packed it. He didn't tape it, he just flipped the flaps. (Kramer, Morty and Jerry are looking around grabbing raincoats which are scattered all over the place.) Kramer you missed a couple.
This is my son Jerry, from New York. (leaning toward Sid) He thinks he can lift more than Izzy.
Depends on the firm.
So what did you do about the window?
(checking pants) They stole my wallet. The bum stole my wallet. (opens door, shouts into the hallway) MY WALLET'S GONE! MY WALLET'S GONE! I had my wallet in my back pocket. It's gone.
What are you talking? We use it.
Well we do.
How the hell am I gonna pay for this?
Helen, did you pack my travel gym?
(Morty gets up) Oh! I forgot all about it.
I tell you, he bought it for me!
Well, I sold raincoats in the garment centre for thirty-eight years. In nineteen forty-nine...
Finder's fee is ten percent and no more.
You don't even think about it, there's so much going on.
Should I pick up?
Did you send them?
(to Jack, loud) That's what you say.
This shirt will never leave my body.
