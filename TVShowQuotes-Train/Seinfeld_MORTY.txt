No, no put it away . . .
(to George as he is about to leave) Hey give 'em our best though.
Go to the building. She goes out to lunch, doesnt she?
That's giving it away. This is a one of a kind item.
Take it easy, I've been through a million of these negotiations.
They're good around the house -- and they're good for outside.
(noticing Kramer's coat) Look at that, Helen do you see what he's wearing? That's the Executive.
You don't understand fashion is cyclical this thing could come back.
Bye bye. (hugging Jerry) Thanks again for the wallet.
Don't tell me about business! I sold raincoats for thirty-five years!
(to Helen) You don't want it? Are you kidding?
What? Im gonna buy a new sport jacket now?
The service was slow. And God forbid they should refill the water. How does 12.4% sound?
Morty Seinfeld. I cut velvet for forty years with Harry Altman.
We saw Regis Philbin get out of a limousine.
I keep telling her it's like an oven in here.
(trying to press the cheque on Jerry) And we want you to have the money.
He's not gonna return the pen. That's ridiculous.
This is a huge scandal! We need damage control.
Hoh, here he is. This is the man I wanted you to see. Izzy Mandelbaum. He's eighty years old, but strong as an ox. (pointing) Watch this.
That had nothing to do with it, the man was out of shape.
(holding Jerry's shoulders) Jerry lives in New York. You just came from New York, didn't you?
D'you realise, an above-average performing growth mutual fund for fifty-three years...
You know what the flight backll cost us?
because she puts up such a big stink every time I have a piece of meat.
Well, she cant be too mad. Shes still coming to the wedding.
Helen, did you know that they tape this thing in the afternoon?
(standing) Okay. Tomorrow, Jerry and I will visit Izzy and apologise. Now, goodnight.
I want to know what kind of an office this is where you can't leave your pants in the room. You tell me.
I tell you, he bought it for me!
You what I'll do next time? I'll hide it so nobody can find it.
So what, why is that worth twenty-five percent? It's a finders fee. You know what a finders fee is?
Because we had a buyer, and we couldn't get a free flight until now.
That's right. Have you ever heard of anything like that?
(to Helen) Slept on the job? (she shushed him)
George is right. Those people will try to get away with murder. Believe me. They're all crooks.
You know Jack, you've got a hell of a nerve taking that kid's pen.
I'm very comfortable working outta the house. I have a phone, we have a Kinko's nearby. You know, I think that my resume speaks for itself.
So what did you do about the window?
You gotta jiggle it a little bit. I jiggled it. I jiggled it for fifteen minutes.
Make sure Kramer uses good tape when he sends back the raincoats.
How was I supposed to pay? I didn't have my wallet.
The whole movie was in black and white.
Helen, we got into restaurants and figure out the tips.
Jerry have you ever seen any of those impressionist paintings?
You know Jack, do me a favor will you? Take the pen and the scotch tape, and get the hell out of here!
Finder's fee is ten percent and no more.
Know body died. Jack I want you to do me a big favor. (Jerry holding up some cards looking at his father) In my garage there are a couple of boxes.
Hey Jerry, look at this. My seat's got a memory, in case somebody moves it. I could be in prison for five years. I come out, my seat goes right back to where I like it.
Hey! Leo, get this, four movies at once; Pay Per View.
You gotta pull on the knob as you turn it.
What are you talking about? What was I supposed to hide it somewhere?
How the hell do you work this thing?
Those are my coats. I saved them, I stored them, I've been waiting years for this pay off.
Hey! Under Siege is on again. Whose up for it?
So, when do I get to see the doctor?
(comes to the kitchen and with a loud voice) Why are you whispering?
My idiot son could open that garage door.
Attaboy! Helen, Jerry got me a hot Wizard computer!
(rushing to his bedroom) First, I need a nap.
(eating lunch with Helen and Jerry) Another fine meal, and now for my Wizard tip calculator.
They should have put that show on 5 years ago. Bunch of idiots at that network. Can I tell you something, Jerry? It's all crap on TV. The only thing I watch is Xena the Warrior Princess. She must be about six-six.
Hey Jerry. Number One here. Did you go see Izzy at the back specialist?
Listen, is it all right if we move in with you for a little while? Sounds of breaking glass, Jerry dropped his bottle.
Look at this. It's a book. Employer's address. Whydo they need this? You know I never had a back problem until that night I slept on the convertible sofa. (hu hu) My back was fine.
Jerry, I'll tell ya. The first thing I'm gonna do when I get back to Florida is take a shower.
First Leo breaks up, then he goes back. What the hell's going on?
Good. O.K. (the photographer walks away) What about last year when I took him to the hospital every day? Did he ever say thank you?
I told her you'd get married. She thought you'd never do it.
You stick up for that sofa like I'm criticizing a person.
You know I've been thinking, why is Kramer getting twenty-five percent?
Jack is emceeing tomorrow. He's in charge of the whole thing.
(checking pants) They stole my wallet. The bum stole my wallet. (opens door, shouts into the hallway) MY WALLET'S GONE! MY WALLET'S GONE! I had my wallet in my back pocket. It's gone.
(Morty gets up) Oh! I forgot all about it.
Hi, Morty Seinfeld. I have a two o'clock appointment.
I dont know how youre going to be comfortable like that.
So that night I cut off the loops and the Executive was born.
Because the Costanzas are moving into Del Boca Vista.
No, your mother found it. Son, this is the most wonderful and thoughtful thing you've ever done for me.
Don't worry. I'll get to the other functions. (trying to open it) I can't get it open.
Because if you are, you shouldn't. There's nothing available in that development.
What kind of clip joint are ya running here?
Well, we just bought a new place down there.
I don't have it. I'll mail you one.
Low flow? I don't like the sound of that.
I'll tell you what I'm looking at the next condo president of Del Boca Vista, Phase Three.
(depressed) You know what this funerals gonna wind up costing me? Oh boy!
(standing) Okay, I'm done. I'll be back in the morning, when he's close to finish with his story.
You should be! How could you spend two hundred dollars on a tip calculator?!
Hey! Look at this, a wallet. Exactly what I needed, y'see.
Then who the hell said you couldn't have any? I mean what the hell do I care whether you have sponge cake?
What did you have? You had the minute steak?
Hey, I agree with him. Nobody likes a kid with a pony.
(to Leo) I don't understand this jeweller, Jimmy Sherman. (indicates Jerry) He brings in a watch, it takes over a week to fix. He fixed yours in one day.
You know what my greatest moment was, dont you? Nineteen-forty-six. I went to work for Harry Flemming and I came up with the idea for the beltless trenchcoat.
(walking back out of the room) Don't tell your mother.
(unpanicked) There's already an ambulance here for Mrs Glickman. There's room for one more.
Youve got your degree. They dont care. They just want to see something.
You got enough here for a life sentence.
Well, if he fixes my back I'll be happy. . . . (back to the form) Have you ever had a sexually transmitted disease? That's IT! . . . Here, you got my name, you got my address. That's enough.
Oh my God! What the hell happened to you?
Yes, I'm sure. I went in to get my X-Ray, Somebody takes my wallet. Is that the operation here?
Look, if we're gonna stay here until all hours of the night, can we at least get some food here?
Well, I sold raincoats in the garment centre for thirty-eight years. In nineteen forty-nine...
Sorbonne? Oh, hey. (To Helen) That's in Paris.
He thought he could buy back that Cadillac for us? He's not getting away with that.
Well then what do they make appointments for if they can't keep them. Huh, hha. Look if I did that in my business I wouldn't have made a nickel.
By the time we sit down, it'll be quarter to five.
I haven't been able to reach him. Hey I'll call him right now.
(getting up from the table and coming over) Why is that?
Besides, it's not stealing if it's something you need.
There are twenty people on the board. Thank God you can get that deal.
So, you stand in the lobby, by the elevator, and wait for her to come down for lunch.
You won't regret this, Miss Benes. What time should I be in? I get up at four, I could be here as early as four twenty-five.
Yknow Jerry, its a good thing I wasnt so particular.
All right, all right, Let's go already. They keep you in here a year. They don't give a damn. I could die in here. . . .(open the door and shouts into the hallway) Excuse me! Excuse me! What's going on? I'm here twenty minutes. Could somebody please help me.
Maybe we can get an army transport flight. They got a base in Sarasota, I think.
I'm sorry Leo's moving back here. I'm not ready to go back to Florida.
All this? This whole thing? It's going to take me forty-five minutes.
No, no, no. He knows how to talk to these people. No-one's gonna take advantage of Georgie. (slaps George's shoulder again)
You dont understand, Ive never paid a full fare.
Only twenty-five minutes a day, and you can attach it to any doorknob.
No proof? We'll get him. He's a crook, sooner or later, he'll slip up.
Look at this. Look at how this idiot packed it. He didn't tape it, he just flipped the flaps. (Kramer, Morty and Jerry are looking around grabbing raincoats which are scattered all over the place.) Kramer you missed a couple.
Its nothing. I got it. So, how are your levels coming along?
Well one day somebody's going to sleep on that thing and we'll get sued. I hope this doctor knows what he's doing.
You don't understand, you gotta have a buffer zone.
Ahh! Ahh! So YOU got the scotch tape! I've been looking all over for it!
I say the guy was painting without his glasses.
Tell your parents we said 'Hi!' (They leave)
Hey! I do you like this? Huh, huh!
It doesn't make a difference. They think we're in cahoots.
He doesnt want to ask Elaine for the number.
(searching in a kitchen drawer) What happened to the scotch tape? Who takes the scotch tape? Nobody returns anything around here.
(from outside the door; singing) I could have danced all night (entering with Helen) I could have danced all night and still have
HaAhhh! The Velcro. I can't stand Velcro. It's that t-e-a-r-I-n-g sound. I used to be in raincoats. I refused to put that in any of my lines.
I am not interested in his diagnosis. He's a bum.
(loud) Tell them when you took my son's pen back. Tell them about that! (he gets up)
This is my son Jerry, from New York. (leaning toward Sid) He thinks he can lift more than Izzy.
Believe me, I wouldnt bother you if the army hadnt closed that base in Sarasota. Here, scribble a little something here.
Alright. Next thing on the agenda, the restoration of the fence at the Briarwood gate. At the present time, we are still accepting bids.
(shocked) A thousand?! I know a coupla Chinamen over there on Forty-third Street, who'll do it for half that.
Maybe a couple of muscle relaxers would help.
That's the second time you said "personal favor". Why do you keep saying that?
You see, he had the right idea. Hold out. That's how you get the big money, huh George? (slaps George on the shoulder)
(to the crowd) He gave my son a pen, and then he takes it back. Tell them about that!
(coming into the hall) This is the home stretch. Tomorrow's the election!
I got a guarantee on that watch. Give it to me, I'll take it back to where we got it.
I'll tell you how crazy I am, I'm gonna pay for this whole trip with these coats.
He never even called Ed Roydlick. They were looking for someone!
Oh my God! She's gotta make a big deal out of everything.
Well, maybe you better make a pot of tea, too.
Yeah. They give you a tenderloin, a salad and a baked potato, for four-ninety-five. You know what that cost you after six?
I sure did. Raincoats were my business. The Executive was a classic, these haven't been made in twenty years.
You know what this means, dont you? We lost the Supersaver. Those tickets are non-refundable.
That's what the city's turning into. They'll steal anything.
My son bought me the car. It's a present.
Six hundred and sixty-three dollars and forty-five cents. And that's figuring conservatively at five percent interest, over fifty-three years, compounded quarterly. Or, if you put it into a ten-year T-bill...
So why dont you ask someone who was at the party?
No-one's ever been impeached before. I couldn't live here. We'd have to move to Boca.
(oblivious to the above) Two exact same watches. He tells you a week, and him a day. How could that be? Something's fishy about this.
Nothing. Batteries. (Jerry scoffs) Well, they wear out so quick.
They're not kicking me out. You don't have the votes.
Barefoot in the clubhouse? Don't you realize this is against the rules.
I came home one night, and I tripped over one of Jerry's toys. (Jerry smiling points to himself and nods with cards in his hands) So I took out my belt just to threaten him, and I got a glimpse of myself in the mirror.
(determined) Well, he's not getting away with this!
What're you talking about? You had a cheque bounce at the bodega.
Cheap fabric, and dim lighting. That's how you move merchandise.
( from the other room) Hey!!! They got a phone in the john here.
Look, I don't want anything to go wrong. If this woman votes to impeach me, I'll be a laughing stock.
I'm not interested in the X-Rays. I want my money back. Somebody stole my wallet. I had $225 in there.
Don't you think he had to be uh near sighted? I mean know body would paint like that if they could see. It's all out of focus.
Because of his moths you're not buying my raincoats?
Aw, Jerry. I should be buyin' you presents.
(opening his tracksuit top) See what I'm wearing?
Anyway there are these three big boxes, you can't miss them. I want you to ship them here to New York for me.
Yeah, looks like you're getting a little spare tire there, tiger.
No, we just came for the funeral. `
I'm sorry, we can't go back to Florida.
I dont know her either. (gesturing to Helen) She makes me fly all the way from Florida for this, and then she criticizes my jacket.
Hey! You know what these cost, they're like 80 cents a nut.
How the hell am I gonna pay for this?
Hey, these are very comfortable pants. You know what I paid for these Jerry?
No, no, he won't let me do that.
Now Jerry please, do not do this to your father. Over my dead body Jerry. I'll tell you right now, you're not going to do it.
Oh, you don't see. You don't see. Well it happened. Believe me.
Look, I got a few good years left. If I want a Chip Ahoy, I'm having it.
You don't understand. I can't allow my son to pay for me. Look, as soon as I get back to Florida, I promise you I'll mail you a check.
Oh, that one. She's been a member of the board longer than anybody. She's very tough to deal with.
You don't say? You know I have boxes of those sitting in my garage in Florida?
Alright alright, goodbye. (Morty hangs up the phone, Jack hangs up the phone) I don't think we are gonna make that flight.
Just a second. (Goes to grab the phone)
Oh, yeah, I'll be lying on an X-Ray table with my wallet in my mouth.
Well you don't have to retract it because we never went.
You don't understand, I've come this far, I can't stop now.
(looking around) This is some office. What's the square footage?
I'll call Jack Klompus, he's got a key to the garage. He can send them overnight delivery.
Say those are some nice pants. I got a pair just like them at home.
Would you excuse me please, we're conducting business here.
Jerry, this is Del Boca Vista's new physical fitness room. They got medicine balls, you can bike ride, anything you want.
So, I can use it in the restaurant to figure out the tip?
Look at this! Look at this! (excited) You bought a Cadillac?!
Jerry, what time do we have to be at the the Tonight Show on Thursday.
Jerry, I wanna tell you that meal was the worst.
Oh! Oh! That feels good. Hey! This guy charges a hundred bucks an hour but I'm telling ya he's worth every penny OOOOHH!
Izzy used to work out with Charles Atlas in the fifties.
My son never stole anything. He's a good boy.
Stay on 95 South to Biscayne Boulevard. Then you make a left turn. Put you blinker on immediatly, there's an abutment there. Then you're gonna merge over very quickly, but stay on Biscayne. Don't get off Biscayne. You understand me?
How would you feel if we sold the Cadillac?
I'm still going to Paris. I got a big deal cooking here.
That's right. My son bought it for me.
Aw! Aw! Oh my back! Oh my back! It's that bar. Who the hell could sleep on that thing?
Where do you come off with this crap?
