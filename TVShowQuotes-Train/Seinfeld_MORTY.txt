Who's off the street? I'm in the raincoat business for thirty-five years.
(determined) Well, he's not getting away with this!
Jack Klompus gave us six grand.
Daily what?
What?
So look.
So, howd you do?
I'll tell you what I'm looking at the next condo president of Del Boca Vista, Phase Three.
I knew it, I told you!
That didn't sound like the Golden Nugget.
Because if you are, you shouldn't. There's nothing available in that development.
Then who the hell said you couldn't have any? I mean what the hell do I care whether you have sponge cake?
Plum...(Jerry hangs up.)
I'd have to go back to work.
Why should I be comfortable?
We got plenty of time.
Boy, you are really something.
She's got priors.
Well, I sold raincoats in the garment centre for thirty-eight years. In nineteen forty-nine...
Tomorrow afternoon?
Look, I don't want anything to go wrong. If this woman votes to impeach me, I'll be a laughing stock.
What are you talking about? What was I supposed to hide it somewhere?
This is some building, Harry Fleming used to have an office here. There was a deli on the first floor. You don't get corned beef like that anymore. What happened to that deli?
You should be! How could you spend two hundred dollars on a tip calculator?!
Tell him to eat a plum.
Well, I, as your president, have to find the best price, and right now, I for one, do not think it's cost-feasible.
Why not?
What do you want?
Well, we just bought a new place down there.
(without looking up) Who are they?
How come he gets to leave?
What about the end, with the list?
No proof? We'll get him. He's a crook, sooner or later, he'll slip up.
You didn't have a deal?
Jerry, why didn't you get them Wizards?
Hello.
C'mon, take a ride.
Yes, I do!
Jack have some spong cake.
So why dont you ask someone who was at the party?
I retract your retraction.
Well, it's getting kinda late, why don't we uh...
Your mother doesn't like my taste in clothing.
Are you getting that?
Morty Seinfeld. I cut velvet for forty years with Harry Altman.
Yes, I'm sure. I went in to get my X-Ray, Somebody takes my wallet. Is that the operation here?
Nervous, Jack?
George is right. Those people will try to get away with murder. Believe me. They're all crooks.
You broke the window?
Hey, Mr. Kramer!
Hey, these are very comfortable pants. You know what I paid for these Jerry?
I don't think we even use it.
(surprised) President?
Hey, George!
No, your mother found it. Son, this is the most wonderful and thoughtful thing you've ever done for me.
Wrap it up, we'll take it home.
This is a huge scandal! We need damage control.
You stick up for that sofa like I'm criticizing a person.
I'll tell you how crazy I am, I'm gonna pay for this whole trip with these coats.
A present?
Whats wrong with it?
I sure did. Raincoats were my business. The Executive was a classic, these haven't been made in twenty years.
(dismissive) Ahh!
So, when do I get to see the doctor?
You're packing cereal?
Leo, I'm listening to Leo now!
Know body died. Jack I want you to do me a big favor. (Jerry holding up some cards looking at his father) In my garage there are a couple of boxes.
You what I'll do next time? I'll hide it so nobody can find it.
Barefoot in the clubhouse? Don't you realize this is against the rules.
Hey, Mr. Kramer. Ha ha ha.
Jerry, I wanna tell you that meal was the worst.
It's too much car, Jerry.
No, we just came for the funeral. `
Number One, signing off.
Astronaut!
I got a guarantee on that watch. Give it to me, I'll take it back to where we got it.
Outside? What's going on?
Yeah, yeah, you make money.
Come on. That's enough, sit down!
Jerry, what time do we have to be at the the Tonight Show on Thursday.
You don't understand. I can't allow my son to pay for me. Look, as soon as I get back to Florida, I promise you I'll mail you a check.
Why would he mind? We're his parents.
I wouldn't give him the satisfaction.
You know what my greatest moment was, dont you? Nineteen-forty-six. I went to work for Harry Flemming and I came up with the idea for the beltless trenchcoat.
I'll get a book.
Maybe a couple of muscle relaxers would help.
What? Im gonna buy a new sport jacket now?
Six hundred and sixty-three dollars and forty-five cents. And that's figuring conservatively at five percent interest, over fifty-three years, compounded quarterly. Or, if you put it into a ten-year T-bill...
(searching in a kitchen drawer) What happened to the scotch tape? Who takes the scotch tape? Nobody returns anything around here.
(to the crowd) He gave my son a pen, and then he takes it back. Tell them about that!
Just a second. (Goes to grab the phone)
This isn't a Wizard, it's a Willard.
Oh, it's George.
(looking around) This is some office. What's the square footage?
(noticing Kramer's coat) Look at that, Helen do you see what he's wearing? That's the Executive.
It's Morty
Don't worry about it.
Go to the building. She goes out to lunch, doesnt she?
D'you realise, an above-average performing growth mutual fund for fifty-three years...
You won't regret this, Miss Benes. What time should I be in? I get up at four, I could be here as early as four twenty-five.
Just watch me do my thing.
Maybe we can get an army transport flight. They got a base in Sarasota, I think.
(checking pants) They stole my wallet. The bum stole my wallet. (opens door, shouts into the hallway) MY WALLET'S GONE! MY WALLET'S GONE! I had my wallet in my back pocket. It's gone.
You wanna take a ride?
You said you didn't want it!
Good. O.K. (the photographer walks away) What about last year when I took him to the hospital every day? Did he ever say thank you?
This shirt will never leave my body.
I'm not talking loud!
Leo, let's go.
He gave him the pen.
Maybe I should talk to Elaine.
Twice! And Dembrow doesn't even know you. His son happens to live on your floor.
All right, all right.
That's right. They went like hotcakes.
I say the guy was painting without his glasses.
Ahh! Ahh! So YOU got the scotch tape! I've been looking all over for it!
So what, why is that worth twenty-five percent? It's a finders fee. You know what a finders fee is?
You don't understand my...
Always, Jerry. Always.
Say those are some nice pants. I got a pair just like them at home.
Just do it first thing tomorrow. I need it.
I haven't been able to reach him. Hey I'll call him right now.
Don't tell me about business! I sold raincoats for thirty-five years!
All this? This whole thing? It's going to take me forty-five minutes.
nan
When are we gonna tell Jerry?
Not really.
How about Loni Anderson?
We'll take a bus.
Could you believe that guy?
Congratulations, Mr. President.
That's a good idea.
Helen, we got into restaurants and figure out the tips.
I don't see envelopes!
The whole movie was in black and white.
If anything you're getting too much.
Finder's fee is ten percent and no more.
What?
Don't worry about it.
Well you're not getting thirty-five.
Did you have a coke or what?
You gotta jiggle it a little bit. I jiggled it. I jiggled it for fifteen minutes.
Nobody uses it.
So, what are you? Afraid of her?
And its always about Jeffrey, right?
That's what the city's turning into. They'll steal anything.
Maybe you should see a doctor.
This is it.
Hello.
Don't you think he had to be uh near sighted? I mean know body would paint like that if they could see. It's all out of focus.
Alright, are you ready to eat?
Hey, Jerry.
Hey! Look at this, a wallet. Exactly what I needed, y'see.
Oh, that one. She's been a member of the board longer than anybody. She's very tough to deal with.
I'm gonna explain what boxes.
No-one's ever been impeached before. I couldn't live here. We'd have to move to Boca.
Because the Costanzas are moving into Del Boca Vista.
My son bought me the car. It's a present.
From Maryland. The one who brought you the chocolate covered cherries you didnt like.
They'll be here first thing Thursday morning.
What was that?
Did you send them?
Oh, yeah, I'll be lying on an X-Ray table with my wallet in my mouth.
Welcome to Florida!
(to Helen) Slept on the job? (she shushed him)
They're not kicking me out. You don't have the votes.
(to Leo) I don't understand this jeweller, Jimmy Sherman. (indicates Jerry) He brings in a watch, it takes over a week to fix. He fixed yours in one day.
(cleaning his shoes) Good evening, Mr. Kramer!
But there are no stamps on these.
What leg work?
(skeptical) Thousands?!
Oh, well...
Jerry, this is Del Boca Vista's new physical fitness room. They got medicine balls, you can bike ride, anything you want.
Bring me the receipt.
He pretends he bumped into her!
Got lucky.
I'm still going to Paris. I got a big deal cooking here.
Ah, he's deaf anyway.
(standing) Okay. Tomorrow, Jerry and I will visit Izzy and apologise. Now, goodnight.
I'm sorry, we can't go back to Florida.
(on the phone) Hello Jack.
Hey! You know what these cost, they're like 80 cents a nut.
(to George as he is about to leave) Hey give 'em our best though.
Look at this. Look at how this idiot packed it. He didn't tape it, he just flipped the flaps. (Kramer, Morty and Jerry are looking around grabbing raincoats which are scattered all over the place.) Kramer you missed a couple.
Hello?
And every morning I eat a plum.
Hello Elaine
(Morty goes on louder! Did he ever whisper in any episode? -) Why do you need more friends? You've got plenty of friends.
Tell your parents we said 'Hi!' (They leave)
Well you don't have to retract it because we never went.
Ok it's a deal
Jerry, I'll tell ya. The first thing I'm gonna do when I get back to Florida is take a shower.
Bye bye. (hugging Jerry) Thanks again for the wallet.
Oh, for Gods sake!
(comes to the kitchen and with a loud voice) Why are you whispering?
Alright, let's get going.
You didn't give it to him.
This was a gift from my son.
That had nothing to do with it, the man was out of shape.
How would you feel if we sold the Cadillac?
Will you stop it Jerry. Let go.
Stealing?!
(walking back out of the room) Don't tell your mother.
Well, go up to the office.
(indicating) So, how d'you like this?
(standing) Okay, I'm done. I'll be back in the morning, when he's close to finish with his story.
Alright, Leo.
No no, the luggage is on the program. I got a brick in here.
Would you excuse me please, we're conducting business here.
Nothing. Batteries. (Jerry scoffs) Well, they wear out so quick.
Ya so have I
That's the second time you said "personal favor". Why do you keep saying that?
They stole my wallet.
( from the other room) Hey!!! They got a phone in the john here.
I dont know her either. (gesturing to Helen) She makes me fly all the way from Florida for this, and then she criticizes my jacket.
Ok, bye.
That's giving it away. This is a one of a kind item.
(unpanicked) There's already an ambulance here for Mrs Glickman. There's room for one more.
I'll sleep standing up. I'll be fine.
I wanted a Chip Ahoy.
What?
You're a terrific kid.
(depressed) You know what this funerals gonna wind up costing me? Oh boy!
Leave all my stuff here?
(Jerry comes out of his room, having just woken up) Rise and shine, sleepy head! Ha ha!
Yea
Alright. Next thing on the agenda, the restoration of the fence at the Briarwood gate. At the present time, we are still accepting bids.
(oblivious to the above) Two exact same watches. He tells you a week, and him a day. How could that be? Something's fishy about this.
Hey, Georgie-boy, how are ya?
We'll round down.
Yeah, so?
Bye, Mr. Kramer.
Look at this! Look at this! (excited) You bought a Cadillac?!
The Mandelbaums own the Magic Pan restaurants.
Well one day somebody's going to sleep on that thing and we'll get sued. I hope this doctor knows what he's doing.
Low flow? I don't like the sound of that.
What the hell are you looking for?
Here, I got it.
I'm very comfortable working outta the house. I have a phone, we have a Kinko's nearby. You know, I think that my resume speaks for itself.
Hey, thats some big job.
That's right. Have you ever heard of anything like that?
(to Jack, loud) That's what you say.
(unconcerned) Ach, I never knew what the hell I was peddling with those stupid cartoons and that paper book, anyway.
Who is it?
You know what this means, dont you? We lost the Supersaver. Those tickets are non-refundable.
We'll see.
Whats the matter? You need a lawyer?
We can't stand them.
You didn't get in?
The service was slow. And God forbid they should refill the water. How does 12.4% sound?
We saw Regis Philbin get out of a limousine.
I did so thank him!
Helen, will you stop bothering him.
(to Jerry) Can you believe this?!
Hiya Kramer.
Yeah.
Make sure Kramer uses good tape when he sends back the raincoats.
I told you to send them express.
Listen, is it all right if we move in with you for a little while? Sounds of breaking glass, Jerry dropped his bottle.
I want to know what kind of an office this is where you can't leave your pants in the room. You tell me.
(Morty gets up) Oh! I forgot all about it.
Maybe some people don't like him. I could see that.
What are you talking? We use it.
What are you worried about?
Stop it.
Hey! Under Siege is on again. Whose up for it?
My son never stole anything. He's a good boy.
I'll make a few phone calls.
Now Jerry please, do not do this to your father. Over my dead body Jerry. I'll tell you right now, you're not going to do it.
Uh we'll drive around for a while.
I keep telling her it's like an oven in here.
Who's that?
What?
(laughs) Heh hah!
I'm sorry Leo's moving back here. I'm not ready to go back to Florida.
How could you not get the insurance?
Jerry, you ever watch that?
(eating lunch with Helen and Jerry) Another fine meal, and now for my Wizard tip calculator.
(getting up from the table and coming over) Why is that?
Hey! I do you like this? Huh, huh!
What was that?
You dont understand, Ive never paid a full fare.
What are you kidding me?
No, no, he won't let me do that.
Hey guys . Jerry . Kramer
What are you talking about?
Sorbonne? Oh, hey. (To Helen) That's in Paris.
Yeah. They give you a tenderloin, a salad and a baked potato, for four-ninety-five. You know what that cost you after six?
(to the chiro) Who are you?
It's mine.
How the hell do you work this thing?
Jack can afford to give away a pen with all his money. Believe me. He gives me a check for 19.45. He didn't have a Coke. Ho, ho, ho!
Its nothing. I got it. So, how are your levels coming along?
Attaboy! Helen, Jerry got me a hot Wizard computer!
Those are my coats. I saved them, I stored them, I've been waiting years for this pay off.
(holding Jerry's shoulders) Jerry lives in New York. You just came from New York, didn't you?
Don't worry. I'll get to the other functions. (trying to open it) I can't get it open.
Look at this. It's a book. Employer's address. Whydo they need this? You know I never had a back problem until that night I slept on the convertible sofa. (hu hu) My back was fine.
Anyway there are these three big boxes, you can't miss them. I want you to ship them here to New York for me.
Nice to see you, Mrs Choate.
Raincoats.
Jerry's a comedian.
Do you know what the interest on that fifty dollars comes to over fifty-three years?
You just heard about this today?
Maybe he doesn't like Ted Danson.
Call an ambulance.
Hello
Oh my God! She's gotta make a big deal out of everything.
(from outside the door; singing) I could have danced all night (entering with Helen) I could have danced all night and still have
Izzy used to work out with Charles Atlas in the fifties.
(rushing to his bedroom) First, I need a nap.
All right, all right, Let's go already. They keep you in here a year. They don't give a damn. I could die in here. . . .(open the door and shouts into the hallway) Excuse me! Excuse me! What's going on? I'm here twenty minutes. Could somebody please help me.
Hello Elaine
Jerry have you ever seen any of those impressionist paintings?
We're going with a select charter group.
Aah! (Jack leaves) The nerve of that guy! Taking back that pen. Well that's it for them.
You ever see one so nice?
Well, maybe you better make a pot of tea, too.
That's right. My son bought it for me.
Yeah, looks like you're getting a little spare tire there, tiger.
What are you talking? Jeffrey works for the parks department!
because she puts up such a big stink every time I have a piece of meat.
You don't even think about it, there's so much going on.
I'm ready
Hey Jerry, look at this. My seat's got a memory, in case somebody moves it. I could be in prison for five years. I come out, my seat goes right back to where I like it.
You know what the flight backll cost us?
Yeah, while I was in getting X-Rayed.
Are you kidding? They built the lake.
Hello Rachel.
What the hell is going on here?
You gotta deal.
Yknow Jerry, its a good thing I wasnt so particular.
Alright alright, goodbye. (Morty hangs up the phone, Jack hangs up the phone) I don't think we are gonna make that flight.
No, no put it away . . .
Pinko Commie rag.
I was never impeached! I resigned!
It doesn't make a difference. They think we're in cahoots.
Twenty minutes. I've been waiting twenty minutes.
(coming into the hall) This is the home stretch. Tomorrow's the election!
What are you talking about? I'm the one who should have called the police. They stole my wallet.
You believe this?
I came home one night, and I tripped over one of Jerry's toys. (Jerry smiling points to himself and nods with cards in his hands) So I took out my belt just to threaten him, and I got a glimpse of myself in the mirror.
Uh huh.
Aw! Aw! Oh my back! Oh my back! It's that bar. Who the hell could sleep on that thing?
I don't want it!
Yeah. This is all big crepe money.
Ah, good-bye.
(still loud) What about her?
They should have put that show on 5 years ago. Bunch of idiots at that network. Can I tell you something, Jerry? It's all crap on TV. The only thing I watch is Xena the Warrior Princess. She must be about six-six.
Depends on the firm.
Don't lie Jerry.
(to Helen) You don't want it? Are you kidding?
Why the hell didn't you tell us?
I told her you'd get married. She thought you'd never do it.
What're you talking about? You had a cheque bounce at the bodega.
So what did you do about the window?
What do you mean?
(opening his tracksuit top) See what I'm wearing?
This looks like too much money.
Who needs this?
Hello. Hello, Mrs Choate.
That's terrific!
How the hell am I gonna pay for this?
What nervous?
So, I can use it in the restaurant to figure out the tip?
All right. Make it 20 bucks.
Helen, did you pack my travel gym?
So much the better.
Cheap fabric, and dim lighting. That's how you move merchandise.
What're you doing? Are you making coffee?
You sell clothes here, don't you?
They give you that *Fish.*
He's not gonna return the pen. That's ridiculous.
Jack is emceeing tomorrow. He's in charge of the whole thing.
I wanna tell you. This is one of the most thoughtful gifts anyone's ever given me.
What kind of clip joint are ya running here?
There are twenty people on the board. Thank God you can get that deal.
What's the difference, we'll figure something out.
What are you, nuts?
You see, he had the right idea. Hold out. That's how you get the big money, huh George? (slaps George on the shoulder)
Hello Jack.
Aw, Jerry. I should be buyin' you presents.
Youve got your degree. They dont care. They just want to see something.
And smart! Like a computer!
You what? You bought me a Cadillac?
Only twenty-five minutes a day, and you can attach it to any doorknob.
See that? You couldn't do that.
Oh! Oh! That feels good. Hey! This guy charges a hundred bucks an hour but I'm telling ya he's worth every penny OOOOHH!
If they get the votes.
No, no, no. He knows how to talk to these people. No-one's gonna take advantage of Georgie. (slaps George's shoulder again)
Hello, Jerry? It's your father.
Alright Jer.
Quones not a word.
Oh come on!
So, what took you so long?
I don't have it. I'll mail you one.
All right, Leo.
Oooh! Heh heh! It's a radar detector.
Boy that was some show.
He's wearing one.
First Leo breaks up, then he goes back. What the hell's going on?
(to Jerry) You remember Jack and Doris?
(shocked) A thousand?! I know a coupla Chinamen over there on Forty-third Street, who'll do it for half that.
Hey! This is the kind of room Sinatra stays in. Hey! look , Macadamian nuts.
He never even called Ed Roydlick. They were looking for someone!
Oh my God! What the hell happened to you?
Hi, Morty Seinfeld. I have a two o'clock appointment.
I tell you, he bought it for me!
You shoulda told me it didn't work.
Because I have the votes.
(shout) Jerry!
He doesnt want to ask Elaine for the number.
Jerry, don't go.
He thought he could buy back that Cadillac for us? He's not getting away with that.
By the time we sit down, it'll be quarter to five.
This is my son Jerry, from New York. (leaning toward Sid) He thinks he can lift more than Izzy.
They're good around the house -- and they're good for outside.
Take it easy, I've been through a million of these negotiations.
You know that number?
Get out of here.
Aha!
So, you stand in the lobby, by the elevator, and wait for her to come down for lunch.
So that night I cut off the loops and the Executive was born.
Plus the insurance.
Somebody had a coke.
yeah, he's supposed to be the emcee.
Because we had a buyer, and we couldn't get a free flight until now.
Ok, let's go.
Helen, did you know that they tape this thing in the afternoon?
What did you have? You had the minute steak?
I dont know how youre going to be comfortable like that.
What's not to understand?
My son bought me that car!
HaAhhh! The Velcro. I can't stand Velcro. It's that t-e-a-r-I-n-g sound. I used to be in raincoats. I refused to put that in any of my lines.
That's right, they're my coats.
But it comes on 1130.
(trying to press the cheque on Jerry) And we want you to have the money.
Should I pick up?
You know Jack, you've got a hell of a nerve taking that kid's pen.
Ill get it!
My idiot son could open that garage door.
Well what's the difference we'll go some place else.
Hey, I agree with him. Nobody likes a kid with a pony.
Bye, Jer.
What'ya got leather seats here?
You're out of your mind.
So ask Elaine there for her number.
Well, if he fixes my back I'll be happy. . . . (back to the form) Have you ever had a sexually transmitted disease? That's IT! . . . Here, you got my name, you got my address. That's enough.
What the hell are you doing here?
Why, whats wrong with Loni Anderson?
You gotta pull on the knob as you turn it.
You don't say? You know I have boxes of those sitting in my garage in Florida?
I'm not interested in the X-Rays. I want my money back. Somebody stole my wallet. I had $225 in there.
(indicates the new wallet) It's velcro.
You send me the bill.
I got my sport jacket.
19.45$ ?
Ah, there he is!
Well, she cant be too mad. Shes still coming to the wedding.
Who's Mr Fancy?
