Yeah. This is all big crepe money.
What's the difference, we'll figure something out.
He pretends he bumped into her!
Yknow Jerry, its a good thing I wasnt so particular.
She's got priors.
There she is.
Ya so have I
All right, all right.
He'll send them express.
Oh my God! She's gotta make a big deal out of everything.
No no, the luggage is on the program. I got a brick in here.
You gotta deal.
You didn't have a deal?
This shirt will never leave my body.
(cleaning his shoes) Good evening, Mr. Kramer!
Well, I, as your president, have to find the best price, and right now, I for one, do not think it's cost-feasible.
I told her you'd get married. She thought you'd never do it.
Here, I got it.
How come he gets to leave?
Jerry, what time do we have to be at the the Tonight Show on Thursday.
Plum...(Jerry hangs up.)
Good. O.K. (the photographer walks away) What about last year when I took him to the hospital every day? Did he ever say thank you?
What's not to understand?
I came home one night, and I tripped over one of Jerry's toys. (Jerry smiling points to himself and nods with cards in his hands) So I took out my belt just to threaten him, and I got a glimpse of myself in the mirror.
Bring me the receipt.
Call an ambulance.
You know what my greatest moment was, dont you? Nineteen-forty-six. I went to work for Harry Flemming and I came up with the idea for the beltless trenchcoat.
Alright, let's get going.
Helen, will you stop bothering him.
(from outside the door; singing) I could have danced all night (entering with Helen) I could have danced all night and still have
(to Jack, loud) That's what you say.
If they get the votes.
I say the guy was painting without his glasses.
You know Jack, you've got a hell of a nerve taking that kid's pen.
(standing) Okay, I'm done. I'll be back in the morning, when he's close to finish with his story.
They're good around the house -- and they're good for outside.
Nothing nothing.
Bye, Mr. Kramer.
You shoulda told me it didn't work.
Jerry, this is Del Boca Vista's new physical fitness room. They got medicine balls, you can bike ride, anything you want.
What leg work?
Oh, for Gods sake!
The Mandelbaums own the Magic Pan restaurants.
I'm still going to Paris. I got a big deal cooking here.
I want to know what kind of an office this is where you can't leave your pants in the room. You tell me.
Hey, George!
What?
So, what are you? Afraid of her?
Ahh! Ahh! So YOU got the scotch tape! I've been looking all over for it!
My son never stole anything. He's a good boy.
I wanna tell you. This is one of the most thoughtful gifts anyone's ever given me.
Its nothing. I got it. So, how are your levels coming along?
You gotta pull on the knob as you turn it.
How would you feel if we sold the Cadillac?
Yes, I'm sure. I went in to get my X-Ray, Somebody takes my wallet. Is that the operation here?
Oh my God! What the hell happened to you?
Hey guys . Jerry . Kramer
Then who the hell said you couldn't have any? I mean what the hell do I care whether you have sponge cake?
No proof? We'll get him. He's a crook, sooner or later, he'll slip up.
Hey! Look at this, a wallet. Exactly what I needed, y'see.
Anyway there are these three big boxes, you can't miss them. I want you to ship them here to New York for me.
I'll make a few phone calls.
You gotta jiggle it a little bit. I jiggled it. I jiggled it for fifteen minutes.
Ah, good-bye.
This looks like too much money.
Six hundred and sixty-three dollars and forty-five cents. And that's figuring conservatively at five percent interest, over fifty-three years, compounded quarterly. Or, if you put it into a ten-year T-bill...
C'mon, take a ride.
(to Leo) I don't understand this jeweller, Jimmy Sherman. (indicates Jerry) He brings in a watch, it takes over a week to fix. He fixed yours in one day.
Attaboy! Helen, Jerry got me a hot Wizard computer!
Are you kidding? They built the lake.
Maybe we can get an army transport flight. They got a base in Sarasota, I think.
I thought you forgot about me.
Izzy used to work out with Charles Atlas in the fifties.
Yeah, yeah, you make money.
Hello. Hello, Mrs Choate.
They stole my wallet.
So look.
Hey, thats some big job.
So what did you do about the window?
This isn't a Wizard, it's a Willard.
Leo, let's go.
You what? You bought me a Cadillac?
Well you don't have to retract it because we never went.
Buh bye Elaine
I'm ready
Because we had a buyer, and we couldn't get a free flight until now.
( from the other room) Hey!!! They got a phone in the john here.
What do you want?
Leo, I'm listening to Leo now!
So what, why is that worth twenty-five percent? It's a finders fee. You know what a finders fee is?
You know I've been thinking, why is Kramer getting twenty-five percent?
First Leo breaks up, then he goes back. What the hell's going on?
(unconcerned) Ach, I never knew what the hell I was peddling with those stupid cartoons and that paper book, anyway.
Hoh, here he is. This is the man I wanted you to see. Izzy Mandelbaum. He's eighty years old, but strong as an ox. (pointing) Watch this.
That's the second time you said "personal favor". Why do you keep saying that?
Aah! (Jack leaves) The nerve of that guy! Taking back that pen. Well that's it for them.
Hello Elaine
Maybe you should see a doctor.
Why should I be comfortable?
Know body died. Jack I want you to do me a big favor. (Jerry holding up some cards looking at his father) In my garage there are a couple of boxes.
(to Helen) You don't want it? Are you kidding?
Well one day somebody's going to sleep on that thing and we'll get sued. I hope this doctor knows what he's doing.
That's right, they're my coats.
(holding Jerry's shoulders) Jerry lives in New York. You just came from New York, didn't you?
What the hell are you looking for?
Hey, Georgie-boy, how are ya?
So bring a snack-pack.
How long they been doing this?
(standing) Okay. Tomorrow, Jerry and I will visit Izzy and apologise. Now, goodnight.
Pinko Commie rag.
You know that number?
My son bought me the car. It's a present.
This is a huge scandal! We need damage control.
Send them tomorrow.
Jerry, you ever watch that?
You believe this?
Oh, that one. She's been a member of the board longer than anybody. She's very tough to deal with.
No, no, he won't let me do that.
My son bought me that car!
(surprised) President?
Ok it's a deal
Well, maybe you better make a pot of tea, too.
You don't understand, you gotta have a buffer zone.
(dismissive) Ahh!
All this? This whole thing? It's going to take me forty-five minutes.
Ok, bye.
Alright, Leo.
You don't understand fashion is cyclical this thing could come back.
Oh! Oh! That feels good. Hey! This guy charges a hundred bucks an hour but I'm telling ya he's worth every penny OOOOHH!
What are you kidding me?
What was that?
Believe me, I wouldnt bother you if the army hadnt closed that base in Sarasota. Here, scribble a little something here.
I'm paying.
yeah, he's supposed to be the emcee.
Who needs this?
Hey! This is the kind of room Sinatra stays in. Hey! look , Macadamian nuts.
Got lucky.
They should have put that show on 5 years ago. Bunch of idiots at that network. Can I tell you something, Jerry? It's all crap on TV. The only thing I watch is Xena the Warrior Princess. She must be about six-six.
George is right. Those people will try to get away with murder. Believe me. They're all crooks.
My idiot son could open that garage door.
Jerry have you ever seen any of those impressionist paintings?
That's giving it away. This is a one of a kind item.
Nobody uses it.
They'll be here first thing Thursday morning.
Because the Costanzas are moving into Del Boca Vista.
No-one's ever been impeached before. I couldn't live here. We'd have to move to Boca.
Doesnt sound like youre friends to me. If you were friends you'd-youd ask her for the number. Do you know where this other one works?
You sell clothes here, don't you?
Bye, Jer.
"My Fair Lady"
You don't say? You know I have boxes of those sitting in my garage in Florida?
What are you worried about?
(simultaneous) Hey!/That's wonderful!/We got a deal!
Will you stop it Jerry. Let go.
Why not?
I'm very comfortable working outta the house. I have a phone, we have a Kinko's nearby. You know, I think that my resume speaks for itself.
D'you realise, an above-average performing growth mutual fund for fifty-three years...
So, what took you so long?
You know what this means, dont you? We lost the Supersaver. Those tickets are non-refundable.
I haven't been able to reach him. Hey I'll call him right now.
You're a terrific kid.
Oh, well...
(to the chiro) Who are you?
(still loud) What about her?
All right, all right, Let's go already. They keep you in here a year. They don't give a damn. I could die in here. . . .(open the door and shouts into the hallway) Excuse me! Excuse me! What's going on? I'm here twenty minutes. Could somebody please help me.
Jack can afford to give away a pen with all his money. Believe me. He gives me a check for 19.45. He didn't have a Coke. Ho, ho, ho!
(rushing to his bedroom) First, I need a nap.
You think it's hot?
It's Morty
Helen, did you pack my travel gym?
That's right. My son bought it for me.
Welcome to Florida!
What are you talking about?
I retract your retraction.
I don't think we even use it.
Stealing?!
Twenty minutes. I've been waiting twenty minutes.
Hello Rachel.
Just a second. (Goes to grab the phone)
(to Helen) Slept on the job? (she shushed him)
Hi, Morty Seinfeld. I have a two o'clock appointment.
Stop it.
HaAhhh! The Velcro. I can't stand Velcro. It's that t-e-a-r-I-n-g sound. I used to be in raincoats. I refused to put that in any of my lines.
I'm sorry, we can't go back to Florida.
Maybe a couple of muscle relaxers would help.
What about the end, with the list?
That's right. Have you ever heard of anything like that?
His pen.
Look at this. It's a book. Employer's address. Whydo they need this? You know I never had a back problem until that night I slept on the convertible sofa. (hu hu) My back was fine.
We can't stand them.
I keep telling her it's like an oven in here.
No, we just came for the funeral. `
What?
Hey Jerry, look at this. My seat's got a memory, in case somebody moves it. I could be in prison for five years. I come out, my seat goes right back to where I like it.
Number One, signing off.
Not really.
So, I can use it in the restaurant to figure out the tip?
Look at this! Look at this! (excited) You bought a Cadillac?!
It's mine.
I'm sorry Leo's moving back here. I'm not ready to go back to Florida.
Oh come on!
What're you talking about?
Jerry, why didn't you get them Wizards?
Come on. That's enough, sit down!
You don't understand. I can't allow my son to pay for me. Look, as soon as I get back to Florida, I promise you I'll mail you a check.
Yeah. They give you a tenderloin, a salad and a baked potato, for four-ninety-five. You know what that cost you after six?
This is some building, Harry Fleming used to have an office here. There was a deli on the first floor. You don't get corned beef like that anymore. What happened to that deli?
Daily what?
That's terrific!
I'll call Jack Klompus, he's got a key to the garage. He can send them overnight delivery.
What kind of clip joint are ya running here?
He's wearing one.
A present?
Should I pick up?
So why dont you ask someone who was at the party?
We got plenty of time.
This was a gift from my son.
He never even called Ed Roydlick. They were looking for someone!
How could you not get the insurance?
I did so thank him!
I don't want it!
They're not kicking me out. You don't have the votes.
And its always about Jeffrey, right?
19.45$ ?
Hello Elaine
Depends on the firm.
You're out of your mind.
Jack Klompus gave us six grand.
Whats wrong with it?
What do you mean?
I'm not talking loud!
What? Im gonna buy a new sport jacket now?
I dont know her either. (gesturing to Helen) She makes me fly all the way from Florida for this, and then she criticizes my jacket.
He thought he could buy back that Cadillac for us? He's not getting away with that.
(to Jerry) You remember Jack and Doris?
Who's Mr Fancy?
Go to the building. She goes out to lunch, doesnt she?
Helen, did you know that they tape this thing in the afternoon?
You send me the bill.
How was I supposed to pay? I didn't have my wallet.
Aw, Jerry. I should be buyin' you presents.
(shocked) A thousand?! I know a coupla Chinamen over there on Forty-third Street, who'll do it for half that.
What for?
Youve got your degree. They dont care. They just want to see something.
All right, Leo.
(indicates the new wallet) It's velcro.
(shout) Jerry!
I'm thinking more like fifteen.
(checking pants) They stole my wallet. The bum stole my wallet. (opens door, shouts into the hallway) MY WALLET'S GONE! MY WALLET'S GONE! I had my wallet in my back pocket. It's gone.
Yeah, while I was in getting X-Rayed.
Why, whats wrong with Loni Anderson?
I'll sleep standing up. I'll be fine.
(to George as he is about to leave) Hey give 'em our best though.
Just do it first thing tomorrow. I need it.
Hello Jack.
You don't even think about it, there's so much going on.
Yes, I do!
(to the crowd) He gave my son a pen, and then he takes it back. Tell them about that!
Twice! And Dembrow doesn't even know you. His son happens to live on your floor.
Hello.
So, howd you do?
I knew it, I told you!
He gave him the pen.
Well we do.
The service was slow. And God forbid they should refill the water. How does 12.4% sound?
Look, I got a few good years left. If I want a Chip Ahoy, I'm having it.
You know what the flight backll cost us?
Tell your parents we said 'Hi!' (They leave)
Who's off the street? I'm in the raincoat business for thirty-five years.
You wanna take a ride?
Alright. Next thing on the agenda, the restoration of the fence at the Briarwood gate. At the present time, we are still accepting bids.
(getting up from the table and coming over) Why is that?
He doesnt want to ask Elaine for the number.
What'ya got leather seats here?
Listen, is it all right if we move in with you for a little while? Sounds of breaking glass, Jerry dropped his bottle.
Ok, let's go.
Would you excuse me please, we're conducting business here.
Do you know what the interest on that fifty dollars comes to over fifty-three years?
I'll tell you what I'm looking at the next condo president of Del Boca Vista, Phase Three.
Ah, he's deaf anyway.
That's a good idea.
You don't understand, I've come this far, I can't stop now.
What the hell is going on here?
You should be! How could you spend two hundred dollars on a tip calculator?!
What was that?
(looking around) This is some office. What's the square footage?
Yeah.
You said you didn't want it!
What are you talking about? What was I supposed to hide it somewhere?
It's too much car, Jerry.
Oooh! Heh heh! It's a radar detector.
No, no put it away . . .
Boy, you are really something.
Only twenty-five minutes a day, and you can attach it to any doorknob.
Jerry, don't go.
You ever see one so nice?
(walking back out of the room) Don't tell your mother.
(trying to press the cheque on Jerry) And we want you to have the money.
I don't see envelopes!
I wanted a Chip Ahoy.
I'll tell you how crazy I am, I'm gonna pay for this whole trip with these coats.
You broke the window?
We're keeping it.
(searching in a kitchen drawer) What happened to the scotch tape? Who takes the scotch tape? Nobody returns anything around here.
Alright alright, goodbye. (Morty hangs up the phone, Jack hangs up the phone) I don't think we are gonna make that flight.
When are we gonna tell Jerry?
(coming into the hall) This is the home stretch. Tomorrow's the election!
See that? You couldn't do that.
(oblivious to the above) Two exact same watches. He tells you a week, and him a day. How could that be? Something's fishy about this.
But there are no stamps on these.
So, you stand in the lobby, by the elevator, and wait for her to come down for lunch.
Your mother doesn't like my taste in clothing.
(laughs) Heh hah!
Nervous, Jack?
Well, we just bought a new place down there.
Jerry's a comedian.
Well, go up to the office.
Where do you come off with this crap?
(without looking up) Who are they?
Hey, Mr. Kramer!
What?
You didn't give it to him.
Because I have the votes.
Wrap it up, we'll take it home.
(determined) Well, he's not getting away with this!
Tomorrow afternoon?
Somebody had a coke.
You don't think it's fair.
Why the hell didn't you tell us?
Raincoats.
How the hell do you work this thing?
Did you send them?
What?
That didn't sound like the Golden Nugget.
Those are my coats. I saved them, I stored them, I've been waiting years for this pay off.
You don't understand my...
Maybe some people don't like him. I could see that.
Look at this. Look at how this idiot packed it. He didn't tape it, he just flipped the flaps. (Kramer, Morty and Jerry are looking around grabbing raincoats which are scattered all over the place.) Kramer you missed a couple.
Who's that?
Helen, we got into restaurants and figure out the tips.
You what I'll do next time? I'll hide it so nobody can find it.
Why would he mind? We're his parents.
That had nothing to do with it, the man was out of shape.
Yeah, looks like you're getting a little spare tire there, tiger.
Quones not a word.
Congratulations, Mr. President.
Yea
Well then what do they make appointments for if they can't keep them. Huh, hha. Look if I did that in my business I wouldn't have made a nickel.
We saw Regis Philbin get out of a limousine.
Ah, there he is!
Don't lie Jerry.
Outside? What's going on?
(unpanicked) There's already an ambulance here for Mrs Glickman. There's room for one more.
By the time we sit down, it'll be quarter to five.
Besides, it's not stealing if it's something you need.
You dont understand, Ive never paid a full fare.
How the hell am I gonna pay for this?
Oh, you don't see. You don't see. Well it happened. Believe me.
Uh we'll drive around for a while.
Low flow? I don't like the sound of that.
Hey Jerry. Number One here. Did you go see Izzy at the back specialist?
I don't have it. I'll mail you one.
Don't worry. I'll get to the other functions. (trying to open it) I can't get it open.
Who is it?
What the hell are you doing here?
I dont know how youre going to be comfortable like that.
Jerry, I'll tell ya. The first thing I'm gonna do when I get back to Florida is take a shower.
You know Jack, do me a favor will you? Take the pen and the scotch tape, and get the hell out of here!
Hello
This is my son Jerry, from New York. (leaning toward Sid) He thinks he can lift more than Izzy.
Finder's fee is ten percent and no more.
(eating lunch with Helen and Jerry) Another fine meal, and now for my Wizard tip calculator.
Are you ready for dessert?
(noticing Kramer's coat) Look at that, Helen do you see what he's wearing? That's the Executive.
Aha!
(skeptical) Thousands?!
(comes to the kitchen and with a loud voice) Why are you whispering?
You're packing cereal?
Nice to see you, Mrs Choate.
(indicating) So, how d'you like this?
Morty Seinfeld. I cut velvet for forty years with Harry Altman.
Hello, Jerry? It's your father.
What are you talking about? I'm the one who should have called the police. They stole my wallet.
Hello.
Make sure Kramer uses good tape when he sends back the raincoats.
Ill get it!
Are you getting that?
Well, it's getting kinda late, why don't we uh...
If anything you're getting too much.
Hey! You know what these cost, they're like 80 cents a nut.
(Jerry comes out of his room, having just woken up) Rise and shine, sleepy head! Ha ha!
(opening his tracksuit top) See what I'm wearing?
What nervous?
And smart! Like a computer!
Oh, yeah, I'll be lying on an X-Ray table with my wallet in my mouth.
That's what the city's turning into. They'll steal anything.
We'll take a bus.
Oh, yeah. I forgot all about it.
What did you have? You had the minute steak?
Boy that was some show.
Jerry!
You didn't get in?
(loud) Tell them when you took my son's pen back. Tell them about that! (he gets up)
Did you have a coke or what?
Jack is emceeing tomorrow. He's in charge of the whole thing.
Just watch me do my thing.
No, no, no. He knows how to talk to these people. No-one's gonna take advantage of Georgie. (slaps George's shoulder again)
Well, if he fixes my back I'll be happy. . . . (back to the form) Have you ever had a sexually transmitted disease? That's IT! . . . Here, you got my name, you got my address. That's enough.
Hey! Leo, get this, four movies at once; Pay Per View.
Maybe I should talk to Elaine.
Barefoot in the clubhouse? Don't you realize this is against the rules.
I wouldn't give him the satisfaction.
I got a guarantee on that watch. Give it to me, I'll take it back to where we got it.
There are twenty people on the board. Thank God you can get that deal.
Well you're not getting thirty-five.
Nothing. Batteries. (Jerry scoffs) Well, they wear out so quick.
nan
I'd have to go back to work.
Hiya Kramer.
Yeah, so?
We're going with a select charter group.
From Maryland. The one who brought you the chocolate covered cherries you didnt like.
Leave all my stuff here?
The whole movie was in black and white.
Whats the matter? You need a lawyer?
You see, he had the right idea. Hold out. That's how you get the big money, huh George? (slaps George on the shoulder)
I told you to send them express.
(depressed) You know what this funerals gonna wind up costing me? Oh boy!
So ask Elaine there for her number.
Hey, Mr. Kramer. Ha ha ha.
What're you talking about? You had a cheque bounce at the bodega.
What's all that?
He could wash them.
Don't tell me about business! I sold raincoats for thirty-five years!
And every morning I eat a plum.
So, how did she find out?
Don't you think he had to be uh near sighted? I mean know body would paint like that if they could see. It's all out of focus.
I tell you, he bought it for me!
Hey! I do you like this? Huh, huh!
Because if you are, you shouldn't. There's nothing available in that development.
Take it easy, I've been through a million of these negotiations.
Hey, I agree with him. Nobody likes a kid with a pony.
Alright, are you ready to eat?
Get out of here.
You got enough here for a life sentence.
I am not interested in his diagnosis. He's a bum.
Don't worry about it.
(on the phone) Hello Jack.
Say those are some nice pants. I got a pair just like them at home.
Jerry, I wanna tell you that meal was the worst.
He's not gonna return the pen. That's ridiculous.
So that night I cut off the loops and the Executive was born.
I was never impeached! I resigned!
I'm gonna explain what boxes.
Hey! Under Siege is on again. Whose up for it?
Uh huh.
Don't worry about it.
Tell him to eat a plum.
Alright Jer.
But it comes on 1130.
