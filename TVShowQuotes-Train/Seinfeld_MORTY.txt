(shocked) A thousand?! I know a coupla Chinamen over there on Forty-third Street, who'll do it for half that.
Jerry, I wanna tell you that meal was the worst.
George is right. Those people will try to get away with murder. Believe me. They're all crooks.
Cheap fabric, and dim lighting. That's how you move merchandise.
Maybe a couple of muscle relaxers would help.
Look, I got a few good years left. If I want a Chip Ahoy, I'm having it.
Besides, it's not stealing if it's something you need.
Nothing. Batteries. (Jerry scoffs) Well, they wear out so quick.
The whole movie was in black and white.
Maybe we can get an army transport flight. They got a base in Sarasota, I think.
(trying to press the cheque on Jerry) And we want you to have the money.
So what did you do about the window?
Yeah. They give you a tenderloin, a salad and a baked potato, for four-ninety-five. You know what that cost you after six?
Aah! (Jack leaves) The nerve of that guy! Taking back that pen. Well that's it for them.
He's not gonna return the pen. That's ridiculous.
How was I supposed to pay? I didn't have my wallet.
Doesnt sound like youre friends to me. If you were friends you'd-youd ask her for the number. Do you know where this other one works?
I'm not interested in the X-Rays. I want my money back. Somebody stole my wallet. I had $225 in there.
Well, I, as your president, have to find the best price, and right now, I for one, do not think it's cost-feasible.
Hey, these are very comfortable pants. You know what I paid for these Jerry?
(from outside the door; singing) I could have danced all night (entering with Helen) I could have danced all night and still have
They should have put that show on 5 years ago. Bunch of idiots at that network. Can I tell you something, Jerry? It's all crap on TV. The only thing I watch is Xena the Warrior Princess. She must be about six-six.
This is my son Jerry, from New York. (leaning toward Sid) He thinks he can lift more than Izzy.
You should be! How could you spend two hundred dollars on a tip calculator?!
You gotta jiggle it a little bit. I jiggled it. I jiggled it for fifteen minutes.
My son never stole anything. He's a good boy.
Believe me, I wouldnt bother you if the army hadnt closed that base in Sarasota. Here, scribble a little something here.
Just do it first thing tomorrow. I need it.
Jack can afford to give away a pen with all his money. Believe me. He gives me a check for 19.45. He didn't have a Coke. Ho, ho, ho!
You don't say? You know I have boxes of those sitting in my garage in Florida?
Because of his moths you're not buying my raincoats?
You dont understand, Ive never paid a full fare.
By the time we sit down, it'll be quarter to five.
No, no, he won't let me do that.
(depressed) You know what this funerals gonna wind up costing me? Oh boy!
Because if you are, you shouldn't. There's nothing available in that development.
HaAhhh! The Velcro. I can't stand Velcro. It's that t-e-a-r-I-n-g sound. I used to be in raincoats. I refused to put that in any of my lines.
Helen, did you know that they tape this thing in the afternoon?
Hoh, here he is. This is the man I wanted you to see. Izzy Mandelbaum. He's eighty years old, but strong as an ox. (pointing) Watch this.
Oh, that one. She's been a member of the board longer than anybody. She's very tough to deal with.
He never even called Ed Roydlick. They were looking for someone!
(opening his tracksuit top) See what I'm wearing?
Anyway there are these three big boxes, you can't miss them. I want you to ship them here to New York for me.
(comes to the kitchen and with a loud voice) Why are you whispering?
Oh! Oh! That feels good. Hey! This guy charges a hundred bucks an hour but I'm telling ya he's worth every penny OOOOHH!
The service was slow. And God forbid they should refill the water. How does 12.4% sound?
Stay on 95 South to Biscayne Boulevard. Then you make a left turn. Put you blinker on immediatly, there's an abutment there. Then you're gonna merge over very quickly, but stay on Biscayne. Don't get off Biscayne. You understand me?
(standing) Okay, I'm done. I'll be back in the morning, when he's close to finish with his story.
I'm very comfortable working outta the house. I have a phone, we have a Kinko's nearby. You know, I think that my resume speaks for itself.
Yes, I'm sure. I went in to get my X-Ray, Somebody takes my wallet. Is that the operation here?
(searching in a kitchen drawer) What happened to the scotch tape? Who takes the scotch tape? Nobody returns anything around here.
He doesnt want to ask Elaine for the number.
You don't even think about it, there's so much going on.
Hi, Morty Seinfeld. I have a two o'clock appointment.
Know body died. Jack I want you to do me a big favor. (Jerry holding up some cards looking at his father) In my garage there are a couple of boxes.
Jerry, this is Del Boca Vista's new physical fitness room. They got medicine balls, you can bike ride, anything you want.
Then who the hell said you couldn't have any? I mean what the hell do I care whether you have sponge cake?
I'll tell you what I'm looking at the next condo president of Del Boca Vista, Phase Three.
This is some building, Harry Fleming used to have an office here. There was a deli on the first floor. You don't get corned beef like that anymore. What happened to that deli?
I haven't been able to reach him. Hey I'll call him right now.
Well then what do they make appointments for if they can't keep them. Huh, hha. Look if I did that in my business I wouldn't have made a nickel.
Oh, you don't see. You don't see. Well it happened. Believe me.
Its nothing. I got it. So, how are your levels coming along?
Go to the building. She goes out to lunch, doesnt she?
(walking back out of the room) Don't tell your mother.
That's giving it away. This is a one of a kind item.
(Morty goes on louder! Did he ever whisper in any episode? -) Why do you need more friends? You've got plenty of friends.
All this? This whole thing? It's going to take me forty-five minutes.
Now Jerry please, do not do this to your father. Over my dead body Jerry. I'll tell you right now, you're not going to do it.
Oh my God! What the hell happened to you?
He thought he could buy back that Cadillac for us? He's not getting away with that.
My son bought me the car. It's a present.
(to George as he is about to leave) Hey give 'em our best though.
So what, why is that worth twenty-five percent? It's a finders fee. You know what a finders fee is?
I don't have it. I'll mail you one.
Well, it's getting kinda late, why don't we uh...
Take it easy, I've been through a million of these negotiations.
(oblivious to the above) Two exact same watches. He tells you a week, and him a day. How could that be? Something's fishy about this.
I got a guarantee on that watch. Give it to me, I'll take it back to where we got it.
You know what my greatest moment was, dont you? Nineteen-forty-six. I went to work for Harry Flemming and I came up with the idea for the beltless trenchcoat.
(standing) Okay. Tomorrow, Jerry and I will visit Izzy and apologise. Now, goodnight.
(rushing to his bedroom) First, I need a nap.
Well, maybe you better make a pot of tea, too.
Sorbonne? Oh, hey. (To Helen) That's in Paris.
Well, we just bought a new place down there.
Look, I don't want anything to go wrong. If this woman votes to impeach me, I'll be a laughing stock.
Aw! Aw! Oh my back! Oh my back! It's that bar. Who the hell could sleep on that thing?
You won't regret this, Miss Benes. What time should I be in? I get up at four, I could be here as early as four twenty-five.
I wanna tell you. This is one of the most thoughtful gifts anyone's ever given me.
Because we had a buyer, and we couldn't get a free flight until now.
There are twenty people on the board. Thank God you can get that deal.
Maybe some people don't like him. I could see that.
(eating lunch with Helen and Jerry) Another fine meal, and now for my Wizard tip calculator.
They're good around the house -- and they're good for outside.
I'm still going to Paris. I got a big deal cooking here.
First Leo breaks up, then he goes back. What the hell's going on?
Hey Jerry. Number One here. Did you go see Izzy at the back specialist?
You know I've been thinking, why is Kramer getting twenty-five percent?
No, your mother found it. Son, this is the most wonderful and thoughtful thing you've ever done for me.
because she puts up such a big stink every time I have a piece of meat.
You gotta pull on the knob as you turn it.
Hey Jerry, look at this. My seat's got a memory, in case somebody moves it. I could be in prison for five years. I come out, my seat goes right back to where I like it.
No, we just came for the funeral. `
Morty Seinfeld. I cut velvet for forty years with Harry Altman.
Say those are some nice pants. I got a pair just like them at home.
I dont know her either. (gesturing to Helen) She makes me fly all the way from Florida for this, and then she criticizes my jacket.
What kind of clip joint are ya running here?
I came home one night, and I tripped over one of Jerry's toys. (Jerry smiling points to himself and nods with cards in his hands) So I took out my belt just to threaten him, and I got a glimpse of myself in the mirror.
(holding Jerry's shoulders) Jerry lives in New York. You just came from New York, didn't you?
That's the second time you said "personal favor". Why do you keep saying that?
Oh my God! She's gotta make a big deal out of everything.
No-one's ever been impeached before. I couldn't live here. We'd have to move to Boca.
( from the other room) Hey!!! They got a phone in the john here.
I'll call Jack Klompus, he's got a key to the garage. He can send them overnight delivery.
(unconcerned) Ach, I never knew what the hell I was peddling with those stupid cartoons and that paper book, anyway.
Don't you think he had to be uh near sighted? I mean know body would paint like that if they could see. It's all out of focus.
No, no put it away . . .
Hey! Look at this, a wallet. Exactly what I needed, y'see.
I told her you'd get married. She thought you'd never do it.
Your mother doesn't like my taste in clothing.
Well, if he fixes my back I'll be happy. . . . (back to the form) Have you ever had a sexually transmitted disease? That's IT! . . . Here, you got my name, you got my address. That's enough.
Look, if we're gonna stay here until all hours of the night, can we at least get some food here?
I tell you, he bought it for me!
(coming into the hall) This is the home stretch. Tomorrow's the election!
Hey! I do you like this? Huh, huh!
Low flow? I don't like the sound of that.
(getting up from the table and coming over) Why is that?
(noticing Kramer's coat) Look at that, Helen do you see what he's wearing? That's the Executive.
Look at this. It's a book. Employer's address. Whydo they need this? You know I never had a back problem until that night I slept on the convertible sofa. (hu hu) My back was fine.
I keep telling her it's like an oven in here.
(checking pants) They stole my wallet. The bum stole my wallet. (opens door, shouts into the hallway) MY WALLET'S GONE! MY WALLET'S GONE! I had my wallet in my back pocket. It's gone.
Twice! And Dembrow doesn't even know you. His son happens to live on your floor.
Jerry, I'll tell ya. The first thing I'm gonna do when I get back to Florida is take a shower.
Well you don't have to retract it because we never went.
You know Jack, you've got a hell of a nerve taking that kid's pen.
(to Helen) You don't want it? Are you kidding?
Who's off the street? I'm in the raincoat business for thirty-five years.
That's what the city's turning into. They'll steal anything.
Only twenty-five minutes a day, and you can attach it to any doorknob.
Oh, yeah, I'll be lying on an X-Ray table with my wallet in my mouth.
Jack is emceeing tomorrow. He's in charge of the whole thing.
Finder's fee is ten percent and no more.
Well what's the difference we'll go some place else.
You know Jack, do me a favor will you? Take the pen and the scotch tape, and get the hell out of here!
Make sure Kramer uses good tape when he sends back the raincoats.
Six hundred and sixty-three dollars and forty-five cents. And that's figuring conservatively at five percent interest, over fifty-three years, compounded quarterly. Or, if you put it into a ten-year T-bill...
Look at this! Look at this! (excited) You bought a Cadillac?!
Yknow Jerry, its a good thing I wasnt so particular.
I'm sorry, we can't go back to Florida.
So, you stand in the lobby, by the elevator, and wait for her to come down for lunch.
Ahh! Ahh! So YOU got the scotch tape! I've been looking all over for it!
Listen, is it all right if we move in with you for a little while? Sounds of breaking glass, Jerry dropped his bottle.
That had nothing to do with it, the man was out of shape.
You don't understand. I can't allow my son to pay for me. Look, as soon as I get back to Florida, I promise you I'll mail you a check.
So that night I cut off the loops and the Executive was born.
(loud) Tell them when you took my son's pen back. Tell them about that! (he gets up)
It doesn't make a difference. They think we're in cahoots.
Aw, Jerry. I should be buyin' you presents.
Jerry, what time do we have to be at the the Tonight Show on Thursday.
You don't understand, you gotta have a buffer zone.
What did you have? You had the minute steak?
Izzy used to work out with Charles Atlas in the fifties.
Bye bye. (hugging Jerry) Thanks again for the wallet.
So why dont you ask someone who was at the party?
Just a second. (Goes to grab the phone)
Alright. Next thing on the agenda, the restoration of the fence at the Briarwood gate. At the present time, we are still accepting bids.
Would you excuse me please, we're conducting business here.
So, when do I get to see the doctor?
I dont know how youre going to be comfortable like that.
Do you know what the interest on that fifty dollars comes to over fifty-three years?
I'm sorry Leo's moving back here. I'm not ready to go back to Florida.
You know what the flight backll cost us?
They're not kicking me out. You don't have the votes.
(to Leo) I don't understand this jeweller, Jimmy Sherman. (indicates Jerry) He brings in a watch, it takes over a week to fix. He fixed yours in one day.
How the hell am I gonna pay for this?
D'you realise, an above-average performing growth mutual fund for fifty-three years...
I sure did. Raincoats were my business. The Executive was a classic, these haven't been made in twenty years.
This is a huge scandal! We need damage control.
Well, she cant be too mad. Shes still coming to the wedding.
We saw Regis Philbin get out of a limousine.
All right, all right, Let's go already. They keep you in here a year. They don't give a damn. I could die in here. . . .(open the door and shouts into the hallway) Excuse me! Excuse me! What's going on? I'm here twenty minutes. Could somebody please help me.
That's right. Have you ever heard of anything like that?
Don't worry. I'll get to the other functions. (trying to open it) I can't get it open.
Alright alright, goodbye. (Morty hangs up the phone, Jack hangs up the phone) I don't think we are gonna make that flight.
I say the guy was painting without his glasses.
I'll tell you how crazy I am, I'm gonna pay for this whole trip with these coats.
I am not interested in his diagnosis. He's a bum.
Where do you come off with this crap?
Barefoot in the clubhouse? Don't you realize this is against the rules.
So, I can use it in the restaurant to figure out the tip?
Those are my coats. I saved them, I stored them, I've been waiting years for this pay off.
From Maryland. The one who brought you the chocolate covered cherries you didnt like.
Yeah, looks like you're getting a little spare tire there, tiger.
You see, he had the right idea. Hold out. That's how you get the big money, huh George? (slaps George on the shoulder)
You don't understand, I've come this far, I can't stop now.
(Jerry comes out of his room, having just woken up) Rise and shine, sleepy head! Ha ha!
Attaboy! Helen, Jerry got me a hot Wizard computer!
What're you talking about? You had a cheque bounce at the bodega.
Hey! This is the kind of room Sinatra stays in. Hey! look , Macadamian nuts.
Well one day somebody's going to sleep on that thing and we'll get sued. I hope this doctor knows what he's doing.
How would you feel if we sold the Cadillac?
You got enough here for a life sentence.
(looking around) This is some office. What's the square footage?
Hey! Leo, get this, four movies at once; Pay Per View.
Hey, I agree with him. Nobody likes a kid with a pony.
(unpanicked) There's already an ambulance here for Mrs Glickman. There's room for one more.
No proof? We'll get him. He's a crook, sooner or later, he'll slip up.
Jerry have you ever seen any of those impressionist paintings?
Because the Costanzas are moving into Del Boca Vista.
What are you talking about? I'm the one who should have called the police. They stole my wallet.
Hey! You know what these cost, they're like 80 cents a nut.
What are you talking? Jeffrey works for the parks department!
(to Helen) Slept on the job? (she shushed him)
