Hey, I agree with him. Nobody likes a kid with a pony.
You don't understand fashion is cyclical this thing could come back.
But there are no stamps on these.
Say those are some nice pants. I got a pair just like them at home.
Well then what do they make appointments for if they can't keep them. Huh, hha. Look if I did that in my business I wouldn't have made a nickel.
Do you know what the interest on that fifty dollars comes to over fifty-three years?
Jack can afford to give away a pen with all his money. Believe me. He gives me a check for 19.45. He didn't have a Coke. Ho, ho, ho!
Congratulations, Mr. President.
Boy, you are really something.
She's got priors.
What nervous?
Barefoot in the clubhouse? Don't you realize this is against the rules.
Oh, well...
What are you worried about?
Well, maybe you better make a pot of tea, too.
You know Jack, do me a favor will you? Take the pen and the scotch tape, and get the hell out of here!
What was that?
Yes, I do!
That didn't sound like the Golden Nugget.
Helen, did you know that they tape this thing in the afternoon?
Well, go up to the office.
There are twenty people on the board. Thank God you can get that deal.
See that? You couldn't do that.
I keep telling her it's like an oven in here.
(to Jack, loud) That's what you say.
So, you stand in the lobby, by the elevator, and wait for her to come down for lunch.
(standing) Okay, I'm done. I'll be back in the morning, when he's close to finish with his story.
You believe this?
All right, all right.
(to Helen) You don't want it? Are you kidding?
"My Fair Lady"
How could you not get the insurance?
Hey guys . Jerry . Kramer
So, I can use it in the restaurant to figure out the tip?
Doesnt sound like youre friends to me. If you were friends you'd-youd ask her for the number. Do you know where this other one works?
Uh huh.
You know what the flight backll cost us?
What the hell are you doing here?
Listen, is it all right if we move in with you for a little while? Sounds of breaking glass, Jerry dropped his bottle.
The Mandelbaums own the Magic Pan restaurants.
(loud) Tell them when you took my son's pen back. Tell them about that! (he gets up)
We'll take a bus.
Nice to see you, Mrs Choate.
Low flow? I don't like the sound of that.
Come on. That's enough, sit down!
You're a terrific kid.
Welcome to Florida!
How was I supposed to pay? I didn't have my wallet.
Aha!
They're not kicking me out. You don't have the votes.
Well you don't have to retract it because we never went.
If they get the votes.
Its nothing. I got it. So, how are your levels coming along?
Depends on the firm.
Jerry, don't go.
What'ya got leather seats here?
You didn't give it to him.
So, when do I get to see the doctor?
Maybe a couple of muscle relaxers would help.
I dont know how youre going to be comfortable like that.
What are you talking? Jeffrey works for the parks department!
Hey, thats some big job.
Hello. Hello, Mrs Choate.
We saw Regis Philbin get out of a limousine.
Oh come on!
Now Jerry please, do not do this to your father. Over my dead body Jerry. I'll tell you right now, you're not going to do it.
(skeptical) Thousands?!
Nobody uses it.
You don't understand, I've come this far, I can't stop now.
I'm not talking loud!
You dont understand, Ive never paid a full fare.
What's not to understand?
Don't you think he had to be uh near sighted? I mean know body would paint like that if they could see. It's all out of focus.
What?
We're going with a select charter group.
How long they been doing this?
Oh, for Gods sake!
I'm sorry, we can't go back to Florida.
Ahh! Ahh! So YOU got the scotch tape! I've been looking all over for it!
nan
Hey, these are very comfortable pants. You know what I paid for these Jerry?
(searching in a kitchen drawer) What happened to the scotch tape? Who takes the scotch tape? Nobody returns anything around here.
I came home one night, and I tripped over one of Jerry's toys. (Jerry smiling points to himself and nods with cards in his hands) So I took out my belt just to threaten him, and I got a glimpse of myself in the mirror.
They stole my wallet.
Maybe some people don't like him. I could see that.
You ever see one so nice?
Who is it?
What're you talking about?
You're packing cereal?
Tell your parents we said 'Hi!' (They leave)
Hey! This is the kind of room Sinatra stays in. Hey! look , Macadamian nuts.
Well, if he fixes my back I'll be happy. . . . (back to the form) Have you ever had a sexually transmitted disease? That's IT! . . . Here, you got my name, you got my address. That's enough.
Would you excuse me please, we're conducting business here.
What?
Always, Jerry. Always.
Bye, Mr. Kramer.
(shocked) A thousand?! I know a coupla Chinamen over there on Forty-third Street, who'll do it for half that.
You got enough here for a life sentence.
Maybe you should see a doctor.
Quones not a word.
You don't understand, you gotta have a buffer zone.
He doesnt want to ask Elaine for the number.
Buh bye Elaine
I'm very comfortable working outta the house. I have a phone, we have a Kinko's nearby. You know, I think that my resume speaks for itself.
Finder's fee is ten percent and no more.
Oh! Oh! That feels good. Hey! This guy charges a hundred bucks an hour but I'm telling ya he's worth every penny OOOOHH!
(rushing to his bedroom) First, I need a nap.
Aw, Jerry. I should be buyin' you presents.
Whats the matter? You need a lawyer?
Oh my God! What the hell happened to you?
Jerry have you ever seen any of those impressionist paintings?
I'll make a few phone calls.
That's the second time you said "personal favor". Why do you keep saying that?
Ok, bye.
(without looking up) Who are they?
Anyway there are these three big boxes, you can't miss them. I want you to ship them here to New York for me.
Send them tomorrow.
Just do it first thing tomorrow. I need it.
What are you talking about?
Hello Jack.
Should I pick up?
So that night I cut off the loops and the Executive was born.
Jerry, why didn't you get them Wizards?
Are you getting that?
Ah, good-bye.
What are you, nuts?
So why dont you ask someone who was at the party?
He's not gonna return the pen. That's ridiculous.
You're out of your mind.
Who's Mr Fancy?
I told you to send them express.
Look, I got a few good years left. If I want a Chip Ahoy, I'm having it.
(indicating) So, how d'you like this?
Twenty minutes. I've been waiting twenty minutes.
What for?
No, we just came for the funeral. `
(Morty goes on louder! Did he ever whisper in any episode? -) Why do you need more friends? You've got plenty of friends.
That's right. They went like hotcakes.
I'm ready
Hey, Mr. Kramer!
I'll tell you how crazy I am, I'm gonna pay for this whole trip with these coats.
A present?
He's wearing one.
Believe me, I wouldnt bother you if the army hadnt closed that base in Sarasota. Here, scribble a little something here.
Ya so have I
He thought he could buy back that Cadillac for us? He's not getting away with that.
Yeah. This is all big crepe money.
All right. Make it 20 bucks.
So, howd you do?
What do you mean?
Aw! Aw! Oh my back! Oh my back! It's that bar. Who the hell could sleep on that thing?
I got a guarantee on that watch. Give it to me, I'll take it back to where we got it.
There she is.
What're you talking about? You had a cheque bounce at the bodega.
All this? This whole thing? It's going to take me forty-five minutes.
Get out of here.
And smart! Like a computer!
Bring me the receipt.
My idiot son could open that garage door.
Alright, Leo.
Yeah.
Only twenty-five minutes a day, and you can attach it to any doorknob.
Alright alright, goodbye. (Morty hangs up the phone, Jack hangs up the phone) I don't think we are gonna make that flight.
I'll call Jack Klompus, he's got a key to the garage. He can send them overnight delivery.
My son never stole anything. He's a good boy.
How're your folks?
Yeah, yeah, you make money.
From Maryland. The one who brought you the chocolate covered cherries you didnt like.
Wrap it up, we'll take it home.
That's a good idea.
I'm paying.
Oh, yeah. I forgot all about it.
(getting up from the table and coming over) Why is that?
How about Loni Anderson?
They'll be here first thing Thursday morning.
I wanted a Chip Ahoy.
(looking around) This is some office. What's the square footage?
Jack Klompus gave us six grand.
We're keeping it.
(walking back out of the room) Don't tell your mother.
This looks like too much money.
You don't understand my...
Hey! Look at this, a wallet. Exactly what I needed, y'see.
Jerry, you ever watch that?
I don't think we even use it.
(opening his tracksuit top) See what I'm wearing?
You know I've been thinking, why is Kramer getting twenty-five percent?
Hey, George!
When are we gonna tell Jerry?
What?
Oooh! Heh heh! It's a radar detector.
I told her you'd get married. She thought you'd never do it.
(noticing Kramer's coat) Look at that, Helen do you see what he's wearing? That's the Executive.
You know what my greatest moment was, dont you? Nineteen-forty-six. I went to work for Harry Flemming and I came up with the idea for the beltless trenchcoat.
(trying to press the cheque on Jerry) And we want you to have the money.
Ok, let's go.
Hey Jerry. Number One here. Did you go see Izzy at the back specialist?
That's terrific!
This is it.
Bye bye. (hugging Jerry) Thanks again for the wallet.
Go to the building. She goes out to lunch, doesnt she?
Don't tell me about business! I sold raincoats for thirty-five years!
Jerry!
Look at this. Look at how this idiot packed it. He didn't tape it, he just flipped the flaps. (Kramer, Morty and Jerry are looking around grabbing raincoats which are scattered all over the place.) Kramer you missed a couple.
What did you have? You had the minute steak?
I'm gonna explain what boxes.
What're you doing? Are you making coffee?
Hello Elaine
They're good around the house -- and they're good for outside.
Got lucky.
What's all that?
Hey! Leo, get this, four movies at once; Pay Per View.
Why the hell didn't you tell us?
What? Im gonna buy a new sport jacket now?
Leo, I'm listening to Leo now!
How come he gets to leave?
I'll get a book.
Maybe we can get an army transport flight. They got a base in Sarasota, I think.
This is a huge scandal! We need damage control.
What the hell are you looking for?
Hey! I do you like this? Huh, huh!
Hello Elaine
I got my sport jacket.
Who's that?
You know Jack, you've got a hell of a nerve taking that kid's pen.
Jack is emceeing tomorrow. He's in charge of the whole thing.
I haven't been able to reach him. Hey I'll call him right now.
What kind of clip joint are ya running here?
All right, Leo.
I knew it, I told you!
That's what the city's turning into. They'll steal anything.
I'm thinking more like fifteen.
Izzy used to work out with Charles Atlas in the fifties.
Because the Costanzas are moving into Del Boca Vista.
This shirt will never leave my body.
(eating lunch with Helen and Jerry) Another fine meal, and now for my Wizard tip calculator.
Look at this! Look at this! (excited) You bought a Cadillac?!
You wanna take a ride?
Maybe I should talk to Elaine.
Hello Rachel.
Ill get it!
Astronaut!
I tell you, he bought it for me!
Oh, yeah, I'll be lying on an X-Ray table with my wallet in my mouth.
19.45$ ?
(to Jerry) Can you believe this?!
No, no, he won't let me do that.
No, your mother found it. Son, this is the most wonderful and thoughtful thing you've ever done for me.
I'll tell you what I'm looking at the next condo president of Del Boca Vista, Phase Three.
So, how did she find out?
What are you talking? We use it.
I wanna tell you. This is one of the most thoughtful gifts anyone's ever given me.
By the time we sit down, it'll be quarter to five.
How the hell am I gonna pay for this?
What was that?
You should be! How could you spend two hundred dollars on a tip calculator?!
No, no, no. He knows how to talk to these people. No-one's gonna take advantage of Georgie. (slaps George's shoulder again)
because she puts up such a big stink every time I have a piece of meat.
Because if you are, you shouldn't. There's nothing available in that development.
I don't have it. I'll mail you one.
What are you kidding me?
Jerry's a comedian.
All right, all right, Let's go already. They keep you in here a year. They don't give a damn. I could die in here. . . .(open the door and shouts into the hallway) Excuse me! Excuse me! What's going on? I'm here twenty minutes. Could somebody please help me.
Leo, let's go.
Hello.
That had nothing to do with it, the man was out of shape.
Don't lie Jerry.
Call an ambulance.
We can't stand them.
We'll round down.
Because we had a buyer, and we couldn't get a free flight until now.
Hello, Jerry? It's your father.
I don't see envelopes!
Well, it's getting kinda late, why don't we uh...
Don't worry about it.
(to Helen) Slept on the job? (she shushed him)
Hello.
I'll sleep standing up. I'll be fine.
Hoh, here he is. This is the man I wanted you to see. Izzy Mandelbaum. He's eighty years old, but strong as an ox. (pointing) Watch this.
So what did you do about the window?
So much the better.
Hey, Jerry.
Yeah. They give you a tenderloin, a salad and a baked potato, for four-ninety-five. You know what that cost you after six?
No, no put it away . . .
Jerry, I'll tell ya. The first thing I'm gonna do when I get back to Florida is take a shower.
Tomorrow afternoon?
The service was slow. And God forbid they should refill the water. How does 12.4% sound?
Are you ready for dessert?
That's right, they're my coats.
Well, I sold raincoats in the garment centre for thirty-eight years. In nineteen forty-nine...
(shout) Jerry!
You don't say? You know I have boxes of those sitting in my garage in Florida?
Morty Seinfeld. I cut velvet for forty years with Harry Altman.
So look.
Aah! (Jack leaves) The nerve of that guy! Taking back that pen. Well that's it for them.
Yeah, looks like you're getting a little spare tire there, tiger.
Plus the insurance.
(coming into the hall) This is the home stretch. Tomorrow's the election!
D'you realise, an above-average performing growth mutual fund for fifty-three years...
Nervous, Jack?
That's giving it away. This is a one of a kind item.
Helen, will you stop bothering him.
(to the crowd) He gave my son a pen, and then he takes it back. Tell them about that!
Tell him to eat a plum.
My son bought me that car!
Raincoats.
Hey Jerry, look at this. My seat's got a memory, in case somebody moves it. I could be in prison for five years. I come out, my seat goes right back to where I like it.
Jerry, this is Del Boca Vista's new physical fitness room. They got medicine balls, you can bike ride, anything you want.
Hey, Mr. Kramer. Ha ha ha.
You just heard about this today?
Daily what?
So ask Elaine there for her number.
(indicates the new wallet) It's velcro.
Twice! And Dembrow doesn't even know you. His son happens to live on your floor.
Hey, Georgie-boy, how are ya?
If anything you're getting too much.
How the hell do you work this thing?
This was a gift from my son.
Hello
Yeah, so?
I'm still going to Paris. I got a big deal cooking here.
Here, I got it.
Who needs this?
What are you talking about? What was I supposed to hide it somewhere?
And its always about Jeffrey, right?
What are you talking about? I'm the one who should have called the police. They stole my wallet.
Why would he mind? We're his parents.
Your mother doesn't like my taste in clothing.
You don't even think about it, there's so much going on.
They give you that *Fish.*
Uh we'll drive around for a while.
(from outside the door; singing) I could have danced all night (entering with Helen) I could have danced all night and still have
(comes to the kitchen and with a loud voice) Why are you whispering?
Yes, I'm sure. I went in to get my X-Ray, Somebody takes my wallet. Is that the operation here?
C'mon, take a ride.
You see, he had the right idea. Hold out. That's how you get the big money, huh George? (slaps George on the shoulder)
(simultaneous) Hey!/That's wonderful!/We got a deal!
George is right. Those people will try to get away with murder. Believe me. They're all crooks.
Yeah, while I was in getting X-Rayed.
Alright Jer.
Why not?
You don't think it's fair.
Make sure Kramer uses good tape when he sends back the raincoats.
Will you stop it Jerry. Let go.
(dismissive) Ahh!
You said you didn't want it!
This isn't a Wizard, it's a Willard.
(on the phone) Hello Jack.
(still loud) What about her?
But it comes on 1130.
Did you have a coke or what?
Hi, Morty Seinfeld. I have a two o'clock appointment.
Yea
(to Leo) I don't understand this jeweller, Jimmy Sherman. (indicates Jerry) He brings in a watch, it takes over a week to fix. He fixed yours in one day.
Hey! You know what these cost, they're like 80 cents a nut.
Don't worry about it.
You what? You bought me a Cadillac?
Well, I, as your president, have to find the best price, and right now, I for one, do not think it's cost-feasible.
Well one day somebody's going to sleep on that thing and we'll get sued. I hope this doctor knows what he's doing.
Astronaut?
(to the chiro) Who are you?
Well we do.
Six hundred and sixty-three dollars and forty-five cents. And that's figuring conservatively at five percent interest, over fifty-three years, compounded quarterly. Or, if you put it into a ten-year T-bill...
What about the end, with the list?
No proof? We'll get him. He's a crook, sooner or later, he'll slip up.
You know that number?
Did you send them?
Because I have the votes.
Alright, are you ready to eat?
He never even called Ed Roydlick. They were looking for someone!
What did you say?
Just a second. (Goes to grab the phone)
(unconcerned) Ach, I never knew what the hell I was peddling with those stupid cartoons and that paper book, anyway.
Somebody had a coke.
It's mine.
It's Morty
Stealing?!
You broke the window?
You didn't have a deal?
Ah, there he is!
So bring a snack-pack.
(determined) Well, he's not getting away with this!
So, what are you? Afraid of her?
Just watch me do my thing.
I'm sorry Leo's moving back here. I'm not ready to go back to Florida.
My son bought me the car. It's a present.
I'd have to go back to work.
Well, she cant be too mad. Shes still coming to the wedding.
He pretends he bumped into her!
yeah, he's supposed to be the emcee.
Cheap fabric, and dim lighting. That's how you move merchandise.
(standing) Okay. Tomorrow, Jerry and I will visit Izzy and apologise. Now, goodnight.
Know body died. Jack I want you to do me a big favor. (Jerry holding up some cards looking at his father) In my garage there are a couple of boxes.
No-one's ever been impeached before. I couldn't live here. We'd have to move to Boca.
You gotta pull on the knob as you turn it.
Could you believe that guy?
And every morning I eat a plum.
He gave him the pen.
(to George as he is about to leave) Hey give 'em our best though.
Why, whats wrong with Loni Anderson?
First Leo breaks up, then he goes back. What the hell's going on?
What the hell is going on here?
He could wash them.
Alright, let's get going.
Outside? What's going on?
(holding Jerry's shoulders) Jerry lives in New York. You just came from New York, didn't you?
I dont know her either. (gesturing to Helen) She makes me fly all the way from Florida for this, and then she criticizes my jacket.
You don't understand. I can't allow my son to pay for me. Look, as soon as I get back to Florida, I promise you I'll mail you a check.
Oh, you don't see. You don't see. Well it happened. Believe me.
He'll send them express.
Alright. Next thing on the agenda, the restoration of the fence at the Briarwood gate. At the present time, we are still accepting bids.
You won't regret this, Miss Benes. What time should I be in? I get up at four, I could be here as early as four twenty-five.
Look, if we're gonna stay here until all hours of the night, can we at least get some food here?
So what, why is that worth twenty-five percent? It's a finders fee. You know what a finders fee is?
Ok it's a deal
Jack have some spong cake.
Where do you come off with this crap?
What leg work?
His pen.
Helen, we got into restaurants and figure out the tips.
(oblivious to the above) Two exact same watches. He tells you a week, and him a day. How could that be? Something's fishy about this.
It's too much car, Jerry.
Sorbonne? Oh, hey. (To Helen) That's in Paris.
Well what's the difference we'll go some place else.
Hey! Under Siege is on again. Whose up for it?
You gotta deal.
(depressed) You know what this funerals gonna wind up costing me? Oh boy!
Bye, Jer.
Number One, signing off.
Well you're not getting thirty-five.
Pinko Commie rag.
Nothing nothing.
So, what took you so long?
HaAhhh! The Velcro. I can't stand Velcro. It's that t-e-a-r-I-n-g sound. I used to be in raincoats. I refused to put that in any of my lines.
I was never impeached! I resigned!
That's right. Have you ever heard of anything like that?
What?
I say the guy was painting without his glasses.
(Morty gets up) Oh! I forgot all about it.
Plum...(Jerry hangs up.)
Oh my God! She's gotta make a big deal out of everything.
(surprised) President?
(checking pants) They stole my wallet. The bum stole my wallet. (opens door, shouts into the hallway) MY WALLET'S GONE! MY WALLET'S GONE! I had my wallet in my back pocket. It's gone.
Helen, did you pack my travel gym?
No no, the luggage is on the program. I got a brick in here.
I did so thank him!
You send me the bill.
It doesn't make a difference. They think we're in cahoots.
Stop it.
We got plenty of time.
Hiya Kramer.
(to Jerry) You remember Jack and Doris?
Boy that was some show.
Not really.
You didn't get in?
I am not interested in his diagnosis. He's a bum.
I don't want it!
Who's off the street? I'm in the raincoat business for thirty-five years.
Those are my coats. I saved them, I stored them, I've been waiting years for this pay off.
Oh, that one. She's been a member of the board longer than anybody. She's very tough to deal with.
