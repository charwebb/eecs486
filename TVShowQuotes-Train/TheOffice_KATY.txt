[looking at Roy and Pam] They are soo cute.
This one's really good for a hot date.
I think you've made a really good choice, she's really going to like that.
I should probably get back to my table.
I guess a cup of coffee would be great.
You guys, it's like we're in high school and we're at the cool table. Right?
So do you like the periwinkle and the purples?
What is wrong with you? Why did you even bring me here tonight?
Yes, I did! [chanting] A-W-E-S-O-M-E! Awesome! Awesome is what we are! We're the football superstars! A-W-E-S-O-M-E!
Goodnight, it was nice nice to meet some of you.
Guys are usually my best customers, they buy the high end stuff like the beads and the sequins and stuff. For gifts, you know?  They don't know what they are looking at. So I make suggestions.
I'd like to be engaged. How did you manage to pull that off?
Gosh, I would love to but, my purses, I should, um...
Oh, nothing.  My ride just bailed on me.
Oh no, it's fine that you, um. Here, what about the raspberry one? It's really uh, kind of festive. It's got a lot of personality.
Congratulations.  You need a hot date more than anyone.
No. I really don't want to inconvenience you.
I uh, I probably should have told you, I don't need a ride now 'cause Jim can take me home after so you're off the hook.
You seem to like to touch things. Did you try the velvet?
Okay, I guess that would be, I guess that would be okay.
