I'm not sure. It's faux snakeskin.
Hi!
Bishop O'Hara.
You got that?
I think you've made a really good choice, she's really going to like that.
Okay.
It's a... it's a very nice car.
Gosh, I would love to but, my purses, I should, um...
Okay.
I'm Katy.
What colors do you like?
You seem to like to touch things. Did you try the velvet?
Thanks.
I wouldn't think of it.
Why?
I'm good. It's good to see you.
Oh, thank you.
We could do that ten years ago.
No. I really don't want to inconvenience you.
No.
Thank you.
Hi.
Yeah.
Okay, I guess that would be, I guess that would be okay.
Yeah, toast! Toast! Toast!
Everybody, everybody? There is a toast. Come on...
Jim, come on, don't be shy.
You're really into reptiles, huh?
I should probably get back to my table.
I can't.
Good.
Cool.
Okay, um...
It's very popular, yeah.
[to Pam] Come back...
That's hilarious.
Okay.
Cool. What year were you there?
Um, for the... the desert island.
Is that from Starbucks?
Wow, thanks.
At five?
Alright! You want to drive?
You guys, it's like we're in high school and we're at the cool table. Right?
No.
Hi
So do you like the periwinkle and the purples?
No, I don't believe that.
Ha. Yeah, asks a lot of questions.
Okay. Cool.
[laughs]
Congratulations.  You need a hot date more than anyone.
Good. Here. Squeeze it inside.
Regular coffee is fine.
Thank you.
Oh.
You should make a toast.
Oh, nothing.  My ride just bailed on me.
I'm hungry.
What?
No really it is.
This one's really good for a hot date.
Oh no, it's um...
Okay. [laughs]
Alright.
Katy.
Yeah.
Wow. Is that for the office?
What is wrong with you? Why did you even bring me here tonight?
Guys are usually my best customers, they buy the high end stuff like the beads and the sequins and stuff. For gifts, you know?  They don't know what they are looking at. So I make suggestions.
I uh, I probably should have told you, I don't need a ride now 'cause Jim can take me home after so you're off the hook.
[looking at Roy and Pam] They are soo cute.
Yes, I did! [chanting] A-W-E-S-O-M-E! Awesome! Awesome is what we are! We're the football superstars! A-W-E-S-O-M-E!
Cool, what year where you there?
That was on Sesame Street.
Do you think that'll ever be us?
I really can't.
Both.
Hi.
Pam, were you a cheerleader?
Whoa. What?
Oh, um, it's okay.
I don't think so I'm really busy.
I guess a cup of coffee would be great.
No.
Cheers.
Bring it on.
Oh, I have been thinking the whole way over and I have my answers.
