Good. Here. Squeeze it inside.
[laughs]
Okay.
Hi.
I'm gonna go back to my table.
Congratulations.  You need a hot date more than anyone.
Oh, um, it's okay.
Bishop O'Hara.
Gosh, I would love to but, my purses, I should, um...
Katy.
At five?
Yeah.
It's very popular, yeah.
You seem to like to touch things. Did you try the velvet?
Ha. Yeah, asks a lot of questions.
Okay.
No.
You guys, it's like we're in high school and we're at the cool table. Right?
Guys are usually my best customers, they buy the high end stuff like the beads and the sequins and stuff. For gifts, you know?  They don't know what they are looking at. So I make suggestions.
I can't.
[to Pam] Come back...
No. I really don't want to inconvenience you.
So do you like the periwinkle and the purples?
Cool, what year where you there?
No...
Okay, I guess that would be, I guess that would be okay.
Okay. [laughs]
Goodnight, it was nice nice to meet some of you.
[whispers] Sorry.
That's hilarious.
Oh, nothing.  My ride just bailed on me.
Both.
Is that from Starbucks?
You got that?
I think you've made a really good choice, she's really going to like that.
Cheers.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, I have been thinking the whole way over and I have my answers.
What is wrong with you? Why did you even bring me here tonight?
Alright.
Do you think that'll ever be us?
You should make a toast.
Hi!
Thank you.
I guess a cup of coffee would be great.
Cool. What year were you there?
Regular coffee is fine.
Yes, I did! [chanting] A-W-E-S-O-M-E! Awesome! Awesome is what we are! We're the football superstars! A-W-E-S-O-M-E!
What?
Oh no, it's um...
Everybody, everybody? There is a toast. Come on...
I'm hungry.
I wouldn't think of it.
Cool.
You're really into reptiles, huh?
Wow, thanks.
I don't think so I'm really busy.
Oh no, it's fine that you, um. Here, what about the raspberry one? It's really uh, kind of festive. It's got a lot of personality.
No.
Thank you.
I should probably get back to my table.
Yeah, toast! Toast! Toast!
Okay.
Thanks.
No.
Wow. Is that for the office?
No really it is.
I uh, I probably should have told you, I don't need a ride now 'cause Jim can take me home after so you're off the hook.
Okay, um, first, Legally Blond.
Good.
Yeah.
Okay, um...
I'd like to be engaged. How did you manage to pull that off?
How are you?
What colors do you like?
Um, for the... the desert island.
We could do that ten years ago.
[looking at Roy and Pam] They are soo cute.
Hi
This one's really good for a hot date.
Hi.
I'm not sure. It's faux snakeskin.
You sit out there, don't you?
I really can't.
I'm good. It's good to see you.
Jim, come on, don't be shy.
It's a... it's a very nice car.
Oh.
