Gosh, I would love to but, my purses, I should, um...
Yes, I did! [chanting] A-W-E-S-O-M-E! Awesome! Awesome is what we are! We're the football superstars! A-W-E-S-O-M-E!
You guys, it's like we're in high school and we're at the cool table. Right?
This one's really good for a hot date.
I'd like to be engaged. How did you manage to pull that off?
I uh, I probably should have told you, I don't need a ride now 'cause Jim can take me home after so you're off the hook.
I guess a cup of coffee would be great.
Guys are usually my best customers, they buy the high end stuff like the beads and the sequins and stuff. For gifts, you know?  They don't know what they are looking at. So I make suggestions.
Oh, nothing.  My ride just bailed on me.
I should probably get back to my table.
Okay, I guess that would be, I guess that would be okay.
What is wrong with you? Why did you even bring me here tonight?
Goodnight, it was nice nice to meet some of you.
I think you've made a really good choice, she's really going to like that.
So do you like the periwinkle and the purples?
Oh, I have been thinking the whole way over and I have my answers.
You seem to like to touch things. Did you try the velvet?
[looking at Roy and Pam] They are soo cute.
Everybody, everybody? There is a toast. Come on...
No. I really don't want to inconvenience you.
