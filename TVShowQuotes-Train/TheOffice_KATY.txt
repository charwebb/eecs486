Hi!
Wow, thanks.
Yeah.
[whispers] Sorry.
Hi.
I don't think so I'm really busy.
Yeah.
That was on Sesame Street.
Thank you.
Goodnight, it was nice nice to meet some of you.
Regular coffee is fine.
Okay. Cool.
Guys are usually my best customers, they buy the high end stuff like the beads and the sequins and stuff. For gifts, you know?  They don't know what they are looking at. So I make suggestions.
Oh, nothing.  My ride just bailed on me.
Why?
No, I don't believe that.
So do you like the periwinkle and the purples?
Hi
Alright.
I'm Katy.
Hi.
Okay, um, first, Legally Blond.
I'm hungry.
No.
I should probably get back to my table.
Katy.
Ha. Yeah, asks a lot of questions.
Do you think that'll ever be us?
Oh.
Whoa. What?
Gosh, I would love to but, my purses, I should, um...
I guess a cup of coffee would be great.
You should make a toast.
Cool, what year where you there?
That's hilarious.
Okay, I guess that would be, I guess that would be okay.
No.
I'm good. It's good to see you.
Cool. What year were you there?
Everybody, everybody? There is a toast. Come on...
Is that from Starbucks?
Oh, I have been thinking the whole way over and I have my answers.
It's a... it's a very nice car.
No...
Alright! You want to drive?
At five?
Thanks.
Oh no, it's fine that you, um. Here, what about the raspberry one? It's really uh, kind of festive. It's got a lot of personality.
How are you?
I'm gonna go back to my table.
I really can't.
Congratulations.  You need a hot date more than anyone.
Okay, um...
Oh, um, it's okay.
Both.
Cool.
Good. Here. Squeeze it inside.
Yes, I did! [chanting] A-W-E-S-O-M-E! Awesome! Awesome is what we are! We're the football superstars! A-W-E-S-O-M-E!
We could do that ten years ago.
I'm not sure. It's faux snakeskin.
I can't.
You're really into reptiles, huh?
Oh no, it's um...
What?
[laughs]
You got that?
Okay.
Jim, come on, don't be shy.
I'd like to be engaged. How did you manage to pull that off?
I uh, I probably should have told you, I don't need a ride now 'cause Jim can take me home after so you're off the hook.
I wouldn't think of it.
You sit out there, don't you?
No. I really don't want to inconvenience you.
Okay.
This one's really good for a hot date.
Cheers.
You seem to like to touch things. Did you try the velvet?
Okay. [laughs]
I think you've made a really good choice, she's really going to like that.
It's very popular, yeah.
Thank you.
Yeah, toast! Toast! Toast!
Bishop O'Hara.
No really it is.
Bring it on.
[to Pam] Come back...
Wow. Is that for the office?
What colors do you like?
