She is our boss.
We should probably head on down and hook up with Jan.
They're exclusive with Staples.
Um, we should...
Jan, hey.
Okay, just get it done.  Jim, will you make sure?
Hey Andy!
[sounding upset] Andy, Jim, can I see you in the conference room for a minute?
All right. Think you guys should be all set. Oh, here's the corporate card for dinner.
All right, Jan just emailed me. She wants us to meet her up front.
This is not working, ok?  We are getting slaughtered out there.
Wow. Uh, sure. Absolutely.
I'm sorry, all right? It's done, it's done.
What's going on with Fairfield County schools?  Karen, did you generate that price list?
JIM!
As of today, I have accepted a senior managment position at Staples.
Uh... we'll do it later.
Or what?  We didn't bet anything, Michael.
[sighs]
Yeah, stop by later.
Yeah, we should go.
And Karen? Let's keep it to twenty dollars a person this time.
Yeah, let's change the subject.
Um... When I was in the Coast Guard, a couple of us broke into the women's barracks and we got arrested for trespassing.
Did you?
You hooked up with Jan?
Jim got us a great lead with a new rep from National Envelope. We can grab lunch with them tomorrow.
SNIPE--
Excuse me, Jan, I'm sorry... I'm gonna have to stop you there. I, um, will not be taking the job.
Thank you, everyone.
A shot of MIDORI, perhaps.
Thanks, but maybe another time.
And I just want to let you know that if our branch absorbs your branch, I'm going to look for a place for you at Stamford.
I just want to say thanks. Good luck.
I don't think so.
You know what, Jim, I wouldn't worry about it.
[stunned]
Sure, what's up?
So, end of day we are going to have a little diversity policy refresher, because of some more problems at the Scranton branch.  And I have a list of business startups I got from the chamber.  Yes, I am going to need someone to cold call them.
Andy, it's not---
All right.
What about you, Craig, you lose anyone?
Yes.
Thank you.
Listen, Michael, I heard you were a great salesman.
I honestly don't. I don't know.
Fine! All right.
Okay.
[nods]
Yes now.
You don't snipe in Carrington, ok?
We just need a strategy, ok?  We're going to set up a trap in the gun room.  All right Jim, are you using the MP-40 or the 44?
Hey, Michael.
Well, Jim and I have a meeting with Uni-ball in about forty-five minutes, so we should probably go now.
You know Dan Gore from Buffalo.
Nice to meet you.
We gotta go.
