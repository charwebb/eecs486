Gerald Broflovski, do you agree to let Apple track your location at all times?
Hi, my name is Leslie. I'll be your Genius.

What turns a normal, fat little eight-year-old boy into a vicious, hate-crime-committing racist? We take you live to the courtroom  as the defendant takes the stand.
Oh-kay, well I'm sorry you're having trouble with that today. Could I have his Apple ID?

Do you agree to care about your membership, and prove that you care by purchasing AppleCare?
It's very easy. You will simply need to join Apple.
Yeah, I think we should have a quickening, with all the Geniuses.
But if you join we can make your son's account into a family account, and then you have to iApprove all his agreements.
Okay, if you guys just wait here a sec we're gonna have a quickening with the Council of Geniuses. See what we can do for you.

Yeah, we got you a replacement friend. You should be all good to go.
