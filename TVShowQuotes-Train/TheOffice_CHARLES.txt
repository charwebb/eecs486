Great. Fax that to everyone on the distribution list.
I can't pretend I haven't seen that.  So I am going e to ask you to stand up, walk  out. And you can't take anything.
Yeah, he knows. He just wants a good manager.
Oh, Jim, you're putting a volleyball game in front of your fiance's health.
Ok. Nice meeting everyone. I'll see you in a couple of weeks.
Look who just woke up! [laughs, scores a point on the next play] I've been up for a while.
I don't know if I have hurt your feelings or you do not disagree with my methods, but it is over.
So you're the assistant to the regional manager?
We still have the inventory sitting-- [everyone starts chattering at once]
I wrote a memo to all departments asking them to find ways to save money but, uh--
Also, there has been too much wasted time.  So Stanley.
I am aware of the effect I have on woman.
I've just been impressed with your performance and I wanted to make sure good work doesn't go unnoticed.
He shows promise and Jim, I don't know-- I-- he's been a disappointment.
No. Hey, hey. I just want to hear 'yes'.
Hi. I need a rundown of your clients, can you get that to me.
Oh, I meant, I meant that Kelly. [New receptionist walks in]
Must be nice to get a rest from all your rest. [walks away]
Well, it's not for everybody I suppose. [Andy laughs]
The conference room is ready if we want to get started.
Whatcha got, Jim?...  What is a two-way petting zoo?
This doesn't seem like a good way to spend company time.
Okay, Jim Halpert. I need your eyes up front.
I do this for every branch I go to. If you do not like it, then I think there are some bagels left over from this morning.
Yeah, I want you to be on top of that okay?  I want you to be my productivity czar. Okay, good.  Uh, okay that it on my list. So uh, you know, no excuses guys. Lets get going okay? [everyone leaves except Kevin and Stanley, who are sitting stunned in their chairs]
[Dwight, Jim and Pam leave] Thank you very much.
Okay.  Hey, Dwight.  Can I talk to you?
Okay, do  not go anywhere near the conference room.
Yeah, I'm Charles Miner, here to see Michael Scott.
Ok, so we're on the same page, great.
Okay, let's go over non-discretionary cuts. Okay, guys? [Charles sees Stanley with his crossword, Charles stares and he puts it away] Thank you. So, umm...
That's not how I plan on doing things.
Nah, that's weird. You're gonna sit. [Dwight sits] Great. You know, Dwight, it has been quite a transition for all of us. Are you happy with the way things have been runnin' lately?
Actually, I meant questions more about the day-to-day operations of the company. Kay. [Andy raises hand] Yeah.
We need to talk about our two companies, and how we should behave. Dwight tells me you've been pestering him for company info.
Uh, no, sorry, Michael. No, Kevin, right? We're going to need you to do that during office hours.
Sp-Well, um, Michael should have filled you in last week.
See you on the field. Ha, ha. I can't wait!
This isn't a good use of company time, Michael.
It is official. It is official. And actually, guys, I'm encouraging branches to consider a freeze on discretionary spending.
Yeah, it looks like Pam won't make it back. Okay?
Woah, woah, woah, woah, you wanna get that looked at.
Excuse me, guys. What's going on in here?
What about you, Jim? You a fan of the game?
Is this something you really want to have said?
[on cell phone] Charles Miner. Hello? Hello, who is this? Who is this?
Let's see what you got in those legs!
Uh, I need you to go over this client list and indicate any wrong or false data.
Michael, I want you to stop pestering my salesmen, and I want you to leave Dunder Mifflin alone. Do you understand?
Yeah, I will. What I told Michael last week-
Hey, you know we're in tough times and we're not immune to this economy.
Uh, Jim hold on. [whispers] You know, David, uh, Dwight's been my guy.  Okay?
So you keep this made up position? It's important to you?
Did Michael just let anybody in his office?
Oh, uh, Pam? Hey everyone, lunch is on me today.
You know, you can run this stuff by Toby.
Okay, Michael handed in his 2-week notice, did you also hand in your 2-week?
Okay, let me know if you find it.
Because you have embarrassed me for the last time today.  Got it?
That's very kind of you to say, David.
Michael, I'm going to stay for the day.
I don't know what to tell you. The job's been taken.
Just want to fill you in on a few details. As you know, I will be running the branch while we search for Michael's replacement. So please feel free to come to me with any questions or concerns. [Kelly raises hand] Yeah.
Thank you, Michael. Thank you for the C-shaped bagels.
I'll tell David what he needs to know. Sorry. David wants it this way.
Okay, I'm gonna call you Kapoor, okay? And you, Hannon.
Yeah, I don't think we can let you play with that foot.
Oh, my God! Oh wow. Jim, what the?
What do you say, Jim? Huh? Wanna play some soccer?
Everyone, except for Michael, go back to your desks.
Okay, great.  Uh, Dwight come on in.  Also, Jim.
So, we had a personnel change today.  Shouldn't effect our day to day.  But, until we get a new receptionist I want Kevin on the phones.
Okay. See you on the field, there, bro.
Yes.  Yes, I was gonna say the same thing.  We should buy him out.
Oh yeah, take your time.  Stanley, pay attention.
For regional manager I've decided to go with an outside hire.  For obvious reasons.
Right. I mean why work harder than you should.
Aw, man, I can't wait to play with you.
Yeah, I mean, come on. This is a work place. It isn't designed for your vanity.
Yeah, I like your work ethic. You're so... focused.
No, no, not salaries. Petty cash, supplies, and uh, you know, parties.
But the goal is to, you know, fight our way through this.
There he is. There he is.  How was the trip up?
Hey, did anyone see the client list that Michael was supposed to be working on.
I feel like I should be thanking you.
You started on that rundown yet?  [Looks at Jim's screen.]
How about I just say hi to everyone at one time?
And I wanna start givin' you more responsibility. What do you say you and I go out for a drink this week?
I don't know. You know, this is a company picnic, so technically that is a company injury, you know? Safest thing to do is get that examined, right David?
Yeah, I love the sport. I love the sport. Alright, man.
not if you're starting your own paper company, Michael. Hank...
No, it's a little bit more than that. I'm going to set up in here, ok?
I don't want to hear excuses.  I want to see improvements.  This is unacceptable.
I was actually in Germany for the 2006 World Cup Finals.
In the last month we have lost ten major clients to Michael Scott.
