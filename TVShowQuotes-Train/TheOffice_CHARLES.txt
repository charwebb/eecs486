He shows promise and Jim, I don't know-- I-- he's been a disappointment.
Erin. Okay, that's very pretty.
He did.
What do you say, Jim? Huh? Wanna play some soccer?
No.
[on cell phone] Charles Miner. Hello? Hello, who is this? Who is this?
That's not how I plan on doing things.
No, it's a little bit more than that. I'm going to set up in here, ok?
Woah, woah, woah, woah, you wanna get that looked at.
Also, there has been too much wasted time.  So Stanley.
It's no big deal.
Yeah, I mean, come on. This is a work place. It isn't designed for your vanity.
Hey.
You started on that rundown yet?  [Looks at Jim's screen.]
Looking good.
You didn't tell them.
Yeah, would you, uh?
Hey Hank, You ready?
Hey, Oscar, it's good to meet you.
...sees his partner -
Ok.
Dwight.
Uh, I need you to go over this client list and indicate any wrong or false data.
Jim.
Hey Pam.
[Charles comes from around corner] Hi, Michael.
Halpert. He looks up!
I agree.
That's great.
Hey, guys--
But the goal is to, you know, fight our way through this.
Definitely.
Hey, I come from accounting, too.
Oh, okay.
what are you doing?
Yeah.
Okay, Jim Halpert. I need your eyes up front.
Okay, great.
That's very kind of you to say, David.
[Dwight, Jim and Pam leave] Thank you very much.
This isn't a good use of company time, Michael.
Everyone, except for Michael, go back to your desks.
Oh yeah, take your time.  Stanley, pay attention.
Oh yeah?
Nice day, huh?
Did Michael just let anybody in his office?
Oh, my God! Oh wow. Jim, what the?
Actually, I meant questions more about the day-to-day operations of the company. Kay. [Andy raises hand] Yeah.
Yeah.
I do this for every branch I go to. If you do not like it, then I think there are some bagels left over from this morning.
Phyllis, are you okay? Are, you okay?
Jim. Pam.
They don't make them anymore.
Yeah?
In the last month we have lost ten major clients to Michael Scott.
And I wanna start givin' you more responsibility. What do you say you and I go out for a drink this week?
I don't want to hear excuses.  I want to see improvements.  This is unacceptable.
Right. I mean why work harder than you should.
Yeah.
Michael, what are you doing?
Miner - [kicking a piece of trash]
Thank you.
Hank?  No, I don't need Hank Michael.
Hey, you know we're in tough times and we're not immune to this economy.
No, Mich-Michael.
No, they were your client.  They just called and told us they're switching over to Michael Scott Paper Company.
So how long can they stay viable?
I feel like I should be thanking you.
Oh, uh, Pam? Hey everyone, lunch is on me today.
Why are you wearing a tuxedo?
Uh.
Nah, that's weird. You're gonna sit. [Dwight sits] Great. You know, Dwight, it has been quite a transition for all of us. Are you happy with the way things have been runnin' lately?
Michael, no, let's be cool, ok?
Oh, I meant, I meant that Kelly. [New receptionist walks in]
Um.
Okay, great.  Uh, Dwight come on in.  Also, Jim.
Yes.
Okay, I'm gonna call you Kapoor, okay? And you, Hannon.
Yeah, I love the sport. I love the sport. Alright, man.
That's a great idea, Dwight.
What about you, Jim? You a fan of the game?
Michael, you're back.
I was actually in Germany for the 2006 World Cup Finals.
Oh, yeah. Jim's sorry.
I will walk away.
Does that make you feel better? Huh?
Yep. Yep. That's Pele.
I-I was-
Whatcha got, Jim?...  What is a two-way petting zoo?
Yeah, he knows. He just wants a good manager.
Jim. What do you play?
Just want to fill you in on a few details. As you know, I will be running the branch while we search for Michael's replacement. So please feel free to come to me with any questions or concerns. [Kelly raises hand] Yeah.
As soon as possible.
Do I need to?
The conference room is ready if we want to get started.
How old are you?
Ok, Michael, what are you doing?
Okay. See you on the field, there, bro.
Hey Kelly?
I don't know if I have hurt your feelings or you do not disagree with my methods, but it is over.
You still have that option. [Michael sighs]
Good. As I was saying...
No, I worked at a company called Saticoy Steel.
Oh, you know it hasn't been that bad.  Hasn't been that bad.  These people are the salt of the earth down here.  You couldn't ask for a better way to learn a company.
You two are morons.
Ok.
Oh, I didn't know that position existed.
You know, you can run this stuff by Toby.
So, we had a personnel change today.  Shouldn't effect our day to day.  But, until we get a new receptionist I want Kevin on the phones.
Okay.
Aw, man, I can't wait to play with you.
Okay.
Right.
Yes we are!
I've just been impressed with your performance and I wanted to make sure good work doesn't go unnoticed.
Get out.
I guess that's it for you, Jim.
Five years old?
Just keep it simple.
Yeah, I will. What I told Michael last week-
Yeah, I don't think we can let you play with that foot.
No, no, not salaries. Petty cash, supplies, and uh, you know, parties.
No, Jim... I think you should go.
I didn't know we had so many, uh, soccer fans in the office.
So you keep this made up position? It's important to you?
I know. Yes I do.
Yeah, Jim--
Michael, I'm going to stay for the day.
Forward or half?
God, no.
Eh, uh, in a hotel.
For regional manager I've decided to go with an outside hire.  For obvious reasons.
Okay, Michael?
Defending duo! He sets him up! [Jim moves the piece of trash with his hands] He sets him up. Yeah. Oh-ho!
Look who just woke up! [laughs, scores a point on the next play] I've been up for a while.
No, seriously.
What?  How'd you hear that?
No.
You a soccer fan?
And what is that?
Why'd you duck, Jim?
Mmmhmm.
[Jim knocks on door] Come in.
Thank you, Michael. Thank you for the C-shaped bagels.
Yeah I know.
I don't know what to tell you. The job's been taken.
Great. Fax that to everyone on the distribution list.
That's not the way it's gonna work.
Uh, well said, Angela.
Excuse me, guys. What's going on in here?
You know, Michael, I don't need to know everyone's sexual history.
Michael get up!
Sp-Well, um, Michael should have filled you in last week.
Your name is Jim?
I am aware of the effect I have on woman.
No. Hey, hey. I just want to hear 'yes'.
Because you have embarrassed me for the last time today.  Got it?
Oh.
Dwight, take a seat.
Okay.
Okay, do  not go anywhere near the conference room.
Uh, hold on, Michael, thank you. Uh, Stanley, you know, we can't make any promises, but we'll try everything in our power to avoid that.
Yes.  Yes, I was gonna say the same thing.  We should buy him out.
What exactly is the PPC?
Michael, I want you to stop pestering my salesmen, and I want you to leave Dunder Mifflin alone. Do you understand?
Ok, so we're on the same page, great.
I don't know. You know, this is a company picnic, so technically that is a company injury, you know? Safest thing to do is get that examined, right David?
Let's see what you got in those legs!
I can't pretend I haven't seen that.  So I am going e to ask you to stand up, walk  out. And you can't take anything.
All right! Come on.
Is this something you really want to have said?
Well, that makes two of us.
What?
Just get it right.
Any responsibilities come with it?
Uh, no, sorry, Michael. No, Kevin, right? We're going to need you to do that during office hours.
Saticoy Steel.
Is that we are cutting three percent across the board, which means we will no longer be matching 401k contributions. All overtime requests will need to come through the corporate office.
You're working hard? On this?
Come in...
not if you're starting your own paper company, Michael. Hank...
Ok, Michael, I'm dissolving this committee.
Okay.  After you.
Okay.  Hey, Dwight.  Can I talk to you?
See you on the field. Ha, ha. I can't wait!
C'mon, Oscar. What positions do people play?
Uh, Jim hold on. [whispers] You know, David, uh, Dwight's been my guy.  Okay?
We still have the inventory sitting-- [everyone starts chattering at once]
Well, it's not for everybody I suppose. [Andy laughs]
What is wrong with you?
Yeah, I want you to be on top of that okay?  I want you to be my productivity czar. Okay, good.  Uh, okay that it on my list. So uh, you know, no excuses guys. Lets get going okay? [everyone leaves except Kevin and Stanley, who are sitting stunned in their chairs]
Must be nice to get a rest from all your rest. [walks away]
No.
Okay, Michael handed in his 2-week notice, did you also hand in your 2-week?
Why are you telling me this?
Yeah, it looks like Pam won't make it back. Okay?
Alright. [Dwight blows whistle in Jim's face] No, no, no. That's supposed to be the kickoff.
Hey Jim can I get a, um-
