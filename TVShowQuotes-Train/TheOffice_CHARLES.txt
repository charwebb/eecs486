Oh, yeah. Jim's sorry.
Your name is Jim?
Uh, hold on, Michael, thank you. Uh, Stanley, you know, we can't make any promises, but we'll try everything in our power to avoid that.
Well, that makes two of us.
Is that we are cutting three percent across the board, which means we will no longer be matching 401k contributions. All overtime requests will need to come through the corporate office.
I don't know what to tell you. The job's been taken.
He shows promise and Jim, I don't know-- I-- he's been a disappointment.
I am aware of the effect I have on woman.
Does that make you feel better? Huh?
No, no no no.  You're done, Michael.
Michael, I'm going to stay for the day.
Yeah, I want you to be on top of that okay?  I want you to be my productivity czar. Okay, good.  Uh, okay that it on my list. So uh, you know, no excuses guys. Lets get going okay? [everyone leaves except Kevin and Stanley, who are sitting stunned in their chairs]
Dwight.
Is this something you really want to have said?
Ok, Michael, I'm dissolving this committee.
Michael, you're back.
No, Jim... I think you should go.
Yeah, I mean, come on. This is a work place. It isn't designed for your vanity.
Eh, uh, in a hotel.
That's not how I plan on doing things.
Oh.
Okay.  Hey, Dwight.  Can I talk to you?
Okay, great.
Why are you telling me this?
I know. Yes I do.
Hey, guys--
For regional manager I've decided to go with an outside hire.  For obvious reasons.
Thank you, Michael. Thank you for the C-shaped bagels.
How old are you?
Yes.
Must be nice to get a rest from all your rest. [walks away]
...sees his partner -
Look who just woke up! [laughs, scores a point on the next play] I've been up for a while.
We need to talk about our two companies, and how we should behave. Dwight tells me you've been pestering him for company info.
Hey.
I've just been impressed with your performance and I wanted to make sure good work doesn't go unnoticed.
Saticoy Steel.
Thank you.
Oh, uh, Pam? Hey everyone, lunch is on me today.
All right! Come on.
I don't know what to do to inspire these people. Okay, maybe it's my fault-
Yeah, it looks like Pam won't make it back. Okay?
It's no big deal.
Hey Hank, You ready?
I'll tell David what he needs to know. Sorry. David wants it this way.
Uh.
Yep. Yep. That's Pele.
Okay, do  not go anywhere near the conference room.
Nah, that's weird. You're gonna sit. [Dwight sits] Great. You know, Dwight, it has been quite a transition for all of us. Are you happy with the way things have been runnin' lately?
That's not the way it's gonna work.
Because you have embarrassed me for the last time today.  Got it?
No.
Hank?  No, I don't need Hank Michael.
Whatcha got, Jim?...  What is a two-way petting zoo?
As soon as possible.
Dwight, take a seat.
Oh, I didn't know that position existed.
Hey, you know we're in tough times and we're not immune to this economy.
You started on that rundown yet?  [Looks at Jim's screen.]
Nice day, huh?
Yeah, I don't think we can let you play with that foot.
We still have the inventory sitting-- [everyone starts chattering at once]
But the goal is to, you know, fight our way through this.
Well, it's not for everybody I suppose. [Andy laughs]
Oh yeah?
Looking good.
Michael, I want you to stop pestering my salesmen, and I want you to leave Dunder Mifflin alone. Do you understand?
I will walk away.
You a soccer fan?
Okay.
Yeah.
You know, Michael, I don't need to know everyone's sexual history.
So how long can they stay viable?
I don't know. You know, this is a company picnic, so technically that is a company injury, you know? Safest thing to do is get that examined, right David?
Why'd you duck, Jim?
What exactly is the PPC?
In the last month we have lost ten major clients to Michael Scott.
You know, you can run this stuff by Toby.
No, it's a little bit more than that. I'm going to set up in here, ok?
No, they were your client.  They just called and told us they're switching over to Michael Scott Paper Company.
Defending duo! He sets him up! [Jim moves the piece of trash with his hands] He sets him up. Yeah. Oh-ho!
I agree.
Oh, I meant, I meant that Kelly. [New receptionist walks in]
So you keep this made up position? It's important to you?
Okay.  After you.
You didn't tell them.
Yeah, he knows. He just wants a good manager.
Michael, no, let's be cool, ok?
Michael, what are you doing?
Right. I mean why work harder than you should.
Hi. I need a rundown of your clients, can you get that to me.
C'mon, Oscar. What positions do people play?
The conference room is ready if we want to get started.
Just want to fill you in on a few details. As you know, I will be running the branch while we search for Michael's replacement. So please feel free to come to me with any questions or concerns. [Kelly raises hand] Yeah.
[on cell phone] Charles Miner. Hello? Hello, who is this? Who is this?
Good. As I was saying...
Oh, and Kelly...
They don't make them anymore.
Sp-Well, um, Michael should have filled you in last week.
Woah, woah, woah, woah, you wanna get that looked at.
Great. Fax that to everyone on the distribution list.
How about I just say hi to everyone at one time?
You're working hard? On this?
See you on the field. Ha, ha. I can't wait!
What?
Uh, no, sorry, Michael. No, Kevin, right? We're going to need you to do that during office hours.
Yeah, I like your work ethic. You're so... focused.
Okay, Michael handed in his 2-week notice, did you also hand in your 2-week?
No.
Oh, you know it hasn't been that bad.  Hasn't been that bad.  These people are the salt of the earth down here.  You couldn't ask for a better way to learn a company.
[Jim knocks on door] Come in.
Ok, so we're on the same page, great.
Get out.
Yeah.
Oh yeah, take your time.  Stanley, pay attention.
Halpert. He looks up!
Okay.
not if you're starting your own paper company, Michael. Hank...
Everyone, except for Michael, go back to your desks.
Okay, I'm gonna call you Kapoor, okay? And you, Hannon.
What?  How'd you hear that?
Ok.
No. Hey, hey. I just want to hear 'yes'.
I guess that's it for you, Jim.
Okay, who covers Bans Pet Grooming?
Come in...
Why are you wearing a tuxedo?
Oh, my God! Oh wow. Jim, what the?
Yeah?
Just keep it simple.
So you're the assistant to the regional manager?
what are you doing?
Also, there has been too much wasted time.  So Stanley.
Yeah.
Hey, I come from accounting, too.
Yes we are!
[Charles comes from around corner] Hi, Michael.
Right.
He did.
Yeah, I love the sport. I love the sport. Alright, man.
Alright. [Dwight blows whistle in Jim's face] No, no, no. That's supposed to be the kickoff.
And I wanna start givin' you more responsibility. What do you say you and I go out for a drink this week?
That's a great idea, Dwight.
So, we had a personnel change today.  Shouldn't effect our day to day.  But, until we get a new receptionist I want Kevin on the phones.
Excuse me, guys. What's going on in here?
Hey, did anyone see the client list that Michael was supposed to be working on.
Uh, I need you to go over this client list and indicate any wrong or false data.
Yeah, would you, uh?
You two are morons.
No, seriously.
Ok. Nice meeting everyone. I'll see you in a couple of weeks.
Okay, let's go over non-discretionary cuts. Okay, guys? [Charles sees Stanley with his crossword, Charles stares and he puts it away] Thank you. So, umm...
Yeah, I will. What I told Michael last week-
Hey, Oscar, it's good to meet you.
Yeah I know.
No, Mich-Michael.
It is official. It is official. And actually, guys, I'm encouraging branches to consider a freeze on discretionary spending.
Michael get up!
Definitely.
No, it is not.
Okay, let me know if you find it.
Okay.
That's very kind of you to say, David.
Okay, Michael?
Okay, great.  Uh, Dwight come on in.  Also, Jim.
This isn't a good use of company time, Michael.
No.
Jim. Pam.
I do this for every branch I go to. If you do not like it, then I think there are some bagels left over from this morning.
Oh, okay.
Um.
That's great.
What is wrong with you?
Erin. Okay, that's very pretty.
Okay. See you on the field, there, bro.
Uh, well said, Angela.
I-I was-
What do you say, Jim? Huh? Wanna play some soccer?
Mmmhmm.
Did Michael just let anybody in his office?
Uh, Jim hold on. [whispers] You know, David, uh, Dwight's been my guy.  Okay?
Jim.
What's that?
Hey Jim can I get a, um-
I wrote a memo to all departments asking them to find ways to save money but, uh--
I was actually in Germany for the 2006 World Cup Finals.
You still have that option. [Michael sighs]
Just get it right.
[Dwight, Jim and Pam leave] Thank you very much.
I don't know if I have hurt your feelings or you do not disagree with my methods, but it is over.
God, no.
Aw, man, I can't wait to play with you.
Any responsibilities come with it?
Number two?
Yes.  Yes, I was gonna say the same thing.  We should buy him out.
Jim. What do you play?
Hey Kelly?
I don't want to hear excuses.  I want to see improvements.  This is unacceptable.
