Okay, who covers Bans Pet Grooming?
Uh, hold on, Michael, thank you. Uh, Stanley, you know, we can't make any promises, but we'll try everything in our power to avoid that.
No, no no no.  You're done, Michael.
He did.
Ok, Michael, I'm dissolving this committee.
Uh.
God, no.
Does that make you feel better? Huh?
Okay.
Sp-Well, um, Michael should have filled you in last week.
I guess that's it for you, Jim.
Yeah.
Forward or half?
...sees his partner -
Hey Kelly?
Excuse me, guys. What's going on in here?
Why are you wearing a tuxedo?
Yes.
Eh, uh, in a hotel.
Oh, yeah. Jim's sorry.
I will walk away.
Okay. See you on the field, there, bro.
The conference room is ready if we want to get started.
I am aware of the effect I have on woman.
Hey Hank, You ready?
It is official. It is official. And actually, guys, I'm encouraging branches to consider a freeze on discretionary spending.
As soon as possible.
Ok.
Yeah, would you, uh?
No, seriously.
Why'd you duck, Jim?
What about you, Jim? You a fan of the game?
Oh, you know it hasn't been that bad.  Hasn't been that bad.  These people are the salt of the earth down here.  You couldn't ask for a better way to learn a company.
No, Jim... I think you should go.
Okay.  After you.
They don't make them anymore.
Woah, woah, woah, woah, you wanna get that looked at.
Okay, let's go over non-discretionary cuts. Okay, guys? [Charles sees Stanley with his crossword, Charles stares and he puts it away] Thank you. So, umm...
That's not the way it's gonna work.
Uh, well said, Angela.
I know. Yes I do.
I can't pretend I haven't seen that.  So I am going e to ask you to stand up, walk  out. And you can't take anything.
Well, it's not for everybody I suppose. [Andy laughs]
Yeah.
Also, there has been too much wasted time.  So Stanley.
Oh, I didn't know that position existed.
Everyone, except for Michael, go back to your desks.
So you keep this made up position? It's important to you?
I do this for every branch I go to. If you do not like it, then I think there are some bagels left over from this morning.
I don't know what to do to inspire these people. Okay, maybe it's my fault-
No, no, not salaries. Petty cash, supplies, and uh, you know, parties.
Oh, okay.
not if you're starting your own paper company, Michael. Hank...
Saticoy Steel.
I feel like I should be thanking you.
This doesn't seem like a good way to spend company time.
Hey, Oscar, it's good to meet you.
How old are you?
Good. As I was saying...
Great. Fax that to everyone on the distribution list.
Okay, Michael?
Okay, do  not go anywhere near the conference room.
For regional manager I've decided to go with an outside hire.  For obvious reasons.
Just get it right.
Yes.  Yes, I was gonna say the same thing.  We should buy him out.
Michael, what are you doing?
Come in...
No.
Right.
Nah, that's weird. You're gonna sit. [Dwight sits] Great. You know, Dwight, it has been quite a transition for all of us. Are you happy with the way things have been runnin' lately?
You know, you can run this stuff by Toby.
Oh, Jim, you're putting a volleyball game in front of your fiance's health.
Ok.
Is this something you really want to have said?
Oh, I meant, I meant that Kelly. [New receptionist walks in]
That's not how I plan on doing things.
Miner - [kicking a piece of trash]
Look who just woke up! [laughs, scores a point on the next play] I've been up for a while.
So, we had a personnel change today.  Shouldn't effect our day to day.  But, until we get a new receptionist I want Kevin on the phones.
No, it is not.
And I wanna start givin' you more responsibility. What do you say you and I go out for a drink this week?
Did Michael just let anybody in his office?
We need to talk about our two companies, and how we should behave. Dwight tells me you've been pestering him for company info.
Erin. Okay, that's very pretty.
Okay, let me know if you find it.
See you on the field. Ha, ha. I can't wait!
Oh.
I-I was-
And what is that?
Any responsibilities come with it?
Aw, man, I can't wait to play with you.
Is that we are cutting three percent across the board, which means we will no longer be matching 401k contributions. All overtime requests will need to come through the corporate office.
Jim. What do you play?
Dwight.
What?
So you're the assistant to the regional manager?
I don't know if I have hurt your feelings or you do not disagree with my methods, but it is over.
But the goal is to, you know, fight our way through this.
Alright. [Dwight blows whistle in Jim's face] No, no, no. That's supposed to be the kickoff.
It's no big deal.
Hey, I come from accounting, too.
Well, that makes two of us.
No, they were your client.  They just called and told us they're switching over to Michael Scott Paper Company.
[Jim knocks on door] Come in.
I've just been impressed with your performance and I wanted to make sure good work doesn't go unnoticed.
Hey, did anyone see the client list that Michael was supposed to be working on.
He shows promise and Jim, I don't know-- I-- he's been a disappointment.
Nice day, huh?
No.
Thank you, Michael. Thank you for the C-shaped bagels.
Uh, no, sorry, Michael. No, Kevin, right? We're going to need you to do that during office hours.
Hey.
Hey Jim can I get a, um-
You know, Michael, I don't need to know everyone's sexual history.
Halpert. He looks up!
Yeah, I want you to be on top of that okay?  I want you to be my productivity czar. Okay, good.  Uh, okay that it on my list. So uh, you know, no excuses guys. Lets get going okay? [everyone leaves except Kevin and Stanley, who are sitting stunned in their chairs]
[Dwight, Jim and Pam leave] Thank you very much.
There he is. There he is.  How was the trip up?
What?  How'd you hear that?
Get out.
That's great.
Oh, uh, Pam? Hey everyone, lunch is on me today.
I don't know. You know, this is a company picnic, so technically that is a company injury, you know? Safest thing to do is get that examined, right David?
Definitely.
Must be nice to get a rest from all your rest. [walks away]
Okay, Michael handed in his 2-week notice, did you also hand in your 2-week?
Yeah, he knows. He just wants a good manager.
Ok. Nice meeting everyone. I'll see you in a couple of weeks.
Michael get up!
All right! Come on.
I don't want to hear excuses.  I want to see improvements.  This is unacceptable.
Oh, and Kelly...
Ok, so we're on the same page, great.
what are you doing?
You're working hard? On this?
I wrote a memo to all departments asking them to find ways to save money but, uh--
Hey, guys--
Why are you telling me this?
Oh yeah?
Uh, Jim hold on. [whispers] You know, David, uh, Dwight's been my guy.  Okay?
I didn't know we had so many, uh, soccer fans in the office.
Dwight, take a seat.
Yeah, Jim--
Just want to fill you in on a few details. As you know, I will be running the branch while we search for Michael's replacement. So please feel free to come to me with any questions or concerns. [Kelly raises hand] Yeah.
Oh yeah, take your time.  Stanley, pay attention.
Yes we are!
Actually, I meant questions more about the day-to-day operations of the company. Kay. [Andy raises hand] Yeah.
Michael, you're back.
Yep. Yep. That's Pele.
You still have that option. [Michael sighs]
Whatcha got, Jim?...  What is a two-way petting zoo?
Hank?  No, I don't need Hank Michael.
Um.
That's very kind of you to say, David.
What exactly is the PPC?
Number two?
Yeah, I love the sport. I love the sport. Alright, man.
Oh, my God! Oh wow. Jim, what the?
No, it's a little bit more than that. I'm going to set up in here, ok?
This isn't a good use of company time, Michael.
I'll tell David what he needs to know. Sorry. David wants it this way.
C'mon, Oscar. What positions do people play?
You didn't tell them.
What is wrong with you?
Yeah, I like your work ethic. You're so... focused.
Your name is Jim?
[Charles comes from around corner] Hi, Michael.
Okay, I'm gonna call you Kapoor, okay? And you, Hannon.
Right. I mean why work harder than you should.
Michael, I'm going to stay for the day.
Yeah I know.
What's that?
Thank you.
No. Hey, hey. I just want to hear 'yes'.
Jim. Pam.
Defending duo! He sets him up! [Jim moves the piece of trash with his hands] He sets him up. Yeah. Oh-ho!
Mmmhmm.
How about I just say hi to everyone at one time?
Looking good.
You a soccer fan?
No, I worked at a company called Saticoy Steel.
Ok, Michael, what are you doing?
Hey, you know we're in tough times and we're not immune to this economy.
Uh, I need you to go over this client list and indicate any wrong or false data.
Just keep it simple.
Yeah?
Five years old?
So how long can they stay viable?
I don't know what to tell you. The job's been taken.
I was actually in Germany for the 2006 World Cup Finals.
No, Mich-Michael.
Michael, no, let's be cool, ok?
[on cell phone] Charles Miner. Hello? Hello, who is this? Who is this?
That's a great idea, Dwight.
Let's see what you got in those legs!
I agree.
You two are morons.
Okay, great.  Uh, Dwight come on in.  Also, Jim.
