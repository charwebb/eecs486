Okay, Jim Halpert. I need your eyes up front.
Yeah, I want you to be on top of that okay?  I want you to be my productivity czar. Okay, good.  Uh, okay that it on my list. So uh, you know, no excuses guys. Lets get going okay? [everyone leaves except Kevin and Stanley, who are sitting stunned in their chairs]
Look who just woke up! [laughs, scores a point on the next play] I've been up for a while.
So you're the assistant to the regional manager?
There he is. There he is.  How was the trip up?
But the goal is to, you know, fight our way through this.
Yeah, I like your work ethic. You're so... focused.
No, no, not salaries. Petty cash, supplies, and uh, you know, parties.
Let's see what you got in those legs!
Sp-Well, um, Michael should have filled you in last week.
Defending duo! He sets him up! [Jim moves the piece of trash with his hands] He sets him up. Yeah. Oh-ho!
Yeah, I will. What I told Michael last week-
I don't know. You know, this is a company picnic, so technically that is a company injury, you know? Safest thing to do is get that examined, right David?
In the last month we have lost ten major clients to Michael Scott.
Thank you, Michael. Thank you for the C-shaped bagels.
I don't know what to tell you. The job's been taken.
He shows promise and Jim, I don't know-- I-- he's been a disappointment.
Michael, I want you to stop pestering my salesmen, and I want you to leave Dunder Mifflin alone. Do you understand?
What about you, Jim? You a fan of the game?
Alright. [Dwight blows whistle in Jim's face] No, no, no. That's supposed to be the kickoff.
Hi. I need a rundown of your clients, can you get that to me.
I don't know if I have hurt your feelings or you do not disagree with my methods, but it is over.
Excuse me, guys. What's going on in here?
Hey, you know we're in tough times and we're not immune to this economy.
Yeah, I don't think we can let you play with that foot.
That's very kind of you to say, David.
I don't want to hear excuses.  I want to see improvements.  This is unacceptable.
Okay, let me know if you find it.
We need to talk about our two companies, and how we should behave. Dwight tells me you've been pestering him for company info.
Uh, Jim hold on. [whispers] You know, David, uh, Dwight's been my guy.  Okay?
How about I just say hi to everyone at one time?
Is that we are cutting three percent across the board, which means we will no longer be matching 401k contributions. All overtime requests will need to come through the corporate office.
No, they were your client.  They just called and told us they're switching over to Michael Scott Paper Company.
Great. Fax that to everyone on the distribution list.
Yeah, he knows. He just wants a good manager.
[Dwight, Jim and Pam leave] Thank you very much.
Everyone, except for Michael, go back to your desks.
What do you say, Jim? Huh? Wanna play some soccer?
Ok. Nice meeting everyone. I'll see you in a couple of weeks.
No. Hey, hey. I just want to hear 'yes'.
Yes.  Yes, I was gonna say the same thing.  We should buy him out.
Uh, hold on, Michael, thank you. Uh, Stanley, you know, we can't make any promises, but we'll try everything in our power to avoid that.
Yeah, it looks like Pam won't make it back. Okay?
So you keep this made up position? It's important to you?
Oh, my God! Oh wow. Jim, what the?
not if you're starting your own paper company, Michael. Hank...
That's not how I plan on doing things.
I've just been impressed with your performance and I wanted to make sure good work doesn't go unnoticed.
Yeah, I'm Charles Miner, here to see Michael Scott.
Ok, so we're on the same page, great.
Okay, great.  Uh, Dwight come on in.  Also, Jim.
Okay. See you on the field, there, bro.
Whatcha got, Jim?...  What is a two-way petting zoo?
I was actually in Germany for the 2006 World Cup Finals.
Actually, I meant questions more about the day-to-day operations of the company. Kay. [Andy raises hand] Yeah.
Because you have embarrassed me for the last time today.  Got it?
Okay, I'm gonna call you Kapoor, okay? And you, Hannon.
Okay, let's go over non-discretionary cuts. Okay, guys? [Charles sees Stanley with his crossword, Charles stares and he puts it away] Thank you. So, umm...
I feel like I should be thanking you.
See you on the field. Ha, ha. I can't wait!
Uh, no, sorry, Michael. No, Kevin, right? We're going to need you to do that during office hours.
Just want to fill you in on a few details. As you know, I will be running the branch while we search for Michael's replacement. So please feel free to come to me with any questions or concerns. [Kelly raises hand] Yeah.
Oh, Jim, you're putting a volleyball game in front of your fiance's health.
Yeah, I mean, come on. This is a work place. It isn't designed for your vanity.
Well, it's not for everybody I suppose. [Andy laughs]
Okay, do  not go anywhere near the conference room.
I am aware of the effect I have on woman.
For regional manager I've decided to go with an outside hire.  For obvious reasons.
We still have the inventory sitting-- [everyone starts chattering at once]
Aw, man, I can't wait to play with you.
This doesn't seem like a good way to spend company time.
Is this something you really want to have said?
I do this for every branch I go to. If you do not like it, then I think there are some bagels left over from this morning.
You know, you can run this stuff by Toby.
Woah, woah, woah, woah, you wanna get that looked at.
And I wanna start givin' you more responsibility. What do you say you and I go out for a drink this week?
I didn't know we had so many, uh, soccer fans in the office.
Did Michael just let anybody in his office?
I wrote a memo to all departments asking them to find ways to save money but, uh--
I don't know what to do to inspire these people. Okay, maybe it's my fault-
Hey, did anyone see the client list that Michael was supposed to be working on.
Okay, Michael handed in his 2-week notice, did you also hand in your 2-week?
Oh, I meant, I meant that Kelly. [New receptionist walks in]
You started on that rundown yet?  [Looks at Jim's screen.]
Also, there has been too much wasted time.  So Stanley.
Nah, that's weird. You're gonna sit. [Dwight sits] Great. You know, Dwight, it has been quite a transition for all of us. Are you happy with the way things have been runnin' lately?
You know, Michael, I don't need to know everyone's sexual history.
Oh, you know it hasn't been that bad.  Hasn't been that bad.  These people are the salt of the earth down here.  You couldn't ask for a better way to learn a company.
Right. I mean why work harder than you should.
No, it's a little bit more than that. I'm going to set up in here, ok?
Yeah, I love the sport. I love the sport. Alright, man.
This isn't a good use of company time, Michael.
[on cell phone] Charles Miner. Hello? Hello, who is this? Who is this?
Michael, I'm going to stay for the day.
I'll tell David what he needs to know. Sorry. David wants it this way.
