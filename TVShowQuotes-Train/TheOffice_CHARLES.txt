Oh, my God! Oh wow. Jim, what the?
See you on the field. Ha, ha. I can't wait!
I didn't know we had so many, uh, soccer fans in the office.
Okay, I'm gonna call you Kapoor, okay? And you, Hannon.
Oh, you know it hasn't been that bad.  Hasn't been that bad.  These people are the salt of the earth down here.  You couldn't ask for a better way to learn a company.
Oh yeah, take your time.  Stanley, pay attention.
It is official. It is official. And actually, guys, I'm encouraging branches to consider a freeze on discretionary spending.
Hi. I need a rundown of your clients, can you get that to me.
I was actually in Germany for the 2006 World Cup Finals.
We need to talk about our two companies, and how we should behave. Dwight tells me you've been pestering him for company info.
Let's see what you got in those legs!
Oh, I meant, I meant that Kelly. [New receptionist walks in]
Also, there has been too much wasted time.  So Stanley.
How about I just say hi to everyone at one time?
[Dwight, Jim and Pam leave] Thank you very much.
In the last month we have lost ten major clients to Michael Scott.
Uh, no, sorry, Michael. No, Kevin, right? We're going to need you to do that during office hours.
Is that we are cutting three percent across the board, which means we will no longer be matching 401k contributions. All overtime requests will need to come through the corporate office.
I don't want to hear excuses.  I want to see improvements.  This is unacceptable.
Okay.  Hey, Dwight.  Can I talk to you?
We still have the inventory sitting-- [everyone starts chattering at once]
Okay, Jim Halpert. I need your eyes up front.
I do this for every branch I go to. If you do not like it, then I think there are some bagels left over from this morning.
Yeah, he knows. He just wants a good manager.
Just want to fill you in on a few details. As you know, I will be running the branch while we search for Michael's replacement. So please feel free to come to me with any questions or concerns. [Kelly raises hand] Yeah.
No, no, not salaries. Petty cash, supplies, and uh, you know, parties.
Uh, I need you to go over this client list and indicate any wrong or false data.
Yeah, I want you to be on top of that okay?  I want you to be my productivity czar. Okay, good.  Uh, okay that it on my list. So uh, you know, no excuses guys. Lets get going okay? [everyone leaves except Kevin and Stanley, who are sitting stunned in their chairs]
Well, it's not for everybody I suppose. [Andy laughs]
He shows promise and Jim, I don't know-- I-- he's been a disappointment.
No, I worked at a company called Saticoy Steel.
Yeah, I'm Charles Miner, here to see Michael Scott.
Yeah, I mean, come on. This is a work place. It isn't designed for your vanity.
Hey, did anyone see the client list that Michael was supposed to be working on.
You started on that rundown yet?  [Looks at Jim's screen.]
You know, Michael, I don't need to know everyone's sexual history.
That's not how I plan on doing things.
Excuse me, guys. What's going on in here?
I wrote a memo to all departments asking them to find ways to save money but, uh--
Ok, so we're on the same page, great.
That's very kind of you to say, David.
Okay, Michael handed in his 2-week notice, did you also hand in your 2-week?
What do you say, Jim? Huh? Wanna play some soccer?
This doesn't seem like a good way to spend company time.
Okay. See you on the field, there, bro.
Actually, I meant questions more about the day-to-day operations of the company. Kay. [Andy raises hand] Yeah.
Is this something you really want to have said?
I've just been impressed with your performance and I wanted to make sure good work doesn't go unnoticed.
Everyone, except for Michael, go back to your desks.
Sp-Well, um, Michael should have filled you in last week.
So you keep this made up position? It's important to you?
Whatcha got, Jim?...  What is a two-way petting zoo?
Oh, Jim, you're putting a volleyball game in front of your fiance's health.
I don't know what to tell you. The job's been taken.
Alright. [Dwight blows whistle in Jim's face] No, no, no. That's supposed to be the kickoff.
No. Hey, hey. I just want to hear 'yes'.
Nah, that's weird. You're gonna sit. [Dwight sits] Great. You know, Dwight, it has been quite a transition for all of us. Are you happy with the way things have been runnin' lately?
Yeah, I don't think we can let you play with that foot.
Great. Fax that to everyone on the distribution list.
So you're the assistant to the regional manager?
I don't know. You know, this is a company picnic, so technically that is a company injury, you know? Safest thing to do is get that examined, right David?
[on cell phone] Charles Miner. Hello? Hello, who is this? Who is this?
Yes.  Yes, I was gonna say the same thing.  We should buy him out.
I don't know if I have hurt your feelings or you do not disagree with my methods, but it is over.
Okay, let me know if you find it.
Oh, uh, Pam? Hey everyone, lunch is on me today.
Okay, great.  Uh, Dwight come on in.  Also, Jim.
No, it's a little bit more than that. I'm going to set up in here, ok?
Did Michael just let anybody in his office?
You know, you can run this stuff by Toby.
Right. I mean why work harder than you should.
Yeah, it looks like Pam won't make it back. Okay?
Michael, I want you to stop pestering my salesmen, and I want you to leave Dunder Mifflin alone. Do you understand?
Uh, Jim hold on. [whispers] You know, David, uh, Dwight's been my guy.  Okay?
This isn't a good use of company time, Michael.
I can't pretend I haven't seen that.  So I am going e to ask you to stand up, walk  out. And you can't take anything.
No, they were your client.  They just called and told us they're switching over to Michael Scott Paper Company.
Woah, woah, woah, woah, you wanna get that looked at.
Hey, you know we're in tough times and we're not immune to this economy.
I don't know what to do to inspire these people. Okay, maybe it's my fault-
Okay, do  not go anywhere near the conference room.
The conference room is ready if we want to get started.
And I wanna start givin' you more responsibility. What do you say you and I go out for a drink this week?
Defending duo! He sets him up! [Jim moves the piece of trash with his hands] He sets him up. Yeah. Oh-ho!
Yeah, I like your work ethic. You're so... focused.
There he is. There he is.  How was the trip up?
Uh, hold on, Michael, thank you. Uh, Stanley, you know, we can't make any promises, but we'll try everything in our power to avoid that.
For regional manager I've decided to go with an outside hire.  For obvious reasons.
What about you, Jim? You a fan of the game?
Thank you, Michael. Thank you for the C-shaped bagels.
Yeah, I will. What I told Michael last week-
Michael, I'm going to stay for the day.
Aw, man, I can't wait to play with you.
not if you're starting your own paper company, Michael. Hank...
I feel like I should be thanking you.
