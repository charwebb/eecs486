And, Kramer, you did provide a service in exchange for compensation. But, does the fee, once paid, not entitle the buyer to some assurance Of reliability? Hmm? Huh? Ahh. These were not easy questions to answer. Not for any man...
Mmm. You present an interesting dilemma. Each of you seemingly has a legitimate claim to the bicycle, and yet the bicycle can have only one rightful owner. Quite the conundrum. As a federal employee, I believe the law is all we have. (getting worked up) It's all that separates us from the savages who don't deserve even the privilege of the daily mail. (angry) Stuffing parcels into mailboxes where they don't belong!!...
A second later, something happened that changed us in a deep and profound way front that day forward.
We gotta find that rickshaw. You check the sewers and dumpsters. I'll hit the soup kitchens, bakeries, and smorgasbords.
Jerry! What could she possibly see in Jerry? (Walks in front of Kramer and trips over his feet.)
I took over his route. And boy, were there a lot of dogs on that route.
All right, it's true! Of course nobody needs mail. What do you think, you're so clever for figuring that out? But you don't know the half of what goes on here. So just walk away, Kramer. I beg of you.
No. I need a really pretty face. But, Hey, that's me.
Well, it's-it's interesting work, I don't mind it.
June 14th, 1987. Mets Phillies. You made a big error. Cost the Mets the game. Then you're coming up the parking lot ramp.
(To his new girlfriend) You see, my dear, all certified mail is registered, but registered mail is not necessarily certified.
All right. Then let me ask you this. Didn't you find it interesting that your friend had the foresight to purchase postal insurance for your stereo. Huh. I mean parcels are rarely damaged during shipping.
[In Kramer's ear] The old coot's sittin' on a mountain of gold!
You wanna know what happened to Kramer? I'll tell you what happened to Kramer. He was ticked off. About the keys. Yeah, that's right - about the keys. Thought he got a bad rap.
Yes. It's called mail fraud. Oohhhh. How I've longed for this moment Seinfeld. The day when I would have the proof I needed to hall you out of your cushy lair and expose to the light of justice as the monster that you are. A monster so vile.....
I usually do. (Gets up to leave) See ya.
(Strangling Kramer) What's the matter with you? We had it all worked out!
No, that's a fur coat! Hey, uh, give me a boost.
...But I have made a decision. (revelatory) We will cut the bike down the middle, and give half to each of you.
How much longer you gonna be, I'm starving here.
Son of Sam. The worst mass murderer the post office ever produced.
Hey, we can't follow him, we're going north to Michigan.
Well, it's her mistake. Because she is going to miss the party of a lifetime.
"Do not bend". (Laughs evilly) Just crease, crumple, cram.. you'll do fine. (Phone rings. Newman answers it) Hello?.. This is he. I don't understand.. very well. (Hangs up in disappointment)
Now, you're that firend. Now, all we need is a reason why you were going to commit suicide.
But, on the week before holidays, we see a surge. On alentine's Day, we send two trucks. On Christmas, four, packed to the brim. And tomorrow, if history is any guide, will see some spillover into a fifth truck.
Oh no. No no no no. I bought it from Kramer. He was hard up for cash. Fifty bucks! (he laughs) Can you believe it? Of course, I had to make some minor modifications, you know. Solid tires, reinforced seatpost, heavy duty shocks. But, baby, this is one sweet ride.
It's the romance of the Handsome Cab without the guilt or dander of the equine.
Then I turned and the spit ricochet of him and it hit me.
Well if you watch closely enough, you just might see me. I'll be the one waving to the camera from my seat on the forty yard line.
It was a cinch. Where are you going?
Elaine's down there causing all kinds of commotion. Somehow she got a hold of his recipes and she says she's gonna drive him out of business! The Soup Nazi said that now that his recipes are out, he's not gonna make anymore soup! He's moving out of the country, moving to Argentina! No more soup, Jerry! No more for of us!
There's no need to get excited. Can't we discuss this like gentlemen?
I went through all those bottles and all those cans, for what? What a waste. And I'm really gonna catch hell for those missing mailbags.
So what? Do you know whose mailbag that is?
(Stands up) Too many people go their mail! Close to 80%. No body from the post office has ever cracked the 50% barrier! It's like the 3-minute mile!
That's good stuff, and you can never have too much ice. Alright, I'll tell you what I'll do. You can co-host the party with me, under one condition. No Jerry. Jerry is not invited.
A banker! A banker! Your Honor, Your Honor, Your Honor...
But you never became a banker, did you Mister Kramer? Why? Why did you fail?
So , you have fleas. Maybe you keep your house in a state of disrepair. Maybe you live in squalor.
You can't taste 'em . Why waste 'em . Why not give them all to me.
(With a gorgeous woman sitting on his lap) Did I?
Well, I'm not paying the five cents for that stupid recycling thing.
The bank. What about your cards and letters?
Twenty bucks?!? Are you out of your mind?
Take it or leave it!? We got *Al Jolson* here, *Al Jolson*!!
Are you married right now? (points at Jerry)
This photo clearly indicates your involvement in some ill-conceived mail order pornography ring.As does this one found in the same disturbing packet.
I wanna learn. I want to know why.
Well, you know how much those records are worth!?
And a slice of pepperoni pizza and a large soda and three times a week I will require a canolie.
And one more thing. I'm not coming to your party. (exits)
I hope you realise what you've done. You've destroyed our whole venture.
Hello Jerry. Well, I may have a solution to our little problem. Elaine, would you excuse us?
What's the matter with you? I just talked to you fifteen minutes ago.
You see, it'd been his lifelong dream to be a banker and he uh, just the day before he was turned down by another bank. I believe it was the Manufacturer's Hanover on Lexington and 40th Street. That was the third bank to turn him down so I was-I was a little concerned. I wanted to see how he was doing. Well, Your Honor, he was barely audible. But I distinctly recall him say...
(reluctant) You don't wanna do your... act, or anything, do you?
You gotta go with me. I mean, you-you're my alibi. You have to take the stand.
Ah, she just didn't do it for me.
Yes, yes. May I go? Cause I gotta go very badly.
Oh well. Let me perfectly blunt. I don't care for you Costanza. You hang out at the west side of the building with Seinfeld all day and just it up wasting your lives.
You gave me a defective detector. ... Jerry?
I just heard that a postman spotted a rickshaw down in Battery Park.
Aaah! Aaagh! Aah-aah. Oh, oh the humanity! Aaagh!
Easy, Jerry. Steady. You wouldn't want to lose your cool at a time like this.
(Stands up and Sputtering loudly) Kramer! I'm with people.
No sir. He did not. But only by thge grace of God. He's in the courtroom today
You heard me. So he packed it up and split for the coast. La-La Land. L.A.
I can't sleep, I tell you! I can't sleep!
June 14, 1987.... Mets Phillies. We're enjoying a beautiful afternoon in the right field stands when a crucial Hernandez error to a five run Phillies ninth. Cost the Mets the game.
Hey, we got ten thousand deposit bottles here. I mean, this guy could be going to Arkansas.
Oh yes, in fact I still have family there. This probably won't interest you, but I have a cousin there who's suffering very badly. She's lost all use of her muscles. She can only communicate by blinking. I would so love to see her - bring a ray of sunshine into her tragic life. But alas, I can't afford it, for I am, as you know, but a simple postal worker.
Maybe we could uh, stop for a snack.
(breaking from his pose) Can I have some gravy?
I dont care much for the beach. I freckle. . . . Is that a,..
Kramer you might as well run along. Jerry might be a while. Suspicion of mail fraud.
Is it?! Ohhh, well if only you'd known, you could have saved some time and given it directly to me! Ha ha ha.
What makes you think I'm lookin' for trouble?
Because the mail never stops. It just keeps coming and coming and coming, there's never a let-up. It's relentless. Every day it piles up more and more and more! And you gotta get it out but the more you get it out the more it keeps coming in. And then the bar code reader breaks and it's *Publisher's Clearing House* day!!!
(pushing past Kramer) Kramer, help me! Help me!
Can't do it. I'm on an unbelievable birthday-wish hot streak! My last five birthday wishes came true.
No, no. I love strong cider. (for the farmer's daughter's benefit) I'm a big, strong, cider guy.
(reluctant) You know, I don't really know that much about uh.. I don't have any.. I don't.. I don't think I know much about that.
I know how you feel. For I, too, have a woman for whom I pine.
Yea, it's the wood that makes it good.
Yes, sir, I believe everything is all squared away. Isn't it, Mr. Kramer?
That guy thought we were a couple of total squares.
I'm not beaten yet. I still have armies in the Ukraine.
Do you really want to know what happened? I'll tell you what Happened. She wasn't my type.
Is this or is this not your signature?
(Kissing the woman) Beauty .. and brains. (they nuzzle noses)
Of course. Take your time. I be here.
Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry.
Look, you said the one in the second courtyard. He was in the second courtyard.
We're making a trade. I'm giving him my motorcycle helmet - he's giving me his radar detector.
Come on lets go. I got the helmet. Lets get the radar detector.
Hey, hey, hey. (to Jerry) I hear you've got some lip reader working for you. You gotta let me use her for one day. Just one day.
(Pondering Kramer's plan out loud) They do have an intimate knowledge of the street..
(singing) Nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine bottle and cans in the trunk, nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine bottles and cans. At ten cents a bottle and ten cents a can, we're pulling in five hundred dollars a man. Nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight bottle and cans in the trunk, nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight bottles and cans. We fill up with gas, we count up our cash!!...
That was the Vice President of the post office. I didn't get the transfer.. They knew it wasn't me doing my route!
Well, it would take a hell of a lot. Because a friend is something you earn.
He cant hear you, you idiot. Why dont you just buy another one.
Oh no. Don't tell me. You're gambling again, aren't you? Oh you weak, weak man. Where are you?
You dated her. Give me some inside information. Anything I can use!
All right, all right. I'll help you but I will except something in return.
Hey Kramer, those have wholesale value! We could cut our losses.
We had a deal. Are you reneging out of the deal? Are you reneging? That's a renege.
You know, those mail bags, they get mighty heavy. I uh, I Nautilus, of course. (puffs out his chest)
(moving away from the counter getting closer to the door) Hello Jerry.
(Gesturing to dishes and silverware on the table) But you can clear some of this stuff out of the way.
(interrogating Kramer) Mister Kramer, you heard the testimony so far. Would you please tell the court in your own words what happened on the afternoon of September 10th?
You are nothing but a piece of crap.
I'm homeless! I'm gonna be out on a street corner, dancing for nickels. I'll be with the hobos in the trainyard, eating out of a bucket.
Alright, go ahead and hit me, Seinfeld. I got witnesses.
I don't care. It was good. I was enjoying it. Had to interfere. Couldn't leave well enough alone. Well, I will get even with you for this. You can count on it.
(to Kramer) You wanna know why you can't go in front first? I'll tell you why. because it signals a breakdown in the social order. Chaos. It reduces us to jungle law.
(Cannot take this torture anymore) Baaaaaaaaarrhhhhhhhhhhh....I'm ripped with fleas ( scratches furiously)
(Sinister) All right, all right. All right you go ahead. You go ahead and keep it secret. But you remember this. When you control the mail, you control... information.
There's another way it can go down, and it's going down right now!
I did invite you. Your invitation must've gotten ... lost in the mail.
Okay, you're all set? You got your story?
You've come at a bad time now. Could you come back later?
For I am in love with Svetlana, and I don't care if the whole world knows, except for Silvio, who would throw me out of the apartment, where I would be dancing on the sidewalk--
(To Rusty) Alright, uh, take it down to the end of the block. Make a controlled turn, and bring her back. Let's see what you've got! Ok? Ready, and go!
I had gone up to Westchester. I go there every Tuesday. I do charity for the blind in my spare time for the Lighthouse. I was in the middle of a game of Parcheesi with an old blind man and I excused myself to call my friend as he was very depressed lately because he never became a banker.
And then, just as I'm about to go, these boxes show up at the post office with no labels. No labels, Jerry. You know what that means? Freebies!! I got this great mini-TV and a VCR, oh it's unbelievable.
I guess there's not much action down there these days.
You're in trouble, Kramer. I shouldn't even be talking to you, but I'm telling you as a friend. Here's how it's going to happen you may be walking. Maybe on a crisp, autumn day just like today. When a mail truck will slow beside you, and a door will open, and a mailman you know, maybe even trust, will offer to give you a lift.
That he may be. But he's outta my life, starting in the year two-thousand. For me, the next millennium must be, Jerry-free!
(excited) We carry a coupla bags of mail, and the rest is ours!
South America?! (to Jerry) What kind of snow blower you get us mixed up with?
(leaving) Oh, by the way, what are you doing for the Super Bowl?
I have a carpet sweeper you can use.
Oh, can I watch a little? Cuz it's my favorite movie.
If we put our three heads together we should come up with something.
Well, you've both presented very convincing arguments. On the one hand, Elaine, your promise was given in haste. But was it not still a promise? Hmm?
I don't know. The man makes a pretty strong bird.
Yeah well, the budget changed, you know. I mean, it might be a good investment.
Why I didn't see you at Schindler's List with Jerry.
To Hawaii. The most sought-after postal route of them all. The air is so dewy-sweet you don't even have to like the stamps.. But it's not to be - So, I'm hanging it up.
What kind of dog did you say it was?
Ahh! This is very much as I imagined it to be. Aside from this rattan piece, which seems oddly out of place.
We have some questions we'd like you to answer.
Those records are worth more than five dollars!
Well for starters I want a calzone of my own.....
(squeezing himself through the narrow space) Nothing, just being neighborly. Do you wanna hang out? Shoot the breeze?
Well, you should take a look at my rug then.
Exactly. You're a disgrace to the uniform. (Newman takes off Jerry's mailman hat. Jerry turns his head in shame. Newman then tears the post office badge from Jerry's coat)
I have a private matter to discuss with my fellow tenants. (Opens door) If you don't mind?
I called in sick. I don't work in the rain.
The mother of all mail days. And guess who signed up for the truck.
Hey, hey maybe I should go with him?
Uh, you, uh, you better put something on.
"Pam." I don't know the woman, but she sounds quite fetching.
Quite frankly, I don't see how it's any of your business.
It was your family that pushed you into banking , it was their dream for you...
So, to what do I owe this unusual invitation?
...But, you must promise That you will abide by my decision, no matter how unjust it may seem to either of you. Do I have your word?
Excuse me Miss Weaver, OH! My god it is you! I.. I've seen your show six times..
All right, all right. Go ahead, go ahead.
It's pretty hot under these lights huh Seinfeld. Pretty....... Hot .
Stop it, George, stop it. I was defending your parking.
(From outside the room) Kramer? Kramer? (Enters Jerry's bedroom) There you are.
(mouth full) It's delicious mutton. This is uh, this is outta sight. I would, I would love to get the recipe. It's very good.
Hellooo Jerry. What a rare treat. What brings you down to the east wing?
(smugly) That is seven dollars and twenty-two cents better.
Oh, Mother's Day. (inspiration strikes) Wait a second. Mother's Day?!
Well, h ha ha- if you're happy with her, that's all that matters.
Hey, you want me to mail it? I'm on my way out anyway.
Aahh! You're great,It's great, It's so great to see a show that's (looks at Jerry) about something.
I know you know, but you don't know what I know.
Uh ah (stops her from closing the door; walks in) Having a nice trip? (walks over, grabs a junior mint, smells it then puts it in his pocket)
The guy who had the Hawaii transfer got busted for hoarding Victoria Secret catalogues. I gotta deliver that mail!
Nevertheless, sometime this afternoon, behind the Market Diner, an unmarked van will be waiting. I'm expecting the call at any time. Are you in?
Hello, Jerry. Will he take it? I gotta go to work.
I'll handle this, Violet. Why don't you take your three hour break? Oh, calm down, everyone. No one's cancelling any mail.
Jerry, you better stop her or Ill tell.
Well, let me remind you of something. You wouldn't be here if it wasn't for me and my helmet. I saved your life! You would be dead! Dead! You would cease to exist! You would be gone for the rest of eternity! You wouldn't even begin to comprehend what that means!!
Look, I don't have time to explain every little thing to you.
One winsome tulip we ceaselessly yearn for throughout our dreary, workaday lives! And you, my friend, have found your angel. I can tell. For my heart has also been captured by a breathless beauty - whom I fear I will never possess.
Alright, alright, back, savages. Back! I haven't made my wish yet..
Hey! What are you doing? It's after six o'clock! You can't give me a ticket! Hey, you're not gonna get away with this. I'll fight this. I got witnesses.
Well why do we have to keep this from Jerry?
And therein lies the tragedy. For I believe, sadly for you, that there is but one woman meant for each of us. One perfect angel for whom we are put on this earth.
We had an arguement about me going to Hawaii, and he locked onto my ankle like it was a soup bone. I'm hubbled! I don't think I can do my route - and they're awarding the transfer in two days!
Well, I wouldn't hear of it. I said, "Nice try, granny!" And I sent her to the back of the line!
Yeah? Well, you bombed! That story stunk worse than these chairs!
I hope you know what you're doing... (Kramer gives Newman a look of lack of confidence)
Hello Jerry. (to Kramer) What did you say to Elaine? I just got her cancellation in the mail.
You know I hear Mr. Steinbrenner can be a bit erratic. I would hate to see him when he's hungry.
Because I don't, never have, anything I read was already open.
Just to tell me to keep off the snacks!
(Thinks for a moment) I guess you're right. It's just walking around putting it into boxes..
I hope he stays this happy when he wakes up.
Gotta go. Oh gee, I dropped a nickel (reaches down and picks up the hair.)
All right give it to me. let go ...
Gentlemen, gentlemen. I am so happy to see you both. There is just some inconsistencies I'd like to straighten out.
When the cop stopped me, I told him that I was rushing home because my friend was about to commit suicide.
(on the phone in his apartment with a Bald head) Not for a while.
All right. I'm going in. Keep the motor running.
Him and his little buxom friend Rachel were going at it pretty good in the balcony.
You just got it? Damn, the mail is slow.
(Urgent) I need that mail, where is it?!
Every night I sleep in a really hot room, I don't want to kill myself.
Hey, another round of strawberry for me and my friends.
Alright then, I guess I can accept a little Jerry, if it gets me a (suggestive) lot of Elaine.
Well, I hear it's quite beautiful there this time of year, and of course you know I'm one-quarter French.
All right! All right. I wont say anything.
Oh, well it's a good thing for Jerry that you didn't go.
I cant eat fruit. It makes me incontinent.
Because right now, I'm the only chance you've got. (Newman giggles nervously. Jerry makes Newman flinch, and his giggling is choked off.)
A radar detector, as I understand it, DETECTS RADAR! WITH A SERIES OF BEEPS AND FLASHING LIGHTS. But oddly, for some reason I didn't hear a thing except for the sound of a police siren.
(sings) You're once. Twice. Three times a lady.
Hey Jerry. Look at all the towels they gave me! I really hit the jackpot! (holding a large stack of towels, Newman pats his face with the top one) Ha, ha, ha.
But Jerry, we've got this new supervisor down at the post office. He's working behind this glass. I know they're talking about me. They're going to transfer me, I know it. Two hours, give me two hours.
I WANT MY HELMET BACK! GIVE ME BACK MY HELMET AND YOU'RE GOING TO PAY FOR THAT TICKET.
It's gorgeous water. (pause) Do we own Bermuda?
I could give you my uniform from my rookie year.
Clean? Hardly. This looks like a man that isn't happy with his stereo performance.
Yes, I called you, you idiot! Because you were going to... You were going to... Remember?
I see many dogs on my mail route. I'll bet there's not one type of mutt or mongrel I haven't run across.
(laughing) Oh ho right. Well very nice seeing you folks and a by the way you didn't hear this from me. Tata (runs down the hallway laughing)
ha ha ha Well you know sometimes it just has a way of finding you. Cigarette?
(from the corner of the Yogurt shop) Hey, Jerry. Thanks a lot. I hope you're happy.
(smug) As a matter of fact, I did.
Pilot? So what do you make for something like that? Fifty? Sixty thousand?
(peering at bottle label) What is this 'MI, ten cents'?
I HAD a girlfriend and she was pretty wild.
Well, tootle loo. And nice seeing you again Margaret, goodbye Jerry. Have fun. Hehe
I believe the deal was that I get the calzones on my mail route. Well today I won't be going on my mail route! Will I. Perhaps tomorrow.
(a touch desperate) Ah, look, I..I'm sorry to bother you, but I'm a US postal worker and my mail truck was just ambushed by a band of backwoods mail-hating survivalists.
Jerry, George. [To Kramer] So, did you ask him about the records?
Kind of. I'm still collecting checks, I'm just not delivering mail.
Jerry wouldn't know delicate beauty if it bludgeoned him over the head.
Well, you'll never guess what happened to me today. I was uh, driving ( Jerry and Kramer turn away) home on the palisades parkway when I looked in the rear view mirror and what did I see? The fuzz. And it's funny because my new radar detector was on. I didn't hear a thing. Isn't that strange?
Hey, you know this is kind of fun.
Well he really seemed to have his hands full if you know what I mean.
(Yelling out to Rusty) Alright, pace yourself, 'Cause you're gonna have to do this all day for very little money.
Hmm, that job sounds like it might be worth a year's free haircuts. And a comb.
Great streak of luck I'm having. First, Kramer almost beat me at Risk but I narrowly escaped, and then Tim Whatley gives me his Super Bowl ticket.
Are you going to give me back that helmet or not?
Hello, Jerry. Tim couldn't make it, he's in love. Isn't that wonderful?
Not so fast pretty boy. There is more to this sorted little affair.
And yet, it's perfectly legal to take a man's soul and crush it out like a stale Pall Mall.
What you need me in the car for?
The courthouse. You gotta go with me to the courthouse. I'm contesting a ticket today.
Fleas? Bwa ha ha ha ha .That's preposterous. How can I , give you fleas. Now if you don't mind...
With your looks and my words, we'll have built the perfect beast. (Kramer claps him on the shoulder, then goes to the other side of the aisle to talk to Pam.)
He's shipping us a rickshaw. It can't miss!
You know, old friend, sometimes I ponder this silly gulf between us and I say, "Why?" Are we really so different. For what is--
You know, when you think about it, it's kind of silly for us both to pull this thing all t he way back uptown. I mean, after all, it is a conveyance.
All right! But hear me and hear me well - The day will come. Oh yes, mark my words, Seinfeld - your day of reckoning is coming. When an evil wind will blow through your little playworld, and wipe that smug smile off your face. And I'll be there, in all my glory, watching - watching as it all comes crumbling down.
Look, sister, go get yourself a cup of coffee, all right? Beat it! (Pushes Elaine out the door and closes it) All right, now here's the lowdown. From a certain connection, I've been able to locate some black market shower heads. They're all made in the former Yugoslavia, and from what I hear the Serbs are fanatic about their showers.
Not so fast, Elaine! Only the bike's true owner would rather give it away than see it come to harm. Kramer, the bike is yours!
Well, don't tarry. I'm behind schedule as it is.
No, no, no, no no. Listen to me. Most days, the post office sends one truckload of mail to the second domestic regional sorting facility in Sagenaw, Michigan.
No, no, no. That's not gonna work. Something else.
Yeah. I just hope Tim Whatley's electric bills don't suddenly get lost in the mail, or it could be lights out for him.
We'll pay anything. We've got the (hands a wad of money to Kramer) What about Jerry?
(at the counter) Pair of bear claws please.
The reverse peepholes. Silvio said I'm an agitator and I'm out of the building.
(to Kramer) That's where my missing soda is.
If you ask me, they have no business living amongst us. Vile, USELESS BEASTS . . .
He did it right in this bed, Martin. Right in front of you.
So I sped home to save my friend's life and I was stopped for speeding. Yes, I admit I was speeding but it was to save a man's life. A close friend. An innocent person who wanted nothing more out of life than to love, to be loved and to be a banker.
(Talking to another man) ...yeah he worked in the cubicle right next to me. We once double dated.
Cancel! (jumps to feet) Think again, longshanks! I started planning this in nineteen seventy-eight. I put a deposit down on that revolving restaurant that overlooks Times Square, and I booked Christopher Cross.
Yeah, just the way that I was raised. I'm special.
I was speaking earlier with Kramer and he mentioned something about a private jet to Paris?
It looks like your breaking into it like an otter breaking into a clad.
All my work, my planning, my genius. All for nought.
Yes! A more offensive spectacle I cannot recall. Anyway I just really came up to get some detergent.
Gladly. (starts munching on the broccoli, then spits it out)
Don't despair, my friend. (Newman walks in front of Kramer and trips over his feet. Again.) I won't allow your love to go unrequited. Not like mine.
He must have caught a glimpse of us when I poured that beer on his head.
Tuesday has no feel. Monday has a feel, Friday has a feel, Sunday has a feel....
What keeps the water in there? I mean, why doesn't it disappear?
What d'you mean it doesn't work? You get enough bottles together...
No! And no one will ever see you again!
(thinking to himself; checks a comb) No. (checks a brush) Jackpot. I don't believe this. There's no hair in this thing. I've never seen a person that didn't have at least one hair in a brush.
Damn you Seinfeld. You useless pustule. Um, somebody's got something on the griddle. maybe it's Kramer.
(to Kramer) You shut up! (to judge) I demand a recess so I can take him outside and help him regain hius composure.
Yuh, yes. I intend to Your Honor. And then, on the afternoon of September 10th, you received a phone call did you not?
Ah, don't worry about a thing. In twenty minutes that place'll be swarming with mailmen. We'll be back on the street by lunch.
Aww, c'mon, pull over, pull over will ya.
(seeing postal security officials walking towards Kramer) Quick! Get in!
(sobbing) Yes, it's been awful. I wanted to tell somebody. (pleading) Help me Kramer! Help me!
You know Ron's Records down on Bleeker? They pay big cash for used records!
I know exactly how he feels. Pleasure doing business with you. Do come again. Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Well, there is a little something you can do for me...
