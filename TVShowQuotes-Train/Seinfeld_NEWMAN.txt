All right! All right. I wont say anything.
...But, you must promise That you will abide by my decision, no matter how unjust it may seem to either of you. Do I have your word?
You heard me. So he packed it up and split for the coast. La-La Land. L.A.
Why I didn't see you at Schindler's List with Jerry.
That's good stuff, and you can never have too much ice. Alright, I'll tell you what I'll do. You can co-host the party with me, under one condition. No Jerry. Jerry is not invited.
Well, ELAINE, There's any number of things I could do. But, I can promise you this, though, this vicious beast will never bother you again. So, what's it going to be?
Hey! You're not dumping those bottles back there, are you?
Alright then, I guess I can accept a little Jerry, if it gets me a (suggestive) lot of Elaine.
That he may be. But he's outta my life, starting in the year two-thousand. For me, the next millennium must be, Jerry-free!
Jerry wouldn't know delicate beauty if it bludgeoned him over the head.
Not so fast, Elaine! Only the bike's true owner would rather give it away than see it come to harm. Kramer, the bike is yours!
Alright, alright, back, savages. Back! I haven't made my wish yet..
Banker! So you're killing yourself because your dreams of becoming a banker have gone unfulfilled. You-you-you-you can't live without being a banker.
Well, you know how much those records are worth!?
You gave me a defective detector. ... Jerry?
Are you sure you know where the impound yard is?
Hey Jerry. Look at all the towels they gave me! I really hit the jackpot! (holding a large stack of towels, Newman pats his face with the top one) Ha, ha, ha.
[In Kramer's ear] The old coot's sittin' on a mountain of gold!
You know, those mail bags, they get mighty heavy. I uh, I Nautilus, of course. (puffs out his chest)
We had a deal. Are you reneging out of the deal? Are you reneging? That's a renege.
He's shipping us a rickshaw. It can't miss!
He did it right in this bed, Martin. Right in front of you.
ha ha ha Well you know sometimes it just has a way of finding you. Cigarette?
Cancel! (jumps to feet) Think again, longshanks! I started planning this in nineteen seventy-eight. I put a deposit down on that revolving restaurant that overlooks Times Square, and I booked Christopher Cross.
...But I have made a decision. (revelatory) We will cut the bike down the middle, and give half to each of you.
Wait a minute. You mean you get five cents here, and ten cents there. You could round up bottles here and run 'em out to Michigan for the difference.
I was speaking earlier with Kramer and he mentioned something about a private jet to Paris?
You know, old friend, sometimes I ponder this silly gulf between us and I say, "Why?" Are we really so different. For what is--
The bank. What about your cards and letters?
(thinking to himself; checks a comb) No. (checks a brush) Jackpot. I don't believe this. There's no hair in this thing. I've never seen a person that didn't have at least one hair in a brush.
Him and his little buxom friend Rachel were going at it pretty good in the balcony.
Maybe we could uh, stop for a snack.
Ah, don't worry about a thing. In twenty minutes that place'll be swarming with mailmen. We'll be back on the street by lunch.
(smug) As a matter of fact, I did.
I have a private matter to discuss with my fellow tenants. (Opens door) If you don't mind?
(leaving) Oh, by the way, what are you doing for the Super Bowl?
He must have caught a glimpse of us when I poured that beer on his head.
Yes, yes. May I go? Cause I gotta go very badly.
(moving away from the counter getting closer to the door) Hello Jerry.
...it takes just as much man-power to deliver it as their precious little greeting cards...
Great streak of luck I'm having. First, Kramer almost beat me at Risk but I narrowly escaped, and then Tim Whatley gives me his Super Bowl ticket.
(breaking from his pose) Can I have some gravy?
Exactly. You're a disgrace to the uniform. (Newman takes off Jerry's mailman hat. Jerry turns his head in shame. Newman then tears the post office badge from Jerry's coat)
All my work, my planning, my genius. All for nought.
Because I don't, never have, anything I read was already open.
Yes I am, a guy on my mail route just got a couple of tickets and he offered one to me.
Is it?! Ohhh, well if only you'd known, you could have saved some time and given it directly to me! Ha ha ha.
For I am in love with Svetlana, and I don't care if the whole world knows, except for Silvio, who would throw me out of the apartment, where I would be dancing on the sidewalk--
I just heard that a postman spotted a rickshaw down in Battery Park.
Jerry, you better stop her or Ill tell.
And, Kramer, you did provide a service in exchange for compensation. But, does the fee, once paid, not entitle the buyer to some assurance Of reliability? Hmm? Huh? Ahh. These were not easy questions to answer. Not for any man...
You see, it'd been his lifelong dream to be a banker and he uh, just the day before he was turned down by another bank. I believe it was the Manufacturer's Hanover on Lexington and 40th Street. That was the third bank to turn him down so I was-I was a little concerned. I wanted to see how he was doing. Well, Your Honor, he was barely audible. But I distinctly recall him say...
It's the romance of the Handsome Cab without the guilt or dander of the equine.
(Thinks for a moment) I guess you're right. It's just walking around putting it into boxes..
Gentlemen, gentlemen. I am so happy to see you both. There is just some inconsistencies I'd like to straighten out.
I don't care. It was good. I was enjoying it. Had to interfere. Couldn't leave well enough alone. Well, I will get even with you for this. You can count on it.
(To his new girlfriend) You see, my dear, all certified mail is registered, but registered mail is not necessarily certified.
Don't you have a-a boyfriend? A, uh, burly, athletic type?
(Stands up) Too many people go their mail! Close to 80%. No body from the post office has ever cracked the 50% barrier! It's like the 3-minute mile!
I usually do. (Gets up to leave) See ya.
All right. Then let me ask you this. Didn't you find it interesting that your friend had the foresight to purchase postal insurance for your stereo. Huh. I mean parcels are rarely damaged during shipping.
Gladly. (starts munching on the broccoli, then spits it out)
Oh no. No no no no. I bought it from Kramer. He was hard up for cash. Fifty bucks! (he laughs) Can you believe it? Of course, I had to make some minor modifications, you know. Solid tires, reinforced seatpost, heavy duty shocks. But, baby, this is one sweet ride.
Hey, you want me to mail it? I'm on my way out anyway.
Look, sister, go get yourself a cup of coffee, all right? Beat it! (Pushes Elaine out the door and closes it) All right, now here's the lowdown. From a certain connection, I've been able to locate some black market shower heads. They're all made in the former Yugoslavia, and from what I hear the Serbs are fanatic about their showers.
Well if you watch closely enough, you just might see me. I'll be the one waving to the camera from my seat on the forty yard line.
Oh well. Let me perfectly blunt. I don't care for you Costanza. You hang out at the west side of the building with Seinfeld all day and just it up wasting your lives.
So what? Do you know whose mailbag that is?
Hello, Jerry. Will he take it? I gotta go to work.
(reluctant) You don't wanna do your... act, or anything, do you?
What you need me in the car for?
Hey, hey, hey. (to Jerry) I hear you've got some lip reader working for you. You gotta let me use her for one day. Just one day.
And one more thing. I'm not coming to your party. (exits)
Nevertheless, sometime this afternoon, behind the Market Diner, an unmarked van will be waiting. I'm expecting the call at any time. Are you in?
Well, you'll never guess what happened to me today. I was uh, driving ( Jerry and Kramer turn away) home on the palisades parkway when I looked in the rear view mirror and what did I see? The fuzz. And it's funny because my new radar detector was on. I didn't hear a thing. Isn't that strange?
Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry.
Hellooo Jerry. What a rare treat. What brings you down to the east wing?
Hello Jerry. (to Kramer) What did you say to Elaine? I just got her cancellation in the mail.
June 14th, 1987. Mets Phillies. You made a big error. Cost the Mets the game. Then you're coming up the parking lot ramp.
Hey, don't listen to him. I mean, we can't afford a detour. Our budget won't hold it.
(Talking to another man) ...yeah he worked in the cubicle right next to me. We once double dated.
Now, you're that firend. Now, all we need is a reason why you were going to commit suicide.
Easy, Jerry. Steady. You wouldn't want to lose your cool at a time like this.
Uh ah (stops her from closing the door; walks in) Having a nice trip? (walks over, grabs a junior mint, smells it then puts it in his pocket)
Hey, we can't follow him, we're going north to Michigan.
(to Kramer) That's where my missing soda is.
(Yelling out to Rusty) Alright, pace yourself, 'Cause you're gonna have to do this all day for very little money.
"Pam." I don't know the woman, but she sounds quite fetching.
(Sinister) All right, all right. All right you go ahead. You go ahead and keep it secret. But you remember this. When you control the mail, you control... information.
Just to tell me to keep off the snacks!
Yeah? Well, you bombed! That story stunk worse than these chairs!
I went through all those bottles and all those cans, for what? What a waste. And I'm really gonna catch hell for those missing mailbags.
One winsome tulip we ceaselessly yearn for throughout our dreary, workaday lives! And you, my friend, have found your angel. I can tell. For my heart has also been captured by a breathless beauty - whom I fear I will never possess.
Okay, you're all set? You got your story?
I'm homeless! I'm gonna be out on a street corner, dancing for nickels. I'll be with the hobos in the trainyard, eating out of a bucket.
Well, you should take a look at my rug then.
"Do not bend". (Laughs evilly) Just crease, crumple, cram.. you'll do fine. (Phone rings. Newman answers it) Hello?.. This is he. I don't understand.. very well. (Hangs up in disappointment)
You know I hear Mr. Steinbrenner can be a bit erratic. I would hate to see him when he's hungry.
Yeah. I just hope Tim Whatley's electric bills don't suddenly get lost in the mail, or it could be lights out for him.
You're in trouble, Kramer. I shouldn't even be talking to you, but I'm telling you as a friend. Here's how it's going to happen you may be walking. Maybe on a crisp, autumn day just like today. When a mail truck will slow beside you, and a door will open, and a mailman you know, maybe even trust, will offer to give you a lift.
But you never became a banker, did you Mister Kramer? Why? Why did you fail?
But, on the week before holidays, we see a surge. On alentine's Day, we send two trucks. On Christmas, four, packed to the brim. And tomorrow, if history is any guide, will see some spillover into a fifth truck.
So, to what do I owe this unusual invitation?
Well, I wouldn't hear of it. I said, "Nice try, granny!" And I sent her to the back of the line!
Aww, c'mon, pull over, pull over will ya.
Well, there is a little something you can do for me...
Yeah, just the way that I was raised. I'm special.
So, which one of us is gonna pull?
It was a cinch. Where are you going?
All right! But hear me and hear me well - The day will come. Oh yes, mark my words, Seinfeld - your day of reckoning is coming. When an evil wind will blow through your little playworld, and wipe that smug smile off your face. And I'll be there, in all my glory, watching - watching as it all comes crumbling down.
So , you have fleas. Maybe you keep your house in a state of disrepair. Maybe you live in squalor.
Come on lets go. I got the helmet. Lets get the radar detector.
We're making a trade. I'm giving him my motorcycle helmet - he's giving me his radar detector.
(a touch desperate) Ah, look, I..I'm sorry to bother you, but I'm a US postal worker and my mail truck was just ambushed by a band of backwoods mail-hating survivalists.
I HAD a girlfriend and she was pretty wild.
Hey, hey maybe I should go with him?
I could give you my uniform from my rookie year.
Reversed?! (Kramer comes hobbling out of the doctors office in pain, after having a vasectomy of his own, and exits. Jerry and Newman look at each other, and bolt for the door themselves.)
I hope he stays this happy when he wakes up.
You've come at a bad time now. Could you come back later?
And a slice of pepperoni pizza and a large soda and three times a week I will require a canolie.
Oh, Mother's Day. (inspiration strikes) Wait a second. Mother's Day?!
I WANT MY HELMET BACK! GIVE ME BACK MY HELMET AND YOU'RE GOING TO PAY FOR THAT TICKET.
Aahh! You're great,It's great, It's so great to see a show that's (looks at Jerry) about something.
I cant eat fruit. It makes me incontinent.
All right, it's true! Of course nobody needs mail. What do you think, you're so clever for figuring that out? But you don't know the half of what goes on here. So just walk away, Kramer. I beg of you.
Hey, another round of strawberry for me and my friends.
So I sped home to save my friend's life and I was stopped for speeding. Yes, I admit I was speeding but it was to save a man's life. A close friend. An innocent person who wanted nothing more out of life than to love, to be loved and to be a banker.
So we could put the bottles in a U-haul. You know, go lean and mean?
Oh, how I've waited for this moment. But alas, my heart belongs to another man's wife, and I have given the coat to her.
(laughing) Oh ho right. Well very nice seeing you folks and a by the way you didn't hear this from me. Tata (runs down the hallway laughing)
(to Kramer) You wanna know why you can't go in front first? I'll tell you why. because it signals a breakdown in the social order. Chaos. It reduces us to jungle law.
(Urgent) I need that mail, where is it?!
I had gone up to Westchester. I go there every Tuesday. I do charity for the blind in my spare time for the Lighthouse. I was in the middle of a game of Parcheesi with an old blind man and I excused myself to call my friend as he was very depressed lately because he never became a banker.
Oh yes, in fact I still have family there. This probably won't interest you, but I have a cousin there who's suffering very badly. She's lost all use of her muscles. She can only communicate by blinking. I would so love to see her - bring a ray of sunshine into her tragic life. But alas, I can't afford it, for I am, as you know, but a simple postal worker.
Hello, Jerry. Say, this yogurt is really something, huh? And it's non-fat! I've been waiting for something like this my whole life! And it's finally here!
Jerry! What could she possibly see in Jerry? (Walks in front of Kramer and trips over his feet.)
You just got it? Damn, the mail is slow.
The mother of all mail days. And guess who signed up for the truck.
Because right now, I'm the only chance you've got. (Newman giggles nervously. Jerry makes Newman flinch, and his giggling is choked off.)
A radar detector, as I understand it, DETECTS RADAR! WITH A SERIES OF BEEPS AND FLASHING LIGHTS. But oddly, for some reason I didn't hear a thing except for the sound of a police siren.
I have a carpet sweeper you can use.
What d'you mean it doesn't work? You get enough bottles together...
Not going to play ball. Huh all right. Admit it that stereo was all ready busted.
And that failure to become a banker was eating at you. Eating-eating-eating at you inside.
All right, I'm going to need a clean 8 ounce glass.
If I'm curt, then I appologize. But as I understand it, we have a situation here and time is of the essence.
You're telling how your parents pushed you into banking.
Oh, don't you? Joke boy? You really think you can manipulate that beautiful young woman like the half-soused nightclub rabble that lap up your inane "observations"?
(from the corner of the Yogurt shop) Hey, Jerry. Thanks a lot. I hope you're happy.
(squeezing himself through the narrow space) Nothing, just being neighborly. Do you wanna hang out? Shoot the breeze?
Hey, we got ten thousand deposit bottles here. I mean, this guy could be going to Arkansas.
I'll handle this, Violet. Why don't you take your three hour break? Oh, calm down, everyone. No one's cancelling any mail.
Pilot? So what do you make for something like that? Fifty? Sixty thousand?
You wanna know what happened to Kramer? I'll tell you what happened to Kramer. He was ticked off. About the keys. Yeah, that's right - about the keys. Thought he got a bad rap.
Take it or leave it!? We got *Al Jolson* here, *Al Jolson*!!
... a man can really get some thinking done. (sits on couch, next to Kramer.)
(Kissing the woman) Beauty .. and brains. (they nuzzle noses)
I know you know, but you don't know what I know.
No. I need a really pretty face. But, Hey, that's me.
(With a gorgeous woman sitting on his lap) Did I?
And then, just as I'm about to go, these boxes show up at the post office with no labels. No labels, Jerry. You know what that means? Freebies!! I got this great mini-TV and a VCR, oh it's unbelievable.
Jerry, George. [To Kramer] So, did you ask him about the records?
Well for starters I want a calzone of my own.....
(sings) You're once. Twice. Three times a lady.
(interrogating Kramer) Mister Kramer, you heard the testimony so far. Would you please tell the court in your own words what happened on the afternoon of September 10th?
(reluctant) You know, I don't really know that much about uh.. I don't have any.. I don't.. I don't think I know much about that.
(mouth full) It's delicious mutton. This is uh, this is outta sight. I would, I would love to get the recipe. It's very good.
Sorry. But love is spice with many tastes. A dizzying array of textures...and moments.
Are you going to give me back that helmet or not?
Gotta go. Oh gee, I dropped a nickel (reaches down and picks up the hair.)
(Pondering Kramer's plan out loud) They do have an intimate knowledge of the street..
I guess there's not much action down there these days.
Hey, you know this is kind of fun.
Mmm. You present an interesting dilemma. Each of you seemingly has a legitimate claim to the bicycle, and yet the bicycle can have only one rightful owner. Quite the conundrum. As a federal employee, I believe the law is all we have. (getting worked up) It's all that separates us from the savages who don't deserve even the privilege of the daily mail. (angry) Stuffing parcels into mailboxes where they don't belong!!...
It was your family that pushed you into banking , it was their dream for you...
What makes you think I'm lookin' for trouble?
That was the Vice President of the post office. I didn't get the transfer.. They knew it wasn't me doing my route!
(Gesturing to dishes and silverware on the table) But you can clear some of this stuff out of the way.
I dont care much for the beach. I freckle. . . . Is that a,..
Well, I'm not paying the five cents for that stupid recycling thing.
We have some questions we'd like you to answer.
(to Kramer) You shut up! (to judge) I demand a recess so I can take him outside and help him regain hius composure.
The reverse peepholes. Silvio said I'm an agitator and I'm out of the building.
Well, let me remind you of something. You wouldn't be here if it wasn't for me and my helmet. I saved your life! You would be dead! Dead! You would cease to exist! You would be gone for the rest of eternity! You wouldn't even begin to comprehend what that means!!
Yeah well, the budget changed, you know. I mean, it might be a good investment.
(excited) We carry a coupla bags of mail, and the rest is ours!
We gotta find that rickshaw. You check the sewers and dumpsters. I'll hit the soup kitchens, bakeries, and smorgasbords.
This photo clearly indicates your involvement in some ill-conceived mail order pornography ring.As does this one found in the same disturbing packet.
Excuse me Miss Weaver, OH! My god it is you! I.. I've seen your show six times..
Are you married right now? (points at Jerry)
Oh, can I watch a little? Cuz it's my favorite movie.
Those records are worth more than five dollars!
(Cannot take this torture anymore) Baaaaaaaaarrhhhhhhhhhhh....I'm ripped with fleas ( scratches furiously)
It's gorgeous water. (pause) Do we own Bermuda?
All right. I'm going in. Keep the motor running.
I hope you know what you're doing... (Kramer gives Newman a look of lack of confidence)
I hope you realise what you've done. You've destroyed our whole venture.
Aaah! Aaagh! Aah-aah. Oh, oh the humanity! Aaagh!
I know exactly how he feels. Pleasure doing business with you. Do come again. Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Uh, you, uh, you better put something on.
Fleas? Bwa ha ha ha ha .That's preposterous. How can I , give you fleas. Now if you don't mind...
I can't sleep, I tell you! I can't sleep!
You gotta go with me. I mean, you-you're my alibi. You have to take the stand.
Kind of. I'm still collecting checks, I'm just not delivering mail.
With your looks and my words, we'll have built the perfect beast. (Kramer claps him on the shoulder, then goes to the other side of the aisle to talk to Pam.)
We'll pay anything. We've got the (hands a wad of money to Kramer) What about Jerry?
Then I turned and the spit ricochet of him and it hit me.
Clean? Hardly. This looks like a man that isn't happy with his stereo performance.
What, do I have to spell it out for ya? He was moving on her like the storm-troopers into Poland.
(seeing postal security officials walking towards Kramer) Quick! Get in!
But Jerry, we've got this new supervisor down at the post office. He's working behind this glass. I know they're talking about me. They're going to transfer me, I know it. Two hours, give me two hours.
(Strangling Kramer) What's the matter with you? We had it all worked out!
Because the mail never stops. It just keeps coming and coming and coming, there's never a let-up. It's relentless. Every day it piles up more and more and more! And you gotta get it out but the more you get it out the more it keeps coming in. And then the bar code reader breaks and it's *Publisher's Clearing House* day!!!
No sir. He did not. But only by thge grace of God. He's in the courtroom today
Oh no. Don't tell me. You're gambling again, aren't you? Oh you weak, weak man. Where are you?
How much longer you gonna be, I'm starving here.
What keeps the water in there? I mean, why doesn't it disappear?
Elaine's down there causing all kinds of commotion. Somehow she got a hold of his recipes and she says she's gonna drive him out of business! The Soup Nazi said that now that his recipes are out, he's not gonna make anymore soup! He's moving out of the country, moving to Argentina! No more soup, Jerry! No more for of us!
I took over his route. And boy, were there a lot of dogs on that route.
Oh, well it's a good thing for Jerry that you didn't go.
Kramer you might as well run along. Jerry might be a while. Suspicion of mail fraud.
And yet, it's perfectly legal to take a man's soul and crush it out like a stale Pall Mall.
I did invite you. Your invitation must've gotten ... lost in the mail.
South America?! (to Jerry) What kind of snow blower you get us mixed up with?
Your Honor, I'm only trying to establish Mister Kramer's fragile emotional state, my entire case depends on it.
Blast! There's no way I can handle 8 in addition to my ususal load of one! I'll never get to Hawaii! (Moves over to Jerry's couch, depressed) I'll be stuck in this apartment building forever! (Lays down on Jerry's couch) The dream is dead.
You know, when you think about it, it's kind of silly for us both to pull this thing all t he way back uptown. I mean, after all, it is a conveyance.
Once I find a barber I stick with him. I almost went to barber school. I always felt I had a talent for it.
June 14, 1987.... Mets Phillies. We're enjoying a beautiful afternoon in the right field stands when a crucial Hernandez error to a five run Phillies ninth. Cost the Mets the game.
He cant hear you, you idiot. Why dont you just buy another one.
Sorry , last one . Would you want to suck the pit?
Tuesday has no feel. Monday has a feel, Friday has a feel, Sunday has a feel....
I called in sick. I don't work in the rain.
Don't despair, my friend. (Newman walks in front of Kramer and trips over his feet. Again.) I won't allow your love to go unrequited. Not like mine.
To Hawaii. The most sought-after postal route of them all. The air is so dewy-sweet you don't even have to like the stamps.. But it's not to be - So, I'm hanging it up.
Well, you've both presented very convincing arguments. On the one hand, Elaine, your promise was given in haste. But was it not still a promise? Hmm?
(From outside the room) Kramer? Kramer? (Enters Jerry's bedroom) There you are.
(at the counter) Pair of bear claws please.
Well, don't tarry. I'm behind schedule as it is.
When the cop stopped me, I told him that I was rushing home because my friend was about to commit suicide.
(peering at bottle label) What is this 'MI, ten cents'?
You can't taste 'em . Why waste 'em . Why not give them all to me.
Yes! A more offensive spectacle I cannot recall. Anyway I just really came up to get some detergent.
Not so fast pretty boy. There is more to this sorted little affair.
I see many dogs on my mail route. I'll bet there's not one type of mutt or mongrel I haven't run across.
Every night I sleep in a really hot room, I don't want to kill myself.
A second later, something happened that changed us in a deep and profound way front that day forward.
The guy who had the Hawaii transfer got busted for hoarding Victoria Secret catalogues. I gotta deliver that mail!
You know Ron's Records down on Bleeker? They pay big cash for used records!
Ah, she just didn't do it for me.
(To Rusty) Alright, uh, take it down to the end of the block. Make a controlled turn, and bring her back. Let's see what you've got! Ok? Ready, and go!
Stop it, George, stop it. I was defending your parking.
(on the phone in his apartment with a Bald head) Not for a while.
There's another way it can go down, and it's going down right now!
All right, all right. Go ahead, go ahead.
No, no, no. That's not gonna work. Something else.
We had an arguement about me going to Hawaii, and he locked onto my ankle like it was a soup bone. I'm hubbled! I don't think I can do my route - and they're awarding the transfer in two days!
Yuh, yes. I intend to Your Honor. And then, on the afternoon of September 10th, you received a phone call did you not?
Well, h ha ha- if you're happy with her, that's all that matters.
Hmm, that job sounds like it might be worth a year's free haircuts. And a comb.
Well, tootle loo. And nice seeing you again Margaret, goodbye Jerry. Have fun. Hehe
Hey Kramer, those have wholesale value! We could cut our losses.
You are nothing but a piece of crap.
It looks like your breaking into it like an otter breaking into a clad.
Hello Jerry. Well, I may have a solution to our little problem. Elaine, would you excuse us?
If you ask me, they have no business living amongst us. Vile, USELESS BEASTS . . .
It's pretty hot under these lights huh Seinfeld. Pretty....... Hot .
Well he really seemed to have his hands full if you know what I mean.
Yes, sir, I believe everything is all squared away. Isn't it, Mr. Kramer?
You dated her. Give me some inside information. Anything I can use!
No, no, no, no no. Listen to me. Most days, the post office sends one truckload of mail to the second domestic regional sorting facility in Sagenaw, Michigan.
Lately, though, I've been, uh, - I've been buying the generic brand of waxed beans. You know, I rip of the label I can hardly tell the difference.
Son of Sam. The worst mass murderer the post office ever produced.
Do you really want to know what happened? I'll tell you what Happened. She wasn't my type.
Damn you Seinfeld. You useless pustule. Um, somebody's got something on the griddle. maybe it's Kramer.
I don't know. The man makes a pretty strong bird.
He's giving away what's left! I gotta go home and get a big pot!
Well, it's-it's interesting work, I don't mind it.
Yes. It's called mail fraud. Oohhhh. How I've longed for this moment Seinfeld. The day when I would have the proof I needed to hall you out of your cushy lair and expose to the light of justice as the monster that you are. A monster so vile.....
There's no need to get excited. Can't we discuss this like gentlemen?
That guy thought we were a couple of total squares.
Quite frankly, I don't see how it's any of your business.
No, that's a fur coat! Hey, uh, give me a boost.
(Stands up and Sputtering loudly) Kramer! I'm with people.
Can't do it. I'm on an unbelievable birthday-wish hot streak! My last five birthday wishes came true.
What's the matter with you? I just talked to you fifteen minutes ago.
All right, all right. I'll help you but I will except something in return.
Well, it's her mistake. Because she is going to miss the party of a lifetime.
I wanna learn. I want to know why.
