All right, it's true! Of course nobody needs mail. What do you think, you're so clever for figuring that out? But you don't know the half of what goes on here. So just walk away, Kramer. I beg of you.
"Pam." I don't know the woman, but she sounds quite fetching.
Maybe we could uh, stop for a snack.
This photo clearly indicates your involvement in some ill-conceived mail order pornography ring.As does this one found in the same disturbing packet.
(screaming in panic) Aaah!! Aaah!
It was a real melee.
(sobbing) Yes, it's been awful. I wanted to tell somebody. (pleading) Help me Kramer! Help me!
Oh, don't you? Joke boy? You really think you can manipulate that beautiful young woman like the half-soused nightclub rabble that lap up your inane "observations"?
Ohh, were you there?
Uncle Leo? This case is closed pending further evidence. Jerry.
(Kissing the woman) Beauty .. and brains. (they nuzzle noses)
(on the phone in his apartment with a Bald head) Not for a while.
The bank. What about your cards and letters?
Aww..
I don't understand. You fill an eighteen-wheeler?
Go girl!
Look, I don't have time to explain every little thing to you.
(after speeding truck) Kramer!!
Pair of bear claws, please.
One large jambalaya, please.
Wow, it was McDowell.
Deh!
Kind of. I'm still collecting checks, I'm just not delivering mail.
No! And no one will ever see you again!
Coy? I'm not being coy.
Hey, you know this is kind of fun.
You've come at a bad time now. Could you come back later?
Hey, hey, hey. (to Jerry) I hear you've got some lip reader working for you. You gotta let me use her for one day. Just one day.
Alright.
It gets my rug clean.
So , you have fleas. Maybe you keep your house in a state of disrepair. Maybe you live in squalor.
Hey, another round of strawberry for me and my friends.
Pilot? So what do you make for something like that? Fifty? Sixty thousand?
Jerry, you better stop her or Ill tell.
(to Kramer) That's where my missing soda is.
Take me! Take me!
Don't despair, my friend. (Newman walks in front of Kramer and trips over his feet. Again.) I won't allow your love to go unrequited. Not like mine.
Shell.
(running out the door) Jerry! Jerry!
Can I try it on?
Jerry, George. [To Kramer] So, did you ask him about the records?
Kramer, what the hell are you doing?
Hellooo Jerry. What a rare treat. What brings you down to the east wing?
Oh the theater. Because I was wondering.
On what?
Those records are worth more than five dollars!
This isn't about my opening your mail?
I dont care much for the beach. I freckle. . . . Is that a,..
(laughs - T-heheheheheheheh) El Paso!
(a touch desperate) Ah, look, I..I'm sorry to bother you, but I'm a US postal worker and my mail truck was just ambushed by a band of backwoods mail-hating survivalists.
Sometimes...
The airport?
When the cop stopped me, I told him that I was rushing home because my friend was about to commit suicide.
With your looks and my words, we'll have built the perfect beast. (Kramer claps him on the shoulder, then goes to the other side of the aisle to talk to Pam.)
I was speaking earlier with Kramer and he mentioned something about a private jet to Paris?
Help! Help!
Aww, c'mon, pull over, pull over will ya.
Look, sister, go get yourself a cup of coffee, all right? Beat it! (Pushes Elaine out the door and closes it) All right, now here's the lowdown. From a certain connection, I've been able to locate some black market shower heads. They're all made in the former Yugoslavia, and from what I hear the Serbs are fanatic about their showers.
Yeah. Maybe.
Well sure it would.
Kramer!!
Thanks buddy. So long he he ...(exits)
Hey, what is that up that tree?
What about your bills?
(To his new girlfriend) You see, my dear, all certified mail is registered, but registered mail is not necessarily certified.
eue-aaa.
I guess there's not much action down there these days.
Oh, yeah, right.
Well, tootle loo. And nice seeing you again Margaret, goodbye Jerry. Have fun. Hehe
You must!
Will that take care of ours too?
I don't know, they're deranged.
You heard me. So he packed it up and split for the coast. La-La Land. L.A.
Just to tell me to keep off the snacks!
You must be banker.
We din, we didn't ... ... Cosmo?
I know you know, but you don't know what I know.
I don't know. The man makes a pretty strong bird.
I have a private matter to discuss with my fellow tenants. (Opens door) If you don't mind?
I believe the deal was that I get the calzones on my mail route. Well today I won't be going on my mail route! Will I. Perhaps tomorrow.
We made quite a haul.
Yeah, yeah.
(Eyes glued to the TV) I guess.
I'm leavin'. Jerry's a nut. (Exits)
We have some questions we'd like you to answer.
Butter?
Okay. What is it?
Okay, we'll go with the banker story.
Well, it would take a hell of a lot. Because a friend is something you earn.
And why was that?
I like the thick tape.
I too am well.
(interrogating Kramer) Mister Kramer, you heard the testimony so far. Would you please tell the court in your own words what happened on the afternoon of September 10th?
Jerry!
Boy, thats the full size.
Number 67, right here, right here!
Yeah, sure.
What you need me in the car for?
Alright, go ahead and hit me, Seinfeld. I got witnesses.
You are?
As you were saying, Mister Kramer...
(Suggesting Jerry) Does yours?
(eating) hm.
What kind of dog did you say it was?
A piece of crap.
(Together) Sucker..
One winsome tulip we ceaselessly yearn for throughout our dreary, workaday lives! And you, my friend, have found your angel. I can tell. For my heart has also been captured by a breathless beauty - whom I fear I will never possess.
...But I have made a decision. (revelatory) We will cut the bike down the middle, and give half to each of you.
Hello?
You gave me a defective detector. ... Jerry?
You know Ron's Records down on Bleeker? They pay big cash for used records!
Yes, Yes, now please. Someone, honey mustard.
To Hawaii. The most sought-after postal route of them all. The air is so dewy-sweet you don't even have to like the stamps.. But it's not to be - So, I'm hanging it up.
We had a deal. Are you reneging out of the deal? Are you reneging? That's a renege.
The courthouse. You gotta go with me to the courthouse. I'm contesting a ticket today.
Exactly. You're a disgrace to the uniform. (Newman takes off Jerry's mailman hat. Jerry turns his head in shame. Newman then tears the post office badge from Jerry's coat)
No, no I don't like it.
Yes, a phone call!
I swear.
To the Newmanniun! (holds out his hand)
June 14th, 1987. Mets Phillies. You made a big error. Cost the Mets the game. Then you're coming up the parking lot ramp.
You can't taste 'em . Why waste 'em . Why not give them all to me.
(singing) Nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine bottle and cans in the trunk, nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine bottles and cans. At ten cents a bottle and ten cents a can, we're pulling in five hundred dollars a man. Nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight bottle and cans in the trunk, nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight bottles and cans. We fill up with gas, we count up our cash!!...
Well, it's her mistake. Because she is going to miss the party of a lifetime.
Kramer bit me!
Hello Elaine. Where are they?
I WANT MY HELMET BACK! GIVE ME BACK MY HELMET AND YOU'RE GOING TO PAY FOR THAT TICKET.
I can't eat this.
Hello jerry. What a pleasant surprise.
Yeah well, the budget changed, you know. I mean, it might be a good investment.
Kramer!
(taking bottle) Refund?
Hi. How are you?
You're off your rocker.
(fleeing to the bedroom) Damn!
You know what I mean.
(Talking to another man) ...yeah he worked in the cubicle right next to me. We once double dated.
Anyway.
Are you married right now? (points at Jerry)
I told you he was a risk.
Gangway!
Reversed?! (Kramer comes hobbling out of the doctors office in pain, after having a vasectomy of his own, and exits. Jerry and Newman look at each other, and bolt for the door themselves.)
Ten cents!?
Kramer! Stay left. Left, left, left.
Alright, well be back... *jack*!
Vile weed!
Cancel! (jumps to feet) Think again, longshanks! I started planning this in nineteen seventy-eight. I put a deposit down on that revolving restaurant that overlooks Times Square, and I booked Christopher Cross.
All right. Then let me ask you this. Didn't you find it interesting that your friend had the foresight to purchase postal insurance for your stereo. Huh. I mean parcels are rarely damaged during shipping.
I had gone up to Westchester. I go there every Tuesday. I do charity for the blind in my spare time for the Lighthouse. I was in the middle of a game of Parcheesi with an old blind man and I excused myself to call my friend as he was very depressed lately because he never became a banker.
Yes, from me!! I called you remember?
Quite frankly, I don't see how it's any of your business.
Frequently.
We'll pay anything. We've got the (hands a wad of money to Kramer) What about Jerry?
No, no. I love strong cider. (for the farmer's daughter's benefit) I'm a big, strong, cider guy.
Hmm, that job sounds like it might be worth a year's free haircuts. And a comb.
Oh yes, in fact I still have family there. This probably won't interest you, but I have a cousin there who's suffering very badly. She's lost all use of her muscles. She can only communicate by blinking. I would so love to see her - bring a ray of sunshine into her tragic life. But alas, I can't afford it, for I am, as you know, but a simple postal worker.
Nah.
(triumphant) Yessss!
I have done nothing unethical.
I wanna learn. I want to know why.
Mouth-to-mouth?
Something's happened with the Soup Nazi!
Yeah, I suppose.
Hello, Jerry. How's Pam?
Uh-Huh.
Go on.
Yeah, tell me about it.
It's the truck, Kramer. The truck!
You wanna know what happened to Kramer? I'll tell you what happened to Kramer. He was ticked off. About the keys. Yeah, that's right - about the keys. Thought he got a bad rap.
Damn!
Alright, let's begin.
Come on, are you ready? Let's go!
Hey, we got ten thousand deposit bottles here. I mean, this guy could be going to Arkansas.
(squeezing himself through the narrow space) Nothing, just being neighborly. Do you wanna hang out? Shoot the breeze?
A second later, something happened that changed us in a deep and profound way front that day forward.
Your Honor, Mister Kramer's obviously very distraught.
(To Jerry) Good night.
(laughing) Oh ho right. Well very nice seeing you folks and a by the way you didn't hear this from me. Tata (runs down the hallway laughing)
Nevertheless, ...
I love.. broccoli, its, good for you.
Son of Sam. The worst mass murderer the post office ever produced.
Wait a minute. You mean you get five cents here, and ten cents there. You could round up bottles here and run 'em out to Michigan for the difference.
All right! All right. I wont say anything.
Cool?
No.
It looks like your breaking into it like an otter breaking into a clad.
No reason.
We had an arguement about me going to Hawaii, and he locked onto my ankle like it was a soup bone. I'm hubbled! I don't think I can do my route - and they're awarding the transfer in two days!
(Sinister) All right, all right. All right you go ahead. You go ahead and keep it secret. But you remember this. When you control the mail, you control... information.
No, that's a fur coat! Hey, uh, give me a boost.
(pushing past Kramer) Kramer, help me! Help me!
Fleas? Bwa ha ha ha ha .That's preposterous. How can I , give you fleas. Now if you don't mind...
Do I smell Pantene?
What are you doing?
Tuesday has no feel. Monday has a feel, Friday has a feel, Sunday has a feel....
We got no one!
Here. Hold this.
You see, it'd been his lifelong dream to be a banker and he uh, just the day before he was turned down by another bank. I believe it was the Manufacturer's Hanover on Lexington and 40th Street. That was the third bank to turn him down so I was-I was a little concerned. I wanted to see how he was doing. Well, Your Honor, he was barely audible. But I distinctly recall him say...
I could give you my uniform from my rookie year.
It's gorgeous water. (pause) Do we own Bermuda?
Clean? Hardly. This looks like a man that isn't happy with his stereo performance.
All my work, my planning, my genius. All for nought.
Blast! There's no way I can handle 8 in addition to my ususal load of one! I'll never get to Hawaii! (Moves over to Jerry's couch, depressed) I'll be stuck in this apartment building forever! (Lays down on Jerry's couch) The dream is dead.
But you never became a banker, did you Mister Kramer? Why? Why did you fail?
Hey, you want me to mail it? I'm on my way out anyway.
You will!
I wanted to, he won't let me.
I don't like it.
How much longer you gonna be, I'm starving here.
Nice place you got here Kramer ...
So, to what do I owe this unusual invitation?
You go.
Yeah. From you.
I'm doing it for you.
Why? I'll tell you why...
Well, ta-ta! (Scampers away.)
Once I find a barber I stick with him. I almost went to barber school. I always felt I had a talent for it.
Work? It's raining.
I'll handle this, Violet. Why don't you take your three hour break? Oh, calm down, everyone. No one's cancelling any mail.
If I'm curt, then I appologize. But as I understand it, we have a situation here and time is of the essence.
What's the matter with you? I just talked to you fifteen minutes ago.
(Stands up and Sputtering loudly) Kramer! I'm with people.
Yes I am, a guy on my mail route just got a couple of tickets and he offered one to me.
(from the corner of the Yogurt shop) Hey, Jerry. Thanks a lot. I hope you're happy.
That guy thought we were a couple of total squares.
You know, those mail bags, they get mighty heavy. I uh, I Nautilus, of course. (puffs out his chest)
Fourty-nine.
Blast!
And then, just as I'm about to go, these boxes show up at the post office with no labels. No labels, Jerry. You know what that means? Freebies!! I got this great mini-TV and a VCR, oh it's unbelievable.
Can I have a bite?
Do we have a deal?
I'm sorry I missed that.
Don't say anything.
Well, you should take a look at my rug then.
Excuse me Miss Weaver, OH! My god it is you! I.. I've seen your show six times..
He's shipping us a rickshaw. It can't miss!
Oh, thank you, sir.
All right, tell it.
Yes thank you. (slams door)
Oh, all the way up.
Where? I..I..I don't see it.
And that failure to become a banker was eating at you. Eating-eating-eating at you inside.
And yet, it's perfectly legal to take a man's soul and crush it out like a stale Pall Mall.
I'll meet you at the coffee shop.
Yeah, me too.
No! That's no reason to kill yourself!
It's entirely possible.
Then I turned and the spit ricochet of him and it hit me.
... a man can really get some thinking done. (sits on couch, next to Kramer.)
Aahh! You're great,It's great, It's so great to see a show that's (looks at Jerry) about something.
We gotta find that rickshaw. You check the sewers and dumpsters. I'll hit the soup kitchens, bakeries, and smorgasbords.
What, do I have to spell it out for ya? He was moving on her like the storm-troopers into Poland.
...Aargh!
Can't do it. I'm on an unbelievable birthday-wish hot streak! My last five birthday wishes came true.
Yeah, I couldn't be sorrier. I uh.
Yes! A more offensive spectacle I cannot recall. Anyway I just really came up to get some detergent.
Hello, Jerry. Will he take it? I gotta go to work.
Hey!! Help me!
Kramer?! Kramer!? Where are you? Kramer!?! Kramer!!?
Bark.
...But, you must promise That you will abide by my decision, no matter how unjust it may seem to either of you. Do I have your word?
Hello Jerry.
Do you really want to know what happened? I'll tell you what Happened. She wasn't my type.
"Do not bend". (Laughs evilly) Just crease, crumple, cram.. you'll do fine. (Phone rings. Newman answers it) Hello?.. This is he. I don't understand.. very well. (Hangs up in disappointment)
Damn you Seinfeld. You useless pustule. Um, somebody's got something on the griddle. maybe it's Kramer.
(Pondering Kramer's plan out loud) They do have an intimate knowledge of the street..
It was your family that pushed you into banking , it was their dream for you...
(mouth full) It's delicious mutton. This is uh, this is outta sight. I would, I would love to get the recipe. It's very good.
What are you doing?
Well, there's very little sleeping going on.
Oh no. No no no no. I bought it from Kramer. He was hard up for cash. Fifty bucks! (he laughs) Can you believe it? Of course, I had to make some minor modifications, you know. Solid tires, reinforced seatpost, heavy duty shocks. But, baby, this is one sweet ride.
(couple quick breaths) Shocking.
I *loathe* you.
Well if you watch closely enough, you just might see me. I'll be the one waving to the camera from my seat on the forty yard line.
Hello Jerry, may I come in?
What do you think? Drive. Drive.
You just got it? Damn, the mail is slow.
HELP! (Elaine enters.)
Right.
Jerry! What could she possibly see in Jerry? (Walks in front of Kramer and trips over his feet.)
I can't believe I'm being evicted.
They're gonna beat me up!
(smugly) That is seven dollars and twenty-two cents better.
[In Kramer's ear] The old coot's sittin' on a mountain of gold!
Never.
(sings) Yes, you're once. Twice. Three times...
Aaaaahhh...!!!
What's the catch?
(reluctant) You don't wanna do your... act, or anything, do you?
Who made you the leader?
You're gyppin' us!
Uh..
Your Honor, I'm only trying to establish Mister Kramer's fragile emotional state, my entire case depends on it.
Great streak of luck I'm having. First, Kramer almost beat me at Risk but I narrowly escaped, and then Tim Whatley gives me his Super Bowl ticket.
Elaine's down there causing all kinds of commotion. Somehow she got a hold of his recipes and she says she's gonna drive him out of business! The Soup Nazi said that now that his recipes are out, he's not gonna make anymore soup! He's moving out of the country, moving to Argentina! No more soup, Jerry! No more for of us!
But Jerry, we've got this new supervisor down at the post office. He's working behind this glass. I know they're talking about me. They're going to transfer me, I know it. Two hours, give me two hours.
My toilet's clogged.
All right, all right. I'll help you but I will except something in return.
Yeah? Well, you bombed! That story stunk worse than these chairs!
I find you extremely ugly.
I have a carpet sweeper you can use.
Yeah, but I though-
ha ha ha Well you know sometimes it just has a way of finding you. Cigarette?
Jerry wouldn't know delicate beauty if it bludgeoned him over the head.
It's about...Elaine.
Hello, Jerry. Say, this yogurt is really something, huh? And it's non-fat! I've been waiting for something like this my whole life! And it's finally here!
You tried it?
You?! (Laughs hysterically) You can't deliver mail!
A radar detector, as I understand it, DETECTS RADAR! WITH A SERIES OF BEEPS AND FLASHING LIGHTS. But oddly, for some reason I didn't hear a thing except for the sound of a police siren.
Oh, Mother's Day. (inspiration strikes) Wait a second. Mother's Day?!
Drop bye anytime, jerry. Hah, ha ha
If we put our three heads together we should come up with something.
You dated her. Give me some inside information. Anything I can use!
Yes, I called you, you idiot! Because you were going to... You were going to... Remember?
Because I don't, never have, anything I read was already open.
It's Thursday.
And, Kramer, you did provide a service in exchange for compensation. But, does the fee, once paid, not entitle the buyer to some assurance Of reliability? Hmm? Huh? Ahh. These were not easy questions to answer. Not for any man...
Oh, can I watch a little? Cuz it's my favorite movie.
That's right.
Well, don't tarry. I'm behind schedule as it is.
Huh.
You are nothing but a piece of crap.
You were going to...
It's okay. A little crooked.
(salivating) Turkey?
Name, please.
You're telling how your parents pushed you into banking.
Is this or is this not your signature?
I know how you feel. For I, too, have a woman for whom I pine.
(Writing on a clipboard) Rusty.
Crazy Joe Davola?
Lucky krauts.
Yes, sir, I believe everything is all squared away. Isn't it, Mr. Kramer?
All right, give me the rope.
(dancing) Can I use your bathroom?
And one more thing. I'm not coming to your party. (exits)
Uh ah (stops her from closing the door; walks in) Having a nice trip? (walks over, grabs a junior mint, smells it then puts it in his pocket)
Can I have a sip?
We're making a trade. I'm giving him my motorcycle helmet - he's giving me his radar detector.
(Urgent) I need that mail, where is it?!
I can't. I'm goin' to a movie.
Five dollars. He offered us *five* dollars.
Well, you'll never guess what happened to me today. I was uh, driving ( Jerry and Kramer turn away) home on the palisades parkway when I looked in the rear view mirror and what did I see? The fuzz. And it's funny because my new radar detector was on. I didn't hear a thing. Isn't that strange?
Well, I'm not paying the five cents for that stupid recycling thing.
Hello Mrs. Seinfeld
Hey, what's up?
Hey Jerry. Look at all the towels they gave me! I really hit the jackpot! (holding a large stack of towels, Newman pats his face with the top one) Ha, ha, ha.
(sings) You're once. Twice. Three times a lady.
Yep.
Yes. It's called mail fraud. Oohhhh. How I've longed for this moment Seinfeld. The day when I would have the proof I needed to hall you out of your cushy lair and expose to the light of justice as the monster that you are. A monster so vile.....
Not really.
Because right now, I'm the only chance you've got. (Newman giggles nervously. Jerry makes Newman flinch, and his giggling is choked off.)
What keeps the water in there? I mean, why doesn't it disappear?
I didn't get my transfer.
What for?
Kramer.
Well for starters I want a calzone of my own.....
Kramer you might as well run along. Jerry might be a while. Suspicion of mail fraud.
Well, it's-it's interesting work, I don't mind it.
Alright, alright, back, savages. Back! I haven't made my wish yet..
(Realizing) Damn!
I took over his route. And boy, were there a lot of dogs on that route.
Well, ELAINE, There's any number of things I could do. But, I can promise you this, though, this vicious beast will never bother you again. So, what's it going to be?
(Intrigued) What are you proposing?
Okay, here it is.
Hello Gina. Hello Jerry.
Minding my own business.
Sorry , last one . Would you want to suck the pit?
Every night I sleep in a really hot room, I don't want to kill myself.
Care for some lemonade?
Well, you know how much those records are worth!?
You emit a foul and unpleasant odour.
(thinking to himself; checks a comb) No. (checks a brush) Jackpot. I don't believe this. There's no hair in this thing. I've never seen a person that didn't have at least one hair in a brush.
They follow him like a cult.
Yuh, yes. I intend to Your Honor. And then, on the afternoon of September 10th, you received a phone call did you not?
Yeah. I just hope Tim Whatley's electric bills don't suddenly get lost in the mail, or it could be lights out for him.
Now, you're that firend. Now, all we need is a reason why you were going to commit suicide.
Yeah, but you pulled him in.
I hope he stays this happy when he wakes up.
Me either.
He cant hear you, you idiot. Why dont you just buy another one.
Jerry?
And then you spit on us.
No sir. He did not. But only by thge grace of God. He's in the courtroom today
It was because you hated your father and you would do anything to displease him. Isn't THAT true?
The Pacific Northwest.
(enters) KEITH HERNANDEZ?
You certainly are in a bind.
Him and his little buxom friend Rachel were going at it pretty good in the balcony.
All right. Bark.
Nevertheless, sometime this afternoon, behind the Market Diner, an unmarked van will be waiting. I'm expecting the call at any time. Are you in?
I despise him.
To prevent an ambush.
What're you doing?
Yea, it's the wood that makes it good.
(to Kramer) You shut up! (to judge) I demand a recess so I can take him outside and help him regain hius composure.
Hey! You're not dumping those bottles back there, are you?
I'm a United States postal worker.
Lately, though, I've been, uh, - I've been buying the generic brand of waxed beans. You know, I rip of the label I can hardly tell the difference.
Excellent. Excellent.
Can't we worry about them later?
Alright, who's first?
There's another way it can go down, and it's going down right now!
You gotta go with me. I mean, you-you're my alibi. You have to take the stand.
No, you can't tell it ..
All right, I'm going to need a clean 8 ounce glass.
Easy, Jerry. Steady. You wouldn't want to lose your cool at a time like this.
He must have caught a glimpse of us when I poured that beer on his head.
Anything else?
(whimpering) Tell the world my story.
Butter. Kramer. Butter. Kramer.
(Gesturing to dishes and silverware on the table) But you can clear some of this stuff out of the way.
Ahaha!
I HAD a girlfriend and she was pretty wild.
Here.
Mind your pace, Boy. Chop, chop!
I'm on the roof!
I don't wanna.
[panting] Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!
Tim Whatley.
(defensive) What're you talking about...
I'm not beaten yet. I still have armies in the Ukraine.
Who's talking to you?
Ill bring him up to date.
No, no, no. That's not gonna work. Something else.
Aaah! Aaagh! Aah-aah. Oh, oh the humanity! Aaagh!
Hello, Jerry.
Hello Jerry.
Not going to play ball. Huh all right. Admit it that stereo was all ready busted.
George?
Don't look at me.
I went through all those bottles and all those cans, for what? What a waste. And I'm really gonna catch hell for those missing mailbags.
That's good stuff, and you can never have too much ice. Alright, I'll tell you what I'll do. You can co-host the party with me, under one condition. No Jerry. Jerry is not invited.
Come on lets go. I got the helmet. Lets get the radar detector.
June 14, 1987.... Mets Phillies. We're enjoying a beautiful afternoon in the right field stands when a crucial Hernandez error to a five run Phillies ninth. Cost the Mets the game.
Hey, don't listen to him. I mean, we can't afford a detour. Our budget won't hold it.
Hey, hey maybe I should go with him?
Hey, we can't follow him, we're going north to Michigan.
Alright. Come back to my party, please.
(perks up) A pie stand? Where?
The reverse peepholes. Silvio said I'm an agitator and I'm out of the building.
Oh, well it's a good thing for Jerry that you didn't go.
I hope you know what you're doing... (Kramer gives Newman a look of lack of confidence)
Sorry. But love is spice with many tastes. A dizzying array of textures...and moments.
You're in trouble, Kramer. I shouldn't even be talking to you, but I'm telling you as a friend. Here's how it's going to happen you may be walking. Maybe on a crisp, autumn day just like today. When a mail truck will slow beside you, and a door will open, and a mailman you know, maybe even trust, will offer to give you a lift.
The guy who had the Hawaii transfer got busted for hoarding Victoria Secret catalogues. I gotta deliver that mail!
South America?! (to Jerry) What kind of snow blower you get us mixed up with?
Me too.
Oh, how I've waited for this moment. But alas, my heart belongs to another man's wife, and I have given the coat to her.
Hello Jerry.
Gotta go. Oh gee, I dropped a nickel (reaches down and picks up the hair.)
Are you crazy?
Sorry. Climbers, keepers.
(Thinks for a moment) I guess you're right. It's just walking around putting it into boxes..
Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry.
I cant eat fruit. It makes me incontinent.
I don't have that kinda dough.
(Realizing he won) Yeah.
(moving away from the counter getting closer to the door) Hello Jerry.
Yes. No, wait! OK, yes.
I don't see any pie...
Yeah, but he's a fighter.
Pantene!
But, on the week before holidays, we see a surge. On alentine's Day, we send two trucks. On Christmas, four, packed to the brim. And tomorrow, if history is any guide, will see some spillover into a fifth truck.
(Negotiating) Your next, fifty wishes.
No, but there's karma, Kramer.
Let's go. Let's go. Move!
I couldn't. I couldn't tell anyone.
Gentlemen, gentlemen. I am so happy to see you both. There is just some inconsistencies I'd like to straighten out.
All right give it to me. let go ...
It's Newman.
Well, I suppose if you got ten car lengths.
Okay.
There will be a small fine.
Wallet.
That smell. It's still with you, huh?
Yes...
( resumes eating) Well that's a shame.
Come on Kramer!
How much gas we got?
Not so fast, Elaine! Only the bike's true owner would rather give it away than see it come to harm. Kramer, the bike is yours!
Mmm. You present an interesting dilemma. Each of you seemingly has a legitimate claim to the bicycle, and yet the bicycle can have only one rightful owner. Quite the conundrum. As a federal employee, I believe the law is all we have. (getting worked up) It's all that separates us from the savages who don't deserve even the privilege of the daily mail. (angry) Stuffing parcels into mailboxes where they don't belong!!...
Hello, Jerry.
Are you sure you know where the impound yard is?
I shoulda gone in with him.
???????
No. I need a really pretty face. But, Hey, that's me.
After you.
You might say that.
(thoughtful) What kind?
It was a cinch. Where are you going?
It was disgusting.
Waaaaahhhh!
Ahhh! Yaaaahhh!
I'm homeless! I'm gonna be out on a street corner, dancing for nickels. I'll be with the hobos in the trainyard, eating out of a bucket.
Ah, don't worry about a thing. In twenty minutes that place'll be swarming with mailmen. We'll be back on the street by lunch.
Olly, olly, oxen, free!
Oh no. Don't tell me. You're gambling again, aren't you? Oh you weak, weak man. Where are you?
(smug) As a matter of fact, I did.
You know, old friend, sometimes I ponder this silly gulf between us and I say, "Why?" Are we really so different. For what is--
It's the romance of the Handsome Cab without the guilt or dander of the equine.
Why I didn't see you at Schindler's List with Jerry.
Hello, boys.
Hello Jerry. (to Kramer) So, any news?
So I sped home to save my friend's life and I was stopped for speeding. Yes, I admit I was speeding but it was to save a man's life. A close friend. An innocent person who wanted nothing more out of life than to love, to be loved and to be a banker.
Well he really seemed to have his hands full if you know what I mean.
Sometimes we don't get what we want.
I think he stealing our rickshaw!
We're practically to Monticello.
Stop it, George, stop it. I was defending your parking.
No.
Okay, you're all set? You got your story?
(Stands up) Too many people go their mail! Close to 80%. No body from the post office has ever cracked the 50% barrier! It's like the 3-minute mile!
Like Silkwood.
A banker! A banker! Your Honor, Your Honor, Your Honor...
Because the mail never stops. It just keeps coming and coming and coming, there's never a let-up. It's relentless. Every day it piles up more and more and more! And you gotta get it out but the more you get it out the more it keeps coming in. And then the bar code reader breaks and it's *Publisher's Clearing House* day!!!
Oooh,
I don't care. It was good. I was enjoying it. Had to interfere. Couldn't leave well enough alone. Well, I will get even with you for this. You can count on it.
Uh, you, uh, you better put something on.
And a slice of pepperoni pizza and a large soda and three times a week I will require a canolie.
This stuff is awful! I'm not Newman!
Hello Jerry.
See'ya later.
Alright then, I guess I can accept a little Jerry, if it gets me a (suggestive) lot of Elaine.
(looking scared) I-it's a it's a...powerful film.
Woah.
Banker! So you're killing yourself because your dreams of becoming a banker have gone unfulfilled. You-you-you-you can't live without being a banker.
(leaving) Oh, by the way, what are you doing for the Super Bowl?
It's Newman.
What d'you mean it doesn't work? You get enough bottles together...
Of course. Take your time. I be here.
I usually do. (Gets up to leave) See ya.
No, no, no, no no. Listen to me. Most days, the post office sends one truckload of mail to the second domestic regional sorting facility in Sagenaw, Michigan.
Right. Kramer, you have to confront Jerry.
I was never that big on creeds.
Well, there is a little something you can do for me...
I knew you'd back out.
It'll be my pleasure.
Of course. Obviously.
(With a gorgeous woman sitting on his lap) Did I?
What the hell was that?
Hello, Jerry. Tim couldn't make it, he's in love. Isn't that wonderful?
I hope you realise what you've done. You've destroyed our whole venture.
All right, so it's me. So what?
That he may be. But he's outta my life, starting in the year two-thousand. For me, the next millennium must be, Jerry-free!
Yes, yes. May I go? Cause I gotta go very badly.
Ah, yes. Forbidden love.
(Cannot take this torture anymore) Baaaaaaaaarrhhhhhhhhhhh....I'm ripped with fleas ( scratches furiously)
What about a guest-host?
Is it?! Ohhh, well if only you'd known, you could have saved some time and given it directly to me! Ha ha ha.
Your nipple's showing.
(seeing postal security officials walking towards Kramer) Quick! Get in!
And therein lies the tragedy. For I believe, sadly for you, that there is but one woman meant for each of us. One perfect angel for whom we are put on this earth.
All right, all right.
All right! But hear me and hear me well - The day will come. Oh yes, mark my words, Seinfeld - your day of reckoning is coming. When an evil wind will blow through your little playworld, and wipe that smug smile off your face. And I'll be there, in all my glory, watching - watching as it all comes crumbling down.
(breaking from his pose) Can I have some gravy?
Oh, that's real.
Why, because I use dental tape?
You lookin' for someone?
(excited) Ooh, my cocoa!
Yeah.
Jerry? I'm a little insulted.
Not so fast pretty boy. There is more to this sorted little affair.
Oh no, no, not the bag!
I did invite you. Your invitation must've gotten ... lost in the mail.
I can't think, there's all this noise.
That was the Vice President of the post office. I didn't get the transfer.. They knew it wasn't me doing my route!
There it is!
Hey, hey...
So what? Do you know whose mailbag that is?
For I am in love with Svetlana, and I don't care if the whole world knows, except for Silvio, who would throw me out of the apartment, where I would be dancing on the sidewalk--
Ohhh!
I use dental tape.
I can't sleep, I tell you! I can't sleep!
(Yelling out to Rusty) Alright, pace yourself, 'Cause you're gonna have to do this all day for very little money.
You know I hear Mr. Steinbrenner can be a bit erratic. I would hate to see him when he's hungry.
(triumph) Let the collecting begin!
From me!
Kramer.
(at the counter) Pair of bear claws please.
An alliance?
Well that's the way it happened.
Hey George, nice hat.
Well you're reneging.
(From outside the room) Kramer? Kramer? (Enters Jerry's bedroom) There you are.
Ah, she just didn't do it for me.
Who?
On my mothers life.
(surprised) Kramer.
Hilarious.
He's giving away what's left! I gotta go home and get a big pot!
Hee hee! Yeah yeah!
Twenty bucks?!? Are you out of your mind?
(to Kramer) You wanna know why you can't go in front first? I'll tell you why. because it signals a breakdown in the social order. Chaos. It reduces us to jungle law.
