I can't. I'm goin' to a movie.
On what?
(Cannot take this torture anymore) Baaaaaaaaarrhhhhhhhhhhh....I'm ripped with fleas ( scratches furiously)
Alright, let's begin.
What're you doing?
Sometimes...
Nice place you got here Kramer ...
Hey! What are you doing? It's after six o'clock! You can't give me a ticket! Hey, you're not gonna get away with this. I'll fight this. I got witnesses.
Yeah, just the way that I was raised. I'm special.
(Realizing) Damn!
Why? I'll tell you why...
Hi. How are you?
Kramer, what the hell are you doing?
Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry.
George?
Kramer.
Son of Sam. The worst mass murderer the post office ever produced.
Mind your pace, Boy. Chop, chop!
I have done nothing unethical.
Lucky krauts.
And, Kramer, you did provide a service in exchange for compensation. But, does the fee, once paid, not entitle the buyer to some assurance Of reliability? Hmm? Huh? Ahh. These were not easy questions to answer. Not for any man...
Yes I am, a guy on my mail route just got a couple of tickets and he offered one to me.
What kind of dog did you say it was?
Well, I suppose if you got ten car lengths.
Hello, Jerry. Say, this yogurt is really something, huh? And it's non-fat! I've been waiting for something like this my whole life! And it's finally here!
Kramer?! Kramer!? Where are you? Kramer!?! Kramer!!?
Hello Mrs. Seinfeld
All my work, my planning, my genius. All for nought.
You gotta go with me. I mean, you-you're my alibi. You have to take the stand.
(simultaneous) No problem. You bet.
See'ya later.
Yeah, but I though-
(to Kramer) You wanna know why you can't go in front first? I'll tell you why. because it signals a breakdown in the social order. Chaos. It reduces us to jungle law.
Look, I don't have time to explain every little thing to you.
Right. Kramer, you have to confront Jerry.
If I'm curt, then I appologize. But as I understand it, we have a situation here and time is of the essence.
Number 67, right here, right here!
Hello Gina. Hello Jerry.
(defensive) What're you talking about...
(Sinister) All right, all right. All right you go ahead. You go ahead and keep it secret. But you remember this. When you control the mail, you control... information.
We got no one!
Kind of. I'm still collecting checks, I'm just not delivering mail.
Huh.
We're practically to Monticello.
Because the mail never stops. It just keeps coming and coming and coming, there's never a let-up. It's relentless. Every day it piles up more and more and more! And you gotta get it out but the more you get it out the more it keeps coming in. And then the bar code reader breaks and it's *Publisher's Clearing House* day!!!
Yeah, sure.
Who?
It's getting cold, it's getting cold.
How much longer you gonna be, I'm starving here.
(leaving) Oh, by the way, what are you doing for the Super Bowl?
The bank. What about your cards and letters?
(reluctant) You don't wanna do your... act, or anything, do you?
...Aargh!
Hello, Jerry.
Well you're reneging.
Oh, Mother's Day. (inspiration strikes) Wait a second. Mother's Day?!
You know Ron's Records down on Bleeker? They pay big cash for used records!
Kramer.
There's no need to get excited. Can't we discuss this like gentlemen?
Don't look at me.
Kramer!
Well, you'll never guess what happened to me today. I was uh, driving ( Jerry and Kramer turn away) home on the palisades parkway when I looked in the rear view mirror and what did I see? The fuzz. And it's funny because my new radar detector was on. I didn't hear a thing. Isn't that strange?
Who is it.
[panting] Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!
What do you think? Drive. Drive.
Pilot? So what do you make for something like that? Fifty? Sixty thousand?
Oooh,
Wow, it was McDowell.
You must!
Oh, thank you, sir.
Gotta go. Oh gee, I dropped a nickel (reaches down and picks up the hair.)
Don't despair, my friend. (Newman walks in front of Kramer and trips over his feet. Again.) I won't allow your love to go unrequited. Not like mine.
(To Jerry) Good night.
I dont care much for the beach. I freckle. . . . Is that a,..
All right, I'm going to need a clean 8 ounce glass.
Pantene!
You know, those mail bags, they get mighty heavy. I uh, I Nautilus, of course. (puffs out his chest)
We had an arguement about me going to Hawaii, and he locked onto my ankle like it was a soup bone. I'm hubbled! I don't think I can do my route - and they're awarding the transfer in two days!
Okay, you're all set? You got your story?
I didn't get my transfer.
Yuh, yes. I intend to Your Honor. And then, on the afternoon of September 10th, you received a phone call did you not?
Nevertheless, sometime this afternoon, behind the Market Diner, an unmarked van will be waiting. I'm expecting the call at any time. Are you in?
Hey, you want me to mail it? I'm on my way out anyway.
Why I didn't see you at Schindler's List with Jerry.
But Jerry, we've got this new supervisor down at the post office. He's working behind this glass. I know they're talking about me. They're going to transfer me, I know it. Two hours, give me two hours.
The Pacific Northwest.
I know how you feel. For I, too, have a woman for whom I pine.
Are you going to give me back that helmet or not?
Help! Help!
Not so fast pretty boy. There is more to this sorted little affair.
(reluctant) You know, I don't really know that much about uh.. I don't have any.. I don't.. I don't think I know much about that.
Hello Jerry.
Hello Jerry, may I come in?
Make us!
Jerry, you better stop her or Ill tell.
Yeah. From you.
Come on, are you ready? Let's go!
Cool?
Ah, she just didn't do it for me.
Come on, let me try it on.
We din, we didn't ... ... Cosmo?
Yeah, but you pulled him in.
You emit a foul and unpleasant odour.
(From outside the room) Kramer? Kramer? (Enters Jerry's bedroom) There you are.
Kramer!!
And why was that?
... a man can really get some thinking done. (sits on couch, next to Kramer.)
Sorry. But love is spice with many tastes. A dizzying array of textures...and moments.
On my mothers life.
Me either.
Blast! There's no way I can handle 8 in addition to my ususal load of one! I'll never get to Hawaii! (Moves over to Jerry's couch, depressed) I'll be stuck in this apartment building forever! (Lays down on Jerry's couch) The dream is dead.
Wallet.
That smell. It's still with you, huh?
I know you know, but you don't know what I know.
Sorry , last one . Would you want to suck the pit?
Look, you said the one in the second courtyard. He was in the second courtyard.
I'm doing it for you.
Gentlemen, gentlemen. I am so happy to see you both. There is just some inconsistencies I'd like to straighten out.
I took over his route. And boy, were there a lot of dogs on that route.
(enters) KEITH HERNANDEZ?
Yes, Yes, now please. Someone, honey mustard.
What're you doing?
Hey, don't listen to him. I mean, we can't afford a detour. Our budget won't hold it.
Well that's the way it happened.
Maybe we could uh, stop for a snack.
No, no, no. That's not gonna work. Something else.
I'm sorry I missed that.
Jerry!
Oh well. Let me perfectly blunt. I don't care for you Costanza. You hang out at the west side of the building with Seinfeld all day and just it up wasting your lives.
(excited) Ooh, my cocoa!
Not so fast, Elaine! Only the bike's true owner would rather give it away than see it come to harm. Kramer, the bike is yours!
I use dental tape.
So I sped home to save my friend's life and I was stopped for speeding. Yes, I admit I was speeding but it was to save a man's life. A close friend. An innocent person who wanted nothing more out of life than to love, to be loved and to be a banker.
To Hawaii. The most sought-after postal route of them all. The air is so dewy-sweet you don't even have to like the stamps.. But it's not to be - So, I'm hanging it up.
It's gorgeous water. (pause) Do we own Bermuda?
Hello jerry. What a pleasant surprise.
Quite frankly, I don't see how it's any of your business.
Well, ELAINE, There's any number of things I could do. But, I can promise you this, though, this vicious beast will never bother you again. So, what's it going to be?
Are you sure you know where the impound yard is?
Thanks buddy. So long he he ...(exits)
You're telling how your parents pushed you into banking.
This stuff is awful! I'm not Newman!
Yeah? Well, you bombed! That story stunk worse than these chairs!
I shoulda gone in with him.
Yeah, tell me about it.
Butter?
Jerry?
You know what I mean.
Pair of bear claws, please.
What the hell was that?
Hello, Jerry.
Well, there's very little sleeping going on.
Hey, what's up?
A radar detector, as I understand it, DETECTS RADAR! WITH A SERIES OF BEEPS AND FLASHING LIGHTS. But oddly, for some reason I didn't hear a thing except for the sound of a police siren.
I like the thick tape.
(thoughtful) What kind?
It was a real melee.
It's entirely possible.
What for, you got your own.
Nevertheless, ...
No.
Can't do it. I'm on an unbelievable birthday-wish hot streak! My last five birthday wishes came true.
Lately, though, I've been, uh, - I've been buying the generic brand of waxed beans. You know, I rip of the label I can hardly tell the difference.
You can't taste 'em . Why waste 'em . Why not give them all to me.
(from the corner of the Yogurt shop) Hey, Jerry. Thanks a lot. I hope you're happy.
Then I turned and the spit ricochet of him and it hit me.
Well sure it would.
I'm leavin'. Jerry's a nut. (Exits)
So, which one of us is gonna pull?
The airport?
Elaine's down there causing all kinds of commotion. Somehow she got a hold of his recipes and she says she's gonna drive him out of business! The Soup Nazi said that now that his recipes are out, he's not gonna make anymore soup! He's moving out of the country, moving to Argentina! No more soup, Jerry! No more for of us!
We'll pay anything. We've got the (hands a wad of money to Kramer) What about Jerry?
Take me! Take me!
(triumphant) Yessss!
Those records are worth more than five dollars!
The guy who had the Hawaii transfer got busted for hoarding Victoria Secret catalogues. I gotta deliver that mail!
Take it or leave it!? We got *Al Jolson* here, *Al Jolson*!!
I told you he was a risk.
(Strangling Kramer) What's the matter with you? We had it all worked out!
Okay.
Butter. Kramer. Butter. Kramer.
You know, old friend, sometimes I ponder this silly gulf between us and I say, "Why?" Are we really so different. For what is--
Him and his little buxom friend Rachel were going at it pretty good in the balcony.
(Stands up and Sputtering loudly) Kramer! I'm with people.
And therein lies the tragedy. For I believe, sadly for you, that there is but one woman meant for each of us. One perfect angel for whom we are put on this earth.
The reverse peepholes. Silvio said I'm an agitator and I'm out of the building.
(surprised) Kramer.
Your Honor, Mister Kramer's obviously very distraught.
Minding my own business.
Just to tell me to keep off the snacks!
I swear.
Yeah.
Gangway!
No, no. I love strong cider. (for the farmer's daughter's benefit) I'm a big, strong, cider guy.
Well, there is a little something you can do for me...
No! That's no reason to kill yourself!
Yeah, but he's a fighter.
Me too.
Hello, Jerry. How's Pam?
(whimpering) Tell the world my story.
I guess there's not much action down there these days.
Okay, here it is.
Alright, alright, back, savages. Back! I haven't made my wish yet..
Uh-Huh.
I have a carpet sweeper you can use.
Alright, go ahead and hit me, Seinfeld. I got witnesses.
Excellent. Excellent.
Name, please.
One large jambalaya, please.
Cancel! (jumps to feet) Think again, longshanks! I started planning this in nineteen seventy-eight. I put a deposit down on that revolving restaurant that overlooks Times Square, and I booked Christopher Cross.
Well he really seemed to have his hands full if you know what I mean.
Of course. Take your time. I be here.
Olly, olly, oxen, free!
You will!
ha ha ha Well you know sometimes it just has a way of finding you. Cigarette?
Not really.
Oh, all the way up.
If you ask me, they have no business living amongst us. Vile, USELESS BEASTS . . .
I did invite you. Your invitation must've gotten ... lost in the mail.
Hello Elaine. Where are they?
(screaming in panic) Aaah!! Aaah!
I love.. broccoli, its, good for you.
I don't understand. You fill an eighteen-wheeler?
Can't we worry about them later?
This isn't about my opening your mail?
Hey, hey...
Yea, it's the wood that makes it good.
So we could put the bottles in a U-haul. You know, go lean and mean?
Ohh, were you there?
(Stands up) Too many people go their mail! Close to 80%. No body from the post office has ever cracked the 50% barrier! It's like the 3-minute mile!
It'll be my pleasure.
He must have caught a glimpse of us when I poured that beer on his head.
Now, you're that firend. Now, all we need is a reason why you were going to commit suicide.
Excuse me Miss Weaver, OH! My god it is you! I.. I've seen your show six times..
Hello Jerry. (to Kramer) So, any news?
Look, sister, go get yourself a cup of coffee, all right? Beat it! (Pushes Elaine out the door and closes it) All right, now here's the lowdown. From a certain connection, I've been able to locate some black market shower heads. They're all made in the former Yugoslavia, and from what I hear the Serbs are fanatic about their showers.
Let's go. Let's go. Move!
Of course. Obviously.
So what? Do you know whose mailbag that is?
You wanna know what happened to Kramer? I'll tell you what happened to Kramer. He was ticked off. About the keys. Yeah, that's right - about the keys. Thought he got a bad rap.
Can I try it on?
Who made you the leader?
I know exactly how he feels. Pleasure doing business with you. Do come again. Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Hey, hey maybe I should go with him?
If we put our three heads together we should come up with something.
How much gas we got?
(Yelling out to Rusty) Alright, pace yourself, 'Cause you're gonna have to do this all day for very little money.
Well, ta-ta! (Scampers away.)
Fleas? Bwa ha ha ha ha .That's preposterous. How can I , give you fleas. Now if you don't mind...
June 14th, 1987. Mets Phillies. You made a big error. Cost the Mets the game. Then you're coming up the parking lot ramp.
Anyway.
Hello Jerry.
Here.
The courthouse. You gotta go with me to the courthouse. I'm contesting a ticket today.
Is it?! Ohhh, well if only you'd known, you could have saved some time and given it directly to me! Ha ha ha.
Never.
I despise him.
(eating) hm.
You gave me a defective detector. ... Jerry?
(to Kramer) You shut up! (to judge) I demand a recess so I can take him outside and help him regain hius composure.
Hey, we can't follow him, we're going north to Michigan.
You go.
An alliance?
Ah, yes. Forbidden love.
You've come at a bad time now. Could you come back later?
Do we have a deal?
Hey Jerry. Look at all the towels they gave me! I really hit the jackpot! (holding a large stack of towels, Newman pats his face with the top one) Ha, ha, ha.
???????
(With a gorgeous woman sitting on his lap) Did I?
Ahaha!
All right. Then let me ask you this. Didn't you find it interesting that your friend had the foresight to purchase postal insurance for your stereo. Huh. I mean parcels are rarely damaged during shipping.
Kramer! Stay left. Left, left, left.
I see many dogs on my mail route. I'll bet there's not one type of mutt or mongrel I haven't run across.
Because I don't, never have, anything I read was already open.
Yes, I called you, you idiot! Because you were going to... You were going to... Remember?
All right. Bark.
What are you doing?
And a slice of pepperoni pizza and a large soda and three times a week I will require a canolie.
(Urgent) I need that mail, where is it?!
And yet, it's perfectly legal to take a man's soul and crush it out like a stale Pall Mall.
(moving away from the counter getting closer to the door) Hello Jerry.
(sings) You're once. Twice. Three times a lady.
I wanted to, he won't let me.
Well why do we have to keep this from Jerry?
Because right now, I'm the only chance you've got. (Newman giggles nervously. Jerry makes Newman flinch, and his giggling is choked off.)
Oh, can I watch a little? Cuz it's my favorite movie.
( resumes eating) Well that's a shame.
Kramer you might as well run along. Jerry might be a while. Suspicion of mail fraud.
I can't eat this.
(Kissing the woman) Beauty .. and brains. (they nuzzle noses)
Can I have a sip?
Well, it's-it's interesting work, I don't mind it.
I don't know, they're deranged.
Hmm, that job sounds like it might be worth a year's free haircuts. And a comb.
There's another way it can go down, and it's going down right now!
Hello Jerry. (to Kramer) What did you say to Elaine? I just got her cancellation in the mail.
(Suggesting Jerry) Does yours?
(Eyes glued to the TV) I guess.
Come on lets go. I got the helmet. Lets get the radar detector.
You must be banker.
(thinking to himself; checks a comb) No. (checks a brush) Jackpot. I don't believe this. There's no hair in this thing. I've never seen a person that didn't have at least one hair in a brush.
It was McDowell.
(Together) Sucker..
Well, I hear it's quite beautiful there this time of year, and of course you know I'm one-quarter French.
No.
You might say that.
Not that!
I can't think, there's all this noise.
...But I have made a decision. (revelatory) We will cut the bike down the middle, and give half to each of you.
I can't believe I'm being evicted.
I hope you realise what you've done. You've destroyed our whole venture.
Coy? I'm not being coy.
From me!
What you need me in the car for?
What makes you think I'm lookin' for trouble?
Hey, hey, hey. (to Jerry) I hear you've got some lip reader working for you. You gotta let me use her for one day. Just one day.
Oh, how I've waited for this moment. But alas, my heart belongs to another man's wife, and I have given the coat to her.
(salivating) Turkey?
Well for starters I want a calzone of my own.....
Crazy Joe Davola?
So, to what do I owe this unusual invitation?
I believe the deal was that I get the calzones on my mail route. Well today I won't be going on my mail route! Will I. Perhaps tomorrow.
Well, h ha ha- if you're happy with her, that's all that matters.
Hee hee! Yeah yeah!
Alright, who's first?
"Do not bend". (Laughs evilly) Just crease, crumple, cram.. you'll do fine. (Phone rings. Newman answers it) Hello?.. This is he. I don't understand.. very well. (Hangs up in disappointment)
I don't have that kinda dough.
Yeah, I couldn't be sorrier. I uh.
(on the phone in his apartment with a Bald head) Not for a while.
Federal employee. Federal employee.
No! And no one will ever see you again!
What's the matter with you? I just talked to you fifteen minutes ago.
Well, don't tarry. I'm behind schedule as it is.
Ah, don't worry about a thing. In twenty minutes that place'll be swarming with mailmen. We'll be back on the street by lunch.
That guy thought we were a couple of total squares.
(Intrigued) What are you proposing?
Not going to play ball. Huh all right. Admit it that stereo was all ready busted.
I don't care. It was good. I was enjoying it. Had to interfere. Couldn't leave well enough alone. Well, I will get even with you for this. You can count on it.
All right, it's true! Of course nobody needs mail. What do you think, you're so clever for figuring that out? But you don't know the half of what goes on here. So just walk away, Kramer. I beg of you.
Yes, sir, I believe everything is all squared away. Isn't it, Mr. Kramer?
A banker! A banker! Your Honor, Your Honor, Your Honor...
Hello. What 's this?
Oh no. Don't tell me. You're gambling again, aren't you? Oh you weak, weak man. Where are you?
I called in sick. I don't work in the rain.
Yeah, I suppose.
It was a cinch. Where are you going?
You were going to...
All right, all right. I'll help you but I will except something in return.
Like Silkwood.
Is this or is this not your signature?
Something's happened with the Soup Nazi!
All right, so it's me. So what?
I cant eat fruit. It makes me incontinent.
Hey Kramer, those have wholesale value! We could cut our losses.
There will be a small fine.
It was your family that pushed you into banking , it was their dream for you...
Well, let me remind you of something. You wouldn't be here if it wasn't for me and my helmet. I saved your life! You would be dead! Dead! You would cease to exist! You would be gone for the rest of eternity! You wouldn't even begin to comprehend what that means!!
Well, it would take a hell of a lot. Because a friend is something you earn.
Where? I..I..I don't see it.
(mouth full) It's delicious mutton. This is uh, this is outta sight. I would, I would love to get the recipe. It's very good.
What d'you mean it doesn't work? You get enough bottles together...
(Pondering Kramer's plan out loud) They do have an intimate knowledge of the street..
(a touch desperate) Ah, look, I..I'm sorry to bother you, but I'm a US postal worker and my mail truck was just ambushed by a band of backwoods mail-hating survivalists.
Are you crazy?
Yeah. Maybe.
A second later, something happened that changed us in a deep and profound way front that day forward.
eue-aaa.
I'll meet you at the coffee shop.
Okay. What is it?
He's giving away what's left! I gotta go home and get a big pot!
(Talking to another man) ...yeah he worked in the cubicle right next to me. We once double dated.
Jerry, George. [To Kramer] So, did you ask him about the records?
Ill bring him up to date.
Damn!
(To his new girlfriend) You see, my dear, all certified mail is registered, but registered mail is not necessarily certified.
(Negotiating) Your next, fifty wishes.
But it's your house.
Aww, c'mon, pull over, pull over will ya.
I don't like it.
I hope he stays this happy when he wakes up.
Tim Whatley.
Why, because I use dental tape?
I went through all those bottles and all those cans, for what? What a waste. And I'm really gonna catch hell for those missing mailbags.
Hey George, nice hat.
Yes, from me!! I called you remember?
Do you really want to know what happened? I'll tell you what Happened. She wasn't my type.
No, no, no, no no. Listen to me. Most days, the post office sends one truckload of mail to the second domestic regional sorting facility in Sagenaw, Michigan.
(excited) We carry a coupla bags of mail, and the rest is ours!
One winsome tulip we ceaselessly yearn for throughout our dreary, workaday lives! And you, my friend, have found your angel. I can tell. For my heart has also been captured by a breathless beauty - whom I fear I will never possess.
Wait a minute. You mean you get five cents here, and ten cents there. You could round up bottles here and run 'em out to Michigan for the difference.
Just one bite?
I *loathe* you.
Yeah, me too.
(pushing past Kramer) Kramer, help me! Help me!
(Gesturing to dishes and silverware on the table) But you can clear some of this stuff out of the way.
This photo clearly indicates your involvement in some ill-conceived mail order pornography ring.As does this one found in the same disturbing packet.
Oh yes, in fact I still have family there. This probably won't interest you, but I have a cousin there who's suffering very badly. She's lost all use of her muscles. She can only communicate by blinking. I would so love to see her - bring a ray of sunshine into her tragic life. But alas, I can't afford it, for I am, as you know, but a simple postal worker.
Jerry! What could she possibly see in Jerry? (Walks in front of Kramer and trips over his feet.)
All right, all right. Go ahead, go ahead.
"Pam." I don't know the woman, but she sounds quite fetching.
Yeah well, the budget changed, you know. I mean, it might be a good investment.
We gotta find that rickshaw. You check the sewers and dumpsters. I'll hit the soup kitchens, bakeries, and smorgasbords.
You are nothing but a piece of crap.
He's shipping us a rickshaw. It can't miss!
Woah.
Fourty-nine.
They follow him like a cult.
Well, you know how much those records are worth!?
Don't you have a-a boyfriend? A, uh, burly, athletic type?
All right. See you later.
Right.
Hello, Jerry. Tim couldn't make it, he's in love. Isn't that wonderful?
Uh..
My toilet's clogged.
Hilarious.
We're making a trade. I'm giving him my motorcycle helmet - he's giving me his radar detector.
You're in trouble, Kramer. I shouldn't even be talking to you, but I'm telling you as a friend. Here's how it's going to happen you may be walking. Maybe on a crisp, autumn day just like today. When a mail truck will slow beside you, and a door will open, and a mailman you know, maybe even trust, will offer to give you a lift.
It looks like your breaking into it like an otter breaking into a clad.
(running out the door) Jerry! Jerry!
Do I smell Pantene?
With your looks and my words, we'll have built the perfect beast. (Kramer claps him on the shoulder, then goes to the other side of the aisle to talk to Pam.)
Ten cents!?
Yes! A more offensive spectacle I cannot recall. Anyway I just really came up to get some detergent.
He cant hear you, you idiot. Why dont you just buy another one.
Clean? Hardly. This looks like a man that isn't happy with his stereo performance.
No. No.
Nah.
That's good stuff, and you can never have too much ice. Alright, I'll tell you what I'll do. You can co-host the party with me, under one condition. No Jerry. Jerry is not invited.
You just got it? Damn, the mail is slow.
I'm homeless! I'm gonna be out on a street corner, dancing for nickels. I'll be with the hobos in the trainyard, eating out of a bucket.
(smug) As a matter of fact, I did.
To the Newmanniun! (holds out his hand)
(Scared) Boy.. Boy. Kramer!
What about your bills?
We had a deal. Are you reneging out of the deal? Are you reneging? That's a renege.
I'm a United States postal worker.
Once I find a barber I stick with him. I almost went to barber school. I always felt I had a talent for it.
(squeezing himself through the narrow space) Nothing, just being neighborly. Do you wanna hang out? Shoot the breeze?
We made quite a haul.
Oh, don't you? Joke boy? You really think you can manipulate that beautiful young woman like the half-soused nightclub rabble that lap up your inane "observations"?
It's about...Elaine.
Drop bye anytime, jerry. Hah, ha ha
[In Kramer's ear] The old coot's sittin' on a mountain of gold!
All right. I'm going in. Keep the motor running.
Frequently.
He's out.
I don't know. The man makes a pretty strong bird.
What about a guest-host?
...it takes just as much man-power to deliver it as their precious little greeting cards...
All right, all right.
Okay, we'll go with the banker story.
Deh!
I wanna learn. I want to know why.
Thank you. [inhaling deeply] Jambalaya!
All right, give me the rope.
Go girl!
Hellooo Jerry. What a rare treat. What brings you down to the east wing?
That was the Vice President of the post office. I didn't get the transfer.. They knew it wasn't me doing my route!
Sorry. Climbers, keepers.
And that failure to become a banker was eating at you. Eating-eating-eating at you inside.
I too am well.
I don't wanna.
Mouth-to-mouth?
Tuesday has no feel. Monday has a feel, Friday has a feel, Sunday has a feel....
Is that Jerry's number?
You lookin' for someone?
It's pretty hot under these lights huh Seinfeld. Pretty....... Hot .
(dancing) Can I use your bathroom?
Well, tootle loo. And nice seeing you again Margaret, goodbye Jerry. Have fun. Hehe
We have some questions we'd like you to answer.
Well, I'm not paying the five cents for that stupid recycling thing.
It's the truck, Kramer. The truck!
Uh, you, uh, you better put something on.
Yes. No, wait! OK, yes.
Hello?
(to Kramer) That's where my missing soda is.
I usually do. (Gets up to leave) See ya.
Yes, a phone call!
Hey, another round of strawberry for me and my friends.
Uh ah (stops her from closing the door; walks in) Having a nice trip? (walks over, grabs a junior mint, smells it then puts it in his pocket)
You're gyppin' us!
Yes, the banker!!!
For I am in love with Svetlana, and I don't care if the whole world knows, except for Silvio, who would throw me out of the apartment, where I would be dancing on the sidewalk--
It's okay. A little crooked.
Twenty bucks?!? Are you out of your mind?
Stop it, George, stop it. I was defending your parking.
Who's talking to you?
It's the romance of the Handsome Cab without the guilt or dander of the equine.
I could give you my uniform from my rookie year.
It was because you hated your father and you would do anything to displease him. Isn't THAT true?
So , you have fleas. Maybe you keep your house in a state of disrepair. Maybe you live in squalor.
Well my girlfriend had one.
Hello, boys.
No, you can't tell it ..
(Writing on a clipboard) Rusty.
Oh the theater. Because I was wondering.
I was never that big on creeds.
It gets my rug clean.
To prevent an ambush.
Care for some lemonade?
No, but there's karma, Kramer.
What are you doing?
I'm on the roof!
I just heard that a postman spotted a rickshaw down in Battery Park.
You certainly are in a bind.
(at the counter) Pair of bear claws please.
(taking bottle) Refund?
All right give it to me. let go ...
South America?! (to Jerry) What kind of snow blower you get us mixed up with?
(Thinks for a moment) I guess you're right. It's just walking around putting it into boxes..
It's Newman.
Hey, what is that up that tree?
Jerry wouldn't know delicate beauty if it bludgeoned him over the head.
But you never became a banker, did you Mister Kramer? Why? Why did you fail?
Uncle Leo? This case is closed pending further evidence. Jerry.
Yep.
What's the catch?
You?! (Laughs hysterically) You can't deliver mail!
(after speeding truck) Kramer!!
What keeps the water in there? I mean, why doesn't it disappear?
I can't sleep, I tell you! I can't sleep!
Oh no, no, not the bag!
That's right.
Yes thank you. (slams door)
(sobbing) I can't afford that!
Hey! You're not dumping those bottles back there, are you?
Mmm. You present an interesting dilemma. Each of you seemingly has a legitimate claim to the bicycle, and yet the bicycle can have only one rightful owner. Quite the conundrum. As a federal employee, I believe the law is all we have. (getting worked up) It's all that separates us from the savages who don't deserve even the privilege of the daily mail. (angry) Stuffing parcels into mailboxes where they don't belong!!...
Aahh! You're great,It's great, It's so great to see a show that's (looks at Jerry) about something.
Reversed?! (Kramer comes hobbling out of the doctors office in pain, after having a vasectomy of his own, and exits. Jerry and Newman look at each other, and bolt for the door themselves.)
Hello Jerry.
You know I hear Mr. Steinbrenner can be a bit erratic. I would hate to see him when he's hungry.
I'll handle this, Violet. Why don't you take your three hour break? Oh, calm down, everyone. No one's cancelling any mail.
Well, you've both presented very convincing arguments. On the one hand, Elaine, your promise was given in haste. But was it not still a promise? Hmm?
No, no I don't like it.
It's Newman.
Ahh! This is very much as I imagined it to be. Aside from this rattan piece, which seems oddly out of place.
Gladly. (starts munching on the broccoli, then spits it out)
Alright, well be back... *jack*!
And then you spit on us.
(sings) Yes, you're once. Twice. Three times...
There it is!
I had gone up to Westchester. I go there every Tuesday. I do charity for the blind in my spare time for the Lighthouse. I was in the middle of a game of Parcheesi with an old blind man and I excused myself to call my friend as he was very depressed lately because he never became a banker.
But, on the week before holidays, we see a surge. On alentine's Day, we send two trucks. On Christmas, four, packed to the brim. And tomorrow, if history is any guide, will see some spillover into a fifth truck.
I think he stealing our rickshaw!
After you.
June 14, 1987.... Mets Phillies. We're enjoying a beautiful afternoon in the right field stands when a crucial Hernandez error to a five run Phillies ninth. Cost the Mets the game.
(breaking from his pose) Can I have some gravy?
I HAD a girlfriend and she was pretty wild.
Well, you should take a look at my rug then.
Here. Hold this.
Will that take care of ours too?
(singing) Nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine bottle and cans in the trunk, nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine bottles and cans. At ten cents a bottle and ten cents a can, we're pulling in five hundred dollars a man. Nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight bottle and cans in the trunk, nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight bottles and cans. We fill up with gas, we count up our cash!!...
That he may be. But he's outta my life, starting in the year two-thousand. For me, the next millennium must be, Jerry-free!
As you were saying, Mister Kramer...
I have a private matter to discuss with my fellow tenants. (Opens door) If you don't mind?
I find you extremely ugly.
What for?
Can I have a bite?
I was speaking earlier with Kramer and he mentioned something about a private jet to Paris?
It was disgusting.
Your Honor, I'm only trying to establish Mister Kramer's fragile emotional state, my entire case depends on it.
Aaah! Aaagh! Aah-aah. Oh, oh the humanity! Aaagh!
(laughing) Oh ho right. Well very nice seeing you folks and a by the way you didn't hear this from me. Tata (runs down the hallway laughing)
Don't say anything.
Yeah. I just hope Tim Whatley's electric bills don't suddenly get lost in the mail, or it could be lights out for him.
Jerry? I'm a little insulted.
Hello Jerry. Well, I may have a solution to our little problem. Elaine, would you excuse us?
No sir. He did not. But only by thge grace of God. He's in the courtroom today
You heard me. So he packed it up and split for the coast. La-La Land. L.A.
Yes...
...But, you must promise That you will abide by my decision, no matter how unjust it may seem to either of you. Do I have your word?
I couldn't. I couldn't tell anyone.
What, do I have to spell it out for ya? He was moving on her like the storm-troopers into Poland.
(peering at bottle label) What is this 'MI, ten cents'?
Are you married right now? (points at Jerry)
He did it right in this bed, Martin. Right in front of you.
Yes. It's called mail fraud. Oohhhh. How I've longed for this moment Seinfeld. The day when I would have the proof I needed to hall you out of your cushy lair and expose to the light of justice as the monster that you are. A monster so vile.....
All right! But hear me and hear me well - The day will come. Oh yes, mark my words, Seinfeld - your day of reckoning is coming. When an evil wind will blow through your little playworld, and wipe that smug smile off your face. And I'll be there, in all my glory, watching - watching as it all comes crumbling down.
Well, it's her mistake. Because she is going to miss the party of a lifetime.
And then, just as I'm about to go, these boxes show up at the post office with no labels. No labels, Jerry. You know what that means? Freebies!! I got this great mini-TV and a VCR, oh it's unbelievable.
Use me for what?
It's Thursday.
No reason.
Kramer bit me!
(couple quick breaths) Shocking.
Yes, yes. May I go? Cause I gotta go very badly.
I WANT MY HELMET BACK! GIVE ME BACK MY HELMET AND YOU'RE GOING TO PAY FOR THAT TICKET.
I don't see any pie...
Go on.
No, that's a fur coat! Hey, uh, give me a boost.
You dated her. Give me some inside information. Anything I can use!
(sobbing) Yes, it's been awful. I wanted to tell somebody. (pleading) Help me Kramer! Help me!
Hey, you know this is kind of fun.
All right! All right. I wont say anything.
