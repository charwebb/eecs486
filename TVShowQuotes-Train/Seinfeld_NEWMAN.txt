The bank. What about your cards and letters?
He cant hear you, you idiot. Why dont you just buy another one.
South America?! (to Jerry) What kind of snow blower you get us mixed up with?
No, no, no. That's not gonna work. Something else.
Gentlemen, gentlemen. I am so happy to see you both. There is just some inconsistencies I'd like to straighten out.
Hey Kramer, those have wholesale value! We could cut our losses.
I HAD a girlfriend and she was pretty wild.
I took over his route. And boy, were there a lot of dogs on that route.
Oh no. No no no no. I bought it from Kramer. He was hard up for cash. Fifty bucks! (he laughs) Can you believe it? Of course, I had to make some minor modifications, you know. Solid tires, reinforced seatpost, heavy duty shocks. But, baby, this is one sweet ride.
You wanna know what happened to Kramer? I'll tell you what happened to Kramer. He was ticked off. About the keys. Yeah, that's right - about the keys. Thought he got a bad rap.
That he may be. But he's outta my life, starting in the year two-thousand. For me, the next millennium must be, Jerry-free!
Ahh! This is very much as I imagined it to be. Aside from this rattan piece, which seems oddly out of place.
We had an arguement about me going to Hawaii, and he locked onto my ankle like it was a soup bone. I'm hubbled! I don't think I can do my route - and they're awarding the transfer in two days!
"Do not bend". (Laughs evilly) Just crease, crumple, cram.. you'll do fine. (Phone rings. Newman answers it) Hello?.. This is he. I don't understand.. very well. (Hangs up in disappointment)
Well, you should take a look at my rug then.
I'll handle this, Violet. Why don't you take your three hour break? Oh, calm down, everyone. No one's cancelling any mail.
One winsome tulip we ceaselessly yearn for throughout our dreary, workaday lives! And you, my friend, have found your angel. I can tell. For my heart has also been captured by a breathless beauty - whom I fear I will never possess.
Well, it's-it's interesting work, I don't mind it.
Well, tootle loo. And nice seeing you again Margaret, goodbye Jerry. Have fun. Hehe
But you never became a banker, did you Mister Kramer? Why? Why did you fail?
Hey, another round of strawberry for me and my friends.
Hey, we got ten thousand deposit bottles here. I mean, this guy could be going to Arkansas.
The mother of all mail days. And guess who signed up for the truck.
What kind of dog did you say it was?
(Gesturing to dishes and silverware on the table) But you can clear some of this stuff out of the way.
Once I find a barber I stick with him. I almost went to barber school. I always felt I had a talent for it.
There's another way it can go down, and it's going down right now!
I usually do. (Gets up to leave) See ya.
Stop it, George, stop it. I was defending your parking.
If we put our three heads together we should come up with something.
Jerry! What could she possibly see in Jerry? (Walks in front of Kramer and trips over his feet.)
For I am in love with Svetlana, and I don't care if the whole world knows, except for Silvio, who would throw me out of the apartment, where I would be dancing on the sidewalk--
(Stands up and Sputtering loudly) Kramer! I'm with people.
Clean? Hardly. This looks like a man that isn't happy with his stereo performance.
June 14th, 1987. Mets Phillies. You made a big error. Cost the Mets the game. Then you're coming up the parking lot ramp.
(To Rusty) Alright, uh, take it down to the end of the block. Make a controlled turn, and bring her back. Let's see what you've got! Ok? Ready, and go!
Hey Jerry. Look at all the towels they gave me! I really hit the jackpot! (holding a large stack of towels, Newman pats his face with the top one) Ha, ha, ha.
Aahh! You're great,It's great, It's so great to see a show that's (looks at Jerry) about something.
Every night I sleep in a really hot room, I don't want to kill myself.
Jerry, George. [To Kramer] So, did you ask him about the records?
(smug) As a matter of fact, I did.
What d'you mean it doesn't work? You get enough bottles together...
Oh, don't you? Joke boy? You really think you can manipulate that beautiful young woman like the half-soused nightclub rabble that lap up your inane "observations"?
All right. I'm going in. Keep the motor running.
Hello, Jerry. Say, this yogurt is really something, huh? And it's non-fat! I've been waiting for something like this my whole life! And it's finally here!
You know, those mail bags, they get mighty heavy. I uh, I Nautilus, of course. (puffs out his chest)
And that failure to become a banker was eating at you. Eating-eating-eating at you inside.
You're in trouble, Kramer. I shouldn't even be talking to you, but I'm telling you as a friend. Here's how it's going to happen you may be walking. Maybe on a crisp, autumn day just like today. When a mail truck will slow beside you, and a door will open, and a mailman you know, maybe even trust, will offer to give you a lift.
All right! All right. I wont say anything.
(reluctant) You know, I don't really know that much about uh.. I don't have any.. I don't.. I don't think I know much about that.
Yes I am, a guy on my mail route just got a couple of tickets and he offered one to me.
He's giving away what's left! I gotta go home and get a big pot!
Yuh, yes. I intend to Your Honor. And then, on the afternoon of September 10th, you received a phone call did you not?
(smugly) That is seven dollars and twenty-two cents better.
I know how you feel. For I, too, have a woman for whom I pine.
No sir. He did not. But only by thge grace of God. He's in the courtroom today
Hey, you want me to mail it? I'm on my way out anyway.
Mmm. You present an interesting dilemma. Each of you seemingly has a legitimate claim to the bicycle, and yet the bicycle can have only one rightful owner. Quite the conundrum. As a federal employee, I believe the law is all we have. (getting worked up) It's all that separates us from the savages who don't deserve even the privilege of the daily mail. (angry) Stuffing parcels into mailboxes where they don't belong!!...
(excited) We carry a coupla bags of mail, and the rest is ours!
So I sped home to save my friend's life and I was stopped for speeding. Yes, I admit I was speeding but it was to save a man's life. A close friend. An innocent person who wanted nothing more out of life than to love, to be loved and to be a banker.
I can't sleep, I tell you! I can't sleep!
You can't taste 'em . Why waste 'em . Why not give them all to me.
Oh yes, in fact I still have family there. This probably won't interest you, but I have a cousin there who's suffering very badly. She's lost all use of her muscles. She can only communicate by blinking. I would so love to see her - bring a ray of sunshine into her tragic life. But alas, I can't afford it, for I am, as you know, but a simple postal worker.
But Jerry, we've got this new supervisor down at the post office. He's working behind this glass. I know they're talking about me. They're going to transfer me, I know it. Two hours, give me two hours.
(on the phone in his apartment with a Bald head) Not for a while.
Lately, though, I've been, uh, - I've been buying the generic brand of waxed beans. You know, I rip of the label I can hardly tell the difference.
Jerry, you better stop her or Ill tell.
Well, it's her mistake. Because she is going to miss the party of a lifetime.
You gotta go with me. I mean, you-you're my alibi. You have to take the stand.
When the cop stopped me, I told him that I was rushing home because my friend was about to commit suicide.
No, no, no, no no. Listen to me. Most days, the post office sends one truckload of mail to the second domestic regional sorting facility in Sagenaw, Michigan.
A second later, something happened that changed us in a deep and profound way front that day forward.
(to Kramer) That's where my missing soda is.
The reverse peepholes. Silvio said I'm an agitator and I'm out of the building.
Don't you have a-a boyfriend? A, uh, burly, athletic type?
Oh, well it's a good thing for Jerry that you didn't go.
We're making a trade. I'm giving him my motorcycle helmet - he's giving me his radar detector.
Kind of. I'm still collecting checks, I'm just not delivering mail.
(laughing) Oh ho right. Well very nice seeing you folks and a by the way you didn't hear this from me. Tata (runs down the hallway laughing)
A radar detector, as I understand it, DETECTS RADAR! WITH A SERIES OF BEEPS AND FLASHING LIGHTS. But oddly, for some reason I didn't hear a thing except for the sound of a police siren.
Well, I suppose if you got ten car lengths.
...But I have made a decision. (revelatory) We will cut the bike down the middle, and give half to each of you.
Hellooo Jerry. What a rare treat. What brings you down to the east wing?
Yes, yes. May I go? Cause I gotta go very badly.
Because the mail never stops. It just keeps coming and coming and coming, there's never a let-up. It's relentless. Every day it piles up more and more and more! And you gotta get it out but the more you get it out the more it keeps coming in. And then the bar code reader breaks and it's *Publisher's Clearing House* day!!!
Now, you're that firend. Now, all we need is a reason why you were going to commit suicide.
I believe the deal was that I get the calzones on my mail route. Well today I won't be going on my mail route! Will I. Perhaps tomorrow.
All right, it's true! Of course nobody needs mail. What do you think, you're so clever for figuring that out? But you don't know the half of what goes on here. So just walk away, Kramer. I beg of you.
Yes, sir, I believe everything is all squared away. Isn't it, Mr. Kramer?
Uh ah (stops her from closing the door; walks in) Having a nice trip? (walks over, grabs a junior mint, smells it then puts it in his pocket)
To Hawaii. The most sought-after postal route of them all. The air is so dewy-sweet you don't even have to like the stamps.. But it's not to be - So, I'm hanging it up.
All right, all right. I'll help you but I will except something in return.
(To his new girlfriend) You see, my dear, all certified mail is registered, but registered mail is not necessarily certified.
Well, you've both presented very convincing arguments. On the one hand, Elaine, your promise was given in haste. But was it not still a promise? Hmm?
I dont care much for the beach. I freckle. . . . Is that a,..
Gotta go. Oh gee, I dropped a nickel (reaches down and picks up the hair.)
(With a gorgeous woman sitting on his lap) Did I?
You see, it'd been his lifelong dream to be a banker and he uh, just the day before he was turned down by another bank. I believe it was the Manufacturer's Hanover on Lexington and 40th Street. That was the third bank to turn him down so I was-I was a little concerned. I wanted to see how he was doing. Well, Your Honor, he was barely audible. But I distinctly recall him say...
Oh, how I've waited for this moment. But alas, my heart belongs to another man's wife, and I have given the coat to her.
Because I don't, never have, anything I read was already open.
So, to what do I owe this unusual invitation?
Not so fast, Elaine! Only the bike's true owner would rather give it away than see it come to harm. Kramer, the bike is yours!
That guy thought we were a couple of total squares.
(Thinks for a moment) I guess you're right. It's just walking around putting it into boxes..
All my work, my planning, my genius. All for nought.
I have a private matter to discuss with my fellow tenants. (Opens door) If you don't mind?
Those records are worth more than five dollars!
It was a cinch. Where are you going?
(at the counter) Pair of bear claws please.
And one more thing. I'm not coming to your party. (exits)
No, no. I love strong cider. (for the farmer's daughter's benefit) I'm a big, strong, cider guy.
Come on lets go. I got the helmet. Lets get the radar detector.
(from the corner of the Yogurt shop) Hey, Jerry. Thanks a lot. I hope you're happy.
June 14, 1987.... Mets Phillies. We're enjoying a beautiful afternoon in the right field stands when a crucial Hernandez error to a five run Phillies ninth. Cost the Mets the game.
Great streak of luck I'm having. First, Kramer almost beat me at Risk but I narrowly escaped, and then Tim Whatley gives me his Super Bowl ticket.
You're telling how your parents pushed you into banking.
Damn you Seinfeld. You useless pustule. Um, somebody's got something on the griddle. maybe it's Kramer.
How much longer you gonna be, I'm starving here.
I wanna learn. I want to know why.
No! And no one will ever see you again!
You know, when you think about it, it's kind of silly for us both to pull this thing all t he way back uptown. I mean, after all, it is a conveyance.
Sorry. But love is spice with many tastes. A dizzying array of textures...and moments.
...But, you must promise That you will abide by my decision, no matter how unjust it may seem to either of you. Do I have your word?
Alright then, I guess I can accept a little Jerry, if it gets me a (suggestive) lot of Elaine.
Then I turned and the spit ricochet of him and it hit me.
Well, there is a little something you can do for me...
Yeah. I just hope Tim Whatley's electric bills don't suddenly get lost in the mail, or it could be lights out for him.
Easy, Jerry. Steady. You wouldn't want to lose your cool at a time like this.
If I'm curt, then I appologize. But as I understand it, we have a situation here and time is of the essence.
Aww, c'mon, pull over, pull over will ya.
I see many dogs on my mail route. I'll bet there's not one type of mutt or mongrel I haven't run across.
You gave me a defective detector. ... Jerry?
And, Kramer, you did provide a service in exchange for compensation. But, does the fee, once paid, not entitle the buyer to some assurance Of reliability? Hmm? Huh? Ahh. These were not easy questions to answer. Not for any man...
Well, I hear it's quite beautiful there this time of year, and of course you know I'm one-quarter French.
(squeezing himself through the narrow space) Nothing, just being neighborly. Do you wanna hang out? Shoot the breeze?
You dated her. Give me some inside information. Anything I can use!
Okay, you're all set? You got your story?
You heard me. So he packed it up and split for the coast. La-La Land. L.A.
Well if you watch closely enough, you just might see me. I'll be the one waving to the camera from my seat on the forty yard line.
"Pam." I don't know the woman, but she sounds quite fetching.
No. I need a really pretty face. But, Hey, that's me.
Hmm, that job sounds like it might be worth a year's free haircuts. And a comb.
Well, I wouldn't hear of it. I said, "Nice try, granny!" And I sent her to the back of the line!
You know I hear Mr. Steinbrenner can be a bit erratic. I would hate to see him when he's hungry.
(singing) Nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine bottle and cans in the trunk, nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine bottles and cans. At ten cents a bottle and ten cents a can, we're pulling in five hundred dollars a man. Nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight bottle and cans in the trunk, nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight bottles and cans. We fill up with gas, we count up our cash!!...
Yes! A more offensive spectacle I cannot recall. Anyway I just really came up to get some detergent.
(Kissing the woman) Beauty .. and brains. (they nuzzle noses)
Yeah, just the way that I was raised. I'm special.
(breaking from his pose) Can I have some gravy?
... a man can really get some thinking done. (sits on couch, next to Kramer.)
I did invite you. Your invitation must've gotten ... lost in the mail.
Well, h ha ha- if you're happy with her, that's all that matters.
Because right now, I'm the only chance you've got. (Newman giggles nervously. Jerry makes Newman flinch, and his giggling is choked off.)
I could give you my uniform from my rookie year.
(moving away from the counter getting closer to the door) Hello Jerry.
I hope you know what you're doing... (Kramer gives Newman a look of lack of confidence)
Nevertheless, sometime this afternoon, behind the Market Diner, an unmarked van will be waiting. I'm expecting the call at any time. Are you in?
There's no need to get excited. Can't we discuss this like gentlemen?
Kramer you might as well run along. Jerry might be a while. Suspicion of mail fraud.
Jerry wouldn't know delicate beauty if it bludgeoned him over the head.
What keeps the water in there? I mean, why doesn't it disappear?
It was because you hated your father and you would do anything to displease him. Isn't THAT true?
Hello Jerry. Well, I may have a solution to our little problem. Elaine, would you excuse us?
(Yelling out to Rusty) Alright, pace yourself, 'Cause you're gonna have to do this all day for very little money.
Can't do it. I'm on an unbelievable birthday-wish hot streak! My last five birthday wishes came true.
I'm not beaten yet. I still have armies in the Ukraine.
[In Kramer's ear] The old coot's sittin' on a mountain of gold!
I just heard that a postman spotted a rickshaw down in Battery Park.
What you need me in the car for?
All right, I'm going to need a clean 8 ounce glass.
Is this or is this not your signature?
Alright, alright, back, savages. Back! I haven't made my wish yet..
And yet, it's perfectly legal to take a man's soul and crush it out like a stale Pall Mall.
Blast! There's no way I can handle 8 in addition to my ususal load of one! I'll never get to Hawaii! (Moves over to Jerry's couch, depressed) I'll be stuck in this apartment building forever! (Lays down on Jerry's couch) The dream is dead.
Your Honor, I'm only trying to establish Mister Kramer's fragile emotional state, my entire case depends on it.
What's the matter with you? I just talked to you fifteen minutes ago.
Not going to play ball. Huh all right. Admit it that stereo was all ready busted.
Well, I'm not paying the five cents for that stupid recycling thing.
Hey, don't listen to him. I mean, we can't afford a detour. Our budget won't hold it.
(to Kramer) You shut up! (to judge) I demand a recess so I can take him outside and help him regain hius composure.
Do you really want to know what happened? I'll tell you what Happened. She wasn't my type.
Elaine's down there causing all kinds of commotion. Somehow she got a hold of his recipes and she says she's gonna drive him out of business! The Soup Nazi said that now that his recipes are out, he's not gonna make anymore soup! He's moving out of the country, moving to Argentina! No more soup, Jerry! No more for of us!
Well, it would take a hell of a lot. Because a friend is something you earn.
Cancel! (jumps to feet) Think again, longshanks! I started planning this in nineteen seventy-eight. I put a deposit down on that revolving restaurant that overlooks Times Square, and I booked Christopher Cross.
It's gorgeous water. (pause) Do we own Bermuda?
Sorry , last one . Would you want to suck the pit?
Not so fast pretty boy. There is more to this sorted little affair.
I know you know, but you don't know what I know.
I cant eat fruit. It makes me incontinent.
This photo clearly indicates your involvement in some ill-conceived mail order pornography ring.As does this one found in the same disturbing packet.
Well, let me remind you of something. You wouldn't be here if it wasn't for me and my helmet. I saved your life! You would be dead! Dead! You would cease to exist! You would be gone for the rest of eternity! You wouldn't even begin to comprehend what that means!!
Oh, can I watch a little? Cuz it's my favorite movie.
And therein lies the tragedy. For I believe, sadly for you, that there is but one woman meant for each of us. One perfect angel for whom we are put on this earth.
Take it or leave it!? We got *Al Jolson* here, *Al Jolson*!!
I know exactly how he feels. Pleasure doing business with you. Do come again. Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Reversed?! (Kramer comes hobbling out of the doctors office in pain, after having a vasectomy of his own, and exits. Jerry and Newman look at each other, and bolt for the door themselves.)
Banker! So you're killing yourself because your dreams of becoming a banker have gone unfulfilled. You-you-you-you can't live without being a banker.
I have a carpet sweeper you can use.
(Pondering Kramer's plan out loud) They do have an intimate knowledge of the street..
(Cannot take this torture anymore) Baaaaaaaaarrhhhhhhhhhhh....I'm ripped with fleas ( scratches furiously)
You know Ron's Records down on Bleeker? They pay big cash for used records!
(leaving) Oh, by the way, what are you doing for the Super Bowl?
Yes. It's called mail fraud. Oohhhh. How I've longed for this moment Seinfeld. The day when I would have the proof I needed to hall you out of your cushy lair and expose to the light of justice as the monster that you are. A monster so vile.....
A banker! A banker! Your Honor, Your Honor, Your Honor...
Fleas? Bwa ha ha ha ha .That's preposterous. How can I , give you fleas. Now if you don't mind...
(seeing postal security officials walking towards Kramer) Quick! Get in!
Hello Jerry. (to Kramer) What did you say to Elaine? I just got her cancellation in the mail.
I had gone up to Westchester. I go there every Tuesday. I do charity for the blind in my spare time for the Lighthouse. I was in the middle of a game of Parcheesi with an old blind man and I excused myself to call my friend as he was very depressed lately because he never became a banker.
I don't know. The man makes a pretty strong bird.
Yeah well, the budget changed, you know. I mean, it might be a good investment.
It looks like your breaking into it like an otter breaking into a clad.
Look, sister, go get yourself a cup of coffee, all right? Beat it! (Pushes Elaine out the door and closes it) All right, now here's the lowdown. From a certain connection, I've been able to locate some black market shower heads. They're all made in the former Yugoslavia, and from what I hear the Serbs are fanatic about their showers.
Hey! What are you doing? It's after six o'clock! You can't give me a ticket! Hey, you're not gonna get away with this. I'll fight this. I got witnesses.
Quite frankly, I don't see how it's any of your business.
Exactly. You're a disgrace to the uniform. (Newman takes off Jerry's mailman hat. Jerry turns his head in shame. Newman then tears the post office badge from Jerry's coat)
It's pretty hot under these lights huh Seinfeld. Pretty....... Hot .
I went through all those bottles and all those cans, for what? What a waste. And I'm really gonna catch hell for those missing mailbags.
Just to tell me to keep off the snacks!
Well why do we have to keep this from Jerry?
(Sinister) All right, all right. All right you go ahead. You go ahead and keep it secret. But you remember this. When you control the mail, you control... information.
(Strangling Kramer) What's the matter with you? We had it all worked out!
Well, ELAINE, There's any number of things I could do. But, I can promise you this, though, this vicious beast will never bother you again. So, what's it going to be?
Yes, I called you, you idiot! Because you were going to... You were going to... Remember?
He did it right in this bed, Martin. Right in front of you.
Of course. Take your time. I be here.
No, that's a fur coat! Hey, uh, give me a boost.
But, on the week before holidays, we see a surge. On alentine's Day, we send two trucks. On Christmas, four, packed to the brim. And tomorrow, if history is any guide, will see some spillover into a fifth truck.
It's the romance of the Handsome Cab without the guilt or dander of the equine.
(Urgent) I need that mail, where is it?!
All right! But hear me and hear me well - The day will come. Oh yes, mark my words, Seinfeld - your day of reckoning is coming. When an evil wind will blow through your little playworld, and wipe that smug smile off your face. And I'll be there, in all my glory, watching - watching as it all comes crumbling down.
(peering at bottle label) What is this 'MI, ten cents'?
I don't care. It was good. I was enjoying it. Had to interfere. Couldn't leave well enough alone. Well, I will get even with you for this. You can count on it.
(pushing past Kramer) Kramer, help me! Help me!
Alright, go ahead and hit me, Seinfeld. I got witnesses.
Gladly. (starts munching on the broccoli, then spits it out)
The guy who had the Hawaii transfer got busted for hoarding Victoria Secret catalogues. I gotta deliver that mail!
Is it?! Ohhh, well if only you'd known, you could have saved some time and given it directly to me! Ha ha ha.
(thinking to himself; checks a comb) No. (checks a brush) Jackpot. I don't believe this. There's no hair in this thing. I've never seen a person that didn't have at least one hair in a brush.
Twenty bucks?!? Are you out of your mind?
Are you married right now? (points at Jerry)
(Stands up) Too many people go their mail! Close to 80%. No body from the post office has ever cracked the 50% barrier! It's like the 3-minute mile!
Well, don't tarry. I'm behind schedule as it is.
All right, all right. Go ahead, go ahead.
Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry.
Don't despair, my friend. (Newman walks in front of Kramer and trips over his feet. Again.) I won't allow your love to go unrequited. Not like mine.
I called in sick. I don't work in the rain.
Hello, Jerry. Will he take it? I gotta go to work.
Well he really seemed to have his hands full if you know what I mean.
What makes you think I'm lookin' for trouble?
Hey, you know this is kind of fun.
Well for starters I want a calzone of my own.....
You just got it? Damn, the mail is slow.
Are you going to give me back that helmet or not?
With your looks and my words, we'll have built the perfect beast. (Kramer claps him on the shoulder, then goes to the other side of the aisle to talk to Pam.)
That was the Vice President of the post office. I didn't get the transfer.. They knew it wasn't me doing my route!
All right give it to me. let go ...
Pilot? So what do you make for something like that? Fifty? Sixty thousand?
Hey, we can't follow him, we're going north to Michigan.
Wait a minute. You mean you get five cents here, and ten cents there. You could round up bottles here and run 'em out to Michigan for the difference.
I'm homeless! I'm gonna be out on a street corner, dancing for nickels. I'll be with the hobos in the trainyard, eating out of a bucket.
He must have caught a glimpse of us when I poured that beer on his head.
He's shipping us a rickshaw. It can't miss!
You know, old friend, sometimes I ponder this silly gulf between us and I say, "Why?" Are we really so different. For what is--
Look, you said the one in the second courtyard. He was in the second courtyard.
I hope he stays this happy when he wakes up.
Maybe we could uh, stop for a snack.
And then, just as I'm about to go, these boxes show up at the post office with no labels. No labels, Jerry. You know what that means? Freebies!! I got this great mini-TV and a VCR, oh it's unbelievable.
Hey! You're not dumping those bottles back there, are you?
Ah, don't worry about a thing. In twenty minutes that place'll be swarming with mailmen. We'll be back on the street by lunch.
I was speaking earlier with Kramer and he mentioned something about a private jet to Paris?
What, do I have to spell it out for ya? He was moving on her like the storm-troopers into Poland.
(sings) You're once. Twice. Three times a lady.
It was your family that pushed you into banking , it was their dream for you...
Tuesday has no feel. Monday has a feel, Friday has a feel, Sunday has a feel....
(mouth full) It's delicious mutton. This is uh, this is outta sight. I would, I would love to get the recipe. It's very good.
Look, I don't have time to explain every little thing to you.
Oh well. Let me perfectly blunt. I don't care for you Costanza. You hang out at the west side of the building with Seinfeld all day and just it up wasting your lives.
We have some questions we'd like you to answer.
Yeah? Well, you bombed! That story stunk worse than these chairs!
So , you have fleas. Maybe you keep your house in a state of disrepair. Maybe you live in squalor.
Are you sure you know where the impound yard is?
Him and his little buxom friend Rachel were going at it pretty good in the balcony.
All right. Then let me ask you this. Didn't you find it interesting that your friend had the foresight to purchase postal insurance for your stereo. Huh. I mean parcels are rarely damaged during shipping.
I hope you realise what you've done. You've destroyed our whole venture.
...it takes just as much man-power to deliver it as their precious little greeting cards...
That's good stuff, and you can never have too much ice. Alright, I'll tell you what I'll do. You can co-host the party with me, under one condition. No Jerry. Jerry is not invited.
Ah, she just didn't do it for me.
Excuse me Miss Weaver, OH! My god it is you! I.. I've seen your show six times..
Aaah! Aaagh! Aah-aah. Oh, oh the humanity! Aaagh!
Uncle Leo? This case is closed pending further evidence. Jerry.
