South America?! (to Jerry) What kind of snow blower you get us mixed up with?
Vile weed!
I see many dogs on my mail route. I'll bet there's not one type of mutt or mongrel I haven't run across.
A piece of crap.
I can't eat this.
You know Ron's Records down on Bleeker? They pay big cash for used records!
Oh no. No no no no. I bought it from Kramer. He was hard up for cash. Fifty bucks! (he laughs) Can you believe it? Of course, I had to make some minor modifications, you know. Solid tires, reinforced seatpost, heavy duty shocks. But, baby, this is one sweet ride.
(on the phone in his apartment with a Bald head) Not for a while.
(With a gorgeous woman sitting on his lap) Did I?
Nice place you got here Kramer ...
But you never became a banker, did you Mister Kramer? Why? Why did you fail?
Twenty bucks?!? Are you out of your mind?
Aww, c'mon, pull over, pull over will ya.
I swear.
Not going to play ball. Huh all right. Admit it that stereo was all ready busted.
I'm homeless! I'm gonna be out on a street corner, dancing for nickels. I'll be with the hobos in the trainyard, eating out of a bucket.
You are?
Elaine's down there causing all kinds of commotion. Somehow she got a hold of his recipes and she says she's gonna drive him out of business! The Soup Nazi said that now that his recipes are out, he's not gonna make anymore soup! He's moving out of the country, moving to Argentina! No more soup, Jerry! No more for of us!
Hello. What 's this?
Gangway!
Well, there's very little sleeping going on.
"Do not bend". (Laughs evilly) Just crease, crumple, cram.. you'll do fine. (Phone rings. Newman answers it) Hello?.. This is he. I don't understand.. very well. (Hangs up in disappointment)
He cant hear you, you idiot. Why dont you just buy another one.
Well, you should take a look at my rug then.
I have done nothing unethical.
No! That's no reason to kill yourself!
Number 67, right here, right here!
What're you doing?
Because right now, I'm the only chance you've got. (Newman giggles nervously. Jerry makes Newman flinch, and his giggling is choked off.)
As you were saying, Mister Kramer...
You gave me a defective detector. ... Jerry?
Of course. Obviously.
Will that take care of ours too?
What you need me in the car for?
All right give it to me. let go ...
All right, so it's me. So what?
Oh, well it's a good thing for Jerry that you didn't go.
You tried it?
It's Newman.
(Eyes glued to the TV) I guess.
I don't see any pie...
Well, it's her mistake. Because she is going to miss the party of a lifetime.
Hellooo Jerry. What a rare treat. What brings you down to the east wing?
Once I find a barber I stick with him. I almost went to barber school. I always felt I had a talent for it.
So we could put the bottles in a U-haul. You know, go lean and mean?
Who made you the leader?
Yeah, tell me about it.
To prevent an ambush.
He's out.
Oh, all the way up.
Yeah. Maybe.
It's getting cold, it's getting cold.
Jerry!
Nevertheless, sometime this afternoon, behind the Market Diner, an unmarked van will be waiting. I'm expecting the call at any time. Are you in?
Federal employee. Federal employee.
Well, you know how much those records are worth!?
Sometimes...
No, but there's karma, Kramer.
Pair of bear claws, please.
(whimpering) Tell the world my story.
All right, all right. Go ahead, go ahead.
No sir. He did not. But only by thge grace of God. He's in the courtroom today
Kramer! Stay left. Left, left, left.
Hey Kramer, those have wholesale value! We could cut our losses.
I just heard that a postman spotted a rickshaw down in Battery Park.
Well, I suppose if you got ten car lengths.
How much gas we got?
Yes I am, a guy on my mail route just got a couple of tickets and he offered one to me.
...it takes just as much man-power to deliver it as their precious little greeting cards...
We din, we didn't ... ... Cosmo?
(Strangling Kramer) What's the matter with you? We had it all worked out!
It's the truck, Kramer. The truck!
Jerry, George. [To Kramer] So, did you ask him about the records?
There's another way it can go down, and it's going down right now!
Hi Babs
Jerry?
Yes, a phone call!
Those records are worth more than five dollars!
Sometimes we don't get what we want.
That was the Vice President of the post office. I didn't get the transfer.. They knew it wasn't me doing my route!
Well, you've both presented very convincing arguments. On the one hand, Elaine, your promise was given in haste. But was it not still a promise? Hmm?
Aww..
(Gesturing to dishes and silverware on the table) But you can clear some of this stuff out of the way.
Hey! What are you doing? It's after six o'clock! You can't give me a ticket! Hey, you're not gonna get away with this. I'll fight this. I got witnesses.
Like Silkwood.
(simultaneous) No problem. You bet.
On my mothers life.
Sorry. But love is spice with many tastes. A dizzying array of textures...and moments.
All right, I'm going to need a clean 8 ounce glass.
(running out the door) Jerry! Jerry!
Is it?! Ohhh, well if only you'd known, you could have saved some time and given it directly to me! Ha ha ha.
Okay, you're all set? You got your story?
(Writing on a clipboard) Rusty.
Oh, how I've waited for this moment. But alas, my heart belongs to another man's wife, and I have given the coat to her.
We have some questions we'd like you to answer.
With your looks and my words, we'll have built the perfect beast. (Kramer claps him on the shoulder, then goes to the other side of the aisle to talk to Pam.)
Drop bye anytime, jerry. Hah, ha ha
No, no I don't like it.
(seeing postal security officials walking towards Kramer) Quick! Get in!
Never.
You're off your rocker.
I dont care much for the beach. I freckle. . . . Is that a,..
Yeah, I suppose.
All my work, my planning, my genius. All for nought.
Okay, here it is.
(Talking to another man) ...yeah he worked in the cubicle right next to me. We once double dated.
(dancing) Can I use your bathroom?
You know I hear Mr. Steinbrenner can be a bit erratic. I would hate to see him when he's hungry.
It was a cinch. Where are you going?
What's the catch?
Oh, Mother's Day. (inspiration strikes) Wait a second. Mother's Day?!
Well, I'm not paying the five cents for that stupid recycling thing.
(triumphant) Yessss!
Yes...
Make us!
Hello jerry. What a pleasant surprise.
What do you think? Drive. Drive.
Ohh, were you there?
(squeezing himself through the narrow space) Nothing, just being neighborly. Do you wanna hang out? Shoot the breeze?
It's Thursday.
Kramer.
We made quite a haul.
All right! All right. I wont say anything.
I told you he was a risk.
Hey, we got ten thousand deposit bottles here. I mean, this guy could be going to Arkansas.
You are nothing but a piece of crap.
No, no. I love strong cider. (for the farmer's daughter's benefit) I'm a big, strong, cider guy.
(reluctant) You know, I don't really know that much about uh.. I don't have any.. I don't.. I don't think I know much about that.
Just to tell me to keep off the snacks!
I don't know. The man makes a pretty strong bird.
(sobbing) Yes, it's been awful. I wanted to tell somebody. (pleading) Help me Kramer! Help me!
Pantene!
And yet, it's perfectly legal to take a man's soul and crush it out like a stale Pall Mall.
Hey, what's up?
Are you crazy?
Now, you're that firend. Now, all we need is a reason why you were going to commit suicide.
All right, give me the rope.
(Pondering Kramer's plan out loud) They do have an intimate knowledge of the street..
So I sped home to save my friend's life and I was stopped for speeding. Yes, I admit I was speeding but it was to save a man's life. A close friend. An innocent person who wanted nothing more out of life than to love, to be loved and to be a banker.
Well, let me remind you of something. You wouldn't be here if it wasn't for me and my helmet. I saved your life! You would be dead! Dead! You would cease to exist! You would be gone for the rest of eternity! You wouldn't even begin to comprehend what that means!!
Sorry. Climbers, keepers.
I don't wanna.
I have a carpet sweeper you can use.
Hello Jerry.
If we put our three heads together we should come up with something.
No! And no one will ever see you again!
All right, all right.
Olly, olly, oxen, free!
(at the counter) Pair of bear claws please.
Hey, another round of strawberry for me and my friends.
An alliance?
...Aargh!
It was McDowell.
Who?
What for, you got your own.
(Negotiating) Your next, fifty wishes.
Oh, thank you, sir.
There will be a small fine.
Well why do we have to keep this from Jerry?
Go on.
You're telling how your parents pushed you into banking.
June 14th, 1987. Mets Phillies. You made a big error. Cost the Mets the game. Then you're coming up the parking lot ramp.
If you ask me, they have no business living amongst us. Vile, USELESS BEASTS . . .
You must!
Hey, hey...
Who is it.
Well sure it would.
All right, tell it.
Nevertheless, ...
Yeah. I just hope Tim Whatley's electric bills don't suddenly get lost in the mail, or it could be lights out for him.
Hmm, that job sounds like it might be worth a year's free haircuts. And a comb.
(salivating) Turkey?
Alright. Come back to my party, please.
I could give you my uniform from my rookie year.
Are you sure you know where the impound yard is?
(to Kramer) You shut up! (to judge) I demand a recess so I can take him outside and help him regain hius composure.
Ohhh!
It's about...Elaine.
Your nipple's showing.
Well, it would take a hell of a lot. Because a friend is something you earn.
Wait a minute. You mean you get five cents here, and ten cents there. You could round up bottles here and run 'em out to Michigan for the difference.
(moving away from the counter getting closer to the door) Hello Jerry.
(Yelling out to Rusty) Alright, pace yourself, 'Cause you're gonna have to do this all day for very little money.
I'm on the roof!
Kind of. I'm still collecting checks, I'm just not delivering mail.
Do I smell Pantene?
Ahaha!
HELP! (Elaine enters.)
It'll be my pleasure.
When the cop stopped me, I told him that I was rushing home because my friend was about to commit suicide.
Hello Jerry, may I come in?
All right. I'm going in. Keep the motor running.
A banker! A banker! Your Honor, Your Honor, Your Honor...
Lately, though, I've been, uh, - I've been buying the generic brand of waxed beans. You know, I rip of the label I can hardly tell the difference.
Well, don't tarry. I'm behind schedule as it is.
Well he really seemed to have his hands full if you know what I mean.
I couldn't. I couldn't tell anyone.
You were going to...
What for?
(Realizing) Damn!
And why was that?
Mind your pace, Boy. Chop, chop!
The guy who had the Hawaii transfer got busted for hoarding Victoria Secret catalogues. I gotta deliver that mail!
Hey! You're not dumping those bottles back there, are you?
Use me for what?
Gladly. (starts munching on the broccoli, then spits it out)
[In Kramer's ear] The old coot's sittin' on a mountain of gold!
Every night I sleep in a really hot room, I don't want to kill myself.
Kramer bit me!
Hello Jerry.
Mmm. You present an interesting dilemma. Each of you seemingly has a legitimate claim to the bicycle, and yet the bicycle can have only one rightful owner. Quite the conundrum. As a federal employee, I believe the law is all we have. (getting worked up) It's all that separates us from the savages who don't deserve even the privilege of the daily mail. (angry) Stuffing parcels into mailboxes where they don't belong!!...
Don't you have a-a boyfriend? A, uh, burly, athletic type?
Hello, Jerry. How's Pam?
Okay.
No. No.
I *loathe* you.
I don't understand. You fill an eighteen-wheeler?
[panting] Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!
It was a real melee.
Damn you Seinfeld. You useless pustule. Um, somebody's got something on the griddle. maybe it's Kramer.
Well, I wouldn't hear of it. I said, "Nice try, granny!" And I sent her to the back of the line!
Not so fast pretty boy. There is more to this sorted little affair.
Hello Jerry. Well, I may have a solution to our little problem. Elaine, would you excuse us?
You've come at a bad time now. Could you come back later?
Yeah well, the budget changed, you know. I mean, it might be a good investment.
If I'm curt, then I appologize. But as I understand it, we have a situation here and time is of the essence.
So what? Do you know whose mailbag that is?
Yeah, I couldn't be sorrier. I uh.
Well that's the way it happened.
Well, I hear it's quite beautiful there this time of year, and of course you know I'm one-quarter French.
Help! Help!
(laughing) Oh ho right. Well very nice seeing you folks and a by the way you didn't hear this from me. Tata (runs down the hallway laughing)
Uh..
(smug) As a matter of fact, I did.
There it is!
Gentlemen, gentlemen. I am so happy to see you both. There is just some inconsistencies I'd like to straighten out.
Ill bring him up to date.
Hello, Jerry. Tim couldn't make it, he's in love. Isn't that wonderful?
I went through all those bottles and all those cans, for what? What a waste. And I'm really gonna catch hell for those missing mailbags.
( resumes eating) Well that's a shame.
Great streak of luck I'm having. First, Kramer almost beat me at Risk but I narrowly escaped, and then Tim Whatley gives me his Super Bowl ticket.
Hey, hey, hey. (to Jerry) I hear you've got some lip reader working for you. You gotta let me use her for one day. Just one day.
It's okay. A little crooked.
I'll meet you at the coffee shop.
Excuse me Miss Weaver, OH! My god it is you! I.. I've seen your show six times..
There's no need to get excited. Can't we discuss this like gentlemen?
What the hell was that?
Me either.
Hello, Jerry. Say, this yogurt is really something, huh? And it's non-fat! I've been waiting for something like this my whole life! And it's finally here!
(Kissing the woman) Beauty .. and brains. (they nuzzle noses)
I hope you realise what you've done. You've destroyed our whole venture.
Why, because I use dental tape?
You know, old friend, sometimes I ponder this silly gulf between us and I say, "Why?" Are we really so different. For what is--
Easy, Jerry. Steady. You wouldn't want to lose your cool at a time like this.
Why I didn't see you at Schindler's List with Jerry.
Anyway.
One large jambalaya, please.
Right.
What, do I have to spell it out for ya? He was moving on her like the storm-troopers into Poland.
I have a private matter to discuss with my fellow tenants. (Opens door) If you don't mind?
Me too.
And, Kramer, you did provide a service in exchange for compensation. But, does the fee, once paid, not entitle the buyer to some assurance Of reliability? Hmm? Huh? Ahh. These were not easy questions to answer. Not for any man...
(taking bottle) Refund?
They follow him like a cult.
And a slice of pepperoni pizza and a large soda and three times a week I will require a canolie.
Huh.
I'm sorry I missed that.
I don't like it.
Yes, yes. May I go? Cause I gotta go very badly.
Take it or leave it!? We got *Al Jolson* here, *Al Jolson*!!
You certainly are in a bind.
Yeah, but you pulled him in.
Alright, well be back... *jack*!
eue-aaa.
And then you spit on us.
Alright, who's first?
See'ya later.
Ten cents!?
Ahh! This is very much as I imagined it to be. Aside from this rattan piece, which seems oddly out of place.
But, on the week before holidays, we see a surge. On alentine's Day, we send two trucks. On Christmas, four, packed to the brim. And tomorrow, if history is any guide, will see some spillover into a fifth truck.
Alright.
Well for starters I want a calzone of my own.....
Yeah, yeah.
Hey, you want me to mail it? I'm on my way out anyway.
Not so fast, Elaine! Only the bike's true owner would rather give it away than see it come to harm. Kramer, the bike is yours!
The courthouse. You gotta go with me to the courthouse. I'm contesting a ticket today.
It was your family that pushed you into banking , it was their dream for you...
I know you know, but you don't know what I know.
Take me! Take me!
I find you extremely ugly.
Oh, can I watch a little? Cuz it's my favorite movie.
Cool?
(Sinister) All right, all right. All right you go ahead. You go ahead and keep it secret. But you remember this. When you control the mail, you control... information.
(after speeding truck) Kramer!!
Come on, let me try it on.
What keeps the water in there? I mean, why doesn't it disappear?
Ah, she just didn't do it for me.
Hey, don't listen to him. I mean, we can't afford a detour. Our budget won't hold it.
I like the thick tape.
...But, you must promise That you will abide by my decision, no matter how unjust it may seem to either of you. Do I have your word?
It's pretty hot under these lights huh Seinfeld. Pretty....... Hot .
You gotta go with me. I mean, you-you're my alibi. You have to take the stand.
No, you can't tell it ..
I can't sleep, I tell you! I can't sleep!
"Pam." I don't know the woman, but she sounds quite fetching.
You emit a foul and unpleasant odour.
Boy, thats the full size.
Damn!
Exactly. You're a disgrace to the uniform. (Newman takes off Jerry's mailman hat. Jerry turns his head in shame. Newman then tears the post office badge from Jerry's coat)
What're you doing?
(surprised) Kramer.
Yes, from me!! I called you remember?
(interrogating Kramer) Mister Kramer, you heard the testimony so far. Would you please tell the court in your own words what happened on the afternoon of September 10th?
Yep.
All right, all right. I'll help you but I will except something in return.
Are you married right now? (points at Jerry)
No, no, no, no no. Listen to me. Most days, the post office sends one truckload of mail to the second domestic regional sorting facility in Sagenaw, Michigan.
Tuesday has no feel. Monday has a feel, Friday has a feel, Sunday has a feel....
Yeah, sure.
The mother of all mail days. And guess who signed up for the truck.
Well you're reneging.
Yes, the banker!!!
I hope you know what you're doing... (Kramer gives Newman a look of lack of confidence)
You go.
You dated her. Give me some inside information. Anything I can use!
No, no, no. That's not gonna work. Something else.
Crazy Joe Davola?
Quite frankly, I don't see how it's any of your business.
Fleas? Bwa ha ha ha ha .That's preposterous. How can I , give you fleas. Now if you don't mind...
The Pacific Northwest.
(peering at bottle label) What is this 'MI, ten cents'?
Ah, yes. Forbidden love.
Lucky krauts.
ha ha ha Well you know sometimes it just has a way of finding you. Cigarette?
(Thinks for a moment) I guess you're right. It's just walking around putting it into boxes..
I HAD a girlfriend and she was pretty wild.
Can I have a sip?
Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry.
I WANT MY HELMET BACK! GIVE ME BACK MY HELMET AND YOU'RE GOING TO PAY FOR THAT TICKET.
No. I need a really pretty face. But, Hey, that's me.
Oooh,
Yes thank you. (slams door)
(triumph) Let the collecting begin!
It was disgusting.
It's the romance of the Handsome Cab without the guilt or dander of the equine.
Kramer!
(Cannot take this torture anymore) Baaaaaaaaarrhhhhhhhhhhh....I'm ripped with fleas ( scratches furiously)
I can't believe I'm being evicted.
Kramer?! Kramer!? Where are you? Kramer!?! Kramer!!?
(perks up) A pie stand? Where?
I love.. broccoli, its, good for you.
I'm not beaten yet. I still have armies in the Ukraine.
Oh the theater. Because I was wondering.
Is that Jerry's number?
Yes! A more offensive spectacle I cannot recall. Anyway I just really came up to get some detergent.
I can't think, there's all this noise.
Can't we worry about them later?
I hope he stays this happy when he wakes up.
Look, you said the one in the second courtyard. He was in the second courtyard.
So, to what do I owe this unusual invitation?
Five dollars. He offered us *five* dollars.
I believe the deal was that I get the calzones on my mail route. Well today I won't be going on my mail route! Will I. Perhaps tomorrow.
You must be banker.
Thank you. [inhaling deeply] Jambalaya!
Butter?
Oh, don't you? Joke boy? You really think you can manipulate that beautiful young woman like the half-soused nightclub rabble that lap up your inane "observations"?
And therein lies the tragedy. For I believe, sadly for you, that there is but one woman meant for each of us. One perfect angel for whom we are put on this earth.
To the Newmanniun! (holds out his hand)
Yes, I called you, you idiot! Because you were going to... You were going to... Remember?
Cancel! (jumps to feet) Think again, longshanks! I started planning this in nineteen seventy-eight. I put a deposit down on that revolving restaurant that overlooks Times Square, and I booked Christopher Cross.
He's giving away what's left! I gotta go home and get a big pot!
Hello Mrs. Seinfeld
Stop it, George, stop it. I was defending your parking.
Mouth-to-mouth?
Oh no, no, not the bag!
Well, ta-ta! (Scampers away.)
(to Kramer) You wanna know why you can't go in front first? I'll tell you why. because it signals a breakdown in the social order. Chaos. It reduces us to jungle law.
It looks like your breaking into it like an otter breaking into a clad.
Jerry, you better stop her or Ill tell.
All right. Then let me ask you this. Didn't you find it interesting that your friend had the foresight to purchase postal insurance for your stereo. Huh. I mean parcels are rarely damaged during shipping.
Not really.
(breaking from his pose) Can I have some gravy?
You?! (Laughs hysterically) You can't deliver mail!
How much longer you gonna be, I'm starving here.
Oh well. Let me perfectly blunt. I don't care for you Costanza. You hang out at the west side of the building with Seinfeld all day and just it up wasting your lives.
Not that!
Can I try it on?
Hello Jerry.
George?
(mouth full) It's delicious mutton. This is uh, this is outta sight. I would, I would love to get the recipe. It's very good.
Hello?
(excited) Ooh, my cocoa!
Shell.
Because I don't, never have, anything I read was already open.
Wallet.
(pushing past Kramer) Kramer, help me! Help me!
June 14, 1987.... Mets Phillies. We're enjoying a beautiful afternoon in the right field stands when a crucial Hernandez error to a five run Phillies ninth. Cost the Mets the game.
(Together) Sucker..
He's shipping us a rickshaw. It can't miss!
Ah, don't worry about a thing. In twenty minutes that place'll be swarming with mailmen. We'll be back on the street by lunch.
Well, ELAINE, There's any number of things I could do. But, I can promise you this, though, this vicious beast will never bother you again. So, what's it going to be?
(Suggesting Jerry) Does yours?
This isn't about my opening your mail?
Right. Kramer, you have to confront Jerry.
I knew you'd back out.
Yes, Yes, now please. Someone, honey mustard.
???????
What d'you mean it doesn't work? You get enough bottles together...
From me!
... a man can really get some thinking done. (sits on couch, next to Kramer.)
Aahh! You're great,It's great, It's so great to see a show that's (looks at Jerry) about something.
We gotta find that rickshaw. You check the sewers and dumpsters. I'll hit the soup kitchens, bakeries, and smorgasbords.
Ahhh! Yaaaahhh!
Don't despair, my friend. (Newman walks in front of Kramer and trips over his feet. Again.) I won't allow your love to go unrequited. Not like mine.
I didn't get my transfer.
(enters) KEITH HERNANDEZ?
Fourty-nine.
(Urgent) I need that mail, where is it?!
You wanna know what happened to Kramer? I'll tell you what happened to Kramer. He was ticked off. About the keys. Yeah, that's right - about the keys. Thought he got a bad rap.
Do you really want to know what happened? I'll tell you what Happened. She wasn't my type.
...But I have made a decision. (revelatory) We will cut the bike down the middle, and give half to each of you.
You lookin' for someone?
Are you going to give me back that helmet or not?
I called in sick. I don't work in the rain.
Woah.
Wow, where did you get that?
We had an arguement about me going to Hawaii, and he locked onto my ankle like it was a soup bone. I'm hubbled! I don't think I can do my route - and they're awarding the transfer in two days!
Okay, we'll go with the banker story.
I know exactly how he feels. Pleasure doing business with you. Do come again. Ha, ha, ha, ha.
You know what I mean.
What are you doing?
Oh no. Don't tell me. You're gambling again, aren't you? Oh you weak, weak man. Where are you?
I don't have that kinda dough.
You can't taste 'em . Why waste 'em . Why not give them all to me.
You know, those mail bags, they get mighty heavy. I uh, I Nautilus, of course. (puffs out his chest)
(to Kramer) That's where my missing soda is.
Hello, boys.
Kramer!!
Hello, Jerry. Will he take it? I gotta go to work.
Yeah.
I don't know, they're deranged.
(thoughtful) What kind?
Nah.
That smell. It's still with you, huh?
Tim Whatley.
Yes. It's called mail fraud. Oohhhh. How I've longed for this moment Seinfeld. The day when I would have the proof I needed to hall you out of your cushy lair and expose to the light of justice as the monster that you are. A monster so vile.....
I usually do. (Gets up to leave) See ya.
Hello Jerry. (to Kramer) So, any news?
I was speaking earlier with Kramer and he mentioned something about a private jet to Paris?
To Hawaii. The most sought-after postal route of them all. The air is so dewy-sweet you don't even have to like the stamps.. But it's not to be - So, I'm hanging it up.
Blast!
Your Honor, I'm only trying to establish Mister Kramer's fragile emotional state, my entire case depends on it.
Kramer.
Clean? Hardly. This looks like a man that isn't happy with his stereo performance.
You might say that.
What are you doing?
We got no one!
Name, please.
We had a deal. Are you reneging out of the deal? Are you reneging? That's a renege.
I'm doing it for you.
Blast! There's no way I can handle 8 in addition to my ususal load of one! I'll never get to Hawaii! (Moves over to Jerry's couch, depressed) I'll be stuck in this apartment building forever! (Lays down on Jerry's couch) The dream is dead.
Jerry wouldn't know delicate beauty if it bludgeoned him over the head.
No reason.
(excited) We carry a coupla bags of mail, and the rest is ours!
Aaah! Aaagh! Aah-aah. Oh, oh the humanity! Aaagh!
(leaving) Oh, by the way, what are you doing for the Super Bowl?
Minding my own business.
I use dental tape.
Reversed?! (Kramer comes hobbling out of the doctors office in pain, after having a vasectomy of his own, and exits. Jerry and Newman look at each other, and bolt for the door themselves.)
Is this or is this not your signature?
That's right.
(sings) You're once. Twice. Three times a lady.
All right, it's true! Of course nobody needs mail. What do you think, you're so clever for figuring that out? But you don't know the half of what goes on here. So just walk away, Kramer. I beg of you.
Yes. No, wait! OK, yes.
I wanna learn. I want to know why.
I was never that big on creeds.
So , you have fleas. Maybe you keep your house in a state of disrepair. Maybe you live in squalor.
The reverse peepholes. Silvio said I'm an agitator and I'm out of the building.
Jerry? I'm a little insulted.
(Scared) Boy.. Boy. Kramer!
The bank. What about your cards and letters?
Yea, it's the wood that makes it good.
Sorry , last one . Would you want to suck the pit?
Him and his little buxom friend Rachel were going at it pretty good in the balcony.
It's entirely possible.
Wow, it was McDowell.
(looking scared) I-it's a it's a...powerful film.
A second later, something happened that changed us in a deep and profound way front that day forward.
(screaming in panic) Aaah!! Aaah!
Yeah, but I though-
I did invite you. Your invitation must've gotten ... lost in the mail.
You're gyppin' us!
Oh yes, in fact I still have family there. This probably won't interest you, but I have a cousin there who's suffering very badly. She's lost all use of her muscles. She can only communicate by blinking. I would so love to see her - bring a ray of sunshine into her tragic life. But alas, I can't afford it, for I am, as you know, but a simple postal worker.
(Realizing he won) Yeah.
It's Newman.
Hello Jerry. (to Kramer) What did you say to Elaine? I just got her cancellation in the mail.
(fleeing to the bedroom) Damn!
Look, sister, go get yourself a cup of coffee, all right? Beat it! (Pushes Elaine out the door and closes it) All right, now here's the lowdown. From a certain connection, I've been able to locate some black market shower heads. They're all made in the former Yugoslavia, and from what I hear the Serbs are fanatic about their showers.
(Intrigued) What are you proposing?
Well my girlfriend had one.
Waaaaahhhh!
That he may be. But he's outta my life, starting in the year two-thousand. For me, the next millennium must be, Jerry-free!
What about a guest-host?
Work? It's raining.
Don't say anything.
(defensive) What're you talking about...
Yeah, me too.
But Jerry, we've got this new supervisor down at the post office. He's working behind this glass. I know they're talking about me. They're going to transfer me, I know it. Two hours, give me two hours.
We'll pay anything. We've got the (hands a wad of money to Kramer) What about Jerry?
All right! But hear me and hear me well - The day will come. Oh yes, mark my words, Seinfeld - your day of reckoning is coming. When an evil wind will blow through your little playworld, and wipe that smug smile off your face. And I'll be there, in all my glory, watching - watching as it all comes crumbling down.
(Stands up and Sputtering loudly) Kramer! I'm with people.
I'll handle this, Violet. Why don't you take your three hour break? Oh, calm down, everyone. No one's cancelling any mail.
We're practically to Monticello.
A radar detector, as I understand it, DETECTS RADAR! WITH A SERIES OF BEEPS AND FLASHING LIGHTS. But oddly, for some reason I didn't hear a thing except for the sound of a police siren.
All right. See you later.
Well, there is a little something you can do for me...
Hilarious.
Butter. Kramer. Butter. Kramer.
Aaaaahhh...!!!
Coy? I'm not being coy.
The airport?
Well, tootle loo. And nice seeing you again Margaret, goodbye Jerry. Have fun. Hehe
Excellent. Excellent.
He did it right in this bed, Martin. Right in front of you.
I guess there's not much action down there these days.
Where? I..I..I don't see it.
Anything else?
I'm leavin'. Jerry's a nut. (Exits)
So, which one of us is gonna pull?
Oh, yeah, right.
Uh-Huh.
No.
Yeah. From you.
Let's go. Let's go. Move!
It's gorgeous water. (pause) Do we own Bermuda?
One winsome tulip we ceaselessly yearn for throughout our dreary, workaday lives! And you, my friend, have found your angel. I can tell. For my heart has also been captured by a breathless beauty - whom I fear I will never possess.
It gets my rug clean.
Kramer, what the hell are you doing?
Well, h ha ha- if you're happy with her, that's all that matters.
Of course. Take your time. I be here.
Deh!
Come on, are you ready? Let's go!
I know how you feel. For I, too, have a woman for whom I pine.
(sings) Yes, you're once. Twice. Three times...
I shoulda gone in with him.
Yeah, but he's a fighter.
Here.
What makes you think I'm lookin' for trouble?
Frequently.
It was because you hated your father and you would do anything to displease him. Isn't THAT true?
(To his new girlfriend) You see, my dear, all certified mail is registered, but registered mail is not necessarily certified.
Come on lets go. I got the helmet. Lets get the radar detector.
Uh, you, uh, you better put something on.
You heard me. So he packed it up and split for the coast. La-La Land. L.A.
Here. Hold this.
Bark.
You see, it'd been his lifelong dream to be a banker and he uh, just the day before he was turned down by another bank. I believe it was the Manufacturer's Hanover on Lexington and 40th Street. That was the third bank to turn him down so I was-I was a little concerned. I wanted to see how he was doing. Well, Your Honor, he was barely audible. But I distinctly recall him say...
(smugly) That is seven dollars and twenty-two cents better.
Hey Jerry. Look at all the towels they gave me! I really hit the jackpot! (holding a large stack of towels, Newman pats his face with the top one) Ha, ha, ha.
Look, I don't have time to explain every little thing to you.
We're making a trade. I'm giving him my motorcycle helmet - he's giving me his radar detector.
Don't look at me.
Who's talking to you?
Can I have a bite?
(a touch desperate) Ah, look, I..I'm sorry to bother you, but I'm a US postal worker and my mail truck was just ambushed by a band of backwoods mail-hating survivalists.
That's good stuff, and you can never have too much ice. Alright, I'll tell you what I'll do. You can co-host the party with me, under one condition. No Jerry. Jerry is not invited.
Hi. How are you?
No.
Alright, go ahead and hit me, Seinfeld. I got witnesses.
Can't do it. I'm on an unbelievable birthday-wish hot streak! My last five birthday wishes came true.
For I am in love with Svetlana, and I don't care if the whole world knows, except for Silvio, who would throw me out of the apartment, where I would be dancing on the sidewalk--
Then I turned and the spit ricochet of him and it hit me.
I despise him.
Okay. What is it?
Alright then, I guess I can accept a little Jerry, if it gets me a (suggestive) lot of Elaine.
Come on Kramer!
Yeah, just the way that I was raised. I'm special.
(From outside the room) Kramer? Kramer? (Enters Jerry's bedroom) There you are.
On what?
I wanted to, he won't let me.
(To Jerry) Good night.
Hee hee! Yeah yeah!
I don't care. It was good. I was enjoying it. Had to interfere. Couldn't leave well enough alone. Well, I will get even with you for this. You can count on it.
I cant eat fruit. It makes me incontinent.
Well, it's-it's interesting work, I don't mind it.
Son of Sam. The worst mass murderer the post office ever produced.
I'm a United States postal worker.
I took over his route. And boy, were there a lot of dogs on that route.
(thinking to himself; checks a comb) No. (checks a brush) Jackpot. I don't believe this. There's no hair in this thing. I've never seen a person that didn't have at least one hair in a brush.
Uh ah (stops her from closing the door; walks in) Having a nice trip? (walks over, grabs a junior mint, smells it then puts it in his pocket)
Hello, Jerry.
Care for some lemonade?
Well if you watch closely enough, you just might see me. I'll be the one waving to the camera from my seat on the forty yard line.
Thanks buddy. So long he he ...(exits)
