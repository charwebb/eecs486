Just to tell me to keep off the snacks!
(from the corner of the Yogurt shop) Hey, Jerry. Thanks a lot. I hope you're happy.
Well, ELAINE, There's any number of things I could do. But, I can promise you this, though, this vicious beast will never bother you again. So, what's it going to be?
I don't know. The man makes a pretty strong bird.
ha ha ha Well you know sometimes it just has a way of finding you. Cigarette?
But, on the week before holidays, we see a surge. On alentine's Day, we send two trucks. On Christmas, four, packed to the brim. And tomorrow, if history is any guide, will see some spillover into a fifth truck.
That he may be. But he's outta my life, starting in the year two-thousand. For me, the next millennium must be, Jerry-free!
Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry.
And one more thing. I'm not coming to your party. (exits)
There's another way it can go down, and it's going down right now!
You are nothing but a piece of crap.
Don't you have a-a boyfriend? A, uh, burly, athletic type?
You know, old friend, sometimes I ponder this silly gulf between us and I say, "Why?" Are we really so different. For what is--
(pushing past Kramer) Kramer, help me! Help me!
(reluctant) You don't wanna do your... act, or anything, do you?
Yes, yes. May I go? Cause I gotta go very badly.
I'm homeless! I'm gonna be out on a street corner, dancing for nickels. I'll be with the hobos in the trainyard, eating out of a bucket.
So I sped home to save my friend's life and I was stopped for speeding. Yes, I admit I was speeding but it was to save a man's life. A close friend. An innocent person who wanted nothing more out of life than to love, to be loved and to be a banker.
Look, sister, go get yourself a cup of coffee, all right? Beat it! (Pushes Elaine out the door and closes it) All right, now here's the lowdown. From a certain connection, I've been able to locate some black market shower heads. They're all made in the former Yugoslavia, and from what I hear the Serbs are fanatic about their showers.
Hey! What are you doing? It's after six o'clock! You can't give me a ticket! Hey, you're not gonna get away with this. I'll fight this. I got witnesses.
And, Kramer, you did provide a service in exchange for compensation. But, does the fee, once paid, not entitle the buyer to some assurance Of reliability? Hmm? Huh? Ahh. These were not easy questions to answer. Not for any man...
Yes! A more offensive spectacle I cannot recall. Anyway I just really came up to get some detergent.
Hello, Jerry. Tim couldn't make it, he's in love. Isn't that wonderful?
Mmm. You present an interesting dilemma. Each of you seemingly has a legitimate claim to the bicycle, and yet the bicycle can have only one rightful owner. Quite the conundrum. As a federal employee, I believe the law is all we have. (getting worked up) It's all that separates us from the savages who don't deserve even the privilege of the daily mail. (angry) Stuffing parcels into mailboxes where they don't belong!!...
Gotta go. Oh gee, I dropped a nickel (reaches down and picks up the hair.)
Gentlemen, gentlemen. I am so happy to see you both. There is just some inconsistencies I'd like to straighten out.
I'm not beaten yet. I still have armies in the Ukraine.
Kind of. I'm still collecting checks, I'm just not delivering mail.
...But I have made a decision. (revelatory) We will cut the bike down the middle, and give half to each of you.
Hey, we got ten thousand deposit bottles here. I mean, this guy could be going to Arkansas.
I hope you realise what you've done. You've destroyed our whole venture.
Because the mail never stops. It just keeps coming and coming and coming, there's never a let-up. It's relentless. Every day it piles up more and more and more! And you gotta get it out but the more you get it out the more it keeps coming in. And then the bar code reader breaks and it's *Publisher's Clearing House* day!!!
Fleas? Bwa ha ha ha ha .That's preposterous. How can I , give you fleas. Now if you don't mind...
Do you really want to know what happened? I'll tell you what Happened. She wasn't my type.
All right, all right. Go ahead, go ahead.
All right. Then let me ask you this. Didn't you find it interesting that your friend had the foresight to purchase postal insurance for your stereo. Huh. I mean parcels are rarely damaged during shipping.
Well why do we have to keep this from Jerry?
(at the counter) Pair of bear claws please.
That guy thought we were a couple of total squares.
Stop it, George, stop it. I was defending your parking.
Well, it's her mistake. Because she is going to miss the party of a lifetime.
Well, it's-it's interesting work, I don't mind it.
I believe the deal was that I get the calzones on my mail route. Well today I won't be going on my mail route! Will I. Perhaps tomorrow.
Okay, you're all set? You got your story?
(interrogating Kramer) Mister Kramer, you heard the testimony so far. Would you please tell the court in your own words what happened on the afternoon of September 10th?
All right. I'm going in. Keep the motor running.
Hey, don't listen to him. I mean, we can't afford a detour. Our budget won't hold it.
Of course. Take your time. I be here.
Well, you'll never guess what happened to me today. I was uh, driving ( Jerry and Kramer turn away) home on the palisades parkway when I looked in the rear view mirror and what did I see? The fuzz. And it's funny because my new radar detector was on. I didn't hear a thing. Isn't that strange?
You heard me. So he packed it up and split for the coast. La-La Land. L.A.
Every night I sleep in a really hot room, I don't want to kill myself.
If you ask me, they have no business living amongst us. Vile, USELESS BEASTS . . .
(smugly) That is seven dollars and twenty-two cents better.
I usually do. (Gets up to leave) See ya.
(leaving) Oh, by the way, what are you doing for the Super Bowl?
Those records are worth more than five dollars!
So what? Do you know whose mailbag that is?
Sorry. But love is spice with many tastes. A dizzying array of textures...and moments.
All right! But hear me and hear me well - The day will come. Oh yes, mark my words, Seinfeld - your day of reckoning is coming. When an evil wind will blow through your little playworld, and wipe that smug smile off your face. And I'll be there, in all my glory, watching - watching as it all comes crumbling down.
Twenty bucks?!? Are you out of your mind?
Ah, don't worry about a thing. In twenty minutes that place'll be swarming with mailmen. We'll be back on the street by lunch.
Not so fast pretty boy. There is more to this sorted little affair.
Oh, can I watch a little? Cuz it's my favorite movie.
(squeezing himself through the narrow space) Nothing, just being neighborly. Do you wanna hang out? Shoot the breeze?
Well, I suppose if you got ten car lengths.
(Talking to another man) ...yeah he worked in the cubicle right next to me. We once double dated.
What, do I have to spell it out for ya? He was moving on her like the storm-troopers into Poland.
...it takes just as much man-power to deliver it as their precious little greeting cards...
Well, you should take a look at my rug then.
Gladly. (starts munching on the broccoli, then spits it out)
(excited) We carry a coupla bags of mail, and the rest is ours!
Reversed?! (Kramer comes hobbling out of the doctors office in pain, after having a vasectomy of his own, and exits. Jerry and Newman look at each other, and bolt for the door themselves.)
Hey! You're not dumping those bottles back there, are you?
But you never became a banker, did you Mister Kramer? Why? Why did you fail?
"Pam." I don't know the woman, but she sounds quite fetching.
Well, I'm not paying the five cents for that stupid recycling thing.
Great streak of luck I'm having. First, Kramer almost beat me at Risk but I narrowly escaped, and then Tim Whatley gives me his Super Bowl ticket.
It was because you hated your father and you would do anything to displease him. Isn't THAT true?
It was your family that pushed you into banking , it was their dream for you...
I was speaking earlier with Kramer and he mentioned something about a private jet to Paris?
Yes. It's called mail fraud. Oohhhh. How I've longed for this moment Seinfeld. The day when I would have the proof I needed to hall you out of your cushy lair and expose to the light of justice as the monster that you are. A monster so vile.....
I know how you feel. For I, too, have a woman for whom I pine.
You're in trouble, Kramer. I shouldn't even be talking to you, but I'm telling you as a friend. Here's how it's going to happen you may be walking. Maybe on a crisp, autumn day just like today. When a mail truck will slow beside you, and a door will open, and a mailman you know, maybe even trust, will offer to give you a lift.
...But, you must promise That you will abide by my decision, no matter how unjust it may seem to either of you. Do I have your word?
Oh yes, in fact I still have family there. This probably won't interest you, but I have a cousin there who's suffering very badly. She's lost all use of her muscles. She can only communicate by blinking. I would so love to see her - bring a ray of sunshine into her tragic life. But alas, I can't afford it, for I am, as you know, but a simple postal worker.
Aww, c'mon, pull over, pull over will ya.
I don't care. It was good. I was enjoying it. Had to interfere. Couldn't leave well enough alone. Well, I will get even with you for this. You can count on it.
(Stands up) Too many people go their mail! Close to 80%. No body from the post office has ever cracked the 50% barrier! It's like the 3-minute mile!
... a man can really get some thinking done. (sits on couch, next to Kramer.)
I had gone up to Westchester. I go there every Tuesday. I do charity for the blind in my spare time for the Lighthouse. I was in the middle of a game of Parcheesi with an old blind man and I excused myself to call my friend as he was very depressed lately because he never became a banker.
"Do not bend". (Laughs evilly) Just crease, crumple, cram.. you'll do fine. (Phone rings. Newman answers it) Hello?.. This is he. I don't understand.. very well. (Hangs up in disappointment)
I HAD a girlfriend and she was pretty wild.
Hellooo Jerry. What a rare treat. What brings you down to the east wing?
(thinking to himself; checks a comb) No. (checks a brush) Jackpot. I don't believe this. There's no hair in this thing. I've never seen a person that didn't have at least one hair in a brush.
You wanna know what happened to Kramer? I'll tell you what happened to Kramer. He was ticked off. About the keys. Yeah, that's right - about the keys. Thought he got a bad rap.
All right give it to me. let go ...
(moving away from the counter getting closer to the door) Hello Jerry.
Well, it would take a hell of a lot. Because a friend is something you earn.
You know, those mail bags, they get mighty heavy. I uh, I Nautilus, of course. (puffs out his chest)
All right, I'm going to need a clean 8 ounce glass.
So we could put the bottles in a U-haul. You know, go lean and mean?
Are you going to give me back that helmet or not?
(Strangling Kramer) What's the matter with you? We had it all worked out!
Hey, we can't follow him, we're going north to Michigan.
(to Kramer) You shut up! (to judge) I demand a recess so I can take him outside and help him regain hius composure.
[In Kramer's ear] The old coot's sittin' on a mountain of gold!
What you need me in the car for?
You gave me a defective detector. ... Jerry?
(on the phone in his apartment with a Bald head) Not for a while.
You know, when you think about it, it's kind of silly for us both to pull this thing all t he way back uptown. I mean, after all, it is a conveyance.
(sings) You're once. Twice. Three times a lady.
Look, you said the one in the second courtyard. He was in the second courtyard.
A second later, something happened that changed us in a deep and profound way front that day forward.
With your looks and my words, we'll have built the perfect beast. (Kramer claps him on the shoulder, then goes to the other side of the aisle to talk to Pam.)
Yes I am, a guy on my mail route just got a couple of tickets and he offered one to me.
I have a carpet sweeper you can use.
Hey Kramer, those have wholesale value! We could cut our losses.
Not so fast, Elaine! Only the bike's true owner would rather give it away than see it come to harm. Kramer, the bike is yours!
(peering at bottle label) What is this 'MI, ten cents'?
It was a cinch. Where are you going?
What keeps the water in there? I mean, why doesn't it disappear?
I just heard that a postman spotted a rickshaw down in Battery Park.
Once I find a barber I stick with him. I almost went to barber school. I always felt I had a talent for it.
Nevertheless, sometime this afternoon, behind the Market Diner, an unmarked van will be waiting. I'm expecting the call at any time. Are you in?
(Cannot take this torture anymore) Baaaaaaaaarrhhhhhhhhhhh....I'm ripped with fleas ( scratches furiously)
(breaking from his pose) Can I have some gravy?
(mouth full) It's delicious mutton. This is uh, this is outta sight. I would, I would love to get the recipe. It's very good.
Uncle Leo? This case is closed pending further evidence. Jerry.
Well he really seemed to have his hands full if you know what I mean.
All right! All right. I wont say anything.
Hey, hey, hey. (to Jerry) I hear you've got some lip reader working for you. You gotta let me use her for one day. Just one day.
I cant eat fruit. It makes me incontinent.
And a slice of pepperoni pizza and a large soda and three times a week I will require a canolie.
Oh, don't you? Joke boy? You really think you can manipulate that beautiful young woman like the half-soused nightclub rabble that lap up your inane "observations"?
We'll pay anything. We've got the (hands a wad of money to Kramer) What about Jerry?
The guy who had the Hawaii transfer got busted for hoarding Victoria Secret catalogues. I gotta deliver that mail!
All right, all right. I'll help you but I will except something in return.
You can't taste 'em . Why waste 'em . Why not give them all to me.
Ah, she just didn't do it for me.
June 14th, 1987. Mets Phillies. You made a big error. Cost the Mets the game. Then you're coming up the parking lot ramp.
Sorry , last one . Would you want to suck the pit?
Quite frankly, I don't see how it's any of your business.
If I'm curt, then I appologize. But as I understand it, we have a situation here and time is of the essence.
Wait a minute. You mean you get five cents here, and ten cents there. You could round up bottles here and run 'em out to Michigan for the difference.
Now, you're that firend. Now, all we need is a reason why you were going to commit suicide.
Uh ah (stops her from closing the door; walks in) Having a nice trip? (walks over, grabs a junior mint, smells it then puts it in his pocket)
Uh, you, uh, you better put something on.
I could give you my uniform from my rookie year.
Jerry, you better stop her or Ill tell.
But Jerry, we've got this new supervisor down at the post office. He's working behind this glass. I know they're talking about me. They're going to transfer me, I know it. Two hours, give me two hours.
Look, I don't have time to explain every little thing to you.
Oh, how I've waited for this moment. But alas, my heart belongs to another man's wife, and I have given the coat to her.
All right, it's true! Of course nobody needs mail. What do you think, you're so clever for figuring that out? But you don't know the half of what goes on here. So just walk away, Kramer. I beg of you.
Yeah? Well, you bombed! That story stunk worse than these chairs!
What d'you mean it doesn't work? You get enough bottles together...
Is this or is this not your signature?
Alright then, I guess I can accept a little Jerry, if it gets me a (suggestive) lot of Elaine.
Oh, well it's a good thing for Jerry that you didn't go.
Elaine's down there causing all kinds of commotion. Somehow she got a hold of his recipes and she says she's gonna drive him out of business! The Soup Nazi said that now that his recipes are out, he's not gonna make anymore soup! He's moving out of the country, moving to Argentina! No more soup, Jerry! No more for of us!
So , you have fleas. Maybe you keep your house in a state of disrepair. Maybe you live in squalor.
Son of Sam. The worst mass murderer the post office ever produced.
When the cop stopped me, I told him that I was rushing home because my friend was about to commit suicide.
I wanna learn. I want to know why.
Hey, you want me to mail it? I'm on my way out anyway.
Lately, though, I've been, uh, - I've been buying the generic brand of waxed beans. You know, I rip of the label I can hardly tell the difference.
He's giving away what's left! I gotta go home and get a big pot!
I can't sleep, I tell you! I can't sleep!
Your Honor, I'm only trying to establish Mister Kramer's fragile emotional state, my entire case depends on it.
I hope he stays this happy when he wakes up.
That was the Vice President of the post office. I didn't get the transfer.. They knew it wasn't me doing my route!
Come on lets go. I got the helmet. Lets get the radar detector.
Hello, Jerry. Will he take it? I gotta go to work.
I took over his route. And boy, were there a lot of dogs on that route.
Alright, go ahead and hit me, Seinfeld. I got witnesses.
You dated her. Give me some inside information. Anything I can use!
Take it or leave it!? We got *Al Jolson* here, *Al Jolson*!!
We're making a trade. I'm giving him my motorcycle helmet - he's giving me his radar detector.
The reverse peepholes. Silvio said I'm an agitator and I'm out of the building.
You know Ron's Records down on Bleeker? They pay big cash for used records!
(Yelling out to Rusty) Alright, pace yourself, 'Cause you're gonna have to do this all day for very little money.
Hey Jerry. Look at all the towels they gave me! I really hit the jackpot! (holding a large stack of towels, Newman pats his face with the top one) Ha, ha, ha.
Yeah. I just hope Tim Whatley's electric bills don't suddenly get lost in the mail, or it could be lights out for him.
Jerry, George. [To Kramer] So, did you ask him about the records?
It's gorgeous water. (pause) Do we own Bermuda?
Aahh! You're great,It's great, It's so great to see a show that's (looks at Jerry) about something.
You gotta go with me. I mean, you-you're my alibi. You have to take the stand.
If we put our three heads together we should come up with something.
He did it right in this bed, Martin. Right in front of you.
Then I turned and the spit ricochet of him and it hit me.
There's no need to get excited. Can't we discuss this like gentlemen?
Exactly. You're a disgrace to the uniform. (Newman takes off Jerry's mailman hat. Jerry turns his head in shame. Newman then tears the post office badge from Jerry's coat)
A radar detector, as I understand it, DETECTS RADAR! WITH A SERIES OF BEEPS AND FLASHING LIGHTS. But oddly, for some reason I didn't hear a thing except for the sound of a police siren.
And yet, it's perfectly legal to take a man's soul and crush it out like a stale Pall Mall.
I have a private matter to discuss with my fellow tenants. (Opens door) If you don't mind?
Yes, sir, I believe everything is all squared away. Isn't it, Mr. Kramer?
How much longer you gonna be, I'm starving here.
I know exactly how he feels. Pleasure doing business with you. Do come again. Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Not going to play ball. Huh all right. Admit it that stereo was all ready busted.
(to Kramer) That's where my missing soda is.
(To Rusty) Alright, uh, take it down to the end of the block. Make a controlled turn, and bring her back. Let's see what you've got! Ok? Ready, and go!
Hey, hey maybe I should go with him?
Ahh! This is very much as I imagined it to be. Aside from this rattan piece, which seems oddly out of place.
Well, h ha ha- if you're happy with her, that's all that matters.
(With a gorgeous woman sitting on his lap) Did I?
Pilot? So what do you make for something like that? Fifty? Sixty thousand?
Well, don't tarry. I'm behind schedule as it is.
(laughing) Oh ho right. Well very nice seeing you folks and a by the way you didn't hear this from me. Tata (runs down the hallway laughing)
You just got it? Damn, the mail is slow.
Why I didn't see you at Schindler's List with Jerry.
What's the matter with you? I just talked to you fifteen minutes ago.
I WANT MY HELMET BACK! GIVE ME BACK MY HELMET AND YOU'RE GOING TO PAY FOR THAT TICKET.
I hope you know what you're doing... (Kramer gives Newman a look of lack of confidence)
South America?! (to Jerry) What kind of snow blower you get us mixed up with?
No! And no one will ever see you again!
Blast! There's no way I can handle 8 in addition to my ususal load of one! I'll never get to Hawaii! (Moves over to Jerry's couch, depressed) I'll be stuck in this apartment building forever! (Lays down on Jerry's couch) The dream is dead.
(To his new girlfriend) You see, my dear, all certified mail is registered, but registered mail is not necessarily certified.
Hey, you know this is kind of fun.
Hello Jerry. Well, I may have a solution to our little problem. Elaine, would you excuse us?
Oh no. No no no no. I bought it from Kramer. He was hard up for cash. Fifty bucks! (he laughs) Can you believe it? Of course, I had to make some minor modifications, you know. Solid tires, reinforced seatpost, heavy duty shocks. But, baby, this is one sweet ride.
It's the romance of the Handsome Cab without the guilt or dander of the equine.
The courthouse. You gotta go with me to the courthouse. I'm contesting a ticket today.
It's pretty hot under these lights huh Seinfeld. Pretty....... Hot .
And that failure to become a banker was eating at you. Eating-eating-eating at you inside.
I dont care much for the beach. I freckle. . . . Is that a,..
It looks like your breaking into it like an otter breaking into a clad.
No sir. He did not. But only by thge grace of God. He's in the courtroom today
(singing) Nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine bottle and cans in the trunk, nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine bottles and cans. At ten cents a bottle and ten cents a can, we're pulling in five hundred dollars a man. Nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight bottle and cans in the trunk, nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight bottles and cans. We fill up with gas, we count up our cash!!...
Oh well. Let me perfectly blunt. I don't care for you Costanza. You hang out at the west side of the building with Seinfeld all day and just it up wasting your lives.
I guess there's not much action down there these days.
(Urgent) I need that mail, where is it?!
(Pondering Kramer's plan out loud) They do have an intimate knowledge of the street..
Yeah well, the budget changed, you know. I mean, it might be a good investment.
Are you married right now? (points at Jerry)
Well, I hear it's quite beautiful there this time of year, and of course you know I'm one-quarter French.
(From outside the room) Kramer? Kramer? (Enters Jerry's bedroom) There you are.
We had a deal. Are you reneging out of the deal? Are you reneging? That's a renege.
We had an arguement about me going to Hawaii, and he locked onto my ankle like it was a soup bone. I'm hubbled! I don't think I can do my route - and they're awarding the transfer in two days!
No, no, no. That's not gonna work. Something else.
Easy, Jerry. Steady. You wouldn't want to lose your cool at a time like this.
Well, let me remind you of something. You wouldn't be here if it wasn't for me and my helmet. I saved your life! You would be dead! Dead! You would cease to exist! You would be gone for the rest of eternity! You wouldn't even begin to comprehend what that means!!
(sobbing) Yes, it's been awful. I wanted to tell somebody. (pleading) Help me Kramer! Help me!
Well, I wouldn't hear of it. I said, "Nice try, granny!" And I sent her to the back of the line!
No, no, no, no no. Listen to me. Most days, the post office sends one truckload of mail to the second domestic regional sorting facility in Sagenaw, Michigan.
He's shipping us a rickshaw. It can't miss!
Excuse me Miss Weaver, OH! My god it is you! I.. I've seen your show six times..
Is it?! Ohhh, well if only you'd known, you could have saved some time and given it directly to me! Ha ha ha.
Jerry! What could she possibly see in Jerry? (Walks in front of Kramer and trips over his feet.)
Because right now, I'm the only chance you've got. (Newman giggles nervously. Jerry makes Newman flinch, and his giggling is choked off.)
Him and his little buxom friend Rachel were going at it pretty good in the balcony.
Alright, alright, back, savages. Back! I haven't made my wish yet..
And therein lies the tragedy. For I believe, sadly for you, that there is but one woman meant for each of us. One perfect angel for whom we are put on this earth.
(a touch desperate) Ah, look, I..I'm sorry to bother you, but I'm a US postal worker and my mail truck was just ambushed by a band of backwoods mail-hating survivalists.
And then, just as I'm about to go, these boxes show up at the post office with no labels. No labels, Jerry. You know what that means? Freebies!! I got this great mini-TV and a VCR, oh it's unbelievable.
Cancel! (jumps to feet) Think again, longshanks! I started planning this in nineteen seventy-eight. I put a deposit down on that revolving restaurant that overlooks Times Square, and I booked Christopher Cross.
No, no. I love strong cider. (for the farmer's daughter's benefit) I'm a big, strong, cider guy.
June 14, 1987.... Mets Phillies. We're enjoying a beautiful afternoon in the right field stands when a crucial Hernandez error to a five run Phillies ninth. Cost the Mets the game.
(Kissing the woman) Beauty .. and brains. (they nuzzle noses)
We gotta find that rickshaw. You check the sewers and dumpsters. I'll hit the soup kitchens, bakeries, and smorgasbords.
This photo clearly indicates your involvement in some ill-conceived mail order pornography ring.As does this one found in the same disturbing packet.
The bank. What about your cards and letters?
Damn you Seinfeld. You useless pustule. Um, somebody's got something on the griddle. maybe it's Kramer.
We have some questions we'd like you to answer.
Oh no. Don't tell me. You're gambling again, aren't you? Oh you weak, weak man. Where are you?
So, to what do I owe this unusual invitation?
Because I don't, never have, anything I read was already open.
To Hawaii. The most sought-after postal route of them all. The air is so dewy-sweet you don't even have to like the stamps.. But it's not to be - So, I'm hanging it up.
A banker! A banker! Your Honor, Your Honor, Your Honor...
Well, you've both presented very convincing arguments. On the one hand, Elaine, your promise was given in haste. But was it not still a promise? Hmm?
He must have caught a glimpse of us when I poured that beer on his head.
I see many dogs on my mail route. I'll bet there's not one type of mutt or mongrel I haven't run across.
You know I hear Mr. Steinbrenner can be a bit erratic. I would hate to see him when he's hungry.
Oh, Mother's Day. (inspiration strikes) Wait a second. Mother's Day?!
Well for starters I want a calzone of my own.....
Well, you know how much those records are worth!?
(smug) As a matter of fact, I did.
Are you sure you know where the impound yard is?
Yeah, just the way that I was raised. I'm special.
I did invite you. Your invitation must've gotten ... lost in the mail.
(reluctant) You know, I don't really know that much about uh.. I don't have any.. I don't.. I don't think I know much about that.
So, which one of us is gonna pull?
Well, tootle loo. And nice seeing you again Margaret, goodbye Jerry. Have fun. Hehe
I called in sick. I don't work in the rain.
Clean? Hardly. This looks like a man that isn't happy with his stereo performance.
Hello, Jerry. Say, this yogurt is really something, huh? And it's non-fat! I've been waiting for something like this my whole life! And it's finally here!
Don't despair, my friend. (Newman walks in front of Kramer and trips over his feet. Again.) I won't allow your love to go unrequited. Not like mine.
(to Kramer) You wanna know why you can't go in front first? I'll tell you why. because it signals a breakdown in the social order. Chaos. It reduces us to jungle law.
(Stands up and Sputtering loudly) Kramer! I'm with people.
Tuesday has no feel. Monday has a feel, Friday has a feel, Sunday has a feel....
You see, it'd been his lifelong dream to be a banker and he uh, just the day before he was turned down by another bank. I believe it was the Manufacturer's Hanover on Lexington and 40th Street. That was the third bank to turn him down so I was-I was a little concerned. I wanted to see how he was doing. Well, Your Honor, he was barely audible. But I distinctly recall him say...
Aaah! Aaagh! Aah-aah. Oh, oh the humanity! Aaagh!
