I wanna learn. I want to know why.
He did it right in this bed, Martin. Right in front of you.
I took over his route. And boy, were there a lot of dogs on that route.
Hey, we can't follow him, we're going north to Michigan.
You just got it? Damn, the mail is slow.
Because I don't, never have, anything I read was already open.
Hey, don't listen to him. I mean, we can't afford a detour. Our budget won't hold it.
We had a deal. Are you reneging out of the deal? Are you reneging? That's a renege.
All right. I'm going in. Keep the motor running.
That he may be. But he's outta my life, starting in the year two-thousand. For me, the next millennium must be, Jerry-free!
Hey, we got ten thousand deposit bottles here. I mean, this guy could be going to Arkansas.
Jerry, you better stop her or Ill tell.
And yet, it's perfectly legal to take a man's soul and crush it out like a stale Pall Mall.
Wait a minute. You mean you get five cents here, and ten cents there. You could round up bottles here and run 'em out to Michigan for the difference.
For I am in love with Svetlana, and I don't care if the whole world knows, except for Silvio, who would throw me out of the apartment, where I would be dancing on the sidewalk--
The guy who had the Hawaii transfer got busted for hoarding Victoria Secret catalogues. I gotta deliver that mail!
(to Kramer) You shut up! (to judge) I demand a recess so I can take him outside and help him regain hius composure.
You can't taste 'em . Why waste 'em . Why not give them all to me.
I have a private matter to discuss with my fellow tenants. (Opens door) If you don't mind?
Oh, well it's a good thing for Jerry that you didn't go.
Once I find a barber I stick with him. I almost went to barber school. I always felt I had a talent for it.
Oh no. No no no no. I bought it from Kramer. He was hard up for cash. Fifty bucks! (he laughs) Can you believe it? Of course, I had to make some minor modifications, you know. Solid tires, reinforced seatpost, heavy duty shocks. But, baby, this is one sweet ride.
Yeah. I just hope Tim Whatley's electric bills don't suddenly get lost in the mail, or it could be lights out for him.
Hey, you know this is kind of fun.
He's shipping us a rickshaw. It can't miss!
Oh, how I've waited for this moment. But alas, my heart belongs to another man's wife, and I have given the coat to her.
All my work, my planning, my genius. All for nought.
Hey, another round of strawberry for me and my friends.
(excited) We carry a coupla bags of mail, and the rest is ours!
It was because you hated your father and you would do anything to displease him. Isn't THAT true?
[In Kramer's ear] The old coot's sittin' on a mountain of gold!
Your Honor, I'm only trying to establish Mister Kramer's fragile emotional state, my entire case depends on it.
(a touch desperate) Ah, look, I..I'm sorry to bother you, but I'm a US postal worker and my mail truck was just ambushed by a band of backwoods mail-hating survivalists.
You're telling how your parents pushed you into banking.
Well, it would take a hell of a lot. Because a friend is something you earn.
Reversed?! (Kramer comes hobbling out of the doctors office in pain, after having a vasectomy of his own, and exits. Jerry and Newman look at each other, and bolt for the door themselves.)
Lately, though, I've been, uh, - I've been buying the generic brand of waxed beans. You know, I rip of the label I can hardly tell the difference.
Aww, c'mon, pull over, pull over will ya.
Hey Jerry. Look at all the towels they gave me! I really hit the jackpot! (holding a large stack of towels, Newman pats his face with the top one) Ha, ha, ha.
Do you really want to know what happened? I'll tell you what Happened. She wasn't my type.
Him and his little buxom friend Rachel were going at it pretty good in the balcony.
That guy thought we were a couple of total squares.
No, that's a fur coat! Hey, uh, give me a boost.
Hello Jerry. (to Kramer) What did you say to Elaine? I just got her cancellation in the mail.
Stop it, George, stop it. I was defending your parking.
We had an arguement about me going to Hawaii, and he locked onto my ankle like it was a soup bone. I'm hubbled! I don't think I can do my route - and they're awarding the transfer in two days!
Ah, don't worry about a thing. In twenty minutes that place'll be swarming with mailmen. We'll be back on the street by lunch.
But you never became a banker, did you Mister Kramer? Why? Why did you fail?
Yes! A more offensive spectacle I cannot recall. Anyway I just really came up to get some detergent.
What kind of dog did you say it was?
Hello, Jerry. Tim couldn't make it, he's in love. Isn't that wonderful?
(on the phone in his apartment with a Bald head) Not for a while.
June 14th, 1987. Mets Phillies. You made a big error. Cost the Mets the game. Then you're coming up the parking lot ramp.
(Gesturing to dishes and silverware on the table) But you can clear some of this stuff out of the way.
Oh, Mother's Day. (inspiration strikes) Wait a second. Mother's Day?!
I don't care. It was good. I was enjoying it. Had to interfere. Couldn't leave well enough alone. Well, I will get even with you for this. You can count on it.
(breaking from his pose) Can I have some gravy?
So we could put the bottles in a U-haul. You know, go lean and mean?
(thinking to himself; checks a comb) No. (checks a brush) Jackpot. I don't believe this. There's no hair in this thing. I've never seen a person that didn't have at least one hair in a brush.
There's another way it can go down, and it's going down right now!
(leaving) Oh, by the way, what are you doing for the Super Bowl?
Jerry! What could she possibly see in Jerry? (Walks in front of Kramer and trips over his feet.)
The mother of all mail days. And guess who signed up for the truck.
(to Kramer) That's where my missing soda is.
Alright then, I guess I can accept a little Jerry, if it gets me a (suggestive) lot of Elaine.
(smug) As a matter of fact, I did.
You are nothing but a piece of crap.
Well, you've both presented very convincing arguments. On the one hand, Elaine, your promise was given in haste. But was it not still a promise? Hmm?
No, no, no. That's not gonna work. Something else.
All right! All right. I wont say anything.
What's the matter with you? I just talked to you fifteen minutes ago.
And one more thing. I'm not coming to your party. (exits)
What makes you think I'm lookin' for trouble?
Well he really seemed to have his hands full if you know what I mean.
So I sped home to save my friend's life and I was stopped for speeding. Yes, I admit I was speeding but it was to save a man's life. A close friend. An innocent person who wanted nothing more out of life than to love, to be loved and to be a banker.
Look, I don't have time to explain every little thing to you.
And, Kramer, you did provide a service in exchange for compensation. But, does the fee, once paid, not entitle the buyer to some assurance Of reliability? Hmm? Huh? Ahh. These were not easy questions to answer. Not for any man...
(moving away from the counter getting closer to the door) Hello Jerry.
So what? Do you know whose mailbag that is?
Well, you know how much those records are worth!?
Tuesday has no feel. Monday has a feel, Friday has a feel, Sunday has a feel....
I hope you realise what you've done. You've destroyed our whole venture.
Aaah! Aaagh! Aah-aah. Oh, oh the humanity! Aaagh!
(sings) You're once. Twice. Three times a lady.
(Thinks for a moment) I guess you're right. It's just walking around putting it into boxes..
Yea, it's the wood that makes it good.
Well, h ha ha- if you're happy with her, that's all that matters.
I went through all those bottles and all those cans, for what? What a waste. And I'm really gonna catch hell for those missing mailbags.
I see many dogs on my mail route. I'll bet there's not one type of mutt or mongrel I haven't run across.
I can't sleep, I tell you! I can't sleep!
Are you sure you know where the impound yard is?
...it takes just as much man-power to deliver it as their precious little greeting cards...
A banker! A banker! Your Honor, Your Honor, Your Honor...
He's giving away what's left! I gotta go home and get a big pot!
(Strangling Kramer) What's the matter with you? We had it all worked out!
It was a cinch. Where are you going?
You heard me. So he packed it up and split for the coast. La-La Land. L.A.
Not so fast, Elaine! Only the bike's true owner would rather give it away than see it come to harm. Kramer, the bike is yours!
Don't despair, my friend. (Newman walks in front of Kramer and trips over his feet. Again.) I won't allow your love to go unrequited. Not like mine.
(smugly) That is seven dollars and twenty-two cents better.
(To his new girlfriend) You see, my dear, all certified mail is registered, but registered mail is not necessarily certified.
Okay, you're all set? You got your story?
It's pretty hot under these lights huh Seinfeld. Pretty....... Hot .
Gladly. (starts munching on the broccoli, then spits it out)
Are you going to give me back that helmet or not?
Well, there is a little something you can do for me...
Kind of. I'm still collecting checks, I'm just not delivering mail.
Is it?! Ohhh, well if only you'd known, you could have saved some time and given it directly to me! Ha ha ha.
I could give you my uniform from my rookie year.
Hey, hey maybe I should go with him?
Well, I'm not paying the five cents for that stupid recycling thing.
I had gone up to Westchester. I go there every Tuesday. I do charity for the blind in my spare time for the Lighthouse. I was in the middle of a game of Parcheesi with an old blind man and I excused myself to call my friend as he was very depressed lately because he never became a banker.
Gotta go. Oh gee, I dropped a nickel (reaches down and picks up the hair.)
Elaine's down there causing all kinds of commotion. Somehow she got a hold of his recipes and she says she's gonna drive him out of business! The Soup Nazi said that now that his recipes are out, he's not gonna make anymore soup! He's moving out of the country, moving to Argentina! No more soup, Jerry! No more for of us!
Uh ah (stops her from closing the door; walks in) Having a nice trip? (walks over, grabs a junior mint, smells it then puts it in his pocket)
One winsome tulip we ceaselessly yearn for throughout our dreary, workaday lives! And you, my friend, have found your angel. I can tell. For my heart has also been captured by a breathless beauty - whom I fear I will never possess.
I dont care much for the beach. I freckle. . . . Is that a,..
(interrogating Kramer) Mister Kramer, you heard the testimony so far. Would you please tell the court in your own words what happened on the afternoon of September 10th?
Pilot? So what do you make for something like that? Fifty? Sixty thousand?
Quite frankly, I don't see how it's any of your business.
Oh, can I watch a little? Cuz it's my favorite movie.
You know, those mail bags, they get mighty heavy. I uh, I Nautilus, of course. (puffs out his chest)
No. I need a really pretty face. But, Hey, that's me.
(With a gorgeous woman sitting on his lap) Did I?
I did invite you. Your invitation must've gotten ... lost in the mail.
You've come at a bad time now. Could you come back later?
You gotta go with me. I mean, you-you're my alibi. You have to take the stand.
What, do I have to spell it out for ya? He was moving on her like the storm-troopers into Poland.
(Kissing the woman) Beauty .. and brains. (they nuzzle noses)
Jerry, George. [To Kramer] So, did you ask him about the records?
Banker! So you're killing yourself because your dreams of becoming a banker have gone unfulfilled. You-you-you-you can't live without being a banker.
(Sinister) All right, all right. All right you go ahead. You go ahead and keep it secret. But you remember this. When you control the mail, you control... information.
Maybe we could uh, stop for a snack.
Are you married right now? (points at Jerry)
So , you have fleas. Maybe you keep your house in a state of disrepair. Maybe you live in squalor.
If you ask me, they have no business living amongst us. Vile, USELESS BEASTS . . .
"Pam." I don't know the woman, but she sounds quite fetching.
Well, let me remind you of something. You wouldn't be here if it wasn't for me and my helmet. I saved your life! You would be dead! Dead! You would cease to exist! You would be gone for the rest of eternity! You wouldn't even begin to comprehend what that means!!
(squeezing himself through the narrow space) Nothing, just being neighborly. Do you wanna hang out? Shoot the breeze?
Sorry , last one . Would you want to suck the pit?
Well, you should take a look at my rug then.
I cant eat fruit. It makes me incontinent.
All right, I'm going to need a clean 8 ounce glass.
We're making a trade. I'm giving him my motorcycle helmet - he's giving me his radar detector.
We have some questions we'd like you to answer.
Well why do we have to keep this from Jerry?
Well, I wouldn't hear of it. I said, "Nice try, granny!" And I sent her to the back of the line!
Cancel! (jumps to feet) Think again, longshanks! I started planning this in nineteen seventy-eight. I put a deposit down on that revolving restaurant that overlooks Times Square, and I booked Christopher Cross.
And that failure to become a banker was eating at you. Eating-eating-eating at you inside.
The reverse peepholes. Silvio said I'm an agitator and I'm out of the building.
Yeah well, the budget changed, you know. I mean, it might be a good investment.
You wanna know what happened to Kramer? I'll tell you what happened to Kramer. He was ticked off. About the keys. Yeah, that's right - about the keys. Thought he got a bad rap.
I WANT MY HELMET BACK! GIVE ME BACK MY HELMET AND YOU'RE GOING TO PAY FOR THAT TICKET.
It's gorgeous water. (pause) Do we own Bermuda?
Every night I sleep in a really hot room, I don't want to kill myself.
Well, ELAINE, There's any number of things I could do. But, I can promise you this, though, this vicious beast will never bother you again. So, what's it going to be?
Exactly. You're a disgrace to the uniform. (Newman takes off Jerry's mailman hat. Jerry turns his head in shame. Newman then tears the post office badge from Jerry's coat)
The courthouse. You gotta go with me to the courthouse. I'm contesting a ticket today.
(sobbing) Yes, it's been awful. I wanted to tell somebody. (pleading) Help me Kramer! Help me!
(Stands up) Too many people go their mail! Close to 80%. No body from the post office has ever cracked the 50% barrier! It's like the 3-minute mile!
All right, all right. I'll help you but I will except something in return.
(to Kramer) You wanna know why you can't go in front first? I'll tell you why. because it signals a breakdown in the social order. Chaos. It reduces us to jungle law.
All right, all right. Go ahead, go ahead.
Yeah? Well, you bombed! That story stunk worse than these chairs!
I was speaking earlier with Kramer and he mentioned something about a private jet to Paris?
Alright, go ahead and hit me, Seinfeld. I got witnesses.
The bank. What about your cards and letters?
I have a carpet sweeper you can use.
Yuh, yes. I intend to Your Honor. And then, on the afternoon of September 10th, you received a phone call did you not?
Of course. Take your time. I be here.
Oh yes, in fact I still have family there. This probably won't interest you, but I have a cousin there who's suffering very badly. She's lost all use of her muscles. She can only communicate by blinking. I would so love to see her - bring a ray of sunshine into her tragic life. But alas, I can't afford it, for I am, as you know, but a simple postal worker.
This photo clearly indicates your involvement in some ill-conceived mail order pornography ring.As does this one found in the same disturbing packet.
Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry.
And a slice of pepperoni pizza and a large soda and three times a week I will require a canolie.
Don't you have a-a boyfriend? A, uh, burly, athletic type?
Yes I am, a guy on my mail route just got a couple of tickets and he offered one to me.
Not going to play ball. Huh all right. Admit it that stereo was all ready busted.
I usually do. (Gets up to leave) See ya.
Can't do it. I'm on an unbelievable birthday-wish hot streak! My last five birthday wishes came true.
Jerry wouldn't know delicate beauty if it bludgeoned him over the head.
Hellooo Jerry. What a rare treat. What brings you down to the east wing?
Hello, Jerry. Say, this yogurt is really something, huh? And it's non-fat! I've been waiting for something like this my whole life! And it's finally here!
Well for starters I want a calzone of my own.....
You know, old friend, sometimes I ponder this silly gulf between us and I say, "Why?" Are we really so different. For what is--
All right give it to me. let go ...
Great streak of luck I'm having. First, Kramer almost beat me at Risk but I narrowly escaped, and then Tim Whatley gives me his Super Bowl ticket.
Well, I suppose if you got ten car lengths.
But, on the week before holidays, we see a surge. On alentine's Day, we send two trucks. On Christmas, four, packed to the brim. And tomorrow, if history is any guide, will see some spillover into a fifth truck.
No, no. I love strong cider. (for the farmer's daughter's benefit) I'm a big, strong, cider guy.
Well if you watch closely enough, you just might see me. I'll be the one waving to the camera from my seat on the forty yard line.
Fleas? Bwa ha ha ha ha .That's preposterous. How can I , give you fleas. Now if you don't mind...
June 14, 1987.... Mets Phillies. We're enjoying a beautiful afternoon in the right field stands when a crucial Hernandez error to a five run Phillies ninth. Cost the Mets the game.
Look, sister, go get yourself a cup of coffee, all right? Beat it! (Pushes Elaine out the door and closes it) All right, now here's the lowdown. From a certain connection, I've been able to locate some black market shower heads. They're all made in the former Yugoslavia, and from what I hear the Serbs are fanatic about their showers.
He cant hear you, you idiot. Why dont you just buy another one.
If I'm curt, then I appologize. But as I understand it, we have a situation here and time is of the essence.
(peering at bottle label) What is this 'MI, ten cents'?
(reluctant) You know, I don't really know that much about uh.. I don't have any.. I don't.. I don't think I know much about that.
I'm not beaten yet. I still have armies in the Ukraine.
Well, I hear it's quite beautiful there this time of year, and of course you know I'm one-quarter French.
He must have caught a glimpse of us when I poured that beer on his head.
Damn you Seinfeld. You useless pustule. Um, somebody's got something on the griddle. maybe it's Kramer.
What you need me in the car for?
A radar detector, as I understand it, DETECTS RADAR! WITH A SERIES OF BEEPS AND FLASHING LIGHTS. But oddly, for some reason I didn't hear a thing except for the sound of a police siren.
Is this or is this not your signature?
(seeing postal security officials walking towards Kramer) Quick! Get in!
There's no need to get excited. Can't we discuss this like gentlemen?
I don't know. The man makes a pretty strong bird.
(To Rusty) Alright, uh, take it down to the end of the block. Make a controlled turn, and bring her back. Let's see what you've got! Ok? Ready, and go!
Clean? Hardly. This looks like a man that isn't happy with his stereo performance.
Those records are worth more than five dollars!
Yes. It's called mail fraud. Oohhhh. How I've longed for this moment Seinfeld. The day when I would have the proof I needed to hall you out of your cushy lair and expose to the light of justice as the monster that you are. A monster so vile.....
I'm homeless! I'm gonna be out on a street corner, dancing for nickels. I'll be with the hobos in the trainyard, eating out of a bucket.
Come on lets go. I got the helmet. Lets get the radar detector.
South America?! (to Jerry) What kind of snow blower you get us mixed up with?
Hey, hey, hey. (to Jerry) I hear you've got some lip reader working for you. You gotta let me use her for one day. Just one day.
So, which one of us is gonna pull?
Yes, yes. May I go? Cause I gotta go very badly.
I know you know, but you don't know what I know.
Mmm. You present an interesting dilemma. Each of you seemingly has a legitimate claim to the bicycle, and yet the bicycle can have only one rightful owner. Quite the conundrum. As a federal employee, I believe the law is all we have. (getting worked up) It's all that separates us from the savages who don't deserve even the privilege of the daily mail. (angry) Stuffing parcels into mailboxes where they don't belong!!...
That was the Vice President of the post office. I didn't get the transfer.. They knew it wasn't me doing my route!
We'll pay anything. We've got the (hands a wad of money to Kramer) What about Jerry?
Well, it's-it's interesting work, I don't mind it.
All right, it's true! Of course nobody needs mail. What do you think, you're so clever for figuring that out? But you don't know the half of what goes on here. So just walk away, Kramer. I beg of you.
Now, you're that firend. Now, all we need is a reason why you were going to commit suicide.
Excuse me Miss Weaver, OH! My god it is you! I.. I've seen your show six times..
Hello, Jerry. Will he take it? I gotta go to work.
What keeps the water in there? I mean, why doesn't it disappear?
No sir. He did not. But only by thge grace of God. He's in the courtroom today
I hope you know what you're doing... (Kramer gives Newman a look of lack of confidence)
If we put our three heads together we should come up with something.
That's good stuff, and you can never have too much ice. Alright, I'll tell you what I'll do. You can co-host the party with me, under one condition. No Jerry. Jerry is not invited.
Oh, don't you? Joke boy? You really think you can manipulate that beautiful young woman like the half-soused nightclub rabble that lap up your inane "observations"?
No! And no one will ever see you again!
Oh no. Don't tell me. You're gambling again, aren't you? Oh you weak, weak man. Where are you?
Look, you said the one in the second courtyard. He was in the second courtyard.
(mouth full) It's delicious mutton. This is uh, this is outta sight. I would, I would love to get the recipe. It's very good.
You know I hear Mr. Steinbrenner can be a bit erratic. I would hate to see him when he's hungry.
It was your family that pushed you into banking , it was their dream for you...
It's the romance of the Handsome Cab without the guilt or dander of the equine.
Kramer you might as well run along. Jerry might be a while. Suspicion of mail fraud.
How much longer you gonna be, I'm starving here.
With your looks and my words, we'll have built the perfect beast. (Kramer claps him on the shoulder, then goes to the other side of the aisle to talk to Pam.)
You dated her. Give me some inside information. Anything I can use!
All right! But hear me and hear me well - The day will come. Oh yes, mark my words, Seinfeld - your day of reckoning is coming. When an evil wind will blow through your little playworld, and wipe that smug smile off your face. And I'll be there, in all my glory, watching - watching as it all comes crumbling down.
"Do not bend". (Laughs evilly) Just crease, crumple, cram.. you'll do fine. (Phone rings. Newman answers it) Hello?.. This is he. I don't understand.. very well. (Hangs up in disappointment)
Take it or leave it!? We got *Al Jolson* here, *Al Jolson*!!
Ah, she just didn't do it for me.
(pushing past Kramer) Kramer, help me! Help me!
Not so fast pretty boy. There is more to this sorted little affair.
(Cannot take this torture anymore) Baaaaaaaaarrhhhhhhhhhhh....I'm ripped with fleas ( scratches furiously)
Hello Jerry. Well, I may have a solution to our little problem. Elaine, would you excuse us?
All right. Then let me ask you this. Didn't you find it interesting that your friend had the foresight to purchase postal insurance for your stereo. Huh. I mean parcels are rarely damaged during shipping.
You're in trouble, Kramer. I shouldn't even be talking to you, but I'm telling you as a friend. Here's how it's going to happen you may be walking. Maybe on a crisp, autumn day just like today. When a mail truck will slow beside you, and a door will open, and a mailman you know, maybe even trust, will offer to give you a lift.
Ahh! This is very much as I imagined it to be. Aside from this rattan piece, which seems oddly out of place.
Well, don't tarry. I'm behind schedule as it is.
(reluctant) You don't wanna do your... act, or anything, do you?
Well, you'll never guess what happened to me today. I was uh, driving ( Jerry and Kramer turn away) home on the palisades parkway when I looked in the rear view mirror and what did I see? The fuzz. And it's funny because my new radar detector was on. I didn't hear a thing. Isn't that strange?
It looks like your breaking into it like an otter breaking into a clad.
I know how you feel. For I, too, have a woman for whom I pine.
I called in sick. I don't work in the rain.
Why I didn't see you at Schindler's List with Jerry.
Then I turned and the spit ricochet of him and it hit me.
I just heard that a postman spotted a rickshaw down in Battery Park.
I hope he stays this happy when he wakes up.
And then, just as I'm about to go, these boxes show up at the post office with no labels. No labels, Jerry. You know what that means? Freebies!! I got this great mini-TV and a VCR, oh it's unbelievable.
We gotta find that rickshaw. You check the sewers and dumpsters. I'll hit the soup kitchens, bakeries, and smorgasbords.
You know, when you think about it, it's kind of silly for us both to pull this thing all t he way back uptown. I mean, after all, it is a conveyance.
Well, it's her mistake. Because she is going to miss the party of a lifetime.
Aahh! You're great,It's great, It's so great to see a show that's (looks at Jerry) about something.
You gave me a defective detector. ... Jerry?
Well, tootle loo. And nice seeing you again Margaret, goodbye Jerry. Have fun. Hehe
I know exactly how he feels. Pleasure doing business with you. Do come again. Ha, ha, ha, ha.
No, no, no, no no. Listen to me. Most days, the post office sends one truckload of mail to the second domestic regional sorting facility in Sagenaw, Michigan.
Easy, Jerry. Steady. You wouldn't want to lose your cool at a time like this.
(singing) Nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine bottle and cans in the trunk, nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine bottles and cans. At ten cents a bottle and ten cents a can, we're pulling in five hundred dollars a man. Nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight bottle and cans in the trunk, nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight bottles and cans. We fill up with gas, we count up our cash!!...
Hey! You're not dumping those bottles back there, are you?
I guess there's not much action down there these days.
Hey! What are you doing? It's after six o'clock! You can't give me a ticket! Hey, you're not gonna get away with this. I'll fight this. I got witnesses.
Yeah, just the way that I was raised. I'm special.
Hey Kramer, those have wholesale value! We could cut our losses.
(Stands up and Sputtering loudly) Kramer! I'm with people.
Sorry. But love is spice with many tastes. A dizzying array of textures...and moments.
Because right now, I'm the only chance you've got. (Newman giggles nervously. Jerry makes Newman flinch, and his giggling is choked off.)
...But I have made a decision. (revelatory) We will cut the bike down the middle, and give half to each of you.
ha ha ha Well you know sometimes it just has a way of finding you. Cigarette?
So, to what do I owe this unusual invitation?
Oh well. Let me perfectly blunt. I don't care for you Costanza. You hang out at the west side of the building with Seinfeld all day and just it up wasting your lives.
When the cop stopped me, I told him that I was rushing home because my friend was about to commit suicide.
... a man can really get some thinking done. (sits on couch, next to Kramer.)
A second later, something happened that changed us in a deep and profound way front that day forward.
