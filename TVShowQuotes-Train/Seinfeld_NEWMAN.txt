Who's talking to you?
I believe the deal was that I get the calzones on my mail route. Well today I won't be going on my mail route! Will I. Perhaps tomorrow.
On my mothers life.
(leaving) Oh, by the way, what are you doing for the Super Bowl?
Who?
Are you sure you know where the impound yard is?
Yes I am, a guy on my mail route just got a couple of tickets and he offered one to me.
(enters) KEITH HERNANDEZ?
And why was that?
No, no, no, no no. Listen to me. Most days, the post office sends one truckload of mail to the second domestic regional sorting facility in Sagenaw, Michigan.
What took you so long?
Yes, yes. May I go? Cause I gotta go very badly.
[In Kramer's ear] The old coot's sittin' on a mountain of gold!
(Urgent) I need that mail, where is it?!
They're gonna beat me up!
(To his new girlfriend) You see, my dear, all certified mail is registered, but registered mail is not necessarily certified.
We made quite a haul.
I could give you my uniform from my rookie year.
I told you he was a risk.
Thank you. [inhaling deeply] Jambalaya!
I HAD a girlfriend and she was pretty wild.
I know how you feel. For I, too, have a woman for whom I pine.
On what?
Elaine's down there causing all kinds of commotion. Somehow she got a hold of his recipes and she says she's gonna drive him out of business! The Soup Nazi said that now that his recipes are out, he's not gonna make anymore soup! He's moving out of the country, moving to Argentina! No more soup, Jerry! No more for of us!
A piece of crap.
I have done nothing unethical.
No.
Gladly. (starts munching on the broccoli, then spits it out)
Sometimes...
Five dollars. He offered us *five* dollars.
Your nipple's showing.
We got no one!
Hello Mrs. Seinfeld
Blast! There's no way I can handle 8 in addition to my ususal load of one! I'll never get to Hawaii! (Moves over to Jerry's couch, depressed) I'll be stuck in this apartment building forever! (Lays down on Jerry's couch) The dream is dead.
He's giving away what's left! I gotta go home and get a big pot!
You lookin' for someone?
You were going to...
Can't we worry about them later?
He cant hear you, you idiot. Why dont you just buy another one.
Aww, c'mon, pull over, pull over will ya.
You certainly are in a bind.
Oh, well it's a good thing for Jerry that you didn't go.
You go.
Damn you Seinfeld. You useless pustule. Um, somebody's got something on the griddle. maybe it's Kramer.
HELP! (Elaine enters.)
Sometimes we don't get what we want.
Ahh! This is very much as I imagined it to be. Aside from this rattan piece, which seems oddly out of place.
When the cop stopped me, I told him that I was rushing home because my friend was about to commit suicide.
I just heard that a postman spotted a rickshaw down in Battery Park.
Lucky krauts.
Gentlemen, gentlemen. I am so happy to see you both. There is just some inconsistencies I'd like to straighten out.
(triumphant) Yessss!
I use dental tape.
...But, you must promise That you will abide by my decision, no matter how unjust it may seem to either of you. Do I have your word?
Well, h ha ha- if you're happy with her, that's all that matters.
I don't understand. You fill an eighteen-wheeler?
All right, give me the rope.
And, Kramer, you did provide a service in exchange for compensation. But, does the fee, once paid, not entitle the buyer to some assurance Of reliability? Hmm? Huh? Ahh. These were not easy questions to answer. Not for any man...
Ill bring him up to date.
Fourty-nine.
Jerry wouldn't know delicate beauty if it bludgeoned him over the head.
(singing) Nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine bottle and cans in the trunk, nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine bottles and cans. At ten cents a bottle and ten cents a can, we're pulling in five hundred dollars a man. Nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight bottle and cans in the trunk, nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight bottles and cans. We fill up with gas, we count up our cash!!...
Yeah. I just hope Tim Whatley's electric bills don't suddenly get lost in the mail, or it could be lights out for him.
Don't despair, my friend. (Newman walks in front of Kramer and trips over his feet. Again.) I won't allow your love to go unrequited. Not like mine.
Is that Jerry's number?
(To Rusty) Alright, uh, take it down to the end of the block. Make a controlled turn, and bring her back. Let's see what you've got! Ok? Ready, and go!
All right, all right. I'll help you but I will except something in return.
Kramer bit me!
Well if you watch closely enough, you just might see me. I'll be the one waving to the camera from my seat on the forty yard line.
Wow, it was McDowell.
We had a deal. Are you reneging out of the deal? Are you reneging? That's a renege.
So, which one of us is gonna pull?
Stop it, George, stop it. I was defending your parking.
If I'm curt, then I appologize. But as I understand it, we have a situation here and time is of the essence.
The mother of all mail days. And guess who signed up for the truck.
Hey Jerry. Look at all the towels they gave me! I really hit the jackpot! (holding a large stack of towels, Newman pats his face with the top one) Ha, ha, ha.
Yes! A more offensive spectacle I cannot recall. Anyway I just really came up to get some detergent.
Yeah.
There's another way it can go down, and it's going down right now!
Work? It's raining.
Oooh,
Olly, olly, oxen, free!
Well, tootle loo. And nice seeing you again Margaret, goodbye Jerry. Have fun. Hehe
eue-aaa.
Oh no, no, not the bag!
Well sure it would.
Is this or is this not your signature?
Hey! What are you doing? It's after six o'clock! You can't give me a ticket! Hey, you're not gonna get away with this. I'll fight this. I got witnesses.
We'll pay anything. We've got the (hands a wad of money to Kramer) What about Jerry?
Hello Jerry. (to Kramer) So, any news?
Yeah, yeah.
Wow, where did you get that?
Uh, you, uh, you better put something on.
What d'you mean it doesn't work? You get enough bottles together...
Blast!
Is it?! Ohhh, well if only you'd known, you could have saved some time and given it directly to me! Ha ha ha.
Uh ah (stops her from closing the door; walks in) Having a nice trip? (walks over, grabs a junior mint, smells it then puts it in his pocket)
Fleas? Bwa ha ha ha ha .That's preposterous. How can I , give you fleas. Now if you don't mind...
(salivating) Turkey?
You tried it?
I can't eat this.
Well, you should take a look at my rug then.
That he may be. But he's outta my life, starting in the year two-thousand. For me, the next millennium must be, Jerry-free!
Mind your pace, Boy. Chop, chop!
Look, I don't have time to explain every little thing to you.
Number 67, right here, right here!
The guy who had the Hawaii transfer got busted for hoarding Victoria Secret catalogues. I gotta deliver that mail!
Take it or leave it!? We got *Al Jolson* here, *Al Jolson*!!
What're you doing?
I'm on the roof!
Hello, Jerry. Will he take it? I gotta go to work.
Can't do it. I'm on an unbelievable birthday-wish hot streak! My last five birthday wishes came true.
You wanna know what happened to Kramer? I'll tell you what happened to Kramer. He was ticked off. About the keys. Yeah, that's right - about the keys. Thought he got a bad rap.
(To Jerry) Good night.
They follow him like a cult.
Your Honor, I'm only trying to establish Mister Kramer's fragile emotional state, my entire case depends on it.
From me!
Yes, a phone call!
With your looks and my words, we'll have built the perfect beast. (Kramer claps him on the shoulder, then goes to the other side of the aisle to talk to Pam.)
Who made you the leader?
You can't taste 'em . Why waste 'em . Why not give them all to me.
You might say that.
Oh, Mother's Day. (inspiration strikes) Wait a second. Mother's Day?!
You gotta go with me. I mean, you-you're my alibi. You have to take the stand.
Well for starters I want a calzone of my own.....
It's getting cold, it's getting cold.
Well, let me remind you of something. You wouldn't be here if it wasn't for me and my helmet. I saved your life! You would be dead! Dead! You would cease to exist! You would be gone for the rest of eternity! You wouldn't even begin to comprehend what that means!!
(Negotiating) Your next, fifty wishes.
Uh..
(a touch desperate) Ah, look, I..I'm sorry to bother you, but I'm a US postal worker and my mail truck was just ambushed by a band of backwoods mail-hating survivalists.
Uh-Huh.
Well, I suppose if you got ten car lengths.
(With a gorgeous woman sitting on his lap) Did I?
Crazy Joe Davola?
I hope he stays this happy when he wakes up.
Well why do we have to keep this from Jerry?
Hi Babs
If you ask me, they have no business living amongst us. Vile, USELESS BEASTS . . .
To the Newmanniun! (holds out his hand)
Hee hee! Yeah yeah!
Are you going to give me back that helmet or not?
Well, it's-it's interesting work, I don't mind it.
Hello, Jerry. Say, this yogurt is really something, huh? And it's non-fat! I've been waiting for something like this my whole life! And it's finally here!
There's no need to get excited. Can't we discuss this like gentlemen?
What for, you got your own.
South America?! (to Jerry) What kind of snow blower you get us mixed up with?
Ah, don't worry about a thing. In twenty minutes that place'll be swarming with mailmen. We'll be back on the street by lunch.
It gets my rug clean.
Aww..
I don't see any pie...
Exactly. You're a disgrace to the uniform. (Newman takes off Jerry's mailman hat. Jerry turns his head in shame. Newman then tears the post office badge from Jerry's coat)
Why? I'll tell you why...
You know, when you think about it, it's kind of silly for us both to pull this thing all t he way back uptown. I mean, after all, it is a conveyance.
Because right now, I'm the only chance you've got. (Newman giggles nervously. Jerry makes Newman flinch, and his giggling is choked off.)
The bank. What about your cards and letters?
I'm not beaten yet. I still have armies in the Ukraine.
(reluctant) You don't wanna do your... act, or anything, do you?
Lately, though, I've been, uh, - I've been buying the generic brand of waxed beans. You know, I rip of the label I can hardly tell the difference.
You dated her. Give me some inside information. Anything I can use!
You're gyppin' us!
It was a real melee.
Mmm. You present an interesting dilemma. Each of you seemingly has a legitimate claim to the bicycle, and yet the bicycle can have only one rightful owner. Quite the conundrum. As a federal employee, I believe the law is all we have. (getting worked up) It's all that separates us from the savages who don't deserve even the privilege of the daily mail. (angry) Stuffing parcels into mailboxes where they don't belong!!...
Son of Sam. The worst mass murderer the post office ever produced.
Ohh, were you there?
Well that's the way it happened.
You see, it'd been his lifelong dream to be a banker and he uh, just the day before he was turned down by another bank. I believe it was the Manufacturer's Hanover on Lexington and 40th Street. That was the third bank to turn him down so I was-I was a little concerned. I wanted to see how he was doing. Well, Your Honor, he was barely audible. But I distinctly recall him say...
Oh well. Let me perfectly blunt. I don't care for you Costanza. You hang out at the west side of the building with Seinfeld all day and just it up wasting your lives.
Yuh, yes. I intend to Your Honor. And then, on the afternoon of September 10th, you received a phone call did you not?
Go on.
It was your family that pushed you into banking , it was their dream for you...
Hello Jerry. Well, I may have a solution to our little problem. Elaine, would you excuse us?
Yeah? Well, you bombed! That story stunk worse than these chairs!
(Scared) Boy.. Boy. Kramer!
Gangway!
How much gas we got?
He's out.
Are you married right now? (points at Jerry)
It's Newman.
Are you crazy?
It's about...Elaine.
Okay, we'll go with the banker story.
Minding my own business.
(Gesturing to dishes and silverware on the table) But you can clear some of this stuff out of the way.
Pilot? So what do you make for something like that? Fifty? Sixty thousand?
I knew you'd back out.
I don't care. It was good. I was enjoying it. Had to interfere. Couldn't leave well enough alone. Well, I will get even with you for this. You can count on it.
There it is!
This photo clearly indicates your involvement in some ill-conceived mail order pornography ring.As does this one found in the same disturbing packet.
Frequently.
Yeah. Maybe.
Alright, let's begin.
All right give it to me. let go ...
Well my girlfriend had one.
Kramer.
Excuse me Miss Weaver, OH! My god it is you! I.. I've seen your show six times..
( resumes eating) Well that's a shame.
And therein lies the tragedy. For I believe, sadly for you, that there is but one woman meant for each of us. One perfect angel for whom we are put on this earth.
Never.
Hello Jerry.
What do you think? Drive. Drive.
Hey, what's up?
We had an arguement about me going to Hawaii, and he locked onto my ankle like it was a soup bone. I'm hubbled! I don't think I can do my route - and they're awarding the transfer in two days!
Hello Jerry, may I come in?
Tuesday has no feel. Monday has a feel, Friday has a feel, Sunday has a feel....
It was McDowell.
Hey! You're not dumping those bottles back there, are you?
Woah.
(screaming in panic) Aaah!! Aaah!
(Thinks for a moment) I guess you're right. It's just walking around putting it into boxes..
(defensive) What're you talking about...
To Hawaii. The most sought-after postal route of them all. The air is so dewy-sweet you don't even have to like the stamps.. But it's not to be - So, I'm hanging it up.
What the hell was that?
Jerry?
Coy? I'm not being coy.
I like the thick tape.
I usually do. (Gets up to leave) See ya.
It's entirely possible.
I can't believe I'm being evicted.
No! And no one will ever see you again!
I wanna learn. I want to know why.
Hello, boys.
Something's happened with the Soup Nazi!
Go girl!
Well, don't tarry. I'm behind schedule as it is.
Hey, hey, hey. (to Jerry) I hear you've got some lip reader working for you. You gotta let me use her for one day. Just one day.
And a slice of pepperoni pizza and a large soda and three times a week I will require a canolie.
You will!
Not so fast pretty boy. There is more to this sorted little affair.
(sobbing) Yes, it's been awful. I wanted to tell somebody. (pleading) Help me Kramer! Help me!
(breaking from his pose) Can I have some gravy?
(Realizing) Damn!
Yeah, sure.
And that failure to become a banker was eating at you. Eating-eating-eating at you inside.
Nevertheless, sometime this afternoon, behind the Market Diner, an unmarked van will be waiting. I'm expecting the call at any time. Are you in?
Hello?
...But I have made a decision. (revelatory) We will cut the bike down the middle, and give half to each of you.
(surprised) Kramer.
The airport?
We're making a trade. I'm giving him my motorcycle helmet - he's giving me his radar detector.
You know what I mean.
You're in trouble, Kramer. I shouldn't even be talking to you, but I'm telling you as a friend. Here's how it's going to happen you may be walking. Maybe on a crisp, autumn day just like today. When a mail truck will slow beside you, and a door will open, and a mailman you know, maybe even trust, will offer to give you a lift.
Why, because I use dental tape?
Care for some lemonade?
Yes, sir, I believe everything is all squared away. Isn't it, Mr. Kramer?
What are you doing?
Yes. No, wait! OK, yes.
ha ha ha Well you know sometimes it just has a way of finding you. Cigarette?
All right! But hear me and hear me well - The day will come. Oh yes, mark my words, Seinfeld - your day of reckoning is coming. When an evil wind will blow through your little playworld, and wipe that smug smile off your face. And I'll be there, in all my glory, watching - watching as it all comes crumbling down.
Him and his little buxom friend Rachel were going at it pretty good in the balcony.
Jerry!
Butter. Kramer. Butter. Kramer.
No. I need a really pretty face. But, Hey, that's me.
That guy thought we were a couple of total squares.
No reason.
You must!
I didn't get my transfer.
You just got it? Damn, the mail is slow.
The Pacific Northwest.
... a man can really get some thinking done. (sits on couch, next to Kramer.)
What keeps the water in there? I mean, why doesn't it disappear?
(on the phone in his apartment with a Bald head) Not for a while.
You're off your rocker.
But it's your house.
Hello Jerry. (to Kramer) What did you say to Elaine? I just got her cancellation in the mail.
And yet, it's perfectly legal to take a man's soul and crush it out like a stale Pall Mall.
(Together) Sucker..
I had gone up to Westchester. I go there every Tuesday. I do charity for the blind in my spare time for the Lighthouse. I was in the middle of a game of Parcheesi with an old blind man and I excused myself to call my friend as he was very depressed lately because he never became a banker.
Yep.
We din, we didn't ... ... Cosmo?
After you.
Gotta go. Oh gee, I dropped a nickel (reaches down and picks up the hair.)
What about your bills?
There will be a small fine.
You know, those mail bags, they get mighty heavy. I uh, I Nautilus, of course. (puffs out his chest)
Yeah, I suppose.
???????
Yeah well, the budget changed, you know. I mean, it might be a good investment.
Alright, well be back... *jack*!
Kramer you might as well run along. Jerry might be a while. Suspicion of mail fraud.
Hey, you want me to mail it? I'm on my way out anyway.
Of course. Obviously.
Hi. How are you?
...it takes just as much man-power to deliver it as their precious little greeting cards...
Yes...
Why I didn't see you at Schindler's List with Jerry.
I swear.
I went through all those bottles and all those cans, for what? What a waste. And I'm really gonna catch hell for those missing mailbags.
Twenty bucks?!? Are you out of your mind?
All right, it's true! Of course nobody needs mail. What do you think, you're so clever for figuring that out? But you don't know the half of what goes on here. So just walk away, Kramer. I beg of you.
Butter?
Anyway.
Nah.
Right.
June 14th, 1987. Mets Phillies. You made a big error. Cost the Mets the game. Then you're coming up the parking lot ramp.
(simultaneous) No problem. You bet.
Mouth-to-mouth?
We're practically to Monticello.
You are nothing but a piece of crap.
Ahhh! Yaaaahhh!
(smugly) That is seven dollars and twenty-two cents better.
I *loathe* you.
Come on, let me try it on.
Kramer, what the hell are you doing?
Ohhh!
So I sped home to save my friend's life and I was stopped for speeding. Yes, I admit I was speeding but it was to save a man's life. A close friend. An innocent person who wanted nothing more out of life than to love, to be loved and to be a banker.
Yeah, but you pulled him in.
(Writing on a clipboard) Rusty.
(taking bottle) Refund?
(eating) hm.
Well, ELAINE, There's any number of things I could do. But, I can promise you this, though, this vicious beast will never bother you again. So, what's it going to be?
A second later, something happened that changed us in a deep and profound way front that day forward.
Huh.
What you need me in the car for?
So , you have fleas. Maybe you keep your house in a state of disrepair. Maybe you live in squalor.
Jerry, you better stop her or Ill tell.
Alright.
(moving away from the counter getting closer to the door) Hello Jerry.
Alright, alright, back, savages. Back! I haven't made my wish yet..
I can't. I'm goin' to a movie.
June 14, 1987.... Mets Phillies. We're enjoying a beautiful afternoon in the right field stands when a crucial Hernandez error to a five run Phillies ninth. Cost the Mets the game.
No, you can't tell it ..
Yeah, I couldn't be sorrier. I uh.
(Yelling out to Rusty) Alright, pace yourself, 'Cause you're gonna have to do this all day for very little money.
It was a cinch. Where are you going?
Well, there is a little something you can do for me...
Ahaha!
Cancel! (jumps to feet) Think again, longshanks! I started planning this in nineteen seventy-eight. I put a deposit down on that revolving restaurant that overlooks Times Square, and I booked Christopher Cross.
Come on, are you ready? Let's go!
(Realizing he won) Yeah.
Ah, yes. Forbidden love.
(peering at bottle label) What is this 'MI, ten cents'?
Hello. What 's this?
You've come at a bad time now. Could you come back later?
Tim Whatley.
Right. Kramer, you have to confront Jerry.
Pair of bear claws, please.
(excited) Ooh, my cocoa!
Hey, hey maybe I should go with him?
Deh!
You must be banker.
I'm a United States postal worker.
I guess there's not much action down there these days.
Not really.
What, do I have to spell it out for ya? He was moving on her like the storm-troopers into Poland.
(at the counter) Pair of bear claws please.
I wanted to, he won't let me.
Hey Kramer, those have wholesale value! We could cut our losses.
To prevent an ambush.
Will that take care of ours too?
What makes you think I'm lookin' for trouble?
That's right.
(couple quick breaths) Shocking.
(triumph) Let the collecting begin!
Me either.
It's Newman.
It's Thursday.
(From outside the room) Kramer? Kramer? (Enters Jerry's bedroom) There you are.
Oh no. Don't tell me. You're gambling again, aren't you? Oh you weak, weak man. Where are you?
But, on the week before holidays, we see a surge. On alentine's Day, we send two trucks. On Christmas, four, packed to the brim. And tomorrow, if history is any guide, will see some spillover into a fifth truck.
(pushing past Kramer) Kramer, help me! Help me!
Uncle Leo? This case is closed pending further evidence. Jerry.
(Strangling Kramer) What's the matter with you? We had it all worked out!
Wait a minute. You mean you get five cents here, and ten cents there. You could round up bottles here and run 'em out to Michigan for the difference.
It was disgusting.
I'm homeless! I'm gonna be out on a street corner, dancing for nickels. I'll be with the hobos in the trainyard, eating out of a bucket.
Okay.
Hello Jerry.
(Kissing the woman) Beauty .. and brains. (they nuzzle noses)
I shoulda gone in with him.
You heard me. So he packed it up and split for the coast. La-La Land. L.A.
(to Kramer) You wanna know why you can't go in front first? I'll tell you why. because it signals a breakdown in the social order. Chaos. It reduces us to jungle law.
And then you spit on us.
You know, old friend, sometimes I ponder this silly gulf between us and I say, "Why?" Are we really so different. For what is--
Not going to play ball. Huh all right. Admit it that stereo was all ready busted.
I know you know, but you don't know what I know.
All right. Then let me ask you this. Didn't you find it interesting that your friend had the foresight to purchase postal insurance for your stereo. Huh. I mean parcels are rarely damaged during shipping.
We gotta find that rickshaw. You check the sewers and dumpsters. I'll hit the soup kitchens, bakeries, and smorgasbords.
All right, all right. Go ahead, go ahead.
Hello, Jerry.
(laughing) Oh ho right. Well very nice seeing you folks and a by the way you didn't hear this from me. Tata (runs down the hallway laughing)
Hello, Jerry.
Well, it would take a hell of a lot. Because a friend is something you earn.
Well, ta-ta! (Scampers away.)
I can't sleep, I tell you! I can't sleep!
(after speeding truck) Kramer!!
Who is it.
Here.
It looks like your breaking into it like an otter breaking into a clad.
Oh, thank you, sir.
Well, there's very little sleeping going on.
Oh the theater. Because I was wondering.
He must have caught a glimpse of us when I poured that beer on his head.
Kramer?! Kramer!? Where are you? Kramer!?! Kramer!!?
I think he stealing our rickshaw!
(sings) You're once. Twice. Three times a lady.
I was speaking earlier with Kramer and he mentioned something about a private jet to Paris?
Clean? Hardly. This looks like a man that isn't happy with his stereo performance.
All right! All right. I wont say anything.
I'll meet you at the coffee shop.
I dont care much for the beach. I freckle. . . . Is that a,..
Can I have a bite?
(Talking to another man) ...yeah he worked in the cubicle right next to me. We once double dated.
Don't you have a-a boyfriend? A, uh, burly, athletic type?
What're you doing?
Okay. What is it?
(Sinister) All right, all right. All right you go ahead. You go ahead and keep it secret. But you remember this. When you control the mail, you control... information.
Well he really seemed to have his hands full if you know what I mean.
Now, you're that firend. Now, all we need is a reason why you were going to commit suicide.
(laughs - T-heheheheheheheh) El Paso!
I love.. broccoli, its, good for you.
Don't look at me.
I cant eat fruit. It makes me incontinent.
Okay, you're all set? You got your story?
(thinking to himself; checks a comb) No. (checks a brush) Jackpot. I don't believe this. There's no hair in this thing. I've never seen a person that didn't have at least one hair in a brush.
Then I turned and the spit ricochet of him and it hit me.
Bark.
(Stands up and Sputtering loudly) Kramer! I'm with people.
So, to what do I owe this unusual invitation?
Anything else?
I too am well.
Not that!
Yea, it's the wood that makes it good.
What kind of dog did you say it was?
What are you doing?
Sorry. Climbers, keepers.
Can I try it on?
I find you extremely ugly.
(interrogating Kramer) Mister Kramer, you heard the testimony so far. Would you please tell the court in your own words what happened on the afternoon of September 10th?
Hello Gina. Hello Jerry.
Banker! So you're killing yourself because your dreams of becoming a banker have gone unfulfilled. You-you-you-you can't live without being a banker.
Vile weed!
See'ya later.
Sorry , last one . Would you want to suck the pit?
Jerry, George. [To Kramer] So, did you ask him about the records?
Oh, can I watch a little? Cuz it's my favorite movie.
Oh, all the way up.
He's shipping us a rickshaw. It can't miss!
Yes thank you. (slams door)
Yes, I called you, you idiot! Because you were going to... You were going to... Remember?
Kramer!!
Kramer.
I know exactly how he feels. Pleasure doing business with you. Do come again. Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Oh, don't you? Joke boy? You really think you can manipulate that beautiful young woman like the half-soused nightclub rabble that lap up your inane "observations"?
What's the catch?
The reverse peepholes. Silvio said I'm an agitator and I'm out of the building.
Nice place you got here Kramer ...
Well, you'll never guess what happened to me today. I was uh, driving ( Jerry and Kramer turn away) home on the palisades parkway when I looked in the rear view mirror and what did I see? The fuzz. And it's funny because my new radar detector was on. I didn't hear a thing. Isn't that strange?
"Do not bend". (Laughs evilly) Just crease, crumple, cram.. you'll do fine. (Phone rings. Newman answers it) Hello?.. This is he. I don't understand.. very well. (Hangs up in disappointment)
Hello Jerry.
You know Ron's Records down on Bleeker? They pay big cash for used records!
Let's go. Let's go. Move!
I WANT MY HELMET BACK! GIVE ME BACK MY HELMET AND YOU'RE GOING TO PAY FOR THAT TICKET.
Can I have a sip?
(to Kramer) You shut up! (to judge) I demand a recess so I can take him outside and help him regain hius composure.
Hello Elaine. Where are they?
Make us!
Hey, you know this is kind of fun.
Hello, Jerry. Tim couldn't make it, he's in love. Isn't that wonderful?
I'm sorry I missed that.
He did it right in this bed, Martin. Right in front of you.
Well, I hear it's quite beautiful there this time of year, and of course you know I'm one-quarter French.
Aaah! Aaagh! Aah-aah. Oh, oh the humanity! Aaagh!
All right, all right.
Take me! Take me!
Hmm, that job sounds like it might be worth a year's free haircuts. And a comb.
(running out the door) Jerry! Jerry!
All my work, my planning, my genius. All for nought.
I have a carpet sweeper you can use.
Alright, go ahead and hit me, Seinfeld. I got witnesses.
I called in sick. I don't work in the rain.
I took over his route. And boy, were there a lot of dogs on that route.
Yes. It's called mail fraud. Oohhhh. How I've longed for this moment Seinfeld. The day when I would have the proof I needed to hall you out of your cushy lair and expose to the light of justice as the monster that you are. A monster so vile.....
Just one bite?
Well you're reneging.
Oh, that's real.
All right, I'm going to need a clean 8 ounce glass.
Your Honor, Mister Kramer's obviously very distraught.
Drop bye anytime, jerry. Hah, ha ha
Here. Hold this.
No, no. I love strong cider. (for the farmer's daughter's benefit) I'm a big, strong, cider guy.
How much longer you gonna be, I'm starving here.
Look, you said the one in the second courtyard. He was in the second courtyard.
Because the mail never stops. It just keeps coming and coming and coming, there's never a let-up. It's relentless. Every day it piles up more and more and more! And you gotta get it out but the more you get it out the more it keeps coming in. And then the bar code reader breaks and it's *Publisher's Clearing House* day!!!
Hey George, nice hat.
You gave me a defective detector. ... Jerry?
Waaaaahhhh!
I don't have that kinda dough.
No.
Sorry. But love is spice with many tastes. A dizzying array of textures...and moments.
All right, tell it.
Hey, don't listen to him. I mean, we can't afford a detour. Our budget won't hold it.
Don't say anything.
Yes, Yes, now please. Someone, honey mustard.
(to Kramer) That's where my missing soda is.
Help! Help!
What about a guest-host?
It's the truck, Kramer. The truck!
I can't think, there's all this noise.
Thanks buddy. So long he he ...(exits)
I despise him.
Not so fast, Elaine! Only the bike's true owner would rather give it away than see it come to harm. Kramer, the bike is yours!
Hello, Jerry. How's Pam?
My toilet's clogged.
(Intrigued) What are you proposing?
Yes, the banker!!!
You know I hear Mr. Steinbrenner can be a bit erratic. I would hate to see him when he's hungry.
Every night I sleep in a really hot room, I don't want to kill myself.
Hey, what is that up that tree?
No, but there's karma, Kramer.
One winsome tulip we ceaselessly yearn for throughout our dreary, workaday lives! And you, my friend, have found your angel. I can tell. For my heart has also been captured by a breathless beauty - whom I fear I will never possess.
No, that's a fur coat! Hey, uh, give me a boost.
(thoughtful) What kind?
(mouth full) It's delicious mutton. This is uh, this is outta sight. I would, I would love to get the recipe. It's very good.
I have a private matter to discuss with my fellow tenants. (Opens door) If you don't mind?
No, no, no. That's not gonna work. Something else.
I don't wanna.
And then, just as I'm about to go, these boxes show up at the post office with no labels. No labels, Jerry. You know what that means? Freebies!! I got this great mini-TV and a VCR, oh it's unbelievable.
Kramer!
Easy, Jerry. Steady. You wouldn't want to lose your cool at a time like this.
I was never that big on creeds.
Yeah, tell me about it.
Damn!
(from the corner of the Yogurt shop) Hey, Jerry. Thanks a lot. I hope you're happy.
Me too.
No. No.
Name, please.
Aaaaahhh...!!!
Do I smell Pantene?
Yes, from me!! I called you remember?
Boy, thats the full size.
Do we have a deal?
"Pam." I don't know the woman, but she sounds quite fetching.
You're telling how your parents pushed you into banking.
Hellooo Jerry. What a rare treat. What brings you down to the east wing?
(fleeing to the bedroom) Damn!
Yeah. From you.
I'm doing it for you.
I did invite you. Your invitation must've gotten ... lost in the mail.
Hilarious.
It'll be my pleasure.
Cool?
This isn't about my opening your mail?
A banker! A banker! Your Honor, Your Honor, Your Honor...
Look, sister, go get yourself a cup of coffee, all right? Beat it! (Pushes Elaine out the door and closes it) All right, now here's the lowdown. From a certain connection, I've been able to locate some black market shower heads. They're all made in the former Yugoslavia, and from what I hear the Serbs are fanatic about their showers.
(squeezing himself through the narrow space) Nothing, just being neighborly. Do you wanna hang out? Shoot the breeze?
No, no I don't like it.
An alliance?
Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry.
I hope you know what you're doing... (Kramer gives Newman a look of lack of confidence)
Hey, hey...
Do you really want to know what happened? I'll tell you what Happened. She wasn't my type.
Jerry? I'm a little insulted.
I don't know. The man makes a pretty strong bird.
Aahh! You're great,It's great, It's so great to see a show that's (looks at Jerry) about something.
I'm leavin'. Jerry's a nut. (Exits)
Well, you've both presented very convincing arguments. On the one hand, Elaine, your promise was given in haste. But was it not still a promise? Hmm?
Hello Jerry.
If we put our three heads together we should come up with something.
Alright, who's first?
(Cannot take this torture anymore) Baaaaaaaaarrhhhhhhhhhhh....I'm ripped with fleas ( scratches furiously)
Where? I..I..I don't see it.
Of course. Take your time. I be here.
As you were saying, Mister Kramer...
But Jerry, we've got this new supervisor down at the post office. He's working behind this glass. I know they're talking about me. They're going to transfer me, I know it. Two hours, give me two hours.
Wallet.
Quite frankly, I don't see how it's any of your business.
Kind of. I'm still collecting checks, I'm just not delivering mail.
What's the matter with you? I just talked to you fifteen minutes ago.
Federal employee. Federal employee.
Great streak of luck I'm having. First, Kramer almost beat me at Risk but I narrowly escaped, and then Tim Whatley gives me his Super Bowl ticket.
(excited) We carry a coupla bags of mail, and the rest is ours!
Because I don't, never have, anything I read was already open.
Just to tell me to keep off the snacks!
You?! (Laughs hysterically) You can't deliver mail!
I don't like it.
(Eyes glued to the TV) I guess.
Shell.
(dancing) Can I use your bathroom?
[panting] Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!
I don't know, they're deranged.
It was because you hated your father and you would do anything to displease him. Isn't THAT true?
Well, I wouldn't hear of it. I said, "Nice try, granny!" And I sent her to the back of the line!
Pantene!
(Stands up) Too many people go their mail! Close to 80%. No body from the post office has ever cracked the 50% barrier! It's like the 3-minute mile!
Reversed?! (Kramer comes hobbling out of the doctors office in pain, after having a vasectomy of his own, and exits. Jerry and Newman look at each other, and bolt for the door themselves.)
So we could put the bottles in a U-haul. You know, go lean and mean?
Okay, here it is.
Come on lets go. I got the helmet. Lets get the radar detector.
(sobbing) I can't afford that!
Maybe we could uh, stop for a snack.
No! That's no reason to kill yourself!
Oh yes, in fact I still have family there. This probably won't interest you, but I have a cousin there who's suffering very badly. She's lost all use of her muscles. She can only communicate by blinking. I would so love to see her - bring a ray of sunshine into her tragic life. But alas, I can't afford it, for I am, as you know, but a simple postal worker.
Once I find a barber I stick with him. I almost went to barber school. I always felt I had a talent for it.
You are?
