Now, what we are going to dissect today is the West Indian manatee.  Manatees are mammals that live in the oceans and are often called the gentle clowns of the sea.

I've already gone through that with the girls.  It's pretty simple. Do you wanna drink?

You can only use it in the non-literal sense. For instance,  "That's a shitty picture of me." is now fine. Hoever, the literal noun form of  "This is a picture of shit." is still naughty. 

Alright class, as some of you may have heard, the President has asked that American children all send one dollar to the children of Afghanistan.  So I have a list of addresses and we're goin' to all chip in.

Oh my God. Oh God, yeah! Stop! Stop!

This is the fourth grade! You need to grow up! 

He's right. I never knew how special and personal sex was un... until just recently.

All right, children, before we get started, has anybody seen the eraser for the chalkboard?  It probably got knocked on the floor somewhere. Can you all just please look around your desks for it? 

Alright, children, as I'm sure you all remember, today we are going to continue our biology lesson... dissecting an organism.

Most of them are very nice. But, apparently, one of you thinks it's fun to spoil their school pictures , and thinks he's a comedian. That person will be spending the afternoon in the principal's office!

Alright, class, let's take our seats.  Now, uh, before we get started, Stan and Kyle? Uh, the principal needs to see you in her office.

The one in the wheelchair! Look, I would like to have a talk with their last year's teacher! Who was it? Mr. Uh-heh, Garrison?! 

Okay children, step off the bus and form a group next to the nice redneck - I mean, rancher.

"Don't use that kind of language, young man!"

Okay. Whose project should we look at next? How aboouuut Eric?  Eric Cartman?

You know very well my name isn't Chokesonrocks, it's Choksondik! Say it right or you can go to the principal's with Butters!

Alright, children, I hope you all did your-  Oowhat is going on now?! 

Now, let us begin our first-day exam.  SILENCE!

And now we will be removing the spleen. Notice how the manatee's spleen is designed for a qu-

Oh well, fuck it  Oh God, give it to me! 

I'm sorry, Kyle. You'll just have to make do.  Now let's get back to the le-

It looks fine, Butters.  Okay, hold on and stay here, children. 

Alright, children, I hope you all did your homework last night. Please pass your papers up to the frontuh.

Oh, hold on.  Now, children, our first incision will be along the abdomen.

Alright, children, now, let's get back in our seats. Uh, we are now going to put the manatees back together. 

You said, "suck my balls." Well, go ahead. Whip 'em out, and I'll suck 'em.

But I need help reaching these kids! I have nothing but the highest expectations for them. And with  God as my witness-

My new students are the most misbehaved, illiterate, brain-dead group of children I have ever come across!

Oh, it's no problem, Mr. Mackey. It's probably best we come up with a lesson plan together anyway.

I'm afraid this is all my fault. I... think I went a little overboard scaring the girls. I forgot to tell them that to get diseases from boys you... have to have sex with them first.

I knew it! Well, at least we scared them enough to protect themselves. But now maybe you'll believe me when I say that we need to be teaching even younger than fourth grade.

Well we should make sure our students are good and scared of the consequences. We have to teach them that diseases are possible even with just oral sex.

No? Oh, oh well. Never mind. I've got a backup one in the desk.  Okay, today children, we're gonna learn about multiplying times five.

Alright, students, that will be quite enough! If you're ready, let's continue on... with the fourth grade. 

These children are out of control! I must speak with their last year's teacher, Mr. Garrison! 

They sure are, Wendy, and that's why we must learn what's inside them.  Now, we don't have quite enough  manatees to go around, so I think we're gonna have to split up into groups of four. 

Wait wait wait! Do you have a condom?

Now, get back to your desk and write a thousand-word essay on why you feel you need to disrupt my class.

It's Choksondik! And you are all going to have detention!

You just put that thing together just now! I'm giving you a check minus.

Hello-oo-ooo.  Oh, what am I doing? I'm gonna get myself killed.  Is anyone here?  Mister? Mr. Garrison?

Mr. Garrison, you knew how to reach these kids! You're my only hope!

"Children, we are now going to do math problems."

Something about how nerve endings play an important part in intercourse. 

Alright, class, I have your school photos to hand out-

Well, well, well! I'd say somebody has some explaining to do!

Next in line! Come on, let's keep it moving, kids! 

I am the new fourth grade teacher. I've come to... seek your help.  Please. I don't know how to handle the new fourth graders. I've tried everything. I need to know how you taught them.

Yes, but only in the figurative noun form or the adjective form

Alright girls. Yesterday we went over the myriad of diseases you can get from boys, but today we're going to talk about the most horrible they can give you of all.  PREGNANCY!  That's right, since you girls have decided to be sexually active, teen pregnancy is at an all-time high! You seem to think it's gonna be fun and neat to have a baby-well, let's watch a little video, shall we?! 

For the rest of you, I think your pictures turned out very nicely.

Well, I'm quite happy without sex. I mean, with all the diseases and problems out there, who needs it, right?

Why, yes. The nerve endings are the most concentrated at- the- tip of the penis. Like they are in the...  clitoris of the woman.

We've got to get to the students before they start having... sex. Nu-not after.

Now let's get on with our lesson on the-

Your mother is waiting for you in the principal's office. 

Using your mouth on the penis or vagina.

Very very good, Token. You get a check plus.

I see.  Then the only way I'll find the secret to teaching these kids is to go up into those mountains and find Mr. Garrison myself!

Now, children, listen to me. Why do you want to go back in time? Life isn't about going back, it's about going forward. Yes, there are times in our life that we wish we could relive, but, if we already lived them perfectly, why live them again? The adventure of life is that there's always something new. New challenges, new experiences. A fun game is a game that gets harder as it goes. So it is with life. Do you understand?

The heads of the Earth Day Brainwashing organization are here to tell you all about it. 

Well, I think people are just fed up with the crowded shopping and the credit-card bills, uh.  I, I think that the holiday just has become a joke.

It's just too bad these girls are having sex so young.

Well, if you must know, I'm still somewhat of a virgin.  But I'm not ashamed of it! I wasn't sought after much in high school or college.  I was made fun of most of my life for having such large glasses.  The only boyfriend I ever had was this attractive popular boy named Steven Garrett. I liked him very much, but I... found out that he was dating me because he lost a bet on the Super Bowl. The loser had to go out with me for three days.

"Uuh! Ah, you will do them or else you'll be in very big trouble!"

I'm going to teach these kids the wonders of the world, so that they can reach the top!  I hope that sometime very soon you will let me in on what happened to this Mr. Garrison! And with that I will bid you good day!

Oh, I'll find him! Even if I have to climb up  and up  and up!

Yes, unfortunately the school seems to be completely out of extra desks. So you'll just have to share with your cousin.

I said, pass your papers to the fronteh!

Eric, calm down. I'm trying to yell at Butters!

Oh, alrighty.  What the? Why there's nothing in here but an exit to the other side!  There's nothing in here at all. ...Oh, and I actually thought my mental demons would be in here.  Wait a minute. Maybe there's not supposed to be anything in here. Maybe I'm supposed to see that I alone do have the strength to reach the kids!  I think I get it now! 

Today over 20,000 Americans will contract a sexual disease! TODAY! Twelve thousand more tomorrow! And the reason is that you girls wake up in the morning and say, "It's not going to happen to me." You say, "Oh, Ms. Choksondik, that happens to girls in Detroit, in Brooklyn, but not here in Colorado." WRONG!  Gonorrhea, herpes, chlamydia, HPV, HIV, syphilis, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, the list goes on and on! These are serious diseases! They have serious consequences!  You think that sex is about fun and games and love?  Wrong! Sex is about disease! Here's a little picture of herpes.

I'm sorry, boys, but nothing's more important than Earth Day.

That's right, girls. Here's what happens when you don't get boys to use condoms!

Alright, children, we are all sending a dollar to the kids in Afghanistan! That's it! End of discussion!

Now Kyle, I need you to be quiet. In my class you need to be able to concentrate.

Play time is over, children! Do you understand me?!  I don't know how your last teacher behaved, but this is the fourth grade!  And it is time to go to work!

One of them is mentally handicapped, for Christ's sake!

Alright girls, even though this may be stuff you don't want to hear, you need to hear it.

Alright, children, let's settle down. As you know, this coming Friday is Earth Day.  and I'm pleased to announce that the national Earth Day organization has chosen South Park as its location for the Earth Day Brainwashing Festival.

People can be very cruel. Anyway, I know it's hard to understand.

Yeah? What do you do when you think about me?

Hey! That kid took my last eraser!  Come back here, kid! 

Alright, children, in lieu of the common usage, I'm s'posed to clarify the school's position on the word, "shit".

Well, young man, I hope you have a good explanation for this.

Now, whenever we multiply a number times five, the result is going to end in a zero or a five.

Wow, I've... never met a man who is... as sexually unappealing as me.

The adjective form is now also acceptable. For example:  "The weather outside is shitty." However, the literal adjective is not appropriate. For example:  "My bad diarrhea made the inside of the toilet bowl shitty, and I had to clean it with a rag, which then also became shitty."  That's right out!

Naive at what cost, Chef? Parents, we have to face facts: Children in America are having sex at younger and younger ages. STDs are affecting younger and younger kids all the time. The only way we can combat that is by educating children before they have sex.

Just go, Butters.  Okay, so for instance, five times one is... what, Eric?

Fun! It's going to be fun! Well let's start with our first lesson, then, shall we?  SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES!!  That's right, because unless you get boys to wear condoms you can and will get a sexually transmitted disease from them! How fun is that, hmmm?! Is that fun?
