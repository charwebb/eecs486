Butters, did you see another little kid run out of here?
Using your mouth on the penis or vagina.
All right, children, before we get started, has anybody seen the eraser for the chalkboard?  It probably got knocked on the floor somewhere. Can you all just please look around your desks for it? 
It looks fine, Butters.  Okay, hold on and stay here, children. 
Alright, students, that will be quite enough! If you're ready, let's continue on... with the fourth grade. 
Oh, I'll find him! Even if I have to climb up  and up  and up!
Oh alright Butters. Take the bathroom pass and go.  Okay, so for instance, children-
Today over 20,000 Americans will contract a sexual disease! TODAY! Twelve thousand more tomorrow! And the reason is that you girls wake up in the morning and say, "It's not going to happen to me." You say, "Oh, Ms. Choksondik, that happens to girls in Detroit, in Brooklyn, but not here in Colorado." WRONG!  Gonorrhea, herpes, chlamydia, HPV, HIV, syphilis, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, the list goes on and on! These are serious diseases! They have serious consequences!  You think that sex is about fun and games and love?  Wrong! Sex is about disease! Here's a little picture of herpes.
Next in line! Come on, let's keep it moving, kids! 
Something about how nerve endings play an important part in intercourse. 
"Don't use that kind of language, young man!"
We got so caught up in the little things of Christmas, like love and family that... we almost forgot it's buying things that makes our economy thrive.
Just go, Butters.  Okay, so for instance, five times one is... what, Eric?
Oh, it's no problem, Mr. Mackey. It's probably best we come up with a lesson plan together anyway.
Why, yes. The nerve endings are the most concentrated at- the- tip of the penis. Like they are in the...  clitoris of the woman.
I've already gone through that with the girls.  It's pretty simple. Do you wanna drink?
I knew it! Well, at least we scared them enough to protect themselves. But now maybe you'll believe me when I say that we need to be teaching even younger than fourth grade.
"Children, we are now going to do math problems."
Now, what we are going to dissect today is the West Indian manatee.  Manatees are mammals that live in the oceans and are often called the gentle clowns of the sea.
Your mother is waiting for you in the principal's office. 
I am the new fourth grade teacher. I've come to... seek your help.  Please. I don't know how to handle the new fourth graders. I've tried everything. I need to know how you taught them.
Oh my God. Oh God, yeah! Stop! Stop!
Concentration is the key to succeeding in my class.
"Uuh! Ah, you will do them or else you'll be in very big trouble!"
Okay children, step off the bus and form a group next to the nice redneck - I mean, rancher.
I'm afraid this is all my fault. I... think I went a little overboard scaring the girls. I forgot to tell them that to get diseases from boys you... have to have sex with them first.
Alright, class, I have your school photos to hand out-
Oh, alrighty.  What the? Why there's nothing in here but an exit to the other side!  There's nothing in here at all. ...Oh, and I actually thought my mental demons would be in here.  Wait a minute. Maybe there's not supposed to be anything in here. Maybe I'm supposed to see that I alone do have the strength to reach the kids!  I think I get it now! 
He's right. I never knew how special and personal sex was un... until just recently.
Mr. Garrison, you knew how to reach these kids! You're my only hope!
Well, I think people are just fed up with the crowded shopping and the credit-card bills, uh.  I, I think that the holiday just has become a joke.
Well, if you must know, I'm still somewhat of a virgin.  But I'm not ashamed of it! I wasn't sought after much in high school or college.  I was made fun of most of my life for having such large glasses.  The only boyfriend I ever had was this attractive popular boy named Steven Garrett. I liked him very much, but I... found out that he was dating me because he lost a bet on the Super Bowl. The loser had to go out with me for three days.
Yes, but only in the figurative noun form or the adjective form
Naive at what cost, Chef? Parents, we have to face facts: Children in America are having sex at younger and younger ages. STDs are affecting younger and younger kids all the time. The only way we can combat that is by educating children before they have sex.
Hey! That kid took my last eraser!  Come back here, kid! 
I see.  Then the only way I'll find the secret to teaching these kids is to go up into those mountains and find Mr. Garrison myself!
These children are out of control! I must speak with their last year's teacher, Mr. Garrison! 
Alright, continue with the removal of the spleen, children. I'll be right back. 
That's right, girls. Here's what happens when you don't get boys to use condoms!
Very very good, Token. You get a check plus.
I'm going to teach these kids the wonders of the world, so that they can reach the top!  I hope that sometime very soon you will let me in on what happened to this Mr. Garrison! And with that I will bid you good day!
This is the fourth grade! You need to grow up! 
The adjective form is now also acceptable. For example:  "The weather outside is shitty." However, the literal adjective is not appropriate. For example:  "My bad diarrhea made the inside of the toilet bowl shitty, and I had to clean it with a rag, which then also became shitty."  That's right out!
Alright girls, even though this may be stuff you don't want to hear, you need to hear it.
Wow, I've... never met a man who is... as sexually unappealing as me.
Fun! It's going to be fun! Well let's start with our first lesson, then, shall we?  SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES!!  That's right, because unless you get boys to wear condoms you can and will get a sexually transmitted disease from them! How fun is that, hmmm?! Is that fun?
Now let's get on with our lesson on the-
Now, children, listen to me. Why do you want to go back in time? Life isn't about going back, it's about going forward. Yes, there are times in our life that we wish we could relive, but, if we already lived them perfectly, why live them again? The adventure of life is that there's always something new. New challenges, new experiences. A fun game is a game that gets harder as it goes. So it is with life. Do you understand?
Eric, calm down. I'm trying to yell at Butters!
Oh, hold on.  Now, children, our first incision will be along the abdomen.
Most of them are very nice. But, apparently, one of you thinks it's fun to spoil their school pictures , and thinks he's a comedian. That person will be spending the afternoon in the principal's office!
Now, let us begin our first-day exam.  SILENCE!
My new students are the most misbehaved, illiterate, brain-dead group of children I have ever come across!
Alright, children, we are all sending a dollar to the kids in Afghanistan! That's it! End of discussion!
Well, I'm quite happy without sex. I mean, with all the diseases and problems out there, who needs it, right?
Okay, good job, Butters. You get a check.
You just put that thing together just now! I'm giving you a check minus.
Alright girls. Yesterday we went over the myriad of diseases you can get from boys, but today we're going to talk about the most horrible they can give you of all.  PREGNANCY!  That's right, since you girls have decided to be sexually active, teen pregnancy is at an all-time high! You seem to think it's gonna be fun and neat to have a baby-well, let's watch a little video, shall we?! 
Yeah? What do you do when you think about me?
For the rest of you, I think your pictures turned out very nicely.
The one in the wheelchair! Look, I would like to have a talk with their last year's teacher! Who was it? Mr. Uh-heh, Garrison?! 
The heads of the Earth Day Brainwashing organization are here to tell you all about it. 
Yes, unfortunately the school seems to be completely out of extra desks. So you'll just have to share with your cousin.
Well, well, well! I'd say somebody has some explaining to do!
People can be very cruel. Anyway, I know it's hard to understand.
Oh well, fuck it  Oh God, give it to me! 
Alright, children, I hope you all did your homework last night. Please pass your papers up to the frontuh.
It's just too bad these girls are having sex so young.
Alright, children, as I'm sure you all remember, today we are going to continue our biology lesson... dissecting an organism.
Now, get back to your desk and write a thousand-word essay on why you feel you need to disrupt my class.
Well we should make sure our students are good and scared of the consequences. We have to teach them that diseases are possible even with just oral sex.
Now, whenever we multiply a number times five, the result is going to end in a zero or a five.
Wait wait wait! Do you have a condom?
Alright, children, I hope you all did your-  Oowhat is going on now?! 
You know very well my name isn't Chokesonrocks, it's Choksondik! Say it right or you can go to the principal's with Butters!
Hello-oo-ooo.  Oh, what am I doing? I'm gonna get myself killed.  Is anyone here?  Mister? Mr. Garrison?
They sure are, Wendy, and that's why we must learn what's inside them.  Now, we don't have quite enough  manatees to go around, so I think we're gonna have to split up into groups of four. 
Well, young man, I hope you have a good explanation for this.
Now Kyle, I need you to be quiet. In my class you need to be able to concentrate.
Okay. Whose project should we look at next? How aboouuut Eric?  Eric Cartman?
And I know you'll all be very nice to our new student.  Kyle, why don't you tell us a little about yourself?
You can only use it in the non-literal sense. For instance,  "That's a shitty picture of me." is now fine. Hoever, the literal noun form of  "This is a picture of shit." is still naughty. 
I said, pass your papers to the fronteh!
It's Choksondik! And you are all going to have detention!
I'm sorry, boys, but nothing's more important than Earth Day.
Alright, children, in lieu of the common usage, I'm s'posed to clarify the school's position on the word, "shit".
School photos aren't for joking around, so you aren't getting your photo back, Butters! 
Alright, class, let's take our seats.  Now, uh, before we get started, Stan and Kyle? Uh, the principal needs to see you in her office.
Alright, children, now, let's get back in our seats. Uh, we are now going to put the manatees back together. 
Play time is over, children! Do you understand me?!  I don't know how your last teacher behaved, but this is the fourth grade!  And it is time to go to work!
Mr. Garrison, these children are depending on me to give them a future. I can't do it without your guidance. Please! Help me, for them! For the future of our children!
