Oh, alrighty.  What the? Why there's nothing in here but an exit to the other side!  There's nothing in here at all. ...Oh, and I actually thought my mental demons would be in here.  Wait a minute. Maybe there's not supposed to be anything in here. Maybe I'm supposed to see that I alone do have the strength to reach the kids!  I think I get it now! 

Tell me.

Alright, students, that will be quite enough! If you're ready, let's continue on... with the fourth grade. 

But I need help reaching these kids! I have nothing but the highest expectations for them. And with  God as my witness-

For the rest of you, I think your pictures turned out very nicely.

Eric, for the love of God. 

I HAVE HAD IT!!!

Boys, watch your language! Shit!

Hello-oo-ooo.  Oh, what am I doing? I'm gonna get myself killed.  Is anyone here?  Mister? Mr. Garrison?

Concentration is the key to succeeding in my class.

What?

These children are out of control! I must speak with their last year's teacher, Mr. Garrison! 

Oh.

This is the fourth grade! You need to grow up! 

Something about how nerve endings play an important part in intercourse. 

Children, I will have order!!

Okay. Whose project should we look at next? How aboouuut Eric?  Eric Cartman?

Alright, class, let's take our seats.  Now, uh, before we get started, Stan and Kyle? Uh, the principal needs to see you in her office.

One of them is mentally handicapped, for Christ's sake!

What lives inside?

The heads of the Earth Day Brainwashing organization are here to tell you all about it. 

Children! Children, come back here!

It looks fine, Butters.  Okay, hold on and stay here, children. 

...Kindergarten.

It's Choksondik! And you are all going to have detention!

Oh well, fuck it  Oh God, give it to me! 

Oh, it's no problem, Mr. Mackey. It's probably best we come up with a lesson plan together anyway.

And here's a little syphilis for you!

Oh Good Gravy, not this again.

Do you touch yourself?

Oh dear.

Did I what?

The adjective form is now also acceptable. For example:  "The weather outside is shitty." However, the literal adjective is not appropriate. For example:  "My bad diarrhea made the inside of the toilet bowl shitty, and I had to clean it with a rag, which then also became shitty."  That's right out!

I've already gone through that with the girls.  It's pretty simple. Do you wanna drink?

I see.  Then the only way I'll find the secret to teaching these kids is to go up into those mountains and find Mr. Garrison myself!

Children, get back into your seats!

Did you feel something?

Okay children, step off the bus and form a group next to the nice redneck - I mean, rancher.

Eric, the Afghan people need our help!

You said, "suck my balls." Well, go ahead. Whip 'em out, and I'll suck 'em.

Or the... shaft... of the penis? 

Well, young man, I hope you have a good explanation for this.

Yes, that's now fine.

Today over 20,000 Americans will contract a sexual disease! TODAY! Twelve thousand more tomorrow! And the reason is that you girls wake up in the morning and say, "It's not going to happen to me." You say, "Oh, Ms. Choksondik, that happens to girls in Detroit, in Brooklyn, but not here in Colorado." WRONG!  Gonorrhea, herpes, chlamydia, HPV, HIV, syphilis, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, the list goes on and on! These are serious diseases! They have serious consequences!  You think that sex is about fun and games and love?  Wrong! Sex is about disease! Here's a little picture of herpes.

Alright, children, we are all sending a dollar to the kids in Afghanistan! That's it! End of discussion!

I'm ready. I'm not afraid.

Woh.  Ooh, that's it baby! That's it!

"Don't use that kind of language, young man!"

Now Kyle, I need you to be quiet. In my class you need to be able to concentrate.

Who are you?

Alright girls, even though this may be stuff you don't want to hear, you need to hear it.

The one in the wheelchair! Look, I would like to have a talk with their last year's teacher! Who was it? Mr. Uh-heh, Garrison?! 

Next in line! Come on, let's keep it moving, kids! 

...Done.

Present them. 

Alright, children, I hope you all did your homework last night. Please pass your papers up to the frontuh.

Girls! Girls! Where are you going?! 

Play time is over, children! Do you understand me?!  I don't know how your last teacher behaved, but this is the fourth grade!  And it is time to go to work!

Principal Victoria, I would like a word! 

All right, children, before we get started, has anybody seen the eraser for the chalkboard?  It probably got knocked on the floor somewhere. Can you all just please look around your desks for it? 

Okay, why don't you go ahead and take a seat, Kyle? 

Very very good, Token. You get a check plus.

Eric, I mean it!

That's right, girls. Here's what happens when you don't get boys to use condoms!

Do you want me?

Just go, Butters.  Okay, so for instance, five times one is... what, Eric?

Naive at what cost, Chef? Parents, we have to face facts: Children in America are having sex at younger and younger ages. STDs are affecting younger and younger kids all the time. The only way we can combat that is by educating children before they have sex.

Yeah? What do you do when you think about me?

Alright, children, now, let's get back in our seats. Uh, we are now going to put the manatees back together. 

Alright class, as some of you may have heard, the President has asked that American children all send one dollar to the children of Afghanistan.  So I have a list of addresses and we're goin' to all chip in.

School photos aren't for joking around, so you aren't getting your photo back, Butters! 

I'm afraid this is all my fault. I... think I went a little overboard scaring the girls. I forgot to tell them that to get diseases from boys you... have to have sex with them first.

And I know you'll all be very nice to our new student.  Kyle, why don't you tell us a little about yourself?

Hey! That kid took my last eraser!  Come back here, kid! 

Okay, good job, Butters. You get a check.

She needs to see you now! 

They sure are, Wendy, and that's why we must learn what's inside them.  Now, we don't have quite enough  manatees to go around, so I think we're gonna have to split up into groups of four. 

Wow, I've... never met a man who is... as sexually unappealing as me.

Why?! Where did he go?!

Now let's get on with our lesson on the-

Mr. Garrison, you knew how to reach these kids! You're my only hope!

No??

"Children, we are now going to do math problems."

Oh, hold on.  Now, children, our first incision will be along the abdomen.

Your mother is waiting for you in the principal's office. 

He's right. I never knew how special and personal sex was un... until just recently.

Mr. Garrison, these children are depending on me to give them a future. I can't do it without your guidance. Please! Help me, for them! For the future of our children!

What in God's name happened to him?

Okay.  "Oral Sex"

NOW Eric!

I am the new fourth grade teacher. I've come to... seek your help.  Please. I don't know how to handle the new fourth graders. I've tried everything. I need to know how you taught them.

Butters, did you see another little kid run out of here?

It's just too bad these girls are having sex so young.

Well, well, well! I'd say somebody has some explaining to do!

Alright, children, in lieu of the common usage, I'm s'posed to clarify the school's position on the word, "shit".

Siddown. 

Now, get back to your desk and write a thousand-word essay on why you feel you need to disrupt my class.

And now we will be removing the spleen. Notice how the manatee's spleen is designed for a qu-

Yes, but only in the figurative noun form or the adjective form

Alright, Token, you're next. 

Well, back to the lesson plan, then.

Your nickname?

Pre-sent them?

Sit down, boys.

Kyle, we're taking pictures without hats today!

Using your mouth on the penis or vagina.

Alright, children, I hope you all did your-  Oowhat is going on now?! 

We've got to get to the students before they start having... sex. Nu-not after.

Now, what we are going to dissect today is the West Indian manatee.  Manatees are mammals that live in the oceans and are often called the gentle clowns of the sea.

We got so caught up in the little things of Christmas, like love and family that... we almost forgot it's buying things that makes our economy thrive.

Wait wait wait! Do you have a condom?

Very good, Timmy.

Alright, children, let's settle down. As you know, this coming Friday is Earth Day.  and I'm pleased to announce that the national Earth Day organization has chosen South Park as its location for the Earth Day Brainwashing Festival.

Fun! It's going to be fun! Well let's start with our first lesson, then, shall we?  SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES!!  That's right, because unless you get boys to wear condoms you can and will get a sexually transmitted disease from them! How fun is that, hmmm?! Is that fun?

What are you doing?!

It's your turn. 

Five... times...  one.

Choksondik.

Oh my God. Oh God, yeah! Stop! Stop!

Sexual stimulation.  Oh, is this wrong?

I said, pass your papers to the fronteh!

Now, let us begin our first-day exam.  SILENCE!

Oh, I'll find him! Even if I have to climb up  and up  and up!

People can be very cruel. Anyway, I know it's hard to understand.

Well, if you must know, I'm still somewhat of a virgin.  But I'm not ashamed of it! I wasn't sought after much in high school or college.  I was made fun of most of my life for having such large glasses.  The only boyfriend I ever had was this attractive popular boy named Steven Garrett. I liked him very much, but I... found out that he was dating me because he lost a bet on the Super Bowl. The loser had to go out with me for three days.

I'm sorry, boys, but nothing's more important than Earth Day.

Eric, calm down. I'm trying to yell at Butters!

Why, yes. The nerve endings are the most concentrated at- the- tip of the penis. Like they are in the...  clitoris of the woman.

I knew it! Well, at least we scared them enough to protect themselves. But now maybe you'll believe me when I say that we need to be teaching even younger than fourth grade.

Alright, continue with the removal of the spleen, children. I'll be right back. 

My new students are the most misbehaved, illiterate, brain-dead group of children I have ever come across!

Now, children, listen to me. Why do you want to go back in time? Life isn't about going back, it's about going forward. Yes, there are times in our life that we wish we could relive, but, if we already lived them perfectly, why live them again? The adventure of life is that there's always something new. New challenges, new experiences. A fun game is a game that gets harder as it goes. So it is with life. Do you understand?

What is it, Butters?

...Right.

What did you say?!

Now, whenever we multiply a number times five, the result is going to end in a zero or a five.

Most of them are very nice. But, apparently, one of you thinks it's fun to spoil their school pictures , and thinks he's a comedian. That person will be spending the afternoon in the principal's office!

"Uuh! Ah, you will do them or else you'll be in very big trouble!"

And, nobody has found him?

I'm going to teach these kids the wonders of the world, so that they can reach the top!  I hope that sometime very soon you will let me in on what happened to this Mr. Garrison! And with that I will bid you good day!
