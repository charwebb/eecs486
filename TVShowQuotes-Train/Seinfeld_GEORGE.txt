Hey, so get this. I get a call this morning from one of the Mets front office guys. They wanna take me out to lunch.
So you're gonna let me get suspended for shower urination?
Very exciting, very exciting, it's like watching a birth.
But I have to have them by one o'clock. He's very regiment about his meals.
I can't have any parties while they're out of town. (he leaves to return the soaps)
I'll tell you something, if I'd own a company, my employees would love me. They'd have huge pictures of me up on the walls and in their home, like Lenin.
It's exciting, isn't it? She's gonna have a whole new face.
Because I kissed her in the meeting. Russell found out, he fired her over the phone. Finally, my stupidity pays off!
Yes! Yes, I'm the one! Hey! So, you know Jon Voight!
Let me tell you something about that tag. It's no 31, and uh...let's just leave it at that.
And, um, it was quite good. In fact, you even incorporated me into the show. I'm not actually a performer. Although, my parents felt I had talent..
I gave. I gave everything I could Mrs. Sokol. but nothing was good enough for her.
Daphne. I have to tell you something, this is very difficult...
(Takes a sip) Hey, it's not too bad..
Yes, a shame. That is exactly how I would put it. Now Mrs. Sweedler, with all due discretion and sensitivity, and taking in the whole scope of the situation, I just can't help but think that, the hospital is somehow responsible for compensating the other, still living 'victim' of horrendous, horrendous tragedy.
She knew I didnt have a job, she knew I lived at home. Didnt seem to bother her. I think I could have married this woman.
All right, All right, keep your towel on.
I'm just asking, all they have to do is say no.
Did you ever solve the riddle of the pie?
Ah, I guess I should go up and apologize.
I know. I know. That's what I do. That's what I do.
Das kaffes un salat e grand por favor.
(Not really wanting to embellish) ..I stopped by the house to drop the car off, and I went inside for a few minutes.. Nobody was there - they're supposed to be working. (Jerry and Elaine look at each other - enjoying the story) My mother had a Glamour magazine, I started leafing through it..
Uh, excuse me. Uh, pound of Arabian mocha java, please.
Im going to find out whats going on. All right?
I cant believe- (falls on his knees) WE ALREADY DISCUSSED THIS!
I watched "Beaches" on cable last night. (wings?)  Give me a break.
(on phone, as Jerry gestures beside him) No, Lindsay, it was not IN the garbage. It was above the garbage. Hovering. Like an angel. Of course I know your aunt bit it. I kissed her goodbye. Listen, can I tell you something else? In my family, we used to eat out of the garbage all the time. (Jerry makes a face) It was no big thing. That's right. Oh, okay. Buh-bye. (hangs up phone) I'm back in, she gave me a second chance.
These old guys, they're up at 4 a.m., by two thirty they're wiped. (animated) How did we get back onto you?!
My parents. It's their anniversary. I'm taking them out to dinner and a show tonight. You think we'll hit traffic?
Wha? Did you use those? These are guest soaps! (he grabs the soaps and begins examining them for damage)
Yeah. Never seen anyone so bored. I'm working like a dog here. Give me a moan. *Something*. I'd settle for a belch, for god's sake. All right, come on, let's have it.
Could you make it two-twenty-five that was his hi-game in bowling.
You're not really gonna go to California, are you?
Mr. Thomassoulo during times of great stress, people are capable of super human strength. Have you ever seen the Incredible Hulk, sir?
(removing his glasses) You know, Hawaii could be a little tricky right now, there's a lot of high pressure winds down there this time of year, there's a lot of debris constantly flying around. Wood, and uh, lava, pretty dangerous.
Mr. Pensky. I was just working on your file. I was transferring the contents of the file into this flexible accordion-style folder.
Elaine...let me just explain something to you. See, this is not just a weekend routine...I'm on the verge of make-up sex here. You know about make-up sex?
Krama. Open up! I--I know you're in there!
Alright, well you know what'cha gotta do, you gotta go through her purse. Y'know, the-the credit cards, driver's license...
Thank you for leaving me alone with him!
Not everybody knows what the crop circles are. (to the newsstand owner) Do you know what the crop circles are?
(On his way out) Heh, heh, heh. Thats what they want you to think.
Your friend is been accused of being a serial killer. I think that qualifies.
Stay back! (Runs out of the room, pushing Jerry out ahead of him)
You want me to find a poem about Susan? May she rest in peace?!
Oh oh oh, all right, fine, Jerry, you win. Take it, just take it!
(George, finger in the peanut butter jar) This is what I do.
(Thomassoulo helps George get up) Yeah, what the hell.
I dont know, what? Eight thousand. Its a Hyundai. Get out of here. I told you not to sell. Simons made money, Wilkinson cleaned up.
You know, I think I could have played with dolls if their were dolls in the house. It seems like fun to me. It doesn't seem like a gender thing. I think I would like to play with dolls. What's so terrible?
Alright, alright! We'll buy her a wheelchair! Wheelchairs, engagement presents.. IT NEVER ENDS!
You had to hop! You had to hop on the plane.
There was no meeting. (gets one of the folding chairs) But it was quite a meeting. You are looking at the next director of Mets scouting. The only thing is, I have to get fired from the Yankees first.
well I don't know if there's gonna be any place to eat up there
Ha Ho! (he turns and walks out the door)
He's a sports writer for the daily news. I find him very insightful...
Why is nice bad? What kind a of sick society we are living in, when nice is bad?
Parking in a handicap spot. Right in the middle of his United Volunteers meeting. When he got back, he chased after me with a baseball bat.
(laughs - hehe) Well, first, I'm brushing my teeth and this piece of apple-skin, that must have been lodged in there for days, comes loose.
George.. (She doesn't seem to recognize him) George Costanza.
Ah, a, You know what, maybe I'll just come ... umm, yummm (stammering)
It won't for a while. At least not until after the cast comes off.
And she'll still see it, you're not stopping her from seeing it.
This is not about them. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to exercise Jerry's gaskets.
I walked in, your lobby door is broken again.
(Sitting on the sofa) I'm on no sleep, bro.
Now, fellas, fellas.. easy. You wouldn't want to beat up on one of your own.
What are these? (Holds test tubes to his head like antennae) Take me to your leader.
(horrified) But that meeting starts in ten minutes!
I had to give it to the liquor store guy.
What was that line again? Something about finding your way in a shadow?
(Breathing deeply) That's very dirty. (Jerry nods) That's absolutely filthy.
You see. You see! Listen when is your next drawing class?
Does she walk around holding a pen she never seems to need?
(passes cane from right to left and back a few times) But, see here. Right. Wrong. Right. Wrong. Right. Right. Wrong--
I think I had some hard candy in there.
Yeah. I don't think they'll be able to tell.
All right. Well, we'll see what happens to you.
Jerry, I can't. It's like saying to Pavorotti, "Teach me to sing like you."
Yes well unfortunately you'll never get the chance to find out.
You should've seen her face. It was the exact same look my father gave me when I told him I wanted to be a ventriloquist.
No problem. There's no problem. She just owes me ten dollars, that's all.
Why don't we talk about it another time.
Chamberlind, you could hold his head in nthe toilet, he'd still give you half of Europe.
Oh, okay. (Starts to walk other way and then walks to their room and goes in)
Well, I was very comfortable! I've got my nuts here...
All right. (tearing his jacket off) Let me just say one thing there is no way that this is gonna happen. You hear me? No Way! Because if you think I'm going' to two Thanksgivings, you're out of your mind!!!
Hey. I've kept the same job for more than two years. It's not luck. Elaine, have you ever sent a racy photograph of yourself to anyone?
I'm the assistant to the travelling secretary. I'm going on the road trips with 'em! I'll be on the plane... I'm working in Yankee Stadium! This is a dream, I'm busting, Jerry, I'm busting!
Ten minutes! Here, here, (Fishes a box of Tic-Tacs out of his coat pocket and tosses them to her) Have some Tic-Tacs.
Ya, ya. I bumped into him on the bus. What did he have to say?
Oh, sure. (Holds the box out as Susan takes out a few letters)
'Cause believe me, I would only say this to you and maybe a psychiatrist, maybe. Well, her nose is a little big.
This could be in a museum some day! It's not safe with me! It should really be in a doormanned building.
These are the balloons? Big deal, all I see is Woody Woodpecker.
I'll pay you for your time....I just ..I just need some information . How much do you want? ten....fifteen? You have change for twenty?
Oh my God. I must be crazy. What have I done?
I have nothing to say to anybody. I'm so uninteresting. I think I'm out of conversation.
Uh huh. Uh huh! I think you spoke to your little friend Rachel, that's what I think.
How can I do this? How can I move back in with those people? Please, tell me. They're insane. You know that.
No no, this is a matter of principle. That would just be saying that anybody could just pull into any parking space any way they want. Well I'm making a stand here. I'm saying *no* to head first parking. I'm not putting up with that. We put up with too much crap in this city, we're not putting up with head first parking.
Men have been popping into my sexual fantasies. All of a sudden I'll be, in the middle.
I can't carry any changes in these pants, it falls out.
Well it's not my fault. Seinfeld can't drive. How hard is it to follow somebody?
They had a pastry cart you wouldn't believe.
I know it may sound shocking. But, I just can't stop myself from... wanting you.
Who do I like? I, like, uh, Art, Vandelay.
hey, you know what? I just remembered something. I had a dream about that guy last night. This is amazing.
George! She said George? She remembered my name. (loudly -- to a passing waitress and the rest of the restaurant) Diane DeConn remembered my name. She was the "it" girl!
(Defensively) He knows how to read. And he also knows finishing an entire book doesn't prove anything. And get this he's into architecture.
Thats why, you know, a shake is bad.
Ah ha, Ah ha. You would, wouldn't you?
No, not a racial thing, there really is a resemblance...
Alright, then. We've gotten to the bottom of that.
I was in the middle of a conversation.
No come on, let me, let me. I smashed your car, it cost you over two thousand dollars,
(Concerned) Why're you doing this, Jerry? Is it your career? Things will pick up.
Dwayne, my friend and I would like to exchange frames. Could you put his lenses in my frames and mine in his?
Well you know what happens with larvae hatch, they-they're everywhere.
I am in and out of my personnel file at work all the time.
Hey, Elaine. Maybe his girlfriend is Lois Loan.
(Laughs as they leave) It's working already! (Both exit)
The sea was angry that day my friends like an old man trying to send back soup in a deli!
Yeah, but nothing happens on the show. You see, it's just like life. You know, you eat, you go shopping, you read.. You eat, you read, You go shopping.
(doing the voice) Im slippery as an eel
Why did you give him my ticket for?
No! I'm not gonna do that! That's one step away from personal ads! And prostitutes! No! No, I am not going down that road! What does she look like?
(attacking Kramer) How could you give me a defective condom?!
Is there ever a good time to have your parents stay with you?
Oh I'm going baby! I'm going! (he leaves)
I'm going out with her tomorrow, she said she had some errands to run.
Yeah, yeah. Speaking of crazy, did you hear about Lloyd Braun?
No, no, no, no, Im It. I win.
(pauses to consider this then gives in) All right. (starts heading towards bedroom)
Hey pop, would you buzz off, I've got something cooking.
You mean just walk into the staff meeting on Monday morning like it never happened?
Almost. Couldn't get the girl go out with me the second time.
I cant do it. Ill, Ill keep her busy.
you said "step off"? wow, that is too much hey..huh hey (George turns the cap his wearing backwards like Tony) Tony, I huh, I just had this brainstorm for us. Can you guess what it is?
No, no that can happen. Ive, uh, Ive read about that in medical journals. Its a freak thing, but...
For 50 bucks? I'd put my face in the soup and blow.
You think she would care about the red dot?
[furious] Good. It's good to be accurate like that.
" That guy was amazing, he could dunk and he was my height...What was his name again?"
(really animated) Alright, alright. You see? This is why I hate writing with a large group. Everybody has their own little opinions, and it all gets homogenised, and you lose the whole edge of it. I'm going with jerk store! Jerk store is the line! Jerk store! Yess!
I think I may be in love with this woman.
Jerry! I did it! Haha! I beat Braun!
Don't you believe me? It's their fiftieth anniversary. You know this is gonna kill him. You're aware of that. Kill him. On the biggest night of his life...
Oh, no, Sir. Festivus is all too real. And.. I could prove it - if I had to.
Wait a minute, you were at a funeral, right?
Divorce is very difficult. Especially on a kid.
(urgent) Move a pinkie, if it's yes. Can you move a pinkie?
Ovaltine. Have you ever had this stuff? Why is it called Ovaltine?
We get to go to the opera together!
Yeah? Well, I had sex with your wife.
Well, you know, if I uh, wasn't engaged.
What, what happened? Where's, where's all the stuff?
Do you really think I'm wrong about this Wyck guy?
Well, I'm gonna go back there later and return it when there's different people working.. You want to catch a movie?
What kind of a sick impulse does that??
(examining reflection) I really think this looks pretty good.
Why even try anymore? There's no sense to it. I'm never gonna meet anybody, I should just accept it.
I should probably get going too. If I don't feed Pequita by seven, she goes all over everything.. take it easy.
Ohh yes, yes. Yes Jerry they were all over me. It was like Rocky 1, Hm. Diane came up to me, threw her arms around me
You told her? How could you tell her? I told you not to say anything.
S-s-somebody double parked, we couldn't help it. It might have been Saddam Hussein, we're not really sure. He eh, had a British accent though.
Well take a look. It might not even belong to her.
Yeah, just tell him to hurry it up.
Me too. I've been yelling at strangers on the street.
please please I don't want to die up here. please, stop moving that's all I'm asking.. Kramer!!
How could you be a doctor and not say "get outta here"? It should be part of the training at medical school "Cancer? Get outta here!" "Go home! What are you crazy? It's a little test. It's nothing. You're a real nut. You know that?" (Jerry gives him half of his sandwich to hopefully shut him up) I told you that God would never let me be successful. I never should've written that pilot. Now the show will be a big hit, we'll make millions of dollars, and I'll be dead. Dead Jerry. Because of this. (showing his lip)
(crafty) Not necessarily. Why don't you take back the couch you gave me?
They're not mocked and humiliated when they get to the other side.
Huh. You must think Im pretty stupid. (The mechanic shoots him a look as if he cleary does think hes stupid) That was no 5th Avenue bar. I can see the crumb right there in the corner of your lip! Now, that-that-that is a cookie - and we all know that Twix is the only candy bar with the cookie crunch.
I am not putting it in a garage, it's my space.
Well, if she was a criminal and you had to describe her to a police sketch artist...
(to Kramer) It's a funeral procession. . . . (to Elaine) And I got news for you. I show up with Ring Dings and Pepsi, I become the biggest hit of the party. People be coming up to me, "just between you and me I'm really excited about the Ring Dings and the Pepsi. What are we, Europeans with the Beaujolais and Chardonnay . . .
What did they put on this tuna? Tastes like a dill, I think it's a dill.
Oh ho! Class, huh? At Columbia? Let me tell you something, pal. I called the registrars office. I checked you out. They have no record of a Ray Thomas at that school! You liar!
Elaine, bald men, with no jobs, and no money, who live with their parents, don't approach strange women.
Phil, I loved those cigars! Incoming! (Flicks his card tward Phil)
(Walks off) I got a lot of thinking to do.
Aw right YES! GUM! Good enough I'll take it.
The network executive. You think she liked me?
It's not my fault! I wasn't going to do anything until you got her all juiced up with your story about having the affair with the matador!
I, ... am breaking up with, ... you.
Oh, that's the worst part of it. He looks just like me.
We're on the Grand Central, there's no traffic.
I was doing standup comedy in Kennebunkport Maine. ??? night club. The stage was on a cliff and the audience was throwing all the comics off.
(to Jerry) What do you mean by that?
I'm not paying for this. If you were going out with her, it'd be a different story.
Great! Great! I actually just had two meaningful intelligent conversations with Corbin Bernsen and George Wendt.
Lets not forget the radiator. The steam has been on here for ten years. No human can turn this off.
(he makes a sign to Jodi to wait and turns to Jerry) Jerry... This woman hates me so much. I'm starting to like her.
Wednesday? That's your personal business?! (stalks over to the counter) Skiing?! (angry) So let people suffer, while you're shushing all over a mountain?
(worked up) I can't have a cup of coffee with a person?! I'm not allowed to have coffee?!
All right. You understand now? It's not that complicated.
Every time we go out to eat the minute we we're done eating she's runnin to the bathroom.
I know. This was the only woman I never lied to. Well thats not entirely true.
I know what you were trying to do. Nobody does it better than me.
Yes. Well -- So, uh, sit on the same side at a booth, huh?
See, Steinbrenner is like the first guy in, at the crack of dawn. He sees my car, he figures I'm the first guy in
All right, let me ask you something When do you start to worry about ear hair?
What, ... you are making some wisecracks in a night club... wo wo wo. The guy was in game SIX two runs down two outs facing elimination.
Because I cant call a woman with other people in the room. Come on, lets go.
I'm not gonna be nice. That's how I got the job.
Well there is traffic. It might take her till eight-fifteen.
I gotta go help her tape up all his boxes and get them ready for shipping.
Yeah, now I gotcha! (hangs up the phone and rushes out the door)
Oh, I don't think you want to do that.
Can I say one word to you? Lobster. The lobster here is unbelievable. (looks at the menu) Ooh, a little expensive.
Interference! You cant count that! Come on, are you crazy?! The coin cannot touch anything, it affects it.
That's it. This is it. I'm done. Through. It's over. I'm gone. Finished. Over. I will never work for you again. Look at you. (laughing) You think you're an important man? Is that what you think? You are a laughingstock. You are a joke. These people are laughing at you. You're nothing! You have no brains, no ability, nothing! (knocking object over on desk) I quit!
Jerry? I have to tell you something. This is the dullest moment Ive ever experienced.
I gotta call her. Should I call her?
It's really nothing, it's like going to the dentist.
So I really liked the pictures I picked up here yesterday.
You go in the living room. I'll take the test in here.
What was the tallest woman you ever slept with?
Jerry it's funny, Paula and I actually met because of Elaine.
Yeah, see, uh, when we met, I was over there and, uh, you were over here, so the image, uh, the image was reversed, like, uh, like in the mirror.
Well, Play Now has all kinds of different rubber balls. Why dont we test your bladder system at my office?
I noticed you eh, chose the eh "clowns with balloons" check design.
Except for one small problem. Hah, I left some books in her apartment.
I've been standing here for the last ten minutes!
Oh man! I knew I was gonna love the opera.
...yeah, my wife started getting on me about the lawn today. Im tellin you, its one thing after another.
Oh, no, no...condoms are for single men. The day that we got engaged, I said goodbye to the condom forever.
What are you talking about.. I WANT MY CAR!!
Listen, you go over to the ticket counter, I'm going to go stop in the gift shop and pick up a copy of Time magazine. There's supposed to ba blurb about Jerry in it and I think he mentioned my name!
He's right! It's the same thing with the femenists. You know, they want everything to be equal, everything! But when the check comes, where are they?
No no. That's not what I was trying to do.
I just thought of a great name for myself, if I ever become a porno actor.
Especially her. She does not like disappointment. Well, I have to do it. I can't make December. There's no way I can make December. Right? I mean, you can see that, right? I mean, look at me. Look. Look. Can I make December? I can't make December. Right? Look. Look.
(playing with toys) Ahhhh, Yes! Touch down! Your turn, Jerry. (hands Jerry the Mattel Football. George starts playing with the Etch-a-sketch.)
Of course not. You don't care what I look like.
Never mind what happened, just give me the key.
Lemme see this. (Tries to grab the papers.)
No, you go Guggenheim. I'm not much of a Guggenheim.
I didn't burn it down - Kramer did!
You know, about the uh, two of us getting together. And I know that I said I was engaged, but (laughs) uh, you know, it's really just something you say. It's like, going steady. You know uh, going steady, engaged, it's, it's all just stuff you say. (chuckles) Anyway, I was watching uh, My Cousin Vinnie, on the uh, on the tape the other day, and I was thinking that uh, you know, the two of us might take a meeting, as they say. (chuckles) So, what d'you, what d'you think?
Well hello. Um, ah, specifically the reason that I'm here, uh, I don't know uh what Elaine told you but uh I broke up with my girlfriend a couple of weeks ago. Actually she broke up with me [struggling with his coat zipper] and uh, well, I was the cause of it and uh, I just wanted to find out from you ... What's with this thing?
Well then, from out of nowhere, a huge tidal wave lifted me, tossed like a cork and I found myself right on top of him, (ELAINE gasps quietly Ahhhh) face to face with the blow-hole. I-I, I could barely see from the waves crashing down upon me but, I knew something was there so I reached my hand in, felt around and pulled out the obstruction!
You heard the man. I guess you gotta be moving your car.
(pleading) Elaine, c'mon. Would you just make the call? (indicates the phone) Please, make the call.
You know, a muffin can be very filling.
What do we have in the fruit department?
That's it? You don't have to screw it in or anything?
One... (Glenda seeing George is serious; gets up and leaves)
You remember the woman on the horse? She wanted my spot.
I can do hard time for this one. And community service!
Uh, nothing, lets get going. Come on. (laughs) hu hu.
Because, Jerry, it's a couple rule! We have to tell each other everything!
Kramer, this is perfect. I need you to go in there, pretend you're a doctor and check this guy for moles.
(Pointing to them) Office Christmas gift. I tell you, this Human Fund is a gold mine!
I am not! What you call wasting, I call living! I'm living my life!
A woman that hates me this much comes along once in a lifetime.
So go ahead pigeons. hu hu hu. Laugh it up. I'm getting in my car now and the last I heard ... we have NO DEAL!
(upset) But you can't stay here. There's no place to sleep!
I just can't believe at the way people are. What is it with humanity? What kind of a world do we live in?
Cut it. (goes back to the group) (Yelling) Would you stop signing?
Na, he's gone. I wonder what happened to him.
You don't work in the rain? Your a mailman."Neither rain nor sleet nor snow....."It's the first one.
(Smiling) You got it, Ma. (She smiles back, nodding) A little later. (George sits back in a nearby chair, looking at the divider in anticipation)
This is by far the most exciting thing I've ever done.
Fine. Steal the battery. Now, all right, here is the Frogger. This is the front door, and this is the outlet.
Alright, I'll tell you what you do. You call her back and give her the "it's me", heh? Pull the old switcheroo.
Excuse me just for a second. ( fixes his hair looking at his reflection in a coffee pot.)
Not as good. That's when you realize all the money you're losing.
(aggravated) Oh, that's not good enough! You don't try and de-sour. You have to sweeten too!
Anyway there was all this tension. I asked her if she wanted to go out to dinner and she said "no, maybe we could get together for lunch." You know what that means.
"Hey you know , I felt we had like a synergy out there,you know, like we were really helping each other."
Aha. Aha. Could it be because you don't want him to know that you have a friend who pees in the shower, is that it?!
I think it's neat. You don't hear that much about god anymore.
Beautiful women. You know they could get away with murder. You never she any of them lift anything over three pounds. They get whatever they want whenever they want it. You can't stop them.
Well, you really did it to me this time, Seinfeld. . . . What the hell happened here?
(animated) You're letting him have a woman over?!
Okay, go ahead. Call her, get married, have babies, have a great life.. What do I care? I'm finished. (Really depressed) It's all over for me. In fact, let's end it right now. Jerry, kill me, kill me now. I'm begging you. Let's just get it over with. Be a pal.. Just take the pillow and put it over my face.
Take care. Take it easy. (Tom leaves with the casting director)
You know, that, that thing about her being too good for him. I mean, I was just bein' folksy. They could tell I was just being folksy..?
Hey, Nina! (beat) I owe you some money, don't I?
A signal, right, um, okay, uh, okay, the signal is, Ill call out tippy-toe!
Yeah. Eric the Clown put it out with his big shoe.
Listen to this. Marcy comes up and she tells me her ex-boyfriend was over late last night, and "yada yada yada, I'm really tired today." You don't think she yada yada'd sex.
The only thing that bothers me is that I'm just coming up with this now.
You know they used to make leisure suits out of this fabric?
(spotting possible salvation) You know what, I urge you to take it up with him. Go ahead, give him a call, he'll tell you what I'm doing here. (half to himself) Then you can tell me.
Oh, yeah, right. I wish I had something on my mind. (pregnant pause) So how about that Kramer, huh?
What big salad? I'm going to the coffee shop.
Any more grape juice? (Gets up and goes to the kitchen. Remy moves to the end of the couch where George was sitting.)
No, Kramer. I have to have this statue.
Well you know, if you were sitting right next to her you'd have to console her no matter what.
You think you could hook me up with these guys?
Oh, sure. Of course. (looks for place to set down flowers) Um, uh, could you hold these? For just a second, just a second. (grabs newspapers from trash bin, begins wiping windshield) Here you go, now don't worry about a thing. It's gonna be fine. Here we go. Look at this shine.
So, I broke up with Maura. It's done. I'm out.
Well what did you want her to do, you left it on the night table.
All right, do you mind? I have the window! (To Willie) Now, what are you gonna do about my Twix?
I might tell her that I love her. I came this close last night, then I just chickened out.
Yeah. Got to invite The Drake. Listen hem...there's something that's been on my mind and we haven't really talked about it..I t's kind of important to me.
It's a huge problem, Jerry. The hardest part about having sex with a woman is getting her to come back to your place! He's already got that.
Oh, this is good. This Kruger guy is clueless. I can't wait to work for him.
I banged it on the desk in the doctor's office. An (worriedly rubbing his arm) aaaa . . .
I cant call her now. Its too soon. Im planning a Wednesday call.
This is a huge project involving lots of numbers and papers and folders.
I can't have an affair with a married woman, that's despicable!
Alright, fine.I'll drive the 3 hours each way, 6 hours all together, and take 'em off myself!!
Well, I like to stay in touch with the people.
So what?! She still gave you advice; what's the difference if she's not Chinese?!?!
Who says you gotta have a story? Remember when we were waiting for, for that table in that Chinese restaurant that time? That could be a TV show.
Y'know people, we got a situation over here!
I'm unbelievable at spelling last names. Give me a last name.
Because he made a big deal about how I understand everything immediately. That's what impressed him.
Yes, hello. Party's over. (taking off the suit)
(somewhat annoyed) I suppose you could be an architect.
I don't even like to sit next to a man on an airplane 'cause our knees might touch.
We should have left earlier. I told you.
Hey, the Bull owes me one, I helped him with his swing.
They're not here! You cost me fifty bucks!
You know, sometimes those guys don't make it back. (Looks in fridge) I'm really hungry.
Well I'm not starting up a whole new wardrobe now!!!
Ooooo, I'm scared. . . . Ohoooo they're not going to do the show.
You know, you're nuts with these sponges. George is gettin' frustrated!
If anyone should be forced to leave that place, it should be her!
He scratches off a 32 and he puts in 31.
I just wanted to talk to Tony for a minute (hands Elaine some stuff)
[quite out loud, not even pretending to whisper] Elaine!
We haven't heard his notes yet, we don't know how he feels about our work. (Russell throws up yet again.)
Or, I could take the twenty, then I could pay *you* later.
(Threatening) Hold it! One more step and were walkin!
Right.. the sign. (Hesitates, then makes a series of stupid gestures)
I dont know. But I dont. Im actually almost happy to hear it.
The attic? Y-you haven't wore any of those clothes for years.
This is very hard to follow with all the talking.
That's perfect! He's a zoo guy! He take's care of animals. C-Can I bring the squirrel by?
[Realizing full well it isn't] ...Yes it is.
Hey, at least I'm bringing something to this. (Starts flipping through envelopes, reads one ) "Have you seen me?" (Flicks it aside) Nope. (looks at next envelope) Woah, something from Whatley.
In any other shoe, I lose two inches. I - I can't have a drop down. We were eye to eye, I can't go eye to chin!
Of course. But I really wanna leave my mark this time, you know, uh. I wanna walk away from the Yankees with people saying 'Wow! Now that guy got canned!'
You know, we're living in a society! We're supposed to act in a civilized way.
Maybe she just wants to talk to me?
She probably gets that impression because you're cool. You're under control. Like me. Nothing wrong with that.
(sidling in) Is this a bad time? I hope I'm not disturbing anything.
No sports jacket? I don't need a sports jacket? Writers wear sports jackets.
There was a box of raisins on the coffee table. Did you, by any chance, take them with you when left?
I'm sure I have a low IQ. I've been lying about my SAT scores for 15 years.
Why does it always seem like I'm the only one working at this break-up?
I mean, big would even be ok, a little beyond big.
You know, all these years, I've always wanted to see the two of you get back together.
Oh, what are you, like, a Quaker now?
No, no. Forget it. I don't want it. Let's just get rid of it.
You know Keith, what I've always wondered, with all these ball clubs flying around all season don't you think there would be a plane crash? ...
As you care for me. Which is why it is very important that you never breathe a word of this to anyone about the... you know. What, with Clarence Thomas and everything.
Well don't let him take advantage of you like that.
That's it. That's the line... (squirts mustard into Jerry's coffee and stirs it) ...that destroyed my life.
By the way, how did Puddy get back in the picture?
(singing) Master of the house/Doling out the charm/Ready with a handshake and an open...
What could I do?! We fooled around and went to a movie!
I don't know what you're getting all riled up about. There are probably a million Costanzas-
Um, I don't uh, really think I can go.
Of course hes been in touch with him. Hes left two messages. He just hasnt heard back yet, thats all.
I know. And now they want me to bottle it up. It makes me so mad!
Because I'm a cheater! I had to tell you.
What's the deal with Aquaman? Could he go on land, or was he just restricted to water?
You haven't won. You may think you've won, but you haven't won. Do you know why? It's not over. This is not over. I'm not forgetting what's happening here. You have my ten dollars. I will get it back. Alright, don't worry. It's not over. I'm going now. Good bye. I will be back.
(on tape, singing) "Believe it or not, George, isn't at home, please leave a mes-saaage at the beep. I must be out or I'd pick up the pho-one. Where could I be? Believe it or not, I'm not hooome." (beep)
Nah, I guess I should really get moving on this, huh? I'm gonna go. (Opens the door, letting Newman in. Leaves)
Okay. "Breakfast At Tiffany's." (Begins to read, but gradually his attention is drawn to the TV Guide on the end table. George realizes there's a show on he wants to see by looking at his watch, and doesn't start the book.)
Oh, well, he was probably just getting anxious to start his vacation.
How are we gonna get out of here? We need a plan!
And it's their anniversary Friday night. I could send them for a hansom cab ride. Y -- you think they'd like that?
Isn't that why we have locks on the doors?
Oh, there's better, (pointing at the row in front of them) right there, that's better.
You have my spare-key in your apartment, right?
Hold on. Hold on. Wait a minute. How am I gonna get the rye bread into the apartment?
I'd love to be a Civil War buff. ... What do you have to do to be a buff
(to Elaine) He asked you to get the mail?
Is she the only girl in the whole world? Why can't you get find your own girl?
You can't break up with me. I've got hand.
No Don't get the camera , we don't need the camera. Listen I know your skeptical , but I really believe in the Chinese.
Anyway, I was thinking about what you said. About uh, me and Marisa.
(Not sure what the answer should be) What do you want to hear?
Oh yeah.. (Starts to open it) Sally called Susan - said you guys really hit it off.
Why? Why isn't it possible? I mean, they're both bite marks.
I, uh, just think it's a little unusual. Two people to sit on one side...and leave the other side empty.
Oh no no no, they don't want to join us.
Are you kidding me? [Elaine walks past the window glancing in] This is the best tool we have today of measuring a persons' intelligence.
you better be careful on those rocks tomorrow buddy. And you're not getting any sandwiches either
She might be leaving to work any minute.
My parents don't read! They're gonna wonder what a book is doing on the table!
I wanna get it back when we were the Gatsbys.
Who am I going to tell? My mother? Like I've got nothing better to talk about.
(thinking) Oh my God, it's 701. What have I done? My whole plan is depending on Kramer? Have I learned nothing? How could I make such a stupid mistake? He'll never show up!
You know, I have to tell you something. You couldn't get me on a plane right now. I get those FAA reports directly. My uncle sends them to me, he used to be a pilot, so. Big investigation in the, uh, what's the word there, uh, offing. It's in the offing. But, you know, you shouldn't let that stop you from going. You could go. I don't mind.
There was something so reassuring about that cozy little space.
Anyway, so he gave me his spare keys, now he wants to have my keys, so I need mine back from you.
You were supposed to deliver my calzones. We had a deal!
No, no, no... Just a *tiny* bit... It's not even *frontal* nudity. It's... *sidal* nudity...
You know, Einstein wore the exact same outfit every day.
Oh, you lying little snot. And he's a cheater. Aren't ya' you little twerp?
When are they gonna learn that any news about China is an instant page-turner? (seeing Jerry with a small black device) What's that?
Summer of '89 I'm at the beach. This family sits up next to me. I go in to the surfs and when I come from out, my clothes, my towel, my umbrella, they're all gone. I am furious, I start screaming to these kids demanding my stuff back and finally I lose it; I grab their boom box and I chuck it in to the ocean.
Yes! Yes. You know. She didn't know about Pasteurization. He didn't know anout Fumigation. But they made it work!
Hey, there's a tomato stand, let's stop, I can get some more.
Seemingly. Seemingly. But within that basic framework there are many subtle variations, only discernable to an acute observer, that reflect the many moods, the many shades, the many sides of George Costanza.
All right, shmoopies...what's it gonna be? Pick a theater.
I saw them making out, you can believe it.
On an elevator? You met a woman on an elevator?
Well, my father works for the United Volunteers, maybe he can get her one.
(Laughs) Relationship intern...hey, what if two of us teamed up?
So I'm sure whatever germs it landed on were knocked out, and by the time the rest of them realised what was going on, you had already grabbed it out.
Yeah, well you have to maintain the same disposition too. You can't start acting any differently. You have to be nice.
No no no, you know actually we are friends of a serial killer.
If anything happens here, can I count on you?
I told them I have a place in the Hamptons. What did you say?
Hey, you gotta take a ride with me later. I borrowed my father's car. '68 GTO.
It's worth a shot. (Goes to the door.)
You know, I can't talk to you anymore.
What was wrong with that? I had a different interpretation! Do you know anything about this pretzel guy?! Maybe he's been in the bar a really long time and he's really depressed because he has no job and no woman and he's parking cars for a living! (out the window to honking cars) Alright! Alright! Shut up! Shut up! I hear you! I'm coming down! These pretzels are making me thirsty!
Not a plane crash. (leaving) Is it a plane crash?
Well, if she keeps horsing around with that tractor--
tsh (snorts) Ah, yeah, we've - we've talked . . . I believe I can speak for the both of us on this.
I doubt it. You know what he's doing now? He's putting a pool table in my old bedroom.
Jerry, I like being with her. Plus, I know where she is all the time. I have relatively no competition. An-and you know how you live in fear of the pop-in?
She's not there. She left. She must've waited and left because those people wouldn't get off the phone.
Well, Danielle, (digs in his pocket) we should get going. I got a key made for you.
Hum..( to Elaine) Hey! did you talk to Paula?
Allright, I gotta head back right away, I'll-Ill -- I gotta figure something out here.
I dont know. But Simons said that if I wanted to get involved, that Wilkinson would tell me the exact right minute to sell. You wanna do it?
She said "sweep together" you idiots, not "sleep together."
What about the whole Christmas spirit thing? Any flexability there?
What do you know? You were in the nut house.
One of the guys in my cell threw a piece of gum at him.
Had to come in and maybe well get together? Had to and maybe?
I know the D is the biggest. I've based my whole life on knowing that the D is the biggest.
Ah, I've had everything on the menu. Uh, surprise me.
You don't understand. He's got this big party coming up. He's been looking forward to this for months. This is gonna destroy the whole thing.
Oh... do I have to write him a note or something?
Excuse me, are you going to be much longer? I have to make a very important call.
Yeah, I thought I might give her a call. I, I don't meet that many women. I meet like three women a year. I mean, we've been introduced. She knows my name.
I know, but don't say anything to anyone. He told me not to tell you.
Well, I like a rolling writer. They're very smooth.
All right, I've got to go down to the unemployment office. Wanna take a walk?
Youre a back-up, youre a second-line, a just-in-case, a B-plan, a contingency!
Ah, alright. Believe me, that kid's gonna be called Soda.
You have no idea how refreshing that is.
Shhh What is wrong with you? You never tell 'em you like the car. (Advising) You're not sure what you want. You don't even know why you're here.
(To Jerry) We got work to do. What about the meeting?
Well, sure Joey, sure, I would be thrilled.
Yeah. Hmm. Boy these really do pinch. I tell you, if I ever find the son of a bitch that stole my glasses...
I know, I know, I can't stop it!
You think the person you were talking to is him? That's not even close to him. He's funny, Jerry's funny.
Jerry gargles? Is that why he takes so long?
She put them in her pocket book. She probably took them out there with her.
When Lupe makes up the beds in the morning.
I said, would you like to go for a walk or something.
You are a genius, it's as simple as that.
(emerging from bathroom, buttoning his shirt) A gymnast! I can't believe it, you didn't tell me she was a gymnast.
(While skimming a Monk's menu) You know, I didn't go to the bathroom the entire time we were in India.
I would like to dip my bald head in oil and rub it all over your body. [No reaction] You don't understand! It's a miracle! You don't understand because you don't speak English!
Going to need a little more coffee here.
Yes! 860,000. I can't believe it's still standing. No one has beaten me in like 10 years.
...so mind you, at this point I'm only going out with her two or three weeks. So she goes out of town and she asks me to feed her cat. So at this time, there's a lot of stuff going on in my life and, uh, it slips my mind for a few days. Maybe a week. Not a week, five, six days.
I tried! I almost threw it down the incinerator, but I couldn't do it. The guilt was too overwhelming. (Grabs the doll, opening the door to leave) Susan's so attached to this thing.
"throws your hips off kilter" So where's your money? (pulls out his wallet)
And then I hear this rabbi on television, I mean imagine.
(to Jay) What do you think it is?
I'm George.. George Costanza.. I've never been in the hospital a day in my life.. except when I had my tonsils out. You know, they never gave me any ice cream. I always felt that-
I can produce Keith Hernandez right here within the hour.
Only if you buy. I gotta make a sale.
No, no, I don't think I'm special. My mother always said I'm not special.
She dragged me down to that warehouse on the waterfront in Brooklin to see one of her "performances".
(ignoring Jerry) I mean I'm not really working right now.
I'm a man. Jerry, I'm a man. And do you know why? It's because of that talk we had. You were my inspiration. Do you believe it? You. That lunch was the defining moment of my life.
I got it from the Institute. The Institute.
Ohh, I have tremendous respect for people who work with feet. I mean, to dedicate yourself to the foot - you're toiling in virtual anonymity. I mean..
They don't need any water, so you don't have to keep taking them to the bathroom.
So concerned was he, that word of his poor tennis skills might leak out, he chose to offer you his wife as some sort of mediaeval sexual payola?
Oh, nothin' much, . . . talkin'. . . . Oh, oh, oh, did I have an unbelievable idea today!
What's so hard about that? How am I supposed to get it in there? I can't just walk in with it. I have to get the Rosses out of the apartment!
Salsa is now the number one condiment in America.
Well, that interests me very much Mr. Farkus.Very much indeed, sir.
Let me be the architect! I can do it!
Because great couples always have a great story about how they met. That's why I've never been in a long term relationship. I've never had a good meeting story.
(Outraged) "That's all"?! That's everything! I don't know what all the rest of it is for anyway!
So, how come nothing ever happened between you and Nina? (Getting paranoid) Is there a problem with her? Is she a man?
What if she becomes Miss America? You could be dating Miss America, Jerry!
Get up, get up, its her! Oh, the hell with this, Im scared to death, just walk away, its off, cancel everything, go!
So--ah, Kramer. Why'd you ask me out to dinner? (amused) An' why Pomodoro?
No problem there. Conformity is an obsession with me.
You're considering hiring me for your latex salesman.
Oh well, gracias El Commandante, gracias. Muy muy.
Why not? It's a good look for a woman.
Just put it on! All right now, remember she had her nails done today so remark how you like the color. And if you need me you beep me, all right. Here you go, hey, hey, hey, hey...(sprays Binaca into Jerry's mouth.) Go get'em you're a tiger!
No, you're not a divorcee. Youre just separated. You're---you're a separatee.
(laughs hysterically, gesticulating wildly) This is all blowing up in my face! My serious girlfriend, and my torrid love affair have accidentally crossed paths. I have ruined three lives... (grabbing coat) Well, I understand if you never want to see me again, so... (points towards door)
All right. So, what theatre you wanna go to tonight? We got 61st and 3rd or 84th and Broadway.
I think we got a bite on it. (Exits)
I mean, now she thinks that I'm one of these guys that love her. Nobody wants to be with somebody that loves them.
You know, you could've just given me Neil's number. You..you didn't have to take me out to dinner.
(getting up and leaving) Alright! That's it for me. Goodnight everybody.
I got up, I was supposed to go to work, I came here instead.
It was kinda fun. (Elaine gives Jerry a cold cloth for his jaw.) You know, maybe his name really is J-O-H-N, but he changed it to J-O-N for show business. Well, you know, J-O-N is a lot zippier.
Yeah. I think we really go something here.
Okay. (They walk around each other.) OK. Ill choose you. Whaddaya want?
Yeah, sure. (big smile) Then my father will have no place to sleep. (snaps fingers) He's gotta move out.
(Yelling out to the whole coach) Funny guy! (Points to Jerry) Right here!
OK Look, the gum isn't cutting it for me. We need to be about something else...anything..please.
I tell ya, I hear people really stuff themselves on those cruise ships. (Laughs) The buffet, that's the real ordeal, huh, Clarence? (Laughs)
Of course, I'm the result of my parents having stayed together, so you never know. (Russell comes out of the bathroom.)
Well what would be the point of that?
They want you to do a TV show?
I do too. you see that's what we're about . You don't remind me of anyone and we love gum.
Oh, look, he's going to ask you about my arm. So, just tell him I banged it against a desk. And it's been moving involuntarily ever since.
Jerry, I'm not suggesting getting rid of the girl. She's integral.
Whew! Boy, it's cold outside, huh? Oh, these New York winters, huh. Bitter cold, bitter.
Excuse me...huh... I think I made a big mistake. I'd like my deposit back please.
What do the Chinese have to gain by faking a cure for baldness?
(Looks fed up with his parents) Oh my God..
They're reorganizing the staff, and I'm on thin ice with this guy as it is.
Oh, no no no, I'm fine. Let me help you with these dishes, huh?
I don't know. Perhaps I can better serve the world this way.
It's "ooh" As in "ooh ooh ah ah."
Makes the 11 gauge look like a cap pistol.
Uh, yeah, I'll be there in a minute.
Wow! Heh. (Half kidding) You don't, huh, have a replacement lined up for me, do ya? heh he he he he he...
Well...I was in the locker room showering, and I...I had to go, so...
Well, then, I am gonna have to ask you to turn your key.
Hey, hey, let's not get so defensive here. This is a give and take process.
I can't carry a pen. I'm afraid I'll puncture my scrotum.
Hmm, what's he doin' in the city today?
I just wanted to talk to him for a minute, but Ill come back.
Fitted Hat Day! That's what you asked Steinbrenner for?
(attempting sincerity) As much as I'd like to see the two of you living it up in a warm, tropical, setting, I, I would just miss you too much. (smiling) So, I've decided, I want you to stay.
Dad, the hinges are all rusted here. That's why the wind keeps blowing the door off.
What are we gonna tell Jerry about the car?
Shes a pig. The woman's a pig, what wrong with her--
That's him over there. The one that looks like a blowfish.
What difference does it make what she looks like?
You know. You use the, uh...(mutters something unintelligible under his breath.)
Beautiful lineswoman. Alright listen uh I'm going to go to the concession stand and get some real sunblock. You want anything? Jerry? (Jerry is staring at the lineswoman) Jerry?
This is not good. This is not good.
Great! I ate the entire platter! Had to call in sick today.
That damn delicatessen that - that is last time they screw up one of my orders.
It it's huge. It's probably like North Dakota.
Yeah, when the season starts. Right now, I sit around pretending that I'm busy.
They, uh... said you were with some guy who was wearing a cape?...
So, attractive one day - not attractive the next?
(starts to try to get passed Jerry and Elaine) Alright get out of my way. (Jerry and Elaine push him back, George very annoyed) Alright don't make me get physical here!
He wouldn't put it on if he didn't like it.
Im not going with him. I dont even know the guy. (to the teller) Look, they did this for me before.
Well, you know, it's really very funny, because you know what we got here, really? We really, really, just have a terrible misunderstanding. You see, when I passed on the deal, I thought that's what Jerry wanted me to say. Y'know, I, I misinterpreted.
And get a picture of him, with his shirt off.
Because I know him too, and probably a lot better than you.
See now that bothers me even more than dying bothers me, cause it's people like you who live to be a hundred and twenty because you're not bothered by it. How could it not bother you?
You arms look like something hanging in a kosher deli.
(smiling) Uh, hi. Uhm, remember me? I..I'm the guy who looks like Neil?
Elaine? It's me, George. (Elaine opens the door.) Hey, sorry to bother you so late. (To Billy) Hey! How ya doin.' (To Elaine) Uh, did you get any of those sponges?
(gleeful, to Estelle) You did?! That's Goood! That's very good! I'm very glad to hear that.
Lemme tell you sum'in. When Ponce looked in that mirror and saw that he hadn't changed, and that tear started to roll down his cheek? ... I lost it.
You know what you should do? You should tell this guy you're seeing somebody else. That's the easiest way to get out of these things.
(Struggling) No, no, no, no. I can walk it off. It's a hundred and twenty degrees in here.. I'll sweat it out.
Stop it, stop it! It's not fair. It's not fair. I don't like this situation, Jerry. I don't like it one bit.
Ladies. I, uh, I haven't seen this before.
Cause I tell you, frankly, I would like to walk in hear one day and find you sitting down. (Starts to walk out of the store) That would give me a lot of pleasure. Call me crazy.
Oh, no no no -- We bought the wine here before, but now, you know we're bl-blocked in by some car double parked and we're just waiting for the guy to pull out.
Listen, lemme ask you a question. What if I got a cup of coffee with her?
Oh my God...You're in jail? (Celia nods.) That is so cool!
Drink your soda! Come on! I know you're there, laughing at me. Laughing and lying and laughing! I had to go to Reggies, Jerry! Reggies!
Why couldn't you squeeze one of those stupid rubber balls to get your stress out? Why did you have to destroy *twenty-five* computers?
Were aware of the proximity to the park, yes.
I know what the problem is - I like her too much. That's why I can't make a move.
(taking the phone from Elaine) Jerry, why is Elaine getting your mail?
$2? But everyone in front of me got free bread.
Yes, the surprise blindfold greeting. That wasnt in the manual, I dont know.
My name is George. I'm unemployed and I live with my parents.
Yeah, yeah, yeah we could. You know, ah, Kramer, the next time you talk to her, find out if she knows Kelly, from Monk's. I wanna know if she really has a boyfriend.
The whole time that I was growing up, all I ever heard from my mother was 'Why can't you be more like that Lloyd Braun?'
Alright, now, how are we gonna monitor this thing?
Oh... (George looks around and sees the chef hiding behind a plant it's Bob!)
So, just bring her here. This is all you really need.
I didn't know you were such a Bette Midler fan.
So, they go off for the ride, by the time they come back the bread is there.
What are you? A *baby*!? All right. Tell her.
Were having lunch with a friend. He works in the building.
(oozing fake sincerity) Well, as much as I enjoy all the good-natured ribbing, nothing really makes me happier than spending money on the people I care about.
It's Allison. I dated her right after you. She's obsessed with me.
Were you just talking about me? What's going on?
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas! (Co-worker gives a gift to George) Oh, Sandy! Here is a little something for you.. (hands her a card)
Oh, it's a bad day. Uh, you got everyone in your house, you're thinkin', "These are my friends?!"
(dials) Hi, are you OK? no, no,.. huh, (hangs up) She hung up.
Yeah, that's what I want-- triangles. Alright, I'm outta here. Have fun with what's-her-name.
That's a lot of pressure. Make love to me. What am I, in the circus? What if I can't deliver?
What come on? Have you ever dated a woman that worked in your office?
Not really. Your voice kind of raises to this comedic pitch. (Kramer enters)
She invites me up at twelve oclock at night, for coffee, and I dont go up. No thank you. I dont want coffee. It keeps me up. Too late for me to drink coffee. I said this to her. People this stupid shouldnt be allowed to live. I cant imagine what she must think of me.
Ah, shut up, Jerry. My parents think they can ignore me. Heh heh. Well, they better think again.
you know, just by conversing, you can really learn a lot about a person.
Yeah, the kind that Castro smoked. You can't buy ?em anywhere.
To do what?! Work in a post office? Is that what you want me to do?
Every summer you guys went to camp together. I was jealous. Felt like he was the summer me.
What could I do? Did you see the mug on that kid?
I tell ya, I am hooked on these books on tape.
Then, why? Why did you make me drive all the way out here? Why didn't you say something? Why? Why? Why?
A plane crash? A Heart attack? Lupus? Is it Lupus?
Nothing, I... said it was a little problem.
Elaine, I'm, I'm shocked. I'm shocked. Here I go out in the spirit of the season (Elaine looking like she's not buying a word of it) and spend all my savings to buy you the most beautiful Christmas sweater I have ever seen to show my appreciation to you at Christmas and this is the thanks that I get at Christmas.
Great. Jerry, I gotta tell you, I had the BEST TIME with that Nina last night. I - I think I'm in love with her already. You are a great friend. (Hugs Jerry) A great, great friend.
You know a lost and found could be a good idea.
Just one? I'm living like twenty. (chuckles) What's yours?
(melancholy) I wish that was all needed. Life can be so confusing. I..I'm searching for answers, anywhere.
(still quiet) Think, a second. You know, your friend was talking about me and, you know...
I said 'God bless you'. Was that so wrong?
So I said, "Mr. Hayman, It's me george Costanza, JFK, ... " He doesn't move. So I said uh, "Can't stand ya'", "Can't stand ya'" He turns and smiles, the little baked bean teeth. I get up to run away, but something was holding me back. It was Heyman. He had my underwear. There I was on the steps of the 42nd St. library , a grown man, getting a wedgie.
...and the Jews steal our money through their Zionist occupied government and use the black man to bring drugs into our oppressed white minority communities.
Where are you gettin' a Wizard for fifty dollars?
That's the sign! The test; if a - if a man makes it move.
You're not going to get back here in time!
(offers his) Oh, you want to taste mine.
Nothing It's not you. It's me. I have a fear of commitment. I don't know how to love.
Are you sure? Oh, look who I'm talking to. The president of NBC. (forced laughter)
I was personable. Don't you think I was personable?
Of course he should consider it, but now is not the time!
I had to say something. (chuckles) I had to say something. Everything was going so well. I had to say something.
I told her I liked her. Why? Why did I tell her I like her? I have this sick compulsion to tell women how I feel. I like you I dont tell you.
Perhaps. (hehe) I walk in, everything is organized -- messages, appointments. And I can't tell you how proud I am of myself for going with Ade.
(angry, to himself) The ocean called. Running outta shrimp. Outta shrimp! (a thought occurs) Oh! Yes! That's what I shoulda said! (frustrated shout) Dammit!
You're my mother! What wouldn't I do for you?
No no no, that's in the right position.
Kramer, I cant believe it. Oh, youre my hero!
Im starving! I can feel my stomach sucking up against my spine.
I don't understand, how do these thieves start the car?
I've got to tell you, I'm really disappointed in Lupe.
Listen uh, David, I, I, I want to apologize about that comment
Yeah,yeah!! I'll pick you up right now.....All right All right....Hey! gotta go.
(Vowing) Well, I'll tell you this, though - I am never doing.. that , again.
No, no, I mean, driving Susan to lesbianism.
Alright, alright, but no funny business, same deal as last night.
Right. And, and to cover my nervousness I started eating an apple, because I think if they hear you chewing on the other end of the phone, it makes you sound casual.
we rode along all the way to the hospital
Ah, no, no. Are you sure? A girlfriend?
Excuse me, uh I couldn't help but notice that you were looking in my direction.
Can I uh, can I walk you back to work?
Course, I wouldn't, I mean uh, the guy is uh, well obviously (to Cynthia, as she passes) the guy has his problems.
(Very loud in the direction of a waiter) I'm gonna need a coffee here. Very hot! Boiling!
Yeah, and I - I heard you got on their good side. Now, what'd you do?
He's extremely Murphy. He's Murphy to a fault.
The show will be like a heart attack!
(chuckles) Really? Well, we'll just see about that. Ta-ta, Tut-tle.
(standing) Oh yeah, Reilly? (smugly) Well, the jerk store called. They're running outta you
(animated) What're you kidding me? We were all getting along so well. Where is all this coming from?
I was jumping over a puddle, and for some reason I went like this. (George stretches out his arms in a ballet motion) And they called me a Mary. So I chased them, and I tripped and I fell.
I dont understand why you spend time with this guy.
Busy. Don't give me busy. Who's not busy? I'm busy, we're all busy, everybody's busy. All right, tell me, what's kept you so busy?
I don't think we should see each other any more.
Guys, hitting is not about muscle. It's simple physics. Calculate the velocity, v, in relation to the trajectory, t, in which g, gravity, of course remains a constant. (Hits a home run) It's not complicated.
Well I think I'm better off going one-on-one.
Hey check this out. I go to pick up my pictures and she says " I hope you got that mustard stain out of your shirt."
Heh, haa. And that's no good. I've tried it straight, Jerry. We've all seen the results. For me, sick is the only way to go.
(delighted) Jerry? It was incredible! Models! As far as the eye could see!
What is with this dog, I thought we were taking it to the pound.
We're perfect. I timed this out so we would pull up at the terminal *exactly* 17 minutes after their flight is supposed to land. That gives them just enough time to get off the plane, pick up their bags and be walking *out* of the terminal as we roll up. I tell you, it's a thing of beauty. I can not express to you the feeling I get from a perfect airport pickup. (starts looking around) What's going on? What are you doing? The Long Island Expressway? What are you getting on the Long Island Expressway for? Do you know what the traffic will be like? This is a suicide mission!
Yeah, right. I'll just go up and say, "Hi, how ya' doing? Would you like a glass of white wine?" JERRY Before you got within twenty feet of this woman, she'd have her finger on the mace button. She's like an expensive car with one of those motion-sensor force field alarms. Any sudden movement in the area could set her off.
Wait, as a matter of fact, wasn't there some guy in your building that you said you liked? He lived up on the fifth floor or something.
Sir, I just got a call from the terrorist. I told him to call back here.
I like to stop at the duty free shop!
Yeah, yeah. I see the irony. All right. What about this? What if I can find some way to break up with her so that she'll still like me and it doesn't affect the deal.
Out of the question. Out of the question!
I go in to use his private bathroom, everybody uses it, and then I get a memo - a memo - telling me to use the men's room in the hall. Well, (laughing) I mean we share it with Pace Electronics. It's disgusting!
'scuse me. I uh, I was in here this morning and uh, I believe I paid you with a twenty dollar bill, (smiles) but you only gave me change for a ten.
It's in Detroit though, it's an expensive flight.
You know, when I was a kid, we didn't have these elaborate birthday parties w-with catered food and entertainment. I remember my 7th birthday party...
Alright, that's it. Alright, good, eight thousand dollars. (to Cynthia) Cynthia, again, nice meeting you. Have I commented on the shoes? I love suede, it's so thick and rich. Did you ever, you ever rub it against the grain? Alright, anyway...
Of course. Your massage. (winks) Enjoy your massage. (winks)
Because you're a gymnastics teacher. It's only natural.
I can't get a massage from a man.
(urgent) Mr Wilhelm, listen. You've been abducted! Please, Mr Wilhelm, you gotta listen to me!
You wanna sell computers? I will show *you* how to sell computers! Hello, Mr. Farneman. You wanna buy a computer? No? Why not? All right, I see! Good answer! Thank you! (Lloyd rings his sale bell) Serenity now!
Well I didn't know you wanted to go to the flea market.
(cocky laughter) Huh haha! (shouts) You're meat, Reilly! You just screwed yourself! (laughter) Ha ha!
Because of me? You must be joking! Who wouldn't want to live because of me? I'm nothing!
Yes, they are bold. Jerry, what do you think?
Nougat? Please. I think Ive reached the point in my life where I can tell the difference between nougat and cookie. So lets not just say things that we both know are obvious fabrications.
All right Mrs. S. I and my good pal Keith Hernandez will be right back.
Excuse me, uh, what are you doing in there?
It's "Guys And *Dolls*", not "Guys And *Guys*".
(Quick, excited talking) Hey, hey! You can't believe this. Look at this check! (Hands it to Jerry) They told me I had the most beautiful hands they'd ever seen in their lives - except for this McKigney guy - this great looking girl gave me her phone number.. I got it! I got it all! I'm busting. Jerry, I'm busting!
Well, he is. I, uh, I live around the corner.
Oh! Nuts! Excellent! You know what I love? How there's two nuts named after people. Hazel...and filbert.
No. Nothing. Fine. (he sits at the table)
(TO JERRY, SOMEWHAT IMPRESSED) A Red Chinese prison?
Probably because this whole Universe is against me!
Why shave every day? It just grows right back.
They would never tell me, Elaine. First of all, they probably think that I killed Susan. Besides, I don't even think they like me. (Jerry comes over to the table.)
Wait a minute, call the car phone, see what happens.
It's a little unusual. So, uh, Susan and I were thinking, uh, dinner at our house Saturday night. Just the four of us.
Well, I feel better already. I'm feelin' like a good person.
I don't know. She..She's having some problems with this guy she's seeing.
Alright, now you're gonna see some parallel parking. (spitting into his hands and rubbing them together) How I wish you could make a living parallel parking. (turning around in his seat) It's all geometry, knowing all the angles, when to make that first turn and then when to swing it back in, that's the key.
La-la Land. I got the window seat, right?
Hey. You know, do I have a case for you guys to do on L.A. Law.
We ordered the wedding invitations today,, Nothing can stop it now. Nothing. It's here! It's happening. Can I do this? I can't do this...Look at me. Look at me I can't do this, I can't do this (manic) Help me Jerry, help me.
No, she left. Listen, you can't mention any of this to Elaine. Cynthia will kill me, we made a deal.
Which market, the, eh, big one, the big market, the big board. Bull market, bear market, you name the market, I'm there.
Huh... Cape... (turns, distracted, heads slowly towards door) What was a man with a cape doin' with my father?... What was my father doing with a man in a cape?... (opens door) Why a cape? Hmm! (exits)
Well what if she calls me? What am I supposed to say?! (hand hits the table)
He's actually doing him a favor. It's less money for him to buy food.
I heard the last guy got fired because his nose whislted.
Hi (raises his left hand in a slight gesture to say hi)
So you're buying the car back for your parents?
Personally I'm a little nervous about going through these things. I'm afraid I'm gonna step through into another dimension.
Yeah. (Jerry nodding) ... Oh, you think because of what I said about the manure. I wa, wa, was just saying how it takes a negative thing, and puts it on a positive spin on it.
(on a pay phone) Hey, hey, it's George, I need ya to do me a favor.
The Rogue's Wallet. That's where he kept his card, his dirty little secret. Short, devious, balding. his name was Costanza. He killed my mother.
Would you like a Pepto-Bismol? I keep them in my wallet...! (Russell goes into the bathroom and shuts the door.) (To Jerry) Do you think he liked it? (From the bathroom, we hear Russell violently heaving his guts.)
Algae, obviously plankton, hmhm. I don't know what else I could tell ya, ah, Oh I-I just got back from a trip to the Galapagos Islands, I was living with the turtles.
Na no, I'm not good in these situations. I can't hide my pity. I..I make em feel worse.
You want to hear more? The master bedroom opens into the solarium.
Listen. Let me ask you something. If you and Mona were ever to... dance, how do you decide who leads? I mean... do you take turns? Do you discuss it beforehand? How does that work?
No, Ill put half a can of mousse in my head like you.
(in the threshold between the living room and the kitchen) The thing that bothers me the most, is the lying.
He's on the lamb(?), he's on the loose!
Only I hold the answer key to their true candy identities. And so, without further ado, I give you the candy line-up. (Opens a door to a back room. Various dealership employees are munching on candy bars)
Oh, well, uh. Gary told me you said hi.
(worried) Alright, alright. Look, we're people, you and me, huh? Businessmen. Colleagues, if I may. Let's not quibble. We'll do it for the thirteen thousand. Thirteen thousand, and I never came up here, we never talked, alright. You take good care. (moving past Russell toward the door) It was nice seeing you again, and nice meeting you. (to Cynthia) Cynthia, right?
I'm trying to get out of this Big Brother program. So when you get to Paris (handing Morty the postcards) all you have to do is drop 'em in any mailbox.
Well, you see, what happened was...the doctor - the very same doctor that was attending to my late aunt - suffered an untimely stroke, and lost the use of his right hand, so...obviously I was unable to get the death certificate. However, I do have this. (Reaches inside his coat and takes out a Polaroid photo.)
I love the mirror in that bathroom! I dont know what in the hell it is. I look terrific in that mirror. (George sits.) I dont know if its the tile or the lighting... I feel like Robert Wagner.
What ever they had. Miranda thinks I'm a butcher but i-i-it's not my fault is it? Don't we have a deal with the pigeons?
(frustrated) Take it easy! Huh! Take it easy!
Oh. Oh. Yeah, sure. Here. Uh, sit down. Uh, uh, cheese, there? (he grabs a suit jacket from the desk chair and puts it on)
Regardless. I had to walk around for the rest of the party in some cheap Metlife windbreaker. Now, it is payback time.
No. This is not cotton. Here, lemme see. (Tries to look at the tag on the uniform. Tartabull gets creeped out and resists.) Will you stop it? (Looks at the tag.) Oh. Of course. Polyester!
Well, I was buttering myself up for a nice shave --
Alright, I gotta go home and open up with the house for the carpet cleaners. You know they're doing my whole place for twenty-five dollars.
I don't know. I closed my eyes and made a move.
You know, I think I'm a little bit scared of her. She's five-three, like a hundred pounds. I'm frightened to death of her.
Assistant to the travelling secretary. (fishing for a reaction) I'm uh, working on the project.
Oh yes I am Father. Incredibly sincere. So, uh, pffft, am I in?
So I spoke a little to your little friend Denise last night.
I went to the beach. (Jerry and Elaine exchange looks)
Yes I'd like to speak to Marisa Tomei, please? Marisa, Hi it's George Costanza.. I'm the short, funny, quirky bald man you met a little while ago, heh! yeah I was just calling 'cos I wanted you to know that I'm not engaged anymore......well huh, She died....Toxic glue from the wedding invitations.....well we were expecting about two hundred people. Yeah... Anyway.. hum I got the funeral tomorrow but huh.. my weekend is pretty wide open and I was wondering... (dial tone interrupts George)..... Hello...Hello..
Because Im not Latvian Orthodox. Her parents wont let her get involved with anyone who isnt Latvian Orthodox.
Yeah. Thanks for, thanks for coming by fellas. Eh, got a set of keys, buried in the pothole.
You just gave them to him two days ago, he's gotta give you a grace period.
If she want's to continue to have a fibre of her being she'll be very careful (hitting each other)
I'll get him to see a real doctor. You just stay away from this.
(Stern) No, ma, I'm not gonna see a psychiatrist. N- I don't care if you do pay for it! No! Discussion over. Yeah, alright, I'll see you later. Yes, of course I'm gonna come by. Alright. (Hangs up, slamming it down on the coffee table. He sits down next to Jerry) My mother wants me to see a psychiatrist now. Why?! Because she caught me? (Scoffs, shaking his head) You know, if everyone who did that had to go see a psychiatrist.. (Laughing, he snorts)
Anyway, I-I would like to-to pay for the cleaning.
Ever since I found out that you let that message on Jerry's tape recorder I...
You don't know what that spot means to him. Once he gets it, he doesn't go out for weeks.
Uh Jerry, how long will you be in there?
I think Play Now is putting something in my food.
Between the car getting totalled, the towing charge and the fine, there's no way I can ever pay him back...
I don't know, it sounds like pigeons or something!
Boy, my knuckles are still cramped from that football game.
...and then when I saw the photo I remembered where I'd seen him; the boom box incident.
Then I asked her if she wanted a drink.
All right, but we're not buyin' it at Bloomingdale's. I will buy it, you pay me back later. I'll sniff out a deal. I have a sixth sense.
Im okay. Im fine. Im wonderful. I never felt better in my whole life.
Come on, wanna give me a hand with the computers?
Its a Twix! Theyre all Twix! It was a setup! A setup, I tell ya! And youve robbed it! Youve all screwed me again! Now, gimme one! Gimme a Twix!
Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute, don't tell me, don't tell me. It starts with a . . . Duncan Meyers. Oh, wow, this is something. I haven't seen you guys in what, twenty years?
Yeah, they're all through ruining my life. What the hell are they still doing here? Lemme see this pamphlet. Hm. All right, so I'll, uh, get back to you.
Ho ho ho ho! I can't wait for Hanke to come crawling back to me.
(hesitant) Uh, Mr Wilhelm. Uh, about the project...
. . . I thought the woman was kind of cute.
So, Marcy, you should've seen me in the hot tub yoday.
You don't understand. A garage. I can't even pull in there. It's like going to a prostitute. Why should I pay, when if I apply myself, maybe I could get it for free? (he hears a horn honking) What? What do you want? Go around me, I'm looking for spaces.
And I always take care of my Pisano's. So here is a little something. (drop in tip and worker looks the other way, so George decides to take it out and try again only to get caught)
Really? I thought you and Celia were sleeping together?
Because important things go in a case. You got a skull for your brain, a plastic sleeve for your comb, and a wallet for your money.
Jerry, could you excuse us for a few minutes, please?
They're -- They're killing independent George! And they're, they're all in on it! World's are colliding!
You said the guy gave you an open-lipped kiss!
I was so shocked I was lucky I said anything.
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, go. Go about your business, I'll just wander around.
Then I see my clothes floating out there. The tied took them out, not the kids.
(Shocked) She's pregnant? Leslie is pregnant?! Oh, see, there is no justice.
I couldn't help it! Elaine moved the mirror, I got discombobulated.
What is that? Its ridiculous! You dont even know what hotel shes staying at, you cant call her. Thats a signal, Jerry, thats a signal! (snaps his fingers) Signal!
See, I knew it. I knew this was gonna happen...
She's like a district attorney. If it's not the truth, I'll break under the cross. I actually have to do it.
I don't even know Peterman. How the hell am I gonna relax? I'm gonna have to be on all night. I don't like being on, Jerry, I would much rather be off.
I believe strongly in that as you know.
Yeah. (Noticing this makes him out to be the bad kid, he gets defensive) Well, I couldn't run over there the way I was!
I can't believe this! What was wrong with it? What didn't you like about it?
All these years I've been chuckin' and you've never told me?
And maybe we could go out and do something.
Look at that. They got lobster on the menu. Who would order a lobster here. I mean, do they bring a lobster in everyday hoping *todays* the day.
What happened to the screen door? It blew off again?
You know what this has to do with?
I dont know where the nurse is. Sweetheart why dont you get a nurse for mommy?  Anyway I was just curious. Remember the other day you were saying something about my trip.
Well, you know, It's interesting, you know, under that pressure, what you're capable of.
All right, I'll tell you what... why don't you go into the store and I'll wait in the car?
(Thinking to himself) She's not concerned about the security guard. What kind of a person is this? I'm marrying a person who doesn't care that this man has to stand here 8 hours a day when he could easily be sitting.
Why? Because we're a team! C'mon! Would you take this for us, dear? Thank you very much. Here we go... (To Morgan) Anyone ever tell you you look a lot like Sugar Ray Leonard? Yeah, you must get that all the time.
I like Christian rock. It's very positive. It's not like those real musicians who think they're so cool and hip.
Jerry, it's me, George, don't worry, I'll return it tomorrow, no problem.
Elaine, get off the speaker! (Elaine picks up phone)
Well, I shouldn't have to pay for it!
(puts down handset) Because he'll know I told you. Besides, he's giving me a parking spot around the corner for practically nothing.
Well, you know, I was thinking about what you said before, and...you're right, I've never really been a couple, so...if that's the rule, then I'm gonna go by the rule.
look at this guy. Does he have to stretch in here?
Now my parents are gonna know I had people over.
Oh, boy I was up to four in the morning watching the Omen trilogy.
Jerry! Oh, my God! What are you doing!?!
I don't know if you're ready for it.
(disbelief) What? (laugh) Wh... what're you talking about? I'm not the one with the problem. (defensive) Lloyd Braun was in the nuthouse, not me.
I know Jerry. He has this phobia about public toilets. I think we really should go upstairs.
Yeah. There's something wrong with that? I'm a character. People are always saying to me, "You know you're a quite a character."
I told you to stop with the hopping.
I like this area. I could live out here.
I still don't see why you wouldn't eat me. I'm your best friend.
(con't) All right, you know she's got that laugh. What did you say? It's like Elmer Fudd sitting on a juicer?
(cuts into Jerry talking) Chocolate chip mint? Oh well, actually Jerry I prefer chocolate chip. What is it about the chocolate and the mint that makes it go so well together?
(Annoyed) Yeah, yeah. We'll, uh, let you know.
Oh they'll get out of the way. You really smell banana?
I offered to pay. She should've said no.
You know, Jason, I, uh, I couldn't help notice, I... I didn't get my apology.
Yes, well, you know, Im not thinking about the price. You know youre the only woman Ive never thought about the price. Get the lobster. I beg you to get the lobster. Go for the lobster.
Really? (Jerry nods his head) Well, what if it doesnt stop? Oh, that I really needed to hear. That helps a lot! All right, just say something. Just start talking. Change the subject. Lets just go, All right? I cant believe were having dinner with Alton Benes.
Say you, me, and Kramer are, uh, flying over the Andes.
I'm afraid I'm just not interested in how I present myself. If those kind of superficialities are important to you, this probably isn't gonna work.
She made a big breakfast every Sunday. I don't know what she put in those eggs.
Can you believe it? It's happening! It's finally happening! I'm free!!
And this is the first you're seeing of the coat?
Well, it's less than twenty-four hours, so I guess I have to!
Pardon me, I went to see your friend Dwayne... there was no discount.
Now, this is the basic layout for Mario's Pizza.
(Annoyingly butting in) Kinda like Superman's fortress of solitude.
This good be so sweet, Jerry. Saving lives? She's one step away working at the clinique counter!
So what, he's got a couple of good jokes.
Its amazing. We, we both have dates on the same night. I cant remember the last time that happened.
You know what? It doesn't matter, because I quit!
(pause) Alright if you think it's too much they don't have to mail the postcards.
Awright, lemme just say this. Ten thousand dollars, alright, and now I'm going below what you wanted to pay. You have your dinner, have your veal, or whatever it is. Enjoy...
(Snaps, then points to the coffee table) Hand me an Emory board.
Id like to have a kid. Of course, you have to have a date first... Remember my friend, Adam, from Detroit?
Where are we going? Why are we pulling off here?
Well, anything I can do to help, um...she's a wonderful girl. Very smart. Very eh...crafty.
Oh, no. No. No. No. No. Nothing. I'm fine. Everything's fine. Fine. Just get a little nervous on the weekends, that's all. Could I, uh, could I get a glass of water?
(Sheepishly to Elaine) I'll be right back. (Leaves)
No...Why should that make any difference to you?
Sure, dudes in this town are dime a dozen.
No, no, she might just think its a gift.
Rid? Nah, c'mon, the word is 'care'. Care. I care about your comfort, be it here in Queens or twelve-hundred miles away.
Mister Seinfeld? What about Mister Costanza? I'm not here?
Jerry please, that's very nice, but, uh, (closes the door) where would we be going?
Listen Jerry. With all due respect, Bania's voice is the voice of a new generation. My generation.
Hey, hey, hey! You don't call me back?!
If you go now, I know what's gonna happen. We'll find the car, Jerry will show up, and then we'll never find you.
No. No. No. No. No. Don't worry. It's perfectly safe. I researched it. He'll get a little woozy. He might keel over.
What do you mean not goin'? Come on, we got plans here. Call her up.
(Yelling out) It's my apartment, Eldridge! The Stalkholm may not have sunk ya, but I will! Ha, ha, ha!
You would think that at the end of the week when they hand out the checks, throw in a few soaps.
(shouting) Turn your key, Maura. Turn your key!
Yes! (both laugh) God, I've never felt so alive!
So I set up a screening, everyone takes their shirt off and click, I snap me a shot of a bear-chested Kruger.
I'm against all "it's me"s. So self-absorbed and egotistical, it's like those hip musicians with their complicated shoes!
I know what I'm doin'. In fact Mr. Wilhelm gave me one of those little stress dolls. All right. (gets up) Back to work. (acts annoyed and leaves)
Maybe I could move them until you get back.
Mister Fowler, I-I have a squirrel here that is a miracle of modern science! (laughs)
Yes! Because it is the mature, adult thing to do.
Yeah, but if you still look closely you can see ah, a little bump where the nose use to be. huhuhuhu.
(grabbing the sweater back) Well it's not really damaged. 85 dollars huh?
I just remembered, I gotta be someplace. Yuh-hu-hur, that's enough. Pop. Pop, put down the wrench, Pop.
(to Jerry, as Jerry nods in agreement) You know I think she might have something there.
Youre doomed. Youre gonna have to have all your sex at womens apartments. Itll be like a permanent road trip. Forget about the home bed advantage.
I wasn't going to say anything, but then I could see that he wasn't going to open his mouth. (Chuckles)
All day. ( phone rings , Jerry picks up)
Don't worry, we'll find something for you. (Knock of Jerry's door)
Right, can we go? Cause Im double-parked, Im gonna get a ticket.
I don't know. A little thing called Step Nine? Instead of an apology, he was beboppin' and scattin' all over me.
All right, I gotta make a call. Everybody out, come on.
Oh, well th-that's great. It's really great. Hm hm mm.
I DON'T KNOW. It's this place. I'm very uncomfortable here.
(sitting) Newww tuxedo. For the Pinstripe Ball. Steinbrenner is throwing a huge party at Tavern on the Green, heh!
Do you think it would be better if I did?
Oh, I think so, and I can prove it. You see, I was doodling on the bill and uh, so if you have a twenty in there with big lips on it... well, (smiles) that's mine. Would you mind opening up the register?
So they're flying the tiny instruments in from El Paso.
Oh, no no no. Course not. I got a great name for our kids. A real original. You wanna hear what it is? Huh, you ready?
(Rubbing his stomach) Ooh.. Something's not sitting right..
If I didnt put that floss in my pocket, Id be crawling around her bedroom right now looking for my glasses.
All right, forget that idea, it's not for you....Okay, okay, I got it. You run an antique store.
Well I think it would be nice if there was some kind of historical record of it.
Uh, Jerry, you want your blankets tucked in?
(after hesitating, resignedly) All right. (He sits down and smiles unconvincingly at her)
Now Im in the worst position of all.
(broaching a subject) Hey mom. What kind of woman was grandma?
Alright, how's this? We wait till we get to your street corner, we see Elaine and Kramer then we get out. They can't shoot us in the city.
Unless she goes for the bathroom. Thats my only chance. (George crumbles. He drops the cassette on the table.) Who am I kidding? I cant do this, I cant do this. I dont even know how to work those stupid machines.
Well, uhm, I think I'd like to do it.
(In a really strange way) Good, good, do that.
(sitting) So, guess where Mr 'Ocean phoned' turned up? He's working for Firestone, in Akron, Ohio.
She's leaving me dirty messages on my answering machine.
Hey, did I tell you I called one of those girls from the personal ads in The Daily Worker?
Well if you didn't think I was parking, why did you put it in head first?
Oh I got it. (TO JERRY) That I'm supposed to remember. Where the car is, that's insignificant.
Ah, would you take this picture away from me. Take it away and get it outta here. Let me just sign this and go.
Oh, well, a mantel's a whole different story.
She doesn't like. Here is your blue one, it's her favorite. (Takes sweater out of his bag.)
I know, swan dives from twenty floors up, lands right on top. What do I got a bulls eye up there? He couldn't move over two feet? Land on the sidewalk. It's city property.
I saw "Titanic". So that old woman, she's just a liar, right?
(quietly) That's uh, for the two of us.
Tennis courts? W-w-what about the yard? Where do they have the gang fights?
Uh, excuse me. (stopping them from rehearsing) Excuse me. (he walks to the guy's in charge of yelling "take #!") This--This is not right. May I? (the guy looks at George with a bothered face. George then walks up to Tom and takes him away from Jerry and Michael to talk to him in private)(to Tom) You see, you're going "They fooled *me* Jerry!" (George shakes his head with disapproval) You wanna hit 'fooled' more "They *fooled* me Jerry!". You see the difference?
Ahh, Steinbrenner gave 'em to us, in honour of Phil Rizzuto being inducted into the Hall of Fame.
She didn't want to come, she-she's not really into sports.
(angry that she believes Al was right) No he's not right. Al Netchie is not right! Alright I'm canceling the father-son picnic. I don't know what he's gonna do with all that potato salad.
Ho ho. This bizarre ?harrod? experiment must end!
Who doesn't like cashmere? Find me one person in the world that doesn't like cashmere. It's too expensive.
Thats exquisite. Listen, uh, if its not too much trouble, could you pass me that paper over there?
'The lights are much brighter there. You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares, just go...'
She called my office. She said shes been in the Hamptons since Sunday. She didnt know if I was trying to get in touch with her. Her machine broke, and shes been using her old machine and she doesnt have the beeper for it.
Yes. With a little guidance, Steven Koren is going to be everything I claim to be, only for real. That's my dream, Jerry.
Jerry, for all I know this guy went out of his way to not invite you. How am I gonna feel if I show up with an uninvited, unwelcome intruder?
Yeah, yeah. Well, I guess I started losing it when I was about twenty-eight right around the time I made my first million. You know what they say. The first million is the hardest one.
She stole twenty dollars from me. (getting angry) Yeah, I might've gotten it back, but Lloyd Braun interfered!
(To his girlfriend) Nina, you have to decide right now. Jerry or me?
All he has to do now is count his blessings, say a prayer, and he's done. Do you believe this?
I dont know what the hell I said. I gave her an ultimatum and theres nothing I can do. Its a machine. The little light is blinking right now, Come and listen to the idiot. Hey everybody, the idiots on!
I have to say, as a glasses wearer I take exception to that. That's like me buying a wheelchair to cruise around in.
Not that much. You know, they tend to shrink in the water.
No, not nervous. I'm good, very good. (A beat, then he snaps) I can't do this! Can't do this!
So she doesn't want to see me anymore.
Hi! Mr. West, this is my friend Elaine--
Well I was lost, I never saw the first one. By the way, you mind if I watch it here?
Are you crazy? This is like discovering Plutonium ... by accident.
But Mr. Cantwell, you... you owe me for the soup...
Did you explain to her about the good naked and the bad naked?
[trying to act as if he doesn't care one way or the other, but we know better] Either way.
Oh ya, like there's something wrong with saying 'God bless you'. I was raised to say 'God bless you'.
Let's go, people, let's go! It's Prognosis Negative time, wa ha ha ha!!!
You know, it was really wrong of you to back out on that deal.
Her scalp was clean. She had a nice skull. There just wasn't a lot of hair on it.
(handing over a bill) Can I get a pack of gum, please?
Yeah. Yeah. With all that kissing and the shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy out in public like that. It's disgusting!
Huh, really? How bad? Was he on his death bed?
Anyway, as I was lying in the puddle, I-I think I may have found a way for us to get Bonds and Griffey, and we wouldn't have to give up that much.
I used to share that same outlook. But now, I have so many things to occupy my mind. For instance, the atom.
(through a mouthful) Long as they don't throw 'em on the field. (laughs) Huhu. (indicating dish) Help yourself to some shrimp, I brought enough for everybody.
Oh right, right! The blue sweatpants! Gees, it's too bad you can't say anything because of Angela.
I dont want to get out of it.
(whistles disapprovingly) Ho ho ho, Had to? Had to come in?
Oh, please. (to the teller) Can you change this into bills?
There was nothing else on. Oh, the left arm.. the left arm.
Oh, I, uh, I disagree. You've, uh, you've been living in America too long. (indicates the bag of oranges) You've forgotten what it's like to have no oranges.
WAIT ,WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!!!!.... Where was the tape recorder?
What about your old car? They couldn't get Kramer's blood out of it?
Nah, nah, it's uh, it's a long story. Just uh, try to get it up.
I told her I would have to think about it.
Oh my God. I just remembered where I left my retainer in second grade. I'll see ya. (He throws finished Rubik's cube to Jerry and he exits. Kramer enters)
I thought he was just gonna have a muffin.
What do you mean Wednesday? I though we had tickets to the Knick game Wednesday. We got seats behind the bench! What happened? Were not going?
(looking at his watch) I really should get going. Y'know, I..I wanna be home in case Neil calls.
Well, that pear shaped loser was me! And I was in that photo, until I broke in here, stole the photograph and airbrushed myself out of there!
Alright, just make sure he reserves the good chair for me. Wait, what are you gonna tell him about the clanking noise in the car?
You know, like all the comedians always say, 'How would you like it if I came to where you work and heckled you?'
It's like a magic trick. Sometimes I think it would be easier to bend a spoon mentally than to make that transformation.
??? KNOCK OFFS. I NOT GOING TO DO IT! AND YOU'RE GOING TO CALL STEINBRENNER BACK AND CANCEL THE WHOLE THING.
No, I can't. What if I meet a woman? I'd always be worried about that first moment where I'd take it off and see that look of disappointment on her face.
(he drops a paper airplane he was holding) Mr. Wilhelm!
(standing) Yes, payroll. Yes I did. Very productive. Payroll... Paid off.
We just go up to him, we say, "We're O'Brien."
Handicap? (gesturing to his cane) Oh, I'm not handicapped.
All right, I gotta get going. My parents are expecting me.
(on the answering machine) Jerry, it's George. Hey, hey are you all set for the weekend. This is going to be great. You're going to have a great time with Naomi.
Well, you never know. (picks up more shrimp) Let's see how many I can fit in my mouth.
Yeeeaaah. (Jerry and George lean in to make their conversation a little more private) Well..... I've never really felt confident in uh..... one particular aspect.
My censor quit two years ago. He checked into a clinic. Emotionally exhausted.
Ah hah. You see Father, Im Im incredibly anxious to become a member. Um, dont you offer any kind of an express conversion? A quick change?
Youre a fine person. Youre a humanitarian. Shes very sexy.
Well, they hurt him bad. Really hurt his feelings. It's a long story. I- I don't like to talk about it, but I swore then that I would never work for big broker-houses. See, all they care about is money. I'm about more than money, I'm about people, always gone my own way and I've never looked back.
All right. Okay, tell me what you think about this idea Extend the doors on the toilet stalls at Yankee Stadium all the way to the floor.
Robin, listen to me. The most amazing thing has happened. Kramer has opened my eyes. I think I've changed.
All right, Dad, we're five blocks from the house. Sit sideways.
Well, I don't see why if you have his, he should have yours.
Oh...uh, because if it had anything at all to do with what you perceived as me leering at your daughter, I really have to take issue with that. I did not leer. (To Jerry) Did I leer?
It became very clear to me sitting out there today, that every decision I've ever made, in my entire life, has been wrong. My life is the complete opposite of everything I want it to be. Every instinct I have, in every of aspect of life, be it something to wear, something to eat ... It's all been wrong. (chuckles) Everywhere.
(on an imaginary microphone) Uh, no, not at this time.
(panicky) What are you gonna do? Are you gonna call the police?
Hi, I was just uh... I just had one little question about uh, my assignment.
Yeah, it's being framed right now. I don't even know what it costs. (beat) Not, uh, too expensive, is it?
It's stuck on a piece of cloth here. I can't get the cloth out.
Well, it always has to be explained to me, and then I have to have someone explain the explanation.
Yes, yes, I definitely waited. But let me say this Once he passes on that option, that 'God bless you' is up for grabs.
It would have been nice if someone told me about it. I just think you could have said something. That's all.
But you didn't use a coaster, Jerry, you left a stain! (he runs to kitchen)
(getting animated) Yeah. Yeah. You know the odds of me being anyone's type?! I have never been anyone's type, but apparently, this Marisa Tomei loves funny, quirky, bald men.
No, I can't. She knows I go there. It's not secure. (the call waiting beeps) Hey, I got another call comin' in. I gotta let the machine get it. Bye. (hangs up)
So what? Somebody dropped an egg on my head as I went into my building last night.
There's a bag of Pepperidge Farm cookies up there.
I mean, batteries have gone dead before, aren't they prepared for that?
Oh, thats great. Thats great. By the way I have to apologize for my friend the other day. Friend? Uh, uh I dont even know that woman. I met her on the bus on the way over. I couldnt get rid of her. Uh, My psychic instincts were a little off ..
Well Dad's been planning this for such a long time, he bought a new blanket, and he got tha...that game with foam paddles and the velcro ball. (laughs)
Ah, listen ah, I don't mean to bother you but ah, silly me, I- I think I may have left my hat in your apartment. So ah, I thought I'd just come by later and pick it up.
Thanks. You know this could sound crazy but, what do you think about adding a drawer for - like a blanket?
Give me two bucks. Ill do it for two bucks.
I did it. Hunh, we're going out as soon as she gets off of work and it'll still be daytime. You know I, Im much better in the daytime then I am at night. it's less pressure.
Uh, I just went out, I went to look for my friend?
(shouting) How d'you not like Soda?! It's bubbly, it's refreshing!
Whoa, whoa, you're not getting in my car with gummy shoes.
All right, Puddy, listen, and listen good I need to know the name of that mechanic that walks around here. Big guy, a liar. Short name. Sam? Moe? Sol?!
What am I supposed to get, a bazooka?
The guy who pitched him the show with the stories about nothing. (snaps fingers) Jerry Seinfeld. Jerry Seinfeld's friend.
(Reflecting on his life gone wrong) This McKigney guy had a few good years.. (To Kramer, bitter) How could you forget to turn off an iron?
Yeah, You remember the, the little eh, bank book, there?
It's a very complicated move! I couldn't remember it all.
Oh, I understand. (George exits; Sees Kramer in the hallway) Hey.
Well... what if you showed up bad naked, huh? You still got that belt sander?
We'll ask him. (opens partition) My dear fellow, where are you dropping us?
So... uh you feel okay about that whole thing... what we do in there... you're generally okay with everything in there?
Hi. I-I really should be getting back to my fianc, you know, we, uh, we had this big fight yesterday and, uh, well she, she wants to-to know my secret code. I-I don't know, I can't tell her. The funny thing is, you know, I would really love to tell someone 'cause it's killing me. You uh, you wanna know what it is? It's Bosco. You know, the chocolate syrup? I love that stuff, I pour it in milk, it's my favorite drink. Hoo-hoo, boy, that is a relief!
I don't know how you can let this guy handle all your money.
You've still got pretty good coverage. Once the enemy advances beyond this perimeter - (points at Kurt's head with a pen) - then you won't be Kurt anymore.
(Showing Jerry up) Listen carefully. My mother has never laughed. Ever. Not a giggle, not a chuckle, not a tee-hee.. never went 'Ha!'
Hey could you do one other thing for me?
Alright! So, she said, that she could've fixed me up with her.
(Panicky) Uh, yeah. You know, Doctor, I gotta tell you, I feel a lot better.
Well, wait a little while, Ma. What's the difference?
" I'll always be a winner and you'll always be a loser." This is what he said to me.
(Putting his jacket on) I'd like to apologize. I want to tell him I.. I.. didn't mean to get him in trouble.
Hey, they can't go, "Hey! You look fabulous!"
(Looking over the writing materials they just bought) Bics? What, d'ja get, bics?
It wasn't down in, it was sort of on top.
(confessing) Well, actually, I thought it up on the way over here.
I feel like I'm in bed with my mother.
Are you kidding? People get spaces this good, they never give em up.
Oh ah, I uh, will have that for you by after lunch.
A little notice would've helped! How many people?
I know. I can tell. It's one of my powers. Why, did you ever fake?
Madam? What are you calling me madam for?
I'm sure we're all aware of the flaws and biases of standardized tests..
(Makes a gesture saying he understands. The man nods) But how.. uh..?
Yeah. (Points to two open seats in front of Jerry's. To Nina) Sit down there. (Sees Jerry in the crowd) Hello, Jerry. (Obviously angered at Jerry) I believe you know Nina.
Then of course with evolution, the octopus lost the nostrils and took on the more familiar look that we know today.
I'll tell you what's wrong, a grown woman with a male roommate! It's unnatural, it's an abomination!
I gave her a twenty, she only gave me change for a ten.
It's this way... AND THEY TAKE OFF AGAIN, PAIRING OFF
Well this is bad. I am really in a bad situation now.
I just feel terrible This is just terrible.
Oh that's OK, really, don't worry about it.
The man in the cape--I bet you he is mixed up in this! I don't trust men in capes.
(George is telling a story. Karen is laughing and she seems to be the only one to find him funny) So I go into this clothing store and the saleswoman is wearing this (whistling) low cut thing. So I said to her "Can I ask you a question? When you put on a top like that, what's your tought process? What's going on in your mind?"
No. She tried to give me the "it's not you, it's me" routine.
Yeah, is he still mad at you for crashing his Thanksgiving party?
Oh, gotta get fifty. Gotta get fifty. All right, I tell you what. We go to the coffee shop, you call your manager. Maybe they made an offer.
"There's a lot of money in this.. He's got a proven sales method"
You know, my mother used to walk around on our apartment just in her bra and panties. She didn't look anything like you, she was really disgusting, really bad body. If you could imagine uglier and fatter version of Shirley Booth. Remember Shirley Booth from Hazel. Really embarrassing, cause you know I had only mother in the whole neighborhood who was worse looking than Hazel. Imagine the taunts I would hear.
I need higher. This has paba in it, I need paba-free.
Yeah, let him chew on that for a while.
I know who it was too. It was the guy who interviewed me. He was very threatened by me. Why else wouldn't he hire me? I could sell latex like that (snaps fingers).
You are a good friend. You know what? Even if you killed somebody I wouldn't turn you in.
How come youre not doin the second show tomorrow?
Still lookin'. It's pretty bad out there. What about you?
I was all primed for the first row; I was gonna put my feet up on the dugout!
So is it all over between you and... Marsha Mason?
(cheerful) Alright, there you go. She's gonna get the jacket back. (claps hands) So, let's go get some coffee, huh?
(singing; imitating Tony Bennett) You know, Id go from nods to nothing...
Right. He cooks my food, he cleans my house, he does all my shopping for me. And there you go, that's your program.
(Changing subject) Hey, I htink I may have found someone for the scholarship.
Ah! Some bald thing, a bald thing I dunno. It's nothing
I think I like the girl better than the voice.
(gasping) I think I swallowed a fly! I swallowed a fly! What do I do? (He turns to a coffee shop patron at the counter.) What can happen?!
You're an alcoholic! You have to apologize. Step Nine! Step Nine.
Well, I still don't know what I'm supposed to do. I don't even know what my assignment is.
What do you mean you will? That's a bad idea. Jerry is a very private person.
You know, it's very impolite to tell secrets. Are you talking about me?
The uniforms! Did you see how they played? Listen to these comments! (reads from the paper) "Wade Boggs 'What a fabric! Finally we can breathe.' Luis Palonia 'Cotton is king.' Paul O'Neill 'I never dreamed anything could be so soft and fluffy.' "
(Angry) Yeah, that's what they told me the last time.
The next morning, I woke up, and it was going like this. (moves his arm slowly) I can control it if I really concentrate. But otherwise, (arm moves) oh.
My place? NO, no, no. I hate my place. I don't wanna go back to my place.
Wa, I'm not getting out of this cab
Ahh! (closes his eyes and rolling his head back) Umh!
That's right! He never apologized to me for saying that I would stretch out the neck hole of his sweater.
That's not how it happened. It's when he fell on him with his knee.
(checking the fridge) No Chinese leftovers. George is gettin' suspicious.
Well I can't now, Gwen's going to be there.
Great move, telling him, by the way, real smart move.
Excuse me Ms. which street are we on?
What about the body, what kind of body?
Did you see the way she pointed at the check? She gave me the finger.
A few days go by and a call is placed at a time when Sandy is known to be busy at work. Once the initial awkwardness is relieved with a little playful humor, which she [Laura] of course cannot resist, an invitation to a friendly dinner is proffered.
Oh, of course. (motioning Estelle to enter) Of course.
Excuse me, are you gonna be very long?
Don't you understand? It's not about him. To have a line as perfect as 'jerk store' and to never use it. I, I couldn't live with myself.
She cant even afford to go out to lunch. She's been eating in a high school cafeterias She pretends to be a teacher. It's pathetic.
How would you like a 'Hare Krishna' fist on your throat, you little punk?
Alrighty. Ah ... my last job was in publishing ... I uh got fired for having sex in my office with the cleaning woman.
I'm family. I'm having sex with the cousin!
What happens if the husband dies after the wife, who brings in the clothing in then?
I think he was trying to tell me something, like it had some sort of a meaning.
Well, I think you're wrong about that. [Elaine walks past the window again, glancing in] And ah now if you'll excuse me, I'd really like to get started, please.
I-I'm already here. I'm here. I'm here. Uh, you know what? If you want a computer, call me. I-I gotta go.
Well, it wouldn't fit you. The sleeves are too short.
So what do you want me to do?
Yes. She's got great skin - a rosy glow..
Oy uy uy.. (Antonio points to the sink) We really should get going.
Oh, my god that's Saddam Hussein. The dictator.
Sir, I'm sure it's not a police matter.
Well the sex was okay, but I threw up from the Hennigans.
Well, last night she told me that she liked you. Not you, the disturbed you, so I had to tell her the truth.
No, no. I-I just want us to be... together.
What are you gonna do with all of them?
Don't jinx it! Don't jinx (trails off quietly in elation)
(adamant) It's not cheating if there's no sex!
Behind the dugout, are you kidding? How did you get them?
Uh, uh, yeah. Actually, the, uh, I-I bumped my elbow on a desk and uh injured something an.. now it sort of moves involuntarily.
Because before you know it he'll be having lunch with him. You know how these interoffice politics work.
I'm not crying. And I shouldn't have said that about your wife. Please accept my apologies.
That's... what we used to call him in high school, the exterminator. He's a linebacker. Oh, did we have some wild times.
We gotta get something. I don't want to go to that meeting on an empty stomach. Let's get some Chinese. You wanna order it?
One of your guys - Kip, or Ned, short name - stole my Twix candy bar!
Why can't I have a heart attack? I'm allowed.
I told her. In the kitchen  which was risky cause its near all the knives. I started with the word Listen.
(upset) Well, you've scared her off. We may never see mom again.
Speak now, or we are headed to the Hamptons. It's a two-hour drive. Once you get in that car, we are going all the way... to the Hamptons. All right, you wanna get nuts? Come on. Let's get nuts!
(Hangs up phone and pauses) this is great! He fired her! This is incredible, he fired her. I'm out, baby! I'm out!
Dad, it's me. Hey, listen, I was at Fortunoff's the other day, and, you know what, you were right.
(turning to each other) I dont know. Hes an importer.
My presence, in that office, can only hurt my chances.
So you - you really don't have my hat?
I know it's a doll, but it looks like my mother!
He's getting on a bus, damn! (To the blind man) Those are nice glasses.
I don't even think she'd notice it. Can you see it?
I think I got it. How 'bout this? How 'bout this? We trade Jim Leyritz and Bernie Williams, for Barry Bonds, huh? Whadda ya think? That way I have Griffey and Bonds, in the same outfield! Now you got a team! Ha ha ha.
You are gonna love this car. Even if you don't like Jon Voight.
(waving) How can I not think about it? Look at the size of this thing.
Yeah my parents have it. Sometimes it skips a generation.
Well, here you go. What do you think?
(wondering) Maybe he doesn't. Maybe he and I are exactly the same, except for one minor, yet crucial, detail. You never know.
You know I'm enjoying it very much. I think my coworkers are really taking to me.
He wants to meet you? I'll tell you what. I'll show up. He doesn't know we're friends. I'll pretend I haven't seen you since High School. I'll back up the story.
Yes, well you see, the deceased landed on my car. The uh splat, as it were, actually occurred on the roof of my car. Now of course I can't help but feel that had it been a convertible this whole tragedy might have been averted but I've never been the kind of guy to buy a convertible, what with the baldness and everything.
YES! It Blows Up! If you knew that, what did you tell Elaine for?
Hey, yeah. My parents want to come too, is that ok?
Well, they gave birth to me, and, yada yada...
That's where the Seinfeld's are moving. They got a great deal. Yep. You know what they got in Florida? Jai-Alai! You bet on the games, you clean up.
I can't believe I didn't push for this sooner.
(still quiet) Never mind, never mind. I need you to do me a favour. Uhm, remember what we were talking about at the coffee shop earlier?
Well, you're gonna have to go to the bathroom!
Wait a minute, wait a minute. You can't say anything. (rushes to take phone from Jerry)
(suspicious) They haven't said anything to you, have they?
I take an eye test; I flunk it, the next thing you know I am swinging to the sweet sounds of risk management.
Oh yes, by no means, the mood. Let me know if there's anything I can do to lend support to the mood.
Oh, nothing much. You know, I went over to Jerry's. Talked to Jerry. Um, could I talk to you for a minute?
Look at these salesmen. The only thing these guys fear is the walk-out. No matter what they say, you say, "Ill walk out of here right now!"
You don't understand, there's a *blurb* about me in this magazine!
ahhhhh (exhaling) Jerry, my young friend, you're so nave. You are so, so nave. You know about a few things. You know about comedy, a little bit about relationships, some baseball, but you are so far out of your element here, you are embarrassing yourself. Now listen to me. I'm negotiating. Negotiation, this is what'cha do in business.
Well, Dr, Allenwood, uh...I was hoping to compile an - admittedly, rudimentary - scrapbook of her life. Something that Betsy could have, and hold onto.
Well, it's just a game. Remember that, kids.
Jerry, let's face it, I've always been handicapped. I'm just now getting the recognition for it. Name one thing I have that puts me in a position of advantage. Huh? There was a guy that worked at the Yankees-- no arms! He got more work done than I did, made more money, had a wife, a family, drove a better car than I did.
I got a message from the Rosses at work today.
Jerry, come on. If my mother keeps shrinking, this is exactly what she's gonna look like in ten years!
I've seen squeeze mustard. I've never seen squeeze ketchup.
Yeah, sure. I was showing a condo on 48th street. Besides, you think I wanna miss this? (chuckles)
Let's say it comes down to me and one other guy. He's got a nice quiet suit, and I'm whooshing all over the place! Who do you think he's gonna hire?
(opening door) It's a big night. I'm, uh, ice skating with one, and going to a staged reading of "Godspell" with the other.
Dad, you really should lay off the 'serenity now' stuff.
(Trying to keep it down) Because I like this one! (Notices people staring at him, he quickly gets up, collecting the his coat and the tiny replica) C'mon, let's go. Let's go! (On his way out, he stops in front of a woman blocking his path) Oh, hi.. (Embarrassed about the doll, he sheepishly walks out)
Alright. Listen, I gotta get some reading done. You mind if I do this here? I can't concentrate in my apartment.
The story is the foundation of all entertainment. You must have a good story otherwise it's just masturbation.
(nervous) All right now we're going bye bye.
Time like what? I'm hungry. My stomach doesn't know that Kramer's wanted.
What are we gonna do? How are we gonna get out of here?
An' wait'll you see the dress that she's got. It's backless! Uh?! I'm finally gonna make a Great Entrance!
What's he going to do? That's exactly the point. Nobody knows what this guy is capable of! He fires people like it is a bodily function.
(to phone) Hi, Allison? Oh, I guess you're not at home.. I probably should 'ave tried you at the office. Anyway, good to hear from ya, really looking forward to the ball.. (hangs up and happily chuckles) Ha ha!
Right. So I call her up, I tell her its me, she gives me an enthusiastic Hi!
Oh. This I need. Hello!! Hello. i..i..is this the hair restoration clinic? ...Does anyone speak English?
Hey, Jerry, what was the name of the exterminator who fumigated your apartment when you had fleas?
Oh, see? that's why I don't have cable in my house. Because of that naked station. If I had that in my house, I would never turn it off. I wouldn't sleep, I wouldn't eat. Eventually, firemen would have to break through the door, they'd find me sitting there in my pajamas with drool coming down my face. All right, all right. So you're watching the naked station.
That was a hell of a thing when Spock died...
Well, how good a look did you get?
Oh, very refreshing. (Thinking again) Sex is like joining a private club. I'll be the same me tomorrow, but suddenly, the no trespassing sign will be gone.
Hey, hey hey. Don't worry about me. I'm not a waffler. I don't waffle!
Lloyd Braun? What d'you have to meet him for?
And you met her in an antique store! I don't know how you do it!
No, listen; we are always sitting here, I am always helping you with your girl problems and you are helping me with my girl problems. Where do we end up?
So, I'm gonna steal another one, and then return it. That way, everything is even.
What? No dibs! I need this statue. Cmon, give it!
(clears his throat) Im, uh, Im an architect.
Man, would I like to see the look on his face.
Not necessarily. Mustard lends itself to the squeeze.
I gotta go zoo. I feel like I could set more of my own schedule.
It's all worked out. Nina and I will have dinner Thursday at the restaurant where Babs works.
(afraid not) No no, no no no. You're not goin' in there.
Anyway, we met with NBC about a month ago and they gave us the green light to go ahead and write a pilot. In fact, we got a big meeting with them tomorrow. They gotta approve of the story before we can write.
What do you think I mean bald? Bald. Bald bald.
You are aware that Pensky is interested in me.
You can stuff your sorries in a sack, mister!
Y'know... I could hear you on the other line...
I suppose he could swivel. Hey maybe one of those director's chairs. What do you think of those.
I don't think we should see each other anymore. You're great but I'm I'm riddled with personal problems.
They could kick me out of the health club if he tells them!
I can't eat this without catsup. Would it kill her to check up on us? Would that be a terrible thing? "How's everything? Do you need anything? What can I do for you?"
No, not nice. She's stickin' it to me.
(grabbing his jacket) Hey oo, I just remembered uh my parents really wanna have you guys over for dinner before you leave town. What about tonight?
Hey Deena, come on, give us a hug. (they hug) Oh my gosh, you look as pretty as you did back in high school.
So, he's keeping the apartment. He doesn't deserve it, though! Even if he did suffer, that was, like, 40 years ago! What has he been doing lately?! I've been suffering for the past 30 years up to and including yesterday!
Hey, is it my imagination, or do really good looking women walk a lot faster than everybody else?
(opening door to leave) He picked her up?
Look I need you to do me a favor. I need you to get me lunch at Pisano's.
Yeah, well I'm thinking about getting out of town with Susan for a few days....Her parents rebuilt the cabin!
Uh, let me ask you a question. Could you, uh, expand the space underneath a desk to give it a little more headroom?
Well, of course they're trying to screw you. What do you think? That's what they do. They can make up anything. Nobody knows. "By the way, you need a new Johnson rod in there." "Oh, a Johnson rod. Yeah, well, you better put one of those on."
(Getting in a more panicked state) Oh God, Mommy!
Hey, did you know that the Yankees don't wear cotton jerseys?
No. No it's not. You don't know this guy. It woulda been so sweet.
Is that so? Or could it be that you're just a *little* bit worried that you may have missed the boat?
Jerry, I'm trapped under my desk. Steinbrenner is in the room. You got to help[ me.
Babu Bhatt? How I'm going to explain this?
All right. Let's go over it again, one more time.
Kramer, trust me, this is the best bathroom in midtown!
But your life is Peterman's. Now the bus tour, which is real, takes to places that, while they are real, they are not real in sense that they did not *really* happen to the *real* Peterman which is you.
That's why I peeked. (Jerry opens the door to take some trash out, and meets Kramer and Gail in the hallway.)
Don't you see what it says here? Don't you understand what that's implying?
I dunno, Jerry somethin's missing. There's a void, Jerry, there's a void...
Im aware of you. (to Jerry) All right, lets go (opens the bathroom door) Lets go!
Yeah, this is my first time here. (nudges Jerry again)
I mean, she's beautiful, right? She's just my type. The dark hair, the full lips.
This is fantastic. Man, what a weekend. Swimming, lobster for dinner...
Y'know if the guy dies, the art could really be worth something...
Whatever. Listen, I'm very concerned about this guy.
I don't think we should. We really don't know each other very well.
If youre a spirit, and you can travel to other dimensions and galaxies, and find out the mysteries of the universe, you think shes gonna wanna hang around Drexlers funeral home on Ocean Parkway?
What? Elaine's big-head guy? They have you the apartment?!
Lo..k, if you want to taste mine, you don't have to offer me some of yours.
Yeah, well, I guess the only thing I can do is go into George Steinbrenners office and tell him he has to give her a raise.
Miss Rhode Island? When are you seeing her?
U-ok. (George closes the window and shoos Elaine off. He opens the door to Monica.) Here you go.
Ha, I don't know who she's looking for. I don't know. I'll tell you something. She's very particular, your daughter. Very particular. What is she looking for some big hot shot businessman? Well I've got my pride too. I'm not going to beg her.
I can't believe it. Look, that's Jerry Seinfeld.
I cant. I met them. Theyre devout. You know, in the cab on the way over here, I actually thought about converting.
You know what? I can't do this. I can't read books anymore; books on tape have ruined me, Jerry. I need that nice voice. This book has *my* voice. I hate my voice.
Yes, I know so. You happen to be a very eligible lesbian.
That should be 14, let me just...(corrects it with a pen.)
(fever pitch) Marisa Tomei's sitting home, Elaine! Wh..why didn't you tell me that Katy was friends with Marisa Tomei?!
Let me ask you a question. This new move. Is there a knuckle involved in any way?
(interrupting) You know we should really order, the service is so slow here, by the time you get anything...
I don't know, I don't know, you'll think of something.
You're fresh (grabs her arm) You're very fresh. You seem very fresh to me. You're very vital. I couldn't take you any fresher.
Oh no no no. He's deeply in love, and I was just about to break up with her when she told me.
So, I guess I was lucky that I never tried that myself.
. . .uh, . . . wait a second. Are you suggesting that I went out of my way to tell Elaine that even though you handed her the big salad, that it came from me?
Dad, you know what it takes to compete with Microsoft and IBM?
What, you're gonna take her word over mine? I'm your best friend!
Listen. I want you guys to send along those agreements the minute you land. Our boys can't wait to kick your butts!
I don't know, I have to call her, tell her where we are. I'm very lucky she's even considering seeing me at all.
Yeah, it's bizarre. (they both look around them suspiciously)
Well, that's not offensive. (Reflects) It's abnormal, but it's not offensive.
Reprogram all the buttons, see if he changes them back. You know? The old switcheroo.
Oh yeah yeah, don't you know they used pastrami in that movie 9? weeks? Remember the pastrami scene?
Yo, dad. This is my boss, Mr. Kruger.
Well, I - I could, Uh, I could give the money back. Here. (Holds it out)
Never mind. The're done. All I have to do now is redo them. You know if you take everything I've ever done in my entire life and condense it down into one day, it looks decent.
(slightly worried) You know, I'm starting to get a little nervous about this lunch.
Is that right? I just threw away a lifetime of guilt-free sex, and floor seats for ever sporting event in Madison Square Garden. So please, a little respect. For I am Costanza Lord of the Idiots!
So, Im thinking, as shes saying this, Im thinking great, the relationships over. But the egg salads on the way. So now I have a decision Do I walk or do I eat?
It was a fat camp. Those kids depended on me.
You be nice! He's giving me a parking space (echoes) parking space... parking space...
Oh, sure, my Black Hawks jacket. I love my Black Hawks jacket.
You don't think I can keep a secret?
I have to do this, it's a matter of honor.
Ah, great. All right, with the wine I'm in over twenty dollars now.
I need food, Jerry. I feel faint, I'm getting light headed.
Yeah! That's how they talk. You know, everyone's either a bastard or a son of a bitch. Yeah, it's like uh..."boy, that son of a bitch Box can really hit, uh?!" (laughs)
And people come in the store and you get involved in their lives.
(to the guy next to him) This guy stinks. (speaking of Michael)
I got another meeting with Reilly. A whole new audience, and I bet I can get him to try that line again.
What happened to the pact? We were both gonna change. We shook hands on a pact. Did you not shake my hand on it uh?
Sure, well uh, you know I'll check in with you next week uh, I gotta run now because I got a full plate this afternoon. All right, really go to uh,.
(crying from the onion) You'll see I'm right.
Yeah, you know, what'd she uh, look like?
I don't need any ideas. It's a show about nothing.
(indicating the window) Kramer, it's, it's raining. They got the tarp on the field.
Marisa Tomei! I, just spoke to Marisa Tomei! (sitting opposite Elaine) And I wasn't even that nervous.
Oh yeah. So wait, wait. A half-hour later Im back in the office, I tell Lloyd the whole story. He says, So why dont you call her? I says, I cant. I couldnt, I couldnt do it right then. For me to ask a woman out I gotta get into a mental state like the karate guys before they break the bricks. So Lloyd calls me a wuss.
You paying my hotel and airfare to Miami?
Pamela?! Awright, I tell you what. You look like nice people, I'm gonna help you out. You want a beautiful name? Soda.
You know, suddenly I'm in the mood for pasta primavera myself. (Jerry nudges George to sneak a peek at Molly's cleavage as she bends over and looks in her backpack. Jerry has a quick look, but George stares, hypnotized. Russell comes up behind George.)
That's right. He just happened to be the previous owner of the vehicle.
March 21st. Hey! So, you're gonna back me on this, right?
Hey, what happened with Sandy. I forgot all about it. Did you call her?
That's right, who the hell are they? How dare they?!
You know I still don't know how you can call lunch with me a business expense.
I suppose I could just pull this out ( his tucked shirt)and walk around like this and you wouldn't care?
(Leading Nina out the airport) Oh, no. No. We're good. Let's get goin'. Alright. (Almost bumps into Jerry) Watch it, funny man. (Leaves)
Today. Im going today. Just dont do anything until you hear from me.
Well, you know, I've been lyin' about my income for a few years. I figured I could afford a fake house in the Hamptons.
They're selling coffee, bran muffins.. you're surrounded by reading material. It's entrapment!
(animated) Some guy. Some guy? Neil! I have got to find out how he could get a girl like Danielle.
If we could just harness this power and use it for our own personal gain, there'd be no stopping us.
You would not believe what just happened. I was waiting for you and this woman was sitting at the counter.
Maybe it's some small thing I could change. Like a moustache. Or wearing a top hat, or a monocle, or a..or a cane.
Oh, I just, uh, leased a house out in the Hamptons, and I have got to get out there this weekend and sign the papers.
That's what she says. I say, listen. It was an old cat. It died of natural causes. So get this, now she tells me that I gotta buy her a brand new cat. I say listen, honey. First of all, it was a pretty old cat. I'm not gonna buy you a brand new cat to replace an old dying cat. And second of all, I go out to the garbage, I find you a new cat in fifteen seconds. I say, you show me an autopsy report that says this cat died of starvation, I spring for a new cat. So she says something to me, like, uh, I dunno, get the hell out of here, and she breaks up with me. Now don't you think that would be a great case on L.A. Law?
All right. I am happy, and I'll tell ya why -- because the two of you were making me and every one of your friends sick! Right, Elaine?
Is there any work being done? Is there any rubbing, touching, finger manipulation on the other person, and if so, who's making the request?
(Runs over to him, not wanting him to leave) What? You're going?
Oh, Noooo, I'm so sorry. It's the MOOPS. The correct answer is, The MOOPS.
"Well...there's no room for someone like that in this organization."
See, this should be a show. This is the show.
Bear with you! This is a parking lot PEOPLE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO GET
Oh, come on. What, are you kidding? GEORGE I'm much more comfortable criticizing people behind there backs. Anyway, look who's talking. You just broke up with with Melanie last week because she "shuushed you" while you were watching TV.
Maybe this is what the pilot should be about, vomiting on somebody's vest.
Do you think she gets to take any of those little bars of soap home?
This car out there is taking up, like, three parking spaces.
All right, come on, come on, let's go. Six dollars.
Whoa, look at this. This is a beautiful suit. Huh?
Hey, Buck. Talk to you for a second?
I don't care. Look, Lloyd doesn't know what he's up against. This is nothing to me. (moving his arm) My whole life is a lie.
Wait. Whoa! That's the Rabbi from Elaine's building. I just met this guy the other day.
I don't know, I like stuff you don't have to think about too much.
The perfect combination of Mountain Dew and mozzarella...just the right amount of grease on the joy stick...
Jerry? Yes, I suppose he is white. You know, I never really thought about it. I don't see people in terms of color. You know, there's someone I'd like you to meet. Hand on... (To phone) Is Mr. Morgan in?
Tell you what, I'll make a deal with you. I'll sell it to you right now for ten bucks.
Look, you wanna have sex right now? Do want to have sex with me right now? Let's go! C'mon, let's go baby! C'mon!
He just walked away! And once again I'm standing here like a little man. Well not this time! (George leaves the store and follows the dog owner) You! Dog man!
I'll tell ya, if I had one of these things, I'd be eatin' hot dogs all the time.
(Relieved) I haven't? I'm okay? I'm okay? Oh, thank you, thank you, Doctor! I don't know how to thank you.
You're Murphy!! Look, let's just jump out of the car.
(to salesman) Well, maybe you could show me something else.
Well, if it's as good as ``Ponce de Leon'', I'll be happy.
She comes out of the bathroom, I'm in up to my wrist. You should have seen the look on her face.
It was an inferno in there! An inferno! (Eric, Robin's mother, and all the kids rush at George.)
(sensing his chance) Well, they do now. Neighborhood's changing.
Would I want to see what Mary Todd wore to Lincoln's funeral?
I bent over backwards for that woman! Is it that thing I said about her sister?
(To Estelle) Scissor. (She gets the scissors from the coffee table and hands them to George with the point facing him) Don't hand them to me with the point facing out!
bowling! what do you say bowling? bowling's insane! bowling is crazy time
What are we supposed to do? What do you do on a situation like this? Should we call a lawyer, should we call the police?
Sure. I could go the tomato route. But eh, I've given this a lot of thought Jerry. All that frustration. Ill never get any work done. So Im doing a complete 360. Im going for total efficiency and ability.
I love this place. You know, Carl and I come here all the time.
Alright, alright! (Goes out onto the sidewalk. The Seinfelds walk by) Seinfelds!
This is like a Penthouse letter...Why can't I meet women like this?
But enough about fish, huhuhu. I can discuss other things you know, ah architecture. Huhu. (makes a wide gesture with his arms)
(annoyed) Hes an importer/exporter, okay? (beat) Elaine ever call you back?
So she's just sitting there, she's having a pleasant conversation... and all of a sudden.
Alright. Uh, well, I'm out of here. (Gets up to leave)
Hey, Jerry, remember Frogger? I used to be so into this game. Gettin' that frog across the street was my entire life.
C-Communist? I am a Yankee, sir, first and foremost.
No they don't. I tried that once. I snubbed for a year. Nothing. Every woman I saw, I snubbed. You never saw people so pleased. (Elaine returns from the bathroom.)
(agitated) He's lying, sir! I'm tired of all your macho head games!
Uh, let me ask you something. You uh, you ever hear of Marisa Tomei?
I always get myself in this position. Can't be on time. Gotta rush.
He's coming up?! (Moves to the door) I'll check you out later.
I'll fake an illness. (Acts it out) My back! My back! I can't believe, my back.
Well... (shuts door) heeere we are (puts down his coat and chuckles)
Because I uh, I told her the truth.
Yeah, he's in my bed. I'm sleeping on the couch.
Well at least you accomplished something. You got fish.
(Starting to panic again) What? Oh my God. What? Is it meningitis? Scoliosis? Lupis?! Is it Lupis?!
Well, it worked when I met George Peppard last week.
You know, I could let it go for.. say.. a hundred and twenty-five.
Do you believe this? We're fighting. We're fighting.
Look, I gotta tell ya...I been thinkin' about it, I just don't feel right about letting you into Elaine's apartment.
No. Now I'll always have this doubt about the car. What, your jaw still hurts?
Hi. I'm ah, I'm here to see a Mr. Art Vandelay..
(Still on the showers) Can I use hot water on my face?
(holding a magazine cover) Mira Sorvino. Think she'd go out with me?
Hmm-hmm, not by a long shot. I'm calling up the Rosses and inviting them up to my non-existent place in the Hamptons. Then we'll see who blinks first.
The nice one that works in my office.
I'll tell you what, if pig-man shows up, we'll squeeze him in. I'll see you later.
So... here I am. Ready to take you to the Hamptons.
Pay phone in L.A., look it's a miracle.
It just didnt work out. What can I do? I wanted to love her. I tried to love her. I couldnt.
There putting in a lost and found because of me. There's a time limit but still.
(at dinner with his cousin) Some more merlot?
I tell you this. If the real Phil Rizzuto was down there, this wouldn't be happening!
Oh no, you're not going out on a high note with me Mr. Kruger!
Why didn't you ask me? I know a million theater jokes. 'What's the deal with those guys down in the pit?'
You know, I used to love Paris. My uh, dead Fiance, Susan.. (opening wallet) In fact I. think I, I may have a picture of her..
You lie! How hard is it to lie?!
The *bank*? This is *found* money. I want to *parlay* it. I wanna make a big score!
I can't tell ya now , he's gonna be back in a ten seconds.
(Still mad a Leslie) Never said goodbye. Goodbye!
S'cuse me ..Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?
Nothing, why? You think something's wrong? Am I different?
(to himself) Yeah, you said it. (to Wilhelm) Uh, excuse me, Mr Wilhelm. Uh, do you really think... Well, is this downtown trip really necessary, you know, for the project?
You know she was behind the idea. She was going to champion the show. That's what I was bring her up there to tell you. And she liked me.
if you hadn't come, this whole thing wouldn't have happen (back on Jerry and Elaine's side, we can hear George saying "I was the one who was invited", Jerry opens the door)
--Astroturf? You know who's responsible for that, don't you?! The Jews! Ah, the Jews hate grass. They always have, they always will.
Ponce de Leon? Okay. (to Jerry) You sure you don't wanna go?
And you really believe this guy doesn't want to have kids.
Listen Sheila it's not what you think. I put my trust into the wrong person. He said the key word was tasteful.
I know. I just sort of leaned on it so it would look like it was mine.
No, no, Hey I'll get it. What's in the BIG salad?
Well I don't know anyone here Jerry. Where else am I going to stay?
Can I say one thing to you? And I say this with an unblemished record of staunch heterosexuality.
Peggy! (they all sit) His daughter Peggy. Peggy's coming over to serve.
Nah. It's all right. Great! She had a good time.
Hu-Yeah, interest. It's an amazing thing. You make money without doing anything...
You know. (All three give him blank stares) I was alone..
What, are you crazy? I can't have a man touching me. Switch with me.
They'll make you a Big Salad. What do you think, they're the only one's that make a Big Salad?
(to Carrie) You know, you're really being very selfish. It would be nice if you would think of someone other than yourself every now and then!
Well I'm very excited about this. I've always wanted to see how those sketch artists do it.
(desperate) Steinbrenner had me committed! I'm in the nuthouse!
Elaine you don't understand. I had 103 temperature when I bought that sweater. I was so dizzy I was seeing red dots everywhere. I thought everything in the store had a red dot on it. I couldn't distinguish one red dot from another. I couldn't afford anything. I have nothing. I haven't worked for a really long time. (Jerry is standing right behind George. Jerry takes out a hankerchief and starts fake-crying in it.) I mean look, I have no clothes, look at what I'm wearing. It's just a little red dot.
Pack of gum. Here you go. (hands the clerk a $100 bill)
All right, let me just... I'm gonna grap an apple.
Kramer, what's the name of the store with the mannequin?
Ah ha, well, I really wouldn't know about that. I don't watch much TV. I like to read. So what do you do, a lot of that "did you ever notice?" this kind of stuff.
Could we talk about this some other time?
(smitten) Audrey? My god, you look incredible! I can't believe it!
Eh, gee, I hope you have the key for these things.
Hey. I got Jon Voight's LeBaron. (Jingles the keys.)
Excuse me, are you the guy with that funny laser?
I- I'm pretty sure I left it eh, behind the cushion of the chair ... accidentally.
(trying to laugh it off) Right. C'mon! I'm having an affair with Elaine?! If I was having an affair with Elaine, I wouldn't tell you I'm going to see Elaine. I would make up some other person to tell you I was gonna go see, and then I would go see Ela..Elaine.
so, uh, Steven.. I see you're president of the chess club.
What, you don't want me to hold your keys?
Look, we're wasting our time here! We're a half-hour late, they've probably took it off the board already.
Dad, that other car cut us off! They had swastikas all over it... They were hurling racial epiphates at us... I could have been killed!
Oh, I was trying to make a point.
I could never do that. You know the ironic thing is if she had a smaller nose, I never could have gone out with her in the first place. She'd be out of my league with a smaller nose. And I really like her, I know that. And I know one other thing. I'm not getting past that nose.
(to Jerry) Whos going to play left field?
(leaving) Yeah, Sure, sure ,,, I got to drop my car off at the new lot.
You never had sex in the office before?
Well, he has to play! He can't just not play. We're playing! Look, I gotta see him, how do I get in touch with him?
See, look at this. (wearing a very tight shirt) Rachel, my T-shirt shrunk. It used to be much bigger, and now it shrunk. You see, that's what water does. It shrinks things.
It's like you're livin' in the Playboy Mansion! Did she, uh, did she frolic?
Yeaah, beautiful... (They try to hit a high five, but George hits Elaine in the forehead.) Sorry...
All right. Don't change me. Susan. Don't change me. Ya know there are a lot of woman that would love to be in your position right now.
Yeah. Steinbrenner wants everyone in the front office to give a lecture in their area of business expertise.
I don't understand what the big deal is. They let you try on pants.
Yes, yes, she had a nose job. I loved her very deeply. Will she ever speak to me again?
I suppose if I had suggested Liam Neeson Day, you'd all be patting me on the back.
Why did it all turn out like this for me? I had so much promise. I was personable, I was bright. (Elaine turns showing disagreement) Oh, maybe not academically speaking, (Elaine nods correct) I was perceptive. I always know when someone's uncomfortable at a party.
Ladies and gentlemen, this (Opens the door, Steven is standing there) is Steven Koren. His G.P.A. is a solid 2.0! Right in that meaty part of the curve - not showing off, not falling behind.
I can't do this! I can't do it. I have tried. I'm here. It's impossible.
I'll tell you something, I've never seen a pilot script as funny as this!
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I used to come here all the time with my fiance, back when it was a meat-packing plant. Ha. Here's her picture. (hands her a magazine page)
Oh, you spoiled, spoiled man. Do you now how much mental energy I expend just trying to picture women naked?
I'm telling you, skip the Drake's wedding, go to the game.
Oh, sports are so pedestrian. I've prepared some science experiments that will illuminate the mind and dazzle the eye.
Maybe we could call them and ask them to return it.
Why don't you just get some Ring Dings from the liquor store?
Well, I know when I'm a little strapped, I sometimes drop off my rent check having forgotten to sign it. That could buy us some time.
Jerry took the flyers off the car, I got the whole thing covered.
Is that the guy who likes fat women?
You don't listen when people talk to you anymore!
I had no Idea you were filled with such....sexuality..
You see, you see? I see things as they are and I say, 'no!' Uh, wait, you see things as they are not and you s- Wait, uh, you see things, do you see things as they are? What do you say when you see things?
I know, I know, thats what they said.
I'll tell you what's insane the price that I could get you on a new desktop computer.
She's too tanned. It's the middle of the winter, she's like a carrot.
I believe you cut me off, and then made an obscene gesture.
Yeah I guess. What can I do? I gotta take her with me. Todd introduced us, I'm obligated.
No, you're not taking a deli slicer to my boss...
Know what? Ponce De Leon is sold out.
You know, if I could get this Coco woman down to Kruger, they wouldn't be able to call me Koko anymore because Kruger would never allow 2 Kokos.
I dunno. I was just talking to the man and he walked out on me!
So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified! But I pressed on -- and as I made my way passed the breakers a strange calm came over me. I-I don't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment  I was a Marine Biologist!
Y'know, now you gotta ask her her name. It's so embarrassing.
(laughing) Have something else. Cmon, have a little dessert?
I think. (Pause as they all look down)
You don't think you can buy the ticket yourself...? No, there, there...you sit, and I'll purchase the ticket for you.
(clipping on shades) Ha.. She'll have to find me first. (leaving)
It is a horrible company. There's no management what so ever. I could go hog wild in there.
Yeah, so what? I'm not the only one! (Kramer enters with his quilt.)
Oh, its a lovely song. (singing) How do you solve a problem like Maria?...
I can't sell the book. It's been marked.
Kramer, I can't help you. You're gonna have to get them some place else.
yeah, I ... I snuck a peak. ... But it was so fast I didn't see anything. It was just a blur.
Do I really have to buy her something?
Yeah, yeah, not fan talk, not gushing, you know? Actual conversation, I was incredibly articulate!
(Picking up the ketchup) What typical? Gimme typical. Gimme some typical.
(he thinks a little about it... and as he puts his hand on his knee and gets up) I'm sorry Karen. I know I care for you, but I just can't stand when someone doesn't like me. (he opens the door)
You know, you're going along, you think everything's all right and all of a sudden you get that tap. (George taps his own shoulder). You know it's like pfffff (whistling sound), all right that's enough, you're through.
Two tickets to "Guys And Dolls"! I'm gonna go with you!
Yes. Live, dammit. Live! Every precious moment as if this was the last year of your life. Because in many ways...it is. (There's a knock at the door.) Excuse me.
My card won't work there; they're not on the Plus system.
Yeah. I got 'em down to fifty bucks. I just have to do all the jackhammering myself.
S, uh, Superman - he, uh, built the fortress of solitude up at the North Pole, to, uh, you know, sort of get away from it all..
It was a good idea. Susan liked it. Now, if he hadn't vomitted all over her, we'd be writing it right now.
Awright, listen, can you uh, gimme a lift back to my place?
What? The guy asked you to HELP HIM MOVE? Wow.
(Looks at her) Yeah, uh, no menus. (Waves her off)
Oh, uh, "The Falconer" by John Cheever. It's really excellent.
I got some cufflinks I could've loaned you.
(to Jerry, sarcastically) Yeah, doctor. Im going to have to wait in that little room all by myself, arent I? (He picks up a crossword puzzle.) I better take this. I hate the little room. (George walks into the hallway that leads to the doctors office.) Oh, hello, Doctor.
Its an incredible deal. I dont know why you dont come with me.
They all have swirling chocolate in the commercial!
What's the matter with you? Are you crazy? Why are you using my name?!
It's that bleak? (pours a glass of milk)
(coyly, he looks down and runs his finger along the top of the chair back in front of him) Do you, uh ... do you know what Im ... thinking about now?
Well, I'm just expressing my gratitude to our gracious host.
I'd argue if I could, Mrs. Enright. (exits) Here we go, all right.
(shouted after Elaine) You know, I got nothing outta this!
Oh, Rita. Hey, Mr. Shermack, how're you doing, good to see you. Jay, always a pleasure. (To Susan) Sweetie. (Kisses her and then sits down next to Jerry) Yeah, yeah, that butler idea, that's beautiful. Isn't that killer? (Aside to Jerry) I thought I was getting the butler.
Yeah, I want to see if there's anything I can do.. maybe get him another job.. maybe I'll hear of something.
Oh come on? No come on. She took off her hat and there she was (waving his hand over his head) hello. It was like I was looking at myself in the mirror.
Tuesday? I can't do it Tuesday. Steinbrenner needs me to run---
Wait, wait. Here me out. Don't dismiss this. You're very quick to dismiss. Don't dismiss. She's got a big crush on David Letterman, I mean, a big crush. She talks about him all the time. Suppose I go up to David Letterman. He works at NBC; I work at NBC. I explain my situation. He agrees to meet her. They go out, they fall madly in love. And she dumps me for David Letterman.
Yeah, and now someone's going to be taking messages for me.
(angry undertone) Oh, I'm gonna give you a Royal bearing. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Lemme get a pack of gum here.
You said you grabbed it outta there real fast, right?
You wanna see?! (pulling off the hat to reveal the bald pate) There! There it is! (turning to Newman) Alright, here! You wanna try on the hat?! Here! Try on the hat!
(Losing it) Don't tell me how to eat!
Yes, yes, but uh, I have to make a call, so...
Ha, ha ha uh, I'm not following that.
You know it's like you never see a really attractive woman getting a traffic ticket.
Look, Deena, I know you think I'm crazy, but I'm not. This is just a series of bad coincidences.
Oh, she's got the hue. So, what's going on with you and Melanie? I mean, I know you're not getting married, but uh, things are happening?
Ive had a lot of other paranormal stuff happen to me.
Uh, twice what youre payin here, but its a great building. Its two bedrooms!
Jon Voight! Are you kiddin' me? Did you talk to him?
(Trying to keep his voice down) I think you've done a lot more than talk! You betrayed me!
Well... we could dance around it a little first.
Wait a minute, that is my apartment. I earned it with 34 years of misery!
It's like going to the bathroom in front of a lot of people and not caring.
Going backstage is the worst. Especially when they stink. You know that's a real problem.
Ya and also I'm afraid that people in that state are finally going to tell me what they really think of me. You know they got nothing to lose what do they care?
My dad was a cook during the Korean War. Something very bad happened, ever since you can't get him near a kitchen.
So, you didn't think this was a date?
Well this worked out okay. So are you going to see the police woman?
Oh, there's a soup stand, Kramer's been going there.
(entering Jerry's bathroom) Well, Hanke's moved on to Step Ten. He was spotted taking personal inventory.
Hey, thanks. I owe you a big one.
All right, relax, tough guy. I got to go out to my father's garage, help him sell some computers.
(after waitress walks away) I don't believe it, she did it again!
Then, the last person to leave is Wilhelm. He sees my car, he figures I'm burning the midnight oil. Between the two of them, they think I'm working an 18 hour day! (he stands there with his hands on his hips, a wide grin - laughing.)
You told him? What did you tell him?
She's got everything, right? (counts on his fingers) She's intelligent, she's smart, she's got a great sense of humour.
You see, It's right here. It's all white...
Jerry, I've been preparing for this moment my entire life.
Parker, I never said driver, I said parker, a great parker.
My face! My face! Get me to the hospital!
More wine and turkey? (Pours Celia more wine)
Come on 'Oh George, oh Geeeooorge!' Come on! Not that I don't appreciate the effort that was put into it.
She asked about me? What did- What did she say?
Yes, I agree. I hope my parents go long before I do.
Oh yeeah.. well , Big smoker... I (coughs some more) gave it up for a while but it was too tough. Y' know.....I got no will power.
It's really not accurate. Nobody drinks from a water cooler any more - they use bottles.
(Needing to get away from his parents, he gets up) I need some air..
Yes, I am familiar with this syndrome -- she's a two-face.
She doesn't Want to talk, she needs to talk.
(Standing in the doorway) I'm fine with it! Fi-hi-hi-hine I say! (Leaves)
Aah, hey. (enthusiastic) If this works out, forget about it. Vacations together, movies together, dinner together. It..it's almost as good as if I didn't get married.
She um, she wants to see The Muted Heart.
(Still with a tone) He is. You dont know what Im doin here.
Sure. Thank you for coming in. (Tom eats some raisins)
This is our new Vice-president of Acquisitions, sir.
Kramer, what are you talking about...Janet doesn't look anything like Jerry
And, it is all because of that car
You know, you go out, you get another rye. Of course, it would have to be the same one from Schnitzer's. You put it in the kitchen somewhere and you say Ohh! There it is.
Well, you know, to be honest sir -- my, my new secretary Ade, came up with that one.
Listen I was talking to Elaine today and she said she'd would really like to be an usher at the wedding
Heh heh heh hey, new suit (raises coffee cup as a salute / toast)
It's, uh, it's not a little chicken. (laughing) Little chicken. It's a gamebird.
Look at where we are! (referring to the seat usher) He's not stopping! He just keeps going and going and going! (the usher abruptly stops at the second row) We're not in the first row?
So what! Have a yoke! It won't kill you.
George, don't make me get tough with you. Whu, hu, hu, hu huuuu (raises arms) Who says that? She is really cool. What do you think? You think she likes me?
(humble) Well, if you must know, shhhe, was my fiance, Susan. May she rest in peace.
Listen, you're lucking I'm not asking for a whole refund. (trying to speak quietly) You gave me ladies' frames!
(to Jerry) It's all white Jerry! It's all white!
She wants to keep it quiet. She... thinks we have a real future together.
Elaine, can I just explain something to you very privately here? Susan and I have been together many, many times now, and just between you and me, there's really no big surprises here, so...make-up sex is all that I have left.
Alright. I guess I just have to pick myself up, dust myself off, and throw myself right back down again!
When are they gonna have the flying cars, already?
...pianist. A *classical* pianist. She *plays* the piano. She's a *brilliant* woman. I-I-I sat in her living room... She played the *Waldstein Sonata*! The *Waldstein*!
A preemptive breakup. This is an incredible idea. I got nothing to lose. We either break up which she would do anyway but at least I go out with some Dignity. Completely turn the tables. It's absolutely brilliant.
I tried to tear it from the side, you can't get a good grip here. You gotta do it like a bag of chips.
(Gestures for Kramer to shut up) Once again, Antonio, I can't even begin to say how deeply, deeply sorry I am about everything. The job, the cat.. (A lamp breaks) the lamp.
Do you know the last time I wore this thing? Six years ago, when I made that toast at Bobby Leighton's wedding.
I dont know. I cant believe theyre making me take this test.
All right there you go. It's a '47 cabin all right. So, we'll see you tomorrow.
Its a great thrill to meet you, Sir.
Thank you Mr.Farkus, thank you very much indeed sir.
Nah, he didn't have anything to do with it...
(Embarrassed) That's all I could find. (A moment passes) Would you mind getting the door?
Ow! What are you doing under there? Hey, stop that! Don't eat that! That's not food! (to Robin) He's suckin' down Equal packets!
Alright that's it. (George walks across the room over to them.) So you get rid of me and now the two of you are going to sleep together?
Don't you see how wrong that is?! Where's your Christmas spirit? And eye for an eye!
So how do you want to do this?
Yes! And I put him up to it, because I'm sick! I'm the one that needs help.
Is-is that what I said 'no story'? Because Jerry had to tell me later.
Because I'm REFRESHED. I finally found a way to sleep in my office. Under the desk. I lie on my back. I tuck in the chair. I'm invisible.
Neeson? How are you comparing Liam Neeson with Jon Voight? Jerry, we're talking about Joe Buck. If you can play Joe Buck, Oskar Schindler's a cake walk. (Opens the car door for Jerry, Jerry's about to get in.)
Let me ask you a question. Who would win in a fight between you and me?
Why?! Because you were stabbed, and.. got coffee thrown in your face, and.. uh.. (Points to Alan's bandaged forehead)
What about the skin? I need a good cheek, I like a good cheek.
Apparently the glue in the wedding invitations was a....toxic.
What's the difference, you're a woman. They're supposed to be touching you.
How do you know it was her dude?
How you gonna catch him? He's probably boarded the plane already.
What about the dolphins? You could swim with the dolphins down there.
(George takes out the suit from the other rack) Well, look at this. (innocently) This doesn't belong here! Someone has made a terrible mistake.
Just a suggestion. (chuckles and walks back to the yelling guy)
Yeah, yeah, yeah. But then, I said to him, 'Oh yeah? Well, the jerk store called, and they're running outta you.'
I have a point, I have a point.
I didnt know there was a fireplace. A fireplace, that's incredible.
Well, sure. They're Jewish, and you're a shiksa.
This is what they would do in the movies! It's a beautiful thing! It's like a movie! I'm gonna slip him a mickey!
Well, sometimes you can't help these people 'til they hit rock bottom.
Jerry Seinfeld. My best friend. He can explain all of this. (calls to Jerry) Jerry.
I tried to be nice. I wasn't nice?
It's all your fault! You and Elaine! All that orgasm talk. She did have an orgasm, she didn't have an orgasm. Orgasm this, orgasm that. I got so focused on it. I started to panic and boom, I lost it. I tried everything, I was talking to him 'Please wake up, do something.'
Who gets picked off in softball? Its unheard of.
I don't know what the reason could be.
Shst, You should take the test for me.
Lot of good ones. I don't even want to mention anyone because I'm afraid I'm going to leave somebody out.
(pause) Dad! I heard you were in the city the other day!
A cup of coffee. That, that doesn't mean anything.
Oh, yeah. You wish you had this coat.
Look...humm..I'm on with Beijing with the hair restauration clinic. Could you talk to them for me and tell them I'd like to place an order.
When you're playing the piano do you think about me?
Well, I wanna put a picture of me and my boss Mr. Morgan up at the office.
You idiots. You're gonna wear down the battery.
Name tags! Name tags! What kind of an idiot thinks anybody would be interested in an idea like that.
I feel like a huge weights been lifted off my shoulders. I... I... I feel happy! Kramer, I dont know how to thank you!
I still don't see why I can't ask her about my arm.
Oh really. You tell her you shaved it?
I'm, uh, George Costanza. I was having dinner with your son.
No, he doesn't know O'Brien, if he knew O'Brien he wouldn't have a sign. Let's just do it.
No, I know I don't have to, I want to.
May I just use your bathroom for a moment?
Well, aren't you the boss of him? You shouldn't let him move up! When I was in the Cub Scouts, I got stuck on Weebolos for three years 'cause I kept losing the Pinewood Derby.
(embarrassed/self-conscious about his gut) Do I? Thanks.. You too..
Reilly is no longer with the club. (getting up) You believe that?
Of course I'm not Cartwright! Look, why don't you two just go to the movies all by yourselves, I'm not in the mood.
But really, it's enough with the bar already.
Oh, you might want to stick around Jerry. Mr. Thomassoulo picked the wrong man to hire because he was fake handicapped.
It's standard. Has she left you one of those messages where she uses up the whole machine?
Wait a minute, wait, it's not that stupid.
Lupe. That's very nice, very nice. Listen, are you going to be making up the bed in the morning?
(dismayed) I didn't even know you wanted to get serious!
I'm stuck. Pull a little, just a second. Don't start the train! Don't start the train!!
Those are my friends I was telling you about. We're gonna talk to them, pull over.
I don't know of this is the house. I don't see Jerry's car anywhere.
Hey, a "hit" is a totally different story.
(singing) Master of the house/Doling out the charm/Ready with a handshake and an open palm/Tells a saucy talk/Loves to make a stir/Everyone appreciates a...
What does she need? Maybe there's something that she needs.
Yeah, that's exactly what I'm worried about. God would never let me be successful. He'd kill me first. He'd never let me be happy.
Those birthdays. I told you. They're relationship killers. If a relationship is having any problems whatsoever, a birthday will always bring it out.
I'm cheap? You think I'm CHEAP? How could you say that to me? I can't believe this. How could you say that to me?
Just take it off. I'm getting hot just looking at it.
Well, I'm still here. You took out the other guy!
There's no house! It's a lie! There's no solarium. There's no Prickly Pete. There's no other solarium.
He knows I'm waiting. He sees me. He just doesn't wanna look.
Well then she's just a Liar, Isn't she?
So, you want to come down to Mario's Pizza with me and help me pick up the Frogger?
If only she could get fired. Is there any way that could happen? I mean I know how to get myself fired.
Maybe I'll go down to the track. Put it all on a horse...
Well ...... but how do I get someone else fired?
(smiling) I'm on a winning ball club, Jerry. They probably wanna pick my brains.
(picking up what Frank saw as a mouse) It's the remote.
We are really late now. We're in big trouble. Big trouble.
Didn't say anything. (They go into Elaine's apartment.)
I don't understand lunch, I don't know anything about lunch. Listen. Just because I got the guy fired doesn't mean I turned him into a bum - does it?
(smiling) Ho ho. Funny. Isn't he funny? Funny guy. Ha ha ha.
Did you dressed nice, did you do it classy?
Yes, In fact, her mother is in the hospital right now. It's some kind of a Diverticulitis. (he continues walking slowly towards Steinbrenners desk)
(pleased with himself) You are having problems with your boyfriend and I am meeting you to discuss the situation.
You know, I can't remember the last time I called a woman without being nervous. I, usually, I'm pacing all over the room, I'm...
(singing as he exits florist with bouquet and a cup of coffee) "...tootsie, good-bye. Too-too, tootsie..." (takes a drink, makes a face, shouts back at shop) You call this coffee? (dumps out coffee behind him, accidentally hitting a parked car's windshield)
Hey. How come I didn't get a Christmas card? Everybody else got one. Jerry got one, Kramer got one. I thought we were good friends. I don't get a Christmas card. I don't get it.
I think she wants me to take her home.
I just remembered, th-th-there's this Chinese restaurant out near Yankee Stadium, that puts flyers on all the cars.
I'll tell you what. Why don't we just get a couple of dishes and we'll just share 'em.
Jerry, unless I pull down on this statuette and a hidden wall opens up, we have checked every square inch of this apartment!
This...is an organizer, a secretary, and a friend.
Yes, full. I love to be full ... love to sit back, loosen the old belt and digest away for hours. Let those enzymes do their work.
Festivus, Sir. And, uh, I was afraid that I would be persecuted for my beliefs. They drove my family out of Bayside, Sir!
I was squinting! Remember that drive from Wortsborough? (snapping his fingers) I was spotting those raccoons.
Yeah, "duty". Do you know how much duty is?
I have to get in touch with Tatiana! And look at his little outfit. It's all so coordinated, the way his socks matching to his shirt. I really hate this guy.
You see if I stay the whole year, I get it all.
Why'd I think it was timbre? Yeah, she could do voiceover commercials, why didn't you tell me about her voice?
Students cant clean. Its anathema. (explaining) They dont like it.
(Holding his drink up to his mouth) Oh my gosh, I just had a great idea. She could come to the party tomorrow and read Gwen's lips for me.
Uh, we're cool. Everything's cool (to security attendent)
You should have somebody take a look at that.
I'm the bad boy. I've never been the bad boy.
So I saw that new movie about the Hindenburg.
Well say were frightened and we have to go home.
Oh, what? What? That? Are you kidding? I didn't quit. What? You took that seriously?
I take it off when I go to the, uh, y'know, to the "office".
Yeah, drove away.. You know, I said 'Hello' to him. You know, he's - he's-
What idea? I just said something. I didn't know you were going to listen to me.
Got her machine. Im dead, Im a dead man. Thats it. Im dead, Im a dead man. Dead man.
Of course! Alright, maybe I'll say something to Buck.
(anger) Well now it's not gonna be original! It's gonna lose all its cachet!
Hey, by the way, if anybody wants an inside tour of the zoo, Siena works there as a trainer.
Jerry, what do you, you wanna, you wanna see the place or not?
Give me the phone. (dials) Yea, Hi I would like to speak to Patrice. ... what? ... oh really? ... oh, ok, thank you, ... (hangs up)
Well, why don't *you* go, and I could save the seats. You said you didn't like saving anyway.
No one gives us the finger! We're Yankees!
(taking it out of his jacket pocket) yeah I got some sandwiches.. I got tuna.. and salmon salad Tony because I know you don't like peanut butter
Well, if I hear you correctly--and I think that I do--my advice to you is to finish your meal, pay your check, leave here, and never mention this to anyone again.
I thought tomorrow maybe we'd try a little corn beef.
Tim, who's the head of the Aryan Union, you or me?
(Muttering out, not really wanting to talk about his family) When the Costanzas came here, one brother stayed behind.
Anna actually has respect for me now. (laughs/snorts) It's all over.
You already have an in. You have the same first name!... (no reaction) 'Jerry'!
What about a rec room? Huh? Or a community center.
[realizing the only way out is to show the stub] I've got the stub.
Alright, alright, fine. (Gives the keys to Elaine.)
Jerry ... Where are you? I know you like to sit back here. Elaine! Susan!
"What day is today?....Aw. ..Tuesday! Damn it. I shouldn't have worked out today. Mr Wilhem has called a big meeting and now I'm gonna be sweating through the whole thing."
Uh, excuse me, uh, um, Jason. I don't want to get into a big thing here, but... I'm not sure if, technically, what you just said was actually an apology.
She probably never heard it. Don't you see what this means? It's like the whole thing never happened. It's like when Superman reversed the rotation of the earth to save Lois Lane!
I dont know why you even bother with this ping pong guy, Ill tell you that.
No, but I can tell she's going to. I can sense it. We had this terrible phone conversation. I was so nervous before I called I made up this whole list of things to talk about.
Alright, well why don't we smooth the head down to nothing, stick a pumpkin under its arm and change the nameplate to Ichabod Crane?
That's why the world's in the shape it's in.
(seeing Elaine and Puddy come into Monk's) Yeah. Hey, Lainie, Puddy.
Well just take an overview. Can't you just take an overview?
(frustrated) Oh, look at this. There's no place to park around here. I don't even know why they sell cars in Manhattan.
Ok. Good. And Kramer, you're in charge of taping off the loading zone.
(coming back in) Alright, alright. Can we go out and eat?
So I still haven't heard about that job.
Well, I wish I could say the same, but I must say, with all due respect, I find it very hard to see the logic behind some of the moves you have made with this fine organization. In the past twenty years you have caused myself, and the city of New York, a good deal of distress, as we have watched you take our beloved Yankees and reduced them to a laughing stock, all for the glorification of your massive ego!
Because my cousin's imbecile dog was rolling around outside and they got in his carpet.
Oh, please don't tell me you love me again, Jerry, I can't handle it.
Look, I have my system. First I look for the dream spot right in front of the door, then I slowly expand out in concentric circles.
Yeah for two hours. She's nuts about you.
Okay, I guess I'll see you down there.
(Standing up, still waking up) Alright, you know what we should do? We should go to the movies. Get away from this script for a while..
Hennigans. I was there sitting in the office and the cleaning woman comes in. I've always been attracted to cleaning women. Cleaning women, chambermaids.
You know, anything in the, in the lip area is good.
I have to have my tonsils taken out.
Wish I could. (raises the magazine up in front of his face and continues reading.)
I'm cold too. At least you've got a coat. Let's get in the car.
Wha! You know, it's a pain to change that. You gotta lift up that plastic thing with a pen.
You might want to try it...makes the movie more enjoyable, that's all.
No, I don't know who was doing that.
Mind? Why would I mind? I would love to wait! (shakes hands with Nana) Nana, nice to see you. Ni-ni-ni-ni-NANA! (embraces another guest, kisses her) Aunt Phyllis, always a pleasure. What a pleasure! Hey, let's do this again real soon. I had fun, huh?
Is it flowing? I like flowing, cascading hair. Thick lustrous hair is very important to me.
Have to give him time on this hour.
Huh. Excuse me (to Ping) Hum... Do you speak chinese?
When you're talking about a movie like "Beaches", moving from the chair to the couch , . . . that's quite a voyage.
I'm trying to buy some of the clothes back. (realizing something) Hey you wanna come over for dinner tonight? My mother made all this extra Paella.
He did it right as he said "her unfortunate accident."
Oh hey, by the way. Do you want a box 'a, Cuban cigars? I smoked one last night. I got nauseous.
All right. Kramer, you block off traffic. You to go sweet-talk the pharmacist.
I can't perform under pressure. That's why I never play anything for money, I choke. I could choke tonight. And she works in my office, can you imagine? She goes around telling everyone what happened? Maybe I should cancel, I have a very bad feeling about this.
(forced buoyancy) Hey, you know, let's call Susan, we'll go have coffee.
See? This looks right to you, doesn't it?
You know, this is very nice, but I really could take a cab. Really.
Well, he said it could be cancer, maybe you should get it checked out.
I understand you offer a 50%-off 'bereavement' fare...?
Dollar Eighty-Nine. Why is this a dollar eighty-nine? Why is there no haggling in this country?
Dogs, twists, a kind of fermented chicken drink.
Oh, I had no choice. She squeezed it out of me! Shed tell me she loved me. All right, at first, I just look at her. Id go, Oh, really? Or uh, Boy, thats, thats something. But, eventually you have to come back with, Well, I love you. You know, you can only hold out for so long.
Excuse me sir. Would you mind watching my bag for a minute?
How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria?
(to the executives) Excuse me. Did you hire the Sunshine Carpet Cleaners?
Ho, ha, ho! Jerry Seinfeld's a funny guy!
Yeah, woman have no problem getting the hand off. How do they do that?
All right. I will see you boys later.
Got it. (the waitress walks away) Did you just see what happened here?
I love these people, you can't ask 'em questions. (getting excited) They're so mentally gifted that we mustn't disturb the delicate genius unless it's in the confines of an office. (worked up) When huge sums of money are involved, then the delicate genius can be disturbed!
Oh, she's a Kramer. And uh, while I was there I uh happened to pick up another juicy little nugget about our friend.
And so, for all these reasons, we are officially broken up. (shuts book and reaches for door) Thank you, (opens door) and good night.
I got him Yankee's tickets! He got me a piece of paper saying "I've given your gift to someone else!"
You know what the temperature in Florida is today? Eh? Seventy-nine. That's almost eighty. Yeah, I read someplace the life expectancy in Florida is eighty-one and in Queens, seventy-three.
No, I'm fine. I'm good. I'm very good.
Well, as I say, the pink-eye made my vision...quite blurry... (Joe's daughter comes to the door.)
She had an itch. She could have used any one of those fingers. That finger was meant for me.
Do you hold the neck together with one hand, or are you just letting it flap in the breeze?
All right, let's postpone it. Let's get out of here.
(frustrated) Fine. Fine. (to customer) Excuse me. (heading for the door) Think I'm gonna forget about this? I haven't forgotten about this. I don't forget that easily!
Cmon. Wilkinsons got millions invested in this stock. Its gone up three points since Ive been watching it.
Yes, now. It's gonna take a few days and my parents are gonna be back. I gotta have it back before them!
He's got Marlon Brando's. I could go to Marlon Brando's house if I really wanted.
What, are you kidding? (Points at the flaws of Jerry's hands) The knuckles are all out of proportion. you got hair over there - where do you get off comparing your hands to my hands?! This is a one-in-a-million hand. (Points to his own hand)
You're giving me the "it's not you, it's me" routine? I invented "it's not you, it's me". Nobody tells me it's them not me, if it's anybody it's me.
Sure. You know, Rhisa. I've always found you... very attractive.
Hello, oh, hello. You remember, ... Susan, from N B C.
(Gloating) Hey, you got any extra furniture down there? I need some more stuff to fill that extra bedroom with the walk-in closet. (Smiles)
(Not wanting to make Elaine mad) I guess it's not important.
Well, they're more than an underwear to me Mr. Farkus. Two cups in the front, two loops in the back. How do they do it?
So, we watching the movie, or are we still talking? (Joe's wife shakes her head and goes into the other room. George gestures to Remy to move.) Okay, c'mon. Let's go.
All right, look. I'm getting the Chow Fung. You don't have to have any.
Was this something you had planned for a while?
I can't believe you're not playing in cotton.
Eh eh eh, can't do it, can't do it, sorry, I got a date.
Why did the policeman have to yell at me like that? (Elaine enters)
'Maybe you know some little places to go, where they never close...'
You know you buy a big salad for somebody it would be nice if they knew it.
Not me. Everything should be negotiable. (he picks up a container of fruit)
I don't know why Rachel had to drive back with Michael and Carol.
(excited, pushing Jerry forward) All right, let's go, let's go, let's go, come on.
All I know is I've been going to doctors all my life. What has it gotten me? I'm thirty-three years old. I haven't outgrown the problems of puberty, I'm already facing the problems of old age. I completely skipped healthy adulthood. I went from having orgasms immediately to taking forever. You could do your taxes in the time it takes me to have an orgasm. I've never had a normal, medium orgasm.
Really? Because people do meet in places besides a bar, huh?
(Slowly backing away, he's not at all committed to the conversation) Yeah.. television.
(Yelling out, frustrated. The camera spins from a top angle) Twwwwiiiiiixxxxx!
Yeah, yeah, right here. (hands it to him)
Ade, ahh, ahh, ah ... Im giving you a raise!
I'm gonna go meet Danielle. (grabs his coat) There's a new Neil in town! (triumphant laughter) Hahaha!
Jerry, I can't talk to Jerry anymore. Ever since he moved into that apartment he's too much ... like you.
here Elaine here, Superman (hands a comic book to Elaine, who passes it to Tony) please, next time it will only be the two of us
This is a *great* idea! Here... use this one. I get frequent flyer miles with every purchase... Wait! Get two tickets. As long as your turning it in for a refund what's the difference? I'll get *double* the bonus miles.
Y'know there are tribes in Indonesia where if you keep your coat on in somebody's house, the families go to war!
Yeah, I do that too. I feel guilty about getting the pleasure. I feel like I don't deserve it so I talk. It stops me from enjoying it. There's nothing to eat in here.
No, Im saying, if a situation arose in which you didnt want it, I might take it.
And who's responsible for making hate mongering and fascism popular again?
I'm not through here, Jerry. (Picks up the model of the conference room.) I'm gonna keep on investigating. This thing is like an onion. The more layers you peel, the more it stinks. (Pam enters, George leaves.)
Maura. (starts acting dramatically, looking from Maura to Loretta and back again) Oh, my God! What are you doing here?!
Yesterday, took the day off. (Picks up a red Power Ranger action figure from the model and pretends it's him.) Now, from the time I left the room...
Well, she doesn't really want to see Firestorm.
Would you mind helping me out with some of this stuff?!?
Well, I'm sure they'll be able to fix it. You can't stop modern science. Can't stop it, you can't stop it. Can't stop science. Can't be stopped, no way, no how, science just marches--
Oh, no no no. I pay what I say.
(proffering glasses) I hope prune juice is alright. It's the only thing I had that was chilled.
(shouting) I'm not looking for another line. I got the line.
(shouts) Awright already!! This is a very key issue with me, Jerry. I had this name for a long time.
What kind of a shake does he have?
Oh, man, it's spinach! I've been walking around like this all afternoon.
Make-up sex? You have to have that right after the fight, we're way past that.
For a mental patient. Wait a minute, the phone, we'll call the police.
(to Jerry) How could we not hear anything? What's with this Russel? What's he doing? (Jerry raises his arms and shoulders like he doesn't know)
He said he didn't know what it was.
It's not really a mental institution. It's more like a depression clinic. She went out to Woodhaven and checked herself in. I'm, I'm sick over this.
My car's totaled. It's all his fault and now, he has absolutely no money. There is no way that he can pay me. So the judge decrees that he becomes my butler.
(trying to laugh it off) No, I was just wondering. The information could be relevant.
No, it hit the table, it hit the table.
Maybe somebody did it and didn't take credit for it. Maybe it was already done and didn't need doing in the first place. I have no idea who did it, what they did, or how they did it so well. And you know what? Jimmy crack corn and I don't care.
I suppose he's an attractive man, I ,
Ha ha. Everything's timed out to perfection, Jerry. Slippery Pete's got the Frogger running on battery power, the truck will be there any minute, and Kramer's taped out the loading zone.
You know, like the general manager of a baseball team or something.
Yeah! Look at me! I was free and clear! I was living the dream! I was stripped to the waist, eating a block of cheese the size of a car battery!
Ah, see, Mister.. I didn't write that report. That, that's not mine.
Okay, uh, look, if you want to just keep on doing the same old thing, then maybe this idea is not for you. I, for one, am not going to compromise my artistic integrity. And I'll tell you something else, this is the show and we're not going to change it. (To Jerry) Right?
All right. So, you hold out your money, speak your soup in a loud, clear voice, step to the left and receive.
(running out and away from the van) I knew it wasn't Berkowitz!
After dark? Please. At their age, that's like swallowing stun grenades.
When I asked him if it was cancer, he didn't give me a "get outta here". That's what I wanted to hear "Cancer? Get outta here?"
Yeah, you're right, you're right. (To Elaine) Alright, maybe he's not interested, but you still know him - can't you just ask him?
No, no, no, this suit is not for sale. (tries to take off the suit from the guy)
Oh no, in and out, I made sure of that. And you'll be happy to know I perused the script and it's met with my approval.
Now she thinks we're gay, not that there's anything wrong with it...
Forget about smelling the car. Smell the valet. Go to the source...
What if he's waiting for me outside? He pointed at me! Did you see him point?!
So you could call a woman for a date, ask her if she's free for Dinner and a flamenco?
No, I don't have any change. I never carry change.
Jerry, just remember. It's not a lie... if you believe it.
I don't think I could do it. You know, they always remember the first time. I don't want to be remembered. I wanna be forgotten.
You see I disagree. I'd rather be dating the blind. You know you could let the house go. You could let yourself go. A good looking blind woman doesn't even know you're not good enough for her.
Well, not really. After all, she did get together with George Peppard. I mean, Fred.
Shhhhh. If you want to get in, theres very little time. (calling to the waitress) Sweetheart.. (Waitress approaches and tears off a check. George stops her.) No, no, no. That ought to cover it. (He hands her some money; she turns to leave; George stops her.) Just a second. Just a... let me jus-peek... (He looks at the check, then takes some money out of her hand. George urges Jerry and Elaine to eat.) Come on, come on, come on...
How come you don't know what street are you on?
Yeah and you get this really cool T-shirt when you sign on..
Hey I'll get married if I have to. Al Netchie will think twice before he opens his mouth about me again.
So he walks out of the stall, he's been talking the whole time.
I like to stop at the duty free shop.
Boy, she is nice. I like her, I like her Jerry. She's got substance. She oozes substance.
Yeah, no pop-in, no "in the neighborhood," no "I saw your light was on." And the best part is, if things go really well...
I am. The folks are twelve hundred miles away. (gleeful) I'm basking in the buffer zone. (looks for the waitress) 'Nother piece of pie here!
(Hands Antonio a card) Here's my card. I'm in real estate, so, if you're ever looking for something bigger, something nicer.. (Antonio is staring at him, angered) ..maybe not right now. Anyway.. (Extends his hand for a handshake. Antonio doesn't move)
There must be some way to find out.
'Just listen to the music of the traffic, in the city. Linger on the sidewalk, where the neon lights are pretty.' Where the neon lights are pretty. The Broadway area?
Oh no no no no, don't say anything to Kramer. Susan can't stand him. He vomited all over her.
Mulva! (again pointing finger at Jerry -- Kramer watches the exchange back and forth)
Elaine, this pilot...it doesn't matter to me, it's not me I'm concerned about...it's my mother. I've been over to the hospital to see her...
I insist. Ill fix us a drink. (phone rings  who would that be?) I got it.
No...no...no, I hate to tell you this. Youre not gonna see this woman.
You see, my friend here, his aunt passed away last night.
Hey, last night, I found a whole Weeble Village right behind the EZ Bake oven.
(through mouthful of food) So, Carrie, you and Susan are cousins. So your baby daughter is gonna be Susan's second cousin, right? So what does that make me?
I got about fifty-feet out and suddenly, the great beast appeared before me. I tell ya he was ten stories high if he was a foot. As if sensing my presence he let out a great bellow. I said, "Easy big fella!" And then, as I watched him struggling I realized, that something was obstructing its breathing. From where I was standing I could see directly into the eye of the great fish!
Well you didn't have to say it like that.
She said first row! Right behind the dugout!
(Laughs slightly) A physician married to a salesman. (Chuckles) Well, I gotta tell you, Beth, you coulda done a lot better than him.
All right You really want to know?...It all started when she told met hat...she was the voice on your tape recorder.
Yeah. Hey Jerry, listen to this. I discovered something even better than conjugal visit sex. Fugitive sex! Now, it's like everytime -
My whole life has been a complete waste of time, (chuckle)
Come on. Ya wanna go get some lunch?
Im starving. You got any of those free donuts you use to soften people up?
You know, I got this little swelling right here. (rolls up his sleeve to expose his wrist) It's kinda painful. What d'you make of it?
Where you going? I-I thought I could count on you for a little compassion.
My heart! My heart! (To Assistant) Where you going? Are you crazy?!
She says she has to come to New York on business...
(Studying the salt shaker) I'm not taking a civil service test.
Actually I think I'm gonna take a few days off (starts to leave)
I'm not going to break a hundred on this thing.
All right, stop it! Stay away from my breasts! Chest!
Pauline? . . . Wait a minute. I got it. My brother once impregnated a woman named Pauline.
It's impossible. I got him a wake up service.
(clears throat) Maura, I, uh- I want you to know... I-I've given this a lot of thought. I'm sorry, but... we, uh, we have to break up.
D'oh...Oh, oh, the judge! I hate this guy!
The prop comic? (Ronnie holds up his water gun and smiles.) Oh, hi...I didn't recognize you, what...did you get a haircut?
If this lip reading thing works tonight do you know how incredible this is going to be? It's like having Superman for your friend.
Look, I really appreciate your coming, but if you wouldn't mind - try not to say too much.
I don't think I've ever spoken to her.
It took a couple of hours of convincing. I was persistent. I was just like those guys in the movies. And it worked! She said "Yes"! I can't believe my luck that she was still available . A beautiful woman like that. You think she's good looking, right?
I love the chop sticks. I, I personally prefer a fork but they look very nice.
What is this? Did you ever get the feeling like you've had a haircut but you didn't have one? I'm all itchy back here.
We're gonna hang around here a little while....something funny going on here
(smug) Ah, I guess I showed Neil who's Neil.
What is this 'saving movies' thing? Something's playing, you go.
I don't want Morgan's job. He's got a lot of work to do. Hey, Elaine, your friend never woke up Mr. Morgan.
Everybody likes pesto. You walk into a restaurant, that's all you hear - pesto, pesto, pesto.
Make myself comfortable. What does that mean? Does she want me to take my clothes off? Is she taking her clothes off? What if I take my clothes off and she still has hers' on? Then I really look like an idiot. She could get offended and leave. So maybe I should leave them on, but what then if she takes her off? Then she'll feel humiliated. 'Make yourself comfortable'. I got this unbelievable woman and this 'comfortable'-thing can ruin me. I got it! I take my shoes off and sit on the bed. There, that's comfortable. She can't accuse me being unconvertible.
(To Susan) I told you it looked like her..
Wait a second, wait a second...and then the butler says, "I'm not cleanin' it up! I'm sick of cleaning!"
Well I didnt do it for my mother.
Hey, Tim. Quick question. Is it normal for your teeth to make noises, like a hissing or a chirping?
(chuckles) Bye, thanks. (To Jerry, when Susan is far) I can't believe she took the money.
Hey, where you just at the health club?
I probably didn't hear it on the way over because of the street noise. (he panics) This is no good! I got to meet these guys from MacKenzie for lunch in half an hour!
Someone's have to unhook the boat before it leaves...the place!
Pick up the phone, Elaine. Pick it up!
I didn't know whether to try and keep her from falling, or zip up.
(Interrupts) And I still say hes naked under there!
I hurt it in a hotel room. You know where they tuck the covers in real tight in those hotel rooms? I can't sleep like that so I tried to kick it out and I pulled it.
You know what I think? I bet she stole a tractor.
(shouts) Of course there's something wrong! (points at Jerry) We had a pact!
I don't know, she said she had to pick up a friend of hers at the airport. It cost me a hundred dollars this ticket.
What are you doing here? I thought you said you hated Isabella's?
(gets up to leave the table) HELLO!!! (angrily)
Well, you know, I shouldn't have let you into Kramer's, now you want to go into Elaine's...she entrusted me with her spare keys, how can I just let you in?
(Defensively loud) It was when I was banging!
Who's going to bomb you. An airline for all the stupid little peanut jokes.
(jubilant) Five thousand dollars? She doesnt have five thousand dollars!
She's confiding in him about our dates. You always like the person you talk to about the date more than the date! It's just a matter of time till they realize, 'Hey, we could have sex.'
(back-pedalling) No, he, he didnt actually tell me that, uh, we were talking about that commercial  in fact I think I brought it up because I like that commercial. No, he, he would never tell me anything. He never discusses anything. Hes, hes like a clam. Youre not gonna mention this, to him...
(Sincerely) Thank you.. I, uh.. that might not work out.
Does that mean I have to go too?
Did I need that pointed out for me? What is that going to do for me? How does that help me, to see her? I'm trying to live my life. Don't show me that.
Come on. Come check out my new place. It'll take you two minutes.
Well I just got the estimate. It's going to cost more to fix that roof than the car's worth, So I'm going over to see that hospital administrator today. Someone is gonna pay for this damage and it's not gonna be me.
I don't understand. They're supposed to be casting this week. Something's wrong. Maybe they're not doing it.
Wait a minute, wait a minute, do you think I?m comfortable here. I can't change, I?ve got no clothes here! You've got to go like that, I can?t go like this alone!
I will never understand the bathrooms in this country. Why is it that the doors on the stalls do not come all the way down to the floor?
Where are you meeting these women? When they get off the bus at the port authority?
You know this whole thing never would have happened if you hadn't bailed out on me at the restaurant.
Come on! No doctor would put that on his car.
I want you to have this job. Of course...
What do think I tell Jerry everything? It's not like he's my wife.
Yeah, my cleaning lady's Portuguese. I must've picked it up.
And then assuming the strike is resolved, on April 14th, we, ah, play the Angels. So lets clear a floor at the Anaheim Hotel.
Yeah, yeah, well, because of the cane. You should see the bathroom they gave me!
Yeah, of course she did. That's all I ever heard growing up is 'Why can't you be more like Lloyd Braun?' Did you know he was in a mental institution?
(tearing out cheque) Yeah, same time. (hands over cheque) There you go.
I change I change. Two weeks ago I tried a soft boiled egg. Never liked it before. Now I'm dunkin a piece of toast in there and I'm loving it.
Yeah. She should be commending me for treating everyone like equals.
Yes, well, I sat down with Mr. Steinbrenner. I told him you have been doing great work. I said that you deserved a raise, and if you didnt get it, that I, was leaving. (motions with both arms in a circular motion to his right)
Kramer, I, I, I, uh, I need to talk to Jerry privately.
Officer, could I just explain something to you?
(tasting the wine) Excellent. Like I really know what I'm talking about.
Theyre the ones who should be ashamed. They signed me to a one-year contract. As long as I show up for work every day, they have to pay me.
Don't you see. Women like that are like, members of a secret tribe living in a forbidden city. People like me have not been inside in thousands of years.. But with this, it's like I've already been with one of her own! My hands been stamped! I come and go as I please!
(on the answering machine) Jerry, what's happening? Come on, pick up the phone.
Why'd you pick Hoover? Was he that interesting to talk to?
I'll tell ya, if I ever get out of here, I'm gonna change my life. I'm gonna do a whole Zen thing. Take up yoga, meditate.. I'll eat right. Calm down, lose my anger.. (Sees Jerry and Elaine aren't listening. He snaps) Hey, is anybody listening?!
It's about the show. It... No, it was...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's it. More of that, difficult. I'm a difficult seed.
This is amazing. (George gets up to leave and shake's man's hand) Thank you. Thank you very much. . . . I'm going back in! . . . You'll feel better (to woman)
Watch the arm! Tim, listen, we don't want to bother you, we know you're busy here.
Anyway, I think everything else is okay. Unless of course she's faking.
What's wrong? I'll tell you what's wrong. I just committed adultery!
I think that's what the back of closets are for.
And the amazing thing is she eats like there's no tomorra'. I mean I've never seen an appetite like this. Desserts. Everything. I don't know how she does it.
No, and you weren't funny last night either. In fact, you got us both so depressed, she asked me to drive her home after dinner.
Oh, hello, it's you! (angry) Listen lady, I got six minutes left on that meter, and I'm not budging til you admit you stole my twenty dollars. (smug) Huh-hu-hur, you're not so tough when you're not on your horse, are you Ruthie?
What do you need her for? There's a million lawyers.
Wait, wait a minute...they don't have them anymore. I just found out, they just took them off the market.
Ah, get outta here. The vomiting is much funnier.
Must be one of those rich, spoiled handicapped people, who didn't want to do any work, and just wanted to sit in her wheelchair and take it easy.
In the whole world right now, there's maybe three emergencies. Why would you think, on this entire planet, that you're one of those three?
It was fantastic, Jerry. We wound up talking all night.
(chuckling to himself) Housewarming gift. (swerving the car to go to the antique stand) All right, we're taking it up a notch!
Great, great. So anytime you want you can just visualize her naked.
Of course, the uh, the four passes. (closes partition) Four passes to Madison Square Garden? Wait a minute. Wait a minute! Of course! Chicago! The Knicks are playing the Bulls tonight!
I'm the one he wants! He's coming to settle the score.
(walking back) Are you sure? 'Cause it could really help me out of a jam.
Cops. I don't even care about cops. I wanna see more garbage men. It's much more important. All I wanna see are garbage trucks, garbage cans and garbage men. You're never gonna stop crime, we should at least be clean.
Hey! Wow, the K-Man! (They walk into the kitchen inside)
Yeah, the tenant association has decided to hear my side of the story. So, uh, I gotta kinda get ready. I'll see ya.
Be careful, you're getting blood all over the car.
I figured you'd cruise. At least through the Spring.
I never heard him say anything really funny.
(talking to nobody) I like horses. Maybe I could be a stable boy.
I don't see how I could perform sexually in a situation after something like that. I was completely emasculated. Anyway, it's not the only reason.
Slippery Pete, Kramer tells me you are one hell of a rogue electrician. And shlomo, you're the best truck driver.
Oh, I found him. He was sitting on the steps of the library. I sat down next to him. He smelled like the locker room after that game against Erasmus
(Frantically, takes phone and screams...) He'll call you back.
What? I'm not married. I'm not allowed to go out with somebody else?
What I said? I say stupid things all the time I can't go two minutes without saying stupid things.
This is a real piece of junk. I don't even feel safe on this thing. I have a good mind to write a letter toMr. Kimbrough.
Oh...(is about to tell Jerry, but reconsiders) ...clothing, something, I dunno. So, uh, what are you doing today?
Aah, yeah, yeah. Won't you head on in, we'll be in in a second. Be right with you.
Well, it would be OK if Darryl was here.
No wait, you can't just leave me here! Will I see you again?
Here's the TV. I know you wanted to watch the Super Bowl. Do you at least have some towels we could sit on? It's, like, a four hour game.
uh.. maana? huh maana might.. huh maana might be a problem, I'm supposed to have huh a boil lanced maana. Huh you know I think they charge me if I cancel with only one maana's notice
Well at least you and I are talking about how there's nothing to talk about.
I won fifty bucks! Boy, this is great. Too bad Elaine's not here.
I'm not stealing it. They owe me ten dollars. They stole from me.
Don't look around. Don't look around. That's what he wants.
Listen. You're beautiful. You're intelligent. You'll meet other girls...
She doesn't deserve a baby shower. She deserves a baby monsoon. She deserves Rosemary's baby!
Oh, no, no, not at all. No, I have always felt that the most important thing in the world is spending time with family.
Excuse me, sir, do you have the time?
Damn you, laser guy! You had to grab it all with your lowbrow laser shtick! You're just a prop comic! Where's the craft?!
OK, OK, I never even had him for gym.
This MacKenzie, he's a bit of a nut. Someone told me he fired the last guy because his nose whistled when he breathed.
(Nervous, his voice cracks) Hey, Antonio. How's it going?
This is not good. World's are colliding! George is getting upset!
Well, I, I got the pilot of the Jerry show.
Can't find them. That's marvelous. The dance continues.
(upset) Could you put a little thought into this? Jerry's gone, you could humour me. He humours me.
So I tell Alec that I have to go to Paris for an undetermined amount of time. Then all I have to do is buy some post cards and have your parents mail them from Paris.
Listen, listen, dont get worked up, cause youre gonna know the whole story the minute she steps off the plane.
The Chinese have done it my friend. The Chinese have done it.
You know what? it's better than Elaine's, too. I gotta give her a call. (Moves tward the phone)
I'm not stable? I'm like a rock. I take these glasses off, you can't tell the difference between me and a rock. I put these glasses on a rock. You know what jumps into most people's minds? Costanza!
He said he didn't care. Oh, God I love that place. Hey, have you seen other dermatologist?
(animated) What're you talking about?! She's very concerned! She said she was gonna get it back.
You could take the IQ test for me. I could pass it to you out a window. We could do it, she lives in the first floor.
I just don't think it's such a great idea for you to sit here.
(entering the apartment more fully) Oh. Oh, hi, hi. Hi. Nice to meet you. (peering at the table) What're you having, veal?
Okay, so you remember I made the initial call Sunday, she doesnt call back. I call again Monday, I leave another message. I call Tuesday, I get the machine again, I know youre there, I dont know what your story is. Yesterday, Im a volcano  I try one more call, the machine comes on, and I let fly like Mussolini from the balcony, Where the hell do you get the nerve? You invite me up for coffee and then you dont call me back for four days? I dont like coffee, I dont have to come up. Id like to get one more shot at the coffee just so I could spit it in your face.
Let me ask you this. If you stick your hand in the hair is it easy to get it out?
(hearing Jerry broke up with Patty) Are you still down in the dumps? Come on. It's just a chick.
Hey, what's another million, give or take. I get off where and when I wanna get off.
Jerry, this whole Ellen situation.. has gone far enough.
Oh, no, no, no...you sit right here...I will get you a nice snack.
My name is not mentioned in this blurb...
He didnt do anything, Jerry. Its a scam! Who told you to do that?
Well, cause we were just saying we were going to ask you to come up to the country with us this weekend. Susan's father has a cabin up there. But, eh, all right, well.
Actually, I never had any formal training. I guess I'd be better suited for improvs, or something..
(to the saleswoman) You know honey for an unadvertised sale, you're doing a lot of yapping about it.
Yes, well, if you had never taken your keys back from Kramer, he never would have taken his back from you and given 'em to me, in which case I wouldn't have had to take mine back from her.
(on tape, singing) "Believe it or not, George, isn't at home, please leave a mes-saaage at the beep. I must be out or I'd pick up the pho-one. Where could I be? Believe it or not, I'm not hooome." (beep)
Really? And Debby told me that she fell in love with him because he has all this perspective!
Then why don't you try and get him another job?
All right, so what's the penalty here? Let's just pay the fine or something and get the hell out of here.
A drafty apartment? A... sweaterless friend? A ball-game giveaway Metlife windbreaker?
Huh, he's a communist. . . . Look at this. "Exciting uninhibited woman seeks forward thinking comrade and appearance not important." . . . Appearance Not Important! This is unbelievable. Finally this is an ideology I can embrace.
My father had a car salesman buddy. He was gonna fix him up real nice. Next thing I know, Im gettin dropped of in a Le Car with a fabric sunroof. All the kids are shoutin at me, "Hey, Le George! Bonjour, Le George! Lets stuff Le George in Le Locker!"
It - it's just that I'm here with my parents, and my mother wants me to take a civil service test - and to tell you the truth, I don't even think I'd pass it.. So..
Tell me about it. I went out with this girl last week. First I had to pay for dinner, then--
The name's George Constanza. I'm starting work here today. I was wondering if you could tell me where my office is.
This is George Costanza, I'm calling for my test results. Negative? Oh, my God. WHY! WHY! WHY? What? What? Negative is good? Oh, yes of course! How stupid of me. Thank you. Thank you very much. (he hangs up)
Hello? Amanda. Hi, yes. Listen. You know, I'm thinkin', we might just be better of bein' friends. Yeah. Yeah, you know what, I can't even really talk about it right now. Bye-bye. (hangs up) (happy with himself, but then sees the burned up photo) No! No!
It's not working, Jerry. It's just not working. (sits down next to Elaine)
(angrily)"WHY WEREN'T YOU MORE CAREFUL WITH YOUR DROOL!"
I don't think so I know so, Kramer, come here I got to talk to you
You know what, bad mistake my mistake do me a favor go back to the other lane - you'll never get there - forget this lane - y'a kn ow what this lane stinks - go back to the other lane - bad decision - go go go take this light - take this light -
Ha! (grabs his coat and exits the apartment)
Oh ya, This is my fiance, Susan. This is David
Oh of course you can use it, sure. (Jerry saying stuff through the phone) Ok, bye. (hangs the phone up)
Ha! (snort) Can you believe it? (amused) I'm supposed to be havin' lunch with her right now at Pomodoro.
You want to be with somebody that doesn't like you.
Amazing. I drive them to lesbianism, he brings 'em back.
That's a shame. (Karen is shown singing off-key on the television.)
Yeah! Yeah!..Staten Island . What about my clothes ,how do I get the rest of the clothes?
He can be pedantic. He can be pedantic.
You see those tears streaming down you don't know what to do. It was like she was on fire and I was trying to put her out.
Yeah, yeah, like it's just part of the conversation. Oh my boyfriend really likes watches. He's a real watch freak. We-e-ell that's fabulous. (snaps fingers in the air a couple of times)
All right. So, he caught me in a cleavage peek, so big deal. Who wouldn't look at his daughter's cleavage? She's got nice cleavage.
I am eating my dessert. How do you eat it, with your hands?
Yeah. Cotton breathes, you see, it's much softer. Imagine playing games and your team is five degrees cooler than the other team. Don't you think that would be an advantage? They're cooler, they're more comfortable...they're happier - they're gonna play better.
Hey hey hey, we're in a rush here.
Well, actually you did miss one nugget of entertainment. (Pause) Have you ever seen Elaine dance?
Was she uh, was she a big, uh woman?
(gets up and picks a mirror) Yes. Yes, it's white. Why it's white.
(frustrated) Ohh, I wanted to see that. (waves his arms in frustration) Thanks. Thanks a lot.
You're very good. Very good with the moanings and the gyrations. Y-You really had me going there for a minute.
I believe the doors on the bathroom stalls, here at the stadium, don't offer much by way of privacy. But I was thinking if we extend the doors all the way to the floors......
Okay, okay. Look, you do all the talking, okay?
All right, all right. Thats it. Im gonna go down there.
Oh, the hell with it. Let him kill me. I..
Pretentious? Who, who isn't pretentious? Ha, ha, if everyone who was pretentious was in a mental institution, ... uh, obviously THIS isn't a mental institution.
You can't just walk into a building and say " I wanna be a talk show host."
Well, I wouldn't want you to do that. You know there's a lot of losers out there.
That's a very good question. You know she and I go out for dinner, she doesn't even reach for the check. That?s all I?m asking for is a reach. Is that so much to ask for?
I asked if I could borrow a sweater.
I'll make time, because Abby, I was once like you; wide-eyed, naive, I didn't know the first thing about a subject as fundamental as risk management.
You don't need the cufflinks! You have the same name! (no reaction) 'Jerry'! (heads for door, grabbing his coat)
I think I saw him. I think it's him.
We sat there for twenty minutes, chewing, staring at each other in a defunct relationship.
This is very exciting! You're on the Tonight Show, NBC, who else is on the show?
I don't understand things were going so great. What happened? Something must have happened.
I don't know, maybe a safe fell on her head.
(talking to nobody) Nah. It's probably a union thing.
Gary? Well, well, well well. Where the hell've you been? I've been leaving you phone messages for months.
Who cares about eyebrows? Is she sweet? I like sweet. But not too sweet, you could throw up from that.
Great. (They both stand.) Oh, by the way, did you get a chance to read the script?
Imagine if I had to see them both on the same day? (mirthless) Haha! It's like runnin' a double marathon!
I think I was affected by the caffeine.
It's just a magnificent stone. (turns to Jerry) Jerry?
No, no, this is supposed to go to Joe Mayo's apartment.
Mmm, no. Boy, it really didn't come out too well, did it?
I'd go to prison as your accomplice. I'd have to wear that really heavy denim. Go to the cafeteria line with the guy who slops those mashed potatoes onto your plate. Go to the bathroom in front of hundreds of people.
But I'm backing in! You can't put it in head first!
Yeah. No, no, no, wait a minute, I always have tuna on toast. Nothing's ever worked out for me with tuna on toast. I want the complete opposite of on toast. Chicken salad, on rye, un-toasted with a side of potato salad ... and a cup of tea. (laughs)
Why didn't you just wear a heavier coat?
(Sarcastic) Yeah, yeah. I'm gonna move in with him. He doesn't even let you use the toilet!
What d'you mean, let 'em go? They're spending all my money.
Well that was a really stupid thing! You know what's going to happen now?
Let me ask you something. When you go into a store, does it bother you that they make the security guard just stand there all day?
I can't go out there, he knows we're friends.
(Gets up, stopping him) Woah, woah, woah! What are you telling me for? You really had me going, there! C'mon, sit down. (They both sit back down) What do you want to do when you grow up?
The Duty Free Shop? Duty Free is the biggest sucker deal in retail. Do you know how much duty is?
Yes, of course I'm taking Allison. This woman is genetically engineered to go to a ball. Tall, blonde, lithe--
We'll just take a check. (She leaves the check. George, in all his cheapness, can't help but to review the check. He finds an error) You made a mistake on the..
Apparently the Seinfelds' are too good for us. I shouldn't say anything bad about your uh your partner.
If youre having second thoughts, if you didnt want it, dont worry about it because uh, you know, I, I...I could take it, you know.
Yeah, I would. It's just, you know, I just ate a whole pot roast.
(chases after her) Wait a minute! You're--now you're getting a divorce because she's from Long Island?!?!
I saw Amy making out with your cousin Jeffrey.
All right, I made up the part about the car, but the rest is true. And he hated me anyway!
All right, all right ( Goes to the bathroom)
Yes! Yes! Everybody has to like me. I must be liked!
Ben Cantwell. 85. Huh... You think we'll make it to that age?
I was in there for two minutes. He didnt do anything. Touch this, feel that  seventy-five bucks!
Well, if he can regift, why can't you degift?
I wonder if, ah, Susan ... (picks up the phone from the coffee table, then decides not to call) No. I better just go. (claps hands) heh. All right! See ya. (grabs his rain coat from the hook by the door and rushes out)
Oh, well, don't worry about it -- he's got plenty of money. (spins his chair away from her)
Can't you think of something. Call in a bomb threat.
Can you believe he sold his glasses on the street?
No, no, this wasn't moving on. I got the hook. I wish I could get a lesson in that.
What, he can't jump out of the chair? How long does that take? Here look at this. (he moves to the end of the booth) Here, watch. (stands up) Criminals. Boom. I'm up. (pretends he's shooting) Stop It! Stop It! Stop It!
I mean, I could understand if there was something else playing, but it's this or nothing.
Oh my God, an affair. That's so adult. It's like with stockings and martinis, and William Holden. On the other hand it probably wouldn't cost me any money.
It was more like a full bodied dry heave set to music.
Really? (Jerry shakes his head) Maybe this will become like a cool thing, living with your parents.
I show up. I pretend I have the job. The guy's on vacation. If I have the job, it's fine. If I don't have the job, by the time he comes back, I'm ensconced.
And I can make a left turn from the right lane too.
"It's the Kom Pau ... George likes his chicken spicy."
It's a pot pourri. May I, uh, may I show you the master bedroom? (they leave together)
(enthusiastic) And, you know, I do a lotta business with Japanese TV. They broadcast a lot of American baseball. They got an office here in New York!
What are you talking about? (Jerry grins) You're not!
This woman drove us out of our minds
Ho, ho, ho! Hes got a live one. Hes just reeling his big fish in!
I still won't be able to forgive myself - but at least it won't be about this.
If anybody should be getting more it's you.
(laughing) You think you're going to the other side with "Hi"? You're not going to make it.
What's it gonna be? ... You hear that?
I know, I know. Kind of a cute Nazi though.
Yeah, it's me sir. It's been a harrowing few days. uuh,After the car accident, I-I crawled into a ditch, and managed to survive on, grubs and puddle water, until a kindly old gentleman picked me up.
I heard what you said "Sharon, are you there?".
Ohh.. Paco! (Flicks rubber band tward the kitchen) Hey, take a look at this. (Hands Jerry Kruger's check)
Here. Let me take your tabe downstairs for you.
And a guy will appear from out of nowhere. I say "Get out of here! What do you want? You don't belong here!"
You have any idea how fast these things deteriorate when there's an 'I love you' out of the bag? You can't have a relationship where one person says, "I love you", and the other says, "I'm hungry. Let's get something to eat.".
Why would I spend seven dollars to see a movie that I could watch on TV?
(Eating) Oh yeah. These are fantastic, fantastic. (To server) You know, I'd love to get a jump on the next batch, where do you come out? (Server leaves) (To Anna) She's been ignoring this section all night. Quesadilla?
Oh leave Jack alone. Jack's got enough problems. I'll just take the small office.
Yeah. I did some shopping. Some new clothes shopping. (turns to a man) Can I borrow your menu?
Well, a lot of people keep popcorn in the house.
Alright, now. What mood am I in, what mood am I in?
Ill eh, Ill just have a bowl of chili.
They're men with jobs, Jerry! They wear suits and ties. They're married, they have secretaries.
Is there a meal allowance? What about seat assignments? Could I have the Kosher meal? I hear the Kosher meal is good. And I need clothes. Gotta get a haircut. Gonna have to, I have to refill my allergy medication. Oh, do I need a hat? I need a hat, don't I? Could we do the Universal tour? They have that Backdraft exhibit now, that looks very cool to me...
So do I, but I wouldn't hang it on a wall.
Wait, have you ever seen him throw up?!
No, not really. I'm just saying this to you because I like to hear myself talk. Yes, really!
No, you're gonna sit down, you son of a gun...
This thing can't hurt me, can it? I mean, it is a laser. What if it hits my eye?
Oh my god, maybe Gwen saw it. Maybe that's what did it.
I told her we'd all go out afterwards, okay? And don't applaud when she stops playing the first time. It's not over yet.
We could build a cabin like (Snaps) that.
Oh no, I can't do it. I-I'm not good at these things, I get flustered. Once I tried to bribe an usher at the roller derby, I almost got arrested.
Well she was sending out our wedding invitations.
She calls you today and she doesnt make a plan for tomorrow? What is that? Its Saturday night!
I can't tell ya how much I appreciate this.
All right. I'm gonna try givin' them fifty-five dollars each... (to Elaine) What do you think?
(signs) Sorry. (expectant) You're sure, uh, there isn't anything else?
I've been to a few of em. If you uh start to get woozy later, which is quite common, stay close to me. I'll get you through it. (chuckles)
(Snapping) Is that important, really? What is this, a police investigation? The woman's been through enough. She has to relive the experience now?!
(Still holding the note) I think I'm having a heart attack.
Sorry. I'll just go back to my usual routine.
There was a woman, Audrey. She had a very big nose.
I know. This was like a record. My previous record was when Joni Hirsch asked me not to tell anybody that we slept together. Kept a lid on that for about 28 seconds.
(looking uncomfortable) Um... yeah! Sure, sure I'm interested.
Well, this is a lovely apartment. Lovely! My kids are gonna go crazy. I, uh, I wonder if I could see the bathrooms. Preferably one with some paint thinner and, uh, some rags?
Yeah, yeah. That's how they talk in the major league. (laughs)
I can't go in there. Im too uncomfortable.
Love to! (Cracks his knuckles, then winces under the pain)
You'll have your turn! The truth must be heard. (Plays back the tape.) That's all there was. And yet, it speaks volumes. A low rumple. A metallic 'squink.' A 'glonk.' Someone crying out..."Dear God!" Let's start with, uh...with you, Wyck.
It's right in the explosion scene. So if you could just...leave me a little window. You know, my, uh, my aunt had a thing removed with a laser. All right, I don't want to interrupt your meal, so...
"Ah! your just mad 'cause we beat ya."
You gotta look at this. I pulled it in perfectly equidistant from the car in front of me and the car behind me.
(looking at the door) He's starin' at us.
Uh-huh. And how much does the healer charge?
Hey I get a free trip to Paris, I go in the Big Brother's Hall-of-Fame, I mail my own postcards.
No! No! Turn it off! No feats of strength! (Gets up and starts running out of the coffee shop) I hate Festivus!
Yeah, yeah, the flower guy. Listen, I know this all sounds a little crazy, but...
Alright, let's just examine the situation for a second. Who, in this situation, would be more likely to make a mistake? Me, who had access to my wallet, knew exactly what was in there? Or you--
The... drivel... parts. Oh my gosh, I just realized  I have to make a phone call. I-I cant believe- Would you-
I should've hit the little son-of-a-bitch. I can't stand kids. Adults think it's so wonderful how honest kids are. I don't need that kind of honesty. I'll take a deceptive adult over an honest kid any day.
I'll tell you what that is - that's a violation of club rules. Now I got him! And you're my witness!
Well, I'm doing it, Jerry. I'm buying the Frogger machine. Now the torch will burn forever.
Your clothes smell just like Pisano's. There's another Italian place on Jerome. Maybe I can fool him.
Oh, he'll be here. By the way, Elaine, (reaches under the table and brings out a large coffee machine) thank you for laying out for the Arabian mocha java.
I am. Im a nice guy. And she seduced me! We were in my apartment, Im sitting on the couch, shes on the chair. I get up to go to the bathroom, I come back, shes on the couch. What am I supposed to do? Not do anything? I couldnt do that. I wouldve insulted her.
Yeah, it bothers me. Doesn't it bother you?
(Takes it and throws it out window) Get outta my way!
Yeah. Actually it was in gym class. I was trying to climb the ropes and Jerry was spotting me. I kept slipping and burning my thighs and then finally I slipped and fell on Jerry's head. We've been close ever since.
Me? No, no, I don't, I don't. Doing very well, very well, yep.
I just don't like the idea that any time theres a dinner invitation there's this annoying little chore that goes along with it.
(little worried) Coffee? (thinks) I can beat that. Move in with me.
These are not "scraps." These are historic remains of a once Great Society of Hair.
Just need to uh, to dig 'em up.
Its called Sendrax. Theyve got some new kind of technique for televising opera.
Oh, Hey, eh, there's a spot right in front of the liquor store. You see
Hes a cube. Anyway, he got married six months ago. He told me ever since hes been wearing a wedding band, women have been coming on to him everywhere he goes.
how did I know you were here? Something drew me here. This is phenomenal.
You know what I would like to do? I would really like to have sex with a tall woman. I mean really tall. Like a like a giant Like six five.
I've had bedroom naked, I've had walk-to-the-bathroom naked... I have never had living-room naked.
Well, Im going with him. Id like to... Ive never done a solid before.
No no no, he's not getting away with this.
She's stickin' it to me that she makes more money than me.
Im outta the picture. I am outta the picture. (laughs) Its only a matter of time now.
Well, she's smart. You take my word for it.
Wait a minute, she did a skin cancer screening at Peterman?
(Obviously knows that, but pretends he doesn't) What, tonight? Now?
Why don't you think before you do something?
I tell you what, you give me the twenty, and I will buy *you* a popcorn and soda, and I'll throw in a bon-bons.
Every night at six-thirty. The nurse was gorgeous.. then I got a look at the patient.. (Laughs, then snorts) I was going nuts.
No! (The salesman walks away. He addresses the mechanic through the doors window) Hey! Hey! I see you! That is my Twix! (The mechanic eats the last of the Twix, obviously to make George even more angered. It works) Oh, ha, ha! Ho, ho!
You know how hot it gets there? Like 150 degrees. Your skin is gonna be simmering with boils.
I've been doing a lot of thinking. This might be my chance to start giving something back.
The parakeet in the mirror. That's a good one, Stu.
40? I'm payin' 60 to my maid. She doesn't do laundry and I'm gettin' nothin'. All right. Once she pinched my ass, but I don't know what that was.
(trying again with Glenda) I'm gonna count to three. If you don't give up the chair, the wig is coming off.
Yes, but I still don't feel right about letting you into Kramer's apartment without his permission.
I don't want hope. Hope is killing me. My dream is to become hopeless. When you're hopeless, you don't care, and when you don't care, that indifference makes you attractive.
Puke! That's a funny word. Puke. (laughing) Puke! Don't have to think about that.
What, you think I'm going to repeat the whole thing now?
This is the life! Isn't it, huh, kid?
How are we gonna get out of here? They'll kill us!
I can't believe what's happening here. She hasn't taken her hands off me all night. She was always friendly around the office, but that was it.
They got a new intern from Francis Louis High. His name is Keith. He comes in Mondays after school.
I can't believe they actually found your stolen car.
Hey, what about this? I'm in a car accident. The motorist is uninsured, you with me?
I get the feeling when lesbians are looking at me, they're thinking "That's why I'm not heterosexual".
So, I am have to going to break up with you.
You think she thinks I have a beautiful face, or is she just saying that?
Oh, no. No no no no no. Id have to advise against that. What, do you know this woman a month? Lets see, youre going to be with her seventy-two hours. Thats a dating decathlon.
Specific, Ah, lets see. I've walked in and out of so many buildings they all .. blend in together, I uh, ..
(Pleading) Please, please, they're gonna hit me! (Attempts to grab Helen's purse, she starts hitting George defensively, he backs off)
No. (dips the chip) You dip the way you want to dip...(bites the chip) I'll dip the way I want to dip. (dips the chip again.)
No, don't say a word. If she thinks my friends are jerks, then I'm a *jerk*...
My father wears his sneakers in the pool! Sneakers!
Yeah.. yeah, we're - we're cool. (Knocks lightly. Kramer takes charge by knocking on the door louder. The busboy answers) Uh, I'm sorry to bother you, I was in the restaurant earlier and I was wondering if I could talk to you for a few minutes about what happened. (He gestures for them to come in. They obey) I hope I'm not interrupting anything. It's just that I think I may have - without realizing it - been responsible for getting you fired. (Nervously laughs) And.. and.. and I just want you to know that I didn't intend for that to happen.
I had a feeling you would like it. No, don't try it on now, try it on later.
What do you mean - "Not letting you?"
I can't believe I get paid for this.
Well how do you even know its hers? Maybe it belonged to Carol. Did you see a name on the tube?
Jody let's do this agian real soon (he tends his arms for a hug but she avoids him)
Yes, I will do the opposite. I used to sit here and do nothing, and regret it for the rest of the day, so now I will do the opposite, and I will do something!
Or maybe, she just wanted to go to the Tony's. I tell you what; you ask her out again. No Tony, just Jerry. That way you know it he was her dude or just some dude.
Split it. Pretty good. Talk about game six?
We talked about his new batting stance, you know, I'm not crazy about it, but I said , 'Donny, go with it 'till it stops workin'.' Donny baseball. He's a helluva guy.
I love it! This is fantastic! Look at this couch, is this velvet?!
(Defensively) You can look at them, but do NOT touch them. (Holds them out)
What are you doing?...She had those nuts in her mouth, she just spit them out.
(pointedly) Oh, I'm sorry, I require twenty-four hours notice for a cancellation. Now, as I see it, you owe me seventy-five dollars.
No difference. I could care less. She's Jerry's girlfriend.
Well what if I told you I'm thinking of moving here?
Hey, I've eaten frogs, so nobody's perfect. Anyway-
(explaining, with lots of hand gestures) Okay, look. We've never worked together on a lie. Now, you don't understand how I work. I have a certain way of working. Jerry and I have worked together a few times. He knows how I work. It's not a personal thing, y'know? We're just trying to come up with the best possible lie. That's what this is all about.
All right, I'll tell them my sister died. (Starts fake crying) My poor sister died. She was standing and then she was laughing and then they SHOT her! That's the kind of sick city that we're livin' in. They shoot you for laughing. I must go and comfort my poor family. Jerry, take me home so I can comfort my... my poor family.
How can you compare you parents to my parents?!
(panicked and rushed) Jerry! The Japanese guys had sake in the hot-tub! You gotta get 'em outta the drawers and get 'em down here, or I don't have a focus group to sell the pilot to Japanese TV!
(incredulity) Him you brainwashed! (angry shout) What's he got that I don't have?!
No, they're not funny at all. No, I have no funny friends. I'm the funny one. El Clowno.
Aw, hoh, oh Deena, thank God. (he hugs Deena) Thank God you're here. Listen, you gotta help me. You gotta tell these people that I'm okay. You know that I don't belong in here.
Well no not yet, you gotta buy french stamps (pauses) I-I'll reimburse you of course.
Yep, and the photo was all fixed and back on his desk, no thanks to you.
I need a break, Jerry, you know. I gotta get out of the city. I feel so cramped...
(Laughs) You, I guess, you don't remember me.. but we actually, kind of um.. went out.. a couple of years ago.. once.. remember?
(Smiling to himself) You don't have to worry about me. (Nodding, gloating) I won a contest.
51 people?! That's it?! I thought it was, like, a thousand!
No. But I was the only one at the table that didn't get violently ill.
I can't believe she got involved with a shrink.
Well, it's all for charity, so what's the difference.
I'm sorry, uh, it's not like I'm gonna see something I've never seen before.
The better looking they are, the faster they go! I mean, I see they out there on the street, they're zooming around, like a blur. Like they have a motor on their ass.
I'm baby-sitting! Vivian asked me to raise him if she doesn't make it.
I don't know. He can be so weird sometimes.
Oh, no, thanks. I cant drink coffee late at night, it keeps me up.
(frantic) Oh, Jerry Jerry Jerry Jerry Jerry, listen, if, if you are feeling uncomfortable about this at all, at all. Do not feel like you have to take it.
...he embibed her glistening spell...just before the other shoe...fell.
Look it's no secret what's going on between us. (to Jerry) She doesn't like me. Now Jerry if you don't mind.
I don't know. He said he wants to be my "key brother."
Ah you have no idea of the magnitude of this thing. If she is allowed to infiltrate this world, then George Costanza as you know him, Ceases to Exist! You see, right now, I have Relationship George, but there is also Independent George. That's the George you know, the George you grew up with -- Movie George, Coffee shop George, Liar George, Bawdy George.
No, that's right, I didn't. I take full responsibility for the card not being here. I, uh, . . .
Well, they get very hot in the polyester. You know, it's not a natural fibre. I think they would prefer cotton.
No, no. I just got here. A few minutes ago.
Right. I don't have it on me. Allison, this is Susan. Susan, Allison.
If my parents had a mantel, I might be a completely different person.
Um, hi, its George, George Costanza, remember me? The guy that didnt come up for coffee. You see, I didnt realise that coffee didnt really mean... well, whatever. Anyway, it was fun. It was... it was fun, so... oh boy, um, so... You call me back. If you want. Its up to you, you know, whatever you wanna do. Either way. The balls in your court. So uh, take it easy.
I was just blowin' off a little steam. So what?
Yeah, Jimmy why don't you wait outside, you know, play with something.
It's fine, it doesn't have to be about nothing.
That's really very nice of you, Eva. Thank you.
Yes, it is exciting! All right, this is gonna be my new face.
Helping people... Of course. Of course! It makes perfect sense! How could I *not* be doing this!? I am gonna help somebody, Dammit!
So you don't speak *any* English at all?
Sorry, you don't know what's going on out there! (looks at Owen) Who's he?
(to a street vender selling hot dogs) You must hate hot dogs, huh? Or else, you, uh, you really like 'em and that's why you, you do this.
(breaks a long silence) The uh, the shoe laces that you bought me, they uh, they worked out well. (thumbs up)
So, she's the loser of the group. Every group has someone that they all make fun of.. Like us with Elaine. (Jerry thinks about this, then shakes it off)
I'm sure he'll be back in a second.
Oh, you know what you're like? You're like a pathetic gambler. You're one of those losers in Las Vegas who keeps thinking he's gonna come up with a way to win at blackjack.
Let me tell you something. No one walks into a beauty parlor and says "Give me the Larry Fine."
They always make me take stock of my life. And how Ive pretty much wasted all of it, and how I plan to continue wasting it.
. . . WELL IT WAS A BIG SALAD. AND WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IS, HOW DOES A PERSON WHO HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE BIG SALAD CLAIM RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT SALAD AND ACCEPT THE THANK YOU UNDER FALSE PRETENSES - AH - AH?
(singing)  Master of the house/Keeper of the inn... (Jerry re-enters the living room and modestly models his new jacket for George. George is impressed.) This is huge! When did this happen?
Youre not getting no Drakes Coffee Cake for fifty cents. Yae, Hey, Im all set. I got the ticket. Im going to the Cayman Islands this Friday.
Still, I bet when they gave him a plane, it was a lot nicer than this one.
The point is, however it got done, it's done. So, any luck with the car?
What are you doing here, I though you were going to the airport.
Okay. Hey, you know what, maybe I should give it to my therapist to read. She's smart, I trust her.
Uh, excuse me, Wyck. Uh, are we, uh, almost done here?
She missed her period? Oh my god. I can't believe it! I'm a father! I did it! My boys can swim! I can do it! I can do it!
I kept looking at her face. Id go, Cmon, love her. Love her!
Aw great. Now the volume knob fell off
No, Can't be...For instance I remember when we first met, we had a great conversation.
So, she fell, and then she started screaming, "My back! My back!" So, I picked her up and took her to the hospital.
Maybe she wasn't! Maybe she heard the whole conversation!
(stops Jerry realizing something) Hey hey hey hey hey hey.
Hey! (to Elaine, who doesn't look too cheerful)
(grabs the phone quick) Got it, Got it,...Hello?
(Gets up to leave) Well, scintillating as always.
What? Huh, so I had it all along. How d'you like that? (snorts) I guess I owe that cashier an apology.
Yep. And it didn't take very long either.
Well, sir, I - I gave out the fake card, because, um, I don't really celebrate Christmas. I, um, I celebrate Festivus.
Well I guess that's because I wear boxer shorts.
First time in my life I've ever gotten back at someone.
But I asked you before if you had a ticket, and you said no!
(Shrugging it off) She'll be fine. I gotta go to the hospital to see her tonight.
What kind of a sick, demented person wants another person's glasses?
And that was wrong, Jerry! You simple must to apologize..
[as if the word were totally foreign] My `stub'?
"Argh!!..Anyway...Jimmy couldn't be here today so he asked me to fill in for him, and I'm sure that you'll be impressed at what can be accomplished after only a few short days of training.....yeah!"
(Munching on a hamburger) This Arbys is good.
Take it off. You're going to ruin it.
Yup, y'know, they really spruce up the apartment.
(he just took a bite of the Chinese food ) This is terrible. What is this, ginger? I hate ginger. I can't understand how anyone can eat ginger. (puts the container back in the refrigerator.)
What for? . I'll tell you what for.... for hair.
I had the perfect situation here, he was shouldering half the load.
Yes, well, if the other people in the office saw that I called an exterminator, they would just panic. Besides, this is sort of a friendly visit. Carl, right?
Oh, oh. Uh, you know. It's the damndest thing. I, uh, I moved recently and my files, pfff, disappeared. Now, I-I don't know if they fell off the truck or if there was some sort of foul play but let me tell you something. I'm not through with that moving company.
No! No. It's not good, I don't think so.
(into phone, frantic) Mister Dalrimple! Mister Dalrimple I have to talk to you!
Kramer, Kramer, I need to know if Nina is refunding.
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. All right. I don't think we're gonna have any problem with that. (chuckles nervously) Good talking to you Tom. Really.
Well, I could be a little sweetie tweetie weetie weetie.
Hey. Hey. Answer me! Come on, show yourselves!
Hey, at least I was a camp waiter.
Why? Maybe she liked me. I, I mean she was looking right at me. You know, I think she was impressed. You know, we had good eye contact the whole meeting.
Nah, it's not a good turn. December. December. Don't you think we should have a little more time just to get to know each other a little.
Maybe the baby would like to see my spot. A positive, uplifting message to start his life out with. Huh, You can still get a great space in this city - if you apply yourself.
(astounded) What? So, this is still not over?
So, what's happening with the TV show? You come up with anything?
(Once again, Identifying) The Outlaw of Josey Whales!
So what could I do? I couldn't go through with it. She threatened to kill herself.
Oh, Hey, hey, hey! That's great! That's very nice. You know we've been waiting twenty minutes for you people?! What do you think, you're Mussolini?!
Well, Marisa. See, the thing is... I'm sort of engaged.
(Apprehensively) Um. I just realized. Ya' never gave me back the change from the tolls.
I love when they touch your arm. I can't get enough of that. Why is that?
You can't handle the truth! (he salutes) (imitating Jack Nicholson [a.k.a. Col. Nathan R. Jessep], from the 1992 movie A Few Good Men)
I just talked to Mr. Kruger, he'll be down in a minute. He wanted me to take a photograph for the record.
I gotta find a way to work this out, I love that apartment. It's so cozy, I'm ensconced in velvet. You know, if it were socially acceptable--
I just pray Kruger doesn't realize that it's gone until this guy can fix it up.
I though we said we weren't going to discuss that now!
If it makes you happy, I don't focus on these things. I will tell you this Unfortunately, we live in a very superficial society. I don't condone it, but it's a fact of life.
Oh I was not. The BUBBLE BOY was tried to kill me.
Hey, grown-up. (they both chuckle, George notices Gwen enter the room) Oh my god, there she is. Go ahead, go ahead. (to the others) Let's go, let's go. All right what are they saying?
No I can't. I can't die with dignity. I have no dignity. I want to be the one person who doesn't die with dignity. I live my whole life in shame. Why should I die with dignity?
I forgot to ask you; how did the revenge date go?
I lost them. I can usually come up with one good comment during a meeting but by the end it's buried under a pile of gaffs and bad puns.
Fine. (hits his arm on the desk) Ow!
(shifty, avoiding Jerry's eyes) Fine, fine. (he removes his coat)
You think I should come clean? What d'you think, you think I Should confess?
(Complaining) I can't read it. I need my glasses!
Ha! Ha! Hey! (moving his arms like it's so great to be all here)
I mean we can put a man on the moon but we're still basically very stupid. The guy who's car this is? He could be one of the guys that built the rocket. You see what I'm saying?
Well, I started to tell her and then all of the sudden, for some reason, I just burst into tears.
Eat me alive, huh? We'll see who can make it in *this* town.
Severance package...The Yankees are giving me three months full pay for doing nothing.
(coming back to the table from the bathroom) Oh uh. You ready?
And she loved me. Hoo, ho, she really did.
Oh, o.k., yeah. Where am I gonna park here...? (Pulls over.)
Well nothing. I didn't actually say that. (Karen is still laughing)
So, that's it. All of my darkest fears, and... everything I'm capable of. That's me.
We did a crossword puzzle together, *in bed*. It was the most fun I ever had in my entire life. Did you hear me? in my *life*! Y'know?
I tell you something. I wish there were pig-men. You get a few of these pig-men walking around suddenly I'm looking a whole lot better. Then if somebody wants to fix me up at least they could say, "Hey he's no pig-man!"
(reading the tabs) Jerry, yours is eleven dollars.
(sarcasm) Hu-hu, like I don't know that? (excitement) My Cousin Vinnie, I love that! I, George Costanza, could be on a date with an Oscar winner! An Oscar winner, Jerry! You know what that's like? It's like if fifty years ago, someone fixed me up with Katherine Hepburn? Same thing!
I'm sorry. I can't live knowing Ted Danson makes that much more than me. Who is he?
Oh Shut up! What are you doing back so soon, anyway? (puts the tape back in it's case.)
(The damage has been done. He is slightly angered at Jerry) May I ask, what do you read in the bathroom?
Ava was one of the reasons I used to like going to work, she was a friend. Now we sleep together and suddenly, I don't know how to talk to her. Every time I go to the bathroom I pass her desk. I have to plan little patter. I spend half my day writing. Then afterwards, I sit in my office and analyze how it went. If it was a good conversation, I don't go to the bathroom for the rest of the day. I see her laughing and talking with other people, they're all so loose and relaxed, I think, 'that used to be me. I want to go back there again.'
I feel like I got a B12 shot. This is like a taste explosion!
'Scarsdale surprise'. That's the musical about that Scarsdale diet doctor murder.
Woah, back it up, back it up. Beep, beep, beep. Tractor story?
Say you go to the bathroom at two o'clock in the morning, what's the outfit? I mean, you dressing up or is it come as you are?
Jerry. Marla. (Realizing Jerry's cue) Stacey! (Walks over to Stacey)
kissed me. We both had tears streaming down our faces. I never saw anyone so beautiful. It was at that moment that I decided to tell her that, I was not a marine biologist.
(to Kramer) This man is a genius. Genius!
I wanna know what I did to this woman.
Do you ever just get down on your knees and thank god that you know me and have access to my dementia?
(Takes two oven mitts from his back pack) Alright, (puts them on) I gotta get going.
Whatever. Believe me, if I wasn't involved right now, I wouldn't mind being set up. Something tells me she's a knockout. (we see, from the camera inside the cab, George's hand waving as the cab drives away)
I told her I was out o' soda, I went out to get some, an' I never went back.
Im the judge and the jury, pal. And the verdict is guilty!
No I, I want it if you dont want it.
(on tape, lifeless) Hey, it's George. I got nothin' to say... (beep)
You would think that, but either youre born with a sense of humor, or youre not. Its not going to change even if you go from the red sun of Krypton all the way to the yellow sun of the Earth.
I guess that leaves me in the clear...
Yeah, but get this, the message said 'call me if you have the time'. Heh heh if I have the time, you get it?
So you really understand my point about building a rocket and double-parking.
(sets down his paper) So how were the eggs?
Oh yeah, but that has nothing to do with it.
I was going to, but then I found out that the auto club has this free locksmith service, so I signed up. Just waiting for the membership to kick in.
It's like I'm Neil Armstrong. I turn around for a sip of Tang and you jump out first.
She told me she wants-- (Pauses until a woman coming down the stairs passes) She told me she wants me to make love to her.
Well, losing a loved is, uh...I mean, forget about it. (Starts wolfing down the sandwiches.)
(agitated) Well, I, I couldn't come. I, I had to drive my mother to, to the chiropodist.
It's beautiful. She makes all the plans. I'm not from around here so it's okay if I'm stupid, and she knows I'm only in town visiting so there's no messy breakup
You only went in front first 'cause you saw me backing up and you didn't have room to parallel park!
but..why, it wasn't my fault, I .. you asked me a sandwich, I .. I make such delicious sandwiches Elaine
(Muttering) Susan has the doll collection.. one of the dolls looks exactly like my mother.. she likes to sleep with it.
You know, they say ostrich has less fat, but you eat more of it.
My mother loves Hampton tomatoes. She's nuts for Hampton tomatoes.
They will get a good home won't they?
That's uh, KL5-8383. Are you calling them soon because, they keep very strange hours.
All you got is instant coffee? Why don't you get some real coffee?
Hey, Cosmo what happened to your mother last night. She hung me out to dry.
The way they make 'em these days, I'll never have to tell her.
Greetings, people. Greetings. Greetings and salutations. What a beautiful day for a ball game. Let's play two! (Sits down, says to waitress ) Oh, I'll have the chicken salad on rye, my usual, you know what I get, darlin'. (Turns to the Gang) So, let's see, I had a little conversation today with Mr Don Mattingly - (to Elaine) he's the first base man.
Well? (Miranda hits George) I was just - I'm curious, that's all. We, uh. We'd like you to, do everything possible.
(To Jerry) Let me ask you something.. How much do you think it would cost to have tonsils and adenoids removed in the hospital?
Oh, I had it perfectly timed out the Grand Central, the Van Wyck! You destroyed my whole timing!
I think they really went for that Soda.
For that rent, shed take a bath in the toilet tank if she had to.
Yeah. Thanks. Hey, listen, if you ever get a date, maybe the four of us could go out together sometime.
No No I'm working on a system...Who was that?
(Frantic) Kramer, do you know what those guys are gonna do to me?!
Just..go back. Pretend the whole thing never happened.
Who goes to the Super Bowl with their mailman?!
All my life I've dreamed of sitting front row, behind the dugout!
No everything is *not* going good. I'm very uncomfortable. I have no power. I mean, why should she have the upper hand. *Once* in my life I would like the upper hand. I have no hand-- no hand at all. She has the hand; I have *no* hand...
I gotta go back to the library and talk to him. I gotta find out if I&Mac226;m the guy who ruined his life.
(yelling) Awright, let's just stay calm here! Don't get all crazy on me!
Oh, yeah. Still in good with the ground crew. (Laghs)
Listen, maybe we shouldn't start writing today. I got a lot on my mind.
What were you saying to the Rosses over there, anyway?
Knock it off, just sit in your seat over there you're distracting me. We're making incredible time here. I once went into Kennedy Airport from West 81st Street to in uh, in 15 minutes. hu uh. Oh, here hold this. It's uh, ten dollars for the tolls.
Wha - what happened? What are you doing back so soon?
Tell me your impressions, I would love to hear what a young woman thinks of "The Big Game".
That's dynamite. Yeah, I'll look for the Chinese food leftovers.
I'm grotesque . I look like a troll.
By the way, you owe me seven fifty.
You got bit by a strange dog and you didn't get a rabies shot?
Hey! Great plane! Thanks a lot. Piece of junk. You know you almost got us killed!
(As the Twix starts to move) Ha, ha, ha, ha! (The Twix gets stuck in the spindle right before falling. George begins to pound the machine) Come on! Jump!
Shes an... etymologist. You know, bees, flies, gnats. W-What about you?
Yeah, and, ... Why won't this go down?
Oh. It's just horse manure (huh huh - laughs, he points back at the horse that walked by) Horse manure's not that bad. I don't even mind the word manure. You know, it's, it's nure, which is good. and a ma in front of it. MA-NURE. I mean when you consider the other choices, manure is actually pretty refreshing.
Well it's not fair, Jerry. It's just not fair. All right, all right. That's it. I'm getting out of this thing.
(Long pause) ..Felt like it. I tell you, this doll is pretty spooky. (Takes off his glasses, rubbing his eye) It's freakin' me out man. And now I got to go back out there and pick up this doormat.
You never should have taken away his keys!
Yeah, Well that's a deal where I come from.
Jay Crespi, how am I gonna forget Jay Crespi?
I was, I had to leave. She lit some vanilla incenses. The smell drove me nuts, all I could think about was food, I had to get out of there. We need some pudding here! Pudding!
(Motioning toward waitress) I think she likes me.
Hey, hey. Kramer, what are you doing? You can't smoke in here.
I know less about women than anyone in the world. But one thing I do know is they're not happy if you don't spend the night. It could be a hot, sweaty room with no air conditioning and all they have is a little army cot this wide (Displays with French fry) You're not going anywhere.
There it is. Gate 46... We got plenty of time.
(Desperate to get rid of the book) Alright, I, I'll just take fifty. Do - do we have a deal?
This must be Sheila from the photo place.
Twelve dollars? I knew we should have gone to the bakery. I guarantee you theyre not getting no twelve dollar cake.
Hey, I just found twenty dollars! I tell you this, something is happening in my life. I did this opposite thing last night. Up was down, black was white, good was -
All I know about is sports. That's it. No matter how depressed I get, I could always read the sports section.
I don't know. I don't think you're anything.
I leave you alone for two seconds, and this is what you do! I trusted you!
Because if there's any doubt at all I...I feel we should cultivate it.
Alright, so I haven't put anything in it since sixth grade, I completely forgot about it. The State Controller's Office tracks me down. The interest has accumulated to 1,900 dollars. 1,900 dollars! They're sending me a cheque!
Lesbian wedding. How do they work bride and groom out, what do they flip a coin?
Alright, c'mon, scooch over. (Tries to squeeze into the corner seat of the couch and struggles with Remy. He spills his glass of grape juice all over the couch in the process.)
What are you talking about? How can you sit there and look me in the eye and tell that me you're not worried?! Don't you have any *sense*?!! Don't you have a brain!? Are you so completely senile that you don't know what you're talkin about Anymore!!?!
huh Kramer it's huh.. gonna be pretty dangerous up there
Yes, it is consistent. I've, uh, I've tried to maintain a consistent feel throughout the house.
You mean just going there because I'm invited, that's rude?
(pops his head out of the covers, looking a bit confused) Uh...you know, uh...pleasuring you.
I got engaged. I'm getting married. I asked Susan to marry me. We're getting married this Christmas.
(eating a pickle) Well they're his tickets, he can do what he wants with them.
All right. All right. Let's not get into panic mode! Let's not make a big deal outta this thing or we're never gonna get through this night.
Did I get him in trouble? Because of what I said?! I just told him what happened.. he didn't do it on purpose.. (Mangager and busboy are arguing. The busboy points in the direction of George) He pointed at me. Why did he point at me?!
Did you see that? The guy's walking away. What is wrong with you? That was a three hundred dollar profit.
Huh, strawberries, anyone? (eats a strawberry) Ah, that's good. Ooh, juicy this time of year.
Hey, I am not a prude sweetheart. I swing with the best of them. (snapping his fingers 5 times)
Well get it back! It's very important. (winks)
I want to know how did that get into my car?
(internally) How am I gonna get out of this? Think Costanza, think!
Sorry I'm late, but look what I found in the Yankee Hall of Pride display case.
(to Jerry) Have you seen the waitresses in there lately? I never had so much coffee in my life.
I know. It's Mickey Mantle's number. So not only is it an all around beautiful name, it is also a living tribute.
...It was all a terrible misunderstanding, sir. Just five minutes. Just five minutes of your time. (listens) Thank you! Thank you, Mister Dalrimple.
Hi, we're from the United Volunteers, we've come to pick up the TV.
Well I am actually going to have a secretary and I get to do the interview.
I'm not her boyfriend. I want to be her boyfriend.
Thats all there is to it. By Christmas day I will be Brother Costanza.
(Stern, angered) I hope so. (Takes the scissors)
Oh I would love that. You think he'd really do it?
What, are you crazy? It's a traumatic thing to be thrown up on.
What's going on? He still wants to have dinner with us?
Hey, so, did you give that radio the old switcheroo?
Yes a cruise, a long cruise, just the two of you.
I got me an appointment with a hardware store. I'm not saying I want to do it for the rest of my life, but, uh, hardware fascinates me. Don't you love to make a key?
(excited) You're saying I stand to inherit three hundred thousand dollars, is that what you're saying?!
Let me digest it. Let me get my money's worth. Y'know what would be good is if there was someone else in the bathroom that could tell me.
That's not funny. So, are you coming to the party?
Are you often on business trip? Nice...oh, hey nice ice-bucket.
Yes, flowers. I will get her flowers, I will go to the florist!
I tell you, when she threw that toupee out the window, it was the best thing that ever happened to me. I feel like my old self again. Totally inadequate, completely insecure, paranoid, neurotic, it's a pleasure.
How are they gonna make that book into a movie?
You're cutting me off? No, no, no Jerry, don't cut me off!
Well, people never give a good 'hello' at a funeral. I mean, they go like this (George gives an extremely understated nod) That's the biggest.
How about the old Spider Man live action show?
Where's the luck? There's no luck. 1,900 dollars down the drain.
Cmon, go for twenty-five hundred. Well do it together. Come on, come on. Were in it together.
He frolfs, he scores...(he drops one invitation on the stairs.)
Well it's not up my alley! It's one thing if I make it up. I know what I'm doin, I know my alleys! You got me in the Galapagos Islands livin' with the turtles, I don't know where the hell I am.
This is dating , you can't leave anything to chance.
I don't want to! I'm outta money! I got 714 dollars left in the bank.
Oh with all due respect, I went there too, and I work for a team that just won the World Series.
Wait a minute Jerry, there's a bigger issue here. If you go through that wall and become one of those guys I'll be left here on this side. Take me with you.
Okay, uh, eighteen dollars, and there it is. There you go. So maybe we could get together this weekend.
Yeah, yeah. Just delivering some presents to my folks.
Well I guess that's because I wear boxer shorts.
Oh now you're gonna go? ELAINE I'll be back in five minutes.
All right, listen, I'll see you guys later.
Yeah, the super glossy. The best they had.
Don't you see what this says? How can you possibly like somebody ,if you think they look like this?
(In a state of hysteria) I'm an eggplant! I'm an eggplant! I'm a minstrel man!
So the Wig master.......the Wig master said you could stop by the theater tonight.. and he'll show you around.
You're not out there! You can't be, because *I* am out there. And if I see *you* out there, there's not enough voltage in this world to electroshock me back into coherence!
Well, I can't walk anywhere now. I'm just gonna be wishing there were walkways. (seeing Elaine removing her shoe) What are you doing?
Hehe. Well, I got my triangles. (sitting on the couch)
But Kramer, isn't it a question of hygiene?
oh, . . .because she handed you the bag. I could have handed you the bag. She happened to pick it up at the restaurant even though, . . .
Me? It wasn't me I never even saw the ball. All you do is dribble.
(Whispering to Jerry) What time is our flight back? I got to go to the bathroom.
Ohooo what are we going to do? I'm shaking! I'm shaking!
I'm engaged to Mr. Ross' niece. I'm probably gonna be taking over this whole place someday so if I were you I would stay on my good side.
Really? My father has a ton of old clothes just sitting up in the attic, y-you think they're worth something?
I don't believe it, what did you say?
Well do you want me to take it off?
I'm not giving you the satisfaction. I'm gonna watch it again...
And then, then, then she leaves with somebody else! Never even, never even said goodbye! Never called me back.. Never apologized. Nothing. Like I was dirt.
So call her up and tell her to bring you another one. She'll be delighted to talk to you.
Because! Because, as the leader...if I die...then all hope is lost! Who would lead? The clown? Instead of castigating me, you should all be thanking me. What kind of a topsy-turvy world do we live in, where-where heroes are cast as villains? Brave men as cowards?
What a bald paradise that must have been. Nobody knew.
This catalog is all about how to score in a foreign country.
This is a fantastic place! I always thought it was a meat packing plant!
Well, Jerry. There was a pretty good chance I was never gonna have sex again anyway.
Oh, I'm goin' baby. I'm goin.' (Heads for the door, then stops.) It's Jerry's fault. He took out all my good lines. He's such a control freak!
And I cancelled plans to go to the movies with them tonight.
Now I know what I am supposed to do. It's so simple. Tell the truth That's all. Just tell the truth
She said she liked me. No kiddin' she said that?
(Places the doll presumingly where it belongs on a shelf) Ya?
(Still on the hot water) What about shaving?
Okay, how about this? All right, we get married March 21st, the first day of Spring.
No, it's a Newman. Well, I gotta run. (Smiles, pats his briefcase and exits.)
And how does the baldness fit into that plan?
They wanted to read a Truman Capote book.
You know the anxiety you feel on a date? That's what I have every day now. My worst nightmare's come true, every day is a date.
(to himself) A cane. I knew it. (to Neil) So, we meet at last. I admire your skills, Mr Peanut.
(distracted) Mm? (acknowledges Katy) Oh, hi. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. We met uh, skiing that time. You're uh, married to the eye guy.
No, I would have picked up on it. I can always tell when a woman likes me, they always somehow let you know. With me, they could torture me, I wouldn't tell them. If anything I'd try to make them think I don't like them, then they think, "Oh, look at this guy, he's not even looking at me, he must have something going for him."
They should call it round tine. You know what I'm talking about.
(Looking at his finger) I think somethin bit me. I just need another nickel.
I didn't shave this morning. I don't feel like myself.
No, no, no. Just lately, I've been thinking a lot clearer. Like this afternoon, (To television) what is chicken Kiev, (Back to Jerry) I really enjoyed watching a documentary with Louise.
So, what? We're gonna do nothing now, this is crazy.
Cancer? Is it cancer? Do I have cancer?
Well let me hear....( they struggle for the headphones)
Me either. Is there anything you can do to shut them up?
A-and don't settle for 145, you can do better, you're a genius. Heheheh (laughs)
Yeah, yeah, me to miss -- I miss.
He purposely mispronounced my name. Instead of saying, "Costanza" He'd say, "Can't stand ja". "Can't stand ja" ... He made me smell my own gym socks once.
(getting animated) Look I, I uh, I had nothing to do with this. It wasn't my decision. It was Jerry! Jerry told me no. I'm the creative guy. He handles the business end.
What's to think about? If Putty says it's what it is, it's what it is. He's not gonna cheat you.
Well why couldn't you include me in your excuse?
I was supposed to see her. She wasn't supposed to see me.
Well, you didn't hear it from me, but needless to say, if you go in there - stick with the consumee.
Maybe it's not even stupidity. Maybe it's just a blatant disregard for basic human decency. Yeah this how dictator's start. Do you think Mussolini would circle the block six times looking for a spot?
(to Elaine) Right, alright. (to Jerry) Oh Jerry, do you have any apples?
I would give anything to be going up those stairs again.
No, stings the throat. Anyway, so I was coming along here, and I felt like a piece of cake, you know? But then I thought, it's morning, I should really have a muffin. I like those chocolate chip ones. Then I figured, well, they're really both cake. So I, uh, I sat on that bench for a little while, twenty minutes or an hour, and then I figured, check and see what you were up to. (a thought occurs to him) Wait a minute, wait a minute. The broad jump! The broad jump over the pothole on Eighty-sixth Street!
No one's putting a gun to your head. Do I, uh, scare you?
Yes, it was purple, I liked it, I dont actually recall considering the buttons.
Its Martine. I think hes dying. He tried to kill himself with pills.
(knocking on the counter and feigning a muffled, Chinese voice) Chinese food!
Yeah, I'm a great quitter. It's one of the few things I do well. I come form a long line of quitters. My father was a quitter, my grandfather was a quitter... I was raised to give up.
(pulling out some money) Uh, yeah. Hang on. Just... yeah.
Never! It is a part of me. I will just return the chair, and it will be easy, because the receipt is in my good friend.
You never run out, do you? (Jerry smiles.) Where's Kramer? Everything's finished here.
Are there terrorists on the plane? A hotel fire. Is that it? Malaria? Yellow fever? Lupus? Is it Lupus?
Well, I'm sure at some point between the years 800 and 1200--somewhere--there were two women living together.
Jerry, it's fantastic. I love the people over there. They- they treat me so great. You know they think I'm handicapped, they gave me this incredible office, a great view.
You're telling me. (he walks around and the suit makes a swooshing sound) So, what do you think?
I guess she did. He's gone, now I'm the man.
(Takes a few seconds to mull this one over. Shooting Jerry a confused look, he repeats it) "The panties your mother laid out for you"? (Jerry nods) What does that mean?
Well I I ..put a lot of thought into this and I think I would like you to sign a prenuptual agreement.
That?s not the issue, we're friends, if I?ve got to be uncomfortable, you've got to be uncomfortable too!
(swerving) Hey! Watch it! Did you see that guy? He just gave me the finger!
Yeah, I think I got a touch of something, too.
Well, it's . . . much too low.
You know, Ive been thinking. I cannot envision any circumstances in which Ill ever have the opportunity to have sex again. Hows it gonna happen? I just dont see how it could occur.
How could it still smell after all that?
I bawled uncontrollably. I just poured my guts out. And I'll tell you, Jerry, it was incredible. I never realized how powerful these tears are. I could have postponed it another five years if I wanted to.
I love that bathroom. It's got that high, high toilet. I feel like a gargoyle perched on the ledge of a building.
What do you mean "might"? You don't think he really owned this car?
(Laughs) Steven, nothing is higher than an architect.
I'd like to say it once to someone that can actually hear it!
Besides, Steven Koren has the highest of aspirations. He wants to be (pauses for effect) an architect.
( to Jerry) What about the letter, should I think about the letter?
Whatever. (George looks to the table) Hey new tape recorder?
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. It's from that grapefruit that Jerry squirted at me.
That reminds me, I'm not getting you guys any more fruit. That guy was eyeballing me the whole time. He gave me the creeps. All right, you owe me twenty-eight sixty.
Look, I'm doing you a favor. They're having an unadvertised sale. This suit is gonna be half-priced starting ... Monday.
Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot. I'll pay you back.
[to himself] Oh, my God! It's Susan! What do I do?
I, I really should go home. Ya.. actually I'm planning on spending the day with my father tomorrow (short laugh) we're uh we're going to a father-son picnic, just the two of us.
Hid? I have no idea how this suit got misplaced. Nevertheless, I do believe I shall purchase it.
Yeah, look at me. Now I GOTTA FIGURE OUT THE HAT SIZES OF 59,000 DIFFERENT PEOPLE!! WHAT IF A PINHEAD SHOWS UP. I GOTTA BE ON TOP OF THAT.
I gotta get to Fowler. I know that he would take this squirrel off my hands. It's practically bionic!
Well, I'm also an architect. Is that pastrami?
Somebody double parked and blocked us in. D-DOES ANYBODY KNOW WHOSE CAR THAT IS? Maybe there's a note on it. Ohh-oh brother. No, no note. Can you believe this?
Look at me! I am man! I am you!
What about me? I was a total failure. Everything was fine. Now this thing's gonna be a success and God's gonna give me a terminal disease.
I think it moved. Oh my god, I think it moved. Yeah, give me the big piece. I'll see you later.
Well, you should always consider podiatry. (Patting Ricky on the shoulder) There's nothing wrong with the feet. (Ricky looks critically back at George)
Now, if this mechanic guy, was, in fact, eating a 5th Avenue bar, as he claims, wouldnt you agree he would have no problem picking one out from a candy line-up?
(thinking of the moans) Heh. (Karen takes another puff of her cigarette) You seem like you really enjoyed your Risotto. (chuckles) You have a very contented air over there. (chuckles again) You look very contented, very satisfied. (pauses) Are you satisfied?
Yes. Yes. You know what's interesting. The quarterback for the Atlanta Falcons is Bobby Hebert. No "r" which I find fascinating. You know it's Herbert h-e-r-b-e-r-t, Hebert h-e-b-e-r-t. "Hebert" it's a fun name to pronounce. Try and say it Hebert. Take a shot. All right. (check arrives) All right. I
"I have to go see Steinbrenner later. Mr Wilhelm told him that I was the one responsable for stealing all the merchandise."
I'm not getting on a regular plane now - I'm all psyched up to go on a private jet. No way I'm getting on a regular plane.
So I finally stop and say, "Tatiana, I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but I think it would be best if I left".
Does she care? No. Does anyone ever display the slightest sensitivity over the problems of a fellow individual? No. No. A resounding no!
Why, you think you can, beat me up?
Why don't you find a doctor that doesn't know your difficult.
Plans. Schemes. She ah, she keeps talking about getting back together with her old friends, you know - "the gang," as she likes to call them (chuckles), you know. Yeah, they're eh, they're hatching something, you can count on that.
It's two completely different sounds. "ih" and "eh".
This hat just bottles in the heat, I -I don't even need a coat! It's unbelievable!
"Yeah,yeah yeah yeah! I've seen these.....they sorta ..they make your legs..stronger."
And then, (Smacks the money) there were two.
I bet they're probably doing summersaults about us over there. You think they get butler stories like that everyday? (He calls Susan)
Pretend you didn't know it was there. Can you see it?
Well, it's this little place with this little bathroom. It's like right there, you know, it's not even down a little hall or off in an alcove. You understand? There's no... buffer zone. So, we start to fool around, and it's the first time, and it's early in the going. And I begin to perceive this impending... intestinal requirement, whose needs are going to surpass by great lengths anything in the sexual realm. So I know I'm gonna have to stop. And as this is happening I'm thinking, even if I can somehow manage to momentarily... extricate myself from the proceedings and relieve this unstoppable force, I know that that bathroom is not gonna provide me with the privacy that I know I'm going to need...
So you don't think she really has a boyfriend?
I don't see why's she more self-conscious about that than her toe thumbs.
I think I'll have a piece of cake.
Absolutely. Because instead of doing a wash, I just keep buying underwear. My goal is to have over three hundred and sixty pair. That way, I only have to do wash once a year.
Now I remember, as I jumped over the hole I heard a, like a jingling sound.
Wait a second, wait. Why are we together?
I think Im getting tired of it. I mean is that all it does? Hello? La-la-la?
You-you sure you never slept with her? (Jerry shakes his head 'no') Perfect.
No, no. It wasn't a shift, I've shifted, this was a move.
Uh, heading out. Jerry really hates to miss the coming attractions.
Payroll project. Wilhelm? Big uh, big payroll project.
One mile from the exit it starts shaking, really violently shaking, like it's having a nervous breakdown. It completely stopped dead.
I look like me and I'm working from the outside. Who do you think is in the better position?
No. I need a guy that can rig a Frogger machine so that I can move it without losing power, 'cause I have the high score. H-hello?
Yeah, but they let me go on and on all about the Hamptons, they never said a thing! You don't let somebody lie when they know you're lying. You call them a liar!
Yeah! like the big toe is like the captain of the toes, but sometimes the toe next to the big toe gets so big that there's like a power struggle and the second toe assumes control of the foot.
No keys. And I been calling the city all day. Course there's not really a number to call if you wanna make a pothole.
I really can not comprehend how stupid people could be sometimes. Can you comprehend it?
I really don't think we're supposed to be talkin' about this.
You know, about how when you break it down, it's really a very positive thing. you know, you have a nure, with a ma in front of it. MA-NURE. Iz not bad.
Its been a long night. You go home and get some sleep.
I don't think so, Vic. I've done my homework. '89 Volvo, that's the car for me, it's the one I want.
(thinks for a second) I got used to it.
Yeah, like he was really gonna take your money.
I was moving it across the street, I looked up and I saw Woody Allen and I got all distracted.
I knew this was gonna happen some day. It was inevitable. I've known it ever since I was a little kid. I've been waiting for it.
I'm George. George Costanza, you live around here?
Yes, for a sales position. Latex salesman, the selling of latex, and latex related products. They just wouldn't give me a chance.
Yeah. What are you doing with the Daily Worker?
(standing up, still acting) Uhh! I'm caught in my own web of lies! (holds his hands up in surrender)
Well, I think you should drop him down to Step Two.
She kept such a nice clean apartment. She was so sanitary.
That's okay. That's good. You think Louie Pasteur and his wife had anything in common? He was in the fields all day with the cows, you know with the milk, examining the milk, delving into milk, consummed with milk. Pasteurization, Homogenization, She was in the kitchen killing cockroaches with a boot on each hand.
You know, I could have actually gone to that.
I can't believe you're really going out with a woman named Lois.
Because my parents happen to be two pretty wonderful people.
The table, the stereo, the VCR, the velvet couch, where's the velvet?
We got a soccer game in Chile. Anyway, the plane crashes. Who are you gonna eat to survive?
(grateful, relieved) Thank you! I'm gonna make you both so happy!
He never finished the sentence. He got a call, that was the end of the interview.
What the hell are you two talking about? (All exit)
Um, you know Im starting to think that maybe lobster isnt the way to go.
(Eating a sandwich) Oh, like you really know busboys.
(worked up) Because if she gets it back, then you'll have no reason to be sour. You'll de-sour, right?
Jerry, my vacation just started. I need a day or two to de-compress. Besides, I did plenty today.
Ah, excuse me, Vice-president Coco, no one cares about your Gammy.
They send me? Aw right ..ask 'em Does it really work?
You didn't find it funny?! This is what I'm paying for?
Ok, ok, fine! It's changed, it's not really the point. Anyway, I'm thinking of making a big move.
Dad, he doesn't need to see the pole.
me too, I am down, I am totally down, mark me down
Hey, look at this. This is the same massage chair we're gettin' for Joe Mayo, $60 cheaper.
Yeah, much better. All right, so what's the move, because I need *something*. This woman I'm dating, it's like she's doing her nails during love-making.
I thought the thing you said about the sex not being simulated . That was really funny.
All right. See you tomorrow. (George sighs, exits.)
9... 1... 1. She said she'd do anything. Hello, police? Uh, yeah listen, we're in the back of a limo in Queens--
(continuing) I feel like a family. In fact, yesterday was Grace's birthday. She's such a sweet woman so, we had a little party, with cake and champagne. I made a toast.
Well she apologized, and then she wanted to know if we could get together Wednesday afternoon.
Well you missed a lovely little party that we had for Grace.
Would you believe my luck? The first time in my life I have a good answer to the question, "What do you do?" and I have a girlfriend. I mean, you don't need a girlfriend when you can answer that question. That's what you say in order to get girlfriends. Once you can get a girlfriend, you don't want a girlfriend, you just want more girlfriends.
No, I decided to go with an '89 LeBaron.
Hey, hey, hey! It's not Lupe's fault, you shouldn't have left it out.
Yeah, and a whole new me. I'm up two inches in these babies!
What kind of a therapist are you? I'm telling I'm scared that something terrible is gonna happen to me, right away you start looking for tumors?
Didja see the way she was looking at me?
Oh, deserve! I don't know if I deserve...I mean...
I said preferably cashmere, for warmth. So in front of the whole party, he says, 'No. I don't want you stretching out the neck hole.'
All right. That's more like it. Thank you very much. (giving the sponsor the 'be strong' hand clench) By the way, my uncle was an alcoholic, so...
So you're a lawyer. What kind of cases do you handle?
Well, I'll tell you, Stacey. It's a lot of hard work. But, it comes fairly easy to me. Some people write symphonies. This is my gift. (Raises ski lift ticket while Stacey looks away)
Yeah. A couple of people. I don't get that, though. Where do you start?
Alright. 7,7, (points at himself) 6. I'm not gonna eat that much!
Well, it's a tough decision. I have to wear these every day. I'm deciding on a new face.
But Mr. Steinbrenner, how can I be expected to perform my job properly, knowing that my uh, subordinate is making more money than I am? With all due respect sir, it's outta whack.
(on the phone) Uh, Mrs. Ross? It's-it's George.
Years. When we were kids, they made it seem like it was right around the corner.
Smarter than me? I don't want anyone smarter than me.
There was an incident. I'd rather not discuss it.
That's exactly what I said, except I used the word "momentum".
I heard they found a family in your freezer
Yes, Id like to report a problem with one of your mechanics.
Oh, no no, I cant go back there. Jerry, its so awkward and, you know, it could be dangerous sexually. Something could happen, Id be right back where I started from.
Well, Tony.. took a bit of a tumble
Oh, I think that's fantastic. Good for you. Nice. That's very nice.
Im keeping it. Im going down with the ship.
Hey, I brought you some cigarettes. You buy yourself something nice.
Morgan? No. He's doing a great job. (winks)
What, you think I eat all my meals with you? (To waitress) Excuse me, sweetheart? I think you may have overcharged us. What is this?
Lemme see. I can't believe you got these for free. (Looking at the tickets) Row F?!
Because filth is good. Whaddaya think, rock stars have sponges and ammonia lyin around the bathroom? They, have a woman comin over, Ive gotta tidy up? Yeah right, in these matters you never do what your instincts tell you. Always, ALWAYS do the opposite.
It's all departures. I see nothing but departures. (to the woman beside him) Do you know where the arrivals are?
Whew! Anybody see that poster in there? That is weird, wild stuff, huh? Whew!
So it was my comment that broke them up?
Ma, will you stop?... Its just a statue!... How is it my fault?!... It was stolen. I didnt even touch it this time... Okay, fine... I dont see why this should affect to potatoes!... Okay... Goodbye. (George hangs up.) She doesnt react to disappointment very well. Unlike me.
(ahem) In this age of uncertainty and confusion, a man begins to ask himself certain questions. How can one even begin to put into words something so um (trying to think of a word)
Ripe. Boy, this Joe's got some terrific fruit.
Yeah, hell be looking at us like hes backstage at a puppet show.
Is he a clown? What, are you kidding me!?
You know what I've come to realize? I'm not just bored. I genuinely dislike her.
(yells) Wow! Who put this cup right on the new table!
So, you send me to this therapist to help me with my emotional disorders, and she criticizes our script. (Tosses the script to Jerry.) What kind of a therapist is that?
Oh, that's a dangerous fruit. It's like a weapon that thing, got spikes on the end. You can get killed from one of those things.
Because ballpark food doesn't count as real food.
I dunno, I'm in a limo. (dials) Hello ma? It's me. Guess where I am. In the back of a limo. No, nobody died. It's a long story, I can't tell you now. Because I can't. I said I can't. If I could, I would. Would you stop it? Alright, look, I'm getting off. No, I'm not telling you! How's this? I'm *never* telling you! I don't care! No! Fine! Never!!
There's nothing I can even impart to you, that's the sad thing. It's so inborn, I can't pass it on. (begins backing into the space) Look at this guy. Are you crazy, what are you doing?! Hey! Hey, you're stealing my space!
Well, uh... come in, come, come in. (frantically clears the couch of newspapers and crumbs)
(tormented) Aw, shut up Jerry! Just shut up!
Yes, sure, surely was. Yeah, I'll remember that day. Well I'll never forget it because that was the day that I uh, lost my virginity to Miss. Stafford, the uh, voluptuous home room teacher.
( mouth full) Hi, this is fantastic ( puts the pit in the a plate)D'you ever had a Macanaw peach?
Bender? He cant play left. He stinks. I just dont see what purpose is it gonna serve your going? I mean, you think dead peole care whos at their funeral? They dont even know theyre having a funeral. Its not like shes hanging out in the back going, I cant believe Jerry didnt show up.
Yeah, the oceans really are getting very sudsy.
Probably. They all do. In my high school, half my graduating class had them. Of course, I'm from Long Island, so...
So, she went out with you on a first date.. and it was her birthday?
Demi (the "i" sounds like an "e")? I thought it was Demi?
(Interrupting) Anyway, I just wanted to let you know I'm really sorry that happened, and if I can help out in any way, I'll certainly be glad to do that. (Pause) Well, I guess that's about it.
Yeah, fun. IQ tests are totally bogus. They prove nothing.
(on phone, as Jerry gestures beside him) No, Lindsay, I had accidentally spilled coffee on the gentleman's windshield. Why would I do that? I have a job! Well, did she see a squeegee? Well, you're not going to make a dime without a squeegee. That's right, that's right, just tell your mother it was all a big misunderstanding. You won't regret it. Okay, I'll see you later. Buh-bye. (hangs up)
I'm telling you, that cashier is riding horses on my money.
Oh I think I'd go for the back.
Yeah. Hey, wait a second, you know, good news for you too. Susan's best friend, Hallie? Broke up with her boyfriend.
I got to tell you I felt terrible. I really thought she was going to collapse and kill herself.
Wait, wait a second, what are you doing?
Now, each of you is here because you're the best at what you do.
Listen to the comeback. (pleased) 'Oh yeah? Well the jerk store called. They're running outta you.'
I just thought it would be nice. A little variety.
Aw c'mon. It's a fantastic name. It's a real original, nobody else is gonna have it and I absolutely love it.
You came to see me. I work in the building.
Um, excuse me, I think you forgot my bread.
Hu, oh. No he thought I was hiding something from him about Morgan.
It's fine, we'll just meet him at the bubble boy's house.
I-I don't get these birds! They're breaking the deal. It-it's like the pigeons decided to ignore me!
Well, at least, I'm not carrying a purse.
Hey, you know what else is playing here? ``Rochelle Rochelle''.
What, is that the one your parents gave you?
Carol, thats so rude. Please, Im serious, just for a moment, if you wouldnt mind. And then well talk to Jerry.
Maybe Manya missed the funeral because she was off visiting another galaxy that day.
They're for protection, Jerry. Can you tell where I'm lookin'?
(as Jerry and Elaine continue to whine) Give it! Give it! (he finally gets the remote away from them) Pinheads.
Oh what's the difference? We'll all be dead eventually.
. . . naw, it's just you thanked HER, and and oh, . . . what's the difference?
Oh, don't look. T-This is the part where they change me.
Hey, let's turn off the lights, get some real 'movie atmosphere.'
Oh, this is fabulous. My God Elaine, you have to taste this.
But, but I'm disturbed! I'm depressed! I'm inadequate! I got it all!!
So we jump and roll, you won't get hurt.
I am not buying something just to get change.
Yes it is. She just took credit for my salad. That's not right.
You, uh, wanted to see me, Mr. Steinbrenner?
Well, I wanna talk to him about this.
Um, excuse me, I - I think you forgot my bread.
I must have dripped some on the floor and I slipped and...
You cant be serious. This is New York city. There must be eleven million decent hotel rooms! Whatta you need? A flag? (waving his handkerchief) This is the signal, Jerry, this is the signal!
(incredulous) You can't ground me, I'm a grown man.
He asked me to keep it a secret.
....But after that we really talked didn't we?
You see? We were made for each other. (Thinking to himself) It's amazing. If I reach out and touch her breast right not, she'd scream and throw me out of the car. But at this time tomorrow, I could touch it all I want.
I'm just gonna...wash. (George walks to the bathroom; screaming) WHY DID I PUT UP TWO? WHY DID I PUT UP TWO?
Can I ask you a question? Would you mind switching seats?
Don't go. Kramer! Come back. I got great news. Well, I did it.
So, if I may jump ahead - you're gonna take dog medicine?
Well, I don't see how I'm gonna make December. I mean, I need a little more time. I mean, look at me I'm a nervous wreck. My stomach aches. My neck is killing me. I can't turn. Look. Look.
The rule is a minimum of two days.
Yeah, sure, we met at Jerry Seinfeld's apartment. When you fumigated for fleas over there.
What am I going to do now? I can't live without Susan. I gotta get her back. How? How, am I gonna get her back?
He knows this guy, Wilkinson. He made a fortune in the stock market. Now hes got some new thing. You know, theres supposed to be a big merger. He wasnt even supposed to say anything. You guys should think about doing this too.
Oh, I'll pay. Half-price. Arrivederci my fellow 40-short.
Elaine, when a woman makes a Ball Entrance.. she twirls.
It's my name. I made it up. You can't just steal it.
Yeah, you know we spoke for a little bit...
(on phone) . It's George Costanza. . are there any messages for me? Why does Mr. Steinbrenner want to see me in his office? . . . Communist? I'm not a Communist . . . . All right, all right. All right, I'll be there. - ( hangs up ) My secretary Ada, told Mr Steinbrenner I'm a Communist Now he wants to see me in his office.
Wha-Is that the one your parents gave you?
Oh, the busboy left the menu a little close to the candle.
Well, it's a good looking piece of meat. (laughs nervously) Wow, this is some place. A duplex, huh? (indicating) Look at this, you got stairs in an apartment. All my life, I dreamed about having steps in an apartment. Even one step. Sunken living room. Although, one step is really not all that sunken. (tries hard to elicit a laugh)
All right, all right, calm down, calm down. Whatever happened in the past is past.
"There may be a problem with the phone, hold on"!
Do you know what happens if I miss him? I don't get credit for the pickup and I lose my 50 bucks...
That woman was unequivocally the worst date of my life.
You know, Lloyd, I-I've been to the doctor (hands George the card) there's really nothing they can do.
try shaking it...(long pause) Well,Janet should be here any minute.
I-I don't know. Last time I got the tap.
He's beboppin' and scattin', and I'm losin' it!
Ok, fine. It's going to be very interesting, very interesting if they don't show up tonight. You know my mother made all this Paella.
It's like the manager coming out and asking you for the ball.
What red dot? What are you talking about? Jerry come here for a second. Do you see anything here?
Oh no no no, if you must know, I would rather be with her than go to the game.
So, uh, how long has this been going on?
Of course. So, Im looking at it. I look up, I see shes looking at it. Our eyes lock. It was a horrible moment. I just..
Well, wha-what about the toe? What happened to the toe?
(we hear him think) My friends are idiots, she doesn't look like Jerry. She doesn't look like anybody. And so what if does look like Jerry,what does that mean?. That I could have everything I have with Jerry but because it's a woman I could also have sex with her....And that somehow that would be exactly what I always wanted.....She doesn't even look like Jerry..
(jokingly) Well, so, legally, I could marry your daughter.
Take toilet paper for example. Do you realize that toilet paper has not changed in my lifetime? It's just paper on a cardboard roll, that's it. And in ten thousand years, it will still be exactly the same because really, what else can they do?
Well, I think we need more special days at the stadium, you know? Like, uh...Joe Pepitone Day. Or, uh...Jon Voight Day.
All right, I?ll tell you what, you seem like a nice guy, let?s stop jerking around. Give me.. two hundred and fifty dollars, I?ve got people waiting for me, I've got to get the hell out of here.
You know, I cant believe youre even considering not playing. We need you. Youre hitting everything.
You want me to roll six thousand of these?! What, should I quit my job?!
I mean it's gotten to the point where I'm flirting with operators on the phone. I almost made a date with one.
What is that, immigrants come over, you show them how to act natural?
Come on. Come on. Come on. Yeah. Yeah. (grunting)
We, uh, we go on foot from here.
How could that piece of *crap* cost $98.00!?
(Asking Elaine) Jerry seem a little weird when I mentioned Nina?
If only something like that could happen to me.
I guess I should be, but Im not.
Three days. Well, maybe you caught her on the cusp of a new wash cycle. You know, she did laundry the day after she met you, everything got clean and she started all over again.
You don't have to pay for the massage?
Oh, what time is it? Eight thirty? I'll tell you what's on. You got Major Dad, Blossom, very funny programme...
Well, I'm the boyfriend. Otherwise, what's the point of being the boyfriend? This is where you have to be when you're the boyfriend.
How would you find out something like that...wait a minute, what am I thinking? I've got the entire Yankee organization at my disposal.
(from bathroom) How was Eric Roberts as the husband?
Gone. (Moves over to a chair in the living room. Kramer takes the carton of food to the table, and begins eating) The tenant association made me give it to this guy because he was an Andrea Doria survivor..
Wha..? I didn't tell you? I gotta go meet Elaine.
Hey Kramer, c'mon-- it was 240 bucks twenty years ago...
(Sarcastically) What's the competition, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang?
I know, but antiques are very popular right now.
I want you to find out is she likes me.
I can do six weeks standin' on my head. I'm a sexual camel. That's not the point. At least there was the possibility.
Yeah, hold on. I'm, uh, I'm just trying to get a reading on my dashboard compass. Where are my parents?
(To the man behind him in line) Yeah, right Im gonna get my car repaired at a dealership. Huh! Why dont I just flush my money down the toilet?
That's right. I got his whole car downstairs.
Yeah, yeah I really had some guts back then. Why don't we do it again?
Yeah, like I'm going to risk my job with the New York Yankees to make a few extra bucks. (winks)
All right, all right, I didnt want to tell you this. You wanna know why she called you?
I dont know. Just start scratching. Tell him you have the crabs. He was in the military. Hell understand that.
Fifty bucks a month, that's incredible! Okay, thanks.
No, I don't know. Maybe you haven't. You know, not everybody's seen a massage table.
Just when I was doing great. I told you God wouldn't let me be successful.
(from other room) Uh, tippy toe! Tippy toe! Lemon tree!
Oh, you haven't heard, she's going to live with her grandparents in Redding Pennsylvania.
Yes. Very nice to have had her to mention... (starting to leave)
Well, I didn't mean to hurt you kid.
Of course I'm back. Why wouldn't I be back? My mother's in the hospital, I'm going to pay her a visit.
(still looking at that picture) You know if I told my engagement story to that receptionist, but told her this, was my fiance..
It's not contest. The guy had nothing! The ship went down, he got into a life boat, I mean, come on.
The Rosses have started up a foundation, Jerry, and I have to sit on the board of directors.
What do you think? The brought it over in pieces and screwed it together like a coffee table?
Well anyway, the, uh... the stone is up, I paid my respects, guess that's it.
Boy, I wish the flamenco was popular here.
(inhales deeply) I tell you, Jerry, I'm feeling something. Something I haven't felt in a long time.
I think I could be a philanthropist. a kick ass philanthropist! I would have all this money, and people would love me. Then they would come to me.. and beg! And if I felt like it, I would help them out. And then they would owe me big time! (Thinking to himself) .. First thing I'm gonna need is a driver..
Are, are you sure this is decaf? Wheres the orange indicator?
uh, Uh, Vandelay Industries, is uh. 129 West 81st street. It's a very small industry Vandelay. It's one of the reasons I wanted to uh, work for them.
I'm a college graduate. You want me to be a mailman?
Every woman on the face of the earth has complete control of my life. And yet, I want them all.. is that irony?
I'm really going to do something with these three months.
Nose. (chuckles) What's the worst that can happen to a nose? What does it get? Stuffed? (chuckles)
Wait a minute, Rinitze? Don't they have somme really cool suits in there?
Woo! Some day out there - You ever see weather like that? Woo! It's crisp - it's crispy crisp.
Well, this is the Jerry Seinfeld that only I know. I can't believe I just told you that.
Why did France give that to us anyway?
But if you think about it...26 teams, 162 games a season, you'd think eventually an entire team would get wiped out.
So you thought she was good looking and figured this would be a good way to meet her.
I don't know, but those are my socks! I had a pair just like that with the blue stripe, and now I don't have them anymore!
The little extra moan you threw in there. Laying it on a bit thick, don't you think?
Yeah, yeah. You must have squirted a piece of pulp in it too.
All I want is my seventy-five cents back, an apology, and for him to be fired!
That's right...We just had sex......You know Jerry I've been searching for someone a long time. Well the search is over.
You ditched me. That's twice. Now I demand to know what's going on!
You know what I was just thinking -- she could really use a raise.
She tolerated the strawberries and the chocolate sauce, but eh, it's not a meal, you know? Food and sex, those are my two passions. It's only natural to combine them.
Sometimes in life, the gods smile upon you, my friends.
Step-skipper. That man is a step-skipper! He skips Step Nine!
No, I dont want it. I want it, if you dont want it.
Yeah. Hey, you know, I gotta go get these tomatoes. You wanna go for a ride?
Alright, whatever! Now. Whatever caused the damage...(drops a tiny briefcase onto the table in the model)...was jarring enough to completely stop the tape.
Maybe she could like me? Is it that far fetched? Maybe she sees something? Is it possible?
(to Elaine) Do you want us to go with you?
Yeahaha, I gave it a shot (pats Jerry on the arm)... So, any word on the "artiste"? (puts a video in the VCR)
There could be more than one O'Brien on a plane who ordered a limo.
We were expecting about two hundred people...Well...Thank you , thank you.
(smiling) Listen, I..I..I don't mean to seem forward...
Why do you have to be so suspicious of every one. This is a great man Zeng Zau, he wants to help bald people.
Yeah.. (Trying to remember) Poverotti.. Domingo.. and.. uh.. the other guy.
Yeah. And since you go buy there everyday. I was hoping that we could help each other out.
Hey, speaking of which, I found a great way to separate the skin from the top of the pudding without leaving any around the edges; Exacto knife.
(quieter desperation) They took my belt, Jerry. I got nothing to hold my pants up. (listens) Well, you gotta come over here now! Just tell 'em what we talked about, how I, how I, I didn't do the project.
I don't like it, it's red. It it's too flashy.
Toasting makes me uncomfortable. But toast, I love. Never start the day without a good piece of toast. In fact, let's toast to toast.
Boy - I'm really surprised at Elaine - that whole phone business - she should know better than that.
Ewings hurt? How long is he going to be out?
Well you know what I've discovered Mrs. Sokol. It's not so much the looking as the listening. I listen for work. And as I'm looking and listening I am also looking. You can't discount looking. It's sort of a combination. It's looking, and listening, listening and looking. But you must look.
Hey, did you see that whale thing on TV last night?
I'll call a plumber right now! (Goes for the phone.)
Hey. There is a couple of people that wouldn't mind having me out of the way.
Would you wait a second? Just wait? (They fight over it.)
(Inquiring about the chalk board) What is this?
You're luscious. You're ravishing. I would give up red meat just to get a glimpse of you in a bra. Im terribly sorry. (both George and the attractive female applicant stand up as George reaches across the desk and shakes her hand for coming in)
Oh (snorts) Articulate....Me? I've never articulated anything, i'm completely incoherent.
Well, what is that? That's a crime! Do you know how hot those things get? They should be wearing cotton.
Oh, yeah, me too, me too. Boy oh boy oh boy...! You know, in fact, I've been thinking about it, and I feel like I'm stealing from you! Five-hundred dollars! It's gonna be worth thousands soon! You know what? On second thought, I can't even accept it.
Do you think it might be possible to add a little shelf like, uh, for an alarm clock?
Well who schedules his wedding on Super Bowl Sunday?
Ive spent the last hour preparing ten candy bars with no wrappers or identification of any kind for him to select from.
I know someone wholl do it. Shes good. Shes honest.
Of course I'm all right. I'm here with my girl, Nina. And what better way to pass the time than gabbing with my best friend -- with whom there are no secrets. (Flashes two intertwined fingers) Like this. Since the fourth grade.
I have tell you, I'm pretty impressed with the first one.
She wants me to take an IQ test.
Ah, this is the kind of day that almost makes you feel good to be alive.
So the plan is to secretly sterilise her mouth?
(Opens the door, looks in and then knocks 5 times) Mr. Steinbrenner, (waves) can I talk to you for a second?
God! She's cooking dinner for God! She's yelling and screaming, and the next thing I know, she throws a big can of chocolate syrup all over my new red shirt.
I told you those trips were relationship killers. Too bad you cant get your buddy Superman to fly around the Earth at super speed and reverse time. Youd get all the money back, you could have avoided the whole trip to Vermont...
No! I am not going to see a psychiatrist!
Look, we're not gonna be that long anyway... we have to get to the "party"!
Is that what's hurting your appreciation for the story?
This is the thing where you go and you have to make your own pizza?
No, no, Kurt - wrong attitude. You should be happy now.
Susan! Jerry! Where are you? I know you're there! Answer me!
That's what nuns and Red Cross workers are for.
Oh, this is unbelievable. I'm stuck. Every time I think I'm out, they pull me back in.
Well, we were engaged to be married, uh, we bought the wedding invitations, and, uh, yada yada yada, I'm still single.
Well we were all eating the raisins. And I remember you--you were eating some of the raisins. And then you left, and the raisins were gone. And I was just wondering if, you know (chuckles), maybe you took them with you.
No good? All right, uh how about Art... Cor.....
Well a lot of people consider me small and prestigious.
What a world that would be, if you just could ask a woman what shes thinkin.
Lunch is fine at the beginning then you move on to dinner. you don't move back to lunch. It's like being demoted. I'll never do another crossword puzzle with her again. I know it.
Now if you will kindly help me unwedge my front wheel, I'll be on my way.
You can go crazy trying to figure that place out.
Ok uh, I guess I'll tell them that.
Ah, Alright, before that, I was in real estate. I quit, because the boss wouldn't let me use his private bathroom. That was it.
Well, at the Yankees it was all about smoothing things over, you know, chiseling away, grinding down. In fact we used to call it 'the grind'.
Listen, Buck, I uh...obviously I don't need to talk to you about the importance of player morale, but uh...I've been talking to some of the guys, and some of them - I don't want to mention any names - but some of them...they're not too happy with the polyester uniforms.
We are going to the Knick game! Michael Jordan!
(Nervous) Wh-what are you talking about? That - that's rediculous.
Yeah!, a doodle of me...look at the size of the nose , the ears, all my features are distorted.
You see? Now that is a handsome man. (Elaine and Jerry look right at George) Oh please.
Would you stop it. (Susan playfully bites his ear lobe again) Would you quit it please. Someone is going to see us here.
What are they doin' lettin' you bastards on an airplane? Don't they know that's against FAA regulation?
When I find that guy, this much I vow those glasses will be returned to their rightful owner.
Oh, no, no. Twix is the only candy with the cookie crunch.
Stop it! It's nothing. It's a stupid holiday my father invented. It doesn't exist!
Wait, wait, did you ever see him throw up?!
Hey, Lloyd. (Shakes hands with Lloyd) How's it going? (chuckles)
He's a jerk. (nudges to his right but no one is there)
(feeling awkward) Its uh, not bad, its comin along. Why? Did you need something.
(Reading) I see here that you play the harp.. tell me, why do you have to tilt it? Can't you just build it on an angle? It'd save you a lot of trouble.
(taking out wallet) Well, let me. Heh. Let me just eh.. check an', make sure I have the right man--ha! Heh, heh, heh! Seems--oh! I, oh! (has conveniently dropped the photo into her view)
Jerry, a throat-clear is a non-verbal implication of doubt - he thinks I killed Susan!
I have an aunt that died at seven.
I got to give the players most of the credit for that.
And ah, Ill have the bacon club without the turkey. (raises eyebrows)
I love it. New office, new salary. I'm the new Wilhelm.
No, no. No, no, no. (determined) We're staying on me. We haven't solved anything yet.
What happened to Babs. She never showed up last night. The whole thing blew up in my face.
Kramer, listen to me. I'm never gonna have a child. If I lose this Frogger high score, that's it for me.
(surprised) So, I'm Neil? How did I do that?
Every day she comes in, she sits at that table and reads. Never talks to anybody.
Mothers say things. My mother goes babbling on and on like a crazy person.
So eh, you eh, wanna get together tomorrow?
The cabin.. (Laughs nervously) Well.. (Pauses as he thinks of a way to break the news, then decides to pass it off) Susan?
What are you kidding? We look great! You know what this pudding needs? The skin on the top, you know like your mother used to make it on the stove.
Here. (panicky) We'll leave it here for you!
Well it's a little strange. You going to start to talk like Elaine from now on?
Wait a minute. I must have been winking down at the office. That's why Mr. Wilhelm was acting so mysteriouso.
Well, you could move in with my parents. (chuckles)
(to Carrie) It's just that, I know her, and boy...
And here's a roll that I think you may enjoy.
(Puts his arms in the air, stretching, and covers his mouth with an arm) Could you ask her, just ask her. If she says no, case closed.
Who are you to play God!? Every man's time comes! If his number is up, who are you to interfere!?
Ill tell you, if I was running for office I would ask for the death penalty for double-parkers. If this is allowed to go on this is not a society. THIS IS ANARCHY!
Wow. (he runs his fingers through his hair, and then brushes the resulting fallout off his jacket)
Oh, what's the point? When I like them, they don't like me, when they like me, I don't like them. Why can't I act with the ones I like the same way I do with the ones I don't like?
I was trying to loosen 'em up a little bit.
Whoop! Too late. I think he picked up the scent.
I dunno. I guess I have to wait for her to die.
No. So, tonight she's got tickets for that show she's been working on. The Flying Sandos Brother.
Come on. We got all day tomorrow to come up with a story.
Oh, my God, No, oh my God, . . . Jerry!
Just as she was. Hey, Mario! Remember us?
Just because you have someone's spare keys, it doesn't entitle you to break into their apartment. That's the reason you took away Kramer's keys.
Sounds like a scam. (takes a bite from the granola bar)
Ha ha ha ha, oh all right, go ahead, deride, deride if you must. But let me tell you something, with my personality and this set of hair, you know what I am now? I am in the game. I no longer defer to the coifed. I'm a player.
How can you call yourself a clown and not know who Bozo is?
She must have seen me eating it on TV.
Maybe I need someone who doesn't speak English.
That's where I come in. Umm, on splat. Uh, you see, Mrs. Sweedler, or is it hospital administrator Sweedler?
(Outraged. Leaving) Well, you just lost a lot of business! Because I love to read!
This you are not going to believe. Al Netchie, that pimple. Tells Daphne, not get this 'Not to get involved with me.'
(together -- with arms extended -- palms upwards) Stan The Caddy.
Oh, yes. I - I'm your baby bluey.
Hey listen... umm, instead of the movie... uh, maybe we'll go back and uh you know...(nudges her head with his head)
Really...(he honks the car and is startled, Elaine laughs)......I have to say...You were really good doing that porno thing....you're talented.
Brother Costanza will be taking the vow of silence.
I like, uh...(mutters something unintelligible under his breath.)
(Persistent) Perhaps you could look again, please? Im very hungry.
No, no, no. Out of the question. I was over there today. He's got the good spot in front of the good building in the good neighbourhood. I know he's not gonna wanna move.
Then afterwards maybe we could all go out together. Y'know she'll see me with my friends, she'll observe me as I really am, as myself. Maybe I can get some hand that way.
Well, sorry I missed that, uh, charity thing. But this was one of those truly glorious Hampton weekends that you always hear about.
Hey Elaine? Put me down for some of that art. 1,900 dollars worth.
Okay, look, Audrey, before you take the bandage off just remember that I was the one that encouraged you to do this, you know? Now that you're gonna be a great beauty, let's not forget how this all began. You know, like if you'd listened to your friend, Elaine,
I havent seen it yet, but its a two-bedroom, its on the uh, west 83rd, bout a half block from the park?
Oh, I love full lips. Something you can really put the lipstick on.
You see, this is what I do with women. I start out too strong, now I have to become real, that's when it all falls apart. What good is real? They don't want real, they want funny.
(excited) Great news! I showed the pilot to Kramer's Japanese friends. They loved it!
He's getting phone calls here now? (he's standing near the counter and eating chips out of a big bag)
And, Ill have a club soda with no ice.
I think I understand this. Jay Peterman is real. His biography is not. Now, you Kramer are real.
Alright, stop it Kramer, you're freakin' me out. (The waitress comes over.)
Whatcha got there, the 4-volt? Heh, I did you a favor.
Oh, no no no no. Go ahead, Pop, you always knew your cars.
Well, she didn't BUY the big salad. I bought the big salad.
Nothing. Uh, I don't know. I gotta go.
Why did you even take it? You broke up with her!
What I don't get is, just because the battery is dead, you think she'd be able to roll up the hill with her hands!
Pssh. Would the protg pick up stuff for the mentor?
Yeah. Where's he taking you, by the way?
What did you go out with me for?! Just to dump chocolate on my shirt and then just dump me altogether?! I don't deserve that kind of treatment! What, you don't have the common courtesy to return my calls?! To apologize! You think I'm some sort of a loser, that likes to be abused and ignored?! Who's shirt can be ruined without financial restitution?! Some sort of a masochist who enjoys being humiliated? You think you can avoid me like I have some sort of disease?! You have the disease! You have the disease! You may be beautiful and rich and physically .. just .. unbelievable, but you sicken me! You disgust me! You and everyone like you!
All right, that's enough. I gotta go home and take a nap.
Uh, good. You know, you might wanna try eating it with one of these. (Holds up lobster bib)
We all got along. Everyone seemed very pleasant.
The wedding is off. Now you can go to the Super Bowl.
Yeah, yeah. You really cashed in on that favor pretty quick.
But she's gonna know that I like her more than she likes me.
Oh yeah the nipple. But besides that. How did you feel about Kramer's work?
I never assisted in a birth before. Its really quite disgusting.
Did I tell you I ran into her last week? Ho-ho, she looked great.
Well I was just going to wander the streets. Don't wanna tag along with you or anything.
I hope so. I can't take him living with me much longer. He makes this kasha, it stinks up the whole house.
So, they didn't give you a piece of cake? Big deal.
An apartment-warming gift? We got to give presents to people for moving? Birthdays, Christmas, it's enough gifts. I would like one month off.
What? Every time I leave my house now I have to call everybody I know and ask them if they want to do what I'm doing?
My tonsils? Yeah, when I was a kid.
(energetically) "Well seems it's about time for George's lunch."
George Costanza. Susan's, uh, friend? Long time no speak.
Oh my God, I forgot to tell you. I got a letter today from the State Controller's Office. Y'know when I was going to public school back in Brooklyn, every week I used to put fifty cents in the Lincoln Savings Bank.
I dont know. All of em. Theyre all crooks! Besides, I couldnt get all different candy bars, anyway.
Okay, Okay. Who do you think you're talking to? What are ya' you trying to make a joke, because it's not funny. I can tell you that.
And I am not a piece of toast.
Maybe it's got something to do with that 42 in the corner .
No. Why must it be so difficult? Why is there all this tension and hostility? Why can't I just walk up to a woman on the street and say, "Hi. I'm
She knows there is nothing to talk about.
Are you crazy?! What are you doing?! You'll get us killed!
All right, he's letting you in. Thank you! Creep.
W--then I'm pretty much where I am now. At least I got to take a ride on a spaceship.
I'm gonna get some more of these kosher cocktail franks.. (leaves)
I thought I saw something fly over here...
Those were her exact words, I like George.
I usually spend Saturday afternoons with Susan. She's gonna want to know what I'm doing. I can't use Jerry, he's in Florida.
You don't want to suffer with this all weekend.
How so? I'll tell you how so. She's bald!
They're worse! They're much worse than us, they talk about everything! Couldn't you at least tell her about the shrinkage factor?
rush? you want a rush? drop a ball on your toe my friend, talk about a rush, you'll be throbbing, you'll see visions
(agitated) Alright, I gotta try and talk my mother into taking him off my hands.
You've got to start seeing someone else. Get out of this relationship.
Did you ever see her lose her temper. I was once late cause I bought a Panama hat -- she grabbed it by the brim, pulled it down so hard my head came right through the top of it.
Alright, listen, I'll give you your spare keys, but I don't have them with me. Can I please have mine to give to back to Kramer?
I know. That's the point. If it's gonna get sexual, it should get sexual with you.
I told her what a sexist he is. How he cheats on his wife.
(Mocking, skeptic) Yeah, you show us the 900.
They got a billion people over there and he found a relative.
What's the difference? The money is not important.
Yes, you know. Deal with it .We have to deal with the doubt, Susan The DOUBT!! Must be dealt with.
Yeah. The thing is, I, uh...I had this little zinger of my own I wanted to try.
I can't take it anymore! I'm going to work! ARe you happy now?! (Gathers his things, and runs out of the coffee shop. Elaine and Jerry laugh hysterically)
Why not? Pay is good. I got dental, private access to one of the great handicapped toilets in the city.
Yeah. (another pause) Not that I care, one way or the other, but these doctors today really do amazing things, you know, if you were so inclined. And again, I'm not suggesting.
Nah, with crutches it's a funny story, with a cane it's a sad story. You through with those?
I know. The only way to fix it now, is to get a whole new photo of Kruger.
Monica, I'm really focused here, this stuff's a killer. (turns to the next page)
I don't know how a fish could eat laughs.
Sorry? Why sorry? What you got to be sorry about?
Well, I've given this a lot of thought, and I've gotta say...
Yes. And listen to this, listen to this; her uncle works for the Yankees and he's gonna get me a job interview. A front office kind of thing. Assistant to the traveling secretary. A job with the New York Yankees! This has been the dream of my life ever since I was a child, and it's all happening because I'm completely ignoring every urge towards common sense and good judgment I have had. This is no longer just some crazy notion. Elaine, Jerry, this is my religion.
I got greedy. Flew too close to the sun on wings of pastrami.
Ah, well, you know we gotta been running because of the ...
When do you ever have ten car lengths?
(Impersonating Carson) I didn't not know that. Weird. Wild. (Susan and George both laugh)
I'm going to a poetry reading with PATRICE First time poets, in a burnt out building, down by the docks, Supposed to be good.
Are you crazy? You take your life in your hands with those nuts.
Let me show you something, take a look at this... (Another guy at the party interrupts.)
You know, I'm down to one kiss hello. My aunt Sylvia.
Excuse me. I believe you just ate my Twix bar. It was dangling. And when you purchased your Twix bar, you got a little freebie, and you never bothered to ask why, or seek out its rightful owner.
Do you realize in the entire history of western civilization no one has successfully accomplished the Roommate Switch? In the Middle Ages you could get locked up for even suggesting it!
Dark and disturbed? His whole life revolves around Superman and cereal. I convinced him to act like that so that you would think I was funnier. That's how disturbed I am! If you want disturbed, that's disturbed. You can't find sickness like that anywhere, you think sickness like that grows on trees? Nobody is sicker than me, nobody. He's pretending, I'm the genuine article.
I think I can sum up the show for you with one word NOTHING.
Two-man? It's all me. Kruger doesn't do anything; Disappears for hours at a time, gives me fake excuses. This afternoon I found him with sleep creases on his face. The only reason I got out to get a bite today was that he finally promised to buckle down and do some actual work. (turning around, George sees Mr. Kruger at a booth eating a piece of cake) Oh, I don't believe this. This is what I have to put up with, Jerry. (He walks over) Mr. Kruger? Who said he was going to do some actual work today? Who?
Told me to "Go to hell!" and I took the bus home.
Ill tell her I bumped into you, Im giving you a ride uptown.
I don't know. I do know that I have some kind of a talent - something to offer. I just don't know what it is yet!
No, no, not really. Ever since Susan passed on, I have good days and bad. (Turns the briefcase towards the woman on his left.) Some days, I'm haunted by one word - why. Why Susan? Why wasn't it me licking those invitations? Why am I still here? Well, I gotta run. (Gets up and leaves the meeting.)
Are you kidding? I lie every second of the day. My whole life is a sham!
(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o. (Hes sitting on the floor in his Play Now office).
(frustrated) No. No, no, no. You're not helping me.
Oh yes, of course, and we have to be fair. (placing the suit further away in the rack)
So, Elaine, are you going to sleep with me or what?!
(clearing his throat, he changes his order for Susan) Baked, uh, potato.
I'll tell you what I'd like to do. I'd like to replace that rye.
I never tasted a cough medicine I didn't love.
See, didn't bother Susan either. That's why I'm different. I can sense the slightest human suffering.
(not happy delivering Elaine's lie) Well, he uh, he wants to uh, quit the exporting and uh, focus just on the importing. And it's a problem, because she thinks the exporting is as important as the importing.
Great! (snaps fingers and grabs the extra plane ticket) Nina could go, huh? Jerry, this is great. You and Elaine. Me and Nina.
That's not the point. The point is I was here first.
You know what? I think this Ruthie Cohen gave me the wrong change. Didn't I pay with a twenty? I'm sure I paid with a twenty.
I knew it!! (shuts cab door) I predicted it! (hits cab roof twice, it drives off) Saw both of them today! What a disaster! I'm runnin' all over Queens. First I saw my mother. We had lunch together. Never had... LUNCH with my mother before--it's like a date! Then we drive down to Kew Gardens! Tons of traffic! I see my father. We played "Clue"! All day with this! [Kew Gardens (see links at end of script)]
Yeah, I think, you know, she was, like, crying, and he was consoling her, and then, she, uh, just got into his car, and they just drove away.
How much do you tip a chamber maid?
Sure, sure, sure, sure. (patting Jerry on the shoulders) How about these seats? Are these fantastic, huh? Huh? I feel like Lincoln.
Get out!! (Jerry gets out and George drives away. A couple of guys notice Jerry in his cowboy boots.)
It's a spanish dish. It's a moulage of fish, an meat with rice. Very tasty.
(holding his cane) I gotta hobble. (walks out)
(whispering) I can't explain. It's very important that I sit here.
Really, I was, I was only kidding around.
Wait a minute. This looks familiar. This reminds me of something. I can do this.
This is incredible! This is one of the greatest things I've ever done in my life! I'm gonna call my mother.
So, let me ask you. Do you think I could have done this?
I said, Listen Marlene, and then the next thing I know, Im in the middle of it. And theres this voice inside of me going, Youre doing it! Youre doing it! And then she started to cry, and I weakened a bit. I almost relented, but the voice, Jerry, the voice said, Keep going, keep going. Youre almost out! Its like I was making a prison break, you know, and Im heading for the wall, and I trip and I twist my ankle, and they throw the light on you, you know. So, somehow I get though the crying and I keep running. Then the cursing started. Shes firing at me from the guard tower. Son of a bang! Son of a boom! I get to the top of the wall  the front door. I opened it up, Im one foot away, I took one last look around the penitentiary, and I jumped!
Oh I beg to differ. My father took great pride in his appearance, he was a very handsome man, a casanova really.
Well, what's so great about a Mom and Pop store? Let me tell you something. If my Mom and Pop ran a store, I wouldn't shop there.
Ya gotta put on a show, ya always gotta give them a big show. You always have to be 'on' otherwise why would they like me? They'd just go for a better looking guy with more money.
(knocks on the window) Hey, why are all those people milling around my car?
I had nothing to do wtih any of this! I met all her friends, I didnt want to meet them. I kept trying to avoid it. I knew it would only get me in deeper. But they were everywhere! They kept popping up all over the place. This is Nancy, this is Susan, this is Amy, this is my cousin, this is my brother, this is my father... Its like Im in quicksand.
You see that woman on the horse? (points)
How could anybody be so selfish and inconsiderate!
[whispering] Elaine? [loud whisper] Elaine! [louder whisper] Elaine!
(to Jerry) Why dont you just turn it inside out?
(frantic by now) SHUT UP,SHUT UP, SHUT UP,...(then leaves)
As you will see, the candy bar is paid for, and yet, remains dangling in the machine. (Notices that the Twix slot is completely empty) Hey, its gone. Where is my Twix? (Quickly looks around. His sights fall on the window of a door labeled "Employees Only". The same mechanic from before is eating a candy bar) What?! That guys eatin it!
See, I think people would talk about it at the coffee machines.
(almost gleeful) After Dinkins lost the election, he had a complete nervous breakdown. They had to lock him up.
Did you see that? That-that pigeon didn't move! I had to swerve to get out of the way! I saved that pigeons life!
What do you mean, I got? You didn't give him his Visa application.
Right, I got news. You ready? (deep breath) Gary Fogel had cancer.
(MUMBLING) You come to a parking lot, you write it down. How hard is that?
You have to stand tough sir. That's why I had to hang up the phone.
That's a tough minute. It's like waiting in the shower for the conditioner to work.
(walking towards the door) I couldn't leave well enough alone?!
All right, I think they have fleas there. So what...
(anxious) I forgot who I am! Who am I?!
Five-thousand? Why would anybody buy Kramer for $5000? (laughs)
Jerry, figure this out. I'm in the coffee shop, and this beautiful girl I could never even talk to, mistakes me for her boyfriend.
Who's dressing you? (Laughs) You look like a complete idiot! You know, I wouldn't wipe my- (Unable to take anymore, Leslie gets up and shoves George violently. His hands go straight for the hot iron sitting on the dressing room table. George screams out in agony) AAHHHH!!!!! (his voice is heard outside the building, on the street, and in the park were a bunch of pigeons are scared by the yelling)
Huh-Hi. (looks around a little) Uhm, is Neil here?
Why did he tell you and not me?
He's with the touring company of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. He's the guy in charge of the wigs.
(entering) Last night, huh? Was that something, or was that something?
(a little worried) He uh, he doesn't have the auto shop any more?
All right. You wanna know what one of her favorite expressions is? Happy, Pappy?
Pull hair, Poke eyes, Groin stuff. Whatever I gotta do. (he opens a blue bottled beverage)
Your boyfriend reads the Daily Worker? What is he? A communist?
You put a hot tub... in your living room?
Hey believe me, baldness will catch on. When the aliens come, who do you think they're gonna relate to? Who do you think is going to be the first ones getting a tour of the ship?
An apartment complex, the uh the Eiffel Towers. uumm Like I said uh you'll be getting a postcard uh in a few days and again I'm sorry.
Have you seen Jerry? (sitting beside Elaine) I told him two o'clock.
(embarrassed with a touch of unrestrained jubilation) Yes.
She can't take it. It's not hers, it's theirs. Once there's no theirs there's no hers, it should be ours.
(picking up his coat) Awright, I'm heading home.
The show! Forget about the show! We should take the idea to a different network
Yeah, I should do the opposite, I should.
So what? Ill start talking to him, you know, casual, and Ill work my way around to it.
No, I was just wondering... if you guys, uh, had any gum.
(rising to his feet) Hey! Hey, you! (setting off after her) Come back here!! Don't gallop away!!
I'm sorry I'm sorry, here's the test. Thanks again for doing this - hhe.
Oh, you're fine... you're fine. (looking at Tom in the back and then quieter to Jerry) So you think this guy playing Kramer took the raisins?
Jerry, it's me, George, don't worry, I'll return it
(positive) Yes. From endorsing checks for the Super Terrific Happy Hour. (laughs)
I'll leave when the guy comes in. I gotta tell you, I am loving this yada yada thing. You know, I can cross over my whole life story. (Picks up dental tool)
OK, ah.. (George throws his keys on the table) see ya!
She's right, I heard Kramer got mugged out on the suburbs on a baby-sitting gig.
Absolutely, uh, lets see there's, uh, Vandelay Industries, I just saw them. I got very close there. very close.
No, that's my only suit. It cost me 350 dollars. I got it at Moe Ginsburg.
Mon...? No, no, I can't wait til Monday, that's impossible, I gotta talk to him now. Where does he live?
Let me just see it for a second.
No, he said there was nothing he could do, and next time I should probably break the Prozacs in half.
Because, if you ever see her and it comes up, we have to be in sync. Hmm?
"Jerry", oh my God. He wants to talk about "Jerry"?
She thinks I'm a nice guy. Women always think I'm nice, but women don'tnice.
"'Cause when he questioned me about it I was sweating from the Kom Pau.."
With all due respect, I don't think so...
Oh, sure. I mean, after all, you were almost my, uh... OK, I gotta go.
And you know what else I've decided to do? I'm going to keep seeing the bald woman.
How much tip do you leave on $8.15?
That's my whole afternoon! I was going to look for sneakers.
Remember when you came to audition for us?
(still on the phone) All right fine.... Whatever
No. And he's not a pig-man is he?
She had to be impressed by that conversation, had to! It was a great performance. I am unbelievable on the phone. On the date they should just have two phones on the table at the restaurant, done.
Oh, *please*! Me? C'mon! That's *great*! Are you kidding? I think thats fan*tastic*! I've always encouraged experimentation! I'm the first guy in the pool! Who do you think you're talking to?
Well, it's the damnedest thing. The cat dies. So she comes back into town, she finds the cat lying on the carpet stiff as a board.
Ah, great, great. (sniffs) What's that smell? Smoke? (walks to the kitchen) Hey everybody, I think I smell some smoke back here...(smoke boils into the doorway.) FIRE! FIRE! Get out of the way!
Me? You see what he did here, you see how he tried to sneak into my space?
All right. At last, we're finally gettin' out of here.
Ah. You see, the man who was the butler, uh, had gotten into a car accident with Jerry, and because he didn't have any insurance, the judge decreed that the man become Jerry's butler.
It's like Im thinking of something, and you're (snaps fingers) one step ahead of me.
You shook my hand in that coffee shop.
All right, I'm gonna find a guy with a truck. GLC must live on!
What are you up to now, uh, Step Nine?
Why don't you give me the twenty, and I'll stop and get change, and then you and I can... uh... you-know, settle.
I guarantee you that Moses was a picker. You wander throughh the desert for forty years with that dry air. ... You telling me you're not going to have occasion to clean house a little bit.
I already bought it! I've been lyin' to you for three days, and now you're all screwin' me!
You know what? I could probably do this. Whats the difference.
(Turning back to Jerry, he takes the check back. He just now notices the shirt Jerry's wearing, and snickers, pointing) Nice shirt.. (Laughs, Jerry shrugs) What is this? Is this what you wore on the show?
That condom killed me. Why do they have to make the wrappers on those things so hard to open?
It's just that I was the one who actually paid for the big salad. She just happened to hand it to you. But it's no big deal.
Oh, no, not just me, the whole organization. Especially Mr. Morgan.
I was just wondering what it was you wanted for dessert.
Oh, yeah? Holistic.. that's what I need. That's the answer.
Well I've never met your sister but obviously these are not hard-and-fast rules. (to the waitress) Darling, the tea is getting a little cold sweetheart.
... She's got it stashed away in there somewhere.
But it--eh.. It was here, I'm tellin' you, an' w--w--it was really here! The, there was, a, bar, and a, an' a dance floor..
Well, it was a hell of a ride.
I know what you're going through. Women. Who knows what they want?
So, whaddya say? You know you'll always be the only man I'll ever love.
Are you looking deep down at the real person underneath?
Hey, listen don't oversleep. You can't afford to be late again.
I believe that I am about to become the target of a systematic process of intimidation and manipulation, the likes of which you have never -
We were in the lobby during the intermission of the play. I was buying her one of those containers of orange drink, for five dollars. I reached into my pocket to pay for it, I looked down; theres this piece of green floss hanging from my fingers.
Hey! Uh--listen--did you get your--uh--boss's Knick ticket, for Kramer?
(hitting Cynthia playfully with a napkin) Stop it, stop it.
People smoke, Elaine. My mother smoked. It didnt hurt me.
(Even more nervous than before) Oh, the, uh, the cabin.. well, (Clears throat)
I'm not gonna give you my card unless you tell me what it's for!
Because, if I'm looking straight ahead, and something enters my field of vision, that's merely a happenstance. (Elaine loudly snaps and unfolds her napkin at the next table to get Russell's attention.)
Is that what I ask for? The BIG salad?
I mean I'm the one who bought it.
Take it easy. Take it easy. It's not the end of the world.
Oh no no no no - we have to be in California next week. We're starting a TV show.
Oh! Modelling! What's that like? Fun? Ha ha. (to self in head) Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!
Hey, hey, hey! Whats goin on here? (To Jerry) You didnt agree to anything, did ya?
Hey, by the way, what'd you think of Miss Yoshimura?
Well, I still think you shoulda told me.
Well, I gotta go back there and try again. Hi Sheila.
Look at this sparkle. (looks up, sees Lindsay's mother) Mrs. Enright! (runs after her) Mrs. Enright! Mrs. Enright!
(Sarcastic) Maybe for her new performance piece she'll give birth on stage.
What's the difference? You know they way I work. I'm like a commercial jingle. First it's a little irritating, then you hear it a few times, youre hummin it in the shower, by the third date it's (sings) "By Mennen!".
I know that's why I bought `em but they're not comfortable.
You know what this means? I can't see her anymore either.
Where do you come up with this stuff?
The woman she's "lesbianing" with? Susan told me she's *never* been with a guy.
I see, well, thats open to interpretation. Because so much depends on the layering and the quality of the wetness in the eyes.
You know what you oughta do. You should go to her office and heckle her.
Anywhere in the city - I'll tell you the best public toilet.
Uh, yes, uh...you don't know me, my name is George Costanza...did you happen to rent Breakfast At Tiffany's?
Well, you know, book reports. That kind of stuff.
Get out of here. I didn't see any cameras there.
You've got 'shiksappeal'. Jewish men love the idea of meeting a woman that's not like their mother.
'Why don't I rent the movie.' See, this is when I like you. Alright, now I'm relieved. (Kramer enters and comes over to the booth.)
. We should be having dinner with our sons when we're sixty.
I dont know, what were doin here, this is ridiculous.
(Sliding over to make room for her) Sit down. Join us, please.
There he is. Right on time as usual.
No no, I never said I was a good driver, I said I was a good parker.
Because it's really a pretty good little story. Don't you think?
Flying him in? How longs he staying for?
But it's not a photograph, I need a photograph!
Jerry, can I talk to you for a second? (They enter Jerry's apartment)
I'm really serious. I think that's a good idea.
I'm all for awkward pauses. Fix me up with her.. Wait a minute, Nina just saw me in my Timberlands! Now I have to wear them every time I see her.
Hello, Ken. It's George Costanza. I think we need to talk.
I got a job interview. They want to see me this afternoon.
Well, you know, I gotta go to, uh, Susan's parent's house for dinner.. and, you know, I want to shower first.. and I want to leave myself plenty of time.
A garden! I cant believe theres a garden!
So, were talking, and I dont like to go too long before I ask them out, I wanna get it over with right away, so I just blurt out, What are you doing Saturday night?
Did you ever go to a singles weekend in the Poconos?
Uhm...Id like to ask you...ask you to analyze a hypothetical phone call, you know, from a female point of view.
Well does it say anywhere in the contract about my car being used as a whorehouse? 'Cause I don't remember reading that clause either..
Actually, (George flips the book back to the beginning) I'll take these nice glossy ones.
I know, I know...don't skimp. Go go go go...
Oh, no no no. I was just looking for stock-pages. Here it is. Looking for the quotes. Gotta check to quotes. Love a good quote. Oh, IBM up a quarter.
Well I was dropping of the calzone money for the week.... Um shouldn't you be at work by now?
I know but I couldn't think of anything else to say to her.
He just read it. (Russell vomits again. Jerry and George look ashamed.)
I think that's Mr. Hayman. ...The gym teacher from our High School.
Ah, well, that's very mature. What about you?
Missing his plane? Wasn't that a charter flight?
Would you stop that please. Would you just stop that?
(Standing up) I just got here, Ma! I'd like to spend a little time with you.
Oh, I was uh, I was waiting downstairs for the jackhammer, thought I'd drop by.
Well, what was I supposed to do? Get out of the shower, put on my bathrobe? Go all the way down to the other end? Come all the way back?
yeah that's right. I like it. He's such a cool guy
You think it's contact? It has to be touched?
Do you have something a little more... less expensive?
(to himself) That's what I'd like to know.
So, I've got ice cream all over my face. There were no napkins there. Whoever it was that's responsible for stocking that concession stand cost me a relationship.
(Getting up) You know what? Maybe I should take off.
Wow, he really does a number on you. (reads) "Seinfeld froze like a deer in the headlights in the face of incessant heckling."
Yeah! She made me promise not to tell you .It's supposed to be a joke.
You want my friend to ask his uncle, a man who just lost his wife of 44 years, for a death certificate so that he can save a few bucks on a flight?
Oh, this is all locking in now. It is all locking in! (laughing)
I tell you, I really don't think so-called relationship humor is what this show is all about.
(to Claire) Now, a woman calls me, all right?
(enthusiastic) Yeah. You get a couch. I get rid of my father. It couldn't be more perfect!
What did they do for toilet paper in the civil war?
If you're in some situation where some fast cash will save your life, I'll give you the code.
Aaaa (looking around for Jerry) aaaa (finds Jerry) Ah ha. They had plans huh? They were busy. They were busy with their (doing a little dance to make the plans seem all that important) big plans!
I like history. Civil War. Maybe I could be a professor, or something.
Yes, I like to just be able to take the blankets and swish them and swirl them, you know what I mean? You know, I don't like being all tucked in. I like to have a lot of room, you know I like to have my toes pointed up in the air. Just like to scrunch up the blankets.
If you dont say anything I will assume its a plane crash.
Shhh! Listen, you gotta do me a favor. Give me your wallet. I'll give it back to you later.
(Holding up Kramer's book) According to this, it took.. 10 hours. It eased into the water like an old man into a nice warm bath - no offence. (Pause) So, uh, Clarence, how about abandoning this apartment, and letting me shove off in this beauty?
He probably doesn't want to get chocolate on his fingers. That's the way these society types eat their candy bars.
Will I call you when I get home? ha ha What do you think? ee, you kill me kill me
(from bathroom) VANDELAY, SAY VANDEL... (George falls) ... Vandelay Industries, ...
What do you mean you didn't think I wasn't gonna use them?!
Y'know, I'm better with the mothers than I am with the daughters.
Eh, listen Mr. Kruger, I got a message from Dr. Van Nostrand and he says it might be wise to you to see another doctor about that mole.
Alright, but no later, because my parents are coming back.
This is nighmare. Kramer how long was I on?
That's insulting! Ted Danson makes eight hundred thousand dollars an episode.
Yeah, eighty-three. Used to belong to John Voight.
So we started drinking, and I'll tell you I don't know if it was the alcohol or the ammonia, but the next think I knew she was mopping the floor with me.
What are you, Crazy? I can't ask the guy for more cigars after you burned down his cabin!
I still have it. The collar's okay. I wear it under sweaters.
All right. (throws his coat back down on the seat and sits down opposite them)
Seemingly. Seemingly, to the untrained eye, I can fully understand how you got that impression. What looked like pushing...what looked like knocking down...was a safety precaution! In a fire, you stay close to the ground, am I right? And when I ran out that door, I was not leaving anyone behind! Oh, quite the contrary! I risked my life making sure that exit was clear. Any other questions?
Aah! the minute I saw this girl, we just clicked. She's got such a nice face. hummmm her eyes, her mouth, nose
Nah, the cable's out. What's with you? You look dead.
I wanna bite into a big hunk of cheese, just bite into it like it's an apple.
Ye - yeah. And we had a pact, you know.
You are not gonna believe whats going on with this woman.
We just came from Chadway's(?) What's going on.
We've just been through this! You don't remember? We just had this exact same conversation a minute ago!
Why do I get pesto? Why do I think I'll like it? I keep trying to like it, like I have to like it.
(harassed) Are you aware that I'm being charged for Tuesday's appointment? I had to take my mother to the chiropodist.
Shut your traps and stop kicking the seats! We're trying to watch the movie! And if I have to tell you again, we're gonna take it outside and I'm gonna show you what it's like! You understand me? Now, shut your mouths or I'll shut 'em for ya, and if you think I'm kidding, just try me. Try me. Because I would love it!
(out the window) Keith, Keith, up here. Can you do me a favor? I need you to go to the unemployment office with me. I, I'm Jerry's friend  the guy from the locker room,  I'm the chucker. It'll take five minutes. Wait. Wait.
Yes but then everything is all pulled down and it's jus.. Anyway. The damage, unfortunately, has marred an otherwise fine automobile, rendering it virtually undriveable.
(worried) Yeah, that's right. What if it's a genetic thing, like father like son?
[to himself] Hey, whatd'ya know? Look at that! A *lesbian* sighting. Oh-ho! My lucky day. They're *so* fascinating. Why is that? Because they don't want us. You gotta respect that...
Of course you do, but youre imagining a guy you like, not a guy who goes, Oh no, I dont drink coffee late at night. If I call her now, shes gonna think Im too needy. Women dont wanna see need. They want a take-charge guy  a colonel, a Kaiser, a tsar.
Okay. Uh, my mother is is going to pay for the sessions. ... Oh,Elaine?
Hu humm? i suppose we could go to Lincoln Center and I'd be wearing sneakers and jeans and that would be fine too.
(Depressed) Well,.. the Andrea Doria.. that was quite a fire. (Moves to the door, leaving)
Did you here that? I can't believe this he's eating his sandwich.
Allison! Hi! Oh, my God! How are you?
Yeah.( reaches for the purse and finds a piece of paper . he looks annoyed.
(to himself, resentful) What kind of a snobby, stuck-up, cult is this?!
Oh Jerry, that is so sweet of you but actually i already ate.
All Simons was able to find out is that hes in the hospital.
I like sports. I could do something in sports.
(worked up) I'm aware! I'm aware!! But this is Marisa Tomei, Elaine. An Oscar winner! How can I live the rest of my life, knowing I coulda been with Marisa Tomei? She said I was just her type! She loves short, stocky, balding funny men!
Hello! All right, we should be going. Come on...
Yeah, well, she's trying to track you down.
Ah! Health's not good enough. I want more than health. Health's not doing it for me anymore. I'm sick of health.
Alright, alright, I'll go on the date, but that's that.
So he... had his hands and, uh, he was uh
I have noticed she does tend to go to the bathroom right after we finish eating.
Well, Steven, I, uh.. (All the sudden, a small gang steps out of nowhere, surrounding George)
Well what's in this giant box out in the hall?
(Somewhat stern) Oh, the thing's cancelled. Sit down.
You got less than sixty seconds. That's like dismantling a time bomb. What got into you?
Kramer, Kramer's not here...I knew it. I knew it! I knew this would happen. (SCREAMING) Kramer! Kramer!
My cousin worked for Bouchard's. They used to use the bouilla-base for a toilet. (Jerry and Russell are shocked.)
Oh! That's good judgment. That's a pile of judgment there. Sure.
And I didnt even ask her out. She asked me out first. She called me up. What was I supposed to do? Say no? (laughs) I cant do that to someone.
No, no no it's not about postponing. I just think the first day of Spring is the perfect day to get married. You know, Spring! Rejuvenation! Rebirth! Everything is blooming all the
Dont insult me, my friend. Remember who youre talking to. No ones a bigger idiot than me.
Pulp can move, Baby! Why didn't you eat a real breakfast?
(looks back to the group) I can read lips. You said let's sleep together.
And I'm moving out of my parents' house, I'm taking that apartment on 86th street, remember the one we saw?
And isn't it more fun using the urinal?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's in the vault. I'm putting it in the vault.
Who's Bozo? Bozo the Clown, that's who Bozo is. When I was a kid, Bozo the Clown was the clown, bar none.
Well, it's not my fault. You poked me!
(Yelling from the bathroom) Don't tell her anything, she'll kill me!!
If you don't mind, sir. I'll be here at 8.
Oh my god he's not kidding. (exhale gasp)
Donna. Oh, youre the one that likes that commercial!
Uh, anyway, (Waving bye to everyone) onward and upward.
Wow, Keith Hernandez. He's such a great player.
I can't believe it. He's going! He's fired!
(jokingly) You are still paying for this lunch?
Yeah, people who work at NORAD, whore on twenty-four hour missile watch. Everything was going along so great. She was laughing, I was funny... I kept saying to myself, Keep it up, dont blow it, youre doing great.
Alright look, I'm gonna tell you, but I made a pact with Cynthia, we swore we were not going to tell you and Elaine.
Thanks a lot. Ill give it back to you in a week.
The nickname. George. What is that? It's nothing. It's got no snap, no zip. I need a nickname that makes people light up.
Anyway, I don't even get a thank you. I don't get it!
(Letting his conscious get the best of him) I wonder how Susan's father's going to react to this. Alright, what- what's the worst he could do? So you burn a cabin down..
Frolf, frisbee golf Jerry. Golf with a frisbee. This is gonna be my time. Time to taste the fruits and let the juices drip down my chin. I proclaim this The Summer of George!
Besides, what's it gonna cost me? Thirty-eight bucks?
All right. So let me ask you a question. Who was the man in the cape?
I hate this mall, there are never any spaces here...
Right. The other members of our party. (closes partition) Other members of our party? What other members of our party? I didn't even know we were in a party. Oh, I'm telling you, the jig is up.
Fragile Frankie Merman? I never liked that guy.
Well I, uh, I'm not sure how you pronounce it or anything, but I, uh, I believe it's Mnage  Trois?
Well if Houdini couldn't do it, what chance do I have?
You gotta give us odds. At least two to one - you gotta put up two-hundred dollars.
Elaine, shes a psychic. She knows how the kids going to be.
I told you, I told you! Ha ha ha! Ooh ooh!
(Staring at the doll) This doll (Pointing) looks like my mother.
I don't know where you're getting this from. I....you're serious aren't you? Oh, (laughing) you see? You see, you just don't know my sense of humor. Dan, don't I joke around all the time?
He said that? (Daphne shacks her head) What a nerve. How dare he say something like that.
I have never seen a Mohel like that.
(whispering) Glenda, can I ask you a favor? Can I have this seat?
I dont understand, you never talk to her about other women?
All right Bubble Boy. Let's just play... Who invaded Spain in the 8th century?
If I do it, will you buy a computer?
Oh, yeah I'm sure he loves to hear from fans in the locker room.
What are you doing? You're making more than I am. A secretary cannot make more than her boss.
...but is there any way that I could possibly have Neil's phone number?
Out? Oh no, I've been to four other places, you're the only ones that have had it.
(to Jerry, yelling) You told her? She's not your wife!
Well, I didn't really tell Susan about it, and she doesn't really have anything else to do.
Why don't you call her agency. Maybe she's been out of town and she didn't get the calls.
I said faddah, I meant Father. Just a little bit nervous.
(incredulous) I look just like him. I. Me. (flings his arms out) This! This is what her boyfriend looks like. How is that possible?
(animated) Fixed up? A cup of coffee! A cup of coffee is not a fix up!
King Edward. (snapping his fingers) King Edward, Jerry.
How do I know, maybe, you know, maybe she wanted to be polite.
Well, I can see that. What do you have to do that for? Who cares about your pants size?
A man gave me... a massage. hu, hu
(defensive) So what? So what if I do?
Well if she can't tell "six" from "sex" then how is she going to lip read from across the room?
What! There's no signs here! This is an outrage!
He's older, completely covered in filth, no whistle, but I think it's him.
Have you ever seen a Schnitzer's rye? It - it's huge!
So, tell him you're concerned about it and he should see someone else.
Snoopy and Prickly Pete. Should I keep driving?
Yeah. (clears his throat) We should do this again.
This was supposed to be 'The summer of George'! The summer of George.
Yeah, well when you don't actually do the steps, you can go through them pretty quick. You can get through six a day.
Hey, maybe I could bribe one of those women that hand out the towels in the powder room.
Alrighty, so. That's one tuck and one no-tuck. Got that?
I'll fight ya! Not the face! Not the face! (The struggle continues.)
I'm gonna go with you. I gotta get a new suit. I got a second interview with MacKenzie, and I think I'm really close. They're all taking me out to lunch on Friday.
(standing) All right, I'm gonna move my car, my meter's up. Can't park in this city.
Elaine, get something! Its all taken care of.
Elaine, of course I'm concerned. I'm payin' for those meals. It's like throwing money down the toilet.
She treated me to the Arabian mocha java.
I don't even like to use urinals, always been a stall man.
Because, I've got the coat. I can sit in the car and not get cold.
You got your own shampoo, conditioner, body lotion! Jerry, body
Ohh, hey there, young fella. (They shake hands) What's your major?
Yeah, ha ha, It's not the toilets, it's not the toilets. It's something else. Are you ready for this?
Kramer, what the hell are you talking about?
Well, I think Poppie's got some problems. There's a whole other thing going on with Poppie. So how did you leave it?
How could you not know who Bozo the Clown is?
Well, maybe they're done with it. I could go pick it up.
Puddys just gonna give you the car, huh? (Skeptically) Youll see. First they stick you with the undercoating, rust-proofing, dealer prep. Suddenly, youre on your back like a turtle.
That's what I'm afraid of. You know Mr. Steinbrenner, . . .
No, no I do. You know it's just...
(realizing he was short changed) I was in the pool! I was in the pool!
How do you know? What if pig-man had a two-seater?
Wow! I didn't try that 'til I was 23.
So all right I'll speak to you through Jerry and everything.
No, its not a problem, I can get rid of the apartment this afternoon.
What're you doing? What're you, telling secrets? What're you laughing at?
Don't you see. She's looking at my pictures.
Exactly, you know what I'm talking about, right?
And she didn't say something to you about a certain something?
This friend of Susan's is staying with us for two weeks...Now am I wrong or is that excessive?
No, it's doing the same thing to someone that they did to you.
(as the others are repositioning the tables) No, no, you can't do that, they're round, it makes an 'eight' and, yeah, well alright.
You know what I do at the Yankees, when one of these old guys is breathing down my neck?
No, Julie, Julie, don't insult me. You know, what difference does it make who pays for lunch. It's totally meaningless.
Im outta there. I did it! Its over.
I got a big problem here, Jerry. The tapes are worthless.
Maybe he was going to say "Of course I have to check with my associates."
(laughing it off and trying too hard) Yeah, yeah. I have a thing for Marisa Tomei. Like she would ever go out with a short, stocky, bald man. (forced laughter) Hu hu, ha ha. Like that's her type. Huh. She's an Oscar winner. (nervous laughter) He heh. Besides, I don't even know her. It's not like anyone's trying to fix us up. Who, who would try and fix me up with Marisa Tomei?
(still by the door) What? M-Maura, what are you doin' here? I ended this relationship... twice!
(pauses for a few seconds) OK, I'm tellin' you right now - if your kiddin' around I'm not gonna be able to be your friend anymore. I'm serious about that. You got that.
Hmm. What about a hole? You ever put anybody in "the box"?
He still wins but it's not a blowout.
(takes a bite) Oh, that's good. That's very good.
(Getting up, he addresses Jerry) All right, remember no rust-proofing. Commit to nothing. If you have to speak - mumble.
You know what? I changed my mind. I, uh, I don't think so.
Well, why would the guy make up something like that? Of all the names he could pick, why settle on Jon Voight?
What are you looking at me like that for?
Look, I am under direct orders from Mr Wilhelm. So if you have a problem with that, maybe you should just take it up with him.
Thats my candy line-up! Where are all my cards?! Theyre - theyre all on the floor!
You know my driver's waiting, I really should get running. Good to see you guys again.
Kramer, hey, hey! (Gets up out of his seat)
Well I don't think she is a multiple sneezer, because she sneezed again later, and it was also a single.
No, No! She's going out with a friend of mine. It's only courteous that we should try and like each other.
(To himself) So you're havin' the sex, next day you don't have to call. That's pretty good. (Back to Jerry) Go ahead.
(hanging up) All right, Jerry. I'll do it. See ya.
First class doesn't make it anymore. Now you get on the phone with Kimbrough, tell him what happened and tell him to get another plane down here, but this time, the good one - the Ted Danson plane.
Yes, she wants me to like her, if she likes me. But she doesnt like me!
Should I give you my keys, is that the transaction, trading keys...? Because Elaine has my keys.
Sure. So, uh, Jerry, there's an empty apartment in my building. If you and Hallie want, we could try and hold it, may...
I'm bored. She's boring, I'm boring, we're both boring. We got out to eat, we both read newspapers.
No, no. That's just the thing. Anna told me that Elaine said I was one of the worst seeds she'd ever seen.
No, I, uh, um, wa, wa, What did I do? ... Where are you going?
(seeing his parents being intimate) Oh, my god!
He's an obscure writer. Betnik, on the village.
Yeah, I may move out there. (getting 'yeah, right' glances from the Rosses) I mean it, I'll do it! OK, I'll see ya later. Keep it real!
Well, let's just say it wouldn't exist without me. (Notices another person in the library dressed the same as Celia.) So you two uh, shop at the same store, (hu)?
And now for the trifecta. (Picks up a hand held TV and gets back under the covers.)
Woo! Courtside! (mock-snide) Is that the best you could do? Ha ha!
Well, I'm sorry, Timmy...but I don't dip that way. (takes a chip.)
He-he was uh touching and rubbing. (nervous laugh)
I'd like to sleep with a LOT of other women.
(to himself) You can't tell much from those pictures.
Have you seen the new addition to the Guggenheim?
So are you going to Todd's party this weekend?
Thanks. Gee, you know, I thought you were mad at me.
The doc called and said the lab's backed up and now I'm not gonna get the results for another two days.
Yeah, I told her to call me here and to tell anyone who answers the phone to ask for a balding, stocky man with glasses. I better tell him I'm expecting a call.
Wow. Uh, what do I have to do?
It's just paper on a roll, that's it. And that's all it will ever be.
Right! And these pigeons broke the deal. I will not accept the blame for this!
(sad) Yeah! Yeah. Hey--hey you, you know.. Maybe I'll call you sometime.
Well, not recently. I craved. I crave all the time, constant craving...but I haven't yearned.
I...I...write a letter and then I..I go to China. I disappear in a sea of people for like six months, a year you know just while things simmer down. Ehm.. Ehm...Dear Susan. I'm sorry. I made a terrible mistake. I'm really , really sorry.
Play Now thinks I got problems in both legs. My own personal Rascal, Jerry. On the house.
We could be zipping all over the place.
Aren't those the guys that always go crazy and come back with a gun and shoot everybody?
Oh, uh, the cigars.. (Chuckles nervously) I'm, uh, suckin' 'em down. I'm puffing my brains out, yeah.
I was throwing up all night. It was like my own personal Crying Game.
(Talking about his would-be apartment) You could fit 15 people in that bathroom..
Oh, no, that's just the old, uh, the old handicap acting up.
Was that wrong? Should I have not done that? I tell you I gotta plead ignorance on this thing because if anyone had said anything to me at all when I first started here that that sort of thing was frouned upon, you know, cause I've worked in a lot of offices and I tell you peope do that all the time.
Unbelievable, I'm never gonna get out of here. The guy goes to pee, he never comes back. It's like a science fiction story.
Why does she want you to be mad?
Well, it's just, all you said was 'your welcome', which is nice. It's very nice. But... I feel I gotta get the apology.
So Anyway, I started to compliment Elaine on her sketches and it turns out,they're Paula's.
I mean he's a good fighter and a nice guy but I don't like him.
Oh yeah, real cool. You're a cool guy.
What if the pilot gets picked up and it becomes a series?
(Yelling out to a waitress) Gonna need some water here!
Eh...come oooon...(starts stabbing the paper with the pen. Mr. Wilhelm comes in)
Elaine said your pretty good at this stuff.
Why? Why? 'Cause he's off his rocker! That's why.
I...was trying to lead the way. We needed a leader! Someone to lead the way to safety.
Kramer was on Murphy Brown? That son of a gun!
You got hookers turning tricks in my car. How's that for starters.
She called. He yelled Cartwright. I missed her.
They wanna have another meeting? They wanna buy it?! They wanna but it?! Oh! I tell you! We're gonna be rich!! What are we gonna get for this? Fifty, sixty thousand?
I can't come out. They're standing right by the door. Throw it up!
You know, we could go uptown, and that way we could give Jerry a ride home.
Well, I've to every Brentano's. This thing's flagged in every database in town!
I'm starving. We should have had lunch first..
So, you wanna go home and...make up, officially?
O.K., Danny, take a swing. (Tartabull swings the bat.) N-No! No! No! You're opening up your shoulder.
Yeah, you gotta do it classy (wipes his mouth to his sweater.)
Oh!, so what. I'd rather she hate me and thought I was good looking....At least I can get somebody else. (scratching his chest) What is this? Why am I itching?
(Still focused on the nudist) They're naked, the gardeners naked.. the bellhops. (Jerry makes a noise of astonishment) One big nude-a-rama.
Can I come upstairs, please? (Elaine pushes the button and lets George in.)
(spins his chair back to face her) So you got a $25,000 a year raise.
"Hey listen, let me give you my card. It's got my home number on it. I want to buy the first pair when the next shipment comes in."
Well I am. Couldn't you try to go through some of that stuff I put in your shoebox?
Y'know the average life span for an American male is like, 72. You're really... kinda pushin' the envelope there.
It's funny! (To Elaine) and it wouldn't kill you to not be so funny either.
Wait a minute? He's picking up the van tonight? This is perfect. I'll drive Rhisa to someplace romantic. Then when my father slides the door open, I'm in the van kissing his brother's daughter.
You're right, how did I miss that? (Begins unlocking the door, mutters under his breath) Maybe because it's a crock of shit.
Yes. Me, too. I wanna be normal. Normal.
Uh, it was dangling! There were only two left in the machine! He mustve bought one, and gotten both.
So we had a good time... the four of us.
What, you didn't ask him about the car?
ho ho ho ho. You know I only got two weeks left of unemployment. I got to prove I've been looking for a job to get an extension
Excuse me, darling, do I detect a Portuguese accent?
Well, I'm not buying it. No way. Forget it. No way I'm buying this! (beat) I mean, look at it! What is it? It's a bunch of squiggly lines! (beat) Are you telling me you couldn't paint this?
It's not that easy. It's like "Beat The Clock," there's a lot of pressure there.
Yeah, anyway, she's uh, having some kind of a family lunch, I'll swing by after.
I feel terrible, I can't be responsible for breaking up a marriage. Oh no (starting moving for the door, Elaine begins to stop him)
We have no need to speak. We communicate with deep soulful looks.
All right, so are you ready, so we'll go out and get something to eat.
(outside, looking the guy trying the suit through the window, and thinking out loud) What's this? Can't I leave this place for a second? (goes in, take off his jacket, walks to the guy and talks to him with an european accent) Can I help you?
Oh, the nose job. I don't know, what did you think?
What did you do here? You took out the wrong guy.
Look at this. There's no spaces here. (to another car) Excuse me, are you gettin' out?
Nobody drives like me. Nobody. I'm doing things in this car, you have no idea they're going on. Wanna see me make a right turn from the left lane? Watch this.
Aw, I've just got to say it once, everybody else gets to say it, why can't I say it?
No, occasionally I'll forget to let the machine pick up. Anyway, they made this large donation, to a women's prison, and I get to go down there and check it out.
Wait a second. (George gets up and heads for the statue in Kramers hands.) I cant believe this! Let me see this.
Okay, what about a nice frame? With a picture of another guy in it. Frame says I care for you, but if you wanna get serious, perhaps you'd be interested in someone like this.
I wonder what toilet paper was loike in the 1860's. Did they carry it in rolls in their duffle bags?
(urgent whisper) Elaine! You have got to get me Marisa Tomei's phone number!
(disbelief) What?! They're stealing the name?! That's my name, I made it up!
You know what? I should really go talk to her. Nothing confrontational. Just two adults sitting down trying to clear the air. You know, I just know if I could spend some time alone with her. I've got to. (he grabs his jacket) I've got to.
Oh, nothin' much. I went over to jerry's, uh, talked to Jerry.
I just want the both of you to know how much you mean to me, and I love you both very, very much.
Oh yeah, when are you gonna execute that plan?
I still don't understand this. Abby has a mentor?
But I digress. Let me see, now. You were standing at one end of the line and I was right next to you. And I remember we were even for like, the first five yards and then , BOOM,...You were gone.
'When you're alone, and life is making you lonely, you can always go...'
Susan Davis? (Getting possessive) Hey, wait a second..
Ya know, I was just a little surprised.
Alright, what are we getting? It's hot in here!
I got scared there for a second. The Knicks without Ewing.
Yep. Classic horseshoe pattern. I've seen a lot of this.
(very casual and raising his hand in the air) Yep. That's five!
What kind of plastic do you think it is? What do you think like that dry cleaning plastic?
I can't be blind, Jerry The blind are courageous.
Well, after dinner last week, she invites me back to her apartment.
What if I want to walk around a little?
Because. There was a lot of cake lying around the house. Just sitting there going with all the excess milk from all the experiments [grins]
(To Carl) Oh, by the way, order anything you want, it's all on me. Just do me a tiny favor pretend we're old friends. Oh my God! Mr. Morgan! What a coincidence, it's Mr. Morgan. Mr. Morgan, I want you to meet a dear old friend of mine, Carl.
I left three messages. I can't believe this woman. She has sex with me, leaves ten minutes later then I never hear from her again. What kind of a person does this? I mean, she used me. I feel cheap and violated.
Well, some of 'em look good. The ones that look good you don't even know about.
But in the zoo, you know, they might, put a woman in there with me to uh.. you know, get me to mate.
(pointedly to Elaine) Oh. Thanks very much for yesterday, by the way.
No-no-no, Kramer. Kramer! Kramer! You *cannot* abandon people in the middle of an airport pickup! It's a binding social contract. We... we must go forward... not back.
Theres just no justice. This experience has changed me. Its made me more cynical, more bitter, more jaded.
Well, I was exaggerating a bit, just for effect.
What's he yelling about? They're stealing jackets here!
Well you know in college they used to call me the little bulldog.
I dont know, 120, 130Then they sent some guys to sandblast for 6 hours. Tomorrow they are putting in asbestos.
No. Semi-daily. Four or five times a week.
Hey by the way my parents really want to have your parents over dinner before they leave town.
(bursting out of the bathroom, fumbling with his fly) Button fly! Why do they put buttons on a fly? It takes ten minutes to get these things open!
(CONT'D) Excuse me...I really... What's happened is that my friend forgot where he parked and if you're not in a big hurry, we'd really appreciate it if...
The truth. you want the truth? It is your earrings It is the chopsticks but it's so much more. You're pretentious. You call everyone by their full name You call my doorman, Sammy, "Samuel" but you didn't even say "Samuel" You went "Sam - U- EL" Papie-eh Mach-eh What is Papie-ay Mach-ay?
I was handcuffed to the bed.. In my underwear, (Sighs) where I remained.. (Scene cuts to another story) She was attractive.. She was, also, infact, a Nazi.. (Cuts to another story) The water.. that I had been swiming in was.. very cold. And, when I dropped the towel, there was.. significant shrinkage.. (Scene cuts to, yet, another story) Her parents were looking at me.. So, there I was, with a marble rye hanging from the end of a fishing pole.. (Scene cuts to his closing statements) In closing, these stories have not been embellished, because - they need no embellishment. They are simply, horrifyingly, the story of my life as a short, stocky, slow witted bald man. (Gets up) Thank you. (Every memeber of the board shows some sign that George's story is most deserving of the apartment. Ricardi is crying. George turns to leave, then remembers one more thing..) Oh, also.. my fiance died from licking toxic envelopes that I picked out. (Sobs and loud crying erupts from the board members) Thanks again. (Leaves. Eldridge looks defeated)
This is my ketchup. I bought this ketchup just so I could have as much as I want.
So you're telling me instead of them being happy to see me, they're going to be upset because I didn't bring anything. Ttst --You see what I'm saying?
The doctors thought he had cancer, but the surgery revealed he never actually had it.
How many people does he do that for?
Like a "Hey your mother is uglier than Hazel. Hazel really puts your mother to shame"
You can see the Cayman Islands in there? Is something going to happen to me? What?
I can't believe I missed Kramer. You know he asked me to go with him to California.
I didn't even know Fulton was in the hospital.
Well, anyway, the book club meets tomorrow, Mr. Temple.
Please give it to me. I love to help people. This is what I do. Come on. I'm going this way. (he takes the table from Jodi's hands and she has no choice but to follow him)
Okay. Now, why do I have to see (points) you?
Alright, alright, I'll call Heather, you'll get your hat back, I will get a second date. Ha ha ha. Now watch the magic.
(he thinks) I think the hats. The hat conveys that solemn religious look you want in a faith. Very pious.
It's like puberty that never stops. Ear puberty, nose puberty, knuckle puberty, you gotta be vigilent. Let me ask you this Do you know where Walker Street is downtown? I've got a league meeting there.
When is it going to be my turn, Jerry? When do I get my 15 minutes? I want my 15 minutes!
I gotta prep. I need a couple of anecdotes, a few you-were-right-abouts. It's a whole procedure. Wasn't Fragile Frankie the one that used to run into the woods every time he got upset?
(reluctant) Oh that uh, that seems like a lotta trouble.
So we order lunch, and were talking. Finally, she blurts out how its not working.
All right, if she puts the bags down before she greets you, thats a good sign.
One little wink. She'll freak out, tell my parents. They'll be all over me. Who is this guy?
Well, I am just a T-bone kinda guy. Love that T-bone. In fact, you might as well call me--
So you think you can put the suit aside and hold it for me?
Oh no, Morgan is a good man sir.
No no no no, you have to approach this as if he was a woman.
I got rejected by a bald woman. A bald woman rejected me. Heh, you like that one? A woman with no prospects and no *hair*, told me that I wasn't her type. Apparently *baldy* likes a slimmer guy.
I'd like to be able to get it out.
Thinking? Nothing. What could I possibly be thinking?
Yes, good to see you, too. And Good luck with, uh... with the whole thing, there.
I can't believe you're hoarding sex moves. I'm out there rubbing two sticks together. You walk around with a zippo.
Hey, maybe this cheating thing is what I could use to ditch Maura.
Hey, I'm his nephew, all right? Don't worry about it. Go ahead. Check it out.
What am I scared of? I'm scared of the same thing that you are, everything! Why don't you just use your own name?
What are you worried about, you know it.
Umm, Im not. Its just a sociological experiment!
Well, we're collectors. We, uh, see objects of great beauty and, uh, we must have them.
I think things were going ok. We were having a nice conversation.
So I'm dressing and she's staring up at me, struggling to compute this unprecedented turn of events. I don't know what to say to reassure this woman, and worst of all, I don't have the time to say it. The only excuse she might possibly have accepted is if I told her I am in reality Batman, and I'm very sorry, I just saw the Bat-Signal. It took me 3 days of phone calls to get her to agree to see me again. Now she's waiting for me to call her, and she's
Did I tell you?! Did I tell you?!
No! My ticket?! You gave my ticket to Horneck?
(using the phone) Watch how it's done. Oh, hello, Mr. Vandelay? Would you like to buy a computer? Oh, really? Two dozen?
Say it's Saturday night in Spain. They go out dancing. You think they do the flamenco?
And I have to go. If I don't go, he'll know I'm lying.
If I see things as they are, I would ask 'why' or 'why not?'
(singing) Master of the House/Quick to catch your eye/Never wants a passerby to pass him by...
C'mon, c'mon...(stands up and physically rolls Betsy to the left side of the couch.) See, now, is that so bad?
Oh I'm seeing someone, yes. You know her, Daphne Bower.
I, I couldnt wait. I was too anxious to see you.
No you wouldn't. Nobody would. It's just that... they were missing, and... well I'm just inquiring. (chuckles nervously)
...So, anyway, if you think about it, manure is not really that bad a word. I mean, it's 'newer', which is good, and a 'ma' in front of it, which is also good. Ma-newer , right?
(To a passing waitress) I'll have some coffee and a doughnut.
Oh, I think it is! I think that's exactly what it is!
Really? (Realizes) Well, you don't think it had anything to do with what I said, do you?
(scoffs) Those unions. (sighs) Okay. Sports,...movies. What about a talk show host?
I told I had a bus transfer that was only good just for another hour.
You're in the movie? Is he in the scene?
Because the underwear is pulled up from the back and ... it wedges in..
I can't. I gotta make the weekly call to the folks.
I'll tell you what, why don't you read this book and let's just see if you can explain it to me.
(surprise) Huh. I never heard you say you admire me for anything.
Well, we would like to be in business. Let's do business. We'll have some business. Let's have business.
(light) No. No, no, no. The cushion was turned over.
Oh, it's gotta be fifty! Hee hee! You know how much Ted Danson makes, huh?
I'm the opposite of every guy you've ever met.
(animated) It failed here! Because, here, every time you turn on a TV, all you see is four morons sitting round an apartment, whining about their dates!
Of course, not as exciting as miss crop circles, but...
What, you're gonna pass up a wonderful opportunity to put that aloe pusher in her place?
(to Donna) Why did you have to get me in trouble?
But you are Blanche... You *are* in the shackles. Oh, I can't wait to read my *Time* magazine! Laaaast copy, too. Maybe I'll read it tomorrow-- in the park! It's supposed to be a beeyootiful day! Have a nice life... sentence, that is!
No, you just tell him ah, an old boyfriend has come back into your life.
I bet they have more money than mine.
(Let down) Yeah, but you - you promised it to me.
Nah, I gotta deliver some Christmas presents to my parents.
Well, I told it to Susan before, and she didn't like it.
(on phone  calling secretary) Hello Margery, George Costanza. How are you sweet heart? Listen, can you give Mr. Thomassoulo a message for me? Yes. If he needs me, tell him (screams) IM IN MY OFFICE! Thanks.
I mean, we're not stupid, right? We know when something's funny!
Maybe she moved it up in the rotation.
Coulda fixed me up with Marisa Tomei. She said I was just her type!
yeah, Kramer, we're, uh, kind of in the middle of something here. We're trying to do a little work..
Well why don't you get a hold of it and change what you don't like.
(standing up) I'm just gonna go to the bathroom.
(???), we'll see you in a little while.
Oh, it was. But he claimed it was a 5th Avenue bar.
Me too, really. Unless you'd really like to get one.
Yeah, yeah. You gotta come over tonight. We can play.
Yeah, yeah. She's seeing this guy, Art Vandelay.
(To Jane) You know, when I was a kid, I once found a dollar and fifty cents in change on the bottom of the pool.
It was on CNN ( Kramer comes in and he is taping from a Camcorder) This Chinese doctor Zeng Zau. has discovered a cure for baldness.
This is a brand new jacket. Boy this really burns me up, ...
Mr. Morgan! Did you hear that? Mr. Morgan!
(Hands still out, even though they've stopped looking at them) What happened to him?
Sperry Rand Building. 14th floor, Morgan Apparel. Mention my name - she'll give you the key.
Elaine, I got to have another picture of Gillian.
I should be in a place like this. I envy this woman. Ya' get to wear slippers all day. Friends visit. They pity you. Pity is very underrated. I like it it's good. Plus they give you those word association tests. I love those.
Oh, this guy tried to sneak into my space.
(crestfallen) But you said it was my call.
Oh you can stuff your sorries in a sack, Mister!
(Quickly making it up) Well, possibly. I wrote an off-Broadway show, "La Cocina." ..Actually, it was off-off-Broadway. It was a comedy about a Mexican chef.
I gotta stay one step ahead of Neil.
I have to rewind it first. (George presses the rewind button on the tape recorder. He and Jerry stand there, waiting impatiently as it rewinds.) Alright, alright.
Yes of course go ahead. My guess is you're going to like this very much.
The next thing you know, he'll have you driving him to the airport..
This is all too much. So what are you feeling? What's going on? Are you like a couple again now?
Im sorry, I dont see the big deal about being a matador. The bull charges, you move the cape, whats so hard?
What, you are comparing me to Biff Loman, very encouraging. The biggest loser in history of American literature.
I just wanted to tell you that I really enjoyed Fair Game. I thought it was just brilliant.
Well, maybe so...but it was good enough for Mr. Jon Voight.
You know, you have to know how to do that. You cant have people shoving their arms into a six-hundred degree oven!
Um, excuse me, have you see a guy with like a horse face, big teeth, and a, and a pointed nose?
Ha Haaaaaaa... Jerry how do you like that.You see I get myself in a dizzy, I'm all worked up and for what?
If there's any doubt, I do a leave-behind. Keys, gloves, scarf -- I go back to her place to pick it up...(pop sound) date number two.
Of course you do... It's just, uh, y'know, I-I never *knew*, uh, that, uh...
I have no power Do you understand? I need hand. I have no hand.
Celia broke out of prison. I'm sitting in my home, she shows up at the door!
I know, I know. Listen, your stuff has to be done by now, why dont you just see if its dry?
I eh, I had a sandwich in my pocket.
Alright, so that's one tuck and one no-tuck.
I been, uh, thinking about the family. Tell me, uh, about Aunt Baby.
Anyway, again, I'm sorry about throwing you out of the car.
(After looking in the bag) The pea pods? All you saved was the pea pods? (Kramer enters)
The government is very touchy about us being in the air. Let us run around on the ground as much as we want. Anything in the air is a big production.
(Losing it) does not imply transfer of ownership. Moe, Sol, or Lem is not gonna get away with this!
The plane's been re-routed *back* to Kennedy. We've got 45 minutes.
"Aahhrgh...it wouldn't take...... long pause, audience laughter) ten minutes from now, I'll be sweating all over again ,I can feel it. I'm a human heat pump!"
I dont think theres ever been an appointment in my life where I wanted the other guy to show up. (George notices an elderly man in a leather chair.) Wait a second, is that him?
He's the guy we're the buying the chair for, remember? It was your suggestion.
Yeah, there was a fire in my apartment.
Elaine, Elaine, Elaine, Elaine...(distant alarm sound which is getting louder.)
What are you? Satan? I'm close to a job here. It's my second interview with them.
Uh, Carol, can I talk to you for a second? Right now?
I don't. Susan wants to have it out when Sally comes tomorrow.
Oh you mean face down on her chest.
Assistant to the General Manager!! Do you know what means?!? He'd could be askin' my advice on trades! Trades, Jerry, I'm a heartbeat away!
What did I get the veggie burger for? You got a veggie burger, so I had to get the veggie burger, I'm allover crums...
Yeah, I never know what's going on there.
No, I fake limp on my right. This is a real limp because I sprained my ankle.
(frantic) Jerry! Jerry, muh--muh--my hair-dryer ruined the picture! An' I need another one or I can't get back into the forbidden city!
Come on, lets not stand here too long, we might run in to her.
You took me to one of your shows..
It's not that I want to keep talking about it? just think that the subject should resolve itself based on its own momentum.
Alright, this is what ya gotta do I need ya to go out to the parking lot at Yankee Stadium, take the flyers off my car.
Oh I hate to hear this. That kind of growth really irritates me.
Quick. Get this thing back in the pizzeria
Ah, and I got a date with the sales woman. She's got a little Marisa Tomei thing going on.
Oh, well, I'm sure you can reach her...she's a poet. What does a poet need an unlisted number for?
Just the last few innings of a double-header.
Excuse me, the guy is wearing a jacket that my friend is...
I don't know. (George sits down at the table. Kramer enters.)
horning on my rock climbing trip. It's just supposed to be me and Tony
Why? Did she say something to you about why she broke up with me?
How's her handshake? A little firm, isn't it? Maybe a little too firm?
Ha, Yeah right, hang on, Ill ah, Ill get her for you. he, he, he, he. Seriously, what's up?
No, I did not! (They exit the coffee shop.)
(rage) Oh, it's got cachet, baby! It's got cachet up the yin-yang!
I thought I saw him look in the mirror suspiciously.
You think this is the plane that Ted Danson gets?
You, uh, you like baseball? [picks up baseball from desk]
Wait a minute. (astonished) You're thinking of moving to Florida again?!
She, uh, went shopping for some shoes for the wedding and, yada yada yada, I'll see her in six to eight months. (Kramer and Julie enter)
If she doesnt show up, we cant possibly have dinner with him alone.
Oh, please ... ... four dollars is f...
No, no no. That skips a generation. The baldness gene comes from your grandfather.
(annoyed) Not a peep. They just cleaned the carpets and left. Call themselves a cult!
I don't know, she lives right around the corner. You could take it here or go to the coffee shop.
Well what would I say in the note?
It never ends, this present stuff! Engagement present! Then they get married, you gonna have to get them something for that! Then the baby, there's another present. Then the baby starts getting their presents. I don't even like Drake.
In this scene my co-star who's right over here ( goes over to George who is still on the phone) Follow meeeee... is George Costanza, he plays an airline pilot who's just returned from Rome and I'm about to show him how much I've missed him.
She supports her whole family. (walking slowly into the room)
(Frantically) Did anybody call here asking for Vandelay industries?
I just popped in now. I'm a big pop-in guy.
Hey, people, people, people, people, people. Not bad, huh? Excuse me.
..And I went down there one time to see...
I tought I picked up a little something. I'm very good at this. Did you pick up anything?
This woman just set me up for a job!
(Mr.Wilhelm comes in and hears George yelling) You tell that son of a bitch no Yankee is ever comin' to Houston! Not as long as you bastards are running things!
What the hell is this? George, Elaine and I went to see Chunnel ... with Jerry. With Jerry, huh? With Jerry! Great. Great! (dials phone) Probably went to the 84th St. That's where I always go with Jerry.
People always leave old things in their medicine cabinet.
No, she's taking this course in education for her masters. It's part of her research project, so I have to be a guinea pig.
Thank you very much. (Peggy leaves the menus and walks away) So guess what I got do tomorrow?
Yeah, and you were engaged for like a minute, I was engaged for a year.
Alright the administrator's on the third floor. I'll meet you guys back at the car.
Yeah, the neck hole thing, and I would appreciate it if you would say you're sorry.
All right, let's--let's focus. Can we get back to the plan?
There's an easy move go from screwin' you behind your back to screwin' you right to your face.
Not a bad way to make a buck.
So, anyway, what's uh, what's the status with, uh...
Yeah, yeah, and we started talking, and she's this lawyer who's incredible! Everything I said was funny! You know, she laughed at everything I said, she thinks I'm hilarious. You know in a way, it was almost too good. I started so good, I can't go any place but down now, ya know? I got no place to go.
Hi, how are you guys? Listen, does either one of you have like a mint or piece of gum or...
Well, we just blew 240 bucks on a wheelchair.
Of course he is. There's got to be houses for rent in Tuscany. Do you know how big Tuscany is?
I calculated my odds of ever getting together with a Portuguese waitress. Mathematically, I had to do it, Jerry.
Channel eleven? Forgive me for trying to class up this place, for trying to have the Yankees reach another strata of society that might not watch channel eleven.
Have you ever given your code to anyone?
(Sarcastic) Yeah, performance artist. She's a real performer. A real trooper.
It was very traumatic. The last thing I remember is you flinching. Then, everything went black.
There she is. (waiving his arms quickly above the table - to nix the conversation) No no no no no no.
I solve problems. That's just what I do.
Alright, now the play is tomorrow night. So do you want to have dinner first, or do you just want to meet at the theatre?
Yeah, tell im. But quickly, Im double parked here.
No not vast (he pronounces it as "vost")
Why does everything have to be 'us'? Is there no 'me' left? Why can't there be some things just for me? Is that so selfish?
Since when is Elaine's boyfriend selling cars? I thought he was a mechanic.
(leaving to the bedroom) I gave it to Cosmo.
Do you uh feel the way you feel after the Risotto?
Canceled? Do I still get credit for the pick up? I was here!
I told ya. Hey, any of you guys want to come out and help me fix my father's screen door in Queens?
You tell that son of a bitch no Yankee is ever comin' to Houston. Not as long as you bastards are running things.
I got to get downtown and buy that suit. The store opens in twenty minutes.
Hello? I can take an hour off your hands. Give the kids a chance to see a real live Yankee.
Well, it's kind of a mystery, isn't it?
I dont know how you put up with this.
When I was ten years old, my parents had this very same statue on the mantle of our apartment. Exactly. And, one day, I grabbed it, and I was using it as a microphone. I was singing, MacArthur Park, and I got to the part about, Ill never have that recipe again, and it slipped out of my hand and it broke. My parents looked at me like I smashed the ten commandments. To this day, they bring it up. It was the single most damaging experience in my life, aside from seeing my father naked.
That doesn't explain the lipstick on the dashboard?
With the orange hair, and the big clown shirt with the ruffles...
Alright, what's the difference. What are we gonna do now? He won't take our calls, we can't get into his office...
All righty, no reason for us to uh, raise our voices.
I found it morose. Why dwell on these negative themes?
(to the cashier) Excuse me, I gave you a twenty dollar bill and you only actually gave me change for a ten.
I've done that. Did you ever eat an ostrich burger?
Rudy?! That skunk, I knew he didn't burn those clothes.
I need some water. I gotta get some water.
Pretty chintzy, huh? Considering the money she makes.. She's a big executive for Federal Express.
What happens to charter tickets when you don't use em?
I mean, uh... I had fun ice skating.
I'm at the health club and while I'm in the pool, some guy walks off with my glasses. Who steals prescription glasses?
I needed it! My back is... a little tweaked.
Hi Beth (Scene Ends then re-begins with Beth and George on Beth's couch) Um anyway Jerry told me that uh.. it might have been my comment in the Coffee Shop that broke you up.
I mean , when I said Hello did she say Hello back?
Yeah, and she's going to find I'm a moron. You know, people think I'm smart, but I'm not smart.
He's got a gun! He's got a gun! Get out of the way! (Tries to flee the bar in a mad panic. The audience in the club also goes nuts and heads for the exits. Jerry stands onstage, perplexed.)
Yeah, I know that. (clears throat) Could you start, working?
Oh, this isn't even B.O.! This is *beyond* B.O.! It's *B*.B.O.!
Well, I just had a fight - I need a group dynamic.
Look, why couldn't you make me an architect? You know I always wanted to pretend that I was an architect. Well I-I'm supposed to see her tomorrow, I-I-I'm gonna tell her what's goin on. I mean maybe she just likes me for me.
Hey look a that - boy are you lucky - another great spot - right in front of the hospital. In an emergency yet! How lucky are you huh? Is that unbelievable? How unbelievable is that huh? Come on, give it to me, give it to me.
(Aggravated) Well, I got screwed on the donuts. There were none left. Heh!
You should be the one criticizing me. I, I'm lucky to even know someone like you.
Well why don't you take off your hat and stay awhile.
So what happened? She throw you out? Eh?
(hangs up the phone) That's my toaster. I got to go. Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh!
(depressed) Feel like I can't do anything wrong.
Oh no! Im vigilant. Theyll never get me out. Im like a weed, Jerry.
I always look annoyed. Yeah, when you look annoyed all the time, people think that you're busy. Think about it... (acts annoyed for 3 seconds).
(Scoffs) ARe you kidding? Lincoln Center. Alice Tully Hall, the Met. Magnificent facilities.
Well all right, beautiful, so you stop in. Ya, ya visit the bubble boy for twenty minutes and then we can go.
All right, all right. KNOCK IT OFF. Come on, let's go.
So how long has it been in the basement?
You're Killing Independent George! You know that, don't you?
(with a mouth full of food) This is good. Oh, this is good.
You know, I think we really need to be in front of a television set. You take T.V. out of this relationship, it is *just* torture.
(adamant) Ah, c'mon! I'm telling you, I can coach for the NFL. It's not that hard
Did you see the homeless guy on the library steps screaming obsenities and doing some calesthetics routine
I can't. He's been on my case about not paying attention. Besides, it's too late, I already told him I heard him.
There's gotta be more to life than this. What gives you pleasure?
I think he's saying 'Son of Sam'! Oh, my God!
Sometimes it's good to have a pencil to write these things down.
Let me just say this. It is inhumane to make a man stand on his feet, in one spot for eight hours a day. Why shouldn't he have a chair?
Lemme tell you something, that Jerry Lewis? You wonder how some of these people get to the top? It's ideas like this! Brilliant! Hah-hah! (Notices that the briefcase is damaged.) Look at this - what the hell happened? The whole side is damaged here...and the lock is broken.
Oh. Okay, here it is, I got it. She lost her thumbs in a tractor accident and they grafted her big toes on. They do it every day.
No! I don't! Don't you even care? This is your company! It's your name on the outside of the building! Speaking of which, the 'R' fell off and all it says now is K-uger!
She had this throaty , sexy kind of whisper.
Alright, I'll tell you the truth. I'm not gay. My name's Buck Naked, I'm a porno actor.
I can tell you this. If I am not in front of my house at six-fifteen, when my parents get there, they will put me on an aggravation installment plan that will compound with interest for decades.
A different name for the butler? (Russell throws up again.)
Funny, cause I happen to be very good friends with Keith Hernandez.
uh Tony? there's not gonna be too many sandwiches
(bored to death) Well, I-I just recently uh...
No, you haven't. Well, maybe you have. What do I know.
Yea, ya..ya know I feel terrible about Joey but it's jus..it's a great business opportunity. I-I don't even know how long I'm gonna be away for.
I know I was just telling them the story.
You think your parents would have any objections to taking a little kid to Paris with them? (Jerry looks at him confused) It turns out that the kid's father lives in Paris. (chuckling) Is that a coincidence? (Jerry smilies) Eh you know Alec wants me to take him over there so I figure as long as they're going (claps)
They talk back. They go, "Hey George, how's it going?" I say, "Get the hell out of here!"
Ok, everybody, uh...I have an announcement to make. From now on, I will be known as-
Right. (Mumbles) Nastercoff.. What country is he from, again?
The catering hall screwed up. The wedding is delayed until June. It's like a stay of execution.
They made me buy it.. A hundred bucks this thing cost me. (Gesturing to the book) How dare they?! I got news for you, if it wasn't for the toilet, there would be no books.
THIS is your daughter? My God! My God! I I hope you don't mind my saying. She is breathtaking.
(leaving) Alright that's it for me. Good night everybody.
(to various people as he walks in) Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Hi nice to see you. How are you. Good morning. (to the secretary) Good morning.
(Like a kid) Because I don't want to.
Yeah, yeah, sure, Christmas. Snow. Santa. All that stuff.
Aw, come on. I wanna go see him.
No, no, no, no. Borrowing money from a friend is like having sex. It just completely changes the relationship.
Morning Thunder has caffeine in it, Jerry doesn't drink caffeine.
Where are you living? Are you here? Are you on this planet? It's impossible. It can't be done.
Wait till you hear this! (George sees Donna and no Jerry.) Whoa, ah, Im sorry, I didnt, I had no idea.
This is what my life has come to... Tryin to meet a mute.
Yeah. One second sweetheart. Jerry, I really think it'd be easier if you didn't tuck.
I'm out! Fantastic apartment right across from mine, huh. I can't wait for you to see it.
Hello, it's Natalie? Yeah, this is a business office but I'm not a business man per se. I'm here working for the people. Yes, I'm causing dissent. Stirring the pot. Getting people to question the whole rotten system.
No no no, no mistake, no mistake. No, no , listen, we're going to get married over Christmas, I It doesn't make any difference to me. It's fine. Really.
I keep wracking my brain to try and figure out what I did. I was smart, I was funny, I made great small talk with the waitress so she could see I could relate to the commoners, you know, I'm a man of the people.
I think you're right. You gonna eat that?
Loves bald? (laughs) Wow. Who uh, who is she?
Yeah, well...a little rough finding something good in your price-range. (to Jerry) But you, my friend, may be in luck.
I can't run, I have a bad hamstring.
I didn't do it! It..It just got done. I don't know how it got done, but it did.
Siege mentality, Jerry. They really want me out of here. Theyve downgraded me to some sort of a bunker. Im like Hitlers last days here.
That's a picture of me next to the coffin.
(shaking his head, weary) It doesn't matter. (he leaves)
(still in Jacks voice) I'm working on my Jack Nicholson, You can't handle the truth! (he salutes)
I'm just sayin' I wanna have some fun.
(Holding camera) Look at this, I only have one picture left... How 'bout a shot of me and Mr. Morgan?
You know, my arm feels a lot better. That Wendy really knows her stuff. (he writes out a cheque)
Please, it doesnt look good. Boy, boy, girl.
Yes, Im Sorry, it's a new coat. It-it's Gore-Tex.
Id like a doggie bag for this please. (hands her plate to the waitress)
Christie? That's the one you met in the antique store?
No. I like the ball! This is my One Chance to make a Great Entrance! My whole life! I have never made a great entrance!
Would it kill him to check up on us? No - drops off the meals and that's it. I realize we're prisoners, but we're still entitled to catsup.
Well if you and I ever got into, like a really serious fight you know, and the punches started flying -- who do you think would win?
All right, All right, all, right!!( gives the headphones to Kramer) How you gonna find out who this is?
Okay. (Chewing) Thanks anyway. (Continues to chew as he exits)
Yeah, yeah. He went into the bedroom and started sobbing.
It's like some pod landed from another planet and took your body. Don't fall asleep Elaine.
No no no, this ones different. This ones a beauty!
No, no. I reached down and there was *nothing* there.
Why don't you just look at your watch?
Listen, I have a tremendous favor to ask.
I got a feeling I'm gonna be much smarter than you pretty soon.
(Pleading) You gotta let me go over there.
You wanted a Yankee, I got you a Yankee.
(to Carrie) You know, the thing is, I kinda promised the widow Mantle that I would name my baby Seven.
Do you wanna talk about hotels, or do you wanna win some ball games?
What? Oh I spilled some food on it.
You start flirting with him and I'll come by and, while you're keeping him busy, I'll slip it in his drink.
A backup system? We're designing bathroom doors with our legs exposed in anticipation of the locks not working? That's not a system. That's a complete breakdown of the system.
She's playing a recital this week at the McBierney School. You wanna hear her play? I got two extra tickets, you and Elaine could go...
How hard could it be? You make a little contribution, you have a ceremony. I am going to think about this. I am really going to think about this.
So, uh, Mom, Dad, I was hoping that you could help me to remember my childhood a little clearly..
Wait a second. Think about it. He's not showing up. Wait till you see the line of cabs, its like forty-five minutes long. You said he's in Chicago.
This week. My father got a deal from a friend of his. It's Gore-Tex. You know about Gore-Tex?
Well you see he slipped, and he landed on a kinda of a..
(Definite) I'll take it in my room. (Walks off)
(adamant) Yes I am. I defy you to come up with a better name than Seven.
(excited) Did I tell you that story's relatable?! That was a great show! That is why I'm bringing it back to NBC.
(Again, sarcastic) Oh, what a huge blow to the culture.
(pointing outside) Why is there a Cadillac parked in front of the house?
Well you know there is an unusual number of people in this country having sex with AMPUTEES! (grabs the forum from Kramer and walks over to the clerk) . . . Penthouse forum, newspaper, gum, Clark Bar.
I left it at Heather's. Are these alive? (pounding on glass display)
Why don't they have salsa on the table?
So in order to use these, I gotta spend like fifteen-hundred bucks. This is a bill for fifteen-hundred dollars. Plus, she'd ask about the sleeping arrangements, that whole sleeping arrangement conversation is depressing.
And she slaves to earn every penny. So that someday, I might be able to walk up to a woman and say, "Yes, I'm bald, but I'm still a good person."
Ade, I have to tell you, I, I have never met anybody so ... efficient.
He might as well have! I caught him, and his face was covered in chocolate and cookie crumbs.
By the way, have you spoken to Elaine yet today?
Do me a favor would you? Would you change lanes? Would you get outta this lane. You gotta get out of this lane. This lane stinks. They're all double parked here Please get outta this lane. I'm beggin you please please.
I, I couldn't help but notice that uh you don't have a chair.
This is totally different! That was my secret, this is Jerry's secret! There's...there's attorney-client priveleges here! If I play it by your rule, no one'll ever confide in me again, I'll be cut out of the loop!
This woman left this really sexy message on Jerry's tape recorder......
I told them to meet me in front of my building at six-fifteen.
. . . I'm a little scared of her.
I can't believe that you saw her before me.
"Breakfast At Tiffany's." 90 pages. (Waves a hand like it's nothing.)
Baah! There it is! You just said it! That's what I want! Now say it again, and tell it to me.
Sorry, we're a little late. We got so hung up in traffic.
You think she could be an 'it'? Could she be an 'it'?
Alright. I'll run it by a few people.
Hey, Mr Seinfeld. (shakes Morty's hand) Hey, Mrs Seinfeld. How are you?
(he walks casually to Tom, and taps his arm) Listen. I know we've had our problems in the past, but we got a show to do tonight. Time to pull together as a team. Life's too short. I say, let's let bygones be bygones. If you took the raisins, if you didn't take the raisins-- They weren't even my raisins. I was just curious because it seems like a strange to do to walk into a room, audition, and to walk out with a box of raisins. Anyway, whatever. If you ever want to tell me about it, the door to my office is always opened. In the event that I get an office. You'll come in, we'll talk about the raisins. We'll have a nice laugh.
You're not a doctor. You shouldn't even have books like this.
Oh, right! (Shakes her hand) Right! Hey, hey.. I love the floors in here. It's like a gymnasium in here! Try and guard me! (Dribbles an imaginary ball
Yes, two solariums. Quite a find. And I have horses, too?
No. Youd be surprised. You dont recover that quickly from a nose job.
(resentfully dampened) It's not a prom. It's a Ball.
Uh, I'm just selling some of Dad's things, (looking into Kramer's eyes) that's what he would have wanted.
What did you put the Pez dispenser on her leg for in the first place?
Oh, real good. (George makes a face like you stink) Any word from NBC?
Wait wait wait, what is she... (takes the milk can from Jerry and puts it on the table) What is she like?
Oh uuh, sure, why not. (the blind man hangs on to George's arm) Hey, that's the guy.
Do you know how much this is going to cost me?
(seeing Jerry's van shaking) What is that? That van's a-rockin'.
I'm just happy to be working with your talented son...
(to the waitress bringing his doughnut) And a slice of devil's food cake.
Again with the checked out. I'm not going to the doctor. If I don't to the doctor, then nothing will happen to me. If I go he might find something.
I'm going straight to hell, no two ways about it.
I dont know whatcha had to tell her that for. You put me in a very difficult position, Marine Biologist! I'm very uncomfortable with this whole thing.
I can't go in there. I can't face the bubble boy.
Who am I going to meet who is better than her? No one, Jerry. No one's better than her.
It's a foreign movie... a *film*, is what it is, actually.
Wa, uh, thank you sir, you know I am not quite sure I'm right for it.
Oh geeeee. (George pantomimes sticking a knife in his heart, and twists it.) Go, go!
I had a little tiff with Bonnie about the roommate.
You don't? Boy, I think about it a lot. I think about it at my age. Imagine how much I'll be thinkin' about it at your age. All I'll do is keep thinkin' about it until it drives me insane...
Why can't we do this on the phone? What's Kramer doing now?
(talking on the phone) Jerry you gotta bring me some clothes down here. I lost my job with the Yankees. I'm standing in the men's room on 43rd street in my underpants.
I'm very nervous about this. I've never spoken to a mental patient before.
Ah, ...A beautiful successful intelligent woman's in love with me and I throw it all away. uh oh boy. Now I'll spend the rest of my life living alone. I'll sit in my disgusting little apartment watching basketball games, eating Chinese take out. Walking around with no underwear. Because I'm too lazy to do a laundry.
'My wife's in a coma.' Yeah? Well, the life support machine called and...
Let me ask you something. What do you do for a living, Newman?
Yes and I was hoping ... to get a thirteen week extension.
She's working late that night. We're - were supposed to have dinner with everybody at eight o'clock so I'll set up the ride for seven o'clock.
Danielle. Where's Neil? (indicating the bed) Is this him?
She just dislikes me so much... It's irresistable.
Excuse me. Am I talking to you, Pinhead? Am I?!
I've just met her but I'm very impressed.
I didn't even know it was a job.
Sometimes at restaurants she talks to her food 'Ooh, Mr. Mashed Potatoes, you are sooo goood.'
No... (takes off his glasses and wipes his eyes with his sleeve)
Just tell her whatcha want, they'll make it for ya.
It's OK. It's fine. She'll do it. I'm sure she'll still do it.
(spits out mouthful of food) Mrs. Enright! Mrs. Enright!
How are you closer to him than me?
This is a crude mock-up of the conference room. 1/14th scale.
She told this couple she had an affair with a matador.
(Losing it) I guess everyone here enjoys giving the old screwgie, huh?! Youre all doin a hell of a job! (Looks longingly at the Twix in the machine) Ho, ho. What I would do with you..
(Laughs, snorts) I said, I said 'Get outta here! No story? Is that what I said?'
The second time I sent the noodles back, I tought she made a face...
Good. Cause if this is a lie, if this is a joke, if this is your idea of some cute little game we're finished!
(To the store owner) Excuse me, what do you think of these?
I bought a new recliner with a fridge build right in to it.
Yup. It's really just a question of what kind. Thinking about a bar stool.
You know how easy it is for dead people to travel? Its not like getting on a bus. One second. (snaps his fingers) Its all mental.
No (snorts - Laughing nervously)... I'm gonna wear black shoes.
Yeah. You could base a character on me.
(resolved) Why not. (determined) If she can't find me, she can't break up with me. And, if we're still goin' out, she has to gooo to the ballll.
Oh, well, so what? Laughter - what is that? I mean, what is the point of opening your mouth and going "Ha, ha!"? What is that? "Ha, ha!"?
You're a very handsome man, by the way.
You know it's a public phone, you're not supposed to just chit-chat.
Yeah. Not only that, this is what she said to me, "Can we change the subject?"
Alright I happen to know what they did last night, they had dinner with Kramer.
No, I brought a picture of the chair.
So? For a twenty-five dollar cleaning, I can listen to some pointless blather.
(gleeful) Hehee. W..we could be like the Gatsbys. Didn't they always like, you know, a bunch of people around, and they were all best friends?
No, that's a fair question. It is, uhm... (nervous chuckle) Jerry, yeah. (to Cynthia) Jerry's a friend of mine. (to Russell) He uh, he gave it to me. Unbelievable how many addresses of people this guy has.
Whooo.. (To a waitress taking orders) Ooh.. French fries.
"Arrrrrrgh!! .. It's George.. Oh! Sports wholesaler. yeah. yeah. .. thanks for calling back. No , no , no still got the shoes, still got the shoes. Lots of them. This is.. beautiful athletic gear."
Ah, Pfft! What can you do? (looking at a tag on the suit) Is this the price tag?
No. I wouldnt even have to tell her. I could surprise her.
Oh, yes. I already packed up my desk, sir. I can be outta here in an hour.
Well then...then you really have something to think about because.....you know if there's any doubt in your mind ....and.. and,, it doesn't even have to be a big doubt, you know even a tiny doubt, a DOT of a doubt.. and.....
Mrs. Sweedler thank you. Y-You see, this tragedy affected me in a very, very personal way.
They're all the same. You go, you sit, you eat popcorn, you watch. I'm sick of it.
Could there be a native p0roblem in the Caymans? Maybe theres native unrest.
Well, I got just the thing to cheer you up. A computer! Huh? We can check porn, and stock quotes.
Well, I gotta do somethin'. (Walks over to bathroom. Kramer enters)
Honesty, hard-work, these are the values that I was raised on. The most important thing Joey, is to be able to look yourself in the mirror before you go to sleep at night.
At the funeral, give or take. You know, deep down, I always kinda felt that they blamed me for Susan's death.
She hasn't seen the article! When she sees it, she's gonna think-- *I'm out baby*!! I'm out!!!!!
(to Jerry) Huh-ho! Have you ever seen anything like this?
You met her at the supermarket? How did you do that?
No I didn't mean to imply that you did. You're obviously a very well proportioned individual. I was just wondering, have they ever offered you a chair?
Me run in? Why don't you run in?
Kramer! You can't go! Who's gonna do the feats of strength?
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. As long as youre going to lie to the guy, why dont you tell him that you lost both of the tickets, then we can go?
Because of the day before. It's a long story.
Excuse me, I'm sorry to bother you, I noticed that you have a textbook on tape. May I ask where you got that?
He had a TV show! He had cartoons!
I know, they're out of their minds! It's fantastic!
I don't have a spare set. All my keys say 'do not duplicate'.
I don't know, I just can't. Nobody in my family can pay for parking, it's a sickness. My father never paid for parking; my mother, my brother, nobody. We can't do it.
(Not amused with her answer) Eggs are eggs. That is very profound. (laughs; Daphne goes back to reading her paper) By the same token you could say fish is fish. Ha ha ha, I don't think so. (pauses) Listen Dophne
Guess who he put in charge of Fitted Hat Day? Me.
That's right, you heard me. Get out! You are ruining this whole experience for me!
All right, no more lies. Elaine is been chosen to represent the Upper West Side in the next Biosphere project.
(Looking at her nose) Is your nose pierced?
What? I'm not eating bread now. I'm off bread.
Well, it doesn't even have to be the general manager. Maybe I could be like, an announcer. Like a color man. You know how I always make those interesting comments during the game.
Well, if I could talk to the mothers and have sex with the daughters, then I'd really have something goin'.
[to himself] Argh! [to Susan] Susan! Hi! Oh, boy! What are you doing here?!
You know what word Susan used last night? Hnuh. Vault! hu,
Oh, Scott, Scott. He's really great, isn't he?
I got two tickets to see "Guys And Dolls".
Aw, well, you know, it's your anniversary. It's - it's the least I can do. I - I just want you guys to go out and have a good time. Ha ha. So, you think we should, uh, we should get downstairs?
All right, uh, okay, I got it, um, Ill sing.
What do you mean? The engagement is off, we get the TV back. That's business.
The last time I saw her, she was naked.
Sweet guy (Receives the phone from Beth, Starts to talk to Jerry) Hello
What do I do?! What do I do?!
I know enough to stay away from it.
I can't eat with you leanin' over like this. Just look straight forward.
It says very clearly, 'for your protection, do not give your secret code to anyone.'
(smiling) Well, we're certainly glad that you could make it.
Now Peterman wants me to go to the funeral.
Um, all right, um, uh, I'll call 'ya. I'll call you and we'll talk on the phone. A telephone communiqu. Every thing is fine ok, uh, fine, .. [exits]
Eh, there's that woman that never talks to anybody.
Jiffy Park. It's incredible.. Seventy-five dollars a month.
No, I'm not. I would like to be, but I'm not. What am I gonna do? The book club meets in a few days.
Well I just got back from swimming in the pool. And the water was cold...
You see (to Jerry). You see. You see what Im talking about. It's all just slipping away. And you're letting it happen. (exits -- slamming the door)
I noticed people staring at my head because they like what they see.
Yeah, as a matter of fact, I did.
We had an incredible phone conversation. We talked for like twenty minutes. I threw away my notes in the middle of the call. You know, I thought she had a great voice timbre. Is it timbre or tamber?
I meet this women, Sheila. She works down at the one hour photo pace. She's got this incredible smile. Like she's got extra teeth or something
(shaking hands with Morty) Morty, always a pleasure.
You know, I'm sorry, I...I hate to be one of those people, but we're right in the middle of this thing...I can't hear.
I-I just don't react well to these situations. My grandmother died two months early because of the way I reacted in the hospital. She was getting' better. And then I went to pay her a visit. She saw my face. BOOM. That was the end of it.
Fine. Excellent. Could you do me a favor? Could you not tuck the blankets in? 'Cause I can't sleep all tucked in.
I cant believe how easy it is. Im virtually Orthodox. All I have to do is read a few books, memorize a few prayers, and Im in the club.
Does the heater even work in this car?
Coffees coffee in the morning. Its not coffee at twelve oclock at night.
You know my last name is Costanza. That's Italian. So you and I are like country men. Pisano's!
No, no, no, I dont want to carry it around all night. Ill pick it up later.
So what's the deal they don't want to have dinner with my parents?
I am never saying 'I love you' again unless they say it first.
Nothing really, you know...just eh, stroll around the cell blocks, maybe eh, take in a shower fight. (chuckles.) Hey eh, you know you got a bounced check hanging up in the little market over on Columbus?
Aw, Mr. Kruger, Sir. Merry Christmas! (Hands him a card)
What was wrong with that sorry? It was a good sorry. Jerry, was that a good sorry?
Now if I wanna see anything I gotta wear these.
I find the soothing pastorial images very conduc-
Do you feel funny? He didn't say anything.
(Reading the card from Whatley) "This holiday season a donation has been made in your name to the Children's Alliance."?
Yeah, I'll zip in, "How do you do?", zip out. She'll love me.
Do you see what this is turning in to? Do I need this. I have to get out of this thing.
Hey, I'm sorry, you had your buffer zone for many years. It's my turn to live, baby.
Oh, I can't believe you're dropping out, too. So now Kramer and I have to pay for the entire gift?
Just do it like a Band-Aid. One motion. Right off! (beat) She is sexy though. Dont you think?
We cant just let him get away with this.
Anything, everything, something, nothing - Who the hell cares? Put me down. I'm down!
Deeply in love. If you can't say anything bad about a relationship, you shouldn't say anything at all.
You must be very proud Mr. Visaki. (shaking his hand) And may I say sir they're lovely girls, absolutely lovely girls. It's nice to see such fine upstanding women in gainful employment, Mr. Visaki.
(wiping the area with a hand) People think they're so important...
Really? I never heard of a semi (the "i" sounds like an "e") tractor-trailer. (Jerry nods in agreement)
Yeah. Just take 'em out and ride 'em around for about..half an hour.
(glances upwards) Yeah. Uhm, why did she die so young?
She knows that I have her clock. I know that she has my hat. I think she's getting ready to make an exchange.
(pointing to Jerry in joyous agreement) Ha-ha-hah. This is my lucky day.
Oxygen! I need some oxygen! This is major.
(Wanting Elaine to take it off his hands, he tries to silence Jerry) Jerry, simmer down.
all right! rock-climbing! J..just the 2 of us? alright! hey I'll make some sandwiches, what what do you like? tuna? peanut butter?
In every situation. No matter how silly I look. (Tastes his Clams Casino) Hm.. tastes a little funky.
(in his mind) I think that ginger ale at the coffee shop is just Coke and Sprite mixed together. How can I prove it? Ah! Can't, dammit. (knock at door. George goes to open it)
Let me ask you something. What do you think of this shirt?
Wait a second. I think I see where that laser guy is. No! Don't look! Don't look. Oh, yeah, that's him. Ok. I'm gonna sneak up on him. Now the hunted becomes the hunter.
You know that coat was Gore-Tex. Its worth a hell of a lot more than that, cheap Chardonnay.
He's giving you furniture? Who is this guy?
Exactly! You know how they get animals to reproduce in captivity? They just put them in the same cage.
(Heavily sarcastic. He's angered at Jerry) Good one. Very funny. You're very funny, Jerry. That's what I always tell people. (Yelling out) Jerry Seinfeld's a funny guy!
Well perhaps, not to the extent that you are. But I know the basic plot. Yeah.
Why do they have to do that in front of people?
Well, maybe it was Ghostbusters? Where ever it was, it worked!
Now, I'm aware that my own physical dimensions are perhaps a little short of perfection.
I had a great time tonight Carrie. And I am going to call you as soon as I get home.
Susan B. Anthony** I think I'd have a problem with.
Oh no - I'm so sorry, it's the Moops. The correct answer is the Moops.
(to Jerry) "You know those shoes that Jimmy had? I cut a deal with him. We're gonna import a case of them together."
No no no no no, this has to be carefully orchestrated. You go to a fancy dinner, flowers...
The guy that stole my glasses. This time I got 'em! (George follows the man onto the street, dragging the blind man with him) Would you pick it up a little?
You're right. Why must there always be a problem? You'd think just once I could get a break. God knows I earned it with that score!
(after Wendy and to the receptionist) Oh, you have a policy! (to the world at large) The delicate genius has a policy! George heads for the door.
Hey, don't embarrass me today. I got some friends in the stands. (George makes a swinging motion with an imaginary bat and pulls something in his back.)
What are you doing? Where do you think you're going?
Yes she is. It's a pity we won't be seeing much more of her.
What is it about sex that just disrupts everything? Is it the touching? Is it the nudity?
You met her a few weeks ago, but...?
No, that's not enough BTUs for my living room...That was a complete waste of time.
Would you get out of here. Who's gonna turn down a chair? I would be very interested to know how he felt about all of this. Maybe I'll have a talk with him.
Hey! Did 'ya ever do that thing on the toes that I said .
Wait a second, wait a second, what coming in, what woman is coming in?
Let's see, How I'm very good at going in reverse in my car, why isn't Postum a more popular drink,
I think you absolutely have to say something to this guy. Confront him.
It moved! It was imperceptible but I-I felt it.
(to Mickey) Can't you just switch with another Midget?
Well, I do what I can. (Robin comes over.)
I am such a Huge whale fan. These marine biologists were showin' how they communicate with each other with these squeaks and squeals, what a fish!
I mean it's hard enough to meet a woman you dislike, much less like.
( rubbing his eye) Ow, Ow you squirted me.
Yeah, I mentioned Simons. Next thing I know, Im in the parking lot. Perhaps they had some sort of a falling out. Ill tell you one thing. I dont know what hes got. But for a sick guy, hes very strong.
(Puts nuts into his mouth, and in the process covers his mouth) We bring her to the party, and she can tell me what Gwen is saying about me.
No. I am not giving my code to anyone for any reason.
What's the difference you just read it and mail it right back. These we'll do.
Yeah, well I uh got lots of other stuff to show you too. Wait till you see the plum job that I landed.
She invited me up. Coffees not coffee, coffee is sex.
When are you going on your next date with her?
(surprising his parents in the kitchen) Welcome back.
I thought you said he was gonna get a muffin.
(Anyway,) on the left--exquisite marble! High ceilings. An' a flush, like a jet engine! (imitates sound) Ha ha!
Are you going to help me or not?
Sid, who's gonna move the cars while you're away?
How much are we gonna get for this? Fifty, sixty thousand?
You're not goin to do it? What do you mean, You're not goin to do it?
Hate those couples. I could never bee one of those couples. There are no bald woman around. You know?
And then in the fifth inning, why did you take off on the pop fly?
Hey, when you order from the waitress, get her to point to the menu. I want to see what finger she uses.
Well, Jerry's car gets hit and the other driver doesn't have any insurance, so the judge
(more excitement) You were gonna fix me up with her?
Yes, yes of course. The Pensky file. Ho ho, can't wait to sink my teeth into that. Wow that Pensky. Well we'll straighten him out.
Cold? How are you going to do that? You're not one of those guys.
So let's say in her mind she witnessed a pick. Okay, so then what?
No, I'm gonna hold it under her nose so she can smell the scent of stale Bosco that I had to live with for three years, and I'm gonna say, "Remember this shirt, baby?! Well, now, it's payback time!"
People can drop change down here, Jerry. And theyre too lazy to pick it up.
Because if I watch it at my apartment I feel like I'm not doing anything. If I watch it here, I'm out of the house; I'm doing something.
(con't) A-Anyway, I was thinking we would take two cars up to the cabin and that way if one of wanted to stay you know...
Yeah. I may have stepped on her arm, too, I don't know.
Alright! Please, please! I cannot have this constant bickering!.. Stress is very damaging to the epidermis! Now, I have an important photo session in the morning - my hands have got to be in tip-top shape, so please - keep the television down, and the conversation to a minimum.
Really? You like it? I got it at a flea market today.
Of course I mean that. I am incapable of guile.
Excuse me, I've got a maniac stalking me, I'm not staying in the city.
My parents? They don't know *what's* goin' on...
On-the-street cell-phone call is the lowest phone call you can make.
You know I uh, spilled a yogurt smoothie in here two days ago. Hm, Can't smell anything, can ya?
(to the cab driver) Excuse me, do you see anything on my lip here?
Aw, that's a fun age. (Jerry looks at George distastefully.)
Well, maybe she decided to celebrate her birthday on the Monday after the weekend.
Here, just give me a couple of napkins.
(to Susan's stone) ...And then, right after the All-Star Break, we, we just swept the Orioles. Four games. In Baltimore. (adjusts necktie nervously) So... yeah.
The door? Why would I go out the door? The window's right here.
How come this sweater is only 85 dollars?
I don't know. I don't wanna be one of those guys.
Not with that big glass window looking out into the hall. I'd love a good nap. That's the only thing getting me out of bed in the morning. I'll see ya'.
Hunh, pph (raises hands slightly, in amazement) How was it?
All right, you know you're not any help at all here. I don't know what even the point is of talking to you anymore.
There's elevators all over! It all looks the same.
Of course not! Wash it, dry it, move on!
I, uh, should have a poem very soon now.
That's David Letterman. I just saw David Letterman walk by. I'll be right back. (He exits)
(excited) Ho ho! (gestures and steps towards bedroom but Loretta walks the other way to the couch)
Oh, these are my friends, Elaine and Jerry, ... Noel
Jerry, I felt like a straight man in some horrible sketch. He was riffing! Riffing! On my pain!
(Once again, still on the shower) Could it be lukewarm?
Alright, let's see, let's see. What else. What else. Oh yeah, what does she do?
Hey, I know what I'm talking about. I gotta be honest with you, I gotta tell ya... Ever since I saw you holding hands with that woman, I can't get you out of my mind.
Her roommate. I've driven women to lesbianism before but never to a mental institution.
I was quoting him. Why would I be insulted? I'm never insulted. You could call me baldy, dump soup on my head. Nothing insults me.
Well, I didn't think anyone would play it.
Just dropped in for a visit. You, uh, you never called me back.
...you'll see, things will be different now - if you just give me one more chance.
"BECAUSE IF HE CAN'T JUMP. THERE GOES MY SNEAKER BUSINESS!!"
I knew I had hit my high note so I thanked the crowd and I was gone.
Well, I assume there's some sort of write-off.
Hey uh, isn't Elaine supposed to meet us?
...and, and maybe shell see me when she gets there, does this woman intend to spend time with me?
I know, I know and you know *why* they're moving there?
Yes I look forward to many years of... looking at the triangles. Well, I'll ah, I'll wait for you outside.
Yeah, good luck. Hey I'll meet you outside.
Pst. (moves in close with Elaine and Jerry) Wilkinsons got a bite on a new one. Petramco Corp. Out of, uh Springfield. I think. Theyre about to introduce some sort of a robot butcher.
So what, what is so bad about that?
What if he left you a used Kleenex, what's that, a valentine? Now you go up to him and you tell him that if he's thinking of turning me in, that I got the goods on him!
Listen, I gotta ask you I was a little concerned that perhaps I was responsible in some way for your, uh... metamorphosis.
Yes! I'm not giving him the satisfaction, it's my space.
Excuse me. Can I talk to you for a second there, Watkins?
Of course you will. (quick chuckle). You're the best. (with a light fist motion across her chin)
But I know who took the bite. It was her aunt!
You remember my cousin Rhisa? I'm gonna date her.
He mentioned my name?! What did he say?!
You know it must be impossible for a Spanish person to order seltzer and not get salsa. (Angry) "I wanted seltzer, not salsa."
They wish. I hate the big broker-houses. Hate them with a passion. Big broker-houses killed my father.
You know, you know what's great about our relationship?...It's not about looks.
I think I'd be good at that. I talk to people all the time. Someone even told me once they thought I'd be a good talk show host.
I'll try some on and see how they look. It's just hair.
Well, at least we know the prosthetic squirrel hips work ... sorry bout the set.
Jerry, let me tell you something, "A man without hand is not a man." I got so much hand I'm coming out of my gloves. I got to thank Kramer.
They refuse to put cucumber in the salad. I need cucumber.
Hey Elaine. (George hangs up his raincoat next to the door) Im telling you Jerry, having a secretary is incredible. (George claps hands) I don't know why I didnt have one before.
All right, just gimme that. And gimme some of those Sweet & Lows.
Well how could you just play your message in front of anybody?
I've done the march in. Best feeling in the world.
'Kay. I'll uh, I'll see you later. Anybody want some tomatoes?
My moneys all tied up in change right now.
So what have you been doing with yourself?
(Puts his hands on his face, rubbing his eyes) Look. It's a skill, just like juggling. She probably enjoys showing it off.
A guy leaves a puddle of sweat, that's a signal?
I don't know what Newman wanted to see me for.
So what? What am I supposed to do?
I told you, he probably went out the back.
Well, you know... the friend meeting the new woman. I feel like I'm getting fixed up for a friendship.
(Loud, so everyone at the wedding can hear) You slept with the groom?!
Up again?! This is incredible! Im.. Im getting it.
Yes, sir, that was a good sandwich, sir.
(interrupts her) You know what. I don't think I'm going to be able to stay over tonight.
Faking? What makes you think that I have time to see doctors, take X-rays, make appointments, when there's absolutely nothing wrong with me? What kind of a person would do a thing like that?
(Silently squinches his mouth and nods at Kramer)
Did you happen to notice that Julie handed the big salad to Elaine?
(not expecting the statue to be thrown) Dit.
You can't do that, it's none of your business!
You know, it's a miracle you're not married. (beat) Hey, I'm not obligated to buy anything, am I?
Hey, Ring Dings are better than anything you're gonna get at a bakery.
You disappoint me, my friend. Sandy wants nothing to do with you. She tells Laura, "If you want to waste your time with that pervert, that's your problem."
Well bear in mind that I am in the smaller office.
Well, you know. You get to a certain point, you wanna know about your roots.
It was on a magazine! And it still had the doily on.
What, did you go swimmin'? It's 29 degrees out!
Well, you got no place to go. I'll tell you what your problem is You brought your queen out too fast. What do you think? She's one of these feminists looking to get out of the house? No, the queen is old fashioned. . Likes to stay home. Cook. Take care of her man. Make sure he feels good.
(animated) Are you insane? Jerk store, woulda smoked that guy! Smoked him, I say.
Oh my God! (coming out of bathroom) You know what I just realized?! If they get divorced an' live in two separate places? That's twice as many visits!
(animated) N..no, no. You can't leave me. (frantic) Marry me! I'll burn myself. I'll burn my parents!
I had to listen to a five minute discussion on which one is actually called shmoopy.
Hey, you know, we haven't brought the Elaine character into the show yet. Umm, We should try and get her into this scene.
Well, Jerry, I been thinkin'. I've gotten as far as I can go with George Costanza.
Oh, I wanted to talk to you--I'm sorry, I--didn't know you... (re Donna) had company. (Jerry indicates he should stay) Hiya, I'm George.
What do I do? Well actually, I'm a writer. In fact, I'm writing a comedy pilot for NBC right now.
Oh, yes I am. Mr. Thomassoulo likes to play dirty. Well, theres nothing dirtier than a giant ball of oil.
(Trying to whisper to Jerry) Look, we are gonna settle this right now! I demand reparations! I should get to sleep with Elaine. That's the only way to punish you!
Eh, they're trying to pick out a new couch - you don't want to know. (Remembering the watching Van Buren Boys) Give me your wallet, or I'll spill your guts right here on the street!
Wait, wait wait, not so fast. Jerry, you gotta take me to get this thing refinished.
Jerry, would you do me a favor, close the window.
(PULLING OUT ESTIMATE OUT OF HIS POCKET) Well, profit. I think you'll see from the estimate that I'm not really profiting that much. They might be a little high, but..
I went in with a pretty woman? You know, kinda short, big wall o' hair, face like a frying pan?
What if her experience with me *drove* her to it?
Could I, uh, could I trade you for another dollar?
Hehehehehe (higher tone laugh, though still quietly )
Anyway, right in the middle, the ship blows up-- burning debris, bodies falling-- and then just as this eerie silence settles over the airfield, I yelled out, "That's gotta hurt!"
Where? (He looks out window and gets hit by a tomato)
All right, shes not even gonna ask, if we see her, which is remote.
They were in here, I saw her put 'em in here!
Care? Forget about care. Love. They have to love the characters. Otherwise, why would they keep tuning in?
Ah-Ha! (he turns and walks over to the refrigerator)
Like if she wants to know if I'm pleased with something, she'll say, "Happy, Pappy?"
Kramer goes to a fantasy camp. His whole life is a fantasy camp. People should plunk down two-thousand dollars to live like him for a week. Do nothing, fall ass-backwards into money, mooch food off your neighbors and have sex without dating; that's a fantasy camp.
Well I just stomped some pigeons in the park. They - they didn't move.
(ON PHONE) It's a '76 Chevy Impala. They stole it right in front of the hospital. I saw the guy drive off in it. Well he's about five feet tall, hairless, pink complexion.. (Elaine puts her finger on her nose) looks like a pig. Yeah, alright alright, thank you, thank you. (Kramer enters) So any word from the "pig-man"?
No, no. Deena, it's not what you think.
The cashier is at lunch - which is where Id like to be.
All right. There's nothing to be worried about. She's just a little annoyed right now. Tomorrow I'll personally go over there. I'll apologize. I'll get the papers. Don't worry. Don't worry. (exits)
Elaine, I once told a woman that I coined the phrase, "Pardon my French."
She put them in her pocketbook. I guess she took them with her.
(getting up out of his chair to get out of the Mohel's way) No, No.
(singing) Oh hey, if you happen to see the most beautiful girl who walked out on me. Tell her I'm sorry. Tell her I need my baby ... oh won't you tell her ... I love her. Oh hey, ...
(putting the car in reverse) Oh beautiful! Look at that, the dream space right in front of Jerry's building. Huh? Dreams can come true, what did I tell you?
Seriously, have they though about changing the setting?
Gee, Kramer, I uh...I don't know what to say.
Psh. What's the point of even discussing it? [condescendingly takes her hand and pats it] You'll give me the money when you have it. [takes two steps, then reconsiders, then re-reconsiders] I, I trust you.
I never should have brought her up there. Should have known better. Should have seen it coming. I didn't see it coming.
All right! All right. I'll tell you what. How about this? Got the date; March 21st, the first day of spring.
I could have had some ice cream. I think that might have calmed down the nachos.
Cause its signals, Jerry, its signals! (snapping his fingers) Dont you- all right. Did she even ask you, what you were doin tomorrow night, if you were busy?
. All right , just give me my car and let me get the hell out of here.
Oh No nonono I'm not a cop ...Heum... I work for the Yankees.
Kramer, what the hell are you talking about?
Yeah, Like I don't know that I'm pathetic.
Yes. I like to feel cozy. I have a very small apartment. I like to feel tucked in, nestled in. Love to be nestled.
Well...maybe not as much as this bastard... (points at Zeke, they all laugh) I can hold my own! (they all continue laughing and drinking)
Would you excuse us for a minute Tim boy, we're kind of in the middle of something.
No, I-I-I know... [retreats back to his Chinese take out] I know...
Well, whoever he was, he knew a lot about The A-Team!
She's been locked up for two years. She's gonna want to make up for lost time. Dinners. Movies. (Rubs his forehead.) Talking...
And why shouldn't you? Be fresh Stay fresh
The guy slept with Marilyn Monroe, he's in Dinky Donuts. What about this doctor's note? Let's go see your friend Roy.
I cant stand doing laundry. Thats why I have forty pairs of underwear.
(hearing Elaine over the phone) What, she's out?
All right, believe me, you're not going to marry him.
Atlantic City? (thinks) Yes! Yes! I will go to Atlantic City. I'm in. I'm down.
Tsst...'Course I have. Come on. My cousin's in a bubble. My friend Jeffrey's uh, sister, also ... bubble ... you know. I got a lot of bubble experience. Come on.
(to Jerry) You watch the old videos. (insistent) I'm telling you, look at him.
Did you feel that tension? We use to have banter - (puts menu back with frustration) - there's no more banter.
