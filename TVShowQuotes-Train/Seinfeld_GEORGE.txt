What?
From NBC?
Tell the cop.
What, like at a bus stop?
I went in with a pretty woman? You know, kinda short, big wall o' hair, face like a frying pan?
Yes I did.
Get up, get up, its her! Oh, the hell with this, Im scared to death, just walk away, its off, cancel everything, go!
I'm writin' it. "How's it going?"
Yeah, good, good.
You think she's happy?
I'm serious.
It stinks.
So what, what is so bad about that?
Jerry, can we get out of here?!
It's worth a shot. (Goes to the door.)
Well, Danielle, (digs in his pocket) we should get going. I got a key made for you.
You didn't find it funny?! This is what I'm paying for?
From my pocket.
Physical therapy is covered by insurance?
The closet business? What's the closet business?
Okay. Good.
All right, okay. Let's go, details.
So, how come nothing ever happened between you and Nina? (Getting paranoid) Is there a problem with her? Is she a man?
Seriously, have they though about changing the setting?
Alright, thanks a lot.
It will be my first one.
Do you think chickens have individual personalities?
No.
Aw right YES! GUM! Good enough I'll take it.
Alright, so I haven't put anything in it since sixth grade, I completely forgot about it. The State Controller's Office tracks me down. The interest has accumulated to 1,900 dollars. 1,900 dollars! They're sending me a cheque!
Why not?
Come on, Kramer.
Well, I'm mentioning his name.
Yeah, with crutches everyone has questions.
(shifty) Yeah.
What?
What about Six?
Oh, no, nothing.
Ive had a lot of other paranormal stuff happen to me.
Jerry, Jerry
[embarrassed pause] ``Rochelle, Rochelle''.
Don't you see? I'm back in.
You're out?
(sitting down) Where's Hanke?
Excuse me...huh... I think I made a big mistake. I'd like my deposit back please.
(Scoffs) No, I told you, I'm not gonna do that.
Listen Sheila it's not what you think. I put my trust into the wrong person. He said the key word was tasteful.
Then, the last person to leave is Wilhelm. He sees my car, he figures I'm burning the midnight oil. Between the two of them, they think I'm working an 18 hour day! (he stands there with his hands on his hips, a wide grin - laughing.)
It's all your fault! You and Elaine! All that orgasm talk. She did have an orgasm, she didn't have an orgasm. Orgasm this, orgasm that. I got so focused on it. I started to panic and boom, I lost it. I tried everything, I was talking to him 'Please wake up, do something.'
Oh, n-no comparison.
Hey, go.
Well how do you even know its hers? Maybe it belonged to Carol. Did you see a name on the tube?
You're Murphy!! Look, let's just jump out of the car.
You're calling her?
Yup, y'know, they really spruce up the apartment.
The cashier is at lunch - which is where Id like to be.
Jerry did you wash this pear?
Where's the remote phone?
Monica, I'm really focused here, this stuff's a killer. (turns to the next page)
So what? Thats good.
Jerry Lewis?
What?!
Quick for a... catered affair.
Great. Jerry, I gotta tell you, I had the BEST TIME with that Nina last night. I - I think I'm in love with her already. You are a great friend. (Hugs Jerry) A great, great friend.
A mute would be good.
I'm trying, dammit.
Slippery Pete. Kramer, hurry up!
No its a regular religion.
Jerry. I can't get fired.
Still marry , still marry.
So you're buying the car back for your parents?
Oh my God it is them.
She had this throaty , sexy kind of whisper.
Just for these sponges?
This is our new Vice-president of Acquisitions, sir.
Hey.
That's my vow to you.
Okay, we'll go!
(Heavily sarcastic. He's angered at Jerry) Good one. Very funny. You're very funny, Jerry. That's what I always tell people. (Yelling out) Jerry Seinfeld's a funny guy!
51 people?! That's it?! I thought it was, like, a thousand!
Soooooo
(still in Jacks voice) I'm working on my Jack Nicholson, You can't handle the truth! (he salutes)
Good, let her think it.
Oh, right, right, the intervention. Should we leave?
Oh, I was trying to make a point.
The one who always sits by herself?
Well, I guess these would be out of the question. (pulls out two pudding skins in plastic bags.)
What are we gonna tell her?
(Boiling) What am I going to say?!
I think she wants me to take her home.
Shoplifting.
He's alright?
(ignoring Jerry) I mean I'm not really working right now.
Why does it always seem like I'm the only one working at this break-up?
Well nothing. I didn't actually say that. (Karen is still laughing)
Jerry, let me tell you something, "A man without hand is not a man." I got so much hand I'm coming out of my gloves. I got to thank Kramer.
Babs left?
Yeah, six weeks.
Then I asked her if she wanted a drink.
Well, I still don't know what I'm supposed to do. I don't even know what my assignment is.
You cant be serious. This is New York city. There must be eleven million decent hotel rooms! Whatta you need? A flag? (waving his handkerchief) This is the signal, Jerry, this is the signal!
All this in 5 days. Hmm.
Elaine, huh... Peterman account?
Why does everything have to be 'us'? Is there no 'me' left? Why can't there be some things just for me? Is that so selfish?
Nooo...
Yes. Very nice to have had her to mention... (starting to leave)
(internally) How am I gonna get out of this? Think Costanza, think!
What did you do here? You took out the wrong guy.
Kramer?!
She's like a district attorney. If it's not the truth, I'll break under the cross. I actually have to do it.
Pauline? . . . Wait a minute. I got it. My brother once impregnated a woman named Pauline.
What the hell happened?
Elaines moving into your building?
If youre having second thoughts, if you didnt want it, dont worry about it because uh, you know, I, I...I could take it, you know.
I can tell you this. If I am not in front of my house at six-fifteen, when my parents get there, they will put me on an aggravation installment plan that will compound with interest for decades.
That's unbelievable!
Stop it, stop it! It's not fair. It's not fair. I don't like this situation, Jerry. I don't like it one bit.
Well, so much for purification week.
Yeah.
What are you? A *baby*!? All right. Tell her.
You know what? it's better than Elaine's, too. I gotta give her a call. (Moves tward the phone)
Not that Im aware of, no.
We hardly read anything!
We got a deal.
Oh Jerry, that is so sweet of you but actually i already ate.
The doc called and said the lab's backed up and now I'm not gonna get the results for another two days.
Oh, right. Oh no, man.
It's a little unusual. So, uh, Susan and I were thinking, uh, dinner at our house Saturday night. Just the four of us.
Jerry took the flyers off the car, I got the whole thing covered.
What trip? You were gone?
Peter Jennings had one.
I guarantee you that Moses was a picker. You wander throughh the desert for forty years with that dry air. ... You telling me you're not going to have occasion to clean house a little bit.
What's to think about? If Putty says it's what it is, it's what it is. He's not gonna cheat you.
Whose are these?
Hey, starving! (Grabs the box from Jerry)
I don't know, she said she had to pick up a friend of hers at the airport. It cost me a hundred dollars this ticket.
40? I'm payin' 60 to my maid. She doesn't do laundry and I'm gettin' nothin'. All right. Once she pinched my ass, but I don't know what that was.
La-la Land. I got the window seat, right?
I know. I know.
We're not stealing it.
Well, Play Now is through playing. They turned the heat way up in my office. They tried to sweat me out.
What, what happened? Where's, where's all the stuff?
You don't have your own camera.
I lost it.
So, uh...wanna double?
They talk back. They go, "Hey George, how's it going?" I say, "Get the hell out of here!"
Because the underwear is pulled up from the back and ... it wedges in..
I-I-I can't find my glasses.
Hey. Check these out. I just picked them up from Sheila. She must have loved these.
Oh, would ya stop worrying?
I'm not getting a Penthouse Forum.
(Frantically) Jerry, Jerry?
Celia? W-w-what are you doing here?
I need to look for my glasses.
Nah.
With extreme prejudice.
No, never mind.
He called in sick.
Just do it like a Band-Aid. One motion. Right off! (beat) She is sexy though. Dont you think?
And a guy will appear from out of nowhere. I say "Get out of here! What do you want? You don't belong here!"
That's the question, Jimmy.
I'm a bootlegger.
No, Julie, Julie, don't insult me. You know, what difference does it make who pays for lunch. It's totally meaningless.
Oh, thanks, Bobby. (To Celia) Well, I guess I'll see you in four days.
Ben Cantwell. 85. Huh... You think we'll make it to that age?
Jiffy Park. It's incredible.. Seventy-five dollars a month.
Alright look, I'm gonna tell you, but I made a pact with Cynthia, we swore we were not going to tell you and Elaine.
(Laughs nervously) ..Ulterior motive.
Oh, no, no, no...you sit right here...I will get you a nice snack.
Fire! Get out of the way!
No no no, you know actually we are friends of a serial killer.
I thought you meant the..
I didn't even know Fulton was in the hospital.
Really?
(To Jerry) We got work to do. What about the meeting?
No, say. I want you to say.
(While skimming a Monk's menu) You know, I didn't go to the bathroom the entire time we were in India.
So we started drinking, and I'll tell you I don't know if it was the alcohol or the ammonia, but the next think I knew she was mopping the floor with me.
He can be pedantic. He can be pedantic.
That's a shame. (Karen is shown singing off-key on the television.)
Why not?
I change I change. Two weeks ago I tried a soft boiled egg. Never liked it before. Now I'm dunkin a piece of toast in there and I'm loving it.
Well, she didn't BUY the big salad. I bought the big salad.
I still don't understand this. Abby has a mentor?
It wasn't funny.
How come youre not doin the second show tomorrow?
Well we were all eating the raisins. And I remember you--you were eating some of the raisins. And then you left, and the raisins were gone. And I was just wondering if, you know (chuckles), maybe you took them with you.
I believe you cut me off, and then made an obscene gesture.
What?!
(little worried) Coffee? (thinks) I can beat that. Move in with me.
I'll make time, because Abby, I was once like you; wide-eyed, naive, I didn't know the first thing about a subject as fundamental as risk management.
I'm interested.
It was a good jig.
(gets up to leave the table) HELLO!!! (angrily)
Did you see that? That-that pigeon didn't move! I had to swerve to get out of the way! I saved that pigeons life!
It's nothing, stop it..
So he walks out of the stall, he's been talking the whole time.
(disbelief) What? (laugh) Wh... what're you talking about? I'm not the one with the problem. (defensive) Lloyd Braun was in the nuthouse, not me.
Aw, Kramer, don't start...
Those are my friends I was telling you about. We're gonna talk to them, pull over.
First time in my life I've ever gotten back at someone.
(Ironing) You don't wanna know.
And she slaves to earn every penny. So that someday, I might be able to walk up to a woman and say, "Yes, I'm bald, but I'm still a good person."
(Walks off) I got a lot of thinking to do.
Right.. the sign. (Hesitates, then makes a series of stupid gestures)
I think I'd be good at that. I talk to people all the time. Someone even told me once they thought I'd be a good talk show host.
Oh, those, those aren't my keys.
Ow. My eye, my eye.
I don't know. He can be so weird sometimes.
Maybe she just wants to talk to me?
What are you talking about?
Almost there.
Sure, sure, sure, sure. (patting Jerry on the shoulders) How about these seats? Are these fantastic, huh? Huh? I feel like Lincoln.
I can't come out. They're standing right by the door. Throw it up!
(getting up out of his chair to get out of the Mohel's way) No, No.
How did you get all this?
When you're talking about a movie like "Beaches", moving from the chair to the couch , . . . that's quite a voyage.
The attic? Y-you haven't wore any of those clothes for years.
They way he just says stuff.
It's an expression.
For that rent, shed take a bath in the toilet tank if she had to.
Guess, what I got.
Milano.
Good Morning!
Hey. There is a couple of people that wouldn't mind having me out of the way.
You got bit by a strange dog and you didn't get a rabies shot?
What are you kidding? We look great! You know what this pudding needs? The skin on the top, you know like your mother used to make it on the stove.
What does this mean?
(can't be heard but looks like) Kramer!
Well, you know, I've been lyin' about my income for a few years. I figured I could afford a fake house in the Hamptons.
You're uh, physical therapist, right?
Do you uh feel the way you feel after the Risotto?
You went home with him?
Whad you do that for?
What?
Alright, fine.I'll drive the 3 hours each way, 6 hours all together, and take 'em off myself!!
Oh, come on, you're good at this.
Oh yes, Mr.Wilhelm, yeah...
That's it?
I've coupled! I've coupled!
(depressed) Feel like I can't do anything wrong.
Now she thinks we're gay, not that there's anything wrong with it...
Dad, you know what it takes to compete with Microsoft and IBM?
``Ponce de Leon''? But that was great!
She dragged me down to that warehouse on the waterfront in Brooklin to see one of her "performances".
No, I was just wondering... if you guys, uh, had any gum.
Festivus, Sir. And, uh, I was afraid that I would be persecuted for my beliefs. They drove my family out of Bayside, Sir!
Oh... make it stop.
Yeah, is he still mad at you for crashing his Thanksgiving party?
Allison! Hi! Oh, my God! How are you?
Nah.
Jerry, unless I pull down on this statuette and a hidden wall opens up, we have checked every square inch of this apartment!
Rest stop supply.
Hello.
Seven!!
I think they really went for that Soda.
we rode along all the way to the hospital
Ponce de Leon? Okay. (to Jerry) You sure you don't wanna go?
I already bought it! I've been lyin' to you for three days, and now you're all screwin' me!
Jerry, a throat-clear is a non-verbal implication of doubt - he thinks I killed Susan!
No, you just tell him ah, an old boyfriend has come back into your life.
I was trying to stick the landing. (indistinct) ...was right around here.
I wasn't going to say anything, but then I could see that he wasn't going to open his mouth. (Chuckles)
(Losing it) I guess everyone here enjoys giving the old screwgie, huh?! Youre all doin a hell of a job! (Looks longingly at the Twix in the machine) Ho, ho. What I would do with you..
All right, I made up the part about the car, but the rest is true. And he hated me anyway!
Yep. I'm leaving first thing tomorrow morning.
I can't believe I missed Kramer. You know he asked me to go with him to California.
"The phone's a piece of junk, goodbye"!
So, what's happening with the TV show? You come up with anything?
(still worried) He was pretty emphatic?
Kramer, I cant believe it. Oh, youre my hero!
And why shouldn't you? Be fresh Stay fresh
No, that's not enough BTUs for my living room...That was a complete waste of time.
Apply for a job? What for?
Jerry? I have to tell you something. This is the dullest moment Ive ever experienced.
Shouldn't we at least drop off your bag?
Oh, no, no...condoms are for single men. The day that we got engaged, I said goodbye to the condom forever.
I had no Idea you were filled with such....sexuality..
Hey, I know what I'm talking about. I gotta be honest with you, I gotta tell ya... Ever since I saw you holding hands with that woman, I can't get you out of my mind.
Oh, can you be any more dramatic?
(Muttering out, not really wanting to talk about his family) When the Costanzas came here, one brother stayed behind.
What's so hard about that? How am I supposed to get it in there? I can't just walk in with it. I have to get the Rosses out of the apartment!
Jerry, . . .
No. He was fine with it. Check that out.
Mr Wilhelm, what was that?!
You remember my cousin Rhisa? I'm gonna date her.
I said, do you like ice?
But Jerry, this is not coming out!
By the way, you owe me seven fifty.
You see.....WHAT!!
Alright?
I've never seen a big salad.
And if I don't call...
No difference. I could care less. She's Jerry's girlfriend.
(Laughs as they leave) It's working already! (Both exit)
Yeah well, we don't think.
What are you, Bud Abbott? What are you callin me an idiot?
No! No!!
See now that bothers me even more than dying bothers me, cause it's people like you who live to be a hundred and twenty because you're not bothered by it. How could it not bother you?
Yeah.
Because I... I love you.
(singing) Lemon tree, very pretty and a lemon flower...
So you're on the speed dial?
Hold on. Hold on. Wait a minute. How am I gonna get the rye bread into the apartment?
Oh, my God...
No, I don't have any change. I never carry change.
Yeah, yeah, not fan talk, not gushing, you know? Actual conversation, I was incredibly articulate!
Im going to find out whats going on. All right?
No?
Besides, Steven Koren has the highest of aspirations. He wants to be (pauses for effect) an architect.
Well, I've given this a lot of thought, and I've gotta say...
You don't know what that spot means to him. Once he gets it, he doesn't go out for weeks.
Allison bought it for me.
So, you wanna go home and...make up, officially?
The Jon Voight car is no more.
Oh, I'm goin' baby. I'm goin.' (Heads for the door, then stops.) It's Jerry's fault. He took out all my good lines. He's such a control freak!
Well, yeah.
...and, and maybe shell see me when she gets there, does this woman intend to spend time with me?
One-one-thousand, two-one-thousand, three-one-thousand.
De-compressing.
Jerry, would you do me a favor, close the window.
Yeah, that's exactly what I'm worried about. God would never let me be successful. He'd kill me first. He'd never let me be happy.
The place went nuts.
(getting irritated) He's an importer-exporter. Okay?
(puzzled) W-we're not?
Can't you think of something. Call in a bomb threat.
No.
Well at least you and I are talking about how there's nothing to talk about.
Well hello. Um, ah, specifically the reason that I'm here, uh, I don't know uh what Elaine told you but uh I broke up with my girlfriend a couple of weeks ago. Actually she broke up with me [struggling with his coat zipper] and uh, well, I was the cause of it and uh, I just wanted to find out from you ... What's with this thing?
and JERRY Yeah.
Well, it happened again.
Ok uh, I guess I'll tell them that.
Something happened to the food?
Big hefty stinking faux pas.
(Interrupts) And I still say hes naked under there!
Is that tolerable?
Well, at least we know the prosthetic squirrel hips work ... sorry bout the set.
Payroll? No, no, I haven't done that.
No, Kramer. I have to have this statue.
(shocked) What?
I'm engaged to Mr. Ross' niece. I'm probably gonna be taking over this whole place someday so if I were you I would stay on my good side.
Wink.
Now, you see, I don't get that. We had a relaxed stimulating, great conversation, she doesn't mention it? Why doesn't she mention it?
It's a foreign movie... a *film*, is what it is, actually.
No, no, he mimed it. That's what was so funny about it.
Where does he come off?
Plans. Schemes. She ah, she keeps talking about getting back together with her old friends, you know - "the gang," as she likes to call them (chuckles), you know. Yeah, they're eh, they're hatching something, you can count on that.
Well, I was exaggerating a bit, just for effect.
Ya!
(smiles) Beats the hell out of coffee.
(To Estelle) Scissor. (She gets the scissors from the coffee table and hands them to George with the point facing him) Don't hand them to me with the point facing out!
All right, he's letting you in. Thank you! Creep.
Yes, I am.
Yes, I like to just be able to take the blankets and swish them and swirl them, you know what I mean? You know, I don't like being all tucked in. I like to have a lot of room, you know I like to have my toes pointed up in the air. Just like to scrunch up the blankets.
I'm not crying. And I shouldn't have said that about your wife. Please accept my apologies.
Hey, 'The White Shadow' is on...
Unless she goes for the bathroom. Thats my only chance. (George crumbles. He drops the cassette on the table.) Who am I kidding? I cant do this, I cant do this. I dont even know how to work those stupid machines.
I'm, uh, George Costanza. I was having dinner with your son.
(Breathing deeply) That's very dirty. (Jerry nods) That's absolutely filthy.
Anyway there was all this tension. I asked her if she wanted to go out to dinner and she said "no, maybe we could get together for lunch." You know what that means.
Everybody's talkin' at me...I can't hear a word they're sayin'...just drivin' around in Jon Voight's car...
Fine. Excellent. Could you do me a favor? Could you not tuck the blankets in? 'Cause I can't sleep all tucked in.
Um, you know Im starting to think that maybe lobster isnt the way to go.
Go back?
Why don't you see someone about it?
No, that's my only suit. It cost me 350 dollars. I got it at Moe Ginsburg.
Me neither!
They wish. I hate the big broker-houses. Hate them with a passion. Big broker-houses killed my father.
So we had a good time... the four of us.
Uh, railroads, uh...
Ssssso, after me, you... went that way?
It's like, all dented.
He's an obscure writer. Betnik, on the village.
(on phone, as Jerry gestures beside him) No, Lindsay, it was not IN the garbage. It was above the garbage. Hovering. Like an angel. Of course I know your aunt bit it. I kissed her goodbye. Listen, can I tell you something else? In my family, we used to eat out of the garbage all the time. (Jerry makes a face) It was no big thing. That's right. Oh, okay. Buh-bye. (hangs up phone) I'm back in, she gave me a second chance.
Big fan! Big fan.
You are my friend.
In every situation. No matter how silly I look. (Tastes his Clams Casino) Hm.. tastes a little funky.
Make myself comfortable. What does that mean? Does she want me to take my clothes off? Is she taking her clothes off? What if I take my clothes off and she still has hers' on? Then I really look like an idiot. She could get offended and leave. So maybe I should leave them on, but what then if she takes her off? Then she'll feel humiliated. 'Make yourself comfortable'. I got this unbelievable woman and this 'comfortable'-thing can ruin me. I got it! I take my shoes off and sit on the bed. There, that's comfortable. She can't accuse me being unconvertible.
Someday, before I die, mark my words - I'm gonna tell that woman exactly what I think of her. I'll never be able to forgive myself until I do.
You're *selling* the car!?
Mind? Why would I mind? I would love to wait! (shakes hands with Nana) Nana, nice to see you. Ni-ni-ni-ni-NANA! (embraces another guest, kisses her) Aunt Phyllis, always a pleasure. What a pleasure! Hey, let's do this again real soon. I had fun, huh?
Oh, I was gonna pay for this.
Oh yeah HA-A-A, HA-A-A.
(angry) She won't sweeten, and I'm bitter!
Oh, well, a mantel's a whole different story.
Where did you get those?
Y'know what it is? It's "Clara Nightingale Syndrome." He falls ill; she falls in love.
What kind of a sick impulse does that??
I can't. He's been on my case about not paying attention. Besides, it's too late, I already told him I heard him.
Well I just stomped some pigeons in the park. They - they didn't move.
(Stern) No, ma, I'm not gonna see a psychiatrist. N- I don't care if you do pay for it! No! Discussion over. Yeah, alright, I'll see you later. Yes, of course I'm gonna come by. Alright. (Hangs up, slamming it down on the coffee table. He sits down next to Jerry) My mother wants me to see a psychiatrist now. Why?! Because she caught me? (Scoffs, shaking his head) You know, if everyone who did that had to go see a psychiatrist.. (Laughing, he snorts)
Check, please.
I don't think we should see each other any more.
His personal file, I, I don't ask...
All right, Kramer that's it.....( pushes the camera) Hello . English. Does anyone speak English
Oh, nothing much. You know, I went over to Jerry's. Talked to Jerry. Um, could I talk to you for a minute?
Isn't it?
try shaking it...(long pause) Well,Janet should be here any minute.
Well, what was I supposed to do? Get out of the shower, put on my bathrobe? Go all the way down to the other end? Come all the way back?
Oh, hi.. (They shake hands)
So?
She says she has to come to New York on business...
Hey, I am not a prude sweetheart. I swing with the best of them. (snapping his fingers 5 times)
(nods to Kramer) Tell him, Kramer.
Good night, Stan.
No, something's off here, you hesitated.
So, you need me to get fired.
No..hummm, What do you know about what you look like.
Just enjoying watching you.
"Right!"
Yeah, I told her how toilet paper hasn't changed in my lifetime, and probably wouldn't change in the next fifty thousand years and she was fascinated, fascinated!
'The lights are much brighter there. You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares, just go...'
What is that?
(pleased) You've made Jerry very happy.
Why don't you call her agency. Maybe she's been out of town and she didn't get the calls.
(Smiling to himself) You don't have to worry about me. (Nodding, gloating) I won a contest.
Flowing?
What was that all about?
What, you don't want to be you?
(to Jerry) What do you mean by that?
I wonder if, ah, Susan ... (picks up the phone from the coffee table, then decides not to call) No. I better just go. (claps hands) heh. All right! See ya. (grabs his rain coat from the hook by the door and rushes out)
Danielle. Where's Neil? (indicating the bed) Is this him?
Well, thats flattering.
When I was working I spent baby.
Well, it's this little place with this little bathroom. It's like right there, you know, it's not even down a little hall or off in an alcove. You understand? There's no... buffer zone. So, we start to fool around, and it's the first time, and it's early in the going. And I begin to perceive this impending... intestinal requirement, whose needs are going to surpass by great lengths anything in the sexual realm. So I know I'm gonna have to stop. And as this is happening I'm thinking, even if I can somehow manage to momentarily... extricate myself from the proceedings and relieve this unstoppable force, I know that that bathroom is not gonna provide me with the privacy that I know I'm going to need...
Morning, ma.
Jerry! Hey, that's the guy!
yeah....euh...I dunno What?
I don't know.
Gee, I'm sorry... I got here first.
There was something so reassuring about that cozy little space.
Like you do.
No, Newman, stop it.
Like us. (Elaine enters)
Wh..what're you doing here?
What's for supper?
Yes, I mentioned your name.
Don't you see what this is?
I know but I couldn't think of anything else to say to her.
(together -- with arms extended -- palms upwards) Stan The Caddy.
No, no, what, what?
Now, listen closely. I was at the unemployment office and I told them that I was very close to getting a job with Vandelay Industries and I gave them your phone number. So, when now when the phone rings you've got to answer "Vandelay Industries".
Well, what are you gonna do?
Look at where we are! (referring to the seat usher) He's not stopping! He just keeps going and going and going! (the usher abruptly stops at the second row) We're not in the first row?
I said so many things.
Oh. Sorry.
You have my spare-key in your apartment, right?
Great.
That's why the world's in the shape it's in.
Wish I could. (raises the magazine up in front of his face and continues reading.)
Yeah. Eric the Clown put it out with his big shoe.
No, I don't know who was doing that.
I'm following him.
Yeah, she's a sweet ride.
(scoffs) Those unions. (sighs) Okay. Sports,...movies. What about a talk show host?
Did she do it on purpose?
Kramer, they like everybody. Theyre friendly people.
'My wife's in a coma.' Yeah? Well, the life support machine called and...
No. I didn't get it.
I'm going shopping with Susan.
Hey. You know, do I have a case for you guys to do on L.A. Law.
My story?
I'm not going to see that nut doctor she went to Europe with.
The point is I was here first.
(walking back) Are you sure? 'Cause it could really help me out of a jam.
Are you often on business trip? Nice...oh, hey nice ice-bucket.
Alright, I just have to go over to the Ross' apartment and drop off Susan's sunglasses. You'll come with me?
Well, there's going to be a lot of dentists there.
Who is this? (sees photo)
We all got along. Everyone seemed very pleasant.
Whatever.
Yeah.
Right, ready?
I'm not her boyfriend. I want to be her boyfriend.
Right. So I call her up, I tell her its me, she gives me an enthusiastic Hi!
I think that's Mr. Hayman. ...The gym teacher from our High School.
Just need to uh, to dig 'em up.
Yeah. Yeah, he's quite a character.
You said the guy gave you an open-lipped kiss!
Stinks.
Tell her about the shoving.
Yes. She's got great skin - a rosy glow..
Hey Elaine? Put me down for some of that art. 1,900 dollars worth.
(Defensively) Whatever.
Ah. You see, the man who was the butler, uh, had gotten into a car accident with Jerry, and because he didn't have any insurance, the judge decreed that the man become Jerry's butler.
(to Susan's stone) ...And then, right after the All-Star Break, we, we just swept the Orioles. Four games. In Baltimore. (adjusts necktie nervously) So... yeah.
You better call her.
You don't want to suffer with this all weekend.
Yes.
Wait a second. Think about it. He's not showing up. Wait till you see the line of cabs, its like forty-five minutes long. You said he's in Chicago.
He said that? (Daphne shacks her head) What a nerve. How dare he say something like that.
Are you sure?
Now, this is the basic layout for Mario's Pizza.
25 kids for his birthday party? (to kid under table) Don't put your tongue on the floor! He's putting his tongue on the floor! Here, here, have some more sugar packets. (tosses some Equal packets under the table)
Is "yada yada" bad?
Oh, this is my friend Jerry.
Ah, excuse me. Do you have, uh, change of a dollar?
I have nothing to say to anybody. I'm so uninteresting. I think I'm out of conversation.
She told you she doesn't like me!
(standing) Not yet, but she's weakening.
Alright. I'll run it by a few people.
Well, I know when I'm a little strapped, I sometimes drop off my rent check having forgotten to sign it. That could buy us some time.
Don't go. Kramer! Come back. I got great news. Well, I did it.
(over the speaker) It's George.
Oh, this is huge!
No, anything.
Why not?
Alright, that's it. Alright, good, eight thousand dollars. (to Cynthia) Cynthia, again, nice meeting you. Have I commented on the shoes? I love suede, it's so thick and rich. Did you ever, you ever rub it against the grain? Alright, anyway...
I don't think so I know so, Kramer, come here I got to talk to you
No?
Kramer.
Jerry drinks Morning Thunder?
Hey
Let Maria Shriver give her a baby shower.
Yeah, like he was really gonna take your money.
What happened?
Ah, see, Mister.. I didn't write that report. That, that's not mine.
Alright, now, how are we gonna monitor this thing?
oh, . . .because she handed you the bag. I could have handed you the bag. She happened to pick it up at the restaurant even though, . . .
Awright, listen, can you uh, gimme a lift back to my place?
It was.
I got it. Cups in the front, loops in the back. (puts the bra on the table)
Oh, it's a bad day. Uh, you got everyone in your house, you're thinkin', "These are my friends?!"
Hot? (Feels Tartabull's material.) What is this?
Over here.
(NOT INTERESTED) Really.
You've been demoted.
I know.
(upset) Well, you've scared her off. We may never see mom again.
Yeah, drove away.. You know, I said 'Hello' to him. You know, he's - he's-
Hey. (pointing at him) Corbin Bernsen.
I told you, he probably went out the back.
Me too.
Jerry, it's fantastic. I love the people over there. They- they treat me so great. You know they think I'm handicapped, they gave me this incredible office, a great view.
You came to see me. I work in the building.
Every time we go out to eat the minute we we're done eating she's runnin to the bathroom.
Of Course I'm telling the truth.
(smiling expectantly) Here it comes.
Exactly..
No, I-I-I-I'm good. Really.
It was an inferno in there! An inferno! (Eric, Robin's mother, and all the kids rush at George.)
I am an art-adorer! I adore art.
(desperate) Please! I have so little!
(dials) Hi, are you OK? no, no,.. huh, (hangs up) She hung up.
Who's that?
How can I take it?
(PROUDLY) Me too.
Susan, wait please... (grabs her) Please ...
What's it say?
Well, it's definetly him.
It's George
(to Jerry) Yeah, your milk.
Hey.
All bald people look good in hats.
Tightness..
I don't know. This sandwich is making me flush.
(to Elaine) What are you doin' here?
Yeah, yeah I really had some guts back then. Why don't we do it again?
No.
Ohh, I have tremendous respect for people who work with feet. I mean, to dedicate yourself to the foot - you're toiling in virtual anonymity. I mean..
It's like a magic trick. Sometimes I think it would be easier to bend a spoon mentally than to make that transformation.
How could you do that?!
(to Jerry) Dont you find that strange?
We were expecting about two hundred people...Well...Thank you , thank you.
(pondering) Yes I suppose they do.
Hi Connie, Jerry around?
JODI! (he starts running after her)
How was the show?
(laughs - hehe) Well, first, I'm brushing my teeth and this piece of apple-skin, that must have been lodged in there for days, comes loose.
So they're flying the tiny instruments in from El Paso.
Wait, wait, did you ever see him throw up?!
Prognosis Negative! (again in a funny voice)
Jerry, what do you, you wanna, you wanna see the place or not?
Just like that.
So we order lunch, and were talking. Finally, she blurts out how its not working.
Excuse me, do you have a ticket?
No. (dips the chip) You dip the way you want to dip...(bites the chip) I'll dip the way I want to dip. (dips the chip again.)
Right
Hello.
You know, if it was a regular salad I wouldn't have said anything. But you had to have the BIG SALAD.
So she doesn't like me?
No!
I used to share that same outlook. But now, I have so many things to occupy my mind. For instance, the atom.
That's what nuns and Red Cross workers are for.
(annoyed) Good for the tuna.
Of course. But I really wanna leave my mark this time, you know, uh. I wanna walk away from the Yankees with people saying 'Wow! Now that guy got canned!'
Jerry, I'm trapped under my desk. Steinbrenner is in the room. You got to help[ me.
Besides, what's it gonna cost me? Thirty-eight bucks?
Hum..( to Elaine) Hey! did you talk to Paula?
Oh, I got it.
You know, the time..
Bone marrow.
Alright, lets get in there. Quick, quick, quick...
I, uh, just think it's a little unusual. Two people to sit on one side...and leave the other side empty.
Yeah, hell have my parents.
Oh, come on.
Well, cause we were just saying we were going to ask you to come up to the country with us this weekend. Susan's father has a cabin up there. But, eh, all right, well.
What do you think?
It's open!
(doing the voice) Im slippery as an eel
What happens if the husband dies after the wife, who brings in the clothing in then?
(continuing) I feel like a family. In fact, yesterday was Grace's birthday. She's such a sweet woman so, we had a little party, with cake and champagne. I made a toast.
Hey, it's Georgie.
Teasing.
Did you see what just happened?
They were in here, I saw her put 'em in here!
(thoughtful) Yes. Yes.
MOOPS, MOOPS
You're Batman.
He just read it. (Russell vomits again. Jerry and George look ashamed.)
I don't believe it.
Who, the Croat? [the tennis player]
Ow! Hot! Hot!
Now Im in the worst position of all.
It's a pot pourri. May I, uh, may I show you the master bedroom? (they leave together)
Great! I ate the entire platter! Had to call in sick today.
...Huh!
Of course.
Me either.
(to Jody) You're listening to this?
So, maybe this should be it.
I walked.
Yeah, I hope so. For your sake!
Well, some women like it.
I don't think we should. We really don't know each other very well.
. We should be having dinner with our sons when we're sixty.
(incredulity) Him you brainwashed! (angry shout) What's he got that I don't have?!
Now, if this mechanic guy, was, in fact, eating a 5th Avenue bar, as he claims, wouldnt you agree he would have no problem picking one out from a candy line-up?
But tell him to give me the--
No, you're crushing my sandwich.
Well, I can't walk anywhere now. I'm just gonna be wishing there were walkways. (seeing Elaine removing her shoe) What are you doing?
I don't know.
(sensing his chance) Well, they do now. Neighborhood's changing.
Hello.
Excuse me, darling, do I detect a Portuguese accent?
Look, I'm doing you a favor. They're having an unadvertised sale. This suit is gonna be half-priced starting ... Monday.
Yeah.
Yeah. But it was somebody's arm.
You can do better than me. You could throw a dart out the window and hit someone better than me. I'm no good!
I would like to dip my bald head in oil and rub it all over your body. [No reaction] You don't understand! It's a miracle! You don't understand because you don't speak English!
Susan's college roommate.
It's my name. I made it up. You can't just steal it.
(Gestures for Kramer to shut up) Once again, Antonio, I can't even begin to say how deeply, deeply sorry I am about everything. The job, the cat.. (A lamp breaks) the lamp.
You knew? How did you know?
Except for one small problem. Hah, I left some books in her apartment.
It was a good idea. Susan liked it. Now, if he hadn't vomitted all over her, we'd be writing it right now.
(head down low) I...I wouldn't know"
He fired me.
Okay, go ahead.
Let me ask you something. What do you do for a living, Newman?
Hey, what's your guy's name again?
This is very exciting. The inner sanctum.
That's an interesting question.
So uh where we eating?
(agitated) He's lying, sir! I'm tired of all your macho head games!
Well, if he can regift, why can't you degift?
Hey!
I mean, you've seen her, right?
I do for the bad things.
Where'd you go?
A cup of coffee. That, that doesn't mean anything.
Hey.
Thats so brutal, I hate that.
(Getting up) Alright, Ma, that's enough!
Ya-see, how could this not have any fat? It's too good.
Really?
So, uh are you sleeping with Peterman?
Yeah.( reaches for the purse and finds a piece of paper . he looks annoyed.
So? Where are we going?
I had nothing to do wtih any of this! I met all her friends, I didnt want to meet them. I kept trying to avoid it. I knew it would only get me in deeper. But they were everywhere! They kept popping up all over the place. This is Nancy, this is Susan, this is Amy, this is my cousin, this is my brother, this is my father... Its like Im in quicksand.
Hey, it's George. Listen, I-
Hey, maybe I could bribe one of those women that hand out the towels in the powder room.
You know my last name is Costanza. That's Italian. So you and I are like country men. Pisano's!
Pull it up a little bit.
Or we don't even send the check and then when they call, we pretend we're the cleaning service. Heh heh. "Hello? I sorry, no here Kruger."
Is it?
$3.49? It says $1.49.
I see what you mean.
Is that right? I just threw away a lifetime of guilt-free sex, and floor seats for ever sporting event in Madison Square Garden. So please, a little respect. For I am Costanza Lord of the Idiots!
Walked around? And you looked?
Well, I am not going.
(Vowing) Well, I'll tell you this, though - I am never doing.. that , again.
Well, You're not gonna believe it...
Shall we say an hour.
No, what?
Yes, it is consistent. I've, uh, I've tried to maintain a consistent feel throughout the house.
(Elaine walking down the hall they notice her and wave her into the room) Elaine! Get! (She enters)
Alright, this is what ya gotta do I need ya to go out to the parking lot at Yankee Stadium, take the flyers off my car.
Yeah, what the hell?!
Oh, they're busting!
All right, all right, calm down, calm down. Whatever happened in the past is past.
Oh, oh!
You can go crazy trying to figure that place out.
So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified! But I pressed on -- and as I made my way passed the breakers a strange calm came over me. I-I don't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment  I was a Marine Biologist!
Latvia?
Oh, Noooo, I'm so sorry. It's the MOOPS. The correct answer is, The MOOPS.
No, we're not. We're not men.
I've been doing a lot of thinking. This might be my chance to start giving something back.
I'm George. George Costanza, you live around here?
I..I..I dunno.
Water coolers?
(he thinks) I think the hats. The hat conveys that solemn religious look you want in a faith. Very pious.
Yeah. I love Hampton tomatoes. You know, you can eat 'em like apples. You know it's funny, the tomato never really took on as a hand fruit.
Guess what.
Oh my God. I just remembered where I left my retainer in second grade. I'll see ya. (He throws finished Rubik's cube to Jerry and he exits. Kramer enters)
You know what, bad mistake my mistake do me a favor go back to the other lane - you'll never get there - forget this lane - y'a kn ow what this lane stinks - go back to the other lane - bad decision - go go go take this light - take this light -
I see.
Hey, is it my imagination, or do really good looking women walk a lot faster than everybody else?
Tell me about the free facial.
Aahh..No..No..
Oh, I wanted to talk to you--I'm sorry, I--didn't know you... (re Donna) had company. (Jerry indicates he should stay) Hiya, I'm George.
Yes. Please. Please, let's go.
Take a wild guess.
'Scarsdale surprise'. That's the musical about that Scarsdale diet doctor murder.
My regular face.
(inside bathroom) Nah.
(amused) You're supposed to do that?
Dad?!
Jerry, my vacation just started. I need a day or two to de-compress. Besides, I did plenty today.
"There's a lot of money in this.. He's got a proven sales method"
Wait a minute Jerry, there's a bigger issue here. If you go through that wall and become one of those guys I'll be left here on this side. Take me with you.
. . . I thought the woman was kind of cute.
Of course it's cashmere.
I understand you offer a 50%-off 'bereavement' fare...?
So, he made an appointment for me to see Dinkins' doctor. He's just trying to humiliate me.
Hey, Kramer, what are you doing Tuesday?
No, don't say a word. If she thinks my friends are jerks, then I'm a *jerk*...
(picking up his coat) Awright, I'm heading home.
Oh, nothing.
Jerry.
Well I just got the estimate. It's going to cost more to fix that roof than the car's worth, So I'm going over to see that hospital administrator today. Someone is gonna pay for this damage and it's not gonna be me.
Howbout sports? Do you follow sports?
I'll tell you what that is - that's a violation of club rules. Now I got him! And you're my witness!
Oh, my God.
(indicating the window) Kramer, it's, it's raining. They got the tarp on the field.
Nothing.
(muttering to himself) I wonder why.
It's an early Christmas present.
All right, great.
I gotta get to Fowler. I know that he would take this squirrel off my hands. It's practically bionic!
How much tip do you leave on $8.15?
Ehh. (nostalgic) Remember that summer at Dairy Queen where I cooled my feet in the soft-serve machine?
Oh, this is all locking in now. It is all locking in! (laughing)
Well, what should I do, Kramer?
Aww.
(Needing to get away from his parents, he gets up) I need some air..
And you're the shark?
He's ripping you off
What is this thing doing here?
Yeah, it's being framed right now. I don't even know what it costs. (beat) Not, uh, too expensive, is it?
I'm choking!
So concerned was he, that word of his poor tennis skills might leak out, he chose to offer you his wife as some sort of mediaeval sexual payola?
I'm not going if he's going.
What was that line again? Something about finding your way in a shadow?
All right... here goes...
You paying my hotel and airfare to Miami?
The only thing that bothers me is that I'm just coming up with this now.
I don't know what Newman wanted to see me for.
No, can't say as I did.
He massacred you.
Yeah, right. I'll just go up and say, "Hi, how ya' doing? Would you like a glass of white wine?" JERRY Before you got within twenty feet of this woman, she'd have her finger on the mace button. She's like an expensive car with one of those motion-sensor force field alarms. Any sudden movement in the area could set her off.
I eh, I had a sandwich in my pocket.
Why not?
Frolf, frisbee golf Jerry. Golf with a frisbee. This is gonna be my time. Time to taste the fruits and let the juices drip down my chin. I proclaim this The Summer of George!
Plenty of mosquitoes.
I'm excited about the pouty.
(Showing an example) What'd you do today?
An ostrich burger.
All right. All right.
More wine and turkey? (Pours Celia more wine)
Yeah, what is he? Some sort of an instigator?
But my friend here has hypothermia.
Boy, my knuckles are still cramped from that football game.
You're doing all the leg work.
What do you mean?
I was just in there. Its embarrassing.
What if he left you a used Kleenex, what's that, a valentine? Now you go up to him and you tell him that if he's thinking of turning me in, that I got the goods on him!
Hey, hey, hey! I dig.
That's true, that always happens to me.
Im outta the picture. I am outta the picture. (laughs) Its only a matter of time now.
And you don't have to pay.
Um, excuse me, I - I think you forgot my bread.
So the plan is to secretly sterilise her mouth?
...but is there any way that I could possibly have Neil's phone number?
What do you know? You were in the nut house.
April.
Haha (laughs)
No, not at all...
Ooh yeah, the bags, sure.
Yeah, dentist of the stars.
This week. My father got a deal from a friend of his. It's Gore-Tex. You know about Gore-Tex?
Well, I think Poppie's got some problems. There's a whole other thing going on with Poppie. So how did you leave it?
(ecstatic) What? You're moving to Florida!?! That's wonderful! I'm so happy! (pause) For you! I'm so happy for you! Oh, what do you need this cold weather for?
What'd he tell you?
Yeah, they're not better than me.
The guy slept with Marilyn Monroe, he's in Dinky Donuts. What about this doctor's note? Let's go see your friend Roy.
Reparations!
Oh great.
They? The Government?
Your lawyer wears a cape...?
(Smiling) You got it, Ma. (She smiles back, nodding) A little later. (George sits back in a nearby chair, looking at the divider in anticipation)
Oh, every chance I get.
Huh. Excuse me (to Ping) Hum... Do you speak chinese?
Black and white?
Yeah! Yeah.
You didn't get one?
There was nothing else on. Oh, the left arm.. the left arm.
Those birthdays. I told you. They're relationship killers. If a relationship is having any problems whatsoever, a birthday will always bring it out.
Hey, how ya doing?!?
Can't we just fix the old one?
So countries just exchange gifts like that?
Twenty years? That long?
I noticed you eh, chose the eh "clowns with balloons" check design.
Wait a minute, wait a minute, do you think I?m comfortable here. I can't change, I?ve got no clothes here! You've got to go like that, I can?t go like this alone!
And I always take care of my Pisano's. So here is a little something. (drop in tip and worker looks the other way, so George decides to take it out and try again only to get caught)
Yes it is.
Was she uh, was she a big, uh woman?
Did you happen to notice that Julie handed the big salad to Elaine?
Excuse me, where are we?
What? I work here.
What? Is that bad?
Well, it's just, all you said was 'your welcome', which is nice. It's very nice. But... I feel I gotta get the apology.
Defective?!
(incredulous) I look just like him. I. Me. (flings his arms out) This! This is what her boyfriend looks like. How is that possible?
We'll come up with something.
Catch what in time?
He's got a gun! He's got a gun! Get out of the way! (Tries to flee the bar in a mad panic. The audience in the club also goes nuts and heads for the exits. Jerry stands onstage, perplexed.)
Mr.Wilhelm...
Hey, there's a tomato stand, let's stop, I can get some more.
Gonna see her again?
Don't need it. N'huhuhu (laughs)
Well, maybe it was Ghostbusters? Where ever it was, it worked!
Hnh. That's nerve...
This is my ketchup. I bought this ketchup just so I could have as much as I want.
What-what are you doing?
No, I uh... I use it.
Why can't we share?
What, you are comparing me to Biff Loman, very encouraging. The biggest loser in history of American literature.
And now?
...Huh?
O.k....(is about to explain. Cut to Jerry on-stage.)
I cant believe I won at Inka-dink.
Of course not. I mean sure, there may have been one or two occasions in the past, when I may have reacted in uh impulsive or somewhat immature manner, but those days are well behind me.
How' you doing?
. . . . . . Yeah.
Nah, I gotta deliver some Christmas presents to my parents.
You saw who, what?
(While pointing at Jerry) Not me! Him! His fault! He betrayed me!
Tuesday? I can't do it Tuesday. Steinbrenner needs me to run---
If you're in some situation where some fast cash will save your life, I'll give you the code.
(bored to death) Well, I-I just recently uh...
I like to stop at the duty free shop!
It's like some pod landed from another planet and took your body. Don't fall asleep Elaine.
I don't know. She..She's having some problems with this guy she's seeing.
You really think so?
I been, uh, thinking about the family. Tell me, uh, about Aunt Baby.
Is that the lovely Mrs. Morgan?
So, she fell, and then she started screaming, "My back! My back!" So, I picked her up and took her to the hospital.
You think she thinks I have a beautiful face, or is she just saying that?
Oh.
Haaaaaa!!!
Now, each of you is here because you're the best at what you do.
Oh that's eh, that's a sandwich.
Huh, really? How bad? Was he on his death bed?
Well, she probably just assumed.
(melancholy) I wish that was all needed. Life can be so confusing. I..I'm searching for answers, anywhere.
(energetically) "Well seems it's about time for George's lunch."
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. All right. I don't think we're gonna have any problem with that. (chuckles nervously) Good talking to you Tom. Really.
Can I go like this?
All right. I don't.
Ye - yeah. And we had a pact, you know.
Yo, dad. This is my boss, Mr. Kruger.
I was seven and a half.
You know, you have to know how to do that. You cant have people shoving their arms into a six-hundred degree oven!
I dont know why you even bother with this ping pong guy, Ill tell you that.
?? get away??
He..he wants to talk to me?
Well I don't want to get into a big dispute about the pants.
A biopsy?
It's really not accurate. Nobody drinks from a water cooler any more - they use bottles.
I really can not comprehend how stupid people could be sometimes. Can you comprehend it?
Very good. Go on.
Get out of here.
I can't tell ya how much I appreciate this.
(Offering) Drink?
I am. The folks are twelve hundred miles away. (gleeful) I'm basking in the buffer zone. (looks for the waitress) 'Nother piece of pie here!
(outside, looking the guy trying the suit through the window, and thinking out loud) What's this? Can't I leave this place for a second? (goes in, take off his jacket, walks to the guy and talks to him with an european accent) Can I help you?
Oh no no no, they don't want to join us.
Yes, I am familiar with this syndrome -- she's a two-face.
Do you think it might be possible to add a little shelf like, uh, for an alarm clock?
(not believing him) You what?!
That's what I wanna know.
So, tell him you're concerned about it and he should see someone else.
I gotta go zoo. I feel like I could set more of my own schedule.
Ok, it's a deal!
They, uh... said you were with some guy who was wearing a cape?...
You're Murphy!
You should've seen her face. It was the exact same look my father gave me when I told him I wanted to be a ventriloquist.
I happen to dress based on mood.
(Guessing the look) Stink eye?
Nice nun.
I don't even drink wine. I drink Pepsi.
I can do this, Jerry.
Don't you see. She's looking at my pictures.
Kramer put Jerry on the phone.
That's it? You don't have to screw it in or anything?
Jerry, I gotta talk to you.
Oh, right! (Shakes her hand) Right! Hey, hey.. I love the floors in here. It's like a gymnasium in here! Try and guard me! (Dribbles an imaginary ball
Give him the jacket.
What was that?
Hey, do you know, Bonnie, I just had a pretty wild idea.
There's Elaine.
Kramer, what are you doing here?
One little bite.
(panicked and rushed) Jerry! The Japanese guys had sake in the hot-tub! You gotta get 'em outta the drawers and get 'em down here, or I don't have a focus group to sell the pilot to Japanese TV!
Yeah, well....
Huge matzoh ball.
What? Nothing.
(opening door) It's a big night. I'm, uh, ice skating with one, and going to a staged reading of "Godspell" with the other.
(singing) Meet the Mets...
This is what my life has come to... Tryin to meet a mute.
Let me be the architect! I can do it!
You know what I would like to do? I would really like to have sex with a tall woman. I mean really tall. Like a like a giant Like six five.
Sorry I'm late.
They could've at least tried!
Yeah, okey, wait wait. That will separate.
Huh, strawberries, anyone? (eats a strawberry) Ah, that's good. Ooh, juicy this time of year.
Oh, I dont get the enthusiastic hi, Im outta there.
Start looking for a job.
Yes, it is exciting! All right, this is gonna be my new face.
I hope so. I can't take him living with me much longer. He makes this kasha, it stinks up the whole house.
Well, go ahead! Do it!
Jon Voight bit you?
So you think she likes me?
I noticed people staring at my head because they like what they see.
No, that's the Netherlands.
I dont know, I cant eat. You, you cant have anything anymore. Look at this, look at this. Eggs out. Coffee out. French fries out. BLT out! I go to visit my grandparents three big brisket sandwiches, Im sittin here with a carrot! Theyre closing in on a hundred, Im sayin to them, How can you eat that stuff? (They look at their menus again.) Im so sick about losin that choose, you dont know.
Too much?
What do the Chinese have to gain by faking a cure for baldness?
I'm sure I will.
Good....good day (not too convincing) You?
"Ah! your just mad 'cause we beat ya."
That's a lot of pressure. Make love to me. What am I, in the circus? What if I can't deliver?
tsh (snorts) Ah, yeah, we've - we've talked . . . I believe I can speak for the both of us on this.
Because, if I'm looking straight ahead, and something enters my field of vision, that's merely a happenstance. (Elaine loudly snaps and unfolds her napkin at the next table to get Russell's attention.)
(Takes it and throws it out window) Get outta my way!
Sorry we're late.
So, is he okay?
What? Rate-aholics?
Busy. Don't give me busy. Who's not busy? I'm busy, we're all busy, everybody's busy. All right, tell me, what's kept you so busy?
A-ha.
Kramer's so stringy. I'm plump, juicy.
Alright, you're in for one-fifty.
Yeah.
Oh no! Im vigilant. Theyll never get me out. Im like a weed, Jerry.
You know this whole thing never would have happened if you hadn't bailed out on me at the restaurant.
Well, Play Now has all kinds of different rubber balls. Why dont we test your bladder system at my office?
So, Marcy, you should've seen me in the hot tub yoday.
Yes, sir. Yes sir, do my best.
Jersey.
Now, I'm aware that my own physical dimensions are perhaps a little short of perfection.
Pull hair, Poke eyes, Groin stuff. Whatever I gotta do. (he opens a blue bottled beverage)
Ah, I've had everything on the menu. Uh, surprise me.
Dead?
Oh, what are you, like, a Quaker now?
(hurriedly leaves Rudy's) They had plans, They had plans!
She might be leaving to work any minute.
How did he do that?
She's confiding in him about our dates. You always like the person you talk to about the date more than the date! It's just a matter of time till they realize, 'Hey, we could have sex.'
Right. Bye.
Oh, I don't think you want to do that.
You know. (All three give him blank stares) I was alone..
What did you put the Pez dispenser on her leg for in the first place?
Yeah.
(grateful, relieved) Thank you! I'm gonna make you both so happy!
Here. (panicky) We'll leave it here for you!
Why, you think I should?
It's all politics.
Well, I do what I can. (Robin comes over.)
I think he was impressed.
'cause I asked him about the raisins.
Latex, latex manufacturing
No, no, no, no, Im It. I win.
(waves his hands) Big breasts!
Yeah, I'm sorry.
Jerry ... Where are you? I know you like to sit back here. Elaine! Susan!
Yeah, I know that. (clears throat) Could you start, working?
Yeah, just tell him to hurry it up.
I could be a character.
Why not?
Oh, its a great place, its uh two-bedroom uh, west 83rd bout half block from the park.
Get out!
All I want is my seventy-five cents back, an apology, and for him to be fired!
There you go.
Well ordinarily I wouldn't mind. But...
She invites me up at twelve oclock at night, for coffee, and I dont go up. No thank you. I dont want coffee. It keeps me up. Too late for me to drink coffee. I said this to her. People this stupid shouldnt be allowed to live. I cant imagine what she must think of me.
Hate the big coarse "ha." Hate those.
No reason!
What hat?
Really?
What is that, Boyfriend? I don't understand that. What, what does she think I asked her out for?
You know what you oughta do. You should go to her office and heckle her.
Apparently the Seinfelds' are too good for us. I shouldn't say anything bad about your uh your partner.
You are?
(hesitatingly) ... no...
Why not?
Guys with cats... I dont know.
Should I apologize to Woody?
Well, maybe they're done with it. I could go pick it up.
Simple joke from a simple man.
Oh well, gracias El Commandante, gracias. Muy muy.
I just wanted a second opinion.
Oh, cmon, Jerry. I cant believe this.
Is it that obvious?
We'll have a good time
(In a really strange way) Good, good, do that.
That was different!
It's in Detroit though, it's an expensive flight.
Okay. Hey, you know what, maybe I should give it to my therapist to read. She's smart, I trust her.
This is a real piece of junk. I don't even feel safe on this thing. I have a good mind to write a letter toMr. Kimbrough.
No! (The salesman walks away. He addresses the mechanic through the doors window) Hey! Hey! I see you! That is my Twix! (The mechanic eats the last of the Twix, obviously to make George even more angered. It works) Oh, ha, ha! Ho, ho!
You know Elaine, I'd do it but I'm working that day.
Do you?
I can't get a massage from a man.
It's George
What happens to charter tickets when you don't use em?
Fine, I'll buy a pack of gum.
Help, someone. (BUBBLE BOY is strangling George)
The dentist thing?
Ha, Yeah right, hang on, Ill ah, Ill get her for you. he, he, he, he. Seriously, what's up?
(PULLING OUT ESTIMATE OUT OF HIS POCKET) Well, profit. I think you'll see from the estimate that I'm not really profiting that much. They might be a little high, but..
What about all the loser stuff?
I'm sorry the card says MOOPS.
I'm getting married?
Kramer?
So what, they don?t have another plane? She couldn't take a bus?
He was really crying?
No keys. And I been calling the city all day. Course there's not really a number to call if you wanna make a pothole.
Hennigans. I was there sitting in the office and the cleaning woman comes in. I've always been attracted to cleaning women. Cleaning women, chambermaids.
How? Cause Im an Idiot.
No. I need a guy that can rig a Frogger machine so that I can move it without losing power, 'cause I have the high score. H-hello?
If there's any doubt, I do a leave-behind. Keys, gloves, scarf -- I go back to her place to pick it up...(pop sound) date number two.
Ah, excuse me, Vice-president Coco, no one cares about your Gammy.
You can't compromise your principles!
What, you should've just asked her.
(knocks) You hem... wanted to see me Mr. Steinbrenner?"
I tell ya, I hear people really stuff themselves on those cruise ships. (Laughs) The buffet, that's the real ordeal, huh, Clarence? (Laughs)
That was very real.
You could eat of that shotgun.
I'm in a transition phase right now.
Taste this, is this a dill?
Boy, it stings.
(muttering)
YES! It Blows Up! If you knew that, what did you tell Elaine for?
Del Boca Vista!
This is unprecedented!
What do they say?
So what happened?
( rubbing his eye) Ow, Ow you squirted me.
Yeah, yeah, sure, Christmas. Snow. Santa. All that stuff.
I dunno. I guess I have to wait for her to die.
You are!
Feels right. (cheerfully takes another bite)
Huh... Cape... (turns, distracted, heads slowly towards door) What was a man with a cape doin' with my father?... What was my father doing with a man in a cape?... (opens door) Why a cape? Hmm! (exits)
Oh, sure. I mean, after all, you were almost my, uh... OK, I gotta go.
Oh, thank you.
You know you buy a big salad for somebody it would be nice if they knew it.
Thinking? Nothing. What could I possibly be thinking?
Once, to a dog. He licked himself and left the room.
Well, was it for Costanza or...
You think it's contact? It has to be touched?
You know, Lloyd, I-I've been to the doctor (hands George the card) there's really nothing they can do.
Yeah. There's something wrong with that? I'm a character. People are always saying to me, "You know you're a quite a character."
Yeah, you're right, you're right. (To Elaine) Alright, maybe he's not interested, but you still know him - can't you just ask him?
I don't believe it, what did you say?
Yeah.
(Interrupting) No!
I need everything in there.
Well, you gotta do it.
Of course it is.
Learn guitar, first lesson free? Huh.
Yeah, I want to see if there's anything I can do.. maybe get him another job.. maybe I'll hear of something.
Pudding skin singles.
"Hey you know , I felt we had like a synergy out there,you know, like we were really helping each other."
Yeah. She's uh, she's something, isn't she?
For a woman.
You know Ava's gonna be there.
Whatever.
Why not?
With all due respect, I don't think so...
Elaine could be a character. Kramer..
(Let down) Yeah, but you - you promised it to me.
What about the skin? I need a good cheek, I like a good cheek.
You got a line in the Woody Allen movie?
I can't tell you.
Listen, sweetheart, let me tell you a little something about guts. (Points to his head.) This is guts.
Ill tell you, if I was running for office I would ask for the death penalty for double-parkers. If this is allowed to go on this is not a society. THIS IS ANARCHY!
Unbelievable, I'm never gonna get out of here. The guy goes to pee, he never comes back. It's like a science fiction story.
I figured you'd cruise. At least through the Spring.
What are they saying now?
You have to drink that whole thing?
Alright, very good, very good...go fold your little balloon animals, Eric. Eric! (chuckles) What kind of name is that for a clown, huh?
No, I did not! (They exit the coffee shop.)
Geez.
Yeah, so you gotta use something else.
Sstill love. Still love.
Oh yeah the nipple. But besides that. How did you feel about Kramer's work?
No, and you weren't funny last night either. In fact, you got us both so depressed, she asked me to drive her home after dinner.
I don't know. That's all gonna change.
I could take it in merchandise..
This is not good. World's are colliding! George is getting upset!
Hi Amy, I'm George.
Mark, is this true?
Why don't you just look at your watch?
(anticipating the answer) Not.
I am eating my dessert. How do you eat it, with your hands?
. . . naw, it's just you thanked HER, and and oh, . . . what's the difference?
Please. (sits again)
This woman just set me up for a job!
You heard it fifty times already.
I didn't know he'd get fired.
Hey.
(talking to nobody) Nah. It's probably a union thing.
Anyway, I think everything else is okay. Unless of course she's faking.
Oh, I sure hope so.
Almost. Couldn't get the girl go out with me the second time.
Dont think it cant happen! (Leaves)
He doesn't feel funny.
What? Why couldn't you think of something?!
No. During.
I am not giving you my code.
You're cutting me off? No, no, no Jerry, don't cut me off!
Now?
Well? (Miranda hits George) I was just - I'm curious, that's all. We, uh. We'd like you to, do everything possible.
Oh, Im Im full of it Father.
And now for the trifecta. (Picks up a hand held TV and gets back under the covers.)
Oh, it's locked?
Yes, she hates cigarettes.
What does the chaperone do?
So what? Ill start talking to him, you know, casual, and Ill work my way around to it.
Should we be talkin' about this?
You?
Oh, I love full lips. Something you can really put the lipstick on.
Nope.
Of course not...
You don't understand. He's got this big party coming up. He's been looking forward to this for months. This is gonna destroy the whole thing.
Oh yeah, you were right. She's gorgeous.
Ho ho. This bizarre ?harrod? experiment must end!
(clipping on shades) Ha.. She'll have to find me first. (leaving)
(to Jimmy) Wh...Where d'you get'em?"
Didn't say anything. (They go into Elaine's apartment.)
uh uh, we're uh ..
You go in and save seats.
Okay. A little.
Maybe she's diabetic.
Well I spoke to Elaine...
What big salad? I'm going to the coffee shop.
(pauses) A marine biologist?
We really should be, uh, heading out..
(shaking hands) I'm George.
Man, I'm starving.
I'd argue if I could, Mrs. Enright. (exits) Here we go, all right.
(frantic by now) SHUT UP,SHUT UP, SHUT UP,...(then leaves)
It's like going to the bathroom in front of a lot of people and not caring.
"step off"?
We'll have 2 slices and 2 grape sodas.
Uh, let me ask you a question. Could you, uh, expand the space underneath a desk to give it a little more headroom?
When did you get this idea?
No something is bunk and then you debunk it.
Yeah, Art Vandelay.
Never.
"How's it going?" - beautiful.
Elaine.. I have to tell you something...
We're slowing down. Are those the people?
I like Mike Lubika.
And you! How many Twix does that make for you, today?! Like, 8 Twix?!
Claire, Claire, youre a woman, right?
Who flips? Youll flip, Ill call.
Oh! I know....'Cos you don't think Janet?..
(attempting sincerity) As much as I'd like to see the two of you living it up in a warm, tropical, setting, I, I would just miss you too much. (smiling) So, I've decided, I want you to stay.
(in his mind) I think that ginger ale at the coffee shop is just Coke and Sprite mixed together. How can I prove it? Ah! Can't, dammit. (knock at door. George goes to open it)
(looking over her resume) Well Miss Coggins you're ah, obviously qualified for the job. You've all the necessary skills and experience. But you're extremely attractive. you're gorgeous. Im looking at you, I can't even remember my name. So ah, Im afraid this is not going to work out (he crumples her resume into a ball) Thanks for coming in.
So, uh, you gonna see him again?
Just CALL!
Too much salt in my diet.
Women like skiers.
What are you doing? You're making more than I am. A secretary cannot make more than her boss.
Thanks.
*Really*.
Cmon. Wilkinsons got millions invested in this stock. Its gone up three points since Ive been watching it.
Enjoy, enjoy.
[as if the word were totally foreign] My `stub'?
Get a good night's sleep, alright fellas. (thumbs up) Big day tomorrow!
Did you ever meet my friend, Simons?
Oh, please. (to the teller) Can you change this into bills?
Wait a minute, Rinitze? Don't they have somme really cool suits in there?
Well, what do they look like?
He wants to talk about "Jerry"?
Maybe like this.
Well, I was wondering...
You open the door to the car, boom, you walk right into the hospital. Eh, You can't beat that spot. (starts doing a little dance) I am on a roll. I'm just willing these great parking spots.
Yeah, yeah. You really cashed in on that favor pretty quick.
(Suggesting) Maybe she's a nudist. You know, those nudist colony people..
I think that's what the back of closets are for.
No, not a loser!
Ovaltine. Have you ever had this stuff? Why is it called Ovaltine?
No... (takes off his glasses and wipes his eyes with his sleeve)
Why don't you think before you do something?
No, no,
(sets down his paper) So how were the eggs?
How'd you hook up with these guys?
I gotta find a way to work this out, I love that apartment. It's so cozy, I'm ensconced in velvet. You know, if it were socially acceptable--
(still looking at that picture) You know if I told my engagement story to that receptionist, but told her this, was my fiance..
Don't be silly.
So, she went out with you on a first date.. and it was her birthday?
Hey, what this thing? Whew!
Well it's over. It's definitely over.
She told me she wants-- (Pauses until a woman coming down the stairs passes) She told me she wants me to make love to her.
Jerry, could you excuse us for a few minutes, please?
Ho ho ho ho! I can't wait for Hanke to come crawling back to me.
Where is she?
Allow me. Why?
No! No!
Oh!
You don't?
Oh yeah?
Absolutely.
Where?
Yeah.
Why, the color?
For vomiting on her vest!
Hamstring.
What?
There's porn.
I just want the both of you to know how much you mean to me, and I love you both very, very much.
(pause) Alright if you think it's too much they don't have to mail the postcards.
Not bills.
A few days go by and a call is placed at a time when Sandy is known to be busy at work. Once the initial awkwardness is relieved with a little playful humor, which she [Laura] of course cannot resist, an invitation to a friendly dinner is proffered.
(innocent) What?
(more nervous) What are you talking about?
Does she care? No. Does anyone ever display the slightest sensitivity over the problems of a fellow individual? No. No. A resounding no!
I uh, took care of that.
Well, should I call you later?
Oh no no no no - we have to be in California next week. We're starting a TV show.
Good. I think you forgot something.
Kramer, trust me, this is the best bathroom in midtown!
I'M NOT A LIER!
And you really believe this guy doesn't want to have kids.
Yeah, people who work at NORAD, whore on twenty-four hour missile watch. Everything was going along so great. She was laughing, I was funny... I kept saying to myself, Keep it up, dont blow it, youre doing great.
Alright, alright, I'll go on the date, but that's that.
I gotta go.
Guys, hitting is not about muscle. It's simple physics. Calculate the velocity, v, in relation to the trajectory, t, in which g, gravity, of course remains a constant. (Hits a home run) It's not complicated.
Well, I gotta do somethin'. (Walks over to bathroom. Kramer enters)
No. But I was the only one at the table that didn't get violently ill.
Bar?
Um, I don't uh, really think I can go.
Oh, you do?
(to Carrie) It's just that, I know her, and boy...
Alright, so, go ahead.
Well I still think it was wrong.
You don't remember me?
Hey, they can't go, "Hey! You look fabulous!"
Yes.
(harassed) Are you aware that I'm being charged for Tuesday's appointment? I had to take my mother to the chiropodist.
What did I get the veggie burger for? You got a veggie burger, so I had to get the veggie burger, I'm allover crums...
I dunno. I was just talking to the man and he walked out on me!
What are you talking about? (Jerry grins) You're not!
Yes! Yes, I'm the one! Hey! So, you know Jon Voight!
Oh, I think so, and I can prove it. You see, I was doodling on the bill and uh, so if you have a twenty in there with big lips on it... well, (smiles) that's mine. Would you mind opening up the register?
They're men with jobs, Jerry! They wear suits and ties. They're married, they have secretaries.
Aw c'mon.
(Expressing shock) Woah. Whoa! Woah!
Yeah?
Hey, what about this? I'm in a car accident. The motorist is uninsured, you with me?
Oh yeah.
Little baked beans
Okay.
Would you believe my luck? The first time in my life I have a good answer to the question, "What do you do?" and I have a girlfriend. I mean, you don't need a girlfriend when you can answer that question. That's what you say in order to get girlfriends. Once you can get a girlfriend, you don't want a girlfriend, you just want more girlfriends.
Laura, sure.
What accident?
You dont like tippy toe?
Yes.
What'dya got?
Do you really think I'm wrong about this Wyck guy?
Drink your soda! Come on! I know you're there, laughing at me. Laughing and lying and laughing! I had to go to Reggies, Jerry! Reggies!
Well there is traffic. It might take her till eight-fifteen.
(proffering glasses) I hope prune juice is alright. It's the only thing I had that was chilled.
See now this I don't get.
Uh. (smiles) Where's the boys?
Well, I'm sorry, Timmy...but I don't dip that way. (takes a chip.)
Be right with you. Look Mr. Steinbrenner.
No.
Always late. Always late.
Weren't you supposed to call Elaine?
Because if I watch it at my apartment I feel like I'm not doing anything. If I watch it here, I'm out of the house; I'm doing something.
(Losing it) does not imply transfer of ownership. Moe, Sol, or Lem is not gonna get away with this!
How'd the Mets do?
Bring it on, baby
Coming up.
What about me?
Probably because this whole Universe is against me!
She'll Twirl.
You know, if I could get this Coco woman down to Kruger, they wouldn't be able to call me Koko anymore because Kruger would never allow 2 Kokos.
Dad, you really should lay off the 'serenity now' stuff.
Well a lot of people consider me small and prestigious.
You see... All right I knew it.
Why do you have to be so suspicious of every one. This is a great man Zeng Zau, he wants to help bald people.
I broke 'em playing basketball.
(stares at card)
So you - you really don't have my hat?
I know, swan dives from twenty floors up, lands right on top. What do I got a bulls eye up there? He couldn't move over two feet? Land on the sidewalk. It's city property.
Well that was a really stupid thing! You know what's going to happen now?
Could she do that at Kruger?
Well all right, beautiful, so you stop in. Ya, ya visit the bubble boy for twenty minutes and then we can go.
Your friend is been accused of being a serial killer. I think that qualifies.
What are you? Satan? I'm close to a job here. It's my second interview with them.
I'll have 'em overnight it.
You just checked your watch. Are you thinking of bailing on him?
Jerry? Why?
Yeah, right.
Oh, so you don't believe me either?
Congratulations...congratulations.
A garden! I cant believe theres a garden!
(to Jerry) You watch the old videos. (insistent) I'm telling you, look at him.
They can...
You told him? What did you tell him?
Interesting.
The whole hour just flew by. (laughs - hehe) (Begins cleaning up the table.)
You start flirting with him and I'll come by and, while you're keeping him busy, I'll slip it in his drink.
You know, anything in the, in the lip area is good.
It's not the money!
Uh, yeah. Do you know Babs?
Elaine, shes a psychic. She knows how the kids going to be.
Watch me.
She tolerated the strawberries and the chocolate sauce, but eh, it's not a meal, you know? Food and sex, those are my two passions. It's only natural to combine them.
Should I leave this..?
Did she say anything about, uh...
Hey.
Uh, here.
Of course.
...Six wrong?
There could be more than one O'Brien on a plane who ordered a limo.
(Once again, still on the shower) Could it be lukewarm?
I usually spend Saturday afternoons with Susan. She's gonna want to know what I'm doing. I can't use Jerry, he's in Florida.
So what do you care?
Who was it?
Who's got the receipt?
ALL RIGHT!!
I'm a college graduate. You want me to be a mailman?
Well I was just going to wander the streets. Don't wanna tag along with you or anything.
Yes! I see enormous potential here.
Why do you keep saying Nina?
Like a "Hey your mother is uglier than Hazel. Hazel really puts your mother to shame"
I can't. I gotta make the weekly call to the folks.
Let me ask you a question. Who would win in a fight between you and me?
Hey, you know, we haven't brought the Elaine character into the show yet. Umm, We should try and get her into this scene.
You coulda damaged my hand!
That was an honest mistake.
I'm gonna do it.
(answers phone, good mood) Hey.
(angrily) Oh you mother...
Yeah. Did you do it?
No.
Yeah. What's that?
Hi.
So, we watching the movie, or are we still talking? (Joe's wife shakes her head and goes into the other room. George gestures to Remy to move.) Okay, c'mon. Let's go.
About the pizza?
No.
Very curious.
I know!
I'm really serious. I think that's a good idea.
Oh, its from Les Miserables. I went to see it last week. I cant get it out of my head. I just keep singing it over and over. It just comes out. I have no control over it. Im singin it on elevators, buses. Im singin it in front of clients. Its taken over my life.
Tragic.
Me, too.
My dad was a cook during the Korean War. Something very bad happened, ever since you can't get him near a kitchen.
Well, I'm just expressing my gratitude to our gracious host.
Why?!
Oh, that's a dangerous fruit. It's like a weapon that thing, got spikes on the end. You can get killed from one of those things.
You can't leave! This is an ambulance! This is an emergency!
Yeah, I turned him down.
Not the point!
Yeah. Just take 'em out and ride 'em around for about..half an hour.
No. Semi-daily. Four or five times a week.
(thinking of the moans) Heh. (Karen takes another puff of her cigarette) You seem like you really enjoyed your Risotto. (chuckles) You have a very contented air over there. (chuckles again) You look very contented, very satisfied. (pauses) Are you satisfied?
I'm just gonna...wash. (George walks to the bathroom; screaming) WHY DID I PUT UP TWO? WHY DID I PUT UP TWO?
Oh, get outta here.
No not really.
Where the hell is this car, Kramer?
What? Must be a big one.
Doing quite well, thank you. Yesterday I had a soft boiled egg and a quickie. You know what? If I could add TV to the equation, that would really be the ultimate.
How ya doing?
(visibly disturbed) I...I..I dunno.
Well, didn't he regift the label maker?
Then who are the Dutch?
Alright. Listen, I gotta get some reading done. You mind if I do this here? I can't concentrate in my apartment.
Yeah. Why, what do you do?
How do you feel? Confident?
I'm not following.
Well, it's . . . much too low.
Hey Glenn!
I told her I liked her. Why? Why did I tell her I like her? I have this sick compulsion to tell women how I feel. I like you I dont tell you.
alright alright, I gotta buy some bread
No, no I do. You know it's just...
Okay. Uh, my mother is is going to pay for the sessions. ... Oh,Elaine?
...yeah, my wife started getting on me about the lawn today. Im tellin you, its one thing after another.
Ah ha, well, I really wouldn't know about that. I don't watch much TV. I like to read. So what do you do, a lot of that "did you ever notice?" this kind of stuff.
I told them I have a place in the Hamptons. What did you say?
Where are you living? Are you here? Are you on this planet? It's impossible. It can't be done.
You would think that at the end of the week when they hand out the checks, throw in a few soaps.
Me neither.
Yeah.
No. Why must it be so difficult? Why is there all this tension and hostility? Why can't I just walk up to a woman on the street and say, "Hi. I'm
Oh, it's not mine. It's my mother's.
I know, I know. Listen, your stuff has to be done by now, why dont you just see if its dry?
Ill tell her I bumped into you, Im giving you a ride uptown.
I'm gonna play frolf.
So eh, what do you say?
Well, that interests me very much Mr. Farkus.Very much indeed, sir.
Do you think she gets to take any of those little bars of soap home?
Like what? I'm bald? What is it specifically? Is, is there an odor I'm not aware of?
Not yet. Oh! Ho ho! God...
What's it gonna be?
Ahh. Good for you.
That's right.
You see I disagree. I'd rather be dating the blind. You know you could let the house go. You could let yourself go. A good looking blind woman doesn't even know you're not good enough for her.
Where the hell is your father?!
But why?
Um, cream soda?
Hello? Amanda. Hi, yes. Listen. You know, I'm thinkin', we might just be better of bein' friends. Yeah. Yeah, you know what, I can't even really talk about it right now. Bye-bye. (hangs up) (happy with himself, but then sees the burned up photo) No! No!
She comes out of the bathroom, I'm in up to my wrist. You should have seen the look on her face.
When are they gonna learn that any news about China is an instant page-turner? (seeing Jerry with a small black device) What's that?
I enjoy understanding.
Superman's father on Krypton.
So what?! She still gave you advice; what's the difference if she's not Chinese?!?!
Five hundred dollars, that?s a great deal!
What kind of operation is it?
Elaine? It's me, George. (Elaine opens the door.) Hey, sorry to bother you so late. (To Billy) Hey! How ya doin.' (To Elaine) Uh, did you get any of those sponges?
Very.
No one gives us the finger! We're Yankees!
Boy oh boy.
You-you sure you never slept with her? (Jerry shakes his head 'no') Perfect.
(impatient) What about Marisa Tomei?!
I gotta go back to the library and talk to him. I gotta find out if I&Mac226;m the guy who ruined his life.
What a movie. Good choice.
Hi. (waves to Donald and laughs) hahahaha.
Oh, you know what you're like? You're like a pathetic gambler. You're one of those losers in Las Vegas who keeps thinking he's gonna come up with a way to win at blackjack.
Where are you gettin' a Wizard for fifty dollars?
(laughing) You think you're going to the other side with "Hi"? You're not going to make it.
No, no, no, no.
It's not me! It's the car!
Hey, you gotta take a ride with me later. I borrowed my father's car. '68 GTO.
Yes! Yes, I heard the 'squink'!
Oh, he'll be here. By the way, Elaine, (reaches under the table and brings out a large coffee machine) thank you for laying out for the Arabian mocha java.
(George, finger in the peanut butter jar) This is what I do.
Oh, she's got the hue. So, what's going on with you and Melanie? I mean, I know you're not getting married, but uh, things are happening?
Wha?
(singing) Master of the House/Quick to catch your eye/Never wants a passerby to pass him by...
So I set up a screening, everyone takes their shirt off and click, I snap me a shot of a bear-chested Kruger.
My little man doesn't know.
(doing the voice) La la la.
(Mr.Wilhelm comes in and hears George yelling) You tell that son of a bitch no Yankee is ever comin' to Houston! Not as long as you bastards are running things!
Oh, Hi, I'm George. (they shake hands)
Hey - What's going on?
So now, the father is screaming at me, he's demanding that I pay for the boom box. Finally, I gave them a fake address and got the hell out of there.
(to Donna) Why did you have to get me in trouble?
Good morning Mr. Wilhelm.
Well what did you want her to do, you left it on the night table.
You did all this...for a pinky toe?
Oh, what time is it? Eight thirty? I'll tell you what's on. You got Major Dad, Blossom, very funny programme...
Exactly.
Oh, no no no. I was just looking for stock-pages. Here it is. Looking for the quotes. Gotta check to quotes. Love a good quote. Oh, IBM up a quarter.
Never mind what happened, just give me the key.
I can't believe you called me a chucker. No way I'm a chucker, I do not chuck, never chucked, never have chucked, never will chuck, no chuck!
I dont know. Theyre books.
I had 'em, Jerry. They loved me.
C'mon, you took my seat.
rush? you want a rush? drop a ball on your toe my friend, talk about a rush, you'll be throbbing, you'll see visions
So, you're taking his side?
You know, the guy from Cheers.
This is great!
Well, it's all over. I slipped up.
I'm not stable? I'm like a rock. I take these glasses off, you can't tell the difference between me and a rock. I put these glasses on a rock. You know what jumps into most people's minds? Costanza!
Excuse me. I believe you just ate my Twix bar. It was dangling. And when you purchased your Twix bar, you got a little freebie, and you never bothered to ask why, or seek out its rightful owner.
(laughs) Youd have to be a real loser to try something like that.
Maybe she could like me? Is it that far fetched? Maybe she sees something? Is it possible?
Hello, oh, hello. You remember, ... Susan, from N B C.
Fantastic day! Fantastic!
What is that?
Ma, guess what!
I like, uh...(mutters something unintelligible under his breath.)
No Doctor--
(shouting) Turn your key, Maura. Turn your key!
What?
What do you wanna do?
Great.
So what do you do?
Great. (They both stand.) Oh, by the way, did you get a chance to read the script?
George, don't make me get tough with you. Whu, hu, hu, hu huuuu (raises arms) Who says that? She is really cool. What do you think? You think she likes me?
Specific, Ah, lets see. I've walked in and out of so many buildings they all .. blend in together, I uh, ..
She might not be comfortable.
Yeah, (cough) Definite smoke.
(Rejecting) Ohh, no. No, no, no..
"Yeah,yeah yeah yeah! I've seen these.....they sorta ..they make your legs..stronger."
You see, you see? I see things as they are and I say, 'no!' Uh, wait, you see things as they are not and you s- Wait, uh, you see things, do you see things as they are? What do you say when you see things?
(Relieved) I haven't? I'm okay? I'm okay? Oh, thank you, thank you, Doctor! I don't know how to thank you.
What about that spot I got?
Hey look a that - boy are you lucky - another great spot - right in front of the hospital. In an emergency yet! How lucky are you huh? Is that unbelievable? How unbelievable is that huh? Come on, give it to me, give it to me.
A billiard parlor?
We got a soccer game in Chile. Anyway, the plane crashes. Who are you gonna eat to survive?
Yeah, and you were engaged for like a minute, I was engaged for a year.
Smarter than me? I don't want anyone smarter than me.
Convulsing?
I left three messages. I can't believe this woman. She has sex with me, leaves ten minutes later then I never hear from her again. What kind of a person does this? I mean, she used me. I feel cheap and violated.
So the Wig master.......the Wig master said you could stop by the theater tonight.. and he'll show you around.
Alright, here we go.
Woo! Some day out there - You ever see weather like that? Woo! It's crisp - it's crispy crisp.
(a little worried) He uh, he doesn't have the auto shop any more?
Well, OK. As I said the guy had it in for me. He actually failed me in gym. ... ME!
Why? Why isn't it possible? I mean, they're both bite marks.
Yea... (sinks in) What? No, no!
Listen, listen, dont get worked up, cause youre gonna know the whole story the minute she steps off the plane.
Dammit!
All right, stop it! Stay away from my breasts! Chest!
what are you doing here?
Of course it's cashmere.
And get a picture of him, with his shirt off.
What a bald paradise that must have been. Nobody knew.
Well why'd she do that?
Finicky? Prissy? Fastidious?
Better get that checked out?
Thank you.
Now you're off on a topic.
(Standing in the doorway) I'm fine with it! Fi-hi-hi-hine I say! (Leaves)
[realizing the only way out is to show the stub] I've got the stub.
Its fabulous.
That's why we're here in America.
Hi. I'm ah, I'm here to see a Mr. Art Vandelay..
Ahh, Ah-AhWe had a deal!
(knocking on the counter and feigning a muffled, Chinese voice) Chinese food!
Murphy Brown, the TV show.
My moneys all tied up in change right now.
I'm not gonna be nice. That's how I got the job.
Maybe it's got something to do with that 42 in the corner .
What are you gonna do?
Does that mean I have to go too?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's it. More of that, difficult. I'm a difficult seed.
Never mind.
Hey, where ya goin'?
You're Killing Independent George! You know that, don't you?
What do you mean Wednesday? I though we had tickets to the Knick game Wednesday. We got seats behind the bench! What happened? Were not going?
They refuse to put cucumber in the salad. I need cucumber.
Must be hell living in that house.
Hey could you do one other thing for me?
Personally I'm a little nervous about going through these things. I'm afraid I'm gonna step through into another dimension.
It's standard. Has she left you one of those messages where she uses up the whole machine?
Really?
Yo, Anna.
I didn't burn it down - Kramer did!
Hey uh let me take you're coat.
(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o!
I think.
I hate this mall, there are never any spaces here...
(Reluctantly) Yeah.
So are you going to Todd's party this weekend?
Then afterwards maybe we could all go out together. Y'know she'll see me with my friends, she'll observe me as I really am, as myself. Maybe I can get some hand that way.
He still wins but it's not a blowout.
So?
I mean it's hard enough to meet a woman you dislike, much less like.
This is all too much. So what are you feeling? What's going on? Are you like a couple again now?
Actually, I never had any formal training. I guess I'd be better suited for improvs, or something..
Alright, well you know what'cha gotta do, you gotta go through her purse. Y'know, the-the credit cards, driver's license...
Oh, it's the chicken and the egg...
What side?
(George puts on the headphones) Oh! my god...
Yes. Now take off those pants.
You know, I think I'm a little bit scared of her. She's five-three, like a hundred pounds. I'm frightened to death of her.
You saw him. He was fiddling with the engine. God knows what he did there.
Ma!
Pamela?! Awright, I tell you what. You look like nice people, I'm gonna help you out. You want a beautiful name? Soda.
Oh ho! Class, huh? At Columbia? Let me tell you something, pal. I called the registrars office. I checked you out. They have no record of a Ray Thomas at that school! You liar!
Really? (feeling flattered)
How ya doin'?
My whole life has been a complete waste of time, (chuckle)
Exactly! Because neither one of us can't handle a woman all by ourselves.
I got a big problem here, Jerry. The tapes are worthless.
Oh yeah, right. When's he coming back?
Yeah! That's how they talk. You know, everyone's either a bastard or a son of a bitch. Yeah, it's like uh..."boy, that son of a bitch Box can really hit, uh?!" (laughs)
Well does it say anywhere in the contract about my car being used as a whorehouse? 'Cause I don't remember reading that clause either..
This friend of Susan's is staying with us for two weeks...Now am I wrong or is that excessive?
Algae, obviously plankton, hmhm. I don't know what else I could tell ya, ah, Oh I-I just got back from a trip to the Galapagos Islands, I was living with the turtles.
Shadow!
What if it felt good?
Wheret?
Yes, yes, you know I was in detention and she came up behind me while I was erasing the blackboard . . .
Wha - what are you doing later?
(Obviously lying) No.
Yeah, anyway, she's uh, having some kind of a family lunch, I'll swing by after.
To some degree.
What am I supposed to get, a bazooka?
Yes! And I put him up to it, because I'm sick! I'm the one that needs help.
So you're a lawyer. What kind of cases do you handle?
How can you just get it?
(Extremely blunt) Burned.
What a world that would be, if you just could ask a woman what shes thinkin.
And now?
No, not nice. She's stickin' it to me.
Me, why?
ALL the way, baby!
We'll take it!
"Jerry"!
Likewise.
So, uh, Mom, Dad, I was hoping that you could help me to remember my childhood a little clearly..
Gotta go.
(pleading) Elaine, c'mon. Would you just make the call? (indicates the phone) Please, make the call.
What do you mean?
Well, this is a lovely apartment. Lovely! My kids are gonna go crazy. I, uh, I wonder if I could see the bathrooms. Preferably one with some paint thinner and, uh, some rags?
(standing up) I'm just gonna go to the bathroom.
What signal? What-what signal?
You didn't tell her.
Here's the TV. I know you wanted to watch the Super Bowl. Do you at least have some towels we could sit on? It's, like, a four hour game.
Oh, these are my friends, Elaine and Jerry, ... Noel
There's nothing I can even impart to you, that's the sad thing. It's so inborn, I can't pass it on. (begins backing into the space) Look at this guy. Are you crazy, what are you doing?! Hey! Hey, you're stealing my space!
It gets here when it gets here. Would you stop ridin' me?
Instinct.
You were supposed to deliver my calzones. We had a deal!
(Opens the door, looks in and then knocks 5 times) Mr. Steinbrenner, (waves) can I talk to you for a second?
Well, it's kind of a mystery, isn't it?
Somebody double parked and blocked us in. D-DOES ANYBODY KNOW WHOSE CAR THAT IS? Maybe there's a note on it. Ohh-oh brother. No, no note. Can you believe this?
Oh! you taped it?
So who am I to be thinking about someone's nose? I mean, I should be grateful someone like her even looks at me. I have no job, nothing. But I have to say, I think about the nose. I don't want to think about the nose. I don't ask to think about the nose, but I think about it. I go to bed at night, I tell myself, 'Don't think about the nose, forget the nose,' but I think about it. I look at her, I see nose.
It's "ooh" As in "ooh ooh ah ah."
That's a myth.
I've been to the movies.
So, they go off for the ride, by the time they come back the bread is there.
Im the judge and the jury, pal. And the verdict is guilty!
Funny guy, huh?
No, really. No, no, thanks.
So, you didn't think this was a date?
What's the difference you just read it and mail it right back. These we'll do.
Why didn't you just tell her?
What about your old car? They couldn't get Kramer's blood out of it?
All right. There's nothing to be worried about. She's just a little annoyed right now. Tomorrow I'll personally go over there. I'll apologize. I'll get the papers. Don't worry. Don't worry. (exits)
Uh, Rick..
Married , What!(astounded)
It just came to me.
Yeah, but nothing happens on the show. You see, it's just like life. You know, you eat, you go shopping, you read.. You eat, you read, You go shopping.
Oh, ... some stupid movie...
All right. You wanna know what one of her favorite expressions is? Happy, Pappy?
Oh, ok. Thank you. It was good talking to you.
Well, not recently. I craved. I crave all the time, constant craving...but I haven't yearned.
(he just took a bite of the Chinese food ) This is terrible. What is this, ginger? I hate ginger. I can't understand how anyone can eat ginger. (puts the container back in the refrigerator.)
Important step. Maybe the most important.
So, uh, gentlemen, do we have a deal?
Look at this.
Really? You like it? I got it at a flea market today.
Ohhhh...
No, impossible! Its your apartment.
Oh, he stole it!
Oh! Here you are. Ha ha...You, uh, you want to--
(disappointed) Oww.
(little subdued) Nakahama Broadcast Corporation.
You want to be with somebody that doesn't like you.
Um, all right, um, uh, I'll call 'ya. I'll call you and we'll talk on the phone. A telephone communiqu. Every thing is fine ok, uh, fine, .. [exits]
Its bad?
millions and millions
Yeah. Got to invite The Drake. Listen hem...there's something that's been on my mind and we haven't really talked about it..I t's kind of important to me.
Hey, you like?
I dont know, what were doin here, this is ridiculous.
Yeah you did, you classed it up!
No no no, I got it.
What are you talking about?
Oh, no, thanks. I cant drink coffee late at night, it keeps me up.
You bought non-refundable tickets, you idiot!
This is a fantastic place! I always thought it was a meat packing plant!
It's dismissive.
It moved! It was imperceptible but I-I felt it.
I though we said we weren't going to discuss that now!
Hu, oh. No he thought I was hiding something from him about Morgan.
Had to come in and maybe well get together? Had to and maybe?
I got a date with Karen. I don't know what I'm gonna do. Nothing happening down there.
Come on 'Oh George, oh Geeeooorge!' Come on! Not that I don't appreciate the effort that was put into it.
Jerry, look at my eyes.
Was my father wearing a cape?
When Lupe makes up the beds in the morning.
Isn't that why we have locks on the doors?
(TO JERRY, SOMEWHAT IMPRESSED) A Red Chinese prison?
What?
(thinking) Oh my God, it's 701. What have I done? My whole plan is depending on Kramer? Have I learned nothing? How could I make such a stupid mistake? He'll never show up!
Yeah, well, she's trying to track you down.
I cant believe what Im hearing.
Mmm, no. Boy, it really didn't come out too well, did it?
Oh, hello Professor.
All right. (smiles behind her back)
(chases after her) Wait a minute! You're--now you're getting a divorce because she's from Long Island?!?!
I hear everything.
Don't worry, we'll find something for you. (Knock of Jerry's door)
What is it about sex that just disrupts everything? Is it the touching? Is it the nudity?
Wax Museum.
All right. It's grovel time.
Nah, he didn't have anything to do with it...
Elaine, shut-up.
Koko.
(to Jerry) "You know those shoes that Jimmy had? I cut a deal with him. We're gonna import a case of them together."
Why?
It's not the same.
Hey.
I was trying to loosen 'em up a little bit.
Yeah, you're just so... hip.
..Oh boy.
uh, Uh, Vandelay Industries, is uh. 129 West 81st street. It's a very small industry Vandelay. It's one of the reasons I wanted to uh, work for them.
Oh, yeah. I read what you said to the papers yesterday. You weren't in on the planing. What planning? YOU THINK WE PLANED THIS? Uh?
It's that bleak? (pours a glass of milk)
By the way, how did Puddy get back in the picture?
Hmm, what's he doin' in the city today?
Why?
I like herbal tea.
This...is an organizer, a secretary, and a friend.
Ok, everybody, uh...I have an announcement to make. From now on, I will be known as-
Yes, Id like to report a problem with one of your mechanics.
Summer of '89 I'm at the beach. This family sits up next to me. I go in to the surfs and when I come from out, my clothes, my towel, my umbrella, they're all gone. I am furious, I start screaming to these kids demanding my stuff back and finally I lose it; I grab their boom box and I chuck it in to the ocean.
She had a dude?
I- I'm pretty sure I left it eh, behind the cushion of the chair ... accidentally.
Clearer
So...?
I saw "Titanic". So that old woman, she's just a liar, right?
And Ill tell you something else, Im not even going to ask you. I want to know. But Im not gonna ask. Youll tell me when you feel comfortable. So what was it? Four hundred? Five hundred? Did you pay five hundred for this? (Jerry coyly ignores Georges questions, while George grows increasingly serious.) Over six? Cant be seven. Dont tell me you paid seven hundred dollars for this jacket! Did you pay seven hundred dollars for this jacket? Is that what youre saying to me? You are sick! Is that what you paid for this jacket? Over seven hundred? What did you pay for this jacket?! I wont say anything. I wanna know what you paid for this jacket! Oh my God! A thousand dollars?! You paid a thousand dollars for this jacket?! All right, fine. (George heads for the door.) Im walking outta here right now thinking you paid a thousand dollars for this jacket, unless you tell me different. (Jerry remains silent.) Oh, ho! All right! Ill tell you what, if you dont say anything in the next five seconds, Ill know it was over a thousand.
Never happened.
My face! My face! Get me to the hospital!
(hopeful) So, details?
Whoa! Whoa! Geez!
You have to stand tough sir. That's why I had to hang up the phone.
Well perhaps, not to the extent that you are. But I know the basic plot. Yeah.
Hey, by the way, if anybody wants an inside tour of the zoo, Siena works there as a trainer.
Oxygen! I need some oxygen! This is major.
It's me.
Absolutely. You just tell him the truth.
Perhaps. (hehe) I walk in, everything is organized -- messages, appointments. And I can't tell you how proud I am of myself for going with Ade.
Well what if she calls me? What am I supposed to say?! (hand hits the table)
Elaine?
All right, I'll tell them my sister died. (Starts fake crying) My poor sister died. She was standing and then she was laughing and then they SHOT her! That's the kind of sick city that we're livin' in. They shoot you for laughing. I must go and comfort my poor family. Jerry, take me home so I can comfort my... my poor family.
Coulda fixed me up with Marisa Tomei. She said I was just her type!
So I still haven't heard about that job.
God! She's cooking dinner for God! She's yelling and screaming, and the next thing I know, she throws a big can of chocolate syrup all over my new red shirt.
Friars.
I think I understand this. Jay Peterman is real. His biography is not. Now, you Kramer are real.
Oh, look, he's going to ask you about my arm. So, just tell him I banged it against a desk. And it's been moving involuntarily ever since.
How much is that?
We'd have to kill him.
Alright ok. You got the tape?
Uh... hey. I'm gonna get going.
Did I tell you I ran into her last week? Ho-ho, she looked great.
It's a spanish dish. It's a moulage of fish, an meat with rice. Very tasty.
Oh, what's the point? When I like them, they don't like me, when they like me, I don't like them. Why can't I act with the ones I like the same way I do with the ones I don't like?
Well... we could dance around it a little first.
(standing) C'mon, what're you talking about?
(meekly) Well, it's true. I saw it.
[pause] Tonight?
No, that's a fair question. It is, uhm... (nervous chuckle) Jerry, yeah. (to Cynthia) Jerry's a friend of mine. (to Russell) He uh, he gave it to me. Unbelievable how many addresses of people this guy has.
Hey, I'm his nephew, all right? Don't worry about it. Go ahead. Check it out.
Yes, yes I am.
So, what are you saying?
Her scalp was clean. She had a nice skull. There just wasn't a lot of hair on it.
That's right. I'm two in the hole!
I got lost on the way over.
Oh don't-
Really?
I don't see how I could perform sexually in a situation after something like that. I was completely emasculated. Anyway, it's not the only reason.
Should I not go on this trip?
Yeah, much better. All right, so what's the move, because I need *something*. This woman I'm dating, it's like she's doing her nails during love-making.
Right. I mean, we're on a subject. Why does it have to be changed?
What happened to Putty?
. . . gone?
Playground equipment.
There he is. Right on time as usual.
What is that? B.O.?
Really? (Jerry shakes his head) Maybe this will become like a cool thing, living with your parents.
Every summer you guys went to camp together. I was jealous. Felt like he was the summer me.
Call the Embassy.
Because if there's any doubt at all I...I feel we should cultivate it.
Why do I get pesto? Why do I think I'll like it? I keep trying to like it, like I have to like it.
Wait, wait wait, not so fast. Jerry, you gotta take me to get this thing refinished.
Hey.
Whatever. Listen, I'm very concerned about this guy.
He knows that!
(Changing subject) Hey, I htink I may have found someone for the scholarship.
Yeah.
Yeah, You remember the, the little eh, bank book, there?
You know what? I should really go talk to her. Nothing confrontational. Just two adults sitting down trying to clear the air. You know, I just know if I could spend some time alone with her. I've got to. (he grabs his jacket) I've got to.
Really!
I got a job interview. They want to see me this afternoon.
They could kick me out of the health club if he tells them!
Well, at the Yankees it was all about smoothing things over, you know, chiseling away, grinding down. In fact we used to call it 'the grind'.
You can stuff you sorries in a sack, mister!
I was not winking you idiot. That was the grapefruit. It's like acid. I need that card back. It's Mr. Steinbrenner's. I was responsible.
Not now Florice.
I tell ya, I am hooked on these books on tape.
I told you.
Well what's in this giant box out in the hall?
Wow. Nice.
I couldn't have breakfast, it was lunchtime! The three hour time difference threw me. I wanted a tuna fish sandwich, they wouldn't serve me tuna fish sandwich, because they were only serving breakfast.
Anyway, I think the guy in the shower opposite saw me. He gave me a dirty look.
Mon...? No, no, I can't wait til Monday, that's impossible, I gotta talk to him now. Where does he live?
What's the difference? Let's go to Reggies.
(pulls a face) I find it disorienting. Who buys an umbrella anyway? Y..you get 'em for free in the coffee shop in the metal cans.
Me? No, no, I don't, I don't. Doing very well, very well, yep.
Oh I got it. (TO JERRY) That I'm supposed to remember. Where the car is, that's insignificant.
Svenjolly. (licking a little bit of peanut butter from his finger)
Pst. (moves in close with Elaine and Jerry) Wilkinsons got a bite on a new one. Petramco Corp. Out of, uh Springfield. I think. Theyre about to introduce some sort of a robot butcher.
(Sincerely) Thank you.. I, uh.. that might not work out.
Yeah.
They'll call back.
You heard the man. I guess you gotta be moving your car.
Why didn't you just say that?
How do I get the hand?
I broke up with her.
I like sports. I could do something in sports.
(backing off) Huh? All right, fine.
Ade you are incredible
Yes, and I'm speaking at a men's' conference.
Oh yeah, but that has nothing to do with it.
Tennis courts? W-w-what about the yard? Where do they have the gang fights?
Come on, hurry up, old man! I'm an animal!
You think she would care about the red dot?
Ha! (snort) Can you believe it? (amused) I'm supposed to be havin' lunch with her right now at Pomodoro.
Dad, he doesn't need to see the pole.
Let me ask you a question. This new move. Is there a knuckle involved in any way?
We're perfect. I timed this out so we would pull up at the terminal *exactly* 17 minutes after their flight is supposed to land. That gives them just enough time to get off the plane, pick up their bags and be walking *out* of the terminal as we roll up. I tell you, it's a thing of beauty. I can not express to you the feeling I get from a perfect airport pickup. (starts looking around) What's going on? What are you doing? The Long Island Expressway? What are you getting on the Long Island Expressway for? Do you know what the traffic will be like? This is a suicide mission!
Im outta there. I did it! Its over.
No.
Bother, wa', what kind of bother?
Hey, hey hey. Don't worry about me. I'm not a waffler. I don't waffle!
Phil, I loved those cigars! Incoming! (Flicks his card tward Phil)
Yeah, he's right.
Guess who he put in charge of Fitted Hat Day? Me.
So, she doesnt move in.
I mean, they're retired.
You don't? Boy, I think about it a lot. I think about it at my age. Imagine how much I'll be thinkin' about it at your age. All I'll do is keep thinkin' about it until it drives me insane...
So do I, but I wouldn't hang it on a wall.
(running out and away from the van) I knew it wasn't Berkowitz!
"Cold showers? They're for psychotics."
Are there terrorists on the plane? A hotel fire. Is that it? Malaria? Yellow fever? Lupus? Is it Lupus?
What do you mean you will? That's a bad idea. Jerry is a very private person.
The Chinese have done it my friend. The Chinese have done it.
Oh mother of God.
What is Pericles?
(worked up) Because if she gets it back, then you'll have no reason to be sour. You'll de-sour, right?
Right.
Ive had my difficulties.
A dry-cleaning bill?
I can't park in a garage.
Dark and disturbed? His whole life revolves around Superman and cereal. I convinced him to act like that so that you would think I was funnier. That's how disturbed I am! If you want disturbed, that's disturbed. You can't find sickness like that anywhere, you think sickness like that grows on trees? Nobody is sicker than me, nobody. He's pretending, I'm the genuine article.
Yes, In fact, her mother is in the hospital right now. It's some kind of a Diverticulitis. (he continues walking slowly towards Steinbrenners desk)
Yeah, yeah, but he doesn't wear glasses.
Im aware of you. (to Jerry) All right, lets go (opens the bathroom door) Lets go!
No. And he's not a pig-man is he?
(worried) Why not?
Yeah.
She didn't like me?
It's like the manager coming out and asking you for the ball.
Holes! I need holes!
Because I promised her.
I don't think so, Vic. I've done my homework. '89 Volvo, that's the car for me, it's the one I want.
Well I gotta go talk to Beth.
(Putting his hands up) Alright, alright, hold on! (Jerry has George's full attention) Time out! Woah, woah! (Scooting in, giddy) What did she say?
Yeah, I never know what's going on there.
How'd you get that?
I cant call her now. Its too soon. Im planning a Wednesday call.
Really? I thought you and Celia were sleeping together?
Yeah...(scratching his head) full.
No, she wasn't on the horse.
I think I may be in love with this woman.
What about me?
Its not easy.
What?!
Did she say why?
Five minutes. What the hell happened here?
You fixed me up with a bald woman.
Oh, yeah, sure, laugh it up. Everybody else did!
(after a moment's thought) Art Vandelay.
My name is George. I'm unemployed and I live with my parents.
See, look at this. (wearing a very tight shirt) Rachel, my T-shirt shrunk. It used to be much bigger, and now it shrunk. You see, that's what water does. It shrinks things.
What are you gonna do with all of them?
Wow! I didn't try that 'til I was 23.
Hey, I brought you some cigarettes. You buy yourself something nice.
You would think that, but either youre born with a sense of humor, or youre not. Its not going to change even if you go from the red sun of Krypton all the way to the yellow sun of the Earth.
Yes I suppose they are.
Good.
(smiling) Well, we're certainly glad that you could make it.
What a mind.
(reading the tabs) Jerry, yours is eleven dollars.
You know -- Elaine.
(Resenting the fact. Nodding) I am aware.
All right, no more lies. Elaine is been chosen to represent the Upper West Side in the next Biosphere project.
Three pints of Kramer's blood?
Funny, cause I happen to be very good friends with Keith Hernandez.
...he embibed her glistening spell...just before the other shoe...fell.
(TALKING IN PASSENGER WINDOW) I didn't mean anything by it. I don't even know L. Ron Hubbard! I didn't know you were...
SEVEN AND FIVE EIGHTHS!!
Me too. I've been yelling at strangers on the street.
Alright, forget Elaine.
Oh, the actress-waitress?
What are those?
He had a TV show! He had cartoons!
Well, I wish I could say the same, but I must say, with all due respect, I find it very hard to see the logic behind some of the moves you have made with this fine organization. In the past twenty years you have caused myself, and the city of New York, a good deal of distress, as we have watched you take our beloved Yankees and reduced them to a laughing stock, all for the glorification of your massive ego!
Jon Voight?
Don't worry, don't worry, no scenes.
Right, can we go? Cause Im double-parked, Im gonna get a ticket.
Ya, sure sure.
Uh, excuse me. Uh, pound of Arabian mocha java, please.
Hey, at least I'm bringing something to this. (Starts flipping through envelopes, reads one ) "Have you seen me?" (Flicks it aside) Nope. (looks at next envelope) Woah, something from Whatley.
Hurry up.
That's it. This is it. I'm done. Through. It's over. I'm gone. Finished. Over. I will never work for you again. Look at you. (laughing) You think you're an important man? Is that what you think? You are a laughingstock. You are a joke. These people are laughing at you. You're nothing! You have no brains, no ability, nothing! (knocking object over on desk) I quit!
Well if she can't tell "six" from "sex" then how is she going to lip read from across the room?
So?
[studying his jacket] Oh man! Look at this! I sat in gum. Oh, by the way, you owe me seven fifty.
Aw c'mon, I'm eating here.
I still don't see why you wouldn't eat me. I'm your best friend.
Please give it to me. I love to help people. This is what I do. Come on. I'm going this way. (he takes the table from Jodi's hands and she has no choice but to follow him)
Well, he said it could be cancer, maybe you should get it checked out.
Quick. Get this thing back in the pizzeria
Oh, great.
You don't understand. A garage. I can't even pull in there. It's like going to a prostitute. Why should I pay, when if I apply myself, maybe I could get it for free? (he hears a horn honking) What? What do you want? Go around me, I'm looking for spaces.
You know what? I could probably do this. Whats the difference.
You've got to start seeing someone else. Get out of this relationship.
I thought tomorrow maybe we'd try a little corn beef.
The Duty Free Shop? Duty Free is the biggest sucker deal in retail. Do you know how much duty is?
Wish I could help you.
Don't look around. Don't look around. That's what he wants.
Pasta primavera! Back on the horse.
Story.
The side?
She's stickin' it to me that she makes more money than me.
I'm starving. We should have had lunch first..
I got rejected by a bald woman. A bald woman rejected me. Heh, you like that one? A woman with no prospects and no *hair*, told me that I wasn't her type. Apparently *baldy* likes a slimmer guy.
(clears his throat)
Oh.
Good. Now get out.
Ill just, uh, get a paper...
Oh, uh, just a friend of mine.
Whatever. Believe me, if I wasn't involved right now, I wouldn't mind being set up. Something tells me she's a knockout. (we see, from the camera inside the cab, George's hand waving as the cab drives away)
Well, go ahead, tell him.
Shake his hand?
Well, I don't see why if you have his, he should have yours.
A backup system? We're designing bathroom doors with our legs exposed in anticipation of the locks not working? That's not a system. That's a complete breakdown of the system.
Marsala?
It's a performance, Jerry. Like what you do.
Yeah. I think we really go something here.
(to various people as he walks in) Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Hi nice to see you. How are you. Good morning. (to the secretary) Good morning.
What actress does she remind you of?
It may have moved, I don't know.
Hi. I-I really should be getting back to my fianc, you know, we, uh, we had this big fight yesterday and, uh, well she, she wants to-to know my secret code. I-I don't know, I can't tell her. The funny thing is, you know, I would really love to tell someone 'cause it's killing me. You uh, you wanna know what it is? It's Bosco. You know, the chocolate syrup? I love that stuff, I pour it in milk, it's my favorite drink. Hoo-hoo, boy, that is a relief!
(to Jerry) He collects them.
Aw, I've just got to say it once, everybody else gets to say it, why can't I say it?
Boom!
I think it moved. Oh my god, I think it moved. Yeah, give me the big piece. I'll see you later.
Next Friday, what time?
I think those are my socks!
OH!!!! What are you, crazy?! Are you, crazy?!
I am aware. I am aware.
Got her machine. Im dead, Im a dead man. Thats it. Im dead, Im a dead man. Dead man.
So you feel okay?
Uh, I'm just selling some of Dad's things, (looking into Kramer's eyes) that's what he would have wanted.
Well, I didn't mean to hurt you kid.
Alright, just make sure he reserves the good chair for me. Wait, what are you gonna tell him about the clanking noise in the car?
I don't know....hmmm ha! here's the doctor.
It's George.
(smitten) Audrey? My god, you look incredible! I can't believe it!
It's my father's car!
You have no idea how refreshing that is.
It is. I'm just not ready yet.
But this is Pavarotti!
He's right! It's the same thing with the femenists. You know, they want everything to be equal, everything! But when the check comes, where are they?
(Angry) Yeah, that's what they told me the last time.
(To the store owner) Excuse me, what do you think of these?
Oh, this is fabulous. My God Elaine, you have to taste this.
So, you... you say you've been in the city all winter?
Well, it frees me up. No encumbrances.
Well, I'm here. What is it?
(MUMBLING) You come to a parking lot, you write it down. How hard is that?
yeah
You know, all these years, I've always wanted to see the two of you get back together.
So you slept with her?
All right, shmoopies...what's it gonna be? Pick a theater.
Well why don't you get a hold of it and change what you don't like.
All right, so what did they do?
Hey.
Ok, what did you say?
Im not?
Well, sometimes you can't help these people 'til they hit rock bottom.
Yeah. Yeah. It's the only way. Come on. What are you, kidding me?
All right, look--wait--wait--Krama--wait, wait a minute, you are not. You are not goin' in. Ah-ahhh!
Huckleberry, Raspberry...
The... drivel... parts. Oh my gosh, I just realized  I have to make a phone call. I-I cant believe- Would you-
You know Keith, what I've always wondered, with all these ball clubs flying around all season don't you think there would be a plane crash? ...
Oh, there's better, (pointing at the row in front of them) right there, that's better.
What's with the dog?
That's amazing.
Yeah, yeah. Speaking of crazy, did you hear about Lloyd Braun?
(shouted after Elaine) You know, I got nothing outta this!
(feigning happiness) The second I see him.
Yes, yes. Very smooth, super smooth. No, but I really wanna attack this thing, you know. Sink my teeth into it. So I was just wondering... what do you think would be the very best way to get started?
Im okay. Im fine. Im wonderful. I never felt better in my whole life.
Why shouldn't I?
No, I dont care.
I spilled some Chardonnay. So, what did you get?
You know, sometimes those guys don't make it back. (Looks in fridge) I'm really hungry.
Hm. Thanks.
you better be careful on those rocks tomorrow buddy. And you're not getting any sandwiches either
As a suspect in a serial killing.
Diane DeConn? You saw Diane DeConn!
Alright, just forget it.
All right, all right ( Goes to the bathroom)
They were drinking champaign in a buggy!
She stayed over?
Listen I was talking to Elaine today and she said she'd would really like to be an usher at the wedding
(taking the phone from Elaine) Jerry, why is Elaine getting your mail?
That?s not the issue, we're friends, if I?ve got to be uncomfortable, you've got to be uncomfortable too!
Here we go.
Step-skipper. That man is a step-skipper! He skips Step Nine!
(dramatically) A what?
Come on, itll be so much easier.
There's a bag of Pepperidge Farm cookies up there.
I got about fifty-feet out and suddenly, the great beast appeared before me. I tell ya he was ten stories high if he was a foot. As if sensing my presence he let out a great bellow. I said, "Easy big fella!" And then, as I watched him struggling I realized, that something was obstructing its breathing. From where I was standing I could see directly into the eye of the great fish!
I never heard of that.
(doing the voice) Not at all.
A knife?
Oh. I know they have some monies.
Abort! Abort!
(seeing Elaine and Puddy come into Monk's) Yeah. Hey, Lainie, Puddy.
You gotta look at this. I pulled it in perfectly equidistant from the car in front of me and the car behind me.
All right. (throws his coat back down on the seat and sits down opposite them)
Yep, this one for our side!
What $98.00?
Get out of the car!
Well, I'm sure they'll be able to fix it. You can't stop modern science. Can't stop it, you can't stop it. Can't stop science. Can't be stopped, no way, no how, science just marches--
Wa..Wait.Wait!......Who is this woman?
Timberlands. (Showing Elaine his boots)
He's actually doing him a favor. It's less money for him to buy food.
Hey.
uh-uh. What's with the bucket?
You know, a muffin can be very filling.
Ya-hah.
Oh, okay. (Starts to walk other way and then walks to their room and goes in)
No, No! She's going out with a friend of mine. It's only courteous that we should try and like each other.
I still have it. The collar's okay. I wear it under sweaters.
I-I don't know. Last time I got the tap.
Yeah, two for the 715 of Novaj pravas (?). What you're wearing the green sweater?
Good, good day. How was your day?
For what?
So let me ask you a question about the tip jar. I had a little thing with the calzone guy this week. I go to drop a buck in the tip jar and just as I am about to drop it in he looks the other way. And then when I am leaving he gives me this look think thanks for nothing. I mean if they don't notice it what's the point.
It's like Im thinking of something, and you're (snaps fingers) one step ahead of me.
I'm writing.
Lunch is fine at the beginning then you move on to dinner. you don't move back to lunch. It's like being demoted. I'll never do another crossword puzzle with her again. I know it.
Just nice?
Just because a candy bar fails to fall from its perch
Right.
And how does the baldness fit into that plan?
Well say were frightened and we have to go home.
I like it!
Wait a minute, please--
...pianist. A *classical* pianist. She *plays* the piano. She's a *brilliant* woman. I-I-I sat in her living room... She played the *Waldstein Sonata*! The *Waldstein*!
Yeah, don't worry. He can afford it.
Wait a second. (George gets up and heads for the statue in Kramers hands.) I cant believe this! Let me see this.
Yup.
So? For a twenty-five dollar cleaning, I can listen to some pointless blather.
You might want to try it...makes the movie more enjoyable, that's all.
Isn't that that Bania guy?
Yeah so did I.
Out. (Jerry shakes his head in agreement) Wow. I spend so much time trying to get their clothes off, I never thought of taking mine off. (Jerry nods; George looks at his watch) Alright, Hey come on, get out of here, Dophne gonna be here any minute.
Medical journals!
Uh, yes, actually we-we both do.
That took awhile.
Woody mentioned me? What did he say?
Yeah, yeah. She's seeing this guy, Art Vandelay.
Yes, Im Sorry, it's a new coat. It-it's Gore-Tex.
I tell you, I really don't think so-called relationship humor is what this show is all about.
All right Bubble Boy. Let's just play... Who invaded Spain in the 8th century?
...And exporter.
Oh, sure. (Holds the box out as Susan takes out a few letters)
(Annoyed) There's more.
Hey, you bastards.
She asked about me? What did- What did she say?
Ya
Can't hurt you.
Well, they're more than an underwear to me Mr. Farkus. Two cups in the front, two loops in the back. How do they do it?
He has no home. He's a squirrel.
All right, so are you ready, so we'll go out and get something to eat.
Yeah?
(claps all happy) AH! (half hugs Estelle)
Mick Jagger.
Yeah, huh.
(talking on the phone) Jerry you gotta bring me some clothes down here. I lost my job with the Yankees. I'm standing in the men's room on 43rd street in my underpants.
She had an itch. She could have used any one of those fingers. That finger was meant for me.
Come on. Ya wanna go get some lunch?
Why am I a marine biologist?
Kramer, listen to me. I'm never gonna have a child. If I lose this Frogger high score, that's it for me.
Hey! (heads toward bathroom)
They don't need any water, so you don't have to keep taking them to the bathroom.
No.
If you go now, I know what's gonna happen. We'll find the car, Jerry will show up, and then we'll never find you.
(cheerful) Alright, there you go. She's gonna get the jacket back. (claps hands) So, let's go get some coffee, huh?
He knows this guy, Wilkinson. He made a fortune in the stock market. Now hes got some new thing. You know, theres supposed to be a big merger. He wasnt even supposed to say anything. You guys should think about doing this too.
Yeah, I'm gonna get a paper.
You had to hop! You had to hop on the plane.
Uh, le - let's go do, something.
I didn't do it! It..It just got done. I don't know how it got done, but it did.
Well, you know, I shouldn't have let you into Kramer's, now you want to go into Elaine's...she entrusted me with her spare keys, how can I just let you in?
Come on! Come-on.
We're gonna hang around here a little while....something funny going on here
I'm very disappointed to here you talk like that. You still don't know what makes me tick.
We could build a cabin like (Snaps) that.
Time?
Drakes?
Oh, that's nice.
Yeah. I had a great time.
She wants to keep it quiet. She... thinks we have a real future together.
I'm not paying $500 for this! It's a piece of junk!
What if her experience with me *drove* her to it?
A pig-man?
If I see things as they are, I would ask 'why' or 'why not?'
Yeah. I'm Buck Naked.
Yeah, yeah.
I am in and out of my personnel file at work all the time.
(hesitates) ...Nooooooooooo...
No, not really. I'm just saying this to you because I like to hear myself talk. Yes, really!
Well, what about the open-lipped kiss?
You know, they say ostrich has less fat, but you eat more of it.
I got engaged. I'm getting married. I asked Susan to marry me. We're getting married this Christmas.
Hello.
Were aware of the proximity to the park, yes.
Cancer? Is it cancer? Do I have cancer?
(using the phone) Watch how it's done. Oh, hello, Mr. Vandelay? Would you like to buy a computer? Oh, really? Two dozen?
Everybody's doing something, we'll do nothing.
I'm back in business, baby!
Elaine, when a woman makes a Ball Entrance.. she twirls.
Why? Did she say something to you about why she broke up with me?
And I have to go. If I don't go, he'll know I'm lying.
What clothes?
Do you have something a little more... less expensive?
(Slowly shakes his head) My mother caught me.
I mean , when I said Hello did she say Hello back?
Yeah.
I-I guess it can't hurt him... People eat *pounds* of those things.
Why?
Really?
What do you mean?
You tellin' 'em about the butler story? Is that beautiful or what? Hey, sorry I'm late. (Looks at Rita) Russell?
What do we have in the fruit department?
I know I gave it to you.
Who's dressing you? (Laughs) You look like a complete idiot! You know, I wouldn't wipe my- (Unable to take anymore, Leslie gets up and shoves George violently. His hands go straight for the hot iron sitting on the dressing room table. George screams out in agony) AAHHHH!!!!! (his voice is heard outside the building, on the street, and in the park were a bunch of pigeons are scared by the yelling)
Yeah.. They made me sick.
I'm Cartwright!
Hello.
Absolutely, uh, lets see there's, uh, Vandelay Industries, I just saw them. I got very close there. very close.
(spits out mouthful of food) Mrs. Enright! Mrs. Enright!
(Losing it) Don't tell me how to eat!
(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o. (Hes sitting on the floor in his Play Now office).
All right, come on, come on, let's go. Six dollars.
On-the-street cell-phone call is the lowest phone call you can make.
Exactly, you know what I'm talking about, right?
(signs) Sorry. (expectant) You're sure, uh, there isn't anything else?
I need like a bucket of water! I got a car overheating, I got an alarm that won't go off, I'm pressing 'one', I'm pressing 'two', nothing! What do I do?! Help me! Help me!
Is Ted Danson's deal standard?
Um, excuse me, I think you forgot my bread.
(bursting out of the bathroom, fumbling with his fly) Button fly! Why do they put buttons on a fly? It takes ten minutes to get these things open!
Yes. Well -- So, uh, sit on the same side at a booth, huh?
Ohh, hey there, young fella. (They shake hands) What's your major?
Ok, ok, fine! It's changed, it's not really the point. Anyway, I'm thinking of making a big move.
(taking it out of his jacket pocket) yeah I got some sandwiches.. I got tuna.. and salmon salad Tony because I know you don't like peanut butter
I love it. New office, new salary. I'm the new Wilhelm.
He'd just be touching your back too.
I cant. I met them. Theyre devout. You know, in the cab on the way over here, I actually thought about converting.
...Are you sure?
You put a hot tub... in your living room?
I don't wanna tell you how to run your show.
Actually, (George flips the book back to the beginning) I'll take these nice glossy ones.
You like that?
I did?
I don't understand, how do these thieves start the car?
D'oh...Oh, oh, the judge! I hate this guy!
Aw, she's gonna be a fine sailor.
Hey, so get this. I get a call this morning from one of the Mets front office guys. They wanna take me out to lunch.
When do you ever have ten car lengths?
Heads!
Ohh.. Paco! (Flicks rubber band tward the kitchen) Hey, take a look at this. (Hands Jerry Kruger's check)
Hey, hey, let's not get so defensive here. This is a give and take process.
Not a plane crash. (leaving) Is it a plane crash?
I went to look in the mirror, it wasn't there. You threw off my equilibrium.
I can't run, I have a bad hamstring.
Maura. (starts acting dramatically, looking from Maura to Loretta and back again) Oh, my God! What are you doing here?!
Joe DiMaggio.
I know....
They're breaking up? How do you know?
Natalie?
Lupe. That's very nice, very nice. Listen, are you going to be making up the bed in the morning?
Cut it.
How ya doin'?
Oh yeah. So wait, wait. A half-hour later Im back in the office, I tell Lloyd the whole story. He says, So why dont you call her? I says, I cant. I couldnt, I couldnt do it right then. For me to ask a woman out I gotta get into a mental state like the karate guys before they break the bricks. So Lloyd calls me a wuss.
Listen, you're lucking I'm not asking for a whole refund. (trying to speak quietly) You gave me ladies' frames!
What if it rains?
I am not buying something just to get change.
I really think I should have been consulted about this.
Sure, all right, what do you want?
Remember, dont take any crap.
Well, it comes and goes.
You know, it's very impolite to tell secrets. Are you talking about me?
Oh yeah, everybodys guy is the best.
Well, is he good, Kramer?
I dunno sometimes...
What happened to your voice?
I need some water. I gotta get some water.
Well, as I say, the pink-eye made my vision...quite blurry... (Joe's daughter comes to the door.)
For 50 bucks? I'd put my face in the soup and blow.
(to himself, resentful) What kind of a snobby, stuck-up, cult is this?!
Robin, listen to me. The most amazing thing has happened. Kramer has opened my eyes. I think I've changed.
(playing it cool) I'm still here.
The movies. Blimp is playing right there.
Eh, don't mention it.
Hi Allison, thats a nice dress.
(through a mouthful) Long as they don't throw 'em on the field. (laughs) Huhu. (indicating dish) Help yourself to some shrimp, I brought enough for everybody.
So, they knew? Those liars!
See, didn't bother Susan either. That's why I'm different. I can sense the slightest human suffering.
Head start, oh no absolutely not.
Hey di ho
Jerry! Up here!
All right. All right! I'll go.
Why don't they have salsa on the table?
I don't understand. They're supposed to be casting this week. Something's wrong. Maybe they're not doing it.
Sir, I just got a call from the terrorist. I told him to call back here.
I'll bet you, how much?
Hey, check this out. I gotta give out Christmas presents to everyone down at Kruger, so I'm pulling a Whatley. (Give a Christmas card to Jerry)
No.
No harm!
I dont know. All of em. Theyre all crooks! Besides, I couldnt get all different candy bars, anyway.
I have no power Do you understand? I need hand. I have no hand.
Elaine, what are you doing?
Yeah, sure. I was showing a condo on 48th street. Besides, you think I wanna miss this? (chuckles)
(angry shout) So am I!
Oh.
No no no no no no no..
(Leading Nina out the airport) Oh, no. No. We're good. Let's get goin'. Alright. (Almost bumps into Jerry) Watch it, funny man. (Leaves)
It's not that easy. It's like "Beat The Clock," there's a lot of pressure there.
Deena! Deena, wait a... Deena, help!
All right here you go.
Huh?
Yes, sir.
Well...
God, you're like a rock star.
Never mind. The're done. All I have to do now is redo them. You know if you take everything I've ever done in my entire life and condense it down into one day, it looks decent.
What?
It's about the show. It... No, it was...
Brother Costanza will be taking the vow of silence.
Ooh ho hoo, forget it.
(confused) What does that mean?
I'm going out with her tomorrow, she said she had some errands to run.
Listen Jerry. With all due respect, Bania's voice is the voice of a new generation. My generation.
Yes, well, you know, Im not thinking about the price. You know youre the only woman Ive never thought about the price. Get the lobster. I beg you to get the lobster. Go for the lobster.
I don't know what you're getting all riled up about. There are probably a million Costanzas-
No.
No.
Know him? Would you, uh, like to meet him?
Elaine, I'm, I'm shocked. I'm shocked. Here I go out in the spirit of the season (Elaine looking like she's not buying a word of it) and spend all my savings to buy you the most beautiful Christmas sweater I have ever seen to show my appreciation to you at Christmas and this is the thanks that I get at Christmas.
Yeah, I got one too.
Fantastic?
I loved her Jerry, I loved her.
(Looks at her) Yeah, uh, no menus. (Waves her off)
(Nods) Uh-huh.
Yeah-hah!
Hup! Hup!
I mean, how funny is this?
Oh! no no nothing....
Did you see the homeless guy on the library steps screaming obsenities and doing some calesthetics routine
Hey!.. What can I tell ya.
Nothing...little problem.
I don't know. A little thing called Step Nine? Instead of an apology, he was beboppin' and scattin' all over me.
I-I-I-I-I got it!!!!!
What?!
Really? I thought you liked her.
I love these people, you can't ask 'em questions. (getting excited) They're so mentally gifted that we mustn't disturb the delicate genius unless it's in the confines of an office. (worked up) When huge sums of money are involved, then the delicate genius can be disturbed!
All right. Don't change me. Susan. Don't change me. Ya know there are a lot of woman that would love to be in your position right now.
Elaine.
Look at me! I am man! I am you!
See her tonight. See her tomorrow. Go. Knock yourself out. Shes too crazy for me.
Aw c'mon. It's a fantastic name. It's a real original, nobody else is gonna have it and I absolutely love it.
I don't have a job!
She's not faking!
So why didn't you tell me?
Well, you know, to be honest sir -- my, my new secretary Ade, came up with that one.
You know that coat was Gore-Tex. Its worth a hell of a lot more than that, cheap Chardonnay.
Hand sandwich.
Yeah, it's me, I just got home.
Blimp The Hindenburg Story.
It's break up by association. Besides, she's mad at me anyway because of my birthday present.
Maybe I'll go down to the track. Put it all on a horse...
(gesturing with flyer) With Spartacus?
(waving Eva.
The Bubble Boy!
So, uh, how long has this been going on?
What's with this guy?
Come on! Come on!
They would never tell me, Elaine. First of all, they probably think that I killed Susan. Besides, I don't even think they like me. (Jerry comes over to the table.)
Hey, Elaine.
Look I need you to do me a favor. I need you to get me lunch at Pisano's.
So now you're doing my bits?
So, he's keeping the apartment. He doesn't deserve it, though! Even if he did suffer, that was, like, 40 years ago! What has he been doing lately?! I've been suffering for the past 30 years up to and including yesterday!
Hey, a "hit" is a totally different story.
George is going to the movies! (exits)
ahh.....!!
Can you believe that guy?
(jubilant) Five thousand dollars? She doesnt have five thousand dollars!
The Day..
It's the same movie! What's the difference?
ahhhhh (exhaling) Jerry, my young friend, you're so nave. You are so, so nave. You know about a few things. You know about comedy, a little bit about relationships, some baseball, but you are so far out of your element here, you are embarrassing yourself. Now listen to me. I'm negotiating. Negotiation, this is what'cha do in business.
All right Superman's the exception.
Nothing!
(shouts) Of course there's something wrong! (points at Jerry) We had a pact!
Kramer. Anything good in there? Any Popsicles?
The prop comic? (Ronnie holds up his water gun and smiles.) Oh, hi...I didn't recognize you, what...did you get a haircut?
Well I was dropping of the calzone money for the week.... Um shouldn't you be at work by now?
No no no, he's not getting away with this.
You shook my hand in that coffee shop.
Well, you really did it to me this time, Seinfeld. . . . What the hell happened here?
Aretha! (points finger at Jerry)
A ha! We're just friends.
What do you want?
You only went in front first 'cause you saw me backing up and you didn't have room to parallel park!
Maybe a black.
Do I smell?
Hey hey.
What? No dibs! I need this statue. Cmon, give it!
Tsst...'Course I have. Come on. My cousin's in a bubble. My friend Jeffrey's uh, sister, also ... bubble ... you know. I got a lot of bubble experience. Come on.
Dollar Eighty-Nine. Why is this a dollar eighty-nine? Why is there no haggling in this country?
I'm gonna read a book. From beginning to end. In that order.
Yeah. Steinbrenner wants everyone in the front office to give a lecture in their area of business expertise.
They were, it's kinda complicated.
Of course I'm all right. I'm here with my girl, Nina. And what better way to pass the time than gabbing with my best friend -- with whom there are no secrets. (Flashes two intertwined fingers) Like this. Since the fourth grade.
You're parents saw me on TV?
Oh, sure. Of course. (looks for place to set down flowers) Um, uh, could you hold these? For just a second, just a second. (grabs newspapers from trash bin, begins wiping windshield) Here you go, now don't worry about a thing. It's gonna be fine. Here we go. Look at this shine.
I'll pay you for your time....I just ..I just need some information . How much do you want? ten....fifteen? You have change for twenty?
Please, it's--
Yeah?
That's exactly what I'm trying to avoid!
Come on!
(taking out wallet) Well, let me. Heh. Let me just eh.. check an', make sure I have the right man--ha! Heh, heh, heh! Seems--oh! I, oh! (has conveniently dropped the photo into her view)
People who do that should be arrested.
Thanks a lot. I'm really late. My parents are waiting in front of my building and we're stuck here.
'Maybe you know some little places to go, where they never close...'
What? Did you get the busboy's number?
You're soured?
I'm sorry, uh, it's not like I'm gonna see something I've never seen before.
What did you do?
Alright, alright! (Goes out onto the sidewalk. The Seinfelds walk by) Seinfelds!
What were you saying to the Rosses over there, anyway?
Roll up your sleeve.
She wasn't flirting with you.
Mmm.
Is there any work being done? Is there any rubbing, touching, finger manipulation on the other person, and if so, who's making the request?
Sweep?
What's casus belli.
(laughs) hu hu.
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I used to come here all the time with my fiance, back when it was a meat-packing plant. Ha. Here's her picture. (hands her a magazine page)
I'll tell you what. Why don't we just get a couple of dishes and we'll just share 'em.
Are you kidding? I lie every second of the day. My whole life is a sham!
It's...gotta hurt! Hurt! Because...Aaarrrrrgh!
(clears his throat) Im, uh, Im an architect.
(To himself) Oh my God.
I don't even like to use urinals, always been a stall man.
It won't for a while. At least not until after the cast comes off.
Yeah, I'm gonna let it go.
Morning Thunder has caffeine in it, Jerry doesn't drink caffeine.
And you're watching the fight at Jerry's?
Oh, nothing...
Because my parents happen to be two pretty wonderful people.
All right. So, you hold out your money, speak your soup in a loud, clear voice, step to the left and receive.
I dunno they said maybe.
What?
You wouldnt believe it. Rasputin.
Uh, C-R-E-S-P-I?
Hmm. What about a hole? You ever put anybody in "the box"?
No.
Oh, no. No stories.
Ha Haaaaaaa... Jerry how do you like that.You see I get myself in a dizzy, I'm all worked up and for what?
Oh, no no no, I'm fine. Let me help you with these dishes, huh?
Me?
Have you ever seen a Schnitzer's rye? It - it's huge!
Thanks again.
After consummation.
I want your honest opinion about something.
I still have brill cream.
Right.
My code?
Why didn't she tell us?
(pointing to Jerry in joyous agreement) Ha-ha-hah. This is my lucky day.
I'm bootleggin' a movie, baby!
You know, that, that thing about her being too good for him. I mean, I was just bein' folksy. They could tell I was just being folksy..?
Just a little something for Christmas.
Or we could get them together. Woo!
A table right here.
Are you crazy? This is like discovering Plutonium ... by accident.
Then... shouldn't you be wearing the bucket.
Boy, these are really bad details.
Hey...you don't think...sure, that's Jon Voight's pencil!
Five' eight! Five' seven!
Where's the luck? There's no luck. 1,900 dollars down the drain.
Nobody tucks anymore.
Hm?
How nice?
Anyway.
Well, losing a loved is, uh...I mean, forget about it. (Starts wolfing down the sandwiches.)
Sure. So, uh, Jerry, there's an empty apartment in my building. If you and Hallie want, we could try and hold it, may...
Why did it all turn out like this for me? I had so much promise. I was personable, I was bright. (Elaine turns showing disagreement) Oh, maybe not academically speaking, (Elaine nods correct) I was perceptive. I always know when someone's uncomfortable at a party.
Could anybody do that?
Yeah? Well, I had sex with your wife.
Maybe the baby would like to see my spot. A positive, uplifting message to start his life out with. Huh, You can still get a great space in this city - if you apply yourself.
(pointing to himself) Like me?
Students cant clean. Its anathema. (explaining) They dont like it.
(animated) Fixed up? A cup of coffee! A cup of coffee is not a fix up!
Hey, what are you doing tonight?
I mean, batteries have gone dead before, aren't they prepared for that?
And here's a roll that I think you may enjoy.
(disbelief) What?! They're stealing the name?! That's my name, I made it up!
She got that from you!
(Confused) What photo?
The New York Yankees!
What are you talking about? How can you sit there and look me in the eye and tell that me you're not worried?! Don't you have any *sense*?!! Don't you have a brain!? Are you so completely senile that you don't know what you're talkin about Anymore!!?!
I don't have a spare set. All my keys say 'do not duplicate'.
"No I didn't"
That I'm used to. (he leaves)
That's right...We just had sex......You know Jerry I've been searching for someone a long time. Well the search is over.
Why don't you give me the twenty, and I'll stop and get change, and then you and I can... uh... you-know, settle.
What choice do I have?
It's a joke.
You see, my friend here, his aunt passed away last night.
One mile from the exit it starts shaking, really violently shaking, like it's having a nervous breakdown. It completely stopped dead.
Ya it used to be right in the middle of single Jeopardy and now they do it right after single Jeopardy.
What are they gonna do?
(delighted!) Woooo!
(on the phone) Oh my God.
Why don't you just commit yourself already?
Pounded?
Was it my fault?
Beautiful lineswoman. Alright listen uh I'm going to go to the concession stand and get some real sunblock. You want anything? Jerry? (Jerry is staring at the lineswoman) Jerry?
Chamomile's good. Lemon Lift. Almond Pleasure.
No, I'm not. I would like to be, but I'm not. What am I gonna do? The book club meets in a few days.
Yes, she wants me to like her, if she likes me. But she doesnt like me!
"The hell with them?"
(Motioning toward waitress) I think she likes me.
Name tags! Name tags! What kind of an idiot thinks anybody would be interested in an idea like that.
Now everyone's going to think we're gay!
I can't believe what's happening here. She hasn't taken her hands off me all night. She was always friendly around the office, but that was it.
Of course I'm not Cartwright! Look, why don't you two just go to the movies all by yourselves, I'm not in the mood.
Rid? Nah, c'mon, the word is 'care'. Care. I care about your comfort, be it here in Queens or twelve-hundred miles away.
Oh, no, not just me, the whole organization. Especially Mr. Morgan.
Let me just see it for a second.
"Quite a workout"? What did you say?
(shrugs and lights it up)
Oh, yeah. Downtown. Definitely.
I had the perfect situation here, he was shouldering half the load.
Oh you can stuff your sorries in a sack, Mister!
I'm going straight to hell, no two ways about it.
Cosmo
Yeah, just like I do.
(pauses to consider this then gives in) All right. (starts heading towards bedroom)
Five-thousand? Why would anybody buy Kramer for $5000? (laughs)
No I didn't mean to imply that you did. You're obviously a very well proportioned individual. I was just wondering, have they ever offered you a chair?
Nothing.
Wednesday? That's your personal business?! (stalks over to the counter) Skiing?! (angry) So let people suffer, while you're shushing all over a mountain?
Mmm-mm.
You know, I think I could have played with dolls if their were dolls in the house. It seems like fun to me. It doesn't seem like a gender thing. I think I would like to play with dolls. What's so terrible?
Elaine! (shouts) ELAINE!!
What?
(Jerry-style) That's a shame.
Woo! Courtside! (mock-snide) Is that the best you could do? Ha ha!
Yeah, I saw it.
Oh yeah.
Big screen TV?
This is fantastic. Man, what a weekend. Swimming, lobster for dinner...
Ho, ho, ho! Hes got a live one. Hes just reeling his big fish in!
Nah, the cable's out. What's with you? You look dead.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Chunnel . Susan!
Flying him in? How longs he staying for?
He can't not be funny.
Pass the salt please.
I can do six weeks standin' on my head. I'm a sexual camel. That's not the point. At least there was the possibility.
Jerry. Jerry.
Oh, you hesitated.
I know, but he's your son.
What is that with the shmoopy?
I got up, I was supposed to go to work, I came here instead.
So, where you gonna stick this (points to the Fusilli Jerry)
You know, I cant believe youre bringin in an extra bed for woman that wants to sleep with you. Why dont you bring in an extra guy too?
Uh, I just went out, I went to look for my friend?
(Takes two oven mitts from his back pack) Alright, (puts them on) I gotta get going.
'When you're alone, and life is making you lonely, you can always go...'
Okay. Now, why do I have to see (points) you?
He purposely mispronounced my name. Instead of saying, "Costanza" He'd say, "Can't stand ja". "Can't stand ja" ... He made me smell my own gym socks once.
I'm gonna hit the head.
It's Susan
Say? What? Nothing, I...
(leaving) That'll do.
You don't need the cufflinks! You have the same name! (no reaction) 'Jerry'! (heads for door, grabbing his coat)
Um, excuse me, have you see a guy with like a horse face, big teeth, and a, and a pointed nose?
Well I don't think she is a multiple sneezer, because she sneezed again later, and it was also a single.
Why does she want you to be mad?
Watch the arm! Tim, listen, we don't want to bother you, we know you're busy here.
When are they leaving for Paris?
Because she asked me to.
Who?
We go into NBC.
I snapped! It was the last straw. (sighs)
What do you mean? The engagement is off, we get the TV back. That's business.
No, no no. That skips a generation. The baldness gene comes from your grandfather.
(Wanting Elaine to take it off his hands, he tries to silence Jerry) Jerry, simmer down.
Well, what happened when you got upstairs?
Wa.. He doesn't have to tell her.
(Annoyed) Frog is wrong.
Could you make it two-twenty-five that was his hi-game in bowling.
Did she say Hello?
What happened to your itch?
Maybe you don't have to be so funny. I mean, would it kill you not to be so funny all the time? That's all I'm asking. This woman thinks I'm very funny. Now you're gonna be funny, so what am I gonna be? I'm gonna be a short bald guy with glasses who suddenly doesn't seem so funny.
(insincerely) Ahh, hey you're home. Hi.
Early! Alright! (shivers.) Cold.
(admiring himself in mirror) I did.
Yes, positive.
I don't even think she'd notice it. Can you see it?
All right. Let's go over it again, one more time.
(to Jerry) Hey.
Oh Shut up! What are you doing back so soon, anyway? (puts the tape back in it's case.)
Good thinking!
Well, that's really not fair.
I got nothing.
I think she finds my stupidity charming.
What happened to the pact? We were both gonna change. We shook hands on a pact. Did you not shake my hand on it uh?
They are?
Moths?
Did I get him in trouble? Because of what I said?! I just told him what happened.. he didn't do it on purpose.. (Mangager and busboy are arguing. The busboy points in the direction of George) He pointed at me. Why did he point at me?!
(singing; imitating Tony Bennett) You know, Id go from nods to nothing...
He scratches off a 32 and he puts in 31.
(to Kramer) Ah! You're just the man I'm looking for.
What do you think about a rocking chair?
Yeah, yeah.
Here ... something.
Really...(he honks the car and is startled, Elaine laughs)......I have to say...You were really good doing that porno thing....you're talented.
Listen, I gotta ask you I was a little concerned that perhaps I was responsible in some way for your, uh... metamorphosis.
(excited) Yeah, the pilot!
Yeah. see you later.
Shocked?
A... ah...
(To Elaine) Told me the same thing.
How do I know, maybe, you know, maybe she wanted to be polite.
Anyway, so he gave me his spare keys, now he wants to have my keys, so I need mine back from you.
She asked me to.
Um, hi, its George, George Costanza, remember me? The guy that didnt come up for coffee. You see, I didnt realise that coffee didnt really mean... well, whatever. Anyway, it was fun. It was... it was fun, so... oh boy, um, so... You call me back. If you want. Its up to you, you know, whatever you wanna do. Either way. The balls in your court. So uh, take it easy.
(stands up) I am.
What, are you kidding? (Points at the flaws of Jerry's hands) The knuckles are all out of proportion. you got hair over there - where do you get off comparing your hands to my hands?! This is a one-in-a-million hand. (Points to his own hand)
I am not putting it in a garage, it's my space.
All right. That's more like it. Thank you very much. (giving the sponsor the 'be strong' hand clench) By the way, my uncle was an alcoholic, so...
(wondering) Maybe he doesn't. Maybe he and I are exactly the same, except for one minor, yet crucial, detail. You never know.
I got a message from the Rosses at work today.
Nope!
Signal? What signal?
Mr Reichman?
Oh... (George looks around and sees the chef hiding behind a plant it's Bob!)
You shouldn't have tucked.
I don't know. I closed my eyes and made a move.
Wait, have you ever seen him throw up?!
Not as thin as you think.
Clara Barton? What did she do?
I'm in line to buy.
I've gotta go to the bathroom.
Well, all vacations have to end eventually.
Ewings hurt? How long is he going to be out?
I know. I cut the button off and poked a hole with a letter opener.
He..hmmm. humm...What about this one.
Who would Want to. She tried to end it with me, Jerry.
Yes, I know so. You happen to be a very eligible lesbian.
(really animated) Alright, alright. You see? This is why I hate writing with a large group. Everybody has their own little opinions, and it all gets homogenised, and you lose the whole edge of it. I'm going with jerk store! Jerk store is the line! Jerk store! Yess!
What?
"Sir?"
I'm a bad man!
Prognosis Negative! (in a funny voice)
What?
Oh are they gonna be furious.
I'll tell you something, if I'd own a company, my employees would love me. They'd have huge pictures of me up on the walls and in their home, like Lenin.
Cut it. (goes back to the group) (Yelling) Would you stop signing?
So you thought she was good looking and figured this would be a good way to meet her.
Not necessarily.
Me either. Is there anything you can do to shut them up?
Huh-ho! Oh! You are too much, Mr. Kruger! Too much!
Yeah.
Well where is she?
I've got nothing, I-I-I-I'm blank.
Lloyd Braun? What d'you have to meet him for?
We just go up to him, we say, "We're O'Brien."
I think something's happening here.
(dryly) You're on that list.
Uh, Mr Wilhelm.
Look at that. They got lobster on the menu. Who would order a lobster here. I mean, do they bring a lobster in everyday hoping *todays* the day.
Oh, this is unbelievable. I'm stuck. Every time I think I'm out, they pull me back in.
Whoa, whoa, a section?!
What are you comparing yourself to Keith Hernandez. The guys a baseball player Jerry, Baseball!
Food was good.
Or, I could take the twenty, then I could pay *you* later.
Ya know, I was just a little surprised.
What the hell is a gander, anyway?
No forget the story.
All right, relax, tough guy. I got to go out to my father's garage, help him sell some computers.
Because! Because, as the leader...if I die...then all hope is lost! Who would lead? The clown? Instead of castigating me, you should all be thanking me. What kind of a topsy-turvy world do we live in, where-where heroes are cast as villains? Brave men as cowards?
Very nice
Aw, hoh, oh Deena, thank God. (he hugs Deena) Thank God you're here. Listen, you gotta help me. You gotta tell these people that I'm okay. You know that I don't belong in here.
25? You don't have anything higher?
Yeah. Hey Jerry, listen to this. I discovered something even better than conjugal visit sex. Fugitive sex! Now, it's like everytime -
China.
Let's have it.
Wha?
It's supposed to be a good party.
Don't worry, I got it.
(defensive) So what? So what if I do?
Yeahhh.
You're right. Why must there always be a problem? You'd think just once I could get a break. God knows I earned it with that score!
I got greedy. Flew too close to the sun on wings of pastrami.
I did!
What?
(on phone  calling secretary) Hello Margery, George Costanza. How are you sweet heart? Listen, can you give Mr. Thomassoulo a message for me? Yes. If he needs me, tell him (screams) IM IN MY OFFICE! Thanks.
Pasta primavera.
I can't believe it. Look, that's Jerry Seinfeld.
Hey. I've kept the same job for more than two years. It's not luck. Elaine, have you ever sent a racy photograph of yourself to anyone?
They all have swirling chocolate in the commercial!
What game?
Yeah, fun. IQ tests are totally bogus. They prove nothing.
Pasta primavera?
Who?
He probably doesn't want to get chocolate on his fingers. That's the way these society types eat their candy bars.
Yeah, I think, you know, she was, like, crying, and he was consoling her, and then, she, uh, just got into his car, and they just drove away.
Come on. Come check out my new place. It'll take you two minutes.
All right. So let me ask you a question. Who was the man in the cape?
I know. I can tell. It's one of my powers. Why, did you ever fake?
In six games.
That's where the electricity comes out.
(slightly worried) You know, I'm starting to get a little nervous about this lunch.
Alright. I guess I just have to pick myself up, dust myself off, and throw myself right back down again!
We need to talk.
It's not contest. The guy had nothing! The ship went down, he got into a life boat, I mean, come on.
All right, but we're not buyin' it at Bloomingdale's. I will buy it, you pay me back later. I'll sniff out a deal. I have a sixth sense.
(shouting) How d'you not like Soda?! It's bubbly, it's refreshing!
I am not! What you call wasting, I call living! I'm living my life!
(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o Kramer!
How do you know?
Mom and Pop Seinfeld
No, no she wasn't.
Well, it's all for charity, so what's the difference.
I would? What if something happens?
Yes!
But, but I'm disturbed! I'm depressed! I'm inadequate! I got it all!!
Right! And these pigeons broke the deal. I will not accept the blame for this!
So, the college cancelled the gig?
Maybe I could call my father.
Wait a minute, that is my apartment. I earned it with 34 years of misery!
I'm as good as them.
"Hemmm!.. Fine!"
The name's George Constanza. I'm starting work here today. I was wondering if you could tell me where my office is.
Anyway it's kind of a fluke thing but uh I'll be leaving for Paris in two days. I will send you a postcard when I get there.
Krama. Open up! I--I know you're in there!
I'm out! Fantastic apartment right across from mine, huh. I can't wait for you to see it.
Look it's no secret what's going on between us. (to Jerry) She doesn't like me. Now Jerry if you don't mind.
--Astroturf? You know who's responsible for that, don't you?! The Jews! Ah, the Jews hate grass. They always have, they always will.
Pretentious? Who, who isn't pretentious? Ha, ha, if everyone who was pretentious was in a mental institution, ... uh, obviously THIS isn't a mental institution.
but..why, it wasn't my fault, I .. you asked me a sandwich, I .. I make such delicious sandwiches Elaine
Yeah. See ya.
Alright. 7,7, (points at himself) 6. I'm not gonna eat that much!
I would give anything to be going up those stairs again.
What's that?
Elaine, Julie.
(Places the doll presumingly where it belongs on a shelf) Ya?
Well then, from out of nowhere, a huge tidal wave lifted me, tossed like a cork and I found myself right on top of him, (ELAINE gasps quietly Ahhhh) face to face with the blow-hole. I-I, I could barely see from the waves crashing down upon me but, I knew something was there so I reached my hand in, felt around and pulled out the obstruction!
he's the first cool guy I've ever been friends with in my whole life. You know.. it's a different world when you're with a cool guy, he's not afraid of anybody. You should hear the way he talks to waitresses.. he gets free pie!
"Breakfast At Tiffany's." 90 pages. (Waves a hand like it's nothing.)
It's a big flat noodle.
Well, Jerry. There was a pretty good chance I was never gonna have sex again anyway.
Remember when you came to audition for us?
Well anyway, the, uh... the stone is up, I paid my respects, guess that's it.
That's right, who the hell are they? How dare they?!
(stops Jerry realizing something) Hey hey hey hey hey hey.
Thats why, you know, a shake is bad.
I know it may sound shocking. But, I just can't stop myself from... wanting you.
Well, I think this is it.
(Still with a tone) He is. You dont know what Im doin here.
What? You can't leave yet.
Yes!
Kinda busy here.
Hey.
(smile) Yeah.
No no, this is a matter of principle. That would just be saying that anybody could just pull into any parking space any way they want. Well I'm making a stand here. I'm saying *no* to head first parking. I'm not putting up with that. We put up with too much crap in this city, we're not putting up with head first parking.
What for?
I didn't think you wore them anymore.
Eh, but, you know, Mr. Ross, if - if you look at the whole situating, what with it being your cigars, and everything, it's really rather ironic - one might even say, in a sense, comical.. (Mr. Ross has, by now, left the room. Mrs. Ross is pointing at George, nodding, laughing. As if to say he hit the bullseye. George calls out to Mr. Ross) Really. Think about it.
(to Jerry) Well, what d'you think?
I always look annoyed. Yeah, when you look annoyed all the time, people think that you're busy. Think about it... (acts annoyed for 3 seconds).
Aw, come on. I wanna go see him.
I'm at the health club and while I'm in the pool, some guy walks off with my glasses. Who steals prescription glasses?
Hey!
(answering the phone while walking away) Joe Mayo's apartment?
Apparently the glue in the wedding invitations was a....toxic.
What's that?
Told you.
Yes, she's pretty. What difference does it make?
So, what did she say?
You know, we're living in a society! We're supposed to act in a civilized way.
No...
Care to make it interesting?
What is that? Its ridiculous! You dont even know what hotel shes staying at, you cant call her. Thats a signal, Jerry, thats a signal! (snaps his fingers) Signal!
(Sarcastic) Yeah, yeah. I'm gonna move in with him. He doesn't even let you use the toilet!
Well , not yet.. Fianc.
Uh huh.
Hey, I'm sorry, you had your buffer zone for many years. It's my turn to live, baby.
(back-pedalling) No, he, he didnt actually tell me that, uh, we were talking about that commercial  in fact I think I brought it up because I like that commercial. No, he, he would never tell me anything. He never discusses anything. Hes, hes like a clam. Youre not gonna mention this, to him...
Oh, the nose job. I don't know, what did you think?
Have you ever given your code to anyone?
C'mon, funny is funny.
Did you say dangerous?
If she want's to continue to have a fibre of her being she'll be very careful (hitting each other)
Uh, can we cut to the chase?
(Confused) Flagged?
No! No.
We...must never ever speak of this again..
Ahh! (closes his eyes and rolling his head back) Umh!
Yes, sure, surely was. Yeah, I'll remember that day. Well I'll never forget it because that was the day that I uh, lost my virginity to Miss. Stafford, the uh, voluptuous home room teacher.
Yeah. (Jerry nodding) ... Oh, you think because of what I said about the manure. I wa, wa, was just saying how it takes a negative thing, and puts it on a positive spin on it.
Hey.
Gimme half!
So then what?
HI ELAINE...
Oh Oh, here, lemme uh...
He knows the worlds theory.
(Frantically, takes phone and screams...) He'll call you back.
(pleading) Well, my bed is too small.
This is nice.
(Apprehensively) Um. I just realized. Ya' never gave me back the change from the tolls.
Well you know what happens with larvae hatch, they-they're everywhere.
Oh, that's too bad. I kinda wanted to meet him, seeing as how we look so similar.
(to Jerry, yelling) You told her? She's not your wife!
$2300.
And Elaine is gonna keep him busy.
Now?! I'm a mutant!
(after hesitating, resignedly) All right. (He sits down and smiles unconvincingly at her)
Come on over and sit down.
Let me ask you this. If you stick your hand in the hair is it easy to get it out?
I have to say, as a glasses wearer I take exception to that. That's like me buying a wheelchair to cruise around in.
What are you going to say?
Yeah. One second sweetheart. Jerry, I really think it'd be easier if you didn't tuck.
Is it a clockwise swirl?
W-ca-What did they do?
Me Too! And he's Dying Jerry! If Relationship George walks through this door, he will Kill Independent George! A George, divided against itself, Cannot Stand!
(surprise) Huh. I never heard you say you admire me for anything.
Is she the only girl in the whole world? Why can't you get find your own girl?
I just don't feel like it anymore.
He was definitely sniffing.
Yeah. Where's he taking you, by the way?
Speak now, or we are headed to the Hamptons. It's a two-hour drive. Once you get in that car, we are going all the way... to the Hamptons. All right, you wanna get nuts? Come on. Let's get nuts!
What for?
Yeah, when the season starts. Right now, I sit around pretending that I'm busy.
I was sitting there, c'mon.
How 'bout Kramer.
I wanna go to a tractor pull.
Why d'you think I'm going now?
So, Jerry and Nina, huh?
What does that do?
Yes, I saw that.
I think I can sum up the show for you with one word NOTHING.
....But after that we really talked didn't we?
Did you tell her anything?
Is that the guy who likes fat women?
Get out of here. I didn't see any cameras there.
The way they make 'em these days, I'll never have to tell her.
Oh, wow.
I'm going to the bathroom.
Alright, look, you want to be in?
He left perfect imprints.
(excited) Great news! I showed the pilot to Kramer's Japanese friends. They loved it!
Uh-huh. And how much does the healer charge?
Alright, just keep the hat!
I can't eat this without catsup. Would it kill her to check up on us? Would that be a terrible thing? "How's everything? Do you need anything? What can I do for you?"
Today. Im going today. Just dont do anything until you hear from me.
Yeah, about ten, fifteen minutes. But I have to stop at a vegetable stand.
Well I know how to drive.
This hat just bottles in the heat, I -I don't even need a coat! It's unbelievable!
No, it hit the table, it hit the table.
Alright, let's go.
You're sleepin' with the maid?
No no no no, you have to approach this as if he was a woman.
You think she should have said something?
What's that.
(Slowly backing away, he's not at all committed to the conversation) Yeah.. television.
I don't know.
Hey.
What?
Shut up! Shut up!
You're going to the Tony's?
(enters) Hi.
I had a great time tonight Carrie. And I am going to call you as soon as I get home.
I don't know, about three days.
(worked up) I'm aware! I'm aware!! But this is Marisa Tomei, Elaine. An Oscar winner! How can I live the rest of my life, knowing I coulda been with Marisa Tomei? She said I was just her type! She loves short, stocky, balding funny men!
Yes, as I see it.
I meet this women, Sheila. She works down at the one hour photo pace. She's got this incredible smile. Like she's got extra teeth or something
No, it's doing the same thing to someone that they did to you.
So we'll do it tomorrow.
What?
(eating a pickle) Well they're his tickets, he can do what he wants with them.
I told you.
(Talking about his would-be apartment) You could fit 15 people in that bathroom..
So what's your point?
Could be the leaves...
I'm emotional.
(smiling) Listen, I..I..I don't mean to seem forward...
Hello.
Oh, yeah, sure. Keep your money.
Yeah. (another pause) Not that I care, one way or the other, but these doctors today really do amazing things, you know, if you were so inclined. And again, I'm not suggesting.
Bovary! (points finger again at Jerry)
(annoyed) Hes an importer/exporter, okay? (beat) Elaine ever call you back?
Cosmo
Yeah. Well aparently word's out.
Isn't that the uh, Friars Club jacket?
I gotta call Tatiana. where's the phone?
I'm family. I'm having sex with the cousin!
What are you saying?
Uh, excuse me, are you Joe Temple?
Ah, enjoying them?
They send me? Aw right ..ask 'em Does it really work?
Did you pass your stone yet?
Yes. Significant shrinkage.
Mom? Dad?
Hate those couples. I could never bee one of those couples. There are no bald woman around. You know?
Yeah, well...a little rough finding something good in your price-range. (to Jerry) But you, my friend, may be in luck.
You're telling me. (he walks around and the suit makes a swooshing sound) So, what do you think?
Because we brought it for them!
What are you talking about?
What company was it?
It's a big region.
If you dont say anything I will assume its a plane crash.
You know, I got this little swelling right here. (rolls up his sleeve to expose his wrist) It's kinda painful. What d'you make of it?
Flip it.
No, no, no... Just a *tiny* bit... It's not even *frontal* nudity. It's... *sidal* nudity...
You think it's something?
No problem here.
Yeah, I think I got a touch of something, too.
Oh. This I need. Hello!! Hello. i..i..is this the hair restoration clinic? ...Does anyone speak English?
Well, if it's as good as ``Ponce de Leon'', I'll be happy.
Aw, well, you know, it's your anniversary. It's - it's the least I can do. I - I just want you guys to go out and have a good time. Ha ha. So, you think we should, uh, we should get downstairs?
(Silently squinches his mouth and nods at Kramer)
Im letting you in.
Ever since I found out that you let that message on Jerry's tape recorder I...
(gets up and picks a mirror) Yes. Yes, it's white. Why it's white.
Took a shot.
An idea for the show.
What's that?
I will not blow this.
Youre a fine person. Youre a humanitarian. Shes very sexy.
ha Ha..
That's not the point. The point is I was here first.
I wasn't talking to you.
Si, si.
You know, I have to tell you something. You couldn't get me on a plane right now. I get those FAA reports directly. My uncle sends them to me, he used to be a pilot, so. Big investigation in the, uh, what's the word there, uh, offing. It's in the offing. But, you know, you shouldn't let that stop you from going. You could go. I don't mind.
Who's Killer Kowalski?
Si, por favor.
Hands a little smelly?
Smile
I feel like I'm in bed with my mother.
Im starving! I can feel my stomach sucking up against my spine.
(Persistent) Perhaps you could look again, please? Im very hungry.
You know, I could have actually gone to that.
I think you're right. You gonna eat that?
Well, I, I got the pilot of the Jerry show.
She must have slipped it in here.
(Still on the hot water) What about shaving?
She's not there. She left. She must've waited and left because those people wouldn't get off the phone.
Hey-hay! Lloyd! Hey! My friend Jerry eh.
I can't believe I didn't push for this sooner.
No, no. Hes just being modest.
You idiots. You're gonna wear down the battery.
Why don't we talk about it another time.
Ah! See? I told ya.
(still on the phone) All right fine.... Whatever
I can't go out there, he knows we're friends.
Okay. (Chewing) Thanks anyway. (Continues to chew as he exits)
I don't know how you can let this guy handle all your money.
Why don't you just ask Jeffrey?
Hey check this out. I go to pick up my pictures and she says " I hope you got that mustard stain out of your shirt."
Kramer,
We should take his limo.
Course, I wouldn't, I mean uh, the guy is uh, well obviously (to Cynthia, as she passes) the guy has his problems.
What do you mean?
My parents are moving to Florida!
Eh...come oooon...(starts stabbing the paper with the pen. Mr. Wilhelm comes in)
Elaine's in love with the Wiz guy?
Yes!
You go in the living room. I'll take the test in here.
Well, that pear shaped loser was me! And I was in that photo, until I broke in here, stole the photograph and airbrushed myself out of there!
Alleluia.
Woah, I gotta watch this guy's bag.
You know it's like you never see a really attractive woman getting a traffic ticket.
The busboy's coming?
Look, we're not gonna be that long anyway... we have to get to the "party"!
Oh, see? that's why I don't have cable in my house. Because of that naked station. If I had that in my house, I would never turn it off. I wouldn't sleep, I wouldn't eat. Eventually, firemen would have to break through the door, they'd find me sitting there in my pajamas with drool coming down my face. All right, all right. So you're watching the naked station.
Great move, telling him, by the way, real smart move.
What does that mean?
I can't say.
Briefcase. (Shrugs and exits.)
OH MY GOD!!!
I wonder what toilet paper was loike in the 1860's. Did they carry it in rolls in their duffle bags?
Liam Neeson. You know, he's not American.
Alright I happen to know what they did last night, they had dinner with Kramer.
I thought we'd all sign the picture.
Hey Kramer, c'mon-- it was 240 bucks twenty years ago...
I'm back, baby, I'm back!
What is he talking about?
I'd like to hear that.
An apartment-warming gift? We got to give presents to people for moving? Birthdays, Christmas, it's enough gifts. I would like one month off.
I love the chop sticks. I, I personally prefer a fork but they look very nice.
Wait a second, wait a second, what coming in, what woman is coming in?
I--I've been, walkin' around all night.. I've been thinkin' about Allison and me.. an' you--
She knows that I have her clock. I know that she has my hat. I think she's getting ready to make an exchange.
No. Youd be surprised. You dont recover that quickly from a nose job.
(Nervous) Wh-what are you talking about? That - that's rediculous.
I did it. Hunh, we're going out as soon as she gets off of work and it'll still be daytime. You know I, Im much better in the daytime then I am at night. it's less pressure.
That's where I come in. Umm, on splat. Uh, you see, Mrs. Sweedler, or is it hospital administrator Sweedler?
I'll leave when the guy comes in. I gotta tell you, I am loving this yada yada thing. You know, I can cross over my whole life story. (Picks up dental tool)
He he he he
Oh, come on! You gotta get me over there!
George is in big trouble....
And I'm moving out of my parents' house, I'm taking that apartment on 86th street, remember the one we saw?
This is a huge project involving lots of numbers and papers and folders.
I got it.
Not that much. You know, they tend to shrink in the water.
Who says?
Well, you know. (grins, snorts) It's understandable.
So it was a good experience.
Uuh, no, no.
Kramer was on Murphy Brown? That son of a gun!
Simmer!
Would they tune in?
Alright, the dentist thing was not good.
You broke up with her? Why?
Then I see my clothes floating out there. The tied took them out, not the kids.
"What day is today?....Aw. ..Tuesday! Damn it. I shouldn't have worked out today. Mr Wilhem has called a big meeting and now I'm gonna be sweating through the whole thing."
Good morning, sir.
Yeah. (clears his throat) We should do this again.
Where's the sunblock?
Channel eleven? Forgive me for trying to class up this place, for trying to have the Yankees reach another strata of society that might not watch channel eleven.
Can I ask you a question? Would you mind switching seats?
Pick up the phone, Elaine. Pick it up!
This is gonna be fun.
I made him up.
Gary? Well, well, well well. Where the hell've you been? I've been leaving you phone messages for months.
What was wrong with that? I had a different interpretation! Do you know anything about this pretzel guy?! Maybe he's been in the bar a really long time and he's really depressed because he has no job and no woman and he's parking cars for a living! (out the window to honking cars) Alright! Alright! Shut up! Shut up! I hear you! I'm coming down! These pretzels are making me thirsty!
Well played.
Yeah.
So in order to use these, I gotta spend like fifteen-hundred bucks. This is a bill for fifteen-hundred dollars. Plus, she'd ask about the sleeping arrangements, that whole sleeping arrangement conversation is depressing.
(to Jerry) Huh-ho! Have you ever seen anything like this?
Babu Bhatt? How I'm going to explain this?
My in-laws. Oh, my....
So, you live with your mother, huh?
What's with all these flags?
Food?
Oh (snorts) Articulate....Me? I've never articulated anything, i'm completely incoherent.
(over the speaker) It's George.
No everything is *not* going good. I'm very uncomfortable. I have no power. I mean, why should she have the upper hand. *Once* in my life I would like the upper hand. I have no hand-- no hand at all. She has the hand; I have *no* hand...
I can't have an affair with a married woman, that's despicable!
You know what I was just thinking -- she could really use a raise.
Maybe you should call your car phone.
If only something like that could happen to me.
What did you do?
Really?
Yeah.
What do you mean not goin'? Come on, we got plans here. Call her up.
Ah, not yet.
Alright, then. We've gotten to the bottom of that.
(on phone) . It's George Costanza. . are there any messages for me? Why does Mr. Steinbrenner want to see me in his office? . . . Communist? I'm not a Communist . . . . All right, all right. All right, I'll be there. - ( hangs up ) My secretary Ada, told Mr Steinbrenner I'm a Communist Now he wants to see me in his office.
Did you here that? I can't believe this he's eating his sandwich.
It's like puberty that never stops. Ear puberty, nose puberty, knuckle puberty, you gotta be vigilent. Let me ask you this Do you know where Walker Street is downtown? I've got a league meeting there.
Kramer!
He eats those?
(ready to leave) Well, thank you.
Wow, just felt your material?
That's no tragedy! How many people do you lose on a normal cruse? 30? 40?! Kramer, can I take a look at that book? (Starts walking tward the door. Kramer grabs his food, and follows)
My parents don't read! They're gonna wonder what a book is doing on the table!
There's no chance of that.
That's right, Ricky Boy, it's me!
Nine. Thirt... thirteen's no good.
Yes it is.
No, not Lloyd Braun. But the cashier.
No! I'm not gonna do that! That's one step away from personal ads! And prostitutes! No! No, I am not going down that road! What does she look like?
(Disappointed) A frog?
Dont you think you get more without it?
Yeah, it bothers me. Doesn't it bother you?
Are you looking deep down at the real person underneath?
First she screams, "George, what are you doing?! My God!" And it looked like she was gonna faint - she started clutching the wall, trying to hang onto it.
Parking in a handicap spot. Right in the middle of his United Volunteers meeting. When he got back, he chased after me with a baseball bat.
Yeah. Yeah, one second.
(shouting) No No No!
When are you going on your next date with her?
You are not gonna believe whats going on with this woman.
..So, one thing lead to another..
I don't want you to call.
Oh. Oh!
So, did you get your new plates?
(worried) Yeah, that's right. What if it's a genetic thing, like father like son?
A little notice would've helped! How many people?
(Arms out) I am king of the county. You?
No.
And the underwater bubble cities?
Yeah.
I got your calzones Mr. Steinbrenner.
"He jumps!"
In the whole world right now, there's maybe three emergencies. Why would you think, on this entire planet, that you're one of those three?
(from other room) Uh, tippy toe! Tippy toe! Lemon tree!
I thought I saw something fly over here...
Yeah.
I think this is him right here.
Yeah, they eh, they do a lot of baking up there.
(enthusiastic) And, you know, I do a lotta business with Japanese TV. They broadcast a lot of American baseball. They got an office here in New York!
I know. Don't you see. (emphatic) He was doing it to fool Lloyd Braun!
She's not out there!
All right! We're here!
Deeply in love. If you can't say anything bad about a relationship, you shouldn't say anything at all.
All my friends do that.
They're not mocked and humiliated when they get to the other side.
I have to talk to you about something .
" I'll always be a winner and you'll always be a loser." This is what he said to me.
No, no that's ah, that's pie country.
(After looking in the bag) The pea pods? All you saved was the pea pods? (Kramer enters)
A wheelchair? What for?
No, no, Kurt - wrong attitude. You should be happy now.
I mean you're just, you're just a marvel of organization.
Yup. It's really just a question of what kind. Thinking about a bar stool.
How could he not have washed?
Nnnnnnngaaa!
No. Now I'll always have this doubt about the car. What, your jaw still hurts?
I had to say something. (chuckles) I had to say something. Everything was going so well. I had to say something.
I love Juu-uuu-uu-uune!
You know, I'm sorry, I...I hate to be one of those people, but we're right in the middle of this thing...I can't hear.
I love this place. You know, Carl and I come here all the time.
Would I have had access to that?
Boy, that was awkward!
(on a pay phone) Hey, hey, it's George, I need ya to do me a favor.
[Realizing full well it isn't] ...Yes it is.
There was a box of raisins on the coffee table. Did you, by any chance, take them with you when left?
Hey, can I flip on the siren?
I just wanted to tell you that I really enjoyed Fair Game. I thought it was just brilliant.
(Looking at her nose) Is your nose pierced?
please please I don't want to die up here. please, stop moving that's all I'm asking.. Kramer!!
I dunno, Jerry somethin's missing. There's a void, Jerry, there's a void...
Yeah. I am like a drug dealer. I got the guy hooked. I am having lunch at his desk everyday this week. He doesn't make a move without me. It's very exciting.
Ya
Who do I like? I, like, uh, Art, Vandelay.
You can't do that, it's none of your business!
Fine.
(Pause) Yeah.
Please...
(coughs) I've always smoked.
This guy from my old neighborhood. Lloyd Braun. He's a big advisor to Mayor Dinkins. He thinks he's so cool.
Yeah, he's in my bed. I'm sleeping on the couch.
I don't know. I do know that I have some kind of a talent - something to offer. I just don't know what it is yet!
What? You mean with a knife?
Bosomy?
(Shocked) You caved?!
(to the other laundry patrons) Any questions?
No they don't. I tried that once. I snubbed for a year. Nothing. Every woman I saw, I snubbed. You never saw people so pleased. (Elaine returns from the bathroom.)
Did they take anything?
No, not nervous. I'm good, very good. (A beat, then he snaps) I can't do this! Can't do this!
And she didn't say something to you about a certain something?
Uh, Tim, the pencil...
What are you looking at me like that for?
A man carries a wallet.
What? I'm not married. I'm not allowed to go out with somebody else?
Hey.
So, I am have to going to break up with you.
Okay. How about this?
Yeah, good night.
Moops!
The show will be like a heart attack!
Can't leave the car here!
Puddys just gonna give you the car, huh? (Skeptically) Youll see. First they stick you with the undercoating, rust-proofing, dealer prep. Suddenly, youre on your back like a turtle.
Hey! (to Elaine, who doesn't look too cheerful)
How's everything going? Everything O.K.?
Yes, I will do the opposite. I used to sit here and do nothing, and regret it for the rest of the day, so now I will do the opposite, and I will do something!
Would you wait a second? Just wait? (They fight over it.)
You're blown?
Nucleosis.
Yes.
Wha! You know, it's a pain to change that. You gotta lift up that plastic thing with a pen.
Who!!?
You telling me that wine is better than Pepsi? Huh (snort), no way wine is better than Pepsi.
There it is. Gate 46... We got plenty of time.
I'll have the Clams Casino.
Yeah, that's right.
We are really late now. We're in big trouble. Big trouble.
What happened to the screen door? It blew off again?
I think that's one of mine.
George Costanza. Susan's, uh, friend? Long time no speak.
But Kramer, isn't it a question of hygiene?
Well, at least, I'm not carrying a purse.
Thanks. You know this could sound crazy but, what do you think about adding a drawer for - like a blanket?
Blackberry, Boysenberry ...
What, you know Jerry?
Say good-bye to Koko.
(sighs) Guess not. What should I do?
Yeah.
Jerry, I can't. It's like saying to Pavorotti, "Teach me to sing like you."
He didnt do anything, Jerry. Its a scam! Who told you to do that?
OOuuoo! They could use the break!
I don't find her attractive.
Alright, let's see, let's see. What else. What else. Oh yeah, what does she do?
Theres no way I touch that bag for less than two dollars.
Not possible.
Great. Seven-thirty, alright?
She's got everything, right? (counts on his fingers) She's intelligent, she's smart, she's got a great sense of humour.
Yes, of course I'm taking Allison. This woman is genetically engineered to go to a ball. Tall, blonde, lithe--
Oh. You still wanna go?
Well do you want me to take it off?
Is that it?
Yes. The legends are true.
Alright, you having a good time there?
Ahhhhh...
Why'd you pick Hoover? Was he that interesting to talk to?
(worked up) I can't have a cup of coffee with a person?! I'm not allowed to have coffee?!
All right. All right. Let's - let's go over that again.
Oh, yeah I'm sure he loves to hear from fans in the locker room.
Yea Yea Yea
Care? Forget about care. Love. They have to love the characters. Otherwise, why would they keep tuning in?
A decent hotel-room...
Of course not! Wash it, dry it, move on!
You talked all about that?
They asked you to do career day?
So good for you.
I called it.
The weather guy, Dr. Waldo.
Without thousands of fleeing Japanese.
I knew it. I always felt different.
Oh yes, of course, and we have to be fair. (placing the suit further away in the rack)
You know, about how when you break it down, it's really a very positive thing. you know, you have a nure, with a ma in front of it. MA-NURE. Iz not bad.
I think I saw him. I think it's him.
(angry) Well, that's the name!
I'm sorry about that lock on the liquor cabinet. The combination musta just flown outta my head. It's a mental block.
How as the date?
Hey oh.
That's a good score.
No... What guy?
Well, you know, It's interesting, you know, under that pressure, what you're capable of.
A fan? I would drape myself in velvet if it were socially acceptable. And look at this, hardwood floors!
No, you're not a divorcee. Youre just separated. You're---you're a separatee.
Is that what's hurting your appreciation for the story?
Where are you goin?
Hes an importer.
And so, for all these reasons, we are officially broken up. (shuts book and reaches for door) Thank you, (opens door) and good night.
(On the other line) Hey.
Oh yes I am Father. Incredibly sincere. So, uh, pffft, am I in?
You did?
It's coming Jerry, it's coming.
Five' eight. Five' seven.
Oh, I, uh--
So, she's the loser of the group. Every group has someone that they all make fun of.. Like us with Elaine. (Jerry thinks about this, then shakes it off)
I saw Amy making out with your cousin Jeffrey.
What, I'm puttin' my shirt back on.
I don't know why Rachel had to drive back with Michael and Carol.
(Jerry is going to his bedroom) What?
Ehh, You could get in trouble.
Hi.
Pennypacker. Varnsen.
You're sorry?!
Going backstage is the worst. Especially when they stink. You know that's a real problem.
Wait a second, where are you going?
Hey, Kramer, where are you going?
Carrie, could you do me a favour? Could you not mention this to your mother?
Okay, the point is made.
Can't be done.
Oh, that would be wonderful.
(thoughtful) Downtown.
I'll try some on and see how they look. It's just hair.
(Obviously knows that, but pretends he doesn't) What, tonight? Now?
Oh my god, maybe Gwen saw it. Maybe that's what did it.
Okay, I guess I'll see you down there.
Hey, hey.
I agreed to become his butler.
I dunno.
(Reading) I see here that you play the harp.. tell me, why do you have to tilt it? Can't you just build it on an angle? It'd save you a lot of trouble.
Uhh.. I'll- I'll meet you down there.
So you're Jason Hanke's supervisor?
. . . Why not?
Be careful, you're getting blood all over the car.
What do you mean?
Really? Coco?
How'd your foot fall asleep?
(Modest) Oh, thank you very much. (Chuckles)
After dark? Please. At their age, that's like swallowing stun grenades.
I mean, uh... I had fun ice skating.
Pack of gum. Here you go. (hands the clerk a $100 bill)
Yeah. Actually it was in gym class. I was trying to climb the ropes and Jerry was spotting me. I kept slipping and burning my thighs and then finally I slipped and fell on Jerry's head. We've been close ever since.
Well, it wouldn't fit you. The sleeves are too short.
Really good looking?
Why?
Of course it is.
Shut up!
Something's up, there's something in the air.
Why not? It's a good look for a woman.
I gotta try and find a way to switch places with him. It's like a Sigfried and Roy trick.
Well, I'm doing it, Jerry. I'm buying the Frogger machine. Now the torch will burn forever.
Hey, a shoe buffing machine!
(Praising Leo's stealing) Alright, Leo! Stickin' it to the man!
You told her? How could you tell her? I told you not to say anything.
(on phone, as Jerry gestures beside him) No, Lindsay, I had accidentally spilled coffee on the gentleman's windshield. Why would I do that? I have a job! Well, did she see a squeegee? Well, you're not going to make a dime without a squeegee. That's right, that's right, just tell your mother it was all a big misunderstanding. You won't regret it. Okay, I'll see you later. Buh-bye. (hangs up)
Ill meet her outside the building.
Men have been popping into my sexual fantasies. All of a sudden I'll be, in the middle.
Monica wants me to wear it.
And then I took my pants off.
Boy! What a story! I'm speechless. Speechless. I have no speech.
Hmm. Really? Nothing?
I won't be able to, concentrate in front of you.
(looking at his watch) I really should get going. Y'know, I..I wanna be home in case Neil calls.
That's insulting! Ted Danson makes eight hundred thousand dollars an episode.
Oh good.
You're smart, I'm dumb.
No, they're not funny at all. No, I have no funny friends. I'm the funny one. El Clowno.
I could never do that. You know the ironic thing is if she had a smaller nose, I never could have gone out with her in the first place. She'd be out of my league with a smaller nose. And I really like her, I know that. And I know one other thing. I'm not getting past that nose.
Hey.
What for?
"I have to go see Steinbrenner later. Mr Wilhelm told him that I was the one responsable for stealing all the merchandise."
Ah, ah, twenty to three.
To do what?! Work in a post office? Is that what you want me to do?
Aw great. Now the volume knob fell off
All right. (tearing his jacket off) Let me just say one thing there is no way that this is gonna happen. You hear me? No Way! Because if you think I'm going' to two Thanksgivings, you're out of your mind!!!
What are you talking about, that's seventy-five bucks! I'm not working, I can't afford that.
All right, we'll be a little late, I,m not taking a cab.
Well, aren't you something?
Nobody's faking.
(on the answering machine) Jerry, what's happening? Come on, pick up the phone.
Well(coughs) I can't stop now...(coughs) I'm addicted...
Do I really have to buy her something?
Yeah! like the big toe is like the captain of the toes, but sometimes the toe next to the big toe gets so big that there's like a power struggle and the second toe assumes control of the foot.
What did I get or what do I say I got?
So long, Mr. Farkus.
Well, I assume there's some sort of write-off.
C'mon, c'mon...(stands up and physically rolls Betsy to the left side of the couch.) See, now, is that so bad?
Oh, you know, Lloyd, I really don't have it.
I was there! I saw a drain!
Sorry, the players will be reimbursed?
How can I do this? How can I move back in with those people? Please, tell me. They're insane. You know that.
Yeah, that's right.
Oh with all due respect, I went there too, and I work for a team that just won the World Series.
Oh, no. We left on good terms.
*I* think that *you* think that a certain *something* is not all that it could be, when in fact it is is all that it *should* be, and *more*!
What were you doing?
You're so uptight.
No, I didn't hear anything.
Wow.
Oh, I don't know.
They wanted to read a Truman Capote book.
I got to tell you I felt terrible. I really thought she was going to collapse and kill herself.
(Yelling out, frustrated. The camera spins from a top angle) Twwwwiiiiiixxxxx!
Hey, Jerry, remember Frogger? I used to be so into this game. Gettin' that frog across the street was my entire life.
Yeah.
What, she's ranking you?
Well I-I...
To hell with Elaine!
kissed me. We both had tears streaming down our faces. I never saw anyone so beautiful. It was at that moment that I decided to tell her that, I was not a marine biologist.
You mean alias.
Hey, Lloyd. (Shakes hands with Lloyd) How's it going? (chuckles)
I don't want to! I'm outta money! I got 714 dollars left in the bank.
Yeah, yeah, like it's just part of the conversation. Oh my boyfriend really likes watches. He's a real watch freak. We-e-ell that's fabulous. (snaps fingers in the air a couple of times)
(through mouthful of food) So, Carrie, you and Susan are cousins. So your baby daughter is gonna be Susan's second cousin, right? So what does that make me?
Oh, yeah, right. I wish I had something on my mind. (pregnant pause) So how about that Kramer, huh?
Jerry?
Somebody did that?
Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute, don't tell me, don't tell me. It starts with a . . . Duncan Meyers. Oh, wow, this is something. I haven't seen you guys in what, twenty years?
When you sent me the-the bill for the dry-cleaning. I thought the show didn't have a chance.
Ive spent the last hour preparing ten candy bars with no wrappers or identification of any kind for him to select from.
Yeah, I should do the opposite, I should.
Goodbye (exits cab)
I don't know, I have to call her, tell her where we are. I'm very lucky she's even considering seeing me at all.
Yeah, yeah, should've written it down.
Alright, now. What mood am I in, what mood am I in?
(inhales deeply) I tell you, Jerry, I'm feeling something. Something I haven't felt in a long time.
Why does he have to stand?
This is the thing where you go and you have to make your own pizza?
What are we supposed to do? What do you do on a situation like this? Should we call a lawyer, should we call the police?
Allright, I gotta head back right away, I'll-Ill -- I gotta figure something out here.
I'll tell you what's insane the price that I could get you on a new desktop computer.
(crestfallen) But you said it was my call.
Already you're marrying this guy?
(Getting up) You know what? Maybe I should take off.
Like what? What could they say?
Sorry. I'll just go back to my usual routine.
It's a bit hilly - no?
The contest - I cheated.
You haven't even seen one.
I leave you alone for two seconds, and this is what you do! I trusted you!
I'm not! I'm inside the walls!
Because it's on TV.
Is there something wrong with my parents?
So, Dad...
No problem.
(Daring) You think you could?
What did we say? Two seventy-five?
Well I gotta undo what I did.
Yeah. Me too.
(Reflecting on his life gone wrong) This McKigney guy had a few good years.. (To Kramer, bitter) How could you forget to turn off an iron?
Excuse me. Is this, uh, Rage-aholics?
You do it for me.
Well it was a helluva yada yada.
Oh, she's a Kramer. And uh, while I was there I uh happened to pick up another juicy little nugget about our friend.
No no, I never said I was a good driver, I said I was a good parker.
I swear, I swear!
I loved her!
Or maybe, she just wanted to go to the Tony's. I tell you what; you ask her out again. No Tony, just Jerry. That way you know it he was her dude or just some dude.
Are you crazy? You take your life in your hands with those nuts.
Just one? I'm living like twenty. (chuckles) What's yours?
I can't have any parties while they're out of town. (he leaves to return the soaps)
He forced me to!
Two no-tucks.
Boy, you look really great.
Right. (Mumbles) Nastercoff.. What country is he from, again?
Yeah, here you go.
(Frantically) Did anybody call here asking for Vandelay industries?
Mr. Thomassoulo during times of great stress, people are capable of super human strength. Have you ever seen the Incredible Hulk, sir?
I just thought of a great name for myself, if I ever become a porno actor.
I was quoting him. Why would I be insulted? I'm never insulted. You could call me baldy, dump soup on my head. Nothing insults me.
How's that Tony?
(frustrated) Take it easy! Huh! Take it easy!
Come on let's get out of here.
Holistic.. that sounds right.
So, Elaine, are you going to sleep with me or what?!
They will get a good home won't they?
All right, All right, all, right!!( gives the headphones to Kramer) How you gonna find out who this is?
Well I guess that's because I wear boxer shorts.
Oh, not more building.
Squirrel? Well, we have no deal with THEM!
(Reluctantly) Well, okay.
(singing)  Master of the house/Keeper of the inn... (Jerry re-enters the living room and modestly models his new jacket for George. George is impressed.) This is huge! When did this happen?
Why do I do anything? tsss...For women.
Alright, Jerry, I'm gonna get my coat.
Here we go, LA.
Did anybody see Firestorm?
I don't.
Well, if it doesn't concern me, then I can stay. (Kramer grabs the back of George's chair, drags him out into the hallway and closes the door.)
They got a new intern from Francis Louis High. His name is Keith. He comes in Mondays after school.
(holding his cane) I gotta hobble. (walks out)
Potussan. Ever try it with club soda?
(to Carrie) You know, you're really being very selfish. It would be nice if you would think of someone other than yourself every now and then!
I heard what you said "Sharon, are you there?".
All right, do you mind? I have the window! (To Willie) Now, what are you gonna do about my Twix?
Two fifty? Are you sure
(Interrupting) Anyway, I just wanted to let you know I'm really sorry that happened, and if I can help out in any way, I'll certainly be glad to do that. (Pause) Well, I guess that's about it.
Nothing, why? You think something's wrong? Am I different?
Oh, I, uh, I disagree. You've, uh, you've been living in America too long. (indicates the bag of oranges) You've forgotten what it's like to have no oranges.
You got mugged?
Siege mentality, Jerry. They really want me out of here. Theyve downgraded me to some sort of a bunker. Im like Hitlers last days here.
Oh really. You tell her you shaved it?
Singapore?! Do you hear this?
Yes well unfortunately you'll never get the chance to find out.
Yeah. Anyway, he shamed me into it.
"Jerry", oh my God. He wants to talk about "Jerry"?
Ahh, Hey-Ho. ahhhhh (exhales)
I can produce Keith Hernandez right here within the hour.
You could take the IQ test for me. I could pass it to you out a window. We could do it, she lives in the first floor.
I don't know her.
Kramer!
How does Tim Whatley even know Newman?
When is it going to be my turn, Jerry? When do I get my 15 minutes? I want my 15 minutes!
Im not doing that.
Yes. Changes.
Why didn't you take your car?
Like what?
Why do they have to do that in front of people?
Oh, nothin' much, . . . talkin'. . . . Oh, oh, oh, did I have an unbelievable idea today!
She probably never heard it. Don't you see what this means? It's like the whole thing never happened. It's like when Superman reversed the rotation of the earth to save Lois Lane!
Well, I gotta go back there and try again. Hi Sheila.
He chose the cats?
Who am I going to tell? My mother? Like I've got nothing better to talk about.
Well, live and learn.
Well, of course they're trying to screw you. What do you think? That's what they do. They can make up anything. Nobody knows. "By the way, you need a new Johnson rod in there." "Oh, a Johnson rod. Yeah, well, you better put one of those on."
Ade, I have to tell you, I, I have never met anybody so ... efficient.
Why did you give him my ticket for?
Woah, back it up, back it up. Beep, beep, beep. Tractor story?
You don't think you can buy the ticket yourself...? No, there, there...you sit, and I'll purchase the ticket for you.
Because you were being so nice.
This is the life! Isn't it, huh, kid?
Well...I was in the locker room showering, and I...I had to go, so...
Hey! Great plane! Thanks a lot. Piece of junk. You know you almost got us killed!
I said, Listen Marlene, and then the next thing I know, Im in the middle of it. And theres this voice inside of me going, Youre doing it! Youre doing it! And then she started to cry, and I weakened a bit. I almost relented, but the voice, Jerry, the voice said, Keep going, keep going. Youre almost out! Its like I was making a prison break, you know, and Im heading for the wall, and I trip and I twist my ankle, and they throw the light on you, you know. So, somehow I get though the crying and I keep running. Then the cursing started. Shes firing at me from the guard tower. Son of a bang! Son of a boom! I get to the top of the wall  the front door. I opened it up, Im one foot away, I took one last look around the penitentiary, and I jumped!
(anxious) I forgot who I am! Who am I?!
Nothing.
Jerry, let's face it, I've always been handicapped. I'm just now getting the recognition for it. Name one thing I have that puts me in a position of advantage. Huh? There was a guy that worked at the Yankees-- no arms! He got more work done than I did, made more money, had a wife, a family, drove a better car than I did.
(shamefaced) No.
I can't imagine.
And then you came here.
Well who doesn't.
What is Holland?
Yeah? How?
Oh, Safire. Uh ha
Oh man.
The catering hall screwed up. The wedding is delayed until June. It's like a stay of execution.
Because Im not Latvian Orthodox. Her parents wont let her get involved with anyone who isnt Latvian Orthodox.
I just wanted to talk to him for a minute, but Ill come back.
So, um, you've read "The Big Game", have you?
Still lookin'. It's pretty bad out there. What about you?
Yeah. Thanks. Hey, listen, if you ever get a date, maybe the four of us could go out together sometime.
It's not my fault! I wasn't going to do anything until you got her all juiced up with your story about having the affair with the matador!
Oh, Tara!
I heard the last guy got fired because his nose whislted.
GUILTY!
How would you like a 'Hare Krishna' fist on your throat, you little punk?
I don't understand lunch, I don't know anything about lunch. Listen. Just because I got the guy fired doesn't mean I turned him into a bum - does it?
Look, I guarantee she won't know.
You don't have to pay for the massage?
Oh, I think that's fantastic. Good for you. Nice. That's very nice.
Hey.
Alright, alright, fine. (Gives the keys to Elaine.)
(still pleased) She doesn't know that. We say that you do.
I, ... am breaking up with, ... you.
I know what you're going through. Women. Who knows what they want?
Thank God that's over.
Uh huh. Uh huh! I think you spoke to your little friend Rachel, that's what I think.
Listen, lemme ask you a question. What if I got a cup of coffee with her?
Bring it on!
I'm an architect.
Yeah, he's something, isn't he?
Oh, Im crazy!
"All right Jimmy Good talking to ya."
(seeing his parents being intimate) Oh, my god!
(Yelling out) It's my apartment, Eldridge! The Stalkholm may not have sunk ya, but I will! Ha, ha, ha!
All right, you know you're not any help at all here. I don't know what even the point is of talking to you anymore.
Oh! Modelling! What's that like? Fun? Ha ha. (to self in head) Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!
Your boyfriend reads the Daily Worker? What is he? A communist?
What did you go on a picnic?
He knows I'm waiting. He sees me. He just doesn't wanna look.
That's right! He never apologized to me for saying that I would stretch out the neck hole of his sweater.
Sweetheart, I was exaggerating.
The guy never came back.
I just popped in now. I'm a big pop-in guy.
Wha.. you ran?
But I'm backing in! You can't put it in head first!
Lemme tell you something, that Jerry Lewis? You wonder how some of these people get to the top? It's ideas like this! Brilliant! Hah-hah! (Notices that the briefcase is damaged.) Look at this - what the hell happened? The whole side is damaged here...and the lock is broken.
Alright, we're back in!
So...
How come we never hear him?
I'm not really sure, I...
Yeah. The *original*.
(claps hands triumphantly) We might have an 'it'!
I uh got the first name.
Jerry, it's me, George, don't worry, I'll return it
. . . she scooped her niblets?
No good?
Oh yes, by no means, the mood. Let me know if there's anything I can do to lend support to the mood.
I tell you this. If the real Phil Rizzuto was down there, this wouldn't be happening!
Well I, uh, I'm not sure how you pronounce it or anything, but I, uh, I believe it's Mnage  Trois?
Lo..k, if you want to taste mine, you don't have to offer me some of yours.
(frustrated) Ohh, I wanted to see that. (waves his arms in frustration) Thanks. Thanks a lot.
Going to need a little more coffee here.
I didn't do nothin'.
I love that bathroom. It's got that high, high toilet. I feel like a gargoyle perched on the ledge of a building.
You know a matron?
Right.
Well I think I'm better off going one-on-one.
Obviously.
(shouting) Get your Paliachi!
Ohh, yeahh.
All right, shes not even gonna ask, if we see her, which is remote.
Yes, I sure did.
They never try anything.
Who invaded Spain in the Eighth Century?
We had sex.
Oh my God, I forgot!
Im fine.
My tonsils? Yeah, when I was a kid.
What?
You think the person you were talking to is him? That's not even close to him. He's funny, Jerry's funny.
What does she look like?
...So, anyway, if you think about it, manure is not really that bad a word. I mean, it's 'newer', which is good, and a 'ma' in front of it, which is also good. Ma-newer , right?
Hey, Jerry, how was Ithaca?
(Yelling out to the whole coach) Funny guy! (Points to Jerry) Right here!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
(Loud, so everyone at the wedding can hear) You slept with the groom?!
(suspicious) You didn't say hello?
But I have to have them by one o'clock. He's very regiment about his meals.
Yeah?
Double jump! Eat the fly! Eat it!
Yeah, like I'm going to risk my job with the New York Yankees to make a few extra bucks. (winks)
In a manner of speaking.
He..He threatened me.
Yes, well, if the other people in the office saw that I called an exterminator, they would just panic. Besides, this is sort of a friendly visit. Carl, right?
Oh yeah.
Kissing is sex.
Susan! Jerry! Where are you? I know you're there! Answer me!
N.I. Not interested.
Im nervous.
What?
Ah you have no idea of the magnitude of this thing. If she is allowed to infiltrate this world, then George Costanza as you know him, Ceases to Exist! You see, right now, I have Relationship George, but there is also Independent George. That's the George you know, the George you grew up with -- Movie George, Coffee shop George, Liar George, Bawdy George.
(Stopping him) Ah, excuse me. When your, uh, when your wallet was open, I - I glanced inside, and I couldnt help but notice that you have several crisp dollar bills.
Have you seen 'em?
Yes. Live, dammit. Live! Every precious moment as if this was the last year of your life. Because in many ways...it is. (There's a knock at the door.) Excuse me.
I just don't like the idea that any time theres a dinner invitation there's this annoying little chore that goes along with it.
Of course, I'm the result of my parents having stayed together, so you never know. (Russell comes out of the bathroom.)
Oh! Dropped a napkin...(Whispers) Jerry!
Really? Who?
Where are you goin'..
Ross'.
Why can't I stay?
Yes.
He's right. never.
Well... (shuts door) heeere we are (puts down his coat and chuckles)
MOOPS
Mr. Morgan! Did you hear that? Mr. Morgan!
What, you don't think I can attract beautiful, intelligent women?
She's still doing that?
Yea I-I know about the cups.
Yes, it was purple, I liked it, I dont actually recall considering the buttons.
Who's he?
Well, Tony.. took a bit of a tumble
Well, you didn't hear it from me, but needless to say, if you go in there - stick with the consumee.
You know what the temperature in Florida is today? Eh? Seventy-nine. That's almost eighty. Yeah, I read someplace the life expectancy in Florida is eighty-one and in Queens, seventy-three.
Get out!! (Jerry gets out and George drives away. A couple of guys notice Jerry in his cowboy boots.)
Well it's tough to get a good read but I think if I brought him a chair, he'd sit.
Ah, Oh boy.
All the time.
Jerry, figure this out. I'm in the coffee shop, and this beautiful girl I could never even talk to, mistakes me for her boyfriend.
a piece?
Heh, that's right. See ya later. (Exits.)
Hey.
It's George.
Eh, there's that woman that never talks to anybody.
A-hu no, uh, it's just that ...
Which market, the, eh, big one, the big market, the big board. Bull market, bear market, you name the market, I'm there.
You should be the one criticizing me. I, I'm lucky to even know someone like you.
Oh, I just, uh, leased a house out in the Hamptons, and I have got to get out there this weekend and sign the papers.
She cant kill me right?
Would you stop that please. Would you just stop that?
Yeah, take care. Stay in touch.
I love the mirror in that bathroom! I dont know what in the hell it is. I look terrific in that mirror. (George sits.) I dont know if its the tile or the lighting... I feel like Robert Wagner.
Jerry?
Maybe I am.
Yeah, I mentioned Simons. Next thing I know, Im in the parking lot. Perhaps they had some sort of a falling out. Ill tell you one thing. I dont know what hes got. But for a sick guy, hes very strong.
All right. So, he caught me in a cleavage peek, so big deal. Who wouldn't look at his daughter's cleavage? She's got nice cleavage.
Wo-hoah! What did you do?
I mean we can put a man on the moon but we're still basically very stupid. The guy who's car this is? He could be one of the guys that built the rocket. You see what I'm saying?
I'm not through here, Jerry. (Picks up the model of the conference room.) I'm gonna keep on investigating. This thing is like an onion. The more layers you peel, the more it stinks. (Pam enters, George leaves.)
Live?
Nope! (Starts heading for the door)
Not me. Everything should be negotiable. (he picks up a container of fruit)
Why would we want to help somebody?
He uh...doesn't have any running water?
Okay.
I know it's a doll, but it looks like my mother!
Yeah, and a whole new me. I'm up two inches in these babies!
Yes, yes,.
Well, we.. we, we, ah..
Listen to the comeback. (pleased) 'Oh yeah? Well the jerk store called. They're running outta you.'
No, her too. And her mother.
Jay Crespi, how am I gonna forget Jay Crespi?
Jean-Paul?
She supports her whole family. (walking slowly into the room)
Oh, yeah. You wish you had this coat.
(Defensively) He knows how to read. And he also knows finishing an entire book doesn't prove anything. And get this he's into architecture.
You're *damn* right it's me.
What do you mean, I got? You didn't give him his Visa application.
That's what I want.
(Laughs) Relationship intern...hey, what if two of us teamed up?
I don't know. (George sits down at the table. Kramer enters.)
It's Allison. I dated her right after you. She's obsessed with me.
Wow,  god! You see this is all I think about. Sleeping with a giant. It's my life's ambition.
(to himself) A cane. I knew it. (to Neil) So, we meet at last. I admire your skills, Mr Peanut.
Yea, well, maybe some parts.
Hey, she wants me to dress uh "smart casual." What uh, what is that?
And... and anybody can do this?
Sure. Thank you for coming in. (Tom eats some raisins)
Alright, start looking for spaces.
She hasn't seen the article! When she sees it, she's gonna think-- *I'm out baby*!! I'm out!!!!!
Wow, is she not terrific?
He didn't say anything.
And everything else has changed. But toilet paper is exactly the same, and will be so until we're dead.
The Lowers, really?
Yeah.
No, that's Jerry.
No, I'm a friend of Elaine Benes.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. It's from that grapefruit that Jerry squirted at me.
Hey, Al. How's it going?
Who cares about eyebrows? Is she sweet? I like sweet. But not too sweet, you could throw up from that.
Yeah.. may - maybe I'll meet ya?
Sons of bitches!
To spite your parents!
Nobody drives like me. Nobody. I'm doing things in this car, you have no idea they're going on. Wanna see me make a right turn from the left lane? Watch this.
If she doesnt show up, we cant possibly have dinner with him alone.
The Rogue's Wallet. That's where he kept his card, his dirty little secret. Short, devious, balding. his name was Costanza. He killed my mother.
Well, why didn't they ask me?
I'm just sayin' I wanna have some fun.
I can see that.
I've seen squeeze mustard. I've never seen squeeze ketchup.
Heh, haa. And that's no good. I've tried it straight, Jerry. We've all seen the results. For me, sick is the only way to go.
I have to get in touch with Tatiana! And look at his little outfit. It's all so coordinated, the way his socks matching to his shirt. I really hate this guy.
Him who? Hayman him.
Yeah.
Boy - I'm really surprised at Elaine - that whole phone business - she should know better than that.
Champagne?
Excuse me.
Well, you should always consider podiatry. (Patting Ricky on the shoulder) There's nothing wrong with the feet. (Ricky looks critically back at George)
No, I'm gonna hold it under her nose so she can smell the scent of stale Bosco that I had to live with for three years, and I'm gonna say, "Remember this shirt, baby?! Well, now, it's payback time!"
She's, uh, she's heard of Merlot.
What?
Maybe somebody did it and didn't take credit for it. Maybe it was already done and didn't need doing in the first place. I have no idea who did it, what they did, or how they did it so well. And you know what? Jimmy crack corn and I don't care.
Were you just talking about me? What's going on?
(modest) And I'm a little tired.
Absolutely nothing.
(uncomfortablly) Thank you.
No, it isn't.
On an elevator? You met a woman on an elevator?
Wait a minute. (astonished) You're thinking of moving to Florida again?!
Wait. Whoa! That's the Rabbi from Elaine's building. I just met this guy the other day.
Take it easy. Take it easy. It's not the end of the world.
No!
Oh, o.k., yeah. Where am I gonna park here...? (Pulls over.)
You went for the big "E".
Carl... Yeah, he was a nice guy.
Excuse me, uh, what are you doing in there?
(hangs up the phone) That's my toaster. I got to go. Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh!
(chuckles) Bye, thanks. (To Jerry, when Susan is far) I can't believe she took the money.
How engrossing?
I have an idea.
(Pleading for them to stop) Mom.. dad.
Two theaters?
Oh boy..
Just the last few innings of a double-header.
You know, like the general manager of a baseball team or something.
That's a little steep don't you think?
What's he going to do? That's exactly the point. Nobody knows what this guy is capable of! He fires people like it is a bodily function.
I was supposed to see her. She wasn't supposed to see me.
He's on vacation.
I'd go to prison as your accomplice. I'd have to wear that really heavy denim. Go to the cafeteria line with the guy who slops those mashed potatoes onto your plate. Go to the bathroom in front of hundreds of people.
Hey/Hi/Hello (etc.)
I don't want hope. Hope is killing me. My dream is to become hopeless. When you're hopeless, you don't care, and when you don't care, that indifference makes you attractive.
What about a rec room? Huh? Or a community center.
(clearing his throat, he changes his order for Susan) Baked, uh, potato.
I told her I was out o' soda, I went out to get some, an' I never went back.
What?
(triumph) Alright.
Wyck.
Well, we're collectors. We, uh, see objects of great beauty and, uh, we must have them.
It's George.
Peggy! (they all sit) His daughter Peggy. Peggy's coming over to serve.
Not necessarily. Mustard lends itself to the squeeze.
Oh, nothing happened, but it was...
Keep going.
Well, I can't crack this one.
Oh, thank you.
(Whispering to Jerry) What time is our flight back? I got to go to the bathroom.
Oh.
Go, go, go, don't worry about it.
I dont know whatcha had to tell her that for. You put me in a very difficult position, Marine Biologist! I'm very uncomfortable with this whole thing.
Because? Because?
Nothing except Prognosis Negative.
A stock.
(tormented) Aw, shut up Jerry! Just shut up!
(Thomassoulo helps George get up) Yeah, what the hell.
Where is he?
Hey, you're hurting me!
Yeah. Really.
(Showing Jerry up) Listen carefully. My mother has never laughed. Ever. Not a giggle, not a chuckle, not a tee-hee.. never went 'Ha!'
(ON PHONE) It's a '76 Chevy Impala. They stole it right in front of the hospital. I saw the guy drive off in it. Well he's about five feet tall, hairless, pink complexion.. (Elaine puts her finger on her nose) looks like a pig. Yeah, alright alright, thank you, thank you. (Kramer enters) So any word from the "pig-man"?
What did she say?
Well, you know, I gotta go to, uh, Susan's parent's house for dinner.. and, you know, I want to shower first.. and I want to leave myself plenty of time.
She made a big breakfast every Sunday. I don't know what she put in those eggs.
Jerry Seinfeld. My best friend. He can explain all of this. (calls to Jerry) Jerry.
When I was ten years old, my parents had this very same statue on the mantle of our apartment. Exactly. And, one day, I grabbed it, and I was using it as a microphone. I was singing, MacArthur Park, and I got to the part about, Ill never have that recipe again, and it slipped out of my hand and it broke. My parents looked at me like I smashed the ten commandments. To this day, they bring it up. It was the single most damaging experience in my life, aside from seeing my father naked.
It better be.
(gestures towards book) But I proved it!
I have to do this, it's a matter of honor.
That's a tough minute. It's like waiting in the shower for the conditioner to work.
No, no! You can't throw me out
No doors?
It varies.
Oh, it had to happen!!
I'm sorry I'm sorry, here's the test. Thanks again for doing this - hhe.
Susan, why?
(to Carrie) You know, the thing is, I kinda promised the widow Mantle that I would name my baby Seven.
(positive) Yes. From endorsing checks for the Super Terrific Happy Hour. (laughs)
I want evens.
Well then...then you really have something to think about because.....you know if there's any doubt in your mind ....and.. and,, it doesn't even have to be a big doubt, you know even a tiny doubt, a DOT of a doubt.. and.....
Come on. Will you stop it.
A man gave me... a massage. hu, hu
This guy sounds just like me.
Who's Sid?
Because it's really a pretty good little story. Don't you think?
Im not going with him. I dont even know the guy. (to the teller) Look, they did this for me before.
I'm positive I gave you a twenty.
I'd like to rent Breakfast At Tiffany's.
You had Sgt. Chadway? Me too.
It seems like a problem.
Alright, what's the difference. What are we gonna do now? He won't take our calls, we can't get into his office...
Oh. How's she doing?
Yeah, they're all through ruining my life. What the hell are they still doing here? Lemme see this pamphlet. Hm. All right, so I'll, uh, get back to you.
You know, my mother used to walk around on our apartment just in her bra and panties. She didn't look anything like you, she was really disgusting, really bad body. If you could imagine uglier and fatter version of Shirley Booth. Remember Shirley Booth from Hazel. Really embarrassing, cause you know I had only mother in the whole neighborhood who was worse looking than Hazel. Imagine the taunts I would hear.
Really!
I'm sure we're all aware of the flaws and biases of standardized tests..
Yoohoo ,Plenty......Wh..wh..what are doing hum...you're going in?
Oh yeah, real cool. You're a cool guy.
I am aware!
What??
Well, what's so great about a Mom and Pop store? Let me tell you something. If my Mom and Pop ran a store, I wouldn't shop there.
Wa, uh, ...
(animated) N..no, no. You can't leave me. (frantic) Marry me! I'll burn myself. I'll burn my parents!
They're making their decision today.
This is a guy I know.. Kramer.
Into what?
What's with all the butter?
No. No
You know, Einstein wore the exact same outfit every day.
(opening door to leave) He picked her up?
YYYDDSSHE(?) ... Jose Jimenez. You recognize it?
Some other time.
I, I think I made my point. I'm sorry if I was a little harsh.
Embracing my roots.
Oh my God...You're in jail? (Celia nods.) That is so cool!
What?
What the hell.
Alright, whatever! Now. Whatever caused the damage...(drops a tiny briefcase onto the table in the model)...was jarring enough to completely stop the tape.
Oh no - I'm so sorry, it's the Moops. The correct answer is the Moops.
I know, I know...don't skimp. Go go go go...
Look, I am under direct orders from Mr Wilhelm. So if you have a problem with that, maybe you should just take it up with him.
I didnt say any other bawdy things.
Why?
Perhaps.
I didn't know whether to try and keep her from falling, or zip up.
...so mind you, at this point I'm only going out with her two or three weeks. So she goes out of town and she asks me to feed her cat. So at this time, there's a lot of stuff going on in my life and, uh, it slips my mind for a few days. Maybe a week. Not a week, five, six days.
When you're playing the piano do you think about me?
What red dot? What are you talking about? Jerry come here for a second. Do you see anything here?
I could go bumper to bumper with any one else on this planet!
Why can't we do this on the phone? What's Kramer doing now?
Kramer, what the hell are you talking about?
Maybe Im right? Of course Im right.
So what? Somebody dropped an egg on my head as I went into my building last night.
He's with the touring company of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. He's the guy in charge of the wigs.
Really good?
Not in the last fifteen minutes.
Boy!
Where we gonna eat?
"No!...not...nothing."
Ask about you, ask about you.
When?
I'll tell ya, if I ever get out of here, I'm gonna change my life. I'm gonna do a whole Zen thing. Take up yoga, meditate.. I'll eat right. Calm down, lose my anger.. (Sees Jerry and Elaine aren't listening. He snaps) Hey, is anybody listening?!
"Hey"
It's just a magnificent stone. (turns to Jerry) Jerry?
You're not really gonna go to California, are you?
I think I got it. How 'bout this? How 'bout this? We trade Jim Leyritz and Bernie Williams, for Barry Bonds, huh? Whadda ya think? That way I have Griffey and Bonds, in the same outfield! Now you got a team! Ha ha ha.
People can drop change down here, Jerry. And theyre too lazy to pick it up.
Hi,
No. I--I paid for it.
Elaine.
Someone's have to unhook the boat before it leaves...the place!
(Letting his conscious get the best of him) I wonder how Susan's father's going to react to this. Alright, what- what's the worst he could do? So you burn a cabin down..
Good. Cause if this is a lie, if this is a joke, if this is your idea of some cute little game we're finished!
Well, maybe so...but it was good enough for Mr. Jon Voight.
So?
(yells) Wow! Who put this cup right on the new table!
(getting annoyed) Hang on, it's warming up!
Jerry, the Mets lost.
What are all sweatin' for?
I still haven't figured him out.
Well, it was slightly used...
THIS is your daughter? My God! My God! I I hope you don't mind my saying. She is breathtaking.
A guy leaves a puddle of sweat, that's a signal?
No, no, Hey I'll get it. What's in the BIG salad?
What?
I didn't shave this morning. I don't feel like myself.
Well, not really. After all, she did get together with George Peppard. I mean, Fred.
Why don't you find a doctor that doesn't know your difficult.
That's your boyfriend.
She's been locked up for two years. She's gonna want to make up for lost time. Dinners. Movies. (Rubs his forehead.) Talking...
What am I scared of? I'm scared of the same thing that you are, everything! Why don't you just use your own name?
And on your dates.
Have you ever had their egg salad?
Why should she like me? Who am I? Huh, there's a million people to like.
Yeah, there was a fire in my apartment.
You think your parents would have any objections to taking a little kid to Paris with them? (Jerry looks at him confused) It turns out that the kid's father lives in Paris. (chuckling) Is that a coincidence? (Jerry smilies) Eh you know Alec wants me to take him over there so I figure as long as they're going (claps)
Hi! Mr. West, this is my friend Elaine--
Yeah.
I said, would you like to go for a walk or something.
(we hear him think) My friends are idiots, she doesn't look like Jerry. She doesn't look like anybody. And so what if does look like Jerry,what does that mean?. That I could have everything I have with Jerry but because it's a woman I could also have sex with her....And that somehow that would be exactly what I always wanted.....She doesn't even look like Jerry..
This is not a Metallica concert, it?s an opera alright, a little dignity, a little class, just give me my ticket, I will stand over here and sell it.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. You can't say anything. (rushes to take phone from Jerry)
Can't find them. That's marvelous. The dance continues.
Yeah, maybe. (snifs)Where'd you get that?
They were right outside!
(annoyed) Not a peep. They just cleaned the carpets and left. Call themselves a cult!
Yeah, why? Why?
No way.
Yes she is. It's a pity we won't be seeing much more of her.
Not at all.
I don't want to talk about it.
I was squinting! Remember that drive from Wortsborough? (snapping his fingers) I was spotting those raccoons.
Oh! That's good judgment. That's a pile of judgment there. Sure.
No, Jerry, don't call.
Hey! Surprise, surprise!
(Irritated) It's called a T-square.
I suppose he's an attractive man, I ,
He's getting phone calls here now? (he's standing near the counter and eating chips out of a big bag)
Don't you see what this says? How can you possibly like somebody ,if you think they look like this?
Oh.
Yeah, of course she did. That's all I ever heard growing up is 'Why can't you be more like Lloyd Braun?' Did you know he was in a mental institution?
The story is the foundation of all entertainment. You must have a good story otherwise it's just masturbation.
Yeah, it's her uncle's.
You don't like the move?
Yeah! You're right.. You're probably right.
What was wrong with that sorry? It was a good sorry. Jerry, was that a good sorry?
It seemed so disorganized.
Oh, I understand. (George exits; Sees Kramer in the hallway) Hey.
Really?
(knocks on the window) Hey, why are all those people milling around my car?
We ordered the wedding invitations today,, Nothing can stop it now. Nothing. It's here! It's happening. Can I do this? I can't do this...Look at me. Look at me I can't do this, I can't do this (manic) Help me Jerry, help me.
..Okay.
Well that's the gist of it!
This bread has nuts in it!
She never came back from lunch.
Things are good.
I'd love to be a Civil War buff. ... What do you have to do to be a buff
Okay.
The parakeet in the mirror. That's a good one, Stu.
Oh yeah. My friend lived there.
Hey, look at this. This is the same massage chair we're gettin' for Joe Mayo, $60 cheaper.
Come on, lets not stand here too long, we might run in to her.
Kramer, what the hell are you talking about?
No, no...
Ow! .. Ow! I give, I give! Uncle!
Well not really...
WOW!
"Why would George steal from the Yankees?"
(angry that she believes Al was right) No he's not right. Al Netchie is not right! Alright I'm canceling the father-son picnic. I don't know what he's gonna do with all that potato salad.
Oh, it was. But he claimed it was a 5th Avenue bar.
Look, Deena, I know you think I'm crazy, but I'm not. This is just a series of bad coincidences.
Yes!
You got your own shampoo, conditioner, body lotion! Jerry, body
He's extremely Murphy. He's Murphy to a fault.
I didnt think ahead.
Yeah. Hey, wait a second, you know, good news for you too. Susan's best friend, Hallie? Broke up with her boyfriend.
Did I need that pointed out for me? What is that going to do for me? How does that help me, to see her? I'm trying to live my life. Don't show me that.
You faked?
I zipped up!
Hey by the way my parents really want to have your parents over dinner before they leave town.
I'm not stealing it. They owe me ten dollars. They stole from me.
Really? At the tennis match?
I kept looking at her face. Id go, Cmon, love her. Love her!
What happened to you?
How so? I'll tell you how so. She's bald!
Well, don't they make a counter offer? How can they just cancel the whole deal like that? What kind of a maniac is this guy? I mean he just, he says no, and that's it?
Well, sure. They're Jewish, and you're a shiksa.
Yeah, yeah. I see the irony. All right. What about this? What if I can find some way to break up with her so that she'll still like me and it doesn't affect the deal.
So we pick up some (word missing)
Yes, flowers. I will get her flowers, I will go to the florist!
Right, right.
A little breakfast.
No, no, no, this suit is not for sale. (tries to take off the suit from the guy)
Now, because of that stupid rye bread, I gotta keep them all separated for the rest of my life.
Yeah, so?
What?
Hey, I just found twenty dollars! I tell you this, something is happening in my life. I did this opposite thing last night. Up was down, black was white, good was -
Hes a cube. Anyway, he got married six months ago. He told me ever since hes been wearing a wedding band, women have been coming on to him everywhere he goes.
(leaving) Hah. Good luck.
Wow! Heh. (Half kidding) You don't, huh, have a replacement lined up for me, do ya? heh he he he he he...
What did you go out with me for?! Just to dump chocolate on my shirt and then just dump me altogether?! I don't deserve that kind of treatment! What, you don't have the common courtesy to return my calls?! To apologize! You think I'm some sort of a loser, that likes to be abused and ignored?! Who's shirt can be ruined without financial restitution?! Some sort of a masochist who enjoys being humiliated? You think you can avoid me like I have some sort of disease?! You have the disease! You have the disease! You may be beautiful and rich and physically .. just .. unbelievable, but you sicken me! You disgust me! You and everyone like you!
They're -- They're killing independent George! And they're, they're all in on it! World's are colliding!
Did she show her breasts in that?
I'm sorry. I can't live knowing Ted Danson makes that much more than me. Who is he?
Regards?
It never ends, this present stuff! Engagement present! Then they get married, you gonna have to get them something for that! Then the baby, there's another present. Then the baby starts getting their presents. I don't even like Drake.
B-O-Z-O?
What do you need her for? There's a million lawyers.
Isn't polite to say Hello when somebody says hello?
What are you, a doctor?
Too bad , it's all done.
Kramer goes to a fantasy camp. His whole life is a fantasy camp. People should plunk down two-thousand dollars to live like him for a week. Do nothing, fall ass-backwards into money, mooch food off your neighbors and have sex without dating; that's a fantasy camp.
(trying to laugh it off) Right. C'mon! I'm having an affair with Elaine?! If I was having an affair with Elaine, I wouldn't tell you I'm going to see Elaine. I would make up some other person to tell you I was gonna go see, and then I would go see Ela..Elaine.
Is there any money involved?
Why?
I didn't.
Oh, you are such a wuss.
Because you called her by the wrong name.
Hey, listen don't oversleep. You can't afford to be late again.
Hey, there's a guy up the roof.
(to Elaine) He asked you to get the mail?
You see, this is what I do with women. I start out too strong, now I have to become real, that's when it all falls apart. What good is real? They don't want real, they want funny.
I tried to be nice. I wasn't nice?
You pick it.
Well just take an overview. Can't you just take an overview?
Pleasuring you?
The sea was angry that day my friends like an old man trying to send back soup in a deli!
I didn't even know it was a job.
Oh yeah, like you know.
Really?
Then I got off the phone right away.
Four hours.
Aah! the minute I saw this girl, we just clicked. She's got such a nice face. hummmm her eyes, her mouth, nose
It's, funny runnin' into you here.
He's actually doing him a favor. It's less money for him to buy food.
You can stuff your sorries in a sack, mister!
Maybe Karen is faking.
Okay. That's what we know.
(hurried) I'll see you.
Too good...
Yes.
Ah! Health's not good enough. I want more than health. Health's not doing it for me anymore. I'm sick of health.
Of course. Your massage. (winks) Enjoy your massage. (winks)
I know. I know.
Say you, me, and Kramer are, uh, flying over the Andes.
You haven't won. You may think you've won, but you haven't won. Do you know why? It's not over. This is not over. I'm not forgetting what's happening here. You have my ten dollars. I will get it back. Alright, don't worry. It's not over. I'm going now. Good bye. I will be back.
Yeah. She should be commending me for treating everyone like equals.
I'm sure you are.
Because I asked you to.
(sidling in) Is this a bad time? I hope I'm not disturbing anything.
Ask her about Kramer.
I'm getting nothing.
Yeah. Hey, let ask you something. Is it just me, or - or do you find it unbearable to be around Jerry and that girl?
How much?
I'll see you guys later.
No, Seven.
Shhh What is wrong with you? You never tell 'em you like the car. (Advising) You're not sure what you want. You don't even know why you're here.
Forget it? I already called my parents. I told them to expect the surprise of a lifetime. My mothers making her roasted potatoes!
Was it a scratch or a pick?
Like if she wants to know if I'm pleased with something, she'll say, "Happy, Pappy?"
Mine too.
I remember.. (Leaves)
A drafty apartment? A... sweaterless friend? A ball-game giveaway Metlife windbreaker?
Uh no no, shes working.
Hey Kramer.
What's all this?
It's exciting, isn't it? She's gonna have a whole new face.
That is so funny!
No.
The same outfit?
Well, it's a funny idea.
Hello, Lloyd. How you doing?
I don't want any mango.
Well this is bad. I am really in a bad situation now.
(broaching a subject) Hey mom. What kind of woman was grandma?
(entering Monk's) Hey.
Well, it's a good looking piece of meat. (laughs nervously) Wow, this is some place. A duplex, huh? (indicating) Look at this, you got stairs in an apartment. All my life, I dreamed about having steps in an apartment. Even one step. Sunken living room. Although, one step is really not all that sunken. (tries hard to elicit a laugh)
Yeah, you gotta do it classy (wipes his mouth to his sweater.)
Wait a second, wait. Why are we together?
She invited me up. Coffees not coffee, coffee is sex.
You mean just going there because I'm invited, that's rude?
(singing) Master of the house/Doling out the charm/Ready with a handshake and an open palm/Tells a saucy talk/Loves to make a stir/Everyone appreciates a...
Laguardia? All right, let's go. C'mon...
No, YOU do!
Thanks. What are you guys doin' here?
Sorry I'm late, but look what I found in the Yankee Hall of Pride display case.
Ah, would you take this picture away from me. Take it away and get it outta here. Let me just sign this and go.
Very exciting, very exciting, it's like watching a birth.
So, check out my view.
Nope. I wept like a baby.
Nine sixty? Give it to me.
Okay.
Can we go now?
I am? What a strange coincidence..
(shaking hands with Morty) Morty, always a pleasure.
I can't believe that you saw her before me.
No No I'm working on a system...Who was that?
Yes!
(excited) Did I tell you that story's relatable?! That was a great show! That is why I'm bringing it back to NBC.
Tommy C.
Keys. I can't find my keys.
I dont understand.
No! Theres no coconut!
Yeah!
She's not gonna like it.
Miss Rhode Island? When are you seeing her?
Yeah. I did some shopping. Some new clothes shopping. (turns to a man) Can I borrow your menu?
Parole! (Feigning joy) That's dynamite!
Well I've done that.
Phew!
(light) No. No, no, no. The cushion was turned over.
(coyly, he looks down and runs his finger along the top of the chair back in front of him) Do you, uh ... do you know what Im ... thinking about now?
The nice one that works in my office.
Please.
I can't go anywhere, I have to wait here for Tatiana's call. Let me just check.
(passes cane from right to left and back a few times) But, see here. Right. Wrong. Right. Wrong. Right. Right. Wrong--
Yeah, yeah, she's here.
You should see what my father used to go through before he bought a car. He'd go from state to state. He was away for weeks at a time. It was like he was running for President and he was going through the primaries. We'd get phone calls from motels in New Hampshire.
One, two ... three, four.
What happened to Mrs. Krantz?
It's all departures. I see nothing but departures. (to the woman beside him) Do you know where the arrivals are?
Yeah. So what happened?
What, you didn't ask him about the car?
Those are Susan's friends.
Wa, I'm not getting out of this cab
Just tell her whatcha want, they'll make it for ya.
What about the regards?
Alright, I'll tell you what you do. You call her back and give her the "it's me", heh? Pull the old switcheroo.
Eh, I can't. I gotta go down to the foundation. I'm interviewing high schoolers for the Susan Ross.. scholarship.
So?
Ah, shut up.
(Mutters) Oh.. okay.. talk to you later.
Oh, God.
Well Kramer's not an usher anymore.
No, no, no. Out of the question. I was over there today. He's got the good spot in front of the good building in the good neighbourhood. I know he's not gonna wanna move.
Hey, hey, hey! You don't call me back?!
It's Moops.
Uh, no, I, I dont think so.
Oh, the virgin?
There's gotta be more to life than this. What gives you pleasure?
Why don't you just ask him?
Have you seen Jerry? (sitting beside Elaine) I told him two o'clock.
Hey! Did 'ya ever do that thing on the toes that I said .
Jon Voight, the actor?
(Picking up the ketchup) What typical? Gimme typical. Gimme some typical.
We discussed toilet paper.
Well, we'll just see.
I bought a new recliner with a fridge build right in to it.
Tell me about it. I went out with this girl last week. First I had to pay for dinner, then--
Hi.
Exactly. (Sees an off-camera co-worker) Erica!
I'd like to sleep with a LOT of other women.
Yeah. I don't think they'll be able to tell.
Well have you got a picture?
(Anyway,) on the left--exquisite marble! High ceilings. An' a flush, like a jet engine! (imitates sound) Ha ha!
Maybe!.. And I'm moving back in there!
Not a bad way to make a buck.
Blanket.
(to Danielle) Whose cane is this?
Wed all go to movie on Friday?
Oh, I'll pay. Half-price. Arrivederci my fellow 40-short.
The Frogger is here.
What kind of money you think your parents have?
Oh boy.
I did, I'm trying to call China.
No, don't call her.
And I cancelled plans to go to the movies with them tonight.
What quit? (laughing) Who quit?
Oh I beg to differ. My father took great pride in his appearance, he was a very handsome man, a casanova really.
Need to use the phone.
My parents? They don't know *what's* goin' on...
Years. When we were kids, they made it seem like it was right around the corner.
No.
Oh. Really.
(Mutters) No, it's not.
Bye Mrs Seinfeld, take care.
What if I'm at the bottom?
Burned.
What?
Implied.
I think we got a bite on it. (Exits)
(sitting) So, guess where Mr 'Ocean phoned' turned up? He's working for Firestone, in Akron, Ohio.
Maybe you said something that offended her.
Uh, my speech?
All right, all right. KNOCK IT OFF. Come on, let's go.
No, no. No, no, no. (determined) We're staying on me. We haven't solved anything yet.
how did ya?...
yes?
Okay.
So, whaddya say? You know you'll always be the only man I'll ever love.
How do you suppose they did that?
A lot of people say it.
Well...maybe not as much as this bastard... (points at Zeke, they all laugh) I can hold my own! (they all continue laughing and drinking)
Neeson? How are you comparing Liam Neeson with Jon Voight? Jerry, we're talking about Joe Buck. If you can play Joe Buck, Oskar Schindler's a cake walk. (Opens the car door for Jerry, Jerry's about to get in.)
(to Jerry) How could we not hear anything? What's with this Russel? What's he doing? (Jerry raises his arms and shoulders like he doesn't know)
(on intercom) It's George.
Oh, don't tell me. Lloyd?
(shouts) Awright already!! This is a very key issue with me, Jerry. I had this name for a long time.
I never heard of that.
Do you feel funny? He didn't say anything.
Cause I tell you, frankly, I would like to walk in hear one day and find you sitting down. (Starts to walk out of the store) That would give me a lot of pleasure. Call me crazy.
Fifty-fifty.
Well was it a woman?
Hi, how are ya? (They kiss)
What?
It's the pesto of cities. So..?
And-and you just decided to pop in...!
Ah, a, You know what, maybe I'll just come ... umm, yummm (stammering)
The tag, huh?
Don't you understand? It's not about him. To have a line as perfect as 'jerk store' and to never use it. I, I couldn't live with myself.
Jerry. Marla. (Realizing Jerry's cue) Stacey! (Walks over to Stacey)
(Stern, trying to shut her up) Ma.
(Somewhat stern) Oh, the thing's cancelled. Sit down.
It's not funny, Elaine.
No, but Im very uncomfortable.
(frustrated) Ahh!
Why doesn't *he* pick you up after the operation. He's got the car with the bench seats that you like.
I can't do this! I can't do it. I have tried. I'm here. It's impossible.
I feel terrible, I can't be responsible for breaking up a marriage. Oh no (starting moving for the door, Elaine begins to stop him)
George, George Costanza!
How'd she find it?
Boy, I wish the flamenco was popular here.
UH, ha ha, ... It's just SO frustrating. It's a brand new jacket.
Ech. What else you got?
Who?
Is that so? Or could it be that you're just a *little* bit worried that you may have missed the boat?
(Laughs, snorts) I said, I said 'Get outta here! No story? Is that what I said?'
I dont know. But he aint funny.
Find a job. Get an apartment.
Kramer, please.
I... I... I long for you.
Bust of Nelson Rockefeller.
Well, we really should be-
oh,
And I'd like a discount.
You know, you're nuts with these sponges. George is gettin' frustrated!
Love to.
(he makes a sign to Jodi to wait and turns to Jerry) Jerry... This woman hates me so much. I'm starting to like her.
See, It's not so hard.
I did. I'm back. I love this relationship, I feel so liberated!
Yes?
Oy uy uy.. (Antonio points to the sink) We really should get going.
What, you don't like the name?
Why should I care?
What's with the gloves?
What for?
What's the massage situation?
Alright, still her father didn't have to throw me out like that, he could have just asked me to leave. The guy had me in a headlock! Susan's not going tonight you know.
What? Oh, My God!
Mr. Pensky. I was just working on your file. I was transferring the contents of the file into this flexible accordion-style folder.
A-ha, huh. (mumbles) tours.
Not as good. That's when you realize all the money you're losing.
I know that's why I bought `em but they're not comfortable.
Yeah.
You know what this means? I can't see her anymore either.
Well why don't you take off your hat and stay awhile.
(Still standing) So, you're gonna sit there?
(smiling) Ho ho. Funny. Isn't he funny? Funny guy. Ha ha ha.
Ma, people can hear you.
This you are not going to believe. Al Netchie, that pimple. Tells Daphne, not get this 'Not to get involved with me.'
Heh heh heh hey, new suit (raises coffee cup as a salute / toast)
(sighs) She called Susan last night.
Will you stop it?
Please.
I would like an apology.
I'm not going to break a hundred on this thing.
Oh, well...
Yeah, my roommate in college.
Yes, inte-- h-how inte-- how integral?
Moose?
Hello?
You miss her.
Because... you know...
I told her what a sexist he is. How he cheats on his wife.
You know, uh, she has no female friends! You know that, don't cha? Something strange about a woman whos friends are all men.
Why don't you just get some Ring Dings from the liquor store?
I can't believe this! What was wrong with it? What didn't you like about it?
Do you realize in the entire history of western civilization no one has successfully accomplished the Roommate Switch? In the Middle Ages you could get locked up for even suggesting it!
Big news?
(motioning Jerry to follow) C'mon.
Sorry. Thank you.
These are the balloons? Big deal, all I see is Woody Woodpecker.
As you will see, the candy bar is paid for, and yet, remains dangling in the machine. (Notices that the Twix slot is completely empty) Hey, its gone. Where is my Twix? (Quickly looks around. His sights fall on the window of a door labeled "Employees Only". The same mechanic from before is eating a candy bar) What?! That guys eatin it!
I got another meeting with Reilly. A whole new audience, and I bet I can get him to try that line again.
Rick.
What are you doing here?
And, it is all because of that car
Wait a minute. I must have been winking down at the office. That's why Mr. Wilhelm was acting so mysteriouso.
This is a crude mock-up of the conference room. 1/14th scale.
That, or Whos bra is this?
Yeah.
Ill have the tuna.
The table, the stereo, the VCR, the velvet couch, where's the velvet?
Why not?
Oh, yes. I - I'm your baby bluey.
Id like to have a kid. Of course, you have to have a date first... Remember my friend, Adam, from Detroit?
What about this weekend?
Coffees coffee in the morning. Its not coffee at twelve oclock at night.
Oh, the guy's got some perspective there.
Well I don't know anyone here Jerry. Where else am I going to stay?
Oh, sure. Sure, anything. Can you believe it? There's nothing wrong with me.
Well, it was a hell of a ride.
This pasta primavera is fabulous.
Regardless. I had to walk around for the rest of the party in some cheap Metlife windbreaker. Now, it is payback time.
Oh no, I am down!
She doesn't want to get a bra.
Faking? What makes you think that I have time to see doctors, take X-rays, make appointments, when there's absolutely nothing wrong with me? What kind of a person would do a thing like that?
Peterman? Nobody mentioned anything about Peterman.
(worried) Oh boy.
You got it.
Look, you wanna have sex right now? Do want to have sex with me right now? Let's go! C'mon, let's go baby! C'mon!
That's right, of the New York Yankees.
(pops his head out of the covers, looking a bit confused) Uh...you know, uh...pleasuring you.
"'Cause when he questioned me about it I was sweating from the Kom Pau.."
You know it must be impossible for a Spanish person to order seltzer and not get salsa. (Angry) "I wanted seltzer, not salsa."
Mario's Pizza.
Hello, Rick.
You're luscious. You're ravishing. I would give up red meat just to get a glimpse of you in a bra. Im terribly sorry. (both George and the attractive female applicant stand up as George reaches across the desk and shakes her hand for coming in)
You spoke to my mother?
Uh-hmm.
Oh, sorry.
Unsettling?
Hey, I work for Kruger Industrial Smoothing "We don't care, and it shows."
Oh, yeah, sure, accident, right. She was aiming right at me like she was putting out a fire! Then, for the rest of the show, I'm sitting there with chocolate all over my shirt. Flies are landing on me. I'm boiling - I'm fantasizing all the things I'm gonna say when I see her. And later, finally, backstage when I talk to her, I'm a groveling worm. "What kind of chocolate was that? Do you throw any other foods?"
I never heard of anyone would turned down an apartment because of a weak shower spray.
No, I saw "Home Alone II".
I bet they have more money than mine.
Hey, where you going?
You, uh, you like baseball? [picks up baseball from desk]
Yeah.
(To Susan) I told you it looked like her..
Yes a cruise, a long cruise, just the two of you.
They don't want to see me anymore!
Quick, what's your favorite animal?
Anywhere in the city - I'll tell you the best public toilet.
How good looking?
No, I uh...
Who was flirting with you?
Listen, Buck, I uh...obviously I don't need to talk to you about the importance of player morale, but uh...I've been talking to some of the guys, and some of them - I don't want to mention any names - but some of them...they're not too happy with the polyester uniforms.
I'm goin' in!
Who's he?
Laundry? Dry cleaning?
It doesn't matter if it's more comfortable. It's wrong.
What come on? Have you ever dated a woman that worked in your office?
I don't know. I don't wanna be one of those guys.
They are?... Elaine?
(Interrupting) May I?
You're considering hiring me for your latex salesman.
Good. Of course...
Yep, and the photo was all fixed and back on his desk, no thanks to you.
Oh, I find you so charming. You wuss.
There was an incident. I'd rather not discuss it.
Jerry, where did you get that sweater?
You know what I do at the Yankees, when one of these old guys is breathing down my neck?
(smiling) What about Sharon Besser?
(Definite) I'll take it in my room. (Walks off)
Okay, uh, eighteen dollars, and there it is. There you go. So maybe we could get together this weekend.
I don't have my ATM card.
You know, I could let it go for.. say.. a hundred and twenty-five.
Yes, yes, she had a nose job. I loved her very deeply. Will she ever speak to me again?
(anger) Well now it's not gonna be original! It's gonna lose all its cachet!
(nervous) Where are you taking me? I was gonna pay for it.
We got a chocolate malt in here!
If it makes you happy, I don't focus on these things. I will tell you this Unfortunately, we live in a very superficial society. I don't condone it, but it's a fact of life.
(hanging up) All right, Jerry. I'll do it. See ya.
(noticing something) Hey look, a dime.
Well, I'm, I'm just looking.
Would it kill him to check up on us? No - drops off the meals and that's it. I realize we're prisoners, but we're still entitled to catsup.
I can't believe they actually found your stolen car.
Of course I do.
How could you not know her name?
What, you think I'm doing material here?
Piece of cake; hu.
Well, I got just the thing to cheer you up. A computer! Huh? We can check porn, and stock quotes.
You know, the uh...(mutters it again.)
(con't) A-Anyway, I was thinking we would take two cars up to the cabin and that way if one of wanted to stay you know...
That's gotta hurt!
No! It, uh, it wouldn't fit you.
Yeah, he once bumped into reverend Yung Sun Moon.
Clothes shopping.
Oh, God...
Tell you what, I'll make a deal with you. I'll sell it to you right now for ten bucks.
Ma, don't cry!
How much are we gonna get for this? Fifty, sixty thousand?
Yes yes yes This is unbelievable.
Well, personal, I mean, we both uh...
From China. All the way from China.
No, I got my own place.
A preemptive breakup. This is an incredible idea. I got nothing to lose. We either break up which she would do anyway but at least I go out with some Dignity. Completely turn the tables. It's absolutely brilliant.
Oh uh hi Hi, David
Ha! (grabs his coat and exits the apartment)
Standard?
S, uh, Superman - he, uh, built the fortress of solitude up at the North Pole, to, uh, you know, sort of get away from it all..
Yeah, yeah, and we started talking, and she's this lawyer who's incredible! Everything I said was funny! You know, she laughed at everything I said, she thinks I'm hilarious. You know in a way, it was almost too good. I started so good, I can't go any place but down now, ya know? I got no place to go.
She said looks aren't important to her?
Hey, I saw what I saw.
Yeah, right.
What?
I don't even know her sister but believe me, if she's getting traffic tickets, she's not that good-looking! Woah
Out? Oh no, I've been to four other places, you're the only ones that have had it.
(shouting) Dee... Deena!
Jerry, this whole Ellen situation.. has gone far enough.
Well I I ..put a lot of thought into this and I think I would like you to sign a prenuptual agreement.
No, I don't have any change.
Yeah, my cleaning lady's Portuguese. I must've picked it up.
What for? . I'll tell you what for.... for hair.
Yeah.
I've got some plans. I got plans.
Lights out.
No kidding?
He's coming up?! (Moves to the door) I'll check you out later.
That's right.
(Asking Elaine) Jerry seem a little weird when I mentioned Nina?
I don't want it to feel good.
Of course! Alright, maybe I'll say something to Buck.
Yeah.
Is it flowing? I like flowing, cascading hair. Thick lustrous hair is very important to me.
In this scene my co-star who's right over here ( goes over to George who is still on the phone) Follow meeeee... is George Costanza, he plays an airline pilot who's just returned from Rome and I'm about to show him how much I've missed him.
You see? Now that is a handsome man. (Elaine and Jerry look right at George) Oh please.
Something, nothing, I could care less.
Yeah,yeah!! I'll pick you up right now.....All right All right....Hey! gotta go.
Let me just see it.
Now if you will kindly help me unwedge my front wheel, I'll be on my way.
Innocent mistake.
A different name for the butler? (Russell throws up again.)
OK Look, the gum isn't cutting it for me. We need to be about something else...anything..please.
Did he just steal the raisins?
Jerry and Elaine. They made me nuts.
This is a cartoon!
(sitting down next to Jerry) Seeing Maura. Apparently, I was unable to break up beyond a reasonable doubt.
Its my money. What should I do? Throw it out the window? I know a guy who took his vacation on his change.
Yeah. And since you go buy there everyday. I was hoping that we could help each other out.
Well so what's the problem, you just put some newspaper down.
(in the threshold between the living room and the kitchen) The thing that bothers me the most, is the lying.
Yeah.
You never had sex in the office before?
They have no friends.
I gotta buy a present now?
Why did France give that to us anyway?
Hi, how are you guys? Listen, does either one of you have like a mint or piece of gum or...
Wendy? Is that the uh, physical therapist?
(gleeful) Hehee. W..we could be like the Gatsbys. Didn't they always like, you know, a bunch of people around, and they were all best friends?
Pardon me, I went to see your friend Dwayne... there was no discount.
It would have been nice if someone told me about it. I just think you could have said something. That's all.
I could have had some ice cream. I think that might have calmed down the nachos.
Thats it.
What are you up to now, uh, Step Nine?
What?
What?
What kind of a shake does he have?
Christie? That's the one you met in the antique store?
Well, who is she?
Maybe they forgot to put it out!
Me? I didn't say anything.
Can you do it?
What?
March 21st. Hey! So, you're gonna back me on this, right?
Gee, that's-that's too bad.
No-no-no, we all chipped in. We have the money.
Yes!
Don't you see what it says here? Don't you understand what that's implying?
Percentage?
Yeah.
(points) And him!
You mean that's true, I'm right?!
No! Get out of here, Newman.
I had a little tiff with Bonnie about the roommate.
What?! Why?
Forget Gammy.
I dont understand why you spend time with this guy.
Oh, yes I am. Mr. Thomassoulo likes to play dirty. Well, theres nothing dirtier than a giant ball of oil.
Oh, here we go...
No details?
Ah, Pfft! What can you do? (looking at a tag on the suit) Is this the price tag?
Alright so you made out with someone.
No. I did.
Nice meeting you.
So what're you gonna do?
I am never saying 'I love you' again unless they say it first.
I just feel terrible This is just terrible.
(whispering) I can't explain. It's very important that I sit here.
How much money d'you think they have?
Yes.
I'm losin' it
What?
No, you go Guggenheim. I'm not much of a Guggenheim.
Oh!, so what. I'd rather she hate me and thought I was good looking....At least I can get somebody else. (scratching his chest) What is this? Why am I itching?
Hello?
Uh, we're cool. Everything's cool (to security attendent)
(impatient) For her. Not for you.
Well, unless you tell everybody you're dating.
Oh - comfort, schmomfort. Listen, Father, can I ask you a question? In a terrible time like this...who would I get the death certificate from?
(smiling) So, you know, what, what happened?
What did he give you for it.
This is very hard to follow with all the talking.
(frustrated) Oh, look at this. There's no place to park around here. I don't even know why they sell cars in Manhattan.
Are you going to help me or not?
I know. I just sort of leaned on it so it would look like it was mine.
(gritting teeth) Yeah, sure.
Hi, I need some party invitations.
It'll be different this time.
Betsy.
You're in the movie? Is he in the scene?
...ah (picks up the bag) Damn salami.
We just came from Chadway's(?) What's going on.
Grateful? How can you be grateful when you're *so* close to the end? When you know that any second-- Poof! Bamm-O! It can all be over. I mean you're not stupid, you can read the handwriting on the wall. It's a matter of simple arithmetic, for Gods sake...
Well you didn't have to say it like that.
I am such a Huge whale fan. These marine biologists were showin' how they communicate with each other with these squeaks and squeals, what a fish!
Why can't I have a heart attack? I'm allowed.
You gotta give us odds. At least two to one - you gotta put up two-hundred dollars.
Well, uh... come in, come, come in. (frantically clears the couch of newspapers and crumbs)
No, no, no, I dont want to carry it around all night. Ill pick it up later.
Hotel.
I dont know how you put up with this.
(phone rings ,picks up) Operator? Beijing?
Yes, I've seen a silver dollar.
(entering Jerry's apartment) Jerry?
Dinner? (grabs Kramer)
You don't think I can?
Maybe I could move them until you get back.
(bemused) Really?
You don't understand, there's a *blurb* about me in this magazine!
Well, this I take to the grave.
Because I cant call a woman with other people in the room. Come on, lets go.
Let me put that on speaker phone.
Thanks a lot. Ill give it back to you in a week.
No? Are you crazy?
SHEILA!!!
(Acting innocent) I'm all set.
I hope I am.
(laughs hysterically, gesticulating wildly) This is all blowing up in my face! My serious girlfriend, and my torrid love affair have accidentally crossed paths. I have ruined three lives... (grabbing coat) Well, I understand if you never want to see me again, so... (points towards door)
You got that from Elaine.
The sex wasn't so good?
Yes they did. I was covering. Elaine has been deported back to Scotland.
(from the street below Jerry's window) Jerry!
Exactly! You know how they get animals to reproduce in captivity? They just put them in the same cage.
Slippery Pete?
(penny drops) Oh, uh, wait a minute, wait a minute. (snorts) Is this about money?
Because, I've got the coat. I can sit in the car and not get cold.
No, thanks.
".....Well. I'm sorry. Call you right back."
What could I do?! We fooled around and went to a movie!
Probably. They all do. In my high school, half my graduating class had them. Of course, I'm from Long Island, so...
I know.
(Not sure what the answer should be) What do you want to hear?
Yeah, right.
Three days. Well, maybe you caught her on the cusp of a new wash cycle. You know, she did laundry the day after she met you, everything got clean and she started all over again.
Yes, it was very, very good.
I put my pants on, Sid.
(breaks a long silence) The uh, the shoe laces that you bought me, they uh, they worked out well. (thumbs up)
I'm making it up.
..That.
Yes, I, uh, I need to return this book.
No, no. I'm just thinking.
Marla.
(takes a bite) Oh, that's good. That's very good.
You go over there -
You could pet them. They come right out of the water onto the sidewalks.
I can't believe it. He's going! He's fired!
Was this something you had planned for a while?
Hey, last night, I found a whole Weeble Village right behind the EZ Bake oven.
I think it's "on the wagon".
'Cause Neil Watkins from accounting is T-bone!
The uniforms! Did you see how they played? Listen to these comments! (reads from the paper) "Wade Boggs 'What a fabric! Finally we can breathe.' Luis Palonia 'Cotton is king.' Paul O'Neill 'I never dreamed anything could be so soft and fluffy.' "
You sure?
You think so?
The old man got to me.
No.
So how was it?
Joe...could you...
Nothing. It's a card from my dad.
(playing with toys) Ahhhh, Yes! Touch down! Your turn, Jerry. (hands Jerry the Mattel Football. George starts playing with the Etch-a-sketch.)
That's why I peeked. (Jerry opens the door to take some trash out, and meets Kramer and Gail in the hallway.)
Who?
What's she like? Impressive?
I don't even like to sit next to a man on an airplane 'cause our knees might touch.
What about the mail?
Oh, its a lovely song. (singing) How do you solve a problem like Maria?...
No, I know I don't have to, I want to.
I'm not gonna give you my card unless you tell me what it's for!
Yeah, yeah, right here. (hands it to him)
Yes, two solariums. Quite a find. And I have horses, too?
Hello? I can take an hour off your hands. Give the kids a chance to see a real live Yankee.
You never run out, do you? (Jerry smiles.) Where's Kramer? Everything's finished here.
What's it gonna be? ... You hear that?
I was just blowin' off a little steam. So what?
I didn't encourage. No encourage.
Alright, maybe I do. So what.
What if I want to walk around a little?
Yea.
Lena, how'd you meet her?
Yes, hello. Party's over. (taking off the suit)
What does that mean?
Well... what if you showed up bad naked, huh? You still got that belt sander?
(desperate) Steinbrenner had me committed! I'm in the nuthouse!
I got to give the players most of the credit for that.
I doubt it. You know what he's doing now? He's putting a pool table in my old bedroom.
Oh. That's good.
Yeah, you know we spoke for a little bit...
Till I'm comfortable.
Well you missed a lovely little party that we had for Grace.
How you doing?
Who's he?
Right.
Will you shut up?!
100 p.m. Do you need any money?
I still won't be able to forgive myself - but at least it won't be about this.
It is a horrible company. There's no management what so ever. I could go hog wild in there.
Donna. Oh, youre the one that likes that commercial!
You know, I haven't eaten anything.
Well, they gave birth to me, and, yada yada...
She put them in her pocketbook. I guess she took them with her.
What kind of plastic do you think it is? What do you think like that dry cleaning plastic?
No, I froze.
Uh, please, Morty.
(shaking his head, weary) It doesn't matter. (he leaves)
(looking uncomfortable) Um... yeah! Sure, sure I'm interested.
(to Jerry) Ready?
Yeah, yeah. That's how they talk in the major league. (laughs)
Well, I feel better already. I'm feelin' like a good person.
I'll give you a quarter.
Why not?
How about Bozo?
(thinking) This guy's perfect.
(big smile) Eight thousand dollars.
Oh no, Morgan is a good man sir.
So you didn't turn her in?
You saw Jane topless?
Well, what is it?
You can see the Cayman Islands in there? Is something going to happen to me? What?
Like this.
We gotta get something. I don't want to go to that meeting on an empty stomach. Let's get some Chinese. You wanna order it?
Id like a doggie bag for this please. (hands her plate to the waitress)
yeah!
(double takes) What's that?
Oh, yeah?
All right, I gotta get going. My parents are expecting me.
Hello Stu.
I-I don't know.
You've got a prayer.
Ah... (quietly)
Let me tell you something about that tag. It's no 31, and uh...let's just leave it at that.
Shst, You should take the test for me.
You never played Vegas.
Lyndon Johnson was uglier than Degaulle.
The Switch?
Yes.
(horrified) But that meeting starts in ten minutes!
That's right. It's just me and her.
I feel alive, Jerry.
It's huge!
(on an imaginary microphone) Uh, no, not at this time.
Wait a minute, wait, it's not that stupid.
So I'm dressing and she's staring up at me, struggling to compute this unprecedented turn of events. I don't know what to say to reassure this woman, and worst of all, I don't have the time to say it. The only excuse she might possibly have accepted is if I told her I am in reality Batman, and I'm very sorry, I just saw the Bat-Signal. It took me 3 days of phone calls to get her to agree to see me again. Now she's waiting for me to call her, and she's
O.k....(thinks) I think I know where we can get one.
Fired? Why?
I don't know.
Daphne. I have to tell you something, this is very difficult...
What am I going to do now? I can't live without Susan. I gotta get her back. How? How, am I gonna get her back?
Why is nice bad? What kind a of sick society we are living in, when nice is bad?
Yeah. So how does that help me?
I should probably get going too. If I don't feed Pequita by seven, she goes all over everything.. take it easy.
What exactly is mutton?
Yeah. What time is it?
Dad, the hinges are all rusted here. That's why the wind keeps blowing the door off.
Happy Festivus!
I should've hit the little son-of-a-bitch. I can't stand kids. Adults think it's so wonderful how honest kids are. I don't need that kind of honesty. I'll take a deceptive adult over an honest kid any day.
You know we're living in a society!
Oh, I had it perfectly timed out the Grand Central, the Van Wyck! You destroyed my whole timing!
That's right. You ready?
(pulling out some money) Uh, yeah. Hang on. Just... yeah.
I don't know if you're ready for it.
(surprised) You know her name?
Could I, uh, could I trade you for another dollar?
Hey.
Oooh.
(Starting to panic again) What? Oh my God. What? Is it meningitis? Scoliosis? Lupis?! Is it Lupis?!
Hand modeling? (Shakes his head 'No')
Yeah, take it easy.
Who's Bozo? Bozo the Clown, that's who Bozo is. When I was a kid, Bozo the Clown was the clown, bar none.
Is that how you're gonna say it?
What...are you using my babies now?
She had to be impressed by that conversation, had to! It was a great performance. I am unbelievable on the phone. On the date they should just have two phones on the table at the restaurant, done.
I never assisted in a birth before. Its really quite disgusting.
Did you explain to her about the good naked and the bad naked?
Yeah well, they won't know. I got the car there.
A pack of teenagers?
I've tried. We don't have it. But maybe the two of us, working together at full capacity, could do the job of one normal man.
So, what, no lunch?
Yeah, see, uh, when we met, I was over there and, uh, you were over here, so the image, uh, the image was reversed, like, uh, like in the mirror.
All right there you go. It's a '47 cabin all right. So, we'll see you tomorrow.
Two-man? It's all me. Kruger doesn't do anything; Disappears for hours at a time, gives me fake excuses. This afternoon I found him with sleep creases on his face. The only reason I got out to get a bite today was that he finally promised to buckle down and do some actual work. (turning around, George sees Mr. Kruger at a booth eating a piece of cake) Oh, I don't believe this. This is what I have to put up with, Jerry. (He walks over) Mr. Kruger? Who said he was going to do some actual work today? Who?
What do you think I mean bald? Bald. Bald bald.
Yeah, that was enough.
You took me to one of your shows..
No. That's not that.
Come on you're... uh... you're fine.
I've just met her but I'm very impressed.
Dr. Sitarides don't go! Oh, thanks Jerry!
(still quiet) Never mind, never mind. I need you to do me a favour. Uhm, remember what we were talking about at the coffee shop earlier?
That's what she says. I say, listen. It was an old cat. It died of natural causes. So get this, now she tells me that I gotta buy her a brand new cat. I say listen, honey. First of all, it was a pretty old cat. I'm not gonna buy you a brand new cat to replace an old dying cat. And second of all, I go out to the garbage, I find you a new cat in fifteen seconds. I say, you show me an autopsy report that says this cat died of starvation, I spring for a new cat. So she says something to me, like, uh, I dunno, get the hell out of here, and she breaks up with me. Now don't you think that would be a great case on L.A. Law?
Mister Fowler, I-I have a squirrel here that is a miracle of modern science! (laughs)
Which one?
I love when they touch your arm. I can't get enough of that. Why is that?
No seriously...
(Getting in a more panicked state) Oh God, Mommy!
He sold me ladies' glasses!
I'm sorry, Jerry I can't help you.
I'm just happy to be working with your talented son...
You don't work in the rain? Your a mailman."Neither rain nor sleet nor snow....."It's the first one.
He might as well have! I caught him, and his face was covered in chocolate and cookie crumbs.
You're you.
Okay.
You know what? I think this Ruthie Cohen gave me the wrong change. Didn't I pay with a twenty? I'm sure I paid with a twenty.
She thinks I'm a nice guy. Women always think I'm nice, but women don'tnice.
(Looking at his finger) I think somethin bit me. I just need another nickel.
Hey, Nina! (beat) I owe you some money, don't I?
It's more than the meal!
Well, I wanna talk to him about this.
This woman left this really sexy message on Jerry's tape recorder......
She's right, I heard Kramer got mugged out on the suburbs on a baby-sitting gig.
What do you mean you didn't think I wasn't gonna use them?!
Yeah, right.
I'd rather go to a hanging.
Yeah, listen, I can't make it later.
(Talking it) Im here helpin you.
So?
No no.
You see those tears streaming down you don't know what to do. It was like she was on fire and I was trying to put her out.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
And ah, Ill have the bacon club without the turkey. (raises eyebrows)
Oh. It's just horse manure (huh huh - laughs, he points back at the horse that walked by) Horse manure's not that bad. I don't even mind the word manure. You know, it's, it's nure, which is good. and a ma in front of it. MA-NURE. I mean when you consider the other choices, manure is actually pretty refreshing.
Oh my!
And then, then, then she leaves with somebody else! Never even, never even said goodbye! Never called me back.. Never apologized. Nothing. Like I was dirt.
Don't jinx it! Don't jinx (trails off quietly in elation)
Just give it a little more time.
Sorry.
you said "step off"? wow, that is too much hey..huh hey (George turns the cap his wearing backwards like Tony) Tony, I huh, I just had this brainstorm for us. Can you guess what it is?
So, much longer?
Peter, Paul and Mary.
Hey.
No, not really.
(quiet) Uh-oh.
Nah, with crutches it's a funny story, with a cane it's a sad story. You through with those?
Hello, friend. Enjoying the flight?
Hey pop, would you buzz off, I've got something cooking.
Huh, he's a communist. . . . Look at this. "Exciting uninhibited woman seeks forward thinking comrade and appearance not important." . . . Appearance Not Important! This is unbelievable. Finally this is an ideology I can embrace.
Hey.
Oh, this isn't even B.O.! This is *beyond* B.O.! It's *B*.B.O.!
What, you're gonna pass up a wonderful opportunity to put that aloe pusher in her place?
Cheryl, Elaine, and uh, Jerry.
I thought you said he was gonna get a muffin.
You're not going to get back here in time!
What, did you go swimmin'? It's 29 degrees out!
A man gave me...
My hand is out.
The security guard.
Good to see you again.
I think it moved.
That's what I'm afraid of. You know Mr. Steinbrenner, . . .
Gwen really wants to go.
huh Kramer it's huh.. gonna be pretty dangerous up there
Uh-huh.
Ah, I guess I should go up and apologize.
Yeah.
(still by the door) What? M-Maura, what are you doin' here? I ended this relationship... twice!
Oh, pretty good.
Yes. Well...
That's funny. You're a funny guy.
I want you to find out is she likes me.
Well, sorry I missed that, uh, charity thing. But this was one of those truly glorious Hampton weekends that you always hear about.
Where's uh, where's Allison..
I havent seen it yet, but its a two-bedroom, its on the uh, west 83rd, bout a half block from the park?
What do you mean?
No, no, I mean, driving Susan to lesbianism.
It says very clearly, 'for your protection, do not give your secret code to anyone.'
Yes. Why, is that so inconceivable?
Just take it off. I'm getting hot just looking at it.
Nine minutes.
No, no, no. He just left.
No, no, she might just think its a gift.
There's no house! It's a lie! There's no solarium. There's no Prickly Pete. There's no other solarium.
Well, no.
Barry?
Alright, so, we need something..
A biopsy!
I wouldnt think so.
Ah, get outta here. The vomiting is much funnier.
What, do you pay him for that?
I'll try a piece.
I didn't say 'We're Ted Danson.'
No, no, no. Just lately, I've been thinking a lot clearer. Like this afternoon, (To television) what is chicken Kiev, (Back to Jerry) I really enjoyed watching a documentary with Louise.
Wha... you're going?
Ah, this is the kind of day that almost makes you feel good to be alive.
You want me to ask one of the Yankees.
No.
What?
Yeah?
What? The guy asked you to HELP HIM MOVE? Wow.
I shouldn't even tell you this.
Well, I'm also an architect. Is that pastrami?
(to Kramer) You got a job?
Well, I was 14 years old. I was in my friends bathroom. His mother's brassieres were hanging on the shower rod and I picked it up, studied it. I thought, I like this. I didn't know what way or what level, but I knew I wanted to be around brassieres.
[to himself] Oh, my God! It's Susan! What do I do?
I mean, now she thinks that I'm one of these guys that love her. Nobody wants to be with somebody that loves them.
It's over, Jerry. She's gettin' out.
Oh, no. No no no no.
Yeah, thanks.
uh.. maana? huh maana might.. huh maana might be a problem, I'm supposed to have huh a boil lanced maana. Huh you know I think they charge me if I cancel with only one maana's notice
.....So what's your point?
Let's work on the card.
Well, Jerry doesn't want anyone to know.
Alright the administrator's on the third floor. I'll meet you guys back at the car.
Alright, here we go. You got it?
And in bed--
This is George Costanza, I'm calling for my test results. Negative? Oh, my God. WHY! WHY! WHY? What? What? Negative is good? Oh, yes of course! How stupid of me. Thank you. Thank you very much. (he hangs up)
(forced buoyancy) Hey, you know, let's call Susan, we'll go have coffee.
(delighted) Jerry? It was incredible! Models! As far as the eye could see!
Who's going to bomb you. An airline for all the stupid little peanut jokes.
Excuse me, I'm expecting a call. Costanza?
They're for protection, Jerry. Can you tell where I'm lookin'?
What are you doing? You're robbing me?
Of course he should consider it, but now is not the time!
I've been standing here for the last ten minutes!
Ah, listen ah, I don't mean to bother you but ah, silly me, I- I think I may have left my hat in your apartment. So ah, I thought I'd just come by later and pick it up.
But you are Blanche... You *are* in the shackles. Oh, I can't wait to read my *Time* magazine! Laaaast copy, too. Maybe I'll read it tomorrow-- in the park! It's supposed to be a beeyootiful day! Have a nice life... sentence, that is!
Where's the food? What happened to Ping?
Great, great. So anytime you want you can just visualize her naked.
Yesssss.
Would I want to see what Mary Todd wore to Lincoln's funeral?
Well, they hurt him bad. Really hurt his feelings. It's a long story. I- I don't like to talk about it, but I swore then that I would never work for big broker-houses. See, all they care about is money. I'm about more than money, I'm about people, always gone my own way and I've never looked back.
Oh sure, sure. You wanna be alone, sure. I understand that, you wanna a little time to think uh thing..ponder things..you know..ruminant..(chuckles) you go ahead, lotta stuff on your mind..you think things out..Think, mull, mull, do a lot of mulling. (short laugh then exits Monk's)
Okay, okay. Look, you do all the talking, okay?
What are ya doing?! Whadya, crazy?!
(Quick, excited talking) Hey, hey! You can't believe this. Look at this check! (Hands it to Jerry) They told me I had the most beautiful hands they'd ever seen in their lives - except for this McKigney guy - this great looking girl gave me her phone number.. I got it! I got it all! I'm busting. Jerry, I'm busting!
Manhattan Memorial, less of a line.
(entering Jerry's bathroom) Well, Hanke's moved on to Step Ten. He was spotted taking personal inventory.
Well, I heard a noise.
What are these? (Holds test tubes to his head like antennae) Take me to your leader.
Yeah, I'm fine.
I was wrong, you were right.
Y'know, now you gotta ask her her name. It's so embarrassing.
(with a mouth full of food) This is good. Oh, this is good.
Of course. Absolute zero!
Hey, Tim. Quick question. Is it normal for your teeth to make noises, like a hissing or a chirping?
You wanted to see me, Mr.Steinbrenner?
Youre not getting no Drakes Coffee Cake for fifty cents. Yae, Hey, Im all set. I got the ticket. Im going to the Cayman Islands this Friday.
You know, you're going along, you think everything's all right and all of a sudden you get that tap. (George taps his own shoulder). You know it's like pfffff (whistling sound), all right that's enough, you're through.
Moisturizer?
So?
Yes. Yes. Care. You know who I think about a lot? Remember SUSAN ? The one that used to work for NBC?
I thought were a team.
Yea bye.
I think I had some hard candy in there.
That's the sign! The test; if a - if a man makes it move.
Yeah. I'll see you later.
What do you mean "into the patient"?
How do you know?
What?
Hey, Elaine. Maybe his girlfriend is Lois Loan.
Hey believe me, baldness will catch on. When the aliens come, who do you think they're gonna relate to? Who do you think is going to be the first ones getting a tour of the ship?
(screaming) Aaahh!!
It looks like it hasn't been washed.
All Simons was able to find out is that hes in the hospital.
(Puts his hands on his face, rubbing his eyes) Look. It's a skill, just like juggling. She probably enjoys showing it off.
Yeah, 5A!
It was more like a full bodied dry heave set to music.
Yes. Yes. You know what's interesting. The quarterback for the Atlanta Falcons is Bobby Hebert. No "r" which I find fascinating. You know it's Herbert h-e-r-b-e-r-t, Hebert h-e-b-e-r-t. "Hebert" it's a fun name to pronounce. Try and say it Hebert. Take a shot. All right. (check arrives) All right. I
So, how was the movie?
when did you get back?
It's a calzone, sir.
Please.
The Friars Club?
The locker room!
(pleased) I know.
Look...
Yes, you have to be Murphy.
How do you know it was her dude?
(casually) Sure, why not.
Listen, maybe we shouldn't start writing today. I got a lot on my mind.
(Still focused on the nudist) They're naked, the gardeners naked.. the bellhops. (Jerry makes a noise of astonishment) One big nude-a-rama.
What I don't get is, just because the battery is dead, you think she'd be able to roll up the hill with her hands!
Oh my God, an affair. That's so adult. It's like with stockings and martinis, and William Holden. On the other hand it probably wouldn't cost me any money.
The death certificate?
Is it about me?
You already have an in. You have the same first name!... (no reaction) 'Jerry'!
(Holding camera) Look at this, I only have one picture left... How 'bout a shot of me and Mr. Morgan?
Oh, boy. Here she comes.
And you threw it out the window?
Oh. Who is this guy?
Well the sex was okay, but I threw up from the Hennigans.
What, Minelli's!?!
Whooo.. (To a waitress taking orders) Ooh.. French fries.
you know, just by conversing, you can really learn a lot about a person.
how did I know you were here? Something drew me here. This is phenomenal.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. As long as youre going to lie to the guy, why dont you tell him that you lost both of the tickets, then we can go?
Didja see the way she was looking at me?
You sure?
You got bumped from career day?
Oh, uh, the cigars.. (Chuckles nervously) I'm, uh, suckin' 'em down. I'm puffing my brains out, yeah.
Hey!
Yea they're making Paella.
Well I can't break up with her now.
I just can't believe at the way people are. What is it with humanity? What kind of a world do we live in?
You know, I used to love Paris. My uh, dead Fiance, Susan.. (opening wallet) In fact I. think I, I may have a picture of her..
Yeah, sure.
I suppose I could just pull this out ( his tucked shirt)and walk around like this and you wouldn't care?
Aren't those the guys that always go crazy and come back with a gun and shoot everybody?
I guess you two are the lucky ones.
Tell you about the Portuguese waitress.
(Like a kid) Because I don't want to.
That's what they tell me!
What are you doing here? I thought you said you hated Isabella's?
And maybe we could go out and do something.
Hid? I have no idea how this suit got misplaced. Nevertheless, I do believe I shall purchase it.
Ah, Just double park.
Behind the dugout, that's where we were sitting the other day.
Are you through?
you put him on the spot
I can't believe you're not playing in cotton.
Hey hey.
Really?
How should I know?
Yeah, look at me. Now I GOTTA FIGURE OUT THE HAT SIZES OF 59,000 DIFFERENT PEOPLE!! WHAT IF A PINHEAD SHOWS UP. I GOTTA BE ON TOP OF THAT.
No, you didn't mention it.
You think this is the plane that Ted Danson gets?
I don't understand. Paper Machay hats?
(waving) How can I not think about it? Look at the size of this thing.
What about the dolphins? You could swim with the dolphins down there.
I dont know what the hell I said. I gave her an ultimatum and theres nothing I can do. Its a machine. The little light is blinking right now, Come and listen to the idiot. Hey everybody, the idiots on!
You're going like that?
If you want.
I, uh, should have a poem very soon now.
(startled) Oh!
Maybe it's some small thing I could change. Like a moustache. Or wearing a top hat, or a monocle, or a..or a cane.
I can't believe, you're blaming Lupe?
I can't take it anymore! I'm going to work! ARe you happy now?! (Gathers his things, and runs out of the coffee shop. Elaine and Jerry laugh hysterically)
"To the victor goes the spoils." What are you going to do tonight?
"All right, I'll see you guys later."
It's not really a mental institution. It's more like a depression clinic. She went out to Woodhaven and checked herself in. I'm, I'm sick over this.
Well, how good a look did you get?
No, you didnt!
Zing.
My back is killing me.
Yea
Okay, what about a nice frame? With a picture of another guy in it. Frame says I care for you, but if you wanna get serious, perhaps you'd be interested in someone like this.
I think I could be a philanthropist. a kick ass philanthropist! I would have all this money, and people would love me. Then they would come to me.. and beg! And if I felt like it, I would help them out. And then they would owe me big time! (Thinking to himself) .. First thing I'm gonna need is a driver..
(Long pause) ..Felt like it. I tell you, this doll is pretty spooky. (Takes off his glasses, rubbing his eye) It's freakin' me out man. And now I got to go back out there and pick up this doormat.
(Definite) All together.
Yeah, that is odd, isn't it?
(enthusiastic) Yeah. You get a couch. I get rid of my father. It couldn't be more perfect!
Well, I think you're wrong about that. [Elaine walks past the window again, glancing in] And ah now if you'll excuse me, I'd really like to get started, please.
Yea, ya..ya know I feel terrible about Joey but it's jus..it's a great business opportunity. I-I don't even know how long I'm gonna be away for.
Yes, I heard you!
Hey, hey! We're discussing something!
Alright, alright! We'll buy her a wheelchair! Wheelchairs, engagement presents.. IT NEVER ENDS!
Alright, but no later, because my parents are coming back.
How many days was it between encounters.
Yeah, well when you don't actually do the steps, you can go through them pretty quick. You can get through six a day.
My *father* is gay...
Yes, well, I sat down with Mr. Steinbrenner. I told him you have been doing great work. I said that you deserved a raise, and if you didnt get it, that I, was leaving. (motions with both arms in a circular motion to his right)
From me.
Hey, did I tell you I called one of those girls from the personal ads in The Daily Worker?
Radiating waves of pain..
Wow. What'd you say?
All my life I've dreamed of sitting front row, behind the dugout!
Well, I'll tell you, Stacey. It's a lot of hard work. But, it comes fairly easy to me. Some people write symphonies. This is my gift. (Raises ski lift ticket while Stacey looks away)
No no. That's not what I was trying to do.
See ya.
Yeah, yeah. He went into the bedroom and started sobbing.
This must be Sheila from the photo place.
Let me just call him.
Oh, I pleaded with him.
I knew I had hit my high note so I thanked the crowd and I was gone.
Really?
I know who it was too. It was the guy who interviewed me. He was very threatened by me. Why else wouldn't he hire me? I could sell latex like that (snaps fingers).
If you're bleak, you're bleak.
(curious) Bald? Uh?
I just thought it would be nice. A little variety.
See, this should be a show. This is the show.
I just got fired.
She ate breakfast naked?
Wait, wait a second, what are you doing?
Yes, I think I would.
I mean he's a good fighter and a nice guy but I don't like him.
(Runs over to him, not wanting him to leave) What? You're going?
That's like using a wheelchair for the fun of it!
Please, doctor.
Great! (snaps fingers and grabs the extra plane ticket) Nina could go, huh? Jerry, this is great. You and Elaine. Me and Nina.
Whats the rent?
No, no. Deena, it's not what you think.
Whew! Boy, it's cold outside, huh? Oh, these New York winters, huh. Bitter cold, bitter.
I-I just don't react well to these situations. My grandmother died two months early because of the way I reacted in the hospital. She was getting' better. And then I went to pay her a visit. She saw my face. BOOM. That was the end of it.
If we decide to go at it.
Into the hole?
All names sound strange the first time you hear 'em. What, you telling me people loved the name Blanche the first time they heard it?
What is this? The marble rye?
Magellan? You like Magellan?
Ah, alright. Believe me, that kid's gonna be called Soda.
Jerry? Jerry! I'm busting! I'm busting!
(Watching the mechanic leave) I know about the vein! I cant believe this guy..
All right, I've got to go down to the unemployment office. Wanna take a walk?
Handicap? (gesturing to his cane) Oh, I'm not handicapped.
Jerry! Over here Jerry. It's me!
Okay! Alright!
(mildly embarrassed) yeah.. Thank you.
It's just that I was the one who actually paid for the big salad. She just happened to hand it to you. But it's no big deal.
They're shooting! They're shooting!
A vet?
You ditched me. That's twice. Now I demand to know what's going on!
(standing) Oh yeah, Reilly? (smugly) Well, the jerk store called. They're running outta you
"Hey listen, let me give you my card. It's got my home number on it. I want to buy the first pair when the next shipment comes in."
Pssh. Would the protg pick up stuff for the mentor?
Well,,, it's getting dark.
Yap..
I know. This was like a record. My previous record was when Joni Hirsch asked me not to tell anybody that we slept together. Kept a lid on that for about 28 seconds.
Maybe I'll buy it.
What is that? Is taht the pole?!
Yeah, okay.
So just kick her out.
Where are you meeting these women? When they get off the bus at the port authority?
It took a couple of hours of convincing. I was persistent. I was just like those guys in the movies. And it worked! She said "Yes"! I can't believe my luck that she was still available . A beautiful woman like that. You think she's good looking, right?
She confused "six" with "sex"?
Yeah, this is my first time here. (nudges Jerry again)
Do you hear yourself?
Medium turkey chili.
Can you uh, go in the bubble?
That'd be me.
Yeah, but they let me go on and on all about the Hamptons, they never said a thing! You don't let somebody lie when they know you're lying. You call them a liar!
I dont understand, you never talk to her about other women?
Me?
I really like those sons of bitches.
Every five years!
For how long?
Jerry, just remember. It's not a lie... if you believe it.
What?
All right. See you tomorrow. (George sighs, exits.)
Oh thank you.
Magic time.
(spotting possible salvation) You know what, I urge you to take it up with him. Go ahead, give him a call, he'll tell you what I'm doing here. (half to himself) Then you can tell me.
I was throwing up all night. It was like my own personal Crying Game.
Kramer, hey, hey! (Gets up out of his seat)
I really don't think we're supposed to be talkin' about this.
Yea
I gotta go.
George Costanza, assistant to the traveling secretary.
You know I still don't know how you can call lunch with me a business expense.
Thank you for leaving me alone with him!
I can't believe this is happening.
Uh, about two hundred dollars, Miss DeMooney.
Well who schedules his wedding on Super Bowl Sunday?
I feel like a huge weights been lifted off my shoulders. I... I... I feel happy! Kramer, I dont know how to thank you!
(Even more nervous than before) Oh, the, uh, the cabin.. well, (Clears throat)
Sometimes at restaurants she talks to her food 'Ooh, Mr. Mashed Potatoes, you are sooo goood.'
You're an alcoholic! You have to apologize. Step Nine! Step Nine.
Yeah, well, he probably bought it.
You see, hu, ho ho.
But I had no... I didn't realize.
Listen uh, David, I, I, I want to apologize about that comment
They always make me take stock of my life. And how Ive pretty much wasted all of it, and how I plan to continue wasting it.
Yeah, that's right. It's working.
Well, he does.
(admitting) All right..
I don't know, she lives right around the corner. You could take it here or go to the coffee shop.
Its a Twix! Theyre all Twix! It was a setup! A setup, I tell ya! And youve robbed it! Youve all screwed me again! Now, gimme one! Gimme a Twix!
... She's got it stashed away in there somewhere.
(to himself) Yeah, you said it. (to Wilhelm) Uh, excuse me, Mr Wilhelm. Uh, do you really think... Well, is this downtown trip really necessary, you know, for the project?
Yeah, I slept at my parents' house.
Yeah, the super glossy. The best they had.
All right, let's--let's focus. Can we get back to the plan?
I asked if I could borrow a sweater.
You are?
Look at that guy. Right there. Isn't that the guy from the show? He's..he's wearing the jacket.
Were up to two dollars here.
What was the tallest woman you ever slept with?
Thanks.
Yeah, the oceans really are getting very sudsy.
Pouty? I like that.
But your life is Peterman's. Now the bus tour, which is real, takes to places that, while they are real, they are not real in sense that they did not *really* happen to the *real* Peterman which is you.
Oh, this is good. This Kruger guy is clueless. I can't wait to work for him.
Yesterday, took the day off. (Picks up a red Power Ranger action figure from the model and pretends it's him.) Now, from the time I left the room...
What is that, immigrants come over, you show them how to act natural?
Yeah, had some coffee, yeah.
Im sorry, I dont see the big deal about being a matador. The bull charges, you move the cape, whats so hard?
You tell that son of a bitch no Yankee is ever comin' to Houston. Not as long as you bastards are running things.
What kind of a greeting was that?
(animated) What're you kidding me? We were all getting along so well. Where is all this coming from?
Well, I took the liberty of packing your things. (gleeful) Mom's coming to get you.
Eh eh eh, can't do it, can't do it, sorry, I got a date.
Maybe I could just use the bathroom.
Ten minutes! Here, here, (Fishes a box of Tic-Tacs out of his coat pocket and tosses them to her) Have some Tic-Tacs.
Wha? Did you use those? These are guest soaps! (he grabs the soaps and begins examining them for damage)
I've been to a few of em. If you uh start to get woozy later, which is quite common, stay close to me. I'll get you through it. (chuckles)
Jerry, Elaine, I give you.. Janet.
Hey, Ring Dings are better than anything you're gonna get at a bakery.
Yes, he's a clown!
Well, I shouldn't have to pay for it!
Good.
No.
MOOPS
It's disgusting--
Bread.
Oh no, in and out, I made sure of that. And you'll be happy to know I perused the script and it's met with my approval.
Hey!
Colin O'Brien.
My card won't work there; they're not on the Plus system.
(Showing Jerry the menu) "Chef recommends"
This townhouse?
Can't live!
One of the guys in my cell threw a piece of gum at him.
Eight o'clock.
Wow
I don't know. He said he wants to be my "key brother."
Kramer, what are you doing?
Nothing.
Would you excuse us for a minute Tim boy, we're kind of in the middle of something.
I can't believe you're hoarding sex moves. I'm out there rubbing two sticks together. You walk around with a zippo.
You know, .. blah ...
(almost gleeful) After Dinkins lost the election, he had a complete nervous breakdown. They had to lock him up.
I don't think so.
...especially a girl. Or a boy.
Really? How'd she do that?
(excited) Ho ho! (gestures and steps towards bedroom but Loretta walks the other way to the couch)
Nah. It's all right. Great! She had a good time.
No, listen; we are always sitting here, I am always helping you with your girl problems and you are helping me with my girl problems. Where do we end up?
Oh I hate to hear this. That kind of growth really irritates me.
Well you know there is an unusual number of people in this country having sex with AMPUTEES! (grabs the forum from Kramer and walks over to the clerk) . . . Penthouse forum, newspaper, gum, Clark Bar.
You're not a doctor. You shouldn't even have books like this.
(frantic) Oh, Jerry Jerry Jerry Jerry Jerry, listen, if, if you are feeling uncomfortable about this at all, at all. Do not feel like you have to take it.
Who wears a cape?
Well, why would the guy make up something like that? Of all the names he could pick, why settle on Jon Voight?
Well what do you eat?
It's impossible. I got him a wake up service.
But, uh, Raymond is a man.
what rock?
'scuse me. I uh, I was in here this morning and uh, I believe I paid you with a twenty dollar bill, (smiles) but you only gave me change for a ten.
They say this guy's the best.
She's ahem....gone
What?
Well...I'll ask Susan about it later.
No wait, you can't just leave me here! Will I see you again?
I do too. you see that's what we're about . You don't remind me of anyone and we love gum.
Ah, here it is.
Divorce is very difficult. Especially on a kid.
How would you find out something like that...wait a minute, what am I thinking? I've got the entire Yankee organization at my disposal.
What?
Okay.
Yeah, yeah, well, because of the cane. You should see the bathroom they gave me!
Alright, alright, but no funny business, same deal as last night.
I'm better than him.
Hey.
Look at this sparkle. (looks up, sees Lindsay's mother) Mrs. Enright! (runs after her) Mrs. Enright! Mrs. Enright!
And this is Kramer.
I guess I've been hanging on to them for so long cuz i couldn't accept the fact that Dad was really gone forever (hugs a piece of clothing)
That's him over there. The one that looks like a blowfish.
Conrad, is it?
yeah.. the ambulance got there very quickly
(from bathroom) VANDELAY, SAY VANDEL... (George falls) ... Vandelay Industries, ...
How could you be a doctor and not say "get outta here"? It should be part of the training at medical school "Cancer? Get outta here!" "Go home! What are you crazy? It's a little test. It's nothing. You're a real nut. You know that?" (Jerry gives him half of his sandwich to hopefully shut him up) I told you that God would never let me be successful. I never should've written that pilot. Now the show will be a big hit, we'll make millions of dollars, and I'll be dead. Dead Jerry. Because of this. (showing his lip)
Mrs. Sweedler thank you. Y-You see, this tragedy affected me in a very, very personal way.
(takes a large bite - with his mouth still full, his speech is muffled) Oh, this is fabulous.
Yeah.
It's cleavage. I couldn't look away. What am I, waiting to win an Oscar here? This is all I have in my life.
Hey, what happened with Sandy. I forgot all about it. Did you call her?
C'mon Jerry, let's go. What was that all about?
(Gets up, stopping him) Woah, woah, woah! What are you telling me for? You really had me going, there! C'mon, sit down. (They both sit back down) What do you want to do when you grow up?
(To guard) Tired?
I was curious! (imitating his moms voice)
It's "Guys And *Dolls*", not "Guys And *Guys*".
Yeah, right.
(surprise) What? I..I didn't hear about that.
It wasn't funny? What, are you kidding?
I'm not kidding, you should do it.
That's pretty pathetic.
Was she mad?
Yeah, hell be looking at us like hes backstage at a puppet show.
(yells) I didn't tattle
Just take the cap off.
When?
Coming to the airport with us?
Theyre my books.
What's going on?
My Darling Susan! My DARLING!!!
Yes it is. She just took credit for my salad. That's not right.
Hey Fred.
I always get myself in this position. Can't be on time. Gotta rush.
Come on, how hard is that? Look at all the junk that's on TV. You want an idea? Here's an idea. You coach gymnastics team in high school. And you're married. And your son's not interested in gymnastics and you're pushing him into gymnastics.
I do.
Please, it's not necessary.
It's mellifluous!
Do you wanna fight?
You know I'm enjoying it very much. I think my coworkers are really taking to me.
From the bathroom.
Holy cow!
We are going to the Knick game! Michael Jordan!
Please. Give me another chance.
Look at this. There's no spaces here. (to another car) Excuse me, are you gettin' out?
I'm gonna get some more of these kosher cocktail franks.. (leaves)
I need a break, Jerry, you know. I gotta get out of the city. I feel so cramped...
So what have you been doing with yourself?
(happily) Difficult?
I...was trying to lead the way. We needed a leader! Someone to lead the way to safety.
Psst, You're telling me.
I know what I'm doin'. In fact Mr. Wilhelm gave me one of those little stress dolls. All right. (gets up) Back to work. (acts annoyed and leaves)
(To Jerry) Hey, gimme a dollar.
Not even an apple.
(Annoyingly butting in) Kinda like Superman's fortress of solitude.
No, you wont.
Look, I gotta tell ya...I been thinkin' about it, I just don't feel right about letting you into Elaine's apartment.
Alright, c'mon, scooch over. (Tries to squeeze into the corner seat of the couch and struggles with Remy. He spills his glass of grape juice all over the couch in the process.)
Yes!
Let me tell you who did, uh, buy it...um we pitched this story to Russell Dalrymple, the president of NBC, and he ate it up with a spoon.
They're all the same. You go, you sit, you eat popcorn, you watch. I'm sick of it.
Hup, here we go. Here we go.
Yes.
Yea, she likes you.
How about the old Spider Man live action show?
Because of the day before. It's a long story.
Hey, hey, how was Florida?
Yeah haha.
Ill tell you when it happened. When that floss came flying out of my pocket.
Please. They dont do anything. Look, do I have to break up with her in person? Cant I do it over the phone? I-I have no stomach for these things.
It's all pipes! What's the difference?!
English. Does anybody speak English .Nobody speaks English.
Elaine, can I just explain something to you very privately here? Susan and I have been together many, many times now, and just between you and me, there's really no big surprises here, so...make-up sex is all that I have left.
Embezzlement.
Boy, these really do pinch the nose.
La-la-la...
Aw! Funny he's a funny guy.
No, no no it's not about postponing. I just think the first day of Spring is the perfect day to get married. You know, Spring! Rejuvenation! Rebirth! Everything is blooming all the
With Candace Bergen!
(pleading) Alright..
(to Jerry) Oh, get outta here.
(offers his) Oh, you want to taste mine.
I sold your clothes yesterday.
He got about uh, two inches from... there.
You're giving me the "it's not you, it's me" routine? I invented "it's not you, it's me". Nobody tells me it's them not me, if it's anybody it's me.
I hurt it in a hotel room. You know where they tuck the covers in real tight in those hotel rooms? I can't sleep like that so I tried to kick it out and I pulled it.
(calling after her) But..
(To Carl) Oh, by the way, order anything you want, it's all on me. Just do me a tiny favor pretend we're old friends. Oh my God! Mr. Morgan! What a coincidence, it's Mr. Morgan. Mr. Morgan, I want you to meet a dear old friend of mine, Carl.
She said that?
Oh, no no no. I pay what I say.
Jerry, I need to borrow your camera.
Hey, you grew a beard, huh?
So?
Certainly not.
You've still got pretty good coverage. Once the enemy advances beyond this perimeter - (points at Kurt's head with a pen) - then you won't be Kurt anymore.
Its an incredible deal. I dont know why you dont come with me.
They want you to do a TV show?
Oh, I was uh, I was waiting downstairs for the jackhammer, thought I'd drop by.
Well why couldn't you include me in your excuse?
Not now.
Come on. Come on. Come on. Yeah. Yeah. (grunting)
Yeah, ha ha, It's not the toilets, it's not the toilets. It's something else. Are you ready for this?
Jerry and Elaine saw you.
Ade, ahh, ahh, ah ... Im giving you a raise!
What, you mean you know about this?
...Why?
Yes! Yes. You know. She didn't know about Pasteurization. He didn't know anout Fumigation. But they made it work!
You hear the way he talks to me?
You hurt me.
(to passerby) Hey, he-hah. It's June, June.
I can't carry any changes in these pants, it falls out.
Thats exquisite. Listen, uh, if its not too much trouble, could you pass me that paper over there?
Well, you know Katy, Elaine's friend?
I gotta stay one step ahead of Neil.
(chuckles) Really? Well, we'll just see about that. Ta-ta, Tut-tle.
(surprised) Rosses.
Pssh. Yeah. Right.
Oh! my god. Oh! man...
Talk to him!
No it's not, it's the ticket-<buyers> line.
"Aahhrgh...it wouldn't take...... long pause, audience laughter) ten minutes from now, I'll be sweating all over again ,I can feel it. I'm a human heat pump!"
Hi ah, My name is George.
Yep. And it didn't take very long either.
(CONT'D) Excuse me...I really... What's happened is that my friend forgot where he parked and if you're not in a big hurry, we'd really appreciate it if...
My heart! My heart! (To Assistant) Where you going? Are you crazy?!
Alrighty, so. That's one tuck and one no-tuck. Got that?
Officer, could I just explain something to you?
No. Nothing. Fine. (he sits at the table)
Just walk.
I don't think it's gonna work out...
All right. Kramer, you block off traffic. You to go sweet-talk the pharmacist.
I am ready.
9... 1... 1. She said she'd do anything. Hello, police? Uh, yeah listen, we're in the back of a limo in Queens--
Hey Rachel!
Come here.
(dismayed) I didn't even know you wanted to get serious!
I-I'm already here. I'm here. I'm here. Uh, you know what? If you want a computer, call me. I-I gotta go.
Jerry, I felt like a straight man in some horrible sketch. He was riffing! Riffing! On my pain!
We sat there for twenty minutes, chewing, staring at each other in a defunct relationship.
I banged it on the desk in the doctor's office. An (worriedly rubbing his arm) aaaa . . .
Hey, buddies.
Hey, Cosmo what happened to your mother last night. She hung me out to dry.
Give me your key, I gotta get it.
Uh, excuse me. (stopping them from rehearsing) Excuse me. (he walks to the guy's in charge of yelling "take #!") This--This is not right. May I? (the guy looks at George with a bothered face. George then walks up to Tom and takes him away from Jerry and Michael to talk to him in private)(to Tom) You see, you're going "They fooled *me* Jerry!" (George shakes his head with disapproval) You wanna hit 'fooled' more "They *fooled* me Jerry!". You see the difference?
It's like you're livin' in the Playboy Mansion! Did she, uh, did she frolic?
Oh, yeah.
(Gloating) Hey, you got any extra furniture down there? I need some more stuff to fill that extra bedroom with the walk-in closet. (Smiles)
Maybe I need someone who doesn't speak English.
I guess there are no small diseases, only small actors.
Little Rock, Arkensas.
Well, I think we need more special days at the stadium, you know? Like, uh...Joe Pepitone Day. Or, uh...Jon Voight Day.
All right. Okay, tell me what you think about this idea Extend the doors on the toilet stalls at Yankee Stadium all the way to the floor.
I bawled uncontrollably. I just poured my guts out. And I'll tell you, Jerry, it was incredible. I never realized how powerful these tears are. I could have postponed it another five years if I wanted to.
Whoa, whoa, you're not getting in my car with gummy shoes.
What was that all about?
(looks back to the group) I can read lips. You said let's sleep together.
(improvising) My uh uncle is having an operation. I just wanted to see how he was.
Yeah!
(incredulous) You can't ground me, I'm a grown man.
Why didn't you just wear a heavier coat?
But it--eh.. It was here, I'm tellin' you, an' w--w--it was really here! The, there was, a, bar, and a, an' a dance floor..
You should have lied.
It strikes me a lot of guys are doing that kind of humor now.
Of course I'm back. Why wouldn't I be back? My mother's in the hospital, I'm going to pay her a visit.
Were dying here!
Why not. I would be.
Super Savers? Are they refundable!?
Never expected this did you?
I found it morose. Why dwell on these negative themes?
What?
L-Look at this?
It's baffling, isn't it?
Excuse me. Can I talk to you for a second there, Watkins?
and SUSAN (nod)
Boy, she is nice. I like her, I like her Jerry. She's got substance. She oozes substance.
He didn't get better, did he?
We get to go to the opera together!
uh oh..
Well, it's not that. I just, you know, I thought that we were both uh...
Because, you're not a dermatologist.
Oh, Hey, hey, hey! That's great! That's very nice. You know we've been waiting twenty minutes for you people?! What do you think, you're Mussolini?!
It's very complicated.
Yeah, follow-up question, that'll work.
I said preferably cashmere, for warmth. So in front of the whole party, he says, 'No. I don't want you stretching out the neck hole.'
(Sarcastically) What's the competition, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang?
Well take a look. It might not even belong to her.
So what? What am I supposed to do?
You don't know?
What's up?
well I don't know if there's gonna be any place to eat up there
Lesbian wedding. How do they work bride and groom out, what do they flip a coin?
All right. So, what theatre you wanna go to tonight? We got 61st and 3rd or 84th and Broadway.
Hey, where's you AIDS ribbon?
All right, listen, I'll see you guys later.
Well, you're not gonna believe what happened.
Did you ever solve the riddle of the pie?
Hnn! Let me see that.
What?
All right, look. I'm getting the Chow Fung. You don't have to have any.
What do you mean, like him?
Uuh, sleepy.
For you.
(Munching on a hamburger) This Arbys is good.
My father wears his sneakers in the pool! Sneakers!
Ta _ mal _ e!
No, I would have picked up on it. I can always tell when a woman likes me, they always somehow let you know. With me, they could torture me, I wouldn't tell them. If anything I'd try to make them think I don't like them, then they think, "Oh, look at this guy, he's not even looking at me, he must have something going for him."
Well, you see, what happened was...the doctor - the very same doctor that was attending to my late aunt - suffered an untimely stroke, and lost the use of his right hand, so...obviously I was unable to get the death certificate. However, I do have this. (Reaches inside his coat and takes out a Polaroid photo.)
What is with this family?
Wohoo, check it out.
Don't go shouting we got a hundred dollar bill. People will be jumping out of windows on top of us.
I believe strongly in that as you know.
$2? But everyone in front of me got free bread.
Ah, come on!
Are you kidding me? [Elaine walks past the window glancing in] This is the best tool we have today of measuring a persons' intelligence.
It is too!
(Modestly) Forget it.
She hasnt eaten in two days.
Gee, Kramer, I uh...I don't know what to say.
Susan, Susan would you wai,....
I wanna bite into a big hunk of cheese, just bite into it like it's an apple.
(to himself) You can't tell much from those pictures.
They are made from lycra-spandex.
Kramer, I can't help you. You're gonna have to get them some place else.
Yeah, as a matter of fact, I did.
Wow! The weekend.
(not expecting the statue to be thrown) Dit.
Right, your friend Roy.
Alrighty. Ah ... my last job was in publishing ... I uh got fired for having sex in my office with the cleaning woman.
I can't be blind, Jerry The blind are courageous.
Y'know if the guy dies, the art could really be worth something...
I, I dont know.
All right Mrs. S. I and my good pal Keith Hernandez will be right back.
Mulva! (again pointing finger at Jerry -- Kramer watches the exchange back and forth)
Hey, Van B. Boys.
I tell you everything, right?
You're gonna tell me...or not.
Ah! There's mom, there's mom.
What about them?
I might.
...I broke up with her.
That's why they gave you the apartment?
Nice.
Hey-- (spots Donna)
No. No T-bone.
What are you, Crazy? I can't ask the guy for more cigars after you burned down his cabin!
Oh, god. Look who's here.
OK, ah.. (George throws his keys on the table) see ya!
Nah, nah, it's uh, it's a long story. Just uh, try to get it up.
I know, I hate it too. I feel like an out of work porn star.
Because he's afraid she's gonna get hurt.
Well I like Dylan.
(thoughtful) I have no idea.
Wait a minute let me call Susan.
Celia's up for parole.
I find the soothing pastorial images very conduc-
Let's see, How I'm very good at going in reverse in my car, why isn't Postum a more popular drink,
We're out of Bosco!
Hi.
How's it going?
I looked up. I couldn't believe it.
Well, I can see that. What do you have to do that for? Who cares about your pants size?
What kind of hair?
Oh, well, don't worry about it -- he's got plenty of money. (spins his chair away from her)
I was telling you about Noel.
Is that Elaine?
No. I wouldnt even have to tell her. I could surprise her.
Ahh, Excuse me, how much is this?
Say it's Saturday night in Spain. They go out dancing. You think they do the flamenco?
(shouts) You be nice!
Was there any nostril penetration?
(animated) Are you insane? Jerk store, woulda smoked that guy! Smoked him, I say.
hey nice move today
Like what?
(Inquiring about the chalk board) What is this?
And people come in the store and you get involved in their lives.
Beautiful!
(Nodding, writing) "How's it going?"
Between the car getting totalled, the towing charge and the fine, there's no way I can ever pay him back...
I got the job?
I dont think theres ever been an appointment in my life where I wanted the other guy to show up. (George notices an elderly man in a leather chair.) Wait a second, is that him?
I'm telling you, skip the Drake's wedding, go to the game.
Oh, no no no -- We bought the wine here before, but now, you know we're bl-blocked in by some car double parked and we're just waiting for the guy to pull out.
I'm interviewing all these annoying little overachievers.. finally, this kid walks in - Steven Koren - a regular guy.. likes sports.. watches T.V..
Yes, because the water was cold... and the chewing warms me up.
Yeah. Cotton breathes, you see, it's much softer. Imagine playing games and your team is five degrees cooler than the other team. Don't you think that would be an advantage? They're cooler, they're more comfortable...they're happier - they're gonna play better.
No, I can't. She knows I go there. It's not secure. (the call waiting beeps) Hey, I got another call comin' in. I gotta let the machine get it. Bye. (hangs up)
Excuse me sir. Would you mind watching my bag for a minute?
Would you buy my Cayman Island ticket?
Oh, come on! Be sensible.
. . . WELL IT WAS A BIG SALAD. AND WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IS, HOW DOES A PERSON WHO HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE BIG SALAD CLAIM RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT SALAD AND ACCEPT THE THANK YOU UNDER FALSE PRETENSES - AH - AH?
She told this couple she had an affair with a matador.
No-no Jerry. I wouldn't do that.
Hey uh, isn't Elaine supposed to meet us?
Yeah.
All I know is I've been going to doctors all my life. What has it gotten me? I'm thirty-three years old. I haven't outgrown the problems of puberty, I'm already facing the problems of old age. I completely skipped healthy adulthood. I went from having orgasms immediately to taking forever. You could do your taxes in the time it takes me to have an orgasm. I've never had a normal, medium orgasm.
Hey, you know, there's this secretary at work that always had a crush on me.
(Drawing attention back to him) Excuse me!
But I asked you before if you had a ticket, and you said no!
He said he didn't know what it was.
I'm going to a poetry reading with PATRICE First time poets, in a burnt out building, down by the docks, Supposed to be good.
Look, you don't understand. There was shrinkage.
I don't know how a fish could eat laughs.
Hey, hey! Yankee game! (Changes the channel.)
Really?
These are not "scraps." These are historic remains of a once Great Society of Hair.
It's probably chocolate.
What about her place?
Oh, that's funny
What? Why?
Hey, I am not here for rage. I'm here for revenge.
Yeah, yeah. Just delivering some presents to my folks.
Oh, yeah, me too, me too. Boy oh boy oh boy...! You know, in fact, I've been thinking about it, and I feel like I'm stealing from you! Five-hundred dollars! It's gonna be worth thousands soon! You know what? On second thought, I can't even accept it.
She um, she wants to see The Muted Heart.
And then I hear this rabbi on television, I mean imagine.
Packyderm?
Who do you like?
ah.
Dad, it's me. Hey, listen, I was at Fortunoff's the other day, and, you know what, you were right.
Muy sumpatico. Muy muy muy.
This is totally different! That was my secret, this is Jerry's secret! There's...there's attorney-client priveleges here! If I play it by your rule, no one'll ever confide in me again, I'll be cut out of the loop!
Jerry took the couch back.
Can you believe it? It's happening! It's finally happening! I'm free!!
There, there I'm fine.
Excuse me, are you gonna be very long?
Kramer. Guess what.
You know, it's a miracle you're not married. (beat) Hey, I'm not obligated to buy anything, am I?
Do you think it would be better if I did?
Hey, I've done that today.
Who's that?
"Arrrrrrgh!! .. It's George.. Oh! Sports wholesaler. yeah. yeah. .. thanks for calling back. No , no , no still got the shoes, still got the shoes. Lots of them. This is.. beautiful athletic gear."
Okay.
I was in there for two minutes. He didnt do anything. Touch this, feel that  seventy-five bucks!
The show! Forget about the show! We should take the idea to a different network
You got odds.
Yeah, that's what I want-- triangles. Alright, I'm outta here. Have fun with what's-her-name.
(to the woman) Boy, I have to get to a bathroom.
But it's not a photograph, I need a photograph!
Hi. Look at how obtrusive this is.
uh Tony? there's not gonna be too many sandwiches
You just said you weren't tucking.
So... Can I have it?
Yeah, hold on. I'm, uh, I'm just trying to get a reading on my dashboard compass. Where are my parents?
Toasting makes me uncomfortable. But toast, I love. Never start the day without a good piece of toast. In fact, let's toast to toast.
Actually I think I'm gonna take a few days off (starts to leave)
Really?
(sitting) Newww tuxedo. For the Pinstripe Ball. Steinbrenner is throwing a huge party at Tavern on the Green, heh!
Yes, but I still don't feel right about letting you into Kramer's apartment without his permission.
(hitting Cynthia playfully with a napkin) Stop it, stop it.
Hey. Where is everyone?
WAIT ,WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!!!!.... Where was the tape recorder?
So?
Because of society, right?
Very good.
Yeah, the tenant association has decided to hear my side of the story. So, uh, I gotta kinda get ready. I'll see ya.
Why not?
Hi, I was just uh... I just had one little question about uh, my assignment.
Ripe. Boy, this Joe's got some terrific fruit.
I see, well, thats open to interpretation. Because so much depends on the layering and the quality of the wetness in the eyes.
I love you, Jerry.
Well, I didn't want to break our date.
Really? My father has a ton of old clothes just sitting up in the attic, y-you think they're worth something?
Eighteen dollars.
Well, I'm gonna go back there later and return it when there's different people working.. You want to catch a movie?
Oh, wait, isn't scalping illegal?
I'm sure he'll be back in a second.
Uh...no.
Elaine
Come on!
Better than before?
(negative) Hu-ho, boy.
Hello, Ken. It's George Costanza. I think we need to talk.
My mother loves Hampton tomatoes. She's nuts for Hampton tomatoes.
I think we have.
You know, my arm feels a lot better. That Wendy really knows her stuff. (he writes out a cheque)
Yes. A male roommate.
You see? We were made for each other. (Thinking to himself) It's amazing. If I reach out and touch her breast right not, she'd scream and throw me out of the car. But at this time tomorrow, I could touch it all I want.
Your hair?
Yeah. What are you doing with the Daily Worker?
Hey.
"throws your hips off kilter" So where's your money? (pulls out his wallet)
He didn't say he can't.
Ow!
And the amazing thing is she eats like there's no tomorra'. I mean I've never seen an appetite like this. Desserts. Everything. I don't know how she does it.
Another job?
Well what if I told you I'm thinking of moving here?
Uh, no, I'm not.
85, Jerry! 85 IQ !
Tell me your impressions, I would love to hear what a young woman thinks of "The Big Game".
Kramer, Kramer's not here...I knew it. I knew it! I knew this would happen. (SCREAMING) Kramer! Kramer!
You don't know where we parked?
(Getting frustrated) I know.
Hey.
Still getting nothing!
They'll make you a Big Salad. What do you think, they're the only one's that make a Big Salad?
It just does.
All right?
(panicky) What are you gonna do? Are you gonna call the police?
Well, anyway, the book club meets tomorrow, Mr. Temple.
Your parents are going to Paris right?
Oh. Ha. They are my keys, how weird. (laughs)
That's not Irish.
Well, I wouldn't want you to do that. You know there's a lot of losers out there.
Yeah so??
You heard him.
Feel? What's that?
(he drops a paper airplane he was holding) Mr. Wilhelm!
I didn't say I was Ted Danson.
I'm trying to get out of this Big Brother program. So when you get to Paris (handing Morty the postcards) all you have to do is drop 'em in any mailbox.
There must be some way to find out.
Give me two bucks. Ill do it for two bucks.
Oh, please, somebody, stop this!
Yes! Yes! Everybody has to like me. I must be liked!
No, she left. Listen, you can't mention any of this to Elaine. Cynthia will kill me, we made a deal.
Ask' em Are there any side effects?
Yeah, him.
Elaine, this pilot...it doesn't matter to me, it's not me I'm concerned about...it's my mother. I've been over to the hospital to see her...
I like (imitates Kramer) "cookies."
You think so?
I am?
(excited, pushing Jerry forward) All right, let's go, let's go, let's go, come on.
You mean, like, a former member?
But Mr. Steinbrenner, how can I be expected to perform my job properly, knowing that my uh, subordinate is making more money than I am? With all due respect sir, it's outta whack.
What are they doin' lettin' you bastards on an airplane? Don't they know that's against FAA regulation?
Right, I got news. You ready? (deep breath) Gary Fogel had cancer.
You want your blankets tucked in?
Oh, no, no. Twix is the only candy with the cookie crunch.
Cut it.
I've had bedroom naked, I've had walk-to-the-bathroom naked... I have never had living-room naked.
He's giving you furniture? Who is this guy?
I have to talk to Elaine. This cleaing lady is turning the screws on me. She's pushing for this whole relationship thing. She keeps calling me, threatening to go to the boss with this thing, I could lose my job, I gotta do something to keep her quiet.
You want to hear more? The master bedroom opens into the solarium.
Why?
Oh my God, its exactly the same!
What were her exact--
You know, I'm down to one kiss hello. My aunt Sylvia.
Maybe it's not even stupidity. Maybe it's just a blatant disregard for basic human decency. Yeah this how dictator's start. Do you think Mussolini would circle the block six times looking for a spot?
Excuse me, the guy is wearing a jacket that my friend is...
Five-hundred dollars?! What?
Where's Elaine?
Help! Someone!
No, Can't be...For instance I remember when we first met, we had a great conversation.
George?
Your wake up guy asked you out?
Good for you (sympathetic)
Very good. Juicy.
Who?
Not.
Well, it worked when I met George Peppard last week.
(puzzled) I bought it. (enters lobby)
I'd like to say it once to someone that can actually hear it!
Yeah, good luck. Hey I'll meet you outside.
W--then I'm pretty much where I am now. At least I got to take a ride on a spaceship.
You uh owe me for the ticket.
Does the heater even work in this car?
Well, you never know. (picks up more shrimp) Let's see how many I can fit in my mouth.
Yeah, I'm a great quitter. It's one of the few things I do well. I come form a long line of quitters. My father was a quitter, my grandfather was a quitter... I was raised to give up.
You're in latex
(examining reflection) I really think this looks pretty good.
Let's see if it's Hayman?
(on the answering machine) Jerry, it's George. Hey, hey are you all set for the weekend. This is going to be great. You're going to have a great time with Naomi.
I forgot to ask you; how did the revenge date go?
...and then when I saw the photo I remembered where I'd seen him; the boom box incident.
Would you like a Pepto-Bismol? I keep them in my wallet...! (Russell goes into the bathroom and shuts the door.) (To Jerry) Do you think he liked it? (From the bathroom, we hear Russell violently heaving his guts.)
What? I'm not eating bread now. I'm off bread.
Grass
Nothing. Uh, I don't know. I gotta go.
How hard could it be? You make a little contribution, you have a ceremony. I am going to think about this. I am really going to think about this.
What kind of a therapist are you? I'm telling I'm scared that something terrible is gonna happen to me, right away you start looking for tumors?
...Who's not doing this for the money.
There you go.
So you're talking...
Yeah. Once belonged to Jon Voight.
I thought it was a date.
(quietly) Ya.
It's George
Do you hold the neck together with one hand, or are you just letting it flap in the breeze?
Jerry! Oh, my God! What are you doing!?!
I don't know, I didn't ask.
I mean, big would even be ok, a little beyond big.
(pause) What do you think, Jerry.
If my parents had a mantel, I might be a completely different person.
(Looks fed up with his parents) Oh my God..
There she is. (waiving his arms quickly above the table - to nix the conversation) No no no no no no.
It it's huge. It's probably like North Dakota.
Fish. What do they do?
(Holding out his arms - giving praise) It's beautiful. Now, what do I say?
(shouting) What happened to Soda?! I thought we all agreed on Soda.
Why did the policeman have to yell at me like that? (Elaine enters)
So, you want to come down to Mario's Pizza with me and help me pick up the Frogger?
That doesn't explain the lipstick on the dashboard?
Oh, that's bad. That's bad.
No, the Portuguese waitress.
Where?
No.
(To Elaine) Hey, what happened?
You already told me everything.
No one hails a cab like me. My hailing technique is unmatched. I get the wrist going from side to side and boom! Cabs are crashing into themselves to just pick me up. (a cab stops) All right, here we go. Let me get door. Feminists aside, I know women like the door holding. Here we are all righty. O.K. Jodi let's get together again real soon and say hello to your sister for me.
Have you seen the new addition to the Guggenheim?
Wait a second. (smells it). all right.
A-and don't settle for 145, you can do better, you're a genius. Heheheh (laughs)
Oh oh oh, all right, fine, Jerry, you win. Take it, just take it!
So she starts vaccuming, back and forth, back and forth, her hips swivelling, her breasts, uh... (trying to think of a word)
Well, I'm not buying it. No way. Forget it. No way I'm buying this! (beat) I mean, look at it! What is it? It's a bunch of squiggly lines! (beat) Are you telling me you couldn't paint this?
The guy that stole my glasses. This time I got 'em! (George follows the man onto the street, dragging the blind man with him) Would you pick it up a little?
Why is that?
Oh, that's wonderful.
Well, sir, I - I gave out the fake card, because, um, I don't really celebrate Christmas. I, um, I celebrate Festivus.
How do you know?
I told you to stop with the hopping.
Ah, and I got a date with the sales woman. She's got a little Marisa Tomei thing going on.
??? sir.
It's Mickey Mantle, Jerry. My idol.
I bent over backwards for that woman! Is it that thing I said about her sister?
like that (looking at Jerry)
(Identifying what Jerry said) Clint Eastwood!
Gennice palying today?
No, you can have it.
Well bear in mind that I am in the smaller office.
Ya. That's what she told me.
You know what? I can't do this. I can't read books anymore; books on tape have ruined me, Jerry. I need that nice voice. This book has *my* voice. I hate my voice.
I can't hear you.
So... uh you feel okay about that whole thing... what we do in there... you're generally okay with everything in there?
Is this the ticket holders line, or the buyers?
All right, all right, I didnt want to tell you this. You wanna know why she called you?
I lost them. I can usually come up with one good comment during a meeting but by the end it's buried under a pile of gaffs and bad puns.
It's nothing.
Bear with you! This is a parking lot PEOPLE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO GET
I solve problems. That's just what I do.
That's dynamite. Yeah, I'll look for the Chinese food leftovers.
(on the speaker) Ya
Yeah. I can't get over it.
Chamberlind, you could hold his head in nthe toilet, he'd still give you half of Europe.
You're not goin to do it? What do you mean, You're not goin to do it?
Is-is that what I said 'no story'? Because Jerry had to tell me later.
I had a job interview.
You wanna sell computers? I will show *you* how to sell computers! Hello, Mr. Farneman. You wanna buy a computer? No? Why not? All right, I see! Good answer! Thank you! (Lloyd rings his sale bell) Serenity now!
All right, I'll tell you what... why don't you go into the store and I'll wait in the car?
What is a barometer exactly?
No, he doesn't know O'Brien, if he knew O'Brien he wouldn't have a sign. Let's just do it.
Sid, it's completely his fault.
I'm just asking, all they have to do is say no.
Yeah. Hey! Hey!
What, are you, nuts? You're gonna spend more on the ticket than you're gonna get back from Grossbard.
Jerry, you came for the big moment.
So where are you staying?
He wants to meet you? I'll tell you what. I'll show up. He doesn't know we're friends. I'll pretend I haven't seen you since High School. I'll back up the story.
She said first row! Right behind the dugout!
There are some people in this room who would have been very happy to never see this briefcase again. There are people in this room who think they can destroy other people's property and get away with it. Well, let me tell you something about those people. They weren't counting on this brain! And this tape recorder.
So what do you care what she thinks.
Why? That's a *legitimate* sociological question.
No. So, tonight she's got tickets for that show she's been working on. The Flying Sandos Brother.
That should be 14, let me just...(corrects it with a pen.)
Well that makes sense.
All right. All right. Let's not get into panic mode! Let's not make a big deal outta this thing or we're never gonna get through this night.
Amazing. I drive them to lesbianism, he brings 'em back.
And your wine.
You can't, it's a textbook.
So, attractive one day - not attractive the next?
Olive?
So what could I do? I couldn't go through with it. She threatened to kill herself.
We have to discuss my alibi.
You think I should come clean? What d'you think, you think I Should confess?
George
Dwayne, my friend and I would like to exchange frames. Could you put his lenses in my frames and mine in his?
I know. Completely bonkers!
hu, Coffee. Too much coffee (nervous laughter).
I heard your whole conversation.
Alright, now the play is tomorrow night. So do you want to have dinner first, or do you just want to meet at the theatre?
I can't do these puzzles.
Yeah, so what?
Oh they'll get out of the way. You really smell banana?
Jerry, its not my fault.
(incredulous) What?
(grabbing the sweater back) Well it's not really damaged. 85 dollars huh?
Alright, how's this? We wait till we get to your street corner, we see Elaine and Kramer then we get out. They can't shoot us in the city.
No, no. No, no, no. It was not trash!
Huh? You know? Spring. Rejuvenation. Rebirth. Everything's blooming. All that crap.
Well, Steven, I, uh.. (All the sudden, a small gang steps out of nowhere, surrounding George)
My bag?
Yes, sir, that was a good sandwich, sir.
Should I take some?
He's an importer-exporter.
This'll only take a second.
(sings) Co-stan-za. (like "By Mennen")
Wha, that's a Kinney lot?
How could they not notice it?!?
No. Just imagine her reaction.
I'm bad. I'm *bad*!
Id love to go. Make an appointment.
How come uh, no chair?
I did it! It's all done!
Well, well, I had a dream, Jerry.
We cant just let him get away with this.
What mail?
(In a state of hysteria) I'm an eggplant! I'm an eggplant! I'm a minstrel man!
(singing as he exits florist with bouquet and a cup of coffee) "...tootsie, good-bye. Too-too, tootsie..." (takes a drink, makes a face, shouts back at shop) You call this coffee? (dumps out coffee behind him, accidentally hitting a parked car's windshield)
Im keeping it. Im going down with the ship.
Now if I wanna see anything I gotta wear these.
Is he dead?
Oh, you're fine... you're fine. (looking at Tom in the back and then quieter to Jerry) So you think this guy playing Kramer took the raisins?
I'm sure I have a low IQ. I've been lying about my SAT scores for 15 years.
I don't know.
We, uh, we go on foot from here.
Oh, hello, it's you! (angry) Listen lady, I got six minutes left on that meter, and I'm not budging til you admit you stole my twenty dollars. (smug) Huh-hu-hur, you're not so tough when you're not on your horse, are you Ruthie?
How much do you tip a chamber maid?
(To the man behind him in line) Yeah, right Im gonna get my car repaired at a dealership. Huh! Why dont I just flush my money down the toilet?
What?
You could do worse!
Allllll right!
Well, if she keeps horsing around with that tractor--
Oh yeah, when are you gonna execute that plan?
Elaine...let me just explain something to you. See, this is not just a weekend routine...I'm on the verge of make-up sex here. You know about make-up sex?
He's beboppin' and scattin', and I'm losin' it!
The government is very touchy about us being in the air. Let us run around on the ground as much as we want. Anything in the air is a big production.
I think that's a good sign.
Because, if you ever see her and it comes up, we have to be in sync. Hmm?
Hey!
This thing can't hurt me, can it? I mean, it is a laser. What if it hits my eye?
Yeah.
Aah! Fire!
You wanna see?! (pulling off the hat to reveal the bald pate) There! There it is! (turning to Newman) Alright, here! You wanna try on the hat?! Here! Try on the hat!
Right.
What happened? Did he bring it up?
That woman was unequivocally the worst date of my life.
(from the intercom) Yeah, its George.
Well, me neither.
(dismissive) It's no good.
(As he leaves) One would hope.
Ahh, Steinbrenner gave 'em to us, in honour of Phil Rizzuto being inducted into the Hall of Fame.
I don't even know what they think. That's why I'm in therapy.
I could..
You're incredible.
Allright, very good I'd like my car and my deposit back please
Well, then, I am gonna have to ask you to turn your key.
Uh-Huh (gulp) Why didn't she like me?
Demi (the "i" sounds like an "e")? I thought it was Demi?
Okay, so you remember I made the initial call Sunday, she doesnt call back. I call again Monday, I leave another message. I call Tuesday, I get the machine again, I know youre there, I dont know what your story is. Yesterday, Im a volcano  I try one more call, the machine comes on, and I let fly like Mussolini from the balcony, Where the hell do you get the nerve? You invite me up for coffee and then you dont call me back for four days? I dont like coffee, I dont have to come up. Id like to get one more shot at the coffee just so I could spit it in your face.
Mint?
He's older, completely covered in filth, no whistle, but I think it's him.
Yeah.
Yeah, I know what happened.
Aha. Aha. Could it be because you don't want him to know that you have a friend who pees in the shower, is that it?!
Thirteen thousand?
(interrupts her) You know what. I don't think I'm going to be able to stay over tonight.
No no no, no mistake, no mistake. No, no , listen, we're going to get married over Christmas, I It doesn't make any difference to me. It's fine. Really.
This is Morning Mist.
No, he said there was nothing he could do, and next time I should probably break the Prozacs in half.
(Gets up to leave) Well, scintillating as always.
You've never heard of Bozo the Clown?
Hey, Lainey, wanna see the horsey?
What?
All right, I'm gonna find a guy with a truck. GLC must live on!
(Still holding the note) I think I'm having a heart attack.
(Quickly making it up) Well, possibly. I wrote an off-Broadway show, "La Cocina." ..Actually, it was off-off-Broadway. It was a comedy about a Mexican chef.
Yeah, but get this, the message said 'call me if you have the time'. Heh heh if I have the time, you get it?
Hey, wanna get some lunch?
How're the folks?
It means a non-Jewish woman.
She must have seen me eating it on TV.
Now my parents are gonna know I had people over.
That is what I want.
(rising to his feet) Hey! Hey, you! (setting off after her) Come back here!! Don't gallop away!!
Yeah, Susan tell him.
(identifying it) Wrath of Khan!
I'm the opposite of every guy you've ever met.
I dont like to discuss figures.
Who am I going to meet who is better than her? No one, Jerry. No one's better than her.
Hi.
Movies. I like to watch movies.
I'm bored. She's boring, I'm boring, we're both boring. We got out to eat, we both read newspapers.
Yeah, I feel like I've grown.
Shes a pig. The woman's a pig, what wrong with her--
All right! All right. I'll tell you what. How about this? Got the date; March 21st, the first day of spring.
Well, giddy-up!
(Unconvincingly coy) About what?
Nothing, I... said it was a little problem.
Who are they?
Doesn't she have collision?
(clears throat) Maura, I, uh- I want you to know... I-I've given this a lot of thought. I'm sorry, but... we, uh, we have to break up.
if you hadn't come, this whole thing wouldn't have happen (back on Jerry and Elaine's side, we can hear George saying "I was the one who was invited", Jerry opens the door)
What if she becomes Miss America? You could be dating Miss America, Jerry!
Poor kid.
Anything, everything, something, nothing - Who the hell cares? Put me down. I'm down!
(wondering where this is leading) No sir.
They're not here! You cost me fifty bucks!
Oh boy.
Fabulous, I'll think about that George, thank you!
(Snapping) Is that important, really? What is this, a police investigation? The woman's been through enough. She has to relive the experience now?!
Coco?
Well what about all the Lloyd Braun sales?
Why didn't you say something then?
Yes he is. Let me ask you something. When you come out of the shower and you put your robe on, do you cinch it real tight, are you concerned about that?
Uh, Carol, can I talk to you for a second? Right now?
I'll tell you what, if pig-man shows up, we'll squeeze him in. I'll see you later.
Jerry? Jerry can you hear me?
How you gonna catch him? He's probably boarded the plane already.
I've always liked her. Remember her in 'Carnal Knowledge'?
(checking his watch) Hey, let's get the check, she's taking the bandages off at four o'clock.
. All right , just give me my car and let me get the hell out of here.
Shortness of breath..
Why not?
[to himself] Hey, whatd'ya know? Look at that! A *lesbian* sighting. Oh-ho! My lucky day. They're *so* fascinating. Why is that? Because they don't want us. You gotta respect that...
Oh, this is great.
It's a huge problem, Jerry. The hardest part about having sex with a woman is getting her to come back to your place! He's already got that.
(Takes a sip) Hey, it's not too bad..
He's an importer.
Can she talk?
yeah, time is what he's indicating there..
(agitated) Alright, I gotta try and talk my mother into taking him off my hands.
Hey, hey, hey!
No I didn't!
You're cuttin' me loose?
Why?
(thinks for a second) I got used to it.
Sure, dudes in this town are dime a dozen.
Let's do it.
Yeah! She made me promise not to tell you .It's supposed to be a joke.
Really? Because people do meet in places besides a bar, huh?
What?
Yes! Because it is the mature, adult thing to do.
I'm the assistant to the travelling secretary. I'm going on the road trips with 'em! I'll be on the plane... I'm working in Yankee Stadium! This is a dream, I'm busting, Jerry, I'm busting!
(sad) Yeah! Yeah. Hey--hey you, you know.. Maybe I'll call you sometime.
I confused it with another awning.
It was very traumatic. The last thing I remember is you flinching. Then, everything went black.
What?
Wait till you hear this! (George sees Donna and no Jerry.) Whoa, ah, Im sorry, I didnt, I had no idea.
I dont know. But I dont. Im actually almost happy to hear it.
Ah, ...A beautiful successful intelligent woman's in love with me and I throw it all away. uh oh boy. Now I'll spend the rest of my life living alone. I'll sit in my disgusting little apartment watching basketball games, eating Chinese take out. Walking around with no underwear. Because I'm too lazy to do a laundry.
Well, sure Joey, sure, I would be thrilled.
(agitated) Well, I, I couldn't come. I, I had to drive my mother to, to the chiropodist.
What is with this dog, I thought we were taking it to the pound.
hey
How many tickets are you paying today?
Oh, it's beautiful. It's in sports.
Yeah. So, how's Cindy the maid?
Great! Great! I actually just had two meaningful intelligent conversations with Corbin Bernsen and George Wendt.
Thank you.
I have a ten.
Wait a minute, call the car phone, see what happens.
Yes, oh yes very much.
(excited) You're saying I stand to inherit three hundred thousand dollars, is that what you're saying?!
Yeaah, beautiful... (They try to hit a high five, but George hits Elaine in the forehead.) Sorry...
Where you going?
It's too late.
Excuse me, are you going to be much longer? I have to make a very important call.
Hey I get a free trip to Paris, I go in the Big Brother's Hall-of-Fame, I mail my own postcards.
Seemingly. Seemingly. But within that basic framework there are many subtle variations, only discernable to an acute observer, that reflect the many moods, the many shades, the many sides of George Costanza.
That wasn't a laser pen.
Maybe I'll get her some jewelry.
So Dad,--
At the funeral, give or take. You know, deep down, I always kinda felt that they blamed me for Susan's death.
Yes, but I am not taking it.
I think Im getting tired of it. I mean is that all it does? Hello? La-la-la?
hitting phone
Oh yeah yeah, don't you know they used pastrami in that movie 9? weeks? Remember the pastrami scene?
What, you think I eat all my meals with you? (To waitress) Excuse me, sweetheart? I think you may have overcharged us. What is this?
( mouth full) Hi, this is fantastic ( puts the pit in the a plate)D'you ever had a Macanaw peach?
And now?
Aw, Mr. Kruger, Sir. Merry Christmas! (Hands him a card)
Oh, don't look. T-This is the part where they change me.
Yeah! Boy, she is something, isn't she?
Got it.
(from the intercom) Yeah.
Hey, thanks. I owe you a big one.
Yes we will.
Then of course with evolution, the octopus lost the nostrils and took on the more familiar look that we know today.
[quietly] C'mon, go along...
Oh, my God! My *MOTHER*!!!
How old's the son?
Well, I'm sorry!
What's the matter with your leg?
Id like to help, but my neck..
Oh leave Jack alone. Jack's got enough problems. I'll just take the small office.
What did Jodi say?
Wait a minute, she did a skin cancer screening at Peterman?
(let down) So, that's it?
I thought I saw him look in the mirror suspiciously.
I was doing standup comedy in Kennebunkport Maine. ??? night club. The stage was on a cliff and the audience was throwing all the comics off.
This is *unbelievable* B.O.
Really.
You don't listen when people talk to you anymore!
Jose Jimenez, ... verrry funny. ..very funny.
All I know about is sports. That's it. No matter how depressed I get, I could always read the sports section.
Uhm...Id like to ask you...ask you to analyze a hypothetical phone call, you know, from a female point of view.
Since when is Elaine's boyfriend selling cars? I thought he was a mechanic.
(smiling) I'm on a winning ball club, Jerry. They probably wanna pick my brains.
Oh I don't know. Check this out.
Oh, hi...
Waffle maker.
Yeah, tell im. But quickly, Im double parked here.
Excuse me just for a second. ( fixes his hair looking at his reflection in a coffee pot.)
You disappoint me, my friend. Sandy wants nothing to do with you. She tells Laura, "If you want to waste your time with that pervert, that's your problem."
Yeah, yeah. I've heard that. Meanwhile I'm here with you in a parking garage, what am I supposed to do?
This guy's giving me the stare-ahead.
This is what they would do in the movies! It's a beautiful thing! It's like a movie! I'm gonna slip him a mickey!
Let's say it comes down to me and one other guy. He's got a nice quiet suit, and I'm whooshing all over the place! Who do you think he's gonna hire?
Theyre the ones who should be ashamed. They signed me to a one-year contract. As long as I show up for work every day, they have to pay me.
So you can't duplicate 'em.
(to Elaine) Do you want us to go with you?
Yeah.
Do you know what happens if I miss him? I don't get credit for the pickup and I lose my 50 bucks...
Well, we would like to be in business. Let's do business. We'll have some business. Let's have business.
Oh, oh, your papers
Aren't you concerned about the security guard?
Narks?
And?
Because important things go in a case. You got a skull for your brain, a plastic sleeve for your comb, and a wallet for your money.
(as Jerry and Elaine continue to whine) Give it! Give it! (he finally gets the remote away from them) Pinheads.
I've matured.
You must be very proud Mr. Visaki. (shaking his hand) And may I say sir they're lovely girls, absolutely lovely girls. It's nice to see such fine upstanding women in gainful employment, Mr. Visaki.
Hey.
Oh, no, Sir. Festivus is all too real. And.. I could prove it - if I had to.
I'm getting a makeover.
What? Did I what?
I told them to meet me in front of my building at six-fifteen.
I-I don't get these birds! They're breaking the deal. It-it's like the pigeons decided to ignore me!
We're on the Grand Central, there's no traffic.
Don't you believe me? It's their fiftieth anniversary. You know this is gonna kill him. You're aware of that. Kill him. On the biggest night of his life...
Well, he has to play! He can't just not play. We're playing! Look, I gotta see him, how do I get in touch with him?
It's a coincidence.
"HEY! JIMMY!!! ha ha ha........Great game."
You're very good. Very good with the moanings and the gyrations. Y-You really had me going there for a minute.
All right!
You want me to roll six thousand of these?! What, should I quit my job?!
I got to go after her.
Because my cousin's imbecile dog was rolling around outside and they got in his carpet.
Gimme the purse!
Why? Is there anything wrong?
Okay.
Ah, Alright, before that, I was in real estate. I quit, because the boss wouldn't let me use his private bathroom. That was it.
Hey! George and Janet.
You wanted to see me, El Presidente?
T-bone steak.
Will they give us cash?
I think you absolutely have to say something to this guy. Confront him.
I have never seen a Mohel like that.
(Muttering to himself as he walks to the bedroom) More stuff..
I had the arm! Joe...
Not that much.
No.
God.
Thats it! Thats it! I cant take it. I cant take it anymore! You stole the statue! Youre a theif! Youre a liar!
What? What are you talking about.
(grabs the phone quick) Got it, Got it,...Hello?
You should have somebody take a look at that.
Hey listen... umm, instead of the movie... uh, maybe we'll go back and uh you know...(nudges her head with his head)
Jerry...
Should we tell him we're leaving?
She doesn't deserve a baby shower. She deserves a baby monsoon. She deserves Rosemary's baby!
But if you think about it...26 teams, 162 games a season, you'd think eventually an entire team would get wiped out.
Elaine you don't understand. I had 103 temperature when I bought that sweater. I was so dizzy I was seeing red dots everywhere. I thought everything in the store had a red dot on it. I couldn't distinguish one red dot from another. I couldn't afford anything. I have nothing. I haven't worked for a really long time. (Jerry is standing right behind George. Jerry takes out a hankerchief and starts fake-crying in it.) I mean look, I have no clothes, look at what I'm wearing. It's just a little red dot.
I was naked.
Oh yeah! Middle finger, straight up, at me! At us!
Uh, uh, yeah. Actually, the, uh, I-I bumped my elbow on a desk and uh injured something an.. now it sort of moves involuntarily.
What's the difference, you're a woman. They're supposed to be touching you.
Lobster.
(wry) He knows.
What idea? I just said something. I didn't know you were going to listen to me.
Well I've never met your sister but obviously these are not hard-and-fast rules. (to the waitress) Darling, the tea is getting a little cold sweetheart.
Hey, Jerry, what was the name of the exterminator who fumigated your apartment when you had fleas?
Not with that big glass window looking out into the hall. I'd love a good nap. That's the only thing getting me out of bed in the morning. I'll see ya'.
Cops. I don't even care about cops. I wanna see more garbage men. It's much more important. All I wanna see are garbage trucks, garbage cans and garbage men. You're never gonna stop crime, we should at least be clean.
Wait a minute. This looks familiar. This reminds me of something. I can do this.
What are you doing? Where do you think you're going?
Jerry, I like being with her. Plus, I know where she is all the time. I have relatively no competition. An-and you know how you live in fear of the pop-in?
So uh... Wrath of Khan, huh?
How could you not know who Bozo the Clown is?
No, I didn't.
The outlet?
(singing) Oh hey, if you happen to see the most beautiful girl who walked out on me. Tell her I'm sorry. Tell her I need my baby ... oh won't you tell her ... I love her. Oh hey, ...
Well, that was bound to happen.
Kramer...
By the way, have you spoken to Elaine yet today?
Cross the wires? I can't even make a pot of spaghetti.
Hu-Yeah, interest. It's an amazing thing. You make money without doing anything...
(snorts) C'mon.
Well, he's merry.
No, but um I have very good report with women, very good, comfortable. And from the first time I laid eyes on a brassieres, I was enthralled.
Ahhhhh...
I had to give it to the liquor store guy.
'Why don't I rent the movie.' See, this is when I like you. Alright, now I'm relieved. (Kramer enters and comes over to the booth.)
That's got nothing to do with it.
(after Wendy and to the receptionist) Oh, you have a policy! (to the world at large) The delicate genius has a policy! George heads for the door.
Excuse me, sir, do you have the time?
"Well...there's no room for someone like that in this organization."
What is Lloyd Braun doing here?
Hu humm? i suppose we could go to Lincoln Center and I'd be wearing sneakers and jeans and that would be fine too.
I know. The only way to fix it now, is to get a whole new photo of Kruger.
Shes an... etymologist. You know, bees, flies, gnats. W-What about you?
My father opened his shirt...
I don't care. Look, Lloyd doesn't know what he's up against. This is nothing to me. (moving his arm) My whole life is a lie.
(pleased) Yeah, it is.
(to Elaine) Right, alright. (to Jerry) Oh Jerry, do you have any apples?
Well, whoever he was, he knew a lot about The A-Team!
How do you kn ow?
How do you know?
Hey, Mr Seinfeld. (shakes Morty's hand) Hey, Mrs Seinfeld. How are you?
Don't you see. Women like that are like, members of a secret tribe living in a forbidden city. People like me have not been inside in thousands of years.. But with this, it's like I've already been with one of her own! My hands been stamped! I come and go as I please!
Thanks. Gee, you know, I thought you were mad at me.
...and the Jews steal our money through their Zionist occupied government and use the black man to bring drugs into our oppressed white minority communities.
(With pride) Made it up.
How could it still smell after all that?
Where are you going?
(from bathroom) VANDELAY, SAY VANDELAY!
Yeah.
How much?
(getting up and leaving) Alright! That's it for me. Goodnight everybody.
(whistling).(laughing).AlrightOK.
I'm gonna go meet Danielle. (grabs his coat) There's a new Neil in town! (triumphant laughter) Hahaha!
(The damage has been done. He is slightly angered at Jerry) May I ask, what do you read in the bathroom?
It's something . It's hope.
Good, good day. How was your day?
Oh, I can't believe you're dropping out, too. So now Kramer and I have to pay for the entire gift?
Hey, who's talking to you?
Jerry, let's go! You ready?
(to the executives) Excuse me. Did you hire the Sunshine Carpet Cleaners?
Thank you.
Well, it's not my fault. You poked me!
I know they're in there, the three of them, laughing at me. Together, laughing and lying.
Yes, they are bold. Jerry, what do you think?
Alright! Please, please! I cannot have this constant bickering!.. Stress is very damaging to the epidermis! Now, I have an important photo session in the morning - my hands have got to be in tip-top shape, so please - keep the television down, and the conversation to a minimum.
You vomited in 1987.
Are you a religious man, sir?
Yes I do.
Who?
You know, Louise. I think you'll find this amusing. In early Euclidean geometry--
Twelve dollars? I knew we should have gone to the bakery. I guarantee you theyre not getting no twelve dollar cake.
Yeah and you get this really cool T-shirt when you sign on..
Let me see the watch.
Well what would I say in the note?
"Off the wagon"?
It.
Where are you sitting?
All right, OK, I'm goin' in.
(Reading the card from Whatley) "This holiday season a donation has been made in your name to the Children's Alliance."?
How could that piece of *crap* cost $98.00!?
Well...not "out." She's a prisoner.
She did. Today.
No I can't. I can't die with dignity. I have no dignity. I want to be the one person who doesn't die with dignity. I live my whole life in shame. Why should I die with dignity?
(animated) You're letting him have a woman over?!
Give 'im the jacket already!
(Puts nuts into his mouth, and in the process covers his mouth) We bring her to the party, and she can tell me what Gwen is saying about me.
Hey, don't embarrass me today. I got some friends in the stands. (George makes a swinging motion with an imaginary bat and pulls something in his back.)
There's no Gammy.
No! No! Turn it off! No feats of strength! (Gets up and starts running out of the coffee shop) I hate Festivus!
What should I do?
George.. (She doesn't seem to recognize him) George Costanza.
Yeah, and she's going to find I'm a moron. You know, people think I'm smart, but I'm not smart.
( to Jerry) What about the letter, should I think about the letter?
June. Juune, baby!
Maybe he didnt show up.
Well, what is that? That's a crime! Do you know how hot those things get? They should be wearing cotton.
Oh, you lying little snot. And he's a cheater. Aren't ya' you little twerp?
Well, she doesn't really want to see Firestorm.
So dont finish it.
Oh geeeee. (George pantomimes sticking a knife in his heart, and twists it.) Go, go!
You know a hug definitely good.
yeah
Jerry, would you make the call already?
How are we gonna get out of here? We need a plan!
That reminds me, I'm not getting you guys any more fruit. That guy was eyeballing me the whole time. He gave me the creeps. All right, you owe me twenty-eight sixty.
So, you gonna buy his art?
Just when I was doing great. I told you God wouldn't let me be successful.
The one with the long sideburns?
(excited) So then, as we were leaving, we were just kind of standing there, and she was sort of smiling at me, and I wasnt sure if she wanted me to ask her out, because when women smile at me I dont know what it means. Sometimes I interpret it like theyre psychotic or something and I dont know if Im supposed to smile back, I dont know what to do. So I just stood there like  remember how Quayle looked when Benson gave him that Kennedy line? Thats what I looked like.
Hey, Buck. Talk to you for a second?
Or something. I said, Or Something!
So, Lena was upset, huh?
(Attempting to spell his last name) D-A-L-R-I-M-P-E-L?
She didn't want to come, she-she's not really into sports.
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, go. Go about your business, I'll just wander around.
Look, why couldn't you make me an architect? You know I always wanted to pretend that I was an architect. Well I-I'm supposed to see her tomorrow, I-I-I'm gonna tell her what's goin on. I mean maybe she just likes me for me.
I don't see any way around it.
She wants to talk to you.
Know what? Ponce De Leon is sold out.
alright alright
Let me digest it. Let me get my money's worth. Y'know what would be good is if there was someone else in the bathroom that could tell me.
Listen, I have a tremendous favor to ask.
No, no, no we'll talk about it later.
Really? What happened?
You see?.. You see?!
What're.. What're you talking about?
What? You dont like this?
Why didn't anything happen between you two?
Yeah, so what? I'm not the only one! (Kramer enters with his quilt.)
Been there, done that.
Oh..
All right. I will see you boys later.
I know, they're out of their minds! It's fantastic!
(urgent) Move a pinkie, if it's yes. Can you move a pinkie?
Yeah, now I gotcha! (hangs up the phone and rushes out the door)
(calling to Susan) Uh, ah, nothing. Nothing.
What are you talking about.. I WANT MY CAR!!
I keep wracking my brain to try and figure out what I did. I was smart, I was funny, I made great small talk with the waitress so she could see I could relate to the commoners, you know, I'm a man of the people.
Yeah you made it, how about that.
They are?
An' wait'll you see the dress that she's got. It's backless! Uh?! I'm finally gonna make a Great Entrance!
Why? What's wrong with the subject? This is a bad subject?
What is this? This is a drawing.
(snaps fingers) There you go.
I don't understand women.
Okay, what are we gonna do?
Im starving. You got any of those free donuts you use to soften people up?
And I can make a left turn from the right lane too.
Really, I was, I was only kidding around.
For a mental patient. Wait a minute, the phone, we'll call the police.
Yeah, my wife couldnt make it today. Shes got something with her mother... Who knows whats going on with her. Dont let any one kid you, its tough.
That's... what we used to call him in high school, the exterminator. He's a linebacker. Oh, did we have some wild times.
(standing up, still acting) Uhh! I'm caught in my own web of lies! (holds his hands up in surrender)
Mr. Tuttle, you're back.
(Looking over the writing materials they just bought) Bics? What, d'ja get, bics?
(frustrated) Not necessarily.
Boy that-that bank clock is-is eight minutes off.
Oh, no. No no no no no. Id have to advise against that. What, do you know this woman a month? Lets see, youre going to be with her seventy-two hours. Thats a dating decathlon.
Because I know him too, and probably a lot better than you.
(Interested) I should!
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm terribly sorry.. (Bends down, and starts picking up her things)
(starts to try to get passed Jerry and Elaine) Alright get out of my way. (Jerry and Elaine push him back, George very annoyed) Alright don't make me get physical here!
I thought the thing you said about the sex not being simulated . That was really funny.
Yes.
Oh, my God...
I am not O'Brien! I am not O'Brien! I'm not O'Brien! Ask anyone! Jerry?! Jerry?!!
Soda. S-O-D-A. Soda.
Wa, uh, thank you sir, you know I am not quite sure I'm right for it.
Thanks, see you later, Donna.
Ah, that is disgusting--
Oh what's the difference? We'll all be dead eventually.
Why was he wearing a cape?
She, uh, went shopping for some shoes for the wedding and, yada yada yada, I'll see her in six to eight months. (Kramer and Julie enter)
I can't go in there. Im too uncomfortable.
Yeah, no pop-in, no "in the neighborhood," no "I saw your light was on." And the best part is, if things go really well...
Yeah, but if you still look closely you can see ah, a little bump where the nose use to be. huhuhuhu.
Kramer, Kramer, I need to know if Nina is refunding.
Only if you buy. I gotta make a sale.
Especially her. She does not like disappointment. Well, I have to do it. I can't make December. There's no way I can make December. Right? I mean, you can see that, right? I mean, look at me. Look. Look. Can I make December? I can't make December. Right? Look. Look.
Well you should have been O'Brien.
Morning, dad.
He wouldn't put it on if he didn't like it.
(whispering) Glenda, can I ask you a favor? Can I have this seat?
so, uh, Steven.. I see you're president of the chess club.
I couldn't. You know, if it's not about sports, I find it very hard to concentrate.
How do women know about shrinkage?
Hey.
A what?
Right here. (showing his lip)
I got a feeling I'm gonna be much smarter than you pretty soon.
This car out there is taking up, like, three parking spaces.
Yeah, Like I don't know that I'm pathetic.
(worried now) No sir.
Nose. (chuckles) What's the worst that can happen to a nose? What does it get? Stuffed? (chuckles)
Well, some of 'em look good. The ones that look good you don't even know about.
Krama. Please.
Well, you know, I was thinking about what you said before, and...you're right, I've never really been a couple, so...if that's the rule, then I'm gonna go by the rule.
You don't tell him?
Ha ha ha ha, oh all right, go ahead, deride, deride if you must. But let me tell you something, with my personality and this set of hair, you know what I am now? I am in the game. I no longer defer to the coifed. I'm a player.
(cont'd) she says, We have to talk.
Yeah?
Maybe we should call her.
Just a suggestion. (chuckles and walks back to the yelling guy)
Its George.
Yeah, sure, we met at Jerry Seinfeld's apartment. When you fumigated for fleas over there.
You know, suddenly I'm in the mood for pasta primavera myself. (Jerry nudges George to sneak a peek at Molly's cleavage as she bends over and looks in her backpack. Jerry has a quick look, but George stares, hypnotized. Russell comes up behind George.)
How do you know him?
You can't tell him the truth, you're gonna blow the whole thing.
Now I know what I am supposed to do. It's so simple. Tell the truth That's all. Just tell the truth
(pointedly to Elaine) Oh. Thanks very much for yesterday, by the way.
Oh that's OK, really, don't worry about it.
No, the cushion's turned over.
(Shocked) She's pregnant? Leslie is pregnant?! Oh, see, there is no justice.
This was supposed to be 'The summer of George'! The summer of George.
Yeah, yeah, me to miss -- I miss.
So you're gonna let me get suspended for shower urination?
I once told a woman that I really enjoy spending time with my family.
Hey. How come I didn't get a Christmas card? Everybody else got one. Jerry got one, Kramer got one. I thought we were good friends. I don't get a Christmas card. I don't get it.
Ah-Ha! (he turns and walks over to the refrigerator)
(Embarrassed) That's all I could find. (A moment passes) Would you mind getting the door?
You didn't?
A bench? What kind of a bench?
Where did you get that from?
Oh, shut up!
I, I, I can't.
Oh shut up.
Well I'm very excited about this. I've always wanted to see how those sketch artists do it.
"George would never do anything like that."
They're cuffing him.
She seems like an it.
Oh, no...no, that's very bad for the kidneys.
Come on. Come on.
Listen. I want you guys to send along those agreements the minute you land. Our boys can't wait to kick your butts!
If anyone should be forced to leave that place, it should be her!
... Susan.
What if she discusses it with Jane?
Ill be right here.
So what's the deal they don't want to have dinner with my parents?
You won't regret this, sir.
Do you know the last time I wore this thing? Six years ago, when I made that toast at Bobby Leighton's wedding.
Yeah, well, I guess the only thing I can do is go into George Steinbrenners office and tell him he has to give her a raise.
All right, I gotta make a call. Everybody out, come on.
Go, go, get out, ...
Ah hah. You see Father, Im Im incredibly anxious to become a member. Um, dont you offer any kind of an express conversion? A quick change?
Well, does he wear bland, drab, olive colored clothing?
U-ok. (George closes the window and shoos Elaine off. He opens the door to Monica.) Here you go.
She calls you today and she doesnt make a plan for tomorrow? What is that? Its Saturday night!
Your hose! Where's your hose?!
(whistling)
(frantic) Jerry! Jerry, muh--muh--my hair-dryer ruined the picture! An' I need another one or I can't get back into the forbidden city!
Twix.. (Makes various noises) B-5.
Why not? What do I care?
You want me to come back? Uh...
Oh-ho, yeah?
Oh, you might want to stick around Jerry. Mr. Thomassoulo picked the wrong man to hire because he was fake handicapped.
Hey, was that a joke about Houdini?
People always leave old things in their medicine cabinet.
Just dropped in for a visit. You, uh, you never called me back.
(Laughs) You, I guess, you don't remember me.. but we actually, kind of um.. went out.. a couple of years ago.. once.. remember?
(resentfully dampened) It's not a prom. It's a Ball.
Yes, good for me!
So, she was switching? Back and forth?
Yes, now. It's gonna take a few days and my parents are gonna be back. I gotta have it back before them!
Uh, nothing, lets get going. Come on. (laughs) hu hu.
Yes, a shame. That is exactly how I would put it. Now Mrs. Sweedler, with all due discretion and sensitivity, and taking in the whole scope of the situation, I just can't help but think that, the hospital is somehow responsible for compensating the other, still living 'victim' of horrendous, horrendous tragedy.
You yearn.
You're right, how did I miss that? (Begins unlocking the door, mutters under his breath) Maybe because it's a crock of shit.
What, I can't stop by and visit my parents? (Drops pamphlet on coffee table)
Sorry, the card says Moops.
What I said? I say stupid things all the time I can't go two minutes without saying stupid things.
That's unbelievable.
I froze. I think I'm losing it.
I'm starving...
(confessing) Well, actually, I thought it up on the way over here.
She's playing a recital this week at the McBierney School. You wanna hear her play? I got two extra tickets, you and Elaine could go...
Missing his plane? Wasn't that a charter flight?
Oh, me, me, me, me, me!
Yeah, well I uh got lots of other stuff to show you too. Wait till you see the plum job that I landed.
Oh! Great!
Well, that's a given.
Oh ah, I uh, will have that for you by after lunch.
So she doesn't want to see me anymore.
Gimme a half-hour.
No, no. I reached down and there was *nothing* there.
Hey Elainie. What's going on?
So, I ran into the Rosses again.
Leslie.
I know what the problem is - I like her too much. That's why I can't make a move.
Lets not forget the radiator. The steam has been on here for ten years. No human can turn this off.
Interference! You cant count that! Come on, are you crazy?! The coin cannot touch anything, it affects it.
(to the guy next to him) This guy stinks. (speaking of Michael)
No, I won't.
(OC) It's George.
Carol, thats so rude. Please, Im serious, just for a moment, if you wouldnt mind. And then well talk to Jerry.
You're fresh (grabs her arm) You're very fresh. You seem very fresh to me. You're very vital. I couldn't take you any fresher.
(Sheepishly to Elaine) I'll be right back. (Leaves)
Ah, shut up, Jerry. My parents think they can ignore me. Heh heh. Well, they better think again.
Where you going? I-I thought I could count on you for a little compassion.
I dont know. I cant believe theyre making me take this test.
One left...what a joke.
Strawberry, Cranberry ...
What, a 'little' cologne.
During that period when my folks were separated he went a little crazy.
Are you crazy?! What are you doing?! You'll get us killed!
Hey, what are you doing?
(removing his glasses) You know, Hawaii could be a little tricky right now, there's a lot of high pressure winds down there this time of year, there's a lot of debris constantly flying around. Wood, and uh, lava, pretty dangerous.
You're choking me.
Sometimes it's good to have a pencil to write these things down.
Y'know, the funny thing is, somehow I find her more appealing now... It's like if I knew she was a lesbian when we went out, I never would've broken up with her.
Is she socially awkward?
"You sell them?"
You know, you go out, you get another rye. Of course, it would have to be the same one from Schnitzer's. You put it in the kitchen somewhere and you say Ohh! There it is.
My car! My caaaaarrrr!
Elaine.
You won the choose.
Well if you didn't think I was parking, why did you put it in head first?
Hey.
I cant do it. Ill, Ill keep her busy.
Nah.
I hate him!
What about architect, Steven?
Ah Ha.
(To Jerry) Jerk off.
What are you doing?...She had those nuts in her mouth, she just spit them out.
(Sarcastic) Yeah, performance artist. She's a real performer. A real trooper.
Oh, well, I'm sure you can reach her...she's a poet. What does a poet need an unlisted number for?
I have to have my tonsils taken out.
You'll have your turn! The truth must be heard. (Plays back the tape.) That's all there was. And yet, it speaks volumes. A low rumple. A metallic 'squink.' A 'glonk.' Someone crying out..."Dear God!" Let's start with, uh...with you, Wyck.
She bought.
I dont know where the nurse is. Sweetheart why dont you get a nurse for mommy?  Anyway I was just curious. Remember the other day you were saying something about my trip.
A bubble boy?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. But then, I said to him, 'Oh yeah? Well, the jerk store called, and they're running outta you.'
What are you like a sadist? No matter how bad somebody feels, you can make 'em feel worse. I bet you're rooting for a tumor. (pointing to her)
Hey Deena, come on, give us a hug. (they hug) Oh my gosh, you look as pretty as you did back in high school.
You do?
Hey, speaking of which, I found a great way to separate the skin from the top of the pudding without leaving any around the edges; Exacto knife.
You don't trust my poker face?
Really? (Realizes) Well, you don't think it had anything to do with what I said, do you?
No, you see? You got greedy.
Yeah, he was talking to Marla.
Can I come upstairs, please? (Elaine pushes the button and lets George in.)
(getting animated) Yeah. Yeah. You know the odds of me being anyone's type?! I have never been anyone's type, but apparently, this Marisa Tomei loves funny, quirky, bald men.
If I didnt put that floss in my pocket, Id be crawling around her bedroom right now looking for my glasses.
Honesty, hard-work, these are the values that I was raised on. The most important thing Joey, is to be able to look yourself in the mirror before you go to sleep at night.
She called my office. She said shes been in the Hamptons since Sunday. She didnt know if I was trying to get in touch with her. Her machine broke, and shes been using her old machine and she doesnt have the beeper for it.
Hey, is that Tim Whatley?
You dont have to call that! Thats a rule!
Sometimes, once in a while.
Oh, very refreshing. (Thinking again) Sex is like joining a private club. I'll be the same me tomorrow, but suddenly, the no trespassing sign will be gone.
You know what you should do? You should tell this guy you're seeing somebody else. That's the easiest way to get out of these things.
So you lied to her?
What's your name?
You know I uh, spilled a yogurt smoothie in here two days ago. Hm, Can't smell anything, can ya?
I knew it.
We did a crossword puzzle together, *in bed*. It was the most fun I ever had in my entire life. Did you hear me? in my *life*! Y'know?
No, no, pff...
Well, I am just a T-bone kinda guy. Love that T-bone. In fact, you might as well call me--
Well. Gotta motor.
Heh, Mercury head. You mind?
Well, it would be OK if Darryl was here.
Why not?
Jody's nice.
If she'd just take a plane somewhere.
(upset) I *told* you the Drake was bad! I hate the Drake!
So, how was the trip?
Really?
(remorsefully) I can't go.
Ya gotta put on a show, ya always gotta give them a big show. You always have to be 'on' otherwise why would they like me? They'd just go for a better looking guy with more money.
Why? Because we're a team! C'mon! Would you take this for us, dear? Thank you very much. Here we go... (To Morgan) Anyone ever tell you you look a lot like Sugar Ray Leonard? Yeah, you must get that all the time.
I think things were going ok. We were having a nice conversation.
I didn't get the special, but I'd also like the fresh fruit too.
The plane's been re-routed *back* to Kennedy. We've got 45 minutes.
All right, if she puts the bags down before she greets you, thats a good sign.
here Elaine here, Superman (hands a comic book to Elaine, who passes it to Tony) please, next time it will only be the two of us
No, she's taking this course in education for her masters. It's part of her research project, so I have to be a guinea pig.
He started it.
Uh, yeah, I'll be there in a minute.
You're my mother! What wouldn't I do for you?
The table is interference, you know it!
Dad, what's all this?
I have mourned for three long months! Summer months, too! Anybody could grieve in January! It's time for George to start being George again.
Do they pay people to watch movies?
Drink up. (Levitan takes a drink)
I read somewhere that this Brentano's is the place to meet girls in New York.
Oh.
Yeah, let him chew on that for a while.
Ah ah Pez dispenser.
Cleaning them out.
These kids called me a Mary.
I dont know, 120, 130Then they sent some guys to sandblast for 6 hours. Tomorrow they are putting in asbestos.
I'm leaving.
(handing over a bill) Can I get a pack of gum, please?
Alright, bye.
I didn't know you were such a Bette Midler fan.
Like who?
Oh well, I hope he doesn't jum...
Wait a minute? He's picking up the van tonight? This is perfect. I'll drive Rhisa to someplace romantic. Then when my father slides the door open, I'm in the van kissing his brother's daughter.
Me? Oh yeah.
Rudy?! That skunk, I knew he didn't burn those clothes.
Wha, where is he going?
Gammy's gettin' upset!
Im not gonna watch you do laundry.
Alright that's it. (George walks across the room over to them.) So you get rid of me and now the two of you are going to sleep together?
Aah, hey. (enthusiastic) If this works out, forget about it. Vacations together, movies together, dinner together. It..it's almost as good as if I didn't get married.
Any money in it?
(Shrugging it off) She'll be fine. I gotta go to the hospital to see her tonight.
Because I kissed her in the meeting. Russell found out, he fired her over the phone. Finally, my stupidity pays off!
So what! Have a yoke! It won't kill you.
Let me show you something, take a look at this... (Another guy at the party interrupts.)
You see that woman on the horse? (points)
No, there'll be girls there.
Yeah, I may move out there. (getting 'yeah, right' glances from the Rosses) I mean it, I'll do it! OK, I'll see ya later. Keep it real!
Yeah, coy.
Girlfriend, yeah, right.
Yeah?...
It's funny! (To Elaine) and it wouldn't kill you to not be so funny either.
Look at that. Theyre done!
Hello, it's Natalie? Yeah, this is a business office but I'm not a business man per se. I'm here working for the people. Yes, I'm causing dissent. Stirring the pot. Getting people to question the whole rotten system.
(Leaving) I'll store these over at Kramer's apartment.
Yeah!
What are you doing here, I though you were going to the airport.
Yeah, it's the last one.
Why even try anymore? There's no sense to it. I'm never gonna meet anybody, I should just accept it.
Really? (Jerry nods his head) Well, what if it doesnt stop? Oh, that I really needed to hear. That helps a lot! All right, just say something. Just start talking. Change the subject. Lets just go, All right? I cant believe were having dinner with Alton Benes.
Of course he is. There's got to be houses for rent in Tuscany. Do you know how big Tuscany is?
Are, are you sure this is decaf? Wheres the orange indicator?
What if there is a fire?
he..he's alive
I'm going.
She wants me to take an IQ test.
Robin? Robin!
Kramer.
I know. I know. That's what I do. That's what I do.
...It was all a terrible misunderstanding, sir. Just five minutes. Just five minutes of your time. (listens) Thank you! Thank you, Mister Dalrimple.
Excuse me, are you the guy with that funny laser?
It was fantastic, Jerry. We wound up talking all night.
What, are you crazy? I can't have a man touching me. Switch with me.
Did you get the shot?
I can't believe you're really going out with a woman named Lois.
So, if Susan and I had... I mean, if the envelopes hadn't, uh... then we--
What, ... you are making some wisecracks in a night club... wo wo wo. The guy was in game SIX two runs down two outs facing elimination.
So go ahead pigeons. hu hu hu. Laugh it up. I'm getting in my car now and the last I heard ... we have NO DEAL!
Whoop! Too late. I think he picked up the scent.
Muffin, sandwich and coffee!
Maybe.
What?!
I knew this was gonna happen some day. It was inevitable. I've known it ever since I was a little kid. I've been waiting for it.
My parents. It's their anniversary. I'm taking them out to dinner and a show tonight. You think we'll hit traffic?
A mental institution.
Its a great thrill to meet you, Sir.
You think?
(on tape, singing) "Believe it or not, George, isn't at home, please leave a mes-saaage at the beep. I must be out or I'd pick up the pho-one. Where could I be? Believe it or not, I'm not hooome." (beep)
Come on! No doctor would put that on his car.
(checking the fridge) No Chinese leftovers. George is gettin' suspicious.
My father had a car salesman buddy. He was gonna fix him up real nice. Next thing I know, Im gettin dropped of in a Le Car with a fabric sunroof. All the kids are shoutin at me, "Hey, Le George! Bonjour, Le George! Lets stuff Le George in Le Locker!"
Hey look, he's back.
This is horrible.
We'll ask him. (opens partition) My dear fellow, where are you dropping us?
No. That's disgusting!
Nobody's hiring now. The market's terrible.
One... (Glenda seeing George is serious; gets up and leaves)
Looks pretty good.
No, wait!
Uh, well, you know,...
I don't know, what do women say?
"There may be a problem with the phone, hold on"!
Well, just tell Kramer to tell her.
Vandelay!
All right. All right. (They both leave)
How could I possibly interfere?
Where'd you meet her?
The man in the cape--I bet you he is mixed up in this! I don't trust men in capes.
I'll tell you what, why don't you read this book and let's just see if you can explain it to me.
Now, fellas, fellas.. easy. You wouldn't want to beat up on one of your own.
Come on. We got all day tomorrow to come up with a story.
The show is about nothing.
No, no, this is supposed to go to Joe Mayo's apartment.
Beautiful.
Are you through?
(Nervous, his voice cracks) Hey, Antonio. How's it going?
These old guys, they're up at 4 a.m., by two thirty they're wiped. (animated) How did we get back onto you?!
You can't - huhu, All right let's go.
Hey, look, Kramer,
Wh-Well maybe you should ask Elaine.
Yeah, you gotta watch for the jellyfish.
Well, thank you for your support.
Let's test him. Hey, driver. What do you say we stop off, pick up your sister, have a little fun back here? No, he can't hear us.
Ha, because I love Drakes Coffee Cake.
(Trying to keep it down) Because I like this one! (Notices people staring at him, he quickly gets up, collecting the his coat and the tiny replica) C'mon, let's go. Let's go! (On his way out, he stops in front of a woman blocking his path) Oh, hi.. (Embarrassed about the doll, he sheepishly walks out)
Huh. (Makes a "over his head" gesture with his arm) C'mon, let's go, go. We got a lot of work to do today.
How could she leave us alone with this lunatic? Ten more minutes, and thats it! Im leaving. I have to tell you, this guy scares me.
W-What? What?
So fast? What about me?
It's beautiful. She makes all the plans. I'm not from around here so it's okay if I'm stupid, and she knows I'm only in town visiting so there's no messy breakup
(Not wanting to make Elaine mad) I guess it's not important.
It's alright, I got lunch.
I wanna know what I did to this woman.
No. Thanks, dad.
Stay back! (Runs out of the room, pushing Jerry out ahead of him)
(smiling) Yes sir.
Hey, what's another million, give or take. I get off where and when I wanna get off.
It happens.
Keith Hernandez? The baseball player?
I show up.
I like to get the Daily News!
(relishing) Hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm. Delicious.
Uh, I'm sorry, I can't do this..
You had dinner with the Seinfelds'?
Stacey.
(grabbing his jacket) Hey oo, I just remembered uh my parents really wanna have you guys over for dinner before you leave town. What about tonight?
No, it's, it's his. (indicates Jerry)
All right. At last, we're finally gettin' out of here.
Look, we're wasting our time here! We're a half-hour late, they've probably took it off the board already.
Well, I'm sure at some point between the years 800 and 1200--somewhere--there were two women living together.
Alright, what are we getting? It's hot in here!
Of course.
Well, that doesn't mean anything!
The comedian, or the manager?
Yeah! Right!
(getting up) Can I keep this?
So?
Oh!, he he, It was unbelievable
Ha.
Judgement, Jerry, judgement! You exercised no judgement.
He's a sports writer for the daily news. I find him very insightful...
Yo.
Kramer was on Murphy Brown?
(he thinks a little about it... and as he puts his hand on his knee and gets up) I'm sorry Karen. I know I care for you, but I just can't stand when someone doesn't like me. (he opens the door)
Why you going home for?
Will you marry me?
Oh...uh, because if it had anything at all to do with what you perceived as me leering at your daughter, I really have to take issue with that. I did not leer. (To Jerry) Did I leer?
Vivian!!
Yeah, you know, what'd she uh, look like?
There's nothing to talk about.
she's there, I can hear her
Ah, come on
May I just use your bathroom for a moment?
All right.........I've become attracted to Elaine..
So, what? We're gonna do nothing now, this is crazy.
Just take the cap off!
Of course not. You don't care what I look like.
(Fake sympathy) Well, my mother, Jerry..
Because I'm REFRESHED. I finally found a way to sleep in my office. Under the desk. I lie on my back. I tuck in the chair. I'm invisible.
You mean, uh..?
Oh my God. I must be crazy. What have I done?
No, no, the machine'll get it...
She's leaving me dirty messages on my answering machine.
Uh, it's only a matter of time.
Yeah?
Ya manufacture it.
Oh, I could do it.
Well it's not up my alley! It's one thing if I make it up. I know what I'm doin, I know my alleys! You got me in the Galapagos Islands livin' with the turtles, I don't know where the hell I am.
What kind of noodle do you want?
Yes ... yes, yes
Yeah. Good weekend.
How's her handshake? A little firm, isn't it? Maybe a little too firm?
(crafty) Not necessarily. Why don't you take back the couch you gave me?
When are they gonna have the flying cars, already?
I like Christian rock. It's very positive. It's not like those real musicians who think they're so cool and hip.
20 thousand dollars?
You thought she was good looking, right?
Eighty-six, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, ninety, ninety-one... Yup.
Uh, anyway, (Waving bye to everyone) onward and upward.
What, wha, what're you talkin' about?
He didnt seem too pleased.
What!?
I don't have a flush.
Okay, how about this? All right, we get married March 21st, the first day of Spring.
It's an inter-office envelope. It get passed around all over the office.
Oh, no, that's just the old, uh, the old handicap acting up.
Hehehe. .(feebly)
Ow! Dad...
(talking from bathroom) Witness?
I can't tell you, don't ask.
I gotta call her. Should I call her?
Sorry, we're a little late. We got so hung up in traffic.
Yes, yes, but uh, I have to make a call, so...
I tell you; I'm wiped.
Come on, Im tired.
(shouts) Wait! Yes! That's what I should've said! (frustration) D'ohh!
Oh, come on, it's five minutes.
Elaine, get off the speaker! (Elaine picks up phone)
Its been a long night. You go home and get some sleep.
You see if I stay the whole year, I get it all.
I have tell you, I'm pretty impressed with the first one.
No, no. I just got here. A few minutes ago.
Well, I think you should drop him down to Step Two.
Everybody likes pesto. You walk into a restaurant, that's all you hear - pesto, pesto, pesto.
June, June, June.
(pointing outside) Why is there a Cadillac parked in front of the house?
I'm gonna get a Chow Fung.
There you go, okay? That's my *other* friend's ticket. You happy now? You got two tickets.
he he (laughs)
Won't be a problem...(mumbles)
What trying to get off the phone?
Theres just no justice. This experience has changed me. Its made me more cynical, more bitter, more jaded.
You think?
No I'm not. I *was* bald.
You won't think I'm a bad person?
So she's just sitting there, she's having a pleasant conversation... and all of a sudden.
(glances upwards) Yeah. Uhm, why did she die so young?
Who gets picked off in softball? Its unheard of.
All right, Dad, we're five blocks from the house. Sit sideways.
Bender? He cant play left. He stinks. I just dont see what purpose is it gonna serve your going? I mean, you think dead peole care whos at their funeral? They dont even know theyre having a funeral. Its not like shes hanging out in the back going, I cant believe Jerry didnt show up.
There has got to be some way to get back into Pisano's.
You know she was behind the idea. She was going to champion the show. That's what I was bring her up there to tell you. And she liked me.
Oh no no no. He's deeply in love, and I was just about to break up with her when she told me.
Was the alarm on?
Well, I still think you shoulda told me.
It's a talent I have.
Good.
Start what?
Jerry! I need you to get another picture of man-hands. I'm beggin' you!
I walked in, your lobby door is broken again.
What kind of a sick, demented person wants another person's glasses?
He poked me!
You ask me here to have lunch, tell me you slept with Elaine, and then say you're not in the mood for details. Now you listen to me. I want details and I want them right now. I don't have a job, I have no place to go. You're not in the mood? Well you get in the mood!
You know, I think we really need to be in front of a television set. You take T.V. out of this relationship, it is *just* torture.
How ya doin'?
It was on a magazine! And it still had the doily on.
Do you have your bathing suits?
Umm, Im not. Its just a sociological experiment!
(Defensively) You can look at them, but do NOT touch them. (Holds them out)
So I spoke a little to your little friend Denise last night.
Vinyl yeah, maybe.
Well if you and I ever got into, like a really serious fight you know, and the punches started flying -- who do you think would win?
I know! I was squinting.
Who's your favorite chess player?
My credit card?
Oh, hey, sorry I'm late.
I tought I picked up a little something. I'm very good at this. Did you pick up anything?
That's perfect! He's a zoo guy! He take's care of animals. C-Can I bring the squirrel by?
What was that?
I cant believe- (falls on his knees) WE ALREADY DISCUSSED THIS!
Yeah, it's me sir. It's been a harrowing few days. uuh,After the car accident, I-I crawled into a ditch, and managed to survive on, grubs and puddle water, until a kindly old gentleman picked me up.
(absently leaving with it) Thanks.
Goldfish.
Right. And, and to cover my nervousness I started eating an apple, because I think if they hear you chewing on the other end of the phone, it makes you sound casual.
I've said that before?
Is that right?
Hi...
All right go ahead Susan, tell him.
Hey Alec
Where did this come from all of a sudden?
Kimbrough.
(cuts into Jerry talking) Chocolate chip mint? Oh well, actually Jerry I prefer chocolate chip. What is it about the chocolate and the mint that makes it go so well together?
You gonna sleep on the fold-out?
I've done the march in. Best feeling in the world.
(urgent) Mr Wilhelm, listen. You've been abducted! Please, Mr Wilhelm, you gotta listen to me!
Believe me, I am not crazy.
I dont get art.
You're making more than I am.
She happens to be very good friends with her.
You met her at the supermarket? How did you do that?
come on it's just a game.
(Thinking to himself) She's not concerned about the security guard. What kind of a person is this? I'm marrying a person who doesn't care that this man has to stand here 8 hours a day when he could easily be sitting.
Don't leave (George slams the door)
That's not funny. So, are you coming to the party?
Yeah?
But I digress. Let me see, now. You were standing at one end of the line and I was right next to you. And I remember we were even for like, the first five yards and then , BOOM,...You were gone.
Yeah.
Well, I could be a little sweetie tweetie weetie weetie.
Well, why don't *you* go, and I could save the seats. You said you didn't like saving anyway.
What's the decision?
Ah, beat it, punk.
My receipts! The chair! My tiger poster!
I can't tell anymore.
Attention Steinbrenner and front-office morons! Your triumphs mean nothing. You all stink. You can sit on it, and rotate! This is George Costanza. I fear no reprisal. Extension five-one-seven-oh.
I need higher. This has paba in it, I need paba-free.
The thing is...I'm supposed to be T-bone.
Loves bald? (laughs) Wow. Who uh, who is she?
She was a delicate flower.
You didnt say "junior".
How's the trip?
(well, obviously) Yes.
I don't like it, it's red. It it's too flashy.
(George is telling a story. Karen is laughing and she seems to be the only one to find him funny) So I go into this clothing store and the saleswoman is wearing this (whistling) low cut thing. So I said to her "Can I ask you a question? When you put on a top like that, what's your tought process? What's going on in your mind?"
No! No. It's not good, I don't think so.
Costanza. Costanza.
I don't know, I don't know, you'll think of something.
So, what's wrong with him?
What about jewelry? That's very nice gift.
(Struggling) No, no, no, no. I can walk it off. It's a hundred and twenty degrees in here.. I'll sweat it out.
(hearing Elaine over the phone) What, she's out?
I saw Siena again.
Maybe I could be a land guy.
Well she was sending out our wedding invitations.
Let me ask you something. What do you think of this shirt?
Now, see here, doctor.
You mean a walk back in? That's the toughest move in the business. You're sending me out into no-mans-land, and if I get shot down I have to crawl all the way back. Well I can't do it! I can't do it, I tell ya!
Top priority.
Jerry, do you have any fishsticks?
Yeah. Thanks for, thanks for coming by fellas. Eh, got a set of keys, buried in the pothole.
Until that stupid photo jogs his memory.
I got nothing, Jerry. Nothing.
(Pleading) You gotta let me go over there.
(from bathroom) How was Eric Roberts as the husband?
But I'm paying you!
That was a hell of a thing when Spock died...
Jody let's do this agian real soon (he tends his arms for a hug but she avoids him)
Ah! Some bald thing, a bald thing I dunno. It's nothing
No, no, I don't think I'm special. My mother always said I'm not special.
I thought he looked Irish.
So--ah, Kramer. Why'd you ask me out to dinner? (amused) An' why Pomodoro?
(Interrupting) Jerry, No!
I had no idea.
Nougat? Please. I think Ive reached the point in my life where I can tell the difference between nougat and cookie. So lets not just say things that we both know are obvious fabrications.
S-Susan
(Muttering) No, that's it.
(Angered) Fine. I'll ask you again when you're rested.
Oh-ohf (snorts) yeah, I'm a writer. (laughs)
I still don't see why I can't ask her about my arm.
Then why don't you try and get him another job?
Nah.
What happened to the auto show?
It's like I'm Neil Armstrong. I turn around for a sip of Tang and you jump out first.
The shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy, shmmopy, shmoopy!
Oh my God.
Something's going on here.
Well, last night she told me that she liked you. Not you, the disturbed you, so I had to tell her the truth.
(hesitates) Very close, yes. Almost painfully close.
If youre a spirit, and you can travel to other dimensions and galaxies, and find out the mysteries of the universe, you think shes gonna wanna hang around Drexlers funeral home on Ocean Parkway?
Not everybody knows what the crop circles are. (to the newsstand owner) Do you know what the crop circles are?
(George takes out the suit from the other rack) Well, look at this. (innocently) This doesn't belong here! Someone has made a terrible mistake.
(walking towards the door) I couldn't leave well enough alone?!
Reality tour?
Get out of here, why?
Yeah. It's a beautiful name for a boy or a girl...
We're straightening out!
He's a wig master
She cant even afford to go out to lunch. She's been eating in a high school cafeterias She pretends to be a teacher. It's pathetic.
I gotta prep. I need a couple of anecdotes, a few you-were-right-abouts. It's a whole procedure. Wasn't Fragile Frankie the one that used to run into the woods every time he got upset?
The psychic said something terrible will happen.
I know a little. Besides, what do you have to know?
I wouldn't hear of it, Todd. It's none of my business. But you should try to find out everything you possibly can. In fact, I'll even stay all the way on the other side of the room just so there's no chance of me overhearing anything.
(laughs-hu) So when're you gonna see her?
Yeah. You like it.
Well, I join them in their grief.
Fitted Hat Day! That's what you asked Steinbrenner for?
Mmm-hmm. You reneged.
Okay.
How much you pay this maid?
Oh.. nice.
He knows?
What d'you mean, let 'em go? They're spending all my money.
(he walks casually to Tom, and taps his arm) Listen. I know we've had our problems in the past, but we got a show to do tonight. Time to pull together as a team. Life's too short. I say, let's let bygones be bygones. If you took the raisins, if you didn't take the raisins-- They weren't even my raisins. I was just curious because it seems like a strange to do to walk into a room, audition, and to walk out with a box of raisins. Anyway, whatever. If you ever want to tell me about it, the door to my office is always opened. In the event that I get an office. You'll come in, we'll talk about the raisins. We'll have a nice laugh.
Every day she comes in, she sits at that table and reads. Never talks to anybody.
So what did she say?
The nickname. George. What is that? It's nothing. It's got no snap, no zip. I need a nickname that makes people light up.
No, no the full size.
Yes, well you see, the deceased landed on my car. The uh splat, as it were, actually occurred on the roof of my car. Now of course I can't help but feel that had it been a convertible this whole tragedy might have been averted but I've never been the kind of guy to buy a convertible, what with the baldness and everything.
He-he was uh touching and rubbing. (nervous laugh)
You schedule a late meeting.
Beef-A-Reeno? You fed the horse Beef-A-Reeno?!
Alright.
Hello.(with not a big smile)
Alright, that's enough.
But really, it's enough with the bar already.
(to the cab driver) Excuse me, do you see anything on my lip here?
Why?! Because you were stabbed, and.. got coffee thrown in your face, and.. uh.. (Points to Alan's bandaged forehead)
We did?
Ladies and gentlemen, this (Opens the door, Steven is standing there) is Steven Koren. His G.P.A. is a solid 2.0! Right in that meaty part of the curve - not showing off, not falling behind.
All right, let me just... I'm gonna grap an apple.
Any, uh.. progress, there? What's the latest?
Well Dad's been planning this for such a long time, he bought a new blanket, and he got tha...that game with foam paddles and the velcro ball. (laughs)
How come you don't know what street are you on?
Pepe.
Slippery Pete, Kramer tells me you are one hell of a rogue electrician. And shlomo, you're the best truck driver.
The doctors thought he had cancer, but the surgery revealed he never actually had it.
Lowes Paragon, 84th and Broadway.
(Standing up) I just got here, Ma! I'd like to spend a little time with you.
Korea.
Ma, your eyes!
Do you hear that?
It's right in the explosion scene. So if you could just...leave me a little window. You know, my, uh, my aunt had a thing removed with a laser. All right, I don't want to interrupt your meal, so...
Well, did you see it?
So call her up and tell her to bring you another one. She'll be delighted to talk to you.
So, that's it. All of my darkest fears, and... everything I'm capable of. That's me.
Eh, gee, I hope you have the key for these things.
I can't carry a pen. I'm afraid I'll puncture my scrotum.
Kramer, can we do this later..
Jerry said he didn't like it.
So what, he's got a couple of good jokes.
So you're against me now?
I can't to myself. I'm exhausted.
Are you coming back down?
Can you believe he sold his glasses on the street?
I'm gonna go with you. I gotta get a new suit. I got a second interview with MacKenzie, and I think I'm really close. They're all taking me out to lunch on Friday.
I had a fight with Susan.
I'm pretty sure I wouldn't.
(yelling) Awright, let's just stay calm here! Don't get all crazy on me!
No, I, uh, um, wa, wa, What did I do? ... Where are you going?
(upset) But you can't stay here. There's no place to sleep!
Clock over there. (to chauffer) O'Brien.
(laughs) Not quite.
You still owe me a secret.
I know. It's Mickey Mantle's number. So not only is it an all around beautiful name, it is also a living tribute.
I think hitting a defenseless child is my business.
How about Chinese?
Five thousand... Ten. Ten thousand. Five thousand.
Kramer, what are you talking about...Janet doesn't look anything like Jerry
Howbout Kramer or Elaine, they don't want them?
Nothing at all.
How come this sweater is only 85 dollars?
Is it? (reaches into bag)
I don't know. I don't think you're anything.
Kramer was supposed to tie a knot
It wasn't down in, it was sort of on top.
Fifty bucks a month, that's incredible! Okay, thanks.
Not the feats of strength..
Hey. I gotta go.
I gotta go help her tape up all his boxes and get them ready for shipping.
(To Jane) You know, when I was a kid, I once found a dollar and fifty cents in change on the bottom of the pool.
It's good. Believe me.
Ah, well, you know we gotta been running because of the ...
All right, just gimme that. And gimme some of those Sweet & Lows.
What the hell is going on here?
Well, Jerry's car gets hit and the other driver doesn't have any insurance, so the judge
He's the guy we're the buying the chair for, remember? It was your suggestion.
You see what just happened here?
So I really liked the pictures I picked up here yesterday.
What about a letter?
Sir?
Why would I spend seven dollars to see a movie that I could watch on TV?
nothing
How can you compare you parents to my parents?!
I knew it!! (shuts cab door) I predicted it! (hits cab roof twice, it drives off) Saw both of them today! What a disaster! I'm runnin' all over Queens. First I saw my mother. We had lunch together. Never had... LUNCH with my mother before--it's like a date! Then we drive down to Kew Gardens! Tons of traffic! I see my father. We played "Clue"! All day with this! [Kew Gardens (see links at end of script)]
Hello! All right, we should be going. Come on...
Every night at six-thirty. The nurse was gorgeous.. then I got a look at the patient.. (Laughs, then snorts) I was going nuts.
Yeah. Yes! I just haven't seen you in a long time.
Well uh....
I have to rewind it first. (George presses the rewind button on the tape recorder. He and Jerry stand there, waiting impatiently as it rewinds.) Alright, alright.
I don't know.
(nervous) All right now we're going bye bye.
That is what Mr. Steinbrenner wants. He wants, everyone, ta, twirl around.
Well, uh, are there any other options?
(shocked) When do I start?
Wait a minute, you were at a funeral, right?
It's not a pet! It's a wild invalid! And it knows that I tried to kill it. As soon as it gets better, it's gonna gnaw my brain out in my sleep!
No, I'm fine. I'm good. I'm very good.
All right. That's enough for today. You're tired. Get some sleep. I'll see you first thing in the morning.
Oh my god he's not kidding. (exhale gasp)
" That guy was amazing, he could dunk and he was my height...What was his name again?"
Uh, Jerry, you want your blankets tucked in?
I bet they're probably doing summersaults about us over there. You think they get butler stories like that everyday? (He calls Susan)
You do.
Whats in it?
Well, Dr, Allenwood, uh...I was hoping to compile an - admittedly, rudimentary - scrapbook of her life. Something that Betsy could have, and hold onto.
Well, it's less than twenty-four hours, so I guess I have to!
Hey.
It was you!
What's that?
(to Kramer) What about your stuff?
Look who's here!
Well good, good. Take it off you're going to wear it out already. It's for special occasions this thing.
They did?
Tim, who's the head of the Aryan Union, you or me?
Don't be soured.
Oh, when is that car service coming?
I would imagine it's all naked.
What?
(Standing up, still waking up) Alright, you know what we should do? We should go to the movies. Get away from this script for a while..
Mr Wilhelm? Wha..what're you doing here?
Yeah.
So, was it me?
...velay.
But I'm not a marine biologist!
To be polite. I rest my case.
What?
(Makes a gesture saying he understands. The man nods) But how.. uh..?
Hey, Mr. Morgan how was your massage?
Yes! How're we gonna do that?
Uh, heading out. Jerry really hates to miss the coming attractions.
Well, my father works for the United Volunteers, maybe he can get her one.
Who is Sir Arthur Conan Doyle?
Above the rim.
Yeah, it's bizarre. (they both look around them suspiciously)
She just dislikes me so much... It's irresistable.
what?.. that's ridiculous!
Well, I'm the good boy again. Can you believe that?
An apartment complex, the uh the Eiffel Towers. uumm Like I said uh you'll be getting a postcard uh in a few days and again I'm sorry.
Marisa Tomei! I, just spoke to Marisa Tomei! (sitting opposite Elaine) And I wasn't even that nervous.
No you weren't. Stop there, that's fine.
Uh, let me ask you something. You uh, you ever hear of Marisa Tomei?
Oh, this is my friend, Jerry Seinfeld. I just bumped into him around the corner. Isnt that a coincidence? The funny thing is, I see him all the time.
Hope he's not the guy.
And then, (Smacks the money) there were two.
I don't see why's she more self-conscious about that than her toe thumbs.
Oh my god.
That condom killed me. Why do they have to make the wrappers on those things so hard to open?
I cant believe I said that. You know me, Im a vault.
What about me?
I tell you something. I wish there were pig-men. You get a few of these pig-men walking around suddenly I'm looking a whole lot better. Then if somebody wants to fix me up at least they could say, "Hey he's no pig-man!"
Yeah, I'll zip in, "How do you do?", zip out. She'll love me.
If only she could get fired. Is there any way that could happen? I mean I know how to get myself fired.
Canceled? Do I still get credit for the pick up? I was here!
I got him Yankee's tickets! He got me a piece of paper saying "I've given your gift to someone else!"
Well she apologized, and then she wanted to know if we could get together Wednesday afternoon.
Yeah.
Well, uhm, I think I'd like to do it.
Busted cold.
Who's this, Blue Arrow?
Maybe he was going to say "Of course I have to check with my associates."
Are you supposed to yell it?
Thats all there is to it. By Christmas day I will be Brother Costanza.
No, I want to go.
Well no not yet, you gotta buy french stamps (pauses) I-I'll reimburse you of course.
I, I couldnt wait. I was too anxious to see you.
That's Kramer.
If I could talk to the guy for just a sec...
Just..go back. Pretend the whole thing never happened.
I stopped having sex.
Elle McPherson going to be there?
Witness.
You know, I don't see how you can sit there eating that and not even offer me any?
What a fascinating turn of events. (Waitress approaches)
Oh I'm a chucker.
Oh I was not. The BUBBLE BOY was tried to kill me.
Oh, you're dead.
Well I was lost, I never saw the first one. By the way, you mind if I watch it here?
This is just what I need.
The cabin.. (Laughs nervously) Well.. (Pauses as he thinks of a way to break the news, then decides to pass it off) Susan?
(more excitement) You were gonna fix me up with her?
Of course you will. (quick chuckle). You're the best. (with a light fist motion across her chin)
If anything happens here, can I count on you?
No, no thanks.
It's OK. It's fine. She'll do it. I'm sure she'll still do it.
Snoopy and Prickly Pete. Should I keep driving?
What, are you doing me a favor?
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. What about the pact?
(still quiet) The actress.
You want me to find a poem about Susan? May she rest in peace?!
What are you doing?
and JERRY Very nice, very nice, nice.
Sounds like a scam. (takes a bite from the granola bar)
Must be one of those rich, spoiled handicapped people, who didn't want to do any work, and just wanted to sit in her wheelchair and take it easy.
Birthday card?
Well, I guess I'm getting older.
yeah, I ... I snuck a peak. ... But it was so fast I didn't see anything. It was just a blur.
What is this 'saving movies' thing? Something's playing, you go.
Well, lets just leave.
What?
Stop it! It's nothing. It's a stupid holiday my father invented. It doesn't exist!
What ever they had. Miranda thinks I'm a butcher but i-i-it's not my fault is it? Don't we have a deal with the pigeons?
You think she could be an 'it'? Could she be an 'it'?
(pointing at Jerry) Oh, hes the comedian.
You know they used to make leisure suits out of this fabric?
She's bald.
Yes! Yes, all right--anything!
(tasting the wine) Excellent. Like I really know what I'm talking about.
(Pleading) Please, please, they're gonna hit me! (Attempts to grab Helen's purse, she starts hitting George defensively, he backs off)
Anyway, we met with NBC about a month ago and they gave us the green light to go ahead and write a pilot. In fact, we got a big meeting with them tomorrow. They gotta approve of the story before we can write.
If I was a different person.
I have no choice, I'm quitting.
(Annoyed) If that helps you..
They saw me walk out.
Don't worry. We won't forget!
Nothing.
horning on my rock climbing trip. It's just supposed to be me and Tony
What if we grew muttonchops?
Nevertheless. His time has come.
Could we talk about this some other time?
Yes. The New Yorker.
I, I can't believe this is happening!
Huh, No kidding?
Because you're a gymnastics teacher. It's only natural.
Ridiculous!
Yeah.
Can we move on?
Lemme tell you sum'in. When Ponce looked in that mirror and saw that he hadn't changed, and that tear started to roll down his cheek? ... I lost it.
Yes. You know the uh flood, and the uh lepers, and the commandments and all that.
What, is he crazy?
Hello?
I told her. In the kitchen  which was risky cause its near all the knives. I started with the word Listen.
No (snorts - Laughing nervously)... I'm gonna wear black shoes.
Bob Cobb?
Well...I've got a lot to do!
(Sitting on the sofa) I'm on no sleep, bro.
You nervous?
Why would I...
Hey. How's your day, good?
(neither does he) Yeah, well.
Tub is love?
No! I don't! Don't you even care? This is your company! It's your name on the outside of the building! Speaking of which, the 'R' fell off and all it says now is K-uger!
Why?
You're throwing the set?
(embarrassed/self-conscious about his gut) Do I? Thanks.. You too..
I'm not going back in there.
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
Yes.
Are you sure?
Well, yeah.
Well, how about that?
All he has to do now is count his blessings, say a prayer, and he's done. Do you believe this?
I don't know.
Oh, great guy.
I DON'T KNOW. It's this place. I'm very uncomfortable here.
This line is huge.
Anyway, I-I would like to-to pay for the cleaning.
No no no, that's in the right position.
Well today's your lucky day.
Awright, lemme just say this. Ten thousand dollars, alright, and now I'm going below what you wanted to pay. You have your dinner, have your veal, or whatever it is. Enjoy...
Take toilet paper for example. Do you realize that toilet paper has not changed in my lifetime? It's just paper on a cardboard roll, that's it. And in ten thousand years, it will still be exactly the same because really, what else can they do?
Noo!
Wait a second, wait a second...and then the butler says, "I'm not cleanin' it up! I'm sick of cleaning!"
It's stuck on a piece of cloth here. I can't get the cloth out.
All right.
(smiling) Uh, hi. Uhm, remember me? I..I'm the guy who looks like Neil?
Well, Im going with him. Id like to... Ive never done a solid before.
Oh my God! What is that?!
No.
Hey.
(Scoffs) Writer. We're talking about a sit-com.
"These pretzels are making me thirsty!!"
"It doesn't help"
You think you could hook me up with these guys?
Me run in? Why don't you run in?
Keith called you?
Split it. Pretty good. Talk about game six?
No, no. Forget it. I don't want it. Let's just get rid of it.
No, Ill put half a can of mousse in my head like you.
Hey! What is your problem?
What paper does she write for?
It's one think to not give me the extension But to tease and to torture me like this. There's no call for that.
What, you think I could postpone it?
All right, uh, okay, I got it, um, Ill sing.
Aaaaaah
Really? ..You think.
(upset) Could you put a little thought into this? Jerry's gone, you could humour me. He humours me.
Well, Jerry, I been thinkin'. I've gotten as far as I can go with George Costanza.
I know. That's the point. If it's gonna get sexual, it should get sexual with you.
No, you're not out there.
Hide, hide under the desk.
What, is that the one your parents gave you?
I-I'm sure if you weren't satisfied you would probably say something wouldn't you?
I'll shout.
No. Lunch we read, dinner we read.
That's because it's underwater.
Hey, hey. Kramer, what are you doing? You can't smoke in here.
I know I was just telling them the story.
I knew you had an appointment.
Think I'M not?
(still puffing)" Whoa!!"
Did you ever read anything by him?
Hey.
Just as she was. Hey, Mario! Remember us?
(Sliding over to make room for her) Sit down. Join us, please.
I got scared there for a second. The Knicks without Ewing.
You think Kramer'll do it?
So how long did you live there?
Get going? But we haven't really, you know....
Really? They work here in the office?
No. No it's not. You don't know this guy. It woulda been so sweet.
(emerging from bathroom, buttoning his shirt) A gymnast! I can't believe it, you didn't tell me she was a gymnast.
Huh. Really?
Why?
(In awe) Wow!
I never heard him say anything really funny.
Well, maybe not married, but...
All right, all right. Thats it. Im gonna go down there.
I got me an appointment with a hardware store. I'm not saying I want to do it for the rest of my life, but, uh, hardware fascinates me. Don't you love to make a key?
One of your guys - Kip, or Ned, short name - stole my Twix candy bar!
The whole time that I was growing up, all I ever heard from my mother was 'Why can't you be more like that Lloyd Braun?'
Y'know people, we got a situation over here!
You wanted to see me, sir?
(To Kramer) You want to start?
Oohoho...spicy mustard...woohoho, you're hot tonight!
Listen. Let me ask you something. If you and Mona were ever to... dance, how do you decide who leads? I mean... do you take turns? Do you discuss it beforehand? How does that work?
(Not amused with her answer) Eggs are eggs. That is very profound. (laughs; Daphne goes back to reading her paper) By the same token you could say fish is fish. Ha ha ha, I don't think so. (pauses) Listen Dophne
No problem.
Yes and I was hoping ... to get a thirteen week extension.
He's Keith Hernandez. You're Jerry Seinfeld.
(leaving) Alright that's it for me. Good night everybody.
Im an architect.
Im good.
Yeah.
I just don't think it's such a great idea for you to sit here.
You met her a few weeks ago, but...?
Yeah. I got 'em down to fifty bucks. I just have to do all the jackhammering myself.
I don't like when a woman says, 'Make love to me', it's intimidating. The last time a woman said that to me, I wound up apologizing to her.
Na....no ... This relationship he..he..has got to be about something and fast or I'm in very serious and weird trouble....hum What else happened?
Hey.
So, you send me to this therapist to help me with my emotional disorders, and she criticizes our script. (Tosses the script to Jerry.) What kind of a therapist is that?
Are you kidding? People get spaces this good, they never give em up.
What?
(whispering) Elaine, it's me, George.
He dropped it.
(still quiet) Think, a second. You know, your friend was talking about me and, you know...
I know.
What's so funny?
The car!
(Outraged) "That's all"?! That's everything! I don't know what all the rest of it is for anyway!
No no no no no, this has to be carefully orchestrated. You go to a fancy dinner, flowers...
No, no, not really. Ever since Susan passed on, I have good days and bad. (Turns the briefcase towards the woman on his left.) Some days, I'm haunted by one word - why. Why Susan? Why wasn't it me licking those invitations? Why am I still here? Well, I gotta run. (Gets up and leaves the meeting.)
Well this worked out okay. So are you going to see the police woman?
Alright, now you're gonna see some parallel parking. (spitting into his hands and rubbing them together) How I wish you could make a living parallel parking. (turning around in his seat) It's all geometry, knowing all the angles, when to make that first turn and then when to swing it back in, that's the key.
Yeah.
(again from bathroom) Witness.
Oh, Scott, Scott. He's really great, isn't he?
Oh I'm going baby! I'm going! (he leaves)
Really?
Yeah, conjugal visit sex. That is happening!
You mean she just laid there topless?
Not bad? It's gorgeous!
I told her that she was pretentious.
Sounds like a cool guy.
Well, there could be.
(looking at the door) He's starin' at us.
He's not here?
Absolutely...
Ha, uh,
Really? That's pretty good.
Yeah. Never seen anyone so bored. I'm working like a dog here. Give me a moan. *Something*. I'd settle for a belch, for god's sake. All right, come on, let's have it.
Oh, I know.
Oh, sure, my Black Hawks jacket. I love my Black Hawks jacket.
Do we have to...?
All righty, no reason for us to uh, raise our voices.
It's June.Mark's Michelle is a dog.
You can't handle the truth! (he salutes) (imitating Jack Nicholson [a.k.a. Col. Nathan R. Jessep], from the 1992 movie A Few Good Men)
But in the zoo, you know, they might, put a woman in there with me to uh.. you know, get me to mate.
You know my driver's waiting, I really should get running. Good to see you guys again.
Oh, the bookstore girl. How's that goin'?
I don't know, I was starving Jerry!
What?
I haven't even met the fiancee! Whatever! (Leaves for washroom)
All right, let's postpone it. Let's get out of here.
I don't know.
Yes. I like to feel cozy. I have a very small apartment. I like to feel tucked in, nestled in. Love to be nestled.
I take an eye test; I flunk it, the next thing you know I am swinging to the sweet sounds of risk management.
I just got here. My car broke down on the Belt Parkway.
No sports jacket? I don't need a sports jacket? Writers wear sports jackets.
I guess it's on my resume.
Ohh yes, yes. Yes Jerry they were all over me. It was like Rocky 1, Hm. Diane came up to me, threw her arms around me
He'll be back on Monday.
Ya, you go.
I don't know, honey. What do you want to get? [in babying voice] I want you to get anything you want...'cause I love you so much. I want you to be happy. Okay, sweetie?
Did you feel that tension? We use to have banter - (puts menu back with frustration) - there's no more banter.
Oh, the hell with it. Let him kill me. I..
(realizing he was short changed) I was in the pool! I was in the pool!
Smile.
I got some cufflinks I could've loaned you.
Uh, yes, uh...you don't know me, my name is George Costanza...did you happen to rent Breakfast At Tiffany's?
(resolved) Why not. (determined) If she can't find me, she can't break up with me. And, if we're still goin' out, she has to gooo to the ballll.
Well what would be the point of that?
Oh, pudding! You want some?
What about this--
I like history. Civil War. Maybe I could be a professor, or something.
(to Jerry, as Jerry nods in agreement) You know I think she might have something there.
Yeah, woman have no problem getting the hand off. How do they do that?
That was no good?
No problem there. Conformity is an obsession with me.
I think he should wear whatever tie he wants.
(Yelling out to a waitress) Gonna need some water here!
(CONT'D) ...with that group.
Umm... No.
Nooooo.
Oh, you spoiled, spoiled man. Do you now how much mental energy I expend just trying to picture women naked?
Assistant to the travelling secretary. (fishing for a reaction) I'm uh, working on the project.
That's it. That's the line... (squirts mustard into Jerry's coffee and stirs it) ...that destroyed my life.
Oh, this guy tried to sneak into my space.
(to the cashier) Excuse me, I gave you a twenty dollar bill and you only actually gave me change for a ten.
Uh, no. No, we shouldn't.
I look like me and I'm working from the outside. Who do you think is in the better position?
Jerry, can I talk to you for a second? (They enter Jerry's apartment)
Hey. I got Jon Voight's LeBaron. (Jingles the keys.)
What about personality?
(sitting down) Vacation?
Oh you mean face down on her chest.
I cant believe how easy it is. Im virtually Orthodox. All I have to do is read a few books, memorize a few prayers, and Im in the club.
Who says you gotta have a story? Remember when we were waiting for, for that table in that Chinese restaurant that time? That could be a TV show.
All right, I want you to do me a favor.
Forget about smelling the car. Smell the valet. Go to the source...
Without his shirt on.
How are they gonna make that book into a movie?
Wha - what happened? What are you doing back so soon?
Alright, stop it Kramer, you're freakin' me out. (The waitress comes over.)
Do you wanna talk about hotels, or do you wanna win some ball games?
I just wanted to talk to Tony for a minute (hands Elaine some stuff)
I like to stop at the duty free shop.
'Cause believe me, I would only say this to you and maybe a psychiatrist, maybe. Well, her nose is a little big.
Huh?
(to Jerry) Whos going to play left field?
Yeah, like that.
I tell you, when she threw that toupee out the window, it was the best thing that ever happened to me. I feel like my old self again. Totally inadequate, completely insecure, paranoid, neurotic, it's a pleasure.
You didn't ask him?
(animated) What're you talking about?! She's very concerned! She said she was gonna get it back.
You
(mutters it again)
Here we are.
Are the courses open?
(jokingly) Well, so, legally, I could marry your daughter.
I show up. I pretend I have the job. The guy's on vacation. If I have the job, it's fine. If I don't have the job, by the time he comes back, I'm ensconced.
Jerry! I did it! Haha! I beat Braun!
Thanks, Warden.
(ahem) In this age of uncertainty and confusion, a man begins to ask himself certain questions. How can one even begin to put into words something so um (trying to think of a word)
I needed it! My back is... a little tweaked.
You what?
(???), we'll see you in a little while.
Hey, Kramer.
No problem. There's no problem. She just owes me ten dollars, that's all.
What the hell is this? George, Elaine and I went to see Chunnel ... with Jerry. With Jerry, huh? With Jerry! Great. Great! (dials phone) Probably went to the 84th St. That's where I always go with Jerry.
Alright, alright, I'll call Heather, you'll get your hat back, I will get a second date. Ha ha ha. Now watch the magic.
Medium turkey chili.
What?
It's OK.
Volunteer work, huh?
Alright, so that's one tuck and one no-tuck.
Tarragon? Oh, you're crazy.
Didn't hear anything...
Oh, no, no, not at all. No, I have always felt that the most important thing in the world is spending time with family.
What was that?
They gave me the Pensky file.
Oh, yes. Hello.
I-I wasn't in the attic.
Tough.
Who is this Rava?
It's complicated.
The next thing you know, he'll have you driving him to the airport..
This woman drove us out of our minds
Where? (He looks out window and gets hit by a tomato)
Whyie?
Anyway, I don't even get a thank you. I don't get it!
Really? Wow, you're quite the good son.
You got hookers turning tricks in my car. How's that for starters.
"It's the Kom Pau ... George likes his chicken spicy."
(entering the apartment more fully) Oh. Oh, hi, hi. Hi. Nice to meet you. (peering at the table) What're you having, veal?
Artie Schuman? From Camp Hatchapee?
Hunh, pph (raises hands slightly, in amazement) How was it?
You know a lost and found could be a good idea.
Well, I - I could, Uh, I could give the money back. Here. (Holds it out)
This uniform, what's it made from?
Definitely.
She put them in her pocket book. She probably took them out there with her.
I was just curious.
Oh, my god.
Want a bite?
I feel like I got a B12 shot. This is like a taste explosion!
I, I couldn't help but notice that uh you don't have a chair.
I went to the beach. (Jerry and Elaine exchange looks)
Heuh. huh. Stick around a while.
(staring at the wreck) Whatever.
Yeah, yeah. Shes punctual... and uh shes been late, sometimes.
Yeah, Cubans.
Cause its all in the greeting.
I don't understand things were going so great. What happened? Something must have happened.
Ah oh? What? What Ah oh?
What do you mean?
How many people does he do that for?
(entering Monk's) Oh, hello, Hanke, others.
Hi (raises his left hand in a slight gesture to say hi)
(Somewhat angered) She's in traction.
Ya and also I'm afraid that people in that state are finally going to tell me what they really think of me. You know they got nothing to lose what do they care?
He's getting on a bus, damn! (To the blind man) Those are nice glasses.
Uh, excuse me, Wyck. Uh, are we, uh, almost done here?
I'm still watching them.
Maybe I won't send her that check.
What you talking about?
Okay.
Ma?!
Yeah, I would. It's just, you know, I just ate a whole pot roast.
It's my head!
What about it?
Huh?
I'll tell you what I'd like to do. I'd like to replace that rye.
So, I'm gonna steal another one, and then return it. That way, everything is even.
All right, forget that idea, it's not for you....Okay, okay, I got it. You run an antique store.
I...I...write a letter and then I..I go to China. I disappear in a sea of people for like six months, a year you know just while things simmer down. Ehm.. Ehm...Dear Susan. I'm sorry. I made a terrible mistake. I'm really , really sorry.
Oh, Rita. Hey, Mr. Shermack, how're you doing, good to see you. Jay, always a pleasure. (To Susan) Sweetie. (Kisses her and then sits down next to Jerry) Yeah, yeah, that butler idea, that's beautiful. Isn't that killer? (Aside to Jerry) I thought I was getting the butler.
Elaine, don't interrupt, they're discounting something.
Oh, no no, I cant go back there. Jerry, its so awkward and, you know, it could be dangerous sexually. Something could happen, Id be right back where I started from.
That's exactly what I told Jerry!
Right. He cooks my food, he cleans my house, he does all my shopping for me. And there you go, that's your program.
Hello.
Well, I was buttering myself up for a nice shave --
I am staying out all night!
You did that?
Dont you wanna go upstairs first?
Listen to this. Marcy comes up and she tells me her ex-boyfriend was over late last night, and "yada yada yada, I'm really tired today." You don't think she yada yada'd sex.
You said you grabbed it outta there real fast, right?
'Things'll be great, when you're...'
Dad. We need to talk.
My Susan?
So, were talking, and I dont like to go too long before I ask them out, I wanna get it over with right away, so I just blurt out, What are you doing Saturday night?
Because he said I was going to.
Hey, I've eaten frogs, so nobody's perfect. Anyway-
Look at all of those! You're rich!
Yeah, I grabbed it on the way out, I don't want my mother reading it.
You know what, I'll just uh, I'll just look around for a little while. (moving to come round the counter) I'll just browse around.
Yes.
--and this is Kramer.
I was personable. Don't you think I was personable?
Jerry, for all I know this guy went out of his way to not invite you. How am I gonna feel if I show up with an uninvited, unwelcome intruder?
Absolutely. You're telling me there's no room to move on pasta. All starches are a scam.
(hearing Jerry broke up with Patty) Are you still down in the dumps? Come on. It's just a chick.
Yes! (both laugh) God, I've never felt so alive!
Yeah, me either.
Don't you see how wrong that is?! Where's your Christmas spirit? And eye for an eye!
Nah, I have asthma. (Robin's kid grabs George's leg from under the table, and George struggles.)
(considers, but got into elevator) Won't work.
Nothing really, you know...just eh, stroll around the cell blocks, maybe eh, take in a shower fight. (chuckles.) Hey eh, you know you got a bounced check hanging up in the little market over on Columbus?
I think I was affected by the caffeine.
Excuse me, did you say 'Raymond'?
Hey, let's turn off the lights, get some real 'movie atmosphere.'
Das kaffes un salat e grand por favor.
All right we got the wine. Aren't we lucky? We got wine. Whoopee Whoa! Imagine if we didn't bring the wine. We'd be shunned by society. Outcasts! WHERE'S YOUR WINE? GET OUT!
Every woman on the face of the earth has complete control of my life. And yet, I want them all.. is that irony?
Who are you to decide?
Well you see he slipped, and he landed on a kinda of a..
C'mon Jerry, please! It won't happen again.
I just remembered, I gotta be someplace. Yuh-hu-hur, that's enough. Pop. Pop, put down the wrench, Pop.
First class doesn't make it anymore. Now you get on the phone with Kimbrough, tell him what happened and tell him to get another plane down here, but this time, the good one - the Ted Danson plane.
Really?
Definitely.
She's working late that night. We're - were supposed to have dinner with everybody at eight o'clock so I'll set up the ride for seven o'clock.
What? What did you do?
Whadday'mean.?
Oh, gotta get fifty. Gotta get fifty. All right, I tell you what. We go to the coffee shop, you call your manager. Maybe they made an offer.
Nah, I'm good.
What are you worried about, you know it.
You wanted to see me, Mr. Steinbrenner?
I wont mope.
Well Elaine was supposed to help me.
Those nachos are killing me.
Okay, I mean it's serious but--
Yes!
Is he a clown? What, are you kidding me!?
I got it from the Institute. The Institute.
Very nice Tom, that was terrific.
So this Anna called me from out of the blue.
(spins his chair back to face her) So you got a $25,000 a year raise.
Kramer, what's the name of the store with the mannequin?
My little man's an idiot.
You wha?
What TV Guide?
You know what? I changed my mind. I, uh, I don't think so.
What do you tip a chamber maid.
Oh, my god that's Saddam Hussein. The dictator.
A scar?
Hey (sees the coffee stain) Art Garfunkel?
No!
Well, it's just a game. Remember that, kids.
Yeah, he did.
Well, it doesn't even have to be the general manager. Maybe I could be like, an announcer. Like a color man. You know how I always make those interesting comments during the game.
(scream) Jerry!!
Oh no, I can't do it. I-I'm not good at these things, I get flustered. Once I tried to bribe an usher at the roller derby, I almost got arrested.
(Yelling from the bathroom) Don't tell her anything, she'll kill me!!
Oh I missed the Maestro?
Its your decision.
You think?
A guy?
(feigning excitement) Great, great. O-Oh, oh, oh, gosh. You know, it's just... my duties with the Yankees...
Who paid?
Yeah, she's very lovely.
I don't know, maybe a safe fell on her head.
Uh, good. You know, you might wanna try eating it with one of these. (Holds up lobster bib)
What, to see the old guy?
(pointedly) She could do a lot worse than Mr Peanut, my friend.
Shut up?
No, no,
Yeah, I do that too. I feel guilty about getting the pleasure. I feel like I don't deserve it so I talk. It stops me from enjoying it. There's nothing to eat in here.
You'll do it?
Holly.
Nice to meet you.
No come on, let me, let me. I smashed your car, it cost you over two thousand dollars,
Nooooooo......
Do you swear?
Y'know the average life span for an American male is like, 72. You're really... kinda pushin' the envelope there.
Well, here we are.
Well um, what about tomorrow night?
Oh, she didn't think it was funny. What is she, Rowan & Martin? We're supposed to meet with NBC tomorrow! She completely shattered my confidence. And I'm paying for this, she's my employee!
What about you and Elaine?
Yeah, (Smiling) Susan said you'd be excited.
Youre doomed. Youre gonna have to have all your sex at womens apartments. Itll be like a permanent road trip. Forget about the home bed advantage.
Yeah.
(cocky laughter) Huh haha! (shouts) You're meat, Reilly! You just screwed yourself! (laughter) Ha ha!
The song?
Didn't they notice it?
What, you didn't wash all day?
Get outta here..
Yes, I agree. I hope my parents go long before I do.
Oh, share.
You are gonna love this car. Even if you don't like Jon Voight.
Wow, he really does a number on you. (reads) "Seinfeld froze like a deer in the headlights in the face of incessant heckling."
I'm telling you, that cashier is riding horses on my money.
He mentioned my name?! What did he say?!
See? This looks right to you, doesn't it?
Well you know what I've discovered Mrs. Sokol. It's not so much the looking as the listening. I listen for work. And as I'm looking and listening I am also looking. You can't discount looking. It's sort of a combination. It's looking, and listening, listening and looking. But you must look.
What's the difference? The money is not important.
Well, maybe she decided to celebrate her birthday on the Monday after the weekend.
That's right. He just happened to be the previous owner of the vehicle.
I'm wearing some cologne, all right?
A signal, right, um, okay, uh, okay, the signal is, Ill call out tippy-toe!
Jerry! Jerry! Je Jerry Jerry . The most unbelievable thing has just happened, it's too Unbelievable! I'm sitting in the coffee shop, i'm talking to Susan, were talking about shoe laces (does two guns to the head) so in walks..in walks David, right, he walks right to the table..righ I introduced him to Susan..and he says get this (laughs) he says 'boy you could do a lot better than this guy' huh right (more laughing by George, Jerry is totally just mellow and straight faced) The exact same thing that I said to him, just to get back at me just to get back at me..and then, and then she says she wants to be alone for awhile..Alone Jerry! I think that she thinks that she could do better (laughs) Do you appreciate this? Do you see the irony of this? Do you see what is going on here? What's the matter?
Well I think it would be nice if there was some kind of historical record of it.
(hopeful) Everything?
"....I like spicy chicken"
Your girlfriend is doin' your laundry?
Twenty-five percent? It was your idea.
Oh, the big race.
I don't want him to!
Hehehehehe (higher tone laugh, though still quietly )
No. We're supposed to tell him tonight.
That's my whole afternoon! I was going to look for sneakers.
(acting disappointed) Oh, please don't.
Anyway, I was thinking about what you said. About uh, me and Marisa.
Why not?
What? Oh I spilled some food on it.
Why not? Why not?
You know, I can't remember the last time I called a woman without being nervous. I, usually, I'm pacing all over the room, I'm...
C-Communist? I am a Yankee, sir, first and foremost.
Keith, Keith Wa What happened? Where's Keith?
Why not?!
Hi Beth (Scene Ends then re-begins with Beth and George on Beth's couch) Um anyway Jerry told me that uh.. it might have been my comment in the Coffee Shop that broke you up.
There's a hundred different things here. What's the difference between these two? (They each grab a box and check the ingredients) You got propylparabin?
I hate asking for change. They always make a face. Like I'm asking them to donate a kidney.
(To Jerry) Let me ask you something.. How much do you think it would cost to have tonsils and adenoids removed in the hospital?
So you really understand my point about building a rocket and double-parking.
To ask her out.
When did you leave the message?
Yeah, I wish.
(after waitress walks away) I don't believe it, she did it again!
Mrs. Seinfeld?!?
Because, Jerry, it's a couple rule! We have to tell each other everything!
Okay, look, Audrey, before you take the bandage off just remember that I was the one that encouraged you to do this, you know? Now that you're gonna be a great beauty, let's not forget how this all began. You know, like if you'd listened to your friend, Elaine,
Alright, maybe four.
(Stern, angered) I hope so. (Takes the scissors)
(feeling awkward) Its uh, not bad, its comin along. Why? Did you need something.
(Eating) Oh yeah. These are fantastic, fantastic. (To server) You know, I'd love to get a jump on the next batch, where do you come out? (Server leaves) (To Anna) She's been ignoring this section all night. Quesadilla?
What did you have?
(pleased with himself) You are having problems with your boyfriend and I am meeting you to discuss the situation.
(to salesman) Well, maybe you could show me something else.
Well, it always has to be explained to me, and then I have to have someone explain the explanation.
What?
Well ...... but how do I get someone else fired?
So.....She's dead?
And then assuming the strike is resolved, on April 14th, we, ah, play the Angels. So lets clear a floor at the Anaheim Hotel.
A tractor.
(on intercom) It's George.
"BECAUSE IF HE CAN'T JUMP. THERE GOES MY SNEAKER BUSINESS!!"
(Muttering) Susan has the doll collection.. one of the dolls looks exactly like my mother.. she likes to sleep with it.
I dunno, I'm in a limo. (dials) Hello ma? It's me. Guess where I am. In the back of a limo. No, nobody died. It's a long story, I can't tell you now. Because I can't. I said I can't. If I could, I would. Would you stop it? Alright, look, I'm getting off. No, I'm not telling you! How's this? I'm *never* telling you! I don't care! No! Fine! Never!!
Whew! Anybody see that poster in there? That is weird, wild stuff, huh? Whew!
Chaperone? What, are you kidding?
(humble) Well, if you must know, shhhe, was my fiance, Susan. May she rest in peace.
Sorry, Mr Wilhelm.
No!
What? Too short?
What? Huh, so I had it all along. How d'you like that? (snorts) I guess I owe that cashier an apology.
Well, well, well.
(banging the recorder) Stop it! Stop it!
It's George.
(Panicky) Uh, yeah. You know, Doctor, I gotta tell you, I feel a lot better.
For my hamstring.
Yeah!, a doodle of me...look at the size of the nose , the ears, all my features are distorted.
Eh, they're trying to pick out a new couch - you don't want to know. (Remembering the watching Van Buren Boys) Give me your wallet, or I'll spill your guts right here on the street!
No. Autonomy, complete and total autonomy.
It's not that I want to keep talking about it? just think that the subject should resolve itself based on its own momentum.
I thought Mulva hated you.
And you know what else I've decided to do? I'm going to keep seeing the bald woman.
Wh.. Where you going?
Right now? "Jerry"?
What's gonna happen? They can't kill us.
That's what I'm saying.
Would you like a chair?
Napkins?
What about these?
Were really glad for you.
(talking to nobody) I like horses. Maybe I could be a stable boy.
No, no...
Mr. Pensky? Of the Pensky file?
good thing I asked
Exactly.
Because I uh, I told her the truth.
Hi, Carol.
Are you sure?
I left it at Heather's. Are these alive? (pounding on glass display)
Fine, I'll make an appointment. (He leaves)
What?
Well, anything I can do to help, um...she's a wonderful girl. Very smart. Very eh...crafty.
Smoking.
Wait wait wait, what is she... (takes the milk can from Jerry and puts it on the table) What is she like?
What are we gonna tell Jerry about the car?
I'm the one he wants! He's coming to settle the score.
Well, that's.. Elaine!
I have a fear of intimacy
These fries are really really good...
Hey! Wow, the K-Man! (They walk into the kitchen inside)
You think she liked me? She seemed to like me.
Yes of course go ahead. My guess is you're going to like this very much.
Hey, shut up.
Sure. I could go the tomato route. But eh, I've given this a lot of thought Jerry. All that frustration. Ill never get any work done. So Im doing a complete 360. Im going for total efficiency and ability.
"Ha..harrr."
Yes! Nothing says George like a movie!
How can you call yourself a clown and not know who Bozo is?
No, no I don't think so.
20 bucks? Isn't that excessive?
(wiping the area with a hand) People think they're so important...
Really?
And then in the fifth inning, why did you take off on the pop fly?
I'm feeling something else here, Jerry!
We could be zipping all over the place.
You've never seen this before?
945
You sure?
Told me what?
I don't know, I just can't. Nobody in my family can pay for parking, it's a sickness. My father never paid for parking; my mother, my brother, nobody. We can't do it.
All right You really want to know?...It all started when she told met hat...she was the voice on your tape recorder.
'Cause I shaved yesterday in the afternoon.
This country needs more people like you!
(distracted) Mm? (acknowledges Katy) Oh, hi. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. We met uh, skiing that time. You're uh, married to the eye guy.
I really think it looks good.
What are you guys doing?
Oh yeeah.. well , Big smoker... I (coughs some more) gave it up for a while but it was too tough. Y' know.....I got no will power.
Come on, wanna give me a hand with the computers?
No good?
A plane crash? A Heart attack? Lupus? Is it Lupus?
Something like that.
Here. Let me take your tabe downstairs for you.
You're kidding.
That's a very good question. You know she and I go out for dinner, she doesn't even reach for the check. That?s all I?m asking for is a reach. Is that so much to ask for?
Na no, I'm not good in these situations. I can't hide my pity. I..I make em feel worse.
So she coughed.
Yes. Me, too. I wanna be normal. Normal.
Here we go.
(holding a magazine cover) Mira Sorvino. Think she'd go out with me?
Yeah.
Ahh, money.
This is what I'm talking about.
No, that's not it at all.
(To himself) How am I gonna do this? I'm engaged to this woman? She doesn't even like me. Change the subject? Toilets were the subject. We don't even share the same interests.
What are you repeating everything I'm saying?
Hey, did you see that whale thing on TV last night?
I, uh, oh, broke a shoelace today.
Very nice
You can't do that, you can't just sneak in from the back like that.
Cleaning
Italian.
No. She tried to give me the "it's not you, it's me" routine.
I told her I would have to think about it.
Is that good?
(On his way out) Heh, heh, heh. Thats what they want you to think.
Oh, you haven't heard, she's going to live with her grandparents in Redding Pennsylvania.
Huh. What, the whole apartment?
No, it's nothing bad. I'm getting married.
All right I gotta get going.
Oh you told her didn't you.
I'd get tired of it.
(To himself) So you're havin' the sex, next day you don't have to call. That's pretty good. (Back to Jerry) Go ahead.
Oh... do I have to write him a note or something?
Uncle Leo's having regular sex?
We talked about his new batting stance, you know, I'm not crazy about it, but I said , 'Donny, go with it 'till it stops workin'.' Donny baseball. He's a helluva guy.
I think. (Pause as they all look down)
Well, I might be getting into that.
We've just been through this! You don't remember? We just had this exact same conversation a minute ago!
Yeah. I'll pay for it.
I'm, you know, engaged.
Well whad you buy it for?
Couldnt be better.
That's David Letterman. I just saw David Letterman walk by. I'll be right back. (He exits)
To the hospital.
I want you to have this job. Of course...
That's okay. That's good. You think Louie Pasteur and his wife had anything in common? He was in the fields all day with the cows, you know with the milk, examining the milk, delving into milk, consummed with milk. Pasteurization, Homogenization, She was in the kitchen killing cockroaches with a boot on each hand.
Wait, wait. Here me out. Don't dismiss this. You're very quick to dismiss. Don't dismiss. She's got a big crush on David Letterman, I mean, a big crush. She talks about him all the time. Suppose I go up to David Letterman. He works at NBC; I work at NBC. I explain my situation. He agrees to meet her. They go out, they fall madly in love. And she dumps me for David Letterman.
(Unsure) I don't a..
God, I'm starved, I'm weak from hunger.
How come?
Yes, I am.
Yeah for two hours. She's nuts about you.
me too, I am down, I am totally down, mark me down
Yeah, yeah.
Well, it's the damnedest thing. The cat dies. So she comes back into town, she finds the cat lying on the carpet stiff as a board.
I got a source.
(angry, to himself) The ocean called. Running outta shrimp. Outta shrimp! (a thought occurs) Oh! Yes! That's what I shoulda said! (frustrated shout) Dammit!
I don't think we should see each other anymore. You're great but I'm I'm riddled with personal problems.
Oh, it's gotta be fifty! Hee hee! You know how much Ted Danson makes, huh?
Yeah my parents have it. Sometimes it skips a generation.
As you care for me. Which is why it is very important that you never breathe a word of this to anyone about the... you know. What, with Clarence Thomas and everything.
What?
What if he's waiting for me outside? He pointed at me! Did you see him point?!
Is that common in our family?
I never should have brought her up there. Should have known better. Should have seen it coming. I didn't see it coming.
Sure. (Turns around.)
I could see that...
Why did you refuse the package. Everybody loves a package.
What? I don't see anything.
Oh hey, by the way. Do you want a box 'a, Cuban cigars? I smoked one last night. I got nauseous.
Thank you very much. (Walks out)
Yes.
(quietly) That's uh, for the two of us.
Well, a lot of people keep popcorn in the house.
Who?
How gee what a coincidence.
I don't know. Perhaps I can better serve the world this way.
Huh, nggh [snort] Stop. (flirting with her he playfully hits her arm with the menu, then flicks it into the air)
I thought you said one oclock.
Nothing It's not you. It's me. I have a fear of commitment. I don't know how to love.
But...somebody like Gail, though.
(Nervous) What are you talking about?
It's a broad noodle.
I didnt know there was a fireplace. A fireplace, that's incredible.
Nothing. I don't know...just a little dirt.
Can I finish?
Hey Elaine.
Hey, Tim.
Oh! my God!!......You?.....You?...That was you?....
You're a very handsome man, by the way.
But you didn't use a coaster, Jerry, you left a stain! (he runs to kitchen)
All right, believe me, you're not going to marry him.
Oh good, good, come in. Come in, welcome. I'm George. And this is Jerry, over there, on the phone, that's Jerry. And you are, um?
But I was thinking...T-bone.
All you got is instant coffee? Why don't you get some real coffee?
No, its not a problem, I can get rid of the apartment this afternoon.
Hey, you know what else is playing here? ``Rochelle Rochelle''.
(at dinner with his cousin) Some more merlot?
Well, I don't really like her.
Well, I'm still here. You took out the other guy!
Hey, he,
No.
Can't we discuss this?
Ho, ho, ho, good dog, good dog...
I dont know, what? Eight thousand. Its a Hyundai. Get out of here. I told you not to sell. Simons made money, Wilkinson cleaned up.
Yeah.
I guess... (chuckles) today shes late.
Oh, deserve! I don't know if I deserve...I mean...
Damn you, laser guy! You had to grab it all with your lowbrow laser shtick! You're just a prop comic! Where's the craft?!
You're gonna rip it. You're gonna rip it.
No.
But enough about fish, huhuhu. I can discuss other things you know, ah architecture. Huhu. (makes a wide gesture with his arms)
Yeah I guess. What can I do? I gotta take her with me. Todd introduced us, I'm obligated.
Assistant to the General Manager!! Do you know what means?!? He'd could be askin' my advice on trades! Trades, Jerry, I'm a heartbeat away!
And the Christian rock?
This is a brand new jacket. Boy this really burns me up, ...
Ooooh, yes they do.
Oh no, Mr.Steinbrenner, I can explain...
Oh. (Goes back into the bathroom.)
I couldn't help it! Elaine moved the mirror, I got discombobulated.
(sniffing) Hmm. Game hen?
You know it's a public phone, you're not supposed to just chit-chat.
Right.
Supposed to close with the swirl?
I'll tell ya, if I had one of these things, I'd be eatin' hot dogs all the time.
I tell you what, you give me the twenty, and I will buy *you* a popcorn and soda, and I'll throw in a bon-bons.
Excuse me, uh I couldn't help but notice that you were looking in my direction.
(entering) Last night, huh? Was that something, or was that something?
(embarrassed with a touch of unrestrained jubilation) Yes.
(Studying the salt shaker) I'm not taking a civil service test.
[furious] Good. It's good to be accurate like that.
What, you don't want me to hold your keys?
It's not him!
What's the deal with Aquaman? Could he go on land, or was he just restricted to water?
This is incredible!
(shout) Marisa Tomei!
(high-fiving) Hey!
I believe the doors on the bathroom stalls, here at the stadium, don't offer much by way of privacy. But I was thinking if we extend the doors all the way to the floors......
Yeah.
I think I can still catch her.
Hey! Uh--listen--did you get your--uh--boss's Knick ticket, for Kramer?
What, you think I'm going to repeat the whole thing now?
(Definite) Oh yeah.
This good be so sweet, Jerry. Saving lives? She's one step away working at the clinique counter!
Really?
The guy who pitched him the show with the stories about nothing. (snaps fingers) Jerry Seinfeld. Jerry Seinfeld's friend.
Oh, no no no. Course not. I got a great name for our kids. A real original. You wanna hear what it is? Huh, you ready?
(Laughs) yeah, burned. Whoo..
.........What's that?...
You're not out there! You can't be, because *I* am out there. And if I see *you* out there, there's not enough voltage in this world to electroshock me back into coherence!
(Uncapping his pen) Alright, here we go.
You stole the bread?
Well I am actually going to have a secretary and I get to do the interview.
Hello everybody.
Never thought I'd fail at failing.
What? Really?
Oh ya, This is my fiance, Susan. This is David
I slipped on the invitations...how's the towels?
Actually, I did have a thought.
It's about nothing.
Yeah. No, no, no, wait a minute, I always have tuna on toast. Nothing's ever worked out for me with tuna on toast. I want the complete opposite of on toast. Chicken salad, on rye, un-toasted with a side of potato salad ... and a cup of tea. (laughs)
(angry undertone) Oh, I'm gonna give you a Royal bearing. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Lemme get a pack of gum here.
Uh, nothing. I got to go.
(confused, to himself) Like me? But how?
(surprised) So, I'm Neil? How did I do that?
Well, how did she react?
What's with all these people having babies?
Ok, thanks.
(adamant) Ah, c'mon! I'm telling you, I can coach for the NFL. It's not that hard
Hi.
Still a little summer left.
The better looking they are, the faster they go! I mean, I see they out there on the street, they're zooming around, like a blur. Like they have a motor on their ass.
A counter-clockwise swirl.
You know what I never understood? Why did they change the siren noise? When I was a kid it was always "waaaa, waaaa", you know now it "woo-woo-woo-woo-woo". Why did they do that, did they do some research? Did they find that woo-woo was more effective than waa?
Payroll!!
I know!
Oh. The summer me.
He never finished the sentence. He got a call, that was the end of the interview.
What's he yelling about? They're stealing jackets here!
Who said that?
Yeah!
(dread) Oh god.
One little wink. She'll freak out, tell my parents. They'll be all over me. Who is this guy?
You are a good friend. You know what? Even if you killed somebody I wouldn't turn you in.
What about the body, what kind of body?
Hey, at least I was a camp waiter.
(through a mouthful of shrimp) Well, why don't we just put a monitor in his skybox?
Cracks? What were they saying?
Uh, it was dangling! There were only two left in the machine! He mustve bought one, and gotten both.
(to Claire) Now, a woman calls me, all right?
Well, I have to see her.
[pause] Would I like to come up? I would love to come up. I, I'm fighting not to. Fighting! Unfortunately I uh have to get an early start tomorrow. Gotta' get up and hit that pavement
oh..
Check that out (showing newspaper)
I know, I know, I can't stop it!
No, I-I-I know... [retreats back to his Chinese take out] I know...
Wha-Is that the one your parents gave you?
Geez, Hey you know something, you should try my friend's wake up service. She swears by this thing.
Yeah, go ahead, call.
I'm gay! I'm a gay man! I'm very, very gay.
Well I just got back from swimming in the pool. And the water was cold...
(explaining, with lots of hand gestures) Okay, look. We've never worked together on a lie. Now, you don't understand how I work. I have a certain way of working. Jerry and I have worked together a few times. He knows how I work. It's not a personal thing, y'know? We're just trying to come up with the best possible lie. That's what this is all about.
Oh uuh, sure, why not. (the blind man hangs on to George's arm) Hey, that's the guy.
I want to know how did that get into my car?
(on the phone) Uh, Mrs. Ross? It's-it's George.
George.
That's a great idea!!!
Nice to meet you.
You know, it's not the S.A.T.s!
You owe me ten dollars.
So we're not going?
This is a *great* idea! Here... use this one. I get frequent flyer miles with every purchase... Wait! Get two tickets. As long as your turning it in for a refund what's the difference? I'll get *double* the bonus miles.
I'll drive.
And you met her in an antique store! I don't know how you do it!
May I help you?
Well, I like a rolling writer. They're very smooth.
I'm losin' it!
(Sarcastic) Maybe for her new performance piece she'll give birth on stage.
All right! Come on! Let's not fight.
You see, It's right here. It's all white...
There's elevators all over! It all looks the same.
Well, they get very hot in the polyester. You know, it's not a natural fibre. I think they would prefer cotton.
Right!
(Entering Jerry's apartment with a cartload of computers) Jerry, I've found a way to beat Lloyd Braun! I buy the computers myself, I store 'em in your apartment. Then, after I win the contest, I bring 'em all back and get my money back. Ha ha! It's brilliant. What? What's wrong with your leg?
I think he was trying to tell me something, like it had some sort of a meaning.
Same thing. My god, I'm getting married in December, do you know that?
Oh, well, he was probably just getting anxious to start his vacation.
What?
What happened to the raisins?
Alright, alright!
Yes.
Yeah...
Say you go to the bathroom at two o'clock in the morning, what's the outfit? I mean, you dressing up or is it come as you are?
Bye-bye.
Okay, uh, look, if you want to just keep on doing the same old thing, then maybe this idea is not for you. I, for one, am not going to compromise my artistic integrity. And I'll tell you something else, this is the show and we're not going to change it. (To Jerry) Right?
Sure, Guatamala...
Alright, let's go.
(grunting) Hey! Hey, wait a second. I got an idea.
My place? NO, no, no. I hate my place. I don't wanna go back to my place.
Yes. And listen to this, listen to this; her uncle works for the Yankees and he's gonna get me a job interview. A front office kind of thing. Assistant to the traveling secretary. A job with the New York Yankees! This has been the dream of my life ever since I was a child, and it's all happening because I'm completely ignoring every urge towards common sense and good judgment I have had. This is no longer just some crazy notion. Elaine, Jerry, this is my religion.
Got it. (the waitress walks away) Did you just see what happened here?
Oh yeah.. (Starts to open it) Sally called Susan - said you guys really hit it off.
No! I am not going to see a psychiatrist!
Why? Why? 'Cause he's off his rocker! That's why.
Dogs, twists, a kind of fermented chicken drink.
You don't believe me? Ask Jerry.
My cars a little crumpled?!?
I know, sir. It won't happen again.
(bewildered) Heh heh.
..And I went down there one time to see...
What, what happened to you?
Hi, we're from the United Volunteers, we've come to pick up the TV.
No. It didn't take.
(tearing out cheque) Yeah, same time. (hands over cheque) There you go.
Sure.
(considers for a second) I dont care.
Who goes to the Super Bowl with their mailman?!
They *left* the Junior Mint *in* him?
He's a great writer.
(Hangs up phone and pauses) this is great! He fired her! This is incredible, he fired her. I'm out, baby! I'm out!
... Those spastic shnitzer twins ...
Really? What does it mean?
I had a job interview.
Yeah. Hey, you know, I gotta go get these tomatoes. You wanna go for a ride?
No, no, no. Nothing happens.
Where do you come up with this stuff?
I have noticed she does tend to go to the bathroom right after we finish eating.
You told David Putty your move and you didn't tell *me*? I *need* a move. You know I have no moves, Jerry. (points to the candy bar) Gimme a bite.
Hey, whats goin on?
That's it?
That?s-that?s-Harry Fong, he's a very good friend of mine and he's a big opera buff. Enjoy the show there harry!... You know what.
And, Ill have a club soda with no ice.
Payroll project. Wilhelm? Big uh, big payroll project.
(adamant) Yes I am. I defy you to come up with a better name than Seven.
Excuse me. Am I talking to you, Pinhead? Am I?!
Yeah. Right.
Depends on what?
Does Neil like to eat a big breakfast?
No.
If we could just harness this power and use it for our own personal gain, there'd be no stopping us.
Sure you can.
I can't.
That's true.
So it was my comment that broke them up?
Jerry! (Slams the door) Georgie's moving out!
How could you do that?
So ... uh, squirrel.
Lemme see this. (Tries to grab the papers.)
Oh, uh, "The Falconer" by John Cheever. It's really excellent.
You know, it was really wrong of you to back out on that deal.
I thought Kramer was watching.
Oh, nothin' much. I went over to jerry's, uh, talked to Jerry.
No, you're gonna sit down, you son of a gun...
It's a blue Honda...
How 'ya feelin'?
Wow. Uh, what do I have to do?
All right (he smiles weakly at Maura)
Me??
Fragile Frankie Merman? I never liked that guy.
What time is it?
Right, gotta get going.
Do you believe this? We're fighting. We're fighting.
The wedding is off. Now you can go to the Super Bowl.
So I finally stop and say, "Tatiana, I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but I think it would be best if I left".
The guy playing Kramer threatened me.
Could there be a native p0roblem in the Caymans? Maybe theres native unrest.
Oh my god.
Is there a pinkish hue?
Seemingly. Seemingly, to the untrained eye, I can fully understand how you got that impression. What looked like pushing...what looked like knocking down...was a safety precaution! In a fire, you stay close to the ground, am I right? And when I ran out that door, I was not leaving anyone behind! Oh, quite the contrary! I risked my life making sure that exit was clear. Any other questions?
Oh, yeah. Still in good with the ground crew. (Laghs)
Well, I just had a fight - I need a group dynamic.
(interrupting) Elaine. Shut up.
Oh, well, so what? Laughter - what is that? I mean, what is the point of opening your mouth and going "Ha, ha!"? What is that? "Ha, ha!"?
Why couldn't you squeeze one of those stupid rubber balls to get your stress out? Why did you have to destroy *twenty-five* computers?
Oh ya, like there's something wrong with saying 'God bless you'. I was raised to say 'God bless you'.
Jerry, I'm gonna kill you!
All day. ( phone rings , Jerry picks up)
So, you were saying how, um...about the script...
Your clothes smell just like Pisano's. There's another Italian place on Jerome. Maybe I can fool him.
I'm cheap? You think I'm CHEAP? How could you say that to me? I can't believe this. How could you say that to me?
Next to each other?
Celia broke out of prison. I'm sitting in my home, she shows up at the door!
Why him? Why not me?
Ha! Heh.
(Still mad a Leslie) Never said goodbye. Goodbye!
This prison stinks.
I said 'God bless you'. Was that so wrong?
Well, they're obviously not here.
Hey. It's me.
I saw them making out, you can believe it.
Hey Elaine, does Tony like peanut butter?
Me? It wasn't me I never even saw the ball. All you do is dribble.
(grabbing lapels) J. Crew.
(Laughs slightly) A physician married to a salesman. (Chuckles) Well, I gotta tell you, Beth, you coulda done a lot better than him.
(chuckling to himself) Housewarming gift. (swerving the car to go to the antique stand) All right, we're taking it up a notch!
Well, you know, if I uh, wasn't engaged.
(Staring at the doll) This doll (Pointing) looks like my mother.
Pardon?
She'll open!
(rage) Oh, it's got cachet, baby! It's got cachet up the yin-yang!
Would you stop that? It's not safe to be jumping up and down on a plane.
(Standing up) Yes. This is wrong!
Is there ever a good time to have your parents stay with you?
I thought you were meeting Kennedy.
My Job..arghhh
It's Juu-uu-une! Hey hay. Yes.
We do?
Photo store Sheila.
I'm wearin' a little hat, I'm jumpin' through fire.. They're puttin' their little alien heads in my mouth..
Yeah.
So?
The rule is a minimum of two days.
Of course. We all do.
Cause its signals, Jerry, its signals! (snapping his fingers) Dont you- all right. Did she even ask you, what you were doin tomorrow night, if you were busy?
Alright. Uh, well, I'm out of here. (Gets up to leave)
(to the saleswoman) You know honey for an unadvertised sale, you're doing a lot of yapping about it.
Thank you.
I feel fat.
Oh, the busboy left the menu a little close to the candle.
Kramer, I really owe you one.
Now I remember, as I jumped over the hole I heard a, like a jingling sound.
Cinnamon? Why didn't cha get chocolate?
Wait, wait a minute...they don't have them anymore. I just found out, they just took them off the market.
(Stingy) Its wrinkled. Its worthless.
Thank you very much. You just stand over there, I?ll stand over here.
"Plyometric?"
(moody) Great! Now she's sour!
Why not? Pay is good. I got dental, private access to one of the great handicapped toilets in the city.
I didn't get any bread.
(downcast) Yeah, too bad. Too bad.
(Takes a few seconds to mull this one over. Shooting Jerry a confused look, he repeats it) "The panties your mother laid out for you"? (Jerry nods) What does that mean?
Well, you know, book reports. That kind of stuff.
I will never understand the bathrooms in this country. Why is it that the doors on the stalls do not come all the way down to the floor?
Oh please.
I mean it's gotten to the point where I'm flirting with operators on the phone. I almost made a date with one.
Conveyor belt.
Revenge.
It's good, right?
Hey that's swell.
Please, it doesnt look good. Boy, boy, girl.
Might be easier.
People break up all the time.
Again with the Rava.
Ahoy! Mr. Eldridge. I understand you were on the Andrea Doria.
I don't want to hear it, Kramer!
Whoa, look at this. This is a beautiful suit. Huh?
Hey, where you just at the health club?
You mean just walk into the staff meeting on Monday morning like it never happened?
I go in to use his private bathroom, everybody uses it, and then I get a memo - a memo - telling me to use the men's room in the hall. Well, (laughing) I mean we share it with Pace Electronics. It's disgusting!
The next morning, I woke up, and it was going like this. (moves his arm slowly) I can control it if I really concentrate. But otherwise, (arm moves) oh.
I'm not* sure.
Really? Why?
(Fed up with his parents) Actually, I think I'm pretty clear on it.
I'll fight ya! Not the face! Not the face! (The struggle continues.)
Would you take her out?
I can't tell ya now , he's gonna be back in a ten seconds.
(Smiling) Nothing.
Yes, full. I love to be full ... love to sit back, loosen the old belt and digest away for hours. Let those enzymes do their work.
Huh. You must think Im pretty stupid. (The mechanic shoots him a look as if he cleary does think hes stupid) That was no 5th Avenue bar. I can see the crumb right there in the corner of your lip! Now, that-that-that is a cookie - and we all know that Twix is the only candy bar with the cookie crunch.
She's bluffing...
You really think so?
It's not working, Jerry. It's just not working. (sits down next to Elaine)
I am. Im a nice guy. And she seduced me! We were in my apartment, Im sitting on the couch, shes on the chair. I get up to go to the bathroom, I come back, shes on the couch. What am I supposed to do? Not do anything? I couldnt do that. I wouldve insulted her.
Officer, he can't pull in head first.
You couldn't figure out the World's Theory for yourself? It's just common sense. Anybody knows, ya gotta keep your worlds apart. (gesturing with hands going outward)
(pointing out the positive) But happy.
Play Now thinks I got problems in both legs. My own personal Rascal, Jerry. On the house.
See, I knew it. I knew this was gonna happen...
Why don't we get them a couch? (Kramer laughs) Well rent a U-haul -- well bring em a nice sectional.
Where are we going? Why are we pulling off here?
Always.
I can't sell the book. It's been marked.
Well, what's the reason?
Yup.
They had a pastry cart you wouldn't believe.
I told you, I told you! Ha ha ha! Ooh ooh!
Hey, yeah. My parents want to come too, is that ok?
Hmm-hmm, not by a long shot. I'm calling up the Rosses and inviting them up to my non-existent place in the Hamptons. Then we'll see who blinks first.
You mean in the end?
No, no. I'm not going on.
Jerry, come on. If my mother keeps shrinking, this is exactly what she's gonna look like in ten years!
Oh, Schumann. Of course.
Uh, excuse me, uh, um, Jason. I don't want to get into a big thing here, but... I'm not sure if, technically, what you just said was actually an apology.
I'm all for awkward pauses. Fix me up with her.. Wait a minute, Nina just saw me in my Timberlands! Now I have to wear them every time I see her.
Yes I look forward to many years of... looking at the triangles. Well, I'll ah, I'll wait for you outside.
Can I say one word to you? Lobster. The lobster here is unbelievable. (looks at the menu) Ooh, a little expensive.
Ah, you still going on in front of Bania, eh?
(coming back to the table from the bathroom) Oh uh. You ready?
Alright. (Holds them up)
Well, I'm satisfied. Uh...my back is...killing me.
Because great couples always have a great story about how they met. That's why I've never been in a long term relationship. I've never had a good meeting story.
If I do it, will you buy a computer?
Oh I would love that. You think he'd really do it?
Newman!!
Trapezoid?
No, Im saying, if a situation arose in which you didnt want it, I might take it.
What? Every time I leave my house now I have to call everybody I know and ask them if they want to do what I'm doing?
Huh. Your renting a house in Tuscany?
Thank you Mr.Farkus, thank you very much indeed sir.
Well, actually you did miss one nugget of entertainment. (Pause) Have you ever seen Elaine dance?
Sorry, you don't know what's going on out there! (looks at Owen) Who's he?
"George likes spicy chicken."
She said no.
...thirty-two, thirty-three-
Yes, please.
(Gesturing to Jerry) Check the raiser.
Yada.
Of course hes been in touch with him. Hes left two messages. He just hasnt heard back yet, thats all.
Why is the mailman wearing a bucket?
I'm the consolation guy...?
Yeah. yeah. I-I know.
I'll fake an illness. (Acts it out) My back! My back! I can't believe, my back.
I mean I'm the one who bought it.
Hate the Drake.
(Still on the showers) Can I use hot water on my face?
So?
No, not that I know of. (winks)
Hey, it's George.
Oh, of course. (motioning Estelle to enter) Of course.
yeah, Kramer, we're, uh, kind of in the middle of something here. We're trying to do a little work..
They're worse! They're much worse than us, they talk about everything! Couldn't you at least tell her about the shrinkage factor?
Sid, who's gonna move the cars while you're away?
So... here I am. Ready to take you to the Hamptons.
Oh, so now I have to buy this whole chair by myself?
I quit my job.
Whatever.
Can't go, Why not?
You had to move the mirror?
It's not that long, really.
Really? And Debby told me that she fell in love with him because he has all this perspective!
Well then she's just a Liar, Isn't she?
(Turning back to Jerry, he takes the check back. He just now notices the shirt Jerry's wearing, and snickers, pointing) Nice shirt.. (Laughs, Jerry shrugs) What is this? Is this what you wore on the show?
This is nighmare. Kramer how long was I on?
I am different, yeah.
This is amazing. (George gets up to leave and shake's man's hand) Thank you. Thank you very much. . . . I'm going back in! . . . You'll feel better (to woman)
I don't need any ideas. It's a show about nothing.
I must have dripped some on the floor and I slipped and...
No-no-no, Kramer. Kramer! Kramer! You *cannot* abandon people in the middle of an airport pickup! It's a binding social contract. We... we must go forward... not back.
The door? Why would I go out the door? The window's right here.
Bologna?! No one eats bologna anymore!
What is this?
Really? You wanna come?
I don't know, it sounds like pigeons or something!
This is incredible! This is one of the greatest things I've ever done in my life! I'm gonna call my mother.
Is he still nuts?
Yeah, yeah, yeah we could. You know, ah, Kramer, the next time you talk to her, find out if she knows Kelly, from Monk's. I wanna know if she really has a boyfriend.
What's wrong? I'll tell you what's wrong. I just committed adultery!
All right, I?ll tell you what, you seem like a nice guy, let?s stop jerking around. Give me.. two hundred and fifty dollars, I?ve got people waiting for me, I've got to get the hell out of here.
What'd you do today, dad?
Get out?
What?
I was betrayed! That kid was like a son to me. And if there's one person you should be able to hold down, it's your own flesh and blood. Like my father.. my father's father before him.
"...It's the chicken"
(disappointment) Oh. Course not.
What about this leftover Chinese food?
I'm against all "it's me"s. So self-absorbed and egotistical, it's like those hip musicians with their complicated shoes!
...you're very attractive...
I insist. Ill fix us a drink. (phone rings  who would that be?) I got it.
Well the guy's just standing there.
Gotta get the good ones.
(Depressed) Well,.. the Andrea Doria.. that was quite a fire. (Moves to the door, leaving)
I need food, Jerry. I feel faint, I'm getting light headed.
(frustrated) No. No, no, no. You're not helping me.
Aah, yeah, yeah. Won't you head on in, we'll be in in a second. Be right with you.
I got it. You wanna get her something nice? How 'bout a music box?
I'm the bad boy. I've never been the bad boy.
Give me one.
Its amazing. We, we both have dates on the same night. I cant remember the last time that happened.
So how do you want to do this?
You know, Jason, I, uh, I couldn't help notice, I... I didn't get my apology.
I don't have a hi-fi.
So what happened? She throw you out? Eh?
Thanks again for last night!
Mr. Steinbrenner--
Oh, you're in here.
(waving apologetically) Not you.
JERRY! What happened to you?
Hi.
What?! Well, what are you doing here?
(contemptuously, imitating Altons voice) Hes in the bathroom.
He's on the lamb(?), he's on the loose!
Alright, I gotta go home and open up with the house for the carpet cleaners. You know they're doing my whole place for twenty-five dollars.
So did you enjoy your lunch?
Elaine, Elaine, Elaine, Elaine...(distant alarm sound which is getting louder.)
You're kidding? Somebody else got killed?
That's cute.
Only I hold the answer key to their true candy identities. And so, without further ado, I give you the candy line-up. (Opens a door to a back room. Various dealership employees are munching on candy bars)
What are you doing?
The Human Fund.
Do you really think so?
No.
Really?
I just remembered, th-th-there's this Chinese restaurant out near Yankee Stadium, that puts flyers on all the cars.
The Rosses have started up a foundation, Jerry, and I have to sit on the board of directors.
Y'know, I'm better with the mothers than I am with the daughters.
Hello. I'm O'Brien.
So, what do you think?
It was kinda fun. (Elaine gives Jerry a cold cloth for his jaw.) You know, maybe his name really is J-O-H-N, but he changed it to J-O-N for show business. Well, you know, J-O-N is a lot zippier.
(to Mickey) Can't you just switch with another Midget?
Nothing.
Silence YES!!
What happened to you?
I got to go.
Yuh. What about physically?
Lemme see. I can't believe you got these for free. (Looking at the tickets) Row F?!
Just inch over. You worm your way.
I'll call a plumber right now! (Goes for the phone.)
No. This is not cotton. Here, lemme see. (Tries to look at the tag on the uniform. Tartabull gets creeped out and resists.) Will you stop it? (Looks at the tag.) Oh. Of course. Polyester!
(Also, over his shoulder) Not me.
Well, here you go. What do you think?
Don't do it!
And you automatically sleep with her?
*No*...
She didn't help him?
'Mickey'? (incredulous) 'Mickey'!
Helping people... Of course. Of course! It makes perfect sense! How could I *not* be doing this!? I am gonna help somebody, Dammit!
I got to get downtown and buy that suit. The store opens in twenty minutes.
... so glad.
Discovered the Mississippi.
I'll take one. It's possible.
What are you crazy?
Parker, I never said driver, I said parker, a great parker.
Alright, listen, I'll give you your spare keys, but I don't have them with me. Can I please have mine to give to back to Kramer?
What?
How ya doing?
Discovered a cure for baldness.
Tell him to open it.
It just didnt work out. What can I do? I wanted to love her. I tried to love her. I couldnt.
No. Definitely not.
Yeah.
I didn't know she took it!
I don't understand what the big deal is. They let you try on pants.
Dont insult me, my friend. Remember who youre talking to. No ones a bigger idiot than me.
. . .uh, . . . wait a second. Are you suggesting that I went out of my way to tell Elaine that even though you handed her the big salad, that it came from me?
He just walked away! And once again I'm standing here like a little man. Well not this time! (George leaves the store and follows the dog owner) You! Dog man!
Kramer, she's a model.
(Losing it) Funny guy!
Hey hey hey, check me out, huh?
Please, this is very, very important.
Well, you know. You get to a certain point, you wanna know about your roots.
Like that?
Well I can't now, Gwen's going to be there.
Thank you.
Popcorn?
Shut your traps and stop kicking the seats! We're trying to watch the movie! And if I have to tell you again, we're gonna take it outside and I'm gonna show you what it's like! You understand me? Now, shut your mouths or I'll shut 'em for ya, and if you think I'm kidding, just try me. Try me. Because I would love it!
Let me ask you something. Could you tell if teeth marks on someone's arm matched teeth marks on a pencil?
You only think that because you know me.
Well if Houdini couldn't do it, what chance do I have?
Tell you how you could check.
Oh, yeah? Holistic.. that's what I need. That's the answer.
Nope, no can do.
Heard that one already.
Jerry, it's me, George, don't worry, I'll return it tomorrow, no problem.
Well, I wanna put a picture of me and my boss Mr. Morgan up at the office.
Yes. With a little guidance, Steven Koren is going to be everything I claim to be, only for real. That's my dream, Jerry.
Severance package...The Yankees are giving me three months full pay for doing nothing.
(Hands still out, even though they've stopped looking at them) What happened to him?
Its unbelievable. You know what else is unbelievable? I picked up the check. She didnt even offer. She ended it. The least she could do is send me off with a sandwich.
If you don't mind, sir. I'll be here at 8.
That's exactly my point.
So?
Yeah, I told her to call me here and to tell anyone who answers the phone to ask for a balding, stocky man with glasses. I better tell him I'm expecting a call.
(Frantic) Kramer, do you know what those guys are gonna do to me?!
All right, it wouldn't kill me.
I have a point, I have a point.
You find this interesting, don't you?
Of course, right.
Yeah, I better grab some too.
You guys ever shot anybody?
How's this for criticism? Um...you stink. How do like that criticism? You know what's funny to me? That diploma up on the wall. That is my idea of "com-med-dee"! You sitting here, telling people what to do.
We have a, three-o'clock appointments.
Exactly!
Thank you very much. (Peggy leaves the menus and walks away) So guess what I got do tomorrow?
Look, I have my system. First I look for the dream spot right in front of the door, then I slowly expand out in concentric circles.
Yes, yes! The punishment should fit the crime.
An eye job? Ma, you don't need an eye job.
I'm not paying for this. If you were going out with her, it'd be a different story.
She is succinct.
You are ruinin' everything.
Shhh! Listen, you gotta do me a favor. Give me your wallet. I'll give it back to you later.
Oh right, right! The blue sweatpants! Gees, it's too bad you can't say anything because of Angela.
She stole twenty dollars from me. (getting angry) Yeah, I might've gotten it back, but Lloyd Braun interfered!
It's all worked out. Nina and I will have dinner Thursday at the restaurant where Babs works.
We should have left earlier. I told you.
I was moving it across the street, I looked up and I saw Woody Allen and I got all distracted.
Alright! So, she said, that she could've fixed me up with her.
This is by far the most exciting thing I've ever done.
Awright, I'll see you later.
Whatever. (George looks to the table) Hey new tape recorder?
Ah, no, no. Are you sure? A girlfriend?
Oh...pretty good.
No.
Yeah. A couple of people. I don't get that, though. Where do you start?
(Not really wanting to embellish) ..I stopped by the house to drop the car off, and I went inside for a few minutes.. Nobody was there - they're supposed to be working. (Jerry and Elaine look at each other - enjoying the story) My mother had a Glamour magazine, I started leafing through it..
Yeah, sure. (big smile) Then my father will have no place to sleep. (snaps fingers) He's gotta move out.
(sobbing) yodel lay hee hoo..
Really? I never heard of a semi (the "i" sounds like an "e") tractor-trailer. (Jerry nods in agreement)
The woman she's "lesbianing" with? Susan told me she's *never* been with a guy.
You will?
Excuse me, I was waiting here.
Come on now.
Extraordinarily gay. Steeped in gayness.
Ohhhhh.. John-John.
Bozo?
Fine. Steal the battery. Now, all right, here is the Frogger. This is the front door, and this is the outlet.
I should be in a place like this. I envy this woman. Ya' get to wear slippers all day. Friends visit. They pity you. Pity is very underrated. I like it it's good. Plus they give you those word association tests. I love those.
There putting in a lost and found because of me. There's a time limit but still.
No.
Ladies. I, uh, I haven't seen this before.
Of course it's cashemere.
Never mind!
Might meet a celebrity.
Matches? Long matches.
My car's totaled. It's all his fault and now, he has absolutely no money. There is no way that he can pay me. So the judge decrees that he becomes my butler.
Rest... Sest... Hest...
I couldn't take it anymore.
I dont know. Just start scratching. Tell him you have the crabs. He was in the military. Hell understand that.
Kramer, I, I, I, uh, I need to talk to Jerry privately.
Kramer!! Kramer no!!
Because before you know it he'll be having lunch with him. You know how these interoffice politics work.
Who's the Drake?
Huh (quietly)
I know, I know. Kind of a cute Nazi though.
I know less about women than anyone in the world. But one thing I do know is they're not happy if you don't spend the night. It could be a hot, sweaty room with no air conditioning and all they have is a little army cot this wide (Displays with French fry) You're not going anywhere.
(shouting) Fire!!
No, it's not.
I thought he was just gonna have a muffin.
And it's their anniversary Friday night. I could send them for a hansom cab ride. Y -- you think they'd like that?
(to phone) Hi, Allison? Oh, I guess you're not at home.. I probably should 'ave tried you at the office. Anyway, good to hear from ya, really looking forward to the ball.. (hangs up and happily chuckles) Ha ha!
Why not?
Really?
Hi, how are you?
Peter?
I tried! I almost threw it down the incinerator, but I couldn't do it. The guilt was too overwhelming. (Grabs the doll, opening the door to leave) Susan's so attached to this thing.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's in the vault. I'm putting it in the vault.
Whaddya mean, you'll ``get'' the popcorn and the soda?
Hello-o-o-o Elaine!
Mothers say things. My mother goes babbling on and on like a crazy person.
I know. This was the only woman I never lied to. Well thats not entirely true.
No, no that can happen. Ive, uh, Ive read about that in medical journals. Its a freak thing, but...
Oh. What is this?
Really?
Hey, use mine. Ill let you in.
What the hell is this?
I wanna get it back when we were the Gatsbys.
Elaine, of course I'm concerned. I'm payin' for those meals. It's like throwing money down the toilet.
Ah! Peggy. Good to see you.
It's just we want you to go.
You know, we could go uptown, and that way we could give Jerry a ride home.
Nothing. It's not YOU..
I gotta get out of this city.
She's a virgin?
You got the Yankee envelope?
Oh No nonono I'm not a cop ...Heum... I work for the Yankees.
Jerry gargles? Is that why he takes so long?
Party?
What might that cost?
What about these two? Aren't they gonna chip in?
What'd I say? Clara?
Oh, shhh.
Jerry, did you hear that?
Its your apartment!
Because they were heated up there.
Knock it off, just sit in your seat over there you're distracting me. We're making incredible time here. I once went into Kennedy Airport from West 81st Street to in uh, in 15 minutes. hu uh. Oh, here hold this. It's uh, ten dollars for the tolls.
This could have been a huge mistake.
I told her we'd all go out afterwards, okay? And don't applaud when she stops playing the first time. It's not over yet.
Lot of good ones. I don't even want to mention anyone because I'm afraid I'm going to leave somebody out.
Elaine?
Who's Grossbard?
Oh, I had no choice. She squeezed it out of me! Shed tell me she loved me. All right, at first, I just look at her. Id go, Oh, really? Or uh, Boy, thats, thats something. But, eventually you have to come back with, Well, I love you. You know, you can only hold out for so long.
Yeah, eighty-three. Used to belong to John Voight.
Where were you?
He said he didn't care. Oh, God I love that place. Hey, have you seen other dermatologist?
We haven't heard his notes yet, we don't know how he feels about our work. (Russell throws up yet again.)
How do you know?
What?
I don't know.
(Hands Antonio a card) Here's my card. I'm in real estate, so, if you're ever looking for something bigger, something nicer.. (Antonio is staring at him, angered) ..maybe not right now. Anyway.. (Extends his hand for a handshake. Antonio doesn't move)
Nah - what for?
Potato
Salsa is now the number one condiment in America.
(leaving the european accent) No. (laughs)
(out the window) Keith, Keith, up here. Can you do me a favor? I need you to go to the unemployment office with me. I, I'm Jerry's friend  the guy from the locker room,  I'm the chucker. It'll take five minutes. Wait. Wait.
That's really very nice of you, Eva. Thank you.
What?
Like at the airport? (getting excited)
(Sulking) That's why I hate it.
I know.
(animated) Some guy. Some guy? Neil! I have got to find out how he could get a girl like Danielle.
Yeah, yeah. You must have squirted a piece of pulp in it too.
Really?
Siena, I love you.
You look like you're five years old.
Oh no, you're not going out on a high note with me Mr. Kruger!
Okay. "Breakfast At Tiffany's." (Begins to read, but gradually his attention is drawn to the TV Guide on the end table. George realizes there's a show on he wants to see by looking at his watch, and doesn't start the book.)
Oh the ego on you.
Well, I didn't really tell Susan about it, and she doesn't really have anything else to do.
You know, it really can't.
(fever pitch) Marisa Tomei's sitting home, Elaine! Wh..why didn't you tell me that Katy was friends with Marisa Tomei?!
See, I think people would talk about it at the coffee machines.
All these years I've been chuckin' and you've never told me?
For lunch? Who eats eggs for lunch?
Elaine.
Excuse me. Are you using your catsup?
There was no meeting. (gets one of the folding chairs) But it was quite a meeting. You are looking at the next director of Mets scouting. The only thing is, I have to get fired from the Yankees first.
(Trying to whisper to Jerry) Look, we are gonna settle this right now! I demand reparations! I should get to sleep with Elaine. That's the only way to punish you!
There's no G-bone.
Oh I think I'd go for the back.
I can't drive?
You know. You use the, uh...(mutters something unintelligible under his breath.)
Cmon, go for twenty-five hundred. Well do it together. Come on, come on. Were in it together.
I'm good.
So all right I'll speak to you through Jerry and everything.
They should call it round tine. You know what I'm talking about.
Sand. It's everywhere
Finished.
(quiet, desperate) Maybe she can get me another picture of man-hands. (calling) Elaine!
So I tell Alec that I have to go to Paris for an undetermined amount of time. Then all I have to do is buy some post cards and have your parents mail them from Paris.
Whatever!!. . . . Oh oh oh this is unbelievable. This is better than my bed at home.
??? KNOCK OFFS. I NOT GOING TO DO IT! AND YOU'RE GOING TO CALL STEINBRENNER BACK AND CANCEL THE WHOLE THING.
Jerry, I'm not suggesting getting rid of the girl. She's integral.
I can't believe I get paid for this.
S-s-somebody double parked, we couldn't help it. It might have been Saddam Hussein, we're not really sure. He eh, had a British accent though.
All right.
Pulp can move, Baby! Why didn't you eat a real breakfast?
Exactly, but theyre on there  waiting. She said she cant wait to see me, were having dinner tonight. Shes supposed to call me as soon as she gets home.
"Double-dipped"? What are you talking about?
Yes?
I guess so.
No I, I want it if you dont want it.
I know what you were trying to do. Nobody does it better than me.
Wha..? I didn't tell you? I gotta go meet Elaine.
I don't think I could do it. You know, they always remember the first time. I don't want to be remembered. I wanna be forgotten.
Hehummm , Yeah!
Willie. Yeah.
I'm George.. George Costanza.. I've never been in the hospital a day in my life.. except when I had my tonsils out. You know, they never gave me any ice cream. I always felt that-
Well, she's smart. You take my word for it.
Oh, *please*! Me? C'mon! That's *great*! Are you kidding? I think thats fan*tastic*! I've always encouraged experimentation! I'm the first guy in the pool! Who do you think you're talking to?
Duncan Meyers?
What?
I was going to, but then I found out that the auto club has this free locksmith service, so I signed up. Just waiting for the membership to kick in.
Korea.
You've got a bet.
I'm unbelievable at spelling last names. Give me a last name.
Ah. You know, there's gotta be an easier way to open ketchups. They should make it in a tube.
No catchin.
And she'll still see it, you're not stopping her from seeing it.
Yeah, well I'm thinking about getting out of town with Susan for a few days....Her parents rebuilt the cabin!
Who puts a bench in their house?
I guess I should be, but Im not.
What?
It says that on the computer?
Yes, well, if you had never taken your keys back from Kramer, he never would have taken his back from you and given 'em to me, in which case I wouldn't have had to take mine back from her.
Uh.
I hear thee.
Yes, yes of course. The Pensky file. Ho ho, can't wait to sink my teeth into that. Wow that Pensky. Well we'll straighten him out.
I don't think I've ever spoken to her.
"Whhhoooo!!!!"(taps on his desk loudly)
(Only turning back for a second) Hey.
(smug) Ah, I guess I showed Neil who's Neil.
Where's the crazy man, Come on up.
Oh, very gracious.
What's going on? He still wants to have dinner with us?
I'd kill to be a 32.
Jerry, I've been preparing for this moment my entire life.
Oh, my God, No, oh my God, . . . Jerry!
Hey!
Maybe this is what the pilot should be about, vomiting on somebody's vest.
Do you speak English?...English!!
No, I fake limp on my right. This is a real limp because I sprained my ankle.
I like this area. I could live out here.
What's the difference?
We had an incredible phone conversation. We talked for like twenty minutes. I threw away my notes in the middle of the call. You know, I thought she had a great voice timbre. Is it timbre or tamber?
(To his girlfriend) Nina, you have to decide right now. Jerry or me?
Uh, twice what youre payin here, but its a great building. Its two bedrooms!
I told ya. Hey, any of you guys want to come out and help me fix my father's screen door in Queens?
Ah. She's great, isn't she?
Yes, good to see you, too. And Good luck with, uh... with the whole thing, there.
(Defensively loud) It was when I was banging!
How is this effeminate?
(Eating a sandwich) Oh, like you really know busboys.
Finished your thought.
You've got 'shiksappeal'. Jewish men love the idea of meeting a woman that's not like their mother.
I'm not kidding.
I didn't get any bread.
(adamant) It's not cheating if there's no sex!
Is that what I ask for? The BIG salad?
(con't) All right, you know she's got that laugh. What did you say? It's like Elmer Fudd sitting on a juicer?
What does it look like Im doing?
(puts down handset) Because he'll know I told you. Besides, he's giving me a parking spot around the corner for practically nothing.
How do you know? What if pig-man had a two-seater?
Jerry?
You do know Kramer?
Maybe Manya missed the funeral because she was off visiting another galaxy that day.
...she calls me up at my office
What did they do for toilet paper in the civil war?
Here you go.
So, I broke up with Maura. It's done. I'm out.
So, I've got ice cream all over my face. There were no napkins there. Whoever it was that's responsible for stocking that concession stand cost me a relationship.
Were having lunch with a friend. He works in the building.
If not mine, whose?
What is Tungsten or Wolfram?
Ouch!
The woman we bought the wheelchair for?
No, I don't know. How do I know the usual?
Would you get out of here. Who's gonna turn down a chair? I would be very interested to know how he felt about all of this. Maybe I'll have a talk with him.
What checks?
(smiling) That is really nice.
And who's responsible for making hate mongering and fascism popular again?
Pawn shop?
Yeah, yeah, the flower guy. Listen, I know this all sounds a little crazy, but...
Good afternoon. One large crab bisque to go. Bread. Beautiful.
Well, it's about Holly Go-Lightly.
You are aware that Pensky is interested in me.
Do women know about shrinkage?
The pig-man can take the bus.
How much was it?
You don't think I can keep a secret?
Yep. There's one liiiittle problem.
(leaps to feet) Jerry!
I had to listen to a five minute discussion on which one is actually called shmoopy.
(Getting up, he addresses Jerry) All right, remember no rust-proofing. Commit to nothing. If you have to speak - mumble.
She said she liked me. No kiddin' she said that?
But Mr. Cantwell, you... you owe me for the soup...
So you think you can put the suit aside and hold it for me?
145!
I'm sorry I missed it.
Ah, great, great. (sniffs) What's that smell? Smoke? (walks to the kitchen) Hey everybody, I think I smell some smoke back here...(smoke boils into the doorway.) FIRE! FIRE! Get out of the way!
Yeah.
I've got to tell you, I'm really disappointed in Lupe.
More jokes?
What do you think? The brought it over in pieces and screwed it together like a coffee table?
Ohooo what are we going to do? I'm shaking! I'm shaking!
You see. You see! Listen when is your next drawing class?
Yeah. Not only that, this is what she said to me, "Can we change the subject?"
Mister Seinfeld? What about Mister Costanza? I'm not here?
He stole your girlfriend?
I'm very nervous about this. I've never spoken to a mental patient before.
Hey.
You have a car?
But you took me back.
He's a jerk. (nudges to his right but no one is there)
Yeah. No problem.
Jerry, I'm Yankee management.
I know the D is the biggest. I've based my whole life on knowing that the D is the biggest.
What the Hell is a "Polar Bear"?
How's your life? All right?
I don't know, uh...
People are looking for tickets here?
You mean like a bra?
What?
Y'know... I could hear you on the other line...
(To Rachel) And, uh, you eat eggs, right?
Hey, people, people, people, people, people. Not bad, huh? Excuse me.
Yes, please.
What're you gonna do now?
What do I do?! What do I do?!
I'm baby-sitting! Vivian asked me to raise him if she doesn't make it.
hey, you know what? I just remembered something. I had a dream about that guy last night. This is amazing.
(Stuttering) I, I, I, .. here, let me - let me help you..
I'll tell you something, I've never seen a pilot script as funny as this!
(interested) Really?
Imagine if I had to see them both on the same day? (mirthless) Haha! It's like runnin' a double marathon!
(frantic) I'm calling Jerry.
Here, just give me a couple of napkins.
Mine!
You be nice! He's giving me a parking space (echoes) parking space... parking space...
(to Jerry, sarcastically) Yeah, doctor. Im going to have to wait in that little room all by myself, arent I? (He picks up a crossword puzzle.) I better take this. I hate the little room. (George walks into the hallway that leads to the doctors office.) Oh, hello, Doctor.
(taken aback) The actress?
No Don't get the camera , we don't need the camera. Listen I know your skeptical , but I really believe in the Chinese.
Oh, I think it is! I think that's exactly what it is!
You're selling computers?
(singing) Master of the house/Doling out the charm/Ready with a handshake and an open...
This isn't going well.
What do you mean, oh no.
Yeah! Alright, I'm pulling in.
Yeah, the neck hole thing, and I would appreciate it if you would say you're sorry.
(Snaps, then points to the coffee table) Hand me an Emory board.
This is not good. This is not good.
(pauses for a few seconds) OK, I'm tellin' you right now - if your kiddin' around I'm not gonna be able to be your friend anymore. I'm serious about that. You got that.
My favorite.
Can he hear us?
No, no. That's just the thing. Anna told me that Elaine said I was one of the worst seeds she'd ever seen.
Day was -
Aw, that's a fun age. (Jerry looks at George distastefully.)
This is it! It happened to me, Jerry! I was sitting in the restaurant, the two nut jobs were talking - I couldn't take it any more. I got up, and (Makes a noise) I bop into this woman..
And this is the first you're seeing of the coat?
I don't chew gum.
Well why didn't we?
What Consumer? I'm the consumer.
"I'll see you."
Oh! euh.. Yeah We just can't go to the supermarket to get some candy.
Why?
You remember the woman on the horse? She wanted my spot.
No good? All right, uh how about Art... Cor.....
Oh I'm seeing someone, yes. You know her, Daphne Bower.
ho ho ho ho. You know I only got two weeks left of unemployment. I got to prove I've been looking for a job to get an extension
I won't feel like a writer.
It's effeminate to sit like this?
Tell me.
Hi Elaine
So are they coming tonight or not?
You know, like all the comedians always say, 'How would you like it if I came to where you work and heckled you?'
No, no. I-I just want us to be... together.
And isn't it more fun using the urinal?
You know, I'm a little nervous.
Dolores!
Chunnel ?
In college, maybe. Those were fun times.
How so?
It's possible.
Can I uh, can I walk you back to work?
If Elaine wanted to get some coffee.
So uh where are the clothes?
Hey! Saturday night!
What do I do? Well actually, I'm a writer. In fact, I'm writing a comedy pilot for NBC right now.
I told her the truth.
Oh, Huh, imagine that.
Is there a meal allowance? What about seat assignments? Could I have the Kosher meal? I hear the Kosher meal is good. And I need clothes. Gotta get a haircut. Gonna have to, I have to refill my allergy medication. Oh, do I need a hat? I need a hat, don't I? Could we do the Universal tour? They have that Backdraft exhibit now, that looks very cool to me...
I was so shocked I was lucky I said anything.
Maybe hes resting.
Lingerie?
Jon Voight! Are you kiddin' me? Did you talk to him?
Well they're hard to load.
(suspicious) They haven't said anything to you, have they?
(shouting) I'm not looking for another line. I got the line.
What, have you completely lost your mind?
Hey Joey, how you doin'?
Yeah. (Points to two open seats in front of Jerry's. To Nina) Sit down there. (Sees Jerry in the crowd) Hello, Jerry. (Obviously angered at Jerry) I believe you know Nina.
How did you know that?
Hey.
A free ticket?
She can't take it. It's not hers, it's theirs. Once there's no theirs there's no hers, it should be ours.
Sh, sh, goodbye, sh, get away.
Me too, really. Unless you'd really like to get one.
Well I am. Couldn't you try to go through some of that stuff I put in your shoebox?
When I find that guy, this much I vow those glasses will be returned to their rightful owner.
It's my only hope.
That's right.
It was a fat camp. Those kids depended on me.
(quietly) ahh.
I'm too nice.
(oozing fake sincerity) Well, as much as I enjoy all the good-natured ribbing, nothing really makes me happier than spending money on the people I care about.
Pay phone in L.A., look it's a miracle.
Damn it!
...stop pushing. (to Elaine) Kramer spilled ammonia.
Jerry? Yes, I suppose he is white. You know, I never really thought about it. I don't see people in terms of color. You know, there's someone I'd like you to meet. Hand on... (To phone) Is Mr. Morgan in?
Guess not.
The second time I sent the noodles back, I tought she made a face...
It's not real. They're all made up.
Jerry, you gotta talk to Sitarides.
No, no you really look great.
Who are you to play God!? Every man's time comes! If his number is up, who are you to interfere!?
Did you see that? The guy's walking away. What is wrong with you? That was a three hundred dollar profit.
I get the feeling when lesbians are looking at me, they're thinking "That's why I'm not heterosexual".
She missed her period? Oh my god. I can't believe it! I'm a father! I did it! My boys can swim! I can do it! I can do it!
This MacKenzie, he's a bit of a nut. Someone told me he fired the last guy because his nose whistled when he breathed.
All right, all right, two fifty.
Well, this is the Jerry Seinfeld that only I know. I can't believe I just told you that.
Did I tell you?! Did I tell you?!
Listen. You're beautiful. You're intelligent. You'll meet other girls...
All right, I think they have fleas there. So what...
Do me a favor would you? Would you change lanes? Would you get outta this lane. You gotta get out of this lane. This lane stinks. They're all double parked here Please get outta this lane. I'm beggin you please please.
What? Now, you listen to me!
Hi, Elaine.
Yeah. Yeah. With all that kissing and the shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy out in public like that. It's disgusting!
Atlantic City? (thinks) Yes! Yes! I will go to Atlantic City. I'm in. I'm down.
And, um, it was quite good. In fact, you even incorporated me into the show. I'm not actually a performer. Although, my parents felt I had talent..
Where?
I'm gonna slip him a mickey.
Kind of.
look at this guy. Does he have to stretch in here?
You know what I think? I bet she stole a tractor.
All the way?
Oh my God! (coming out of bathroom) You know what I just realized?! If they get divorced an' live in two separate places? That's twice as many visits!
So what do you want me to do?
Those were her exact words, I like George.
Uh. Cheese, pepperoni, eggplant.
Okay, go ahead. Call her, get married, have babies, have a great life.. What do I care? I'm finished. (Really depressed) It's all over for me. In fact, let's end it right now. Jerry, kill me, kill me now. I'm begging you. Let's just get it over with. Be a pal.. Just take the pillow and put it over my face.
That's right, you heard me. Get out! You are ruining this whole experience for me!
Now Peterman wants me to go to the funeral.
Oh, art!
all right! rock-climbing! J..just the 2 of us? alright! hey I'll make some sandwiches, what what do you like? tuna? peanut butter?
I can't perform under pressure. That's why I never play anything for money, I choke. I could choke tonight. And she works in my office, can you imagine? She goes around telling everyone what happened? Maybe I should cancel, I have a very bad feeling about this.
Gotta tell you I'm pretty comfortable.
I got a hotel room.
I suppose I could.
NO!!
I believe that I am about to become the target of a systematic process of intimidation and manipulation, the likes of which you have never -
That's what I'm trying to find out.
See ya later.
We're in Turkey?
What's Yo-yo Ma?
Out of the question.
So, I guess I was lucky that I never tried that myself.
I never tasted a cough medicine I didn't love.
Ahh! How'd she look?
I can't go in there. I can't face the bubble boy.
Who?
Pretend you didn't know it was there. Can you see it?
Oh, please don't tell me you love me again, Jerry, I can't handle it.
Wow, Keith Hernandez. He's such a great player.
That's right. I got his whole car downstairs.
I say fourteen o nine (1409).
(Complaining) I can't read it. I need my glasses!
Ha Ho! (he turns and walks out the door)
You're with a *woman*!
Some sort of electronic thingy.
No, occasionally I'll forget to let the machine pick up. Anyway, they made this large donation, to a women's prison, and I get to go down there and check it out.
The Indian?
Never said goodbye. Never apologized. Nothing.
Of course, not as exciting as miss crop circles, but...
There is no problem. . . just a small miscommunication. Whereby you thanked her instead of the person actually responsible for purchasing the big salad.
Exactly.
Heh he, I made it.
Okay, Okay. Who do you think you're talking to? What are ya' you trying to make a joke, because it's not funny. I can tell you that.
(Again, sarcastic) Oh, what a huge blow to the culture.
I made a mistake.
I'll be O'Brien.
They got a billion people over there and he found a relative.
So, let me ask you. Do you think I could have done this?
(laughs) Yeah, it's me. Is this Clayton?
No, I don't have it yet.
No, no, no, no. Borrowing money from a friend is like having sex. It just completely changes the relationship.
I'm really going to do something with these three months.
Behind the dugout, are you kidding? How did you get them?
Do ya?
Th... this isn't mine.
Take care. Take it easy. (Tom leaves with the casting director)
Oh, oh. Uh, you know. It's the damndest thing. I, uh, I moved recently and my files, pfff, disappeared. Now, I-I don't know if they fell off the truck or if there was some sort of foul play but let me tell you something. I'm not through with that moving company.
So what?
No, you said you didn't like it...
Give me the phone!
Karen.
(resigned) Dammit.
Joe...
(sarcasm) Hu-hu, like I don't know that? (excitement) My Cousin Vinnie, I love that! I, George Costanza, could be on a date with an Oscar winner! An Oscar winner, Jerry! You know what that's like? It's like if fifty years ago, someone fixed me up with Katherine Hepburn? Same thing!
Are you sure?
Give me the phone. (dials) Yea, Hi I would like to speak to Patrice. ... what? ... oh really? ... oh, ok, thank you, ... (hangs up)
Still upset. Very upset.
Elaine's coming up?
(seeing Jerry's van shaking) What is that? That van's a-rockin'.
I know, but antiques are very popular right now.
Oh, it's good.
Well, I don't see how I'm gonna make December. I mean, I need a little more time. I mean, look at me I'm a nervous wreck. My stomach aches. My neck is killing me. I can't turn. Look. Look.
Really?
They said tomorrow, maybe.
Susan loves the sponge.
She doesn't.
Hey, theres Kramer & Darren.
Shh! This is it!
About six years ago.
So, how do you like the way I talked you into comin' down here?
It's in... transit.
Clark Bar.
(Germanic) Ich bin ein sucker.
The truth. you want the truth? It is your earrings It is the chopsticks but it's so much more. You're pretentious. You call everyone by their full name You call my doorman, Sammy, "Samuel" but you didn't even say "Samuel" You went "Sam - U- EL" Papie-eh Mach-eh What is Papie-ay Mach-ay?
I don't even know Peterman. How the hell am I gonna relax? I'm gonna have to be on all night. I don't like being on, Jerry, I would much rather be off.
I went to the hardware store interview.
King Edward. (snapping his fingers) King Edward, Jerry.
Of course I mean that. I am incapable of guile.
What?
'Stanky Hanke'? What did he want?
What! There's no signs here! This is an outrage!
I tried to tear it from the side, you can't get a good grip here. You gotta do it like a bag of chips.
The perfect combination of Mountain Dew and mozzarella...just the right amount of grease on the joy stick...
(angry) Stickin' it!
(on tape, singing) "Believe it or not, George, isn't at home, please leave a mes-saaage at the beep. I must be out or I'd pick up the pho-one. Where could I be? Believe it or not, I'm not hooome." (beep)
Senegal?
huh you tell her
Maybe I can get her locked up.
Bania?
Alright see? We got something there.
The, uh, actor that played Jesus made some odd choices.
It's this way... AND THEY TAKE OFF AGAIN, PAIRING OFF
Oh, there's a difference. It's subtle.
I'll get him to see a real doctor. You just stay away from this.
What?
Oh. Okay, here it is, I got it. She lost her thumbs in a tractor accident and they grafted her big toes on. They do it every day.
It makes me look older.
Seven forty-five.
This catalog is all about how to score in a foreign country.
(leaving to the bedroom) I gave it to Cosmo.
Jerry, I can't talk to Jerry anymore. Ever since he moved into that apartment he's too much ... like you.
That's a picture of me next to the coffin.
Oh.
Well how could you just play your message in front of anybody?
All right. I'm gonna try givin' them fifty-five dollars each... (to Elaine) What do you think?
You'll pay? I'm there.
All right, so what's the penalty here? Let's just pay the fine or something and get the hell out of here.
Hey hey hey, we're in a rush here.
(standing) All right, I'm gonna move my car, my meter's up. Can't park in this city.
Jerry it's funny, Paula and I actually met because of Elaine.
What? I'm comfortable.
So, if I may jump ahead - you're gonna take dog medicine?
Like retouched.
Yeahaha, I gave it a shot (pats Jerry on the arm)... So, any word on the "artiste"? (puts a video in the VCR)
You bought that?
Yeah
I think so.
Thats my candy line-up! Where are all my cards?! Theyre - theyre all on the floor!
It's a cleaning.
Velvet...
Yes, for a sales position. Latex salesman, the selling of latex, and latex related products. They just wouldn't give me a chance.
Why is what I do is so important? Why must I be always the focal point of attention? Let me just be, let me live.
Oh, uh...
No, no....(mumbles)
Shut up!
Well, you got no place to go. I'll tell you what your problem is You brought your queen out too fast. What do you think? She's one of these feminists looking to get out of the house? No, the queen is old fashioned. . Likes to stay home. Cook. Take care of her man. Make sure he feels good.
Did you buy this for me?
Why? Why is my code so important?
Should I give you my keys, is that the transaction, trading keys...? Because Elaine has my keys.
What d'you mean?
I don't want Morgan's job. He's got a lot of work to do. Hey, Elaine, your friend never woke up Mr. Morgan.
So, Im thinking, as shes saying this, Im thinking great, the relationships over. But the egg salads on the way. So now I have a decision Do I walk or do I eat?
" 'course not"
Right.
Why don't you ever go shopping?
You really think this looks O.K. on me?
She says we cant go out anymore.
Newspaper.
You, uh, didn't dance again, did you?
Of course you do.
Of course you can.
Yeah.
Now let's try "breast"... Celeste... Kest...
They made me buy it.. A hundred bucks this thing cost me. (Gesturing to the book) How dare they?! I got news for you, if it wasn't for the toilet, there would be no books.
Wait a second. I think I see where that laser guy is. No! Don't look! Don't look. Oh, yeah, that's him. Ok. I'm gonna sneak up on him. Now the hunted becomes the hunter.
Oh now you're gonna go? ELAINE I'll be back in five minutes.
The *bank*? This is *found* money. I want to *parlay* it. I wanna make a big score!
My presence, in that office, can only hurt my chances.
I learned a lot about myself.
You want my friend to ask his uncle, a man who just lost his wife of 44 years, for a death certificate so that he can save a few bucks on a flight?
I'm not really sure, I...
Vandelay? The judge's name is Vandelay?
He's got Marlon Brando's. I could go to Marlon Brando's house if I really wanted.
Well, you could move in with my parents. (chuckles)
You almost did the nose.
What? Elaine's big-head guy? They have you the apartment?!
I was handcuffed to the bed.. In my underwear, (Sighs) where I remained.. (Scene cuts to another story) She was attractive.. She was, also, infact, a Nazi.. (Cuts to another story) The water.. that I had been swiming in was.. very cold. And, when I dropped the towel, there was.. significant shrinkage.. (Scene cuts to, yet, another story) Her parents were looking at me.. So, there I was, with a marble rye hanging from the end of a fishing pole.. (Scene cuts to his closing statements) In closing, these stories have not been embellished, because - they need no embellishment. They are simply, horrifyingly, the story of my life as a short, stocky, slow witted bald man. (Gets up) Thank you. (Every memeber of the board shows some sign that George's story is most deserving of the apartment. Ricardi is crying. George turns to leave, then remembers one more thing..) Oh, also.. my fiance died from licking toxic envelopes that I picked out. (Sobs and loud crying erupts from the board members) Thanks again. (Leaves. Eldridge looks defeated)
Sic semper tyrannis? What is that, Latin?
So I lugged that table. That big heavy massage table all the way down to the cab! You ever seen one of those things?
Yeah, and I - I heard you got on their good side. Now, what'd you do?
(To a passing waitress) I'll have some coffee and a doughnut.
Fine.
Oh no no no no, don't say anything to Kramer. Susan can't stand him. He vomited all over her.
Tonight's the night, right? Prognosis Negative?
(Reading) I see your G.P.A's a 4.0.
Thanks Roy.
My name is not mentioned in this blurb...
Oh, no no no no. Go ahead, Pop, you always knew your cars.
Kramer, there's a guy out here that...
Fourteen. (shouting after Ken) Fourteen!
Yeah. (Noticing this makes him out to be the bad kid, he gets defensive) Well, I couldn't run over there the way I was!
Yeah, Well that's a deal where I come from.
No but say hello for me.
I don't know what the reason could be.
What's that?
Well, it's a tough decision. I have to wear these every day. I'm deciding on a new face.
Wow. So what're you gonna do?
You would not believe what just happened. I was waiting for you and this woman was sitting at the counter.
What the hell happened to your shirt?
Ooooo, I'm scared. . . . Ohoooo they're not going to do the show.
That's it.
(angrily)"WHY WEREN'T YOU MORE CAREFUL WITH YOUR DROOL!"
Stopped dead.
sweetheart, no come here,  sweetheart
(very worried) Uhm, I, I gotta go.
It was Moops.
Oh, there's a soup stand, Kramer's been going there.
How's it going?
Alright, I gotta go. I'm heading over to Bonnie's.
That guy is not blind.
Hey. Hey. Answer me! Come on, show yourselves!
(Nervous) Nothing.
So I'm sure whatever germs it landed on were knocked out, and by the time the rest of them realised what was going on, you had already grabbed it out.
What happened? Where have you been?
(getting excited) That's, that's incredible. My Cousin Vinnie, I love her, she was fantastic!
She treated me to the Arabian mocha java.
Hey I'll get married if I have to. Al Netchie will think twice before he opens his mouth about me again.
Oh, real good. (George makes a face like you stink) Any word from NBC?
I cheated in the contest.
Ah-ha!
What do think I tell Jerry everything? It's not like he's my wife.
All right, All right, keep your towel on.
No, of course not. I didnt-
Sure, all right. Tell me the rules.
I think that's mine.
Pretty chintzy, huh? Considering the money she makes.. She's a big executive for Federal Express.
She thinks I'm ugly. I knew it.
No, you're not taking a deli slicer to my boss...
What the hell are you two talking about? (All exit)
Take it off. You're going to ruin it.
Excuse me?
Well it's a little strange. You going to start to talk like Elaine from now on?
I guess she did. He's gone, now I'm the man.
Eat me alive, huh? We'll see who can make it in *this* town.
(Rubbing his stomach) Ooh.. Something's not sitting right..
No, no, this wasn't moving on. I got the hook. I wish I could get a lesson in that.
yeah that's right. I like it. He's such a cool guy
I heard they found a family in your freezer
What's the difference? You know they way I work. I'm like a commercial jingle. First it's a little irritating, then you hear it a few times, youre hummin it in the shower, by the third date it's (sings) "By Mennen!".
(astounded) What? So, this is still not over?
(afraid not) No no, no no no. You're not goin' in there.
Are we really doing this?
Really?
Eee-aaa-eee-aaa-eee-aaa...
Fine. (hits his arm on the desk) Ow!
I havent seen him for months.
Well, aren't you the boss of him? You shouldn't let him move up! When I was in the Cub Scouts, I got stuck on Weebolos for three years 'cause I kept losing the Pinewood Derby.
So, what do you think?
Jerry, where y'going? It's... what're...
MOOPS,
Buzz cuts? Parachute pants!
I wouldn't mind seein' <that>.
Yeah.
What for?
No, of course not.
Your parents'll never let you do it.
What time is it?
Oh, Hey, eh, there's a spot right in front of the liquor store. You see
Of course you do... It's just, uh, y'know, I-I never *knew*, uh, that, uh...
Oh, yes, yes, yes. Very, very hard.
That is an opening.
Did you see the way she pointed at the check? She gave me the finger.
Excuse me, I've got a maniac stalking me, I'm not staying in the city.
No! Jerry!
Oh my god....
What are we gonna do? How are we gonna get out of here?
So Anyway, I started to compliment Elaine on her sketches and it turns out,they're Paula's.
Its Martine. I think hes dying. He tried to kill himself with pills.
He gave me a wedgie.
No, no, no potato man. Inka-dink.
You know, when I was a kid, we didn't have these elaborate birthday parties w-with catered food and entertainment. I remember my 7th birthday party...
So, I'm uh, I'm afraid we're going to have to pass.
Yeah. The thing is, I, uh...I had this little zinger of my own I wanted to try.
They wanna have another meeting? They wanna buy it?! They wanna but it?! Oh! I tell you! We're gonna be rich!! What are we gonna get for this? Fifty, sixty thousand?
Well it's not fair, Jerry. It's just not fair. All right, all right. That's it. I'm getting out of this thing.
Lighten up.
I don't know of this is the house. I don't see Jerry's car anywhere.
(Impersonating Carson) I didn't not know that. Weird. Wild. (Susan and George both laugh)
Well, you know, it's really very funny, because you know what we got here, really? We really, really, just have a terrible misunderstanding. You see, when I passed on the deal, I thought that's what Jerry wanted me to say. Y'know, I, I misinterpreted.
Yes. Thank you! Is that so hard?
Yep. Classic horseshoe pattern. I've seen a lot of this.
What?
late June.
That's it?
Chinese food?
Hey, now you're onto something.
Would you mind helping me out with some of this stuff?!?
Are.. are you okay?
I know.
Aunt Baby.
Alright, I'll tell you the truth. I'm not gay. My name's Buck Naked, I'm a porno actor.
Oh, please ... ... four dollars is f...
Hey, me too.
Hey, by the way, what'd you think of Miss Yoshimura?
It's the real deal.
K-I-M-B-R-O-U-G-H
Wow. Excuse me, Miss?
Let's go, people, let's go! It's Prognosis Negative time, wa ha ha ha!!!
Look...humm..I'm on with Beijing with the hair restauration clinic. Could you talk to them for me and tell them I'd like to place an order.
Pbbbs, Bubkis!
Yeah, well, they're my socks!
Oh yes I am
What, you know Kramer?!
I'm trying to buy some of the clothes back. (realizing something) Hey you wanna come over for dinner tonight? My mother made all this extra Paella.
Oh well, that's, uh, thats just because we're, uh, standing on opposite sides.
No, you haven't. Well, maybe you have. What do I know.
What? He's outside?
You weren't thinking.
KEITH HERNANDEZ?
I think Play Now is putting something in my food.
Susan B. Anthony** I think I'd have a problem with.
Well actually I'm...
Because filth is good. Whaddaya think, rock stars have sponges and ammonia lyin around the bathroom? They, have a woman comin over, Ive gotta tidy up? Yeah right, in these matters you never do what your instincts tell you. Always, ALWAYS do the opposite.
Well I guess that's because I wear boxer shorts.
Have a good time.
Jerry! Stop it!
I'm sorry - I have to say, I'm a little disappointed, I thought it would be a lot nicer.
Beautiful women. You know they could get away with murder. You never she any of them lift anything over three pounds. They get whatever they want whenever they want it. You can't stop them.
(laughing) Have something else. Cmon, have a little dessert?
Who told you to sell the card?
(indicates with his head) The cashier.
Oh my God!
So, I could do that?
I can't just leave.
What?
Hey, hey, hey! Whats goin on here? (To Jerry) You didnt agree to anything, did ya?
[Accusingly] What's *that*?
Oh - I've got something.
Hey oh.
Ha, I don't know who she's looking for. I don't know. I'll tell you something. She's very particular, your daughter. Very particular. What is she looking for some big hot shot businessman? Well I've got my pride too. I'm not going to beg her.
I didnt know there was a fireplace.
Hey, hey.
[trying to act as if he doesn't care one way or the other, but we know better] Either way.
Where was pesto 10 years ago?
I know you did.
What difference does it make what she looks like?
Obviously.
Oh no I'm in already come on.
If this lip reading thing works tonight do you know how incredible this is going to be? It's like having Superman for your friend.
Elaine and her sponges...she's got like, a war chest full of them.
(as the others are repositioning the tables) No, no, you can't do that, they're round, it makes an 'eight' and, yeah, well alright.
All right, Puddy, listen, and listen good I need to know the name of that mechanic that walks around here. Big guy, a liar. Short name. Sam? Moe? Sol?!
I dont know. But Simons said that if I wanted to get involved, that Wilkinson would tell me the exact right minute to sell. You wanna do it?
Yeah, me too.
Greetings, people. Greetings. Greetings and salutations. What a beautiful day for a ball game. Let's play two! (Sits down, says to waitress ) Oh, I'll have the chicken salad on rye, my usual, you know what I get, darlin'. (Turns to the Gang) So, let's see, I had a little conversation today with Mr Don Mattingly - (to Elaine) he's the first base man.
I might go there.
Well, wait a little while, Ma. What's the difference?
Because of me? You must be joking! Who wouldn't want to live because of me? I'm nothing!
Where are all the poetry magazines?
(urgent whisper) Elaine! You have got to get me Marisa Tomei's phone number!
Ttu (wipes nose and sniffs) Ttu.
I suppose if I had suggested Liam Neeson Day, you'd all be patting me on the back.
What?
Well, we just blew 240 bucks on a wheelchair.
But I mean look at him. He's gotta be on his feet like that all day? That's brutal. I think I'm gonna say something to your uncle.
I told you.
Well, I've to every Brentano's. This thing's flagged in every database in town!
I have plants. (snorts)
Yeah, yeah. Big advisor.
Well...Susan.
So let's say in her mind she witnessed a pick. Okay, so then what?
I don't know where you're getting this from. I....you're serious aren't you? Oh, (laughing) you see? You see, you just don't know my sense of humor. Dan, don't I joke around all the time?
"Jimmy, right."
Yes sir!
What about that?
He he This guy really gets around.
What's a three letter word for candy?
Yes! I'm not giving him the satisfaction, it's my space.
(coming back in) Alright, alright. Can we go out and eat?
Yeah.
Because. There was a lot of cake lying around the house. Just sitting there going with all the excess milk from all the experiments [grins]
Dad.
Well, we were engaged to be married, uh, we bought the wedding invitations, and, uh, yada yada yada, I'm still single.
(broken, shouts) Gary Fogel never had cancer!
Of course.
What, are you locking the door now?
Well, let's just say it wouldn't exist without me. (Notices another person in the library dressed the same as Celia.) So you two uh, shop at the same store, (hu)?
What's goin'on?
Yeah, well you have to maintain the same disposition too. You can't start acting any differently. You have to be nice.
(shocked and angry) You paid that crook?!
Why not?
Alright, but I'm serious about this.
Oh come on? No come on. She took off her hat and there she was (waving his hand over his head) hello. It was like I was looking at myself in the mirror.
Elaine said your pretty good at this stuff.
Happy? Why should I be happy?
Yeah. Let's go.
This could be in a museum some day! It's not safe with me! It should really be in a doormanned building.
(laughing it off and trying too hard) Yeah, yeah. I have a thing for Marisa Tomei. Like she would ever go out with a short, stocky, bald man. (forced laughter) Hu hu, ha ha. Like that's her type. Huh. She's an Oscar winner. (nervous laughter) He heh. Besides, I don't even know her. It's not like anyone's trying to fix us up. Who, who would try and fix me up with Marisa Tomei?
Let me see that. (Studies the note)
Ooh, a shower cap!
Hey, Mr Lazzari.
Maybe we could call them and ask them to return it.
Well, they were in a rush.
Hey, did you know that the Yankees don't wear cotton jerseys?
Oh, man, it's spinach! I've been walking around like this all afternoon.
Reprogram all the buttons, see if he changes them back. You know? The old switcheroo.
Elaine, get something! Its all taken care of.
Its called Sendrax. Theyve got some new kind of technique for televising opera.
Wait, as a matter of fact, wasn't there some guy in your building that you said you liked? He lived up on the fifth floor or something.
(Muttering, slow) Hang on, Ma.. hang on..
So you're telling me instead of them being happy to see me, they're going to be upset because I didn't bring anything. Ttst --You see what I'm saying?
Well you know in college they used to call me the little bulldog.
I didn't have any sex.
Yeah, but you know where it is.
Elaine, bald men, with no jobs, and no money, who live with their parents, don't approach strange women.
Yeah.
Oh, so it backfired?
(to himself) That's what I'd like to know.
I don't know. (TO ELAINE) Where's Kramer?
You have any idea how fast these things deteriorate when there's an 'I love you' out of the bag? You can't have a relationship where one person says, "I love you", and the other says, "I'm hungry. Let's get something to eat.".
Hi, hi, hi, You were wonderful.
Oh man! I knew I was gonna love the opera.
Duty is *nothing*. It's like sales tax...
(pointedly) Oh, I'm sorry, I require twenty-four hours notice for a cancellation. Now, as I see it, you owe me seventy-five dollars.
Yeah.
The little extra moan you threw in there. Laying it on a bit thick, don't you think?
So you're moving there for spite!
All right. Well, we'll see what happens to you.
(to Jerry) It's all white Jerry! It's all white!
Thats beautiful.
We came in over there!
Elaine, I got to have another picture of Gillian.
We're not dead.
Blanket
What is Borax?
Continue.
(very casual and raising his hand in the air) Yep. That's five!
Because ballpark food doesn't count as real food.
There's an easy move go from screwin' you behind your back to screwin' you right to your face.
Its uh, it's only a few blocks.
What do you mean - "Not letting you?"
Ow! What are you doing under there? Hey, stop that! Don't eat that! That's not food! (to Robin) He's suckin' down Equal packets!
[to himself] Argh! [to Susan] Susan! Hi! Oh, boy! What are you doing here?!
Yeah.
So? Movie tonight?
No one's putting a gun to your head. Do I, uh, scare you?
(To Jerry) No, it's about nothing.
Why, you think you can, beat me up?
I can't eat with you leanin' over like this. Just look straight forward.
Hehe. Well, I got my triangles. (sitting on the couch)
Well, if I could talk to the mothers and have sex with the daughters, then I'd really have something goin'.
Bert... Har... bin... son. Bert Har-bin-son.
It's *not* *true*!
Where, where? I can't see.
(Mocking, skeptic) Yeah, you show us the 900.
But she's gonna know that I like her more than she likes me.
Ah, well, that's very mature. What about you?
