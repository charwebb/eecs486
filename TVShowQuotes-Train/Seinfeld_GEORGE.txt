Don't be silly.
That's what I'm saying.
Are you often on business trip? Nice...oh, hey nice ice-bucket.
Well it's tough to get a good read but I think if I brought him a chair, he'd sit.
Not that Im aware of, no.
Yeah, no pop-in, no "in the neighborhood," no "I saw your light was on." And the best part is, if things go really well...
My back is killing me.
Oh no, thank you.
(insincerely) Ahh, hey you're home. Hi.
What? I'm not married. I'm not allowed to go out with somebody else?
Hi. George.
When?
She hasn't seen the article! When she sees it, she's gonna think-- *I'm out baby*!! I'm out!!!!!
I'd kill to be a 32.
"I'll see you."
(let down) So, that's it?
I'm just sayin' I wanna have some fun.
You shouldn't have tucked.
Great.
We do?
Hello Stu.
Right, your friend Roy.
Yeah, there was a fire in my apartment.
What is that? B.O.?
Bosomy?
The point is I was here first.
(chuckles) Bye, thanks. (To Jerry, when Susan is far) I can't believe she took the money.
I guess I've been hanging on to them for so long cuz i couldn't accept the fact that Dad was really gone forever (hugs a piece of clothing)
Cause its all in the greeting.
Oh..
So, how do you like the way I talked you into comin' down here?
Of course, not as exciting as miss crop circles, but...
Elaine, you have to sleep with me.
It was on a magazine! And it still had the doily on.
You want me to roll six thousand of these?! What, should I quit my job?!
That's right, you heard me. Get out! You are ruining this whole experience for me!
What the hell is this?
I don't know, it sounds like pigeons or something!
You don't tell him?
(To a passing waitress) I'll have some coffee and a doughnut.
No. And he's not a pig-man is he?
(quieter desperation) They took my belt, Jerry. I got nothing to hold my pants up. (listens) Well, you gotta come over here now! Just tell 'em what we talked about, how I, how I, I didn't do the project.
(to Carrie) You know, you're really being very selfish. It would be nice if you would think of someone other than yourself every now and then!
I guess I should be, but Im not.
I am not! What you call wasting, I call living! I'm living my life!
Oh, nothing...
Out? Oh no, I've been to four other places, you're the only ones that have had it.
I don't want you to call.
What are you crazy?
He's on vacation.
Well, Jerry's car gets hit and the other driver doesn't have any insurance, so the judge
Is it, uh, doable?
You did that?
This townhouse?
Uh, let me ask you a question. Could you, uh, expand the space underneath a desk to give it a little more headroom?
(through mouthful of food) So, Carrie, you and Susan are cousins. So your baby daughter is gonna be Susan's second cousin, right? So what does that make me?
You wanna see?! (pulling off the hat to reveal the bald pate) There! There it is! (turning to Newman) Alright, here! You wanna try on the hat?! Here! Try on the hat!
Really? You like it? I got it at a flea market today.
I'm gay! I'm a gay man! I'm very, very gay.
Who puts a bench in their house?
What, did you go swimmin'? It's 29 degrees out!
I'll fake an illness. (Acts it out) My back! My back! I can't believe, my back.
Shut up?
Jerry? Yes, I suppose he is white. You know, I never really thought about it. I don't see people in terms of color. You know, there's someone I'd like you to meet. Hand on... (To phone) Is Mr. Morgan in?
Rest stop supply.
I can't come out. They're standing right by the door. Throw it up!
MOOPS
No, Seven.
Who am I going to meet who is better than her? No one, Jerry. No one's better than her.
So, uh...wanna double?
Cause I tell you, frankly, I would like to walk in hear one day and find you sitting down. (Starts to walk out of the store) That would give me a lot of pleasure. Call me crazy.
Are you crazy? This is like discovering Plutonium ... by accident.
(he just took a bite of the Chinese food ) This is terrible. What is this, ginger? I hate ginger. I can't understand how anyone can eat ginger. (puts the container back in the refrigerator.)
That reminds me, I'm not getting you guys any more fruit. That guy was eyeballing me the whole time. He gave me the creeps. All right, you owe me twenty-eight sixty.
This is my ketchup. I bought this ketchup just so I could have as much as I want.
(bewildered) Heh heh.
Too bad , it's all done.
Jerry, the Mets lost.
This friend of Susan's is staying with us for two weeks...Now am I wrong or is that excessive?
Oh boy.
Nothing.
Uh Jerry, how long will you be in there?
If she want's to continue to have a fibre of her being she'll be very careful (hitting each other)
(grabs the phone quick) Got it, Got it,...Hello?
Thank you for leaving me alone with him!
Right. And, and to cover my nervousness I started eating an apple, because I think if they hear you chewing on the other end of the phone, it makes you sound casual.
Have you seen Jerry? (sitting beside Elaine) I told him two o'clock.
What? What did you do?
Shouldn't we at least drop off your bag?
Hey, at least I was a camp waiter.
Because my parents happen to be two pretty wonderful people.
Oh, I understand. (George exits; Sees Kramer in the hallway) Hey.
(quiet) Uh-oh.
No. Definitely not.
(Laughs, snorts) I said, I said 'Get outta here! No story? Is that what I said?'
(pauses) A marine biologist?
Its fabulous.
My god!!!
I'm sure I will.
Sometimes, once in a while.
Oh, well th-that's great. It's really great. Hm hm mm.
I watched "Beaches" on cable last night. (wings?)  Give me a break.
God.
I saw them making out, you can believe it.
What mail?
He wouldn't put it on if he didn't like it.
Cosmo
Slippery Pete, Kramer tells me you are one hell of a rogue electrician. And shlomo, you're the best truck driver.
What is this? Did you ever get the feeling like you've had a haircut but you didn't have one? I'm all itchy back here.
(dismayed) I didn't even know you wanted to get serious!
Absolutely.
Uh...no.
He was definitely sniffing.
I'm not kidding, you should do it.
I've been standing here for the last ten minutes!
Look at these salesmen. The only thing these guys fear is the walk-out. No matter what they say, you say, "Ill walk out of here right now!"
Moops!
What'd you ask me for?
You know what? I changed my mind. I, uh, I don't think so.
No, not really.
He's extremely Murphy. He's Murphy to a fault.
I'll leave when the guy comes in. I gotta tell you, I am loving this yada yada thing. You know, I can cross over my whole life story. (Picks up dental tool)
Whyie?
Marla.
Maybe I need someone who doesn't speak English.
How was the show?
Aahh..No..No..
Cross the wires? I can't even make a pot of spaghetti.
Id like to have a kid. Of course, you have to have a date first... Remember my friend, Adam, from Detroit?
Well I was lost, I never saw the first one. By the way, you mind if I watch it here?
No thanks.
The show will be like a heart attack!
Yeah. I'm Buck Naked.
Listen, sweetheart, let me tell you a little something about guts. (Points to his head.) This is guts.
... so glad.
He's Keith Hernandez. You're Jerry Seinfeld.
So? For a twenty-five dollar cleaning, I can listen to some pointless blather.
Oh, very gracious.
Where did you get that from?
Yes. Very nice to have had her to mention... (starting to leave)
Well, at least, I'm not carrying a purse.
Yeah, Well that's a deal where I come from.
There was no meeting. (gets one of the folding chairs) But it was quite a meeting. You are looking at the next director of Mets scouting. The only thing is, I have to get fired from the Yankees first.
I don't have a spare set. All my keys say 'do not duplicate'.
I thought were a team.
He's with the touring company of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. He's the guy in charge of the wigs.
What idea? I just said something. I didn't know you were going to listen to me.
"...It's the chicken"
(staring at the wreck) Whatever.
Thirty.
Uh, yeah. Do you know Babs?
You had to move the mirror?
What about Six?
Oh... make it stop.
Yes, yes, she had a nose job. I loved her very deeply. Will she ever speak to me again?
Yes, full. I love to be full ... love to sit back, loosen the old belt and digest away for hours. Let those enzymes do their work.
Jerry! Over here Jerry. It's me!
(Inquiring about the chalk board) What is this?
Wait wait wait, what is she... (takes the milk can from Jerry and puts it on the table) What is she like?
That's right.
What exactly is mutton?
How would you like a 'Hare Krishna' fist on your throat, you little punk?
No, not nervous. I'm good, very good. (A beat, then he snaps) I can't do this! Can't do this!
(Obviously knows that, but pretends he doesn't) What, tonight? Now?
No Doctor--
Oh, I think it is! I think that's exactly what it is!
Mind? Why would I mind? I would love to wait! (shakes hands with Nana) Nana, nice to see you. Ni-ni-ni-ni-NANA! (embraces another guest, kisses her) Aunt Phyllis, always a pleasure. What a pleasure! Hey, let's do this again real soon. I had fun, huh?
Huh. Really?
Yeah, she's a sweet ride.
What about these two? Aren't they gonna chip in?
Krama. Open up! I--I know you're in there!
Yes, because the water was cold... and the chewing warms me up.
Ah, shut up, Jerry. My parents think they can ignore me. Heh heh. Well, they better think again.
This guy from my old neighborhood. Lloyd Braun. He's a big advisor to Mayor Dinkins. He thinks he's so cool.
That's right, Ricky Boy, it's me!
(Smiling) Nothing.
(embarrassed/self-conscious about his gut) Do I? Thanks.. You too..
Listen uh, David, I, I, I want to apologize about that comment
Yeah, it's me, I just got home.
If not mine, whose?
Kramer! You can't go! Who's gonna do the feats of strength?
How come?
(pulls a face) I find it disorienting. Who buys an umbrella anyway? Y..you get 'em for free in the coffee shop in the metal cans.
I can't be blind, Jerry The blind are courageous.
This is *unbelievable* B.O.
(more nervous) What are you talking about?
A wheelchair? What for?
She had an itch. She could have used any one of those fingers. That finger was meant for me.
Gee, Kramer, I uh...I don't know what to say.
You tell that son of a bitch no Yankee is ever comin' to Houston. Not as long as you bastards are running things.
I just don't like the idea that any time theres a dinner invitation there's this annoying little chore that goes along with it.
Pull hair, Poke eyes, Groin stuff. Whatever I gotta do. (he opens a blue bottled beverage)
He eats those?
Pasta primavera! Back on the horse.
Yes sir!
So, Jerry and Nina, huh?
Potato
What does she need? Maybe there's something that she needs.
(dramatically) A what?
What's it say?
What?
... Those spastic shnitzer twins ...
You've got a bet.
(laughs hysterically, gesticulating wildly) This is all blowing up in my face! My serious girlfriend, and my torrid love affair have accidentally crossed paths. I have ruined three lives... (grabbing coat) Well, I understand if you never want to see me again, so... (points towards door)
(Still on the showers) Can I use hot water on my face?
No not vast (he pronounces it as "vost")
She doesn't Want to talk, she needs to talk.
Yeahaha, I gave it a shot (pats Jerry on the arm)... So, any word on the "artiste"? (puts a video in the VCR)
Help! Someone!
How do I know, maybe, you know, maybe she wanted to be polite.
Yep. There's one liiiittle problem.
Well, I don't see why if you have his, he should have yours.
Shst, You should take the test for me.
He left... huh... Carl, you hungry?
You know you buy a big salad for somebody it would be nice if they knew it.
Why? Why isn't it possible? I mean, they're both bite marks.
Hey-- (spots Donna)
You know I still don't know how you can call lunch with me a business expense.
Oh well, that's, uh, thats just because we're, uh, standing on opposite sides.
Oh... do I have to write him a note or something?
What?
Good morning, sir.
Take care. Take it easy. (Tom leaves with the casting director)
Split it. Pretty good. Talk about game six?
Hey-hay! Lloyd! Hey! My friend Jerry eh.
Yeah, right. I'll just go up and say, "Hi, how ya' doing? Would you like a glass of white wine?" JERRY Before you got within twenty feet of this woman, she'd have her finger on the mace button. She's like an expensive car with one of those motion-sensor force field alarms. Any sudden movement in the area could set her off.
Hey, maybe I could bribe one of those women that hand out the towels in the powder room.
No, he doesn't know O'Brien, if he knew O'Brien he wouldn't have a sign. Let's just do it.
Smile.
(Threatening) Hold it! One more step and were walkin!
Maybe she wasn't! Maybe she heard the whole conversation!
A what?
You owe me ten dollars.
(aggravated) Oh, that's not good enough! You don't try and de-sour. You have to sweeten too!
Definitely.
It's a bit hilly - no?
What?!
Just take it off. I'm getting hot just looking at it.
So, is he okay?
Yes. The legends are true.
This is a *great* idea! Here... use this one. I get frequent flyer miles with every purchase... Wait! Get two tickets. As long as your turning it in for a refund what's the difference? I'll get *double* the bonus miles.
I'm not getting a Penthouse Forum.
I'm starving...
Uh, Tim, the pencil...
Handicap? (gesturing to his cane) Oh, I'm not handicapped.
(Offering) Drink?
No! Theres no coconut!
Ok, thanks.
(As the Twix starts to move) Ha, ha, ha, ha! (The Twix gets stuck in the spindle right before falling. George begins to pound the machine) Come on! Jump!
We'll come up with something.
So she doesn't want to see me anymore.
(pleasant surprise) Really? (admonishing) You know Gary, I really have to say, I'm a little bit hurt that you didn't decide to confide in me.
(crafty) Not necessarily. Why don't you take back the couch you gave me?
I don't know, about three days.
(negative) Hu-ho, boy.
Well, it worked when I met George Peppard last week.
I dont know. Theyre books.
Hey, don't embarrass me today. I got some friends in the stands. (George makes a swinging motion with an imaginary bat and pulls something in his back.)
I'd like to rent Breakfast At Tiffany's.
So all right I'll speak to you through Jerry and everything.
I wouldn't hear of it, Todd. It's none of my business. But you should try to find out everything you possibly can. In fact, I'll even stay all the way on the other side of the room just so there's no chance of me overhearing anything.
(To Jerry) Let me ask you something.. How much do you think it would cost to have tonsils and adenoids removed in the hospital?
Do you ever just get down on your knees and thank god that you know me and have access to my dementia?
The table, the stereo, the VCR, the velvet couch, where's the velvet?
Missing his plane? Wasn't that a charter flight?
Doing quite well, thank you. Yesterday I had a soft boiled egg and a quickie. You know what? If I could add TV to the equation, that would really be the ultimate.
Hi, how are ya? (They kiss)
No? Are you crazy?
Grass
Twenty-five percent? It was your idea.
You know, Ive been thinking. I cannot envision any circumstances in which Ill ever have the opportunity to have sex again. Hows it gonna happen? I just dont see how it could occur.
You don't believe me? Ask Jerry.
Alright, the dentist thing was not good.
Hey, Mr Seinfeld. (shakes Morty's hand) Hey, Mrs Seinfeld. How are you?
Why didn't you just say that?
What, what happened? Where's, where's all the stuff?
He frolfs, he scores...(he drops one invitation on the stairs.)
That's it?
Your boyfriend reads the Daily Worker? What is he? A communist?
Certainly not.
What'd I say? Clara?
Boy, even I never heard that one...
Well, I think Poppie's got some problems. There's a whole other thing going on with Poppie. So how did you leave it?
(to Jerry) It's all white Jerry! It's all white!
I sold your clothes yesterday.
Nah, it's not a good turn. December. December. Don't you think we should have a little more time just to get to know each other a little.
No, say. I want you to say.
Uh, nothing, lets get going. Come on. (laughs) hu hu.
Yeah.
(getting annoyed) Hang on, it's warming up!
(spits out mouthful of food) Mrs. Enright! Mrs. Enright!
I wasn't talking to you.
What, you're gonna take her word over mine? I'm your best friend!
Oh.. nice.
I dunno they said maybe.
It's George
Yes!
All right. I don't.
How do you know?
You start flirting with him and I'll come by and, while you're keeping him busy, I'll slip it in his drink.
Moths?
Gimme a half-hour.
Jon Voight, the actor?
Tim, who's the head of the Aryan Union, you or me?
(talking to nobody) Nah. It's probably a union thing.
We'll have a good time
George
Yes, you know. Deal with it .We have to deal with the doubt, Susan The DOUBT!! Must be dealt with.
Oh, yeah. Still in good with the ground crew. (Laghs)
I really can not comprehend how stupid people could be sometimes. Can you comprehend it?
What are you looking at me like that for?
Hey. I've kept the same job for more than two years. It's not luck. Elaine, have you ever sent a racy photograph of yourself to anyone?
(thinking) This guy's perfect.
He didnt seem too pleased.
Well, I was 14 years old. I was in my friends bathroom. His mother's brassieres were hanging on the shower rod and I picked it up, studied it. I thought, I like this. I didn't know what way or what level, but I knew I wanted to be around brassieres.
Would it kill him to check up on us? No - drops off the meals and that's it. I realize we're prisoners, but we're still entitled to catsup.
(to a street vender selling hot dogs) You must hate hot dogs, huh? Or else, you, uh, you really like 'em and that's why you, you do this.
(Sees Gwen's meal) Hey, soup.
UH, ha ha, ... It's just SO frustrating. It's a brand new jacket.
and SUSAN (nod)
Just take the cap off.
I dont know, what? Eight thousand. Its a Hyundai. Get out of here. I told you not to sell. Simons made money, Wilkinson cleaned up.
(Sincerely) Thank you.. I, uh.. that might not work out.
Shhhhh. If you want to get in, theres very little time. (calling to the waitress) Sweetheart.. (Waitress approaches and tears off a check. George stops her.) No, no, no. That ought to cover it. (He hands her some money; she turns to leave; George stops her.) Just a second. Just a... let me jus-peek... (He looks at the check, then takes some money out of her hand. George urges Jerry and Elaine to eat.) Come on, come on, come on...
Aha. Aha. Could it be because you don't want him to know that you have a friend who pees in the shower, is that it?!
I'm at the health club and while I'm in the pool, some guy walks off with my glasses. Who steals prescription glasses?
(laughs - hehe) Well, first, I'm brushing my teeth and this piece of apple-skin, that must have been lodged in there for days, comes loose.
Definitely.
You think she should have said something?
Yeah, just tell him to hurry it up.
Nah, he didn't have anything to do with it...
I don't understand what the big deal is. They let you try on pants.
And, Ill have a club soda with no ice.
I saw Amy making out with your cousin Jeffrey.
What was that?
Ssssso, after me, you... went that way?
. All right , just give me my car and let me get the hell out of here.
late June.
Well, yeah.
(phone rings ,picks up) Operator? Beijing?
(smiling) Yes sir.
Hey look, he's back.
(sitting) Newww tuxedo. For the Pinstripe Ball. Steinbrenner is throwing a huge party at Tavern on the Green, heh!
Uh, le - let's go do, something.
Hi, we're from the United Volunteers, we've come to pick up the TV.
91 dollars.
Bar?
(motioning Jerry to follow) C'mon.
What? I don't see anything.
Listen, you go over to the ticket counter, I'm going to go stop in the gift shop and pick up a copy of Time magazine. There's supposed to ba blurb about Jerry in it and I think he mentioned my name!
Oh, that's funny
I don't want to hear it, Kramer!
(Aggravated) Well, I got screwed on the donuts. There were none left. Heh!
(after Wendy and to the receptionist) Oh, you have a policy! (to the world at large) The delicate genius has a policy! George heads for the door.
Right.
I don't think so.
Bear with you! This is a parking lot PEOPLE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO GET
Well you should have been O'Brien.
Coming to the airport with us?
He had a TV show! He had cartoons!
I mean, we're not stupid, right? We know when something's funny!
Hup, here we go. Here we go.
W-ca-What did they do?
Latex, latex manufacturing
Whoop! Too late. I think he picked up the scent.
I thought the thing you said about the sex not being simulated . That was really funny.
Ill tell her I bumped into you, Im giving you a ride uptown.
That's it?
I'm not kidding.
No, why, what's happening?
Is it?
Yeah!
I would like an apology.
Yeah.
Uh, please, Morty.
Well I gotta undo what I did.
May I help you?
He said he didn't know what it was.
I, I really should go home. Ya.. actually I'm planning on spending the day with my father tomorrow (short laugh) we're uh we're going to a father-son picnic, just the two of us.
(Still standing) So, you're gonna sit there?
Well, unless you tell everybody you're dating.
He did it right as he said "her unfortunate accident."
Yeah, that is odd, isn't it?
It's good. Believe me.
This woman just set me up for a job!
Get outta here..
Uh, excuse me, uh, um, Jason. I don't want to get into a big thing here, but... I'm not sure if, technically, what you just said was actually an apology.
Well, it's just a game. Remember that, kids.
I know! I was squinting.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. As long as youre going to lie to the guy, why dont you tell him that you lost both of the tickets, then we can go?
(Hands Antonio a card) Here's my card. I'm in real estate, so, if you're ever looking for something bigger, something nicer.. (Antonio is staring at him, angered) ..maybe not right now. Anyway.. (Extends his hand for a handshake. Antonio doesn't move)
That is what I want.
So what? Thats good.
So, you know, she calls and says she wants to go out with you tomorrow night? God bless! Devil you!
Would you take her out?
Is Ted Danson's deal standard?
You mean alias.
"There's a lot of money in this.. He's got a proven sales method"
That's right. It's just me and her.
Well, maybe they're done with it. I could go pick it up.
So, you gonna buy his art?
(sighs) Guess not. What should I do?
'Maybe you know some little places to go, where they never close...'
What, you didn't ask him about the car?
Right. Bye.
Oh no I'm in already come on.
Regards?
(little worried) Coffee? (thinks) I can beat that. Move in with me.
Honesty, hard-work, these are the values that I was raised on. The most important thing Joey, is to be able to look yourself in the mirror before you go to sleep at night.
An apartment complex, the uh the Eiffel Towers. uumm Like I said uh you'll be getting a postcard uh in a few days and again I'm sorry.
Did you tell her anything?
Well, you know, I've been lyin' about my income for a few years. I figured I could afford a fake house in the Hamptons.
Nice to meet you.
Who flips? Youll flip, Ill call.
Huh... Cape... (turns, distracted, heads slowly towards door) What was a man with a cape doin' with my father?... What was my father doing with a man in a cape?... (opens door) Why a cape? Hmm! (exits)
How so?
Well, how good a look did you get?
Oh! euh.. Yeah We just can't go to the supermarket to get some candy.
Hello.
Dad, you know what it takes to compete with Microsoft and IBM?
Out. (Jerry shakes his head in agreement) Wow. I spend so much time trying to get their clothes off, I never thought of taking mine off. (Jerry nods; George looks at his watch) Alright, Hey come on, get out of here, Dophne gonna be here any minute.
Nice to meet you.
The death certificate?
Let me tell you something about that tag. It's no 31, and uh...let's just leave it at that.
What happened to the raisins?
Yes, In fact, her mother is in the hospital right now. It's some kind of a Diverticulitis. (he continues walking slowly towards Steinbrenners desk)
Great! (snaps fingers and grabs the extra plane ticket) Nina could go, huh? Jerry, this is great. You and Elaine. Me and Nina.
I don't know where you're getting this from. I....you're serious aren't you? Oh, (laughing) you see? You see, you just don't know my sense of humor. Dan, don't I joke around all the time?
I was not winking you idiot. That was the grapefruit. It's like acid. I need that card back. It's Mr. Steinbrenner's. I was responsible.
You know, like the general manager of a baseball team or something.
(surprised) Rosses.
Maybe Manya missed the funeral because she was off visiting another galaxy that day.
I got another meeting with Reilly. A whole new audience, and I bet I can get him to try that line again.
Hey, where ya goin'?
Yeah. Just confirming.
(sensing his chance) Well, they do now. Neighborhood's changing.
When?
Elaine said your pretty good at this stuff.
Looks like veal.
I have plants. (snorts)
This is fantastic. Man, what a weekend. Swimming, lobster for dinner...
You're gonna tell me...or not.
But why?
(Smiling) You got it, Ma. (She smiles back, nodding) A little later. (George sits back in a nearby chair, looking at the divider in anticipation)
Huh?
Diane DeConn? You saw Diane DeConn!
Oh No nonono I'm not a cop ...Heum... I work for the Yankees.
We ordered the wedding invitations today,, Nothing can stop it now. Nothing. It's here! It's happening. Can I do this? I can't do this...Look at me. Look at me I can't do this, I can't do this (manic) Help me Jerry, help me.
Ah, well, you know we gotta been running because of the ...
Some sort of electronic thingy.
Really...(he honks the car and is startled, Elaine laughs)......I have to say...You were really good doing that porno thing....you're talented.
Hey, Mr. Morgan how was your massage?
(shifty) Yeah.
That's the question, Jimmy.
Tell the cop.
See, didn't bother Susan either. That's why I'm different. I can sense the slightest human suffering.
Really? What does it mean?
Let me just say this. It is inhumane to make a man stand on his feet, in one spot for eight hours a day. Why shouldn't he have a chair?
Yeah for two hours. She's nuts about you.
Continue.
Tell you how you could check.
Probably. They all do. In my high school, half my graduating class had them. Of course, I'm from Long Island, so...
All right. There's nothing to be worried about. She's just a little annoyed right now. Tomorrow I'll personally go over there. I'll apologize. I'll get the papers. Don't worry. Don't worry. (exits)
I'm sure I have a low IQ. I've been lying about my SAT scores for 15 years.
Are you kidding? I lie every second of the day. My whole life is a sham!
Let me tell you something. No one walks into a beauty parlor and says "Give me the Larry Fine."
You mean in the end?
Thats it! Thats it! I cant take it. I cant take it anymore! You stole the statue! Youre a theif! Youre a liar!
Can't we just fix the old one?
I could see that...
(from bathroom) How was Eric Roberts as the husband?
I'm following him.
Same thing. My god, I'm getting married in December, do you know that?
Sweet guy (Receives the phone from Beth, Starts to talk to Jerry) Hello
Yes. With a little guidance, Steven Koren is going to be everything I claim to be, only for real. That's my dream, Jerry.
Of course! Alright, maybe I'll say something to Buck.
You're not out there! You can't be, because *I* am out there. And if I see *you* out there, there's not enough voltage in this world to electroshock me back into coherence!
The show is about nothing.
I cant. I met them. Theyre devout. You know, in the cab on the way over here, I actually thought about converting.
Percentage?
So, what do you think?
But I know who took the bite. It was her aunt!
Are you through?
Hey, Kramer, what are you doing Tuesday?
Woo! Courtside! (mock-snide) Is that the best you could do? Ha ha!
Yeah, hell have my parents.
Nah.
Of course.
Hi Connie, Jerry around?
It's funny! (To Elaine) and it wouldn't kill you to not be so funny either.
Did you ever meet my friend, Simons?
Yeah, how did you know that?
Well I've done that.
I dont know why you even bother with this ping pong guy, Ill tell you that.
She told this couple she had an affair with a matador.
Nothing. It's not YOU..
Sometimes in life, the gods smile upon you, my friends.
Excuse me. Can I talk to you for a second there, Watkins?
(Looking at his finger) I think somethin bit me. I just need another nickel.
Haaaaaa!!!
The Chinese have done it my friend. The Chinese have done it.
How come this sweater is only 85 dollars?
You ditched me. That's twice. Now I demand to know what's going on!
I don't understand lunch, I don't know anything about lunch. Listen. Just because I got the guy fired doesn't mean I turned him into a bum - does it?
I don't know. I do know that I have some kind of a talent - something to offer. I just don't know what it is yet!
To be polite. I rest my case.
(outside, looking the guy trying the suit through the window, and thinking out loud) What's this? Can't I leave this place for a second? (goes in, take off his jacket, walks to the guy and talks to him with an european accent) Can I help you?
Mom? Dad?
What about the whole Christmas spirit thing? Any flexability there?
Oh, yeah.
It'll take to long.
Three days. Well, maybe you caught her on the cusp of a new wash cycle. You know, she did laundry the day after she met you, everything got clean and she started all over again.
So you're gonna let me get suspended for shower urination?
Kramer. Anything good in there? Any Popsicles?
Five' eight. Five' seven.
Yeah. But it was somebody's arm.
That was very real.
Hey, Cosmo what happened to your mother last night. She hung me out to dry.
All right, all right. Thats it. Im gonna go down there.
An apartment-warming gift? We got to give presents to people for moving? Birthdays, Christmas, it's enough gifts. I would like one month off.
I know Jerry. He has this phobia about public toilets. I think we really should go upstairs.
No, it's nothing bad. I'm getting married.
(dread) Oh god.
Yes, a shame. That is exactly how I would put it. Now Mrs. Sweedler, with all due discretion and sensitivity, and taking in the whole scope of the situation, I just can't help but think that, the hospital is somehow responsible for compensating the other, still living 'victim' of horrendous, horrendous tragedy.
Going to need a little more coffee here.
(bursting out of the bathroom, fumbling with his fly) Button fly! Why do they put buttons on a fly? It takes ten minutes to get these things open!
*No*...
Did you ever solve the riddle of the pie?
Not exactly. What does that mean?
Just for these sponges?
We go into NBC.
That was no good?
And-and you just decided to pop in...!
(attempting sincerity) As much as I'd like to see the two of you living it up in a warm, tropical, setting, I, I would just miss you too much. (smiling) So, I've decided, I want you to stay.
Wyck.
Stop it, stop it! It's not fair. It's not fair. I don't like this situation, Jerry. I don't like it one bit.
Y'know the average life span for an American male is like, 72. You're really... kinda pushin' the envelope there.
The... drivel... parts. Oh my gosh, I just realized  I have to make a phone call. I-I cant believe- Would you-
Oh, here we go...
She's a virgin?
Really good?
Im not gonna watch you do laundry.
You see this is the thing. . . . (crying) I just feel . . . mumble, cry, mumble, . . . I'm scared. You and I together, (cry)
How much?
Robin, listen to me. The most amazing thing has happened. Kramer has opened my eyes. I think I've changed.
You saw Jane topless?
Whatever.
(after hesitating, resignedly) All right. (He sits down and smiles unconvincingly at her)
Yes, but I am not taking it.
What for?
What, I'm puttin' my shirt back on.
Yeah, woman have no problem getting the hand off. How do they do that?
Okay.
How do you know him?
You think Kramer'll do it?
Outside of Manhattan, about an hour ago.
What's a three letter word for candy?
(to Elaine) He asked you to get the mail?
Gammy's gettin' upset!
She asked me to.
Aw, Mr. Kruger, Sir. Merry Christmas! (Hands him a card)
You got aloe? I love aloe.
Jerry, would you make the call already?
Why? Because we're a team! C'mon! Would you take this for us, dear? Thank you very much. Here we go... (To Morgan) Anyone ever tell you you look a lot like Sugar Ray Leonard? Yeah, you must get that all the time.
Lena, how'd you meet her?
Who!!?
I know who it was too. It was the guy who interviewed me. He was very threatened by me. Why else wouldn't he hire me? I could sell latex like that (snaps fingers).
Thanks again.
"Argh!!..Anyway...Jimmy couldn't be here today so he asked me to fill in for him, and I'm sure that you'll be impressed at what can be accomplished after only a few short days of training.....yeah!"
You got it.
Please.
Jean-Paul?
Yeah. So, how's Cindy the maid?
Why not?!
Good. I think you forgot something.
Hey.
So, maybe this should be it.
Hello.
With extreme prejudice.
So I'm sure whatever germs it landed on were knocked out, and by the time the rest of them realised what was going on, you had already grabbed it out.
(to phone) Hi, Allison? Oh, I guess you're not at home.. I probably should 'ave tried you at the office. Anyway, good to hear from ya, really looking forward to the ball.. (hangs up and happily chuckles) Ha ha!
I'm not gonna be nice. That's how I got the job.
Really? Coco?
Oh, art!
God, you're like a rock star.
I had a great time tonight Carrie. And I am going to call you as soon as I get home.
What are you doing?
I'm good.
So the plan is to secretly sterilise her mouth?
You know, it's a miracle you're not married. (beat) Hey, I'm not obligated to buy anything, am I?
*Really*.
No good?
(quietly) Ya.
Why do you keep saying Nina?
I'm too nice.
Umm... No.
I'm positive I gave you a twenty.
But I'm paying you!
Yeah, thanks.
Why not?
Ah. You know, there's gotta be an easier way to open ketchups. They should make it in a tube.
Teasing.
You mean, like, a former member?
Check that out (showing newspaper)
Yes. Yes. You know what's interesting. The quarterback for the Atlanta Falcons is Bobby Hebert. No "r" which I find fascinating. You know it's Herbert h-e-r-b-e-r-t, Hebert h-e-b-e-r-t. "Hebert" it's a fun name to pronounce. Try and say it Hebert. Take a shot. All right. (check arrives) All right. I
Aah! the minute I saw this girl, we just clicked. She's got such a nice face. hummmm her eyes, her mouth, nose
Hi, I was just uh... I just had one little question about uh, my assignment.
Speak now, or we are headed to the Hamptons. It's a two-hour drive. Once you get in that car, we are going all the way... to the Hamptons. All right, you wanna get nuts? Come on. Let's get nuts!
here Elaine here, Superman (hands a comic book to Elaine, who passes it to Tony) please, next time it will only be the two of us
A woman that hates me this much comes along once in a lifetime.
Five minutes. What the hell happened here?
They are?
Extraordinarily gay. Steeped in gayness.
(upset) I *told* you the Drake was bad! I hate the Drake!
What? Elaine's big-head guy? They have you the apartment?!
(Looking over the writing materials they just bought) Bics? What, d'ja get, bics?
You can do better than me. You could throw a dart out the window and hit someone better than me. I'm no good!
(after waitress walks away) I don't believe it, she did it again!
Yeah, yeah, well, because of the cane. You should see the bathroom they gave me!
They got a billion people over there and he found a relative.
Alright, I'll tell you what you do. You call her back and give her the "it's me", heh? Pull the old switcheroo.
It's a calzone, sir.
"All right Jimmy Good talking to ya."
They are made from lycra-spandex.
It's like puberty that never stops. Ear puberty, nose puberty, knuckle puberty, you gotta be vigilent. Let me ask you this Do you know where Walker Street is downtown? I've got a league meeting there.
I should probably get going too. If I don't feed Pequita by seven, she goes all over everything.. take it easy.
You're making more than I am.
The guy never came back.
You know how easy it is for dead people to travel? Its not like getting on a bus. One second. (snaps his fingers) Its all mental.
Yes he is. Let me ask you something. When you come out of the shower and you put your robe on, do you cinch it real tight, are you concerned about that?
...I broke up with her.
Is it about me?
Please.
Jerry, did you hear that?
(sobbing) yodel lay hee hoo..
Where's the tamale guy?
Yeah. Yeah. It's the only way. Come on. What are you, kidding me?
I just thought it would be nice. A little variety.
(standing) Oh yeah, Reilly? (smugly) Well, the jerk store called. They're running outta you
Lights out.
Well if you and I ever got into, like a really serious fight you know, and the punches started flying -- who do you think would win?
She comes out of the bathroom, I'm in up to my wrist. You should have seen the look on her face.
He's getting on a bus, damn! (To the blind man) Those are nice glasses.
That's a good score.
I was doing standup comedy in Kennebunkport Maine. ??? night club. The stage was on a cliff and the audience was throwing all the comics off.
Pennypacker. Varnsen.
Are you crazy? You take your life in your hands with those nuts.
When are they gonna learn that any news about China is an instant page-turner? (seeing Jerry with a small black device) What's that?
Yes, I heard you!
Yea
K-I-M-B-R-O-U-G-H
What are you talking about? (Jerry grins) You're not!
Yes. Please. Please, let's go.
Jon Voight bit you?
De-compressing.
Im sorry, I dont see the big deal about being a matador. The bull charges, you move the cape, whats so hard?
Great! I ate the entire platter! Had to call in sick today.
This woman drove us out of our minds
If I could talk to the guy for just a sec...
Well ordinarily I wouldn't mind. But...
I'm not going if he's going.
Artie Schuman? From Camp Hatchapee?
Boy, she is nice. I like her, I like her Jerry. She's got substance. She oozes substance.
No. That's not that.
Jerry! Up here!
You're soured?
Well why don't you take off your hat and stay awhile.
It's in... transit.
She supports her whole family. (walking slowly into the room)
Really? How'd she do that?
How old's the son?
Elaine, I got to have another picture of Gillian.
Of course you do.
My little man's an idiot.
All right, I gotta make a call. Everybody out, come on.
I know. It's Mickey Mantle's number. So not only is it an all around beautiful name, it is also a living tribute.
(coming back in) Alright, alright. Can we go out and eat?
Maybe he's just "very well RED"?
(Thomassoulo helps George get up) Yeah, what the hell.
I am not putting it in a garage, it's my space.
[pause] Would I like to come up? I would love to come up. I, I'm fighting not to. Fighting! Unfortunately I uh have to get an early start tomorrow. Gotta' get up and hit that pavement
(Still on the hot water) What about shaving?
I got lost on the way over.
How engrossing?
Oh my god.
Oh! Modelling! What's that like? Fun? Ha ha. (to self in head) Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!
Let's test him. Hey, driver. What do you say we stop off, pick up your sister, have a little fun back here? No, he can't hear us.
This woman left this really sexy message on Jerry's tape recorder......
(Stops) Oh right, the blind date.
She is succinct.
ALL RIGHT!!
oh..
If only she could get fired. Is there any way that could happen? I mean I know how to get myself fired.
It's like I'm Neil Armstrong. I turn around for a sip of Tang and you jump out first.
Well, Jerry. There was a pretty good chance I was never gonna have sex again anyway.
Yes! Because it is the mature, adult thing to do.
Hi (raises his left hand in a slight gesture to say hi)
So uh where are the clothes?
Zing.
I DON'T KNOW. It's this place. I'm very uncomfortable here.
Do you realize in the entire history of western civilization no one has successfully accomplished the Roommate Switch? In the Middle Ages you could get locked up for even suggesting it!
Kramer...
I can't have an affair with a married woman, that's despicable!
You know, a muffin can be very filling.
Yes I'd like to speak to Marisa Tomei, please? Marisa, Hi it's George Costanza.. I'm the short, funny, quirky bald man you met a little while ago, heh! yeah I was just calling 'cos I wanted you to know that I'm not engaged anymore......well huh, She died....Toxic glue from the wedding invitations.....well we were expecting about two hundred people. Yeah... Anyway.. hum I got the funeral tomorrow but huh.. my weekend is pretty wide open and I was wondering... (dial tone interrupts George)..... Hello...Hello..
I love this place. You know, Carl and I come here all the time.
Let me ask you a question. Who would win in a fight between you and me?
I want you to find out is she likes me.
Can I say one thing to you? And I say this with an unblemished record of staunch heterosexuality.
I'm George. George Costanza, you live around here?
So Anyway, I started to compliment Elaine on her sketches and it turns out,they're Paula's.
Maybe I'll get her some jewelry.
A dry-cleaning bill?
what?.. that's ridiculous!
She might be leaving to work any minute.
(checking the fridge) No Chinese leftovers. George is gettin' suspicious.
All righty, no reason for us to uh, raise our voices.
I got nothing, Jerry. Nothing.
And here's a roll that I think you may enjoy.
Well, I think you should drop him down to Step Two.
Aaaa (looking around for Jerry) aaaa (finds Jerry) Ah ha. They had plans huh? They were busy. They were busy with their (doing a little dance to make the plans seem all that important) big plans!
(calling to Susan) Uh, ah, nothing. Nothing.
You sure?
Yeah, you know, what'd she uh, look like?
What $98.00?
Are there terrorists on the plane? A hotel fire. Is that it? Malaria? Yellow fever? Lupus? Is it Lupus?
That's it. That's the line... (squirts mustard into Jerry's coffee and stirs it) ...that destroyed my life.
Really?
Hey, look at this. This is the same massage chair we're gettin' for Joe Mayo, $60 cheaper.
Whew! Anybody see that poster in there? That is weird, wild stuff, huh? Whew!
Fabulous, I'll think about that George, thank you!
I'm as good as them.
I, uh, just think it's a little unusual. Two people to sit on one side...and leave the other side empty.
Boy, it stings.
I don't know how you can let this guy handle all your money.
(he thinks a little about it... and as he puts his hand on his knee and gets up) I'm sorry Karen. I know I care for you, but I just can't stand when someone doesn't like me. (he opens the door)
Tsst...'Course I have. Come on. My cousin's in a bubble. My friend Jeffrey's uh, sister, also ... bubble ... you know. I got a lot of bubble experience. Come on.
How do I get the hand?
Yeah, sure. I was showing a condo on 48th street. Besides, you think I wanna miss this? (chuckles)
And then you came here.
That is what Mr. Steinbrenner wants. He wants, everyone, ta, twirl around.
Time like what? I'm hungry. My stomach doesn't know that Kramer's wanted.
millions and millions
Well, some women like it.
Well, yeah.
...and then when I saw the photo I remembered where I'd seen him; the boom box incident.
All right. So, what theatre you wanna go to tonight? We got 61st and 3rd or 84th and Broadway.
No, I don't have it yet.
That was different!
What's the difference you just read it and mail it right back. These we'll do.
Yeah, anyway, she's uh, having some kind of a family lunch, I'll swing by after.
'Mickey'? (incredulous) 'Mickey'!
You schedule a late meeting.
(OC) It's George.
Well, personal, I mean, we both uh...
Little Rock, Arkensas.
Wait a minute, you were at a funeral, right?
How do you kn ow?
... Susan.
Okay, I guess I'll see you down there.
She said she liked me. No kiddin' she said that?
Really?
Jerry, you gotta talk to Sitarides.
Yeah, I would. It's just, you know, I just ate a whole pot roast.
You see, hu, ho ho.
Thank you.
And God didn't kill me.
So, Dad...
And I'm moving out of my parents' house, I'm taking that apartment on 86th street, remember the one we saw?
I couldn't. You know, if it's not about sports, I find it very hard to concentrate.
I'm sorry, Jerry I can't help you.
I cant believe what Im hearing.
Hello.
Oh, come on, you're good at this.
I love these people, you can't ask 'em questions. (getting excited) They're so mentally gifted that we mustn't disturb the delicate genius unless it's in the confines of an office. (worked up) When huge sums of money are involved, then the delicate genius can be disturbed!
Come on you're... uh... you're fine.
Ehh, You could get in trouble.
Now, fellas, fellas.. easy. You wouldn't want to beat up on one of your own.
Yeah.
So I really liked the pictures I picked up here yesterday.
Hot? (Feels Tartabull's material.) What is this?
What, you think I'm going to repeat the whole thing now?
Hey. I got Jon Voight's LeBaron. (Jingles the keys.)
Its called Sendrax. Theyve got some new kind of technique for televising opera.
Cmon, go for twenty-five hundred. Well do it together. Come on, come on. Were in it together.
Boy! What a story! I'm speechless. Speechless. I have no speech.
And why shouldn't you? Be fresh Stay fresh
(To Jerry) No, it's about nothing.
Well, he's merry.
Is this the ticket holders line, or the buyers?
You saw who, what?
Yes I suppose they are.
Oh.
Oh, I was trying to make a point.
I love when they touch your arm. I can't get enough of that. Why is that?
Well you see he slipped, and he landed on a kinda of a..
Oy uy uy.. (Antonio points to the sink) We really should get going.
Should I give you my keys, is that the transaction, trading keys...? Because Elaine has my keys.
I wont mope.
Yeah. (Noticing this makes him out to be the bad kid, he gets defensive) Well, I couldn't run over there the way I was!
I wonder if thats really true.
(shouts) Marisa Tomei!
(Even more nervous than before) Oh, the, uh, the cabin.. well, (Clears throat)
Yeah. Thanks. Hey, listen, if you ever get a date, maybe the four of us could go out together sometime.
I can't
Oh, there's a difference. It's subtle.
Sstill love. Still love.
(urgent) No! Check! (quieter) Please.
Oh, that's bad. That's bad.
(still quiet) Think, a second. You know, your friend was talking about me and, you know...
I can't tell anymore.
What?
Yeah, it's bizarre. (they both look around them suspiciously)
So, what's happening with the TV show? You come up with anything?
What, she's ranking you?
(Silently squinches his mouth and nods at Kramer)
Fine. Steal the battery. Now, all right, here is the Frogger. This is the front door, and this is the outlet.
It moved! It was imperceptible but I-I felt it.
Jerry said he didn't like it.
So?
(confused, to himself) Like me? But how?
Yeah, dentist of the stars.
I'm gonna read a book. From beginning to end. In that order.
Because if I watch it at my apartment I feel like I'm not doing anything. If I watch it here, I'm out of the house; I'm doing something.
Elaine's in love with the Wiz guy?
Oh, I dont get the enthusiastic hi, Im outta there.
Don't look around. Don't look around. That's what he wants.
All right, I'll ask her.
Yeah. (clears his throat) We should do this again.
What *kind* of a person are you?
No, don't call her.
But Mr. Cantwell, you... you owe me for the soup...
Aah, yeah, yeah. Won't you head on in, we'll be in in a second. Be right with you.
What are you gonna do?
Kramer, they like everybody. Theyre friendly people.
So?
Alright. Listen, I gotta get some reading done. You mind if I do this here? I can't concentrate in my apartment.
I can't eat this without catsup. Would it kill her to check up on us? Would that be a terrible thing? "How's everything? Do you need anything? What can I do for you?"
Come on, hurry up, old man! I'm an animal!
I'm telling you, skip the Drake's wedding, go to the game.
Kramer, what are you talking about...Janet doesn't look anything like Jerry
You met her at the supermarket? How did you do that?
Like a "Hey your mother is uglier than Hazel. Hazel really puts your mother to shame"
Ha, Yeah right, hang on, Ill ah, Ill get her for you. he, he, he, he. Seriously, what's up?
What big salad? I'm going to the coffee shop.
No I, I want it if you dont want it.
(to himself) That's what I'd like to know.
You want me to come back? Uh...
I told her I would have to think about it.
I never heard of that.
Let me show you something, take a look at this... (Another guy at the party interrupts.)
I was just curious.
No. I need a guy that can rig a Frogger machine so that I can move it without losing power, 'cause I have the high score. H-hello?
So, was it me?
Do you have something a little more... less expensive?
Medical journals!
Assistant to the travelling secretary. (fishing for a reaction) I'm uh, working on the project.
Ahh, Steinbrenner gave 'em to us, in honour of Phil Rizzuto being inducted into the Hall of Fame.
Yeah, yeah. You gotta come over tonight. We can play.
I had 'em, Jerry. They loved me.
Oh, thats great. Thats great. By the way I have to apologize for my friend the other day. Friend? Uh, uh I dont even know that woman. I met her on the bus on the way over. I couldnt get rid of her. Uh, My psychic instincts were a little off ..
Jerry, I'm trapped under my desk. Steinbrenner is in the room. You got to help[ me.
Yeah! That's how they talk. You know, everyone's either a bastard or a son of a bitch. Yeah, it's like uh..."boy, that son of a bitch Box can really hit, uh?!" (laughs)
Who is this Rava?
I walked.
Cinnamon? Why didn't cha get chocolate?
Oh, it's beautiful. It's in sports.
Who was flirting with you?
Maybe you said something that offended her.
All right. See you tomorrow. (George sighs, exits.)
I don't know what Newman wanted to see me for.
Pbbbs, Bubkis!
Live?
Well that was a really stupid thing! You know what's going to happen now?
It was an inferno in there! An inferno! (Eric, Robin's mother, and all the kids rush at George.)
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I used to come here all the time with my fiance, back when it was a meat-packing plant. Ha. Here's her picture. (hands her a magazine page)
(puzzled) W-we're not?
I just feel terrible This is just terrible.
Why don't they have salsa on the table?
I made him up.
Hey! (to Elaine, who doesn't look too cheerful)
I've got some plans. I got plans.
(Gestures for Kramer to shut up) Once again, Antonio, I can't even begin to say how deeply, deeply sorry I am about everything. The job, the cat.. (A lamp breaks) the lamp.
Yeah, of course she did. That's all I ever heard growing up is 'Why can't you be more like Lloyd Braun?' Did you know he was in a mental institution?
Ahhhhh...
(Definite) I'll take it in my room. (Walks off)
For a woman.
Why should I care?
What, you think I eat all my meals with you? (To waitress) Excuse me, sweetheart? I think you may have overcharged us. What is this?
(getting animated) Yeah. Yeah. You know the odds of me being anyone's type?! I have never been anyone's type, but apparently, this Marisa Tomei loves funny, quirky, bald men.
Ma, people can hear you.
'When you're alone, and life is making you lonely, you can always go...'
I just wanted to talk to him for a minute, but Ill come back.
Kramer!
I don't know, maybe a safe fell on her head.
Magellan? You like Magellan?
(double takes) What's that?
Next Friday, what time?
Yeah, about ten, fifteen minutes. But I have to stop at a vegetable stand.
Photo store Sheila.
Who wears a cape?
Well, if I hear you correctly--and I think that I do--my advice to you is to finish your meal, pay your check, leave here, and never mention this to anyone again.
Allright, I gotta head back right away, I'll-Ill -- I gotta figure something out here.
Uh, excuse me. (stopping them from rehearsing) Excuse me. (he walks to the guy's in charge of yelling "take #!") This--This is not right. May I? (the guy looks at George with a bothered face. George then walks up to Tom and takes him away from Jerry and Michael to talk to him in private)(to Tom) You see, you're going "They fooled *me* Jerry!" (George shakes his head with disapproval) You wanna hit 'fooled' more "They *fooled* me Jerry!". You see the difference?
(little subdued) Nakahama Broadcast Corporation.
Why?
Don't you see? I'm back in.
(entering the apartment more fully) Oh. Oh, hi, hi. Hi. Nice to meet you. (peering at the table) What're you having, veal?
Yeah. Hey, wait a second, you know, good news for you too. Susan's best friend, Hallie? Broke up with her boyfriend.
They never try anything.
Would they tune in?
Don't need it. N'huhuhu (laughs)
All right, Dad, we're five blocks from the house. Sit sideways.
Yeah. So what's going on? We're gonna shoot the pilot and then it's gonna be on TV the following week?
She's bald.
He uh...doesn't have any running water?
Yeah, the kind that Castro smoked. You can't buy ?em anywhere.
Well, what is that? That's a crime! Do you know how hot those things get? They should be wearing cotton.
I cheated in the contest.
hey
Too flashy?
Yeah, I may move out there. (getting 'yeah, right' glances from the Rosses) I mean it, I'll do it! OK, I'll see ya later. Keep it real!
No seriously...
Yes it is.
You told him? What did you tell him?
Oh, no, no, not at all. No, I have always felt that the most important thing in the world is spending time with family.
I'm starving. We should have had lunch first..
No, I-I-I know... [retreats back to his Chinese take out] I know...
You're kidding.
I gotta call Tatiana. where's the phone?
. . . she scooped her niblets?
Nah.
Because! Because, as the leader...if I die...then all hope is lost! Who would lead? The clown? Instead of castigating me, you should all be thanking me. What kind of a topsy-turvy world do we live in, where-where heroes are cast as villains? Brave men as cowards?
I can produce Keith Hernandez right here within the hour.
I just got fired.
What you talking about?
No. I did.
Oh!, so what. I'd rather she hate me and thought I was good looking....At least I can get somebody else. (scratching his chest) What is this? Why am I itching?
Mr Wilhelm? Wha..what're you doing here?
Revenge.
(singing) Master of the house/Doling out the charm/Ready with a handshake and an open...
What? You mean with a knife?
I tell you, I really don't think so-called relationship humor is what this show is all about.
No.
Chunnel ?
She's not there. She left. She must've waited and left because those people wouldn't get off the phone.
Well, if he can regift, why can't you degift?
Medium turkey chili.
Who?
My bag?
Something's up, there's something in the air.
(Changing subject) Hey, I htink I may have found someone for the scholarship.
What do think I tell Jerry everything? It's not like he's my wife.
I know, I know. Kind of a cute Nazi though.
(feigning excitement) Great, great. O-Oh, oh, oh, gosh. You know, it's just... my duties with the Yankees...
You're going that way anyway!
Oh, you might want to stick around Jerry. Mr. Thomassoulo picked the wrong man to hire because he was fake handicapped.
No, the cushion's turned over.
Well, I'm mentioning his name.
Thank you.
Wow! Heh. (Half kidding) You don't, huh, have a replacement lined up for me, do ya? heh he he he he he...
No, no, Hey I'll get it. What's in the BIG salad?
.....So what's your point?
Wish I could help you.
What about accommodations?
Did you explain to her about the good naked and the bad naked?
like that (looking at Jerry)
(excited) Did I tell you that story's relatable?! That was a great show! That is why I'm bringing it back to NBC.
Alright, now, how are we gonna monitor this thing?
I think. (Pause as they all look down)
Hey, I work for Kruger Industrial Smoothing "We don't care, and it shows."
So?
Wha - what happened? What are you doing back so soon?
They're not mocked and humiliated when they get to the other side.
How could you be a doctor and not say "get outta here"? It should be part of the training at medical school "Cancer? Get outta here!" "Go home! What are you crazy? It's a little test. It's nothing. You're a real nut. You know that?" (Jerry gives him half of his sandwich to hopefully shut him up) I told you that God would never let me be successful. I never should've written that pilot. Now the show will be a big hit, we'll make millions of dollars, and I'll be dead. Dead Jerry. Because of this. (showing his lip)
I have mourned for three long months! Summer months, too! Anybody could grieve in January! It's time for George to start being George again.
She must have slipped it in here.
Yeah, well, I guess the only thing I can do is go into George Steinbrenners office and tell him he has to give her a raise.
No, her too. And her mother.
Please.
(delighted!) Woooo!
Uh, let me ask you something. You uh, you ever hear of Marisa Tomei?
Alright, listen, I'll give you your spare keys, but I don't have them with me. Can I please have mine to give to back to Kramer?
Did you ever go to a singles weekend in the Poconos?
(walking back) Are you sure? 'Cause it could really help me out of a jam.
Hey. You know, do I have a case for you guys to do on L.A. Law.
I've seen squeeze mustard. I've never seen squeeze ketchup.
Yes, good to see you, too. And Good luck with, uh... with the whole thing, there.
Oh...uh, because if it had anything at all to do with what you perceived as me leering at your daughter, I really have to take issue with that. I did not leer. (To Jerry) Did I leer?
Pick it up, pick it up!
I can't believe, you're blaming Lupe?
(agitated) He's lying, sir! I'm tired of all your macho head games!
I know, but he's your son.
This is not a Metallica concert, it?s an opera alright, a little dignity, a little class, just give me my ticket, I will stand over here and sell it.
No, Can't be...For instance I remember when we first met, we had a great conversation.
Dolores!
Hey, the Bull owes me one, I helped him with his swing.
Oh, you hesitated.
Really? I never heard of a semi (the "i" sounds like an "e") tractor-trailer. (Jerry nods in agreement)
That wasn't a laser pen.
You see that woman on the horse? (points)
I though we said we weren't going to discuss that now!
It's supposed to be a good party.
Where's the remote phone?
(thoughtful) Yes. Yes.
(to the cab driver) Excuse me, do you see anything on my lip here?
Are the courses open?
Well I would eat you.
Would you like a chair?
Great move, telling him, by the way, real smart move.
He scratches off a 32 and he puts in 31.
Jerry, I can't talk to Jerry anymore. Ever since he moved into that apartment he's too much ... like you.
(Losing it) Don't tell me how to eat!
Could I, uh, could I trade you for another dollar?
Summer of '89 I'm at the beach. This family sits up next to me. I go in to the surfs and when I come from out, my clothes, my towel, my umbrella, they're all gone. I am furious, I start screaming to these kids demanding my stuff back and finally I lose it; I grab their boom box and I chuck it in to the ocean.
(Interested) I should!
What is this? The marble rye?
Okay.
And you're watching the fight at Jerry's?
"Quite a workout"? What did you say?
If we decide to go at it.
Wait a minute. I must have been winking down at the office. That's why Mr. Wilhelm was acting so mysteriouso.
What TV Guide?
(Laughs) Steven, nothing is higher than an architect.
Yeah.
(Very loud in the direction of a waiter) I'm gonna need a coffee here. Very hot! Boiling!
I figured you'd cruise. At least through the Spring.
What did I get the veggie burger for? You got a veggie burger, so I had to get the veggie burger, I'm allover crums...
So?
Maybe I am.
"George likes spicy chicken."
Oh, god. Look who's here.
We're on the Grand Central, there's no traffic.
No, you're crushing my sandwich.
What are you gonna do with all of them?
Will that be cash, or cheque?
Aw, Kramer, don't start...
I'm getting nothing.
And maybe we could go out and do something.
Kramer.
May I just use your bathroom for a moment?
That's where the Seinfeld's are moving. They got a great deal. Yep. You know what they got in Florida? Jai-Alai! You bet on the games, you clean up.
That I'm used to. (he leaves)
All right You really want to know?...It all started when she told met hat...she was the voice on your tape recorder.
Yeah, well, they're my socks!
Somebody did that?
Pretend you didn't know it was there. Can you see it?
Gary? Well, well, well well. Where the hell've you been? I've been leaving you phone messages for months.
Oh oh oh, all right, fine, Jerry, you win. Take it, just take it!
Jerry, let me tell you something, "A man without hand is not a man." I got so much hand I'm coming out of my gloves. I got to thank Kramer.
What kind of a sick person would do a thing like that?
You only think that because you know me.
How ya doin'?
He's actually doing him a favor. It's less money for him to buy food.
I thought you said he was gonna get a muffin.
I still have it. The collar's okay. I wear it under sweaters.
Oh leave Jack alone. Jack's got enough problems. I'll just take the small office.
Jerry drinks Morning Thunder?
(surprised) So, I'm Neil? How did I do that?
Heh heh heh hey, new suit (raises coffee cup as a salute / toast)
No.
More wine and turkey? (Pours Celia more wine)
Instinct.
Oh, these are my friends, Elaine and Jerry, ... Noel
(resentfully dampened) It's not a prom. It's a Ball.
(doing the voice) Im slippery as an eel
You didnt say "junior".
I don't understand things were going so great. What happened? Something must have happened.
Well, all vacations have to end eventually.
I don't want it to feel good.
Alright, alright, I'll go on the date, but that's that.
There you go.
Hey, hey! We're discussing something!
It just does.
Uh, Elaine, this is, uh, Lloyd.
I'll tell you what. Why don't we just get a couple of dishes and we'll just share 'em.
What, a 'little' cologne.
Yes she is. It's a pity we won't be seeing much more of her.
This is not good. This is not good.
This thing can't hurt me, can it? I mean, it is a laser. What if it hits my eye?
Well I am. Couldn't you try to go through some of that stuff I put in your shoebox?
Tell me.
What about you and Elaine?
Yeah, huh.
See, look at this. (wearing a very tight shirt) Rachel, my T-shirt shrunk. It used to be much bigger, and now it shrunk. You see, that's what water does. It shrinks things.
Very nice
you said "step off"? wow, that is too much hey..huh hey (George turns the cap his wearing backwards like Tony) Tony, I huh, I just had this brainstorm for us. Can you guess what it is?
W-What? What?
You are?
"George would never do anything like that."
Nooooooo......
(Holding his drink up to his mouth) Oh my gosh, I just had a great idea. She could come to the party tomorrow and read Gwen's lips for me.
You know this whole thing never would have happened if you hadn't bailed out on me at the restaurant.
Shall we say an hour.
(to Carrie) It's just that, I know her, and boy...
I know the D is the biggest. I've based my whole life on knowing that the D is the biggest.
Shut up! Shut up!
You know what word Susan used last night? Hnuh. Vault! hu,
what are you doing here?
I remember.. (Leaves)
It was more like a full bodied dry heave set to music.
Your buttocks are spectacular.
Aw, well, you know, it's your anniversary. It's - it's the least I can do. I - I just want you guys to go out and have a good time. Ha ha. So, you think we should, uh, we should get downstairs?
(still on the phone) All right fine.... Whatever
Uh, uh, yeah. Actually, the, uh, I-I bumped my elbow on a desk and uh injured something an.. now it sort of moves involuntarily.
Feel? What's that?
Never! It is a part of me. I will just return the chair, and it will be easy, because the receipt is in my good friend.
Are.. are you okay?
What?
Let's see, How I'm very good at going in reverse in my car, why isn't Postum a more popular drink,
(disbelief) What? (laugh) Wh... what're you talking about? I'm not the one with the problem. (defensive) Lloyd Braun was in the nuthouse, not me.
Yeah, Jimmy why don't you wait outside, you know, play with something.
What do you think? The brought it over in pieces and screwed it together like a coffee table?
And who's responsible for making hate mongering and fascism popular again?
yeah.. the ambulance got there very quickly
Well if you didn't think I was parking, why did you put it in head first?
You know, you go out, you get another rye. Of course, it would have to be the same one from Schnitzer's. You put it in the kitchen somewhere and you say Ohh! There it is.
Nah.
How much was it?
Lemme tell you something, that Jerry Lewis? You wonder how some of these people get to the top? It's ideas like this! Brilliant! Hah-hah! (Notices that the briefcase is damaged.) Look at this - what the hell happened? The whole side is damaged here...and the lock is broken.
I had the perfect situation here, he was shouldering half the load.
Yes.
Why?
Yes, well you see, the deceased landed on my car. The uh splat, as it were, actually occurred on the roof of my car. Now of course I can't help but feel that had it been a convertible this whole tragedy might have been averted but I've never been the kind of guy to buy a convertible, what with the baldness and everything.
(Scoffs) ARe you kidding? Lincoln Center. Alice Tully Hall, the Met. Magnificent facilities.
What, are you crazy? I can't have a man touching me. Switch with me.
What are they doin' lettin' you bastards on an airplane? Don't they know that's against FAA regulation?
Now, this is the basic layout for Mario's Pizza.
Women like skiers.
All right, I've got to go down to the unemployment office. Wanna take a walk?
Well then...then you really have something to think about because.....you know if there's any doubt in your mind ....and.. and,, it doesn't even have to be a big doubt, you know even a tiny doubt, a DOT of a doubt.. and.....
Once, to a dog. He licked himself and left the room.
(Nervous) What are you talking about?
Anyway, again, I'm sorry about throwing you out of the car.
Yes, it was very, very good.
Yeah, he's in my bed. I'm sleeping on the couch.
I know, I know...don't skimp. Go go go go...
Not even an apple.
She's still doing that?
Natalie?
People are looking for tickets here?
What?
Huh. Your renting a house in Tuscany?
Hey, I'm sorry, you had your buffer zone for many years. It's my turn to live, baby.
This is totally different! That was my secret, this is Jerry's secret! There's...there's attorney-client priveleges here! If I play it by your rule, no one'll ever confide in me again, I'll be cut out of the loop!
Oh, my God.. (Buries his face into his hands)
Ah! Some bald thing, a bald thing I dunno. It's nothing
Yeah.
Isn't it?
Claire, Claire, youre a woman, right?
I'm not getting on a regular plane now - I'm all psyched up to go on a private jet. No way I'm getting on a regular plane.
I'm interviewing all these annoying little overachievers.. finally, this kid walks in - Steven Koren - a regular guy.. likes sports.. watches T.V..
Story.
What?
Yeah, people who work at NORAD, whore on twenty-four hour missile watch. Everything was going along so great. She was laughing, I was funny... I kept saying to myself, Keep it up, dont blow it, youre doing great.
Sure, all right, what do you want?
--and this is Kramer.
Just need to uh, to dig 'em up.
Murphy Brown, the TV show.
"All right, I'll see you guys later."
Beautiful lineswoman. Alright listen uh I'm going to go to the concession stand and get some real sunblock. You want anything? Jerry? (Jerry is staring at the lineswoman) Jerry?
I'll tell you what I'd like to do. I'd like to replace that rye.
Oh! Great!
All right, I want you to do me a favor.
(still puffing)" Whoa!!"
(Ironing) You don't wanna know.
Well, if she was a criminal and you had to describe her to a police sketch artist...
Of course I do.
what rock?
I think those are my socks!
I told ya. Hey, any of you guys want to come out and help me fix my father's screen door in Queens?
What?
Yeah?
Well(coughs) I can't stop now...(coughs) I'm addicted...
(mutters it again)
Hehehe. .(feebly)
Ya and also I'm afraid that people in that state are finally going to tell me what they really think of me. You know they got nothing to lose what do they care?
Should I not go on this trip?
I agreed to become his butler.
Thanks again for last night!
How could you do that?
What are you? Satan? I'm close to a job here. It's my second interview with them.
I think something's happening here.
Clara Barton? What did she do?
All right. That's more like it. Thank you very much. (giving the sponsor the 'be strong' hand clench) By the way, my uncle was an alcoholic, so...
Hey, look, Kramer,
alright alright, I gotta buy some bread
Puddys just gonna give you the car, huh? (Skeptically) Youll see. First they stick you with the undercoating, rust-proofing, dealer prep. Suddenly, youre on your back like a turtle.
You met her a few weeks ago, but...?
Mr Reichman?
Pick up the phone, Elaine. Pick it up!
Okay, all right, all right.
What are you talking about, that's seventy-five bucks! I'm not working, I can't afford that.
(again from bathroom) Witness.
Marsala?
Maybe I'll just meet you there.
Yeah, he's something, isn't he?
It's George.
You paying my hotel and airfare to Miami?
Maybe the baby would like to see my spot. A positive, uplifting message to start his life out with. Huh, You can still get a great space in this city - if you apply yourself.
Well I spoke to Elaine...
I read somewhere that this Brentano's is the place to meet girls in New York.
I will, sir. Top priority.
Oh - I've got something.
I'm serious.
What does the chaperone do?
Just do it like a Band-Aid. One motion. Right off! (beat) She is sexy though. Dont you think?
Yeah! Yeah!..Staten Island . What about my clothes ,how do I get the rest of the clothes?
No.
A cup of coffee. That, that doesn't mean anything.
No kidding?
Hey, wanna get some lunch?
Yeah, me either.
Well, that's.. Elaine!
What for?
(Frantic) Kramer, do you know what those guys are gonna do to me?!
Yeah, I think I got a touch of something, too.
I think I'll have a piece of cake.
What was wrong with that sorry? It was a good sorry. Jerry, was that a good sorry?
I would give anything to be going up those stairs again.
Yeah, you're just so... hip.
For a mental patient. Wait a minute, the phone, we'll call the police.
No. I am not giving my code to anyone for any reason.
Jerry?
What game?
I dont know. I cant believe theyre making me take this test.
(to Jerry) What do you mean by that?
But I mean look at him. He's gotta be on his feet like that all day? That's brutal. I think I'm gonna say something to your uncle.
(Gets up to leave) Well, scintillating as always.
a piece?
Well, you know Katy, Elaine's friend?
Jerry? Jerry can you hear me?
Here, just give me a couple of napkins.
So call her up and tell her to bring you another one. She'll be delighted to talk to you.
She wants to talk to you.
??? KNOCK OFFS. I NOT GOING TO DO IT! AND YOU'RE GOING TO CALL STEINBRENNER BACK AND CANCEL THE WHOLE THING.
Yeah.
Latvia?
So Dad,--
What kind of operation is it?
You're not going to get back here in time!
Monica, I'm really focused here, this stuff's a killer. (turns to the next page)
I know.
I was going to, but then I found out that the auto club has this free locksmith service, so I signed up. Just waiting for the membership to kick in.
Well, it's about Holly Go-Lightly.
Huh. You must think Im pretty stupid. (The mechanic shoots him a look as if he cleary does think hes stupid) That was no 5th Avenue bar. I can see the crumb right there in the corner of your lip! Now, that-that-that is a cookie - and we all know that Twix is the only candy bar with the cookie crunch.
I'll see you guys later.
You know what? it's better than Elaine's, too. I gotta give her a call. (Moves tward the phone)
The uniforms! Did you see how they played? Listen to these comments! (reads from the paper) "Wade Boggs 'What a fabric! Finally we can breathe.' Luis Palonia 'Cotton is king.' Paul O'Neill 'I never dreamed anything could be so soft and fluffy.' "
Yes.
You won't regret this, sir.
Oh, no. We left on good terms.
I-I don't know. Last time I got the tap.
I didn't have any sex.
The song?
(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o. (Hes sitting on the floor in his Play Now office).
Yeah.. yeah, we're - we're cool. (Knocks lightly. Kramer takes charge by knocking on the door louder. The busboy answers) Uh, I'm sorry to bother you, I was in the restaurant earlier and I was wondering if I could talk to you for a few minutes about what happened. (He gestures for them to come in. They obey) I hope I'm not interrupting anything. It's just that I think I may have - without realizing it - been responsible for getting you fired. (Nervously laughs) And.. and.. and I just want you to know that I didn't intend for that to happen.
Really? Because people do meet in places besides a bar, huh?
(to Jerry) He collects them.
There you go.
Yeah, what do you do when you run out of laundry?
Ha! (grabs his coat and exits the apartment)
My moneys all tied up in change right now.
Again with the Rava.
The better looking they are, the faster they go! I mean, I see they out there on the street, they're zooming around, like a blur. Like they have a motor on their ass.
(waving apologetically) Not you.
We're straightening out!
Thank God that's over.
You're an alcoholic! You have to apologize. Step Nine! Step Nine.
A man gave me... a massage. hu, hu
Really?
You're going to the Tony's?
No.
(incredulous) I look just like him. I. Me. (flings his arms out) This! This is what her boyfriend looks like. How is that possible?
So are you going to Todd's party this weekend?
Lemme tell you sum'in. When Ponce looked in that mirror and saw that he hadn't changed, and that tear started to roll down his cheek? ... I lost it.
(unenthusiastic) Congratulations.
Hey, Lainey, wanna see the horsey?
Well then, from out of nowhere, a huge tidal wave lifted me, tossed like a cork and I found myself right on top of him, (ELAINE gasps quietly Ahhhh) face to face with the blow-hole. I-I, I could barely see from the waves crashing down upon me but, I knew something was there so I reached my hand in, felt around and pulled out the obstruction!
What's with all the butter?
Of course, the uh, the four passes. (closes partition) Four passes to Madison Square Garden? Wait a minute. Wait a minute! Of course! Chicago! The Knicks are playing the Bulls tonight!
Hnn! Let me see that.
Oh now you're gonna go? ELAINE I'll be back in five minutes.
What could I do?! We fooled around and went to a movie!
Alright, c'mon, scooch over. (Tries to squeeze into the corner seat of the couch and struggles with Remy. He spills his glass of grape juice all over the couch in the process.)
Yeah, I better grab some too.
Alright so you made out with someone.
Nose. (chuckles) What's the worst that can happen to a nose? What does it get? Stuffed? (chuckles)
You didn't get one?
Well, no.
No.
(Angry) Yeah, that's what they told me the last time.
Know him? Would you, uh, like to meet him?
(together -- with arms extended -- palms upwards) Stan The Caddy.
(worked up) Because if she gets it back, then you'll have no reason to be sour. You'll de-sour, right?
Yes, yes, but uh, I have to make a call, so...
Oh I was not. The BUBBLE BOY was tried to kill me.
I don't know. I don't think you're anything.
Yes, they are bold. Jerry, what do you think?
So, you were saying how, um...about the script...
Hey.
When I hear her name mentioned.
Well, you're gonna have to go to the bathroom!
What? Nothing.
What kind of a therapist are you? I'm telling I'm scared that something terrible is gonna happen to me, right away you start looking for tumors?
It's "ooh" As in "ooh ooh ah ah."
Eh, there's that woman that never talks to anybody.
Ahh, Ah-AhWe had a deal!
You have any idea how fast these things deteriorate when there's an 'I love you' out of the bag? You can't have a relationship where one person says, "I love you", and the other says, "I'm hungry. Let's get something to eat.".
I just don't feel like it anymore.
Eh, don't mention it.
You don't think you can buy the ticket yourself...? No, there, there...you sit, and I'll purchase the ticket for you.
I need like a bucket of water! I got a car overheating, I got an alarm that won't go off, I'm pressing 'one', I'm pressing 'two', nothing! What do I do?! Help me! Help me!
It is too!
No they don't. I tried that once. I snubbed for a year. Nothing. Every woman I saw, I snubbed. You never saw people so pleased. (Elaine returns from the bathroom.)
I think that's one of mine.
You don't need the cufflinks! You have the same name! (no reaction) 'Jerry'! (heads for door, grabbing his coat)
I was just blowin' off a little steam. So what?
No. No way.
I can't believe this is happening.
Can't find them. That's marvelous. The dance continues.
He's actually doing him a favor. It's less money for him to buy food.
Ok, fine. It's going to be very interesting, very interesting if they don't show up tonight. You know my mother made all this Paella.
I eh, I had a sandwich in my pocket.
When did you leave the message?
It is a horrible company. There's no management what so ever. I could go hog wild in there.
Your idea?
Are, are you sure this is decaf? Wheres the orange indicator?
. . . naw, it's just you thanked HER, and and oh, . . . what's the difference?
Well, it's just, all you said was 'your welcome', which is nice. It's very nice. But... I feel I gotta get the apology.
(angrily) Oh you mother...
It's like you're livin' in the Playboy Mansion! Did she, uh, did she frolic?
(Putting his hands up) Alright, alright, hold on! (Jerry has George's full attention) Time out! Woah, woah! (Scooting in, giddy) What did she say?
(from the intercom) Yeah.
Well I guess that's because I wear boxer shorts.
Why didn't you just wear a heavier coat?
Thanks.
Here's the TV. I know you wanted to watch the Super Bowl. Do you at least have some towels we could sit on? It's, like, a four hour game.
horning on my rock climbing trip. It's just supposed to be me and Tony
Yeah.
I'm excited about the pouty.
I called it.
Yes, now. It's gonna take a few days and my parents are gonna be back. I gotta have it back before them!
And now for the trifecta. (Picks up a hand held TV and gets back under the covers.)
By the way, have you spoken to Elaine yet today?
(Definite) Oh yeah.
I'm sorry I missed it.
Huh, nggh [snort] Stop. (flirting with her he playfully hits her arm with the menu, then flicks it into the air)
What's Yo-yo Ma?
This was supposed to be 'The summer of George'! The summer of George.
Yeah, that's right. It's working.
Yeah. You could base a character on me.
The car!
(shaking hands with Morty) Morty, always a pleasure.
These are not "scraps." These are historic remains of a once Great Society of Hair.
Nothing.
Well, wait a little while, Ma. What's the difference?
Liam Neeson. You know, he's not American.
Kramer, she's a model.
I suppose I could just pull this out ( his tucked shirt)and walk around like this and you wouldn't care?
Because... you know...
I saw Siena again.
So it was my comment that broke them up?
I show up. I pretend I have the job. The guy's on vacation. If I have the job, it's fine. If I don't have the job, by the time he comes back, I'm ensconced.
Well, I have to see her.
Hey, you know, there's this secretary at work that always had a crush on me.
I dont understand.
What is that?
(surprise) Head of scouting?
Yes, sir, that was a good sandwich, sir.
Where the hell is your father?!
All names sound strange the first time you hear 'em. What, you telling me people loved the name Blanche the first time they heard it?
What'd you do today, dad?
Guys, hitting is not about muscle. It's simple physics. Calculate the velocity, v, in relation to the trajectory, t, in which g, gravity, of course remains a constant. (Hits a home run) It's not complicated.
Yea, ya..ya know I feel terrible about Joey but it's jus..it's a great business opportunity. I-I don't even know how long I'm gonna be away for.
Well you missed a lovely little party that we had for Grace.
(CONT'D) ...with that group.
Yeah?
Did you get the shot?
Yeah, him.
Heh, haa. And that's no good. I've tried it straight, Jerry. We've all seen the results. For me, sick is the only way to go.
He stole your girlfriend?
Good for you.
Well say were frightened and we have to go home.
I mean, it's not fair. I've been going there for 7 years. She's been there 3 weeks.
Hello?
I can't. I gotta make the weekly call to the folks.
The attic? Y-you haven't wore any of those clothes for years.
Why is what I do is so important? Why must I be always the focal point of attention? Let me just be, let me live.
He's a jerk. (nudges to his right but no one is there)
What about me? I was a total failure. Everything was fine. Now this thing's gonna be a success and God's gonna give me a terminal disease.
What is Borax?
Where the hell is this car, Kramer?
What hat?
(ON PHONE) It's a '76 Chevy Impala. They stole it right in front of the hospital. I saw the guy drive off in it. Well he's about five feet tall, hairless, pink complexion.. (Elaine puts her finger on her nose) looks like a pig. Yeah, alright alright, thank you, thank you. (Kramer enters) So any word from the "pig-man"?
(joyful) June. It's June.
Kind of.
(laughs) Yeah, it's me. Is this Clayton?
Great, great. So anytime you want you can just visualize her naked.
No I didn't mean to imply that you did. You're obviously a very well proportioned individual. I was just wondering, have they ever offered you a chair?
Ahh, Excuse me, how much is this?
How do you know?
(broaching a subject) Hey mom. What kind of woman was grandma?
And I cancelled plans to go to the movies with them tonight.
(crestfallen) But you said it was my call.
The Frogger is here.
(Standing up) I just got here, Ma! I'd like to spend a little time with you.
There was an incident. I'd rather not discuss it.
(he thinks) I think the hats. The hat conveys that solemn religious look you want in a faith. Very pious.
No, impossible! Its your apartment.
"Why would George steal from the Yankees?"
And there's you ticket.
I-I'm already here. I'm here. I'm here. Uh, you know what? If you want a computer, call me. I-I gotta go.
I'll have the Clams Casino.
Uh, it's only a matter of time.
Already you're marrying this guy?
The rule is a minimum of two days.
Did you see what just happened?
I, I couldn't help but notice that uh you don't have a chair.
Yes. And listen to this, listen to this; her uncle works for the Yankees and he's gonna get me a job interview. A front office kind of thing. Assistant to the traveling secretary. A job with the New York Yankees! This has been the dream of my life ever since I was a child, and it's all happening because I'm completely ignoring every urge towards common sense and good judgment I have had. This is no longer just some crazy notion. Elaine, Jerry, this is my religion.
Well, I still think you shoulda told me.
(still worried) He was pretty emphatic?
All right Mrs. S. I and my good pal Keith Hernandez will be right back.
Should I take some?
(Fake sympathy) Well, my mother, Jerry..
(embarrassed with a touch of unrestrained jubilation) Yes.
I can't perform under pressure. That's why I never play anything for money, I choke. I could choke tonight. And she works in my office, can you imagine? She goes around telling everyone what happened? Maybe I should cancel, I have a very bad feeling about this.
That's what I wanna know.
They say this guy's the best.
(pointing to Jerry in joyous agreement) Ha-ha-hah. This is my lucky day.
Oh, n-no comparison.
Uh, about two hundred dollars, Miss DeMooney.
I know it's a doll, but it looks like my mother!
Pardon?
Ha Ho! (he turns and walks out the door)
Not that much. You know, they tend to shrink in the water.
This is a huge project involving lots of numbers and papers and folders.
When are they leaving for Paris?
I mean you're just, you're just a marvel of organization.
It's not that I want to keep talking about it? just think that the subject should resolve itself based on its own momentum.
Uh, Rick..
Who's going to bomb you. An airline for all the stupid little peanut jokes.
(laughs) Youd have to be a real loser to try something like that.
We have to discuss my alibi.
Well, I got just the thing to cheer you up. A computer! Huh? We can check porn, and stock quotes.
No, there'll be girls there.
She knows there is nothing to talk about.
You arms look like something hanging in a kosher deli.
With the orange hair, and the big clown shirt with the ruffles...
You know, I'm sorry, I...I hate to be one of those people, but we're right in the middle of this thing...I can't hear.
So long, Mr. Farkus.
I was trying to stick the landing. (indistinct) ...was right around here.
Oh, uh...
look at this guy. Does he have to stretch in here?
I, I think I made my point. I'm sorry if I was a little harsh.
Yes, I will do the opposite. I used to sit here and do nothing, and regret it for the rest of the day, so now I will do the opposite, and I will do something!
I think I like the girl better than the voice.
Ripe. Boy, this Joe's got some terrific fruit.
[to himself] Oh, my God! It's Susan! What do I do?
(sitting) So, guess where Mr 'Ocean phoned' turned up? He's working for Firestone, in Akron, Ohio.
Where did you get those socks?
Why, the color?
Yes, I, uh, I need to return this book.
Yeah, yeah, right here. (hands it to him)
Of course I mean that. I am incapable of guile.
Finicky? Prissy? Fastidious?
Let me be the architect! I can do it!
Yeah. (George hands over the prescription) Kramer...
Ok, so, what'dya got?
(continuing) I feel like a family. In fact, yesterday was Grace's birthday. She's such a sweet woman so, we had a little party, with cake and champagne. I made a toast.
Oh I got it. (TO JERRY) That I'm supposed to remember. Where the car is, that's insignificant.
My whole life is ruined because of the (Mocking, bitter tone) "puffy shirt".
What about the body, what kind of body?
Where are you going?
$2? But everyone in front of me got free bread.
It's just not good, it's not good.
(Muttering) No, that's it.
Who?
Hey, you gotta take a ride with me later. I borrowed my father's car. '68 GTO.
They way he just says stuff.
You?
My credit card?
Alright, alright!
I told her I was out o' soda, I went out to get some, an' I never went back.
There must be some way to find out.
Ade, I have to tell you, I, I have never met anybody so ... efficient.
I wouldnt think so.
Jerry ... Where are you? I know you like to sit back here. Elaine! Susan!
We got a deal.
(interrupts her) You know what. I don't think I'm going to be able to stay over tonight.
Elaine?
What do you think I mean bald? Bald. Bald bald.
Well what if she calls me? What am I supposed to say?! (hand hits the table)
By the way, you owe me seven fifty.
(light) No. No, no, no. The cushion was turned over.
Uh, yes, uh...you don't know me, my name is George Costanza...did you happen to rent Breakfast At Tiffany's?
Without his shirt on.
These fries are really really good...
You like that?
Maybe hes resting.
alright alright
Why not?
Hey.
Is he a clown? What, are you kidding me!?
(leaving) Alright that's it for me. Good night everybody.
(angry undertone) Oh, I'm gonna give you a Royal bearing. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Lemme get a pack of gum here.
Will you shut up?!
Important step. Maybe the most important.
Mom and Pop Seinfeld
(thoughtful) Breakdown, huh?
So, what're you saying?
It's my head!
Well, I'm gonna go back there later and return it when there's different people working.. You want to catch a movie?
Ah-ha!
What are you repeating everything I'm saying?
What do you mean?
"Hey you know , I felt we had like a synergy out there,you know, like we were really helping each other."
Phew!
The dentist thing?
That's allowed? You're allowed to postpone it?
(uncomfortablly) Thank you.
Dad.
I had a job interview.
Oh. Oh!
Mulva! (again pointing finger at Jerry -- Kramer watches the exchange back and forth)
Yes!
This hat just bottles in the heat, I -I don't even need a coat! It's unbelievable!
If Elaine wanted to get some coffee.
...he embibed her glistening spell...just before the other shoe...fell.
Water coolers?
All right.........I've become attracted to Elaine..
What come on? Have you ever dated a woman that worked in your office?
Hehummm , Yeah!
I know, but don't say anything to anyone. He told me not to tell you.
(on the answering machine) Jerry, it's George. Hey, hey are you all set for the weekend. This is going to be great. You're going to have a great time with Naomi.
Eh eh eh, can't do it, can't do it, sorry, I got a date.
What is with this family?
They all have swirling chocolate in the commercial!
I froze. I think I'm losing it.
That's cute.
Oh no, I am down!
Just inch over. You worm your way.
Because, Jerry, it's a couple rule! We have to tell each other everything!
Is that how you're gonna say it?
Well, it's kind of a mystery, isn't it?
(pondering) Yes I suppose they do.
The cashier is at lunch - which is where Id like to be.
They refuse to put cucumber in the salad. I need cucumber.
I got about fifty-feet out and suddenly, the great beast appeared before me. I tell ya he was ten stories high if he was a foot. As if sensing my presence he let out a great bellow. I said, "Easy big fella!" And then, as I watched him struggling I realized, that something was obstructing its breathing. From where I was standing I could see directly into the eye of the great fish!
Can you believe he sold his glasses on the street?
Behind the dugout, are you kidding? How did you get them?
Well, it was slightly used...
Well do you want me to take it off?
As you care for me. Which is why it is very important that you never breathe a word of this to anyone about the... you know. What, with Clarence Thomas and everything.
That's where the electricity comes out.
All right, look--wait--wait--Krama--wait, wait a minute, you are not. You are not goin' in. Ah-ahhh!
Did you see the homeless guy on the library steps screaming obsenities and doing some calesthetics routine
You yearn.
S-s-somebody double parked, we couldn't help it. It might have been Saddam Hussein, we're not really sure. He eh, had a British accent though.
Psh. What's the point of even discussing it? [condescendingly takes her hand and pats it] You'll give me the money when you have it. [takes two steps, then reconsiders, then re-reconsiders] I, I trust you.
To the hospital.
All right, listen, I'll see you guys later.
Oh. It's just horse manure (huh huh - laughs, he points back at the horse that walked by) Horse manure's not that bad. I don't even mind the word manure. You know, it's, it's nure, which is good. and a ma in front of it. MA-NURE. I mean when you consider the other choices, manure is actually pretty refreshing.
That's right.
Dad, it's me. Hey, listen, I was at Fortunoff's the other day, and, you know what, you were right.
I can't believe she got involved with a shrink.
Apply for a job? What for?
(gets up and picks a mirror) Yes. Yes, it's white. Why it's white.
You don't listen when people talk to you anymore!
Hey, people, people, people, people, people. Not bad, huh? Excuse me.
How do you suppose they did that?
(angry) Stickin' it!
La-la-la-la-la-la-la! [flashbacks to Susan]
No, you see? You got greedy.
I gotta stay one step ahead of Neil.
Yes, it is consistent. I've, uh, I've tried to maintain a consistent feel throughout the house.
You remember the woman on the horse? She wanted my spot.
What did she say?
Yeah, what is he? Some sort of an instigator?
Awright, I'll see you later.
Did you say dangerous?
Yes.
Alright, now you're gonna see some parallel parking. (spitting into his hands and rubbing them together) How I wish you could make a living parallel parking. (turning around in his seat) It's all geometry, knowing all the angles, when to make that first turn and then when to swing it back in, that's the key.
This is very exciting. The inner sanctum.
(Irritated) It's called a T-square.
C'mon Jerry, let's go. What was that all about?
You do.
Psst, You're telling me.
What do you mean, I got? You didn't give him his Visa application.
(singing)  Master of the house/Keeper of the inn... (Jerry re-enters the living room and modestly models his new jacket for George. George is impressed.) This is huge! When did this happen?
FDR?
[pause] Tonight?
Hey by the way my parents really want to have your parents over dinner before they leave town.
Yes, Mr. Hayman
Hey, there's a guy up the roof.
Well, it's a funny idea.
Anyway, right in the middle, the ship blows up-- burning debris, bodies falling-- and then just as this eerie silence settles over the airfield, I yelled out, "That's gotta hurt!"
Hey, what happened with Sandy. I forgot all about it. Did you call her?
Ahoy! Mr. Eldridge. I understand you were on the Andrea Doria.
Alright, we're back in!
I think Im getting tired of it. I mean is that all it does? Hello? La-la-la?
Yeah-hah!
I can't believe I get paid for this.
There's no G-bone.
Ma?!
You're you.
Okay, go ahead.
When I asked him if it was cancer, he didn't give me a "get outta here". That's what I wanted to hear "Cancer? Get outta here?"
(from bathroom) VANDELAY, SAY VANDEL... (George falls) ... Vandelay Industries, ...
(Motioning toward waitress) I think she likes me.
This is it?
No no no, that's in the right position.
I won't be able to, concentrate in front of you.
Hamstring.
What do you mean?
(very casual and raising his hand in the air) Yep. That's five!
No... What guy?
Excuse me. Is this, uh, Rage-aholics?
This isn't going well.
Yeah.
How can you just get it?
(Annoyed) There's more.
Does that mean I have to go too?
No, not a racial thing, there really is a resemblance...
Well... (shuts door) heeere we are (puts down his coat and chuckles)
Those birthdays. I told you. They're relationship killers. If a relationship is having any problems whatsoever, a birthday will always bring it out.
It's a performance, Jerry. Like what you do.
What do they say?
(snaps fingers) There you go.
Well, wha-what about the toe? What happened to the toe?
Well was it a woman?
You heard the man. I guess you gotta be moving your car.
I told them I have a place in the Hamptons. What did you say?
Were having lunch with a friend. He works in the building.
Well how could you just play your message in front of anybody?
Where'd you meet her?
And ah, Ill have the bacon club without the turkey. (raises eyebrows)
Right here. (showing his lip)
Mrs. Sweedler thank you. Y-You see, this tragedy affected me in a very, very personal way.
It's break up by association. Besides, she's mad at me anyway because of my birthday present.
Lowes Paragon, 84th and Broadway.
Pay phone in L.A., look it's a miracle.
All right, that's enough. I gotta go home and take a nap.
It's a spanish dish. It's a moulage of fish, an meat with rice. Very tasty.
oh, . . .because she handed you the bag. I could have handed you the bag. She happened to pick it up at the restaurant even though, . . .
I noticed you eh, chose the eh "clowns with balloons" check design.
Yes, yes! The punishment should fit the crime.
I can't to myself. I'm exhausted.
Oh. I know they have some monies.
Let's do it.
Let me just see it for a second.
Not really. Your voice kind of raises to this comedic pitch. (Kramer enters)
La-la Land. I got the window seat, right?
Your parents'll never let you do it.
Do you hold the neck together with one hand, or are you just letting it flap in the breeze?
All right we got the wine. Aren't we lucky? We got wine. Whoopee Whoa! Imagine if we didn't bring the wine. We'd be shunned by society. Outcasts! WHERE'S YOUR WINE? GET OUT!
But your life is Peterman's. Now the bus tour, which is real, takes to places that, while they are real, they are not real in sense that they did not *really* happen to the *real* Peterman which is you.
Seemingly. Seemingly. But within that basic framework there are many subtle variations, only discernable to an acute observer, that reflect the many moods, the many shades, the many sides of George Costanza.
Oh, it's good.
I'm trying to buy some of the clothes back. (realizing something) Hey you wanna come over for dinner tonight? My mother made all this extra Paella.
Give me the phone!
I'm not her boyfriend. I want to be her boyfriend.
Oh, you do?
Oh, I, uh, I disagree. You've, uh, you've been living in America too long. (indicates the bag of oranges) You've forgotten what it's like to have no oranges.
Why you going home for?
What, are you locking the door now?
What are you comparing yourself to Keith Hernandez. The guys a baseball player Jerry, Baseball!
Discovered a cure for baldness.
Whatever. Listen, I'm very concerned about this guy.
No, Julie, Julie, don't insult me. You know, what difference does it make who pays for lunch. It's totally meaningless.
Whooo.. (To a waitress taking orders) Ooh.. French fries.
(sniffing) Hmm. Game hen?
The government is very touchy about us being in the air. Let us run around on the ground as much as we want. Anything in the air is a big production.
Good. Now get out.
Really?
(Long pause) ..Felt like it. I tell you, this doll is pretty spooky. (Takes off his glasses, rubbing his eye) It's freakin' me out man. And now I got to go back out there and pick up this doormat.
The thing is...I'm supposed to be T-bone.
This you are not going to believe. Al Netchie, that pimple. Tells Daphne, not get this 'Not to get involved with me.'
Um, hi, its George, George Costanza, remember me? The guy that didnt come up for coffee. You see, I didnt realise that coffee didnt really mean... well, whatever. Anyway, it was fun. It was... it was fun, so... oh boy, um, so... You call me back. If you want. Its up to you, you know, whatever you wanna do. Either way. The balls in your court. So uh, take it easy.
For how long?
(answers phone, good mood) Hey.
No. Why must it be so difficult? Why is there all this tension and hostility? Why can't I just walk up to a woman on the street and say, "Hi. I'm
Youre not getting no Drakes Coffee Cake for fifty cents. Yae, Hey, Im all set. I got the ticket. Im going to the Cayman Islands this Friday.
Hey, what this thing? Whew!
You cant be serious. This is New York city. There must be eleven million decent hotel rooms! Whatta you need? A flag? (waving his handkerchief) This is the signal, Jerry, this is the signal!
We had an incredible phone conversation. We talked for like twenty minutes. I threw away my notes in the middle of the call. You know, I thought she had a great voice timbre. Is it timbre or tamber?
Can't live!
Kramer, I cant believe it. Oh, youre my hero!
I don't want hope. Hope is killing me. My dream is to become hopeless. When you're hopeless, you don't care, and when you don't care, that indifference makes you attractive.
(Standing in the doorway) I'm fine with it! Fi-hi-hi-hine I say! (Leaves)
Is she socially awkward?
They always make me take stock of my life. And how Ive pretty much wasted all of it, and how I plan to continue wasting it.
It is. I'm just not ready yet.
(to Jerry) You watch the old videos. (insistent) I'm telling you, look at him.
Excuse me, uh I couldn't help but notice that you were looking in my direction.
(Outraged) "That's all"?! That's everything! I don't know what all the rest of it is for anyway!
Well, as I say, the pink-eye made my vision...quite blurry... (Joe's daughter comes to the door.)
Well Dad's been planning this for such a long time, he bought a new blanket, and he got tha...that game with foam paddles and the velcro ball. (laughs)
No one's putting a gun to your head. Do I, uh, scare you?
Well, uhm, I think I'd like to do it.
What am I supposed to get, a bazooka?
Would you like a Pepto-Bismol? I keep them in my wallet...! (Russell goes into the bathroom and shuts the door.) (To Jerry) Do you think he liked it? (From the bathroom, we hear Russell violently heaving his guts.)
Attention Steinbrenner and front-office morons! Your triumphs mean nothing. You all stink. You can sit on it, and rotate! This is George Costanza. I fear no reprisal. Extension five-one-seven-oh.
(on the answering machine) Jerry, what's happening? Come on, pick up the phone.
Go, go, go, don't worry about it.
(doing the voice) Not at all.
Where you going?
I'm not through here, Jerry. (Picks up the model of the conference room.) I'm gonna keep on investigating. This thing is like an onion. The more layers you peel, the more it stinks. (Pam enters, George leaves.)
Nah. It's all right. Great! She had a good time.
What?
Well you didn't have to say it like that.
You already got it.
Really? ..You think.
You bought non-refundable tickets, you idiot!
Oh, yeah, sure, accident, right. She was aiming right at me like she was putting out a fire! Then, for the rest of the show, I'm sitting there with chocolate all over my shirt. Flies are landing on me. I'm boiling - I'm fantasizing all the things I'm gonna say when I see her. And later, finally, backstage when I talk to her, I'm a groveling worm. "What kind of chocolate was that? Do you throw any other foods?"
Jerry, it's fantastic. I love the people over there. They- they treat me so great. You know they think I'm handicapped, they gave me this incredible office, a great view.
I'm unbelievable at spelling last names. Give me a last name.
Very good. Go on.
Huh (quietly)
Hi.
Elaine?
What? You dont like this?
Ah. She's great, isn't she?
So how do you want to do this?
Hey.
Well why couldn't you include me in your excuse?
Don't you see. Women like that are like, members of a secret tribe living in a forbidden city. People like me have not been inside in thousands of years.. But with this, it's like I've already been with one of her own! My hands been stamped! I come and go as I please!
But now I have my own market research. Actual Japanese viewers, that love the show! I'm gonna talk to Kramer.
ha Ha..
Eat me alive, huh? We'll see who can make it in *this* town.
so, uh, Steven.. I see you're president of the chess club.
I'm gonna get some more of these kosher cocktail franks.. (leaves)
Do you speak English?...English!!
Oh well, gracias El Commandante, gracias. Muy muy.
Tub is love?
Pre-nup of course ..Kramer....
It's all politics.
You want your blankets tucked in?
Who's the Drake?
So, you're taking his side?
(sets down his paper) So how were the eggs?
Wait. Whoa! That's the Rabbi from Elaine's building. I just met this guy the other day.
You're with a *woman*!
Ah, great. All right, with the wine I'm in over twenty dollars now.
Yes! Yes, I heard the 'squink'!
(bored to death) Well, I-I just recently uh...
Hi. Look at how obtrusive this is.
George.
Thats so brutal, I hate that.
He's on the lamb(?), he's on the loose!
You know a matron?
Yeahhh.
Hey! Did 'ya ever do that thing on the toes that I said .
I offered to pay. She should've said no.
Ha! Ha! Hey! (moving his arms like it's so great to be all here)
Stay back! (Runs out of the room, pushing Jerry out ahead of him)
He fired me.
Me, too.
Yeah, me too.
Oh, thanks, Bobby. (To Celia) Well, I guess I'll see you in four days.
I'm goin' in!
Well just take an overview. Can't you just take an overview?
I don't even like to sit next to a man on an airplane 'cause our knees might touch.
That's my whole afternoon! I was going to look for sneakers.
Well, you know, book reports. That kind of stuff.
Well, you know, it's really very funny, because you know what we got here, really? We really, really, just have a terrible misunderstanding. You see, when I passed on the deal, I thought that's what Jerry wanted me to say. Y'know, I, I misinterpreted.
Y'know what it is? It's "Clara Nightingale Syndrome." He falls ill; she falls in love.
Burned.
Oh, please don't tell me you love me again, Jerry, I can't handle it.
I went to the beach. (Jerry and Elaine exchange looks)
Except for one small problem. Hah, I left some books in her apartment.
I want your honest opinion about something.
(standing) C'mon, what're you talking about?
Two fifty? Are you sure
The Rosses have started up a foundation, Jerry, and I have to sit on the board of directors.
One... (Glenda seeing George is serious; gets up and leaves)
So we're not going?
Well I-I...
I feel like a huge weights been lifted off my shoulders. I... I... I feel happy! Kramer, I dont know how to thank you!
China.
Look, I guarantee she won't know.
Students cant clean. Its anathema. (explaining) They dont like it.
(nervous) All right now we're going bye bye.
Ma, will you stop?... Its just a statue!... How is it my fault?!... It was stolen. I didnt even touch it this time... Okay, fine... I dont see why this should affect to potatoes!... Okay... Goodbye. (George hangs up.) She doesnt react to disappointment very well. Unlike me.
So it's just mono.
Ok, everybody, uh...I have an announcement to make. From now on, I will be known as-
Well, she probably just assumed.
You see?.. You see?!
(pleading) Well, my bed is too small.
There, there I'm fine.
Cops. I don't even care about cops. I wanna see more garbage men. It's much more important. All I wanna see are garbage trucks, garbage cans and garbage men. You're never gonna stop crime, we should at least be clean.
(Needing to get away from his parents, he gets up) I need some air..
"Ha..harrr."
...you'll see, things will be different now - if you just give me one more chance.
Roll up your sleeve.
Well, after dinner last week, she invites me back to her apartment.
You are my friend.
My little man doesn't know.
Yearn? Do I yearn?
She's off. (goes over to the now available public phone)
But I was thinking...T-bone.
Well I think I'm better off going one-on-one.
(While pointing at Jerry) Not me! Him! His fault! He betrayed me!
I don't know.
What, I can't stop by and visit my parents? (Drops pamphlet on coffee table)
Gimme half!
Well, it's a tough decision. I have to wear these every day. I'm deciding on a new face.
Yes faddah.
Yeah. She's uh, she's something, isn't she?
( rubbing his eye) Ow, Ow you squirted me.
Helping people... Of course. Of course! It makes perfect sense! How could I *not* be doing this!? I am gonna help somebody, Dammit!
I climbed out the window.
85, Jerry! 85 IQ !
No, no no. That skips a generation. The baldness gene comes from your grandfather.
(getting animated) Look I, I uh, I had nothing to do with this. It wasn't my decision. It was Jerry! Jerry told me no. I'm the creative guy. He handles the business end.
What a movie. Good choice.
Yeah, 5A!
Hello?
Hey, Tim.
(Runs over to him, not wanting him to leave) What? You're going?
Oh yeah, like you know.
No. No
Oh, oh, your papers
How do you know?
I got a job interview. They want to see me this afternoon.
Yeah. I may have stepped on her arm, too, I don't know.
Wait a second, wait a second, what coming in, what woman is coming in?
Oh, hi.. (They shake hands)
Hi, it's me. It's Georgie Boy. What's going on?
Hey, you're hurting me!
But really, it's enough with the bar already.
Ahh, money.
What if he left you a used Kleenex, what's that, a valentine? Now you go up to him and you tell him that if he's thinking of turning me in, that I got the goods on him!
Me? It wasn't me I never even saw the ball. All you do is dribble.
(knocking on the counter and feigning a muffled, Chinese voice) Chinese food!
Personally I'm a little nervous about going through these things. I'm afraid I'm gonna step through into another dimension.
(smiling) Listen, I..I..I don't mean to seem forward...
I'm gonna play frolf.
Me? Oh yeah.
It's right in the explosion scene. So if you could just...leave me a little window. You know, my, uh, my aunt had a thing removed with a laser. All right, I don't want to interrupt your meal, so...
Yesterday, took the day off. (Picks up a red Power Ranger action figure from the model and pretends it's him.) Now, from the time I left the room...
Oh, my God! My *MOTHER*!!!
Well, You're not gonna believe it...
No, I did not! (They exit the coffee shop.)
Yeah, fun. IQ tests are totally bogus. They prove nothing.
Yeah you made it, how about that.
This country needs more people like you!
Jerry, where did you get that sweater?
(Showing Jerry up) Listen carefully. My mother has never laughed. Ever. Not a giggle, not a chuckle, not a tee-hee.. never went 'Ha!'
Yeah, eighty-three. Used to belong to John Voight.
She just dislikes me so much... It's irresistable.
Don't you understand? It's not about him. To have a line as perfect as 'jerk store' and to never use it. I, I couldn't live with myself.
You think I should come clean? What d'you think, you think I Should confess?
All right. All right. (They both leave)
Oh, I love full lips. Something you can really put the lipstick on.
Alright, alright, fine. (Gives the keys to Elaine.)
Oh-ho, yeah?
Do you hear yourself?
Joe...could you...
Well , not yet.. Fianc.
Then who are the Dutch?
No, it's not.
(shouts) Of course there's something wrong! (points at Jerry) We had a pact!
Ya!
So then what?
Didja see the way she was looking at me?
"Jerry", oh my God. He wants to talk about "Jerry"?
Come on, itll be so much easier.
Every time we go out to eat the minute we we're done eating she's runnin to the bathroom.
Yeah, six weeks.
Uh, yes, actually we-we both do.
What?
Absolutely nothing.
Dad, the hinges are all rusted here. That's why the wind keeps blowing the door off.
Hey! what are listening to?
What did you go on a picnic?
Jerry did you wash this pear?
You got mugged?
What, have you completely lost your mind?
Look, we're not gonna be that long anyway... we have to get to the "party"!
Volunteer work, huh?
Look, you don't understand. There was shrinkage.
Wait a second. I think I see where that laser guy is. No! Don't look! Don't look. Oh, yeah, that's him. Ok. I'm gonna sneak up on him. Now the hunted becomes the hunter.
(Reading the card from Whatley) "This holiday season a donation has been made in your name to the Children's Alliance."?
Because I know him too, and probably a lot better than you.
(Reading) I see your G.P.A's a 4.0.
What, what happened to you?
Well, I'll tell you, Stacey. It's a lot of hard work. But, it comes fairly easy to me. Some people write symphonies. This is my gift. (Raises ski lift ticket while Stacey looks away)
Well, I'm, I'm just looking.
Oh, yes I am. Mr. Thomassoulo likes to play dirty. Well, theres nothing dirtier than a giant ball of oil.
(panicking) Right, I knew I felt something!
I suppose he's an attractive man, I ,
(melancholy) I wish that was all needed. Life can be so confusing. I..I'm searching for answers, anywhere.
I have to say, as a glasses wearer I take exception to that. That's like me buying a wheelchair to cruise around in.
I gotta go.
" 'course not"
Yeah.
You wanna sell computers? I will show *you* how to sell computers! Hello, Mr. Farneman. You wanna buy a computer? No? Why not? All right, I see! Good answer! Thank you! (Lloyd rings his sale bell) Serenity now!
I can't eat with you leanin' over like this. Just look straight forward.
What am I scared of? I'm scared of the same thing that you are, everything! Why don't you just use your own name?
Oh, this is all locking in now. It is all locking in! (laughing)
Good.
Right, can we go? Cause Im double-parked, Im gonna get a ticket.
Uh, Mr Wilhelm.
Two-man? It's all me. Kruger doesn't do anything; Disappears for hours at a time, gives me fake excuses. This afternoon I found him with sleep creases on his face. The only reason I got out to get a bite today was that he finally promised to buckle down and do some actual work. (turning around, George sees Mr. Kruger at a booth eating a piece of cake) Oh, I don't believe this. This is what I have to put up with, Jerry. (He walks over) Mr. Kruger? Who said he was going to do some actual work today? Who?
You could take the IQ test for me. I could pass it to you out a window. We could do it, she lives in the first floor.
Its George.
I can't believe that you saw her before me.
I am?
No!
(he drops a paper airplane he was holding) Mr. Wilhelm!
(singing) Oh hey, if you happen to see the most beautiful girl who walked out on me. Tell her I'm sorry. Tell her I need my baby ... oh won't you tell her ... I love her. Oh hey, ...
It's all pipes! What's the difference?!
Why?!
I dont know where the nurse is. Sweetheart why dont you get a nurse for mommy?  Anyway I was just curious. Remember the other day you were saying something about my trip.
All right, so are you ready, so we'll go out and get something to eat.
Okay.
You go in and save seats.
Simple joke from a simple man.
Going backstage is the worst. Especially when they stink. You know that's a real problem.
People break up all the time.
Why didn't you ask me? I know a million theater jokes. 'What's the deal with those guys down in the pit?'
The point is, however it got done, it's done. So, any luck with the car?
What do you want?
Well, I took the liberty of packing your things. (gleeful) Mom's coming to get you.
I asked if I could borrow a sweater.
. . . I thought the woman was kind of cute.
I didn't get the special, but I'd also like the fresh fruit too.
No, no. It wasn't a shift, I've shifted, this was a move.
Excuse me sir. Would you mind watching my bag for a minute?
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. What about the pact?
The doctors thought he had cancer, but the surgery revealed he never actually had it.
(Drawing attention back to him) Excuse me!
No, you're gonna sit down, you son of a gun...
No, Kramer. I have to have this statue.
I was curious! (imitating his moms voice)
(from the street below Jerry's window) Jerry!
I need to look for my glasses.
Of course.
I think you're right. You gonna eat that?
What? Must be a big one.
Yes, yes, I definitely waited. But let me say this Once he passes on that option, that 'God bless you' is up for grabs.
Well I'm very excited about this. I've always wanted to see how those sketch artists do it.
No. No. No. No. No. Don't worry. It's perfectly safe. I researched it. He'll get a little woozy. He might keel over.
Oh, look, he's going to ask you about my arm. So, just tell him I banged it against a desk. And it's been moving involuntarily ever since.
I don't know.
That is an opening.
Im letting you in.
I am not giving you my code.
Alright, now the play is tomorrow night. So do you want to have dinner first, or do you just want to meet at the theatre?
That's your boyfriend.
. . . . . . Yeah.
I don't see how I could perform sexually in a situation after something like that. I was completely emasculated. Anyway, it's not the only reason.
Tsss...Yeah..
(as Jerry and Elaine continue to whine) Give it! Give it! (he finally gets the remote away from them) Pinheads.
I know. That's the point. If it's gonna get sexual, it should get sexual with you.
What happened to Putty?
Hey, Kramer, where are you going?
(Laughs) yeah, burned. Whoo..
Come on!
(eating a pickle) Well they're his tickets, he can do what he wants with them.
A preemptive breakup. This is an incredible idea. I got nothing to lose. We either break up which she would do anyway but at least I go out with some Dignity. Completely turn the tables. It's absolutely brilliant.
No.
Hey.
Is that tolerable?
Yo, dad. This is my boss, Mr. Kruger.
Thanks a lot. Ill give it back to you in a week.
I can see that.
I like DeSoto.
It was a good jig.
Uh, anyway, (Waving bye to everyone) onward and upward.
Dwayne, my friend and I would like to exchange frames. Could you put his lenses in my frames and mine in his?
No. Youd be surprised. You dont recover that quickly from a nose job.
No, I'm not. I would like to be, but I'm not. What am I gonna do? The book club meets in a few days.
Huh, really? How bad? Was he on his death bed?
They would never tell me, Elaine. First of all, they probably think that I killed Susan. Besides, I don't even think they like me. (Jerry comes over to the table.)
So, he's keeping the apartment. He doesn't deserve it, though! Even if he did suffer, that was, like, 40 years ago! What has he been doing lately?! I've been suffering for the past 30 years up to and including yesterday!
We discussed toilet paper.
Excuse me, I'm sorry to bother you, I noticed that you have a textbook on tape. May I ask where you got that?
Never.
Right! And these pigeons broke the deal. I will not accept the blame for this!
Step-skipper. That man is a step-skipper! He skips Step Nine!
How are we gonna get out of here? We need a plan!
(Defensively) You can look at them, but do NOT touch them. (Holds them out)
No.
Lo..k, if you want to taste mine, you don't have to offer me some of yours.
(inhales deeply) I tell you, Jerry, I'm feeling something. Something I haven't felt in a long time.
Oh, I was uh, I was waiting downstairs for the jackhammer, thought I'd drop by.
Howbout sports? Do you follow sports?
Well, that was bound to happen.
Yeah. Actually it was in gym class. I was trying to climb the ropes and Jerry was spotting me. I kept slipping and burning my thighs and then finally I slipped and fell on Jerry's head. We've been close ever since.
Bye Mrs Seinfeld, take care.
Your hair?
All right! Come on! Let's not fight.
hitting phone
(entering Jerry's bathroom) Well, Hanke's moved on to Step Ten. He was spotted taking personal inventory.
Hey, whats goin on?
He said that? (Daphne shacks her head) What a nerve. How dare he say something like that.
Really!
Well, you should always consider podiatry. (Patting Ricky on the shoulder) There's nothing wrong with the feet. (Ricky looks critically back at George)
Well, if she keeps horsing around with that tractor--
It's worth a shot. (Goes to the door.)
Fifty bucks a month, that's incredible! Okay, thanks.
Kramer, what the hell are you talking about?
Its a great thrill to meet you, Sir.
(Losing it) does not imply transfer of ownership. Moe, Sol, or Lem is not gonna get away with this!
Vandelay!
She's, uh, she's heard of Merlot.
The only thing that bothers me is that I'm just coming up with this now.
She's too tanned. It's the middle of the winter, she's like a carrot.
Where's the luck? There's no luck. 1,900 dollars down the drain.
No.
I'm in a transition phase right now.
I don't know how a fish could eat laughs.
Chamberlind, you could hold his head in nthe toilet, he'd still give you half of Europe.
How'd she find it?
It's really not accurate. Nobody drinks from a water cooler any more - they use bottles.
You heard it fifty times already.
I...I...write a letter and then I..I go to China. I disappear in a sea of people for like six months, a year you know just while things simmer down. Ehm.. Ehm...Dear Susan. I'm sorry. I made a terrible mistake. I'm really , really sorry.
(Takes it and throws it out window) Get outta my way!
Shes a pig. The woman's a pig, what wrong with her--
Hey, where's you AIDS ribbon?
I hurt it in a hotel room. You know where they tuck the covers in real tight in those hotel rooms? I can't sleep like that so I tried to kick it out and I pulled it.
(to himself) A cane. I knew it. (to Neil) So, we meet at last. I admire your skills, Mr Peanut.
They send me? Aw right ..ask 'em Does it really work?
Maybe he's, um... mixed.
Well I was just going to wander the streets. Don't wanna tag along with you or anything.
He..He threatened me.
There's a hundred different things here. What's the difference between these two? (They each grab a box and check the ingredients) You got propylparabin?
I'm, uh, George Costanza. I was having dinner with your son.
Well this worked out okay. So are you going to see the police woman?
Elaine, I'm, I'm shocked. I'm shocked. Here I go out in the spirit of the season (Elaine looking like she's not buying a word of it) and spend all my savings to buy you the most beautiful Christmas sweater I have ever seen to show my appreciation to you at Christmas and this is the thanks that I get at Christmas.
Finished your thought.
All right, just gimme that. And gimme some of those Sweet & Lows.
Oh my God.
And then, then, then she leaves with somebody else! Never even, never even said goodbye! Never called me back.. Never apologized. Nothing. Like I was dirt.
Vandelay? The judge's name is Vandelay?
Look I need you to do me a favor. I need you to get me lunch at Pisano's.
A garden! I cant believe theres a garden!
It strikes me a lot of guys are doing that kind of humor now.
I don't. Susan wants to have it out when Sally comes tomorrow.
What?
Good morning Mr. Wilhelm.
Please...
(after a moment's thought) Art Vandelay.
What?
Oh, Scott, Scott. He's really great, isn't he?
Excuse me. Are you using your catsup?
Yes yes yes This is unbelievable.
We did?
That's right. You ready?
Smarter than me? I don't want anyone smarter than me.
He gave me a wedgie.
I had the arm! Joe...
You know what this means? I can't see her anymore either.
(to Jimmy) Wh...Where d'you get'em?"
Okay. (They walk around each other.) OK. Ill choose you. Whaddaya want?
Do me a favor would you? Would you change lanes? Would you get outta this lane. You gotta get out of this lane. This lane stinks. They're all double parked here Please get outta this lane. I'm beggin you please please.
Lupe. That's very nice, very nice. Listen, are you going to be making up the bed in the morning?
You know, like all the comedians always say, 'How would you like it if I came to where you work and heckled you?'
What, you think I'm doing material here?
What's desert?
Kramer, hey, hey! (Gets up out of his seat)
(ignoring Jerry) I mean I'm not really working right now.
Allison! Hi! Oh, my God! How are you?
I hate him!
It's possible.
It's *not* *true*!
What?
(hurriedly leaves Rudy's) They had plans, They had plans!
What is Holland?
I can't tell you.
Hi honey..
Well, I shouldn't have to pay for it!
No, no. Deena, it's not what you think.
Wohoo, check it out.
Did he just steal the raisins?
...ah (picks up the bag) Damn salami.
Del Boca Vista!
(Sliding over to make room for her) Sit down. Join us, please.
(excited) Great news! I showed the pilot to Kramer's Japanese friends. They loved it!
Holes! I need holes!
He got about uh, two inches from... there.
What! There's no signs here! This is an outrage!
You see (to Jerry). You see. You see what Im talking about. It's all just slipping away. And you're letting it happen. (exits -- slamming the door)
Oh yeah yeah, don't you know they used pastrami in that movie 9? weeks? Remember the pastrami scene?
It's a big region.
Hey, what about this? I'm in a car accident. The motorist is uninsured, you with me?
Like this.
He's an obscure writer. Betnik, on the village.
(on phone, as Jerry gestures beside him) No, Lindsay, it was not IN the garbage. It was above the garbage. Hovering. Like an angel. Of course I know your aunt bit it. I kissed her goodbye. Listen, can I tell you something else? In my family, we used to eat out of the garbage all the time. (Jerry makes a face) It was no big thing. That's right. Oh, okay. Buh-bye. (hangs up phone) I'm back in, she gave me a second chance.
(entering) Last night, huh? Was that something, or was that something?
I'm pretty sure I wouldn't.
'scuse me. I uh, I was in here this morning and uh, I believe I paid you with a twenty dollar bill, (smiles) but you only gave me change for a ten.
(snorts) C'mon.
How's everything going? Everything O.K.?
Why did he tell you and not me?
You're out?!
Boy, these are really bad details.
Oh, that would be wonderful.
Well she apologized, and then she wanted to know if we could get together Wednesday afternoon.
Y'know, now you gotta ask her her name. It's so embarrassing.
I guess there are no small diseases, only small actors.
I put my pants on, Sid.
Im going to find out whats going on. All right?
Is there something wrong with my parents?
She's got everything, right? (counts on his fingers) She's intelligent, she's smart, she's got a great sense of humour.
Excuse me?
Its not easy.
(penny drops) Oh, uh, wait a minute, wait a minute. (snorts) Is this about money?
It's all worked out. Nina and I will have dinner Thursday at the restaurant where Babs works.
What?
Alright, now. What mood am I in, what mood am I in?
Uh-Huh (gulp) Why didn't she like me?
Yeah, I'm sorry.
That's pretty paranoid.
Yeah. (another pause) Not that I care, one way or the other, but these doctors today really do amazing things, you know, if you were so inclined. And again, I'm not suggesting.
All right, great.
Don't jinx it! Don't jinx (trails off quietly in elation)
(in his mind) I think that ginger ale at the coffee shop is just Coke and Sprite mixed together. How can I prove it? Ah! Can't, dammit. (knock at door. George goes to open it)
I enjoy understanding.
(disbelief) What?! They're stealing the name?! That's my name, I made it up!
Of course I'm back. Why wouldn't I be back? My mother's in the hospital, I'm going to pay her a visit.
(adamant) It's smart. It's a smart line, and a smart crowd will appreciate it. (shouting) And, I'm not gonna dumb it down for some bonehead mass audience!
How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria?
Yeah, is he still mad at you for crashing his Thanksgiving party?
Why not? What do I care?
Yeah.
I know what you were trying to do. Nobody does it better than me.
Hey, can I flip on the siren?
Well, I'm still here. You took out the other guy!
(Takes two oven mitts from his back pack) Alright, (puts them on) I gotta get going.
I never heard of anyone would turned down an apartment because of a weak shower spray.
That's what nuns and Red Cross workers are for.
I don't know of this is the house. I don't see Jerry's car anywhere.
So, what? We're gonna do nothing now, this is crazy.
Oh yeah. So wait, wait. A half-hour later Im back in the office, I tell Lloyd the whole story. He says, So why dont you call her? I says, I cant. I couldnt, I couldnt do it right then. For me to ask a woman out I gotta get into a mental state like the karate guys before they break the bricks. So Lloyd calls me a wuss.
I don't know, I just can't. Nobody in my family can pay for parking, it's a sickness. My father never paid for parking; my mother, my brother, nobody. We can't do it.
You know, when I was a kid, we didn't have these elaborate birthday parties w-with catered food and entertainment. I remember my 7th birthday party...
You know what, I'll just uh, I'll just look around for a little while. (moving to come round the counter) I'll just browse around.
What a succinct story.
You guys ever shot anybody?
Oh no no no, if you must know, I would rather be with her than go to the game.
All right, shmoopies...what's it gonna be? Pick a theater.
We could build a cabin like (Snaps) that.
It's an inter-office envelope. It get passed around all over the office.
Thats beautiful.
Okay, the point is made.
Yeah, it bothers me. Doesn't it bother you?
All right, what are we doing?
Not as thin as you think.
A biopsy!
Or something. I said, Or Something!
Well why don't you get a hold of it and change what you don't like.
You really think so?
A-and don't settle for 145, you can do better, you're a genius. Heheheh (laughs)
Jerry! Oh, my God! What are you doing!?!
That's what they tell me!
Don't do it!
Her roommate. I've driven women to lesbianism before but never to a mental institution.
Cosmo?
I told her we'd all go out afterwards, okay? And don't applaud when she stops playing the first time. It's not over yet.
So the Wig master.......the Wig master said you could stop by the theater tonight.. and he'll show you around.
Because great couples always have a great story about how they met. That's why I've never been in a long term relationship. I've never had a good meeting story.
I had a job interview.
I think it moved. Oh my god, I think it moved. Yeah, give me the big piece. I'll see you later.
Yeah! She made me promise not to tell you .It's supposed to be a joke.
Well. Gotta motor.
I cant believe how easy it is. Im virtually Orthodox. All I have to do is read a few books, memorize a few prayers, and Im in the club.
Get up, get up, its her! Oh, the hell with this, Im scared to death, just walk away, its off, cancel everything, go!
Well nothing. I didn't actually say that. (Karen is still laughing)
He's ripping you off
(As he leaves) One would hope.
I like this area. I could live out here.
"Whhhoooo!!!!"(taps on his desk loudly)
Because my cousin's imbecile dog was rolling around outside and they got in his carpet.
(pause) Dad! I heard you were in the city the other day!
Alright?
(taking the phone from Elaine) Jerry, why is Elaine getting your mail?
Dont think it cant happen! (Leaves)
(Apprehensively) Um. I just realized. Ya' never gave me back the change from the tolls.
You know, I haven't eaten anything.
Just because a candy bar fails to fall from its perch
(irascible) Oh, I see. So your time is more valuable than mine. Is that it? You're a delicate genius!
(coughs) I've always smoked.
She's playing a recital this week at the McBierney School. You wanna hear her play? I got two extra tickets, you and Elaine could go...
Wax Museum.
Does the heater even work in this car?
(Wanting Elaine to take it off his hands, he tries to silence Jerry) Jerry, simmer down.
What? Too short?
Cut it.
Who?
Alright, so I haven't put anything in it since sixth grade, I completely forgot about it. The State Controller's Office tracks me down. The interest has accumulated to 1,900 dollars. 1,900 dollars! They're sending me a cheque!
Nooo...
Well then she's just a Liar, Isn't she?
That's it. This is it. I'm done. Through. It's over. I'm gone. Finished. Over. I will never work for you again. Look at you. (laughing) You think you're an important man? Is that what you think? You are a laughingstock. You are a joke. These people are laughing at you. You're nothing! You have no brains, no ability, nothing! (knocking object over on desk) I quit!
Innocent mistake.
No.
Like a park bench?
Parking in a handicap spot. Right in the middle of his United Volunteers meeting. When he got back, he chased after me with a baseball bat.
He dropped it.
What if she discusses it with Jane?
I can't believe you're really going out with a woman named Lois.
Oh, yeah, right. I wish I had something on my mind. (pregnant pause) So how about that Kramer, huh?
All right.
All right. (smiles behind her back)
(to Elaine) Do you want us to go with you?
Alright, here we go.
What red dot? What are you talking about? Jerry come here for a second. Do you see anything here?
Would you stop that please. Would you just stop that?
Hi Beth (Scene Ends then re-begins with Beth and George on Beth's couch) Um anyway Jerry told me that uh.. it might have been my comment in the Coffee Shop that broke you up.
Look at that guy. Right there. Isn't that the guy from the show? He's..he's wearing the jacket.
Wh.. Where you going?
(incredulous) You can't ground me, I'm a grown man.
Mon...? No, no, I can't wait til Monday, that's impossible, I gotta talk to him now. Where does he live?
Nothing. Uh, I don't know. I gotta go.
(to Jody) You're listening to this?
Hey Rachel!
Yes, I am.
So you slept with her?
Baah! There it is! You just said it! That's what I want! Now say it again, and tell it to me.
What are you up to now, uh, Step Nine?
Yeah? Well, I had sex with your wife.
All this in 5 days. Hmm.
Hey, Elaine.
It's a very complicated move! I couldn't remember it all.
Hey Deena, come on, give us a hug. (they hug) Oh my gosh, you look as pretty as you did back in high school.
Well, they hurt him bad. Really hurt his feelings. It's a long story. I- I don't like to talk about it, but I swore then that I would never work for big broker-houses. See, all they care about is money. I'm about more than money, I'm about people, always gone my own way and I've never looked back.
Could there be a native p0roblem in the Caymans? Maybe theres native unrest.
What should I do?
Excuse me, I was waiting here.
I didn't even know Fulton was in the hospital.
Hey, I'm getting in on that.
She missed her period? Oh my god. I can't believe it! I'm a father! I did it! My boys can swim! I can do it! I can do it!
Ah. You see, the man who was the butler, uh, had gotten into a car accident with Jerry, and because he didn't have any insurance, the judge decreed that the man become Jerry's butler.
I didn't think you wore them anymore.
I was moving it across the street, I looked up and I saw Woody Allen and I got all distracted.
I don't want to! I'm outta money! I got 714 dollars left in the bank.
129 west 81st street and hurry.
I know, sir. It won't happen again.
Happy? Why should I be happy?
What?
Yes you did!
I feel like I'm in bed with my mother.
So, uh, you gonna see him again?
(smiling expectantly) Here it comes.
There was nothing else on. Oh, the left arm.. the left arm.
[to himself] Argh! [to Susan] Susan! Hi! Oh, boy! What are you doing here?!
Yeah, good night.
This is just what I need.
Well you know in college they used to call me the little bulldog.
You want to be with somebody that doesn't like you.
Boy, I wish the flamenco was popular here.
You're uh, physical therapist, right?
I am such a Huge whale fan. These marine biologists were showin' how they communicate with each other with these squeaks and squeals, what a fish!
Well, I might be getting into that.
All right.
I can't just leave.
No, no I do. You know it's just...
(upset) But you can't stay here. There's no place to sleep!
Yeah.
Miss Rhode Island? When are you seeing her?
It's not contest. The guy had nothing! The ship went down, he got into a life boat, I mean, come on.
It's Allison. I dated her right after you. She's obsessed with me.
(absently leaving with it) Thanks.
Well, we'll just see.
Hi...
No, No! She's going out with a friend of mine. It's only courteous that we should try and like each other.
(with a mouth full of food) This is good. Oh, this is good.
Well, it doesn't even have to be the general manager. Maybe I could be like, an announcer. Like a color man. You know how I always make those interesting comments during the game.
What?
What? Huh, so I had it all along. How d'you like that? (snorts) I guess I owe that cashier an apology.
Oh... (George looks around and sees the chef hiding behind a plant it's Bob!)
But, uh, Raymond is a man.
What about a rec room? Huh? Or a community center.
(Shocked) You caved?!
(shifty, avoiding Jerry's eyes) Fine, fine. (he removes his coat)
Oh no, you're not going out on a high note with me Mr. Kruger!
Oh. (Goes back into the bathroom.)
...especially a girl. Or a boy.
He's right. never.
Yeah. Not only that, this is what she said to me, "Can we change the subject?"
Now Peterman wants me to go to the funeral.
(wondering) Maybe he doesn't. Maybe he and I are exactly the same, except for one minor, yet crucial, detail. You never know.
You wanted to see me, Mr. Steinbrenner?
What, you know Kramer?!
That's amazing.
Shut your traps and stop kicking the seats! We're trying to watch the movie! And if I have to tell you again, we're gonna take it outside and I'm gonna show you what it's like! You understand me? Now, shut your mouths or I'll shut 'em for ya, and if you think I'm kidding, just try me. Try me. Because I would love it!
All right. You wanna know what one of her favorite expressions is? Happy, Pappy?
Hey, I'm his nephew, all right? Don't worry about it. Go ahead. Check it out.
Really? Why?
We talked about his new batting stance, you know, I'm not crazy about it, but I said , 'Donny, go with it 'till it stops workin'.' Donny baseball. He's a helluva guy.
You know, you could've just given me Neil's number. You..you didn't have to take me out to dinner.
(sad) It's only four..
he he (laughs)
Love to! (Cracks his knuckles, then winces under the pain)
Boy - I'm really surprised at Elaine - that whole phone business - she should know better than that.
(yells) Wow! Who put this cup right on the new table!
L-Look at this?
Ah, come on
He's older, completely covered in filth, no whistle, but I think it's him.
Okay, go ahead. Call her, get married, have babies, have a great life.. What do I care? I'm finished. (Really depressed) It's all over for me. In fact, let's end it right now. Jerry, kill me, kill me now. I'm begging you. Let's just get it over with. Be a pal.. Just take the pillow and put it over my face.
Take it easy. Take it easy. It's not the end of the world.
I am ready.
Well, he has to play! He can't just not play. We're playing! Look, I gotta see him, how do I get in touch with him?
Always.
Now if you will kindly help me unwedge my front wheel, I'll be on my way.
That's not how it happened. It's when he fell on him with his knee.
So do I, but I wouldn't hang it on a wall.
Do you? That makes me so happy. Elaine's proud of me Jerry.
(using the phone) Watch how it's done. Oh, hello, Mr. Vandelay? Would you like to buy a computer? Oh, really? Two dozen?
There's something I have to tell you.
(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o Kramer!
No. I--I paid for it.
Get out of here.
Jerry, unless I pull down on this statuette and a hidden wall opens up, we have checked every square inch of this apartment!
Yes well unfortunately you'll never get the chance to find out.
Can't leave the car here!
I uh, took care of that.
Why are two pretending to be laughing?
Hey.
(to Jerry) Ready?
Yes, yes, you know I was in detention and she came up behind me while I was erasing the blackboard . . .
Look at this. There's no spaces here. (to another car) Excuse me, are you gettin' out?
Right.
Huh, strawberries, anyone? (eats a strawberry) Ah, that's good. Ooh, juicy this time of year.
Up again?! This is incredible! Im.. Im getting it.
So, anyway, what's uh, what's the status with, uh...
Hey, Buck. Talk to you for a second?
I don't believe it.
The last time I saw her, she was naked.
Don't be soured.
(on an imaginary microphone) Uh, no, not at this time.
Come on, lets not stand here too long, we might run in to her.
Jerry, please?
(Snaps, then points to the coffee table) Hand me an Emory board.
No..hummm, What do you know about what you look like.
Can you believe that guy?
I don't know. That's all gonna change.
Mint?
Wish I could. (raises the magazine up in front of his face and continues reading.)
She had this throaty , sexy kind of whisper.
Kramer!
Still upset. Very upset.
You know, it's very impolite to tell secrets. Are you talking about me?
What are you doing here?
You know, the guy from Cheers.
The Rogue's Wallet. That's where he kept his card, his dirty little secret. Short, devious, balding. his name was Costanza. He killed my mother.
Alright, but no later, because my parents are coming back.
Oh, I think so, and I can prove it. You see, I was doodling on the bill and uh, so if you have a twenty in there with big lips on it... well, (smiles) that's mine. Would you mind opening up the register?
Mark, is this true?
How're the folks?
I banged it on the desk in the doctor's office. An (worriedly rubbing his arm) aaaa . . .
Who's he?
The, uh, actor that played Jesus made some odd choices.
What?!
Faking? What makes you think that I have time to see doctors, take X-rays, make appointments, when there's absolutely nothing wrong with me? What kind of a person would do a thing like that?
You never should have taken away his keys!
I'll have 'em overnight it.
(frustrated) Not necessarily.
Alright, how's this? We wait till we get to your street corner, we see Elaine and Kramer then we get out. They can't shoot us in the city.
Because I asked you to.
Ever since I found out that you let that message on Jerry's tape recorder I...
Italian.
Because I uh, I told her the truth.
Yeah, drove away.. You know, I said 'Hello' to him. You know, he's - he's-
Here. (panicky) We'll leave it here for you!
Yes a cruise, a long cruise, just the two of you.
Say good-bye to Koko.
(Slowly shakes his head) My mother caught me.
She happens to be very good friends with her.
Is it flowing? I like flowing, cascading hair. Thick lustrous hair is very important to me.
come on it's just a game.
What accident?
(getting up) Can I keep this?
Well, you know, I was thinking about what you said before, and...you're right, I've never really been a couple, so...if that's the rule, then I'm gonna go by the rule.
(chuckling to himself) Housewarming gift. (swerving the car to go to the antique stand) All right, we're taking it up a notch!
You think?
Was my father wearing a cape?
Oh, this is my friend Jerry.
Why not?
Oh, no.
Do you think chickens have individual personalities?
Maybe a black.
Yes..
Well, I didn't think anyone would play it.
Who do I like? I, like, uh, Art, Vandelay.
Why do I do anything? tsss...For women.
Gwen really wants to go.
I don't know what the reason could be.
Blanket
This week. My father got a deal from a friend of his. It's Gore-Tex. You know about Gore-Tex?
Anyway it's kind of a fluke thing but uh I'll be leaving for Paris in two days. I will send you a postcard when I get there.
It doesn't matter if it's more comfortable. It's wrong.
Next to each other?
I thought he looked Irish.
Think I'M not?
Ya, ya. I bumped into him on the bus. What did he have to say?
She was a delicate flower.
I'll tell you what's insane the price that I could get you on a new desktop computer.
Uh-hmm.
Uuh, no, no.
Oh, no, nothing.
Ah, that is disgusting--
Eh, but, you know, Mr. Ross, if - if you look at the whole situating, what with it being your cigars, and everything, it's really rather ironic - one might even say, in a sense, comical.. (Mr. Ross has, by now, left the room. Mrs. Ross is pointing at George, nodding, laughing. As if to say he hit the bullseye. George calls out to Mr. Ross) Really. Think about it.
Yeah.
Of course not! Wash it, dry it, move on!
I'm not gonna give you my card unless you tell me what it's for!
What?
You know she was behind the idea. She was going to champion the show. That's what I was bring her up there to tell you. And she liked me.
Hey.
What? Did you get the busboy's number?
It it's huge. It's probably like North Dakota.
Susan wants me to be there.
Ok, ok, fine! It's changed, it's not really the point. Anyway, I'm thinking of making a big move.
He chose the cats?
Who?
So what's the deal they don't want to have dinner with my parents?
Oh yeah.
Hawaii?
Why don't you find a doctor that doesn't know your difficult.
Yes. I like to feel cozy. I have a very small apartment. I like to feel tucked in, nestled in. Love to be nestled.
Allllll right!
Aren't you concerned about the security guard?
Alright, maybe I do. So what.
The security guard.
What company was it?
Smoking.
Yeah.
I got me an appointment with a hardware store. I'm not saying I want to do it for the rest of my life, but, uh, hardware fascinates me. Don't you love to make a key?
I kept looking at her face. Id go, Cmon, love her. Love her!
Why didn't you take your car?
all right! rock-climbing! J..just the 2 of us? alright! hey I'll make some sandwiches, what what do you like? tuna? peanut butter?
The cabin.. (Laughs nervously) Well.. (Pauses as he thinks of a way to break the news, then decides to pass it off) Susan?
No. We're supposed to tell him tonight.
What are you going to say?
Yes!
What? What are you talking about.
I'm, you know, engaged.
My father opened his shirt...
What about personality?
Wait a second, wait a second...and then the butler says, "I'm not cleanin' it up! I'm sick of cleaning!"
(to himself) You can't tell much from those pictures.
You know, this is very nice, but I really could take a cab. Really.
All right, relax, tough guy. I got to go out to my father's garage, help him sell some computers.
(fever pitch) Marisa Tomei's sitting home, Elaine! Wh..why didn't you tell me that Katy was friends with Marisa Tomei?!
I'm trying, dammit.
No, occasionally I'll forget to let the machine pick up. Anyway, they made this large donation, to a women's prison, and I get to go down there and check it out.
Cmon. Wilkinsons got millions invested in this stock. Its gone up three points since Ive been watching it.
What's the difference? The money is not important.
Well...I've got a lot to do!
Channel eleven? Forgive me for trying to class up this place, for trying to have the Yankees reach another strata of society that might not watch channel eleven.
(on phone  calling secretary) Hello Margery, George Costanza. How are you sweet heart? Listen, can you give Mr. Thomassoulo a message for me? Yes. If he needs me, tell him (screams) IM IN MY OFFICE! Thanks.
Alright, let's just examine the situation for a second. Who, in this situation, would be more likely to make a mistake? Me, who had access to my wallet, knew exactly what was in there? Or you--
Well, we're collectors. We, uh, see objects of great beauty and, uh, we must have them.
Yeah. Got to invite The Drake. Listen hem...there's something that's been on my mind and we haven't really talked about it..I t's kind of important to me.
It was fantastic, Jerry. We wound up talking all night.
Colin O'Brien.
Because I... I love you.
Uh, can we cut to the chase?
Uh.
You're not a doctor. You shouldn't even have books like this.
Mr. Pensky. I was just working on your file. I was transferring the contents of the file into this flexible accordion-style folder.
Yeah.. (Trying to remember) Poverotti.. Domingo.. and.. uh.. the other guy.
Jerry? Why?
No. He was fine with it. Check that out.
Oh, this is my friend, Jerry Seinfeld. I just bumped into him around the corner. Isnt that a coincidence? The funny thing is, I see him all the time.
Why not?
What, are you, nuts? You're gonna spend more on the ticket than you're gonna get back from Grossbard.
Here we go, LA.
They will get a good home won't they?
You're calling her?
Because, if you ever see her and it comes up, we have to be in sync. Hmm?
Hey, where you just at the health club?
What happened to Mrs. Krantz?
I have to talk to you about something .
W--then I'm pretty much where I am now. At least I got to take a ride on a spaceship.
(inside bathroom) Nah.
See, Steinbrenner is like the first guy in, at the crack of dawn. He sees my car, he figures I'm the first guy in
Every day she comes in, she sits at that table and reads. Never talks to anybody.
This MacKenzie, he's a bit of a nut. Someone told me he fired the last guy because his nose whistled when he breathed.
Well today's your lucky day.
I love you, Jerry.
No, no. I just got here. A few minutes ago.
Alright, fine.I'll drive the 3 hours each way, 6 hours all together, and take 'em off myself!!
No.
Oh, there's better, (pointing at the row in front of them) right there, that's better.
I won't feel like a writer.
Oh, I could do it.
Oh, Hi, I'm George. (they shake hands)
MOOPS, MOOPS
Oh, its a great place, its uh two-bedroom uh, west 83rd bout half block from the park.
O.k....(is about to explain. Cut to Jerry on-stage.)
Kramer's so stringy. I'm plump, juicy.
Well, I feel better already. I'm feelin' like a good person.
Yeah, well, he probably bought it.
Rest... Sest... Hest...
No, no. I-I just want us to be... together.
I'm not stealing it. They owe me ten dollars. They stole from me.
Yeah, I got one too.
So, what did she say?
Yeah.
Ah, great, great. (sniffs) What's that smell? Smoke? (walks to the kitchen) Hey everybody, I think I smell some smoke back here...(smoke boils into the doorway.) FIRE! FIRE! Get out of the way!
Well, what do they look like?
Nah, I'm good.
His personal file, I, I don't ask...
(hitting Cynthia playfully with a napkin) Stop it, stop it.
More jokes?
Yeah.
Anyway there was all this tension. I asked her if she wanted to go out to dinner and she said "no, maybe we could get together for lunch." You know what that means.
Oh yeah, al-almost. Almost.
Well, you know. You get to a certain point, you wanna know about your roots.
(pauses to consider this then gives in) All right. (starts heading towards bedroom)
Kramer, Kramer, I need to know if Nina is refunding.
Hey, she wants me to dress uh "smart casual." What uh, what is that?
This bread has nuts in it!
Are they here?
My censor quit two years ago. He checked into a clinic. Emotionally exhausted.
Oh, of course. (motioning Estelle to enter) Of course.
Oh, I had no choice. She squeezed it out of me! Shed tell me she loved me. All right, at first, I just look at her. Id go, Oh, really? Or uh, Boy, thats, thats something. But, eventually you have to come back with, Well, I love you. You know, you can only hold out for so long.
Oh, that's nice.
All right. I'm gonna try givin' them fifty-five dollars each... (to Elaine) What do you think?
Hey, hey, hey! Whats goin on here? (To Jerry) You didnt agree to anything, did ya?
What do you mean, oh no.
Anyway, as I was lying in the puddle, I-I think I may have found a way for us to get Bonds and Griffey, and we wouldn't have to give up that much.
I don't see why's she more self-conscious about that than her toe thumbs.
Well, should I call you later?
No no no no no, this has to be carefully orchestrated. You go to a fancy dinner, flowers...
Yes funny (laughs; hand clap) let's go.
Don't worry, I got it.
(Guessing the look) Stink eye?
Aw c'mon.
So dont finish it.
Why? Did she say something to you about why she broke up with me?
No, he isn't.
(frustrated) No. No, no, no. You're not helping me.
Of course you will. (quick chuckle). You're the best. (with a light fist motion across her chin)
Well...not "out." She's a prisoner.
It's a pot pourri. May I, uh, may I show you the master bedroom? (they leave together)
After dark? Please. At their age, that's like swallowing stun grenades.
All right, I'll tell them my sister died. (Starts fake crying) My poor sister died. She was standing and then she was laughing and then they SHOT her! That's the kind of sick city that we're livin' in. They shoot you for laughing. I must go and comfort my poor family. Jerry, take me home so I can comfort my... my poor family.
(frustrated) Ahh!
No keys. And I been calling the city all day. Course there's not really a number to call if you wanna make a pothole.
(agitated) Well, I, I couldn't come. I, I had to drive my mother to, to the chiropodist.
(laughs-hu) So when're you gonna see her?
Kramer, listen to me. I'm never gonna have a child. If I lose this Frogger high score, that's it for me.
What? The guy asked you to HELP HIM MOVE? Wow.
I left three messages. I can't believe this woman. She has sex with me, leaves ten minutes later then I never hear from her again. What kind of a person does this? I mean, she used me. I feel cheap and violated.
...So, anyway, if you think about it, manure is not really that bad a word. I mean, it's 'newer', which is good, and a 'ma' in front of it, which is also good. Ma-newer , right?
Oh, I don't think you want to do that.
Because, if I'm looking straight ahead, and something enters my field of vision, that's merely a happenstance. (Elaine loudly snaps and unfolds her napkin at the next table to get Russell's attention.)
No kidding?
Oh, boy I was up to four in the morning watching the Omen trilogy.
You wanted to see me, sir?
Keys. I can't find my keys.
(to Jerry) How could we not hear anything? What's with this Russel? What's he doing? (Jerry raises his arms and shoulders like he doesn't know)
Yeah. The thing is, I, uh...I had this little zinger of my own I wanted to try.
Because he's afraid she's gonna get hurt.
Aw c'mon, I'm eating here.
Do you think it would be better if I did?
Ooh yeah, the bags, sure.
Yes!
All right. So, he caught me in a cleavage peek, so big deal. Who wouldn't look at his daughter's cleavage? She's got nice cleavage.
Well I guess that's because I wear boxer shorts.
I've had bedroom naked, I've had walk-to-the-bathroom naked... I have never had living-room naked.
Oh, sure, my Black Hawks jacket. I love my Black Hawks jacket.
Yeah, yeah, me to miss -- I miss.
No.
Ma!
You got less than sixty seconds. That's like dismantling a time bomb. What got into you?
I got two tickets to see "Guys And Dolls".
Kramer put Jerry on the phone.
I'm choking!
(Reflecting on his life gone wrong) This McKigney guy had a few good years.. (To Kramer, bitter) How could you forget to turn off an iron?
(explaining, with lots of hand gestures) Okay, look. We've never worked together on a lie. Now, you don't understand how I work. I have a certain way of working. Jerry and I have worked together a few times. He knows how I work. It's not a personal thing, y'know? We're just trying to come up with the best possible lie. That's what this is all about.
There has got to be some way to get back into Pisano's.
What?
Ah, and I got a date with the sales woman. She's got a little Marisa Tomei thing going on.
No, YOU do!
yeah!
Alright see? We got something there.
No... (takes off his glasses and wipes his eyes with his sleeve)
(Also, over his shoulder) Not me.
Well, uh... come in, come, come in. (frantically clears the couch of newspapers and crumbs)
Sorry I'm late, but look what I found in the Yankee Hall of Pride display case.
Yeah, I hope so. For your sake!
Yes, hello. Party's over. (taking off the suit)
What are you doing?...She had those nuts in her mouth, she just spit them out.
Hello.
What, do you pay him for that?
All right. It's grovel time.
Thank you.
Yeah, my roommate in college.
yeah, time is what he's indicating there..
What, you know Jerry?
I tried to tell you, but you wouldnt listen. No, ho, ho! You were gonna get a deal, huh? Theres no laws in this place. Anything goes! Its Thunderdome!
Reprogram all the buttons, see if he changes them back. You know? The old switcheroo.
Not now.
Nah, I have asthma. (Robin's kid grabs George's leg from under the table, and George struggles.)
Hey.
U-ok. (George closes the window and shoos Elaine off. He opens the door to Monica.) Here you go.
You tellin' 'em about the butler story? Is that beautiful or what? Hey, sorry I'm late. (Looks at Rita) Russell?
My tonsils? Yeah, when I was a kid.
For my hamstring.
Ill be right here.
Duty is *nothing*. It's like sales tax...
Yes! (both laugh) God, I've never felt so alive!
Elaine? It's me, George. (Elaine opens the door.) Hey, sorry to bother you so late. (To Billy) Hey! How ya doin.' (To Elaine) Uh, did you get any of those sponges?
(happy) Oh! Okay.
To spite your parents!
(really animated) Alright, alright. You see? This is why I hate writing with a large group. Everybody has their own little opinions, and it all gets homogenised, and you lose the whole edge of it. I'm going with jerk store! Jerk store is the line! Jerk store! Yess!
So what could I do? I couldn't go through with it. She threatened to kill herself.
Because you called her by the wrong name.
LBJ?
Oh yes, by no means, the mood. Let me know if there's anything I can do to lend support to the mood.
NO!!
I'm sorry about that lock on the liquor cabinet. The combination musta just flown outta my head. It's a mental block.
Wait a second, where are you going?
But in the zoo, you know, they might, put a woman in there with me to uh.. you know, get me to mate.
A few days go by and a call is placed at a time when Sandy is known to be busy at work. Once the initial awkwardness is relieved with a little playful humor, which she [Laura] of course cannot resist, an invitation to a friendly dinner is proffered.
Lesbian wedding. How do they work bride and groom out, what do they flip a coin?
(pleased) Yeah, it is.
Aretha! (points finger at Jerry)
Dad, you really should lay off the 'serenity now' stuff.
Wait a second, wait. Why are we together?
Yeah! You're right.. You're probably right.
Yes. Significant shrinkage.
I didn't say I was Ted Danson.
All right. All right! I'll go.
Alright, just make sure he reserves the good chair for me. Wait, what are you gonna tell him about the clanking noise in the car?
I uh got the first name.
Damn it!
Oh, yeah, sure. Keep your money.
(frantic) I'm calling Jerry.
Fire! Get out of the way!
Pulp can move, Baby! Why didn't you eat a real breakfast?
What a world that would be, if you just could ask a woman what shes thinkin.
Because I kissed her in the meeting. Russell found out, he fired her over the phone. Finally, my stupidity pays off!
Oh, deserve! I don't know if I deserve...I mean...
Fired? Why?
I'm writing.
But she's gonna know that I like her more than she likes me.
Nothing.
He doesn't feel funny.
[to himself] Hey, whatd'ya know? Look at that! A *lesbian* sighting. Oh-ho! My lucky day. They're *so* fascinating. Why is that? Because they don't want us. You gotta respect that...
Hello, friend. Enjoying the flight?
I won fifty bucks! Boy, this is great. Too bad Elaine's not here.
We're perfect. I timed this out so we would pull up at the terminal *exactly* 17 minutes after their flight is supposed to land. That gives them just enough time to get off the plane, pick up their bags and be walking *out* of the terminal as we roll up. I tell you, it's a thing of beauty. I can not express to you the feeling I get from a perfect airport pickup. (starts looking around) What's going on? What are you doing? The Long Island Expressway? What are you getting on the Long Island Expressway for? Do you know what the traffic will be like? This is a suicide mission!
What? I work here.
I could..
Well, we just blew 240 bucks on a wheelchair.
What difference does it make what she looks like?
They wanted to read a Truman Capote book.
I was quoting him. Why would I be insulted? I'm never insulted. You could call me baldy, dump soup on my head. Nothing insults me.
Oh, I had it perfectly timed out the Grand Central, the Van Wyck! You destroyed my whole timing!
(quiet, desperate) Maybe she can get me another picture of man-hands. (calling) Elaine!
I heard your whole conversation.
George! She said George? She remembered my name. (loudly -- to a passing waitress and the rest of the restaurant) Diane DeConn remembered my name. She was the "it" girl!
Yeah. Me too.
Didn't say anything. (They go into Elaine's apartment.)
I swear.
Oh...you're very good.
Ive had a lot of other paranormal stuff happen to me.
I'll take care of this, Danny.
(sarcasm) Hu-hu, like I don't know that? (excitement) My Cousin Vinnie, I love that! I, George Costanza, could be on a date with an Oscar winner! An Oscar winner, Jerry! You know what that's like? It's like if fifty years ago, someone fixed me up with Katherine Hepburn? Same thing!
And, it is all because of that car
What, ... you are making some wisecracks in a night club... wo wo wo. The guy was in game SIX two runs down two outs facing elimination.
I had to listen to a five minute discussion on which one is actually called shmoopy.
I love Juu-uuu-uu-uune!
It's in Detroit though, it's an expensive flight.
Because Im not Latvian Orthodox. Her parents wont let her get involved with anyone who isnt Latvian Orthodox.
There is no problem. . . just a small miscommunication. Whereby you thanked her instead of the person actually responsible for purchasing the big salad.
Duncan Meyers?
All right, Kramer that's it.....( pushes the camera) Hello . English. Does anyone speak English
Listen, you're lucking I'm not asking for a whole refund. (trying to speak quietly) You gave me ladies' frames!
"What day is today?....Aw. ..Tuesday! Damn it. I shouldn't have worked out today. Mr Wilhem has called a big meeting and now I'm gonna be sweating through the whole thing."
Not the point!
Cold? How are you going to do that? You're not one of those guys.
Do you wanna talk about hotels, or do you wanna win some ball games?
Oh!, he he, It was unbelievable
What, is that the one your parents gave you?
If you want.
It's dismissive.
Why?
If you had like five chickens could you tell them apart by just the way they acted? Or would they all just be walking around? Bak, bak, baak, bak? Cause if they have individual personalities Im not sure we should be eaten `em. What's the matter with you?
Yeah, so what? I'm not the only one! (Kramer enters with his quilt.)
Yeah.
Hey, Kramer.
Yesssss.
Well, Jerry, I been thinkin'. I've gotten as far as I can go with George Costanza.
I thought Kramer was watching.
uh Tony? there's not gonna be too many sandwiches
What are you doing? Where do you think you're going?
Come on. Will you stop it.
I am not buying something just to get change.
Excuse me, where are we?
You know, I'm a little nervous.
(identifying it) Wrath of Khan!
I do too. you see that's what we're about . You don't remind me of anyone and we love gum.
So, how was the movie?
Festivus, Sir. And, uh, I was afraid that I would be persecuted for my beliefs. They drove my family out of Bayside, Sir!
Oh no, in and out, I made sure of that. And you'll be happy to know I perused the script and it's met with my approval.
I don't know. Perhaps I can better serve the world this way.
Yeah, but if you still look closely you can see ah, a little bump where the nose use to be. huhuhuhu.
And you met her in an antique store! I don't know how you do it!
Into what?
I'm a bad man!
(clears throat) Maura, I, uh- I want you to know... I-I've given this a lot of thought. I'm sorry, but... we, uh, we have to break up.
Why? Why? 'Cause he's off his rocker! That's why.
Well, you could move in with my parents. (chuckles)
I got rejected by a bald woman. A bald woman rejected me. Heh, you like that one? A woman with no prospects and no *hair*, told me that I wasn't her type. Apparently *baldy* likes a slimmer guy.
Okay.
How nice?
Yes, Id like to report a problem with one of your mechanics.
Oh, the bookstore girl. How's that goin'?
They're all the same. You go, you sit, you eat popcorn, you watch. I'm sick of it.
How do you know?
Hi Amy, I'm George.
No.
Of course he liked it.
Got it.
I didnt say any other bawdy things.
Are you a religious man, sir?
I mean, uh... I had fun ice skating.
Well, go ahead! Do it!
Abort! Abort!
(Embarrassed) That's all I could find. (A moment passes) Would you mind getting the door?
Oohoho...spicy mustard...woohoho, you're hot tonight!
Well, that's really not fair.
9... 1... 1. She said she'd do anything. Hello, police? Uh, yeah listen, we're in the back of a limo in Queens--
You know, my mother used to walk around on our apartment just in her bra and panties. She didn't look anything like you, she was really disgusting, really bad body. If you could imagine uglier and fatter version of Shirley Booth. Remember Shirley Booth from Hazel. Really embarrassing, cause you know I had only mother in the whole neighborhood who was worse looking than Hazel. Imagine the taunts I would hear.
Nothing, I... said it was a little problem.
Yeah, you gotta do it classy (wipes his mouth to his sweater.)
No, I know I don't have to, I want to.
If you dont say anything I will assume its a plane crash.
No, not really. I'm just saying this to you because I like to hear myself talk. Yes, really!
Okay.
I, I, I can't.
Oh, this is huge!
How about the old Spider Man live action show?
But enough about fish, huhuhu. I can discuss other things you know, ah architecture. Huhu. (makes a wide gesture with his arms)
(Still mad a Leslie) Never said goodbye. Goodbye!
Is that Elaine?
(worked up) Wha...You gotta be kidding me?!
It's just we want you to go.
Jerry, figure this out. I'm in the coffee shop, and this beautiful girl I could never even talk to, mistakes me for her boyfriend.
She's not faking!
Can I ask you a question? Would you mind switching seats?
I don't even like to use urinals, always been a stall man.
What if her experience with me *drove* her to it?
(remorsefully) I can't go.
Almost there.
Jerry took the couch back.
So this Anna called me from out of the blue.
Jody let's do this agian real soon (he tends his arms for a hug but she avoids him)
Oh boy..
If I was a different person.
Maybe I'll go down to the track. Put it all on a horse...
Jerry, you came for the big moment.
Hey, Jerry, how was Ithaca?
Good, good day. How was your day?
Im starving! I can feel my stomach sucking up against my spine.
Yeah, my wife couldnt make it today. Shes got something with her mother... Who knows whats going on with her. Dont let any one kid you, its tough.
Yuh. What about physically?
There ya go.
(Unsure) I don't a..
You're spending the weekend with Ellen?
(Not amused with her answer) Eggs are eggs. That is very profound. (laughs; Daphne goes back to reading her paper) By the same token you could say fish is fish. Ha ha ha, I don't think so. (pauses) Listen Dophne
Ohhhh...
What?
Oh. How's she doing?
The table is interference, you know it!
Kramer, what are you doing here?
Really? (Jerry nods his head) Well, what if it doesnt stop? Oh, that I really needed to hear. That helps a lot! All right, just say something. Just start talking. Change the subject. Lets just go, All right? I cant believe were having dinner with Alton Benes.
You saw him. He was fiddling with the engine. God knows what he did there.
What happens if the husband dies after the wife, who brings in the clothing in then?
Alright, I just have to go over to the Ross' apartment and drop off Susan's sunglasses. You'll come with me?
Oh, would ya stop worrying?
Mothers say things. My mother goes babbling on and on like a crazy person.
He mentioned my name?! What did he say?!
No, no. I reached down and there was *nothing* there.
(to passerby) Hey, he-hah. It's June, June.
This is a brand new jacket. Boy this really burns me up, ...
Heh, that's right. See ya later. (Exits.)
A free ticket?
I don't know. They're all very suspicious.
No, it's doing the same thing to someone that they did to you.
It's stuck on a piece of cloth here. I can't get the cloth out.
Thanks.
..Okay.
What's going on? He still wants to have dinner with us?
Well Kramer's not an usher anymore.
You open the door to the car, boom, you walk right into the hospital. Eh, You can't beat that spot. (starts doing a little dance) I am on a roll. I'm just willing these great parking spots.
No, she wasn't on the horse.
And everything else has changed. But toilet paper is exactly the same, and will be so until we're dead.
Oh, no no no. Course not. I got a great name for our kids. A real original. You wanna hear what it is? Huh, you ready?
My in-laws. Oh, my....
So--ah, Kramer. Why'd you ask me out to dinner? (amused) An' why Pomodoro?
WAIT ,WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!!!!.... Where was the tape recorder?
I'm back in business, baby!
Hey, you grew a beard, huh?
Kimbrough.
Lets not forget the radiator. The steam has been on here for ten years. No human can turn this off.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
She hasnt eaten in two days.
(hearing Jerry broke up with Patty) Are you still down in the dumps? Come on. It's just a chick.
This is delicious, Mrs. Ross.
No I can't. I can't die with dignity. I have no dignity. I want to be the one person who doesn't die with dignity. I live my whole life in shame. Why should I die with dignity?
What is Lloyd Braun doing here?
All right! All right. I'll tell you what. How about this? Got the date; March 21st, the first day of spring.
Yeah. No, no, no, wait a minute, I always have tuna on toast. Nothing's ever worked out for me with tuna on toast. I want the complete opposite of on toast. Chicken salad, on rye, un-toasted with a side of potato salad ... and a cup of tea. (laughs)
Ohh, yeahh.
You're right, how did I miss that? (Begins unlocking the door, mutters under his breath) Maybe because it's a crock of shit.
Monica wants me to wear it.
What do you mean?
Well, you see, what happened was...the doctor - the very same doctor that was attending to my late aunt - suffered an untimely stroke, and lost the use of his right hand, so...obviously I was unable to get the death certificate. However, I do have this. (Reaches inside his coat and takes out a Polaroid photo.)
This car out there is taking up, like, three parking spaces.
Maybe we should call her.
(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o!
All I know is I've been going to doctors all my life. What has it gotten me? I'm thirty-three years old. I haven't outgrown the problems of puberty, I'm already facing the problems of old age. I completely skipped healthy adulthood. I went from having orgasms immediately to taking forever. You could do your taxes in the time it takes me to have an orgasm. I've never had a normal, medium orgasm.
Y'know... I could hear you on the other line...
Well, Danielle, (digs in his pocket) we should get going. I got a key made for you.
One left...what a joke.
I do for the bad things.
Coming up.
Never said goodbye. Never apologized. Nothing.
(Takes a few seconds to mull this one over. Shooting Jerry a confused look, he repeats it) "The panties your mother laid out for you"? (Jerry nods) What does that mean?
What is this 'saving movies' thing? Something's playing, you go.
I once told a woman that I really enjoy spending time with my family.
Do ya?
(screaming) Aaahh!!
What for?
You-you sure you never slept with her? (Jerry shakes his head 'no') Perfect.
You're giving me the "it's not you, it's me" routine? I invented "it's not you, it's me". Nobody tells me it's them not me, if it's anybody it's me.
Well, Marisa. See, the thing is... I'm sort of engaged.
What?! Well, what are you doing here?
Hey, I just found twenty dollars! I tell you this, something is happening in my life. I did this opposite thing last night. Up was down, black was white, good was -
Yeah.
Mario's Pizza.
How' you doing?
It's OK.
How could you not know who Bozo the Clown is?
No! (The salesman walks away. He addresses the mechanic through the doors window) Hey! Hey! I see you! That is my Twix! (The mechanic eats the last of the Twix, obviously to make George even more angered. It works) Oh, ha, ha! Ho, ho!
Tell me about it. I went out with this girl last week. First I had to pay for dinner, then--
Yeah, ha ha, It's not the toilets, it's not the toilets. It's something else. Are you ready for this?
You dont like tippy toe?
I don't think it's gonna work out...
What, are you kidding? (Points at the flaws of Jerry's hands) The knuckles are all out of proportion. you got hair over there - where do you get off comparing your hands to my hands?! This is a one-in-a-million hand. (Points to his own hand)
The next thing you know, he'll have you driving him to the airport..
The tag, huh?
That's right, no discount!
Pop! POP!!
Goodbye (exits cab)
Ah ha, Ah ha. You would, wouldn't you?
What about it?
So let's say in her mind she witnessed a pick. Okay, so then what?
Um, excuse me, I - I think you forgot my bread.
Actually, (George flips the book back to the beginning) I'll take these nice glossy ones.
I told her the truth.
Piece of cake; hu.
No, you didn't mention it.
Hey, where you going?
I didn't encourage. No encourage.
(on the speaker) Ya
Oh, I find you so charming. You wuss.
You mean like a bra?
Pouty? I like that.
From China. All the way from China.
I don't know. (George sits down at the table. Kramer enters.)
My whole life has been a complete waste of time, (chuckle)
Watch the arm! Tim, listen, we don't want to bother you, we know you're busy here.
I'm sorry I'm sorry, here's the test. Thanks again for doing this - hhe.
Oh, nothin' much, . . . talkin'. . . . Oh, oh, oh, did I have an unbelievable idea today!
One, two ... three, four.
No, I don't know. Maybe you haven't. You know, not everybody's seen a massage table.
Do you really think so?
Hello, it's Natalie? Yeah, this is a business office but I'm not a business man per se. I'm here working for the people. Yes, I'm causing dissent. Stirring the pot. Getting people to question the whole rotten system.
My dad was a cook during the Korean War. Something very bad happened, ever since you can't get him near a kitchen.
You know, you have to know how to do that. You cant have people shoving their arms into a six-hundred degree oven!
Oh, yeah? Holistic.. that's what I need. That's the answer.
Whoa, whoa, a section?!
What happened? Did he bring it up?
Hey, I am not here for rage. I'm here for revenge.
You know, it was really wrong of you to back out on that deal.
What was the tallest woman you ever slept with?
Drakes?
What are you doing here? I thought you said you hated Isabella's?
Hands a little smelly?
There's elevators all over! It all looks the same.
Really.
The same outfit?
All right. Well, we'll see what happens to you.
I think that's what the back of closets are for.
If youre a spirit, and you can travel to other dimensions and galaxies, and find out the mysteries of the universe, you think shes gonna wanna hang around Drexlers funeral home on Ocean Parkway?
Hey.
Why not?
You know, if it was a regular salad I wouldn't have said anything. But you had to have the BIG SALAD.
Might meet a celebrity.
Yeah!
Uuh, sleepy.
Yeah you did, you classed it up!
(to Mickey) Can't you just switch with another Midget?
Oh. (he stands there)
What d'you mean?
(incredulous) What?
(shocked and angry) You paid that crook?!
I am different, yeah.
Or maybe, she just wanted to go to the Tony's. I tell you what; you ask her out again. No Tony, just Jerry. That way you know it he was her dude or just some dude.
You know I'm enjoying it very much. I think my coworkers are really taking to me.
It's a foreign movie... a *film*, is what it is, actually.
I'd like to be able to get it out.
You know what? It doesn't matter, because I quit!
Hey Kramer.
Yeah. Hey! Hey!
My parents are moving to Florida!
Well, I'm satisfied. Uh...my back is...killing me.
Jon Voight?
That's unbelievable!
Yeah. You like it.
Yeah, when the season starts. Right now, I sit around pretending that I'm busy.
Eee-aaa-eee-aaa-eee-aaa...
You already told me everything.
Hunh, pph (raises hands slightly, in amazement) How was it?
Oh, no. No no no no no. Id have to advise against that. What, do you know this woman a month? Lets see, youre going to be with her seventy-two hours. Thats a dating decathlon.
Only if you buy. I gotta make a sale.
No. I wouldnt even have to tell her. I could surprise her.
Well we were all eating the raisins. And I remember you--you were eating some of the raisins. And then you left, and the raisins were gone. And I was just wondering if, you know (chuckles), maybe you took them with you.
What's her name?
Just because you have someone's spare keys, it doesn't entitle you to break into their apartment. That's the reason you took away Kramer's keys.
Did I need that pointed out for me? What is that going to do for me? How does that help me, to see her? I'm trying to live my life. Don't show me that.
Is he still nuts?
She says we cant go out anymore.
Hey, Elaine. Maybe his girlfriend is Lois Loan.
I didn't know whether to try and keep her from falling, or zip up.
(to various people as he walks in) Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Hi nice to see you. How are you. Good morning. (to the secretary) Good morning.
I got it.
Absolutely...
How's it going?
Well how do you even know its hers? Maybe it belonged to Carol. Did you see a name on the tube?
The catering hall screwed up. The wedding is delayed until June. It's like a stay of execution.
Never mind!
Hi. (waves to Donald and laughs) hahahaha.
What, you are comparing me to Biff Loman, very encouraging. The biggest loser in history of American literature.
What do you mean - "Not letting you?"
Yea... (sinks in) What? No, no!
(quietly) ehh. (pausing to look at both of them) So what made you change your mind?
Yeah, yeah, not fan talk, not gushing, you know? Actual conversation, I was incredibly articulate!
Maybe they're Wilt Chamberlain's.
That's what I want.
Of course it is.
Gennice palying today?
Well the guy's just standing there.
Ah, this is the kind of day that almost makes you feel good to be alive.
Oh, hello, it's you! (angry) Listen lady, I got six minutes left on that meter, and I'm not budging til you admit you stole my twenty dollars. (smug) Huh-hu-hur, you're not so tough when you're not on your horse, are you Ruthie?
I would like to dip my bald head in oil and rub it all over your body. [No reaction] You don't understand! It's a miracle! You don't understand because you don't speak English!
What?
I think.
Well, that interests me very much Mr. Farkus.Very much indeed, sir.
It just came to me.
Everything goes with naked.
Yeah. Good weekend.
Can you believe it? It's happening! It's finally happening! I'm free!!
You can't do that, it's none of your business!
Ill eh, Ill just have a bowl of chili.
Yes! I mean, if she thinks that's me she's under a complete misapprehension. That was not me, Jerry. That was not me.
So we'll do it tomorrow.
Come on. Come on.
Who says?
What signal? What-what signal?
What? Why couldn't you think of something?!
A decent hotel-room...
I dont know whatcha had to tell her that for. You put me in a very difficult position, Marine Biologist! I'm very uncomfortable with this whole thing.
No! No!
Who would Want to. She tried to end it with me, Jerry.
Dr. Sitarides don't go! Oh, thanks Jerry!
In this scene my co-star who's right over here ( goes over to George who is still on the phone) Follow meeeee... is George Costanza, he plays an airline pilot who's just returned from Rome and I'm about to show him how much I've missed him.
What, to see the old guy?
Aah! Fire!
What?
What happens to charter tickets when you don't use em?
Alright.
I just don't think it's such a great idea for you to sit here.
Yeah, I told her how toilet paper hasn't changed in my lifetime, and probably wouldn't change in the next fifty thousand years and she was fascinated, fascinated!
Yeah, yeah, the flower guy. Listen, I know this all sounds a little crazy, but...
Oh my God! What is that?!
Yes, inte-- h-how inte-- how integral?
Who are you to play God!? Every man's time comes! If his number is up, who are you to interfere!?
...neither am I.
I didn't burn it down - Kramer did!
How does Tim Whatley even know Newman?
They were, it's kinda complicated.
Alright, thanks a lot.
So, you want to come down to Mario's Pizza with me and help me pick up the Frogger?
I know.
Hey! George and Janet.
Yeah, just like I do.
I get the feeling when lesbians are looking at me, they're thinking "That's why I'm not heterosexual".
Elaine, get off the speaker! (Elaine picks up phone)
What are these? (Holds test tubes to his head like antennae) Take me to your leader.
Well, a lot of people keep popcorn in the house.
No.
Shhh! Listen, you gotta do me a favor. Give me your wallet. I'll give it back to you later.
Little baked beans
You ask me here to have lunch, tell me you slept with Elaine, and then say you're not in the mood for details. Now you listen to me. I want details and I want them right now. I don't have a job, I have no place to go. You're not in the mood? Well you get in the mood!
You'll pay? I'm there.
Theres just no justice. This experience has changed me. Its made me more cynical, more bitter, more jaded.
It's the pesto of cities. So..?
I think that's a good sign.
Okay. Hey, you know what, maybe I should give it to my therapist to read. She's smart, I trust her.
In the whole world right now, there's maybe three emergencies. Why would you think, on this entire planet, that you're one of those three?
Nice nun.
He left perfect imprints.
All right, do you mind? I have the window! (To Willie) Now, what are you gonna do about my Twix?
You've never seen this before?
Hey, they can't go, "Hey! You look fabulous!"
No, no, I mean, driving Susan to lesbianism.
Say you go to the bathroom at two o'clock in the morning, what's the outfit? I mean, you dressing up or is it come as you are?
I dont understand why you spend time with this guy.
Well, she's smart. You take my word for it.
Hey! (heads toward bathroom)
Officer, could I just explain something to you?
Fitted Hat Day! That's what you asked Steinbrenner for?
Well, maybe so...but it was good enough for Mr. Jon Voight.
Oh I missed the Maestro?
Yeah?
I gotta find a way to work this out, I love that apartment. It's so cozy, I'm ensconced in velvet. You know, if it were socially acceptable--
Have a good time.
Dont insult me, my friend. Remember who youre talking to. No ones a bigger idiot than me.
Alright, alright, I'll call Heather, you'll get your hat back, I will get a second date. Ha ha ha. Now watch the magic.
What was that line again? Something about finding your way in a shadow?
Well, aren't you something?
Thanks. Gee, you know, I thought you were mad at me.
I have no power Do you understand? I need hand. I have no hand.
KHAN!
Uh, I'm just selling some of Dad's things, (looking into Kramer's eyes) that's what he would have wanted.
All right, let me just... I'm gonna grap an apple.
(neither does he) Yeah, well.
If she'd just take a plane somewhere.
See? This looks right to you, doesn't it?
(ahem) In this age of uncertainty and confusion, a man begins to ask himself certain questions. How can one even begin to put into words something so um (trying to think of a word)
Ooooo, I'm scared. . . . Ohoooo they're not going to do the show.
No, they had plans.
What time is it?
Can we go now?
Alright, very good, very good...go fold your little balloon animals, Eric. Eric! (chuckles) What kind of name is that for a clown, huh?
What are you doing?
Uh no no, shes working.
You told her? How could you tell her? I told you not to say anything.
What about this leftover Chinese food?
Not a bad way to make a buck.
He never finished the sentence. He got a call, that was the end of the interview.
Oh. Oh. Yeah, sure. Here. Uh, sit down. Uh, uh, cheese, there? (he grabs a suit jacket from the desk chair and puts it on)
Oh yes, Mr.Wilhelm, yeah...
Very curious.
It's "Guys And *Dolls*", not "Guys And *Guys*".
Here we go.
Yes, you have to be Murphy.
Eh, gee, I hope you have the key for these things.
Well it was a helluva yada yada.
Just walk.
Why do you have to be so suspicious of every one. This is a great man Zeng Zau, he wants to help bald people.
Yeah, well, she's trying to track you down.
I-I guess it can't hurt him... People eat *pounds* of those things.
Jerry. I can't get fired.
Actually, I never had any formal training. I guess I'd be better suited for improvs, or something..
(to Jerry) You're very special.
I know, swan dives from twenty floors up, lands right on top. What do I got a bulls eye up there? He couldn't move over two feet? Land on the sidewalk. It's city property.
Listen Sheila it's not what you think. I put my trust into the wrong person. He said the key word was tasteful.
All the way?
You see, you see? I see things as they are and I say, 'no!' Uh, wait, you see things as they are not and you s- Wait, uh, you see things, do you see things as they are? What do you say when you see things?
Kramer, what the hell are you talking about?
Come on let's get out of here.
'Scarsdale surprise'. That's the musical about that Scarsdale diet doctor murder.
Is that right? I just threw away a lifetime of guilt-free sex, and floor seats for ever sporting event in Madison Square Garden. So please, a little respect. For I am Costanza Lord of the Idiots!
(to Jerry) Have you seen the waitresses in there lately? I never had so much coffee in my life.
She's like a district attorney. If it's not the truth, I'll break under the cross. I actually have to do it.
I think I can still catch her.
I wanna go to a tractor pull.
Oh, it's the chicken and the egg...
I been, uh, thinking about the family. Tell me, uh, about Aunt Baby.
Yeah, I saw it.
(singing) Lemon tree, very pretty and a lemon flower...
I think she wants me to take her home.
Wow, just felt your material?
Oh, Huh, imagine that.
(on tape, singing) "Believe it or not, George, isn't at home, please leave a mes-saaage at the beep. I must be out or I'd pick up the pho-one. Where could I be? Believe it or not, I'm not hooome." (beep)
Whad you do that for?
That's exactly what I told Jerry!
Yeah, me too...
I just wanted to talk to Tony for a minute (hands Elaine some stuff)
It's the real deal.
That's why the world's in the shape it's in.
Okay, uh, eighteen dollars, and there it is. There you go. So maybe we could get together this weekend.
Really? Who?
I tell you something. I wish there were pig-men. You get a few of these pig-men walking around suddenly I'm looking a whole lot better. Then if somebody wants to fix me up at least they could say, "Hey he's no pig-man!"
Hey, I brought you some cigarettes. You buy yourself something nice.
Oh, wait, isn't scalping illegal?
How could you do that?!
Loves bald? (laughs) Wow. Who uh, who is she?
Well a lot of people consider me small and prestigious.
(pointing at Jerry) Oh, hes the comedian.
Yeah and you get this really cool T-shirt when you sign on..
(excited, pushing Jerry forward) All right, let's go, let's go, let's go, come on.
(Germanic) Ich bin ein sucker.
Yeah...(scratching his head) full.
Eighteen dollars.
Oh really. You tell her you shaved it?
I got a big problem here, Jerry. The tapes are worthless.
It just didnt work out. What can I do? I wanted to love her. I tried to love her. I couldnt.
You know what the temperature in Florida is today? Eh? Seventy-nine. That's almost eighty. Yeah, I read someplace the life expectancy in Florida is eighty-one and in Queens, seventy-three.
(To Jerry) Jerk off.
he's the first cool guy I've ever been friends with in my whole life. You know.. it's a different world when you're with a cool guy, he's not afraid of anybody. You should hear the way he talks to waitresses.. he gets free pie!
(not happy delivering Elaine's lie) Well, he uh, he wants to uh, quit the exporting and uh, focus just on the importing. And it's a problem, because she thinks the exporting is as important as the importing.
Thank you very much. You just stand over there, I?ll stand over here.
(wondering where this is leading) No sir.
Is it? (reaches into bag)
Right!
...Why?
What did you go out with me for?! Just to dump chocolate on my shirt and then just dump me altogether?! I don't deserve that kind of treatment! What, you don't have the common courtesy to return my calls?! To apologize! You think I'm some sort of a loser, that likes to be abused and ignored?! Who's shirt can be ruined without financial restitution?! Some sort of a masochist who enjoys being humiliated? You think you can avoid me like I have some sort of disease?! You have the disease! You have the disease! You may be beautiful and rich and physically .. just .. unbelievable, but you sicken me! You disgust me! You and everyone like you!
You couldn't figure out the World's Theory for yourself? It's just common sense. Anybody knows, ya gotta keep your worlds apart. (gesturing with hands going outward)
Oh! Nuts! Excellent! You know what I love? How there's two nuts named after people. Hazel...and filbert.
Is that right?
This is very hard to follow with all the talking.
Oh, its from Les Miserables. I went to see it last week. I cant get it out of my head. I just keep singing it over and over. It just comes out. I have no control over it. Im singin it on elevators, buses. Im singin it in front of clients. Its taken over my life.
You got that from Elaine.
A scar?
I'm just gonna...wash. (George walks to the bathroom; screaming) WHY DID I PUT UP TWO? WHY DID I PUT UP TWO?
What are you doing?!
Why doesn't *he* pick you up after the operation. He's got the car with the bench seats that you like.
Yeah!
Oh, I pleaded with him.
(Trying to keep his voice down) I think you've done a lot more than talk! You betrayed me!
Pepe.
Brown.
*I* think that *you* think that a certain *something* is not all that it could be, when in fact it is is all that it *should* be, and *more*!
Magic time.
You are!
Right.
It.
Did I get him in trouble? Because of what I said?! I just told him what happened.. he didn't do it on purpose.. (Mangager and busboy are arguing. The busboy points in the direction of George) He pointed at me. Why did he point at me?!
It's not him!
Hey believe me, baldness will catch on. When the aliens come, who do you think they're gonna relate to? Who do you think is going to be the first ones getting a tour of the ship?
(Sarcastically) What's the competition, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang?
This is like a Penthouse letter...Why can't I meet women like this?
Yes! Yes, all right--anything!
(Gloating) Hey, you got any extra furniture down there? I need some more stuff to fill that extra bedroom with the walk-in closet. (Smiles)
Bye-bye.
I'd love to be a Civil War buff. ... What do you have to do to be a buff
Me too. I've been yelling at strangers on the street.
Alright. Uh, well, I'm out of here. (Gets up to leave)
ahhhhh (exhaling) Jerry, my young friend, you're so nave. You are so, so nave. You know about a few things. You know about comedy, a little bit about relationships, some baseball, but you are so far out of your element here, you are embarrassing yourself. Now listen to me. I'm negotiating. Negotiation, this is what'cha do in business.
Well, it wouldn't fit you. The sleeves are too short.
You what?
Yea bye.
But, but I'm disturbed! I'm depressed! I'm inadequate! I got it all!!
Besides, Steven Koren has the highest of aspirations. He wants to be (pauses for effect) an architect.
I insist. Ill fix us a drink. (phone rings  who would that be?) I got it.
I do.
(from bathroom) VANDELAY, SAY VANDELAY!
Hey hey hey, we're in a rush here.
Huh, he's a communist. . . . Look at this. "Exciting uninhibited woman seeks forward thinking comrade and appearance not important." . . . Appearance Not Important! This is unbelievable. Finally this is an ideology I can embrace.
I don't know.
You go over there -
Flame on!
Hmm. What about a hole? You ever put anybody in "the box"?
Yeah, I never know what's going on there.
It's me.
(smug) Ah, I guess I showed Neil who's Neil.
Ooh ho hoo, forget it.
(sitting down) Vacation?
Alright, alright! (Goes out onto the sidewalk. The Seinfelds walk by) Seinfelds!
Well, I told it to Susan before, and she didn't like it.
Yes.
Hello.
You think she's happy?
Maybe it's got something to do with that 42 in the corner .
Well, at the Yankees it was all about smoothing things over, you know, chiseling away, grinding down. In fact we used to call it 'the grind'.
Not yet. Oh! Ho ho! God...
You'll have your turn! The truth must be heard. (Plays back the tape.) That's all there was. And yet, it speaks volumes. A low rumple. A metallic 'squink.' A 'glonk.' Someone crying out..."Dear God!" Let's start with, uh...with you, Wyck.
I never heard him say anything really funny.
So she doesn't like me?
Should I leave this..?
Oh, you're in here.
If this lip reading thing works tonight do you know how incredible this is going to be? It's like having Superman for your friend.
Uh, well, you know,...
(To Carl) Oh, by the way, order anything you want, it's all on me. Just do me a tiny favor pretend we're old friends. Oh my God! Mr. Morgan! What a coincidence, it's Mr. Morgan. Mr. Morgan, I want you to meet a dear old friend of mine, Carl.
Well, not really. After all, she did get together with George Peppard. I mean, Fred.
Wow. Excuse me, Miss?
And you! How many Twix does that make for you, today?! Like, 8 Twix?!
Damn you, laser guy! You had to grab it all with your lowbrow laser shtick! You're just a prop comic! Where's the craft?!
Let me ask you something. Could you tell if teeth marks on someone's arm matched teeth marks on a pencil?
So?
Is he dead?
You know I uh, spilled a yogurt smoothie in here two days ago. Hm, Can't smell anything, can ya?
What?
...And exporter.
There's nothing I can even impart to you, that's the sad thing. It's so inborn, I can't pass it on. (begins backing into the space) Look at this guy. Are you crazy, what are you doing?! Hey! Hey, you're stealing my space!
I mean, she's beautiful, right? She's just my type. The dark hair, the full lips.
Just the last few innings of a double-header.
You are gonna love this car. Even if you don't like Jon Voight.
Yeah, he did.
(attacking Kramer) How could you give me a defective condom?!
Because of society, right?
Only I hold the answer key to their true candy identities. And so, without further ado, I give you the candy line-up. (Opens a door to a back room. Various dealership employees are munching on candy bars)
Heads!
Because I promised her.
Yes, sir. Yes sir, do my best.
Have to give him time on this hour.
Oh, you lying little snot. And he's a cheater. Aren't ya' you little twerp?
I've got to tell you, I'm really disappointed in Lupe.
What's that?
It was you!
Why d'you think I'm going now?
Hello, oh, hello. You remember, ... Susan, from N B C.
That's not the point. The point is I was here first.
Pssh. Would the protg pick up stuff for the mentor?
March 21st. Hey! So, you're gonna back me on this, right?
Call the Embassy.
(shrugs and lights it up)
No everything is *not* going good. I'm very uncomfortable. I have no power. I mean, why should she have the upper hand. *Once* in my life I would like the upper hand. I have no hand-- no hand at all. She has the hand; I have *no* hand...
Boy, you look really great.
Yeah. What are you doing with the Daily Worker?
I'm a man. Jerry, I'm a man. And do you know why? It's because of that talk we had. You were my inspiration. Do you believe it? You. That lunch was the defining moment of my life.
No, he said there was nothing he could do, and next time I should probably break the Prozacs in half.
Oh, its a lovely song. (singing) How do you solve a problem like Maria?...
George?
You had to hop! You had to hop on the plane.
Don't go. Kramer! Come back. I got great news. Well, I did it.
Well? (Miranda hits George) I was just - I'm curious, that's all. We, uh. We'd like you to, do everything possible.
Danielle. Where's Neil? (indicating the bed) Is this him?
Listen. I want you guys to send along those agreements the minute you land. Our boys can't wait to kick your butts!
Oh my God...You're in jail? (Celia nods.) That is so cool!
She wants me to take an IQ test.
Hey! Wow, the K-Man! (They walk into the kitchen inside)
Uncle Leo's having regular sex?
You know what you should do? You should tell this guy you're seeing somebody else. That's the easiest way to get out of these things.
Could she do that at Kruger?
No difference. I could care less. She's Jerry's girlfriend.
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. All right. I don't think we're gonna have any problem with that. (chuckles nervously) Good talking to you Tom. Really.
So I still haven't heard about that job.
Ladies and gentlemen, this (Opens the door, Steven is standing there) is Steven Koren. His G.P.A. is a solid 2.0! Right in that meaty part of the curve - not showing off, not falling behind.
I still don't see why I can't ask her about my arm.
Aunt Baby.
Ho ho ho ho! I can't wait for Hanke to come crawling back to me.
This is great!
So I'm dressing and she's staring up at me, struggling to compute this unprecedented turn of events. I don't know what to say to reassure this woman, and worst of all, I don't have the time to say it. The only excuse she might possibly have accepted is if I told her I am in reality Batman, and I'm very sorry, I just saw the Bat-Signal. It took me 3 days of phone calls to get her to agree to see me again. Now she's waiting for me to call her, and she's
All right, I think they have fleas there. So what...
Wa, uh, ...
I like to stop at the duty free shop.
Sounds like a scam. (takes a bite from the granola bar)
I was, I had to leave. She lit some vanilla incenses. The smell drove me nuts, all I could think about was food, I had to get out of there. We need some pudding here! Pudding!
You know what? I think this Ruthie Cohen gave me the wrong change. Didn't I pay with a twenty? I'm sure I paid with a twenty.
What are you talking about?
I don't know, I don't know, you'll think of something.
We need to talk.
I mean, you've seen her, right?
And I love you, Marisa.
Then afterwards maybe we could all go out together. Y'know she'll see me with my friends, she'll observe me as I really am, as myself. Maybe I can get some hand that way.
(sighs) She called Susan last night.
You idiots. You're gonna wear down the battery.
Oh great.
I know!
You see what just happened here?
Oh, sure. I mean, after all, you were almost my, uh... OK, I gotta go.
It was a fat camp. Those kids depended on me.
First she screams, "George, what are you doing?! My God!" And it looked like she was gonna faint - she started clutching the wall, trying to hang onto it.
(whispering) I can't explain. It's very important that I sit here.
All right. Shh! I gotta focus. I'm shifting into soup mode.
I hear thee.
Oh, no...no, that's very bad for the kidneys.
I, ... am breaking up with, ... you.
What was that all about?
Well, I started to tell her and then all of the sudden, for some reason, I just burst into tears.
Oh yeah.. (Starts to open it) Sally called Susan - said you guys really hit it off.
And you don't have to pay.
I dont know, what were doin here, this is ridiculous.
Fantastic?
Yeah, and I - I heard you got on their good side. Now, what'd you do?
Well you know there is an unusual number of people in this country having sex with AMPUTEES! (grabs the forum from Kramer and walks over to the clerk) . . . Penthouse forum, newspaper, gum, Clark Bar.
I mean, I could understand if there was something else playing, but it's this or nothing.
I-I don't get these birds! They're breaking the deal. It-it's like the pigeons decided to ignore me!
You said you grabbed it outta there real fast, right?
Its amazing. We, we both have dates on the same night. I cant remember the last time that happened.
So, I could do that?
Don't you see. She's looking at my pictures.
Yea they're making Paella.
Good thinking!
A vet?
Oh, this isn't even B.O.! This is *beyond* B.O.! It's *B*.B.O.!
(Thinking to himself) She's not concerned about the security guard. What kind of a person is this? I'm marrying a person who doesn't care that this man has to stand here 8 hours a day when he could easily be sitting.
Now my parents are gonna know I had people over.
That's unbelievable.
Can she talk?
But it's not a photograph, I need a photograph!
What checks?
(shouting) Turn your key, Maura. Turn your key!
Listen, I have a tremendous favor to ask.
Yeah?
It's effeminate to sit like this?
Lyndon Johnson was uglier than Degaulle.
Hey, theres Kramer & Darren.
The nice one that works in my office.
Willie. Yeah.
Youre doomed. Youre gonna have to have all your sex at womens apartments. Itll be like a permanent road trip. Forget about the home bed advantage.
(adamant) Yes I am. I defy you to come up with a better name than Seven.
Hold on. Hold on. Wait a minute. How am I gonna get the rye bread into the apartment?
Oh, please, somebody, stop this!
No, no that can happen. Ive, uh, Ive read about that in medical journals. Its a freak thing, but...
(hesitant) Uh, Mr Wilhelm. Uh, about the project...
No, no, this wasn't moving on. I got the hook. I wish I could get a lesson in that.
Well, I can't crack this one.
(spins his chair back to face her) So you got a $25,000 a year raise.
Maybe I could just use the bathroom.
Well, me neither.
Like what? I'm bald? What is it specifically? Is, is there an odor I'm not aware of?
God bless you.
What did you have?
I'm a college graduate. You want me to be a mailman?
Those nachos are killing me.
I needed it! My back is... a little tweaked.
We could be zipping all over the place.
Yeah.
Huh. (Makes a "over his head" gesture with his arm) C'mon, let's go, go. We got a lot of work to do today.
No wait, you can't just leave me here! Will I see you again?
Get out!
Who?
You know we're living in a society!
Hurry up.
Eh, they're trying to pick out a new couch - you don't want to know. (Remembering the watching Van Buren Boys) Give me your wallet, or I'll spill your guts right here on the street!
Hi! Mr. West, this is my friend Elaine--
Well let me hear....( they struggle for the headphones)
Brother Costanza will be taking the vow of silence.
I know someone wholl do it. Shes good. Shes honest.
Yes.
Oh, yeah. You wish you had this coat.
And I always take care of my Pisano's. So here is a little something. (drop in tip and worker looks the other way, so George decides to take it out and try again only to get caught)
Can't be done.
Well, they're obviously not here.
How do women know about shrinkage?
Me too.
If youre having second thoughts, if you didnt want it, dont worry about it because uh, you know, I, I...I could take it, you know.
Maybe I could be a land guy.
All right, uh, okay, I got it, um, Ill sing.
Alright, tell her. Go ahead.
Oh.
How ya doing?
kissed me. We both had tears streaming down our faces. I never saw anyone so beautiful. It was at that moment that I decided to tell her that, I was not a marine biologist.
Nobody's faking.
I think it moved.
Eh...come oooon...(starts stabbing the paper with the pen. Mr. Wilhelm comes in)
I'm baby-sitting! Vivian asked me to raise him if she doesn't make it.
Kramer, there's a guy out here that...
Did she do it on purpose?
Yeah, so you gotta use something else.
Like retouched.
Good.
(indicating the window) Kramer, it's, it's raining. They got the tarp on the field.
Hey, who's talking to you?
Please. (sits again)
Chaperone? What, are you kidding?
All right. Don't change me. Susan. Don't change me. Ya know there are a lot of woman that would love to be in your position right now.
You just said you weren't tucking.
Weren't you supposed to call Elaine?
What's so funny?
Wait, as a matter of fact, wasn't there some guy in your building that you said you liked? He lived up on the fifth floor or something.
Oh, sure. (Holds the box out as Susan takes out a few letters)
All right. You understand now? It's not that complicated.
I think he was impressed.
Hey.
Look...
Oh you can stuff your sorries in a sack, Mister!
Aw! Funny he's a funny guy.
That's David Letterman. I just saw David Letterman walk by. I'll be right back. (He exits)
Im aware of you. (to Jerry) All right, lets go (opens the bathroom door) Lets go!
Nine sixty? Give it to me.
Alright, stop it Kramer, you're freakin' me out. (The waitress comes over.)
That's a myth.
Her back went out. She's gotta be there for a couple of days. All she said on the way over in the car was, "Why, George, why?!".. I said, "Because it's there!"
It wasn't down in, it was sort of on top.
Whew! Boy, it's cold outside, huh? Oh, these New York winters, huh. Bitter cold, bitter.
It's the same menu.
Kramer, don't be fooling around up here.
I think they really went for that Soda.
Right, ready?
I don't.
That's a picture of me next to the coffin.
( mouth full) Hi, this is fantastic ( puts the pit in the a plate)D'you ever had a Macanaw peach?
(Heavily sarcastic. He's angered at Jerry) Good one. Very funny. You're very funny, Jerry. That's what I always tell people. (Yelling out) Jerry Seinfeld's a funny guy!
You nervous?
Then, I'm at The Foundation...
Well what about all the Lloyd Braun sales?
Right now?
She wasn't flirting with you.
Yeah.
Well, I heard a noise.
I looked up. I couldn't believe it.
She never came back from lunch.
I believe strongly in that as you know.
...velay.
(Yelling from the bathroom) Don't tell her anything, she'll kill me!!
.........What's that?...
No, no....(mumbles)
A mental institution.
I tried to tear it from the side, you can't get a good grip here. You gotta do it like a bag of chips.
I tell you; I'm wiped.
Busy. Don't give me busy. Who's not busy? I'm busy, we're all busy, everybody's busy. All right, tell me, what's kept you so busy?
(gleeful) Hehee. W..we could be like the Gatsbys. Didn't they always like, you know, a bunch of people around, and they were all best friends?
Oh, the hamstrings fine.
What did I get or what do I say I got?
Oh yeah, everybodys guy is the best.
Did you buy this for me?
Jerry, look at my eyes.
Elaine, this pilot...it doesn't matter to me, it's not me I'm concerned about...it's my mother. I've been over to the hospital to see her...
..And I went down there one time to see...
Jerry, its not my fault.
There could be more than one O'Brien on a plane who ordered a limo.
Well, there could be.
I don't know why Rachel had to drive back with Michael and Carol.
Yes.
What? Oh, My God!
(picking up his coat) Awright, I'm heading home.
What, like at a bus stop?
Yes! How're we gonna do that?
So what, he's got a couple of good jokes.
For you.
(Impersonating Carson) I didn't not know that. Weird. Wild. (Susan and George both laugh)
All right -- (Gets up to leave)
What do you need her for? There's a million lawyers.
Of course you can.
No, I saw "Home Alone II".
Its over.
Alright I happen to know what they did last night, they had dinner with Kramer.
I was there! I saw a drain!
I might.
Who gets picked off in softball? Its unheard of.
What is this? This is a drawing.
What's with this guy?
So? Movie tonight?
3 days.
No, but Im very uncomfortable.
I've been to a few of em. If you uh start to get woozy later, which is quite common, stay close to me. I'll get you through it. (chuckles)
What for?
You're going back to New York now?
Listen, Buck, I uh...obviously I don't need to talk to you about the importance of player morale, but uh...I've been talking to some of the guys, and some of them - I don't want to mention any names - but some of them...they're not too happy with the polyester uniforms.
That's right.
Maybe it's some small thing I could change. Like a moustache. Or wearing a top hat, or a monocle, or a..or a cane.
Im fine.
Susan's college roommate.
Here we are.
I cant believe I won at Inka-dink.
What if I want to walk around a little?
But I have to have them by one o'clock. He's very regiment about his meals.
They made me buy it.. A hundred bucks this thing cost me. (Gesturing to the book) How dare they?! I got news for you, if it wasn't for the toilet, there would be no books.
Nah, I don't like that one.
It's MOOPS.
Bone marrow.
I calculated my odds of ever getting together with a Portuguese waitress. Mathematically, I had to do it, Jerry.
Who's that?
Really? (feeling flattered)
I made a mistake.
See now that bothers me even more than dying bothers me, cause it's people like you who live to be a hundred and twenty because you're not bothered by it. How could it not bother you?
They said tomorrow, maybe.
Yeah, yeah.
Lobster.
What're you doing? What're you, telling secrets? What're you laughing at?
(Resenting the fact. Nodding) I am aware.
Heh he, I made it.
(clears his throat)
Oh, I wanted to talk to you--I'm sorry, I--didn't know you... (re Donna) had company. (Jerry indicates he should stay) Hiya, I'm George.
uh.. maana? huh maana might.. huh maana might be a problem, I'm supposed to have huh a boil lanced maana. Huh you know I think they charge me if I cancel with only one maana's notice
No! Get out of here, Newman.
Oh, uh...it's George.
I can't sell the book. It's been marked.
I used to share that same outlook. But now, I have so many things to occupy my mind. For instance, the atom.
What is that, immigrants come over, you show them how to act natural?
I'm the opposite of every guy you've ever met.
He'll be back on Monday.
Because of the day before. It's a long story.
C-Communist? I am a Yankee, sir, first and foremost.
What?
Come on, Kramer.
Huh?
You are not gonna believe whats going on with this woman.
I-I don't know.
She said no.
Alright, just keep the hat!
Elaine.
Aw, come on. I wanna go see him.
(laughs) hu hu.
Be careful, you're getting blood all over the car.
Nucleosis.
They? The Government?
Give 'im the jacket already!
This guy's giving me the stare-ahead.
I can't do these puzzles.
Oh, every chance I get.
About six years ago.
It's something . It's hope.
I don't even think she'd notice it. Can you see it?
Its uh, it's only a few blocks.
Sure, well uh, you know I'll check in with you next week uh, I gotta run now because I got a full plate this afternoon. All right, really go to uh,.
I'm just happy to be working with your talented son...
Because he made a big deal about how I understand everything immediately. That's what impressed him.
(Nodding, writing) "How's it going?"
All right. (throws his coat back down on the seat and sits down opposite them)
Well it's over. It's definitely over.
Whats in it?
Okay.
I wanna bite into a big hunk of cheese, just bite into it like it's an apple.
(shaking his head, weary) It doesn't matter. (he leaves)
What's with all these flags?
(to the saleswoman) You know honey for an unadvertised sale, you're doing a lot of yapping about it.
All my life I've dreamed of sitting front row, behind the dugout!
Yes, for a sales position. Latex salesman, the selling of latex, and latex related products. They just wouldn't give me a chance.
No, Ill put half a can of mousse in my head like you.
No, thanks.
Yeah, yeah I really had some guts back then. Why don't we do it again?
Celia? W-w-what are you doing here?
I forgot to ask you; how did the revenge date go?
Can't we discuss this?
You wanted to see me, sir?
Are you through?
The name's George Constanza. I'm starting work here today. I was wondering if you could tell me where my office is.
Nobody tucks anymore.
Kramer, what's the name of the store with the mannequin?
This is George Costanza, I'm calling for my test results. Negative? Oh, my God. WHY! WHY! WHY? What? What? Negative is good? Oh, yes of course! How stupid of me. Thank you. Thank you very much. (he hangs up)
What do you mean you will? That's a bad idea. Jerry is a very private person.
Five hundred dollars, that?s a great deal!
Well, I gotta go back there and try again. Hi Sheila.
Well, it's this little place with this little bathroom. It's like right there, you know, it's not even down a little hall or off in an alcove. You understand? There's no... buffer zone. So, we start to fool around, and it's the first time, and it's early in the going. And I begin to perceive this impending... intestinal requirement, whose needs are going to surpass by great lengths anything in the sexual realm. So I know I'm gonna have to stop. And as this is happening I'm thinking, even if I can somehow manage to momentarily... extricate myself from the proceedings and relieve this unstoppable force, I know that that bathroom is not gonna provide me with the privacy that I know I'm going to need...
It's not the money!
No-no-no, Kramer. Kramer! Kramer! You *cannot* abandon people in the middle of an airport pickup! It's a binding social contract. We... we must go forward... not back.
And then I took my pants off.
This uniform, what's it made from?
Hello, Lloyd. How you doing?
Your friend is been accused of being a serial killer. I think that qualifies.
Oh ah, I uh, will have that for you by after lunch.
Wa..Wait.Wait!......Who is this woman?
Oh, Im crazy!
Hnh. That's nerve...
You think the person you were talking to is him? That's not even close to him. He's funny, Jerry's funny.
SEVEN AND FIVE EIGHTHS!!
Alright, bye.
I like to stop at the duty free shop!
(Eating) Oh yeah. These are fantastic, fantastic. (To server) You know, I'd love to get a jump on the next batch, where do you come out? (Server leaves) (To Anna) She's been ignoring this section all night. Quesadilla?
Why'd I think it was timbre? Yeah, she could do voiceover commercials, why didn't you tell me about her voice?
Cut it.
What is this thing doing here?
Like us. (Elaine enters)
You're not letting him win. He wins till you're forty.
(Looks at her) Yeah, uh, no menus. (Waves her off)
Whatever. Believe me, if I wasn't involved right now, I wouldn't mind being set up. Something tells me she's a knockout. (we see, from the camera inside the cab, George's hand waving as the cab drives away)
You stole the bread?
All right, come on, come on, let's go. Six dollars.
We'll just take a check. (She leaves the check. George, in all his cheapness, can't help but to review the check. He finds an error) You made a mistake on the..
Ask her about Kramer.
I didn't do nothin'.
rush? you want a rush? drop a ball on your toe my friend, talk about a rush, you'll be throbbing, you'll see visions
I can't park in a garage.
Yeah. (Jerry nodding) ... Oh, you think because of what I said about the manure. I wa, wa, was just saying how it takes a negative thing, and puts it on a positive spin on it.
You didn't ask him?
No.
Too good...
I don't even know what they think. That's why I'm in therapy.
Oh uh hi Hi, David
What kind of plastic do you think it is? What do you think like that dry cleaning plastic?
Are you kidding me? [Elaine walks past the window glancing in] This is the best tool we have today of measuring a persons' intelligence.
I guess... (chuckles) today shes late.
Yeah, I think, you know, she was, like, crying, and he was consoling her, and then, she, uh, just got into his car, and they just drove away.
Did you pass your stone yet?
I dont know. But I dont. Im actually almost happy to hear it.
How good looking?
Another job?
Im okay. Im fine. Im wonderful. I never felt better in my whole life.
Took a shot.
I had to give it to the liquor store guy.
You don't know what that spot means to him. Once he gets it, he doesn't go out for weeks.
Where were you?
How as the date?
Of course it's cashmere.
Well, you never know. (picks up more shrimp) Let's see how many I can fit in my mouth.
Well have you got a picture?
She'll open!
So I saw that new movie about the Hindenburg.
Yeah, maybe. (snifs)Where'd you get that?
I, uh...figure it's something. (Kramer enters.)
Oh you mean face down on her chest.
It's a big flat noodle.
Oh, well, a mantel's a whole different story.
Well, I guess I'm getting older.
I- I'm pretty sure I left it eh, behind the cushion of the chair ... accidentally.
Oh, that's me.
So...
Fine. Excellent. Could you do me a favor? Could you not tuck the blankets in? 'Cause I can't sleep all tucked in.
Why not?
I don't know why I'm doing this.
But Kramer, isn't it a question of hygiene?
Why? Is there anything wrong?
I never assisted in a birth before. Its really quite disgusting.
Barry?
Yeah, had some coffee, yeah.
Oh, I found him. He was sitting on the steps of the library. I sat down next to him. He smelled like the locker room after that game against Erasmus
Kramer.
Good for you (sympathetic)
Why should she like me? Who am I? Huh, there's a million people to like.
Oh you told her didn't you.
(worried now) No sir.
(grunting) Hey! Hey, wait a second. I got an idea.
Who said that?
Jerry, a throat-clear is a non-verbal implication of doubt - he thinks I killed Susan!
What?
What if she becomes Miss America? You could be dating Miss America, Jerry!
Hey, I've done that today.
Ahh! How'd she look?
How's this for criticism? Um...you stink. How do like that criticism? You know what's funny to me? That diploma up on the wall. That is my idea of "com-med-dee"! You sitting here, telling people what to do.
I'm going to the bathroom.
Isn't that the uh, Friars Club jacket?
What did they do for toilet paper in the civil war?
Yeah.
I don't know what you're getting all riled up about. There are probably a million Costanzas-
Jerry?
I love the chop sticks. I, I personally prefer a fork but they look very nice.
Why don't you just call 911?
It's too late.
Can't you think of something. Call in a bomb threat.
Hi.
I gave her a twenty, she only gave me change for a ten.
(ready to leave) Well, thank you.
You know, my arm feels a lot better. That Wendy really knows her stuff. (he writes out a cheque)
Elaine, Elaine, Elaine, Elaine...(distant alarm sound which is getting louder.)
Here ... something.
Have you seen the new addition to the Guggenheim?
I don't find her attractive.
Well, live and learn.
I know. I just sort of leaned on it so it would look like it was mine.
That's him over there. The one that looks like a blowfish.
Elaine, can I just explain something to you very privately here? Susan and I have been together many, many times now, and just between you and me, there's really no big surprises here, so...make-up sex is all that I have left.
Do you wanna fight?
(reading the tabs) Jerry, yours is eleven dollars.
Listen. You're beautiful. You're intelligent. You'll meet other girls...
Please give it to me. I love to help people. This is what I do. Come on. I'm going this way. (he takes the table from Jodi's hands and she has no choice but to follow him)
You see, my friend here, his aunt passed away last night.
What's going on?
Hey, hey.
Right.
(pleased) You've made Jerry very happy.
Kramer?!
Let's go, people, let's go! It's Prognosis Negative time, wa ha ha ha!!!
Sons of bitches!
What? I'm comfortable.
Oh, you know, Lloyd, I really don't have it.
I dont get art.
Well, this is the Jerry Seinfeld that only I know. I can't believe I just told you that.
Oh, there's a soup stand, Kramer's been going there.
Ah, see, Mister.. I didn't write that report. That, that's not mine.
Why?
Sounds like a cool guy.
If you're bleak, you're bleak.
Nobody drives like me. Nobody. I'm doing things in this car, you have no idea they're going on. Wanna see me make a right turn from the left lane? Watch this.
You know what I never understood? Why did they change the siren noise? When I was a kid it was always "waaaa, waaaa", you know now it "woo-woo-woo-woo-woo". Why did they do that, did they do some research? Did they find that woo-woo was more effective than waa?
Why did France give that to us anyway?
Wow.
I know what the problem is - I like her too much. That's why I can't make a move.
I tried! I almost threw it down the incinerator, but I couldn't do it. The guilt was too overwhelming. (Grabs the doll, opening the door to leave) Susan's so attached to this thing.
What, you didn't wash all day?
Potussan. Ever try it with club soda?
Oh, great guy.
Oh, the virgin?
You know, Einstein wore the exact same outfit every day.
Hey, you bastards.
Wow, Keith Hernandez. He's such a great player.
Oh, come on.
Well anyway, the, uh... the stone is up, I paid my respects, guess that's it.
Alright, Jerry, I'm gonna get my coat.
That's not Irish.
You weren't thinking.
Well what's in this giant box out in the hall?
Why would I spend seven dollars to see a movie that I could watch on TV?
What might that cost?
Do you swear?
What happened to your itch?
Yeah. Hey Jerry, listen to this. I discovered something even better than conjugal visit sex. Fugitive sex! Now, it's like everytime -
My car's totaled. It's all his fault and now, he has absolutely no money. There is no way that he can pay me. So the judge decrees that he becomes my butler.
Deeply in love. If you can't say anything bad about a relationship, you shouldn't say anything at all.
No I'm not. I *was* bald.
So fast? What about me?
George, don't make me get tough with you. Whu, hu, hu, hu huuuu (raises arms) Who says that? She is really cool. What do you think? You think she likes me?
Really? That's pretty good.
Well what would be the point of that?
(Looks fed up with his parents) Oh my God..
Cause its signals, Jerry, its signals! (snapping his fingers) Dont you- all right. Did she even ask you, what you were doin tomorrow night, if you were busy?
Oh great.
Physical therapy is covered by insurance?
Could you make it two-twenty-five that was his hi-game in bowling.
All right. All right.
I don't understand. They're supposed to be casting this week. Something's wrong. Maybe they're not doing it.
I know I was just telling them the story.
(Putting his jacket on) I'd like to apologize. I want to tell him I.. I.. didn't mean to get him in trouble.
But I digress. Let me see, now. You were standing at one end of the line and I was right next to you. And I remember we were even for like, the first five yards and then , BOOM,...You were gone.
Hid? I have no idea how this suit got misplaced. Nevertheless, I do believe I shall purchase it.
(to himself, resentful) What kind of a snobby, stuck-up, cult is this?!
Oh, yeah, me too, me too. Boy oh boy oh boy...! You know, in fact, I've been thinking about it, and I feel like I'm stealing from you! Five-hundred dollars! It's gonna be worth thousands soon! You know what? On second thought, I can't even accept it.
They could've at least tried!
They're men with jobs, Jerry! They wear suits and ties. They're married, they have secretaries.
That's right. I got his whole car downstairs.
Hey pop, would you buzz off, I've got something cooking.
Youre gonna overdry it.
you know, just by conversing, you can really learn a lot about a person.
Aw, I've just got to say it once, everybody else gets to say it, why can't I say it?
Yeah, I'm gonna let it go.
Dollar Eighty-Nine. Why is this a dollar eighty-nine? Why is there no haggling in this country?
What? Why?
Jerry, can we get out of here?!
Th... this isn't mine.
I have noticed she does tend to go to the bathroom right after we finish eating.
Absolutely, uh, lets see there's, uh, Vandelay Industries, I just saw them. I got very close there. very close.
Tuesday? I can't do it Tuesday. Steinbrenner needs me to run---
when did you get back?
Over here.
Well I was dropping of the calzone money for the week.... Um shouldn't you be at work by now?
I think he should wear whatever tie he wants.
That's gotta hurt!
No no, I never said I was a good driver, I said I was a good parker.
What?
Well I like Dylan.
How come uh, no chair?
Oh my god he's not kidding. (exhale gasp)
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Chunnel . Susan!
Nine. Thirt... thirteen's no good.
No good?
Really, I was, I was only kidding around.
You're luscious. You're ravishing. I would give up red meat just to get a glimpse of you in a bra. Im terribly sorry. (both George and the attractive female applicant stand up as George reaches across the desk and shakes her hand for coming in)
Well, what's so great about a Mom and Pop store? Let me tell you something. If my Mom and Pop ran a store, I wouldn't shop there.
. . . Why not?
(Somewhat angered) She's in traction.
Sir, I'm sure it's not a police matter.
Yeah, as a matter of fact, I did.
Why do they have to do that in front of people?
100 p.m. Do you need any money?
Anything, everything, something, nothing - Who the hell cares? Put me down. I'm down!
(smitten) Audrey? My god, you look incredible! I can't believe it!
I'm really going to do something with these three months.
Well, how did she react?
Yes, I am.
Uh, I just went out, I went to look for my friend?
Uh why don't you wait then go in the movies?
It's nothing, stop it..
You know, anything in the, in the lip area is good.
Shut up!
Dad, what's all this?
Smile
There's a show. That's a show.
Yeah.
We could.
"Sir?"
I-I'm sure if you weren't satisfied you would probably say something wouldn't you?
The one who always sits by herself?
What are you guys doing?
Yeah. Hi. It's great to meet you.
Oh, well, don't worry about it -- he's got plenty of money. (spins his chair away from her)
Yeah, Cubans.
Oh, no no, I cant go back there. Jerry, its so awkward and, you know, it could be dangerous sexually. Something could happen, Id be right back where I started from.
I suppose I could.
Wha... you're going?
Yeah, you're right, you're right. (To Elaine) Alright, maybe he's not interested, but you still know him - can't you just ask him?
Yeah, he's right.
Don't go shouting we got a hundred dollar bill. People will be jumping out of windows on top of us.
And then in the fifth inning, why did you take off on the pop fly?
Well, sure. They're Jewish, and you're a shiksa.
All right. I will see you boys later.
I'm sorry. I can't live knowing Ted Danson makes that much more than me. Who is he?
Yeah I guess. What can I do? I gotta take her with me. Todd introduced us, I'm obligated.
You bought that?
No, that's my only suit. It cost me 350 dollars. I got it at Moe Ginsburg.
Hey - What's going on?
How gee what a coincidence.
Me Too! And he's Dying Jerry! If Relationship George walks through this door, he will Kill Independent George! A George, divided against itself, Cannot Stand!
You've got to start seeing someone else. Get out of this relationship.
Matches? Long matches.
Hey, you like?
Yeah!
Wh-Well maybe you should ask Elaine.
(Annoyed) If that helps you..
It happens.
Ladies. I, uh, I haven't seen this before.
I am aware!
Lot of good ones. I don't even want to mention anyone because I'm afraid I'm going to leave somebody out.
What's your name?
Yeah, I didn't mean that.
Oh, sure. Sure, anything. Can you believe it? There's nothing wrong with me.
What about architect, Steven?
You know, the time..
Well uh....
Where does he come off?
(Entering Jerry's apartment with a cartload of computers) Jerry, I've found a way to beat Lloyd Braun! I buy the computers myself, I store 'em in your apartment. Then, after I win the contest, I bring 'em all back and get my money back. Ha ha! It's brilliant. What? What's wrong with your leg?
Good.
Salsa is now the number one condiment in America.
Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute, don't tell me, don't tell me. It starts with a . . . Duncan Meyers. Oh, wow, this is something. I haven't seen you guys in what, twenty years?
Hey.
And you automatically sleep with her?
Pack of gum. Here you go. (hands the clerk a $100 bill)
So, I am have to going to break up with you.
Hunh, You know, it's the damnedest thing. I went out the window again to, to get a cup of coffee...
Of course.
Well, Dr, Allenwood, uh...I was hoping to compile an - admittedly, rudimentary - scrapbook of her life. Something that Betsy could have, and hold onto.
Who?
June, June, June.
Stop it! It's nothing. It's a stupid holiday my father invented. It doesn't exist!
Why not?
Breath problem?
Fifty-fifty.
And then I hear this rabbi on television, I mean imagine.
What? Every time I leave my house now I have to call everybody I know and ask them if they want to do what I'm doing?
All right, I'm gonna find a guy with a truck. GLC must live on!
What?
Hello.
What did you put the Pez dispenser on her leg for in the first place?
That'd be me.
Yeah. Yeah. With all that kissing and the shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy out in public like that. It's disgusting!
Who's this, Blue Arrow?
(noticing something) Hey look, a dime.
Anyway, I was thinking about what you said. About uh, me and Marisa.
Ah, I guess I should go up and apologize.
What are you, crazy? You were fine.
Hey, it's George.
Oh (snorts) Articulate....Me? I've never articulated anything, i'm completely incoherent.
Exactly.
Well, aren't you the boss of him? You shouldn't let him move up! When I was in the Cub Scouts, I got stuck on Weebolos for three years 'cause I kept losing the Pinewood Derby.
I did. I'm back. I love this relationship, I feel so liberated!
Well, it's not my fault. You poked me!
Beautiful!
Boy that-that bank clock is-is eight minutes off.
Yes, please.
I can't believe they actually found your stolen car.
I've matured.
Yeah. Did you do it?
So you thought she was good looking and figured this would be a good way to meet her.
Hi.
Where are you goin'..
oh,
Theres no way I touch that bag for less than two dollars.
Oh, Hey, eh, there's a spot right in front of the liquor store. You see
Yes.
Great. (They both stand.) Oh, by the way, did you get a chance to read the script?
Yea Yea Yea
It's not working, Jerry. It's just not working. (sits down next to Elaine)
(Gesturing to Jerry) Check the raiser.
Not even close, huh?
(big smile) Eight thousand dollars.
(looking at the door) He's starin' at us.
Do you think she gets to take any of those little bars of soap home?
Das kaffes un salat e grand por favor.
(Picking up the ketchup) What typical? Gimme typical. Gimme some typical.
Yes ... yes, yes
I just got here. My car broke down on the Belt Parkway.
I thought we'd all sign the picture.
Leslie.
I was betrayed! That kid was like a son to me. And if there's one person you should be able to hold down, it's your own flesh and blood. Like my father.. my father's father before him.
"Will you stop with the Jimmies"
Cracks? What were they saying?
No...no...no, I hate to tell you this. Youre not gonna see this woman.
Hi, how are you?
A counter-clockwise swirl.
A knife?
All day. ( phone rings , Jerry picks up)
Rick.
I know I gave it to you.
You don't trust my poker face?
Food?
For what?
I hate asking for change. They always make a face. Like I'm asking them to donate a kidney.
Did you talk to him?
(banging the recorder) Stop it! Stop it!
Yeah! Boy, she is something, isn't she?
What?! Why?
You can't break up with me. I've got hand.
Listen, lemme ask you a question. What if I got a cup of coffee with her?
I'm not! I'm inside the walls!
No, no you really look great.
What does this mean?
(Trying to whisper to Jerry) Look, we are gonna settle this right now! I demand reparations! I should get to sleep with Elaine. That's the only way to punish you!
Yeah?
I tell you what, you give me the twenty, and I will buy *you* a popcorn and soda, and I'll throw in a bon-bons.
Exactly, but theyre on there  waiting. She said she cant wait to see me, were having dinner tonight. Shes supposed to call me as soon as she gets home.
Hey, Tim. Quick question. Is it normal for your teeth to make noises, like a hissing or a chirping?
(worried) Yeah, that's right. What if it's a genetic thing, like father like son?
Guys with cats... I dont know.
All right, I'll tell you what... why don't you go into the store and I'll wait in the car?
Y'know people, we got a situation over here!
Sometimes at restaurants she talks to her food 'Ooh, Mr. Mashed Potatoes, you are sooo goood.'
I'm against all "it's me"s. So self-absorbed and egotistical, it's like those hip musicians with their complicated shoes!
Lighten up.
(to Carrie) You know, the thing is, I kinda promised the widow Mantle that I would name my baby Seven.
Excuse me, are you the guy with that funny laser?
That should be 14, let me just...(corrects it with a pen.)
Well at least you accomplished something. You got fish.
Yes, well, you know, Im not thinking about the price. You know youre the only woman Ive never thought about the price. Get the lobster. I beg you to get the lobster. Go for the lobster.
Holistic.. that sounds right.
Not necessarily.
Nothing.
It's George.
Yes.
So he explained it all to you?
(can't be heard but looks like) Kramer!
25? You don't have anything higher?
That won't be necessary.
So... uh you feel okay about that whole thing... what we do in there... you're generally okay with everything in there?
Sweep?
Really? And Debby told me that she fell in love with him because he has all this perspective!
Thats exquisite. Listen, uh, if its not too much trouble, could you pass me that paper over there?
Oh. Who is this guy?
(Nods) Uh-huh.
Anywhere in the city - I'll tell you the best public toilet.
Personal matter.
You gotta give us odds. At least two to one - you gotta put up two-hundred dollars.
The Human Fund.
It's a funny observation.
Why, you think I should?
(dismissive) It's no good.
It's Juu-uu-une! Hey hay. Yes.
Yeah, Art Vandelay.
Really?
Oh yeeah.. well , Big smoker... I (coughs some more) gave it up for a while but it was too tough. Y' know.....I got no will power.
I got the job?
Yes!
That's dynamite. Yeah, I'll look for the Chinese food leftovers.
Hey.
I don't know.. you and Susan Davis?
(talking on the phone) Jerry you gotta bring me some clothes down here. I lost my job with the Yankees. I'm standing in the men's room on 43rd street in my underpants.
Well, what is it?
(smiling) That is really nice.
Told me what?
Yeah, yeah. He went into the bedroom and started sobbing.
To some degree.
Yeah, the neck hole thing, and I would appreciate it if you would say you're sorry.
It's standard. Has she left you one of those messages where she uses up the whole machine?
Well I can't break up with her now.
No, that's a fair question. It is, uhm... (nervous chuckle) Jerry, yeah. (to Cynthia) Jerry's a friend of mine. (to Russell) He uh, he gave it to me. Unbelievable how many addresses of people this guy has.
Yes, she's pretty. What difference does it make?
What's the difference, you're a woman. They're supposed to be touching you.
Well, then, I am gonna have to ask you to turn your key.
Now let's try "breast"... Celeste... Kest...
It's huge!
You're doing all the leg work.
Oh, this is unbelievable. I'm stuck. Every time I think I'm out, they pull me back in.
Oh my God it is them.
I mean, big would even be ok, a little beyond big.
What's it gonna be? ... You hear that?
So good for you.
(gestures towards book) But I proved it!
She got that from you!
It was a good idea. Susan liked it. Now, if he hadn't vomitted all over her, we'd be writing it right now.
No. This is not cotton. Here, lemme see. (Tries to look at the tag on the uniform. Tartabull gets creeped out and resists.) Will you stop it? (Looks at the tag.) Oh. Of course. Polyester!
About the pizza?
Uh, excuse me, Wyck. Uh, are we, uh, almost done here?
Yes, I mentioned your name.
Absolutely. You're telling me there's no room to move on pasta. All starches are a scam.
What?
(Holding camera) Look at this, I only have one picture left... How 'bout a shot of me and Mr. Morgan?
I'm really serious. I think that's a good idea.
Come on! Come-on.
(to Kramer) You got a job?
What happened to the pact? We were both gonna change. We shook hands on a pact. Did you not shake my hand on it uh?
No-no-no, we all chipped in. We have the money.
Susan, why?
So she coughed.
I need a break, Jerry, you know. I gotta get out of the city. I feel so cramped...
(Staring at the doll) This doll (Pointing) looks like my mother.
I think I got it. How 'bout this? How 'bout this? We trade Jim Leyritz and Bernie Williams, for Barry Bonds, huh? Whadda ya think? That way I have Griffey and Bonds, in the same outfield! Now you got a team! Ha ha ha.
You find this interesting, don't you?
And she loved me. Hoo, ho, she really did.
(high-fiving) Hey!
Absolutely. You just tell him the truth.
Just one? I'm living like twenty. (chuckles) What's yours?
Yeah, sure, we met at Jerry Seinfeld's apartment. When you fumigated for fleas over there.
You don't have your own camera.
So, she's the loser of the group. Every group has someone that they all make fun of.. Like us with Elaine. (Jerry thinks about this, then shakes it off)
Howbout Kramer or Elaine, they don't want them?
Not as good. That's when you realize all the money you're losing.
Toasting makes me uncomfortable. But toast, I love. Never start the day without a good piece of toast. In fact, let's toast to toast.
You know, I could let it go for.. say.. a hundred and twenty-five.
What?
Oh, no no no -- We bought the wine here before, but now, you know we're bl-blocked in by some car double parked and we're just waiting for the guy to pull out.
All right Bubble Boy. Let's just play... Who invaded Spain in the 8th century?
Oh, o.k., yeah. Where am I gonna park here...? (Pulls over.)
Yes, it was purple, I liked it, I dont actually recall considering the buttons.
I don't think we should. We really don't know each other very well.
Forget it? I already called my parents. I told them to expect the surprise of a lifetime. My mothers making her roasted potatoes!
(on tape, singing) "Believe it or not, George, isn't at home, please leave a mes-saaage at the beep. I must be out or I'd pick up the pho-one. Where could I be? Believe it or not, I'm not hooome." (beep)
So, Elaine, are you going to sleep with me or what?!
Fragile Frankie Merman? I never liked that guy.
(Scoffs) Writer. We're talking about a sit-com.
Well, what happened when you got upstairs?
Yeah. It doesn't make any difference.
Hey.
I gave. I gave everything I could Mrs. Sokol. but nothing was good enough for her.
Yeah?...
I'll tell ya, if I had one of these things, I'd be eatin' hot dogs all the time.
Oh yeah HA-A-A, HA-A-A.
Well I think it would be nice if there was some kind of historical record of it.
...What?
What about the regards?
Alright. (Holds them up)
(To Jerry) We got work to do. What about the meeting?
How could he not have washed?
And?
Yeah, coy.
All right, I?ll tell you what, you seem like a nice guy, let?s stop jerking around. Give me.. two hundred and fifty dollars, I?ve got people waiting for me, I've got to get the hell out of here.
No! Absolutely Not!
Hi.
What the hell is going on here?
They were right outside!
Maura. (starts acting dramatically, looking from Maura to Loretta and back again) Oh, my God! What are you doing here?!
She didn't mention anything about the conversation?
Why couldn't you squeeze one of those stupid rubber balls to get your stress out? Why did you have to destroy *twenty-five* computers?
Listen I was talking to Elaine today and she said she'd would really like to be an usher at the wedding
It's over, Jerry. She's gettin' out.
Yes, good for me!
Which market, the, eh, big one, the big market, the big board. Bull market, bear market, you name the market, I'm there.
How 'bout Kramer.
It's all departures. I see nothing but departures. (to the woman beside him) Do you know where the arrivals are?
Anyway, I think everything else is okay. Unless of course she's faking.
"Right!"
(claps hands triumphantly) We might have an 'it'!
Well, not recently. I craved. I crave all the time, constant craving...but I haven't yearned.
You should have somebody take a look at that.
Yeah?
Because the underwear is pulled up from the back and ... it wedges in..
Are you crazy?! What are you doing?! You'll get us killed!
Hi, I need some party invitations.
No, you just tell him ah, an old boyfriend has come back into your life.
Yeah.
That's pretty long.
Hey.
Wait a minute, wait, it's not that stupid.
No. Thanks, dad.
No...
I know.
(standing) All right, I'm gonna move my car, my meter's up. Can't park in this city.
I'm the bad boy. I've never been the bad boy.
Did you here that? I can't believe this he's eating his sandwich.
You know what I was just thinking -- she could really use a raise.
(singing) Meet the Mets...
You think?
I could be a character.
Imagine if I had to see them both on the same day? (mirthless) Haha! It's like runnin' a double marathon!
No, no the full size.
(whistling).(laughing).AlrightOK.
What?!
Jerry. Jerry.
Sh, sh, goodbye, sh, get away.
He he This guy really gets around.
Mine too.
(smile) Yeah.
(pleased with himself) You are having problems with your boyfriend and I am meeting you to discuss the situation.
The closet business? What's the closet business?
An eye job? Ma, you don't need an eye job.
Okay, Okay. Who do you think you're talking to? What are ya' you trying to make a joke, because it's not funny. I can tell you that.
It's not the same.
It means a non-Jewish woman.
It's a cleaning.
Really? (Jerry shakes his head) Maybe this will become like a cool thing, living with your parents.
Oh my!
Well I've never met your sister but obviously these are not hard-and-fast rules. (to the waitress) Darling, the tea is getting a little cold sweetheart.
Let me ask you something. What do you think of this shirt?
Get out!! (Jerry gets out and George drives away. A couple of guys notice Jerry in his cowboy boots.)
You think so?
Jerry, for all I know this guy went out of his way to not invite you. How am I gonna feel if I show up with an uninvited, unwelcome intruder?
Its your decision.
She invited me up. Coffees not coffee, coffee is sex.
'The lights are much brighter there. You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares, just go...'
No, no, no... Just a *tiny* bit... It's not even *frontal* nudity. It's... *sidal* nudity...
(shouts) Wait! Yes! That's what I should've said! (frustration) D'ohh!
That doesn't explain the lipstick on the dashboard?
I snapped! It was the last straw. (sighs)
Yeah?
I just remembered, I gotta be someplace. Yuh-hu-hur, that's enough. Pop. Pop, put down the wrench, Pop.
Do I smell?
Ha! Heh.
These are the balloons? Big deal, all I see is Woody Woodpecker.
Were really glad for you.
So you're moving there for spite!
See ya.
Well actually I'm...
(To the man behind him in line) Yeah, right Im gonna get my car repaired at a dealership. Huh! Why dont I just flush my money down the toilet?
I think this is him right here.
Newman!!
I don't want to talk about it.
Hi, Elaine.
I just popped in now. I'm a big pop-in guy.
(considers for a second) I dont care.
You don't think I can?
(Muttering) Susan has the doll collection.. one of the dolls looks exactly like my mother.. she likes to sleep with it.
Good to see you again.
This could have been a huge mistake.
Oh, please ... ... four dollars is f...
Who is Sir Arthur Conan Doyle?
I'm uh... writing a pilot for NBC...
She doesn't deserve a baby shower. She deserves a baby monsoon. She deserves Rosemary's baby!
Hi.
I never tasted a cough medicine I didn't love.
Which one?
Who's got the receipt?
And in bed--
How are we gonna get out of here? They'll kill us!
(handing over a bill) Can I get a pack of gum, please?
If my parents had a mantel, I might be a completely different person.
Oh, that's too bad. I kinda wanted to meet him, seeing as how we look so similar.
So what did she say?
Right.
Playground equipment.
Hey, starving! (Grabs the box from Jerry)
Hope he's not the guy.
I have to get in touch with Tatiana! And look at his little outfit. It's all so coordinated, the way his socks matching to his shirt. I really hate this guy.
What does that mean?
You think so?
Well I can't now, Gwen's going to be there.
Hi.
Uhh.. I'll- I'll meet you down there.
I'm sorry the card says MOOPS.
I'm bad. I'm *bad*!
What is that?
Oh, what time is it? Eight thirty? I'll tell you what's on. You got Major Dad, Blossom, very funny programme...
And the underwater bubble cities?
Well, I still don't know what I'm supposed to do. I don't even know what my assignment is.
It's about the show. It... No, it was...
Oh no no no no, don't say anything to Kramer. Susan can't stand him. He vomited all over her.
What are we gonna do? How are we gonna get out of here?
(With pride) Made it up.
Alright, alright, but no funny business, same deal as last night.
Well it's a little strange. You going to start to talk like Elaine from now on?
Specific, Ah, lets see. I've walked in and out of so many buildings they all .. blend in together, I uh, ..
(incredulity) Him you brainwashed! (angry shout) What's he got that I don't have?!
We had sex.
I'm wearin' a little hat, I'm jumpin' through fire.. They're puttin' their little alien heads in my mouth..
I know. I know. That's what I do. That's what I do.
I'm not really sure, I...
So, she cant get the apartment.
(shouting) What happened to Soda?! I thought we all agreed on Soda.
"Breakfast At Tiffany's." 90 pages. (Waves a hand like it's nothing.)
Nothing really, you know...just eh, stroll around the cell blocks, maybe eh, take in a shower fight. (chuckles.) Hey eh, you know you got a bounced check hanging up in the little market over on Columbus?
And now?
(Eating a sandwich) Oh, like you really know busboys.
An ostrich burger.
Make-up sex? You have to have that right after the fight, we're way past that.
(a little worried) He uh, he doesn't have the auto shop any more?
Alright. 7,7, (points at himself) 6. I'm not gonna eat that much!
FINE? WHAT SIZE?
Water. Need some water! Water here!
(To his girlfriend) Nina, you have to decide right now. Jerry or me?
Wha?
Because they were heated up there.
You see. You see! Listen when is your next drawing class?
Wow, he really does a number on you. (reads) "Seinfeld froze like a deer in the headlights in the face of incessant heckling."
Elaine's coming up?
No, no. I'm just thinking.
(Puts his arms in the air, stretching, and covers his mouth with an arm) Could you ask her, just ask her. If she says no, case closed.
Yeah, come on.
Every five years!
Oh, yes. Hello.
Well, here we are.
With the two of us?
I've done that. Did you ever eat an ostrich burger?
Radiating waves of pain..
Hey, Mr Lazzari.
How's the trip?
Sure. (Turns around.)
Yup.
Why? Why is my code so important?
She thinks I'm a nice guy. Women always think I'm nice, but women don'tnice.
Neeson? How are you comparing Liam Neeson with Jon Voight? Jerry, we're talking about Joe Buck. If you can play Joe Buck, Oskar Schindler's a cake walk. (Opens the car door for Jerry, Jerry's about to get in.)
All right. (tearing his jacket off) Let me just say one thing there is no way that this is gonna happen. You hear me? No Way! Because if you think I'm going' to two Thanksgivings, you're out of your mind!!!
(getting irritated) He's an importer-exporter. Okay?
Well, I'm here. What is it?
Well, I didn't really tell Susan about it, and she doesn't really have anything else to do.
So?
Yeah, yeah, and we started talking, and she's this lawyer who's incredible! Everything I said was funny! You know, she laughed at everything I said, she thinks I'm hilarious. You know in a way, it was almost too good. I started so good, I can't go any place but down now, ya know? I got no place to go.
Robin? Robin!
(afraid not) No no, no no no. You're not goin' in there.
Fine, I'll buy a pack of gum.
What are they gonna do?
Curly.
Listen, maybe we shouldn't start writing today. I got a lot on my mind.
Come on, wanna give me a hand with the computers?
(Mr.Wilhelm comes in and hears George yelling) You tell that son of a bitch no Yankee is ever comin' to Houston! Not as long as you bastards are running things!
Alright. I guess I just have to pick myself up, dust myself off, and throw myself right back down again!
(to Elaine) Right, alright. (to Jerry) Oh Jerry, do you have any apples?
No..
No! No. It's not good, I don't think so.
Look at me! I am man! I am you!
She doesn't like. Here is your blue one, it's her favorite. (Takes sweater out of his bag.)
She called my office. She said shes been in the Hamptons since Sunday. She didnt know if I was trying to get in touch with her. Her machine broke, and shes been using her old machine and she doesnt have the beeper for it.
Let me put that on speaker phone.
(holding his cane) I gotta hobble. (walks out)
Go, go, get out, ...
(Holding out his arms - giving praise) It's beautiful. Now, what do I say?
What?
Yeah, tell im. But quickly, Im double parked here.
Oh.
Oh, uh, just a friend of mine.
You going to the party?
An idea for the show.
All these years I've been chuckin' and you've never told me?
I'm the one he wants! He's coming to settle the score.
I can't.
(reluctant) Oh that uh, that seems like a lotta trouble.
Have you ever seen a Schnitzer's rye? It - it's huge!
Perhaps.
Not me. Everything should be negotiable. (he picks up a container of fruit)
You know, I can't talk to you anymore.
They did?
Would a giant rubber ball work?
Well, thats flattering.
I gotta try and find a way to switch places with him. It's like a Sigfried and Roy trick.
Hey, when you order from the waitress, get her to point to the menu. I want to see what finger she uses.
Youre gonna be neighbors.
...Who's not doing this for the money.
Five-thousand? Why would anybody buy Kramer for $5000? (laughs)
Oh I hate to hear this. That kind of growth really irritates me.
(Trying to keep it down) Because I like this one! (Notices people staring at him, he quickly gets up, collecting the his coat and the tiny replica) C'mon, let's go. Let's go! (On his way out, he stops in front of a woman blocking his path) Oh, hi.. (Embarrassed about the doll, he sheepishly walks out)
(meekly) Well, it's true. I saw it.
Yeah. See ya.
No. I didn't get it.
She's leaving me dirty messages on my answering machine.
You know that coat was Gore-Tex. Its worth a hell of a lot more than that, cheap Chardonnay.
No, you said you didn't like it...
Not now Florice.
Very good.
I could take it in merchandise..
What do I do? Well actually, I'm a writer. In fact, I'm writing a comedy pilot for NBC right now.
I loved her!
Oh Shut up! What are you doing back so soon, anyway? (puts the tape back in it's case.)
Elaine, when a woman makes a Ball Entrance.. she twirls.
How ya doin'?
No, no...
Elaine you don't understand. I had 103 temperature when I bought that sweater. I was so dizzy I was seeing red dots everywhere. I thought everything in the store had a red dot on it. I couldn't distinguish one red dot from another. I couldn't afford anything. I have nothing. I haven't worked for a really long time. (Jerry is standing right behind George. Jerry takes out a hankerchief and starts fake-crying in it.) I mean look, I have no clothes, look at what I'm wearing. It's just a little red dot.
MOOPS,
Jerry gargles? Is that why he takes so long?
All right, all right. KNOCK IT OFF. Come on, let's go.
Of course. But I really wanna leave my mark this time, you know, uh. I wanna walk away from the Yankees with people saying 'Wow! Now that guy got canned!'
I'll bet you, how much?
Lunch is fine at the beginning then you move on to dinner. you don't move back to lunch. It's like being demoted. I'll never do another crossword puzzle with her again. I know it.
N.I. Not interested.
So let me ask you a question about the tip jar. I had a little thing with the calzone guy this week. I go to drop a buck in the tip jar and just as I am about to drop it in he looks the other way. And then when I am leaving he gives me this look think thanks for nothing. I mean if they don't notice it what's the point.
Nope. I wept like a baby.
Shh! This is it!
Defective?!
Well, some of 'em look good. The ones that look good you don't even know about.
Let's see if it's Hayman?
Nice meeting you.
Huh? You know? Spring. Rejuvenation. Rebirth. Everything's blooming. All that crap.
(angry that she believes Al was right) No he's not right. Al Netchie is not right! Alright I'm canceling the father-son picnic. I don't know what he's gonna do with all that potato salad.
(shouting) No No No!
Jerry, this whole Ellen situation.. has gone far enough.
She kept such a nice clean apartment. She was so sanitary.
Guess what.
You know, I can't remember the last time I called a woman without being nervous. I, usually, I'm pacing all over the room, I'm...
Wow.
You know what I would like to do? I would really like to have sex with a tall woman. I mean really tall. Like a like a giant Like six five.
Wait a minute. This looks familiar. This reminds me of something. I can do this.
try shaking it...(long pause) Well,Janet should be here any minute.
She seems like an it.
(still by the door) What? M-Maura, what are you doin' here? I ended this relationship... twice!
Soda. S-O-D-A. Soda.
Joe...
How so? I'll tell you how so. She's bald!
Yeah, I slept at my parents' house.
Oh, you haven't heard, she's going to live with her grandparents in Redding Pennsylvania.
Well, it was very nice meeting you Shelly and Jerry be careful, there's a lot of nuts out there. (to Paula) All right you have everything?
Nah, the cable's out. What's with you? You look dead.
So, much longer?
I bawled uncontrollably. I just poured my guts out. And I'll tell you, Jerry, it was incredible. I never realized how powerful these tears are. I could have postponed it another five years if I wanted to.
Well hello. Um, ah, specifically the reason that I'm here, uh, I don't know uh what Elaine told you but uh I broke up with my girlfriend a couple of weeks ago. Actually she broke up with me [struggling with his coat zipper] and uh, well, I was the cause of it and uh, I just wanted to find out from you ... What's with this thing?
No, no, no, no. Borrowing money from a friend is like having sex. It just completely changes the relationship.
(Talking about his would-be apartment) You could fit 15 people in that bathroom..
You know, I could have actually gone to that.
Hey, hey, how was Florida?
Flowing?
Listen to the comeback. (pleased) 'Oh yeah? Well the jerk store called. They're running outta you.'
I'm grotesque . I look like a troll.
I had a feeling you would like it. No, don't try it on now, try it on later.
I did it! It's all done!
Yeah well, they won't know. I got the car there.
Oh, Hey, hey, hey! That's great! That's very nice. You know we've been waiting twenty minutes for you people?! What do you think, you're Mussolini?!
You mean a walk back in? That's the toughest move in the business. You're sending me out into no-mans-land, and if I get shot down I have to crawl all the way back. Well I can't do it! I can't do it, I tell ya!
Oh, no, thanks. I cant drink coffee late at night, it keeps me up.
Yeah.
Because we brought it for them!
I thought it was a date.
Because it's really a pretty good little story. Don't you think?
What are you talking about.. I WANT MY CAR!!
I just thought of a great name for myself, if I ever become a porno actor.
Yeah, You remember the, the little eh, bank book, there?
(jokingly) You are still paying for this lunch?
Wendy? Is that the uh, physical therapist?
(moody) Great! Now she's sour!
My cars a little crumpled?!?
"How's it going?" - beautiful.
(pointing out the positive) But happy.
I wonder if, ah, Susan ... (picks up the phone from the coffee table, then decides not to call) No. I better just go. (claps hands) heh. All right! See ya. (grabs his rain coat from the hook by the door and rushes out)
OK, OK, I never even had him for gym.
Who's he?
I can't, Steinbrenner might still be there!
(Laughs) Relationship intern...hey, what if two of us teamed up?
Well... we could dance around it a little first.
(Shrugging it off) She'll be fine. I gotta go to the hospital to see her tonight.
I need higher. This has paba in it, I need paba-free.
Well, I think you're wrong about that. [Elaine walks past the window again, glancing in] And ah now if you'll excuse me, I'd really like to get started, please.
No! My ticket?! You gave my ticket to Horneck?
we rode along all the way to the hospital
He might as well have! I caught him, and his face was covered in chocolate and cookie crumbs.
Should be a while though.
I'll be O'Brien.
I've looked at that, seems unlikely.
Yeah.
(Obviously lying) No.
Well, I'm just expressing my gratitude to our gracious host.
(pointedly to Elaine) Oh. Thanks very much for yesterday, by the way.
No. Nothing. Fine. (he sits at the table)
Out of the question. Out of the question!
"Arrrrrrgh!! .. It's George.. Oh! Sports wholesaler. yeah. yeah. .. thanks for calling back. No , no , no still got the shoes, still got the shoes. Lots of them. This is.. beautiful athletic gear."
Nevertheless. His time has come.
Ohhhhh.. John-John.
Ya-hah.
You're going like that?
Does she care? No. Does anyone ever display the slightest sensitivity over the problems of a fellow individual? No. No. A resounding no!
Will they give us cash?
You're Killing Independent George! You know that, don't you?
Forget Gammy.
(indicates with his head) The cashier.
(Outraged. Leaving) Well, you just lost a lot of business! Because I love to read!
Hey, frolf?
Is "yada yada" bad?
Rid? Nah, c'mon, the word is 'care'. Care. I care about your comfort, be it here in Queens or twelve-hundred miles away.
Wa?
Look at all of those! You're rich!
(Scoffs) No, I told you, I'm not gonna do that.
How'd the Mets do?
(crouches too) What? Where? Where?
Now she thinks we're gay, not that there's anything wrong with it...
No, you wont.
Okay. How about this?
You know the anxiety you feel on a date? That's what I have every day now. My worst nightmare's come true, every day is a date.
Yeah, the tenant association has decided to hear my side of the story. So, uh, I gotta kinda get ready. I'll see ya.
We'll have 2 slices and 2 grape sodas.
Okay! Alright!
Good....good day (not too convincing) You?
Oh, I got it.
You have to drink that whole thing?
The New York Yankees!
Oh ya, like there's something wrong with saying 'God bless you'. I was raised to say 'God bless you'.
No, no, no, no.
(tasting the wine) Excellent. Like I really know what I'm talking about.
I'll tell you something, I've never seen a pilot script as funny as this!
Me run in? Why don't you run in?
Oh, what's the point? When I like them, they don't like me, when they like me, I don't like them. Why can't I act with the ones I like the same way I do with the ones I don't like?
It's that bleak? (pours a glass of milk)
Well, well, well.
It's not that long, really.
So you think she likes me?
No, no, Kurt - wrong attitude. You should be happy now.
Oh, right! (Shakes her hand) Right! Hey, hey.. I love the floors in here. It's like a gymnasium in here! Try and guard me! (Dribbles an imaginary ball
...pianist. A *classical* pianist. She *plays* the piano. She's a *brilliant* woman. I-I-I sat in her living room... She played the *Waldstein Sonata*! The *Waldstein*!
Hey I get a free trip to Paris, I go in the Big Brother's Hall-of-Fame, I mail my own postcards.
Well, I, I got the pilot of the Jerry show.
I'd get tired of it.
Don't worry. We won't forget!
I think we have.
Twelve dollars? I knew we should have gone to the bakery. I guarantee you theyre not getting no twelve dollar cake.
Exactly..
(NOT INTERESTED) Really.
(whispering) Elaine, it's me, George.
All right, if she puts the bags down before she greets you, thats a good sign.
It's complicated.
What do you mean, like him?
(Rubbing his stomach) Ooh.. Something's not sitting right..
Elaine, huh... Peterman account?
(relishing) Hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm. Delicious.
(Snapping) Is that important, really? What is this, a police investigation? The woman's been through enough. She has to relive the experience now?!
Now?! I'm a mutant!
Ah, beat it, punk.
I'd like to hear that.
Kramer was on Murphy Brown?
(sarcastically) Thats funny. Youre a funny guy.
What's the massage situation?
That's the genius of it.
Yeah, she's a B.L.
So, you send me to this therapist to help me with my emotional disorders, and she criticizes our script. (Tosses the script to Jerry.) What kind of a therapist is that?
(grateful, relieved) Thank you! I'm gonna make you both so happy!
I feel terrible, I can't be responsible for breaking up a marriage. Oh no (starting moving for the door, Elaine begins to stop him)
And it's their anniversary Friday night. I could send them for a hansom cab ride. Y -- you think they'd like that?
Why?
What is Tungsten or Wolfram?
(to Kramer) What about your stuff?
No but say hello for me.
I know, they're out of their minds! It's fantastic!
(Defensively) Whatever.
I had a fight with Susan.
Elaine, I once told a woman that I coined the phrase, "Pardon my French."
Come on. Come on. Come on. Yeah. Yeah. (grunting)
No. That's just electric.
Yes they did. I was covering. Elaine has been deported back to Scotland.
Mr. Tuttle, you're back.
Sounds like a rough trip.
You really think this looks O.K. on me?
Yes, well, if the other people in the office saw that I called an exterminator, they would just panic. Besides, this is sort of a friendly visit. Carl, right?
Why didn't anything happen between you two?
Well, Im going with him. Id like to... Ive never done a solid before.
Well, is he good, Kramer?
Ask' em Are there any side effects?
What are we supposed to do? What do you do on a situation like this? Should we call a lawyer, should we call the police?
I'm gonna go meet Danielle. (grabs his coat) There's a new Neil in town! (triumphant laughter) Hahaha!
Don't you see what it says here? Don't you understand what that's implying?
Aw, hoh, oh Deena, thank God. (he hugs Deena) Thank God you're here. Listen, you gotta help me. You gotta tell these people that I'm okay. You know that I don't belong in here.
Of course he should consider it, but now is not the time!
I dont want to get out of it.
Right above you?
I spilled some Chardonnay. So, what did you get?
(Concerned) Why're you doing this, Jerry? Is it your career? Things will pick up.
I see.
(whistling)
Because, I've got the coat. I can sit in the car and not get cold.
I'm writin' it. "How's it going?"
Oh, God...
How did you get all this?
She's not out there!
(stops Jerry realizing something) Hey hey hey hey hey hey.
Oh yeah, right. When's he coming back?
Okay.
[quite out loud, not even pretending to whisper] Elaine!
No, tell me.
It's fine, we'll just meet him at the bubble boy's house.
I dont know, 120, 130Then they sent some guys to sandblast for 6 hours. Tomorrow they are putting in asbestos.
I like, uh...(mutters something unintelligible under his breath.)
Kramer, please.
Ive spent the last hour preparing ten candy bars with no wrappers or identification of any kind for him to select from.
I just want the both of you to know how much you mean to me, and I love you both very, very much.
Yes it is.
You would think that, but either youre born with a sense of humor, or youre not. Its not going to change even if you go from the red sun of Krypton all the way to the yellow sun of the Earth.
Hey, hey, hey! You don't call me back?!
Still lookin'. It's pretty bad out there. What about you?
(To Estelle) Scissor. (She gets the scissors from the coffee table and hands them to George with the point facing him) Don't hand them to me with the point facing out!
You think she liked me? She seemed to like me.
No, no thanks.
(con't) A-Anyway, I was thinking we would take two cars up to the cabin and that way if one of wanted to stay you know...
What's the difference? Let's go to Reggies.
Well, that pear shaped loser was me! And I was in that photo, until I broke in here, stole the photograph and airbrushed myself out of there!
(acting disappointed) Oh, please don't.
Absolutely. Because instead of doing a wash, I just keep buying underwear. My goal is to have over three hundred and sixty pair. That way, I only have to do wash once a year.
Holly.
Thats my candy line-up! Where are all my cards?! Theyre - theyre all on the floor!
Happy Festivus! (Sees Elaine) Yama - Hama!
We got a soccer game in Chile. Anyway, the plane crashes. Who are you gonna eat to survive?
(Mocking, skeptic) Yeah, you show us the 900.
Aren't those the guys that always go crazy and come back with a gun and shoot everybody?
Embracing my roots.
Why is that?
I said so many things.
You can't compromise your principles!
Hey Elaine, does Tony like peanut butter?
Yeah.
You do know Kramer?
What's that?
When you're talking about a movie like "Beaches", moving from the chair to the couch , . . . that's quite a voyage.
(rising to his feet) Hey! Hey, you! (setting off after her) Come back here!! Don't gallop away!!
Huh. What, the whole apartment?
(cheerful) Alright, there you go. She's gonna get the jacket back. (claps hands) So, let's go get some coffee, huh?
It's not a pet! It's a wild invalid! And it knows that I tried to kill it. As soon as it gets better, it's gonna gnaw my brain out in my sleep!
(proffering glasses) I hope prune juice is alright. It's the only thing I had that was chilled.
Kinda busy here.
Jerry, it's me, George, don't worry, I'll return it tomorrow, no problem.
Take a wild guess.
I thought I saw something fly over here...
Whadday'mean.?
(Pleading for them to stop) Mom.. dad.
It was.
Yeah.
We should take his limo.
Yes, I think I would.
I zipped up!
Oh, ok. Thank you. It was good talking to you.
So in order to use these, I gotta spend like fifteen-hundred bucks. This is a bill for fifteen-hundred dollars. Plus, she'd ask about the sleeping arrangements, that whole sleeping arrangement conversation is depressing.
Allison bought it for me.
Why can't I stay?
I'm very attracted to you..
Thats all there is to it. By Christmas day I will be Brother Costanza.
She stayed over?
(Laughs as they leave) It's working already! (Both exit)
Well, it's definetly him.
Maybe I can get her locked up.
I don't want to walk that far.
She cant even afford to go out to lunch. She's been eating in a high school cafeterias She pretends to be a teacher. It's pathetic.
You do it for me.
(Getting in a more panicked state) Oh God, Mommy!
I don't know, she said she had to pick up a friend of hers at the airport. It cost me a hundred dollars this ticket.
I keep wracking my brain to try and figure out what I did. I was smart, I was funny, I made great small talk with the waitress so she could see I could relate to the commoners, you know, I'm a man of the people.
"Ah! your just mad 'cause we beat ya."
You see? We were made for each other. (Thinking to himself) It's amazing. If I reach out and touch her breast right not, she'd scream and throw me out of the car. But at this time tomorrow, I could touch it all I want.
Yeah, (cough) Definite smoke.
Wait, wait a second, what are you doing?
No, not Lloyd Braun. But the cashier.
I'm leaving.
(Defensively loud) It was when I was banging!
Alright, here we go. You got it?
There's nothing to talk about.
Ross'.
Yada yada yada...
(to the waitress bringing his doughnut) And a slice of devil's food cake.
Were aware of the proximity to the park, yes.
Really!
I was so shocked I was lucky I said anything.
Well who schedules his wedding on Super Bowl Sunday?
Then I asked her if she wanted a drink.
No, that's not it at all.
Oh, my God.
(Extremely blunt) Burned.
Ten minutes! Here, here, (Fishes a box of Tic-Tacs out of his coat pocket and tosses them to her) Have some Tic-Tacs.
Tell me your impressions, I would love to hear what a young woman thinks of "The Big Game".
The third?
There was something so reassuring about that cozy little space.
No, you're not taking a deli slicer to my boss...
(Again, sarcastic) Oh, what a huge blow to the culture.
(Annoyed) Frog is wrong.
[embarrassed pause] ``Rochelle, Rochelle''.
All my friends do that.
(to the cashier) Excuse me, I gave you a twenty dollar bill and you only actually gave me change for a ten.
(glances upwards) Yeah. Uhm, why did she die so young?
Wha - what are you doing later?
I've never seen a big salad.
I can tell you this. If I am not in front of my house at six-fifteen, when my parents get there, they will put me on an aggravation installment plan that will compound with interest for decades.
Big hefty stinking faux pas.
I really don't think we're supposed to be talkin' about this.
That's got nothing to do with it.
I knew this was gonna happen some day. It was inevitable. I've known it ever since I was a little kid. I've been waiting for it.
Hey.
It would have been nice if someone told me about it. I just think you could have said something. That's all.
Oh, thank you.
I look like me and I'm working from the outside. Who do you think is in the better position?
You can't handle the truth! (he salutes) (imitating Jack Nicholson [a.k.a. Col. Nathan R. Jessep], from the 1992 movie A Few Good Men)
Ya manufacture it.
We're out of Bosco!
You know Elaine, I'd do it but I'm working that day.
Really? What happened?
What? Really?
I'm better than him.
You know, all these years, I've always wanted to see the two of you get back together.
(excited) You're saying I stand to inherit three hundred thousand dollars, is that what you're saying?!
I know. I know.
Well what do you eat?
uh uh, we're uh ..
Pretty chintzy, huh? Considering the money she makes.. She's a big executive for Federal Express.
No, she left. Listen, you can't mention any of this to Elaine. Cynthia will kill me, we made a deal.
All right, forget that idea, it's not for you....Okay, okay, I got it. You run an antique store.
Well if she can't tell "six" from "sex" then how is she going to lip read from across the room?
Yeah. Yeah, he's quite a character.
Thank you Mr.Farkus, thank you very much indeed sir.
Is that so? Or could it be that you're just a *little* bit worried that you may have missed the boat?
Really?
You're sorry?!
And you know what else I've decided to do? I'm going to keep seeing the bald woman.
(seeing Jerry's van shaking) What is that? That van's a-rockin'.
I don't think I could do it. You know, they always remember the first time. I don't want to be remembered. I wanna be forgotten.
(dryly) You're on that list.
(surprised) You know her name?
Ill tell you, if I was running for office I would ask for the death penalty for double-parkers. If this is allowed to go on this is not a society. THIS IS ANARCHY!
I dunno. I guess I have to wait for her to die.
(Uncapping his pen) Alright, here we go.
That's right.
I'm gonna get a Chow Fung.
What about the mail?
Hey.
if you hadn't come, this whole thing wouldn't have happen (back on Jerry and Elaine's side, we can hear George saying "I was the one who was invited", Jerry opens the door)
I want you to have this job. Of course...
That's what I'm afraid of. You know Mr. Steinbrenner, . . .
Hey Kramer, c'mon-- it was 240 bucks twenty years ago...
That's right! He never apologized to me for saying that I would stretch out the neck hole of his sweater.
Um, I don't uh, really think I can go.
Sure. Thank you for coming in. (Tom eats some raisins)
Oh-ohf (snorts) yeah, I'm a writer. (laughs)
(entering Monk's) Hey.
Beef-A-Reeno? You fed the horse Beef-A-Reeno?!
'Stanky Hanke'? What did he want?
Yeah, well when you don't actually do the steps, you can go through them pretty quick. You can get through six a day.
Hello?
Look, I have my system. First I look for the dream spot right in front of the door, then I slowly expand out in concentric circles.
(clears throat) Heather Hi, it's George Costanza.
(running out and away from the van) I knew it wasn't Berkowitz!
Oh they'll get out of the way. You really smell banana?
Shocked?
Theyre the ones who should be ashamed. They signed me to a one-year contract. As long as I show up for work every day, they have to pay me.
Yeah, yeah. That's how they talk in the major league. (laughs)
All right, I gotta get going. My parents are expecting me.
Let's say it comes down to me and one other guy. He's got a nice quiet suit, and I'm whooshing all over the place! Who do you think he's gonna hire?
But it--eh.. It was here, I'm tellin' you, an' w--w--it was really here! The, there was, a, bar, and a, an' a dance floor..
Double jump! Eat the fly! Eat it!
(on intercom) It's George.
Who was he?
We should have left earlier. I told you.
No, you haven't. Well, maybe you have. What do I know.
Wait a minute, Rinitze? Don't they have somme really cool suits in there?
Hello, Ken. It's George Costanza. I think we need to talk.
(Reading) I see here that you play the harp.. tell me, why do you have to tilt it? Can't you just build it on an angle? It'd save you a lot of trouble.
It's cleavage. I couldn't look away. What am I, waiting to win an Oscar here? This is all I have in my life.
Yeah. Yeah, one second.
yeah that's right. I like it. He's such a cool guy
(Sarcastic) Yeah, yeah. I'm gonna move in with him. He doesn't even let you use the toilet!
Well, Play Now has all kinds of different rubber balls. Why dont we test your bladder system at my office?
Good, good day. How was your day?
"Hey"
I need some water. I gotta get some water.
I didn't know you were such a Bette Midler fan.
Yes, oh yes very much.
Yep, and the photo was all fixed and back on his desk, no thanks to you.
(regarding the menu) What're you getting?
Care to make it interesting?
Sorry, the card says Moops.
Did you just say vault?
(Jerry is going to his bedroom) What?
I never should have brought her up there. Should have known better. Should have seen it coming. I didn't see it coming.
Hey, yeah. My parents want to come too, is that ok?
And Elaine is gonna keep him busy.
Right.
I'm bootleggin' a movie, baby!
Yeah, like he was really gonna take your money.
The wedding is off. Now you can go to the Super Bowl.
Hey. There is a couple of people that wouldn't mind having me out of the way.
he..he's alive
Hey, Van B. Boys.
Hes a cube. Anyway, he got married six months ago. He told me ever since hes been wearing a wedding band, women have been coming on to him everywhere he goes.
Well Elaine was supposed to help me.
Hey. Hey. Answer me! Come on, show yourselves!
So I tell Alec that I have to go to Paris for an undetermined amount of time. Then all I have to do is buy some post cards and have your parents mail them from Paris.
Oh sure, sure. You wanna be alone, sure. I understand that, you wanna a little time to think uh thing..ponder things..you know..ruminant..(chuckles) you go ahead, lotta stuff on your mind..you think things out..Think, mull, mull, do a lot of mulling. (short laugh then exits Monk's)
Oh no! Im vigilant. Theyll never get me out. Im like a weed, Jerry.
So they're flying the tiny instruments in from El Paso.
So you think you can put the suit aside and hold it for me?
I'm an architect.
Really?
Yes Mr. Hayman.
Really?
Who's Killer Kowalski?
(seeing Elaine and Puddy come into Monk's) Yeah. Hey, Lainie, Puddy.
Where's the crazy man, Come on up.
Oh, me, me, me, me, me!
He didnt do anything, Jerry. Its a scam! Who told you to do that?
No, I got my own place.
What trip? You were gone?
That's a tough minute. It's like waiting in the shower for the conditioner to work.
(entering Monk's) Oh, hello, Hanke, others.
With all due respect, I don't think so...
I have a point, I have a point.
You've got 'shiksappeal'. Jewish men love the idea of meeting a woman that's not like their mother.
A pack of teenagers?
Trapezoid?
Funny, cause I happen to be very good friends with Keith Hernandez.
Nobody's hiring now. The market's terrible.
I wouldn't mind seein' <that>.
Jerry! Stop it!
yeah, Kramer, we're, uh, kind of in the middle of something here. We're trying to do a little work..
Better get that checked out?
Well, I've to every Brentano's. This thing's flagged in every database in town!
You're throwing the set?
(Getting up) You know what? Maybe I should take off.
Bye, Dolores.
I, I dont know.
(animated) Are you insane? Jerk store, woulda smoked that guy! Smoked him, I say.
Bologna?! No one eats bologna anymore!
What's all this?
I told you.
Care? Forget about care. Love. They have to love the characters. Otherwise, why would they keep tuning in?
We cant just let him get away with this.
Hi Allison, thats a nice dress.
Well, you really did it to me this time, Seinfeld. . . . What the hell happened here?
Conrad, is it?
So... Can I have it?
No.
He forced me to!
Maybe this is what the pilot should be about, vomiting on somebody's vest.
What I said? I say stupid things all the time I can't go two minutes without saying stupid things.
I didnt know there was a fireplace.
Yeah, yeah. Speaking of crazy, did you hear about Lloyd Braun?
What was that?
It's mellifluous!
Hey! Surprise, surprise!
Where are all the poetry magazines?
Well I am actually going to have a secretary and I get to do the interview.
If anyone should be forced to leave that place, it should be her!
...meet the Mets. Come on in and greet the Mets.
What's so hard about that? How am I supposed to get it in there? I can't just walk in with it. I have to get the Rosses out of the apartment!
Anna actually has respect for me now. (laughs/snorts) It's all over.
A pig-man?
"It doesn't help"
This pasta primavera is fabulous.
Wait a minute let me call Susan.
Yeah, well....
Yeah, she's very lovely.
What did you do?
Yes!
Well, I'm doing it, Jerry. I'm buying the Frogger machine. Now the torch will burn forever.
So Scott's your roommate, huh?
Bozo?
Oh geeeee. (George pantomimes sticking a knife in his heart, and twists it.) Go, go!
(Depressed) Well,.. the Andrea Doria.. that was quite a fire. (Moves to the door, leaving)
Hi.
I don't know. I closed my eyes and made a move.
Jerry please, that's very nice, but, uh, (closes the door) where would we be going?
I find the soothing pastorial images very conduc-
Right now? "Jerry"?
Very.
Kramer. Guess what.
Well, you got no place to go. I'll tell you what your problem is You brought your queen out too fast. What do you think? She's one of these feminists looking to get out of the house? No, the queen is old fashioned. . Likes to stay home. Cook. Take care of her man. Make sure he feels good.
Snoopy and Prickly Pete. Should I keep driving?
What kind of hair?
So what have you been doing with yourself?
It's a blue Honda...
Jerry, can I talk to you for a second? (They enter Jerry's apartment)
Eight o'clock.
Thank you very much. (Peggy leaves the menus and walks away) So guess what I got do tomorrow?
That's right, of the New York Yankees.
Really?
You got hookers turning tricks in my car. How's that for starters.
The second time I sent the noodles back, I tought she made a face...
We really should be, uh, heading out..
What are you like a sadist? No matter how bad somebody feels, you can make 'em feel worse. I bet you're rooting for a tumor. (pointing to her)
I can't believe this.
Hey hey.
Yeah, I wish.
It's probably chocolate.
Oh...(is about to tell Jerry, but reconsiders) ...clothing, something, I dunno. So, uh, what are you doing today?
He..hmmm. humm...What about this one.
You put a hot tub... in your living room?
Are you going to help me or not?
'cause I asked him about the raisins.
He sold me ladies' glasses!
(grabbing lapels) J. Crew.
Alright, let's go.
All right. So let me ask you a question. Who was the man in the cape?
No, I can't. What if I meet a woman? I'd always be worried about that first moment where I'd take it off and see that look of disappointment on her face.
It's like going to the bathroom in front of a lot of people and not caring.
You mean, uh..?
Yes but then everything is all pulled down and it's jus.. Anyway. The damage, unfortunately, has marred an otherwise fine automobile, rendering it virtually undriveable.
Yeah, I'm gonna get a paper.
We were in the lobby during the intermission of the play. I was buying her one of those containers of orange drink, for five dollars. I reached into my pocket to pay for it, I looked down; theres this piece of green floss hanging from my fingers.
[sarcastically] Heh heh heh... So side-splittingly funny...
If I see things as they are, I would ask 'why' or 'why not?'
I'm emotional.
It's Susan
(Munching on a hamburger) This Arbys is good.
Hmm. Really? Nothing?
I know, but antiques are very popular right now.
Well you know what I've discovered Mrs. Sokol. It's not so much the looking as the listening. I listen for work. And as I'm looking and listening I am also looking. You can't discount looking. It's sort of a combination. It's looking, and listening, listening and looking. But you must look.
Wa, I'm not getting out of this cab
No. But I was the only one at the table that didn't get violently ill.
ho ho ho ho. You know I only got two weeks left of unemployment. I got to prove I've been looking for a job to get an extension
Yeah. The *original*.
Not.
Yo, Anna.
Were up to two dollars here.
No, no. No, no, no. It was not trash!
Where's Elaine?
You know, if I could get this Coco woman down to Kruger, they wouldn't be able to call me Koko anymore because Kruger would never allow 2 Kokos.
Gee, I'm sorry... I got here first.
Alright, I gotta go home and open up with the house for the carpet cleaners. You know they're doing my whole place for twenty-five dollars.
I'm going shopping with Susan.
I should be in a place like this. I envy this woman. Ya' get to wear slippers all day. Friends visit. They pity you. Pity is very underrated. I like it it's good. Plus they give you those word association tests. I love those.
Well, you know, to be honest sir -- my, my new secretary Ade, came up with that one.
Its unbelievable. You know what else is unbelievable? I picked up the check. She didnt even offer. She ended it. The least she could do is send me off with a sandwich.
Poor kid.
Wha! You know, it's a pain to change that. You gotta lift up that plastic thing with a pen.
Whatever.
I'm interested.
It stinks.
Oh, I just, uh, leased a house out in the Hamptons, and I have got to get out there this weekend and sign the papers.
You know, we're living in a society! We're supposed to act in a civilized way.
Mmm.
No sports jacket? I don't need a sports jacket? Writers wear sports jackets.
Dad, that other car cut us off! They had swastikas all over it... They were hurling racial epiphates at us... I could have been killed!
(thinking) Oh my God, it's 701. What have I done? My whole plan is depending on Kramer? Have I learned nothing? How could I make such a stupid mistake? He'll never show up!
Yeah, that's right.
So?
I just talked to Mr. Kruger, he'll be down in a minute. He wanted me to take a photograph for the record.
$2300.
Jerry and Elaine. They made me nuts.
Oh yeah, when are you gonna execute that plan?
Tell him to open it.
"Aahhrgh...it wouldn't take...... long pause, audience laughter) ten minutes from now, I'll be sweating all over again ,I can feel it. I'm a human heat pump!"
I broke 'em playing basketball.
(laughing) Have something else. Cmon, have a little dessert?
The one with the long sideburns?
Of course. Absolute zero!
Should we be talkin' about this?
...It was all a terrible misunderstanding, sir. Just five minutes. Just five minutes of your time. (listens) Thank you! Thank you, Mister Dalrimple.
And this is the first you're seeing of the coat?
Right out of the clear blue sky?
Oh, God.
I like herbal tea.
Of course it is.
Well, we.. we, we, ah..
I don't care. Look, Lloyd doesn't know what he's up against. This is nothing to me. (moving his arm) My whole life is a lie.
Maybe I could move them until you get back.
Yeah. Hmm. Boy these really do pinch. I tell you, if I ever find the son of a bitch that stole my glasses...
Give him the jacket.
Come on now.
Right. He cooks my food, he cleans my house, he does all my shopping for me. And there you go, that's your program.
I can't imagine.
(sings) Co-stan-za. (like "By Mennen")
I told them to meet me in front of my building at six-fifteen.
Right. I don't have it on me. Allison, this is Susan. Susan, Allison.
Milano.
Me neither. I've never been happy.
Can I uh, can I walk you back to work?
Who's he?
What?
All right, okay. Let's go, details.
I don't know....hmmm ha! here's the doctor.
Oh. What is this?
(worked up) I can't have a cup of coffee with a person?! I'm not allowed to have coffee?!
I know. This was the only woman I never lied to. Well thats not entirely true.
Ah! Peggy. Good to see you.
Then why don't you try and get him another job?
Why? What's wrong with the subject? This is a bad subject?
So just kick her out.
From NBC?
(excited) Yeah, the pilot!
What'dya got?
You shook my hand in that coffee shop.
me? "step off"
Gee, that's-that's too bad.
Yeah.
Yea.
There's no house! It's a lie! There's no solarium. There's no Prickly Pete. There's no other solarium.
You're a very handsome man, by the way.
Yes, I sure did.
(Pointing to them) Office Christmas gift. I tell you, this Human Fund is a gold mine!
Yeah, but they let me go on and on all about the Hamptons, they never said a thing! You don't let somebody lie when they know you're lying. You call them a liar!
No, but I can tell she's going to. I can sense it. We had this terrible phone conversation. I was so nervous before I called I made up this whole list of things to talk about.
Well, you know, It's interesting, you know, under that pressure, what you're capable of.
Yes, positive.
(to himself) Yeah, you said it. (to Wilhelm) Uh, excuse me, Mr Wilhelm. Uh, do you really think... Well, is this downtown trip really necessary, you know, for the project?
(Fed up with his parents) Actually, I think I'm pretty clear on it.
What do you mean?
George Costanza, assistant to the traveling secretary.
Where you going? I-I thought I could count on you for a little compassion.
Nooooo.
I go in to use his private bathroom, everybody uses it, and then I get a memo - a memo - telling me to use the men's room in the hall. Well, (laughing) I mean we share it with Pace Electronics. It's disgusting!
(Desperate to get rid of the book) Alright, I, I'll just take fifty. Do - do we have a deal?
So we jump and roll, you won't get hurt.
How do you know? What if pig-man had a two-seater?
(resigned) Dammit.
Not possible.
(singing) Master of the House/Quick to catch your eye/Never wants a passerby to pass him by...
Im nervous.
Okay. (Chewing) Thanks anyway. (Continues to chew as he exits)
Why shouldn't I?
Well the sex was okay, but I threw up from the Hennigans.
Yeah. You've heard of it?
(to Donna) Why did you have to get me in trouble?
Hey
Thank you.
Could we talk about this some other time?
The whole time that I was growing up, all I ever heard from my mother was 'Why can't you be more like that Lloyd Braun?'
He knows this guy, Wilkinson. He made a fortune in the stock market. Now hes got some new thing. You know, theres supposed to be a big merger. He wasnt even supposed to say anything. You guys should think about doing this too.
Well, don't they make a counter offer? How can they just cancel the whole deal like that? What kind of a maniac is this guy? I mean he just, he says no, and that's it?
A biopsy?
Still, I bet when they gave him a plane, it was a lot nicer than this one.
Um, you know Im starting to think that maybe lobster isnt the way to go.
Kramer was supposed to tie a knot
What about that?
So what do you want me to do?
I..I..I dunno.
I couldn't take it anymore.
I dunno sometimes...
I got a message from the Rosses at work today.
Sir, I just got a call from the terrorist. I told him to call back here.
Yeah, I'll zip in, "How do you do?", zip out. She'll love me.
Hey!
I think I was affected by the caffeine.
Loni Anderson?!
Ade you are incredible
Huh-Hi. (looks around a little) Uhm, is Neil here?
If there's any doubt, I do a leave-behind. Keys, gloves, scarf -- I go back to her place to pick it up...(pop sound) date number two.
(to Elaine) What are you doin' here?
Y'know there are tribes in Indonesia where if you keep your coat on in somebody's house, the families go to war!
Obviously.
(To Elaine) Told me the same thing.
(shout) Marisa Tomei!
Well that's the gist of it!
I--I've been, walkin' around all night.. I've been thinkin' about Allison and me.. an' you--
She bought.
I like Christian rock. It's very positive. It's not like those real musicians who think they're so cool and hip.
Where did you get those?
Ahhhh, Ahh, Ah, Ahhh, Ahh, Ah!
Oh, well, uh. Gary told me you said hi.
I walked in, your lobby door is broken again.
(visibly disturbed) I...I..I dunno.
So eh, you eh, wanna get together tomorrow?
Well, was it for Costanza or...
Well, so much for purification week.
It's a coincidence.
(To Rachel) And, uh, you eat eggs, right?
Those are my friends I was telling you about. We're gonna talk to them, pull over.
Was it a scratch or a pick?
Now, I'm aware that my own physical dimensions are perhaps a little short of perfection.
It's OK. It's fine. She'll do it. I'm sure she'll still do it.
Because you're a gymnastics teacher. It's only natural.
``Ponce de Leon''? But that was great!
(Holding up Kramer's book) According to this, it took.. 10 hours. It eased into the water like an old man into a nice warm bath - no offence. (Pause) So, uh, Clarence, how about abandoning this apartment, and letting me shove off in this beauty?
I don't think I've ever spoken to her.
Oh boy.
Oh!
Hey.
So did you enjoy your lunch?
"There may be a problem with the phone, hold on"!
Ech. What else you got?
Yeah.
Excuse me, are you gonna be very long?
Oh, I'm goin' baby. I'm goin.' (Heads for the door, then stops.) It's Jerry's fault. He took out all my good lines. He's such a control freak!
What are you talking about? How can you sit there and look me in the eye and tell that me you're not worried?! Don't you have any *sense*?!! Don't you have a brain!? Are you so completely senile that you don't know what you're talkin about Anymore!!?!
You don't work in the rain? Your a mailman."Neither rain nor sleet nor snow....."It's the first one.
Oh, the nose job. I don't know, what did you think?
. We should be having dinner with our sons when we're sixty.
Hey, Ring Dings are better than anything you're gonna get at a bakery.
Ah, alright. Believe me, that kid's gonna be called Soda.
Boy you are really smitten.
Oh, you are such a wuss.
[studying his jacket] Oh man! Look at this! I sat in gum. Oh, by the way, you owe me seven fifty.
(energetically) "Well seems it's about time for George's lunch."
Yeah, right.
Why? Maybe she liked me. I, I mean she was looking right at me. You know, I think she was impressed. You know, we had good eye contact the whole meeting.
I gotta get to Fowler. I know that he would take this squirrel off my hands. It's practically bionic!
Why didn't you say something then?
Yeah, and a whole new me. I'm up two inches in these babies!
Hey, I am not a prude sweetheart. I swing with the best of them. (snapping his fingers 5 times)
Buzz cuts? Parachute pants!
Hey, a "hit" is a totally different story.
She didn't help him?
Yes, yes,.
When I was working I spent baby.
What do you think I said?
But you didn't use a coaster, Jerry, you left a stain! (he runs to kitchen)
Well, thank you for your support.
Oh are they gonna be furious.
So, if I may jump ahead - you're gonna take dog medicine?
Is that what's hurting your appreciation for the story?
Oh, no. No. No. No. No. Nothing. I'm fine. Everything's fine. Fine. Just get a little nervous on the weekends, that's all. Could I, uh, could I get a glass of water?
So what do you do?
Good night, Stan.
So, she fell, and then she started screaming, "My back! My back!" So, I picked her up and took her to the hospital.
Oh, my god that's Saddam Hussein. The dictator.
I don't know, I like stuff you don't have to think about too much.
Oh, Im Im full of it Father.
[Accusingly] What's *that*?
Peter?
I can't hear you.
I was in there for two minutes. He didnt do anything. Touch this, feel that  seventy-five bucks!
Yeah.
I don't chew gum.
I think it's neat. You don't hear that much about god anymore.
The nickname. George. What is that? It's nothing. It's got no snap, no zip. I need a nickname that makes people light up.
Get a good night's sleep, alright fellas. (thumbs up) Big day tomorrow!
But if you think about it...26 teams, 162 games a season, you'd think eventually an entire team would get wiped out.
Why not?
Cosmo
(upset) Could you put a little thought into this? Jerry's gone, you could humour me. He humours me.
Alright that's it. (George walks across the room over to them.) So you get rid of me and now the two of you are going to sleep together?
You can stuff your sorries in a sack, mister!
I knew it.
I'm not going to see that nut doctor she went to Europe with.
He's not here?
Hey, you know what else is playing here? ``Rochelle Rochelle''.
(Rejecting) Ohh, no. No, no, no..
You can't leave! This is an ambulance! This is an emergency!
Yes?
What the hell happened to your shirt?
I've just met her but I'm very impressed.
How come youre not doin the second show tomorrow?
You don't care for Soda?!
Why don't we get them a couch? (Kramer laughs) Well rent a U-haul -- well bring em a nice sectional.
So I said, "Mr. Hayman, It's me george Costanza, JFK, ... " He doesn't move. So I said uh, "Can't stand ya'", "Can't stand ya'" He turns and smiles, the little baked bean teeth. I get up to run away, but something was holding me back. It was Heyman. He had my underwear. There I was on the steps of the 42nd St. library , a grown man, getting a wedgie.
Whoa! Whoa! Geez!
Get out of here. I didn't see any cameras there.
No no no, I got it.
You're Murphy!
Uh, here.
Im an architect.
Oh my God, its exactly the same!
You're out?
My name is George. I'm unemployed and I live with my parents.
Been there, done that.
But you are Blanche... You *are* in the shackles. Oh, I can't wait to read my *Time* magazine! Laaaast copy, too. Maybe I'll read it tomorrow-- in the park! It's supposed to be a beeyootiful day! Have a nice life... sentence, that is!
Prognosis Negative! (in a funny voice)
Yeah.
Shut up!
Is there ever a good time to have your parents stay with you?
Plans. Schemes. She ah, she keeps talking about getting back together with her old friends, you know - "the gang," as she likes to call them (chuckles), you know. Yeah, they're eh, they're hatching something, you can count on that.
You are a genius, it's as simple as that.
And I didnt even ask her out. She asked me out first. She called me up. What was I supposed to do? Say no? (laughs) I cant do that to someone.
She made a big breakfast every Sunday. I don't know what she put in those eggs.
Oh I'm going baby! I'm going! (he leaves)
Never mind what happened, just give me the key.
Alright, that's it. Alright, good, eight thousand dollars. (to Cynthia) Cynthia, again, nice meeting you. Have I commented on the shoes? I love suede, it's so thick and rich. Did you ever, you ever rub it against the grain? Alright, anyway...
Look, we're wasting our time here! We're a half-hour late, they've probably took it off the board already.
No, not a loser!
You know, about the uh, two of us getting together. And I know that I said I was engaged, but (laughs) uh, you know, it's really just something you say. It's like, going steady. You know uh, going steady, engaged, it's, it's all just stuff you say. (chuckles) Anyway, I was watching uh, My Cousin Vinnie, on the uh, on the tape the other day, and I was thinking that uh, you know, the two of us might take a meeting, as they say. (chuckles) So, what d'you, what d'you think?
Are you gonna move the car?
That's right...We just had sex......You know Jerry I've been searching for someone a long time. Well the search is over.
You wanted to see me, El Presidente?
Hey!
That's an interesting question.
Did anybody see Firestorm?
We did a crossword puzzle together, *in bed*. It was the most fun I ever had in my entire life. Did you hear me? in my *life*! Y'know?
So then he makes his own bed?
Morning, dad.
I was supposed to see her. She wasn't supposed to see me.
I don't know. She..She's having some problems with this guy she's seeing.
First time in my life I've ever gotten back at someone.
Oh!
You want me to ask one of the Yankees.
(chuckles) Really? Well, we'll just see about that. Ta-ta, Tut-tle.
(whispering angrily) Okay. Okay. Fine.
You gotta look at this. I pulled it in perfectly equidistant from the car in front of me and the car behind me.
No, not nice. She's stickin' it to me.
Yeah, well you have to maintain the same disposition too. You can't start acting any differently. You have to be nice.
Just tell her whatcha want, they'll make it for ya.
Here you go.
You mean just going there because I'm invited, that's rude?
Look at this.
Excuse me...huh... I think I made a big mistake. I'd like my deposit back please.
Napkins?
So, he made an appointment for me to see Dinkins' doctor. He's just trying to humiliate me.
Okay.
It took a couple of hours of convincing. I was persistent. I was just like those guys in the movies. And it worked! She said "Yes"! I can't believe my luck that she was still available . A beautiful woman like that. You think she's good looking, right?
He just walked away! And once again I'm standing here like a little man. Well not this time! (George leaves the store and follows the dog owner) You! Dog man!
Who's Bozo? Bozo the Clown, that's who Bozo is. When I was a kid, Bozo the Clown was the clown, bar none.
Yeah so did I.
Don't worry, we'll find something for you. (Knock of Jerry's door)
You don't understand. A garage. I can't even pull in there. It's like going to a prostitute. Why should I pay, when if I apply myself, maybe I could get it for free? (he hears a horn honking) What? What do you want? Go around me, I'm looking for spaces.
Well I still think it was wrong.
All right, believe me, you're not going to marry him.
This is by far the most exciting thing I've ever done.
Jersey.
You think?
I thought you were meeting Kennedy.
Sorry? Why sorry? What you got to be sorry about?
She's confiding in him about our dates. You always like the person you talk to about the date more than the date! It's just a matter of time till they realize, 'Hey, we could have sex.'
The Indian?
Yes, I've seen a silver dollar.
One little bite.
You think I'm going down?
Bring it on, baby
Pawn shop?
(Losing it) I guess everyone here enjoys giving the old screwgie, huh?! Youre all doin a hell of a job! (Looks longingly at the Twix in the machine) Ho, ho. What I would do with you..
June. Juune, baby!
All right, so what's the penalty here? Let's just pay the fine or something and get the hell out of here.
Jerry, where y'going? It's... what're...
So uh... been to a bris before?
Tommy C.
Ah, get outta here. The vomiting is much funnier.
Well take a look. It might not even belong to her.
There might be some moisturizer.
You don't know?
Now, listen closely. I was at the unemployment office and I told them that I was very close to getting a job with Vandelay Industries and I gave them your phone number. So, when now when the phone rings you've got to answer "Vandelay Industries".
Yeah, yeah, yeah we could. You know, ah, Kramer, the next time you talk to her, find out if she knows Kelly, from Monk's. I wanna know if she really has a boyfriend.
Knock it off, just sit in your seat over there you're distracting me. We're making incredible time here. I once went into Kennedy Airport from West 81st Street to in uh, in 15 minutes. hu uh. Oh, here hold this. It's uh, ten dollars for the tolls.
Because before you know it he'll be having lunch with him. You know how these interoffice politics work.
I told her. In the kitchen  which was risky cause its near all the knives. I started with the word Listen.
No, no, he mimed it. That's what was so funny about it.
So, you wanna go home and...make up, officially?
I don't even drink wine. I drink Pepsi.
So?
Uh. Cheese, pepperoni, eggplant.
Now, each of you is here because you're the best at what you do.
No, I didn't.
Elaine, what are you doing?
I don't know. He can be so weird sometimes.
Well I'm sure you have secrets from me. I don't know anything about your cycles.
Wait a second. (George gets up and heads for the statue in Kramers hands.) I cant believe this! Let me see this.
What are you? A *baby*!? All right. Tell her.
No, something's off here, you hesitated.
Oh, when is that car service coming?
(curious) Bald? Uh?
She had to be impressed by that conversation, had to! It was a great performance. I am unbelievable on the phone. On the date they should just have two phones on the table at the restaurant, done.
Yeah. So what happened?
Yeah.
When she goes to the bathroom.
I know you did.
You know, it's not the S.A.T.s!
I think I had some hard candy in there.
Where?
Yeah! Look at me! I was free and clear! I was living the dream! I was stripped to the waist, eating a block of cheese the size of a car battery!
You go in the living room. I'll take the test in here.
Yeah.
Ah oh? What? What Ah oh?
Dammit!
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm terribly sorry.. (Bends down, and starts picking up her things)
Your lawyer wears a cape...?
Jerry, Elaine, I give you.. Janet.
No (snorts - Laughing nervously)... I'm gonna wear black shoes.
Why?
Gonna see her again?
I thought you said one oclock.
You still owe me a secret.
Hello there. I'm George Costanza.
Where is he?
Whats seventy-five bucks?! What, am I seeing Sinatra in there?! Am I being entertained? I dont understand this. Im only paying half.
Ye - yeah. And we had a pact, you know.
Now, stop it ...
Uh, Jerry, you want your blankets tucked in?
Well, it's less than twenty-four hours, so I guess I have to!
Wait a minute, please--
They wanna have another meeting? They wanna buy it?! They wanna but it?! Oh! I tell you! We're gonna be rich!! What are we gonna get for this? Fifty, sixty thousand?
It - it's just that I'm here with my parents, and my mother wants me to take a civil service test - and to tell you the truth, I don't even think I'd pass it.. So..
He's a wig master
Hey uh, isn't Elaine supposed to meet us?
My mother loves Hampton tomatoes. She's nuts for Hampton tomatoes.
Jerry, I can't. It's like saying to Pavorotti, "Teach me to sing like you."
Elaine, don't interrupt, they're discounting something.
Well not really...
Mr. Pensky? Of the Pensky file?
Yes.
Thank you very much. Dylan?
How could they not notice it?!?
Yes, yes. Very smooth, super smooth. No, but I really wanna attack this thing, you know. Sink my teeth into it. So I was just wondering... what do you think would be the very best way to get started?
I'm very disappointed to here you talk like that. You still don't know what makes me tick.
Elaine.
(cocky laughter) Huh haha! (shouts) You're meat, Reilly! You just screwed yourself! (laughter) Ha ha!
(wiping the area with a hand) People think they're so important...
What?
Look at that. Theyre done!
Well, they get very hot in the polyester. You know, it's not a natural fibre. I think they would prefer cotton.
You don't have to pay for the massage?
(TO WOMAN) Hey, is that necessary?
(worried) Why not?
Wait, wait wait, not so fast. Jerry, you gotta take me to get this thing refinished.
Today. Im going today. Just dont do anything until you hear from me.
I'm not giving you the satisfaction. I'm gonna watch it again...
I'm in line to buy.
You enjoying yourself? (More laughs from Elaine)
That's it?
Ha, ha ha uh, I'm not following that.
Oh! Here you are. Ha ha...You, uh, you want to--
Standard?
Well, you know. (grins, snorts) It's understandable.
I tell you everything, right?
Well, I just had a fight - I need a group dynamic.
I said, would you like to go for a walk or something.
Well...I was in the locker room showering, and I...I had to go, so...
Well, I'm the good boy again. Can you believe that?
He purposely mispronounced my name. Instead of saying, "Costanza" He'd say, "Can't stand ja". "Can't stand ja" ... He made me smell my own gym socks once.
It's more than the meal!
Hello. I'm O'Brien.
All right, enough! Enough! From now on, no more yada yada's. Just give me the full story.
Yeah. What's that?
Well, you didn't hear it from me, but needless to say, if you go in there - stick with the consumee.
What could I do? Did you see the mug on that kid?
(angrily)"WHY WEREN'T YOU MORE CAREFUL WITH YOUR DROOL!"
Prognosis Negative! (again in a funny voice)
Pssh. Yeah. Right.
Oh! I know....'Cos you don't think Janet?..
(singing; imitating Tony Bennett) You know, Id go from nods to nothing...
You've never heard of Bozo the Clown?
No, I won't.
So, we watching the movie, or are we still talking? (Joe's wife shakes her head and goes into the other room. George gestures to Remy to move.) Okay, c'mon. Let's go.
That's true.
But I'm backing in! You can't put it in head first!
Alright, this is what ya gotta do I need ya to go out to the parking lot at Yankee Stadium, take the flyers off my car.
Oh, that's wonderful.
All right, I made up the part about the car, but the rest is true. And he hated me anyway!
Yes. Live, dammit. Live! Every precious moment as if this was the last year of your life. Because in many ways...it is. (There's a knock at the door.) Excuse me.
I noticed people staring at my head because they like what they see.
(angry) She won't sweeten, and I'm bitter!
Great! Great! I actually just had two meaningful intelligent conversations with Corbin Bernsen and George Wendt.
What are you kidding? We look great! You know what this pudding needs? The skin on the top, you know like your mother used to make it on the stove.
Don't you see what this is?
Divorce is very difficult. Especially on a kid.
A player?
Well, what should I do, Kramer?
What about them?
I lost them. I can usually come up with one good comment during a meeting but by the end it's buried under a pile of gaffs and bad puns.
Elaine.. I have to tell you something...
I'm back, baby, I'm back!
I did!
Keep going.
I dunno.
Well does it say anywhere in the contract about my car being used as a whorehouse? 'Cause I don't remember reading that clause either..
Yeah.
You never had sex in the office before?
14 months. Maybe 10.
Well, of course they're trying to screw you. What do you think? That's what they do. They can make up anything. Nobody knows. "By the way, you need a new Johnson rod in there." "Oh, a Johnson rod. Yeah, well, you better put one of those on."
All he has to do now is count his blessings, say a prayer, and he's done. Do you believe this?
I knew you had an appointment.
No, what?
Not bad? It's gorgeous!
Ridiculous!
(Muttering to himself as he walks to the bedroom) More stuff..
(Sheepishly to Elaine) I'll be right back. (Leaves)
The truth. you want the truth? It is your earrings It is the chopsticks but it's so much more. You're pretentious. You call everyone by their full name You call my doorman, Sammy, "Samuel" but you didn't even say "Samuel" You went "Sam - U- EL" Papie-eh Mach-eh What is Papie-ay Mach-ay?
Of course hes been in touch with him. Hes left two messages. He just hasnt heard back yet, thats all.
Yeah, yeah. She's seeing this guy, Art Vandelay.
I gotta prep. I need a couple of anecdotes, a few you-were-right-abouts. It's a whole procedure. Wasn't Fragile Frankie the one that used to run into the woods every time he got upset?
I gotta get out of this city.
I've gotta go to the bathroom.
She asked about me? What did- What did she say?
What, is he crazy?
Guess who he put in charge of Fitted Hat Day? Me.
yeah
well I don't know if there's gonna be any place to eat up there
What, it didn't bother her?
Nah.
Mmm... no.
Not bills.
Yeah.
What?
me too, I am down, I am totally down, mark me down
Drink up. (Levitan takes a drink)
Yeah. Hey, let ask you something. Is it just me, or - or do you find it unbearable to be around Jerry and that girl?
So you - you really don't have my hat?
And she'll still see it, you're not stopping her from seeing it.
Who?
What is that? Is that cashmere?
Yeah.
Of course. We all do.
I was seven and a half.
That's exactly what I'm trying to avoid!
What? You can't leave yet.
Oh no, I can't do it. I-I'm not good at these things, I get flustered. Once I tried to bribe an usher at the roller derby, I almost got arrested.
Why, you think you can, beat me up?
After consummation.
Woah, back it up, back it up. Beep, beep, beep. Tractor story?
Jody's nice.
Yeah! Yeah.
Hey! Uh--listen--did you get your--uh--boss's Knick ticket, for Kramer?
Hey that's swell.
Keith called you?
Oh what's the difference? We'll all be dead eventually.
(sobbing) yodel lay hee hoo..
It says very clearly, 'for your protection, do not give your secret code to anyone.'
Ohh, hey there, young fella. (They shake hands) What's your major?
Dad. We need to talk.
Yeah, here you go.
(Only turning back for a second) Hey.
I am not O'Brien! I am not O'Brien! I'm not O'Brien! Ask anyone! Jerry?! Jerry?!!
( to Jerry) What about the letter, should I think about the letter?
Oh my God. I must be crazy. What have I done?
I can't get a massage from a man.
Celia's up for parole.
You lie! How hard is it to lie?!
You mean one of those vinyl things?
Yeah. Just take 'em out and ride 'em around for about..half an hour.
Hmm-hmm, not by a long shot. I'm calling up the Rosses and inviting them up to my non-existent place in the Hamptons. Then we'll see who blinks first.
Yeah, Like I don't know that I'm pathetic.
But this is Pavarotti!
Well why'd she do that?
I can't tell ya how much I appreciate this.
She's right, I heard Kramer got mugged out on the suburbs on a baby-sitting gig.
(pointedly) She could do a lot worse than Mr Peanut, my friend.
I know. I know.
Supposed to close with the swirl?
How? Cause Im an Idiot.
No-no Jerry. I wouldn't do that.
Hey Elaine.
Oh man! I knew I was gonna love the opera.
(still in Jacks voice) I'm working on my Jack Nicholson, You can't handle the truth! (he salutes)
Something happened to the food?
Yes. Now take off those pants.
It wasn't funny.
Hah.
No, I dont want it. I want it, if you dont want it.
What, you don't want me to hold your keys?
Oh, yes of course, come in.
(gasping) I think I swallowed a fly! I swallowed a fly! What do I do? (He turns to a coffee shop patron at the counter.) What can happen?!
(to Jerry) Oh, get outta here.
My parents. It's their anniversary. I'm taking them out to dinner and a show tonight. You think we'll hit traffic?
I can't believe it. Look, that's Jerry Seinfeld.
Wha.. you ran?
The network executive. You think she liked me?
T-bone steak.
I love it! This is fantastic! Look at this couch, is this velvet?!
Yes! I see enormous potential here.
Yeah, yeah, sure, Christmas. Snow. Santa. All that stuff.
Oh, the guy's got some perspective there.
"I have to go see Steinbrenner later. Mr Wilhelm told him that I was the one responsable for stealing all the merchandise."
You sure?
Well, cause we were just saying we were going to ask you to come up to the country with us this weekend. Susan's father has a cabin up there. But, eh, all right, well.
I went in with a pretty woman? You know, kinda short, big wall o' hair, face like a frying pan?
I was squinting! Remember that drive from Wortsborough? (snapping his fingers) I was spotting those raccoons.
Oh, she's a Kramer. And uh, while I was there I uh happened to pick up another juicy little nugget about our friend.
Oh, I'll pay. Half-price. Arrivederci my fellow 40-short.
Well, it was a hell of a ride.
Are you coming back down?
How's it going?
How come you don't know what street are you on?
Yeah.
But Jerry, this is not coming out!
(Like a kid) Because I don't want to.
She probably gets that impression because you're cool. You're under control. Like me. Nothing wrong with that.
My car! My caaaaarrrr!
What happened to you?
Why don't you see someone about it?
(Leading Nina out the airport) Oh, no. No. We're good. Let's get goin'. Alright. (Almost bumps into Jerry) Watch it, funny man. (Leaves)
(playing with toys) Ahhhh, Yes! Touch down! Your turn, Jerry. (hands Jerry the Mattel Football. George starts playing with the Etch-a-sketch.)
S-Susan
how did I know you were here? Something drew me here. This is phenomenal.
Good Morning!
It's disgusting--
Yeah. Steinbrenner wants everyone in the front office to give a lecture in their area of business expertise.
Maybe I'll buy it.
Yeah. yeah. I-I know.
Why?
Get out of the car!
It's an early Christmas present.
(shouting) Fire!!
Jerry? I have to tell you something. This is the dullest moment Ive ever experienced.
She's ahem....gone
No no no, this ones different. This ones a beauty!
Oh no, Morgan is a good man sir.
Alright, alright! We'll buy her a wheelchair! Wheelchairs, engagement presents.. IT NEVER ENDS!
Yeah, phew.
(pause) Alright if you think it's too much they don't have to mail the postcards.
(oozing fake sincerity) Well, as much as I enjoy all the good-natured ribbing, nothing really makes me happier than spending money on the people I care about.
Sir?
Oh, real good. (George makes a face like you stink) Any word from NBC?
No, I fake limp on my right. This is a real limp because I sprained my ankle.
For 50 bucks? I'd put my face in the soup and blow.
Superman's father on Krypton.
Why? What do you mean?
What?
Hand modeling? (Shakes his head 'No')
She said that?
What's the worst thing that could happen?
Its Martine. I think hes dying. He tried to kill himself with pills.
...Huh?
Oh, great.
You know. You use the, uh...(mutters something unintelligible under his breath.)
(Pause) Yeah.
I am an art-adorer! I adore art.
(Annoyed) Yeah, yeah. We'll, uh, let you know.
Well this is bad. I am really in a bad situation now.
You can stuff you sorries in a sack, mister!
So?
I'll make time, because Abby, I was once like you; wide-eyed, naive, I didn't know the first thing about a subject as fundamental as risk management.
Jerry, I'm gonna kill you!
Hello everybody.
It's open!
Well, I join them in their grief.
There are some people in this room who would have been very happy to never see this briefcase again. There are people in this room who think they can destroy other people's property and get away with it. Well, let me tell you something about those people. They weren't counting on this brain! And this tape recorder.
It's Jerry's fault.
So you're on the speed dial?
Me??
Oh, not more building.
You've got a prayer.
You got bumped from career day?
Very exciting, very exciting, it's like watching a birth.
I can do six weeks standin' on my head. I'm a sexual camel. That's not the point. At least there was the possibility.
I'm stuck. Pull a little, just a second. Don't start the train! Don't start the train!!
Was she uh, was she a big, uh woman?
Then I got off the phone right away.
Korea.
You look like you're five years old.
(Pleading) Please, please, they're gonna hit me! (Attempts to grab Helen's purse, she starts hitting George defensively, he backs off)
I am eating my dessert. How do you eat it, with your hands?
He-he was uh touching and rubbing. (nervous laugh)
Mr.Wilhelm...
What if there is a fire?
As a suspect in a serial killing.
Who?
(on phone, as Jerry gestures beside him) No, Lindsay, I had accidentally spilled coffee on the gentleman's windshield. Why would I do that? I have a job! Well, did she see a squeegee? Well, you're not going to make a dime without a squeegee. That's right, that's right, just tell your mother it was all a big misunderstanding. You won't regret it. Okay, I'll see you later. Buh-bye. (hangs up)
All right, where do you want it?
You know what, bad mistake my mistake do me a favor go back to the other lane - you'll never get there - forget this lane - y'a kn ow what this lane stinks - go back to the other lane - bad decision - go go go take this light - take this light -
You're not goin to do it? What do you mean, You're not goin to do it?
I have no choice, I'm quitting.
That's... what we used to call him in high school, the exterminator. He's a linebacker. Oh, did we have some wild times.
This could be in a museum some day! It's not safe with me! It should really be in a doormanned building.
All right. I am happy, and I'll tell ya why -- because the two of you were making me and every one of your friends sick! Right, Elaine?
What happened to you?
and JERRY Yeah.
Oh, nothing much. You know, I went over to Jerry's. Talked to Jerry. Um, could I talk to you for a minute?
Y'know. About *us*.
Why is that?
Fine.
No no.
Alright! So, she said, that she could've fixed me up with her.
They could kick me out of the health club if he tells them!
Oh my God, an affair. That's so adult. It's like with stockings and martinis, and William Holden. On the other hand it probably wouldn't cost me any money.
That's uh, KL5-8383. Are you calling them soon because, they keep very strange hours.
What, you don't think I can attract beautiful, intelligent women?
That's true, that always happens to me.
Lemme see. I can't believe you got these for free. (Looking at the tickets) Row F?!
"Double-dipped"? What are you talking about?
You see I disagree. I'd rather be dating the blind. You know you could let the house go. You could let yourself go. A good looking blind woman doesn't even know you're not good enough for her.
I never heard of that.
(delighted) Jerry? It was incredible! Models! As far as the eye could see!
I'm gonna do it.
Wheret?
Oh, sorry.
You can't, it's a textbook.
What is this?
(thinking of the moans) Heh. (Karen takes another puff of her cigarette) You seem like you really enjoyed your Risotto. (chuckles) You have a very contented air over there. (chuckles again) You look very contented, very satisfied. (pauses) Are you satisfied?
Yes. Yes. Care. You know who I think about a lot? Remember SUSAN ? The one that used to work for NBC?
What?
Hey, maybe this cheating thing is what I could use to ditch Maura.
So, uh, how long has this been going on?
You have my spare-key in your apartment, right?
What are you doing? You're robbing me?
What for? . I'll tell you what for.... for hair.
Where are you living? Are you here? Are you on this planet? It's impossible. It can't be done.
So how was it?
Jerry and Elaine saw you.
Do you think it might be possible to add a little shelf like, uh, for an alarm clock?
She any good?
What was wrong with that? I had a different interpretation! Do you know anything about this pretzel guy?! Maybe he's been in the bar a really long time and he's really depressed because he has no job and no woman and he's parking cars for a living! (out the window to honking cars) Alright! Alright! Shut up! Shut up! I hear you! I'm coming down! These pretzels are making me thirsty!
Hey. It's me.
Hey! What is your problem?
This line is huge.
Yeah. I'll see you later.
Well, Jerry doesn't want anyone to know.
(animated) N..no, no. You can't leave me. (frantic) Marry me! I'll burn myself. I'll burn my parents!
(shouting) I'm not looking for another line. I got the line.
That's right. He just happened to be the previous owner of the vehicle.
(shouted after Elaine) You know, I got nothing outta this!
I have nothing to say to anybody. I'm so uninteresting. I think I'm out of conversation.
So why didn't you tell me?
Maybe you should call your car phone.
Excuse me Ms. which street are we on?
I really think it looks good.
Anyway, so he gave me his spare keys, now he wants to have my keys, so I need mine back from you.
It's a huge problem, Jerry. The hardest part about having sex with a woman is getting her to come back to your place! He's already got that.
Well they're hard to load.
I hope so. I can't take him living with me much longer. He makes this kasha, it stinks up the whole house.
You know a hug definitely good.
Oh, he'll be here. By the way, Elaine, (reaches under the table and brings out a large coffee machine) thank you for laying out for the Arabian mocha java.
Well, I like a rolling writer. They're very smooth.
...Are you sure?
I said, Listen Marlene, and then the next thing I know, Im in the middle of it. And theres this voice inside of me going, Youre doing it! Youre doing it! And then she started to cry, and I weakened a bit. I almost relented, but the voice, Jerry, the voice said, Keep going, keep going. Youre almost out! Its like I was making a prison break, you know, and Im heading for the wall, and I trip and I twist my ankle, and they throw the light on you, you know. So, somehow I get though the crying and I keep running. Then the cursing started. Shes firing at me from the guard tower. Son of a bang! Son of a boom! I get to the top of the wall  the front door. I opened it up, Im one foot away, I took one last look around the penitentiary, and I jumped!
(pause) What do you think, Jerry.
(head down low) I...I wouldn't know"
Shoplifting.
Maybe you don't have to be so funny. I mean, would it kill you not to be so funny all the time? That's all I'm asking. This woman thinks I'm very funny. Now you're gonna be funny, so what am I gonna be? I'm gonna be a short bald guy with glasses who suddenly doesn't seem so funny.
(through a mouthful) Long as they don't throw 'em on the field. (laughs) Huhu. (indicating dish) Help yourself to some shrimp, I brought enough for everybody.
Yeah...
Hey, hey! Yankee game! (Changes the channel.)
Get out of here, why?
Every night at six-thirty. The nurse was gorgeous.. then I got a look at the patient.. (Laughs, then snorts) I was going nuts.
What ever they had. Miranda thinks I'm a butcher but i-i-it's not my fault is it? Don't we have a deal with the pigeons?
What is a barometer exactly?
Venetian Blinds.
I don't know.
Told you.
So what, what is so bad about that?
(Reluctantly) Well, okay.
Well, that's not offensive. (Reflects) It's abnormal, but it's not offensive.
Well, I'm sorry, Timmy...but I don't dip that way. (takes a chip.)
Really?
945
but..why, it wasn't my fault, I .. you asked me a sandwich, I .. I make such delicious sandwiches Elaine
'Things'll be great, when you're...'
I'm trying to get out of this Big Brother program. So when you get to Paris (handing Morty the postcards) all you have to do is drop 'em in any mailbox.
And on your dates.
What about her place?
Oh Jerry, that is so sweet of you but actually i already ate.
I don't know, honey. What do you want to get? [in babying voice] I want you to get anything you want...'cause I love you so much. I want you to be happy. Okay, sweetie?
I'm sorry! I'm terribly sorry! I- I-
You know, I don't see how you can sit there eating that and not even offer me any?
So I spoke to the security guard.
Ill just, uh, get a paper...
Bovary! (points finger again at Jerry)
I think it's "on the wagon".
Reparations!
He wants to meet you? I'll tell you what. I'll show up. He doesn't know we're friends. I'll pretend I haven't seen you since High School. I'll back up the story.
(Definite) All together.
Was there any nostril penetration?
So, how was the trip?
Yeah. Well, maybe not Elaine.
Yeah. I don't think they'll be able to tell.
What happened to Babs. She never showed up last night. The whole thing blew up in my face.
(Jerry-style) That's a shame.
No. That's disgusting!
All right. Let's go over it again, one more time.
Wha..wait a minute, wha..what about Reilly?
Aah, hey. (enthusiastic) If this works out, forget about it. Vacations together, movies together, dinner together. It..it's almost as good as if I didn't get married.
Of course it's cashmere.
Funny guy, huh?
What if the pilot gets picked up and it becomes a series?
Do you believe this? We're fighting. We're fighting.
Oooh.
You're Batman.
What the hell is a gander, anyway?
Wow. So what're you gonna do?
What the hell are you two talking about? (All exit)
I see what you mean.
Can I finish?
(Opens the door, looks in and then knocks 5 times) Mr. Steinbrenner, (waves) can I talk to you for a second?
Thanks, see you later, Donna.
(Stopping him) Ah, excuse me. When your, uh, when your wallet was open, I - I glanced inside, and I couldnt help but notice that you have several crisp dollar bills.
(slightly worried) You know, I'm starting to get a little nervous about this lunch.
(talking to nobody) I like horses. Maybe I could be a stable boy.
Jerry Seinfeld. My best friend. He can explain all of this. (calls to Jerry) Jerry.
Okay, we'll go!
Discovered the Mississippi.
Sure you can.
..So, one thing lead to another..
Clark Bar.
Not at all.
Oh shut up.
Ah hah. You see Father, Im Im incredibly anxious to become a member. Um, dont you offer any kind of an express conversion? A quick change?
He's got a gun! He's got a gun! Get out of the way! (Tries to flee the bar in a mad panic. The audience in the club also goes nuts and heads for the exits. Jerry stands onstage, perplexed.)
Did she say anything about, uh...
This is unprecedented!
I told you.
I got it from the Institute. The Institute.
Yeah. No problem.
What?
No no no, you know actually we are friends of a serial killer.
Not that much.
Oh. How's the guy?
Oh, don't tell me. Lloyd?
(standing) Yes, payroll. Yes I did. Very productive. Payroll... Paid off.
No, I dont care.
Yeah, yeah. You really cashed in on that favor pretty quick.
(admiring himself in mirror) I did.
From the bathroom.
A-ha.
You think she would care about the red dot?
(annoyed) Not a peep. They just cleaned the carpets and left. Call themselves a cult!
He started it.
Thats it.
Look...humm..I'm on with Beijing with the hair restauration clinic. Could you talk to them for me and tell them I'd like to place an order.
Well, I'm sure they'll be able to fix it. You can't stop modern science. Can't stop it, you can't stop it. Can't stop science. Can't be stopped, no way, no how, science just marches--
I'm not going to break a hundred on this thing.
Are you sure?
Nah, nah, it's uh, it's a long story. Just uh, try to get it up.
Yeah.
Whatever.
Of course I'm all right. I'm here with my girl, Nina. And what better way to pass the time than gabbing with my best friend -- with whom there are no secrets. (Flashes two intertwined fingers) Like this. Since the fourth grade.
I'm cheap? You think I'm CHEAP? How could you say that to me? I can't believe this. How could you say that to me?
Thanks Mike. Nice to be aboard.
(Muttering out, not really wanting to talk about his family) When the Costanzas came here, one brother stayed behind.
I want evens.
Who cares about eyebrows? Is she sweet? I like sweet. But not too sweet, you could throw up from that.
Well get it back! It's very important. (winks)
Sometimes it's good to have a pencil to write these things down.
Oh, come on! Be sensible.
This is the thing where you go and you have to make your own pizza?
I suppose if I had suggested Liam Neeson Day, you'd all be patting me on the back.
145!
Hey, by the way, if anybody wants an inside tour of the zoo, Siena works there as a trainer.
Oh! Dropped a napkin...(Whispers) Jerry!
I could never do that. You know the ironic thing is if she had a smaller nose, I never could have gone out with her in the first place. She'd be out of my league with a smaller nose. And I really like her, I know that. And I know one other thing. I'm not getting past that nose.
Sand. It's everywhere
Who goes to the Super Bowl with their mailman?!
You know -- Elaine.
You just gave them to him two days ago, he's gotta give you a grace period.
One mile from the exit it starts shaking, really violently shaking, like it's having a nervous breakdown. It completely stopped dead.
All right?
Kramer, what are you doing?
Boy oh boy.
Wait a second. 'Little places to go, where they never close.' What's a little place that never closes?
Ttu (wipes nose and sniffs) Ttu.
People smoke, Elaine. My mother smoked. It didnt hurt me.
The weather guy, Dr. Waldo.
They were in here, I saw her put 'em in here!
It gets here when it gets here. Would you stop ridin' me?
(Complaining) I can't read it. I need my glasses!
And I can make a left turn from the right lane too.
(whistles disapprovingly) Ho ho ho, Had to? Had to come in?
Hey, listen don't oversleep. You can't afford to be late again.
Conveyor belt.
Totally folksy.
Then of course with evolution, the octopus lost the nostrils and took on the more familiar look that we know today.
Well George . . . .
Is it with a "y"?
The guy slept with Marilyn Monroe, he's in Dinky Donuts. What about this doctor's note? Let's go see your friend Roy.
I didn't do it! It..It just got done. I don't know how it got done, but it did.
Yeah, what the hell?!
Face up on her back?
Pst. (moves in close with Elaine and Jerry) Wilkinsons got a bite on a new one. Petramco Corp. Out of, uh Springfield. I think. Theyre about to introduce some sort of a robot butcher.
Let me ask you something. When you go into a store, does it bother you that they make the security guard just stand there all day?
We are going to the Knick game! Michael Jordan!
Really?
What, he can't jump out of the chair? How long does that take? Here look at this. (he moves to the end of the booth) Here, watch. (stands up) Criminals. Boom. I'm up. (pretends he's shooting) Stop It! Stop It! Stop It!
Really?
Hello! All right, we should be going. Come on...
Yeah.
Five thousand... Ten. Ten thousand. Five thousand.
Well I didnt do it for my mother.
Oh right, right! The blue sweatpants! Gees, it's too bad you can't say anything because of Angela.
Nothing.
What? Is that bad?
Really?
Make myself comfortable. What does that mean? Does she want me to take my clothes off? Is she taking her clothes off? What if I take my clothes off and she still has hers' on? Then I really look like an idiot. She could get offended and leave. So maybe I should leave them on, but what then if she takes her off? Then she'll feel humiliated. 'Make yourself comfortable'. I got this unbelievable woman and this 'comfortable'-thing can ruin me. I got it! I take my shoes off and sit on the bed. There, that's comfortable. She can't accuse me being unconvertible.
Oh my God, I forgot to tell you. I got a letter today from the State Controller's Office. Y'know when I was going to public school back in Brooklyn, every week I used to put fifty cents in the Lincoln Savings Bank.
hey, you know what? I just remembered something. I had a dream about that guy last night. This is amazing.
How much?
Must be one of those rich, spoiled handicapped people, who didn't want to do any work, and just wanted to sit in her wheelchair and take it easy.
The comedian, or the manager?
See her tonight. See her tomorrow. Go. Knock yourself out. Shes too crazy for me.
I still don't see why you wouldn't eat me. I'm your best friend.
(panicked and rushed) Jerry! The Japanese guys had sake in the hot-tub! You gotta get 'em outta the drawers and get 'em down here, or I don't have a focus group to sell the pilot to Japanese TV!
Now if I wanna see anything I gotta wear these.
Does Neil like to eat a big breakfast?
Take it right off the chest...
Why don't you just look at your watch?
I'll give you a quarter.
Pleasuring you?
I have to do this, it's a matter of honor.
It says that on the computer?
That condom killed me. Why do they have to make the wrappers on those things so hard to open?
...Huh!
Yeah. Eric the Clown put it out with his big shoe.
(over the speaker) It's George.
He's got Marlon Brando's. I could go to Marlon Brando's house if I really wanted.
Right.
No, I'm gonna hold it under her nose so she can smell the scent of stale Bosco that I had to live with for three years, and I'm gonna say, "Remember this shirt, baby?! Well, now, it's payback time!"
Where did I get the coffee? Where do think I got the coffee, at the grocery store. (small laugh)
The woman she's "lesbianing" with? Susan told me she's *never* been with a guy.
She wants to keep it quiet. She... thinks we have a real future together.
How you gonna catch him? He's probably boarded the plane already.
(in the threshold between the living room and the kitchen) The thing that bothers me the most, is the lying.
What!?
(Praising Leo's stealing) Alright, Leo! Stickin' it to the man!
Oh, the big race.
Greetings, people. Greetings. Greetings and salutations. What a beautiful day for a ball game. Let's play two! (Sits down, says to waitress ) Oh, I'll have the chicken salad on rye, my usual, you know what I get, darlin'. (Turns to the Gang) So, let's see, I had a little conversation today with Mr Don Mattingly - (to Elaine) he's the first base man.
No, I'm fine. I'm good. I'm very good.
It's George.
Alright look, I'm gonna tell you, but I made a pact with Cynthia, we swore we were not going to tell you and Elaine.
(surprise) What? I..I didn't hear about that.
It was very traumatic. The last thing I remember is you flinching. Then, everything went black.
Oh no you didn't. Get out, when?
No, no. That's just the thing. Anna told me that Elaine said I was one of the worst seeds she'd ever seen.
(Not wanting to make Elaine mad) I guess it's not important.
(To himself) How am I gonna do this? I'm engaged to this woman? She doesn't even like me. Change the subject? Toilets were the subject. We don't even share the same interests.
So you feel okay?
Look, I'm gonna go to the bathroom...
What are you saying?
That?s not the issue, we're friends, if I?ve got to be uncomfortable, you've got to be uncomfortable too!
Me? You see what he did here, you see how he tried to sneak into my space?
You think it's contact? It has to be touched?
What am I talking about? Come on. (laughing) You don't think I bought all that? (does a little move)
Yep, this one for our side!
Wa, uh, thank you sir, you know I am not quite sure I'm right for it.
(grabbing the sweater back) Well it's not really damaged. 85 dollars huh?
Did you feel that tension? We use to have banter - (puts menu back with frustration) - there's no more banter.
I think things were going ok. We were having a nice conversation.
(Stern, trying to shut her up) Ma.
Oh don't-
Well, I wouldn't want you to do that. You know there's a lot of losers out there.
Hi, nice to meet you.
(confused) What, what's going on?
You don't tell him?
(Shocked) She's pregnant? Leslie is pregnant?! Oh, see, there is no justice.
What choice do I have?
It's just that I was the one who actually paid for the big salad. She just happened to hand it to you. But it's no big deal.
Well, didn't he regift the label maker?
Oh, come on! You gotta get me over there!
Hey, hey, let's not get so defensive here. This is a give and take process.
Hey hey.
When are they gonna have the flying cars, already?
Alright, whatever! Now. Whatever caused the damage...(drops a tiny briefcase onto the table in the model)...was jarring enough to completely stop the tape.
Dark and disturbed? His whole life revolves around Superman and cereal. I convinced him to act like that so that you would think I was funnier. That's how disturbed I am! If you want disturbed, that's disturbed. You can't find sickness like that anywhere, you think sickness like that grows on trees? Nobody is sicker than me, nobody. He's pretending, I'm the genuine article.
What is with this dog, I thought we were taking it to the pound.
(not expecting the statue to be thrown) Dit.
(offers his) Oh, you want to taste mine.
Why not?
(shocked) What?
(taking out wallet) Well, let me. Heh. Let me just eh.. check an', make sure I have the right man--ha! Heh, heh, heh! Seems--oh! I, oh! (has conveniently dropped the photo into her view)
Yes it is! You're very charming!
Why did the policeman have to yell at me like that? (Elaine enters)
Yes. She's got great skin - a rosy glow..
--Astroturf? You know who's responsible for that, don't you?! The Jews! Ah, the Jews hate grass. They always have, they always will.
Mr. Thomassoulo during times of great stress, people are capable of super human strength. Have you ever seen the Incredible Hulk, sir?
Well, why didn't they ask me?
You know my driver's waiting, I really should get running. Good to see you guys again.
Huckleberry, Raspberry...
The little extra moan you threw in there. Laying it on a bit thick, don't you think?
Quick for a... catered affair.
Would you stop that? It's not safe to be jumping up and down on a plane.
(smiles) Beats the hell out of coffee.
Id like a doggie bag for this please. (hands her plate to the waitress)
Yes. Thank you! Is that so hard?
Maybe like this.
I would? What if something happens?
What if it rains?
(hurried) I'll see you.
Excuse me, I've got a maniac stalking me, I'm not staying in the city.
What does that mean?
I just wanted a second opinion.
My cousin worked for Bouchard's. They used to use the bouilla-base for a toilet. (Jerry and Russell are shocked.)
How could it still smell after all that?
Ah, not yet.
Why did you refuse the package. Everybody loves a package.
Hey, thanks. I owe you a big one.
"Off the wagon"?
Hey!
He's alright?
What?
(Showing an example) What'd you do today?
What?
(getting up and leaving) Alright! That's it for me. Goodnight everybody.
(Suggesting) Maybe she's a nudist. You know, those nudist colony people..
All right, you know you're not any help at all here. I don't know what even the point is of talking to you anymore.
Oh, yeah, sure, laugh it up. Everybody else did!
Till I'm comfortable.
So?
Well, I do what I can. (Robin comes over.)
When is it going to be my turn, Jerry? When do I get my 15 minutes? I want my 15 minutes!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Oh, I, uh--
Look, Deena, I know you think I'm crazy, but I'm not. This is just a series of bad coincidences.
Ow!
(admitting) All right..
What's he going to do? That's exactly the point. Nobody knows what this guy is capable of! He fires people like it is a bodily function.
They are?
No, no,
( becoming more and more awkward) Yeah.....
Where is she?
(enters) Hi.
You can't tell him the truth, you're gonna blow the whole thing.
Let me just call him.
No one gives us the finger! We're Yankees!
Uh... hey. I'm gonna get going.
What kind of money you think your parents have?
Give me the phone. (dials) Yea, Hi I would like to speak to Patrice. ... what? ... oh really? ... oh, ok, thank you, ... (hangs up)
Well who doesn't.
(animated) What're you kidding me? We were all getting along so well. Where is all this coming from?
D'oh...Oh, oh, the judge! I hate this guy!
Ahh, Hey-Ho. ahhhhh (exhales)
Well, what are you gonna do?
Would I have had access to that?
And now?
Hi, hi, hi, You were wonderful.
Well it's not up my alley! It's one thing if I make it up. I know what I'm doin, I know my alleys! You got me in the Galapagos Islands livin' with the turtles, I don't know where the hell I am.
Should we tell him we're leaving?
I shouldn't even tell you this.
Why don't you call her agency. Maybe she's been out of town and she didn't get the calls.
Yeah, hell be looking at us like hes backstage at a puppet show.
Whose are these?
(cont'd) she says, We have to talk.
Well I, uh, I'm not sure how you pronounce it or anything, but I, uh, I believe it's Mnage  Trois?
Well I'm not starting up a whole new wardrobe now!!!
(Frantically, takes phone and screams...) He'll call you back.
It's very complicated.
That's my vow to you.
OOuuoo! They could use the break!
I'm very nervous about this. I've never spoken to a mental patient before.
Me?
(Nervous) Nothing.
A mute would be good.
I can't. He's been on my case about not paying attention. Besides, it's too late, I already told him I heard him.
I got up, I was supposed to go to work, I came here instead.
Implied.
(George is telling a story. Karen is laughing and she seems to be the only one to find him funny) So I go into this clothing store and the saleswoman is wearing this (whistling) low cut thing. So I said to her "Can I ask you a question? When you put on a top like that, what's your tought process? What's going on in your mind?"
(Sitting on the sofa) I'm on no sleep, bro.
Hu, oh. No he thought I was hiding something from him about Morgan.
Yeah. Hey, you know, I gotta go get these tomatoes. You wanna go for a ride?
Yes we will.
We just go up to him, we say, "We're O'Brien."
Well don't let him take advantage of you like that.
I gotta go help her tape up all his boxes and get them ready for shipping.
Out of the question.
You can't just walk into a building and say " I wanna be a talk show host."
I hope I am.
(adamant) It's not cheating if there's no sex!
(to Jerry) Whos going to play left field?
What?
Busted cold.
Maybe she moved it up in the rotation.
Susan Davis? (Getting possessive) Hey, wait a second..
(almost gleeful) After Dinkins lost the election, he had a complete nervous breakdown. They had to lock him up.
(from the intercom) Yeah, its George.
sweetheart, no come here,  sweetheart
Well...I'll ask Susan about it later.
(agitated) Alright, I gotta try and talk my mother into taking him off my hands.
Hey.
Yeah. Where's he taking you, by the way?
C'mon, funny is funny.
Senegal?
(checking his watch) Hey, let's get the check, she's taking the bandages off at four o'clock.
He said what?
It's one think to not give me the extension But to tease and to torture me like this. There's no call for that.
Parker, I never said driver, I said parker, a great parker.
(not believing him) You what?!
(Stern) No, ma, I'm not gonna see a psychiatrist. N- I don't care if you do pay for it! No! Discussion over. Yeah, alright, I'll see you later. Yes, of course I'm gonna come by. Alright. (Hangs up, slamming it down on the coffee table. He sits down next to Jerry) My mother wants me to see a psychiatrist now. Why?! Because she caught me? (Scoffs, shaking his head) You know, if everyone who did that had to go see a psychiatrist.. (Laughing, he snorts)
Wow. Uh, what do I have to do?
What?!
Oh, you're fine... you're fine. (looking at Tom in the back and then quieter to Jerry) So you think this guy playing Kramer took the raisins?
If anything happens here, can I count on you?
Ah! Health's not good enough. I want more than health. Health's not doing it for me anymore. I'm sick of health.
Hey!
(excited) Ho ho! (gestures and steps towards bedroom but Loretta walks the other way to the couch)
Yup. It's really just a question of what kind. Thinking about a bar stool.
Ah, shut up.
They're worse! They're much worse than us, they talk about everything! Couldn't you at least tell her about the shrinkage factor?
Now you're off on a topic.
OH MY GOD!!!
You see.....WHAT!!
You got bit by a strange dog and you didn't get a rabies shot?
What?
(knocks on the window) Hey, why are all those people milling around my car?
(In awe) Wow!
No, not at all...
(Once again, Identifying) The Outlaw of Josey Whales!
Woody mentioned me? What did he say?
Yeah. Really.
What, Minelli's!?!
Like what? What could they say?
What are we gonna tell her?
I'm losin' it
So you don't think she really has a boyfriend?
(on the phone) Oh my God.
She probably never heard it. Don't you see what this means? It's like the whole thing never happened. It's like when Superman reversed the rotation of the earth to save Lois Lane!
Uh huh. Uh huh! I think you spoke to your little friend Rachel, that's what I think.
I went to look in the mirror, it wasn't there. You threw off my equilibrium.
A-ha, huh. (mumbles) tours.
(looking over her resume) Well Miss Coggins you're ah, obviously qualified for the job. You've all the necessary skills and experience. But you're extremely attractive. you're gorgeous. Im looking at you, I can't even remember my name. So ah, Im afraid this is not going to work out (he crumples her resume into a ball) Thanks for coming in.
Maybe it's not even stupidity. Maybe it's just a blatant disregard for basic human decency. Yeah this how dictator's start. Do you think Mussolini would circle the block six times looking for a spot?
(animated) What're you talking about?! She's very concerned! She said she was gonna get it back.
Ooooh, yes they do.
(angry) Well, that's the name!
Ya. That's what she told me.
Well, it's all for charity, so what's the difference.
No! No! Turn it off! No feats of strength! (Gets up and starts running out of the coffee shop) I hate Festivus!
Ohh.. Paco! (Flicks rubber band tward the kitchen) Hey, take a look at this. (Hands Jerry Kruger's check)
(Standing up) Yes. This is wrong!
Well, anything I can do to help, um...she's a wonderful girl. Very smart. Very eh...crafty.
(pointing outside) Why is there a Cadillac parked in front of the house?
Still marry , still marry.
Why can't we share?
A table right here.
(pops his head out of the covers, looking a bit confused) Uh...you know, uh...pleasuring you.
Witness.
Are we really doing this?
Oh good, good, come in. Come in, welcome. I'm George. And this is Jerry, over there, on the phone, that's Jerry. And you are, um?
Name tags! Name tags! What kind of an idiot thinks anybody would be interested in an idea like that.
(innocent) What?
Huh?
I'm sure you are.
I didn't.
THIS is your daughter? My God! My God! I I hope you don't mind my saying. She is breathtaking.
Elle McPherson going to be there?
Do you believe this guy?
No, no I don't think so.
Moose?
Uh, yeah, I'll be there in a minute.
Wait a minute, wait a minute, do you think I?m comfortable here. I can't change, I?ve got no clothes here! You've got to go like that, I can?t go like this alone!
Jerry, I like being with her. Plus, I know where she is all the time. I have relatively no competition. An-and you know how you live in fear of the pop-in?
No, no. I'm not going on.
Have you seen 'em?
(laughing it off and trying too hard) Yeah, yeah. I have a thing for Marisa Tomei. Like she would ever go out with a short, stocky, bald man. (forced laughter) Hu hu, ha ha. Like that's her type. Huh. She's an Oscar winner. (nervous laughter) He heh. Besides, I don't even know her. It's not like anyone's trying to fix us up. Who, who would try and fix me up with Marisa Tomei?
I didn't say 'We're Ted Danson.'
(On his way out) Heh, heh, heh. Thats what they want you to think.
I'm just asking, all they have to do is say no.
Yeah, I mentioned Simons. Next thing I know, Im in the parking lot. Perhaps they had some sort of a falling out. Ill tell you one thing. I dont know what hes got. But for a sick guy, hes very strong.
Everybody likes pesto. You walk into a restaurant, that's all you hear - pesto, pesto, pesto.
Man, would I like to see the look on his face.
You know, the uh...(mutters it again.)
All right, all right, calm down, calm down. Whatever happened in the past is past.
An' wait'll you see the dress that she's got. It's backless! Uh?! I'm finally gonna make a Great Entrance!
(frantic by now) SHUT UP,SHUT UP, SHUT UP,...(then leaves)
And get a picture of him, with his shirt off.
Look who's here!
Actually, I did have a thought.
Why not?
All right, All right, keep your towel on.
So, uh, Mom, Dad, I was hoping that you could help me to remember my childhood a little clearly..
Ma, guess what!
Well, I'm sure you'll find something.
No. (dips the chip) You dip the way you want to dip...(bites the chip) I'll dip the way I want to dip. (dips the chip again.)
(looking uncomfortable) Um... yeah! Sure, sure I'm interested.
Well, I wanna put a picture of me and my boss Mr. Morgan up at the office.
I've said that before?
Ah Ha.
That's pretty pathetic.
(Stern, angered) I hope so. (Takes the scissors)
What...are you using my babies now?
No, it hit the table, it hit the table.
Where did this come from all of a sudden?
Seven!!
Alright, what's the difference. What are we gonna do now? He won't take our calls, we can't get into his office...
(Hangs up phone and pauses) this is great! He fired her! This is incredible, he fired her. I'm out, baby! I'm out!
But you took me back.
Hello? Amanda. Hi, yes. Listen. You know, I'm thinkin', we might just be better of bein' friends. Yeah. Yeah, you know what, I can't even really talk about it right now. Bye-bye. (hangs up) (happy with himself, but then sees the burned up photo) No! No!
You think your parents would have any objections to taking a little kid to Paris with them? (Jerry looks at him confused) It turns out that the kid's father lives in Paris. (chuckling) Is that a coincidence? (Jerry smilies) Eh you know Alec wants me to take him over there so I figure as long as they're going (claps)
Geez.
Yeah.
You know, you know what's great about our relationship?...It's not about looks.
So I finally stop and say, "Tatiana, I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but I think it would be best if I left".
I could have had some ice cream. I think that might have calmed down the nachos.
Some other time.
Yeah. And since you go buy there everyday. I was hoping that we could help each other out.
Thank you very much. (Walks out)
So, I'm gonna steal another one, and then return it. That way, everything is even.
Because you were being so nice.
I told you those trips were relationship killers. Too bad you cant get your buddy Superman to fly around the Earth at super speed and reverse time. Youd get all the money back, you could have avoided the whole trip to Vermont...
(Gets up, stopping him) Woah, woah, woah! What are you telling me for? You really had me going, there! C'mon, sit down. (They both sit back down) What do you want to do when you grow up?
Well, he is. I, uh, I live around the corner.
No, stings the throat. Anyway, so I was coming along here, and I felt like a piece of cake, you know? But then I thought, it's morning, I should really have a muffin. I like those chocolate chip ones. Then I figured, well, they're really both cake. So I, uh, I sat on that bench for a little while, twenty minutes or an hour, and then I figured, check and see what you were up to. (a thought occurs to him) Wait a minute, wait a minute. The broad jump! The broad jump over the pothole on Eighty-sixth Street!
Yeah. I got 'em down to fifty bucks. I just have to do all the jackhammering myself.
Yes, I have a problem with paba.
Play Now thinks I got problems in both legs. My own personal Rascal, Jerry. On the house.
Yep. I'm leaving first thing tomorrow morning.
Not the feats of strength..
She's working late that night. We're - were supposed to have dinner with everybody at eight o'clock so I'll set up the ride for seven o'clock.
What?!
But suddenly, a new contender has emerged...
No, no, no. Out of the question. I was over there today. He's got the good spot in front of the good building in the good neighbourhood. I know he's not gonna wanna move.
Slippery Pete. Kramer, hurry up!
All right, dammit, I'm in.
Because ballpark food doesn't count as real food.
Alright, just forget it.
On an elevator? You met a woman on an elevator?
Wow. What'd you say?
(Confused) Flagged?
Uh. (smiles) Where's the boys?
(Not sure what the answer should be) What do you want to hear?
Why don't you just get some Ring Dings from the liquor store?
A drafty apartment? A... sweaterless friend? A ball-game giveaway Metlife windbreaker?
I still have brill cream.
Yeah. Hey, thanks for doing this.
Oh.
I can't go in there. Im too uncomfortable.
(whispering) Glenda, can I ask you a favor? Can I have this seat?
Wink.
You really think so?
They wish. I hate the big broker-houses. Hate them with a passion. Big broker-houses killed my father.
I'd go to prison as your accomplice. I'd have to wear that really heavy denim. Go to the cafeteria line with the guy who slops those mashed potatoes onto your plate. Go to the bathroom in front of hundreds of people.
Well, well, I had a dream, Jerry.
If you go now, I know what's gonna happen. We'll find the car, Jerry will show up, and then we'll never find you.
(gesturing with flyer) With Spartacus?
(cuts into Jerry talking) Chocolate chip mint? Oh well, actually Jerry I prefer chocolate chip. What is it about the chocolate and the mint that makes it go so well together?
Why didn't Kramer pick it up?
(To himself) Oh my God.
It's a broad noodle.
Really?
Wh..what're you doing here?
Alright, maybe four.
Stopped dead.
I can never get the package open in time.
Why didn't you just tell her?
I dunno, I'm in a limo. (dials) Hello ma? It's me. Guess where I am. In the back of a limo. No, nobody died. It's a long story, I can't tell you now. Because I can't. I said I can't. If I could, I would. Would you stop it? Alright, look, I'm getting off. No, I'm not telling you! How's this? I'm *never* telling you! I don't care! No! Fine! Never!!
Eighty-six, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, ninety, ninety-one... Yup.
Well, sir, I - I gave out the fake card, because, um, I don't really celebrate Christmas. I, um, I celebrate Festivus.
What is that, Boyfriend? I don't understand that. What, what does she think I asked her out for?
You only went in front first 'cause you saw me backing up and you didn't have room to parallel park!
You're blown?
Hey, Jerry, what was the name of the exterminator who fumigated your apartment when you had fleas?
Yep. And it didn't take very long either.
I said, do you like ice?
ahh.....!!
She dragged me down to that warehouse on the waterfront in Brooklin to see one of her "performances".
Ah... (quietly)
Yeah well, we don't think.
I'm not paying for this. If you were going out with her, it'd be a different story.
What are you, Crazy? I can't ask the guy for more cigars after you burned down his cabin!
So you didn't turn her in?
You could do worse!
I like history. Civil War. Maybe I could be a professor, or something.
I feel alive, Jerry.
I heard they found a family in your freezer
(to Jerry) Well, what d'you think?
You want my friend to ask his uncle, a man who just lost his wife of 44 years, for a death certificate so that he can save a few bucks on a flight?
(George, finger in the peanut butter jar) This is what I do.
I got some cufflinks I could've loaned you.
Excuse me just for a second. ( fixes his hair looking at his reflection in a coffee pot.)
No, no that's ah, that's pie country.
You're *selling* the car!?
No, can't say as I did.
Come on, Im tired.
Oh, uh, "The Falconer" by John Cheever. It's really excellent.
Theyre my books.
I doubt it. You know what he's doing now? He's putting a pool table in my old bedroom.
Yeah.
(To guard) Tired?
If she doesnt show up, we cant possibly have dinner with him alone.
During that period when my folks were separated he went a little crazy.
(Interrupting) No!
I don't understand, how do these thieves start the car?
I have to have my tonsils taken out.
Hey, I know what I'm talking about. I gotta be honest with you, I gotta tell ya... Ever since I saw you holding hands with that woman, I can't get you out of my mind.
Me either.
I don't know.
Well, I was exaggerating a bit, just for effect.
No, I would have picked up on it. I can always tell when a woman likes me, they always somehow let you know. With me, they could torture me, I wouldn't tell them. If anything I'd try to make them think I don't like them, then they think, "Oh, look at this guy, he's not even looking at me, he must have something going for him."
Hey (sees the coffee stain) Art Garfunkel?
What?
I got a headboard.
They saw me walk out.
And people come in the store and you get involved in their lives.
I guarantee you that Moses was a picker. You wander throughh the desert for forty years with that dry air. ... You telling me you're not going to have occasion to clean house a little bit.
You knew? How did you know?
Yada.
Oh, share.
All right, all right ( Goes to the bathroom)
You never run out, do you? (Jerry smiles.) Where's Kramer? Everything's finished here.
The guy that stole my glasses. This time I got 'em! (George follows the man onto the street, dragging the blind man with him) Would you pick it up a little?
(doing the voice) La la la.
I've been to the movies.
My name is not mentioned in this blurb...
So we order lunch, and were talking. Finally, she blurts out how its not working.
Ow! Hot! Hot!
So, um, you've read "The Big Game", have you?
Really? At the tennis match?
I don't know why I bother even talking to you.
Manhattan Memorial, less of a line.
I'm out! Fantastic apartment right across from mine, huh. I can't wait for you to see it.
(Mutters) Oh.. okay.. talk to you later.
So, uh, gentlemen, do we have a deal?
He's getting phone calls here now? (he's standing near the counter and eating chips out of a big bag)
Yeah, that's what I want-- triangles. Alright, I'm outta here. Have fun with what's-her-name.
Yeah. see you later.
Still getting nothing!
Okay.
Yeah, like I'm going to risk my job with the New York Yankees to make a few extra bucks. (winks)
I've coupled! I've coupled!
Yeah, I should do the opposite, I should.
I wanna know what I did to this woman.
We are really late now. We're in big trouble. Big trouble.
Beautiful women. You know they could get away with murder. You never she any of them lift anything over three pounds. They get whatever they want whenever they want it. You can't stop them.
A stock.
Me? I didn't say anything.
This is horrible.
Oh, well...
How's her handshake? A little firm, isn't it? Maybe a little too firm?
(resolved) Why not. (determined) If she can't find me, she can't break up with me. And, if we're still goin' out, she has to gooo to the ballll.
Wait a minute, call the car phone, see what happens.
It's exciting, isn't it? She's gonna have a whole new face.
I'm getting married?
The story is the foundation of all entertainment. You must have a good story otherwise it's just masturbation.
(animated) You're letting him have a woman over?!
Oh no, Mr.Steinbrenner, I can explain...
Of course.
Hi.
(forcing a laugh) Hu, ha.
I am. Im a nice guy. And she seduced me! We were in my apartment, Im sitting on the couch, shes on the chair. I get up to go to the bathroom, I come back, shes on the couch. What am I supposed to do? Not do anything? I couldnt do that. I wouldve insulted her.
Yeah, I told her to call me here and to tell anyone who answers the phone to ask for a balding, stocky man with glasses. I better tell him I'm expecting a call.
Here. Let me take your tabe downstairs for you.
Did you say, "The rines are crossed?"
Don't worry, don't worry, no scenes.
I'm not stable? I'm like a rock. I take these glasses off, you can't tell the difference between me and a rock. I put these glasses on a rock. You know what jumps into most people's minds? Costanza!
I'm sure we're all aware of the flaws and biases of standardized tests..
I don't know, uh...
Like at the airport? (getting excited)
The plane's been re-routed *back* to Kennedy. We've got 45 minutes.
Na, he's gone. I wonder what happened to him.
Why shave every day? It just grows right back.
Blanket.
(frantic) Jerry! Jerry, muh--muh--my hair-dryer ruined the picture! An' I need another one or I can't get back into the forbidden city!
Umm, Im not. Its just a sociological experiment!
That's where I come in. Umm, on splat. Uh, you see, Mrs. Sweedler, or is it hospital administrator Sweedler?
Yeah, that's right.
Wow! The weekend.
No its a regular religion.
Bert... Har... bin... son. Bert Har-bin-son.
I feel like I got a B12 shot. This is like a taste explosion!
Ooh, so what?
Come on! No doctor would put that on his car.
What?
I think I understand this. Jay Peterman is real. His biography is not. Now, you Kramer are real.
Well, I didn't really think about what I was gonna do with all..
Something, nothing, I could care less.
What do you think?
You haven't even seen one.
Yeah, like that.
Ow! What are you doing under there? Hey, stop that! Don't eat that! That's not food! (to Robin) He's suckin' down Equal packets!
I tought I picked up a little something. I'm very good at this. Did you pick up anything?
Drink your soda! Come on! I know you're there, laughing at me. Laughing and lying and laughing! I had to go to Reggies, Jerry! Reggies!
What are they saying now?
That's what she says. I say, listen. It was an old cat. It died of natural causes. So get this, now she tells me that I gotta buy her a brand new cat. I say listen, honey. First of all, it was a pretty old cat. I'm not gonna buy you a brand new cat to replace an old dying cat. And second of all, I go out to the garbage, I find you a new cat in fifteen seconds. I say, you show me an autopsy report that says this cat died of starvation, I spring for a new cat. So she says something to me, like, uh, I dunno, get the hell out of here, and she breaks up with me. Now don't you think that would be a great case on L.A. Law?
Could be the leaves...
Kramer, I really owe you one.
God, I'm starved, I'm weak from hunger.
Dogs, twists, a kind of fermented chicken drink.
(Slowly backing away, he's not at all committed to the conversation) Yeah.. television.
Oh. The summer me.
Costanza. Costanza.
(chases after her) Wait a minute! You're--now you're getting a divorce because she's from Long Island?!?!
No, I didn't hear anything.
So, what are you saying?
(worked up) Stickin' it to me, Jerry.
Hey uh let me take you're coat.
You fixed me up with a bald woman.
I want to know how did that get into my car?
Right. So I call her up, I tell her its me, she gives me an enthusiastic Hi!
Its a Twix! Theyre all Twix! It was a setup! A setup, I tell ya! And youve robbed it! Youve all screwed me again! Now, gimme one! Gimme a Twix!
Really?
So you really understand my point about building a rocket and double-parking.
I dont think theres ever been an appointment in my life where I wanted the other guy to show up. (George notices an elderly man in a leather chair.) Wait a second, is that him?
I don't think we should see each other any more.
Who?
Well,,, it's getting dark.
What?
All right here you go.
Do you know how much this is going to cost me?
(gritting teeth) Yeah, sure.
Why him? Why not me?
(frustrated) Take it easy! Huh! Take it easy!
To do what?! Work in a post office? Is that what you want me to do?
I learned a lot about myself.
When I find that guy, this much I vow those glasses will be returned to their rightful owner.
I got to go after her.
So, they go off for the ride, by the time they come back the bread is there.
Oh, this guy tried to sneak into my space.
I dunno, Jerry somethin's missing. There's a void, Jerry, there's a void...
I still don't understand this. Abby has a mentor?
My regular face.
You're in the movie? Is he in the scene?
(Hands still out, even though they've stopped looking at them) What happened to him?
Well, why would the guy make up something like that? Of all the names he could pick, why settle on Jon Voight?
(on phone) . It's George Costanza. . are there any messages for me? Why does Mr. Steinbrenner want to see me in his office? . . . Communist? I'm not a Communist . . . . All right, all right. All right, I'll be there. - ( hangs up ) My secretary Ada, told Mr Steinbrenner I'm a Communist Now he wants to see me in his office.
Please, it doesnt look good. Boy, boy, girl.
It's GEORGE.
...you're very attractive...
(standing) Not yet, but she's weakening.
Phil, I loved those cigars! Incoming! (Flicks his card tward Phil)
Why not?
Well, at least we know the prosthetic squirrel hips work ... sorry bout the set.
Learn guitar, first lesson free? Huh.
Yes, the surprise blindfold greeting. That wasnt in the manual, I dont know.
No, no, no Elaine.
Sorry, we're a little late. We got so hung up in traffic.
You know Ava's gonna be there.
You hurt me.
That damn delicatessen that - that is last time they screw up one of my orders.
You know, I think I'm a little bit scared of her. She's five-three, like a hundred pounds. I'm frightened to death of her.
I am? What a strange coincidence..
What about these?
You know. (All three give him blank stares) I was alone..
Well I just got the estimate. It's going to cost more to fix that roof than the car's worth, So I'm going over to see that hospital administrator today. Someone is gonna pay for this damage and it's not gonna be me.
(upset) Well, you've scared her off. We may never see mom again.
Whatcha got there, the 4-volt? Heh, I did you a favor.
Nah - what for?
All right.
They're selling coffee, bran muffins.. you're surrounded by reading material. It's entrapment!
Well, people never give a good 'hello' at a funeral. I mean, they go like this (George gives an extremely understated nod) That's the biggest.
Oh, that's the worst part of it. He looks just like me.
Looks pretty good.
Yeah, they eh, they do a lot of baking up there.
Well, I'm not buying it. No way. Forget it. No way I'm buying this! (beat) I mean, look at it! What is it? It's a bunch of squiggly lines! (beat) Are you telling me you couldn't paint this?
(Still holding the note) I think I'm having a heart attack.
Hey! Kramer.
I can't believe I didn't push for this sooner.
I don't see any way around it.
Hu-Yeah, interest. It's an amazing thing. You make money without doing anything...
Why was he wearing a cape?
Years. When we were kids, they made it seem like it was right around the corner.
Or we could get them together. Woo!
All right, let's postpone it. Let's get out of here.
Hehe. Well, I got my triangles. (sitting on the couch)
(shouting) How d'you not like Soda?! It's bubbly, it's refreshing!
No, the Portuguese waitress.
Huh, No kidding?
And then assuming the strike is resolved, on April 14th, we, ah, play the Angels. So lets clear a floor at the Anaheim Hotel.
She thinks I'm ugly. I knew it.
Im not doing that.
Oh, it's locked?
I'm feeling something else here, Jerry!
Jerry, I gotta talk to you.
You didn't like it?
I heard what you said "Sharon, are you there?".
Alright, Lupe, bye-bye now.
Would you wait a second? Just wait? (They fight over it.)
Well, I know when I'm a little strapped, I sometimes drop off my rent check having forgotten to sign it. That could buy us some time.
How did he do that?
Yeah.
We hardly read anything!
(thoughtful) I have no idea.
So eh, what do you say?
Tough.
I slipped on the invitations...how's the towels?
Oh, this is fabulous. My God Elaine, you have to taste this.
They're not here! You cost me fifty bucks!
(Loud, so everyone at the wedding can hear) You slept with the groom?!
How'd you hook up with these guys?
You got a line in the Woody Allen movie?
What's with the gloves?
Why not?
I bet they're probably doing summersaults about us over there. You think they get butler stories like that everyday? (He calls Susan)
Sorry, you don't know what's going on out there! (looks at Owen) Who's he?
Oh, so now I have to buy this whole chair by myself?
Well, maybe it was Ghostbusters? Where ever it was, it worked!
You know how hot it gets there? Like 150 degrees. Your skin is gonna be simmering with boils.
My receipts! The chair! My tiger poster!
So, what's wrong with him?
What was that all about?
Jerry, . . .
Yeah, let him chew on that for a while.
Oh, no, no, no...you sit right here...I will get you a nice snack.
You wouldnt believe it. Rasputin.
Yeah
Not with that big glass window looking out into the hall. I'd love a good nap. That's the only thing getting me out of bed in the morning. I'll see ya'.
(Angered) Fine. I'll ask you again when you're rested.
Yeah, so what?
I'm George.. George Costanza.. I've never been in the hospital a day in my life.. except when I had my tonsils out. You know, they never gave me any ice cream. I always felt that-
He's a great writer.
The movies. Blimp is playing right there.
There putting in a lost and found because of me. There's a time limit but still.
I think he was trying to tell me something, like it had some sort of a meaning.
Oh, oh. Uh, you know. It's the damndest thing. I, uh, I moved recently and my files, pfff, disappeared. Now, I-I don't know if they fell off the truck or if there was some sort of foul play but let me tell you something. I'm not through with that moving company.
Jerry...
Did I tell you?! Did I tell you?!
Hey, I saw what I saw.
I got him Yankee's tickets! He got me a piece of paper saying "I've given your gift to someone else!"
And your wine.
You have to stand tough sir. That's why I had to hang up the phone.
No something is bunk and then you debunk it.
(singing as he exits florist with bouquet and a cup of coffee) "...tootsie, good-bye. Too-too, tootsie..." (takes a drink, makes a face, shouts back at shop) You call this coffee? (dumps out coffee behind him, accidentally hitting a parked car's windshield)
This is it! It happened to me, Jerry! I was sitting in the restaurant, the two nut jobs were talking - I couldn't take it any more. I got up, and (Makes a noise) I bop into this woman..
Anyway, I think the guy in the shower opposite saw me. He gave me a dirty look.
Well so what's the problem, you just put some newspaper down.
What do you mean?
It will be my first one.
Ah, here it is.
I was wrong, you were right.
And you really believe this guy doesn't want to have kids.
Ya
This is a fantastic place! I always thought it was a meat packing plant!
Alright. I'll run it by a few people.
Y'know if the guy dies, the art could really be worth something...
I mean, how funny is this?
He was really crying?
bowling! what do you say bowling? bowling's insane! bowling is crazy time
Might be easier.
(animated) Some guy. Some guy? Neil! I have got to find out how he could get a girl like Danielle.
I-I-I-I-I got it!!!!!
Someone's have to unhook the boat before it leaves...the place!
Yeah, yeah. Well, I guess I started losing it when I was about twenty-eight right around the time I made my first million. You know what they say. The first million is the hardest one.
Pasta primavera.
(hearing Elaine over the phone) What, she's out?
I said 'God bless you'. Was that so wrong?
Well, I was buttering myself up for a nice shave --
S, uh, Superman - he, uh, built the fortress of solitude up at the North Pole, to, uh, you know, sort of get away from it all..
Yeah, the super glossy. The best they had.
She must have seen me eating it on TV.
I don't know, I was starving Jerry!
I'm moving to California.
What?
Why can't we do this on the phone? What's Kramer doing now?
You got your own shampoo, conditioner, body lotion! Jerry, body
Do you feel funny? He didn't say anything.
Hey, it's Georgie.
(panicky) What are you gonna do? Are you gonna call the police?
You mean a blessing in disguise?
Well, I wish I could say the same, but I must say, with all due respect, I find it very hard to see the logic behind some of the moves you have made with this fine organization. In the past twenty years you have caused myself, and the city of New York, a good deal of distress, as we have watched you take our beloved Yankees and reduced them to a laughing stock, all for the glorification of your massive ego!
Come on over and sit down.
(to Kramer) This man is a genius. Genius!
Hey, go.
What do you know? You were in the nut house.
Well ...... but how do I get someone else fired?
It's good, right?
Your own show?
Who said anything about money? (intercom buzzes)
Friars.
Hey I'll get married if I have to. Al Netchie will think twice before he opens his mouth about me again.
Did they take anything?
Didn't hear anything...
(shouts) Awright already!! This is a very key issue with me, Jerry. I had this name for a long time.
Yes, I agree. I hope my parents go long before I do.
(contemptuously, imitating Altons voice) Hes in the bathroom.
Yeah, right.
(on a pay phone) Hey, hey, it's George, I need ya to do me a favor.
We got a chocolate malt in here!
(Takes a sip) Hey, it's not too bad..
So, you didn't think this was a date?
I'm sorry, uh, it's not like I'm gonna see something I've never seen before.
Bother, wa', what kind of bother?
Then, the last person to leave is Wilhelm. He sees my car, he figures I'm burning the midnight oil. Between the two of them, they think I'm working an 18 hour day! (he stands there with his hands on his hips, a wide grin - laughing.)
So, were talking, and I dont like to go too long before I ask them out, I wanna get it over with right away, so I just blurt out, What are you doing Saturday night?
Oh, pudding! You want some?
Ahhhhh...
I'll fight ya! Not the face! Not the face! (The struggle continues.)
She'll Twirl.
All right Superman's the exception.
(Still focused on the nudist) They're naked, the gardeners naked.. the bellhops. (Jerry makes a noise of astonishment) One big nude-a-rama.
(CONT'D) Look at the time, that's it.
Ha, uh,
Assistant to the General Manager!! Do you know what means?!? He'd could be askin' my advice on trades! Trades, Jerry, I'm a heartbeat away!
We, uh, we go on foot from here.
Bring it on!
Im a weed in Hitlers bunker.
Right. The other members of our party. (closes partition) Other members of our party? What other members of our party? I didn't even know we were in a party. Oh, I'm telling you, the jig is up.
Yeah.
You're incredible.
(impatient) What about Marisa Tomei?!
It wasn't that bad.
Who told you to sell the card?
How much is that?
(enthusiastic) And, you know, I do a lotta business with Japanese TV. They broadcast a lot of American baseball. They got an office here in New York!
Hey, hey, hey! It's not Lupe's fault, you shouldn't have left it out.
What paper does she write for?
Oh, yes. I - I'm your baby bluey.
Yes, he's a clown!
Payroll project. Wilhelm? Big uh, big payroll project.
you put him on the spot
Rudy?! That skunk, I knew he didn't burn those clothes.
Susan, Susan would you wai,....
Oh, shut up!
Ha! (snort) Can you believe it? (amused) I'm supposed to be havin' lunch with her right now at Pomodoro.
Whats the rent?
So she's gorgeous.
I happen to dress based on mood.
Bread.
You think it's something?
I told you.
Oh! That's good judgment. That's a pile of judgment there. Sure.
A tractor.
Well, maybe she decided to celebrate her birthday on the Monday after the weekend.
Well, I am not going.
Yeah, but get this, the message said 'call me if you have the time'. Heh heh if I have the time, you get it?
He just read it. (Russell vomits again. Jerry and George look ashamed.)
This good be so sweet, Jerry. Saving lives? She's one step away working at the clinique counter!
Youre a back-up, youre a second-line, a just-in-case, a B-plan, a contingency!
MOOPS
(Nervous, his voice cracks) Hey, Antonio. How's it going?
Yup, y'know, they really spruce up the apartment.
Yeah. It's a beautiful name for a boy or a girl...
(defensive) So what? So what if I do?
How could anybody be so selfish and inconsiderate!
I will not blow this.
Na....no ... This relationship he..he..has got to be about something and fast or I'm in very serious and weird trouble....hum What else happened?
Reality tour?
To hell with Elaine!
I couldn't help it! Elaine moved the mirror, I got discombobulated.
Come on, lets go!
20 thousand dollars?
No, an old friend of ours, Gary.
(urgent) Move a pinkie, if it's yes. Can you move a pinkie?
It's fine, it doesn't have to be about nothing.
How are they gonna make that book into a movie?
How'd your foot fall asleep?
Where'd you go?
I'm gonna hit the head.
(Panicky) Uh, yeah. You know, Doctor, I gotta tell you, I feel a lot better.
Yes, but I still don't feel right about letting you into Kramer's apartment without his permission.
And you threw it out the window?
Who am I going to tell? My mother? Like I've got nothing better to talk about.
Yeah. Right.
It was kinda fun. (Elaine gives Jerry a cold cloth for his jaw.) You know, maybe his name really is J-O-H-N, but he changed it to J-O-N for show business. Well, you know, J-O-N is a lot zippier.
...so mind you, at this point I'm only going out with her two or three weeks. So she goes out of town and she asks me to feed her cat. So at this time, there's a lot of stuff going on in my life and, uh, it slips my mind for a few days. Maybe a week. Not a week, five, six days.
Yeah, right.
Wa.. He doesn't have to tell her.
You did?
You know, I think I could have played with dolls if their were dolls in the house. It seems like fun to me. It doesn't seem like a gender thing. I think I would like to play with dolls. What's so terrible?
Aw, that's a fun age. (Jerry looks at George distastefully.)
Oh, hi...
Every woman on the face of the earth has complete control of my life. And yet, I want them all.. is that irony?
My Job..arghhh
Hey. (pointing at him) Corbin Bernsen.
Yeah, hold on. I'm, uh, I'm just trying to get a reading on my dashboard compass. Where are my parents?
You know, sometimes those guys don't make it back. (Looks in fridge) I'm really hungry.
(Sulking) That's why I hate it.
Let me tell you who did, uh, buy it...um we pitched this story to Russell Dalrymple, the president of NBC, and he ate it up with a spoon.
I don't need any ideas. It's a show about nothing.
Really? I thought you and Celia were sleeping together?
Keep your head down.
Where's Kramer?
Were dying here!
Yes, she wants me to like her, if she likes me. But she doesnt like me!
I tried to be nice. I wasn't nice?
You haven't won. You may think you've won, but you haven't won. Do you know why? It's not over. This is not over. I'm not forgetting what's happening here. You have my ten dollars. I will get it back. Alright, don't worry. It's not over. I'm going now. Good bye. I will be back.
Shes right above you?
(ecstatic) What? You're moving to Florida!?! That's wonderful! I'm so happy! (pause) For you! I'm so happy for you! Oh, what do you need this cold weather for?
Catch what in time?
What do you mean?
Are you sure?
Sorry, Mr Wilhelm.
Hey.
Hey!
Really? They work here in the office?
If I didnt put that floss in my pocket, Id be crawling around her bedroom right now looking for my glasses.
Oh no no no. He's deeply in love, and I was just about to break up with her when she told me.
Oh, yes. I already packed up my desk, sir. I can be outta here in an hour.
They are?... Elaine?
I don't think so, Vic. I've done my homework. '89 Volvo, that's the car for me, it's the one I want.
What do you mean not goin'? Come on, we got plans here. Call her up.
Hey, is it my imagination, or do really good looking women walk a lot faster than everybody else?
Pasta primavera?
(we hear him think) My friends are idiots, she doesn't look like Jerry. She doesn't look like anybody. And so what if does look like Jerry,what does that mean?. That I could have everything I have with Jerry but because it's a woman I could also have sex with her....And that somehow that would be exactly what I always wanted.....She doesn't even look like Jerry..
She can't take it. It's not hers, it's theirs. Once there's no theirs there's no hers, it should be ours.
What is it about sex that just disrupts everything? Is it the touching? Is it the nudity?
Well, what was I supposed to do? Get out of the shower, put on my bathrobe? Go all the way down to the other end? Come all the way back?
(Walks off) I got a lot of thinking to do.
I'm not going back in there.
(shaking hands) I'm George.
Dad?!
I dont know how you put up with this.
Yeah, yeah. I've heard that. Meanwhile I'm here with you in a parking garage, what am I supposed to do?
Let me ask you this. If you stick your hand in the hair is it easy to get it out?
Yes, well, if you had never taken your keys back from Kramer, he never would have taken his back from you and given 'em to me, in which case I wouldn't have had to take mine back from her.
Yeah, and, ... Why won't this go down?
Okay. Now, why do I have to see (points) you?
She said looks aren't important to her?
Sorry. I'll just go back to my usual routine.
(Modest) Oh, thank you very much. (Chuckles)
This must be Sheila from the photo place.
This catalog is all about how to score in a foreign country.
Oh, my God, No, oh my God, . . . Jerry!
That's a shame. (Karen is shown singing off-key on the television.)
How could she leave us alone with this lunatic? Ten more minutes, and thats it! Im leaving. I have to tell you, this guy scares me.
So who am I to be thinking about someone's nose? I mean, I should be grateful someone like her even looks at me. I have no job, nothing. But I have to say, I think about the nose. I don't want to think about the nose. I don't ask to think about the nose, but I think about it. I go to bed at night, I tell myself, 'Don't think about the nose, forget the nose,' but I think about it. I look at her, I see nose.
I know. The only way to fix it now, is to get a whole new photo of Kruger.
Hey, is that Tim Whatley?
Let me ask you a question. This new move. Is there a knuckle involved in any way?
She's stickin' it to me that she makes more money than me.
Seriously, have they though about changing the setting?
(clearing his throat, he changes his order for Susan) Baked, uh, potato.
She called. He yelled Cartwright. I missed her.
WOULD YOU PICK A STATION!!!!!
Very good. Juicy.
Awright, lemme just say this. Ten thousand dollars, alright, and now I'm going below what you wanted to pay. You have your dinner, have your veal, or whatever it is. Enjoy...
How should I know?
Do you?
I told her that she was pretentious.
Well, Steven, I, uh.. (All the sudden, a small gang steps out of nowhere, surrounding George)
No. I like the ball! This is my One Chance to make a Great Entrance! My whole life! I have never made a great entrance!
What's goin'on?
I am. The folks are twelve hundred miles away. (gleeful) I'm basking in the buffer zone. (looks for the waitress) 'Nother piece of pie here!
Now everyone's going to think we're gay!
Really?
Well what did you want her to do, you left it on the night table.
Would you believe my luck? The first time in my life I have a good answer to the question, "What do you do?" and I have a girlfriend. I mean, you don't need a girlfriend when you can answer that question. That's what you say in order to get girlfriends. Once you can get a girlfriend, you don't want a girlfriend, you just want more girlfriends.
Say you, me, and Kramer are, uh, flying over the Andes.
What did they put on this tuna? Tastes like a dill, I think it's a dill.
What kind of noodle do you want?
So what do you care?
Yeah.
Him who? Hayman him.
Oh, Noooo, I'm so sorry. It's the MOOPS. The correct answer is, The MOOPS.
Ya gotta put on a show, ya always gotta give them a big show. You always have to be 'on' otherwise why would they like me? They'd just go for a better looking guy with more money.
No! Tell her.
You got the Yankee envelope?
What's with the dog?
Jerry! Hey, that's the guy!
Alleluia.
Now, you see, I don't get that. We had a relaxed stimulating, great conversation, she doesn't mention it? Why doesn't she mention it?
Where's the food? What happened to Ping?
No, never mind.
Oh, nothing.
I didn't get any bread.
No, I don't know who was doing that.
I had to say something. (chuckles) I had to say something. Everything was going so well. I had to say something.
You wha?
Simmer!
You, uh, wanted to see me, Mr. Steinbrenner?
You are aware that Pensky is interested in me.
You see, It's right here. It's all white...
Excuse me, uh, what are you doing in there?
By the way, how did Puddy get back in the picture?
All I want is my seventy-five cents back, an apology, and for him to be fired!
Thanks a lot. I'm really late. My parents are waiting in front of my building and we're stuck here.
No, no. Hes just being modest.
Wait a second. Think about it. He's not showing up. Wait till you see the line of cabs, its like forty-five minutes long. You said he's in Chicago.
Oh that's eh, that's a sandwich.
What, you're gonna pass up a wonderful opportunity to put that aloe pusher in her place?
Yes, I saw that.
Oh I'm a chucker.
...stop pushing. (to Elaine) Kramer spilled ammonia.
Take a guess.
Champagne?
Well, that's a given.
How hard could it be? You make a little contribution, you have a ceremony. I am going to think about this. I am really going to think about this.
What, are you crazy? It's a traumatic thing to be thrown up on.
Yeah, and now someone's going to be taking messages for me.
Why?
What?
They don't want to see me anymore!
There's porn.
Hey, use mine. Ill let you in.
(Nervous) Wh-what are you talking about? That - that's rediculous.
Ha ha ha ha, oh all right, go ahead, deride, deride if you must. But let me tell you something, with my personality and this set of hair, you know what I am now? I am in the game. I no longer defer to the coifed. I'm a player.
Grateful? How can you be grateful when you're *so* close to the end? When you know that any second-- Poof! Bamm-O! It can all be over. I mean you're not stupid, you can read the handwriting on the wall. It's a matter of simple arithmetic, for Gods sake...
'Why don't I rent the movie.' See, this is when I like you. Alright, now I'm relieved. (Kramer enters and comes over to the booth.)
What am I going to do now? I can't live without Susan. I gotta get her back. How? How, am I gonna get her back?
Maybe he didnt show up.
Yes, Im Sorry, it's a new coat. It-it's Gore-Tex.
All right, all right, one more time, one more time! What was the exact phrasing of the request?
Right.
Excuse me?
I can't run, I have a bad hamstring.
Yeah, much better. All right, so what's the move, because I need *something*. This woman I'm dating, it's like she's doing her nails during love-making.
(confused) What does that mean?
Hey, hey. Kramer, what are you doing? You can't smoke in here.
Elaines moving into your building?
Just give it a little more time.
What? Rate-aholics?
Well, I'm the boyfriend. Otherwise, what's the point of being the boyfriend? This is where you have to be when you're the boyfriend.
Lingerie?
Oh. Sorry.
Well, that doesn't mean anything!
You just checked your watch. Are you thinking of bailing on him?
Excuse me, I'm expecting a call. Costanza?
Huh?
What?
Yoohoo ,Plenty......Wh..wh..what are doing hum...you're going in?
Jerry Lewis?
Well, Tony.. took a bit of a tumble
In motion. The wheels are in motion.
So, the college cancelled the gig?
That's exactly what I said, except I used the word "momentum".
Well, I am just a T-bone kinda guy. Love that T-bone. In fact, you might as well call me--
Top priority.
(adamant) Ah, c'mon! I'm telling you, I can coach for the NFL. It's not that hard
Can he hear us?
Something like that.
Because she asked me to.
Where do you come up with this stuff?
Well, this I take to the grave.
Wait a minute Jerry, there's a bigger issue here. If you go through that wall and become one of those guys I'll be left here on this side. Take me with you.
You got isobutane-30?
(frustrated) Oh, look at this. There's no place to park around here. I don't even know why they sell cars in Manhattan.
What's that?
85!
(to Jerry) Huh-ho! Have you ever seen anything like this?
You remember my cousin Rhisa? I'm gonna date her.
You think you could hook me up with these guys?
Does she walk around holding a pen she never seems to need?
(bemused) Really?
Can I say one word to you? Lobster. The lobster here is unbelievable. (looks at the menu) Ooh, a little expensive.
I I just.. but..
Come on!
What's the difference? You know they way I work. I'm like a commercial jingle. First it's a little irritating, then you hear it a few times, youre hummin it in the shower, by the third date it's (sings) "By Mennen!".
So, she was switching? Back and forth?
Hey, how ya doing?!?
Good. Cause if this is a lie, if this is a joke, if this is your idea of some cute little game we're finished!
Oh, no, not just me, the whole organization. Especially Mr. Morgan.
(Somewhat stern) Oh, the thing's cancelled. Sit down.
He knows I'm waiting. He sees me. He just doesn't wanna look.
All right! We're here!
Thanks, Warden.
(coyly, he looks down and runs his finger along the top of the chair back in front of him) Do you, uh ... do you know what Im ... thinking about now?
You see, this is what I do with women. I start out too strong, now I have to become real, that's when it all falls apart. What good is real? They don't want real, they want funny.
That's exactly my point.
Wed all go to movie on Friday?
Whatever. (George looks to the table) Hey new tape recorder?
What?
Won't be a problem...(mumbles)
Kramer!! Kramer no!!
You know, you're going along, you think everything's all right and all of a sudden you get that tap. (George taps his own shoulder). You know it's like pfffff (whistling sound), all right that's enough, you're through.
(clipping on shades) Ha.. She'll have to find me first. (leaving)
Me, why?
That is so funny!
Hey, hey.
No No I'm working on a system...Who was that?
You know what? I can't do this. I can't read books anymore; books on tape have ruined me, Jerry. I need that nice voice. This book has *my* voice. I hate my voice.
Eh, I can't. I gotta go down to the foundation. I'm interviewing high schoolers for the Susan Ross.. scholarship.
And then, (Smacks the money) there were two.
Yes!
I can't carry a pen. I'm afraid I'll puncture my scrotum.
You're choking me.
Not necessarily. Mustard lends itself to the squeeze.
No, no, no. He just left.
No, what is it?
So what! Have a yoke! It won't kill you.
Alright, so, we need something..
You're *damn* right it's me.
Ade, you're a wonder. (he he -- george laughs)
Jerry, Jerry
All right, we'll be a little late, I,m not taking a cab.
Well, they gave birth to me, and, yada yada...
Right, I got news. You ready? (deep breath) Gary Fogel had cancer.
ALL the way, baby!
All right, let me ask you something When do you start to worry about ear hair?
So...?
Yeah, with crutches everyone has questions.
Well, go ahead, tell him.
Thinking? Nothing. What could I possibly be thinking?
Why even try anymore? There's no sense to it. I'm never gonna meet anybody, I should just accept it.
No, that's Jerry.
Apparently the glue in the wedding invitations was a....toxic.
I mean he's a good fighter and a nice guy but I don't like him.
Oh, I can't believe you're dropping out, too. So now Kramer and I have to pay for the entire gift?
Thank you.
Carol, thats so rude. Please, Im serious, just for a moment, if you wouldnt mind. And then well talk to Jerry.
You've been demoted.
(horrified) But that meeting starts in ten minutes!
You know, suddenly I'm in the mood for pasta primavera myself. (Jerry nudges George to sneak a peek at Molly's cleavage as she bends over and looks in her backpack. Jerry has a quick look, but George stares, hypnotized. Russell comes up behind George.)
Well, it comes and goes.
Do you know what happens if I miss him? I don't get credit for the pickup and I lose my 50 bucks...
What's with all these people having babies?
Wha? Did you use those? These are guest soaps! (he grabs the soaps and begins examining them for damage)
Jerry, I felt like a straight man in some horrible sketch. He was riffing! Riffing! On my pain!
Of course he is. There's got to be houses for rent in Tuscany. Do you know how big Tuscany is?
I got it. You wanna get her something nice? How 'bout a music box?
Ya know, I was just a little surprised.
Yeah, but nothing happens on the show. You see, it's just like life. You know, you eat, you go shopping, you read.. You eat, you read, You go shopping.
(putting the car in reverse) Oh beautiful! Look at that, the dream space right in front of Jerry's building. Huh? Dreams can come true, what did I tell you?
No. So, tonight she's got tickets for that show she's been working on. The Flying Sandos Brother.
So now you're doing my bits?
Yes, of course I'm taking Allison. This woman is genetically engineered to go to a ball. Tall, blonde, lithe--
Who, the Croat? [the tennis player]
(to the executives) Excuse me. Did you hire the Sunshine Carpet Cleaners?
That's funny. You're a funny guy.
(sad) Yeah! Yeah. Hey--hey you, you know.. Maybe I'll call you sometime.
Well perhaps, not to the extent that you are. But I know the basic plot. Yeah.
Tell her about the shoving.
Because he said I was going to.
There it is. Gate 46... We got plenty of time.
He's right! It's the same thing with the femenists. You know, they want everything to be equal, everything! But when the check comes, where are they?
(crying from the onion) You'll see I'm right.
It makes me look older.
Haven't you kissed her?
I wanna get it back when we were the Gatsbys.
Oh! you taped it?
Of course. Your massage. (winks) Enjoy your massage. (winks)
You were supposed to deliver my calzones. We had a deal!
Are you looking deep down at the real person underneath?
Right. I mean, we're on a subject. Why does it have to be changed?
Fortunately, yes.
Donna. Oh, youre the one that likes that commercial!
Oh, right. Oh no, man.
Yeah, I'm a great quitter. It's one of the few things I do well. I come form a long line of quitters. My father was a quitter, my grandfather was a quitter... I was raised to give up.
As you will see, the candy bar is paid for, and yet, remains dangling in the machine. (Notices that the Twix slot is completely empty) Hey, its gone. Where is my Twix? (Quickly looks around. His sights fall on the window of a door labeled "Employees Only". The same mechanic from before is eating a candy bar) What?! That guys eatin it!
(confessing) Well, actually, I thought it up on the way over here.
You're cuttin' me loose?
You think she thinks I have a beautiful face, or is she just saying that?
I'm not really sure, I...
He called in sick.
Big news?
I know. Don't you see. (emphatic) He was doing it to fool Lloyd Braun!
You came to see me. I work in the building.
(on intercom) It's George.
You know, it really can't.
Oh. Really.
Got her machine. Im dead, Im a dead man. Thats it. Im dead, Im a dead man. Dead man.
There's no Gammy.
Where's uh, where's Allison..
huh Kramer it's huh.. gonna be pretty dangerous up there
Oh, well I didn't know you went into Queens Jerry.
Well, he does.
I don't know. I don't wanna be one of those guys.
Yea I-I know about the cups.
So, did you get your new plates?
Listen, listen, dont get worked up, cause youre gonna know the whole story the minute she steps off the plane.
Oh, shhh.
Is it that obvious?
I believe you cut me off, and then made an obscene gesture.
Can I come upstairs, please? (Elaine pushes the button and lets George in.)
It'll be different this time.
Need to use the phone.
I'll drive.
I'm Cartwright!
Do we have to...?
Well I don't want to get into a big dispute about the pants.
(jubilant) Five thousand dollars? She doesnt have five thousand dollars!
Nah, I gotta deliver some Christmas presents to my parents.
(Quickly making it up) Well, possibly. I wrote an off-Broadway show, "La Cocina." ..Actually, it was off-off-Broadway. It was a comedy about a Mexican chef.
(playing it cool) I'm still here.
Do you hear that?
I think hitting a defenseless child is my business.
Oh, it was. But he claimed it was a 5th Avenue bar.
You know what? I should really go talk to her. Nothing confrontational. Just two adults sitting down trying to clear the air. You know, I just know if I could spend some time alone with her. I've got to. (he grabs his jacket) I've got to.
I don't like it, it's red. It it's too flashy.
Uh, railroads, uh...
Yeah. I had a great time.
No, no. No, no, no. (determined) We're staying on me. We haven't solved anything yet.
This is a cartoon!
Oh, my god.
(hangs up the phone) That's my toaster. I got to go. Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh!
Ehh. (nostalgic) Remember that summer at Dairy Queen where I cooled my feet in the soft-serve machine?
(yelling) Awright, let's just stay calm here! Don't get all crazy on me!
I thought I saw him look in the mirror suspiciously.
Im not going with him. I dont even know the guy. (to the teller) Look, they did this for me before.
I say fourteen o nine (1409).
Right
Siena, I love you.
Oh, no, no--
It's a joke.
Tell you what, I'll make a deal with you. I'll sell it to you right now for ten bucks.
Ok. Good. And Kramer, you're in charge of taping off the loading zone.
Maybe I could call my father.
Well, what's the reason?
"No!...not...nothing."
Nice.
Alright, still her father didn't have to throw me out like that, he could have just asked me to leave. The guy had me in a headlock! Susan's not going tonight you know.
YES! It Blows Up! If you knew that, what did you tell Elaine for?
A man carries a wallet.
So? What'm I gonna do?
A signal, right, um, okay, uh, okay, the signal is, Ill call out tippy-toe!
No. Rice and caramel.
Well, you know... the friend meeting the new woman. I feel like I'm getting fixed up for a friendship.
So I spoke a little to your little friend Denise last night.
Oh, this is good. This Kruger guy is clueless. I can't wait to work for him.
When Lupe makes up the beds in the morning.
Ade, ahh, ahh, ah ... Im giving you a raise!
I know that's why I bought `em but they're not comfortable.
So, what, no lunch?
The old man got to me.
I, uh, oh, broke a shoelace today.
Probably because this whole Universe is against me!
Is that the guy who likes fat women?
He didn't say he can't.
What clothes?
No.
Oh yeah, real cool. You're a cool guy.
Great. Seven-thirty, alright?
Payroll? No, no, I haven't done that.
Take the suit.
Are you supposed to yell it?
No details?
Oh.
(Interrupting) Anyway, I just wanted to let you know I'm really sorry that happened, and if I can help out in any way, I'll certainly be glad to do that. (Pause) Well, I guess that's about it.
You took me to one of your shows..
(hesitatingly) ... no...
My code?
What kind of a greeting was that?
No, I was just wondering... if you guys, uh, had any gum.
Well, I'm also an architect. Is that pastrami?
Oh! my god. Oh! man...
Oh yes, of course, and we have to be fair. (placing the suit further away in the rack)
What does that do?
(After looking in the bag) The pea pods? All you saved was the pea pods? (Kramer enters)
Oh.
Yeah, good, good.
She said "sweep together" you idiots, not "sleep together."
(Yelling out) It's my apartment, Eldridge! The Stalkholm may not have sunk ya, but I will! Ha, ha, ha!
Alright, look, you want to be in?
Well, she doesn't really want to see Firestorm.
No. Lunch we read, dinner we read.
We have a, three-o'clock appointments.
Atlantic City? (thinks) Yes! Yes! I will go to Atlantic City. I'm in. I'm down.
Now, because of that stupid rye bread, I gotta keep them all separated for the rest of my life.
No! I am not going to see a psychiatrist!
He poked me!
Yeah.
And the amazing thing is she eats like there's no tomorra'. I mean I've never seen an appetite like this. Desserts. Everything. I don't know how she does it.
Why don't you just ask Jeffrey?
(takes a large bite - with his mouth still full, his speech is muffled) Oh, this is fabulous.
Well, giddy-up!
(Yelling out, frustrated. The camera spins from a top angle) Twwwwiiiiiixxxxx!
No Don't get the camera , we don't need the camera. Listen I know your skeptical , but I really believe in the Chinese.
In six games.
Okay.
Kramer goes to a fantasy camp. His whole life is a fantasy camp. People should plunk down two-thousand dollars to live like him for a week. Do nothing, fall ass-backwards into money, mooch food off your neighbors and have sex without dating; that's a fantasy camp.
"Yeah,yeah yeah yeah! I've seen these.....they sorta ..they make your legs..stronger."
Listen. Let me ask you something. If you and Mona were ever to... dance, how do you decide who leads? I mean... do you take turns? Do you discuss it beforehand? How does that work?
Black and white?
Did you see the way she pointed at the check? She gave me the finger.
"Jimmy, right."
Yeah! like the big toe is like the captain of the toes, but sometimes the toe next to the big toe gets so big that there's like a power struggle and the second toe assumes control of the foot.
Yeah, you gotta watch for the jellyfish.
Nothing.
Jerry, it's me, George, don't worry, I'll return it
He can be pedantic. He can be pedantic.
So what?
Well I didn't know you wanted to go to the flea market.
I haven't even met the fiancee! Whatever! (Leaves for washroom)
Yeah.( reaches for the purse and finds a piece of paper . he looks annoyed.
Why would we want to help somebody?
No! Jerry!
Coffees coffee in the morning. Its not coffee at twelve oclock at night.
What about the Coast Guard? Seems like a lot of pride there, a lot of tradition.
Oh ya, This is my fiance, Susan. This is David
Ah, excuse me, Vice-president Coco, no one cares about your Gammy.
Yeah. (Points to two open seats in front of Jerry's. To Nina) Sit down there. (Sees Jerry in the crowd) Hello, Jerry. (Obviously angered at Jerry) I believe you know Nina.
Have you ever had their egg salad?
(Getting up) Alright, Ma, that's enough!
My favorite.
(stands up) I am.
Gotta get the good ones.
Yeah, take it easy.
Oh, you're dead.
Oh, come on, it's five minutes.
Well, if I could talk to the mothers and have sex with the daughters, then I'd really have something goin'.
Me? No, no, I don't, I don't. Doing very well, very well, yep.
I can't go out there, he knows we're friends.
She might not be comfortable.
What about that spot I got?
Exactly.
I gotta go back to the library and talk to him. I gotta find out if I&Mac226;m the guy who ruined his life.
(Places the doll presumingly where it belongs on a shelf) Ya?
Everybody's doing something, we'll do nothing.
Oh, no no no, I haven't even seen her apartment yet. Tomorrow night's the first night.
All right, Puddy, listen, and listen good I need to know the name of that mechanic that walks around here. Big guy, a liar. Short name. Sam? Moe? Sol?!
I think I may be in love with this woman.
I did it. Hunh, we're going out as soon as she gets off of work and it'll still be daytime. You know I, Im much better in the daytime then I am at night. it's less pressure.
Hey.
Don't you see what this says? How can you possibly like somebody ,if you think they look like this?
I can't have any parties while they're out of town. (he leaves to return the soaps)
Morning Thunder has caffeine in it, Jerry doesn't drink caffeine.
Who's Grossbard?
Oh the ego on you.
Oh. That's good.
No problem there. Conformity is an obsession with me.
Yes and I was hoping ... to get a thirteen week extension.
Clearer
(Starting to panic again) What? Oh my God. What? Is it meningitis? Scoliosis? Lupis?! Is it Lupis?!
I got engaged. I'm getting married. I asked Susan to marry me. We're getting married this Christmas.
Yeah, conjugal visit sex. That is happening!
What quit? (laughing) Who quit?
Eh, listen Mr. Kruger, I got a message from Dr. Van Nostrand and he says it might be wise to you to see another doctor about that mole.
Well, I'm sure at some point between the years 800 and 1200--somewhere--there were two women living together.
I hate this mall, there are never any spaces here...
Yeah, look at me. Now I GOTTA FIGURE OUT THE HAT SIZES OF 59,000 DIFFERENT PEOPLE!! WHAT IF A PINHEAD SHOWS UP. I GOTTA BE ON TOP OF THAT.
Ah, excuse me. Do you have, uh, change of a dollar?
Where's the sunblock?
What for?
(hopeful) So, details?
Yeah, don't worry. He can afford it.
Well if Houdini couldn't do it, what chance do I have?
I am staying out all night!
(Mutters) No, it's not.
I must have dripped some on the floor and I slipped and...
Tarragon? Oh, you're crazy.
Oh, *please*! Me? C'mon! That's *great*! Are you kidding? I think thats fan*tastic*! I've always encouraged experimentation! I'm the first guy in the pool! Who do you think you're talking to?
Yeah, you know we spoke for a little bit...
You know they used to make leisure suits out of this fabric?
Velvet...
I'm not* sure.
Wow! I didn't try that 'til I was 23.
Yeah. I'll pay for it.
Hey oh.
Yeah.. may - maybe I'll meet ya?
You tell Russell.
You don't know where we parked?
So you're talking...
Hm. Thanks.
The outlet?
I was throwing up all night. It was like my own personal Crying Game.
Yeah, well...a little rough finding something good in your price-range. (to Jerry) But you, my friend, may be in luck.
Is there a pinkish hue?
And you're the shark?
Especially her. She does not like disappointment. Well, I have to do it. I can't make December. There's no way I can make December. Right? I mean, you can see that, right? I mean, look at me. Look. Look. Can I make December? I can't make December. Right? Look. Look.
She told me she wants-- (Pauses until a woman coming down the stairs passes) She told me she wants me to make love to her.
Oh, hello Professor.
What, you don't want to be you?
What are we gonna tell Jerry about the car?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. But then, I said to him, 'Oh yeah? Well, the jerk store called, and they're running outta you.'
Sorry, the players will be reimbursed?
No come on, let me, let me. I smashed your car, it cost you over two thousand dollars,
Have you ever given your code to anyone?
I might tell her that I love her. I came this close last night, then I just chickened out.
(pointedly) Oh, I'm sorry, I require twenty-four hours notice for a cancellation. Now, as I see it, you owe me seventy-five dollars.
You know, .. blah ...
A ha! We're just friends.
"Cold showers? They're for psychotics."
I found it morose. Why dwell on these negative themes?
Help, someone. (BUBBLE BOY is strangling George)
Why not. I would be.
Oh, wow.
I take an eye test; I flunk it, the next thing you know I am swinging to the sweet sounds of risk management.
Yeah, Susan tell him.
But you have a watch on.
Why does he have to stand?
No you weren't. Stop there, that's fine.
Are you sure?
Goldfish.
I've done the march in. Best feeling in the world.
Alright, you having a good time there?
Love to.
Quick. Get this thing back in the pizzeria
Five' eight! Five' seven!
I broke up with her.
What?
(thoughtful) Downtown.
Hey.
Was that wrong? Should I have not done that? I tell you I gotta plead ignorance on this thing because if anyone had said anything to me at all when I first started here that that sort of thing was frouned upon, you know, cause I've worked in a lot of offices and I tell you peope do that all the time.
Timberlands. (Showing Elaine his boots)
I got greedy. Flew too close to the sun on wings of pastrami.
(While skimming a Monk's menu) You know, I didn't go to the bathroom the entire time we were in India.
Really?
Blimp The Hindenburg Story.
Dinner? (grabs Kramer)
Oh please.
Joe DiMaggio.
"BECAUSE IF HE CAN'T JUMP. THERE GOES MY SNEAKER BUSINESS!!"
What?
You didn't?
No, really. No, no, thanks.
Well, I - I could, Uh, I could give the money back. Here. (Holds it out)
Yeah. Once belonged to Jon Voight.
Mmm-mm.
Yes.
'Cause Neil Watkins from accounting is T-bone!
All right, all right, two fifty.
No!
I just wanted to tell you that I really enjoyed Fair Game. I thought it was just brilliant.
No, wait!
What do the Chinese have to gain by faking a cure for baldness?
Frolf, frisbee golf Jerry. Golf with a frisbee. This is gonna be my time. Time to taste the fruits and let the juices drip down my chin. I proclaim this The Summer of George!
Hey Elaine. (George hangs up his raincoat next to the door) Im telling you Jerry, having a secretary is incredible. (George claps hands) I don't know why I didnt have one before.
Yeah. I love Hampton tomatoes. You know, you can eat 'em like apples. You know it's funny, the tomato never really took on as a hand fruit.
I mean I'm the one who bought it.
No. She tried to give me the "it's not you, it's me" routine.
Yeah.
And that was wrong, Jerry! You simple must to apologize..
(hanging up) All right, Jerry. I'll do it. See ya.
I guess so.
That, or Whos bra is this?
What kind of a shake does he have?
What? I'm not eating bread now. I'm off bread.
I can do this, Jerry.
A plane crash? A Heart attack? Lupus? Is it Lupus?
Cancer? Is it cancer? Do I have cancer?
You know, we could go uptown, and that way we could give Jerry a ride home.
Did you ever see her lose her temper. I was once late cause I bought a Panama hat -- she grabbed it by the brim, pulled it down so hard my head came right through the top of it.
Yeah. Cotton breathes, you see, it's much softer. Imagine playing games and your team is five degrees cooler than the other team. Don't you think that would be an advantage? They're cooler, they're more comfortable...they're happier - they're gonna play better.
So we had a good time... the four of us.
"Jerry"!
Your hose! Where's your hose?!
Of course. So, Im looking at it. I look up, I see shes looking at it. Our eyes lock. It was a horrible moment. I just..
Hello.(with not a big smile)
(to Claire) Now, a woman calls me, all right?
Now?
Come on. Ya wanna go get some lunch?
Thirteen thousand?
Yes, and I'm speaking at a men's' conference.
Get out?
Keith Hernandez? The baseball player?
This is nighmare. Kramer how long was I on?
Well where is she?
Its an incredible deal. I dont know why you dont come with me.
They're shooting! They're shooting!
That's insulting! Ted Danson makes eight hundred thousand dollars an episode.
Please. They dont do anything. Look, do I have to break up with her in person? Cant I do it over the phone? I-I have no stomach for these things.
I don't have my ATM card.
I stopped having sex.
Any, uh.. progress, there? What's the latest?
Well, I could be a little sweetie tweetie weetie weetie.
(Acting innocent) I'm all set.
One of the guys in my cell threw a piece of gum at him.
Will you stop it?
So what?! She still gave you advice; what's the difference if she's not Chinese?!?!
Someday, before I die, mark my words - I'm gonna tell that woman exactly what I think of her. I'll never be able to forgive myself until I do.
Oh, my God...
You coulda damaged my hand!
"Hey listen, let me give you my card. It's got my home number on it. I want to buy the first pair when the next shipment comes in."
Well, sorry I missed that, uh, charity thing. But this was one of those truly glorious Hampton weekends that you always hear about.
That's a very good question. You know she and I go out for dinner, she doesn't even reach for the check. That?s all I?m asking for is a reach. Is that so much to ask for?
Yes! Yes, I'm the one! Hey! So, you know Jon Voight!
Uh, we're cool. Everything's cool (to security attendent)
Alright, that's enough.
The Duty Free Shop? Duty Free is the biggest sucker deal in retail. Do you know how much duty is?
Newspaper.
(suspicious) You didn't say hello?
Oh well, I hope he doesn't jum...
Yeah. There's something wrong with that? I'm a character. People are always saying to me, "You know you're a quite a character."
Oh with all due respect, I went there too, and I work for a team that just won the World Series.
(standing up) I'm just gonna go to the bathroom.
He still wins but it's not a blowout.
Alright, you're in for one-fifty.
Can you do it?
No, no, no we'll talk about it later.
Karen.
What actress does she remind you of?
Fine.
Would you get out of here. Who's gonna turn down a chair? I would be very interested to know how he felt about all of this. Maybe I'll have a talk with him.
C'mon, c'mon...(stands up and physically rolls Betsy to the left side of the couch.) See, now, is that so bad?
I don't wanna tell you how to run your show.
I'm telling you, that cashier is riding horses on my money.
I mentioned how I liked horse manure.
The pig-man can take the bus.
The next morning, I woke up, and it was going like this. (moves his arm slowly) I can control it if I really concentrate. But otherwise, (arm moves) oh.
Who paid?
Since when is Elaine's boyfriend selling cars? I thought he was a mechanic.
Let's have it.
(Expressing shock) Woah. Whoa! Woah!
What?
So what? Ill start talking to him, you know, casual, and Ill work my way around to it.
We're in Turkey?
Yes. Well -- So, uh, sit on the same side at a booth, huh?
The door? Why would I go out the door? The window's right here.
Look it's no secret what's going on between us. (to Jerry) She doesn't like me. Now Jerry if you don't mind.
They'll make you a Big Salad. What do you think, they're the only one's that make a Big Salad?
What if it felt good?
(knocks) You hem... wanted to see me Mr. Steinbrenner?"
What, you don't like the name?
This is nice.
Elaine, bald men, with no jobs, and no money, who live with their parents, don't approach strange women.
Maybe!.. And I'm moving back in there!
Wait, wait, did you ever see him throw up?!
Yeah, two for the 715 of Novaj pravas (?). What you're wearing the green sweater?
It's this way... AND THEY TAKE OFF AGAIN, PAIRING OFF
No problem.
I bought a new recliner with a fridge build right in to it.
Are you kidding? People get spaces this good, they never give em up.
Well bear in mind that I am in the smaller office.
You're fresh (grabs her arm) You're very fresh. You seem very fresh to me. You're very vital. I couldn't take you any fresher.
Okay. Uh, my mother is is going to pay for the sessions. ... Oh,Elaine?
Hi. I-I really should be getting back to my fianc, you know, we, uh, we had this big fight yesterday and, uh, well she, she wants to-to know my secret code. I-I don't know, I can't tell her. The funny thing is, you know, I would really love to tell someone 'cause it's killing me. You uh, you wanna know what it is? It's Bosco. You know, the chocolate syrup? I love that stuff, I pour it in milk, it's my favorite drink. Hoo-hoo, boy, that is a relief!
Heuh. huh. Stick around a while.
How much do you tip a chamber maid?
A little notice would've helped! How many people?
How would you find out something like that...wait a minute, what am I thinking? I've got the entire Yankee organization at my disposal.
Oh, it's gotta be fifty! Hee hee! You know how much Ted Danson makes, huh?
No. No it's not. You don't know this guy. It woulda been so sweet.
With Candace Bergen!
Exactly, you know what I'm talking about, right?
Well I know how to drive.
No problem here.
Of course not. You don't care what I look like.
(depressed) Feel like I can't do anything wrong.
It's about nothing.
What were you doing?
(Laughs) You, I guess, you don't remember me.. but we actually, kind of um.. went out.. a couple of years ago.. once.. remember?
It's just a magnificent stone. (turns to Jerry) Jerry?
What, wha, what're you talkin' about?
So you're Jason Hanke's supervisor?
Who's dressing you? (Laughs) You look like a complete idiot! You know, I wouldn't wipe my- (Unable to take anymore, Leslie gets up and shoves George violently. His hands go straight for the hot iron sitting on the dressing room table. George screams out in agony) AAHHHH!!!!! (his voice is heard outside the building, on the street, and in the park were a bunch of pigeons are scared by the yelling)
Hey Elaine? Put me down for some of that art. 1,900 dollars worth.
Oh, nothing happened, but it was...
You want to hear more? The master bedroom opens into the solarium.
I know, I know, I can't stop it!
(MUMBLING) You come to a parking lot, you write it down. How hard is that?
You gonna sleep on the fold-out?
Elaine, get something! Its all taken care of.
What's the difference?
Jiffy Park. It's incredible.. Seventy-five dollars a month.
(amused) You're supposed to do that?
It was Moops.
Did you dressed nice, did you do it classy?
Oh, the busboy left the menu a little close to the candle.
Yes of course go ahead. My guess is you're going to like this very much.
The Bubble Boy!
No. It didn't take.
[quietly] C'mon, go along...
I have to rewind it first. (George presses the rewind button on the tape recorder. He and Jerry stand there, waiting impatiently as it rewinds.) Alright, alright.
We came in over there!
Jerry! I need you to get another picture of man-hands. I'm beggin' you!
Sure.
I-I-I can't find my glasses.
Oh yeah. My friend lived there.
Whoa, whoa, you're not getting in my car with gummy shoes.
I don't even know Peterman. How the hell am I gonna relax? I'm gonna have to be on all night. I don't like being on, Jerry, I would much rather be off.
And she slaves to earn every penny. So that someday, I might be able to walk up to a woman and say, "Yes, I'm bald, but I'm still a good person."
I will never understand the bathrooms in this country. Why is it that the doors on the stalls do not come all the way down to the floor?
I guess she did. He's gone, now I'm the man.
Uh, twice what youre payin here, but its a great building. Its two bedrooms!
Ma, your eyes!
I tought I saw a face.
Super Savers? Are they refundable!?
Never expected this did you?
How's your life? All right?
No not really.
I'm not paying $500 for this! It's a piece of junk!
All right, all right.
We'll ask him. (opens partition) My dear fellow, where are you dropping us?
Hey.
(he walks casually to Tom, and taps his arm) Listen. I know we've had our problems in the past, but we got a show to do tonight. Time to pull together as a team. Life's too short. I say, let's let bygones be bygones. If you took the raisins, if you didn't take the raisins-- They weren't even my raisins. I was just curious because it seems like a strange to do to walk into a room, audition, and to walk out with a box of raisins. Anyway, whatever. If you ever want to tell me about it, the door to my office is always opened. In the event that I get an office. You'll come in, we'll talk about the raisins. We'll have a nice laugh.
Oh my God! (coming out of bathroom) You know what I just realized?! If they get divorced an' live in two separate places? That's twice as many visits!
I can't believe you're hoarding sex moves. I'm out there rubbing two sticks together. You walk around with a zippo.
It's not really a mental institution. It's more like a depression clinic. She went out to Woodhaven and checked herself in. I'm, I'm sick over this.
ah.
I didn't shave this morning. I don't feel like myself.
If anybody should be getting more it's you.
Fourteen. (shouting after Ken) Fourteen!
What do you mean you didn't think I wasn't gonna use them?!
Who do you like?
There he is. Right on time as usual.
I got to go.
Moisturizer?
Hey, grown-up. (they both chuckle, George notices Gwen enter the room) Oh my god, there she is. Go ahead, go ahead. (to the others) Let's go, let's go. All right what are they saying?
A guy?
Narks?
(Laughs slightly) A physician married to a salesman. (Chuckles) Well, I gotta tell you, Beth, you coulda done a lot better than him.
I believe that I am about to become the target of a systematic process of intimidation and manipulation, the likes of which you have never -
(smiling) Uh, hi. Uhm, remember me? I..I'm the guy who looks like Neil?
Kramer, can we do this later..
Ahhh. How does this thing work?
How are you closer to him than me?
Unsettling?
It's George
I'll tell you what that is - that's a violation of club rules. Now I got him! And you're my witness!
(Anyway,) on the left--exquisite marble! High ceilings. An' a flush, like a jet engine! (imitates sound) Ha ha!
(to Jerry, sarcastically) Yeah, doctor. Im going to have to wait in that little room all by myself, arent I? (He picks up a crossword puzzle.) I better take this. I hate the little room. (George walks into the hallway that leads to the doctors office.) Oh, hello, Doctor.
Enjoy, enjoy.
Thanks Roy.
The sea was angry that day my friends like an old man trying to send back soup in a deli!
Alright, but I'm serious about this.
Really? You wanna come?
Ya, sure sure.
Ya.
What do we have in the fruit department?
Those were her exact words, I like George.
(internally) How am I gonna get out of this? Think Costanza, think!
A lot of people say it.
On-the-street cell-phone call is the lowest phone call you can make.
Tell me about the free facial.
Why am I a marine biologist?
Let me see that. (Studies the note)
Squirrel? Well, we have no deal with THEM!
(Defensively) He knows how to read. And he also knows finishing an entire book doesn't prove anything. And get this he's into architecture.
Well no not yet, you gotta buy french stamps (pauses) I-I'll reimburse you of course.
I don't know. A little thing called Step Nine? Instead of an apology, he was beboppin' and scattin' all over me.
(considers, but got into elevator) Won't work.
Nothing.
So, uh are you sleeping with Peterman?
They, uh... said you were with some guy who was wearing a cape?...
Tell you about the Portuguese waitress.
The locker room!
(Interrupts) And I still say hes naked under there!
Where was pesto 10 years ago?
It's like a magic trick. Sometimes I think it would be easier to bend a spoon mentally than to make that transformation.
Five-hundred dollars?! What?
Hey, buddies.
(still looking at that picture) You know if I told my engagement story to that receptionist, but told her this, was my fiance..
Jerry, could you excuse us for a few minutes, please?
Yes! Yes. You know. She didn't know about Pasteurization. He didn't know anout Fumigation. But they made it work!
Where? (He looks out window and gets hit by a tomato)
Yes it is. She just took credit for my salad. That's not right.
I don't have a job!
It's beautiful. She makes all the plans. I'm not from around here so it's okay if I'm stupid, and she knows I'm only in town visiting so there's no messy breakup
No no, this is a matter of principle. That would just be saying that anybody could just pull into any parking space any way they want. Well I'm making a stand here. I'm saying *no* to head first parking. I'm not putting up with that. We put up with too much crap in this city, we're not putting up with head first parking.
What is with this damn zipper?
Well what would I say in the note?
Go back?
Reilly is no longer with the club. (getting up) You believe that?
Oh, Rita. Hey, Mr. Shermack, how're you doing, good to see you. Jay, always a pleasure. (To Susan) Sweetie. (Kisses her and then sits down next to Jerry) Yeah, yeah, that butler idea, that's beautiful. Isn't that killer? (Aside to Jerry) I thought I was getting the butler.
Yeah, okey, wait wait. That will separate.
We just came from Chadway's(?) What's going on.
Oh, thank you.
(trying again with Glenda) I'm gonna count to three. If you don't give up the chair, the wig is coming off.
I'm gonna go with you. I gotta get a new suit. I got a second interview with MacKenzie, and I think I'm really close. They're all taking me out to lunch on Friday.
No, I-I-I-I'm good. Really.
(out the window) Keith, Keith, up here. Can you do me a favor? I need you to go to the unemployment office with me. I, I'm Jerry's friend  the guy from the locker room,  I'm the chucker. It'll take five minutes. Wait. Wait.
Nothing at all.
I'm making it up.
(annoyed) Hes an importer/exporter, okay? (beat) Elaine ever call you back?
Warning signs?
What are you doing? You're making more than I am. A secretary cannot make more than her boss.
I havent seen it yet, but its a two-bedroom, its on the uh, west 83rd, bout a half block from the park?
All right there you go. It's a '47 cabin all right. So, we'll see you tomorrow.
Well, if it doesn't concern me, then I can stay. (Kramer grabs the back of George's chair, drags him out into the hallway and closes the door.)
Ha.
They were drinking champaign in a buggy!
Im not?
I'm a bootlegger.
(Leaving) I'll store these over at Kramer's apartment.
Sid, who's gonna move the cars while you're away?
and JERRY Very nice, very nice, nice.
Medium turkey chili.
Hey.
Oh Oh, here, lemme uh...
Hey. You ready?
Shake his hand?
Why didn't she tell us?
What about all the loser stuff?
Mrs. Seinfeld?!?
You should've seen her face. It was the exact same look my father gave me when I told him I wanted to be a ventriloquist.
Start looking for a job.
(smiling) So, you know, what, what happened?
What?
Hi.
What, was that not politically correct? It's a legitimate question.
Because I'm REFRESHED. I finally found a way to sleep in my office. Under the desk. I lie on my back. I tuck in the chair. I'm invisible.
Svenjolly. (licking a little bit of peanut butter from his finger)
(Arms out) I am king of the county. You?
You're very good. Very good with the moanings and the gyrations. Y-You really had me going there for a minute.
Well, I guess these would be out of the question. (pulls out two pudding skins in plastic bags.)
So what happened? She throw you out? Eh?
Algae, obviously plankton, hmhm. I don't know what else I could tell ya, ah, Oh I-I just got back from a trip to the Galapagos Islands, I was living with the turtles.
... She's got it stashed away in there somewhere.
Watch me.
Because I'm a cheater! I had to tell you.
You went home with him?
Really? I thought you liked her.
Anyway.
Slippery Pete?
Why'd you pick Hoover? Was he that interesting to talk to?
She knows that I have her clock. I know that she has my hat. I think she's getting ready to make an exchange.
No, don't say a word. If she thinks my friends are jerks, then I'm a *jerk*...
Did you see that? The guy's walking away. What is wrong with you? That was a three hundred dollar profit.
Because. There was a lot of cake lying around the house. Just sitting there going with all the excess milk from all the experiments [grins]
I cant stand doing laundry. Thats why I have forty pairs of underwear.
Elaine could be a character. Kramer..
No, that's not enough BTUs for my living room...That was a complete waste of time.
Quick, what's your favorite animal?
He said he didn't care. Oh, God I love that place. Hey, have you seen other dermatologist?
I meet this women, Sheila. She works down at the one hour photo pace. She's got this incredible smile. Like she's got extra teeth or something
We'll take it!
Oh, I sure hope so.
Signal? What signal?
No, but um I have very good report with women, very good, comfortable. And from the first time I laid eyes on a brassieres, I was enthralled.
So concerned was he, that word of his poor tennis skills might leak out, he chose to offer you his wife as some sort of mediaeval sexual payola?
(TO JERRY, SOMEWHAT IMPRESSED) A Red Chinese prison?
What are all sweatin' for?
No catchin.
Hi ah, My name is George.
What did he give you for it.
Look, I am under direct orders from Mr Wilhelm. So if you have a problem with that, maybe you should just take it up with him.
Oh, I think that's fantastic. Good for you. Nice. That's very nice.
Yes! Nothing says George like a movie!
(Trying to be modest) Ah, come on..
Sperry Rand Building. 14th floor, Morgan Apparel. Mention my name - she'll give you the key.
C'mon, you took my seat.
Peggy! (they all sit) His daughter Peggy. Peggy's coming over to serve.
It may have moved, I don't know.
"HEY! JIMMY!!! ha ha ha........Great game."
Yeaah, beautiful... (They try to hit a high five, but George hits Elaine in the forehead.) Sorry...
He can't not be funny.
It'll have to be a night job anyway. You don't normally work after dinner, do you?
You've still got pretty good coverage. Once the enemy advances beyond this perimeter - (points at Kurt's head with a pen) - then you won't be Kurt anymore.
People always leave old things in their medicine cabinet.
Heh, Mercury head. You mind?
What does it look like Im doing?
(forced buoyancy) Hey, you know, let's call Susan, we'll go have coffee.
Nowhere.
Well, you know, I gotta go to, uh, Susan's parent's house for dinner.. and, you know, I want to shower first.. and I want to leave myself plenty of time.
You know what I've come to realize? I'm not just bored. I genuinely dislike her.
It's not that easy. It's like "Beat The Clock," there's a lot of pressure there.
Well, sometimes you can't help these people 'til they hit rock bottom.
All right, it wouldn't kill me.
Look, you wanna have sex right now? Do want to have sex with me right now? Let's go! C'mon, let's go baby! C'mon!
What the Hell is a "Polar Bear"?
You know a lost and found could be a good idea.
My father wears his sneakers in the pool! Sneakers!
Soooooo
Excuse me, darling, do I detect a Portuguese accent?
No, no,
(Still with a tone) He is. You dont know what Im doin here.
Because of me? You must be joking! Who wouldn't want to live because of me? I'm nothing!
Oh uuh, sure, why not. (the blind man hangs on to George's arm) Hey, that's the guy.
Very nice Tom, that was terrific.
The Lowers, really?
No, no, no, no, Im It. I win.
Why did you even take it? You broke up with her!
I'll tell you something, if I'd own a company, my employees would love me. They'd have huge pictures of me up on the walls and in their home, like Lenin.
Its been a long night. You go home and get some sleep.
(Identifying what Jerry said) Clint Eastwood!
All right, no more lies. Elaine is been chosen to represent the Upper West Side in the next Biosphere project.
What about me?
Please, it's not necessary.
You don't understand, there's a *blurb* about me in this magazine!
Because important things go in a case. You got a skull for your brain, a plastic sleeve for your comb, and a wallet for your money.
No.
I cant call her now. Its too soon. Im planning a Wednesday call.
That's a little steep don't you think?
You're selling computers?
Oh, come on. What, are you kidding? GEORGE I'm much more comfortable criticizing people behind there backs. Anyway, look who's talking. You just broke up with with Melanie last week because she "shuushed you" while you were watching TV.
She stole twenty dollars from me. (getting angry) Yeah, I might've gotten it back, but Lloyd Braun interfered!
Things are good.
Or, I could take the twenty, then I could pay *you* later.
But my friend here has hypothermia.
Exactly. (Sees an off-camera co-worker) Erica!
Ah, I've had everything on the menu. Uh, surprise me.
I'd like to say it once to someone that can actually hear it!
Right, gotta get going.
Yeah, I do that too. I feel guilty about getting the pleasure. I feel like I don't deserve it so I talk. It stops me from enjoying it. There's nothing to eat in here.
Regardless. I had to walk around for the rest of the party in some cheap Metlife windbreaker. Now, it is payback time.
Embezzlement.
Jerry, let's go! You ready?
(smiling) Ho ho. Funny. Isn't he funny? Funny guy. Ha ha ha.
They should call it round tine. You know what I'm talking about.
She doesn't want to get a bra.
(Vowing) Well, I'll tell you this, though - I am never doing.. that , again.
It's an expression.
No, I don't have any change.
They don't need any water, so you don't have to keep taking them to the bathroom.
Well it's not my fault. Seinfeld can't drive. How hard is it to follow somebody?
Elaine.
When you're playing the piano do you think about me?
Hennigans. I was there sitting in the office and the cleaning woman comes in. I've always been attracted to cleaning women. Cleaning women, chambermaids.
Jerry, what do you, you wanna, you wanna see the place or not?
Okay. A little.
Oh yes I am Father. Incredibly sincere. So, uh, pffft, am I in?
Ho, ho, ho! Hes got a live one. Hes just reeling his big fish in!
Jerry, I'm not suggesting getting rid of the girl. She's integral.
The contest - I cheated.
Well, let's just say it wouldn't exist without me. (Notices another person in the library dressed the same as Celia.) So you two uh, shop at the same store, (hu)?
No, no, the machine'll get it...
The perfect combination of Mountain Dew and mozzarella...just the right amount of grease on the joy stick...
Wednesday? That's your personal business?! (stalks over to the counter) Skiing?! (angry) So let people suffer, while you're shushing all over a mountain?
The Day..
This is incredible!
What's she like? Impressive?
Wha, where is he going?
[realizing the only way out is to show the stub] I've got the stub.
Jerry?
Ho, ho, ho, good dog, good dog...
I know....
What the hell happened?
I was just in there. Its embarrassing.
(leaving to the bedroom) I gave it to Cosmo.
And... and anybody can do this?
I always get myself in this position. Can't be on time. Gotta rush.
Excuse me, do you have a ticket?
Lemme see this. (Tries to grab the papers.)
She put them in her pocket book. She probably took them out there with her.
Oh, no. No no no no.
huh you tell her
That woman was unequivocally the worst date of my life.
Oh, Safire. Uh ha
You could eat of that shotgun.
(Turning back to Jerry, he takes the check back. He just now notices the shirt Jerry's wearing, and snickers, pointing) Nice shirt.. (Laughs, Jerry shrugs) What is this? Is this what you wore on the show?
So now, the father is screaming at me, he's demanding that I pay for the boom box. Finally, I gave them a fake address and got the hell out of there.
Between the car getting totalled, the towing charge and the fine, there's no way I can ever pay him back...
How can you compare you parents to my parents?!
He didn't say anything.
The prop comic? (Ronnie holds up his water gun and smiles.) Oh, hi...I didn't recognize you, what...did you get a haircut?
You won the choose.
I knew it. I always felt different.
Is she the only girl in the whole world? Why can't you get find your own girl?
It's not me! It's the car!
I'm sure he'll be back in a second.
Hey.
Clock over there. (to chauffer) O'Brien.
I am never saying 'I love you' again unless they say it first.
(To Elaine) Hey, what happened?
All right go ahead Susan, tell him.
(frustrated) Fine. Fine. (to customer) Excuse me. (heading for the door) Think I'm gonna forget about this? I haven't forgotten about this. I don't forget that easily!
No!
Believe me, I am not crazy.
Why not? Why not?
Just..go back. Pretend the whole thing never happened.
Hey, hey, hey! I dig.
"These pretzels are making me thirsty"? That was one line! You got fired!
Is that good?
You talked all about that?
No, of course not...
What is that? Is taht the pole?!
Hey, hey, hey!
So, attractive one day - not attractive the next?
Almost. Couldn't get the girl go out with me the second time.
(distracted) Mm? (acknowledges Katy) Oh, hi. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. We met uh, skiing that time. You're uh, married to the eye guy.
(animated) It failed here! Because, here, every time you turn on a TV, all you see is four morons sitting round an apartment, whining about their dates!
Not everybody knows what the crop circles are. (to the newsstand owner) Do you know what the crop circles are?
(trying to laugh it off) Right. C'mon! I'm having an affair with Elaine?! If I was having an affair with Elaine, I wouldn't tell you I'm going to see Elaine. I would make up some other person to tell you I was gonna go see, and then I would go see Ela..Elaine.
I can do hard time for this one. And community service!
(enthusiastic) Yeah. You get a couch. I get rid of my father. It couldn't be more perfect!
No, no, not really. Ever since Susan passed on, I have good days and bad. (Turns the briefcase towards the woman on his left.) Some days, I'm haunted by one word - why. Why Susan? Why wasn't it me licking those invitations? Why am I still here? Well, I gotta run. (Gets up and leaves the meeting.)
Well you know, if you were sitting right next to her you'd have to console her no matter what.
Yeah. A couple of people. I don't get that, though. Where do you start?
'My wife's in a coma.' Yeah? Well, the life support machine called and...
Can we move on?
Get going? But we haven't really, you know....
(Let down) Yeah, but you - you promised it to me.
Excuse me, sir, do you have the time?
What-what are you doing?
Hey look a that - boy are you lucky - another great spot - right in front of the hospital. In an emergency yet! How lucky are you huh? Is that unbelievable? How unbelievable is that huh? Come on, give it to me, give it to me.
And I'd like a discount.
Yes, yes I am.
(positive) Yes. From endorsing checks for the Super Terrific Happy Hour. (laughs)
What?
Yeah.
Yeah, okay.
I need an outlet!
Wait a minute, that is my apartment. I earned it with 34 years of misery!
Ma, don't cry!
I heard the last guy got fired because his nose whislted.
So how long did you live there?
(Boiling) What am I going to say?!
Yeah, right.
Yeah.
Sweet Fancy Moses!
Alright, so, go ahead.
You disappoint me, my friend. Sandy wants nothing to do with you. She tells Laura, "If you want to waste your time with that pervert, that's your problem."
No one hails a cab like me. My hailing technique is unmatched. I get the wrist going from side to side and boom! Cabs are crashing into themselves to just pick me up. (a cab stops) All right, here we go. Let me get door. Feminists aside, I know women like the door holding. Here we are all righty. O.K. Jodi let's get together again real soon and say hello to your sister for me.
I dont know. But Simons said that if I wanted to get involved, that Wilkinson would tell me the exact right minute to sell. You wanna do it?
Give me one.
Just nice?
Be right with you. Look Mr. Steinbrenner.
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
Feels right. (cheerfully takes another bite)
I'll shout.
I got scared there for a second. The Knicks without Ewing.
You don't think I can keep a secret?
Really?
No, no, no. Nothing happens.
I gotta call her. Should I call her?
I loved her Jerry, I loved her.
What are you talking about?
All right!
I didnt think ahead.
You know, that, that thing about her being too good for him. I mean, I was just bein' folksy. They could tell I was just being folksy..?
I tell you, when she threw that toupee out the window, it was the best thing that ever happened to me. I feel like my old self again. Totally inadequate, completely insecure, paranoid, neurotic, it's a pleasure.
Oxygen! I need some oxygen! This is major.
Your clothes smell just like Pisano's. There's another Italian place on Jerome. Maybe I can fool him.
Where are you gettin' a Wizard for fifty dollars?
No, it's, it's his. (indicates Jerry)
(leaving) That'll do.
Yeah.
What's gonna happen? They can't kill us.
Why don't you just ask him?
I tell ya, I hear people really stuff themselves on those cruise ships. (Laughs) The buffet, that's the real ordeal, huh, Clarence? (Laughs)
Oh, sure. Of course. (looks for place to set down flowers) Um, uh, could you hold these? For just a second, just a second. (grabs newspapers from trash bin, begins wiping windshield) Here you go, now don't worry about a thing. It's gonna be fine. Here we go. Look at this shine.
So is it all over between you and... Marsha Mason?
Excuse me. Am I talking to you, Pinhead? Am I?!
(smiling) I'm on a winning ball club, Jerry. They probably wanna pick my brains.
'Hoochie mama'?
Never thought I'd fail at failing.
Babs left?
I dont like to discuss figures.
I don't know.
They have no friends.
Me?
Oh, see? that's why I don't have cable in my house. Because of that naked station. If I had that in my house, I would never turn it off. I wouldn't sleep, I wouldn't eat. Eventually, firemen would have to break through the door, they'd find me sitting there in my pajamas with drool coming down my face. All right, all right. So you're watching the naked station.
Yes! Yes! Everybody has to like me. I must be liked!
(going into the bathroom) Well, you on all fours, that thing vibratin', kickin' up sawdust, ho ho! She'll get the picture!
You know what you oughta do. You should go to her office and heckle her.
Well, losing a loved is, uh...I mean, forget about it. (Starts wolfing down the sandwiches.)
yeah....euh...I dunno What?
What do you mean?
(Letting his conscious get the best of him) I wonder how Susan's father's going to react to this. Alright, what- what's the worst he could do? So you burn a cabin down..
A... ah...
Wow.
(muttering)
I think Play Now is putting something in my food.
Yeah?
Uh, no, I, I dont think so.
(pauses for a few seconds) OK, I'm tellin' you right now - if your kiddin' around I'm not gonna be able to be your friend anymore. I'm serious about that. You got that.
Okay. Good.
Wha-Is that the one your parents gave you?
Hey, thanks for coming with me.
Uh-huh.
What about your old car? They couldn't get Kramer's blood out of it?
No! I don't! Don't you even care? This is your company! It's your name on the outside of the building! Speaking of which, the 'R' fell off and all it says now is K-uger!
I think I can sum up the show for you with one word NOTHING.
I told her what a sexist he is. How he cheats on his wife.
Well, they're more than an underwear to me Mr. Farkus. Two cups in the front, two loops in the back. How do they do it?
You pick it.
No. Now I'll always have this doubt about the car. What, your jaw still hurts?
Say? What? Nothing, I...
Those are Susan's friends.
I thought tomorrow maybe we'd try a little corn beef.
I did, I'm trying to call China.
Let me see the watch.
She tolerated the strawberries and the chocolate sauce, but eh, it's not a meal, you know? Food and sex, those are my two passions. It's only natural to combine them.
Yes! 860,000. I can't believe it's still standing. No one has beaten me in like 10 years.
Well, whoever he was, he knew a lot about The A-Team!
(Laughs nervously) ..Ulterior motive.
I don't have a flush.
But I-I-I-
Should I apologize to Woody?
What?
Sure. I could go the tomato route. But eh, I've given this a lot of thought Jerry. All that frustration. Ill never get any work done. So Im doing a complete 360. Im going for total efficiency and ability.
See, this should be a show. This is the show.
Boom!
No, Jerry, don't call.
That's like using a wheelchair for the fun of it!
(anxious) I forgot who I am! Who am I?!
(very worried) Uhm, I, I gotta go.
Hey!
Well, why don't *you* go, and I could save the seats. You said you didn't like saving anyway.
In every situation. No matter how silly I look. (Tastes his Clams Casino) Hm.. tastes a little funky.
No, no, no, this suit is not for sale. (tries to take off the suit from the guy)
Into the hole?
No no no, he's not getting away with this.
Why is the mailman wearing a bucket?
Elaine, shut-up.
Purple 23.
Yeah, yeah, should've written it down.
Unbelievable, I'm never gonna get out of here. The guy goes to pee, he never comes back. It's like a science fiction story.
Hotel.
Yeah. Thanks for, thanks for coming by fellas. Eh, got a set of keys, buried in the pothole.
(In a state of hysteria) I'm an eggplant! I'm an eggplant! I'm a minstrel man!
Kramer, Kramer's not here...I knew it. I knew it! I knew this would happen. (SCREAMING) Kramer! Kramer!
Ha ha. Everything's timed out to perfection, Jerry. Slippery Pete's got the Frogger running on battery power, the truck will be there any minute, and Kramer's taped out the loading zone.
I guess you two are the lucky ones.
(improvising) My uh uncle is having an operation. I just wanted to see how he was.
Sure, Guatamala...
(Losing it) Funny guy!
So where are you staying?
(answering the phone while walking away) Joe Mayo's apartment?
Where?
Hey listen... umm, instead of the movie... uh, maybe we'll go back and uh you know...(nudges her head with his head)
(over the speaker) It's George.
Really?
Glad you enjoyed it.
What if he's waiting for me outside? He pointed at me! Did you see him point?!
I'm going to a poetry reading with PATRICE First time poets, in a burnt out building, down by the docks, Supposed to be good.
No, you're not out there.
"He jumps!"
Aw c'mon. It's a fantastic name. It's a real original, nobody else is gonna have it and I absolutely love it.
You're my mother! What wouldn't I do for you?
Great.
Yeah, and you were engaged for like a minute, I was engaged for a year.
(Frantically) Jerry, Jerry?
You got odds.
Perhaps. (hehe) I walk in, everything is organized -- messages, appointments. And I can't tell you how proud I am of myself for going with Ade.
Me either. Is there anything you can do to shut them up?
He probably doesn't want to get chocolate on his fingers. That's the way these society types eat their candy bars.
Come on! Come on!
Ah, Just double park.
The busboy's coming?
No, of course not.
I was telling you about Noel.
(Getting frustrated) I know.
(to Danielle) Whose cane is this?
Why don't you think before you do something?
Dad, he doesn't need to see the pole.
Can I go like this?
This is for you.
What a bald paradise that must have been. Nobody knew.
I'm afraid I'm just not interested in how I present myself. If those kind of superficialities are important to you, this probably isn't gonna work.
Im good.
I know. I can tell. It's one of my powers. Why, did you ever fake?
No.
See now this I don't get.
No, its not a problem, I can get rid of the apartment this afternoon.
Told me to "Go to hell!" and I took the bus home.
(To the store owner) Excuse me, what do you think of these?
The place went nuts.
(startled) Oh!
(takes a bite) Oh, that's good. That's very good.
No.
Ok, it's a deal!
Betsy.
What?
What did Jodi say?
I've tried. We don't have it. But maybe the two of us, working together at full capacity, could do the job of one normal man.
Oh yeah.
So, Lena was upset, huh?
Hey, Nina! (beat) I owe you some money, don't I?
It's a talent I have.
What are you talking about?
(gleeful, to Estelle) You did?! That's Goood! That's very good! I'm very glad to hear that.
Yes. A male roommate.
My Darling Susan! My DARLING!!!
Awright, listen, can you uh, gimme a lift back to my place?
Oh my God, I forgot!
Yeah. I am like a drug dealer. I got the guy hooked. I am having lunch at his desk everyday this week. He doesn't make a move without me. It's very exciting.
Yeah, "duty". Do you know how much duty is?
Hey, last night, I found a whole Weeble Village right behind the EZ Bake oven.
Jerry, I'm Yankee management.
This is the life! Isn't it, huh, kid?
I think she finds my stupidity charming.
Boy!
Aw great. Now the volume knob fell off
What for?
Listen, I gotta ask you I was a little concerned that perhaps I was responsible in some way for your, uh... metamorphosis.
(waves his hands) Big breasts!
What do you mean?
I had no idea.
There you go, okay? That's my *other* friend's ticket. You happy now? You got two tickets.
(PROUDLY) Me too.
Well... what if you showed up bad naked, huh? You still got that belt sander?
(mildly embarrassed) yeah.. Thank you.
Me too, really. Unless you'd really like to get one.
Here we go.
(Puts nuts into his mouth, and in the process covers his mouth) We bring her to the party, and she can tell me what Gwen is saying about me.
So he... had his hands and, uh, he was uh
Why don't you just commit yourself already?
Ava was one of the reasons I used to like going to work, she was a friend. Now we sleep together and suddenly, I don't know how to talk to her. Every time I go to the bathroom I pass her desk. I have to plan little patter. I spend half my day writing. Then afterwards, I sit in my office and analyze how it went. If it was a good conversation, I don't go to the bathroom for the rest of the day. I see her laughing and talking with other people, they're all so loose and relaxed, I think, 'that used to be me. I want to go back there again.'
Wait, have you ever seen him throw up?!
Um, cream soda?
uh-uh. What's with the bucket?
It better be.
I'm the consolation guy...?
(Getting up, he addresses Jerry) All right, remember no rust-proofing. Commit to nothing. If you have to speak - mumble.
What's to think about? If Putty says it's what it is, it's what it is. He's not gonna cheat you.
Oh, I was gonna pay for this.
'Kay. I'll uh, I'll see you later. Anybody want some tomatoes?
I don't know. This sandwich is making me flush.
This guy sounds just like me.
I think we got a bite on it. (Exits)
Well, you gotta do it.
No, Im saying, if a situation arose in which you didnt want it, I might take it.
My *father* is gay...
So uh... Wrath of Khan, huh?
I really like those sons of bitches.
(signs) Sorry. (expectant) You're sure, uh, there isn't anything else?
You already have an in. You have the same first name!... (no reaction) 'Jerry'!
Ha, because I love Drakes Coffee Cake.
she's there, I can hear her
You don't speak *any* English?
(impatient) For her. Not for you.
You know it's like you never see a really attractive woman getting a traffic ticket.
Nope!
My heart! My heart! (To Assistant) Where you going? Are you crazy?!
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's in the vault. I'm putting it in the vault.
Briefcase. (Shrugs and exits.)
Start what?
(desperate) Please! I have so little!
[trying to act as if he doesn't care one way or the other, but we know better] Either way.
I dont know. All of em. Theyre all crooks! Besides, I couldnt get all different candy bars, anyway.
Yeah, why? Why?
The parakeet in the mirror. That's a good one, Stu.
Ive had my difficulties.
I hear everything.
[Realizing full well it isn't] ...Yes it is.
Married , What!(astounded)
(animated) Then I'm going to Mars!
Yeah, yeah, but he doesn't wear glasses.
Puke! That's a funny word. Puke. (laughing) Puke! Don't have to think about that.
Yeah I'm, eh, in 'the market'.
So, anything to uh, nosh?
What?
I told you, I told you! Ha ha ha! Ooh ooh!
Done what?
It's George.
There's Elaine.
That?s-that?s-Harry Fong, he's a very good friend of mine and he's a big opera buff. Enjoy the show there harry!... You know what.
You're telling me. (he walks around and the suit makes a swooshing sound) So, what do you think?
Well, my father works for the United Volunteers, maybe he can get her one.
You spoke to my mother?
Yeah my parents have it. Sometimes it skips a generation.
You didn't tell her.
Susan B. Anthony** I think I'd have a problem with.
What?
Who's your favorite chess player?
I think I'd be good at that. I talk to people all the time. Someone even told me once they thought I'd be a good talk show host.
'Cause believe me, I would only say this to you and maybe a psychiatrist, maybe. Well, her nose is a little big.
I guess that leaves me in the clear...
Boy, my knuckles are still cramped from that football game.
Oh, so you don't believe me either?
Really?
(interrupting) Elaine. Shut up.
Hey, did I tell you I called one of those girls from the personal ads in The Daily Worker?
I'll die out here.
No problem. There's no problem. She just owes me ten dollars, that's all.
No! No.
Bania?
Let's work on the card.
All right, shes not even gonna ask, if we see her, which is remote.
Where?
You know, we absolutely should.
Do you know the last time I wore this thing? Six years ago, when I made that toast at Bobby Leighton's wedding.
No, I brought a picture of the chair.
[as if the word were totally foreign] My `stub'?
Hey, it's George. Listen, I-
Jerry.
She works for NBC.
. . . WELL IT WAS A BIG SALAD. AND WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IS, HOW DOES A PERSON WHO HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE BIG SALAD CLAIM RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT SALAD AND ACCEPT THE THANK YOU UNDER FALSE PRETENSES - AH - AH?
It's Moops.
Yes, well, I sat down with Mr. Steinbrenner. I told him you have been doing great work. I said that you deserved a raise, and if you didnt get it, that I, was leaving. (motions with both arms in a circular motion to his right)
Hey, do you know, Bonnie, I just had a pretty wild idea.
I show up.
Yes, please.
So he walks out of the stall, he's been talking the whole time.
Is that it?
I think that's Mr. Hayman. ...The gym teacher from our High School.
You know, uh, she has no female friends! You know that, don't cha? Something strange about a woman whos friends are all men.
Oh I would love that. You think he'd really do it?
No, that's right, I didn't. I take full responsibility for the card not being here. I, uh, . . .
Five-foot four. Why?
Muy sumpatico. Muy muy muy.
You had dinner with the Seinfelds'?
You are ruinin' everything.
Yeah,yeah!! I'll pick you up right now.....All right All right....Hey! gotta go.
Hey, Jerry, remember Frogger? I used to be so into this game. Gettin' that frog across the street was my entire life.
Keith, Keith Wa What happened? Where's Keith?
Yeah, yeah, like it's just part of the conversation. Oh my boyfriend really likes watches. He's a real watch freak. We-e-ell that's fabulous. (snaps fingers in the air a couple of times)
I mean, batteries have gone dead before, aren't they prepared for that?
Don't you see how wrong that is?! Where's your Christmas spirit? And eye for an eye!
What?
(still pleased) She doesn't know that. We say that you do.
Elaine and her sponges...she's got like, a war chest full of them.
Yes I look forward to many years of... looking at the triangles. Well, I'll ah, I'll wait for you outside.
I was naked.
Blackberry, Boysenberry ...
Why not?
I don't know, she lives right around the corner. You could take it here or go to the coffee shop.
I'll tell ya, if I ever get out of here, I'm gonna change my life. I'm gonna do a whole Zen thing. Take up yoga, meditate.. I'll eat right. Calm down, lose my anger.. (Sees Jerry and Elaine aren't listening. He snaps) Hey, is anybody listening?!
Elaine...let me just explain something to you. See, this is not just a weekend routine...I'm on the verge of make-up sex here. You know about make-up sex?
So, that's it. All of my darkest fears, and... everything I'm capable of. That's me.
No good? All right, uh how about Art... Cor.....
So, you need me to get fired.
No I didn't!
I see, well, thats open to interpretation. Because so much depends on the layering and the quality of the wetness in the eyes.
Who is this? (sees photo)
What number?
Kramer?
Well, I think this is it.
Well, maybe not married, but...
Nah, with crutches it's a funny story, with a cane it's a sad story. You through with those?
Oh mother of God.
Did you ask her?
It's like, all dented.
Yes, she hates cigarettes.
Oh.
You could pet them. They come right out of the water onto the sidewalks.
I lost it.
So what? What am I supposed to do?
Too much?
Because it's on TV.
Oh.
You won't think I'm a bad person?
You're right. Why must there always be a problem? You'd think just once I could get a break. God knows I earned it with that score!
I told I had a bus transfer that was only good just for another hour.
Why?! Because you were stabbed, and.. got coffee thrown in your face, and.. uh.. (Points to Alan's bandaged forehead)
No, no...
(at dinner with his cousin) Some more merlot?
Alright the administrator's on the third floor. I'll meet you guys back at the car.
How much tip do you leave on $8.15?
Why not?
Well, it's not that. I just, you know, I thought that we were both uh...
Excuse me, are you going to be much longer? I have to make a very important call.
You mean just walk into the staff meeting on Monday morning like it never happened?
Oh, boy. Here she comes.
I...was trying to lead the way. We needed a leader! Someone to lead the way to safety.
Jerry it's funny, Paula and I actually met because of Elaine.
(into phone, frantic) Mister Dalrimple! Mister Dalrimple I have to talk to you!
Because? Because?
Well played.
Hey hey hey, check me out, huh?
Check, please.
I dont know. But he aint funny.
Was she mad?
I told you to stop with the hopping.
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, go. Go about your business, I'll just wander around.
I think you absolutely have to say something to this guy. Confront him.
(standing up, still acting) Uhh! I'm caught in my own web of lies! (holds his hands up in surrender)
Yeah, yeah, she's here.
Ahh! (closes his eyes and rolling his head back) Umh!
You have a car?
Oh - comfort, schmomfort. Listen, Father, can I ask you a question? In a terrible time like this...who would I get the death certificate from?
Good, let her think it.
Oh, it's a bad day. Uh, you got everyone in your house, you're thinkin', "These are my friends?!"
Let me just see it.
Ah ha, well, I really wouldn't know about that. I don't watch much TV. I like to read. So what do you do, a lot of that "did you ever notice?" this kind of stuff.
Hey, speaking of which, I found a great way to separate the skin from the top of the pudding without leaving any around the edges; Exacto knife.
What?
If I do it, will you buy a computer?
Yeah, good luck. Hey I'll meet you outside.
51 people?! That's it?! I thought it was, like, a thousand!
Oh, no, that's just the old, uh, the old handicap acting up.
Of course not...
I still haven't figured him out.
You almost did the nose.
(from other room) Uh, tippy toe! Tippy toe! Lemon tree!
Please, doctor.
Yes! And I put him up to it, because I'm sick! I'm the one that needs help.
It's, funny runnin' into you here.
I swear, I swear!
I got nothing.
Well, here you go. What do you think?
(pulling out some money) Uh, yeah. Hang on. Just... yeah.
And, um, it was quite good. In fact, you even incorporated me into the show. I'm not actually a performer. Although, my parents felt I had talent..
No, I want to go.
I don't think so I know so, Kramer, come here I got to talk to you
Oh, cmon, Jerry. I cant believe this.
The sex wasn't so good?
See?
Oh, well, he was probably just getting anxious to start his vacation.
Just enjoying watching you.
So, she went out with you on a first date.. and it was her birthday?
There she is. (waiving his arms quickly above the table - to nix the conversation) No no no no no no.
You faked?
No, no, this is supposed to go to Joe Mayo's apartment.
Oh I'm seeing someone, yes. You know her, Daphne Bower.
Elaine.
How can you call yourself a clown and not know who Bozo is?
Tightness..
Maybe.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. You can't say anything. (rushes to take phone from Jerry)
All right. All right. Let's not get into panic mode! Let's not make a big deal outta this thing or we're never gonna get through this night.
(To Kramer) You want to start?
No, you go Guggenheim. I'm not much of a Guggenheim.
No, I'm a friend of Elaine Benes.
(Sarcastic) Yeah, performance artist. She's a real performer. A real trooper.
I was just wondering what it was you wanted for dessert.
Yeah.
Fine. (hits his arm on the desk) Ow!
One of your guys - Kip, or Ned, short name - stole my Twix candy bar!
She confused "six" with "sex"?
King Edward. (snapping his fingers) King Edward, Jerry.
Likewise.
Want a bite?
(bashful) No, that's me.
Yeah. I did some shopping. Some new clothes shopping. (turns to a man) Can I borrow your menu?
You don't like the move?
She, uh, went shopping for some shoes for the wedding and, yada yada yada, I'll see her in six to eight months. (Kramer and Julie enter)
I'm going out with her tomorrow, she said she had some errands to run.
What about jewelry? That's very nice gift.
I got to get downtown and buy that suit. The store opens in twenty minutes.
So, I guess I was lucky that I never tried that myself.
I don't like when a woman says, 'Make love to me', it's intimidating. The last time a woman said that to me, I wound up apologizing to her.
I know it may sound shocking. But, I just can't stop myself from... wanting you.
Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot. I'll pay you back.
(excited) So then, as we were leaving, we were just kind of standing there, and she was sort of smiling at me, and I wasnt sure if she wanted me to ask her out, because when women smile at me I dont know what it means. Sometimes I interpret it like theyre psychotic or something and I dont know if Im supposed to smile back, I dont know what to do. So I just stood there like  remember how Quayle looked when Benson gave him that Kennedy line? Thats what I looked like.
Oh that's OK, really, don't worry about it.
The side?
Yeah, that was enough.
What are you doing here, I though you were going to the airport.
Is it a clockwise swirl?
I'm sorry, umm he-here's your money back (gives Rudy the money back) I-I-I'll have the clothes.
Hey.
Yeah.
People can drop change down here, Jerry. And theyre too lazy to pick it up.
She didn't like me?
All right, let's--let's focus. Can we get back to the plan?
I don't know. He said he wants to be my "key brother."
These kids called me a Mary.
(surprise) Huh. I never heard you say you admire me for anything.
(Struggling) No, no, no, no. I can walk it off. It's a hundred and twenty degrees in here.. I'll sweat it out.
Wo-hoah! What did you do?
What do you think about a rocking chair?
...and the Jews steal our money through their Zionist occupied government and use the black man to bring drugs into our oppressed white minority communities.
Alright, I gotta go. I'm heading over to Bonnie's.
I don't know, I have to call her, tell her where we are. I'm very lucky she's even considering seeing me at all.
Thank you! Thank you very much. (Jerry and Melissa stop and look at George)
Yeah, sure. (big smile) Then my father will have no place to sleep. (snaps fingers) He's gotta move out.
I got a feeling I'm gonna be much smarter than you pretty soon.
Thats why, you know, a shake is bad.
Susan! Jerry! Where are you? I know you're there! Answer me!
For lunch? Who eats eggs for lunch?
It's just paper on a roll, that's it. And that's all it will ever be.
Do you have your bathing suits?
Well, Play Now is through playing. They turned the heat way up in my office. They tried to sweat me out.
Alrighty, so. That's one tuck and one no-tuck. Got that?
I don't understand. Paper Machay hats?
What?
Oh, no no no. I pay what I say.
She cant kill me right?
What?
So she starts vaccuming, back and forth, back and forth, her hips swivelling, her breasts, uh... (trying to think of a word)
Really?
I know what I'm doin'. In fact Mr. Wilhelm gave me one of those little stress dolls. All right. (gets up) Back to work. (acts annoyed and leaves)
(To Jane) You know, when I was a kid, I once found a dollar and fifty cents in change on the bottom of the pool.
It's like the manager coming out and asking you for the ball.
What do you mean "might"? You don't think he really owned this car?
Pounded?
Yeah so??
I'll try a piece.
What is that with the shmoopy?
For vomiting on her vest!
Nine minutes.
Hey Fred.
And isn't it more fun using the urinal?
(muttering to himself) I wonder why.
Oh, hey, sorry I'm late.
Whe ... Well yeah!
Depends on what?
So?
He'd just be touching your back too.
How about Chinese?
Couldnt be better.
Where's the depravity?
Oh my god, maybe Gwen saw it. Maybe that's what did it.
Yes, sir.
You know, I think we really need to be in front of a television set. You take T.V. out of this relationship, it is *just* torture.
You know, I'm down to one kiss hello. My aunt Sylvia.
I can't go anywhere, I have to wait here for Tatiana's call. Let me just check.
Yeah, take care. Stay in touch.
My face! My face! Get me to the hospital!
I know a little. Besides, what do you have to know?
hu, Coffee. Too much coffee (nervous laughter).
Can't hurt you.
You're kidding.
You can go crazy trying to figure that place out.
I was in the middle of a conversation.
Well at least you and I are talking about how there's nothing to talk about.
I don't know.
Can't go, Why not?
Yap..
Ah, Alright, before that, I was in real estate. I quit, because the boss wouldn't let me use his private bathroom. That was it.
Well I I ..put a lot of thought into this and I think I would like you to sign a prenuptual agreement.
Oh my God. I just remembered where I left my retainer in second grade. I'll see ya. (He throws finished Rubik's cube to Jerry and he exits. Kramer enters)
Strawberry, Cranberry ...
I'll tell you what, if pig-man shows up, we'll squeeze him in. I'll see you later.
(tearing out cheque) Yeah, same time. (hands over cheque) There you go.
If you're in some situation where some fast cash will save your life, I'll give you the code.
What d'you mean, let 'em go? They're spending all my money.
What're you gonna do now?
Jerry? Jerry! I'm busting! I'm busting!
Was the alarm on?
Well, it's all over. I slipped up.
What?
Because filth is good. Whaddaya think, rock stars have sponges and ammonia lyin around the bathroom? They, have a woman comin over, Ive gotta tidy up? Yeah right, in these matters you never do what your instincts tell you. Always, ALWAYS do the opposite.
When are you going on your next date with her?
KEITH HERNANDEZ?
He knows that!
It's all your fault! You and Elaine! All that orgasm talk. She did have an orgasm, she didn't have an orgasm. Orgasm this, orgasm that. I got so focused on it. I started to panic and boom, I lost it. I tried everything, I was talking to him 'Please wake up, do something.'
Ohooo what are we going to do? I'm shaking! I'm shaking!
Oh, no. No stories.
No, I uh...
What happened to your voice?
Aw right YES! GUM! Good enough I'll take it.
Hey, at least I'm bringing something to this. (Starts flipping through envelopes, reads one ) "Have you seen me?" (Flicks it aside) Nope. (looks at next envelope) Woah, something from Whatley.
Ouch!
There was a box of raisins on the coffee table. Did you, by any chance, take them with you when left?
Where are you meeting these women? When they get off the bus at the port authority?
Gotta go.
Silence YES!!
Well all right, beautiful, so you stop in. Ya, ya visit the bubble boy for twenty minutes and then we can go.
What kind of a sick impulse does that??
You might want to try it...makes the movie more enjoyable, that's all.
You never played Vegas.
You dont have to call that! Thats a rule!
(grabbing his jacket) Hey oo, I just remembered uh my parents really wanna have you guys over for dinner before you leave town. What about tonight?
Hi. I'm ah, I'm here to see a Mr. Art Vandelay..
(angry, to himself) The ocean called. Running outta shrimp. Outta shrimp! (a thought occurs) Oh! Yes! That's what I shoulda said! (frustrated shout) Dammit!
Yeah, I turned him down.
So how long has it been in the basement?
So, what do you think?
You know, Jason, I, uh, I couldn't help notice, I... I didn't get my apology.
No! No!!
Oh, it had to happen!!
(points) And him!
If it makes you happy, I don't focus on these things. I will tell you this Unfortunately, we live in a very superficial society. I don't condone it, but it's a fact of life.
She says she has to come to New York on business...
Pamela?! Awright, I tell you what. You look like nice people, I'm gonna help you out. You want a beautiful name? Soda.
Hey. I gotta go.
You know my last name is Costanza. That's Italian. So you and I are like country men. Pisano's!
You see? Now that is a handsome man. (Elaine and Jerry look right at George) Oh please.
Oh ho! Class, huh? At Columbia? Let me tell you something, pal. I called the registrars office. I checked you out. They have no record of a Ray Thomas at that school! You liar!
That's what I'm trying to find out.
Oh, she didn't think it was funny. What is she, Rowan & Martin? We're supposed to meet with NBC tomorrow! She completely shattered my confidence. And I'm paying for this, she's my employee!
I'm going.
(smiling) What about Sharon Besser?
Do they pay people to watch movies?
Huh. Excuse me (to Ping) Hum... Do you speak chinese?
Kramer, trust me, this is the best bathroom in midtown!
I think he's saying 'Son of Sam'! Oh, my God!
Me neither.
Her scalp was clean. She had a nice skull. There just wasn't a lot of hair on it.
(In a really strange way) Good, good, do that.
Hey, 'The White Shadow' is on...
From my pocket.
Now, see here, doctor.
Uh, I'm sorry, I can't do this..
This is dating , you can't leave anything to chance.
Convulsing?
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas! (Co-worker gives a gift to George) Oh, Sandy! Here is a little something for you.. (hands her a card)
I didn't have make-up sex.
Oh, I know.
You spritz a little Lysol on it.
Tragic.
Its your apartment!
Oh no - I'm so sorry, it's the Moops. The correct answer is the Moops.
I might go there.
The show! Forget about the show! We should take the idea to a different network
??? sir.
Hi Elaine
Alright, well you know what'cha gotta do, you gotta go through her purse. Y'know, the-the credit cards, driver's license...
(wry) He knows.
(picking up what Frank saw as a mouse) It's the remote.
Hey check this out. I go to pick up my pictures and she says " I hope you got that mustard stain out of your shirt."
Hello, Rick.
I, I couldnt wait. I was too anxious to see you.
Right.. the sign. (Hesitates, then makes a series of stupid gestures)
(Attempting to spell his last name) D-A-L-R-I-M-P-E-L?
Well, did you see it?
I think that's mine.
Look at this sparkle. (looks up, sees Lindsay's mother) Mrs. Enright! (runs after her) Mrs. Enright! Mrs. Enright!
Ok, we got your...got your strawberries, your chocolate sauce, your pastrami on rye with mustard, your honey...
(waving) How can I not think about it? Look at the size of this thing.
Now, if this mechanic guy, was, in fact, eating a 5th Avenue bar, as he claims, wouldnt you agree he would have no problem picking one out from a candy line-up?
I like sports. I could do something in sports.
Excuse me, did you say 'Raymond'?
Hey. How's your day, good?
(Yelling out to the whole coach) Funny guy! (Points to Jerry) Right here!
So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified! But I pressed on -- and as I made my way passed the breakers a strange calm came over me. I-I don't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment  I was a Marine Biologist!
Yeah, yeah.
Well she was sending out our wedding invitations.
All right, but we're not buyin' it at Bloomingdale's. I will buy it, you pay me back later. I'll sniff out a deal. I have a sixth sense.
Always late. Always late.
(Reluctantly) Yeah.
I didnt know there was a fireplace. A fireplace, that's incredible.
No forget the story.
(animated) Fixed up? A cup of coffee! A cup of coffee is not a fix up!
No, I don't know. How do I know the usual?
(angry shout) So am I!
Let me ask you something. What do you do for a living, Newman?
No no no, no mistake, no mistake. No, no , listen, we're going to get married over Christmas, I It doesn't make any difference to me. It's fine. Really.
Yeah.
"It's the Kom Pau ... George likes his chicken spicy."
The Jon Voight car is no more.
Alright! Please, please! I cannot have this constant bickering!.. Stress is very damaging to the epidermis! Now, I have an important photo session in the morning - my hands have got to be in tip-top shape, so please - keep the television down, and the conversation to a minimum.
Good afternoon. One large crab bisque to go. Bread. Beautiful.
Hey oh.
(getting excited) That's, that's incredible. My Cousin Vinnie, I love her, she was fantastic!
Yeah.
George Costanza. Susan's, uh, friend? Long time no speak.
Ooh, a shower cap!
So, they knew? Those liars!
Yeah.
It's, uh, it's not a little chicken. (laughing) Little chicken. It's a gamebird.
(spotting possible salvation) You know what, I urge you to take it up with him. Go ahead, give him a call, he'll tell you what I'm doing here. (half to himself) Then you can tell me.
Good. Of course...
You know, they say ostrich has less fat, but you eat more of it.
Oh, that's a dangerous fruit. It's like a weapon that thing, got spikes on the end. You can get killed from one of those things.
Yeah. Never seen anyone so bored. I'm working like a dog here. Give me a moan. *Something*. I'd settle for a belch, for god's sake. All right, come on, let's have it.
It's two completely different sounds. "ih" and "eh".
I just pray Kruger doesn't realize that it's gone until this guy can fix it up.
Oh, no no no, I'm fine. Let me help you with these dishes, huh?
Jerry, I've been preparing for this moment my entire life.
Right, right.
My place? NO, no, no. I hate my place. I don't wanna go back to my place.
Uh, excuse me. Uh, pound of Arabian mocha java, please.
No, not that I know of. (winks)
good thing I asked
I dont know. Just start scratching. Tell him you have the crabs. He was in the military. Hell understand that.
Hey. How come I didn't get a Christmas card? Everybody else got one. Jerry got one, Kramer got one. I thought we were good friends. I don't get a Christmas card. I don't get it.
He knows?
Jon Voight! Are you kiddin' me? Did you talk to him?
Jerry took the flyers off the car, I got the whole thing covered.
Hup! Hup!
I know, I know. Listen, your stuff has to be done by now, why dont you just see if its dry?
(sitting down next to Jerry) Seeing Maura. Apparently, I was unable to break up beyond a reasonable doubt.
No! I'm not gonna do that! That's one step away from personal ads! And prostitutes! No! No, I am not going down that road! What does she look like?
Yes. The New Yorker.
I know they're in there, the three of them, laughing at me. Together, laughing and lying.
God! She's cooking dinner for God! She's yelling and screaming, and the next thing I know, she throws a big can of chocolate syrup all over my new red shirt.
You're friends with Marisa Tomei?
25 kids for his birthday party? (to kid under table) Don't put your tongue on the floor! He's putting his tongue on the floor! Here, here, have some more sugar packets. (tosses some Equal packets under the table)
That's it.
I gotta buy a present now?
Yeah. I think we really go something here.
A man gave me...
So you can't duplicate 'em.
Hey.
You'll do it?
Nnnnnnngaaa!
Isn't polite to say Hello when somebody says hello?
So, just bring her here. This is all you really need.
Did she say Hello?
You must be very proud Mr. Visaki. (shaking his hand) And may I say sir they're lovely girls, absolutely lovely girls. It's nice to see such fine upstanding women in gainful employment, Mr. Visaki.
I saw "Titanic". So that old woman, she's just a liar, right?
You know what I do at the Yankees, when one of these old guys is breathing down my neck?
Me neither!
It wasn't funny? What, are you kidding?
You telling me that wine is better than Pepsi? Huh (snort), no way wine is better than Pepsi.
yeah
George.. (She doesn't seem to recognize him) George Costanza.
I'd argue if I could, Mrs. Enright. (exits) Here we go, all right.
What about candle holders?
Well, I think we need more special days at the stadium, you know? Like, uh...Joe Pepitone Day. Or, uh...Jon Voight Day.
Well, uh, are there any other options?
Payroll!!
No. Believe me, he's not.
That's it? You don't have to screw it in or anything?
Makes the 11 gauge look like a cap pistol.
JERRY! What happened to you?
I'm gonna slip him a mickey.
Without thousands of fleeing Japanese.
(Muttering, slow) Hang on, Ma.. hang on..
SHEILA!!!
You're in latex
What'd I do?
What?
Two theaters?
Yup.
I cant believe I said that. You know me, Im a vault.
No, they're not funny at all. No, I have no funny friends. I'm the funny one. El Clowno.
No way.
Ah, ah, twenty to three.
Im outta there. I did it! Its over.
No.
Mine!
I didn't get any bread.
Oh, sports are so pedestrian. I've prepared some science experiments that will illuminate the mind and dazzle the eye.
Aww.
She didn't want to come, she-she's not really into sports.
That's a great idea!!!
Well I just got back from swimming in the pool. And the water was cold...
You broke up with her? Why?
(holds eyes wide open) Get it back!
I know!
Yes. Changes.
The Switch?
Guess, what I got.
A hundred dollars.
Hey
Yeah, right.
Dead?
".....Well. I'm sorry. Call you right back."
Why do I get pesto? Why do I think I'll like it? I keep trying to like it, like I have to like it.
What?
Look at where we are! (referring to the seat usher) He's not stopping! He just keeps going and going and going! (the usher abruptly stops at the second row) We're not in the first row?
Well, you know, if I uh, wasn't engaged.
Olive?
Oh, well, so what? Laughter - what is that? I mean, what is the point of opening your mouth and going "Ha, ha!"? What is that? "Ha, ha!"?
In any other shoe, I lose two inches. I - I can't have a drop down. We were eye to eye, I can't go eye to chin!
(Showing Jerry the menu) "Chef recommends"
(Talking it) Im here helpin you.
So what, they don?t have another plane? She couldn't take a bus?
(thinking she means the breasts) What!!
Kramer,
Oh thank you.
Wait, wait. Here me out. Don't dismiss this. You're very quick to dismiss. Don't dismiss. She's got a big crush on David Letterman, I mean, a big crush. She talks about him all the time. Suppose I go up to David Letterman. He works at NBC; I work at NBC. I explain my situation. He agrees to meet her. They go out, they fall madly in love. And she dumps me for David Letterman.
Of course it's cashemere.
Would you mind helping me out with some of this stuff?!?
So we pick up some (word missing)
Ah, would you take this picture away from me. Take it away and get it outta here. Let me just sign this and go.
You
Yeah. What time is it?
Of course not. I mean sure, there may have been one or two occasions in the past, when I may have reacted in uh impulsive or somewhat immature manner, but those days are well behind me.
(dials) Hi, are you OK? no, no,.. huh, (hangs up) She hung up.
A guy leaves a puddle of sweat, that's a signal?
Why should I?
Why them? Why not me?
It became very clear to me sitting out there today, that every decision I've ever made, in my entire life, has been wrong. My life is the complete opposite of everything I want it to be. Every instinct I have, in every of aspect of life, be it something to wear, something to eat ... It's all been wrong. (chuckles) Everywhere.
And this is Kramer.
Well that makes sense.
Oh, she's got the hue. So, what's going on with you and Melanie? I mean, I know you're not getting married, but uh, things are happening?
(hesitates) ...Nooooooooooo...
Just when I was doing great. I told you God wouldn't let me be successful.
This is a guy I know.. Kramer.
Until that stupid photo jogs his memory.
(breaks a long silence) The uh, the shoe laces that you bought me, they uh, they worked out well. (thumbs up)
Are you sure? Oh, look who I'm talking to. The president of NBC. (forced laughter)
Uh, my speech?
Could anybody do that?
Hey Elainie. What's going on?
Don't you believe me? It's their fiftieth anniversary. You know this is gonna kill him. You're aware of that. Kill him. On the biggest night of his life...
Exactly!
I dont understand, you never talk to her about other women?
I-I just don't react well to these situations. My grandmother died two months early because of the way I reacted in the hospital. She was getting' better. And then I went to pay her a visit. She saw my face. BOOM. That was the end of it.
How come we never hear him?
Yeah, that's exactly what I'm worried about. God would never let me be successful. He'd kill me first. He'd never let me be happy.
Ta _ mal _ e!
George is in big trouble....
Why is nice bad? What kind a of sick society we are living in, when nice is bad?
Well, who is she?
(as the others are repositioning the tables) No, no, you can't do that, they're round, it makes an 'eight' and, yeah, well alright.
But...somebody like Gail, though.
Ohh, I have tremendous respect for people who work with feet. I mean, to dedicate yourself to the foot - you're toiling in virtual anonymity. I mean..
Nothing, why? You think something's wrong? Am I different?
I've always liked her. Remember her in 'Carnal Knowledge'?
There's gotta be more to life than this. What gives you pleasure?
Alright, forget Elaine.
..That.
Well, lets just leave.
How'd you get that?
Well whad you buy it for?
He he he he
No.
Hey, there's a tomato stand, let's stop, I can get some more.
You know, about how when you break it down, it's really a very positive thing. you know, you have a nure, with a ma in front of it. MA-NURE. Iz not bad.
(to Kramer) Ah! You're just the man I'm looking for.
No no. That's not what I was trying to do.
George is going to the movies! (exits)
Really?
Yeah!, a doodle of me...look at the size of the nose , the ears, all my features are distorted.
No, I can't. She knows I go there. It's not secure. (the call waiting beeps) Hey, I got another call comin' in. I gotta let the machine get it. Bye. (hangs up)
Well, I can see that. What do you have to do that for? Who cares about your pants size?
I have tell you, I'm pretty impressed with the first one.
Is there any money involved?
You should have lied.
We're gonna hang around here a little while....something funny going on here
So countries just exchange gifts like that?
I... I... I long for you.
I usually spend Saturday afternoons with Susan. She's gonna want to know what I'm doing. I can't use Jerry, he's in Florida.
Sweetheart, I was exaggerating.
What's it gonna be?
(Yelling out to a waitress) Gonna need some water here!
You know what this has to do with?
Yes! I'm not giving him the satisfaction, it's my space.
Look, I gotta tell ya...I been thinkin' about it, I just don't feel right about letting you into Elaine's apartment.
(Watching the mechanic leave) I know about the vein! I cant believe this guy..
Yeah, yeah. Big advisor.
I'm Colin O'Brien.
Wha, that's a Kinney lot?
(Elaine walking down the hall they notice her and wave her into the room) Elaine! Get! (She enters)
Well...maybe not as much as this bastard... (points at Zeke, they all laugh) I can hold my own! (they all continue laughing and drinking)
(interested) Really?
I was jumping over a puddle, and for some reason I went like this. (George stretches out his arms in a ballet motion) And they called me a Mary. So I chased them, and I tripped and I fell.
Hey, Al. How's it going?
So, I'm uh, I'm afraid we're going to have to pass.
(harassed) Are you aware that I'm being charged for Tuesday's appointment? I had to take my mother to the chiropodist.
Jay Crespi, how am I gonna forget Jay Crespi?
And they say appearance is not important.
This prison stinks.
I gotta go.
Severance package...The Yankees are giving me three months full pay for doing nothing.
You are?
(annoyed) Good for the tuna.
(Smiling to himself) You don't have to worry about me. (Nodding, gloating) I won a contest.
You're considering hiring me for your latex salesman.
With me or in general?
Hey.
We're slowing down. Are those the people?
Laura, sure.
Hey/Hi/Hello (etc.)
She said first row! Right behind the dugout!
Please.
No, no, no, see you're not really listening.
Okay, what are we gonna do?
This is a crude mock-up of the conference room. 1/14th scale.
Yeah. One second sweetheart. Jerry, I really think it'd be easier if you didn't tuck.
(well, obviously) Yes.
She's not gonna like it.
And the Christian rock?
I knew it!! (shuts cab door) I predicted it! (hits cab roof twice, it drives off) Saw both of them today! What a disaster! I'm runnin' all over Queens. First I saw my mother. We had lunch together. Never had... LUNCH with my mother before--it's like a date! Then we drive down to Kew Gardens! Tons of traffic! I see my father. We played "Clue"! All day with this! [Kew Gardens (see links at end of script)]
She had a dude?
(Puts his hands on his face, rubbing his eyes) Look. It's a skill, just like juggling. She probably enjoys showing it off.
I'm losin' it!
Well, I can't walk anywhere now. I'm just gonna be wishing there were walkways. (seeing Elaine removing her shoe) What are you doing?
Behind the dugout, that's where we were sitting the other day.
Hey!
Jerry, just remember. It's not a lie... if you believe it.
Yeah.
Yeah, sure.
Chinese food?
Vivian!!
What do I do?! What do I do?!
(Unconvincingly coy) About what?
(more excitement) You were gonna fix me up with her?
(passes cane from right to left and back a few times) But, see here. Right. Wrong. Right. Wrong. Right. Right. Wrong--
How you doing?
Know what? Ponce De Leon is sold out.
Okay. "Breakfast At Tiffany's." (Begins to read, but gradually his attention is drawn to the TV Guide on the end table. George realizes there's a show on he wants to see by looking at his watch, and doesn't start the book.)
Your wake up guy asked you out?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's it. More of that, difficult. I'm a difficult seed.
Do I really have to buy her something?
Oh, I don't know.
I, uh, should have a poem very soon now.
That's the sign! The test; if a - if a man makes it move.
uh, Uh, Vandelay Industries, is uh. 129 West 81st street. It's a very small industry Vandelay. It's one of the reasons I wanted to uh, work for them.
No, no no it's not about postponing. I just think the first day of Spring is the perfect day to get married. You know, Spring! Rejuvenation! Rebirth! Everything is blooming all the
(taking it out of his jacket pocket) yeah I got some sandwiches.. I got tuna.. and salmon salad Tony because I know you don't like peanut butter
It's a little unusual. So, uh, Susan and I were thinking, uh, dinner at our house Saturday night. Just the four of us.
Hey, Lloyd. (Shakes hands with Lloyd) How's it going? (chuckles)
I got a hotel room.
(looking at his watch) I really should get going. Y'know, I..I wanna be home in case Neil calls.
The way they make 'em these days, I'll never have to tell her.
Uh, good. You know, you might wanna try eating it with one of these. (Holds up lobster bib)
I can't believe you're not playing in cotton.
What? No dibs! I need this statue. Cmon, give it!
We've just been through this! You don't remember? We just had this exact same conversation a minute ago!
Yea, she likes you.
What?
Hey! Saturday night!
Rosses.
Si, por favor.
Oh, pretty good.
Uh, nothing. I got to go.
Well, we were engaged to be married, uh, we bought the wedding invitations, and, uh, yada yada yada, I'm still single.
No. Just imagine her reaction.
April.
I did?
Oh, please. (to the teller) Can you change this into bills?
Really?
What'd he tell you?
Well, what'd you think?
Who?
She's been locked up for two years. She's gonna want to make up for lost time. Dinners. Movies. (Rubs his forehead.) Talking...
Well, does he wear bland, drab, olive colored clothing?
I'll tell you what happened. I bet he got the AM/PM mixed-up.
The guy who pitched him the show with the stories about nothing. (snaps fingers) Jerry Seinfeld. Jerry Seinfeld's friend.
Hey.
So, whaddya say? You know you'll always be the only man I'll ever love.
I don't want him to!
Hum..( to Elaine) Hey! did you talk to Paula?
Yeah. She should be commending me for treating everyone like equals.
Hello.
Interesting.
Kramer...
Come here.
(CONT'D) Excuse me...I really... What's happened is that my friend forgot where he parked and if you're not in a big hurry, we'd really appreciate it if...
What the hell.
Nope.
He wants to talk about "Jerry"?
Fantastic!
Judgement, Jerry, judgement! You exercised no judgement.
That was a hell of a thing when Spock died...
I thought he was just gonna have a muffin.
I like to get the Daily News!
Oh, get outta here.
You, uh, you like baseball? [picks up baseball from desk]
You're not really gonna go to California, are you?
Yes, a rosy glow.
You should see what my father used to go through before he bought a car. He'd go from state to state. He was away for weeks at a time. It was like he was running for President and he was going through the primaries. We'd get phone calls from motels in New Hampshire.
Yes?
I love the mirror in that bathroom! I dont know what in the hell it is. I look terrific in that mirror. (George sits.) I dont know if its the tile or the lighting... I feel like Robert Wagner.
What? He's outside?
All right (he smiles weakly at Maura)
Well, it's the damnedest thing. The cat dies. So she comes back into town, she finds the cat lying on the carpet stiff as a board.
No. Autonomy, complete and total autonomy.
Hello? I can take an hour off your hands. Give the kids a chance to see a real live Yankee.
Did she show her breasts in that?
I got to give the players most of the credit for that.
Oh, no no no. I was just looking for stock-pages. Here it is. Looking for the quotes. Gotta check to quotes. Love a good quote. Oh, IBM up a quarter.
Of Course I'm telling the truth.
Happy Festivus!
Hate those couples. I could never bee one of those couples. There are no bald woman around. You know?
(trying to laugh it off) No, I was just wondering. The information could be relevant.
Would you stop it. (Susan playfully bites his ear lobe again) Would you quit it please. Someone is going to see us here.
It's not real. They're all made up.
I leave you alone for two seconds, and this is what you do! I trusted you!
What are those?
Wait a minute, she did a skin cancer screening at Peterman?
I just remembered, th-th-there's this Chinese restaurant out near Yankee Stadium, that puts flyers on all the cars.
I don't believe it, what did you say?
(Asking Elaine) Jerry seem a little weird when I mentioned Nina?
(to the woman) Boy, I have to get to a bathroom.
They gave me the Pensky file.
Maybe he was going to say "Of course I have to check with my associates."
No. No T-bone.
...but is there any way that I could possibly have Neil's phone number?
So I lugged that table. That big heavy massage table all the way down to the cab! You ever seen one of those things?
What about this--
I, I can't believe this is happening!
I don't think we should see each other anymore. You're great but I'm I'm riddled with personal problems.
Hey, he,
C'mon Jerry, please! It won't happen again.
All right, so what did they do?
Early! Alright! (shivers.) Cold.
So you're against me now?
Oh. Ha. They are my keys, how weird. (laughs)
Allright, very good I'd like my car and my deposit back please
Sure. You know, Rhisa. I've always found you... very attractive.
Are you sure?
What?
Oh, no, no. Twix is the only candy with the cookie crunch.
I can't believe this! What was wrong with it? What didn't you like about it?
I have never seen a Mohel like that.
Krama. Please.
Siege mentality, Jerry. They really want me out of here. Theyve downgraded me to some sort of a bunker. Im like Hitlers last days here.
Oh. You still wanna go?
I mean, they're retired.
(Stuttering) I, I, I, .. here, let me - let me help you..
Plenty of mosquitoes.
Oh no no no, they don't want to join us.
Ohhhhhh
Girlfriend, yeah, right.
Yeah, it's me sir. It's been a harrowing few days. uuh,After the car accident, I-I crawled into a ditch, and managed to survive on, grubs and puddle water, until a kindly old gentleman picked me up.
No, no, I don't think I'm special. My mother always said I'm not special.
Maybe she's diabetic.
Ow. My eye, my eye.
Hey, did you see that whale thing on TV last night?
No, you didnt!
I don't know her.
Parole! (Feigning joy) That's dynamite!
Yes, I am familiar with this syndrome -- she's a two-face.
Well, it happened again.
Isn't that that Bania guy?
yes?
(shamefaced) No.
Is-is that what I said 'no story'? Because Jerry had to tell me later.
Well, I was wondering...
(Sarcastic) Maybe for her new performance piece she'll give birth on stage.
People who do that should be arrested.
Nothing except Prognosis Negative.
Me too.
Where are you!
I have to talk to Elaine. This cleaing lady is turning the screws on me. She's pushing for this whole relationship thing. She keeps calling me, threatening to go to the boss with this thing, I could lose my job, I gotta do something to keep her quiet.
(claps all happy) AH! (half hugs Estelle)
Do you uh feel the way you feel after the Risotto?
Yes!
Birthday card?
What was that?
I'm wearing some cologne, all right?
Excuse me, the guy is wearing a jacket that my friend is...
Oh, man, it's spinach! I've been walking around like this all afternoon.
Well, you know, I shouldn't have let you into Kramer's, now you want to go into Elaine's...she entrusted me with her spare keys, how can I just let you in?
What?
Just a little something for Christmas.
Well it's not fair, Jerry. It's just not fair. All right, all right. That's it. I'm getting out of this thing.
I went to the hardware store interview.
What time is it?
I like (imitates Kramer) "cookies."
Nope! (Starts heading for the door)
Oh...pretty good.
Yes. You know the uh flood, and the uh lepers, and the commandments and all that.
Your parents are going to Paris right?
It's George.
He knows the worlds theory.
What is that? Its ridiculous! You dont even know what hotel shes staying at, you cant call her. Thats a signal, Jerry, thats a signal! (snaps his fingers) Signal!
No.
nothing
Um, all right, um, uh, I'll call 'ya. I'll call you and we'll talk on the phone. A telephone communiqu. Every thing is fine ok, uh, fine, .. [exits]
Please, this is very, very important.
He's an importer.
So?
(frustrated) Ohh, I wanted to see that. (waves his arms in frustration) Thanks. Thanks a lot.
So what? Somebody dropped an egg on my head as I went into my building last night.
Yeah.
Oh, Tara!
I havent seen him for months.
I can't tell ya now , he's gonna be back in a ten seconds.
How do you feel? Confident?
Unless she goes for the bathroom. Thats my only chance. (George crumbles. He drops the cassette on the table.) Who am I kidding? I cant do this, I cant do this. I dont even know how to work those stupid machines.
What're.. What're you talking about?
please please I don't want to die up here. please, stop moving that's all I'm asking.. Kramer!!
What?
(opening door to leave) He picked her up?
Id like to help, but my neck..
Yeah, (Smiling) Susan said you'd be excited.
What about the dolphins? You could swim with the dolphins down there.
Again with the checked out. I'm not going to the doctor. If I don't to the doctor, then nothing will happen to me. If I go he might find something.
I can't drive?
Elaine, Julie.
tsh (snorts) Ah, yeah, we've - we've talked . . . I believe I can speak for the both of us on this.
I was trying to loosen 'em up a little bit.
Cleaning them out.
So what do you care what she thinks.
(talking from bathroom) Witness?
Oh, thank you.
You see those tears streaming down you don't know what to do. It was like she was on fire and I was trying to put her out.
Ha Haaaaaaa... Jerry how do you like that.You see I get myself in a dizzy, I'm all worked up and for what?
You're parents saw me on TV?
We're not dead.
(Standing up, still waking up) Alright, you know what we should do? We should go to the movies. Get away from this script for a while..
No no no no no no no..
You didn't make it clear.
How 'ya feelin'?
All you got is instant coffee? Why don't you get some real coffee?
You said the guy gave you an open-lipped kiss!
Oh, Schumann. Of course.
What's that?
"Hemmm!.. Fine!"
No you wouldn't. Nobody would. It's just that... they were missing, and... well I'm just inquiring. (chuckles nervously)
'Just listen to the music of the traffic, in the city. Linger on the sidewalk, where the neon lights are pretty.' Where the neon lights are pretty. The Broadway area?
Yeah! Right!
That was an honest mistake.
"To the victor goes the spoils." What are you going to do tonight?
I'm "Pappy".
You would think that at the end of the week when they hand out the checks, throw in a few soaps.
No, no, pff...
Gotta tell you I'm pretty comfortable.
So, check out my view.
I don't want Morgan's job. He's got a lot of work to do. Hey, Elaine, your friend never woke up Mr. Morgan.
A-hu no, uh, it's just that ...
"Well...there's no room for someone like that in this organization."
In college, maybe. Those were fun times.
No, no, what, what?
I thought Mulva hated you.
How many people does he do that for?
Kissing is sex.
Well, it always has to be explained to me, and then I have to have someone explain the explanation.
Pass the salt please.
This'll only take a second.
I don't know.
I know, I know and you know *why* they're moving there?
Come on, how hard is that? Look at all the junk that's on TV. You want an idea? Here's an idea. You coach gymnastics team in high school. And you're married. And your son's not interested in gymnastics and you're pushing him into gymnastics.
Maybe it was a mouse.
Pardon me, I went to see your friend Dwayne... there was no discount.
They're making their decision today.
What's that?
No, we're not. We're not men.
(Daring) You think you could?
Please. Give me another chance.
Well, if it's as good as ``Ponce de Leon'', I'll be happy.
You went for the big "E".
So you don't speak *any* English at all?
Alright ok. You got the tape?
See, It's not so hard.
Mmm, no. Boy, it really didn't come out too well, did it?
And she didn't say something to you about a certain something?
Yeah...
Something's going on here.
(???), we'll see you in a little while.
Oh I beg to differ. My father took great pride in his appearance, he was a very handsome man, a casanova really.
See ya later.
Hey, now you're onto something.
It's like some pod landed from another planet and took your body. Don't fall asleep Elaine.
Stinks.
What the hell is this? George, Elaine and I went to see Chunnel ... with Jerry. With Jerry, huh? With Jerry! Great. Great! (dials phone) Probably went to the 84th St. That's where I always go with Jerry.
We sat there for twenty minutes, chewing, staring at each other in a defunct relationship.
This is not good. World's are colliding! George is getting upset!
Wait a second. (smells it). all right.
Hey Joey, how you doin'?
So, you live with your mother, huh?
Yeah, my cleaning lady's Portuguese. I must've picked it up.
I quit my job.
Where are you goin?
I got to tell you I felt terrible. I really thought she was going to collapse and kill herself.
What is Pericles?
Oh, gotta get fifty. Gotta get fifty. All right, I tell you what. We go to the coffee shop, you call your manager. Maybe they made an offer.
Yeah.
Well, you're not gonna believe what happened.
Yeah, he once bumped into reverend Yung Sun Moon.
Hey. Check these out. I just picked them up from Sheila. She must have loved these.
They can...
Yeah, go ahead, call.
I know enough to stay away from it.
I don't know.
Well, I didn't want to break our date.
Why don't you give me the twenty, and I'll stop and get change, and then you and I can... uh... you-know, settle.
That's Kramer.
Deena! Deena, wait a... Deena, help!
I need everything in there.
No, I froze.
Like that?
Yeah.
Ok, what did you say?
(quietly) ahh.
I can't carry any changes in these pants, it falls out.
Ho ho. This bizarre ?harrod? experiment must end!
He's an importer-exporter.
Hes an importer.
(to Kramer) It's a funeral procession. . . . (to Elaine) And I got news for you. I show up with Ring Dings and Pepsi, I become the biggest hit of the party. People be coming up to me, "just between you and me I'm really excited about the Ring Dings and the Pepsi. What are we, Europeans with the Beaujolais and Chardonnay . . .
Madam? What are you calling me madam for?
The psychic said something terrible will happen.
English. Does anybody speak English .Nobody speaks English.
What are ya doing?! Whadya, crazy?!
They'll call back.
A different name for the butler? (Russell throws up again.)
I know.
Maybe she just wants to talk to me?
She treated me to the Arabian mocha java.
(coming back to the table from the bathroom) Oh uh. You ready?
Bender? He cant play left. He stinks. I just dont see what purpose is it gonna serve your going? I mean, you think dead peole care whos at their funeral? They dont even know theyre having a funeral. Its not like shes hanging out in the back going, I cant believe Jerry didnt show up.
Ben Cantwell. 85. Huh... You think we'll make it to that age?
We gotta get something. I don't want to go to that meeting on an empty stomach. Let's get some Chinese. You wanna order it?
He's giving you furniture? Who is this guy?
So... here I am. Ready to take you to the Hamptons.
It seems like a problem.
Oh, this is great.
(Whispering to Jerry) What time is our flight back? I got to go to the bathroom.
(frantic) Oh, Jerry Jerry Jerry Jerry Jerry, listen, if, if you are feeling uncomfortable about this at all, at all. Do not feel like you have to take it.
Youre a fine person. Youre a humanitarian. Shes very sexy.
Like if she wants to know if I'm pleased with something, she'll say, "Happy, Pappy?"
"George is getting upset.."
Oh, oh!
All right. At last, we're finally gettin' out of here.
Oh yeah?
What do you tip a chamber maid.
Why not? It's a good look for a woman.
All right, he's letting you in. Thank you! Creep.
Why not?
Oh, yes, yes, yes. Very, very hard.
Of course, I'm the result of my parents having stayed together, so you never know. (Russell comes out of the bathroom.)
What if I'm at the bottom?
How much money d'you think they have?
Hi, Carol.
I can't believe it. He's going! He's fired!
No, she's taking this course in education for her masters. It's part of her research project, so I have to be a guinea pig.
Hello?
What's the deal with Aquaman? Could he go on land, or was he just restricted to water?
Um, excuse me, I think you forgot my bread.
Im starving. You got any of those free donuts you use to soften people up?
About a year ago. Wedding invitations.
Oh I think I'd go for the back.
(worried) Oh boy.
That's okay. That's good. You think Louie Pasteur and his wife had anything in common? He was in the fields all day with the cows, you know with the milk, examining the milk, delving into milk, consummed with milk. Pasteurization, Homogenization, She was in the kitchen killing cockroaches with a boot on each hand.
Apparently the Seinfelds' are too good for us. I shouldn't say anything bad about your uh your partner.
Ah, a, You know what, maybe I'll just come ... umm, yummm (stammering)
(seeing his parents being intimate) Oh, my god!
You know, I used to love Paris. My uh, dead Fiance, Susan.. (opening wallet) In fact I. think I, I may have a picture of her..
Will you marry me?
All right. That's enough for today. You're tired. Get some sleep. I'll see you first thing in the morning.
Who's that?
Cheryl, Elaine, and uh, Jerry.
(Studying the salt shaker) I'm not taking a civil service test.
Yeah, I know what happened.
Nah, I guess I should really get moving on this, huh? I'm gonna go. (Opens the door, letting Newman in. Leaves)
It's George
Jerry, would you do me a favor, close the window.
Well, I was very comfortable! I've got my nuts here...
No harm!
No, no...I hate the condom.
Hey, uh...
You, uh, didn't dance again, did you?
Jerry. Marla. (Realizing Jerry's cue) Stacey! (Walks over to Stacey)
I-I wasn't in the attic.
My card won't work there; they're not on the Plus system.
Sid, it's completely his fault.
What's the matter with your leg?
(shouting) Dee... Deena!
Hey. Where is everyone?
Jerry, let's face it, I've always been handicapped. I'm just now getting the recognition for it. Name one thing I have that puts me in a position of advantage. Huh? There was a guy that worked at the Yankees-- no arms! He got more work done than I did, made more money, had a wife, a family, drove a better car than I did.
He's beboppin' and scattin', and I'm losin' it!
I could go bumper to bumper with any one else on this planet!
Yeah, so?
What?
(eager) So? What d'you think?
Well, anyway, the book club meets tomorrow, Mr. Temple.
20 bucks? Isn't that excessive?
(starts to try to get passed Jerry and Elaine) Alright get out of my way. (Jerry and Elaine push him back, George very annoyed) Alright don't make me get physical here!
Right.
(waving Eva.
Yeah, well I uh got lots of other stuff to show you too. Wait till you see the plum job that I landed.
Jerry! (Slams the door) Georgie's moving out!
(jokingly) Well, so, legally, I could marry your daughter.
My father had a car salesman buddy. He was gonna fix him up real nice. Next thing I know, Im gettin dropped of in a Le Car with a fabric sunroof. All the kids are shoutin at me, "Hey, Le George! Bonjour, Le George! Lets stuff Le George in Le Locker!"
Mister Fowler, I-I have a squirrel here that is a miracle of modern science! (laughs)
How many days was it between encounters.
So, you... you say you've been in the city all winter?
Clothes shopping.
Shes an... etymologist. You know, bees, flies, gnats. W-What about you?
What's casus belli.
Really?
So what's in it for the mentor?
Pudding skin singles.
Ah, listen ah, I don't mean to bother you but ah, silly me, I- I think I may have left my hat in your apartment. So ah, I thought I'd just come by later and pick it up.
Screw the Drake!
(to Jerry) "You know those shoes that Jimmy had? I cut a deal with him. We're gonna import a case of them together."
Maybe they forgot to put it out!
(calling after her) But..
I love that bathroom. It's got that high, high toilet. I feel like a gargoyle perched on the ledge of a building.
Yeah, I feel like I've grown.
(shouts) You be nice!
Carl... Yeah, he was a nice guy.
Food was good.
(puts down handset) Because he'll know I told you. Besides, he's giving me a parking spot around the corner for practically nothing.
Peter, Paul and Mary.
You think this is the plane that Ted Danson gets?
Never mind.
You can't do that, you can't just sneak in from the back like that.
Yeah, I grabbed it on the way out, I don't want my mother reading it.
"Plyometric?"
What about a letter?
What? Did I what?
You don't?
(disappointed) Oww.
(glances in mirror) Alright. Alright.
A little breakfast.
Uh-huh. And how much does the healer charge?
Who are they?
Jose Jimenez, ... verrry funny. ..very funny.
So you could call a woman for a date, ask her if she's free for Dinner and a flamenco?
(PULLING OUT ESTIMATE OUT OF HIS POCKET) Well, profit. I think you'll see from the estimate that I'm not really profiting that much. They might be a little high, but..
You don't want to suffer with this all weekend.
Oh, those, those aren't my keys.
Yeah.
Big screen TV?
(taken aback) The actress?
I have a fear of intimacy
Why don't you ever go shopping?
Chamomile's good. Lemon Lift. Almond Pleasure.
What a fascinating turn of events. (Waitress approaches)
Talk to him!
What I don't get is, just because the battery is dead, you think she'd be able to roll up the hill with her hands!
Flip it.
So what happened?
Yeah, follow-up question, that'll work.
What??
?? get away??
You should be the one criticizing me. I, I'm lucky to even know someone like you.
Ah, you still going on in front of Bania, eh?
I don't even know her sister but believe me, if she's getting traffic tickets, she's not that good-looking! Woah
Sorry.
There's no chance of that.
Marisa Tomei! I, just spoke to Marisa Tomei! (sitting opposite Elaine) And I wasn't even that nervous.
Hey, by the way, what'd you think of Miss Yoshimura?
You have no idea how refreshing that is.
Oh yeah! Middle finger, straight up, at me! At us!
"....I like spicy chicken"
That's not funny. So, are you coming to the party?
Did you happen to notice that Julie handed the big salad to Elaine?
(worried) Alright, alright. Look, we're people, you and me, huh? Businessmen. Colleagues, if I may. Let's not quibble. We'll do it for the thirteen thousand. Thirteen thousand, and I never came up here, we never talked, alright. You take good care. (moving past Russell toward the door) It was nice seeing you again, and nice meeting you. (to Cynthia) Cynthia, right?
I think I saw him. I think it's him.
So, let me ask you. Do you think I could have done this?
They *left* the Junior Mint *in* him?
Yeah, yeah.
(puzzled) I bought it. (enters lobby)
I'm not following.
Let Maria Shriver give her a baby shower.
This is what they would do in the movies! It's a beautiful thing! It's like a movie! I'm gonna slip him a mickey!
(Once again, still on the shower) Could it be lukewarm?
How can I take it?
I was all primed for the first row; I was gonna put my feet up on the dugout!
This is amazing. (George gets up to leave and shake's man's hand) Thank you. Thank you very much. . . . I'm going back in! . . . You'll feel better (to woman)
Fine, I'll make an appointment. (He leaves)
Well good, good. Take it off you're going to wear it out already. It's for special occasions this thing.
Oh, yeah?
Coco?
I cant do it. Ill, Ill keep her busy.
So, Im thinking, as shes saying this, Im thinking great, the relationships over. But the egg salads on the way. So now I have a decision Do I walk or do I eat?
It's Mickey Mantle, Jerry. My idol.
Sorry we're late.
Elaine? (she turns, sighing) Can I come?
No...Why should that make any difference to you?
All right, stop it! Stay away from my breasts! Chest!
well humm.. lets get some coffee.
Yeah? How?
(Annoyingly butting in) Kinda like Superman's fortress of solitude.
You're so uptight.
(removing his glasses) You know, Hawaii could be a little tricky right now, there's a lot of high pressure winds down there this time of year, there's a lot of debris constantly flying around. Wood, and uh, lava, pretty dangerous.
Why would I...
Yeah, and she's going to find I'm a moron. You know, people think I'm smart, but I'm not smart.
What about the skin? I need a good cheek, I like a good cheek.
Yea
Ill meet her outside the building.
(Breathing deeply) That's very dirty. (Jerry nods) That's absolutely filthy.
Elaine, of course I'm concerned. I'm payin' for those meals. It's like throwing money down the toilet.
There was a woman, Audrey. She had a very big nose.
You know Keith, what I've always wondered, with all these ball clubs flying around all season don't you think there would be a plane crash? ...
There's an easy move go from screwin' you behind your back to screwin' you right to your face.
Walked around? And you looked?
She um, she wants to see The Muted Heart.
What did we say? Two seventy-five?
I can't tell you, don't ask.
Sorry I'm late.
This. Just talking.
And now?
(opening door) It's a big night. I'm, uh, ice skating with one, and going to a staged reading of "Godspell" with the other.
All right. Let's get to work.
He did that?
No, you're not a divorcee. Youre just separated. You're---you're a separatee.
Well, it's a good looking piece of meat. (laughs nervously) Wow, this is some place. A duplex, huh? (indicating) Look at this, you got stairs in an apartment. All my life, I dreamed about having steps in an apartment. Even one step. Sunken living room. Although, one step is really not all that sunken. (tries hard to elicit a laugh)
That took awhile.
So? Where are we going?
Ha, I don't know who she's looking for. I don't know. I'll tell you something. She's very particular, your daughter. Very particular. What is she looking for some big hot shot businessman? Well I've got my pride too. I'm not going to beg her.
(interrupting) You know we should really order, the service is so slow here, by the time you get anything...
The Friars Club?
You think she could be an 'it'? Could she be an 'it'?
Aw, she's gonna be a fine sailor.
So, I ran into the Rosses again.
Sure, sure, sure, sure. (patting Jerry on the shoulders) How about these seats? Are these fantastic, huh? Huh? I feel like Lincoln.
No, no, she might just think its a gift.
No, it isn't.
Why does everything have to be 'us'? Is there no 'me' left? Why can't there be some things just for me? Is that so selfish?
Hey, shut up.
I'm bored. She's boring, I'm boring, we're both boring. We got out to eat, we both read newspapers.
Alright, start looking for spaces.
All Simons was able to find out is that hes in the hospital.
(TALKING IN PASSENGER WINDOW) I didn't mean anything by it. I don't even know L. Ron Hubbard! I didn't know you were...
So uh where we eating?
(worked up) I'm aware! I'm aware!! But this is Marisa Tomei, Elaine. An Oscar winner! How can I live the rest of my life, knowing I coulda been with Marisa Tomei? She said I was just her type! She loves short, stocky, balding funny men!
$3.49? It says $1.49.
Ewings hurt? How long is he going to be out?
You don't remember me?
Oh yeah, you were right. She's gorgeous.
I tell you this. If the real Phil Rizzuto was down there, this wouldn't be happening!
I got your calzones Mr. Steinbrenner.
Ow! Dad...
Never happened.
...and, and maybe shell see me when she gets there, does this woman intend to spend time with me?
Head start, oh no absolutely not.
Then I see my clothes floating out there. The tied took them out, not the kids.
Why not? Pay is good. I got dental, private access to one of the great handicapped toilets in the city.
Oh, yeah. I read what you said to the papers yesterday. You weren't in on the planing. What planning? YOU THINK WE PLANED THIS? Uh?
I mean it's hard enough to meet a woman you dislike, much less like.
You know, I cant believe youre bringin in an extra bed for woman that wants to sleep with you. Why dont you bring in an extra guy too?
Same thing!
No, you can have it.
A bubble boy?
She knew I didnt have a job, she knew I lived at home. Didnt seem to bother her. I think I could have married this woman.
Yeah, yeah. Shes punctual... and uh shes been late, sometimes.
So you're buying the car back for your parents?
Well, there's going to be a lot of dentists there.
Everybody's talkin' at me...I can't hear a word they're sayin'...just drivin' around in Jon Voight's car...
I was sitting there, c'mon.
Why?
What, you mean you know about this?
Who invaded Spain in the Eighth Century?
..Oh boy.
I can't do this! I can't do it. I have tried. I'm here. It's impossible.
Oh, my God...
No.
Susan, wait please... (grabs her) Please ...
We're not stealing it.
Yeah, yeah. You must have squirted a piece of pulp in it too.
Ok uh, I guess I'll tell them that.
Yes. Why, is that so inconceivable?
(smiling) Well, we're certainly glad that you could make it.
(shocked) When do I start?
MOOPS
So, they didn't give you a piece of cake? Big deal.
Laguardia? All right, let's go. C'mon...
Anyway, we met with NBC about a month ago and they gave us the green light to go ahead and write a pilot. In fact, we got a big meeting with them tomorrow. They gotta approve of the story before we can write.
Tonight's the night, right? Prognosis Negative?
Yeah, but you know where it is.
Carrie, could you do me a favour? Could you not mention this to your mother?
He didn't get better, did he?
Demi (the "i" sounds like an "e")? I thought it was Demi?
Popcorn?
Alright, well why don't we smooth the head down to nothing, stick a pumpkin under its arm and change the nameplate to Ichabod Crane?
"The phone's a piece of junk, goodbye"!
How did you know that?
She doesn't.
Yeah. I can't get over it.
What are you, Bud Abbott? What are you callin me an idiot?
You miss her.
Well, she didn't BUY the big salad. I bought the big salad.
(anticipating the answer) Not.
What? Now, you listen to me!
All right. Kramer, you block off traffic. You to go sweet-talk the pharmacist.
Finished.
What about this weekend?
Hate the Drake.
I'm family. I'm having sex with the cousin!
You told David Putty your move and you didn't tell *me*? I *need* a move. You know I have no moves, Jerry. (points to the candy bar) Gimme a bite.
I'm getting a makeover.
(Pleading) You gotta let me go over there.
I like Mike Lubika.
I dont know what the hell I said. I gave her an ultimatum and theres nothing I can do. Its a machine. The little light is blinking right now, Come and listen to the idiot. Hey everybody, the idiots on!
I don't know, what do women say?
It's really nothing, it's like going to the dentist.
Better than before?
Hey Alec
Because I cant call a woman with other people in the room. Come on, lets go.
They got a new intern from Francis Louis High. His name is Keith. He comes in Mondays after school.
You can see the Cayman Islands in there? Is something going to happen to me? What?
Well, I gotta do somethin'. (Walks over to bathroom. Kramer enters)
Did you see that? That-that pigeon didn't move! I had to swerve to get out of the way! I saved that pigeons life!
(happily) Difficult?
George, George Costanza!
You can't - huhu, All right let's go.
No reason!
Hehehehehe (higher tone laugh, though still quietly )
I know, I know, thats what they said.
Yo.
Y'know, I'm better with the mothers than I am with the daughters.
Nope, no can do.
What if we grew muttonchops?
I think I could be a philanthropist. a kick ass philanthropist! I would have all this money, and people would love me. Then they would come to me.. and beg! And if I felt like it, I would help them out. And then they would owe me big time! (Thinking to himself) .. First thing I'm gonna need is a driver..
(leaving the european accent) No. (laughs)
(humble) Well, if you must know, shhhe, was my fiance, Susan. May she rest in peace.
" I'll always be a winner and you'll always be a loser." This is what he said to me.
Haha (laughs)
Yeah, see, uh, when we met, I was over there and, uh, you were over here, so the image, uh, the image was reversed, like, uh, like in the mirror.
"No I didn't"
I solve problems. That's just what I do.
(triumph) Alright.
Besides, what's it gonna cost me? Thirty-eight bucks?
Guess not.
[furious] Good. It's good to be accurate like that.
Nothing.
Hide, hide under the desk.
I know. Completely bonkers!
"The hell with them?"
And I am not a piece of toast.
How do you know?
Hey...you don't think...sure, that's Jon Voight's pencil!
Men have been popping into my sexual fantasies. All of a sudden I'll be, in the middle.
Woo! Some day out there - You ever see weather like that? Woo! It's crisp - it's crispy crisp.
It's my space!
Maybe she could like me? Is it that far fetched? Maybe she sees something? Is it possible?
You're Murphy!! Look, let's just jump out of the car.
(Stingy) Its wrinkled. Its worthless.
OK Look, the gum isn't cutting it for me. We need to be about something else...anything..please.
This is incredible! This is one of the greatest things I've ever done in my life! I'm gonna call my mother.
It's in the vault?
Hey.
Did you ever read anything by him?
Well, I didn't mean to hurt you kid.
(to Jerry, yelling) You told her? She's not your wife!
Oh, you know what you're like? You're like a pathetic gambler. You're one of those losers in Las Vegas who keeps thinking he's gonna come up with a way to win at blackjack.
So we started drinking, and I'll tell you I don't know if it was the alcohol or the ammonia, but the next think I knew she was mopping the floor with me.
Why? That's a *legitimate* sociological question.
No!
Coulda fixed me up with Marisa Tomei. She said I was just her type!
What did you do?
Oh of course you can use it, sure. (Jerry saying stuff through the phone) Ok, bye. (hangs the phone up)
Oh, very refreshing. (Thinking again) Sex is like joining a private club. I'll be the same me tomorrow, but suddenly, the no trespassing sign will be gone.
What side?
I'll call a plumber right now! (Goes for the phone.)
(looks back to the group) I can read lips. You said let's sleep together.
(pause) Are you?
We'd have to kill him.
How ya doing?
I confused it with another awning.
Ah! See? I told ya.
Didn't they notice it?
(examining reflection) I really think this looks pretty good.
But tell him to give me the--
Uh, no, I'm not.
Above the rim.
Twix.. (Makes various noises) B-5.
That's a lot of pressure. Make love to me. What am I, in the circus? What if I can't deliver?
I don't want any mango.
Hey, did you know that the Yankees don't wear cotton jerseys?
So, how come nothing ever happened between you and Nina? (Getting paranoid) Is there a problem with her? Is she a man?
Aaaaaah
I know less about women than anyone in the world. But one thing I do know is they're not happy if you don't spend the night. It could be a hot, sweaty room with no air conditioning and all they have is a little army cot this wide (Displays with French fry) You're not going anywhere.
How's that Tony?
What do you mean Wednesday? I though we had tickets to the Knick game Wednesday. We got seats behind the bench! What happened? Were not going?
(pause) Uh-oh.
(somewhat annoyed) I suppose you could be an architect.
Two no-tucks.
Well what if I told you I'm thinking of moving here?
Kramer, I can't help you. You're gonna have to get them some place else.
Now I remember, as I jumped over the hole I heard a, like a jingling sound.
(Relieved) I haven't? I'm okay? I'm okay? Oh, thank you, thank you, Doctor! I don't know how to thank you.
Why not?
Jerk!
