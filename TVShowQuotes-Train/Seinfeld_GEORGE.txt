He's right! It's the same thing with the femenists. You know, they want everything to be equal, everything! But when the check comes, where are they?
Ho, ho, ho! Hes got a live one. Hes just reeling his big fish in!
I figured you'd cruise. At least through the Spring.
Hu-Yeah, interest. It's an amazing thing. You make money without doing anything...
I bawled uncontrollably. I just poured my guts out. And I'll tell you, Jerry, it was incredible. I never realized how powerful these tears are. I could have postponed it another five years if I wanted to.
I wasn't going to say anything, but then I could see that he wasn't going to open his mouth. (Chuckles)
That's like using a wheelchair for the fun of it!
Well, they're more than an underwear to me Mr. Farkus. Two cups in the front, two loops in the back. How do they do it?
What are you talking about.. I WANT MY CAR!!
It's an inter-office envelope. It get passed around all over the office.
Really, I was, I was only kidding around.
(trying to laugh it off) No, I was just wondering. The information could be relevant.
I know Jerry. He has this phobia about public toilets. I think we really should go upstairs.
Oh, this guy tried to sneak into my space.
"Hey listen, let me give you my card. It's got my home number on it. I want to buy the first pair when the next shipment comes in."
No I can't. I can't die with dignity. I have no dignity. I want to be the one person who doesn't die with dignity. I live my whole life in shame. Why should I die with dignity?
All right. (tearing his jacket off) Let me just say one thing there is no way that this is gonna happen. You hear me? No Way! Because if you think I'm going' to two Thanksgivings, you're out of your mind!!!
I can't eat this without catsup. Would it kill her to check up on us? Would that be a terrible thing? "How's everything? Do you need anything? What can I do for you?"
Well, if it's as good as ``Ponce de Leon'', I'll be happy.
Mon...? No, no, I can't wait til Monday, that's impossible, I gotta talk to him now. Where does he live?
Yeah, this is my first time here. (nudges Jerry again)
I banged it on the desk in the doctor's office. An (worriedly rubbing his arm) aaaa . . .
(gets up to leave the table) HELLO!!! (angrily)
Dont you think you get more without it?
Oh, sure. Sure, anything. Can you believe it? There's nothing wrong with me.
La-la Land. I got the window seat, right?
Whatever. Believe me, if I wasn't involved right now, I wouldn't mind being set up. Something tells me she's a knockout. (we see, from the camera inside the cab, George's hand waving as the cab drives away)
(surprise) Huh. I never heard you say you admire me for anything.
Eh, listen Mr. Kruger, I got a message from Dr. Van Nostrand and he says it might be wise to you to see another doctor about that mole.
No, no, he mimed it. That's what was so funny about it.
Seriously, have they though about changing the setting?
Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot. I'll pay you back.
. . . naw, it's just you thanked HER, and and oh, . . . what's the difference?
We all got along. Everyone seemed very pleasant.
Yes. I like to feel cozy. I have a very small apartment. I like to feel tucked in, nestled in. Love to be nestled.
(on tape, lifeless) Hey, it's George. I got nothin' to say... (beep)
I tried! I almost threw it down the incinerator, but I couldn't do it. The guilt was too overwhelming. (Grabs the doll, opening the door to leave) Susan's so attached to this thing.
Please, it doesnt look good. Boy, boy, girl.
What do you think about a rocking chair?
I left three messages. I can't believe this woman. She has sex with me, leaves ten minutes later then I never hear from her again. What kind of a person does this? I mean, she used me. I feel cheap and violated.
Name tags! Name tags! What kind of an idiot thinks anybody would be interested in an idea like that.
What kind of a therapist are you? I'm telling I'm scared that something terrible is gonna happen to me, right away you start looking for tumors?
I never heard of anyone would turned down an apartment because of a weak shower spray.
(outside, looking the guy trying the suit through the window, and thinking out loud) What's this? Can't I leave this place for a second? (goes in, take off his jacket, walks to the guy and talks to him with an european accent) Can I help you?
When I was ten years old, my parents had this very same statue on the mantle of our apartment. Exactly. And, one day, I grabbed it, and I was using it as a microphone. I was singing, MacArthur Park, and I got to the part about, Ill never have that recipe again, and it slipped out of my hand and it broke. My parents looked at me like I smashed the ten commandments. To this day, they bring it up. It was the single most damaging experience in my life, aside from seeing my father naked.
Jerry, unless I pull down on this statuette and a hidden wall opens up, we have checked every square inch of this apartment!
Quick. Get this thing back in the pizzeria
Maybe she wasn't! Maybe she heard the whole conversation!
(depressed) Feel like I can't do anything wrong.
What's the difference, you're a woman. They're supposed to be touching you.
I can't believe that you saw her before me.
I know, but don't say anything to anyone. He told me not to tell you.
(to Kramer) It's a funeral procession. . . . (to Elaine) And I got news for you. I show up with Ring Dings and Pepsi, I become the biggest hit of the party. People be coming up to me, "just between you and me I'm really excited about the Ring Dings and the Pepsi. What are we, Europeans with the Beaujolais and Chardonnay . . .
Look it's no secret what's going on between us. (to Jerry) She doesn't like me. Now Jerry if you don't mind.
She probably gets that impression because you're cool. You're under control. Like me. Nothing wrong with that.
Well who schedules his wedding on Super Bowl Sunday?
Sure. So, uh, Jerry, there's an empty apartment in my building. If you and Hallie want, we could try and hold it, may...
Now my parents are gonna know I had people over.
Hey, hey, hey! Whats goin on here? (To Jerry) You didnt agree to anything, did ya?
No, occasionally I'll forget to let the machine pick up. Anyway, they made this large donation, to a women's prison, and I get to go down there and check it out.
During that period when my folks were separated he went a little crazy.
I mean you're just, you're just a marvel of organization.
No! No. It's not good, I don't think so.
Alright, now, how are we gonna monitor this thing?
(examining reflection) I really think this looks pretty good.
I'm not crying. And I shouldn't have said that about your wife. Please accept my apologies.
Well I've never met your sister but obviously these are not hard-and-fast rules. (to the waitress) Darling, the tea is getting a little cold sweetheart.
On-the-street cell-phone call is the lowest phone call you can make.
Well, he has to play! He can't just not play. We're playing! Look, I gotta see him, how do I get in touch with him?
Thinking? Nothing. What could I possibly be thinking?
Hey. There is a couple of people that wouldn't mind having me out of the way.
At the funeral, give or take. You know, deep down, I always kinda felt that they blamed me for Susan's death.
There was an incident. I'd rather not discuss it.
My censor quit two years ago. He checked into a clinic. Emotionally exhausted.
Fabulous, I'll think about that George, thank you!
Why don't we get them a couch? (Kramer laughs) Well rent a U-haul -- well bring em a nice sectional.
But now I have my own market research. Actual Japanese viewers, that love the show! I'm gonna talk to Kramer.
How much do you tip a chamber maid?
He's an obscure writer. Betnik, on the village.
Well, I assume there's some sort of write-off.
We're perfect. I timed this out so we would pull up at the terminal *exactly* 17 minutes after their flight is supposed to land. That gives them just enough time to get off the plane, pick up their bags and be walking *out* of the terminal as we roll up. I tell you, it's a thing of beauty. I can not express to you the feeling I get from a perfect airport pickup. (starts looking around) What's going on? What are you doing? The Long Island Expressway? What are you getting on the Long Island Expressway for? Do you know what the traffic will be like? This is a suicide mission!
I wonder what toilet paper was loike in the 1860's. Did they carry it in rolls in their duffle bags?
Well, does he wear bland, drab, olive colored clothing?
I could go bumper to bumper with any one else on this planet!
Oh, I dont get the enthusiastic hi, Im outta there.
Why? Why isn't it possible? I mean, they're both bite marks.
(more excitement) You were gonna fix me up with her?
We'll have 2 slices and 2 grape sodas.
All I want is my seventy-five cents back, an apology, and for him to be fired!
Lo..k, if you want to taste mine, you don't have to offer me some of yours.
Right. I mean, we're on a subject. Why does it have to be changed?
I dont know, I cant eat. You, you cant have anything anymore. Look at this, look at this. Eggs out. Coffee out. French fries out. BLT out! I go to visit my grandparents three big brisket sandwiches, Im sittin here with a carrot! Theyre closing in on a hundred, Im sayin to them, How can you eat that stuff? (They look at their menus again.) Im so sick about losin that choose, you dont know.
Yes and I was hoping ... to get a thirteen week extension.
I don't want hope. Hope is killing me. My dream is to become hopeless. When you're hopeless, you don't care, and when you don't care, that indifference makes you attractive.
My parents? They don't know *what's* goin' on...
I can't go anywhere, I have to wait here for Tatiana's call. Let me just check.
Why? Because we're a team! C'mon! Would you take this for us, dear? Thank you very much. Here we go... (To Morgan) Anyone ever tell you you look a lot like Sugar Ray Leonard? Yeah, you must get that all the time.
Mr. Pensky. I was just working on your file. I was transferring the contents of the file into this flexible accordion-style folder.
(animated) Are you insane? Jerk store, woulda smoked that guy! Smoked him, I say.
(Pleading) You gotta let me go over there.
Tell me your impressions, I would love to hear what a young woman thinks of "The Big Game".
I saw "Titanic". So that old woman, she's just a liar, right?
You know, I don't see how you can sit there eating that and not even offer me any?
Hey, hey, hey! It's not Lupe's fault, you shouldn't have left it out.
You put a hot tub... in your living room?
Oh. This I need. Hello!! Hello. i..i..is this the hair restoration clinic? ...Does anyone speak English?
(Walks off) I got a lot of thinking to do.
Yeah, I thought I might give her a call. I, I don't meet that many women. I meet like three women a year. I mean, we've been introduced. She knows my name.
I don't wanna tell you how to run your show.
(irascible) Oh, I see. So your time is more valuable than mine. Is that it? You're a delicate genius!
Allison! Hi! Oh, my God! How are you?
Oh no, in and out, I made sure of that. And you'll be happy to know I perused the script and it's met with my approval.
So, how come nothing ever happened between you and Nina? (Getting paranoid) Is there a problem with her? Is she a man?
Yeah.. (Trying to remember) Poverotti.. Domingo.. and.. uh.. the other guy.
I tried to tell you, but you wouldnt listen. No, ho, ho! You were gonna get a deal, huh? Theres no laws in this place. Anything goes! Its Thunderdome!
I don't know, I just can't. Nobody in my family can pay for parking, it's a sickness. My father never paid for parking; my mother, my brother, nobody. We can't do it.
Oh yes, of course, and we have to be fair. (placing the suit further away in the rack)
I can't do this! I can't do it. I have tried. I'm here. It's impossible.
Could you make it two-twenty-five that was his hi-game in bowling.
Like what? I'm bald? What is it specifically? Is, is there an odor I'm not aware of?
So, attractive one day - not attractive the next?
Well you know in college they used to call me the little bulldog.
Hey! Wow, the K-Man! (They walk into the kitchen inside)
Yes they did. I was covering. Elaine has been deported back to Scotland.
Here, just give me a couple of napkins.
You don't understand. He's got this big party coming up. He's been looking forward to this for months. This is gonna destroy the whole thing.
(While pointing at Jerry) Not me! Him! His fault! He betrayed me!
Yes, now. It's gonna take a few days and my parents are gonna be back. I gotta have it back before them!
Well, this is the Jerry Seinfeld that only I know. I can't believe I just told you that.
Well, you know, book reports. That kind of stuff.
Yup, y'know, they really spruce up the apartment.
(to Donna) Why did you have to get me in trouble?
Well that was a really stupid thing! You know what's going to happen now?
Get out!! (Jerry gets out and George drives away. A couple of guys notice Jerry in his cowboy boots.)
Huh. You must think Im pretty stupid. (The mechanic shoots him a look as if he cleary does think hes stupid) That was no 5th Avenue bar. I can see the crumb right there in the corner of your lip! Now, that-that-that is a cookie - and we all know that Twix is the only candy bar with the cookie crunch.
I noticed people staring at my head because they like what they see.
Well, wha-what about the toe? What happened to the toe?
This is George Costanza, I'm calling for my test results. Negative? Oh, my God. WHY! WHY! WHY? What? What? Negative is good? Oh, yes of course! How stupid of me. Thank you. Thank you very much. (he hangs up)
Greetings, people. Greetings. Greetings and salutations. What a beautiful day for a ball game. Let's play two! (Sits down, says to waitress ) Oh, I'll have the chicken salad on rye, my usual, you know what I get, darlin'. (Turns to the Gang) So, let's see, I had a little conversation today with Mr Don Mattingly - (to Elaine) he's the first base man.
I, ... am breaking up with, ... you.
(Puts his hands on his face, rubbing his eyes) Look. It's a skill, just like juggling. She probably enjoys showing it off.
He-he was uh touching and rubbing. (nervous laugh)
All right, All right, keep your towel on.
Come on. Come check out my new place. It'll take you two minutes.
(Silently squinches his mouth and nods at Kramer)
I like to stop at the duty free shop.
What're you doing? What're you, telling secrets? What're you laughing at?
The door? Why would I go out the door? The window's right here.
Just because a candy bar fails to fall from its perch
This is all too much. So what are you feeling? What's going on? Are you like a couple again now?
I had the perfect situation here, he was shouldering half the load.
She missed her period? Oh my god. I can't believe it! I'm a father! I did it! My boys can swim! I can do it! I can do it!
I heard what you said "Sharon, are you there?".
So eh, you eh, wanna get together tomorrow?
You wanna sell computers? I will show *you* how to sell computers! Hello, Mr. Farneman. You wanna buy a computer? No? Why not? All right, I see! Good answer! Thank you! (Lloyd rings his sale bell) Serenity now!
You took me to one of your shows..
Is she the only girl in the whole world? Why can't you get find your own girl?
So we jump and roll, you won't get hurt.
Alright, stop it Kramer, you're freakin' me out. (The waitress comes over.)
Elaine, when a woman makes a Ball Entrance.. she twirls.
I lost them. I can usually come up with one good comment during a meeting but by the end it's buried under a pile of gaffs and bad puns.
Is that what I ask for? The BIG salad?
Oh, no no no. I pay what I say.
Morning Thunder has caffeine in it, Jerry doesn't drink caffeine.
(opening door to leave) He picked her up?
I mean we can put a man on the moon but we're still basically very stupid. The guy who's car this is? He could be one of the guys that built the rocket. You see what I'm saying?
I love the mirror in that bathroom! I dont know what in the hell it is. I look terrific in that mirror. (George sits.) I dont know if its the tile or the lighting... I feel like Robert Wagner.
Oh...(is about to tell Jerry, but reconsiders) ...clothing, something, I dunno. So, uh, what are you doing today?
All right, but we're not buyin' it at Bloomingdale's. I will buy it, you pay me back later. I'll sniff out a deal. I have a sixth sense.
So, you were saying how, um...about the script...
So, where you gonna stick this (points to the Fusilli Jerry)
Of course not! Wash it, dry it, move on!
(incredulous) You can't ground me, I'm a grown man.
So, they didn't give you a piece of cake? Big deal.
It's like some pod landed from another planet and took your body. Don't fall asleep Elaine.
Say you, me, and Kramer are, uh, flying over the Andes.
Oh, you lying little snot. And he's a cheater. Aren't ya' you little twerp?
You know what? It doesn't matter, because I quit!
Oh man! I knew I was gonna love the opera.
Yeah, well I uh got lots of other stuff to show you too. Wait till you see the plum job that I landed.
It would have been nice if someone told me about it. I just think you could have said something. That's all.
Of course you do, but youre imagining a guy you like, not a guy who goes, Oh no, I dont drink coffee late at night. If I call her now, shes gonna think Im too needy. Women dont wanna see need. They want a take-charge guy  a colonel, a Kaiser, a tsar.
Have you ever seen a Schnitzer's rye? It - it's huge!
I dont know what the hell I said. I gave her an ultimatum and theres nothing I can do. Its a machine. The little light is blinking right now, Come and listen to the idiot. Hey everybody, the idiots on!
Yeah, yeah, well, because of the cane. You should see the bathroom they gave me!
Oh, well, a mantel's a whole different story.
I've been doing a lot of thinking. This might be my chance to start giving something back.
But Kramer, isn't it a question of hygiene?
I can't believe I didn't push for this sooner.
(Watching the mechanic leave) I know about the vein! I cant believe this guy..
You're Killing Independent George! You know that, don't you?
You know, if I could get this Coco woman down to Kruger, they wouldn't be able to call me Koko anymore because Kruger would never allow 2 Kokos.
Jerry. Marla. (Realizing Jerry's cue) Stacey! (Walks over to Stacey)
You lie! How hard is it to lie?!
I just got here. My car broke down on the Belt Parkway.
Well, people never give a good 'hello' at a funeral. I mean, they go like this (George gives an extremely understated nod) That's the biggest.
You shook my hand in that coffee shop.
How can you compare you parents to my parents?!
I'm just gonna...wash. (George walks to the bathroom; screaming) WHY DID I PUT UP TWO? WHY DID I PUT UP TWO?
(Yelling from the bathroom) Don't tell her anything, she'll kill me!!
He's coming up?! (Moves to the door) I'll check you out later.
Y'know the average life span for an American male is like, 72. You're really... kinda pushin' the envelope there.
(upset) But you can't stay here. There's no place to sleep!
(taking out wallet) Well, let me. Heh. Let me just eh.. check an', make sure I have the right man--ha! Heh, heh, heh! Seems--oh! I, oh! (has conveniently dropped the photo into her view)
It's fine, it doesn't have to be about nothing.
(Putting his hands up) Alright, alright, hold on! (Jerry has George's full attention) Time out! Woah, woah! (Scooting in, giddy) What did she say?
So go ahead pigeons. hu hu hu. Laugh it up. I'm getting in my car now and the last I heard ... we have NO DEAL!
(Nervous, his voice cracks) Hey, Antonio. How's it going?
Well, it wouldn't fit you. The sleeves are too short.
(pulls a face) I find it disorienting. Who buys an umbrella anyway? Y..you get 'em for free in the coffee shop in the metal cans.
You fixed me up with a bald woman.
I know, I know. Kind of a cute Nazi though.
What if the pilot gets picked up and it becomes a series?
(swerving) Hey! Watch it! Did you see that guy? He just gave me the finger!
(interrupting) You know we should really order, the service is so slow here, by the time you get anything...
We should have left earlier. I told you.
What, you're gonna pass up a wonderful opportunity to put that aloe pusher in her place?
Youre doomed. Youre gonna have to have all your sex at womens apartments. Itll be like a permanent road trip. Forget about the home bed advantage.
Not that much. You know, they tend to shrink in the water.
Yeah. (Noticing this makes him out to be the bad kid, he gets defensive) Well, I couldn't run over there the way I was!
W--then I'm pretty much where I am now. At least I got to take a ride on a spaceship.
(to Jerry, as Jerry nods in agreement) You know I think she might have something there.
Eh, I can't. I gotta go down to the foundation. I'm interviewing high schoolers for the Susan Ross.. scholarship.
(looking at his watch) I really should get going. Y'know, I..I wanna be home in case Neil calls.
O.K., Danny, take a swing. (Tartabull swings the bat.) N-No! No! No! You're opening up your shoulder.
Oh right, right! The blue sweatpants! Gees, it's too bad you can't say anything because of Angela.
What about your old car? They couldn't get Kramer's blood out of it?
Attention Steinbrenner and front-office morons! Your triumphs mean nothing. You all stink. You can sit on it, and rotate! This is George Costanza. I fear no reprisal. Extension five-one-seven-oh.
Dad, you really should lay off the 'serenity now' stuff.
What? I'm not married. I'm not allowed to go out with somebody else?
(To Jerry) Let me ask you something.. How much do you think it would cost to have tonsils and adenoids removed in the hospital?
Why shave every day? It just grows right back.
Oh, no, thanks. I cant drink coffee late at night, it keeps me up.
It's two completely different sounds. "ih" and "eh".
Did you see the homeless guy on the library steps screaming obsenities and doing some calesthetics routine
So concerned was he, that word of his poor tennis skills might leak out, he chose to offer you his wife as some sort of mediaeval sexual payola?
(shouting) What happened to Soda?! I thought we all agreed on Soda.
Yeah, they eh, they do a lot of baking up there.
Monica, I'm really focused here, this stuff's a killer. (turns to the next page)
"There's a lot of money in this.. He's got a proven sales method"
You know, I could let it go for.. say.. a hundred and twenty-five.
There could be more than one O'Brien on a plane who ordered a limo.
'Cause believe me, I would only say this to you and maybe a psychiatrist, maybe. Well, her nose is a little big.
The cabin.. (Laughs nervously) Well.. (Pauses as he thinks of a way to break the news, then decides to pass it off) Susan?
'Kay. I'll uh, I'll see you later. Anybody want some tomatoes?
My moneys all tied up in change right now.
He mentioned my name?! What did he say?!
Ah, get outta here. The vomiting is much funnier.
I mean, it's not fair. I've been going there for 7 years. She's been there 3 weeks.
Lemme see. I can't believe you got these for free. (Looking at the tickets) Row F?!
(fever pitch) Marisa Tomei's sitting home, Elaine! Wh..why didn't you tell me that Katy was friends with Marisa Tomei?!
All these years I've been chuckin' and you've never told me?
Wha..? I didn't tell you? I gotta go meet Elaine.
You be nice! He's giving me a parking space (echoes) parking space... parking space...
Hold on. Hold on. Wait a minute. How am I gonna get the rye bread into the apartment?
Let me ask you a question. Who would win in a fight between you and me?
Kramer, Kramer, I need to know if Nina is refunding.
Anyway, right in the middle, the ship blows up-- burning debris, bodies falling-- and then just as this eerie silence settles over the airfield, I yelled out, "That's gotta hurt!"
I though we said we weren't going to discuss that now!
Do you know what happens if I miss him? I don't get credit for the pickup and I lose my 50 bucks...
It's one think to not give me the extension But to tease and to torture me like this. There's no call for that.
So, Elaine, are you going to sleep with me or what?!
Wha-Is that the one your parents gave you?
I still won't be able to forgive myself - but at least it won't be about this.
He never finished the sentence. He got a call, that was the end of the interview.
I'd like to say it once to someone that can actually hear it!
I've tried. We don't have it. But maybe the two of us, working together at full capacity, could do the job of one normal man.
Whew! Boy, it's cold outside, huh? Oh, these New York winters, huh. Bitter cold, bitter.
What, I can't stop by and visit my parents? (Drops pamphlet on coffee table)
No, no, no... Just a *tiny* bit... It's not even *frontal* nudity. It's... *sidal* nudity...
(shaking his head, weary) It doesn't matter. (he leaves)
You know they used to make leisure suits out of this fabric?
Yes, flowers. I will get her flowers, I will go to the florist!
I believe you cut me off, and then made an obscene gesture.
9... 1... 1. She said she'd do anything. Hello, police? Uh, yeah listen, we're in the back of a limo in Queens--
Thanks. You know this could sound crazy but, what do you think about adding a drawer for - like a blanket?
Ha! Ha! Hey! (moving his arms like it's so great to be all here)
Didn't say anything. (They go into Elaine's apartment.)
"throws your hips off kilter" So where's your money? (pulls out his wallet)
Well I didn't know you wanted to go to the flea market.
Well all right, beautiful, so you stop in. Ya, ya visit the bubble boy for twenty minutes and then we can go.
Uh, excuse me. Uh, pound of Arabian mocha java, please.
We were in the lobby during the intermission of the play. I was buying her one of those containers of orange drink, for five dollars. I reached into my pocket to pay for it, I looked down; theres this piece of green floss hanging from my fingers.
(to Jerry) You watch the old videos. (insistent) I'm telling you, look at him.
(Smiling) You got it, Ma. (She smiles back, nodding) A little later. (George sits back in a nearby chair, looking at the divider in anticipation)
No no no no, you have to approach this as if he was a woman.
(suspicious) They haven't said anything to you, have they?
I told her what a sexist he is. How he cheats on his wife.
(passes cane from right to left and back a few times) But, see here. Right. Wrong. Right. Wrong. Right. Right. Wrong--
Yeah, yeah, yeah we could. You know, ah, Kramer, the next time you talk to her, find out if she knows Kelly, from Monk's. I wanna know if she really has a boyfriend.
I suppose I could just pull this out ( his tucked shirt)and walk around like this and you wouldn't care?
(While skimming a Monk's menu) You know, I didn't go to the bathroom the entire time we were in India.
I can't believe you're not playing in cotton.
No, I brought a picture of the chair.
The Rosses have started up a foundation, Jerry, and I have to sit on the board of directors.
(to Susan's stone) ...And then, right after the All-Star Break, we, we just swept the Orioles. Four games. In Baltimore. (adjusts necktie nervously) So... yeah.
Ah, you still going on in front of Bania, eh?
Hu, oh. No he thought I was hiding something from him about Morgan.
Yeah and you get this really cool T-shirt when you sign on..
You saw him. He was fiddling with the engine. God knows what he did there.
Yeah, you know we spoke for a little bit...
Yeah. (clears his throat) We should do this again.
But your life is Peterman's. Now the bus tour, which is real, takes to places that, while they are real, they are not real in sense that they did not *really* happen to the *real* Peterman which is you.
Yeah, I think, you know, she was, like, crying, and he was consoling her, and then, she, uh, just got into his car, and they just drove away.
Yep. Classic horseshoe pattern. I've seen a lot of this.
Where are you gettin' a Wizard for fifty dollars?
Well, I feel better already. I'm feelin' like a good person.
Hi. I'm ah, I'm here to see a Mr. Art Vandelay..
Why'd I think it was timbre? Yeah, she could do voiceover commercials, why didn't you tell me about her voice?
Nougat? Please. I think Ive reached the point in my life where I can tell the difference between nougat and cookie. So lets not just say things that we both know are obvious fabrications.
Well, as I say, the pink-eye made my vision...quite blurry... (Joe's daughter comes to the door.)
He knows I'm waiting. He sees me. He just doesn't wanna look.
Let me ask you this. If you stick your hand in the hair is it easy to get it out?
It's funny! (To Elaine) and it wouldn't kill you to not be so funny either.
(cuts into Jerry talking) Chocolate chip mint? Oh well, actually Jerry I prefer chocolate chip. What is it about the chocolate and the mint that makes it go so well together?
Was she uh, was she a big, uh woman?
try shaking it...(long pause) Well,Janet should be here any minute.
What, you think I'm going to repeat the whole thing now?
Well this is bad. I am really in a bad situation now.
Oh no! Im vigilant. Theyll never get me out. Im like a weed, Jerry.
Out? Oh no, I've been to four other places, you're the only ones that have had it.
Yes, and I'm speaking at a men's' conference.
Just one? I'm living like twenty. (chuckles) What's yours?
Yeah, and I - I heard you got on their good side. Now, what'd you do?
Should I give you my keys, is that the transaction, trading keys...? Because Elaine has my keys.
Anyway, I was thinking about what you said. About uh, me and Marisa.
This guy from my old neighborhood. Lloyd Braun. He's a big advisor to Mayor Dinkins. He thinks he's so cool.
You know, I'm down to one kiss hello. My aunt Sylvia.
Do you think it might be possible to add a little shelf like, uh, for an alarm clock?
Actually I think I'm gonna take a few days off (starts to leave)
Not really. Your voice kind of raises to this comedic pitch. (Kramer enters)
Why couldn't you squeeze one of those stupid rubber balls to get your stress out? Why did you have to destroy *twenty-five* computers?
An apartment-warming gift? We got to give presents to people for moving? Birthdays, Christmas, it's enough gifts. I would like one month off.
Eh...come oooon...(starts stabbing the paper with the pen. Mr. Wilhelm comes in)
Actually, (George flips the book back to the beginning) I'll take these nice glossy ones.
Is that what's hurting your appreciation for the story?
Yeah, yeah. You must have squirted a piece of pulp in it too.
He said he didn't know what it was.
You think this is the plane that Ted Danson gets?
Well you know what happens with larvae hatch, they-they're everywhere.
Well perhaps, not to the extent that you are. But I know the basic plot. Yeah.
Ha, Yeah right, hang on, Ill ah, Ill get her for you. he, he, he, he. Seriously, what's up?
What do you think? The brought it over in pieces and screwed it together like a coffee table?
There's nothing I can even impart to you, that's the sad thing. It's so inborn, I can't pass it on. (begins backing into the space) Look at this guy. Are you crazy, what are you doing?! Hey! Hey, you're stealing my space!
Why does she want you to be mad?
Oh, I found him. He was sitting on the steps of the library. I sat down next to him. He smelled like the locker room after that game against Erasmus
You know what I think? I bet she stole a tractor.
Take toilet paper for example. Do you realize that toilet paper has not changed in my lifetime? It's just paper on a cardboard roll, that's it. And in ten thousand years, it will still be exactly the same because really, what else can they do?
[studying his jacket] Oh man! Look at this! I sat in gum. Oh, by the way, you owe me seven fifty.
I told her I was out o' soda, I went out to get some, an' I never went back.
Hey, by the way, what'd you think of Miss Yoshimura?
Yes, two solariums. Quite a find. And I have horses, too?
The last time I saw her, she was naked.
No, I-I-I know... [retreats back to his Chinese take out] I know...
She knows that I have her clock. I know that she has my hat. I think she's getting ready to make an exchange.
It says very clearly, 'for your protection, do not give your secret code to anyone.'
Probably because this whole Universe is against me!
Ah ha, Ah ha. You would, wouldn't you?
Well, it doesn't even have to be the general manager. Maybe I could be like, an announcer. Like a color man. You know how I always make those interesting comments during the game.
(realizing he was short changed) I was in the pool! I was in the pool!
What, are you crazy? It's a traumatic thing to be thrown up on.
The government is very touchy about us being in the air. Let us run around on the ground as much as we want. Anything in the air is a big production.
(animated) What're you kidding me? We were all getting along so well. Where is all this coming from?
Of course, the uh, the four passes. (closes partition) Four passes to Madison Square Garden? Wait a minute. Wait a minute! Of course! Chicago! The Knicks are playing the Bulls tonight!
Oh, I can't believe you're dropping out, too. So now Kramer and I have to pay for the entire gift?
(pointedly) She could do a lot worse than Mr Peanut, my friend.
Maybe she could like me? Is it that far fetched? Maybe she sees something? Is it possible?
Okay, go ahead. Call her, get married, have babies, have a great life.. What do I care? I'm finished. (Really depressed) It's all over for me. In fact, let's end it right now. Jerry, kill me, kill me now. I'm begging you. Let's just get it over with. Be a pal.. Just take the pillow and put it over my face.
You're gonna rip it. You're gonna rip it.
Jerry, would you do me a favor, close the window.
I got a feeling I'm gonna be much smarter than you pretty soon.
He's beboppin' and scattin', and I'm losin' it!
(Wanting Elaine to take it off his hands, he tries to silence Jerry) Jerry, simmer down.
(disbelief) What?! They're stealing the name?! That's my name, I made it up!
Anyway, I think everything else is okay. Unless of course she's faking.
All day. ( phone rings , Jerry picks up)
Okay. Uh, my mother is is going to pay for the sessions. ... Oh,Elaine?
You think it's contact? It has to be touched?
Of course not. You don't care what I look like.
A garden! I cant believe theres a garden!
(Trying to keep it down) Because I like this one! (Notices people staring at him, he quickly gets up, collecting the his coat and the tiny replica) C'mon, let's go. Let's go! (On his way out, he stops in front of a woman blocking his path) Oh, hi.. (Embarrassed about the doll, he sheepishly walks out)
Im outta there. I did it! Its over.
Uh, heading out. Jerry really hates to miss the coming attractions.
(to salesman) Well, maybe you could show me something else.
He's a jerk. (nudges to his right but no one is there)
Hey, there's a tomato stand, let's stop, I can get some more.
No, no, no, see you're not really listening.
Hey, where you just at the health club?
(excited) So then, as we were leaving, we were just kind of standing there, and she was sort of smiling at me, and I wasnt sure if she wanted me to ask her out, because when women smile at me I dont know what it means. Sometimes I interpret it like theyre psychotic or something and I dont know if Im supposed to smile back, I dont know what to do. So I just stood there like  remember how Quayle looked when Benson gave him that Kennedy line? Thats what I looked like.
Well, I think Poppie's got some problems. There's a whole other thing going on with Poppie. So how did you leave it?
...so mind you, at this point I'm only going out with her two or three weeks. So she goes out of town and she asks me to feed her cat. So at this time, there's a lot of stuff going on in my life and, uh, it slips my mind for a few days. Maybe a week. Not a week, five, six days.
Dad, he doesn't need to see the pole.
Not everybody knows what the crop circles are. (to the newsstand owner) Do you know what the crop circles are?
I usually spend Saturday afternoons with Susan. She's gonna want to know what I'm doing. I can't use Jerry, he's in Florida.
(to Claire) Now, a woman calls me, all right?
Well, I'm the boyfriend. Otherwise, what's the point of being the boyfriend? This is where you have to be when you're the boyfriend.
You've got to start seeing someone else. Get out of this relationship.
Elaine said your pretty good at this stuff.
Wow! I didn't try that 'til I was 23.
Thats all there is to it. By Christmas day I will be Brother Costanza.
I don't know, I like stuff you don't have to think about too much.
"There may be a problem with the phone, hold on"!
Elaine...let me just explain something to you. See, this is not just a weekend routine...I'm on the verge of make-up sex here. You know about make-up sex?
(after waitress walks away) I don't believe it, she did it again!
I don't know, but those are my socks! I had a pair just like that with the blue stripe, and now I don't have them anymore!
(Laughs) You, I guess, you don't remember me.. but we actually, kind of um.. went out.. a couple of years ago.. once.. remember?
Sometimes it's good to have a pencil to write these things down.
Youre a back-up, youre a second-line, a just-in-case, a B-plan, a contingency!
(on the phone) Uh, Mrs. Ross? It's-it's George.
It's Allison. I dated her right after you. She's obsessed with me.
Uh, excuse me, Wyck. Uh, are we, uh, almost done here?
Yeah! Look at me! I was free and clear! I was living the dream! I was stripped to the waist, eating a block of cheese the size of a car battery!
Very exciting, very exciting, it's like watching a birth.
Babu Bhatt? How I'm going to explain this?
Theres just no justice. This experience has changed me. Its made me more cynical, more bitter, more jaded.
Wow, he really does a number on you. (reads) "Seinfeld froze like a deer in the headlights in the face of incessant heckling."
What are you kidding? We look great! You know what this pudding needs? The skin on the top, you know like your mother used to make it on the stove.
uh, Uh, Vandelay Industries, is uh. 129 West 81st street. It's a very small industry Vandelay. It's one of the reasons I wanted to uh, work for them.
I think I like the girl better than the voice.
Oh Jerry, that is so sweet of you but actually i already ate.
(on phone  calling secretary) Hello Margery, George Costanza. How are you sweet heart? Listen, can you give Mr. Thomassoulo a message for me? Yes. If he needs me, tell him (screams) IM IN MY OFFICE! Thanks.
Well, we're collectors. We, uh, see objects of great beauty and, uh, we must have them.
(frantic) Oh, Jerry Jerry Jerry Jerry Jerry, listen, if, if you are feeling uncomfortable about this at all, at all. Do not feel like you have to take it.
And I have to go. If I don't go, he'll know I'm lying.
Excuse me. Can I talk to you for a second there, Watkins?
Listen Sheila it's not what you think. I put my trust into the wrong person. He said the key word was tasteful.
You already have an in. You have the same first name!... (no reaction) 'Jerry'!
(Chuckling) yeah. Uh, oh, here's your sunglasses. (Hands them to her)
You think she liked me? She seemed to like me.
Look, you wanna have sex right now? Do want to have sex with me right now? Let's go! C'mon, let's go baby! C'mon!
No, you're not a divorcee. Youre just separated. You're---you're a separatee.
I'm not stable? I'm like a rock. I take these glasses off, you can't tell the difference between me and a rock. I put these glasses on a rock. You know what jumps into most people's minds? Costanza!
What if she becomes Miss America? You could be dating Miss America, Jerry!
Oh, oh. Uh, you know. It's the damndest thing. I, uh, I moved recently and my files, pfff, disappeared. Now, I-I don't know if they fell off the truck or if there was some sort of foul play but let me tell you something. I'm not through with that moving company.
Yes, of course I'm taking Allison. This woman is genetically engineered to go to a ball. Tall, blonde, lithe--
Well, I took the liberty of packing your things. (gleeful) Mom's coming to get you.
I got engaged. I'm getting married. I asked Susan to marry me. We're getting married this Christmas.
Because filth is good. Whaddaya think, rock stars have sponges and ammonia lyin around the bathroom? They, have a woman comin over, Ive gotta tidy up? Yeah right, in these matters you never do what your instincts tell you. Always, ALWAYS do the opposite.
See now that bothers me even more than dying bothers me, cause it's people like you who live to be a hundred and twenty because you're not bothered by it. How could it not bother you?
(Muttering) Susan has the doll collection.. one of the dolls looks exactly like my mother.. she likes to sleep with it.
If anyone should be forced to leave that place, it should be her!
Yeaah, beautiful... (They try to hit a high five, but George hits Elaine in the forehead.) Sorry...
Excuse me, are you the guy with that funny laser?
Yes. Well -- So, uh, sit on the same side at a booth, huh?
Aha. Aha. Could it be because you don't want him to know that you have a friend who pees in the shower, is that it?!
Make-up sex? You have to have that right after the fight, we're way past that.
No, no. No, no, no. It was not trash!
(excited, pushing Jerry forward) All right, let's go, let's go, let's go, come on.
(internally) How am I gonna get out of this? Think Costanza, think!
Well, I'm sorry, Timmy...but I don't dip that way. (takes a chip.)
You know, like the general manager of a baseball team or something.
Yeah, let him chew on that for a while.
It it's huge. It's probably like North Dakota.
So, I'm uh, I'm afraid we're going to have to pass.
Ho, ha, ho! Jerry Seinfeld's a funny guy!
Nothing, why? You think something's wrong? Am I different?
Well I was dropping of the calzone money for the week.... Um shouldn't you be at work by now?
(upset) I *told* you the Drake was bad! I hate the Drake!
I was squinting! Remember that drive from Wortsborough? (snapping his fingers) I was spotting those raccoons.
No, and you weren't funny last night either. In fact, you got us both so depressed, she asked me to drive her home after dinner.
Well, cause we were just saying we were going to ask you to come up to the country with us this weekend. Susan's father has a cabin up there. But, eh, all right, well.
Good. Cause if this is a lie, if this is a joke, if this is your idea of some cute little game we're finished!
Huh... Cape... (turns, distracted, heads slowly towards door) What was a man with a cape doin' with my father?... What was my father doing with a man in a cape?... (opens door) Why a cape? Hmm! (exits)
I was betrayed! That kid was like a son to me. And if there's one person you should be able to hold down, it's your own flesh and blood. Like my father.. my father's father before him.
Well I can't now, Gwen's going to be there.
Well, it was very nice meeting you Shelly and Jerry be careful, there's a lot of nuts out there. (to Paula) All right you have everything?
Alrighty. Ah ... my last job was in publishing ... I uh got fired for having sex in my office with the cleaning woman.
I dunno, Jerry somethin's missing. There's a void, Jerry, there's a void...
Oh I'm going baby! I'm going! (he leaves)
What does she need? Maybe there's something that she needs.
Yes, yes. Very smooth, super smooth. No, but I really wanna attack this thing, you know. Sink my teeth into it. So I was just wondering... what do you think would be the very best way to get started?
I told I had a bus transfer that was only good just for another hour.
It's about the show. It... No, it was...
Can I ask you a question? Would you mind switching seats?
Smarter than me? I don't want anyone smarter than me.
Who gets picked off in softball? Its unheard of.
(angry that she believes Al was right) No he's not right. Al Netchie is not right! Alright I'm canceling the father-son picnic. I don't know what he's gonna do with all that potato salad.
The nickname. George. What is that? It's nothing. It's got no snap, no zip. I need a nickname that makes people light up.
You told him? What did you tell him?
You see those tears streaming down you don't know what to do. It was like she was on fire and I was trying to put her out.
And then, (Smacks the money) there were two.
We're gonna hang around here a little while....something funny going on here
(anger) Well now it's not gonna be original! It's gonna lose all its cachet!
I don't even like to use urinals, always been a stall man.
Thank you for leaving me alone with him!
I was all primed for the first row; I was gonna put my feet up on the dugout!
What is that, Boyfriend? I don't understand that. What, what does she think I asked her out for?
Fifty bucks a month, that's incredible! Okay, thanks.
I don't know. A little thing called Step Nine? Instead of an apology, he was beboppin' and scattin' all over me.
That's not the point. The point is I was here first.
Well, maybe it was Ghostbusters? Where ever it was, it worked!
Jiffy Park. It's incredible.. Seventy-five dollars a month.
Just when I was doing great. I told you God wouldn't let me be successful.
No no, this is a matter of principle. That would just be saying that anybody could just pull into any parking space any way they want. Well I'm making a stand here. I'm saying *no* to head first parking. I'm not putting up with that. We put up with too much crap in this city, we're not putting up with head first parking.
Oh, yeah I'm sure he loves to hear from fans in the locker room.
Oh no no no no, don't say anything to Kramer. Susan can't stand him. He vomited all over her.
Ah, I've had everything on the menu. Uh, surprise me.
Just..go back. Pretend the whole thing never happened.
My parents don't read! They're gonna wonder what a book is doing on the table!
Students cant clean. Its anathema. (explaining) They dont like it.
Yeah I guess. What can I do? I gotta take her with me. Todd introduced us, I'm obligated.
What did they do for toilet paper in the civil war?
Aw great. Now the volume knob fell off
Shut your traps and stop kicking the seats! We're trying to watch the movie! And if I have to tell you again, we're gonna take it outside and I'm gonna show you what it's like! You understand me? Now, shut your mouths or I'll shut 'em for ya, and if you think I'm kidding, just try me. Try me. Because I would love it!
I got me an appointment with a hardware store. I'm not saying I want to do it for the rest of my life, but, uh, hardware fascinates me. Don't you love to make a key?
Sperry Rand Building. 14th floor, Morgan Apparel. Mention my name - she'll give you the key.
I know, I know...don't skimp. Go go go go...
She's been locked up for two years. She's gonna want to make up for lost time. Dinners. Movies. (Rubs his forehead.) Talking...
Wow, Keith Hernandez. He's such a great player.
Madam? What are you calling me madam for?
(leaving) Alright that's it for me. Good night everybody.
Must be one of those rich, spoiled handicapped people, who didn't want to do any work, and just wanted to sit in her wheelchair and take it easy.
March 21st. Hey! So, you're gonna back me on this, right?
Severance package...The Yankees are giving me three months full pay for doing nothing.
Oh. It's just horse manure (huh huh - laughs, he points back at the horse that walked by) Horse manure's not that bad. I don't even mind the word manure. You know, it's, it's nure, which is good. and a ma in front of it. MA-NURE. I mean when you consider the other choices, manure is actually pretty refreshing.
Y'know people, we got a situation over here!
(Looking at his finger) I think somethin bit me. I just need another nickel.
Oh, uh, "The Falconer" by John Cheever. It's really excellent.
Hey, I work for Kruger Industrial Smoothing "We don't care, and it shows."
Don't you understand? It's not about him. To have a line as perfect as 'jerk store' and to never use it. I, I couldn't live with myself.
Yeah, the tenant association has decided to hear my side of the story. So, uh, I gotta kinda get ready. I'll see ya.
Yeah, they're all through ruining my life. What the hell are they still doing here? Lemme see this pamphlet. Hm. All right, so I'll, uh, get back to you.
UH, ha ha, ... It's just SO frustrating. It's a brand new jacket.
She invited me up. Coffees not coffee, coffee is sex.
I'll fake an illness. (Acts it out) My back! My back! I can't believe, my back.
Have you ever given your code to anyone?
So, they go off for the ride, by the time they come back the bread is there.
One of your guys - Kip, or Ned, short name - stole my Twix candy bar!
Lloyd Braun? What d'you have to meet him for?
Pretend you didn't know it was there. Can you see it?
Anyway, we met with NBC about a month ago and they gave us the green light to go ahead and write a pilot. In fact, we got a big meeting with them tomorrow. They gotta approve of the story before we can write.
I just remembered, I gotta be someplace. Yuh-hu-hur, that's enough. Pop. Pop, put down the wrench, Pop.
Are you often on business trip? Nice...oh, hey nice ice-bucket.
Oh, I had it perfectly timed out the Grand Central, the Van Wyck! You destroyed my whole timing!
I was personable. Don't you think I was personable?
Jerry gargles? Is that why he takes so long?
What kind of a sick, demented person wants another person's glasses?
No, Im saying, if a situation arose in which you didnt want it, I might take it.
But I have to have them by one o'clock. He's very regiment about his meals.
I didn't shave this morning. I don't feel like myself.
Jerry, come on. If my mother keeps shrinking, this is exactly what she's gonna look like in ten years!
(To Estelle) Scissor. (She gets the scissors from the coffee table and hands them to George with the point facing him) Don't hand them to me with the point facing out!
Yeah, eighty-three. Used to belong to John Voight.
Yeah. What are you doing with the Daily Worker?
I show up. I pretend I have the job. The guy's on vacation. If I have the job, it's fine. If I don't have the job, by the time he comes back, I'm ensconced.
(Entering Jerry's apartment with a cartload of computers) Jerry, I've found a way to beat Lloyd Braun! I buy the computers myself, I store 'em in your apartment. Then, after I win the contest, I bring 'em all back and get my money back. Ha ha! It's brilliant. What? What's wrong with your leg?
Yeah. Hey, wait a second, you know, good news for you too. Susan's best friend, Hallie? Broke up with her boyfriend.
Jerry, what do you, you wanna, you wanna see the place or not?
The Chinese have done it my friend. The Chinese have done it.
Y'know, the funny thing is, somehow I find her more appealing now... It's like if I knew she was a lesbian when we went out, I never would've broken up with her.
Well, aren't you the boss of him? You shouldn't let him move up! When I was in the Cub Scouts, I got stuck on Weebolos for three years 'cause I kept losing the Pinewood Derby.
O.k....(thinks) I think I know where we can get one.
She's working late that night. We're - were supposed to have dinner with everybody at eight o'clock so I'll set up the ride for seven o'clock.
Yeah, well, I guess the only thing I can do is go into George Steinbrenners office and tell him he has to give her a raise.
Yeah, but get this, the message said 'call me if you have the time'. Heh heh if I have the time, you get it?
(afraid not) No no, no no no. You're not goin' in there.
Woo! Courtside! (mock-snide) Is that the best you could do? Ha ha!
I asked if I could borrow a sweater.
It took a couple of hours of convincing. I was persistent. I was just like those guys in the movies. And it worked! She said "Yes"! I can't believe my luck that she was still available . A beautiful woman like that. You think she's good looking, right?
I'm George.. George Costanza.. I've never been in the hospital a day in my life.. except when I had my tonsils out. You know, they never gave me any ice cream. I always felt that-
Fine. Steal the battery. Now, all right, here is the Frogger. This is the front door, and this is the outlet.
(he just took a bite of the Chinese food ) This is terrible. What is this, ginger? I hate ginger. I can't understand how anyone can eat ginger. (puts the container back in the refrigerator.)
Is that right? I just threw away a lifetime of guilt-free sex, and floor seats for ever sporting event in Madison Square Garden. So please, a little respect. For I am Costanza Lord of the Idiots!
And a guy will appear from out of nowhere. I say "Get out of here! What do you want? You don't belong here!"
Yeah, yeah, sure, Christmas. Snow. Santa. All that stuff.
Hello, Ken. It's George Costanza. I think we need to talk.
To do what?! Work in a post office? Is that what you want me to do?
Oh! Here you are. Ha ha...You, uh, you want to--
It's a pot pourri. May I, uh, may I show you the master bedroom? (they leave together)
I think I was affected by the caffeine.
They wanna have another meeting? They wanna buy it?! They wanna but it?! Oh! I tell you! We're gonna be rich!! What are we gonna get for this? Fifty, sixty thousand?
Don't go shouting we got a hundred dollar bill. People will be jumping out of windows on top of us.
I was not winking you idiot. That was the grapefruit. It's like acid. I need that card back. It's Mr. Steinbrenner's. I was responsible.
Did you feel that tension? We use to have banter - (puts menu back with frustration) - there's no more banter.
If it makes you happy, I don't focus on these things. I will tell you this Unfortunately, we live in a very superficial society. I don't condone it, but it's a fact of life.
Pack of gum. Here you go. (hands the clerk a $100 bill)
I'll tell ya, if I had one of these things, I'd be eatin' hot dogs all the time.
(from bathroom) VANDELAY, SAY VANDEL... (George falls) ... Vandelay Industries, ...
(shouts) Awright already!! This is a very key issue with me, Jerry. I had this name for a long time.
(Looks fed up with his parents) Oh my God..
Of course I'm not Cartwright! Look, why don't you two just go to the movies all by yourselves, I'm not in the mood.
That's right! He never apologized to me for saying that I would stretch out the neck hole of his sweater.
Alright. 7,7, (points at himself) 6. I'm not gonna eat that much!
What do you mean "might"? You don't think he really owned this car?
No, you haven't. Well, maybe you have. What do I know.
Oh my God, I forgot to tell you. I got a letter today from the State Controller's Office. Y'know when I was going to public school back in Brooklyn, every week I used to put fifty cents in the Lincoln Savings Bank.
Every summer you guys went to camp together. I was jealous. Felt like he was the summer me.
Yeah, people who work at NORAD, whore on twenty-four hour missile watch. Everything was going along so great. She was laughing, I was funny... I kept saying to myself, Keep it up, dont blow it, youre doing great.
You know, it's a miracle you're not married. (beat) Hey, I'm not obligated to buy anything, am I?
You can't break up with me. I've got hand.
Because important things go in a case. You got a skull for your brain, a plastic sleeve for your comb, and a wallet for your money.
What? Huh, so I had it all along. How d'you like that? (snorts) I guess I owe that cashier an apology.
Alright, what are we getting? It's hot in here!
(Sitting on the sofa) I'm on no sleep, bro.
Oh, she didn't think it was funny. What is she, Rowan & Martin? We're supposed to meet with NBC tomorrow! She completely shattered my confidence. And I'm paying for this, she's my employee!
Or, I could take the twenty, then I could pay *you* later.
In the whole world right now, there's maybe three emergencies. Why would you think, on this entire planet, that you're one of those three?
I am not O'Brien! I am not O'Brien! I'm not O'Brien! Ask anyone! Jerry?! Jerry?!!
And she slaves to earn every penny. So that someday, I might be able to walk up to a woman and say, "Yes, I'm bald, but I'm still a good person."
So we had a good time... the four of us.
Hey, did I tell you I called one of those girls from the personal ads in The Daily Worker?
You can't - huhu, All right let's go.
And that was wrong, Jerry! You simple must to apologize..
No no no no no, this has to be carefully orchestrated. You go to a fancy dinner, flowers...
So, were talking, and I dont like to go too long before I ask them out, I wanna get it over with right away, so I just blurt out, What are you doing Saturday night?
Kramer was on Murphy Brown? That son of a gun!
Yes! Yes! Everybody has to like me. I must be liked!
Aah, hey. (enthusiastic) If this works out, forget about it. Vacations together, movies together, dinner together. It..it's almost as good as if I didn't get married.
Don't you believe me? It's their fiftieth anniversary. You know this is gonna kill him. You're aware of that. Kill him. On the biggest night of his life...
Let me ask you something. When you go into a store, does it bother you that they make the security guard just stand there all day?
Why? Maybe she liked me. I, I mean she was looking right at me. You know, I think she was impressed. You know, we had good eye contact the whole meeting.
Ah, great, great. (sniffs) What's that smell? Smoke? (walks to the kitchen) Hey everybody, I think I smell some smoke back here...(smoke boils into the doorway.) FIRE! FIRE! Get out of the way!
I see, well, thats open to interpretation. Because so much depends on the layering and the quality of the wetness in the eyes.
ahhhhh (exhaling) Jerry, my young friend, you're so nave. You are so, so nave. You know about a few things. You know about comedy, a little bit about relationships, some baseball, but you are so far out of your element here, you are embarrassing yourself. Now listen to me. I'm negotiating. Negotiation, this is what'cha do in business.
(Laughs, snorts) I said, I said 'Get outta here! No story? Is that what I said?'
When Lupe makes up the beds in the morning.
She called my office. She said shes been in the Hamptons since Sunday. She didnt know if I was trying to get in touch with her. Her machine broke, and shes been using her old machine and she doesnt have the beeper for it.
I thought I saw something fly over here...
Danielle. Where's Neil? (indicating the bed) Is this him?
(going into the bathroom) Well, you on all fours, that thing vibratin', kickin' up sawdust, ho ho! She'll get the picture!
Had to come in and maybe well get together? Had to and maybe?
Assistant to the travelling secretary. (fishing for a reaction) I'm uh, working on the project.
Yeah. I did some shopping. Some new clothes shopping. (turns to a man) Can I borrow your menu?
Well, you know... the friend meeting the new woman. I feel like I'm getting fixed up for a friendship.
They should call it round tine. You know what I'm talking about.
No, no, no, no, Im It. I win.
I know, swan dives from twenty floors up, lands right on top. What do I got a bulls eye up there? He couldn't move over two feet? Land on the sidewalk. It's city property.
Well you know there is an unusual number of people in this country having sex with AMPUTEES! (grabs the forum from Kramer and walks over to the clerk) . . . Penthouse forum, newspaper, gum, Clark Bar.
She's not there. She left. She must've waited and left because those people wouldn't get off the phone.
Yeah. I love Hampton tomatoes. You know, you can eat 'em like apples. You know it's funny, the tomato never really took on as a hand fruit.
(to Jerry) What do you mean by that?
Oh, my God, No, oh my God, . . . Jerry!
...meet the Mets. Come on in and greet the Mets.
I'm, uh, George Costanza. I was having dinner with your son.
(Not sure what the answer should be) What do you want to hear?
Yeah, Jimmy why don't you wait outside, you know, play with something.
A woman that hates me this much comes along once in a lifetime.
All right, listen, I'll see you guys later.
Did you here that? I can't believe this he's eating his sandwich.
No, no, not really. Ever since Susan passed on, I have good days and bad. (Turns the briefcase towards the woman on his left.) Some days, I'm haunted by one word - why. Why Susan? Why wasn't it me licking those invitations? Why am I still here? Well, I gotta run. (Gets up and leaves the meeting.)
Hey. You know, do I have a case for you guys to do on L.A. Law.
Lot of good ones. I don't even want to mention anyone because I'm afraid I'm going to leave somebody out.
You don't think you can buy the ticket yourself...? No, there, there...you sit, and I'll purchase the ticket for you.
If my parents had a mantel, I might be a completely different person.
You got a line in the Woody Allen movie?
So the Wig master.......the Wig master said you could stop by the theater tonight.. and he'll show you around.
(urgent) Mr Wilhelm, listen. You've been abducted! Please, Mr Wilhelm, you gotta listen to me!
You know, if it was a regular salad I wouldn't have said anything. But you had to have the BIG SALAD.
No, I was just wondering... if you guys, uh, had any gum.
I DON'T KNOW. It's this place. I'm very uncomfortable here.
Yeah. Where's he taking you, by the way?
Wait a minute, wait a minute. You can't say anything. (rushes to take phone from Jerry)
No. And he's not a pig-man is he?
This is dating , you can't leave anything to chance.
Yeah, of course she did. That's all I ever heard growing up is 'Why can't you be more like Lloyd Braun?' Did you know he was in a mental institution?
Her roommate. I've driven women to lesbianism before but never to a mental institution.
You know, a muffin can be very filling.
Oh, these are my friends, Elaine and Jerry, ... Noel
Dad, the hinges are all rusted here. That's why the wind keeps blowing the door off.
Dad, that other car cut us off! They had swastikas all over it... They were hurling racial epiphates at us... I could have been killed!
Hey, a "hit" is a totally different story.
Because great couples always have a great story about how they met. That's why I've never been in a long term relationship. I've never had a good meeting story.
They made me buy it.. A hundred bucks this thing cost me. (Gesturing to the book) How dare they?! I got news for you, if it wasn't for the toilet, there would be no books.
When I asked him if it was cancer, he didn't give me a "get outta here". That's what I wanted to hear "Cancer? Get outta here?"
Is that so? Or could it be that you're just a *little* bit worried that you may have missed the boat?
No, no, I don't think I'm special. My mother always said I'm not special.
( mouth full) Hi, this is fantastic ( puts the pit in the a plate)D'you ever had a Macanaw peach?
Um, you know Im starting to think that maybe lobster isnt the way to go.
I suppose he's an attractive man, I ,
(Even more nervous than before) Oh, the, uh, the cabin.. well, (Clears throat)
Ohh, I have tremendous respect for people who work with feet. I mean, to dedicate yourself to the foot - you're toiling in virtual anonymity. I mean..
I know enough to stay away from it.
I have to say, as a glasses wearer I take exception to that. That's like me buying a wheelchair to cruise around in.
Gee, Kramer, I uh...I don't know what to say.
(chases after her) Wait a minute! You're--now you're getting a divorce because she's from Long Island?!?!
I had no Idea you were filled with such....sexuality..
I cant believe how easy it is. Im virtually Orthodox. All I have to do is read a few books, memorize a few prayers, and Im in the club.
Not with that big glass window looking out into the hall. I'd love a good nap. That's the only thing getting me out of bed in the morning. I'll see ya'.
You know, anything in the, in the lip area is good.
Cmon. Wilkinsons got millions invested in this stock. Its gone up three points since Ive been watching it.
(Yelling out, frustrated. The camera spins from a top angle) Twwwwiiiiiixxxxx!
Oh no no no, they don't want to join us.
Ewings hurt? How long is he going to be out?
Oh no - I'm so sorry, it's the Moops. The correct answer is the Moops.
Oh, I'm goin' baby. I'm goin.' (Heads for the door, then stops.) It's Jerry's fault. He took out all my good lines. He's such a control freak!
She cant even afford to go out to lunch. She's been eating in a high school cafeterias She pretends to be a teacher. It's pathetic.
It's impossible. I got him a wake up service.
I thought the thing you said about the sex not being simulated . That was really funny.
Well bear in mind that I am in the smaller office.
Alright, whatever! Now. Whatever caused the damage...(drops a tiny briefcase onto the table in the model)...was jarring enough to completely stop the tape.
(Sarcastic) Maybe for her new performance piece she'll give birth on stage.
You know what? I can't do this. I can't read books anymore; books on tape have ruined me, Jerry. I need that nice voice. This book has *my* voice. I hate my voice.
(smitten) Audrey? My god, you look incredible! I can't believe it!
And this is the first you're seeing of the coat?
Aw, come on. I wanna go see him.
How's her handshake? A little firm, isn't it? Maybe a little too firm?
(wondering) Maybe he doesn't. Maybe he and I are exactly the same, except for one minor, yet crucial, detail. You never know.
(sensing his chance) Well, they do now. Neighborhood's changing.
Well, I think you should drop him down to Step Two.
I love these people, you can't ask 'em questions. (getting excited) They're so mentally gifted that we mustn't disturb the delicate genius unless it's in the confines of an office. (worked up) When huge sums of money are involved, then the delicate genius can be disturbed!
Thats it! Thats it! I cant take it. I cant take it anymore! You stole the statue! Youre a theif! Youre a liar!
What, ... you are making some wisecracks in a night club... wo wo wo. The guy was in game SIX two runs down two outs facing elimination.
Uh-huh. And how much does the healer charge?
Hennigans. I was there sitting in the office and the cleaning woman comes in. I've always been attracted to cleaning women. Cleaning women, chambermaids.
(pleasant surprise) Really? (admonishing) You know Gary, I really have to say, I'm a little bit hurt that you didn't decide to confide in me.
Oh, well, he was probably just getting anxious to start his vacation.
I was throwing up all night. It was like my own personal Crying Game.
Could there be a native p0roblem in the Caymans? Maybe theres native unrest.
(Shocked) She's pregnant? Leslie is pregnant?! Oh, see, there is no justice.
(into phone, frantic) Mister Dalrimple! Mister Dalrimple I have to talk to you!
I've just met her but I'm very impressed.
Oh, this is my friend, Jerry Seinfeld. I just bumped into him around the corner. Isnt that a coincidence? The funny thing is, I see him all the time.
Listen, Buck, I uh...obviously I don't need to talk to you about the importance of player morale, but uh...I've been talking to some of the guys, and some of them - I don't want to mention any names - but some of them...they're not too happy with the polyester uniforms.
So, he's keeping the apartment. He doesn't deserve it, though! Even if he did suffer, that was, like, 40 years ago! What has he been doing lately?! I've been suffering for the past 30 years up to and including yesterday!
What are you comparing yourself to Keith Hernandez. The guys a baseball player Jerry, Baseball!
So they're flying the tiny instruments in from El Paso.
So I lugged that table. That big heavy massage table all the way down to the cab! You ever seen one of those things?
Well? (Miranda hits George) I was just - I'm curious, that's all. We, uh. We'd like you to, do everything possible.
Well, it's just a game. Remember that, kids.
(getting up out of his chair to get out of the Mohel's way) No, No.
Yeah, well I'm thinking about getting out of town with Susan for a few days....Her parents rebuilt the cabin!
The next thing you know, he'll have you driving him to the airport..
Perhaps. (hehe) I walk in, everything is organized -- messages, appointments. And I can't tell you how proud I am of myself for going with Ade.
So, you want to come down to Mario's Pizza with me and help me pick up the Frogger?
How would you like a 'Hare Krishna' fist on your throat, you little punk?
What the hell are you two talking about? (All exit)
(Once again, still on the shower) Could it be lukewarm?
Okay, okay. Look, you do all the talking, okay?
I think. (Pause as they all look down)
Hey. How come I didn't get a Christmas card? Everybody else got one. Jerry got one, Kramer got one. I thought we were good friends. I don't get a Christmas card. I don't get it.
Beautiful lineswoman. Alright listen uh I'm going to go to the concession stand and get some real sunblock. You want anything? Jerry? (Jerry is staring at the lineswoman) Jerry?
Really? I thought you and Celia were sleeping together?
If anything happens here, can I count on you?
OK Look, the gum isn't cutting it for me. We need to be about something else...anything..please.
Alright. I guess I just have to pick myself up, dust myself off, and throw myself right back down again!
I never heard him say anything really funny.
Yes, well, you know, Im not thinking about the price. You know youre the only woman Ive never thought about the price. Get the lobster. I beg you to get the lobster. Go for the lobster.
Elaine, get something! Its all taken care of.
That's... what we used to call him in high school, the exterminator. He's a linebacker. Oh, did we have some wild times.
(on phone) . It's George Costanza. . are there any messages for me? Why does Mr. Steinbrenner want to see me in his office? . . . Communist? I'm not a Communist . . . . All right, all right. All right, I'll be there. - ( hangs up ) My secretary Ada, told Mr Steinbrenner I'm a Communist Now he wants to see me in his office.
Well what if I told you I'm thinking of moving here?
Yeah. Actually it was in gym class. I was trying to climb the ropes and Jerry was spotting me. I kept slipping and burning my thighs and then finally I slipped and fell on Jerry's head. We've been close ever since.
I love it! This is fantastic! Look at this couch, is this velvet?!
A drafty apartment? A... sweaterless friend? A ball-game giveaway Metlife windbreaker?
Is that the guy who likes fat women?
Was this something you had planned for a while?
I'm just happy to be working with your talented son...
How many people does he do that for?
I want to know how did that get into my car?
(opening door) It's a big night. I'm, uh, ice skating with one, and going to a staged reading of "Godspell" with the other.
Na no, I'm not good in these situations. I can't hide my pity. I..I make em feel worse.
(Asking Elaine) Jerry seem a little weird when I mentioned Nina?
I'm going out with her tomorrow, she said she had some errands to run.
He knows this guy, Wilkinson. He made a fortune in the stock market. Now hes got some new thing. You know, theres supposed to be a big merger. He wasnt even supposed to say anything. You guys should think about doing this too.
(broaching a subject) Hey mom. What kind of woman was grandma?
Yes of course go ahead. My guess is you're going to like this very much.
(scoffs) Those unions. (sighs) Okay. Sports,...movies. What about a talk show host?
No, but um I have very good report with women, very good, comfortable. And from the first time I laid eyes on a brassieres, I was enthralled.
I know they're in there, the three of them, laughing at me. Together, laughing and lying.
You don't work in the rain? Your a mailman."Neither rain nor sleet nor snow....."It's the first one.
You know, sometimes those guys don't make it back. (Looks in fridge) I'm really hungry.
Then afterwards maybe we could all go out together. Y'know she'll see me with my friends, she'll observe me as I really am, as myself. Maybe I can get some hand that way.
Well, I'm still here. You took out the other guy!
This car out there is taking up, like, three parking spaces.
Kramer, trust me, this is the best bathroom in midtown!
Those birthdays. I told you. They're relationship killers. If a relationship is having any problems whatsoever, a birthday will always bring it out.
I'm not gonna give you my card unless you tell me what it's for!
My card won't work there; they're not on the Plus system.
You can't leave! This is an ambulance! This is an emergency!
No, they're not funny at all. No, I have no funny friends. I'm the funny one. El Clowno.
Alright. Uh, well, I'm out of here. (Gets up to leave)
Now, this is the basic layout for Mario's Pizza.
Would you get out of here. Who's gonna turn down a chair? I would be very interested to know how he felt about all of this. Maybe I'll have a talk with him.
Eh eh eh, can't do it, can't do it, sorry, I got a date.
What are you? A *baby*!? All right. Tell her.
(harassed) Are you aware that I'm being charged for Tuesday's appointment? I had to take my mother to the chiropodist.
If I see things as they are, I would ask 'why' or 'why not?'
Okay. (Chewing) Thanks anyway. (Continues to chew as he exits)
What's going on? He still wants to have dinner with us?
You think your parents would have any objections to taking a little kid to Paris with them? (Jerry looks at him confused) It turns out that the kid's father lives in Paris. (chuckling) Is that a coincidence? (Jerry smilies) Eh you know Alec wants me to take him over there so I figure as long as they're going (claps)
I dont know, 120, 130Then they sent some guys to sandblast for 6 hours. Tomorrow they are putting in asbestos.
No, not nervous. I'm good, very good. (A beat, then he snaps) I can't do this! Can't do this!
That's it? You don't have to screw it in or anything?
What's to think about? If Putty says it's what it is, it's what it is. He's not gonna cheat you.
40? I'm payin' 60 to my maid. She doesn't do laundry and I'm gettin' nothin'. All right. Once she pinched my ass, but I don't know what that was.
The wedding is off. Now you can go to the Super Bowl.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. But then, I said to him, 'Oh yeah? Well, the jerk store called, and they're running outta you.'
(Mr.Wilhelm comes in and hears George yelling) You tell that son of a bitch no Yankee is ever comin' to Houston! Not as long as you bastards are running things!
Why? Did she say something to you about why she broke up with me?
Love to! (Cracks his knuckles, then winces under the pain)
I cant. I met them. Theyre devout. You know, in the cab on the way over here, I actually thought about converting.
What do you mean? The engagement is off, we get the TV back. That's business.
Uh, Carol, can I talk to you for a second? Right now?
You would think that at the end of the week when they hand out the checks, throw in a few soaps.
I don't care. Look, Lloyd doesn't know what he's up against. This is nothing to me. (moving his arm) My whole life is a lie.
And I am not a piece of toast.
Good afternoon. One large crab bisque to go. Bread. Beautiful.
Yeah, no pop-in, no "in the neighborhood," no "I saw your light was on." And the best part is, if things go really well...
Funny, cause I happen to be very good friends with Keith Hernandez.
I tell you, I really don't think so-called relationship humor is what this show is all about.
He got about uh, two inches from... there.
I've seen squeeze mustard. I've never seen squeeze ketchup.
(surprising his parents in the kitchen) Welcome back.
Oh really. You tell her you shaved it?
(Reflecting on his life gone wrong) This McKigney guy had a few good years.. (To Kramer, bitter) How could you forget to turn off an iron?
Yeah. (Points to two open seats in front of Jerry's. To Nina) Sit down there. (Sees Jerry in the crowd) Hello, Jerry. (Obviously angered at Jerry) I believe you know Nina.
Oh, sure. I mean, after all, you were almost my, uh... OK, I gotta go.
It never ends, this present stuff! Engagement present! Then they get married, you gonna have to get them something for that! Then the baby, there's another present. Then the baby starts getting their presents. I don't even like Drake.
What about these two? Aren't they gonna chip in?
Ow! What are you doing under there? Hey, stop that! Don't eat that! That's not food! (to Robin) He's suckin' down Equal packets!
In this scene my co-star who's right over here ( goes over to George who is still on the phone) Follow meeeee... is George Costanza, he plays an airline pilot who's just returned from Rome and I'm about to show him how much I've missed him.
(Loud, so everyone at the wedding can hear) You slept with the groom?!
You know, Jason, I, uh, I couldn't help notice, I... I didn't get my apology.
Well, I wouldn't want you to do that. You know there's a lot of losers out there.
(hearing Elaine over the phone) What, she's out?
He's giving you furniture? Who is this guy?
We haven't heard his notes yet, we don't know how he feels about our work. (Russell throws up yet again.)
She happens to be very good friends with her.
Nevertheless.. I was wondering if you and your .friends are doing business here at the Jiffy Park.... You know ..hum What do you people call it? Turning tricks? Anyway I...I....found a condom in my car....and I'm not saying it's yours but.... I want to know if I should just change parking lots.
So what? Ill start talking to him, you know, casual, and Ill work my way around to it.
I am eating my dessert. How do you eat it, with your hands?
Well... we could dance around it a little first.
(rage) Oh, it's got cachet, baby! It's got cachet up the yin-yang!
Elaine, I once told a woman that I coined the phrase, "Pardon my French."
If anybody should be getting more it's you.
Yes, well, if you had never taken your keys back from Kramer, he never would have taken his back from you and given 'em to me, in which case I wouldn't have had to take mine back from her.
I told you to stop with the hopping.
Hey, you know, there's this secretary at work that always had a crush on me.
Nothing, I... said it was a little problem.
(Annoyed) Yeah, yeah. We'll, uh, let you know.
Get going? But we haven't really, you know....
We did a crossword puzzle together, *in bed*. It was the most fun I ever had in my entire life. Did you hear me? in my *life*! Y'know?
(thinking) Oh my God, it's 701. What have I done? My whole plan is depending on Kramer? Have I learned nothing? How could I make such a stupid mistake? He'll never show up!
I have an aunt that died at seven.
They will get a good home won't they?
Yeah. Just take 'em out and ride 'em around for about..half an hour.
You see if I stay the whole year, I get it all.
C'mon, c'mon...(stands up and physically rolls Betsy to the left side of the couch.) See, now, is that so bad?
51 people?! That's it?! I thought it was, like, a thousand!
An eye job? Ma, you don't need an eye job.
What did I get the veggie burger for? You got a veggie burger, so I had to get the veggie burger, I'm allover crums...
Listen, maybe we shouldn't start writing today. I got a lot on my mind.
Yeah well, they won't know. I got the car there.
All right. All right. Let's not get into panic mode! Let's not make a big deal outta this thing or we're never gonna get through this night.
he's the first cool guy I've ever been friends with in my whole life. You know.. it's a different world when you're with a cool guy, he's not afraid of anybody. You should hear the way he talks to waitresses.. he gets free pie!
They're selling coffee, bran muffins.. you're surrounded by reading material. It's entrapment!
Would you mind helping me out with some of this stuff?!?
C-Communist? I am a Yankee, sir, first and foremost.
Flying him in? How longs he staying for?
I don't want to! I'm outta money! I got 714 dollars left in the bank.
Gary? Well, well, well well. Where the hell've you been? I've been leaving you phone messages for months.
Alright, still her father didn't have to throw me out like that, he could have just asked me to leave. The guy had me in a headlock! Susan's not going tonight you know.
Or maybe, she just wanted to go to the Tony's. I tell you what; you ask her out again. No Tony, just Jerry. That way you know it he was her dude or just some dude.
Me either. Is there anything you can do to shut them up?
Oh, no no no no. Go ahead, Pop, you always knew your cars.
He's with the touring company of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. He's the guy in charge of the wigs.
I'm going to a poetry reading with PATRICE First time poets, in a burnt out building, down by the docks, Supposed to be good.
I was jumping over a puddle, and for some reason I went like this. (George stretches out his arms in a ballet motion) And they called me a Mary. So I chased them, and I tripped and I fell.
(Gestures for Kramer to shut up) Once again, Antonio, I can't even begin to say how deeply, deeply sorry I am about everything. The job, the cat.. (A lamp breaks) the lamp.
You know what word Susan used last night? Hnuh. Vault! hu,
I think Play Now is putting something in my food.
(to the cab driver) Excuse me, do you see anything on my lip here?
I, I couldnt wait. I was too anxious to see you.
Anyway, I-I would like to-to pay for the cleaning.
Those are my friends I was telling you about. We're gonna talk to them, pull over.
Is it flowing? I like flowing, cascading hair. Thick lustrous hair is very important to me.
If I could talk to the guy for just a sec...
I would give anything to be going up those stairs again.
Well, I'll tell you, Stacey. It's a lot of hard work. But, it comes fairly easy to me. Some people write symphonies. This is my gift. (Raises ski lift ticket while Stacey looks away)
Phil, I loved those cigars! Incoming! (Flicks his card tward Phil)
. . .uh, . . . wait a second. Are you suggesting that I went out of my way to tell Elaine that even though you handed her the big salad, that it came from me?
We'll ask him. (opens partition) My dear fellow, where are you dropping us?
All right we got the wine. Aren't we lucky? We got wine. Whoopee Whoa! Imagine if we didn't bring the wine. We'd be shunned by society. Outcasts! WHERE'S YOUR WINE? GET OUT!
Let me ask you something. What do you do for a living, Newman?
(still quiet) Never mind, never mind. I need you to do me a favour. Uhm, remember what we were talking about at the coffee shop earlier?
I will never understand the bathrooms in this country. Why is it that the doors on the stalls do not come all the way down to the floor?
Well at least you accomplished something. You got fish.
You gotta look at this. I pulled it in perfectly equidistant from the car in front of me and the car behind me.
I just popped in now. I'm a big pop-in guy.
You see this is the thing. . . . (crying) I just feel . . . mumble, cry, mumble, . . . I'm scared. You and I together, (cry)
I dont know whatcha had to tell her that for. You put me in a very difficult position, Marine Biologist! I'm very uncomfortable with this whole thing.
No, but I can tell she's going to. I can sense it. We had this terrible phone conversation. I was so nervous before I called I made up this whole list of things to talk about.
Because if there's any doubt at all I...I feel we should cultivate it.
Ya-see, how could this not have any fat? It's too good.
Hey Deena, come on, give us a hug. (they hug) Oh my gosh, you look as pretty as you did back in high school.
Well, I was very comfortable! I've got my nuts here...
Well... what if you showed up bad naked, huh? You still got that belt sander?
We were expecting about two hundred people...Well...Thank you , thank you.
Yeah.( reaches for the purse and finds a piece of paper . he looks annoyed.
(Stern, angered) I hope so. (Takes the scissors)
My face! My face! Get me to the hospital!
I'd love to be a Civil War buff. ... What do you have to do to be a buff
My name is George. I'm unemployed and I live with my parents.
There are some people in this room who would have been very happy to never see this briefcase again. There are people in this room who think they can destroy other people's property and get away with it. Well, let me tell you something about those people. They weren't counting on this brain! And this tape recorder.
Its a Twix! Theyre all Twix! It was a setup! A setup, I tell ya! And youve robbed it! Youve all screwed me again! Now, gimme one! Gimme a Twix!
Really? (Jerry shakes his head) Maybe this will become like a cool thing, living with your parents.
You don't have to pay for the massage?
(Threatening) Hold it! One more step and were walkin!
so, uh, Steven.. I see you're president of the chess club.
It's standard. Has she left you one of those messages where she uses up the whole machine?
There was something so reassuring about that cozy little space.
All right. You wanna know what one of her favorite expressions is? Happy, Pappy?
A man gave me... a massage. hu, hu
(defensive) So what? So what if I do?
Yeah. The thing is, I, uh...I had this little zinger of my own I wanted to try.
(Frantically, takes phone and screams...) He'll call you back.
Well, I'm doing it, Jerry. I'm buying the Frogger machine. Now the torch will burn forever.
That reminds me, I'm not getting you guys any more fruit. That guy was eyeballing me the whole time. He gave me the creeps. All right, you owe me twenty-eight sixty.
Algae, obviously plankton, hmhm. I don't know what else I could tell ya, ah, Oh I-I just got back from a trip to the Galapagos Islands, I was living with the turtles.
These old guys, they're up at 4 a.m., by two thirty they're wiped. (animated) How did we get back onto you?!
Pauline? . . . Wait a minute. I got it. My brother once impregnated a woman named Pauline.
Whatcha got there, the 4-volt? Heh, I did you a favor.
uh.. maana? huh maana might.. huh maana might be a problem, I'm supposed to have huh a boil lanced maana. Huh you know I think they charge me if I cancel with only one maana's notice
Aw, well, you know, it's your anniversary. It's - it's the least I can do. I - I just want you guys to go out and have a good time. Ha ha. So, you think we should, uh, we should get downstairs?
You ditched me. That's twice. Now I demand to know what's going on!
Well, you know. You get to a certain point, you wanna know about your roots.
Well, it always has to be explained to me, and then I have to have someone explain the explanation.
Maybe I need someone who doesn't speak English.
(glances upwards) Yeah. Uhm, why did she die so young?
Will I call you when I get home? ha ha What do you think? ee, you kill me kill me
Ma, will you stop?... Its just a statue!... How is it my fault?!... It was stolen. I didnt even touch it this time... Okay, fine... I dont see why this should affect to potatoes!... Okay... Goodbye. (George hangs up.) She doesnt react to disappointment very well. Unlike me.
Oh, no no, I cant go back there. Jerry, its so awkward and, you know, it could be dangerous sexually. Something could happen, Id be right back where I started from.
Hey hey hey, we're in a rush here.
(Picking up the ketchup) What typical? Gimme typical. Gimme some typical.
He's a sports writer for the daily news. I find him very insightful...
Well this worked out okay. So are you going to see the police woman?
Hey, people, people, people, people, people. Not bad, huh? Excuse me.
What do I do? Well actually, I'm a writer. In fact, I'm writing a comedy pilot for NBC right now.
Me? It wasn't me I never even saw the ball. All you do is dribble.
Hey, do you know, Bonnie, I just had a pretty wild idea.
You arms look like something hanging in a kosher deli.
You know. You use the, uh...(mutters something unintelligible under his breath.)
Yeah, just tell him to hurry it up.
No I didn't mean to imply that you did. You're obviously a very well proportioned individual. I was just wondering, have they ever offered you a chair?
Oh, this is good. This Kruger guy is clueless. I can't wait to work for him.
Nothing really, you know...just eh, stroll around the cell blocks, maybe eh, take in a shower fight. (chuckles.) Hey eh, you know you got a bounced check hanging up in the little market over on Columbus?
What's so hard about that? How am I supposed to get it in there? I can't just walk in with it. I have to get the Rosses out of the apartment!
(embarrassed/self-conscious about his gut) Do I? Thanks.. You too..
(to Kramer) This man is a genius. Genius!
How could you not know who Bozo the Clown is?
We just came from Chadway's(?) What's going on.
What are you, Crazy? I can't ask the guy for more cigars after you burned down his cabin!
Of course I mean that. I am incapable of guile.
How could anybody be so selfish and inconsiderate!
I don't see why's she more self-conscious about that than her toe thumbs.
I was doing standup comedy in Kennebunkport Maine. ??? night club. The stage was on a cliff and the audience was throwing all the comics off.
They always make me take stock of my life. And how Ive pretty much wasted all of it, and how I plan to continue wasting it.
Yeah, is he still mad at you for crashing his Thanksgiving party?
Just take it off. I'm getting hot just looking at it.
Jerry! I need you to get another picture of man-hands. I'm beggin' you!
That's a lot of pressure. Make love to me. What am I, in the circus? What if I can't deliver?
You know, suddenly I'm in the mood for pasta primavera myself. (Jerry nudges George to sneak a peek at Molly's cleavage as she bends over and looks in her backpack. Jerry has a quick look, but George stares, hypnotized. Russell comes up behind George.)
I noticed you eh, chose the eh "clowns with balloons" check design.
Yeah, it's being framed right now. I don't even know what it costs. (beat) Not, uh, too expensive, is it?
(proffering glasses) I hope prune juice is alright. It's the only thing I had that was chilled.
(yells) Wow! Who put this cup right on the new table!
Hey, Nina! (beat) I owe you some money, don't I?
Because I'm REFRESHED. I finally found a way to sleep in my office. Under the desk. I lie on my back. I tuck in the chair. I'm invisible.
(emerging from bathroom, buttoning his shirt) A gymnast! I can't believe it, you didn't tell me she was a gymnast.
As you care for me. Which is why it is very important that you never breathe a word of this to anyone about the... you know. What, with Clarence Thomas and everything.
You know that coat was Gore-Tex. Its worth a hell of a lot more than that, cheap Chardonnay.
Yeah, the super glossy. The best they had.
Would you wait a second? Just wait? (They fight over it.)
Yeah, "duty". Do you know how much duty is?
Wait a second, wait. Why are we together?
So Anyway, I started to compliment Elaine on her sketches and it turns out,they're Paula's.
(singing) Master of the house/Doling out the charm/Ready with a handshake and an open...
No! I'm not gonna do that! That's one step away from personal ads! And prostitutes! No! No, I am not going down that road! What does she look like?
I change I change. Two weeks ago I tried a soft boiled egg. Never liked it before. Now I'm dunkin a piece of toast in there and I'm loving it.
I don't know what you're getting all riled up about. There are probably a million Costanzas-
I believe that I am about to become the target of a systematic process of intimidation and manipulation, the likes of which you have never -
(shouts) Wait! Yes! That's what I should've said! (frustration) D'ohh!
(signs) Sorry. (expectant) You're sure, uh, there isn't anything else?
Na....no ... This relationship he..he..has got to be about something and fast or I'm in very serious and weird trouble....hum What else happened?
All I know is I've been going to doctors all my life. What has it gotten me? I'm thirty-three years old. I haven't outgrown the problems of puberty, I'm already facing the problems of old age. I completely skipped healthy adulthood. I went from having orgasms immediately to taking forever. You could do your taxes in the time it takes me to have an orgasm. I've never had a normal, medium orgasm.
I know the D is the biggest. I've based my whole life on knowing that the D is the biggest.
I understand you offer a 50%-off 'bereavement' fare...?
So, you... you say you've been in the city all winter?
[realizing the only way out is to show the stub] I've got the stub.
Stay back! (Runs out of the room, pushing Jerry out ahead of him)
See, look at this. (wearing a very tight shirt) Rachel, my T-shirt shrunk. It used to be much bigger, and now it shrunk. You see, that's what water does. It shrinks things.
Unbelievable, I'm never gonna get out of here. The guy goes to pee, he never comes back. It's like a science fiction story.
Not as good. That's when you realize all the money you're losing.
Oh they'll get out of the way. You really smell banana?
Between the car getting totalled, the towing charge and the fine, there's no way I can ever pay him back...
Oh, the nose job. I don't know, what did you think?
I know. It's Mickey Mantle's number. So not only is it an all around beautiful name, it is also a living tribute.
How are we gonna get out of here? They'll kill us!
I don't even drink wine. I drink Pepsi.
Oh... (George looks around and sees the chef hiding behind a plant it's Bob!)
No, you're gonna sit down, you son of a gun...
Hey, she wants me to dress uh "smart casual." What uh, what is that?
You're fresh (grabs her arm) You're very fresh. You seem very fresh to me. You're very vital. I couldn't take you any fresher.
That's David Letterman. I just saw David Letterman walk by. I'll be right back. (He exits)
Jerry, could you excuse us for a few minutes, please?
(looking uncomfortable) Um... yeah! Sure, sure I'm interested.
(Not wanting to make Elaine mad) I guess it's not important.
Squirrel? Well, we have no deal with THEM!
Yeah. Eric the Clown put it out with his big shoe.
You're not really gonna go to California, are you?
Loves bald? (laughs) Wow. Who uh, who is she?
Oh, I'll pay. Half-price. Arrivederci my fellow 40-short.
It's, uh, it's not a little chicken. (laughing) Little chicken. It's a gamebird.
They could kick me out of the health club if he tells them!
So, if I may jump ahead - you're gonna take dog medicine?
If there's any doubt, I do a leave-behind. Keys, gloves, scarf -- I go back to her place to pick it up...(pop sound) date number two.
Well, maybe she decided to celebrate her birthday on the Monday after the weekend.
(worried) Yeah, that's right. What if it's a genetic thing, like father like son?
Ok uh, I guess I'll tell them that.
Isn't polite to say Hello when somebody says hello?
I'm a man. Jerry, I'm a man. And do you know why? It's because of that talk we had. You were my inspiration. Do you believe it? You. That lunch was the defining moment of my life.
How could you be a doctor and not say "get outta here"? It should be part of the training at medical school "Cancer? Get outta here!" "Go home! What are you crazy? It's a little test. It's nothing. You're a real nut. You know that?" (Jerry gives him half of his sandwich to hopefully shut him up) I told you that God would never let me be successful. I never should've written that pilot. Now the show will be a big hit, we'll make millions of dollars, and I'll be dead. Dead Jerry. Because of this. (showing his lip)
I don't know, she lives right around the corner. You could take it here or go to the coffee shop.
I dont know. Just start scratching. Tell him you have the crabs. He was in the military. Hell understand that.
You don't understand. A garage. I can't even pull in there. It's like going to a prostitute. Why should I pay, when if I apply myself, maybe I could get it for free? (he hears a horn honking) What? What do you want? Go around me, I'm looking for spaces.
Kramer, I, I, I, uh, I need to talk to Jerry privately.
What are you doing here, I though you were going to the airport.
The catering hall screwed up. The wedding is delayed until June. It's like a stay of execution.
Oh, you know what you're like? You're like a pathetic gambler. You're one of those losers in Las Vegas who keeps thinking he's gonna come up with a way to win at blackjack.
Well, I don't see why if you have his, he should have yours.
Alright, lets get in there. Quick, quick, quick...
All right. So, what theatre you wanna go to tonight? We got 61st and 3rd or 84th and Broadway.
Oh, well th-that's great. It's really great. Hm hm mm.
I think I may be in love with this woman.
We're on the Grand Central, there's no traffic.
Those were her exact words, I like George.
Well it's not my fault. Seinfeld can't drive. How hard is it to follow somebody?
You think she thinks I have a beautiful face, or is she just saying that?
I told her we'd all go out afterwards, okay? And don't applaud when she stops playing the first time. It's not over yet.
Oh, boy I was up to four in the morning watching the Omen trilogy.
(Definite) I'll take it in my room. (Walks off)
"Jerry", oh my God. He wants to talk about "Jerry"?
Uh, yes, uh...you don't know me, my name is George Costanza...did you happen to rent Breakfast At Tiffany's?
Absolutely. Because instead of doing a wash, I just keep buying underwear. My goal is to have over three hundred and sixty pair. That way, I only have to do wash once a year.
Say it's Saturday night in Spain. They go out dancing. You think they do the flamenco?
Do you realize in the entire history of western civilization no one has successfully accomplished the Roommate Switch? In the Middle Ages you could get locked up for even suggesting it!
(Takes a few seconds to mull this one over. Shooting Jerry a confused look, he repeats it) "The panties your mother laid out for you"? (Jerry nods) What does that mean?
Excuse me, are you gonna be very long?
I used to share that same outlook. But now, I have so many things to occupy my mind. For instance, the atom.
You know what? it's better than Elaine's, too. I gotta give her a call. (Moves tward the phone)
(To Jane) You know, when I was a kid, I once found a dollar and fifty cents in change on the bottom of the pool.
(annoyed) Hes an importer/exporter, okay? (beat) Elaine ever call you back?
I'm sure I have a low IQ. I've been lying about my SAT scores for 15 years.
That's right. He just happened to be the previous owner of the vehicle.
You should see what my father used to go through before he bought a car. He'd go from state to state. He was away for weeks at a time. It was like he was running for President and he was going through the primaries. We'd get phone calls from motels in New Hampshire.
Yeah, yeah I really had some guts back then. Why don't we do it again?
Well, I was buttering myself up for a nice shave --
Jay Crespi, how am I gonna forget Jay Crespi?
(Let down) Yeah, but you - you promised it to me.
(Still holding the note) I think I'm having a heart attack.
I think he was trying to tell me something, like it had some sort of a meaning.
Well, you should always consider podiatry. (Patting Ricky on the shoulder) There's nothing wrong with the feet. (Ricky looks critically back at George)
Me run in? Why don't you run in?
Okay. (They walk around each other.) OK. Ill choose you. Whaddaya want?
What do the Chinese have to gain by faking a cure for baldness?
Ovaltine. Have you ever had this stuff? Why is it called Ovaltine?
Uh, we're cool. Everything's cool (to security attendent)
They talk back. They go, "Hey George, how's it going?" I say, "Get the hell out of here!"
Mulva! (again pointing finger at Jerry -- Kramer watches the exchange back and forth)
Well, it worked when I met George Peppard last week.
Listen. I want you guys to send along those agreements the minute you land. Our boys can't wait to kick your butts!
I can do hard time for this one. And community service!
No, he said there was nothing he could do, and next time I should probably break the Prozacs in half.
"Yeah,yeah yeah yeah! I've seen these.....they sorta ..they make your legs..stronger."
Ladies. I, uh, I haven't seen this before.
She called. He yelled Cartwright. I missed her.
(whispering) I can't explain. It's very important that I sit here.
Yeah, Like I don't know that I'm pathetic.
You should be the one criticizing me. I, I'm lucky to even know someone like you.
She's leaving me dirty messages on my answering machine.
So what? Somebody dropped an egg on my head as I went into my building last night.
I had to listen to a five minute discussion on which one is actually called shmoopy.
Yeah, it's bizarre. (they both look around them suspiciously)
What idea? I just said something. I didn't know you were going to listen to me.
You got less than sixty seconds. That's like dismantling a time bomb. What got into you?
Carol, thats so rude. Please, Im serious, just for a moment, if you wouldnt mind. And then well talk to Jerry.
I think that's Mr. Hayman. ...The gym teacher from our High School.
Just dropped in for a visit. You, uh, you never called me back.
No! No! Turn it off! No feats of strength! (Gets up and starts running out of the coffee shop) I hate Festivus!
Oh, yes I am. Mr. Thomassoulo likes to play dirty. Well, theres nothing dirtier than a giant ball of oil.
Never mind. The're done. All I have to do now is redo them. You know if you take everything I've ever done in my entire life and condense it down into one day, it looks decent.
Im starving. You got any of those free donuts you use to soften people up?
Oh, gotta get fifty. Gotta get fifty. All right, I tell you what. We go to the coffee shop, you call your manager. Maybe they made an offer.
Kramer goes to a fantasy camp. His whole life is a fantasy camp. People should plunk down two-thousand dollars to live like him for a week. Do nothing, fall ass-backwards into money, mooch food off your neighbors and have sex without dating; that's a fantasy camp.
Oh no, I can't do it. I-I'm not good at these things, I get flustered. Once I tried to bribe an usher at the roller derby, I almost got arrested.
Hello, oh, hello. You remember, ... Susan, from N B C.
(laughing it off and trying too hard) Yeah, yeah. I have a thing for Marisa Tomei. Like she would ever go out with a short, stocky, bald man. (forced laughter) Hu hu, ha ha. Like that's her type. Huh. She's an Oscar winner. (nervous laughter) He heh. Besides, I don't even know her. It's not like anyone's trying to fix us up. Who, who would try and fix me up with Marisa Tomei?
yeah, I ... I snuck a peak. ... But it was so fast I didn't see anything. It was just a blur.
It's all your fault! You and Elaine! All that orgasm talk. She did have an orgasm, she didn't have an orgasm. Orgasm this, orgasm that. I got so focused on it. I started to panic and boom, I lost it. I tried everything, I was talking to him 'Please wake up, do something.'
I can't believe it. Look, that's Jerry Seinfeld.
Well, after dinner last week, she invites me back to her apartment.
I know but I couldn't think of anything else to say to her.
Alright! So, she said, that she could've fixed me up with her.
They got a billion people over there and he found a relative.
Elaine? It's me, George. (Elaine opens the door.) Hey, sorry to bother you so late. (To Billy) Hey! How ya doin.' (To Elaine) Uh, did you get any of those sponges?
They got a new intern from Francis Louis High. His name is Keith. He comes in Mondays after school.
And then I hear this rabbi on television, I mean imagine.
This is amazing. (George gets up to leave and shake's man's hand) Thank you. Thank you very much. . . . I'm going back in! . . . You'll feel better (to woman)
No, I dont want it. I want it, if you dont want it.
What? Every time I leave my house now I have to call everybody I know and ask them if they want to do what I'm doing?
I was in the middle of a conversation.
Wait till you hear this! (George sees Donna and no Jerry.) Whoa, ah, Im sorry, I didnt, I had no idea.
Well you didn't have to say it like that.
(he makes a sign to Jodi to wait and turns to Jerry) Jerry... This woman hates me so much. I'm starting to like her.
That's what I'm afraid of. You know Mr. Steinbrenner, . . .
(still in Jacks voice) I'm working on my Jack Nicholson, You can't handle the truth! (he salutes)
Well, I think you're wrong about that. [Elaine walks past the window again, glancing in] And ah now if you'll excuse me, I'd really like to get started, please.
You think I should come clean? What d'you think, you think I Should confess?
Is-is that what I said 'no story'? Because Jerry had to tell me later.
It is a horrible company. There's no management what so ever. I could go hog wild in there.
There putting in a lost and found because of me. There's a time limit but still.
Oh, she's a Kramer. And uh, while I was there I uh happened to pick up another juicy little nugget about our friend.
[furious] Good. It's good to be accurate like that.
What kind of money you think your parents have?
Yeah. And since you go buy there everyday. I was hoping that we could help each other out.
Jerry Seinfeld. My best friend. He can explain all of this. (calls to Jerry) Jerry.
I think I could be a philanthropist. a kick ass philanthropist! I would have all this money, and people would love me. Then they would come to me.. and beg! And if I felt like it, I would help them out. And then they would owe me big time! (Thinking to himself) .. First thing I'm gonna need is a driver..
No, no, no, this suit is not for sale. (tries to take off the suit from the guy)
He didnt do anything, Jerry. Its a scam! Who told you to do that?
Chamberlind, you could hold his head in nthe toilet, he'd still give you half of Europe.
. . . WELL IT WAS A BIG SALAD. AND WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IS, HOW DOES A PERSON WHO HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE BIG SALAD CLAIM RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT SALAD AND ACCEPT THE THANK YOU UNDER FALSE PRETENSES - AH - AH?
Because of me? You must be joking! Who wouldn't want to live because of me? I'm nothing!
And I didnt even ask her out. She asked me out first. She called me up. What was I supposed to do? Say no? (laughs) I cant do that to someone.
I could never do that. You know the ironic thing is if she had a smaller nose, I never could have gone out with her in the first place. She'd be out of my league with a smaller nose. And I really like her, I know that. And I know one other thing. I'm not getting past that nose.
I can't eat with you leanin' over like this. Just look straight forward.
Yeah, but if you still look closely you can see ah, a little bump where the nose use to be. huhuhuhu.
No one hails a cab like me. My hailing technique is unmatched. I get the wrist going from side to side and boom! Cabs are crashing into themselves to just pick me up. (a cab stops) All right, here we go. Let me get door. Feminists aside, I know women like the door holding. Here we are all righty. O.K. Jodi let's get together again real soon and say hello to your sister for me.
Hey Elaine? Put me down for some of that art. 1,900 dollars worth.
I know it may sound shocking. But, I just can't stop myself from... wanting you.
That's a picture of me next to the coffin.
(Stern) No, ma, I'm not gonna see a psychiatrist. N- I don't care if you do pay for it! No! Discussion over. Yeah, alright, I'll see you later. Yes, of course I'm gonna come by. Alright. (Hangs up, slamming it down on the coffee table. He sits down next to Jerry) My mother wants me to see a psychiatrist now. Why?! Because she caught me? (Scoffs, shaking his head) You know, if everyone who did that had to go see a psychiatrist.. (Laughing, he snorts)
Well, if it doesn't concern me, then I can stay. (Kramer grabs the back of George's chair, drags him out into the hallway and closes the door.)
Damn you, laser guy! You had to grab it all with your lowbrow laser shtick! You're just a prop comic! Where's the craft?!
Well, you see, what happened was...the doctor - the very same doctor that was attending to my late aunt - suffered an untimely stroke, and lost the use of his right hand, so...obviously I was unable to get the death certificate. However, I do have this. (Reaches inside his coat and takes out a Polaroid photo.)
(to Carrie) You know, the thing is, I kinda promised the widow Mantle that I would name my baby Seven.
Once, to a dog. He licked himself and left the room.
So, uh, gentlemen, do we have a deal?
Well, sure Joey, sure, I would be thrilled.
Cmon, go for twenty-five hundred. Well do it together. Come on, come on. Were in it together.
Oh good, good, come in. Come in, welcome. I'm George. And this is Jerry, over there, on the phone, that's Jerry. And you are, um?
A-and don't settle for 145, you can do better, you're a genius. Heheheh (laughs)
Well, I still don't know what I'm supposed to do. I don't even know what my assignment is.
If you don't mind, sir. I'll be here at 8.
(Mocking, skeptic) Yeah, you show us the 900.
Oh sure, sure. You wanna be alone, sure. I understand that, you wanna a little time to think uh thing..ponder things..you know..ruminant..(chuckles) you go ahead, lotta stuff on your mind..you think things out..Think, mull, mull, do a lot of mulling. (short laugh then exits Monk's)
Pardon me, I went to see your friend Dwayne... there was no discount.
Listen to the comeback. (pleased) 'Oh yeah? Well the jerk store called. They're running outta you.'
"It's the Kom Pau ... George likes his chicken spicy."
I need like a bucket of water! I got a car overheating, I got an alarm that won't go off, I'm pressing 'one', I'm pressing 'two', nothing! What do I do?! Help me! Help me!
It's not working, Jerry. It's just not working. (sits down next to Elaine)
I didn't even know Fulton was in the hospital.
We cant just let him get away with this.
No. She tried to give me the "it's not you, it's me" routine.
Yes! I mean, if she thinks that's me she's under a complete misapprehension. That was not me, Jerry. That was not me.
I had to give it to the liquor store guy.
She told this couple she had an affair with a matador.
Nah, I have asthma. (Robin's kid grabs George's leg from under the table, and George struggles.)
Great, great. So anytime you want you can just visualize her naked.
Uh, anyway, (Waving bye to everyone) onward and upward.
I don't know why Rachel had to drive back with Michael and Carol.
Yeah, and now someone's going to be taking messages for me.
Yeah, I'm a great quitter. It's one of the few things I do well. I come form a long line of quitters. My father was a quitter, my grandfather was a quitter... I was raised to give up.
How come youre not doin the second show tomorrow?
You had to hop! You had to hop on the plane.
(George takes out the suit from the other rack) Well, look at this. (innocently) This doesn't belong here! Someone has made a terrible mistake.
You know what this means? I can't see her anymore either.
Well, she's smart. You take my word for it.
People smoke, Elaine. My mother smoked. It didnt hurt me.
I tell you this. If the real Phil Rizzuto was down there, this wouldn't be happening!
I hate this mall, there are never any spaces here...
Not a plane crash. (leaving) Is it a plane crash?
Kramer, what are you talking about...Janet doesn't look anything like Jerry
Care? Forget about care. Love. They have to love the characters. Otherwise, why would they keep tuning in?
Everybody's talkin' at me...I can't hear a word they're sayin'...just drivin' around in Jon Voight's car...
There was a woman, Audrey. She had a very big nose.
Oh, she's got the hue. So, what's going on with you and Melanie? I mean, I know you're not getting married, but uh, things are happening?
What, did you go swimmin'? It's 29 degrees out!
All right. At last, we're finally gettin' out of here.
(feeling awkward) Its uh, not bad, its comin along. Why? Did you need something.
Excuse me just for a second. ( fixes his hair looking at his reflection in a coffee pot.)
(Takes a sip) Hey, it's not too bad..
I don't want Morgan's job. He's got a lot of work to do. Hey, Elaine, your friend never woke up Mr. Morgan.
That's what nuns and Red Cross workers are for.
Really? And Debby told me that she fell in love with him because he has all this perspective!
No..hummm, What do you know about what you look like.
What, he can't jump out of the chair? How long does that take? Here look at this. (he moves to the end of the booth) Here, watch. (stands up) Criminals. Boom. I'm up. (pretends he's shooting) Stop It! Stop It! Stop It!
He asked me to keep it a secret.
What about the Coast Guard? Seems like a lot of pride there, a lot of tradition.
No, Ill put half a can of mousse in my head like you.
What? Elaine's big-head guy? They have you the apartment?!
(Long pause) ..Felt like it. I tell you, this doll is pretty spooky. (Takes off his glasses, rubbing his eye) It's freakin' me out man. And now I got to go back out there and pick up this doormat.
So, you didn't think this was a date?
Alright, alright, but no funny business, same deal as last night.
Excuse me, I've got a maniac stalking me, I'm not staying in the city.
Well, why don't *you* go, and I could save the seats. You said you didn't like saving anyway.
Can I say one thing to you? And I say this with an unblemished record of staunch heterosexuality.
Wha! You know, it's a pain to change that. You gotta lift up that plastic thing with a pen.
I can't run, I have a bad hamstring.
I just wanted to talk to Tony for a minute (hands Elaine some stuff)
No, I decided to go with an '89 LeBaron.
Yeah, ha ha, It's not the toilets, it's not the toilets. It's something else. Are you ready for this?
Oh you can stuff your sorries in a sack, Mister!
(shouting) I'm not looking for another line. I got the line.
Why don't we talk about it another time.
Yes, sir, that was a good sandwich, sir.
Why not? It's a good look for a woman.
Why do they have to do that in front of people?
Well, Tony.. took a bit of a tumble
I said faddah, I meant Father. Just a little bit nervous.
Yeah. It's a beautiful name for a boy or a girl...
I mean I'm the one who bought it.
(to a street vender selling hot dogs) You must hate hot dogs, huh? Or else, you, uh, you really like 'em and that's why you, you do this.
You know, Einstein wore the exact same outfit every day.
This could be in a museum some day! It's not safe with me! It should really be in a doormanned building.
me too, I am down, I am totally down, mark me down
As you will see, the candy bar is paid for, and yet, remains dangling in the machine. (Notices that the Twix slot is completely empty) Hey, its gone. Where is my Twix? (Quickly looks around. His sights fall on the window of a door labeled "Employees Only". The same mechanic from before is eating a candy bar) What?! That guys eatin it!
kissed me. We both had tears streaming down our faces. I never saw anyone so beautiful. It was at that moment that I decided to tell her that, I was not a marine biologist.
Jerry! I did it! Haha! I beat Braun!
Miss Rhode Island? When are you seeing her?
Well at least you and I are talking about how there's nothing to talk about.
Huh. Excuse me (to Ping) Hum... Do you speak chinese?
I thought tomorrow maybe we'd try a little corn beef.
Ok, we got your...got your strawberries, your chocolate sauce, your pastrami on rye with mustard, your honey...
(to Jerry) Huh-ho! Have you ever seen anything like this?
(Arms out) I am king of the county. You?
Well, he is. I, uh, I live around the corner.
(Trying to keep his voice down) I think you've done a lot more than talk! You betrayed me!
(looking over her resume) Well Miss Coggins you're ah, obviously qualified for the job. You've all the necessary skills and experience. But you're extremely attractive. you're gorgeous. Im looking at you, I can't even remember my name. So ah, Im afraid this is not going to work out (he crumples her resume into a ball) Thanks for coming in.
And then, then, then she leaves with somebody else! Never even, never even said goodbye! Never called me back.. Never apologized. Nothing. Like I was dirt.
I'm baby-sitting! Vivian asked me to raise him if she doesn't make it.
(shouts) Of course there's something wrong! (points at Jerry) We had a pact!
...yeah, my wife started getting on me about the lawn today. Im tellin you, its one thing after another.
Huh, strawberries, anyone? (eats a strawberry) Ah, that's good. Ooh, juicy this time of year.
They're worse! They're much worse than us, they talk about everything! Couldn't you at least tell her about the shrinkage factor?
I watched "Beaches" on cable last night. (wings?)  Give me a break.
I don't know. I closed my eyes and made a move.
(Munching on a hamburger) This Arbys is good.
bowling! what do you say bowling? bowling's insane! bowling is crazy time
This is by far the most exciting thing I've ever done.
I don't think we should see each other any more.
The nice one that works in my office.
All right there you go. It's a '47 cabin all right. So, we'll see you tomorrow.
Yes. Yes. Care. You know who I think about a lot? Remember SUSAN ? The one that used to work for NBC?
(Puts nuts into his mouth, and in the process covers his mouth) We bring her to the party, and she can tell me what Gwen is saying about me.
Sometimes in life, the gods smile upon you, my friends.
I have to rewind it first. (George presses the rewind button on the tape recorder. He and Jerry stand there, waiting impatiently as it rewinds.) Alright, alright.
(agitated) Well, I, I couldn't come. I, I had to drive my mother to, to the chiropodist.
Well, last night she told me that she liked you. Not you, the disturbed you, so I had to tell her the truth.
(crestfallen) But you said it was my call.
OH!!!! What are you, crazy?! Are you, crazy?!
I don't know, I have to call her, tell her where we are. I'm very lucky she's even considering seeing me at all.
(checking the fridge) No Chinese leftovers. George is gettin' suspicious.
Maybe you don't have to be so funny. I mean, would it kill you not to be so funny all the time? That's all I'm asking. This woman thinks I'm very funny. Now you're gonna be funny, so what am I gonna be? I'm gonna be a short bald guy with glasses who suddenly doesn't seem so funny.
Watch the arm! Tim, listen, we don't want to bother you, we know you're busy here.
You can go crazy trying to figure that place out.
..And I went down there one time to see...
Well, I'm just expressing my gratitude to our gracious host.
It was an inferno in there! An inferno! (Eric, Robin's mother, and all the kids rush at George.)
(to Mickey) Can't you just switch with another Midget?
'The lights are much brighter there. You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares, just go...'
Yeah. So what's going on? We're gonna shoot the pilot and then it's gonna be on TV the following week?
Elaine, get off the speaker! (Elaine picks up phone)
Ah, Alright, before that, I was in real estate. I quit, because the boss wouldn't let me use his private bathroom. That was it.
Its unbelievable. You know what else is unbelievable? I picked up the check. She didnt even offer. She ended it. The least she could do is send me off with a sandwich.
(desperate) Steinbrenner had me committed! I'm in the nuthouse!
Ya gotta put on a show, ya always gotta give them a big show. You always have to be 'on' otherwise why would they like me? They'd just go for a better looking guy with more money.
So what happened? She throw you out? Eh?
You're telling me. (he walks around and the suit makes a swooshing sound) So, what do you think?
(Quick, excited talking) Hey, hey! You can't believe this. Look at this check! (Hands it to Jerry) They told me I had the most beautiful hands they'd ever seen in their lives - except for this McKigney guy - this great looking girl gave me her phone number.. I got it! I got it all! I'm busting. Jerry, I'm busting!
You know, uh, she has no female friends! You know that, don't cha? Something strange about a woman whos friends are all men.
I can't go in there. Im too uncomfortable.
All right, I'm gonna find a guy with a truck. GLC must live on!
'Scarsdale surprise'. That's the musical about that Scarsdale diet doctor murder.
Okay. Now, why do I have to see (points) you?
you better be careful on those rocks tomorrow buddy. And you're not getting any sandwiches either
Yes, good to see you, too. And Good luck with, uh... with the whole thing, there.
Not a bad way to make a buck.
Here. (panicky) We'll leave it here for you!
Yeah, I may move out there. (getting 'yeah, right' glances from the Rosses) I mean it, I'll do it! OK, I'll see ya later. Keep it real!
Alright, alright! (Goes out onto the sidewalk. The Seinfelds walk by) Seinfelds!
Hey, at least I was a camp waiter.
Hehehehehe (higher tone laugh, though still quietly )
Well, I wanna talk to him about this.
Hey, listen don't oversleep. You can't afford to be late again.
Of course you will. (quick chuckle). You're the best. (with a light fist motion across her chin)
(penny drops) Oh, uh, wait a minute, wait a minute. (snorts) Is this about money?
No, it hit the table, it hit the table.
Kramer, what's the name of the store with the mannequin?
So, um, you've read "The Big Game", have you?
I knew I had hit my high note so I thanked the crowd and I was gone.
Yeah, that's exactly what I'm worried about. God would never let me be successful. He'd kill me first. He'd never let me be happy.
Like a "Hey your mother is uglier than Hazel. Hazel really puts your mother to shame"
Yea, ya..ya know I feel terrible about Joey but it's jus..it's a great business opportunity. I-I don't even know how long I'm gonna be away for.
All right, let's--let's focus. Can we get back to the plan?
Oh, nothing much. You know, I went over to Jerry's. Talked to Jerry. Um, could I talk to you for a minute?
Cops. I don't even care about cops. I wanna see more garbage men. It's much more important. All I wanna see are garbage trucks, garbage cans and garbage men. You're never gonna stop crime, we should at least be clean.
Reilly is no longer with the club. (getting up) You believe that?
Hey by the way my parents really want to have your parents over dinner before they leave town.
(on tape, singing) "Believe it or not, George, isn't at home, please leave a mes-saaage at the beep. I must be out or I'd pick up the pho-one. Where could I be? Believe it or not, I'm not hooome." (beep)
I don't know. He can be so weird sometimes.
Let's go, people, let's go! It's Prognosis Negative time, wa ha ha ha!!!
This is a real piece of junk. I don't even feel safe on this thing. I have a good mind to write a letter toMr. Kimbrough.
Youre a fine person. Youre a humanitarian. Shes very sexy.
He said he didn't care. Oh, God I love that place. Hey, have you seen other dermatologist?
I don't know. He said he wants to be my "key brother."
Yeah, I mentioned Simons. Next thing I know, Im in the parking lot. Perhaps they had some sort of a falling out. Ill tell you one thing. I dont know what hes got. But for a sick guy, hes very strong.
There's elevators all over! It all looks the same.
Yeah. Hey Jerry, listen to this. I discovered something even better than conjugal visit sex. Fugitive sex! Now, it's like everytime -
All right. So let me ask you a question. Who was the man in the cape?
Of course I'm back. Why wouldn't I be back? My mother's in the hospital, I'm going to pay her a visit.
No, I fake limp on my right. This is a real limp because I sprained my ankle.
Oh, I was uh, I was waiting downstairs for the jackhammer, thought I'd drop by.
What was wrong with that? I had a different interpretation! Do you know anything about this pretzel guy?! Maybe he's been in the bar a really long time and he's really depressed because he has no job and no woman and he's parking cars for a living! (out the window to honking cars) Alright! Alright! Shut up! Shut up! I hear you! I'm coming down! These pretzels are making me thirsty!
No. No it's not. You don't know this guy. It woulda been so sweet.
(quietly) That's uh, for the two of us.
(To Susan) I told you it looked like her..
Sure, dudes in this town are dime a dozen.
Busy. Don't give me busy. Who's not busy? I'm busy, we're all busy, everybody's busy. All right, tell me, what's kept you so busy?
(to Jerry) Have you seen the waitresses in there lately? I never had so much coffee in my life.
We gotta get something. I don't want to go to that meeting on an empty stomach. Let's get some Chinese. You wanna order it?
you know, just by conversing, you can really learn a lot about a person.
Uh, yeah, I'll be there in a minute.
Sounds like a scam. (takes a bite from the granola bar)
This woman left this really sexy message on Jerry's tape recorder......
You could pet them. They come right out of the water onto the sidewalks.
Were aware of the proximity to the park, yes.
That's not funny. So, are you coming to the party?
Yeah, the kind that Castro smoked. You can't buy ?em anywhere.
It won't for a while. At least not until after the cast comes off.
I can't have any parties while they're out of town. (he leaves to return the soaps)
Hey, speaking of which, I found a great way to separate the skin from the top of the pudding without leaving any around the edges; Exacto knife.
Oh, I think so, and I can prove it. You see, I was doodling on the bill and uh, so if you have a twenty in there with big lips on it... well, (smiles) that's mine. Would you mind opening up the register?
All right, relax, tough guy. I got to go out to my father's garage, help him sell some computers.
How about the old Spider Man live action show?
Well then, from out of nowhere, a huge tidal wave lifted me, tossed like a cork and I found myself right on top of him, (ELAINE gasps quietly Ahhhh) face to face with the blow-hole. I-I, I could barely see from the waves crashing down upon me but, I knew something was there so I reached my hand in, felt around and pulled out the obstruction!
She's got everything, right? (counts on his fingers) She's intelligent, she's smart, she's got a great sense of humour.
No, no, no. Out of the question. I was over there today. He's got the good spot in front of the good building in the good neighbourhood. I know he's not gonna wanna move.
I could have had some ice cream. I think that might have calmed down the nachos.
You gotta give us odds. At least two to one - you gotta put up two-hundred dollars.
I never should have brought her up there. Should have known better. Should have seen it coming. I didn't see it coming.
I think you absolutely have to say something to this guy. Confront him.
Hi, we're from the United Volunteers, we've come to pick up the TV.
Oh, nothin' much. I went over to jerry's, uh, talked to Jerry.
Excuse me, uh I couldn't help but notice that you were looking in my direction.
I am. The folks are twelve hundred miles away. (gleeful) I'm basking in the buffer zone. (looks for the waitress) 'Nother piece of pie here!
Excuse me...huh... I think I made a big mistake. I'd like my deposit back please.
Well, I'm not buying it. No way. Forget it. No way I'm buying this! (beat) I mean, look at it! What is it? It's a bunch of squiggly lines! (beat) Are you telling me you couldn't paint this?
You know I'm enjoying it very much. I think my coworkers are really taking to me.
No, listen; we are always sitting here, I am always helping you with your girl problems and you are helping me with my girl problems. Where do we end up?
Who am I going to tell? My mother? Like I've got nothing better to talk about.
Ha, ha ha uh, I'm not following that.
Never mind what happened, just give me the key.
He purposely mispronounced my name. Instead of saying, "Costanza" He'd say, "Can't stand ja". "Can't stand ja" ... He made me smell my own gym socks once.
(con't) All right, you know she's got that laugh. What did you say? It's like Elmer Fudd sitting on a juicer?
The parakeet in the mirror. That's a good one, Stu.
And everything else has changed. But toilet paper is exactly the same, and will be so until we're dead.
You must be very proud Mr. Visaki. (shaking his hand) And may I say sir they're lovely girls, absolutely lovely girls. It's nice to see such fine upstanding women in gainful employment, Mr. Visaki.
Hey, what happened with Sandy. I forgot all about it. Did you call her?
She wants me to take an IQ test.
You disappoint me, my friend. Sandy wants nothing to do with you. She tells Laura, "If you want to waste your time with that pervert, that's your problem."
Who am I going to meet who is better than her? No one, Jerry. No one's better than her.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's it. More of that, difficult. I'm a difficult seed.
(TALKING IN PASSENGER WINDOW) I didn't mean anything by it. I don't even know L. Ron Hubbard! I didn't know you were...
You never should have taken away his keys!
What, are you kidding? (Points at the flaws of Jerry's hands) The knuckles are all out of proportion. you got hair over there - where do you get off comparing your hands to my hands?! This is a one-in-a-million hand. (Points to his own hand)
Yes! Yes, I'm the one! Hey! So, you know Jon Voight!
You know it must be impossible for a Spanish person to order seltzer and not get salsa. (Angry) "I wanted seltzer, not salsa."
Well, you know, I gotta go to, uh, Susan's parent's house for dinner.. and, you know, I want to shower first.. and I want to leave myself plenty of time.
I-I'm already here. I'm here. I'm here. Uh, you know what? If you want a computer, call me. I-I gotta go.
"Breakfast At Tiffany's." 90 pages. (Waves a hand like it's nothing.)
(still on the phone) All right fine.... Whatever
Alright. Listen, I gotta get some reading done. You mind if I do this here? I can't concentrate in my apartment.
What I don't get is, just because the battery is dead, you think she'd be able to roll up the hill with her hands!
I saw Amy making out with your cousin Jeffrey.
Yeah, yeah. You gotta come over tonight. We can play.
You know, Lloyd, I-I've been to the doctor (hands George the card) there's really nothing they can do.
I need higher. This has paba in it, I need paba-free.
Did you see that? That-that pigeon didn't move! I had to swerve to get out of the way! I saved that pigeons life!
No difference. I could care less. She's Jerry's girlfriend.
Wish I could. (raises the magazine up in front of his face and continues reading.)
I dont want to get out of it.
Maybe somebody did it and didn't take credit for it. Maybe it was already done and didn't need doing in the first place. I have no idea who did it, what they did, or how they did it so well. And you know what? Jimmy crack corn and I don't care.
Maybe I could move them until you get back.
Hello! All right, we should be going. Come on...
Alright the administrator's on the third floor. I'll meet you guys back at the car.
If this lip reading thing works tonight do you know how incredible this is going to be? It's like having Superman for your friend.
'When you're alone, and life is making you lonely, you can always go...'
No, that's right, I didn't. I take full responsibility for the card not being here. I, uh, . . .
Heh, haa. And that's no good. I've tried it straight, Jerry. We've all seen the results. For me, sick is the only way to go.
(removing his glasses) You know, Hawaii could be a little tricky right now, there's a lot of high pressure winds down there this time of year, there's a lot of debris constantly flying around. Wood, and uh, lava, pretty dangerous.
I guess you two are the lucky ones.
I'm just sayin' I wanna have some fun.
If you go now, I know what's gonna happen. We'll find the car, Jerry will show up, and then we'll never find you.
(still by the door) What? M-Maura, what are you doin' here? I ended this relationship... twice!
Maybe he was going to say "Of course I have to check with my associates."
Oh I think I'd go for the back.
So, you send me to this therapist to help me with my emotional disorders, and she criticizes our script. (Tosses the script to Jerry.) What kind of a therapist is that?
Well nothing. I didn't actually say that. (Karen is still laughing)
How come you don't know what street are you on?
Because if I watch it at my apartment I feel like I'm not doing anything. If I watch it here, I'm out of the house; I'm doing something.
Let's say it comes down to me and one other guy. He's got a nice quiet suit, and I'm whooshing all over the place! Who do you think he's gonna hire?
Rid? Nah, c'mon, the word is 'care'. Care. I care about your comfort, be it here in Queens or twelve-hundred miles away.
Well, I don't see how I'm gonna make December. I mean, I need a little more time. I mean, look at me I'm a nervous wreck. My stomach aches. My neck is killing me. I can't turn. Look. Look.
I hurt it in a hotel room. You know where they tuck the covers in real tight in those hotel rooms? I can't sleep like that so I tried to kick it out and I pulled it.
Reprogram all the buttons, see if he changes them back. You know? The old switcheroo.
No, you're not taking a deli slicer to my boss...
I had a feeling you would like it. No, don't try it on now, try it on later.
You don't? Boy, I think about it a lot. I think about it at my age. Imagine how much I'll be thinkin' about it at your age. All I'll do is keep thinkin' about it until it drives me insane...
I still don't understand this. Abby has a mentor?
We talked about his new batting stance, you know, I'm not crazy about it, but I said , 'Donny, go with it 'till it stops workin'.' Donny baseball. He's a helluva guy.
It was on CNN ( Kramer comes in and he is taping from a Camcorder) This Chinese doctor Zeng Zau. has discovered a cure for baldness.
Uh why don't you wait then go in the movies?
'scuse me. I uh, I was in here this morning and uh, I believe I paid you with a twenty dollar bill, (smiles) but you only gave me change for a ten.
All right, forget that idea, it's not for you....Okay, okay, I got it. You run an antique store.
(In a state of hysteria) I'm an eggplant! I'm an eggplant! I'm a minstrel man!
She supports her whole family. (walking slowly into the room)
Jerry, a throat-clear is a non-verbal implication of doubt - he thinks I killed Susan!
Fine. (hits his arm on the desk) Ow!
(standing) All right, I'm gonna move my car, my meter's up. Can't park in this city.
Parker, I never said driver, I said parker, a great parker.
(panicky) What are you gonna do? Are you gonna call the police?
I hate asking for change. They always make a face. Like I'm asking them to donate a kidney.
You just gave them to him two days ago, he's gotta give you a grace period.
Well it's not fair, Jerry. It's just not fair. All right, all right. That's it. I'm getting out of this thing.
Yeah, the oceans really are getting very sudsy.
Jody let's do this agian real soon (he tends his arms for a hug but she avoids him)
Well, I'm sure they'll be able to fix it. You can't stop modern science. Can't stop it, you can't stop it. Can't stop science. Can't be stopped, no way, no how, science just marches--
Oh, sports are so pedestrian. I've prepared some science experiments that will illuminate the mind and dazzle the eye.
Listen, you go over to the ticket counter, I'm going to go stop in the gift shop and pick up a copy of Time magazine. There's supposed to ba blurb about Jerry in it and I think he mentioned my name!
Aren't those the guys that always go crazy and come back with a gun and shoot everybody?
I know. The only way to fix it now, is to get a whole new photo of Kruger.
Oh, that's the worst part of it. He looks just like me.
Well, you could move in with my parents. (chuckles)
...It was all a terrible misunderstanding, sir. Just five minutes. Just five minutes of your time. (listens) Thank you! Thank you, Mister Dalrimple.
(angry, to himself) The ocean called. Running outta shrimp. Outta shrimp! (a thought occurs) Oh! Yes! That's what I shoulda said! (frustrated shout) Dammit!
Well what would be the point of that?
I hope so. I can't take him living with me much longer. He makes this kasha, it stinks up the whole house.
Well, don't they make a counter offer? How can they just cancel the whole deal like that? What kind of a maniac is this guy? I mean he just, he says no, and that's it?
Ah. You know, there's gotta be an easier way to open ketchups. They should make it in a tube.
Yeah. I got 'em down to fifty bucks. I just have to do all the jackhammering myself.
We just go up to him, we say, "We're O'Brien."
No, no. I reached down and there was *nothing* there.
It's fine, we'll just meet him at the bubble boy's house.
How can I do this? How can I move back in with those people? Please, tell me. They're insane. You know that.
Hey, what about this? I'm in a car accident. The motorist is uninsured, you with me?
You're right. Why must there always be a problem? You'd think just once I could get a break. God knows I earned it with that score!
Are you crazy? This is like discovering Plutonium ... by accident.
Jerry! Jerry! Je Jerry Jerry . The most unbelievable thing has just happened, it's too Unbelievable! I'm sitting in the coffee shop, i'm talking to Susan, were talking about shoe laces (does two guns to the head) so in walks..in walks David, right, he walks right to the table..righ I introduced him to Susan..and he says get this (laughs) he says 'boy you could do a lot better than this guy' huh right (more laughing by George, Jerry is totally just mellow and straight faced) The exact same thing that I said to him, just to get back at me just to get back at me..and then, and then she says she wants to be alone for awhile..Alone Jerry! I think that she thinks that she could do better (laughs) Do you appreciate this? Do you see the irony of this? Do you see what is going on here? What's the matter?
What do you mean Wednesday? I though we had tickets to the Knick game Wednesday. We got seats behind the bench! What happened? Were not going?
(incredulity) Him you brainwashed! (angry shout) What's he got that I don't have?!
Look, why couldn't you make me an architect? You know I always wanted to pretend that I was an architect. Well I-I'm supposed to see her tomorrow, I-I-I'm gonna tell her what's goin on. I mean maybe she just likes me for me.
Would I want to see what Mary Todd wore to Lincoln's funeral?
Yeah, I want to see if there's anything I can do.. maybe get him another job.. maybe I'll hear of something.
Oh No nonono I'm not a cop ...Heum... I work for the Yankees.
Oh my god he's not kidding. (exhale gasp)
(getting animated) Yeah. Yeah. You know the odds of me being anyone's type?! I have never been anyone's type, but apparently, this Marisa Tomei loves funny, quirky, bald men.
Listen, you're lucking I'm not asking for a whole refund. (trying to speak quietly) You gave me ladies' frames!
Handicap? (gesturing to his cane) Oh, I'm not handicapped.
No no no, he's not getting away with this.
Yeah, woman have no problem getting the hand off. How do they do that?
Oh yes I am Father. Incredibly sincere. So, uh, pffft, am I in?
Oh, I understand. (George exits; Sees Kramer in the hallway) Hey.
O.k....(is about to explain. Cut to Jerry on-stage.)
Going to need a little more coffee here.
Yeah, see, uh, when we met, I was over there and, uh, you were over here, so the image, uh, the image was reversed, like, uh, like in the mirror.
Well, I'm also an architect. Is that pastrami?
Five-thousand? Why would anybody buy Kramer for $5000? (laughs)
Hey, yeah. My parents want to come too, is that ok?
Oh. Okay, here it is, I got it. She lost her thumbs in a tractor accident and they grafted her big toes on. They do it every day.
No, I can't. What if I meet a woman? I'd always be worried about that first moment where I'd take it off and see that look of disappointment on her face.
So we started drinking, and I'll tell you I don't know if it was the alcohol or the ammonia, but the next think I knew she was mopping the floor with me.
So what! Have a yoke! It won't kill you.
No. Nothing. Fine. (he sits at the table)
(excited) Did I tell you that story's relatable?! That was a great show! That is why I'm bringing it back to NBC.
(on a pay phone) Hey, hey, it's George, I need ya to do me a favor.
(he thinks a little about it... and as he puts his hand on his knee and gets up) I'm sorry Karen. I know I care for you, but I just can't stand when someone doesn't like me. (he opens the door)
Ow! .. Ow! I give, I give! Uncle!
No good? All right, uh how about Art... Cor.....
Do me a favor would you? Would you change lanes? Would you get outta this lane. You gotta get out of this lane. This lane stinks. They're all double parked here Please get outta this lane. I'm beggin you please please.
Yeah, yeah. She's seeing this guy, Art Vandelay.
YES! It Blows Up! If you knew that, what did you tell Elaine for?
Would you stop that please. Would you just stop that?
Well, if I could talk to the mothers and have sex with the daughters, then I'd really have something goin'.
Well what would I say in the note?
It's worth a shot. (Goes to the door.)
I'll tell you what happened. I bet he got the AM/PM mixed-up.
Stop it, stop it! It's not fair. It's not fair. I don't like this situation, Jerry. I don't like it one bit.
This is very hard to follow with all the talking.
Could I, uh, could I trade you for another dollar?
I love this place. You know, Carl and I come here all the time.
Maybe Manya missed the funeral because she was off visiting another galaxy that day.
Ah-Ha! (he turns and walks over to the refrigerator)
(Holding his drink up to his mouth) Oh my gosh, I just had a great idea. She could come to the party tomorrow and read Gwen's lips for me.
All right, all right, calm down, calm down. Whatever happened in the past is past.
Why can't we do this on the phone? What's Kramer doing now?
Please. They dont do anything. Look, do I have to break up with her in person? Cant I do it over the phone? I-I have no stomach for these things.
(Frantically) Did anybody call here asking for Vandelay industries?
Hey, look at this. This is the same massage chair we're gettin' for Joe Mayo, $60 cheaper.
Okay, so you remember I made the initial call Sunday, she doesnt call back. I call again Monday, I leave another message. I call Tuesday, I get the machine again, I know youre there, I dont know what your story is. Yesterday, Im a volcano  I try one more call, the machine comes on, and I let fly like Mussolini from the balcony, Where the hell do you get the nerve? You invite me up for coffee and then you dont call me back for four days? I dont like coffee, I dont have to come up. Id like to get one more shot at the coffee just so I could spit it in your face.
Hey! Did 'ya ever do that thing on the toes that I said .
All I know about is sports. That's it. No matter how depressed I get, I could always read the sports section.
(talking to nobody) I like horses. Maybe I could be a stable boy.
(leaving to the bedroom) I gave it to Cosmo.
Almost. Couldn't get the girl go out with me the second time.
Whoop! Too late. I think he picked up the scent.
I got to get downtown and buy that suit. The store opens in twenty minutes.
I solve problems. That's just what I do.
(inhales deeply) I tell you, Jerry, I'm feeling something. Something I haven't felt in a long time.
All right, he's letting you in. Thank you! Creep.
Jerry, just remember. It's not a lie... if you believe it.
Remember when you came to audition for us?
What kind of a sick person would do a thing like that?
I'm bored. She's boring, I'm boring, we're both boring. We got out to eat, we both read newspapers.
No, its not a problem, I can get rid of the apartment this afternoon.
How do you know? What if pig-man had a two-seater?
A backup system? We're designing bathroom doors with our legs exposed in anticipation of the locks not working? That's not a system. That's a complete breakdown of the system.
I don't know. I do know that I have some kind of a talent - something to offer. I just don't know what it is yet!
Oh, the hell with it. Let him kill me. I..
(shifty, avoiding Jerry's eyes) Fine, fine. (he removes his coat)
Two-man? It's all me. Kruger doesn't do anything; Disappears for hours at a time, gives me fake excuses. This afternoon I found him with sleep creases on his face. The only reason I got out to get a bite today was that he finally promised to buckle down and do some actual work. (turning around, George sees Mr. Kruger at a booth eating a piece of cake) Oh, I don't believe this. This is what I have to put up with, Jerry. (He walks over) Mr. Kruger? Who said he was going to do some actual work today? Who?
All right. That's enough for today. You're tired. Get some sleep. I'll see you first thing in the morning.
Right. The other members of our party. (closes partition) Other members of our party? What other members of our party? I didn't even know we were in a party. Oh, I'm telling you, the jig is up.
So what, they don?t have another plane? She couldn't take a bus?
No, I did not! (They exit the coffee shop.)
(knocking on the counter and feigning a muffled, Chinese voice) Chinese food!
(Panicky) Uh, yeah. You know, Doctor, I gotta tell you, I feel a lot better.
Well, Marisa. See, the thing is... I'm sort of engaged.
Das kaffes un salat e grand por favor.
Play Now thinks I got problems in both legs. My own personal Rascal, Jerry. On the house.
Wha? Did you use those? These are guest soaps! (he grabs the soaps and begins examining them for damage)
Ade, you're a wonder. (he he -- george laughs)
You see. You see! Listen when is your next drawing class?
Ya, ya. I bumped into him on the bus. What did he have to say?
I bet they have more money than mine.
Oh, I, uh, I disagree. You've, uh, you've been living in America too long. (indicates the bag of oranges) You've forgotten what it's like to have no oranges.
Alright, alright! We'll buy her a wheelchair! Wheelchairs, engagement presents.. IT NEVER ENDS!
Excuse me, the guy is wearing a jacket that my friend is...
I was quoting him. Why would I be insulted? I'm never insulted. You could call me baldy, dump soup on my head. Nothing insults me.
Wait, wait. Here me out. Don't dismiss this. You're very quick to dismiss. Don't dismiss. She's got a big crush on David Letterman, I mean, a big crush. She talks about him all the time. Suppose I go up to David Letterman. He works at NBC; I work at NBC. I explain my situation. He agrees to meet her. They go out, they fall madly in love. And she dumps me for David Letterman.
Mister Fowler, I-I have a squirrel here that is a miracle of modern science! (laughs)
Wow,  god! You see this is all I think about. Sleeping with a giant. It's my life's ambition.
What is that? Its ridiculous! You dont even know what hotel shes staying at, you cant call her. Thats a signal, Jerry, thats a signal! (snaps his fingers) Signal!
Huh-ho! Oh! You are too much, Mr. Kruger! Too much!
The guy that stole my glasses. This time I got 'em! (George follows the man onto the street, dragging the blind man with him) Would you pick it up a little?
That's where the Seinfeld's are moving. They got a great deal. Yep. You know what they got in Florida? Jai-Alai! You bet on the games, you clean up.
I love it. New office, new salary. I'm the new Wilhelm.
Yeah, I do that too. I feel guilty about getting the pleasure. I feel like I don't deserve it so I talk. It stops me from enjoying it. There's nothing to eat in here.
What about me? I was a total failure. Everything was fine. Now this thing's gonna be a success and God's gonna give me a terminal disease.
I had to say something. (chuckles) I had to say something. Everything was going so well. I had to say something.
It's just that I was the one who actually paid for the big salad. She just happened to hand it to you. But it's no big deal.
When do you ever have ten car lengths?
No no no, this ones different. This ones a beauty!
I have no power Do you understand? I need hand. I have no hand.
All right, so what's the penalty here? Let's just pay the fine or something and get the hell out of here.
This is not about them. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to exercise Jerry's gaskets.
Why don't you just look at your watch?
The truth. you want the truth? It is your earrings It is the chopsticks but it's so much more. You're pretentious. You call everyone by their full name You call my doorman, Sammy, "Samuel" but you didn't even say "Samuel" You went "Sam - U- EL" Papie-eh Mach-eh What is Papie-ay Mach-ay?
I dunno. I guess I have to wait for her to die.
I just thought it would be nice. A little variety.
I'll tell you what. Why don't we just get a couple of dishes and we'll just share 'em.
Oh now you're gonna go? ELAINE I'll be back in five minutes.
Oh, what time is it? Eight thirty? I'll tell you what's on. You got Major Dad, Blossom, very funny programme...
So it was my comment that broke them up?
(to Jerry) "You know those shoes that Jimmy had? I cut a deal with him. We're gonna import a case of them together."
Fragile Frankie Merman? I never liked that guy.
No one gives us the finger! We're Yankees!
Yeah. Not only that, this is what she said to me, "Can we change the subject?"
(pointing outside) Why is there a Cadillac parked in front of the house?
Ha Ho! (he turns and walks out the door)
Yeah, anyway, she's uh, having some kind of a family lunch, I'll swing by after.
Oh, I just, uh, leased a house out in the Hamptons, and I have got to get out there this weekend and sign the papers.
Well, I wanna put a picture of me and my boss Mr. Morgan up at the office.
I-I just don't react well to these situations. My grandmother died two months early because of the way I reacted in the hospital. She was getting' better. And then I went to pay her a visit. She saw my face. BOOM. That was the end of it.
I thought you said he was gonna get a muffin.
I am not buying something just to get change.
(puts down handset) Because he'll know I told you. Besides, he's giving me a parking spot around the corner for practically nothing.
I'm gonna read a book. From beginning to end. In that order.
(smiling) Listen, I..I..I don't mean to seem forward...
Now Im in the worst position of all.
Oh, this is fabulous. My God Elaine, you have to taste this.
You know the anxiety you feel on a date? That's what I have every day now. My worst nightmare's come true, every day is a date.
I'm not paying $500 for this! It's a piece of junk!
I got rejected by a bald woman. A bald woman rejected me. Heh, you like that one? A woman with no prospects and no *hair*, told me that I wasn't her type. Apparently *baldy* likes a slimmer guy.
You're not going to get back here in time!
Oh, no. No no no no no. Id have to advise against that. What, do you know this woman a month? Lets see, youre going to be with her seventy-two hours. Thats a dating decathlon.
Anna actually has respect for me now. (laughs/snorts) It's all over.
(pointedly) Oh, I'm sorry, I require twenty-four hours notice for a cancellation. Now, as I see it, you owe me seventy-five dollars.
I said, would you like to go for a walk or something.
Oh my God! (coming out of bathroom) You know what I just realized?! If they get divorced an' live in two separate places? That's twice as many visits!
It'll have to be a night job anyway. You don't normally work after dinner, do you?
I don't think so I know so, Kramer, come here I got to talk to you
I was in there for two minutes. He didnt do anything. Touch this, feel that  seventy-five bucks!
When I find that guy, this much I vow those glasses will be returned to their rightful owner.
(smiling) Well, we're certainly glad that you could make it.
No, don't say a word. If she thinks my friends are jerks, then I'm a *jerk*...
You're in the movie? Is he in the scene?
She told me she wants-- (Pauses until a woman coming down the stairs passes) She told me she wants me to make love to her.
Im starving! I can feel my stomach sucking up against my spine.
...and, and maybe shell see me when she gets there, does this woman intend to spend time with me?
No problem. There's no problem. She just owes me ten dollars, that's all.
I'm starving. We should have had lunch first..
(forced buoyancy) Hey, you know, let's call Susan, we'll go have coffee.
Oh with all due respect, I went there too, and I work for a team that just won the World Series.
S-s-somebody double parked, we couldn't help it. It might have been Saddam Hussein, we're not really sure. He eh, had a British accent though.
"Aahhrgh...it wouldn't take...... long pause, audience laughter) ten minutes from now, I'll be sweating all over again ,I can feel it. I'm a human heat pump!"
Out. (Jerry shakes his head in agreement) Wow. I spend so much time trying to get their clothes off, I never thought of taking mine off. (Jerry nods; George looks at his watch) Alright, Hey come on, get out of here, Dophne gonna be here any minute.
Right.. the sign. (Hesitates, then makes a series of stupid gestures)
Yes I look forward to many years of... looking at the triangles. Well, I'll ah, I'll wait for you outside.
So, uh, Mom, Dad, I was hoping that you could help me to remember my childhood a little clearly..
Does that mean I have to go too?
(enthusiastic) Yeah. You get a couch. I get rid of my father. It couldn't be more perfect!
I can't carry a pen. I'm afraid I'll puncture my scrotum.
You don't need the cufflinks! You have the same name! (no reaction) 'Jerry'! (heads for door, grabbing his coat)
We get to go to the opera together!
Yes, I know so. You happen to be a very eligible lesbian.
No, no, Hey I'll get it. What's in the BIG salad?
Hey. Hey. Answer me! Come on, show yourselves!
Well, I - I could, Uh, I could give the money back. Here. (Holds it out)
It's just paper on a roll, that's it. And that's all it will ever be.
Shouldn't we at least drop off your bag?
(shouting) How d'you not like Soda?! It's bubbly, it's refreshing!
(Persistent) Perhaps you could look again, please? Im very hungry.
Whaddya mean, you'll ``get'' the popcorn and the soda?
Right. I don't have it on me. Allison, this is Susan. Susan, Allison.
Boy, she is nice. I like her, I like her Jerry. She's got substance. She oozes substance.
I got two tickets to see "Guys And Dolls".
Yeah. Never seen anyone so bored. I'm working like a dog here. Give me a moan. *Something*. I'd settle for a belch, for god's sake. All right, come on, let's have it.
if you hadn't come, this whole thing wouldn't have happen (back on Jerry and Elaine's side, we can hear George saying "I was the one who was invited", Jerry opens the door)
Ah, well, you know we gotta been running because of the ...
(pauses for a few seconds) OK, I'm tellin' you right now - if your kiddin' around I'm not gonna be able to be your friend anymore. I'm serious about that. You got that.
Listen. Let me ask you something. If you and Mona were ever to... dance, how do you decide who leads? I mean... do you take turns? Do you discuss it beforehand? How does that work?
Look at that guy. Right there. Isn't that the guy from the show? He's..he's wearing the jacket.
(Putting his jacket on) I'd like to apologize. I want to tell him I.. I.. didn't mean to get him in trouble.
Yes, full. I love to be full ... love to sit back, loosen the old belt and digest away for hours. Let those enzymes do their work.
(Somewhat stern) Oh, the thing's cancelled. Sit down.
You're not goin to do it? What do you mean, You're not goin to do it?
Since when is Elaine's boyfriend selling cars? I thought he was a mechanic.
We've just been through this! You don't remember? We just had this exact same conversation a minute ago!
I really don't think we're supposed to be talkin' about this.
...and then when I saw the photo I remembered where I'd seen him; the boom box incident.
Yeah, I told her to call me here and to tell anyone who answers the phone to ask for a balding, stocky man with glasses. I better tell him I'm expecting a call.
Well just take an overview. Can't you just take an overview?
Hum..( to Elaine) Hey! did you talk to Paula?
Yeah, I think I got a touch of something, too.
I have mourned for three long months! Summer months, too! Anybody could grieve in January! It's time for George to start being George again.
You are not gonna believe whats going on with this woman.
Oh geeeee. (George pantomimes sticking a knife in his heart, and twists it.) Go, go!
Well don't let him take advantage of you like that.
I got him Yankee's tickets! He got me a piece of paper saying "I've given your gift to someone else!"
But, but I'm disturbed! I'm depressed! I'm inadequate! I got it all!!
Is there a meal allowance? What about seat assignments? Could I have the Kosher meal? I hear the Kosher meal is good. And I need clothes. Gotta get a haircut. Gonna have to, I have to refill my allergy medication. Oh, do I need a hat? I need a hat, don't I? Could we do the Universal tour? They have that Backdraft exhibit now, that looks very cool to me...
Yeah, well when you don't actually do the steps, you can go through them pretty quick. You can get through six a day.
These are the balloons? Big deal, all I see is Woody Woodpecker.
Ah hah. You see Father, Im Im incredibly anxious to become a member. Um, dont you offer any kind of an express conversion? A quick change?
Maybe it's not even stupidity. Maybe it's just a blatant disregard for basic human decency. Yeah this how dictator's start. Do you think Mussolini would circle the block six times looking for a spot?
Lets not forget the radiator. The steam has been on here for ten years. No human can turn this off.
Hehe. Well, I got my triangles. (sitting on the couch)
Oh, sure, my Black Hawks jacket. I love my Black Hawks jacket.
Whoa, whoa, you're not getting in my car with gummy shoes.
But it--eh.. It was here, I'm tellin' you, an' w--w--it was really here! The, there was, a, bar, and a, an' a dance floor..
You know how hot it gets there? Like 150 degrees. Your skin is gonna be simmering with boils.
Yeah, and she's going to find I'm a moron. You know, people think I'm smart, but I'm not smart.
Svenjolly. (licking a little bit of peanut butter from his finger)
I just feel terrible This is just terrible.
Have you seen the new addition to the Guggenheim?
No something is bunk and then you debunk it.
Apparently the Seinfelds' are too good for us. I shouldn't say anything bad about your uh your partner.
It's a performance, Jerry. Like what you do.
There's gotta be more to life than this. What gives you pleasure?
You know, you have to know how to do that. You cant have people shoving their arms into a six-hundred degree oven!
Look at that. They got lobster on the menu. Who would order a lobster here. I mean, do they bring a lobster in everyday hoping *todays* the day.
All right, look. I'm getting the Chow Fung. You don't have to have any.
Absolutely. You're telling me there's no room to move on pasta. All starches are a scam.
Well, if he can regift, why can't you degift?
Shst, You should take the test for me.
It became very clear to me sitting out there today, that every decision I've ever made, in my entire life, has been wrong. My life is the complete opposite of everything I want it to be. Every instinct I have, in every of aspect of life, be it something to wear, something to eat ... It's all been wrong. (chuckles) Everywhere.
Well what did you want her to do, you left it on the night table.
There's no house! It's a lie! There's no solarium. There's no Prickly Pete. There's no other solarium.
"What day is today?....Aw. ..Tuesday! Damn it. I shouldn't have worked out today. Mr Wilhem has called a big meeting and now I'm gonna be sweating through the whole thing."
So call her up and tell her to bring you another one. She'll be delighted to talk to you.
I guess I should be, but Im not.
Wait, wait a second, what are you doing?
(thinking of the moans) Heh. (Karen takes another puff of her cigarette) You seem like you really enjoyed your Risotto. (chuckles) You have a very contented air over there. (chuckles again) You look very contented, very satisfied. (pauses) Are you satisfied?
Yes well unfortunately you'll never get the chance to find out.
Not necessarily. Mustard lends itself to the squeeze.
(to Elaine) He asked you to get the mail?
Don't jinx it! Don't jinx (trails off quietly in elation)
Hey, Tim. Quick question. Is it normal for your teeth to make noises, like a hissing or a chirping?
Well, they hurt him bad. Really hurt his feelings. It's a long story. I- I don't like to talk about it, but I swore then that I would never work for big broker-houses. See, all they care about is money. I'm about more than money, I'm about people, always gone my own way and I've never looked back.
There's an easy move go from screwin' you behind your back to screwin' you right to your face.
yeah that's right. I like it. He's such a cool guy
With the orange hair, and the big clown shirt with the ruffles...
All right, no more lies. Elaine is been chosen to represent the Upper West Side in the next Biosphere project.
Helping people... Of course. Of course! It makes perfect sense! How could I *not* be doing this!? I am gonna help somebody, Dammit!
Absolutely, uh, lets see there's, uh, Vandelay Industries, I just saw them. I got very close there. very close.
What d'you mean, let 'em go? They're spending all my money.
This woman drove us out of our minds
(on an imaginary microphone) Uh, no, not at this time.
You really think this looks O.K. on me?
Why'd you pick Hoover? Was he that interesting to talk to?
(Fed up with his parents) Actually, I think I'm pretty clear on it.
There was nothing else on. Oh, the left arm.. the left arm.
You're not out there! You can't be, because *I* am out there. And if I see *you* out there, there's not enough voltage in this world to electroshock me back into coherence!
It's like the manager coming out and asking you for the ball.
Yeah. (another pause) Not that I care, one way or the other, but these doctors today really do amazing things, you know, if you were so inclined. And again, I'm not suggesting.
Because, I've got the coat. I can sit in the car and not get cold.
Excuse me, darling, do I detect a Portuguese accent?
She had this throaty , sexy kind of whisper.
So what?! She still gave you advice; what's the difference if she's not Chinese?!?!
Ha, I don't know who she's looking for. I don't know. I'll tell you something. She's very particular, your daughter. Very particular. What is she looking for some big hot shot businessman? Well I've got my pride too. I'm not going to beg her.
Yeah, my cleaning lady's Portuguese. I must've picked it up.
What, you don't want me to hold your keys?
Hi, I was just uh... I just had one little question about uh, my assignment.
This is a huge project involving lots of numbers and papers and folders.
Look, Deena, I know you think I'm crazy, but I'm not. This is just a series of bad coincidences.
Well I am. Couldn't you try to go through some of that stuff I put in your shoebox?
The show! Forget about the show! We should take the idea to a different network
It doesn't matter if it's more comfortable. It's wrong.
Well, I was exaggerating a bit, just for effect.
Oh, Noooo, I'm so sorry. It's the MOOPS. The correct answer is, The MOOPS.
Uh huh. Uh huh! I think you spoke to your little friend Rachel, that's what I think.
I know. I just sort of leaned on it so it would look like it was mine.
He's got a gun! He's got a gun! Get out of the way! (Tries to flee the bar in a mad panic. The audience in the club also goes nuts and heads for the exits. Jerry stands onstage, perplexed.)
Oh, no, that's just the old, uh, the old handicap acting up.
Alright, alright, I'll go on the date, but that's that.
I can't tell ya how much I appreciate this.
Yeah, well you have to maintain the same disposition too. You can't start acting any differently. You have to be nice.
Tennis courts? W-w-what about the yard? Where do they have the gang fights?
No. I am not giving my code to anyone for any reason.
(crying from the onion) You'll see I'm right.
Right, I got news. You ready? (deep breath) Gary Fogel had cancer.
I think Im getting tired of it. I mean is that all it does? Hello? La-la-la?
I'm not getting on a regular plane now - I'm all psyched up to go on a private jet. No way I'm getting on a regular plane.
Yeah. I may have stepped on her arm, too, I don't know.
Ohh, hey there, young fella. (They shake hands) What's your major?
I mean, now she thinks that I'm one of these guys that love her. Nobody wants to be with somebody that loves them.
You'll have your turn! The truth must be heard. (Plays back the tape.) That's all there was. And yet, it speaks volumes. A low rumple. A metallic 'squink.' A 'glonk.' Someone crying out..."Dear God!" Let's start with, uh...with you, Wyck.
I know, they're out of their minds! It's fantastic!
(Staring at the doll) This doll (Pointing) looks like my mother.
I bought a new recliner with a fridge build right in to it.
No not vast (he pronounces it as "vost")
(As the Twix starts to move) Ha, ha, ha, ha! (The Twix gets stuck in the spindle right before falling. George begins to pound the machine) Come on! Jump!
You're not a doctor. You shouldn't even have books like this.
(excited) Great news! I showed the pilot to Kramer's Japanese friends. They loved it!
Where did this come from all of a sudden?
Oh yeah, but that has nothing to do with it.
(agitated) Alright, I gotta try and talk my mother into taking him off my hands.
See her tonight. See her tomorrow. Go. Knock yourself out. Shes too crazy for me.
Alright, just make sure he reserves the good chair for me. Wait, what are you gonna tell him about the clanking noise in the car?
Yes, she's pretty. What difference does it make?
(back-pedalling) No, he, he didnt actually tell me that, uh, we were talking about that commercial  in fact I think I brought it up because I like that commercial. No, he, he would never tell me anything. He never discusses anything. Hes, hes like a clam. Youre not gonna mention this, to him...
Then, the last person to leave is Wilhelm. He sees my car, he figures I'm burning the midnight oil. Between the two of them, they think I'm working an 18 hour day! (he stands there with his hands on his hips, a wide grin - laughing.)
Oh, thanks, Bobby. (To Celia) Well, I guess I'll see you in four days.
God! She's cooking dinner for God! She's yelling and screaming, and the next thing I know, she throws a big can of chocolate syrup all over my new red shirt.
Oh no no no. He's deeply in love, and I was just about to break up with her when she told me.
All right, let me just... I'm gonna grap an apple.
I don't know, honey. What do you want to get? [in babying voice] I want you to get anything you want...'cause I love you so much. I want you to be happy. Okay, sweetie?
Yeah,yeah!! I'll pick you up right now.....All right All right....Hey! gotta go.
No, stings the throat. Anyway, so I was coming along here, and I felt like a piece of cake, you know? But then I thought, it's morning, I should really have a muffin. I like those chocolate chip ones. Then I figured, well, they're really both cake. So I, uh, I sat on that bench for a little while, twenty minutes or an hour, and then I figured, check and see what you were up to. (a thought occurs to him) Wait a minute, wait a minute. The broad jump! The broad jump over the pothole on Eighty-sixth Street!
You think she could be an 'it'? Could she be an 'it'?
I'll tell you something, I've never seen a pilot script as funny as this!
Oh yeah, when are you gonna execute that plan?
Now if I wanna see anything I gotta wear these.
Ah you have no idea of the magnitude of this thing. If she is allowed to infiltrate this world, then George Costanza as you know him, Ceases to Exist! You see, right now, I have Relationship George, but there is also Independent George. That's the George you know, the George you grew up with -- Movie George, Coffee shop George, Liar George, Bawdy George.
I tried to tear it from the side, you can't get a good grip here. You gotta do it like a bag of chips.
Well, I am just a T-bone kinda guy. Love that T-bone. In fact, you might as well call me--
It's a little unusual. So, uh, Susan and I were thinking, uh, dinner at our house Saturday night. Just the four of us.
Who doesn't like cashmere? Find me one person in the world that doesn't like cashmere. It's too expensive.
Im aware of you. (to Jerry) All right, lets go (opens the bathroom door) Lets go!
What? Oh I spilled some food on it.
So you think you can put the suit aside and hold it for me?
Who are you to play God!? Every man's time comes! If his number is up, who are you to interfere!?
(To Rachel) And, uh, you eat eggs, right?
But in the zoo, you know, they might, put a woman in there with me to uh.. you know, get me to mate.
Hey, I've eaten frogs, so nobody's perfect. Anyway-
So I finally stop and say, "Tatiana, I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but I think it would be best if I left".
If only she could get fired. Is there any way that could happen? I mean I know how to get myself fired.
Because of the day before. It's a long story.
(gets up and picks a mirror) Yes. Yes, it's white. Why it's white.
My whole life is ruined because of the (Mocking, bitter tone) "puffy shirt".
(Gloating) Hey, you got any extra furniture down there? I need some more stuff to fill that extra bedroom with the walk-in closet. (Smiles)
Knock it off, just sit in your seat over there you're distracting me. We're making incredible time here. I once went into Kennedy Airport from West 81st Street to in uh, in 15 minutes. hu uh. Oh, here hold this. It's uh, ten dollars for the tolls.
(panicked and rushed) Jerry! The Japanese guys had sake in the hot-tub! You gotta get 'em outta the drawers and get 'em down here, or I don't have a focus group to sell the pilot to Japanese TV!
No, no. No, no, no. (determined) We're staying on me. We haven't solved anything yet.
When you're talking about a movie like "Beaches", moving from the chair to the couch , . . . that's quite a voyage.
Ah, excuse me, Vice-president Coco, no one cares about your Gammy.
Yeah, I would. It's just, you know, I just ate a whole pot roast.
Yeah, yeah. He went into the bedroom and started sobbing.
I can't sell the book. It's been marked.
(chuckles) Really? Well, we'll just see about that. Ta-ta, Tut-tle.
(standing) Oh yeah, Reilly? (smugly) Well, the jerk store called. They're running outta you
Lunch is fine at the beginning then you move on to dinner. you don't move back to lunch. It's like being demoted. I'll never do another crossword puzzle with her again. I know it.
I'm gonna get some more of these kosher cocktail franks.. (leaves)
(To Jerry) We got work to do. What about the meeting?
I feel like a huge weights been lifted off my shoulders. I... I... I feel happy! Kramer, I dont know how to thank you!
No, you go Guggenheim. I'm not much of a Guggenheim.
Well, Play Now is through playing. They turned the heat way up in my office. They tried to sweat me out.
Wait a minute, she did a skin cancer screening at Peterman?
(Very loud in the direction of a waiter) I'm gonna need a coffee here. Very hot! Boiling!
You know what I would like to do? I would really like to have sex with a tall woman. I mean really tall. Like a like a giant Like six five.
That's really very nice of you, Eva. Thank you.
Well, I know when I'm a little strapped, I sometimes drop off my rent check having forgotten to sign it. That could buy us some time.
I know. That's the point. If it's gonna get sexual, it should get sexual with you.
Shes a pig. The woman's a pig, what wrong with her--
You tellin' 'em about the butler story? Is that beautiful or what? Hey, sorry I'm late. (Looks at Rita) Russell?
"BECAUSE IF HE CAN'T JUMP. THERE GOES MY SNEAKER BUSINESS!!"
Oh I was not. The BUBBLE BOY was tried to kill me.
Oh yeah. So wait, wait. A half-hour later Im back in the office, I tell Lloyd the whole story. He says, So why dont you call her? I says, I cant. I couldnt, I couldnt do it right then. For me to ask a woman out I gotta get into a mental state like the karate guys before they break the bricks. So Lloyd calls me a wuss.
Of course he is. There's got to be houses for rent in Tuscany. Do you know how big Tuscany is?
Look, we're wasting our time here! We're a half-hour late, they've probably took it off the board already.
Oh, I love full lips. Something you can really put the lipstick on.
Oh, no...no, that's very bad for the kidneys.
Okay, look, Audrey, before you take the bandage off just remember that I was the one that encouraged you to do this, you know? Now that you're gonna be a great beauty, let's not forget how this all began. You know, like if you'd listened to your friend, Elaine,
What happened to the screen door? It blew off again?
All right, all right. Thats it. Im gonna go down there.
(Vowing) Well, I'll tell you this, though - I am never doing.. that , again.
Why don't they have salsa on the table?
I gotta stay one step ahead of Neil.
This woman just set me up for a job!
Uh, let me ask you a question. Could you, uh, expand the space underneath a desk to give it a little more headroom?
George, don't make me get tough with you. Whu, hu, hu, hu huuuu (raises arms) Who says that? She is really cool. What do you think? You think she likes me?
Yes it is. She just took credit for my salad. That's not right.
So, what's in the cooler? (flips open the lid)
So he walks out of the stall, he's been talking the whole time.
First class doesn't make it anymore. Now you get on the phone with Kimbrough, tell him what happened and tell him to get another plane down here, but this time, the good one - the Ted Danson plane.
tsh (snorts) Ah, yeah, we've - we've talked . . . I believe I can speak for the both of us on this.
I'm cheap? You think I'm CHEAP? How could you say that to me? I can't believe this. How could you say that to me?
Told me to "Go to hell!" and I took the bus home.
Oh, very refreshing. (Thinking again) Sex is like joining a private club. I'll be the same me tomorrow, but suddenly, the no trespassing sign will be gone.
A fan? I would drape myself in velvet if it were socially acceptable. And look at this, hardwood floors!
Well I'm not starting up a whole new wardrobe now!!!
Is there any work being done? Is there any rubbing, touching, finger manipulation on the other person, and if so, who's making the request?
Oh, well, uh. Gary told me you said hi.
Yes. Very nice to have had her to mention... (starting to leave)
(To a passing waitress) I'll have some coffee and a doughnut.
Well, if she was a criminal and you had to describe her to a police sketch artist...
I left it at Heather's. Are these alive? (pounding on glass display)
look at this guy. Does he have to stretch in here?
(con't) A-Anyway, I was thinking we would take two cars up to the cabin and that way if one of wanted to stay you know...
(hesitant) Uh, Mr Wilhelm. Uh, about the project...
All right, I gotta get going. My parents are expecting me.
So I set up a screening, everyone takes their shirt off and click, I snap me a shot of a bear-chested Kruger.
Oh my God. I just remembered where I left my retainer in second grade. I'll see ya. (He throws finished Rubik's cube to Jerry and he exits. Kramer enters)
These are not "scraps." These are historic remains of a once Great Society of Hair.
I gotta go zoo. I feel like I could set more of my own schedule.
No, not really. I'm just saying this to you because I like to hear myself talk. Yes, really!
But I mean look at him. He's gotta be on his feet like that all day? That's brutal. I think I'm gonna say something to your uncle.
You dont have to call that! Thats a rule!
[to himself] Argh! [to Susan] Susan! Hi! Oh, boy! What are you doing here?!
"These pretzels are making me thirsty"? That was one line! You got fired!
She dragged me down to that warehouse on the waterfront in Brooklin to see one of her "performances".
(animated) It failed here! Because, here, every time you turn on a TV, all you see is four morons sitting round an apartment, whining about their dates!
What did you put the Pez dispenser on her leg for in the first place?
Do I really have to buy her something?
Oh, Hey, hey, hey! That's great! That's very nice. You know we've been waiting twenty minutes for you people?! What do you think, you're Mussolini?!
(ecstatic) What? You're moving to Florida!?! That's wonderful! I'm so happy! (pause) For you! I'm so happy for you! Oh, what do you need this cold weather for?
Course, I wouldn't, I mean uh, the guy is uh, well obviously (to Cynthia, as she passes) the guy has his problems.
Again with the checked out. I'm not going to the doctor. If I don't to the doctor, then nothing will happen to me. If I go he might find something.
What's it gonna be? ... You hear that?
(quieter desperation) They took my belt, Jerry. I got nothing to hold my pants up. (listens) Well, you gotta come over here now! Just tell 'em what we talked about, how I, how I, I didn't do the project.
So all right I'll speak to you through Jerry and everything.
Tell me about it. I went out with this girl last week. First I had to pay for dinner, then--
Well, anyway, the book club meets tomorrow, Mr. Temple.
(Makes a gesture saying he understands. The man nods) But how.. uh..?
I dont know why you even bother with this ping pong guy, Ill tell you that.
Well no not yet, you gotta buy french stamps (pauses) I-I'll reimburse you of course.
Because my parents happen to be two pretty wonderful people.
This is totally different! That was my secret, this is Jerry's secret! There's...there's attorney-client priveleges here! If I play it by your rule, no one'll ever confide in me again, I'll be cut out of the loop!
My name is not mentioned in this blurb...
Hello? I can take an hour off your hands. Give the kids a chance to see a real live Yankee.
Yeah. Cotton breathes, you see, it's much softer. Imagine playing games and your team is five degrees cooler than the other team. Don't you think that would be an advantage? They're cooler, they're more comfortable...they're happier - they're gonna play better.
Well, you know, I shouldn't have let you into Kramer's, now you want to go into Elaine's...she entrusted me with her spare keys, how can I just let you in?
(picking up his coat) Awright, I'm heading home.
Can't find them. That's marvelous. The dance continues.
The, uh, actor that played Jesus made some odd choices.
Oh I beg to differ. My father took great pride in his appearance, he was a very handsome man, a casanova really.
Don't go. Kramer! Come back. I got great news. Well, I did it.
No, no, no, I dont want to carry it around all night. Ill pick it up later.
Yeah, hold on. I'm, uh, I'm just trying to get a reading on my dashboard compass. Where are my parents?
(entering) Last night, huh? Was that something, or was that something?
All right, Dad, we're five blocks from the house. Sit sideways.
You know, I think I could have played with dolls if their were dolls in the house. It seems like fun to me. It doesn't seem like a gender thing. I think I would like to play with dolls. What's so terrible?
I can't go in there. I can't face the bubble boy.
Would it kill him to check up on us? No - drops off the meals and that's it. I realize we're prisoners, but we're still entitled to catsup.
Whatever. (George looks to the table) Hey new tape recorder?
Atlantic City? (thinks) Yes! Yes! I will go to Atlantic City. I'm in. I'm down.
(to the cashier) Excuse me, I gave you a twenty dollar bill and you only actually gave me change for a ten.
THIS is your daughter? My God! My God! I I hope you don't mind my saying. She is breathtaking.
One mile from the exit it starts shaking, really violently shaking, like it's having a nervous breakdown. It completely stopped dead.
My heart! My heart! (To Assistant) Where you going? Are you crazy?!
When is it going to be my turn, Jerry? When do I get my 15 minutes? I want my 15 minutes!
I got a big problem here, Jerry. The tapes are worthless.
What, you don't think I can attract beautiful, intelligent women?
Elaine, I'm, I'm shocked. I'm shocked. Here I go out in the spirit of the season (Elaine looking like she's not buying a word of it) and spend all my savings to buy you the most beautiful Christmas sweater I have ever seen to show my appreciation to you at Christmas and this is the thanks that I get at Christmas.
This is the life! Isn't it, huh, kid?
This is nighmare. Kramer how long was I on?
Why does everything have to be 'us'? Is there no 'me' left? Why can't there be some things just for me? Is that so selfish?
Wha - what happened? What are you doing back so soon?
I don't know where you're getting this from. I....you're serious aren't you? Oh, (laughing) you see? You see, you just don't know my sense of humor. Dan, don't I joke around all the time?
(to the waitress bringing his doughnut) And a slice of devil's food cake.
S, uh, Superman - he, uh, built the fortress of solitude up at the North Pole, to, uh, you know, sort of get away from it all..
(ON PHONE) It's a '76 Chevy Impala. They stole it right in front of the hospital. I saw the guy drive off in it. Well he's about five feet tall, hairless, pink complexion.. (Elaine puts her finger on her nose) looks like a pig. Yeah, alright alright, thank you, thank you. (Kramer enters) So any word from the "pig-man"?
So, how do you like the way I talked you into comin' down here?
Yes, yes, I definitely waited. But let me say this Once he passes on that option, that 'God bless you' is up for grabs.
Oh, this is unbelievable. I'm stuck. Every time I think I'm out, they pull me back in.
Well, then, I am gonna have to ask you to turn your key.
No, no, I mean, driving Susan to lesbianism.
No! My ticket?! You gave my ticket to Horneck?
Hu humm? i suppose we could go to Lincoln Center and I'd be wearing sneakers and jeans and that would be fine too.
Because, if you ever see her and it comes up, we have to be in sync. Hmm?
Sure, well uh, you know I'll check in with you next week uh, I gotta run now because I got a full plate this afternoon. All right, really go to uh,.
Because Im not Latvian Orthodox. Her parents wont let her get involved with anyone who isnt Latvian Orthodox.
Thanks a lot. I'm really late. My parents are waiting in front of my building and we're stuck here.
Pssh. Would the protg pick up stuff for the mentor?
I love the chop sticks. I, I personally prefer a fork but they look very nice.
She, uh, went shopping for some shoes for the wedding and, yada yada yada, I'll see her in six to eight months. (Kramer and Julie enter)
Hmm, what's he doin' in the city today?
No. Youd be surprised. You dont recover that quickly from a nose job.
Jerry, let me tell you something, "A man without hand is not a man." I got so much hand I'm coming out of my gloves. I got to thank Kramer.
You know, they say ostrich has less fat, but you eat more of it.
(Embarrassed) That's all I could find. (A moment passes) Would you mind getting the door?
We ordered the wedding invitations today,, Nothing can stop it now. Nothing. It's here! It's happening. Can I do this? I can't do this...Look at me. Look at me I can't do this, I can't do this (manic) Help me Jerry, help me.
(to himself) You can't tell much from those pictures.
You know, you're going along, you think everything's all right and all of a sudden you get that tap. (George taps his own shoulder). You know it's like pfffff (whistling sound), all right that's enough, you're through.
Oh, I think it is! I think that's exactly what it is!
Well, if she keeps horsing around with that tractor--
Just put it on! All right now, remember she had her nails done today so remark how you like the color. And if you need me you beep me, all right. Here you go, hey, hey, hey, hey...(sprays Binaca into Jerry's mouth.) Go get'em you're a tiger!
The... drivel... parts. Oh my gosh, I just realized  I have to make a phone call. I-I cant believe- Would you-
(upset) Could you put a little thought into this? Jerry's gone, you could humour me. He humours me.
Are, are you sure this is decaf? Wheres the orange indicator?
(taking the phone from Elaine) Jerry, why is Elaine getting your mail?
Well, you never know. (picks up more shrimp) Let's see how many I can fit in my mouth.
That's perfect! He's a zoo guy! He take's care of animals. C-Can I bring the squirrel by?
Of course he should consider it, but now is not the time!
Hey, I am not here for rage. I'm here for revenge.
The better looking they are, the faster they go! I mean, I see they out there on the street, they're zooming around, like a blur. Like they have a motor on their ass.
Yeah!, a doodle of me...look at the size of the nose , the ears, all my features are distorted.
So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified! But I pressed on -- and as I made my way passed the breakers a strange calm came over me. I-I don't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment  I was a Marine Biologist!
How could she leave us alone with this lunatic? Ten more minutes, and thats it! Im leaving. I have to tell you, this guy scares me.
I don't understand what the big deal is. They let you try on pants.
(at dinner with his cousin) Some more merlot?
Yes. Live, dammit. Live! Every precious moment as if this was the last year of your life. Because in many ways...it is. (There's a knock at the door.) Excuse me.
All right, we'll be a little late, I,m not taking a cab.
There's a hundred different things here. What's the difference between these two? (They each grab a box and check the ingredients) You got propylparabin?
Hey, did you see that whale thing on TV last night?
I believe strongly in that as you know.
He just walked away! And once again I'm standing here like a little man. Well not this time! (George leaves the store and follows the dog owner) You! Dog man!
. All right , just give me my car and let me get the hell out of here.
Yeah. Yes! I just haven't seen you in a long time.
Did you see the way she pointed at the check? She gave me the finger.
Just a suggestion. (chuckles and walks back to the yelling guy)
You know, all these years, I've always wanted to see the two of you get back together.
Well, a lot of people keep popcorn in the house.
I'm sorry, uh, it's not like I'm gonna see something I've never seen before.
Well, what was I supposed to do? Get out of the shower, put on my bathrobe? Go all the way down to the other end? Come all the way back?
Yep, and the photo was all fixed and back on his desk, no thanks to you.
I was trying to stick the landing. (indistinct) ...was right around here.
No. This is not cotton. Here, lemme see. (Tries to look at the tag on the uniform. Tartabull gets creeped out and resists.) Will you stop it? (Looks at the tag.) Oh. Of course. Polyester!
That's it. This is it. I'm done. Through. It's over. I'm gone. Finished. Over. I will never work for you again. Look at you. (laughing) You think you're an important man? Is that what you think? You are a laughingstock. You are a joke. These people are laughing at you. You're nothing! You have no brains, no ability, nothing! (knocking object over on desk) I quit!
Hey, you know what else is playing here? ``Rochelle Rochelle''.
(to the executives) Excuse me. Did you hire the Sunshine Carpet Cleaners?
It's a very complicated move! I couldn't remember it all.
Do you think she gets to take any of those little bars of soap home?
please please I don't want to die up here. please, stop moving that's all I'm asking.. Kramer!!
Yeah, like I'm going to risk my job with the New York Yankees to make a few extra bucks. (winks)
Well let me hear....( they struggle for the headphones)
Well, sorry I missed that, uh, charity thing. But this was one of those truly glorious Hampton weekends that you always hear about.
I think I can sum up the show for you with one word NOTHING.
So what, he's got a couple of good jokes.
Alright! Please, please! I cannot have this constant bickering!.. Stress is very damaging to the epidermis! Now, I have an important photo session in the morning - my hands have got to be in tip-top shape, so please - keep the television down, and the conversation to a minimum.
Hi. I-I really should be getting back to my fianc, you know, we, uh, we had this big fight yesterday and, uh, well she, she wants to-to know my secret code. I-I don't know, I can't tell her. The funny thing is, you know, I would really love to tell someone 'cause it's killing me. You uh, you wanna know what it is? It's Bosco. You know, the chocolate syrup? I love that stuff, I pour it in milk, it's my favorite drink. Hoo-hoo, boy, that is a relief!
(on the answering machine) Jerry, what's happening? Come on, pick up the phone.
I'd like to sleep with a LOT of other women.
All right, let's postpone it. Let's get out of here.
(Praising Leo's stealing) Alright, Leo! Stickin' it to the man!
Why?! Because you were stabbed, and.. got coffee thrown in your face, and.. uh.. (Points to Alan's bandaged forehead)
Wa, uh, thank you sir, you know I am not quite sure I'm right for it.
So I'm sure whatever germs it landed on were knocked out, and by the time the rest of them realised what was going on, you had already grabbed it out.
I've got to tell you, I'm really disappointed in Lupe.
So, what? We're gonna do nothing now, this is crazy.
Ha! (grabs his coat and exits the apartment)
One... (Glenda seeing George is serious; gets up and leaves)
No, no. I-I just want us to be... together.
Let me ask you a question. This new move. Is there a knuckle involved in any way?
That's no tragedy! How many people do you lose on a normal cruse? 30? 40?! Kramer, can I take a look at that book? (Starts walking tward the door. Kramer grabs his food, and follows)
(to Jerry) Why dont you just turn it inside out?
Ah, shut up, Jerry. My parents think they can ignore me. Heh heh. Well, they better think again.
I want you to find out is she likes me.
(to Jerry) How could we not hear anything? What's with this Russel? What's he doing? (Jerry raises his arms and shoulders like he doesn't know)
Sorry, you don't know what's going on out there! (looks at Owen) Who's he?
I don't know. Perhaps I can better serve the world this way.
You ask me here to have lunch, tell me you slept with Elaine, and then say you're not in the mood for details. Now you listen to me. I want details and I want them right now. I don't have a job, I have no place to go. You're not in the mood? Well you get in the mood!
Its been a long night. You go home and get some sleep.
That's right. I got his whole car downstairs.
You can do better than me. You could throw a dart out the window and hit someone better than me. I'm no good!
All right. So, you hold out your money, speak your soup in a loud, clear voice, step to the left and receive.
Oh - comfort, schmomfort. Listen, Father, can I ask you a question? In a terrible time like this...who would I get the death certificate from?
Well, I gotta do somethin'. (Walks over to bathroom. Kramer enters)
All right, all right ( Goes to the bathroom)
Hey, I am not a prude sweetheart. I swing with the best of them. (snapping his fingers 5 times)
This is fantastic. Man, what a weekend. Swimming, lobster for dinner...
See, Steinbrenner is like the first guy in, at the crack of dawn. He sees my car, he figures I'm the first guy in
oh, . . .because she handed you the bag. I could have handed you the bag. She happened to pick it up at the restaurant even though, . . .
I mean, we're not stupid, right? We know when something's funny!
Lemme tell you something, that Jerry Lewis? You wonder how some of these people get to the top? It's ideas like this! Brilliant! Hah-hah! (Notices that the briefcase is damaged.) Look at this - what the hell happened? The whole side is damaged here...and the lock is broken.
Thank you very much. You just stand over there, I?ll stand over here.
Because he made a big deal about how I understand everything immediately. That's what impressed him.
Let me show you something, take a look at this... (Another guy at the party interrupts.)
Because! Because, as the leader...if I die...then all hope is lost! Who would lead? The clown? Instead of castigating me, you should all be thanking me. What kind of a topsy-turvy world do we live in, where-where heroes are cast as villains? Brave men as cowards?
I read somewhere that this Brentano's is the place to meet girls in New York.
Oh, I was trying to make a point.
Oh, well I didn't know you went into Queens Jerry.
Yeah, I know that. (clears throat) Could you start, working?
( to Jerry) What about the letter, should I think about the letter?
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, go. Go about your business, I'll just wander around.
You know you buy a big salad for somebody it would be nice if they knew it.
Krama. Open up! I--I know you're in there!
If she doesnt show up, we cant possibly have dinner with him alone.
You're not letting him win. He wins till you're forty.
Ok, ok, fine! It's changed, it's not really the point. Anyway, I'm thinking of making a big move.
Oh, you're fine... you're fine. (looking at Tom in the back and then quieter to Jerry) So you think this guy playing Kramer took the raisins?
She's right, I heard Kramer got mugged out on the suburbs on a baby-sitting gig.
And Ill tell you something else, Im not even going to ask you. I want to know. But Im not gonna ask. Youll tell me when you feel comfortable. So what was it? Four hundred? Five hundred? Did you pay five hundred for this? (Jerry coyly ignores Georges questions, while George grows increasingly serious.) Over six? Cant be seven. Dont tell me you paid seven hundred dollars for this jacket! Did you pay seven hundred dollars for this jacket? Is that what youre saying to me? You are sick! Is that what you paid for this jacket? Over seven hundred? What did you pay for this jacket?! I wont say anything. I wanna know what you paid for this jacket! Oh my God! A thousand dollars?! You paid a thousand dollars for this jacket?! All right, fine. (George heads for the door.) Im walking outta here right now thinking you paid a thousand dollars for this jacket, unless you tell me different. (Jerry remains silent.) Oh, ho! All right! Ill tell you what, if you dont say anything in the next five seconds, Ill know it was over a thousand.
I knew it!! (shuts cab door) I predicted it! (hits cab roof twice, it drives off) Saw both of them today! What a disaster! I'm runnin' all over Queens. First I saw my mother. We had lunch together. Never had... LUNCH with my mother before--it's like a date! Then we drive down to Kew Gardens! Tons of traffic! I see my father. We played "Clue"! All day with this! [Kew Gardens (see links at end of script)]
Yes, it was purple, I liked it, I dont actually recall considering the buttons.
What, you're gonna take her word over mine? I'm your best friend!
(almost gleeful) After Dinkins lost the election, he had a complete nervous breakdown. They had to lock him up.
Lupe. That's very nice, very nice. Listen, are you going to be making up the bed in the morning?
Yeah. You could base a character on me.
Oh yeah, real cool. You're a cool guy.
Bear with you! This is a parking lot PEOPLE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO GET
So--ah, Kramer. Why'd you ask me out to dinner? (amused) An' why Pomodoro?
Where you going? I-I thought I could count on you for a little compassion.
I don't understand things were going so great. What happened? Something must have happened.
All right, enough! Enough! From now on, no more yada yada's. Just give me the full story.
Hey. I've kept the same job for more than two years. It's not luck. Elaine, have you ever sent a racy photograph of yourself to anyone?
I, I couldn't help but notice that uh you don't have a chair.
You know a lost and found could be a good idea.
Ehh. (nostalgic) Remember that summer at Dairy Queen where I cooled my feet in the soft-serve machine?
What was the tallest woman you ever slept with?
(starts to try to get passed Jerry and Elaine) Alright get out of my way. (Jerry and Elaine push him back, George very annoyed) Alright don't make me get physical here!
(Gets up to leave) Well, scintillating as always.
Besides, Steven Koren has the highest of aspirations. He wants to be (pauses for effect) an architect.
I mean, I could understand if there was something else playing, but it's this or nothing.
That's right, you heard me. Get out! You are ruining this whole experience for me!
Shhh! Listen, you gotta do me a favor. Give me your wallet. I'll give it back to you later.
Oh I hate to hear this. That kind of growth really irritates me.
It's not contest. The guy had nothing! The ship went down, he got into a life boat, I mean, come on.
Hi! Mr. West, this is my friend Elaine--
Uh, I'm just selling some of Dad's things, (looking into Kramer's eyes) that's what he would have wanted.
Ade, ahh, ahh, ah ... Im giving you a raise!
What are you talking about? How can you sit there and look me in the eye and tell that me you're not worried?! Don't you have any *sense*?!! Don't you have a brain!? Are you so completely senile that you don't know what you're talkin about Anymore!!?!
I told them to meet me in front of my building at six-fifteen.
Aw, that's a fun age. (Jerry looks at George distastefully.)
Mr. Thomassoulo during times of great stress, people are capable of super human strength. Have you ever seen the Incredible Hulk, sir?
Woah, back it up, back it up. Beep, beep, beep. Tractor story?
I leave you alone for two seconds, and this is what you do! I trusted you!
No. But I was the only one at the table that didn't get violently ill.
This is our new Vice-president of Acquisitions, sir.
Mister Seinfeld? What about Mister Costanza? I'm not here?
Sure. Thank you for coming in. (Tom eats some raisins)
No, Julie, Julie, don't insult me. You know, what difference does it make who pays for lunch. It's totally meaningless.
Jerry, I've been preparing for this moment my entire life.
Her scalp was clean. She had a nice skull. There just wasn't a lot of hair on it.
They want you to do a TV show?
They'll make you a Big Salad. What do you think, they're the only one's that make a Big Salad?
All right. (throws his coat back down on the seat and sits down opposite them)
How hard could it be? You make a little contribution, you have a ceremony. I am going to think about this. I am really going to think about this.
Oh, come on. What, are you kidding? GEORGE I'm much more comfortable criticizing people behind there backs. Anyway, look who's talking. You just broke up with with Melanie last week because she "shuushed you" while you were watching TV.
What if he left you a used Kleenex, what's that, a valentine? Now you go up to him and you tell him that if he's thinking of turning me in, that I got the goods on him!
All right! All right. I'll tell you what. How about this? Got the date; March 21st, the first day of spring.
Oh (snorts) Articulate....Me? I've never articulated anything, i'm completely incoherent.
You're giving me the "it's not you, it's me" routine? I invented "it's not you, it's me". Nobody tells me it's them not me, if it's anybody it's me.
(offers his) Oh, you want to taste mine.
" That guy was amazing, he could dunk and he was my height...What was his name again?"
(Not really wanting to embellish) ..I stopped by the house to drop the car off, and I went inside for a few minutes.. Nobody was there - they're supposed to be working. (Jerry and Elaine look at each other - enjoying the story) My mother had a Glamour magazine, I started leafing through it..
all right! rock-climbing! J..just the 2 of us? alright! hey I'll make some sandwiches, what what do you like? tuna? peanut butter?
What! There's no signs here! This is an outrage!
So I still haven't heard about that job.
I haven't even met the fiancee! Whatever! (Leaves for washroom)
(to the saleswoman) You know honey for an unadvertised sale, you're doing a lot of yapping about it.
No (snorts - Laughing nervously)... I'm gonna wear black shoes.
Well I I ..put a lot of thought into this and I think I would like you to sign a prenuptual agreement.
Well, Steven, I, uh.. (All the sudden, a small gang steps out of nowhere, surrounding George)
Do you ever just get down on your knees and thank god that you know me and have access to my dementia?
(claps hands triumphantly) We might have an 'it'!
They're -- They're killing independent George! And they're, they're all in on it! World's are colliding!
Well, actually you did miss one nugget of entertainment. (Pause) Have you ever seen Elaine dance?
I know a little. Besides, what do you have to know?
(humble) Well, if you must know, shhhe, was my fiance, Susan. May she rest in peace.
Well, maybe they're done with it. I could go pick it up.
Of course. But I really wanna leave my mark this time, you know, uh. I wanna walk away from the Yankees with people saying 'Wow! Now that guy got canned!'
It's a huge problem, Jerry. The hardest part about having sex with a woman is getting her to come back to your place! He's already got that.
On an elevator? You met a woman on an elevator?
Right. And, and to cover my nervousness I started eating an apple, because I think if they hear you chewing on the other end of the phone, it makes you sound casual.
Ya it used to be right in the middle of single Jeopardy and now they do it right after single Jeopardy.
Umm, Im not. Its just a sociological experiment!
Oh come on? No come on. She took off her hat and there she was (waving his hand over his head) hello. It was like I was looking at myself in the mirror.
No no no, that's in the right position.
Be careful, you're getting blood all over the car.
Up again?! This is incredible! Im.. Im getting it.
I mean it's gotten to the point where I'm flirting with operators on the phone. I almost made a date with one.
I think it's neat. You don't hear that much about god anymore.
I can't believe she got involved with a shrink.
It's like you're livin' in the Playboy Mansion! Did she, uh, did she frolic?
My car's totaled. It's all his fault and now, he has absolutely no money. There is no way that he can pay me. So the judge decrees that he becomes my butler.
I know. I can tell. It's one of my powers. Why, did you ever fake?
What happens if the husband dies after the wife, who brings in the clothing in then?
Say you go to the bathroom at two o'clock in the morning, what's the outfit? I mean, you dressing up or is it come as you are?
I gotta call her. Should I call her?
What did they put on this tuna? Tastes like a dill, I think it's a dill.
What if he's waiting for me outside? He pointed at me! Did you see him point?!
It's that bleak? (pours a glass of milk)
I tell you, when she threw that toupee out the window, it was the best thing that ever happened to me. I feel like my old self again. Totally inadequate, completely insecure, paranoid, neurotic, it's a pleasure.
The guy who pitched him the show with the stories about nothing. (snaps fingers) Jerry Seinfeld. Jerry Seinfeld's friend.
I can't carry any changes in these pants, it falls out.
You see? We were made for each other. (Thinking to himself) It's amazing. If I reach out and touch her breast right not, she'd scream and throw me out of the car. But at this time tomorrow, I could touch it all I want.
(getting up and leaving) Alright! That's it for me. Goodnight everybody.
Are you going to help me or not?
Well, you got no place to go. I'll tell you what your problem is You brought your queen out too fast. What do you think? She's one of these feminists looking to get out of the house? No, the queen is old fashioned. . Likes to stay home. Cook. Take care of her man. Make sure he feels good.
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. All right. I don't think we're gonna have any problem with that. (chuckles nervously) Good talking to you Tom. Really.
Yes. Yes. You know what's interesting. The quarterback for the Atlanta Falcons is Bobby Hebert. No "r" which I find fascinating. You know it's Herbert h-e-r-b-e-r-t, Hebert h-e-b-e-r-t. "Hebert" it's a fun name to pronounce. Try and say it Hebert. Take a shot. All right. (check arrives) All right. I
(Hands still out, even though they've stopped looking at them) What happened to him?
I went in with a pretty woman? You know, kinda short, big wall o' hair, face like a frying pan?
C'mon Jerry, let's go. What was that all about?
Now she thinks we're gay, not that there's anything wrong with it...
It was very traumatic. The last thing I remember is you flinching. Then, everything went black.
Well, it's . . . much too low.
I think it moved. Oh my god, I think it moved. Yeah, give me the big piece. I'll see you later.
Hey, hey. Kramer, what are you doing? You can't smoke in here.
I know what I'm doin'. In fact Mr. Wilhelm gave me one of those little stress dolls. All right. (gets up) Back to work. (acts annoyed and leaves)
(rising to his feet) Hey! Hey, you! (setting off after her) Come back here!! Don't gallop away!!
This is not a Metallica concert, it?s an opera alright, a little dignity, a little class, just give me my ticket, I will stand over here and sell it.
I'm not giving you the satisfaction. I'm gonna watch it again...
Well, I didn't really think about what I was gonna do with all..
I don't understand. They're supposed to be casting this week. Something's wrong. Maybe they're not doing it.
What did you do here? You took out the wrong guy.
Yeah, yeah. Just delivering some presents to my folks.
No, I would have picked up on it. I can always tell when a woman likes me, they always somehow let you know. With me, they could torture me, I wouldn't tell them. If anything I'd try to make them think I don't like them, then they think, "Oh, look at this guy, he's not even looking at me, he must have something going for him."
here Elaine here, Superman (hands a comic book to Elaine, who passes it to Tony) please, next time it will only be the two of us
I love that bathroom. It's got that high, high toilet. I feel like a gargoyle perched on the ledge of a building.
Know him? Would you, uh, like to meet him?
Can I uh, can I walk you back to work?
Thank you! Thank you very much. (Jerry and Melissa stop and look at George)
I can't get a massage from a man.
Listen to this. Marcy comes up and she tells me her ex-boyfriend was over late last night, and "yada yada yada, I'm really tired today." You don't think she yada yada'd sex.
Ok, everybody, uh...I have an announcement to make. From now on, I will be known as-
So? For a twenty-five dollar cleaning, I can listen to some pointless blather.
(frustrated) Ohh, I wanted to see that. (waves his arms in frustration) Thanks. Thanks a lot.
Okay. "Breakfast At Tiffany's." (Begins to read, but gradually his attention is drawn to the TV Guide on the end table. George realizes there's a show on he wants to see by looking at his watch, and doesn't start the book.)
Exactly, but theyre on there  waiting. She said she cant wait to see me, were having dinner tonight. Shes supposed to call me as soon as she gets home.
I'm going straight to hell, no two ways about it.
He's on the lamb(?), he's on the loose!
(Not amused with her answer) Eggs are eggs. That is very profound. (laughs; Daphne goes back to reading her paper) By the same token you could say fish is fish. Ha ha ha, I don't think so. (pauses) Listen Dophne
Well get it back! It's very important. (winks)
I don't know of this is the house. I don't see Jerry's car anywhere.
Well, sir, I - I gave out the fake card, because, um, I don't really celebrate Christmas. I, um, I celebrate Festivus.
If only something like that could happen to me.
Got her machine. Im dead, Im a dead man. Thats it. Im dead, Im a dead man. Dead man.
I want you to have this job. Of course...
Let me digest it. Let me get my money's worth. Y'know what would be good is if there was someone else in the bathroom that could tell me.
Oh yes, by no means, the mood. Let me know if there's anything I can do to lend support to the mood.
Well, you know, It's interesting, you know, under that pressure, what you're capable of.
Yeahaha, I gave it a shot (pats Jerry on the arm)... So, any word on the "artiste"? (puts a video in the VCR)
So what? What am I supposed to do?
(animated) Fixed up? A cup of coffee! A cup of coffee is not a fix up!
I'll tell ya, if I ever get out of here, I'm gonna change my life. I'm gonna do a whole Zen thing. Take up yoga, meditate.. I'll eat right. Calm down, lose my anger.. (Sees Jerry and Elaine aren't listening. He snaps) Hey, is anybody listening?!
I'll tell you what, if pig-man shows up, we'll squeeze him in. I'll see you later.
Elaine, shes a psychic. She knows how the kids going to be.
Hey, you gotta take a ride with me later. I borrowed my father's car. '68 GTO.
I really think I should have been consulted about this.
Let me ask you something. What do you think of this shirt?
(to the guy next to him) This guy stinks. (speaking of Michael)
Now if you will kindly help me unwedge my front wheel, I'll be on my way.
Sorry. I'll just go back to my usual routine.
(urgent) Move a pinkie, if it's yes. Can you move a pinkie?
And get a picture of him, with his shirt off.
Are you sure? Oh, look who I'm talking to. The president of NBC. (forced laughter)
Ok. Good. And Kramer, you're in charge of taping off the loading zone.
She put them in her pocketbook. I guess she took them with her.
Uh, it was dangling! There were only two left in the machine! He mustve bought one, and gotten both.
25 kids for his birthday party? (to kid under table) Don't put your tongue on the floor! He's putting his tongue on the floor! Here, here, have some more sugar packets. (tosses some Equal packets under the table)
Oh, yeah. You wish you had this coat.
(dismayed) I didn't even know you wanted to get serious!
How you gonna catch him? He's probably boarded the plane already.
When you sent me the-the bill for the dry-cleaning. I thought the show didn't have a chance.
I gotta go back to the library and talk to him. I gotta find out if I&Mac226;m the guy who ruined his life.
(through mouthful of food) So, Carrie, you and Susan are cousins. So your baby daughter is gonna be Susan's second cousin, right? So what does that make me?
You came to see me. I work in the building.
(Still focused on the nudist) They're naked, the gardeners naked.. the bellhops. (Jerry makes a noise of astonishment) One big nude-a-rama.
(from other room) Uh, tippy toe! Tippy toe! Lemon tree!
I just pray Kruger doesn't realize that it's gone until this guy can fix it up.
Well, you know, to be honest sir -- my, my new secretary Ade, came up with that one.
Well, sometimes you can't help these people 'til they hit rock bottom.
Take it easy. Take it easy. It's not the end of the world.
All right. I am happy, and I'll tell ya why -- because the two of you were making me and every one of your friends sick! Right, Elaine?
No, no, Kurt - wrong attitude. You should be happy now.
The only thing that bothers me is that I'm just coming up with this now.
I--I've been, walkin' around all night.. I've been thinkin' about Allison and me.. an' you--
Let's see, How I'm very good at going in reverse in my car, why isn't Postum a more popular drink,
See, this should be a show. This is the show.
Well I guess that's because I wear boxer shorts.
(Stopping him) Ah, excuse me. When your, uh, when your wallet was open, I - I glanced inside, and I couldnt help but notice that you have several crisp dollar bills.
Oh hey, by the way. Do you want a box 'a, Cuban cigars? I smoked one last night. I got nauseous.
(Motioning toward waitress) I think she likes me.
hey, you know what? I just remembered something. I had a dream about that guy last night. This is amazing.
It was a fat camp. Those kids depended on me.
Jerry? Yes, I suppose he is white. You know, I never really thought about it. I don't see people in terms of color. You know, there's someone I'd like you to meet. Hand on... (To phone) Is Mr. Morgan in?
I have to have my tonsils taken out.
Dont insult me, my friend. Remember who youre talking to. No ones a bigger idiot than me.
Yesterday, took the day off. (Picks up a red Power Ranger action figure from the model and pretends it's him.) Now, from the time I left the room...
How so? I'll tell you how so. She's bald!
Well, I didn't want to break our date.
Cause its signals, Jerry, its signals! (snapping his fingers) Dont you- all right. Did she even ask you, what you were doin tomorrow night, if you were busy?
Well, let's just say it wouldn't exist without me. (Notices another person in the library dressed the same as Celia.) So you two uh, shop at the same store, (hu)?
I-I'm sure if you weren't satisfied you would probably say something wouldn't you?
Well, I wish I could say the same, but I must say, with all due respect, I find it very hard to see the logic behind some of the moves you have made with this fine organization. In the past twenty years you have caused myself, and the city of New York, a good deal of distress, as we have watched you take our beloved Yankees and reduced them to a laughing stock, all for the glorification of your massive ego!
Alrighty, so. That's one tuck and one no-tuck. Got that?
Well, it's all for charity, so what's the difference.
(Still mad a Leslie) Never said goodbye. Goodbye!
Well I was just going to wander the streets. Don't wanna tag along with you or anything.
Oh! That's good judgment. That's a pile of judgment there. Sure.
Guys, hitting is not about muscle. It's simple physics. Calculate the velocity, v, in relation to the trajectory, t, in which g, gravity, of course remains a constant. (Hits a home run) It's not complicated.
Yeah! Yeah!..Staten Island . What about my clothes ,how do I get the rest of the clothes?
Really...(he honks the car and is startled, Elaine laughs)......I have to say...You were really good doing that porno thing....you're talented.
Alright, so that's one tuck and one no-tuck.
He had a TV show! He had cartoons!
"To the victor goes the spoils." What are you going to do tonight?
Well you see he slipped, and he landed on a kinda of a..
Are you kidding? People get spaces this good, they never give em up.
What a world that would be, if you just could ask a woman what shes thinkin.
You know Keith, what I've always wondered, with all these ball clubs flying around all season don't you think there would be a plane crash? ...
Well I think it would be nice if there was some kind of historical record of it.
Jerry, I'm trapped under my desk. Steinbrenner is in the room. You got to help[ me.
You said the guy gave you an open-lipped kiss!
I was just wondering what it was you wanted for dessert.
Ha Haaaaaaa... Jerry how do you like that.You see I get myself in a dizzy, I'm all worked up and for what?
So what do you care what she thinks.
You got bit by a strange dog and you didn't get a rabies shot?
Yeah.. yeah, we're - we're cool. (Knocks lightly. Kramer takes charge by knocking on the door louder. The busboy answers) Uh, I'm sorry to bother you, I was in the restaurant earlier and I was wondering if I could talk to you for a few minutes about what happened. (He gestures for them to come in. They obey) I hope I'm not interrupting anything. It's just that I think I may have - without realizing it - been responsible for getting you fired. (Nervously laughs) And.. and.. and I just want you to know that I didn't intend for that to happen.
No they don't. I tried that once. I snubbed for a year. Nothing. Every woman I saw, I snubbed. You never saw people so pleased. (Elaine returns from the bathroom.)
Well the sex was okay, but I threw up from the Hennigans.
No, she left. Listen, you can't mention any of this to Elaine. Cynthia will kill me, we made a deal.
But she's gonna know that I like her more than she likes me.
She doesn't like. Here is your blue one, it's her favorite. (Takes sweater out of his bag.)
I can't be blind, Jerry The blind are courageous.
Jerry? I have to tell you something. This is the dullest moment Ive ever experienced.
All names sound strange the first time you hear 'em. What, you telling me people loved the name Blanche the first time they heard it?
Wait a minute. (astonished) You're thinking of moving to Florida again?!
It's a spanish dish. It's a moulage of fish, an meat with rice. Very tasty.
I believe the doors on the bathroom stalls, here at the stadium, don't offer much by way of privacy. But I was thinking if we extend the doors all the way to the floors......
Yeah, I should do the opposite, I should.
(smiling) I'm on a winning ball club, Jerry. They probably wanna pick my brains.
(together -- with arms extended -- palms upwards) Stan The Caddy.
Right, can we go? Cause Im double-parked, Im gonna get a ticket.
Pull hair, Poke eyes, Groin stuff. Whatever I gotta do. (he opens a blue bottled beverage)
Yes, yes, but uh, I have to make a call, so...
Listen, I have a tremendous favor to ask.
You know what I never understood? Why did they change the siren noise? When I was a kid it was always "waaaa, waaaa", you know now it "woo-woo-woo-woo-woo". Why did they do that, did they do some research? Did they find that woo-woo was more effective than waa?
I should be in a place like this. I envy this woman. Ya' get to wear slippers all day. Friends visit. They pity you. Pity is very underrated. I like it it's good. Plus they give you those word association tests. I love those.
I'm telling you, skip the Drake's wedding, go to the game.
Hey, check this out. I gotta give out Christmas presents to everyone down at Kruger, so I'm pulling a Whatley. (Give a Christmas card to Jerry)
No, I don't have any change. I never carry change.
Oh...uh, because if it had anything at all to do with what you perceived as me leering at your daughter, I really have to take issue with that. I did not leer. (To Jerry) Did I leer?
Ho ho ho ho! I can't wait for Hanke to come crawling back to me.
Well anyway, the, uh... the stone is up, I paid my respects, guess that's it.
Yeah, look at me. Now I GOTTA FIGURE OUT THE HAT SIZES OF 59,000 DIFFERENT PEOPLE!! WHAT IF A PINHEAD SHOWS UP. I GOTTA BE ON TOP OF THAT.
I need some water. I gotta get some water.
yeah, Kramer, we're, uh, kind of in the middle of something here. We're trying to do a little work..
(laughs) Youd have to be a real loser to try something like that.
(thinking to himself) Oh my god, there she is. That's the face, just like the picture.
I'm the assistant to the travelling secretary. I'm going on the road trips with 'em! I'll be on the plane... I'm working in Yankee Stadium! This is a dream, I'm busting, Jerry, I'm busting!
Do you hold the neck together with one hand, or are you just letting it flap in the breeze?
(To the man behind him in line) Yeah, right Im gonna get my car repaired at a dealership. Huh! Why dont I just flush my money down the toilet?
I insist. Ill fix us a drink. (phone rings  who would that be?) I got it.
Awright, listen, can you uh, gimme a lift back to my place?
Oh, yeah, me too, me too. Boy oh boy oh boy...! You know, in fact, I've been thinking about it, and I feel like I'm stealing from you! Five-hundred dollars! It's gonna be worth thousands soon! You know what? On second thought, I can't even accept it.
You should have somebody take a look at that.
Yes, yes, she had a nose job. I loved her very deeply. Will she ever speak to me again?
Whatever. Listen, I'm very concerned about this guy.
(whistles disapprovingly) Ho ho ho, Had to? Had to come in?
I'm telling you, that cashier is riding horses on my money.
Sure, sure, sure, sure. (patting Jerry on the shoulders) How about these seats? Are these fantastic, huh? Huh? I feel like Lincoln.
Christie? That's the one you met in the antique store?
Apparently the glue in the wedding invitations was a....toxic.
This thing can't hurt me, can it? I mean, it is a laser. What if it hits my eye?
This was supposed to be 'The summer of George'! The summer of George.
He just read it. (Russell vomits again. Jerry and George look ashamed.)
All right, believe me, you're not going to marry him.
D'oh...Oh, oh, the judge! I hate this guy!
Okay, uh, eighteen dollars, and there it is. There you go. So maybe we could get together this weekend.
George! She said George? She remembered my name. (loudly -- to a passing waitress and the rest of the restaurant) Diane DeConn remembered my name. She was the "it" girl!
Yes, a shame. That is exactly how I would put it. Now Mrs. Sweedler, with all due discretion and sensitivity, and taking in the whole scope of the situation, I just can't help but think that, the hospital is somehow responsible for compensating the other, still living 'victim' of horrendous, horrendous tragedy.
(bored to death) Well, I-I just recently uh...
It's like a magic trick. Sometimes I think it would be easier to bend a spoon mentally than to make that transformation.
huh Kramer it's huh.. gonna be pretty dangerous up there
Wow! Heh. (Half kidding) You don't, huh, have a replacement lined up for me, do ya? heh he he he he he...
So what's the deal they don't want to have dinner with my parents?
You're right, how did I miss that? (Begins unlocking the door, mutters under his breath) Maybe because it's a crock of shit.
And, um, it was quite good. In fact, you even incorporated me into the show. I'm not actually a performer. Although, my parents felt I had talent..
I tell you what, you give me the twenty, and I will buy *you* a popcorn and soda, and I'll throw in a bon-bons.
My cousin worked for Bouchard's. They used to use the bouilla-base for a toilet. (Jerry and Russell are shocked.)
(Laughs) Relationship intern...hey, what if two of us teamed up?
Two tickets to "Guys And Dolls"! I'm gonna go with you!
What, are you, nuts? You're gonna spend more on the ticket than you're gonna get back from Grossbard.
I don't know, it sounds like pigeons or something!
Oh, right! (Shakes her hand) Right! Hey, hey.. I love the floors in here. It's like a gymnasium in here! Try and guard me! (Dribbles an imaginary ball
You know, about the uh, two of us getting together. And I know that I said I was engaged, but (laughs) uh, you know, it's really just something you say. It's like, going steady. You know uh, going steady, engaged, it's, it's all just stuff you say. (chuckles) Anyway, I was watching uh, My Cousin Vinnie, on the uh, on the tape the other day, and I was thinking that uh, you know, the two of us might take a meeting, as they say. (chuckles) So, what d'you, what d'you think?
I think I'd be good at that. I talk to people all the time. Someone even told me once they thought I'd be a good talk show host.
Woo! Some day out there - You ever see weather like that? Woo! It's crisp - it's crispy crisp.
Alright, fine.I'll drive the 3 hours each way, 6 hours all together, and take 'em off myself!!
And why shouldn't you? Be fresh Stay fresh
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's in the vault. I'm putting it in the vault.
That?s-that?s-Harry Fong, he's a very good friend of mine and he's a big opera buff. Enjoy the show there harry!... You know what.
There has got to be some way to get back into Pisano's.
Because. There was a lot of cake lying around the house. Just sitting there going with all the excess milk from all the experiments [grins]
Thats why, you know, a shake is bad.
(upset) Well, you've scared her off. We may never see mom again.
You know what this has to do with?
I said preferably cashmere, for warmth. So in front of the whole party, he says, 'No. I don't want you stretching out the neck hole.'
I gotta get to Fowler. I know that he would take this squirrel off my hands. It's practically bionic!
....But after that we really talked didn't we?
Nah, he didn't have anything to do with it...
Ripe. Boy, this Joe's got some terrific fruit.
Well, you know, it's really very funny, because you know what we got here, really? We really, really, just have a terrible misunderstanding. You see, when I passed on the deal, I thought that's what Jerry wanted me to say. Y'know, I, I misinterpreted.
The little extra moan you threw in there. Laying it on a bit thick, don't you think?
I have noticed she does tend to go to the bathroom right after we finish eating.
But I digress. Let me see, now. You were standing at one end of the line and I was right next to you. And I remember we were even for like, the first five yards and then , BOOM,...You were gone.
Oh, no, no. Twix is the only candy with the cookie crunch.
(incredulous) I look just like him. I. Me. (flings his arms out) This! This is what her boyfriend looks like. How is that possible?
There must be some way to find out.
Oh, well, don't worry about it -- he's got plenty of money. (spins his chair away from her)
(to Carrie) It's just that, I know her, and boy...
There's a bag of Pepperidge Farm cookies up there.
Oh, that's a dangerous fruit. It's like a weapon that thing, got spikes on the end. You can get killed from one of those things.
Well hello. Um, ah, specifically the reason that I'm here, uh, I don't know uh what Elaine told you but uh I broke up with my girlfriend a couple of weeks ago. Actually she broke up with me [struggling with his coat zipper] and uh, well, I was the cause of it and uh, I just wanted to find out from you ... What's with this thing?
Don't you see. She's looking at my pictures.
I have to talk to you about something .
I got it from the Institute. The Institute.
Well, what is that? That's a crime! Do you know how hot those things get? They should be wearing cotton.
All right, let me ask you something When do you start to worry about ear hair?
Theyre the ones who should be ashamed. They signed me to a one-year contract. As long as I show up for work every day, they have to pay me.
What the hell is this? George, Elaine and I went to see Chunnel ... with Jerry. With Jerry, huh? With Jerry! Great. Great! (dials phone) Probably went to the 84th St. That's where I always go with Jerry.
(Looking over the writing materials they just bought) Bics? What, d'ja get, bics?
So the plan is to secretly sterilise her mouth?
You want me to roll six thousand of these?! What, should I quit my job?!
"Well...there's no room for someone like that in this organization."
I did. I'm back. I love this relationship, I feel so liberated!
It's like puberty that never stops. Ear puberty, nose puberty, knuckle puberty, you gotta be vigilent. Let me ask you this Do you know where Walker Street is downtown? I've got a league meeting there.
Oh, Rita. Hey, Mr. Shermack, how're you doing, good to see you. Jay, always a pleasure. (To Susan) Sweetie. (Kisses her and then sits down next to Jerry) Yeah, yeah, that butler idea, that's beautiful. Isn't that killer? (Aside to Jerry) I thought I was getting the butler.
You know how easy it is for dead people to travel? Its not like getting on a bus. One second. (snaps his fingers) Its all mental.
Yeah. I don't think they'll be able to tell.
(Changing subject) Hey, I htink I may have found someone for the scholarship.
Oh of course you can use it, sure. (Jerry saying stuff through the phone) Ok, bye. (hangs the phone up)
You don't think I can keep a secret?
So I saw that new movie about the Hindenburg.
Well if she can't tell "six" from "sex" then how is she going to lip read from across the room?
This friend of Susan's is staying with us for two weeks...Now am I wrong or is that excessive?
Well, I shouldn't have to pay for it!
(laughs - hehe) Well, first, I'm brushing my teeth and this piece of apple-skin, that must have been lodged in there for days, comes loose.
Who's dressing you? (Laughs) You look like a complete idiot! You know, I wouldn't wipe my- (Unable to take anymore, Leslie gets up and shoves George violently. His hands go straight for the hot iron sitting on the dressing room table. George screams out in agony) AAHHHH!!!!! (his voice is heard outside the building, on the street, and in the park were a bunch of pigeons are scared by the yelling)
Oh, well, I'm sure you can reach her...she's a poet. What does a poet need an unlisted number for?
I guess I've been hanging on to them for so long cuz i couldn't accept the fact that Dad was really gone forever (hugs a piece of clothing)
This is like a Penthouse letter...Why can't I meet women like this?
Im going to find out whats going on. All right?
Let's test him. Hey, driver. What do you say we stop off, pick up your sister, have a little fun back here? No, he can't hear us.
Did I get him in trouble? Because of what I said?! I just told him what happened.. he didn't do it on purpose.. (Mangager and busboy are arguing. The busboy points in the direction of George) He pointed at me. Why did he point at me?!
Lesbian wedding. How do they work bride and groom out, what do they flip a coin?
Yeah! That's how they talk. You know, everyone's either a bastard or a son of a bitch. Yeah, it's like uh..."boy, that son of a bitch Box can really hit, uh?!" (laughs)
No sports jacket? I don't need a sports jacket? Writers wear sports jackets.
But I asked you before if you had a ticket, and you said no!
So she doesn't want to see me anymore.
Ah ha, well, I really wouldn't know about that. I don't watch much TV. I like to read. So what do you do, a lot of that "did you ever notice?" this kind of stuff.
(on phone, as Jerry gestures beside him) No, Lindsay, it was not IN the garbage. It was above the garbage. Hovering. Like an angel. Of course I know your aunt bit it. I kissed her goodbye. Listen, can I tell you something else? In my family, we used to eat out of the garbage all the time. (Jerry makes a face) It was no big thing. That's right. Oh, okay. Buh-bye. (hangs up phone) I'm back in, she gave me a second chance.
Hey believe me, baldness will catch on. When the aliens come, who do you think they're gonna relate to? Who do you think is going to be the first ones getting a tour of the ship?
we rode along all the way to the hospital
Wait a minute Jerry, there's a bigger issue here. If you go through that wall and become one of those guys I'll be left here on this side. Take me with you.
What's the matter with you? Are you crazy? Why are you using my name?!
The doctors thought he had cancer, but the surgery revealed he never actually had it.
Wait. Whoa! That's the Rabbi from Elaine's building. I just met this guy the other day.
You know, we're living in a society! We're supposed to act in a civilized way.
Do you? That makes me so happy. Elaine's proud of me Jerry.
Your boyfriend reads the Daily Worker? What is he? A communist?
(with a mouth full of food) This is good. Oh, this is good.
(he walks casually to Tom, and taps his arm) Listen. I know we've had our problems in the past, but we got a show to do tonight. Time to pull together as a team. Life's too short. I say, let's let bygones be bygones. If you took the raisins, if you didn't take the raisins-- They weren't even my raisins. I was just curious because it seems like a strange to do to walk into a room, audition, and to walk out with a box of raisins. Anyway, whatever. If you ever want to tell me about it, the door to my office is always opened. In the event that I get an office. You'll come in, we'll talk about the raisins. We'll have a nice laugh.
All right, I?ll tell you what, you seem like a nice guy, let?s stop jerking around. Give me.. two hundred and fifty dollars, I?ve got people waiting for me, I've got to get the hell out of here.
I'm not stealing it. They owe me ten dollars. They stole from me.
Pulp can move, Baby! Why didn't you eat a real breakfast?
Yeah, yeah, right here. (hands it to him)
I-I don't know. Last time I got the tap.
Honesty, hard-work, these are the values that I was raised on. The most important thing Joey, is to be able to look yourself in the mirror before you go to sleep at night.
No, I can't. She knows I go there. It's not secure. (the call waiting beeps) Hey, I got another call comin' in. I gotta let the machine get it. Bye. (hangs up)
Excuse me, sir, do you have the time?
Plans. Schemes. She ah, she keeps talking about getting back together with her old friends, you know - "the gang," as she likes to call them (chuckles), you know. Yeah, they're eh, they're hatching something, you can count on that.
Didja see the way she was looking at me?
No you wouldn't. Nobody would. It's just that... they were missing, and... well I'm just inquiring. (chuckles nervously)
Yeah. Hey, you know, I gotta go get these tomatoes. You wanna go for a ride?
I'm interviewing all these annoying little overachievers.. finally, this kid walks in - Steven Koren - a regular guy.. likes sports.. watches T.V..
I walked in, your lobby door is broken again.
The way they make 'em these days, I'll never have to tell her.
Time like what? I'm hungry. My stomach doesn't know that Kramer's wanted.
Grateful? How can you be grateful when you're *so* close to the end? When you know that any second-- Poof! Bamm-O! It can all be over. I mean you're not stupid, you can read the handwriting on the wall. It's a matter of simple arithmetic, for Gods sake...
So, if Susan and I had... I mean, if the envelopes hadn't, uh... then we--
(on tape, singing) "Believe it or not, George, isn't at home, please leave a mes-saaage at the beep. I must be out or I'd pick up the pho-one. Where could I be? Believe it or not, I'm not hooome." (beep)
This...is an organizer, a secretary, and a friend.
How come this sweater is only 85 dollars?
My place? NO, no, no. I hate my place. I don't wanna go back to my place.
Well, Dr, Allenwood, uh...I was hoping to compile an - admittedly, rudimentary - scrapbook of her life. Something that Betsy could have, and hold onto.
Yeah, yeah. Shes punctual... and uh shes been late, sometimes.
Specific, Ah, lets see. I've walked in and out of so many buildings they all .. blend in together, I uh, ..
I couldn't help it! Elaine moved the mirror, I got discombobulated.
Drink your soda! Come on! I know you're there, laughing at me. Laughing and lying and laughing! I had to go to Reggies, Jerry! Reggies!
Yes, it is consistent. I've, uh, I've tried to maintain a consistent feel throughout the house.
Now, I'm aware that my own physical dimensions are perhaps a little short of perfection.
Pretty chintzy, huh? Considering the money she makes.. She's a big executive for Federal Express.
Why do you have to be so suspicious of every one. This is a great man Zeng Zau, he wants to help bald people.
Why did he tell you and not me?
Jerry, figure this out. I'm in the coffee shop, and this beautiful girl I could never even talk to, mistakes me for her boyfriend.
Well you know, if you were sitting right next to her you'd have to console her no matter what.
Did I need that pointed out for me? What is that going to do for me? How does that help me, to see her? I'm trying to live my life. Don't show me that.
Let me ask you something. Could you tell if teeth marks on someone's arm matched teeth marks on a pencil?
(aggravated) Oh, that's not good enough! You don't try and de-sour. You have to sweeten too!
I don't know what Newman wanted to see me for.
Oy uy uy.. (Antonio points to the sink) We really should get going.
Alright, I gotta go. I'm heading over to Bonnie's.
I'm gay! I'm a gay man! I'm very, very gay.
Oh, okay. (Starts to walk other way and then walks to their room and goes in)
(excited) Ho ho! (gestures and steps towards bedroom but Loretta walks the other way to the couch)
Anything, everything, something, nothing - Who the hell cares? Put me down. I'm down!
She had to be impressed by that conversation, had to! It was a great performance. I am unbelievable on the phone. On the date they should just have two phones on the table at the restaurant, done.
Well how do you even know its hers? Maybe it belonged to Carol. Did you see a name on the tube?
Oh, well, so what? Laughter - what is that? I mean, what is the point of opening your mouth and going "Ha, ha!"? What is that? "Ha, ha!"?
Well, it's kind of a mystery, isn't it?
(takes a large bite - with his mouth still full, his speech is muffled) Oh, this is fabulous.
Uh, let me ask you something. You uh, you ever hear of Marisa Tomei?
Yes, I will do the opposite. I used to sit here and do nothing, and regret it for the rest of the day, so now I will do the opposite, and I will do something!
So who am I to be thinking about someone's nose? I mean, I should be grateful someone like her even looks at me. I have no job, nothing. But I have to say, I think about the nose. I don't want to think about the nose. I don't ask to think about the nose, but I think about it. I go to bed at night, I tell myself, 'Don't think about the nose, forget the nose,' but I think about it. I look at her, I see nose.
I mean, big would even be ok, a little beyond big.
(Thomassoulo helps George get up) Yeah, what the hell.
Look at this sparkle. (looks up, sees Lindsay's mother) Mrs. Enright! (runs after her) Mrs. Enright! Mrs. Enright!
Oh, no no no, I haven't even seen her apartment yet. Tomorrow night's the first night.
(Angry) Yeah, that's what they told me the last time.
Well, whoever he was, he knew a lot about The A-Team!
Ooooo, I'm scared. . . . Ohoooo they're not going to do the show.
Jerry, I felt like a straight man in some horrible sketch. He was riffing! Riffing! On my pain!
You've got 'shiksappeal'. Jewish men love the idea of meeting a woman that's not like their mother.
I'll tell you what that is - that's a violation of club rules. Now I got him! And you're my witness!
Oh my God, an affair. That's so adult. It's like with stockings and martinis, and William Holden. On the other hand it probably wouldn't cost me any money.
And so, for all these reasons, we are officially broken up. (shuts book and reaches for door) Thank you, (opens door) and good night.
You know this whole thing never would have happened if you hadn't bailed out on me at the restaurant.
Hey, hey hey. Don't worry about me. I'm not a waffler. I don't waffle!
You know what? I changed my mind. I, uh, I don't think so.
'Why don't I rent the movie.' See, this is when I like you. Alright, now I'm relieved. (Kramer enters and comes over to the booth.)
Yeah, you know, what'd she uh, look like?
Take care. Take it easy. (Tom leaves with the casting director)
Jerry, can I talk to you for a second? (They enter Jerry's apartment)
"Ah! your just mad 'cause we beat ya."
I won't be able to, concentrate in front of you.
Nobody drives like me. Nobody. I'm doing things in this car, you have no idea they're going on. Wanna see me make a right turn from the left lane? Watch this.
What kind of plastic do you think it is? What do you think like that dry cleaning plastic?
Wait a minute, that is my apartment. I earned it with 34 years of misery!
All right, that's enough. I gotta go home and take a nap.
(Desperate to get rid of the book) Alright, I, I'll just take fifty. Do - do we have a deal?
(Thinking to himself) She's not concerned about the security guard. What kind of a person is this? I'm marrying a person who doesn't care that this man has to stand here 8 hours a day when he could easily be sitting.
(adamant) Yes I am. I defy you to come up with a better name than Seven.
(In a really strange way) Good, good, do that.
Hey, Lloyd. (Shakes hands with Lloyd) How's it going? (chuckles)
So what do you want me to do?
You haven't won. You may think you've won, but you haven't won. Do you know why? It's not over. This is not over. I'm not forgetting what's happening here. You have my ten dollars. I will get it back. Alright, don't worry. It's not over. I'm going now. Good bye. I will be back.
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I used to come here all the time with my fiance, back when it was a meat-packing plant. Ha. Here's her picture. (hands her a magazine page)
I got up, I was supposed to go to work, I came here instead.
(Muttering out, not really wanting to talk about his family) When the Costanzas came here, one brother stayed behind.
We'll just take a check. (She leaves the check. George, in all his cheapness, can't help but to review the check. He finds an error) You made a mistake on the..
Which market, the, eh, big one, the big market, the big board. Bull market, bear market, you name the market, I'm there.
I don't know if you're ready for it.
Oh, no no no, I'm fine. Let me help you with these dishes, huh?
Ah! Health's not good enough. I want more than health. Health's not doing it for me anymore. I'm sick of health.
But you are Blanche... You *are* in the shackles. Oh, I can't wait to read my *Time* magazine! Laaaast copy, too. Maybe I'll read it tomorrow-- in the park! It's supposed to be a beeyootiful day! Have a nice life... sentence, that is!
I was going to, but then I found out that the auto club has this free locksmith service, so I signed up. Just waiting for the membership to kick in.
I'm trying to get out of this Big Brother program. So when you get to Paris (handing Morty the postcards) all you have to do is drop 'em in any mailbox.
Ladies and gentlemen, this (Opens the door, Steven is standing there) is Steven Koren. His G.P.A. is a solid 2.0! Right in that meaty part of the curve - not showing off, not falling behind.
Well, I do what I can. (Robin comes over.)
(Defensively) You can look at them, but do NOT touch them. (Holds them out)
What are you looking at me like that for?
So... here I am. Ready to take you to the Hamptons.
rush? you want a rush? drop a ball on your toe my friend, talk about a rush, you'll be throbbing, you'll see visions
This is a *great* idea! Here... use this one. I get frequent flyer miles with every purchase... Wait! Get two tickets. As long as your turning it in for a refund what's the difference? I'll get *double* the bonus miles.
Who goes to the Super Bowl with their mailman?!
Gone. (Moves over to a chair in the living room. Kramer takes the carton of food to the table, and begins eating) The tenant association made me give it to this guy because he was an Andrea Doria survivor..
No. He was fine with it. Check that out.
You can't do that, you can't just sneak in from the back like that.
Sure. I could go the tomato route. But eh, I've given this a lot of thought Jerry. All that frustration. Ill never get any work done. So Im doing a complete 360. Im going for total efficiency and ability.
I'd like to be able to get it out.
I suppose if I had suggested Liam Neeson Day, you'd all be patting me on the back.
Besides, what's it gonna cost me? Thirty-eight bucks?
Yeah, yeah. Well, I guess I started losing it when I was about twenty-eight right around the time I made my first million. You know what they say. The first million is the hardest one.
This is a crude mock-up of the conference room. 1/14th scale.
There was no meeting. (gets one of the folding chairs) But it was quite a meeting. You are looking at the next director of Mets scouting. The only thing is, I have to get fired from the Yankees first.
I can't believe you're really going out with a woman named Lois.
This good be so sweet, Jerry. Saving lives? She's one step away working at the clinique counter!
Come on, hurry up, old man! I'm an animal!
What could I do? Did you see the mug on that kid?
...you'll see, things will be different now - if you just give me one more chance.
Well, what's so great about a Mom and Pop store? Let me tell you something. If my Mom and Pop ran a store, I wouldn't shop there.
This is it! It happened to me, Jerry! I was sitting in the restaurant, the two nut jobs were talking - I couldn't take it any more. I got up, and (Makes a noise) I bop into this woman..
The uniforms! Did you see how they played? Listen to these comments! (reads from the paper) "Wade Boggs 'What a fabric! Finally we can breathe.' Luis Palonia 'Cotton is king.' Paul O'Neill 'I never dreamed anything could be so soft and fluffy.' "
I said 'God bless you'. Was that so wrong?
U-ok. (George closes the window and shoos Elaine off. He opens the door to Monica.) Here you go.
So, she fell, and then she started screaming, "My back! My back!" So, I picked her up and took her to the hospital.
All right, all right. KNOCK IT OFF. Come on, let's go.
If I didnt put that floss in my pocket, Id be crawling around her bedroom right now looking for my glasses.
Because the underwear is pulled up from the back and ... it wedges in..
Hey. I got Jon Voight's LeBaron. (Jingles the keys.)
Hey, maybe this cheating thing is what I could use to ditch Maura.
Well, how good a look did you get?
Right. So I call her up, I tell her its me, she gives me an enthusiastic Hi!
I mean, uh... I had fun ice skating.
I'm cold too. At least you've got a coat. Let's get in the car.
Oh, it's gotta be fifty! Hee hee! You know how much Ted Danson makes, huh?
Um, hi, its George, George Costanza, remember me? The guy that didnt come up for coffee. You see, I didnt realise that coffee didnt really mean... well, whatever. Anyway, it was fun. It was... it was fun, so... oh boy, um, so... You call me back. If you want. Its up to you, you know, whatever you wanna do. Either way. The balls in your court. So uh, take it easy.
(clears throat) Maura, I, uh- I want you to know... I-I've given this a lot of thought. I'm sorry, but... we, uh, we have to break up.
I'm not through here, Jerry. (Picks up the model of the conference room.) I'm gonna keep on investigating. This thing is like an onion. The more layers you peel, the more it stinks. (Pam enters, George leaves.)
He's actually doing him a favor. It's less money for him to buy food.
Man, would I like to see the look on his face.
I dont know. I cant believe theyre making me take this test.
They're all the same. You go, you sit, you eat popcorn, you watch. I'm sick of it.
(Scoffs) No, I told you, I'm not gonna do that.
I'm the opposite of every guy you've ever met.
Yeah, good luck. Hey I'll meet you outside.
She says she has to come to New York on business...
I did it. Hunh, we're going out as soon as she gets off of work and it'll still be daytime. You know I, Im much better in the daytime then I am at night. it's less pressure.
What do you think I mean bald? Bald. Bald bald.
We are going to the Knick game! Michael Jordan!
This hat just bottles in the heat, I -I don't even need a coat! It's unbelievable!
What about a rec room? Huh? Or a community center.
Why can't I have a heart attack? I'm allowed.
Youre not getting no Drakes Coffee Cake for fifty cents. Yae, Hey, Im all set. I got the ticket. Im going to the Cayman Islands this Friday.
Shhh What is wrong with you? You never tell 'em you like the car. (Advising) You're not sure what you want. You don't even know why you're here.
(from bathroom) How was Eric Roberts as the husband?
I told ya. Hey, any of you guys want to come out and help me fix my father's screen door in Queens?
Oh! Nuts! Excellent! You know what I love? How there's two nuts named after people. Hazel...and filbert.
(Sincerely) Thank you.. I, uh.. that might not work out.
She probably never heard it. Don't you see what this means? It's like the whole thing never happened. It's like when Superman reversed the rotation of the earth to save Lois Lane!
Well, I've to every Brentano's. This thing's flagged in every database in town!
This is what they would do in the movies! It's a beautiful thing! It's like a movie! I'm gonna slip him a mickey!
I can't believe you're hoarding sex moves. I'm out there rubbing two sticks together. You walk around with a zippo.
Why do I get pesto? Why do I think I'll like it? I keep trying to like it, like I have to like it.
No, no. Deena, it's not what you think.
George Costanza. Susan's, uh, friend? Long time no speak.
Yeah my parents have it. Sometimes it skips a generation.
What do you mean you will? That's a bad idea. Jerry is a very private person.
I just want the both of you to know how much you mean to me, and I love you both very, very much.
And ah, Ill have the bacon club without the turkey. (raises eyebrows)
Doing quite well, thank you. Yesterday I had a soft boiled egg and a quickie. You know what? If I could add TV to the equation, that would really be the ultimate.
This catalog is all about how to score in a foreign country.
Yeah, but nothing happens on the show. You see, it's just like life. You know, you eat, you go shopping, you read.. You eat, you read, You go shopping.
Eh, there's that woman that never talks to anybody.
She calls you today and she doesnt make a plan for tomorrow? What is that? Its Saturday night!
Huh-Hi. (looks around a little) Uhm, is Neil here?
I kept looking at her face. Id go, Cmon, love her. Love her!
Come on. Ya wanna go get some lunch?
Yes, I like to just be able to take the blankets and swish them and swirl them, you know what I mean? You know, I don't like being all tucked in. I like to have a lot of room, you know I like to have my toes pointed up in the air. Just like to scrunch up the blankets.
You're very good. Very good with the moanings and the gyrations. Y-You really had me going there for a minute.
You met her at the supermarket? How did you do that?
Unless she goes for the bathroom. Thats my only chance. (George crumbles. He drops the cassette on the table.) Who am I kidding? I cant do this, I cant do this. I dont even know how to work those stupid machines.
You couldn't figure out the World's Theory for yourself? It's just common sense. Anybody knows, ya gotta keep your worlds apart. (gesturing with hands going outward)
She said "sweep together" you idiots, not "sleep together."
Elaine and her sponges...she's got like, a war chest full of them.
...but is there any way that I could possibly have Neil's phone number?
Oh no, you're not going out on a high note with me Mr. Kruger!
Alright, alright, fine. (Gives the keys to Elaine.)
I'm a college graduate. You want me to be a mailman?
I couldn't have breakfast, it was lunchtime! The three hour time difference threw me. I wanted a tuna fish sandwich, they wouldn't serve me tuna fish sandwich, because they were only serving breakfast.
Hate those couples. I could never bee one of those couples. There are no bald woman around. You know?
(Like a kid) Because I don't want to.
Well we were all eating the raisins. And I remember you--you were eating some of the raisins. And then you left, and the raisins were gone. And I was just wondering if, you know (chuckles), maybe you took them with you.
Isn't that why we have locks on the doors?
I have to talk to Elaine. This cleaing lady is turning the screws on me. She's pushing for this whole relationship thing. She keeps calling me, threatening to go to the boss with this thing, I could lose my job, I gotta do something to keep her quiet.
(distracted) Mm? (acknowledges Katy) Oh, hi. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. We met uh, skiing that time. You're uh, married to the eye guy.
I heard they found a family in your freezer
Yeah, tell im. But quickly, Im double parked here.
And then assuming the strike is resolved, on April 14th, we, ah, play the Angels. So lets clear a floor at the Anaheim Hotel.
(crafty) Not necessarily. Why don't you take back the couch you gave me?
What about the body, what kind of body?
Well, it's the damnedest thing. The cat dies. So she comes back into town, she finds the cat lying on the carpet stiff as a board.
Oh leave Jack alone. Jack's got enough problems. I'll just take the small office.
Wow. (he runs his fingers through his hair, and then brushes the resulting fallout off his jacket)
Oh I got it. (TO JERRY) That I'm supposed to remember. Where the car is, that's insignificant.
I am not putting it in a garage, it's my space.
I can't believe I get paid for this.
You know, my mother used to walk around on our apartment just in her bra and panties. She didn't look anything like you, she was really disgusting, really bad body. If you could imagine uglier and fatter version of Shirley Booth. Remember Shirley Booth from Hazel. Really embarrassing, cause you know I had only mother in the whole neighborhood who was worse looking than Hazel. Imagine the taunts I would hear.
Whew! Anybody see that poster in there? That is weird, wild stuff, huh? Whew!
Any more grape juice? (Gets up and goes to the kitchen. Remy moves to the end of the couch where George was sitting.)
Just because you have someone's spare keys, it doesn't entitle you to break into their apartment. That's the reason you took away Kramer's keys.
She treated me to the Arabian mocha java.
Well how could you just play your message in front of anybody?
(shouting) Turn your key, Maura. Turn your key!
Jerry please, that's very nice, but, uh, (closes the door) where would we be going?
Yeah! She made me promise not to tell you .It's supposed to be a joke.
Oh... do I have to write him a note or something?
You want my friend to ask his uncle, a man who just lost his wife of 44 years, for a death certificate so that he can save a few bucks on a flight?
Jerry, it's me, George, don't worry, I'll return it tomorrow, no problem.
She just dislikes me so much... It's irresistable.
(Hands Antonio a card) Here's my card. I'm in real estate, so, if you're ever looking for something bigger, something nicer.. (Antonio is staring at him, angered) ..maybe not right now. Anyway.. (Extends his hand for a handshake. Antonio doesn't move)
I know less about women than anyone in the world. But one thing I do know is they're not happy if you don't spend the night. It could be a hot, sweaty room with no air conditioning and all they have is a little army cot this wide (Displays with French fry) You're not going anywhere.
Look...humm..I'm on with Beijing with the hair restauration clinic. Could you talk to them for me and tell them I'd like to place an order.
It's like I'm Neil Armstrong. I turn around for a sip of Tang and you jump out first.
Well, you really did it to me this time, Seinfeld. . . . What the hell happened here?
I'll tell you what, why don't you read this book and let's just see if you can explain it to me.
Lemme see this. (Tries to grab the papers.)
Kramer! You can't go! Who's gonna do the feats of strength?
Right. He cooks my food, he cleans my house, he does all my shopping for me. And there you go, that's your program.
Jerry, this whole Ellen situation.. has gone far enough.
Excuse me, are you going to be much longer? I have to make a very important call.
Ha ha. Everything's timed out to perfection, Jerry. Slippery Pete's got the Frogger running on battery power, the truck will be there any minute, and Kramer's taped out the loading zone.
Sir, I just got a call from the terrorist. I told him to call back here.
(On his way out) Heh, heh, heh. Thats what they want you to think.
(singing) Oh hey, if you happen to see the most beautiful girl who walked out on me. Tell her I'm sorry. Tell her I need my baby ... oh won't you tell her ... I love her. Oh hey, ...
Hey pop, would you buzz off, I've got something cooking.
All right, do you mind? I have the window! (To Willie) Now, what are you gonna do about my Twix?
Well, I've given this a lot of thought, and I've gotta say...
Listen, sweetheart, let me tell you a little something about guts. (Points to his head.) This is guts.
Ah, no, no. Are you sure? A girlfriend?
(jokingly) Well, so, legally, I could marry your daughter.
Oh, you know, Lloyd, I really don't have it.
We could build a cabin like (Snaps) that.
You think you could hook me up with these guys?
Her back went out. She's gotta be there for a couple of days. All she said on the way over in the car was, "Why, George, why?!".. I said, "Because it's there!"
Jerry it's funny, Paula and I actually met because of Elaine.
Jerry ... Where are you? I know you like to sit back here. Elaine! Susan!
Kramer, what the hell are you talking about?
Pretentious? Who, who isn't pretentious? Ha, ha, if everyone who was pretentious was in a mental institution, ... uh, obviously THIS isn't a mental institution.
And maybe we could go out and do something.
Yeah, yeah, me to miss -- I miss.
Probably. They all do. In my high school, half my graduating class had them. Of course, I'm from Long Island, so...
Why even try anymore? There's no sense to it. I'm never gonna meet anybody, I should just accept it.
That woman was unequivocally the worst date of my life.
(Elaine walking down the hall they notice her and wave her into the room) Elaine! Get! (She enters)
(melancholy) I wish that was all needed. Life can be so confusing. I..I'm searching for answers, anywhere.
By the way, have you spoken to Elaine yet today?
But Mr. Cantwell, you... you owe me for the soup...
Puke! That's a funny word. Puke. (laughing) Puke! Don't have to think about that.
So what could I do? I couldn't go through with it. She threatened to kill herself.
They're for protection, Jerry. Can you tell where I'm lookin'?
Cancer? Is it cancer? Do I have cancer?
Look I need you to do me a favor. I need you to get me lunch at Pisano's.
I'm not going to see that nut doctor she went to Europe with.
(confessing) Well, actually, I thought it up on the way over here.
He's getting on a bus, damn! (To the blind man) Those are nice glasses.
For 50 bucks? I'd put my face in the soup and blow.
Well... (shuts door) heeere we are (puts down his coat and chuckles)
Ye - yeah. And we had a pact, you know.
Uh, Jerry, you want your blankets tucked in?
I'll tell you what's wrong, a grown woman with a male roommate! It's unnatural, it's an abomination!
It's all worked out. Nina and I will have dinner Thursday at the restaurant where Babs works.
All right, Puddy, listen, and listen good I need to know the name of that mechanic that walks around here. Big guy, a liar. Short name. Sam? Moe? Sol?!
What are you, Bud Abbott? What are you callin me an idiot?
You are aware that Pensky is interested in me.
Ah, this is the kind of day that almost makes you feel good to be alive.
I don't like it, it's red. It it's too flashy.
Well if you and I ever got into, like a really serious fight you know, and the punches started flying -- who do you think would win?
All right Mrs. S. I and my good pal Keith Hernandez will be right back.
What do you need her for? There's a million lawyers.
Well, it's not my fault. You poked me!
Give me two bucks. Ill do it for two bucks.
Yes a cruise, a long cruise, just the two of you.
What are you up to now, uh, Step Nine?
She made a big breakfast every Sunday. I don't know what she put in those eggs.
Oh, what are you, like, a Quaker now?
Oh, please. (to the teller) Can you change this into bills?
Oh uuh, sure, why not. (the blind man hangs on to George's arm) Hey, that's the guy.
Id like to have a kid. Of course, you have to have a date first... Remember my friend, Adam, from Detroit?
Robin, listen to me. The most amazing thing has happened. Kramer has opened my eyes. I think I've changed.
(to himself) Yeah, you said it. (to Wilhelm) Uh, excuse me, Mr Wilhelm. Uh, do you really think... Well, is this downtown trip really necessary, you know, for the project?
What, is that the one your parents gave you?
Yeah, and you were engaged for like a minute, I was engaged for a year.
My mother loves Hampton tomatoes. She's nuts for Hampton tomatoes.
I don't understand lunch, I don't know anything about lunch. Listen. Just because I got the guy fired doesn't mean I turned him into a bum - does it?
I thought I saw him look in the mirror suspiciously.
[to himself] Hey, whatd'ya know? Look at that! A *lesbian* sighting. Oh-ho! My lucky day. They're *so* fascinating. Why is that? Because they don't want us. You gotta respect that...
You know what? I should really go talk to her. Nothing confrontational. Just two adults sitting down trying to clear the air. You know, I just know if I could spend some time alone with her. I've got to. (he grabs his jacket) I've got to.
They're reorganizing the staff, and I'm on thin ice with this guy as it is.
Hey, hey, let's not get so defensive here. This is a give and take process.
You're a very handsome man, by the way.
(picking up what Frank saw as a mouse) It's the remote.
Hey, what's another million, give or take. I get off where and when I wanna get off.
The guy slept with Marilyn Monroe, he's in Dinky Donuts. What about this doctor's note? Let's go see your friend Roy.
It was on a magazine! And it still had the doily on.
You know, you go out, you get another rye. Of course, it would have to be the same one from Schnitzer's. You put it in the kitchen somewhere and you say Ohh! There it is.
Oh, no no no. Course not. I got a great name for our kids. A real original. You wanna hear what it is? Huh, you ready?
(walking towards the door) I couldn't leave well enough alone?!
I like Christian rock. It's very positive. It's not like those real musicians who think they're so cool and hip.
Celia broke out of prison. I'm sitting in my home, she shows up at the door!
Alright, then. We've gotten to the bottom of that.
Wait a second, wait a second...and then the butler says, "I'm not cleanin' it up! I'm sick of cleaning!"
Imagine if I had to see them both on the same day? (mirthless) Haha! It's like runnin' a double marathon!
Why would I spend seven dollars to see a movie that I could watch on TV?
I do too. you see that's what we're about . You don't remind me of anyone and we love gum.
I get the feeling when lesbians are looking at me, they're thinking "That's why I'm not heterosexual".
You go in the living room. I'll take the test in here.
And she loved me. Hoo, ho, she really did.
See, didn't bother Susan either. That's why I'm different. I can sense the slightest human suffering.
Well, that's not offensive. (Reflects) It's abnormal, but it's not offensive.
Give me your key, I gotta get it.
Donna. Oh, youre the one that likes that commercial!
Well, you're gonna have to go to the bathroom!
Come on. We got all day tomorrow to come up with a story.
(really animated) Alright, alright. You see? This is why I hate writing with a large group. Everybody has their own little opinions, and it all gets homogenised, and you lose the whole edge of it. I'm going with jerk store! Jerk store is the line! Jerk store! Yess!
(adamant) Ah, c'mon! I'm telling you, I can coach for the NFL. It's not that hard
Well...maybe not as much as this bastard... (points at Zeke, they all laugh) I can hold my own! (they all continue laughing and drinking)
(quiet, desperate) Maybe she can get me another picture of man-hands. (calling) Elaine!
I'm sorry - I have to say, I'm a little disappointed, I thought it would be a lot nicer.
Y'know if the guy dies, the art could really be worth something...
So, uh, how long has this been going on?
I meet this women, Sheila. She works down at the one hour photo pace. She's got this incredible smile. Like she's got extra teeth or something
Yeah. There's something wrong with that? I'm a character. People are always saying to me, "You know you're a quite a character."
I am. Im a nice guy. And she seduced me! We were in my apartment, Im sitting on the couch, shes on the chair. I get up to go to the bathroom, I come back, shes on the couch. What am I supposed to do? Not do anything? I couldnt do that. I wouldve insulted her.
Yes, hello. Party's over. (taking off the suit)
Hey, so, did you give that radio the old switcheroo?
Why did you even take it? You broke up with her!
(yelling) Awright, let's just stay calm here! Don't get all crazy on me!
(resentfully dampened) It's not a prom. It's a Ball.
Susan Davis? (Getting possessive) Hey, wait a second..
Don't you see what it says here? Don't you understand what that's implying?
Oh, yeah? Holistic.. that's what I need. That's the answer.
Excuse me sir. Would you mind watching my bag for a minute?
Today. Im going today. Just dont do anything until you hear from me.
It - it's just that I'm here with my parents, and my mother wants me to take a civil service test - and to tell you the truth, I don't even think I'd pass it.. So..
No, no. That's just the thing. Anna told me that Elaine said I was one of the worst seeds she'd ever seen.
Oh that's OK, really, don't worry about it.
(after Wendy and to the receptionist) Oh, you have a policy! (to the world at large) The delicate genius has a policy! George heads for the door.
Oh! Modelling! What's that like? Fun? Ha ha. (to self in head) Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!
Hey, I just found twenty dollars! I tell you this, something is happening in my life. I did this opposite thing last night. Up was down, black was white, good was -
Id like a doggie bag for this please. (hands her plate to the waitress)
Now, listen closely. I was at the unemployment office and I told them that I was very close to getting a job with Vandelay Industries and I gave them your phone number. So, when now when the phone rings you've got to answer "Vandelay Industries".
Come on, how hard is that? Look at all the junk that's on TV. You want an idea? Here's an idea. You coach gymnastics team in high school. And you're married. And your son's not interested in gymnastics and you're pushing him into gymnastics.
Get up, get up, its her! Oh, the hell with this, Im scared to death, just walk away, its off, cancel everything, go!
Its Martine. I think hes dying. He tried to kill himself with pills.
(Impersonating Carson) I didn't not know that. Weird. Wild. (Susan and George both laugh)
Every night at six-thirty. The nurse was gorgeous.. then I got a look at the patient.. (Laughs, then snorts) I was going nuts.
(holding his cane) I gotta hobble. (walks out)
This is a fantastic place! I always thought it was a meat packing plant!
You want to be with somebody that doesn't like you.
Yeah. Thanks. Hey, listen, if you ever get a date, maybe the four of us could go out together sometime.
Are you crazy?! What are you doing?! You'll get us killed!
Boy that-that bank clock is-is eight minutes off.
All right. I will see you boys later.
I don't know what the reason could be.
What about the dolphins? You could swim with the dolphins down there.
What, you think I eat all my meals with you? (To waitress) Excuse me, sweetheart? I think you may have overcharged us. What is this?
Howbout Kramer or Elaine, they don't want them?
Yeah, yeah, the flower guy. Listen, I know this all sounds a little crazy, but...
(looks back to the group) I can read lips. You said let's sleep together.
(worried) Alright, alright. Look, we're people, you and me, huh? Businessmen. Colleagues, if I may. Let's not quibble. We'll do it for the thirteen thousand. Thirteen thousand, and I never came up here, we never talked, alright. You take good care. (moving past Russell toward the door) It was nice seeing you again, and nice meeting you. (to Cynthia) Cynthia, right?
Yes, well, if the other people in the office saw that I called an exterminator, they would just panic. Besides, this is sort of a friendly visit. Carl, right?
Oh Shut up! What are you doing back so soon, anyway? (puts the tape back in it's case.)
(to Carrie) You know, you're really being very selfish. It would be nice if you would think of someone other than yourself every now and then!
Well, Danielle, (digs in his pocket) we should get going. I got a key made for you.
Listen I was talking to Elaine today and she said she'd would really like to be an usher at the wedding
I was handcuffed to the bed.. In my underwear, (Sighs) where I remained.. (Scene cuts to another story) She was attractive.. She was, also, infact, a Nazi.. (Cuts to another story) The water.. that I had been swiming in was.. very cold. And, when I dropped the towel, there was.. significant shrinkage.. (Scene cuts to, yet, another story) Her parents were looking at me.. So, there I was, with a marble rye hanging from the end of a fishing pole.. (Scene cuts to his closing statements) In closing, these stories have not been embellished, because - they need no embellishment. They are simply, horrifyingly, the story of my life as a short, stocky, slow witted bald man. (Gets up) Thank you. (Every memeber of the board shows some sign that George's story is most deserving of the apartment. Ricardi is crying. George turns to leave, then remembers one more thing..) Oh, also.. my fiance died from licking toxic envelopes that I picked out. (Sobs and loud crying erupts from the board members) Thanks again. (Leaves. Eldridge looks defeated)
There was a box of raisins on the coffee table. Did you, by any chance, take them with you when left?
Well, she didn't BUY the big salad. I bought the big salad.
Were having lunch with a friend. He works in the building.
What, you didn't ask him about the car?
Yeah, yeah, and we started talking, and she's this lawyer who's incredible! Everything I said was funny! You know, she laughed at everything I said, she thinks I'm hilarious. You know in a way, it was almost too good. I started so good, I can't go any place but down now, ya know? I got no place to go.
I can't. He's been on my case about not paying attention. Besides, it's too late, I already told him I heard him.
Makes the 11 gauge look like a cap pistol.
(pulling out some money) Uh, yeah. Hang on. Just... yeah.
Hey, I'm his nephew, all right? Don't worry about it. Go ahead. Check it out.
But really, it's enough with the bar already.
Shhhhh. If you want to get in, theres very little time. (calling to the waitress) Sweetheart.. (Waitress approaches and tears off a check. George stops her.) No, no, no. That ought to cover it. (He hands her some money; she turns to leave; George stops her.) Just a second. Just a... let me jus-peek... (He looks at the check, then takes some money out of her hand. George urges Jerry and Elaine to eat.) Come on, come on, come on...
Yes! Because it is the mature, adult thing to do.
(standing up, still acting) Uhh! I'm caught in my own web of lies! (holds his hands up in surrender)
I gotta find a way to work this out, I love that apartment. It's so cozy, I'm ensconced in velvet. You know, if it were socially acceptable--
Do you really think I'm wrong about this Wyck guy?
Eat me alive, huh? We'll see who can make it in *this* town.
No, not a racial thing, there really is a resemblance...
No, she's taking this course in education for her masters. It's part of her research project, so I have to be a guinea pig.
Deeply in love. If you can't say anything bad about a relationship, you shouldn't say anything at all.
So in order to use these, I gotta spend like fifteen-hundred bucks. This is a bill for fifteen-hundred dollars. Plus, she'd ask about the sleeping arrangements, that whole sleeping arrangement conversation is depressing.
Yes, I agree. I hope my parents go long before I do.
(jokingly) You are still paying for this lunch?
You heard the man. I guess you gotta be moving your car.
Well, it's a good looking piece of meat. (laughs nervously) Wow, this is some place. A duplex, huh? (indicating) Look at this, you got stairs in an apartment. All my life, I dreamed about having steps in an apartment. Even one step. Sunken living room. Although, one step is really not all that sunken. (tries hard to elicit a laugh)
Yes, In fact, her mother is in the hospital right now. It's some kind of a Diverticulitis. (he continues walking slowly towards Steinbrenners desk)
You know, I can't talk to you anymore.
Oh my god, maybe Gwen saw it. Maybe that's what did it.
They're men with jobs, Jerry! They wear suits and ties. They're married, they have secretaries.
Hello, it's Natalie? Yeah, this is a business office but I'm not a business man per se. I'm here working for the people. Yes, I'm causing dissent. Stirring the pot. Getting people to question the whole rotten system.
Yeah, the neck hole thing, and I would appreciate it if you would say you're sorry.
Where do you come up with this stuff?
Geez, Hey you know something, you should try my friend's wake up service. She swears by this thing.
Uh, good. You know, you might wanna try eating it with one of these. (Holds up lobster bib)
No no no, you know actually we are friends of a serial killer.
What a fascinating turn of events. (Waitress approaches)
No no no, no mistake, no mistake. No, no , listen, we're going to get married over Christmas, I It doesn't make any difference to me. It's fine. Really.
What is with this dog, I thought we were taking it to the pound.
No everything is *not* going good. I'm very uncomfortable. I have no power. I mean, why should she have the upper hand. *Once* in my life I would like the upper hand. I have no hand-- no hand at all. She has the hand; I have *no* hand...
I think she wants me to take her home.
That's exactly what I said, except I used the word "momentum".
Aah, yeah, yeah. Won't you head on in, we'll be in in a second. Be right with you.
I just talked to Mr. Kruger, he'll be down in a minute. He wanted me to take a photograph for the record.
Okay, how about this? All right, we get married March 21st, the first day of Spring.
Yeah, but they let me go on and on all about the Hamptons, they never said a thing! You don't let somebody lie when they know you're lying. You call them a liar!
So I said, "Mr. Hayman, It's me george Costanza, JFK, ... " He doesn't move. So I said uh, "Can't stand ya'", "Can't stand ya'" He turns and smiles, the little baked bean teeth. I get up to run away, but something was holding me back. It was Heyman. He had my underwear. There I was on the steps of the 42nd St. library , a grown man, getting a wedgie.
No, no, no. Just lately, I've been thinking a lot clearer. Like this afternoon, (To television) what is chicken Kiev, (Back to Jerry) I really enjoyed watching a documentary with Louise.
Sir, I'm sure it's not a police matter.
Its a great thrill to meet you, Sir.
(Studying the salt shaker) I'm not taking a civil service test.
Great. Jerry, I gotta tell you, I had the BEST TIME with that Nina last night. I - I think I'm in love with her already. You are a great friend. (Hugs Jerry) A great, great friend.
What difference does it make what she looks like?
Um, all right, um, uh, I'll call 'ya. I'll call you and we'll talk on the phone. A telephone communiqu. Every thing is fine ok, uh, fine, .. [exits]
(embarrassed with a touch of unrestrained jubilation) Yes.
So, that's it. All of my darkest fears, and... everything I'm capable of. That's me.
Ok, fine. It's going to be very interesting, very interesting if they don't show up tonight. You know my mother made all this Paella.
I still have it. The collar's okay. I wear it under sweaters.
But Mr. Steinbrenner, how can I be expected to perform my job properly, knowing that my uh, subordinate is making more money than I am? With all due respect sir, it's outta whack.
I know. And now they want me to bottle it up. It makes me so mad!
I don't even think she'd notice it. Can you see it?
Did you ever go to a singles weekend in the Poconos?
All you got is instant coffee? Why don't you get some real coffee?
So... uh you feel okay about that whole thing... what we do in there... you're generally okay with everything in there?
Ah. You see, the man who was the butler, uh, had gotten into a car accident with Jerry, and because he didn't have any insurance, the judge decreed that the man become Jerry's butler.
She's like a district attorney. If it's not the truth, I'll break under the cross. I actually have to do it.
Aah! the minute I saw this girl, we just clicked. She's got such a nice face. hummmm her eyes, her mouth, nose
Yeah. I think we really go something here.
(hearing Jerry broke up with Patty) Are you still down in the dumps? Come on. It's just a chick.
They had a pastry cart you wouldn't believe.
Well what about all the Lloyd Braun sales?
I feel like I'm in bed with my mother.
Oh, look, he's going to ask you about my arm. So, just tell him I banged it against a desk. And it's been moving involuntarily ever since.
Shes an... etymologist. You know, bees, flies, gnats. W-What about you?
One little wink. She'll freak out, tell my parents. They'll be all over me. Who is this guy?
I've always liked her. Remember her in 'Carnal Knowledge'?
I know. I know. That's what I do. That's what I do.
You know what, bad mistake my mistake do me a favor go back to the other lane - you'll never get there - forget this lane - y'a kn ow what this lane stinks - go back to the other lane - bad decision - go go go take this light - take this light -
So, I am have to going to break up with you.
Ah, alright. Believe me, that kid's gonna be called Soda.
Hey, when you order from the waitress, get her to point to the menu. I want to see what finger she uses.
(still looking at that picture) You know if I told my engagement story to that receptionist, but told her this, was my fiance..
Brother Costanza will be taking the vow of silence.
Ill tell her I bumped into you, Im giving you a ride uptown.
So you're gonna let me get suspended for shower urination?
I went to the beach. (Jerry and Elaine exchange looks)
Here. Let me take your tabe downstairs for you.
What is that, immigrants come over, you show them how to act natural?
Y'know, I'm better with the mothers than I am with the daughters.
Excuse me, I'm sorry to bother you, I noticed that you have a textbook on tape. May I ask where you got that?
All right. You understand now? It's not that complicated.
And I always take care of my Pisano's. So here is a little something. (drop in tip and worker looks the other way, so George decides to take it out and try again only to get caught)
I know what you were trying to do. Nobody does it better than me.
OK, OK, I never even had him for gym.
She hasn't seen the article! When she sees it, she's gonna think-- *I'm out baby*!! I'm out!!!!!
I don't know, maybe a safe fell on her head.
(Annoyingly butting in) Kinda like Superman's fortress of solitude.
What are you worried about, you know it.
This must be Sheila from the photo place.
I have to do this, it's a matter of honor.
I know. This was like a record. My previous record was when Joni Hirsch asked me not to tell anybody that we slept together. Kept a lid on that for about 28 seconds.
Only I hold the answer key to their true candy identities. And so, without further ado, I give you the candy line-up. (Opens a door to a back room. Various dealership employees are munching on candy bars)
I got to give the players most of the credit for that.
Alright look, I'm gonna tell you, but I made a pact with Cynthia, we swore we were not going to tell you and Elaine.
Well I just stomped some pigeons in the park. They - they didn't move.
I can't come out. They're standing right by the door. Throw it up!
It was a good idea. Susan liked it. Now, if he hadn't vomitted all over her, we'd be writing it right now.
I couldn't. You know, if it's not about sports, I find it very hard to concentrate.
So you're a lawyer. What kind of cases do you handle?
(coyly, he looks down and runs his finger along the top of the chair back in front of him) Do you, uh ... do you know what Im ... thinking about now?
Every time we go out to eat the minute we we're done eating she's runnin to the bathroom.
I should've hit the little son-of-a-bitch. I can't stand kids. Adults think it's so wonderful how honest kids are. I don't need that kind of honesty. I'll take a deceptive adult over an honest kid any day.
There he is. Right on time as usual.
What about the whole Christmas spirit thing? Any flexability there?
You are a genius, it's as simple as that.
What were you saying to the Rosses over there, anyway?
No, no I do. You know it's just...
Oh, this is all locking in now. It is all locking in! (laughing)
(contemptuously, imitating Altons voice) Hes in the bathroom.
Oh, it was. But he claimed it was a 5th Avenue bar.
Well, she doesn't really want to see Firestorm.
Ah, excuse me. Do you have, uh, change of a dollar?
I don't need any ideas. It's a show about nothing.
Yes, because the water was cold... and the chewing warms me up.
Really? You like it? I got it at a flea market today.
Pamela?! Awright, I tell you what. You look like nice people, I'm gonna help you out. You want a beautiful name? Soda.
You, uh, wanted to see me, Mr. Steinbrenner?
And then in the fifth inning, why did you take off on the pop fly?
(putting the car in reverse) Oh beautiful! Look at that, the dream space right in front of Jerry's building. Huh? Dreams can come true, what did I tell you?
A little notice would've helped! How many people?
I dont know how you put up with this.
(Once again, Identifying) The Outlaw of Josey Whales!
Maybe it's some small thing I could change. Like a moustache. Or wearing a top hat, or a monocle, or a..or a cane.
You want me to find a poem about Susan? May she rest in peace?!
I'm the bad boy. I've never been the bad boy.
(animated) N..no, no. You can't leave me. (frantic) Marry me! I'll burn myself. I'll burn my parents!
I snapped! It was the last straw. (sighs)
This is not good. World's are colliding! George is getting upset!
Na, he's gone. I wonder what happened to him.
(Opens the door, looks in and then knocks 5 times) Mr. Steinbrenner, (waves) can I talk to you for a second?
Well I don't think she is a multiple sneezer, because she sneezed again later, and it was also a single.
I don't even know Peterman. How the hell am I gonna relax? I'm gonna have to be on all night. I don't like being on, Jerry, I would much rather be off.
Actually, I never had any formal training. I guess I'd be better suited for improvs, or something..
What was that line again? Something about finding your way in a shadow?
Well, my father works for the United Volunteers, maybe he can get her one.
You know she was behind the idea. She was going to champion the show. That's what I was bring her up there to tell you. And she liked me.
She had an itch. She could have used any one of those fingers. That finger was meant for me.
Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute, don't tell me, don't tell me. It starts with a . . . Duncan Meyers. Oh, wow, this is something. I haven't seen you guys in what, twenty years?
You know what the temperature in Florida is today? Eh? Seventy-nine. That's almost eighty. Yeah, I read someplace the life expectancy in Florida is eighty-one and in Queens, seventy-three.
I...I...write a letter and then I..I go to China. I disappear in a sea of people for like six months, a year you know just while things simmer down. Ehm.. Ehm...Dear Susan. I'm sorry. I made a terrible mistake. I'm really , really sorry.
(hitting Cynthia playfully with a napkin) Stop it, stop it.
So, we watching the movie, or are we still talking? (Joe's wife shakes her head and goes into the other room. George gestures to Remy to move.) Okay, c'mon. Let's go.
Oh, deserve! I don't know if I deserve...I mean...
(sets down his paper) So how were the eggs?
Does she care? No. Does anyone ever display the slightest sensitivity over the problems of a fellow individual? No. No. A resounding no!
(Frantic) Kramer, do you know what those guys are gonna do to me?!
He scratches off a 32 and he puts in 31.
Alright, I gotta go home and open up with the house for the carpet cleaners. You know they're doing my whole place for twenty-five dollars.
I can produce Keith Hernandez right here within the hour.
Yeah. Hmm. Boy these really do pinch. I tell you, if I ever find the son of a bitch that stole my glasses...
You know, that, that thing about her being too good for him. I mean, I was just bein' folksy. They could tell I was just being folksy..?
Then, why? Why did you make me drive all the way out here? Why didn't you say something? Why? Why? Why?
Well there is traffic. It might take her till eight-fifteen.
So, whaddya say? You know you'll always be the only man I'll ever love.
That's why I peeked. (Jerry opens the door to take some trash out, and meets Kramer and Gail in the hallway.)
Hey, last night, I found a whole Weeble Village right behind the EZ Bake oven.
(Again, sarcastic) Oh, what a huge blow to the culture.
Yeah, Well that's a deal where I come from.
(as Jerry and Elaine continue to whine) Give it! Give it! (he finally gets the remote away from them) Pinheads.
[whispering] Elaine? [loud whisper] Elaine! [louder whisper] Elaine!
Ha! (snort) Can you believe it? (amused) I'm supposed to be havin' lunch with her right now at Pomodoro.
Me too. I've been yelling at strangers on the street.
(to Jerry, yelling) You told her? She's not your wife!
I'm engaged to Mr. Ross' niece. I'm probably gonna be taking over this whole place someday so if I were you I would stay on my good side.
(Suggesting) Maybe she's a nudist. You know, those nudist colony people..
Boy - I'm really surprised at Elaine - that whole phone business - she should know better than that.
What are they doin' lettin' you bastards on an airplane? Don't they know that's against FAA regulation?
Well I, uh, I'm not sure how you pronounce it or anything, but I, uh, I believe it's Mnage  Trois?
I dont know. But Simons said that if I wanted to get involved, that Wilkinson would tell me the exact right minute to sell. You wanna do it?
No, no no it's not about postponing. I just think the first day of Spring is the perfect day to get married. You know, Spring! Rejuvenation! Rebirth! Everything is blooming all the
Just need to uh, to dig 'em up.
(sidling in) Is this a bad time? I hope I'm not disturbing anything.
That should be 14, let me just...(corrects it with a pen.)
What are you talking about? (Jerry grins) You're not!
Where are you meeting these women? When they get off the bus at the port authority?
It's just a magnificent stone. (turns to Jerry) Jerry?
You hear the way he talks to me?
I gotta try and find a way to switch places with him. It's like a Sigfried and Roy trick.
What ever they had. Miranda thinks I'm a butcher but i-i-it's not my fault is it? Don't we have a deal with the pigeons?
Oh yeah! Middle finger, straight up, at me! At us!
But I know who took the bite. It was her aunt!
(sarcasm) Hu-hu, like I don't know that? (excitement) My Cousin Vinnie, I love that! I, George Costanza, could be on a date with an Oscar winner! An Oscar winner, Jerry! You know what that's like? It's like if fifty years ago, someone fixed me up with Katherine Hepburn? Same thing!
Oh, yeah. Still in good with the ground crew. (Laghs)
[quite out loud, not even pretending to whisper] Elaine!
Are you kidding? I lie every second of the day. My whole life is a sham!
Out of the question. Out of the question!
Well I can't break up with her now.
What, you are comparing me to Biff Loman, very encouraging. The biggest loser in history of American literature.
Yes, Id like to report a problem with one of your mechanics.
Yeah? Well, I had sex with your wife.
I look like me and I'm working from the outside. Who do you think is in the better position?
All right, you know you're not any help at all here. I don't know what even the point is of talking to you anymore.
I am not! What you call wasting, I call living! I'm living my life!
Oh I'm seeing someone, yes. You know her, Daphne Bower.
but..why, it wasn't my fault, I .. you asked me a sandwich, I .. I make such delicious sandwiches Elaine
It's really nothing, it's like going to the dentist.
Oh, don't look. T-This is the part where they change me.
Oh ya, like there's something wrong with saying 'God bless you'. I was raised to say 'God bless you'.
Hey I get a free trip to Paris, I go in the Big Brother's Hall-of-Fame, I mail my own postcards.
Oh I would love that. You think he'd really do it?
Like if she wants to know if I'm pleased with something, she'll say, "Happy, Pappy?"
Why don't you just get some Ring Dings from the liquor store?
(The damage has been done. He is slightly angered at Jerry) May I ask, what do you read in the bathroom?
No. I wouldnt even have to tell her. I could surprise her.
You know, Louise. I think you'll find this amusing. In early Euclidean geometry--
You-you sure you never slept with her? (Jerry shakes his head 'no') Perfect.
You can't tell him the truth, you're gonna blow the whole thing.
That's right...We just had sex......You know Jerry I've been searching for someone a long time. Well the search is over.
I heard the last guy got fired because his nose whislted.
Why, you think you can, beat me up?
Toasting makes me uncomfortable. But toast, I love. Never start the day without a good piece of toast. In fact, let's toast to toast.
Elaine, I got to have another picture of Gillian.
(Still on the showers) Can I use hot water on my face?
I think hitting a defenseless child is my business.
Alright, I just have to go over to the Ross' apartment and drop off Susan's sunglasses. You'll come with me?
It's in Detroit though, it's an expensive flight.
Alright, listen, I'll give you your spare keys, but I don't have them with me. Can I please have mine to give to back to Kramer?
I have tell you, I'm pretty impressed with the first one.
Yo, dad. This is my boss, Mr. Kruger.
S'cuse me ..Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?
Oh, what? What? That? Are you kidding? I didn't quit. What? You took that seriously?
(Defensively loud) It was when I was banging!
Really? My father has a ton of old clothes just sitting up in the attic, y-you think they're worth something?
Of course not. I mean sure, there may have been one or two occasions in the past, when I may have reacted in uh impulsive or somewhat immature manner, but those days are well behind me.
All right Bubble Boy. Let's just play... Who invaded Spain in the 8th century?
Ah, listen ah, I don't mean to bother you but ah, silly me, I- I think I may have left my hat in your apartment. So ah, I thought I'd just come by later and pick it up.
What a bald paradise that must have been. Nobody knew.
(Looking at her nose) Is your nose pierced?
(to Jay) What do you think it is?
(Stuttering) I, I, I, .. here, let me - let me help you..
She kept such a nice clean apartment. She was so sanitary.
Yeah. Yeah. With all that kissing and the shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy out in public like that. It's disgusting!
I dont know. All of em. Theyre all crooks! Besides, I couldnt get all different candy bars, anyway.
This is my ketchup. I bought this ketchup just so I could have as much as I want.
Mrs. Sweedler thank you. Y-You see, this tragedy affected me in a very, very personal way.
Kramer, hey, hey! (Gets up out of his seat)
Uh, I just went out, I went to look for my friend?
(urgent whisper) Elaine! You have got to get me Marisa Tomei's phone number!
(Holding camera) Look at this, I only have one picture left... How 'bout a shot of me and Mr. Morgan?
So you - you really don't have my hat?
They send me? Aw right ..ask 'em Does it really work?
What do we have in the fruit department?
(reluctant) Oh that uh, that seems like a lotta trouble.
I don't even know her sister but believe me, if she's getting traffic tickets, she's not that good-looking! Woah
What do you mean not goin'? Come on, we got plans here. Call her up.
Yeah, I told her how toilet paper hasn't changed in my lifetime, and probably wouldn't change in the next fifty thousand years and she was fascinated, fascinated!
Oh, its a lovely song. (singing) How do you solve a problem like Maria?...
You don't listen when people talk to you anymore!
Why should she like me? Who am I? Huh, there's a million people to like.
(Takes it and throws it out window) Get outta my way!
They all have swirling chocolate in the commercial!
Hey, I know what I'm talking about. I gotta be honest with you, I gotta tell ya... Ever since I saw you holding hands with that woman, I can't get you out of my mind.
Wait a second, wait a second, what coming in, what woman is coming in?
(walking back) Are you sure? 'Cause it could really help me out of a jam.
Okay, I guess I'll see you down there.
They would never tell me, Elaine. First of all, they probably think that I killed Susan. Besides, I don't even think they like me. (Jerry comes over to the table.)
That's a very good question. You know she and I go out for dinner, she doesn't even reach for the check. That?s all I?m asking for is a reach. Is that so much to ask for?
I dont think theres ever been an appointment in my life where I wanted the other guy to show up. (George notices an elderly man in a leather chair.) Wait a second, is that him?
You told David Putty your move and you didn't tell *me*? I *need* a move. You know I have no moves, Jerry. (points to the candy bar) Gimme a bite.
'My wife's in a coma.' Yeah? Well, the life support machine called and...
No, I, uh, um, wa, wa, What did I do? ... Where are you going?
A preemptive breakup. This is an incredible idea. I got nothing to lose. We either break up which she would do anyway but at least I go out with some Dignity. Completely turn the tables. It's absolutely brilliant.
Somebody double parked and blocked us in. D-DOES ANYBODY KNOW WHOSE CAR THAT IS? Maybe there's a note on it. Ohh-oh brother. No, no note. Can you believe this?
I got it. Cups in the front, loops in the back. (puts the bra on the table)
Let me be the architect! I can do it!
Did you ever solve the riddle of the pie?
She thinks I'm a nice guy. Women always think I'm nice, but women don'tnice.
(Losing it) does not imply transfer of ownership. Moe, Sol, or Lem is not gonna get away with this!
Yeah, so what? I'm not the only one! (Kramer enters with his quilt.)
I dont know, what were doin here, this is ridiculous.
Yeah, yeah, not fan talk, not gushing, you know? Actual conversation, I was incredibly articulate!
You only went in front first 'cause you saw me backing up and you didn't have room to parallel park!
Yeah. I am like a drug dealer. I got the guy hooked. I am having lunch at his desk everyday this week. He doesn't make a move without me. It's very exciting.
(Obviously knows that, but pretends he doesn't) What, tonight? Now?
(ahem) In this age of uncertainty and confusion, a man begins to ask himself certain questions. How can one even begin to put into words something so um (trying to think of a word)
(Runs over to him, not wanting him to leave) What? You're going?
Huh? You know? Spring. Rejuvenation. Rebirth. Everything's blooming. All that crap.
(wiping the area with a hand) People think they're so important...
I don't understand, how do these thieves start the car?
(pauses to consider this then gives in) All right. (starts heading towards bedroom)
It gets here when it gets here. Would you stop ridin' me?
I think we got a bite on it. (Exits)
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. As long as youre going to lie to the guy, why dont you tell him that you lost both of the tickets, then we can go?
Alright that's it. (George walks across the room over to them.) So you get rid of me and now the two of you are going to sleep together?
(light) No. No, no, no. The cushion was turned over.
(knocks on the window) Hey, why are all those people milling around my car?
Can I say one word to you? Lobster. The lobster here is unbelievable. (looks at the menu) Ooh, a little expensive.
Do you wanna talk about hotels, or do you wanna win some ball games?
Uh Jerry, how long will you be in there?
Well what's in this giant box out in the hall?
Oh, *please*! Me? C'mon! That's *great*! Are you kidding? I think thats fan*tastic*! I've always encouraged experimentation! I'm the first guy in the pool! Who do you think you're talking to?
All he has to do now is count his blessings, say a prayer, and he's done. Do you believe this?
No, no. It wasn't a shift, I've shifted, this was a move.
May I just use your bathroom for a moment?
Look, I'm doing you a favor. They're having an unadvertised sale. This suit is gonna be half-priced starting ... Monday.
So, he made an appointment for me to see Dinkins' doctor. He's just trying to humiliate me.
Look, I gotta tell ya...I been thinkin' about it, I just don't feel right about letting you into Elaine's apartment.
I don't know. I don't think you're anything.
Cold? How are you going to do that? You're not one of those guys.
Oh, yes. I already packed up my desk, sir. I can be outta here in an hour.
You wanted a Yankee, I got you a Yankee.
How could that piece of *crap* cost $98.00!?
well I don't know if there's gonna be any place to eat up there
Of course, not as exciting as miss crop circles, but...
Oh yeah the nipple. But besides that. How did you feel about Kramer's work?
No, I'm gonna hold it under her nose so she can smell the scent of stale Bosco that I had to live with for three years, and I'm gonna say, "Remember this shirt, baby?! Well, now, it's payback time!"
Of course, I'm the result of my parents having stayed together, so you never know. (Russell comes out of the bathroom.)
(Sliding over to make room for her) Sit down. Join us, please.
I don't know how you can let this guy handle all your money.
Just do it like a Band-Aid. One motion. Right off! (beat) She is sexy though. Dont you think?
(Snaps, then points to the coffee table) Hand me an Emory board.
All right, so are you ready, so we'll go out and get something to eat.
Beautiful women. You know they could get away with murder. You never she any of them lift anything over three pounds. They get whatever they want whenever they want it. You can't stop them.
I know what the problem is - I like her too much. That's why I can't make a move.
Oh, I had no choice. She squeezed it out of me! Shed tell me she loved me. All right, at first, I just look at her. Id go, Oh, really? Or uh, Boy, thats, thats something. But, eventually you have to come back with, Well, I love you. You know, you can only hold out for so long.
I think I understand this. Jay Peterman is real. His biography is not. Now, you Kramer are real.
What is it about sex that just disrupts everything? Is it the touching? Is it the nudity?
(ignoring Jerry) I mean I'm not really working right now.
Because I know him too, and probably a lot better than you.
Boy, my knuckles are still cramped from that football game.
She can't take it. It's not hers, it's theirs. Once there's no theirs there's no hers, it should be ours.
Officer, could I just explain something to you?
you said "step off"? wow, that is too much hey..huh hey (George turns the cap his wearing backwards like Tony) Tony, I huh, I just had this brainstorm for us. Can you guess what it is?
What for? . I'll tell you what for.... for hair.
Im the judge and the jury, pal. And the verdict is guilty!
Yeah. She should be commending me for treating everyone like equals.
No! (The salesman walks away. He addresses the mechanic through the doors window) Hey! Hey! I see you! That is my Twix! (The mechanic eats the last of the Twix, obviously to make George even more angered. It works) Oh, ha, ha! Ho, ho!
I, I really should go home. Ya.. actually I'm planning on spending the day with my father tomorrow (short laugh) we're uh we're going to a father-son picnic, just the two of us.
Hes a cube. Anyway, he got married six months ago. He told me ever since hes been wearing a wedding band, women have been coming on to him everywhere he goes.
So, she's the loser of the group. Every group has someone that they all make fun of.. Like us with Elaine. (Jerry thinks about this, then shakes it off)
Its amazing. We, we both have dates on the same night. I cant remember the last time that happened.
Oh, man, it's spinach! I've been walking around like this all afternoon.
Why didn't you ask me? I know a million theater jokes. 'What's the deal with those guys down in the pit?'
Why did France give that to us anyway?
(angry undertone) Oh, I'm gonna give you a Royal bearing. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Lemme get a pack of gum here.
I'm out! Fantastic apartment right across from mine, huh. I can't wait for you to see it.
(answering the phone while walking away) Joe Mayo's apartment?
Of course you do... It's just, uh, y'know, I-I never *knew*, uh, that, uh...
(frustrated) Take it easy! Huh! Take it easy!
I don't even know what they think. That's why I'm in therapy.
Hey listen... umm, instead of the movie... uh, maybe we'll go back and uh you know...(nudges her head with his head)
Did you dressed nice, did you do it classy?
Dwayne, my friend and I would like to exchange frames. Could you put his lenses in my frames and mine in his?
Ah, ...A beautiful successful intelligent woman's in love with me and I throw it all away. uh oh boy. Now I'll spend the rest of my life living alone. I'll sit in my disgusting little apartment watching basketball games, eating Chinese take out. Walking around with no underwear. Because I'm too lazy to do a laundry.
Why don't you think before you do something?
(Slowly backing away, he's not at all committed to the conversation) Yeah.. television.
Jerry, for all I know this guy went out of his way to not invite you. How am I gonna feel if I show up with an uninvited, unwelcome intruder?
So, anyway, what's uh, what's the status with, uh...
We sat there for twenty minutes, chewing, staring at each other in a defunct relationship.
After dark? Please. At their age, that's like swallowing stun grenades.
The attic? Y-you haven't wore any of those clothes for years.
Is he a clown? What, are you kidding me!?
You know what you should do? You should tell this guy you're seeing somebody else. That's the easiest way to get out of these things.
Yes, yes of course. The Pensky file. Ho ho, can't wait to sink my teeth into that. Wow that Pensky. Well we'll straighten him out.
Elaine you don't understand. I had 103 temperature when I bought that sweater. I was so dizzy I was seeing red dots everywhere. I thought everything in the store had a red dot on it. I couldn't distinguish one red dot from another. I couldn't afford anything. I have nothing. I haven't worked for a really long time. (Jerry is standing right behind George. Jerry takes out a hankerchief and starts fake-crying in it.) I mean look, I have no clothes, look at what I'm wearing. It's just a little red dot.
You only think that because you know me.
All right. All right. Let's - let's go over that again.
I dont understand, you never talk to her about other women?
(we hear him think) My friends are idiots, she doesn't look like Jerry. She doesn't look like anybody. And so what if does look like Jerry,what does that mean?. That I could have everything I have with Jerry but because it's a woman I could also have sex with her....And that somehow that would be exactly what I always wanted.....She doesn't even look like Jerry..
I have a point, I have a point.
Would you stop that? It's not safe to be jumping up and down on a plane.
(tearing out cheque) Yeah, same time. (hands over cheque) There you go.
Excuse me, uh, what are you doing in there?
What's the deal with Aquaman? Could he go on land, or was he just restricted to water?
Ha ha ha ha, oh all right, go ahead, deride, deride if you must. But let me tell you something, with my personality and this set of hair, you know what I am now? I am in the game. I no longer defer to the coifed. I'm a player.
Jon Voight! Are you kiddin' me? Did you talk to him?
Well what if she calls me? What am I supposed to say?! (hand hits the table)
It was more like a full bodied dry heave set to music.
Nah, with crutches it's a funny story, with a cane it's a sad story. You through with those?
(Nervous) Wh-what are you talking about? That - that's rediculous.
The prop comic? (Ronnie holds up his water gun and smiles.) Oh, hi...I didn't recognize you, what...did you get a haircut?
Pst. (moves in close with Elaine and Jerry) Wilkinsons got a bite on a new one. Petramco Corp. Out of, uh Springfield. I think. Theyre about to introduce some sort of a robot butcher.
You know, about how when you break it down, it's really a very positive thing. you know, you have a nure, with a ma in front of it. MA-NURE. Iz not bad.
There you go, okay? That's my *other* friend's ticket. You happy now? You got two tickets.
Summer of '89 I'm at the beach. This family sits up next to me. I go in to the surfs and when I come from out, my clothes, my towel, my umbrella, they're all gone. I am furious, I start screaming to these kids demanding my stuff back and finally I lose it; I grab their boom box and I chuck it in to the ocean.
Where? (He looks out window and gets hit by a tomato)
Alright, now you're gonna see some parallel parking. (spitting into his hands and rubbing them together) How I wish you could make a living parallel parking. (turning around in his seat) It's all geometry, knowing all the angles, when to make that first turn and then when to swing it back in, that's the key.
I guess that leaves me in the clear...
So I really liked the pictures I picked up here yesterday.
No. I like the ball! This is my One Chance to make a Great Entrance! My whole life! I have never made a great entrance!
No, it's a Newman. Well, I gotta run. (Smiles, pats his briefcase and exits.)
Your friend is been accused of being a serial killer. I think that qualifies.
(sad) Yeah! Yeah. Hey--hey you, you know.. Maybe I'll call you sometime.
Y'know, now you gotta ask her her name. It's so embarrassing.
(standing) Yes, payroll. Yes I did. Very productive. Payroll... Paid off.
Hey, did you know that the Yankees don't wear cotton jerseys?
Are there terrorists on the plane? A hotel fire. Is that it? Malaria? Yellow fever? Lupus? Is it Lupus?
I dunno, I'm in a limo. (dials) Hello ma? It's me. Guess where I am. In the back of a limo. No, nobody died. It's a long story, I can't tell you now. Because I can't. I said I can't. If I could, I would. Would you stop it? Alright, look, I'm getting off. No, I'm not telling you! How's this? I'm *never* telling you! I don't care! No! Fine! Never!!
Yeah, much better. All right, so what's the move, because I need *something*. This woman I'm dating, it's like she's doing her nails during love-making.
Then I see my clothes floating out there. The tied took them out, not the kids.
Men have been popping into my sexual fantasies. All of a sudden I'll be, in the middle.
That's dynamite. Yeah, I'll look for the Chinese food leftovers.
(through a mouthful of shrimp) Well, why don't we just put a monitor in his skybox?
You know what I do at the Yankees, when one of these old guys is breathing down my neck?
Alright I happen to know what they did last night, they had dinner with Kramer.
All right, I think they have fleas there. So what...
Every day she comes in, she sits at that table and reads. Never talks to anybody.
Jerry, let's face it, I've always been handicapped. I'm just now getting the recognition for it. Name one thing I have that puts me in a position of advantage. Huh? There was a guy that worked at the Yankees-- no arms! He got more work done than I did, made more money, had a wife, a family, drove a better car than I did.
Oh, yeah. I read what you said to the papers yesterday. You weren't in on the planing. What planning? YOU THINK WE PLANED THIS? Uh?
(turning to each other) I dont know. Hes an importer.
I don't know why I bother even talking to you.
Look at this. There's no spaces here. (to another car) Excuse me, are you gettin' out?
A cup of coffee. That, that doesn't mean anything.
Oh, I think that's fantastic. Good for you. Nice. That's very nice.
Yes, Im Sorry, it's a new coat. It-it's Gore-Tex.
That's not how it happened. It's when he fell on him with his knee.
You mean a walk back in? That's the toughest move in the business. You're sending me out into no-mans-land, and if I get shot down I have to crawl all the way back. Well I can't do it! I can't do it, I tell ya!
I can't perform under pressure. That's why I never play anything for money, I choke. I could choke tonight. And she works in my office, can you imagine? She goes around telling everyone what happened? Maybe I should cancel, I have a very bad feeling about this.
What am I supposed to get, a bazooka?
Cause I tell you, frankly, I would like to walk in hear one day and find you sitting down. (Starts to walk out of the store) That would give me a lot of pleasure. Call me crazy.
Great! (snaps fingers and grabs the extra plane ticket) Nina could go, huh? Jerry, this is great. You and Elaine. Me and Nina.
She didn't want to come, she-she's not really into sports.
Oh my God. I must be crazy. What have I done?
(singing) Master of the House/Quick to catch your eye/Never wants a passerby to pass him by...
So, just bring her here. This is all you really need.
Well I just got the estimate. It's going to cost more to fix that roof than the car's worth, So I'm going over to see that hospital administrator today. Someone is gonna pay for this damage and it's not gonna be me.
Well, you didn't hear it from me, but needless to say, if you go in there - stick with the consumee.
I forgot to ask you; how did the revenge date go?
What am I talking about? Come on. (laughing) You don't think I bought all that? (does a little move)
Would you stop it. (Susan playfully bites his ear lobe again) Would you quit it please. Someone is going to see us here.
(attacking Kramer) How could you give me a defective condom?!
He wouldn't put it on if he didn't like it.
(Looks at her) Yeah, uh, no menus. (Waves her off)
Hey, by the way, if anybody wants an inside tour of the zoo, Siena works there as a trainer.
So, I've got ice cream all over my face. There were no napkins there. Whoever it was that's responsible for stocking that concession stand cost me a relationship.
So she's just sitting there, she's having a pleasant conversation... and all of a sudden.
So you don't speak *any* English at all?
All right, just gimme that. And gimme some of those Sweet & Lows.
I can't have an affair with a married woman, that's despicable!
Yeah, and, ... Why won't this go down?
Well, at the Yankees it was all about smoothing things over, you know, chiseling away, grinding down. In fact we used to call it 'the grind'.
Anyway it's kind of a fluke thing but uh I'll be leaving for Paris in two days. I will send you a postcard when I get there.
I didn't even know it was a job.
No. Why must it be so difficult? Why is there all this tension and hostility? Why can't I just walk up to a woman on the street and say, "Hi. I'm
(quietly) ehh. (pausing to look at both of them) So what made you change your mind?
Dollar Eighty-Nine. Why is this a dollar eighty-nine? Why is there no haggling in this country?
Step-skipper. That man is a step-skipper! He skips Step Nine!
I think he should wear whatever tie he wants.
Oh, I don't think you want to do that.
Can't you think of something. Call in a bomb threat.
Great. (They both stand.) Oh, by the way, did you get a chance to read the script?
(pointing to Jerry in joyous agreement) Ha-ha-hah. This is my lucky day.
What's the difference? The money is not important.
I don't know how a fish could eat laughs.
Wait a second. Think about it. He's not showing up. Wait till you see the line of cabs, its like forty-five minutes long. You said he's in Chicago.
That's where I come in. Umm, on splat. Uh, you see, Mrs. Sweedler, or is it hospital administrator Sweedler?
Nose. (chuckles) What's the worst that can happen to a nose? What does it get? Stuffed? (chuckles)
(breaks a long silence) The uh, the shoe laces that you bought me, they uh, they worked out well. (thumbs up)
Jerry, I can't talk to Jerry anymore. Ever since he moved into that apartment he's too much ... like you.
Someday, before I die, mark my words - I'm gonna tell that woman exactly what I think of her. I'll never be able to forgive myself until I do.
Do you know how much this is going to cost me?
Yeah. A couple of people. I don't get that, though. Where do you start?
I didn't know whether to try and keep her from falling, or zip up.
Hey, the Bull owes me one, I helped him with his swing.
Well you know what I've discovered Mrs. Sokol. It's not so much the looking as the listening. I listen for work. And as I'm looking and listening I am also looking. You can't discount looking. It's sort of a combination. It's looking, and listening, listening and looking. But you must look.
Well it's not up my alley! It's one thing if I make it up. I know what I'm doin, I know my alleys! You got me in the Galapagos Islands livin' with the turtles, I don't know where the hell I am.
I'm wearin' a little hat, I'm jumpin' through fire.. They're puttin' their little alien heads in my mouth..
Hey Kramer, c'mon-- it was 240 bucks twenty years ago...
Yeah, and a whole new me. I'm up two inches in these babies!
(Inquiring about the chalk board) What is this?
He might as well have! I caught him, and his face was covered in chocolate and cookie crumbs.
You might want to try it...makes the movie more enjoyable, that's all.
Were you just talking about me? What's going on?
(coming back in) Alright, alright. Can we go out and eat?
Look, I really appreciate your coming, but if you wouldn't mind - try not to say too much.
Yup. It's really just a question of what kind. Thinking about a bar stool.
(pops his head out of the covers, looking a bit confused) Uh...you know, uh...pleasuring you.
I tried to be nice. I wasn't nice?
Alright, alright, I'll call Heather, you'll get your hat back, I will get a second date. Ha ha ha. Now watch the magic.
Oh, you haven't heard, she's going to live with her grandparents in Redding Pennsylvania.
What are you doing? You're making more than I am. A secretary cannot make more than her boss.
Hi Beth (Scene Ends then re-begins with Beth and George on Beth's couch) Um anyway Jerry told me that uh.. it might have been my comment in the Coffee Shop that broke you up.
So he... had his hands and, uh, he was uh
Sid, who's gonna move the cars while you're away?
Awright, lemme just say this. Ten thousand dollars, alright, and now I'm going below what you wanted to pay. You have your dinner, have your veal, or whatever it is. Enjoy...
Well, you know, I've been lyin' about my income for a few years. I figured I could afford a fake house in the Hamptons.
Really? Because people do meet in places besides a bar, huh?
And people come in the store and you get involved in their lives.
I went to look in the mirror, it wasn't there. You threw off my equilibrium.
Why did it all turn out like this for me? I had so much promise. I was personable, I was bright. (Elaine turns showing disagreement) Oh, maybe not academically speaking, (Elaine nods correct) I was perceptive. I always know when someone's uncomfortable at a party.
Ahh! (closes his eyes and rolling his head back) Umh!
(frantic) Jerry! Jerry, muh--muh--my hair-dryer ruined the picture! An' I need another one or I can't get back into the forbidden city!
I knew this was gonna happen some day. It was inevitable. I've known it ever since I was a little kid. I've been waiting for it.
Eh, gee, I hope you have the key for these things.
I once told a woman that I really enjoy spending time with my family.
Aw, Mr. Kruger, Sir. Merry Christmas! (Hands him a card)
[to himself] Oh, my God! It's Susan! What do I do?
Oh, he'll be here. By the way, Elaine, (reaches under the table and brings out a large coffee machine) thank you for laying out for the Arabian mocha java.
(grabbing the sweater back) Well it's not really damaged. 85 dollars huh?
Yeah, you're right, you're right. (To Elaine) Alright, maybe he's not interested, but you still know him - can't you just ask him?
So I'm dressing and she's staring up at me, struggling to compute this unprecedented turn of events. I don't know what to say to reassure this woman, and worst of all, I don't have the time to say it. The only excuse she might possibly have accepted is if I told her I am in reality Batman, and I'm very sorry, I just saw the Bat-Signal. It took me 3 days of phone calls to get her to agree to see me again. Now she's waiting for me to call her, and she's
Yes, I, uh, I need to return this book.
Jerry, it's fantastic. I love the people over there. They- they treat me so great. You know they think I'm handicapped, they gave me this incredible office, a great view.
I think he's saying 'Son of Sam'! Oh, my God!
(anxious) I forgot who I am! Who am I?!
I suppose he could swivel. Hey maybe one of those director's chairs. What do you think of those.
Come on, wanna give me a hand with the computers?
Well, I like to stay in touch with the people.
We are really late now. We're in big trouble. Big trouble.
Personally I'm a little nervous about going through these things. I'm afraid I'm gonna step through into another dimension.
I don't know. This sandwich is making me flush.
She's too tanned. It's the middle of the winter, she's like a carrot.
(Yelling out to a waitress) Gonna need some water here!
Eh, but, you know, Mr. Ross, if - if you look at the whole situating, what with it being your cigars, and everything, it's really rather ironic - one might even say, in a sense, comical.. (Mr. Ross has, by now, left the room. Mrs. Ross is pointing at George, nodding, laughing. As if to say he hit the bullseye. George calls out to Mr. Ross) Really. Think about it.
The network executive. You think she liked me?
Well she apologized, and then she wanted to know if we could get together Wednesday afternoon.
. We should be having dinner with our sons when we're sixty.
First she screams, "George, what are you doing?! My God!" And it looked like she was gonna faint - she started clutching the wall, trying to hang onto it.
Elaine, bald men, with no jobs, and no money, who live with their parents, don't approach strange women.
Except for one small problem. Hah, I left some books in her apartment.
Huh, he's a communist. . . . Look at this. "Exciting uninhibited woman seeks forward thinking comrade and appearance not important." . . . Appearance Not Important! This is unbelievable. Finally this is an ideology I can embrace.
(frustrated) Fine. Fine. (to customer) Excuse me. (heading for the door) Think I'm gonna forget about this? I haven't forgotten about this. I don't forget that easily!
(getting excited) That's, that's incredible. My Cousin Vinnie, I love her, she was fantastic!
I know it's a doll, but it looks like my mother!
(talking on the phone) Jerry you gotta bring me some clothes down here. I lost my job with the Yankees. I'm standing in the men's room on 43rd street in my underpants.
(spins his chair back to face her) So you got a $25,000 a year raise.
Well, here you go. What do you think?
Don't you see how wrong that is?! Where's your Christmas spirit? And eye for an eye!
The man in the cape--I bet you he is mixed up in this! I don't trust men in capes.
This MacKenzie, he's a bit of a nut. Someone told me he fired the last guy because his nose whistled when he breathed.
You got your own shampoo, conditioner, body lotion! Jerry, body
No, that's my only suit. It cost me 350 dollars. I got it at Moe Ginsburg.
Y'know there are tribes in Indonesia where if you keep your coat on in somebody's house, the families go to war!
I told you those trips were relationship killers. Too bad you cant get your buddy Superman to fly around the Earth at super speed and reverse time. Youd get all the money back, you could have avoided the whole trip to Vermont...
I didn't do it! It..It just got done. I don't know how it got done, but it did.
Ya know, I was just a little surprised.
Don't you see what this says? How can you possibly like somebody ,if you think they look like this?
It's "ooh" As in "ooh ooh ah ah."
All right, shes not even gonna ask, if we see her, which is remote.
(Trying to whisper to Jerry) Look, we are gonna settle this right now! I demand reparations! I should get to sleep with Elaine. That's the only way to punish you!
Ah, Pfft! What can you do? (looking at a tag on the suit) Is this the price tag?
Ever since I found out that you let that message on Jerry's tape recorder I...
(through a mouthful) Long as they don't throw 'em on the field. (laughs) Huhu. (indicating dish) Help yourself to some shrimp, I brought enough for everybody.
I need a break, Jerry, you know. I gotta get out of the city. I feel so cramped...
Guess who he put in charge of Fitted Hat Day? Me.
Yes she is. It's a pity we won't be seeing much more of her.
Channel eleven? Forgive me for trying to class up this place, for trying to have the Yankees reach another strata of society that might not watch channel eleven.
You know Elaine, I'd do it but I'm working that day.
It just didnt work out. What can I do? I wanted to love her. I tried to love her. I couldnt.
Could we talk about this some other time?
Oh, yeah, sure, accident, right. She was aiming right at me like she was putting out a fire! Then, for the rest of the show, I'm sitting there with chocolate all over my shirt. Flies are landing on me. I'm boiling - I'm fantasizing all the things I'm gonna say when I see her. And later, finally, backstage when I talk to her, I'm a groveling worm. "What kind of chocolate was that? Do you throw any other foods?"
I was so shocked I was lucky I said anything.
What if I want to walk around a little?
(knocks) You hem... wanted to see me Mr. Steinbrenner?"
I mean he's a good fighter and a nice guy but I don't like him.
If you had like five chickens could you tell them apart by just the way they acted? Or would they all just be walking around? Bak, bak, baak, bak? Cause if they have individual personalities Im not sure we should be eaten `em. What's the matter with you?
What did I get or what do I say I got?
Oh, its a great place, its uh two-bedroom uh, west 83rd bout half block from the park.
You are a good friend. You know what? Even if you killed somebody I wouldn't turn you in.
I dont know. But I dont. Im actually almost happy to hear it.
Oh ya, This is my fiance, Susan. This is David
I don't have a spare set. All my keys say 'do not duplicate'.
Thank you very much. (Peggy leaves the menus and walks away) So guess what I got do tomorrow?
Yes! And I put him up to it, because I'm sick! I'm the one that needs help.
Just tell her whatcha want, they'll make it for ya.
I can't believe you called me a chucker. No way I'm a chucker, I do not chuck, never chucked, never have chucked, never will chuck, no chuck!
What are these? (Holds test tubes to his head like antennae) Take me to your leader.
I keep wracking my brain to try and figure out what I did. I was smart, I was funny, I made great small talk with the waitress so she could see I could relate to the commoners, you know, I'm a man of the people.
I, I think I made my point. I'm sorry if I was a little harsh.
I have to get in touch with Tatiana! And look at his little outfit. It's all so coordinated, the way his socks matching to his shirt. I really hate this guy.
Did you happen to notice that Julie handed the big salad to Elaine?
Well good, good. Take it off you're going to wear it out already. It's for special occasions this thing.
Great move, telling him, by the way, real smart move.
Im keeping it. Im going down with the ship.
There she is. (waiving his arms quickly above the table - to nix the conversation) No no no no no no.
The whole hour just flew by. (laughs - hehe) (Begins cleaning up the table.)
(talking to nobody) Nah. It's probably a union thing.
They wish. I hate the big broker-houses. Hate them with a passion. Big broker-houses killed my father.
Why don't you give me the twenty, and I'll stop and get change, and then you and I can... uh... you-know, settle.
I, uh, should have a poem very soon now.
(improvising) My uh uncle is having an operation. I just wanted to see how he was.
(Struggling) No, no, no, no. I can walk it off. It's a hundred and twenty degrees in here.. I'll sweat it out.
Mr. Morgan! Did you hear that? Mr. Morgan!
Twelve dollars? I knew we should have gone to the bakery. I guarantee you theyre not getting no twelve dollar cake.
You know what? I think this Ruthie Cohen gave me the wrong change. Didn't I pay with a twenty? I'm sure I paid with a twenty.
. . . I thought the woman was kind of cute.
You can stuff you sorries in a sack, mister!
Yeah, as a matter of fact, I did.
You see, my friend here, his aunt passed away last night.
Oh ho! Class, huh? At Columbia? Let me tell you something, pal. I called the registrars office. I checked you out. They have no record of a Ray Thomas at that school! You liar!
That's uh, KL5-8383. Are you calling them soon because, they keep very strange hours.
All right. Well, we'll see what happens to you.
Okay, Okay. Who do you think you're talking to? What are ya' you trying to make a joke, because it's not funny. I can tell you that.
You remember my cousin Rhisa? I'm gonna date her.
Someone's have to unhook the boat before it leaves...the place!
Peggy! (they all sit) His daughter Peggy. Peggy's coming over to serve.
Does Neil like to eat a big breakfast?
I know that's why I bought `em but they're not comfortable.
Hey, let's turn off the lights, get some real 'movie atmosphere.'
Missing his plane? Wasn't that a charter flight?
(after hesitating, resignedly) All right. (He sits down and smiles unconvincingly at her)
What are you like a sadist? No matter how bad somebody feels, you can make 'em feel worse. I bet you're rooting for a tumor. (pointing to her)
What? No dibs! I need this statue. Cmon, give it!
[as if the word were totally foreign] My `stub'?
I don't. Susan wants to have it out when Sally comes tomorrow.
She knew I didnt have a job, she knew I lived at home. Didnt seem to bother her. I think I could have married this woman.
Going backstage is the worst. Especially when they stink. You know that's a real problem.
Well I didnt do it for my mother.
What are we gonna tell Jerry about the car?
I dunno. I was just talking to the man and he walked out on me!
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. It's from that grapefruit that Jerry squirted at me.
And you really believe this guy doesn't want to have kids.
Kramer, Kramer's not here...I knew it. I knew it! I knew this would happen. (SCREAMING) Kramer! Kramer!
I told her I would have to think about it.
(entering Jerry's bathroom) Well, Hanke's moved on to Step Ten. He was spotted taking personal inventory.
(in his mind) I think that ginger ale at the coffee shop is just Coke and Sprite mixed together. How can I prove it? Ah! Can't, dammit. (knock at door. George goes to open it)
Nothing. Uh, I don't know. I gotta go.
(To himself) How am I gonna do this? I'm engaged to this woman? She doesn't even like me. Change the subject? Toilets were the subject. We don't even share the same interests.
Oh, no, Sir. Festivus is all too real. And.. I could prove it - if I had to.
Why is nice bad? What kind a of sick society we are living in, when nice is bad?
Well I'm sure you have secrets from me. I don't know anything about your cycles.
You can't just walk into a building and say " I wanna be a talk show host."
George.. (She doesn't seem to recognize him) George Costanza.
Well, I still think you shoulda told me.
So are you going to Todd's party this weekend?
I didn't get the special, but I'd also like the fresh fruit too.
All right, all right, one more time, one more time! What was the exact phrasing of the request?
I just don't like the idea that any time theres a dinner invitation there's this annoying little chore that goes along with it.
(Yelling out to the whole coach) Funny guy! (Points to Jerry) Right here!
Jerry, I can't. It's like saying to Pavorotti, "Teach me to sing like you."
He's older, completely covered in filth, no whistle, but I think it's him.
They don't need any water, so you don't have to keep taking them to the bathroom.
Get out of here. I didn't see any cameras there.
Hey uh, isn't Elaine supposed to meet us?
Hunh, You know, it's the damnedest thing. I went out the window again to, to get a cup of coffee...
(Shrugging it off) She'll be fine. I gotta go to the hospital to see her tonight.
And you know what else I've decided to do? I'm going to keep seeing the bald woman.
Don't worry, we'll find something for you. (Knock of Jerry's door)
So how long has it been in the basement?
You know, I used to love Paris. My uh, dead Fiance, Susan.. (opening wallet) In fact I. think I, I may have a picture of her..
You know, this is very nice, but I really could take a cab. Really.
So is it all over between you and... Marsha Mason?
Well, I didn't think anyone would play it.
(to Elaine) Right, alright. (to Jerry) Oh Jerry, do you have any apples?
Jerry! Oh, my God! What are you doing!?!
He's the guy we're the buying the chair for, remember? It was your suggestion.
Because, Jerry, it's a couple rule! We have to tell each other everything!
So you could call a woman for a date, ask her if she's free for Dinner and a flamenco?
Hi, how are you guys? Listen, does either one of you have like a mint or piece of gum or...
Yes! Yes. You know. She didn't know about Pasteurization. He didn't know anout Fumigation. But they made it work!
(smiling) Ho ho. Funny. Isn't he funny? Funny guy. Ha ha ha.
Alright, well why don't we smooth the head down to nothing, stick a pumpkin under its arm and change the nameplate to Ichabod Crane?
You see, this is what I do with women. I start out too strong, now I have to become real, that's when it all falls apart. What good is real? They don't want real, they want funny.
Oh, what's the point? When I like them, they don't like me, when they like me, I don't like them. Why can't I act with the ones I like the same way I do with the ones I don't like?
(coming back to the table from the bathroom) Oh uh. You ready?
Do you think it would be better if I did?
Yeah, fun. IQ tests are totally bogus. They prove nothing.
Jerry took the flyers off the car, I got the whole thing covered.
Well, it would be OK if Darryl was here.
Well, Jerry, I been thinkin'. I've gotten as far as I can go with George Costanza.
I'd go to prison as your accomplice. I'd have to wear that really heavy denim. Go to the cafeteria line with the guy who slops those mashed potatoes onto your plate. Go to the bathroom in front of hundreds of people.
(entering the apartment more fully) Oh. Oh, hi, hi. Hi. Nice to meet you. (peering at the table) What're you having, veal?
Oh well, gracias El Commandante, gracias. Muy muy.
You would think that, but either youre born with a sense of humor, or youre not. Its not going to change even if you go from the red sun of Krypton all the way to the yellow sun of the Earth.
I just can't believe at the way people are. What is it with humanity? What kind of a world do we live in?
I always look annoyed. Yeah, when you look annoyed all the time, people think that you're busy. Think about it... (acts annoyed for 3 seconds).
Thank you Mr.Farkus, thank you very much indeed sir.
Oh ah, I uh, will have that for you by after lunch.
(angrily)"WHY WEREN'T YOU MORE CAREFUL WITH YOUR DROOL!"
Can you believe he sold his glasses on the street?
Dad, you know what it takes to compete with Microsoft and IBM?
(standing up) I'm just gonna go to the bathroom.
Yes but then everything is all pulled down and it's jus.. Anyway. The damage, unfortunately, has marred an otherwise fine automobile, rendering it virtually undriveable.
(clears his throat) Im, uh, Im an architect.
Um, I don't uh, really think I can go.
(Reading the card from Whatley) "This holiday season a donation has been made in your name to the Children's Alliance."?
Nah, I guess I should really get moving on this, huh? I'm gonna go. (Opens the door, letting Newman in. Leaves)
Sweet guy (Receives the phone from Beth, Starts to talk to Jerry) Hello
I didn't know you were such a Bette Midler fan.
I'm sure he'll be back in a second.
Where did I get the coffee? Where do think I got the coffee, at the grocery store. (small laugh)
Uh, excuse me. (stopping them from rehearsing) Excuse me. (he walks to the guy's in charge of yelling "take #!") This--This is not right. May I? (the guy looks at George with a bothered face. George then walks up to Tom and takes him away from Jerry and Michael to talk to him in private)(to Tom) You see, you're going "They fooled *me* Jerry!" (George shakes his head with disapproval) You wanna hit 'fooled' more "They *fooled* me Jerry!". You see the difference?
(Leaving) I'll store these over at Kramer's apartment.
(Standing up) I just got here, Ma! I'd like to spend a little time with you.
Eh, they're trying to pick out a new couch - you don't want to know. (Remembering the watching Van Buren Boys) Give me your wallet, or I'll spill your guts right here on the street!
Forget about smelling the car. Smell the valet. Go to the source...
What is this? Did you ever get the feeling like you've had a haircut but you didn't have one? I'm all itchy back here.
Um, excuse me, I - I think you forgot my bread.
(he drops a paper airplane he was holding) Mr. Wilhelm!
Do you uh feel the way you feel after the Risotto?
I cant call her now. Its too soon. Im planning a Wednesday call.
You know, I'm sorry, I...I hate to be one of those people, but we're right in the middle of this thing...I can't hear.
I guess she did. He's gone, now I'm the man.
You know, it was really wrong of you to back out on that deal.
And she'll still see it, you're not stopping her from seeing it.
I just remembered, th-th-there's this Chinese restaurant out near Yankee Stadium, that puts flyers on all the cars.
Come on, lets not stand here too long, we might run in to her.
Then of course with evolution, the octopus lost the nostrils and took on the more familiar look that we know today.
Wa, I'm not getting out of this cab
Do you know the last time I wore this thing? Six years ago, when I made that toast at Bobby Leighton's wedding.
I am never saying 'I love you' again unless they say it first.
(shouted after Elaine) You know, I got nothing outta this!
(checking his watch) Hey, let's get the check, she's taking the bandages off at four o'clock.
The woman she's "lesbianing" with? Susan told me she's *never* been with a guy.
The cashier is at lunch - which is where Id like to be.
Hey, don't embarrass me today. I got some friends in the stands. (George makes a swinging motion with an imaginary bat and pulls something in his back.)
Oh what's the difference? We'll all be dead eventually.
Alright, I'll tell you what you do. You call her back and give her the "it's me", heh? Pull the old switcheroo.
Ade, I have to tell you, I, I have never met anybody so ... efficient.
Do you believe this? We're fighting. We're fighting.
(PULLING OUT ESTIMATE OUT OF HIS POCKET) Well, profit. I think you'll see from the estimate that I'm not really profiting that much. They might be a little high, but..
Yeah, two for the 715 of Novaj pravas (?). What you're wearing the green sweater?
That?s not the issue, we're friends, if I?ve got to be uncomfortable, you've got to be uncomfortable too!
So now, the father is screaming at me, he's demanding that I pay for the boom box. Finally, I gave them a fake address and got the hell out of there.
Yes, yes! The punishment should fit the crime.
Have to give him time on this hour.
I'm gonna go with you. I gotta get a new suit. I got a second interview with MacKenzie, and I think I'm really close. They're all taking me out to lunch on Friday.
I was just blowin' off a little steam. So what?
All right, I want you to do me a favor.
(Pointing to them) Office Christmas gift. I tell you, this Human Fund is a gold mine!
(tasting the wine) Excellent. Like I really know what I'm talking about.
Wait a second. (George gets up and heads for the statue in Kramers hands.) I cant believe this! Let me see this.
Well, I guess these would be out of the question. (pulls out two pudding skins in plastic bags.)
Yeah, he once bumped into reverend Yung Sun Moon.
(playing with toys) Ahhhh, Yes! Touch down! Your turn, Jerry. (hands Jerry the Mattel Football. George starts playing with the Etch-a-sketch.)
Come on. Come on. Come on. Yeah. Yeah. (grunting)
No one's putting a gun to your head. Do I, uh, scare you?
That's a tough minute. It's like waiting in the shower for the conditioner to work.
All right. Don't change me. Susan. Don't change me. Ya know there are a lot of woman that would love to be in your position right now.
I...was trying to lead the way. We needed a leader! Someone to lead the way to safety.
I'll tell you what I'd like to do. I'd like to replace that rye.
Yeah, yeah. Speaking of crazy, did you hear about Lloyd Braun?
Yeah, hell be looking at us like hes backstage at a puppet show.
I can't believe they actually found your stolen car.
Well, I think we need more special days at the stadium, you know? Like, uh...Joe Pepitone Day. Or, uh...Jon Voight Day.
Oh, it's a bad day. Uh, you got everyone in your house, you're thinkin', "These are my friends?!"
If you're in some situation where some fast cash will save your life, I'll give you the code.
Come on! No doctor would put that on his car.
I'm sure we're all aware of the flaws and biases of standardized tests..
We, uh, we go on foot from here.
You should've seen her face. It was the exact same look my father gave me when I told him I wanted to be a ventriloquist.
Let me tell you who did, uh, buy it...um we pitched this story to Russell Dalrymple, the president of NBC, and he ate it up with a spoon.
(cheerful) Alright, there you go. She's gonna get the jacket back. (claps hands) So, let's go get some coffee, huh?
He's extremely Murphy. He's Murphy to a fault.
Yeah, when the season starts. Right now, I sit around pretending that I'm busy.
So let's say in her mind she witnessed a pick. Okay, so then what?
I've had bedroom naked, I've had walk-to-the-bathroom naked... I have never had living-room naked.
The plane's been re-routed *back* to Kennedy. We've got 45 minutes.
What's the difference you just read it and mail it right back. These we'll do.
Yeah, yeah. I see the irony. All right. What about this? What if I can find some way to break up with her so that she'll still like me and it doesn't affect the deal.
You remember the woman on the horse? She wanted my spot.
I think that's what the back of closets are for.
I'm at the health club and while I'm in the pool, some guy walks off with my glasses. Who steals prescription glasses?
(Apprehensively) Um. I just realized. Ya' never gave me back the change from the tolls.
Well, wait a little while, Ma. What's the difference?
Excuse me. Am I talking to you, Pinhead? Am I?!
I dont know where the nurse is. Sweetheart why dont you get a nurse for mommy?  Anyway I was just curious. Remember the other day you were saying something about my trip.
Well, I was 14 years old. I was in my friends bathroom. His mother's brassieres were hanging on the shower rod and I picked it up, studied it. I thought, I like this. I didn't know what way or what level, but I knew I wanted to be around brassieres.
What do you mean you didn't think I wasn't gonna use them?!
Well, at least, I'm not carrying a purse.
You know I still don't know how you can call lunch with me a business expense.
No-no-no, Kramer. Kramer! Kramer! You *cannot* abandon people in the middle of an airport pickup! It's a binding social contract. We... we must go forward... not back.
Oh, there's a soup stand, Kramer's been going there.
What is this 'saving movies' thing? Something's playing, you go.
(annoyed) Not a peep. They just cleaned the carpets and left. Call themselves a cult!
Anyway, so he gave me his spare keys, now he wants to have my keys, so I need mine back from you.
(Eating a sandwich) Oh, like you really know busboys.
Yeah. Hey, let ask you something. Is it just me, or - or do you find it unbearable to be around Jerry and that girl?
What are you doing here? I thought you said you hated Isabella's?
(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o. (Hes sitting on the floor in his Play Now office).
(to Jerry) Whos going to play left field?
Did you ever see her lose her temper. I was once late cause I bought a Panama hat -- she grabbed it by the brim, pulled it down so hard my head came right through the top of it.
And, Ill have a club soda with no ice.
Alright, now the play is tomorrow night. So do you want to have dinner first, or do you just want to meet at the theatre?
Ive had a lot of other paranormal stuff happen to me.
Hunh, pph (raises hands slightly, in amazement) How was it?
Anyway, again, I'm sorry about throwing you out of the car.
I didn't burn it down - Kramer did!
What? The guy asked you to HELP HIM MOVE? Wow.
What did you go out with me for?! Just to dump chocolate on my shirt and then just dump me altogether?! I don't deserve that kind of treatment! What, you don't have the common courtesy to return my calls?! To apologize! You think I'm some sort of a loser, that likes to be abused and ignored?! Who's shirt can be ruined without financial restitution?! Some sort of a masochist who enjoys being humiliated? You think you can avoid me like I have some sort of disease?! You have the disease! You have the disease! You may be beautiful and rich and physically .. just .. unbelievable, but you sicken me! You disgust me! You and everyone like you!
Anyway, as I was lying in the puddle, I-I think I may have found a way for us to get Bonds and Griffey, and we wouldn't have to give up that much.
(he thinks) I think the hats. The hat conveys that solemn religious look you want in a faith. Very pious.
I probably didn't hear it on the way over because of the street noise. (he panics) This is no good! I got to meet these guys from MacKenzie for lunch in half an hour!
You told her? How could you tell her? I told you not to say anything.
You know, you're nuts with these sponges. George is gettin' frustrated!
In every situation. No matter how silly I look. (Tastes his Clams Casino) Hm.. tastes a little funky.
I like, uh...(mutters something unintelligible under his breath.)
Carrie, could you do me a favour? Could you not mention this to your mother?
I know what you're going through. Women. Who knows what they want?
You know, it's very impolite to tell secrets. Are you talking about me?
Let me just see it for a second.
No! I don't! Don't you even care? This is your company! It's your name on the outside of the building! Speaking of which, the 'R' fell off and all it says now is K-uger!
(still quiet) Think, a second. You know, your friend was talking about me and, you know...
The doc called and said the lab's backed up and now I'm not gonna get the results for another two days.
So, let me ask you. Do you think I could have done this?
(grabbing his jacket) Hey oo, I just remembered uh my parents really wanna have you guys over for dinner before you leave town. What about tonight?
So you thought she was good looking and figured this would be a good way to meet her.
Ah, see, Mister.. I didn't write that report. That, that's not mine.
(chuckling to himself) Housewarming gift. (swerving the car to go to the antique stand) All right, we're taking it up a notch!
All right, come on, come on, let's go. Six dollars.
Elaine, Elaine, Elaine, Elaine...(distant alarm sound which is getting louder.)
Well I think I'm better off going one-on-one.
Oh, uh, the cigars.. (Chuckles nervously) I'm, uh, suckin' 'em down. I'm puffing my brains out, yeah.
All righty, no reason for us to uh, raise our voices.
I'll call a plumber right now! (Goes for the phone.)
(not expecting the statue to be thrown) Dit.
Well, some of 'em look good. The ones that look good you don't even know about.
How could it still smell after all that?
You cant be serious. This is New York city. There must be eleven million decent hotel rooms! Whatta you need? A flag? (waving his handkerchief) This is the signal, Jerry, this is the signal!
You know what you oughta do. You should go to her office and heckle her.
Oh, no, no, no...you sit right here...I will get you a nice snack.
Would you like a Pepto-Bismol? I keep them in my wallet...! (Russell goes into the bathroom and shuts the door.) (To Jerry) Do you think he liked it? (From the bathroom, we hear Russell violently heaving his guts.)
I have nothing to say to anybody. I'm so uninteresting. I think I'm out of conversation.
You, uh, you like baseball? [picks up baseball from desk]
What's wrong? I'll tell you what's wrong. I just committed adultery!
Who cares about eyebrows? Is she sweet? I like sweet. But not too sweet, you could throw up from that.
I'm sorry, umm he-here's your money back (gives Rudy the money back) I-I-I'll have the clothes.
Can I come upstairs, please? (Elaine pushes the button and lets George in.)
That damn delicatessen that - that is last time they screw up one of my orders.
You see? Now that is a handsome man. (Elaine and Jerry look right at George) Oh please.
For that rent, shed take a bath in the toilet tank if she had to.
(surprised) So, I'm Neil? How did I do that?
I'm George. George Costanza, you live around here?
Yeah, you gotta do it classy (wipes his mouth to his sweater.)
(doing the voice) Im slippery as an eel
The whole time that I was growing up, all I ever heard from my mother was 'Why can't you be more like that Lloyd Braun?'
(Interrupting) Anyway, I just wanted to let you know I'm really sorry that happened, and if I can help out in any way, I'll certainly be glad to do that. (Pause) Well, I guess that's about it.
Well, there's going to be a lot of dentists there.
You paying my hotel and airfare to Miami?
I got greedy. Flew too close to the sun on wings of pastrami.
I might tell her that I love her. I came this close last night, then I just chickened out.
Wait a minute? He's picking up the van tonight? This is perfect. I'll drive Rhisa to someplace romantic. Then when my father slides the door open, I'm in the van kissing his brother's daughter.
I'll fight ya! Not the face! Not the face! (The struggle continues.)
I can never get the package open in time.
So, Im thinking, as shes saying this, Im thinking great, the relationships over. But the egg salads on the way. So now I have a decision Do I walk or do I eat?
Pay phone in L.A., look it's a miracle.
I spilled some Chardonnay. So, what did you get?
I dont understand why you spend time with this guy.
(gleeful) Hehee. W..we could be like the Gatsbys. Didn't they always like, you know, a bunch of people around, and they were all best friends?
I can't go out there, he knows we're friends.
I doubt it. You know what he's doing now? He's putting a pool table in my old bedroom.
Hey! Great plane! Thanks a lot. Piece of junk. You know you almost got us killed!
(Standing up, still waking up) Alright, you know what we should do? We should go to the movies. Get away from this script for a while..
That condom killed me. Why do they have to make the wrappers on those things so hard to open?
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm terribly sorry.. (Bends down, and starts picking up her things)
If we could just harness this power and use it for our own personal gain, there'd be no stopping us.
You know, I have to tell you something. You couldn't get me on a plane right now. I get those FAA reports directly. My uncle sends them to me, he used to be a pilot, so. Big investigation in the, uh, what's the word there, uh, offing. It's in the offing. But, you know, you shouldn't let that stop you from going. You could go. I don't mind.
No wait, you can't just leave me here! Will I see you again?
Tuesday? I can't do it Tuesday. Steinbrenner needs me to run---
Fitted Hat Day! That's what you asked Steinbrenner for?
(waving) How can I not think about it? Look at the size of this thing.
What could I do?! We fooled around and went to a movie!
So, you know, she calls and says she wants to go out with you tomorrow night? God bless! Devil you!
Siege mentality, Jerry. They really want me out of here. Theyve downgraded me to some sort of a bunker. Im like Hitlers last days here.
No no, I never said I was a good driver, I said I was a good parker.
uh Tony? there's not gonna be too many sandwiches
Parking in a handicap spot. Right in the middle of his United Volunteers meeting. When he got back, he chased after me with a baseball bat.
I gave. I gave everything I could Mrs. Sokol. but nothing was good enough for her.
Well, I can't walk anywhere now. I'm just gonna be wishing there were walkways. (seeing Elaine removing her shoe) What are you doing?
(clipping on shades) Ha.. She'll have to find me first. (leaving)
What? I'm not eating bread now. I'm off bread.
I-I don't get these birds! They're breaking the deal. It-it's like the pigeons decided to ignore me!
(Scoffs) ARe you kidding? Lincoln Center. Alice Tully Hall, the Met. Magnificent facilities.
I am in and out of my personnel file at work all the time.
Yeah, I grabbed it on the way out, I don't want my mother reading it.
That doesn't explain the lipstick on the dashboard?
(Angered) Fine. I'll ask you again when you're rested.
Exactly! You know how they get animals to reproduce in captivity? They just put them in the same cage.
I was, I had to leave. She lit some vanilla incenses. The smell drove me nuts, all I could think about was food, I had to get out of there. We need some pudding here! Pudding!
Festivus, Sir. And, uh, I was afraid that I would be persecuted for my beliefs. They drove my family out of Bayside, Sir!
Every woman on the face of the earth has complete control of my life. And yet, I want them all.. is that irony?
Alright, what's the difference. What are we gonna do now? He won't take our calls, we can't get into his office...
You see, you see? I see things as they are and I say, 'no!' Uh, wait, you see things as they are not and you s- Wait, uh, you see things, do you see things as they are? What do you say when you see things?
Now, if this mechanic guy, was, in fact, eating a 5th Avenue bar, as he claims, wouldnt you agree he would have no problem picking one out from a candy line-up?
That's what she says. I say, listen. It was an old cat. It died of natural causes. So get this, now she tells me that I gotta buy her a brand new cat. I say listen, honey. First of all, it was a pretty old cat. I'm not gonna buy you a brand new cat to replace an old dying cat. And second of all, I go out to the garbage, I find you a new cat in fifteen seconds. I say, you show me an autopsy report that says this cat died of starvation, I spring for a new cat. So she says something to me, like, uh, I dunno, get the hell out of here, and she breaks up with me. Now don't you think that would be a great case on L.A. Law?
She said she liked me. No kiddin' she said that?
Yes, sure, surely was. Yeah, I'll remember that day. Well I'll never forget it because that was the day that I uh, lost my virginity to Miss. Stafford, the uh, voluptuous home room teacher.
Oh, hello, it's you! (angry) Listen lady, I got six minutes left on that meter, and I'm not budging til you admit you stole my twenty dollars. (smug) Huh-hu-hur, you're not so tough when you're not on your horse, are you Ruthie?
So, I broke up with Maura. It's done. I'm out.
No, he doesn't know O'Brien, if he knew O'Brien he wouldn't have a sign. Let's just do it.
Ohooo what are we going to do? I'm shaking! I'm shaking!
Alright, this is what ya gotta do I need ya to go out to the parking lot at Yankee Stadium, take the flyers off my car.
Well, I didn't really tell Susan about it, and she doesn't really have anything else to do.
I said, Listen Marlene, and then the next thing I know, Im in the middle of it. And theres this voice inside of me going, Youre doing it! Youre doing it! And then she started to cry, and I weakened a bit. I almost relented, but the voice, Jerry, the voice said, Keep going, keep going. Youre almost out! Its like I was making a prison break, you know, and Im heading for the wall, and I trip and I twist my ankle, and they throw the light on you, you know. So, somehow I get though the crying and I keep running. Then the cursing started. Shes firing at me from the guard tower. Son of a bang! Son of a boom! I get to the top of the wall  the front door. I opened it up, Im one foot away, I took one last look around the penitentiary, and I jumped!
Oh no no no no - we have to be in California next week. We're starting a TV show.
Well do you want me to take it off?
You know what, I'll just uh, I'll just look around for a little while. (moving to come round the counter) I'll just browse around.
Hey, you know, we haven't brought the Elaine character into the show yet. Umm, We should try and get her into this scene.
So what have you been doing with yourself?
Whatever!!. . . . Oh oh oh this is unbelievable. This is better than my bed at home.
So I tell Alec that I have to go to Paris for an undetermined amount of time. Then all I have to do is buy some post cards and have your parents mail them from Paris.
You have no idea how refreshing that is.
What happens to charter tickets when you don't use em?
I feel terrible, I can't be responsible for breaking up a marriage. Oh no (starting moving for the door, Elaine begins to stop him)
'Just listen to the music of the traffic, in the city. Linger on the sidewalk, where the neon lights are pretty.' Where the neon lights are pretty. The Broadway area?
Mmm, no. Boy, it really didn't come out too well, did it?
I tell you something. I wish there were pig-men. You get a few of these pig-men walking around suddenly I'm looking a whole lot better. Then if somebody wants to fix me up at least they could say, "Hey he's no pig-man!"
Oh, of course. (motioning Estelle to enter) Of course.
Elaine, this pilot...it doesn't matter to me, it's not me I'm concerned about...it's my mother. I've been over to the hospital to see her...
Wait a minute. I must have been winking down at the office. That's why Mr. Wilhelm was acting so mysteriouso.
If youre a spirit, and you can travel to other dimensions and galaxies, and find out the mysteries of the universe, you think shes gonna wanna hang around Drexlers funeral home on Ocean Parkway?
Yes, you know. Deal with it .We have to deal with the doubt, Susan The DOUBT!! Must be dealt with.
Oh, so now I have to buy this whole chair by myself?
Oh, this isn't even B.O.! This is *beyond* B.O.! It's *B*.B.O.!
No! I am not going to see a psychiatrist!
You're an alcoholic! You have to apologize. Step Nine! Step Nine.
Yes, well, I sat down with Mr. Steinbrenner. I told him you have been doing great work. I said that you deserved a raise, and if you didnt get it, that I, was leaving. (motions with both arms in a circular motion to his right)
All right, I gotta make a call. Everybody out, come on.
(Standing in the doorway) I'm fine with it! Fi-hi-hi-hine I say! (Leaves)
I can't believe this! What was wrong with it? What didn't you like about it?
He did it right as he said "her unfortunate accident."
I really can not comprehend how stupid people could be sometimes. Can you comprehend it?
This week. My father got a deal from a friend of his. It's Gore-Tex. You know about Gore-Tex?
Well, I like a rolling writer. They're very smooth.
Why does it always seem like I'm the only one working at this break-up?
I'm against all "it's me"s. So self-absorbed and egotistical, it's like those hip musicians with their complicated shoes!
You just checked your watch. Are you thinking of bailing on him?
More wine and turkey? (Pours Celia more wine)
Did you see that? The guy's walking away. What is wrong with you? That was a three hundred dollar profit.
You see I disagree. I'd rather be dating the blind. You know you could let the house go. You could let yourself go. A good looking blind woman doesn't even know you're not good enough for her.
I'll tell you something, if I'd own a company, my employees would love me. They'd have huge pictures of me up on the walls and in their home, like Lenin.
That's okay. That's good. You think Louie Pasteur and his wife had anything in common? He was in the fields all day with the cows, you know with the milk, examining the milk, delving into milk, consummed with milk. Pasteurization, Homogenization, She was in the kitchen killing cockroaches with a boot on each hand.
I wanna know what I did to this woman.
"Hey you know , I felt we had like a synergy out there,you know, like we were really helping each other."
No, I know I don't have to, I want to.
(astounded) What? So, this is still not over?
(grateful, relieved) Thank you! I'm gonna make you both so happy!
(Letting his conscious get the best of him) I wonder how Susan's father's going to react to this. Alright, what- what's the worst he could do? So you burn a cabin down..
(bursting out of the bathroom, fumbling with his fly) Button fly! Why do they put buttons on a fly? It takes ten minutes to get these things open!
But it's not a photograph, I need a photograph!
Well, of course they're trying to screw you. What do you think? That's what they do. They can make up anything. Nobody knows. "By the way, you need a new Johnson rod in there." "Oh, a Johnson rod. Yeah, well, you better put one of those on."
Does the heater even work in this car?
(Eating) Oh yeah. These are fantastic, fantastic. (To server) You know, I'd love to get a jump on the next batch, where do you come out? (Server leaves) (To Anna) She's been ignoring this section all night. Quesadilla?
Right! And these pigeons broke the deal. I will not accept the blame for this!
So what, what is so bad about that?
I have never seen a Mohel like that.
*I* think that *you* think that a certain *something* is not all that it could be, when in fact it is is all that it *should* be, and *more*!
(positive) Yes. From endorsing checks for the Super Terrific Happy Hour. (laughs)
(gleeful, to Estelle) You did?! That's Goood! That's very good! I'm very glad to hear that.
I'm the one he wants! He's coming to settle the score.
Neeson? How are you comparing Liam Neeson with Jon Voight? Jerry, we're talking about Joe Buck. If you can play Joe Buck, Oskar Schindler's a cake walk. (Opens the car door for Jerry, Jerry's about to get in.)
Maura. (starts acting dramatically, looking from Maura to Loretta and back again) Oh, my God! What are you doing here?!
Hey, I'm sorry, you had your buffer zone for many years. It's my turn to live, baby.
Alright, let's see, let's see. What else. What else. Oh yeah, what does she do?
What, are you crazy? I can't have a man touching me. Switch with me.
Yeah for two hours. She's nuts about you.
Ava was one of the reasons I used to like going to work, she was a friend. Now we sleep together and suddenly, I don't know how to talk to her. Every time I go to the bathroom I pass her desk. I have to plan little patter. I spend half my day writing. Then afterwards, I sit in my office and analyze how it went. If it was a good conversation, I don't go to the bathroom for the rest of the day. I see her laughing and talking with other people, they're all so loose and relaxed, I think, 'that used to be me. I want to go back there again.'
I think you're right. You gonna eat that?
Hey, thanks. I owe you a big one.
Well I was lost, I never saw the first one. By the way, you mind if I watch it here?
And how does the baldness fit into that plan?
You know, I can't remember the last time I called a woman without being nervous. I, usually, I'm pacing all over the room, I'm...
Well, it's less than twenty-four hours, so I guess I have to!
People always leave old things in their medicine cabinet.
I go in to use his private bathroom, everybody uses it, and then I get a memo - a memo - telling me to use the men's room in the hall. Well, (laughing) I mean we share it with Pace Electronics. It's disgusting!
And, it is all because of that car
Morgan? No. He's doing a great job. (winks)
All right. That's more like it. Thank you very much. (giving the sponsor the 'be strong' hand clench) By the way, my uncle was an alcoholic, so...
(smug) Ah, I guess I showed Neil who's Neil.
I don't think we should see each other anymore. You're great but I'm I'm riddled with personal problems.
People can drop change down here, Jerry. And theyre too lazy to pick it up.
(sitting) So, guess where Mr 'Ocean phoned' turned up? He's working for Firestone, in Akron, Ohio.
You're Murphy!! Look, let's just jump out of the car.
All right, look--wait--wait--Krama--wait, wait a minute, you are not. You are not goin' in. Ah-ahhh!
Yes, well you see, the deceased landed on my car. The uh splat, as it were, actually occurred on the roof of my car. Now of course I can't help but feel that had it been a convertible this whole tragedy might have been averted but I've never been the kind of guy to buy a convertible, what with the baldness and everything.
Ill eh, Ill just have a bowl of chili.
What about the skin? I need a good cheek, I like a good cheek.
(frustrated) No. No, no, no. You're not helping me.
All right, I'll tell you what... why don't you go into the store and I'll wait in the car?
An' wait'll you see the dress that she's got. It's backless! Uh?! I'm finally gonna make a Great Entrance!
Yeah. (Jerry nodding) ... Oh, you think because of what I said about the manure. I wa, wa, was just saying how it takes a negative thing, and puts it on a positive spin on it.
(attempting sincerity) As much as I'd like to see the two of you living it up in a warm, tropical, setting, I, I would just miss you too much. (smiling) So, I've decided, I want you to stay.
No problem there. Conformity is an obsession with me.
Alright. I'll run it by a few people.
I, uh, just think it's a little unusual. Two people to sit on one side...and leave the other side empty.
I know, but antiques are very popular right now.
You don't want to suffer with this all weekend.
Ah! Some bald thing, a bald thing I dunno. It's nothing
Oh, nothin' much, . . . talkin'. . . . Oh, oh, oh, did I have an unbelievable idea today!
(adamant) It's smart. It's a smart line, and a smart crowd will appreciate it. (shouting) And, I'm not gonna dumb it down for some bonehead mass audience!
Hi (raises his left hand in a slight gesture to say hi)
(oozing fake sincerity) Well, as much as I enjoy all the good-natured ribbing, nothing really makes me happier than spending money on the people I care about.
Alright, well you know what'cha gotta do, you gotta go through her purse. Y'know, the-the credit cards, driver's license...
What big salad? I'm going to the coffee shop.
Dad, it's me. Hey, listen, I was at Fortunoff's the other day, and, you know what, you were right.
I'm really going to do something with these three months.
She knows there is nothing to talk about.
(???), we'll see you in a little while.
That's a shame. (Karen is shown singing off-key on the television.)
Oh, no. No. No. No. No. Nothing. I'm fine. Everything's fine. Fine. Just get a little nervous on the weekends, that's all. Could I, uh, could I get a glass of water?
I feel like I got a B12 shot. This is like a taste explosion!
Yeah. Thanks for, thanks for coming by fellas. Eh, got a set of keys, buried in the pothole.
It's like going to the bathroom in front of a lot of people and not caring.
Who do I like? I, like, uh, Art, Vandelay.
Yeah, like he was really gonna take your money.
Yeah, right. I'll just go up and say, "Hi, how ya' doing? Would you like a glass of white wine?" JERRY Before you got within twenty feet of this woman, she'd have her finger on the mace button. She's like an expensive car with one of those motion-sensor force field alarms. Any sudden movement in the area could set her off.
Years. When we were kids, they made it seem like it was right around the corner.
Uhm...Id like to ask you...ask you to analyze a hypothetical phone call, you know, from a female point of view.
Why? Why? 'Cause he's off his rocker! That's why.
(pause) Alright if you think it's too much they don't have to mail the postcards.
Yeah, my wife couldnt make it today. Shes got something with her mother... Who knows whats going on with her. Dont let any one kid you, its tough.
(grabs the phone quick) Got it, Got it,...Hello?
I don't know, I don't know, you'll think of something.
Oh, no, no...condoms are for single men. The day that we got engaged, I said goodbye to the condom forever.
(not happy delivering Elaine's lie) Well, he uh, he wants to uh, quit the exporting and uh, focus just on the importing. And it's a problem, because she thinks the exporting is as important as the importing.
Yeah. Got to invite The Drake. Listen hem...there's something that's been on my mind and we haven't really talked about it..I t's kind of important to me.
Coulda fixed me up with Marisa Tomei. She said I was just her type!
Elaine, of course I'm concerned. I'm payin' for those meals. It's like throwing money down the toilet.
Don't look around. Don't look around. That's what he wants.
You would not believe what just happened. I was waiting for you and this woman was sitting at the counter.
( rubbing his eye) Ow, Ow you squirted me.
You know, you know what's great about our relationship?...It's not about looks.
Oh, my god that's Saddam Hussein. The dictator.
I still don't see why I can't ask her about my arm.
In any other shoe, I lose two inches. I - I can't have a drop down. We were eye to eye, I can't go eye to chin!
No, I don't know. Maybe you haven't. You know, not everybody's seen a massage table.
And isn't it more fun using the urinal?
Yeah, drove away.. You know, I said 'Hello' to him. You know, he's - he's-
How are they gonna make that book into a movie?
(laughing) Have something else. Cmon, have a little dessert?
Do you feel funny? He didn't say anything.
(running out and away from the van) I knew it wasn't Berkowitz!
You know what I've come to realize? I'm not just bored. I genuinely dislike her.
I can't. I gotta make the weekly call to the folks.
She put them in her pocket book. She probably took them out there with her.
I don't think I've ever spoken to her.
Oh no no no, if you must know, I would rather be with her than go to the game.
I know who it was too. It was the guy who interviewed me. He was very threatened by me. Why else wouldn't he hire me? I could sell latex like that (snaps fingers).
Slippery Pete, Kramer tells me you are one hell of a rogue electrician. And shlomo, you're the best truck driver.
The second time I sent the noodles back, I tought she made a face...
Ohh yes, yes. Yes Jerry they were all over me. It was like Rocky 1, Hm. Diane came up to me, threw her arms around me
Kramer, this is perfect. I need you to go in there, pretend you're a doctor and check this guy for moles.
Heh heh heh hey, new suit (raises coffee cup as a salute / toast)
The rule is a minimum of two days.
Yeah, I never know what's going on there.
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas! (Co-worker gives a gift to George) Oh, Sandy! Here is a little something for you.. (hands her a card)
(delighted) Jerry? It was incredible! Models! As far as the eye could see!
I cant believe I said that. You know me, Im a vault.
Maybe she moved it up in the rotation.
Who's going to bomb you. An airline for all the stupid little peanut jokes.
Well, if I hear you correctly--and I think that I do--my advice to you is to finish your meal, pay your check, leave here, and never mention this to anyone again.
Hey! Uh--listen--did you get your--uh--boss's Knick ticket, for Kramer?
It's stuck on a piece of cloth here. I can't get the cloth out.
If youre having second thoughts, if you didnt want it, dont worry about it because uh, you know, I, I...I could take it, you know.
Oh, real good. (George makes a face like you stink) Any word from NBC?
No No I'm working on a system...Who was that?
Hey, so get this. I get a call this morning from one of the Mets front office guys. They wanna take me out to lunch.
How are you closer to him than me?
Dark and disturbed? His whole life revolves around Superman and cereal. I convinced him to act like that so that you would think I was funnier. That's how disturbed I am! If you want disturbed, that's disturbed. You can't find sickness like that anywhere, you think sickness like that grows on trees? Nobody is sicker than me, nobody. He's pretending, I'm the genuine article.
How are we gonna get out of here? We need a plan!
(worked up) I'm aware! I'm aware!! But this is Marisa Tomei, Elaine. An Oscar winner! How can I live the rest of my life, knowing I coulda been with Marisa Tomei? She said I was just her type! She loves short, stocky, balding funny men!
Ten minutes! Here, here, (Fishes a box of Tic-Tacs out of his coat pocket and tosses them to her) Have some Tic-Tacs.
Hey, Elaine. Maybe his girlfriend is Lois Loan.
(little worried) Coffee? (thinks) I can beat that. Move in with me.
So this Anna called me from out of the blue.
She's confiding in him about our dates. You always like the person you talk to about the date more than the date! It's just a matter of time till they realize, 'Hey, we could have sex.'
"Arrrrrrgh!! .. It's George.. Oh! Sports wholesaler. yeah. yeah. .. thanks for calling back. No , no , no still got the shoes, still got the shoes. Lots of them. This is.. beautiful athletic gear."
So, I guess I was lucky that I never tried that myself.
Oh, o.k., yeah. Where am I gonna park here...? (Pulls over.)
An apartment complex, the uh the Eiffel Towers. uumm Like I said uh you'll be getting a postcard uh in a few days and again I'm sorry.
No... (takes off his glasses and wipes his eyes with his sleeve)
And now for the trifecta. (Picks up a hand held TV and gets back under the covers.)
Hey could you do one other thing for me?
Why doesn't *he* pick you up after the operation. He's got the car with the bench seats that you like.
Well, this is a lovely apartment. Lovely! My kids are gonna go crazy. I, uh, I wonder if I could see the bathrooms. Preferably one with some paint thinner and, uh, some rags?
(very casual and raising his hand in the air) Yep. That's five!
I just don't think it's such a great idea for you to sit here.
I know. Don't you see. (emphatic) He was doing it to fool Lloyd Braun!
Yes. Me, too. I wanna be normal. Normal.
This is incredible! This is one of the greatest things I've ever done in my life! I'm gonna call my mother.
(taking it out of his jacket pocket) yeah I got some sandwiches.. I got tuna.. and salmon salad Tony because I know you don't like peanut butter
(Slowly shakes his head) My mother caught me.
Faking? What makes you think that I have time to see doctors, take X-rays, make appointments, when there's absolutely nothing wrong with me? What kind of a person would do a thing like that?
You think she would care about the red dot?
Yeah, sure, we met at Jerry Seinfeld's apartment. When you fumigated for fleas over there.
Or we don't even send the check and then when they call, we pretend we're the cleaning service. Heh heh. "Hello? I sorry, no here Kruger."
Come on 'Oh George, oh Geeeooorge!' Come on! Not that I don't appreciate the effort that was put into it.
Oxygen! I need some oxygen! This is major.
Wow. Uh, what do I have to do?
Wait a minute, Rinitze? Don't they have somme really cool suits in there?
And you! How many Twix does that make for you, today?! Like, 8 Twix?!
I can't believe I missed Kramer. You know he asked me to go with him to California.
You see (to Jerry). You see. You see what Im talking about. It's all just slipping away. And you're letting it happen. (exits -- slamming the door)
I know, I hate it too. I feel like an out of work porn star.
You know what I was just thinking -- she could really use a raise.
Because it's really a pretty good little story. Don't you think?
It's right in the explosion scene. So if you could just...leave me a little window. You know, my, uh, my aunt had a thing removed with a laser. All right, I don't want to interrupt your meal, so...
Well if Houdini couldn't do it, what chance do I have?
No, you just tell him ah, an old boyfriend has come back into your life.
Did I tell you I ran into her last week? Ho-ho, she looked great.
I can't believe it. He's going! He's fired!
Daphne. I have to tell you something, this is very difficult...
I take it off when I go to the, uh, y'know, to the "office".
It moved! It was imperceptible but I-I felt it.
'Maybe you know some little places to go, where they never close...'
Did you explain to her about the good naked and the bad naked?
(Needing to get away from his parents, he gets up) I need some air..
Nah. It's all right. Great! She had a good time.
Alright, how's this? We wait till we get to your street corner, we see Elaine and Kramer then we get out. They can't shoot us in the city.
Well so what's the problem, you just put some newspaper down.
Great! I ate the entire platter! Had to call in sick today.
Well, I'm sure at some point between the years 800 and 1200--somewhere--there were two women living together.
The *bank*? This is *found* money. I want to *parlay* it. I wanna make a big score!
(slightly worried) You know, I'm starting to get a little nervous about this lunch.
Oh yeah.. (Starts to open it) Sally called Susan - said you guys really hit it off.
I'm gonna go meet Danielle. (grabs his coat) There's a new Neil in town! (triumphant laughter) Hahaha!
(singing; imitating Tony Bennett) You know, Id go from nods to nothing...
(trying again with Glenda) I'm gonna count to three. If you don't give up the chair, the wig is coming off.
Here's the TV. I know you wanted to watch the Super Bowl. Do you at least have some towels we could sit on? It's, like, a four hour game.
What, what happened? Where's, where's all the stuff?
I know, I know. Listen, your stuff has to be done by now, why dont you just see if its dry?
The name's George Constanza. I'm starting work here today. I was wondering if you could tell me where my office is.
Well, at least we know the prosthetic squirrel hips work ... sorry bout the set.
What are you talking about, that's seventy-five bucks! I'm not working, I can't afford that.
Hey, grown-up. (they both chuckle, George notices Gwen enter the room) Oh my god, there she is. Go ahead, go ahead. (to the others) Let's go, let's go. All right what are they saying?
(in the threshold between the living room and the kitchen) The thing that bothers me the most, is the lying.
Seemingly. Seemingly, to the untrained eye, I can fully understand how you got that impression. What looked like pushing...what looked like knocking down...was a safety precaution! In a fire, you stay close to the ground, am I right? And when I ran out that door, I was not leaving anyone behind! Oh, quite the contrary! I risked my life making sure that exit was clear. Any other questions?
Why don't you call her agency. Maybe she's been out of town and she didn't get the calls.
Regardless. I had to walk around for the rest of the party in some cheap Metlife windbreaker. Now, it is payback time.
Look, we're not gonna be that long anyway... we have to get to the "party"!
(Turning back to Jerry, he takes the check back. He just now notices the shirt Jerry's wearing, and snickers, pointing) Nice shirt.. (Laughs, Jerry shrugs) What is this? Is this what you wore on the show?
(Breathing deeply) That's very dirty. (Jerry nods) That's absolutely filthy.
(to himself) A cane. I knew it. (to Neil) So, we meet at last. I admire your skills, Mr Peanut.
Well then...then you really have something to think about because.....you know if there's any doubt in your mind ....and.. and,, it doesn't even have to be a big doubt, you know even a tiny doubt, a DOT of a doubt.. and.....
WAIT ,WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!!!!.... Where was the tape recorder?
What's he going to do? That's exactly the point. Nobody knows what this guy is capable of! He fires people like it is a bodily function.
Hey, Mr Seinfeld. (shakes Morty's hand) Hey, Mrs Seinfeld. How are you?
Elaine, can I just explain something to you very privately here? Susan and I have been together many, many times now, and just between you and me, there's really no big surprises here, so...make-up sex is all that I have left.
(Muttering to himself as he walks to the bedroom) More stuff..
(eating a pickle) Well they're his tickets, he can do what he wants with them.
The show will be like a heart attack!
I just wanted to talk to him for a minute, but Ill come back.
??? KNOCK OFFS. I NOT GOING TO DO IT! AND YOU'RE GOING TO CALL STEINBRENNER BACK AND CANCEL THE WHOLE THING.
How can you call yourself a clown and not know who Bozo is?
This you are not going to believe. Al Netchie, that pimple. Tells Daphne, not get this 'Not to get involved with me.'
(frantic by now) SHUT UP,SHUT UP, SHUT UP,...(then leaves)
How much tip do you leave on $8.15?
Are you kidding me? [Elaine walks past the window glancing in] This is the best tool we have today of measuring a persons' intelligence.
Is there ever a good time to have your parents stay with you?
Now, fellas, fellas.. easy. You wouldn't want to beat up on one of your own.
Well, I didn't mean to hurt you kid.
Hey check this out. I go to pick up my pictures and she says " I hope you got that mustard stain out of your shirt."
I always get myself in this position. Can't be on time. Gotta rush.
Tell you what, I'll make a deal with you. I'll sell it to you right now for ten bucks.
Yeah, that's what I want-- triangles. Alright, I'm outta here. Have fun with what's-her-name.
So I spoke a little to your little friend Denise last night.
Hey, maybe I could bribe one of those women that hand out the towels in the powder room.
Well, uhm, I think I'd like to do it.
Aw right YES! GUM! Good enough I'll take it.
Anyway, I think the guy in the shower opposite saw me. He gave me a dirty look.
I'm sorry about that lock on the liquor cabinet. The combination musta just flown outta my head. It's a mental block.
(Laughs) Steven, nothing is higher than an architect.
Yes, it is exciting! All right, this is gonna be my new face.
Wait wait wait, what is she... (takes the milk can from Jerry and puts it on the table) What is she like?
How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria?
Im okay. Im fine. Im wonderful. I never felt better in my whole life.
So do I, but I wouldn't hang it on a wall.
You know I uh, spilled a yogurt smoothie in here two days ago. Hm, Can't smell anything, can ya?
By the way, how did Puddy get back in the picture?
Seemingly. Seemingly. But within that basic framework there are many subtle variations, only discernable to an acute observer, that reflect the many moods, the many shades, the many sides of George Costanza.
Well you missed a lovely little party that we had for Grace.
how did I know you were here? Something drew me here. This is phenomenal.
(worked up) I can't have a cup of coffee with a person?! I'm not allowed to have coffee?!
I-I guess it can't hurt him... People eat *pounds* of those things.
Uh, uh, yeah. Actually, the, uh, I-I bumped my elbow on a desk and uh injured something an.. now it sort of moves involuntarily.
Um, excuse me, have you see a guy with like a horse face, big teeth, and a, and a pointed nose?
You know it's a public phone, you're not supposed to just chit-chat.
Hey, Cosmo what happened to your mother last night. She hung me out to dry.
(on the answering machine) Jerry, it's George. Hey, hey are you all set for the weekend. This is going to be great. You're going to have a great time with Naomi.
I mean it's hard enough to meet a woman you dislike, much less like.
Oh, no no no -- We bought the wine here before, but now, you know we're bl-blocked in by some car double parked and we're just waiting for the guy to pull out.
It's not that easy. It's like "Beat The Clock," there's a lot of pressure there.
(to various people as he walks in) Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Hi nice to see you. How are you. Good morning. (to the secretary) Good morning.
Exactly, you know what I'm talking about, right?
(frustrated) Oh, look at this. There's no place to park around here. I don't even know why they sell cars in Manhattan.
I like this area. I could live out here.
Bender? He cant play left. He stinks. I just dont see what purpose is it gonna serve your going? I mean, you think dead peole care whos at their funeral? They dont even know theyre having a funeral. Its not like shes hanging out in the back going, I cant believe Jerry didnt show up.
(laughing) You think you're going to the other side with "Hi"? You're not going to make it.
(thinks for a second) I got used to it.
What kind of a shake does he have?
Well, not recently. I craved. I crave all the time, constant craving...but I haven't yearned.
Dogs, twists, a kind of fermented chicken drink.
Wait, wait, did you ever see him throw up?!
Well why don't you take off your hat and stay awhile.
Why is what I do is so important? Why must I be always the focal point of attention? Let me just be, let me live.
You can stuff your sorries in a sack, mister!
Well, I, I got the pilot of the Jerry show.
Never! It is a part of me. I will just return the chair, and it will be easy, because the receipt is in my good friend.
(using the phone) Watch how it's done. Oh, hello, Mr. Vandelay? Would you like to buy a computer? Oh, really? Two dozen?
One of the guys in my cell threw a piece of gum at him.
Oh, no, not just me, the whole organization. Especially Mr. Morgan.
I can tell you this. If I am not in front of my house at six-fifteen, when my parents get there, they will put me on an aggravation installment plan that will compound with interest for decades.
I'm family. I'm having sex with the cousin!
Of course hes been in touch with him. Hes left two messages. He just hasnt heard back yet, thats all.
You wanna see?! (pulling off the hat to reveal the bald pate) There! There it is! (turning to Newman) Alright, here! You wanna try on the hat?! Here! Try on the hat!
Well, it's not that. I just, you know, I thought that we were both uh...
Oh. Oh. Yeah, sure. Here. Uh, sit down. Uh, uh, cheese, there? (he grabs a suit jacket from the desk chair and puts it on)
(gasping) I think I swallowed a fly! I swallowed a fly! What do I do? (He turns to a coffee shop patron at the counter.) What can happen?!
Do you have something a little more... less expensive?
Wait a minute. This looks familiar. This reminds me of something. I can do this.
Well, he said it could be cancer, maybe you should get it checked out.
Pick up the phone, Elaine. Pick it up!
All right, I'll tell them my sister died. (Starts fake crying) My poor sister died. She was standing and then she was laughing and then they SHOT her! That's the kind of sick city that we're livin' in. They shoot you for laughing. I must go and comfort my poor family. Jerry, take me home so I can comfort my... my poor family.
You know, I think I'm a little bit scared of her. She's five-three, like a hundred pounds. I'm frightened to death of her.
What happened to Babs. She never showed up last night. The whole thing blew up in my face.
Alright, let's just examine the situation for a second. Who, in this situation, would be more likely to make a mistake? Me, who had access to my wallet, knew exactly what was in there? Or you--
This is a brand new jacket. Boy this really burns me up, ...
You know my driver's waiting, I really should get running. Good to see you guys again.
ho ho ho ho. You know I only got two weeks left of unemployment. I got to prove I've been looking for a job to get an extension
Well, I can see that. What do you have to do that for? Who cares about your pants size?
I cant stand doing laundry. Thats why I have forty pairs of underwear.
Who's Bozo? Bozo the Clown, that's who Bozo is. When I was a kid, Bozo the Clown was the clown, bar none.
Baah! There it is! You just said it! That's what I want! Now say it again, and tell it to me.
No-no-no, we all chipped in. We have the money.
(seeing Jerry's van shaking) What is that? That van's a-rockin'.
All right, uh, okay, I got it, um, Ill sing.
(stops Jerry realizing something) Hey hey hey hey hey hey.
Not me. Everything should be negotiable. (he picks up a container of fruit)
(To himself) So you're havin' the sex, next day you don't have to call. That's pretty good. (Back to Jerry) Go ahead.
I'm very nervous about this. I've never spoken to a mental patient before.
Who says you gotta have a story? Remember when we were waiting for, for that table in that Chinese restaurant that time? That could be a TV show.
Alright, now. What mood am I in, what mood am I in?
This is what my life has come to... Tryin to meet a mute.
You have to stand tough sir. That's why I had to hang up the phone.
She's playing a recital this week at the McBierney School. You wanna hear her play? I got two extra tickets, you and Elaine could go...
Now, because of that stupid rye bread, I gotta keep them all separated for the rest of my life.
Hey I'll get married if I have to. Al Netchie will think twice before he opens his mouth about me again.
(Concerned) Why're you doing this, Jerry? Is it your career? Things will pick up.
Well, it was a hell of a ride.
My dad was a cook during the Korean War. Something very bad happened, ever since you can't get him near a kitchen.
Hey, Jerry, what was the name of the exterminator who fumigated your apartment when you had fleas?
No, not nice. She's stickin' it to me.
They wanted to read a Truman Capote book.
I wanna bite into a big hunk of cheese, just bite into it like it's an apple.
Because ballpark food doesn't count as real food.
We got a soccer game in Chile. Anyway, the plane crashes. Who are you gonna eat to survive?
Tsst...'Course I have. Come on. My cousin's in a bubble. My friend Jeffrey's uh, sister, also ... bubble ... you know. I got a lot of bubble experience. Come on.
Hey, Jerry, remember Frogger? I used to be so into this game. Gettin' that frog across the street was my entire life.
Would you excuse us for a minute Tim boy, we're kind of in the middle of something.
Oh yeah yeah, don't you know they used pastrami in that movie 9? weeks? Remember the pastrami scene?
You didn't find it funny?! This is what I'm paying for?
Marisa Tomei! I, just spoke to Marisa Tomei! (sitting opposite Elaine) And I wasn't even that nervous.
I don't even like to sit next to a man on an airplane 'cause our knees might touch.
(to himself) That's what I'd like to know.
No, no, this is supposed to go to Joe Mayo's apartment.
Hey Elaine. (George hangs up his raincoat next to the door) Im telling you Jerry, having a secretary is incredible. (George claps hands) I don't know why I didnt have one before.
[pause] Would I like to come up? I would love to come up. I, I'm fighting not to. Fighting! Unfortunately I uh have to get an early start tomorrow. Gotta' get up and hit that pavement
All right. Shh! I gotta focus. I'm shifting into soup mode.
I can do six weeks standin' on my head. I'm a sexual camel. That's not the point. At least there was the possibility.
I had nothing to do wtih any of this! I met all her friends, I didnt want to meet them. I kept trying to avoid it. I knew it would only get me in deeper. But they were everywhere! They kept popping up all over the place. This is Nancy, this is Susan, this is Amy, this is my cousin, this is my brother, this is my father... Its like Im in quicksand.
All my life I've dreamed of sitting front row, behind the dugout!
Well, sure. They're Jewish, and you're a shiksa.
(holding a magazine cover) Mira Sorvino. Think she'd go out with me?
It's really not accurate. Nobody drinks from a water cooler any more - they use bottles.
All right. So, he caught me in a cleavage peek, so big deal. Who wouldn't look at his daughter's cleavage? She's got nice cleavage.
Yeah, what is he? Some sort of an instigator?
Sometimes at restaurants she talks to her food 'Ooh, Mr. Mashed Potatoes, you are sooo goood.'
I guess there are no small diseases, only small actors.
My whole life has been a complete waste of time, (chuckle)
(seeing his parents being intimate) Oh, my god!
Got it. (the waitress walks away) Did you just see what happened here?
Well, I'm the good boy again. Can you believe that?
Yeah, well...a little rough finding something good in your price-range. (to Jerry) But you, my friend, may be in luck.
You see, It's right here. It's all white...
Yes! I'm not giving him the satisfaction, it's my space.
Anyway there was all this tension. I asked her if she wanted to go out to dinner and she said "no, maybe we could get together for lunch." You know what that means.
I think I had some hard candy in there.
...So, anyway, if you think about it, manure is not really that bad a word. I mean, it's 'newer', which is good, and a 'ma' in front of it, which is also good. Ma-newer , right?
You were supposed to deliver my calzones. We had a deal!
Sure. You know, Rhisa. I've always found you... very attractive.
(To his girlfriend) Nina, you have to decide right now. Jerry or me?
Well, Jerry's car gets hit and the other driver doesn't have any insurance, so the judge
We have no need to speak. We communicate with deep soulful looks.
No, that's a fair question. It is, uhm... (nervous chuckle) Jerry, yeah. (to Cynthia) Jerry's a friend of mine. (to Russell) He uh, he gave it to me. Unbelievable how many addresses of people this guy has.
Wait a minute, wait, it's not that stupid.
. . . I'm a little scared of her.
I wonder if, ah, Susan ... (picks up the phone from the coffee table, then decides not to call) No. I better just go. (claps hands) heh. All right! See ya. (grabs his rain coat from the hook by the door and rushes out)
I never assisted in a birth before. Its really quite disgusting.
Me? You see what he did here, you see how he tried to sneak into my space?
(spotting possible salvation) You know what, I urge you to take it up with him. Go ahead, give him a call, he'll tell you what I'm doing here. (half to himself) Then you can tell me.
Uh, nothing, lets get going. Come on. (laughs) hu hu.
And I cancelled plans to go to the movies with them tonight.
That's insulting! Ted Danson makes eight hundred thousand dollars an episode.
But if you think about it...26 teams, 162 games a season, you'd think eventually an entire team would get wiped out.
... She's got it stashed away in there somewhere.
Thanks. Gee, you know, I thought you were mad at me.
(Losing it) I guess everyone here enjoys giving the old screwgie, huh?! Youre all doin a hell of a job! (Looks longingly at the Twix in the machine) Ho, ho. What I would do with you..
You met her a few weeks ago, but...?
Then I got off the phone right away.
The next morning, I woke up, and it was going like this. (moves his arm slowly) I can control it if I really concentrate. But otherwise, (arm moves) oh.
Still, I bet when they gave him a plane, it was a lot nicer than this one.
" I'll always be a winner and you'll always be a loser." This is what he said to me.
I'll make time, because Abby, I was once like you; wide-eyed, naive, I didn't know the first thing about a subject as fundamental as risk management.
No. Semi-daily. Four or five times a week.
Now I remember, as I jumped over the hole I heard a, like a jingling sound.
Yeah! like the big toe is like the captain of the toes, but sometimes the toe next to the big toe gets so big that there's like a power struggle and the second toe assumes control of the foot.
(hurriedly leaves Rudy's) They had plans, They had plans!
Yes, but I still don't feel right about letting you into Kramer's apartment without his permission.
So, what's happening with the TV show? You come up with anything?
All right You really want to know?...It all started when she told met hat...she was the voice on your tape recorder.
Oh, no, no, not at all. No, I have always felt that the most important thing in the world is spending time with family.
I'd argue if I could, Mrs. Enright. (exits) Here we go, all right.
I just thought of a great name for myself, if I ever become a porno actor.
The sea was angry that day my friends like an old man trying to send back soup in a deli!
Only if you buy. I gotta make a sale.
Maybe I'll go down to the track. Put it all on a horse...
She stole twenty dollars from me. (getting angry) Yeah, I might've gotten it back, but Lloyd Braun interfered!
That's why the world's in the shape it's in.
Wait, wait wait, not so fast. Jerry, you gotta take me to get this thing refinished.
Maybe she just wants to talk to me?
She might be leaving to work any minute.
Well Dad's been planning this for such a long time, he bought a new blanket, and he got tha...that game with foam paddles and the velcro ball. (laughs)
Look, I have my system. First I look for the dream spot right in front of the door, then I slowly expand out in concentric circles.
So we order lunch, and were talking. Finally, she blurts out how its not working.
You start flirting with him and I'll come by and, while you're keeping him busy, I'll slip it in his drink.
Susan B. Anthony** I think I'd have a problem with.
All Simons was able to find out is that hes in the hospital.
I won fifty bucks! Boy, this is great. Too bad Elaine's not here.
Aw c'mon. It's a fantastic name. It's a real original, nobody else is gonna have it and I absolutely love it.
It's all departures. I see nothing but departures. (to the woman beside him) Do you know where the arrivals are?
(Complaining) I can't read it. I need my glasses!
(Pleading) Please, please, they're gonna hit me! (Attempts to grab Helen's purse, she starts hitting George defensively, he backs off)
Oh!, so what. I'd rather she hate me and thought I was good looking....At least I can get somebody else. (scratching his chest) What is this? Why am I itching?
I know someone wholl do it. Shes good. Shes honest.
Well I guess that's because I wear boxer shorts.
(interrupts her) You know what. I don't think I'm going to be able to stay over tonight.
I'm stuck. Pull a little, just a second. Don't start the train! Don't start the train!!
So, she went out with you on a first date.. and it was her birthday?
You know, I could have actually gone to that.
(to Jerry) It's all white Jerry! It's all white!
The table, the stereo, the VCR, the velvet couch, where's the velvet?
horning on my rock climbing trip. It's just supposed to be me and Tony
I'm all for awkward pauses. Fix me up with her.. Wait a minute, Nina just saw me in my Timberlands! Now I have to wear them every time I see her.
He's got Marlon Brando's. I could go to Marlon Brando's house if I really wanted.
Yeah, it's me sir. It's been a harrowing few days. uuh,After the car accident, I-I crawled into a ditch, and managed to survive on, grubs and puddle water, until a kindly old gentleman picked me up.
Ah, I guess I should go up and apologize.
Hmm-hmm, not by a long shot. I'm calling up the Rosses and inviting them up to my non-existent place in the Hamptons. Then we'll see who blinks first.
I'll get him to see a real doctor. You just stay away from this.
You want to hear more? The master bedroom opens into the solarium.
I'm really serious. I think that's a good idea.
I told her. In the kitchen  which was risky cause its near all the knives. I started with the word Listen.
I cant do it. Ill, Ill keep her busy.
Oh, that's too bad. I kinda wanted to meet him, seeing as how we look so similar.
Mothers say things. My mother goes babbling on and on like a crazy person.
Behind the dugout, that's where we were sitting the other day.
I take an eye test; I flunk it, the next thing you know I am swinging to the sweet sounds of risk management.
Jerry, my vacation just started. I need a day or two to de-compress. Besides, I did plenty today.
(Rubbing his stomach) Ooh.. Something's not sitting right..
Yes, they are bold. Jerry, what do you think?
So, tell him you're concerned about it and he should see someone else.
Yeah, about ten, fifteen minutes. But I have to stop at a vegetable stand.
Listen Jerry. With all due respect, Bania's voice is the voice of a new generation. My generation.
(To Carl) Oh, by the way, order anything you want, it's all on me. Just do me a tiny favor pretend we're old friends. Oh my God! Mr. Morgan! What a coincidence, it's Mr. Morgan. Mr. Morgan, I want you to meet a dear old friend of mine, Carl.
So, I'm gonna steal another one, and then return it. That way, everything is even.
No, no. Forget it. I don't want it. Let's just get rid of it.
Of course. Your massage. (winks) Enjoy your massage. (winks)
Yeah, sure. I was showing a condo on 48th street. Besides, you think I wanna miss this? (chuckles)
I've done the march in. Best feeling in the world.
Yes, for a sales position. Latex salesman, the selling of latex, and latex related products. They just wouldn't give me a chance.
Look at these salesmen. The only thing these guys fear is the walk-out. No matter what they say, you say, "Ill walk out of here right now!"
Have you seen Jerry? (sitting beside Elaine) I told him two o'clock.
Ya and also I'm afraid that people in that state are finally going to tell me what they really think of me. You know they got nothing to lose what do they care?
By the way, you owe me seven fifty.
Wait, have you ever seen him throw up?!
You know, Ive been thinking. I cannot envision any circumstances in which Ill ever have the opportunity to have sex again. Hows it gonna happen? I just dont see how it could occur.
I can't believe what's happening here. She hasn't taken her hands off me all night. She was always friendly around the office, but that was it.
So you don't think she really has a boyfriend?
Yeah, well, she's trying to track you down.
I'm not gonna be nice. That's how I got the job.
(indicating the window) Kramer, it's, it's raining. They got the tarp on the field.
Alright, I'll tell you the truth. I'm not gay. My name's Buck Naked, I'm a porno actor.
You are gonna love this car. Even if you don't like Jon Voight.
(trying to laugh it off) Right. C'mon! I'm having an affair with Elaine?! If I was having an affair with Elaine, I wouldn't tell you I'm going to see Elaine. I would make up some other person to tell you I was gonna go see, and then I would go see Ela..Elaine.
(takes a bite) Oh, that's good. That's very good.
No, no, this wasn't moving on. I got the hook. I wish I could get a lesson in that.
And here's a roll that I think you may enjoy.
My tonsils? Yeah, when I was a kid.
See, I knew it. I knew this was gonna happen...
(Holding out his arms - giving praise) It's beautiful. Now, what do I say?
How do I know, maybe, you know, maybe she wanted to be polite.
You never run out, do you? (Jerry smiles.) Where's Kramer? Everything's finished here.
Hey! (to Elaine, who doesn't look too cheerful)
I'm not her boyfriend. I want to be her boyfriend.
(Showing Jerry up) Listen carefully. My mother has never laughed. Ever. Not a giggle, not a chuckle, not a tee-hee.. never went 'Ha!'
I know, I know and you know *why* they're moving there?
(Sheepishly to Elaine) I'll be right back. (Leaves)
All right. Let's go over it again, one more time.
(sitting) Newww tuxedo. For the Pinstripe Ball. Steinbrenner is throwing a huge party at Tavern on the Green, heh!
My father wears his sneakers in the pool! Sneakers!
...pianist. A *classical* pianist. She *plays* the piano. She's a *brilliant* woman. I-I-I sat in her living room... She played the *Waldstein Sonata*! The *Waldstein*!
You know, you could've just given me Neil's number. You..you didn't have to take me out to dinner.
Yes! 860,000. I can't believe it's still standing. No one has beaten me in like 10 years.
Ahoy! Mr. Eldridge. I understand you were on the Andrea Doria.
Oh, please ... ... four dollars is f...
(Heavily sarcastic. He's angered at Jerry) Good one. Very funny. You're very funny, Jerry. That's what I always tell people. (Yelling out) Jerry Seinfeld's a funny guy!
I never tasted a cough medicine I didn't love.
(to Elaine) Do you want us to go with you?
When are you going on your next date with her?
(excited) You're saying I stand to inherit three hundred thousand dollars, is that what you're saying?!
(singing) Master of the house/Doling out the charm/Ready with a handshake and an open palm/Tells a saucy talk/Loves to make a stir/Everyone appreciates a...
They refuse to put cucumber in the salad. I need cucumber.
The Rogue's Wallet. That's where he kept his card, his dirty little secret. Short, devious, balding. his name was Costanza. He killed my mother.
Divorce is very difficult. Especially on a kid.
Remember that New Year's party he threw a few years ago? He had that very drafty apartment, you know, I think on Ninth Avenue.
So you're telling me instead of them being happy to see me, they're going to be upset because I didn't bring anything. Ttst --You see what I'm saying?
Well, I told it to Susan before, and she didn't like it.
I had a little tiff with Bonnie about the roommate.
Demi (the "i" sounds like an "e")? I thought it was Demi?
You said you grabbed it outta there real fast, right?
Kramer, I can't help you. You're gonna have to get them some place else.
I told her I liked her. Why? Why did I tell her I like her? I have this sick compulsion to tell women how I feel. I like you I dont tell you.
Snoopy and Prickly Pete. Should I keep driving?
(singing)  Master of the house/Keeper of the inn... (Jerry re-enters the living room and modestly models his new jacket for George. George is impressed.) This is huge! When did this happen?
What kind of a sick impulse does that??
Just the last few innings of a double-header.
Yes! (both laugh) God, I've never felt so alive!
This is very exciting! You're on the Tonight Show, NBC, who else is on the show?
That was a hell of a thing when Spock died...
(Takes two oven mitts from his back pack) Alright, (puts them on) I gotta get going.
Split it. Pretty good. Talk about game six?
Because I kissed her in the meeting. Russell found out, he fired her over the phone. Finally, my stupidity pays off!
Look, I am under direct orders from Mr Wilhelm. So if you have a problem with that, maybe you should just take it up with him.
Oh, I find you so charming. You wuss.
(CONT'D) Excuse me...I really... What's happened is that my friend forgot where he parked and if you're not in a big hurry, we'd really appreciate it if...
But you didn't use a coaster, Jerry, you left a stain! (he runs to kitchen)
(Yelling out) It's my apartment, Eldridge! The Stalkholm may not have sunk ya, but I will! Ha, ha, ha!
Yeah. Steinbrenner wants everyone in the front office to give a lecture in their area of business expertise.
Wait a minute, wait a minute, do you think I?m comfortable here. I can't change, I?ve got no clothes here! You've got to go like that, I can?t go like this alone!
Then I asked her if she wanted a drink.
Give me the phone. (dials) Yea, Hi I would like to speak to Patrice. ... what? ... oh really? ... oh, ok, thank you, ... (hangs up)
I don't believe it, what did you say?
I wouldn't hear of it, Todd. It's none of my business. But you should try to find out everything you possibly can. In fact, I'll even stay all the way on the other side of the room just so there's no chance of me overhearing anything.
No no. That's not what I was trying to do.
(Defensively) He knows how to read. And he also knows finishing an entire book doesn't prove anything. And get this he's into architecture.
(Laughs slightly) A physician married to a salesman. (Chuckles) Well, I gotta tell you, Beth, you coulda done a lot better than him.
"Argh!!..Anyway...Jimmy couldn't be here today so he asked me to fill in for him, and I'm sure that you'll be impressed at what can be accomplished after only a few short days of training.....yeah!"
No, I don't know. How do I know the usual?
No, Kramer. I have to have this statue.
Im sorry, I dont see the big deal about being a matador. The bull charges, you move the cape, whats so hard?
Right. (Mumbles) Nastercoff.. What country is he from, again?
Make myself comfortable. What does that mean? Does she want me to take my clothes off? Is she taking her clothes off? What if I take my clothes off and she still has hers' on? Then I really look like an idiot. She could get offended and leave. So maybe I should leave them on, but what then if she takes her off? Then she'll feel humiliated. 'Make yourself comfortable'. I got this unbelievable woman and this 'comfortable'-thing can ruin me. I got it! I take my shoes off and sit on the bed. There, that's comfortable. She can't accuse me being unconvertible.
I would like to dip my bald head in oil and rub it all over your body. [No reaction] You don't understand! It's a miracle! You don't understand because you don't speak English!
What are you doing?...She had those nuts in her mouth, she just spit them out.
If she want's to continue to have a fibre of her being she'll be very careful (hitting each other)
Kramer, what the hell are you talking about?
It's not that I want to keep talking about it? just think that the subject should resolve itself based on its own momentum.
Well a lot of people consider me small and prestigious.
Well take a look. It might not even belong to her.
(Anyway,) on the left--exquisite marble! High ceilings. An' a flush, like a jet engine! (imitates sound) Ha ha!
I don't know. I don't wanna be one of those guys.
I tell ya, I am hooked on these books on tape.
What do think I tell Jerry everything? It's not like he's my wife.
Oh, my God.. (Buries his face into his hands)
You're luscious. You're ravishing. I would give up red meat just to get a glimpse of you in a bra. Im terribly sorry. (both George and the attractive female applicant stand up as George reaches across the desk and shakes her hand for coming in)
No, that's not enough BTUs for my living room...That was a complete waste of time.
We had an incredible phone conversation. We talked for like twenty minutes. I threw away my notes in the middle of the call. You know, I thought she had a great voice timbre. Is it timbre or tamber?
Then why don't you try and get him another job?
Salsa is now the number one condiment in America.
Who would Want to. She tried to end it with me, Jerry.
No keys. And I been calling the city all day. Course there's not really a number to call if you wanna make a pothole.
(handing over a bill) Can I get a pack of gum, please?
They, uh... said you were with some guy who was wearing a cape?...
Because you're a gymnastics teacher. It's only natural.
I tought I picked up a little something. I'm very good at this. Did you pick up anything?
Wait, wait a minute...they don't have them anymore. I just found out, they just took them off the market.
Wait a second. 'Little places to go, where they never close.' What's a little place that never closes?
She's stickin' it to me that she makes more money than me.
Well, that pear shaped loser was me! And I was in that photo, until I broke in here, stole the photograph and airbrushed myself out of there!
Yeah. Yeah. It's the only way. Come on. What are you, kidding me?
You know, my arm feels a lot better. That Wendy really knows her stuff. (he writes out a cheque)
You've still got pretty good coverage. Once the enemy advances beyond this perimeter - (points at Kurt's head with a pen) - then you won't be Kurt anymore.
Know what? Ponce De Leon is sold out.
(Talking about his would-be apartment) You could fit 15 people in that bathroom..
Listen, listen, dont get worked up, cause youre gonna know the whole story the minute she steps off the plane.
Well, not really. After all, she did get together with George Peppard. I mean, Fred.
Oh, you might want to stick around Jerry. Mr. Thomassoulo picked the wrong man to hire because he was fake handicapped.
Yes. She's got great skin - a rosy glow..
(whispering) Glenda, can I ask you a favor? Can I have this seat?
It's break up by association. Besides, she's mad at me anyway because of my birthday present.
I'm just asking, all they have to do is say no.
All right. There's nothing to be worried about. She's just a little annoyed right now. Tomorrow I'll personally go over there. I'll apologize. I'll get the papers. Don't worry. Don't worry. (exits)
Ah, and I got a date with the sales woman. She's got a little Marisa Tomei thing going on.
No Don't get the camera , we don't need the camera. Listen I know your skeptical , but I really believe in the Chinese.
Behind the dugout, are you kidding? How did you get them?
Well...I was in the locker room showering, and I...I had to go, so...
That's my whole afternoon! I was going to look for sneakers.
(to the woman) Boy, I have to get to a bathroom.
Are you looking deep down at the real person underneath?
(George, finger in the peanut butter jar) This is what I do.
Nah, the cable's out. What's with you? You look dead.
How's this for criticism? Um...you stink. How do like that criticism? You know what's funny to me? That diploma up on the wall. That is my idea of "com-med-dee"! You sitting here, telling people what to do.
No, I don't know who was doing that.
Yep. And it didn't take very long either.
Thats my candy line-up! Where are all my cards?! Theyre - theyre all on the floor!
(Getting up, he addresses Jerry) All right, remember no rust-proofing. Commit to nothing. If you have to speak - mumble.
Hid? I have no idea how this suit got misplaced. Nevertheless, I do believe I shall purchase it.
You could take the IQ test for me. I could pass it to you out a window. We could do it, she lives in the first floor.
What I said? I say stupid things all the time I can't go two minutes without saying stupid things.
Because I cant call a woman with other people in the room. Come on, lets go.
The Duty Free Shop? Duty Free is the biggest sucker deal in retail. Do you know how much duty is?
No, Can't be...For instance I remember when we first met, we had a great conversation.
I think things were going ok. We were having a nice conversation.
Yeah, yeah. You really cashed in on that favor pretty quick.
What are we supposed to do? What do you do on a situation like this? Should we call a lawyer, should we call the police?
(resolved) Why not. (determined) If she can't find me, she can't break up with me. And, if we're still goin' out, she has to gooo to the ballll.
(After looking in the bag) The pea pods? All you saved was the pea pods? (Kramer enters)
Do you see what this is turning in to? Do I need this. I have to get out of this thing.
Well it's a little strange. You going to start to talk like Elaine from now on?
I know, I know, thats what they said.
(Outraged) "That's all"?! That's everything! I don't know what all the rest of it is for anyway!
No, no that can happen. Ive, uh, Ive read about that in medical journals. Its a freak thing, but...
What was wrong with that sorry? It was a good sorry. Jerry, was that a good sorry?
Boy, I wish the flamenco was popular here.
See, I think people would talk about it at the coffee machines.
When are they gonna have the flying cars, already?
Im not going with him. I dont even know the guy. (to the teller) Look, they did this for me before.
(cocky laughter) Huh haha! (shouts) You're meat, Reilly! You just screwed yourself! (laughter) Ha ha!
Well, it's this little place with this little bathroom. It's like right there, you know, it's not even down a little hall or off in an alcove. You understand? There's no... buffer zone. So, we start to fool around, and it's the first time, and it's early in the going. And I begin to perceive this impending... intestinal requirement, whose needs are going to surpass by great lengths anything in the sexual realm. So I know I'm gonna have to stop. And as this is happening I'm thinking, even if I can somehow manage to momentarily... extricate myself from the proceedings and relieve this unstoppable force, I know that that bathroom is not gonna provide me with the privacy that I know I'm going to need...
Yes. You know the uh flood, and the uh lepers, and the commandments and all that.
Excuse me. I believe you just ate my Twix bar. It was dangling. And when you purchased your Twix bar, you got a little freebie, and you never bothered to ask why, or seek out its rightful owner.
You know, I think we really need to be in front of a television set. You take T.V. out of this relationship, it is *just* torture.
Yeah, it bothers me. Doesn't it bother you?
See? This looks right to you, doesn't it?
(hangs up the phone) That's my toaster. I got to go. Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh!
It was fantastic, Jerry. We wound up talking all night.
Susan! Jerry! Where are you? I know you're there! Answer me!
He can be pedantic. He can be pedantic.
I don't know, she said she had to pick up a friend of hers at the airport. It cost me a hundred dollars this ticket.
Okay, what about a nice frame? With a picture of another guy in it. Frame says I care for you, but if you wanna get serious, perhaps you'd be interested in someone like this.
Oh, you spoiled, spoiled man. Do you now how much mental energy I expend just trying to picture women naked?
(leaving) Yeah, Sure, sure ,,, I got to drop my car off at the new lot.
Thanks a lot. Ill give it back to you in a week.
What happened to the pact? We were both gonna change. We shook hands on a pact. Did you not shake my hand on it uh?
(Sarcastic) Yeah, performance artist. She's a real performer. A real trooper.
Stop it! It's nothing. It's a stupid holiday my father invented. It doesn't exist!
It's not my fault! I wasn't going to do anything until you got her all juiced up with your story about having the affair with the matador!
Listen uh, David, I, I, I want to apologize about that comment
Ah, would you take this picture away from me. Take it away and get it outta here. Let me just sign this and go.
Really? I never heard of a semi (the "i" sounds like an "e") tractor-trailer. (Jerry nods in agreement)
Kramer, listen to me. I'm never gonna have a child. If I lose this Frogger high score, that's it for me.
(to Kramer) Ah! You're just the man I'm looking for.
Well, that interests me very much Mr. Farkus.Very much indeed, sir.
Please give it to me. I love to help people. This is what I do. Come on. I'm going this way. (he takes the table from Jodi's hands and she has no choice but to follow him)
You got hookers turning tricks in my car. How's that for starters.
Jerry, I'm not suggesting getting rid of the girl. She's integral.
All right, shmoopies...what's it gonna be? Pick a theater.
All right. See you tomorrow. (George sighs, exits.)
I'll try some on and see how they look. It's just hair.
You know it's like you never see a really attractive woman getting a traffic ticket.
Maybe it's got something to do with that 42 in the corner .
My presence, in that office, can only hurt my chances.
I mean, she's beautiful, right? She's just my type. The dark hair, the full lips.
Why did you give him my ticket for?
All right, All right, all, right!!( gives the headphones to Kramer) How you gonna find out who this is?
I wanna get it back when we were the Gatsbys.
I know I was just telling them the story.
Wait a minute, call the car phone, see what happens.
Oh, sure. (Holds the box out as Susan takes out a few letters)
Well, losing a loved is, uh...I mean, forget about it. (Starts wolfing down the sandwiches.)
You know. (All three give him blank stares) I was alone..
Yeah, sure. (big smile) Then my father will have no place to sleep. (snaps fingers) He's gotta move out.
And you met her in an antique store! I don't know how you do it!
I guarantee you that Moses was a picker. You wander throughh the desert for forty years with that dry air. ... You telling me you're not going to have occasion to clean house a little bit.
I found it morose. Why dwell on these negative themes?
Oh you mean face down on her chest.
Well, they gave birth to me, and, yada yada...
No, I'm not. I would like to be, but I'm not. What am I gonna do? The book club meets in a few days.
Well, anything I can do to help, um...she's a wonderful girl. Very smart. Very eh...crafty.
I like history. Civil War. Maybe I could be a professor, or something.
(Holding up Kramer's book) According to this, it took.. 10 hours. It eased into the water like an old man into a nice warm bath - no offence. (Pause) So, uh, Clarence, how about abandoning this apartment, and letting me shove off in this beauty?
Yeah, You remember the, the little eh, bank book, there?
(tormented) Aw, shut up Jerry! Just shut up!
It's exciting, isn't it? She's gonna have a whole new face.
I'll leave when the guy comes in. I gotta tell you, I am loving this yada yada thing. You know, I can cross over my whole life story. (Picks up dental tool)
Hey, is it my imagination, or do really good looking women walk a lot faster than everybody else?
Its an incredible deal. I dont know why you dont come with me.
She tolerated the strawberries and the chocolate sauce, but eh, it's not a meal, you know? Food and sex, those are my two passions. It's only natural to combine them.
You can't do that, it's none of your business!
Oh, ok. Thank you. It was good talking to you.
Well, uh... come in, come, come in. (frantically clears the couch of newspapers and crumbs)
Yeah, I'll zip in, "How do you do?", zip out. She'll love me.
So let me ask you a question about the tip jar. I had a little thing with the calzone guy this week. I go to drop a buck in the tip jar and just as I am about to drop it in he looks the other way. And then when I am leaving he gives me this look think thanks for nothing. I mean if they don't notice it what's the point.
She said first row! Right behind the dugout!
Oh my God...You're in jail? (Celia nods.) That is so cool!
I think they really went for that Soda.
I just wanted to tell you that I really enjoyed Fair Game. I thought it was just brilliant.
This is not good. This is not good.
(pointedly to Elaine) Oh. Thanks very much for yesterday, by the way.
If I do it, will you buy a computer?
So, Marcy, you should've seen me in the hot tub yoday.
I- I'm pretty sure I left it eh, behind the cushion of the chair ... accidentally.
Whooo.. (To a waitress taking orders) Ooh.. French fries.
No come on, let me, let me. I smashed your car, it cost you over two thousand dollars,
Well, Jerry. There was a pretty good chance I was never gonna have sex again anyway.
(getting animated) Look I, I uh, I had nothing to do with this. It wasn't my decision. It was Jerry! Jerry told me no. I'm the creative guy. He handles the business end.
(Hangs up phone and pauses) this is great! He fired her! This is incredible, he fired her. I'm out, baby! I'm out!
What are you? Satan? I'm close to a job here. It's my second interview with them.
So you're buying the car back for your parents?
Thats exquisite. Listen, uh, if its not too much trouble, could you pass me that paper over there?
You don't know what that spot means to him. Once he gets it, he doesn't go out for weeks.
[trying to act as if he doesn't care one way or the other, but we know better] Either way.
I'll tell you what's insane the price that I could get you on a new desktop computer.
What, was that not politically correct? It's a legitimate question.
No. (dips the chip) You dip the way you want to dip...(bites the chip) I'll dip the way I want to dip. (dips the chip again.)
I gave her a twenty, she only gave me change for a ten.
Get a good night's sleep, alright fellas. (thumbs up) Big day tomorrow!
Now, each of you is here because you're the best at what you do.
(somewhat annoyed) I suppose you could be an architect.
Maybe the baby would like to see my spot. A positive, uplifting message to start his life out with. Huh, You can still get a great space in this city - if you apply yourself.
Yes, I am familiar with this syndrome -- she's a two-face.
Oh, sure. Of course. (looks for place to set down flowers) Um, uh, could you hold these? For just a second, just a second. (grabs newspapers from trash bin, begins wiping windshield) Here you go, now don't worry about a thing. It's gonna be fine. Here we go. Look at this shine.
I'm unbelievable at spelling last names. Give me a last name.
I like sports. I could do something in sports.
Fine. Excellent. Could you do me a favor? Could you not tuck the blankets in? 'Cause I can't sleep all tucked in.
I've been to a few of em. If you uh start to get woozy later, which is quite common, stay close to me. I'll get you through it. (chuckles)
What come on? Have you ever dated a woman that worked in your office?
Oh yeeah.. well , Big smoker... I (coughs some more) gave it up for a while but it was too tough. Y' know.....I got no will power.
Let me tell you something about that tag. It's no 31, and uh...let's just leave it at that.
Well, I got just the thing to cheer you up. A computer! Huh? We can check porn, and stock quotes.
Hi, it's me. It's Georgie Boy. What's going on?
(chuckles) Bye, thanks. (To Jerry, when Susan is far) I can't believe she took the money.
There is no problem. . . just a small miscommunication. Whereby you thanked her instead of the person actually responsible for purchasing the big salad.
(Depressed) Well,.. the Andrea Doria.. that was quite a fire. (Moves to the door, leaving)
