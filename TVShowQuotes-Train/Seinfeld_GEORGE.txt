I don't know. She..She's having some problems with this guy she's seeing.
All right, come on, come on, let's go. Six dollars.
(Interrupts) And I still say hes naked under there!
Knock it off, just sit in your seat over there you're distracting me. We're making incredible time here. I once went into Kennedy Airport from West 81st Street to in uh, in 15 minutes. hu uh. Oh, here hold this. It's uh, ten dollars for the tolls.
It'll have to be a night job anyway. You don't normally work after dinner, do you?
For 50 bucks? I'd put my face in the soup and blow.
(Scoffs) No, I told you, I'm not gonna do that.
(shaking his head, weary) It doesn't matter. (he leaves)
The next thing you know, he'll have you driving him to the airport..
Ah, no, no. Are you sure? A girlfriend?
Jerry, I'm not suggesting getting rid of the girl. She's integral.
The nice one that works in my office.
Well, she didn't BUY the big salad. I bought the big salad.
Yes, hello. Party's over. (taking off the suit)
I know what I'm doin'. In fact Mr. Wilhelm gave me one of those little stress dolls. All right. (gets up) Back to work. (acts annoyed and leaves)
(pulling out some money) Uh, yeah. Hang on. Just... yeah.
It's just paper on a roll, that's it. And that's all it will ever be.
Imagine if I had to see them both on the same day? (mirthless) Haha! It's like runnin' a double marathon!
Absolutely. You're telling me there's no room to move on pasta. All starches are a scam.
Oh, no, no, not at all. No, I have always felt that the most important thing in the world is spending time with family.
Well get it back! It's very important. (winks)
What am I scared of? I'm scared of the same thing that you are, everything! Why don't you just use your own name?
Okay. (They walk around each other.) OK. Ill choose you. Whaddaya want?
When you're talking about a movie like "Beaches", moving from the chair to the couch , . . . that's quite a voyage.
Ok. Good. And Kramer, you're in charge of taping off the loading zone.
And why shouldn't you? Be fresh Stay fresh
I leave you alone for two seconds, and this is what you do! I trusted you!
(Pleading) Please, please, they're gonna hit me! (Attempts to grab Helen's purse, she starts hitting George defensively, he backs off)
Specific, Ah, lets see. I've walked in and out of so many buildings they all .. blend in together, I uh, ..
Yeah, you're right, you're right. (To Elaine) Alright, maybe he's not interested, but you still know him - can't you just ask him?
Because before you know it he'll be having lunch with him. You know how these interoffice politics work.
I wouldn't hear of it, Todd. It's none of my business. But you should try to find out everything you possibly can. In fact, I'll even stay all the way on the other side of the room just so there's no chance of me overhearing anything.
He purposely mispronounced my name. Instead of saying, "Costanza" He'd say, "Can't stand ja". "Can't stand ja" ... He made me smell my own gym socks once.
You see those tears streaming down you don't know what to do. It was like she was on fire and I was trying to put her out.
This catalog is all about how to score in a foreign country.
You cant be serious. This is New York city. There must be eleven million decent hotel rooms! Whatta you need? A flag? (waving his handkerchief) This is the signal, Jerry, this is the signal!
Ah, great, great. (sniffs) What's that smell? Smoke? (walks to the kitchen) Hey everybody, I think I smell some smoke back here...(smoke boils into the doorway.) FIRE! FIRE! Get out of the way!
If youre having second thoughts, if you didnt want it, dont worry about it because uh, you know, I, I...I could take it, you know.
Yeah, there was a fire in my apartment.
Kramer, what are you talking about...Janet doesn't look anything like Jerry
Well, you know, I was thinking about what you said before, and...you're right, I've never really been a couple, so...if that's the rule, then I'm gonna go by the rule.
That's it? You don't have to screw it in or anything?
So, what's in the cooler? (flips open the lid)
Wait a minute, wait a minute, do you think I?m comfortable here. I can't change, I?ve got no clothes here! You've got to go like that, I can?t go like this alone!
Yeah and you get this really cool T-shirt when you sign on..
Uh, good. You know, you might wanna try eating it with one of these. (Holds up lobster bib)
Hey, did you know that the Yankees don't wear cotton jerseys?
Five-thousand? Why would anybody buy Kramer for $5000? (laughs)
Okay, go ahead. Call her, get married, have babies, have a great life.. What do I care? I'm finished. (Really depressed) It's all over for me. In fact, let's end it right now. Jerry, kill me, kill me now. I'm begging you. Let's just get it over with. Be a pal.. Just take the pillow and put it over my face.
Why doesn't *he* pick you up after the operation. He's got the car with the bench seats that you like.
Watch the arm! Tim, listen, we don't want to bother you, we know you're busy here.
Ade, I have to tell you, I, I have never met anybody so ... efficient.
I tell you what, you give me the twenty, and I will buy *you* a popcorn and soda, and I'll throw in a bon-bons.
Are you crazy?! What are you doing?! You'll get us killed!
Oh, hello, it's you! (angry) Listen lady, I got six minutes left on that meter, and I'm not budging til you admit you stole my twenty dollars. (smug) Huh-hu-hur, you're not so tough when you're not on your horse, are you Ruthie?
(light) No. No, no, no. The cushion was turned over.
Yeah, I mentioned Simons. Next thing I know, Im in the parking lot. Perhaps they had some sort of a falling out. Ill tell you one thing. I dont know what hes got. But for a sick guy, hes very strong.
(cocky laughter) Huh haha! (shouts) You're meat, Reilly! You just screwed yourself! (laughter) Ha ha!
Well I am. Couldn't you try to go through some of that stuff I put in your shoebox?
Hey listen... umm, instead of the movie... uh, maybe we'll go back and uh you know...(nudges her head with his head)
I can't do this! I can't do it. I have tried. I'm here. It's impossible.
Elaine, I got to have another picture of Gillian.
What is that, Boyfriend? I don't understand that. What, what does she think I asked her out for?
Alright, now you're gonna see some parallel parking. (spitting into his hands and rubbing them together) How I wish you could make a living parallel parking. (turning around in his seat) It's all geometry, knowing all the angles, when to make that first turn and then when to swing it back in, that's the key.
No, it's a Newman. Well, I gotta run. (Smiles, pats his briefcase and exits.)
Alright, how's this? We wait till we get to your street corner, we see Elaine and Kramer then we get out. They can't shoot us in the city.
(breaks a long silence) The uh, the shoe laces that you bought me, they uh, they worked out well. (thumbs up)
Of course I mean that. I am incapable of guile.
Yeah, yeah. Well, I guess I started losing it when I was about twenty-eight right around the time I made my first million. You know what they say. The first million is the hardest one.
Hey, she wants me to dress uh "smart casual." What uh, what is that?
Well I can't break up with her now.
Well, there's going to be a lot of dentists there.
Hey believe me, baldness will catch on. When the aliens come, who do you think they're gonna relate to? Who do you think is going to be the first ones getting a tour of the ship?
That's not how it happened. It's when he fell on him with his knee.
More wine and turkey? (Pours Celia more wine)
(To Jerry) We got work to do. What about the meeting?
I change I change. Two weeks ago I tried a soft boiled egg. Never liked it before. Now I'm dunkin a piece of toast in there and I'm loving it.
...yeah, my wife started getting on me about the lawn today. Im tellin you, its one thing after another.
Yes of course go ahead. My guess is you're going to like this very much.
You don't? Boy, I think about it a lot. I think about it at my age. Imagine how much I'll be thinkin' about it at your age. All I'll do is keep thinkin' about it until it drives me insane...
(gets up and picks a mirror) Yes. Yes, it's white. Why it's white.
Everybody likes pesto. You walk into a restaurant, that's all you hear - pesto, pesto, pesto.
No no no, this ones different. This ones a beauty!
We'll just take a check. (She leaves the check. George, in all his cheapness, can't help but to review the check. He finds an error) You made a mistake on the..
Well, if it doesn't concern me, then I can stay. (Kramer grabs the back of George's chair, drags him out into the hallway and closes the door.)
Im sorry, I dont see the big deal about being a matador. The bull charges, you move the cape, whats so hard?
Hey. Hey. Answer me! Come on, show yourselves!
And it's their anniversary Friday night. I could send them for a hansom cab ride. Y -- you think they'd like that?
I just feel terrible This is just terrible.
Hunh, You know, it's the damnedest thing. I went out the window again to, to get a cup of coffee...
Hey uh, isn't Elaine supposed to meet us?
Don't you see what this says? How can you possibly like somebody ,if you think they look like this?
No, I know I don't have to, I want to.
So, uh, Mom, Dad, I was hoping that you could help me to remember my childhood a little clearly..
So, you wanna go home and...make up, officially?
No! No! Turn it off! No feats of strength! (Gets up and starts running out of the coffee shop) I hate Festivus!
(To Jane) You know, when I was a kid, I once found a dollar and fifty cents in change on the bottom of the pool.
Krama. Open up! I--I know you're in there!
Listen, I have a tremendous favor to ask.
Because you called her by the wrong name.
I think I can sum up the show for you with one word NOTHING.
(hitting Cynthia playfully with a napkin) Stop it, stop it.
I think I saw him. I think it's him.
Wow! Heh. (Half kidding) You don't, huh, have a replacement lined up for me, do ya? heh he he he he he...
Well, Play Now is through playing. They turned the heat way up in my office. They tried to sweat me out.
Isn't that why we have locks on the doors?
. . . I'm a little scared of her.
Nah, it's not a good turn. December. December. Don't you think we should have a little more time just to get to know each other a little.
She said "sweep together" you idiots, not "sleep together."
I can't believe that you saw her before me.
I don't know what you're getting all riled up about. There are probably a million Costanzas-
Alright, let's just examine the situation for a second. Who, in this situation, would be more likely to make a mistake? Me, who had access to my wallet, knew exactly what was in there? Or you--
Ewings hurt? How long is he going to be out?
I can't have any parties while they're out of town. (he leaves to return the soaps)
Why did you refuse the package. Everybody loves a package.
There's gotta be more to life than this. What gives you pleasure?
You don't work in the rain? Your a mailman."Neither rain nor sleet nor snow....."It's the first one.
Well, you never know. (picks up more shrimp) Let's see how many I can fit in my mouth.
We ordered the wedding invitations today,, Nothing can stop it now. Nothing. It's here! It's happening. Can I do this? I can't do this...Look at me. Look at me I can't do this, I can't do this (manic) Help me Jerry, help me.
Ah, excuse me. Do you have, uh, change of a dollar?
Oh, well, a mantel's a whole different story.
A preemptive breakup. This is an incredible idea. I got nothing to lose. We either break up which she would do anyway but at least I go out with some Dignity. Completely turn the tables. It's absolutely brilliant.
It is a horrible company. There's no management what so ever. I could go hog wild in there.
Yes, I agree. I hope my parents go long before I do.
(Needing to get away from his parents, he gets up) I need some air..
Yeah, I would. It's just, you know, I just ate a whole pot roast.
I got a job interview. They want to see me this afternoon.
(to himself) Yeah, you said it. (to Wilhelm) Uh, excuse me, Mr Wilhelm. Uh, do you really think... Well, is this downtown trip really necessary, you know, for the project?
Of course I'm back. Why wouldn't I be back? My mother's in the hospital, I'm going to pay her a visit.
I bet they're probably doing summersaults about us over there. You think they get butler stories like that everyday? (He calls Susan)
You know, that, that thing about her being too good for him. I mean, I was just bein' folksy. They could tell I was just being folksy..?
Lemme see this. (Tries to grab the papers.)
Then why don't you try and get him another job?
I told her what a sexist he is. How he cheats on his wife.
Yes! Yes, I'm the one! Hey! So, you know Jon Voight!
Jerry, a throat-clear is a non-verbal implication of doubt - he thinks I killed Susan!
(smiling) Well, we're certainly glad that you could make it.
Where are we going? Why are we pulling off here?
I've been to a few of em. If you uh start to get woozy later, which is quite common, stay close to me. I'll get you through it. (chuckles)
So what? What am I supposed to do?
Why did he tell you and not me?
Yeah,yeah!! I'll pick you up right now.....All right All right....Hey! gotta go.
Well good, good. Take it off you're going to wear it out already. It's for special occasions this thing.
And you! How many Twix does that make for you, today?! Like, 8 Twix?!
Hey, do you know, Bonnie, I just had a pretty wild idea.
It was a fat camp. Those kids depended on me.
I saw them making out, you can believe it.
All right, I'll tell them my sister died. (Starts fake crying) My poor sister died. She was standing and then she was laughing and then they SHOT her! That's the kind of sick city that we're livin' in. They shoot you for laughing. I must go and comfort my poor family. Jerry, take me home so I can comfort my... my poor family.
All right there you go. It's a '47 cabin all right. So, we'll see you tomorrow.
I think that's Mr. Hayman. ...The gym teacher from our High School.
No, Im saying, if a situation arose in which you didnt want it, I might take it.
(to Jerry) It's all white Jerry! It's all white!
You mean just going there because I'm invited, that's rude?
(???), we'll see you in a little while.
They talk back. They go, "Hey George, how's it going?" I say, "Get the hell out of here!"
So, let me ask you. Do you think I could have done this?
So you think you can put the suit aside and hold it for me?
Out? Oh no, I've been to four other places, you're the only ones that have had it.
Excuse me, are you the guy with that funny laser?
Absolutely, uh, lets see there's, uh, Vandelay Industries, I just saw them. I got very close there. very close.
Oh yes, by no means, the mood. Let me know if there's anything I can do to lend support to the mood.
(after waitress walks away) I don't believe it, she did it again!
What, he can't jump out of the chair? How long does that take? Here look at this. (he moves to the end of the booth) Here, watch. (stands up) Criminals. Boom. I'm up. (pretends he's shooting) Stop It! Stop It! Stop It!
Hey, so, did you give that radio the old switcheroo?
Seemingly. Seemingly. But within that basic framework there are many subtle variations, only discernable to an acute observer, that reflect the many moods, the many shades, the many sides of George Costanza.
Yeah, I want to see if there's anything I can do.. maybe get him another job.. maybe I'll hear of something.
What's the matter with you? Are you crazy? Why are you using my name?!
Well, sir, I - I gave out the fake card, because, um, I don't really celebrate Christmas. I, um, I celebrate Festivus.
Years. When we were kids, they made it seem like it was right around the corner.
Not as good. That's when you realize all the money you're losing.
Do you know the last time I wore this thing? Six years ago, when I made that toast at Bobby Leighton's wedding.
(Snapping) Is that important, really? What is this, a police investigation? The woman's been through enough. She has to relive the experience now?!
Yep. And it didn't take very long either.
Well, maybe it was Ghostbusters? Where ever it was, it worked!
The sea was angry that day my friends like an old man trying to send back soup in a deli!
One of the guys in my cell threw a piece of gum at him.
Thank you! Thank you very much. (Jerry and Melissa stop and look at George)
I have to do this, it's a matter of honor.
Oh, of course. (motioning Estelle to enter) Of course.
Well I just got back from swimming in the pool. And the water was cold...
That's uh, KL5-8383. Are you calling them soon because, they keep very strange hours.
I thought tomorrow maybe we'd try a little corn beef.
All right, all right. Thats it. Im gonna go down there.
You haven't won. You may think you've won, but you haven't won. Do you know why? It's not over. This is not over. I'm not forgetting what's happening here. You have my ten dollars. I will get it back. Alright, don't worry. It's not over. I'm going now. Good bye. I will be back.
If I didnt put that floss in my pocket, Id be crawling around her bedroom right now looking for my glasses.
He's beboppin' and scattin', and I'm losin' it!
(Apprehensively) Um. I just realized. Ya' never gave me back the change from the tolls.
You're Killing Independent George! You know that, don't you?
Well, I think you should drop him down to Step Two.
Have you ever seen a Schnitzer's rye? It - it's huge!
You're telling me. (he walks around and the suit makes a swooshing sound) So, what do you think?
(Standing in the doorway) I'm fine with it! Fi-hi-hi-hine I say! (Leaves)
(animated) What're you kidding me? We were all getting along so well. Where is all this coming from?
You know a lost and found could be a good idea.
You know, I'm down to one kiss hello. My aunt Sylvia.
You could take the IQ test for me. I could pass it to you out a window. We could do it, she lives in the first floor.
All right, Kramer that's it.....( pushes the camera) Hello . English. Does anyone speak English
You're not goin to do it? What do you mean, You're not goin to do it?
I don't know. This sandwich is making me flush.
Ade, you're a wonder. (he he -- george laughs)
Well, I didn't mean to hurt you kid.
So we order lunch, and were talking. Finally, she blurts out how its not working.
(into phone, frantic) Mister Dalrimple! Mister Dalrimple I have to talk to you!
Hey, maybe I could bribe one of those women that hand out the towels in the powder room.
Oh, this is fabulous. My God Elaine, you have to taste this.
Well, I took the liberty of packing your things. (gleeful) Mom's coming to get you.
It's like a magic trick. Sometimes I think it would be easier to bend a spoon mentally than to make that transformation.
I can't go anywhere, I have to wait here for Tatiana's call. Let me just check.
You took me to one of your shows..
(out the window) Keith, Keith, up here. Can you do me a favor? I need you to go to the unemployment office with me. I, I'm Jerry's friend  the guy from the locker room,  I'm the chucker. It'll take five minutes. Wait. Wait.
(knocking on the counter and feigning a muffled, Chinese voice) Chinese food!
Well, you know... the friend meeting the new woman. I feel like I'm getting fixed up for a friendship.
. All right , just give me my car and let me get the hell out of here.
King Edward. (snapping his fingers) King Edward, Jerry.
I told you, he probably went out the back.
(pleading) Elaine, c'mon. Would you just make the call? (indicates the phone) Please, make the call.
You have to stand tough sir. That's why I had to hang up the phone.
Oh no no no no, don't say anything to Kramer. Susan can't stand him. He vomited all over her.
(to Jerry, sarcastically) Yeah, doctor. Im going to have to wait in that little room all by myself, arent I? (He picks up a crossword puzzle.) I better take this. I hate the little room. (George walks into the hallway that leads to the doctors office.) Oh, hello, Doctor.
Right. The other members of our party. (closes partition) Other members of our party? What other members of our party? I didn't even know we were in a party. Oh, I'm telling you, the jig is up.
We'll ask him. (opens partition) My dear fellow, where are you dropping us?
Oh, no no no. I was just looking for stock-pages. Here it is. Looking for the quotes. Gotta check to quotes. Love a good quote. Oh, IBM up a quarter.
'My wife's in a coma.' Yeah? Well, the life support machine called and...
(agitated) He's lying, sir! I'm tired of all your macho head games!
Well she was sending out our wedding invitations.
Yes! Yes! Everybody has to like me. I must be liked!
Oh you mean face down on her chest.
What, are you, nuts? You're gonna spend more on the ticket than you're gonna get back from Grossbard.
You know I'm enjoying it very much. I think my coworkers are really taking to me.
Anyway, I think the guy in the shower opposite saw me. He gave me a dirty look.
Who would Want to. She tried to end it with me, Jerry.
(Interrupting) Anyway, I just wanted to let you know I'm really sorry that happened, and if I can help out in any way, I'll certainly be glad to do that. (Pause) Well, I guess that's about it.
Well I I ..put a lot of thought into this and I think I would like you to sign a prenuptual agreement.
( to Jerry) What about the letter, should I think about the letter?
Hey, Ring Dings are better than anything you're gonna get at a bakery.
I've always liked her. Remember her in 'Carnal Knowledge'?
There was a woman, Audrey. She had a very big nose.
I'm sorry, uh, it's not like I'm gonna see something I've never seen before.
Huh, strawberries, anyone? (eats a strawberry) Ah, that's good. Ooh, juicy this time of year.
What do I do?! What do I do?!
I told you to stop with the hopping.
uh, Uh, Vandelay Industries, is uh. 129 West 81st street. It's a very small industry Vandelay. It's one of the reasons I wanted to uh, work for them.
Yeah, sure, we met at Jerry Seinfeld's apartment. When you fumigated for fleas over there.
Oh, yeah? Holistic.. that's what I need. That's the answer.
Alright, whatever! Now. Whatever caused the damage...(drops a tiny briefcase onto the table in the model)...was jarring enough to completely stop the tape.
(Sitting on the sofa) I'm on no sleep, bro.
Well, they get very hot in the polyester. You know, it's not a natural fibre. I think they would prefer cotton.
No, no. That's just the thing. Anna told me that Elaine said I was one of the worst seeds she'd ever seen.
I told her I would have to think about it.
Well, I told it to Susan before, and she didn't like it.
(Laughs) Steven, nothing is higher than an architect.
Today. Im going today. Just dont do anything until you hear from me.
Robin, listen to me. The most amazing thing has happened. Kramer has opened my eyes. I think I've changed.
It's an inter-office envelope. It get passed around all over the office.
Yeah. She should be commending me for treating everyone like equals.
Do you believe this? We're fighting. We're fighting.
The plane's been re-routed *back* to Kennedy. We've got 45 minutes.
Oh, I don't think you want to do that.
What's the difference? You know they way I work. I'm like a commercial jingle. First it's a little irritating, then you hear it a few times, youre hummin it in the shower, by the third date it's (sings) "By Mennen!".
I don't care. Look, Lloyd doesn't know what he's up against. This is nothing to me. (moving his arm) My whole life is a lie.
You're an alcoholic! You have to apologize. Step Nine! Step Nine.
What about these two? Aren't they gonna chip in?
What are they doin' lettin' you bastards on an airplane? Don't they know that's against FAA regulation?
Well, maybe they're done with it. I could go pick it up.
Then I see my clothes floating out there. The tied took them out, not the kids.
Look...humm..I'm on with Beijing with the hair restauration clinic. Could you talk to them for me and tell them I'd like to place an order.
Great, great. So anytime you want you can just visualize her naked.
(not expecting the statue to be thrown) Dit.
Now, each of you is here because you're the best at what you do.
Jerry! Oh, my God! What are you doing!?!
Oh well, that's, uh, thats just because we're, uh, standing on opposite sides.
Hey I'll get married if I have to. Al Netchie will think twice before he opens his mouth about me again.
Were aware of the proximity to the park, yes.
No, no, no, this suit is not for sale. (tries to take off the suit from the guy)
Someone's have to unhook the boat before it leaves...the place!
You don't understand, there's a *blurb* about me in this magazine!
Okay, uh, eighteen dollars, and there it is. There you go. So maybe we could get together this weekend.
Alright, I gotta go. I'm heading over to Bonnie's.
It was on CNN ( Kramer comes in and he is taping from a Camcorder) This Chinese doctor Zeng Zau. has discovered a cure for baldness.
I had nothing to do wtih any of this! I met all her friends, I didnt want to meet them. I kept trying to avoid it. I knew it would only get me in deeper. But they were everywhere! They kept popping up all over the place. This is Nancy, this is Susan, this is Amy, this is my cousin, this is my brother, this is my father... Its like Im in quicksand.
Oh, I had it perfectly timed out the Grand Central, the Van Wyck! You destroyed my whole timing!
You know it's like you never see a really attractive woman getting a traffic ticket.
Maybe I'll go down to the track. Put it all on a horse...
(surprise) Huh. I never heard you say you admire me for anything.
There it is. Gate 46... We got plenty of time.
Oh, well, don't worry about it -- he's got plenty of money. (spins his chair away from her)
Well, you see, what happened was...the doctor - the very same doctor that was attending to my late aunt - suffered an untimely stroke, and lost the use of his right hand, so...obviously I was unable to get the death certificate. However, I do have this. (Reaches inside his coat and takes out a Polaroid photo.)
Do you realize in the entire history of western civilization no one has successfully accomplished the Roommate Switch? In the Middle Ages you could get locked up for even suggesting it!
(sitting down next to Jerry) Seeing Maura. Apparently, I was unable to break up beyond a reasonable doubt.
If anyone should be forced to leave that place, it should be her!
I'm really serious. I think that's a good idea.
Uh, I just went out, I went to look for my friend?
(Scoffs) ARe you kidding? Lincoln Center. Alice Tully Hall, the Met. Magnificent facilities.
It won't for a while. At least not until after the cast comes off.
I guess you two are the lucky ones.
Yeah. I did some shopping. Some new clothes shopping. (turns to a man) Can I borrow your menu?
Yeah! like the big toe is like the captain of the toes, but sometimes the toe next to the big toe gets so big that there's like a power struggle and the second toe assumes control of the foot.
Well this is bad. I am really in a bad situation now.
I mean I'm the one who bought it.
I know. The only way to fix it now, is to get a whole new photo of Kruger.
Woo! Some day out there - You ever see weather like that? Woo! It's crisp - it's crispy crisp.
Okay. (Chewing) Thanks anyway. (Continues to chew as he exits)
What about the whole Christmas spirit thing? Any flexability there?
Huh, he's a communist. . . . Look at this. "Exciting uninhibited woman seeks forward thinking comrade and appearance not important." . . . Appearance Not Important! This is unbelievable. Finally this is an ideology I can embrace.
What could I do?! We fooled around and went to a movie!
No. (dips the chip) You dip the way you want to dip...(bites the chip) I'll dip the way I want to dip. (dips the chip again.)
Except for one small problem. Hah, I left some books in her apartment.
You fixed me up with a bald woman.
I didn't burn it down - Kramer did!
This is a fantastic place! I always thought it was a meat packing plant!
Could there be a native p0roblem in the Caymans? Maybe theres native unrest.
You want me to roll six thousand of these?! What, should I quit my job?!
(continuing) I feel like a family. In fact, yesterday was Grace's birthday. She's such a sweet woman so, we had a little party, with cake and champagne. I made a toast.
I can't believe you're not playing in cotton.
Oh leave Jack alone. Jack's got enough problems. I'll just take the small office.
But Mr. Steinbrenner, how can I be expected to perform my job properly, knowing that my uh, subordinate is making more money than I am? With all due respect sir, it's outta whack.
Oh, my God.. (Buries his face into his hands)
It became very clear to me sitting out there today, that every decision I've ever made, in my entire life, has been wrong. My life is the complete opposite of everything I want it to be. Every instinct I have, in every of aspect of life, be it something to wear, something to eat ... It's all been wrong. (chuckles) Everywhere.
Well, Steven, I, uh.. (All the sudden, a small gang steps out of nowhere, surrounding George)
Mmm, no. Boy, it really didn't come out too well, did it?
Cause I tell you, frankly, I would like to walk in hear one day and find you sitting down. (Starts to walk out of the store) That would give me a lot of pleasure. Call me crazy.
(Praising Leo's stealing) Alright, Leo! Stickin' it to the man!
I wanna get it back when we were the Gatsbys.
Ha ha ha ha, oh all right, go ahead, deride, deride if you must. But let me tell you something, with my personality and this set of hair, you know what I am now? I am in the game. I no longer defer to the coifed. I'm a player.
Oh, no, Sir. Festivus is all too real. And.. I could prove it - if I had to.
I'm not gonna be nice. That's how I got the job.
I told them I have a place in the Hamptons. What did you say?
Beautiful lineswoman. Alright listen uh I'm going to go to the concession stand and get some real sunblock. You want anything? Jerry? (Jerry is staring at the lineswoman) Jerry?
Well, uh... come in, come, come in. (frantically clears the couch of newspapers and crumbs)
Ava was one of the reasons I used to like going to work, she was a friend. Now we sleep together and suddenly, I don't know how to talk to her. Every time I go to the bathroom I pass her desk. I have to plan little patter. I spend half my day writing. Then afterwards, I sit in my office and analyze how it went. If it was a good conversation, I don't go to the bathroom for the rest of the day. I see her laughing and talking with other people, they're all so loose and relaxed, I think, 'that used to be me. I want to go back there again.'
So what happened? She throw you out? Eh?
Name tags! Name tags! What kind of an idiot thinks anybody would be interested in an idea like that.
Oh, this is all locking in now. It is all locking in! (laughing)
It says very clearly, 'for your protection, do not give your secret code to anyone.'
I was throwing up all night. It was like my own personal Crying Game.
She thinks I'm a nice guy. Women always think I'm nice, but women don'tnice.
How come you don't know what street are you on?
No, I did not! (They exit the coffee shop.)
Don't you understand? It's not about him. To have a line as perfect as 'jerk store' and to never use it. I, I couldn't live with myself.
(Panicky) Uh, yeah. You know, Doctor, I gotta tell you, I feel a lot better.
(upset) But you can't stay here. There's no place to sleep!
Like a "Hey your mother is uglier than Hazel. Hazel really puts your mother to shame"
(attacking Kramer) How could you give me a defective condom?!
Wait a second, wait. Why are we together?
WAIT ,WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!!!!.... Where was the tape recorder?
So, just bring her here. This is all you really need.
You know I still don't know how you can call lunch with me a business expense.
So, tell him you're concerned about it and he should see someone else.
All day. ( phone rings , Jerry picks up)
Stay back! (Runs out of the room, pushing Jerry out ahead of him)
A fan? I would drape myself in velvet if it were socially acceptable. And look at this, hardwood floors!
(Laughs) You, I guess, you don't remember me.. but we actually, kind of um.. went out.. a couple of years ago.. once.. remember?
What is that? Its ridiculous! You dont even know what hotel shes staying at, you cant call her. Thats a signal, Jerry, thats a signal! (snaps his fingers) Signal!
Well, he has to play! He can't just not play. We're playing! Look, I gotta see him, how do I get in touch with him?
Mr. Pensky. I was just working on your file. I was transferring the contents of the file into this flexible accordion-style folder.
No come on, let me, let me. I smashed your car, it cost you over two thousand dollars,
Yeah, I grabbed it on the way out, I don't want my mother reading it.
Are you looking deep down at the real person underneath?
All right, no more lies. Elaine is been chosen to represent the Upper West Side in the next Biosphere project.
He's extremely Murphy. He's Murphy to a fault.
Hey! Uh--listen--did you get your--uh--boss's Knick ticket, for Kramer?
(after hesitating, resignedly) All right. (He sits down and smiles unconvincingly at her)
...so mind you, at this point I'm only going out with her two or three weeks. So she goes out of town and she asks me to feed her cat. So at this time, there's a lot of stuff going on in my life and, uh, it slips my mind for a few days. Maybe a week. Not a week, five, six days.
Yeah. No, no, no, wait a minute, I always have tuna on toast. Nothing's ever worked out for me with tuna on toast. I want the complete opposite of on toast. Chicken salad, on rye, un-toasted with a side of potato salad ... and a cup of tea. (laughs)
Well, I'm still here. You took out the other guy!
Salsa is now the number one condiment in America.
Jerry, unless I pull down on this statuette and a hidden wall opens up, we have checked every square inch of this apartment!
And maybe we could go out and do something.
I think. (Pause as they all look down)
Lot of good ones. I don't even want to mention anyone because I'm afraid I'm going to leave somebody out.
(excited) You're saying I stand to inherit three hundred thousand dollars, is that what you're saying?!
Well, I assume there's some sort of write-off.
I heard what you said "Sharon, are you there?".
Well why couldn't you include me in your excuse?
Sorry, you don't know what's going on out there! (looks at Owen) Who's he?
No no no no, you have to approach this as if he was a woman.
Here. (panicky) We'll leave it here for you!
All right, so what's the penalty here? Let's just pay the fine or something and get the hell out of here.
(sitting) So, guess where Mr 'Ocean phoned' turned up? He's working for Firestone, in Akron, Ohio.
It's just a magnificent stone. (turns to Jerry) Jerry?
So eh, you eh, wanna get together tomorrow?
Hello, oh, hello. You remember, ... Susan, from N B C.
Ho, ho, ho! Hes got a live one. Hes just reeling his big fish in!
For that rent, shed take a bath in the toilet tank if she had to.
Yeah! She made me promise not to tell you .It's supposed to be a joke.
Well, you're gonna have to go to the bathroom!
Apparently the Seinfelds' are too good for us. I shouldn't say anything bad about your uh your partner.
The Rogue's Wallet. That's where he kept his card, his dirty little secret. Short, devious, balding. his name was Costanza. He killed my mother.
"Breakfast At Tiffany's." 90 pages. (Waves a hand like it's nothing.)
Actually I think I'm gonna take a few days off (starts to leave)
That's why the world's in the shape it's in.
Yeah, I never know what's going on there.
Why?! Because you were stabbed, and.. got coffee thrown in your face, and.. uh.. (Points to Alan's bandaged forehead)
No, no, I don't think I'm special. My mother always said I'm not special.
(upset) Well, you've scared her off. We may never see mom again.
(animated) You're letting him have a woman over?!
What? Huh, so I had it all along. How d'you like that? (snorts) I guess I owe that cashier an apology.
I'm not gonna give you my card unless you tell me what it's for!
The better looking they are, the faster they go! I mean, I see they out there on the street, they're zooming around, like a blur. Like they have a motor on their ass.
Ya-see, how could this not have any fat? It's too good.
Did you feel that tension? We use to have banter - (puts menu back with frustration) - there's no more banter.
You think you could hook me up with these guys?
You can go crazy trying to figure that place out.
I'll tell you what. Why don't we just get a couple of dishes and we'll just share 'em.
It was more like a full bodied dry heave set to music.
So, uh, how long has this been going on?
Kramer, trust me, this is the best bathroom in midtown!
Jerry, come on. If my mother keeps shrinking, this is exactly what she's gonna look like in ten years!
Hey, hey, hey! Whats goin on here? (To Jerry) You didnt agree to anything, did ya?
Hey, look at this. This is the same massage chair we're gettin' for Joe Mayo, $60 cheaper.
(Not wanting to make Elaine mad) I guess it's not important.
I don't understand what the big deal is. They let you try on pants.
Well, you should always consider podiatry. (Patting Ricky on the shoulder) There's nothing wrong with the feet. (Ricky looks critically back at George)
Well, if I could talk to the mothers and have sex with the daughters, then I'd really have something goin'.
This is very hard to follow with all the talking.
Uh, twice what youre payin here, but its a great building. Its two bedrooms!
Now, I'm aware that my own physical dimensions are perhaps a little short of perfection.
Its Martine. I think hes dying. He tried to kill himself with pills.
What are you talking about, that's seventy-five bucks! I'm not working, I can't afford that.
She just dislikes me so much... It's irresistable.
Just because a candy bar fails to fall from its perch
I-I'm already here. I'm here. I'm here. Uh, you know what? If you want a computer, call me. I-I gotta go.
No, no, Hey I'll get it. What's in the BIG salad?
It - it's just that I'm here with my parents, and my mother wants me to take a civil service test - and to tell you the truth, I don't even think I'd pass it.. So..
(after Wendy and to the receptionist) Oh, you have a policy! (to the world at large) The delicate genius has a policy! George heads for the door.
(claps hands triumphantly) We might have an 'it'!
"Yeah,yeah yeah yeah! I've seen these.....they sorta ..they make your legs..stronger."
Well a lot of people consider me small and prestigious.
(entering the apartment more fully) Oh. Oh, hi, hi. Hi. Nice to meet you. (peering at the table) What're you having, veal?
Well I don't think she is a multiple sneezer, because she sneezed again later, and it was also a single.
Thanks. Gee, you know, I thought you were mad at me.
(still by the door) What? M-Maura, what are you doin' here? I ended this relationship... twice!
You mean just walk into the staff meeting on Monday morning like it never happened?
UH, ha ha, ... It's just SO frustrating. It's a brand new jacket.
No, no, this is supposed to go to Joe Mayo's apartment.
You're giving me the "it's not you, it's me" routine? I invented "it's not you, it's me". Nobody tells me it's them not me, if it's anybody it's me.
What did they do for toilet paper in the civil war?
Still lookin'. It's pretty bad out there. What about you?
Well what would I say in the note?
Are you kidding me? [Elaine walks past the window glancing in] This is the best tool we have today of measuring a persons' intelligence.
Hello, Ken. It's George Costanza. I think we need to talk.
You telling me that wine is better than Pepsi? Huh (snort), no way wine is better than Pepsi.
She treated me to the Arabian mocha java.
Hey, let's turn off the lights, get some real 'movie atmosphere.'
Yeah, yeah, the flower guy. Listen, I know this all sounds a little crazy, but...
Dont you think you get more without it?
(pleasant surprise) Really? (admonishing) You know Gary, I really have to say, I'm a little bit hurt that you didn't decide to confide in me.
You see, you see? I see things as they are and I say, 'no!' Uh, wait, you see things as they are not and you s- Wait, uh, you see things, do you see things as they are? What do you say when you see things?
Oh I hate to hear this. That kind of growth really irritates me.
She's working late that night. We're - were supposed to have dinner with everybody at eight o'clock so I'll set up the ride for seven o'clock.
Huh-Hi. (looks around a little) Uhm, is Neil here?
This woman drove us out of our minds
Oh uuh, sure, why not. (the blind man hangs on to George's arm) Hey, that's the guy.
Is that what I ask for? The BIG salad?
How could you not know who Bozo the Clown is?
Theyre the ones who should be ashamed. They signed me to a one-year contract. As long as I show up for work every day, they have to pay me.
The prop comic? (Ronnie holds up his water gun and smiles.) Oh, hi...I didn't recognize you, what...did you get a haircut?
I dont know what the hell I said. I gave her an ultimatum and theres nothing I can do. Its a machine. The little light is blinking right now, Come and listen to the idiot. Hey everybody, the idiots on!
(aggravated) Oh, that's not good enough! You don't try and de-sour. You have to sweeten too!
She calls you today and she doesnt make a plan for tomorrow? What is that? Its Saturday night!
He's the guy we're the buying the chair for, remember? It was your suggestion.
You got hookers turning tricks in my car. How's that for starters.
Why? Because we're a team! C'mon! Would you take this for us, dear? Thank you very much. Here we go... (To Morgan) Anyone ever tell you you look a lot like Sugar Ray Leonard? Yeah, you must get that all the time.
You gotta give us odds. At least two to one - you gotta put up two-hundred dollars.
Yes, Im Sorry, it's a new coat. It-it's Gore-Tex.
It was a good idea. Susan liked it. Now, if he hadn't vomitted all over her, we'd be writing it right now.
Alright, I'll tell you what you do. You call her back and give her the "it's me", heh? Pull the old switcheroo.
I'm gonna go meet Danielle. (grabs his coat) There's a new Neil in town! (triumphant laughter) Hahaha!
(Holding out his arms - giving praise) It's beautiful. Now, what do I say?
Well, it's not my fault. You poked me!
Well what would be the point of that?
O.k....(thinks) I think I know where we can get one.
What was wrong with that? I had a different interpretation! Do you know anything about this pretzel guy?! Maybe he's been in the bar a really long time and he's really depressed because he has no job and no woman and he's parking cars for a living! (out the window to honking cars) Alright! Alright! Shut up! Shut up! I hear you! I'm coming down! These pretzels are making me thirsty!
You can't do that, it's none of your business!
I wanna bite into a big hunk of cheese, just bite into it like it's an apple.
Excuse me, sir, do you have the time?
Ah, excuse me, Vice-president Coco, no one cares about your Gammy.
They wanna have another meeting? They wanna buy it?! They wanna but it?! Oh! I tell you! We're gonna be rich!! What are we gonna get for this? Fifty, sixty thousand?
I always look annoyed. Yeah, when you look annoyed all the time, people think that you're busy. Think about it... (acts annoyed for 3 seconds).
"To the victor goes the spoils." What are you going to do tonight?
Canceled? Do I still get credit for the pick up? I was here!
Well, my father works for the United Volunteers, maybe he can get her one.
That's a tough minute. It's like waiting in the shower for the conditioner to work.
All right, All right, all, right!!( gives the headphones to Kramer) How you gonna find out who this is?
Oh, this is my friend, Jerry Seinfeld. I just bumped into him around the corner. Isnt that a coincidence? The funny thing is, I see him all the time.
Well why don't you take off your hat and stay awhile.
I have to rewind it first. (George presses the rewind button on the tape recorder. He and Jerry stand there, waiting impatiently as it rewinds.) Alright, alright.
Oh ah, I uh, will have that for you by after lunch.
You idiots. You're gonna wear down the battery.
Oh no, I can't do it. I-I'm not good at these things, I get flustered. Once I tried to bribe an usher at the roller derby, I almost got arrested.
Kramer, what the hell are you talking about?
Why couldn't you squeeze one of those stupid rubber balls to get your stress out? Why did you have to destroy *twenty-five* computers?
(to Elaine) Do you want us to go with you?
(Annoyingly butting in) Kinda like Superman's fortress of solitude.
Well, if she was a criminal and you had to describe her to a police sketch artist...
(to Donna) Why did you have to get me in trouble?
Yeah, I told her to call me here and to tell anyone who answers the phone to ask for a balding, stocky man with glasses. I better tell him I'm expecting a call.
Well, it's less than twenty-four hours, so I guess I have to!
Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute, don't tell me, don't tell me. It starts with a . . . Duncan Meyers. Oh, wow, this is something. I haven't seen you guys in what, twenty years?
She's playing a recital this week at the McBierney School. You wanna hear her play? I got two extra tickets, you and Elaine could go...
No, Can't be...For instance I remember when we first met, we had a great conversation.
All right, shes not even gonna ask, if we see her, which is remote.
I don't think so, Vic. I've done my homework. '89 Volvo, that's the car for me, it's the one I want.
You want me to find a poem about Susan? May she rest in peace?!
Exactly! You know how they get animals to reproduce in captivity? They just put them in the same cage.
We have no need to speak. We communicate with deep soulful looks.
Umm, Im not. Its just a sociological experiment!
Maybe she just wants to talk to me?
I saw "Titanic". So that old woman, she's just a liar, right?
Apparently the glue in the wedding invitations was a....toxic.
(Desperate to get rid of the book) Alright, I, I'll just take fifty. Do - do we have a deal?
Yeah, he once bumped into reverend Yung Sun Moon.
It's all your fault! You and Elaine! All that orgasm talk. She did have an orgasm, she didn't have an orgasm. Orgasm this, orgasm that. I got so focused on it. I started to panic and boom, I lost it. I tried everything, I was talking to him 'Please wake up, do something.'
(Shocked) She's pregnant? Leslie is pregnant?! Oh, see, there is no justice.
Wait, wait, did you ever see him throw up?!
I just got here. My car broke down on the Belt Parkway.
No, you just tell him ah, an old boyfriend has come back into your life.
Really? Because people do meet in places besides a bar, huh?
Wait, have you ever seen him throw up?!
Allright, very good I'd like my car and my deposit back please
Wait a second. 'Little places to go, where they never close.' What's a little place that never closes?
So you don't speak *any* English at all?
Well you know what happens with larvae hatch, they-they're everywhere.
(attempting sincerity) As much as I'd like to see the two of you living it up in a warm, tropical, setting, I, I would just miss you too much. (smiling) So, I've decided, I want you to stay.
(thinking) Oh my God, it's 701. What have I done? My whole plan is depending on Kramer? Have I learned nothing? How could I make such a stupid mistake? He'll never show up!
Alright, well why don't we smooth the head down to nothing, stick a pumpkin under its arm and change the nameplate to Ichabod Crane?
The whole hour just flew by. (laughs - hehe) (Begins cleaning up the table.)
(on an imaginary microphone) Uh, no, not at this time.
Look at that guy. Right there. Isn't that the guy from the show? He's..he's wearing the jacket.
But really, it's enough with the bar already.
Well I was dropping of the calzone money for the week.... Um shouldn't you be at work by now?
(still on the phone) All right fine.... Whatever
He wants to meet you? I'll tell you what. I'll show up. He doesn't know we're friends. I'll pretend I haven't seen you since High School. I'll back up the story.
He did it right as he said "her unfortunate accident."
Wait a minute, call the car phone, see what happens.
When are you going on your next date with her?
So, you know, she calls and says she wants to go out with you tomorrow night? God bless! Devil you!
I can never get the package open in time.
Well, if it's as good as ``Ponce de Leon'', I'll be happy.
Was this something you had planned for a while?
Yeah. (Points to two open seats in front of Jerry's. To Nina) Sit down there. (Sees Jerry in the crowd) Hello, Jerry. (Obviously angered at Jerry) I believe you know Nina.
Alrighty. Ah ... my last job was in publishing ... I uh got fired for having sex in my office with the cleaning woman.
Aah, hey. (enthusiastic) If this works out, forget about it. Vacations together, movies together, dinner together. It..it's almost as good as if I didn't get married.
Does the heater even work in this car?
Now if you will kindly help me unwedge my front wheel, I'll be on my way.
Who gets picked off in softball? Its unheard of.
Two tickets to "Guys And Dolls"! I'm gonna go with you!
What do you mean, I got? You didn't give him his Visa application.
Huh? You know? Spring. Rejuvenation. Rebirth. Everything's blooming. All that crap.
You're gonna rip it. You're gonna rip it.
No, Julie, Julie, don't insult me. You know, what difference does it make who pays for lunch. It's totally meaningless.
Nothing really, you know...just eh, stroll around the cell blocks, maybe eh, take in a shower fight. (chuckles.) Hey eh, you know you got a bounced check hanging up in the little market over on Columbus?
You said you grabbed it outta there real fast, right?
I've seen squeeze mustard. I've never seen squeeze ketchup.
Oh, thats great. Thats great. By the way I have to apologize for my friend the other day. Friend? Uh, uh I dont even know that woman. I met her on the bus on the way over. I couldnt get rid of her. Uh, My psychic instincts were a little off ..
You said the guy gave you an open-lipped kiss!
Well, it's . . . much too low.
I'll tell you what's insane the price that I could get you on a new desktop computer.
My cousin worked for Bouchard's. They used to use the bouilla-base for a toilet. (Jerry and Russell are shocked.)
Alright, what's the difference. What are we gonna do now? He won't take our calls, we can't get into his office...
Yes, well, if you had never taken your keys back from Kramer, he never would have taken his back from you and given 'em to me, in which case I wouldn't have had to take mine back from her.
You open the door to the car, boom, you walk right into the hospital. Eh, You can't beat that spot. (starts doing a little dance) I am on a roll. I'm just willing these great parking spots.
I think it's neat. You don't hear that much about god anymore.
(wondering) Maybe he doesn't. Maybe he and I are exactly the same, except for one minor, yet crucial, detail. You never know.
(Losing it) does not imply transfer of ownership. Moe, Sol, or Lem is not gonna get away with this!
In any other shoe, I lose two inches. I - I can't have a drop down. We were eye to eye, I can't go eye to chin!
What? I'm not eating bread now. I'm off bread.
(as the others are repositioning the tables) No, no, you can't do that, they're round, it makes an 'eight' and, yeah, well alright.
You don't know what that spot means to him. Once he gets it, he doesn't go out for weeks.
He's with the touring company of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. He's the guy in charge of the wigs.
You are a good friend. You know what? Even if you killed somebody I wouldn't turn you in.
You can stuff you sorries in a sack, mister!
I don't see why's she more self-conscious about that than her toe thumbs.
Do you really think I'm wrong about this Wyck guy?
What do you mean "might"? You don't think he really owned this car?
You know what you should do? You should tell this guy you're seeing somebody else. That's the easiest way to get out of these things.
Oh, the hell with it. Let him kill me. I..
I show up. I pretend I have the job. The guy's on vacation. If I have the job, it's fine. If I don't have the job, by the time he comes back, I'm ensconced.
No. Now I'll always have this doubt about the car. What, your jaw still hurts?
All right, relax, tough guy. I got to go out to my father's garage, help him sell some computers.
Well, I am just a T-bone kinda guy. Love that T-bone. In fact, you might as well call me--
No-no-no, Kramer. Kramer! Kramer! You *cannot* abandon people in the middle of an airport pickup! It's a binding social contract. We... we must go forward... not back.
Oh, these are my friends, Elaine and Jerry, ... Noel
Well, at the Yankees it was all about smoothing things over, you know, chiseling away, grinding down. In fact we used to call it 'the grind'.
Oh no! Im vigilant. Theyll never get me out. Im like a weed, Jerry.
(eating a pickle) Well they're his tickets, he can do what he wants with them.
No, no. I just got here. A few minutes ago.
Yeah, they eh, they do a lot of baking up there.
Yes, yes, she had a nose job. I loved her very deeply. Will she ever speak to me again?
Eh eh eh, can't do it, can't do it, sorry, I got a date.
Yes, well, you know, Im not thinking about the price. You know youre the only woman Ive never thought about the price. Get the lobster. I beg you to get the lobster. Go for the lobster.
[trying to act as if he doesn't care one way or the other, but we know better] Either way.
Theres just no justice. This experience has changed me. Its made me more cynical, more bitter, more jaded.
Lesbian wedding. How do they work bride and groom out, what do they flip a coin?
Why shave every day? It just grows right back.
(George is telling a story. Karen is laughing and she seems to be the only one to find him funny) So I go into this clothing store and the saleswoman is wearing this (whistling) low cut thing. So I said to her "Can I ask you a question? When you put on a top like that, what's your tought process? What's going on in your mind?"
(anxious) I forgot who I am! Who am I?!
Kramer, Kramer, I need to know if Nina is refunding.
No no no, that's in the right position.
Well it's a little strange. You going to start to talk like Elaine from now on?
All right, if she puts the bags down before she greets you, thats a good sign.
Yeah, just tell him to hurry it up.
I mean he's a good fighter and a nice guy but I don't like him.
I can do hard time for this one. And community service!
I have to talk to Elaine. This cleaing lady is turning the screws on me. She's pushing for this whole relationship thing. She keeps calling me, threatening to go to the boss with this thing, I could lose my job, I gotta do something to keep her quiet.
Would you mind helping me out with some of this stuff?!?
Let me ask you a question. Who would win in a fight between you and me?
...and the Jews steal our money through their Zionist occupied government and use the black man to bring drugs into our oppressed white minority communities.
Yes! And I put him up to it, because I'm sick! I'm the one that needs help.
What, you are comparing me to Biff Loman, very encouraging. The biggest loser in history of American literature.
I'm not stable? I'm like a rock. I take these glasses off, you can't tell the difference between me and a rock. I put these glasses on a rock. You know what jumps into most people's minds? Costanza!
I'll fake an illness. (Acts it out) My back! My back! I can't believe, my back.
Elaine, can I just explain something to you very privately here? Susan and I have been together many, many times now, and just between you and me, there's really no big surprises here, so...make-up sex is all that I have left.
Well, not really. After all, she did get together with George Peppard. I mean, Fred.
Oh, Hey, eh, there's a spot right in front of the liquor store. You see
I love the chop sticks. I, I personally prefer a fork but they look very nice.
Yeah, yeah. Shes punctual... and uh shes been late, sometimes.
Probably. They all do. In my high school, half my graduating class had them. Of course, I'm from Long Island, so...
What's it gonna be? ... You hear that?
(playing with toys) Ahhhh, Yes! Touch down! Your turn, Jerry. (hands Jerry the Mattel Football. George starts playing with the Etch-a-sketch.)
He wouldn't put it on if he didn't like it.
Oh, don't look. T-This is the part where they change me.
Yeah, fun. IQ tests are totally bogus. They prove nothing.
(to Elaine) He asked you to get the mail?
No, no. It wasn't a shift, I've shifted, this was a move.
(shouted after Elaine) You know, I got nothing outta this!
Really? I never heard of a semi (the "i" sounds like an "e") tractor-trailer. (Jerry nods in agreement)
Exactly, but theyre on there  waiting. She said she cant wait to see me, were having dinner tonight. Shes supposed to call me as soon as she gets home.
What, did you go swimmin'? It's 29 degrees out!
All right! All right. I'll tell you what. How about this? Got the date; March 21st, the first day of spring.
You think she would care about the red dot?
ahhhhh (exhaling) Jerry, my young friend, you're so nave. You are so, so nave. You know about a few things. You know about comedy, a little bit about relationships, some baseball, but you are so far out of your element here, you are embarrassing yourself. Now listen to me. I'm negotiating. Negotiation, this is what'cha do in business.
You think she liked me? She seemed to like me.
Yeah, I should do the opposite, I should.
I've been doing a lot of thinking. This might be my chance to start giving something back.
Seemingly. Seemingly, to the untrained eye, I can fully understand how you got that impression. What looked like pushing...what looked like knocking down...was a safety precaution! In a fire, you stay close to the ground, am I right? And when I ran out that door, I was not leaving anyone behind! Oh, quite the contrary! I risked my life making sure that exit was clear. Any other questions?
Youre a back-up, youre a second-line, a just-in-case, a B-plan, a contingency!
[to himself] Argh! [to Susan] Susan! Hi! Oh, boy! What are you doing here?!
Be careful, you're getting blood all over the car.
No they don't. I tried that once. I snubbed for a year. Nothing. Every woman I saw, I snubbed. You never saw people so pleased. (Elaine returns from the bathroom.)
(shouts) Awright already!! This is a very key issue with me, Jerry. I had this name for a long time.
No! No. It's not good, I don't think so.
I dunno. I was just talking to the man and he walked out on me!
I'm sure he'll be back in a second.
Ho ho ho ho! I can't wait for Hanke to come crawling back to me.
The *bank*? This is *found* money. I want to *parlay* it. I wanna make a big score!
I can't carry any changes in these pants, it falls out.
Are you kidding? I lie every second of the day. My whole life is a sham!
What the hell are you two talking about? (All exit)
Oh of course you can use it, sure. (Jerry saying stuff through the phone) Ok, bye. (hangs the phone up)
Hmm-hmm, not by a long shot. I'm calling up the Rosses and inviting them up to my non-existent place in the Hamptons. Then we'll see who blinks first.
I'm gonna get some more of these kosher cocktail franks.. (leaves)
No I, I want it if you dont want it.
We just came from Chadway's(?) What's going on.
I think I may be in love with this woman.
Oh, boy I was up to four in the morning watching the Omen trilogy.
(Frantically, takes phone and screams...) He'll call you back.
This is a crude mock-up of the conference room. 1/14th scale.
Excuse me just for a second. ( fixes his hair looking at his reflection in a coffee pot.)
I think that's what the back of closets are for.
Excuse me, the guy is wearing a jacket that my friend is...
You're right, how did I miss that? (Begins unlocking the door, mutters under his breath) Maybe because it's a crock of shit.
My dad was a cook during the Korean War. Something very bad happened, ever since you can't get him near a kitchen.
So are you going to Todd's party this weekend?
So you really understand my point about building a rocket and double-parking.
Who are you to play God!? Every man's time comes! If his number is up, who are you to interfere!?
Whew! Anybody see that poster in there? That is weird, wild stuff, huh? Whew!
I just wanted to tell you that I really enjoyed Fair Game. I thought it was just brilliant.
And she slaves to earn every penny. So that someday, I might be able to walk up to a woman and say, "Yes, I'm bald, but I'm still a good person."
I had no Idea you were filled with such....sexuality..
Its been a long night. You go home and get some sleep.
Any more grape juice? (Gets up and goes to the kitchen. Remy moves to the end of the couch where George was sitting.)
When you're playing the piano do you think about me?
(to Carrie) It's just that, I know her, and boy...
I said, Listen Marlene, and then the next thing I know, Im in the middle of it. And theres this voice inside of me going, Youre doing it! Youre doing it! And then she started to cry, and I weakened a bit. I almost relented, but the voice, Jerry, the voice said, Keep going, keep going. Youre almost out! Its like I was making a prison break, you know, and Im heading for the wall, and I trip and I twist my ankle, and they throw the light on you, you know. So, somehow I get though the crying and I keep running. Then the cursing started. Shes firing at me from the guard tower. Son of a bang! Son of a boom! I get to the top of the wall  the front door. I opened it up, Im one foot away, I took one last look around the penitentiary, and I jumped!
I should probably get going too. If I don't feed Pequita by seven, she goes all over everything.. take it easy.
Id like a doggie bag for this please. (hands her plate to the waitress)
What did you do here? You took out the wrong guy.
You were supposed to deliver my calzones. We had a deal!
So, they didn't give you a piece of cake? Big deal.
Oh, I can't believe you're dropping out, too. So now Kramer and I have to pay for the entire gift?
Yeah, yeah, sure, Christmas. Snow. Santa. All that stuff.
What difference does it make what she looks like?
Yeah, you know, what'd she uh, look like?
It's like I'm Neil Armstrong. I turn around for a sip of Tang and you jump out first.
Maybe this is what the pilot should be about, vomiting on somebody's vest.
(sad) Yeah! Yeah. Hey--hey you, you know.. Maybe I'll call you sometime.
(rage) Oh, it's got cachet, baby! It's got cachet up the yin-yang!
Alright, but no later, because my parents are coming back.
This is not good. World's are colliding! George is getting upset!
Got it. (the waitress walks away) Did you just see what happened here?
That's why I peeked. (Jerry opens the door to take some trash out, and meets Kramer and Gail in the hallway.)
(Motioning toward waitress) I think she likes me.
Uh, Carol, can I talk to you for a second? Right now?
Fine. Excellent. Could you do me a favor? Could you not tuck the blankets in? 'Cause I can't sleep all tucked in.
All I want is my seventy-five cents back, an apology, and for him to be fired!
I tried to tell you, but you wouldnt listen. No, ho, ho! You were gonna get a deal, huh? Theres no laws in this place. Anything goes! Its Thunderdome!
We all got along. Everyone seemed very pleasant.
I used to share that same outlook. But now, I have so many things to occupy my mind. For instance, the atom.
"Hey you know , I felt we had like a synergy out there,you know, like we were really helping each other."
Thanks a lot. Ill give it back to you in a week.
Anyway, as I was lying in the puddle, I-I think I may have found a way for us to get Bonds and Griffey, and we wouldn't have to give up that much.
Hey, by the way, if anybody wants an inside tour of the zoo, Siena works there as a trainer.
No keys. And I been calling the city all day. Course there's not really a number to call if you wanna make a pothole.
I thought I saw him look in the mirror suspiciously.
And, it is all because of that car
...and then when I saw the photo I remembered where I'd seen him; the boom box incident.
What are you like a sadist? No matter how bad somebody feels, you can make 'em feel worse. I bet you're rooting for a tumor. (pointing to her)
(Holding his drink up to his mouth) Oh my gosh, I just had a great idea. She could come to the party tomorrow and read Gwen's lips for me.
I got some cufflinks I could've loaned you.
Let me digest it. Let me get my money's worth. Y'know what would be good is if there was someone else in the bathroom that could tell me.
Oh, I found him. He was sitting on the steps of the library. I sat down next to him. He smelled like the locker room after that game against Erasmus
The point is, however it got done, it's done. So, any luck with the car?
Well, it's not that. I just, you know, I thought that we were both uh...
Excuse me, darling, do I detect a Portuguese accent?
Why don't you just get some Ring Dings from the liquor store?
I'll fight ya! Not the face! Not the face! (The struggle continues.)
Listen, lemme ask you a question. What if I got a cup of coffee with her?
Nah, nah, it's uh, it's a long story. Just uh, try to get it up.
(Starting to panic again) What? Oh my God. What? Is it meningitis? Scoliosis? Lupis?! Is it Lupis?!
Man, would I like to see the look on his face.
(on the phone) Uh, Mrs. Ross? It's-it's George.
This week. My father got a deal from a friend of his. It's Gore-Tex. You know about Gore-Tex?
Hey check this out. I go to pick up my pictures and she says " I hope you got that mustard stain out of your shirt."
You got your own shampoo, conditioner, body lotion! Jerry, body
Im starving! I can feel my stomach sucking up against my spine.
I got scared there for a second. The Knicks without Ewing.
Um, hi, its George, George Costanza, remember me? The guy that didnt come up for coffee. You see, I didnt realise that coffee didnt really mean... well, whatever. Anyway, it was fun. It was... it was fun, so... oh boy, um, so... You call me back. If you want. Its up to you, you know, whatever you wanna do. Either way. The balls in your court. So uh, take it easy.
Can't find them. That's marvelous. The dance continues.
Right. He cooks my food, he cleans my house, he does all my shopping for me. And there you go, that's your program.
Hey, I work for Kruger Industrial Smoothing "We don't care, and it shows."
Do you see what this is turning in to? Do I need this. I have to get out of this thing.
Oh, ok. Thank you. It was good talking to you.
No, I-I-I know... [retreats back to his Chinese take out] I know...
I am not! What you call wasting, I call living! I'm living my life!
She had this throaty , sexy kind of whisper.
(Looking at her nose) Is your nose pierced?
...meet the Mets. Come on in and greet the Mets.
I can't believe I get paid for this.
Maura. (starts acting dramatically, looking from Maura to Loretta and back again) Oh, my God! What are you doing here?!
This is nighmare. Kramer how long was I on?
Come on! No doctor would put that on his car.
Well, this is the Jerry Seinfeld that only I know. I can't believe I just told you that.
Oh no no no, if you must know, I would rather be with her than go to the game.
Hello? Amanda. Hi, yes. Listen. You know, I'm thinkin', we might just be better of bein' friends. Yeah. Yeah, you know what, I can't even really talk about it right now. Bye-bye. (hangs up) (happy with himself, but then sees the burned up photo) No! No!
So, you were saying how, um...about the script...
(Takes a few seconds to mull this one over. Shooting Jerry a confused look, he repeats it) "The panties your mother laid out for you"? (Jerry nods) What does that mean?
We get to go to the opera together!
I guess she did. He's gone, now I'm the man.
I can't believe I missed Kramer. You know he asked me to go with him to California.
Never mind what happened, just give me the key.
Yeah, I know that. (clears throat) Could you start, working?
Boy - I'm really surprised at Elaine - that whole phone business - she should know better than that.
Got her machine. Im dead, Im a dead man. Thats it. Im dead, Im a dead man. Dead man.
I solve problems. That's just what I do.
Well then, from out of nowhere, a huge tidal wave lifted me, tossed like a cork and I found myself right on top of him, (ELAINE gasps quietly Ahhhh) face to face with the blow-hole. I-I, I could barely see from the waves crashing down upon me but, I knew something was there so I reached my hand in, felt around and pulled out the obstruction!
All these years I've been chuckin' and you've never told me?
No... (takes off his glasses and wipes his eyes with his sleeve)
(hearing Jerry broke up with Patty) Are you still down in the dumps? Come on. It's just a chick.
And then in the fifth inning, why did you take off on the pop fly?
All right. Shh! I gotta focus. I'm shifting into soup mode.
You put a hot tub... in your living room?
No, no no it's not about postponing. I just think the first day of Spring is the perfect day to get married. You know, Spring! Rejuvenation! Rebirth! Everything is blooming all the
She's like a district attorney. If it's not the truth, I'll break under the cross. I actually have to do it.
Did I tell you I ran into her last week? Ho-ho, she looked great.
(Yelling out to the whole coach) Funny guy! (Points to Jerry) Right here!
(Still mad a Leslie) Never said goodbye. Goodbye!
No, I brought a picture of the chair.
What are these? (Holds test tubes to his head like antennae) Take me to your leader.
I cant. I met them. Theyre devout. You know, in the cab on the way over here, I actually thought about converting.
You know what I've come to realize? I'm not just bored. I genuinely dislike her.
Well I didn't know you wanted to go to the flea market.
(cheerful) Alright, there you go. She's gonna get the jacket back. (claps hands) So, let's go get some coffee, huh?
Yes, now. It's gonna take a few days and my parents are gonna be back. I gotta have it back before them!
(Puts nuts into his mouth, and in the process covers his mouth) We bring her to the party, and she can tell me what Gwen is saying about me.
So I really liked the pictures I picked up here yesterday.
Because I cant call a woman with other people in the room. Come on, lets go.
I could go bumper to bumper with any one else on this planet!
Oh, it's a bad day. Uh, you got everyone in your house, you're thinkin', "These are my friends?!"
(To a passing waitress) I'll have some coffee and a doughnut.
(through mouthful of food) So, Carrie, you and Susan are cousins. So your baby daughter is gonna be Susan's second cousin, right? So what does that make me?
I got a feeling I'm gonna be much smarter than you pretty soon.
That's right! He never apologized to me for saying that I would stretch out the neck hole of his sweater.
(on phone, as Jerry gestures beside him) No, Lindsay, it was not IN the garbage. It was above the garbage. Hovering. Like an angel. Of course I know your aunt bit it. I kissed her goodbye. Listen, can I tell you something else? In my family, we used to eat out of the garbage all the time. (Jerry makes a face) It was no big thing. That's right. Oh, okay. Buh-bye. (hangs up phone) I'm back in, she gave me a second chance.
$2? But everyone in front of me got free bread.
By the way, how did Puddy get back in the picture?
you know, just by conversing, you can really learn a lot about a person.
(he thinks) I think the hats. The hat conveys that solemn religious look you want in a faith. Very pious.
But now I have my own market research. Actual Japanese viewers, that love the show! I'm gonna talk to Kramer.
I can't believe they actually found your stolen car.
Wow. Uh, what do I have to do?
Hey, I just found twenty dollars! I tell you this, something is happening in my life. I did this opposite thing last night. Up was down, black was white, good was -
No not vast (he pronounces it as "vost")
Why did it all turn out like this for me? I had so much promise. I was personable, I was bright. (Elaine turns showing disagreement) Oh, maybe not academically speaking, (Elaine nods correct) I was perceptive. I always know when someone's uncomfortable at a party.
I can't get a massage from a man.
No, not nervous. I'm good, very good. (A beat, then he snaps) I can't do this! Can't do this!
Whaddya mean, you'll ``get'' the popcorn and the soda?
What if her experience with me *drove* her to it?
Why? Why? 'Cause he's off his rocker! That's why.
(worried) Alright, alright. Look, we're people, you and me, huh? Businessmen. Colleagues, if I may. Let's not quibble. We'll do it for the thirteen thousand. Thirteen thousand, and I never came up here, we never talked, alright. You take good care. (moving past Russell toward the door) It was nice seeing you again, and nice meeting you. (to Cynthia) Cynthia, right?
All right, do you mind? I have the window! (To Willie) Now, what are you gonna do about my Twix?
bowling! what do you say bowling? bowling's insane! bowling is crazy time
(together -- with arms extended -- palms upwards) Stan The Caddy.
You know what? I changed my mind. I, uh, I don't think so.
Yeah, the kind that Castro smoked. You can't buy ?em anywhere.
You're not a doctor. You shouldn't even have books like this.
I noticed people staring at my head because they like what they see.
The story is the foundation of all entertainment. You must have a good story otherwise it's just masturbation.
Jiffy Park. It's incredible.. Seventy-five dollars a month.
You know, it's a miracle you're not married. (beat) Hey, I'm not obligated to buy anything, am I?
Oh (snorts) Articulate....Me? I've never articulated anything, i'm completely incoherent.
This is a brand new jacket. Boy this really burns me up, ...
Well perhaps, not to the extent that you are. But I know the basic plot. Yeah.
That's a picture of me next to the coffin.
It's funny! (To Elaine) and it wouldn't kill you to not be so funny either.
(bored to death) Well, I-I just recently uh...
Aah, yeah, yeah. Won't you head on in, we'll be in in a second. Be right with you.
It's one think to not give me the extension But to tease and to torture me like this. There's no call for that.
(whispering) Glenda, can I ask you a favor? Can I have this seat?
Well what if she calls me? What am I supposed to say?! (hand hits the table)
You know what? I could probably do this. Whats the difference.
Yeah, yeah. That's how they talk in the major league. (laughs)
(Looking over the writing materials they just bought) Bics? What, d'ja get, bics?
Yes. You know the uh flood, and the uh lepers, and the commandments and all that.
I lost them. I can usually come up with one good comment during a meeting but by the end it's buried under a pile of gaffs and bad puns.
I don't want Morgan's job. He's got a lot of work to do. Hey, Elaine, your friend never woke up Mr. Morgan.
Yeah. I may have stepped on her arm, too, I don't know.
Behind the dugout, that's where we were sitting the other day.
You see. You see! Listen when is your next drawing class?
And people come in the store and you get involved in their lives.
Oh sure, sure. You wanna be alone, sure. I understand that, you wanna a little time to think uh thing..ponder things..you know..ruminant..(chuckles) you go ahead, lotta stuff on your mind..you think things out..Think, mull, mull, do a lot of mulling. (short laugh then exits Monk's)
(to the cab driver) Excuse me, do you see anything on my lip here?
(interrupting) You know we should really order, the service is so slow here, by the time you get anything...
Gee, Kramer, I uh...I don't know what to say.
Oh, that's the worst part of it. He looks just like me.
so, uh, Steven.. I see you're president of the chess club.
What do the Chinese have to gain by faking a cure for baldness?
(on tape, singing) "Believe it or not, George, isn't at home, please leave a mes-saaage at the beep. I must be out or I'd pick up the pho-one. Where could I be? Believe it or not, I'm not hooome." (beep)
He's on the lamb(?), he's on the loose!
Oh. It's just horse manure (huh huh - laughs, he points back at the horse that walked by) Horse manure's not that bad. I don't even mind the word manure. You know, it's, it's nure, which is good. and a ma in front of it. MA-NURE. I mean when you consider the other choices, manure is actually pretty refreshing.
All right. So, you hold out your money, speak your soup in a loud, clear voice, step to the left and receive.
I gotta go back to the library and talk to him. I gotta find out if I&Mac226;m the guy who ruined his life.
Can you believe he sold his glasses on the street?
No, I was just wondering... if you guys, uh, had any gum.
(we hear him think) My friends are idiots, she doesn't look like Jerry. She doesn't look like anybody. And so what if does look like Jerry,what does that mean?. That I could have everything I have with Jerry but because it's a woman I could also have sex with her....And that somehow that would be exactly what I always wanted.....She doesn't even look like Jerry..
You gotta look at this. I pulled it in perfectly equidistant from the car in front of me and the car behind me.
Yes but then everything is all pulled down and it's jus.. Anyway. The damage, unfortunately, has marred an otherwise fine automobile, rendering it virtually undriveable.
(to Jerry) Whos going to play left field?
Do I really have to buy her something?
Where are you living? Are you here? Are you on this planet? It's impossible. It can't be done.
Well, I've to every Brentano's. This thing's flagged in every database in town!
Oh. Okay, here it is, I got it. She lost her thumbs in a tractor accident and they grafted her big toes on. They do it every day.
Seriously, have they though about changing the setting?
So I spoke a little to your little friend Denise last night.
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. All right. I don't think we're gonna have any problem with that. (chuckles nervously) Good talking to you Tom. Really.
Im keeping it. Im going down with the ship.
Listen to this. Marcy comes up and she tells me her ex-boyfriend was over late last night, and "yada yada yada, I'm really tired today." You don't think she yada yada'd sex.
This is dating , you can't leave anything to chance.
I wonder if, ah, Susan ... (picks up the phone from the coffee table, then decides not to call) No. I better just go. (claps hands) heh. All right! See ya. (grabs his rain coat from the hook by the door and rushes out)
What's to think about? If Putty says it's what it is, it's what it is. He's not gonna cheat you.
That's it. This is it. I'm done. Through. It's over. I'm gone. Finished. Over. I will never work for you again. Look at you. (laughing) You think you're an important man? Is that what you think? You are a laughingstock. You are a joke. These people are laughing at you. You're nothing! You have no brains, no ability, nothing! (knocking object over on desk) I quit!
Alright, alright, fine. (Gives the keys to Elaine.)
It's, uh, it's not a little chicken. (laughing) Little chicken. It's a gamebird.
Ah, Alright, before that, I was in real estate. I quit, because the boss wouldn't let me use his private bathroom. That was it.
And get a picture of him, with his shirt off.
Who's Bozo? Bozo the Clown, that's who Bozo is. When I was a kid, Bozo the Clown was the clown, bar none.
So now, the father is screaming at me, he's demanding that I pay for the boom box. Finally, I gave them a fake address and got the hell out of there.
Na, he's gone. I wonder what happened to him.
Its an incredible deal. I dont know why you dont come with me.
Just..go back. Pretend the whole thing never happened.
What, was that not politically correct? It's a legitimate question.
Wait, as a matter of fact, wasn't there some guy in your building that you said you liked? He lived up on the fifth floor or something.
He frolfs, he scores...(he drops one invitation on the stairs.)
What if he left you a used Kleenex, what's that, a valentine? Now you go up to him and you tell him that if he's thinking of turning me in, that I got the goods on him!
we rode along all the way to the hospital
Good. Cause if this is a lie, if this is a joke, if this is your idea of some cute little game we're finished!
Hey, hey, hey! You don't call me back?!
I'm the one he wants! He's coming to settle the score.
(nervous) All right now we're going bye bye.
When you sent me the-the bill for the dry-cleaning. I thought the show didn't have a chance.
I don't wanna tell you how to run your show.
Youre not getting no Drakes Coffee Cake for fifty cents. Yae, Hey, Im all set. I got the ticket. Im going to the Cayman Islands this Friday.
Me too, really. Unless you'd really like to get one.
Oh, no, that's just the old, uh, the old handicap acting up.
Right.. the sign. (Hesitates, then makes a series of stupid gestures)
I'm not her boyfriend. I want to be her boyfriend.
Hi, we're from the United Volunteers, we've come to pick up the TV.
Between the car getting totalled, the towing charge and the fine, there's no way I can ever pay him back...
May I just use your bathroom for a moment?
Oh, what are you, like, a Quaker now?
(to Kramer) This man is a genius. Genius!
I keep wracking my brain to try and figure out what I did. I was smart, I was funny, I made great small talk with the waitress so she could see I could relate to the commoners, you know, I'm a man of the people.
Same thing. My god, I'm getting married in December, do you know that?
(thinking of the moans) Heh. (Karen takes another puff of her cigarette) You seem like you really enjoyed your Risotto. (chuckles) You have a very contented air over there. (chuckles again) You look very contented, very satisfied. (pauses) Are you satisfied?
That's not funny. So, are you coming to the party?
Hey I get a free trip to Paris, I go in the Big Brother's Hall-of-Fame, I mail my own postcards.
Jerry gargles? Is that why he takes so long?
What, you don't think I can attract beautiful, intelligent women?
(Arms out) I am king of the county. You?
(laughs hysterically, gesticulating wildly) This is all blowing up in my face! My serious girlfriend, and my torrid love affair have accidentally crossed paths. I have ruined three lives... (grabbing coat) Well, I understand if you never want to see me again, so... (points towards door)
That's exactly what I said, except I used the word "momentum".
Well, it would be OK if Darryl was here.
All names sound strange the first time you hear 'em. What, you telling me people loved the name Blanche the first time they heard it?
Pay phone in L.A., look it's a miracle.
You only went in front first 'cause you saw me backing up and you didn't have room to parallel park!
This could be in a museum some day! It's not safe with me! It should really be in a doormanned building.
The last time I saw her, she was naked.
I believe you cut me off, and then made an obscene gesture.
I'm just sayin' I wanna have some fun.
Oh, yeah I'm sure he loves to hear from fans in the locker room.
OK, ah.. (George throws his keys on the table) see ya!
I could never do that. You know the ironic thing is if she had a smaller nose, I never could have gone out with her in the first place. She'd be out of my league with a smaller nose. And I really like her, I know that. And I know one other thing. I'm not getting past that nose.
Well Dad's been planning this for such a long time, he bought a new blanket, and he got tha...that game with foam paddles and the velcro ball. (laughs)
Y'know there are tribes in Indonesia where if you keep your coat on in somebody's house, the families go to war!
Hunh, pph (raises hands slightly, in amazement) How was it?
What do you mean not goin'? Come on, we got plans here. Call her up.
And I cancelled plans to go to the movies with them tonight.
Tell me your impressions, I would love to hear what a young woman thinks of "The Big Game".
So I'm sure whatever germs it landed on were knocked out, and by the time the rest of them realised what was going on, you had already grabbed it out.
No (snorts - Laughing nervously)... I'm gonna wear black shoes.
I just want the both of you to know how much you mean to me, and I love you both very, very much.
Well, I'm just expressing my gratitude to our gracious host.
These old guys, they're up at 4 a.m., by two thirty they're wiped. (animated) How did we get back onto you?!
What are you doing here, I though you were going to the airport.
Jerry, it's me, George, don't worry, I'll return it
I can't take it anymore! I'm going to work! ARe you happy now?! (Gathers his things, and runs out of the coffee shop. Elaine and Jerry laugh hysterically)
I needed it! My back is... a little tweaked.
Oh Shut up! What are you doing back so soon, anyway? (puts the tape back in it's case.)
(shouts) Wait! Yes! That's what I should've said! (frustration) D'ohh!
Hey, grown-up. (they both chuckle, George notices Gwen enter the room) Oh my god, there she is. Go ahead, go ahead. (to the others) Let's go, let's go. All right what are they saying?
Yeah. There's something wrong with that? I'm a character. People are always saying to me, "You know you're a quite a character."
(jokingly) Well, so, legally, I could marry your daughter.
Oh, there's a soup stand, Kramer's been going there.
Look at where we are! (referring to the seat usher) He's not stopping! He just keeps going and going and going! (the usher abruptly stops at the second row) We're not in the first row?
(Inquiring about the chalk board) What is this?
No Don't get the camera , we don't need the camera. Listen I know your skeptical , but I really believe in the Chinese.
Well, not recently. I craved. I crave all the time, constant craving...but I haven't yearned.
(clipping on shades) Ha.. She'll have to find me first. (leaving)
(swerving) Hey! Watch it! Did you see that guy? He just gave me the finger!
That's... what we used to call him in high school, the exterminator. He's a linebacker. Oh, did we have some wild times.
(pauses to consider this then gives in) All right. (starts heading towards bedroom)
Dollar Eighty-Nine. Why is this a dollar eighty-nine? Why is there no haggling in this country?
Hello? I can take an hour off your hands. Give the kids a chance to see a real live Yankee.
Oh, you're fine... you're fine. (looking at Tom in the back and then quieter to Jerry) So you think this guy playing Kramer took the raisins?
Oh, deserve! I don't know if I deserve...I mean...
Good afternoon. One large crab bisque to go. Bread. Beautiful.
You know, my mother used to walk around on our apartment just in her bra and panties. She didn't look anything like you, she was really disgusting, really bad body. If you could imagine uglier and fatter version of Shirley Booth. Remember Shirley Booth from Hazel. Really embarrassing, cause you know I had only mother in the whole neighborhood who was worse looking than Hazel. Imagine the taunts I would hear.
Yeah, but nothing happens on the show. You see, it's just like life. You know, you eat, you go shopping, you read.. You eat, you read, You go shopping.
You're Murphy!! Look, let's just jump out of the car.
I'm baby-sitting! Vivian asked me to raise him if she doesn't make it.
Alright, fine.I'll drive the 3 hours each way, 6 hours all together, and take 'em off myself!!
I believe strongly in that as you know.
I'm trying to get out of this Big Brother program. So when you get to Paris (handing Morty the postcards) all you have to do is drop 'em in any mailbox.
Cmon, go for twenty-five hundred. Well do it together. Come on, come on. Were in it together.
(Muttering) Susan has the doll collection.. one of the dolls looks exactly like my mother.. she likes to sleep with it.
(shifty, avoiding Jerry's eyes) Fine, fine. (he removes his coat)
You know, all these years, I've always wanted to see the two of you get back together.
Let me ask you something. When you go into a store, does it bother you that they make the security guard just stand there all day?
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I used to come here all the time with my fiance, back when it was a meat-packing plant. Ha. Here's her picture. (hands her a magazine page)
Oh, my God, No, oh my God, . . . Jerry!
You know what I think? I bet she stole a tractor.
Yeah, tell im. But quickly, Im double parked here.
They got a new intern from Francis Louis High. His name is Keith. He comes in Mondays after school.
Ha Haaaaaaa... Jerry how do you like that.You see I get myself in a dizzy, I'm all worked up and for what?
I've had bedroom naked, I've had walk-to-the-bathroom naked... I have never had living-room naked.
I cant believe how easy it is. Im virtually Orthodox. All I have to do is read a few books, memorize a few prayers, and Im in the club.
Aah! the minute I saw this girl, we just clicked. She's got such a nice face. hummmm her eyes, her mouth, nose
All right Mrs. S. I and my good pal Keith Hernandez will be right back.
Well, you know. You get to a certain point, you wanna know about your roots.
It's a spanish dish. It's a moulage of fish, an meat with rice. Very tasty.
I noticed you eh, chose the eh "clowns with balloons" check design.
Uh, excuse me, uh, um, Jason. I don't want to get into a big thing here, but... I'm not sure if, technically, what you just said was actually an apology.
George.. (She doesn't seem to recognize him) George Costanza.
I'm not through here, Jerry. (Picks up the model of the conference room.) I'm gonna keep on investigating. This thing is like an onion. The more layers you peel, the more it stinks. (Pam enters, George leaves.)
Oh, yeah, right. I wish I had something on my mind. (pregnant pause) So how about that Kramer, huh?
One of your guys - Kip, or Ned, short name - stole my Twix candy bar!
Thank you Mr.Farkus, thank you very much indeed sir.
What did I get the veggie burger for? You got a veggie burger, so I had to get the veggie burger, I'm allover crums...
(embarrassed with a touch of unrestrained jubilation) Yes.
Alright, alright! (Goes out onto the sidewalk. The Seinfelds walk by) Seinfelds!
(wiping the area with a hand) People think they're so important...
This is incredible! This is one of the greatest things I've ever done in my life! I'm gonna call my mother.
There's no house! It's a lie! There's no solarium. There's no Prickly Pete. There's no other solarium.
Well, here you go. What do you think?
Kramer, what the hell are you talking about?
Alright that's it. (George walks across the room over to them.) So you get rid of me and now the two of you are going to sleep together?
Because ballpark food doesn't count as real food.
Yeah, yeah. I see the irony. All right. What about this? What if I can find some way to break up with her so that she'll still like me and it doesn't affect the deal.
I don't know where you're getting this from. I....you're serious aren't you? Oh, (laughing) you see? You see, you just don't know my sense of humor. Dan, don't I joke around all the time?
(singing as he exits florist with bouquet and a cup of coffee) "...tootsie, good-bye. Too-too, tootsie..." (takes a drink, makes a face, shouts back at shop) You call this coffee? (dumps out coffee behind him, accidentally hitting a parked car's windshield)
Yeah, sure. I was showing a condo on 48th street. Besides, you think I wanna miss this? (chuckles)
The catering hall screwed up. The wedding is delayed until June. It's like a stay of execution.
I don't know, it sounds like pigeons or something!
Personally I'm a little nervous about going through these things. I'm afraid I'm gonna step through into another dimension.
I couldn't. You know, if it's not about sports, I find it very hard to concentrate.
I'm not paying $500 for this! It's a piece of junk!
(fever pitch) Marisa Tomei's sitting home, Elaine! Wh..why didn't you tell me that Katy was friends with Marisa Tomei?!
You know they used to make leisure suits out of this fabric?
Well anyway, the, uh... the stone is up, I paid my respects, guess that's it.
So I'm dressing and she's staring up at me, struggling to compute this unprecedented turn of events. I don't know what to say to reassure this woman, and worst of all, I don't have the time to say it. The only excuse she might possibly have accepted is if I told her I am in reality Batman, and I'm very sorry, I just saw the Bat-Signal. It took me 3 days of phone calls to get her to agree to see me again. Now she's waiting for me to call her, and she's
I couldn't help it! Elaine moved the mirror, I got discombobulated.
Are there terrorists on the plane? A hotel fire. Is that it? Malaria? Yellow fever? Lupus? Is it Lupus?
Is-is that what I said 'no story'? Because Jerry had to tell me later.
Eh, gee, I hope you have the key for these things.
He's a sports writer for the daily news. I find him very insightful...
You got less than sixty seconds. That's like dismantling a time bomb. What got into you?
In the whole world right now, there's maybe three emergencies. Why would you think, on this entire planet, that you're one of those three?
Yeah. I don't think they'll be able to tell.
Ok, we got your...got your strawberries, your chocolate sauce, your pastrami on rye with mustard, your honey...
Did you see the homeless guy on the library steps screaming obsenities and doing some calesthetics routine
That's a lot of pressure. Make love to me. What am I, in the circus? What if I can't deliver?
(adamant) It's not cheating if there's no sex!
Oh, its from Les Miserables. I went to see it last week. I cant get it out of my head. I just keep singing it over and over. It just comes out. I have no control over it. Im singin it on elevators, buses. Im singin it in front of clients. Its taken over my life.
I didn't do it! It..It just got done. I don't know how it got done, but it did.
Well why don't you get a hold of it and change what you don't like.
I'll tell you what, why don't you read this book and let's just see if you can explain it to me.
Well take a look. It might not even belong to her.
He's coming up?! (Moves to the door) I'll check you out later.
All right, I made up the part about the car, but the rest is true. And he hated me anyway!
I had to say something. (chuckles) I had to say something. Everything was going so well. I had to say something.
Coffees coffee in the morning. Its not coffee at twelve oclock at night.
Why do they have to do that in front of people?
Yeah, is he still mad at you for crashing his Thanksgiving party?
(Muttering out, not really wanting to talk about his family) When the Costanzas came here, one brother stayed behind.
Yes he is. Let me ask you something. When you come out of the shower and you put your robe on, do you cinch it real tight, are you concerned about that?
Yeah, I think I got a touch of something, too.
Can you believe it? It's happening! It's finally happening! I'm free!!
(energetically) "Well seems it's about time for George's lunch."
Aw right YES! GUM! Good enough I'll take it.
I know someone wholl do it. Shes good. Shes honest.
You can do better than me. You could throw a dart out the window and hit someone better than me. I'm no good!
Well, I'm sorry, Timmy...but I don't dip that way. (takes a chip.)
I don't know, she lives right around the corner. You could take it here or go to the coffee shop.
Well who schedules his wedding on Super Bowl Sunday?
So, he's keeping the apartment. He doesn't deserve it, though! Even if he did suffer, that was, like, 40 years ago! What has he been doing lately?! I've been suffering for the past 30 years up to and including yesterday!
That?s not the issue, we're friends, if I?ve got to be uncomfortable, you've got to be uncomfortable too!
They're reorganizing the staff, and I'm on thin ice with this guy as it is.
..And I went down there one time to see...
He still wins but it's not a blowout.
"Argh!!..Anyway...Jimmy couldn't be here today so he asked me to fill in for him, and I'm sure that you'll be impressed at what can be accomplished after only a few short days of training.....yeah!"
I'm not getting on a regular plane now - I'm all psyched up to go on a private jet. No way I'm getting on a regular plane.
You've still got pretty good coverage. Once the enemy advances beyond this perimeter - (points at Kurt's head with a pen) - then you won't be Kurt anymore.
(Trying to whisper to Jerry) Look, we are gonna settle this right now! I demand reparations! I should get to sleep with Elaine. That's the only way to punish you!
I was all primed for the first row; I was gonna put my feet up on the dugout!
The doctors thought he had cancer, but the surgery revealed he never actually had it.
I was so shocked I was lucky I said anything.
Shhh What is wrong with you? You never tell 'em you like the car. (Advising) You're not sure what you want. You don't even know why you're here.
Why did you give him my ticket for?
Let me ask you something. What do you think of this shirt?
The nickname. George. What is that? It's nothing. It's got no snap, no zip. I need a nickname that makes people light up.
(sets down his paper) So how were the eggs?
No, but um I have very good report with women, very good, comfortable. And from the first time I laid eyes on a brassieres, I was enthralled.
God! She's cooking dinner for God! She's yelling and screaming, and the next thing I know, she throws a big can of chocolate syrup all over my new red shirt.
Sir, I'm sure it's not a police matter.
Wait, wait a second, what are you doing?
I know that's why I bought `em but they're not comfortable.
(Sheepishly to Elaine) I'll be right back. (Leaves)
Oh, it was. But he claimed it was a 5th Avenue bar.
Not really. Your voice kind of raises to this comedic pitch. (Kramer enters)
No! (The salesman walks away. He addresses the mechanic through the doors window) Hey! Hey! I see you! That is my Twix! (The mechanic eats the last of the Twix, obviously to make George even more angered. It works) Oh, ha, ha! Ho, ho!
Love to! (Cracks his knuckles, then winces under the pain)
I tell ya, I am hooked on these books on tape.
I like to stop at the duty free shop!
Whoa, look at this. This is a beautiful suit. Huh?
Guess who he put in charge of Fitted Hat Day? Me.
(on tape, singing) "Believe it or not, George, isn't at home, please leave a mes-saaage at the beep. I must be out or I'd pick up the pho-one. Where could I be? Believe it or not, I'm not hooome." (beep)
Oh, come on! You gotta get me over there!
Isn't polite to say Hello when somebody says hello?
Excuse me, uh I couldn't help but notice that you were looking in my direction.
Get a good night's sleep, alright fellas. (thumbs up) Big day tomorrow!
It's all departures. I see nothing but departures. (to the woman beside him) Do you know where the arrivals are?
Well, at least we know the prosthetic squirrel hips work ... sorry bout the set.
Demi (the "i" sounds like an "e")? I thought it was Demi?
Guys, hitting is not about muscle. It's simple physics. Calculate the velocity, v, in relation to the trajectory, t, in which g, gravity, of course remains a constant. (Hits a home run) It's not complicated.
Not that much. You know, they tend to shrink in the water.
If you don't mind, sir. I'll be here at 8.
Elaine, I once told a woman that I coined the phrase, "Pardon my French."
Just put it on! All right now, remember she had her nails done today so remark how you like the color. And if you need me you beep me, all right. Here you go, hey, hey, hey, hey...(sprays Binaca into Jerry's mouth.) Go get'em you're a tiger!
She might be leaving to work any minute.
It moved! It was imperceptible but I-I felt it.
Dad, you know what it takes to compete with Microsoft and IBM?
Y'know if the guy dies, the art could really be worth something...
I can't tell ya now , he's gonna be back in a ten seconds.
Look, I really appreciate your coming, but if you wouldn't mind - try not to say too much.
When are they gonna learn that any news about China is an instant page-turner? (seeing Jerry with a small black device) What's that?
I think it moved. Oh my god, I think it moved. Yeah, give me the big piece. I'll see you later.
(turning to each other) I dont know. Hes an importer.
I can't come out. They're standing right by the door. Throw it up!
I'll tell you what's wrong, a grown woman with a male roommate! It's unnatural, it's an abomination!
Let me tell you who did, uh, buy it...um we pitched this story to Russell Dalrymple, the president of NBC, and he ate it up with a spoon.
(animated) N..no, no. You can't leave me. (frantic) Marry me! I'll burn myself. I'll burn my parents!
Or maybe, she just wanted to go to the Tony's. I tell you what; you ask her out again. No Tony, just Jerry. That way you know it he was her dude or just some dude.
She's got everything, right? (counts on his fingers) She's intelligent, she's smart, she's got a great sense of humour.
Thinking? Nothing. What could I possibly be thinking?
Festivus, Sir. And, uh, I was afraid that I would be persecuted for my beliefs. They drove my family out of Bayside, Sir!
And then assuming the strike is resolved, on April 14th, we, ah, play the Angels. So lets clear a floor at the Anaheim Hotel.
So you could call a woman for a date, ask her if she's free for Dinner and a flamenco?
My car's totaled. It's all his fault and now, he has absolutely no money. There is no way that he can pay me. So the judge decrees that he becomes my butler.
No, and you weren't funny last night either. In fact, you got us both so depressed, she asked me to drive her home after dinner.
Let me show you something, take a look at this... (Another guy at the party interrupts.)
Oh, what? What? That? Are you kidding? I didn't quit. What? You took that seriously?
Why not? Pay is good. I got dental, private access to one of the great handicapped toilets in the city.
Yes, yes! The punishment should fit the crime.
Alright, I'll tell you the truth. I'm not gay. My name's Buck Naked, I'm a porno actor.
Which market, the, eh, big one, the big market, the big board. Bull market, bear market, you name the market, I'm there.
(Sarcastic) Maybe for her new performance piece she'll give birth on stage.
Look at this. There's no spaces here. (to another car) Excuse me, are you gettin' out?
I was supposed to see her. She wasn't supposed to see me.
Kramer, I cant believe it. Oh, youre my hero!
She's too tanned. It's the middle of the winter, she's like a carrot.
Maybe you don't have to be so funny. I mean, would it kill you not to be so funny all the time? That's all I'm asking. This woman thinks I'm very funny. Now you're gonna be funny, so what am I gonna be? I'm gonna be a short bald guy with glasses who suddenly doesn't seem so funny.
Oh yeah. So wait, wait. A half-hour later Im back in the office, I tell Lloyd the whole story. He says, So why dont you call her? I says, I cant. I couldnt, I couldnt do it right then. For me to ask a woman out I gotta get into a mental state like the karate guys before they break the bricks. So Lloyd calls me a wuss.
She asked about me? What did- What did she say?
I did it. Hunh, we're going out as soon as she gets off of work and it'll still be daytime. You know I, Im much better in the daytime then I am at night. it's less pressure.
Ah, this is the kind of day that almost makes you feel good to be alive.
Its unbelievable. You know what else is unbelievable? I picked up the check. She didnt even offer. She ended it. The least she could do is send me off with a sandwich.
I heard the last guy got fired because his nose whislted.
Dad, you really should lay off the 'serenity now' stuff.
Yeah, I thought I might give her a call. I, I don't meet that many women. I meet like three women a year. I mean, we've been introduced. She knows my name.
Well if you didn't think I was parking, why did you put it in head first?
'Why don't I rent the movie.' See, this is when I like you. Alright, now I'm relieved. (Kramer enters and comes over to the booth.)
You know, about the uh, two of us getting together. And I know that I said I was engaged, but (laughs) uh, you know, it's really just something you say. It's like, going steady. You know uh, going steady, engaged, it's, it's all just stuff you say. (chuckles) Anyway, I was watching uh, My Cousin Vinnie, on the uh, on the tape the other day, and I was thinking that uh, you know, the two of us might take a meeting, as they say. (chuckles) So, what d'you, what d'you think?
(To Jerry) Let me ask you something.. How much do you think it would cost to have tonsils and adenoids removed in the hospital?
Yo, dad. This is my boss, Mr. Kruger.
Wow,  god! You see this is all I think about. Sleeping with a giant. It's my life's ambition.
A woman that hates me this much comes along once in a lifetime.
It strikes me a lot of guys are doing that kind of humor now.
... She's got it stashed away in there somewhere.
Ha Ho! (he turns and walks out the door)
Psh. What's the point of even discussing it? [condescendingly takes her hand and pats it] You'll give me the money when you have it. [takes two steps, then reconsiders, then re-reconsiders] I, I trust you.
So in order to use these, I gotta spend like fifteen-hundred bucks. This is a bill for fifteen-hundred dollars. Plus, she'd ask about the sleeping arrangements, that whole sleeping arrangement conversation is depressing.
I was handcuffed to the bed.. In my underwear, (Sighs) where I remained.. (Scene cuts to another story) She was attractive.. She was, also, infact, a Nazi.. (Cuts to another story) The water.. that I had been swiming in was.. very cold. And, when I dropped the towel, there was.. significant shrinkage.. (Scene cuts to, yet, another story) Her parents were looking at me.. So, there I was, with a marble rye hanging from the end of a fishing pole.. (Scene cuts to his closing statements) In closing, these stories have not been embellished, because - they need no embellishment. They are simply, horrifyingly, the story of my life as a short, stocky, slow witted bald man. (Gets up) Thank you. (Every memeber of the board shows some sign that George's story is most deserving of the apartment. Ricardi is crying. George turns to leave, then remembers one more thing..) Oh, also.. my fiance died from licking toxic envelopes that I picked out. (Sobs and loud crying erupts from the board members) Thanks again. (Leaves. Eldridge looks defeated)
Alright, alright, I'll go on the date, but that's that.
How would you like a 'Hare Krishna' fist on your throat, you little punk?
Just as she was. Hey, Mario! Remember us?
They're all the same. You go, you sit, you eat popcorn, you watch. I'm sick of it.
Well, then, I am gonna have to ask you to turn your key.
A garden! I cant believe theres a garden!
Maybe I need someone who doesn't speak English.
I just don't like the idea that any time theres a dinner invitation there's this annoying little chore that goes along with it.
Hey, you know, there's this secretary at work that always had a crush on me.
Why'd you pick Hoover? Was he that interesting to talk to?
I know a little. Besides, what do you have to know?
You know, anything in the, in the lip area is good.
Pretend you didn't know it was there. Can you see it?
Well it's not my fault. Seinfeld can't drive. How hard is it to follow somebody?
ho ho ho ho. You know I only got two weeks left of unemployment. I got to prove I've been looking for a job to get an extension
(looks back to the group) I can read lips. You said let's sleep together.
And isn't it more fun using the urinal?
Anyway, I think everything else is okay. Unless of course she's faking.
Who's dressing you? (Laughs) You look like a complete idiot! You know, I wouldn't wipe my- (Unable to take anymore, Leslie gets up and shoves George violently. His hands go straight for the hot iron sitting on the dressing room table. George screams out in agony) AAHHHH!!!!! (his voice is heard outside the building, on the street, and in the park were a bunch of pigeons are scared by the yelling)
This is a huge project involving lots of numbers and papers and folders.
I need a break, Jerry, you know. I gotta get out of the city. I feel so cramped...
You know what? It doesn't matter, because I quit!
Uh, excuse me. Uh, pound of Arabian mocha java, please.
I can do six weeks standin' on my head. I'm a sexual camel. That's not the point. At least there was the possibility.
I don't know of this is the house. I don't see Jerry's car anywhere.
[furious] Good. It's good to be accurate like that.
We should have left earlier. I told you.
(standing) Oh yeah, Reilly? (smugly) Well, the jerk store called. They're running outta you
Yes, yes of course. The Pensky file. Ho ho, can't wait to sink my teeth into that. Wow that Pensky. Well we'll straighten him out.
I understand you offer a 50%-off 'bereavement' fare...?
I told you, I told you! Ha ha ha! Ooh ooh!
If anybody should be getting more it's you.
Because my parents happen to be two pretty wonderful people.
We had an incredible phone conversation. We talked for like twenty minutes. I threw away my notes in the middle of the call. You know, I thought she had a great voice timbre. Is it timbre or tamber?
So, I'm gonna steal another one, and then return it. That way, everything is even.
You know what you oughta do. You should go to her office and heckle her.
Uh, Jerry, you want your blankets tucked in?
You would think that at the end of the week when they hand out the checks, throw in a few soaps.
Do you ever just get down on your knees and thank god that you know me and have access to my dementia?
Oh, yes. I already packed up my desk, sir. I can be outta here in an hour.
Lemme tell you something, that Jerry Lewis? You wonder how some of these people get to the top? It's ideas like this! Brilliant! Hah-hah! (Notices that the briefcase is damaged.) Look at this - what the hell happened? The whole side is damaged here...and the lock is broken.
I suppose I could just pull this out ( his tucked shirt)and walk around like this and you wouldn't care?
You would not believe what just happened. I was waiting for you and this woman was sitting at the counter.
No. I need a guy that can rig a Frogger machine so that I can move it without losing power, 'cause I have the high score. H-hello?
Yes, well, I sat down with Mr. Steinbrenner. I told him you have been doing great work. I said that you deserved a raise, and if you didnt get it, that I, was leaving. (motions with both arms in a circular motion to his right)
You know, you know what's great about our relationship?...It's not about looks.
Well, Jerry, I been thinkin'. I've gotten as far as I can go with George Costanza.
. . . WELL IT WAS A BIG SALAD. AND WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IS, HOW DOES A PERSON WHO HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE BIG SALAD CLAIM RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT SALAD AND ACCEPT THE THANK YOU UNDER FALSE PRETENSES - AH - AH?
And now for the trifecta. (Picks up a hand held TV and gets back under the covers.)
I don't even think she'd notice it. Can you see it?
Besides, what's it gonna cost me? Thirty-eight bucks?
One mile from the exit it starts shaking, really violently shaking, like it's having a nervous breakdown. It completely stopped dead.
You know how hot it gets there? Like 150 degrees. Your skin is gonna be simmering with boils.
Yeah. I love Hampton tomatoes. You know, you can eat 'em like apples. You know it's funny, the tomato never really took on as a hand fruit.
You never run out, do you? (Jerry smiles.) Where's Kramer? Everything's finished here.
Or, I could take the twenty, then I could pay *you* later.
Have you ever given your code to anyone?
Don't you see. She's looking at my pictures.
I know. And now they want me to bottle it up. It makes me so mad!
Alright, now. What mood am I in, what mood am I in?
Oh my god, maybe Gwen saw it. Maybe that's what did it.
S, uh, Superman - he, uh, built the fortress of solitude up at the North Pole, to, uh, you know, sort of get away from it all..
Hey, what happened with Sandy. I forgot all about it. Did you call her?
Wednesday? That's your personal business?! (stalks over to the counter) Skiing?! (angry) So let people suffer, while you're shushing all over a mountain?
Oh! Nuts! Excellent! You know what I love? How there's two nuts named after people. Hazel...and filbert.
Well, I was very comfortable! I've got my nuts here...
Could you make it two-twenty-five that was his hi-game in bowling.
Have you seen the new addition to the Guggenheim?
But Mr. Cantwell, you... you owe me for the soup...
(picking up what Frank saw as a mouse) It's the remote.
(anger) Well now it's not gonna be original! It's gonna lose all its cachet!
Because the underwear is pulled up from the back and ... it wedges in..
No. I am not giving my code to anyone for any reason.
There she is. (waiving his arms quickly above the table - to nix the conversation) No no no no no no.
Mrs. Sweedler thank you. Y-You see, this tragedy affected me in a very, very personal way.
Well, she doesn't really want to see Firestorm.
And I didnt even ask her out. She asked me out first. She called me up. What was I supposed to do? Say no? (laughs) I cant do that to someone.
By the way, you owe me seven fifty.
(frantic) Jerry! Jerry, muh--muh--my hair-dryer ruined the picture! An' I need another one or I can't get back into the forbidden city!
(Not really wanting to embellish) ..I stopped by the house to drop the car off, and I went inside for a few minutes.. Nobody was there - they're supposed to be working. (Jerry and Elaine look at each other - enjoying the story) My mother had a Glamour magazine, I started leafing through it..
(frustrated) No. No, no, no. You're not helping me.
Hey, at least I was a camp waiter.
These are the balloons? Big deal, all I see is Woody Woodpecker.
We, uh, we go on foot from here.
(positive) Yes. From endorsing checks for the Super Terrific Happy Hour. (laughs)
Alrighty, so. That's one tuck and one no-tuck. Got that?
Well she apologized, and then she wanted to know if we could get together Wednesday afternoon.
On an elevator? You met a woman on an elevator?
Eh, but, you know, Mr. Ross, if - if you look at the whole situating, what with it being your cigars, and everything, it's really rather ironic - one might even say, in a sense, comical.. (Mr. Ross has, by now, left the room. Mrs. Ross is pointing at George, nodding, laughing. As if to say he hit the bullseye. George calls out to Mr. Ross) Really. Think about it.
(grabbing his jacket) Hey oo, I just remembered uh my parents really wanna have you guys over for dinner before you leave town. What about tonight?
Y'know the average life span for an American male is like, 72. You're really... kinda pushin' the envelope there.
Me either. Is there anything you can do to shut them up?
Don't you see. Women like that are like, members of a secret tribe living in a forbidden city. People like me have not been inside in thousands of years.. But with this, it's like I've already been with one of her own! My hands been stamped! I come and go as I please!
No...no...no, I hate to tell you this. Youre not gonna see this woman.
(Defensively) He knows how to read. And he also knows finishing an entire book doesn't prove anything. And get this he's into architecture.
Well, you know, it's really very funny, because you know what we got here, really? We really, really, just have a terrible misunderstanding. You see, when I passed on the deal, I thought that's what Jerry wanted me to say. Y'know, I, I misinterpreted.
He mentioned my name?! What did he say?!
Well I'm not starting up a whole new wardrobe now!!!
They're not mocked and humiliated when they get to the other side.
That's okay. That's good. You think Louie Pasteur and his wife had anything in common? He was in the fields all day with the cows, you know with the milk, examining the milk, delving into milk, consummed with milk. Pasteurization, Homogenization, She was in the kitchen killing cockroaches with a boot on each hand.
Look, I'm doing you a favor. They're having an unadvertised sale. This suit is gonna be half-priced starting ... Monday.
Well, you know, I've been lyin' about my income for a few years. I figured I could afford a fake house in the Hamptons.
(Takes a sip) Hey, it's not too bad..
It's a pot pourri. May I, uh, may I show you the master bedroom? (they leave together)
Oh come on? No come on. She took off her hat and there she was (waving his hand over his head) hello. It was like I was looking at myself in the mirror.
(pause) Dad! I heard you were in the city the other day!
You came to see me. I work in the building.
(Showing Jerry up) Listen carefully. My mother has never laughed. Ever. Not a giggle, not a chuckle, not a tee-hee.. never went 'Ha!'
Who am I going to meet who is better than her? No one, Jerry. No one's better than her.
(to the waitress bringing his doughnut) And a slice of devil's food cake.
Only if you buy. I gotta make a sale.
Of course. But I really wanna leave my mark this time, you know, uh. I wanna walk away from the Yankees with people saying 'Wow! Now that guy got canned!'
This is amazing. (George gets up to leave and shake's man's hand) Thank you. Thank you very much. . . . I'm going back in! . . . You'll feel better (to woman)
Tell me about it. I went out with this girl last week. First I had to pay for dinner, then--
I'm not stealing it. They owe me ten dollars. They stole from me.
I'm against all "it's me"s. So self-absorbed and egotistical, it's like those hip musicians with their complicated shoes!
So how do you want to do this?
Hey, what about this? I'm in a car accident. The motorist is uninsured, you with me?
A little notice would've helped! How many people?
I got to get downtown and buy that suit. The store opens in twenty minutes.
I am never saying 'I love you' again unless they say it first.
"Well...there's no room for someone like that in this organization."
You know my driver's waiting, I really should get running. Good to see you guys again.
Well you know what I've discovered Mrs. Sokol. It's not so much the looking as the listening. I listen for work. And as I'm looking and listening I am also looking. You can't discount looking. It's sort of a combination. It's looking, and listening, listening and looking. But you must look.
Pick up the phone, Elaine. Pick it up!
Its a Twix! Theyre all Twix! It was a setup! A setup, I tell ya! And youve robbed it! Youve all screwed me again! Now, gimme one! Gimme a Twix!
Oh, I dont get the enthusiastic hi, Im outta there.
What happened to the pact? We were both gonna change. We shook hands on a pact. Did you not shake my hand on it uh?
Algae, obviously plankton, hmhm. I don't know what else I could tell ya, ah, Oh I-I just got back from a trip to the Galapagos Islands, I was living with the turtles.
You want to be with somebody that doesn't like you.
Do you know how much this is going to cost me?
I dunno, I'm in a limo. (dials) Hello ma? It's me. Guess where I am. In the back of a limo. No, nobody died. It's a long story, I can't tell you now. Because I can't. I said I can't. If I could, I would. Would you stop it? Alright, look, I'm getting off. No, I'm not telling you! How's this? I'm *never* telling you! I don't care! No! Fine! Never!!
Snoopy and Prickly Pete. Should I keep driving?
(Mr.Wilhelm comes in and hears George yelling) You tell that son of a bitch no Yankee is ever comin' to Houston! Not as long as you bastards are running things!
That's really very nice of you, Eva. Thank you.
Oh ho! Class, huh? At Columbia? Let me tell you something, pal. I called the registrars office. I checked you out. They have no record of a Ray Thomas at that school! You liar!
Well...maybe not as much as this bastard... (points at Zeke, they all laugh) I can hold my own! (they all continue laughing and drinking)
No. Nothing. Fine. (he sits at the table)
You want me to ask one of the Yankees.
51 people?! That's it?! I thought it was, like, a thousand!
Well, we were engaged to be married, uh, we bought the wedding invitations, and, uh, yada yada yada, I'm still single.
Hey, thanks. I owe you a big one.
And you know what else I've decided to do? I'm going to keep seeing the bald woman.
Why not? It's a good look for a woman.
Okay, Okay. Who do you think you're talking to? What are ya' you trying to make a joke, because it's not funny. I can tell you that.
You know, this is very nice, but I really could take a cab. Really.
Excuse me, I've got a maniac stalking me, I'm not staying in the city.
It's Allison. I dated her right after you. She's obsessed with me.
. . .uh, . . . wait a second. Are you suggesting that I went out of my way to tell Elaine that even though you handed her the big salad, that it came from me?
(Stuttering) I, I, I, .. here, let me - let me help you..
Well, it always has to be explained to me, and then I have to have someone explain the explanation.
When Lupe makes up the beds in the morning.
What am I talking about? Come on. (laughing) You don't think I bought all that? (does a little move)
(On his way out) Heh, heh, heh. Thats what they want you to think.
Where are you meeting these women? When they get off the bus at the port authority?
I don't think I could do it. You know, they always remember the first time. I don't want to be remembered. I wanna be forgotten.
(Looks fed up with his parents) Oh my God..
My father had a car salesman buddy. He was gonna fix him up real nice. Next thing I know, Im gettin dropped of in a Le Car with a fabric sunroof. All the kids are shoutin at me, "Hey, Le George! Bonjour, Le George! Lets stuff Le George in Le Locker!"
(reading the tabs) Jerry, yours is eleven dollars.
(Still on the hot water) What about shaving?
That?s-that?s-Harry Fong, he's a very good friend of mine and he's a big opera buff. Enjoy the show there harry!... You know what.
(laughing it off and trying too hard) Yeah, yeah. I have a thing for Marisa Tomei. Like she would ever go out with a short, stocky, bald man. (forced laughter) Hu hu, ha ha. Like that's her type. Huh. She's an Oscar winner. (nervous laughter) He heh. Besides, I don't even know her. It's not like anyone's trying to fix us up. Who, who would try and fix me up with Marisa Tomei?
I tried! I almost threw it down the incinerator, but I couldn't do it. The guilt was too overwhelming. (Grabs the doll, opening the door to leave) Susan's so attached to this thing.
Is he a clown? What, are you kidding me!?
It's break up by association. Besides, she's mad at me anyway because of my birthday present.
Let me just see it for a second.
I mean, we're not stupid, right? We know when something's funny!
Maybe the baby would like to see my spot. A positive, uplifting message to start his life out with. Huh, You can still get a great space in this city - if you apply yourself.
Ahh! (closes his eyes and rolling his head back) Umh!
I know what you were trying to do. Nobody does it better than me.
Well you know there is an unusual number of people in this country having sex with AMPUTEES! (grabs the forum from Kramer and walks over to the clerk) . . . Penthouse forum, newspaper, gum, Clark Bar.
Yeah, and you were engaged for like a minute, I was engaged for a year.
I really don't think we're supposed to be talkin' about this.
Ah, see, Mister.. I didn't write that report. That, that's not mine.
Yeah, yeah, and we started talking, and she's this lawyer who's incredible! Everything I said was funny! You know, she laughed at everything I said, she thinks I'm hilarious. You know in a way, it was almost too good. I started so good, I can't go any place but down now, ya know? I got no place to go.
'Cause believe me, I would only say this to you and maybe a psychiatrist, maybe. Well, her nose is a little big.
(Again, sarcastic) Oh, what a huge blow to the culture.
We were expecting about two hundred people...Well...Thank you , thank you.
Well I was lost, I never saw the first one. By the way, you mind if I watch it here?
Ill tell you when it happened. When that floss came flying out of my pocket.
They always make me take stock of my life. And how Ive pretty much wasted all of it, and how I plan to continue wasting it.
I love this place. You know, Carl and I come here all the time.
Mind? Why would I mind? I would love to wait! (shakes hands with Nana) Nana, nice to see you. Ni-ni-ni-ni-NANA! (embraces another guest, kisses her) Aunt Phyllis, always a pleasure. What a pleasure! Hey, let's do this again real soon. I had fun, huh?
Well, I got just the thing to cheer you up. A computer! Huh? We can check porn, and stock quotes.
Jerry, I've been preparing for this moment my entire life.
Is that what's hurting your appreciation for the story?
I don't see how I could perform sexually in a situation after something like that. I was completely emasculated. Anyway, it's not the only reason.
No, no. No, no, no. (determined) We're staying on me. We haven't solved anything yet.
I am in and out of my personnel file at work all the time.
Yeah, well I'm thinking about getting out of town with Susan for a few days....Her parents rebuilt the cabin!
Well bear in mind that I am in the smaller office.
Maybe she moved it up in the rotation.
You should have somebody take a look at that.
(scoffs) Those unions. (sighs) Okay. Sports,...movies. What about a talk show host?
So let me ask you a question about the tip jar. I had a little thing with the calzone guy this week. I go to drop a buck in the tip jar and just as I am about to drop it in he looks the other way. And then when I am leaving he gives me this look think thanks for nothing. I mean if they don't notice it what's the point.
Yeah, yeah, not fan talk, not gushing, you know? Actual conversation, I was incredibly articulate!
Oh well, gracias El Commandante, gracias. Muy muy.
You arms look like something hanging in a kosher deli.
All right, believe me, you're not going to marry him.
(Laughs slightly) A physician married to a salesman. (Chuckles) Well, I gotta tell you, Beth, you coulda done a lot better than him.
Ah, would you take this picture away from me. Take it away and get it outta here. Let me just sign this and go.
look at this guy. Does he have to stretch in here?
I see, well, thats open to interpretation. Because so much depends on the layering and the quality of the wetness in the eyes.
No, they're not funny at all. No, I have no funny friends. I'm the funny one. El Clowno.
Lemme tell you sum'in. When Ponce looked in that mirror and saw that he hadn't changed, and that tear started to roll down his cheek? ... I lost it.
He asked me to keep it a secret.
It's fine, it doesn't have to be about nothing.
Because it's really a pretty good little story. Don't you think?
She called. He yelled Cartwright. I missed her.
I might tell her that I love her. I came this close last night, then I just chickened out.
They could kick me out of the health club if he tells them!
What are you gonna do with all of them?
I know but I couldn't think of anything else to say to her.
Ah! Some bald thing, a bald thing I dunno. It's nothing
Well, it's this little place with this little bathroom. It's like right there, you know, it's not even down a little hall or off in an alcove. You understand? There's no... buffer zone. So, we start to fool around, and it's the first time, and it's early in the going. And I begin to perceive this impending... intestinal requirement, whose needs are going to surpass by great lengths anything in the sexual realm. So I know I'm gonna have to stop. And as this is happening I'm thinking, even if I can somehow manage to momentarily... extricate myself from the proceedings and relieve this unstoppable force, I know that that bathroom is not gonna provide me with the privacy that I know I'm going to need...
Jerry, just remember. It's not a lie... if you believe it.
Fabulous, I'll think about that George, thank you!
They were in here, I saw her put 'em in here!
Well you didn't have to say it like that.
Who says you gotta have a story? Remember when we were waiting for, for that table in that Chinese restaurant that time? That could be a TV show.
Ah, well, that's very mature. What about you?
Well, I didn't want to break our date.
First class doesn't make it anymore. Now you get on the phone with Kimbrough, tell him what happened and tell him to get another plane down here, but this time, the good one - the Ted Danson plane.
But in the zoo, you know, they might, put a woman in there with me to uh.. you know, get me to mate.
They, uh... said you were with some guy who was wearing a cape?...
The second time I sent the noodles back, I tought she made a face...
Assistant to the General Manager!! Do you know what means?!? He'd could be askin' my advice on trades! Trades, Jerry, I'm a heartbeat away!
Sure. You know, Rhisa. I've always found you... very attractive.
Well, this is a lovely apartment. Lovely! My kids are gonna go crazy. I, uh, I wonder if I could see the bathrooms. Preferably one with some paint thinner and, uh, some rags?
You can't just walk into a building and say " I wanna be a talk show host."
Whooo.. (To a waitress taking orders) Ooh.. French fries.
(Suggesting) Maybe she's a nudist. You know, those nudist colony people..
He had a TV show! He had cartoons!
I dont know. All of em. Theyre all crooks! Besides, I couldnt get all different candy bars, anyway.
I know it's a doll, but it looks like my mother!
That's not the point. The point is I was here first.
Let's go, people, let's go! It's Prognosis Negative time, wa ha ha ha!!!
What, are you kidding? (Points at the flaws of Jerry's hands) The knuckles are all out of proportion. you got hair over there - where do you get off comparing your hands to my hands?! This is a one-in-a-million hand. (Points to his own hand)
First she screams, "George, what are you doing?! My God!" And it looked like she was gonna faint - she started clutching the wall, trying to hang onto it.
(Still focused on the nudist) They're naked, the gardeners naked.. the bellhops. (Jerry makes a noise of astonishment) One big nude-a-rama.
You can't - huhu, All right let's go.
You see? We were made for each other. (Thinking to himself) It's amazing. If I reach out and touch her breast right not, she'd scream and throw me out of the car. But at this time tomorrow, I could touch it all I want.
I know the D is the biggest. I've based my whole life on knowing that the D is the biggest.
No, but I can tell she's going to. I can sense it. We had this terrible phone conversation. I was so nervous before I called I made up this whole list of things to talk about.
[as if the word were totally foreign] My `stub'?
Again with the checked out. I'm not going to the doctor. If I don't to the doctor, then nothing will happen to me. If I go he might find something.
"What day is today?....Aw. ..Tuesday! Damn it. I shouldn't have worked out today. Mr Wilhem has called a big meeting and now I'm gonna be sweating through the whole thing."
I told her I was out o' soda, I went out to get some, an' I never went back.
What are you, Bud Abbott? What are you callin me an idiot?
It's not that easy. It's like "Beat The Clock," there's a lot of pressure there.
Of course, not as exciting as miss crop circles, but...
Well, we would like to be in business. Let's do business. We'll have some business. Let's have business.
(not happy delivering Elaine's lie) Well, he uh, he wants to uh, quit the exporting and uh, focus just on the importing. And it's a problem, because she thinks the exporting is as important as the importing.
So how long has it been in the basement?
Will I call you when I get home? ha ha What do you think? ee, you kill me kill me
How do you know? What if pig-man had a two-seater?
Oh hey, by the way. Do you want a box 'a, Cuban cigars? I smoked one last night. I got nauseous.
(melancholy) I wish that was all needed. Life can be so confusing. I..I'm searching for answers, anywhere.
People smoke, Elaine. My mother smoked. It didnt hurt me.
Quick. Get this thing back in the pizzeria
I got him Yankee's tickets! He got me a piece of paper saying "I've given your gift to someone else!"
Well, it's all for charity, so what's the difference.
Alright, very good, very good...go fold your little balloon animals, Eric. Eric! (chuckles) What kind of name is that for a clown, huh?
I hate this mall, there are never any spaces here...
No, no. No, no, no. It was not trash!
That's what nuns and Red Cross workers are for.
Oh ya, This is my fiance, Susan. This is David
I got it. Cups in the front, loops in the back. (puts the bra on the table)
Pretentious? Who, who isn't pretentious? Ha, ha, if everyone who was pretentious was in a mental institution, ... uh, obviously THIS isn't a mental institution.
You got a line in the Woody Allen movie?
I'll tell ya, if I ever get out of here, I'm gonna change my life. I'm gonna do a whole Zen thing. Take up yoga, meditate.. I'll eat right. Calm down, lose my anger.. (Sees Jerry and Elaine aren't listening. He snaps) Hey, is anybody listening?!
All right, I'm gonna find a guy with a truck. GLC must live on!
Im outta the picture. I am outta the picture. (laughs) Its only a matter of time now.
Or we don't even send the check and then when they call, we pretend we're the cleaning service. Heh heh. "Hello? I sorry, no here Kruger."
You wanted a Yankee, I got you a Yankee.
That's right. I got his whole car downstairs.
(back-pedalling) No, he, he didnt actually tell me that, uh, we were talking about that commercial  in fact I think I brought it up because I like that commercial. No, he, he would never tell me anything. He never discusses anything. Hes, hes like a clam. Youre not gonna mention this, to him...
Ladies. I, uh, I haven't seen this before.
You know, you could've just given me Neil's number. You..you didn't have to take me out to dinner.
See, I knew it. I knew this was gonna happen...
(walking towards the door) I couldn't leave well enough alone?!
Its amazing. We, we both have dates on the same night. I cant remember the last time that happened.
Ohooo what are we going to do? I'm shaking! I'm shaking!
What are we gonna tell Jerry about the car?
This is not about them. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to exercise Jerry's gaskets.
Just when I was doing great. I told you God wouldn't let me be successful.
Alright, listen, I'll give you your spare keys, but I don't have them with me. Can I please have mine to give to back to Kramer?
I was quoting him. Why would I be insulted? I'm never insulted. You could call me baldy, dump soup on my head. Nothing insults me.
Did I need that pointed out for me? What is that going to do for me? How does that help me, to see her? I'm trying to live my life. Don't show me that.
English. Does anybody speak English .Nobody speaks English.
I know, I know. Kind of a cute Nazi though.
(feeling awkward) Its uh, not bad, its comin along. Why? Did you need something.
What was that line again? Something about finding your way in a shadow?
This is a *great* idea! Here... use this one. I get frequent flyer miles with every purchase... Wait! Get two tickets. As long as your turning it in for a refund what's the difference? I'll get *double* the bonus miles.
How are we gonna get out of here? They'll kill us!
What do you mean? The engagement is off, we get the TV back. That's business.
I don't. Susan wants to have it out when Sally comes tomorrow.
(agitated) Alright, I gotta try and talk my mother into taking him off my hands.
(worked up) I'm aware! I'm aware!! But this is Marisa Tomei, Elaine. An Oscar winner! How can I live the rest of my life, knowing I coulda been with Marisa Tomei? She said I was just her type! She loves short, stocky, balding funny men!
Must be one of those rich, spoiled handicapped people, who didn't want to do any work, and just wanted to sit in her wheelchair and take it easy.
Oh yeah yeah, don't you know they used pastrami in that movie 9? weeks? Remember the pastrami scene?
Still, I bet when they gave him a plane, it was a lot nicer than this one.
Uh Jerry, how long will you be in there?
[pause] Would I like to come up? I would love to come up. I, I'm fighting not to. Fighting! Unfortunately I uh have to get an early start tomorrow. Gotta' get up and hit that pavement
Well, I shouldn't have to pay for it!
I, I think I made my point. I'm sorry if I was a little harsh.
Now, you see, I don't get that. We had a relaxed stimulating, great conversation, she doesn't mention it? Why doesn't she mention it?
Oh, no no no, I'm fine. Let me help you with these dishes, huh?
Cmon. Wilkinsons got millions invested in this stock. Its gone up three points since Ive been watching it.
I'd like to be able to get it out.
She had to be impressed by that conversation, had to! It was a great performance. I am unbelievable on the phone. On the date they should just have two phones on the table at the restaurant, done.
How would you find out something like that...wait a minute, what am I thinking? I've got the entire Yankee organization at my disposal.
I didnt know there was a fireplace. A fireplace, that's incredible.
Hey, hey. Kramer, what are you doing? You can't smoke in here.
(TO JERRY, SOMEWHAT IMPRESSED) A Red Chinese prison?
Huh. You must think Im pretty stupid. (The mechanic shoots him a look as if he cleary does think hes stupid) That was no 5th Avenue bar. I can see the crumb right there in the corner of your lip! Now, that-that-that is a cookie - and we all know that Twix is the only candy bar with the cookie crunch.
So what, they don?t have another plane? She couldn't take a bus?
Are you going to help me or not?
Yes, I know so. You happen to be a very eligible lesbian.
Oh... do I have to write him a note or something?
(almost gleeful) After Dinkins lost the election, he had a complete nervous breakdown. They had to lock him up.
Christie? That's the one you met in the antique store?
Officer, could I just explain something to you?
So we had a good time... the four of us.
"Arrrrrrgh!! .. It's George.. Oh! Sports wholesaler. yeah. yeah. .. thanks for calling back. No , no , no still got the shoes, still got the shoes. Lots of them. This is.. beautiful athletic gear."
You know, I think I'm a little bit scared of her. She's five-three, like a hundred pounds. I'm frightened to death of her.
I got a big problem here, Jerry. The tapes are worthless.
Hey, you gotta take a ride with me later. I borrowed my father's car. '68 GTO.
Its my money. What should I do? Throw it out the window? I know a guy who took his vacation on his change.
Oh, okay. (Starts to walk other way and then walks to their room and goes in)
Hey, I am not here for rage. I'm here for revenge.
We'll have 2 slices and 2 grape sodas.
(Getting up) You know what? Maybe I should take off.
And here's a roll that I think you may enjoy.
Yeah. I got 'em down to fifty bucks. I just have to do all the jackhammering myself.
Hey, maybe this cheating thing is what I could use to ditch Maura.
Jerry, I like being with her. Plus, I know where she is all the time. I have relatively no competition. An-and you know how you live in fear of the pop-in?
(Still on the showers) Can I use hot water on my face?
I'm unbelievable at spelling last names. Give me a last name.
Oh ya, like there's something wrong with saying 'God bless you'. I was raised to say 'God bless you'.
(laughs - hehe) Well, first, I'm brushing my teeth and this piece of apple-skin, that must have been lodged in there for days, comes loose.
I got another meeting with Reilly. A whole new audience, and I bet I can get him to try that line again.
(gets up to leave the table) HELLO!!! (angrily)
No I didn't mean to imply that you did. You're obviously a very well proportioned individual. I was just wondering, have they ever offered you a chair?
The cabin.. (Laughs nervously) Well.. (Pauses as he thinks of a way to break the news, then decides to pass it off) Susan?
Excuse me Ms. which street are we on?
You know Keith, what I've always wondered, with all these ball clubs flying around all season don't you think there would be a plane crash? ...
Elaine, I'm, I'm shocked. I'm shocked. Here I go out in the spirit of the season (Elaine looking like she's not buying a word of it) and spend all my savings to buy you the most beautiful Christmas sweater I have ever seen to show my appreciation to you at Christmas and this is the thanks that I get at Christmas.
Cops. I don't even care about cops. I wanna see more garbage men. It's much more important. All I wanna see are garbage trucks, garbage cans and garbage men. You're never gonna stop crime, we should at least be clean.
It was kinda fun. (Elaine gives Jerry a cold cloth for his jaw.) You know, maybe his name really is J-O-H-N, but he changed it to J-O-N for show business. Well, you know, J-O-N is a lot zippier.
What about a rec room? Huh? Or a community center.
Well I, uh, I'm not sure how you pronounce it or anything, but I, uh, I believe it's Mnage  Trois?
You remember my cousin Rhisa? I'm gonna date her.
I'm afraid I'm just not interested in how I present myself. If those kind of superficialities are important to you, this probably isn't gonna work.
Well, I don't see why if you have his, he should have yours.
What are you? Satan? I'm close to a job here. It's my second interview with them.
Well, I didn't think anyone would play it.
Ah, Pfft! What can you do? (looking at a tag on the suit) Is this the price tag?
(pauses for a few seconds) OK, I'm tellin' you right now - if your kiddin' around I'm not gonna be able to be your friend anymore. I'm serious about that. You got that.
Ok, fine. It's going to be very interesting, very interesting if they don't show up tonight. You know my mother made all this Paella.
Ever since I found out that you let that message on Jerry's tape recorder I...
(to Carrie) You know, you're really being very selfish. It would be nice if you would think of someone other than yourself every now and then!
What about the body, what kind of body?
Im not going with him. I dont even know the guy. (to the teller) Look, they did this for me before.
(very casual and raising his hand in the air) Yep. That's five!
What for? . I'll tell you what for.... for hair.
Alright, c'mon, scooch over. (Tries to squeeze into the corner seat of the couch and struggles with Remy. He spills his glass of grape juice all over the couch in the process.)
Did you ever go to a singles weekend in the Poconos?
"Jerry", oh my God. He wants to talk about "Jerry"?
Why? Maybe she liked me. I, I mean she was looking right at me. You know, I think she was impressed. You know, we had good eye contact the whole meeting.
All right. So let me ask you a question. Who was the man in the cape?
And so, for all these reasons, we are officially broken up. (shuts book and reaches for door) Thank you, (opens door) and good night.
Woah, back it up, back it up. Beep, beep, beep. Tractor story?
(broaching a subject) Hey mom. What kind of woman was grandma?
But your life is Peterman's. Now the bus tour, which is real, takes to places that, while they are real, they are not real in sense that they did not *really* happen to the *real* Peterman which is you.
I'm engaged to Mr. Ross' niece. I'm probably gonna be taking over this whole place someday so if I were you I would stay on my good side.
You know my last name is Costanza. That's Italian. So you and I are like country men. Pisano's!
(smiling) Listen, I..I..I don't mean to seem forward...
Well, you know, if I uh, wasn't engaged.
I have to say, as a glasses wearer I take exception to that. That's like me buying a wheelchair to cruise around in.
(smiling) Ho ho. Funny. Isn't he funny? Funny guy. Ha ha ha.
(to salesman) Well, maybe you could show me something else.
Shes a pig. The woman's a pig, what wrong with her--
Because you're a gymnastics teacher. It's only natural.
(Struggling) No, no, no, no. I can walk it off. It's a hundred and twenty degrees in here.. I'll sweat it out.
How much do you tip a chamber maid?
I got rejected by a bald woman. A bald woman rejected me. Heh, you like that one? A woman with no prospects and no *hair*, told me that I wasn't her type. Apparently *baldy* likes a slimmer guy.
Yeah, they're all through ruining my life. What the hell are they still doing here? Lemme see this pamphlet. Hm. All right, so I'll, uh, get back to you.
And she loved me. Hoo, ho, she really did.
Well, maybe she decided to celebrate her birthday on the Monday after the weekend.
(frustrated) Ohh, I wanted to see that. (waves his arms in frustration) Thanks. Thanks a lot.
(takes a large bite - with his mouth still full, his speech is muffled) Oh, this is fabulous.
Yeah. So what's going on? We're gonna shoot the pilot and then it's gonna be on TV the following week?
Did you see the way she pointed at the check? She gave me the finger.
No no, this is a matter of principle. That would just be saying that anybody could just pull into any parking space any way they want. Well I'm making a stand here. I'm saying *no* to head first parking. I'm not putting up with that. We put up with too much crap in this city, we're not putting up with head first parking.
Hey, so get this. I get a call this morning from one of the Mets front office guys. They wanna take me out to lunch.
At the funeral, give or take. You know, deep down, I always kinda felt that they blamed me for Susan's death.
(While skimming a Monk's menu) You know, I didn't go to the bathroom the entire time we were in India.
Thanks. You know this could sound crazy but, what do you think about adding a drawer for - like a blanket?
Eat me alive, huh? We'll see who can make it in *this* town.
You should've seen her face. It was the exact same look my father gave me when I told him I wanted to be a ventriloquist.
It's not a pet! It's a wild invalid! And it knows that I tried to kill it. As soon as it gets better, it's gonna gnaw my brain out in my sleep!
uh.. maana? huh maana might.. huh maana might be a problem, I'm supposed to have huh a boil lanced maana. Huh you know I think they charge me if I cancel with only one maana's notice
I know. Don't you see. (emphatic) He was doing it to fool Lloyd Braun!
Ben Cantwell. 85. Huh... You think we'll make it to that age?
Ah, I guess I should go up and apologize.
Susan! Jerry! Where are you? I know you're there! Answer me!
She probably never heard it. Don't you see what this means? It's like the whole thing never happened. It's like when Superman reversed the rotation of the earth to save Lois Lane!
You know, you're nuts with these sponges. George is gettin' frustrated!
Why should she like me? Who am I? Huh, there's a million people to like.
What is with this dog, I thought we were taking it to the pound.
(animated) Are you insane? Jerk store, woulda smoked that guy! Smoked him, I say.
(chases after her) Wait a minute! You're--now you're getting a divorce because she's from Long Island?!?!
Take toilet paper for example. Do you realize that toilet paper has not changed in my lifetime? It's just paper on a cardboard roll, that's it. And in ten thousand years, it will still be exactly the same because really, what else can they do?
What do think I tell Jerry everything? It's not like he's my wife.
(opening door) It's a big night. I'm, uh, ice skating with one, and going to a staged reading of "Godspell" with the other.
(to Kramer) Ah! You're just the man I'm looking for.
(pointedly) Oh, I'm sorry, I require twenty-four hours notice for a cancellation. Now, as I see it, you owe me seventy-five dollars.
(grateful, relieved) Thank you! I'm gonna make you both so happy!
So, um, you've read "The Big Game", have you?
So what? Ill start talking to him, you know, casual, and Ill work my way around to it.
(yells) Wow! Who put this cup right on the new table!
I though we said we weren't going to discuss that now!
I-I guess it can't hurt him... People eat *pounds* of those things.
But enough about fish, huhuhu. I can discuss other things you know, ah architecture. Huhu. (makes a wide gesture with his arms)
Wait a second. (George gets up and heads for the statue in Kramers hands.) I cant believe this! Let me see this.
He probably doesn't want to get chocolate on his fingers. That's the way these society types eat their candy bars.
No, it's doing the same thing to someone that they did to you.
Anyway, we met with NBC about a month ago and they gave us the green light to go ahead and write a pilot. In fact, we got a big meeting with them tomorrow. They gotta approve of the story before we can write.
Come on. We got all day tomorrow to come up with a story.
Oh, no, no, no...you sit right here...I will get you a nice snack.
Alright, now the play is tomorrow night. So do you want to have dinner first, or do you just want to meet at the theatre?
(to himself, resentful) What kind of a snobby, stuck-up, cult is this?!
You might want to try it...makes the movie more enjoyable, that's all.
Because my cousin's imbecile dog was rolling around outside and they got in his carpet.
(Looks at her) Yeah, uh, no menus. (Waves her off)
That doesn't explain the lipstick on the dashboard?
(Places the doll presumingly where it belongs on a shelf) Ya?
(with a mouth full of food) This is good. Oh, this is good.
I thought I saw something fly over here...
Well, Im going with him. Id like to... Ive never done a solid before.
Hey! Wow, the K-Man! (They walk into the kitchen inside)
Does she walk around holding a pen she never seems to need?
No. I like the ball! This is my One Chance to make a Great Entrance! My whole life! I have never made a great entrance!
Well ...... but how do I get someone else fired?
Would you excuse us for a minute Tim boy, we're kind of in the middle of something.
Alright, this is what ya gotta do I need ya to go out to the parking lot at Yankee Stadium, take the flyers off my car.
Here, just give me a couple of napkins.
Yeah, well...a little rough finding something good in your price-range. (to Jerry) But you, my friend, may be in luck.
Me Too! And he's Dying Jerry! If Relationship George walks through this door, he will Kill Independent George! A George, divided against itself, Cannot Stand!
Yeah, well I uh got lots of other stuff to show you too. Wait till you see the plum job that I landed.
Sure. I could go the tomato route. But eh, I've given this a lot of thought Jerry. All that frustration. Ill never get any work done. So Im doing a complete 360. Im going for total efficiency and ability.
This woman just set me up for a job!
(slightly worried) You know, I'm starting to get a little nervous about this lunch.
Um, excuse me, I - I think you forgot my bread.
Elaine...let me just explain something to you. See, this is not just a weekend routine...I'm on the verge of make-up sex here. You know about make-up sex?
You know, I don't see how you can sit there eating that and not even offer me any?
Is there any work being done? Is there any rubbing, touching, finger manipulation on the other person, and if so, who's making the request?
I just thought of a great name for myself, if I ever become a porno actor.
Yeah. What are you doing with the Daily Worker?
I--I've been, walkin' around all night.. I've been thinkin' about Allison and me.. an' you--
No, no. Forget it. I don't want it. Let's just get rid of it.
Ok uh, I guess I'll tell them that.
(angry, to himself) The ocean called. Running outta shrimp. Outta shrimp! (a thought occurs) Oh! Yes! That's what I shoulda said! (frustrated shout) Dammit!
What happens to charter tickets when you don't use em?
Never! It is a part of me. I will just return the chair, and it will be easy, because the receipt is in my good friend.
I have to get in touch with Tatiana! And look at his little outfit. It's all so coordinated, the way his socks matching to his shirt. I really hate this guy.
Who cares about eyebrows? Is she sweet? I like sweet. But not too sweet, you could throw up from that.
No, not a racial thing, there really is a resemblance...
Because filth is good. Whaddaya think, rock stars have sponges and ammonia lyin around the bathroom? They, have a woman comin over, Ive gotta tidy up? Yeah right, in these matters you never do what your instincts tell you. Always, ALWAYS do the opposite.
C-Communist? I am a Yankee, sir, first and foremost.
You mean a walk back in? That's the toughest move in the business. You're sending me out into no-mans-land, and if I get shot down I have to crawl all the way back. Well I can't do it! I can't do it, I tell ya!
Rid? Nah, c'mon, the word is 'care'. Care. I care about your comfort, be it here in Queens or twelve-hundred miles away.
I knew I had hit my high note so I thanked the crowd and I was gone.
You can't tell him the truth, you're gonna blow the whole thing.
This is not a Metallica concert, it?s an opera alright, a little dignity, a little class, just give me my ticket, I will stand over here and sell it.
Yes, two solariums. Quite a find. And I have horses, too?
Anyway, I was thinking about what you said. About uh, me and Marisa.
You think it's contact? It has to be touched?
Uhm...Id like to ask you...ask you to analyze a hypothetical phone call, you know, from a female point of view.
Ah, well, you know we gotta been running because of the ...
You know, like all the comedians always say, 'How would you like it if I came to where you work and heckled you?'
All right, I?ll tell you what, you seem like a nice guy, let?s stop jerking around. Give me.. two hundred and fifty dollars, I?ve got people waiting for me, I've got to get the hell out of here.
I'm very nervous about this. I've never spoken to a mental patient before.
Because of the day before. It's a long story.
Yeah, what is he? Some sort of an instigator?
It just didnt work out. What can I do? I wanted to love her. I tried to love her. I couldnt.
It's fine, we'll just meet him at the bubble boy's house.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. As long as youre going to lie to the guy, why dont you tell him that you lost both of the tickets, then we can go?
Im okay. Im fine. Im wonderful. I never felt better in my whole life.
Dad, he doesn't need to see the pole.
Yes, well you see, the deceased landed on my car. The uh splat, as it were, actually occurred on the roof of my car. Now of course I can't help but feel that had it been a convertible this whole tragedy might have been averted but I've never been the kind of guy to buy a convertible, what with the baldness and everything.
Mister Seinfeld? What about Mister Costanza? I'm not here?
How can you compare you parents to my parents?!
(crying from the onion) You'll see I'm right.
Das kaffes un salat e grand por favor.
Great. Jerry, I gotta tell you, I had the BEST TIME with that Nina last night. I - I think I'm in love with her already. You are a great friend. (Hugs Jerry) A great, great friend.
No, no, she might just think its a gift.
I don't know. I don't wanna be one of those guys.
Elaine, get something! Its all taken care of.
So he walks out of the stall, he's been talking the whole time.
Oh, I understand. (George exits; Sees Kramer in the hallway) Hey.
How's this for criticism? Um...you stink. How do like that criticism? You know what's funny to me? That diploma up on the wall. That is my idea of "com-med-dee"! You sitting here, telling people what to do.
She knows there is nothing to talk about.
There putting in a lost and found because of me. There's a time limit but still.
Alright, what are we getting? It's hot in here!
You didn't find it funny?! This is what I'm paying for?
Were having lunch with a friend. He works in the building.
I said 'God bless you'. Was that so wrong?
You paying my hotel and airfare to Miami?
All right, shmoopies...what's it gonna be? Pick a theater.
(passes cane from right to left and back a few times) But, see here. Right. Wrong. Right. Wrong. Right. Right. Wrong--
You know, I got this little swelling right here. (rolls up his sleeve to expose his wrist) It's kinda painful. What d'you make of it?
And then, then, then she leaves with somebody else! Never even, never even said goodbye! Never called me back.. Never apologized. Nothing. Like I was dirt.
I'm gonna read a book. From beginning to end. In that order.
He scratches off a 32 and he puts in 31.
(on a pay phone) Hey, hey, it's George, I need ya to do me a favor.
Peggy! (they all sit) His daughter Peggy. Peggy's coming over to serve.
You know, if it was a regular salad I wouldn't have said anything. But you had to have the BIG SALAD.
Come on 'Oh George, oh Geeeooorge!' Come on! Not that I don't appreciate the effort that was put into it.
What do you mean Wednesday? I though we had tickets to the Knick game Wednesday. We got seats behind the bench! What happened? Were not going?
Yeah, ha ha, It's not the toilets, it's not the toilets. It's something else. Are you ready for this?
Yeah. Hmm. Boy these really do pinch. I tell you, if I ever find the son of a bitch that stole my glasses...
Wait a minute Jerry, there's a bigger issue here. If you go through that wall and become one of those guys I'll be left here on this side. Take me with you.
Nose. (chuckles) What's the worst that can happen to a nose? What does it get? Stuffed? (chuckles)
(clears his throat) Im, uh, Im an architect.
Yes she is. It's a pity we won't be seeing much more of her.
...he embibed her glistening spell...just before the other shoe...fell.
It's exciting, isn't it? She's gonna have a whole new face.
Yes, she's pretty. What difference does it make?
(hangs up the phone) That's my toaster. I got to go. Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh!
(horrified) But that meeting starts in ten minutes!
Y'know, I'm better with the mothers than I am with the daughters.
(defensive) So what? So what if I do?
Oh, you might want to stick around Jerry. Mr. Thomassoulo picked the wrong man to hire because he was fake handicapped.
In every situation. No matter how silly I look. (Tastes his Clams Casino) Hm.. tastes a little funky.
Yeah, I may move out there. (getting 'yeah, right' glances from the Rosses) I mean it, I'll do it! OK, I'll see ya later. Keep it real!
Hey, Tim. Quick question. Is it normal for your teeth to make noises, like a hissing or a chirping?
(Frantically) Did anybody call here asking for Vandelay industries?
What about the Coast Guard? Seems like a lot of pride there, a lot of tradition.
The perfect combination of Mountain Dew and mozzarella...just the right amount of grease on the joy stick...
Wow, Keith Hernandez. He's such a great player.
Come on, hurry up, old man! I'm an animal!
But you didn't use a coaster, Jerry, you left a stain! (he runs to kitchen)
Aw, well, you know, it's your anniversary. It's - it's the least I can do. I - I just want you guys to go out and have a good time. Ha ha. So, you think we should, uh, we should get downstairs?
(shouts) Of course there's something wrong! (points at Jerry) We had a pact!
Youre doomed. Youre gonna have to have all your sex at womens apartments. Itll be like a permanent road trip. Forget about the home bed advantage.
Now I remember, as I jumped over the hole I heard a, like a jingling sound.
(Aggravated) Well, I got screwed on the donuts. There were none left. Heh!
And everything else has changed. But toilet paper is exactly the same, and will be so until we're dead.
Well, sure. They're Jewish, and you're a shiksa.
What's he yelling about? They're stealing jackets here!
So I still haven't heard about that job.
No problem there. Conformity is an obsession with me.
All right. I'm gonna try givin' them fifty-five dollars each... (to Elaine) What do you think?
But I mean look at him. He's gotta be on his feet like that all day? That's brutal. I think I'm gonna say something to your uncle.
(entering) Last night, huh? Was that something, or was that something?
Um, all right, um, uh, I'll call 'ya. I'll call you and we'll talk on the phone. A telephone communiqu. Every thing is fine ok, uh, fine, .. [exits]
Well, you know, It's interesting, you know, under that pressure, what you're capable of.
Ya gotta put on a show, ya always gotta give them a big show. You always have to be 'on' otherwise why would they like me? They'd just go for a better looking guy with more money.
Well, I'm gonna go back there later and return it when there's different people working.. You want to catch a movie?
It's not that I want to keep talking about it? just think that the subject should resolve itself based on its own momentum.
Ive spent the last hour preparing ten candy bars with no wrappers or identification of any kind for him to select from.
I don't know, but those are my socks! I had a pair just like that with the blue stripe, and now I don't have them anymore!
I mean, she's beautiful, right? She's just my type. The dark hair, the full lips.
Hey, hey, let's not get so defensive here. This is a give and take process.
(on phone, as Jerry gestures beside him) No, Lindsay, I had accidentally spilled coffee on the gentleman's windshield. Why would I do that? I have a job! Well, did she see a squeegee? Well, you're not going to make a dime without a squeegee. That's right, that's right, just tell your mother it was all a big misunderstanding. You won't regret it. Okay, I'll see you later. Buh-bye. (hangs up)
Reilly is no longer with the club. (getting up) You believe that?
Wa, I'm not getting out of this cab
Ha, I don't know who she's looking for. I don't know. I'll tell you something. She's very particular, your daughter. Very particular. What is she looking for some big hot shot businessman? Well I've got my pride too. I'm not going to beg her.
All right, let me just... I'm gonna grap an apple.
On-the-street cell-phone call is the lowest phone call you can make.
Nobody drives like me. Nobody. I'm doing things in this car, you have no idea they're going on. Wanna see me make a right turn from the left lane? Watch this.
Then, the last person to leave is Wilhelm. He sees my car, he figures I'm burning the midnight oil. Between the two of them, they think I'm working an 18 hour day! (he stands there with his hands on his hips, a wide grin - laughing.)
Jerry Seinfeld. My best friend. He can explain all of this. (calls to Jerry) Jerry.
Hey. You know, do I have a case for you guys to do on L.A. Law.
Hi, how are you guys? Listen, does either one of you have like a mint or piece of gum or...
Yeah, my wife couldnt make it today. Shes got something with her mother... Who knows whats going on with her. Dont let any one kid you, its tough.
Well if you and I ever got into, like a really serious fight you know, and the punches started flying -- who do you think would win?
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. It's from that grapefruit that Jerry squirted at me.
I still have it. The collar's okay. I wear it under sweaters.
I tought I picked up a little something. I'm very good at this. Did you pick up anything?
I just talked to Mr. Kruger, he'll be down in a minute. He wanted me to take a photograph for the record.
This MacKenzie, he's a bit of a nut. Someone told me he fired the last guy because his nose whistled when he breathed.
Why? What's wrong with the subject? This is a bad subject?
(proffering glasses) I hope prune juice is alright. It's the only thing I had that was chilled.
No, not really. I'm just saying this to you because I like to hear myself talk. Yes, really!
(Watching the mechanic leave) I know about the vein! I cant believe this guy..
Im starving. You got any of those free donuts you use to soften people up?
D'oh...Oh, oh, the judge! I hate this guy!
Well, I think we need more special days at the stadium, you know? Like, uh...Joe Pepitone Day. Or, uh...Jon Voight Day.
Well, it was very nice meeting you Shelly and Jerry be careful, there's a lot of nuts out there. (to Paula) All right you have everything?
(To Carl) Oh, by the way, order anything you want, it's all on me. Just do me a tiny favor pretend we're old friends. Oh my God! Mr. Morgan! What a coincidence, it's Mr. Morgan. Mr. Morgan, I want you to meet a dear old friend of mine, Carl.
Thats my candy line-up! Where are all my cards?! Theyre - theyre all on the floor!
I like, uh...(mutters something unintelligible under his breath.)
(Shrugging it off) She'll be fine. I gotta go to the hospital to see her tonight.
Huh... Cape... (turns, distracted, heads slowly towards door) What was a man with a cape doin' with my father?... What was my father doing with a man in a cape?... (opens door) Why a cape? Hmm! (exits)
Yeahaha, I gave it a shot (pats Jerry on the arm)... So, any word on the "artiste"? (puts a video in the VCR)
Hey, by the way, what'd you think of Miss Yoshimura?
No no, I never said I was a good driver, I said I was a good parker.
(irascible) Oh, I see. So your time is more valuable than mine. Is that it? You're a delicate genius!
Because if there's any doubt at all I...I feel we should cultivate it.
(to Carrie) You know, the thing is, I kinda promised the widow Mantle that I would name my baby Seven.
All right, just gimme that. And gimme some of those Sweet & Lows.
Jerry. Marla. (Realizing Jerry's cue) Stacey! (Walks over to Stacey)
Madam? What are you calling me madam for?
You can stuff your sorries in a sack, mister!
You know, you have to know how to do that. You cant have people shoving their arms into a six-hundred degree oven!
Who's going to bomb you. An airline for all the stupid little peanut jokes.
The man in the cape--I bet you he is mixed up in this! I don't trust men in capes.
How about the old Spider Man live action show?
It's impossible. I got him a wake up service.
All right, let's--let's focus. Can we get back to the plan?
(pointing outside) Why is there a Cadillac parked in front of the house?
Well, I - I could, Uh, I could give the money back. Here. (Holds it out)
Na....no ... This relationship he..he..has got to be about something and fast or I'm in very serious and weird trouble....hum What else happened?
Why do you have to be so suspicious of every one. This is a great man Zeng Zau, he wants to help bald people.
You know what? I should really go talk to her. Nothing confrontational. Just two adults sitting down trying to clear the air. You know, I just know if I could spend some time alone with her. I've got to. (he grabs his jacket) I've got to.
Exactly, you know what I'm talking about, right?
(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o. (Hes sitting on the floor in his Play Now office).
(worried) Yeah, that's right. What if it's a genetic thing, like father like son?
Well what about all the Lloyd Braun sales?
I bet they have more money than mine.
(walking back) Are you sure? 'Cause it could really help me out of a jam.
You've got to start seeing someone else. Get out of this relationship.
Where did this come from all of a sudden?
So, you want to come down to Mario's Pizza with me and help me pick up the Frogger?
Oh, Hey, hey, hey! That's great! That's very nice. You know we've been waiting twenty minutes for you people?! What do you think, you're Mussolini?!
Atlantic City? (thinks) Yes! Yes! I will go to Atlantic City. I'm in. I'm down.
Yeah, look at me. Now I GOTTA FIGURE OUT THE HAT SIZES OF 59,000 DIFFERENT PEOPLE!! WHAT IF A PINHEAD SHOWS UP. I GOTTA BE ON TOP OF THAT.
Hey, is it my imagination, or do really good looking women walk a lot faster than everybody else?
Hum..( to Elaine) Hey! did you talk to Paula?
(worked up) I can't have a cup of coffee with a person?! I'm not allowed to have coffee?!
Well, I can't walk anywhere now. I'm just gonna be wishing there were walkways. (seeing Elaine removing her shoe) What are you doing?
Celia broke out of prison. I'm sitting in my home, she shows up at the door!
Out of the question. Out of the question!
What's wrong? I'll tell you what's wrong. I just committed adultery!
What are you doing?...She had those nuts in her mouth, she just spit them out.
Well I am actually going to have a secretary and I get to do the interview.
What, you don't want me to hold your keys?
Cross the wires? I can't even make a pot of spaghetti.
I meet this women, Sheila. She works down at the one hour photo pace. She's got this incredible smile. Like she's got extra teeth or something
So is it all over between you and... Marsha Mason?
It's "ooh" As in "ooh ooh ah ah."
Whatcha got there, the 4-volt? Heh, I did you a favor.
And how does the baldness fit into that plan?
Interference! You cant count that! Come on, are you crazy?! The coin cannot touch anything, it affects it.
I didn't even know Fulton was in the hospital.
All right. I will see you boys later.
Wha-Is that the one your parents gave you?
What's he going to do? That's exactly the point. Nobody knows what this guy is capable of! He fires people like it is a bodily function.
Well, uhm, I think I'd like to do it.
These are not "scraps." These are historic remains of a once Great Society of Hair.
You think I should come clean? What d'you think, you think I Should confess?
Um, I don't uh, really think I can go.
Play Now thinks I got problems in both legs. My own personal Rascal, Jerry. On the house.
You never had sex in the office before?
Make-up sex? You have to have that right after the fight, we're way past that.
Ah ha, Ah ha. You would, wouldn't you?
Let Maria Shriver give her a baby shower.
The Duty Free Shop? Duty Free is the biggest sucker deal in retail. Do you know how much duty is?
Oh yeah, when are you gonna execute that plan?
Hey, did you see that whale thing on TV last night?
Hey, you know what else is playing here? ``Rochelle Rochelle''.
Look at this sparkle. (looks up, sees Lindsay's mother) Mrs. Enright! (runs after her) Mrs. Enright! Mrs. Enright!
The doc called and said the lab's backed up and now I'm not gonna get the results for another two days.
I know, I hate it too. I feel like an out of work porn star.
I can't believe this! What was wrong with it? What didn't you like about it?
(adamant) Yes I am. I defy you to come up with a better name than Seven.
No, I, uh, um, wa, wa, What did I do? ... Where are you going?
Do you think it might be possible to add a little shelf like, uh, for an alarm clock?
Hey, listen don't oversleep. You can't afford to be late again.
They're for protection, Jerry. Can you tell where I'm lookin'?
(Letting his conscious get the best of him) I wonder how Susan's father's going to react to this. Alright, what- what's the worst he could do? So you burn a cabin down..
Well, wha-what about the toe? What happened to the toe?
Well, I've given this a lot of thought, and I've gotta say...
(entering Jerry's bathroom) Well, Hanke's moved on to Step Ten. He was spotted taking personal inventory.
I can't. He's been on my case about not paying attention. Besides, it's too late, I already told him I heard him.
Do you think she gets to take any of those little bars of soap home?
Hey, where you just at the health club?
(to various people as he walks in) Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Hi nice to see you. How are you. Good morning. (to the secretary) Good morning.
I can't. I gotta make the weekly call to the folks.
We could be zipping all over the place.
Puddys just gonna give you the car, huh? (Skeptically) Youll see. First they stick you with the undercoating, rust-proofing, dealer prep. Suddenly, youre on your back like a turtle.
So she's just sitting there, she's having a pleasant conversation... and all of a sudden.
I want you to find out is she likes me.
I know I was just telling them the story.
Elaine? It's me, George. (Elaine opens the door.) Hey, sorry to bother you so late. (To Billy) Hey! How ya doin.' (To Elaine) Uh, did you get any of those sponges?
Well, actually you did miss one nugget of entertainment. (Pause) Have you ever seen Elaine dance?
Pamela?! Awright, I tell you what. You look like nice people, I'm gonna help you out. You want a beautiful name? Soda.
(Nervous, his voice cracks) Hey, Antonio. How's it going?
Well, I wanna put a picture of me and my boss Mr. Morgan up at the office.
Whatever. Believe me, if I wasn't involved right now, I wouldn't mind being set up. Something tells me she's a knockout. (we see, from the camera inside the cab, George's hand waving as the cab drives away)
You couldn't figure out the World's Theory for yourself? It's just common sense. Anybody knows, ya gotta keep your worlds apart. (gesturing with hands going outward)
He just read it. (Russell vomits again. Jerry and George look ashamed.)
(to Jerry, as Jerry nods in agreement) You know I think she might have something there.
Then I got off the phone right away.
Mister Fowler, I-I have a squirrel here that is a miracle of modern science! (laughs)
Wait, wait a minute...they don't have them anymore. I just found out, they just took them off the market.
Pretty chintzy, huh? Considering the money she makes.. She's a big executive for Federal Express.
rush? you want a rush? drop a ball on your toe my friend, talk about a rush, you'll be throbbing, you'll see visions
Yes. Me, too. I wanna be normal. Normal.
(Threatening) Hold it! One more step and were walkin!
But I have to have them by one o'clock. He's very regiment about his meals.
Why is what I do is so important? Why must I be always the focal point of attention? Let me just be, let me live.
Alright, let's see, let's see. What else. What else. Oh yeah, what does she do?
What were you saying to the Rosses over there, anyway?
I offered to pay. She should've said no.
I can't be blind, Jerry The blind are courageous.
He said that? (Daphne shacks her head) What a nerve. How dare he say something like that.
Kramer, what's the name of the store with the mannequin?
Excuse me, are you going to be much longer? I have to make a very important call.
Who do I like? I, like, uh, Art, Vandelay.
uh Tony? there's not gonna be too many sandwiches
All right, enough! Enough! From now on, no more yada yada's. Just give me the full story.
The network executive. You think she liked me?
It's a very complicated move! I couldn't remember it all.
I just pray Kruger doesn't realize that it's gone until this guy can fix it up.
My heart! My heart! (To Assistant) Where you going? Are you crazy?!
(Pointing to them) Office Christmas gift. I tell you, this Human Fund is a gold mine!
Hey Elaine? Put me down for some of that art. 1,900 dollars worth.
See, Steinbrenner is like the first guy in, at the crack of dawn. He sees my car, he figures I'm the first guy in
I didn't know you were such a Bette Midler fan.
I guess I've been hanging on to them for so long cuz i couldn't accept the fact that Dad was really gone forever (hugs a piece of clothing)
Sorry. I'll just go back to my usual routine.
Oh yeah.. (Starts to open it) Sally called Susan - said you guys really hit it off.
Oh, sure. Of course. (looks for place to set down flowers) Um, uh, could you hold these? For just a second, just a second. (grabs newspapers from trash bin, begins wiping windshield) Here you go, now don't worry about a thing. It's gonna be fine. Here we go. Look at this shine.
What do you mean you didn't think I wasn't gonna use them?!
(using the phone) Watch how it's done. Oh, hello, Mr. Vandelay? Would you like to buy a computer? Oh, really? Two dozen?
(still in Jacks voice) I'm working on my Jack Nicholson, You can't handle the truth! (he salutes)
People can drop change down here, Jerry. And theyre too lazy to pick it up.
Exactly! Because neither one of us can't handle a woman all by ourselves.
(excited) So then, as we were leaving, we were just kind of standing there, and she was sort of smiling at me, and I wasnt sure if she wanted me to ask her out, because when women smile at me I dont know what it means. Sometimes I interpret it like theyre psychotic or something and I dont know if Im supposed to smile back, I dont know what to do. So I just stood there like  remember how Quayle looked when Benson gave him that Kennedy line? Thats what I looked like.
You ditched me. That's twice. Now I demand to know what's going on!
Well, you know, I gotta go to, uh, Susan's parent's house for dinner.. and, you know, I want to shower first.. and I want to leave myself plenty of time.
Well...I was in the locker room showering, and I...I had to go, so...
Should I give you my keys, is that the transaction, trading keys...? Because Elaine has my keys.
Sweet guy (Receives the phone from Beth, Starts to talk to Jerry) Hello
(delighted) Jerry? It was incredible! Models! As far as the eye could see!
Oh, this is unbelievable. I'm stuck. Every time I think I'm out, they pull me back in.
She wants me to take an IQ test.
She had an itch. She could have used any one of those fingers. That finger was meant for me.
Please give it to me. I love to help people. This is what I do. Come on. I'm going this way. (he takes the table from Jodi's hands and she has no choice but to follow him)
How come this sweater is only 85 dollars?
Well, I was 14 years old. I was in my friends bathroom. His mother's brassieres were hanging on the shower rod and I picked it up, studied it. I thought, I like this. I didn't know what way or what level, but I knew I wanted to be around brassieres.
You don't understand. A garage. I can't even pull in there. It's like going to a prostitute. Why should I pay, when if I apply myself, maybe I could get it for free? (he hears a horn honking) What? What do you want? Go around me, I'm looking for spaces.
Pssh. Would the protg pick up stuff for the mentor?
You are a genius, it's as simple as that.
Okay, look, Audrey, before you take the bandage off just remember that I was the one that encouraged you to do this, you know? Now that you're gonna be a great beauty, let's not forget how this all began. You know, like if you'd listened to your friend, Elaine,
Well, how good a look did you get?
You, uh, wanted to see me, Mr. Steinbrenner?
So who am I to be thinking about someone's nose? I mean, I should be grateful someone like her even looks at me. I have no job, nothing. But I have to say, I think about the nose. I don't want to think about the nose. I don't ask to think about the nose, but I think about it. I go to bed at night, I tell myself, 'Don't think about the nose, forget the nose,' but I think about it. I look at her, I see nose.
"BECAUSE IF HE CAN'T JUMP. THERE GOES MY SNEAKER BUSINESS!!"
I still won't be able to forgive myself - but at least it won't be about this.
That's David Letterman. I just saw David Letterman walk by. I'll be right back. (He exits)
How's her handshake? A little firm, isn't it? Maybe a little too firm?
Alright, I gotta go home and open up with the house for the carpet cleaners. You know they're doing my whole place for twenty-five dollars.
I love it. New office, new salary. I'm the new Wilhelm.
Yeah. Thanks. Hey, listen, if you ever get a date, maybe the four of us could go out together sometime.
I dont know how you put up with this.
What do we have in the fruit department?
Yes. Yes. You know what's interesting. The quarterback for the Atlanta Falcons is Bobby Hebert. No "r" which I find fascinating. You know it's Herbert h-e-r-b-e-r-t, Hebert h-e-b-e-r-t. "Hebert" it's a fun name to pronounce. Try and say it Hebert. Take a shot. All right. (check arrives) All right. I
No, its not a problem, I can get rid of the apartment this afternoon.
So, what? We're gonna do nothing now, this is crazy.
Oh, gotta get fifty. Gotta get fifty. All right, I tell you what. We go to the coffee shop, you call your manager. Maybe they made an offer.
Can I say one thing to you? And I say this with an unblemished record of staunch heterosexuality.
Yeah, but get this, the message said 'call me if you have the time'. Heh heh if I have the time, you get it?
No, no, no, no, Im It. I win.
You want to hear more? The master bedroom opens into the solarium.
I guess that leaves me in the clear...
This is it! It happened to me, Jerry! I was sitting in the restaurant, the two nut jobs were talking - I couldn't take it any more. I got up, and (Makes a noise) I bop into this woman..
Yeah, You remember the, the little eh, bank book, there?
Hi Beth (Scene Ends then re-begins with Beth and George on Beth's couch) Um anyway Jerry told me that uh.. it might have been my comment in the Coffee Shop that broke you up.
That's a very good question. You know she and I go out for dinner, she doesn't even reach for the check. That?s all I?m asking for is a reach. Is that so much to ask for?
This good be so sweet, Jerry. Saving lives? She's one step away working at the clinique counter!
Thats exquisite. Listen, uh, if its not too much trouble, could you pass me that paper over there?
She, uh, went shopping for some shoes for the wedding and, yada yada yada, I'll see her in six to eight months. (Kramer and Julie enter)
Because of me? You must be joking! Who wouldn't want to live because of me? I'm nothing!
He's actually doing him a favor. It's less money for him to buy food.
Well I think it would be nice if there was some kind of historical record of it.
Yeah, well you have to maintain the same disposition too. You can't start acting any differently. You have to be nice.
Oh yes I am Father. Incredibly sincere. So, uh, pffft, am I in?
So you - you really don't have my hat?
How are you closer to him than me?
The parakeet in the mirror. That's a good one, Stu.
Oh, uh, "The Falconer" by John Cheever. It's really excellent.
That's dynamite. Yeah, I'll look for the Chinese food leftovers.
I can't believe you're hoarding sex moves. I'm out there rubbing two sticks together. You walk around with a zippo.
He's older, completely covered in filth, no whistle, but I think it's him.
Yeah, you gotta do it classy (wipes his mouth to his sweater.)
(handing over a bill) Can I get a pack of gum, please?
It's really not accurate. Nobody drinks from a water cooler any more - they use bottles.
(Angry) Yeah, that's what they told me the last time.
So what's the deal they don't want to have dinner with my parents?
(Looking at his finger) I think somethin bit me. I just need another nickel.
Oh, no, thanks. I cant drink coffee late at night, it keeps me up.
(Slowly backing away, he's not at all committed to the conversation) Yeah.. television.
Assistant to the travelling secretary. (fishing for a reaction) I'm uh, working on the project.
I thought he was just gonna have a muffin.
I have tell you, I'm pretty impressed with the first one.
Phil, I loved those cigars! Incoming! (Flicks his card tward Phil)
Okay. Uh, my mother is is going to pay for the sessions. ... Oh,Elaine?
You see (to Jerry). You see. You see what Im talking about. It's all just slipping away. And you're letting it happen. (exits -- slamming the door)
(Annoyed) Yeah, yeah. We'll, uh, let you know.
Please. They dont do anything. Look, do I have to break up with her in person? Cant I do it over the phone? I-I have no stomach for these things.
So this Anna called me from out of the blue.
Twelve dollars? I knew we should have gone to the bakery. I guarantee you theyre not getting no twelve dollar cake.
(offers his) Oh, you want to taste mine.
Why don't you call her agency. Maybe she's been out of town and she didn't get the calls.
Jerry, can I talk to you for a second? (They enter Jerry's apartment)
There's an easy move go from screwin' you behind your back to screwin' you right to your face.
(excited) Great news! I showed the pilot to Kramer's Japanese friends. They loved it!
Now, listen closely. I was at the unemployment office and I told them that I was very close to getting a job with Vandelay Industries and I gave them your phone number. So, when now when the phone rings you've got to answer "Vandelay Industries".
No no. That's not what I was trying to do.
I suppose if I had suggested Liam Neeson Day, you'd all be patting me on the back.
Oh, there's better, (pointing at the row in front of them) right there, that's better.
I got up, I was supposed to go to work, I came here instead.
Boy that-that bank clock is-is eight minutes off.
I havent seen it yet, but its a two-bedroom, its on the uh, west 83rd, bout a half block from the park?
It was an inferno in there! An inferno! (Eric, Robin's mother, and all the kids rush at George.)
My tonsils? Yeah, when I was a kid.
I need some water. I gotta get some water.
He's right! It's the same thing with the femenists. You know, they want everything to be equal, everything! But when the check comes, where are they?
I thought the thing you said about the sex not being simulated . That was really funny.
What are we supposed to do? What do you do on a situation like this? Should we call a lawyer, should we call the police?
I dont understand, you never talk to her about other women?
(standing up) I'm just gonna go to the bathroom.
Yes, they are bold. Jerry, what do you think?
I don't think so I know so, Kramer, come here I got to talk to you
(looking at the door) He's starin' at us.
Hello, it's Natalie? Yeah, this is a business office but I'm not a business man per se. I'm here working for the people. Yes, I'm causing dissent. Stirring the pot. Getting people to question the whole rotten system.
Do you uh feel the way you feel after the Risotto?
Actually, I never had any formal training. I guess I'd be better suited for improvs, or something..
What happened to Babs. She never showed up last night. The whole thing blew up in my face.
Eh, there's that woman that never talks to anybody.
Well, anything I can do to help, um...she's a wonderful girl. Very smart. Very eh...crafty.
I must have dripped some on the floor and I slipped and...
(holding a magazine cover) Mira Sorvino. Think she'd go out with me?
Are, are you sure this is decaf? Wheres the orange indicator?
I wasn't going to say anything, but then I could see that he wasn't going to open his mouth. (Chuckles)
Well then she's just a Liar, Isn't she?
I know, I know and you know *why* they're moving there?
Oh, yes I am. Mr. Thomassoulo likes to play dirty. Well, theres nothing dirtier than a giant ball of oil.
All right, uh, okay, I got it, um, Ill sing.
If you're in some situation where some fast cash will save your life, I'll give you the code.
Handicap? (gesturing to his cane) Oh, I'm not handicapped.
Oh, I'll pay. Half-price. Arrivederci my fellow 40-short.
I am not buying something just to get change.
Aw, come on. I wanna go see him.
(quieter desperation) They took my belt, Jerry. I got nothing to hold my pants up. (listens) Well, you gotta come over here now! Just tell 'em what we talked about, how I, how I, I didn't do the project.
You are not gonna believe whats going on with this woman.
I think I'd be good at that. I talk to people all the time. Someone even told me once they thought I'd be a good talk show host.
What are you talking about.. I WANT MY CAR!!
No, I don't know who was doing that.
I don't know what Newman wanted to see me for.
Every night at six-thirty. The nurse was gorgeous.. then I got a look at the patient.. (Laughs, then snorts) I was going nuts.
Yeah, well, I guess the only thing I can do is go into George Steinbrenners office and tell him he has to give her a raise.
I did. I'm back. I love this relationship, I feel so liberated!
He might as well have! I caught him, and his face was covered in chocolate and cookie crumbs.
I mean , when I said Hello did she say Hello back?
Right. (Mumbles) Nastercoff.. What country is he from, again?
Oh my God, an affair. That's so adult. It's like with stockings and martinis, and William Holden. On the other hand it probably wouldn't cost me any money.
(Hangs up phone and pauses) this is great! He fired her! This is incredible, he fired her. I'm out, baby! I'm out!
No difference. I could care less. She's Jerry's girlfriend.
Hey, check this out. I gotta give out Christmas presents to everyone down at Kruger, so I'm pulling a Whatley. (Give a Christmas card to Jerry)
Why don't you think before you do something?
Well all right, beautiful, so you stop in. Ya, ya visit the bubble boy for twenty minutes and then we can go.
I'm trying to buy some of the clothes back. (realizing something) Hey you wanna come over for dinner tonight? My mother made all this extra Paella.
Y'know... I could hear you on the other line...
I had a feeling you would like it. No, don't try it on now, try it on later.
It's a huge problem, Jerry. The hardest part about having sex with a woman is getting her to come back to your place! He's already got that.
(Wanting Elaine to take it off his hands, he tries to silence Jerry) Jerry, simmer down.
Hu, oh. No he thought I was hiding something from him about Morgan.
Elaine and her sponges...she's got like, a war chest full of them.
(Gets up, stopping him) Woah, woah, woah! What are you telling me for? You really had me going, there! C'mon, sit down. (They both sit back down) What do you want to do when you grow up?
So she starts vaccuming, back and forth, back and forth, her hips swivelling, her breasts, uh... (trying to think of a word)
Lemme see. I can't believe you got these for free. (Looking at the tickets) Row F?!
Yea, ya..ya know I feel terrible about Joey but it's jus..it's a great business opportunity. I-I don't even know how long I'm gonna be away for.
But she's gonna know that I like her more than she likes me.
You know, I could have actually gone to that.
How you gonna catch him? He's probably boarded the plane already.
A backup system? We're designing bathroom doors with our legs exposed in anticipation of the locks not working? That's not a system. That's a complete breakdown of the system.
Listen I was talking to Elaine today and she said she'd would really like to be an usher at the wedding
Oh, she's a Kramer. And uh, while I was there I uh happened to pick up another juicy little nugget about our friend.
Id like to have a kid. Of course, you have to have a date first... Remember my friend, Adam, from Detroit?
Well, I was exaggerating a bit, just for effect.
All I know is I've been going to doctors all my life. What has it gotten me? I'm thirty-three years old. I haven't outgrown the problems of puberty, I'm already facing the problems of old age. I completely skipped healthy adulthood. I went from having orgasms immediately to taking forever. You could do your taxes in the time it takes me to have an orgasm. I've never had a normal, medium orgasm.
What? I'm not married. I'm not allowed to go out with somebody else?
I dont know where the nurse is. Sweetheart why dont you get a nurse for mommy?  Anyway I was just curious. Remember the other day you were saying something about my trip.
Let me ask you a question. This new move. Is there a knuckle involved in any way?
Oh!, so what. I'd rather she hate me and thought I was good looking....At least I can get somebody else. (scratching his chest) What is this? Why am I itching?
Sometimes at restaurants she talks to her food 'Ooh, Mr. Mashed Potatoes, you are sooo goood.'
Oh I'm seeing someone, yes. You know her, Daphne Bower.
Ow! .. Ow! I give, I give! Uncle!
You're considering hiring me for your latex salesman.
This friend of Susan's is staying with us for two weeks...Now am I wrong or is that excessive?
Oh yeah the nipple. But besides that. How did you feel about Kramer's work?
Lupe. That's very nice, very nice. Listen, are you going to be making up the bed in the morning?
Hey pop, would you buzz off, I've got something cooking.
Right. And, and to cover my nervousness I started eating an apple, because I think if they hear you chewing on the other end of the phone, it makes you sound casual.
I think he should wear whatever tie he wants.
I want to know how did that get into my car?
Anyway, I don't even get a thank you. I don't get it!
Listen, Buck, I uh...obviously I don't need to talk to you about the importance of player morale, but uh...I've been talking to some of the guys, and some of them - I don't want to mention any names - but some of them...they're not too happy with the polyester uniforms.
(Sliding over to make room for her) Sit down. Join us, please.
It's not really a mental institution. It's more like a depression clinic. She went out to Woodhaven and checked herself in. I'm, I'm sick over this.
Had to come in and maybe well get together? Had to and maybe?
Uh, let me ask you something. You uh, you ever hear of Marisa Tomei?
Do you have something a little more... less expensive?
Ah, ...A beautiful successful intelligent woman's in love with me and I throw it all away. uh oh boy. Now I'll spend the rest of my life living alone. I'll sit in my disgusting little apartment watching basketball games, eating Chinese take out. Walking around with no underwear. Because I'm too lazy to do a laundry.
Do you know what happens if I miss him? I don't get credit for the pickup and I lose my 50 bucks...
She doesn't deserve a baby shower. She deserves a baby monsoon. She deserves Rosemary's baby!
You can't do that, you can't just sneak in from the back like that.
Oh now you're gonna go? ELAINE I'll be back in five minutes.
I dont know, what? Eight thousand. Its a Hyundai. Get out of here. I told you not to sell. Simons made money, Wilkinson cleaned up.
(resentfully dampened) It's not a prom. It's a Ball.
Your friend is been accused of being a serial killer. I think that qualifies.
What am I supposed to get, a bazooka?
I gave her a twenty, she only gave me change for a ten.
You're my mother! What wouldn't I do for you?
I'm gonna go with you. I gotta get a new suit. I got a second interview with MacKenzie, and I think I'm really close. They're all taking me out to lunch on Friday.
I'm family. I'm having sex with the cousin!
Of course. So, Im looking at it. I look up, I see shes looking at it. Our eyes lock. It was a horrible moment. I just..
Uh, let me ask you a question. Could you, uh, expand the space underneath a desk to give it a little more headroom?
So, whaddya say? You know you'll always be the only man I'll ever love.
You just checked your watch. Are you thinking of bailing on him?
Well, aren't you the boss of him? You shouldn't let him move up! When I was in the Cub Scouts, I got stuck on Weebolos for three years 'cause I kept losing the Pinewood Derby.
I won't be able to, concentrate in front of you.
Beautiful women. You know they could get away with murder. You never she any of them lift anything over three pounds. They get whatever they want whenever they want it. You can't stop them.
(animated) Fixed up? A cup of coffee! A cup of coffee is not a fix up!
(enthusiastic) And, you know, I do a lotta business with Japanese TV. They broadcast a lot of American baseball. They got an office here in New York!
Yeah. You could base a character on me.
Yes, but I still don't feel right about letting you into Kramer's apartment without his permission.
Hey, Mr Seinfeld. (shakes Morty's hand) Hey, Mrs Seinfeld. How are you?
How do I know, maybe, you know, maybe she wanted to be polite.
I'm sorry about that lock on the liquor cabinet. The combination musta just flown outta my head. It's a mental block.
(on tape, lifeless) Hey, it's George. I got nothin' to say... (beep)
They're not here! You cost me fifty bucks!
Oh my God...You're in jail? (Celia nods.) That is so cool!
No. So, tonight she's got tickets for that show she's been working on. The Flying Sandos Brother.
I- I'm pretty sure I left it eh, behind the cushion of the chair ... accidentally.
I'm cold too. At least you've got a coat. Let's get in the car.
Ill tell you, if I was running for office I would ask for the death penalty for double-parkers. If this is allowed to go on this is not a society. THIS IS ANARCHY!
Bear with you! This is a parking lot PEOPLE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO GET
Well, it's a good looking piece of meat. (laughs nervously) Wow, this is some place. A duplex, huh? (indicating) Look at this, you got stairs in an apartment. All my life, I dreamed about having steps in an apartment. Even one step. Sunken living room. Although, one step is really not all that sunken. (tries hard to elicit a laugh)
Nah, with crutches it's a funny story, with a cane it's a sad story. You through with those?
Ovaltine. Have you ever had this stuff? Why is it called Ovaltine?
Would you get out of here. Who's gonna turn down a chair? I would be very interested to know how he felt about all of this. Maybe I'll have a talk with him.
(Defensively loud) It was when I was banging!
Uh, yeah, I'll be there in a minute.
Oh, no. No. No. No. No. Nothing. I'm fine. Everything's fine. Fine. Just get a little nervous on the weekends, that's all. Could I, uh, could I get a glass of water?
Yeah. Thanks for, thanks for coming by fellas. Eh, got a set of keys, buried in the pothole.
Don't you see what it says here? Don't you understand what that's implying?
You hear the way he talks to me?
I can't believe it. Look, that's Jerry Seinfeld.
So, I am have to going to break up with you.
Yeah? Well, I had sex with your wife.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. You can't say anything. (rushes to take phone from Jerry)
So what do you care what she thinks.
Yes, it is consistent. I've, uh, I've tried to maintain a consistent feel throughout the house.
Wait a second. I think I see where that laser guy is. No! Don't look! Don't look. Oh, yeah, that's him. Ok. I'm gonna sneak up on him. Now the hunted becomes the hunter.
So, she's the loser of the group. Every group has someone that they all make fun of.. Like us with Elaine. (Jerry thinks about this, then shakes it off)
[studying his jacket] Oh man! Look at this! I sat in gum. Oh, by the way, you owe me seven fifty.
I cant call her now. Its too soon. Im planning a Wednesday call.
So it was my comment that broke them up?
Look I need you to do me a favor. I need you to get me lunch at Pisano's.
Listen to the comeback. (pleased) 'Oh yeah? Well the jerk store called. They're running outta you.'
You think she thinks I have a beautiful face, or is she just saying that?
You know, sometimes those guys don't make it back. (Looks in fridge) I'm really hungry.
I cant stand doing laundry. Thats why I have forty pairs of underwear.
Well it's tough to get a good read but I think if I brought him a chair, he'd sit.
I know. I just sort of leaned on it so it would look like it was mine.
Here. Let me take your tabe downstairs for you.
Toasting makes me uncomfortable. But toast, I love. Never start the day without a good piece of toast. In fact, let's toast to toast.
Hey. Check these out. I just picked them up from Sheila. She must have loved these.
Yeah, "duty". Do you know how much duty is?
Dad, that other car cut us off! They had swastikas all over it... They were hurling racial epiphates at us... I could have been killed!
Because, Jerry, it's a couple rule! We have to tell each other everything!
Behind the dugout, are you kidding? How did you get them?
Well nothing. I didn't actually say that. (Karen is still laughing)
What kind of a shake does he have?
...It was all a terrible misunderstanding, sir. Just five minutes. Just five minutes of your time. (listens) Thank you! Thank you, Mister Dalrimple.
(adamant) It's smart. It's a smart line, and a smart crowd will appreciate it. (shouting) And, I'm not gonna dumb it down for some bonehead mass audience!
(to Claire) Now, a woman calls me, all right?
Now Peterman wants me to go to the funeral.
Don't you see how wrong that is?! Where's your Christmas spirit? And eye for an eye!
Well, it worked when I met George Peppard last week.
Frolf, frisbee golf Jerry. Golf with a frisbee. This is gonna be my time. Time to taste the fruits and let the juices drip down my chin. I proclaim this The Summer of George!
(Complaining) I can't read it. I need my glasses!
Carol, thats so rude. Please, Im serious, just for a moment, if you wouldnt mind. And then well talk to Jerry.
Right. So I call her up, I tell her its me, she gives me an enthusiastic Hi!
How can I do this? How can I move back in with those people? Please, tell me. They're insane. You know that.
. . . naw, it's just you thanked HER, and and oh, . . . what's the difference?
(pleased with himself) You are having problems with your boyfriend and I am meeting you to discuss the situation.
That reminds me, I'm not getting you guys any more fruit. That guy was eyeballing me the whole time. He gave me the creeps. All right, you owe me twenty-eight sixty.
Take it off. You're going to ruin it.
Ooooo, I'm scared. . . . Ohoooo they're not going to do the show.
No! My ticket?! You gave my ticket to Horneck?
Faking? What makes you think that I have time to see doctors, take X-rays, make appointments, when there's absolutely nothing wrong with me? What kind of a person would do a thing like that?
Oh my God. I just remembered where I left my retainer in second grade. I'll see ya. (He throws finished Rubik's cube to Jerry and he exits. Kramer enters)
Well, it doesn't even have to be the general manager. Maybe I could be like, an announcer. Like a color man. You know how I always make those interesting comments during the game.
Would you like a Pepto-Bismol? I keep them in my wallet...! (Russell goes into the bathroom and shuts the door.) (To Jerry) Do you think he liked it? (From the bathroom, we hear Russell violently heaving his guts.)
All right. Kramer, you block off traffic. You to go sweet-talk the pharmacist.
All right. So, he caught me in a cleavage peek, so big deal. Who wouldn't look at his daughter's cleavage? She's got nice cleavage.
I love it! This is fantastic! Look at this couch, is this velvet?!
Yeah. Eric the Clown put it out with his big shoe.
If you dont say anything I will assume its a plane crash.
I went to look in the mirror, it wasn't there. You threw off my equilibrium.
What kind of a sick impulse does that??
Yeah, he's in my bed. I'm sleeping on the couch.
Okay, how about this? All right, we get married March 21st, the first day of Spring.
Students cant clean. Its anathema. (explaining) They dont like it.
There was a box of raisins on the coffee table. Did you, by any chance, take them with you when left?
'Maybe you know some little places to go, where they never close...'
Yeah, you know we spoke for a little bit...
(Smiling) You got it, Ma. (She smiles back, nodding) A little later. (George sits back in a nearby chair, looking at the divider in anticipation)
Because I'm a cheater! I had to tell you.
Now Im in the worst position of all.
Yes, I like to just be able to take the blankets and swish them and swirl them, you know what I mean? You know, I don't like being all tucked in. I like to have a lot of room, you know I like to have my toes pointed up in the air. Just like to scrunch up the blankets.
So I saw that new movie about the Hindenburg.
Hey, I am not a prude sweetheart. I swing with the best of them. (snapping his fingers 5 times)
(Once again, still on the shower) Could it be lukewarm?
Wha..? I didn't tell you? I gotta go meet Elaine.
I think hitting a defenseless child is my business.
Yeah. Hey, wait a second, you know, good news for you too. Susan's best friend, Hallie? Broke up with her boyfriend.
I know less about women than anyone in the world. But one thing I do know is they're not happy if you don't spend the night. It could be a hot, sweaty room with no air conditioning and all they have is a little army cot this wide (Displays with French fry) You're not going anywhere.
Well, at least, I'm not carrying a purse.
Mon...? No, no, I can't wait til Monday, that's impossible, I gotta talk to him now. Where does he live?
Nothing, why? You think something's wrong? Am I different?
Me too. I've been yelling at strangers on the street.
It's cleavage. I couldn't look away. What am I, waiting to win an Oscar here? This is all I have in my life.
Know what? Ponce De Leon is sold out.
So, how do you like the way I talked you into comin' down here?
I mean, now she thinks that I'm one of these guys that love her. Nobody wants to be with somebody that loves them.
So Anyway, I started to compliment Elaine on her sketches and it turns out,they're Paula's.
Me? It wasn't me I never even saw the ball. All you do is dribble.
I guess I should be, but Im not.
(George, finger in the peanut butter jar) This is what I do.
(Very loud in the direction of a waiter) I'm gonna need a coffee here. Very hot! Boiling!
Doing quite well, thank you. Yesterday I had a soft boiled egg and a quickie. You know what? If I could add TV to the equation, that would really be the ultimate.
(ecstatic) What? You're moving to Florida!?! That's wonderful! I'm so happy! (pause) For you! I'm so happy for you! Oh, what do you need this cold weather for?
Yep. Classic horseshoe pattern. I've seen a lot of this.
(desperate) Steinbrenner had me committed! I'm in the nuthouse!
Why can't I have a heart attack? I'm allowed.
The way they make 'em these days, I'll never have to tell her.
Who goes to the Super Bowl with their mailman?!
(on phone  calling secretary) Hello Margery, George Costanza. How are you sweet heart? Listen, can you give Mr. Thomassoulo a message for me? Yes. If he needs me, tell him (screams) IM IN MY OFFICE! Thanks.
Did you dressed nice, did you do it classy?
How are they gonna make that book into a movie?
Yes, yes, you know I was in detention and she came up behind me while I was erasing the blackboard . . .
Yeah.. (Trying to remember) Poverotti.. Domingo.. and.. uh.. the other guy.
With the orange hair, and the big clown shirt with the ruffles...
All right. So, what theatre you wanna go to tonight? We got 61st and 3rd or 84th and Broadway.
Oh, thanks, Bobby. (To Celia) Well, I guess I'll see you in four days.
That condom killed me. Why do they have to make the wrappers on those things so hard to open?
(Puts his hands on his face, rubbing his eyes) Look. It's a skill, just like juggling. She probably enjoys showing it off.
What about me? I was a total failure. Everything was fine. Now this thing's gonna be a success and God's gonna give me a terminal disease.
Why even try anymore? There's no sense to it. I'm never gonna meet anybody, I should just accept it.
Wait a minute, Rinitze? Don't they have somme really cool suits in there?
So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified! But I pressed on -- and as I made my way passed the breakers a strange calm came over me. I-I don't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment  I was a Marine Biologist!
All right, listen, I'll see you guys later.
I don't know, I have to call her, tell her where we are. I'm very lucky she's even considering seeing me at all.
No no no, no mistake, no mistake. No, no , listen, we're going to get married over Christmas, I It doesn't make any difference to me. It's fine. Really.
No, that's a fair question. It is, uhm... (nervous chuckle) Jerry, yeah. (to Cynthia) Jerry's a friend of mine. (to Russell) He uh, he gave it to me. Unbelievable how many addresses of people this guy has.
She supports her whole family. (walking slowly into the room)
Well, anyway, the book club meets tomorrow, Mr. Temple.
Jerry, it's me, George, don't worry, I'll return it tomorrow, no problem.
Maybe she wasn't! Maybe she heard the whole conversation!
So what, he's got a couple of good jokes.
I tell ya, I hear people really stuff themselves on those cruise ships. (Laughs) The buffet, that's the real ordeal, huh, Clarence? (Laughs)
What, you didn't ask him about the car?
Are you crazy? This is like discovering Plutonium ... by accident.
Yes, the surprise blindfold greeting. That wasnt in the manual, I dont know.
Yes they did. I was covering. Elaine has been deported back to Scotland.
(CONT'D) Excuse me...I really... What's happened is that my friend forgot where he parked and if you're not in a big hurry, we'd really appreciate it if...
Get out!! (Jerry gets out and George drives away. A couple of guys notice Jerry in his cowboy boots.)
Yeah, drove away.. You know, I said 'Hello' to him. You know, he's - he's-
What red dot? What are you talking about? Jerry come here for a second. Do you see anything here?
What do you mean you will? That's a bad idea. Jerry is a very private person.
Just the last few innings of a double-header.
Why don't you give me the twenty, and I'll stop and get change, and then you and I can... uh... you-know, settle.
I'm the bad boy. I've never been the bad boy.
Jerry ... Where are you? I know you like to sit back here. Elaine! Susan!
Really? I thought you and Celia were sleeping together?
You know, we could go uptown, and that way we could give Jerry a ride home.
I really think I should have been consulted about this.
It's a performance, Jerry. Like what you do.
Yeah. Yes! I just haven't seen you in a long time.
(opening door to leave) He picked her up?
Are you crazy? You take your life in your hands with those nuts.
Fragile Frankie Merman? I never liked that guy.
All right, we'll be a little late, I,m not taking a cab.
Does Neil like to eat a big breakfast?
No, no, no, I dont want to carry it around all night. Ill pick it up later.
I told her. In the kitchen  which was risky cause its near all the knives. I started with the word Listen.
All right. See you tomorrow. (George sighs, exits.)
(feigning excitement) Great, great. O-Oh, oh, oh, gosh. You know, it's just... my duties with the Yankees...
Um, you know Im starting to think that maybe lobster isnt the way to go.
You think the person you were talking to is him? That's not even close to him. He's funny, Jerry's funny.
Parker, I never said driver, I said parker, a great parker.
Well, you know, book reports. That kind of stuff.
Why didn't you just wear a heavier coat?
So, Im thinking, as shes saying this, Im thinking great, the relationships over. But the egg salads on the way. So now I have a decision Do I walk or do I eat?
Well you missed a lovely little party that we had for Grace.
So I tell Alec that I have to go to Paris for an undetermined amount of time. Then all I have to do is buy some post cards and have your parents mail them from Paris.
Well, does he wear bland, drab, olive colored clothing?
Well I guess that's because I wear boxer shorts.
THIS is your daughter? My God! My God! I I hope you don't mind my saying. She is breathtaking.
Hold on. Hold on. Wait a minute. How am I gonna get the rye bread into the apartment?
Would you wait a second? Just wait? (They fight over it.)
You have no idea how refreshing that is.
(harassed) Are you aware that I'm being charged for Tuesday's appointment? I had to take my mother to the chiropodist.
(After looking in the bag) The pea pods? All you saved was the pea pods? (Kramer enters)
They will get a good home won't they?
Yeah. I am like a drug dealer. I got the guy hooked. I am having lunch at his desk everyday this week. He doesn't make a move without me. It's very exciting.
They're men with jobs, Jerry! They wear suits and ties. They're married, they have secretaries.
I'm all for awkward pauses. Fix me up with her.. Wait a minute, Nina just saw me in my Timberlands! Now I have to wear them every time I see her.
Nah, I guess I should really get moving on this, huh? I'm gonna go. (Opens the door, letting Newman in. Leaves)
(smug) Ah, I guess I showed Neil who's Neil.
Yeah, well when you don't actually do the steps, you can go through them pretty quick. You can get through six a day.
Oh, yeah, sure, laugh it up. Everybody else did!
How could she leave us alone with this lunatic? Ten more minutes, and thats it! Im leaving. I have to tell you, this guy scares me.
Well, I'm not buying it. No way. Forget it. No way I'm buying this! (beat) I mean, look at it! What is it? It's a bunch of squiggly lines! (beat) Are you telling me you couldn't paint this?
Y'know what it is? It's "Clara Nightingale Syndrome." He falls ill; she falls in love.
Oh, it's gotta be fifty! Hee hee! You know how much Ted Danson makes, huh?
Well, if he can regift, why can't you degift?
Never mind. The're done. All I have to do now is redo them. You know if you take everything I've ever done in my entire life and condense it down into one day, it looks decent.
If only something like that could happen to me.
What kind of plastic do you think it is? What do you think like that dry cleaning plastic?
Well, they're more than an underwear to me Mr. Farkus. Two cups in the front, two loops in the back. How do they do it?
No, he doesn't know O'Brien, if he knew O'Brien he wouldn't have a sign. Let's just do it.
....But after that we really talked didn't we?
Oh, well th-that's great. It's really great. Hm hm mm.
You know, suddenly I'm in the mood for pasta primavera myself. (Jerry nudges George to sneak a peek at Molly's cleavage as she bends over and looks in her backpack. Jerry has a quick look, but George stares, hypnotized. Russell comes up behind George.)
I don't want to! I'm outta money! I got 714 dollars left in the bank.
Alright, still her father didn't have to throw me out like that, he could have just asked me to leave. The guy had me in a headlock! Susan's not going tonight you know.
Well I just got the estimate. It's going to cost more to fix that roof than the car's worth, So I'm going over to see that hospital administrator today. Someone is gonna pay for this damage and it's not gonna be me.
What? The guy asked you to HELP HIM MOVE? Wow.
Give me the phone. (dials) Yea, Hi I would like to speak to Patrice. ... what? ... oh really? ... oh, ok, thank you, ... (hangs up)
Oh good, good, come in. Come in, welcome. I'm George. And this is Jerry, over there, on the phone, that's Jerry. And you are, um?
Not everybody knows what the crop circles are. (to the newsstand owner) Do you know what the crop circles are?
By the way, have you spoken to Elaine yet today?
Yeah. (Noticing this makes him out to be the bad kid, he gets defensive) Well, I couldn't run over there the way I was!
I dunno, Jerry somethin's missing. There's a void, Jerry, there's a void...
Yeah. (clears his throat) We should do this again.
I was in the middle of a conversation.
Jerry? Yes, I suppose he is white. You know, I never really thought about it. I don't see people in terms of color. You know, there's someone I'd like you to meet. Hand on... (To phone) Is Mr. Morgan in?
I could have had some ice cream. I think that might have calmed down the nachos.
(Sarcastic) Yeah, yeah. I'm gonna move in with him. He doesn't even let you use the toilet!
I don't have a spare set. All my keys say 'do not duplicate'.
What do you think I mean bald? Bald. Bald bald.
Oh I beg to differ. My father took great pride in his appearance, he was a very handsome man, a casanova really.
I'll tell you something, I've never seen a pilot script as funny as this!
Her back went out. She's gotta be there for a couple of days. All she said on the way over in the car was, "Why, George, why?!".. I said, "Because it's there!"
Yeah. One second sweetheart. Jerry, I really think it'd be easier if you didn't tuck.
Do you feel funny? He didn't say anything.
Hey, when you order from the waitress, get her to point to the menu. I want to see what finger she uses.
No. She tried to give me the "it's not you, it's me" routine.
(doing the voice) Im slippery as an eel
Ha! (snort) Can you believe it? (amused) I'm supposed to be havin' lunch with her right now at Pomodoro.
Why don't you find a doctor that doesn't know your difficult.
That's perfect! He's a zoo guy! He take's care of animals. C-Can I bring the squirrel by?
She says she has to come to New York on business...
No something is bunk and then you debunk it.
Alright! Please, please! I cannot have this constant bickering!.. Stress is very damaging to the epidermis! Now, I have an important photo session in the morning - my hands have got to be in tip-top shape, so please - keep the television down, and the conversation to a minimum.
(As the Twix starts to move) Ha, ha, ha, ha! (The Twix gets stuck in the spindle right before falling. George begins to pound the machine) Come on! Jump!
(shouting) What happened to Soda?! I thought we all agreed on Soda.
Yeah for two hours. She's nuts about you.
Course, I wouldn't, I mean uh, the guy is uh, well obviously (to Cynthia, as she passes) the guy has his problems.
Ah, I've had everything on the menu. Uh, surprise me.
No! I don't! Don't you even care? This is your company! It's your name on the outside of the building! Speaking of which, the 'R' fell off and all it says now is K-uger!
Well there is traffic. It might take her till eight-fifteen.
It doesn't matter if it's more comfortable. It's wrong.
Look, we're not gonna be that long anyway... we have to get to the "party"!
Okay. "Breakfast At Tiffany's." (Begins to read, but gradually his attention is drawn to the TV Guide on the end table. George realizes there's a show on he wants to see by looking at his watch, and doesn't start the book.)
Well don't let him take advantage of you like that.
Well just take an overview. Can't you just take an overview?
Regardless. I had to walk around for the rest of the party in some cheap Metlife windbreaker. Now, it is payback time.
Like if she wants to know if I'm pleased with something, she'll say, "Happy, Pappy?"
(indicating the window) Kramer, it's, it's raining. They got the tarp on the field.
(Losing it) Don't tell me how to eat!
(still quiet) Never mind, never mind. I need you to do me a favour. Uhm, remember what we were talking about at the coffee shop earlier?
No, don't say a word. If she thinks my friends are jerks, then I'm a *jerk*...
I am eating my dessert. How do you eat it, with your hands?
Oh... (George looks around and sees the chef hiding behind a plant it's Bob!)
I have noticed she does tend to go to the bathroom right after we finish eating.
I don't know. Perhaps I can better serve the world this way.
...pianist. A *classical* pianist. She *plays* the piano. She's a *brilliant* woman. I-I-I sat in her living room... She played the *Waldstein Sonata*! The *Waldstein*!
Of course not. I mean sure, there may have been one or two occasions in the past, when I may have reacted in uh impulsive or somewhat immature manner, but those days are well behind me.
Yeah. Hey Jerry, listen to this. I discovered something even better than conjugal visit sex. Fugitive sex! Now, it's like everytime -
(hurriedly leaves Rudy's) They had plans, They had plans!
Wha? Did you use those? These are guest soaps! (he grabs the soaps and begins examining them for damage)
Shhh! Listen, you gotta do me a favor. Give me your wallet. I'll give it back to you later.
Oh, very refreshing. (Thinking again) Sex is like joining a private club. I'll be the same me tomorrow, but suddenly, the no trespassing sign will be gone.
(Angered) Fine. I'll ask you again when you're rested.
Look, Deena, I know you think I'm crazy, but I'm not. This is just a series of bad coincidences.
(Yelling out) It's my apartment, Eldridge! The Stalkholm may not have sunk ya, but I will! Ha, ha, ha!
I'm not paying for this. If you were going out with her, it'd be a different story.
(shaking hands with Morty) Morty, always a pleasure.
You know what the temperature in Florida is today? Eh? Seventy-nine. That's almost eighty. Yeah, I read someplace the life expectancy in Florida is eighty-one and in Queens, seventy-three.
I think you're right. You gonna eat that?
Get going? But we haven't really, you know....
I read somewhere that this Brentano's is the place to meet girls in New York.
The attic? Y-you haven't wore any of those clothes for years.
Well, we're collectors. We, uh, see objects of great beauty and, uh, we must have them.
'Just listen to the music of the traffic, in the city. Linger on the sidewalk, where the neon lights are pretty.' Where the neon lights are pretty. The Broadway area?
She doesn't Want to talk, she needs to talk.
I-I don't get these birds! They're breaking the deal. It-it's like the pigeons decided to ignore me!
Yes, because the water was cold... and the chewing warms me up.
I know enough to stay away from it.
Yeah, I'll zip in, "How do you do?", zip out. She'll love me.
There is no problem. . . just a small miscommunication. Whereby you thanked her instead of the person actually responsible for purchasing the big salad.
Oxygen! I need some oxygen! This is major.
Not with that big glass window looking out into the hall. I'd love a good nap. That's the only thing getting me out of bed in the morning. I'll see ya'.
I mean you're just, you're just a marvel of organization.
You know, they say ostrich has less fat, but you eat more of it.
But you are Blanche... You *are* in the shackles. Oh, I can't wait to read my *Time* magazine! Laaaast copy, too. Maybe I'll read it tomorrow-- in the park! It's supposed to be a beeyootiful day! Have a nice life... sentence, that is!
(holding his cane) I gotta hobble. (walks out)
I DON'T KNOW. It's this place. I'm very uncomfortable here.
(still looking at that picture) You know if I told my engagement story to that receptionist, but told her this, was my fiance..
I said faddah, I meant Father. Just a little bit nervous.
Whatever!!. . . . Oh oh oh this is unbelievable. This is better than my bed at home.
I'll tell ya, if I had one of these things, I'd be eatin' hot dogs all the time.
She's stickin' it to me that she makes more money than me.
I dont know. I cant believe theyre making me take this test.
I know. That's the point. If it's gonna get sexual, it should get sexual with you.
And the amazing thing is she eats like there's no tomorra'. I mean I've never seen an appetite like this. Desserts. Everything. I don't know how she does it.
My parents? They don't know *what's* goin' on...
(talking to nobody) Nah. It's probably a union thing.
(ahem) In this age of uncertainty and confusion, a man begins to ask himself certain questions. How can one even begin to put into words something so um (trying to think of a word)
Right, can we go? Cause Im double-parked, Im gonna get a ticket.
Oh, I'm goin' baby. I'm goin.' (Heads for the door, then stops.) It's Jerry's fault. He took out all my good lines. He's such a control freak!
(a little worried) He uh, he doesn't have the auto shop any more?
You heard the man. I guess you gotta be moving your car.
No. Semi-daily. Four or five times a week.
Morning Thunder has caffeine in it, Jerry doesn't drink caffeine.
I usually spend Saturday afternoons with Susan. She's gonna want to know what I'm doing. I can't use Jerry, he's in Florida.
What are you doing here? I thought you said you hated Isabella's?
(interrupts her) You know what. I don't think I'm going to be able to stay over tonight.
So concerned was he, that word of his poor tennis skills might leak out, he chose to offer you his wife as some sort of mediaeval sexual payola?
You see, this is what I do with women. I start out too strong, now I have to become real, that's when it all falls apart. What good is real? They don't want real, they want funny.
Oh, yes. I - I'm your baby bluey.
Hey. How come I didn't get a Christmas card? Everybody else got one. Jerry got one, Kramer got one. I thought we were good friends. I don't get a Christmas card. I don't get it.
Everybody's talkin' at me...I can't hear a word they're sayin'...just drivin' around in Jon Voight's car...
She invites me up at twelve oclock at night, for coffee, and I dont go up. No thank you. I dont want coffee. It keeps me up. Too late for me to drink coffee. I said this to her. People this stupid shouldnt be allowed to live. I cant imagine what she must think of me.
Heh, haa. And that's no good. I've tried it straight, Jerry. We've all seen the results. For me, sick is the only way to go.
As you care for me. Which is why it is very important that you never breathe a word of this to anyone about the... you know. What, with Clarence Thomas and everything.
I've done that. Did you ever eat an ostrich burger?
Your clothes smell just like Pisano's. There's another Italian place on Jerome. Maybe I can fool him.
(panicked and rushed) Jerry! The Japanese guys had sake in the hot-tub! You gotta get 'em outta the drawers and get 'em down here, or I don't have a focus group to sell the pilot to Japanese TV!
The show will be like a heart attack!
Well, it's just a game. Remember that, kids.
Oh, right, right, the intervention. Should we leave?
Dad, the hinges are all rusted here. That's why the wind keeps blowing the door off.
No no no, he's not getting away with this.
Listen Sheila it's not what you think. I put my trust into the wrong person. He said the key word was tasteful.
me too, I am down, I am totally down, mark me down
Oh, no no, I cant go back there. Jerry, its so awkward and, you know, it could be dangerous sexually. Something could happen, Id be right back where I started from.
(Let down) Yeah, but you - you promised it to me.
Listen Jerry. With all due respect, Bania's voice is the voice of a new generation. My generation.
Right, I got news. You ready? (deep breath) Gary Fogel had cancer.
Missing his plane? Wasn't that a charter flight?
Oh, so now I have to buy this whole chair by myself?
Jerry, let me tell you something, "A man without hand is not a man." I got so much hand I'm coming out of my gloves. I got to thank Kramer.
Boy! What a story! I'm speechless. Speechless. I have no speech.
(smitten) Audrey? My god, you look incredible! I can't believe it!
Well I just stomped some pigeons in the park. They - they didn't move.
(clears throat) Maura, I, uh- I want you to know... I-I've given this a lot of thought. I'm sorry, but... we, uh, we have to break up.
Oh, I love full lips. Something you can really put the lipstick on.
--Astroturf? You know who's responsible for that, don't you?! The Jews! Ah, the Jews hate grass. They always have, they always will.
Well, you know, I shouldn't have let you into Kramer's, now you want to go into Elaine's...she entrusted me with her spare keys, how can I just let you in?
I feel like a huge weights been lifted off my shoulders. I... I... I feel happy! Kramer, I dont know how to thank you!
Well, I'll tell you, Stacey. It's a lot of hard work. But, it comes fairly easy to me. Some people write symphonies. This is my gift. (Raises ski lift ticket while Stacey looks away)
And then, (Smacks the money) there were two.
Oh, come on. What, are you kidding? GEORGE I'm much more comfortable criticizing people behind there backs. Anyway, look who's talking. You just broke up with with Melanie last week because she "shuushed you" while you were watching TV.
Well, Jerry. There was a pretty good chance I was never gonna have sex again anyway.
This must be Sheila from the photo place.
Thanks a lot. I'm really late. My parents are waiting in front of my building and we're stuck here.
What do you know? You were in the nut house.
Flying him in? How longs he staying for?
(chuckles) Really? Well, we'll just see about that. Ta-ta, Tut-tle.
Yeah, I'm a great quitter. It's one of the few things I do well. I come form a long line of quitters. My father was a quitter, my grandfather was a quitter... I was raised to give up.
Did I tell you?! Did I tell you?!
Well, Play Now has all kinds of different rubber balls. Why dont we test your bladder system at my office?
I'm just gonna...wash. (George walks to the bathroom; screaming) WHY DID I PUT UP TWO? WHY DID I PUT UP TWO?
No, I'm not. I would like to be, but I'm not. What am I gonna do? The book club meets in a few days.
Uh, yes, uh...you don't know me, my name is George Costanza...did you happen to rent Breakfast At Tiffany's?
All right, all right, I didnt want to tell you this. You wanna know why she called you?
Yeah I guess. What can I do? I gotta take her with me. Todd introduced us, I'm obligated.
I am not putting it in a garage, it's my space.
All I know about is sports. That's it. No matter how depressed I get, I could always read the sports section.
Not a plane crash. (leaving) Is it a plane crash?
(Takes two oven mitts from his back pack) Alright, (puts them on) I gotta get going.
Well I think I'm better off going one-on-one.
Does that mean I have to go too?
(crafty) Not necessarily. Why don't you take back the couch you gave me?
I'm a college graduate. You want me to be a mailman?
I left three messages. I can't believe this woman. She has sex with me, leaves ten minutes later then I never hear from her again. What kind of a person does this? I mean, she used me. I feel cheap and violated.
That's where I come in. Umm, on splat. Uh, you see, Mrs. Sweedler, or is it hospital administrator Sweedler?
So--ah, Kramer. Why'd you ask me out to dinner? (amused) An' why Pomodoro?
Yeah, yeah, me to miss -- I miss.
I tell you something. I wish there were pig-men. You get a few of these pig-men walking around suddenly I'm looking a whole lot better. Then if somebody wants to fix me up at least they could say, "Hey he's no pig-man!"
(Yelling out to a waitress) Gonna need some water here!
I just wanted to talk to Tony for a minute (hands Elaine some stuff)
I think I understand this. Jay Peterman is real. His biography is not. Now, you Kramer are real.
Ten minutes! Here, here, (Fishes a box of Tic-Tacs out of his coat pocket and tosses them to her) Have some Tic-Tacs.
Funny, cause I happen to be very good friends with Keith Hernandez.
(waving) How can I not think about it? Look at the size of this thing.
(hanging up) All right, Jerry. I'll do it. See ya.
I mean, uh... I had fun ice skating.
Ill eh, Ill just have a bowl of chili.
I don't know. A little thing called Step Nine? Instead of an apology, he was beboppin' and scattin' all over me.
Whats seventy-five bucks?! What, am I seeing Sinatra in there?! Am I being entertained? I dont understand this. Im only paying half.
Yeah, woman have no problem getting the hand off. How do they do that?
No, Kramer. I have to have this statue.
You shook my hand in that coffee shop.
Nougat? Please. I think Ive reached the point in my life where I can tell the difference between nougat and cookie. So lets not just say things that we both know are obvious fabrications.
You know she was behind the idea. She was going to champion the show. That's what I was bring her up there to tell you. And she liked me.
Reprogram all the buttons, see if he changes them back. You know? The old switcheroo.
Yeah, let him chew on that for a while.
So we started drinking, and I'll tell you I don't know if it was the alcohol or the ammonia, but the next think I knew she was mopping the floor with me.
Nah, the cable's out. What's with you? You look dead.
I don't know how you can let this guy handle all your money.
Jerry it's funny, Paula and I actually met because of Elaine.
Pardon me, I went to see your friend Dwayne... there was no discount.
Ade, ahh, ahh, ah ... Im giving you a raise!
I don't think we should see each other any more.
(leaving to the bedroom) I gave it to Cosmo.
Well, I know when I'm a little strapped, I sometimes drop off my rent check having forgotten to sign it. That could buy us some time.
So call her up and tell her to bring you another one. She'll be delighted to talk to you.
[quite out loud, not even pretending to whisper] Elaine!
I watched "Beaches" on cable last night. (wings?)  Give me a break.
Come on. Come check out my new place. It'll take you two minutes.
You're fresh (grabs her arm) You're very fresh. You seem very fresh to me. You're very vital. I couldn't take you any fresher.
My parents don't read! They're gonna wonder what a book is doing on the table!
I'm bored. She's boring, I'm boring, we're both boring. We got out to eat, we both read newspapers.
I was jumping over a puddle, and for some reason I went like this. (George stretches out his arms in a ballet motion) And they called me a Mary. So I chased them, and I tripped and I fell.
*I* think that *you* think that a certain *something* is not all that it could be, when in fact it is is all that it *should* be, and *more*!
I should've hit the little son-of-a-bitch. I can't stand kids. Adults think it's so wonderful how honest kids are. I don't need that kind of honesty. I'll take a deceptive adult over an honest kid any day.
It's like Im thinking of something, and you're (snaps fingers) one step ahead of me.
Well, what was I supposed to do? Get out of the shower, put on my bathrobe? Go all the way down to the other end? Come all the way back?
Yeah, so what? I'm not the only one! (Kramer enters with his quilt.)
Not me. Everything should be negotiable. (he picks up a container of fruit)
I haven't even met the fiancee! Whatever! (Leaves for washroom)
I want you to have this job. Of course...
(really animated) Alright, alright. You see? This is why I hate writing with a large group. Everybody has their own little opinions, and it all gets homogenised, and you lose the whole edge of it. I'm going with jerk store! Jerk store is the line! Jerk store! Yess!
We did a crossword puzzle together, *in bed*. It was the most fun I ever had in my entire life. Did you hear me? in my *life*! Y'know?
Forget about smelling the car. Smell the valet. Go to the source...
We could build a cabin like (Snaps) that.
This is like a Penthouse letter...Why can't I meet women like this?
You know, I'm sorry, I...I hate to be one of those people, but we're right in the middle of this thing...I can't hear.
Up again?! This is incredible! Im.. Im getting it.
Okay, okay. Look, you do all the talking, okay?
What, is that the one your parents gave you?
Makes the 11 gauge look like a cap pistol.
Oh oh oh, all right, fine, Jerry, you win. Take it, just take it!
No, no. I reached down and there was *nothing* there.
he's the first cool guy I've ever been friends with in my whole life. You know.. it's a different world when you're with a cool guy, he's not afraid of anybody. You should hear the way he talks to waitresses.. he gets free pie!
Mr. Morgan! Did you hear that? Mr. Morgan!
What if I want to walk around a little?
(Yelling out, frustrated. The camera spins from a top angle) Twwwwiiiiiixxxxx!
Yeah, yeah, yeah we could. You know, ah, Kramer, the next time you talk to her, find out if she knows Kelly, from Monk's. I wanna know if she really has a boyfriend.
So you're telling me instead of them being happy to see me, they're going to be upset because I didn't bring anything. Ttst --You see what I'm saying?
( rubbing his eye) Ow, Ow you squirted me.
Hey, you know, we haven't brought the Elaine character into the show yet. Umm, We should try and get her into this scene.
I tried to tear it from the side, you can't get a good grip here. You gotta do it like a bag of chips.
(rising to his feet) Hey! Hey, you! (setting off after her) Come back here!! Don't gallop away!!
(hesitant) Uh, Mr Wilhelm. Uh, about the project...
Unless she goes for the bathroom. Thats my only chance. (George crumbles. He drops the cassette on the table.) Who am I kidding? I cant do this, I cant do this. I dont even know how to work those stupid machines.
(more excitement) You were gonna fix me up with her?
Can I say one word to you? Lobster. The lobster here is unbelievable. (looks at the menu) Ooh, a little expensive.
(annoyed) Hes an importer/exporter, okay? (beat) Elaine ever call you back?
Those birthdays. I told you. They're relationship killers. If a relationship is having any problems whatsoever, a birthday will always bring it out.
Anyway, so he gave me his spare keys, now he wants to have my keys, so I need mine back from you.
With all due respect, I don't think so...
Give me two bucks. Ill do it for two bucks.
What ever they had. Miranda thinks I'm a butcher but i-i-it's not my fault is it? Don't we have a deal with the pigeons?
So you thought she was good looking and figured this would be a good way to meet her.
We got a soccer game in Chile. Anyway, the plane crashes. Who are you gonna eat to survive?
[Realizing full well it isn't] ...Yes it is.
Tim, who's the head of the Aryan Union, you or me?
Kramer, listen to me. I'm never gonna have a child. If I lose this Frogger high score, that's it for me.
(Puts his arms in the air, stretching, and covers his mouth with an arm) Could you ask her, just ask her. If she says no, case closed.
Puke! That's a funny word. Puke. (laughing) Puke! Don't have to think about that.
Of course, the uh, the four passes. (closes partition) Four passes to Madison Square Garden? Wait a minute. Wait a minute! Of course! Chicago! The Knicks are playing the Bulls tonight!
It's standard. Has she left you one of those messages where she uses up the whole machine?
Let me just say this. It is inhumane to make a man stand on his feet, in one spot for eight hours a day. Why shouldn't he have a chair?
Yeah. A couple of people. I don't get that, though. Where do you start?
I don't know if you're ready for it.
Well, if I hear you correctly--and I think that I do--my advice to you is to finish your meal, pay your check, leave here, and never mention this to anyone again.
I don't like it, it's red. It it's too flashy.
(Not sure what the answer should be) What do you want to hear?
Gary? Well, well, well well. Where the hell've you been? I've been leaving you phone messages for months.
The government is very touchy about us being in the air. Let us run around on the ground as much as we want. Anything in the air is a big production.
Nothing, I... said it was a little problem.
Come on, lets not stand here too long, we might run in to her.
I saw Amy making out with your cousin Jeffrey.
I know, I know...don't skimp. Go go go go...
(upset) Could you put a little thought into this? Jerry's gone, you could humour me. He humours me.
I told you those trips were relationship killers. Too bad you cant get your buddy Superman to fly around the Earth at super speed and reverse time. Youd get all the money back, you could have avoided the whole trip to Vermont...
I am. The folks are twelve hundred miles away. (gleeful) I'm basking in the buffer zone. (looks for the waitress) 'Nother piece of pie here!
(grabs the phone quick) Got it, Got it,...Hello?
Hi. I-I really should be getting back to my fianc, you know, we, uh, we had this big fight yesterday and, uh, well she, she wants to-to know my secret code. I-I don't know, I can't tell her. The funny thing is, you know, I would really love to tell someone 'cause it's killing me. You uh, you wanna know what it is? It's Bosco. You know, the chocolate syrup? I love that stuff, I pour it in milk, it's my favorite drink. Hoo-hoo, boy, that is a relief!
You know, I think we really need to be in front of a television set. You take T.V. out of this relationship, it is *just* torture.
I can't perform under pressure. That's why I never play anything for money, I choke. I could choke tonight. And she works in my office, can you imagine? She goes around telling everyone what happened? Maybe I should cancel, I have a very bad feeling about this.
"There may be a problem with the phone, hold on"!
That's a shame. (Karen is shown singing off-key on the television.)
My moneys all tied up in change right now.
So do I, but I wouldn't hang it on a wall.
(to Susan's stone) ...And then, right after the All-Star Break, we, we just swept the Orioles. Four games. In Baltimore. (adjusts necktie nervously) So... yeah.
She tolerated the strawberries and the chocolate sauce, but eh, it's not a meal, you know? Food and sex, those are my two passions. It's only natural to combine them.
I think I was affected by the caffeine.
" I'll always be a winner and you'll always be a loser." This is what he said to me.
I was trying to loosen 'em up a little bit.
Listen. Let me ask you something. If you and Mona were ever to... dance, how do you decide who leads? I mean... do you take turns? Do you discuss it beforehand? How does that work?
But Kramer, isn't it a question of hygiene?
Y'know, the funny thing is, somehow I find her more appealing now... It's like if I knew she was a lesbian when we went out, I never would've broken up with her.
Well, Dr, Allenwood, uh...I was hoping to compile an - admittedly, rudimentary - scrapbook of her life. Something that Betsy could have, and hold onto.
Uh-huh. And how much does the healer charge?
Loves bald? (laughs) Wow. Who uh, who is she?
What? Oh I spilled some food on it.
No-no-no, we all chipped in. We have the money.
(laughs) Youd have to be a real loser to try something like that.
Well we were all eating the raisins. And I remember you--you were eating some of the raisins. And then you left, and the raisins were gone. And I was just wondering if, you know (chuckles), maybe you took them with you.
Now she thinks we're gay, not that there's anything wrong with it...
She told this couple she had an affair with a matador.
(to Jerry) Why dont you just turn it inside out?
(to the saleswoman) You know honey for an unadvertised sale, you're doing a lot of yapping about it.
We're perfect. I timed this out so we would pull up at the terminal *exactly* 17 minutes after their flight is supposed to land. That gives them just enough time to get off the plane, pick up their bags and be walking *out* of the terminal as we roll up. I tell you, it's a thing of beauty. I can not express to you the feeling I get from a perfect airport pickup. (starts looking around) What's going on? What are you doing? The Long Island Expressway? What are you getting on the Long Island Expressway for? Do you know what the traffic will be like? This is a suicide mission!
Did you explain to her about the good naked and the bad naked?
(getting animated) Yeah. Yeah. You know the odds of me being anyone's type?! I have never been anyone's type, but apparently, this Marisa Tomei loves funny, quirky, bald men.
(Slowly shakes his head) My mother caught me.
I think I like the girl better than the voice.
Elaine, bald men, with no jobs, and no money, who live with their parents, don't approach strange women.
Why does everything have to be 'us'? Is there no 'me' left? Why can't there be some things just for me? Is that so selfish?
(sidling in) Is this a bad time? I hope I'm not disturbing anything.
(angry undertone) Oh, I'm gonna give you a Royal bearing. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Lemme get a pack of gum here.
Yeah, Well that's a deal where I come from.
Please, it doesnt look good. Boy, boy, girl.
You know. You use the, uh...(mutters something unintelligible under his breath.)
I just popped in now. I'm a big pop-in guy.
All right. All right. Let's not get into panic mode! Let's not make a big deal outta this thing or we're never gonna get through this night.
Aw great. Now the volume knob fell off
They wish. I hate the big broker-houses. Hate them with a passion. Big broker-houses killed my father.
No, no, no, no. Borrowing money from a friend is like having sex. It just completely changes the relationship.
(to Jerry) You watch the old videos. (insistent) I'm telling you, look at him.
Oh, he'll be here. By the way, Elaine, (reaches under the table and brings out a large coffee machine) thank you for laying out for the Arabian mocha java.
Fine. Steal the battery. Now, all right, here is the Frogger. This is the front door, and this is the outlet.
(cuts into Jerry talking) Chocolate chip mint? Oh well, actually Jerry I prefer chocolate chip. What is it about the chocolate and the mint that makes it go so well together?
Well you know, if you were sitting right next to her you'd have to console her no matter what.
You have any idea how fast these things deteriorate when there's an 'I love you' out of the bag? You can't have a relationship where one person says, "I love you", and the other says, "I'm hungry. Let's get something to eat.".
She cant even afford to go out to lunch. She's been eating in a high school cafeterias She pretends to be a teacher. It's pathetic.
Hey could you do one other thing for me?
Alright. 7,7, (points at himself) 6. I'm not gonna eat that much!
Jerry took the flyers off the car, I got the whole thing covered.
She kept such a nice clean apartment. She was so sanitary.
Is she the only girl in the whole world? Why can't you get find your own girl?
(incredulous) I look just like him. I. Me. (flings his arms out) This! This is what her boyfriend looks like. How is that possible?
Oh, please ... ... four dollars is f...
He's got Marlon Brando's. I could go to Marlon Brando's house if I really wanted.
He can be pedantic. He can be pedantic.
Anyway, I-I would like to-to pay for the cleaning.
(Turning back to Jerry, he takes the check back. He just now notices the shirt Jerry's wearing, and snickers, pointing) Nice shirt.. (Laughs, Jerry shrugs) What is this? Is this what you wore on the show?
(Trying to keep it down) Because I like this one! (Notices people staring at him, he quickly gets up, collecting the his coat and the tiny replica) C'mon, let's go. Let's go! (On his way out, he stops in front of a woman blocking his path) Oh, hi.. (Embarrassed about the doll, he sheepishly walks out)
Oh no, in and out, I made sure of that. And you'll be happy to know I perused the script and it's met with my approval.
C'mon Jerry, let's go. What was that all about?
(Staring at the doll) This doll (Pointing) looks like my mother.
Nothing. Uh, I don't know. I gotta go.
Oh. This I need. Hello!! Hello. i..i..is this the hair restoration clinic? ...Does anyone speak English?
I can't believe she got involved with a shrink.
Jerry! I need you to get another picture of man-hands. I'm beggin' you!
Oh, no no no. Course not. I got a great name for our kids. A real original. You wanna hear what it is? Huh, you ready?
What, you're gonna pass up a wonderful opportunity to put that aloe pusher in her place?
Theres no way I touch that bag for less than two dollars.
I think I got it. How 'bout this? How 'bout this? We trade Jim Leyritz and Bernie Williams, for Barry Bonds, huh? Whadda ya think? That way I have Griffey and Bonds, in the same outfield! Now you got a team! Ha ha ha.
I bawled uncontrollably. I just poured my guts out. And I'll tell you, Jerry, it was incredible. I never realized how powerful these tears are. I could have postponed it another five years if I wanted to.
Excuse me sir. Would you mind watching my bag for a minute?
(frantic) Oh, Jerry Jerry Jerry Jerry Jerry, listen, if, if you are feeling uncomfortable about this at all, at all. Do not feel like you have to take it.
And she didn't say something to you about a certain something?
I insist. Ill fix us a drink. (phone rings  who would that be?) I got it.
Geez, Hey you know something, you should try my friend's wake up service. She swears by this thing.
'Kay. I'll uh, I'll see you later. Anybody want some tomatoes?
No...Why should that make any difference to you?
(knocks) You hem... wanted to see me Mr. Steinbrenner?"
See, didn't bother Susan either. That's why I'm different. I can sense the slightest human suffering.
All right, look. I'm getting the Chow Fung. You don't have to have any.
Yes, In fact, her mother is in the hospital right now. It's some kind of a Diverticulitis. (he continues walking slowly towards Steinbrenners desk)
No wait, you can't just leave me here! Will I see you again?
Yeah, now I gotcha! (hangs up the phone and rushes out the door)
Well... what if you showed up bad naked, huh? You still got that belt sander?
Just take it off. I'm getting hot just looking at it.
I was doing standup comedy in Kennebunkport Maine. ??? night club. The stage was on a cliff and the audience was throwing all the comics off.
No one's putting a gun to your head. Do I, uh, scare you?
(whistles disapprovingly) Ho ho ho, Had to? Had to come in?
Yeah, yeah. You gotta come over tonight. We can play.
No you wouldn't. Nobody would. It's just that... they were missing, and... well I'm just inquiring. (chuckles nervously)
You know what I would like to do? I would really like to have sex with a tall woman. I mean really tall. Like a like a giant Like six five.
(Long pause) ..Felt like it. I tell you, this doll is pretty spooky. (Takes off his glasses, rubbing his eye) It's freakin' me out man. And now I got to go back out there and pick up this doormat.
I tell you this. If the real Phil Rizzuto was down there, this wouldn't be happening!
Hey, I'm his nephew, all right? Don't worry about it. Go ahead. Check it out.
The... drivel... parts. Oh my gosh, I just realized  I have to make a phone call. I-I cant believe- Would you-
try shaking it...(long pause) Well,Janet should be here any minute.
(Reflecting on his life gone wrong) This McKigney guy had a few good years.. (To Kramer, bitter) How could you forget to turn off an iron?
Could we talk about this some other time?
Greetings, people. Greetings. Greetings and salutations. What a beautiful day for a ball game. Let's play two! (Sits down, says to waitress ) Oh, I'll have the chicken salad on rye, my usual, you know what I get, darlin'. (Turns to the Gang) So, let's see, I had a little conversation today with Mr Don Mattingly - (to Elaine) he's the first base man.
I told her I liked her. Why? Why did I tell her I like her? I have this sick compulsion to tell women how I feel. I like you I dont tell you.
So, Marcy, you should've seen me in the hot tub yoday.
Oh really. You tell her you shaved it?
(urgent whisper) Elaine! You have got to get me Marisa Tomei's phone number!
They're worse! They're much worse than us, they talk about everything! Couldn't you at least tell her about the shrinkage factor?
But I digress. Let me see, now. You were standing at one end of the line and I was right next to you. And I remember we were even for like, the first five yards and then , BOOM,...You were gone.
Hi! Mr. West, this is my friend Elaine--
Well I was just going to wander the streets. Don't wanna tag along with you or anything.
"These pretzels are making me thirsty"? That was one line! You got fired!
The whole time that I was growing up, all I ever heard from my mother was 'Why can't you be more like that Lloyd Braun?'
Well, it wouldn't fit you. The sleeves are too short.
Maybe it's not even stupidity. Maybe it's just a blatant disregard for basic human decency. Yeah this how dictator's start. Do you think Mussolini would circle the block six times looking for a spot?
Oh yeah! Middle finger, straight up, at me! At us!
I been, uh, thinking about the family. Tell me, uh, about Aunt Baby.
Yes! Because it is the mature, adult thing to do.
Because, if you ever see her and it comes up, we have to be in sync. Hmm?
Yeah well, they won't know. I got the car there.
(forced buoyancy) Hey, you know, let's call Susan, we'll go have coffee.
Oh right, right! The blue sweatpants! Gees, it's too bad you can't say anything because of Angela.
Do you wanna talk about hotels, or do you wanna win some ball games?
Yeah! Look at me! I was free and clear! I was living the dream! I was stripped to the waist, eating a block of cheese the size of a car battery!
Oh man! I knew I was gonna love the opera.
Ladies and gentlemen, this (Opens the door, Steven is standing there) is Steven Koren. His G.P.A. is a solid 2.0! Right in that meaty part of the curve - not showing off, not falling behind.
I will never understand the bathrooms in this country. Why is it that the doors on the stalls do not come all the way down to the floor?
I'll tell you something, if I'd own a company, my employees would love me. They'd have huge pictures of me up on the walls and in their home, like Lenin.
Oh, well, I'm sure you can reach her...she's a poet. What does a poet need an unlisted number for?
(urgent) Mr Wilhelm, listen. You've been abducted! Please, Mr Wilhelm, you gotta listen to me!
I gotta get to Fowler. I know that he would take this squirrel off my hands. It's practically bionic!
Yeaah, beautiful... (They try to hit a high five, but George hits Elaine in the forehead.) Sorry...
When is it going to be my turn, Jerry? When do I get my 15 minutes? I want my 15 minutes!
Oh, this isn't even B.O.! This is *beyond* B.O.! It's *B*.B.O.!
I had the perfect situation here, he was shouldering half the load.
She happens to be very good friends with her.
One little wink. She'll freak out, tell my parents. They'll be all over me. Who is this guy?
Why don't you just look at your watch?
(frustrated) Take it easy! Huh! Take it easy!
(excited) Did I tell you that story's relatable?! That was a great show! That is why I'm bringing it back to NBC.
Let me be the architect! I can do it!
Not a bad way to make a buck.
You, uh, you like baseball? [picks up baseball from desk]
All my life I've dreamed of sitting front row, behind the dugout!
Oh, its a great place, its uh two-bedroom uh, west 83rd bout half block from the park.
Hey, I'm sorry, you had your buffer zone for many years. It's my turn to live, baby.
Nah, he didn't have anything to do with it...
He didnt do anything, Jerry. Its a scam! Who told you to do that?
Yes. Live, dammit. Live! Every precious moment as if this was the last year of your life. Because in many ways...it is. (There's a knock at the door.) Excuse me.
I'm not going to break a hundred on this thing.
Boy, she is nice. I like her, I like her Jerry. She's got substance. She oozes substance.
Oh, you know, Lloyd, I really don't have it.
Hey, there's a tomato stand, let's stop, I can get some more.
I can't go in there. I can't face the bubble boy.
I'll pay you for your time....I just ..I just need some information . How much do you want? ten....fifteen? You have change for twenty?
I am. Im a nice guy. And she seduced me! We were in my apartment, Im sitting on the couch, shes on the chair. I get up to go to the bathroom, I come back, shes on the couch. What am I supposed to do? Not do anything? I couldnt do that. I wouldve insulted her.
(hearing Elaine over the phone) What, she's out?
Because I know him too, and probably a lot better than you.
Aw, hoh, oh Deena, thank God. (he hugs Deena) Thank God you're here. Listen, you gotta help me. You gotta tell these people that I'm okay. You know that I don't belong in here.
Tell you what, I'll make a deal with you. I'll sell it to you right now for ten bucks.
I can't eat this without catsup. Would it kill her to check up on us? Would that be a terrible thing? "How's everything? Do you need anything? What can I do for you?"
Plans. Schemes. She ah, she keeps talking about getting back together with her old friends, you know - "the gang," as she likes to call them (chuckles), you know. Yeah, they're eh, they're hatching something, you can count on that.
A plane crash? A Heart attack? Lupus? Is it Lupus?
Oh, nothin' much, . . . talkin'. . . . Oh, oh, oh, did I have an unbelievable idea today!
Oh, sure. I mean, after all, you were almost my, uh... OK, I gotta go.
Yeah. (Jerry nodding) ... Oh, you think because of what I said about the manure. I wa, wa, was just saying how it takes a negative thing, and puts it on a positive spin on it.
(Losing it) I guess everyone here enjoys giving the old screwgie, huh?! Youre all doin a hell of a job! (Looks longingly at the Twix in the machine) Ho, ho. What I would do with you..
That's him over there. The one that looks like a blowfish.
I never tasted a cough medicine I didn't love.
Look at that. They got lobster on the menu. Who would order a lobster here. I mean, do they bring a lobster in everyday hoping *todays* the day.
(standing) Yes, payroll. Yes I did. Very productive. Payroll... Paid off.
Know him? Would you, uh, like to meet him?
First time in my life I've ever gotten back at someone.
Yeah!, a doodle of me...look at the size of the nose , the ears, all my features are distorted.
Great! Great! I actually just had two meaningful intelligent conversations with Corbin Bernsen and George Wendt.
Well, I'm the good boy again. Can you believe that?
So, I've got ice cream all over my face. There were no napkins there. Whoever it was that's responsible for stocking that concession stand cost me a relationship.
(on the answering machine) Jerry, what's happening? Come on, pick up the phone.
Take care. Take it easy. (Tom leaves with the casting director)
She's off. (goes over to the now available public phone)
How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria?
I believe that I am about to become the target of a systematic process of intimidation and manipulation, the likes of which you have never -
Can I uh, can I walk you back to work?
Then I asked her if she wanted a drink.
(crestfallen) But you said it was my call.
Well I didnt do it for my mother.
Y'know people, we got a situation over here!
No, that's not enough BTUs for my living room...That was a complete waste of time.
Perhaps. (hehe) I walk in, everything is organized -- messages, appointments. And I can't tell you how proud I am of myself for going with Ade.
No, no, no. Just lately, I've been thinking a lot clearer. Like this afternoon, (To television) what is chicken Kiev, (Back to Jerry) I really enjoyed watching a documentary with Louise.
Thats it! Thats it! I cant take it. I cant take it anymore! You stole the statue! Youre a theif! Youre a liar!
I dunno. I guess I have to wait for her to die.
Oh, yeah, me too, me too. Boy oh boy oh boy...! You know, in fact, I've been thinking about it, and I feel like I'm stealing from you! Five-hundred dollars! It's gonna be worth thousands soon! You know what? On second thought, I can't even accept it.
No No I'm working on a system...Who was that?
So go ahead pigeons. hu hu hu. Laugh it up. I'm getting in my car now and the last I heard ... we have NO DEAL!
Yeah, yeah. Speaking of crazy, did you hear about Lloyd Braun?
Oh, real good. (George makes a face like you stink) Any word from NBC?
I dont think theres ever been an appointment in my life where I wanted the other guy to show up. (George notices an elderly man in a leather chair.) Wait a second, is that him?
Actually, (George flips the book back to the beginning) I'll take these nice glossy ones.
'scuse me. I uh, I was in here this morning and uh, I believe I paid you with a twenty dollar bill, (smiles) but you only gave me change for a ten.
(answering the phone while walking away) Joe Mayo's apartment?
She didn't want to come, she-she's not really into sports.
Wow, he really does a number on you. (reads) "Seinfeld froze like a deer in the headlights in the face of incessant heckling."
Is this the ticket holders line, or the buyers?
"It's the Kom Pau ... George likes his chicken spicy."
(Snaps, then points to the coffee table) Hand me an Emory board.
Ah, and I got a date with the sales woman. She's got a little Marisa Tomei thing going on.
Since when is Elaine's boyfriend selling cars? I thought he was a mechanic.
They send me? Aw right ..ask 'em Does it really work?
(getting up out of his chair to get out of the Mohel's way) No, No.
Ok, ok, fine! It's changed, it's not really the point. Anyway, I'm thinking of making a big move.
No, you're gonna sit down, you son of a gun...
Woo! Courtside! (mock-snide) Is that the best you could do? Ha ha!
If my parents had a mantel, I might be a completely different person.
It's like going to the bathroom in front of a lot of people and not caring.
(to Jerry) "You know those shoes that Jimmy had? I cut a deal with him. We're gonna import a case of them together."
. . . I thought the woman was kind of cute.
You told David Putty your move and you didn't tell *me*? I *need* a move. You know I have no moves, Jerry. (points to the candy bar) Gimme a bite.
'Scarsdale surprise'. That's the musical about that Scarsdale diet doctor murder.
I think things were going ok. We were having a nice conversation.
But I know who took the bite. It was her aunt!
Really? (Jerry shakes his head) Maybe this will become like a cool thing, living with your parents.
Does she care? No. Does anyone ever display the slightest sensitivity over the problems of a fellow individual? No. No. A resounding no!
Every woman on the face of the earth has complete control of my life. And yet, I want them all.. is that irony?
I'm at the health club and while I'm in the pool, some guy walks off with my glasses. Who steals prescription glasses?
(to the executives) Excuse me. Did you hire the Sunshine Carpet Cleaners?
You know, I think I could have played with dolls if their were dolls in the house. It seems like fun to me. It doesn't seem like a gender thing. I think I would like to play with dolls. What's so terrible?
(Leading Nina out the airport) Oh, no. No. We're good. Let's get goin'. Alright. (Almost bumps into Jerry) Watch it, funny man. (Leaves)
(shouting) I'm not looking for another line. I got the line.
Oh, sure. Sure, anything. Can you believe it? There's nothing wrong with me.
All righty, no reason for us to uh, raise our voices.
Well let me hear....( they struggle for the headphones)
Stop it! It's nothing. It's a stupid holiday my father invented. It doesn't exist!
Hey Deena, come on, give us a hug. (they hug) Oh my gosh, you look as pretty as you did back in high school.
Jerry! Jerry! Je Jerry Jerry . The most unbelievable thing has just happened, it's too Unbelievable! I'm sitting in the coffee shop, i'm talking to Susan, were talking about shoe laces (does two guns to the head) so in walks..in walks David, right, he walks right to the table..righ I introduced him to Susan..and he says get this (laughs) he says 'boy you could do a lot better than this guy' huh right (more laughing by George, Jerry is totally just mellow and straight faced) The exact same thing that I said to him, just to get back at me just to get back at me..and then, and then she says she wants to be alone for awhile..Alone Jerry! I think that she thinks that she could do better (laughs) Do you appreciate this? Do you see the irony of this? Do you see what is going on here? What's the matter?
(contemptuously, imitating Altons voice) Hes in the bathroom.
Oh, right! (Shakes her hand) Right! Hey, hey.. I love the floors in here. It's like a gymnasium in here! Try and guard me! (Dribbles an imaginary ball
What d'you mean, let 'em go? They're spending all my money.
It's this way... AND THEY TAKE OFF AGAIN, PAIRING OFF
Yeah, like I'm going to risk my job with the New York Yankees to make a few extra bucks. (winks)
(pause) Alright if you think it's too much they don't have to mail the postcards.
It's a little unusual. So, uh, Susan and I were thinking, uh, dinner at our house Saturday night. Just the four of us.
He's getting phone calls here now? (he's standing near the counter and eating chips out of a big bag)
I've been standing here for the last ten minutes!
This is by far the most exciting thing I've ever done.
No, she's taking this course in education for her masters. It's part of her research project, so I have to be a guinea pig.
(ON PHONE) It's a '76 Chevy Impala. They stole it right in front of the hospital. I saw the guy drive off in it. Well he's about five feet tall, hairless, pink complexion.. (Elaine puts her finger on her nose) looks like a pig. Yeah, alright alright, thank you, thank you. (Kramer enters) So any word from the "pig-man"?
What are you kidding? We look great! You know what this pudding needs? The skin on the top, you know like your mother used to make it on the stove.
(Standing up) I just got here, Ma! I'd like to spend a little time with you.
Well hello. Um, ah, specifically the reason that I'm here, uh, I don't know uh what Elaine told you but uh I broke up with my girlfriend a couple of weeks ago. Actually she broke up with me [struggling with his coat zipper] and uh, well, I was the cause of it and uh, I just wanted to find out from you ... What's with this thing?
Sperry Rand Building. 14th floor, Morgan Apparel. Mention my name - she'll give you the key.
Remember when you came to audition for us?
(Elaine walking down the hall they notice her and wave her into the room) Elaine! Get! (She enters)
Oh, I had no choice. She squeezed it out of me! Shed tell me she loved me. All right, at first, I just look at her. Id go, Oh, really? Or uh, Boy, thats, thats something. But, eventually you have to come back with, Well, I love you. You know, you can only hold out for so long.
I know, I know, I can't stop it!
Okay, uh, look, if you want to just keep on doing the same old thing, then maybe this idea is not for you. I, for one, am not going to compromise my artistic integrity. And I'll tell you something else, this is the show and we're not going to change it. (To Jerry) Right?
Oh, you haven't heard, she's going to live with her grandparents in Redding Pennsylvania.
Nah, I have asthma. (Robin's kid grabs George's leg from under the table, and George struggles.)
Hey, I brought you some cigarettes. You buy yourself something nice.
Listen uh, David, I, I, I want to apologize about that comment
Oh yeah, real cool. You're a cool guy.
I need higher. This has paba in it, I need paba-free.
Yeah. Actually it was in gym class. I was trying to climb the ropes and Jerry was spotting me. I kept slipping and burning my thighs and then finally I slipped and fell on Jerry's head. We've been close ever since.
See, look at this. (wearing a very tight shirt) Rachel, my T-shirt shrunk. It used to be much bigger, and now it shrunk. You see, that's what water does. It shrinks things.
Uh, nothing, lets get going. Come on. (laughs) hu hu.
Miss Rhode Island? When are you seeing her?
Tuesday? I can't do it Tuesday. Steinbrenner needs me to run---
Alright. Listen, I gotta get some reading done. You mind if I do this here? I can't concentrate in my apartment.
What are you looking at me like that for?
Nothing It's not you. It's me. I have a fear of commitment. I don't know how to love.
(standing) All right, I'm gonna move my car, my meter's up. Can't park in this city.
Oh Jerry, that is so sweet of you but actually i already ate.
Damn you, laser guy! You had to grab it all with your lowbrow laser shtick! You're just a prop comic! Where's the craft?!
(Silently squinches his mouth and nods at Kramer)
(trying again with Glenda) I'm gonna count to three. If you don't give up the chair, the wig is coming off.
Hey, they can't go, "Hey! You look fabulous!"
I have to have my tonsils taken out.
Of course you do, but youre imagining a guy you like, not a guy who goes, Oh no, I dont drink coffee late at night. If I call her now, shes gonna think Im too needy. Women dont wanna see need. They want a take-charge guy  a colonel, a Kaiser, a tsar.
Oh, yeah. You wish you had this coat.
Yeah, and, ... Why won't this go down?
OH!!!! What are you, crazy?! Are you, crazy?!
Hey! Great plane! Thanks a lot. Piece of junk. You know you almost got us killed!
It's all worked out. Nina and I will have dinner Thursday at the restaurant where Babs works.
All right, all right, one more time, one more time! What was the exact phrasing of the request?
It's like puberty that never stops. Ear puberty, nose puberty, knuckle puberty, you gotta be vigilent. Let me ask you this Do you know where Walker Street is downtown? I've got a league meeting there.
What, you think I'm going to repeat the whole thing now?
Dont insult me, my friend. Remember who youre talking to. No ones a bigger idiot than me.
That's my whole afternoon! I was going to look for sneakers.
Y'know, now you gotta ask her her name. It's so embarrassing.
Do you think it would be better if I did?
The little extra moan you threw in there. Laying it on a bit thick, don't you think?
Yeah, and I - I heard you got on their good side. Now, what'd you do?
No, I don't know. Maybe you haven't. You know, not everybody's seen a massage table.
(PULLING OUT ESTIMATE OUT OF HIS POCKET) Well, profit. I think you'll see from the estimate that I'm not really profiting that much. They might be a little high, but..
So, uh, gentlemen, do we have a deal?
Oh! That's good judgment. That's a pile of judgment there. Sure.
(animated) What're you talking about?! She's very concerned! She said she was gonna get it back.
No, that's my only suit. It cost me 350 dollars. I got it at Moe Ginsburg.
Wait a minute, wait, it's not that stupid.
Well, don't they make a counter offer? How can they just cancel the whole deal like that? What kind of a maniac is this guy? I mean he just, he says no, and that's it?
Well what if I told you I'm thinking of moving here?
Excuse me. Can I talk to you for a second there, Watkins?
Yeah. Got to invite The Drake. Listen hem...there's something that's been on my mind and we haven't really talked about it..I t's kind of important to me.
And, um, it was quite good. In fact, you even incorporated me into the show. I'm not actually a performer. Although, my parents felt I had talent..
Oh, no no no. I pay what I say.
I'm gay! I'm a gay man! I'm very, very gay.
What a world that would be, if you just could ask a woman what shes thinkin.
Hey, Lloyd. (Shakes hands with Lloyd) How's it going? (chuckles)
Oh no, you're not going out on a high note with me Mr. Kruger!
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's in the vault. I'm putting it in the vault.
Yes. Very nice to have had her to mention... (starting to leave)
Hes a cube. Anyway, he got married six months ago. He told me ever since hes been wearing a wedding band, women have been coming on to him everywhere he goes.
(Laughs as they leave) It's working already! (Both exit)
So you don't think she really has a boyfriend?
Oh no no no no - we have to be in California next week. We're starting a TV show.
(Munching on a hamburger) This Arbys is good.
There was something so reassuring about that cozy little space.
Ha ha. Everything's timed out to perfection, Jerry. Slippery Pete's got the Frogger running on battery power, the truck will be there any minute, and Kramer's taped out the loading zone.
All right Bubble Boy. Let's just play... Who invaded Spain in the 8th century?
Thank you very much. (Peggy leaves the menus and walks away) So guess what I got do tomorrow?
I figured you'd cruise. At least through the Spring.
It's OK. It's fine. She'll do it. I'm sure she'll still do it.
Oh my god he's not kidding. (exhale gasp)
...and, and maybe shell see me when she gets there, does this woman intend to spend time with me?
There's a bag of Pepperidge Farm cookies up there.
A guy leaves a puddle of sweat, that's a signal?
C'mon, c'mon...(stands up and physically rolls Betsy to the left side of the couch.) See, now, is that so bad?
(checking his watch) Hey, let's get the check, she's taking the bandages off at four o'clock.
(coyly, he looks down and runs his finger along the top of the chair back in front of him) Do you, uh ... do you know what Im ... thinking about now?
Wait a minute, she did a skin cancer screening at Peterman?
Ah, great. All right, with the wine I'm in over twenty dollars now.
I don't even know her sister but believe me, if she's getting traffic tickets, she's not that good-looking! Woah
What's the difference? The money is not important.
No, you haven't. Well, maybe you have. What do I know.
Eh, they're trying to pick out a new couch - you don't want to know. (Remembering the watching Van Buren Boys) Give me your wallet, or I'll spill your guts right here on the street!
Well so what's the problem, you just put some newspaper down.
Jon Voight! Are you kiddin' me? Did you talk to him?
La-la Land. I got the window seat, right?
Well, I'm doing it, Jerry. I'm buying the Frogger machine. Now the torch will burn forever.
You told her? How could you tell her? I told you not to say anything.
Well, you really did it to me this time, Seinfeld. . . . What the hell happened here?
Yes, sure, surely was. Yeah, I'll remember that day. Well I'll never forget it because that was the day that I uh, lost my virginity to Miss. Stafford, the uh, voluptuous home room teacher.
Kramer, I, I, I, uh, I need to talk to Jerry privately.
(sarcasm) Hu-hu, like I don't know that? (excitement) My Cousin Vinnie, I love that! I, George Costanza, could be on a date with an Oscar winner! An Oscar winner, Jerry! You know what that's like? It's like if fifty years ago, someone fixed me up with Katherine Hepburn? Same thing!
You know, uh, she has no female friends! You know that, don't cha? Something strange about a woman whos friends are all men.
Well, if she keeps horsing around with that tractor--
Well, you could move in with my parents. (chuckles)
You know, Louise. I think you'll find this amusing. In early Euclidean geometry--
Well, let's just say it wouldn't exist without me. (Notices another person in the library dressed the same as Celia.) So you two uh, shop at the same store, (hu)?
Yeah, the oceans really are getting very sudsy.
Well, I think Poppie's got some problems. There's a whole other thing going on with Poppie. So how did you leave it?
. We should be having dinner with our sons when we're sixty.
So I finally stop and say, "Tatiana, I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but I think it would be best if I left".
(he drops a paper airplane he was holding) Mr. Wilhelm!
(looking over her resume) Well Miss Coggins you're ah, obviously qualified for the job. You've all the necessary skills and experience. But you're extremely attractive. you're gorgeous. Im looking at you, I can't even remember my name. So ah, Im afraid this is not going to work out (he crumples her resume into a ball) Thanks for coming in.
That's what she says. I say, listen. It was an old cat. It died of natural causes. So get this, now she tells me that I gotta buy her a brand new cat. I say listen, honey. First of all, it was a pretty old cat. I'm not gonna buy you a brand new cat to replace an old dying cat. And second of all, I go out to the garbage, I find you a new cat in fifteen seconds. I say, you show me an autopsy report that says this cat died of starvation, I spring for a new cat. So she says something to me, like, uh, I dunno, get the hell out of here, and she breaks up with me. Now don't you think that would be a great case on L.A. Law?
My name is not mentioned in this blurb...
Unbelievable, I'm never gonna get out of here. The guy goes to pee, he never comes back. It's like a science fiction story.
Hi. I'm ah, I'm here to see a Mr. Art Vandelay..
Hey, a "hit" is a totally different story.
Why don't we talk about it another time.
What are we gonna do? How are we gonna get out of here?
(leaving) Alright that's it for me. Good night everybody.
I think Im getting tired of it. I mean is that all it does? Hello? La-la-la?
Jerry, figure this out. I'm in the coffee shop, and this beautiful girl I could never even talk to, mistakes me for her boyfriend.
[realizing the only way out is to show the stub] I've got the stub.
They don't need any water, so you don't have to keep taking them to the bathroom.
(George takes out the suit from the other rack) Well, look at this. (innocently) This doesn't belong here! Someone has made a terrible mistake.
You are aware that Pensky is interested in me.
What is it about sex that just disrupts everything? Is it the touching? Is it the nudity?
(Hands Antonio a card) Here's my card. I'm in real estate, so, if you're ever looking for something bigger, something nicer.. (Antonio is staring at him, angered) ..maybe not right now. Anyway.. (Extends his hand for a handshake. Antonio doesn't move)
Because I kissed her in the meeting. Russell found out, he fired her over the phone. Finally, my stupidity pays off!
You know that coat was Gore-Tex. Its worth a hell of a lot more than that, cheap Chardonnay.
Well... we could dance around it a little first.
Oh my God, I forgot to tell you. I got a letter today from the State Controller's Office. Y'know when I was going to public school back in Brooklyn, every week I used to put fifty cents in the Lincoln Savings Bank.
You know, I used to love Paris. My uh, dead Fiance, Susan.. (opening wallet) In fact I. think I, I may have a picture of her..
Did you happen to notice that Julie handed the big salad to Elaine?
Oh, sports are so pedestrian. I've prepared some science experiments that will illuminate the mind and dazzle the eye.
I'll tell you what that is - that's a violation of club rules. Now I got him! And you're my witness!
(Sarcastic) Yeah, performance artist. She's a real performer. A real trooper.
(Reading the card from Whatley) "This holiday season a donation has been made in your name to the Children's Alliance."?
No, no, Kurt - wrong attitude. You should be happy now.
A signal, right, um, okay, uh, okay, the signal is, Ill call out tippy-toe!
Oh, sure, my Black Hawks jacket. I love my Black Hawks jacket.
Oh, I think so, and I can prove it. You see, I was doodling on the bill and uh, so if you have a twenty in there with big lips on it... well, (smiles) that's mine. Would you mind opening up the register?
Every summer you guys went to camp together. I was jealous. Felt like he was the summer me.
I'll call a plumber right now! (Goes for the phone.)
It wasn't down in, it was sort of on top.
(Depressed) Well,.. the Andrea Doria.. that was quite a fire. (Moves to the door, leaving)
You know you buy a big salad for somebody it would be nice if they knew it.
He's got a gun! He's got a gun! Get out of the way! (Tries to flee the bar in a mad panic. The audience in the club also goes nuts and heads for the exits. Jerry stands onstage, perplexed.)
Ehh. (nostalgic) Remember that summer at Dairy Queen where I cooled my feet in the soft-serve machine?
That woman was unequivocally the worst date of my life.
Oy uy uy.. (Antonio points to the sink) We really should get going.
Have you seen Jerry? (sitting beside Elaine) I told him two o'clock.
tsh (snorts) Ah, yeah, we've - we've talked . . . I believe I can speak for the both of us on this.
Was she uh, was she a big, uh woman?
If there's any doubt, I do a leave-behind. Keys, gloves, scarf -- I go back to her place to pick it up...(pop sound) date number two.
I gotta prep. I need a couple of anecdotes, a few you-were-right-abouts. It's a whole procedure. Wasn't Fragile Frankie the one that used to run into the woods every time he got upset?
Oh yeeah.. well , Big smoker... I (coughs some more) gave it up for a while but it was too tough. Y' know.....I got no will power.
What are you up to now, uh, Step Nine?
Is there ever a good time to have your parents stay with you?
What did you put the Pez dispenser on her leg for in the first place?
If I could talk to the guy for just a sec...
No! I'm not gonna do that! That's one step away from personal ads! And prostitutes! No! No, I am not going down that road! What does she look like?
I just don't think it's such a great idea for you to sit here.
What about the dolphins? You could swim with the dolphins down there.
Ah, get outta here. The vomiting is much funnier.
I've tried. We don't have it. But maybe the two of us, working together at full capacity, could do the job of one normal man.
Of course! Alright, maybe I'll say something to Buck.
Anyway there was all this tension. I asked her if she wanted to go out to dinner and she said "no, maybe we could get together for lunch." You know what that means.
What am I going to do now? I can't live without Susan. I gotta get her back. How? How, am I gonna get her back?
Don't go shouting we got a hundred dollar bill. People will be jumping out of windows on top of us.
Come on, wanna give me a hand with the computers?
Those were her exact words, I like George.
No, no, no, see you're not really listening.
I can't go in there. Im too uncomfortable.
Because if I watch it at my apartment I feel like I'm not doing anything. If I watch it here, I'm out of the house; I'm doing something.
All he has to do now is count his blessings, say a prayer, and he's done. Do you believe this?
Okay, I guess I'll see you down there.
Elaine, get off the speaker! (Elaine picks up phone)
Well, why would the guy make up something like that? Of all the names he could pick, why settle on Jon Voight?
I don't know why Rachel had to drive back with Michael and Carol.
(to the cashier) Excuse me, I gave you a twenty dollar bill and you only actually gave me change for a ten.
Oh, what time is it? Eight thirty? I'll tell you what's on. You got Major Dad, Blossom, very funny programme...
Yeah, I think, you know, she was, like, crying, and he was consoling her, and then, she, uh, just got into his car, and they just drove away.
Wait a minute, that is my apartment. I earned it with 34 years of misery!
(excited, pushing Jerry forward) All right, let's go, let's go, let's go, come on.
Jerry, I'm trapped under my desk. Steinbrenner is in the room. You got to help[ me.
Well, I'm also an architect. Is that pastrami?
I have mourned for three long months! Summer months, too! Anybody could grieve in January! It's time for George to start being George again.
Just a suggestion. (chuckles and walks back to the yelling guy)
(Stern) No, ma, I'm not gonna see a psychiatrist. N- I don't care if you do pay for it! No! Discussion over. Yeah, alright, I'll see you later. Yes, of course I'm gonna come by. Alright. (Hangs up, slamming it down on the coffee table. He sits down next to Jerry) My mother wants me to see a psychiatrist now. Why?! Because she caught me? (Scoffs, shaking his head) You know, if everyone who did that had to go see a psychiatrist.. (Laughing, he snorts)
Oh, nothin' much. I went over to jerry's, uh, talked to Jerry.
Hey, yeah. My parents want to come too, is that ok?
I'm sorry I'm sorry, here's the test. Thanks again for doing this - hhe.
All right, I think they have fleas there. So what...
How come youre not doin the second show tomorrow?
No, I can't. What if I meet a woman? I'd always be worried about that first moment where I'd take it off and see that look of disappointment on her face.
It's not working, Jerry. It's just not working. (sits down next to Elaine)
Oh. Oh. Yeah, sure. Here. Uh, sit down. Uh, uh, cheese, there? (he grabs a suit jacket from the desk chair and puts it on)
What are you worried about, you know it.
Why do I get pesto? Why do I think I'll like it? I keep trying to like it, like I have to like it.
So, anyway, what's uh, what's the status with, uh...
Ya it used to be right in the middle of single Jeopardy and now they do it right after single Jeopardy.
Let's see, How I'm very good at going in reverse in my car, why isn't Postum a more popular drink,
I don't think I've ever spoken to her.
No, not nice. She's stickin' it to me.
Now, fellas, fellas.. easy. You wouldn't want to beat up on one of your own.
So, she fell, and then she started screaming, "My back! My back!" So, I picked her up and took her to the hospital.
Why does she want you to be mad?
Hey, hey, hey! It's not Lupe's fault, you shouldn't have left it out.
Just do it like a Band-Aid. One motion. Right off! (beat) She is sexy though. Dont you think?
Shhhhh. If you want to get in, theres very little time. (calling to the waitress) Sweetheart.. (Waitress approaches and tears off a check. George stops her.) No, no, no. That ought to cover it. (He hands her some money; she turns to leave; George stops her.) Just a second. Just a... let me jus-peek... (He looks at the check, then takes some money out of her hand. George urges Jerry and Elaine to eat.) Come on, come on, come on...
I'm telling you, skip the Drake's wedding, go to the game.
I have nothing to say to anybody. I'm so uninteresting. I think I'm out of conversation.
Great. (They both stand.) Oh, by the way, did you get a chance to read the script?
(Outraged) "That's all"?! That's everything! I don't know what all the rest of it is for anyway!
You see, my friend here, his aunt passed away last night.
He said he didn't care. Oh, God I love that place. Hey, have you seen other dermatologist?
She must have seen me eating it on TV.
Oh they'll get out of the way. You really smell banana?
Whatever. (George looks to the table) Hey new tape recorder?
Yes, of course I'm taking Allison. This woman is genetically engineered to go to a ball. Tall, blonde, lithe--
The door? Why would I go out the door? The window's right here.
Probably because this whole Universe is against me!
I banged it on the desk in the doctor's office. An (worriedly rubbing his arm) aaaa . . .
(TALKING IN PASSENGER WINDOW) I didn't mean anything by it. I don't even know L. Ron Hubbard! I didn't know you were...
Oh, she didn't think it was funny. What is she, Rowan & Martin? We're supposed to meet with NBC tomorrow! She completely shattered my confidence. And I'm paying for this, she's my employee!
Yeah, and a whole new me. I'm up two inches in these babies!
(looking uncomfortable) Um... yeah! Sure, sure I'm interested.
Okay. Hey, you know what, maybe I should give it to my therapist to read. She's smart, I trust her.
This woman left this really sexy message on Jerry's tape recorder......
I just remembered, th-th-there's this Chinese restaurant out near Yankee Stadium, that puts flyers on all the cars.
My name is George. I'm unemployed and I live with my parents.
Yes I'd like to speak to Marisa Tomei, please? Marisa, Hi it's George Costanza.. I'm the short, funny, quirky bald man you met a little while ago, heh! yeah I was just calling 'cos I wanted you to know that I'm not engaged anymore......well huh, She died....Toxic glue from the wedding invitations.....well we were expecting about two hundred people. Yeah... Anyway.. hum I got the funeral tomorrow but huh.. my weekend is pretty wide open and I was wondering... (dial tone interrupts George)..... Hello...Hello..
What do you think? The brought it over in pieces and screwed it together like a coffee table?
(Changing subject) Hey, I htink I may have found someone for the scholarship.
We've just been through this! You don't remember? We just had this exact same conversation a minute ago!
Men have been popping into my sexual fantasies. All of a sudden I'll be, in the middle.
Oh, please. (to the teller) Can you change this into bills?
What's the difference, you're a woman. They're supposed to be touching you.
You know, I cant believe youre bringin in an extra bed for woman that wants to sleep with you. Why dont you bring in an extra guy too?
A few days go by and a call is placed at a time when Sandy is known to be busy at work. Once the initial awkwardness is relieved with a little playful humor, which she [Laura] of course cannot resist, an invitation to a friendly dinner is proffered.
I'm the opposite of every guy you've ever met.
(trying to laugh it off) Right. C'mon! I'm having an affair with Elaine?! If I was having an affair with Elaine, I wouldn't tell you I'm going to see Elaine. I would make up some other person to tell you I was gonna go see, and then I would go see Ela..Elaine.
I still don't see why I can't ask her about my arm.
What, you're gonna take her word over mine? I'm your best friend!
You know. (All three give him blank stares) I was alone..
Well, why don't *you* go, and I could save the seats. You said you didn't like saving anyway.
Who doesn't like cashmere? Find me one person in the world that doesn't like cashmere. It's too expensive.
You can't leave! This is an ambulance! This is an emergency!
Hi, it's me. It's Georgie Boy. What's going on?
What does she need? Maybe there's something that she needs.
Danielle. Where's Neil? (indicating the bed) Is this him?
Its a great thrill to meet you, Sir.
I dont know, 120, 130Then they sent some guys to sandblast for 6 hours. Tomorrow they are putting in asbestos.
Uh huh. Uh huh! I think you spoke to your little friend Rachel, that's what I think.
That's where the Seinfeld's are moving. They got a great deal. Yep. You know what they got in Florida? Jai-Alai! You bet on the games, you clean up.
Cold? How are you going to do that? You're not one of those guys.
(to himself) You can't tell much from those pictures.
Well, a lot of people keep popcorn in the house.
Alright, stop it Kramer, you're freakin' me out. (The waitress comes over.)
You see that woman on the horse? (points)
Oh, well, he was probably just getting anxious to start his vacation.
I'm just asking, all they have to do is say no.
Jerry, for all I know this guy went out of his way to not invite you. How am I gonna feel if I show up with an uninvited, unwelcome intruder?
It's beautiful. She makes all the plans. I'm not from around here so it's okay if I'm stupid, and she knows I'm only in town visiting so there's no messy breakup
George, don't make me get tough with you. Whu, hu, hu, hu huuuu (raises arms) Who says that? She is really cool. What do you think? You think she likes me?
I never should have brought her up there. Should have known better. Should have seen it coming. I didn't see it coming.
Oh, man, it's spinach! I've been walking around like this all afternoon.
Oh I think I'd go for the back.
All right, look--wait--wait--Krama--wait, wait a minute, you are not. You are not goin' in. Ah-ahhh!
You ask me here to have lunch, tell me you slept with Elaine, and then say you're not in the mood for details. Now you listen to me. I want details and I want them right now. I don't have a job, I have no place to go. You're not in the mood? Well you get in the mood!
You tellin' 'em about the butler story? Is that beautiful or what? Hey, sorry I'm late. (Looks at Rita) Russell?
I need like a bucket of water! I got a car overheating, I got an alarm that won't go off, I'm pressing 'one', I'm pressing 'two', nothing! What do I do?! Help me! Help me!
Elaine, when a woman makes a Ball Entrance.. she twirls.
Uh, excuse me. (stopping them from rehearsing) Excuse me. (he walks to the guy's in charge of yelling "take #!") This--This is not right. May I? (the guy looks at George with a bothered face. George then walks up to Tom and takes him away from Jerry and Michael to talk to him in private)(to Tom) You see, you're going "They fooled *me* Jerry!" (George shakes his head with disapproval) You wanna hit 'fooled' more "They *fooled* me Jerry!". You see the difference?
Ho ho. This bizarre ?harrod? experiment must end!
Yeah. I think we really go something here.
(still pleased) She doesn't know that. We say that you do.
In this scene my co-star who's right over here ( goes over to George who is still on the phone) Follow meeeee... is George Costanza, he plays an airline pilot who's just returned from Rome and I'm about to show him how much I've missed him.
My whole life is ruined because of the (Mocking, bitter tone) "puffy shirt".
They'll make you a Big Salad. What do you think, they're the only one's that make a Big Salad?
You are gonna love this car. Even if you don't like Jon Voight.
I'm not crying. And I shouldn't have said that about your wife. Please accept my apologies.
(smiling) I'm on a winning ball club, Jerry. They probably wanna pick my brains.
No, I would have picked up on it. I can always tell when a woman likes me, they always somehow let you know. With me, they could torture me, I wouldn't tell them. If anything I'd try to make them think I don't like them, then they think, "Oh, look at this guy, he's not even looking at me, he must have something going for him."
I was, I had to leave. She lit some vanilla incenses. The smell drove me nuts, all I could think about was food, I had to get out of there. We need some pudding here! Pudding!
O.K., Danny, take a swing. (Tartabull swings the bat.) N-No! No! No! You're opening up your shoulder.
Huh-ho! Oh! You are too much, Mr. Kruger! Too much!
Sorry? Why sorry? What you got to be sorry about?
What if she becomes Miss America? You could be dating Miss America, Jerry!
You dont have to call that! Thats a rule!
My face! My face! Get me to the hospital!
Did I get him in trouble? Because of what I said?! I just told him what happened.. he didn't do it on purpose.. (Mangager and busboy are arguing. The busboy points in the direction of George) He pointed at me. Why did he point at me?!
It was fantastic, Jerry. We wound up talking all night.
I know, but don't say anything to anyone. He told me not to tell you.
Severance package...The Yankees are giving me three months full pay for doing nothing.
(To Estelle) Scissor. (She gets the scissors from the coffee table and hands them to George with the point facing him) Don't hand them to me with the point facing out!
Oh, well I didn't know you went into Queens Jerry.
Jerry, this whole Ellen situation.. has gone far enough.
Sure, well uh, you know I'll check in with you next week uh, I gotta run now because I got a full plate this afternoon. All right, really go to uh,.
He knows this guy, Wilkinson. He made a fortune in the stock market. Now hes got some new thing. You know, theres supposed to be a big merger. He wasnt even supposed to say anything. You guys should think about doing this too.
I spilled some Chardonnay. So, what did you get?
This hat just bottles in the heat, I -I don't even need a coat! It's unbelievable!
Oh, yeah. I read what you said to the papers yesterday. You weren't in on the planing. What planning? YOU THINK WE PLANED THIS? Uh?
What could I do? Did you see the mug on that kid?
Alright, just make sure he reserves the good chair for me. Wait, what are you gonna tell him about the clanking noise in the car?
I was just blowin' off a little steam. So what?
No, I don't know. How do I know the usual?
Speak now, or we are headed to the Hamptons. It's a two-hour drive. Once you get in that car, we are going all the way... to the Hamptons. All right, you wanna get nuts? Come on. Let's get nuts!
Hello! All right, we should be going. Come on...
Well, I do what I can. (Robin comes over.)
Alright, so I haven't put anything in it since sixth grade, I completely forgot about it. The State Controller's Office tracks me down. The interest has accumulated to 1,900 dollars. 1,900 dollars! They're sending me a cheque!
Oh, please don't tell me you love me again, Jerry, I can't handle it.
Thats why, you know, a shake is bad.
I got two tickets to see "Guys And Dolls".
We talked about his new batting stance, you know, I'm not crazy about it, but I said , 'Donny, go with it 'till it stops workin'.' Donny baseball. He's a helluva guy.
She's been locked up for two years. She's gonna want to make up for lost time. Dinners. Movies. (Rubs his forehead.) Talking...
You saw him. He was fiddling with the engine. God knows what he did there.
I would like to dip my bald head in oil and rub it all over your body. [No reaction] You don't understand! It's a miracle! You don't understand because you don't speak English!
I was in there for two minutes. He didnt do anything. Touch this, feel that  seventy-five bucks!
(from bathroom) How was Eric Roberts as the husband?
Is that so? Or could it be that you're just a *little* bit worried that you may have missed the boat?
(taking it out of his jacket pocket) yeah I got some sandwiches.. I got tuna.. and salmon salad Tony because I know you don't like peanut butter
I just remembered, I gotta be someplace. Yuh-hu-hur, that's enough. Pop. Pop, put down the wrench, Pop.
No, I fake limp on my right. This is a real limp because I sprained my ankle.
S-s-somebody double parked, we couldn't help it. It might have been Saddam Hussein, we're not really sure. He eh, had a British accent though.
Look, I have my system. First I look for the dream spot right in front of the door, then I slowly expand out in concentric circles.
What? No dibs! I need this statue. Cmon, give it!
You know what this has to do with?
Where are you gettin' a Wizard for fifty dollars?
Of course he is. There's got to be houses for rent in Tuscany. Do you know how big Tuscany is?
( mouth full) Hi, this is fantastic ( puts the pit in the a plate)D'you ever had a Macanaw peach?
What, are you crazy? It's a traumatic thing to be thrown up on.
So, that's it. All of my darkest fears, and... everything I'm capable of. That's me.
All right. That's enough for today. You're tired. Get some sleep. I'll see you first thing in the morning.
But it--eh.. It was here, I'm tellin' you, an' w--w--it was really here! The, there was, a, bar, and a, an' a dance floor..
(con't) All right, you know she's got that laugh. What did you say? It's like Elmer Fudd sitting on a juicer?
(Fed up with his parents) Actually, I think I'm pretty clear on it.
(as Jerry and Elaine continue to whine) Give it! Give it! (he finally gets the remote away from them) Pinheads.
Eh, listen Mr. Kruger, I got a message from Dr. Van Nostrand and he says it might be wise to you to see another doctor about that mole.
(singing) Master of the house/Doling out the charm/Ready with a handshake and an open palm/Tells a saucy talk/Loves to make a stir/Everyone appreciates a...
I thought you said he was gonna get a muffin.
It's right in the explosion scene. So if you could just...leave me a little window. You know, my, uh, my aunt had a thing removed with a laser. All right, I don't want to interrupt your meal, so...
Well, I gotta go back there and try again. Hi Sheila.
(gleeful) Hehee. W..we could be like the Gatsbys. Didn't they always like, you know, a bunch of people around, and they were all best friends?
All right. All right. Let's - let's go over that again.
Excuse me, uh, what are you doing in there?
I was moving it across the street, I looked up and I saw Woody Allen and I got all distracted.
Oh, *please*! Me? C'mon! That's *great*! Are you kidding? I think thats fan*tastic*! I've always encouraged experimentation! I'm the first guy in the pool! Who do you think you're talking to?
(Picking up the ketchup) What typical? Gimme typical. Gimme some typical.
What did they put on this tuna? Tastes like a dill, I think it's a dill.
No, no, not really. Ever since Susan passed on, I have good days and bad. (Turns the briefcase towards the woman on his left.) Some days, I'm haunted by one word - why. Why Susan? Why wasn't it me licking those invitations? Why am I still here? Well, I gotta run. (Gets up and leaves the meeting.)
Well, I like to stay in touch with the people.
I can't believe what's happening here. She hasn't taken her hands off me all night. She was always friendly around the office, but that was it.
What happens if the husband dies after the wife, who brings in the clothing in then?
I never heard him say anything really funny.
(to the woman) Boy, I have to get to a bathroom.
(upset) I *told* you the Drake was bad! I hate the Drake!
Wow. (he runs his fingers through his hair, and then brushes the resulting fallout off his jacket)
There was nothing else on. Oh, the left arm.. the left arm.
Elaine you don't understand. I had 103 temperature when I bought that sweater. I was so dizzy I was seeing red dots everywhere. I thought everything in the store had a red dot on it. I couldn't distinguish one red dot from another. I couldn't afford anything. I have nothing. I haven't worked for a really long time. (Jerry is standing right behind George. Jerry takes out a hankerchief and starts fake-crying in it.) I mean look, I have no clothes, look at what I'm wearing. It's just a little red dot.
(Embarrassed) That's all I could find. (A moment passes) Would you mind getting the door?
(seeing his parents being intimate) Oh, my god!
Its called Sendrax. Theyve got some new kind of technique for televising opera.
Im outta there. I did it! Its over.
Get up, get up, its her! Oh, the hell with this, Im scared to death, just walk away, its off, cancel everything, go!
I can't tell ya how much I appreciate this.
I was just wondering what it was you wanted for dessert.
Of course not. You don't care what I look like.
Mulva! (again pointing finger at Jerry -- Kramer watches the exchange back and forth)
She knew I didnt have a job, she knew I lived at home. Didnt seem to bother her. I think I could have married this woman.
You know what word Susan used last night? Hnuh. Vault! hu,
Really? You like it? I got it at a flea market today.
Oh my God. I must be crazy. What have I done?
Split it. Pretty good. Talk about game six?
Yeah, as a matter of fact, I did.
You know, Ive been thinking. I cannot envision any circumstances in which Ill ever have the opportunity to have sex again. Hows it gonna happen? I just dont see how it could occur.
Oh, uh, the cigars.. (Chuckles nervously) I'm, uh, suckin' 'em down. I'm puffing my brains out, yeah.
(The damage has been done. He is slightly angered at Jerry) May I ask, what do you read in the bathroom?
Hmm, what's he doin' in the city today?
So what? Somebody dropped an egg on my head as I went into my building last night.
Deeply in love. If you can't say anything bad about a relationship, you shouldn't say anything at all.
She can't take it. It's not hers, it's theirs. Once there's no theirs there's no hers, it should be ours.
Why, you think you can, beat me up?
What come on? Have you ever dated a woman that worked in your office?
He's a jerk. (nudges to his right but no one is there)
Dark and disturbed? His whole life revolves around Superman and cereal. I convinced him to act like that so that you would think I was funnier. That's how disturbed I am! If you want disturbed, that's disturbed. You can't find sickness like that anywhere, you think sickness like that grows on trees? Nobody is sicker than me, nobody. He's pretending, I'm the genuine article.
Yeah, what do you do when you run out of laundry?
(he thinks a little about it... and as he puts his hand on his knee and gets up) I'm sorry Karen. I know I care for you, but I just can't stand when someone doesn't like me. (he opens the door)
Shst, You should take the test for me.
You can't handle the truth! (he salutes) (imitating Jack Nicholson [a.k.a. Col. Nathan R. Jessep], from the 1992 movie A Few Good Men)
Yeah, two for the 715 of Novaj pravas (?). What you're wearing the green sweater?
What if he's waiting for me outside? He pointed at me! Did you see him point?!
And this is the first you're seeing of the coat?
Oh, yeah, sure, accident, right. She was aiming right at me like she was putting out a fire! Then, for the rest of the show, I'm sitting there with chocolate all over my shirt. Flies are landing on me. I'm boiling - I'm fantasizing all the things I'm gonna say when I see her. And later, finally, backstage when I talk to her, I'm a groveling worm. "What kind of chocolate was that? Do you throw any other foods?"
She knows that I have her clock. I know that she has my hat. I think she's getting ready to make an exchange.
I mean, big would even be ok, a little beyond big.
Yeah, well, she's trying to track you down.
That's the sign! The test; if a - if a man makes it move.
Well say were frightened and we have to go home.
How could it still smell after all that?
Svenjolly. (licking a little bit of peanut butter from his finger)
It's like you're livin' in the Playboy Mansion! Did she, uh, did she frolic?
Hey, Jerry, what was the name of the exterminator who fumigated your apartment when you had fleas?
Well, I was buttering myself up for a nice shave --
(on the answering machine) Jerry, it's George. Hey, hey are you all set for the weekend. This is going to be great. You're going to have a great time with Naomi.
No. I wouldnt even have to tell her. I could surprise her.
All right, all right, calm down, calm down. Whatever happened in the past is past.
I am not O'Brien! I am not O'Brien! I'm not O'Brien! Ask anyone! Jerry?! Jerry?!!
(outside, looking the guy trying the suit through the window, and thinking out loud) What's this? Can't I leave this place for a second? (goes in, take off his jacket, walks to the guy and talks to him with an european accent) Can I help you?
(taking out wallet) Well, let me. Heh. Let me just eh.. check an', make sure I have the right man--ha! Heh, heh, heh! Seems--oh! I, oh! (has conveniently dropped the photo into her view)
Sorry, we're a little late. We got so hung up in traffic.
Ohh, I have tremendous respect for people who work with feet. I mean, to dedicate yourself to the foot - you're toiling in virtual anonymity. I mean..
Anyway, again, I'm sorry about throwing you out of the car.
(from other room) Uh, tippy toe! Tippy toe! Lemon tree!
Well, you didn't hear it from me, but needless to say, if you go in there - stick with the consumee.
I, I couldnt wait. I was too anxious to see you.
There could be more than one O'Brien on a plane who ordered a limo.
Did you ever see her lose her temper. I was once late cause I bought a Panama hat -- she grabbed it by the brim, pulled it down so hard my head came right through the top of it.
(putting the car in reverse) Oh beautiful! Look at that, the dream space right in front of Jerry's building. Huh? Dreams can come true, what did I tell you?
Oh! Here you are. Ha ha...You, uh, you want to--
You think she could be an 'it'? Could she be an 'it'?
You know Elaine, I'd do it but I'm working that day.
Was that wrong? Should I have not done that? I tell you I gotta plead ignorance on this thing because if anyone had said anything to me at all when I first started here that that sort of thing was frouned upon, you know, cause I've worked in a lot of offices and I tell you peope do that all the time.
Daphne. I have to tell you something, this is very difficult...
Ah. You see, the man who was the butler, uh, had gotten into a car accident with Jerry, and because he didn't have any insurance, the judge decreed that the man become Jerry's butler.
(gleeful, to Estelle) You did?! That's Goood! That's very good! I'm very glad to hear that.
This is the life! Isn't it, huh, kid?
I think he's saying 'Son of Sam'! Oh, my God!
The woman she's "lesbianing" with? Susan told me she's *never* been with a guy.
Jerry, let's face it, I've always been handicapped. I'm just now getting the recognition for it. Name one thing I have that puts me in a position of advantage. Huh? There was a guy that worked at the Yankees-- no arms! He got more work done than I did, made more money, had a wife, a family, drove a better car than I did.
Well how do you even know its hers? Maybe it belonged to Carol. Did you see a name on the tube?
I can't eat with you leanin' over like this. Just look straight forward.
Wait a second, wait a second, what coming in, what woman is coming in?
Yeah, yeah. He went into the bedroom and started sobbing.
You see, It's right here. It's all white...
"Aahhrgh...it wouldn't take...... long pause, audience laughter) ten minutes from now, I'll be sweating all over again ,I can feel it. I'm a human heat pump!"
Yeah. The thing is, I, uh...I had this little zinger of my own I wanted to try.
You could pet them. They come right out of the water onto the sidewalks.
I don't know, she said she had to pick up a friend of hers at the airport. It cost me a hundred dollars this ticket.
Dogs, twists, a kind of fermented chicken drink.
What the hell is this? George, Elaine and I went to see Chunnel ... with Jerry. With Jerry, huh? With Jerry! Great. Great! (dials phone) Probably went to the 84th St. That's where I always go with Jerry.
Hey, speaking of which, I found a great way to separate the skin from the top of the pudding without leaving any around the edges; Exacto knife.
She stole twenty dollars from me. (getting angry) Yeah, I might've gotten it back, but Lloyd Braun interfered!
They're selling coffee, bran muffins.. you're surrounded by reading material. It's entrapment!
She's leaving me dirty messages on my answering machine.
Why did France give that to us anyway?
This is George Costanza, I'm calling for my test results. Negative? Oh, my God. WHY! WHY! WHY? What? What? Negative is good? Oh, yes of course! How stupid of me. Thank you. Thank you very much. (he hangs up)
I know. This was the only woman I never lied to. Well thats not entirely true.
Kramer! You can't go! Who's gonna do the feats of strength?
Wow! I didn't try that 'til I was 23.
(starts to try to get passed Jerry and Elaine) Alright get out of my way. (Jerry and Elaine push him back, George very annoyed) Alright don't make me get physical here!
Just need to uh, to dig 'em up.
Every time we go out to eat the minute we we're done eating she's runnin to the bathroom.
I suppose he's an attractive man, I ,
What kind of a therapist are you? I'm telling I'm scared that something terrible is gonna happen to me, right away you start looking for tumors?
The guy that stole my glasses. This time I got 'em! (George follows the man onto the street, dragging the blind man with him) Would you pick it up a little?
I didn't even know it was a job.
I need food, Jerry. I feel faint, I'm getting light headed.
(Putting his hands up) Alright, alright, hold on! (Jerry has George's full attention) Time out! Woah, woah! (Scooting in, giddy) What did she say?
Yeah, yeah. You really cashed in on that favor pretty quick.
Sure, sure, sure, sure. (patting Jerry on the shoulders) How about these seats? Are these fantastic, huh? Huh? I feel like Lincoln.
Gone. (Moves over to a chair in the living room. Kramer takes the carton of food to the table, and begins eating) The tenant association made me give it to this guy because he was an Andrea Doria survivor..
Why don't they have salsa on the table?
You don't understand. He's got this big party coming up. He's been looking forward to this for months. This is gonna destroy the whole thing.
They refuse to put cucumber in the salad. I need cucumber.
I've done the march in. Best feeling in the world.
Yeah, yeah. I've heard that. Meanwhile I'm here with you in a parking garage, what am I supposed to do?
So, what's happening with the TV show? You come up with anything?
I know. It's Mickey Mantle's number. So not only is it an all around beautiful name, it is also a living tribute.
(tasting the wine) Excellent. Like I really know what I'm talking about.
I don't understand things were going so great. What happened? Something must have happened.
Excuse me. Am I talking to you, Pinhead? Am I?!
Listen, you go over to the ticket counter, I'm going to go stop in the gift shop and pick up a copy of Time magazine. There's supposed to ba blurb about Jerry in it and I think he mentioned my name!
That should be 14, let me just...(corrects it with a pen.)
Would it kill him to check up on us? No - drops off the meals and that's it. I realize we're prisoners, but we're still entitled to catsup.
Lunch is fine at the beginning then you move on to dinner. you don't move back to lunch. It's like being demoted. I'll never do another crossword puzzle with her again. I know it.
Ha, Yeah right, hang on, Ill ah, Ill get her for you. he, he, he, he. Seriously, what's up?
They all have swirling chocolate in the commercial!
You only think that because you know me.
What kind of a sick, demented person wants another person's glasses?
Oh I was not. The BUBBLE BOY was tried to kill me.
Yeah, yeah. You must have squirted a piece of pulp in it too.
That's no tragedy! How many people do you lose on a normal cruse? 30? 40?! Kramer, can I take a look at that book? (Starts walking tward the door. Kramer grabs his food, and follows)
It's worth a shot. (Goes to the door.)
What about the skin? I need a good cheek, I like a good cheek.
Wait a minute. I must have been winking down at the office. That's why Mr. Wilhelm was acting so mysteriouso.
Yeah. Hey, let ask you something. Is it just me, or - or do you find it unbearable to be around Jerry and that girl?
(pointedly) She could do a lot worse than Mr Peanut, my friend.
I don't know. He can be so weird sometimes.
See? This looks right to you, doesn't it?
Yeah, I do that too. I feel guilty about getting the pleasure. I feel like I don't deserve it so I talk. It stops me from enjoying it. There's nothing to eat in here.
Oh, no, not just me, the whole organization. Especially Mr. Morgan.
So they're flying the tiny instruments in from El Paso.
Well, we just blew 240 bucks on a wheelchair.
All right, but we're not buyin' it at Bloomingdale's. I will buy it, you pay me back later. I'll sniff out a deal. I have a sixth sense.
Do me a favor would you? Would you change lanes? Would you get outta this lane. You gotta get out of this lane. This lane stinks. They're all double parked here Please get outta this lane. I'm beggin you please please.
Oh, no. No no no no no. Id have to advise against that. What, do you know this woman a month? Lets see, youre going to be with her seventy-two hours. Thats a dating decathlon.
(glances upwards) Yeah. Uhm, why did she die so young?
(shouting) How d'you not like Soda?! It's bubbly, it's refreshing!
No, he said there was nothing he could do, and next time I should probably break the Prozacs in half.
(angrily)"WHY WEREN'T YOU MORE CAREFUL WITH YOUR DROOL!"
Why? Did she say something to you about why she broke up with me?
Ah. You know, there's gotta be an easier way to open ketchups. They should make it in a tube.
We gotta get something. I don't want to go to that meeting on an empty stomach. Let's get some Chinese. You wanna order it?
I'd like to sleep with a LOT of other women.
Well, I can see that. What do you have to do that for? Who cares about your pants size?
Well, I gotta do somethin'. (Walks over to bathroom. Kramer enters)
(embarrassed/self-conscious about his gut) Do I? Thanks.. You too..
Remember that New Year's party he threw a few years ago? He had that very drafty apartment, you know, I think on Ninth Avenue.
We haven't heard his notes yet, we don't know how he feels about our work. (Russell throws up yet again.)
Neeson? How are you comparing Liam Neeson with Jon Voight? Jerry, we're talking about Joe Buck. If you can play Joe Buck, Oskar Schindler's a cake walk. (Opens the car door for Jerry, Jerry's about to get in.)
Oh, you spoiled, spoiled man. Do you now how much mental energy I expend just trying to picture women naked?
What do I do? Well actually, I'm a writer. In fact, I'm writing a comedy pilot for NBC right now.
So he... had his hands and, uh, he was uh
Well what's in this giant box out in the hall?
(To Susan) I told you it looked like her..
Well it's not up my alley! It's one thing if I make it up. I know what I'm doin, I know my alleys! You got me in the Galapagos Islands livin' with the turtles, I don't know where the hell I am.
Oh, I think that's fantastic. Good for you. Nice. That's very nice.
There's nothing I can even impart to you, that's the sad thing. It's so inborn, I can't pass it on. (begins backing into the space) Look at this guy. Are you crazy, what are you doing?! Hey! Hey, you're stealing my space!
Aren't those the guys that always go crazy and come back with a gun and shoot everybody?
No. He was fine with it. Check that out.
I like Christian rock. It's very positive. It's not like those real musicians who think they're so cool and hip.
So, we watching the movie, or are we still talking? (Joe's wife shakes her head and goes into the other room. George gestures to Remy to move.) Okay, c'mon. Let's go.
Nah. It's all right. Great! She had a good time.
Oh yeah, but that has nothing to do with it.
(Nervous) Wh-what are you talking about? That - that's rediculous.
You don't need the cufflinks! You have the same name! (no reaction) 'Jerry'! (heads for door, grabbing his coat)
You should see what my father used to go through before he bought a car. He'd go from state to state. He was away for weeks at a time. It was like he was running for President and he was going through the primaries. We'd get phone calls from motels in New Hampshire.
I'm out! Fantastic apartment right across from mine, huh. I can't wait for you to see it.
(singing) Master of the House/Quick to catch your eye/Never wants a passerby to pass him by...
Alright, so that's one tuck and one no-tuck.
Yeah, sure. (big smile) Then my father will have no place to sleep. (snaps fingers) He's gotta move out.
Brother Costanza will be taking the vow of silence.
[to himself] Oh, my God! It's Susan! What do I do?
See now that bothers me even more than dying bothers me, cause it's people like you who live to be a hundred and twenty because you're not bothered by it. How could it not bother you?
I love these people, you can't ask 'em questions. (getting excited) They're so mentally gifted that we mustn't disturb the delicate genius unless it's in the confines of an office. (worked up) When huge sums of money are involved, then the delicate genius can be disturbed!
Where's the luck? There's no luck. 1,900 dollars down the drain.
She hasn't seen the article! When she sees it, she's gonna think-- *I'm out baby*!! I'm out!!!!!
All right, All right, keep your towel on.
Whew! Boy, it's cold outside, huh? Oh, these New York winters, huh. Bitter cold, bitter.
Get out of here. I didn't see any cameras there.
If you go now, I know what's gonna happen. We'll find the car, Jerry will show up, and then we'll never find you.
It's about the show. It... No, it was...
I think you absolutely have to say something to this guy. Confront him.
(resolved) Why not. (determined) If she can't find me, she can't break up with me. And, if we're still goin' out, she has to gooo to the ballll.
He just walked away! And once again I'm standing here like a little man. Well not this time! (George leaves the store and follows the dog owner) You! Dog man!
Summer of '89 I'm at the beach. This family sits up next to me. I go in to the surfs and when I come from out, my clothes, my towel, my umbrella, they're all gone. I am furious, I start screaming to these kids demanding my stuff back and finally I lose it; I grab their boom box and I chuck it in to the ocean.
You met her at the supermarket? How did you do that?
Excuse me, are you gonna be very long?
All right, I gotta get going. My parents are expecting me.
(Whispering to Jerry) What time is our flight back? I got to go to the bathroom.
Alright I happen to know what they did last night, they had dinner with Kramer.
Yes, flowers. I will get her flowers, I will go to the florist!
(to the guy next to him) This guy stinks. (speaking of Michael)
Listen, you're lucking I'm not asking for a whole refund. (trying to speak quietly) You gave me ladies' frames!
Well how could you just play your message in front of anybody?
All right, all right ( Goes to the bathroom)
I got it. You wanna get her something nice? How 'bout a music box?
You don't listen when people talk to you anymore!
I don't know, honey. What do you want to get? [in babying voice] I want you to get anything you want...'cause I love you so much. I want you to be happy. Okay, sweetie?
(enthusiastic) Yeah. You get a couch. I get rid of my father. It couldn't be more perfect!
Uh, it was dangling! There were only two left in the machine! He mustve bought one, and gotten both.
Shes an... etymologist. You know, bees, flies, gnats. W-What about you?
What are you doing? You're making more than I am. A secretary cannot make more than her boss.
No, I'm fine. I'm good. I'm very good.
I left it at Heather's. Are these alive? (pounding on glass display)
I went to the beach. (Jerry and Elaine exchange looks)
Well you know in college they used to call me the little bulldog.
I, I couldn't help but notice that uh you don't have a chair.
You're a very handsome man, by the way.
No, no, no... Just a *tiny* bit... It's not even *frontal* nudity. It's... *sidal* nudity...
Well I don't want to get into a big dispute about the pants.
So, they go off for the ride, by the time they come back the bread is there.
All right. You understand now? It's not that complicated.
Yeah. Cotton breathes, you see, it's much softer. Imagine playing games and your team is five degrees cooler than the other team. Don't you think that would be an advantage? They're cooler, they're more comfortable...they're happier - they're gonna play better.
That's like using a wheelchair for the fun of it!
Well at least you and I are talking about how there's nothing to talk about.
Yes, yes, I definitely waited. But let me say this Once he passes on that option, that 'God bless you' is up for grabs.
Yeah, yeah, like it's just part of the conversation. Oh my boyfriend really likes watches. He's a real watch freak. We-e-ell that's fabulous. (snaps fingers in the air a couple of times)
All right, Puddy, listen, and listen good I need to know the name of that mechanic that walks around here. Big guy, a liar. Short name. Sam? Moe? Sol?!
I-I'm sure if you weren't satisfied you would probably say something wouldn't you?
(Muttering to himself as he walks to the bedroom) More stuff..
I still don't see why you wouldn't eat me. I'm your best friend.
I go in to use his private bathroom, everybody uses it, and then I get a memo - a memo - telling me to use the men's room in the hall. Well, (laughing) I mean we share it with Pace Electronics. It's disgusting!
I don't like when a woman says, 'Make love to me', it's intimidating. The last time a woman said that to me, I wound up apologizing to her.
You see this is the thing. . . . (crying) I just feel . . . mumble, cry, mumble, . . . I'm scared. You and I together, (cry)
Great! I ate the entire platter! Had to call in sick today.
He knows I'm waiting. He sees me. He just doesn't wanna look.
Once, to a dog. He licked himself and left the room.
Slippery Pete, Kramer tells me you are one hell of a rogue electrician. And shlomo, you're the best truck driver.
Yeah, hold on. I'm, uh, I'm just trying to get a reading on my dashboard compass. Where are my parents?
You've got 'shiksappeal'. Jewish men love the idea of meeting a woman that's not like their mother.
(In a really strange way) Good, good, do that.
(dismayed) I didn't even know you wanted to get serious!
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm terribly sorry.. (Bends down, and starts picking up her things)
It it's huge. It's probably like North Dakota.
My censor quit two years ago. He checked into a clinic. Emotionally exhausted.
It's like some pod landed from another planet and took your body. Don't fall asleep Elaine.
He-he was uh touching and rubbing. (nervous laugh)
I'm a man. Jerry, I'm a man. And do you know why? It's because of that talk we had. You were my inspiration. Do you believe it? You. That lunch was the defining moment of my life.
Kramer, Kramer's not here...I knew it. I knew it! I knew this would happen. (SCREAMING) Kramer! Kramer!
Grateful? How can you be grateful when you're *so* close to the end? When you know that any second-- Poof! Bamm-O! It can all be over. I mean you're not stupid, you can read the handwriting on the wall. It's a matter of simple arithmetic, for Gods sake...
Well, I'm the boyfriend. Otherwise, what's the point of being the boyfriend? This is where you have to be when you're the boyfriend.
(he just took a bite of the Chinese food ) This is terrible. What is this, ginger? I hate ginger. I can't understand how anyone can eat ginger. (puts the container back in the refrigerator.)
Listen. I want you guys to send along those agreements the minute you land. Our boys can't wait to kick your butts!
If I do it, will you buy a computer?
Cause its signals, Jerry, its signals! (snapping his fingers) Dont you- all right. Did she even ask you, what you were doin tomorrow night, if you were busy?
No, you're not a divorcee. Youre just separated. You're---you're a separatee.
Morgan? No. He's doing a great job. (winks)
S'cuse me ..Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?
Yes! Yes. You know. She didn't know about Pasteurization. He didn't know anout Fumigation. But they made it work!
Parking in a handicap spot. Right in the middle of his United Volunteers meeting. When he got back, he chased after me with a baseball bat.
I can't carry a pen. I'm afraid I'll puncture my scrotum.
No, that's right, I didn't. I take full responsibility for the card not being here. I, uh, . . .
What I said? I say stupid things all the time I can't go two minutes without saying stupid things.
I doubt it. You know what he's doing now? He's putting a pool table in my old bedroom.
(Still holding the note) I think I'm having a heart attack.
Awright, lemme just say this. Ten thousand dollars, alright, and now I'm going below what you wanted to pay. You have your dinner, have your veal, or whatever it is. Enjoy...
I'm starving. We should have had lunch first..
Oh no no no, they don't want to join us.
if you hadn't come, this whole thing wouldn't have happen (back on Jerry and Elaine's side, we can hear George saying "I was the one who was invited", Jerry opens the door)
No sports jacket? I don't need a sports jacket? Writers wear sports jackets.
Take it easy. Take it easy. It's not the end of the world.
You-you sure you never slept with her? (Jerry shakes his head 'no') Perfect.
(coming back to the table from the bathroom) Oh uh. You ready?
What a bald paradise that must have been. Nobody knew.
(surprised) So, I'm Neil? How did I do that?
You see I disagree. I'd rather be dating the blind. You know you could let the house go. You could let yourself go. A good looking blind woman doesn't even know you're not good enough for her.
Yes, for a sales position. Latex salesman, the selling of latex, and latex related products. They just wouldn't give me a chance.
It was on a magazine! And it still had the doily on.
(Stopping him) Ah, excuse me. When your, uh, when your wallet was open, I - I glanced inside, and I couldnt help but notice that you have several crisp dollar bills.
I got to tell you I felt terrible. I really thought she was going to collapse and kill herself.
Wait. Whoa! That's the Rabbi from Elaine's building. I just met this guy the other day.
Alright, I just have to go over to the Ross' apartment and drop off Susan's sunglasses. You'll come with me?
You know how easy it is for dead people to travel? Its not like getting on a bus. One second. (snaps his fingers) Its all mental.
Sometimes in life, the gods smile upon you, my friends.
Well, I didn't really think about what I was gonna do with all..
(humble) Well, if you must know, shhhe, was my fiance, Susan. May she rest in peace.
No no no, you know actually we are friends of a serial killer.
Jay Crespi, how am I gonna forget Jay Crespi?
Yes. Yes. Care. You know who I think about a lot? Remember SUSAN ? The one that used to work for NBC?
(Yelling from the bathroom) Don't tell her anything, she'll kill me!!
I just can't believe at the way people are. What is it with humanity? What kind of a world do we live in?
Yeah, it bothers me. Doesn't it bother you?
The Chinese have done it my friend. The Chinese have done it.
Would you stop that please. Would you just stop that?
Oh that's OK, really, don't worry about it.
So she doesn't want to see me anymore.
Lloyd Braun? What d'you have to meet him for?
She put them in her pocketbook. I guess she took them with her.
You know this whole thing never would have happened if you hadn't bailed out on me at the restaurant.
you said "step off"? wow, that is too much hey..huh hey (George turns the cap his wearing backwards like Tony) Tony, I huh, I just had this brainstorm for us. Can you guess what it is?
Say it's Saturday night in Spain. They go out dancing. You think they do the flamenco?
I told I had a bus transfer that was only good just for another hour.
You know what I never understood? Why did they change the siren noise? When I was a kid it was always "waaaa, waaaa", you know now it "woo-woo-woo-woo-woo". Why did they do that, did they do some research? Did they find that woo-woo was more effective than waa?
(annoyed) Not a peep. They just cleaned the carpets and left. Call themselves a cult!
Because, if I'm looking straight ahead, and something enters my field of vision, that's merely a happenstance. (Elaine loudly snaps and unfolds her napkin at the next table to get Russell's attention.)
You think this is the plane that Ted Danson gets?
(Defensively) You can look at them, but do NOT touch them. (Holds them out)
Yes well unfortunately you'll never get the chance to find out.
What? Every time I leave my house now I have to call everybody I know and ask them if they want to do what I'm doing?
(Definite) I'll take it in my room. (Walks off)
(depressed) Feel like I can't do anything wrong.
(thinks for a second) I got used to it.
I gotta call her. Should I call her?
(seeing Jerry's van shaking) What is that? That van's a-rockin'.
This car out there is taking up, like, three parking spaces.
Monica, I'm really focused here, this stuff's a killer. (turns to the next page)
Going to need a little more coffee here.
(frantic by now) SHUT UP,SHUT UP, SHUT UP,...(then leaves)
(Holding up Kramer's book) According to this, it took.. 10 hours. It eased into the water like an old man into a nice warm bath - no offence. (Pause) So, uh, Clarence, how about abandoning this apartment, and letting me shove off in this beauty?
I dont know whatcha had to tell her that for. You put me in a very difficult position, Marine Biologist! I'm very uncomfortable with this whole thing.
(afraid not) No no, no no no. You're not goin' in there.
Awright, listen, can you uh, gimme a lift back to my place?
It took a couple of hours of convincing. I was persistent. I was just like those guys in the movies. And it worked! She said "Yes"! I can't believe my luck that she was still available . A beautiful woman like that. You think she's good looking, right?
Pull hair, Poke eyes, Groin stuff. Whatever I gotta do. (he opens a blue bottled beverage)
(to a street vender selling hot dogs) You must hate hot dogs, huh? Or else, you, uh, you really like 'em and that's why you, you do this.
(agitated) Well, I, I couldn't come. I, I had to drive my mother to, to the chiropodist.
All right, I want you to do me a favor.
Anything, everything, something, nothing - Who the hell cares? Put me down. I'm down!
Oh no, Morgan is a good man sir.
Okay. Now, why do I have to see (points) you?
The uniforms! Did you see how they played? Listen to these comments! (reads from the paper) "Wade Boggs 'What a fabric! Finally we can breathe.' Luis Palonia 'Cotton is king.' Paul O'Neill 'I never dreamed anything could be so soft and fluffy.' "
After dark? Please. At their age, that's like swallowing stun grenades.
(While pointing at Jerry) Not me! Him! His fault! He betrayed me!
Youre a fine person. Youre a humanitarian. Shes very sexy.
Are you often on business trip? Nice...oh, hey nice ice-bucket.
An apartment-warming gift? We got to give presents to people for moving? Birthdays, Christmas, it's enough gifts. I would like one month off.
Yeah. And since you go buy there everyday. I was hoping that we could help each other out.
I'm George.. George Costanza.. I've never been in the hospital a day in my life.. except when I had my tonsils out. You know, they never gave me any ice cream. I always felt that-
Oh, the nose job. I don't know, what did you think?
Well, I like a rolling writer. They're very smooth.
Ohh, hey there, young fella. (They shake hands) What's your major?
You think your parents would have any objections to taking a little kid to Paris with them? (Jerry looks at him confused) It turns out that the kid's father lives in Paris. (chuckling) Is that a coincidence? (Jerry smilies) Eh you know Alec wants me to take him over there so I figure as long as they're going (claps)
It gets here when it gets here. Would you stop ridin' me?
(puts down handset) Because he'll know I told you. Besides, he's giving me a parking spot around the corner for practically nothing.
See, I think people would talk about it at the coffee machines.
I tell you, I really don't think so-called relationship humor is what this show is all about.
Mothers say things. My mother goes babbling on and on like a crazy person.
She invited me up. Coffees not coffee, coffee is sex.
Im aware of you. (to Jerry) All right, lets go (opens the bathroom door) Lets go!
Well, losing a loved is, uh...I mean, forget about it. (Starts wolfing down the sandwiches.)
Wha! You know, it's a pain to change that. You gotta lift up that plastic thing with a pen.
Yeah, people who work at NORAD, whore on twenty-four hour missile watch. Everything was going along so great. She was laughing, I was funny... I kept saying to myself, Keep it up, dont blow it, youre doing great.
So... uh you feel okay about that whole thing... what we do in there... you're generally okay with everything in there?
Ahoy! Mr. Eldridge. I understand you were on the Andrea Doria.
Well? (Miranda hits George) I was just - I'm curious, that's all. We, uh. We'd like you to, do everything possible.
Hey, what's another million, give or take. I get off where and when I wanna get off.
So let's say in her mind she witnessed a pick. Okay, so then what?
I dont know, I cant eat. You, you cant have anything anymore. Look at this, look at this. Eggs out. Coffee out. French fries out. BLT out! I go to visit my grandparents three big brisket sandwiches, Im sittin here with a carrot! Theyre closing in on a hundred, Im sayin to them, How can you eat that stuff? (They look at their menus again.) Im so sick about losin that choose, you dont know.
(Entering Jerry's apartment with a cartload of computers) Jerry, I've found a way to beat Lloyd Braun! I buy the computers myself, I store 'em in your apartment. Then, after I win the contest, I bring 'em all back and get my money back. Ha ha! It's brilliant. What? What's wrong with your leg?
I can't run, I have a bad hamstring.
Ahh, Steinbrenner gave 'em to us, in honour of Phil Rizzuto being inducted into the Hall of Fame.
Well it's not fair, Jerry. It's just not fair. All right, all right. That's it. I'm getting out of this thing.
So you're gonna let me get suspended for shower urination?
He got about uh, two inches from... there.
You know what? I can't do this. I can't read books anymore; books on tape have ruined me, Jerry. I need that nice voice. This book has *my* voice. I hate my voice.
Hennigans. I was there sitting in the office and the cleaning woman comes in. I've always been attracted to cleaning women. Cleaning women, chambermaids.
Oh, you know what you're like? You're like a pathetic gambler. You're one of those losers in Las Vegas who keeps thinking he's gonna come up with a way to win at blackjack.
Elaine, shes a psychic. She knows how the kids going to be.
Look at me! I am man! I am you!
Well, that interests me very much Mr. Farkus.Very much indeed, sir.
Look it's no secret what's going on between us. (to Jerry) She doesn't like me. Now Jerry if you don't mind.
Yeah, but if you still look closely you can see ah, a little bump where the nose use to be. huhuhuhu.
Amazing. I drive them to lesbianism, he brings 'em back.
I don't know, I just can't. Nobody in my family can pay for parking, it's a sickness. My father never paid for parking; my mother, my brother, nobody. We can't do it.
Yeah.( reaches for the purse and finds a piece of paper . he looks annoyed.
No, No! She's going out with a friend of mine. It's only courteous that we should try and like each other.
Um, excuse me, have you see a guy with like a horse face, big teeth, and a, and a pointed nose?
I-I don't know. Last time I got the tap.
Ah ha, well, I really wouldn't know about that. I don't watch much TV. I like to read. So what do you do, a lot of that "did you ever notice?" this kind of stuff.
What's going on? He still wants to have dinner with us?
Wait a second, wait a second...and then the butler says, "I'm not cleanin' it up! I'm sick of cleaning!"
No, I decided to go with an '89 LeBaron.
Where did I get the coffee? Where do think I got the coffee, at the grocery store. (small laugh)
(bursting out of the bathroom, fumbling with his fly) Button fly! Why do they put buttons on a fly? It takes ten minutes to get these things open!
What about your old car? They couldn't get Kramer's blood out of it?
Susan Davis? (Getting possessive) Hey, wait a second..
Because I uh, I told her the truth.
(to himself) A cane. I knew it. (to Neil) So, we meet at last. I admire your skills, Mr Peanut.
I really can not comprehend how stupid people could be sometimes. Can you comprehend it?
(clearing his throat, he changes his order for Susan) Baked, uh, potato.
Tennis courts? W-w-what about the yard? Where do they have the gang fights?
Because I'm REFRESHED. I finally found a way to sleep in my office. Under the desk. I lie on my back. I tuck in the chair. I'm invisible.
Because important things go in a case. You got a skull for your brain, a plastic sleeve for your comb, and a wallet for your money.
(through a mouthful of shrimp) Well, why don't we just put a monitor in his skybox?
Wa, uh, thank you sir, you know I am not quite sure I'm right for it.
I know. I know. That's what I do. That's what I do.
So, I broke up with Maura. It's done. I'm out.
Yeah, yeah. Just delivering some presents to my folks.
Hey. I got Jon Voight's LeBaron. (Jingles the keys.)
I tell you, when she threw that toupee out the window, it was the best thing that ever happened to me. I feel like my old self again. Totally inadequate, completely insecure, paranoid, neurotic, it's a pleasure.
Make myself comfortable. What does that mean? Does she want me to take my clothes off? Is she taking her clothes off? What if I take my clothes off and she still has hers' on? Then I really look like an idiot. She could get offended and leave. So maybe I should leave them on, but what then if she takes her off? Then she'll feel humiliated. 'Make yourself comfortable'. I got this unbelievable woman and this 'comfortable'-thing can ruin me. I got it! I take my shoes off and sit on the bed. There, that's comfortable. She can't accuse me being unconvertible.
Well, sometimes you can't help these people 'til they hit rock bottom.
We sat there for twenty minutes, chewing, staring at each other in a defunct relationship.
Donna. Oh, youre the one that likes that commercial!
Yes, sir, that was a good sandwich, sir.
So? For a twenty-five dollar cleaning, I can listen to some pointless blather.
There was no meeting. (gets one of the folding chairs) But it was quite a meeting. You are looking at the next director of Mets scouting. The only thing is, I have to get fired from the Yankees first.
I can't sell the book. It's been marked.
Ah, a, You know what, maybe I'll just come ... umm, yummm (stammering)
Alright. I'll run it by a few people.
Yes, a shame. That is exactly how I would put it. Now Mrs. Sweedler, with all due discretion and sensitivity, and taking in the whole scope of the situation, I just can't help but think that, the hospital is somehow responsible for compensating the other, still living 'victim' of horrendous, horrendous tragedy.
Hey hey hey, we're in a rush here.
How much are we gonna get for this? Fifty, sixty thousand?
I don't think we should see each other anymore. You're great but I'm I'm riddled with personal problems.
But, but I'm disturbed! I'm depressed! I'm inadequate! I got it all!!
(Quickly making it up) Well, possibly. I wrote an off-Broadway show, "La Cocina." ..Actually, it was off-off-Broadway. It was a comedy about a Mexican chef.
Let me ask you this. If you stick your hand in the hair is it easy to get it out?
Because! Because, as the leader...if I die...then all hope is lost! Who would lead? The clown? Instead of castigating me, you should all be thanking me. What kind of a topsy-turvy world do we live in, where-where heroes are cast as villains? Brave men as cowards?
Absolutely. Because instead of doing a wash, I just keep buying underwear. My goal is to have over three hundred and sixty pair. That way, I only have to do wash once a year.
Well, they hurt him bad. Really hurt his feelings. It's a long story. I- I don't like to talk about it, but I swore then that I would never work for big broker-houses. See, all they care about is money. I'm about more than money, I'm about people, always gone my own way and I've never looked back.
I get the feeling when lesbians are looking at me, they're thinking "That's why I'm not heterosexual".
25 kids for his birthday party? (to kid under table) Don't put your tongue on the floor! He's putting his tongue on the floor! Here, here, have some more sugar packets. (tosses some Equal packets under the table)
(worked up) Because if she gets it back, then you'll have no reason to be sour. You'll de-sour, right?
(jokingly) You are still paying for this lunch?
I'm going to a poetry reading with PATRICE First time poets, in a burnt out building, down by the docks, Supposed to be good.
(getting excited) That's, that's incredible. My Cousin Vinnie, I love her, she was fantastic!
Bender? He cant play left. He stinks. I just dont see what purpose is it gonna serve your going? I mean, you think dead peole care whos at their funeral? They dont even know theyre having a funeral. Its not like shes hanging out in the back going, I cant believe Jerry didnt show up.
All right, you know you're not any help at all here. I don't know what even the point is of talking to you anymore.
She called my office. She said shes been in the Hamptons since Sunday. She didnt know if I was trying to get in touch with her. Her machine broke, and shes been using her old machine and she doesnt have the beeper for it.
People always leave old things in their medicine cabinet.
Well, Tony.. took a bit of a tumble
Kramer was on Murphy Brown? That son of a gun!
Uh why don't you wait then go in the movies?
(checking the fridge) No Chinese leftovers. George is gettin' suspicious.
March 21st. Hey! So, you're gonna back me on this, right?
(Gloating) Hey, you got any extra furniture down there? I need some more stuff to fill that extra bedroom with the walk-in closet. (Smiles)
Yeah, yeah, right here. (hands it to him)
Yes I look forward to many years of... looking at the triangles. Well, I'll ah, I'll wait for you outside.
Well I've never met your sister but obviously these are not hard-and-fast rules. (to the waitress) Darling, the tea is getting a little cold sweetheart.
Are you sure? Oh, look who I'm talking to. The president of NBC. (forced laughter)
Listen, I gotta ask you I was a little concerned that perhaps I was responsible in some way for your, uh... metamorphosis.
Why did you even take it? You broke up with her!
(singing) Master of the house/Doling out the charm/Ready with a handshake and an open...
You know, Einstein wore the exact same outfit every day.
We were in the lobby during the intermission of the play. I was buying her one of those containers of orange drink, for five dollars. I reached into my pocket to pay for it, I looked down; theres this piece of green floss hanging from my fingers.
I'll get him to see a real doctor. You just stay away from this.
He said he didn't know what it was.
Yeah, much better. All right, so what's the move, because I need *something*. This woman I'm dating, it's like she's doing her nails during love-making.
Uh, heading out. Jerry really hates to miss the coming attractions.
Yeah, Jimmy why don't you wait outside, you know, play with something.
I dont know. Just start scratching. Tell him you have the crabs. He was in the military. Hell understand that.
Hehehehehe (higher tone laugh, though still quietly )
I didn't shave this morning. I don't feel like myself.
What are you talking about? How can you sit there and look me in the eye and tell that me you're not worried?! Don't you have any *sense*?!! Don't you have a brain!? Are you so completely senile that you don't know what you're talkin about Anymore!!?!
Attention Steinbrenner and front-office morons! Your triumphs mean nothing. You all stink. You can sit on it, and rotate! This is George Costanza. I fear no reprisal. Extension five-one-seven-oh.
I'm really going to do something with these three months.
Well, last night she told me that she liked you. Not you, the disturbed you, so I had to tell her the truth.
I dont want to get out of it.
Lets not forget the radiator. The steam has been on here for ten years. No human can turn this off.
Sure. So, uh, Jerry, there's an empty apartment in my building. If you and Hallie want, we could try and hold it, may...
kissed me. We both had tears streaming down our faces. I never saw anyone so beautiful. It was at that moment that I decided to tell her that, I was not a marine biologist.
(little worried) Coffee? (thinks) I can beat that. Move in with me.
(somewhat annoyed) I suppose you could be an architect.
Well, it's just, all you said was 'your welcome', which is nice. It's very nice. But... I feel I gotta get the apology.
If I see things as they are, I would ask 'why' or 'why not?'
Well, I could be a little sweetie tweetie weetie weetie.
(Vowing) Well, I'll tell you this, though - I am never doing.. that , again.
(In a state of hysteria) I'm an eggplant! I'm an eggplant! I'm a minstrel man!
I never assisted in a birth before. Its really quite disgusting.
So you're a lawyer. What kind of cases do you handle?
Wait a minute. This looks familiar. This reminds me of something. I can do this.
No, no that can happen. Ive, uh, Ive read about that in medical journals. Its a freak thing, but...
I don't even like to use urinals, always been a stall man.
What was the tallest woman you ever slept with?
You know it's a public phone, you're not supposed to just chit-chat.
(singing; imitating Tony Bennett) You know, Id go from nods to nothing...
I am such a Huge whale fan. These marine biologists were showin' how they communicate with each other with these squeaks and squeals, what a fish!
This...is an organizer, a secretary, and a friend.
Well, it was a hell of a ride.
There must be some way to find out.
Squirrel? Well, we have no deal with THEM!
Yes, yes, but uh, I have to make a call, so...
Elaine said your pretty good at this stuff.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's it. More of that, difficult. I'm a difficult seed.
Hey Kramer, c'mon-- it was 240 bucks twenty years ago...
I was personable. Don't you think I was personable?
I'll leave when the guy comes in. I gotta tell you, I am loving this yada yada thing. You know, I can cross over my whole life story. (Picks up dental tool)
I, uh, just think it's a little unusual. Two people to sit on one side...and leave the other side empty.
Well, I feel better already. I'm feelin' like a good person.
Really...(he honks the car and is startled, Elaine laughs)......I have to say...You were really good doing that porno thing....you're talented.
I guarantee you that Moses was a picker. You wander throughh the desert for forty years with that dry air. ... You telling me you're not going to have occasion to clean house a little bit.
horning on my rock climbing trip. It's just supposed to be me and Tony
They got a billion people over there and he found a relative.
Honesty, hard-work, these are the values that I was raised on. The most important thing Joey, is to be able to look yourself in the mirror before you go to sleep at night.
(Eating) Oh yeah. These are fantastic, fantastic. (To server) You know, I'd love to get a jump on the next batch, where do you come out? (Server leaves) (To Anna) She's been ignoring this section all night. Quesadilla?
I have to talk to you about something .
(shouting) Turn your key, Maura. Turn your key!
(gasping) I think I swallowed a fly! I swallowed a fly! What do I do? (He turns to a coffee shop patron at the counter.) What can happen?!
Look at these salesmen. The only thing these guys fear is the walk-out. No matter what they say, you say, "Ill walk out of here right now!"
(Rubbing his stomach) Ooh.. Something's not sitting right..
When I was ten years old, my parents had this very same statue on the mantle of our apartment. Exactly. And, one day, I grabbed it, and I was using it as a microphone. I was singing, MacArthur Park, and I got to the part about, Ill never have that recipe again, and it slipped out of my hand and it broke. My parents looked at me like I smashed the ten commandments. To this day, they bring it up. It was the single most damaging experience in my life, aside from seeing my father naked.
So what have you been doing with yourself?
You want my friend to ask his uncle, a man who just lost his wife of 44 years, for a death certificate so that he can save a few bucks on a flight?
Yeah, it's bizarre. (they both look around them suspiciously)
Yeah, no pop-in, no "in the neighborhood," no "I saw your light was on." And the best part is, if things go really well...
Excuse me. I believe you just ate my Twix bar. It was dangling. And when you purchased your Twix bar, you got a little freebie, and you never bothered to ask why, or seek out its rightful owner.
The cashier is at lunch - which is where Id like to be.
Whoop! Too late. I think he picked up the scent.
Alright. Uh, well, I'm out of here. (Gets up to leave)
Yeeeaaah. (Jerry and George lean in to make their conversation a little more private) Well..... I've never really felt confident in uh..... one particular aspect.
You really think this looks O.K. on me?
Oh, look, he's going to ask you about my arm. So, just tell him I banged it against a desk. And it's been moving involuntarily ever since.
Well, I think you're wrong about that. [Elaine walks past the window again, glancing in] And ah now if you'll excuse me, I'd really like to get started, please.
(penny drops) Oh, uh, wait a minute, wait a minute. (snorts) Is this about money?
I believe the doors on the bathroom stalls, here at the stadium, don't offer much by way of privacy. But I was thinking if we extend the doors all the way to the floors......
Why is nice bad? What kind a of sick society we are living in, when nice is bad?
I'll tell you what I'd like to do. I'd like to replace that rye.
Say you go to the bathroom at two o'clock in the morning, what's the outfit? I mean, you dressing up or is it come as you are?
I like sports. I could do something in sports.
My presence, in that office, can only hurt my chances.
All Simons was able to find out is that hes in the hospital.
I'd love to be a Civil War buff. ... What do you have to do to be a buff
(confessing) Well, actually, I thought it up on the way over here.
all right! rock-climbing! J..just the 2 of us? alright! hey I'll make some sandwiches, what what do you like? tuna? peanut butter?
(sensing his chance) Well, they do now. Neighborhood's changing.
(Getting in a more panicked state) Oh God, Mommy!
Oh, no, no. Twix is the only candy with the cookie crunch.
Hmm. What about a hole? You ever put anybody in "the box"?
She doesn't like. Here is your blue one, it's her favorite. (Takes sweater out of his bag.)
But I'm backing in! You can't put it in head first!
All right we got the wine. Aren't we lucky? We got wine. Whoopee Whoa! Imagine if we didn't bring the wine. We'd be shunned by society. Outcasts! WHERE'S YOUR WINE? GET OUT!
They want you to do a TV show?
All right, all right. KNOCK IT OFF. Come on, let's go.
(going into the bathroom) Well, you on all fours, that thing vibratin', kickin' up sawdust, ho ho! She'll get the picture!
Well what did you want her to do, you left it on the night table.
Boy, I wish the flamenco was popular here.
What did I get or what do I say I got?
(Sincerely) Thank you.. I, uh.. that might not work out.
(tormented) Aw, shut up Jerry! Just shut up!
What a fascinating turn of events. (Waitress approaches)
I don't know why I bother even talking to you.
Yes, Id like to report a problem with one of your mechanics.
(MUMBLING) You come to a parking lot, you write it down. How hard is that?
No, I can't. She knows I go there. It's not secure. (the call waiting beeps) Hey, I got another call comin' in. I gotta let the machine get it. Bye. (hangs up)
Don't you believe me? It's their fiftieth anniversary. You know this is gonna kill him. You're aware of that. Kill him. On the biggest night of his life...
(thinking to himself) Oh my god, there she is. That's the face, just like the picture.
Well, maybe so...but it was good enough for Mr. Jon Voight.
Why can't we do this on the phone? What's Kramer doing now?
Oh, Rita. Hey, Mr. Shermack, how're you doing, good to see you. Jay, always a pleasure. (To Susan) Sweetie. (Kisses her and then sits down next to Jerry) Yeah, yeah, that butler idea, that's beautiful. Isn't that killer? (Aside to Jerry) I thought I was getting the butler.
Look, we're wasting our time here! We're a half-hour late, they've probably took it off the board already.
Yeah. Never seen anyone so bored. I'm working like a dog here. Give me a moan. *Something*. I'd settle for a belch, for god's sake. All right, come on, let's have it.
Thats all there is to it. By Christmas day I will be Brother Costanza.
(laughing) Have something else. Cmon, have a little dessert?
Did you ever solve the riddle of the pie?
If she doesnt show up, we cant possibly have dinner with him alone.
Jerry! I did it! Haha! I beat Braun!
All right, I've got to go down to the unemployment office. Wanna take a walk?
I wonder what toilet paper was loike in the 1860's. Did they carry it in rolls in their duffle bags?
You know, you're going along, you think everything's all right and all of a sudden you get that tap. (George taps his own shoulder). You know it's like pfffff (whistling sound), all right that's enough, you're through.
Hey, Nina! (beat) I owe you some money, don't I?
Oh, I, uh, I disagree. You've, uh, you've been living in America too long. (indicates the bag of oranges) You've forgotten what it's like to have no oranges.
They're -- They're killing independent George! And they're, they're all in on it! World's are colliding!
Well no not yet, you gotta buy french stamps (pauses) I-I'll reimburse you of course.
Oh - comfort, schmomfort. Listen, Father, can I ask you a question? In a terrible time like this...who would I get the death certificate from?
(Smiling to himself) You don't have to worry about me. (Nodding, gloating) I won a contest.
All right, stop it! Stay away from my breasts! Chest!
Dwayne, my friend and I would like to exchange frames. Could you put his lenses in my frames and mine in his?
He's an obscure writer. Betnik, on the village.
Why didn't you ask me? I know a million theater jokes. 'What's the deal with those guys down in the pit?'
Yeah, that's what I want-- triangles. Alright, I'm outta here. Have fun with what's-her-name.
(at dinner with his cousin) Some more merlot?
Come on. Ya wanna go get some lunch?
And who's responsible for making hate mongering and fascism popular again?
Let me tell you something. No one walks into a beauty parlor and says "Give me the Larry Fine."
I think he was trying to tell me something, like it had some sort of a meaning.
You know what, I'll just uh, I'll just look around for a little while. (moving to come round the counter) I'll just browse around.
(examining reflection) I really think this looks pretty good.
(seeing Elaine and Puddy come into Monk's) Yeah. Hey, Lainie, Puddy.
Kramer, hey, hey! (Gets up out of his seat)
Pack of gum. Here you go. (hands the clerk a $100 bill)
Where you going? I-I thought I could count on you for a little compassion.
Sorry I'm late, but look what I found in the Yankee Hall of Pride display case.
So I said, "Mr. Hayman, It's me george Costanza, JFK, ... " He doesn't move. So I said uh, "Can't stand ya'", "Can't stand ya'" He turns and smiles, the little baked bean teeth. I get up to run away, but something was holding me back. It was Heyman. He had my underwear. There I was on the steps of the 42nd St. library , a grown man, getting a wedgie.
Oh geeeee. (George pantomimes sticking a knife in his heart, and twists it.) Go, go!
Sid, who's gonna move the cars while you're away?
(Talking about his would-be apartment) You could fit 15 people in that bathroom..
(Putting his jacket on) I'd like to apologize. I want to tell him I.. I.. didn't mean to get him in trouble.
The show! Forget about the show! We should take the idea to a different network
I had to listen to a five minute discussion on which one is actually called shmoopy.
When I find that guy, this much I vow those glasses will be returned to their rightful owner.
Her scalp was clean. She had a nice skull. There just wasn't a lot of hair on it.
No, you go Guggenheim. I'm not much of a Guggenheim.
Nevertheless.. I was wondering if you and your .friends are doing business here at the Jiffy Park.... You know ..hum What do you people call it? Turning tricks? Anyway I...I....found a condom in my car....and I'm not saying it's yours but.... I want to know if I should just change parking lots.
I hurt it in a hotel room. You know where they tuck the covers in real tight in those hotel rooms? I can't sleep like that so I tried to kick it out and I pulled it.
She's confiding in him about our dates. You always like the person you talk to about the date more than the date! It's just a matter of time till they realize, 'Hey, we could have sex.'
You had to hop! You had to hop on the plane.
Come on, how hard is that? Look at all the junk that's on TV. You want an idea? Here's an idea. You coach gymnastics team in high school. And you're married. And your son's not interested in gymnastics and you're pushing him into gymnastics.
Well, I still think you shoulda told me.
We are really late now. We're in big trouble. Big trouble.
Ma, will you stop?... Its just a statue!... How is it my fault?!... It was stolen. I didnt even touch it this time... Okay, fine... I dont see why this should affect to potatoes!... Okay... Goodbye. (George hangs up.) She doesnt react to disappointment very well. Unlike me.
(Leaving) I'll store these over at Kramer's apartment.
She's right, I heard Kramer got mugged out on the suburbs on a baby-sitting gig.
I've just met her but I'm very impressed.
She probably gets that impression because you're cool. You're under control. Like me. Nothing wrong with that.
(quietly) That's uh, for the two of us.
Great! (snaps fingers and grabs the extra plane ticket) Nina could go, huh? Jerry, this is great. You and Elaine. Me and Nina.
So, he made an appointment for me to see Dinkins' doctor. He's just trying to humiliate me.
(Reading) I see here that you play the harp.. tell me, why do you have to tilt it? Can't you just build it on an angle? It'd save you a lot of trouble.
Almost. Couldn't get the girl go out with me the second time.
I'm grotesque . I look like a troll.
(To himself) So you're havin' the sex, next day you don't have to call. That's pretty good. (Back to Jerry) Go ahead.
Well, it's a tough decision. I have to wear these every day. I'm deciding on a new face.
You told him? What did you tell him?
As you will see, the candy bar is paid for, and yet, remains dangling in the machine. (Notices that the Twix slot is completely empty) Hey, its gone. Where is my Twix? (Quickly looks around. His sights fall on the window of a door labeled "Employees Only". The same mechanic from before is eating a candy bar) What?! That guys eatin it!
Really? (Jerry nods his head) Well, what if it doesnt stop? Oh, that I really needed to hear. That helps a lot! All right, just say something. Just start talking. Change the subject. Lets just go, All right? I cant believe were having dinner with Alton Benes.
Uh, I'm just selling some of Dad's things, (looking into Kramer's eyes) that's what he would have wanted.
I told ya. Hey, any of you guys want to come out and help me fix my father's screen door in Queens?
We're gonna hang around here a little while....something funny going on here
You see if I stay the whole year, I get it all.
Look, you wanna have sex right now? Do want to have sex with me right now? Let's go! C'mon, let's go baby! C'mon!
Maybe it's got something to do with that 42 in the corner .
All right You really want to know?...It all started when she told met hat...she was the voice on your tape recorder.
I was betrayed! That kid was like a son to me. And if there's one person you should be able to hold down, it's your own flesh and blood. Like my father.. my father's father before him.
(chuckling to himself) Housewarming gift. (swerving the car to go to the antique stand) All right, we're taking it up a notch!
What is that, immigrants come over, you show them how to act natural?
Oh what's the difference? We'll all be dead eventually.
You don't want to suffer with this all weekend.
Yeah. It's a beautiful name for a boy or a girl...
The guy who pitched him the show with the stories about nothing. (snaps fingers) Jerry Seinfeld. Jerry Seinfeld's friend.
What do you need her for? There's a million lawyers.
Alright, alright! We'll buy her a wheelchair! Wheelchairs, engagement presents.. IT NEVER ENDS!
Oh, she's got the hue. So, what's going on with you and Melanie? I mean, I know you're not getting married, but uh, things are happening?
Did you here that? I can't believe this he's eating his sandwich.
Yeah, this is my first time here. (nudges Jerry again)
No no no no no, this has to be carefully orchestrated. You go to a fancy dinner, flowers...
If it makes you happy, I don't focus on these things. I will tell you this Unfortunately, we live in a very superficial society. I don't condone it, but it's a fact of life.
Alright, alright, I'll call Heather, you'll get your hat back, I will get a second date. Ha ha ha. Now watch the magic.
You know, I cant believe youre even considering not playing. We need you. Youre hitting everything.
Well, sorry I missed that, uh, charity thing. But this was one of those truly glorious Hampton weekends that you always hear about.
Well, you got no place to go. I'll tell you what your problem is You brought your queen out too fast. What do you think? She's one of these feminists looking to get out of the house? No, the queen is old fashioned. . Likes to stay home. Cook. Take care of her man. Make sure he feels good.
What is this 'saving movies' thing? Something's playing, you go.
That's right, you heard me. Get out! You are ruining this whole experience for me!
That's it. That's the line... (squirts mustard into Jerry's coffee and stirs it) ...that destroyed my life.
What, what happened? Where's, where's all the stuff?
Eh, I can't. I gotta go down to the foundation. I'm interviewing high schoolers for the Susan Ross.. scholarship.
All right, let's postpone it. Let's get out of here.
How are we gonna get out of here? We need a plan!
Yeah, yeah, well, because of the cane. You should see the bathroom they gave me!
Do you hold the neck together with one hand, or are you just letting it flap in the breeze?
Why did the policeman have to yell at me like that? (Elaine enters)
Hey, people, people, people, people, people. Not bad, huh? Excuse me.
Um, excuse me, I think you forgot my bread.
Hey by the way my parents really want to have your parents over dinner before they leave town.
The Rosses have started up a foundation, Jerry, and I have to sit on the board of directors.
Well I don't know anyone here Jerry. Where else am I going to stay?
So, attractive one day - not attractive the next?
I can't believe you're really going out with a woman named Lois.
I don't understand lunch, I don't know anything about lunch. Listen. Just because I got the guy fired doesn't mean I turned him into a bum - does it?
(spins his chair back to face her) So you got a $25,000 a year raise.
(con't) A-Anyway, I was thinking we would take two cars up to the cabin and that way if one of wanted to stay you know...
You'll have your turn! The truth must be heard. (Plays back the tape.) That's all there was. And yet, it speaks volumes. A low rumple. A metallic 'squink.' A 'glonk.' Someone crying out..."Dear God!" Let's start with, uh...with you, Wyck.
I don't know. I closed my eyes and made a move.
(Studying the salt shaker) I'm not taking a civil service test.
And that was wrong, Jerry! You simple must to apologize..
Sounds like a scam. (takes a bite from the granola bar)
No. And he's not a pig-man is he?
No, no no. That skips a generation. The baldness gene comes from your grandfather.
(incredulity) Him you brainwashed! (angry shout) What's he got that I don't have?!
Hey, at least I'm bringing something to this. (Starts flipping through envelopes, reads one ) "Have you seen me?" (Flicks it aside) Nope. (looks at next envelope) Woah, something from Whatley.
Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot. I'll pay you back.
No! I am not going to see a psychiatrist!
You know, my arm feels a lot better. That Wendy really knows her stuff. (he writes out a cheque)
Fitted Hat Day! That's what you asked Steinbrenner for?
I dont know. But I dont. Im actually almost happy to hear it.
Maybe she could like me? Is it that far fetched? Maybe she sees something? Is it possible?
I know. I cut the button off and poked a hole with a letter opener.
Hu-Yeah, interest. It's an amazing thing. You make money without doing anything...
Oh I would love that. You think he'd really do it?
Ah! Health's not good enough. I want more than health. Health's not doing it for me anymore. I'm sick of health.
Hey, last night, I found a whole Weeble Village right behind the EZ Bake oven.
I didn't know whether to try and keep her from falling, or zip up.
What? Elaine's big-head guy? They have you the apartment?!
You know, I can't talk to you anymore.
Yeah, of course she did. That's all I ever heard growing up is 'Why can't you be more like Lloyd Braun?' Did you know he was in a mental institution?
That was a hell of a thing when Spock died...
I don't even drink wine. I drink Pepsi.
I gotta find a way to work this out, I love that apartment. It's so cozy, I'm ensconced in velvet. You know, if it were socially acceptable--
Oh, well, uh. Gary told me you said hi.
Really? And Debby told me that she fell in love with him because he has all this perspective!
(adamant) Ah, c'mon! I'm telling you, I can coach for the NFL. It's not that hard
Well, that pear shaped loser was me! And I was in that photo, until I broke in here, stole the photograph and airbrushed myself out of there!
Well, wait a little while, Ma. What's the difference?
Let me tell you something about that tag. It's no 31, and uh...let's just leave it at that.
Hey. I've kept the same job for more than two years. It's not luck. Elaine, have you ever sent a racy photograph of yourself to anyone?
Did you see that? That-that pigeon didn't move! I had to swerve to get out of the way! I saved that pigeons life!
What are you doing? Where do you think you're going?
Yes, I am familiar with this syndrome -- she's a two-face.
Well, I'm sure at some point between the years 800 and 1200--somewhere--there were two women living together.
"Ah! your just mad 'cause we beat ya."
We are going to the Knick game! Michael Jordan!
Oh! Modelling! What's that like? Fun? Ha ha. (to self in head) Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!
I forgot to ask you; how did the revenge date go?
Is that right? I just threw away a lifetime of guilt-free sex, and floor seats for ever sporting event in Madison Square Garden. So please, a little respect. For I am Costanza Lord of the Idiots!
I don't think we should. We really don't know each other very well.
You're not really gonna go to California, are you?
Helping people... Of course. Of course! It makes perfect sense! How could I *not* be doing this!? I am gonna help somebody, Dammit!
Tsst...'Course I have. Come on. My cousin's in a bubble. My friend Jeffrey's uh, sister, also ... bubble ... you know. I got a lot of bubble experience. Come on.
Because Im not Latvian Orthodox. Her parents wont let her get involved with anyone who isnt Latvian Orthodox.
Oh, I find you so charming. You wuss.
This guy from my old neighborhood. Lloyd Braun. He's a big advisor to Mayor Dinkins. He thinks he's so cool.
Yes! I'm not giving him the satisfaction, it's my space.
here Elaine here, Superman (hands a comic book to Elaine, who passes it to Tony) please, next time it will only be the two of us
Yeah, see, uh, when we met, I was over there and, uh, you were over here, so the image, uh, the image was reversed, like, uh, like in the mirror.
Maybe he was going to say "Of course I have to check with my associates."
Look, I gotta tell ya...I been thinkin' about it, I just don't feel right about letting you into Elaine's apartment.
Channel eleven? Forgive me for trying to class up this place, for trying to have the Yankees reach another strata of society that might not watch channel eleven.
Yeah, but they let me go on and on all about the Hamptons, they never said a thing! You don't let somebody lie when they know you're lying. You call them a liar!
Well I guess that's because I wear boxer shorts.
I can produce Keith Hernandez right here within the hour.
Because. There was a lot of cake lying around the house. Just sitting there going with all the excess milk from all the experiments [grins]
Wait wait wait, what is she... (takes the milk can from Jerry and puts it on the table) What is she like?
Yeah my parents have it. Sometimes it skips a generation.
So, you send me to this therapist to help me with my emotional disorders, and she criticizes our script. (Tosses the script to Jerry.) What kind of a therapist is that?
Oh, this is good. This Kruger guy is clueless. I can't wait to work for him.
I'm sure I have a low IQ. I've been lying about my SAT scores for 15 years.
(through a mouthful) Long as they don't throw 'em on the field. (laughs) Huhu. (indicating dish) Help yourself to some shrimp, I brought enough for everybody.
I already bought it! I've been lyin' to you for three days, and now you're all screwin' me!
Listen, listen, dont get worked up, cause youre gonna know the whole story the minute she steps off the plane.
I hope so. I can't take him living with me much longer. He makes this kasha, it stinks up the whole house.
Oh, yeah. Still in good with the ground crew. (Laghs)
Ah you have no idea of the magnitude of this thing. If she is allowed to infiltrate this world, then George Costanza as you know him, Ceases to Exist! You see, right now, I have Relationship George, but there is also Independent George. That's the George you know, the George you grew up with -- Movie George, Coffee shop George, Liar George, Bawdy George.
Hey, Cosmo what happened to your mother last night. She hung me out to dry.
(disbelief) What? (laugh) Wh... what're you talking about? I'm not the one with the problem. (defensive) Lloyd Braun was in the nuthouse, not me.
I'll tell you what, if pig-man shows up, we'll squeeze him in. I'll see you later.
I'm not giving you the satisfaction. I'm gonna watch it again...
(jubilant) Five thousand dollars? She doesnt have five thousand dollars!
Elaine, this pilot...it doesn't matter to me, it's not me I'm concerned about...it's my mother. I've been over to the hospital to see her...
Yeah. Just take 'em out and ride 'em around for about..half an hour.
Wish I could. (raises the magazine up in front of his face and continues reading.)
Did you see that? The guy's walking away. What is wrong with you? That was a three hundred dollar profit.
Don't jinx it! Don't jinx (trails off quietly in elation)
Ye - yeah. And we had a pact, you know.
I should be in a place like this. I envy this woman. Ya' get to wear slippers all day. Friends visit. They pity you. Pity is very underrated. I like it it's good. Plus they give you those word association tests. I love those.
It's just that I was the one who actually paid for the big salad. She just happened to hand it to you. But it's no big deal.
Hate those couples. I could never bee one of those couples. There are no bald woman around. You know?
Why would I spend seven dollars to see a movie that I could watch on TV?
He's actually doing him a favor. It's less money for him to buy food.
You must be very proud Mr. Visaki. (shaking his hand) And may I say sir they're lovely girls, absolutely lovely girls. It's nice to see such fine upstanding women in gainful employment, Mr. Visaki.
(Obviously knows that, but pretends he doesn't) What, tonight? Now?
You're very good. Very good with the moanings and the gyrations. Y-You really had me going there for a minute.
Yeah. Yeah. It's the only way. Come on. What are you, kidding me?
(Thinking to himself) She's not concerned about the security guard. What kind of a person is this? I'm marrying a person who doesn't care that this man has to stand here 8 hours a day when he could easily be sitting.
I feel like I'm in bed with my mother.
Now, this is the basic layout for Mario's Pizza.
Now, if this mechanic guy, was, in fact, eating a 5th Avenue bar, as he claims, wouldnt you agree he would have no problem picking one out from a candy line-up?
Well, he is. I, uh, I live around the corner.
Anywhere in the city - I'll tell you the best public toilet.
hey, you know what? I just remembered something. I had a dream about that guy last night. This is amazing.
Now I know what I am supposed to do. It's so simple. Tell the truth That's all. Just tell the truth
Really, I was, I was only kidding around.
(disbelief) What?! They're stealing the name?! That's my name, I made it up!
If anything happens here, can I count on you?
'The lights are much brighter there. You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares, just go...'
I dont understand why you spend time with this guy.
The guy slept with Marilyn Monroe, he's in Dinky Donuts. What about this doctor's note? Let's go see your friend Roy.
He's getting on a bus, damn! (To the blind man) Those are nice glasses.
(emerging from bathroom, buttoning his shirt) A gymnast! I can't believe it, you didn't tell me she was a gymnast.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. But then, I said to him, 'Oh yeah? Well, the jerk store called, and they're running outta you.'
The wedding is off. Now you can go to the Super Bowl.
" That guy was amazing, he could dunk and he was my height...What was his name again?"
What idea? I just said something. I didn't know you were going to listen to me.
Oh, no...no, that's very bad for the kidneys.
Ya, ya. I bumped into him on the bus. What did he have to say?
Im going to find out whats going on. All right?
(whispering) I can't explain. It's very important that I sit here.
Well, OK. As I said the guy had it in for me. He actually failed me in gym. ... ME!
All right. That's more like it. Thank you very much. (giving the sponsor the 'be strong' hand clench) By the way, my uncle was an alcoholic, so...
You know, we're living in a society! We're supposed to act in a civilized way.
I can't have an affair with a married woman, that's despicable!
I'm sorry, umm he-here's your money back (gives Rudy the money back) I-I-I'll have the clothes.
She wants to keep it quiet. She... thinks we have a real future together.
Yeah, yeah. She's seeing this guy, Art Vandelay.
Whatever. Listen, I'm very concerned about this guy.
No. No it's not. You don't know this guy. It woulda been so sweet.
That is what Mr. Steinbrenner wants. He wants, everyone, ta, twirl around.
Well, Marisa. See, the thing is... I'm sort of engaged.
Uh, anyway, (Waving bye to everyone) onward and upward.
You know what? it's better than Elaine's, too. I gotta give her a call. (Moves tward the phone)
(George puts on the headphones) Oh! my god...
(suspicious) They haven't said anything to you, have they?
You know what, bad mistake my mistake do me a favor go back to the other lane - you'll never get there - forget this lane - y'a kn ow what this lane stinks - go back to the other lane - bad decision - go go go take this light - take this light -
Alright, lets get in there. Quick, quick, quick...
I probably didn't hear it on the way over because of the street noise. (he panics) This is no good! I got to meet these guys from MacKenzie for lunch in half an hour!
(To himself) How am I gonna do this? I'm engaged to this woman? She doesn't even like me. Change the subject? Toilets were the subject. We don't even share the same interests.
(realizing he was short changed) I was in the pool! I was in the pool!
Yes. I like to feel cozy. I have a very small apartment. I like to feel tucked in, nestled in. Love to be nestled.
Anyway it's kind of a fluke thing but uh I'll be leaving for Paris in two days. I will send you a postcard when I get there.
I like to stop at the duty free shop.
(Opens the door, looks in and then knocks 5 times) Mr. Steinbrenner, (waves) can I talk to you for a second?
I love the mirror in that bathroom! I dont know what in the hell it is. I look terrific in that mirror. (George sits.) I dont know if its the tile or the lighting... I feel like Robert Wagner.
Of course. Your massage. (winks) Enjoy your massage. (winks)
Excuse me...huh... I think I made a big mistake. I'd like my deposit back please.
40? I'm payin' 60 to my maid. She doesn't do laundry and I'm gettin' nothin'. All right. Once she pinched my ass, but I don't know what that was.
OK Look, the gum isn't cutting it for me. We need to be about something else...anything..please.
Oh. Ha. They are my keys, how weird. (laughs)
Elaine, Elaine, Elaine, Elaine...(distant alarm sound which is getting louder.)
Didn't say anything. (They go into Elaine's apartment.)
No. But I was the only one at the table that didn't get violently ill.
If only she could get fired. Is there any way that could happen? I mean I know how to get myself fired.
My mother loves Hampton tomatoes. She's nuts for Hampton tomatoes.
Yes. Well -- So, uh, sit on the same side at a booth, huh?
"throws your hips off kilter" So where's your money? (pulls out his wallet)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, go. Go about your business, I'll just wander around.
(Somewhat stern) Oh, the thing's cancelled. Sit down.
Wait a minute? He's picking up the van tonight? This is perfect. I'll drive Rhisa to someplace romantic. Then when my father slides the door open, I'm in the van kissing his brother's daughter.
(from bathroom) VANDELAY, SAY VANDEL... (George falls) ... Vandelay Industries, ...
My whole life has been a complete waste of time, (chuckle)
That's what I'm afraid of. You know Mr. Steinbrenner, . . .
Really? (Realizes) Well, you don't think it had anything to do with what I said, do you?
So, if Susan and I had... I mean, if the envelopes hadn't, uh... then we--
Why'd I think it was timbre? Yeah, she could do voiceover commercials, why didn't you tell me about her voice?
Yeah, the neck hole thing, and I would appreciate it if you would say you're sorry.
Three days. Well, maybe you caught her on the cusp of a new wash cycle. You know, she did laundry the day after she met you, everything got clean and she started all over again.
You tell that son of a bitch no Yankee is ever comin' to Houston. Not as long as you bastards are running things.
I still don't understand this. Abby has a mentor?
Oh, this guy tried to sneak into my space.
So, I guess I was lucky that I never tried that myself.
This is not good. This is not good.
I'm going out with her tomorrow, she said she had some errands to run.
Well at least you accomplished something. You got fish.
This you are not going to believe. Al Netchie, that pimple. Tells Daphne, not get this 'Not to get involved with me.'
And I am not a piece of toast.
well I don't know if there's gonna be any place to eat up there
I have no power Do you understand? I need hand. I have no hand.
I mean we can put a man on the moon but we're still basically very stupid. The guy who's car this is? He could be one of the guys that built the rocket. You see what I'm saying?
Well, that's not offensive. (Reflects) It's abnormal, but it's not offensive.
Yeah. Where's he taking you, by the way?
You should be the one criticizing me. I, I'm lucky to even know someone like you.
Sir, I just got a call from the terrorist. I told him to call back here.
He never finished the sentence. He got a call, that was the end of the interview.
Then afterwards maybe we could all go out together. Y'know she'll see me with my friends, she'll observe me as I really am, as myself. Maybe I can get some hand that way.
Hey, don't embarrass me today. I got some friends in the stands. (George makes a swinging motion with an imaginary bat and pulls something in his back.)
Of course hes been in touch with him. Hes left two messages. He just hasnt heard back yet, thats all.
(Outraged. Leaving) Well, you just lost a lot of business! Because I love to read!
How could you be a doctor and not say "get outta here"? It should be part of the training at medical school "Cancer? Get outta here!" "Go home! What are you crazy? It's a little test. It's nothing. You're a real nut. You know that?" (Jerry gives him half of his sandwich to hopefully shut him up) I told you that God would never let me be successful. I never should've written that pilot. Now the show will be a big hit, we'll make millions of dollars, and I'll be dead. Dead Jerry. Because of this. (showing his lip)
You know, Jason, I, uh, I couldn't help notice, I... I didn't get my apology.
Oh, its a lovely song. (singing) How do you solve a problem like Maria?...
(singing) Oh hey, if you happen to see the most beautiful girl who walked out on me. Tell her I'm sorry. Tell her I need my baby ... oh won't you tell her ... I love her. Oh hey, ...
Ah, you still going on in front of Bania, eh?
I got to give the players most of the credit for that.
This is totally different! That was my secret, this is Jerry's secret! There's...there's attorney-client priveleges here! If I play it by your rule, no one'll ever confide in me again, I'll be cut out of the loop!
I calculated my odds of ever getting together with a Portuguese waitress. Mathematically, I had to do it, Jerry.
To do what?! Work in a post office? Is that what you want me to do?
(pointedly to Elaine) Oh. Thanks very much for yesterday, by the way.
This is very exciting! You're on the Tonight Show, NBC, who else is on the show?
You can't break up with me. I've got hand.
Howbout Kramer or Elaine, they don't want them?
Jerry? I have to tell you something. This is the dullest moment Ive ever experienced.
How so? I'll tell you how so. She's bald!
I don't know how a fish could eat laughs.
(surprising his parents in the kitchen) Welcome back.
Well, it's the damnedest thing. The cat dies. So she comes back into town, she finds the cat lying on the carpet stiff as a board.
No good? All right, uh how about Art... Cor.....
We're on the Grand Central, there's no traffic.
I'm going straight to hell, no two ways about it.
(to Elaine) Right, alright. (to Jerry) Oh Jerry, do you have any apples?
(pointing to Jerry in joyous agreement) Ha-ha-hah. This is my lucky day.
I cant believe I said that. You know me, Im a vault.
I have an aunt that died at seven.
(Asking Elaine) Jerry seem a little weird when I mentioned Nina?
(to Jerry) How could we not hear anything? What's with this Russel? What's he doing? (Jerry raises his arms and shoulders like he doesn't know)
Would you stop that? It's not safe to be jumping up and down on a plane.
You go in the living room. I'll take the test in here.
And she'll still see it, you're not stopping her from seeing it.
No..hummm, What do you know about what you look like.
(talking to nobody) I like horses. Maybe I could be a stable boy.
I know. This was like a record. My previous record was when Joni Hirsch asked me not to tell anybody that we slept together. Kept a lid on that for about 28 seconds.
Oh, my god that's Saddam Hussein. The dictator.
So what, what is so bad about that?
What big salad? I'm going to the coffee shop.
(Holding camera) Look at this, I only have one picture left... How 'bout a shot of me and Mr. Morgan?
But it's not a photograph, I need a photograph!
Only I hold the answer key to their true candy identities. And so, without further ado, I give you the candy line-up. (Opens a door to a back room. Various dealership employees are munching on candy bars)
(standing up, still acting) Uhh! I'm caught in my own web of lies! (holds his hands up in surrender)
Yes! I mean, if she thinks that's me she's under a complete misapprehension. That was not me, Jerry. That was not me.
Alright, alright, but no funny business, same deal as last night.
Alright, well you know what'cha gotta do, you gotta go through her purse. Y'know, the-the credit cards, driver's license...
It would have been nice if someone told me about it. I just think you could have said something. That's all.
Kramer, this is perfect. I need you to go in there, pretend you're a doctor and check this guy for moles.
Would I want to see what Mary Todd wore to Lincoln's funeral?
Okay, so you remember I made the initial call Sunday, she doesnt call back. I call again Monday, I leave another message. I call Tuesday, I get the machine again, I know youre there, I dont know what your story is. Yesterday, Im a volcano  I try one more call, the machine comes on, and I let fly like Mussolini from the balcony, Where the hell do you get the nerve? You invite me up for coffee and then you dont call me back for four days? I dont like coffee, I dont have to come up. Id like to get one more shot at the coffee just so I could spit it in your face.
Hey, I've eaten frogs, so nobody's perfect. Anyway-
Thank you very much. You just stand over there, I?ll stand over here.
I bought a new recliner with a fridge build right in to it.
I dont know. But Simons said that if I wanted to get involved, that Wilkinson would tell me the exact right minute to sell. You wanna do it?
It's two completely different sounds. "ih" and "eh".
You see? Now that is a handsome man. (Elaine and Jerry look right at George) Oh please.
What, you think I eat all my meals with you? (To waitress) Excuse me, sweetheart? I think you may have overcharged us. What is this?
I eh, I had a sandwich in my pocket.
This is my ketchup. I bought this ketchup just so I could have as much as I want.
(oozing fake sincerity) Well, as much as I enjoy all the good-natured ribbing, nothing really makes me happier than spending money on the people I care about.
W--then I'm pretty much where I am now. At least I got to take a ride on a spaceship.
(animated) Some guy. Some guy? Neil! I have got to find out how he could get a girl like Danielle.
For a mental patient. Wait a minute, the phone, we'll call the police.
Huh. (Makes a "over his head" gesture with his arm) C'mon, let's go, go. We got a lot of work to do today.
Just dropped in for a visit. You, uh, you never called me back.
I feel terrible, I can't be responsible for breaking up a marriage. Oh no (starting moving for the door, Elaine begins to stop him)
I had to give it to the liquor store guy.
I'd argue if I could, Mrs. Enright. (exits) Here we go, all right.
??? KNOCK OFFS. I NOT GOING TO DO IT! AND YOU'RE GOING TO CALL STEINBRENNER BACK AND CANCEL THE WHOLE THING.
Well, whoever he was, he knew a lot about The A-Team!
(sitting) Newww tuxedo. For the Pinstripe Ball. Steinbrenner is throwing a huge party at Tavern on the Green, heh!
(Relieved) I haven't? I'm okay? I'm okay? Oh, thank you, thank you, Doctor! I don't know how to thank you.
(quietly) ehh. (pausing to look at both of them) So what made you change your mind?
Well, I'm sure they'll be able to fix it. You can't stop modern science. Can't stop it, you can't stop it. Can't stop science. Can't be stopped, no way, no how, science just marches--
I'm telling you, that cashier is riding horses on my money.
Say you, me, and Kramer are, uh, flying over the Andes.
This is our new Vice-president of Acquisitions, sir.
Who am I going to tell? My mother? Like I've got nothing better to talk about.
Oh, well, so what? Laughter - what is that? I mean, what is the point of opening your mouth and going "Ha, ha!"? What is that? "Ha, ha!"?
Hey, hey hey. Don't worry about me. I'm not a waffler. I don't waffle!
I got me an appointment with a hardware store. I'm not saying I want to do it for the rest of my life, but, uh, hardware fascinates me. Don't you love to make a key?
(Not amused with her answer) Eggs are eggs. That is very profound. (laughs; Daphne goes back to reading her paper) By the same token you could say fish is fish. Ha ha ha, I don't think so. (pauses) Listen Dophne
You know, it's very impolite to tell secrets. Are you talking about me?
Ripe. Boy, this Joe's got some terrific fruit.
Thank you for leaving me alone with him!
Well, he said it could be cancer, maybe you should get it checked out.
I know. I can tell. It's one of my powers. Why, did you ever fake?
No, no, I mean, driving Susan to lesbianism.
It's really nothing, it's like going to the dentist.
I don't believe it, what did you say?
So... here I am. Ready to take you to the Hamptons.
(frustrated) Fine. Fine. (to customer) Excuse me. (heading for the door) Think I'm gonna forget about this? I haven't forgotten about this. I don't forget that easily!
I knew this was gonna happen some day. It was inevitable. I've known it ever since I was a little kid. I've been waiting for it.
Well if she can't tell "six" from "sex" then how is she going to lip read from across the room?
No, no, this wasn't moving on. I got the hook. I wish I could get a lesson in that.
O.k....(is about to explain. Cut to Jerry on-stage.)
(quiet, desperate) Maybe she can get me another picture of man-hands. (calling) Elaine!
But I asked you before if you had a ticket, and you said no!
This is what they would do in the movies! It's a beautiful thing! It's like a movie! I'm gonna slip him a mickey!
I look like me and I'm working from the outside. Who do you think is in the better position?
You disappoint me, my friend. Sandy wants nothing to do with you. She tells Laura, "If you want to waste your time with that pervert, that's your problem."
Well, I still don't know what I'm supposed to do. I don't even know what my assignment is.
Ah, listen ah, I don't mean to bother you but ah, silly me, I- I think I may have left my hat in your apartment. So ah, I thought I'd just come by later and pick it up.
So you're buying the car back for your parents?
I'm wearin' a little hat, I'm jumpin' through fire.. They're puttin' their little alien heads in my mouth..
Kramer goes to a fantasy camp. His whole life is a fantasy camp. People should plunk down two-thousand dollars to live like him for a week. Do nothing, fall ass-backwards into money, mooch food off your neighbors and have sex without dating; that's a fantasy camp.
Okay, what about a nice frame? With a picture of another guy in it. Frame says I care for you, but if you wanna get serious, perhaps you'd be interested in someone like this.
I suppose he could swivel. Hey maybe one of those director's chairs. What do you think of those.
...So, anyway, if you think about it, manure is not really that bad a word. I mean, it's 'newer', which is good, and a 'ma' in front of it, which is also good. Ma-newer , right?
I'm just happy to be working with your talented son...
I don't need any ideas. It's a show about nothing.
You know, about how when you break it down, it's really a very positive thing. you know, you have a nure, with a ma in front of it. MA-NURE. Iz not bad.
(in the threshold between the living room and the kitchen) The thing that bothers me the most, is the lying.
So, you didn't think this was a date?
Listen, sweetheart, let me tell you a little something about guts. (Points to his head.) This is guts.
Well, Jerry's car gets hit and the other driver doesn't have any insurance, so the judge
Oh, I was trying to make a point.
There's elevators all over! It all looks the same.
Jerry, would you do me a favor, close the window.
You know what I was just thinking -- she could really use a raise.
Hey! Did 'ya ever do that thing on the toes that I said .
And you met her in an antique store! I don't know how you do it!
(Heavily sarcastic. He's angered at Jerry) Good one. Very funny. You're very funny, Jerry. That's what I always tell people. (Yelling out) Jerry Seinfeld's a funny guy!
Because, I've got the coat. I can sit in the car and not get cold.
The, uh, actor that played Jesus made some odd choices.
Oh my God! (coming out of bathroom) You know what I just realized?! If they get divorced an' live in two separate places? That's twice as many visits!
Well, I, I got the pilot of the Jerry show.
What are you? A *baby*!? All right. Tell her.
I walked in, your lobby door is broken again.
Well, cause we were just saying we were going to ask you to come up to the country with us this weekend. Susan's father has a cabin up there. But, eh, all right, well.
All right. There's nothing to be worried about. She's just a little annoyed right now. Tomorrow I'll personally go over there. I'll apologize. I'll get the papers. Don't worry. Don't worry. (exits)
How could anybody be so selfish and inconsiderate!
I...I...write a letter and then I..I go to China. I disappear in a sea of people for like six months, a year you know just while things simmer down. Ehm.. Ehm...Dear Susan. I'm sorry. I made a terrible mistake. I'm really , really sorry.
There was an incident. I'd rather not discuss it.
(Impersonating Carson) I didn't not know that. Weird. Wild. (Susan and George both laugh)
(Sarcastically) What's the competition, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang?
She um, she wants to see The Muted Heart.
Yeah, hell be looking at us like hes backstage at a puppet show.
What are you comparing yourself to Keith Hernandez. The guys a baseball player Jerry, Baseball!
Well, I just had a fight - I need a group dynamic.
Forget it? I already called my parents. I told them to expect the surprise of a lifetime. My mothers making her roasted potatoes!
Right. I mean, we're on a subject. Why does it have to be changed?
(singing)  Master of the house/Keeper of the inn... (Jerry re-enters the living room and modestly models his new jacket for George. George is impressed.) This is huge! When did this happen?
Oh, what's the point? When I like them, they don't like me, when they like me, I don't like them. Why can't I act with the ones I like the same way I do with the ones I don't like?
Look, I am under direct orders from Mr Wilhelm. So if you have a problem with that, maybe you should just take it up with him.
Told me to "Go to hell!" and I took the bus home.
When I asked him if it was cancer, he didn't give me a "get outta here". That's what I wanted to hear "Cancer? Get outta here?"
Oh I got it. (TO JERRY) That I'm supposed to remember. Where the car is, that's insignificant.
I dont know why you even bother with this ping pong guy, Ill tell you that.
Oh, I was uh, I was waiting downstairs for the jackhammer, thought I'd drop by.
I'm cheap? You think I'm CHEAP? How could you say that to me? I can't believe this. How could you say that to me?
All right, I gotta make a call. Everybody out, come on.
(he makes a sign to Jodi to wait and turns to Jerry) Jerry... This woman hates me so much. I'm starting to like her.
It was very traumatic. The last thing I remember is you flinching. Then, everything went black.
(grabbing the sweater back) Well it's not really damaged. 85 dollars huh?
(removing his glasses) You know, Hawaii could be a little tricky right now, there's a lot of high pressure winds down there this time of year, there's a lot of debris constantly flying around. Wood, and uh, lava, pretty dangerous.
Yeah, the tenant association has decided to hear my side of the story. So, uh, I gotta kinda get ready. I'll see ya.
Here's the TV. I know you wanted to watch the Super Bowl. Do you at least have some towels we could sit on? It's, like, a four hour game.
(to Mickey) Can't you just switch with another Midget?
(takes a bite) Oh, that's good. That's very good.
Yeah, when the season starts. Right now, I sit around pretending that I'm busy.
(incredulous) You can't ground me, I'm a grown man.
I got engaged. I'm getting married. I asked Susan to marry me. We're getting married this Christmas.
(Concerned) Why're you doing this, Jerry? Is it your career? Things will pick up.
Dad, it's me. Hey, listen, I was at Fortunoff's the other day, and, you know what, you were right.
(To Rachel) And, uh, you eat eggs, right?
Well, after dinner last week, she invites me back to her apartment.
No, no. I-I just want us to be... together.
You know, I have to tell you something. You couldn't get me on a plane right now. I get those FAA reports directly. My uncle sends them to me, he used to be a pilot, so. Big investigation in the, uh, what's the word there, uh, offing. It's in the offing. But, you know, you shouldn't let that stop you from going. You could go. I don't mind.
Aw, that's a fun age. (Jerry looks at George distastefully.)
They would never tell me, Elaine. First of all, they probably think that I killed Susan. Besides, I don't even think they like me. (Jerry comes over to the table.)
Shouldn't we at least drop off your bag?
I got a message from the Rosses at work today.
Yeah, I told her how toilet paper hasn't changed in my lifetime, and probably wouldn't change in the next fifty thousand years and she was fascinated, fascinated!
Fifty bucks a month, that's incredible! Okay, thanks.
(chuckles) Bye, thanks. (To Jerry, when Susan is far) I can't believe she took the money.
Yeah, and she's going to find I'm a moron. You know, people think I'm smart, but I'm not smart.
Pst. (moves in close with Elaine and Jerry) Wilkinsons got a bite on a new one. Petramco Corp. Out of, uh Springfield. I think. Theyre about to introduce some sort of a robot butcher.
All right. I am happy, and I'll tell ya why -- because the two of you were making me and every one of your friends sick! Right, Elaine?
(smiling) Uh, hi. Uhm, remember me? I..I'm the guy who looks like Neil?
There he is. Right on time as usual.
Hey! (to Elaine, who doesn't look too cheerful)
I'm not going to see that nut doctor she went to Europe with.
Wait a minute, you were at a funeral, right?
(singing) Lemon tree, very pretty and a lemon flower...
I do too. you see that's what we're about . You don't remind me of anyone and we love gum.
No, no, he mimed it. That's what was so funny about it.
Well, I wish I could say the same, but I must say, with all due respect, I find it very hard to see the logic behind some of the moves you have made with this fine organization. In the past twenty years you have caused myself, and the city of New York, a good deal of distress, as we have watched you take our beloved Yankees and reduced them to a laughing stock, all for the glorification of your massive ego!
(knocks on the window) Hey, why are all those people milling around my car?
[to himself] Hey, whatd'ya know? Look at that! A *lesbian* sighting. Oh-ho! My lucky day. They're *so* fascinating. Why is that? Because they don't want us. You gotta respect that...
Every day she comes in, she sits at that table and reads. Never talks to anybody.
I kept looking at her face. Id go, Cmon, love her. Love her!
Anyway, right in the middle, the ship blows up-- burning debris, bodies falling-- and then just as this eerie silence settles over the airfield, I yelled out, "That's gotta hurt!"
Going backstage is the worst. Especially when they stink. You know that's a real problem.
I always get myself in this position. Can't be on time. Gotta rush.
Yeah. Steinbrenner wants everyone in the front office to give a lecture in their area of business expertise.
My place? NO, no, no. I hate my place. I don't wanna go back to my place.
A different name for the butler? (Russell throws up again.)
You just gave them to him two days ago, he's gotta give you a grace period.
Yeah, right. I'll just go up and say, "Hi, how ya' doing? Would you like a glass of white wine?" JERRY Before you got within twenty feet of this woman, she'd have her finger on the mace button. She's like an expensive car with one of those motion-sensor force field alarms. Any sudden movement in the area could set her off.
I find the soothing pastorial images very conduc-
Care? Forget about care. Love. They have to love the characters. Otherwise, why would they keep tuning in?
No problem. There's no problem. She just owes me ten dollars, that's all.
She told me she wants-- (Pauses until a woman coming down the stairs passes) She told me she wants me to make love to her.
(on phone) . It's George Costanza. . are there any messages for me? Why does Mr. Steinbrenner want to see me in his office? . . . Communist? I'm not a Communist . . . . All right, all right. All right, I'll be there. - ( hangs up ) My secretary Ada, told Mr Steinbrenner I'm a Communist Now he wants to see me in his office.
(to Jay) What do you think it is?
You're right. Why must there always be a problem? You'd think just once I could get a break. God knows I earned it with that score!
You be nice! He's giving me a parking space (echoes) parking space... parking space...
I don't know. He said he wants to be my "key brother."
That's right. He just happened to be the previous owner of the vehicle.
I'm George. George Costanza, you live around here?
She made a big breakfast every Sunday. I don't know what she put in those eggs.
(Frantic) Kramer, do you know what those guys are gonna do to me?!
The truth. you want the truth? It is your earrings It is the chopsticks but it's so much more. You're pretentious. You call everyone by their full name You call my doorman, Sammy, "Samuel" but you didn't even say "Samuel" You went "Sam - U- EL" Papie-eh Mach-eh What is Papie-ay Mach-ay?
I snapped! It was the last straw. (sighs)
No, I'm gonna hold it under her nose so she can smell the scent of stale Bosco that I had to live with for three years, and I'm gonna say, "Remember this shirt, baby?! Well, now, it's payback time!"
And ah, Ill have the bacon club without the turkey. (raises eyebrows)
All you got is instant coffee? Why don't you get some real coffee?
Maybe somebody did it and didn't take credit for it. Maybe it was already done and didn't need doing in the first place. I have no idea who did it, what they did, or how they did it so well. And you know what? Jimmy crack corn and I don't care.
Yeah! That's how they talk. You know, everyone's either a bastard or a son of a bitch. Yeah, it's like uh..."boy, that son of a bitch Box can really hit, uh?!" (laughs)
Very exciting, very exciting, it's like watching a birth.
I'll make time, because Abby, I was once like you; wide-eyed, naive, I didn't know the first thing about a subject as fundamental as risk management.
You already have an in. You have the same first name!... (no reaction) 'Jerry'!
No one gives us the finger! We're Yankees!
Yup, y'know, they really spruce up the apartment.
Uh, we're cool. Everything's cool (to security attendent)
Well this worked out okay. So are you going to see the police woman?
...you'll see, things will be different now - if you just give me one more chance.
Yeah, about ten, fifteen minutes. But I have to stop at a vegetable stand.
So the Wig master.......the Wig master said you could stop by the theater tonight.. and he'll show you around.
Eh...come oooon...(starts stabbing the paper with the pen. Mr. Wilhelm comes in)
I like this area. I could live out here.
Lo..k, if you want to taste mine, you don't have to offer me some of yours.
I know who it was too. It was the guy who interviewed me. He was very threatened by me. Why else wouldn't he hire me? I could sell latex like that (snaps fingers).
I'm interviewing all these annoying little overachievers.. finally, this kid walks in - Steven Koren - a regular guy.. likes sports.. watches T.V..
I was trying to stick the landing. (indistinct) ...was right around here.
(improvising) My uh uncle is having an operation. I just wanted to see how he was.
(inhales deeply) I tell you, Jerry, I'm feeling something. Something I haven't felt in a long time.
(explaining, with lots of hand gestures) Okay, look. We've never worked together on a lie. Now, you don't understand how I work. I have a certain way of working. Jerry and I have worked together a few times. He knows how I work. It's not a personal thing, y'know? We're just trying to come up with the best possible lie. That's what this is all about.
I have a point, I have a point.
Oh, that's too bad. I kinda wanted to meet him, seeing as how we look so similar.
Oh...(is about to tell Jerry, but reconsiders) ...clothing, something, I dunno. So, uh, what are you doing today?
Yeah. Yeah. With all that kissing and the shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy out in public like that. It's disgusting!
I can't believe you called me a chucker. No way I'm a chucker, I do not chuck, never chucked, never have chucked, never will chuck, no chuck!
I'm sure we're all aware of the flaws and biases of standardized tests..
You're luscious. You're ravishing. I would give up red meat just to get a glimpse of you in a bra. Im terribly sorry. (both George and the attractive female applicant stand up as George reaches across the desk and shakes her hand for coming in)
All right. You wanna know what one of her favorite expressions is? Happy, Pappy?
Aw, Mr. Kruger, Sir. Merry Christmas! (Hands him a card)
You got bit by a strange dog and you didn't get a rabies shot?
U-ok. (George closes the window and shoos Elaine off. He opens the door to Monica.) Here you go.
Just tell her whatcha want, they'll make it for ya.
Didja see the way she was looking at me?
You're in the movie? Is he in the scene?
Yup. It's really just a question of what kind. Thinking about a bar stool.
I don't understand. They're supposed to be casting this week. Something's wrong. Maybe they're not doing it.
All right, let me ask you something When do you start to worry about ear hair?
So, where you gonna stick this (points to the Fusilli Jerry)
Ow! What are you doing under there? Hey, stop that! Don't eat that! That's not food! (to Robin) He's suckin' down Equal packets!
My father wears his sneakers in the pool! Sneakers!
Cut it. (goes back to the group) (Yelling) Would you stop signing?
Well, she's smart. You take my word for it.
Now if I wanna see anything I gotta wear these.
You know what? I think this Ruthie Cohen gave me the wrong change. Didn't I pay with a twenty? I'm sure I paid with a twenty.
(spotting possible salvation) You know what, I urge you to take it up with him. Go ahead, give him a call, he'll tell you what I'm doing here. (half to himself) Then you can tell me.
I, I really should go home. Ya.. actually I'm planning on spending the day with my father tomorrow (short laugh) we're uh we're going to a father-son picnic, just the two of us.
I was going to, but then I found out that the auto club has this free locksmith service, so I signed up. Just waiting for the membership to kick in.
That's right, who the hell are they? How dare they?!
Fine. (hits his arm on the desk) Ow!
Pulp can move, Baby! Why didn't you eat a real breakfast?
(spits out mouthful of food) Mrs. Enright! Mrs. Enright!
I don't even like to sit next to a man on an airplane 'cause our knees might touch.
We just go up to him, we say, "We're O'Brien."
I don't even know Peterman. How the hell am I gonna relax? I'm gonna have to be on all night. I don't like being on, Jerry, I would much rather be off.
Baah! There it is! You just said it! That's what I want! Now say it again, and tell it to me.
I mean it's gotten to the point where I'm flirting with operators on the phone. I almost made a date with one.
When are they gonna have the flying cars, already?
I know it may sound shocking. But, I just can't stop myself from... wanting you.
So, she went out with you on a first date.. and it was her birthday?
Well I'm very excited about this. I've always wanted to see how those sketch artists do it.
(to Jerry) What do you mean by that?
Well, I started to tell her and then all of the sudden, for some reason, I just burst into tears.
Jerry, I can't. It's like saying to Pavorotti, "Teach me to sing like you."
I gotta go help her tape up all his boxes and get them ready for shipping.
Yes a cruise, a long cruise, just the two of you.
Of course you do... It's just, uh, y'know, I-I never *knew*, uh, that, uh...
I have never seen a Mohel like that.
Jerry please, that's very nice, but, uh, (closes the door) where would we be going?
Uh, excuse me, Wyck. Uh, are we, uh, almost done here?
I mean it's hard enough to meet a woman you dislike, much less like.
Give me your key, I gotta get it.
Sure. Thank you for coming in. (Tom eats some raisins)
What're you doing? What're you, telling secrets? What're you laughing at?
Stop it, stop it! It's not fair. It's not fair. I don't like this situation, Jerry. I don't like it one bit.
What I don't get is, just because the battery is dead, you think she'd be able to roll up the hill with her hands!
Yes, I, uh, I need to return this book.
There you go, okay? That's my *other* friend's ticket. You happy now? You got two tickets.
Can I come upstairs, please? (Elaine pushes the button and lets George in.)
(trying to laugh it off) No, I was just wondering. The information could be relevant.
Ponce de Leon? Okay. (to Jerry) You sure you don't wanna go?
(Chuckling) yeah. Uh, oh, here's your sunglasses. (Hands them to her)
Maybe we could call them and ask them to return it.
Yeah. Not only that, this is what she said to me, "Can we change the subject?"
She dragged me down to that warehouse on the waterfront in Brooklin to see one of her "performances".
You know, I can't remember the last time I called a woman without being nervous. I, usually, I'm pacing all over the room, I'm...
(Runs over to him, not wanting him to leave) What? You're going?
How could that piece of *crap* cost $98.00!?
I just wanted to talk to him for a minute, but Ill come back.
You're not letting him win. He wins till you're forty.
I told them to meet me in front of my building at six-fifteen.
Ohh.. Paco! (Flicks rubber band tward the kitchen) Hey, take a look at this. (Hands Jerry Kruger's check)
Ya know, I was just a little surprised.
(astounded) What? So, this is still not over?
I think Play Now is putting something in my food.
Look, why couldn't you make me an architect? You know I always wanted to pretend that I was an architect. Well I-I'm supposed to see her tomorrow, I-I-I'm gonna tell her what's goin on. I mean maybe she just likes me for me.
(Laughs) Relationship intern...hey, what if two of us teamed up?
And a guy will appear from out of nowhere. I say "Get out of here! What do you want? You don't belong here!"
What did you go out with me for?! Just to dump chocolate on my shirt and then just dump me altogether?! I don't deserve that kind of treatment! What, you don't have the common courtesy to return my calls?! To apologize! You think I'm some sort of a loser, that likes to be abused and ignored?! Who's shirt can be ruined without financial restitution?! Some sort of a masochist who enjoys being humiliated? You think you can avoid me like I have some sort of disease?! You have the disease! You have the disease! You may be beautiful and rich and physically .. just .. unbelievable, but you sicken me! You disgust me! You and everyone like you!
(taking the phone from Elaine) Jerry, why is Elaine getting your mail?
How much tip do you leave on $8.15?
Oh, oh. Uh, you know. It's the damndest thing. I, uh, I moved recently and my files, pfff, disappeared. Now, I-I don't know if they fell off the truck or if there was some sort of foul play but let me tell you something. I'm not through with that moving company.
You can see the Cayman Islands in there? Is something going to happen to me? What?
Listen, maybe we shouldn't start writing today. I got a lot on my mind.
Besides, Steven Koren has the highest of aspirations. He wants to be (pauses for effect) an architect.
Im the judge and the jury, pal. And the verdict is guilty!
I'm very disappointed to here you talk like that. You still don't know what makes me tick.
Hehe. Well, I got my triangles. (sitting on the couch)
So, how come nothing ever happened between you and Nina? (Getting paranoid) Is there a problem with her? Is she a man?
No, she left. Listen, you can't mention any of this to Elaine. Cynthia will kill me, we made a deal.
Huh. Excuse me (to Ping) Hum... Do you speak chinese?
Jerry, I felt like a straight man in some horrible sketch. He was riffing! Riffing! On my pain!
Don't look around. Don't look around. That's what he wants.
I don't understand, how do these thieves start the car?
No, stings the throat. Anyway, so I was coming along here, and I felt like a piece of cake, you know? But then I thought, it's morning, I should really have a muffin. I like those chocolate chip ones. Then I figured, well, they're really both cake. So I, uh, I sat on that bench for a little while, twenty minutes or an hour, and then I figured, check and see what you were up to. (a thought occurs to him) Wait a minute, wait a minute. The broad jump! The broad jump over the pothole on Eighty-sixth Street!
And I always take care of my Pisano's. So here is a little something. (drop in tip and worker looks the other way, so George decides to take it out and try again only to get caught)
I cant do it. Ill, Ill keep her busy.
Step-skipper. That man is a step-skipper! He skips Step Nine!
(still quiet) Think, a second. You know, your friend was talking about me and, you know...
I love when they touch your arm. I can't get enough of that. Why is that?
Ill tell her I bumped into you, Im giving you a ride uptown.
Well I can't now, Gwen's going to be there.
"I have to go see Steinbrenner later. Mr Wilhelm told him that I was the one responsable for stealing all the merchandise."
I won fifty bucks! Boy, this is great. Too bad Elaine's not here.
I know what the problem is - I like her too much. That's why I can't make a move.
Jerry, it's fantastic. I love the people over there. They- they treat me so great. You know they think I'm handicapped, they gave me this incredible office, a great view.
(Takes it and throws it out window) Get outta my way!
I know, they're out of their minds! It's fantastic!
If you had like five chickens could you tell them apart by just the way they acted? Or would they all just be walking around? Bak, bak, baak, bak? Cause if they have individual personalities Im not sure we should be eaten `em. What's the matter with you?
This is all too much. So what are you feeling? What's going on? Are you like a couple again now?
Yeah, it's being framed right now. I don't even know what it costs. (beat) Not, uh, too expensive, is it?
This is what my life has come to... Tryin to meet a mute.
Not necessarily. Mustard lends itself to the squeeze.
Ya and also I'm afraid that people in that state are finally going to tell me what they really think of me. You know they got nothing to lose what do they care?
All right. Well, we'll see what happens to you.
All right, I'll tell you what... why don't you go into the store and I'll wait in the car?
Me? No, no, I don't, I don't. Doing very well, very well, yep.
Can I ask you a question? Would you mind switching seats?
Well, they gave birth to me, and, yada yada...
No I can't. I can't die with dignity. I have no dignity. I want to be the one person who doesn't die with dignity. I live my whole life in shame. Why should I die with dignity?
That damn delicatessen that - that is last time they screw up one of my orders.
Let's test him. Hey, driver. What do you say we stop off, pick up your sister, have a little fun back here? No, he can't hear us.
So I set up a screening, everyone takes their shirt off and click, I snap me a shot of a bear-chested Kruger.
(to Jerry) Have you seen the waitresses in there lately? I never had so much coffee in my life.
(panicky) What are you gonna do? Are you gonna call the police?
I was squinting! Remember that drive from Wortsborough? (snapping his fingers) I was spotting those raccoons.
Ha! Ha! Hey! (moving his arms like it's so great to be all here)
Of course, I'm the result of my parents having stayed together, so you never know. (Russell comes out of the bathroom.)
I'm sorry - I have to say, I'm a little disappointed, I thought it would be a lot nicer.
I mean, I could understand if there was something else playing, but it's this or nothing.
I think I'll have a piece of cake.
And, Ill have a club soda with no ice.
No, listen; we are always sitting here, I am always helping you with your girl problems and you are helping me with my girl problems. Where do we end up?
(Laughs, snorts) I said, I said 'Get outta here! No story? Is that what I said?'
It's stuck on a piece of cloth here. I can't get the cloth out.
Well, I don't see how I'm gonna make December. I mean, I need a little more time. I mean, look at me I'm a nervous wreck. My stomach aches. My neck is killing me. I can't turn. Look. Look.
Divorce is very difficult. Especially on a kid.
I cant believe- (falls on his knees) WE ALREADY DISCUSSED THIS!
I tried to be nice. I wasn't nice?
(in his mind) I think that ginger ale at the coffee shop is just Coke and Sprite mixed together. How can I prove it? Ah! Can't, dammit. (knock at door. George goes to open it)
It never ends, this present stuff! Engagement present! Then they get married, you gonna have to get them something for that! Then the baby, there's another present. Then the baby starts getting their presents. I don't even like Drake.
Well, as I say, the pink-eye made my vision...quite blurry... (Joe's daughter comes to the door.)
Of course I'm not Cartwright! Look, why don't you two just go to the movies all by yourselves, I'm not in the mood.
Yes, it is exciting! All right, this is gonna be my new face.
Oh, the busboy left the menu a little close to the candle.
You met her a few weeks ago, but...?
Somebody double parked and blocked us in. D-DOES ANYBODY KNOW WHOSE CAR THAT IS? Maybe there's a note on it. Ohh-oh brother. No, no note. Can you believe this?
Great move, telling him, by the way, real smart move.
(he walks casually to Tom, and taps his arm) Listen. I know we've had our problems in the past, but we got a show to do tonight. Time to pull together as a team. Life's too short. I say, let's let bygones be bygones. If you took the raisins, if you didn't take the raisins-- They weren't even my raisins. I was just curious because it seems like a strange to do to walk into a room, audition, and to walk out with a box of raisins. Anyway, whatever. If you ever want to tell me about it, the door to my office is always opened. In the event that I get an office. You'll come in, we'll talk about the raisins. We'll have a nice laugh.
It's my name. I made it up. You can't just steal it.
No, no, no we'll talk about it later.
Oh...uh, because if it had anything at all to do with what you perceived as me leering at your daughter, I really have to take issue with that. I did not leer. (To Jerry) Did I leer?
Excuse me, I'm sorry to bother you, I noticed that you have a textbook on tape. May I ask where you got that?
Is that the guy who likes fat women?
Oh I'm going baby! I'm going! (he leaves)
What, are you crazy? I can't have a man touching me. Switch with me.
Aw c'mon. It's a fantastic name. It's a real original, nobody else is gonna have it and I absolutely love it.
It's that bleak? (pours a glass of milk)
You know it must be impossible for a Spanish person to order seltzer and not get salsa. (Angry) "I wanted seltzer, not salsa."
(pops his head out of the covers, looking a bit confused) Uh...you know, uh...pleasuring you.
Well, people never give a good 'hello' at a funeral. I mean, they go like this (George gives an extremely understated nod) That's the biggest.
(angry that she believes Al was right) No he's not right. Al Netchie is not right! Alright I'm canceling the father-son picnic. I don't know what he's gonna do with all that potato salad.
How can you call yourself a clown and not know who Bozo is?
I-I just don't react well to these situations. My grandmother died two months early because of the way I reacted in the hospital. She was getting' better. And then I went to pay her a visit. She saw my face. BOOM. That was the end of it.
It's a foreign movie... a *film*, is what it is, actually.
No, occasionally I'll forget to let the machine pick up. Anyway, they made this large donation, to a women's prison, and I get to go down there and check it out.
I said preferably cashmere, for warmth. So in front of the whole party, he says, 'No. I don't want you stretching out the neck hole.'
Now my parents are gonna know I had people over.
I gotta stay one step ahead of Neil.
I mean, it's not fair. I've been going there for 7 years. She's been there 3 weeks.
Payroll project. Wilhelm? Big uh, big payroll project.
I had a little tiff with Bonnie about the roommate.
