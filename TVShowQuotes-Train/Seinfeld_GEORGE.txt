What are they doin' lettin' you bastards on an airplane? Don't they know that's against FAA regulation?
Uh Jerry, how long will you be in there?
It'll be different this time.
Hmm, what's he doin' in the city today?
Likewise.
Well, I guess I'm getting older.
What are you? Satan? I'm close to a job here. It's my second interview with them.
Nothing.
Kramer, I can't help you. You're gonna have to get them some place else.
Alright, c'mon, scooch over. (Tries to squeeze into the corner seat of the couch and struggles with Remy. He spills his glass of grape juice all over the couch in the process.)
How could you not know who Bozo the Clown is?
Anyway, so he gave me his spare keys, now he wants to have my keys, so I need mine back from you.
Those birthdays. I told you. They're relationship killers. If a relationship is having any problems whatsoever, a birthday will always bring it out.
I'm against all "it's me"s. So self-absorbed and egotistical, it's like those hip musicians with their complicated shoes!
85, Jerry! 85 IQ !
(rage) Oh, it's got cachet, baby! It's got cachet up the yin-yang!
A-ha, huh. (mumbles) tours.
All right. Don't change me. Susan. Don't change me. Ya know there are a lot of woman that would love to be in your position right now.
Twix.. (Makes various noises) B-5.
What about that spot I got?
What I said? I say stupid things all the time I can't go two minutes without saying stupid things.
No. Now I'll always have this doubt about the car. What, your jaw still hurts?
I want to know how did that get into my car?
Ahh, Steinbrenner gave 'em to us, in honour of Phil Rizzuto being inducted into the Hall of Fame.
Umm... No.
Mister Fowler, I-I have a squirrel here that is a miracle of modern science! (laughs)
No, not a racial thing, there really is a resemblance...
Oh-ohf (snorts) yeah, I'm a writer. (laughs)
(wry) He knows.
No, no, this wasn't moving on. I got the hook. I wish I could get a lesson in that.
Don't you see. Women like that are like, members of a secret tribe living in a forbidden city. People like me have not been inside in thousands of years.. But with this, it's like I've already been with one of her own! My hands been stamped! I come and go as I please!
Sure, Guatamala...
So I lugged that table. That big heavy massage table all the way down to the cab! You ever seen one of those things?
You know, the guy from Cheers.
Of course I'm back. Why wouldn't I be back? My mother's in the hospital, I'm going to pay her a visit.
Oh, I, uh--
(rising to his feet) Hey! Hey, you! (setting off after her) Come back here!! Don't gallop away!!
Where's uh, where's Allison..
What quit? (laughing) Who quit?
Well, I like a rolling writer. They're very smooth.
Did you buy this for me?
Right. (Mumbles) Nastercoff.. What country is he from, again?
Why not?
Yeah, he did.
It's one think to not give me the extension But to tease and to torture me like this. There's no call for that.
My bag?
I can do hard time for this one. And community service!
Whoa, look at this. This is a beautiful suit. Huh?
Yeah! Boy, she is something, isn't she?
Let me just say this. It is inhumane to make a man stand on his feet, in one spot for eight hours a day. Why shouldn't he have a chair?
Sweet Fancy Moses!
The better looking they are, the faster they go! I mean, I see they out there on the street, they're zooming around, like a blur. Like they have a motor on their ass.
Can't hurt you.
Because it's on TV.
Was it my fault?
I look like me and I'm working from the outside. Who do you think is in the better position?
Get out of the car!
We just came from Chadway's(?) What's going on.
What was that?
Enjoy, enjoy.
I lost it.
Yeah.
Yada yada yada...
Yes!
What?
Yeah. I love Hampton tomatoes. You know, you can eat 'em like apples. You know it's funny, the tomato never really took on as a hand fruit.
Who are they?
I like this area. I could live out here.
Here. Let me take your tabe downstairs for you.
It's my name. I made it up. You can't just steal it.
(waving Eva.
I thought the thing you said about the sex not being simulated . That was really funny.
What about architect, Steven?
Uuh, no, no.
This is fantastic. Man, what a weekend. Swimming, lobster for dinner...
Mmm.
All right. It's grovel time.
Yes, the surprise blindfold greeting. That wasnt in the manual, I dont know.
Ahh, Ah-AhWe had a deal!
All right, look. I'm getting the Chow Fung. You don't have to have any.
I got him Yankee's tickets! He got me a piece of paper saying "I've given your gift to someone else!"
Well, giddy-up!
Are the courses open?
Wait a second. (smells it). all right.
The cabin.. (Laughs nervously) Well.. (Pauses as he thinks of a way to break the news, then decides to pass it off) Susan?
(indicates with his head) The cashier.
Yeah. She should be commending me for treating everyone like equals.
Well, I don't really like her.
She asked about me? What did- What did she say?
George.. (She doesn't seem to recognize him) George Costanza.
I don't know.. you and Susan Davis?
(pointing to Jerry in joyous agreement) Ha-ha-hah. This is my lucky day.
You're giving me the "it's not you, it's me" routine? I invented "it's not you, it's me". Nobody tells me it's them not me, if it's anybody it's me.
I'll tell you what's insane the price that I could get you on a new desktop computer.
Wow. What'd you say?
Every summer you guys went to camp together. I was jealous. Felt like he was the summer me.
I take it off when I go to the, uh, y'know, to the "office".
This could be in a museum some day! It's not safe with me! It should really be in a doormanned building.
Say you go to the bathroom at two o'clock in the morning, what's the outfit? I mean, you dressing up or is it come as you are?
Hey.
I gotta stay one step ahead of Neil.
(standing) Oh yeah, Reilly? (smugly) Well, the jerk store called. They're running outta you
So, you live with your mother, huh?
Whoa...it's like a furnace in here!
Guess not.
Why, you think I should?
(snaps fingers) There you go.
What?
Mine too.
Now let's try "breast"... Celeste... Kest...
Bye-bye.
He wouldn't put it on if he didn't like it.
Elaine?
(offers his) Oh, you want to taste mine.
(dismayed) I didn't even know you wanted to get serious!
Oh, god. Look who's here.
Its unbelievable. You know what else is unbelievable? I picked up the check. She didnt even offer. She ended it. The least she could do is send me off with a sandwich.
Jerry, I've been preparing for this moment my entire life.
They're -- They're killing independent George! And they're, they're all in on it! World's are colliding!
But my friend here has hypothermia.
(smiling) Uh, hi. Uhm, remember me? I..I'm the guy who looks like Neil?
People who do that should be arrested.
I don't know, but those are my socks! I had a pair just like that with the blue stripe, and now I don't have them anymore!
Well, maybe she decided to celebrate her birthday on the Monday after the weekend.
O.k....(thinks) I think I know where we can get one.
Can't find them. That's marvelous. The dance continues.
Actually, I never had any formal training. I guess I'd be better suited for improvs, or something..
You told her? How could you tell her? I told you not to say anything.
Wow! Heh. (Half kidding) You don't, huh, have a replacement lined up for me, do ya? heh he he he he he...
(at dinner with his cousin) Some more merlot?
Yes, as I see it.
Y'know... I could hear you on the other line...
What is it about sex that just disrupts everything? Is it the touching? Is it the nudity?
In six games.
(sets down his paper) So how were the eggs?
No, no I do. You know it's just...
I dont know what the hell I said. I gave her an ultimatum and theres nothing I can do. Its a machine. The little light is blinking right now, Come and listen to the idiot. Hey everybody, the idiots on!
Now you're off on a topic.
I feel fat.
Okay, we'll go!
It's just paper on a roll, that's it. And that's all it will ever be.
He said he didn't know what it was.
All right Mrs. S. I and my good pal Keith Hernandez will be right back.
Me? I didn't say anything.
(To Kramer) You want to start?
Ahhh. How does this thing work?
Oh, I don't know.
Shes right above you?
Students cant clean. Its anathema. (explaining) They dont like it.
(to Jerry, yelling) You told her? She's not your wife!
Bother, wa', what kind of bother?
I don't even know what they think. That's why I'm in therapy.
We hardly read anything!
No, I don't have it yet.
Elaine.. I have to tell you something...
Alright I happen to know what they did last night, they had dinner with Kramer.
So uh where are the clothes?
You only went in front first 'cause you saw me backing up and you didn't have room to parallel park!
Listen, lemme ask you a question. What if I got a cup of coffee with her?
I love it. New office, new salary. I'm the new Wilhelm.
I'll fight ya! Not the face! Not the face! (The struggle continues.)
Boy, these really do pinch the nose.
See, this should be a show. This is the show.
Oh, you're fine... you're fine. (looking at Tom in the back and then quieter to Jerry) So you think this guy playing Kramer took the raisins?
Does that mean I have to go too?
What a mind.
(Interrupting) Jerry, No!
Who?
Hey, you're hurting me!
Are you sure?
Oh, this is good. This Kruger guy is clueless. I can't wait to work for him.
What? Where are you going?
Hey, now you're onto something.
You don't know?
You're gonna rip it. You're gonna rip it.
(agitated) Well, I, I couldn't come. I, I had to drive my mother to, to the chiropodist.
Shouldn't we at least drop off your bag?
You-you sure you never slept with her? (Jerry shakes his head 'no') Perfect.
They're all the same. You go, you sit, you eat popcorn, you watch. I'm sick of it.
It's stuck on a piece of cloth here. I can't get the cloth out.
Aren't you concerned about the security guard?
I can't eat this without catsup. Would it kill her to check up on us? Would that be a terrible thing? "How's everything? Do you need anything? What can I do for you?"
It's too late.
(PROUDLY) Me too.
What, was that not politically correct? It's a legitimate question.
So, she fell, and then she started screaming, "My back! My back!" So, I picked her up and took her to the hospital.
No, but I can tell she's going to. I can sense it. We had this terrible phone conversation. I was so nervous before I called I made up this whole list of things to talk about.
They would never tell me, Elaine. First of all, they probably think that I killed Susan. Besides, I don't even think they like me. (Jerry comes over to the table.)
Yes. She's got great skin - a rosy glow..
No, she wasn't on the horse.
You do?
What if I want to walk around a little?
Hello.
To the hospital.
He's extremely Murphy. He's Murphy to a fault.
Marisa Tomei! I, just spoke to Marisa Tomei! (sitting opposite Elaine) And I wasn't even that nervous.
Listen. Let me ask you something. If you and Mona were ever to... dance, how do you decide who leads? I mean... do you take turns? Do you discuss it beforehand? How does that work?
What, you don't want to be you?
Wow. Nice.
Trapezoid?
What're you doing? What're you, telling secrets? What're you laughing at?
Well , not yet.. Fianc.
(Sees Gwen's meal) Hey, soup.
I mean, we're not stupid, right? We know when something's funny!
You know it's like you never see a really attractive woman getting a traffic ticket.
Uh...no.
I watched "Beaches" on cable last night. (wings?)  Give me a break.
You see, hu, ho ho.
Nothing. It's a card from my dad.
This is it! It happened to me, Jerry! I was sitting in the restaurant, the two nut jobs were talking - I couldn't take it any more. I got up, and (Makes a noise) I bop into this woman..
Well, what happened when you got upstairs?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's in the vault. I'm putting it in the vault.
Alright, forget Elaine.
Hello Stu.
So, that's it. All of my darkest fears, and... everything I'm capable of. That's me.
We go into NBC.
Well, it's about Holly Go-Lightly.
Kramer, Kramer's not here...I knew it. I knew it! I knew this would happen. (SCREAMING) Kramer! Kramer!
Shadow!
Well you know, if you were sitting right next to her you'd have to console her no matter what.
Hey, there's a guy up the roof.
Jerry, it's fantastic. I love the people over there. They- they treat me so great. You know they think I'm handicapped, they gave me this incredible office, a great view.
I got scared there for a second. The Knicks without Ewing.
(Snapping) Is that important, really? What is this, a police investigation? The woman's been through enough. She has to relive the experience now?!
bowling! what do you say bowling? bowling's insane! bowling is crazy time
Well, you know. (grins, snorts) It's understandable.
Don't you see how wrong that is?! Where's your Christmas spirit? And eye for an eye!
No, no thanks.
Gennice palying today?
Yeah! like the big toe is like the captain of the toes, but sometimes the toe next to the big toe gets so big that there's like a power struggle and the second toe assumes control of the foot.
Yeah. Thanks for, thanks for coming by fellas. Eh, got a set of keys, buried in the pothole.
Whats the rent?
Going backstage is the worst. Especially when they stink. You know that's a real problem.
Ah, get outta here. The vomiting is much funnier.
(angry, to himself) The ocean called. Running outta shrimp. Outta shrimp! (a thought occurs) Oh! Yes! That's what I shoulda said! (frustrated shout) Dammit!
Supposed to close with the swirl?
Alright, just make sure he reserves the good chair for me. Wait, what are you gonna tell him about the clanking noise in the car?
Hey.
If anybody should be getting more it's you.
I was personable. Don't you think I was personable?
Hey, what's another million, give or take. I get off where and when I wanna get off.
(hearing Elaine over the phone) What, she's out?
...It was all a terrible misunderstanding, sir. Just five minutes. Just five minutes of your time. (listens) Thank you! Thank you, Mister Dalrimple.
I like herbal tea.
Sh, sh, goodbye, sh, get away.
Then who are the Dutch?
O.k....(is about to explain. Cut to Jerry on-stage.)
I like to stop at the duty free shop.
Joe...
Oh, please. (to the teller) Can you change this into bills?
Ah, alright. Believe me, that kid's gonna be called Soda.
Dad, you really should lay off the 'serenity now' stuff.
There you go, okay? That's my *other* friend's ticket. You happy now? You got two tickets.
N.I. Not interested.
(waving apologetically) Not you.
ahh.....!!
This is like a Penthouse letter...Why can't I meet women like this?
Let me ask you this. If you stick your hand in the hair is it easy to get it out?
Thank you very much. You just stand over there, I?ll stand over here.
Like you do.
He did it right as he said "her unfortunate accident."
Algae, obviously plankton, hmhm. I don't know what else I could tell ya, ah, Oh I-I just got back from a trip to the Galapagos Islands, I was living with the turtles.
There was nothing else on. Oh, the left arm.. the left arm.
Yeah,yeah!! I'll pick you up right now.....All right All right....Hey! gotta go.
Oh, Noooo, I'm so sorry. It's the MOOPS. The correct answer is, The MOOPS.
I like Christian rock. It's very positive. It's not like those real musicians who think they're so cool and hip.
Who?
Lights out.
The comedian, or the manager?
Can I go like this?
It's an expression.
And in bed--
Well I've never met your sister but obviously these are not hard-and-fast rules. (to the waitress) Darling, the tea is getting a little cold sweetheart.
(taking out wallet) Well, let me. Heh. Let me just eh.. check an', make sure I have the right man--ha! Heh, heh, heh! Seems--oh! I, oh! (has conveniently dropped the photo into her view)
(animated) It failed here! Because, here, every time you turn on a TV, all you see is four morons sitting round an apartment, whining about their dates!
How 'bout Kramer.
(Pleading for them to stop) Mom.. dad.
Youre gonna be neighbors.
What did you have?
Great, great. So anytime you want you can just visualize her naked.
Hey.
Nice.
So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified! But I pressed on -- and as I made my way passed the breakers a strange calm came over me. I-I don't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment  I was a Marine Biologist!
Yes, yes, I definitely waited. But let me say this Once he passes on that option, that 'God bless you' is up for grabs.
Absolutely. You just tell him the truth.
How about Chinese?
(embarrassed/self-conscious about his gut) Do I? Thanks.. You too..
And the amazing thing is she eats like there's no tomorra'. I mean I've never seen an appetite like this. Desserts. Everything. I don't know how she does it.
Thanks.
(holding his cane) I gotta hobble. (walks out)
Get up, get up, its her! Oh, the hell with this, Im scared to death, just walk away, its off, cancel everything, go!
No, thanks.
Yeah.
Great.
Ha! (grabs his coat and exits the apartment)
It was fantastic, Jerry. We wound up talking all night.
You just checked your watch. Are you thinking of bailing on him?
Always.
Can't be done.
(singing) Lemon tree, very pretty and a lemon flower...
I mean I'm the one who bought it.
Only if you buy. I gotta make a sale.
I like it!
Now, this is the basic layout for Mario's Pizza.
Yes.
Well...I've got a lot to do!
I don't have a job!
Mmm-hmm. You reneged.
Yes!
Alright, I gotta go. I'm heading over to Bonnie's.
Uh-huh.
I, I really should go home. Ya.. actually I'm planning on spending the day with my father tomorrow (short laugh) we're uh we're going to a father-son picnic, just the two of us.
Why, you think you can, beat me up?
Well, they get very hot in the polyester. You know, it's not a natural fibre. I think they would prefer cotton.
What kind of operation is it?
Hey...you don't think...sure, that's Jon Voight's pencil!
I'll tell you what I'd like to do. I'd like to replace that rye.
Maybe they forgot to put it out!
No. That's disgusting!
Is there any money involved?
Gimme the purse!
Alright, I'll tell you the truth. I'm not gay. My name's Buck Naked, I'm a porno actor.
Well let me hear....( they struggle for the headphones)
Umm, Im not. Its just a sociological experiment!
What is Tungsten or Wolfram?
I left it at Heather's. Are these alive? (pounding on glass display)
Heh, that's right. See ya later. (Exits.)
Wow, just felt your material?
Good to see you again.
You know, I can't talk to you anymore.
I'll die out here.
No. I wouldnt even have to tell her. I could surprise her.
I was telling you about Noel.
No Don't get the camera , we don't need the camera. Listen I know your skeptical , but I really believe in the Chinese.
So, what's in the cooler? (flips open the lid)
He's on the lamb(?), he's on the loose!
I don't know, about three days.
What is with this dog, I thought we were taking it to the pound.
Are you going to help me or not?
She probably never heard it. Don't you see what this means? It's like the whole thing never happened. It's like when Superman reversed the rotation of the earth to save Lois Lane!
(jubilant) Five thousand dollars? She doesnt have five thousand dollars!
What a movie. Good choice.
No.
Yea Yea Yea
Howbout Kramer or Elaine, they don't want them?
You don't understand. He's got this big party coming up. He's been looking forward to this for months. This is gonna destroy the whole thing.
Why?
[to himself] Oh, my God! It's Susan! What do I do?
So, you're taking his side?
Oh, great guy.
Tell the cop.
I wouldnt think so.
Oh yes I am
Wow. (he runs his fingers through his hair, and then brushes the resulting fallout off his jacket)
(to Jerry) Huh-ho! Have you ever seen anything like this?
No! Absolutely Not!
Well, I didn't mean to hurt you kid.
You tellin' 'em about the butler story? Is that beautiful or what? Hey, sorry I'm late. (Looks at Rita) Russell?
Let me ask you something. What do you think of this shirt?
I don't find her attractive.
I can't. I gotta make the weekly call to the folks.
I was trying to stick the landing. (indistinct) ...was right around here.
Don't worry, I got it.
Come on!
Excuse me, darling, do I detect a Portuguese accent?
(to Elaine) What are you doin' here?
Okay, so you remember I made the initial call Sunday, she doesnt call back. I call again Monday, I leave another message. I call Tuesday, I get the machine again, I know youre there, I dont know what your story is. Yesterday, Im a volcano  I try one more call, the machine comes on, and I let fly like Mussolini from the balcony, Where the hell do you get the nerve? You invite me up for coffee and then you dont call me back for four days? I dont like coffee, I dont have to come up. Id like to get one more shot at the coffee just so I could spit it in your face.
No I, I want it if you dont want it.
(Leading Nina out the airport) Oh, no. No. We're good. Let's get goin'. Alright. (Almost bumps into Jerry) Watch it, funny man. (Leaves)
Oh. The summer me.
Like a park bench?
What are you doing here, I though you were going to the airport.
No, it's nothing bad. I'm getting married.
What about the skin? I need a good cheek, I like a good cheek.
Yeah, dentist of the stars.
Good for you (sympathetic)
(Unconvincingly coy) About what?
'Just listen to the music of the traffic, in the city. Linger on the sidewalk, where the neon lights are pretty.' Where the neon lights are pretty. The Broadway area?
What about Six?
Okay, go ahead. Call her, get married, have babies, have a great life.. What do I care? I'm finished. (Really depressed) It's all over for me. In fact, let's end it right now. Jerry, kill me, kill me now. I'm begging you. Let's just get it over with. Be a pal.. Just take the pillow and put it over my face.
(knocks) You hem... wanted to see me Mr. Steinbrenner?"
What?
(smiling) Ho ho. Funny. Isn't he funny? Funny guy. Ha ha ha.
Photo store Sheila.
Because I'm REFRESHED. I finally found a way to sleep in my office. Under the desk. I lie on my back. I tuck in the chair. I'm invisible.
I went in with a pretty woman? You know, kinda short, big wall o' hair, face like a frying pan?
Rick.
You know it's a public phone, you're not supposed to just chit-chat.
Ma!
(shifty) Yeah.
I'm too nice.
Double jump! Eat the fly! Eat it!
(light) No. No, no, no. The cushion was turned over.
Well, she's smart. You take my word for it.
Well at least you and I are talking about how there's nothing to talk about.
You're Batman.
You know what word Susan used last night? Hnuh. Vault! hu,
You gotta give us odds. At least two to one - you gotta put up two-hundred dollars.
They wanna have another meeting? They wanna buy it?! They wanna but it?! Oh! I tell you! We're gonna be rich!! What are we gonna get for this? Fifty, sixty thousand?
Yeah.
It's standard. Has she left you one of those messages where she uses up the whole machine?
No, what?
The Frogger is here.
How could they not notice it?!?
Plenty of mosquitoes.
This woman just set me up for a job!
I-I'm already here. I'm here. I'm here. Uh, you know what? If you want a computer, call me. I-I gotta go.
That's right, you heard me. Get out! You are ruining this whole experience for me!
Potussan. Ever try it with club soda?
What signal? What-what signal?
What do you mean "might"? You don't think he really owned this car?
Ok uh, I guess I'll tell them that.
The Switch?
So you - you really don't have my hat?
She invited me up. Coffees not coffee, coffee is sex.
Aw, well, you know, it's your anniversary. It's - it's the least I can do. I - I just want you guys to go out and have a good time. Ha ha. So, you think we should, uh, we should get downstairs?
You can't do that, it's none of your business!
You went home with him?
Why does everything have to be 'us'? Is there no 'me' left? Why can't there be some things just for me? Is that so selfish?
I'm not stealing it. They owe me ten dollars. They stole from me.
(Showing an example) What'd you do today?
So, I've got ice cream all over my face. There were no napkins there. Whoever it was that's responsible for stocking that concession stand cost me a relationship.
" 'course not"
The, uh, actor that played Jesus made some odd choices.
(amused) You're supposed to do that?
Well, he's merry.
So, I ran into the Rosses again.
Yes, but I am not taking it.
Why was he wearing a cape?
(after Wendy and to the receptionist) Oh, you have a policy! (to the world at large) The delicate genius has a policy! George heads for the door.
That wasn't a laser pen.
Is there a meal allowance? What about seat assignments? Could I have the Kosher meal? I hear the Kosher meal is good. And I need clothes. Gotta get a haircut. Gonna have to, I have to refill my allergy medication. Oh, do I need a hat? I need a hat, don't I? Could we do the Universal tour? They have that Backdraft exhibit now, that looks very cool to me...
I know that's why I bought `em but they're not comfortable.
(melancholy) I wish that was all needed. Life can be so confusing. I..I'm searching for answers, anywhere.
I dont understand why you spend time with this guy.
Theres no way I touch that bag for less than two dollars.
The guy slept with Marilyn Monroe, he's in Dinky Donuts. What about this doctor's note? Let's go see your friend Roy.
All the way?
I think. (Pause as they all look down)
Yeah.
Oh. This I need. Hello!! Hello. i..i..is this the hair restoration clinic? ...Does anyone speak English?
(picking up his coat) Awright, I'm heading home.
Eighteen dollars.
How should I know?
Any money in it?
I know, I know...don't skimp. Go go go go...
Elaine, don't interrupt, they're discounting something.
Would they tune in?
What'd I say? Clara?
(Not amused with her answer) Eggs are eggs. That is very profound. (laughs; Daphne goes back to reading her paper) By the same token you could say fish is fish. Ha ha ha, I don't think so. (pauses) Listen Dophne
How do you know him?
Coco?
Well, it's just, all you said was 'your welcome', which is nice. It's very nice. But... I feel I gotta get the apology.
(from the street below Jerry's window) Jerry!
Elaine's in love with the Wiz guy?
(incredulous) What?
Hello.(with not a big smile)
Well the sex was okay, but I threw up from the Hennigans.
These old guys, they're up at 4 a.m., by two thirty they're wiped. (animated) How did we get back onto you?!
What do you mean?
Ah, come on!
Well, I'll tell you, Stacey. It's a lot of hard work. But, it comes fairly easy to me. Some people write symphonies. This is my gift. (Raises ski lift ticket while Stacey looks away)
I, ... am breaking up with, ... you.
They'll make you a Big Salad. What do you think, they're the only one's that make a Big Salad?
Elaine, shes a psychic. She knows how the kids going to be.
(To himself) So you're havin' the sex, next day you don't have to call. That's pretty good. (Back to Jerry) Go ahead.
Right, gotta get going.
What?
Sometimes, once in a while.
Marsala?
(To his girlfriend) Nina, you have to decide right now. Jerry or me?
Well, I didn't really think about what I was gonna do with all..
try shaking it...(long pause) Well,Janet should be here any minute.
Oh, hey, sorry I'm late.
Good, good day. How was your day?
If she doesnt show up, we cant possibly have dinner with him alone.
(Opens the door, looks in and then knocks 5 times) Mr. Steinbrenner, (waves) can I talk to you for a second?
A biopsy?
Can you do it?
What about your old car? They couldn't get Kramer's blood out of it?
Well, that pear shaped loser was me! And I was in that photo, until I broke in here, stole the photograph and airbrushed myself out of there!
(Losing it) Don't tell me how to eat!
Deena! Deena, wait a... Deena, help!
Well, I'm doing it, Jerry. I'm buying the Frogger machine. Now the torch will burn forever.
Well, I think we need more special days at the stadium, you know? Like, uh...Joe Pepitone Day. Or, uh...Jon Voight Day.
(resentfully dampened) It's not a prom. It's a Ball.
I don't know.
Nah, with crutches it's a funny story, with a cane it's a sad story. You through with those?
You're so uptight.
All right, let's--let's focus. Can we get back to the plan?
Yeah, I grabbed it on the way out, I don't want my mother reading it.
I know. I can tell. It's one of my powers. Why, did you ever fake?
All right, dammit, I'm in.
No come on, let me, let me. I smashed your car, it cost you over two thousand dollars,
(standing up) I'm just gonna go to the bathroom.
That's... what we used to call him in high school, the exterminator. He's a linebacker. Oh, did we have some wild times.
I am not! What you call wasting, I call living! I'm living my life!
I suppose he's an attractive man, I ,
Yeah, You remember the, the little eh, bank book, there?
(gets up and picks a mirror) Yes. Yes, it's white. Why it's white.
You must be very proud Mr. Visaki. (shaking his hand) And may I say sir they're lovely girls, absolutely lovely girls. It's nice to see such fine upstanding women in gainful employment, Mr. Visaki.
And-and you just decided to pop in...!
He had a TV show! He had cartoons!
Yeah, thanks.
I had a fight with Susan.
Shut up! Shut up!
Yeah, me too.
I don't want any mango.
Of course.
Oh you can stuff your sorries in a sack, Mister!
I'll have the Clams Casino.
No, say. I want you to say.
It's George
Haven't we had this conversation before?
Yeah. I think we really go something here.
It's not a pet! It's a wild invalid! And it knows that I tried to kill it. As soon as it gets better, it's gonna gnaw my brain out in my sleep!
"The phone's a piece of junk, goodbye"!
*I* think that *you* think that a certain *something* is not all that it could be, when in fact it is is all that it *should* be, and *more*!
Ha! Ha! Hey! (moving his arms like it's so great to be all here)
Oh the ego on you.
Hey. I got Jon Voight's LeBaron. (Jingles the keys.)
What do you want?
Oh, the actress-waitress?
It says that on the computer?
Nah, the cable's out. What's with you? You look dead.
This is our new Vice-president of Acquisitions, sir.
So, I broke up with Maura. It's done. I'm out.
No they don't. I tried that once. I snubbed for a year. Nothing. Every woman I saw, I snubbed. You never saw people so pleased. (Elaine returns from the bathroom.)
I dont know, I cant eat. You, you cant have anything anymore. Look at this, look at this. Eggs out. Coffee out. French fries out. BLT out! I go to visit my grandparents three big brisket sandwiches, Im sittin here with a carrot! Theyre closing in on a hundred, Im sayin to them, How can you eat that stuff? (They look at their menus again.) Im so sick about losin that choose, you dont know.
C-Communist? I am a Yankee, sir, first and foremost.
What about you and Elaine?
No, and you weren't funny last night either. In fact, you got us both so depressed, she asked me to drive her home after dinner.
Yes they did. I was covering. Elaine has been deported back to Scotland.
Well...Susan.
How do you know?
Wait a minute, Rinitze? Don't they have somme really cool suits in there?
(proffering glasses) I hope prune juice is alright. It's the only thing I had that was chilled.
you put him on the spot
Implied.
You're a very handsome man, by the way.
(singing) Master of the House/Quick to catch your eye/Never wants a passerby to pass him by...
Ahh, money.
(to Jerry, sarcastically) Yeah, doctor. Im going to have to wait in that little room all by myself, arent I? (He picks up a crossword puzzle.) I better take this. I hate the little room. (George walks into the hallway that leads to the doctors office.) Oh, hello, Doctor.
I've always liked her. Remember her in 'Carnal Knowledge'?
You're doing all the leg work.
You don't?
No, no...
Dad, it's me. Hey, listen, I was at Fortunoff's the other day, and, you know what, you were right.
Yeah, I feel like I've grown.
I've got nothing, I-I-I-I'm blank.
No, you said you didn't like it...
You, uh, you like baseball? [picks up baseball from desk]
you better be careful on those rocks tomorrow buddy. And you're not getting any sandwiches either
She's not gonna like it.
Well the guy's just standing there.
You sure?
I'm not kidding.
(shaking hands with Morty) Morty, always a pleasure.
Oh, hello Professor.
I'm as good as them.
Oh..
yeah!
Guys with cats... I dont know.
I just got here. My car broke down on the Belt Parkway.
Forget it? I already called my parents. I told them to expect the surprise of a lifetime. My mothers making her roasted potatoes!
Really?
Look at all of those! You're rich!
(shouting) How d'you not like Soda?! It's bubbly, it's refreshing!
91 dollars.
Well, that interests me very much Mr. Farkus.Very much indeed, sir.
Shh! This is it!
Well, last night she told me that she liked you. Not you, the disturbed you, so I had to tell her the truth.
Eh, there's that woman that never talks to anybody.
Sperry Rand Building. 14th floor, Morgan Apparel. Mention my name - she'll give you the key.
Oh, boy I was up to four in the morning watching the Omen trilogy.
From NBC?
With me or in general?
Well, I join them in their grief.
What's Yo-yo Ma?
I'm stuck. Pull a little, just a second. Don't start the train! Don't start the train!!
No...Why should that make any difference to you?
Well, sorry I missed that, uh, charity thing. But this was one of those truly glorious Hampton weekends that you always hear about.
No. That's just electric.
Well, OK. As I said the guy had it in for me. He actually failed me in gym. ... ME!
Because we brought it for them!
I've looked at that, seems unlikely.
Alright ok. You got the tape?
(Drawing attention back to him) Excuse me!
What do we have in the fruit department?
Yeah? Well, I had sex with your wife.
Its your apartment!
What's desert?
Why?
So now you're doing my bits?
(urgent whisper) Elaine! You have got to get me Marisa Tomei's phone number!
The death certificate?
Alright, I just have to go over to the Ross' apartment and drop off Susan's sunglasses. You'll come with me?
Maybe you should call your car phone.
Y'know, now you gotta ask her her name. It's so embarrassing.
(using the phone) Watch how it's done. Oh, hello, Mr. Vandelay? Would you like to buy a computer? Oh, really? Two dozen?
Wait a second. Think about it. He's not showing up. Wait till you see the line of cabs, its like forty-five minutes long. You said he's in Chicago.
(worked up) Stickin' it to me, Jerry.
Cmon, go for twenty-five hundred. Well do it together. Come on, come on. Were in it together.
Because, if I'm looking straight ahead, and something enters my field of vision, that's merely a happenstance. (Elaine loudly snaps and unfolds her napkin at the next table to get Russell's attention.)
I know it may sound shocking. But, I just can't stop myself from... wanting you.
So you lied to her?
So concerned was he, that word of his poor tennis skills might leak out, he chose to offer you his wife as some sort of mediaeval sexual payola?
I dunno sometimes...
So you're moving there for spite!
She might not be comfortable.
You broke up with her? Why?
Give me one.
Very good.
But your life is Peterman's. Now the bus tour, which is real, takes to places that, while they are real, they are not real in sense that they did not *really* happen to the *real* Peterman which is you.
Oh, I found him. He was sitting on the steps of the library. I sat down next to him. He smelled like the locker room after that game against Erasmus
Wyck.
My censor quit two years ago. He checked into a clinic. Emotionally exhausted.
You really think so?
(Defensively) He knows how to read. And he also knows finishing an entire book doesn't prove anything. And get this he's into architecture.
Helping people... Of course. Of course! It makes perfect sense! How could I *not* be doing this!? I am gonna help somebody, Dammit!
Alright, what's the difference. What are we gonna do now? He won't take our calls, we can't get into his office...
He knows?
I don't know. He said he wants to be my "key brother."
I don't know where you're getting this from. I....you're serious aren't you? Oh, (laughing) you see? You see, you just don't know my sense of humor. Dan, don't I joke around all the time?
In any other shoe, I lose two inches. I - I can't have a drop down. We were eye to eye, I can't go eye to chin!
Mmm, no. Boy, it really didn't come out too well, did it?
Oh I would love that. You think he'd really do it?
Nah - what for?
(Still on the hot water) What about shaving?
What was wrong with that? I had a different interpretation! Do you know anything about this pretzel guy?! Maybe he's been in the bar a really long time and he's really depressed because he has no job and no woman and he's parking cars for a living! (out the window to honking cars) Alright! Alright! Shut up! Shut up! I hear you! I'm coming down! These pretzels are making me thirsty!
Who's this, Blue Arrow?
I--I've been, walkin' around all night.. I've been thinkin' about Allison and me.. an' you--
Well... (shuts door) heeere we are (puts down his coat and chuckles)
It's Jerry's fault.
Oh yes, by no means, the mood. Let me know if there's anything I can do to lend support to the mood.
...velay.
Hey! Surprise, surprise!
Well not really...
By the way, have you spoken to Elaine yet today?
No, no, Hey I'll get it. What's in the BIG salad?
Yeah, don't worry. He can afford it.
What are these? (Holds test tubes to his head like antennae) Take me to your leader.
Ow! What are you doing under there? Hey, stop that! Don't eat that! That's not food! (to Robin) He's suckin' down Equal packets!
(sighs) She called Susan last night.
Well, I wanna talk to him about this.
Now she thinks we're gay, not that there's anything wrong with it...
It's worth a shot. (Goes to the door.)
It doesn't matter if it's more comfortable. It's wrong.
So uh where we eating?
Jerry, I need to borrow your camera.
I don't have my ATM card.
Because I kissed her in the meeting. Russell found out, he fired her over the phone. Finally, my stupidity pays off!
Nothing.
Should be a while though.
Huh?
Well I I ..put a lot of thought into this and I think I would like you to sign a prenuptual agreement.
Oh, please, somebody, stop this!
I'm moving to California.
You dont have to call that! Thats a rule!
I got to tell you I felt terrible. I really thought she was going to collapse and kill herself.
Yeah, okey, wait wait. That will separate.
I wanna bite into a big hunk of cheese, just bite into it like it's an apple.
'The lights are much brighter there. You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares, just go...'
This is George Costanza, I'm calling for my test results. Negative? Oh, my God. WHY! WHY! WHY? What? What? Negative is good? Oh, yes of course! How stupid of me. Thank you. Thank you very much. (he hangs up)
I got two tickets to see "Guys And Dolls".
So what do you care what she thinks.
I can't believe you called me a chucker. No way I'm a chucker, I do not chuck, never chucked, never have chucked, never will chuck, no chuck!
Oh, wow.
Forget Gammy.
Yeah.
As a suspect in a serial killing.
(Reluctantly) Well, okay.
Yes it is. She just took credit for my salad. That's not right.
Nah, I guess I should really get moving on this, huh? I'm gonna go. (Opens the door, letting Newman in. Leaves)
Well bear in mind that I am in the smaller office.
(Boiling) What am I going to say?!
9... 1... 1. She said she'd do anything. Hello, police? Uh, yeah listen, we're in the back of a limo in Queens--
(getting up out of his chair to get out of the Mohel's way) No, No.
Ooooo, I'm scared. . . . Ohoooo they're not going to do the show.
Ah, you still going on in front of Bania, eh?
That's it. This is it. I'm done. Through. It's over. I'm gone. Finished. Over. I will never work for you again. Look at you. (laughing) You think you're an important man? Is that what you think? You are a laughingstock. You are a joke. These people are laughing at you. You're nothing! You have no brains, no ability, nothing! (knocking object over on desk) I quit!
Do I smell?
Yeah, right.
Bania?
He's beboppin' and scattin', and I'm losin' it!
You remember my cousin Rhisa? I'm gonna date her.
(Mr.Wilhelm comes in and hears George yelling) You tell that son of a bitch no Yankee is ever comin' to Houston! Not as long as you bastards are running things!
Yeah.
Hey, where you just at the health club?
So you don't think she really has a boyfriend?
(doing the voice) Im slippery as an eel
She said first row! Right behind the dugout!
Jerry. I can't get fired.
Elaine, of course I'm concerned. I'm payin' for those meals. It's like throwing money down the toilet.
Please.
Find a job. Get an apartment.
I guess... (chuckles) today shes late.
Alright, so, go ahead.
No details?
And you! How many Twix does that make for you, today?! Like, 8 Twix?!
Me neither!
No everything is *not* going good. I'm very uncomfortable. I have no power. I mean, why should she have the upper hand. *Once* in my life I would like the upper hand. I have no hand-- no hand at all. She has the hand; I have *no* hand...
Well, we really should be-
She had a dude?
Awright, listen, can you uh, gimme a lift back to my place?
Hey! What is your problem?
Sweep?
You got that from Elaine.
Well, if he can regift, why can't you degift?
Oh, the hell with it. Let him kill me. I..
This prison stinks.
So fast? What about me?
Im a weed in Hitlers bunker.
You arms look like something hanging in a kosher deli.
Is he still nuts?
Do you think she gets to take any of those little bars of soap home?
Oh, yeah, sure, accident, right. She was aiming right at me like she was putting out a fire! Then, for the rest of the show, I'm sitting there with chocolate all over my shirt. Flies are landing on me. I'm boiling - I'm fantasizing all the things I'm gonna say when I see her. And later, finally, backstage when I talk to her, I'm a groveling worm. "What kind of chocolate was that? Do you throw any other foods?"
That's it?
You see, this is what I do with women. I start out too strong, now I have to become real, that's when it all falls apart. What good is real? They don't want real, they want funny.
Kramer, what are you doing here?
No No I'm working on a system...Who was that?
Yeah.
Uhh.. I'll- I'll meet you down there.
My tonsils? Yeah, when I was a kid.
It's...gotta hurt! Hurt! Because...Aaarrrrrgh!
Ok, fine. It's going to be very interesting, very interesting if they don't show up tonight. You know my mother made all this Paella.
The Lowers, really?
Nah, I don't like that one.
You don't believe me? Ask Jerry.
Very nice
What might that cost?
Well, they gave birth to me, and, yada yada...
Same thing!
Alright that's it. (George walks across the room over to them.) So you get rid of me and now the two of you are going to sleep together?
Rest... Sest... Hest...
Ah, come on
A free ticket?
(Arms out) I am king of the county. You?
A-hu no, uh, it's just that ...
Is there something wrong with my parents?
Cinnamon? Why didn't cha get chocolate?
Boy, you look really great.
That's like using a wheelchair for the fun of it!
What?
I'll give you a quarter.
Well, I didn't want to break our date.
But I mean look at him. He's gotta be on his feet like that all day? That's brutal. I think I'm gonna say something to your uncle.
Not possible.
Hu-Yeah, interest. It's an amazing thing. You make money without doing anything...
It's a calzone, sir.
Wait a second, wait a second...and then the butler says, "I'm not cleanin' it up! I'm sick of cleaning!"
Hey! Kramer.
So...?
Oh, yeah, right. I wish I had something on my mind. (pregnant pause) So how about that Kramer, huh?
What?
Hey, Lloyd. (Shakes hands with Lloyd) How's it going? (chuckles)
You don't like the move?
Oh. Oh. Yeah, sure. Here. Uh, sit down. Uh, uh, cheese, there? (he grabs a suit jacket from the desk chair and puts it on)
Mr. Tuttle, you're back.
Jerry, did you hear that?
(dryly) You're on that list.
Oh no - I'm so sorry, it's the Moops. The correct answer is the Moops.
Uh, I'm just selling some of Dad's things, (looking into Kramer's eyes) that's what he would have wanted.
How ya doin'?
Why don't you just get some Ring Dings from the liquor store?
It's not really a mental institution. It's more like a depression clinic. She went out to Woodhaven and checked herself in. I'm, I'm sick over this.
Divorce is very difficult. Especially on a kid.
Don't you believe me? It's their fiftieth anniversary. You know this is gonna kill him. You're aware of that. Kill him. On the biggest night of his life...
Well, what's the reason?
I don't think I've ever spoken to her.
That's where the Seinfeld's are moving. They got a great deal. Yep. You know what they got in Florida? Jai-Alai! You bet on the games, you clean up.
. All right , just give me my car and let me get the hell out of here.
No.
(indicating the window) Kramer, it's, it's raining. They got the tarp on the field.
I got engaged. I'm getting married. I asked Susan to marry me. We're getting married this Christmas.
Then... shouldn't you be wearing the bucket.
Maybe she wasn't! Maybe she heard the whole conversation!
(George, finger in the peanut butter jar) This is what I do.
Did you ever solve the riddle of the pie?
So how do you want to do this?
All right, but we're not buyin' it at Bloomingdale's. I will buy it, you pay me back later. I'll sniff out a deal. I have a sixth sense.
Yeah, so you gotta use something else.
I will never understand the bathrooms in this country. Why is it that the doors on the stalls do not come all the way down to the floor?
Hello, it's Natalie? Yeah, this is a business office but I'm not a business man per se. I'm here working for the people. Yes, I'm causing dissent. Stirring the pot. Getting people to question the whole rotten system.
Wow. Uh, what do I have to do?
Please. Give me another chance.
So, she's the loser of the group. Every group has someone that they all make fun of.. Like us with Elaine. (Jerry thinks about this, then shakes it off)
Eee-aaa-eee-aaa-eee-aaa...
Cause I tell you, frankly, I would like to walk in hear one day and find you sitting down. (Starts to walk out of the store) That would give me a lot of pleasure. Call me crazy.
You know what the temperature in Florida is today? Eh? Seventy-nine. That's almost eighty. Yeah, I read someplace the life expectancy in Florida is eighty-one and in Queens, seventy-three.
I don't know of this is the house. I don't see Jerry's car anywhere.
Lupe. That's very nice, very nice. Listen, are you going to be making up the bed in the morning?
Hum..( to Elaine) Hey! did you talk to Paula?
me? "step off"
You know what I was just thinking -- she could really use a raise.
Hey, where's you AIDS ribbon?
You have to stand tough sir. That's why I had to hang up the phone.
So they're flying the tiny instruments in from El Paso.
Wait a second, wait a second, what coming in, what woman is coming in?
You told him? What did you tell him?
Is there ever a good time to have your parents stay with you?
Yes. A male roommate.
You met her a few weeks ago, but...?
Is that right? I just threw away a lifetime of guilt-free sex, and floor seats for ever sporting event in Madison Square Garden. So please, a little respect. For I am Costanza Lord of the Idiots!
Here we are.
I'll tell ya, if I had one of these things, I'd be eatin' hot dogs all the time.
Why did you refuse the package. Everybody loves a package.
yeah that's right. I like it. He's such a cool guy
I think she wants me to take her home.
Sorry I'm late, but look what I found in the Yankee Hall of Pride display case.
Yeah, I do that too. I feel guilty about getting the pleasure. I feel like I don't deserve it so I talk. It stops me from enjoying it. There's nothing to eat in here.
Who?
The wedding is off. Now you can go to the Super Bowl.
Yeah.
Yeah. So, how's Cindy the maid?
What do you mean "into the patient"?
There are some people in this room who would have been very happy to never see this briefcase again. There are people in this room who think they can destroy other people's property and get away with it. Well, let me tell you something about those people. They weren't counting on this brain! And this tape recorder.
No not vast (he pronounces it as "vost")
How much tip do you leave on $8.15?
Oh, yeah, me too, me too. Boy oh boy oh boy...! You know, in fact, I've been thinking about it, and I feel like I'm stealing from you! Five-hundred dollars! It's gonna be worth thousands soon! You know what? On second thought, I can't even accept it.
(Modest) Oh, thank you very much. (Chuckles)
Who wears a cape?
He'll be back on Monday.
Just need to uh, to dig 'em up.
I always get myself in this position. Can't be on time. Gotta rush.
Wish I could help you.
Oh, uh...
It took a couple of hours of convincing. I was persistent. I was just like those guys in the movies. And it worked! She said "Yes"! I can't believe my luck that she was still available . A beautiful woman like that. You think she's good looking, right?
Someday, before I die, mark my words - I'm gonna tell that woman exactly what I think of her. I'll never be able to forgive myself until I do.
Well, it doesn't even have to be the general manager. Maybe I could be like, an announcer. Like a color man. You know how I always make those interesting comments during the game.
(frantic) I'm calling Jerry.
Yeah, I should do the opposite, I should.
So?
The locker room!
Latvia?
Ooh yeah, the bags, sure.
And then in the fifth inning, why did you take off on the pop fly?
Reprogram all the buttons, see if he changes them back. You know? The old switcheroo.
Why didn't you just tell her?
Oh, nothin' much, . . . talkin'. . . . Oh, oh, oh, did I have an unbelievable idea today!
I'm trying, dammit.
Huh... Cape... (turns, distracted, heads slowly towards door) What was a man with a cape doin' with my father?... What was my father doing with a man in a cape?... (opens door) Why a cape? Hmm! (exits)
Why would I...
(disbelief) What? (laugh) Wh... what're you talking about? I'm not the one with the problem. (defensive) Lloyd Braun was in the nuthouse, not me.
(admiring himself in mirror) I did.
(pause) Alright if you think it's too much they don't have to mail the postcards.
Right, right.
(Nervous) Wh-what are you talking about? That - that's rediculous.
When are you going on your next date with her?
It's over, Jerry. She's gettin' out.
All right, just gimme that. And gimme some of those Sweet & Lows.
Shake his hand?
What, a 'little' cologne.
What is that? Is that cashmere?
A cup of coffee. That, that doesn't mean anything.
Oh, my God, No, oh my God, . . . Jerry!
Well all right, beautiful, so you stop in. Ya, ya visit the bubble boy for twenty minutes and then we can go.
I uh got the first name.
Oh, Scott, Scott. He's really great, isn't he?
The table is interference, you know it!
How did you get all this?
So, much longer?
(Smiling) You got it, Ma. (She smiles back, nodding) A little later. (George sits back in a nearby chair, looking at the divider in anticipation)
Where's Elaine?
I didn't do nothin'.
It's *not* *true*!
Please, this is very, very important.
(to Jerry) Ready?
You are?
Yeah. It doesn't make any difference.
Because they were heated up there.
What, you think I could postpone it?
Hey.
Yeah, let him chew on that for a while.
Uh, Elaine, this is, uh, Lloyd.
I'm wearing some cologne, all right?
So? Where are we going?
Is he dead?
I got to go after her.
(Scoffs) Writer. We're talking about a sit-com.
What is this thing doing here?
It's huge!
(picking up what Frank saw as a mouse) It's the remote.
Jerry, my vacation just started. I need a day or two to de-compress. Besides, I did plenty today.
Yes, it was purple, I liked it, I dont actually recall considering the buttons.
How engrossing?
I didn't.
"No I didn't"
(leaving) Yeah, Sure, sure ,,, I got to drop my car off at the new lot.
Whyie?
(standing) Yes, payroll. Yes I did. Very productive. Payroll... Paid off.
Ah ha, Ah ha. You would, wouldn't you?
You would think that at the end of the week when they hand out the checks, throw in a few soaps.
What's your name?
I think you absolutely have to say something to this guy. Confront him.
It's Allison. I dated her right after you. She's obsessed with me.
I know who it was too. It was the guy who interviewed me. He was very threatened by me. Why else wouldn't he hire me? I could sell latex like that (snaps fingers).
What's that?
No. Just imagine her reaction.
Well that was a really stupid thing! You know what's going to happen now?
Kramer. Anything good in there? Any Popsicles?
Yeah?
25 kids for his birthday party? (to kid under table) Don't put your tongue on the floor! He's putting his tongue on the floor! Here, here, have some more sugar packets. (tosses some Equal packets under the table)
You never run out, do you? (Jerry smiles.) Where's Kramer? Everything's finished here.
Maybe Manya missed the funeral because she was off visiting another galaxy that day.
I knew it.
(oozing fake sincerity) Well, as much as I enjoy all the good-natured ribbing, nothing really makes me happier than spending money on the people I care about.
(chuckles) Bye, thanks. (To Jerry, when Susan is far) I can't believe she took the money.
They don't need any water, so you don't have to keep taking them to the bathroom.
Not even an apple.
I didn't know whether to try and keep her from falling, or zip up.
Thanks Mike. Nice to be aboard.
(annoyed) Good for the tuna.
I don't think we should. We really don't know each other very well.
Oh, come on, it's five minutes.
Wait a minute, call the car phone, see what happens.
I hear everything.
Yeah my parents have it. Sometimes it skips a generation.
How's the trip?
I can't sell the book. It's been marked.
No, no. Hes just being modest.
I DON'T KNOW. It's this place. I'm very uncomfortable here.
You've got 'shiksappeal'. Jewish men love the idea of meeting a woman that's not like their mother.
Keys. I can't find my keys.
Please, it's--
Of course not! Wash it, dry it, move on!
I don't know.
That's an interesting question.
Let me just see it for a second.
Where are you goin?
Yearn? Do I yearn?
One, two ... three, four.
(on phone, as Jerry gestures beside him) No, Lindsay, it was not IN the garbage. It was above the garbage. Hovering. Like an angel. Of course I know your aunt bit it. I kissed her goodbye. Listen, can I tell you something else? In my family, we used to eat out of the garbage all the time. (Jerry makes a face) It was no big thing. That's right. Oh, okay. Buh-bye. (hangs up phone) I'm back in, she gave me a second chance.
What is that?
You go in the living room. I'll take the test in here.
No, they had plans.
No, really. No, no, thanks.
No, I didn't.
(singing) Master of the house/Doling out the charm/Ready with a handshake and an open...
Yes, flowers. I will get her flowers, I will go to the florist!
Why did it all turn out like this for me? I had so much promise. I was personable, I was bright. (Elaine turns showing disagreement) Oh, maybe not academically speaking, (Elaine nods correct) I was perceptive. I always know when someone's uncomfortable at a party.
Well, why would the guy make up something like that? Of all the names he could pick, why settle on Jon Voight?
It was more like a full bodied dry heave set to music.
It is. I'm just not ready yet.
Alright, let's see, let's see. What else. What else. Oh yeah, what does she do?
Thanks, see you later, Donna.
Hello everybody.
Not the point!
All right?
You can't just walk into a building and say " I wanna be a talk show host."
Yeah. Yeah. With all that kissing and the shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy out in public like that. It's disgusting!
Were you just talking about me? What's going on?
Do you ever just get down on your knees and thank god that you know me and have access to my dementia?
What's the difference? Let's go to Reggies.
Well I, uh, I'm not sure how you pronounce it or anything, but I, uh, I believe it's Mnage  Trois?
Hello! All right, we should be going. Come on...
Ha! Heh.
Yeah. Well aparently word's out.
Yeah, that's what I want-- triangles. Alright, I'm outta here. Have fun with what's-her-name.
Jerry, a throat-clear is a non-verbal implication of doubt - he thinks I killed Susan!
Yeah. So how does that help me?
Guess what.
Busy. Don't give me busy. Who's not busy? I'm busy, we're all busy, everybody's busy. All right, tell me, what's kept you so busy?
Well, aren't you the boss of him? You shouldn't let him move up! When I was in the Cub Scouts, I got stuck on Weebolos for three years 'cause I kept losing the Pinewood Derby.
And now?
He can't not be funny.
No problem here.
Who is this Rava?
It was on a magazine! And it still had the doily on.
So, how come nothing ever happened between you and Nina? (Getting paranoid) Is there a problem with her? Is she a man?
So?
Oh, my God! My *MOTHER*!!!
Well, it wouldn't fit you. The sleeves are too short.
Yes, now. It's gonna take a few days and my parents are gonna be back. I gotta have it back before them!
What kind of a sick person would do a thing like that?
No, no, no, no, Im It. I win.
You know, Ive been thinking. I cannot envision any circumstances in which Ill ever have the opportunity to have sex again. Hows it gonna happen? I just dont see how it could occur.
Don't worry, don't worry, no scenes.
Uh, uh, yeah. Actually, the, uh, I-I bumped my elbow on a desk and uh injured something an.. now it sort of moves involuntarily.
. . . gone?
You know the anxiety you feel on a date? That's what I have every day now. My worst nightmare's come true, every day is a date.
Who is this? (sees photo)
(Annoyed) If that helps you..
(to Danielle) Whose cane is this?
No, something's off here, you hesitated.
The busboy's coming?
Yeah, I didn't mean that.
He's right! It's the same thing with the femenists. You know, they want everything to be equal, everything! But when the check comes, where are they?
When I hear her name mentioned.
Jerry?
It varies.
Oh. I know they have some monies.
No! No!!
What about these two? Aren't they gonna chip in?
Kramer. Guess what.
Thats it.
Wow.
What?
Ahh. Good for you.
Well we were all eating the raisins. And I remember you--you were eating some of the raisins. And then you left, and the raisins were gone. And I was just wondering if, you know (chuckles), maybe you took them with you.
Fifty bucks a month, that's incredible! Okay, thanks.
What? Rate-aholics?
I'm cold too. At least you've got a coat. Let's get in the car.
Lowes Paragon, 84th and Broadway.
All right.
Oh. (Goes back into the bathroom.)
Time like what? I'm hungry. My stomach doesn't know that Kramer's wanted.
Which one?
No no no, you know actually we are friends of a serial killer.
That's right. I'm two in the hole!
First class doesn't make it anymore. Now you get on the phone with Kimbrough, tell him what happened and tell him to get another plane down here, but this time, the good one - the Ted Danson plane.
How ya doin'?
He stole your girlfriend?
Anyway, right in the middle, the ship blows up-- burning debris, bodies falling-- and then just as this eerie silence settles over the airfield, I yelled out, "That's gotta hurt!"
I'm back in business, baby!
You schedule a late meeting.
(Long pause) ..Felt like it. I tell you, this doll is pretty spooky. (Takes off his glasses, rubbing his eye) It's freakin' me out man. And now I got to go back out there and pick up this doormat.
You're kidding.
That should be 14, let me just...(corrects it with a pen.)
I mean, they're retired.
Well Kramer's not an usher anymore.
And I cancelled plans to go to the movies with them tonight.
Yeah, that's right.
A drafty apartment? A... sweaterless friend? A ball-game giveaway Metlife windbreaker?
Oh, no.
Do you think chickens have individual personalities?
You don't have to pay for the massage?
And, it is all because of that car
Alright, now the play is tomorrow night. So do you want to have dinner first, or do you just want to meet at the theatre?
So it was my comment that broke them up?
What? Too short?
Okay, the point is made.
Yea I-I know about the cups.
Eh, listen Mr. Kruger, I got a message from Dr. Van Nostrand and he says it might be wise to you to see another doctor about that mole.
Maybe Im right? Of course Im right.
(Angry) Yeah, that's what they told me the last time.
I'm back, baby, I'm back!
You're calling her?
You wanted to see me, Mr.Steinbrenner?
That was an honest mistake.
We got a chocolate malt in here!
All right. Kramer, you block off traffic. You to go sweet-talk the pharmacist.
A pack of teenagers?
Better get that checked out?
(Very loud in the direction of a waiter) I'm gonna need a coffee here. Very hot! Boiling!
What's with all these people having babies?
(breaks a long silence) The uh, the shoe laces that you bought me, they uh, they worked out well. (thumbs up)
Yeah. Did you do it?
Bovary! (points finger again at Jerry)
Well it's a little strange. You going to start to talk like Elaine from now on?
Yea
Nobody's hiring now. The market's terrible.
How ya doing?
Uh, no, I, I dont think so.
What, I can't stop by and visit my parents? (Drops pamphlet on coffee table)
Hate the big coarse "ha." Hate those.
Excuse me, are you going to be much longer? I have to make a very important call.
Do you wanna fight?
we rode along all the way to the hospital
More wine and turkey? (Pours Celia more wine)
Oooh.
I'm sure you are.
(Takes it and throws it out window) Get outta my way!
I know, sir. It won't happen again.
Sure, sure, sure, sure. (patting Jerry on the shoulders) How about these seats? Are these fantastic, huh? Huh? I feel like Lincoln.
(Losing it) I guess everyone here enjoys giving the old screwgie, huh?! Youre all doin a hell of a job! (Looks longingly at the Twix in the machine) Ho, ho. What I would do with you..
What is Borax?
Why did he tell you and not me?
What?
Hi,
Did you see that? The guy's walking away. What is wrong with you? That was a three hundred dollar profit.
(Breathing deeply) That's very dirty. (Jerry nods) That's absolutely filthy.
"Hemmm!.. Fine!"
Personal matter.
Hey. There is a couple of people that wouldn't mind having me out of the way.
Not exactly. What does that mean?
No thanks.
Watch me.
I can't. He's been on my case about not paying attention. Besides, it's too late, I already told him I heard him.
I need to look for my glasses.
I...was trying to lead the way. We needed a leader! Someone to lead the way to safety.
What, are you crazy? It's a traumatic thing to be thrown up on.
Aw great. Now the volume knob fell off
She had this throaty , sexy kind of whisper.
Well who doesn't.
Well, I'm sure they'll be able to fix it. You can't stop modern science. Can't stop it, you can't stop it. Can't stop science. Can't be stopped, no way, no how, science just marches--
(Getting up) You know what? Maybe I should take off.
What should I do?
Oh Oh, here, lemme uh...
Have a good time.
Like if she wants to know if I'm pleased with something, she'll say, "Happy, Pappy?"
It became very clear to me sitting out there today, that every decision I've ever made, in my entire life, has been wrong. My life is the complete opposite of everything I want it to be. Every instinct I have, in every of aspect of life, be it something to wear, something to eat ... It's all been wrong. (chuckles) Everywhere.
I know what you're going through. Women. Who knows what they want?
There's elevators all over! It all looks the same.
Yeah!
Happy Festivus! (Sees Elaine) Yama - Hama!
I'm not going to see that nut doctor she went to Europe with.
Of course. We all do.
That'd be me.
(on intercom) It's George.
Yeah. Where's he taking you, by the way?
Are you often on business trip? Nice...oh, hey nice ice-bucket.
There she is. (waiving his arms quickly above the table - to nix the conversation) No no no no no no.
Oh, pretty good.
Where do you come up with this stuff?
(to Jerry) Why dont you just turn it inside out?
Here we go.
Nothing.
Well, then, I am gonna have to ask you to turn your key.
Oh... do I have to write him a note or something?
You came to see me. I work in the building.
So he walks out of the stall, he's been talking the whole time.
Two-man? It's all me. Kruger doesn't do anything; Disappears for hours at a time, gives me fake excuses. This afternoon I found him with sleep creases on his face. The only reason I got out to get a bite today was that he finally promised to buckle down and do some actual work. (turning around, George sees Mr. Kruger at a booth eating a piece of cake) Oh, I don't believe this. This is what I have to put up with, Jerry. (He walks over) Mr. Kruger? Who said he was going to do some actual work today? Who?
A hundred dollars.
I don't even drink wine. I drink Pepsi.
You think she liked me? She seemed to like me.
Oh, my god that's Saddam Hussein. The dictator.
Aw, I've just got to say it once, everybody else gets to say it, why can't I say it?
Maybe somebody did it and didn't take credit for it. Maybe it was already done and didn't need doing in the first place. I have no idea who did it, what they did, or how they did it so well. And you know what? Jimmy crack corn and I don't care.
Jerry, figure this out. I'm in the coffee shop, and this beautiful girl I could never even talk to, mistakes me for her boyfriend.
No!
(from other room) Uh, tippy toe! Tippy toe! Lemon tree!
I never heard of that.
What big salad? I'm going to the coffee shop.
...Huh!
Hey.
Krama. Open up! I--I know you're in there!
What if we grew muttonchops?
Id like a doggie bag for this please. (hands her plate to the waitress)
Yeah, she's a B.L.
He's with the touring company of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. He's the guy in charge of the wigs.
No.
So? For a twenty-five dollar cleaning, I can listen to some pointless blather.
Did she say why?
No problem. There's no problem. She just owes me ten dollars, that's all.
(incredulous) I look just like him. I. Me. (flings his arms out) This! This is what her boyfriend looks like. How is that possible?
'Hoochie mama'?
Ah, excuse me, Vice-president Coco, no one cares about your Gammy.
WOULD YOU PICK A STATION!!!!!
Kramer, Kramer, I need to know if Nina is refunding.
This you are not going to believe. Al Netchie, that pimple. Tells Daphne, not get this 'Not to get involved with me.'
Why couldn't you squeeze one of those stupid rubber balls to get your stress out? Why did you have to destroy *twenty-five* computers?
(disappointed) Oww.
Yes, I will do the opposite. I used to sit here and do nothing, and regret it for the rest of the day, so now I will do the opposite, and I will do something!
Isn't that the uh, Friars Club jacket?
We have a, three-o'clock appointments.
(still worried) He was pretty emphatic?
"There may be a problem with the phone, hold on"!
Fine. (hits his arm on the desk) Ow!
What's with the dog?
Anyway, we met with NBC about a month ago and they gave us the green light to go ahead and write a pilot. In fact, we got a big meeting with them tomorrow. They gotta approve of the story before we can write.
(realizing he was short changed) I was in the pool! I was in the pool!
(stands up) I am.
(pleased) You've made Jerry very happy.
Oh, pudding! You want some?
(crestfallen) But you said it was my call.
How? Cause Im an Idiot.
Pasta primavera?
You know what? I can't do this. I can't read books anymore; books on tape have ruined me, Jerry. I need that nice voice. This book has *my* voice. I hate my voice.
Is that Elaine?
(seeing Elaine and Puddy come into Monk's) Yeah. Hey, Lainie, Puddy.
You weren't thinking.
What? Every time I leave my house now I have to call everybody I know and ask them if they want to do what I'm doing?
So is it all over between you and... Marsha Mason?
(anxious) I forgot who I am! Who am I?!
I dont like to discuss figures.
Okay, I mean it's serious but--
I'll try a piece.
Not in the last fifteen minutes.
Yeah.
Well this is bad. I am really in a bad situation now.
Oh, nothing.
How could you not know her name?
I mean it's hard enough to meet a woman you dislike, much less like.
So you're Jason Hanke's supervisor?
[as if the word were totally foreign] My `stub'?
I didn't shave this morning. I don't feel like myself.
What if her experience with me *drove* her to it?
I told her I would have to think about it.
Uh... hey. I'm gonna get going.
Alright. I guess I just have to pick myself up, dust myself off, and throw myself right back down again!
I wont mope.
What kind of a shake does he have?
If you go now, I know what's gonna happen. We'll find the car, Jerry will show up, and then we'll never find you.
Hey, maybe I could bribe one of those women that hand out the towels in the powder room.
Yeah, me either.
Slippery Pete?
Okay.
Yes, oh yes very much.
Wha..? I didn't tell you? I gotta go meet Elaine.
(on intercom) It's George.
So what do you want me to do?
Kramer, what are you doing?
You mean a walk back in? That's the toughest move in the business. You're sending me out into no-mans-land, and if I get shot down I have to crawl all the way back. Well I can't do it! I can't do it, I tell ya!
I have to rewind it first. (George presses the rewind button on the tape recorder. He and Jerry stand there, waiting impatiently as it rewinds.) Alright, alright.
Hey hey.
(Losing it) does not imply transfer of ownership. Moe, Sol, or Lem is not gonna get away with this!
Get out!
What are you gonna do with all of them?
Oh, the bookstore girl. How's that goin'?
What was wrong with that sorry? It was a good sorry. Jerry, was that a good sorry?
(little subdued) Nakahama Broadcast Corporation.
And they say appearance is not important.
Like what?
I told her that she was pretentious.
It's Susan
please please I don't want to die up here. please, stop moving that's all I'm asking.. Kramer!!
Oh no! Im vigilant. Theyll never get me out. Im like a weed, Jerry.
I thought were a team.
Medium turkey chili.
Like who?
What about personality?
Oh, gotta get fifty. Gotta get fifty. All right, I tell you what. We go to the coffee shop, you call your manager. Maybe they made an offer.
And she slaves to earn every penny. So that someday, I might be able to walk up to a woman and say, "Yes, I'm bald, but I'm still a good person."
(shocked) When do I start?
Who?
Yeah.
This guy's giving me the stare-ahead.
(As he leaves) One would hope.
Of course he is. There's got to be houses for rent in Tuscany. Do you know how big Tuscany is?
Oh, thank you.
Oh I missed the Maestro?
Well, I like to stay in touch with the people.
Yeah, that's right. It's working.
When?
No kidding?
Me?
Oxygen! I need some oxygen! This is major.
Excuse me, uh, what are you doing in there?
'scuse me. I uh, I was in here this morning and uh, I believe I paid you with a twenty dollar bill, (smiles) but you only gave me change for a ten.
When is it going to be my turn, Jerry? When do I get my 15 minutes? I want my 15 minutes!
I will not blow this.
Why not? What do I care?
Two theaters?
They're for protection, Jerry. Can you tell where I'm lookin'?
alright alright, I gotta buy some bread
And I'd like a discount.
That took awhile.
I thought you said he was gonna get a muffin.
So dont finish it.
And she didn't say something to you about a certain something?
(quietly) Ya.
I always look annoyed. Yeah, when you look annoyed all the time, people think that you're busy. Think about it... (acts annoyed for 3 seconds).
How' you doing?
Sure. I could go the tomato route. But eh, I've given this a lot of thought Jerry. All that frustration. Ill never get any work done. So Im doing a complete 360. Im going for total efficiency and ability.
So, how was the movie?
Yes.
(quietly) ehh. (pausing to look at both of them) So what made you change your mind?
Why didn't you just wear a heavier coat?
Hey.
NO!!
And, Ill have a club soda with no ice.
What about this weekend?
What did he give you for it.
Yeah. I'll pay for it.
Black and white?
The Rosses have started up a foundation, Jerry, and I have to sit on the board of directors.
(panicking) Right, I knew I felt something!
You won't regret this, sir.
So, Dad...
Well, she probably just assumed.
(thinking of the moans) Heh. (Karen takes another puff of her cigarette) You seem like you really enjoyed your Risotto. (chuckles) You have a very contented air over there. (chuckles again) You look very contented, very satisfied. (pauses) Are you satisfied?
Your hose! Where's your hose?!
Of course. But I really wanna leave my mark this time, you know, uh. I wanna walk away from the Yankees with people saying 'Wow! Now that guy got canned!'
(to Elaine) Right, alright. (to Jerry) Oh Jerry, do you have any apples?
Yeah, okay.
Hi. I-I really should be getting back to my fianc, you know, we, uh, we had this big fight yesterday and, uh, well she, she wants to-to know my secret code. I-I don't know, I can't tell her. The funny thing is, you know, I would really love to tell someone 'cause it's killing me. You uh, you wanna know what it is? It's Bosco. You know, the chocolate syrup? I love that stuff, I pour it in milk, it's my favorite drink. Hoo-hoo, boy, that is a relief!
(Yelling out) It's my apartment, Eldridge! The Stalkholm may not have sunk ya, but I will! Ha, ha, ha!
Well, lets just leave.
You don't want to suffer with this all weekend.
(to Kramer) This man is a genius. Genius!
Kramer, can we do this later..
So, uh, gentlemen, do we have a deal?
I could see that...
I don't think we should see each other anymore. You're great but I'm I'm riddled with personal problems.
Fired? Why?
Jerry said he didn't like it.
All right -- (Gets up to leave)
The security guard.
Yeah, here you go.
Maybe he's, um... mixed.
He got about uh, two inches from... there.
Hold on. Hold on. Wait a minute. How am I gonna get the rye bread into the apartment?
They? The Government?
Very exciting, very exciting, it's like watching a birth.
Oh that's OK, really, don't worry about it.
Come on, Im tired.
I'd get tired of it.
You think I'm going down?
Manhattan Memorial, less of a line.
All right. All right.
Good, let her think it.
Into the hole?
Yeah. Yeah. It's the only way. Come on. What are you, kidding me?
I got the job?
You're not really gonna go to California, are you?
Ah! See? I told ya.
They're breaking up? How do you know?
What choice do I have?
Hello?
(sitting) Newww tuxedo. For the Pinstripe Ball. Steinbrenner is throwing a huge party at Tavern on the Green, heh!
Who!!?
Nah, nah, it's uh, it's a long story. Just uh, try to get it up.
oh..
You know a lost and found could be a good idea.
Great. Seven-thirty, alright?
Why don't we get them a couch? (Kramer laughs) Well rent a U-haul -- well bring em a nice sectional.
(thoughtful) Downtown.
Nice nun.
Oh, they're busting!
Are you kidding? I lie every second of the day. My whole life is a sham!
Did you see the homeless guy on the library steps screaming obsenities and doing some calesthetics routine
(Threatening) Hold it! One more step and were walkin!
You know, I could have actually gone to that.
He's actually doing him a favor. It's less money for him to buy food.
Look, I'm gonna go to the bathroom...
No, stings the throat. Anyway, so I was coming along here, and I felt like a piece of cake, you know? But then I thought, it's morning, I should really have a muffin. I like those chocolate chip ones. Then I figured, well, they're really both cake. So I, uh, I sat on that bench for a little while, twenty minutes or an hour, and then I figured, check and see what you were up to. (a thought occurs to him) Wait a minute, wait a minute. The broad jump! The broad jump over the pothole on Eighty-sixth Street!
What do the Chinese have to gain by faking a cure for baldness?
My code?
Ho, ha, ho! Jerry Seinfeld's a funny guy!
Vandelay!
Tell him to open it.
Nah, he didn't have anything to do with it...
I'm not her boyfriend. I want to be her boyfriend.
Sorry, you don't know what's going on out there! (looks at Owen) Who's he?
Yeah!
Um, I don't uh, really think I can go.
Where does he come off?
Just put it on! All right now, remember she had her nails done today so remark how you like the color. And if you need me you beep me, all right. Here you go, hey, hey, hey, hey...(sprays Binaca into Jerry's mouth.) Go get'em you're a tiger!
Is it, uh, doable?
(mutters it again)
There's an easy move go from screwin' you behind your back to screwin' you right to your face.
Ill eh, Ill just have a bowl of chili.
Who's the Drake?
Like at the airport? (getting excited)
There was an incident. I'd rather not discuss it.
That's uh, KL5-8383. Are you calling them soon because, they keep very strange hours.
(triumph) Alright.
Kramer...
Right above you?
Well, I - I could, Uh, I could give the money back. Here. (Holds it out)
I dont know whatcha had to tell her that for. You put me in a very difficult position, Marine Biologist! I'm very uncomfortable with this whole thing.
(very worried) Uhm, I, I gotta go.
I told ya. Hey, any of you guys want to come out and help me fix my father's screen door in Queens?
That's where I come in. Umm, on splat. Uh, you see, Mrs. Sweedler, or is it hospital administrator Sweedler?
Want a bite?
Take it off. You're going to ruin it.
In the whole world right now, there's maybe three emergencies. Why would you think, on this entire planet, that you're one of those three?
I'm, uh, George Costanza. I was having dinner with your son.
Elaine, shut-up.
Kramer, I, I, I, uh, I need to talk to Jerry privately.
No, I can't. What if I meet a woman? I'd always be worried about that first moment where I'd take it off and see that look of disappointment on her face.
O.K., Danny, take a swing. (Tartabull swings the bat.) N-No! No! No! You're opening up your shoulder.
(Hangs up phone and pauses) this is great! He fired her! This is incredible, he fired her. I'm out, baby! I'm out!
Something's going on here.
(on the answering machine) Jerry, what's happening? Come on, pick up the phone.
(talking from bathroom) Witness?
I show up.
Ya
What do you mean you didn't think I wasn't gonna use them?!
Kramer?
Yes. Very nice to have had her to mention... (starting to leave)
Right
We're not stealing it.
That's a picture of me next to the coffin.
Yeah.
Looks like veal.
Jerry. Marla. (Realizing Jerry's cue) Stacey! (Walks over to Stacey)
(enthusiastic) And, you know, I do a lotta business with Japanese TV. They broadcast a lot of American baseball. They got an office here in New York!
Yes, but I still don't feel right about letting you into Kramer's apartment without his permission.
The same outfit?
Do me a favor would you? Would you change lanes? Would you get outta this lane. You gotta get out of this lane. This lane stinks. They're all double parked here Please get outta this lane. I'm beggin you please please.
I mean it's gotten to the point where I'm flirting with operators on the phone. I almost made a date with one.
You really think this looks O.K. on me?
Elaine, Julie.
You could take the IQ test for me. I could pass it to you out a window. We could do it, she lives in the first floor.
I'm sorry sir.
Funny guy, huh?
Of course it's cashmere.
Hey, Tim.
What are you kidding? We look great! You know what this pudding needs? The skin on the top, you know like your mother used to make it on the stove.
What kind of noodle do you want?
(thinking) Oh my God, it's 701. What have I done? My whole plan is depending on Kramer? Have I learned nothing? How could I make such a stupid mistake? He'll never show up!
Oh well, I hope he doesn't jum...
Why is what I do is so important? Why must I be always the focal point of attention? Let me just be, let me live.
All right, OK, I'm goin' in.
(pointedly) She could do a lot worse than Mr Peanut, my friend.
(to Jody) You're listening to this?
Yea, well, maybe some parts.
So, uh, you gonna see him again?
Speak now, or we are headed to the Hamptons. It's a two-hour drive. Once you get in that car, we are going all the way... to the Hamptons. All right, you wanna get nuts? Come on. Let's get nuts!
Yeah...(scratching his head) full.
Really? (Jerry shakes his head) Maybe this will become like a cool thing, living with your parents.
Kramer,
"Whhhoooo!!!!"(taps on his desk loudly)
Continue.
Not me. Everything should be negotiable. (he picks up a container of fruit)
I guess there are no small diseases, only small actors.
The shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy, shmmopy, shmoopy!
Are you through?
Reality tour?
Nooooooo......
I mean, I could understand if there was something else playing, but it's this or nothing.
I though we said we weren't going to discuss that now!
So you're a lawyer. What kind of cases do you handle?
OK, ah.. (George throws his keys on the table) see ya!
I think I can sum up the show for you with one word NOTHING.
Listen Sheila it's not what you think. I put my trust into the wrong person. He said the key word was tasteful.
"These pretzels are making me thirsty!!"
No, no, no potato man. Inka-dink.
(laughs) hu hu.
Look at where we are! (referring to the seat usher) He's not stopping! He just keeps going and going and going! (the usher abruptly stops at the second row) We're not in the first row?
She got that from you!
(Identifying what Jerry said) Clint Eastwood!
Oh, its from Les Miserables. I went to see it last week. I cant get it out of my head. I just keep singing it over and over. It just comes out. I have no control over it. Im singin it on elevators, buses. Im singin it in front of clients. Its taken over my life.
I was just wondering what it was you wanted for dessert.
I, uh, oh, broke a shoelace today.
Why not?
Sure. You know, Rhisa. I've always found you... very attractive.
Must be hell living in that house.
good thing I asked
Yeah.
Yeah. Hmm. Boy these really do pinch. I tell you, if I ever find the son of a bitch that stole my glasses...
Where are you sitting?
What did they do for toilet paper in the civil war?
How's this for criticism? Um...you stink. How do like that criticism? You know what's funny to me? That diploma up on the wall. That is my idea of "com-med-dee"! You sitting here, telling people what to do.
You faked?
You'll pay? I'm there.
What?
What are you, a doctor?
Yes, two solariums. Quite a find. And I have horses, too?
I guess she did. He's gone, now I'm the man.
Oh!
Kimbrough.
Really?
Well, that's not offensive. (Reflects) It's abnormal, but it's not offensive.
Well, this is the Jerry Seinfeld that only I know. I can't believe I just told you that.
I didn't have any sex.
You go over there -
Yeah. Me too.
Why don't they have salsa on the table?
You nervous?
ALL RIGHT!!
(To Jerry) Let me ask you something.. How much do you think it would cost to have tonsils and adenoids removed in the hospital?
What's gonna happen? They can't kill us.
(to Jerry) Dont you find that strange?
Walked around? And you looked?
It wasn't down in, it was sort of on top.
Oh, the busboy left the menu a little close to the candle.
No wait, you can't just leave me here! Will I see you again?
I can't believe this! What was wrong with it? What didn't you like about it?
Because great couples always have a great story about how they met. That's why I've never been in a long term relationship. I've never had a good meeting story.
When she goes to the bathroom.
(Runs over to him, not wanting him to leave) What? You're going?
Kramer! You can't go! Who's gonna do the feats of strength?
All right, all right ( Goes to the bathroom)
Yeah.
(Ironing) You don't wanna know.
So you're gonna let me get suspended for shower urination?
(Stops) Oh right, the blind date.
I'm not going if he's going.
The cashier is at lunch - which is where Id like to be.
Oh, Schumann. Of course.
Yeah. I did some shopping. Some new clothes shopping. (turns to a man) Can I borrow your menu?
Yeah. Just confirming.
(acting disappointed) Oh, please don't.
Oh, yeah.
How do you feel? Confident?
She had an itch. She could have used any one of those fingers. That finger was meant for me.
Yeah. Why, what do you do?
Yeah, no pop-in, no "in the neighborhood," no "I saw your light was on." And the best part is, if things go really well...
I can't drive?
Yeah, the super glossy. The best they had.
Listen to this. Marcy comes up and she tells me her ex-boyfriend was over late last night, and "yada yada yada, I'm really tired today." You don't think she yada yada'd sex.
Pepe.
So...
I'm going straight to hell, no two ways about it.
All right, Dad, we're five blocks from the house. Sit sideways.
Yeah, with crutches everyone has questions.
What's that.
Oh, would ya stop worrying?
No.
I've coupled! I've coupled!
Yeah, there was a fire in my apartment.
Yeah, I never know what's going on there.
(dramatically) A what?
(coming back in) Alright, alright. Can we go out and eat?
Well I would eat you.
They made me buy it.. A hundred bucks this thing cost me. (Gesturing to the book) How dare they?! I got news for you, if it wasn't for the toilet, there would be no books.
Yes, yes! The punishment should fit the crime.
Jerry, the Mets lost.
Jerry...
I tried to tell you, but you wouldnt listen. No, ho, ho! You were gonna get a deal, huh? Theres no laws in this place. Anything goes! Its Thunderdome!
Goldfish.
Why not? It's a good look for a woman.
Right now?
(looking at his watch) I really should get going. Y'know, I..I wanna be home in case Neil calls.
Wh.. Where you going?
Hey! (heads toward bathroom)
Yeah, my wife couldnt make it today. Shes got something with her mother... Who knows whats going on with her. Dont let any one kid you, its tough.
Well, cause we were just saying we were going to ask you to come up to the country with us this weekend. Susan's father has a cabin up there. But, eh, all right, well.
yes?
Yes, I, uh, I need to return this book.
Yeaah, beautiful... (They try to hit a high five, but George hits Elaine in the forehead.) Sorry...
Oh, no no no. I pay what I say.
What was the tallest woman you ever slept with?
Obviously.
He's getting phone calls here now? (he's standing near the counter and eating chips out of a big bag)
Yeah, but they let me go on and on all about the Hamptons, they never said a thing! You don't let somebody lie when they know you're lying. You call them a liar!
Sure, well uh, you know I'll check in with you next week uh, I gotta run now because I got a full plate this afternoon. All right, really go to uh,.
Bring it on, baby
(grabbing lapels) J. Crew.
So did you enjoy your lunch?
(To Jane) You know, when I was a kid, I once found a dollar and fifty cents in change on the bottom of the pool.
And you're watching the fight at Jerry's?
Alright, just forget it.
A knife?
Is that the lovely Mrs. Morgan?
No, no. Deena, it's not what you think.
Ah ha, well, I really wouldn't know about that. I don't watch much TV. I like to read. So what do you do, a lot of that "did you ever notice?" this kind of stuff.
Oh, no, thanks. I cant drink coffee late at night, it keeps me up.
Nothing.
Happy? Why should I be happy?
Who am I going to meet who is better than her? No one, Jerry. No one's better than her.
She had to be impressed by that conversation, had to! It was a great performance. I am unbelievable on the phone. On the date they should just have two phones on the table at the restaurant, done.
Good.
Well, Steven, I, uh.. (All the sudden, a small gang steps out of nowhere, surrounding George)
Well, after dinner last week, she invites me back to her apartment.
And I love you, Marisa.
Never! It is a part of me. I will just return the chair, and it will be easy, because the receipt is in my good friend.
I've matured.
It's George.
Who?
Why shouldn't I?
All right, All right, all, right!!( gives the headphones to Kramer) How you gonna find out who this is?
It's not the same.
Ah, listen ah, I don't mean to bother you but ah, silly me, I- I think I may have left my hat in your apartment. So ah, I thought I'd just come by later and pick it up.
My Susan?
This'll only take a second.
Yeah, is he still mad at you for crashing his Thanksgiving party?
(adamant) Yes I am. I defy you to come up with a better name than Seven.
How many tickets are you paying today?
What if it felt good?
(hitting Cynthia playfully with a napkin) Stop it, stop it.
Oh. Ha. They are my keys, how weird. (laughs)
She, uh, went shopping for some shoes for the wedding and, yada yada yada, I'll see her in six to eight months. (Kramer and Julie enter)
You know, we're living in a society! We're supposed to act in a civilized way.
Hunh, pph (raises hands slightly, in amazement) How was it?
Huh?
All right. Well, we'll see what happens to you.
That's what they tell me!
Where did you get those socks?
What actress does she remind you of?
A plane crash? A Heart attack? Lupus? Is it Lupus?
Bozo?
But she didn't know he doesn't recycle.
I take an eye test; I flunk it, the next thing you know I am swinging to the sweet sounds of risk management.
Oh, that's funny
Well, I can see that. What do you have to do that for? Who cares about your pants size?
She's working late that night. We're - were supposed to have dinner with everybody at eight o'clock so I'll set up the ride for seven o'clock.
I'm gonna go meet Danielle. (grabs his coat) There's a new Neil in town! (triumphant laughter) Hahaha!
Until that stupid photo jogs his memory.
Oh, great.
Wa.. He doesn't have to tell her.
Yes. I like to feel cozy. I have a very small apartment. I like to feel tucked in, nestled in. Love to be nestled.
You see, It's right here. It's all white...
Check, please.
Well, I know when I'm a little strapped, I sometimes drop off my rent check having forgotten to sign it. That could buy us some time.
That guy is not blind.
(entering Jerry's apartment) Jerry?
I'm losin' it
Jerry! I need you to get another picture of man-hands. I'm beggin' you!
Come on. Come on. Come on. Yeah. Yeah. (grunting)
A woman that hates me this much comes along once in a lifetime.
Alright, just keep the hat!
"Hey you know , I felt we had like a synergy out there,you know, like we were really helping each other."
Your idea?
Be careful, you're getting blood all over the car.
He's actually doing him a favor. It's less money for him to buy food.
Attention Steinbrenner and front-office morons! Your triumphs mean nothing. You all stink. You can sit on it, and rotate! This is George Costanza. I fear no reprisal. Extension five-one-seven-oh.
A little notice would've helped! How many people?
Yes yes yes This is unbelievable.
Well, we're collectors. We, uh, see objects of great beauty and, uh, we must have them.
Yeah haha.
Oh. Okay, here it is, I got it. She lost her thumbs in a tractor accident and they grafted her big toes on. They do it every day.
Fragile Frankie Merman? I never liked that guy.
There's no Gammy.
Yeah...
"Sir?"
Are you through?
(on the answering machine) Jerry, it's George. Hey, hey are you all set for the weekend. This is going to be great. You're going to have a great time with Naomi.
Yes, yes I am.
Jerry, please?
No, I want to go.
Well she apologized, and then she wanted to know if we could get together Wednesday afternoon.
Yes faddah.
Oh great.
So, uh, how long has this been going on?
Hey, Mr Lazzari.
It's "ooh" As in "ooh ooh ah ah."
Marla.
[embarrassed pause] ``Rochelle, Rochelle''.
He uh...doesn't have any running water?
Yeah
Let me ask you a question. Who would win in a fight between you and me?
Okay, Okay. Who do you think you're talking to? What are ya' you trying to make a joke, because it's not funny. I can tell you that.
I didn't get the job?
Officer, he can't pull in head first.
I won't be able to, concentrate in front of you.
Ha, because I love Drakes Coffee Cake.
See now that bothers me even more than dying bothers me, cause it's people like you who live to be a hundred and twenty because you're not bothered by it. How could it not bother you?
Elaine, Elaine, Elaine, Elaine...(distant alarm sound which is getting louder.)
No, no the full size.
All right, shes not even gonna ask, if we see her, which is remote.
Elaine you don't understand. I had 103 temperature when I bought that sweater. I was so dizzy I was seeing red dots everywhere. I thought everything in the store had a red dot on it. I couldn't distinguish one red dot from another. I couldn't afford anything. I have nothing. I haven't worked for a really long time. (Jerry is standing right behind George. Jerry takes out a hankerchief and starts fake-crying in it.) I mean look, I have no clothes, look at what I'm wearing. It's just a little red dot.
I can't believe I didn't push for this sooner.
Would I want to see what Mary Todd wore to Lincoln's funeral?
Well what's in this giant box out in the hall?
Hey Fred.
What happened to your itch?
Oh, n-no comparison.
Maybe I can get her locked up.
Hawaii?
No good?
Yeah. Actually it was in gym class. I was trying to climb the ropes and Jerry was spotting me. I kept slipping and burning my thighs and then finally I slipped and fell on Jerry's head. We've been close ever since.
(contemptuously, imitating Altons voice) Hes in the bathroom.
Very curious.
Well perhaps, not to the extent that you are. But I know the basic plot. Yeah.
I gotta go.
Huh. Really?
Well, it's a good looking piece of meat. (laughs nervously) Wow, this is some place. A duplex, huh? (indicating) Look at this, you got stairs in an apartment. All my life, I dreamed about having steps in an apartment. Even one step. Sunken living room. Although, one step is really not all that sunken. (tries hard to elicit a laugh)
You are a good friend. You know what? Even if you killed somebody I wouldn't turn you in.
Of Course I'm telling the truth.
Hi Amy, I'm George.
Ill be right here.
Koko.
(George puts on the headphones) Oh! my god...
"HEY! JIMMY!!! ha ha ha........Great game."
She knows that I have her clock. I know that she has my hat. I think she's getting ready to make an exchange.
What do you mean?
Could she do that at Kruger?
Give me two bucks. Ill do it for two bucks.
Jerry, it's me, George, don't worry, I'll return it
The one with the long sideburns?
All right we got the wine. Aren't we lucky? We got wine. Whoopee Whoa! Imagine if we didn't bring the wine. We'd be shunned by society. Outcasts! WHERE'S YOUR WINE? GET OUT!
How much you pay this maid?
Nice meeting you.
I'll take care of this, Danny.
Oh my God. I just remembered where I left my retainer in second grade. I'll see ya. (He throws finished Rubik's cube to Jerry and he exits. Kramer enters)
She might be leaving to work any minute.
Excuse me Ms. which street are we on?
We, uh, we go on foot from here.
What?
The Bubble Boy!
Oh, you are such a wuss.
When are they leaving for Paris?
(thinking she means the breasts) What!!
My parents are moving to Florida!
Great! I ate the entire platter! Had to call in sick today.
Oh, sure, my Black Hawks jacket. I love my Black Hawks jacket.
(George is telling a story. Karen is laughing and she seems to be the only one to find him funny) So I go into this clothing store and the saleswoman is wearing this (whistling) low cut thing. So I said to her "Can I ask you a question? When you put on a top like that, what's your tought process? What's going on in your mind?"
Amazing. I drive them to lesbianism, he brings 'em back.
So she starts vaccuming, back and forth, back and forth, her hips swivelling, her breasts, uh... (trying to think of a word)
I don't know, I have to call her, tell her where we are. I'm very lucky she's even considering seeing me at all.
Well what would be the point of that?
Bert... Har... bin... son. Bert Har-bin-son.
Well, what was I supposed to do? Get out of the shower, put on my bathrobe? Go all the way down to the other end? Come all the way back?
Regards?
Excuse me. Are you using your catsup?
Who gets picked off in softball? Its unheard of.
That's exactly my point.
Got it.
Yeah. There's something wrong with that? I'm a character. People are always saying to me, "You know you're a quite a character."
What do you think?
Hey, you know, there's this secretary at work that always had a crush on me.
Um, cream soda?
My little man doesn't know.
Tennis courts? W-w-what about the yard? Where do they have the gang fights?
Who?
Oh, I pleaded with him.
I know.
(Muttering) Susan has the doll collection.. one of the dolls looks exactly like my mother.. she likes to sleep with it.
Right, your friend Roy.
Yeah.( reaches for the purse and finds a piece of paper . he looks annoyed.
We've just been through this! You don't remember? We just had this exact same conversation a minute ago!
(angry) Stickin' it!
Dr. Sitarides don't go! Oh, thanks Jerry!
Well what if I told you I'm thinking of moving here?
So she's just sitting there, she's having a pleasant conversation... and all of a sudden.
The next thing you know, he'll have you driving him to the airport..
You guys ever shot anybody?
Hehehehehe (higher tone laugh, though still quietly )
(Somewhat angered) She's in traction.
"Quite a workout"? What did you say?
I was throwing up all night. It was like my own personal Crying Game.
Gimme half!
(getting animated) Yeah. Yeah. You know the odds of me being anyone's type?! I have never been anyone's type, but apparently, this Marisa Tomei loves funny, quirky, bald men.
(starts to try to get passed Jerry and Elaine) Alright get out of my way. (Jerry and Elaine push him back, George very annoyed) Alright don't make me get physical here!
(Standing in the doorway) I'm fine with it! Fi-hi-hi-hine I say! (Leaves)
It's a bit hilly - no?
Ho, ho, ho, good dog, good dog...
Name tags! Name tags! What kind of an idiot thinks anybody would be interested in an idea like that.
I can't carry any changes in these pants, it falls out.
Hey Elaine, does Tony like peanut butter?
(Holding out his arms - giving praise) It's beautiful. Now, what do I say?
I knew this was gonna happen some day. It was inevitable. I've known it ever since I was a little kid. I've been waiting for it.
like that (looking at Jerry)
Uh, let me ask you something. You uh, you ever hear of Marisa Tomei?
'Cause I shaved yesterday in the afternoon.
Maybe we could call them and ask them to return it.
Oh, I don't think you want to do that.
Y'know, I'm better with the mothers than I am with the daughters.
Oh, right! (Shakes her hand) Right! Hey, hey.. I love the floors in here. It's like a gymnasium in here! Try and guard me! (Dribbles an imaginary ball
Well, I'm also an architect. Is that pastrami?
What are you doing here?
We cant just let him get away with this.
Because you called her by the wrong name.
Good.
I knew you had an appointment.
Okay, what about a nice frame? With a picture of another guy in it. Frame says I care for you, but if you wanna get serious, perhaps you'd be interested in someone like this.
What are you talking about?
Gotta go.
(leaving) Hah. Good luck.
Pasta primavera.
Oh, you're dead.
Hey. (pointing at him) Corbin Bernsen.
No, no, no, this suit is not for sale. (tries to take off the suit from the guy)
I hope so. I can't take him living with me much longer. He makes this kasha, it stinks up the whole house.
What??
All right, it wouldn't kill me.
I'm the assistant to the travelling secretary. I'm going on the road trips with 'em! I'll be on the plane... I'm working in Yankee Stadium! This is a dream, I'm busting, Jerry, I'm busting!
After consummation.
She missed her period? Oh my god. I can't believe it! I'm a father! I did it! My boys can swim! I can do it! I can do it!
(answers phone, good mood) Hey.
Yeah.. (Trying to remember) Poverotti.. Domingo.. and.. uh.. the other guy.
You sure?
'Things'll be great, when you're...'
Just take the cap off!
(Getting in a more panicked state) Oh God, Mommy!
(getting irritated) He's an importer-exporter. Okay?
(Jerry-style) That's a shame.
You ditched me. That's twice. Now I demand to know what's going on!
(excited) Yeah, the pilot!
Greetings, people. Greetings. Greetings and salutations. What a beautiful day for a ball game. Let's play two! (Sits down, says to waitress ) Oh, I'll have the chicken salad on rye, my usual, you know what I get, darlin'. (Turns to the Gang) So, let's see, I had a little conversation today with Mr Don Mattingly - (to Elaine) he's the first base man.
"George likes spicy chicken."
He frolfs, he scores...(he drops one invitation on the stairs.)
They are made from lycra-spandex.
So ... uh, squirrel.
Si, si.
(penny drops) Oh, uh, wait a minute, wait a minute. (snorts) Is this about money?
Well just take an overview. Can't you just take an overview?
Hey.
Yeah. Cotton breathes, you see, it's much softer. Imagine playing games and your team is five degrees cooler than the other team. Don't you think that would be an advantage? They're cooler, they're more comfortable...they're happier - they're gonna play better.
What's a three letter word for candy?
Oh, I got it.
How's it going?
(sarcastically) Thats funny. Youre a funny guy.
When Lupe makes up the beds in the morning.
It's alright, I got lunch.
millions and millions
What?
Oh (snorts) Articulate....Me? I've never articulated anything, i'm completely incoherent.
She ate breakfast naked?
What, you think I'm doing material here?
Ponce de Leon? Okay. (to Jerry) You sure you don't wanna go?
Officer, could I just explain something to you?
Hey.
Oh. Sorry.
Na no, I'm not good in these situations. I can't hide my pity. I..I make em feel worse.
Where you going?
Why?
Hey, where you going?
Excuse me, uh I couldn't help but notice that you were looking in my direction.
(to the executives) Excuse me. Did you hire the Sunshine Carpet Cleaners?
(crouches too) What? Where? Where?
OH!!!! What are you, crazy?! Are you, crazy?!
I know what you were trying to do. Nobody does it better than me.
Why do you have to be so suspicious of every one. This is a great man Zeng Zau, he wants to help bald people.
Why is the mailman wearing a bucket?
What about accommodations?
And you really believe this guy doesn't want to have kids.
I think he should wear whatever tie he wants.
Wa, uh, ...
(worked up) Wha...You gotta be kidding me?!
Yeah, well I'm thinking about getting out of town with Susan for a few days....Her parents rebuilt the cabin!
Important step. Maybe the most important.
Yes! 860,000. I can't believe it's still standing. No one has beaten me in like 10 years.
No, but um I have very good report with women, very good, comfortable. And from the first time I laid eyes on a brassieres, I was enthralled.
I don't think I could do it. You know, they always remember the first time. I don't want to be remembered. I wanna be forgotten.
All right, all right, calm down, calm down. Whatever happened in the past is past.
(gasping) I think I swallowed a fly! I swallowed a fly! What do I do? (He turns to a coffee shop patron at the counter.) What can happen?!
I want you to have this job. Of course...
No, it's, it's his. (indicates Jerry)
Oh, this is my friend, Jerry Seinfeld. I just bumped into him around the corner. Isnt that a coincidence? The funny thing is, I see him all the time.
So, um, you've read "The Big Game", have you?
I called it.
Who?
That is an opening.
Because, you're not a dermatologist.
Why? Maybe she liked me. I, I mean she was looking right at me. You know, I think she was impressed. You know, we had good eye contact the whole meeting.
(sitting down) Vacation?
Yeah, well, they're my socks!
Why not?
Wha?
Uh, we're cool. Everything's cool (to security attendent)
Would a giant rubber ball work?
What's the difference you just read it and mail it right back. These we'll do.
Maybe this is what the pilot should be about, vomiting on somebody's vest.
Dolores!
I'm gonna read a book. From beginning to end. In that order.
That's a very good question. You know she and I go out for dinner, she doesn't even reach for the check. That?s all I?m asking for is a reach. Is that so much to ask for?
(pointedly) Oh, I'm sorry, I require twenty-four hours notice for a cancellation. Now, as I see it, you owe me seventy-five dollars.
I know. I know.
Alright, thanks a lot.
And isn't it more fun using the urinal?
She's like a district attorney. If it's not the truth, I'll break under the cross. I actually have to do it.
So she doesn't want to see me anymore.
If anything happens here, can I count on you?
I am not O'Brien! I am not O'Brien! I'm not O'Brien! Ask anyone! Jerry?! Jerry?!!
Newspaper.
Yes.
You know, the uh...(mutters it again.)
Diane DeConn? You saw Diane DeConn!
You're making more than I am.
You've never seen this before?
Oh!, he he, It was unbelievable
What are all sweatin' for?
Well, I'm gonna go back there later and return it when there's different people working.. You want to catch a movie?
How could anybody be so selfish and inconsiderate!
So she's gorgeous.
Hi, Elaine.
Thank you very much. (Walks out)
(bursting out of the bathroom, fumbling with his fly) Button fly! Why do they put buttons on a fly? It takes ten minutes to get these things open!
Well that's the gist of it!
Fortunately, yes.
Jerry! Up here!
What do you mean?
he's the first cool guy I've ever been friends with in my whole life. You know.. it's a different world when you're with a cool guy, he's not afraid of anybody. You should hear the way he talks to waitresses.. he gets free pie!
How do you know? What if pig-man had a two-seater?
Quick. Get this thing back in the pizzeria
Yes it is.
My heart! My heart! (To Assistant) Where you going? Are you crazy?!
I can't do these puzzles.
Can't leave the car here!
So... Can I have it?
(Defensively loud) It was when I was banging!
(Silently squinches his mouth and nods at Kramer)
(fever pitch) Marisa Tomei's sitting home, Elaine! Wh..why didn't you tell me that Katy was friends with Marisa Tomei?!
Shut up!
Oh, I just, uh, leased a house out in the Hamptons, and I have got to get out there this weekend and sign the papers.
She made a big breakfast every Sunday. I don't know what she put in those eggs.
(clears throat) Maura, I, uh- I want you to know... I-I've given this a lot of thought. I'm sorry, but... we, uh, we have to break up.
Yes, I agree. I hope my parents go long before I do.
No, no, no we'll talk about it later.
Yeah, yeah I really had some guts back then. Why don't we do it again?
Is that how you're gonna say it?
I-I wasn't in the attic.
Oh, share.
Really?
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm terribly sorry.. (Bends down, and starts picking up her things)
(smiling expectantly) Here it comes.
Why don't you see someone about it?
You're *selling* the car!?
You see, my friend here, his aunt passed away last night.
(In a state of hysteria) I'm an eggplant! I'm an eggplant! I'm a minstrel man!
No! No. It's not good, I don't think so.
Yeah, yeah. Speaking of crazy, did you hear about Lloyd Braun?
It's George.
You know, sometimes those guys don't make it back. (Looks in fridge) I'm really hungry.
An idea for the show.
Yeah! Look at me! I was free and clear! I was living the dream! I was stripped to the waist, eating a block of cheese the size of a car battery!
Vandelay? The judge's name is Vandelay?
(On his way out) Heh, heh, heh. Thats what they want you to think.
What?
Of course.
They're making their decision today.
That's him over there. The one that looks like a blowfish.
Yes, she wants me to like her, if she likes me. But she doesnt like me!
You know, it's very impolite to tell secrets. Are you talking about me?
Huh? You know? Spring. Rejuvenation. Rebirth. Everything's blooming. All that crap.
I have an idea.
Look...humm..I'm on with Beijing with the hair restauration clinic. Could you talk to them for me and tell them I'd like to place an order.
She invites me up at twelve oclock at night, for coffee, and I dont go up. No thank you. I dont want coffee. It keeps me up. Too late for me to drink coffee. I said this to her. People this stupid shouldnt be allowed to live. I cant imagine what she must think of me.
Thank you very much. (Peggy leaves the menus and walks away) So guess what I got do tomorrow?
So we jump and roll, you won't get hurt.
No seriously...
I just thought it would be nice. A little variety.
Don't you see what this says? How can you possibly like somebody ,if you think they look like this?
I'll tell you what happened. I bet he got the AM/PM mixed-up.
Why?
I'll fake an illness. (Acts it out) My back! My back! I can't believe, my back.
Oh no you didn't. Get out, when?
All right there you go. It's a '47 cabin all right. So, we'll see you tomorrow.
(Watching the mechanic leave) I know about the vein! I cant believe this guy..
Elaine and her sponges...she's got like, a war chest full of them.
Alright, alright, I'll go on the date, but that's that.
Kramer...
Hey
My receipts! The chair! My tiger poster!
That's why I peeked. (Jerry opens the door to take some trash out, and meets Kramer and Gail in the hallway.)
(to salesman) Well, maybe you could show me something else.
Anyway, I don't even get a thank you. I don't get it!
Course, I wouldn't, I mean uh, the guy is uh, well obviously (to Cynthia, as she passes) the guy has his problems.
Let's work on the card.
Oh, what? What? That? Are you kidding? I didn't quit. What? You took that seriously?
Oh, yeah I'm sure he loves to hear from fans in the locker room.
(coughs) I've always smoked.
Uh, yes, uh...you don't know me, my name is George Costanza...did you happen to rent Breakfast At Tiffany's?
Yea bye.
Oh mother of God.
Just one? I'm living like twenty. (chuckles) What's yours?
So what? Thats good.
Do you hear that?
About the pizza?
(to Kramer) What about your stuff?
Yeah?
Well, it was slightly used...
Yeah you made it, how about that.
Were really glad for you.
This week. My father got a deal from a friend of his. It's Gore-Tex. You know about Gore-Tex?
Yes. Why, is that so inconceivable?
You going to the party?
You know, I'm sorry, I...I hate to be one of those people, but we're right in the middle of this thing...I can't hear.
(gritting teeth) Yeah, sure.
Right.
I know. This was like a record. My previous record was when Joni Hirsch asked me not to tell anybody that we slept together. Kept a lid on that for about 28 seconds.
You do know Kramer?
Should I leave this..?
No, no, no... Just a *tiny* bit... It's not even *frontal* nudity. It's... *sidal* nudity...
I told her the truth.
Yeah, she's a sweet ride.
(Still standing) So, you're gonna sit there?
Well you know there is an unusual number of people in this country having sex with AMPUTEES! (grabs the forum from Kramer and walks over to the clerk) . . . Penthouse forum, newspaper, gum, Clark Bar.
Thank you very much. Dylan?
"I have to go see Steinbrenner later. Mr Wilhelm told him that I was the one responsable for stealing all the merchandise."
All Simons was able to find out is that hes in the hospital.
Uh, Tim, the pencil...
Oh, yeah?
Fish. What do they do?
Alright! Please, please! I cannot have this constant bickering!.. Stress is very damaging to the epidermis! Now, I have an important photo session in the morning - my hands have got to be in tip-top shape, so please - keep the television down, and the conversation to a minimum.
Tarragon? Oh, you're crazy.
I dunno they said maybe.
Tell me about the free facial.
Alright, Jerry, I'm gonna get my coat.
He's an importer.
(coming back to the table from the bathroom) Oh uh. You ready?
Salsa is now the number one condiment in America.
he he (laughs)
How could she leave us alone with this lunatic? Ten more minutes, and thats it! Im leaving. I have to tell you, this guy scares me.
You know what I never understood? Why did they change the siren noise? When I was a kid it was always "waaaa, waaaa", you know now it "woo-woo-woo-woo-woo". Why did they do that, did they do some research? Did they find that woo-woo was more effective than waa?
I can't tell ya now , he's gonna be back in a ten seconds.
Oh, I could do it.
Alright, look, you want to be in?
(Disappointed) A frog?
You can't tell him the truth, you're gonna blow the whole thing.
What are you doing? You're robbing me?
What?
Ah! Peggy. Good to see you.
Hey, I brought you some cigarettes. You buy yourself something nice.
Hey, you like?
Elaine, I once told a woman that I coined the phrase, "Pardon my French."
They're not here! You cost me fifty bucks!
Will they give us cash?
Yes, good to see you, too. And Good luck with, uh... with the whole thing, there.
You bought non-refundable tickets, you idiot!
Yes, yes. Very smooth, super smooth. No, but I really wanna attack this thing, you know. Sink my teeth into it. So I was just wondering... what do you think would be the very best way to get started?
A-and don't settle for 145, you can do better, you're a genius. Heheheh (laughs)
She kept such a nice clean apartment. She was so sanitary.
You should have somebody take a look at that.
You don't think I can?
Yup, y'know, they really spruce up the apartment.
ha Ha..
Well, I still don't know what I'm supposed to do. I don't even know what my assignment is.
I just talked to Mr. Kruger, he'll be down in a minute. He wanted me to take a photograph for the record.
What?
It wasn't funny.
Claire, Claire, youre a woman, right?
We'll take it!
(After looking in the bag) The pea pods? All you saved was the pea pods? (Kramer enters)
Where's the luck? There's no luck. 1,900 dollars down the drain.
We could be zipping all over the place.
Yeah, you gotta watch for the jellyfish.
I have to have my tonsils taken out.
I don't know what Newman wanted to see me for.
Did they take anything?
Yeah, hell be looking at us like hes backstage at a puppet show.
Pay phone in L.A., look it's a miracle.
I got your calzones Mr. Steinbrenner.
What are you doing?...She had those nuts in her mouth, she just spit them out.
What are you gonna do?
Well, you got no place to go. I'll tell you what your problem is You brought your queen out too fast. What do you think? She's one of these feminists looking to get out of the house? No, the queen is old fashioned. . Likes to stay home. Cook. Take care of her man. Make sure he feels good.
Can I come upstairs, please? (Elaine pushes the button and lets George in.)
Oh my god.
See?
Well Dad's been planning this for such a long time, he bought a new blanket, and he got tha...that game with foam paddles and the velcro ball. (laughs)
I don't know, I was starving Jerry!
How would I know?
Did you tell her anything?
Superman's father on Krypton.
Its Martine. I think hes dying. He tried to kill himself with pills.
Yes, sir, that was a good sandwich, sir.
No.
Yeah, I'm gonna let it go.
Hi.
(desperate) Steinbrenner had me committed! I'm in the nuthouse!
Is it a clockwise swirl?
And this is the first you're seeing of the coat?
No! No.
Well I like Dylan.
Your parents are going to Paris right?
Where the hell is your father?!
I know, I know. Listen, your stuff has to be done by now, why dont you just see if its dry?
I cant believe what Im hearing.
Let me see the watch.
This is a guy I know.. Kramer.
She's got everything, right? (counts on his fingers) She's intelligent, she's smart, she's got a great sense of humour.
Oh, I can't believe you're dropping out, too. So now Kramer and I have to pay for the entire gift?
It's Mickey Mantle, Jerry. My idol.
You heard him.
Ahhhhh...
A table right here.
(let down) So, that's it?
I mean, you've seen her, right?
Okay.
I did?
Absolutely. Pending approval of the script.
Ahh! (closes his eyes and rolling his head back) Umh!
Oh, he'll be here. By the way, Elaine, (reaches under the table and brings out a large coffee machine) thank you for laying out for the Arabian mocha java.
Nobody's faking.
Yeah, I mentioned Simons. Next thing I know, Im in the parking lot. Perhaps they had some sort of a falling out. Ill tell you one thing. I dont know what hes got. But for a sick guy, hes very strong.
Nothing except Prognosis Negative.
Kramer!! Kramer no!!
Rid? Nah, c'mon, the word is 'care'. Care. I care about your comfort, be it here in Queens or twelve-hundred miles away.
(animated) Are you insane? Jerk store, woulda smoked that guy! Smoked him, I say.
Look, I guarantee she won't know.
Birthday card?
I told her we'd all go out afterwards, okay? And don't applaud when she stops playing the first time. It's not over yet.
(spins his chair back to face her) So you got a $25,000 a year raise.
Okay. That's what we know.
tsh (snorts) Ah, yeah, we've - we've talked . . . I believe I can speak for the both of us on this.
Well you know what happens with larvae hatch, they-they're everywhere.
Okay. Uh, my mother is is going to pay for the sessions. ... Oh,Elaine?
Ok, thanks.
(Puts his arms in the air, stretching, and covers his mouth with an arm) Could you ask her, just ask her. If she says no, case closed.
I didn't even know it was a job.
He's a wig master
Oh, man, it's spinach! I've been walking around like this all afternoon.
Ha ha ha ha, oh all right, go ahead, deride, deride if you must. But let me tell you something, with my personality and this set of hair, you know what I am now? I am in the game. I no longer defer to the coifed. I'm a player.
Psst, You're telling me.
Ladies and gentlemen, this (Opens the door, Steven is standing there) is Steven Koren. His G.P.A. is a solid 2.0! Right in that meaty part of the curve - not showing off, not falling behind.
You wanted to see me, Mr. Steinbrenner?
Did you pass your stone yet?
Kramer.
You better call her.
Aunt Baby.
(on phone) . It's George Costanza. . are there any messages for me? Why does Mr. Steinbrenner want to see me in his office? . . . Communist? I'm not a Communist . . . . All right, all right. All right, I'll be there. - ( hangs up ) My secretary Ada, told Mr Steinbrenner I'm a Communist Now he wants to see me in his office.
Im the judge and the jury, pal. And the verdict is guilty!
No, of course not.
Yeah. Well, maybe not Elaine.
You're kidding? Somebody else got killed?
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I am aware!
Exactly, you know what I'm talking about, right?
They have no friends.
That's insulting! Ted Danson makes eight hundred thousand dollars an episode.
Payroll project. Wilhelm? Big uh, big payroll project.
Exactly.
I wonder if thats really true.
Will you marry me?
Volunteer work, huh?
(opening door) It's a big night. I'm, uh, ice skating with one, and going to a staged reading of "Godspell" with the other.
You went for the big "E".
How can I take it?
When I asked him if it was cancer, he didn't give me a "get outta here". That's what I wanted to hear "Cancer? Get outta here?"
What are you doing here? I thought you said you hated Isabella's?
(Pleading) You gotta let me go over there.
Uh, can we cut to the chase?
No.
Here you go.
No! No! Turn it off! No feats of strength! (Gets up and starts running out of the coffee shop) I hate Festivus!
Hehummm , Yeah!
I was seven and a half.
Never said goodbye. Never apologized. Nothing.
Oh, o.k., yeah. Where am I gonna park here...? (Pulls over.)
Oh, the hamstrings fine.
Oh I was not. The BUBBLE BOY was tried to kill me.
It's not that I want to keep talking about it? just think that the subject should resolve itself based on its own momentum.
(Laughs) You, I guess, you don't remember me.. but we actually, kind of um.. went out.. a couple of years ago.. once.. remember?
Let me just call him.
What are you, Bud Abbott? What are you callin me an idiot?
I havent seen it yet, but its a two-bedroom, its on the uh, west 83rd, bout a half block from the park?
Oh, no, no--
I am?
Okay, look, Audrey, before you take the bandage off just remember that I was the one that encouraged you to do this, you know? Now that you're gonna be a great beauty, let's not forget how this all began. You know, like if you'd listened to your friend, Elaine,
Payroll? No, no, I haven't done that.
Who?
How would you like a 'Hare Krishna' fist on your throat, you little punk?
Those were her exact words, I like George.
What?!
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas! (Co-worker gives a gift to George) Oh, Sandy! Here is a little something for you.. (hands her a card)
You're not goin to do it? What do you mean, You're not goin to do it?
He's an importer-exporter.
Well, it's just a game. Remember that, kids.
(chases after her) Wait a minute! You're--now you're getting a divorce because she's from Long Island?!?!
Oh yeah.
Hi! Mr. West, this is my friend Elaine--
(dials) Hi, are you OK? no, no,.. huh, (hangs up) She hung up.
Nine. Thirt... thirteen's no good.
I slipped on the invitations...how's the towels?
No, you see? You got greedy.
I'm not paying $500 for this! It's a piece of junk!
This is very exciting. The inner sanctum.
Yeah, this is my first time here. (nudges Jerry again)
W-What? What?
This is unprecedented!
Well, you know, to be honest sir -- my, my new secretary Ade, came up with that one.
Oh yeah, real cool. You're a cool guy.
(To Susan) I told you it looked like her..
You ask me here to have lunch, tell me you slept with Elaine, and then say you're not in the mood for details. Now you listen to me. I want details and I want them right now. I don't have a job, I have no place to go. You're not in the mood? Well you get in the mood!
Where are you going?
We came in over there!
What did you put the Pez dispenser on her leg for in the first place?
Out of the question.
Hello?
It's baffling, isn't it?
Come on let's get out of here.
This is dating , you can't leave anything to chance.
Yeah! She made me promise not to tell you .It's supposed to be a joke.
Liam Neeson. You know, he's not American.
Jerry ... Where are you? I know you like to sit back here. Elaine! Susan!
Ive had a lot of other paranormal stuff happen to me.
yeah, time is what he's indicating there..
I'll see you guys later.
(standing up, still acting) Uhh! I'm caught in my own web of lies! (holds his hands up in surrender)
I know. It's Mickey Mantle's number. So not only is it an all around beautiful name, it is also a living tribute.
(Holding camera) Look at this, I only have one picture left... How 'bout a shot of me and Mr. Morgan?
My father opened his shirt...
I'm baby-sitting! Vivian asked me to raise him if she doesn't make it.
Slippery Pete. Kramer, hurry up!
Eat me alive, huh? We'll see who can make it in *this* town.
Yeah, fun. IQ tests are totally bogus. They prove nothing.
What is that?
What?
You will?
And... and anybody can do this?
Yes, I saw that.
(crafty) Not necessarily. Why don't you take back the couch you gave me?
Not the feats of strength..
Yeah, come on.
You hurt me.
So what! Have a yoke! It won't kill you.
I have tell you, I'm pretty impressed with the first one.
I'm not! I'm inside the walls!
No, no, this is supposed to go to Joe Mayo's apartment.
Oh, no, no, not at all. No, I have always felt that the most important thing in the world is spending time with family.
This could have been a huge mistake.
Yeah. She's uh, she's something, isn't she?
Well it's not my fault. Seinfeld can't drive. How hard is it to follow somebody?
Are you kidding? People get spaces this good, they never give em up.
Yeah. Got to invite The Drake. Listen hem...there's something that's been on my mind and we haven't really talked about it..I t's kind of important to me.
So I'm sure whatever germs it landed on were knocked out, and by the time the rest of them realised what was going on, you had already grabbed it out.
Dad, he doesn't need to see the pole.
You would think that, but either youre born with a sense of humor, or youre not. Its not going to change even if you go from the red sun of Krypton all the way to the yellow sun of the Earth.
Uh, C-R-E-S-P-I?
Well ...... but how do I get someone else fired?
Because I promised her.
you know, just by conversing, you can really learn a lot about a person.
Yeah, right.
She doesn't deserve a baby shower. She deserves a baby monsoon. She deserves Rosemary's baby!
Jerry! Jerry! Je Jerry Jerry . The most unbelievable thing has just happened, it's too Unbelievable! I'm sitting in the coffee shop, i'm talking to Susan, were talking about shoe laces (does two guns to the head) so in walks..in walks David, right, he walks right to the table..righ I introduced him to Susan..and he says get this (laughs) he says 'boy you could do a lot better than this guy' huh right (more laughing by George, Jerry is totally just mellow and straight faced) The exact same thing that I said to him, just to get back at me just to get back at me..and then, and then she says she wants to be alone for awhile..Alone Jerry! I think that she thinks that she could do better (laughs) Do you appreciate this? Do you see the irony of this? Do you see what is going on here? What's the matter?
I might tell her that I love her. I came this close last night, then I just chickened out.
(to the cashier) Excuse me, I gave you a twenty dollar bill and you only actually gave me change for a ten.
It's not my fault! I wasn't going to do anything until you got her all juiced up with your story about having the affair with the matador!
Elaine said your pretty good at this stuff.
You know, you have to know how to do that. You cant have people shoving their arms into a six-hundred degree oven!
You'll have your turn! The truth must be heard. (Plays back the tape.) That's all there was. And yet, it speaks volumes. A low rumple. A metallic 'squink.' A 'glonk.' Someone crying out..."Dear God!" Let's start with, uh...with you, Wyck.
Really!
Busted cold.
Alright, alright! We'll buy her a wheelchair! Wheelchairs, engagement presents.. IT NEVER ENDS!
Yeah, coy.
You know we're living in a society!
Hey, Elaine.
I just wanted to talk to Tony for a minute (hands Elaine some stuff)
English. Does anybody speak English .Nobody speaks English.
Okay.
You know I'm enjoying it very much. I think my coworkers are really taking to me.
There was a woman, Audrey. She had a very big nose.
Maybe I'll buy it.
You know what I would like to do? I would really like to have sex with a tall woman. I mean really tall. Like a like a giant Like six five.
Oh, no, that's just the old, uh, the old handicap acting up.
No, he isn't.
Well, did you see it?
(incredulity) Him you brainwashed! (angry shout) What's he got that I don't have?!
How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria?
Hnh. That's nerve...
Well, if I could talk to the mothers and have sex with the daughters, then I'd really have something goin'.
You do it for me.
Willie. Yeah.
Oh, the big race.
You can't do that, you can't just sneak in from the back like that.
Because my parents happen to be two pretty wonderful people.
KHAN!
Okay. Hey, you know what, maybe I should give it to my therapist to read. She's smart, I trust her.
Where, where? I can't see.
(getting excited) That's, that's incredible. My Cousin Vinnie, I love her, she was fantastic!
Oh-ho, yeah?
Hm?
85!
Well, it's kind of a mystery, isn't it?
Uh, I'm sorry, I can't do this..
What do you mean, like him?
Is Ted Danson's deal standard?
She says she has to come to New York on business...
Well, I don't see why if you have his, he should have yours.
I am not putting it in a garage, it's my space.
Where's the food? What happened to Ping?
Your clothes smell just like Pisano's. There's another Italian place on Jerome. Maybe I can fool him.
'Cause believe me, I would only say this to you and maybe a psychiatrist, maybe. Well, her nose is a little big.
This is very hard to follow with all the talking.
And this is Kramer.
Now Im in the worst position of all.
Hi honey..
Okay, I guess I'll see you down there.
Hey.
They are?... Elaine?
Aw, Kramer, don't start...
Honesty, hard-work, these are the values that I was raised on. The most important thing Joey, is to be able to look yourself in the mirror before you go to sleep at night.
Would you get out of here. Who's gonna turn down a chair? I would be very interested to know how he felt about all of this. Maybe I'll have a talk with him.
Don't jinx it! Don't jinx (trails off quietly in elation)
Well, uhm, I think I'd like to do it.
(swerving) Hey! Watch it! Did you see that guy? He just gave me the finger!
Hide, hide under the desk.
You dont need a gardener.
No, anything.
Of course it's cashmere.
Yeah, huh.
Check that out (showing newspaper)
All right. So, he caught me in a cleavage peek, so big deal. Who wouldn't look at his daughter's cleavage? She's got nice cleavage.
Oh I'm a chucker.
Elaine? It's me, George. (Elaine opens the door.) Hey, sorry to bother you so late. (To Billy) Hey! How ya doin.' (To Elaine) Uh, did you get any of those sponges?
One... (Glenda seeing George is serious; gets up and leaves)
All right. Let's go over it again, one more time.
Ya-see, how could this not have any fat? It's too good.
Psh. What's the point of even discussing it? [condescendingly takes her hand and pats it] You'll give me the money when you have it. [takes two steps, then reconsiders, then re-reconsiders] I, I trust you.
It's George.
This is the thing where you go and you have to make your own pizza?
I'll get him to see a real doctor. You just stay away from this.
Madam? What are you calling me madam for?
Better than before?
This is totally different! That was my secret, this is Jerry's secret! There's...there's attorney-client priveleges here! If I play it by your rule, no one'll ever confide in me again, I'll be cut out of the loop!
(Talking about his would-be apartment) You could fit 15 people in that bathroom..
I don't know how you can let this guy handle all your money.
(resigned) Dammit.
Its my money. What should I do? Throw it out the window? I know a guy who took his vacation on his change.
So?
I thought we'd all sign the picture.
Ripe. Boy, this Joe's got some terrific fruit.
(to Mickey) Can't you just switch with another Midget?
Well who schedules his wedding on Super Bowl Sunday?
All right. All right. (They both leave)
Here we go.
All right, I made up the part about the car, but the rest is true. And he hated me anyway!
All right, shmoopies...what's it gonna be? Pick a theater.
No, what is it?
See ya later.
Think I'M not?
No!
(cuts into Jerry talking) Chocolate chip mint? Oh well, actually Jerry I prefer chocolate chip. What is it about the chocolate and the mint that makes it go so well together?
I didn't say 'We're Ted Danson.'
$2300.
What's going on?
I got lost on the way over.
That's right.
"Argh!!..Anyway...Jimmy couldn't be here today so he asked me to fill in for him, and I'm sure that you'll be impressed at what can be accomplished after only a few short days of training.....yeah!"
I've tried. We don't have it. But maybe the two of us, working together at full capacity, could do the job of one normal man.
You do.
and JERRY Very nice, very nice, nice.
Not that Im aware of, no.
I'm unbelievable at spelling last names. Give me a last name.
Why am I a marine biologist?
(shamefaced) No.
So, you gonna buy his art?
Hey, I've eaten frogs, so nobody's perfect. Anyway-
Hey.
Give me your key, I gotta get it.
(head down low) I...I wouldn't know"
Yeah. What's that?
Should we be talkin' about this?
You're in latex
No.
Well Elaine was supposed to help me.
Oh, no, nothing.
Maybe she's diabetic.
Exactly!
Hey.
Get out?
Anyway.
They asked you to do career day?
I offered to pay. She should've said no.
(pleased) I know.
(worried) Oh boy.
I dont know. But Simons said that if I wanted to get involved, that Wilkinson would tell me the exact right minute to sell. You wanna do it?
What...are you using my babies now?
uh uh, we're uh ..
Sorry, the players will be reimbursed?
Well, what about the open-lipped kiss?
No, I brought a picture of the chair.
No. I--I paid for it.
(regarding the menu) What're you getting?
Whose are these?
I know. This was the only woman I never lied to. Well thats not entirely true.
So? Movie tonight?
GUILTY!
I want evens.
So the plan is to secretly sterilise her mouth?
George, how you doing?
Oh, look, he's going to ask you about my arm. So, just tell him I banged it against a desk. And it's been moving involuntarily ever since.
I needed it! My back is... a little tweaked.
A signal, right, um, okay, uh, okay, the signal is, Ill call out tippy-toe!
To be polite. I rest my case.
Come on. Ya wanna go get some lunch?
Almost there.
..So, one thing lead to another..
I don't want to talk about it.
I said preferably cashmere, for warmth. So in front of the whole party, he says, 'No. I don't want you stretching out the neck hole.'
I walked in, your lobby door is broken again.
Who doesn't like cashmere? Find me one person in the world that doesn't like cashmere. It's too expensive.
Why? What do you mean?
What did we say? Two seventy-five?
All right I gotta get going.
You're not going to get back here in time!
I had a little tiff with Bonnie about the roommate.
The *bank*? This is *found* money. I want to *parlay* it. I wanna make a big score!
Why shave every day? It just grows right back.
(thinking) This guy's perfect.
Yeah, and you were engaged for like a minute, I was engaged for a year.
(Starting to panic again) What? Oh my God. What? Is it meningitis? Scoliosis? Lupis?! Is it Lupis?!
You wanna see?! (pulling off the hat to reveal the bald pate) There! There it is! (turning to Newman) Alright, here! You wanna try on the hat?! Here! Try on the hat!
You see (to Jerry). You see. You see what Im talking about. It's all just slipping away. And you're letting it happen. (exits -- slamming the door)
(Quick, excited talking) Hey, hey! You can't believe this. Look at this check! (Hands it to Jerry) They told me I had the most beautiful hands they'd ever seen in their lives - except for this McKigney guy - this great looking girl gave me her phone number.. I got it! I got it all! I'm busting. Jerry, I'm busting!
Yes you did!
(meekly) Well, it's true. I saw it.
Is-is that what I said 'no story'? Because Jerry had to tell me later.
The... drivel... parts. Oh my gosh, I just realized  I have to make a phone call. I-I cant believe- Would you-
What are you repeating everything I'm saying?
Oh, I think so, and I can prove it. You see, I was doodling on the bill and uh, so if you have a twenty in there with big lips on it... well, (smiles) that's mine. Would you mind opening up the register?
What is that? B.O.?
"Hey listen, let me give you my card. It's got my home number on it. I want to buy the first pair when the next shipment comes in."
Next to each other?
Fine.
Jerry, can we get out of here?!
Lot of good ones. I don't even want to mention anyone because I'm afraid I'm going to leave somebody out.
I went to look in the mirror, it wasn't there. You threw off my equilibrium.
You did?
Or maybe, she just wanted to go to the Tony's. I tell you what; you ask her out again. No Tony, just Jerry. That way you know it he was her dude or just some dude.
No, why, what's happening?
So, what's wrong with him?
That's true.
. We should be having dinner with our sons when we're sixty.
Been there, done that.
He scratches off a 32 and he puts in 31.
Take a wild guess.
He..He threatened me.
(Guessing the look) Stink eye?
Yeah, yeah. That's how they talk in the major league. (laughs)
Well, if it's as good as ``Ponce de Leon'', I'll be happy.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Chunnel . Susan!
Yeah so did I.
Anything, everything, something, nothing - Who the hell cares? Put me down. I'm down!
Hehehe. .(feebly)
The guy playing Kramer threatened me.
You know, if it was a regular salad I wouldn't have said anything. But you had to have the BIG SALAD.
Buzz cuts? Parachute pants!
(Reading) I see here that you play the harp.. tell me, why do you have to tilt it? Can't you just build it on an angle? It'd save you a lot of trouble.
(Yelling out to a waitress) Gonna need some water here!
Smile.
No, no. I'm not going on.
(anger) Well now it's not gonna be original! It's gonna lose all its cachet!
(surprised) You know her name?
All right. (throws his coat back down on the seat and sits down opposite them)
Top priority.
I'll call a plumber right now! (Goes for the phone.)
Why is nice bad? What kind a of sick society we are living in, when nice is bad?
Oh, you hesitated.
He did that?
For you.
Why not?
Did you ever meet my friend, Simons?
I mean , when I said Hello did she say Hello back?
Yeah. I had a great time.
Out. (Jerry shakes his head in agreement) Wow. I spend so much time trying to get their clothes off, I never thought of taking mine off. (Jerry nods; George looks at his watch) Alright, Hey come on, get out of here, Dophne gonna be here any minute.
Let me just see it.
well I don't know if there's gonna be any place to eat up there
Boy, that was awkward!
I couldn't take it anymore.
Of course you do, but youre imagining a guy you like, not a guy who goes, Oh no, I dont drink coffee late at night. If I call her now, shes gonna think Im too needy. Women dont wanna see need. They want a take-charge guy  a colonel, a Kaiser, a tsar.
Didja see the way she was looking at me?
Great! Great! I actually just had two meaningful intelligent conversations with Corbin Bernsen and George Wendt.
Maybe I could move them until you get back.
Hi.
Really? What happened?
An apartment-warming gift? We got to give presents to people for moving? Birthdays, Christmas, it's enough gifts. I would like one month off.
I know, but don't say anything to anyone. He told me not to tell you.
I'm gay! I'm a gay man! I'm very, very gay.
(???), we'll see you in a little while.
Now I remember, as I jumped over the hole I heard a, like a jingling sound.
No, I saw "Home Alone II".
My credit card?
The Rogue's Wallet. That's where he kept his card, his dirty little secret. Short, devious, balding. his name was Costanza. He killed my mother.
I'll drive.
(getting annoyed) Hang on, it's warming up!
(interested) Really?
By the way, you owe me seven fifty.
Just inch over. You worm your way.
All I know is I've been going to doctors all my life. What has it gotten me? I'm thirty-three years old. I haven't outgrown the problems of puberty, I'm already facing the problems of old age. I completely skipped healthy adulthood. I went from having orgasms immediately to taking forever. You could do your taxes in the time it takes me to have an orgasm. I've never had a normal, medium orgasm.
Yeah.
(Laughs) Steven, nothing is higher than an architect.
Shes a pig. The woman's a pig, what wrong with her--
I don't know. I do know that I have some kind of a talent - something to offer. I just don't know what it is yet!
The attic? Y-you haven't wore any of those clothes for years.
Because I know him too, and probably a lot better than you.
(hangs up the phone) That's my toaster. I got to go. Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh!
(Sliding over to make room for her) Sit down. Join us, please.
(to Carrie) You know, you're really being very selfish. It would be nice if you would think of someone other than yourself every now and then!
I love this place. You know, Carl and I come here all the time.
I show up. I pretend I have the job. The guy's on vacation. If I have the job, it's fine. If I don't have the job, by the time he comes back, I'm ensconced.
And now?
He's ripping you off
What were you doing?
(Desperate to get rid of the book) Alright, I, I'll just take fifty. Do - do we have a deal?
I'm out! Fantastic apartment right across from mine, huh. I can't wait for you to see it.
This is delicious, Mrs. Ross.
Well then, from out of nowhere, a huge tidal wave lifted me, tossed like a cork and I found myself right on top of him, (ELAINE gasps quietly Ahhhh) face to face with the blow-hole. I-I, I could barely see from the waves crashing down upon me but, I knew something was there so I reached my hand in, felt around and pulled out the obstruction!
Yeah. What are you doing with the Daily Worker?
Too good...
Alright, that's enough.
I know, I know, thats what they said.
(high-fiving) Hey!
What's with the gloves?
W-ca-What did they do?
A dry-cleaning bill?
So you're buying the car back for your parents?
What if the pilot gets picked up and it becomes a series?
Toasting makes me uncomfortable. But toast, I love. Never start the day without a good piece of toast. In fact, let's toast to toast.
(pleading) Elaine, c'mon. Would you just make the call? (indicates the phone) Please, make the call.
No, no! You can't throw me out
At the funeral, give or take. You know, deep down, I always kinda felt that they blamed me for Susan's death.
I have an aunt that died at seven.
The movies. Blimp is playing right there.
What?
No, no, Kurt - wrong attitude. You should be happy now.
You see those tears streaming down you don't know what to do. It was like she was on fire and I was trying to put her out.
No, I know I don't have to, I want to.
You uh owe me for the ticket.
Oh, real good. (George makes a face like you stink) Any word from NBC?
What?
you said "step off"? wow, that is too much hey..huh hey (George turns the cap his wearing backwards like Tony) Tony, I huh, I just had this brainstorm for us. Can you guess what it is?
Hello.
Jon Voight?
(noticing something) Hey look, a dime.
Don't go shouting we got a hundred dollar bill. People will be jumping out of windows on top of us.
You idiots. You're gonna wear down the battery.
(shaking hands) I'm George.
Why doesn't *he* pick you up after the operation. He's got the car with the bench seats that you like.
Why should I care?
Alrighty, so. That's one tuck and one no-tuck. Got that?
You think so?
Kissing is sex.
You had dinner with the Seinfelds'?
These fries are really really good...
Why? What's wrong with the subject? This is a bad subject?
*No*...
See ya.
Yeah.
Yeah, sure, we met at Jerry Seinfeld's apartment. When you fumigated for fleas over there.
God, I'm starved, I'm weak from hunger.
Anyway, I think everything else is okay. Unless of course she's faking.
Alright, fine.I'll drive the 3 hours each way, 6 hours all together, and take 'em off myself!!
Allison! Hi! Oh, my God! How are you?
I don't know....hmmm ha! here's the doctor.
FINE? WHAT SIZE?
Hello? Amanda. Hi, yes. Listen. You know, I'm thinkin', we might just be better of bein' friends. Yeah. Yeah, you know what, I can't even really talk about it right now. Bye-bye. (hangs up) (happy with himself, but then sees the burned up photo) No! No!
I don't have a hi-fi.
(adamant) Ah, c'mon! I'm telling you, I can coach for the NFL. It's not that hard
(shrugs and lights it up)
What did Jodi say?
Alright, maybe I do. So what.
(animated) Some guy. Some guy? Neil! I have got to find out how he could get a girl like Danielle.
(Sincerely) Thank you.. I, uh.. that might not work out.
Yoohoo ,Plenty......Wh..wh..what are doing hum...you're going in?
Look, why couldn't you make me an architect? You know I always wanted to pretend that I was an architect. Well I-I'm supposed to see her tomorrow, I-I-I'm gonna tell her what's goin on. I mean maybe she just likes me for me.
Right. The other members of our party. (closes partition) Other members of our party? What other members of our party? I didn't even know we were in a party. Oh, I'm telling you, the jig is up.
(sitting down) Where's Hanke?
When I find that guy, this much I vow those glasses will be returned to their rightful owner.
Are.. are you okay?
Going to need a little more coffee here.
A little breakfast.
Well take a look. It might not even belong to her.
He's on vacation.
Oh, I find you so charming. You wuss.
Bye Mrs Seinfeld, take care.
What? Must be a big one.
(trying again with Glenda) I'm gonna count to three. If you don't give up the chair, the wig is coming off.
(tearing out cheque) Yeah, same time. (hands over cheque) There you go.
You fixed me up with a bald woman.
Yeah, I think, you know, she was, like, crying, and he was consoling her, and then, she, uh, just got into his car, and they just drove away.
(excited) Did I tell you that story's relatable?! That was a great show! That is why I'm bringing it back to NBC.
Why is that?
Boy, my knuckles are still cramped from that football game.
Yes, they are bold. Jerry, what do you think?
You think you could hook me up with these guys?
What?
(entering) Last night, huh? Was that something, or was that something?
That's a tough minute. It's like waiting in the shower for the conditioner to work.
Really? What does it mean?
Yeah, yeah. Shes punctual... and uh shes been late, sometimes.
Would you stop that? It's not safe to be jumping up and down on a plane.
The perfect combination of Mountain Dew and mozzarella...just the right amount of grease on the joy stick...
I am. Im a nice guy. And she seduced me! We were in my apartment, Im sitting on the couch, shes on the chair. I get up to go to the bathroom, I come back, shes on the couch. What am I supposed to do? Not do anything? I couldnt do that. I wouldve insulted her.
Well I can't now, Gwen's going to be there.
You said the guy gave you an open-lipped kiss!
What am I going to do now? I can't live without Susan. I gotta get her back. How? How, am I gonna get her back?
What are we gonna tell Jerry about the car?
Did you say, "The rines are crossed?"
Mr. Pensky? Of the Pensky file?
"All right, I'll see you guys later."
(backing off) Huh? All right, fine.
(to Kramer) It's a funeral procession. . . . (to Elaine) And I got news for you. I show up with Ring Dings and Pepsi, I become the biggest hit of the party. People be coming up to me, "just between you and me I'm really excited about the Ring Dings and the Pepsi. What are we, Europeans with the Beaujolais and Chardonnay . . .
Oh, no no no, I'm fine. Let me help you with these dishes, huh?
No, he said there was nothing he could do, and next time I should probably break the Prozacs in half.
Sure. (Turns around.)
Why can't we do this on the phone? What's Kramer doing now?
My regular face.
This friend of Susan's is staying with us for two weeks...Now am I wrong or is that excessive?
(we hear him think) My friends are idiots, she doesn't look like Jerry. She doesn't look like anybody. And so what if does look like Jerry,what does that mean?. That I could have everything I have with Jerry but because it's a woman I could also have sex with her....And that somehow that would be exactly what I always wanted.....She doesn't even look like Jerry..
Hi.
Hey.
Gone. (Moves over to a chair in the living room. Kramer takes the carton of food to the table, and begins eating) The tenant association made me give it to this guy because he was an Andrea Doria survivor..
When do you ever have ten car lengths?
Tell you about the Portuguese waitress.
I got it.
Look at this. There's no spaces here. (to another car) Excuse me, are you gettin' out?
You never played Vegas.
We're slowing down. Are those the people?
Ooh ho hoo, forget it.
Why don't you just ask him?
Do you really think I'm wrong about this Wyck guy?
Extraordinarily gay. Steeped in gayness.
You're not a doctor. You shouldn't even have books like this.
Oh of course you can use it, sure. (Jerry saying stuff through the phone) Ok, bye. (hangs the phone up)
Your friend is been accused of being a serial killer. I think that qualifies.
I've just met her but I'm very impressed.
No. And he's not a pig-man is he?
Holly.
(sarcasm) Hu-hu, like I don't know that? (excitement) My Cousin Vinnie, I love that! I, George Costanza, could be on a date with an Oscar winner! An Oscar winner, Jerry! You know what that's like? It's like if fifty years ago, someone fixed me up with Katherine Hepburn? Same thing!
Oh...uh, because if it had anything at all to do with what you perceived as me leering at your daughter, I really have to take issue with that. I did not leer. (To Jerry) Did I leer?
Did she show her breasts in that?
(after a moment's thought) Art Vandelay.
Thank you.
I don't know her.
No, no, no. Nothing happens.
My in-laws. Oh, my....
I told them to meet me in front of my building at six-fifteen.
Wait. Whoa! That's the Rabbi from Elaine's building. I just met this guy the other day.
You know what I do at the Yankees, when one of these old guys is breathing down my neck?
Daphne. I have to tell you something, this is very difficult...
Well, anything I can do to help, um...she's a wonderful girl. Very smart. Very eh...crafty.
Huh (quietly)
Yeah, yeah, but he doesn't wear glasses.
Well good, good. Take it off you're going to wear it out already. It's for special occasions this thing.
Like what? What could they say?
Oh, Rita. Hey, Mr. Shermack, how're you doing, good to see you. Jay, always a pleasure. (To Susan) Sweetie. (Kisses her and then sits down next to Jerry) Yeah, yeah, that butler idea, that's beautiful. Isn't that killer? (Aside to Jerry) I thought I was getting the butler.
That I'm used to. (he leaves)
Na, he's gone. I wonder what happened to him.
I'm goin' in!
We have to discuss my alibi.
Yeah.
Elaine.
You, uh, didn't dance again, did you?
Gary? Well, well, well well. Where the hell've you been? I've been leaving you phone messages for months.
I dont know. I cant believe theyre making me take this test.
I, I think I made my point. I'm sorry if I was a little harsh.
" I'll always be a winner and you'll always be a loser." This is what he said to me.
Elaine, can I just explain something to you very privately here? Susan and I have been together many, many times now, and just between you and me, there's really no big surprises here, so...make-up sex is all that I have left.
(Studying the salt shaker) I'm not taking a civil service test.
This uniform, what's it made from?
You can see the Cayman Islands in there? Is something going to happen to me? What?
Uh-Huh (gulp) Why didn't she like me?
I thought I saw something fly over here...
Well, yeah.
Well, people never give a good 'hello' at a funeral. I mean, they go like this (George gives an extremely understated nod) That's the biggest.
YES! It Blows Up! If you knew that, what did you tell Elaine for?
Why? Did she say something to you about why she broke up with me?
Oh, Im Im full of it Father.
Everybody's doing something, we'll do nothing.
I, I couldn't help but notice that uh you don't have a chair.
What are ya doing?! Whadya, crazy?!
KEITH HERNANDEZ?
oh Tony don't
Ya manufacture it.
Well, whoever he was, he knew a lot about The A-Team!
No. Autonomy, complete and total autonomy.
Yes! Yes, I'm the one! Hey! So, you know Jon Voight!
Who's going to bomb you. An airline for all the stupid little peanut jokes.
Oh, ... some stupid movie...
Good afternoon. One large crab bisque to go. Bread. Beautiful.
You didn't tell her.
What?
What happened to Putty?
Yeah.
Yuh. What about physically?
You miss her.
Yeah. Let's go.
I'm the bad boy. I've never been the bad boy.
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, thank you.
Twelve dollars? I knew we should have gone to the bakery. I guarantee you theyre not getting no twelve dollar cake.
I don't think so I know so, Kramer, come here I got to talk to you
Ok, so, what'dya got?
Um, excuse me, I think you forgot my bread.
Maybe she could like me? Is it that far fetched? Maybe she sees something? Is it possible?
I didn't think you wore them anymore.
Yes a cruise, a long cruise, just the two of you.
I thought he looked Irish.
Kramer, trust me, this is the best bathroom in midtown!
That's unbelievable!
Yes! And I put him up to it, because I'm sick! I'm the one that needs help.
So let's say in her mind she witnessed a pick. Okay, so then what?
Above the rim.
(hesitant) Uh, Mr Wilhelm. Uh, about the project...
Alright, so, we need something..
Oh, nothin' much. I went over to jerry's, uh, talked to Jerry.
(TO JERRY, SOMEWHAT IMPRESSED) A Red Chinese prison?
Well, I think this is it.
Elaine.
Uh, nothing, lets get going. Come on. (laughs) hu hu.
There's nothing I can even impart to you, that's the sad thing. It's so inborn, I can't pass it on. (begins backing into the space) Look at this guy. Are you crazy, what are you doing?! Hey! Hey, you're stealing my space!
What did you do here? You took out the wrong guy.
I need like a bucket of water! I got a car overheating, I got an alarm that won't go off, I'm pressing 'one', I'm pressing 'two', nothing! What do I do?! Help me! Help me!
Oh no no no, they don't want to join us.
Yeah, Jimmy why don't you wait outside, you know, play with something.
(pointing at Jerry) Oh, hes the comedian.
(Nodding, writing) "How's it going?"
Yeah, I would. It's just, you know, I just ate a whole pot roast.
Yes I did.
Coming to the airport with us?
Hey. Where is everyone?
But Jerry, this is not coming out!
What's so funny?
Your own show?
Uh huh. Uh huh! I think you spoke to your little friend Rachel, that's what I think.
Uh, good. You know, you might wanna try eating it with one of these. (Holds up lobster bib)
Youre a fine person. Youre a humanitarian. Shes very sexy.
I don't know.
You think this is the plane that Ted Danson gets?
She um, she wants to see The Muted Heart.
Well a lot of people consider me small and prestigious.
Oh! Modelling! What's that like? Fun? Ha ha. (to self in head) Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!
Jon Voight! Are you kiddin' me? Did you talk to him?
Cosmo
Jerry, I'm trapped under my desk. Steinbrenner is in the room. You got to help[ me.
You got isobutane-30?
No. He was fine with it. Check that out.
What's she like? Impressive?
Interesting.
Really?
I'm just happy to be working with your talented son...
Hey could you do one other thing for me?
An apartment complex, the uh the Eiffel Towers. uumm Like I said uh you'll be getting a postcard uh in a few days and again I'm sorry.
Yes, she hates cigarettes.
(to himself) That's what I'd like to know.
(frustrated) Ahh!
This was supposed to be 'The summer of George'! The summer of George.
What?
There you go.
(While skimming a Monk's menu) You know, I didn't go to the bathroom the entire time we were in India.
(with a mouth full of food) This is good. Oh, this is good.
ah.
Well played.
She tolerated the strawberries and the chocolate sauce, but eh, it's not a meal, you know? Food and sex, those are my two passions. It's only natural to combine them.
(To Elaine) Hey, what happened?
Coffees coffee in the morning. Its not coffee at twelve oclock at night.
Yeah.
But it's not a photograph, I need a photograph!
My cousin worked for Bouchard's. They used to use the bouilla-base for a toilet. (Jerry and Russell are shocked.)
The third?
(Trying to keep it down) Because I like this one! (Notices people staring at him, he quickly gets up, collecting the his coat and the tiny replica) C'mon, let's go. Let's go! (On his way out, he stops in front of a woman blocking his path) Oh, hi.. (Embarrassed about the doll, he sheepishly walks out)
yeah
Where's the remote phone?
I don't know if you're ready for it.
It's a broad noodle.
Hi, I need some party invitations.
You know I uh, spilled a yogurt smoothie in here two days ago. Hm, Can't smell anything, can ya?
Rest stop supply.
Yeah, Like I don't know that I'm pathetic.
Well it's over. It's definitely over.
Yeah. One second sweetheart. Jerry, I really think it'd be easier if you didn't tuck.
??? KNOCK OFFS. I NOT GOING TO DO IT! AND YOU'RE GOING TO CALL STEINBRENNER BACK AND CANCEL THE WHOLE THING.
Well, just tell Kramer to tell her.
A lot of people say it.
Ah. You know, there's gotta be an easier way to open ketchups. They should make it in a tube.
(Pleading) Please, please, they're gonna hit me! (Attempts to grab Helen's purse, she starts hitting George defensively, he backs off)
(Still holding the note) I think I'm having a heart attack.
A preemptive breakup. This is an incredible idea. I got nothing to lose. We either break up which she would do anyway but at least I go out with some Dignity. Completely turn the tables. It's absolutely brilliant.
she's there, I can hear her
Yeah, they eh, they do a lot of baking up there.
(pause) Are you?
Pick it up, pick it up!
I mean, how funny is this?
She didn't mention anything about the conversation?
Robin? Robin!
...I broke up with her.
Good. Of course...
It happens.
Hey, hey.
I do for the bad things.
Its not easy.
Look...
Yeah.
Wha.. you ran?
All right. So let me ask you a question. Who was the man in the cape?
Yesssss.
Nevertheless.. I was wondering if you and your .friends are doing business here at the Jiffy Park.... You know ..hum What do you people call it? Turning tricks? Anyway I...I....found a condom in my car....and I'm not saying it's yours but.... I want to know if I should just change parking lots.
Keep your head down.
Its bad?
Really?
Mario's Pizza.
Hotel.
Hey, people, people, people, people, people. Not bad, huh? Excuse me.
(Annoyed) Frog is wrong.
(eating a pickle) Well they're his tickets, he can do what he wants with them.
What, have you completely lost your mind?
He chose the cats?
[pause] Tonight?
What $98.00?
It would have been nice if someone told me about it. I just think you could have said something. That's all.
Well, go ahead! Do it!
Yeah, conjugal visit sex. That is happening!
I love you, Jerry.
Well, I heard a noise.
No.
What did you go on a picnic?
Let me ask you something. What do you do for a living, Newman?
I know Jerry. He has this phobia about public toilets. I think we really should go upstairs.
Wait, wait wait, not so fast. Jerry, you gotta take me to get this thing refinished.
Pull hair, Poke eyes, Groin stuff. Whatever I gotta do. (he opens a blue bottled beverage)
Oh! you taped it?
(grabs the phone quick) Got it, Got it,...Hello?
(mildly embarrassed) yeah.. Thank you.
Hello.
That's the genius of it.
Yes.
Mmm-mm.
Well, how did she react?
Because, Jerry, it's a couple rule! We have to tell each other everything!
Excuse me, are you gonna be very long?
Sometimes in life, the gods smile upon you, my friends.
Of course he should consider it, but now is not the time!
This is incredible!
Two fifty? Are you sure
Are we really doing this?
Uh, yeah, I'll be there in a minute.
What?! Well, what are you doing here?
MOOPS
Haaaaaa!!!
Me too, really. Unless you'd really like to get one.
Y'know if the guy dies, the art could really be worth something...
Pop? What happened to Pop?
Excuse me. Am I talking to you, Pinhead? Am I?!
(sidling in) Is this a bad time? I hope I'm not disturbing anything.
I don't know. They're all very suspicious.
Hey Elaine. (George hangs up his raincoat next to the door) Im telling you Jerry, having a secretary is incredible. (George claps hands) I don't know why I didnt have one before.
They always make me take stock of my life. And how Ive pretty much wasted all of it, and how I plan to continue wasting it.
He probably doesn't want to get chocolate on his fingers. That's the way these society types eat their candy bars.
I've had bedroom naked, I've had walk-to-the-bathroom naked... I have never had living-room naked.
What are you doing?!
It was you!
(enters) Hi.
Probably because this whole Universe is against me!
What is a barometer exactly?
No, it's a Newman. Well, I gotta run. (Smiles, pats his briefcase and exits.)
Medium turkey chili.
Oh Shut up! What are you doing back so soon, anyway? (puts the tape back in it's case.)
So, uh, Mom, Dad, I was hoping that you could help me to remember my childhood a little clearly..
Don't need it. N'huhuhu (laughs)
She's right, I heard Kramer got mugged out on the suburbs on a baby-sitting gig.
Next Friday, what time?
(annoyed) Not a peep. They just cleaned the carpets and left. Call themselves a cult!
All right! All right. I'll tell you what. How about this? Got the date; March 21st, the first day of spring.
No, no. No, no, no. It was not trash!
You know. (All three give him blank stares) I was alone..
Alright, let's go.
(Laughs nervously) ..Ulterior motive.
(shouting) No No No!
Go, go, go, don't worry about it.
Dollar Eighty-Nine. Why is this a dollar eighty-nine? Why is there no haggling in this country?
Will you stop it?
Yes!
Since when is Elaine's boyfriend selling cars? I thought he was a mechanic.
People can drop change down here, Jerry. And theyre too lazy to pick it up.
There putting in a lost and found because of me. There's a time limit but still.
Hey.
What, I'm puttin' my shirt back on.
Yeah. Yeah, he's quite a character.
Yeah, he once bumped into reverend Yung Sun Moon.
And I have to go. If I don't go, he'll know I'm lying.
She doesn't want to get a bra.
Definitely.
(Slowly shakes his head) My mother caught me.
That's it. That's the line... (squirts mustard into Jerry's coffee and stirs it) ...that destroyed my life.
No.
A... ah...
C'mon Jerry, let's go. What was that all about?
My presence, in that office, can only hurt my chances.
Man, I'm starving.
Five thousand... Ten. Ten thousand. Five thousand.
I really think it looks good.
Uh, railroads, uh...
This is a crude mock-up of the conference room. 1/14th scale.
Sweetheart, I was exaggerating.
Okay, all right, all right.
Ow! Hot! Hot!
No, no she wasn't.
What about a letter?
Handicap? (gesturing to his cane) Oh, I'm not handicapped.
Oh, I dont get the enthusiastic hi, Im outta there.
Joe...could you...
So, attractive one day - not attractive the next?
We should take his limo.
Wait a second, where are you going?
Could anybody do that?
Oh, he stole it!
Hey (sees the coffee stain) Art Garfunkel?
And it's their anniversary Friday night. I could send them for a hansom cab ride. Y -- you think they'd like that?
Same thing. My god, I'm getting married in December, do you know that?
(enthusiastic) Yeah. You get a couch. I get rid of my father. It couldn't be more perfect!
What, are you doing me a favor?
You're going like that?
Hey, hey! Yankee game! (Changes the channel.)
??? sir.
Uh, it's only a matter of time.
Hey, at least I was a camp waiter.
This isn't going well.
Or we could get them together. Woo!
(MUMBLING) You come to a parking lot, you write it down. How hard is that?
(smug) Ah, I guess I showed Neil who's Neil.
It's me.
That's not Irish.
I used to share that same outlook. But now, I have so many things to occupy my mind. For instance, the atom.
A ha! We're just friends.
(Looking over the writing materials they just bought) Bics? What, d'ja get, bics?
It's like the manager coming out and asking you for the ball.
Oh, yeah, sure. Keep your money.
Why not? Pay is good. I got dental, private access to one of the great handicapped toilets in the city.
Thats it! Thats it! I cant take it. I cant take it anymore! You stole the statue! Youre a theif! Youre a liar!
He left perfect imprints.
(Interrupts) And I still say hes naked under there!
Well anyway, the, uh... the stone is up, I paid my respects, guess that's it.
(Struggling) No, no, no, no. I can walk it off. It's a hundred and twenty degrees in here.. I'll sweat it out.
Sure.
Dwayne, my friend and I would like to exchange frames. Could you put his lenses in my frames and mine in his?
Hey, there's a tomato stand, let's stop, I can get some more.
What if he left you a used Kleenex, what's that, a valentine? Now you go up to him and you tell him that if he's thinking of turning me in, that I got the goods on him!
Its called Sendrax. Theyve got some new kind of technique for televising opera.
Wha - what happened? What are you doing back so soon?
Me Too! And he's Dying Jerry! If Relationship George walks through this door, he will Kill Independent George! A George, divided against itself, Cannot Stand!
I think something's happening here.
Then of course with evolution, the octopus lost the nostrils and took on the more familiar look that we know today.
Oh, yeah. Downtown. Definitely.
No one's putting a gun to your head. Do I, uh, scare you?
Sure, all right, what do you want?
I believe that I am about to become the target of a systematic process of intimidation and manipulation, the likes of which you have never -
Chunnel ?
I usually spend Saturday afternoons with Susan. She's gonna want to know what I'm doing. I can't use Jerry, he's in Florida.
Very nice Tom, that was terrific.
The network executive. You think she liked me?
Say you, me, and Kramer are, uh, flying over the Andes.
So now, the father is screaming at me, he's demanding that I pay for the boom box. Finally, I gave them a fake address and got the hell out of there.
Holes! I need holes!
You go in and save seats.
No, I dont care.
I'm sorry - I have to say, I'm a little disappointed, I thought it would be a lot nicer.
40? I'm payin' 60 to my maid. She doesn't do laundry and I'm gettin' nothin'. All right. Once she pinched my ass, but I don't know what that was.
I don't care. Look, Lloyd doesn't know what he's up against. This is nothing to me. (moving his arm) My whole life is a lie.
Well... it's a magnificent stone.
It's mellifluous!
(Putting his hands up) Alright, alright, hold on! (Jerry has George's full attention) Time out! Woah, woah! (Scooting in, giddy) What did she say?
Oh yeah! Middle finger, straight up, at me! At us!
Well say were frightened and we have to go home.
I thought he was just gonna have a muffin.
Well, it always has to be explained to me, and then I have to have someone explain the explanation.
They could kick me out of the health club if he tells them!
I, uh...figure it's something. (Kramer enters.)
Kramer was on Murphy Brown?
What do you think? The brought it over in pieces and screwed it together like a coffee table?
Well, here we are.
What does that mean?
You know, I used to love Paris. My uh, dead Fiance, Susan.. (opening wallet) In fact I. think I, I may have a picture of her..
Well, wait a little while, Ma. What's the difference?
I don't know. I closed my eyes and made a move.
I need everything in there.
No no.
This is for you.
Yeah.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. You can't say anything. (rushes to take phone from Jerry)
Oh, this isn't even B.O.! This is *beyond* B.O.! It's *B*.B.O.!
They're worse! They're much worse than us, they talk about everything! Couldn't you at least tell her about the shrinkage factor?
It's possible.
Well, you know, I gotta go to, uh, Susan's parent's house for dinner.. and, you know, I want to shower first.. and I want to leave myself plenty of time.
Yeah.
'When you're alone, and life is making you lonely, you can always go...'
Story.
So, whaddya say? You know you'll always be the only man I'll ever love.
(Sheepishly to Elaine) I'll be right back. (Leaves)
Oh, no no no -- We bought the wine here before, but now, you know we're bl-blocked in by some car double parked and we're just waiting for the guy to pull out.
I can never get the package open in time.
Right.
I bought a new recliner with a fridge build right in to it.
Susan B. Anthony** I think I'd have a problem with.
It's like a magic trick. Sometimes I think it would be easier to bend a spoon mentally than to make that transformation.
I believe strongly in that as you know.
It's cleavage. I couldn't look away. What am I, waiting to win an Oscar here? This is all I have in my life.
I'm not going back in there.
People always leave old things in their medicine cabinet.
Nooooo.
All right, relax, tough guy. I got to go out to my father's garage, help him sell some computers.
Did you ever go to a singles weekend in the Poconos?
(big smile) Eight thousand dollars.
Mrs. Seinfeld?!?
Woo! Courtside! (mock-snide) Is that the best you could do? Ha ha!
oh, . . .because she handed you the bag. I could have handed you the bag. She happened to pick it up at the restaurant even though, . . .
Hey, she wants me to dress uh "smart casual." What uh, what is that?
Wait a second. 'Little places to go, where they never close.' What's a little place that never closes?
The closet business? What's the closet business?
Karen.
Hey, it's George. Listen, I-
(Extremely blunt) Burned.
Why don't you give me the twenty, and I'll stop and get change, and then you and I can... uh... you-know, settle.
Go, go, get out, ...
What did you do?
What'd he tell you?
Wha! You know, it's a pain to change that. You gotta lift up that plastic thing with a pen.
Yeah.
That's a great idea!!!
You know how easy it is for dead people to travel? Its not like getting on a bus. One second. (snaps his fingers) Its all mental.
When did you leave the message?
(insincerely) Ahh, hey you're home. Hi.
Yeah, yeah, she's here.
Please.
Really?
Yeah, yeah. Well, I guess I started losing it when I was about twenty-eight right around the time I made my first million. You know what they say. The first million is the hardest one.
Wow. Excuse me, Miss?
Know him? Would you, uh, like to meet him?
Oh.
But why?
All my friends do that.
I have to talk to you about something .
I gotta go back to the library and talk to him. I gotta find out if I&Mac226;m the guy who ruined his life.
Maybe I'll get her some jewelry.
Now, if this mechanic guy, was, in fact, eating a 5th Avenue bar, as he claims, wouldnt you agree he would have no problem picking one out from a candy line-up?
You're sorry?!
She must have seen me eating it on TV.
Did I get him in trouble? Because of what I said?! I just told him what happened.. he didn't do it on purpose.. (Mangager and busboy are arguing. The busboy points in the direction of George) He pointed at me. Why did he point at me?!
Payroll!!
Hey.
What'dya got?
I suppose he could swivel. Hey maybe one of those director's chairs. What do you think of those.
You know, Louise. I think you'll find this amusing. In early Euclidean geometry--
...so mind you, at this point I'm only going out with her two or three weeks. So she goes out of town and she asks me to feed her cat. So at this time, there's a lot of stuff going on in my life and, uh, it slips my mind for a few days. Maybe a week. Not a week, five, six days.
I'll tell you something, I've never seen a pilot script as funny as this!
I know!
Aah! Fire!
(Shrugging it off) She'll be fine. I gotta go to the hospital to see her tonight.
Ask' em Are there any side effects?
Ya, sure sure.
So what, what is so bad about that?
Super Savers? Are they refundable!?
Yeah!, a doodle of me...look at the size of the nose , the ears, all my features are distorted.
(upset) Well, you've scared her off. We may never see mom again.
What a succinct story.
Because the underwear is pulled up from the back and ... it wedges in..
About six years ago.
I'm gonna do it.
(pulls a face) I find it disorienting. Who buys an umbrella anyway? Y..you get 'em for free in the coffee shop in the metal cans.
I love the mirror in that bathroom! I dont know what in the hell it is. I look terrific in that mirror. (George sits.) I dont know if its the tile or the lighting... I feel like Robert Wagner.
Well, you should always consider podiatry. (Patting Ricky on the shoulder) There's nothing wrong with the feet. (Ricky looks critically back at George)
And Ill tell you something else, Im not even going to ask you. I want to know. But Im not gonna ask. Youll tell me when you feel comfortable. So what was it? Four hundred? Five hundred? Did you pay five hundred for this? (Jerry coyly ignores Georges questions, while George grows increasingly serious.) Over six? Cant be seven. Dont tell me you paid seven hundred dollars for this jacket! Did you pay seven hundred dollars for this jacket? Is that what youre saying to me? You are sick! Is that what you paid for this jacket? Over seven hundred? What did you pay for this jacket?! I wont say anything. I wanna know what you paid for this jacket! Oh my God! A thousand dollars?! You paid a thousand dollars for this jacket?! All right, fine. (George heads for the door.) Im walking outta here right now thinking you paid a thousand dollars for this jacket, unless you tell me different. (Jerry remains silent.) Oh, ho! All right! Ill tell you what, if you dont say anything in the next five seconds, Ill know it was over a thousand.
Allright, very good I'd like my car and my deposit back please
What happened to your voice?
What did I get the veggie burger for? You got a veggie burger, so I had to get the veggie burger, I'm allover crums...
Excuse me, sir, do you have the time?
I went to the beach. (Jerry and Elaine exchange looks)
All right... here goes...
Really, I was, I was only kidding around.
Can't we discuss this?
(whistling).(laughing).AlrightOK.
Hey, let's turn off the lights, get some real 'movie atmosphere.'
Really? Who?
He didnt seem too pleased.
Can I finish?
MOOPS,
Why not? Why not?
One mile from the exit it starts shaking, really violently shaking, like it's having a nervous breakdown. It completely stopped dead.
You think it's contact? It has to be touched?
George is in big trouble....
Who invaded Spain in the Eighth Century?
The old man got to me.
So, anything to uh, nosh?
Hehe. Well, I got my triangles. (sitting on the couch)
Well, you're not gonna believe what happened.
Then I asked her if she wanted a drink.
I dont know. All of em. Theyre all crooks! Besides, I couldnt get all different candy bars, anyway.
Thats beautiful.
Theyre my books.
Festivus, Sir. And, uh, I was afraid that I would be persecuted for my beliefs. They drove my family out of Bayside, Sir!
That was a hell of a thing when Spock died...
Look at these salesmen. The only thing these guys fear is the walk-out. No matter what they say, you say, "Ill walk out of here right now!"
Water coolers?
How about the old Spider Man live action show?
No I didn't mean to imply that you did. You're obviously a very well proportioned individual. I was just wondering, have they ever offered you a chair?
What a fascinating turn of events. (Waitress approaches)
Hi, we're from the United Volunteers, we've come to pick up the TV.
Would you stop it. (Susan playfully bites his ear lobe again) Would you quit it please. Someone is going to see us here.
Ma, people can hear you.
Thanks a lot. Ill give it back to you in a week.
So we'll do it tomorrow.
No one gives us the finger! We're Yankees!
(playing it cool) I'm still here.
Oh, Im crazy!
That's right. You ready?
C'mon, funny is funny.
I didn't know you were such a Bette Midler fan.
Elaine.
All right, I'm gonna find a guy with a truck. GLC must live on!
All right. You understand now? It's not that complicated.
My father had a car salesman buddy. He was gonna fix him up real nice. Next thing I know, Im gettin dropped of in a Le Car with a fabric sunroof. All the kids are shoutin at me, "Hey, Le George! Bonjour, Le George! Lets stuff Le George in Le Locker!"
I'm cheap? You think I'm CHEAP? How could you say that to me? I can't believe this. How could you say that to me?
I havent seen him for months.
She's not faking!
I still haven't figured him out.
I don't know.
No, not that I know of. (winks)
All right. That's more like it. Thank you very much. (giving the sponsor the 'be strong' hand clench) By the way, my uncle was an alcoholic, so...
Alright. 7,7, (points at himself) 6. I'm not gonna eat that much!
Ha! (snort) Can you believe it? (amused) I'm supposed to be havin' lunch with her right now at Pomodoro.
You almost did the nose.
Well, I have to see her.
Kramer, they like everybody. Theyre friendly people.
Never mind. The're done. All I have to do now is redo them. You know if you take everything I've ever done in my entire life and condense it down into one day, it looks decent.
That's right. I got his whole car downstairs.
(desperate) Please! I have so little!
What about the body, what kind of body?
100 p.m. Do you need any money?
But I had no... I didn't realize.
Yeah! Yeah!..Staten Island . What about my clothes ,how do I get the rest of the clothes?
Cheryl, Elaine, and uh, Jerry.
She hasnt eaten in two days.
(To Jerry) We got work to do. What about the meeting?
Oh, my God...
Okay, uh, eighteen dollars, and there it is. There you go. So maybe we could get together this weekend.
Wish I could. (raises the magazine up in front of his face and continues reading.)
Three days. Well, maybe you caught her on the cusp of a new wash cycle. You know, she did laundry the day after she met you, everything got clean and she started all over again.
What?
You know I still don't know how you can call lunch with me a business expense.
It won't for a while. At least not until after the cast comes off.
So, she doesnt move in.
Why not?
YYYDDSSHE(?) ... Jose Jimenez. You recognize it?
I thought you said one oclock.
All right, I?ll tell you what, you seem like a nice guy, let?s stop jerking around. Give me.. two hundred and fifty dollars, I?ve got people waiting for me, I've got to get the hell out of here.
Because if I watch it at my apartment I feel like I'm not doing anything. If I watch it here, I'm out of the house; I'm doing something.
(Getting frustrated) I know.
Aahh..No..No..
Nothing.
You're uh, physical therapist, right?
Really? Wow, you're quite the good son.
Heh, Mercury head. You mind?
So then what?
Wha... you're going?
I do.
What?
Boy oh boy.
Oh.
Very good. Go on.
Oh, come on.
(dread) Oh god.
That is so funny!
(to Jerry) Hey.
Every five years!
That's a good score.
You know a hug definitely good.
Wow.
Okay.
I am staying out all night!
Yes, yes, but uh, I have to make a call, so...
(urgent) Mr Wilhelm, listen. You've been abducted! Please, Mr Wilhelm, you gotta listen to me!
What, did you go swimmin'? It's 29 degrees out!
There it is. Gate 46... We got plenty of time.
Yap..
Hey listen... umm, instead of the movie... uh, maybe we'll go back and uh you know...(nudges her head with his head)
Please.
Guess who he put in charge of Fitted Hat Day? Me.
Let me see that. (Studies the note)
Time?
(sad) It's only four..
Just take it off. I'm getting hot just looking at it.
Why don't we talk about it another time.
Because of me? You must be joking! Who wouldn't want to live because of me? I'm nothing!
Neeson? How are you comparing Liam Neeson with Jon Voight? Jerry, we're talking about Joe Buck. If you can play Joe Buck, Oskar Schindler's a cake walk. (Opens the car door for Jerry, Jerry's about to get in.)
(as the others are repositioning the tables) No, no, you can't do that, they're round, it makes an 'eight' and, yeah, well alright.
Oh, the virgin?
It's disgusting--
I think I understand this. Jay Peterman is real. His biography is not. Now, you Kramer are real.
(still pleased) She doesn't know that. We say that you do.
Is that what's hurting your appreciation for the story?
No, Kramer. I have to have this statue.
(confused) What, what's going on?
No, you wont.
Outside of Manhattan, about an hour ago.
Its uh, it's only a few blocks.
Yeah, he's in my bed. I'm sleeping on the couch.
"Arrrrrrgh!! .. It's George.. Oh! Sports wholesaler. yeah. yeah. .. thanks for calling back. No , no , no still got the shoes, still got the shoes. Lots of them. This is.. beautiful athletic gear."
Yeah, I slept at my parents' house.
Eh, but, you know, Mr. Ross, if - if you look at the whole situating, what with it being your cigars, and everything, it's really rather ironic - one might even say, in a sense, comical.. (Mr. Ross has, by now, left the room. Mrs. Ross is pointing at George, nodding, laughing. As if to say he hit the bullseye. George calls out to Mr. Ross) Really. Think about it.
Of course.
Definitely.
But it--eh.. It was here, I'm tellin' you, an' w--w--it was really here! The, there was, a, bar, and a, an' a dance floor..
(forcing a laugh) Hu, ha.
Of course. So, Im looking at it. I look up, I see shes looking at it. Our eyes lock. It was a horrible moment. I just..
I cant stand doing laundry. Thats why I have forty pairs of underwear.
(sings) Co-stan-za. (like "By Mennen")
So, uh...wanna double?
(energetically) "Well seems it's about time for George's lunch."
What are you like a sadist? No matter how bad somebody feels, you can make 'em feel worse. I bet you're rooting for a tumor. (pointing to her)
That's right, of the New York Yankees.
(entering Monk's) Oh, hello, Hanke, others.
Why'd you pick Hoover? Was he that interesting to talk to?
What did you go out with me for?! Just to dump chocolate on my shirt and then just dump me altogether?! I don't deserve that kind of treatment! What, you don't have the common courtesy to return my calls?! To apologize! You think I'm some sort of a loser, that likes to be abused and ignored?! Who's shirt can be ruined without financial restitution?! Some sort of a masochist who enjoys being humiliated? You think you can avoid me like I have some sort of disease?! You have the disease! You have the disease! You may be beautiful and rich and physically .. just .. unbelievable, but you sicken me! You disgust me! You and everyone like you!
Hi.
No no no, no mistake, no mistake. No, no , listen, we're going to get married over Christmas, I It doesn't make any difference to me. It's fine. Really.
We'll have a good time
So, Lena was upset, huh?
(Chuckling) yeah. Uh, oh, here's your sunglasses. (Hands them to her)
No, no, no. He just left.
No, he doesn't know O'Brien, if he knew O'Brien he wouldn't have a sign. Let's just do it.
Here we go, LA.
All right. So, what theatre you wanna go to tonight? We got 61st and 3rd or 84th and Broadway.
Oh, I'll pay. Half-price. Arrivederci my fellow 40-short.
Well, was it for Costanza or...
I tried! I almost threw it down the incinerator, but I couldn't do it. The guilt was too overwhelming. (Grabs the doll, opening the door to leave) Susan's so attached to this thing.
What paper does she write for?
They're not mocked and humiliated when they get to the other side.
So eh, what do you say?
Hey, what are you doing tonight?
(Like a kid) Because I don't want to.
Well where is she?
It it's huge. It's probably like North Dakota.
I'm the consolation guy...?
Oh, no no, I cant go back there. Jerry, its so awkward and, you know, it could be dangerous sexually. Something could happen, Id be right back where I started from.
She wants to talk to you.
I'm leaving.
Yeah. Hey, let ask you something. Is it just me, or - or do you find it unbearable to be around Jerry and that girl?
Y'know the average life span for an American male is like, 72. You're really... kinda pushin' the envelope there.
Sounds like a cool guy.
I had nothing to do wtih any of this! I met all her friends, I didnt want to meet them. I kept trying to avoid it. I knew it would only get me in deeper. But they were everywhere! They kept popping up all over the place. This is Nancy, this is Susan, this is Amy, this is my cousin, this is my brother, this is my father... Its like Im in quicksand.
What?
What'd you do today, dad?
(forced buoyancy) Hey, you know, let's call Susan, we'll go have coffee.
All I know about is sports. That's it. No matter how depressed I get, I could always read the sports section.
Here, just give me a couple of napkins.
Severance package...The Yankees are giving me three months full pay for doing nothing.
Where?
Oh I'm seeing someone, yes. You know her, Daphne Bower.
Ah. You see, the man who was the butler, uh, had gotten into a car accident with Jerry, and because he didn't have any insurance, the judge decreed that the man become Jerry's butler.
All right, all right, I didnt want to tell you this. You wanna know why she called you?
Allllll right!
... so glad.
Damn it!
What?
He poked me!
How could I possibly interfere?
I dunno, Jerry somethin's missing. There's a void, Jerry, there's a void...
"Will you stop with the Jimmies"
Oh, me, me, me, me, me!
You know, it really can't.
Do you think it might be possible to add a little shelf like, uh, for an alarm clock?
How could that piece of *crap* cost $98.00!?
(after hesitating, resignedly) All right. (He sits down and smiles unconvincingly at her)
Yeah, drove away.. You know, I said 'Hello' to him. You know, he's - he's-
I guarantee you that Moses was a picker. You wander throughh the desert for forty years with that dry air. ... You telling me you're not going to have occasion to clean house a little bit.
Y'know what it is? It's "Clara Nightingale Syndrome." He falls ill; she falls in love.
How can I do this? How can I move back in with those people? Please, tell me. They're insane. You know that.
Now, stop it ...
You're luscious. You're ravishing. I would give up red meat just to get a glimpse of you in a bra. Im terribly sorry. (both George and the attractive female applicant stand up as George reaches across the desk and shakes her hand for coming in)
I tell you, when she threw that toupee out the window, it was the best thing that ever happened to me. I feel like my old self again. Totally inadequate, completely insecure, paranoid, neurotic, it's a pleasure.
Why?! Because you were stabbed, and.. got coffee thrown in your face, and.. uh.. (Points to Alan's bandaged forehead)
Alright, start looking for spaces.
Maybe hes resting.
Ask about you, ask about you.
Yes he is. Let me ask you something. When you come out of the shower and you put your robe on, do you cinch it real tight, are you concerned about that?
They all have swirling chocolate in the commercial!
Hey.
Are you sure?
Like what?
Ta _ mal _ e!
"The hell with them?"
Where did you get those?
(yells) I didn't tattle
(worried now) No sir.
Were having lunch with a friend. He works in the building.
What about these?
Will I call you when I get home? ha ha What do you think? ee, you kill me kill me
Yeah, what is he? Some sort of an instigator?
Not as good. That's when you realize all the money you're losing.
Theyre the ones who should be ashamed. They signed me to a one-year contract. As long as I show up for work every day, they have to pay me.
What?
I'm sorry, Jerry I can't help you.
Is that so? Or could it be that you're just a *little* bit worried that you may have missed the boat?
What?
The parakeet in the mirror. That's a good one, Stu.
I loved her Jerry, I loved her.
Really?
Assistant to the travelling secretary. (fishing for a reaction) I'm uh, working on the project.
What?
(Scoffs) No, I told you, I'm not gonna do that.
Well, I shouldn't have to pay for it!
I just feel terrible This is just terrible.
Yeah. What time is it?
Yeah, well...a little rough finding something good in your price-range. (to Jerry) But you, my friend, may be in luck.
He's alright?
The Duty Free Shop? Duty Free is the biggest sucker deal in retail. Do you know how much duty is?
We really should be, uh, heading out..
Sorry. Thank you.
Ive had my difficulties.
Oh, no no no. I was just looking for stock-pages. Here it is. Looking for the quotes. Gotta check to quotes. Love a good quote. Oh, IBM up a quarter.
Where the hell is this car, Kramer?
Hey, look at this. This is the same massage chair we're gettin' for Joe Mayo, $60 cheaper.
I wouldn't hear of it, Todd. It's none of my business. But you should try to find out everything you possibly can. In fact, I'll even stay all the way on the other side of the room just so there's no chance of me overhearing anything.
Wait a minute Jerry, there's a bigger issue here. If you go through that wall and become one of those guys I'll be left here on this side. Take me with you.
I'd love to be a Civil War buff. ... What do you have to do to be a buff
Right.
What do you wanna do?
Hey, it's George.
(smiling) So, you know, what, what happened?
Where? (He looks out window and gets hit by a tomato)
Yeah.
(Staring at the doll) This doll (Pointing) looks like my mother.
(sobbing) yodel lay hee hoo..
Its a great thrill to meet you, Sir.
You open the door to the car, boom, you walk right into the hospital. Eh, You can't beat that spot. (starts doing a little dance) I am on a roll. I'm just willing these great parking spots.
I'm not getting on a regular plane now - I'm all psyched up to go on a private jet. No way I'm getting on a regular plane.
(confused, to himself) Like me? But how?
(singing)  Master of the house/Keeper of the inn... (Jerry re-enters the living room and modestly models his new jacket for George. George is impressed.) This is huge! When did this happen?
I can't
Tough.
Five hundred dollars, that?s a great deal!
Actually I think I'm gonna take a few days off (starts to leave)
(to Claire) Now, a woman calls me, all right?
So I spoke a little to your little friend Denise last night.
Would you buy my Cayman Island ticket?
We discussed toilet paper.
Well don't let him take advantage of you like that.
I can't go in there. Im too uncomfortable.
Yeah, but you know where it is.
Yes!
This hat just bottles in the heat, I -I don't even need a coat! It's unbelievable!
Yes she is. It's a pity we won't be seeing much more of her.
Susan wants me to be there.
And now?
How did you know that?
Popcorn?
I, I, I can't.
Well I didnt do it for my mother.
I walked.
Blanket.
...pianist. A *classical* pianist. She *plays* the piano. She's a *brilliant* woman. I-I-I sat in her living room... She played the *Waldstein Sonata*! The *Waldstein*!
(sitting down next to Jerry) Seeing Maura. Apparently, I was unable to break up beyond a reasonable doubt.
No. Nothing. Fine. (he sits at the table)
That, or Whos bra is this?
Oh, come on. What, are you kidding? GEORGE I'm much more comfortable criticizing people behind there backs. Anyway, look who's talking. You just broke up with with Melanie last week because she "shuushed you" while you were watching TV.
Yeah. Right.
Well, I don't see how I'm gonna make December. I mean, I need a little more time. I mean, look at me I'm a nervous wreck. My stomach aches. My neck is killing me. I can't turn. Look. Look.
I noticed people staring at my head because they like what they see.
Oh, yeah? Holistic.. that's what I need. That's the answer.
(Smiling to himself) You don't have to worry about me. (Nodding, gloating) I won a contest.
Jerry Lewis?
Sorry we're late.
Now?
What? You mean with a knife?
That's why we're here in America.
Pulp can move, Baby! Why didn't you eat a real breakfast?
Rosses.
(glances in mirror) Alright. Alright.
All right, I gotta make a call. Everybody out, come on.
You heard the man. I guess you gotta be moving your car.
Boy - I'm really surprised at Elaine - that whole phone business - she should know better than that.
Okay.
How can you call yourself a clown and not know who Bozo is?
Maybe it's not even stupidity. Maybe it's just a blatant disregard for basic human decency. Yeah this how dictator's start. Do you think Mussolini would circle the block six times looking for a spot?
But I digress. Let me see, now. You were standing at one end of the line and I was right next to you. And I remember we were even for like, the first five yards and then , BOOM,...You were gone.
I told you, he probably went out the back.
Oh, Hey, hey, hey! That's great! That's very nice. You know we've been waiting twenty minutes for you people?! What do you think, you're Mussolini?!
I got to get downtown and buy that suit. The store opens in twenty minutes.
...she calls me up at my office
No problem.
Dark and disturbed? His whole life revolves around Superman and cereal. I convinced him to act like that so that you would think I was funnier. That's how disturbed I am! If you want disturbed, that's disturbed. You can't find sickness like that anywhere, you think sickness like that grows on trees? Nobody is sicker than me, nobody. He's pretending, I'm the genuine article.
Fine, I'll buy a pack of gum.
Hey that's swell.
I told her I liked her. Why? Why did I tell her I like her? I have this sick compulsion to tell women how I feel. I like you I dont tell you.
Well, they were in a rush.
Hey, shut up.
I can't carry a pen. I'm afraid I'll puncture my scrotum.
Well, is he good, Kramer?
Oh I think I'd go for the back.
What is this? Did you ever get the feeling like you've had a haircut but you didn't have one? I'm all itchy back here.
I tell you; I'm wiped.
So, they knew? Those liars!
This must be Sheila from the photo place.
I thought Kramer was watching.
3 days.
I shouldn't even tell you this.
What's with all these flags?
Oh, no...no, that's very bad for the kidneys.
What are we gonna do? How are we gonna get out of here?
(looking at the door) He's starin' at us.
Had to come in and maybe well get together? Had to and maybe?
Who was he?
No kidding?
I got to go.
Yes.
She hasn't seen the article! When she sees it, she's gonna think-- *I'm out baby*!! I'm out!!!!!
I zipped up!
Live?
Who's got the receipt?
Really? My father has a ton of old clothes just sitting up in the attic, y-you think they're worth something?
He called in sick.
(from bathroom) VANDELAY, SAY VANDELAY!
Oh, oh, your papers
What are you crazy?
She said looks aren't important to her?
The whole time that I was growing up, all I ever heard from my mother was 'Why can't you be more like that Lloyd Braun?'
How 'ya feelin'?
Well, Jerry doesn't want anyone to know.
Heh, haa. And that's no good. I've tried it straight, Jerry. We've all seen the results. For me, sick is the only way to go.
Somebody double parked and blocked us in. D-DOES ANYBODY KNOW WHOSE CAR THAT IS? Maybe there's a note on it. Ohh-oh brother. No, no note. Can you believe this?
Jerry, let's face it, I've always been handicapped. I'm just now getting the recognition for it. Name one thing I have that puts me in a position of advantage. Huh? There was a guy that worked at the Yankees-- no arms! He got more work done than I did, made more money, had a wife, a family, drove a better car than I did.
I gotta get out of this city.
But now I have my own market research. Actual Japanese viewers, that love the show! I'm gonna talk to Kramer.
hey
Ahhhhh...
Whatever. (George looks to the table) Hey new tape recorder?
They could've at least tried!
Please, it's not necessary.
(tormented) Aw, shut up Jerry! Just shut up!
Right.
No, you didnt!
What idea? I just said something. I didn't know you were going to listen to me.
I swear, I swear!
Come on, how hard is that? Look at all the junk that's on TV. You want an idea? Here's an idea. You coach gymnastics team in high school. And you're married. And your son's not interested in gymnastics and you're pushing him into gymnastics.
Hunh, You know, it's the damnedest thing. I went out the window again to, to get a cup of coffee...
Oh my God. I must be crazy. What have I done?
He has no home. He's a squirrel.
Yeah, Art Vandelay.
A bubble boy?
Lunch is fine at the beginning then you move on to dinner. you don't move back to lunch. It's like being demoted. I'll never do another crossword puzzle with her again. I know it.
Oh, well, he was probably just getting anxious to start his vacation.
A stock.
(still in Jacks voice) I'm working on my Jack Nicholson, You can't handle the truth! (he salutes)
It's like some pod landed from another planet and took your body. Don't fall asleep Elaine.
What if it rains?
Jerry! Over here Jerry. It's me!
(excited) So then, as we were leaving, we were just kind of standing there, and she was sort of smiling at me, and I wasnt sure if she wanted me to ask her out, because when women smile at me I dont know what it means. Sometimes I interpret it like theyre psychotic or something and I dont know if Im supposed to smile back, I dont know what to do. So I just stood there like  remember how Quayle looked when Benson gave him that Kennedy line? Thats what I looked like.
An idea.
Well, Jerry, I been thinkin'. I've gotten as far as I can go with George Costanza.
So you think she likes me?
Should I apologize to Woody?
Great. (They both stand.) Oh, by the way, did you get a chance to read the script?
Ben Cantwell. 85. Huh... You think we'll make it to that age?
This woman left this really sexy message on Jerry's tape recorder......
Why don't you just look at your watch?
Still lookin'. It's pretty bad out there. What about you?
Nah.
Five-hundred dollars?! What?
And, um, it was quite good. In fact, you even incorporated me into the show. I'm not actually a performer. Although, my parents felt I had talent..
Like us. (Elaine enters)
(walking towards the door) I couldn't leave well enough alone?!
It's all your fault! You and Elaine! All that orgasm talk. She did have an orgasm, she didn't have an orgasm. Orgasm this, orgasm that. I got so focused on it. I started to panic and boom, I lost it. I tried everything, I was talking to him 'Please wake up, do something.'
Yeah, had some coffee, yeah.
I wasn't going to say anything, but then I could see that he wasn't going to open his mouth. (Chuckles)
Ah, I guess I should go up and apologize.
(to passerby) Hey, he-hah. It's June, June.
(laughs) Youd have to be a real loser to try something like that.
I can't believe she got involved with a shrink.
What's all this?
No-no Jerry. I wouldn't do that.
(thoughtful) I have no idea.
May I just use your bathroom for a moment?
Who would Want to. She tried to end it with me, Jerry.
Yeah, what do you do when you run out of laundry?
Mint?
Well, not recently. I craved. I crave all the time, constant craving...but I haven't yearned.
What?
Hey, Elaine. Maybe his girlfriend is Lois Loan.
It's beautiful. She makes all the plans. I'm not from around here so it's okay if I'm stupid, and she knows I'm only in town visiting so there's no messy breakup
Oh, so it backfired?
(laughs-hu) So when're you gonna see her?
Oh no, Mr.Steinbrenner, I can explain...
Hey, the Bull owes me one, I helped him with his swing.
(he drops a paper airplane he was holding) Mr. Wilhelm!
I have to say, as a glasses wearer I take exception to that. That's like me buying a wheelchair to cruise around in.
Yes, and I'm speaking at a men's' conference.
He might as well have! I caught him, and his face was covered in chocolate and cookie crumbs.
Well, you know. You get to a certain point, you wanna know about your roots.
Jerry? Why?
All right.
Hey by the way my parents really want to have your parents over dinner before they leave town.
I guess it's on my resume.
Jerry! Oh, my God! What are you doing!?!
What does she look like?
(Hands Antonio a card) Here's my card. I'm in real estate, so, if you're ever looking for something bigger, something nicer.. (Antonio is staring at him, angered) ..maybe not right now. Anyway.. (Extends his hand for a handshake. Antonio doesn't move)
All right, all right.
Did you see the way she pointed at the check? She gave me the finger.
Dead?
OK Look, the gum isn't cutting it for me. We need to be about something else...anything..please.
Yea.
Oh, yeah. You wish you had this coat.
(worked up) Because if she gets it back, then you'll have no reason to be sour. You'll de-sour, right?
(neither does he) Yeah, well.
That's right.
Ech. What else you got?
Well you see he slipped, and he landed on a kinda of a..
So, he made an appointment for me to see Dinkins' doctor. He's just trying to humiliate me.
I'm not following.
51 people?! That's it?! I thought it was, like, a thousand!
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Because, if you ever see her and it comes up, we have to be in sync. Hmm?
But Kramer, isn't it a question of hygiene?
You don't have your own camera.
I figured you'd cruise. At least through the Spring.
What about the whole Christmas spirit thing? Any flexability there?
I dont think theres ever been an appointment in my life where I wanted the other guy to show up. (George notices an elderly man in a leather chair.) Wait a second, is that him?
Wow, Keith Hernandez. He's such a great player.
Hennigans. I was there sitting in the office and the cleaning woman comes in. I've always been attracted to cleaning women. Cleaning women, chambermaids.
I've done that. Did you ever eat an ostrich burger?
What, wha, what're you talkin' about?
(frustrated) Take it easy! Huh! Take it easy!
I sold your clothes yesterday.
That's my whole afternoon! I was going to look for sneakers.
Look at this.
Oh that's eh, that's a sandwich.
(Eating a sandwich) Oh, like you really know busboys.
Well, if she was a criminal and you had to describe her to a police sketch artist...
I gotta get to Fowler. I know that he would take this squirrel off my hands. It's practically bionic!
I tell you what, you give me the twenty, and I will buy *you* a popcorn and soda, and I'll throw in a bon-bons.
Well, it frees me up. No encumbrances.
(grabbing his jacket) Hey oo, I just remembered uh my parents really wanna have you guys over for dinner before you leave town. What about tonight?
(through a mouthful of shrimp) Well, why don't we just put a monitor in his skybox?
Moops!
Right out of the clear blue sky?
What? Oh, My God!
Is it flowing? I like flowing, cascading hair. Thick lustrous hair is very important to me.
(pleasant surprise) Really? (admonishing) You know Gary, I really have to say, I'm a little bit hurt that you didn't decide to confide in me.
We need to talk.
She's stickin' it to me that she makes more money than me.
Ya
You see?.. You see?!
(to the other laundry patrons) Any questions?
All right. You wanna know what one of her favorite expressions is? Happy, Pappy?
No, no. It wasn't a shift, I've shifted, this was a move.
Do you hear yourself?
It strikes me a lot of guys are doing that kind of humor now.
So countries just exchange gifts like that?
Oh yeah.
If you don't mind, sir. I'll be here at 8.
Maybe he's just "very well RED"?
Yeah.
I don't know.
Yes, inte-- h-how inte-- how integral?
Lena, how'd you meet her?
What for?
You could do worse!
I think they really went for that Soda.
(Aggravated) Well, I got screwed on the donuts. There were none left. Heh!
Yeah. So what's going on? We're gonna shoot the pilot and then it's gonna be on TV the following week?
Yes, a rosy glow.
It's about nothing.
Yes Mr. Hayman.
Oh!, so what. I'd rather she hate me and thought I was good looking....At least I can get somebody else. (scratching his chest) What is this? Why am I itching?
(knocking on the counter and feigning a muffled, Chinese voice) Chinese food!
Okay, okay. Look, you do all the talking, okay?
So are you going to Todd's party this weekend?
Well, we just blew 240 bucks on a wheelchair.
(almost gleeful) After Dinkins lost the election, he had a complete nervous breakdown. They had to lock him up.
I saw them making out, you can believe it.
I love that bathroom. It's got that high, high toilet. I feel like a gargoyle perched on the ledge of a building.
Im okay. Im fine. Im wonderful. I never felt better in my whole life.
Ha ha. Everything's timed out to perfection, Jerry. Slippery Pete's got the Frogger running on battery power, the truck will be there any minute, and Kramer's taped out the loading zone.
It's a big region.
(Defensively) Whatever.
What if there is a fire?
Yeah. Steinbrenner wants everyone in the front office to give a lecture in their area of business expertise.
Alright, let's go.
Oh are they gonna be furious.
Laundry? Dry cleaning?
how did ya?...
You wanted to see me, sir?
No I can't. I can't die with dignity. I have no dignity. I want to be the one person who doesn't die with dignity. I live my whole life in shame. Why should I die with dignity?
But tell him to give me the--
Monica, I'm really focused here, this stuff's a killer. (turns to the next page)
Woo! Some day out there - You ever see weather like that? Woo! It's crisp - it's crispy crisp.
Instinct.
Ow. My eye, my eye.
Without his shirt on.
Yeah, yeah, the flower guy. Listen, I know this all sounds a little crazy, but...
You know, anything in the, in the lip area is good.
I'm the opposite of every guy you've ever met.
As you will see, the candy bar is paid for, and yet, remains dangling in the machine. (Notices that the Twix slot is completely empty) Hey, its gone. Where is my Twix? (Quickly looks around. His sights fall on the window of a door labeled "Employees Only". The same mechanic from before is eating a candy bar) What?! That guys eatin it!
Laguardia? All right, let's go. C'mon...
Are you supposed to yell it?
Yeah?
Now, each of you is here because you're the best at what you do.
No no no, this ones different. This ones a beauty!
Yeah.. They made me sick.
Oh my god, maybe Gwen saw it. Maybe that's what did it.
That's why the world's in the shape it's in.
Would you mind helping me out with some of this stuff?!?
Oh, no. No no no no no. Id have to advise against that. What, do you know this woman a month? Lets see, youre going to be with her seventy-two hours. Thats a dating decathlon.
I got a big problem here, Jerry. The tapes are worthless.
Oh.
He doesn't feel funny.
It's just not good, it's not good.
No! It, uh, it wouldn't fit you.
Alright, whatever! Now. Whatever caused the damage...(drops a tiny briefcase onto the table in the model)...was jarring enough to completely stop the tape.
Well I don't know anyone here Jerry. Where else am I going to stay?
Me too. I've been yelling at strangers on the street.
No, not nice. She's stickin' it to me.
The nice one that works in my office.
Oh, not more building.
(pondering) Yes I suppose they do.
What happened to Mrs. Krantz?
Well I think it would be nice if there was some kind of historical record of it.
I-I don't know.
Oh, there's better, (pointing at the row in front of them) right there, that's better.
I don't know why Rachel had to drive back with Michael and Carol.
I know it's a doll, but it looks like my mother!
Okay. "Breakfast At Tiffany's." (Begins to read, but gradually his attention is drawn to the TV Guide on the end table. George realizes there's a show on he wants to see by looking at his watch, and doesn't start the book.)
You're gonna tell me...or not.
Now my parents are gonna know I had people over.
Well I guess that's because I wear boxer shorts.
Yeah! Right!
What's it gonna be?
(emerging from bathroom, buttoning his shirt) A gymnast! I can't believe it, you didn't tell me she was a gymnast.
I think he was impressed.
So we had a good time... the four of us.
--and this is Kramer.
Well, I assume there's some sort of write-off.
If I do it, will you buy a computer?
Day was -
(frustrated) Oh, look at this. There's no place to park around here. I don't even know why they sell cars in Manhattan.
Well, I can't walk anywhere now. I'm just gonna be wishing there were walkways. (seeing Elaine removing her shoe) What are you doing?
Susan, Susan would you wai,....
Yeah. It's a beautiful name for a boy or a girl...
That's gotta hurt!
Because my cousin's imbecile dog was rolling around outside and they got in his carpet.
(smiling) What about Sharon Besser?
What's with all the butter?
Then I see my clothes floating out there. The tied took them out, not the kids.
He still wins but it's not a blowout.
All right. I'm gonna try givin' them fifty-five dollars each... (to Elaine) What do you think?
What?
Hey, hey, hey! You don't call me back?!
Never mind.
I'm sorry the card says MOOPS.
What about the regards?
You got aloe? I love aloe.
Thanks. What are you guys doin' here?
We were in the lobby during the intermission of the play. I was buying her one of those containers of orange drink, for five dollars. I reached into my pocket to pay for it, I looked down; theres this piece of green floss hanging from my fingers.
I was just curious.
Yeah. No problem.
Ah, see, Mister.. I didn't write that report. That, that's not mine.
Art.
(sobbing) yodel lay hee hoo..
No good? All right, uh how about Art... Cor.....
Yes. Yes. Care. You know who I think about a lot? Remember SUSAN ? The one that used to work for NBC?
I saw Amy making out with your cousin Jeffrey.
Huh, he's a communist. . . . Look at this. "Exciting uninhibited woman seeks forward thinking comrade and appearance not important." . . . Appearance Not Important! This is unbelievable. Finally this is an ideology I can embrace.
Well I didn't know you wanted to go to the flea market.
Well, Jerry's car gets hit and the other driver doesn't have any insurance, so the judge
That's not how it happened. It's when he fell on him with his knee.
What am I supposed to get, a bazooka?
You know, you go out, you get another rye. Of course, it would have to be the same one from Schnitzer's. You put it in the kitchen somewhere and you say Ohh! There it is.
Ya, ya. I bumped into him on the bus. What did he have to say?
Was she uh, was she a big, uh woman?
Can I say one word to you? Lobster. The lobster here is unbelievable. (looks at the menu) Ooh, a little expensive.
Wait a minute. (astonished) You're thinking of moving to Florida again?!
Alright, what are we getting? It's hot in here!
You tell Russell.
No. No it's not. You don't know this guy. It woulda been so sweet.
See, I think people would talk about it at the coffee machines.
Oh, you haven't heard, she's going to live with her grandparents in Redding Pennsylvania.
(calling to Susan) Uh, ah, nothing. Nothing.
Great! (snaps fingers and grabs the extra plane ticket) Nina could go, huh? Jerry, this is great. You and Elaine. Me and Nina.
Yes, full. I love to be full ... love to sit back, loosen the old belt and digest away for hours. Let those enzymes do their work.
What's the difference?
Is it that obvious?
I think those are my socks!
Excuse me, the guy is wearing a jacket that my friend is...
Well...
I can't believe this.
You know how hot it gets there? Like 150 degrees. Your skin is gonna be simmering with boils.
Kinda busy here.
Now I know what I am supposed to do. It's so simple. Tell the truth That's all. Just tell the truth
Ouch!
This catalog is all about how to score in a foreign country.
What are they gonna do?
Hey, do you know, Bonnie, I just had a pretty wild idea.
It's impossible. I got him a wake up service.
That's it?
Funny, cause I happen to be very good friends with Keith Hernandez.
It's, uh, it's not a little chicken. (laughing) Little chicken. It's a gamebird.
Kramer, listen to me. I'm never gonna have a child. If I lose this Frogger high score, that's it for me.
(Interested) I should!
I did it. Hunh, we're going out as soon as she gets off of work and it'll still be daytime. You know I, Im much better in the daytime then I am at night. it's less pressure.
No, no. I'm just thinking.
I'm not paying for this. If you were going out with her, it'd be a different story.
It's a blue Honda...
I think I'll have a piece of cake.
I think that's mine.
Hey, hey, let's not get so defensive here. This is a give and take process.
Really?
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. As long as youre going to lie to the guy, why dont you tell him that you lost both of the tickets, then we can go?
Well, I just had a fight - I need a group dynamic.
He forced me to!
I should probably get going too. If I don't feed Pequita by seven, she goes all over everything.. take it easy.
Something happened to the food?
I can't go anywhere, I have to wait here for Tatiana's call. Let me just check.
Im starving. You got any of those free donuts you use to soften people up?
I change I change. Two weeks ago I tried a soft boiled egg. Never liked it before. Now I'm dunkin a piece of toast in there and I'm loving it.
Uh.
Hey, I've done that today.
No no no, I got it.
That's the sign! The test; if a - if a man makes it move.
Two tickets to "Guys And Dolls"! I'm gonna go with you!
I'm, you know, engaged.
Well, this I take to the grave.
... She's got it stashed away in there somewhere.
May I help you?
Sand. It's everywhere
You know, we could go uptown, and that way we could give Jerry a ride home.
(excited) Great news! I showed the pilot to Kramer's Japanese friends. They loved it!
I think she finds my stupidity charming.
(clears his throat)
No, I dont want it. I want it, if you dont want it.
He's giving you furniture? Who is this guy?
(Looks at her) Yeah, uh, no menus. (Waves her off)
My place? NO, no, no. I hate my place. I don't wanna go back to my place.
No reason!
Sorry? Why sorry? What you got to be sorry about?
I know, I know and you know *why* they're moving there?
Velvet...
Smoking.
(to Jerry) What do you mean by that?
Oh, of course. (motioning Estelle to enter) Of course.
It's the same movie! What's the difference?
Oh my god....
I love when they touch your arm. I can't get enough of that. Why is that?
Thats all there is to it. By Christmas day I will be Brother Costanza.
Jerry, you gotta talk to Sitarides.
I was jumping over a puddle, and for some reason I went like this. (George stretches out his arms in a ballet motion) And they called me a Mary. So I chased them, and I tripped and I fell.
I know what the problem is - I like her too much. That's why I can't make a move.
I just wanted to talk to him for a minute, but Ill come back.
That's my vow to you.
I had to give it to the liquor store guy.
Yes. Well -- So, uh, sit on the same side at a booth, huh?
You want your blankets tucked in?
I tought I saw a face.
This is what my life has come to... Tryin to meet a mute.
Pop! POP!!
(Trying to whisper to Jerry) Look, we are gonna settle this right now! I demand reparations! I should get to sleep with Elaine. That's the only way to punish you!
I can't be blind, Jerry The blind are courageous.
Well if Houdini couldn't do it, what chance do I have?
They're reorganizing the staff, and I'm on thin ice with this guy as it is.
You're not out there! You can't be, because *I* am out there. And if I see *you* out there, there's not enough voltage in this world to electroshock me back into coherence!
Whooo.. (To a waitress taking orders) Ooh.. French fries.
Ya it used to be right in the middle of single Jeopardy and now they do it right after single Jeopardy.
I know. Don't you see. (emphatic) He was doing it to fool Lloyd Braun!
Sorry, we're a little late. We got so hung up in traffic.
But you took me back.
What if he's waiting for me outside? He pointed at me! Did you see him point?!
It never ends, this present stuff! Engagement present! Then they get married, you gonna have to get them something for that! Then the baby, there's another present. Then the baby starts getting their presents. I don't even like Drake.
(still quiet) Never mind, never mind. I need you to do me a favour. Uhm, remember what we were talking about at the coffee shop earlier?
What?
Hope he's not the guy.
(Outraged) "That's all"?! That's everything! I don't know what all the rest of it is for anyway!
I'm writin' it. "How's it going?"
I'm emotional.
Yeah, I'm fine.
Heh heh heh hey, new suit (raises coffee cup as a salute / toast)
I got me an appointment with a hardware store. I'm not saying I want to do it for the rest of my life, but, uh, hardware fascinates me. Don't you love to make a key?
Now everyone's going to think we're gay!
Oh, this is fabulous. My God Elaine, you have to taste this.
Oh ah, I uh, will have that for you by after lunch.
(confused) What does that mean?
Alright, alright!
Well, I'm the good boy again. Can you believe that?
You're smart, I'm dumb.
Can you uh, go in the bubble?
Oh, nothing happened, but it was...
So, they didn't give you a piece of cake? Big deal.
They will get a good home won't they?
I think I like the girl better than the voice.
She's been locked up for two years. She's gonna want to make up for lost time. Dinners. Movies. (Rubs his forehead.) Talking...
A counter-clockwise swirl.
Hey, I'm sorry, you had your buffer zone for many years. It's my turn to live, baby.
But she's gonna know that I like her more than she likes me.
The Jon Voight car is no more.
JERRY! What happened to you?
I hope I am.
You're an alcoholic! You have to apologize. Step Nine! Step Nine.
Only I hold the answer key to their true candy identities. And so, without further ado, I give you the candy line-up. (Opens a door to a back room. Various dealership employees are munching on candy bars)
Really?
... Those spastic shnitzer twins ...
"throws your hips off kilter" So where's your money? (pulls out his wallet)
I'd like to hear that.
So, you send me to this therapist to help me with my emotional disorders, and she criticizes our script. (Tosses the script to Jerry.) What kind of a therapist is that?
Who do you like?
There's Elaine.
Of course he liked it.
Theres just no justice. This experience has changed me. Its made me more cynical, more bitter, more jaded.
I put my pants on, Sid.
Oh, Tara!
How can you compare you parents to my parents?!
Really? How'd she do that?
(seeing Jerry's van shaking) What is that? That van's a-rockin'.
I should be in a place like this. I envy this woman. Ya' get to wear slippers all day. Friends visit. They pity you. Pity is very underrated. I like it it's good. Plus they give you those word association tests. I love those.
Thinking? Nothing. What could I possibly be thinking?
Italian.
Hey, is it my imagination, or do really good looking women walk a lot faster than everybody else?
How's it going?
Hey. How come I didn't get a Christmas card? Everybody else got one. Jerry got one, Kramer got one. I thought we were good friends. I don't get a Christmas card. I don't get it.
Eight o'clock.
What are you talking about? How can you sit there and look me in the eye and tell that me you're not worried?! Don't you have any *sense*?!! Don't you have a brain!? Are you so completely senile that you don't know what you're talkin about Anymore!!?!
Oh. What is this?
You spritz a little Lysol on it.
It's like you're livin' in the Playboy Mansion! Did she, uh, did she frolic?
(gleeful) Hehee. W..we could be like the Gatsbys. Didn't they always like, you know, a bunch of people around, and they were all best friends?
Because she asked me to.
Well, you know, I was thinking about what you said before, and...you're right, I've never really been a couple, so...if that's the rule, then I'm gonna go by the rule.
No, wait!
Why did France give that to us anyway?
So what?! She still gave you advice; what's the difference if she's not Chinese?!?!
You see that woman on the horse? (points)
(Again, sarcastic) Oh, what a huge blow to the culture.
. . . she scooped her niblets?
The point is I was here first.
All right, I've got to go down to the unemployment office. Wanna take a walk?
So call her up and tell her to bring you another one. She'll be delighted to talk to you.
And how does the baldness fit into that plan?
Ha, Yeah right, hang on, Ill ah, Ill get her for you. he, he, he, he. Seriously, what's up?
(Laughs slightly) A physician married to a salesman. (Chuckles) Well, I gotta tell you, Beth, you coulda done a lot better than him.
I don't understand things were going so great. What happened? Something must have happened.
Yeah, well I uh got lots of other stuff to show you too. Wait till you see the plum job that I landed.
Well, uh, are there any other options?
Nine sixty? Give it to me.
What the hell happened?
Me, uh, uh, no, ...
She told you she doesn't like me!
It's like, all dented.
I broke up with her.
Can't live!
(feigning happiness) The second I see him.
Oh yeah the nipple. But besides that. How did you feel about Kramer's work?
uh oh..
April.
Jerry, for all I know this guy went out of his way to not invite you. How am I gonna feel if I show up with an uninvited, unwelcome intruder?
No something is bunk and then you debunk it.
You coulda damaged my hand!
Yes. And listen to this, listen to this; her uncle works for the Yankees and he's gonna get me a job interview. A front office kind of thing. Assistant to the traveling secretary. A job with the New York Yankees! This has been the dream of my life ever since I was a child, and it's all happening because I'm completely ignoring every urge towards common sense and good judgment I have had. This is no longer just some crazy notion. Elaine, Jerry, this is my religion.
Isn't that that Bania guy?
(entering the apartment more fully) Oh. Oh, hi, hi. Hi. Nice to meet you. (peering at the table) What're you having, veal?
Well, what are you gonna do?
Ohh, hey there, young fella. (They shake hands) What's your major?
No, you're not taking a deli slicer to my boss...
Oh!
What is with this family?
(he thinks a little about it... and as he puts his hand on his knee and gets up) I'm sorry Karen. I know I care for you, but I just can't stand when someone doesn't like me. (he opens the door)
It's supposed to be a good party.
(To Estelle) Scissor. (She gets the scissors from the coffee table and hands them to George with the point facing him) Don't hand them to me with the point facing out!
(Resenting the fact. Nodding) I am aware.
How you doing?
(a little worried) He uh, he doesn't have the auto shop any more?
Ah, shut up.
I'm going shopping with Susan.
What-what are you doing?
(adamant) It's not cheating if there's no sex!
The nickname. George. What is that? It's nothing. It's got no snap, no zip. I need a nickname that makes people light up.
What hat?
He's a jerk. (nudges to his right but no one is there)
Jerry, what are you doing...
What?
Conveyor belt.
Hnn! Let me see that.
Ssssso, after me, you... went that way?
I didn't burn it down - Kramer did!
Or something. I said, Or Something!
Why, the color?
Jerry? I have to tell you something. This is the dullest moment Ive ever experienced.
But this is Pavarotti!
Oh Jerry, that is so sweet of you but actually i already ate.
Well, I told it to Susan before, and she didn't like it.
Do you?
Ah, ah, twenty to three.
After dark? Please. At their age, that's like swallowing stun grenades.
S'cuse me ..Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?
Oh, no no no, I haven't even seen her apartment yet. Tomorrow night's the first night.
Are you kidding me? [Elaine walks past the window glancing in] This is the best tool we have today of measuring a persons' intelligence.
I just remembered, I gotta be someplace. Yuh-hu-hur, that's enough. Pop. Pop, put down the wrench, Pop.
Weren't you supposed to call Elaine?
(Relieved) I haven't? I'm okay? I'm okay? Oh, thank you, thank you, Doctor! I don't know how to thank you.
Hey.
Ah hah. You see Father, Im Im incredibly anxious to become a member. Um, dont you offer any kind of an express conversion? A quick change?
(whistling)
Listen. I want you guys to send along those agreements the minute you land. Our boys can't wait to kick your butts!
Blimp The Hindenburg Story.
I wasn't talking to you.
No, that's right, I didn't. I take full responsibility for the card not being here. I, uh, . . .
Do women know about shrinkage?
Ya know, I was just a little surprised.
Like retouched.
Yeah, and a whole new me. I'm up two inches in these babies!
(aggravated) Oh, that's not good enough! You don't try and de-sour. You have to sweeten too!
Great. Jerry, I gotta tell you, I had the BEST TIME with that Nina last night. I - I think I'm in love with her already. You are a great friend. (Hugs Jerry) A great, great friend.
Jerry, would you make the call already?
Yeah, hell have my parents.
That's right.
Pass the salt please.
Napkins?
I mentioned how I liked horse manure.
Kramer, please.
Yes, please.
What if I'm at the bottom?
I am different, yeah.
Really?
Oh, deserve! I don't know if I deserve...I mean...
Yeah?
Well, you know Katy, Elaine's friend?
That's okay. That's good. You think Louie Pasteur and his wife had anything in common? He was in the fields all day with the cows, you know with the milk, examining the milk, delving into milk, consummed with milk. Pasteurization, Homogenization, She was in the kitchen killing cockroaches with a boot on each hand.
Oh, come on! Be sensible.
Leslie.
Elaine, get off the speaker! (Elaine picks up phone)
Food?
Why'd I think it was timbre? Yeah, she could do voiceover commercials, why didn't you tell me about her voice?
Well...not "out." She's a prisoner.
Let's see, How I'm very good at going in reverse in my car, why isn't Postum a more popular drink,
(still by the door) What? M-Maura, what are you doin' here? I ended this relationship... twice!
OK, OK, I never even had him for gym.
Id love to go. Make an appointment.
Don't be silly.
So Scott's your roommate, huh?
She's off. (goes over to the now available public phone)
Of course. Absolute zero!
(resolved) Why not. (determined) If she can't find me, she can't break up with me. And, if we're still goin' out, she has to gooo to the ballll.
Twenty years? That long?
Ah, not yet.
I confused it with another awning.
(Modestly) Forget it.
I've been standing here for the last ten minutes!
No, not a loser!
Doesn't she have collision?
Because he made a big deal about how I understand everything immediately. That's what impressed him.
No no, this is a matter of principle. That would just be saying that anybody could just pull into any parking space any way they want. Well I'm making a stand here. I'm saying *no* to head first parking. I'm not putting up with that. We put up with too much crap in this city, we're not putting up with head first parking.
It's exciting, isn't it? She's gonna have a whole new face.
How could you do that?!
I dont know where the nurse is. Sweetheart why dont you get a nurse for mommy?  Anyway I was just curious. Remember the other day you were saying something about my trip.
Are you sure?
You know, my mother used to walk around on our apartment just in her bra and panties. She didn't look anything like you, she was really disgusting, really bad body. If you could imagine uglier and fatter version of Shirley Booth. Remember Shirley Booth from Hazel. Really embarrassing, cause you know I had only mother in the whole neighborhood who was worse looking than Hazel. Imagine the taunts I would hear.
(on phone  calling secretary) Hello Margery, George Costanza. How are you sweet heart? Listen, can you give Mr. Thomassoulo a message for me? Yes. If he needs me, tell him (screams) IM IN MY OFFICE! Thanks.
Hey, I am not here for rage. I'm here for revenge.
Hmm. What about a hole? You ever put anybody in "the box"?
(shouts) Awright already!! This is a very key issue with me, Jerry. I had this name for a long time.
I mean, now she thinks that I'm one of these guys that love her. Nobody wants to be with somebody that loves them.
Well, if she keeps horsing around with that tractor--
Oh, there's a soup stand, Kramer's been going there.
I don't know.
Yeah. Hey, wait a second, you know, good news for you too. Susan's best friend, Hallie? Broke up with her boyfriend.
Ha Ho! (he turns and walks out the door)
(to Jerry) He collects them.
Oh I got it. (TO JERRY) That I'm supposed to remember. Where the car is, that's insignificant.
(horrified) But that meeting starts in ten minutes!
Um, all right, um, uh, I'll call 'ya. I'll call you and we'll talk on the phone. A telephone communiqu. Every thing is fine ok, uh, fine, .. [exits]
If we decide to go at it.
Nothing, I... said it was a little problem.
I have no choice, I'm quitting.
I'm gonna get some more of these kosher cocktail franks.. (leaves)
Shhh What is wrong with you? You never tell 'em you like the car. (Advising) You're not sure what you want. You don't even know why you're here.
Yep, and the photo was all fixed and back on his desk, no thanks to you.
I'll tell you what, why don't you read this book and let's just see if you can explain it to me.
Uh, excuse me, are you Joe Temple?
(con't) A-Anyway, I was thinking we would take two cars up to the cabin and that way if one of wanted to stay you know...
Wait a minute, wait a minute, do you think I?m comfortable here. I can't change, I?ve got no clothes here! You've got to go like that, I can?t go like this alone!
Well, that's.. Elaine!
Well, I was exaggerating a bit, just for effect.
(surprise) What? I..I didn't hear about that.
(laughing) You think you're going to the other side with "Hi"? You're not going to make it.
Just give it a little more time.
See, look at this. (wearing a very tight shirt) Rachel, my T-shirt shrunk. It used to be much bigger, and now it shrunk. You see, that's what water does. It shrinks things.
Hey, what goes on there, exactly?
What? Why?
I can't take it anymore! I'm going to work! ARe you happy now?! (Gathers his things, and runs out of the coffee shop. Elaine and Jerry laugh hysterically)
He didnt do anything, Jerry. Its a scam! Who told you to do that?
I don't know. This sandwich is making me flush.
(to Jimmy) Wh...Where d'you get'em?"
All right. I am happy, and I'll tell ya why -- because the two of you were making me and every one of your friends sick! Right, Elaine?
I'm a college graduate. You want me to be a mailman?
You never should have taken away his keys!
Hey, hey. Kramer, what are you doing? You can't smoke in here.
Well, I gotta go back there and try again. Hi Sheila.
(motioning Jerry to follow) C'mon.
Good, good day. How was your day?
Who are you to decide?
Yes, I like to just be able to take the blankets and swish them and swirl them, you know what I mean? You know, I don't like being all tucked in. I like to have a lot of room, you know I like to have my toes pointed up in the air. Just like to scrunch up the blankets.
(cont'd) she says, We have to talk.
My whole life has been a complete waste of time, (chuckle)
" That guy was amazing, he could dunk and he was my height...What was his name again?"
They are?
(not happy delivering Elaine's lie) Well, he uh, he wants to uh, quit the exporting and uh, focus just on the importing. And it's a problem, because she thinks the exporting is as important as the importing.
Oh, sure. I mean, after all, you were almost my, uh... OK, I gotta go.
Conrad, is it?
Ya-hah.
Yeah, hold on. I'm, uh, I'm just trying to get a reading on my dashboard compass. Where are my parents?
Hm. Thanks.
I know. I cut the button off and poked a hole with a letter opener.
(to Elaine) He asked you to get the mail?
Ridiculous!
This is very exciting! You're on the Tonight Show, NBC, who else is on the show?
(pause) Uh-oh.
Uh why don't you wait then go in the movies?
Okay.
Seriously, have they though about changing the setting?
You see what just happened here?
No. Youd be surprised. You dont recover that quickly from a nose job.
Jerry, I felt like a straight man in some horrible sketch. He was riffing! Riffing! On my pain!
I just thought of a great name for myself, if I ever become a porno actor.
Well, who is she?
What, you mean you know about this?
What ever they had. Miranda thinks I'm a butcher but i-i-it's not my fault is it? Don't we have a deal with the pigeons?
(broken, shouts) Gary Fogel never had cancer!
You think the person you were talking to is him? That's not even close to him. He's funny, Jerry's funny.
How much?
No, not at all...
Give me the phone. (dials) Yea, Hi I would like to speak to Patrice. ... what? ... oh really? ... oh, ok, thank you, ... (hangs up)
(sensing his chance) Well, they do now. Neighborhood's changing.
And God didn't kill me.
So?
I know. And now they want me to bottle it up. It makes me so mad!
Really!
(Reflecting on his life gone wrong) This McKigney guy had a few good years.. (To Kramer, bitter) How could you forget to turn off an iron?
I'm really serious. I think that's a good idea.
And you threw it out the window?
No. Thanks, dad.
They were drinking champaign in a buggy!
(The damage has been done. He is slightly angered at Jerry) May I ask, what do you read in the bathroom?
(to Jerry) You watch the old videos. (insistent) I'm telling you, look at him.
I don't know, I just can't. Nobody in my family can pay for parking, it's a sickness. My father never paid for parking; my mother, my brother, nobody. We can't do it.
No! Jerry!
Everything goes with naked.
(looks back to the group) I can read lips. You said let's sleep together.
Who's Killer Kowalski?
Champagne?
The prop comic? (Ronnie holds up his water gun and smiles.) Oh, hi...I didn't recognize you, what...did you get a haircut?
'Kay. I'll uh, I'll see you later. Anybody want some tomatoes?
I've been to the movies.
Maybe I won't send her that check.
B-O-Z-O?
I can't believe it. He's going! He's fired!
(angrily)"WHY WEREN'T YOU MORE CAREFUL WITH YOUR DROOL!"
Yeah, you know we spoke for a little bit...
Never thought I'd fail at failing.
(still looking at that picture) You know if I told my engagement story to that receptionist, but told her this, was my fiance..
Look I need you to do me a favor. I need you to get me lunch at Pisano's.
Oh, Huh, imagine that.
Cut it.
I didnt know there was a fireplace. A fireplace, that's incredible.
All right! We're here!
It's more than the meal!
Tightness..
So, what do you think?
No no no, he's not getting away with this.
Uh, excuse me. (stopping them from rehearsing) Excuse me. (he walks to the guy's in charge of yelling "take #!") This--This is not right. May I? (the guy looks at George with a bothered face. George then walks up to Tom and takes him away from Jerry and Michael to talk to him in private)(to Tom) You see, you're going "They fooled *me* Jerry!" (George shakes his head with disapproval) You wanna hit 'fooled' more "They *fooled* me Jerry!". You see the difference?
I wanna get it back when we were the Gatsbys.
Well, this is a lovely apartment. Lovely! My kids are gonna go crazy. I, uh, I wonder if I could see the bathrooms. Preferably one with some paint thinner and, uh, some rags?
Olive?
So, I'm gonna steal another one, and then return it. That way, everything is even.
Oh, I'm goin' baby. I'm goin.' (Heads for the door, then stops.) It's Jerry's fault. He took out all my good lines. He's such a control freak!
Exactly..
I'm grotesque . I look like a troll.
That doesn't explain the lipstick on the dashboard?
Newman!!
Boy, it stings.
(To the store owner) Excuse me, what do you think of these?
Right now? "Jerry"?
George is going to the movies! (exits)
(to the saleswoman) You know honey for an unadvertised sale, you're doing a lot of yapping about it.
The guy never came back.
Oh ya, like there's something wrong with saying 'God bless you'. I was raised to say 'God bless you'.
And get a picture of him, with his shirt off.
What?
No, no, no, no.
Never happened.
Well, didn't he regift the label maker?
People are looking for tickets here?
Look, you don't understand. There was shrinkage.
No, there'll be girls there.
(to the waitress bringing his doughnut) And a slice of devil's food cake.
Need to use the phone.
'Why don't I rent the movie.' See, this is when I like you. Alright, now I'm relieved. (Kramer enters and comes over to the booth.)
You have my spare-key in your apartment, right?
This is a real piece of junk. I don't even feel safe on this thing. I have a good mind to write a letter toMr. Kimbrough.
Yesterday, took the day off. (Picks up a red Power Ranger action figure from the model and pretends it's him.) Now, from the time I left the room...
I dont know, what were doin here, this is ridiculous.
All right. (smiles behind her back)
Fabulous, I'll think about that George, thank you!
I guess you two are the lucky ones.
Oh my God, I forgot to tell you. I got a letter today from the State Controller's Office. Y'know when I was going to public school back in Brooklyn, every week I used to put fifty cents in the Lincoln Savings Bank.
I gotta find a way to work this out, I love that apartment. It's so cozy, I'm ensconced in velvet. You know, if it were socially acceptable--
Jerry! Stop it!
I had the perfect situation here, he was shouldering half the load.
I can do this, Jerry.
Parole! (Feigning joy) That's dynamite!
It just didnt work out. What can I do? I wanted to love her. I tried to love her. I couldnt.
Nothing.
No, I don't have any change. I never carry change.
Huh. You must think Im pretty stupid. (The mechanic shoots him a look as if he cleary does think hes stupid) That was no 5th Avenue bar. I can see the crumb right there in the corner of your lip! Now, that-that-that is a cookie - and we all know that Twix is the only candy bar with the cookie crunch.
(Pointing to them) Office Christmas gift. I tell you, this Human Fund is a gold mine!
Well, it was very nice meeting you Shelly and Jerry be careful, there's a lot of nuts out there. (to Paula) All right you have everything?
(hesitates) Very close, yes. Almost painfully close.
Is that tolerable?
You gonna sleep on the fold-out?
(leaving) That'll do.
You see. You see! Listen when is your next drawing class?
All right. All right! I'll go.
Bust of Nelson Rockefeller.
I tell you, I really don't think so-called relationship humor is what this show is all about.
Married , What!(astounded)
You wanted to see me, El Presidente?
Yes, Mr. Hayman
Elaine! (shouts) ELAINE!!
Defective?!
Prognosis Negative! (again in a funny voice)
Nice to meet you.
Jean-Paul?
Oh no no no no, don't say anything to Kramer. Susan can't stand him. He vomited all over her.
This is nighmare. Kramer how long was I on?
Wo-hoah! What did you do?
I cant believe I won at Inka-dink.
I saw Siena again.
Tell me your impressions, I would love to hear what a young woman thinks of "The Big Game".
You know, uh, she has no female friends! You know that, don't cha? Something strange about a woman whos friends are all men.
You know, I think we really need to be in front of a television set. You take T.V. out of this relationship, it is *just* torture.
All right. All right. Let's - let's go over that again.
You told David Putty your move and you didn't tell *me*? I *need* a move. You know I have no moves, Jerry. (points to the candy bar) Gimme a bite.
Playground equipment.
All right, look--wait--wait--Krama--wait, wait a minute, you are not. You are not goin' in. Ah-ahhh!
Oh please.
Hey!
Yeah. Hey! Hey!
How could you be a doctor and not say "get outta here"? It should be part of the training at medical school "Cancer? Get outta here!" "Go home! What are you crazy? It's a little test. It's nothing. You're a real nut. You know that?" (Jerry gives him half of his sandwich to hopefully shut him up) I told you that God would never let me be successful. I never should've written that pilot. Now the show will be a big hit, we'll make millions of dollars, and I'll be dead. Dead Jerry. Because of this. (showing his lip)
If it makes you happy, I don't focus on these things. I will tell you this Unfortunately, we live in a very superficial society. I don't condone it, but it's a fact of life.
Nobody drives like me. Nobody. I'm doing things in this car, you have no idea they're going on. Wanna see me make a right turn from the left lane? Watch this.
Well, that was bound to happen.
(in his mind) I think that ginger ale at the coffee shop is just Coke and Sprite mixed together. How can I prove it? Ah! Can't, dammit. (knock at door. George goes to open it)
...and the Jews steal our money through their Zionist occupied government and use the black man to bring drugs into our oppressed white minority communities.
Not necessarily. Mustard lends itself to the squeeze.
Well, it's all over. I slipped up.
That's the question, Jimmy.
Oh, no, no, no...you sit right here...I will get you a nice snack.
I guess so.
Hey, by the way, what'd you think of Miss Yoshimura?
And you don't have to pay.
I'm George.. George Costanza.. I've never been in the hospital a day in my life.. except when I had my tonsils out. You know, they never gave me any ice cream. I always felt that-
Uh-huh. And how much does the healer charge?
Ya.
Yo.
Oh, can you be any more dramatic?
We'd have to kill him.
Loves bald? (laughs) Wow. Who uh, who is she?
Me neither.
Yeah, well, he probably bought it.
Huh, really? How bad? Was he on his death bed?
Absolutely. Because instead of doing a wash, I just keep buying underwear. My goal is to have over three hundred and sixty pair. That way, I only have to do wash once a year.
No, I, uh, um, wa, wa, What did I do? ... Where are you going?
You mean like a bra?
Pardon me, I went to see your friend Dwayne... there was no discount.
Come here.
Look at that. They got lobster on the menu. Who would order a lobster here. I mean, do they bring a lobster in everyday hoping *todays* the day.
Yeah, it's being framed right now. I don't even know what it costs. (beat) Not, uh, too expensive, is it?
Sure you can.
You are my friend.
What the hell are you two talking about? (All exit)
Yes funny (laughs; hand clap) let's go.
I swear.
Yeah, that's exactly what I'm worried about. God would never let me be successful. He'd kill me first. He'd never let me be happy.
No. No
(on tape, singing) "Believe it or not, George, isn't at home, please leave a mes-saaage at the beep. I must be out or I'd pick up the pho-one. Where could I be? Believe it or not, I'm not hooome." (beep)
Nah. It's all right. Great! She had a good time.
Wait a minute, that is my apartment. I earned it with 34 years of misery!
Well,,, it's getting dark.
Absolutely.
(positive) Yes. From endorsing checks for the Super Terrific Happy Hour. (laughs)
I'm good.
How much are we gonna get for this? Fifty, sixty thousand?
So, Im thinking, as shes saying this, Im thinking great, the relationships over. But the egg salads on the way. So now I have a decision Do I walk or do I eat?
He fired me.
Yeah, you know, what'd she uh, look like?
Not yet. Oh! Ho ho! God...
(entering Jerry's bathroom) Well, Hanke's moved on to Step Ten. He was spotted taking personal inventory.
It's, funny runnin' into you here.
Why do you keep saying Nina?
No, no I don't think so.
I froze. I think I'm losing it.
Yeah.
I thought it was a date.
He started it.
Its over.
Bring it on!
The only thing that bothers me is that I'm just coming up with this now.
So, she cant get the apartment.
Fine. Excellent. Could you do me a favor? Could you not tuck the blankets in? 'Cause I can't sleep all tucked in.
Wed all go to movie on Friday?
(incredulous) You can't ground me, I'm a grown man.
You have no idea how refreshing that is.
It was kinda fun. (Elaine gives Jerry a cold cloth for his jaw.) You know, maybe his name really is J-O-H-N, but he changed it to J-O-N for show business. Well, you know, J-O-N is a lot zippier.
I calculated my odds of ever getting together with a Portuguese waitress. Mathematically, I had to do it, Jerry.
Where are all the poetry magazines?
Where are you meeting these women? When they get off the bus at the port authority?
But, uh, Raymond is a man.
No..hummm, What do you know about what you look like.
Fire! Get out of the way!
Lloyd Braun? What d'you have to meet him for?
No, don't say a word. If she thinks my friends are jerks, then I'm a *jerk*...
(pointing outside) Why is there a Cadillac parked in front of the house?
Really? You like it? I got it at a flea market today.
Pretty chintzy, huh? Considering the money she makes.. She's a big executive for Federal Express.
Yeah so??
Im outta there. I did it! Its over.
What did she say?
He's the guy we're the buying the chair for, remember? It was your suggestion.
That's right! He never apologized to me for saying that I would stretch out the neck hole of his sweater.
He's a great writer.
I been, uh, thinking about the family. Tell me, uh, about Aunt Baby.
A pig-man?
Of course it's cashemere.
Maybe.
I like to stop at the duty free shop!
Food was good.
I, uh, just think it's a little unusual. Two people to sit on one side...and leave the other side empty.
No, no,
What, it didn't bother her?
(George takes out the suit from the other rack) Well, look at this. (innocently) This doesn't belong here! Someone has made a terrible mistake.
Who am I going to tell? My mother? Like I've got nothing better to talk about.
Behind the dugout, that's where we were sitting the other day.
[realizing the only way out is to show the stub] I've got the stub.
I don't have a spare set. All my keys say 'do not duplicate'.
Of course, right.
How as the date?
Ok, it's a deal!
Are you gonna move the car?
Okay. (Chewing) Thanks anyway. (Continues to chew as he exits)
Come on, Kramer.
This pasta primavera is fabulous.
Good....good day (not too convincing) You?
Listen, you're lucking I'm not asking for a whole refund. (trying to speak quietly) You gave me ladies' frames!
All right, where do you want it?
Well, that doesn't mean anything!
You can't, it's a textbook.
(Concerned) Why're you doing this, Jerry? Is it your career? Things will pick up.
I understand you offer a 50%-off 'bereavement' fare...?
Well I'm not starting up a whole new wardrobe now!!!
Chinese food?
The uniforms! Did you see how they played? Listen to these comments! (reads from the paper) "Wade Boggs 'What a fabric! Finally we can breathe.' Luis Palonia 'Cotton is king.' Paul O'Neill 'I never dreamed anything could be so soft and fluffy.' "
He mentioned my name?! What did he say?!
Mister Seinfeld? What about Mister Costanza? I'm not here?
What?!
(remorsefully) I can't go.
If only she could get fired. Is there any way that could happen? I mean I know how to get myself fired.
Really? At the tennis match?
Beautiful lineswoman. Alright listen uh I'm going to go to the concession stand and get some real sunblock. You want anything? Jerry? (Jerry is staring at the lineswoman) Jerry?
Well why didn't we?
(Laughs) yeah, burned. Whoo..
(coyly, he looks down and runs his finger along the top of the chair back in front of him) Do you, uh ... do you know what Im ... thinking about now?
Yeah, the neck hole thing, and I would appreciate it if you would say you're sorry.
Oh good, good, come in. Come in, welcome. I'm George. And this is Jerry, over there, on the phone, that's Jerry. And you are, um?
You won't think I'm a bad person?
How did he do that?
No. No. No. No. No. Don't worry. It's perfectly safe. I researched it. He'll get a little woozy. He might keel over.
The doc called and said the lab's backed up and now I'm not gonna get the results for another two days.
I think he's saying 'Son of Sam'! Oh, my God!
(turning to each other) I dont know. Hes an importer.
No... (takes off his glasses and wipes his eyes with his sleeve)
(Once again, still on the shower) Could it be lukewarm?
Hey, Buck. Talk to you for a second?
It says very clearly, 'for your protection, do not give your secret code to anyone.'
I don't like it, it's red. It it's too flashy.
Well, yeah.
You're going that way anyway!
I, I couldnt wait. I was too anxious to see you.
Excuse me, are you the guy with that funny laser?
No! I'm not gonna do that! That's one step away from personal ads! And prostitutes! No! No, I am not going down that road! What does she look like?
Kramer!
You know it must be impossible for a Spanish person to order seltzer and not get salsa. (Angry) "I wanted seltzer, not salsa."
Yeah, I saw it.
So this Anna called me from out of the blue.
. . . . . . Yeah.
(worried) Yeah, that's right. What if it's a genetic thing, like father like son?
Plans. Schemes. She ah, she keeps talking about getting back together with her old friends, you know - "the gang," as she likes to call them (chuckles), you know. Yeah, they're eh, they're hatching something, you can count on that.
Bob Cobb?
What? Did you get the busboy's number?
Hey look, he's back.
You know, my arm feels a lot better. That Wendy really knows her stuff. (he writes out a cheque)
No, I can't. She knows I go there. It's not secure. (the call waiting beeps) Hey, I got another call comin' in. I gotta let the machine get it. Bye. (hangs up)
What, is he crazy?
Yeah. You've heard of it?
Start what?
Today. Im going today. Just dont do anything until you hear from me.
"Off the wagon"?
(Rejecting) Ohh, no. No, no, no..
Because you were being so nice.
Jerry! I did it! Haha! I beat Braun!
Yeah. I'll see you later.
We got a deal.
About a year ago. Wedding invitations.
Hey pop, would you buzz off, I've got something cooking.
. . .uh, . . . wait a second. Are you suggesting that I went out of my way to tell Elaine that even though you handed her the big salad, that it came from me?
He he This guy really gets around.
We have no need to speak. We communicate with deep soulful looks.
Okay, go ahead.
Well, thats flattering.
Well I think I'm better off going one-on-one.
You are a genius, it's as simple as that.
Hey. I've kept the same job for more than two years. It's not luck. Elaine, have you ever sent a racy photograph of yourself to anyone?
Well, I gotta do somethin'. (Walks over to bathroom. Kramer enters)
That's a lot of pressure. Make love to me. What am I, in the circus? What if I can't deliver?
(Getting up, he addresses Jerry) All right, remember no rust-proofing. Commit to nothing. If you have to speak - mumble.
Yeah, yeah. Big advisor.
Hey. Check these out. I just picked them up from Sheila. She must have loved these.
First time in my life I've ever gotten back at someone.
I know.
Clark Bar.
Alright, well you know what'cha gotta do, you gotta go through her purse. Y'know, the-the credit cards, driver's license...
(Irritated) It's called a T-square.
No. I need a guy that can rig a Frogger machine so that I can move it without losing power, 'cause I have the high score. H-hello?
They did?
It's just we want you to go.
Mrs. Sweedler thank you. Y-You see, this tragedy affected me in a very, very personal way.
(relishing) Hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm. Delicious.
I don't know.
Maybe you said something that offended her.
Yes, positive.
How's your life? All right?
Colin O'Brien.
Gee, that's-that's too bad.
Yeah, I want to see if there's anything I can do.. maybe get him another job.. maybe I'll hear of something.
I'd like to sleep with a LOT of other women.
What're.. What're you talking about?
A man gave me...
So?
No, I froze.
HI ELAINE...
Stinks.
I still have it. The collar's okay. I wear it under sweaters.
Jerry gargles? Is that why he takes so long?
You think so?
Woah, back it up, back it up. Beep, beep, beep. Tractor story?
Me?
You know what, I'll just uh, I'll just look around for a little while. (moving to come round the counter) I'll just browse around.
Tsst...'Course I have. Come on. My cousin's in a bubble. My friend Jeffrey's uh, sister, also ... bubble ... you know. I got a lot of bubble experience. Come on.
Wait, wait a second, what are you doing?
You know what I've come to realize? I'm not just bored. I genuinely dislike her.
The Chinese have done it my friend. The Chinese have done it.
An eye job? Ma, you don't need an eye job.
They were, it's kinda complicated.
I gotta call her. Should I call her?
I was naked.
You shook my hand in that coffee shop.
You know, that, that thing about her being too good for him. I mean, I was just bein' folksy. They could tell I was just being folksy..?
Really...(he honks the car and is startled, Elaine laughs)......I have to say...You were really good doing that porno thing....you're talented.
I've gotta go to the bathroom.
He knows I'm waiting. He sees me. He just doesn't wanna look.
Right. I don't have it on me. Allison, this is Susan. Susan, Allison.
I suppose if I had suggested Liam Neeson Day, you'd all be patting me on the back.
Why didn't you say something then?
Oh yeah.. (Starts to open it) Sally called Susan - said you guys really hit it off.
All right, Kramer that's it.....( pushes the camera) Hello . English. Does anyone speak English
(claps all happy) AH! (half hugs Estelle)
I've seen squeeze mustard. I've never seen squeeze ketchup.
Yes! Yes. You know. She didn't know about Pasteurization. He didn't know anout Fumigation. But they made it work!
I-I'm sure if you weren't satisfied you would probably say something wouldn't you?
Don't do it!
That was different!
Yeah. You like it.
We'll come up with something.
I don't know, I like stuff you don't have to think about too much.
I did!
Should I give you my keys, is that the transaction, trading keys...? Because Elaine has my keys.
Yeah.
All right, that's enough. I gotta go home and take a nap.
There was a box of raisins on the coffee table. Did you, by any chance, take them with you when left?
I don't know what you're getting all riled up about. There are probably a million Costanzas-
What are you looking at me like that for?
Hey! (to Elaine, who doesn't look too cheerful)
Im not going with him. I dont even know the guy. (to the teller) Look, they did this for me before.
Right. And, and to cover my nervousness I started eating an apple, because I think if they hear you chewing on the other end of the phone, it makes you sound casual.
Yes, of course I'm taking Allison. This woman is genetically engineered to go to a ball. Tall, blonde, lithe--
I-I don't get these birds! They're breaking the deal. It-it's like the pigeons decided to ignore me!
Ahh, Excuse me, how much is this?
You got a line in the Woody Allen movie?
Because I'm a cheater! I had to tell you.
You are?
Too much salt in my diet.
I'm sorry. I can't live knowing Ted Danson makes that much more than me. Who is he?
Hey, Van B. Boys.
What do you mean not goin'? Come on, we got plans here. Call her up.
(leaving the european accent) No. (laughs)
Boy, these are really bad details.
(Obviously knows that, but pretends he doesn't) What, tonight? Now?
So, was it me?
My parents. It's their anniversary. I'm taking them out to dinner and a show tonight. You think we'll hit traffic?
(disbelief) What?! They're stealing the name?! That's my name, I made it up!
They got a billion people over there and he found a relative.
From the bathroom.
Yes.
Th... this isn't mine.
It's just a magnificent stone. (turns to Jerry) Jerry?
Listen to the comeback. (pleased) 'Oh yeah? Well the jerk store called. They're running outta you.'
Still getting nothing!
Oh, no. No stories.
Well, it's all for charity, so what's the difference.
Yeah, the oceans really are getting very sudsy.
Yeah, yeah.
Hey. It's me.
Uh, yes, actually we-we both do.
I banged it on the desk in the doctor's office. An (worriedly rubbing his arm) aaaa . . .
(Still on the showers) Can I use hot water on my face?
Look, I'm doing you a favor. They're having an unadvertised sale. This suit is gonna be half-priced starting ... Monday.
What about this leftover Chinese food?
Come on, itll be so much easier.
Yes I look forward to many years of... looking at the triangles. Well, I'll ah, I'll wait for you outside.
I snapped! It was the last straw. (sighs)
She told me she wants-- (Pauses until a woman coming down the stairs passes) She told me she wants me to make love to her.
(interrupts her) You know what. I don't think I'm going to be able to stay over tonight.
Yeah.
Oh ho! Class, huh? At Columbia? Let me tell you something, pal. I called the registrars office. I checked you out. They have no record of a Ray Thomas at that school! You liar!
Oh yeah. So wait, wait. A half-hour later Im back in the office, I tell Lloyd the whole story. He says, So why dont you call her? I says, I cant. I couldnt, I couldnt do it right then. For me to ask a woman out I gotta get into a mental state like the karate guys before they break the bricks. So Lloyd calls me a wuss.
(Embarrassed) That's all I could find. (A moment passes) Would you mind getting the door?
What time is it?
Oh, you lying little snot. And he's a cheater. Aren't ya' you little twerp?
(to Jerry) It's all white Jerry! It's all white!
See her tonight. See her tomorrow. Go. Knock yourself out. Shes too crazy for me.
Oh, no. No. No. No. No. Nothing. I'm fine. Everything's fine. Fine. Just get a little nervous on the weekends, that's all. Could I, uh, could I get a glass of water?
(Sarcastic) Yeah, performance artist. She's a real performer. A real trooper.
(Elaine walking down the hall they notice her and wave her into the room) Elaine! Get! (She enters)
It's not working, Jerry. It's just not working. (sits down next to Elaine)
"Jerry"!
And that was wrong, Jerry! You simple must to apologize..
Just a little something for Christmas.
uh-uh. What's with the bucket?
All right. That's enough for today. You're tired. Get some sleep. I'll see you first thing in the morning.
(uncomfortablly) Thank you.
THIS is your daughter? My God! My God! I I hope you don't mind my saying. She is breathtaking.
Y'know there are tribes in Indonesia where if you keep your coat on in somebody's house, the families go to war!
(taking it out of his jacket pocket) yeah I got some sandwiches.. I got tuna.. and salmon salad Tony because I know you don't like peanut butter
I saw "Titanic". So that old woman, she's just a liar, right?
Can he hear us?
Aretha! (points finger at Jerry)
(To himself) Oh my God.
Pack of gum. Here you go. (hands the clerk a $100 bill)
"Yeah,yeah yeah yeah! I've seen these.....they sorta ..they make your legs..stronger."
Well, at least, I'm not carrying a purse.
How hard could it be? You make a little contribution, you have a ceremony. I am going to think about this. I am really going to think about this.
(panicky) What are you gonna do? Are you gonna call the police?
(taken aback) The actress?
Uh, twice what youre payin here, but its a great building. Its two bedrooms!
Why?
What? Oh I spilled some food on it.
All right Superman's the exception.
Be right with you. Look Mr. Steinbrenner.
It's like going to the bathroom in front of a lot of people and not caring.
Yeah.. may - maybe I'll meet ya?
Yeah. I'm Buck Naked.
What about a rec room? Huh? Or a community center.
Oh, well, a mantel's a whole different story.
You're considering hiring me for your latex salesman.
That is what I want.
(shout) Marisa Tomei!
(continuing) I feel like a family. In fact, yesterday was Grace's birthday. She's such a sweet woman so, we had a little party, with cake and champagne. I made a toast.
She's leaving me dirty messages on my answering machine.
You know. You use the, uh...(mutters something unintelligible under his breath.)
Out of the question. Out of the question!
hey nice move today
I'm not going to break a hundred on this thing.
Did I need that pointed out for me? What is that going to do for me? How does that help me, to see her? I'm trying to live my life. Don't show me that.
Well, actually you did miss one nugget of entertainment. (Pause) Have you ever seen Elaine dance?
(Muttering out, not really wanting to talk about his family) When the Costanzas came here, one brother stayed behind.
So... uh you feel okay about that whole thing... what we do in there... you're generally okay with everything in there?
20 bucks? Isn't that excessive?
Pouty? I like that.
Hate the Drake.
What, you don't think I can attract beautiful, intelligent women?
So, Marcy, you should've seen me in the hot tub yoday.
It's not that long, really.
Shortness of breath..
If you're bleak, you're bleak.
(frustrated) Fine. Fine. (to customer) Excuse me. (heading for the door) Think I'm gonna forget about this? I haven't forgotten about this. I don't forget that easily!
You're spending the weekend with Ellen?
Do you swear?
Yeah.
For how long?
Every woman on the face of the earth has complete control of my life. And yet, I want them all.. is that irony?
(jokingly) Well, so, legally, I could marry your daughter.
You think Kramer'll do it?
So, check out my view.
He wants to talk about "Jerry"?
You saw who, what?
Drakes?
What the hell.
. . . I'm a little scared of her.
Well I don't think she is a multiple sneezer, because she sneezed again later, and it was also a single.
No! No!
(yelling) Awright, let's just stay calm here! Don't get all crazy on me!
I don't know, she lives right around the corner. You could take it here or go to the coffee shop.
Really good?
What are they saying now?
(gestures towards book) But I proved it!
Grass
What kind of hair?
It's good. Believe me.
Hey Deena, come on, give us a hug. (they hug) Oh my gosh, you look as pretty as you did back in high school.
What?
I don't know.
A-ha.
Jiffy Park. It's incredible.. Seventy-five dollars a month.
Well...I was in the locker room showering, and I...I had to go, so...
Huh. Your renting a house in Tuscany?
[to himself] Argh! [to Susan] Susan! Hi! Oh, boy! What are you doing here?!
No difference. I could care less. She's Jerry's girlfriend.
Ah! There's mom, there's mom.
I was doing standup comedy in Kennebunkport Maine. ??? night club. The stage was on a cliff and the audience was throwing all the comics off.
So, where you gonna stick this (points to the Fusilli Jerry)
Really? I thought you and Celia were sleeping together?
(angry) Well, that's the name!
(impatient) For her. Not for you.
What do you think about a rocking chair?
You know, if I could get this Coco woman down to Kruger, they wouldn't be able to call me Koko anymore because Kruger would never allow 2 Kokos.
Well, so much for purification week.
Still a little summer left.
But...somebody like Gail, though.
Well nothing. I didn't actually say that. (Karen is still laughing)
Well, we'll just see.
(downcast) Yeah, too bad. Too bad.
If only something like that could happen to me.
Reilly is no longer with the club. (getting up) You believe that?
I said 'God bless you'. Was that so wrong?
All right. Shh! I gotta focus. I'm shifting into soup mode.
Okay, uh, look, if you want to just keep on doing the same old thing, then maybe this idea is not for you. I, for one, am not going to compromise my artistic integrity. And I'll tell you something else, this is the show and we're not going to change it. (To Jerry) Right?
Carl... Yeah, he was a nice guy.
I just want the both of you to know how much you mean to me, and I love you both very, very much.
My story?
Where were you?
(checking his watch) Hey, let's get the check, she's taking the bandages off at four o'clock.
Oh, yes. I already packed up my desk, sir. I can be outta here in an hour.
nothing
Oh yeah?
And why shouldn't you? Be fresh Stay fresh
I don't want to walk that far.
Ok, everybody, uh...I have an announcement to make. From now on, I will be known as-
Oh! Here you are. Ha ha...You, uh, you want to--
No. No way.
Well, I'm still here. You took out the other guy!
It's the real deal.
All right, enough! Enough! From now on, no more yada yada's. Just give me the full story.
Del Boca Vista!
Yeah. Really.
Really?
Looks pretty good.
She bought.
Fantastic?
I had a job interview.
(can't be heard but looks like) Kramer!
(Frantic) Kramer, do you know what those guys are gonna do to me?!
All day. ( phone rings , Jerry picks up)
Frolf, frisbee golf Jerry. Golf with a frisbee. This is gonna be my time. Time to taste the fruits and let the juices drip down my chin. I proclaim this The Summer of George!
This is horrible.
I thought you meant the..
I don't believe it, what did you say?
She confused "six" with "sex"?
That won't be necessary.
I'm starving...
You're kidding.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. But then, I said to him, 'Oh yeah? Well, the jerk store called, and they're running outta you.'
How are you closer to him than me?
Mr Wilhelm? Wha..what're you doing here?
Well today's your lucky day.
Oh, thats great. Thats great. By the way I have to apologize for my friend the other day. Friend? Uh, uh I dont even know that woman. I met her on the bus on the way over. I couldnt get rid of her. Uh, My psychic instincts were a little off ..
Judgement, Jerry, judgement! You exercised no judgement.
W--then I'm pretty much where I am now. At least I got to take a ride on a spaceship.
You're incredible.
For that rent, shed take a bath in the toilet tank if she had to.
Wha - what are you doing later?
(animated) Then I'm going to Mars!
Pretend you didn't know it was there. Can you see it?
Please...
Things are good.
(screaming) Aaahh!!
You know, I'm a little nervous.
This line is huge.
He massacred you.
Oh, get outta here.
Hello..
So I saw that new movie about the Hindenburg.
Come on 'Oh George, oh Geeeooorge!' Come on! Not that I don't appreciate the effort that was put into it.
Why can't I stay?
Hey Elaine.
You like that?
Don't you understand? It's not about him. To have a line as perfect as 'jerk store' and to never use it. I, I couldn't live with myself.
I'm afraid I'm just not interested in how I present myself. If those kind of superficialities are important to you, this probably isn't gonna work.
And then you came here.
(nervous) All right now we're going bye bye.
Have you seen the new addition to the Guggenheim?
Do you have your bathing suits?
He's a sports writer for the daily news. I find him very insightful...
(Getting up) Alright, Ma, that's enough!
He dropped it.
You telling me that wine is better than Pepsi? Huh (snort), no way wine is better than Pepsi.
Here ... something.
(Standing up) Yes. This is wrong!
Oh no no no, if you must know, I would rather be with her than go to the game.
(to a street vender selling hot dogs) You must hate hot dogs, huh? Or else, you, uh, you really like 'em and that's why you, you do this.
What does this mean?
Yeah, but nothing happens on the show. You see, it's just like life. You know, you eat, you go shopping, you read.. You eat, you read, You go shopping.
Jerry, I'm not suggesting getting rid of the girl. She's integral.
When did you get this idea?
. . . naw, it's just you thanked HER, and and oh, . . . what's the difference?
I was wrong, you were right.
(Stern, angered) I hope so. (Takes the scissors)
All bald people look good in hats.
Thank you.
Jerry! Hey, that's the guy!
I read somewhere that this Brentano's is the place to meet girls in New York.
You mean alias.
ALL the way, baby!
All right You really want to know?...It all started when she told met hat...she was the voice on your tape recorder.
Yeah, I told her to call me here and to tell anyone who answers the phone to ask for a balding, stocky man with glasses. I better tell him I'm expecting a call.
You mean just walk into the staff meeting on Monday morning like it never happened?
Finished your thought.
All right.
All right, I gotta get going. My parents are expecting me.
You wanna sell computers? I will show *you* how to sell computers! Hello, Mr. Farneman. You wanna buy a computer? No? Why not? All right, I see! Good answer! Thank you! (Lloyd rings his sale bell) Serenity now!
(shouts) Of course there's something wrong! (points at Jerry) We had a pact!
(laughs hysterically, gesticulating wildly) This is all blowing up in my face! My serious girlfriend, and my torrid love affair have accidentally crossed paths. I have ruined three lives... (grabbing coat) Well, I understand if you never want to see me again, so... (points towards door)
Yeah. (George hands over the prescription) Kramer...
Sounds like a rough trip.
Tsss...Yeah..
Woody mentioned me? What did he say?
Well, a lot of people keep popcorn in the house.
Hey.
I..I..I dunno.
So you're on the speed dial?
He's an obscure writer. Betnik, on the village.
Well, how good a look did you get?
What you talking about?
Warning signs?
(takes a bite) Oh, that's good. That's very good.
(distracted) Mm? (acknowledges Katy) Oh, hi. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. We met uh, skiing that time. You're uh, married to the eye guy.
Don't you see? I'm back in.
Ah, well, you know we gotta been running because of the ...
Seven forty-five.
Oh boy.
Hey, by the way, if anybody wants an inside tour of the zoo, Siena works there as a trainer.
I can do six weeks standin' on my head. I'm a sexual camel. That's not the point. At least there was the possibility.
Yes, well you see, the deceased landed on my car. The uh splat, as it were, actually occurred on the roof of my car. Now of course I can't help but feel that had it been a convertible this whole tragedy might have been averted but I've never been the kind of guy to buy a convertible, what with the baldness and everything.
Uh, Jerry, you want your blankets tucked in?
For my hamstring.
Well whad you buy it for?
It was very traumatic. The last thing I remember is you flinching. Then, everything went black.
No, no...I hate the condom.
It's all departures. I see nothing but departures. (to the woman beside him) Do you know where the arrivals are?
No! I don't! Don't you even care? This is your company! It's your name on the outside of the building! Speaking of which, the 'R' fell off and all it says now is K-uger!
You'll do it?
Really? Coco?
Yes.
Cut it.
Well, I'm sorry!
"George is getting upset.."
(opening door to leave) He picked her up?
(pauses to consider this then gives in) All right. (starts heading towards bedroom)
All right. I will see you boys later.
. . . I thought the woman was kind of cute.
How so? I'll tell you how so. She's bald!
(Yelling out, frustrated. The camera spins from a top angle) Twwwwiiiiiixxxxx!
Who told you to sell the card?
Anyway, as I was lying in the puddle, I-I think I may have found a way for us to get Bonds and Griffey, and we wouldn't have to give up that much.
Yes and I was hoping ... to get a thirteen week extension.
Wha-Is that the one your parents gave you?
No, not really.
I find the soothing pastorial images very conduc-
Guess, what I got.
Wow.
The truth. you want the truth? It is your earrings It is the chopsticks but it's so much more. You're pretentious. You call everyone by their full name You call my doorman, Sammy, "Samuel" but you didn't even say "Samuel" You went "Sam - U- EL" Papie-eh Mach-eh What is Papie-ay Mach-ay?
I don't know.
I'll pay you for your time....I just ..I just need some information . How much do you want? ten....fifteen? You have change for twenty?
(frustrated) No. No, no, no. You're not helping me.
Any more grape juice? (Gets up and goes to the kitchen. Remy moves to the end of the couch where George was sitting.)
So how long did you live there?
Kramer, don't be fooling around up here.
He's got a gun! He's got a gun! Get out of the way! (Tries to flee the bar in a mad panic. The audience in the club also goes nuts and heads for the exits. Jerry stands onstage, perplexed.)
Yes, hello. Party's over. (taking off the suit)
What's that?
No, the cushion's turned over.
If my parents had a mantel, I might be a completely different person.
Whats seventy-five bucks?! What, am I seeing Sinatra in there?! Am I being entertained? I dont understand this. Im only paying half.
Alright, Lupe, bye-bye now.
Hey! Wow, the K-Man! (They walk into the kitchen inside)
(stops Jerry realizing something) Hey hey hey hey hey hey.
I don't understand. Paper Machay hats?
Just enjoying watching you.
(Heavily sarcastic. He's angered at Jerry) Good one. Very funny. You're very funny, Jerry. That's what I always tell people. (Yelling out) Jerry Seinfeld's a funny guy!
So I finally stop and say, "Tatiana, I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but I think it would be best if I left".
Mom and Pop Seinfeld
No!
Bar?
That's because it's underwater.
Squirrel? Well, we have no deal with THEM!
Hey, use mine. Ill let you in.
So, she was switching? Back and forth?
Well if she can't tell "six" from "sex" then how is she going to lip read from across the room?
All right. All right. Let's not get into panic mode! Let's not make a big deal outta this thing or we're never gonna get through this night.
Ohh, I have tremendous respect for people who work with feet. I mean, to dedicate yourself to the foot - you're toiling in virtual anonymity. I mean..
Yes, I heard you!
No. Semi-daily. Four or five times a week.
Besides, Steven Koren has the highest of aspirations. He wants to be (pauses for effect) an architect.
Ma, will you stop?... Its just a statue!... How is it my fault?!... It was stolen. I didnt even touch it this time... Okay, fine... I dont see why this should affect to potatoes!... Okay... Goodbye. (George hangs up.) She doesnt react to disappointment very well. Unlike me.
Oh, very gracious.
Oh, that's nice.
That's right...We just had sex......You know Jerry I've been searching for someone a long time. Well the search is over.
(clears his throat) Im, uh, Im an architect.
Look, Deena, I know you think I'm crazy, but I'm not. This is just a series of bad coincidences.
(Snaps, then points to the coffee table) Hand me an Emory board.
I think.
(to Kramer) You got a job?
The dentist thing?
Told you.
George Costanza, assistant to the traveling secretary.
Years. When we were kids, they made it seem like it was right around the corner.
Well so what's the problem, you just put some newspaper down.
I...I...write a letter and then I..I go to China. I disappear in a sea of people for like six months, a year you know just while things simmer down. Ehm.. Ehm...Dear Susan. I'm sorry. I made a terrible mistake. I'm really , really sorry.
Really?
You know, about how when you break it down, it's really a very positive thing. you know, you have a nure, with a ma in front of it. MA-NURE. Iz not bad.
Why does he have to stand?
Monica wants me to wear it.
Oh, well, so what? Laughter - what is that? I mean, what is the point of opening your mouth and going "Ha, ha!"? What is that? "Ha, ha!"?
Ah, and I got a date with the sales woman. She's got a little Marisa Tomei thing going on.
I think it's neat. You don't hear that much about god anymore.
Poor kid.
I'm still watching them.
Really?
He left... huh... Carl, you hungry?
Sid, it's completely his fault.
Ye - yeah. And we had a pact, you know.
You didn't make it clear.
(visibly disturbed) I...I..I dunno.
Yes, well, if you had never taken your keys back from Kramer, he never would have taken his back from you and given 'em to me, in which case I wouldn't have had to take mine back from her.
You don't speak *any* English?
Robin, listen to me. The most amazing thing has happened. Kramer has opened my eyes. I think I've changed.
What do you tip a chamber maid.
In this scene my co-star who's right over here ( goes over to George who is still on the phone) Follow meeeee... is George Costanza, he plays an airline pilot who's just returned from Rome and I'm about to show him how much I've missed him.
Hey, Mr. Morgan how was your massage?
You know Keith, what I've always wondered, with all these ball clubs flying around all season don't you think there would be a plane crash? ...
This is what I'm talking about.
Yeah, yeah. She's seeing this guy, Art Vandelay.
(Putting his jacket on) I'd like to apologize. I want to tell him I.. I.. didn't mean to get him in trouble.
What's her name?
I believe you cut me off, and then made an obscene gesture.
Well, I could be a little sweetie tweetie weetie weetie.
Hey, a shoe buffing machine!
I'm Colin O'Brien.
I had to listen to a five minute discussion on which one is actually called shmoopy.
Don't leave (George slams the door)
So what's in it for the mentor?
Murphy Brown, the TV show.
Not everybody knows what the crop circles are. (to the newsstand owner) Do you know what the crop circles are?
Uh, excuse me. Uh, pound of Arabian mocha java, please.
She asked me to.
Hey, starving! (Grabs the box from Jerry)
Hu humm? i suppose we could go to Lincoln Center and I'd be wearing sneakers and jeans and that would be fine too.
Okay.
Nope, no can do.
Hi. Look at how obtrusive this is.
No, I don't know. How do I know the usual?
Beef-A-Reeno? You fed the horse Beef-A-Reeno?!
Because I... I love you.
You see I disagree. I'd rather be dating the blind. You know you could let the house go. You could let yourself go. A good looking blind woman doesn't even know you're not good enough for her.
But suddenly, a new contender has emerged...
Thank you.
What? No dibs! I need this statue. Cmon, give it!
Could there be a native p0roblem in the Caymans? Maybe theres native unrest.
One little bite.
Was she mad?
Because... you know...
What are you doing? You're making more than I am. A secretary cannot make more than her boss.
You're cutting me off? No, no, no Jerry, don't cut me off!
I got to give the players most of the credit for that.
You saw him. He was fiddling with the engine. God knows what he did there.
That's your boyfriend.
Well, you know, book reports. That kind of stuff.
No Doctor--
What about me?
Who's that?
I have never seen a Mohel like that.
Because before you know it he'll be having lunch with him. You know how these interoffice politics work.
Aw, Mr. Kruger, Sir. Merry Christmas! (Hands him a card)
Can she talk?
Jay Crespi, how am I gonna forget Jay Crespi?
Why are two pretending to be laughing?
Hey, check this out. I gotta give out Christmas presents to everyone down at Kruger, so I'm pulling a Whatley. (Give a Christmas card to Jerry)
Oh, its a great place, its uh two-bedroom uh, west 83rd bout half block from the park.
The show is about nothing.
Hey.
Apparently the glue in the wedding invitations was a....toxic.
Well, Dr, Allenwood, uh...I was hoping to compile an - admittedly, rudimentary - scrapbook of her life. Something that Betsy could have, and hold onto.
All right, Puddy, listen, and listen good I need to know the name of that mechanic that walks around here. Big guy, a liar. Short name. Sam? Moe? Sol?!
Alright, I gotta go home and open up with the house for the carpet cleaners. You know they're doing my whole place for twenty-five dollars.
What, you think I'm going to repeat the whole thing now?
So, were talking, and I dont like to go too long before I ask them out, I wanna get it over with right away, so I just blurt out, What are you doing Saturday night?
Sounds like a scam. (takes a bite from the granola bar)
Donna. Oh, youre the one that likes that commercial!
Yeah I guess. What can I do? I gotta take her with me. Todd introduced us, I'm obligated.
Jerry took the flyers off the car, I got the whole thing covered.
Oh man.
They wish. I hate the big broker-houses. Hate them with a passion. Big broker-houses killed my father.
Me??
No.
Please. (sits again)
$3.49? It says $1.49.
You gotta look at this. I pulled it in perfectly equidistant from the car in front of me and the car behind me.
Without thousands of fleeing Japanese.
Ah, I've had everything on the menu. Uh, surprise me.
Yeah, you're right, you're right. (To Elaine) Alright, maybe he's not interested, but you still know him - can't you just ask him?
(ready to leave) Well, thank you.
Oh - comfort, schmomfort. Listen, Father, can I ask you a question? In a terrible time like this...who would I get the death certificate from?
Aw, come on. I wanna go see him.
You cant be serious. This is New York city. There must be eleven million decent hotel rooms! Whatta you need? A flag? (waving his handkerchief) This is the signal, Jerry, this is the signal!
These are the balloons? Big deal, all I see is Woody Woodpecker.
I can't believe you're really going out with a woman named Lois.
Yeah, I better grab some too.
(doing the voice) La la la.
No no no no no, this has to be carefully orchestrated. You go to a fancy dinner, flowers...
What happened to you?
I still don't see why you wouldn't eat me. I'm your best friend.
( mouth full) Hi, this is fantastic ( puts the pit in the a plate)D'you ever had a Macanaw peach?
(Outraged. Leaving) Well, you just lost a lot of business! Because I love to read!
Uh, my speech?
No, no, no, see you're not really listening.
Excuse me?
She thinks I'm a nice guy. Women always think I'm nice, but women don'tnice.
I dunno, I'm in a limo. (dials) Hello ma? It's me. Guess where I am. In the back of a limo. No, nobody died. It's a long story, I can't tell you now. Because I can't. I said I can't. If I could, I would. Would you stop it? Alright, look, I'm getting off. No, I'm not telling you! How's this? I'm *never* telling you! I don't care! No! Fine! Never!!
Yeah, Susan tell him.
(bored to death) Well, I-I just recently uh...
Right, ready?
Oh, come on! You gotta get me over there!
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. All right. I don't think we're gonna have any problem with that. (chuckles nervously) Good talking to you Tom. Really.
Hey, look, Kramer,
Oh, *please*! Me? C'mon! That's *great*! Are you kidding? I think thats fan*tastic*! I've always encouraged experimentation! I'm the first guy in the pool! Who do you think you're talking to?
It's Moops.
So are they coming tonight or not?
How'd she find it?
Yeah, yeah. You really cashed in on that favor pretty quick.
It's a spanish dish. It's a moulage of fish, an meat with rice. Very tasty.
Zing.
(Takes two oven mitts from his back pack) Alright, (puts them on) I gotta get going.
Ovaltine. Have you ever had this stuff? Why is it called Ovaltine?
Peggy! (they all sit) His daughter Peggy. Peggy's coming over to serve.
Yeah-hah!
I think that's a good sign.
Who was flirting with you?
Hamstring.
I'm trying to buy some of the clothes back. (realizing something) Hey you wanna come over for dinner tonight? My mother made all this extra Paella.
Good. Now get out.
Nothing really, you know...just eh, stroll around the cell blocks, maybe eh, take in a shower fight. (chuckles.) Hey eh, you know you got a bounced check hanging up in the little market over on Columbus?
God, you're like a rock star.
(to the guy next to him) This guy stinks. (speaking of Michael)
(admitting) All right..
No, no, no. Out of the question. I was over there today. He's got the good spot in front of the good building in the good neighbourhood. I know he's not gonna wanna move.
(worked up) I'm aware! I'm aware!! But this is Marisa Tomei, Elaine. An Oscar winner! How can I live the rest of my life, knowing I coulda been with Marisa Tomei? She said I was just her type! She loves short, stocky, balding funny men!
Hi Connie, Jerry around?
She's still doing that?
(angrily) Oh you mother...
This is not a Metallica concert, it?s an opera alright, a little dignity, a little class, just give me my ticket, I will stand over here and sell it.
Yeah, (Smiling) Susan said you'd be excited.
You know Ava's gonna be there.
Its your decision.
Alright, tell her. Go ahead.
Yeah, right.
I am eating my dessert. How do you eat it, with your hands?
Your girlfriend is doin' your laundry?
When you're talking about a movie like "Beaches", moving from the chair to the couch , . . . that's quite a voyage.
What are you comparing yourself to Keith Hernandez. The guys a baseball player Jerry, Baseball!
(urgent) No! Check! (quieter) Please.
Kramer was supposed to tie a knot
The man in the cape--I bet you he is mixed up in this! I don't trust men in capes.
Hes a cube. Anyway, he got married six months ago. He told me ever since hes been wearing a wedding band, women have been coming on to him everywhere he goes.
I heard your whole conversation.
(pleased) Yeah, it is.
Hey.
That's right.
I could have had some ice cream. I think that might have calmed down the nachos.
A decent hotel-room...
It's June.Mark's Michelle is a dog.
What do you mean?
There's a show. That's a show.
Well I am. Couldn't you try to go through some of that stuff I put in your shoebox?
Why didn't she tell us?
Uh, anyway, (Waving bye to everyone) onward and upward.
(Holding up Kramer's book) According to this, it took.. 10 hours. It eased into the water like an old man into a nice warm bath - no offence. (Pause) So, uh, Clarence, how about abandoning this apartment, and letting me shove off in this beauty?
Jody let's do this agian real soon (he tends his arms for a hug but she avoids him)
Because. There was a lot of cake lying around the house. Just sitting there going with all the excess milk from all the experiments [grins]
I'm an architect.
No. Believe me, he's not.
She didn't help him?
Susan! Jerry! Where are you? I know you're there! Answer me!
Feels right. (cheerfully takes another bite)
Would you believe my luck? The first time in my life I have a good answer to the question, "What do you do?" and I have a girlfriend. I mean, you don't need a girlfriend when you can answer that question. That's what you say in order to get girlfriends. Once you can get a girlfriend, you don't want a girlfriend, you just want more girlfriends.
I don't know. (George sits down at the table. Kramer enters.)
Oh, I, uh, I disagree. You've, uh, you've been living in America too long. (indicates the bag of oranges) You've forgotten what it's like to have no oranges.
It's coming Jerry, it's coming.
Where are you living? Are you here? Are you on this planet? It's impossible. It can't be done.
How are we gonna get out of here? They'll kill us!
Oh, it's not mine. It's my mother's.
Oh. Really.
No. During.
Yeah, yeah.
It's dismissive.
Ah... (quietly)
I don't know. She..She's having some problems with this guy she's seeing.
Now?! I'm a mutant!
I'm sorry! I'm terribly sorry! I- I-
I'll be O'Brien.
No?
(to himself) A cane. I knew it. (to Neil) So, we meet at last. I admire your skills, Mr Peanut.
Why can't I have a heart attack? I'm allowed.
Till I'm comfortable.
I'm a bad man!
Say? What? Nothing, I...
Oh, the guy's got some perspective there.
Excuse me.
Yes but then everything is all pulled down and it's jus.. Anyway. The damage, unfortunately, has marred an otherwise fine automobile, rendering it virtually undriveable.
Oh...pretty good.
U-ok. (George closes the window and shoos Elaine off. He opens the door to Monica.) Here you go.
You're with a *woman*!
(agitated) He's lying, sir! I'm tired of all your macho head games!
You yearn.
(bemused) Really?
[to himself] Hey, whatd'ya know? Look at that! A *lesbian* sighting. Oh-ho! My lucky day. They're *so* fascinating. Why is that? Because they don't want us. You gotta respect that...
Wha..wait a minute, wha..what about Reilly?
(scream) Jerry!!
You see? Now that is a handsome man. (Elaine and Jerry look right at George) Oh please.
Hey, Al. How's it going?
Well what would I say in the note?
Because filth is good. Whaddaya think, rock stars have sponges and ammonia lyin around the bathroom? They, have a woman comin over, Ive gotta tidy up? Yeah right, in these matters you never do what your instincts tell you. Always, ALWAYS do the opposite.
I made a mistake.
Listen I was talking to Elaine today and she said she'd would really like to be an usher at the wedding
It was Moops.
Oh, I sure hope so.
Oh, right, right, the intervention. Should we leave?
Nothing. Uh, I don't know. I gotta go.
Oh no, I can't do it. I-I'm not good at these things, I get flustered. Once I tried to bribe an usher at the roller derby, I almost got arrested.
uh Tony? there's not gonna be too many sandwiches
It's like Im thinking of something, and you're (snaps fingers) one step ahead of me.
Hi, how are you?
I don't think so.
Jerry, I gotta talk to you.
If I didnt put that floss in my pocket, Id be crawling around her bedroom right now looking for my glasses.
(standing) Not yet, but she's weakening.
Oh, no. No no no no.
They say this guy's the best.
Hi, how are ya? (They kiss)
Exactly, but theyre on there  waiting. She said she cant wait to see me, were having dinner tonight. Shes supposed to call me as soon as she gets home.
(seeing his parents being intimate) Oh, my god!
They'll call back.
I got a date with Karen. I don't know what I'm gonna do. Nothing happening down there.
Well how could you just play your message in front of anybody?
(not believing him) You what?!
What kind of a therapist are you? I'm telling I'm scared that something terrible is gonna happen to me, right away you start looking for tumors?
I don't have a flush.
Specific, Ah, lets see. I've walked in and out of so many buildings they all .. blend in together, I uh, ..
Oh, thanks, Bobby. (To Celia) Well, I guess I'll see you in four days.
Hey, hey, hey! It's not Lupe's fault, you shouldn't have left it out.
Yes sir!
You know, I cant believe youre bringin in an extra bed for woman that wants to sleep with you. Why dont you bring in an extra guy too?
No! Theres no coconut!
I didn't have make-up sex.
Those are my friends I was telling you about. We're gonna talk to them, pull over.
(innocent) What?
Oh, the nose job. I don't know, what did you think?
Not that much. You know, they tend to shrink in the water.
sweetheart, no come here,  sweetheart
I like DeSoto.
Well if you didn't think I was parking, why did you put it in head first?
Ma, guess what!
Of course you will. (quick chuckle). You're the best. (with a light fist motion across her chin)
Yeah, I may move out there. (getting 'yeah, right' glances from the Rosses) I mean it, I'll do it! OK, I'll see ya later. Keep it real!
How many days was it between encounters.
How could you do that?
Nevertheless. His time has come.
[whispering] Elaine? [loud whisper] Elaine! [louder whisper] Elaine!
I got up, I was supposed to go to work, I came here instead.
And a guy will appear from out of nowhere. I say "Get out of here! What do you want? You don't belong here!"
Happy Festivus!
(holding a magazine cover) Mira Sorvino. Think she'd go out with me?
Yeah, yeah, like it's just part of the conversation. Oh my boyfriend really likes watches. He's a real watch freak. We-e-ell that's fabulous. (snaps fingers in the air a couple of times)
You know, you know what's great about our relationship?...It's not about looks.
That's perfect! He's a zoo guy! He take's care of animals. C-Can I bring the squirrel by?
...you'll see, things will be different now - if you just give me one more chance.
They way he just says stuff.
Assistant to the General Manager!! Do you know what means?!? He'd could be askin' my advice on trades! Trades, Jerry, I'm a heartbeat away!
Guys, hitting is not about muscle. It's simple physics. Calculate the velocity, v, in relation to the trajectory, t, in which g, gravity, of course remains a constant. (Hits a home run) It's not complicated.
I climbed out the window.
King Edward. (snapping his fingers) King Edward, Jerry.
What about the dolphins? You could swim with the dolphins down there.
You know, you're nuts with these sponges. George is gettin' frustrated!
I can see that.
Ten minutes! Here, here, (Fishes a box of Tic-Tacs out of his coat pocket and tosses them to her) Have some Tic-Tacs.
Carrie, could you do me a favour? Could you not mention this to your mother?
Yeah. You could base a character on me.
I keep wracking my brain to try and figure out what I did. I was smart, I was funny, I made great small talk with the waitress so she could see I could relate to the commoners, you know, I'm a man of the people.
Too flashy?
Stay back! (Runs out of the room, pushing Jerry out ahead of him)
(checking the fridge) No Chinese leftovers. George is gettin' suspicious.
The psychic said something terrible will happen.
You vomited in 1987.
So what's your point?
I can't believe, you're blaming Lupe?
So, you didn't think this was a date?
So uh... Wrath of Khan, huh?
Hey, Lainey, wanna see the horsey?
Uh, excuse me, Wyck. Uh, are we, uh, almost done here?
Because of the day before. It's a long story.
Oh no no no. He's deeply in love, and I was just about to break up with her when she told me.
Yeah, you're just so... hip.
(cheerful) Alright, there you go. She's gonna get the jacket back. (claps hands) So, let's go get some coffee, huh?
Step-skipper. That man is a step-skipper! He skips Step Nine!
Mick Jagger.
Yeah, people who work at NORAD, whore on twenty-four hour missile watch. Everything was going along so great. She was laughing, I was funny... I kept saying to myself, Keep it up, dont blow it, youre doing great.
It - it's just that I'm here with my parents, and my mother wants me to take a civil service test - and to tell you the truth, I don't even think I'd pass it.. So..
Ma, your eyes!
horning on my rock climbing trip. It's just supposed to be me and Tony
So we order lunch, and were talking. Finally, she blurts out how its not working.
Maybe it's got something to do with that 42 in the corner .
Kramer, I really owe you one.
I told her what a sexist he is. How he cheats on his wife.
Hey, hey, how was Florida?
Lingerie?
How come youre not doin the second show tomorrow?
What's the matter with your leg?
Why not. I would be.
Why not?
The sea was angry that day my friends like an old man trying to send back soup in a deli!
Physical therapy is covered by insurance?
How's everything going? Everything O.K.?
You just gave them to him two days ago, he's gotta give you a grace period.
No I didn't!
I can't have an affair with a married woman, that's despicable!
But I have to have them by one o'clock. He's very regiment about his meals.
I'm all for awkward pauses. Fix me up with her.. Wait a minute, Nina just saw me in my Timberlands! Now I have to wear them every time I see her.
Hey, you grew a beard, huh?
Excuse me, where are we?
What're you gonna do now?
(to Jerry) Yeah, your milk.
Your buttocks are spectacular.
That's not the point. The point is I was here first.
Look, I have my system. First I look for the dream spot right in front of the door, then I slowly expand out in concentric circles.
What is Holland?
No, no no it's not about postponing. I just think the first day of Spring is the perfect day to get married. You know, Spring! Rejuvenation! Rebirth! Everything is blooming all the
You know what? I think this Ruthie Cohen gave me the wrong change. Didn't I pay with a twenty? I'm sure I paid with a twenty.
Well, what do they look like?
Heard that one already.
JODI! (he starts running after her)
I got nothing, Jerry. Nothing.
Oh! no no nothing....
Well(coughs) I can't stop now...(coughs) I'm addicted...
yeah
I can't say.
I would give anything to be going up those stairs again.
No, you go Guggenheim. I'm not much of a Guggenheim.
Does Neil like to eat a big breakfast?
Who?
(puzzled) I bought it. (enters lobby)
Well you know in college they used to call me the little bulldog.
That was very real.
Please.
They *left* the Junior Mint *in* him?
Well, some of 'em look good. The ones that look good you don't even know about.
Well, it was a hell of a ride.
Geez.
Right, I got news. You ready? (deep breath) Gary Fogel had cancer.
Alright, now you're gonna see some parallel parking. (spitting into his hands and rubbing them together) How I wish you could make a living parallel parking. (turning around in his seat) It's all geometry, knowing all the angles, when to make that first turn and then when to swing it back in, that's the key.
Why not?
all right! rock-climbing! J..just the 2 of us? alright! hey I'll make some sandwiches, what what do you like? tuna? peanut butter?
Alright, so that's one tuck and one no-tuck.
Yeah.
This is not good. World's are colliding! George is getting upset!
I'm going to a poetry reading with PATRICE First time poets, in a burnt out building, down by the docks, Supposed to be good.
Oh hey, by the way. Do you want a box 'a, Cuban cigars? I smoked one last night. I got nauseous.
That's no tragedy! How many people do you lose on a normal cruse? 30? 40?! Kramer, can I take a look at that book? (Starts walking tward the door. Kramer grabs his food, and follows)
Remember that New Year's party he threw a few years ago? He had that very drafty apartment, you know, I think on Ninth Avenue.
Hup, here we go. Here we go.
Yes, In fact, her mother is in the hospital right now. It's some kind of a Diverticulitis. (he continues walking slowly towards Steinbrenners desk)
So just kick her out.
All right, we'll be a little late, I,m not taking a cab.
Oh my God, I forgot!
How do you suppose they did that?
(angry) She won't sweeten, and I'm bitter!
Yes, for a sales position. Latex salesman, the selling of latex, and latex related products. They just wouldn't give me a chance.
Dad. We need to talk.
Alright. Listen, I gotta get some reading done. You mind if I do this here? I can't concentrate in my apartment.
No, no that's ah, that's pie country.
Let me ask you a question. This new move. Is there a knuckle involved in any way?
Hey, so get this. I get a call this morning from one of the Mets front office guys. They wanna take me out to lunch.
Packyderm?
Good for you.
Right! And these pigeons broke the deal. I will not accept the blame for this!
Yeah.
I dont know. Just start scratching. Tell him you have the crabs. He was in the military. Hell understand that.
This is not good. This is not good.
If you dont say anything I will assume its a plane crash.
I haven't even met the fiancee! Whatever! (Leaves for washroom)
No, no, no, I dont want to carry it around all night. Ill pick it up later.
Elaine, I got to have another picture of Gillian.
I don't know. He can be so weird sometimes.
So what do you do?
Yes. Significant shrinkage.
Well, it's a funny idea.
So?
(claps hands triumphantly) We might have an 'it'!
Oh, yes. Hello.
Na....no ... This relationship he..he..has got to be about something and fast or I'm in very serious and weird trouble....hum What else happened?
Kramer's so stringy. I'm plump, juicy.
Dont you wanna go upstairs first?
Aw, that's a fun age. (Jerry looks at George distastefully.)
Yeah, Well that's a deal where I come from.
What are you, crazy? You were fine.
La-la-la...
So what? Somebody dropped an egg on my head as I went into my building last night.
...neither am I.
It's not real. They're all made up.
And maybe we could go out and do something.
And then I hear this rabbi on television, I mean imagine.
She stole twenty dollars from me. (getting angry) Yeah, I might've gotten it back, but Lloyd Braun interfered!
Fifteen seconds.
Well, Marisa. See, the thing is... I'm sort of engaged.
Yes! Because it is the mature, adult thing to do.
Nose. (chuckles) What's the worst that can happen to a nose? What does it get? Stuffed? (chuckles)
You want my friend to ask his uncle, a man who just lost his wife of 44 years, for a death certificate so that he can save a few bucks on a flight?
Alright, now, how are we gonna monitor this thing?
What's the deal with Aquaman? Could he go on land, or was he just restricted to water?
(Muttering to himself as he walks to the bedroom) More stuff..
You know, I cant believe youre even considering not playing. We need you. Youre hitting everything.
Really?
Hey Rachel!
Come on. Come on.
Care? Forget about care. Love. They have to love the characters. Otherwise, why would they keep tuning in?
No, not Lloyd Braun. But the cashier.
Ah, this is the kind of day that almost makes you feel good to be alive.
. . . Why not?
Come on! No doctor would put that on his car.
(Praising Leo's stealing) Alright, Leo! Stickin' it to the man!
It seems like a problem.
Oh, you do?
Yeah. Thanks. Hey, listen, if you ever get a date, maybe the four of us could go out together sometime.
The rule is a minimum of two days.
Yeah.
Oh, this is great.
No, I won't.
Thanks Roy.
When you sent me the-the bill for the dry-cleaning. I thought the show didn't have a chance.
Why?
Hey, maybe this cheating thing is what I could use to ditch Maura.
Wow
Exactly! You know how they get animals to reproduce in captivity? They just put them in the same cage.
She doesn't.
It's not that easy. It's like "Beat The Clock," there's a lot of pressure there.
How's that Tony?
Who says you gotta have a story? Remember when we were waiting for, for that table in that Chinese restaurant that time? That could be a TV show.
But I'm paying you!
"All right Jimmy Good talking to ya."
Well, Play Now has all kinds of different rubber balls. Why dont we test your bladder system at my office?
(pleased with himself) You are having problems with your boyfriend and I am meeting you to discuss the situation.
(embarrassed with a touch of unrestrained jubilation) Yes.
...yeah, my wife started getting on me about the lawn today. Im tellin you, its one thing after another.
So we pick up some (word missing)
You shouldn't have tucked.
My dad was a cook during the Korean War. Something very bad happened, ever since you can't get him near a kitchen.
(NOT INTERESTED) Really.
Hey, can I flip on the siren?
Jerry, this whole Ellen situation.. has gone far enough.
No way.
"These pretzels are making me thirsty"? That was one line! You got fired!
Who's that?
What happens to charter tickets when you don't use em?
No! I am not going to see a psychiatrist!
Abort! Abort!
I can't believe I missed Kramer. You know he asked me to go with him to California.
'cause I asked him about the raisins.
Well, she didn't BUY the big salad. I bought the big salad.
Maybe they're Wilt Chamberlain's.
Hi, Carol.
Not at all.
S, uh, Superman - he, uh, built the fortress of solitude up at the North Pole, to, uh, you know, sort of get away from it all..
No, no. I-I just want us to be... together.
Just like that.
You hear the way he talks to me?
That's pretty long.
(To Rachel) And, uh, you eat eggs, right?
Can I ask you a question? Would you mind switching seats?
(astounded) What? So, this is still not over?
I'm a bootlegger.
(As the Twix starts to move) Ha, ha, ha, ha! (The Twix gets stuck in the spindle right before falling. George begins to pound the machine) Come on! Jump!
What for?
Yeah, but if you still look closely you can see ah, a little bump where the nose use to be. huhuhuhu.
You mean a blessing in disguise?
Tommy C.
Would you like a chair?
Oh yeah, everybodys guy is the best.
(Definite) I'll take it in my room. (Walks off)
(Nervous) Nothing.
(Looking at her nose) Is your nose pierced?
Oh my god.
You said you grabbed it outta there real fast, right?
What do you mean?
A few days go by and a call is placed at a time when Sandy is known to be busy at work. Once the initial awkwardness is relieved with a little playful humor, which she [Laura] of course cannot resist, an invitation to a friendly dinner is proffered.
(Suggesting) Maybe she's a nudist. You know, those nudist colony people..
This is amazing. (George gets up to leave and shake's man's hand) Thank you. Thank you very much. . . . I'm going back in! . . . You'll feel better (to woman)
No, that's a fair question. It is, uhm... (nervous chuckle) Jerry, yeah. (to Cynthia) Jerry's a friend of mine. (to Russell) He uh, he gave it to me. Unbelievable how many addresses of people this guy has.
Morning, dad.
Why do I do anything? tsss...For women.
Excuse me, I've got a maniac stalking me, I'm not staying in the city.
Let's do it.
Wait a second. (George gets up and heads for the statue in Kramers hands.) I cant believe this! Let me see this.
To some degree.
Tim, who's the head of the Aryan Union, you or me?
Now Peterman wants me to go to the funeral.
Jerry, it's me, George, don't worry, I'll return it tomorrow, no problem.
Ohh yes, yes. Yes Jerry they were all over me. It was like Rocky 1, Hm. Diane came up to me, threw her arms around me
Hey, me too.
Did I tell you I ran into her last week? Ho-ho, she looked great.
Hey, hey! We're discussing something!
I dont know, 120, 130Then they sent some guys to sandblast for 6 hours. Tomorrow they are putting in asbestos.
Oh no, Morgan is a good man sir.
I have noticed she does tend to go to the bathroom right after we finish eating.
Why?
Like what? I'm bald? What is it specifically? Is, is there an odor I'm not aware of?
How would you find out something like that...wait a minute, what am I thinking? I've got the entire Yankee organization at my disposal.
"There's a lot of money in this.. He's got a proven sales method"
Simple joke from a simple man.
Whatcha got there, the 4-volt? Heh, I did you a favor.
Yes. Please. Please, let's go.
Ah, well, that's very mature. What about you?
Yeah, I know what happened.
What about all the loser stuff?
Jerry and Elaine saw you.
And Elaine is gonna keep him busy.
Well, they're more than an underwear to me Mr. Farkus. Two cups in the front, two loops in the back. How do they do it?
Nothing It's not you. It's me. I have a fear of commitment. I don't know how to love.
Faking? What makes you think that I have time to see doctors, take X-rays, make appointments, when there's absolutely nothing wrong with me? What kind of a person would do a thing like that?
I once told a woman that I really enjoy spending time with my family.
I'm really going to do something with these three months.
The table, the stereo, the VCR, the velvet couch, where's the velvet?
The door? Why would I go out the door? The window's right here.
Apply for a job? What for?
Did anybody see Firestorm?
(whispering) Glenda, can I ask you a favor? Can I have this seat?
(to the cab driver) Excuse me, do you see anything on my lip here?
Okay.
I don't know, I didn't ask.
[Accusingly] What's *that*?
I-I-I-I-I got it!!!!!
Jerry, come on. If my mother keeps shrinking, this is exactly what she's gonna look like in ten years!
Yeah. I got 'em down to fifty bucks. I just have to do all the jackhammering myself.
I was squinting! Remember that drive from Wortsborough? (snapping his fingers) I was spotting those raccoons.
Hey, I saw what I saw.
Y'know people, we got a situation over here!
What kind of a greeting was that?
It wasn't that bad.
You know, it's a miracle you're not married. (beat) Hey, I'm not obligated to buy anything, am I?
No, no. I reached down and there was *nothing* there.
You didn't find it funny?! This is what I'm paying for?
Yeah?...
That's cute.
Quick for a... catered affair.
Yeah, but get this, the message said 'call me if you have the time'. Heh heh if I have the time, you get it?
The Day..
(delighted!) Woooo!
A guy leaves a puddle of sweat, that's a signal?
Did you say dangerous?
Coming up.
Yes, well, you know, Im not thinking about the price. You know youre the only woman Ive never thought about the price. Get the lobster. I beg you to get the lobster. Go for the lobster.
...Who's not doing this for the money.
(considers, but got into elevator) Won't work.
Have you seen 'em?
No, no no. That skips a generation. The baldness gene comes from your grandfather.
All right, believe me, you're not going to marry him.
Ooooh, yes they do.
Yeah.
Wait, have you ever seen him throw up?!
I can't imagine.
Get out of here, why?
Do you speak English?...English!!
(animated) Fixed up? A cup of coffee! A cup of coffee is not a fix up!
The woman she's "lesbianing" with? Susan told me she's *never* been with a guy.
(Stern, trying to shut her up) Ma.
(CONT'D) Look at the time, that's it.
She didn't want to come, she-she's not really into sports.
Of course you do.
Im good.
C'mon Jerry, please! It won't happen again.
Oh geeeee. (George pantomimes sticking a knife in his heart, and twists it.) Go, go!
Why didn't you just say that?
You know, suddenly I'm in the mood for pasta primavera myself. (Jerry nudges George to sneak a peek at Molly's cleavage as she bends over and looks in her backpack. Jerry has a quick look, but George stares, hypnotized. Russell comes up behind George.)
You are aware that Pensky is interested in me.
Might be easier.
Good Morning!
Can I say one thing to you? And I say this with an unblemished record of staunch heterosexuality.
"I'll see you."
Yes it is.
Aw right YES! GUM! Good enough I'll take it.
Come on. Will you stop it.
She never came back from lunch.
[quietly] C'mon, go along...
Uh, please, Morty.
There you go.
Still upset. Very upset.
For a mental patient. Wait a minute, the phone, we'll call the police.
Uh-hmm.
I get the feeling when lesbians are looking at me, they're thinking "That's why I'm not heterosexual".
(suspicious) They haven't said anything to you, have they?
and JERRY Yeah.
Yeah, yeah. You gotta come over tonight. We can play.
How old's the son?
Yeah, you gotta do it classy (wipes his mouth to his sweater.)
Beautiful women. You know they could get away with murder. You never she any of them lift anything over three pounds. They get whatever they want whenever they want it. You can't stop them.
Wha? Did you use those? These are guest soaps! (he grabs the soaps and begins examining them for damage)
Well, I wouldn't want you to do that. You know there's a lot of losers out there.
No, no, no, no. Borrowing money from a friend is like having sex. It just completely changes the relationship.
(nods to Kramer) Tell him, Kramer.
So, I'm uh, I'm afraid we're going to have to pass.
Still, I bet when they gave him a plane, it was a lot nicer than this one.
What?
Hey!
It's a performance, Jerry. Like what you do.
how did I know you were here? Something drew me here. This is phenomenal.
Have you seen Jerry? (sitting beside Elaine) I told him two o'clock.
Curly.
Dont think it cant happen! (Leaves)
That's exactly what I told Jerry!
Me, too.
I see, well, thats open to interpretation. Because so much depends on the layering and the quality of the wetness in the eyes.
But enough about fish, huhuhu. I can discuss other things you know, ah architecture. Huhu. (makes a wide gesture with his arms)
So all right I'll speak to you through Jerry and everything.
I say fourteen o nine (1409).
I feel like I'm in bed with my mother.
I can't go in there. I can't face the bubble boy.
That's it?
Jerry, could you excuse us for a few minutes, please?
Are you looking deep down at the real person underneath?
Kramer, there's a guy out here that...
Why didn't you ask me? I know a million theater jokes. 'What's the deal with those guys down in the pit?'
Huh?
I did it! It's all done!
No no no no no no no..
The contest - I cheated.
What do you mean - "Not letting you?"
(Still with a tone) He is. You dont know what Im doin here.
Whadday'mean.?
Me? You see what he did here, you see how he tried to sneak into my space?
Yeah, well, I guess the only thing I can do is go into George Steinbrenners office and tell him he has to give her a raise.
Yes!
You should see what my father used to go through before he bought a car. He'd go from state to state. He was away for weeks at a time. It was like he was running for President and he was going through the primaries. We'd get phone calls from motels in New Hampshire.
Well, it's . . . much too low.
(broaching a subject) Hey mom. What kind of woman was grandma?
(shocked) What?
I thought you were meeting Kennedy.
You know, I could let it go for.. say.. a hundred and twenty-five.
So, you wanna go home and...make up, officially?
.....So what's your point?
This is all too much. So what are you feeling? What's going on? Are you like a couple again now?
She's, uh, she's heard of Merlot.
Well you missed a lovely little party that we had for Grace.
Yeah, sure. (big smile) Then my father will have no place to sleep. (snaps fingers) He's gotta move out.
What?
(jokingly) You are still paying for this lunch?
Oh, that's bad. That's bad.
Thanks again.
Yes, he's a clown!
There, there I'm fine.
Ohh.. Paco! (Flicks rubber band tward the kitchen) Hey, take a look at this. (Hands Jerry Kruger's check)
Celia broke out of prison. I'm sitting in my home, she shows up at the door!
Because Im not Latvian Orthodox. Her parents wont let her get involved with anyone who isnt Latvian Orthodox.
(Unsure) I don't a..
Parking in a handicap spot. Right in the middle of his United Volunteers meeting. When he got back, he chased after me with a baseball bat.
I'll have 'em overnight it.
Holy cow!
What do you mean?
All right, I think they have fleas there. So what...
Just as she was. Hey, Mario! Remember us?
And here's a roll that I think you may enjoy.
That is what Mr. Steinbrenner wants. He wants, everyone, ta, twirl around.
He's coming up?! (Moves to the door) I'll check you out later.
Sorry, Mr Wilhelm.
Yeah, and she's going to find I'm a moron. You know, people think I'm smart, but I'm not smart.
".....Well. I'm sorry. Call you right back."
You can't compromise your principles!
Ahhhh, Ahh, Ah, Ahhh, Ahh, Ah!
Well, don't they make a counter offer? How can they just cancel the whole deal like that? What kind of a maniac is this guy? I mean he just, he says no, and that's it?
(waving) How can I not think about it? Look at the size of this thing.
Jon Voight bit you?
(wiping the area with a hand) People think they're so important...
(to Kramer) Ah! You're just the man I'm looking for.
What checks?
Oh, what's the point? When I like them, they don't like me, when they like me, I don't like them. Why can't I act with the ones I like the same way I do with the ones I don't like?
It will be my first one.
Yeah, 5A!
So how was it?
I can't believe what's happening here. She hasn't taken her hands off me all night. She was always friendly around the office, but that was it.
Why did you even take it? You broke up with her!
How are they gonna make that book into a movie?
Jerry? Yes, I suppose he is white. You know, I never really thought about it. I don't see people in terms of color. You know, there's someone I'd like you to meet. Hand on... (To phone) Is Mr. Morgan in?
You just said you weren't tucking.
I gave. I gave everything I could Mrs. Sokol. but nothing was good enough for her.
I dont know. Theyre books.
What are you saying?
Oh. How's the guy?
(calling after her) But..
She didn't like me?
Yes. Me, too. I wanna be normal. Normal.
I mean, uh... I had fun ice skating.
The thing is...I'm supposed to be T-bone.
Ha Haaaaaaa... Jerry how do you like that.You see I get myself in a dizzy, I'm all worked up and for what?
Well actually I'm...
Oh my God! (coming out of bathroom) You know what I just realized?! If they get divorced an' live in two separate places? That's twice as many visits!
I cant. I met them. Theyre devout. You know, in the cab on the way over here, I actually thought about converting.
Soda. S-O-D-A. Soda.
All right. Okay, tell me what you think about this idea Extend the doors on the toilet stalls at Yankee Stadium all the way to the floor.
Oh, sure. Of course. (looks for place to set down flowers) Um, uh, could you hold these? For just a second, just a second. (grabs newspapers from trash bin, begins wiping windshield) Here you go, now don't worry about a thing. It's gonna be fine. Here we go. Look at this shine.
Hey, it's Georgie.
All right, all right. KNOCK IT OFF. Come on, let's go.
You know, about the uh, two of us getting together. And I know that I said I was engaged, but (laughs) uh, you know, it's really just something you say. It's like, going steady. You know uh, going steady, engaged, it's, it's all just stuff you say. (chuckles) Anyway, I was watching uh, My Cousin Vinnie, on the uh, on the tape the other day, and I was thinking that uh, you know, the two of us might take a meeting, as they say. (chuckles) So, what d'you, what d'you think?
(more excitement) You were gonna fix me up with her?
Let me digest it. Let me get my money's worth. Y'know what would be good is if there was someone else in the bathroom that could tell me.
...and, and maybe shell see me when she gets there, does this woman intend to spend time with me?
Alright, but no later, because my parents are coming back.
You can stuff you sorries in a sack, mister!
Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute, don't tell me, don't tell me. It starts with a . . . Duncan Meyers. Oh, wow, this is something. I haven't seen you guys in what, twenty years?
Svenjolly. (licking a little bit of peanut butter from his finger)
He's older, completely covered in filth, no whistle, but I think it's him.
Is that it?
Listen, Buck, I uh...obviously I don't need to talk to you about the importance of player morale, but uh...I've been talking to some of the guys, and some of them - I don't want to mention any names - but some of them...they're not too happy with the polyester uniforms.
You might want to try it...makes the movie more enjoyable, that's all.
(to various people as he walks in) Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Hi nice to see you. How are you. Good morning. (to the secretary) Good morning.
Um, hi, its George, George Costanza, remember me? The guy that didnt come up for coffee. You see, I didnt realise that coffee didnt really mean... well, whatever. Anyway, it was fun. It was... it was fun, so... oh boy, um, so... You call me back. If you want. Its up to you, you know, whatever you wanna do. Either way. The balls in your court. So uh, take it easy.
Into what?
(ON PHONE) It's a '76 Chevy Impala. They stole it right in front of the hospital. I saw the guy drive off in it. Well he's about five feet tall, hairless, pink complexion.. (Elaine puts her finger on her nose) looks like a pig. Yeah, alright alright, thank you, thank you. (Kramer enters) So any word from the "pig-man"?
(suspicious) You didn't say hello?
Oh, those, those aren't my keys.
Always late. Always late.
Well what if she calls me? What am I supposed to say?! (hand hits the table)
Im outta the picture. I am outta the picture. (laughs) Its only a matter of time now.
(In a really strange way) Good, good, do that.
I'm in line to buy.
So?
They don't want to see me anymore!
You know, Lloyd, I-I've been to the doctor (hands George the card) there's really nothing they can do.
Because I uh, I told her the truth.
Sure, dudes in this town are dime a dozen.
How come this sweater is only 85 dollars?
So what? Ill start talking to him, you know, casual, and Ill work my way around to it.
Really? (Jerry nods his head) Well, what if it doesnt stop? Oh, that I really needed to hear. That helps a lot! All right, just say something. Just start talking. Change the subject. Lets just go, All right? I cant believe were having dinner with Alton Benes.
I'd like to rent Breakfast At Tiffany's.
Cosmo
Take care. Take it easy. (Tom leaves with the casting director)
I'm engaged to Mr. Ross' niece. I'm probably gonna be taking over this whole place someday so if I were you I would stay on my good side.
Still marry , still marry.
Briefcase. (Shrugs and exits.)
My mother loves Hampton tomatoes. She's nuts for Hampton tomatoes.
Not a bad way to make a buck.
How gee what a coincidence.
All right. See you tomorrow. (George sighs, exits.)
Why didn't anything happen between you two?
He didn't say anything.
Pull it up a little bit.
Who's he?
Yeah, that's right.
Potato
Care to make it interesting?
I know a little. Besides, what do you have to know?
This is what they would do in the movies! It's a beautiful thing! It's like a movie! I'm gonna slip him a mickey!
So, just bring her here. This is all you really need.
What do you mean, oh no.
Oh, you might want to stick around Jerry. Mr. Thomassoulo picked the wrong man to hire because he was fake handicapped.
All right, okay. Let's go, details.
Hey
Look who's here!
what?.. that's ridiculous!
It's not the money!
So, you want to come down to Mario's Pizza with me and help me pick up the Frogger?
I love it! This is fantastic! Look at this couch, is this velvet?!
(Apprehensively) Um. I just realized. Ya' never gave me back the change from the tolls.
Makes the 11 gauge look like a cap pistol.
I didn't get any bread.
(really animated) Alright, alright. You see? This is why I hate writing with a large group. Everybody has their own little opinions, and it all gets homogenised, and you lose the whole edge of it. I'm going with jerk store! Jerk store is the line! Jerk store! Yess!
I'll bet you, how much?
She'll open!
Great.
Of course you can.
You wanted to see me, sir?
There he is. Right on time as usual.
Ma, don't cry!
That's right.
I just wanted to tell you that I really enjoyed Fair Game. I thought it was just brilliant.
So good for you.
(Also, over his shoulder) Not me.
Sorry I'm late.
but..why, it wasn't my fault, I .. you asked me a sandwich, I .. I make such delicious sandwiches Elaine
I'm excited about the pouty.
I have a ten.
What? I'm not eating bread now. I'm off bread.
What?
(angry that she believes Al was right) No he's not right. Al Netchie is not right! Alright I'm canceling the father-son picnic. I don't know what he's gonna do with all that potato salad.
Sorry. I'll just go back to my usual routine.
So we started drinking, and I'll tell you I don't know if it was the alcohol or the ammonia, but the next think I knew she was mopping the floor with me.
(takes a large bite - with his mouth still full, his speech is muffled) Oh, this is fabulous.
How do I get the hand?
How much money d'you think they have?
(bashful) No, that's me.
So you didn't turn her in?
Do you know what happens if I miss him? I don't get credit for the pickup and I lose my 50 bucks...
...And exporter.
Vivian!!
You didn't?
I meet this women, Sheila. She works down at the one hour photo pace. She's got this incredible smile. Like she's got extra teeth or something
20 thousand dollars?
No.
Thank you.
(smiling) Listen, I..I..I don't mean to seem forward...
Thirty.
Fantastic!
Right!
It gets here when it gets here. Would you stop ridin' me?
Is that right?
I don't know.
If Elaine wanted to get some coffee.
Whoa, whoa, you're not getting in my car with gummy shoes.
(looking over her resume) Well Miss Coggins you're ah, obviously qualified for the job. You've all the necessary skills and experience. But you're extremely attractive. you're gorgeous. Im looking at you, I can't even remember my name. So ah, Im afraid this is not going to work out (he crumples her resume into a ball) Thanks for coming in.
And then, then, then she leaves with somebody else! Never even, never even said goodbye! Never called me back.. Never apologized. Nothing. Like I was dirt.
What's for supper?
Fifty-fifty.
(While pointing at Jerry) Not me! Him! His fault! He betrayed me!
You know, I got this little swelling right here. (rolls up his sleeve to expose his wrist) It's kinda painful. What d'you make of it?
Yeah.
No...no...no, I hate to tell you this. Youre not gonna see this woman.
What, she's ranking you?
Uh, Mr Wilhelm.
Come on now.
You know, you could've just given me Neil's number. You..you didn't have to take me out to dinner.
Just the last few innings of a double-header.
(from the intercom) Yeah.
I got a message from the Rosses at work today.
(on tape, singing) "Believe it or not, George, isn't at home, please leave a mes-saaage at the beep. I must be out or I'd pick up the pho-one. Where could I be? Believe it or not, I'm not hooome." (beep)
Baah! There it is! You just said it! That's what I want! Now say it again, and tell it to me.
Ya gotta put on a show, ya always gotta give them a big show. You always have to be 'on' otherwise why would they like me? They'd just go for a better looking guy with more money.
(on phone, as Jerry gestures beside him) No, Lindsay, I had accidentally spilled coffee on the gentleman's windshield. Why would I do that? I have a job! Well, did she see a squeegee? Well, you're not going to make a dime without a squeegee. That's right, that's right, just tell your mother it was all a big misunderstanding. You won't regret it. Okay, I'll see you later. Buh-bye. (hangs up)
(surprising his parents in the kitchen) Welcome back.
Was it a scratch or a pick?
What is he talking about?
They were in here, I saw her put 'em in here!
What?
Jerk!
No, tell me.
Because he said I was going to.
I probably didn't hear it on the way over because of the street noise. (he panics) This is no good! I got to meet these guys from MacKenzie for lunch in half an hour!
Help, someone. (BUBBLE BOY is strangling George)
Oh, that's wonderful.
I am not buying something just to get change.
It was a good jig.
Yeah, and I - I heard you got on their good side. Now, what'd you do?
(to himself, resentful) What kind of a snobby, stuck-up, cult is this?!
Coulda fixed me up with Marisa Tomei. She said I was just her type!
What about jewelry? That's very nice gift.
alright alright
Hey, when you order from the waitress, get her to point to the menu. I want to see what finger she uses.
Whatever.
No, I would have picked up on it. I can always tell when a woman likes me, they always somehow let you know. With me, they could torture me, I wouldn't tell them. If anything I'd try to make them think I don't like them, then they think, "Oh, look at this guy, he's not even looking at me, he must have something going for him."
Well, I've given this a lot of thought, and I've gotta say...
Of course I'm all right. I'm here with my girl, Nina. And what better way to pass the time than gabbing with my best friend -- with whom there are no secrets. (Flashes two intertwined fingers) Like this. Since the fourth grade.
and SUSAN (nod)
You don't think you can buy the ticket yourself...? No, there, there...you sit, and I'll purchase the ticket for you.
How come you don't know what street are you on?
I tried to be nice. I wasn't nice?
Hey! George and Janet.
Why?
I'm telling you, that cashier is riding horses on my money.
Oh, God.
My name is not mentioned in this blurb...
I got rejected by a bald woman. A bald woman rejected me. Heh, you like that one? A woman with no prospects and no *hair*, told me that I wasn't her type. Apparently *baldy* likes a slimmer guy.
Knock it off, just sit in your seat over there you're distracting me. We're making incredible time here. I once went into Kennedy Airport from West 81st Street to in uh, in 15 minutes. hu uh. Oh, here hold this. It's uh, ten dollars for the tolls.
You don't? Boy, I think about it a lot. I think about it at my age. Imagine how much I'll be thinkin' about it at your age. All I'll do is keep thinkin' about it until it drives me insane...
(To himself) How am I gonna do this? I'm engaged to this woman? She doesn't even like me. Change the subject? Toilets were the subject. We don't even share the same interests.
So I tell Alec that I have to go to Paris for an undetermined amount of time. Then all I have to do is buy some post cards and have your parents mail them from Paris.
It's something . It's hope.
The song?
Oh, what are you, like, a Quaker now?
Right.
Jerry, I like being with her. Plus, I know where she is all the time. I have relatively no competition. An-and you know how you live in fear of the pop-in?
Never mind!
Yeah I'm, eh, in 'the market'.
That's where the electricity comes out.
This is by far the most exciting thing I've ever done.
Uh, heading out. Jerry really hates to miss the coming attractions.
So, you... you say you've been in the city all winter?
I got nothing.
What? You can't leave yet.
Well, I am not going.
Yeah, they're all through ruining my life. What the hell are they still doing here? Lemme see this pamphlet. Hm. All right, so I'll, uh, get back to you.
You don't tell him?
Hey, Ring Dings are better than anything you're gonna get at a bakery.
What kind of a sick, demented person wants another person's glasses?
Why?
I got a headboard.
Whatever.
Yeah? How?
Of course not...
For 50 bucks? I'd put my face in the soup and blow.
Really good looking?
Hi.
'Scarsdale surprise'. That's the musical about that Scarsdale diet doctor murder.
If I could talk to the guy for just a sec...
Listen, I gotta ask you I was a little concerned that perhaps I was responsible in some way for your, uh... metamorphosis.
Catch what in time?
Right.
Yeah, follow-up question, that'll work.
Why did you give him my ticket for?
Tonight's the night, right? Prognosis Negative?
Keith called you?
Screw the Drake!
I can't tell you.
(ignoring Jerry) I mean I'm not really working right now.
Nothing.
Hey hey hey, we're in a rush here.
Nope.
Seven-eight-four.
(out the window) Keith, Keith, up here. Can you do me a favor? I need you to go to the unemployment office with me. I, I'm Jerry's friend  the guy from the locker room,  I'm the chucker. It'll take five minutes. Wait. Wait.
That's what I'm saying.
We gotta get something. I don't want to go to that meeting on an empty stomach. Let's get some Chinese. You wanna order it?
?? get away??
What is that, immigrants come over, you show them how to act natural?
A wheelchair? What for?
Alright. (Holds them up)
Yeah, yeah, well, because of the cane. You should see the bathroom they gave me!
I can tell you this. If I am not in front of my house at six-fifteen, when my parents get there, they will put me on an aggravation installment plan that will compound with interest for decades.
I would imagine it's all naked.
(To Elaine) Told me the same thing.
I'm at the health club and while I'm in the pool, some guy walks off with my glasses. Who steals prescription glasses?
Well, you know... the friend meeting the new woman. I feel like I'm getting fixed up for a friendship.
Wha, where is he going?
Maybe she just wants to talk to me?
Does she care? No. Does anyone ever display the slightest sensitivity over the problems of a fellow individual? No. No. A resounding no!
I think that's what the back of closets are for.
Yo, Anna.
Jerry, Elaine, I give you.. Janet.
It's not me! It's the car!
So, tell him you're concerned about it and he should see someone else.
Well, live and learn.
Wait wait wait, what is she... (takes the milk can from Jerry and puts it on the table) What is she like?
You didn't get one?
Oh I don't know. Check this out.
Really? And Debby told me that she fell in love with him because he has all this perspective!
Well, Im going with him. Id like to... Ive never done a solid before.
(to himself) Yeah, you said it. (to Wilhelm) Uh, excuse me, Mr Wilhelm. Uh, do you really think... Well, is this downtown trip really necessary, you know, for the project?
Yes, it is exciting! All right, this is gonna be my new face.
Oh yeah, like you know.
One-one-thousand, two-one-thousand, three-one-thousand.
It's my only hope.
Mon...? No, no, I can't wait til Monday, that's impossible, I gotta talk to him now. Where does he live?
I know someone wholl do it. Shes good. Shes honest.
It is a horrible company. There's no management what so ever. I could go hog wild in there.
The show will be like a heart attack!
Where's the crazy man, Come on up.
Jerry? Jerry can you hear me?
Yes, a shame. That is exactly how I would put it. Now Mrs. Sweedler, with all due discretion and sensitivity, and taking in the whole scope of the situation, I just can't help but think that, the hospital is somehow responsible for compensating the other, still living 'victim' of horrendous, horrendous tragedy.
Personally I'm a little nervous about going through these things. I'm afraid I'm gonna step through into another dimension.
Standard?
I can't believe I get paid for this.
I feel terrible, I can't be responsible for breaking up a marriage. Oh no (starting moving for the door, Elaine begins to stop him)
Take it right off the chest...
Why?!
I don't see how I could perform sexually in a situation after something like that. I was completely emasculated. Anyway, it's not the only reason.
Just CALL!
Innocent mistake.
All right, so are you ready, so we'll go out and get something to eat.
Wa..Wait.Wait!......Who is this woman?
What's he going to do? That's exactly the point. Nobody knows what this guy is capable of! He fires people like it is a bodily function.
what rock?
All right, I'll ask her.
(answering the phone while walking away) Joe Mayo's apartment?
(still puffing)" Whoa!!"
Oh, she's got the hue. So, what's going on with you and Melanie? I mean, I know you're not getting married, but uh, things are happening?
Siena, I love you.
Lemme see this. (Tries to grab the papers.)
What?
Done what?
Oh, this is unbelievable. I'm stuck. Every time I think I'm out, they pull me back in.
Yeah.. yeah, we're - we're cool. (Knocks lightly. Kramer takes charge by knocking on the door louder. The busboy answers) Uh, I'm sorry to bother you, I was in the restaurant earlier and I was wondering if I could talk to you for a few minutes about what happened. (He gestures for them to come in. They obey) I hope I'm not interrupting anything. It's just that I think I may have - without realizing it - been responsible for getting you fired. (Nervously laughs) And.. and.. and I just want you to know that I didn't intend for that to happen.
Good thinking!
I have no power Do you understand? I need hand. I have no hand.
I don't know why I bother even talking to you.
Y'know, the funny thing is, somehow I find her more appealing now... It's like if I knew she was a lesbian when we went out, I never would've broken up with her.
Snoopy and Prickly Pete. Should I keep driving?
I'm interviewing all these annoying little overachievers.. finally, this kid walks in - Steven Koren - a regular guy.. likes sports.. watches T.V..
Alright, very good, very good...go fold your little balloon animals, Eric. Eric! (chuckles) What kind of name is that for a clown, huh?
Oh, what time is it? Eight thirty? I'll tell you what's on. You got Major Dad, Blossom, very funny programme...
Mark, is this true?
(inhales deeply) I tell you, Jerry, I'm feeling something. Something I haven't felt in a long time.
(leaving to the bedroom) I gave it to Cosmo.
(Definite) All together.
(thoughtful) Breakdown, huh?
Aw! Funny he's a funny guy.
Yeah. I don't think they'll be able to tell.
What do think I tell Jerry everything? It's not like he's my wife.
(spits out mouthful of food) Mrs. Enright! Mrs. Enright!
Well it's not fair, Jerry. It's just not fair. All right, all right. That's it. I'm getting out of this thing.
I love these people, you can't ask 'em questions. (getting excited) They're so mentally gifted that we mustn't disturb the delicate genius unless it's in the confines of an office. (worked up) When huge sums of money are involved, then the delicate genius can be disturbed!
And?
"It's the Kom Pau ... George likes his chicken spicy."
Susan, wait please... (grabs her) Please ...
What happened? Did he bring it up?
I might go there.
Don't worry, we'll find something for you. (Knock of Jerry's door)
(gleeful, to Estelle) You did?! That's Goood! That's very good! I'm very glad to hear that.
You thought she was good looking, right?
No one hails a cab like me. My hailing technique is unmatched. I get the wrist going from side to side and boom! Cabs are crashing into themselves to just pick me up. (a cab stops) All right, here we go. Let me get door. Feminists aside, I know women like the door holding. Here we are all righty. O.K. Jodi let's get together again real soon and say hello to your sister for me.
Must be one of those rich, spoiled handicapped people, who didn't want to do any work, and just wanted to sit in her wheelchair and take it easy.
So you slept with her?
I don't understand lunch, I don't know anything about lunch. Listen. Just because I got the guy fired doesn't mean I turned him into a bum - does it?
Anyway, I think the guy in the shower opposite saw me. He gave me a dirty look.
Ahh, Hey-Ho. ahhhhh (exhales)
I'm losin' it!
Tub is love?
I loved her!
Well, if I hear you correctly--and I think that I do--my advice to you is to finish your meal, pay your check, leave here, and never mention this to anyone again.
Well I've done that.
The second time I sent the noodles back, I tought she made a face...
Isn't that where they remove the--
I can't.
Wait a minute, she did a skin cancer screening at Peterman?
Yes, she's pretty. What difference does it make?
The sex wasn't so good?
(shocked and angry) You paid that crook?!
Dammit!
(doing the voice) Not at all.
I doubt it. You know what he's doing now? He's putting a pool table in my old bedroom.
Singapore?! Do you hear this?
Nobody tucks anymore.
Nothing. I don't know...just a little dirt.
But, but I'm disturbed! I'm depressed! I'm inadequate! I got it all!!
Now, see here, doctor.
What about it?
Well, you really did it to me this time, Seinfeld. . . . What the hell happened here?
I dont understand, you never talk to her about other women?
I don't think so, Vic. I've done my homework. '89 Volvo, that's the car for me, it's the one I want.
She is a good waitress.
What is Lloyd Braun doing here?
Oh! my god. Oh! man...
Pst. (moves in close with Elaine and Jerry) Wilkinsons got a bite on a new one. Petramco Corp. Out of, uh Springfield. I think. Theyre about to introduce some sort of a robot butcher.
I love the chop sticks. I, I personally prefer a fork but they look very nice.
No, Julie, Julie, don't insult me. You know, what difference does it make who pays for lunch. It's totally meaningless.
Yeah, yeah. He went into the bedroom and started sobbing.
Is it?
Look at this sparkle. (looks up, sees Lindsay's mother) Mrs. Enright! (runs after her) Mrs. Enright! Mrs. Enright!
(Frantically) Jerry, Jerry?
Hup! Hup!
Anyway there was all this tension. I asked her if she wanted to go out to dinner and she said "no, maybe we could get together for lunch." You know what that means.
SHEILA!!!
``Ponce de Leon''? But that was great!
So who am I to be thinking about someone's nose? I mean, I should be grateful someone like her even looks at me. I have no job, nothing. But I have to say, I think about the nose. I don't want to think about the nose. I don't ask to think about the nose, but I think about it. I go to bed at night, I tell myself, 'Don't think about the nose, forget the nose,' but I think about it. I look at her, I see nose.
Well, Danielle, (digs in his pocket) we should get going. I got a key made for you.
Right.
Exactly! Because neither one of us can't handle a woman all by ourselves.
I'm getting a makeover.
No, I uh... I use it.
You think she could be an 'it'? Could she be an 'it'?
You know, Einstein wore the exact same outfit every day.
Have to give him time on this hour.
Oh, so now I have to buy this whole chair by myself?
No, I decided to go with an '89 LeBaron.
Not necessarily.
Oh well, gracias El Commandante, gracias. Muy muy.
Wink.
But really, it's enough with the bar already.
Why didn't Kramer pick it up?
No, that's my only suit. It cost me 350 dollars. I got it at Moe Ginsburg.
Alright, here we go. You got it?
I didnt think ahead.
A biopsy!
I told her I was out o' soda, I went out to get some, an' I never went back.
What's the matter with you? Are you crazy? Why are you using my name?!
Glad you enjoyed it.
His personal file, I, I don't ask...
Boy!
No, I'm fine. I'm good. I'm very good.
She wants to keep it quiet. She... thinks we have a real future together.
What? I'm comfortable.
That's exactly what I'm trying to avoid!
You can do better than me. You could throw a dart out the window and hit someone better than me. I'm no good!
Dad?!
Hey, what this thing? Whew!
I told you, I told you! Ha ha ha! Ooh ooh!
Hey, whats goin on?
No... What guy?
Well I was dropping of the calzone money for the week.... Um shouldn't you be at work by now?
He never finished the sentence. He got a call, that was the end of the interview.
I don't even like to use urinals, always been a stall man.
When are they gonna learn that any news about China is an instant page-turner? (seeing Jerry with a small black device) What's that?
Yeah, I turned him down.
Let me ask you something. Could you tell if teeth marks on someone's arm matched teeth marks on a pencil?
Would you like a Pepto-Bismol? I keep them in my wallet...! (Russell goes into the bathroom and shuts the door.) (To Jerry) Do you think he liked it? (From the bathroom, we hear Russell violently heaving his guts.)
Talk to him!
Yeah, yeah, not fan talk, not gushing, you know? Actual conversation, I was incredibly articulate!
No, no, no Elaine.
You pick it.
Wax Museum.
What?
I'm following him.
(glances upwards) Yeah. Uhm, why did she die so young?
Yeah.
Who flips? Youll flip, Ill call.
Kramer.
Well I know how to drive.
It's about the show. It... No, it was...
(Once again, Identifying) The Outlaw of Josey Whales!
Yes, I sure did.
(absently leaving with it) Thanks.
Come on. We got all day tomorrow to come up with a story.
Timberlands. (Showing Elaine his boots)
It's OK. It's fine. She'll do it. I'm sure she'll still do it.
Somebody did that?
(Laughs as they leave) It's working already! (Both exit)
It's GEORGE.
Well I just stomped some pigeons in the park. They - they didn't move.
Huh, nggh [snort] Stop. (flirting with her he playfully hits her arm with the menu, then flicks it into the air)
He wants to meet you? I'll tell you what. I'll show up. He doesn't know we're friends. I'll pretend I haven't seen you since High School. I'll back up the story.
A mental institution.
Me, why?
Why do I get pesto? Why do I think I'll like it? I keep trying to like it, like I have to like it.
Yeah?
(handing over a bill) Can I get a pack of gum, please?
Would you stop that please. Would you just stop that?
People smoke, Elaine. My mother smoked. It didnt hurt me.
I know you did.
You're cuttin' me loose?
Eighty-six, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, ninety, ninety-one... Yup.
You already have an in. You have the same first name!... (no reaction) 'Jerry'!
Well I guess that's because I wear boxer shorts.
Yeah. The thing is, I, uh...I had this little zinger of my own I wanted to try.
Yes, I've seen a silver dollar.
Cleaning them out.
Oh, you spoiled, spoiled man. Do you now how much mental energy I expend just trying to picture women naked?
Well, I wanna put a picture of me and my boss Mr. Morgan up at the office.
Hi, I was just uh... I just had one little question about uh, my assignment.
How's her handshake? A little firm, isn't it? Maybe a little too firm?
No, No! She's going out with a friend of mine. It's only courteous that we should try and like each other.
I don't. Susan wants to have it out when Sally comes tomorrow.
What?
Boy you are really smitten.
Well I'm very excited about this. I've always wanted to see how those sketch artists do it.
He purposely mispronounced my name. Instead of saying, "Costanza" He'd say, "Can't stand ja". "Can't stand ja" ... He made me smell my own gym socks once.
(Persistent) Perhaps you could look again, please? Im very hungry.
And now for the trifecta. (Picks up a hand held TV and gets back under the covers.)
Hello.
I believe the doors on the bathroom stalls, here at the stadium, don't offer much by way of privacy. But I was thinking if we extend the doors all the way to the floors......
Well, go ahead, tell him.
She treated me to the Arabian mocha java.
Ah Ha.
How do I know, maybe, you know, maybe she wanted to be polite.
(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o. (Hes sitting on the floor in his Play Now office).
Did you just say vault?
Nothing. It's not YOU..
An' wait'll you see the dress that she's got. It's backless! Uh?! I'm finally gonna make a Great Entrance!
No. I like the ball! This is my One Chance to make a Great Entrance! My whole life! I have never made a great entrance!
Thank you! Thank you very much. (Jerry and Melissa stop and look at George)
You've never heard of Bozo the Clown?
Well, I guess these would be out of the question. (pulls out two pudding skins in plastic bags.)
No. But I was the only one at the table that didn't get violently ill.
You just hesitated.
(Gets up to leave) Well, scintillating as always.
Everybody likes pesto. You walk into a restaurant, that's all you hear - pesto, pesto, pesto.
Something's up, there's something in the air.
..Oh boy.
Hey, so, did you give that radio the old switcheroo?
Yeah, why? Why?
With the two of us?
You got odds.
Im fine.
What are you worried about, you know it.
I know less about women than anyone in the world. But one thing I do know is they're not happy if you don't spend the night. It could be a hot, sweaty room with no air conditioning and all they have is a little army cot this wide (Displays with French fry) You're not going anywhere.
Parker, I never said driver, I said parker, a great parker.
Okay, how about this? All right, we get married March 21st, the first day of Spring.
It's really nothing, it's like going to the dentist.
What's that?
And ah, Ill have the bacon club without the turkey. (raises eyebrows)
Because he's afraid she's gonna get hurt.
A fan? I would drape myself in velvet if it were socially acceptable. And look at this, hardwood floors!
All these years I've been chuckin' and you've never told me?
What are you guys doing?
( rubbing his eye) Ow, Ow you squirted me.
(surprise) Huh. I never heard you say you admire me for anything.
Shst, You should take the test for me.
Gee, Kramer, I uh...I don't know what to say.
I don't even know her sister but believe me, if she's getting traffic tickets, she's not that good-looking! Woah
Yes!
A different name for the butler? (Russell throws up again.)
Anna actually has respect for me now. (laughs/snorts) It's all over.
Where is she?
I, I dont know.
The car!
Well, unless you tell everybody you're dating.
Congratulations...congratulations.
Howbout sports? Do you follow sports?
(pointedly to Elaine) Oh. Thanks very much for yesterday, by the way.
I remember.. (Leaves)
Hello, oh, hello. You remember, ... Susan, from N B C.
Oh... make it stop.
Gee, I'm sorry... I got here first.
Hey.
He asked me to keep it a secret.
...What?
You know what? I could probably do this. Whats the difference.
Hi, hi, hi, You were wonderful.
Dad.
(he walks casually to Tom, and taps his arm) Listen. I know we've had our problems in the past, but we got a show to do tonight. Time to pull together as a team. Life's too short. I say, let's let bygones be bygones. If you took the raisins, if you didn't take the raisins-- They weren't even my raisins. I was just curious because it seems like a strange to do to walk into a room, audition, and to walk out with a box of raisins. Anyway, whatever. If you ever want to tell me about it, the door to my office is always opened. In the event that I get an office. You'll come in, we'll talk about the raisins. We'll have a nice laugh.
Hey, Jerry, remember Frogger? I used to be so into this game. Gettin' that frog across the street was my entire life.
Really? I thought you liked her.
What the Hell is a "Polar Bear"?
In motion. The wheels are in motion.
Well...I'll ask Susan about it later.
What are you doing?
I'd rather go to a hanging.
(Sarcastic) Maybe for her new performance piece she'll give birth on stage.
My cars a little crumpled?!?
Look, we're not gonna be that long anyway... we have to get to the "party"!
Get going? But we haven't really, you know....
Who, the Croat? [the tennis player]
Oh uh hi Hi, David
Lemme tell you sum'in. When Ponce looked in that mirror and saw that he hadn't changed, and that tear started to roll down his cheek? ... I lost it.
Why him? Why not me?
Maybe you don't have to be so funny. I mean, would it kill you not to be so funny all the time? That's all I'm asking. This woman thinks I'm very funny. Now you're gonna be funny, so what am I gonna be? I'm gonna be a short bald guy with glasses who suddenly doesn't seem so funny.
Lesbian wedding. How do they work bride and groom out, what do they flip a coin?
Yeah, maybe. (snifs)Where'd you get that?
Wendy? Is that the uh, physical therapist?
You think she should have said something?
...thirty-two, thirty-three-
(thoughtful) Yes. Yes.
What, Minelli's!?!
I'm "Pappy".
Yeah. No, no, no, wait a minute, I always have tuna on toast. Nothing's ever worked out for me with tuna on toast. I want the complete opposite of on toast. Chicken salad, on rye, un-toasted with a side of potato salad ... and a cup of tea. (laughs)
I have to do this, it's a matter of honor.
A mute would be good.
You want to hear more? The master bedroom opens into the solarium.
Wheret?
The one who always sits by herself?
Yes?
So?
Elaine
Me? Oh yeah.
You enjoying yourself? (More laughs from Elaine)
Really? ..You think.
That's David Letterman. I just saw David Letterman walk by. I'll be right back. (He exits)
I know what I'm doin'. In fact Mr. Wilhelm gave me one of those little stress dolls. All right. (gets up) Back to work. (acts annoyed and leaves)
(Shocked) You caved?!
She wasn't flirting with you.
Oh, no, Sir. Festivus is all too real. And.. I could prove it - if I had to.
Listen, maybe we shouldn't start writing today. I got a lot on my mind.
Oh! Great!
(still on the phone) All right fine.... Whatever
Please, doctor.
I dont know how you put up with this.
As you care for me. Which is why it is very important that you never breathe a word of this to anyone about the... you know. What, with Clarence Thomas and everything.
You're telling me. (he walks around and the suit makes a swooshing sound) So, what do you think?
What? Now, you listen to me!
Yup.
Why? Why is my code so important?
The catering hall screwed up. The wedding is delayed until June. It's like a stay of execution.
Who's Grossbard?
I'm gonna get a Chow Fung.
Why you going home for?
I said, Listen Marlene, and then the next thing I know, Im in the middle of it. And theres this voice inside of me going, Youre doing it! Youre doing it! And then she started to cry, and I weakened a bit. I almost relented, but the voice, Jerry, the voice said, Keep going, keep going. Youre almost out! Its like I was making a prison break, you know, and Im heading for the wall, and I trip and I twist my ankle, and they throw the light on you, you know. So, somehow I get though the crying and I keep running. Then the cursing started. Shes firing at me from the guard tower. Son of a bang! Son of a boom! I get to the top of the wall  the front door. I opened it up, Im one foot away, I took one last look around the penitentiary, and I jumped!
Well, aren't you something?
...but is there any way that I could possibly have Neil's phone number?
You know, all these years, I've always wanted to see the two of you get back together.
I was moving it across the street, I looked up and I saw Woody Allen and I got all distracted.
So, what, no lunch?
Oh, it's beautiful. It's in sports.
Yeah, I hope so. For your sake!
What's the massage situation?
Siege mentality, Jerry. They really want me out of here. Theyve downgraded me to some sort of a bunker. Im like Hitlers last days here.
I know, I know, I can't stop it!
Do you have something a little more... less expensive?
Okay. How about this?
Lemme see. I can't believe you got these for free. (Looking at the tickets) Row F?!
No, that's not it at all.
I'm not crying. And I shouldn't have said that about your wife. Please accept my apologies.
You're going back to New York now?
Uh, Rick..
I have plants. (snorts)
She works for NBC.
I'm in a transition phase right now.
Party?
Mr.Wilhelm...
Jerry, let's go! You ready?
The doctors thought he had cancer, but the surgery revealed he never actually had it.
Give 'im the jacket already!
What?
What clothes?
Oh, I was trying to make a point.
I mean you're just, you're just a marvel of organization.
Yeah. (another pause) Not that I care, one way or the other, but these doctors today really do amazing things, you know, if you were so inclined. And again, I'm not suggesting.
Clock over there. (to chauffer) O'Brien.
Do you know the last time I wore this thing? Six years ago, when I made that toast at Bobby Leighton's wedding.
(muttering)
Ah, great, great. (sniffs) What's that smell? Smoke? (walks to the kitchen) Hey everybody, I think I smell some smoke back here...(smoke boils into the doorway.) FIRE! FIRE! Get out of the way!
(going into the bathroom) Well, you on all fours, that thing vibratin', kickin' up sawdust, ho ho! She'll get the picture!
Dont you think you get more without it?
uh.. maana? huh maana might.. huh maana might be a problem, I'm supposed to have huh a boil lanced maana. Huh you know I think they charge me if I cancel with only one maana's notice
Is she the only girl in the whole world? Why can't you get find your own girl?
Oh yeah, al-almost. Almost.
I am not giving you my code.
Keith Hernandez? The baseball player?
Get out of here. I didn't see any cameras there.
Wait till you hear this! (George sees Donna and no Jerry.) Whoa, ah, Im sorry, I didnt, I had no idea.
(Somewhat stern) Oh, the thing's cancelled. Sit down.
No.
I tell ya, I hear people really stuff themselves on those cruise ships. (Laughs) The buffet, that's the real ordeal, huh, Clarence? (Laughs)
What d'you mean?
Oh, please don't tell me you love me again, Jerry, I can't handle it.
Hey, hey, hey! I dig.
Aw c'mon.
Betsy.
14 months. Maybe 10.
To do what?! Work in a post office? Is that what you want me to do?
She called my office. She said shes been in the Hamptons since Sunday. She didnt know if I was trying to get in touch with her. Her machine broke, and shes been using her old machine and she doesnt have the beeper for it.
So, we watching the movie, or are we still talking? (Joe's wife shakes her head and goes into the other room. George gestures to Remy to move.) Okay, c'mon. Let's go.
Holistic.. that sounds right.
I-I-I can't find my glasses.
Christie? That's the one you met in the antique store?
No, her too. And her mother.
I'll tell you what's wrong, a grown woman with a male roommate! It's unnatural, it's an abomination!
I don't even like to sit next to a man on an airplane 'cause our knees might touch.
Babs left?
Hello there. I'm George Costanza.
(Nervous) What are you talking about?
Well, there could be.
Oh. It's just horse manure (huh huh - laughs, he points back at the horse that walked by) Horse manure's not that bad. I don't even mind the word manure. You know, it's, it's nure, which is good. and a ma in front of it. MA-NURE. I mean when you consider the other choices, manure is actually pretty refreshing.
Hello?
We all got along. Everyone seemed very pleasant.
(on an imaginary microphone) Uh, no, not at this time.
Oy uy uy.. (Antonio points to the sink) We really should get going.
Oh No nonono I'm not a cop ...Heum... I work for the Yankees.
We did a crossword puzzle together, *in bed*. It was the most fun I ever had in my entire life. Did you hear me? in my *life*! Y'know?
(Still focused on the nudist) They're naked, the gardeners naked.. the bellhops. (Jerry makes a noise of astonishment) One big nude-a-rama.
Yeah, well when you don't actually do the steps, you can go through them pretty quick. You can get through six a day.
Should I not go on this trip?
Jerry, . . .
Did she do it on purpose?
And you know what else I've decided to do? I'm going to keep seeing the bald woman.
Yes, yes, I am.
Alright, lets get in there. Quick, quick, quick...
Well you know what I've discovered Mrs. Sokol. It's not so much the looking as the listening. I listen for work. And as I'm looking and listening I am also looking. You can't discount looking. It's sort of a combination. It's looking, and listening, listening and looking. But you must look.
Well, I'm just expressing my gratitude to our gracious host.
Well, I started to tell her and then all of the sudden, for some reason, I just burst into tears.
I don't know, maybe a safe fell on her head.
It's all pipes! What's the difference?!
Yes.
(clears throat) Heather Hi, it's George Costanza.
Im going to find out whats going on. All right?
Yeah, so?
Well, not really. After all, she did get together with George Peppard. I mean, Fred.
What's the worst thing that could happen?
What were her exact--
Hello?
No, listen; we are always sitting here, I am always helping you with your girl problems and you are helping me with my girl problems. Where do we end up?
Fantastic day! Fantastic!
Don't you see. She's looking at my pictures.
Alright?
Nah, I have asthma. (Robin's kid grabs George's leg from under the table, and George struggles.)
No, never mind.
What I don't get is, just because the battery is dead, you think she'd be able to roll up the hill with her hands!
I could take it in merchandise..
No, I'm gonna hold it under her nose so she can smell the scent of stale Bosco that I had to live with for three years, and I'm gonna say, "Remember this shirt, baby?! Well, now, it's payback time!"
Well, we were engaged to be married, uh, we bought the wedding invitations, and, uh, yada yada yada, I'm still single.
Watch the arm! Tim, listen, we don't want to bother you, we know you're busy here.
What?
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
Did you ever read anything by him?
I didn't encourage. No encourage.
You should have lied.
Totally folksy.
All right. At last, we're finally gettin' out of here.
Damn you, laser guy! You had to grab it all with your lowbrow laser shtick! You're just a prop comic! Where's the craft?!
Summer of '89 I'm at the beach. This family sits up next to me. I go in to the surfs and when I come from out, my clothes, my towel, my umbrella, they're all gone. I am furious, I start screaming to these kids demanding my stuff back and finally I lose it; I grab their boom box and I chuck it in to the ocean.
UH, ha ha, ... It's just SO frustrating. It's a brand new jacket.
Whoop! Too late. I think he picked up the scent.
Excuse me. Can I talk to you for a second there, Watkins?
(crying from the onion) You'll see I'm right.
(Gestures for Kramer to shut up) Once again, Antonio, I can't even begin to say how deeply, deeply sorry I am about everything. The job, the cat.. (A lamp breaks) the lamp.
What about me?
She'll Twirl.
You bought that?
What are you talking about?
Jerry. Jerry.
Don't look around. Don't look around. That's what he wants.
Yes, yes,.
what are you doing here?
yeah, I ... I snuck a peak. ... But it was so fast I didn't see anything. It was just a blur.
I did, I'm trying to call China.
Well, we would like to be in business. Let's do business. We'll have some business. Let's have business.
(hanging up) All right, Jerry. I'll do it. See ya.
You know this whole thing never would have happened if you hadn't bailed out on me at the restaurant.
What, like at a bus stop?
Jerry it's funny, Paula and I actually met because of Elaine.
Hey, Nina! (beat) I owe you some money, don't I?
Oh you mean face down on her chest.
I was curious! (imitating his moms voice)
I don't chew gum.
He didn't get better, did he?
Yeah.
Say good-bye to Koko.
No, no that can happen. Ive, uh, Ive read about that in medical journals. Its a freak thing, but...
Not.
I didn't say I was Ted Danson.
Really?
No, impossible! Its your apartment.
What? What did you do?
Listen, sweetheart, let me tell you a little something about guts. (Points to his head.) This is guts.
No. She tried to give me the "it's not you, it's me" routine.
(Eating) Oh yeah. These are fantastic, fantastic. (To server) You know, I'd love to get a jump on the next batch, where do you come out? (Server leaves) (To Anna) She's been ignoring this section all night. Quesadilla?
Do you believe this guy?
She put them in her pocket book. She probably took them out there with her.
She's not out there!
You won the choose.
(quieter desperation) They took my belt, Jerry. I got nothing to hold my pants up. (listens) Well, you gotta come over here now! Just tell 'em what we talked about, how I, how I, I didn't do the project.
Yeah! Yeah.
If this lip reading thing works tonight do you know how incredible this is going to be? It's like having Superman for your friend.
All right, listen, I'll see you guys later.
Did you explain to her about the good naked and the bad naked?
...he embibed her glistening spell...just before the other shoe...fell.
Imagine if I had to see them both on the same day? (mirthless) Haha! It's like runnin' a double marathon!
..That.
Some sort of electronic thingy.
Is this the ticket holders line, or the buyers?
What, you know Kramer?!
You're soured?
Yeah.
...Huh?
Chamomile's good. Lemon Lift. Almond Pleasure.
I don't want to! I'm outta money! I got 714 dollars left in the bank.
Wow,  god! You see this is all I think about. Sleeping with a giant. It's my life's ambition.
I know, they're out of their minds! It's fantastic!
He eats those?
I'm gonna hit the head.
It.
During that period when my folks were separated he went a little crazy.
Well what did you want her to do, you left it on the night table.
I see.
And then, (Smacks the money) there were two.
(grateful, relieved) Thank you! I'm gonna make you both so happy!
Hey, thanks. I owe you a big one.
Listen uh, David, I, I, I want to apologize about that comment
Yes, I am.
Gotta get the good ones.
No no. That's not what I was trying to do.
Yeah, my roommate in college.
(Interrupting) May I?
(improvising) My uh uncle is having an operation. I just wanted to see how he was.
All he has to do now is count his blessings, say a prayer, and he's done. Do you believe this?
Ive spent the last hour preparing ten candy bars with no wrappers or identification of any kind for him to select from.
Well, I still think you shoulda told me.
I want your honest opinion about something.
Where's the tamale guy?
Oh...(is about to tell Jerry, but reconsiders) ...clothing, something, I dunno. So, uh, what are you doing today?
Five' eight. Five' seven.
MOOPS, MOOPS
I think this is him right here.
March 21st. Hey! So, you're gonna back me on this, right?
Hey, was that a joke about Houdini?
Percentage?
You know, I think I'm a little bit scared of her. She's five-three, like a hundred pounds. I'm frightened to death of her.
Not as thin as you think.
You're Killing Independent George! You know that, don't you?
It's OK.
It's a funny observation.
You know, you're going along, you think everything's all right and all of a sudden you get that tap. (George taps his own shoulder). You know it's like pfffff (whistling sound), all right that's enough, you're through.
Embezzlement.
I think I was affected by the caffeine.
This is gonna be fun.
So he... had his hands and, uh, he was uh
What? Is that bad?
She said she liked me. No kiddin' she said that?
So what happened?
Hey, did I tell you I called one of those girls from the personal ads in The Daily Worker?
How come we never hear him?
Where did I get the coffee? Where do think I got the coffee, at the grocery store. (small laugh)
It's nothing.
What the hell is a gander, anyway?
Well it was a helluva yada yada.
Hey, you bastards.
"...It's the chicken"
Who puts a bench in their house?
Well that makes sense.
What's wrong? I'll tell you what's wrong. I just committed adultery!
Well, here you go. What do you think?
Channel eleven? Forgive me for trying to class up this place, for trying to have the Yankees reach another strata of society that might not watch channel eleven.
She can't take it. It's not hers, it's theirs. Once there's no theirs there's no hers, it should be ours.
What does that mean?
Thats why, you know, a shake is bad.
Well, maybe not married, but...
Yeah for two hours. She's nuts about you.
Don't be soured.
Oh, I wanted to talk to you--I'm sorry, I--didn't know you... (re Donna) had company. (Jerry indicates he should stay) Hiya, I'm George.
Did you ask her?
That?s not the issue, we're friends, if I?ve got to be uncomfortable, you've got to be uncomfortable too!
No complaints.
Yes, because the water was cold... and the chewing warms me up.
I looked up. I couldn't believe it.
Shut up?
Already you're marrying this guy?
You look like you're five years old.
Hey-- (spots Donna)
I am? What a strange coincidence..
Right.. the sign. (Hesitates, then makes a series of stupid gestures)
Yeah, it's bizarre. (they both look around them suspiciously)
Well...maybe not as much as this bastard... (points at Zeke, they all laugh) I can hold my own! (they all continue laughing and drinking)
(Stingy) Its wrinkled. Its worthless.
No.
(standing) C'mon, what're you talking about?
Where are you gettin' a Wizard for fifty dollars?
No, she left. Listen, you can't mention any of this to Elaine. Cynthia will kill me, we made a deal.
He didn't say he can't.
What's with this guy?
Ah, here it is.
(Panicky) Uh, yeah. You know, Doctor, I gotta tell you, I feel a lot better.
Right. So I call her up, I tell her its me, she gives me an enthusiastic Hi!
Forget about smelling the car. Smell the valet. Go to the source...
Puddys just gonna give you the car, huh? (Skeptically) Youll see. First they stick you with the undercoating, rust-proofing, dealer prep. Suddenly, youre on your back like a turtle.
It's the pesto of cities. So..?
No! (The salesman walks away. He addresses the mechanic through the doors window) Hey! Hey! I see you! That is my Twix! (The mechanic eats the last of the Twix, obviously to make George even more angered. It works) Oh, ha, ha! Ho, ho!
All right. So, you hold out your money, speak your soup in a loud, clear voice, step to the left and receive.
L-Look at this?
(Annoyingly butting in) Kinda like Superman's fortress of solitude.
...and then when I saw the photo I remembered where I'd seen him; the boom box incident.
Yes! I'm not giving him the satisfaction, it's my space.
I could go bumper to bumper with any one else on this planet!
It's not contest. The guy had nothing! The ship went down, he got into a life boat, I mean, come on.
Hey, go.
You've still got pretty good coverage. Once the enemy advances beyond this perimeter - (points at Kurt's head with a pen) - then you won't be Kurt anymore.
What Consumer? I'm the consumer.
If there's any doubt, I do a leave-behind. Keys, gloves, scarf -- I go back to her place to pick it up...(pop sound) date number two.
Huh, No kidding?
But I asked you before if you had a ticket, and you said no!
Who's dressing you? (Laughs) You look like a complete idiot! You know, I wouldn't wipe my- (Unable to take anymore, Leslie gets up and shoves George violently. His hands go straight for the hot iron sitting on the dressing room table. George screams out in agony) AAHHHH!!!!! (his voice is heard outside the building, on the street, and in the park were a bunch of pigeons are scared by the yelling)
Movies. I like to watch movies.
I didn't do it! It..It just got done. I don't know how it got done, but it did.
What happens if the husband dies after the wife, who brings in the clothing in then?
You sure?
Oh thank you.
(tasting the wine) Excellent. Like I really know what I'm talking about.
You're parents saw me on TV?
Well if you and I ever got into, like a really serious fight you know, and the punches started flying -- who do you think would win?
(upset) Could you put a little thought into this? Jerry's gone, you could humour me. He humours me.
Wait a second. I think I see where that laser guy is. No! Don't look! Don't look. Oh, yeah, that's him. Ok. I'm gonna sneak up on him. Now the hunted becomes the hunter.
Get a good night's sleep, alright fellas. (thumbs up) Big day tomorrow!
She cant even afford to go out to lunch. She's been eating in a high school cafeterias She pretends to be a teacher. It's pathetic.
Right. He cooks my food, he cleans my house, he does all my shopping for me. And there you go, that's your program.
No.
That's good, we'll give it a try...
"Ha..harrr."
Good night, Stan.
Maybe I could call my father.
Oh ya, This is my fiance, Susan. This is David
No harm!
That condom killed me. Why do they have to make the wrappers on those things so hard to open?
She calls you today and she doesnt make a plan for tomorrow? What is that? Its Saturday night!
No, we're not. We're not men.
It's a joke.
You be nice! He's giving me a parking space (echoes) parking space... parking space...
Right. Bye.
(To Jerry) Hey, gimme a dollar.
Its George.
I still paid for it!
(from bathroom) VANDELAY, SAY VANDEL... (George falls) ... Vandelay Industries, ...
Well, I can't crack this one.
(to Carrie) You know, the thing is, I kinda promised the widow Mantle that I would name my baby Seven.
Yes, sure, surely was. Yeah, I'll remember that day. Well I'll never forget it because that was the day that I uh, lost my virginity to Miss. Stafford, the uh, voluptuous home room teacher.
Dad, you know what it takes to compete with Microsoft and IBM?
You know, it's not the S.A.T.s!
Yep, this one for our side!
Hey, frolf?
You could pet them. They come right out of the water onto the sidewalks.
Mom? Dad?
What's to think about? If Putty says it's what it is, it's what it is. He's not gonna cheat you.
So you think you can put the suit aside and hold it for me?
It's probably chocolate.
Dad, the hinges are all rusted here. That's why the wind keeps blowing the door off.
Yes, it was very, very good.
A man gave me... a massage. hu, hu
I just can't believe at the way people are. What is it with humanity? What kind of a world do we live in?
The whole hour just flew by. (laughs - hehe) (Begins cleaning up the table.)
Get out of here.
Seemingly. Seemingly. But within that basic framework there are many subtle variations, only discernable to an acute observer, that reflect the many moods, the many shades, the many sides of George Costanza.
25? You don't have anything higher?
I had a job interview.
I hurt it in a hotel room. You know where they tuck the covers in real tight in those hotel rooms? I can't sleep like that so I tried to kick it out and I pulled it.
(Expressing shock) Woah. Whoa! Woah!
Jerry, look at my eyes.
Exactly. (Sees an off-camera co-worker) Erica!
Wednesday? That's your personal business?! (stalks over to the counter) Skiing?! (angry) So let people suffer, while you're shushing all over a mountain?
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, go. Go about your business, I'll just wander around.
Magellan? You like Magellan?
You had Sgt. Chadway? Me too.
(talking to nobody) Nah. It's probably a union thing.
Well, I wish I could say the same, but I must say, with all due respect, I find it very hard to see the logic behind some of the moves you have made with this fine organization. In the past twenty years you have caused myself, and the city of New York, a good deal of distress, as we have watched you take our beloved Yankees and reduced them to a laughing stock, all for the glorification of your massive ego!
We're straightening out!
Im nervous.
kissed me. We both had tears streaming down our faces. I never saw anyone so beautiful. It was at that moment that I decided to tell her that, I was not a marine biologist.
Yeah?
Oh! That's good judgment. That's a pile of judgment there. Sure.
Yeah, so what?
Yeah.
Well do you want me to take it off?
What?
Boy that-that bank clock is-is eight minutes off.
Every day she comes in, she sits at that table and reads. Never talks to anybody.
Yeah. Hey, thanks for doing this.
Oh, that's too bad. I kinda wanted to meet him, seeing as how we look so similar.
This is the life! Isn't it, huh, kid?
Who's your favorite chess player?
(quiet) Uh-oh.
I think we got a bite on it. (Exits)
Pretentious? Who, who isn't pretentious? Ha, ha, if everyone who was pretentious was in a mental institution, ... uh, obviously THIS isn't a mental institution.
Where's the depravity?
She doesn't like. Here is your blue one, it's her favorite. (Takes sweater out of his bag.)
Ya. That's what she told me.
I suppose I could just pull this out ( his tucked shirt)and walk around like this and you wouldn't care?
Who's Sid?
What? Did I what?
Ho ho ho ho! I can't wait for Hanke to come crawling back to me.
How come uh, no chair?
You disappoint me, my friend. Sandy wants nothing to do with you. She tells Laura, "If you want to waste your time with that pervert, that's your problem."
You know my driver's waiting, I really should get running. Good to see you guys again.
All right, forget that idea, it's not for you....Okay, okay, I got it. You run an antique store.
Why don't you call her agency. Maybe she's been out of town and she didn't get the calls.
I could be a character.
Know what? Ponce De Leon is sold out.
So what could I do? I couldn't go through with it. She threatened to kill herself.
This is my ketchup. I bought this ketchup just so I could have as much as I want.
Well, Tony.. took a bit of a tumble
What?
I'm bootleggin' a movie, baby!
Pick up the phone, Elaine. Pick it up!
Then afterwards maybe we could all go out together. Y'know she'll see me with my friends, she'll observe me as I really am, as myself. Maybe I can get some hand that way.
I'm sorry about that lock on the liquor cabinet. The combination musta just flown outta my head. It's a mental block.
She seems like an it.
What kind of a sick impulse does that??
I might.
What?
(in the threshold between the living room and the kitchen) The thing that bothers me the most, is the lying.
I cant believe I said that. You know me, Im a vault.
Oh my God!
Oh man! I knew I was gonna love the opera.
Hey uh, isn't Elaine supposed to meet us?
You know -- Elaine.
Sic semper tyrannis? What is that, Latin?
huh you tell her
Ade, ahh, ahh, ah ... Im giving you a raise!
I'll tell ya, if I ever get out of here, I'm gonna change my life. I'm gonna do a whole Zen thing. Take up yoga, meditate.. I'll eat right. Calm down, lose my anger.. (Sees Jerry and Elaine aren't listening. He snaps) Hey, is anybody listening?!
And people come in the store and you get involved in their lives.
Yes, please.
I hate this mall, there are never any spaces here...
Oh good.
(Stuttering) I, I, I, .. here, let me - let me help you..
Slippery Pete, Kramer tells me you are one hell of a rogue electrician. And shlomo, you're the best truck driver.
The way they make 'em these days, I'll never have to tell her.
(Slowly backing away, he's not at all committed to the conversation) Yeah.. television.
Yeah. Hey, you know, I gotta go get these tomatoes. You wanna go for a ride?
Yeah, good, good.
You know, when I was a kid, we didn't have these elaborate birthday parties w-with catered food and entertainment. I remember my 7th birthday party...
It was a fat camp. Those kids depended on me.
Embracing my roots.
Hey Elaine? Put me down for some of that art. 1,900 dollars worth.
Venetian Blinds.
Alright, bye.
Oh my God, an affair. That's so adult. It's like with stockings and martinis, and William Holden. On the other hand it probably wouldn't cost me any money.
What could I do?! We fooled around and went to a movie!
Here's the TV. I know you wanted to watch the Super Bowl. Do you at least have some towels we could sit on? It's, like, a four hour game.
I got it from the Institute. The Institute.
Clara Barton? What did she do?
What's the decision?
Well, he is. I, uh, I live around the corner.
This is just what I need.
Then, why? Why did you make me drive all the way out here? Why didn't you say something? Why? Why? Why?
They talk back. They go, "Hey George, how's it going?" I say, "Get the hell out of here!"
Yes, I am.
She was a delicate flower.
I know.
Oh my God! What is that?!
Oh, Hi, I'm George. (they shake hands)
Jerry, I can't talk to Jerry anymore. Ever since he moved into that apartment he's too much ... like you.
Wow. So what're you gonna do?
I know I was just telling them the story.
(playing with toys) Ahhhh, Yes! Touch down! Your turn, Jerry. (hands Jerry the Mattel Football. George starts playing with the Etch-a-sketch.)
(hurried) I'll see you.
Ha.
What are you talking about.. I WANT MY CAR!!
Shhhhh. If you want to get in, theres very little time. (calling to the waitress) Sweetheart.. (Waitress approaches and tears off a check. George stops her.) No, no, no. That ought to cover it. (He hands her some money; she turns to leave; George stops her.) Just a second. Just a... let me jus-peek... (He looks at the check, then takes some money out of her hand. George urges Jerry and Elaine to eat.) Come on, come on, come on...
Hey, uh...
Well, I didn't think anyone would play it.
Okay. Good.
If she want's to continue to have a fibre of her being she'll be very careful (hitting each other)
Well, it's less than twenty-four hours, so I guess I have to!
Canceled? Do I still get credit for the pick up? I was here!
What?
This. Just talking.
Hey.
The place went nuts.
Oh, nothing...
It's Juu-uu-une! Hey hay. Yes.
C'mon, you took my seat.
Yeah you did, you classed it up!
Eh...come oooon...(starts stabbing the paper with the pen. Mr. Wilhelm comes in)
Ever since I found out that you let that message on Jerry's tape recorder I...
I hate him!
You know a matron?
D'oh...Oh, oh, the judge! I hate this guy!
Silence YES!!
Yeah well, they won't know. I got the car there.
I-I just don't react well to these situations. My grandmother died two months early because of the way I reacted in the hospital. She was getting' better. And then I went to pay her a visit. She saw my face. BOOM. That was the end of it.
Well they're hard to load.
Elaine, this pilot...it doesn't matter to me, it's not me I'm concerned about...it's my mother. I've been over to the hospital to see her...
Oh I'm going baby! I'm going! (he leaves)
I cant believe- (falls on his knees) WE ALREADY DISCUSSED THIS!
Little Rock, Arkensas.
Would you wait a second? Just wait? (They fight over it.)
You got hookers turning tricks in my car. How's that for starters.
Lobster.
What?
You got less than sixty seconds. That's like dismantling a time bomb. What got into you?
Is he a clown? What, are you kidding me!?
I can't believe that you saw her before me.
And you met her in an antique store! I don't know how you do it!
Doing quite well, thank you. Yesterday I had a soft boiled egg and a quickie. You know what? If I could add TV to the equation, that would really be the ultimate.
Can we move on?
(Puts his hands on his face, rubbing his eyes) Look. It's a skill, just like juggling. She probably enjoys showing it off.
If youre a spirit, and you can travel to other dimensions and galaxies, and find out the mysteries of the universe, you think shes gonna wanna hang around Drexlers funeral home on Ocean Parkway?
Yeah, phew.
Barry?
What, what happened to you?
Senegal?
Tragic.
No.
The side?
What is this? The marble rye?
What the hell is this? George, Elaine and I went to see Chunnel ... with Jerry. With Jerry, huh? With Jerry! Great. Great! (dials phone) Probably went to the 84th St. That's where I always go with Jerry.
Excuse me just for a second. ( fixes his hair looking at his reflection in a coffee pot.)
You want to be with somebody that doesn't like you.
Where'd you meet her?
You're out?
Susan loves the sponge.
Look, I gotta tell ya...I been thinkin' about it, I just don't feel right about letting you into Elaine's apartment.
In a manner of speaking.
Alright, you're in for one-fifty.
Well. Gotta motor.
All right, come on, come on, let's go. Six dollars.
Yeah, anyway, she's uh, having some kind of a family lunch, I'll swing by after.
Hi. I'm ah, I'm here to see a Mr. Art Vandelay..
I don't know, what do women say?
Where'd you go?
So, how do you like the way I talked you into comin' down here?
Why does she want you to be mad?
(Reading the card from Whatley) "This holiday season a donation has been made in your name to the Children's Alliance."?
So, let me ask you. Do you think I could have done this?
And I can make a left turn from the right lane too.
Well, he has to play! He can't just not play. We're playing! Look, I gotta see him, how do I get in touch with him?
You remember the woman on the horse? She wanted my spot.
Well, it happened again.
Yeah. Eric the Clown put it out with his big shoe.
Y'know. About *us*.
Haha (laughs)
Noo!
I heard what you said "Sharon, are you there?".
Anyway, I was thinking about what you said. About uh, me and Marisa.
Yea... (sinks in) What? No, no!
You are!
Feel? What's that?
Now, I'm aware that my own physical dimensions are perhaps a little short of perfection.
(thinking to himself) Oh my god, there she is. That's the face, just like the picture.
Yeah, sure. I was showing a condo on 48th street. Besides, you think I wanna miss this? (chuckles)
So what?
No, the Portuguese waitress.
Yup.
What do you mean?
You wouldnt believe it. Rasputin.
I tell you everything, right?
And if I don't call...
She's bald.
(more nervous) What are you talking about?
All right, let's postpone it. Let's get out of here.
Okay! Alright!
I have a point, I have a point.
Okay.
Oh, yeah. Still in good with the ground crew. (Laghs)
Who's he?
945
(smile) Yeah.
Hey!
An ostrich burger.
Well, I am just a T-bone kinda guy. Love that T-bone. In fact, you might as well call me--
Well, I'm sorry, Timmy...but I don't dip that way. (takes a chip.)
Jerry took the couch back.
But I know who took the bite. It was her aunt!
Oh, well, uh. Gary told me you said hi.
Thanks. You know this could sound crazy but, what do you think about adding a drawer for - like a blanket?
Oh, uh...it's George.
Hey.
But if you think about it...26 teams, 162 games a season, you'd think eventually an entire team would get wiped out.
You want me to come back? Uh...
I did. I'm back. I love this relationship, I feel so liberated!
Well, maybe it was Ghostbusters? Where ever it was, it worked!
I know, but antiques are very popular right now.
No, I fake limp on my right. This is a real limp because I sprained my ankle.
No! Tell her.
Hello, Lloyd. How you doing?
It's "Guys And *Dolls*", not "Guys And *Guys*".
(getting up) Can I keep this?
We're in Turkey?
Well, sure. They're Jewish, and you're a shiksa.
I gotta go.
Missing his plane? Wasn't that a charter flight?
Well, I was wondering...
No, don't call her.
(somewhat annoyed) I suppose you could be an architect.
I would like an apology.
You wha?
But Mr. Steinbrenner, how can I be expected to perform my job properly, knowing that my uh, subordinate is making more money than I am? With all due respect sir, it's outta whack.
(negative) Hu-ho, boy.
What come on? Have you ever dated a woman that worked in your office?
Were up to two dollars here.
Quick, what's your favorite animal?
Your boyfriend reads the Daily Worker? What is he? A communist?
Yeah, like I'm going to risk my job with the New York Yankees to make a few extra bucks. (winks)
Girlfriend, yeah, right.
Nice to meet you.
We're out of Bosco!
They're shooting! They're shooting!
(Reading) I see your G.P.A's a 4.0.
Hey Kramer, c'mon-- it was 240 bucks twenty years ago...
Thank you for leaving me alone with him!
What?
Why not?
Alright, so I haven't put anything in it since sixth grade, I completely forgot about it. The State Controller's Office tracks me down. The interest has accumulated to 1,900 dollars. 1,900 dollars! They're sending me a cheque!
And then I took my pants off.
(worried) Alright, alright. Look, we're people, you and me, huh? Businessmen. Colleagues, if I may. Let's not quibble. We'll do it for the thirteen thousand. Thirteen thousand, and I never came up here, we never talked, alright. You take good care. (moving past Russell toward the door) It was nice seeing you again, and nice meeting you. (to Cynthia) Cynthia, right?
Really?
Yeah, so what? I'm not the only one! (Kramer enters with his quilt.)
Oh! Nuts! Excellent! You know what I love? How there's two nuts named after people. Hazel...and filbert.
What do they say?
I dont understand.
I need an outlet!
What's the difference, you're a woman. They're supposed to be touching you.
Yeah. Hey Jerry, listen to this. I discovered something even better than conjugal visit sex. Fugitive sex! Now, it's like everytime -
So the Wig master.......the Wig master said you could stop by the theater tonight.. and he'll show you around.
Maybe!.. And I'm moving back in there!
Oh, this guy tried to sneak into my space.
Dinner? (grabs Kramer)
Hey, I just found twenty dollars! I tell you this, something is happening in my life. I did this opposite thing last night. Up was down, black was white, good was -
Can we go now?
If we could just harness this power and use it for our own personal gain, there'd be no stopping us.
The Human Fund.
Yeah, I think I got a touch of something, too.
Oh.. nice.
Um, excuse me, have you see a guy with like a horse face, big teeth, and a, and a pointed nose?
It makes me look older.
These kids called me a Mary.
Someone's have to unhook the boat before it leaves...the place!
What? Why couldn't you think of something?!
Well, it's not that. I just, you know, I thought that we were both uh...
Sometimes at restaurants she talks to her food 'Ooh, Mr. Mashed Potatoes, you are sooo goood.'
Yeah...
Just..go back. Pretend the whole thing never happened.
Elaine, huh... Peterman account?
No, I don't know. Maybe you haven't. You know, not everybody's seen a massage table.
What happened to the pact? We were both gonna change. We shook hands on a pact. Did you not shake my hand on it uh?
So she coughed.
The story is the foundation of all entertainment. You must have a good story otherwise it's just masturbation.
I'm sure I will.
This is *unbelievable* B.O.
I think we have.
Hey, I know what I'm talking about. I gotta be honest with you, I gotta tell ya... Ever since I saw you holding hands with that woman, I can't get you out of my mind.
It's a very complicated move! I couldn't remember it all.
Are there terrorists on the plane? A hotel fire. Is that it? Malaria? Yellow fever? Lupus? Is it Lupus?
They were right outside!
Maybe I need someone who doesn't speak English.
I didn't know she took it!
(on the phone) Uh, Mrs. Ross? It's-it's George.
Sometimes it's good to have a pencil to write these things down.
You didnt say "junior".
What about her place?
Well, I've to every Brentano's. This thing's flagged in every database in town!
(clipping on shades) Ha.. She'll have to find me first. (leaving)
No.
(moody) Great! Now she's sour!
Good morning, sir.
Did you dressed nice, did you do it classy?
What are you, Crazy? I can't ask the guy for more cigars after you burned down his cabin!
That?s-that?s-Harry Fong, he's a very good friend of mine and he's a big opera buff. Enjoy the show there harry!... You know what.
I agreed to become his butler.
Well, I'm the boyfriend. Otherwise, what's the point of being the boyfriend? This is where you have to be when you're the boyfriend.
Yes. Now take off those pants.
(he just took a bite of the Chinese food ) This is terrible. What is this, ginger? I hate ginger. I can't understand how anyone can eat ginger. (puts the container back in the refrigerator.)
Make myself comfortable. What does that mean? Does she want me to take my clothes off? Is she taking her clothes off? What if I take my clothes off and she still has hers' on? Then I really look like an idiot. She could get offended and leave. So maybe I should leave them on, but what then if she takes her off? Then she'll feel humiliated. 'Make yourself comfortable'. I got this unbelievable woman and this 'comfortable'-thing can ruin me. I got it! I take my shoes off and sit on the bed. There, that's comfortable. She can't accuse me being unconvertible.
I just remembered, th-th-there's this Chinese restaurant out near Yankee Stadium, that puts flyers on all the cars.
It's in the vault?
Are you crazy? You take your life in your hands with those nuts.
What is this?
(considers for a second) I dont care.
Oh, sorry.
I know.
Between the car getting totalled, the towing charge and the fine, there's no way I can ever pay him back...
(hopeful) Everything?
Oh, its a lovely song. (singing) How do you solve a problem like Maria?...
(Holding his drink up to his mouth) Oh my gosh, I just had a great idea. She could come to the party tomorrow and read Gwen's lips for me.
All right, so what did they do?
Im not doing that.
Face up on her back?
Well, of course they're trying to screw you. What do you think? That's what they do. They can make up anything. Nobody knows. "By the way, you need a new Johnson rod in there." "Oh, a Johnson rod. Yeah, well, you better put one of those on."
(Not really wanting to embellish) ..I stopped by the house to drop the car off, and I went inside for a few minutes.. Nobody was there - they're supposed to be working. (Jerry and Elaine look at each other - enjoying the story) My mother had a Glamour magazine, I started leafing through it..
I mean, it's not fair. I've been going there for 7 years. She's been there 3 weeks.
So, the college cancelled the gig?
Oh, my God.. (Buries his face into his hands)
Really? I never heard of a semi (the "i" sounds like an "e") tractor-trailer. (Jerry nods in agreement)
Oh, this is huge!
I know!
I already bought it! I've been lyin' to you for three days, and now you're all screwin' me!
My Job..arghhh
a piece?
Jon Voight, the actor?
Ha, uh,
What?
Over here.
Jerry, where did you get that sweater?
(Looks fed up with his parents) Oh my God..
The weather guy, Dr. Waldo.
So?
I don't want him to!
Yeah, the kind that Castro smoked. You can't buy ?em anywhere.
(stares at card)
You like ice?
Oh leave Jack alone. Jack's got enough problems. I'll just take the small office.
I don't know. A little thing called Step Nine? Instead of an apology, he was beboppin' and scattin' all over me.
Why? Because we're a team! C'mon! Would you take this for us, dear? Thank you very much. Here we go... (To Morgan) Anyone ever tell you you look a lot like Sugar Ray Leonard? Yeah, you must get that all the time.
Who?
Ah, Oh boy.
What's that?
For lunch? Who eats eggs for lunch?
Flame on!
It's right in the explosion scene. So if you could just...leave me a little window. You know, my, uh, my aunt had a thing removed with a laser. All right, I don't want to interrupt your meal, so...
Oh, God...
Oh, oh. Uh, you know. It's the damndest thing. I, uh, I moved recently and my files, pfff, disappeared. Now, I-I don't know if they fell off the truck or if there was some sort of foul play but let me tell you something. I'm not through with that moving company.
We are really late now. We're in big trouble. Big trouble.
Simmer!
Yeah. And since you go buy there everyday. I was hoping that we could help each other out.
I didnt know there was a fireplace.
(to Jerry, as Jerry nods in agreement) You know I think she might have something there.
It may have moved, I don't know.
Yeah.
I heard the last guy got fired because his nose whislted.
Yes. Yes. You know what's interesting. The quarterback for the Atlanta Falcons is Bobby Hebert. No "r" which I find fascinating. You know it's Herbert h-e-r-b-e-r-t, Hebert h-e-b-e-r-t. "Hebert" it's a fun name to pronounce. Try and say it Hebert. Take a shot. All right. (check arrives) All right. I
George, George Costanza!
I guess I've been hanging on to them for so long cuz i couldn't accept the fact that Dad was really gone forever (hugs a piece of clothing)
Really? (Realizes) Well, you don't think it had anything to do with what I said, do you?
Laura, sure.
I am ready.
Where did you get that from?
She's bluffing...
Our show, "Jerry"?
Head start, oh no absolutely not.
I dont know, what? Eight thousand. Its a Hyundai. Get out of here. I told you not to sell. Simons made money, Wilkinson cleaned up.
Ah, enjoying them?
(through a mouthful) Long as they don't throw 'em on the field. (laughs) Huhu. (indicating dish) Help yourself to some shrimp, I brought enough for everybody.
I think that's one of mine.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
(still quiet) The actress.
Wa?
No, it isn't.
Cold? How are you going to do that? You're not one of those guys.
"He jumps!"
I'm gonna slip him a mickey.
How are we gonna get out of here? We need a plan!
(pulling out some money) Uh, yeah. Hang on. Just... yeah.
Pleasuring you?
He just read it. (Russell vomits again. Jerry and George look ashamed.)
Aha. Aha. Could it be because you don't want him to know that you have a friend who pees in the shower, is that it?!
Yeah, and now someone's going to be taking messages for me.
I'm getting nothing.
What am I scared of? I'm scared of the same thing that you are, everything! Why don't you just use your own name?
This townhouse?
I wanna go to a tractor pull.
(feigning excitement) Great, great. O-Oh, oh, oh, gosh. You know, it's just... my duties with the Yankees...
That's got nothing to do with it.
Wha?
How much?
(Jerry is going to his bedroom) What?
No we're not.
You know, I can't remember the last time I called a woman without being nervous. I, usually, I'm pacing all over the room, I'm...
This is a cartoon!
I leave you alone for two seconds, and this is what you do! I trusted you!
I think I got it. How 'bout this? How 'bout this? We trade Jim Leyritz and Bernie Williams, for Barry Bonds, huh? Whadda ya think? That way I have Griffey and Bonds, in the same outfield! Now you got a team! Ha ha ha.
All right, do you mind? I have the window! (To Willie) Now, what are you gonna do about my Twix?
Jerry and Elaine. They made me nuts.
Oh oh oh, all right, fine, Jerry, you win. Take it, just take it!
Well, you could move in with my parents. (chuckles)
Yep. There's one liiiittle problem.
I feel alive, Jerry.
Stop it! It's nothing. It's a stupid holiday my father invented. It doesn't exist!
(still quiet) Think, a second. You know, your friend was talking about me and, you know...
It moved! It was imperceptible but I-I felt it.
No no no, that's in the right position.
(In awe) Wow!
All right, stop it! Stay away from my breasts! Chest!
That's pretty paranoid.
Gonna see her again?
Hey, Jerry, what was the name of the exterminator who fumigated your apartment when you had fleas?
Why don't you just commit yourself already?
What do you mean, I got? You didn't give him his Visa application.
There was no meeting. (gets one of the folding chairs) But it was quite a meeting. You are looking at the next director of Mets scouting. The only thing is, I have to get fired from the Yankees first.
FDR?
Why would I spend seven dollars to see a movie that I could watch on TV?
Five minutes. What the hell happened here?
Danielle. Where's Neil? (indicating the bed) Is this him?
No, it hit the table, it hit the table.
So, what do you think?
I'm interested.
I can't run, I have a bad hamstring.
What's that?
We did?
Yeah?
Hello, Rick.
(Laughs, snorts) I said, I said 'Get outta here! No story? Is that what I said?'
The name's George Constanza. I'm starting work here today. I was wondering if you could tell me where my office is.
You've got a bet.
I'm not really sure, I...
I gotta buy a present now?
No.
What do you think it's a bomb?
The Ray Conniff Singers. (nervous chuckle)
So, you need me to get fired.
Elaine.
She any good?
That's a shame. (Karen is shown singing off-key on the television.)
Bone marrow.
You had to hop! You had to hop on the plane.
You've got to start seeing someone else. Get out of this relationship.
No.
I never heard of that.
Wa, uh, thank you sir, you know I am not quite sure I'm right for it.
Nothing.
Where's Kramer?
It's very complicated.
Well, Jerry. There was a pretty good chance I was never gonna have sex again anyway.
You don't understand, there's a *blurb* about me in this magazine!
Now if you will kindly help me unwedge my front wheel, I'll be on my way.
He said he didn't care. Oh, God I love that place. Hey, have you seen other dermatologist?
Elaine, what are you doing?
It wasn't funny? What, are you kidding?
Reparations!
(staring at the wreck) Whatever.
It was a good idea. Susan liked it. Now, if he hadn't vomitted all over her, we'd be writing it right now.
Rick.
No, I-I-I know... [retreats back to his Chinese take out] I know...
I'm very disappointed to here you talk like that. You still don't know what makes me tick.
Aww.
Yes.
I solve problems. That's just what I do.
I couldn't help it! Elaine moved the mirror, I got discombobulated.
(feeling awkward) Its uh, not bad, its comin along. Why? Did you need something.
And I'm moving out of my parents' house, I'm taking that apartment on 86th street, remember the one we saw?
You're out?!
That woman was unequivocally the worst date of my life.
Cracks? What were they saying?
Ahh, ladies, please, please. (chuckles)
He said what?
'Cause Neil Watkins from accounting is T-bone!
I think I had some hard candy in there.
Ah, beat it, punk.
I'm going out with her tomorrow, she said she had some errands to run.
Yes, yes, you know I was in detention and she came up behind me while I was erasing the blackboard . . .
Yeah, right.
Where did this come from all of a sudden?
What a world that would be, if you just could ask a woman what shes thinkin.
Whoa, whoa, a section?!
Maybe I could just use the bathroom.
I spilled some Chardonnay. So, what did you get?
So, what're you saying?
Ah, Pfft! What can you do? (looking at a tag on the suit) Is this the price tag?
It's just that I was the one who actually paid for the big salad. She just happened to hand it to you. But it's no big deal.
No! Get out of here, Newman.
Well was it a woman?
Very nice
How is this effeminate?
Im keeping it. Im going down with the ship.
I'm getting married?
What is that, Boyfriend? I don't understand that. What, what does she think I asked her out for?
Hello. I'm O'Brien.
Hey.
Artie Schuman? From Camp Hatchapee?
(to Susan's stone) ...And then, right after the All-Star Break, we, we just swept the Orioles. Four games. In Baltimore. (adjusts necktie nervously) So... yeah.
Yes of course go ahead. My guess is you're going to like this very much.
Yeah, that was enough.
Finished.
I can't just leave.
Jerry, just remember. It's not a lie... if you believe it.
Alright, maybe four.
There might be some moisturizer.
See, It's not so hard.
(worked up) I can't have a cup of coffee with a person?! I'm not allowed to have coffee?!
You think?
Fine.
Except for one small problem. Hah, I left some books in her apartment.
I'm sure I have a low IQ. I've been lying about my SAT scores for 15 years.
No?
Thirteen thousand?
Let's say it comes down to me and one other guy. He's got a nice quiet suit, and I'm whooshing all over the place! Who do you think he's gonna hire?
Learn guitar, first lesson free? Huh.
Yes! Yes, I heard the 'squink'!
Oh, I was uh, I was waiting downstairs for the jackhammer, thought I'd drop by.
I love Juu-uuu-uu-uune!
Youre not getting no Drakes Coffee Cake for fifty cents. Yae, Hey, Im all set. I got the ticket. Im going to the Cayman Islands this Friday.
I told you to stop with the hopping.
We are going to the Knick game! Michael Jordan!
Korea.
What's the difference? You know they way I work. I'm like a commercial jingle. First it's a little irritating, then you hear it a few times, youre hummin it in the shower, by the third date it's (sings) "By Mennen!".
I don't know why I'm doing this.
Oh, every chance I get.
So what have you been doing with yourself?
(smiling) That is really nice.
(Laughs) Relationship intern...hey, what if two of us teamed up?
These are not "scraps." These are historic remains of a once Great Society of Hair.
Yeah.
This is a *great* idea! Here... use this one. I get frequent flyer miles with every purchase... Wait! Get two tickets. As long as your turning it in for a refund what's the difference? I'll get *double* the bonus miles.
Maybe a black.
Purple 23.
(defensive) So what? So what if I do?
(inside bathroom) Nah.
(phone rings ,picks up) Operator? Beijing?
Do you uh feel the way you feel after the Risotto?
You know what, bad mistake my mistake do me a favor go back to the other lane - you'll never get there - forget this lane - y'a kn ow what this lane stinks - go back to the other lane - bad decision - go go go take this light - take this light -
She comes out of the bathroom, I'm in up to my wrist. You should have seen the look on her face.
Yes, sir.
It's a talent I have.
Not now Florice.
Pbbbs, Bubkis!
Ah-Ha! (he turns and walks over to the refrigerator)
Well why couldn't you include me in your excuse?
You know, it was really wrong of you to back out on that deal.
Oh, it's locked?
What, are you crazy? I can't have a man touching me. Switch with me.
La-la-la-la-la-la-la! [flashbacks to Susan]
Huge matzoh ball.
I dunno. I guess I have to wait for her to die.
What does she need? Maybe there's something that she needs.
(depressed) Feel like I can't do anything wrong.
Told me to "Go to hell!" and I took the bus home.
I tell you this. If the real Phil Rizzuto was down there, this wouldn't be happening!
I dunno.
Too bad , it's all done.
Don't worry. We won't forget!
Mr Reichman?
That's right, Ricky Boy, it's me!
That's right, no discount!
Yeah, I know that. (clears throat) Could you start, working?
I am. The folks are twelve hundred miles away. (gleeful) I'm basking in the buffer zone. (looks for the waitress) 'Nother piece of pie here!
Huh?
See, Steinbrenner is like the first guy in, at the crack of dawn. He sees my car, he figures I'm the first guy in
It's a huge problem, Jerry. The hardest part about having sex with a woman is getting her to come back to your place! He's already got that.
Listen, you go over to the ticket counter, I'm going to go stop in the gift shop and pick up a copy of Time magazine. There's supposed to ba blurb about Jerry in it and I think he mentioned my name!
Well, you never know. (picks up more shrimp) Let's see how many I can fit in my mouth.
...Why?
(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o!
Aaaaaah
Well George . . . .
Well, I think you're wrong about that. [Elaine walks past the window again, glancing in] And ah now if you'll excuse me, I'd really like to get started, please.
I tell ya, I am hooked on these books on tape.
My father wears his sneakers in the pool! Sneakers!
No.
Well, I'm not buying it. No way. Forget it. No way I'm buying this! (beat) I mean, look at it! What is it? It's a bunch of squiggly lines! (beat) Are you telling me you couldn't paint this?
(Still mad a Leslie) Never said goodbye. Goodbye!
Why not?
They, uh... said you were with some guy who was wearing a cape?...
(to Elaine) You dont tip a gardener!
No!
He's getting on a bus, damn! (To the blind man) Those are nice glasses.
So.....She's dead?
No. I didn't get it.
(sniffing) Hmm. Game hen?
We're gonna hang around here a little while....something funny going on here
...meet the Mets. Come on in and greet the Mets.
Aah, yeah, yeah. Won't you head on in, we'll be in in a second. Be right with you.
Puke! That's a funny word. Puke. (laughing) Puke! Don't have to think about that.
Maybe I'll go down to the track. Put it all on a horse...
Dogs, twists, a kind of fermented chicken drink.
You know, they say ostrich has less fat, but you eat more of it.
Huh. Excuse me (to Ping) Hum... Do you speak chinese?
Nice day today.
All right. (tearing his jacket off) Let me just say one thing there is no way that this is gonna happen. You hear me? No Way! Because if you think I'm going' to two Thanksgivings, you're out of your mind!!!
And on your dates.
What are you talking about?
(Munching on a hamburger) This Arbys is good.
Oh with all due respect, I went there too, and I work for a team that just won the World Series.
Pssh. Would the protg pick up stuff for the mentor?
Yes, you have to be Murphy.
hey, you know what? I just remembered something. I had a dream about that guy last night. This is amazing.
(to phone) Hi, Allison? Oh, I guess you're not at home.. I probably should 'ave tried you at the office. Anyway, good to hear from ya, really looking forward to the ball.. (hangs up and happily chuckles) Ha ha!
Excuse me, did you say 'Raymond'?
Jerry.
Absolutely nothing.
(singing) Oh hey, if you happen to see the most beautiful girl who walked out on me. Tell her I'm sorry. Tell her I need my baby ... oh won't you tell her ... I love her. Oh hey, ...
What trying to get off the phone?
Where was pesto 10 years ago?
I can produce Keith Hernandez right here within the hour.
(Inquiring about the chalk board) What is this?
Hey di ho
Listen Jerry. With all due respect, Bania's voice is the voice of a new generation. My generation.
It's the same menu.
Oh, that's the worst part of it. He looks just like me.
Not now.
Jerry, you came for the big moment.
It stinks.
Oh! Dropped a napkin...(Whispers) Jerry!
Well I-I...
(Entering Jerry's apartment with a cartload of computers) Jerry, I've found a way to beat Lloyd Braun! I buy the computers myself, I store 'em in your apartment. Then, after I win the contest, I bring 'em all back and get my money back. Ha ha! It's brilliant. What? What's wrong with your leg?
That's dynamite. Yeah, I'll look for the Chinese food leftovers.
What?
I was just blowin' off a little steam. So what?
All righty, no reason for us to uh, raise our voices.
Keep going.
I broke 'em playing basketball.
Well this worked out okay. So are you going to see the police woman?
How'd you get that?
Oh, please ... ... four dollars is f...
Yeah, it's me sir. It's been a harrowing few days. uuh,After the car accident, I-I crawled into a ditch, and managed to survive on, grubs and puddle water, until a kindly old gentleman picked me up.
(interrupting) Elaine. Shut up.
Oh, okay. (Starts to walk other way and then walks to their room and goes in)
(Places the doll presumingly where it belongs on a shelf) Ya?
Oh yes, Mr.Wilhelm, yeah...
What could I do? Did you see the mug on that kid?
You didn't like it?
I just don't think it's such a great idea for you to sit here.
What kind of money you think your parents have?
Oh I beg to differ. My father took great pride in his appearance, he was a very handsome man, a casanova really.
Okay.
That's a little steep don't you think?
Elaine, you have to sleep with me.
Did you get the shot?
..And I went down there one time to see...
And she'll still see it, you're not stopping her from seeing it.
Yes.
I don't think we should see each other any more.
Me too.
So, I guess I was lucky that I never tried that myself.
He sold me ladies' glasses!
Well, why didn't they ask me?
Why did the policeman have to yell at me like that? (Elaine enters)
Yes! Yes! Everybody has to like me. I must be liked!
Well, you see, what happened was...the doctor - the very same doctor that was attending to my late aunt - suffered an untimely stroke, and lost the use of his right hand, so...obviously I was unable to get the death certificate. However, I do have this. (Reaches inside his coat and takes out a Polaroid photo.)
Look at me! I am man! I am you!
Yeah, look at me. Now I GOTTA FIGURE OUT THE HAT SIZES OF 59,000 DIFFERENT PEOPLE!! WHAT IF A PINHEAD SHOWS UP. I GOTTA BE ON TOP OF THAT.
Kramer, she's a model.
Celia? W-w-what are you doing here?
Ade, I have to tell you, I, I have never met anybody so ... efficient.
No..
I had a great time tonight Carrie. And I am going to call you as soon as I get home.
Hey.
Milano.
Oh, I think that's fantastic. Good for you. Nice. That's very nice.
Yeah.
It is too!
(thinks for a second) I got used to it.
(Vowing) Well, I'll tell you this, though - I am never doing.. that , again.
Would I have had access to that?
Wh-Well maybe you should ask Elaine.
If not mine, whose?
Oh, this is all locking in now. It is all locking in! (laughing)
Ill meet her outside the building.
He was definitely sniffing.
You mean one of those vinyl things?
All my life I've dreamed of sitting front row, behind the dugout!
(singing as he exits florist with bouquet and a cup of coffee) "...tootsie, good-bye. Too-too, tootsie..." (takes a drink, makes a face, shouts back at shop) You call this coffee? (dumps out coffee behind him, accidentally hitting a parked car's windshield)
(Whispering to Jerry) What time is our flight back? I got to go to the bathroom.
No. Why must it be so difficult? Why is there all this tension and hostility? Why can't I just walk up to a woman on the street and say, "Hi. I'm
Really? (feeling flattered)
Do you hold the neck together with one hand, or are you just letting it flap in the breeze?
I'll shout.
(to Jerry) How could we not hear anything? What's with this Russel? What's he doing? (Jerry raises his arms and shoulders like he doesn't know)
Well, I'm, I'm just looking.
Alright, but I'm serious about this.
And the Christian rock?
(ecstatic) What? You're moving to Florida!?! That's wonderful! I'm so happy! (pause) For you! I'm so happy for you! Oh, what do you need this cold weather for?
Four hours.
Yeah, eighty-three. Used to belong to John Voight.
You got bumped from career day?
Would you excuse us for a minute Tim boy, we're kind of in the middle of something.
(Confused) What photo?
I just wanted a second opinion.
Oh, it's good.
Do you wanna talk about hotels, or do you wanna win some ball games?
What, is that the one your parents gave you?
My parents don't read! They're gonna wonder what a book is doing on the table!
(urgent) Move a pinkie, if it's yes. Can you move a pinkie?
So, what did she say?
What?
So you're talking...
Hey oh.
Hi, nice to meet you.
I don't want Morgan's job. He's got a lot of work to do. Hey, Elaine, your friend never woke up Mr. Morgan.
Yeah, and, ... Why won't this go down?
No, I didn't hear anything.
What's up?
That's what I'm afraid of. You know Mr. Steinbrenner, . . .
I know, but he's your son.
You see? We were made for each other. (Thinking to himself) It's amazing. If I reach out and touch her breast right not, she'd scream and throw me out of the car. But at this time tomorrow, I could touch it all I want.
I'm starving. We should have had lunch first..
Do you really think so?
Alright, we're back in!
What?!
What, you didn't ask him about the car?
No, no,
Well, he said it could be cancer, maybe you should get it checked out.
(to himself) You can't tell much from those pictures.
Well, sir, I - I gave out the fake card, because, um, I don't really celebrate Christmas. I, um, I celebrate Festivus.
I was all primed for the first row; I was gonna put my feet up on the dugout!
Are you sure?
Were dying here!
Morning Thunder has caffeine in it, Jerry doesn't drink caffeine.
But you didn't use a coaster, Jerry, you left a stain! (he runs to kitchen)
You are not gonna believe whats going on with this woman.
So I set up a screening, everyone takes their shirt off and click, I snap me a shot of a bear-chested Kruger.
Discovered the Mississippi.
(Scoffs) ARe you kidding? Lincoln Center. Alice Tully Hall, the Met. Magnificent facilities.
I'm sorry, uh, it's not like I'm gonna see something I've never seen before.
I don't understand, how do these thieves start the car?
Maybe Karen is faking.
I guess I should be, but Im not.
(Motioning toward waitress) I think she likes me.
Yeah!
You should be the one criticizing me. I, I'm lucky to even know someone like you.
Good.
I got a source.
Huh. What, the whole apartment?
Did he just steal the raisins?
Yeah.
"'Cause when he questioned me about it I was sweating from the Kom Pau.."
All right, if she puts the bags down before she greets you, thats a good sign.
Well, they're obviously not here.
Five-foot four. Why?
You know what you should do? You should tell this guy you're seeing somebody else. That's the easiest way to get out of these things.
My favorite.
I don't want hope. Hope is killing me. My dream is to become hopeless. When you're hopeless, you don't care, and when you don't care, that indifference makes you attractive.
You know what? I changed my mind. I, uh, I don't think so.
So, did you get your new plates?
Aren't those the guys that always go crazy and come back with a gun and shoot everybody?
They're cuffing him.
It looks like it hasn't been washed.
It'll have to be a night job anyway. You don't normally work after dinner, do you?
There's a bag of Pepperidge Farm cookies up there.
Yes I suppose they are.
Joe DiMaggio.
What happened to the screen door? It blew off again?
Ok, we got your...got your strawberries, your chocolate sauce, your pastrami on rye with mustard, your honey...
(standing) All right, I'm gonna move my car, my meter's up. Can't park in this city.
I, I can't believe this is happening!
Hey, 'The White Shadow' is on...
We just go up to him, we say, "We're O'Brien."
Wait a minute. I must have been winking down at the office. That's why Mr. Wilhelm was acting so mysteriouso.
On an elevator? You met a woman on an elevator?
I forgot to ask you; how did the revenge date go?
I'm going to the bathroom.
Yeah, go ahead, call.
Hey Kramer.
Hey! Great plane! Thanks a lot. Piece of junk. You know you almost got us killed!
Maybe I'll just meet you there.
Why is that?
You know what? I should really go talk to her. Nothing confrontational. Just two adults sitting down trying to clear the air. You know, I just know if I could spend some time alone with her. I've got to. (he grabs his jacket) I've got to.
Then, I'm at The Foundation...
We...must never ever speak of this again..
Oh, sports are so pedestrian. I've prepared some science experiments that will illuminate the mind and dazzle the eye.
Hi, it's me. It's Georgie Boy. What's going on?
Hey!
Um, excuse me, I - I think you forgot my bread.
Im aware of you. (to Jerry) All right, lets go (opens the bathroom door) Lets go!
Yeah. see you later.
Remember when you came to audition for us?
Boy, even I never heard that one...
Haven't you kissed her?
Now if I wanna see anything I gotta wear these.
I was in the middle of a conversation.
She knew I didnt have a job, she knew I lived at home. Didnt seem to bother her. I think I could have married this woman.
(very casual and raising his hand in the air) Yep. That's five!
I got about fifty-feet out and suddenly, the great beast appeared before me. I tell ya he was ten stories high if he was a foot. As if sensing my presence he let out a great bellow. I said, "Easy big fella!" And then, as I watched him struggling I realized, that something was obstructing its breathing. From where I was standing I could see directly into the eye of the great fish!
Cmon. Wilkinsons got millions invested in this stock. Its gone up three points since Ive been watching it.
Hey, what's your guy's name again?
Yes I do.
Well, I was very comfortable! I've got my nuts here...
I don't.
Oh, so you don't believe me either?
No.
Perhaps.
Whatever. Believe me, if I wasn't involved right now, I wouldn't mind being set up. Something tells me she's a knockout. (we see, from the camera inside the cab, George's hand waving as the cab drives away)
He's not here?
There's something I have to tell you.
Oh, I understand. (George exits; Sees Kramer in the hallway) Hey.
Really?
Who paid?
Yeah, she's very lovely.
How come?
George
I insist. Ill fix us a drink. (phone rings  who would that be?) I got it.
Well, Play Now is through playing. They turned the heat way up in my office. They tried to sweat me out.
Five-thousand? Why would anybody buy Kramer for $5000? (laughs)
yeah....euh...I dunno What?
You're Murphy!! Look, let's just jump out of the car.
uh, Uh, Vandelay Industries, is uh. 129 West 81st street. It's a very small industry Vandelay. It's one of the reasons I wanted to uh, work for them.
Well, you know, it's really very funny, because you know what we got here, really? We really, really, just have a terrible misunderstanding. You see, when I passed on the deal, I thought that's what Jerry wanted me to say. Y'know, I, I misinterpreted.
I'm uh... writing a pilot for NBC...
You think she's happy?
No, that's the Netherlands.
(To the man behind him in line) Yeah, right Im gonna get my car repaired at a dealership. Huh! Why dont I just flush my money down the toilet?
No, you're not out there.
Oh no I'm in already come on.
People break up all the time.
No you wouldn't. Nobody would. It's just that... they were missing, and... well I'm just inquiring. (chuckles nervously)
(Thinking to himself) She's not concerned about the security guard. What kind of a person is this? I'm marrying a person who doesn't care that this man has to stand here 8 hours a day when he could easily be sitting.
So let me ask you a question about the tip jar. I had a little thing with the calzone guy this week. I go to drop a buck in the tip jar and just as I am about to drop it in he looks the other way. And then when I am leaving he gives me this look think thanks for nothing. I mean if they don't notice it what's the point.
Hey.
I told you those trips were relationship killers. Too bad you cant get your buddy Superman to fly around the Earth at super speed and reverse time. Youd get all the money back, you could have avoided the whole trip to Vermont...
(not expecting the statue to be thrown) Dit.
You heard it fifty times already.
Yeah!
(eager) So? What d'you think?
All right, great.
Yeah, take care. Stay in touch.
From me.
I'm positive I gave you a twenty.
"Ah! your just mad 'cause we beat ya."
No.
Thanks a lot. I'm really late. My parents are waiting in front of my building and we're stuck here.
I really can not comprehend how stupid people could be sometimes. Can you comprehend it?
Come on over and sit down.
(pause) What do you think, Jerry.
"Cold showers? They're for psychotics."
It's fine, it doesn't have to be about nothing.
Let's see if it's Hayman?
Oh! I know....'Cos you don't think Janet?..
I'm not gonna give you my card unless you tell me what it's for!
"How's it going?" - beautiful.
(Loud, so everyone at the wedding can hear) You slept with the groom?!
That damn delicatessen that - that is last time they screw up one of my orders.
Oh, yes. I - I'm your baby bluey.
Wow, is she not terrific?
It's MOOPS.
How much is that?
What company was it?
Take the suit.
Are you a religious man, sir?
Isn't that why we have locks on the doors?
Hey! what are listening to?
It's in... transit.
I'm writing.
So you're against me now?
You can go crazy trying to figure that place out.
(animated) What're you kidding me? We were all getting along so well. Where is all this coming from?
Hey, where ya goin'?
Who is Sir Arthur Conan Doyle?
If I see things as they are, I would ask 'why' or 'why not?'
What happened to the auto show?
Oh, it's a bad day. Uh, you got everyone in your house, you're thinkin', "These are my friends?!"
(Looking at his finger) I think somethin bit me. I just need another nickel.
Kramer, what are you talking about...Janet doesn't look anything like Jerry
That's unbelievable.
Krama. Please.
Alright see? We got something there.
I mean, batteries have gone dead before, aren't they prepared for that?
All right go ahead Susan, tell him.
Unsettling?
Allright, I gotta head back right away, I'll-Ill -- I gotta figure something out here.
You mean in the end?
Oh, I was gonna pay for this.
Yeah.
He knows the worlds theory.
Really? Why?
She's too tanned. It's the middle of the winter, she's like a carrot.
How nice?
All right. Let's get to work.
Well, I was buttering myself up for a nice shave --
(running out and away from the van) I knew it wasn't Berkowitz!
It's not him!
Oh, you know, Lloyd, I really don't have it.
This is Morning Mist.
Does the heater even work in this car?
Alright, that's it. Alright, good, eight thousand dollars. (to Cynthia) Cynthia, again, nice meeting you. Have I commented on the shoes? I love suede, it's so thick and rich. Did you ever, you ever rub it against the grain? Alright, anyway...
Alright, now. What mood am I in, what mood am I in?
(signs) Sorry. (expectant) You're sure, uh, there isn't anything else?
(Interrupting) Anyway, I just wanted to let you know I'm really sorry that happened, and if I can help out in any way, I'll certainly be glad to do that. (Pause) Well, I guess that's about it.
Should I take some?
Especially her. She does not like disappointment. Well, I have to do it. I can't make December. There's no way I can make December. Right? I mean, you can see that, right? I mean, look at me. Look. Look. Can I make December? I can't make December. Right? Look. Look.
So do I, but I wouldn't hang it on a wall.
This is it?
(chuckles) Really? Well, we'll just see about that. Ta-ta, Tut-tle.
Let me put that on speaker phone.
Hey Elainie. What's going on?
Well have you got a picture?
Taste this, is this a dill?
You think it's something?
My face! My face! Get me to the hospital!
(pauses for a few seconds) OK, I'm tellin' you right now - if your kiddin' around I'm not gonna be able to be your friend anymore. I'm serious about that. You got that.
What's he yelling about? They're stealing jackets here!
He..he wants to talk to me?
So you're telling me instead of them being happy to see me, they're going to be upset because I didn't bring anything. Ttst --You see what I'm saying?
What's going on? He still wants to have dinner with us?
I got it. You wanna get her something nice? How 'bout a music box?
You know, like all the comedians always say, 'How would you like it if I came to where you work and heckled you?'
No. This is not cotton. Here, lemme see. (Tries to look at the tag on the uniform. Tartabull gets creeped out and resists.) Will you stop it? (Looks at the tag.) Oh. Of course. Polyester!
This is incredible! This is one of the greatest things I've ever done in my life! I'm gonna call my mother.
So?
(chuckling to himself) Housewarming gift. (swerving the car to go to the antique stand) All right, we're taking it up a notch!
Really?
What do you think I mean bald? Bald. Bald bald.
Flowing?
Can I uh, can I walk you back to work?
Yes, I am familiar with this syndrome -- she's a two-face.
You know, I'm down to one kiss hello. My aunt Sylvia.
All right, all right.
Took a shot.
Didn't they notice it?
I told you.
Aw, hoh, oh Deena, thank God. (he hugs Deena) Thank God you're here. Listen, you gotta help me. You gotta tell these people that I'm okay. You know that I don't belong in here.
Eh eh eh, can't do it, can't do it, sorry, I got a date.
I am such a Huge whale fan. These marine biologists were showin' how they communicate with each other with these squeaks and squeals, what a fish!
What?
Listen, I have a tremendous favor to ask.
Well, it comes and goes.
Heh he, I made it.
Well it's tough to get a good read but I think if I brought him a chair, he'd sit.
One of your guys - Kip, or Ned, short name - stole my Twix candy bar!
I don't need any ideas. It's a show about nothing.
You?
Miss Rhode Island? When are you seeing her?
Jersey.
(Takes a sip) Hey, it's not too bad..
(smiling) I'm on a winning ball club, Jerry. They probably wanna pick my brains.
Elaine...let me just explain something to you. See, this is not just a weekend routine...I'm on the verge of make-up sex here. You know about make-up sex?
What do you need her for? There's a million lawyers.
Well I still think it was wrong.
Of course not. You don't care what I look like.
(quietly) That's uh, for the two of us.
You can't leave! This is an ambulance! This is an emergency!
Hot? (Feels Tartabull's material.) What is this?
No problem.
Hey, buddies.
Yeah! You're right.. You're probably right.
I don't know, it sounds like pigeons or something!
What?
How many people does he do that for?
Ohooo what are we going to do? I'm shaking! I'm shaking!
I'll try some on and see how they look. It's just hair.
This is nice.
Jerry?
I'm not through here, Jerry. (Picks up the model of the conference room.) I'm gonna keep on investigating. This thing is like an onion. The more layers you peel, the more it stinks. (Pam enters, George leaves.)
You know what this means? I can't see her anymore either.
(talking on the phone) Jerry you gotta bring me some clothes down here. I lost my job with the Yankees. I'm standing in the men's room on 43rd street in my underpants.
Yes.
OH MY GOD!!!
What?!
Her scalp was clean. She had a nice skull. There just wasn't a lot of hair on it.
I don't know. I don't think you're anything.
Oh, there's a difference. It's subtle.
Every night at six-thirty. The nurse was gorgeous.. then I got a look at the patient.. (Laughs, then snorts) I was going nuts.
Yeah. I can't get over it.
You talked all about that?
That's a myth.
Play Now thinks I got problems in both legs. My own personal Rascal, Jerry. On the house.
This is great!
Waffle maker.
Didn't hear anything...
I think it moved.
Hey-hay! Lloyd! Hey! My friend Jerry eh.
I didn't even know Fulton was in the hospital.
I have to get in touch with Tatiana! And look at his little outfit. It's all so coordinated, the way his socks matching to his shirt. I really hate this guy.
I got a job interview. They want to see me this afternoon.
How do you know it was her dude?
She did. Today.
I'm going.
come on it's just a game.
If anyone should be forced to leave that place, it should be her!
(shouting) Get your Paliachi!
(Walks off) I got a lot of thinking to do.
Your hair?
"No!...not...nothing."
Oh! my God!!......You?.....You?...That was you?....
Lemme tell you something, that Jerry Lewis? You wonder how some of these people get to the top? It's ideas like this! Brilliant! Hah-hah! (Notices that the briefcase is damaged.) Look at this - what the hell happened? The whole side is damaged here...and the lock is broken.
I told you.
Just walk.
(TO WOMAN) Hey, is that necessary?
What did I get or what do I say I got?
Oh, I know.
He'd just be touching your back too.
And your wine.
The next morning, I woke up, and it was going like this. (moves his arm slowly) I can control it if I really concentrate. But otherwise, (arm moves) oh.
What? Nothing.
You're throwing the set?
Nothing...little problem.
Where we gonna eat?
I still won't be able to forgive myself - but at least it won't be about this.
They are?
Thats my candy line-up! Where are all my cards?! Theyre - theyre all on the floor!
I can't hear you.
(double takes) What's that?
She dragged me down to that warehouse on the waterfront in Brooklin to see one of her "performances".
Uh. (smiles) Where's the boys?
All right, I'll tell you what... why don't you go into the store and I'll wait in the car?
You owe me ten dollars.
It's my space!
What did you do?
(pointing to himself) Like me?
I suppose I could.
Well I just got back from swimming in the pool. And the water was cold...
Don't you see what this is?
Well I was lost, I never saw the first one. By the way, you mind if I watch it here?
Dad, what's all this?
No, I don't have any change.
Yeah, yeah, and we started talking, and she's this lawyer who's incredible! Everything I said was funny! You know, she laughed at everything I said, she thinks I'm hilarious. You know in a way, it was almost too good. I started so good, I can't go any place but down now, ya know? I got no place to go.
(he makes a sign to Jodi to wait and turns to Jerry) Jerry... This woman hates me so much. I'm starting to like her.
(snorts) C'mon.
(Impersonating Carson) I didn't not know that. Weird. Wild. (Susan and George both laugh)
Start looking for a job.
You know, Jason, I, uh, I couldn't help notice, I... I didn't get my apology.
And who's responsible for making hate mongering and fascism popular again?
Oh, don't look. T-This is the part where they change me.
Just tell her whatcha want, they'll make it for ya.
Elaine could be a character. Kramer..
Hello.
Im letting you in.
rush? you want a rush? drop a ball on your toe my friend, talk about a rush, you'll be throbbing, you'll see visions
Jerry, would you do me a favor, close the window.
Oh...you're very good.
I got a feeling I'm gonna be much smarter than you pretty soon.
(holds eyes wide open) Get it back!
Excuse me, I'm sorry to bother you, I noticed that you have a textbook on tape. May I ask where you got that?
Mr. Pensky. I was just working on your file. I was transferring the contents of the file into this flexible accordion-style folder.
You don't know what that spot means to him. Once he gets it, he doesn't go out for weeks.
Ttu (wipes nose and sniffs) Ttu.
(reading the tabs) Jerry, yours is eleven dollars.
Well, me neither.
I'm sorry I'm sorry, here's the test. Thanks again for doing this - hhe.
Let me ask you something. When you go into a store, does it bother you that they make the security guard just stand there all day?
I don't even know Peterman. How the hell am I gonna relax? I'm gonna have to be on all night. I don't like being on, Jerry, I would much rather be off.
What number?
She told this couple she had an affair with a matador.
George Costanza. Susan's, uh, friend? Long time no speak.
Really?
Hey, speaking of which, I found a great way to separate the skin from the top of the pudding without leaving any around the edges; Exacto knife.
(after waitress walks away) I don't believe it, she did it again!
Hey! Uh--listen--did you get your--uh--boss's Knick ticket, for Kramer?
Jerry? Jerry! I'm busting! I'm busting!
Yeah, I'll zip in, "How do you do?", zip out. She'll love me.
I hate asking for change. They always make a face. Like I'm asking them to donate a kidney.
Yeah, two for the 715 of Novaj pravas (?). What you're wearing the green sweater?
Jerry drinks Morning Thunder?
Now, because of that stupid rye bread, I gotta keep them all separated for the rest of my life.
Five' eight! Five' seven!
I didn't know he'd get fired.
Duty is *nothing*. It's like sales tax...
You tell that son of a bitch no Yankee is ever comin' to Houston. Not as long as you bastards are running things.
Well, it's the damnedest thing. The cat dies. So she comes back into town, she finds the cat lying on the carpet stiff as a board.
Oh, yes I am. Mr. Thomassoulo likes to play dirty. Well, theres nothing dirtier than a giant ball of oil.
A vet?
Really?
You're fresh (grabs her arm) You're very fresh. You seem very fresh to me. You're very vital. I couldn't take you any fresher.
I couldn't. You know, if it's not about sports, I find it very hard to concentrate.
Unless she goes for the bathroom. Thats my only chance. (George crumbles. He drops the cassette on the table.) Who am I kidding? I cant do this, I cant do this. I dont even know how to work those stupid machines.
What about them?
(curious) Bald? Uh?
What for?
Well at least you accomplished something. You got fish.
I still have brill cream.
Now, listen closely. I was at the unemployment office and I told them that I was very close to getting a job with Vandelay Industries and I gave them your phone number. So, when now when the phone rings you've got to answer "Vandelay Industries".
(internally) How am I gonna get out of this? Think Costanza, think!
(OC) It's George.
(attacking Kramer) How could you give me a defective condom?!
Hi (raises his left hand in a slight gesture to say hi)
The woman we bought the wheelchair for?
They're men with jobs, Jerry! They wear suits and ties. They're married, they have secretaries.
I don't like when a woman says, 'Make love to me', it's intimidating. The last time a woman said that to me, I wound up apologizing to her.
Do ya?
You
Is that the guy who likes fat women?
(irascible) Oh, I see. So your time is more valuable than mine. Is that it? You're a delicate genius!
I'd argue if I could, Mrs. Enright. (exits) Here we go, all right.
Well, as I say, the pink-eye made my vision...quite blurry... (Joe's daughter comes to the door.)
Muffin, sandwich and coffee!
What are you up to now, uh, Step Nine?
Let me tell you something. No one walks into a beauty parlor and says "Give me the Larry Fine."
Drink your soda! Come on! I know you're there, laughing at me. Laughing and lying and laughing! I had to go to Reggies, Jerry! Reggies!
Because! Because, as the leader...if I die...then all hope is lost! Who would lead? The clown? Instead of castigating me, you should all be thanking me. What kind of a topsy-turvy world do we live in, where-where heroes are cast as villains? Brave men as cowards?
Hey, a "hit" is a totally different story.
What? Huh, so I had it all along. How d'you like that? (snorts) I guess I owe that cashier an apology.
(delighted) Jerry? It was incredible! Models! As far as the eye could see!
All right, let me just... I'm gonna grap an apple.
Let's go, people, let's go! It's Prognosis Negative time, wa ha ha ha!!!
And you're the shark?
Oh yeah, when are you gonna execute that plan?
Pudding skin singles.
Hey, I am not a prude sweetheart. I swing with the best of them. (snapping his fingers 5 times)
So Anyway, I started to compliment Elaine on her sketches and it turns out,they're Paula's.
"Double-dipped"? What are you talking about?
No I'm not. I *was* bald.
I can't go out there, he knows we're friends.
(Defensively) You can look at them, but do NOT touch them. (Holds them out)
Is that good?
Oh you told her didn't you.
Kramer, I cant believe it. Oh, youre my hero!
(grabbing the sweater back) Well it's not really damaged. 85 dollars huh?
(PULLING OUT ESTIMATE OUT OF HIS POCKET) Well, profit. I think you'll see from the estimate that I'm not really profiting that much. They might be a little high, but..
What do you mean?
I knew it!! (shuts cab door) I predicted it! (hits cab roof twice, it drives off) Saw both of them today! What a disaster! I'm runnin' all over Queens. First I saw my mother. We had lunch together. Never had... LUNCH with my mother before--it's like a date! Then we drive down to Kew Gardens! Tons of traffic! I see my father. We played "Clue"! All day with this! [Kew Gardens (see links at end of script)]
(frantic by now) SHUT UP,SHUT UP, SHUT UP,...(then leaves)
Carol, thats so rude. Please, Im serious, just for a moment, if you wouldnt mind. And then well talk to Jerry.
Not even close, huh?
Well, you're gonna have to go to the bathroom!
That's really very nice of you, Eva. Thank you.
Love to.
What happened? Where have you been?
(agitated) Alright, I gotta try and talk my mother into taking him off my hands.
All right, I want you to do me a favor.
Because if there's any doubt at all I...I feel we should cultivate it.
Say it's Saturday night in Spain. They go out dancing. You think they do the flamenco?
Well I don't want to get into a big dispute about the pants.
Hey, Cosmo what happened to your mother last night. She hung me out to dry.
Thats so brutal, I hate that.
Let Maria Shriver give her a baby shower.
I had no idea.
Yes, sir. Yes sir, do my best.
Maybe it's some small thing I could change. Like a moustache. Or wearing a top hat, or a monocle, or a..or a cane.
I told you.
I'm sure we're all aware of the flaws and biases of standardized tests..
(reluctant) Oh that uh, that seems like a lotta trouble.
Yes, I have a problem with paba.
(happily) Difficult?
I told I had a bus transfer that was only good just for another hour.
I know. Completely bonkers!
Yes, it is consistent. I've, uh, I've tried to maintain a consistent feel throughout the house.
That was no good?
(Hands still out, even though they've stopped looking at them) What happened to him?
Something like that.
Right.
It's open!
You what?
I would? What if something happens?
Yeah, I told her how toilet paper hasn't changed in my lifetime, and probably wouldn't change in the next fifty thousand years and she was fascinated, fascinated!
It just came to me.
(to Jerry) Have you seen the waitresses in there lately? I never had so much coffee in my life.
It's a pot pourri. May I, uh, may I show you the master bedroom? (they leave together)
She stayed over?
You know, I have to tell you something. You couldn't get me on a plane right now. I get those FAA reports directly. My uncle sends them to me, he used to be a pilot, so. Big investigation in the, uh, what's the word there, uh, offing. It's in the offing. But, you know, you shouldn't let that stop you from going. You could go. I don't mind.
Oh, wait, isn't scalping illegal?
No no no no, you have to approach this as if he was a woman.
(Changing subject) Hey, I htink I may have found someone for the scholarship.
You can stuff your sorries in a sack, mister!
They can...
Wait a minute let me call Susan.
What, to see the old guy?
(To a passing waitress) I'll have some coffee and a doughnut.
So, what are you saying?
A garden! I cant believe theres a garden!
I dunno. I was just talking to the man and he walked out on me!
No.
It was on CNN ( Kramer comes in and he is taping from a Camcorder) This Chinese doctor Zeng Zau. has discovered a cure for baldness.
Seven!!
I was going to, but then I found out that the auto club has this free locksmith service, so I signed up. Just waiting for the membership to kick in.
MOOPS
I cant believe how easy it is. Im virtually Orthodox. All I have to do is read a few books, memorize a few prayers, and Im in the club.
Ahh! How'd she look?
Kramer?!
Yeah, when the season starts. Right now, I sit around pretending that I'm busy.
So, I could do that?
Did you here that? I can't believe this he's eating his sandwich.
You're friends with Marisa Tomei?
Well, sure Joey, sure, I would be thrilled.
Nothing!
(looking uncomfortable) Um... yeah! Sure, sure I'm interested.
Of course, I'm the result of my parents having stayed together, so you never know. (Russell comes out of the bathroom.)
Dont insult me, my friend. Remember who youre talking to. No ones a bigger idiot than me.
You did all this...for a pinky toe?
How was the show?
Would it kill him to check up on us? No - drops off the meals and that's it. I realize we're prisoners, but we're still entitled to catsup.
She said "sweep together" you idiots, not "sleep together."
Come on, lets go!
Hey.
Alrighty. Ah ... my last job was in publishing ... I uh got fired for having sex in my office with the cleaning woman.
(clearing his throat, he changes his order for Susan) Baked, uh, potato.
Really?
Well, I might be getting into that.
(animated) What're you talking about?! She's very concerned! She said she was gonna get it back.
Apparently the Seinfelds' are too good for us. I shouldn't say anything bad about your uh your partner.
No, that's not enough BTUs for my living room...That was a complete waste of time.
(Mocking, skeptic) Yeah, you show us the 900.
Wait, wait. Here me out. Don't dismiss this. You're very quick to dismiss. Don't dismiss. She's got a big crush on David Letterman, I mean, a big crush. She talks about him all the time. Suppose I go up to David Letterman. He works at NBC; I work at NBC. I explain my situation. He agrees to meet her. They go out, they fall madly in love. And she dumps me for David Letterman.
I just pray Kruger doesn't realize that it's gone until this guy can fix it up.
Alright, well why don't we smooth the head down to nothing, stick a pumpkin under its arm and change the nameplate to Ichabod Crane?
What red dot? What are you talking about? Jerry come here for a second. Do you see anything here?
The guy that stole my glasses. This time I got 'em! (George follows the man onto the street, dragging the blind man with him) Would you pick it up a little?
Oh, it's the chicken and the egg...
Hands a little smelly?
Hey, is that Tim Whatley?
Hey look a that - boy are you lucky - another great spot - right in front of the hospital. In an emergency yet! How lucky are you huh? Is that unbelievable? How unbelievable is that huh? Come on, give it to me, give it to me.
You want me to ask one of the Yankees.
Uh, I just went out, I went to look for my friend?
Cause its all in the greeting.
I don't even think she'd notice it. Can you see it?
(whispering) I can't explain. It's very important that I sit here.
No, Ill put half a can of mousse in my head like you.
(Sulking) That's why I hate it.
(interrupting) You know we should really order, the service is so slow here, by the time you get anything...
I-I don't know. Last time I got the tap.
They wanted to read a Truman Capote book.
Allow me. Why?
Hey, don't embarrass me today. I got some friends in the stands. (George makes a swinging motion with an imaginary bat and pulls something in his back.)
Hey, listen don't oversleep. You can't afford to be late again.
Yes, you know. Deal with it .We have to deal with the doubt, Susan The DOUBT!! Must be dealt with.
He gave me a wedgie.
(Let down) Yeah, but you - you promised it to me.
But you have a watch on.
You did that?
I went to the hardware store interview.
I'd like to be able to get it out.
I bent over backwards for that woman! Is it that thing I said about her sister?
Ah, excuse me. Do you have, uh, change of a dollar?
Hey. Hey. Answer me! Come on, show yourselves!
So I said, "Mr. Hayman, It's me george Costanza, JFK, ... " He doesn't move. So I said uh, "Can't stand ya'", "Can't stand ya'" He turns and smiles, the little baked bean teeth. I get up to run away, but something was holding me back. It was Heyman. He had my underwear. There I was on the steps of the 42nd St. library , a grown man, getting a wedgie.
Pawn shop?
Ah, Alright, before that, I was in real estate. I quit, because the boss wouldn't let me use his private bathroom. That was it.
Uh, no. No, we shouldn't.
No-no-no, Kramer. Kramer! Kramer! You *cannot* abandon people in the middle of an airport pickup! It's a binding social contract. We... we must go forward... not back.
What?
Yeah, that is odd, isn't it?
I said so many things.
And everything else has changed. But toilet paper is exactly the same, and will be so until we're dead.
How ya doing?
What? What are you talking about.
(frustrated) Not necessarily.
Ah, a, You know what, maybe I'll just come ... umm, yummm (stammering)
So go ahead pigeons. hu hu hu. Laugh it up. I'm getting in my car now and the last I heard ... we have NO DEAL!
Besides, what's it gonna cost me? Thirty-eight bucks?
No, you're not a divorcee. Youre just separated. You're---you're a separatee.
Water. Need some water! Water here!
Did I tell you?! Did I tell you?!
Really? That's pretty good.
Don't go. Kramer! Come back. I got great news. Well, I did it.
Is there a pinkish hue?
(Gets up, stopping him) Woah, woah, woah! What are you telling me for? You really had me going, there! C'mon, sit down. (They both sit back down) What do you want to do when you grow up?
Jerry did you wash this pear?
Ahoy! Mr. Eldridge. I understand you were on the Andrea Doria.
Yeah, yeah, sure, Christmas. Snow. Santa. All that stuff.
Just nice?
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. It's from that grapefruit that Jerry squirted at me.
Alright the administrator's on the third floor. I'll meet you guys back at the car.
(Puts nuts into his mouth, and in the process covers his mouth) We bring her to the party, and she can tell me what Gwen is saying about me.
It's a big flat noodle.
'Mickey'? (incredulous) 'Mickey'!
Yeah, I got one too.
Yeah. Yeah, one second.
Pounded?
So eh, you eh, wanna get together tomorrow?
I found it morose. Why dwell on these negative themes?
Heuh. huh. Stick around a while.
I'm sorry, umm he-here's your money back (gives Rudy the money back) I-I-I'll have the clothes.
I just got fired.
Hey uh let me take you're coat.
(slightly worried) You know, I'm starting to get a little nervous about this lunch.
What, do you pay him for that?
Well, it's this little place with this little bathroom. It's like right there, you know, it's not even down a little hall or off in an alcove. You understand? There's no... buffer zone. So, we start to fool around, and it's the first time, and it's early in the going. And I begin to perceive this impending... intestinal requirement, whose needs are going to surpass by great lengths anything in the sexual realm. So I know I'm gonna have to stop. And as this is happening I'm thinking, even if I can somehow manage to momentarily... extricate myself from the proceedings and relieve this unstoppable force, I know that that bathroom is not gonna provide me with the privacy that I know I'm going to need...
Why don't you think before you do something?
What if she becomes Miss America? You could be dating Miss America, Jerry!
(shouts) You be nice!
That's Kramer.
Do you think it would be better if I did?
Well, some women like it.
Well, what'd you think?
Uh, here.
Well, losing a loved is, uh...I mean, forget about it. (Starts wolfing down the sandwiches.)
No.
What? He's outside?
Did she say Hello?
Every time we go out to eat the minute we we're done eating she's runnin to the bathroom.
It's that bleak? (pours a glass of milk)
"BECAUSE IF HE CAN'T JUMP. THERE GOES MY SNEAKER BUSINESS!!"
*Really*.
"George would never do anything like that."
For what?
Did you ever see her lose her temper. I was once late cause I bought a Panama hat -- she grabbed it by the brim, pulled it down so hard my head came right through the top of it.
I got it. Cups in the front, loops in the back. (puts the bra on the table)
Oh right, right! The blue sweatpants! Gees, it's too bad you can't say anything because of Angela.
.........What's that?...
Alright, listen, I'll give you your spare keys, but I don't have them with me. Can I please have mine to give to back to Kramer?
So long, Mr. Farkus.
Oh yeah HA-A-A, HA-A-A.
You would not believe what just happened. I was waiting for you and this woman was sitting at the counter.
Let me tell you something about that tag. It's no 31, and uh...let's just leave it at that.
Take a guess.
Why do they have to do that in front of people?
What? Elaine's big-head guy? They have you the apartment?!
Sid, who's gonna move the cars while you're away?
Come on!
I do too. you see that's what we're about . You don't remind me of anyone and we love gum.
Uh, le - let's go do, something.
late June.
Yeah?
Alright, then. We've gotten to the bottom of that.
So in order to use these, I gotta spend like fifteen-hundred bucks. This is a bill for fifteen-hundred dollars. Plus, she'd ask about the sleeping arrangements, that whole sleeping arrangement conversation is depressing.
So, Elaine, are you going to sleep with me or what?!
Look, you wanna have sex right now? Do want to have sex with me right now? Let's go! C'mon, let's go baby! C'mon!
Oh, it was. But he claimed it was a 5th Avenue bar.
(explaining, with lots of hand gestures) Okay, look. We've never worked together on a lie. Now, you don't understand how I work. I have a certain way of working. Jerry and I have worked together a few times. He knows how I work. It's not a personal thing, y'know? We're just trying to come up with the best possible lie. That's what this is all about.
She knows there is nothing to talk about.
(modest) And I'm a little tired.
That's right. It's just me and her.
Alright, how's this? We wait till we get to your street corner, we see Elaine and Kramer then we get out. They can't shoot us in the city.
(shifty, avoiding Jerry's eyes) Fine, fine. (he removes his coat)
I got some cufflinks I could've loaned you.
Well there is traffic. It might take her till eight-fifteen.
(sitting) So, guess where Mr 'Ocean phoned' turned up? He's working for Firestone, in Akron, Ohio.
Nah, I'm good.
No, of course not...
Twenty-five percent? It was your idea.
Hey.
So?
I tell you something. I wish there were pig-men. You get a few of these pig-men walking around suddenly I'm looking a whole lot better. Then if somebody wants to fix me up at least they could say, "Hey he's no pig-man!"
You got your own shampoo, conditioner, body lotion! Jerry, body
Really?
Okay. A little.
I bet they're probably doing summersaults about us over there. You think they get butler stories like that everyday? (He calls Susan)
Maybe he was going to say "Of course I have to check with my associates."
Oh, yes of course, come in.
So I'm dressing and she's staring up at me, struggling to compute this unprecedented turn of events. I don't know what to say to reassure this woman, and worst of all, I don't have the time to say it. The only excuse she might possibly have accepted is if I told her I am in reality Batman, and I'm very sorry, I just saw the Bat-Signal. It took me 3 days of phone calls to get her to agree to see me again. Now she's waiting for me to call her, and she's
Dad, that other car cut us off! They had swastikas all over it... They were hurling racial epiphates at us... I could have been killed!
Oh, no no no no. Go ahead, Pop, you always knew your cars.
No, no, pff...
Who cares about eyebrows? Is she sweet? I like sweet. But not too sweet, you could throw up from that.
No.
What?
"Hey"
Why? Is there anything wrong?
She says we cant go out anymore.
Oh really. You tell her you shaved it?
I cheated in the contest.
Out? Oh no, I've been to four other places, you're the only ones that have had it.
Id like to have a kid. Of course, you have to have a date first... Remember my friend, Adam, from Detroit?
So you could call a woman for a date, ask her if she's free for Dinner and a flamenco?
Yeah?
Just dropped in for a visit. You, uh, you never called me back.
The guy who pitched him the show with the stories about nothing. (snaps fingers) Jerry Seinfeld. Jerry Seinfeld's friend.
You already told me everything.
I want you to find out is she likes me.
Yeah. (Points to two open seats in front of Jerry's. To Nina) Sit down there. (Sees Jerry in the crowd) Hello, Jerry. (Obviously angered at Jerry) I believe you know Nina.
I am aware. I am aware.
(back-pedalling) No, he, he didnt actually tell me that, uh, we were talking about that commercial  in fact I think I brought it up because I like that commercial. No, he, he would never tell me anything. He never discusses anything. Hes, hes like a clam. Youre not gonna mention this, to him...
(angry shout) So am I!
What's so hard about that? How am I supposed to get it in there? I can't just walk in with it. I have to get the Rosses out of the apartment!
Hey.
Let me be the architect! I can do it!
Cosmo?
(to Jerry) Well, what d'you think?
You can't - huhu, All right let's go.
Yeah, it bothers me. Doesn't it bother you?
Yeah. (clears his throat) We should do this again.
Is that common in our family?
Hey, theres Kramer & Darren.
Signal? What signal?
The government is very touchy about us being in the air. Let us run around on the ground as much as we want. Anything in the air is a big production.
How much do you tip a chamber maid?
Yeah well, we don't think.
S-s-somebody double parked, we couldn't help it. It might have been Saddam Hussein, we're not really sure. He eh, had a British accent though.
You got the Yankee envelope?
Yeah, good luck. Hey I'll meet you outside.
Oh, she didn't think it was funny. What is she, Rowan & Martin? We're supposed to meet with NBC tomorrow! She completely shattered my confidence. And I'm paying for this, she's my employee!
(Annoyed) There's more.
It's George.
For vomiting on her vest!
I know I gave it to you.
Oh my God.
What? Really?
Can you believe he sold his glasses on the street?
Well, it's not my fault. You poked me!
Jerry, where y'going? It's... what're...
One little wink. She'll freak out, tell my parents. They'll be all over me. Who is this guy?
You know you buy a big salad for somebody it would be nice if they knew it.
I'm not* sure.
You can't break up with me. I've got hand.
It's like I'm Neil Armstrong. I turn around for a sip of Tang and you jump out first.
(banging the recorder) Stop it! Stop it!
Yeah. yeah. I-I know.
This is not about them. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to exercise Jerry's gaskets.
(Stern) No, ma, I'm not gonna see a psychiatrist. N- I don't care if you do pay for it! No! Discussion over. Yeah, alright, I'll see you later. Yes, of course I'm gonna come by. Alright. (Hangs up, slamming it down on the coffee table. He sits down next to Jerry) My mother wants me to see a psychiatrist now. Why?! Because she caught me? (Scoffs, shaking his head) You know, if everyone who did that had to go see a psychiatrist.. (Laughing, he snorts)
It's all worked out. Nina and I will have dinner Thursday at the restaurant where Babs works.
Jerry, let me tell you something, "A man without hand is not a man." I got so much hand I'm coming out of my gloves. I got to thank Kramer.
Ladies. I, uh, I haven't seen this before.
Huckleberry, Raspberry...
(ahem) In this age of uncertainty and confusion, a man begins to ask himself certain questions. How can one even begin to put into words something so um (trying to think of a word)
Yea they're making Paella.
Absolutely, uh, lets see there's, uh, Vandelay Industries, I just saw them. I got very close there. very close.
Yes.
Is there any work being done? Is there any rubbing, touching, finger manipulation on the other person, and if so, who's making the request?
Three pints of Kramer's blood?
Hello.
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I used to come here all the time with my fiance, back when it was a meat-packing plant. Ha. Here's her picture. (hands her a magazine page)
Why?
Then, the last person to leave is Wilhelm. He sees my car, he figures I'm burning the midnight oil. Between the two of them, they think I'm working an 18 hour day! (he stands there with his hands on his hips, a wide grin - laughing.)
Cause its signals, Jerry, its signals! (snapping his fingers) Dont you- all right. Did she even ask you, what you were doin tomorrow night, if you were busy?
Maura. (starts acting dramatically, looking from Maura to Loretta and back again) Oh, my God! What are you doing here?!
What do you think I said?
Sweet guy (Receives the phone from Beth, Starts to talk to Jerry) Hello
(hearing Jerry broke up with Patty) Are you still down in the dumps? Come on. It's just a chick.
Okay.
Yeahaha, I gave it a shot (pats Jerry on the arm)... So, any word on the "artiste"? (puts a video in the VCR)
I can't believe you're not playing in cotton.
You start flirting with him and I'll come by and, while you're keeping him busy, I'll slip it in his drink.
All right, all right. Thats it. Im gonna go down there.
I wanna know what I did to this woman.
Shocked?
I'm not giving you the satisfaction. I'm gonna watch it again...
I'm the one he wants! He's coming to settle the score.
Mr. Thomassoulo during times of great stress, people are capable of super human strength. Have you ever seen the Incredible Hulk, sir?
No. That's not that.
Smile
No, you're crushing my sandwich.
Youre doomed. Youre gonna have to have all your sex at womens apartments. Itll be like a permanent road trip. Forget about the home bed advantage.
I didn't take it, yet.
Hand modeling? (Shakes his head 'No')
No doors?
Cops. I don't even care about cops. I wanna see more garbage men. It's much more important. All I wanna see are garbage trucks, garbage cans and garbage men. You're never gonna stop crime, we should at least be clean.
Who do I like? I, like, uh, Art, Vandelay.
Was this something you had planned for a while?
Hey I get a free trip to Paris, I go in the Big Brother's Hall-of-Fame, I mail my own postcards.
We could build a cabin like (Snaps) that.
What *kind* of a person are you?
How could it still smell after all that?
Remember, dont take any crap.
Oh, hello, it's you! (angry) Listen lady, I got six minutes left on that meter, and I'm not budging til you admit you stole my twenty dollars. (smug) Huh-hu-hur, you're not so tough when you're not on your horse, are you Ruthie?
I know....
Really?
Yeah, (cough) Definite smoke.
That's what I want.
There could be more than one O'Brien on a plane who ordered a limo.
if you hadn't come, this whole thing wouldn't have happen (back on Jerry and Elaine's side, we can hear George saying "I was the one who was invited", Jerry opens the door)
It's an early Christmas present.
(quietly) ahh.
What the hell happened to your shirt?
Call the Embassy.
What?
(Sarcastic) Yeah, yeah. I'm gonna move in with him. He doesn't even let you use the toilet!
Big hefty stinking faux pas.
My whole life is ruined because of the (Mocking, bitter tone) "puffy shirt".
I- I'm pretty sure I left it eh, behind the cushion of the chair ... accidentally.
You are ruinin' everything.
This thing can't hurt me, can it? I mean, it is a laser. What if it hits my eye?
What trip? You were gone?
(Confused) Flagged?
Well, I was 14 years old. I was in my friends bathroom. His mother's brassieres were hanging on the shower rod and I picked it up, studied it. I thought, I like this. I didn't know what way or what level, but I knew I wanted to be around brassieres.
hu, Coffee. Too much coffee (nervous laughter).
Muy sumpatico. Muy muy muy.
Right, can we go? Cause Im double-parked, Im gonna get a ticket.
That's not funny. So, are you coming to the party?
Wait a minute, wait, it's not that stupid.
Alleluia.
Jerry, what do you, you wanna, you wanna see the place or not?
That's true, that always happens to me.
Do you feel funny? He didn't say anything.
And the underwater bubble cities?
Ya!
Oh, uh, the cigars.. (Chuckles nervously) I'm, uh, suckin' 'em down. I'm puffing my brains out, yeah.
I guess that leaves me in the clear...
Well what do you eat?
I'll tell you something, if I'd own a company, my employees would love me. They'd have huge pictures of me up on the walls and in their home, like Lenin.
It's about nothing.
The Friars Club?
Thanks, Warden.
Would you take her out?
You know what I think? I bet she stole a tractor.
Oh my!
Boom!
I'm very attracted to you..
Because ballpark food doesn't count as real food.
So what, he's got a couple of good jokes.
I wonder what toilet paper was loike in the 1860's. Did they carry it in rolls in their duffle bags?
(Nods) Uh-huh.
God.
How do you kn ow?
Kramer goes to a fantasy camp. His whole life is a fantasy camp. People should plunk down two-thousand dollars to live like him for a week. Do nothing, fall ass-backwards into money, mooch food off your neighbors and have sex without dating; that's a fantasy camp.
No, I don't know who was doing that.
Not bills.
What do I do? Well actually, I'm a writer. In fact, I'm writing a comedy pilot for NBC right now.
Yeah, what the hell?!
(surprised) So, I'm Neil? How did I do that?
A tractor.
You don't tell him?
Come on, wanna give me a hand with the computers?
So, if I may jump ahead - you're gonna take dog medicine?
Hid? I have no idea how this suit got misplaced. Nevertheless, I do believe I shall purchase it.
Really?
Hey.
(Makes a gesture saying he understands. The man nods) But how.. uh..?
Yeah, like that.
Friars.
It's all politics.
Yeah, yeah, yeah we could. You know, ah, Kramer, the next time you talk to her, find out if she knows Kelly, from Monk's. I wanna know if she really has a boyfriend.
Jerry, can I talk to you for a second? (They enter Jerry's apartment)
"Aahhrgh...it wouldn't take...... long pause, audience laughter) ten minutes from now, I'll be sweating all over again ,I can feel it. I'm a human heat pump!"
I cant call her now. Its too soon. Im planning a Wednesday call.
Yeah, I wish.
What TV Guide?
She's a virgin?
You don't remember me?
Oh yeah.
He just walked away! And once again I'm standing here like a little man. Well not this time! (George leaves the store and follows the dog owner) You! Dog man!
No.
"It doesn't help"
So what did she say?
I'm not really sure, I...
"step off"?
(shouting) What happened to Soda?! I thought we all agreed on Soda.
Ohhhh...
You dont like tippy toe?
It's complicated.
Or, I could take the twenty, then I could pay *you* later.
(impatient) What about Marisa Tomei?!
I gotta go zoo. I feel like I could set more of my own schedule.
(getting up and leaving) Alright! That's it for me. Goodnight everybody.
Oh no, thank you.
Yes! I see enormous potential here.
Shall we say an hour.
Oh, you're in here.
It means a non-Jewish woman.
A what?
Shoplifting.
(To guard) Tired?
Alright, alright, but no funny business, same deal as last night.
Why not?
I'm sure he'll be back in a second.
It's in Detroit though, it's an expensive flight.
Hmm-hmm, not by a long shot. I'm calling up the Rosses and inviting them up to my non-existent place in the Hamptons. Then we'll see who blinks first.
What do you mean you will? That's a bad idea. Jerry is a very private person.
(bewildered) Heh heh.
(Sarcastically) What's the competition, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang?
I don't want it to feel good.
Yes! How're we gonna do that?
You mean she just laid there topless?
Yeah, listen, I can't make it later.
She put them in her pocketbook. I guess she took them with her.
I still don't see why I can't ask her about my arm.
(frantic) Jerry! Jerry, muh--muh--my hair-dryer ruined the picture! An' I need another one or I can't get back into the forbidden city!
No it's not, it's the ticket-<buyers> line.
Yeah, six weeks.
Why don't you just call 911?
Thanks again for last night!
You know, the time..
Well, well, I had a dream, Jerry.
China.
There's no chance of that.
I dont know. But he aint funny.
Pennypacker. Varnsen.
Because it's really a pretty good little story. Don't you think?
here Elaine here, Superman (hands a comic book to Elaine, who passes it to Tony) please, next time it will only be the two of us
Did you see what just happened?
So, maybe this should be it.
What do you mean Wednesday? I though we had tickets to the Knick game Wednesday. We got seats behind the bench! What happened? Were not going?
Yeah.
What?
Nowhere.
Why?
What side?
Excuse me, do you have a ticket?
So, they go off for the ride, by the time they come back the bread is there.
I said, would you like to go for a walk or something.
I learned a lot about myself.
So, how was the trip?
First she screams, "George, what are you doing?! My God!" And it looked like she was gonna faint - she started clutching the wall, trying to hang onto it.
I really think I should have been consulted about this.
No, its not a problem, I can get rid of the apartment this afternoon.
MOOPS
He's right. never.
Where?
Oh, well I didn't know you went into Queens Jerry.
No, no, the machine'll get it...
Yeah, sure.
Yeah.
How do you know?
You don't know where we parked?
Pauline? . . . Wait a minute. I got it. My brother once impregnated a woman named Pauline.
Oh yes I am Father. Incredibly sincere. So, uh, pffft, am I in?
All right, all right, two fifty.
hitting phone
What is this? This is a drawing.
I've been doing a lot of thinking. This might be my chance to start giving something back.
Oh, well, I'm sure you can reach her...she's a poet. What does a poet need an unlisted number for?
I mean we can put a man on the moon but we're still basically very stupid. The guy who's car this is? He could be one of the guys that built the rocket. You see what I'm saying?
Where are you!
Exactly.
You know what you oughta do. You should go to her office and heckle her.
Yes?
(smiles) Beats the hell out of coffee.
Whew! Boy, it's cold outside, huh? Oh, these New York winters, huh. Bitter cold, bitter.
How do you know?
Wow! I didn't try that 'til I was 23.
What time is it?
Morgan? No. He's doing a great job. (winks)
Yeah, he's right.
Hi ah, My name is George.
Whatever.
I was there! I saw a drain!
Excuse me...huh... I think I made a big mistake. I'd like my deposit back please.
Im sorry, I dont see the big deal about being a matador. The bull charges, you move the cape, whats so hard?
Phil, I loved those cigars! Incoming! (Flicks his card tward Phil)
Oh. That's good.
So, what? We're gonna do nothing now, this is crazy.
Eh, I can't. I gotta go down to the foundation. I'm interviewing high schoolers for the Susan Ross.. scholarship.
I said, do you like ice?
Oh, oh!
(examining reflection) I really think this looks pretty good.
You don't think I can keep a secret?
Something, nothing, I could care less.
Blackberry, Boysenberry ...
And she loved me. Hoo, ho, she really did.
Oh, uh, just a friend of mine.
(shouting) Turn your key, Maura. Turn your key!
Wha, that's a Kinney lot?
Whaddya mean, you'll ``get'' the popcorn and the soda?
You're Murphy!
Nine minutes.
Alright, alright, fine. (Gives the keys to Elaine.)
Yeah! That's how they talk. You know, everyone's either a bastard or a son of a bitch. Yeah, it's like uh..."boy, that son of a bitch Box can really hit, uh?!" (laughs)
All right (he smiles weakly at Maura)
So you thought she was good looking and figured this would be a good way to meet her.
What the hell is going on here?
What?
Well she was sending out our wedding invitations.
Im an architect.
Really?
(walking back) Are you sure? 'Cause it could really help me out of a jam.
Yes. You know the uh flood, and the uh lepers, and the commandments and all that.
No, Newman, stop it.
Well, I took the liberty of packing your things. (gleeful) Mom's coming to get you.
I hear thee.
Elaine, when a woman makes a Ball Entrance.. she twirls.
Wait, as a matter of fact, wasn't there some guy in your building that you said you liked? He lived up on the fifth floor or something.
You know, a muffin can be very filling.
There ya go.
I think it moved. Oh my god, I think it moved. Yeah, give me the big piece. I'll see you later.
I think you're right. You gonna eat that?
(little worried) Coffee? (thinks) I can beat that. Move in with me.
With Candace Bergen!
I don't know, I don't know, you'll think of something.
Kramer, what's the name of the store with the mannequin?
Well I can't break up with her now.
Behind the dugout, are you kidding? How did you get them?
I've got some plans. I got plans.
Ow! .. Ow! I give, I give! Uncle!
(angry undertone) Oh, I'm gonna give you a Royal bearing. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Lemme get a pack of gum here.
My little man's an idiot.
Fine. Steal the battery. Now, all right, here is the Frogger. This is the front door, and this is the outlet.
How do you know?
What about me? I was a total failure. Everything was fine. Now this thing's gonna be a success and God's gonna give me a terminal disease.
Was there any nostril penetration?
What?
Yes!
(surprise) Head of scouting?
God! She's cooking dinner for God! She's yelling and screaming, and the next thing I know, she throws a big can of chocolate syrup all over my new red shirt.
"Jerry", oh my God. He wants to talk about "Jerry"?
When I was ten years old, my parents had this very same statue on the mantle of our apartment. Exactly. And, one day, I grabbed it, and I was using it as a microphone. I was singing, MacArthur Park, and I got to the part about, Ill never have that recipe again, and it slipped out of my hand and it broke. My parents looked at me like I smashed the ten commandments. To this day, they bring it up. It was the single most damaging experience in my life, aside from seeing my father naked.
She must have slipped it in here.
I like, uh...(mutters something unintelligible under his breath.)
(Muttering) No, that's it.
Well I spoke to Elaine...
Uh, nothing. I got to go.
What, you are comparing me to Biff Loman, very encouraging. The biggest loser in history of American literature.
Roll up your sleeve.
Brother Costanza will be taking the vow of silence.
Yeah.
But I was thinking...T-bone.
This woman drove us out of our minds
Why not?
Perhaps. (hehe) I walk in, everything is organized -- messages, appointments. And I can't tell you how proud I am of myself for going with Ade.
I just don't like the idea that any time theres a dinner invitation there's this annoying little chore that goes along with it.
Excuse me?
All right.........I've become attracted to Elaine..
(Trying to be modest) Ah, come on..
So I really liked the pictures I picked up here yesterday.
That's amazing.
(wondering) Maybe he doesn't. Maybe he and I are exactly the same, except for one minor, yet crucial, detail. You never know.
Great move, telling him, by the way, real smart move.
Ah, Just double park.
Yeah, like he was really gonna take your money.
Where's the sunblock?
How does Tim Whatley even know Newman?
I had to say something. (chuckles) I had to say something. Everything was going so well. I had to say something.
Flying him in? How longs he staying for?
It just does.
I like to get the Daily News!
Hi.
I just don't feel like it anymore.
You took me to one of your shows..
Susan's college roommate.
Up again?! This is incredible! Im.. Im getting it.
Brown.
So where are you staying?
Well, you gotta do it.
Get outta here..
Oh, here we go...
Oh, thank you.
[furious] Good. It's good to be accurate like that.
I don't understand women.
Did you feel that tension? We use to have banter - (puts menu back with frustration) - there's no more banter.
Sir, I just got a call from the terrorist. I told him to call back here.
I'm very nervous about this. I've never spoken to a mental patient before.
Yes. Live, dammit. Live! Every precious moment as if this was the last year of your life. Because in many ways...it is. (There's a knock at the door.) Excuse me.
yeah, Kramer, we're, uh, kind of in the middle of something here. We're trying to do a little work..
Almost. Couldn't get the girl go out with me the second time.
Hah.
Allison bought it for me.
Ade you are incredible
Once, to a dog. He licked himself and left the room.
(puzzled) W-we're not?
Aaaa (looking around for Jerry) aaaa (finds Jerry) Ah ha. They had plans huh? They were busy. They were busy with their (doing a little dance to make the plans seem all that important) big plans!
No but say hello for me.
No! My ticket?! You gave my ticket to Horneck?
So, anyway, what's uh, what's the status with, uh...
Ask her about Kramer.
He's got Marlon Brando's. I could go to Marlon Brando's house if I really wanted.
Well, I'm satisfied. Uh...my back is...killing me.
A scar?
Heads!
Not with that big glass window looking out into the hall. I'd love a good nap. That's the only thing getting me out of bed in the morning. I'll see ya'.
I noticed you eh, chose the eh "clowns with balloons" check design.
Ha, I don't know who she's looking for. I don't know. I'll tell you something. She's very particular, your daughter. Very particular. What is she looking for some big hot shot businessman? Well I've got my pride too. I'm not going to beg her.
How could he not have washed?
Hey, Kramer, where are you going?
Of course you do... It's just, uh, y'know, I-I never *knew*, uh, that, uh...
Geez, Hey you know something, you should try my friend's wake up service. She swears by this thing.
I gotta call Tatiana. where's the phone?
What if she discusses it with Jane?
SEVEN AND FIVE EIGHTHS!!
Right here. (showing his lip)
Oh, hi...
No, occasionally I'll forget to let the machine pick up. Anyway, they made this large donation, to a women's prison, and I get to go down there and check it out.
Yeah.
Alright, still her father didn't have to throw me out like that, he could have just asked me to leave. The guy had me in a headlock! Susan's not going tonight you know.
Soooooo
Huh, strawberries, anyone? (eats a strawberry) Ah, that's good. Ooh, juicy this time of year.
Hey, who's talking to you?
Another job?
(shouting) I'm not looking for another line. I got the line.
How so?
(Asking Elaine) Jerry seem a little weird when I mentioned Nina?
(again from bathroom) Witness.
No, Jerry, don't call.
No, of course not. I didnt-
We talked about his new batting stance, you know, I'm not crazy about it, but I said , 'Donny, go with it 'till it stops workin'.' Donny baseball. He's a helluva guy.
Yeah, now I gotcha! (hangs up the phone and rushes out the door)
We should have left earlier. I told you.
No, Seven.
No. We're supposed to tell him tonight.
So you really understand my point about building a rocket and double-parking.
I know. I know.
I had 'em, Jerry. They loved me.
Well, you know, I've been lyin' about my income for a few years. I figured I could afford a fake house in the Hamptons.
(Picking up the ketchup) What typical? Gimme typical. Gimme some typical.
Yeah. Yes! I just haven't seen you in a long time.
Oh, it had to happen!!
Sure. So, uh, Jerry, there's an empty apartment in my building. If you and Hallie want, we could try and hold it, may...
I bet they have more money than mine.
All right! Come on! Let's not fight.
Hey - What's going on?
...especially a girl. Or a boy.
You're right. Why must there always be a problem? You'd think just once I could get a break. God knows I earned it with that score!
(to Jay) What do you think it is?
Well, there's going to be a lot of dentists there.
A billiard parlor?
I couldn't have breakfast, it was lunchtime! The three hour time difference threw me. I wanted a tuna fish sandwich, they wouldn't serve me tuna fish sandwich, because they were only serving breakfast.
You don't trust my poker face?
I mean, big would even be ok, a little beyond big.
(smitten) Audrey? My god, you look incredible! I can't believe it!
(Anyway,) on the left--exquisite marble! High ceilings. An' a flush, like a jet engine! (imitates sound) Ha ha!
Sons of bitches!
Ya and also I'm afraid that people in that state are finally going to tell me what they really think of me. You know they got nothing to lose what do they care?
$2? But everyone in front of me got free bread.
Nah, I gotta deliver some Christmas presents to my parents.
Wait a minute, please--
Yeah, much better. All right, so what's the move, because I need *something*. This woman I'm dating, it's like she's doing her nails during love-making.
"Why would George steal from the Yankees?"
Because of society, right?
Oh, Safire. Uh ha
I know. That's the point. If it's gonna get sexual, it should get sexual with you.
So? What'm I gonna do?
Yeeeaaah. (Jerry and George lean in to make their conversation a little more private) Well..... I've never really felt confident in uh..... one particular aspect.
La-la Land. I got the window seat, right?
Yeah, the tenant association has decided to hear my side of the story. So, uh, I gotta kinda get ready. I'll see ya.
Bender? He cant play left. He stinks. I just dont see what purpose is it gonna serve your going? I mean, you think dead peole care whos at their funeral? They dont even know theyre having a funeral. Its not like shes hanging out in the back going, I cant believe Jerry didnt show up.
Hate those couples. I could never bee one of those couples. There are no bald woman around. You know?
Hey. You ready?
In college, maybe. Those were fun times.
Shhh! Listen, you gotta do me a favor. Give me your wallet. I'll give it back to you later.
Make-up sex? You have to have that right after the fight, we're way past that.
Oh my god he's not kidding. (exhale gasp)
Yeah, yeah, me to miss -- I miss.
It's a foreign movie... a *film*, is what it is, actually.
I can't tell ya how much I appreciate this.
Me either.
Hey, Mr Seinfeld. (shakes Morty's hand) Hey, Mrs Seinfeld. How are you?
(Nervous, his voice cracks) Hey, Antonio. How's it going?
Of course I do.
Does she walk around holding a pen she never seems to need?
Im not?
Yeah, he's something, isn't he?
Oh, Hey, eh, there's a spot right in front of the liquor store. You see
'Stanky Hanke'? What did he want?
(Pause) Yeah.
You see if I stay the whole year, I get it all.
Why don't you find a doctor that doesn't know your difficult.
We're on the Grand Central, there's no traffic.
Let me tell you who did, uh, buy it...um we pitched this story to Russell Dalrymple, the president of NBC, and he ate it up with a spoon.
I know they're in there, the three of them, laughing at me. Together, laughing and lying.
Yeah, I'm gonna get a paper.
My moneys all tied up in change right now.
What are we gonna tell her?
What?
And you automatically sleep with her?
Uh, about two hundred dollars, Miss DeMooney.
Mr. Morgan! Did you hear that? Mr. Morgan!
Kramer, this is perfect. I need you to go in there, pretend you're a doctor and check this guy for moles.
I thought tomorrow maybe we'd try a little corn beef.
You were supposed to deliver my calzones. We had a deal!
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. What about the pact?
Well, all vacations have to end eventually.
All right, so what's the penalty here? Let's just pay the fine or something and get the hell out of here.
Clothes shopping.
Susan, why?
(Losing it) Funny guy!
Believe me, I am not crazy.
Hey, I'm his nephew, all right? Don't worry about it. Go ahead. Check it out.
I'll tell you what, if pig-man shows up, we'll squeeze him in. I'll see you later.
What?
Yeah, I'm a great quitter. It's one of the few things I do well. I come form a long line of quitters. My father was a quitter, my grandfather was a quitter... I was raised to give up.
Well, what is it?
I know. I know. That's what I do. That's what I do.
Get out!! (Jerry gets out and George drives away. A couple of guys notice Jerry in his cowboy boots.)
(pleading) Alright..
I kept looking at her face. Id go, Cmon, love her. Love her!
Ow!
Why not?
Will you shut up?!
There's no G-bone.
It's a cleaning.
Hey, hey, hey! Whats goin on here? (To Jerry) You didnt agree to anything, did ya?
Yeah, just like I do.
Oh, no. We left on good terms.
Yeah, it's me, I just got home.
Huh-ho! Oh! You are too much, Mr. Kruger! Too much!
Just for these sponges?
Yes, good for me!
(confessing) Well, actually, I thought it up on the way over here.
I think it's "on the wagon".
Did she say anything about, uh...
Well, at the Yankees it was all about smoothing things over, you know, chiseling away, grinding down. In fact we used to call it 'the grind'.
No-no-no, we all chipped in. We have the money.
Yes, yes of course. The Pensky file. Ho ho, can't wait to sink my teeth into that. Wow that Pensky. Well we'll straighten him out.
Oh, nothing much. You know, I went over to Jerry's. Talked to Jerry. Um, could I talk to you for a minute?
(on tape, lifeless) Hey, it's George. I got nothin' to say... (beep)
Hey, you gotta take a ride with me later. I borrowed my father's car. '68 GTO.
I thought I saw him look in the mirror suspiciously.
Cross the wires? I can't even make a pot of spaghetti.
What for?
You have any idea how fast these things deteriorate when there's an 'I love you' out of the bag? You can't have a relationship where one person says, "I love you", and the other says, "I'm hungry. Let's get something to eat.".
I was trying to loosen 'em up a little bit.
WAIT ,WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!!!!.... Where was the tape recorder?
Peterman? Nobody mentioned anything about Peterman.
Because? Because?
Aw c'mon, I'm eating here.
ho ho ho ho. You know I only got two weeks left of unemployment. I got to prove I've been looking for a job to get an extension
Yeah, it's the last one.
Yo, dad. This is my boss, Mr. Kruger.
Anyway it's kind of a fluke thing but uh I'll be leaving for Paris in two days. I will send you a postcard when I get there.
Like a "Hey your mother is uglier than Hazel. Hazel really puts your mother to shame"
(Sitting on the sofa) I'm on no sleep, bro.
I eh, I had a sandwich in my pocket.
What about this--
(Annoyed) Yeah, yeah. We'll, uh, let you know.
They should call it round tine. You know what I'm talking about.
Your lawyer wears a cape...?
It's George
It's George.
Hey believe me, baldness will catch on. When the aliens come, who do you think they're gonna relate to? Who do you think is going to be the first ones getting a tour of the ship?
Maybe the baby would like to see my spot. A positive, uplifting message to start his life out with. Huh, You can still get a great space in this city - if you apply yourself.
One of the guys in my cell threw a piece of gum at him.
No, I'm a friend of Elaine Benes.
Oh yeah, you were right. She's gorgeous.
Excuse me. I believe you just ate my Twix bar. It was dangling. And when you purchased your Twix bar, you got a little freebie, and you never bothered to ask why, or seek out its rightful owner.
Yeah, she's quite a character.
She's not there. She left. She must've waited and left because those people wouldn't get off the phone.
(Uncapping his pen) Alright, here we go.
Yep. Classic horseshoe pattern. I've seen a lot of this.
You see this is the thing. . . . (crying) I just feel . . . mumble, cry, mumble, . . . I'm scared. You and I together, (cry)
Yeah, yeah. You must have squirted a piece of pulp in it too.
But I'm backing in! You can't put it in head first!
Oh, art!
Its fabulous.
"Breakfast At Tiffany's." 90 pages. (Waves a hand like it's nothing.)
Yeah, "duty". Do you know how much duty is?
Oh. (he stands there)
She happens to be very good friends with her.
Whe ... Well yeah!
(whispering angrily) Okay. Okay. Fine.
Its been a long night. You go home and get some sleep.
I tought I picked up a little something. I'm very good at this. Did you pick up anything?
What a bald paradise that must have been. Nobody knew.
Grateful? How can you be grateful when you're *so* close to the end? When you know that any second-- Poof! Bamm-O! It can all be over. I mean you're not stupid, you can read the handwriting on the wall. It's a matter of simple arithmetic, for Gods sake...
(excited) You're saying I stand to inherit three hundred thousand dollars, is that what you're saying?!
You only think that because you know me.
Radiating waves of pain..
And I am not a piece of toast.
Yeah. Good weekend.
Celia's up for parole.
We haven't heard his notes yet, we don't know how he feels about our work. (Russell throws up yet again.)
(pause) Dad! I heard you were in the city the other day!
I don't know, uh...
(Leaving) I'll store these over at Kramer's apartment.
(to Jerry) "You know those shoes that Jimmy had? I cut a deal with him. We're gonna import a case of them together."
So Dad,--
Ma?!
Oh.
I'm just asking, all they have to do is say no.
Oh sure, sure. You wanna be alone, sure. I understand that, you wanna a little time to think uh thing..ponder things..you know..ruminant..(chuckles) you go ahead, lotta stuff on your mind..you think things out..Think, mull, mull, do a lot of mulling. (short laugh then exits Monk's)
No, no, no. Just lately, I've been thinking a lot clearer. Like this afternoon, (To television) what is chicken Kiev, (Back to Jerry) I really enjoyed watching a documentary with Louise.
Isn't polite to say Hello when somebody says hello?
Oh yeeah.. well , Big smoker... I (coughs some more) gave it up for a while but it was too tough. Y' know.....I got no will power.
I have nothing to say to anybody. I'm so uninteresting. I think I'm out of conversation.
No, I got my own place.
'My wife's in a coma.' Yeah? Well, the life support machine called and...
We're not dead.
(frustrated) Ohh, I wanted to see that. (waves his arms in frustration) Thanks. Thanks a lot.
(startled) Oh!
Oh, no, not just me, the whole organization. Especially Mr. Morgan.
There is no problem. . . just a small miscommunication. Whereby you thanked her instead of the person actually responsible for purchasing the big salad.
He knows this guy, Wilkinson. He made a fortune in the stock market. Now hes got some new thing. You know, theres supposed to be a big merger. He wasnt even supposed to say anything. You guys should think about doing this too.
And so, for all these reasons, we are officially broken up. (shuts book and reaches for door) Thank you, (opens door) and good night.
I never should have brought her up there. Should have known better. Should have seen it coming. I didn't see it coming.
Das kaffes un salat e grand por favor.
I dont get art.
Jody's nice.
Who said that?
Ill tell her I bumped into you, Im giving you a ride uptown.
Whoa! Whoa! Geez!
We get to go to the opera together!
Hey Joey, how you doin'?
he..he's alive
I told them I have a place in the Hamptons. What did you say?
I got a hotel room.
(grunting) Hey! Hey, wait a second. I got an idea.
We had an incredible phone conversation. We talked for like twenty minutes. I threw away my notes in the middle of the call. You know, I thought she had a great voice timbre. Is it timbre or tamber?
Yes. The legends are true.
Yeah. The *original*.
That's it? You don't have to screw it in or anything?
What?
(animated) N..no, no. You can't leave me. (frantic) Marry me! I'll burn myself. I'll burn my parents!
What about the Coast Guard? Seems like a lot of pride there, a lot of tradition.
Youre a back-up, youre a second-line, a just-in-case, a B-plan, a contingency!
You know what this has to do with?
What mail?
I'm just gonna...wash. (George walks to the bathroom; screaming) WHY DID I PUT UP TWO? WHY DID I PUT UP TWO?
So what, they don?t have another plane? She couldn't take a bus?
I'll leave when the guy comes in. I gotta tell you, I am loving this yada yada thing. You know, I can cross over my whole life story. (Picks up dental tool)
Why should she like me? Who am I? Huh, there's a million people to like.
(Daring) You think you could?
I lost them. I can usually come up with one good comment during a meeting but by the end it's buried under a pile of gaffs and bad puns.
Hey, what about this? I'm in a car accident. The motorist is uninsured, you with me?
Yeah, woman have no problem getting the hand off. How do they do that?
Aah! the minute I saw this girl, we just clicked. She's got such a nice face. hummmm her eyes, her mouth, nose
Well, you didn't hear it from me, but needless to say, if you go in there - stick with the consumee.
Absolutely. You're telling me there's no room to move on pasta. All starches are a scam.
Because, I've got the coat. I can sit in the car and not get cold.
No. Rice and caramel.
I was in there for two minutes. He didnt do anything. Touch this, feel that  seventy-five bucks!
Yep. I'm leaving first thing tomorrow morning.
Listen. You're beautiful. You're intelligent. You'll meet other girls...
What game?
All you got is instant coffee? Why don't you get some real coffee?
....But after that we really talked didn't we?
Let me show you something, take a look at this... (Another guy at the party interrupts.)
Yeah, good night.
What for?
Yeah.
That's right, who the hell are they? How dare they?!
All right. There's nothing to be worried about. She's just a little annoyed right now. Tomorrow I'll personally go over there. I'll apologize. I'll get the papers. Don't worry. Don't worry. (exits)
You wanted a Yankee, I got you a Yankee.
Just a suggestion. (chuckles and walks back to the yelling guy)
I can't believe they actually found your stolen car.
No, can't say as I did.
Of course. Your massage. (winks) Enjoy your massage. (winks)
(Turning back to Jerry, he takes the check back. He just now notices the shirt Jerry's wearing, and snickers, pointing) Nice shirt.. (Laughs, Jerry shrugs) What is this? Is this what you wore on the show?
Yeah, as a matter of fact, I did.
(wondering where this is leading) No sir.
I could..
It's a coincidence.
Oh shut up.
No, I was just wondering... if you guys, uh, had any gum.
Come on! Come-on.
You see.....WHAT!!
(To Jerry) No, it's about nothing.
I mean, she's beautiful, right? She's just my type. The dark hair, the full lips.
Pssh. Yeah. Right.
Man, would I like to see the look on his face.
Clearer
I I just.. but..
Yeah, yeah. I see the irony. All right. What about this? What if I can find some way to break up with her so that she'll still like me and it doesn't affect the deal.
Of course, not as exciting as miss crop circles, but...
Hmm. Really? Nothing?
I think Im getting tired of it. I mean is that all it does? Hello? La-la-la?
Burned.
I feel like a huge weights been lifted off my shoulders. I... I... I feel happy! Kramer, I dont know how to thank you!
When I was working I spent baby.
Hey, I'm getting in on that.
And there's you ticket.
(laughs) Yeah, it's me. Is this Clayton?
Huh-Hi. (looks around a little) Uhm, is Neil here?
Cleaning
Ah ah Pez dispenser.
You think your parents would have any objections to taking a little kid to Paris with them? (Jerry looks at him confused) It turns out that the kid's father lives in Paris. (chuckling) Is that a coincidence? (Jerry smilies) Eh you know Alec wants me to take him over there so I figure as long as they're going (claps)
Those nachos are killing me.
Ross'.
You're going to the Tony's?
Oh, she's a Kramer. And uh, while I was there I uh happened to pick up another juicy little nugget about our friend.
Were aware of the proximity to the park, yes.
Too much?
You know, I haven't eaten anything.
(from the intercom) Yeah, its George.
All right. I don't.
Why didn't you take your car?
Of course not. I mean sure, there may have been one or two occasions in the past, when I may have reacted in uh impulsive or somewhat immature manner, but those days are well behind me.
You put a hot tub... in your living room?
"You sell them?"
No problem there. Conformity is an obsession with me.
No, no, not really. Ever since Susan passed on, I have good days and bad. (Turns the briefcase towards the woman on his left.) Some days, I'm haunted by one word - why. Why Susan? Why wasn't it me licking those invitations? Why am I still here? Well, I gotta run. (Gets up and leaves the meeting.)
No, no. That's just the thing. Anna told me that Elaine said I was one of the worst seeds she'd ever seen.
I'm not stable? I'm like a rock. I take these glasses off, you can't tell the difference between me and a rock. I put these glasses on a rock. You know what jumps into most people's minds? Costanza!
So how long has it been in the basement?
God bless you.
OOuuoo! They could use the break!
What are you talking about, that's seventy-five bucks! I'm not working, I can't afford that.
I know enough to stay away from it.
Well... we could dance around it a little first.
I can't to myself. I'm exhausted.
(on a pay phone) Hey, hey, it's George, I need ya to do me a favor.
Ah! Health's not good enough. I want more than health. Health's not doing it for me anymore. I'm sick of health.
No, no you really look great.
It's a little unusual. So, uh, Susan and I were thinking, uh, dinner at our house Saturday night. Just the four of us.
Im not gonna watch you do laundry.
George, don't make me get tough with you. Whu, hu, hu, hu huuuu (raises arms) Who says that? She is really cool. What do you think? You think she likes me?
(On the other line) Hey.
Are, are you sure this is decaf? Wheres the orange indicator?
She's playing a recital this week at the McBierney School. You wanna hear her play? I got two extra tickets, you and Elaine could go...
Oh yeah, but that has nothing to do with it.
I see what you mean.
(gesturing with flyer) With Spartacus?
Do you realize in the entire history of western civilization no one has successfully accomplished the Roommate Switch? In the Middle Ages you could get locked up for even suggesting it!
Ah. She's great, isn't she?
What, you don't like the name?
I'd kill to be a 32.
Ohhhhh.. John-John.
Uh, well, you know,...
Um, you know Im starting to think that maybe lobster isnt the way to go.
No.
(Wanting Elaine to take it off his hands, he tries to silence Jerry) Jerry, simmer down.
I like sports. I could do something in sports.
Oh come on? No come on. She took off her hat and there she was (waving his hand over his head) hello. It was like I was looking at myself in the mirror.
Do we have to...?
Hi...
You paying my hotel and airfare to Miami?
So?
Boy, I wish the flamenco was popular here.
I've been to a few of em. If you uh start to get woozy later, which is quite common, stay close to me. I'll get you through it. (chuckles)
You don't understand. A garage. I can't even pull in there. It's like going to a prostitute. Why should I pay, when if I apply myself, maybe I could get it for free? (he hears a horn honking) What? What do you want? Go around me, I'm looking for spaces.
I am an art-adorer! I adore art.
You're selling computers?
Hey Glenn!
Oh no no no no - we have to be in California next week. We're starting a TV show.
Well does it say anywhere in the contract about my car being used as a whorehouse? 'Cause I don't remember reading that clause either..
Drink up. (Levitan takes a drink)
I never tasted a cough medicine I didn't love.
I don't believe it.
Who says?
He he he he
What was that?
"To the victor goes the spoils." What are you going to do tonight?
Two no-tucks.
Korea.
Seemingly. Seemingly, to the untrained eye, I can fully understand how you got that impression. What looked like pushing...what looked like knocking down...was a safety precaution! In a fire, you stay close to the ground, am I right? And when I ran out that door, I was not leaving anyone behind! Oh, quite the contrary! I risked my life making sure that exit was clear. Any other questions?
(identifying it) Wrath of Khan!
(shouting) Dee... Deena!
Ah-ha!
What is that? Its ridiculous! You dont even know what hotel shes staying at, you cant call her. Thats a signal, Jerry, thats a signal! (snaps his fingers) Signal!
Well, that's really not fair.
(Germanic) Ich bin ein sucker.
Yeah, I thought I might give her a call. I, I don't meet that many women. I meet like three women a year. I mean, we've been introduced. She knows my name.
(cocky laughter) Huh haha! (shouts) You're meat, Reilly! You just screwed yourself! (laughter) Ha ha!
Elle McPherson going to be there?
...Six wrong?
All right, I'll tell them my sister died. (Starts fake crying) My poor sister died. She was standing and then she was laughing and then they SHOT her! That's the kind of sick city that we're livin' in. They shoot you for laughing. I must go and comfort my poor family. Jerry, take me home so I can comfort my... my poor family.
Now, you see, I don't get that. We had a relaxed stimulating, great conversation, she doesn't mention it? Why doesn't she mention it?
All the time.
(surprised) Rosses.
Oh my God...You're in jail? (Celia nods.) That is so cool!
Oh, come on, you're good at this.
Hey.
Hi.
I dont want to get out of it.
From my pocket.
I stopped having sex.
Yeah, take it easy.
What are those?
"Well...there's no room for someone like that in this organization."
What difference does it make what she looks like?
The outlet?
How much was it?
No no, I never said I was a good driver, I said I was a good parker.
No sports jacket? I don't need a sports jacket? Writers wear sports jackets.
(worried) Why not?
( to Jerry) What about the letter, should I think about the letter?
This is a brand new jacket. Boy this really burns me up, ...
I'm better than him.
Really.
Boy, she is nice. I like her, I like her Jerry. She's got substance. She oozes substance.
What, are you kidding? (Points at the flaws of Jerry's hands) The knuckles are all out of proportion. you got hair over there - where do you get off comparing your hands to my hands?! This is a one-in-a-million hand. (Points to his own hand)
We'll have 2 slices and 2 grape sodas.
Gammy's gettin' upset!
You miss her, don't you?
And I always take care of my Pisano's. So here is a little something. (drop in tip and worker looks the other way, so George decides to take it out and try again only to get caught)
Well, uh... come in, come, come in. (frantically clears the couch of newspapers and crumbs)
There was something so reassuring about that cozy little space.
I don't know. That's all gonna change.
What's it gonna be? ... You hear that?
Oh. Oh!
What?
(shouting) Fire!!
Come on. Come check out my new place. It'll take you two minutes.
Hi Beth (Scene Ends then re-begins with Beth and George on Beth's couch) Um anyway Jerry told me that uh.. it might have been my comment in the Coffee Shop that broke you up.
Hey.
How you gonna catch him? He's probably boarded the plane already.
Hey hey.
You mean, uh..?
You've been demoted.
Well, she doesn't really want to see Firestorm.
Because I asked you to.
Ill tell you, if I was running for office I would ask for the death penalty for double-parkers. If this is allowed to go on this is not a society. THIS IS ANARCHY!
Elaine, I'm, I'm shocked. I'm shocked. Here I go out in the spirit of the season (Elaine looking like she's not buying a word of it) and spend all my savings to buy you the most beautiful Christmas sweater I have ever seen to show my appreciation to you at Christmas and this is the thanks that I get at Christmas.
Oh, well, don't worry about it -- he's got plenty of money. (spins his chair away from her)
Kramer, what the hell are you talking about?
That's right. He just happened to be the previous owner of the vehicle.
Well you didn't have to say it like that.
No, an old friend of ours, Gary.
Hello, friend. Enjoying the flight?
Jerry, its not my fault.
What is that with the shmoopy?
More jokes?
I go in to use his private bathroom, everybody uses it, and then I get a memo - a memo - telling me to use the men's room in the hall. Well, (laughing) I mean we share it with Pace Electronics. It's disgusting!
Excuse me, I was waiting here.
Hey. I gotta go.
I know the D is the biggest. I've based my whole life on knowing that the D is the biggest.
Yeah, well....
Please give it to me. I love to help people. This is what I do. Come on. I'm going this way. (he takes the table from Jodi's hands and she has no choice but to follow him)
(To Carl) Oh, by the way, order anything you want, it's all on me. Just do me a tiny favor pretend we're old friends. Oh my God! Mr. Morgan! What a coincidence, it's Mr. Morgan. Mr. Morgan, I want you to meet a dear old friend of mine, Carl.
Hand sandwich.
Well, my father works for the United Volunteers, maybe he can get her one.
You know, I think I could have played with dolls if their were dolls in the house. It seems like fun to me. It doesn't seem like a gender thing. I think I would like to play with dolls. What's so terrible?
Well, I'm mentioning his name.
Yes ... yes, yes
Oh, sure. (Holds the box out as Susan takes out a few letters)
I don't know, honey. What do you want to get? [in babying voice] I want you to get anything you want...'cause I love you so much. I want you to be happy. Okay, sweetie?
(laughs - hehe) Well, first, I'm brushing my teeth and this piece of apple-skin, that must have been lodged in there for days, comes loose.
So why didn't you tell me?
(hurriedly leaves Rudy's) They had plans, They had plans!
(Depressed) Well,.. the Andrea Doria.. that was quite a fire. (Moves to the door, leaving)
What are you going to say?
If you want.
No, no, I don't think I'm special. My mother always said I'm not special.
What?
(Mutters) Oh.. okay.. talk to you later.
So, you know, she calls and says she wants to go out with you tomorrow night? God bless! Devil you!
No keys. And I been calling the city all day. Course there's not really a number to call if you wanna make a pothole.
No, not nervous. I'm good, very good. (A beat, then he snaps) I can't do this! Can't do this!
Oh.
I still don't understand this. Abby has a mentor?
What, are you locking the door now?
Wait, wait, did you ever see him throw up?!
[quite out loud, not even pretending to whisper] Elaine!
Tell her about the shoving.
Yeah, right.
Do you? That makes me so happy. Elaine's proud of me Jerry.
Yeah. So what happened?
If you're in some situation where some fast cash will save your life, I'll give you the code.
I thought Mulva hated you.
I've got to tell you, I'm really disappointed in Lupe.
I know but I couldn't think of anything else to say to her.
I would like to dip my bald head in oil and rub it all over your body. [No reaction] You don't understand! It's a miracle! You don't understand because you don't speak English!
He can be pedantic. He can be pedantic.
Of course, the uh, the four passes. (closes partition) Four passes to Madison Square Garden? Wait a minute. Wait a minute! Of course! Chicago! The Knicks are playing the Bulls tonight!
No. So, tonight she's got tickets for that show she's been working on. The Flying Sandos Brother.
Wow, he really does a number on you. (reads) "Seinfeld froze like a deer in the headlights in the face of incessant heckling."
What? You dont like this?
What about me?
Well, how about that?
What?
One left...what a joke.
Sstill love. Still love.
What?
(knocks on the window) Hey, why are all those people milling around my car?
She wants me to take an IQ test.
I won't feel like a writer.
Tell you how you could check.
Who are you to play God!? Every man's time comes! If his number is up, who are you to interfere!?
Yes I'd like to speak to Marisa Tomei, please? Marisa, Hi it's George Costanza.. I'm the short, funny, quirky bald man you met a little while ago, heh! yeah I was just calling 'cos I wanted you to know that I'm not engaged anymore......well huh, She died....Toxic glue from the wedding invitations.....well we were expecting about two hundred people. Yeah... Anyway.. hum I got the funeral tomorrow but huh.. my weekend is pretty wide open and I was wondering... (dial tone interrupts George)..... Hello...Hello..
Yes, yes, she had a nose job. I loved her very deeply. Will she ever speak to me again?
--Astroturf? You know who's responsible for that, don't you?! The Jews! Ah, the Jews hate grass. They always have, they always will.
So you don't speak *any* English at all?
Hi. (waves to Donald and laughs) hahahaha.
(laughing) Have something else. Cmon, have a little dessert?
We sat there for twenty minutes, chewing, staring at each other in a defunct relationship.
Alright, you having a good time there?
Hello? I can take an hour off your hands. Give the kids a chance to see a real live Yankee.
She thinks I'm ugly. I knew it.
That's pretty pathetic.
Awright, I'll see you later.
Hi.
Where are you goin'..
Interference! You cant count that! Come on, are you crazy?! The coin cannot touch anything, it affects it.
Tell me about it. I went out with this girl last week. First I had to pay for dinner, then--
Is "yada yada" bad?
(Mutters) No, it's not.
I was sitting there, c'mon.
Nope! (Starts heading for the door)
What, you think I eat all my meals with you? (To waitress) Excuse me, sweetheart? I think you may have overcharged us. What is this?
Hey, Tim. Quick question. Is it normal for your teeth to make noises, like a hissing or a chirping?
Goodbye (exits cab)
Why not?
Was that wrong? Should I have not done that? I tell you I gotta plead ignorance on this thing because if anyone had said anything to me at all when I first started here that that sort of thing was frouned upon, you know, cause I've worked in a lot of offices and I tell you peope do that all the time.
That's funny. You're a funny guy.
Some other time.
Really? Because people do meet in places besides a bar, huh?
Ill have the tuna.
Yeah. I may have stepped on her arm, too, I don't know.
Well, I'm sure at some point between the years 800 and 1200--somewhere--there were two women living together.
Jerry, unless I pull down on this statuette and a hidden wall opens up, we have checked every square inch of this apartment!
I was supposed to see her. She wasn't supposed to see me.
You see... All right I knew it.
We're perfect. I timed this out so we would pull up at the terminal *exactly* 17 minutes after their flight is supposed to land. That gives them just enough time to get off the plane, pick up their bags and be walking *out* of the terminal as we roll up. I tell you, it's a thing of beauty. I can not express to you the feeling I get from a perfect airport pickup. (starts looking around) What's going on? What are you doing? The Long Island Expressway? What are you getting on the Long Island Expressway for? Do you know what the traffic will be like? This is a suicide mission!
(Needing to get away from his parents, he gets up) I need some air..
Unbelievable, I'm never gonna get out of here. The guy goes to pee, he never comes back. It's like a science fiction story.
Well, it's a tough decision. I have to wear these every day. I'm deciding on a new face.
Well, I didn't really tell Susan about it, and she doesn't really have anything else to do.
Give him the jacket.
Come on you're... uh... you're fine.
Its an incredible deal. I dont know why you dont come with me.
Stacey.
(Stopping him) Ah, excuse me. When your, uh, when your wallet was open, I - I glanced inside, and I couldnt help but notice that you have several crisp dollar bills.
What? I don't see anything.
Alright, here we go.
I'm making it up.
What, you're gonna pass up a wonderful opportunity to put that aloe pusher in her place?
Pardon?
Flip it.
You want me to roll six thousand of these?! What, should I quit my job?!
Well, does he wear bland, drab, olive colored clothing?
Yeah. I am like a drug dealer. I got the guy hooked. I am having lunch at his desk everyday this week. He doesn't make a move without me. It's very exciting.
How do women know about shrinkage?
No, I'm not. I would like to be, but I'm not. What am I gonna do? The book club meets in a few days.
Jerry, I can't. It's like saying to Pavorotti, "Teach me to sing like you."
Yes..
Oh my God it is them.
Hey, what happened with Sandy. I forgot all about it. Did you call her?
Uh, it was dangling! There were only two left in the machine! He mustve bought one, and gotten both.
Bread.
I'm telling you, skip the Drake's wedding, go to the game.
Of course! Alright, maybe I'll say something to Buck.
(quiet, desperate) Maybe she can get me another picture of man-hands. (calling) Elaine!
(sad) Yeah! Yeah. Hey--hey you, you know.. Maybe I'll call you sometime.
I'm serious.
Kramer, hey, hey! (Gets up out of his seat)
Oh, don't tell me. Lloyd?
You never had sex in the office before?
(Trying to keep his voice down) I think you've done a lot more than talk! You betrayed me!
It better be.
So, Jerry and Nina, huh?
Costanza. Costanza.
Yeah.
Sorry.
Hello-o-o-o Elaine!
No, Can't be...For instance I remember when we first met, we had a great conversation.
I don't know how a fish could eat laughs.
I need some water. I gotta get some water.
Not a plane crash. (leaving) Is it a plane crash?
When?
What?
(Obviously lying) No.
(talking to nobody) I like horses. Maybe I could be a stable boy.
My card won't work there; they're not on the Plus system.
...stop pushing. (to Elaine) Kramer spilled ammonia.
Why would we want to help somebody?
Oh what's the difference? We'll all be dead eventually.
Oh, yeah. I read what you said to the papers yesterday. You weren't in on the planing. What planning? YOU THINK WE PLANED THIS? Uh?
Yes!
(animated) You're letting him have a woman over?!
Do I really have to buy her something?
(Showing Jerry the menu) "Chef recommends"
Breath problem?
My god!!!
Its a Twix! Theyre all Twix! It was a setup! A setup, I tell ya! And youve robbed it! Youve all screwed me again! Now, gimme one! Gimme a Twix!
You could eat of that shotgun.
What was that all about?
All right here you go.
Like this.
Certainly not.
Yes it is! You're very charming!
Bosomy?
Magic time.
Yes. Thank you! Is that so hard?
No, they're not funny at all. No, I have no funny friends. I'm the funny one. El Clowno.
Come on, hurry up, old man! I'm an animal!
(upset) But you can't stay here. There's no place to sleep!
Uh, yeah. Do you know Babs?
All right!
Hey, hey, hey!
There's no house! It's a lie! There's no solarium. There's no Prickly Pete. There's no other solarium.
Well, if it doesn't concern me, then I can stay. (Kramer grabs the back of George's chair, drags him out into the hallway and closes the door.)
Well I am actually going to have a secretary and I get to do the interview.
Got her machine. Im dead, Im a dead man. Thats it. Im dead, Im a dead man. Dead man.
Alright, this is what ya gotta do I need ya to go out to the parking lot at Yankee Stadium, take the flyers off my car.
What does it look like Im doing?
Tell you what, I'll make a deal with you. I'll sell it to you right now for ten bucks.
Why not?
I think I may be in love with this woman.
Well, should I call you later?
(laughs) Not quite.
No, I-I-I-I'm good. Really.
They had a pastry cart you wouldn't believe.
This good be so sweet, Jerry. Saving lives? She's one step away working at the clinique counter!
It's this way... AND THEY TAKE OFF AGAIN, PAIRING OFF
I know, swan dives from twenty floors up, lands right on top. What do I got a bulls eye up there? He couldn't move over two feet? Land on the sidewalk. It's city property.
Oh, ok. Thank you. It was good talking to you.
Your parents'll never let you do it.
Cut it. (goes back to the group) (Yelling) Would you stop signing?
They got a new intern from Francis Louis High. His name is Keith. He comes in Mondays after school.
So you can't duplicate 'em.
"....I like spicy chicken"
Ill just, uh, get a paper...
Yes well unfortunately you'll never get the chance to find out.
Yea, she likes you.
Finicky? Prissy? Fastidious?
No, that's Jerry.
Oh.
Matches? Long matches.
Yes! (both laugh) God, I've never felt so alive!
I'd like to say it once to someone that can actually hear it!
Because important things go in a case. You got a skull for your brain, a plastic sleeve for your comb, and a wallet for your money.
Yea, ya..ya know I feel terrible about Joey but it's jus..it's a great business opportunity. I-I don't even know how long I'm gonna be away for.
No, she's taking this course in education for her masters. It's part of her research project, so I have to be a guinea pig.
Jerry?
Loni Anderson?!
See now this I don't get.
Sir, I'm sure it's not a police matter.
What do you mean? The engagement is off, we get the TV back. That's business.
(to Carrie) It's just that, I know her, and boy...
Moisturizer?
Oh don't-
No.
So then he makes his own bed?
oh,
(con't) All right, you know she's got that laugh. What did you say? It's like Elmer Fudd sitting on a juicer?
Shut up!
Yeah.
The point is, however it got done, it's done. So, any luck with the car?
If I was a different person.
Oh, it's gotta be fifty! Hee hee! You know how much Ted Danson makes, huh?
No, you can have it.
Yeah, it's her uncle's.
All right, uh, okay, I got it, um, Ill sing.
My car! My caaaaarrrr!
The New York Yankees!
(to Donna) Why did you have to get me in trouble?
Hey. How's your day, good?
Well, let's just say it wouldn't exist without me. (Notices another person in the library dressed the same as Celia.) So you two uh, shop at the same store, (hu)?
(over the speaker) It's George.
Keith, Keith Wa What happened? Where's Keith?
What does the chaperone do?
Well I'm sure you have secrets from me. I don't know anything about your cycles.
(trying to laugh it off) Right. C'mon! I'm having an affair with Elaine?! If I was having an affair with Elaine, I wouldn't tell you I'm going to see Elaine. I would make up some other person to tell you I was gonna go see, and then I would go see Ela..Elaine.
It seemed so disorganized.
What was that?
Right.
What's the difference? The money is not important.
Then I got off the phone right away.
(Fed up with his parents) Actually, I think I'm pretty clear on it.
When you're playing the piano do you think about me?
I dont know why you even bother with this ping pong guy, Ill tell you that.
(trying to laugh it off) No, I was just wondering. The information could be relevant.
Alright. I'll run it by a few people.
yeah.. the ambulance got there very quickly
(Yelling out to the whole coach) Funny guy! (Points to Jerry) Right here!
Gimme a half-hour.
Well, he does.
I was handcuffed to the bed.. In my underwear, (Sighs) where I remained.. (Scene cuts to another story) She was attractive.. She was, also, infact, a Nazi.. (Cuts to another story) The water.. that I had been swiming in was.. very cold. And, when I dropped the towel, there was.. significant shrinkage.. (Scene cuts to, yet, another story) Her parents were looking at me.. So, there I was, with a marble rye hanging from the end of a fishing pole.. (Scene cuts to his closing statements) In closing, these stories have not been embellished, because - they need no embellishment. They are simply, horrifyingly, the story of my life as a short, stocky, slow witted bald man. (Gets up) Thank you. (Every memeber of the board shows some sign that George's story is most deserving of the apartment. Ricardi is crying. George turns to leave, then remembers one more thing..) Oh, also.. my fiance died from licking toxic envelopes that I picked out. (Sobs and loud crying erupts from the board members) Thanks again. (Leaves. Eldridge looks defeated)
No, you just tell him ah, an old boyfriend has come back into your life.
(gets up to leave the table) HELLO!!! (angrily)
What are you doing?
(Gesturing to Jerry) Check the raiser.
Ade, you're a wonder. (he he -- george laughs)
So it's just mono.
What are you doing? Where do you think you're going?
Well, no.
Of course hes been in touch with him. Hes left two messages. He just hasnt heard back yet, thats all.
Pre-nup of course ..Kramer....
Yes. The New Yorker.
I'll tell you what that is - that's a violation of club rules. Now I got him! And you're my witness!
Wh..what're you doing here?
Wow! The weekend.
So uh... been to a bris before?
Yeah, tell im. But quickly, Im double parked here.
Really?
Jose Jimenez, ... verrry funny. ..very funny.
What about candle holders?
Uh, no, I'm not.
I'll take one. It's possible.
Peter, Paul and Mary.
Obviously.
Well uh....
She's ahem....gone
Can't we just fix the old one?
This is a fantastic place! I always thought it was a meat packing plant!
Well get it back! It's very important. (winks)
I won fifty bucks! Boy, this is great. Too bad Elaine's not here.
On-the-street cell-phone call is the lowest phone call you can make.
Whats in it?
ahhhhh (exhaling) Jerry, my young friend, you're so nave. You are so, so nave. You know about a few things. You know about comedy, a little bit about relationships, some baseball, but you are so far out of your element here, you are embarrassing yourself. Now listen to me. I'm negotiating. Negotiation, this is what'cha do in business.
(pauses) A marine biologist?
He's Keith Hernandez. You're Jerry Seinfeld.
You think?
Oh.
Should we tell him we're leaving?
Me run in? Why don't you run in?
(With pride) Made it up.
All right, you know you're not any help at all here. I don't know what even the point is of talking to you anymore.
Ya, you go.
(Thomassoulo helps George get up) Yeah, what the hell.
I really like those sons of bitches.
But you are Blanche... You *are* in the shackles. Oh, I can't wait to read my *Time* magazine! Laaaast copy, too. Maybe I'll read it tomorrow-- in the park! It's supposed to be a beeyootiful day! Have a nice life... sentence, that is!
"What day is today?....Aw. ..Tuesday! Damn it. I shouldn't have worked out today. Mr Wilhem has called a big meeting and now I'm gonna be sweating through the whole thing."
(entering Monk's) Hey.
I should've hit the little son-of-a-bitch. I can't stand kids. Adults think it's so wonderful how honest kids are. I don't need that kind of honesty. I'll take a deceptive adult over an honest kid any day.
It's like puberty that never stops. Ear puberty, nose puberty, knuckle puberty, you gotta be vigilent. Let me ask you this Do you know where Walker Street is downtown? I've got a league meeting there.
What's it say?
Yes.
Regardless. I had to walk around for the rest of the party in some cheap Metlife windbreaker. Now, it is payback time.
Boy! What a story! I'm speechless. Speechless. I have no speech.
Tryptophan.* (*footnote - see end of script)
Hurry up.
Hes an importer.
Well, it would be OK if Darryl was here.
Hello, Ken. It's George Costanza. I think we need to talk.
Her back went out. She's gotta be there for a couple of days. All she said on the way over in the car was, "Why, George, why?!".. I said, "Because it's there!"
No. (dips the chip) You dip the way you want to dip...(bites the chip) I'll dip the way I want to dip. (dips the chip again.)
Well it's not up my alley! It's one thing if I make it up. I know what I'm doin, I know my alleys! You got me in the Galapagos Islands livin' with the turtles, I don't know where the hell I am.
You're right, how did I miss that? (Begins unlocking the door, mutters under his breath) Maybe because it's a crock of shit.
What is this 'saving movies' thing? Something's playing, you go.
Help! Someone!
Yes. Well...
Well, thank you for your support.
What do you know? You were in the nut house.
I like history. Civil War. Maybe I could be a professor, or something.
Just take the cap off.
Chaperone? What, are you kidding?
Excuse me sir. Would you mind watching my bag for a minute?
I knew I had hit my high note so I thanked the crowd and I was gone.
That's what she says. I say, listen. It was an old cat. It died of natural causes. So get this, now she tells me that I gotta buy her a brand new cat. I say listen, honey. First of all, it was a pretty old cat. I'm not gonna buy you a brand new cat to replace an old dying cat. And second of all, I go out to the garbage, I find you a new cat in fifteen seconds. I say, you show me an autopsy report that says this cat died of starvation, I spring for a new cat. So she says something to me, like, uh, I dunno, get the hell out of here, and she breaks up with me. Now don't you think that would be a great case on L.A. Law?
[Realizing full well it isn't] ...Yes it is.
Maybe she moved it up in the rotation.
What, you're gonna take her word over mine? I'm your best friend!
It's an inter-office envelope. It get passed around all over the office.
So you feel okay?
Well, it worked when I met George Peppard last week.
What's that?
I'm pretty sure I wouldn't.
Pamela?! Awright, I tell you what. You look like nice people, I'm gonna help you out. You want a beautiful name? Soda.
Well I gotta go talk to Beth.
Hey!
What? The guy asked you to HELP HIM MOVE? Wow.
Yeah, just tell him to hurry it up.
You already got it.
A man carries a wallet.
(Yelling from the bathroom) Don't tell her anything, she'll kill me!!
You know, this is very nice, but I really could take a cab. Really.
How about Bozo?
I need higher. This has paba in it, I need paba-free.
Alright so you made out with someone.
Did you talk to him?
Got it. (the waitress walks away) Did you just see what happened here?
Why don't you just ask Jeffrey?
Yeah. Anyway, he shamed me into it.
Yeah. (Noticing this makes him out to be the bad kid, he gets defensive) Well, I couldn't run over there the way I was!
Narks?
No, you didn't mention it.
(pointing out the positive) But happy.
No, no. No, no, no. (determined) We're staying on me. We haven't solved anything yet.
I know.
so, uh, Steven.. I see you're president of the chess club.
Just because a candy bar fails to fall from its perch
Good morning Mr. Wilhelm.
(Takes a few seconds to mull this one over. Shooting Jerry a confused look, he repeats it) "The panties your mother laid out for you"? (Jerry nods) What does that mean?
Yup. It's really just a question of what kind. Thinking about a bar stool.
Actually, I did have a thought.
What am I talking about? Come on. (laughing) You don't think I bought all that? (does a little move)
There's porn.
(singing) Master of the house/Doling out the charm/Ready with a handshake and an open palm/Tells a saucy talk/Loves to make a stir/Everyone appreciates a...
Come on, lets not stand here too long, we might run in to her.
Eh, don't mention it.
(anticipating the answer) Not.
How good looking?
In every situation. No matter how silly I look. (Tastes his Clams Casino) Hm.. tastes a little funky.
Hey, grown-up. (they both chuckle, George notices Gwen enter the room) Oh my god, there she is. Go ahead, go ahead. (to the others) Let's go, let's go. All right what are they saying?
Fine, I'll make an appointment. (He leaves)
Thanks. Gee, you know, I thought you were mad at me.
Okay. Now, why do I have to see (points) you?
Take it easy. Take it easy. It's not the end of the world.
(to Jerry) Oh, get outta here.
I gotta prep. I need a couple of anecdotes, a few you-were-right-abouts. It's a whole procedure. Wasn't Fragile Frankie the one that used to run into the woods every time he got upset?
Oh they'll get out of the way. You really smell banana?
Right.
No, it's doing the same thing to someone that they did to you.
I think I'd be good at that. I talk to people all the time. Someone even told me once they thought I'd be a good talk show host.
I feel like I got a B12 shot. This is like a taste explosion!
Deeply in love. If you can't say anything bad about a relationship, you shouldn't say anything at all.
Oh, I think it is! I think that's exactly what it is!
You know what? It doesn't matter, because I quit!
George.
(to Elaine) Do you want us to go with you?
You have a car?
(Muttering, slow) Hang on, Ma.. hang on..
Kramer, what the hell are you talking about?
And then assuming the strike is resolved, on April 14th, we, ah, play the Angels. So lets clear a floor at the Anaheim Hotel.
Ok, ok, fine! It's changed, it's not really the point. Anyway, I'm thinking of making a big move.
I can't do this! I can't do it. I have tried. I'm here. It's impossible.
Have you ever seen a Schnitzer's rye? It - it's huge!
I'm choking!
Have you ever given your code to anyone?
No, I uh...
She said no.
Yeah, he was talking to Marla.
What?
129 west 81st street and hurry.
Well then she's just a Liar, Isn't she?
Really? They work here in the office?
Because you're a gymnastics teacher. It's only natural.
What is that? Is taht the pole?!
I don't see why's she more self-conscious about that than her toe thumbs.
We'll ask him. (opens partition) My dear fellow, where are you dropping us?
Yeah.
(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o Kramer!
Well what about all the Lloyd Braun sales?
I quit my job.
Is it with a "y"?
Ewings hurt? How long is he going to be out?
What accident?
Very good. Juicy.
Why not?
(Frantically) Did anybody call here asking for Vandelay industries?
June, June, June.
Yes.
I can't eat with you leanin' over like this. Just look straight forward.
Yeah, yeah, right here. (hands it to him)
Hello?
Well, what should I do, Kramer?
Oh - I've got something.
What exactly is mutton?
Bear with you! This is a parking lot PEOPLE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO GET
Hey.
I'm not gonna be nice. That's how I got the job.
What'd you ask me for?
I think so.
The little extra moan you threw in there. Laying it on a bit thick, don't you think?
Oh well, that's, uh, thats just because we're, uh, standing on opposite sides.
All right, no more lies. Elaine is been chosen to represent the Upper West Side in the next Biosphere project.
My hand is out.
Well, you know, I shouldn't have let you into Kramer's, now you want to go into Elaine's...she entrusted me with her spare keys, how can I just let you in?
Duncan Meyers?
Why should I?
It's two completely different sounds. "ih" and "eh".
So, you were saying how, um...about the script...
You don't need the cufflinks! You have the same name! (no reaction) 'Jerry'! (heads for door, grabbing his coat)
I wrote. Pfft, *I* wrote.
So I spoke to the security guard.
Well um, what about tomorrow night?
Yep. And it didn't take very long either.
This guy from my old neighborhood. Lloyd Braun. He's a big advisor to Mayor Dinkins. He thinks he's so cool.
Ah, ...A beautiful successful intelligent woman's in love with me and I throw it all away. uh oh boy. Now I'll spend the rest of my life living alone. I'll sit in my disgusting little apartment watching basketball games, eating Chinese take out. Walking around with no underwear. Because I'm too lazy to do a laundry.
You're very good. Very good with the moanings and the gyrations. Y-You really had me going there for a minute.
I'm feeling something else here, Jerry!
You haven't won. You may think you've won, but you haven't won. Do you know why? It's not over. This is not over. I'm not forgetting what's happening here. You have my ten dollars. I will get it back. Alright, don't worry. It's not over. I'm going now. Good bye. I will be back.
We got a soccer game in Chile. Anyway, the plane crashes. Who are you gonna eat to survive?
I've done the march in. Best feeling in the world.
