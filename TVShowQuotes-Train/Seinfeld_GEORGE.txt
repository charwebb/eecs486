(Looks at her) Yeah, uh, no menus. (Waves her off)
Thats exquisite. Listen, uh, if its not too much trouble, could you pass me that paper over there?
What if there is a fire?
Yeah. Yes! I just haven't seen you in a long time.
She might not be comfortable.
Hnn! Let me see that.
Go back?
Ok, fine. It's going to be very interesting, very interesting if they don't show up tonight. You know my mother made all this Paella.
I am aware. I am aware.
Stop it, stop it! It's not fair. It's not fair. I don't like this situation, Jerry. I don't like it one bit.
(resolved) Why not. (determined) If she can't find me, she can't break up with me. And, if we're still goin' out, she has to gooo to the ballll.
Sometimes in life, the gods smile upon you, my friends.
We talked about his new batting stance, you know, I'm not crazy about it, but I said , 'Donny, go with it 'till it stops workin'.' Donny baseball. He's a helluva guy.
Oh ho! Class, huh? At Columbia? Let me tell you something, pal. I called the registrars office. I checked you out. They have no record of a Ray Thomas at that school! You liar!
And, it is all because of that car
(Not wanting to make Elaine mad) I guess it's not important.
we rode along all the way to the hospital
I don't know, I didn't ask.
All right, let me just... I'm gonna grap an apple.
You mean a walk back in? That's the toughest move in the business. You're sending me out into no-mans-land, and if I get shot down I have to crawl all the way back. Well I can't do it! I can't do it, I tell ya!
I'm trying, dammit.
(interested) Really?
What do you mean "might"? You don't think he really owned this car?
Of course I do.
Well, why don't *you* go, and I could save the seats. You said you didn't like saving anyway.
I gotta go.
Loni Anderson?!
Sure. Thank you for coming in. (Tom eats some raisins)
Yeah?
Well, you gotta do it.
I need food, Jerry. I feel faint, I'm getting light headed.
Ovaltine. Have you ever had this stuff? Why is it called Ovaltine?
Yeah, see, uh, when we met, I was over there and, uh, you were over here, so the image, uh, the image was reversed, like, uh, like in the mirror.
I love when they touch your arm. I can't get enough of that. Why is that?
One left...what a joke.
Uh, Carol, can I talk to you for a second? Right now?
Hey, it's George.
I know, but he's your son.
It's really not accurate. Nobody drinks from a water cooler any more - they use bottles.
Face up on her back?
My favorite.
(well, obviously) Yes.
Yeah, yeah, but he doesn't wear glasses.
What do you mean - "Not letting you?"
Hey, what happened with Sandy. I forgot all about it. Did you call her?
This prison stinks.
No, not that I know of. (winks)
Funny, cause I happen to be very good friends with Keith Hernandez.
I would imagine it's all naked.
Im good.
Well, I wanna put a picture of me and my boss Mr. Morgan up at the office.
Oh no, you're not going out on a high note with me Mr. Kruger!
Curly.
(Definite) All together.
What is with this dog, I thought we were taking it to the pound.
See, It's not so hard.
Fabulous, I'll think about that George, thank you!
You go in the living room. I'll take the test in here.
So why didn't you tell me?
What do you mean? The engagement is off, we get the TV back. That's business.
We got a soccer game in Chile. Anyway, the plane crashes. Who are you gonna eat to survive?
Hello.
He massacred you.
(emerging from bathroom, buttoning his shirt) A gymnast! I can't believe it, you didn't tell me she was a gymnast.
So...
Oh man! I knew I was gonna love the opera.
Sure, sure, sure, sure. (patting Jerry on the shoulders) How about these seats? Are these fantastic, huh? Huh? I feel like Lincoln.
Yeah.. (Trying to remember) Poverotti.. Domingo.. and.. uh.. the other guy.
Yeah, the kind that Castro smoked. You can't buy ?em anywhere.
I offered to pay. She should've said no.
...so mind you, at this point I'm only going out with her two or three weeks. So she goes out of town and she asks me to feed her cat. So at this time, there's a lot of stuff going on in my life and, uh, it slips my mind for a few days. Maybe a week. Not a week, five, six days.
(To a passing waitress) I'll have some coffee and a doughnut.
I got to give the players most of the credit for that.
Pardon?
Are you sure?
This is horrible.
Well, I might be getting into that.
I was not winking you idiot. That was the grapefruit. It's like acid. I need that card back. It's Mr. Steinbrenner's. I was responsible.
They never try anything.
Guys, hitting is not about muscle. It's simple physics. Calculate the velocity, v, in relation to the trajectory, t, in which g, gravity, of course remains a constant. (Hits a home run) It's not complicated.
The attic? Y-you haven't wore any of those clothes for years.
Why?
(Scoffs) ARe you kidding? Lincoln Center. Alice Tully Hall, the Met. Magnificent facilities.
What did you do?
(waving) How can I not think about it? Look at the size of this thing.
Well, you see, what happened was...the doctor - the very same doctor that was attending to my late aunt - suffered an untimely stroke, and lost the use of his right hand, so...obviously I was unable to get the death certificate. However, I do have this. (Reaches inside his coat and takes out a Polaroid photo.)
So then he makes his own bed?
Jon Voight bit you?
Can I say one thing to you? And I say this with an unblemished record of staunch heterosexuality.
Well I've never met your sister but obviously these are not hard-and-fast rules. (to the waitress) Darling, the tea is getting a little cold sweetheart.
How's that Tony?
Parole! (Feigning joy) That's dynamite!
No, Can't be...For instance I remember when we first met, we had a great conversation.
Well, I think you should drop him down to Step Two.
All right Bubble Boy. Let's just play... Who invaded Spain in the 8th century?
Aren't you concerned about the security guard?
My car! My caaaaarrrr!
And you don't have to pay.
Yes, yes, I am.
Oh (snorts) Articulate....Me? I've never articulated anything, i'm completely incoherent.
Five-hundred dollars?! What?
This is the thing where you go and you have to make your own pizza?
No, no, no, no. Borrowing money from a friend is like having sex. It just completely changes the relationship.
(urgent whisper) Elaine! You have got to get me Marisa Tomei's phone number!
Wheret?
How come we never hear him?
La-la-la-la-la-la-la! [flashbacks to Susan]
(incredulous) What?
Well I was dropping of the calzone money for the week.... Um shouldn't you be at work by now?
I got a headboard.
Into what?
Yes! I see enormous potential here.
Seriously, have they though about changing the setting?
It's George
Morning, dad.
Is there ever a good time to have your parents stay with you?
Oh yeah, al-almost. Almost.
Hi, it's me. It's Georgie Boy. What's going on?
No, no. That's just the thing. Anna told me that Elaine said I was one of the worst seeds she'd ever seen.
You, uh, didn't dance again, did you?
Yes!
(Holding out his arms - giving praise) It's beautiful. Now, what do I say?
You know you buy a big salad for somebody it would be nice if they knew it.
I, uh, oh, broke a shoelace today.
You see (to Jerry). You see. You see what Im talking about. It's all just slipping away. And you're letting it happen. (exits -- slamming the door)
What are you doing here, I though you were going to the airport.
A pack of teenagers?
Thanks, see you later, Donna.
I'd like to say it once to someone that can actually hear it!
Mothers say things. My mother goes babbling on and on like a crazy person.
Okay, uh, look, if you want to just keep on doing the same old thing, then maybe this idea is not for you. I, for one, am not going to compromise my artistic integrity. And I'll tell you something else, this is the show and we're not going to change it. (To Jerry) Right?
Ah, shut up.
Prognosis Negative! (again in a funny voice)
Why?
(To Elaine) Hey, what happened?
All Simons was able to find out is that hes in the hospital.
Dad?!
The pig-man can take the bus.
Kramer, I, I, I, uh, I need to talk to Jerry privately.
Are you often on business trip? Nice...oh, hey nice ice-bucket.
Can't you think of something. Call in a bomb threat.
I'm leaving.
Hey Rachel!
Yea... (sinks in) What? No, no!
Haha (laughs)
Who do I like? I, like, uh, Art, Vandelay.
My father opened his shirt...
My bag?
U-ok. (George closes the window and shoos Elaine off. He opens the door to Monica.) Here you go.
No, its not a problem, I can get rid of the apartment this afternoon.
Yeah you did, you classed it up!
Shortness of breath..
What happens if the husband dies after the wife, who brings in the clothing in then?
"These pretzels are making me thirsty"? That was one line! You got fired!
What'dya got?
I saw them making out, you can believe it.
I know what you were trying to do. Nobody does it better than me.
You coulda damaged my hand!
So what! Have a yoke! It won't kill you.
You went home with him?
Yeah.
He knows this guy, Wilkinson. He made a fortune in the stock market. Now hes got some new thing. You know, theres supposed to be a big merger. He wasnt even supposed to say anything. You guys should think about doing this too.
We go into NBC.
I can't to myself. I'm exhausted.
I think I saw him. I think it's him.
No, of course not...
Hey Deena, come on, give us a hug. (they hug) Oh my gosh, you look as pretty as you did back in high school.
Well, it comes and goes.
You can't leave! This is an ambulance! This is an emergency!
Nooo...
How much is that?
I'm losin' it
Why?
I, uh, just think it's a little unusual. Two people to sit on one side...and leave the other side empty.
Yes! Yes, all right--anything!
(yells) Wow! Who put this cup right on the new table!
All right, okay. Let's go, details.
Jerry please, that's very nice, but, uh, (closes the door) where would we be going?
(standing) C'mon, what're you talking about?
No. Now I'll always have this doubt about the car. What, your jaw still hurts?
Oh, n-no comparison.
Because my parents happen to be two pretty wonderful people.
That's what I'm saying.
(shaking hands with Morty) Morty, always a pleasure.
How' you doing?
Kramer.
I can't carry a pen. I'm afraid I'll puncture my scrotum.
You really think so?
I put my pants on, Sid.
Yes, a shame. That is exactly how I would put it. Now Mrs. Sweedler, with all due discretion and sensitivity, and taking in the whole scope of the situation, I just can't help but think that, the hospital is somehow responsible for compensating the other, still living 'victim' of horrendous, horrendous tragedy.
No, don't call her.
First time in my life I've ever gotten back at someone.
Hey look, he's back.
Because before you know it he'll be having lunch with him. You know how these interoffice politics work.
(stares at card)
Yuh. What about physically?
My place? NO, no, no. I hate my place. I don't wanna go back to my place.
This uniform, what's it made from?
Well...I'll ask Susan about it later.
Oh no, Morgan is a good man sir.
Say you go to the bathroom at two o'clock in the morning, what's the outfit? I mean, you dressing up or is it come as you are?
The Rosses have started up a foundation, Jerry, and I have to sit on the board of directors.
You know, I cant believe youre bringin in an extra bed for woman that wants to sleep with you. Why dont you bring in an extra guy too?
Oh, she's got the hue. So, what's going on with you and Melanie? I mean, I know you're not getting married, but uh, things are happening?
So just kick her out.
It won't for a while. At least not until after the cast comes off.
He had a TV show! He had cartoons!
Well what if I told you I'm thinking of moving here?
(interrupting) Elaine. Shut up.
Im sorry, I dont see the big deal about being a matador. The bull charges, you move the cape, whats so hard?
Hey, last night, I found a whole Weeble Village right behind the EZ Bake oven.
What does that mean?
(While pointing at Jerry) Not me! Him! His fault! He betrayed me!
So we'll do it tomorrow.
No. Why must it be so difficult? Why is there all this tension and hostility? Why can't I just walk up to a woman on the street and say, "Hi. I'm
You think it's contact? It has to be touched?
No, you haven't. Well, maybe you have. What do I know.
(improvising) My uh uncle is having an operation. I just wanted to see how he was.
Wait a minute, you were at a funeral, right?
Yeah, you gotta watch for the jellyfish.
Hey, was that a joke about Houdini?
Well, you never know. (picks up more shrimp) Let's see how many I can fit in my mouth.
Were really glad for you.
Yada.
Can't go, Why not?
(frantic) Jerry! Jerry, muh--muh--my hair-dryer ruined the picture! An' I need another one or I can't get back into the forbidden city!
This guy's giving me the stare-ahead.
Senegal?
Susan loves the sponge.
If we could just harness this power and use it for our own personal gain, there'd be no stopping us.
You know my driver's waiting, I really should get running. Good to see you guys again.
The uniforms! Did you see how they played? Listen to these comments! (reads from the paper) "Wade Boggs 'What a fabric! Finally we can breathe.' Luis Palonia 'Cotton is king.' Paul O'Neill 'I never dreamed anything could be so soft and fluffy.' "
Yeah, Cubans.
Umm... No.
Yeah.
What's the difference? The money is not important.
Kramer, what the hell are you talking about?
(worked up) Wha...You gotta be kidding me?!
(Mutters) No, it's not.
Thank God that's over.
So, you gonna buy his art?
You heard the man. I guess you gotta be moving your car.
Wait a minute, please--
She said first row! Right behind the dugout!
She doesn't deserve a baby shower. She deserves a baby monsoon. She deserves Rosemary's baby!
Pulp can move, Baby! Why didn't you eat a real breakfast?
Jerry, just remember. It's not a lie... if you believe it.
You talked all about that?
I don't want it to feel good.
Fine.
Really?
Uh-huh.
(Concerned) Why're you doing this, Jerry? Is it your career? Things will pick up.
(CONT'D) Look at the time, that's it.
You know, that, that thing about her being too good for him. I mean, I was just bein' folksy. They could tell I was just being folksy..?
Whaddya mean, you'll ``get'' the popcorn and the soda?
Well, he does.
(putting the car in reverse) Oh beautiful! Look at that, the dream space right in front of Jerry's building. Huh? Dreams can come true, what did I tell you?
You idiots. You're gonna wear down the battery.
Important step. Maybe the most important.
I was sitting there, c'mon.
How do you know?
She stayed over?
Would I want to see what Mary Todd wore to Lincoln's funeral?
Yeah. So how does that help me?
You know, I think I'm a little bit scared of her. She's five-three, like a hundred pounds. I'm frightened to death of her.
Well, I don't really like her.
Ahhhhh...
Any, uh.. progress, there? What's the latest?
Yeah.
Ava was one of the reasons I used to like going to work, she was a friend. Now we sleep together and suddenly, I don't know how to talk to her. Every time I go to the bathroom I pass her desk. I have to plan little patter. I spend half my day writing. Then afterwards, I sit in my office and analyze how it went. If it was a good conversation, I don't go to the bathroom for the rest of the day. I see her laughing and talking with other people, they're all so loose and relaxed, I think, 'that used to be me. I want to go back there again.'
Look I need you to do me a favor. I need you to get me lunch at Pisano's.
See, I think people would talk about it at the coffee machines.
She said she liked me. No kiddin' she said that?
I got a message from the Rosses at work today.
You've still got pretty good coverage. Once the enemy advances beyond this perimeter - (points at Kurt's head with a pen) - then you won't be Kurt anymore.
Missing his plane? Wasn't that a charter flight?
I know but I couldn't think of anything else to say to her.
A man gave me... a massage. hu, hu
Kramer, what are you talking about...Janet doesn't look anything like Jerry
Well does it say anywhere in the contract about my car being used as a whorehouse? 'Cause I don't remember reading that clause either..
Oh! Nuts! Excellent! You know what I love? How there's two nuts named after people. Hazel...and filbert.
I, I dont know.
What?!
Exactly, but theyre on there  waiting. She said she cant wait to see me, were having dinner tonight. Shes supposed to call me as soon as she gets home.
Girlfriend, yeah, right.
I can't park in a garage.
And there's you ticket.
Yeah, about ten, fifteen minutes. But I have to stop at a vegetable stand.
A signal, right, um, okay, uh, okay, the signal is, Ill call out tippy-toe!
No... What guy?
Oh, come on, it's five minutes.
Wendy? Is that the uh, physical therapist?
Thank you.
Yeah, sure. (big smile) Then my father will have no place to sleep. (snaps fingers) He's gotta move out.
But Jerry, this is not coming out!
I don't know, I just can't. Nobody in my family can pay for parking, it's a sickness. My father never paid for parking; my mother, my brother, nobody. We can't do it.
Ah, great. All right, with the wine I'm in over twenty dollars now.
Gotta go.
Yeah.
What a bald paradise that must have been. Nobody knew.
Ahh. Good for you.
(embarrassed/self-conscious about his gut) Do I? Thanks.. You too..
Yes she is. It's a pity we won't be seeing much more of her.
You know it's a public phone, you're not supposed to just chit-chat.
Well, I was exaggerating a bit, just for effect.
Robin? Robin!
An apartment complex, the uh the Eiffel Towers. uumm Like I said uh you'll be getting a postcard uh in a few days and again I'm sorry.
Boy!
Hey, shut up.
Just as she was. Hey, Mario! Remember us?
I'm out! Fantastic apartment right across from mine, huh. I can't wait for you to see it.
I don't know. They're all very suspicious.
No!
(pause) Are you?
But Kramer, isn't it a question of hygiene?
If anything happens here, can I count on you?
What actress does she remind you of?
Physical therapy is covered by insurance?
(pleading) Alright..
Oh, sure. (Holds the box out as Susan takes out a few letters)
(snaps fingers) There you go.
millions and millions
That's allowed? You're allowed to postpone it?
(angry) She won't sweeten, and I'm bitter!
Why does he have to stand?
No, I don't know who was doing that.
Yeah.
Oh, it's gotta be fifty! Hee hee! You know how much Ted Danson makes, huh?
(Pointing to them) Office Christmas gift. I tell you, this Human Fund is a gold mine!
Ill meet her outside the building.
So fast? What about me?
Well, let's just say it wouldn't exist without me. (Notices another person in the library dressed the same as Celia.) So you two uh, shop at the same store, (hu)?
Oh, very refreshing. (Thinking again) Sex is like joining a private club. I'll be the same me tomorrow, but suddenly, the no trespassing sign will be gone.
And if I don't call...
You can't compromise your principles!
Yeah, I mentioned Simons. Next thing I know, Im in the parking lot. Perhaps they had some sort of a falling out. Ill tell you one thing. I dont know what hes got. But for a sick guy, hes very strong.
I was there! I saw a drain!
You're with a *woman*!
What?
I know what the problem is - I like her too much. That's why I can't make a move.
(Relieved) I haven't? I'm okay? I'm okay? Oh, thank you, thank you, Doctor! I don't know how to thank you.
Right! And these pigeons broke the deal. I will not accept the blame for this!
If she'd just take a plane somewhere.
(In awe) Wow!
C'mon, c'mon...(stands up and physically rolls Betsy to the left side of the couch.) See, now, is that so bad?
No, no...
You're a very handsome man, by the way.
My censor quit two years ago. He checked into a clinic. Emotionally exhausted.
Well, I was buttering myself up for a nice shave --
Yes, I think I would.
Now let's try "breast"... Celeste... Kest...
Oh, please don't tell me you love me again, Jerry, I can't handle it.
Well, what do they look like?
What signal? What-what signal?
Jerry. Marla. (Realizing Jerry's cue) Stacey! (Walks over to Stacey)
Gee, that's-that's too bad.
(breaks a long silence) The uh, the shoe laces that you bought me, they uh, they worked out well. (thumbs up)
(Angered) Fine. I'll ask you again when you're rested.
How you doing?
Of course I'm back. Why wouldn't I be back? My mother's in the hospital, I'm going to pay her a visit.
Well, what's so great about a Mom and Pop store? Let me tell you something. If my Mom and Pop ran a store, I wouldn't shop there.
Five' eight! Five' seven!
It says that on the computer?
Hmm. Really? Nothing?
(aggravated) Oh, that's not good enough! You don't try and de-sour. You have to sweeten too!
Im outta there. I did it! Its over.
I don't wanna tell you how to run your show.
It'll have to be a night job anyway. You don't normally work after dinner, do you?
You can see the Cayman Islands in there? Is something going to happen to me? What?
Here we are.
(glances upwards) Yeah. Uhm, why did she die so young?
I know Jerry. He has this phobia about public toilets. I think we really should go upstairs.
Yeah haha.
91 dollars.
It's a huge problem, Jerry. The hardest part about having sex with a woman is getting her to come back to your place! He's already got that.
Oh no, I can't do it. I-I'm not good at these things, I get flustered. Once I tried to bribe an usher at the roller derby, I almost got arrested.
Right, right.
A garden! I cant believe theres a garden!
I won't be able to, concentrate in front of you.
No, you didn't mention it.
Oh yeah the nipple. But besides that. How did you feel about Kramer's work?
So?
Oh.
All right, I'll tell you what... why don't you go into the store and I'll wait in the car?
No, that's a fair question. It is, uhm... (nervous chuckle) Jerry, yeah. (to Cynthia) Jerry's a friend of mine. (to Russell) He uh, he gave it to me. Unbelievable how many addresses of people this guy has.
I tried to tear it from the side, you can't get a good grip here. You gotta do it like a bag of chips.
Were dying here!
(answers phone, good mood) Hey.
You know how hot it gets there? Like 150 degrees. Your skin is gonna be simmering with boils.
So, if Susan and I had... I mean, if the envelopes hadn't, uh... then we--
She invites me up at twelve oclock at night, for coffee, and I dont go up. No thank you. I dont want coffee. It keeps me up. Too late for me to drink coffee. I said this to her. People this stupid shouldnt be allowed to live. I cant imagine what she must think of me.
Piece of cake; hu.
(Smiling) Nothing.
When?
Oh my God...You're in jail? (Celia nods.) That is so cool!
Fine. Steal the battery. Now, all right, here is the Frogger. This is the front door, and this is the outlet.
Excuse me...huh... I think I made a big mistake. I'd like my deposit back please.
And, Ill have a club soda with no ice.
Is she socially awkward?
Weren't you supposed to call Elaine?
(leaving) That'll do.
Jerry? I have to tell you something. This is the dullest moment Ive ever experienced.
Shoplifting.
Oh my god....
What, it didn't bother her?
Oh, god. Look who's here.
Yes I did.
look at this guy. Does he have to stretch in here?
It was.
(Eating a sandwich) Oh, like you really know busboys.
Ok, it's a deal!
(in his mind) I think that ginger ale at the coffee shop is just Coke and Sprite mixed together. How can I prove it? Ah! Can't, dammit. (knock at door. George goes to open it)
That's okay. That's good. You think Louie Pasteur and his wife had anything in common? He was in the fields all day with the cows, you know with the milk, examining the milk, delving into milk, consummed with milk. Pasteurization, Homogenization, She was in the kitchen killing cockroaches with a boot on each hand.
So, you were saying how, um...about the script...
I cant believe I won at Inka-dink.
Never mind.
(Mutters) Oh.. okay.. talk to you later.
Huh, No kidding?
Of course, not as exciting as miss crop circles, but...
You open the door to the car, boom, you walk right into the hospital. Eh, You can't beat that spot. (starts doing a little dance) I am on a roll. I'm just willing these great parking spots.
Why didn't you take your car?
Yeah. Hey, let ask you something. Is it just me, or - or do you find it unbearable to be around Jerry and that girl?
What TV Guide?
They wanted to read a Truman Capote book.
Well whad you buy it for?
Good morning, sir.
No, the cushion's turned over.
Oh, that would be wonderful.
No.
Why didn't you just tell her?
The tag, huh?
These are the balloons? Big deal, all I see is Woody Woodpecker.
(annoyed) Not a peep. They just cleaned the carpets and left. Call themselves a cult!
That, or Whos bra is this?
Hey-- (spots Donna)
What's with the gloves?
Four hours.
No details?
It's mellifluous!
Ah ah Pez dispenser.
I got up, I was supposed to go to work, I came here instead.
Well, at the Yankees it was all about smoothing things over, you know, chiseling away, grinding down. In fact we used to call it 'the grind'.
Do you feel funny? He didn't say anything.
Ewings hurt? How long is he going to be out?
So, you didn't think this was a date?
alright alright
I gave her a twenty, she only gave me change for a ten.
She doesn't Want to talk, she needs to talk.
(worried) Alright, alright. Look, we're people, you and me, huh? Businessmen. Colleagues, if I may. Let's not quibble. We'll do it for the thirteen thousand. Thirteen thousand, and I never came up here, we never talked, alright. You take good care. (moving past Russell toward the door) It was nice seeing you again, and nice meeting you. (to Cynthia) Cynthia, right?
(on a pay phone) Hey, hey, it's George, I need ya to do me a favor.
I should've hit the little son-of-a-bitch. I can't stand kids. Adults think it's so wonderful how honest kids are. I don't need that kind of honesty. I'll take a deceptive adult over an honest kid any day.
You saw who, what?
Really!
Very nice Tom, that was terrific.
She asked about me? What did- What did she say?
I...was trying to lead the way. We needed a leader! Someone to lead the way to safety.
(ahem) In this age of uncertainty and confusion, a man begins to ask himself certain questions. How can one even begin to put into words something so um (trying to think of a word)
Please. They dont do anything. Look, do I have to break up with her in person? Cant I do it over the phone? I-I have no stomach for these things.
What happens to charter tickets when you don't use em?
This is not good. This is not good.
Kramer was on Murphy Brown? That son of a gun!
All right. I will see you boys later.
I don't know.. you and Susan Davis?
Elaine could be a character. Kramer..
Sorry, the card says Moops.
Damn you, laser guy! You had to grab it all with your lowbrow laser shtick! You're just a prop comic! Where's the craft?!
Wow, Keith Hernandez. He's such a great player.
Nothing!
Diane DeConn? You saw Diane DeConn!
Phil, I loved those cigars! Incoming! (Flicks his card tward Phil)
(animated) Then I'm going to Mars!
Well what do you eat?
No, no, no. He just left.
(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o Kramer!
Sstill love. Still love.
Alright, now you're gonna see some parallel parking. (spitting into his hands and rubbing them together) How I wish you could make a living parallel parking. (turning around in his seat) It's all geometry, knowing all the angles, when to make that first turn and then when to swing it back in, that's the key.
So they're flying the tiny instruments in from El Paso.
(laughs) Yeah, it's me. Is this Clayton?
Of course. Your massage. (winks) Enjoy your massage. (winks)
Yeah, he once bumped into reverend Yung Sun Moon.
(sobbing) yodel lay hee hoo..
What, I can't stop by and visit my parents? (Drops pamphlet on coffee table)
I-I don't know.
Hey pop, would you buzz off, I've got something cooking.
(identifying it) Wrath of Khan!
I didn't get the special, but I'd also like the fresh fruit too.
I didn't say 'We're Ted Danson.'
No, it's doing the same thing to someone that they did to you.
You're sleepin' with the maid?
Hunh, pph (raises hands slightly, in amazement) How was it?
Yes. I like to feel cozy. I have a very small apartment. I like to feel tucked in, nestled in. Love to be nestled.
I dont understand why you spend time with this guy.
Oh, shhh.
Aw c'mon. It's a fantastic name. It's a real original, nobody else is gonna have it and I absolutely love it.
Now I know what I am supposed to do. It's so simple. Tell the truth That's all. Just tell the truth
Ha, ha ha uh, I'm not following that.
Yes! And I put him up to it, because I'm sick! I'm the one that needs help.
Oh, yeah, me too, me too. Boy oh boy oh boy...! You know, in fact, I've been thinking about it, and I feel like I'm stealing from you! Five-hundred dollars! It's gonna be worth thousands soon! You know what? On second thought, I can't even accept it.
Water coolers?
Oh boy.
Do you think chickens have individual personalities?
Jerry did you wash this pear?
[furious] Good. It's good to be accurate like that.
How's your life? All right?
Yeah.
(cheerful) Alright, there you go. She's gonna get the jacket back. (claps hands) So, let's go get some coffee, huh?
Magic time.
Now?
(coming back to the table from the bathroom) Oh uh. You ready?
Yeah, (cough) Definite smoke.
It's impossible. I got him a wake up service.
Thats my candy line-up! Where are all my cards?! Theyre - theyre all on the floor!
Come on now.
Did you get the shot?
It's not that easy. It's like "Beat The Clock," there's a lot of pressure there.
Sure. (Turns around.)
Susan, why?
Oh, no, no--
Tough.
Oh No nonono I'm not a cop ...Heum... I work for the Yankees.
Why not?
Well, if he can regift, why can't you degift?
Well, I could be a little sweetie tweetie weetie weetie.
It's all politics.
Oh! That's good judgment. That's a pile of judgment there. Sure.
Yeah.
So I said, "Mr. Hayman, It's me george Costanza, JFK, ... " He doesn't move. So I said uh, "Can't stand ya'", "Can't stand ya'" He turns and smiles, the little baked bean teeth. I get up to run away, but something was holding me back. It was Heyman. He had my underwear. There I was on the steps of the 42nd St. library , a grown man, getting a wedgie.
Good. Cause if this is a lie, if this is a joke, if this is your idea of some cute little game we're finished!
Wait a minute, that is my apartment. I earned it with 34 years of misery!
Would you mind helping me out with some of this stuff?!?
Well, I told it to Susan before, and she didn't like it.
Happy? Why should I be happy?
How'd you hook up with these guys?
Well, he said it could be cancer, maybe you should get it checked out.
What for?
Have a good time.
(Defensively) Whatever.
(shouts) You be nice!
What about these?
No, no, no, no, Im It. I win.
You nervous?
Well, it's this little place with this little bathroom. It's like right there, you know, it's not even down a little hall or off in an alcove. You understand? There's no... buffer zone. So, we start to fool around, and it's the first time, and it's early in the going. And I begin to perceive this impending... intestinal requirement, whose needs are going to surpass by great lengths anything in the sexual realm. So I know I'm gonna have to stop. And as this is happening I'm thinking, even if I can somehow manage to momentarily... extricate myself from the proceedings and relieve this unstoppable force, I know that that bathroom is not gonna provide me with the privacy that I know I'm going to need...
I think that's mine.
You think I should come clean? What d'you think, you think I Should confess?
Then, the last person to leave is Wilhelm. He sees my car, he figures I'm burning the midnight oil. Between the two of them, they think I'm working an 18 hour day! (he stands there with his hands on his hips, a wide grin - laughing.)
Going backstage is the worst. Especially when they stink. You know that's a real problem.
Should I not go on this trip?
(trying to laugh it off) Right. C'mon! I'm having an affair with Elaine?! If I was having an affair with Elaine, I wouldn't tell you I'm going to see Elaine. I would make up some other person to tell you I was gonna go see, and then I would go see Ela..Elaine.
So uh... been to a bris before?
I couldn't. You know, if it's not about sports, I find it very hard to concentrate.
Why can't we share?
I, uh...figure it's something. (Kramer enters.)
What are you doing?
You know. You use the, uh...(mutters something unintelligible under his breath.)
This. Just talking.
Well, I took the liberty of packing your things. (gleeful) Mom's coming to get you.
you better be careful on those rocks tomorrow buddy. And you're not getting any sandwiches either
I cant stand doing laundry. Thats why I have forty pairs of underwear.
Really?
(panicked and rushed) Jerry! The Japanese guys had sake in the hot-tub! You gotta get 'em outta the drawers and get 'em down here, or I don't have a focus group to sell the pilot to Japanese TV!
(Annoyed) There's more.
Take a wild guess.
What do you mean, like him?
I've been standing here for the last ten minutes!
Haaaaaa!!!
I bought a new recliner with a fridge build right in to it.
My god!!!
I am ready.
Sounds like a cool guy.
Oh, wait, isn't scalping illegal?
Why not?
What are you? Satan? I'm close to a job here. It's my second interview with them.
Yeah. It doesn't make any difference.
You see. You see! Listen when is your next drawing class?
(Sarcastic) Maybe for her new performance piece she'll give birth on stage.
Still marry , still marry.
You know, I have to tell you something. You couldn't get me on a plane right now. I get those FAA reports directly. My uncle sends them to me, he used to be a pilot, so. Big investigation in the, uh, what's the word there, uh, offing. It's in the offing. But, you know, you shouldn't let that stop you from going. You could go. I don't mind.
Where are you!
I never heard of that.
And I am not a piece of toast.
Ssssso, after me, you... went that way?
The guy who pitched him the show with the stories about nothing. (snaps fingers) Jerry Seinfeld. Jerry Seinfeld's friend.
C'mon, funny is funny.
Bother, wa', what kind of bother?
Yeah, yeah.
Tell me your impressions, I would love to hear what a young woman thinks of "The Big Game".
Jiffy Park. It's incredible.. Seventy-five dollars a month.
Can't hurt you.
Can we move on?
I made a mistake.
I have to have my tonsils taken out.
We'll have 2 slices and 2 grape sodas.
Oh, no. We left on good terms.
Very nice
Ah, well, that's very mature. What about you?
(smiling) I'm on a winning ball club, Jerry. They probably wanna pick my brains.
Really? Because people do meet in places besides a bar, huh?
Whe ... Well yeah!
You know, Ive been thinking. I cannot envision any circumstances in which Ill ever have the opportunity to have sex again. Hows it gonna happen? I just dont see how it could occur.
That's what I want.
I'd like to hear that.
So it's just mono.
Uh, can we cut to the chase?
Mrs. Sweedler thank you. Y-You see, this tragedy affected me in a very, very personal way.
I know that's why I bought `em but they're not comfortable.
Well, I am just a T-bone kinda guy. Love that T-bone. In fact, you might as well call me--
Sometimes, once in a while.
Remember, dont take any crap.
Wait a second, wait a second, what coming in, what woman is coming in?
Ohhhh...
Its your apartment!
What?
Well played.
Oh that's eh, that's a sandwich.
Yes.
(using the phone) Watch how it's done. Oh, hello, Mr. Vandelay? Would you like to buy a computer? Oh, really? Two dozen?
I-I-I-I-I got it!!!!!
Just enjoying watching you.
Hi, how are ya? (They kiss)
I'm an architect.
I don't know, it sounds like pigeons or something!
Exactly, you know what I'm talking about, right?
(Boiling) What am I going to say?!
Well, I started to tell her and then all of the sudden, for some reason, I just burst into tears.
Yes it is.
Yeah. Hey Jerry, listen to this. I discovered something even better than conjugal visit sex. Fugitive sex! Now, it's like everytime -
Are you coming back down?
You got your own shampoo, conditioner, body lotion! Jerry, body
(Losing it) I guess everyone here enjoys giving the old screwgie, huh?! Youre all doin a hell of a job! (Looks longingly at the Twix in the machine) Ho, ho. What I would do with you..
(shouting) What happened to Soda?! I thought we all agreed on Soda.
Yeahhh.
I know, they're out of their minds! It's fantastic!
(feigning excitement) Great, great. O-Oh, oh, oh, gosh. You know, it's just... my duties with the Yankees...
MOOPS,
Nothing.
That's what she says. I say, listen. It was an old cat. It died of natural causes. So get this, now she tells me that I gotta buy her a brand new cat. I say listen, honey. First of all, it was a pretty old cat. I'm not gonna buy you a brand new cat to replace an old dying cat. And second of all, I go out to the garbage, I find you a new cat in fifteen seconds. I say, you show me an autopsy report that says this cat died of starvation, I spring for a new cat. So she says something to me, like, uh, I dunno, get the hell out of here, and she breaks up with me. Now don't you think that would be a great case on L.A. Law?
Hey, Nina! (beat) I owe you some money, don't I?
I climbed out the window.
(doing the voice) La la la.
So, what're you saying?
I've seen squeeze mustard. I've never seen squeeze ketchup.
You knew? How did you know?
Why? What's wrong with the subject? This is a bad subject?
Okay.
Want a bite?
(frantic) Oh, Jerry Jerry Jerry Jerry Jerry, listen, if, if you are feeling uncomfortable about this at all, at all. Do not feel like you have to take it.
What're you doing? What're you, telling secrets? What're you laughing at?
The one who always sits by herself?
Willie. Yeah.
He wants to talk about "Jerry"?
Hey-hay! Lloyd! Hey! My friend Jerry eh.
(smiling) That is really nice.
Outside of Manhattan, about an hour ago.
I think it moved. Oh my god, I think it moved. Yeah, give me the big piece. I'll see you later.
(through a mouthful) Long as they don't throw 'em on the field. (laughs) Huhu. (indicating dish) Help yourself to some shrimp, I brought enough for everybody.
What? You can't leave yet.
This is for you.
(to Jerry) Hey.
Nice.
Oh no no no, if you must know, I would rather be with her than go to the game.
Yes. And listen to this, listen to this; her uncle works for the Yankees and he's gonna get me a job interview. A front office kind of thing. Assistant to the traveling secretary. A job with the New York Yankees! This has been the dream of my life ever since I was a child, and it's all happening because I'm completely ignoring every urge towards common sense and good judgment I have had. This is no longer just some crazy notion. Elaine, Jerry, this is my religion.
Geez.
I said, do you like ice?
So you could call a woman for a date, ask her if she's free for Dinner and a flamenco?
(picking up what Frank saw as a mouse) It's the remote.
Listen, maybe we shouldn't start writing today. I got a lot on my mind.
(The damage has been done. He is slightly angered at Jerry) May I ask, what do you read in the bathroom?
Oh no no no no, don't say anything to Kramer. Susan can't stand him. He vomited all over her.
Sorry, the players will be reimbursed?
Susan wants me to be there.
I'm very disappointed to here you talk like that. You still don't know what makes me tick.
Well, you know, to be honest sir -- my, my new secretary Ade, came up with that one.
Yeah. Good weekend.
All right, shmoopies...what's it gonna be? Pick a theater.
This is a cartoon!
Is that right? I just threw away a lifetime of guilt-free sex, and floor seats for ever sporting event in Madison Square Garden. So please, a little respect. For I am Costanza Lord of the Idiots!
Yeah, yeah, she's here.
May I just use your bathroom for a moment?
Look, I have my system. First I look for the dream spot right in front of the door, then I slowly expand out in concentric circles.
Latvia?
What should I do?
Why?
Listen, sweetheart, let me tell you a little something about guts. (Points to his head.) This is guts.
You have to drink that whole thing?
It's a spanish dish. It's a moulage of fish, an meat with rice. Very tasty.
Excuse me. I believe you just ate my Twix bar. It was dangling. And when you purchased your Twix bar, you got a little freebie, and you never bothered to ask why, or seek out its rightful owner.
No..
Well, we.. we, we, ah..
(inhales deeply) I tell you, Jerry, I'm feeling something. Something I haven't felt in a long time.
That's unbelievable!
(motioning Jerry to follow) C'mon.
Me? I didn't say anything.
But my friend here has hypothermia.
Ma, will you stop?... Its just a statue!... How is it my fault?!... It was stolen. I didnt even touch it this time... Okay, fine... I dont see why this should affect to potatoes!... Okay... Goodbye. (George hangs up.) She doesnt react to disappointment very well. Unlike me.
You know, like all the comedians always say, 'How would you like it if I came to where you work and heckled you?'
Who?
(sighs) Guess not. What should I do?
Mine!
If I could talk to the guy for just a sec...
I don't know what you're getting all riled up about. There are probably a million Costanzas-
(Annoyed) Frog is wrong.
(Outraged) "That's all"?! That's everything! I don't know what all the rest of it is for anyway!
My tonsils? Yeah, when I was a kid.
The next morning, I woke up, and it was going like this. (moves his arm slowly) I can control it if I really concentrate. But otherwise, (arm moves) oh.
What was wrong with that? I had a different interpretation! Do you know anything about this pretzel guy?! Maybe he's been in the bar a really long time and he's really depressed because he has no job and no woman and he's parking cars for a living! (out the window to honking cars) Alright! Alright! Shut up! Shut up! I hear you! I'm coming down! These pretzels are making me thirsty!
Finicky? Prissy? Fastidious?
You're smart, I'm dumb.
Oh, real good. (George makes a face like you stink) Any word from NBC?
Ah, would you take this picture away from me. Take it away and get it outta here. Let me just sign this and go.
So you don't think she really has a boyfriend?
Oh, no, that's just the old, uh, the old handicap acting up.
hey
Is it about me?
What...are you using my babies now?
All right, let me ask you something When do you start to worry about ear hair?
Lyndon Johnson was uglier than Degaulle.
(delighted) Jerry? It was incredible! Models! As far as the eye could see!
All right, listen, I'll see you guys later.
Really? Coco?
My Darling Susan! My DARLING!!!
Yes, inte-- h-how inte-- how integral?
Youre gonna be neighbors.
Oh. Okay, here it is, I got it. She lost her thumbs in a tractor accident and they grafted her big toes on. They do it every day.
They are?... Elaine?
No, no. I'm not going on.
Lemme tell you something, that Jerry Lewis? You wonder how some of these people get to the top? It's ideas like this! Brilliant! Hah-hah! (Notices that the briefcase is damaged.) Look at this - what the hell happened? The whole side is damaged here...and the lock is broken.
What for?
Wow! The weekend.
Well I I ..put a lot of thought into this and I think I would like you to sign a prenuptual agreement.
This is the life! Isn't it, huh, kid?
Jerry, . . .
Uh huh.
(Embarrassed) That's all I could find. (A moment passes) Would you mind getting the door?
Uh huh. Uh huh! I think you spoke to your little friend Rachel, that's what I think.
Well, why would the guy make up something like that? Of all the names he could pick, why settle on Jon Voight?
. . . WELL IT WAS A BIG SALAD. AND WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IS, HOW DOES A PERSON WHO HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE BIG SALAD CLAIM RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT SALAD AND ACCEPT THE THANK YOU UNDER FALSE PRETENSES - AH - AH?
Hey.
You are!
You know, you're nuts with these sponges. George is gettin' frustrated!
Really?
Bye, Dolores.
What's casus belli.
So what happened?
Me neither.
She said looks aren't important to her?
Uh, well, you know,...
Y'know, I'm better with the mothers than I am with the daughters.
(pops his head out of the covers, looking a bit confused) Uh...you know, uh...pleasuring you.
(picking up his coat) Awright, I'm heading home.
I did it! It's all done!
Tell her about the shoving.
Why don't we get them a couch? (Kramer laughs) Well rent a U-haul -- well bring em a nice sectional.
(singing) Meet the Mets...
"....I like spicy chicken"
Sure, well uh, you know I'll check in with you next week uh, I gotta run now because I got a full plate this afternoon. All right, really go to uh,.
I been, uh, thinking about the family. Tell me, uh, about Aunt Baby.
Unbelievable, I'm never gonna get out of here. The guy goes to pee, he never comes back. It's like a science fiction story.
What happened to you?
Its unbelievable. You know what else is unbelievable? I picked up the check. She didnt even offer. She ended it. The least she could do is send me off with a sandwich.
I'm grotesque . I look like a troll.
Wait a minute, call the car phone, see what happens.
Yes, now. It's gonna take a few days and my parents are gonna be back. I gotta have it back before them!
Well ordinarily I wouldn't mind. But...
I got nothing.
Maybe it's some small thing I could change. Like a moustache. Or wearing a top hat, or a monocle, or a..or a cane.
No, that's right, I didn't. I take full responsibility for the card not being here. I, uh, . . .
(thoughtful) Yes. Yes.
So?
No, no. I'm just thinking.
It's just that I was the one who actually paid for the big salad. She just happened to hand it to you. But it's no big deal.
Not a plane crash. (leaving) Is it a plane crash?
(Gesturing to Jerry) Check the raiser.
So, what, no lunch?
Wednesday? That's your personal business?! (stalks over to the counter) Skiing?! (angry) So let people suffer, while you're shushing all over a mountain?
You fixed me up with a bald woman.
Hey, you gotta take a ride with me later. I borrowed my father's car. '68 GTO.
Alrighty. Ah ... my last job was in publishing ... I uh got fired for having sex in my office with the cleaning woman.
Keith, Keith Wa What happened? Where's Keith?
What about a rec room? Huh? Or a community center.
Nothing really, you know...just eh, stroll around the cell blocks, maybe eh, take in a shower fight. (chuckles.) Hey eh, you know you got a bounced check hanging up in the little market over on Columbus?
She confused "six" with "sex"?
Oh, no no no. I was just looking for stock-pages. Here it is. Looking for the quotes. Gotta check to quotes. Love a good quote. Oh, IBM up a quarter.
No. I am not giving my code to anyone for any reason.
Coffees coffee in the morning. Its not coffee at twelve oclock at night.
Yes, well you see, the deceased landed on my car. The uh splat, as it were, actually occurred on the roof of my car. Now of course I can't help but feel that had it been a convertible this whole tragedy might have been averted but I've never been the kind of guy to buy a convertible, what with the baldness and everything.
What trying to get off the phone?
What happened to the screen door? It blew off again?
How come this sweater is only 85 dollars?
What kind of plastic do you think it is? What do you think like that dry cleaning plastic?
So, what did she say?
Yeah.
Jerry! Hey, that's the guy!
Really?
Hi.
Day was -
Sure. I could go the tomato route. But eh, I've given this a lot of thought Jerry. All that frustration. Ill never get any work done. So Im doing a complete 360. Im going for total efficiency and ability.
Well if you and I ever got into, like a really serious fight you know, and the punches started flying -- who do you think would win?
(again from bathroom) Witness.
Not even an apple.
I never heard of anyone would turned down an apartment because of a weak shower spray.
You can't - huhu, All right let's go.
No. I need a guy that can rig a Frogger machine so that I can move it without losing power, 'cause I have the high score. H-hello?
Yeah?
I used to share that same outlook. But now, I have so many things to occupy my mind. For instance, the atom.
What d'you mean, let 'em go? They're spending all my money.
Whoa, whoa, you're not getting in my car with gummy shoes.
Really?
This was supposed to be 'The summer of George'! The summer of George.
(joyful) June. It's June.
Hey, it's George. Listen, I-
I couldn't help it! Elaine moved the mirror, I got discombobulated.
(from the street below Jerry's window) Jerry!
I got a date with Karen. I don't know what I'm gonna do. Nothing happening down there.
You can't handle the truth! (he salutes) (imitating Jack Nicholson [a.k.a. Col. Nathan R. Jessep], from the 1992 movie A Few Good Men)
He has no home. He's a squirrel.
A stock.
Oh, uh, the cigars.. (Chuckles nervously) I'm, uh, suckin' 'em down. I'm puffing my brains out, yeah.
Oh, that's bad. That's bad.
Who's Bozo? Bozo the Clown, that's who Bozo is. When I was a kid, Bozo the Clown was the clown, bar none.
.....So what's your point?
Twelve dollars? I knew we should have gone to the bakery. I guarantee you theyre not getting no twelve dollar cake.
You know, I could have actually gone to that.
What for?
Nevertheless. His time has come.
Ya, sure sure.
Oh. I know they have some monies.
We got a chocolate malt in here!
[to himself] Oh, my God! It's Susan! What do I do?
So you're on the speed dial?
Do you think she gets to take any of those little bars of soap home?
(Only turning back for a second) Hey.
Now Peterman wants me to go to the funeral.
(thoughtful) I have no idea.
That was an honest mistake.
(Hands Antonio a card) Here's my card. I'm in real estate, so, if you're ever looking for something bigger, something nicer.. (Antonio is staring at him, angered) ..maybe not right now. Anyway.. (Extends his hand for a handshake. Antonio doesn't move)
Barry?
What are you gonna do?
Right.
I hate him!
It strikes me a lot of guys are doing that kind of humor now.
(Yelling out) It's my apartment, Eldridge! The Stalkholm may not have sunk ya, but I will! Ha, ha, ha!
You know, I haven't eaten anything.
Oh.
(Laughs) You, I guess, you don't remember me.. but we actually, kind of um.. went out.. a couple of years ago.. once.. remember?
The show will be like a heart attack!
What about me?
Big fan! Big fan.
What? I don't see anything.
Yeah, she's a sweet ride.
You mean one of those vinyl things?
Yes! How're we gonna do that?
(NOT INTERESTED) Really.
No. No. No. No. No. Don't worry. It's perfectly safe. I researched it. He'll get a little woozy. He might keel over.
So in order to use these, I gotta spend like fifteen-hundred bucks. This is a bill for fifteen-hundred dollars. Plus, she'd ask about the sleeping arrangements, that whole sleeping arrangement conversation is depressing.
Yes, two solariums. Quite a find. And I have horses, too?
(laughing) You think you're going to the other side with "Hi"? You're not going to make it.
Yeah, I know that. (clears throat) Could you start, working?
Like you do.
Yes, Mr. Hayman
What happened to the raisins?
But I had no... I didn't realize.
Keep going.
(trying again with Glenda) I'm gonna count to three. If you don't give up the chair, the wig is coming off.
Koko.
Yes. Changes.
Nah, I'm good.
You just said you weren't tucking.
How so?
No, Julie, Julie, don't insult me. You know, what difference does it make who pays for lunch. It's totally meaningless.
What about accommodations?
(as Jerry and Elaine continue to whine) Give it! Give it! (he finally gets the remote away from them) Pinheads.
Oh, no, nothing.
(continuing) I feel like a family. In fact, yesterday was Grace's birthday. She's such a sweet woman so, we had a little party, with cake and champagne. I made a toast.
No its a regular religion.
Wa, I'm not getting out of this cab
How as the date?
Yes!
Jerry it's funny, Paula and I actually met because of Elaine.
No. No it's not. You don't know this guy. It woulda been so sweet.
Well, of course they're trying to screw you. What do you think? That's what they do. They can make up anything. Nobody knows. "By the way, you need a new Johnson rod in there." "Oh, a Johnson rod. Yeah, well, you better put one of those on."
Look at that. Theyre done!
I can't eat this without catsup. Would it kill her to check up on us? Would that be a terrible thing? "How's everything? Do you need anything? What can I do for you?"
"Sir?"
Maybe I could call my father.
Could we talk about this some other time?
Well, yeah.
Dad, the hinges are all rusted here. That's why the wind keeps blowing the door off.
Assistant to the travelling secretary. (fishing for a reaction) I'm uh, working on the project.
Well you know what happens with larvae hatch, they-they're everywhere.
Pasta primavera?
I'll tell you what's wrong, a grown woman with a male roommate! It's unnatural, it's an abomination!
(quietly) ehh. (pausing to look at both of them) So what made you change your mind?
Take it easy. Take it easy. It's not the end of the world.
The cabin.. (Laughs nervously) Well.. (Pauses as he thinks of a way to break the news, then decides to pass it off) Susan?
what are you doing here?
What's a three letter word for candy?
(screaming) Aaahh!!
Yes, sure, surely was. Yeah, I'll remember that day. Well I'll never forget it because that was the day that I uh, lost my virginity to Miss. Stafford, the uh, voluptuous home room teacher.
25? You don't have anything higher?
Would you like a Pepto-Bismol? I keep them in my wallet...! (Russell goes into the bathroom and shuts the door.) (To Jerry) Do you think he liked it? (From the bathroom, we hear Russell violently heaving his guts.)
So what? Somebody dropped an egg on my head as I went into my building last night.
Oh my!
Okay.
What's she like? Impressive?
Hello, Lloyd. How you doing?
What happened to you?
You don't speak *any* English?
It's effeminate to sit like this?
Hey hey hey, we're in a rush here.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's in the vault. I'm putting it in the vault.
It's, uh, it's not a little chicken. (laughing) Little chicken. It's a gamebird.
Just dropped in for a visit. You, uh, you never called me back.
(worried now) No sir.
I'm gonna hit the head.
Good....good day (not too convincing) You?
You see, you see? I see things as they are and I say, 'no!' Uh, wait, you see things as they are not and you s- Wait, uh, you see things, do you see things as they are? What do you say when you see things?
Does that mean I have to go too?
All right! Come on! Let's not fight.
Oh, yeah, sure. Keep your money.
She hasnt eaten in two days.
How are we gonna get out of here? They'll kill us!
Yes they did. I was covering. Elaine has been deported back to Scotland.
You just hesitated.
Oh, yes. I already packed up my desk, sir. I can be outta here in an hour.
All right here you go.
I would like to dip my bald head in oil and rub it all over your body. [No reaction] You don't understand! It's a miracle! You don't understand because you don't speak English!
No!
Okay, so you remember I made the initial call Sunday, she doesnt call back. I call again Monday, I leave another message. I call Tuesday, I get the machine again, I know youre there, I dont know what your story is. Yesterday, Im a volcano  I try one more call, the machine comes on, and I let fly like Mussolini from the balcony, Where the hell do you get the nerve? You invite me up for coffee and then you dont call me back for four days? I dont like coffee, I dont have to come up. Id like to get one more shot at the coffee just so I could spit it in your face.
...What?
Woah, I gotta watch this guy's bag.
What about jewelry? That's very nice gift.
I tell you, when she threw that toupee out the window, it was the best thing that ever happened to me. I feel like my old self again. Totally inadequate, completely insecure, paranoid, neurotic, it's a pleasure.
(turning to each other) I dont know. Hes an importer.
Yeah, he's right.
All day. ( phone rings , Jerry picks up)
Like that?
I can't run, I have a bad hamstring.
In motion. The wheels are in motion.
No.
Alright. 7,7, (points at himself) 6. I'm not gonna eat that much!
Let me ask you something. What do you think of this shirt?
That's dynamite. Yeah, I'll look for the Chinese food leftovers.
Maybe hes resting.
I'm bootleggin' a movie, baby!
Oh I was not. The BUBBLE BOY was tried to kill me.
Tuesday? I can't do it Tuesday. Steinbrenner needs me to run---
No, no, pff...
No! My ticket?! You gave my ticket to Horneck?
Of course not! Wash it, dry it, move on!
Look it's no secret what's going on between us. (to Jerry) She doesn't like me. Now Jerry if you don't mind.
Thank you very much. (Walks out)
Youre doomed. Youre gonna have to have all your sex at womens apartments. Itll be like a permanent road trip. Forget about the home bed advantage.
Do you know what happens if I miss him? I don't get credit for the pickup and I lose my 50 bucks...
Well that was a really stupid thing! You know what's going to happen now?
I can't believe that you saw her before me.
Oh, no. No no no no no. Id have to advise against that. What, do you know this woman a month? Lets see, youre going to be with her seventy-two hours. Thats a dating decathlon.
Okay, uh, eighteen dollars, and there it is. There you go. So maybe we could get together this weekend.
Kramer, I can't help you. You're gonna have to get them some place else.
Ever since I found out that you let that message on Jerry's tape recorder I...
Still lookin'. It's pretty bad out there. What about you?
All right, what are we doing?
Yeah, so you gotta use something else.
Allison! Hi! Oh, my God! How are you?
What if I'm at the bottom?
Should I take some?
I'm interviewing all these annoying little overachievers.. finally, this kid walks in - Steven Koren - a regular guy.. likes sports.. watches T.V..
Absolutely. Pending approval of the script.
You saw Jane topless?
Well, You're not gonna believe it...
(Showing Jerry the menu) "Chef recommends"
The Ray Conniff Singers. (nervous chuckle)
Its George.
Why?
Yes, yes of course. The Pensky file. Ho ho, can't wait to sink my teeth into that. Wow that Pensky. Well we'll straighten him out.
I think I may be in love with this woman.
Hmm-hmm, not by a long shot. I'm calling up the Rosses and inviting them up to my non-existent place in the Hamptons. Then we'll see who blinks first.
Yeah, well, she's trying to track you down.
Too flashy?
Maybe.
I can do hard time for this one. And community service!
I get the feeling when lesbians are looking at me, they're thinking "That's why I'm not heterosexual".
Yeah.
You are not gonna believe whats going on with this woman.
All right I gotta get going.
I had a feeling you would like it. No, don't try it on now, try it on later.
No, no, no, this suit is not for sale. (tries to take off the suit from the guy)
Why didn't you just wear a heavier coat?
It's one think to not give me the extension But to tease and to torture me like this. There's no call for that.
Yes ... yes, yes
Because he's afraid she's gonna get hurt.
Why did France give that to us anyway?
We get to go to the opera together!
(entering) Last night, huh? Was that something, or was that something?
Let's test him. Hey, driver. What do you say we stop off, pick up your sister, have a little fun back here? No, he can't hear us.
I'll fight ya! Not the face! Not the face! (The struggle continues.)
What are they gonna do?
Ok, thanks.
I'll take care of this, Danny.
Oh, this guy tried to sneak into my space.
Yeah, 5A!
Oh. This I need. Hello!! Hello. i..i..is this the hair restoration clinic? ...Does anyone speak English?
C-Communist? I am a Yankee, sir, first and foremost.
(shouting) Get your Paliachi!
And then, (Smacks the money) there were two.
Yes a cruise, a long cruise, just the two of you.
He wants to meet you? I'll tell you what. I'll show up. He doesn't know we're friends. I'll pretend I haven't seen you since High School. I'll back up the story.
Thank you very much. You just stand over there, I?ll stand over here.
All right. Okay, tell me what you think about this idea Extend the doors on the toilet stalls at Yankee Stadium all the way to the floor.
(Looking at his finger) I think somethin bit me. I just need another nickel.
To be polite. I rest my case.
All right, believe me, you're not going to marry him.
Deeply in love. If you can't say anything bad about a relationship, you shouldn't say anything at all.
What?
Feel? What's that?
Oh, the actress-waitress?
With extreme prejudice.
Mario's Pizza.
(To the man behind him in line) Yeah, right Im gonna get my car repaired at a dealership. Huh! Why dont I just flush my money down the toilet?
(astounded) What? So, this is still not over?
Fantastic day! Fantastic!
Well a lot of people consider me small and prestigious.
Depends on what?
All right, stop it! Stay away from my breasts! Chest!
Don't you see what this is?
This could be in a museum some day! It's not safe with me! It should really be in a doormanned building.
Me neither!
Almost there.
Hey that's swell.
No, I, uh, um, wa, wa, What did I do? ... Where are you going?
(Hangs up phone and pauses) this is great! He fired her! This is incredible, he fired her. I'm out, baby! I'm out!
On-the-street cell-phone call is the lowest phone call you can make.
W-ca-What did they do?
I gotta get out of this city.
What game?
Story.
But really, it's enough with the bar already.
Just walk.
I don't know. I closed my eyes and made a move.
I could never do that. You know the ironic thing is if she had a smaller nose, I never could have gone out with her in the first place. She'd be out of my league with a smaller nose. And I really like her, I know that. And I know one other thing. I'm not getting past that nose.
Heh heh heh hey, new suit (raises coffee cup as a salute / toast)
Hey. How's your day, good?
Yes! Nothing says George like a movie!
Yeah.
I love it! This is fantastic! Look at this couch, is this velvet?!
I believe that I am about to become the target of a systematic process of intimidation and manipulation, the likes of which you have never -
Hey, Jerry, how was Ithaca?
Its a Twix! Theyre all Twix! It was a setup! A setup, I tell ya! And youve robbed it! Youve all screwed me again! Now, gimme one! Gimme a Twix!
Excuse me, the guy is wearing a jacket that my friend is...
Greetings, people. Greetings. Greetings and salutations. What a beautiful day for a ball game. Let's play two! (Sits down, says to waitress ) Oh, I'll have the chicken salad on rye, my usual, you know what I get, darlin'. (Turns to the Gang) So, let's see, I had a little conversation today with Mr Don Mattingly - (to Elaine) he's the first base man.
Well I didn't know you wanted to go to the flea market.
We've just been through this! You don't remember? We just had this exact same conversation a minute ago!
(backing off) Huh? All right, fine.
It's not funny, Elaine.
If you dont say anything I will assume its a plane crash.
No we're not.
What is that?
Kramer!! Kramer no!!
Hey.
Mmm-mm.
Oh, right, right, the intervention. Should we leave?
I can't tell you.
No, I don't have it yet.
Sweetheart, I was exaggerating.
Well she was sending out our wedding invitations.
The Chinese have done it my friend. The Chinese have done it.
Oh, well, don't worry about it -- he's got plenty of money. (spins his chair away from her)
(Also, over his shoulder) Not me.
Listen. Let me ask you something. If you and Mona were ever to... dance, how do you decide who leads? I mean... do you take turns? Do you discuss it beforehand? How does that work?
Alright, alright, I'll go on the date, but that's that.
I read somewhere that this Brentano's is the place to meet girls in New York.
Yeah, she's a B.L.
They were, it's kinda complicated.
Oh, Scott, Scott. He's really great, isn't he?
(to Jerry) What do you mean by that?
You're gonna tell me...or not.
I dunno. I guess I have to wait for her to die.
Yeah, that is odd, isn't it?
Every summer you guys went to camp together. I was jealous. Felt like he was the summer me.
Why should I?
Course, I wouldn't, I mean uh, the guy is uh, well obviously (to Cynthia, as she passes) the guy has his problems.
Beautiful!
$2300.
No, can't say as I did.
Mr.Wilhelm...
Wait a minute? He's picking up the van tonight? This is perfect. I'll drive Rhisa to someplace romantic. Then when my father slides the door open, I'm in the van kissing his brother's daughter.
Not as good. That's when you realize all the money you're losing.
Who's that?
I would? What if something happens?
I got to go.
Love to! (Cracks his knuckles, then winces under the pain)
This is my ketchup. I bought this ketchup just so I could have as much as I want.
I just pray Kruger doesn't realize that it's gone until this guy can fix it up.
No, no, Kurt - wrong attitude. You should be happy now.
Besides, Steven Koren has the highest of aspirations. He wants to be (pauses for effect) an architect.
Yeah, I didn't mean that.
You arms look like something hanging in a kosher deli.
Ah oh? What? What Ah oh?
Hup! Hup!
Mister Fowler, I-I have a squirrel here that is a miracle of modern science! (laughs)
Maybe you said something that offended her.
Hey, can I flip on the siren?
Well, I like to stay in touch with the people.
Oh! Modelling! What's that like? Fun? Ha ha. (to self in head) Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!
Can't we discuss this?
(Not sure what the answer should be) What do you want to hear?
I don't know how a fish could eat laughs.
No, no, the machine'll get it...
(upset) I *told* you the Drake was bad! I hate the Drake!
Can I uh, can I walk you back to work?
Y'know the average life span for an American male is like, 72. You're really... kinda pushin' the envelope there.
You think she should have said something?
Did you say dangerous?
But I mean look at him. He's gotta be on his feet like that all day? That's brutal. I think I'm gonna say something to your uncle.
Well, anything I can do to help, um...she's a wonderful girl. Very smart. Very eh...crafty.
(Annoyingly butting in) Kinda like Superman's fortress of solitude.
Huh... Cape... (turns, distracted, heads slowly towards door) What was a man with a cape doin' with my father?... What was my father doing with a man in a cape?... (opens door) Why a cape? Hmm! (exits)
Get out of here.
I don't want to talk about it.
Yeah, they're not better than me.
Eh eh eh, can't do it, can't do it, sorry, I got a date.
Ahhhhh...
No, no that's ah, that's pie country.
What?
(entering Monk's) Hey.
There are some people in this room who would have been very happy to never see this briefcase again. There are people in this room who think they can destroy other people's property and get away with it. Well, let me tell you something about those people. They weren't counting on this brain! And this tape recorder.
I thought you said he was gonna get a muffin.
Were aware of the proximity to the park, yes.
She told this couple she had an affair with a matador.
Yeah, it's the last one.
I still don't see why I can't ask her about my arm.
What're you gonna do now?
There ya go.
Im keeping it. Im going down with the ship.
Well then she's just a Liar, Isn't she?
Did you dressed nice, did you do it classy?
(To Elaine) Told me the same thing.
So... uh you feel okay about that whole thing... what we do in there... you're generally okay with everything in there?
No. But I was the only one at the table that didn't get violently ill.
I'm not gonna give you my card unless you tell me what it's for!
(leaving) Hah. Good luck.
Hey, Kramer.
You came to see me. I work in the building.
Hey, there's a tomato stand, let's stop, I can get some more.
Come on. Ya wanna go get some lunch?
Why?
Reality tour?
Oh, its a lovely song. (singing) How do you solve a problem like Maria?...
I hate this mall, there are never any spaces here...
That's your boyfriend.
Too much?
I got a source.
How do I know, maybe, you know, maybe she wanted to be polite.
(to Kramer) Ah! You're just the man I'm looking for.
Cross the wires? I can't even make a pot of spaghetti.
No, no. Forget it. I don't want it. Let's just get rid of it.
It became very clear to me sitting out there today, that every decision I've ever made, in my entire life, has been wrong. My life is the complete opposite of everything I want it to be. Every instinct I have, in every of aspect of life, be it something to wear, something to eat ... It's all been wrong. (chuckles) Everywhere.
Supposed to close with the swirl?
Ya
What *kind* of a person are you?
Jerry, let me tell you something, "A man without hand is not a man." I got so much hand I'm coming out of my gloves. I got to thank Kramer.
No.
You know this whole thing never would have happened if you hadn't bailed out on me at the restaurant.
Who paid?
If not mine, whose?
I was just wondering what it was you wanted for dessert.
(humble) Well, if you must know, shhhe, was my fiance, Susan. May she rest in peace.
Don't you see how wrong that is?! Where's your Christmas spirit? And eye for an eye!
(OC) It's George.
Bovary! (points finger again at Jerry)
Huh? You know? Spring. Rejuvenation. Rebirth. Everything's blooming. All that crap.
(While skimming a Monk's menu) You know, I didn't go to the bathroom the entire time we were in India.
That's perfect! He's a zoo guy! He take's care of animals. C-Can I bring the squirrel by?
me too, I am down, I am totally down, mark me down
I'll tell you what I'd like to do. I'd like to replace that rye.
King Edward. (snapping his fingers) King Edward, Jerry.
It wasn't funny.
No, no thanks.
No reason!
(Turning back to Jerry, he takes the check back. He just now notices the shirt Jerry's wearing, and snickers, pointing) Nice shirt.. (Laughs, Jerry shrugs) What is this? Is this what you wore on the show?
I wont mope.
(pleased) Yeah, it is.
Who cares about eyebrows? Is she sweet? I like sweet. But not too sweet, you could throw up from that.
Well...I've got a lot to do!
(clears throat) Heather Hi, it's George Costanza.
Hey, me too.
(Motioning toward waitress) I think she likes me.
Yeah. Me too.
Because I uh, I told her the truth.
(animated) N..no, no. You can't leave me. (frantic) Marry me! I'll burn myself. I'll burn my parents!
No..hummm, What do you know about what you look like.
It'll be different this time.
Thanks again for last night!
I can't do this! I can't do it. I have tried. I'm here. It's impossible.
Algae, obviously plankton, hmhm. I don't know what else I could tell ya, ah, Oh I-I just got back from a trip to the Galapagos Islands, I was living with the turtles.
I wasn't going to say anything, but then I could see that he wasn't going to open his mouth. (Chuckles)
You got hookers turning tricks in my car. How's that for starters.
"Will you stop with the Jimmies"
Oh! my god. Oh! man...
A guy leaves a puddle of sweat, that's a signal?
I wonder if thats really true.
(Heavily sarcastic. He's angered at Jerry) Good one. Very funny. You're very funny, Jerry. That's what I always tell people. (Yelling out) Jerry Seinfeld's a funny guy!
Right above you?
And then you came here.
Why did it all turn out like this for me? I had so much promise. I was personable, I was bright. (Elaine turns showing disagreement) Oh, maybe not academically speaking, (Elaine nods correct) I was perceptive. I always know when someone's uncomfortable at a party.
You know Ava's gonna be there.
(worked up) Stickin' it to me, Jerry.
June, June, June.
You've got to start seeing someone else. Get out of this relationship.
Are you sure?
Hey, where's you AIDS ribbon?
So I tell Alec that I have to go to Paris for an undetermined amount of time. Then all I have to do is buy some post cards and have your parents mail them from Paris.
You know what I never understood? Why did they change the siren noise? When I was a kid it was always "waaaa, waaaa", you know now it "woo-woo-woo-woo-woo". Why did they do that, did they do some research? Did they find that woo-woo was more effective than waa?
What? Did I what?
She's got everything, right? (counts on his fingers) She's intelligent, she's smart, she's got a great sense of humour.
Oh, there's a soup stand, Kramer's been going there.
And I'd like a discount.
We had sex.
No! It, uh, it wouldn't fit you.
What about me?
Pauline? . . . Wait a minute. I got it. My brother once impregnated a woman named Pauline.
Yes, you know. Deal with it .We have to deal with the doubt, Susan The DOUBT!! Must be dealt with.
Hey, you know what else is playing here? ``Rochelle Rochelle''.
Oh, pretty good.
(to Carrie) You know, you're really being very selfish. It would be nice if you would think of someone other than yourself every now and then!
You're uh, physical therapist, right?
Yeah. You could base a character on me.
Wh-Well maybe you should ask Elaine.
Nothing.
I'll tell you something, if I'd own a company, my employees would love me. They'd have huge pictures of me up on the walls and in their home, like Lenin.
You know it's like you never see a really attractive woman getting a traffic ticket.
Yeah. Thanks for, thanks for coming by fellas. Eh, got a set of keys, buried in the pothole.
Ade, ahh, ahh, ah ... Im giving you a raise!
(muttering)
I told them I have a place in the Hamptons. What did you say?
How do women know about shrinkage?
(surprise) Huh. I never heard you say you admire me for anything.
Joe DiMaggio.
Guess who he put in charge of Fitted Hat Day? Me.
MOOPS
(To his girlfriend) Nina, you have to decide right now. Jerry or me?
Well, I got just the thing to cheer you up. A computer! Huh? We can check porn, and stock quotes.
She says we cant go out anymore.
Right.
Maybe I could be a land guy.
Wha-Is that the one your parents gave you?
I cant do it. Ill, Ill keep her busy.
It's GEORGE.
Oh, there's better, (pointing at the row in front of them) right there, that's better.
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm terribly sorry.. (Bends down, and starts picking up her things)
What? Huh, so I had it all along. How d'you like that? (snorts) I guess I owe that cashier an apology.
I'm very attracted to you..
Chamomile's good. Lemon Lift. Almond Pleasure.
You know, if it was a regular salad I wouldn't have said anything. But you had to have the BIG SALAD.
Ah you have no idea of the magnitude of this thing. If she is allowed to infiltrate this world, then George Costanza as you know him, Ceases to Exist! You see, right now, I have Relationship George, but there is also Independent George. That's the George you know, the George you grew up with -- Movie George, Coffee shop George, Liar George, Bawdy George.
Yeah, I want to see if there's anything I can do.. maybe get him another job.. maybe I'll hear of something.
Oh, this is huge!
The whole time that I was growing up, all I ever heard from my mother was 'Why can't you be more like that Lloyd Braun?'
You know, we could go uptown, and that way we could give Jerry a ride home.
Where were you?
Ah. You know, there's gotta be an easier way to open ketchups. They should make it in a tube.
Kramer?!
Well, I'm the boyfriend. Otherwise, what's the point of being the boyfriend? This is where you have to be when you're the boyfriend.
You know a matron?
I was wrong, you were right.
So are they coming tonight or not?
Ah, come on!
Look, I'm doing you a favor. They're having an unadvertised sale. This suit is gonna be half-priced starting ... Monday.
Hey, hey, hey! It's not Lupe's fault, you shouldn't have left it out.
What's that?
Pepe.
All right, but we're not buyin' it at Bloomingdale's. I will buy it, you pay me back later. I'll sniff out a deal. I have a sixth sense.
Let me ask you something. Could you tell if teeth marks on someone's arm matched teeth marks on a pencil?
So what's in it for the mentor?
The doc called and said the lab's backed up and now I'm not gonna get the results for another two days.
GUILTY!
Really?
"Double-dipped"? What are you talking about?
(to Elaine) What are you doin' here?
Oh. How's the guy?
(takes a large bite - with his mouth still full, his speech is muffled) Oh, this is fabulous.
Yeah, she's quite a character.
(Muttering) Susan has the doll collection.. one of the dolls looks exactly like my mother.. she likes to sleep with it.
So go ahead pigeons. hu hu hu. Laugh it up. I'm getting in my car now and the last I heard ... we have NO DEAL!
Yes, but I am not taking it.
So, we watching the movie, or are we still talking? (Joe's wife shakes her head and goes into the other room. George gestures to Remy to move.) Okay, c'mon. Let's go.
What if it felt good?
See now this I don't get.
What?
What did you put the Pez dispenser on her leg for in the first place?
Like what?
So it was my comment that broke them up?
Yes!
You did that?
Wait, have you ever seen him throw up?!
Why is that?
He called in sick.
(to Jerry) You're very special.
Your hair?
Maybe it's not even stupidity. Maybe it's just a blatant disregard for basic human decency. Yeah this how dictator's start. Do you think Mussolini would circle the block six times looking for a spot?
Anywhere in the city - I'll tell you the best public toilet.
Oh, no. No stories.
That's gotta hurt!
One-one-thousand, two-one-thousand, three-one-thousand.
Yes, I've seen a silver dollar.
Hey.
What?
Yeah. And since you go buy there everyday. I was hoping that we could help each other out.
Well, Jerry's car gets hit and the other driver doesn't have any insurance, so the judge
Yeah. So what's going on? We're gonna shoot the pilot and then it's gonna be on TV the following week?
I know you did.
So, how was the trip?
[pause] Tonight?
Things are good.
All right. Shh! I gotta focus. I'm shifting into soup mode.
Hu-Yeah, interest. It's an amazing thing. You make money without doing anything...
You only think that because you know me.
Thirty.
Jerry, would you do me a favor, close the window.
Gee, Kramer, I uh...I don't know what to say.
"There's a lot of money in this.. He's got a proven sales method"
Please. Give me another chance.
So how was it?
Thank you.
(to the other laundry patrons) Any questions?
Uh, I'm just selling some of Dad's things, (looking into Kramer's eyes) that's what he would have wanted.
You can't just walk into a building and say " I wanna be a talk show host."
Gone. (Moves over to a chair in the living room. Kramer takes the carton of food to the table, and begins eating) The tenant association made me give it to this guy because he was an Andrea Doria survivor..
I don't think so.
Uh.
(Standing up) Yes. This is wrong!
This is a real piece of junk. I don't even feel safe on this thing. I have a good mind to write a letter toMr. Kimbrough.
Pardon me, I went to see your friend Dwayne... there was no discount.
Yes. You know the uh flood, and the uh lepers, and the commandments and all that.
She probably gets that impression because you're cool. You're under control. Like me. Nothing wrong with that.
(Picking up the ketchup) What typical? Gimme typical. Gimme some typical.
Plans. Schemes. She ah, she keeps talking about getting back together with her old friends, you know - "the gang," as she likes to call them (chuckles), you know. Yeah, they're eh, they're hatching something, you can count on that.
Yes. With a little guidance, Steven Koren is going to be everything I claim to be, only for real. That's my dream, Jerry.
Why is nice bad? What kind a of sick society we are living in, when nice is bad?
Yeah, Susan tell him.
Kissing is sex.
(staring at the wreck) Whatever.
I will never understand the bathrooms in this country. Why is it that the doors on the stalls do not come all the way down to the floor?
It's June.Mark's Michelle is a dog.
Hey believe me, baldness will catch on. When the aliens come, who do you think they're gonna relate to? Who do you think is going to be the first ones getting a tour of the ship?
Why?
No. Believe me, he's not.
You're in the movie? Is he in the scene?
Get going? But we haven't really, you know....
Hey! Saturday night!
I still paid for it!
This is very exciting. The inner sanctum.
Yeah you made it, how about that.
You cant be serious. This is New York city. There must be eleven million decent hotel rooms! Whatta you need? A flag? (waving his handkerchief) This is the signal, Jerry, this is the signal!
He knows that!
Oh, nothing.
Hello, it's Natalie? Yeah, this is a business office but I'm not a business man per se. I'm here working for the people. Yes, I'm causing dissent. Stirring the pot. Getting people to question the whole rotten system.
Because she asked me to.
Not the feats of strength..
Hi.
They could kick me out of the health club if he tells them!
No good?
Ho ho. This bizarre ?harrod? experiment must end!
Excuse me, are you gonna be very long?
Ill be right here.
I'll fake an illness. (Acts it out) My back! My back! I can't believe, my back.
Jerry, I can't. It's like saying to Pavorotti, "Teach me to sing like you."
Please...
George.
I dunno, I'm in a limo. (dials) Hello ma? It's me. Guess where I am. In the back of a limo. No, nobody died. It's a long story, I can't tell you now. Because I can't. I said I can't. If I could, I would. Would you stop it? Alright, look, I'm getting off. No, I'm not telling you! How's this? I'm *never* telling you! I don't care! No! Fine! Never!!
(Stern) No, ma, I'm not gonna see a psychiatrist. N- I don't care if you do pay for it! No! Discussion over. Yeah, alright, I'll see you later. Yes, of course I'm gonna come by. Alright. (Hangs up, slamming it down on the coffee table. He sits down next to Jerry) My mother wants me to see a psychiatrist now. Why?! Because she caught me? (Scoffs, shaking his head) You know, if everyone who did that had to go see a psychiatrist.. (Laughing, he snorts)
(he makes a sign to Jodi to wait and turns to Jerry) Jerry... This woman hates me so much. I'm starting to like her.
You think you could hook me up with these guys?
Yeah...(scratching his head) full.
So, he made an appointment for me to see Dinkins' doctor. He's just trying to humiliate me.
No. Lunch we read, dinner we read.
I'm excited about the pouty.
What? Nothing.
Alright, I gotta go home and open up with the house for the carpet cleaners. You know they're doing my whole place for twenty-five dollars.
What, you think I'm doing material here?
They're reorganizing the staff, and I'm on thin ice with this guy as it is.
Well if you didn't think I was parking, why did you put it in head first?
Duty is *nothing*. It's like sales tax...
What is that?
She knows there is nothing to talk about.
But you took me back.
You already told me everything.
I'll shout.
So, I guess I was lucky that I never tried that myself.
What's so hard about that? How am I supposed to get it in there? I can't just walk in with it. I have to get the Rosses out of the apartment!
A man carries a wallet.
Oh, it was. But he claimed it was a 5th Avenue bar.
No not vast (he pronounces it as "vost")
This is our new Vice-president of Acquisitions, sir.
Yes. Well...
Yeah, I grabbed it on the way out, I don't want my mother reading it.
So do I, but I wouldn't hang it on a wall.
Oh, yes of course, come in.
Yearn? Do I yearn?
Don't worry, don't worry, no scenes.
Jerry, did you hear that?
(still looking at that picture) You know if I told my engagement story to that receptionist, but told her this, was my fiance..
Excuse me, darling, do I detect a Portuguese accent?
(standing) Yes, payroll. Yes I did. Very productive. Payroll... Paid off.
What, did you go swimmin'? It's 29 degrees out!
All right, All right, all, right!!( gives the headphones to Kramer) How you gonna find out who this is?
Kramer, please.
Well I'm sure you have secrets from me. I don't know anything about your cycles.
WOULD YOU PICK A STATION!!!!!
In the whole world right now, there's maybe three emergencies. Why would you think, on this entire planet, that you're one of those three?
How about the old Spider Man live action show?
That's true.
Yeah and you get this really cool T-shirt when you sign on..
You like that?
Aw! Funny he's a funny guy.
(oozing fake sincerity) Well, as much as I enjoy all the good-natured ribbing, nothing really makes me happier than spending money on the people I care about.
(Fed up with his parents) Actually, I think I'm pretty clear on it.
No, I'm not. I would like to be, but I'm not. What am I gonna do? The book club meets in a few days.
We'll take it!
Is that the guy who likes fat women?
Hello. I'm O'Brien.
Yes you did!
I'll make time, because Abby, I was once like you; wide-eyed, naive, I didn't know the first thing about a subject as fundamental as risk management.
I told her I would have to think about it.
(To himself) So you're havin' the sex, next day you don't have to call. That's pretty good. (Back to Jerry) Go ahead.
Look at me! I am man! I am you!
Hey, buddies.
Especially her. She does not like disappointment. Well, I have to do it. I can't make December. There's no way I can make December. Right? I mean, you can see that, right? I mean, look at me. Look. Look. Can I make December? I can't make December. Right? Look. Look.
I'm the one he wants! He's coming to settle the score.
Could I, uh, could I trade you for another dollar?
No! No! Turn it off! No feats of strength! (Gets up and starts running out of the coffee shop) I hate Festivus!
No, you're not a divorcee. Youre just separated. You're---you're a separatee.
Listen, you're lucking I'm not asking for a whole refund. (trying to speak quietly) You gave me ladies' frames!
I gotta find a way to work this out, I love that apartment. It's so cozy, I'm ensconced in velvet. You know, if it were socially acceptable--
Well, you know, I've been lyin' about my income for a few years. I figured I could afford a fake house in the Hamptons.
What's the difference?
When I hear her name mentioned.
What's with the dog?
You got that from Elaine.
Ade, I have to tell you, I, I have never met anybody so ... efficient.
George! She said George? She remembered my name. (loudly -- to a passing waitress and the rest of the restaurant) Diane DeConn remembered my name. She was the "it" girl!
This is a *great* idea! Here... use this one. I get frequent flyer miles with every purchase... Wait! Get two tickets. As long as your turning it in for a refund what's the difference? I'll get *double* the bonus miles.
Tarragon? Oh, you're crazy.
All right, I gotta make a call. Everybody out, come on.
No... (takes off his glasses and wipes his eyes with his sleeve)
Don't you see. Women like that are like, members of a secret tribe living in a forbidden city. People like me have not been inside in thousands of years.. But with this, it's like I've already been with one of her own! My hands been stamped! I come and go as I please!
And then, then, then she leaves with somebody else! Never even, never even said goodbye! Never called me back.. Never apologized. Nothing. Like I was dirt.
Sorry, you don't know what's going on out there! (looks at Owen) Who's he?
Who?
I know. This was like a record. My previous record was when Joni Hirsch asked me not to tell anybody that we slept together. Kept a lid on that for about 28 seconds.
My Job..arghhh
(laughs-hu) So when're you gonna see her?
Again with the Rava.
What?
Why not? What do I care?
If I see things as they are, I would ask 'why' or 'why not?'
Hey, a shoe buffing machine!
It's disgusting--
But it's not a photograph, I need a photograph!
Not in the last fifteen minutes.
You sure?
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. It's from that grapefruit that Jerry squirted at me.
(to Jerry) "You know those shoes that Jimmy had? I cut a deal with him. We're gonna import a case of them together."
Oh! Great!
Ohooo what are we going to do? I'm shaking! I'm shaking!
Bar?
Hey. I've kept the same job for more than two years. It's not luck. Elaine, have you ever sent a racy photograph of yourself to anyone?
Hello?
(singing; imitating Tony Bennett) You know, Id go from nods to nothing...
Yes, yes, but uh, I have to make a call, so...
Oh, you do?
(attempting sincerity) As much as I'd like to see the two of you living it up in a warm, tropical, setting, I, I would just miss you too much. (smiling) So, I've decided, I want you to stay.
I tried to be nice. I wasn't nice?
I don't understand things were going so great. What happened? Something must have happened.
Yeah, it's being framed right now. I don't even know what it costs. (beat) Not, uh, too expensive, is it?
We're slowing down. Are those the people?
I'm "Pappy".
I'm sorry I missed it.
Why was he wearing a cape?
You just checked your watch. Are you thinking of bailing on him?
Okay, what about a nice frame? With a picture of another guy in it. Frame says I care for you, but if you wanna get serious, perhaps you'd be interested in someone like this.
Yeah, just tell him to hurry it up.
There was a box of raisins on the coffee table. Did you, by any chance, take them with you when left?
Beautiful lineswoman. Alright listen uh I'm going to go to the concession stand and get some real sunblock. You want anything? Jerry? (Jerry is staring at the lineswoman) Jerry?
All right. Kramer, you block off traffic. You to go sweet-talk the pharmacist.
Was there any nostril penetration?
Bye Mrs Seinfeld, take care.
Oh you mean face down on her chest.
Sorry. I'll just go back to my usual routine.
(to salesman) Well, maybe you could show me something else.
Was this something you had planned for a while?
You almost did the nose.
(sad) It's only four..
Alright, well why don't we smooth the head down to nothing, stick a pumpkin under its arm and change the nameplate to Ichabod Crane?
(Opens the door, looks in and then knocks 5 times) Mr. Steinbrenner, (waves) can I talk to you for a second?
The door? Why would I go out the door? The window's right here.
Yeah, I think, you know, she was, like, crying, and he was consoling her, and then, she, uh, just got into his car, and they just drove away.
This is very exciting! You're on the Tonight Show, NBC, who else is on the show?
Make-up sex? You have to have that right after the fight, we're way past that.
No, that's Jerry.
[Realizing full well it isn't] ...Yes it is.
What?
(Starting to panic again) What? Oh my God. What? Is it meningitis? Scoliosis? Lupis?! Is it Lupis?!
Yeah!
You know what I think? I bet she stole a tractor.
Hmm. What about a hole? You ever put anybody in "the box"?
Hu, oh. No he thought I was hiding something from him about Morgan.
Miss Rhode Island? When are you seeing her?
What happened? Where have you been?
Well that's the gist of it!
I have a fear of intimacy
Thanks again.
A different name for the butler? (Russell throws up again.)
It took a couple of hours of convincing. I was persistent. I was just like those guys in the movies. And it worked! She said "Yes"! I can't believe my luck that she was still available . A beautiful woman like that. You think she's good looking, right?
(hesitatingly) ... no...
Where are we going? Why are we pulling off here?
Unsettling?
Hello.
Why should she like me? Who am I? Huh, there's a million people to like.
All right, All right, keep your towel on.
(on the answering machine) Jerry, what's happening? Come on, pick up the phone.
(to the guy next to him) This guy stinks. (speaking of Michael)
Maybe I'll just meet you there.
I don't believe it, what did you say?
Yes of course go ahead. My guess is you're going to like this very much.
Aah, hey. (enthusiastic) If this works out, forget about it. Vacations together, movies together, dinner together. It..it's almost as good as if I didn't get married.
Well, Jerry. There was a pretty good chance I was never gonna have sex again anyway.
Well, it was a hell of a ride.
Hey Alec
He's beboppin' and scattin', and I'm losin' it!
Yeah, yeah. She's seeing this guy, Art Vandelay.
Today. Im going today. Just dont do anything until you hear from me.
What's the massage situation?
Yeah, eighty-three. Used to belong to John Voight.
Right. He cooks my food, he cleans my house, he does all my shopping for me. And there you go, that's your program.
Well, she didn't BUY the big salad. I bought the big salad.
Well, what about the open-lipped kiss?
I didn't.
(urgent) Move a pinkie, if it's yes. Can you move a pinkie?
Alright, so, go ahead.
Anyway there was all this tension. I asked her if she wanted to go out to dinner and she said "no, maybe we could get together for lunch." You know what that means.
I'm sure I will.
Alright, you having a good time there?
How can I take it?
Oh yeah?
And this is the first you're seeing of the coat?
Well what did you want her to do, you left it on the night table.
Nothing, why? You think something's wrong? Am I different?
Why not? Pay is good. I got dental, private access to one of the great handicapped toilets in the city.
Exactly. (Sees an off-camera co-worker) Erica!
(pleased) You've made Jerry very happy.
Well, Im going with him. Id like to... Ive never done a solid before.
[realizing the only way out is to show the stub] I've got the stub.
Kramer, there's a guy out here that...
Hey Elaine. (George hangs up his raincoat next to the door) Im telling you Jerry, having a secretary is incredible. (George claps hands) I don't know why I didnt have one before.
The prop comic? (Ronnie holds up his water gun and smiles.) Oh, hi...I didn't recognize you, what...did you get a haircut?
(Sitting on the sofa) I'm on no sleep, bro.
Celia broke out of prison. I'm sitting in my home, she shows up at the door!
Exactly.
If there's any doubt, I do a leave-behind. Keys, gloves, scarf -- I go back to her place to pick it up...(pop sound) date number two.
Uh, yeah. Do you know Babs?
Aunt Baby.
She was a delicate flower.
You'll pay? I'm there.
(he just took a bite of the Chinese food ) This is terrible. What is this, ginger? I hate ginger. I can't understand how anyone can eat ginger. (puts the container back in the refrigerator.)
You want me to roll six thousand of these?! What, should I quit my job?!
Fortunately, yes.
yeah, I ... I snuck a peak. ... But it was so fast I didn't see anything. It was just a blur.
Yes, yes, you know I was in detention and she came up behind me while I was erasing the blackboard . . .
Oh Jerry, that is so sweet of you but actually i already ate.
(hearing Jerry broke up with Patty) Are you still down in the dumps? Come on. It's just a chick.
Ah, here it is.
No, he isn't.
So how long has it been in the basement?
Who told you to sell the card?
George is going to the movies! (exits)
Okay, how about this? All right, we get married March 21st, the first day of Spring.
It's a very complicated move! I couldn't remember it all.
Why shouldn't I?
The table is interference, you know it!
Yeah, well you have to maintain the same disposition too. You can't start acting any differently. You have to be nice.
Look at where we are! (referring to the seat usher) He's not stopping! He just keeps going and going and going! (the usher abruptly stops at the second row) We're not in the first row?
There's a bag of Pepperidge Farm cookies up there.
Yes, well, if you had never taken your keys back from Kramer, he never would have taken his back from you and given 'em to me, in which case I wouldn't have had to take mine back from her.
Little Rock, Arkensas.
Tonight's the night, right? Prognosis Negative?
You see, hu, ho ho.
Jerry, a throat-clear is a non-verbal implication of doubt - he thinks I killed Susan!
Do you have your bathing suits?
Yeah. Really.
Oh, the bookstore girl. How's that goin'?
Jerry, where did you get that sweater?
Well, it happened again.
(Sees Gwen's meal) Hey, soup.
What's the matter with your leg?
Oh, this is fabulous. My God Elaine, you have to taste this.
I have no choice, I'm quitting.
What do you mean you will? That's a bad idea. Jerry is a very private person.
Yes I suppose they are.
Right. And, and to cover my nervousness I started eating an apple, because I think if they hear you chewing on the other end of the phone, it makes you sound casual.
Really?
So, Dad...
(eager) So? What d'you think?
You've got 'shiksappeal'. Jewish men love the idea of meeting a woman that's not like their mother.
Where you going?
Maybe like this.
You know what? I can't do this. I can't read books anymore; books on tape have ruined me, Jerry. I need that nice voice. This book has *my* voice. I hate my voice.
She called. He yelled Cartwright. I missed her.
Puddys just gonna give you the car, huh? (Skeptically) Youll see. First they stick you with the undercoating, rust-proofing, dealer prep. Suddenly, youre on your back like a turtle.
I loved her!
This friend of Susan's is staying with us for two weeks...Now am I wrong or is that excessive?
Yes, I saw that.
(considers for a second) I dont care.
Come on. Come on.
I'm not really sure, I...
Oh, my god that's Saddam Hussein. The dictator.
No, not really.
(out the window) Keith, Keith, up here. Can you do me a favor? I need you to go to the unemployment office with me. I, I'm Jerry's friend  the guy from the locker room,  I'm the chucker. It'll take five minutes. Wait. Wait.
uh oh..
I never tasted a cough medicine I didn't love.
Jersey.
You know, I can't remember the last time I called a woman without being nervous. I, usually, I'm pacing all over the room, I'm...
(entering Jerry's bathroom) Well, Hanke's moved on to Step Ten. He was spotted taking personal inventory.
Let me be the architect! I can do it!
Could you make it two-twenty-five that was his hi-game in bowling.
People always leave old things in their medicine cabinet.
What are ya doing?! Whadya, crazy?!
He can't not be funny.
(pointedly) Oh, I'm sorry, I require twenty-four hours notice for a cancellation. Now, as I see it, you owe me seventy-five dollars.
Is there a pinkish hue?
Well, this I take to the grave.
Hey, I'm his nephew, all right? Don't worry about it. Go ahead. Check it out.
Good, good day. How was your day?
(confused, to himself) Like me? But how?
You know my last name is Costanza. That's Italian. So you and I are like country men. Pisano's!
What kind of noodle do you want?
(Somewhat angered) She's in traction.
Whats the rent?
I think they really went for that Soda.
*No*...
Yeah.
I'm gonna read a book. From beginning to end. In that order.
Oh, I find you so charming. You wuss.
Oh!
All my life I've dreamed of sitting front row, behind the dugout!
"Jimmy, right."
(yelling) Awright, let's just stay calm here! Don't get all crazy on me!
(shouting) Fire!!
I can't believe this is happening.
He didn't say he can't.
Good, good day. How was your day?
I can't hear you.
Because if I watch it at my apartment I feel like I'm not doing anything. If I watch it here, I'm out of the house; I'm doing something.
I'm not going if he's going.
You didn't like it?
Kramer.
All right go ahead Susan, tell him.
Alright, that's it. Alright, good, eight thousand dollars. (to Cynthia) Cynthia, again, nice meeting you. Have I commented on the shoes? I love suede, it's so thick and rich. Did you ever, you ever rub it against the grain? Alright, anyway...
And I always take care of my Pisano's. So here is a little something. (drop in tip and worker looks the other way, so George decides to take it out and try again only to get caught)
Tell the cop.
I could have had some ice cream. I think that might have calmed down the nachos.
Well, I think we need more special days at the stadium, you know? Like, uh...Joe Pepitone Day. Or, uh...Jon Voight Day.
Isn't that where they remove the--
Ma!
Where the hell is your father?!
Kramer put Jerry on the phone.
Wa?
She's not gonna like it.
Remember that New Year's party he threw a few years ago? He had that very drafty apartment, you know, I think on Ninth Avenue.
(to Kramer) You got a job?
Oh no, in and out, I made sure of that. And you'll be happy to know I perused the script and it's met with my approval.
Talk to him!
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
She's a virgin?
No, occasionally I'll forget to let the machine pick up. Anyway, they made this large donation, to a women's prison, and I get to go down there and check it out.
You hear the way he talks to me?
Well you missed a lovely little party that we had for Grace.
They're not here! You cost me fifty bucks!
I'm a college graduate. You want me to be a mailman?
Yeah.
As a suspect in a serial killing.
She doesn't like. Here is your blue one, it's her favorite. (Takes sweater out of his bag.)
[quite out loud, not even pretending to whisper] Elaine!
A fan? I would drape myself in velvet if it were socially acceptable. And look at this, hardwood floors!
Nothing.
You telling me that wine is better than Pepsi? Huh (snort), no way wine is better than Pepsi.
You see, It's right here. It's all white...
Ah! Peggy. Good to see you.
Tell you how you could check.
Again with the checked out. I'm not going to the doctor. If I don't to the doctor, then nothing will happen to me. If I go he might find something.
If anybody should be getting more it's you.
You never played Vegas.
Kramer, I really owe you one.
Who's your favorite chess player?
Oh, uh...it's George.
Forget Gammy.
Oh, deserve! I don't know if I deserve...I mean...
You said the guy gave you an open-lipped kiss!
Ah, this is the kind of day that almost makes you feel good to be alive.
I mean we can put a man on the moon but we're still basically very stupid. The guy who's car this is? He could be one of the guys that built the rocket. You see what I'm saying?
God, you're like a rock star.
See? This looks right to you, doesn't it?
You have to stand tough sir. That's why I had to hang up the phone.
You know, you're going along, you think everything's all right and all of a sudden you get that tap. (George taps his own shoulder). You know it's like pfffff (whistling sound), all right that's enough, you're through.
No, that's my only suit. It cost me 350 dollars. I got it at Moe Ginsburg.
You know what you oughta do. You should go to her office and heckle her.
What kind of a therapist are you? I'm telling I'm scared that something terrible is gonna happen to me, right away you start looking for tumors?
(mutters it again)
You got it.
It's all worked out. Nina and I will have dinner Thursday at the restaurant where Babs works.
I told them to meet me in front of my building at six-fifteen.
Yes, I will do the opposite. I used to sit here and do nothing, and regret it for the rest of the day, so now I will do the opposite, and I will do something!
Yes, and I'm speaking at a men's' conference.
Yeah so did I.
Yes I look forward to many years of... looking at the triangles. Well, I'll ah, I'll wait for you outside.
Remember when you came to audition for us?
(Daring) You think you could?
Why not? It's a good look for a woman.
Are you sure?
Jerry, can we get out of here?!
George
So she doesn't want to see me anymore.
Pasta primavera! Back on the horse.
Should I leave this..?
You can't, it's a textbook.
Never said goodbye. Never apologized. Nothing.
Well say were frightened and we have to go home.
Out of the question. Out of the question!
Now if I wanna see anything I gotta wear these.
Where's Kramer?
Oh, yeah, right. I wish I had something on my mind. (pregnant pause) So how about that Kramer, huh?
What are you doing? You're robbing me?
Oh, the busboy left the menu a little close to the candle.
I can tell you this. If I am not in front of my house at six-fifteen, when my parents get there, they will put me on an aggravation installment plan that will compound with interest for decades.
Make myself comfortable. What does that mean? Does she want me to take my clothes off? Is she taking her clothes off? What if I take my clothes off and she still has hers' on? Then I really look like an idiot. She could get offended and leave. So maybe I should leave them on, but what then if she takes her off? Then she'll feel humiliated. 'Make yourself comfortable'. I got this unbelievable woman and this 'comfortable'-thing can ruin me. I got it! I take my shoes off and sit on the bed. There, that's comfortable. She can't accuse me being unconvertible.
Probably because this whole Universe is against me!
I feel like I'm in bed with my mother.
Don't need it. N'huhuhu (laughs)
..That.
Korea.
Yeah.
Pawn shop?
Yeah, (Smiling) Susan said you'd be excited.
Well you didn't have to say it like that.
Double jump! Eat the fly! Eat it!
Ho ho ho ho! I can't wait for Hanke to come crawling back to me.
I suppose he's an attractive man, I ,
What do they say?
Officer, he can't pull in head first.
(Desperate to get rid of the book) Alright, I, I'll just take fifty. Do - do we have a deal?
Take the suit.
No, I can't. What if I meet a woman? I'd always be worried about that first moment where I'd take it off and see that look of disappointment on her face.
I didn't get the job?
Ow. My eye, my eye.
Good. Of course...
Yeah. What's that?
(enthusiastic) And, you know, I do a lotta business with Japanese TV. They broadcast a lot of American baseball. They got an office here in New York!
I might go there.
It's more than the meal!
Wait a minute. This looks familiar. This reminds me of something. I can do this.
You schedule a late meeting.
Nah, I have asthma. (Robin's kid grabs George's leg from under the table, and George struggles.)
Where the hell is this car, Kramer?
Ill tell you when it happened. When that floss came flying out of my pocket.
Married , What!(astounded)
I'm the bad boy. I've never been the bad boy.
(points) And him!
I'll be O'Brien.
Something happened to the food?
(To Jane) You know, when I was a kid, I once found a dollar and fifty cents in change on the bottom of the pool.
Oh, there's a difference. It's subtle.
Mr. Morgan! Did you hear that? Mr. Morgan!
(Snaps, then points to the coffee table) Hand me an Emory board.
Dinner? (grabs Kramer)
Ah, I guess I should go up and apologize.
All right. So, what theatre you wanna go to tonight? We got 61st and 3rd or 84th and Broadway.
I want you to find out is she likes me.
You have my spare-key in your apartment, right?
He's actually doing him a favor. It's less money for him to buy food.
Pretentious? Who, who isn't pretentious? Ha, ha, if everyone who was pretentious was in a mental institution, ... uh, obviously THIS isn't a mental institution.
It's a calzone, sir.
He didn't say anything.
Yeah. Hey! Hey!
I think it's "on the wagon".
ahhhhh (exhaling) Jerry, my young friend, you're so nave. You are so, so nave. You know about a few things. You know about comedy, a little bit about relationships, some baseball, but you are so far out of your element here, you are embarrassing yourself. Now listen to me. I'm negotiating. Negotiation, this is what'cha do in business.
Oh Shut up! What are you doing back so soon, anyway? (puts the tape back in it's case.)
Because, Jerry, it's a couple rule! We have to tell each other everything!
Oh, he stole it!
Blanket
(Still holding the note) I think I'm having a heart attack.
I knew it.
Uh, I just went out, I went to look for my friend?
Nope, no can do.
It's not that I want to keep talking about it? just think that the subject should resolve itself based on its own momentum.
When you sent me the-the bill for the dry-cleaning. I thought the show didn't have a chance.
Now she thinks we're gay, not that there's anything wrong with it...
Well what's in this giant box out in the hall?
That's a tough minute. It's like waiting in the shower for the conditioner to work.
(Elaine walking down the hall they notice her and wave her into the room) Elaine! Get! (She enters)
Singapore?! Do you hear this?
Now, see here, doctor.
Oh, no, no, no...you sit right here...I will get you a nice snack.
Jerry, look at my eyes.
Just take the cap off!
Yea.
Uh, railroads, uh...
(adamant) Yes I am. I defy you to come up with a better name than Seven.
Yeah! She made me promise not to tell you .It's supposed to be a joke.
You want to be with somebody that doesn't like you.
Pamela?! Awright, I tell you what. You look like nice people, I'm gonna help you out. You want a beautiful name? Soda.
Dad. We need to talk.
Eh, they're trying to pick out a new couch - you don't want to know. (Remembering the watching Van Buren Boys) Give me your wallet, or I'll spill your guts right here on the street!
Yes.
I thought were a team.
(Scoffs) Writer. We're talking about a sit-com.
Me? No, no, I don't, I don't. Doing very well, very well, yep.
(Uncapping his pen) Alright, here we go.
Excuse me, I'm expecting a call. Costanza?
Will that be cash, or cheque?
Every woman on the face of the earth has complete control of my life. And yet, I want them all.. is that irony?
What, you think I eat all my meals with you? (To waitress) Excuse me, sweetheart? I think you may have overcharged us. What is this?
No, you didnt!
I really don't think we're supposed to be talkin' about this.
Excuse me sir. Would you mind watching my bag for a minute?
It's stuck on a piece of cloth here. I can't get the cloth out.
Ah, Just double park.
I'm sure I have a low IQ. I've been lying about my SAT scores for 15 years.
You stole the bread?
Hate the Drake.
This is dating , you can't leave anything to chance.
Oh, I'll pay. Half-price. Arrivederci my fellow 40-short.
Come on, how hard is that? Look at all the junk that's on TV. You want an idea? Here's an idea. You coach gymnastics team in high school. And you're married. And your son's not interested in gymnastics and you're pushing him into gymnastics.
(afraid not) No no, no no no. You're not goin' in there.
Flowing?
I got it.
No I didn't mean to imply that you did. You're obviously a very well proportioned individual. I was just wondering, have they ever offered you a chair?
You are ruinin' everything.
Vandelay? The judge's name is Vandelay?
Yeah.
I think Play Now is putting something in my food.
(over the speaker) It's George.
There's a show. That's a show.
(Rejecting) Ohh, no. No, no, no..
I'd like to be able to get it out.
I-I guess it can't hurt him... People eat *pounds* of those things.
What do you mean Wednesday? I though we had tickets to the Knick game Wednesday. We got seats behind the bench! What happened? Were not going?
Oh, you're dead.
Wha?
I-I just don't react well to these situations. My grandmother died two months early because of the way I reacted in the hospital. She was getting' better. And then I went to pay her a visit. She saw my face. BOOM. That was the end of it.
All right, let's postpone it. Let's get out of here.
Well, Play Now has all kinds of different rubber balls. Why dont we test your bladder system at my office?
Yeah. The thing is, I, uh...I had this little zinger of my own I wanted to try.
Well, does he wear bland, drab, olive colored clothing?
Not me. Everything should be negotiable. (he picks up a container of fruit)
Her scalp was clean. She had a nice skull. There just wasn't a lot of hair on it.
Perhaps.
I'll tell ya, if I ever get out of here, I'm gonna change my life. I'm gonna do a whole Zen thing. Take up yoga, meditate.. I'll eat right. Calm down, lose my anger.. (Sees Jerry and Elaine aren't listening. He snaps) Hey, is anybody listening?!
(outside, looking the guy trying the suit through the window, and thinking out loud) What's this? Can't I leave this place for a second? (goes in, take off his jacket, walks to the guy and talks to him with an european accent) Can I help you?
He's an importer-exporter.
Ah Ha.
Hey! Kramer.
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I used to come here all the time with my fiance, back when it was a meat-packing plant. Ha. Here's her picture. (hands her a magazine page)
Like this.
Jerry, the Mets lost.
My in-laws. Oh, my....
Why don't you find a doctor that doesn't know your difficult.
I guess she did. He's gone, now I'm the man.
I got lost on the way over.
Really?
Well, she's smart. You take my word for it.
What d'you mean?
How much you pay this maid?
Jody's nice.
She didn't mention anything about the conversation?
There you go.
What?
No, no....(mumbles)
(Reluctantly) Well, okay.
(sitting down) Where's Hanke?
You won't regret this, sir.
You know, I could let it go for.. say.. a hundred and twenty-five.
It's in Detroit though, it's an expensive flight.
No.
From me.
No, no. I just got here. A few minutes ago.
Yeah, well when you don't actually do the steps, you can go through them pretty quick. You can get through six a day.
Noo!
Your idea?
How ya doing?
How do you suppose they did that?
I probably didn't hear it on the way over because of the street noise. (he panics) This is no good! I got to meet these guys from MacKenzie for lunch in half an hour!
... Those spastic shnitzer twins ...
Oh uh hi Hi, David
Ask her about Kramer.
Why didn't you ask me? I know a million theater jokes. 'What's the deal with those guys down in the pit?'
That'd be me.
Uh, Mr Wilhelm.
I was quoting him. Why would I be insulted? I'm never insulted. You could call me baldy, dump soup on my head. Nothing insults me.
What trip? You were gone?
Excuse me. Are you using your catsup?
A free ticket?
Definitely.
Here, just give me a couple of napkins.
Me too.
Yeah, that was enough.
You know, you could've just given me Neil's number. You..you didn't have to take me out to dinner.
(Annoyed) If that helps you..
That's a great idea!!!
No.
No. Just imagine her reaction.
When did you get this idea?
If my parents had a mantel, I might be a completely different person.
It's something . It's hope.
14 months. Maybe 10.
Because we brought it for them!
(Threatening) Hold it! One more step and were walkin!
It varies.
You mean just walk into the staff meeting on Monday morning like it never happened?
You dont need a gardener.
You could do worse!
Oh I'm a chucker.
Wa..Wait.Wait!......Who is this woman?
you know, just by conversing, you can really learn a lot about a person.
Oh.
Fine. Excellent. Could you do me a favor? Could you not tuck the blankets in? 'Cause I can't sleep all tucked in.
Hey, did you see that whale thing on TV last night?
Well, we'll just see.
Why not?
Wait, wait a minute...they don't have them anymore. I just found out, they just took them off the market.
You'll have your turn! The truth must be heard. (Plays back the tape.) That's all there was. And yet, it speaks volumes. A low rumple. A metallic 'squink.' A 'glonk.' Someone crying out..."Dear God!" Let's start with, uh...with you, Wyck.
Boy, even I never heard that one...
Shhhhh. If you want to get in, theres very little time. (calling to the waitress) Sweetheart.. (Waitress approaches and tears off a check. George stops her.) No, no, no. That ought to cover it. (He hands her some money; she turns to leave; George stops her.) Just a second. Just a... let me jus-peek... (He looks at the check, then takes some money out of her hand. George urges Jerry and Elaine to eat.) Come on, come on, come on...
Is Ted Danson's deal standard?
Ponce de Leon? Okay. (to Jerry) You sure you don't wanna go?
When?
It's fine, it doesn't have to be about nothing.
Really? (Realizes) Well, you don't think it had anything to do with what I said, do you?
So, if I may jump ahead - you're gonna take dog medicine?
What's going on? He still wants to have dinner with us?
What's the matter with you? Are you crazy? Why are you using my name?!
Why can't we do this on the phone? What's Kramer doing now?
What?
One mile from the exit it starts shaking, really violently shaking, like it's having a nervous breakdown. It completely stopped dead.
Potussan. Ever try it with club soda?
Smarter than me? I don't want anyone smarter than me.
(Asking Elaine) Jerry seem a little weird when I mentioned Nina?
(Muttering) No, that's it.
I'm engaged to Mr. Ross' niece. I'm probably gonna be taking over this whole place someday so if I were you I would stay on my good side.
No problem. There's no problem. She just owes me ten dollars, that's all.
You know, we're living in a society! We're supposed to act in a civilized way.
Hey
I'm choking!
(Unconvincingly coy) About what?
Mister Seinfeld? What about Mister Costanza? I'm not here?
It's an inter-office envelope. It get passed around all over the office.
Yeah.
That's not how it happened. It's when he fell on him with his knee.
I had nothing to do wtih any of this! I met all her friends, I didnt want to meet them. I kept trying to avoid it. I knew it would only get me in deeper. But they were everywhere! They kept popping up all over the place. This is Nancy, this is Susan, this is Amy, this is my cousin, this is my brother, this is my father... Its like Im in quicksand.
He might as well have! I caught him, and his face was covered in chocolate and cookie crumbs.
Wait a second. I think I see where that laser guy is. No! Don't look! Don't look. Oh, yeah, that's him. Ok. I'm gonna sneak up on him. Now the hunted becomes the hunter.
What are you doing?!
I'll tell you what happened. I bet he got the AM/PM mixed-up.
What?!
Thank you.
Alright the administrator's on the third floor. I'll meet you guys back at the car.
Yeah.
Wait, as a matter of fact, wasn't there some guy in your building that you said you liked? He lived up on the fifth floor or something.
(calling after her) But..
Anna actually has respect for me now. (laughs/snorts) It's all over.
Why don't you just get some Ring Dings from the liquor store?
Dammit!
me? "step off"
No, impossible! Its your apartment.
Why not?
Loves bald? (laughs) Wow. Who uh, who is she?
Elaine, I once told a woman that I coined the phrase, "Pardon my French."
THIS is your daughter? My God! My God! I I hope you don't mind my saying. She is breathtaking.
Well, it was very nice meeting you Shelly and Jerry be careful, there's a lot of nuts out there. (to Paula) All right you have everything?
This is what I'm talking about.
Well we were all eating the raisins. And I remember you--you were eating some of the raisins. And then you left, and the raisins were gone. And I was just wondering if, you know (chuckles), maybe you took them with you.
She's bluffing...
(Persistent) Perhaps you could look again, please? Im very hungry.
You're kidding.
Hey Elainie. What's going on?
Jerry took the couch back.
Quick, what's your favorite animal?
Yes, a rosy glow.
I don't know, honey. What do you want to get? [in babying voice] I want you to get anything you want...'cause I love you so much. I want you to be happy. Okay, sweetie?
I don't know of this is the house. I don't see Jerry's car anywhere.
(Hands still out, even though they've stopped looking at them) What happened to him?
She did. Today.
I feel like a huge weights been lifted off my shoulders. I... I... I feel happy! Kramer, I dont know how to thank you!
So, he's keeping the apartment. He doesn't deserve it, though! Even if he did suffer, that was, like, 40 years ago! What has he been doing lately?! I've been suffering for the past 30 years up to and including yesterday!
Your own show?
I didn't take it, yet.
Yea
I'll take one. It's possible.
Why do you have to be so suspicious of every one. This is a great man Zeng Zau, he wants to help bald people.
Yeah, I never know what's going on there.
I doubt it. You know what he's doing now? He's putting a pool table in my old bedroom.
Yeah?
(almost gleeful) After Dinkins lost the election, he had a complete nervous breakdown. They had to lock him up.
Aw, well, you know, it's your anniversary. It's - it's the least I can do. I - I just want you guys to go out and have a good time. Ha ha. So, you think we should, uh, we should get downstairs?
No, no I don't think so.
My little man's an idiot.
Well, there's going to be a lot of dentists there.
Yeah, yeah, and we started talking, and she's this lawyer who's incredible! Everything I said was funny! You know, she laughed at everything I said, she thinks I'm hilarious. You know in a way, it was almost too good. I started so good, I can't go any place but down now, ya know? I got no place to go.
(PROUDLY) Me too.
It's probably chocolate.
Alright, very good, very good...go fold your little balloon animals, Eric. Eric! (chuckles) What kind of name is that for a clown, huh?
I watched "Beaches" on cable last night. (wings?)  Give me a break.
Two theaters?
And they say appearance is not important.
Ohh, yeahh.
You sure?
No, no, he mimed it. That's what was so funny about it.
No. He was fine with it. Check that out.
Well, last night she told me that she liked you. Not you, the disturbed you, so I had to tell her the truth.
Did you say, "The rines are crossed?"
There has got to be some way to get back into Pisano's.
Oh good, good, come in. Come in, welcome. I'm George. And this is Jerry, over there, on the phone, that's Jerry. And you are, um?
Ah. She's great, isn't she?
If you're in some situation where some fast cash will save your life, I'll give you the code.
I know, but don't say anything to anyone. He told me not to tell you.
Right.. the sign. (Hesitates, then makes a series of stupid gestures)
Yeah.
So you didn't turn her in?
(Stuttering) I, I, I, .. here, let me - let me help you..
Huh?
(desperate) Please! I have so little!
(to Jerry) Why dont you just turn it inside out?
(animated) What're you kidding me? We were all getting along so well. Where is all this coming from?
. . .uh, . . . wait a second. Are you suggesting that I went out of my way to tell Elaine that even though you handed her the big salad, that it came from me?
The same outfit?
Alright, thanks a lot.
(Struggling) No, no, no, no. I can walk it off. It's a hundred and twenty degrees in here.. I'll sweat it out.
Yes. Thank you! Is that so hard?
Hello, oh, hello. You remember, ... Susan, from N B C.
You told him? What did you tell him?
Uh, nothing. I got to go.
Hey I get a free trip to Paris, I go in the Big Brother's Hall-of-Fame, I mail my own postcards.
Well, I - I could, Uh, I could give the money back. Here. (Holds it out)
Okay.
(clipping on shades) Ha.. She'll have to find me first. (leaving)
Does Neil like to eat a big breakfast?
Oh, I found him. He was sitting on the steps of the library. I sat down next to him. He smelled like the locker room after that game against Erasmus
(gritting teeth) Yeah, sure.
Maura. (starts acting dramatically, looking from Maura to Loretta and back again) Oh, my God! What are you doing here?!
You know, uh, she has no female friends! You know that, don't cha? Something strange about a woman whos friends are all men.
Yeah, people who work at NORAD, whore on twenty-four hour missile watch. Everything was going along so great. She was laughing, I was funny... I kept saying to myself, Keep it up, dont blow it, youre doing great.
(holding his cane) I gotta hobble. (walks out)
Hey, Van B. Boys.
Narks?
That's a good score.
Its amazing. We, we both have dates on the same night. I cant remember the last time that happened.
You never run out, do you? (Jerry smiles.) Where's Kramer? Everything's finished here.
(interrupting) You know we should really order, the service is so slow here, by the time you get anything...
Newman!!
Because you were being so nice.
(pleasant surprise) Really? (admonishing) You know Gary, I really have to say, I'm a little bit hurt that you didn't decide to confide in me.
Yeah. It's a beautiful name for a boy or a girl...
Because it's really a pretty good little story. Don't you think?
Whad you do that for?
They're shooting! They're shooting!
I quit my job.
Oh, no, not just me, the whole organization. Especially Mr. Morgan.
I went to the beach. (Jerry and Elaine exchange looks)
What'd he tell you?
When are they gonna learn that any news about China is an instant page-turner? (seeing Jerry with a small black device) What's that?
Ah, shut up, Jerry. My parents think they can ignore me. Heh heh. Well, they better think again.
All right. All right. (They both leave)
Hi.
Pay phone in L.A., look it's a miracle.
Nothing. It's a card from my dad.
Psst, You're telling me.
What's it say?
Thank you.
Now, because of that stupid rye bread, I gotta keep them all separated for the rest of my life.
So you're talking...
You know what I would like to do? I would really like to have sex with a tall woman. I mean really tall. Like a like a giant Like six five.
What a succinct story.
Oh, well, he was probably just getting anxious to start his vacation.
(worried) Yeah, that's right. What if it's a genetic thing, like father like son?
No. We're supposed to tell him tonight.
The guy that stole my glasses. This time I got 'em! (George follows the man onto the street, dragging the blind man with him) Would you pick it up a little?
Let me put that on speaker phone.
NO!!
Heard that one already.
Well, whoever he was, he knew a lot about The A-Team!
Thanks. Gee, you know, I thought you were mad at me.
Hand modeling? (Shakes his head 'No')
Hes a cube. Anyway, he got married six months ago. He told me ever since hes been wearing a wedding band, women have been coming on to him everywhere he goes.
Why didn't she tell us?
(enters) Hi.
Hey, hey, hey! Whats goin on here? (To Jerry) You didnt agree to anything, did ya?
They saw me walk out.
He did it right as he said "her unfortunate accident."
All right. Don't change me. Susan. Don't change me. Ya know there are a lot of woman that would love to be in your position right now.
Good.
Hey. Check these out. I just picked them up from Sheila. She must have loved these.
So concerned was he, that word of his poor tennis skills might leak out, he chose to offer you his wife as some sort of mediaeval sexual payola?
Alright, how's this? We wait till we get to your street corner, we see Elaine and Kramer then we get out. They can't shoot us in the city.
You haven't won. You may think you've won, but you haven't won. Do you know why? It's not over. This is not over. I'm not forgetting what's happening here. You have my ten dollars. I will get it back. Alright, don't worry. It's not over. I'm going now. Good bye. I will be back.
I was so shocked I was lucky I said anything.
(Even more nervous than before) Oh, the, uh, the cabin.. well, (Clears throat)
Oh, my God.. (Buries his face into his hands)
Thanks a lot. I'm really late. My parents are waiting in front of my building and we're stuck here.
(rising to his feet) Hey! Hey, you! (setting off after her) Come back here!! Don't gallop away!!
No, YOU do!
What?
Oh, that's wonderful.
Whew! Boy, it's cold outside, huh? Oh, these New York winters, huh. Bitter cold, bitter.
Can I ask you a question? Would you mind switching seats?
Yeah, yeah, like it's just part of the conversation. Oh my boyfriend really likes watches. He's a real watch freak. We-e-ell that's fabulous. (snaps fingers in the air a couple of times)
There was nothing else on. Oh, the left arm.. the left arm.
Yeah, the super glossy. The best they had.
Sic semper tyrannis? What is that, Latin?
(pleased) I know.
Babu Bhatt? How I'm going to explain this?
Well, you know... the friend meeting the new woman. I feel like I'm getting fixed up for a friendship.
Na....no ... This relationship he..he..has got to be about something and fast or I'm in very serious and weird trouble....hum What else happened?
So let's say in her mind she witnessed a pick. Okay, so then what?
Wait a minute Jerry, there's a bigger issue here. If you go through that wall and become one of those guys I'll be left here on this side. Take me with you.
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, go. Go about your business, I'll just wander around.
Its been a long night. You go home and get some sleep.
(to himself) That's what I'd like to know.
... She's got it stashed away in there somewhere.
Believe me, I am not crazy.
The guy playing Kramer threatened me.
Come on! Come on!
Can you do it?
I dont know, what? Eight thousand. Its a Hyundai. Get out of here. I told you not to sell. Simons made money, Wilkinson cleaned up.
I don't know. She..She's having some problems with this guy she's seeing.
Really?
(yells) I didn't tattle
Right out of the clear blue sky?
That's what I wanna know.
It gets here when it gets here. Would you stop ridin' me?
Are there terrorists on the plane? A hotel fire. Is that it? Malaria? Yellow fever? Lupus? Is it Lupus?
You know, suddenly I'm in the mood for pasta primavera myself. (Jerry nudges George to sneak a peek at Molly's cleavage as she bends over and looks in her backpack. Jerry has a quick look, but George stares, hypnotized. Russell comes up behind George.)
No. That's not that.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I don't think it's gonna work out...
It was a good jig.
Kramer...
Oh, these are my friends, Elaine and Jerry, ... Noel
Yes.
It's standard. Has she left you one of those messages where she uses up the whole machine?
(Reluctantly) Yeah.
Jerry, do you have any fishsticks?
No, that's the Netherlands.
Well, he's merry.
...stop pushing. (to Elaine) Kramer spilled ammonia.
Well there is traffic. It might take her till eight-fifteen.
You're going that way anyway!
Lemme see. I can't believe you got these for free. (Looking at the tickets) Row F?!
(big smile) Eight thousand dollars.
(from the intercom) Yeah, its George.
How much do you tip a chamber maid?
(Acting innocent) I'm all set.
Alright, that's enough.
Sir, I just got a call from the terrorist. I told him to call back here.
All names sound strange the first time you hear 'em. What, you telling me people loved the name Blanche the first time they heard it?
Guys with cats... I dont know.
( becoming more and more awkward) Yeah.....
Did she say why?
Maybe Manya missed the funeral because she was off visiting another galaxy that day.
What?
Cleaning them out.
Well I'm not starting up a whole new wardrobe now!!!
You would think that at the end of the week when they hand out the checks, throw in a few soaps.
(to Jody) You're listening to this?
Good. Now get out.
Shes a pig. The woman's a pig, what wrong with her--
Okay. How about this?
He's extremely Murphy. He's Murphy to a fault.
What about the mail?
Yes! Yes. You know. She didn't know about Pasteurization. He didn't know anout Fumigation. But they made it work!
Was it a scratch or a pick?
I'm against all "it's me"s. So self-absorbed and egotistical, it's like those hip musicians with their complicated shoes!
You've never heard of Bozo the Clown?
Aaaaaah
(bemused) Really?
Yeah, yeah, should've written it down.
And you automatically sleep with her?
No, I want to go.
I'm just happy to be working with your talented son...
You know, they say ostrich has less fat, but you eat more of it.
Can you believe it? It's happening! It's finally happening! I'm free!!
I know someone wholl do it. Shes good. Shes honest.
She treated me to the Arabian mocha java.
(Anyway,) on the left--exquisite marble! High ceilings. An' a flush, like a jet engine! (imitates sound) Ha ha!
Listen uh, David, I, I, I want to apologize about that comment
You got less than sixty seconds. That's like dismantling a time bomb. What got into you?
"Ah! your just mad 'cause we beat ya."
Faking? What makes you think that I have time to see doctors, take X-rays, make appointments, when there's absolutely nothing wrong with me? What kind of a person would do a thing like that?
No, no, what, what?
You would think that, but either youre born with a sense of humor, or youre not. Its not going to change even if you go from the red sun of Krypton all the way to the yellow sun of the Earth.
What is this thing doing here?
(singing) Oh hey, if you happen to see the most beautiful girl who walked out on me. Tell her I'm sorry. Tell her I need my baby ... oh won't you tell her ... I love her. Oh hey, ...
Gimme the purse!
Who?
I guess it's on my resume.
Hi, how are you?
They're men with jobs, Jerry! They wear suits and ties. They're married, they have secretaries.
Alright, we're back in!
Well, I don't see how I'm gonna make December. I mean, I need a little more time. I mean, look at me I'm a nervous wreck. My stomach aches. My neck is killing me. I can't turn. Look. Look.
I'm baby-sitting! Vivian asked me to raise him if she doesn't make it.
It's huge!
(to various people as he walks in) Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Hi nice to see you. How are you. Good morning. (to the secretary) Good morning.
Let's have it.
I like Christian rock. It's very positive. It's not like those real musicians who think they're so cool and hip.
I heard what you said "Sharon, are you there?".
Care to make it interesting?
That was very real.
Alright, the dentist thing was not good.
Apply for a job? What for?
Mr Wilhelm, what was that?!
Oh! I know....'Cos you don't think Janet?..
Split it. Pretty good. Talk about game six?
Well... we could dance around it a little first.
huh Kramer it's huh.. gonna be pretty dangerous up there
Keys. I can't find my keys.
(Puts his arms in the air, stretching, and covers his mouth with an arm) Could you ask her, just ask her. If she says no, case closed.
Apparently the Seinfelds' are too good for us. I shouldn't say anything bad about your uh your partner.
(Shocked) She's pregnant? Leslie is pregnant?! Oh, see, there is no justice.
All right, OK, I'm goin' in.
No, he doesn't know O'Brien, if he knew O'Brien he wouldn't have a sign. Let's just do it.
Oh, share.
Kramer. Anything good in there? Any Popsicles?
So?
Maybe the baby would like to see my spot. A positive, uplifting message to start his life out with. Huh, You can still get a great space in this city - if you apply yourself.
(agitated) He's lying, sir! I'm tired of all your macho head games!
Yes. The legends are true.
Um, excuse me, I think you forgot my bread.
(angry) Well, that's the name!
I think it's neat. You don't hear that much about god anymore.
Standard?
It's like going to the bathroom in front of a lot of people and not caring.
I won't feel like a writer.
You know, sometimes those guys don't make it back. (Looks in fridge) I'm really hungry.
To some degree.
Watch me.
Nice day today.
Why? That's a *legitimate* sociological question.
Cancer? Is it cancer? Do I have cancer?
But Mr. Steinbrenner, how can I be expected to perform my job properly, knowing that my uh, subordinate is making more money than I am? With all due respect sir, it's outta whack.
(Watching the mechanic leave) I know about the vein! I cant believe this guy..
Well , not yet.. Fianc.
No.
Hi Connie, Jerry around?
I don't want any mango.
He probably doesn't want to get chocolate on his fingers. That's the way these society types eat their candy bars.
(frantic by now) SHUT UP,SHUT UP, SHUT UP,...(then leaves)
I'm starving...
Im fine.
He said what?
How about Chinese?
Were up to two dollars here.
No, I don't know. Maybe you haven't. You know, not everybody's seen a massage table.
What, you didn't ask him about the car?
(adamant) It's not cheating if there's no sex!
I dunno they said maybe.
(smiling) Listen, I..I..I don't mean to seem forward...
Don't you see what this says? How can you possibly like somebody ,if you think they look like this?
You're considering hiring me for your latex salesman.
No, I dont care.
All bald people look good in hats.
(Pleading) You gotta let me go over there.
I, I think I made my point. I'm sorry if I was a little harsh.
(Whispering to Jerry) What time is our flight back? I got to go to the bathroom.
What, what happened to you?
Why do you keep saying Nina?
For how long?
It's an early Christmas present.
(surprised) Rosses.
Will I call you when I get home? ha ha What do you think? ee, you kill me kill me
(to Carrie) It's just that, I know her, and boy...
So you thought she was good looking and figured this would be a good way to meet her.
I dont understand.
Photo store Sheila.
Ten minutes! Here, here, (Fishes a box of Tic-Tacs out of his coat pocket and tosses them to her) Have some Tic-Tacs.
(Yelling out, frustrated. The camera spins from a top angle) Twwwwiiiiiixxxxx!
Nobody drives like me. Nobody. I'm doing things in this car, you have no idea they're going on. Wanna see me make a right turn from the left lane? Watch this.
YES! It Blows Up! If you knew that, what did you tell Elaine for?
Is he still nuts?
Well, I join them in their grief.
What were her exact--
Yes. Why, is that so inconceivable?
A-ha.
Jerry, I felt like a straight man in some horrible sketch. He was riffing! Riffing! On my pain!
Alleluia.
Likewise.
What did you go on a picnic?
She wants to talk to you.
And now?
(crying from the onion) You'll see I'm right.
If Elaine wanted to get some coffee.
Alright. I'll run it by a few people.
So, maybe this should be it.
The guy slept with Marilyn Monroe, he's in Dinky Donuts. What about this doctor's note? Let's go see your friend Roy.
Yes, I sure did.
Oh yes, Mr.Wilhelm, yeah...
?? get away??
No you weren't. Stop there, that's fine.
Hey I'll get married if I have to. Al Netchie will think twice before he opens his mouth about me again.
It was kinda fun. (Elaine gives Jerry a cold cloth for his jaw.) You know, maybe his name really is J-O-H-N, but he changed it to J-O-N for show business. Well, you know, J-O-N is a lot zippier.
Come on, Kramer.
(forcing a laugh) Hu, ha.
What the hell is a gander, anyway?
Shut up?
Why doesn't *he* pick you up after the operation. He's got the car with the bench seats that you like.
Yes.
Hi.
That's it?
Yeah, this is my first time here. (nudges Jerry again)
So what's your point?
I don't think I've ever spoken to her.
Yeah, fun. IQ tests are totally bogus. They prove nothing.
Anything, everything, something, nothing - Who the hell cares? Put me down. I'm down!
Yeah, he did.
All right, I?ll tell you what, you seem like a nice guy, let?s stop jerking around. Give me.. two hundred and fifty dollars, I?ve got people waiting for me, I've got to get the hell out of here.
(knocks) You hem... wanted to see me Mr. Steinbrenner?"
Yeah.
Mr. Steinbrenner--
Oh, you haven't heard, she's going to live with her grandparents in Redding Pennsylvania.
Well, lets just leave.
When do you ever have ten car lengths?
Beef-A-Reeno? You fed the horse Beef-A-Reeno?!
(looking over her resume) Well Miss Coggins you're ah, obviously qualified for the job. You've all the necessary skills and experience. But you're extremely attractive. you're gorgeous. Im looking at you, I can't even remember my name. So ah, Im afraid this is not going to work out (he crumples her resume into a ball) Thanks for coming in.
(anticipating the answer) Not.
Alright, but I'm serious about this.
Costanza. Costanza.
Ahh, money.
Wha..wait a minute, wha..what about Reilly?
I'll tell you what's insane the price that I could get you on a new desktop computer.
I was trying to loosen 'em up a little bit.
(Sulking) That's why I hate it.
So what?! She still gave you advice; what's the difference if she's not Chinese?!?!
(Jerry-style) That's a shame.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. As long as youre going to lie to the guy, why dont you tell him that you lost both of the tickets, then we can go?
Oh man.
Already you're marrying this guy?
So?
Nine. Thirt... thirteen's no good.
Then why don't you try and get him another job?
Is she the only girl in the whole world? Why can't you get find your own girl?
how did I know you were here? Something drew me here. This is phenomenal.
Yes.
My whole life is ruined because of the (Mocking, bitter tone) "puffy shirt".
What quit? (laughing) Who quit?
"Aahhrgh...it wouldn't take...... long pause, audience laughter) ten minutes from now, I'll be sweating all over again ,I can feel it. I'm a human heat pump!"
Exactly.
You're not really gonna go to California, are you?
Good morning Mr. Wilhelm.
(playing with toys) Ahhhh, Yes! Touch down! Your turn, Jerry. (hands Jerry the Mattel Football. George starts playing with the Etch-a-sketch.)
I still have brill cream.
Isn't that that Bania guy?
What's up?
All right, Puddy, listen, and listen good I need to know the name of that mechanic that walks around here. Big guy, a liar. Short name. Sam? Moe? Sol?!
I don't know, but those are my socks! I had a pair just like that with the blue stripe, and now I don't have them anymore!
What?
Jerry, it's me, George, don't worry, I'll return it tomorrow, no problem.
You wanted to see me, El Presidente?
(sitting down next to Jerry) Seeing Maura. Apparently, I was unable to break up beyond a reasonable doubt.
Did he just steal the raisins?
I don't have a job!
Eee-aaa-eee-aaa-eee-aaa...
Kramer goes to a fantasy camp. His whole life is a fantasy camp. People should plunk down two-thousand dollars to live like him for a week. Do nothing, fall ass-backwards into money, mooch food off your neighbors and have sex without dating; that's a fantasy camp.
Would they tune in?
You mean that's true, I'm right?!
I did!
Really? (feeling flattered)
What? Where are you going?
That was different!
No, I uh...
Uh, Tim, the pencil...
I'm in line to buy.
Ooh ho hoo, forget it.
(Not really wanting to embellish) ..I stopped by the house to drop the car off, and I went inside for a few minutes.. Nobody was there - they're supposed to be working. (Jerry and Elaine look at each other - enjoying the story) My mother had a Glamour magazine, I started leafing through it..
There might be some moisturizer.
No, never mind.
That condom killed me. Why do they have to make the wrappers on those things so hard to open?
I'd love to be a Civil War buff. ... What do you have to do to be a buff
You didn't tell her.
Well um, what about tomorrow night?
Hello Stu.
Your wake up guy asked you out?
(Muttering out, not really wanting to talk about his family) When the Costanzas came here, one brother stayed behind.
Oh that's OK, really, don't worry about it.
I think she finds my stupidity charming.
What?
Oh, no. No no no no.
She's not there. She left. She must've waited and left because those people wouldn't get off the phone.
All you got is instant coffee? Why don't you get some real coffee?
I confused it with another awning.
Hey.
Kramer, she's a model.
What accident?
Nah, the cable's out. What's with you? You look dead.
I lost them. I can usually come up with one good comment during a meeting but by the end it's buried under a pile of gaffs and bad puns.
"'Cause when he questioned me about it I was sweating from the Kom Pau.."
Hi Beth (Scene Ends then re-begins with Beth and George on Beth's couch) Um anyway Jerry told me that uh.. it might have been my comment in the Coffee Shop that broke you up.
Oh, uh, just a friend of mine.
Brown.
Five thousand... Ten. Ten thousand. Five thousand.
So?
Yeah. Just confirming.
It's a broad noodle.
If she want's to continue to have a fibre of her being she'll be very careful (hitting each other)
Payroll project. Wilhelm? Big uh, big payroll project.
That's right.
It is too!
(getting excited) That's, that's incredible. My Cousin Vinnie, I love her, she was fantastic!
I wanna get it back when we were the Gatsbys.
Hey! George and Janet.
Right.
Oh yeah, everybodys guy is the best.
'Just listen to the music of the traffic, in the city. Linger on the sidewalk, where the neon lights are pretty.' Where the neon lights are pretty. The Broadway area?
what?.. that's ridiculous!
I am not! What you call wasting, I call living! I'm living my life!
I don't know. I don't wanna be one of those guys.
(thinking she means the breasts) What!!
It's a joke.
Ah! See? I told ya.
Jerry, what are you doing...
Yeah so??
(Puts his hands on his face, rubbing his eyes) Look. It's a skill, just like juggling. She probably enjoys showing it off.
Me, why?
I-I-I can't find my glasses.
Yeah, conjugal visit sex. That is happening!
I didn't shave this morning. I don't feel like myself.
Well, live and learn.
Well, that pear shaped loser was me! And I was in that photo, until I broke in here, stole the photograph and airbrushed myself out of there!
That's good, we'll give it a try...
I had 'em, Jerry. They loved me.
(Jerry is going to his bedroom) What?
Why don't you call her agency. Maybe she's been out of town and she didn't get the calls.
Play Now thinks I got problems in both legs. My own personal Rascal, Jerry. On the house.
(Smiling) You got it, Ma. (She smiles back, nodding) A little later. (George sits back in a nearby chair, looking at the divider in anticipation)
Hello.
Kind of.
Yeah.. They made me sick.
What are you doing?
Yeah?
Too bad , it's all done.
(still on the phone) All right fine.... Whatever
Come here.
(wry) He knows.
Sounds like a rough trip.
Yeah, like I'm going to risk my job with the New York Yankees to make a few extra bucks. (winks)
(shrugs and lights it up)
Simple joke from a simple man.
Without thousands of fleeing Japanese.
Yeah, I wish.
What's the difference, you're a woman. They're supposed to be touching you.
Yeah, I do that too. I feel guilty about getting the pleasure. I feel like I don't deserve it so I talk. It stops me from enjoying it. There's nothing to eat in here.
You don't understand. A garage. I can't even pull in there. It's like going to a prostitute. Why should I pay, when if I apply myself, maybe I could get it for free? (he hears a horn honking) What? What do you want? Go around me, I'm looking for spaces.
You've got a bet.
Yeah. I may have stepped on her arm, too, I don't know.
Fantastic?
(angrily)"WHY WEREN'T YOU MORE CAREFUL WITH YOUR DROOL!"
Um, cream soda?
Oh, so you don't believe me either?
You don't have your own camera.
Something's going on here.
(thinking of the moans) Heh. (Karen takes another puff of her cigarette) You seem like you really enjoyed your Risotto. (chuckles) You have a very contented air over there. (chuckles again) You look very contented, very satisfied. (pauses) Are you satisfied?
Its over.
Jerry, could you excuse us for a few minutes, please?
I just can't believe at the way people are. What is it with humanity? What kind of a world do we live in?
Yeah, now I gotcha! (hangs up the phone and rushes out the door)
Just when I was doing great. I told you God wouldn't let me be successful.
Okay, all right, all right.
Channel eleven? Forgive me for trying to class up this place, for trying to have the Yankees reach another strata of society that might not watch channel eleven.
Maybe I'll buy it.
(bored to death) Well, I-I just recently uh...
Are you a religious man, sir?
So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified! But I pressed on -- and as I made my way passed the breakers a strange calm came over me. I-I don't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment  I was a Marine Biologist!
Elaine, when a woman makes a Ball Entrance.. she twirls.
You had to hop! You had to hop on the plane.
I gotta get to Fowler. I know that he would take this squirrel off my hands. It's practically bionic!
A guy?
Thanks.
Hey, Buck. Talk to you for a second?
Seemingly. Seemingly, to the untrained eye, I can fully understand how you got that impression. What looked like pushing...what looked like knocking down...was a safety precaution! In a fire, you stay close to the ground, am I right? And when I ran out that door, I was not leaving anyone behind! Oh, quite the contrary! I risked my life making sure that exit was clear. Any other questions?
So?
It's George
The contest - I cheated.
Nothing. Uh, I don't know. I gotta go.
(TALKING IN PASSENGER WINDOW) I didn't mean anything by it. I don't even know L. Ron Hubbard! I didn't know you were...
Ah, I've had everything on the menu. Uh, surprise me.
What?
Yeah.( reaches for the purse and finds a piece of paper . he looks annoyed.
Ha! Heh.
Maybe I can get her locked up.
Jerry, where y'going? It's... what're...
Two no-tucks.
Look, you wanna have sex right now? Do want to have sex with me right now? Let's go! C'mon, let's go baby! C'mon!
Hey, hey! Yankee game! (Changes the channel.)
Elaine, huh... Peterman account?
You weren't thinking.
Youre gonna overdry it.
The nickname. George. What is that? It's nothing. It's got no snap, no zip. I need a nickname that makes people light up.
But you are Blanche... You *are* in the shackles. Oh, I can't wait to read my *Time* magazine! Laaaast copy, too. Maybe I'll read it tomorrow-- in the park! It's supposed to be a beeyootiful day! Have a nice life... sentence, that is!
I'm sure you are.
I don't know, I was starving Jerry!
So...?
I think we have.
and JERRY Yeah.
Well, it was slightly used...
(Thinking to himself) She's not concerned about the security guard. What kind of a person is this? I'm marrying a person who doesn't care that this man has to stand here 8 hours a day when he could easily be sitting.
Do you really think so?
Well, you know, I was thinking about what you said before, and...you're right, I've never really been a couple, so...if that's the rule, then I'm gonna go by the rule.
Yeah, my cleaning lady's Portuguese. I must've picked it up.
Well, as I say, the pink-eye made my vision...quite blurry... (Joe's daughter comes to the door.)
(to Kramer) What about your stuff?
They could've at least tried!
If anyone should be forced to leave that place, it should be her!
So, whaddya say? You know you'll always be the only man I'll ever love.
Guess, what I got.
I don't think we should see each other any more.
'Cause Neil Watkins from accounting is T-bone!
I can't believe you're really going out with a woman named Lois.
Elaine, Julie.
Alright. I guess I just have to pick myself up, dust myself off, and throw myself right back down again!
horning on my rock climbing trip. It's just supposed to be me and Tony
They got a new intern from Francis Louis High. His name is Keith. He comes in Mondays after school.
You think?
Yes.
"How's it going?" - beautiful.
Well anyway, the, uh... the stone is up, I paid my respects, guess that's it.
Hey, people, people, people, people, people. Not bad, huh? Excuse me.
What? Every time I leave my house now I have to call everybody I know and ask them if they want to do what I'm doing?
(laughs) Not quite.
Did you ever read anything by him?
Hey, did I tell you I called one of those girls from the personal ads in The Daily Worker?
I was just curious.
(Mocking, skeptic) Yeah, you show us the 900.
(Still standing) So, you're gonna sit there?
(smiling) So, you know, what, what happened?
Take a guess.
You're selling computers?
Hey listen... umm, instead of the movie... uh, maybe we'll go back and uh you know...(nudges her head with his head)
(Talking it) Im here helpin you.
Listen to this. Marcy comes up and she tells me her ex-boyfriend was over late last night, and "yada yada yada, I'm really tired today." You don't think she yada yada'd sex.
Well I just got the estimate. It's going to cost more to fix that roof than the car's worth, So I'm going over to see that hospital administrator today. Someone is gonna pay for this damage and it's not gonna be me.
Well, Jerry doesn't want anyone to know.
Hate the big coarse "ha." Hate those.
(over the speaker) It's George.
I slipped on the invitations...how's the towels?
I know. I just sort of leaned on it so it would look like it was mine.
No! Jerry!
I did. I'm back. I love this relationship, I feel so liberated!
Why would I...
(standing up) I'm just gonna go to the bathroom.
(sitting) Newww tuxedo. For the Pinstripe Ball. Steinbrenner is throwing a huge party at Tavern on the Green, heh!
I guess you two are the lucky ones.
So you lied to her?
(tearing out cheque) Yeah, same time. (hands over cheque) There you go.
Oh, great.
All right. That's more like it. Thank you very much. (giving the sponsor the 'be strong' hand clench) By the way, my uncle was an alcoholic, so...
What does this mean?
Forget about smelling the car. Smell the valet. Go to the source...
So good for you.
What's Yo-yo Ma?
I said so many things.
Hello..
Sons of bitches!
This woman just set me up for a job!
Elaine...let me just explain something to you. See, this is not just a weekend routine...I'm on the verge of make-up sex here. You know about make-up sex?
No, no! You can't throw me out
She called my office. She said shes been in the Hamptons since Sunday. She didnt know if I was trying to get in touch with her. Her machine broke, and shes been using her old machine and she doesnt have the beeper for it.
Hey, hey, how was Florida?
Oh, the hamstrings fine.
(shouted after Elaine) You know, I got nothing outta this!
This is delicious, Mrs. Ross.
(very worried) Uhm, I, I gotta go.
What, you're gonna pass up a wonderful opportunity to put that aloe pusher in her place?
Yes.
I still won't be able to forgive myself - but at least it won't be about this.
This is a huge project involving lots of numbers and papers and folders.
For a woman.
Yeah. Cotton breathes, you see, it's much softer. Imagine playing games and your team is five degrees cooler than the other team. Don't you think that would be an advantage? They're cooler, they're more comfortable...they're happier - they're gonna play better.
Hey Fred.
Yeah. Yeah, he's quite a character.
(Stingy) Its wrinkled. Its worthless.
Same thing!
They were right outside!
I like it!
Nice meeting you.
Keith called you?
Revenge.
(chuckles) Bye, thanks. (To Jerry, when Susan is far) I can't believe she took the money.
You don't think I can keep a secret?
(Trying to whisper to Jerry) Look, we are gonna settle this right now! I demand reparations! I should get to sleep with Elaine. That's the only way to punish you!
What's the worst thing that could happen?
So? For a twenty-five dollar cleaning, I can listen to some pointless blather.
Parker, I never said driver, I said parker, a great parker.
I thought it was a date.
I don't know, I have to call her, tell her where we are. I'm very lucky she's even considering seeing me at all.
...I broke up with her.
All right, come on, come on, let's go. Six dollars.
A little breakfast.
For what?
Donna. Oh, youre the one that likes that commercial!
Y'know people, we got a situation over here!
Why should I care?
Me? You see what he did here, you see how he tried to sneak into my space?
Why not?
(admitting) All right..
Jerry, Elaine, I give you.. Janet.
Then I asked her if she wanted a drink.
No you wouldn't. Nobody would. It's just that... they were missing, and... well I'm just inquiring. (chuckles nervously)
'Maybe you know some little places to go, where they never close...'
So we're not going?
Hey, it's Georgie.
Nothing It's not you. It's me. I have a fear of commitment. I don't know how to love.
Cosmo?
(surprised) You know her name?
Yeah.
Hi, Carol.
Why don't you see someone about it?
Oh, when is that car service coming?
It.
Implied.
But suddenly, a new contender has emerged...
All right, all right.
Dont insult me, my friend. Remember who youre talking to. No ones a bigger idiot than me.
Wait a second, wait a second...and then the butler says, "I'm not cleanin' it up! I'm sick of cleaning!"
They asked you to do career day?
Dr. Sitarides don't go! Oh, thanks Jerry!
Alright?
Well you know there is an unusual number of people in this country having sex with AMPUTEES! (grabs the forum from Kramer and walks over to the clerk) . . . Penthouse forum, newspaper, gum, Clark Bar.
Jerry? Jerry! I'm busting! I'm busting!
What??
Hey, the Bull owes me one, I helped him with his swing.
Who invaded Spain in the Eighth Century?
I'm sorry the card says MOOPS.
Right here. (showing his lip)
Where, where? I can't see.
Does she care? No. Does anyone ever display the slightest sensitivity over the problems of a fellow individual? No. No. A resounding no!
Alright look, I'm gonna tell you, but I made a pact with Cynthia, we swore we were not going to tell you and Elaine.
You mean alias.
Woo! Some day out there - You ever see weather like that? Woo! It's crisp - it's crispy crisp.
So ... uh, squirrel.
He uh...doesn't have any running water?
(hearing Elaine over the phone) What, she's out?
How old's the son?
Newspaper.
Shocked?
I can't believe they actually found your stolen car.
See ya.
..Oh boy.
Hey, who's talking to you?
Oh, you lying little snot. And he's a cheater. Aren't ya' you little twerp?
Yes it is.
No, I don't know. How do I know the usual?
Yeah, my roommate in college.
Who are they?
Its my money. What should I do? Throw it out the window? I know a guy who took his vacation on his change.
They always make me take stock of my life. And how Ive pretty much wasted all of it, and how I plan to continue wasting it.
Oh, I, uh, I disagree. You've, uh, you've been living in America too long. (indicates the bag of oranges) You've forgotten what it's like to have no oranges.
Yeah, I better grab some too.
No wait, you can't just leave me here! Will I see you again?
You couldn't figure out the World's Theory for yourself? It's just common sense. Anybody knows, ya gotta keep your worlds apart. (gesturing with hands going outward)
Huh. Your renting a house in Tuscany?
Oh oh oh, all right, fine, Jerry, you win. Take it, just take it!
Really? That's pretty good.
Those birthdays. I told you. They're relationship killers. If a relationship is having any problems whatsoever, a birthday will always bring it out.
how did ya?...
Pretend you didn't know it was there. Can you see it?
What are you worried about, you know it.
(answering the phone while walking away) Joe Mayo's apartment?
It's worth a shot. (Goes to the door.)
I'm going shopping with Susan.
Well no not yet, you gotta buy french stamps (pauses) I-I'll reimburse you of course.
I'm not paying for this. If you were going out with her, it'd be a different story.
No, you're not out there.
Maybe you don't have to be so funny. I mean, would it kill you not to be so funny all the time? That's all I'm asking. This woman thinks I'm very funny. Now you're gonna be funny, so what am I gonna be? I'm gonna be a short bald guy with glasses who suddenly doesn't seem so funny.
Yes. Yes. You know what's interesting. The quarterback for the Atlanta Falcons is Bobby Hebert. No "r" which I find fascinating. You know it's Herbert h-e-r-b-e-r-t, Hebert h-e-b-e-r-t. "Hebert" it's a fun name to pronounce. Try and say it Hebert. Take a shot. All right. (check arrives) All right. I
So--ah, Kramer. Why'd you ask me out to dinner? (amused) An' why Pomodoro?
OK, OK, I never even had him for gym.
Quick. Get this thing back in the pizzeria
Eh, I can't. I gotta go down to the foundation. I'm interviewing high schoolers for the Susan Ross.. scholarship.
Sure, all right, what do you want?
Yeah, yeah.
Well ...... but how do I get someone else fired?
I bet they have more money than mine.
Aah! the minute I saw this girl, we just clicked. She's got such a nice face. hummmm her eyes, her mouth, nose
You know, it was really wrong of you to back out on that deal.
I love you, Jerry.
I dont get art.
Yeah, I'm gonna get a paper.
Hi,
What's that?
It just came to me.
It's George.
Oh, no...no, that's very bad for the kidneys.
The Lowers, really?
Sounds like a scam. (takes a bite from the granola bar)
Hey, Lainey, wanna see the horsey?
Heh, that's right. See ya later. (Exits.)
Of course not...
Elaine? It's me, George. (Elaine opens the door.) Hey, sorry to bother you so late. (To Billy) Hey! How ya doin.' (To Elaine) Uh, did you get any of those sponges?
Hey, where ya goin'?
You're my mother! What wouldn't I do for you?
I broke up with her.
Pleasuring you?
Oh, yeah?
Well, maybe it was Ghostbusters? Where ever it was, it worked!
No, no. No, no, no. It was not trash!
A-and don't settle for 145, you can do better, you're a genius. Heheheh (laughs)
He said that? (Daphne shacks her head) What a nerve. How dare he say something like that.
Yes, it was purple, I liked it, I dont actually recall considering the buttons.
I think that's what the back of closets are for.
Well I just stomped some pigeons in the park. They - they didn't move.
(more excitement) You were gonna fix me up with her?
What?
Why can't I have a heart attack? I'm allowed.
(a little worried) He uh, he doesn't have the auto shop any more?
Well. Gotta motor.
This pasta primavera is fabulous.
Hello?
Pop! POP!!
No.
So, uh, Mom, Dad, I was hoping that you could help me to remember my childhood a little clearly..
Never mind. The're done. All I have to do now is redo them. You know if you take everything I've ever done in my entire life and condense it down into one day, it looks decent.
No I'm not. I *was* bald.
Yes, as I see it.
(Getting up, he addresses Jerry) All right, remember no rust-proofing. Commit to nothing. If you have to speak - mumble.
I was squinting! Remember that drive from Wortsborough? (snapping his fingers) I was spotting those raccoons.
Told me to "Go to hell!" and I took the bus home.
(MUMBLING) You come to a parking lot, you write it down. How hard is that?
What time is it?
People smoke, Elaine. My mother smoked. It didnt hurt me.
Theres just no justice. This experience has changed me. Its made me more cynical, more bitter, more jaded.
Oh, sure. Of course. (looks for place to set down flowers) Um, uh, could you hold these? For just a second, just a second. (grabs newspapers from trash bin, begins wiping windshield) Here you go, now don't worry about a thing. It's gonna be fine. Here we go. Look at this shine.
Jody let's do this agian real soon (he tends his arms for a hug but she avoids him)
I'm not giving you the satisfaction. I'm gonna watch it again...
Once, to a dog. He licked himself and left the room.
Yeah, anyway, she's uh, having some kind of a family lunch, I'll swing by after.
Yeah.
Jerry, I like being with her. Plus, I know where she is all the time. I have relatively no competition. An-and you know how you live in fear of the pop-in?
(thoughtful) Downtown.
He's on vacation.
I like history. Civil War. Maybe I could be a professor, or something.
I agreed to become his butler.
Oh, Im Im full of it Father.
Yeah, "duty". Do you know how much duty is?
What-what are you doing?
Your friend is been accused of being a serial killer. I think that qualifies.
Thank you.
(whispering) Glenda, can I ask you a favor? Can I have this seat?
What's that?
Bosomy?
And now?
When I find that guy, this much I vow those glasses will be returned to their rightful owner.
A-ha, huh. (mumbles) tours.
How you gonna catch him? He's probably boarded the plane already.
Yeah, and I - I heard you got on their good side. Now, what'd you do?
Hamstring.
(Let down) Yeah, but you - you promised it to me.
From NBC?
Oh. How's she doing?
Oh, boy I was up to four in the morning watching the Omen trilogy.
129 west 81st street and hurry.
So you're moving there for spite!
OK Look, the gum isn't cutting it for me. We need to be about something else...anything..please.
Oh, it's beautiful. It's in sports.
I, I can't believe this is happening!
Yeah, yeah, me to miss -- I miss.
Well I think it would be nice if there was some kind of historical record of it.
Well, I didn't mean to hurt you kid.
Oh, yeah, sure, accident, right. She was aiming right at me like she was putting out a fire! Then, for the rest of the show, I'm sitting there with chocolate all over my shirt. Flies are landing on me. I'm boiling - I'm fantasizing all the things I'm gonna say when I see her. And later, finally, backstage when I talk to her, I'm a groveling worm. "What kind of chocolate was that? Do you throw any other foods?"
Susan B. Anthony** I think I'd have a problem with.
What? Must be a big one.
Well, uh... come in, come, come in. (frantically clears the couch of newspapers and crumbs)
Have you seen Jerry? (sitting beside Elaine) I told him two o'clock.
(to Susan's stone) ...And then, right after the All-Star Break, we, we just swept the Orioles. Four games. In Baltimore. (adjusts necktie nervously) So... yeah.
So, Elaine, are you going to sleep with me or what?!
I want to know how did that get into my car?
Did you tell her anything?
I don't see why's she more self-conscious about that than her toe thumbs.
So, you... you say you've been in the city all winter?
Its called Sendrax. Theyve got some new kind of technique for televising opera.
(angry undertone) Oh, I'm gonna give you a Royal bearing. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Lemme get a pack of gum here.
And get a picture of him, with his shirt off.
Where's the tamale guy?
You know what the temperature in Florida is today? Eh? Seventy-nine. That's almost eighty. Yeah, I read someplace the life expectancy in Florida is eighty-one and in Queens, seventy-three.
You know what I've come to realize? I'm not just bored. I genuinely dislike her.
Look, why couldn't you make me an architect? You know I always wanted to pretend that I was an architect. Well I-I'm supposed to see her tomorrow, I-I-I'm gonna tell her what's goin on. I mean maybe she just likes me for me.
Yes!
Pennypacker. Varnsen.
Carrie, could you do me a favour? Could you not mention this to your mother?
She thinks I'm ugly. I knew it.
Yeah.
No sports jacket? I don't need a sports jacket? Writers wear sports jackets.
I like (imitates Kramer) "cookies."
So?
What happened to the pact? We were both gonna change. We shook hands on a pact. Did you not shake my hand on it uh?
Christie? That's the one you met in the antique store?
What? What did you do?
Yeah, right.
But I-I-I-
Well I don't know anyone here Jerry. Where else am I going to stay?
There must be some way to find out.
No, No! She's going out with a friend of mine. It's only courteous that we should try and like each other.
That's what I'm trying to find out.
Why?
...It was all a terrible misunderstanding, sir. Just five minutes. Just five minutes of your time. (listens) Thank you! Thank you, Mister Dalrimple.
Yeah...
What?
hey nice move today
bowling! what do you say bowling? bowling's insane! bowling is crazy time
I don't want you to call.
Well, you know, It's interesting, you know, under that pressure, what you're capable of.
Shhh! Listen, you gotta do me a favor. Give me your wallet. I'll give it back to you later.
What do you think it's a bomb?
As you will see, the candy bar is paid for, and yet, remains dangling in the machine. (Notices that the Twix slot is completely empty) Hey, its gone. Where is my Twix? (Quickly looks around. His sights fall on the window of a door labeled "Employees Only". The same mechanic from before is eating a candy bar) What?! That guys eatin it!
I'm serious.
Pssh. Yeah. Right.
Don't worry, I got it.
Hi Elaine
So you feel okay?
Funny guy, huh?
Yeah!, a doodle of me...look at the size of the nose , the ears, all my features are distorted.
I can't
(still worried) He was pretty emphatic?
Her back went out. She's gotta be there for a couple of days. All she said on the way over in the car was, "Why, George, why?!".. I said, "Because it's there!"
Look...
Excuse me, do you have a ticket?
Now I remember, as I jumped over the hole I heard a, like a jingling sound.
I've got to tell you, I'm really disappointed in Lupe.
Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot. I'll pay you back.
Oh, I think so, and I can prove it. You see, I was doodling on the bill and uh, so if you have a twenty in there with big lips on it... well, (smiles) that's mine. Would you mind opening up the register?
Uh, Jerry, you want your blankets tucked in?
I think he was impressed.
I had a great time tonight Carrie. And I am going to call you as soon as I get home.
There you go.
Jerry, it's me, George, don't worry, I'll return it
Are you through?
Hey, you like?
(Laughs) Steven, nothing is higher than an architect.
I feel like I got a B12 shot. This is like a taste explosion!
Should be a while though.
We have a, three-o'clock appointments.
Kramer's so stringy. I'm plump, juicy.
No, you're not taking a deli slicer to my boss...
I know enough to stay away from it.
I gotta call her. Should I call her?
Jerry, would you make the call already?
Maybe we could call them and ask them to return it.
What do you need her for? There's a million lawyers.
(wondering where this is leading) No sir.
She any good?
Coming to the airport with us?
Oh, God...
Well, I'm sure they'll be able to fix it. You can't stop modern science. Can't stop it, you can't stop it. Can't stop science. Can't be stopped, no way, no how, science just marches--
So, you want to come down to Mario's Pizza with me and help me pick up the Frogger?
I think that's Mr. Hayman. ...The gym teacher from our High School.
Well, I'm just expressing my gratitude to our gracious host.
Twenty years? That long?
But I was thinking...T-bone.
(confessing) Well, actually, I thought it up on the way over here.
What, you mean you know about this?
My parents are moving to Florida!
(thinking) Oh my God, it's 701. What have I done? My whole plan is depending on Kramer? Have I learned nothing? How could I make such a stupid mistake? He'll never show up!
What's that?
I think I'll have a piece of cake.
I see what you mean.
Did you feel that tension? We use to have banter - (puts menu back with frustration) - there's no more banter.
Well, that's really not fair.
So what do you want me to do?
Alright, I'll tell you the truth. I'm not gay. My name's Buck Naked, I'm a porno actor.
Just nice?
I did?
Ah, that is disgusting--
Of course I'm all right. I'm here with my girl, Nina. And what better way to pass the time than gabbing with my best friend -- with whom there are no secrets. (Flashes two intertwined fingers) Like this. Since the fourth grade.
Hey, Lloyd. (Shakes hands with Lloyd) How's it going? (chuckles)
"Cold showers? They're for psychotics."
My story?
I don't.
People are looking for tickets here?
It's nothing.
Listen, I have a tremendous favor to ask.
We have no need to speak. We communicate with deep soulful looks.
(pointedly) She could do a lot worse than Mr Peanut, my friend.
So she starts vaccuming, back and forth, back and forth, her hips swivelling, her breasts, uh... (trying to think of a word)
The woman we bought the wheelchair for?
100 p.m. Do you need any money?
Okay.
And ah, Ill have the bacon club without the turkey. (raises eyebrows)
Are you kidding? I lie every second of the day. My whole life is a sham!
I was curious! (imitating his moms voice)
Yeah.
Ah ha, well, I really wouldn't know about that. I don't watch much TV. I like to read. So what do you do, a lot of that "did you ever notice?" this kind of stuff.
That's a little steep don't you think?
Well, go ahead, tell him.
Jerry! Over here Jerry. It's me!
What'd you ask me for?
It's not a pet! It's a wild invalid! And it knows that I tried to kill it. As soon as it gets better, it's gonna gnaw my brain out in my sleep!
That's right.
Help! Someone!
No, no, no, no.
No. Thanks, dad.
Hey! (to Elaine, who doesn't look too cheerful)
Can she talk?
It's...gotta hurt! Hurt! Because...Aaarrrrrgh!
(thoughtful) Breakdown, huh?
"Whhhoooo!!!!"(taps on his desk loudly)
Of course not. You don't care what I look like.
Excuse me, are you the guy with that funny laser?
Thats all there is to it. By Christmas day I will be Brother Costanza.
Yeah, but if you still look closely you can see ah, a little bump where the nose use to be. huhuhuhu.
Oh, would ya stop worrying?
(getting up out of his chair to get out of the Mohel's way) No, No.
Where's the remote phone?
No.
Zing.
Peter?
Did you explain to her about the good naked and the bad naked?
huh you tell her
Yeah. (Points to two open seats in front of Jerry's. To Nina) Sit down there. (Sees Jerry in the crowd) Hello, Jerry. (Obviously angered at Jerry) I believe you know Nina.
Thank you! Thank you very much. (Jerry and Melissa stop and look at George)
The better looking they are, the faster they go! I mean, I see they out there on the street, they're zooming around, like a blur. Like they have a motor on their ass.
Something like that.
Oh my God!
It's George.
Look at this sparkle. (looks up, sees Lindsay's mother) Mrs. Enright! (runs after her) Mrs. Enright! Mrs. Enright!
Hey, whats goin on?
Mr. Tuttle, you're back.
I had no idea.
Look at this.
Please, it doesnt look good. Boy, boy, girl.
Okay.
Right, your friend Roy.
Maybe you should call your car phone.
We just came from Chadway's(?) What's going on.
Nobody's faking.
They want you to do a TV show?
Fine, I'll make an appointment. (He leaves)
Id like to help, but my neck..
Alright, so, we need something..
It's a performance, Jerry. Like what you do.
Right.
Look, I guarantee she won't know.
Absolutely.
Hey.
And you're watching the fight at Jerry's?
Elaine's coming up?
(adamant) It's smart. It's a smart line, and a smart crowd will appreciate it. (shouting) And, I'm not gonna dumb it down for some bonehead mass audience!
What? What are you talking about.
He's a great writer.
Yeah. Yeah. With all that kissing and the shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy out in public like that. It's disgusting!
With the two of us?
I'll tell you what. Why don't we just get a couple of dishes and we'll just share 'em.
(Confused) What photo?
Yeah, and she's going to find I'm a moron. You know, people think I'm smart, but I'm not smart.
It was very traumatic. The last thing I remember is you flinching. Then, everything went black.
Check that out (showing newspaper)
25 kids for his birthday party? (to kid under table) Don't put your tongue on the floor! He's putting his tongue on the floor! Here, here, have some more sugar packets. (tosses some Equal packets under the table)
(remorsefully) I can't go.
See her tonight. See her tomorrow. Go. Knock yourself out. Shes too crazy for me.
Hey - What's going on?
Take care. Take it easy. (Tom leaves with the casting director)
Because I... I love you.
Lemme tell you sum'in. When Ponce looked in that mirror and saw that he hadn't changed, and that tear started to roll down his cheek? ... I lost it.
What?
(frustrated) No. No, no, no. You're not helping me.
Anyway, I think the guy in the shower opposite saw me. He gave me a dirty look.
She doesn't want to get a bra.
I'm sorry, umm he-here's your money back (gives Rudy the money back) I-I-I'll have the clothes.
Hey.
All right, shes not even gonna ask, if we see her, which is remote.
Yeah, sure. I was showing a condo on 48th street. Besides, you think I wanna miss this? (chuckles)
I'm, you know, engaged.
This is all too much. So what are you feeling? What's going on? Are you like a couple again now?
And I'm moving out of my parents' house, I'm taking that apartment on 86th street, remember the one we saw?
(Not amused with her answer) Eggs are eggs. That is very profound. (laughs; Daphne goes back to reading her paper) By the same token you could say fish is fish. Ha ha ha, I don't think so. (pauses) Listen Dophne
Well, cause we were just saying we were going to ask you to come up to the country with us this weekend. Susan's father has a cabin up there. But, eh, all right, well.
It is. I'm just not ready yet.
Very exciting, very exciting, it's like watching a birth.
Really?
Who?
No, I uh... I use it.
Yes we will.
Bread.
hey, you know what? I just remembered something. I had a dream about that guy last night. This is amazing.
Is that right?
And the Christian rock?
All right, relax, tough guy. I got to go out to my father's garage, help him sell some computers.
Yeah, is he still mad at you for crashing his Thanksgiving party?
She said "sweep together" you idiots, not "sleep together."
(Ironing) You don't wanna know.
Why is that?
Oh, Schumann. Of course.
(feigning happiness) The second I see him.
Jerry, please?
(Needing to get away from his parents, he gets up) I need some air..
She's confiding in him about our dates. You always like the person you talk to about the date more than the date! It's just a matter of time till they realize, 'Hey, we could have sex.'
It doesn't matter if it's more comfortable. It's wrong.
Theres no way I touch that bag for less than two dollars.
He didnt seem too pleased.
I told you.
I don't want hope. Hope is killing me. My dream is to become hopeless. When you're hopeless, you don't care, and when you don't care, that indifference makes you attractive.
(incredulous) You can't ground me, I'm a grown man.
All right. You understand now? It's not that complicated.
No no. That's not what I was trying to do.
Maybe this is what the pilot should be about, vomiting on somebody's vest.
Yes funny (laughs; hand clap) let's go.
He chose the cats?
It moved! It was imperceptible but I-I felt it.
(Identifying what Jerry said) Clint Eastwood!
Lemme see this. (Tries to grab the papers.)
What do you think about a rocking chair?
No. Definitely not.
Why didn't you just say that?
Well, what's the reason?
Huh?
Yeah, listen, I can't make it later.
Wow. So what're you gonna do?
Ill eh, Ill just have a bowl of chili.
So?
Nobody tucks anymore.
That's it.
You know, you go out, you get another rye. Of course, it would have to be the same one from Schnitzer's. You put it in the kitchen somewhere and you say Ohh! There it is.
(bursting out of the bathroom, fumbling with his fly) Button fly! Why do they put buttons on a fly? It takes ten minutes to get these things open!
Cold? How are you going to do that? You're not one of those guys.
No. So, tonight she's got tickets for that show she's been working on. The Flying Sandos Brother.
Hey! (heads toward bathroom)
Yeah well, we don't think.
Huh. (Makes a "over his head" gesture with his arm) C'mon, let's go, go. We got a lot of work to do today.
Who wears a cape?
I do.
Jerry, I need to borrow your camera.
Ow! Dad...
How did you get all this?
Exactly! Because neither one of us can't handle a woman all by ourselves.
Hennigans. I was there sitting in the office and the cleaning woman comes in. I've always been attracted to cleaning women. Cleaning women, chambermaids.
So, what's happening with the TV show? You come up with anything?
Yeah.
When I was ten years old, my parents had this very same statue on the mantle of our apartment. Exactly. And, one day, I grabbed it, and I was using it as a microphone. I was singing, MacArthur Park, and I got to the part about, Ill never have that recipe again, and it slipped out of my hand and it broke. My parents looked at me like I smashed the ten commandments. To this day, they bring it up. It was the single most damaging experience in my life, aside from seeing my father naked.
Oy uy uy.. (Antonio points to the sink) We really should get going.
Boy, these are really bad details.
You bought that?
That I'm used to. (he leaves)
I can't believe it. He's going! He's fired!
You got a line in the Woody Allen movie?
Okay.
Oh, Tara!
What did I get the veggie burger for? You got a veggie burger, so I had to get the veggie burger, I'm allover crums...
Yeah, yeah. You gotta come over tonight. We can play.
Yeah?
Uncle Leo's having regular sex?
Five minutes. What the hell happened here?
(meekly) Well, it's true. I saw it.
Carol, thats so rude. Please, Im serious, just for a moment, if you wouldnt mind. And then well talk to Jerry.
It's not the same.
Well, I don't see why if you have his, he should have yours.
Oh yeah, right. When's he coming back?
Is that how you're gonna say it?
I don't understand lunch, I don't know anything about lunch. Listen. Just because I got the guy fired doesn't mean I turned him into a bum - does it?
(to Jerry, yelling) You told her? She's not your wife!
I'm, uh, George Costanza. I was having dinner with your son.
Me?
(grunting) Hey! Hey, wait a second. I got an idea.
If I do it, will you buy a computer?
What does she look like?
Rudy?! That skunk, I knew he didn't burn those clothes.
Right now?
What happened? Did he bring it up?
Why, you think I should?
... Susan.
Did you ask her?
Dad, that other car cut us off! They had swastikas all over it... They were hurling racial epiphates at us... I could have been killed!
You're telling me. (he walks around and the suit makes a swooshing sound) So, what do you think?
I know what you're going through. Women. Who knows what they want?
Hello, Rick.
How could they not notice it?!?
(dramatically) A what?
You would not believe what just happened. I was waiting for you and this woman was sitting at the counter.
Oh - I've got something.
Look at all of those! You're rich!
Start looking for a job.
She's playing a recital this week at the McBierney School. You wanna hear her play? I got two extra tickets, you and Elaine could go...
You sure?
No doors?
Nice nun.
Duncan Meyers?
We got a deal.
here Elaine here, Superman (hands a comic book to Elaine, who passes it to Tony) please, next time it will only be the two of us
Oh, I was uh, I was waiting downstairs for the jackhammer, thought I'd drop by.
Two fifty? Are you sure
Everything goes with naked.
Ha Haaaaaaa... Jerry how do you like that.You see I get myself in a dizzy, I'm all worked up and for what?
Really?
The Day..
Because I'm a cheater! I had to tell you.
Well I didnt do it for my mother.
(Shrugging it off) She'll be fine. I gotta go to the hospital to see her tonight.
Yeah, that's right.
Oh yeah HA-A-A, HA-A-A.
I have mourned for three long months! Summer months, too! Anybody could grieve in January! It's time for George to start being George again.
Do you? That makes me so happy. Elaine's proud of me Jerry.
I was moving it across the street, I looked up and I saw Woody Allen and I got all distracted.
Really? ..You think.
What about your old car? They couldn't get Kramer's blood out of it?
I'm getting nothing.
Jerry. I can't get fired.
Ha! (snort) Can you believe it? (amused) I'm supposed to be havin' lunch with her right now at Pomodoro.
Hey, maybe this cheating thing is what I could use to ditch Maura.
You know what? it's better than Elaine's, too. I gotta give her a call. (Moves tward the phone)
That's unbelievable.
A preemptive breakup. This is an incredible idea. I got nothing to lose. We either break up which she would do anyway but at least I go out with some Dignity. Completely turn the tables. It's absolutely brilliant.
Jerry, I can't talk to Jerry anymore. Ever since he moved into that apartment he's too much ... like you.
What?
L-Look at this?
(wiping the area with a hand) People think they're so important...
Well, OK. As I said the guy had it in for me. He actually failed me in gym. ... ME!
Well, I am not going.
Oh yeah.
I got your calzones Mr. Steinbrenner.
Elaine, can I just explain something to you very privately here? Susan and I have been together many, many times now, and just between you and me, there's really no big surprises here, so...make-up sex is all that I have left.
Gammy's gettin' upset!
You paying my hotel and airfare to Miami?
They did?
(seeing Elaine and Puddy come into Monk's) Yeah. Hey, Lainie, Puddy.
Oh, my God...
Ow!
W-What? What?
Uh, it was dangling! There were only two left in the machine! He mustve bought one, and gotten both.
Kramer?
Come on, wanna give me a hand with the computers?
Because I asked you to.
Fish. What do they do?
Elaines moving into your building?
(laughing) Have something else. Cmon, have a little dessert?
All right. See you tomorrow. (George sighs, exits.)
(Sliding over to make room for her) Sit down. Join us, please.
Well, then, I am gonna have to ask you to turn your key.
(hopeful) So, details?
How's this for criticism? Um...you stink. How do like that criticism? You know what's funny to me? That diploma up on the wall. That is my idea of "com-med-dee"! You sitting here, telling people what to do.
Fine. (hits his arm on the desk) Ow!
What happened to Babs. She never showed up last night. The whole thing blew up in my face.
You yearn.
George Costanza. Susan's, uh, friend? Long time no speak.
So I finally stop and say, "Tatiana, I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but I think it would be best if I left".
What?
I know. I know. That's what I do. That's what I do.
How's it going?
What?
So, much longer?
No. This is not cotton. Here, lemme see. (Tries to look at the tag on the uniform. Tartabull gets creeped out and resists.) Will you stop it? (Looks at the tag.) Oh. Of course. Polyester!
Aw, she's gonna be a fine sailor.
(jubilant) Five thousand dollars? She doesnt have five thousand dollars!
(getting up) Can I keep this?
Na no, I'm not good in these situations. I can't hide my pity. I..I make em feel worse.
(crouches too) What? Where? Where?
What were you doing?
Yeah, the neck hole thing, and I would appreciate it if you would say you're sorry.
I gotta go zoo. I feel like I could set more of my own schedule.
No.
All right You really want to know?...It all started when she told met hat...she was the voice on your tape recorder.
Well why don't you take off your hat and stay awhile.
How so? I'll tell you how so. She's bald!
Hate those couples. I could never bee one of those couples. There are no bald woman around. You know?
No. No way.
What do you mean?
So, uh...wanna double?
I just thought of a great name for myself, if I ever become a porno actor.
I don't even know Peterman. How the hell am I gonna relax? I'm gonna have to be on all night. I don't like being on, Jerry, I would much rather be off.
There was a woman, Audrey. She had a very big nose.
Well, they were in a rush.
And you! How many Twix does that make for you, today?! Like, 8 Twix?!
(Leading Nina out the airport) Oh, no. No. We're good. Let's get goin'. Alright. (Almost bumps into Jerry) Watch it, funny man. (Leaves)
I-I don't get these birds! They're breaking the deal. It-it's like the pigeons decided to ignore me!
Right. (Mumbles) Nastercoff.. What country is he from, again?
What, do you pay him for that?
Is that tolerable?
How'd you get that?
No? Are you crazy?
So, you need me to get fired.
Right!
Hey, wanna get some lunch?
I say fourteen o nine (1409).
It's really nothing, it's like going to the dentist.
9... 1... 1. She said she'd do anything. Hello, police? Uh, yeah listen, we're in the back of a limo in Queens--
Cmon. Wilkinsons got millions invested in this stock. Its gone up three points since Ive been watching it.
Oh no no no no - we have to be in California next week. We're starting a TV show.
(Thomassoulo helps George get up) Yeah, what the hell.
Hello.(with not a big smile)
LBJ?
Popcorn?
Where we gonna eat?
uh.. maana? huh maana might.. huh maana might be a problem, I'm supposed to have huh a boil lanced maana. Huh you know I think they charge me if I cancel with only one maana's notice
That?s not the issue, we're friends, if I?ve got to be uncomfortable, you've got to be uncomfortable too!
(Yelling out to the whole coach) Funny guy! (Points to Jerry) Right here!
Oh, the hell with it. Let him kill me. I..
No, no I do. You know it's just...
(Defensively) He knows how to read. And he also knows finishing an entire book doesn't prove anything. And get this he's into architecture.
And then I hear this rabbi on television, I mean imagine.
(Still on the hot water) What about shaving?
And you're the shark?
Yes, yes, I definitely waited. But let me say this Once he passes on that option, that 'God bless you' is up for grabs.
Don't go shouting we got a hundred dollar bill. People will be jumping out of windows on top of us.
She thinks I'm a nice guy. Women always think I'm nice, but women don'tnice.
I don't know. I don't think you're anything.
I'll die out here.
Wink.
Prognosis Negative! (in a funny voice)
Baah! There it is! You just said it! That's what I want! Now say it again, and tell it to me.
You're not goin to do it? What do you mean, You're not goin to do it?
Oh ya, This is my fiance, Susan. This is David
Oh, yes. I - I'm your baby bluey.
Yeah, here you go.
I think hitting a defenseless child is my business.
You did all this...for a pinky toe?
Wow. What'd you say?
Hey! Did 'ya ever do that thing on the toes that I said .
Instinct.
The guy never came back.
It's a little unusual. So, uh, Susan and I were thinking, uh, dinner at our house Saturday night. Just the four of us.
Knock it off, just sit in your seat over there you're distracting me. We're making incredible time here. I once went into Kennedy Airport from West 81st Street to in uh, in 15 minutes. hu uh. Oh, here hold this. It's uh, ten dollars for the tolls.
What was that all about?
Huh, really? How bad? Was he on his death bed?
Would you get out of here. Who's gonna turn down a chair? I would be very interested to know how he felt about all of this. Maybe I'll have a talk with him.
If you want.
Was she mad?
And this is Kramer.
Oh..
Nope!
Uh, twice what youre payin here, but its a great building. Its two bedrooms!
Right now? "Jerry"?
I told you.
So I set up a screening, everyone takes their shirt off and click, I snap me a shot of a bear-chested Kruger.
Jerry.
He never finished the sentence. He got a call, that was the end of the interview.
(sitting down) Vacation?
Whatever. Listen, I'm very concerned about this guy.
Well, I have to see her.
Clark Bar.
(shouts) Awright already!! This is a very key issue with me, Jerry. I had this name for a long time.
I take an eye test; I flunk it, the next thing you know I am swinging to the sweet sounds of risk management.
You do.
Peggy! (they all sit) His daughter Peggy. Peggy's coming over to serve.
I've looked at that, seems unlikely.
I got to tell you I felt terrible. I really thought she was going to collapse and kill herself.
Oh, they're busting!
(hurriedly leaves Rudy's) They had plans, They had plans!
Eat me alive, huh? We'll see who can make it in *this* town.
Learn guitar, first lesson free? Huh.
Pasta primavera.
I mean, now she thinks that I'm one of these guys that love her. Nobody wants to be with somebody that loves them.
Just do it like a Band-Aid. One motion. Right off! (beat) She is sexy though. Dont you think?
Gimme half!
All right, if she puts the bags down before she greets you, thats a good sign.
(Inquiring about the chalk board) What is this?
Great, great. So anytime you want you can just visualize her naked.
Lingerie?
I dont understand, you never talk to her about other women?
I gotta go.
Potato
How could she leave us alone with this lunatic? Ten more minutes, and thats it! Im leaving. I have to tell you, this guy scares me.
Would you stop that please. Would you just stop that?
So she's gorgeous.
No no no no no, this has to be carefully orchestrated. You go to a fancy dinner, flowers...
I really can not comprehend how stupid people could be sometimes. Can you comprehend it?
How 'bout Kramer.
Siena, I love you.
Let me just see it for a second.
We'll have a good time
No.
Y'know there are tribes in Indonesia where if you keep your coat on in somebody's house, the families go to war!
(negative) Hu-ho, boy.
(sarcasm) Hu-hu, like I don't know that? (excitement) My Cousin Vinnie, I love that! I, George Costanza, could be on a date with an Oscar winner! An Oscar winner, Jerry! You know what that's like? It's like if fifty years ago, someone fixed me up with Katherine Hepburn? Same thing!
Thats beautiful.
What do you think I mean bald? Bald. Bald bald.
Severance package...The Yankees are giving me three months full pay for doing nothing.
Oh.
Oh, I dont get the enthusiastic hi, Im outta there.
(pauses for a few seconds) OK, I'm tellin' you right now - if your kiddin' around I'm not gonna be able to be your friend anymore. I'm serious about that. You got that.
I, uh, should have a poem very soon now.
Looks pretty good.
What a mind.
Yes.
I believe you cut me off, and then made an obscene gesture.
I like to stop at the duty free shop!
You didnt say "junior".
Jerry, this whole Ellen situation.. has gone far enough.
(TO WOMAN) Hey, is that necessary?
Oh, this is great.
Muffin, sandwich and coffee!
It's nothing, stop it..
Ooh, so what?
Absolutely. You're telling me there's no room to move on pasta. All starches are a scam.
I am aware!
Oh, oh, your papers
Huh. Really?
What do you think?
Because he said I was going to.
Wait a minute, she did a skin cancer screening at Peterman?
Hey.
My regular face.
Oh, no no no, I haven't even seen her apartment yet. Tomorrow night's the first night.
(offers his) Oh, you want to taste mine.
Hey!.. What can I tell ya.
You remember my cousin Rhisa? I'm gonna date her.
Yeah,yeah!! I'll pick you up right now.....All right All right....Hey! gotta go.
If it makes you happy, I don't focus on these things. I will tell you this Unfortunately, we live in a very superficial society. I don't condone it, but it's a fact of life.
Lupe. That's very nice, very nice. Listen, are you going to be making up the bed in the morning?
Yes?
Yes, I know so. You happen to be a very eligible lesbian.
Yes, I agree. I hope my parents go long before I do.
(enthusiastic) Yeah. You get a couch. I get rid of my father. It couldn't be more perfect!
I mean, they're retired.
(still quiet) Never mind, never mind. I need you to do me a favour. Uhm, remember what we were talking about at the coffee shop earlier?
Yeah. I had a great time.
I'm going straight to hell, no two ways about it.
Oh, no no no no. Go ahead, Pop, you always knew your cars.
What are you, crazy? You were fine.
(Putting his jacket on) I'd like to apologize. I want to tell him I.. I.. didn't mean to get him in trouble.
You went for the big "E".
Jerry, I gotta talk to you.
Hide, hide under the desk.
An apartment-warming gift? We got to give presents to people for moving? Birthdays, Christmas, it's enough gifts. I would like one month off.
(sobbing) yodel lay hee hoo..
Jerry. Jerry.
We, uh, we go on foot from here.
Fifty bucks a month, that's incredible! Okay, thanks.
nothing
Well at least you accomplished something. You got fish.
We cant just let him get away with this.
ah.
A knife?
Ah. You see, the man who was the butler, uh, had gotten into a car accident with Jerry, and because he didn't have any insurance, the judge decreed that the man become Jerry's butler.
Yeah, yeah. You really cashed in on that favor pretty quick.
(hangs up the phone) That's my toaster. I got to go. Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh!
Well, was it for Costanza or...
One of the guys in my cell threw a piece of gum at him.
I tell you what, you give me the twenty, and I will buy *you* a popcorn and soda, and I'll throw in a bon-bons.
Continue.
This is *unbelievable* B.O.
Well, unless you tell everybody you're dating.
All right, I made up the part about the car, but the rest is true. And he hated me anyway!
Ok, we got your...got your strawberries, your chocolate sauce, your pastrami on rye with mustard, your honey...
Well it's not fair, Jerry. It's just not fair. All right, all right. That's it. I'm getting out of this thing.
(whistles disapprovingly) Ho ho ho, Had to? Had to come in?
Squirrel? Well, we have no deal with THEM!
So it was a good experience.
Do you believe this? We're fighting. We're fighting.
What is this?
No, Seven.
So, Im thinking, as shes saying this, Im thinking great, the relationships over. But the egg salads on the way. So now I have a decision Do I walk or do I eat?
(excited) So then, as we were leaving, we were just kind of standing there, and she was sort of smiling at me, and I wasnt sure if she wanted me to ask her out, because when women smile at me I dont know what it means. Sometimes I interpret it like theyre psychotic or something and I dont know if Im supposed to smile back, I dont know what to do. So I just stood there like  remember how Quayle looked when Benson gave him that Kennedy line? Thats what I looked like.
What are you like a sadist? No matter how bad somebody feels, you can make 'em feel worse. I bet you're rooting for a tumor. (pointing to her)
He didnt do anything, Jerry. Its a scam! Who told you to do that?
Yeah. I think we really go something here.
Yeah.
(shouting) I'm not looking for another line. I got the line.
What happened to Mrs. Krantz?
I don't understand what the big deal is. They let you try on pants.
My receipts! The chair! My tiger poster!
Oh, what time is it? Eight thirty? I'll tell you what's on. You got Major Dad, Blossom, very funny programme...
I'm getting married?
(to the woman) Boy, I have to get to a bathroom.
Do you have something a little more... less expensive?
What the hell happened?
(laughs) Youd have to be a real loser to try something like that.
Hi, I need some party invitations.
You dont like tippy toe?
Well, I know when I'm a little strapped, I sometimes drop off my rent check having forgotten to sign it. That could buy us some time.
I think those are my socks!
There's elevators all over! It all looks the same.
That's pretty long.
(to Carrie) You know, the thing is, I kinda promised the widow Mantle that I would name my baby Seven.
(smitten) Audrey? My god, you look incredible! I can't believe it!
I got about fifty-feet out and suddenly, the great beast appeared before me. I tell ya he was ten stories high if he was a foot. As if sensing my presence he let out a great bellow. I said, "Easy big fella!" And then, as I watched him struggling I realized, that something was obstructing its breathing. From where I was standing I could see directly into the eye of the great fish!
He's an importer.
We had an incredible phone conversation. We talked for like twenty minutes. I threw away my notes in the middle of the call. You know, I thought she had a great voice timbre. Is it timbre or tamber?
51 people?! That's it?! I thought it was, like, a thousand!
You got odds.
I don't know. This sandwich is making me flush.
(standing up, still acting) Uhh! I'm caught in my own web of lies! (holds his hands up in surrender)
He scratches off a 32 and he puts in 31.
Pretty chintzy, huh? Considering the money she makes.. She's a big executive for Federal Express.
No forget the story.
It was you!
I am such a Huge whale fan. These marine biologists were showin' how they communicate with each other with these squeaks and squeals, what a fish!
I, I couldnt wait. I was too anxious to see you.
Yeah, as a matter of fact, I did.
No, no you really look great.
All right -- (Gets up to leave)
Yeah, yeah I really had some guts back then. Why don't we do it again?
Yeah.
(Modestly) Forget it.
How much tip do you leave on $8.15?
Tell you what, I'll make a deal with you. I'll sell it to you right now for ten bucks.
Oh my God it is them.
Why?
??? sir.
No no no no, you have to approach this as if he was a woman.
What do you want?
So you think you can put the suit aside and hold it for me?
(animated) Are you insane? Jerk store, woulda smoked that guy! Smoked him, I say.
Ha! (grabs his coat and exits the apartment)
What kind of a shake does he have?
40? I'm payin' 60 to my maid. She doesn't do laundry and I'm gettin' nothin'. All right. Once she pinched my ass, but I don't know what that was.
That?s-that?s-Harry Fong, he's a very good friend of mine and he's a big opera buff. Enjoy the show there harry!... You know what.
It's not me! It's the car!
Tell me.
Busted cold.
How could you do that?!
Wish I could help you.
No, not nice. She's stickin' it to me.
He's not here?
I don't understand women.
I suppose if I had suggested Liam Neeson Day, you'd all be patting me on the back.
Well good, good. Take it off you're going to wear it out already. It's for special occasions this thing.
(To Jerry) No, it's about nothing.
Yeah, no pop-in, no "in the neighborhood," no "I saw your light was on." And the best part is, if things go really well...
What do you mean?
Oh the ego on you.
It's OK. It's fine. She'll do it. I'm sure she'll still do it.
Hey
Right
Id love to go. Make an appointment.
Do you ever just get down on your knees and thank god that you know me and have access to my dementia?
Will they give us cash?
(Shocked) You caved?!
I know! I was squinting.
They're all the same. You go, you sit, you eat popcorn, you watch. I'm sick of it.
Oh!
What if she discusses it with Jane?
What are you talking about.. I WANT MY CAR!!
Ahh, Hey-Ho. ahhhhh (exhales)
This thing can't hurt me, can it? I mean, it is a laser. What if it hits my eye?
The third?
A pig-man?
It's like the manager coming out and asking you for the ball.
It's not that long, really.
I am staying out all night!
(grabbing his jacket) Hey oo, I just remembered uh my parents really wanna have you guys over for dinner before you leave town. What about tonight?
It's fine, we'll just meet him at the bubble boy's house.
Ah, get outta here. The vomiting is much funnier.
(to Jerry) Oh, get outta here.
Don't you understand? It's not about him. To have a line as perfect as 'jerk store' and to never use it. I, I couldn't live with myself.
I tell you something. I wish there were pig-men. You get a few of these pig-men walking around suddenly I'm looking a whole lot better. Then if somebody wants to fix me up at least they could say, "Hey he's no pig-man!"
Shut up! Shut up!
What?
(excited, pushing Jerry forward) All right, let's go, let's go, let's go, come on.
A counter-clockwise swirl.
(fever pitch) Marisa Tomei's sitting home, Elaine! Wh..why didn't you tell me that Katy was friends with Marisa Tomei?!
I know it's a doll, but it looks like my mother!
All right, just gimme that. And gimme some of those Sweet & Lows.
Maybe they forgot to put it out!
You ditched me. That's twice. Now I demand to know what's going on!
Yeah. Just take 'em out and ride 'em around for about..half an hour.
There putting in a lost and found because of me. There's a time limit but still.
Sperry Rand Building. 14th floor, Morgan Apparel. Mention my name - she'll give you the key.
you put him on the spot
What about candle holders?
Let me ask you something. When you go into a store, does it bother you that they make the security guard just stand there all day?
What are you, a doctor?
What? You mean with a knife?
It it's huge. It's probably like North Dakota.
Hey, a "hit" is a totally different story.
What is that, immigrants come over, you show them how to act natural?
No one gives us the finger! We're Yankees!
I have to say, as a glasses wearer I take exception to that. That's like me buying a wheelchair to cruise around in.
All right. (tearing his jacket off) Let me just say one thing there is no way that this is gonna happen. You hear me? No Way! Because if you think I'm going' to two Thanksgivings, you're out of your mind!!!
Whoa, whoa, a section?!
Who was he?
Me too, really. Unless you'd really like to get one.
Maybe somebody did it and didn't take credit for it. Maybe it was already done and didn't need doing in the first place. I have no idea who did it, what they did, or how they did it so well. And you know what? Jimmy crack corn and I don't care.
What? Too short?
[embarrassed pause] ``Rochelle, Rochelle''.
(startled) Oh!
Now everyone's going to think we're gay!
I wanna bite into a big hunk of cheese, just bite into it like it's an apple.
So he... had his hands and, uh, he was uh
So, what? We're gonna do nothing now, this is crazy.
The point is I was here first.
No, not nervous. I'm good, very good. (A beat, then he snaps) I can't do this! Can't do this!
Tightness..
She missed her period? Oh my god. I can't believe it! I'm a father! I did it! My boys can swim! I can do it! I can do it!
Well, maybe she decided to celebrate her birthday on the Monday after the weekend.
You're not going to get back here in time!
Maybe they're Wilt Chamberlain's.
(can't be heard but looks like) Kramer!
(to Jay) What do you think it is?
I am eating my dessert. How do you eat it, with your hands?
I'm sure he'll be back in a second.
Peterman? Nobody mentioned anything about Peterman.
Ha.
The catering hall screwed up. The wedding is delayed until June. It's like a stay of execution.
Of course you can.
And now for the trifecta. (Picks up a hand held TV and gets back under the covers.)
Oh, this is my friend, Jerry Seinfeld. I just bumped into him around the corner. Isnt that a coincidence? The funny thing is, I see him all the time.
Exactly.
Do you hear yourself?
You know, it's a miracle you're not married. (beat) Hey, I'm not obligated to buy anything, am I?
"To the victor goes the spoils." What are you going to do tonight?
Who am I going to meet who is better than her? No one, Jerry. No one's better than her.
Why not?
See now that bothers me even more than dying bothers me, cause it's people like you who live to be a hundred and twenty because you're not bothered by it. How could it not bother you?
Boy, my knuckles are still cramped from that football game.
I think I can sum up the show for you with one word NOTHING.
Waffle maker.
Dad, he doesn't need to see the pole.
How ya doin'?
About a year ago. Wedding invitations.
Well, I'm sorry!
I am never saying 'I love you' again unless they say it first.
I'll pay you for your time....I just ..I just need some information . How much do you want? ten....fifteen? You have change for twenty?
So, she's the loser of the group. Every group has someone that they all make fun of.. Like us with Elaine. (Jerry thinks about this, then shakes it off)
I didn't get any bread.
Well, I'm gonna go back there later and return it when there's different people working.. You want to catch a movie?
I know, swan dives from twenty floors up, lands right on top. What do I got a bulls eye up there? He couldn't move over two feet? Land on the sidewalk. It's city property.
Don't worry. We won't forget!
Had to come in and maybe well get together? Had to and maybe?
Imagine if I had to see them both on the same day? (mirthless) Haha! It's like runnin' a double marathon!
Oh, it's the chicken and the egg...
Stop it! It's nothing. It's a stupid holiday my father invented. It doesn't exist!
'cause I asked him about the raisins.
I'm not getting a Penthouse Forum.
I mean it's gotten to the point where I'm flirting with operators on the phone. I almost made a date with one.
She had this throaty , sexy kind of whisper.
Ill have the tuna.
Excuse me, are you going to be much longer? I have to make a very important call.
"I'll see you."
Hey, Elaine.
I'm a bootlegger.
But, uh, Raymond is a man.
All right. Let's get to work.
Good for you (sympathetic)
It's a blue Honda...
I always look annoyed. Yeah, when you look annoyed all the time, people think that you're busy. Think about it... (acts annoyed for 3 seconds).
I froze. I think I'm losing it.
Trapezoid?
Oh. Sorry.
Not necessarily. Mustard lends itself to the squeeze.
I'm not kidding.
I never assisted in a birth before. Its really quite disgusting.
Well, she probably just assumed.
Here we go.
Ill tell you, if I was running for office I would ask for the death penalty for double-parkers. If this is allowed to go on this is not a society. THIS IS ANARCHY!
You should be the one criticizing me. I, I'm lucky to even know someone like you.
(frustrated) Not necessarily.
What, are you doing me a favor?
Uh-huh. And how much does the healer charge?
How do you know?
No, Ill put half a can of mousse in my head like you.
It was fantastic, Jerry. We wound up talking all night.
You didn't?
I can't.
He fired me.
Heuh. huh. Stick around a while.
Yeah, take care. Stay in touch.
Really, I was, I was only kidding around.
Fine.
I don't understand, how do these thieves start the car?
Could anybody do that?
Hi. Look at how obtrusive this is.
Huh. Excuse me (to Ping) Hum... Do you speak chinese?
This...is an organizer, a secretary, and a friend.
You shook my hand in that coffee shop.
In college, maybe. Those were fun times.
What, you are comparing me to Biff Loman, very encouraging. The biggest loser in history of American literature.
You're right. Why must there always be a problem? You'd think just once I could get a break. God knows I earned it with that score!
Hi, hi, hi, You were wonderful.
That is what I want.
You think she would care about the red dot?
Huge matzoh ball.
Ma, don't cry!
You got bumped from career day?
It was on CNN ( Kramer comes in and he is taping from a Camcorder) This Chinese doctor Zeng Zau. has discovered a cure for baldness.
(smiling expectantly) Here it comes.
Yeah. I did some shopping. Some new clothes shopping. (turns to a man) Can I borrow your menu?
Fourteen. (shouting after Ken) Fourteen!
I don't know.
Maybe I could just use the bathroom.
How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria?
I'm stuck. Pull a little, just a second. Don't start the train! Don't start the train!!
Wait a second, wait. Why are we together?
I told you to stop with the hopping.
Of course it is.
It just didnt work out. What can I do? I wanted to love her. I tried to love her. I couldnt.
You don't like the move?
All right. So, he caught me in a cleavage peek, so big deal. Who wouldn't look at his daughter's cleavage? She's got nice cleavage.
What are you guys doing?
Someday, before I die, mark my words - I'm gonna tell that woman exactly what I think of her. I'll never be able to forgive myself until I do.
Come on, hurry up, old man! I'm an animal!
Over here.
(Interrupting) May I?
No, I would have picked up on it. I can always tell when a woman likes me, they always somehow let you know. With me, they could torture me, I wouldn't tell them. If anything I'd try to make them think I don't like them, then they think, "Oh, look at this guy, he's not even looking at me, he must have something going for him."
What are you doing? You're making more than I am. A secretary cannot make more than her boss.
945
So, I ran into the Rosses again.
Personally I'm a little nervous about going through these things. I'm afraid I'm gonna step through into another dimension.
Uuh, no, no.
Can't find them. That's marvelous. The dance continues.
Oh yeah, when are you gonna execute that plan?
No, it's nothing bad. I'm getting married.
What are all sweatin' for?
Pull hair, Poke eyes, Groin stuff. Whatever I gotta do. (he opens a blue bottled beverage)
It's not real. They're all made up.
So?
YYYDDSSHE(?) ... Jose Jimenez. You recognize it?
What are you doing?...She had those nuts in her mouth, she just spit them out.
Jerry and Elaine saw you.
Oh, don't tell me. Lloyd?
What, was that not politically correct? It's a legitimate question.
So what? What am I supposed to do?
(After looking in the bag) The pea pods? All you saved was the pea pods? (Kramer enters)
Yes, sir. Yes sir, do my best.
Here's the TV. I know you wanted to watch the Super Bowl. Do you at least have some towels we could sit on? It's, like, a four hour game.
Hey, speaking of which, I found a great way to separate the skin from the top of the pudding without leaving any around the edges; Exacto knife.
Well was it a woman?
Not as thin as you think.
Hey, I've eaten frogs, so nobody's perfect. Anyway-
I will not blow this.
What? You dont like this?
I mean he's a good fighter and a nice guy but I don't like him.
All right, we'll be a little late, I,m not taking a cab.
Well where is she?
What?
(grabbing the sweater back) Well it's not really damaged. 85 dollars huh?
(knocking on the counter and feigning a muffled, Chinese voice) Chinese food!
Why? Why? 'Cause he's off his rocker! That's why.
That's right. He just happened to be the previous owner of the vehicle.
He's got Marlon Brando's. I could go to Marlon Brando's house if I really wanted.
Say you, me, and Kramer are, uh, flying over the Andes.
Jerry, Jerry
The government is very touchy about us being in the air. Let us run around on the ground as much as we want. Anything in the air is a big production.
(Vowing) Well, I'll tell you this, though - I am never doing.. that , again.
Oh, please, somebody, stop this!
I have an idea.
(Guessing the look) Stink eye?
Yeah, but get this, the message said 'call me if you have the time'. Heh heh if I have the time, you get it?
(laughs hysterically, gesticulating wildly) This is all blowing up in my face! My serious girlfriend, and my torrid love affair have accidentally crossed paths. I have ruined three lives... (grabbing coat) Well, I understand if you never want to see me again, so... (points towards door)
I'm Cartwright!
She made a big breakfast every Sunday. I don't know what she put in those eggs.
You know, the uh...(mutters it again.)
Hey. I gotta go.
I, I really should go home. Ya.. actually I'm planning on spending the day with my father tomorrow (short laugh) we're uh we're going to a father-son picnic, just the two of us.
You know, .. blah ...
Well it's tough to get a good read but I think if I brought him a chair, he'd sit.
I'm sorry about that lock on the liquor cabinet. The combination musta just flown outta my head. It's a mental block.
The way they make 'em these days, I'll never have to tell her.
So what, they don?t have another plane? She couldn't take a bus?
I was handcuffed to the bed.. In my underwear, (Sighs) where I remained.. (Scene cuts to another story) She was attractive.. She was, also, infact, a Nazi.. (Cuts to another story) The water.. that I had been swiming in was.. very cold. And, when I dropped the towel, there was.. significant shrinkage.. (Scene cuts to, yet, another story) Her parents were looking at me.. So, there I was, with a marble rye hanging from the end of a fishing pole.. (Scene cuts to his closing statements) In closing, these stories have not been embellished, because - they need no embellishment. They are simply, horrifyingly, the story of my life as a short, stocky, slow witted bald man. (Gets up) Thank you. (Every memeber of the board shows some sign that George's story is most deserving of the apartment. Ricardi is crying. George turns to leave, then remembers one more thing..) Oh, also.. my fiance died from licking toxic envelopes that I picked out. (Sobs and loud crying erupts from the board members) Thanks again. (Leaves. Eldridge looks defeated)
All right!
(ecstatic) What? You're moving to Florida!?! That's wonderful! I'm so happy! (pause) For you! I'm so happy for you! Oh, what do you need this cold weather for?
(little subdued) Nakahama Broadcast Corporation.
All right, I'll tell them my sister died. (Starts fake crying) My poor sister died. She was standing and then she was laughing and then they SHOT her! That's the kind of sick city that we're livin' in. They shoot you for laughing. I must go and comfort my poor family. Jerry, take me home so I can comfort my... my poor family.
I'm not getting on a regular plane now - I'm all psyched up to go on a private jet. No way I'm getting on a regular plane.
(hesitates) ...Nooooooooooo...
That's why the world's in the shape it's in.
Allison bought it for me.
You didn't ask him?
Simmer!
Are, are you sure this is decaf? Wheres the orange indicator?
Yeah. No problem.
Strawberry, Cranberry ...
What do you mean "into the patient"?
Warning signs?
Is there something wrong with my parents?
That's right, who the hell are they? How dare they?!
I snapped! It was the last straw. (sighs)
My cars a little crumpled?!?
Blackberry, Boysenberry ...
They say this guy's the best.
Why not?
Yes, please.
Have to give him time on this hour.
Sir, I'm sure it's not a police matter.
(sets down his paper) So how were the eggs?
Me too.
Ridiculous!
How can I do this? How can I move back in with those people? Please, tell me. They're insane. You know that.
Yes I'd like to speak to Marisa Tomei, please? Marisa, Hi it's George Costanza.. I'm the short, funny, quirky bald man you met a little while ago, heh! yeah I was just calling 'cos I wanted you to know that I'm not engaged anymore......well huh, She died....Toxic glue from the wedding invitations.....well we were expecting about two hundred people. Yeah... Anyway.. hum I got the funeral tomorrow but huh.. my weekend is pretty wide open and I was wondering... (dial tone interrupts George)..... Hello...Hello..
How could anybody be so selfish and inconsiderate!
Oh I don't know. Check this out.
If we decide to go at it.
Kramer, what are you doing?
Aww.
Yup.
Of course it's cashemere.
What Consumer? I'm the consumer.
(claps hands triumphantly) We might have an 'it'!
It's not really a mental institution. It's more like a depression clinic. She went out to Woodhaven and checked herself in. I'm, I'm sick over this.
Oh right, right! The blue sweatpants! Gees, it's too bad you can't say anything because of Angela.
No, I froze.
Who?
They can...
Did you talk to him?
...yeah, my wife started getting on me about the lawn today. Im tellin you, its one thing after another.
I bet they're probably doing summersaults about us over there. You think they get butler stories like that everyday? (He calls Susan)
We have to discuss my alibi.
And then in the fifth inning, why did you take off on the pop fly?
The *bank*? This is *found* money. I want to *parlay* it. I wanna make a big score!
Uh, I'm sorry, I can't do this..
Alright, alright! (Goes out onto the sidewalk. The Seinfelds walk by) Seinfelds!
That's David Letterman. I just saw David Letterman walk by. I'll be right back. (He exits)
Do you think it might be possible to add a little shelf like, uh, for an alarm clock?
Oh, my god.
I was just blowin' off a little steam. So what?
Yeah, follow-up question, that'll work.
All my friends do that.
Always.
Kinda busy here.
That's right, you heard me. Get out! You are ruining this whole experience for me!
(disappointment) Oh. Course not.
So call her up and tell her to bring you another one. She'll be delighted to talk to you.
I can't believe I get paid for this.
This is what they would do in the movies! It's a beautiful thing! It's like a movie! I'm gonna slip him a mickey!
(admiring himself in mirror) I did.
No good? All right, uh how about Art... Cor.....
Vandelay!
The thing is...I'm supposed to be T-bone.
Yeah, I got one too.
Well, it would be OK if Darryl was here.
Let me tell you who did, uh, buy it...um we pitched this story to Russell Dalrymple, the president of NBC, and he ate it up with a spoon.
I know. This was the only woman I never lied to. Well thats not entirely true.
Yes. Yes. Care. You know who I think about a lot? Remember SUSAN ? The one that used to work for NBC?
Did she say anything about, uh...
Do you see what this is turning in to? Do I need this. I have to get out of this thing.
What's the difference? You know they way I work. I'm like a commercial jingle. First it's a little irritating, then you hear it a few times, youre hummin it in the shower, by the third date it's (sings) "By Mennen!".
No. That's just electric.
Why do I do anything? tsss...For women.
Yes!
(neither does he) Yeah, well.
Well, I assume there's some sort of write-off.
No, I didn't hear anything.
Hey.
One little wink. She'll freak out, tell my parents. They'll be all over me. Who is this guy?
Oh really. You tell her you shaved it?
Oh Oh, here, lemme uh...
(Holding his drink up to his mouth) Oh my gosh, I just had a great idea. She could come to the party tomorrow and read Gwen's lips for me.
We should take his limo.
(light) No. No, no, no. The cushion was turned over.
I bent over backwards for that woman! Is it that thing I said about her sister?
Of course.
Keep your head down.
I have to talk to Elaine. This cleaing lady is turning the screws on me. She's pushing for this whole relationship thing. She keeps calling me, threatening to go to the boss with this thing, I could lose my job, I gotta do something to keep her quiet.
No. She tried to give me the "it's not you, it's me" routine.
(animated) What're you talking about?! She's very concerned! She said she was gonna get it back.
I like sports. I could do something in sports.
This is not good. World's are colliding! George is getting upset!
All right, dammit, I'm in.
Toasting makes me uncomfortable. But toast, I love. Never start the day without a good piece of toast. In fact, let's toast to toast.
That's it?
Its your decision.
What the hell are you two talking about? (All exit)
(Trying to be modest) Ah, come on..
Well, you know, I shouldn't have let you into Kramer's, now you want to go into Elaine's...she entrusted me with her spare keys, how can I just let you in?
(Still mad a Leslie) Never said goodbye. Goodbye!
Then, I'm at The Foundation...
Wait a minute. I must have been winking down at the office. That's why Mr. Wilhelm was acting so mysteriouso.
Well Dad's been planning this for such a long time, he bought a new blanket, and he got tha...that game with foam paddles and the velcro ball. (laughs)
Hey, so, did you give that radio the old switcheroo?
Wait. Whoa! That's the Rabbi from Elaine's building. I just met this guy the other day.
oh..
Yes, I am.
Alright.
No! I don't! Don't you even care? This is your company! It's your name on the outside of the building! Speaking of which, the 'R' fell off and all it says now is K-uger!
What?
They're breaking up? How do you know?
It's just not good, it's not good.
I have a ten.
You know what? It doesn't matter, because I quit!
Smile
No.
Yeah, drove away.. You know, I said 'Hello' to him. You know, he's - he's-
I can't sell the book. It's been marked.
What clothes?
Still, I bet when they gave him a plane, it was a lot nicer than this one.
Here you go.
No, no, this is supposed to go to Joe Mayo's apartment.
There's no chance of that.
Mom and Pop Seinfeld
Well, at least we know the prosthetic squirrel hips work ... sorry bout the set.
and SUSAN (nod)
This bread has nuts in it!
(on phone, as Jerry gestures beside him) No, Lindsay, I had accidentally spilled coffee on the gentleman's windshield. Why would I do that? I have a job! Well, did she see a squeegee? Well, you're not going to make a dime without a squeegee. That's right, that's right, just tell your mother it was all a big misunderstanding. You won't regret it. Okay, I'll see you later. Buh-bye. (hangs up)
Well Elaine was supposed to help me.
Right. I mean, we're on a subject. Why does it have to be changed?
English. Does anybody speak English .Nobody speaks English.
Ah, no, no. Are you sure? A girlfriend?
Yeah. Never seen anyone so bored. I'm working like a dog here. Give me a moan. *Something*. I'd settle for a belch, for god's sake. All right, come on, let's have it.
That's it?
Where did I get the coffee? Where do think I got the coffee, at the grocery store. (small laugh)
"Plyometric?"
yeah
Would you take her out?
Well, go ahead! Do it!
Yes, yes, she had a nose job. I loved her very deeply. Will she ever speak to me again?
Then, why? Why did you make me drive all the way out here? Why didn't you say something? Why? Why? Why?
Uh, anyway, (Waving bye to everyone) onward and upward.
Well, so much for purification week.
And how does the baldness fit into that plan?
It's Jerry's fault.
I need like a bucket of water! I got a car overheating, I got an alarm that won't go off, I'm pressing 'one', I'm pressing 'two', nothing! What do I do?! Help me! Help me!
People who do that should be arrested.
Thirteen thousand?
(into phone, frantic) Mister Dalrimple! Mister Dalrimple I have to talk to you!
(gasping) I think I swallowed a fly! I swallowed a fly! What do I do? (He turns to a coffee shop patron at the counter.) What can happen?!
hitting phone
Sid, who's gonna move the cars while you're away?
What is it about sex that just disrupts everything? Is it the touching? Is it the nudity?
What if he left you a used Kleenex, what's that, a valentine? Now you go up to him and you tell him that if he's thinking of turning me in, that I got the goods on him!
Oh yeah. My friend lived there.
I really think it looks good.
ahh.....!!
Won't be a problem...(mumbles)
Yesssss.
Elaine.. I have to tell you something...
Oh, my God.
What is with this damn zipper?
All right.
What might that cost?
You should've seen her face. It was the exact same look my father gave me when I told him I wanted to be a ventriloquist.
Why?
I dont know, 120, 130Then they sent some guys to sandblast for 6 hours. Tomorrow they are putting in asbestos.
Yeah.
Oh, the nose job. I don't know, what did you think?
She told you she doesn't like me!
I don't want to hear it, Kramer!
Hes an importer.
That's right. I got his whole car downstairs.
I think I had some hard candy in there.
So? What'm I gonna do?
(hurried) I'll see you.
Oh, don't look. T-This is the part where they change me.
Yeah.
Oh, look, he's going to ask you about my arm. So, just tell him I banged it against a desk. And it's been moving involuntarily ever since.
(Defensively) You can look at them, but do NOT touch them. (Holds them out)
I think I got it. How 'bout this? How 'bout this? We trade Jim Leyritz and Bernie Williams, for Barry Bonds, huh? Whadda ya think? That way I have Griffey and Bonds, in the same outfield! Now you got a team! Ha ha ha.
What? Is that bad?
She asked me to.
They were in here, I saw her put 'em in here!
Okay! Alright!
Listen, listen, dont get worked up, cause youre gonna know the whole story the minute she steps off the plane.
No thanks.
(entering the apartment more fully) Oh. Oh, hi, hi. Hi. Nice to meet you. (peering at the table) What're you having, veal?
I got to get downtown and buy that suit. The store opens in twenty minutes.
You know, I used to love Paris. My uh, dead Fiance, Susan.. (opening wallet) In fact I. think I, I may have a picture of her..
Look, Deena, I know you think I'm crazy, but I'm not. This is just a series of bad coincidences.
How does Tim Whatley even know Newman?
Jerry, I'm gonna kill you!
Of course not. I mean sure, there may have been one or two occasions in the past, when I may have reacted in uh impulsive or somewhat immature manner, but those days are well behind me.
And Ill tell you something else, Im not even going to ask you. I want to know. But Im not gonna ask. Youll tell me when you feel comfortable. So what was it? Four hundred? Five hundred? Did you pay five hundred for this? (Jerry coyly ignores Georges questions, while George grows increasingly serious.) Over six? Cant be seven. Dont tell me you paid seven hundred dollars for this jacket! Did you pay seven hundred dollars for this jacket? Is that what youre saying to me? You are sick! Is that what you paid for this jacket? Over seven hundred? What did you pay for this jacket?! I wont say anything. I wanna know what you paid for this jacket! Oh my God! A thousand dollars?! You paid a thousand dollars for this jacket?! All right, fine. (George heads for the door.) Im walking outta here right now thinking you paid a thousand dollars for this jacket, unless you tell me different. (Jerry remains silent.) Oh, ho! All right! Ill tell you what, if you dont say anything in the next five seconds, Ill know it was over a thousand.
Oh. Really.
Elaine.
No, no she wasn't.
(suspicious) They haven't said anything to you, have they?
And?
I can't go anywhere, I have to wait here for Tatiana's call. Let me just check.
(dials) Hi, are you OK? no, no,.. huh, (hangs up) She hung up.
You had dinner with the Seinfelds'?
Yup. It's really just a question of what kind. Thinking about a bar stool.
Kramer, they like everybody. Theyre friendly people.
Just..go back. Pretend the whole thing never happened.
Elaine, get off the speaker! (Elaine picks up phone)
Im going to find out whats going on. All right?
All right, so what did they do?
(Reflecting on his life gone wrong) This McKigney guy had a few good years.. (To Kramer, bitter) How could you forget to turn off an iron?
I'm not crying. And I shouldn't have said that about your wife. Please accept my apologies.
But why?
Got it.
I didnt know there was a fireplace. A fireplace, that's incredible.
All right. So, you hold out your money, speak your soup in a loud, clear voice, step to the left and receive.
What are you doing here?
The dentist thing?
Well, Jerry, I been thinkin'. I've gotten as far as I can go with George Costanza.
Yeah...
Hey.
Your parents'll never let you do it.
Yeah.
Where's uh, where's Allison..
Oh, no no, I cant go back there. Jerry, its so awkward and, you know, it could be dangerous sexually. Something could happen, Id be right back where I started from.
Ive spent the last hour preparing ten candy bars with no wrappers or identification of any kind for him to select from.
Oh, well...
Ben Cantwell. 85. Huh... You think we'll make it to that age?
No, I can't. She knows I go there. It's not secure. (the call waiting beeps) Hey, I got another call comin' in. I gotta let the machine get it. Bye. (hangs up)
Well... (shuts door) heeere we are (puts down his coat and chuckles)
See?
No not really.
What's gonna happen? They can't kill us.
I thought I saw something fly over here...
No something is bunk and then you debunk it.
Hi (raises his left hand in a slight gesture to say hi)
Can he hear us?
(spotting possible salvation) You know what, I urge you to take it up with him. Go ahead, give him a call, he'll tell you what I'm doing here. (half to himself) Then you can tell me.
Yeah, okay.
uh-uh. What's with the bucket?
What, she's ranking you?
(To Susan) I told you it looked like her..
George Costanza, assistant to the traveling secretary.
O.k....(thinks) I think I know where we can get one.
See, Steinbrenner is like the first guy in, at the crack of dawn. He sees my car, he figures I'm the first guy in
I keep wracking my brain to try and figure out what I did. I was smart, I was funny, I made great small talk with the waitress so she could see I could relate to the commoners, you know, I'm a man of the people.
I cant believe how easy it is. Im virtually Orthodox. All I have to do is read a few books, memorize a few prayers, and Im in the club.
I'm sorry sir.
Oh my god.
(Reading the card from Whatley) "This holiday season a donation has been made in your name to the Children's Alliance."?
I just wanted to talk to him for a minute, but Ill come back.
Hey, Kramer, where are you going?
Some other time.
You don't have to pay for the massage?
Hm. Thanks.
I can't perform under pressure. That's why I never play anything for money, I choke. I could choke tonight. And she works in my office, can you imagine? She goes around telling everyone what happened? Maybe I should cancel, I have a very bad feeling about this.
Oohoho...spicy mustard...woohoho, you're hot tonight!
You think so?
It's over, Jerry. She's gettin' out.
(sighs) She called Susan last night.
Not yet. Oh! Ho ho! God...
I'll bet you, how much?
"BECAUSE IF HE CAN'T JUMP. THERE GOES MY SNEAKER BUSINESS!!"
No...no...no, I hate to tell you this. Youre not gonna see this woman.
(happily) Difficult?
I think I'd be good at that. I talk to people all the time. Someone even told me once they thought I'd be a good talk show host.
You wanted to see me, Mr. Steinbrenner?
All right, it wouldn't kill me.
Yeah, you know, what'd she uh, look like?
Do you think it would be better if I did?
Yes, good to see you, too. And Good luck with, uh... with the whole thing, there.
Lets not forget the radiator. The steam has been on here for ten years. No human can turn this off.
That's a very good question. You know she and I go out for dinner, she doesn't even reach for the check. That?s all I?m asking for is a reach. Is that so much to ask for?
This is a crude mock-up of the conference room. 1/14th scale.
What?
Yes sir!
Alright, start looking for spaces.
I can't come out. They're standing right by the door. Throw it up!
Why d'you think I'm going now?
I mean, we're not stupid, right? We know when something's funny!
June. Juune, baby!
Uh, nothing, lets get going. Come on. (laughs) hu hu.
Moops!
How about Bozo?
I've been to a few of em. If you uh start to get woozy later, which is quite common, stay close to me. I'll get you through it. (chuckles)
I can't, Steinbrenner might still be there!
Oh, it had to happen!!
Oh-ohf (snorts) yeah, I'm a writer. (laughs)
She can't take it. It's not hers, it's theirs. Once there's no theirs there's no hers, it should be ours.
Yea they're making Paella.
Why didn't anything happen between you two?
(Munching on a hamburger) This Arbys is good.
What if it rains?
So, what are you saying?
What's he going to do? That's exactly the point. Nobody knows what this guy is capable of! He fires people like it is a bodily function.
Never happened.
(To the store owner) Excuse me, what do you think of these?
I think that's a good sign.
(Muttering, slow) Hang on, Ma.. hang on..
(seeing his parents being intimate) Oh, my god!
Wha... you're going?
I don't know.
Yeah, yeah. I see the irony. All right. What about this? What if I can find some way to break up with her so that she'll still like me and it doesn't affect the deal.
You never had sex in the office before?
Your lawyer wears a cape...?
A billiard parlor?
I have never seen a Mohel like that.
God bless you.
Say it's Saturday night in Spain. They go out dancing. You think they do the flamenco?
Why do I get pesto? Why do I think I'll like it? I keep trying to like it, like I have to like it.
Woah, back it up, back it up. Beep, beep, beep. Tractor story?
rush? you want a rush? drop a ball on your toe my friend, talk about a rush, you'll be throbbing, you'll see visions
(somewhat annoyed) I suppose you could be an architect.
How much are we gonna get for this? Fifty, sixty thousand?
Good.
I'll try a piece.
April.
Boy, I wish the flamenco was popular here.
Ah, see, Mister.. I didn't write that report. That, that's not mine.
No, not at all...
Oh, I had no choice. She squeezed it out of me! Shed tell me she loved me. All right, at first, I just look at her. Id go, Oh, really? Or uh, Boy, thats, thats something. But, eventually you have to come back with, Well, I love you. You know, you can only hold out for so long.
(Sarcastic) Yeah, performance artist. She's a real performer. A real trooper.
You know, you have to know how to do that. You cant have people shoving their arms into a six-hundred degree oven!
No, and you weren't funny last night either. In fact, you got us both so depressed, she asked me to drive her home after dinner.
Stinks.
Well, I think this is it.
I'll tell ya, if I had one of these things, I'd be eatin' hot dogs all the time.
I saw "Titanic". So that old woman, she's just a liar, right?
You know I still don't know how you can call lunch with me a business expense.
(Losing it) Don't tell me how to eat!
What, you think I'm going to repeat the whole thing now?
Yo.
Did you just say vault?
That's uh, KL5-8383. Are you calling them soon because, they keep very strange hours.
Uh, it's only a matter of time.
What happened to your voice?
Forget it? I already called my parents. I told them to expect the surprise of a lifetime. My mothers making her roasted potatoes!
Rest... Sest... Hest...
I gotta call Tatiana. where's the phone?
Is that Elaine?
What are you doing here? I thought you said you hated Isabella's?
What?
(signs) Sorry. (expectant) You're sure, uh, there isn't anything else?
She's right, I heard Kramer got mugged out on the suburbs on a baby-sitting gig.
Oh, I think that's fantastic. Good for you. Nice. That's very nice.
I could go bumper to bumper with any one else on this planet!
All right.........I've become attracted to Elaine..
Right, gotta get going.
No, no. I-I just want us to be... together.
Not bills.
(Showing an example) What'd you do today?
No, I know I don't have to, I want to.
(Panicky) Uh, yeah. You know, Doctor, I gotta tell you, I feel a lot better.
Slippery Pete?
Where's the depravity?
It's not working, Jerry. It's just not working. (sits down next to Elaine)
George, how you doing?
He stole your girlfriend?
Who's he?
There you go, okay? That's my *other* friend's ticket. You happy now? You got two tickets.
I should be in a place like this. I envy this woman. Ya' get to wear slippers all day. Friends visit. They pity you. Pity is very underrated. I like it it's good. Plus they give you those word association tests. I love those.
Yeah, right.
Wyck.
Yup, y'know, they really spruce up the apartment.
These fries are really really good...
Oh, I'm goin' baby. I'm goin.' (Heads for the door, then stops.) It's Jerry's fault. He took out all my good lines. He's such a control freak!
How much?
One... (Glenda seeing George is serious; gets up and leaves)
Oh, thank you.
What are they saying now?
You bought non-refundable tickets, you idiot!
Plenty of mosquitoes.
No. That's disgusting!
You can't tell him the truth, you're gonna blow the whole thing.
I figured you'd cruise. At least through the Spring.
Conveyor belt.
I mentioned how I liked horse manure.
Hi. (waves to Donald and laughs) hahahaha.
Im outta the picture. I am outta the picture. (laughs) Its only a matter of time now.
Yeah, it's me, I just got home.
..Okay.
(acting disappointed) Oh, please don't.
Ttu (wipes nose and sniffs) Ttu.
That's a shame. (Karen is shown singing off-key on the television.)
Oh, well I didn't know you went into Queens Jerry.
C'mon Jerry, let's go. What was that all about?
Morning Thunder has caffeine in it, Jerry doesn't drink caffeine.
Fragile Frankie Merman? I never liked that guy.
Well perhaps, not to the extent that you are. But I know the basic plot. Yeah.
No no no, no mistake, no mistake. No, no , listen, we're going to get married over Christmas, I It doesn't make any difference to me. It's fine. Really.
You haven't even seen one.
No, that's not it at all.
Take it off. You're going to ruin it.
Will you shut up?!
That's insulting! Ted Danson makes eight hundred thousand dollars an episode.
It was more like a full bodied dry heave set to music.
Ow! What are you doing under there? Hey, stop that! Don't eat that! That's not food! (to Robin) He's suckin' down Equal packets!
Hey, hey.
This is very hard to follow with all the talking.
I once told a woman that I really enjoy spending time with my family.
Yeah, coy.
This isn't going well.
So what's the deal they don't want to have dinner with my parents?
Elaine you don't understand. I had 103 temperature when I bought that sweater. I was so dizzy I was seeing red dots everywhere. I thought everything in the store had a red dot on it. I couldn't distinguish one red dot from another. I couldn't afford anything. I have nothing. I haven't worked for a really long time. (Jerry is standing right behind George. Jerry takes out a hankerchief and starts fake-crying in it.) I mean look, I have no clothes, look at what I'm wearing. It's just a little red dot.
You gotta give us odds. At least two to one - you gotta put up two-hundred dollars.
As you care for me. Which is why it is very important that you never breathe a word of this to anyone about the... you know. What, with Clarence Thomas and everything.
Wa, uh, thank you sir, you know I am not quite sure I'm right for it.
Oh. Oh. Yeah, sure. Here. Uh, sit down. Uh, uh, cheese, there? (he grabs a suit jacket from the desk chair and puts it on)
Yeah, okey, wait wait. That will separate.
Where does he come off?
Just give it a little more time.
You heard him.
Yes!
Oh, it's locked?
Well she apologized, and then she wanted to know if we could get together Wednesday afternoon.
I like herbal tea.
Good afternoon. One large crab bisque to go. Bread. Beautiful.
Nah.
(hesitant) Uh, Mr Wilhelm. Uh, about the project...
Makes the 11 gauge look like a cap pistol.
(excited) Did I tell you that story's relatable?! That was a great show! That is why I'm bringing it back to NBC.
I don't know, she lives right around the corner. You could take it here or go to the coffee shop.
Uh, le - let's go do, something.
I'll call a plumber right now! (Goes for the phone.)
What the hell happened to your shirt?
Jerry, you came for the big moment.
I can't believe, you're blaming Lupe?
Get outta here..
I cheated in the contest.
In six games.
Going to need a little more coffee here.
It's complicated.
Yes faddah.
Oh!, so what. I'd rather she hate me and thought I was good looking....At least I can get somebody else. (scratching his chest) What is this? Why am I itching?
You know Elaine, I'd do it but I'm working that day.
What did you do here? You took out the wrong guy.
(claps all happy) AH! (half hugs Estelle)
How hard could it be? You make a little contribution, you have a ceremony. I am going to think about this. I am really going to think about this.
A drafty apartment? A... sweaterless friend? A ball-game giveaway Metlife windbreaker?
Anyway, so he gave me his spare keys, now he wants to have my keys, so I need mine back from you.
Twenty-five percent? It was your idea.
I'm starving. We should have had lunch first..
So is it all over between you and... Marsha Mason?
I've got some plans. I got plans.
I heard your whole conversation.
You see I disagree. I'd rather be dating the blind. You know you could let the house go. You could let yourself go. A good looking blind woman doesn't even know you're not good enough for her.
What? Oh I spilled some food on it.
Oh well, gracias El Commandante, gracias. Muy muy.
There's something I have to tell you.
I dont know. Just start scratching. Tell him you have the crabs. He was in the military. Hell understand that.
Nobody's hiring now. The market's terrible.
No, she's taking this course in education for her masters. It's part of her research project, so I have to be a guinea pig.
(from other room) Uh, tippy toe! Tippy toe! Lemon tree!
I eh, I had a sandwich in my pocket.
All right, Kramer that's it.....( pushes the camera) Hello . English. Does anyone speak English
Cosmo
Just inch over. You worm your way.
Oh, wow.
Two tickets to "Guys And Dolls"! I'm gonna go with you!
Well, I didn't really think about what I was gonna do with all..
(pauses to consider this then gives in) All right. (starts heading towards bedroom)
Interesting.
I'm sorry, Jerry I can't help you.
I don't know, maybe a safe fell on her head.
[whispering] Elaine? [loud whisper] Elaine! [louder whisper] Elaine!
Man, I'm starving.
No, what is it?
Well, wha-what about the toe? What happened to the toe?
OH!!!! What are you, crazy?! Are you, crazy?!
So?
So, Marcy, you should've seen me in the hot tub yoday.
Here we go, LA.
She's too tanned. It's the middle of the winter, she's like a carrot.
I thought Mulva hated you.
Well, uhm, I think I'd like to do it.
Hey, check this out. I gotta give out Christmas presents to everyone down at Kruger, so I'm pulling a Whatley. (Give a Christmas card to Jerry)
And... and anybody can do this?
Because my cousin's imbecile dog was rolling around outside and they got in his carpet.
You know what word Susan used last night? Hnuh. Vault! hu,
well I don't know if there's gonna be any place to eat up there
(surprise) What? I..I didn't hear about that.
Oh ya, like there's something wrong with saying 'God bless you'. I was raised to say 'God bless you'.
Almost. Couldn't get the girl go out with me the second time.
They are?
It's cleavage. I couldn't look away. What am I, waiting to win an Oscar here? This is all I have in my life.
I forgot to ask you; how did the revenge date go?
That doesn't explain the lipstick on the dashboard?
Hey, go.
It's a talent I have.
Well all right, beautiful, so you stop in. Ya, ya visit the bubble boy for twenty minutes and then we can go.
Where's the sunblock?
Whyie?
You don't understand, there's a *blurb* about me in this magazine!
What?
Hey hey.
Oh, I think it is! I think that's exactly what it is!
Mom? Dad?
(gleeful, to Estelle) You did?! That's Goood! That's very good! I'm very glad to hear that.
How would I know?
Mark, is this true?
It's like some pod landed from another planet and took your body. Don't fall asleep Elaine.
Yeah, you're right, you're right. (To Elaine) Alright, maybe he's not interested, but you still know him - can't you just ask him?
Do you wanna talk about hotels, or do you wanna win some ball games?
Hey, don't embarrass me today. I got some friends in the stands. (George makes a swinging motion with an imaginary bat and pulls something in his back.)
Oh ah, I uh, will have that for you by after lunch.
I'd like to rent Breakfast At Tiffany's.
Oh yeah, real cool. You're a cool guy.
Oh with all due respect, I went there too, and I work for a team that just won the World Series.
A cup of coffee. That, that doesn't mean anything.
(Somewhat stern) Oh, the thing's cancelled. Sit down.
We'd have to kill him.
It happens.
What, you know Jerry?
Except for one small problem. Hah, I left some books in her apartment.
I zipped up!
Definitely.
Well, I guess I'm getting older.
Oh, sure. I mean, after all, you were almost my, uh... OK, I gotta go.
Hey, now you're onto something.
So?
No, it isn't.
(Annoyed) Yeah, yeah. We'll, uh, let you know.
He purposely mispronounced my name. Instead of saying, "Costanza" He'd say, "Can't stand ja". "Can't stand ja" ... He made me smell my own gym socks once.
Give me the phone!
When I asked him if it was cancer, he didn't give me a "get outta here". That's what I wanted to hear "Cancer? Get outta here?"
"No I didn't"
Well uh....
Nah. It's all right. Great! She had a good time.
. We should be having dinner with our sons when we're sixty.
Come on, lets not stand here too long, we might run in to her.
Jerry, I'm not suggesting getting rid of the girl. She's integral.
You are a genius, it's as simple as that.
Can I say one word to you? Lobster. The lobster here is unbelievable. (looks at the menu) Ooh, a little expensive.
(pointedly to Elaine) Oh. Thanks very much for yesterday, by the way.
Is that it?
Wed all go to movie on Friday?
How gee what a coincidence.
No, no. Hes just being modest.
Alright, let's see, let's see. What else. What else. Oh yeah, what does she do?
I am not giving you my code.
That was a hell of a thing when Spock died...
Jerry, its not my fault.
What do you mean?
No, you can have it.
Alright! Please, please! I cannot have this constant bickering!.. Stress is very damaging to the epidermis! Now, I have an important photo session in the morning - my hands have got to be in tip-top shape, so please - keep the television down, and the conversation to a minimum.
No, no no. That skips a generation. The baldness gene comes from your grandfather.
It's like I'm Neil Armstrong. I turn around for a sip of Tang and you jump out first.
What does the chaperone do?
Nah, nah, it's uh, it's a long story. Just uh, try to get it up.
Well, maybe they're done with it. I could go pick it up.
Well, it wouldn't fit you. The sleeves are too short.
Why don't you ever go shopping?
(leaving to the bedroom) I gave it to Cosmo.
See, didn't bother Susan either. That's why I'm different. I can sense the slightest human suffering.
Ah! Health's not good enough. I want more than health. Health's not doing it for me anymore. I'm sick of health.
(frustrated) Take it easy! Huh! Take it easy!
You're soured?
I'll get him to see a real doctor. You just stay away from this.
Oh, here we go...
Yeah, that's what I want-- triangles. Alright, I'm outta here. Have fun with what's-her-name.
Rid? Nah, c'mon, the word is 'care'. Care. I care about your comfort, be it here in Queens or twelve-hundred miles away.
What about a letter?
Wait a second. 'Little places to go, where they never close.' What's a little place that never closes?
It says very clearly, 'for your protection, do not give your secret code to anyone.'
Perhaps. (hehe) I walk in, everything is organized -- messages, appointments. And I can't tell you how proud I am of myself for going with Ade.
Jerry, it's fantastic. I love the people over there. They- they treat me so great. You know they think I'm handicapped, they gave me this incredible office, a great view.
Babs left?
Let's go, people, let's go! It's Prognosis Negative time, wa ha ha ha!!!
Maybe he was going to say "Of course I have to check with my associates."
(smiling) Uh, hi. Uhm, remember me? I..I'm the guy who looks like Neil?
So all right I'll speak to you through Jerry and everything.
Well, a lot of people keep popcorn in the house.
(to Jerry) Yeah, your milk.
What is that? B.O.?
It's a pot pourri. May I, uh, may I show you the master bedroom? (they leave together)
I know.
Lena, how'd you meet her?
I can't just leave.
Why am I a marine biologist?
Okay, I guess I'll see you down there.
I dont want to get out of it.
Oh, thank you.
A... ah...
I gotta try and find a way to switch places with him. It's like a Sigfried and Roy trick.
What do you mean you didn't think I wasn't gonna use them?!
So you're against me now?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Get out of here. I didn't see any cameras there.
Hey!
Took a shot.
No.
Where is she?
I can't believe it. Look, that's Jerry Seinfeld.
All right we got the wine. Aren't we lucky? We got wine. Whoopee Whoa! Imagine if we didn't bring the wine. We'd be shunned by society. Outcasts! WHERE'S YOUR WINE? GET OUT!
(To Jerry) We got work to do. What about the meeting?
Yeah, yeah. He went into the bedroom and started sobbing.
Kramer, this is perfect. I need you to go in there, pretend you're a doctor and check this guy for moles.
Reprogram all the buttons, see if he changes them back. You know? The old switcheroo.
It seemed so disorganized.
Its an incredible deal. I dont know why you dont come with me.
(cont'd) she says, We have to talk.
(shouts) Wait! Yes! That's what I should've said! (frustration) D'ohh!
Because, I've got the coat. I can sit in the car and not get cold.
Is that common in our family?
What are you talking about? How can you sit there and look me in the eye and tell that me you're not worried?! Don't you have any *sense*?!! Don't you have a brain!? Are you so completely senile that you don't know what you're talkin about Anymore!!?!
Now my parents are gonna know I had people over.
You
No. I like the ball! This is my One Chance to make a Great Entrance! My whole life! I have never made a great entrance!
Why does it always seem like I'm the only one working at this break-up?
I think Im getting tired of it. I mean is that all it does? Hello? La-la-la?
How's the trip?
(talking to nobody) Nah. It's probably a union thing.
(uncomfortablly) Thank you.
(cocky laughter) Huh haha! (shouts) You're meat, Reilly! You just screwed yourself! (laughter) Ha ha!
A plane crash? A Heart attack? Lupus? Is it Lupus?
Rick.
And God didn't kill me.
(Disappointed) A frog?
It's baffling, isn't it?
Well...
Yeah. See ya.
So, let me ask you. Do you think I could have done this?
All right Superman's the exception.
If this lip reading thing works tonight do you know how incredible this is going to be? It's like having Superman for your friend.
Is this the ticket holders line, or the buyers?
A woman that hates me this much comes along once in a lifetime.
So, were talking, and I dont like to go too long before I ask them out, I wanna get it over with right away, so I just blurt out, What are you doing Saturday night?
Thats it! Thats it! I cant take it. I cant take it anymore! You stole the statue! Youre a theif! Youre a liar!
So this Anna called me from out of the blue.
You know, about the uh, two of us getting together. And I know that I said I was engaged, but (laughs) uh, you know, it's really just something you say. It's like, going steady. You know uh, going steady, engaged, it's, it's all just stuff you say. (chuckles) Anyway, I was watching uh, My Cousin Vinnie, on the uh, on the tape the other day, and I was thinking that uh, you know, the two of us might take a meeting, as they say. (chuckles) So, what d'you, what d'you think?
Him who? Hayman him.
Yeah.
Because I cant call a woman with other people in the room. Come on, lets go.
My father wears his sneakers in the pool! Sneakers!
He knows I'm waiting. He sees me. He just doesn't wanna look.
Really...(he honks the car and is startled, Elaine laughs)......I have to say...You were really good doing that porno thing....you're talented.
Where are you goin'..
Oh well, I hope he doesn't jum...
...he embibed her glistening spell...just before the other shoe...fell.
Cmon, go for twenty-five hundred. Well do it together. Come on, come on. Were in it together.
What?
What?
(he thinks a little about it... and as he puts his hand on his knee and gets up) I'm sorry Karen. I know I care for you, but I just can't stand when someone doesn't like me. (he opens the door)
(Like a kid) Because I don't want to.
(forced buoyancy) Hey, you know, let's call Susan, we'll go have coffee.
My face! My face! Get me to the hospital!
All right. So let me ask you a question. Who was the man in the cape?
What?
Oh! Here you are. Ha ha...You, uh, you want to--
Right. I don't have it on me. Allison, this is Susan. Susan, Allison.
I have plants. (snorts)
C'mon Jerry, please! It won't happen again.
Good Morning!
Well, I'm sure you'll find something.
Yeah. see you later.
Thanks, Warden.
What'd I say? Clara?
So you're telling me instead of them being happy to see me, they're going to be upset because I didn't bring anything. Ttst --You see what I'm saying?
Anyway, as I was lying in the puddle, I-I think I may have found a way for us to get Bonds and Griffey, and we wouldn't have to give up that much.
You know, the time..
Well that makes sense.
(he drops a paper airplane he was holding) Mr. Wilhelm!
What are you crazy?
. . . naw, it's just you thanked HER, and and oh, . . . what's the difference?
(PULLING OUT ESTIMATE OUT OF HIS POCKET) Well, profit. I think you'll see from the estimate that I'm not really profiting that much. They might be a little high, but..
You're Batman.
How come you don't know what street are you on?
My name is George. I'm unemployed and I live with my parents.
You don't believe me? Ask Jerry.
I am an art-adorer! I adore art.
(resigned) Dammit.
I'll give you a quarter.
You know the anxiety you feel on a date? That's what I have every day now. My worst nightmare's come true, every day is a date.
Why not? Why not?
Nothing. It's not YOU..
(to phone) Hi, Allison? Oh, I guess you're not at home.. I probably should 'ave tried you at the office. Anyway, good to hear from ya, really looking forward to the ball.. (hangs up and happily chuckles) Ha ha!
What do think I tell Jerry everything? It's not like he's my wife.
You know. (All three give him blank stares) I was alone..
How did he do that?
So Anyway, I started to compliment Elaine on her sketches and it turns out,they're Paula's.
I mean, uh... I had fun ice skating.
You owe me ten dollars.
Excuse me, uh, what are you doing in there?
Why not?
Jerry, unless I pull down on this statuette and a hidden wall opens up, we have checked every square inch of this apartment!
She's not faking!
I happen to dress based on mood.
Hey, Mr Lazzari.
Ah... (quietly)
How would you find out something like that...wait a minute, what am I thinking? I've got the entire Yankee organization at my disposal.
Did she say Hello?
He sold me ladies' glasses!
That's exactly what I'm trying to avoid!
Yeah? Well, I had sex with your wife.
Well today's your lucky day.
Dad, what's all this?
She supports her whole family. (walking slowly into the room)
With Candace Bergen!
No! No!!
Exactly..
"Off the wagon"?
I could be a character.
What? Now, you listen to me!
Susan, wait please... (grabs her) Please ...
Do you realize in the entire history of western civilization no one has successfully accomplished the Roommate Switch? In the Middle Ages you could get locked up for even suggesting it!
Dead?
Well, I'm sorry, Timmy...but I don't dip that way. (takes a chip.)
No kidding?
He just walked away! And once again I'm standing here like a little man. Well not this time! (George leaves the store and follows the dog owner) You! Dog man!
No.
Because they were heated up there.
She's ahem....gone
Okay.
Reparations!
Hid? I have no idea how this suit got misplaced. Nevertheless, I do believe I shall purchase it.
Excuse me. Is this, uh, Rage-aholics?
Boy, that was awkward!
What did they put on this tuna? Tastes like a dill, I think it's a dill.
Mr. Pensky? Of the Pensky file?
I'm telling you, that cashier is riding horses on my money.
Yeah. I am like a drug dealer. I got the guy hooked. I am having lunch at his desk everyday this week. He doesn't make a move without me. It's very exciting.
I was jumping over a puddle, and for some reason I went like this. (George stretches out his arms in a ballet motion) And they called me a Mary. So I chased them, and I tripped and I fell.
Where do you come up with this stuff?
I told her I was out o' soda, I went out to get some, an' I never went back.
No, stings the throat. Anyway, so I was coming along here, and I felt like a piece of cake, you know? But then I thought, it's morning, I should really have a muffin. I like those chocolate chip ones. Then I figured, well, they're really both cake. So I, uh, I sat on that bench for a little while, twenty minutes or an hour, and then I figured, check and see what you were up to. (a thought occurs to him) Wait a minute, wait a minute. The broad jump! The broad jump over the pothole on Eighty-sixth Street!
Sorry. Thank you.
Now Im in the worst position of all.
What?
She didn't like me?
What are you doing? Where do you think you're going?
(still by the door) What? M-Maura, what are you doin' here? I ended this relationship... twice!
(panicky) What are you gonna do? Are you gonna call the police?
There it is. Gate 46... We got plenty of time.
Honesty, hard-work, these are the values that I was raised on. The most important thing Joey, is to be able to look yourself in the mirror before you go to sleep at night.
Ohh, hey there, young fella. (They shake hands) What's your major?
Wha?
Wait a second, where are you going?
(Interrupting) Anyway, I just wanted to let you know I'm really sorry that happened, and if I can help out in any way, I'll certainly be glad to do that. (Pause) Well, I guess that's about it.
I saw Amy making out with your cousin Jeffrey.
(shocked and angry) You paid that crook?!
Lobster.
Because I promised her.
Poor kid.
No, anything.
Signal? What signal?
Uh, excuse me. (stopping them from rehearsing) Excuse me. (he walks to the guy's in charge of yelling "take #!") This--This is not right. May I? (the guy looks at George with a bothered face. George then walks up to Tom and takes him away from Jerry and Michael to talk to him in private)(to Tom) You see, you're going "They fooled *me* Jerry!" (George shakes his head with disapproval) You wanna hit 'fooled' more "They *fooled* me Jerry!". You see the difference?
Just the last few innings of a double-header.
I still have it. The collar's okay. I wear it under sweaters.
I believe strongly in that as you know.
I was in there for two minutes. He didnt do anything. Touch this, feel that  seventy-five bucks!
Hey, I'm sorry, you had your buffer zone for many years. It's my turn to live, baby.
Well, we would like to be in business. Let's do business. We'll have some business. Let's have business.
Well, I'm here. What is it?
Out of the question.
This guy sounds just like me.
Hehehehehe (higher tone laugh, though still quietly )
They said tomorrow, maybe.
That's my vow to you.
It's in the vault?
The death certificate?
Wow
I don't know.
Or something. I said, Or Something!
This is not about them. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to exercise Jerry's gaskets.
Love to.
(upset) Well, you've scared her off. We may never see mom again.
(Expressing shock) Woah. Whoa! Woah!
Uh, no, I'm not.
Phew!
(Stern, angered) I hope so. (Takes the scissors)
What are they doin' lettin' you bastards on an airplane? Don't they know that's against FAA regulation?
Well, they're obviously not here.
That's exactly what I said, except I used the word "momentum".
Yeah. (clears his throat) We should do this again.
I'm uh... writing a pilot for NBC...
"Ha..harrr."
The Duty Free Shop? Duty Free is the biggest sucker deal in retail. Do you know how much duty is?
You mean just going there because I'm invited, that's rude?
I was supposed to see her. She wasn't supposed to see me.
First class doesn't make it anymore. Now you get on the phone with Kimbrough, tell him what happened and tell him to get another plane down here, but this time, the good one - the Ted Danson plane.
Yes. The New Yorker.
That's right. It's just me and her.
Eh, there's that woman that never talks to anybody.
That's right...We just had sex......You know Jerry I've been searching for someone a long time. Well the search is over.
Gary? Well, well, well well. Where the hell've you been? I've been leaving you phone messages for months.
We'll just take a check. (She leaves the check. George, in all his cheapness, can't help but to review the check. He finds an error) You made a mistake on the..
try shaking it...(long pause) Well,Janet should be here any minute.
No, no, no we'll talk about it later.
Unless she goes for the bathroom. Thats my only chance. (George crumbles. He drops the cassette on the table.) Who am I kidding? I cant do this, I cant do this. I dont even know how to work those stupid machines.
Jerry, I'm trapped under my desk. Steinbrenner is in the room. You got to help[ me.
How do I get the hand?
What's desert?
She seems like an it.
Yeah, so what? I'm not the only one! (Kramer enters with his quilt.)
Right, can we go? Cause Im double-parked, Im gonna get a ticket.
Well, this is the Jerry Seinfeld that only I know. I can't believe I just told you that.
But, but I'm disturbed! I'm depressed! I'm inadequate! I got it all!!
That is so funny!
Thinking? Nothing. What could I possibly be thinking?
(worked up) I'm aware! I'm aware!! But this is Marisa Tomei, Elaine. An Oscar winner! How can I live the rest of my life, knowing I coulda been with Marisa Tomei? She said I was just her type! She loves short, stocky, balding funny men!
I wouldn't mind seein' <that>.
I'm writin' it. "How's it going?"
Actually I think I'm gonna take a few days off (starts to leave)
...neither am I.
Yes, oh yes very much.
You don't need the cufflinks! You have the same name! (no reaction) 'Jerry'! (heads for door, grabbing his coat)
Of course.
No! I am not going to see a psychiatrist!
Why?
Ya, ya. I bumped into him on the bus. What did he have to say?
(Makes a gesture saying he understands. The man nods) But how.. uh..?
Oh, well, I'm sure you can reach her...she's a poet. What does a poet need an unlisted number for?
(Definite) Oh yeah.
The truth. you want the truth? It is your earrings It is the chopsticks but it's so much more. You're pretentious. You call everyone by their full name You call my doorman, Sammy, "Samuel" but you didn't even say "Samuel" You went "Sam - U- EL" Papie-eh Mach-eh What is Papie-ay Mach-ay?
Well then, from out of nowhere, a huge tidal wave lifted me, tossed like a cork and I found myself right on top of him, (ELAINE gasps quietly Ahhhh) face to face with the blow-hole. I-I, I could barely see from the waves crashing down upon me but, I knew something was there so I reached my hand in, felt around and pulled out the obstruction!
I'm not really sure, I...
You want your blankets tucked in?
Snoopy and Prickly Pete. Should I keep driving?
Why don't we talk about it another time.
Champagne?
You got bit by a strange dog and you didn't get a rabies shot?
Oh my god, maybe Gwen saw it. Maybe that's what did it.
...Why?
Why'd you pick Hoover? Was he that interesting to talk to?
Of course. But I really wanna leave my mark this time, you know, uh. I wanna walk away from the Yankees with people saying 'Wow! Now that guy got canned!'
Screw the Drake!
..And I went down there one time to see...
Would you believe my luck? The first time in my life I have a good answer to the question, "What do you do?" and I have a girlfriend. I mean, you don't need a girlfriend when you can answer that question. That's what you say in order to get girlfriends. Once you can get a girlfriend, you don't want a girlfriend, you just want more girlfriends.
Wow. Uh, what do I have to do?
Might meet a celebrity.
What's it gonna be?
Wo-hoah! What did you do?
You see this is the thing. . . . (crying) I just feel . . . mumble, cry, mumble, . . . I'm scared. You and I together, (cry)
Really?
Excuse me.
Yes, you have to be Murphy.
I-I'm already here. I'm here. I'm here. Uh, you know what? If you want a computer, call me. I-I gotta go.
Didn't say anything. (They go into Elaine's apartment.)
Nah, it's not a good turn. December. December. Don't you think we should have a little more time just to get to know each other a little.
I love these people, you can't ask 'em questions. (getting excited) They're so mentally gifted that we mustn't disturb the delicate genius unless it's in the confines of an office. (worked up) When huge sums of money are involved, then the delicate genius can be disturbed!
S'cuse me ..Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?
The show is about nothing.
Isn't polite to say Hello when somebody says hello?
Daphne. I have to tell you something, this is very difficult...
This good be so sweet, Jerry. Saving lives? She's one step away working at the clinique counter!
Cut it.
(curious) Bald? Uh?
Of course hes been in touch with him. Hes left two messages. He just hasnt heard back yet, thats all.
Hey look a that - boy are you lucky - another great spot - right in front of the hospital. In an emergency yet! How lucky are you huh? Is that unbelievable? How unbelievable is that huh? Come on, give it to me, give it to me.
Okay, go ahead. Call her, get married, have babies, have a great life.. What do I care? I'm finished. (Really depressed) It's all over for me. In fact, let's end it right now. Jerry, kill me, kill me now. I'm begging you. Let's just get it over with. Be a pal.. Just take the pillow and put it over my face.
Elaine! (shouts) ELAINE!!
Fine, I'll buy a pack of gum.
The parakeet in the mirror. That's a good one, Stu.
Soooooo
Yeah! Look at me! I was free and clear! I was living the dream! I was stripped to the waist, eating a block of cheese the size of a car battery!
(Frantic) Kramer, do you know what those guys are gonna do to me?!
(doing the voice) Not at all.
Where are you living? Are you here? Are you on this planet? It's impossible. It can't be done.
Yeah.
All right, I'll ask her.
(muttering to himself) I wonder why.
(looking at his watch) I really should get going. Y'know, I..I wanna be home in case Neil calls.
Fifteen seconds.
I think you're right. You gonna eat that?
Then I got off the phone right away.
Oh, cmon, Jerry. I cant believe this.
Too good...
(explaining, with lots of hand gestures) Okay, look. We've never worked together on a lie. Now, you don't understand how I work. I have a certain way of working. Jerry and I have worked together a few times. He knows how I work. It's not a personal thing, y'know? We're just trying to come up with the best possible lie. That's what this is all about.
Well, Tony.. took a bit of a tumble
Holes! I need holes!
Well, I didn't really tell Susan about it, and she doesn't really have anything else to do.
No, no, I mean, driving Susan to lesbianism.
It better be.
She didn't help him?
Hey.
Yeah, I told her to call me here and to tell anyone who answers the phone to ask for a balding, stocky man with glasses. I better tell him I'm expecting a call.
(to the cashier) Excuse me, I gave you a twenty dollar bill and you only actually gave me change for a ten.
What are we supposed to do? What do you do on a situation like this? Should we call a lawyer, should we call the police?
Because, if you ever see her and it comes up, we have to be in sync. Hmm?
".....Well. I'm sorry. Call you right back."
Is there a meal allowance? What about seat assignments? Could I have the Kosher meal? I hear the Kosher meal is good. And I need clothes. Gotta get a haircut. Gonna have to, I have to refill my allergy medication. Oh, do I need a hat? I need a hat, don't I? Could we do the Universal tour? They have that Backdraft exhibit now, that looks very cool to me...
(Unsure) I don't a..
Why not?
He he This guy really gets around.
I got it. Cups in the front, loops in the back. (puts the bra on the table)
Marisa Tomei! I, just spoke to Marisa Tomei! (sitting opposite Elaine) And I wasn't even that nervous.
My hand is out.
She didn't want to come, she-she's not really into sports.
(Laughs nervously) ..Ulterior motive.
What hat?
Absolutely, uh, lets see there's, uh, Vandelay Industries, I just saw them. I got very close there. very close.
Well, he has to play! He can't just not play. We're playing! Look, I gotta see him, how do I get in touch with him?
Uh, no. No, we shouldn't.
Let's do it.
(Confused) Flagged?
(Extremely blunt) Burned.
Twix.. (Makes various noises) B-5.
Im not going with him. I dont even know the guy. (to the teller) Look, they did this for me before.
Bania?
All right, let's--let's focus. Can we get back to the plan?
Can I come upstairs, please? (Elaine pushes the button and lets George in.)
I can't believe you're not playing in cotton.
What?! Well, what are you doing here?
Because of the day before. It's a long story.
China.
Me?
Did you ever go to a singles weekend in the Poconos?
. All right , just give me my car and let me get the hell out of here.
Oh well, that's, uh, thats just because we're, uh, standing on opposite sides.
How do you know it was her dude?
Yap..
Not that much.
Oh no no no, they don't want to join us.
Did you see the way she pointed at the check? She gave me the finger.
Cheryl, Elaine, and uh, Jerry.
Give him the jacket.
That's not Irish.
We need to talk.
Aw great. Now the volume knob fell off
Yeah-hah!
After consummation.
Yeah.. may - maybe I'll meet ya?
Hey.
Ah hah. You see Father, Im Im incredibly anxious to become a member. Um, dont you offer any kind of an express conversion? A quick change?
Because, you're not a dermatologist.
That's funny. You're a funny guy.
Yeah. Hey, thanks for doing this.
All right there you go. It's a '47 cabin all right. So, we'll see you tomorrow.
All right. You wanna know what one of her favorite expressions is? Happy, Pappy?
What, are you crazy? It's a traumatic thing to be thrown up on.
Give 'im the jacket already!
It's possible.
Who are you to decide?
It looks like it hasn't been washed.
She bought.
The psychic said something terrible will happen.
Yeah, hold on. I'm, uh, I'm just trying to get a reading on my dashboard compass. Where are my parents?
It's very complicated.
You what?
Handicap? (gesturing to his cane) Oh, I'm not handicapped.
This is gonna be fun.
Uh, yeah, I'll be there in a minute.
He poked me!
Okay. That's what we know.
Here we go.
(Quick, excited talking) Hey, hey! You can't believe this. Look at this check! (Hands it to Jerry) They told me I had the most beautiful hands they'd ever seen in their lives - except for this McKigney guy - this great looking girl gave me her phone number.. I got it! I got it all! I'm busting. Jerry, I'm busting!
You wha?
(inside bathroom) Nah.
So, check out my view.
How ya doin'?
You gonna sleep on the fold-out?
Hey, I work for Kruger Industrial Smoothing "We don't care, and it shows."
Did you ever solve the riddle of the pie?
Hey. It's me.
Who was flirting with you?
You don't trust my poker face?
Oh don't-
Alright, maybe I do. So what.
It's a big flat noodle.
Next Friday, what time?
He wouldn't put it on if he didn't like it.
No, no, no... Just a *tiny* bit... It's not even *frontal* nudity. It's... *sidal* nudity...
Uh, excuse me. Uh, pound of Arabian mocha java, please.
Hey by the way my parents really want to have your parents over dinner before they leave town.
Yes, I mentioned your name.
How ya doing?
Pst. (moves in close with Elaine and Jerry) Wilkinsons got a bite on a new one. Petramco Corp. Out of, uh Springfield. I think. Theyre about to introduce some sort of a robot butcher.
(clears his throat) Im, uh, Im an architect.
How can you call yourself a clown and not know who Bozo is?
Well, I wanna talk to him about this.
I think I understand this. Jay Peterman is real. His biography is not. Now, you Kramer are real.
(to passerby) Hey, he-hah. It's June, June.
She dragged me down to that warehouse on the waterfront in Brooklin to see one of her "performances".
(Nervous) What are you talking about?
Eh, gee, I hope you have the key for these things.
No.
Oh no, thank you.
Grateful? How can you be grateful when you're *so* close to the end? When you know that any second-- Poof! Bamm-O! It can all be over. I mean you're not stupid, you can read the handwriting on the wall. It's a matter of simple arithmetic, for Gods sake...
Behind the dugout, that's where we were sitting the other day.
Yes, the surprise blindfold greeting. That wasnt in the manual, I dont know.
Hey. Hey. Answer me! Come on, show yourselves!
Sometimes at restaurants she talks to her food 'Ooh, Mr. Mashed Potatoes, you are sooo goood.'
Yeah, and a whole new me. I'm up two inches in these babies!
I don't know where you're getting this from. I....you're serious aren't you? Oh, (laughing) you see? You see, you just don't know my sense of humor. Dan, don't I joke around all the time?
"...It's the chicken"
Hey, so get this. I get a call this morning from one of the Mets front office guys. They wanna take me out to lunch.
Festivus, Sir. And, uh, I was afraid that I would be persecuted for my beliefs. They drove my family out of Bayside, Sir!
Ok. Good. And Kramer, you're in charge of taping off the loading zone.
This is incredible!
He he he he
Well hello. Um, ah, specifically the reason that I'm here, uh, I don't know uh what Elaine told you but uh I broke up with my girlfriend a couple of weeks ago. Actually she broke up with me [struggling with his coat zipper] and uh, well, I was the cause of it and uh, I just wanted to find out from you ... What's with this thing?
It's a cleaning.
I need higher. This has paba in it, I need paba-free.
Yeah, what do you do when you run out of laundry?
It's not him!
How could that piece of *crap* cost $98.00!?
And a guy will appear from out of nowhere. I say "Get out of here! What do you want? You don't belong here!"
So, I could do that?
*I* think that *you* think that a certain *something* is not all that it could be, when in fact it is is all that it *should* be, and *more*!
Im an architect.
Sand. It's everywhere
Would you stop it. (Susan playfully bites his ear lobe again) Would you quit it please. Someone is going to see us here.
So eh, what do you say?
You faked?
Ade you are incredible
Roll up your sleeve.
Oh. You still wanna go?
Oh yeah! Middle finger, straight up, at me! At us!
Me either.
I tried! I almost threw it down the incinerator, but I couldn't do it. The guilt was too overwhelming. (Grabs the doll, opening the door to leave) Susan's so attached to this thing.
Who?
I guess that leaves me in the clear...
Of course it's cashmere.
Isn't it?
And I love you, Marisa.
No everything is *not* going good. I'm very uncomfortable. I have no power. I mean, why should she have the upper hand. *Once* in my life I would like the upper hand. I have no hand-- no hand at all. She has the hand; I have *no* hand...
Yes it is! You're very charming!
(smiling) Yes sir.
You think she liked me? She seemed to like me.
The old man got to me.
He's a sports writer for the daily news. I find him very insightful...
KEITH HERNANDEZ?
I didn't know he'd get fired.
Yeah. What time is it?
We're straightening out!
I-I'm sure if you weren't satisfied you would probably say something wouldn't you?
Yea I-I know about the cups.
She put them in her pocket book. She probably took them out there with her.
Ha ha. Everything's timed out to perfection, Jerry. Slippery Pete's got the Frogger running on battery power, the truck will be there any minute, and Kramer's taped out the loading zone.
That is an opening.
(to Jerry) How could we not hear anything? What's with this Russel? What's he doing? (Jerry raises his arms and shoulders like he doesn't know)
You know what? I could probably do this. Whats the difference.
Of course he liked it.
I had the arm! Joe...
I didn't do it! It..It just got done. I don't know how it got done, but it did.
I didn't get any bread.
It's Allison. I dated her right after you. She's obsessed with me.
Nothing.
That's amazing.
Jon Voight?
Tell me about the free facial.
So I still haven't heard about that job.
I got engaged. I'm getting married. I asked Susan to marry me. We're getting married this Christmas.
Ahh, ladies, please, please. (chuckles)
I want you to have this job. Of course...
Who doesn't like cashmere? Find me one person in the world that doesn't like cashmere. It's too expensive.
What is that with the shmoopy?
Yeah, yeah. Just delivering some presents to my folks.
Well, I gotta go back there and try again. Hi Sheila.
Five-thousand? Why would anybody buy Kramer for $5000? (laughs)
And she slaves to earn every penny. So that someday, I might be able to walk up to a woman and say, "Yes, I'm bald, but I'm still a good person."
There's a hundred different things here. What's the difference between these two? (They each grab a box and check the ingredients) You got propylparabin?
Why not?!
You are a good friend. You know what? Even if you killed somebody I wouldn't turn you in.
(interrupts her) You know what. I don't think I'm going to be able to stay over tonight.
(dread) Oh god.
They wish. I hate the big broker-houses. Hate them with a passion. Big broker-houses killed my father.
Well I am actually going to have a secretary and I get to do the interview.
(anxious) I forgot who I am! Who am I?!
(adamant) Ah, c'mon! I'm telling you, I can coach for the NFL. It's not that hard
Wha - what happened? What are you doing back so soon?
Im aware of you. (to Jerry) All right, lets go (opens the bathroom door) Lets go!
I don't know.
Shhh What is wrong with you? You never tell 'em you like the car. (Advising) You're not sure what you want. You don't even know why you're here.
Well the sex was okay, but I threw up from the Hennigans.
What's all this?
Yeah. (another pause) Not that I care, one way or the other, but these doctors today really do amazing things, you know, if you were so inclined. And again, I'm not suggesting.
Yes.
Wow,  god! You see this is all I think about. Sleeping with a giant. It's my life's ambition.
I need to look for my glasses.
What side?
Well, that doesn't mean anything!
Hands a little smelly?
No, no, not really. Ever since Susan passed on, I have good days and bad. (Turns the briefcase towards the woman on his left.) Some days, I'm haunted by one word - why. Why Susan? Why wasn't it me licking those invitations? Why am I still here? Well, I gotta run. (Gets up and leaves the meeting.)
I know, I know. Listen, your stuff has to be done by now, why dont you just see if its dry?
She happens to be very good friends with her.
Ask' em Are there any side effects?
I mean you're just, you're just a marvel of organization.
(frustrated) Fine. Fine. (to customer) Excuse me. (heading for the door) Think I'm gonna forget about this? I haven't forgotten about this. I don't forget that easily!
( to Jerry) What about the letter, should I think about the letter?
Please.
I'm George. George Costanza, you live around here?
(glances in mirror) Alright. Alright.
(broken, shouts) Gary Fogel never had cancer!
What kind of operation is it?
"Arrrrrrgh!! .. It's George.. Oh! Sports wholesaler. yeah. yeah. .. thanks for calling back. No , no , no still got the shoes, still got the shoes. Lots of them. This is.. beautiful athletic gear."
Yeah I guess. What can I do? I gotta take her with me. Todd introduced us, I'm obligated.
Oh.
Hey.
Me? It wasn't me I never even saw the ball. All you do is dribble.
Hey, hey, hey! I dig.
There's porn.
I might tell her that I love her. I came this close last night, then I just chickened out.
It's break up by association. Besides, she's mad at me anyway because of my birthday present.
Well, it's a funny idea.
No, no. I reached down and there was *nothing* there.
Sh, sh, goodbye, sh, get away.
Well, no.
So she coughed.
(standing) All right, I'm gonna move my car, my meter's up. Can't park in this city.
All right.
Claire, Claire, youre a woman, right?
And then I took my pants off.
Oh great.
Yoohoo ,Plenty......Wh..wh..what are doing hum...you're going in?
Where?
Because. There was a lot of cake lying around the house. Just sitting there going with all the excess milk from all the experiments [grins]
I couldn't have breakfast, it was lunchtime! The three hour time difference threw me. I wanted a tuna fish sandwich, they wouldn't serve me tuna fish sandwich, because they were only serving breakfast.
"step off"?
Well, we just blew 240 bucks on a wheelchair.
No, you said you didn't like it...
No, no...I hate the condom.
Because! Because, as the leader...if I die...then all hope is lost! Who would lead? The clown? Instead of castigating me, you should all be thanking me. What kind of a topsy-turvy world do we live in, where-where heroes are cast as villains? Brave men as cowards?
Alright see? We got something there.
Oh, please. (to the teller) Can you change this into bills?
Huckleberry, Raspberry...
(Puts nuts into his mouth, and in the process covers his mouth) We bring her to the party, and she can tell me what Gwen is saying about me.
Where are you meeting these women? When they get off the bus at the port authority?
She ate breakfast naked?
(Looking over the writing materials they just bought) Bics? What, d'ja get, bics?
Just take it off. I'm getting hot just looking at it.
Yeah, yeah. Speaking of crazy, did you hear about Lloyd Braun?
(Angry) Yeah, that's what they told me the last time.
Tsst...'Course I have. Come on. My cousin's in a bubble. My friend Jeffrey's uh, sister, also ... bubble ... you know. I got a lot of bubble experience. Come on.
Yeah, don't worry. He can afford it.
So, tell him you're concerned about it and he should see someone else.
Oh, uh...
Absolutely nothing.
Oh, oh. Uh, you know. It's the damndest thing. I, uh, I moved recently and my files, pfff, disappeared. Now, I-I don't know if they fell off the truck or if there was some sort of foul play but let me tell you something. I'm not through with that moving company.
Yeah, I'm gonna let it go.
I was throwing up all night. It was like my own personal Crying Game.
Well, it's less than twenty-four hours, so I guess I have to!
No, I don't have any change.
A little notice would've helped! How many people?
Well what would be the point of that?
No...
(disbelief) What?! They're stealing the name?! That's my name, I made it up!
Shut your traps and stop kicking the seats! We're trying to watch the movie! And if I have to tell you again, we're gonna take it outside and I'm gonna show you what it's like! You understand me? Now, shut your mouths or I'll shut 'em for ya, and if you think I'm kidding, just try me. Try me. Because I would love it!
Gotta tell you I'm pretty comfortable.
Yeaah, beautiful... (They try to hit a high five, but George hits Elaine in the forehead.) Sorry...
That's the question, Jimmy.
(Standing in the doorway) I'm fine with it! Fi-hi-hi-hine I say! (Leaves)
All right, I'm gonna find a guy with a truck. GLC must live on!
You're making more than I am.
Dad, you know what it takes to compete with Microsoft and IBM?
Hey, what this thing? Whew!
Medium turkey chili.
It's about nothing.
(sidling in) Is this a bad time? I hope I'm not disturbing anything.
No one's putting a gun to your head. Do I, uh, scare you?
Yeah, so?
(Obviously lying) No.
Oh I hate to hear this. That kind of growth really irritates me.
Who's this, Blue Arrow?
All righty, no reason for us to uh, raise our voices.
No, I fake limp on my right. This is a real limp because I sprained my ankle.
I'm going out with her tomorrow, she said she had some errands to run.
Well how could you just play your message in front of anybody?
I heard the last guy got fired because his nose whislted.
Listen, I gotta ask you I was a little concerned that perhaps I was responsible in some way for your, uh... metamorphosis.
I'm sorry. I can't live knowing Ted Danson makes that much more than me. Who is he?
Das kaffes un salat e grand por favor.
This woman left this really sexy message on Jerry's tape recorder......
What are you talking about, that's seventy-five bucks! I'm not working, I can't afford that.
It's my only hope.
You know, you know what's great about our relationship?...It's not about looks.
All right, enough! Enough! From now on, no more yada yada's. Just give me the full story.
Really?
She stole twenty dollars from me. (getting angry) Yeah, I might've gotten it back, but Lloyd Braun interfered!
Yeah, you gotta do it classy (wipes his mouth to his sweater.)
Yes, it was very, very good.
I can't imagine.
Hey (sees the coffee stain) Art Garfunkel?
Well, it worked when I met George Peppard last week.
I've matured.
Wait a minute, wait a minute, do you think I?m comfortable here. I can't change, I?ve got no clothes here! You've got to go like that, I can?t go like this alone!
What did I get or what do I say I got?
I just wanted a second opinion.
Yeah, when the season starts. Right now, I sit around pretending that I'm busy.
I love Juu-uuu-uu-uune!
(spits out mouthful of food) Mrs. Enright! Mrs. Enright!
Oh what's the difference? We'll all be dead eventually.
That wasn't a laser pen.
Yes, of course I'm taking Allison. This woman is genetically engineered to go to a ball. Tall, blonde, lithe--
(looking at the door) He's starin' at us.
Mr. Pensky. I was just working on your file. I was transferring the contents of the file into this flexible accordion-style folder.
Of course I'm not Cartwright! Look, why don't you two just go to the movies all by yourselves, I'm not in the mood.
Yeah?
Maybe it's got something to do with that 42 in the corner .
(To Carl) Oh, by the way, order anything you want, it's all on me. Just do me a tiny favor pretend we're old friends. Oh my God! Mr. Morgan! What a coincidence, it's Mr. Morgan. Mr. Morgan, I want you to meet a dear old friend of mine, Carl.
(little worried) Coffee? (thinks) I can beat that. Move in with me.
(clearing his throat, he changes his order for Susan) Baked, uh, potato.
Actually, I never had any formal training. I guess I'd be better suited for improvs, or something..
I don't. Susan wants to have it out when Sally comes tomorrow.
Me too. I've been yelling at strangers on the street.
(quieter desperation) They took my belt, Jerry. I got nothing to hold my pants up. (listens) Well, you gotta come over here now! Just tell 'em what we talked about, how I, how I, I didn't do the project.
I know!
(Getting in a more panicked state) Oh God, Mommy!
Well, Steven, I, uh.. (All the sudden, a small gang steps out of nowhere, surrounding George)
(laughs) hu hu.
(to Kramer) This man is a genius. Genius!
I could take it in merchandise..
I told I had a bus transfer that was only good just for another hour.
It just does.
Sir?
After dark? Please. At their age, that's like swallowing stun grenades.
Yes. Very nice to have had her to mention... (starting to leave)
I thought you said one oclock.
Susan! Jerry! Where are you? I know you're there! Answer me!
(dryly) You're on that list.
In a manner of speaking.
(singing) Master of the house/Doling out the charm/Ready with a handshake and an open...
Very.
Hey!
I thought you meant the..
Alright, alright, fine. (Gives the keys to Elaine.)
Is it, uh, doable?
It's a coincidence.
It's my name. I made it up. You can't just steal it.
(not believing him) You what?!
Huh, strawberries, anyone? (eats a strawberry) Ah, that's good. Ooh, juicy this time of year.
He's on the lamb(?), he's on the loose!
I don't like when a woman says, 'Make love to me', it's intimidating. The last time a woman said that to me, I wound up apologizing to her.
Now, you see, I don't get that. We had a relaxed stimulating, great conversation, she doesn't mention it? Why doesn't she mention it?
Who do you like?
I don't have my ATM card.
Well, Danielle, (digs in his pocket) we should get going. I got a key made for you.
HI ELAINE...
Shst, You should take the test for me.
Your hose! Where's your hose?!
I had a job interview.
Yeah.. yeah, we're - we're cool. (Knocks lightly. Kramer takes charge by knocking on the door louder. The busboy answers) Uh, I'm sorry to bother you, I was in the restaurant earlier and I was wondering if I could talk to you for a few minutes about what happened. (He gestures for them to come in. They obey) I hope I'm not interrupting anything. It's just that I think I may have - without realizing it - been responsible for getting you fired. (Nervously laughs) And.. and.. and I just want you to know that I didn't intend for that to happen.
(disappointed) Oww.
They, uh... said you were with some guy who was wearing a cape?...
I had to listen to a five minute discussion on which one is actually called shmoopy.
Aah, yeah, yeah. Won't you head on in, we'll be in in a second. Be right with you.
I feel fat.
Gotta get the good ones.
I don't know. (George sits down at the table. Kramer enters.)
I'm gonna play frolf.
Well I like Dylan.
An' wait'll you see the dress that she's got. It's backless! Uh?! I'm finally gonna make a Great Entrance!
That's no tragedy! How many people do you lose on a normal cruse? 30? 40?! Kramer, can I take a look at that book? (Starts walking tward the door. Kramer grabs his food, and follows)
Rest stop supply.
Yeah, six weeks.
Thanks. You know this could sound crazy but, what do you think about adding a drawer for - like a blanket?
No no no, he's not getting away with this.
He's actually doing him a favor. It's less money for him to buy food.
What? He's outside?
No?
Ooh!
I'd rather go to a hanging.
Maybe he didnt show up.
(smile) Yeah.
No. It didn't take.
Bozo?
I shouldn't even tell you this.
(Impersonating Carson) I didn't not know that. Weird. Wild. (Susan and George both laugh)
Anyway.
Hey uh, isn't Elaine supposed to meet us?
His personal file, I, I don't ask...
I wanna go to a tractor pull.
So you're buying the car back for your parents?
Well, I can't crack this one.
Oh yes, of course, and we have to be fair. (placing the suit further away in the rack)
A decent hotel-room...
You know, a muffin can be very filling.
Ill just, uh, get a paper...
So she doesn't like me?
I- I'm pretty sure I left it eh, behind the cushion of the chair ... accidentally.
I can't do these puzzles.
Tell you about the Portuguese waitress.
(gets up and picks a mirror) Yes. Yes, it's white. Why it's white.
(phone rings ,picks up) Operator? Beijing?
Aw, hoh, oh Deena, thank God. (he hugs Deena) Thank God you're here. Listen, you gotta help me. You gotta tell these people that I'm okay. You know that I don't belong in here.
He's a jerk. (nudges to his right but no one is there)
Ooh, a shower cap!
What paper does she write for?
Cut it.
Well, maybe so...but it was good enough for Mr. Jon Voight.
Of course he is. There's got to be houses for rent in Tuscany. Do you know how big Tuscany is?
Done what?
It's just paper on a roll, that's it. And that's all it will ever be.
Yeah. I got 'em down to fifty bucks. I just have to do all the jackhammering myself.
An idea for the show.
It's open!
Ah-Ha! (he turns and walks over to the refrigerator)
Do me a favor would you? Would you change lanes? Would you get outta this lane. You gotta get out of this lane. This lane stinks. They're all double parked here Please get outta this lane. I'm beggin you please please.
Pudding skin singles.
Oh I missed the Maestro?
I dont know. Theyre books.
Ow! Hot! Hot!
And I didnt even ask her out. She asked me out first. She called me up. What was I supposed to do? Say no? (laughs) I cant do that to someone.
You mean, uh..?
Who?
oh, . . .because she handed you the bag. I could have handed you the bag. She happened to pick it up at the restaurant even though, . . .
Who, the Croat? [the tennis player]
I think you absolutely have to say something to this guy. Confront him.
You know, we absolutely should.
And maybe we could go out and do something.
Anyway it's kind of a fluke thing but uh I'll be leaving for Paris in two days. I will send you a postcard when I get there.
All right, where do you want it?
No, it's a Newman. Well, I gotta run. (Smiles, pats his briefcase and exits.)
How would you like a 'Hare Krishna' fist on your throat, you little punk?
T-bone steak.
kissed me. We both had tears streaming down our faces. I never saw anyone so beautiful. It was at that moment that I decided to tell her that, I was not a marine biologist.
Okay.
Well, it's all for charity, so what's the difference.
Well you see he slipped, and he landed on a kinda of a..
'Kay. I'll uh, I'll see you later. Anybody want some tomatoes?
It's Susan
You hurt me.
Yeah, I feel like I've grown.
Oh.
D'oh...Oh, oh, the judge! I hate this guy!
No No I'm working on a system...Who was that?
Nothing except Prognosis Negative.
You can do better than me. You could throw a dart out the window and hit someone better than me. I'm no good!
I take it off when I go to the, uh, y'know, to the "office".
The little extra moan you threw in there. Laying it on a bit thick, don't you think?
If you don't mind, sir. I'll be here at 8.
I can't eat with you leanin' over like this. Just look straight forward.
Where?
Th... this isn't mine.
Heh, haa. And that's no good. I've tried it straight, Jerry. We've all seen the results. For me, sick is the only way to go.
Yes, for a sales position. Latex salesman, the selling of latex, and latex related products. They just wouldn't give me a chance.
Awright, listen, can you uh, gimme a lift back to my place?
(visibly disturbed) I...I..I dunno.
'Scarsdale surprise'. That's the musical about that Scarsdale diet doctor murder.
It's two completely different sounds. "ih" and "eh".
Bologna?! No one eats bologna anymore!
I can't have an affair with a married woman, that's despicable!
Really? I never heard of a semi (the "i" sounds like an "e") tractor-trailer. (Jerry nods in agreement)
No.
So, did you get your new plates?
No.
(coyly, he looks down and runs his finger along the top of the chair back in front of him) Do you, uh ... do you know what Im ... thinking about now?
I think things were going ok. We were having a nice conversation.
No one hails a cab like me. My hailing technique is unmatched. I get the wrist going from side to side and boom! Cabs are crashing into themselves to just pick me up. (a cab stops) All right, here we go. Let me get door. Feminists aside, I know women like the door holding. Here we are all righty. O.K. Jodi let's get together again real soon and say hello to your sister for me.
Canceled? Do I still get credit for the pick up? I was here!
Oh, I understand. (George exits; Sees Kramer in the hallway) Hey.
The perfect combination of Mountain Dew and mozzarella...just the right amount of grease on the joy stick...
uh Tony? there's not gonna be too many sandwiches
Wha? Did you use those? These are guest soaps! (he grabs the soaps and begins examining them for damage)
Yeah!
Alright, just make sure he reserves the good chair for me. Wait, what are you gonna tell him about the clanking noise in the car?
No no.
I'm trying to buy some of the clothes back. (realizing something) Hey you wanna come over for dinner tonight? My mother made all this extra Paella.
I though we said we weren't going to discuss that now!
If youre a spirit, and you can travel to other dimensions and galaxies, and find out the mysteries of the universe, you think shes gonna wanna hang around Drexlers funeral home on Ocean Parkway?
Oh hey, by the way. Do you want a box 'a, Cuban cigars? I smoked one last night. I got nauseous.
Wa.. He doesn't have to tell her.
I had a job interview.
I want evens.
[trying to act as if he doesn't care one way or the other, but we know better] Either way.
Yeah, it's me sir. It's been a harrowing few days. uuh,After the car accident, I-I crawled into a ditch, and managed to survive on, grubs and puddle water, until a kindly old gentleman picked me up.
What, what happened? Where's, where's all the stuff?
Hey, he,
So you're Jason Hanke's supervisor?
(leaving the european accent) No. (laughs)
Who goes to the Super Bowl with their mailman?!
The Indian?
(nods to Kramer) Tell him, Kramer.
What is that, Boyfriend? I don't understand that. What, what does she think I asked her out for?
I'll tell you something, I've never seen a pilot script as funny as this!
Oh no! Im vigilant. Theyll never get me out. Im like a weed, Jerry.
I just want the both of you to know how much you mean to me, and I love you both very, very much.
They send me? Aw right ..ask 'em Does it really work?
Happy Festivus! (Sees Elaine) Yama - Hama!
No, Im saying, if a situation arose in which you didnt want it, I might take it.
Hey! Surprise, surprise!
Innocent mistake.
All right... here goes...
Oh, I was trying to make a point.
You know what you should do? You should tell this guy you're seeing somebody else. That's the easiest way to get out of these things.
Elaine.
What?
Well, I'm the good boy again. Can you believe that?
(Silently squinches his mouth and nods at Kramer)
Every time we go out to eat the minute we we're done eating she's runnin to the bathroom.
So let me ask you a question about the tip jar. I had a little thing with the calzone guy this week. I go to drop a buck in the tip jar and just as I am about to drop it in he looks the other way. And then when I am leaving he gives me this look think thanks for nothing. I mean if they don't notice it what's the point.
All right, no more lies. Elaine is been chosen to represent the Upper West Side in the next Biosphere project.
Oh...(is about to tell Jerry, but reconsiders) ...clothing, something, I dunno. So, uh, what are you doing today?
La-la-la...
I couldn't take it anymore.
Aw, Kramer, don't start...
Time like what? I'm hungry. My stomach doesn't know that Kramer's wanted.
Excuse me?
Hey! Uh--listen--did you get your--uh--boss's Knick ticket, for Kramer?
Dollar Eighty-Nine. Why is this a dollar eighty-nine? Why is there no haggling in this country?
Yea Yea Yea
I cant believe I said that. You know me, Im a vault.
We're not dead.
That's a lot of pressure. Make love to me. What am I, in the circus? What if I can't deliver?
Know what? Ponce De Leon is sold out.
Jerry, can I talk to you for a second? (They enter Jerry's apartment)
Well, you didn't hear it from me, but needless to say, if you go in there - stick with the consumee.
Really good looking?
Oh no - I'm so sorry, it's the Moops. The correct answer is the Moops.
Well, she doesn't really want to see Firestorm.
Yeah! Yeah.
What's that?
No, I saw "Home Alone II".
Yeah. What are you doing with the Daily Worker?
What? I'm comfortable.
You mean, like, a former member?
Oh, art!
I am in and out of my personnel file at work all the time.
Excuse me, where are we?
(leaving) Yeah, Sure, sure ,,, I got to drop my car off at the new lot.
I like to stop at the duty free shop.
No, you just tell him ah, an old boyfriend has come back into your life.
Would you wait a second? Just wait? (They fight over it.)
No, there'll be girls there.
Well I don't want to get into a big dispute about the pants.
I I just.. but..
You know, I'm down to one kiss hello. My aunt Sylvia.
Yeah?
That's why I peeked. (Jerry opens the door to take some trash out, and meets Kramer and Gail in the hallway.)
(crafty) Not necessarily. Why don't you take back the couch you gave me?
No, I won't.
Do you know how much this is going to cost me?
Please.
Should we be talkin' about this?
You mean she just laid there topless?
Well, personal, I mean, we both uh...
We're gonna hang around here a little while....something funny going on here
'Stanky Hanke'? What did he want?
Yeah. A couple of people. I don't get that, though. Where do you start?
No. (dips the chip) You dip the way you want to dip...(bites the chip) I'll dip the way I want to dip. (dips the chip again.)
[studying his jacket] Oh man! Look at this! I sat in gum. Oh, by the way, you owe me seven fifty.
Didn't hear anything...
She's, uh, she's heard of Merlot.
All right, all right. Thats it. Im gonna go down there.
Really good?
(Eating) Oh yeah. These are fantastic, fantastic. (To server) You know, I'd love to get a jump on the next batch, where do you come out? (Server leaves) (To Anna) She's been ignoring this section all night. Quesadilla?
Murphy Brown, the TV show.
Then who are the Dutch?
Hehummm , Yeah!
Yeah! You're right.. You're probably right.
Mick Jagger.
What red dot? What are you talking about? Jerry come here for a second. Do you see anything here?
What do you mean not goin'? Come on, we got plans here. Call her up.
It means a non-Jewish woman.
(On the other line) Hey.
Hi. I-I really should be getting back to my fianc, you know, we, uh, we had this big fight yesterday and, uh, well she, she wants to-to know my secret code. I-I don't know, I can't tell her. The funny thing is, you know, I would really love to tell someone 'cause it's killing me. You uh, you wanna know what it is? It's Bosco. You know, the chocolate syrup? I love that stuff, I pour it in milk, it's my favorite drink. Hoo-hoo, boy, that is a relief!
Listen. You're beautiful. You're intelligent. You'll meet other girls...
Hey.
( rubbing his eye) Ow, Ow you squirted me.
Oh! no no nothing....
Marsala?
. . . I'm a little scared of her.
Anyway, I think everything else is okay. Unless of course she's faking.
Yeah, Like I don't know that I'm pathetic.
You took me to one of your shows..
Lloyd Braun? What d'you have to meet him for?
(Talking about his would-be apartment) You could fit 15 people in that bathroom..
Yeah, there was a fire in my apartment.
Why even try anymore? There's no sense to it. I'm never gonna meet anybody, I should just accept it.
And I cancelled plans to go to the movies with them tonight.
Oh, hi...
( mouth full) Hi, this is fantastic ( puts the pit in the a plate)D'you ever had a Macanaw peach?
(waves his hands) Big breasts!
At the funeral, give or take. You know, deep down, I always kinda felt that they blamed me for Susan's death.
I can't carry any changes in these pants, it falls out.
I suppose he could swivel. Hey maybe one of those director's chairs. What do you think of those.
(passes cane from right to left and back a few times) But, see here. Right. Wrong. Right. Wrong. Right. Right. Wrong--
I know.
Jerry, my vacation just started. I need a day or two to de-compress. Besides, I did plenty today.
Like what? What could they say?
Of course he should consider it, but now is not the time!
I have tell you, I'm pretty impressed with the first one.
I would give anything to be going up those stairs again.
Hi. George.
Yeah, it's bizarre. (they both look around them suspiciously)
You put a hot tub... in your living room?
Yeah, good luck. Hey I'll meet you outside.
Do you believe this guy?
Youre a back-up, youre a second-line, a just-in-case, a B-plan, a contingency!
Oh yeah, like you know.
Ah, listen ah, I don't mean to bother you but ah, silly me, I- I think I may have left my hat in your apartment. So ah, I thought I'd just come by later and pick it up.
Hey.
Cause I tell you, frankly, I would like to walk in hear one day and find you sitting down. (Starts to walk out of the store) That would give me a lot of pleasure. Call me crazy.
Please, doctor.
Wha! You know, it's a pain to change that. You gotta lift up that plastic thing with a pen.
Elaine and her sponges...she's got like, a war chest full of them.
Hey, 'The White Shadow' is on...
OK, ah.. (George throws his keys on the table) see ya!
Oh, no. No. No. No. No. Nothing. I'm fine. Everything's fine. Fine. Just get a little nervous on the weekends, that's all. Could I, uh, could I get a glass of water?
Oh, I was gonna pay for this.
Well, wait a little while, Ma. What's the difference?
So uh where we eating?
People can drop change down here, Jerry. And theyre too lazy to pick it up.
Apparently the glue in the wedding invitations was a....toxic.
It's good. Believe me.
Yeah, huh.
Not with that big glass window looking out into the hall. I'd love a good nap. That's the only thing getting me out of bed in the morning. I'll see ya'.
She tolerated the strawberries and the chocolate sauce, but eh, it's not a meal, you know? Food and sex, those are my two passions. It's only natural to combine them.
Oh, o.k., yeah. Where am I gonna park here...? (Pulls over.)
Hey, look at this. This is the same massage chair we're gettin' for Joe Mayo, $60 cheaper.
Monica, I'm really focused here, this stuff's a killer. (turns to the next page)
Can't live!
You know, it's very impolite to tell secrets. Are you talking about me?
Because Im not Latvian Orthodox. Her parents wont let her get involved with anyone who isnt Latvian Orthodox.
Look, I gotta tell ya...I been thinkin' about it, I just don't feel right about letting you into Elaine's apartment.
I wasn't talking to you.
I saw Siena again.
"No!...not...nothing."
Why not?
(agitated) Well, I, I couldn't come. I, I had to drive my mother to, to the chiropodist.
He did that?
She's off. (goes over to the now available public phone)
Because you called her by the wrong name.
I got me an appointment with a hardware store. I'm not saying I want to do it for the rest of my life, but, uh, hardware fascinates me. Don't you love to make a key?
No, no. It wasn't a shift, I've shifted, this was a move.
But I'm backing in! You can't put it in head first!
All right, all right, two fifty.
You're calling her?
She must have seen me eating it on TV.
Well, it's about Holly Go-Lightly.
My parents. It's their anniversary. I'm taking them out to dinner and a show tonight. You think we'll hit traffic?
Yes! Yes, I heard the 'squink'!
You know, I got this little swelling right here. (rolls up his sleeve to expose his wrist) It's kinda painful. What d'you make of it?
Wait a second. (George gets up and heads for the statue in Kramers hands.) I cant believe this! Let me see this.
Ah, not yet.
(dismayed) I didn't even know you wanted to get serious!
Huh-Hi. (looks around a little) Uhm, is Neil here?
Teasing.
Party?
But I'm not a marine biologist!
You think your parents would have any objections to taking a little kid to Paris with them? (Jerry looks at him confused) It turns out that the kid's father lives in Paris. (chuckling) Is that a coincidence? (Jerry smilies) Eh you know Alec wants me to take him over there so I figure as long as they're going (claps)
Wow, he really does a number on you. (reads) "Seinfeld froze like a deer in the headlights in the face of incessant heckling."
Shes right above you?
Oh please.
So, what do you think?
Well, what are you gonna do?
(high-fiving) Hey!
Ahh, Steinbrenner gave 'em to us, in honour of Phil Rizzuto being inducted into the Hall of Fame.
A vet?
Yes!
oh Tony don't
I don't know, she said she had to pick up a friend of hers at the airport. It cost me a hundred dollars this ticket.
Right.
I've done that. Did you ever eat an ostrich burger?
Hey, Tim.
No problem here.
Better get that checked out?
I dunno.
Sure, Guatamala...
And on your dates.
You don't remember me?
You lie! How hard is it to lie?!
Oh, she didn't think it was funny. What is she, Rowan & Martin? We're supposed to meet with NBC tomorrow! She completely shattered my confidence. And I'm paying for this, she's my employee!
Yeah.
Yes, yes! The punishment should fit the crime.
Oh, what? What? That? Are you kidding? I didn't quit. What? You took that seriously?
Hey...you don't think...sure, that's Jon Voight's pencil!
Why shave every day? It just grows right back.
I can't say.
Yeah, with crutches everyone has questions.
Hunh, You know, it's the damnedest thing. I went out the window again to, to get a cup of coffee...
I think he should wear whatever tie he wants.
I... I... I long for you.
The, uh, actor that played Jesus made some odd choices.
I was betrayed! That kid was like a son to me. And if there's one person you should be able to hold down, it's your own flesh and blood. Like my father.. my father's father before him.
So uh... Wrath of Khan, huh?
This is nice.
Yes, I like to just be able to take the blankets and swish them and swirl them, you know what I mean? You know, I don't like being all tucked in. I like to have a lot of room, you know I like to have my toes pointed up in the air. Just like to scrunch up the blankets.
Timberlands. (Showing Elaine his boots)
By the way, have you spoken to Elaine yet today?
So we had a good time... the four of us.
Yes, flowers. I will get her flowers, I will go to the florist!
No difference. I could care less. She's Jerry's girlfriend.
These old guys, they're up at 4 a.m., by two thirty they're wiped. (animated) How did we get back onto you?!
So, she fell, and then she started screaming, "My back! My back!" So, I picked her up and took her to the hospital.
But she's gonna know that I like her more than she likes me.
You see what just happened here?
Or, I could take the twenty, then I could pay *you* later.
No, no. No, no, no. (determined) We're staying on me. We haven't solved anything yet.
What?
Hey, what about this? I'm in a car accident. The motorist is uninsured, you with me?
About six years ago.
Coulda fixed me up with Marisa Tomei. She said I was just her type!
Alright, look, you want to be in?
George, George Costanza!
From my pocket.
I am. The folks are twelve hundred miles away. (gleeful) I'm basking in the buffer zone. (looks for the waitress) 'Nother piece of pie here!
That's not the point. The point is I was here first.
Don't you see? I'm back in.
Oh, you're fine... you're fine. (looking at Tom in the back and then quieter to Jerry) So you think this guy playing Kramer took the raisins?
Oh, Rita. Hey, Mr. Shermack, how're you doing, good to see you. Jay, always a pleasure. (To Susan) Sweetie. (Kisses her and then sits down next to Jerry) Yeah, yeah, that butler idea, that's beautiful. Isn't that killer? (Aside to Jerry) I thought I was getting the butler.
oh,
Well this is bad. I am really in a bad situation now.
...velay.
Oh, this isn't even B.O.! This is *beyond* B.O.! It's *B*.B.O.!
Assistant to the General Manager!! Do you know what means?!? He'd could be askin' my advice on trades! Trades, Jerry, I'm a heartbeat away!
You know how easy it is for dead people to travel? Its not like getting on a bus. One second. (snaps his fingers) Its all mental.
Why did you refuse the package. Everybody loves a package.
I'm not stable? I'm like a rock. I take these glasses off, you can't tell the difference between me and a rock. I put these glasses on a rock. You know what jumps into most people's minds? Costanza!
I don't want to walk that far.
Well, you really did it to me this time, Seinfeld. . . . What the hell happened here?
(Nods) Uh-huh.
Yeah, well I uh got lots of other stuff to show you too. Wait till you see the plum job that I landed.
Ah, Pfft! What can you do? (looking at a tag on the suit) Is this the price tag?
What for? . I'll tell you what for.... for hair.
Superman's father on Krypton.
No, something's off here, you hesitated.
Gonna see her again?
How do you know?
But tell him to give me the--
Look at that guy. Right there. Isn't that the guy from the show? He's..he's wearing the jacket.
I got a feeling I'm gonna be much smarter than you pretty soon.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Chunnel . Susan!
Let's work on the card.
So uh where are the clothes?
Kramer. Guess what.
Excuse me Ms. which street are we on?
Who flips? Youll flip, Ill call.
Alright, alright!
(broaching a subject) Hey mom. What kind of woman was grandma?
Years. When we were kids, they made it seem like it was right around the corner.
Well, if I hear you correctly--and I think that I do--my advice to you is to finish your meal, pay your check, leave here, and never mention this to anyone again.
(Still on the showers) Can I use hot water on my face?
You think Kramer'll do it?
(indicates with his head) The cashier.
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. What about the pact?
Excuse me, sir, do you have the time?
Wow, just felt your material?
What, he can't jump out of the chair? How long does that take? Here look at this. (he moves to the end of the booth) Here, watch. (stands up) Criminals. Boom. I'm up. (pretends he's shooting) Stop It! Stop It! Stop It!
Hey!
Cinnamon? Why didn't cha get chocolate?
Maybe we should call her.
Well, it's not my fault. You poked me!
Hi, nice to meet you.
Look at that. They got lobster on the menu. Who would order a lobster here. I mean, do they bring a lobster in everyday hoping *todays* the day.
(to Jerry) It's all white Jerry! It's all white!
I know they're in there, the three of them, laughing at me. Together, laughing and lying.
You don't work in the rain? Your a mailman."Neither rain nor sleet nor snow....."It's the first one.
Hot? (Feels Tartabull's material.) What is this?
Yes Mr. Hayman.
Taste this, is this a dill?
Well I gotta undo what I did.
Hey, what's another million, give or take. I get off where and when I wanna get off.
What?
Oh yeah.
It was a fat camp. Those kids depended on me.
Why are two pretending to be laughing?
Oh, yeah, sure, laugh it up. Everybody else did!
I know.
(stops Jerry realizing something) Hey hey hey hey hey hey.
You find this interesting, don't you?
No. I--I paid for it.
I need a break, Jerry, you know. I gotta get out of the city. I feel so cramped...
Yeah, right.
If I was a different person.
Where?
No seriously...
Oh shut up.
I got him Yankee's tickets! He got me a piece of paper saying "I've given your gift to someone else!"
Maybe I could move them until you get back.
I can't believe you called me a chucker. No way I'm a chucker, I do not chuck, never chucked, never have chucked, never will chuck, no chuck!
Well, that's a given.
Wow! Heh. (Half kidding) You don't, huh, have a replacement lined up for me, do ya? heh he he he he he...
Well who schedules his wedding on Super Bowl Sunday?
God! She's cooking dinner for God! She's yelling and screaming, and the next thing I know, she throws a big can of chocolate syrup all over my new red shirt.
(To Jerry) Hey, gimme a dollar.
Ah, Oh boy.
She calls you today and she doesnt make a plan for tomorrow? What is that? Its Saturday night!
Um, excuse me, have you see a guy with like a horse face, big teeth, and a, and a pointed nose?
Betsy.
(let down) So, that's it?
Hi.
We really should be, uh, heading out..
Oh, nothing happened, but it was...
So? Where are we going?
De-compressing.
But...somebody like Gail, though.
Because you're a gymnastics teacher. It's only natural.
She's leaving me dirty messages on my answering machine.
(holding a magazine cover) Mira Sorvino. Think she'd go out with me?
I-I don't know. Last time I got the tap.
What for?
No. I did.
Witness.
Hey, what are you doing tonight?
I think so.
(Laughs slightly) A physician married to a salesman. (Chuckles) Well, I gotta tell you, Beth, you coulda done a lot better than him.
Yeah. Hmm. Boy these really do pinch. I tell you, if I ever find the son of a bitch that stole my glasses...
That took awhile.
(angry) Stickin' it!
Or maybe, she just wanted to go to the Tony's. I tell you what; you ask her out again. No Tony, just Jerry. That way you know it he was her dude or just some dude.
What are you saying?
This line is huge.
Jerry, for all I know this guy went out of his way to not invite you. How am I gonna feel if I show up with an uninvited, unwelcome intruder?
He's ripping you off
And I can make a left turn from the right lane too.
Hey, is that Tim Whatley?
Yeah, I may move out there. (getting 'yeah, right' glances from the Rosses) I mean it, I'll do it! OK, I'll see ya later. Keep it real!
Of course.
Me Too! And he's Dying Jerry! If Relationship George walks through this door, he will Kill Independent George! A George, divided against itself, Cannot Stand!
Me run in? Why don't you run in?
Ha! Ha! Hey! (moving his arms like it's so great to be all here)
(quietly) ahh.
It stinks.
[to himself] Argh! [to Susan] Susan! Hi! Oh, boy! What are you doing here?!
Maybe she's diabetic.
What, ... you are making some wisecracks in a night club... wo wo wo. The guy was in game SIX two runs down two outs facing elimination.
Yeah. (George hands over the prescription) Kramer...
Oh, well, so what? Laughter - what is that? I mean, what is the point of opening your mouth and going "Ha, ha!"? What is that? "Ha, ha!"?
Yeah, two for the 715 of Novaj pravas (?). What you're wearing the green sweater?
Kimbrough.
How do you know him?
(incredulous) I look just like him. I. Me. (flings his arms out) This! This is what her boyfriend looks like. How is that possible?
So, I broke up with Maura. It's done. I'm out.
Yeah, me too.
"HEY! JIMMY!!! ha ha ha........Great game."
They refuse to put cucumber in the salad. I need cucumber.
Really? At the tennis match?
This is Morning Mist.
Come on. Come on. Come on. Yeah. Yeah. (grunting)
No no no no no no no..
I got two tickets to see "Guys And Dolls".
I was telling you about Noel.
Aw c'mon, I'm eating here.
Well, Play Now is through playing. They turned the heat way up in my office. They tried to sweat me out.
Listen Jerry. With all due respect, Bania's voice is the voice of a new generation. My generation.
(getting up and leaving) Alright! That's it for me. Goodnight everybody.
You're in latex
There's no house! It's a lie! There's no solarium. There's no Prickly Pete. There's no other solarium.
Are you crazy? This is like discovering Plutonium ... by accident.
Yeah, right. I'll just go up and say, "Hi, how ya' doing? Would you like a glass of white wine?" JERRY Before you got within twenty feet of this woman, she'd have her finger on the mace button. She's like an expensive car with one of those motion-sensor force field alarms. Any sudden movement in the area could set her off.
You really think this looks O.K. on me?
So how long did you live there?
ha Ha..
Okay.
You wanna see?! (pulling off the hat to reveal the bald pate) There! There it is! (turning to Newman) Alright, here! You wanna try on the hat?! Here! Try on the hat!
Ohhhhhh
I said preferably cashmere, for warmth. So in front of the whole party, he says, 'No. I don't want you stretching out the neck hole.'
Well I-I...
I don't know why I'm doing this.
Those are my friends I was telling you about. We're gonna talk to them, pull over.
For lunch? Who eats eggs for lunch?
Oh, thank you.
Your buttocks are spectacular.
Okay. Uh, my mother is is going to pay for the sessions. ... Oh,Elaine?
You wanted to see me, sir?
(getting animated) Yeah. Yeah. You know the odds of me being anyone's type?! I have never been anyone's type, but apparently, this Marisa Tomei loves funny, quirky, bald men.
You know -- Elaine.
Me neither. I've never been happy.
Yes he is. Let me ask you something. When you come out of the shower and you put your robe on, do you cinch it real tight, are you concerned about that?
What if he's waiting for me outside? He pointed at me! Did you see him point?!
Yeah.
No.
Really? (Jerry shakes his head) Maybe this will become like a cool thing, living with your parents.
It's *not* *true*!
Of course you do.
Right.
Oh, gotta get fifty. Gotta get fifty. All right, I tell you what. We go to the coffee shop, you call your manager. Maybe they made an offer.
Yeah, well...a little rough finding something good in your price-range. (to Jerry) But you, my friend, may be in luck.
Not even close, huh?
Not that much. You know, they tend to shrink in the water.
I'm afraid I'm just not interested in how I present myself. If those kind of superficialities are important to you, this probably isn't gonna work.
About the pizza?
What happened to the auto show?
Please.
I don't think so, Vic. I've done my homework. '89 Volvo, that's the car for me, it's the one I want.
Anyway, I-I would like to-to pay for the cleaning.
Are we really doing this?
(puzzled) I bought it. (enters lobby)
Neeson? How are you comparing Liam Neeson with Jon Voight? Jerry, we're talking about Joe Buck. If you can play Joe Buck, Oskar Schindler's a cake walk. (Opens the car door for Jerry, Jerry's about to get in.)
I gotta stay one step ahead of Neil.
Yeah, Jimmy why don't you wait outside, you know, play with something.
I don't understand. They're supposed to be casting this week. Something's wrong. Maybe they're not doing it.
Shadow!
...So, anyway, if you think about it, manure is not really that bad a word. I mean, it's 'newer', which is good, and a 'ma' in front of it, which is also good. Ma-newer , right?
When I was working I spent baby.
The wedding is off. Now you can go to the Super Bowl.
Oh my God! What is that?!
Jon Voight, the actor?
So, um, you've read "The Big Game", have you?
What if her experience with me *drove* her to it?
I swear.
Where'd you meet her?
Listen. I want you guys to send along those agreements the minute you land. Our boys can't wait to kick your butts!
My cousin worked for Bouchard's. They used to use the bouilla-base for a toilet. (Jerry and Russell are shocked.)
I got a hotel room.
Oh. Who is this guy?
Well, that interests me very much Mr. Farkus.Very much indeed, sir.
He's alright?
Come on let's get out of here.
Alright, whatever! Now. Whatever caused the damage...(drops a tiny briefcase onto the table in the model)...was jarring enough to completely stop the tape.
I told her what a sexist he is. How he cheats on his wife.
Judgement, Jerry, judgement! You exercised no judgement.
Let me ask you this. If you stick your hand in the hair is it easy to get it out?
I remember.. (Leaves)
He was definitely sniffing.
Whatever.
Elaine, of course I'm concerned. I'm payin' for those meals. It's like throwing money down the toilet.
Im not doing that.
Yeah, but nothing happens on the show. You see, it's just like life. You know, you eat, you go shopping, you read.. You eat, you read, You go shopping.
Wait a minute, wait, it's not that stupid.
he's the first cool guy I've ever been friends with in my whole life. You know.. it's a different world when you're with a cool guy, he's not afraid of anybody. You should hear the way he talks to waitresses.. he gets free pie!
Maybe I'll get her some jewelry.
"There may be a problem with the phone, hold on"!
(walking towards the door) I couldn't leave well enough alone?!
How many days was it between encounters.
I didn't have make-up sex.
Yeah. She's uh, she's something, isn't she?
Hey. I got Jon Voight's LeBaron. (Jingles the keys.)
Well, it's just a game. Remember that, kids.
Yeah. Where's he taking you, by the way?
Thank you very much. Dylan?
What happened?
Thats it.
Early! Alright! (shivers.) Cold.
You?
Excuse me, did you say 'Raymond'?
That's a myth.
Why can't I stay?
(Pleading) Please, please, they're gonna hit me! (Attempts to grab Helen's purse, she starts hitting George defensively, he backs off)
This is it?
Alright, Jerry, I'm gonna get my coat.
Ah, ...A beautiful successful intelligent woman's in love with me and I throw it all away. uh oh boy. Now I'll spend the rest of my life living alone. I'll sit in my disgusting little apartment watching basketball games, eating Chinese take out. Walking around with no underwear. Because I'm too lazy to do a laundry.
Oh - comfort, schmomfort. Listen, Father, can I ask you a question? In a terrible time like this...who would I get the death certificate from?
I made him up.
Yeah.
Oh, God.
Yeah, she's very lovely.
Well...maybe not as much as this bastard... (points at Zeke, they all laugh) I can hold my own! (they all continue laughing and drinking)
Will you marry me?
The Rogue's Wallet. That's where he kept his card, his dirty little secret. Short, devious, balding. his name was Costanza. He killed my mother.
My heart! My heart! (To Assistant) Where you going? Are you crazy?!
Chinese food?
No, no, no, see you're not really listening.
Too much salt in my diet.
All right. All right. Let's - let's go over that again.
A few days go by and a call is placed at a time when Sandy is known to be busy at work. Once the initial awkwardness is relieved with a little playful humor, which she [Laura] of course cannot resist, an invitation to a friendly dinner is proffered.
What?
You don't tell him?
I'm not through here, Jerry. (Picks up the model of the conference room.) I'm gonna keep on investigating. This thing is like an onion. The more layers you peel, the more it stinks. (Pam enters, George leaves.)
Shes an... etymologist. You know, bees, flies, gnats. W-What about you?
You're not out there! You can't be, because *I* am out there. And if I see *you* out there, there's not enough voltage in this world to electroshock me back into coherence!
Alright. (Holds them up)
Oh, sports are so pedestrian. I've prepared some science experiments that will illuminate the mind and dazzle the eye.
I'm the opposite of every guy you've ever met.
Volunteer work, huh?
Yeah.
Excuse me, I was waiting here.
...and the Jews steal our money through their Zionist occupied government and use the black man to bring drugs into our oppressed white minority communities.
I wrote. Pfft, *I* wrote.
I insist. Ill fix us a drink. (phone rings  who would that be?) I got it.
I was naked.
Yea, well, maybe some parts.
You guys ever shot anybody?
Next to each other?
Okay, Okay. Who do you think you're talking to? What are ya' you trying to make a joke, because it's not funny. I can tell you that.
Aw, I've just got to say it once, everybody else gets to say it, why can't I say it?
Yeah, he was talking to Marla.
No!
Yeah, of course she did. That's all I ever heard growing up is 'Why can't you be more like Lloyd Braun?' Did you know he was in a mental institution?
Brother Costanza will be taking the vow of silence.
The car!
(thinks for a second) I got used to it.
This is fantastic. Man, what a weekend. Swimming, lobster for dinner...
Yeah, I would. It's just, you know, I just ate a whole pot roast.
What a world that would be, if you just could ask a woman what shes thinkin.
(banging the recorder) Stop it! Stop it!
(as the others are repositioning the tables) No, no, you can't do that, they're round, it makes an 'eight' and, yeah, well alright.
Yeah.
You're Murphy!! Look, let's just jump out of the car.
Uh, let me ask you something. You uh, you ever hear of Marisa Tomei?
(penny drops) Oh, uh, wait a minute, wait a minute. (snorts) Is this about money?
Alright I happen to know what they did last night, they had dinner with Kramer.
Blanket.
Maybe he's, um... mixed.
Hey.
No complaints.
You want me to come back? Uh...
I don't know why I bother even talking to you.
Who gets picked off in softball? Its unheard of.
Huh?
Medical journals!
We discussed toilet paper.
Not now.
Well if she can't tell "six" from "sex" then how is she going to lip read from across the room?
Convulsing?
Really?
A wheelchair? What for?
come on it's just a game.
It's not the money!
Give me two bucks. Ill do it for two bucks.
Divorce is very difficult. Especially on a kid.
My whole life has been a complete waste of time, (chuckle)
(insincerely) Ahh, hey you're home. Hi.
So she's just sitting there, she's having a pleasant conversation... and all of a sudden.
Those are Susan's friends.
I'm writing.
Well, you should always consider podiatry. (Patting Ricky on the shoulder) There's nothing wrong with the feet. (Ricky looks critically back at George)
I know. I can tell. It's one of my powers. Why, did you ever fake?
(to Elaine) You dont tip a gardener!
Very curious.
Well, some of 'em look good. The ones that look good you don't even know about.
Know him? Would you, uh, like to meet him?
Yes, I am.
What, are you locking the door now?
What, you don't want to be you?
Oh, come on! Be sensible.
O.k....(is about to explain. Cut to Jerry on-stage.)
Aahh..No..No..
What, you're gonna take her word over mine? I'm your best friend!
Then... shouldn't you be wearing the bucket.
I got greedy. Flew too close to the sun on wings of pastrami.
Yeah.
Just one? I'm living like twenty. (chuckles) What's yours?
JODI! (he starts running after her)
(In a really strange way) Good, good, do that.
Uh. Cheese, pepperoni, eggplant.
Jerry drinks Morning Thunder?
Kramer, what the hell are you talking about?
Look, we're wasting our time here! We're a half-hour late, they've probably took it off the board already.
(excited) Great news! I showed the pilot to Kramer's Japanese friends. They loved it!
Come on you're... uh... you're fine.
(Again, sarcastic) Oh, what a huge blow to the culture.
Five hundred dollars, that?s a great deal!
Who!!?
Well, don't they make a counter offer? How can they just cancel the whole deal like that? What kind of a maniac is this guy? I mean he just, he says no, and that's it?
Or we could get them together. Woo!
ALL the way, baby!
How engrossing?
Aaaa (looking around for Jerry) aaaa (finds Jerry) Ah ha. They had plans huh? They were busy. They were busy with their (doing a little dance to make the plans seem all that important) big plans!
Oh. It's just horse manure (huh huh - laughs, he points back at the horse that walked by) Horse manure's not that bad. I don't even mind the word manure. You know, it's, it's nure, which is good. and a ma in front of it. MA-NURE. I mean when you consider the other choices, manure is actually pretty refreshing.
(Losing it) Funny guy!
(In a state of hysteria) I'm an eggplant! I'm an eggplant! I'm a minstrel man!
. . . . . . Yeah.
Hey could you do one other thing for me?
It's beautiful. She makes all the plans. I'm not from around here so it's okay if I'm stupid, and she knows I'm only in town visiting so there's no messy breakup
Hmm, what's he doin' in the city today?
When Lupe makes up the beds in the morning.
Oh, nothing...
Yeah. Not only that, this is what she said to me, "Can we change the subject?"
Okay, what are we gonna do?
Thats why, you know, a shake is bad.
So what? Thats good.
Yes, yes. Very smooth, super smooth. No, but I really wanna attack this thing, you know. Sink my teeth into it. So I was just wondering... what do you think would be the very best way to get started?
You can't do that, it's none of your business!
(absently leaving with it) Thanks.
(trying to laugh it off) No, I was just wondering. The information could be relevant.
(slightly worried) You know, I'm starting to get a little nervous about this lunch.
I think this is him right here.
No! Get out of here, Newman.
Abort! Abort!
Defective?!
Good to see you again.
Whew! Anybody see that poster in there? That is weird, wild stuff, huh? Whew!
No, really. No, no, thanks.
Ah, a, You know what, maybe I'll just come ... umm, yummm (stammering)
Ah, you still going on in front of Bania, eh?
I didn't even know it was a job.
Oh, I don't know.
So, how do you like the way I talked you into comin' down here?
What?
Alright, bye.
No no, this is a matter of principle. That would just be saying that anybody could just pull into any parking space any way they want. Well I'm making a stand here. I'm saying *no* to head first parking. I'm not putting up with that. We put up with too much crap in this city, we're not putting up with head first parking.
I suppose I could.
What?
No, not a racial thing, there really is a resemblance...
Excuse me?
Oh, you know what you're like? You're like a pathetic gambler. You're one of those losers in Las Vegas who keeps thinking he's gonna come up with a way to win at blackjack.
A mental institution.
Yeah, look at me. Now I GOTTA FIGURE OUT THE HAT SIZES OF 59,000 DIFFERENT PEOPLE!! WHAT IF A PINHEAD SHOWS UP. I GOTTA BE ON TOP OF THAT.
Might be easier.
Let me digest it. Let me get my money's worth. Y'know what would be good is if there was someone else in the bathroom that could tell me.
I didn't burn it down - Kramer did!
(shamefaced) No.
Hey.
Hey.
Ehh. (nostalgic) Remember that summer at Dairy Queen where I cooled my feet in the soft-serve machine?
Im the judge and the jury, pal. And the verdict is guilty!
I really think I should have been consulted about this.
(Sheepishly to Elaine) I'll be right back. (Leaves)
Kramer! You can't go! Who's gonna do the feats of strength?
He's a wig master
Uh, please, Morty.
Well get it back! It's very important. (winks)
Oh my God, I forgot!
In any other shoe, I lose two inches. I - I can't have a drop down. We were eye to eye, I can't go eye to chin!
(Interrupts) And I still say hes naked under there!
How much was it?
You know what? I should really go talk to her. Nothing confrontational. Just two adults sitting down trying to clear the air. You know, I just know if I could spend some time alone with her. I've got to. (he grabs his jacket) I've got to.
Not everybody knows what the crop circles are. (to the newsstand owner) Do you know what the crop circles are?
Alright, listen, I'll give you your spare keys, but I don't have them with me. Can I please have mine to give to back to Kramer?
(animated) You're letting him have a woman over?!
Jerry! Up here!
I am not buying something just to get change.
I don't know.
What?
Well I spoke to Elaine...
(leaving) Alright that's it for me. Good night everybody.
What?
Ask about you, ask about you.
What are you looking at me like that for?
How was the show?
Uh, here.
Hello.
So you - you really don't have my hat?
I just got fired.
Nothing.
(Getting frustrated) I know.
JERRY! What happened to you?
'Hoochie mama'?
Say good-bye to Koko.
What a movie. Good choice.
How do you kn ow?
(Germanic) Ich bin ein sucker.
Attention Steinbrenner and front-office morons! Your triumphs mean nothing. You all stink. You can sit on it, and rotate! This is George Costanza. I fear no reprisal. Extension five-one-seven-oh.
The Switch?
Well have you got a picture?
Oh, it's a bad day. Uh, you got everyone in your house, you're thinkin', "These are my friends?!"
I think.
Yeah.
So, uh, how long has this been going on?
I have to get in touch with Tatiana! And look at his little outfit. It's all so coordinated, the way his socks matching to his shirt. I really hate this guy.
Allow me. Why?
Wow. Nice.
I can't believe I missed Kramer. You know he asked me to go with him to California.
Yep. There's one liiiittle problem.
(checking his watch) Hey, let's get the check, she's taking the bandages off at four o'clock.
Well, I still don't know what I'm supposed to do. I don't even know what my assignment is.
Ohh, I have tremendous respect for people who work with feet. I mean, to dedicate yourself to the foot - you're toiling in virtual anonymity. I mean..
That was no good?
What about her place?
I can never get the package open in time.
Whadday'mean.?
That's it. That's the line... (squirts mustard into Jerry's coffee and stirs it) ...that destroyed my life.
Ya.
Uuh, sleepy.
Kramer, what are you doing here?
you said "step off"? wow, that is too much hey..huh hey (George turns the cap his wearing backwards like Tony) Tony, I huh, I just had this brainstorm for us. Can you guess what it is?
No problem there. Conformity is an obsession with me.
I guess so.
(confused) What does that mean?
There, there I'm fine.
Why not?
(removing his glasses) You know, Hawaii could be a little tricky right now, there's a lot of high pressure winds down there this time of year, there's a lot of debris constantly flying around. Wood, and uh, lava, pretty dangerous.
Ahh, Excuse me, how much is this?
(energetically) "Well seems it's about time for George's lunch."
What? Why couldn't you think of something?!
When are you going on your next date with her?
Well, I was 14 years old. I was in my friends bathroom. His mother's brassieres were hanging on the shower rod and I picked it up, studied it. I thought, I like this. I didn't know what way or what level, but I knew I wanted to be around brassieres.
Yes! I'm not giving him the satisfaction, it's my space.
Listen, Buck, I uh...obviously I don't need to talk to you about the importance of player morale, but uh...I've been talking to some of the guys, and some of them - I don't want to mention any names - but some of them...they're not too happy with the polyester uniforms.
We'll come up with something.
Well, losing a loved is, uh...I mean, forget about it. (Starts wolfing down the sandwiches.)
(Yelling from the bathroom) Don't tell her anything, she'll kill me!!
Aah! Fire!
Sweep?
Well, what was I supposed to do? Get out of the shower, put on my bathrobe? Go all the way down to the other end? Come all the way back?
(considers, but got into elevator) Won't work.
Yes..
Did you see what just happened?
Did you here that? I can't believe this he's eating his sandwich.
Jerk!
I don't know.
I went to the hardware store interview.
So what happened? She throw you out? Eh?
I've got nothing, I-I-I-I'm blank.
What, to see the old guy?
Care? Forget about care. Love. They have to love the characters. Otherwise, why would they keep tuning in?
No! No.
You know Keith, what I've always wondered, with all these ball clubs flying around all season don't you think there would be a plane crash? ...
Oh, I know.
(quietly) That's uh, for the two of us.
Hey, hey, hey! You don't call me back?!
(taking it out of his jacket pocket) yeah I got some sandwiches.. I got tuna.. and salmon salad Tony because I know you don't like peanut butter
Never thought I'd fail at failing.
That's pretty paranoid.
I knew you had an appointment.
Bear with you! This is a parking lot PEOPLE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO GET
I mean it's hard enough to meet a woman you dislike, much less like.
Oh, hi.. (They shake hands)
If I didnt put that floss in my pocket, Id be crawling around her bedroom right now looking for my glasses.
That's why we're here in America.
Yeah? How?
Well, I just had a fight - I need a group dynamic.
(head down low) I...I wouldn't know"
Who's he?
Siege mentality, Jerry. They really want me out of here. Theyve downgraded me to some sort of a bunker. Im like Hitlers last days here.
Hey, where you going?
(to Jerry) You watch the old videos. (insistent) I'm telling you, look at him.
(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o. (Hes sitting on the floor in his Play Now office).
Nothing.
What about these two? Aren't they gonna chip in?
I am?
Oh, nothing much. You know, I went over to Jerry's. Talked to Jerry. Um, could I talk to you for a minute?
Well, I shouldn't have to pay for it!
Oh! euh.. Yeah We just can't go to the supermarket to get some candy.
Well it was a helluva yada yada.
Leslie.
Hey di ho
Oh, man, it's spinach! I've been walking around like this all afternoon.
(feeling awkward) Its uh, not bad, its comin along. Why? Did you need something.
Look...humm..I'm on with Beijing with the hair restauration clinic. Could you talk to them for me and tell them I'd like to place an order.
Well let me hear....( they struggle for the headphones)
All right, great.
Percentage?
Those were her exact words, I like George.
That woman was unequivocally the worst date of my life.
(upset) But you can't stay here. There's no place to sleep!
Huh, he's a communist. . . . Look at this. "Exciting uninhibited woman seeks forward thinking comrade and appearance not important." . . . Appearance Not Important! This is unbelievable. Finally this is an ideology I can embrace.
You only went in front first 'cause you saw me backing up and you didn't have room to parallel park!
You are?
Yeah, yeah. That's how they talk in the major league. (laughs)
(realizing he was short changed) I was in the pool! I was in the pool!
(Nervous, his voice cracks) Hey, Antonio. How's it going?
Okay, look, Audrey, before you take the bandage off just remember that I was the one that encouraged you to do this, you know? Now that you're gonna be a great beauty, let's not forget how this all began. You know, like if you'd listened to your friend, Elaine,
Yes, it is consistent. I've, uh, I've tried to maintain a consistent feel throughout the house.
We're in Turkey?
Mmm.
I think it moved.
No come on, let me, let me. I smashed your car, it cost you over two thousand dollars,
There's an easy move go from screwin' you behind your back to screwin' you right to your face.
Nose. (chuckles) What's the worst that can happen to a nose? What does it get? Stuffed? (chuckles)
What's the difference? Let's go to Reggies.
(Apprehensively) Um. I just realized. Ya' never gave me back the change from the tolls.
He..He threatened me.
What?
So, Jerry and Nina, huh?
I don't want to! I'm outta money! I got 714 dollars left in the bank.
All right. (smiles behind her back)
(together -- with arms extended -- palms upwards) Stan The Caddy.
Well, thats flattering.
No, of course not. I didnt-
Who's got the receipt?
I'm losin' it!
She's stickin' it to me that she makes more money than me.
Well, there could be.
I don't know.
What do you wanna do?
(Still with a tone) He is. You dont know what Im doin here.
This is amazing. (George gets up to leave and shake's man's hand) Thank you. Thank you very much. . . . I'm going back in! . . . You'll feel better (to woman)
I'm pretty sure I wouldn't.
Well, sure. They're Jewish, and you're a shiksa.
Yeah! Yeah!..Staten Island . What about my clothes ,how do I get the rest of the clothes?
All right. All right. Let's not get into panic mode! Let's not make a big deal outta this thing or we're never gonna get through this night.
I was all primed for the first row; I was gonna put my feet up on the dugout!
I think he was trying to tell me something, like it had some sort of a meaning.
Where's the food? What happened to Ping?
Five' eight. Five' seven.
Please.
Demi (the "i" sounds like an "e")? I thought it was Demi?
What is Tungsten or Wolfram?
Oxygen! I need some oxygen! This is major.
What, you don't like the name?
Oh, sure. Sure, anything. Can you believe it? There's nothing wrong with me.
No, I did not! (They exit the coffee shop.)
And she loved me. Hoo, ho, she really did.
With me or in general?
Well, it always has to be explained to me, and then I have to have someone explain the explanation.
What for?
No no, I never said I was a good driver, I said I was a good parker.
Maybe it was a mouse.
We're perfect. I timed this out so we would pull up at the terminal *exactly* 17 minutes after their flight is supposed to land. That gives them just enough time to get off the plane, pick up their bags and be walking *out* of the terminal as we roll up. I tell you, it's a thing of beauty. I can not express to you the feeling I get from a perfect airport pickup. (starts looking around) What's going on? What are you doing? The Long Island Expressway? What are you getting on the Long Island Expressway for? Do you know what the traffic will be like? This is a suicide mission!
20 bucks? Isn't that excessive?
Elaine, get something! Its all taken care of.
Uh, Elaine, this is, uh, Lloyd.
A bench? What kind of a bench?
So, you live with your mother, huh?
It's alright, I got lunch.
I've always liked her. Remember her in 'Carnal Knowledge'?
I'm a man. Jerry, I'm a man. And do you know why? It's because of that talk we had. You were my inspiration. Do you believe it? You. That lunch was the defining moment of my life.
I like Mike Lubika.
I know it may sound shocking. But, I just can't stop myself from... wanting you.
Hey, by the way, what'd you think of Miss Yoshimura?
All right, all right, I didnt want to tell you this. You wanna know why she called you?
I gotta go help her tape up all his boxes and get them ready for shipping.
The woman she's "lesbianing" with? Susan told me she's *never* been with a guy.
I'd like to sleep with a LOT of other women.
Didn't they notice it?
Oh, this is my friend Jerry.
Oh...uh, because if it had anything at all to do with what you perceived as me leering at your daughter, I really have to take issue with that. I did not leer. (To Jerry) Did I leer?
(gleeful) Hehee. W..we could be like the Gatsbys. Didn't they always like, you know, a bunch of people around, and they were all best friends?
Susan's college roommate.
Because important things go in a case. You got a skull for your brain, a plastic sleeve for your comb, and a wallet for your money.
I'm bad. I'm *bad*!
What did you do?
It's a funny observation.
How'd the Mets do?
Well it's a little strange. You going to start to talk like Elaine from now on?
Happy Festivus!
Watch the arm! Tim, listen, we don't want to bother you, we know you're busy here.
Dad.
I bawled uncontrollably. I just poured my guts out. And I'll tell you, Jerry, it was incredible. I never realized how powerful these tears are. I could have postponed it another five years if I wanted to.
Hey, you know, there's this secretary at work that always had a crush on me.
You're so uptight.
Dont think it cant happen! (Leaves)
They *left* the Junior Mint *in* him?
What? Really?
I think. (Pause as they all look down)
...pianist. A *classical* pianist. She *plays* the piano. She's a *brilliant* woman. I-I-I sat in her living room... She played the *Waldstein Sonata*! The *Waldstein*!
I'll have 'em overnight it.
That's right, of the New York Yankees.
You go in and save seats.
alright alright, I gotta buy some bread
Hey!
All these years I've been chuckin' and you've never told me?
No. Youd be surprised. You dont recover that quickly from a nose job.
He's Keith Hernandez. You're Jerry Seinfeld.
Nah.
I guarantee you that Moses was a picker. You wander throughh the desert for forty years with that dry air. ... You telling me you're not going to have occasion to clean house a little bit.
I knew it. I always felt different.
What?
There's no Gammy.
No! No. It's not good, I don't think so.
Is-is that what I said 'no story'? Because Jerry had to tell me later.
I mean , when I said Hello did she say Hello back?
See ya later.
Two-man? It's all me. Kruger doesn't do anything; Disappears for hours at a time, gives me fake excuses. This afternoon I found him with sleep creases on his face. The only reason I got out to get a bite today was that he finally promised to buckle down and do some actual work. (turning around, George sees Mr. Kruger at a booth eating a piece of cake) Oh, I don't believe this. This is what I have to put up with, Jerry. (He walks over) Mr. Kruger? Who said he was going to do some actual work today? Who?
Did they take anything?
Absolutely...
No?
(after Wendy and to the receptionist) Oh, you have a policy! (to the world at large) The delicate genius has a policy! George heads for the door.
Yea bye.
Guess not.
(melancholy) I wish that was all needed. Life can be so confusing. I..I'm searching for answers, anywhere.
Woo! Courtside! (mock-snide) Is that the best you could do? Ha ha!
Well, I like a rolling writer. They're very smooth.
It's just a magnificent stone. (turns to Jerry) Jerry?
I got it from the Institute. The Institute.
What about me?
No, you wont.
(doing the voice) Im slippery as an eel
What about you and Elaine?
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
Well the guy's just standing there.
Still upset. Very upset.
Wha..? I didn't tell you? I gotta go meet Elaine.
Just because a candy bar fails to fall from its perch
Oh, Safire. Uh ha
What?!
(Staring at the doll) This doll (Pointing) looks like my mother.
Yeah, yeah, not fan talk, not gushing, you know? Actual conversation, I was incredibly articulate!
ALL RIGHT!!
What checks?
Nougat? Please. I think Ive reached the point in my life where I can tell the difference between nougat and cookie. So lets not just say things that we both know are obvious fabrications.
So Scott's your roommate, huh?
The Frogger is here.
For a mental patient. Wait a minute, the phone, we'll call the police.
A bubble boy?
Oh I got it. (TO JERRY) That I'm supposed to remember. Where the car is, that's insignificant.
Yea, ya..ya know I feel terrible about Joey but it's jus..it's a great business opportunity. I-I don't even know how long I'm gonna be away for.
Here. (panicky) We'll leave it here for you!
late June.
You're an alcoholic! You have to apologize. Step Nine! Step Nine.
I can't go in there. Im too uncomfortable.
Yeah.
She got that from you!
Atlantic City? (thinks) Yes! Yes! I will go to Atlantic City. I'm in. I'm down.
'Why don't I rent the movie.' See, this is when I like you. Alright, now I'm relieved. (Kramer enters and comes over to the booth.)
Eh, but, you know, Mr. Ross, if - if you look at the whole situating, what with it being your cigars, and everything, it's really rather ironic - one might even say, in a sense, comical.. (Mr. Ross has, by now, left the room. Mrs. Ross is pointing at George, nodding, laughing. As if to say he hit the bullseye. George calls out to Mr. Ross) Really. Think about it.
What kind of a sick person would do a thing like that?
What's going on?
Ive had my difficulties.
Hi, Elaine.
I was in the middle of a conversation.
..So, one thing lead to another..
Until that stupid photo jogs his memory.
Hello? Amanda. Hi, yes. Listen. You know, I'm thinkin', we might just be better of bein' friends. Yeah. Yeah, you know what, I can't even really talk about it right now. Bye-bye. (hangs up) (happy with himself, but then sees the burned up photo) No! No!
Latex, latex manufacturing
Yeah, and, ... Why won't this go down?
That is what Mr. Steinbrenner wants. He wants, everyone, ta, twirl around.
You won't think I'm a bad person?
More wine and turkey? (Pours Celia more wine)
I can't tell ya now , he's gonna be back in a ten seconds.
So, they go off for the ride, by the time they come back the bread is there.
(With pride) Made it up.
She said no.
That's why they gave you the apartment?
No, but um I have very good report with women, very good, comfortable. And from the first time I laid eyes on a brassieres, I was enthralled.
You're parents saw me on TV?
(horrified) But that meeting starts in ten minutes!
This is a brand new jacket. Boy this really burns me up, ...
Dogs, twists, a kind of fermented chicken drink.
Um, I don't uh, really think I can go.
Boy - I'm really surprised at Elaine - that whole phone business - she should know better than that.
I guess I've been hanging on to them for so long cuz i couldn't accept the fact that Dad was really gone forever (hugs a piece of clothing)
(incredulity) Him you brainwashed! (angry shout) What's he got that I don't have?!
I'm not stealing it. They owe me ten dollars. They stole from me.
Hey, at least I was a camp waiter.
(Interrupting) No!
Ahhh. How does this thing work?
Specific, Ah, lets see. I've walked in and out of so many buildings they all .. blend in together, I uh, ..
Flip it.
You can go crazy trying to figure that place out.
Because? Because?
Elaine said your pretty good at this stuff.
When you're talking about a movie like "Beaches", moving from the chair to the couch , . . . that's quite a voyage.
What?
(on an imaginary microphone) Uh, no, not at this time.
Your girlfriend is doin' your laundry?
You are?
K-I-M-B-R-O-U-G-H
What's the decision?
Wow.
You didn't make it clear.
Oh no, Mr.Steinbrenner, I can explain...
Hu humm? i suppose we could go to Lincoln Center and I'd be wearing sneakers and jeans and that would be fine too.
I just feel terrible This is just terrible.
Well...I was in the locker room showering, and I...I had to go, so...
My dad was a cook during the Korean War. Something very bad happened, ever since you can't get him near a kitchen.
Yeah, what is he? Some sort of an instigator?
Looks like veal.
Why not?
Not that Im aware of, no.
No...Why should that make any difference to you?
You think so?
He-he was uh touching and rubbing. (nervous laugh)
Yes, well, you know, Im not thinking about the price. You know youre the only woman Ive never thought about the price. Get the lobster. I beg you to get the lobster. Go for the lobster.
Could be the leaves...
Look at these salesmen. The only thing these guys fear is the walk-out. No matter what they say, you say, "Ill walk out of here right now!"
Where are all the poetry magazines?
So, you're taking his side?
Oh you told her didn't you.
Okay.
Krama. Please.
That's the genius of it.
No, no no it's not about postponing. I just think the first day of Spring is the perfect day to get married. You know, Spring! Rejuvenation! Rebirth! Everything is blooming all the
Why? Did she say something to you about why she broke up with me?
(excited) You're saying I stand to inherit three hundred thousand dollars, is that what you're saying?!
"These pretzels are making me thirsty!!"
Discovered the Mississippi.
What kind of a sick, demented person wants another person's glasses?
Oh, I can't believe you're dropping out, too. So now Kramer and I have to pay for the entire gift?
20 thousand dollars?
I can't believe what's happening here. She hasn't taken her hands off me all night. She was always friendly around the office, but that was it.
That's right.
We are really late now. We're in big trouble. Big trouble.
Get up, get up, its her! Oh, the hell with this, Im scared to death, just walk away, its off, cancel everything, go!
What about me? I was a total failure. Everything was fine. Now this thing's gonna be a success and God's gonna give me a terminal disease.
Not.
Come on! Come-on.
Those nachos are killing me.
I change I change. Two weeks ago I tried a soft boiled egg. Never liked it before. Now I'm dunkin a piece of toast in there and I'm loving it.
Yeah. No, no, no, wait a minute, I always have tuna on toast. Nothing's ever worked out for me with tuna on toast. I want the complete opposite of on toast. Chicken salad, on rye, un-toasted with a side of potato salad ... and a cup of tea. (laughs)
Ok, ok, fine! It's changed, it's not really the point. Anyway, I'm thinking of making a big move.
Y'know, the funny thing is, somehow I find her more appealing now... It's like if I knew she was a lesbian when we went out, I never would've broken up with her.
Oh, that's nice.
(pleading) Well, my bed is too small.
It's about the show. It... No, it was...
Jerry gargles? Is that why he takes so long?
I don't know, I don't know, you'll think of something.
Alright, now. What mood am I in, what mood am I in?
I guess there are no small diseases, only small actors.
What?
Little baked beans
Yes! Yes! Everybody has to like me. I must be liked!
Yeah. I love Hampton tomatoes. You know, you can eat 'em like apples. You know it's funny, the tomato never really took on as a hand fruit.
You know, it really can't.
Yeah, I saw it.
Well, you got no place to go. I'll tell you what your problem is You brought your queen out too fast. What do you think? She's one of these feminists looking to get out of the house? No, the queen is old fashioned. . Likes to stay home. Cook. Take care of her man. Make sure he feels good.
(calling to Susan) Uh, ah, nothing. Nothing.
if you hadn't come, this whole thing wouldn't have happen (back on Jerry and Elaine's side, we can hear George saying "I was the one who was invited", Jerry opens the door)
Well, me neither.
(Losing it) does not imply transfer of ownership. Moe, Sol, or Lem is not gonna get away with this!
(walking back) Are you sure? 'Cause it could really help me out of a jam.
I really like those sons of bitches.
Is it flowing? I like flowing, cascading hair. Thick lustrous hair is very important to me.
Aw, that's a fun age. (Jerry looks at George distastefully.)
Obviously.
Ah, great, great. (sniffs) What's that smell? Smoke? (walks to the kitchen) Hey everybody, I think I smell some smoke back here...(smoke boils into the doorway.) FIRE! FIRE! Get out of the way!
You like ice?
...meet the Mets. Come on in and greet the Mets.
So we order lunch, and were talking. Finally, she blurts out how its not working.
Hey, maybe I could bribe one of those women that hand out the towels in the powder room.
Nice to meet you.
What?
It's the same menu.
Wait, wait, did you ever see him throw up?!
[sarcastically] Heh heh heh... So side-splittingly funny...
Oh, nothin' much. I went over to jerry's, uh, talked to Jerry.
yeah.. the ambulance got there very quickly
(pleased with himself) You are having problems with your boyfriend and I am meeting you to discuss the situation.
You don't think I can?
Alright, still her father didn't have to throw me out like that, he could have just asked me to leave. The guy had me in a headlock! Susan's not going tonight you know.
No, it's not.
I'll tell you what, if pig-man shows up, we'll squeeze him in. I'll see you later.
Yes, please.
What, you think I could postpone it?
I dont know. But I dont. Im actually almost happy to hear it.
Im not gonna watch you do laundry.
Hup, here we go. Here we go.
Napkins?
It's Mickey Mantle, Jerry. My idol.
So, where you gonna stick this (points to the Fusilli Jerry)
Pick up the phone, Elaine. Pick it up!
Still getting nothing!
Flying him in? How longs he staying for?
He'd just be touching your back too.
Hey, hey! We're discussing something!
(Laughs) Relationship intern...hey, what if two of us teamed up?
You don't know where we parked?
Oh yeah.
You met her a few weeks ago, but...?
He's getting on a bus, damn! (To the blind man) Those are nice glasses.
You want my friend to ask his uncle, a man who just lost his wife of 44 years, for a death certificate so that he can save a few bucks on a flight?
You mean in the end?
It's good, right?
'The lights are much brighter there. You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares, just go...'
But enough about fish, huhuhu. I can discuss other things you know, ah architecture. Huhu. (makes a wide gesture with his arms)
(con't) All right, you know she's got that laugh. What did you say? It's like Elmer Fudd sitting on a juicer?
(shouting) Dee... Deena!
Some sort of electronic thingy.
Keith Hernandez? The baseball player?
(angry shout) So am I!
I dont know, I cant eat. You, you cant have anything anymore. Look at this, look at this. Eggs out. Coffee out. French fries out. BLT out! I go to visit my grandparents three big brisket sandwiches, Im sittin here with a carrot! Theyre closing in on a hundred, Im sayin to them, How can you eat that stuff? (They look at their menus again.) Im so sick about losin that choose, you dont know.
Yeah. Hey, you know, I gotta go get these tomatoes. You wanna go for a ride?
I got scared there for a second. The Knicks without Ewing.
I found it morose. Why dwell on these negative themes?
Lo..k, if you want to taste mine, you don't have to offer me some of yours.
She must have slipped it in here.
Without his shirt on.
And you threw it out the window?
Come on, itll be so much easier.
Hey.
(hitting Cynthia playfully with a napkin) Stop it, stop it.
So, she cant get the apartment.
FDR?
(starts to try to get passed Jerry and Elaine) Alright get out of my way. (Jerry and Elaine push him back, George very annoyed) Alright don't make me get physical here!
The man in the cape--I bet you he is mixed up in this! I don't trust men in capes.
Um, excuse me, I - I think you forgot my bread.
(pointing outside) Why is there a Cadillac parked in front of the house?
Yeah. Thanks. Hey, listen, if you ever get a date, maybe the four of us could go out together sometime.
(panicking) Right, I knew I felt something!
I dunno, Jerry somethin's missing. There's a void, Jerry, there's a void...
That's my whole afternoon! I was going to look for sneakers.
Yeah. So what happened?
I know I gave it to you.
Nine sixty? Give it to me.
Who?
I know. And now they want me to bottle it up. It makes me so mad!
Name tags! Name tags! What kind of an idiot thinks anybody would be interested in an idea like that.
Wax Museum.
(on tape, singing) "Believe it or not, George, isn't at home, please leave a mes-saaage at the beep. I must be out or I'd pick up the pho-one. Where could I be? Believe it or not, I'm not hooome." (beep)
Nah, he didn't have anything to do with it...
Well, maybe not married, but...
Oh, pudding! You want some?
Maybe!.. And I'm moving back in there!
I don't know. He said he wants to be my "key brother."
Oh, Huh, imagine that.
I don't believe it.
Oh, I could do it.
No, no, no Elaine.
I'll tell you what that is - that's a violation of club rules. Now I got him! And you're my witness!
Oh boy..
(talking to nobody) I like horses. Maybe I could be a stable boy.
You could eat of that shotgun.
She kept such a nice clean apartment. She was so sanitary.
a piece?
Im letting you in.
(Rubbing his stomach) Ooh.. Something's not sitting right..
Sure you can.
Excuse me just for a second. ( fixes his hair looking at his reflection in a coffee pot.)
Well, how about that?
Does she walk around holding a pen she never seems to need?
Boy, she is nice. I like her, I like her Jerry. She's got substance. She oozes substance.
No no no, that's in the right position.
Well, we really should be-
hu, Coffee. Too much coffee (nervous laughter).
(coming back in) Alright, alright. Can we go out and eat?
(chuckles) Really? Well, we'll just see about that. Ta-ta, Tut-tle.
How ya doin'?
(looks back to the group) I can read lips. You said let's sleep together.
Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute, don't tell me, don't tell me. It starts with a . . . Duncan Meyers. Oh, wow, this is something. I haven't seen you guys in what, twenty years?
This is not a Metallica concert, it?s an opera alright, a little dignity, a little class, just give me my ticket, I will stand over here and sell it.
(laughs - hehe) Well, first, I'm brushing my teeth and this piece of apple-skin, that must have been lodged in there for days, comes loose.
Oh, no.
Okay, we'll go!
Should we tell him we're leaving?
" I'll always be a winner and you'll always be a loser." This is what he said to me.
Oh, boy. Here she comes.
What am I talking about? Come on. (laughing) You don't think I bought all that? (does a little move)
(tormented) Aw, shut up Jerry! Just shut up!
All right. All right.
Because of society, right?
Frolf, frisbee golf Jerry. Golf with a frisbee. This is gonna be my time. Time to taste the fruits and let the juices drip down my chin. I proclaim this The Summer of George!
He's giving you furniture? Who is this guy?
Just because you have someone's spare keys, it doesn't entitle you to break into their apartment. That's the reason you took away Kramer's keys.
I'm just asking, all they have to do is say no.
These are not "scraps." These are historic remains of a once Great Society of Hair.
(pleading) Elaine, c'mon. Would you just make the call? (indicates the phone) Please, make the call.
What?
Alright. Listen, I gotta get some reading done. You mind if I do this here? I can't concentrate in my apartment.
Art.
(Takes it and throws it out window) Get outta my way!
God.
What is a barometer exactly?
Where was pesto 10 years ago?
So you're a lawyer. What kind of cases do you handle?
How is this effeminate?
Somebody did that?
We came in over there!
Eight o'clock.
You can't break up with me. I've got hand.
She'll open!
Hey, I'm getting in on that.
There was something so reassuring about that cozy little space.
(Definite) I'll take it in my room. (Walks off)
Wow. Excuse me, Miss?
What for?
Ah ha, Ah ha. You would, wouldn't you?
How could you not know who Bozo the Clown is?
I just remembered, th-th-there's this Chinese restaurant out near Yankee Stadium, that puts flyers on all the cars.
No catchin.
Yeah.
(smug) Ah, I guess I showed Neil who's Neil.
I said faddah, I meant Father. Just a little bit nervous.
Yeah for two hours. She's nuts about you.
I'm not kidding, you should do it.
Allright, I gotta head back right away, I'll-Ill -- I gotta figure something out here.
How're the folks?
So what do you care what she thinks.
(Sincerely) Thank you.. I, uh.. that might not work out.
FINE? WHAT SIZE?
They are made from lycra-spandex.
Look, I really appreciate your coming, but if you wouldn't mind - try not to say too much.
Really?
How? Cause Im an Idiot.
Yes, she hates cigarettes.
Was that wrong? Should I have not done that? I tell you I gotta plead ignorance on this thing because if anyone had said anything to me at all when I first started here that that sort of thing was frouned upon, you know, cause I've worked in a lot of offices and I tell you peope do that all the time.
Yeah, right.
What about this--
(taking out wallet) Well, let me. Heh. Let me just eh.. check an', make sure I have the right man--ha! Heh, heh, heh! Seems--oh! I, oh! (has conveniently dropped the photo into her view)
(harassed) Are you aware that I'm being charged for Tuesday's appointment? I had to take my mother to the chiropodist.
(worried) Oh boy.
Told me what?
When you're playing the piano do you think about me?
A lot of people say it.
Always late. Always late.
S, uh, Superman - he, uh, built the fortress of solitude up at the North Pole, to, uh, you know, sort of get away from it all..
I don't have a spare set. All my keys say 'do not duplicate'.
No, listen; we are always sitting here, I am always helping you with your girl problems and you are helping me with my girl problems. Where do we end up?
Ah, Alright, before that, I was in real estate. I quit, because the boss wouldn't let me use his private bathroom. That was it.
(with a mouth full of food) This is good. Oh, this is good.
I was seven and a half.
See, this should be a show. This is the show.
Olive?
An idea.
I know, I know and you know *why* they're moving there?
Do you uh feel the way you feel after the Risotto?
I would like an apology.
No no no, this ones different. This ones a beauty!
(entering Jerry's apartment) Jerry?
Yeah, well, they're my socks!
It's exciting, isn't it? She's gonna have a whole new face.
(George is telling a story. Karen is laughing and she seems to be the only one to find him funny) So I go into this clothing store and the saleswoman is wearing this (whistling) low cut thing. So I said to her "Can I ask you a question? When you put on a top like that, what's your tought process? What's going on in your mind?"
Ya-see, how could this not have any fat? It's too good.
Which market, the, eh, big one, the big market, the big board. Bull market, bear market, you name the market, I'm there.
You know, I think I could have played with dolls if their were dolls in the house. It seems like fun to me. It doesn't seem like a gender thing. I think I would like to play with dolls. What's so terrible?
No, it hit the table, it hit the table.
Oh. (Goes back into the bathroom.)
(scream) Jerry!!
Hi, we're from the United Volunteers, we've come to pick up the TV.
Oh my God. I just remembered where I left my retainer in second grade. I'll see ya. (He throws finished Rubik's cube to Jerry and he exits. Kramer enters)
'When you're alone, and life is making you lonely, you can always go...'
(to Jerry) He collects them.
Are the courses open?
What did you have?
Got it. (the waitress walks away) Did you just see what happened here?
Yes, good for me!
Hey Kramer.
What do you think? The brought it over in pieces and screwed it together like a coffee table?
I know what I'm doin'. In fact Mr. Wilhelm gave me one of those little stress dolls. All right. (gets up) Back to work. (acts annoyed and leaves)
Kramer!
Yeah.
No good?
Hello! All right, we should be going. Come on...
Oh. Oh!
What does it look like Im doing?
Me??
And people come in the store and you get involved in their lives.
Oh, I got it.
(to the cab driver) Excuse me, do you see anything on my lip here?
Where you going? I-I thought I could count on you for a little compassion.
What?
So, you know, she calls and says she wants to go out with you tomorrow night? God bless! Devil you!
Into the hole?
They? The Government?
Hey hey.
I dont know, what were doin here, this is ridiculous.
And in bed--
Nothing.
I can't. He's been on my case about not paying attention. Besides, it's too late, I already told him I heard him.
I can't believe you're hoarding sex moves. I'm out there rubbing two sticks together. You walk around with a zippo.
You thought she was good looking, right?
(pause) Alright if you think it's too much they don't have to mail the postcards.
In every situation. No matter how silly I look. (Tastes his Clams Casino) Hm.. tastes a little funky.
(Showing Jerry up) Listen carefully. My mother has never laughed. Ever. Not a giggle, not a chuckle, not a tee-hee.. never went 'Ha!'
So he explained it all to you?
This is what my life has come to... Tryin to meet a mute.
Well I guess that's because I wear boxer shorts.
So what do you care?
I mean, how funny is this?
(Takes a few seconds to mull this one over. Shooting Jerry a confused look, he repeats it) "The panties your mother laid out for you"? (Jerry nods) What does that mean?
Yeah, you're just so... hip.
I knew this was gonna happen some day. It was inevitable. I've known it ever since I was a little kid. I've been waiting for it.
I calculated my odds of ever getting together with a Portuguese waitress. Mathematically, I had to do it, Jerry.
What, like at a bus stop?
What?!
I don't have a flush.
You can't do that, you can't just sneak in from the back like that.
How much money d'you think they have?
I like DeSoto.
What! There's no signs here! This is an outrage!
She knew I didnt have a job, she knew I lived at home. Didnt seem to bother her. I think I could have married this woman.
What, I'm puttin' my shirt back on.
Listen Sheila it's not what you think. I put my trust into the wrong person. He said the key word was tasteful.
Deena! Deena, wait a... Deena, help!
(Nervous) Nothing.
Well, I think Poppie's got some problems. There's a whole other thing going on with Poppie. So how did you leave it?
You were supposed to deliver my calzones. We had a deal!
I'm Colin O'Brien.
(Snapping) Is that important, really? What is this, a police investigation? The woman's been through enough. She has to relive the experience now?!
Yes, she wants me to like her, if she likes me. But she doesnt like me!
Ahh! How'd she look?
What are you up to now, uh, Step Nine?
We did?
It's like, all dented.
No.
No problem.
Well, if it doesn't concern me, then I can stay. (Kramer grabs the back of George's chair, drags him out into the hallway and closes the door.)
This is just what I need.
She um, she wants to see The Muted Heart.
You know, this is very nice, but I really could take a cab. Really.
Stay back! (Runs out of the room, pushing Jerry out ahead of him)
Yeah, yeah, the flower guy. Listen, I know this all sounds a little crazy, but...
Hey, frolf?
Yup.
Do you know the last time I wore this thing? Six years ago, when I made that toast at Bobby Leighton's wedding.
(waving Eva.
(taking the phone from Elaine) Jerry, why is Elaine getting your mail?
No, you're gonna sit down, you son of a gun...
Yeah, well, he probably bought it.
Oh, great guy.
Ma?!
All right. That's enough for today. You're tired. Get some sleep. I'll see you first thing in the morning.
Laundry? Dry cleaning?
By the way, how did Puddy get back in the picture?
What was that all about?
Why couldn't you squeeze one of those stupid rubber balls to get your stress out? Why did you have to destroy *twenty-five* computers?
Just take the cap off.
I've said that before?
I loved her Jerry, I loved her.
Chamberlind, you could hold his head in nthe toilet, he'd still give you half of Europe.
Vivian!!
Well, I do what I can. (Robin comes over.)
Boy! What a story! I'm speechless. Speechless. I have no speech.
They were drinking champaign in a buggy!
I didn't even know Fulton was in the hospital.
Yeah, right.
Nnnnnnngaaa!
(Long pause) ..Felt like it. I tell you, this doll is pretty spooky. (Takes off his glasses, rubbing his eye) It's freakin' me out man. And now I got to go back out there and pick up this doormat.
WAIT ,WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!!!!.... Where was the tape recorder?
So what, what is so bad about that?
(singing as he exits florist with bouquet and a cup of coffee) "...tootsie, good-bye. Too-too, tootsie..." (takes a drink, makes a face, shouts back at shop) You call this coffee? (dumps out coffee behind him, accidentally hitting a parked car's windshield)
(Once again, still on the shower) Could it be lukewarm?
I've never seen a big salad.
It's the real deal.
You look like you're five years old.
So... Can I have it?
Ooooo, I'm scared. . . . Ohoooo they're not going to do the show.
Never.
I guess I should be, but Im not.
Playground equipment.
All right, so are you ready, so we'll go out and get something to eat.
Well, it's . . . much too low.
(on tape, singing) "Believe it or not, George, isn't at home, please leave a mes-saaage at the beep. I must be out or I'd pick up the pho-one. Where could I be? Believe it or not, I'm not hooome." (beep)
(Gestures for Kramer to shut up) Once again, Antonio, I can't even begin to say how deeply, deeply sorry I am about everything. The job, the cat.. (A lamp breaks) the lamp.
Oh... (George looks around and sees the chef hiding behind a plant it's Bob!)
'Mickey'? (incredulous) 'Mickey'!
Flame on!
No, she left. Listen, you can't mention any of this to Elaine. Cynthia will kill me, we made a deal.
I looked up. I couldn't believe it.
What?
She never came back from lunch.
What are those?
...and, and maybe shell see me when she gets there, does this woman intend to spend time with me?
My mother loves Hampton tomatoes. She's nuts for Hampton tomatoes.
I uh got the first name.
You, uh, you like baseball? [picks up baseball from desk]
Yeah, thanks.
My *father* is gay...
Yes. Significant shrinkage.
Everybody likes pesto. You walk into a restaurant, that's all you hear - pesto, pesto, pesto.
Ha Ho! (he turns and walks out the door)
All right, that's enough. I gotta go home and take a nap.
What?
Find a job. Get an apartment.
Hi. I'm ah, I'm here to see a Mr. Art Vandelay..
So did you enjoy your lunch?
Well nothing. I didn't actually say that. (Karen is still laughing)
Its a great thrill to meet you, Sir.
(on intercom) It's George.
You are gonna love this car. Even if you don't like Jon Voight.
Alright, you're in for one-fifty.
Did she do it on purpose?
(anger) Well now it's not gonna be original! It's gonna lose all its cachet!
(pulls a face) I find it disorienting. Who buys an umbrella anyway? Y..you get 'em for free in the coffee shop in the metal cans.
(indicating the window) Kramer, it's, it's raining. They got the tarp on the field.
Where's the luck? There's no luck. 1,900 dollars down the drain.
Oh my God, its exactly the same!
'Cause believe me, I would only say this to you and maybe a psychiatrist, maybe. Well, her nose is a little big.
Stopped dead.
What about the regards?
For that rent, shed take a bath in the toilet tank if she had to.
Oh, oh!
You know, Einstein wore the exact same outfit every day.
Of course it is.
Sorry we're late.
What if she becomes Miss America? You could be dating Miss America, Jerry!
I cant call her now. Its too soon. Im planning a Wednesday call.
Oh, Noooo, I'm so sorry. It's the MOOPS. The correct answer is, The MOOPS.
Like a "Hey your mother is uglier than Hazel. Hazel really puts your mother to shame"
Elaine.
(Interrupting) Jerry, No!
Well why don't you get a hold of it and change what you don't like.
Oh, I wanted to talk to you--I'm sorry, I--didn't know you... (re Donna) had company. (Jerry indicates he should stay) Hiya, I'm George.
Why don't you just ask him?
...especially a girl. Or a boy.
A ha! We're just friends.
(defensive) So what? So what if I do?
I solve problems. That's just what I do.
What $98.00?
Good, let her think it.
KHAN!
(gesturing with flyer) With Spartacus?
Yeah, me too...
You see?.. You see?!
No, no...
(Laughs as they leave) It's working already! (Both exit)
Oh I would love that. You think he'd really do it?
Why not?
Was my father wearing a cape?
(downcast) Yeah, too bad. Too bad.
You think she's happy?
Be right with you. Look Mr. Steinbrenner.
Clara Barton? What did she do?
Right.
Then I see my clothes floating out there. The tied took them out, not the kids.
Ok, what did you say?
This is a guy I know.. Kramer.
Pounded?
Oh, no, Sir. Festivus is all too real. And.. I could prove it - if I had to.
That's what I'm afraid of. You know Mr. Steinbrenner, . . .
(snorts) C'mon.
I dont know why you even bother with this ping pong guy, Ill tell you that.
Yes.
Dont you think you get more without it?
Jerry! (Slams the door) Georgie's moving out!
No, he said there was nothing he could do, and next time I should probably break the Prozacs in half.
Payroll!!
Oh, every chance I get.
Drakes?
Sweet Fancy Moses!
Oh, you know, Lloyd, I really don't have it.
Yes.
I'm gonna do it.
That's him over there. The one that looks like a blowfish.
I don't even like to sit next to a man on an airplane 'cause our knees might touch.
Well I just got back from swimming in the pool. And the water was cold...
I think I can still catch her.
Hey, Jerry, what was the name of the exterminator who fumigated your apartment when you had fleas?
She had an itch. She could have used any one of those fingers. That finger was meant for me.
Yeah. Right.
Oh. What is this?
Ahh, Ah-AhWe had a deal!
Women like skiers.
I still don't understand this. Abby has a mentor?
What are you comparing yourself to Keith Hernandez. The guys a baseball player Jerry, Baseball!
Uh... hey. I'm gonna get going.
Na, he's gone. I wonder what happened to him.
To the hospital.
Why you going home for?
That's like using a wheelchair for the fun of it!
Oh, I, uh--
Yeah. Let's go.
So, I've got ice cream all over my face. There were no napkins there. Whoever it was that's responsible for stocking that concession stand cost me a relationship.
You mean a blessing in disguise?
All right, do you mind? I have the window! (To Willie) Now, what are you gonna do about my Twix?
You might want to try it...makes the movie more enjoyable, that's all.
What do you mean, oh no.
I'm not going to see that nut doctor she went to Europe with.
The whole hour just flew by. (laughs - hehe) (Begins cleaning up the table.)
Hi Allison, thats a nice dress.
No, Kramer. I have to have this statue.
I cant. I met them. Theyre devout. You know, in the cab on the way over here, I actually thought about converting.
Great move, telling him, by the way, real smart move.
She just dislikes me so much... It's irresistable.
A biopsy?
It's "Guys And *Dolls*", not "Guys And *Guys*".
Seemingly. Seemingly. But within that basic framework there are many subtle variations, only discernable to an acute observer, that reflect the many moods, the many shades, the many sides of George Costanza.
Hey, use mine. Ill let you in.
No, I'm a friend of Elaine Benes.
I lost it.
Hey, did you know that the Yankees don't wear cotton jerseys?
I've had bedroom naked, I've had walk-to-the-bathroom naked... I have never had living-room naked.
Maybe a black.
??? KNOCK OFFS. I NOT GOING TO DO IT! AND YOU'RE GOING TO CALL STEINBRENNER BACK AND CANCEL THE WHOLE THING.
(George takes out the suit from the other rack) Well, look at this. (innocently) This doesn't belong here! Someone has made a terrible mistake.
Yes, full. I love to be full ... love to sit back, loosen the old belt and digest away for hours. Let those enzymes do their work.
I like this area. I could live out here.
What's so funny?
Don't be silly.
An ostrich burger.
What exactly is mutton?
Oh, Hi, I'm George. (they shake hands)
I didn't say I was Ted Danson.
yeah!
Every night at six-thirty. The nurse was gorgeous.. then I got a look at the patient.. (Laughs, then snorts) I was going nuts.
Well take a look. It might not even belong to her.
I dont know whatcha had to tell her that for. You put me in a very difficult position, Marine Biologist! I'm very uncomfortable with this whole thing.
Hope he's not the guy.
I'll tell you what, why don't you read this book and let's just see if you can explain it to me.
Payroll? No, no, I haven't done that.
What are you, Crazy? I can't ask the guy for more cigars after you burned down his cabin!
Yeah, yeah. I've heard that. Meanwhile I'm here with you in a parking garage, what am I supposed to do?
Jerry! I need you to get another picture of man-hands. I'm beggin' you!
You do know Kramer?
Oh, ok. Thank you. It was good talking to you.
Should I apologize to Woody?
It'll take to long.
Yeahaha, I gave it a shot (pats Jerry on the arm)... So, any word on the "artiste"? (puts a video in the VCR)
Hum..( to Elaine) Hey! did you talk to Paula?
What? I work here.
You know, I'm sorry, I...I hate to be one of those people, but we're right in the middle of this thing...I can't hear.
Theyre my books.
What, have you completely lost your mind?
When are they leaving for Paris?
Seven!!
No no no, I got it.
He said he didn't care. Oh, God I love that place. Hey, have you seen other dermatologist?
Shouldn't we at least drop off your bag?
Whatever. (George looks to the table) Hey new tape recorder?
If youre having second thoughts, if you didnt want it, dont worry about it because uh, you know, I, I...I could take it, you know.
Oh, get outta here.
(pauses) A marine biologist?
Really!
And, um, it was quite good. In fact, you even incorporated me into the show. I'm not actually a performer. Although, my parents felt I had talent..
Of course! Alright, maybe I'll say something to Buck.
Nevertheless.. I was wondering if you and your .friends are doing business here at the Jiffy Park.... You know ..hum What do you people call it? Turning tricks? Anyway I...I....found a condom in my car....and I'm not saying it's yours but.... I want to know if I should just change parking lots.
" That guy was amazing, he could dunk and he was my height...What was his name again?"
You remember the woman on the horse? She wanted my spot.
So, the college cancelled the gig?
I don't know if you're ready for it.
What about personality?
A biopsy!
I should probably get going too. If I don't feed Pequita by seven, she goes all over everything.. take it easy.
Well, he is. I, uh, I live around the corner.
This you are not going to believe. Al Netchie, that pimple. Tells Daphne, not get this 'Not to get involved with me.'
Start what?
It's funny! (To Elaine) and it wouldn't kill you to not be so funny either.
I'm wearin' a little hat, I'm jumpin' through fire.. They're puttin' their little alien heads in my mouth..
I can't go out there, he knows we're friends.
Ma, people can hear you.
(Resenting the fact. Nodding) I am aware.
He said he didn't know what it was.
I think he's saying 'Son of Sam'! Oh, my God!
Come on over and sit down.
Well, thank you for your support.
Hey. (pointing at him) Corbin Bernsen.
I had the perfect situation here, he was shouldering half the load.
Look, we're not gonna be that long anyway... we have to get to the "party"!
She had a dude?
(ON PHONE) It's a '76 Chevy Impala. They stole it right in front of the hospital. I saw the guy drive off in it. Well he's about five feet tall, hairless, pink complexion.. (Elaine puts her finger on her nose) looks like a pig. Yeah, alright alright, thank you, thank you. (Kramer enters) So any word from the "pig-man"?
(on tape, lifeless) Hey, it's George. I got nothin' to say... (beep)
(As the Twix starts to move) Ha, ha, ha, ha! (The Twix gets stuck in the spindle right before falling. George begins to pound the machine) Come on! Jump!
I haven't even met the fiancee! Whatever! (Leaves for washroom)
(through a mouthful of shrimp) Well, why don't we just put a monitor in his skybox?
Nice to meet you.
(Drawing attention back to him) Excuse me!
You wanted a Yankee, I got you a Yankee.
They should call it round tine. You know what I'm talking about.
Elaine, shes a psychic. She knows how the kids going to be.
How could it still smell after all that?
You want to hear more? The master bedroom opens into the solarium.
"George would never do anything like that."
(to Elaine) He asked you to get the mail?
I'm interested.
Jerry? Why?
Hm?
(on the answering machine) Jerry, it's George. Hey, hey are you all set for the weekend. This is going to be great. You're going to have a great time with Naomi.
No.
Oh my god.
No, no, no potato man. Inka-dink.
Oh, so now I have to buy this whole chair by myself?
. . . gone?
Yeah. Why, what do you do?
(on phone, as Jerry gestures beside him) No, Lindsay, it was not IN the garbage. It was above the garbage. Hovering. Like an angel. Of course I know your aunt bit it. I kissed her goodbye. Listen, can I tell you something else? In my family, we used to eat out of the garbage all the time. (Jerry makes a face) It was no big thing. That's right. Oh, okay. Buh-bye. (hangs up phone) I'm back in, she gave me a second chance.
I've been doing a lot of thinking. This might be my chance to start giving something back.
Thanks a lot. Ill give it back to you in a week.
Do you swear?
I sold your clothes yesterday.
(opening door to leave) He picked her up?
What mail?
(after hesitating, resignedly) All right. (He sits down and smiles unconvincingly at her)
You're blown?
Well I can't break up with her now.
Whatever.
Yes, but I still don't feel right about letting you into Kramer's apartment without his permission.
You're out?
You're cuttin' me loose?
I-I wasn't in the attic.
(shouts) Marisa Tomei!
How do you know?
Well, I guess these would be out of the question. (pulls out two pudding skins in plastic bags.)
No! No!
Finished your thought.
Yeah, I think I got a touch of something, too.
Really? I thought you liked her.
Well, aren't you the boss of him? You shouldn't let him move up! When I was in the Cub Scouts, I got stuck on Weebolos for three years 'cause I kept losing the Pinewood Derby.
No, I got my own place.
It's my space!
Do I smell?
You don't understand. He's got this big party coming up. He's been looking forward to this for months. This is gonna destroy the whole thing.
I'm not going to break a hundred on this thing.
Alright, tell her. Go ahead.
You see that woman on the horse? (points)
I told you, he probably went out the back.
What? Rate-aholics?
Oh good.
Cops. I don't even care about cops. I wanna see more garbage men. It's much more important. All I wanna see are garbage trucks, garbage cans and garbage men. You're never gonna stop crime, we should at least be clean.
Really? I thought you and Celia were sleeping together?
Coming up.
I was personable. Don't you think I was personable?
I understand you offer a 50%-off 'bereavement' fare...?
Cause its all in the greeting.
All he has to do now is count his blessings, say a prayer, and he's done. Do you believe this?
Ya. That's what she told me.
Ya it used to be right in the middle of single Jeopardy and now they do it right after single Jeopardy.
Just put it on! All right now, remember she had her nails done today so remark how you like the color. And if you need me you beep me, all right. Here you go, hey, hey, hey, hey...(sprays Binaca into Jerry's mouth.) Go get'em you're a tiger!
Yes, well, I sat down with Mr. Steinbrenner. I told him you have been doing great work. I said that you deserved a raise, and if you didnt get it, that I, was leaving. (motions with both arms in a circular motion to his right)
Hey, what goes on there, exactly?
Can I go like this?
(casually) Sure, why not.
You be nice! He's giving me a parking space (echoes) parking space... parking space...
Well, well, well.
Oh my God, I forgot to tell you. I got a letter today from the State Controller's Office. Y'know when I was going to public school back in Brooklyn, every week I used to put fifty cents in the Lincoln Savings Bank.
My credit card?
No, I don't have any change. I never carry change.
Jerry?
What? No dibs! I need this statue. Cmon, give it!
The place went nuts.
I, I couldn't help but notice that uh you don't have a chair.
What?
Just tell her whatcha want, they'll make it for ya.
Personal matter.
Parking in a handicap spot. Right in the middle of his United Volunteers meeting. When he got back, he chased after me with a baseball bat.
Now, if this mechanic guy, was, in fact, eating a 5th Avenue bar, as he claims, wouldnt you agree he would have no problem picking one out from a candy line-up?
I think that's one of mine.
A dry-cleaning bill?
I know, I know. Kind of a cute Nazi though.
"The hell with them?"
So you're gonna let me get suspended for shower urination?
There's gotta be more to life than this. What gives you pleasure?
I don't chew gum.
Do women know about shrinkage?
It's like a magic trick. Sometimes I think it would be easier to bend a spoon mentally than to make that transformation.
Hawaii?
We did a crossword puzzle together, *in bed*. It was the most fun I ever had in my entire life. Did you hear me? in my *life*! Y'know?
No, not Lloyd Braun. But the cashier.
Great. Jerry, I gotta tell you, I had the BEST TIME with that Nina last night. I - I think I'm in love with her already. You are a great friend. (Hugs Jerry) A great, great friend.
The song?
Well, I was wondering...
You know, my mother used to walk around on our apartment just in her bra and panties. She didn't look anything like you, she was really disgusting, really bad body. If you could imagine uglier and fatter version of Shirley Booth. Remember Shirley Booth from Hazel. Really embarrassing, cause you know I had only mother in the whole neighborhood who was worse looking than Hazel. Imagine the taunts I would hear.
"Argh!!..Anyway...Jimmy couldn't be here today so he asked me to fill in for him, and I'm sure that you'll be impressed at what can be accomplished after only a few short days of training.....yeah!"
(to Claire) Now, a woman calls me, all right?
(noticing something) Hey look, a dime.
How 'ya feelin'?
I said, would you like to go for a walk or something.
Are you gonna move the car?
Where did this come from all of a sudden?
What?
So now you're doing my bits?
Oh, she's a Kramer. And uh, while I was there I uh happened to pick up another juicy little nugget about our friend.
What? Oh, My God!
Yeah.
Yeah, much better. All right, so what's the move, because I need *something*. This woman I'm dating, it's like she's doing her nails during love-making.
If you're bleak, you're bleak.
Your clothes smell just like Pisano's. There's another Italian place on Jerome. Maybe I can fool him.
She's like a district attorney. If it's not the truth, I'll break under the cross. I actually have to do it.
I'm gonna slip him a mickey.
Pass the salt please.
I don't know. (TO ELAINE) Where's Kramer?
They wanna have another meeting? They wanna buy it?! They wanna but it?! Oh! I tell you! We're gonna be rich!! What are we gonna get for this? Fifty, sixty thousand?
(back-pedalling) No, he, he didnt actually tell me that, uh, we were talking about that commercial  in fact I think I brought it up because I like that commercial. No, he, he would never tell me anything. He never discusses anything. Hes, hes like a clam. Youre not gonna mention this, to him...
Yeah, I know what happened.
What the hell.
You know, I think we really need to be in front of a television set. You take T.V. out of this relationship, it is *just* torture.
But now I have my own market research. Actual Japanese viewers, that love the show! I'm gonna talk to Kramer.
I still don't see why you wouldn't eat me. I'm your best friend.
Really? You like it? I got it at a flea market today.
The Bubble Boy!
Why is what I do is so important? Why must I be always the focal point of attention? Let me just be, let me live.
And it's their anniversary Friday night. I could send them for a hansom cab ride. Y -- you think they'd like that?
Yeah. I don't think they'll be able to tell.
We...must never ever speak of this again..
Why'd I think it was timbre? Yeah, she could do voiceover commercials, why didn't you tell me about her voice?
It's my father's car!
I don't want Morgan's job. He's got a lot of work to do. Hey, Elaine, your friend never woke up Mr. Morgan.
Aha. Aha. Could it be because you don't want him to know that you have a friend who pees in the shower, is that it?!
(triumph) Alright.
I don't know.
Nooooooo......
You know they used to make leisure suits out of this fabric?
Take toilet paper for example. Do you realize that toilet paper has not changed in my lifetime? It's just paper on a cardboard roll, that's it. And in ten thousand years, it will still be exactly the same because really, what else can they do?
I already bought it! I've been lyin' to you for three days, and now you're all screwin' me!
What?!
Well, I'm not buying it. No way. Forget it. No way I'm buying this! (beat) I mean, look at it! What is it? It's a bunch of squiggly lines! (beat) Are you telling me you couldn't paint this?
Well, they gave birth to me, and, yada yada...
There was no meeting. (gets one of the folding chairs) But it was quite a meeting. You are looking at the next director of Mets scouting. The only thing is, I have to get fired from the Yankees first.
Ah, excuse me, Vice-president Coco, no one cares about your Gammy.
Oh, come on! You gotta get me over there!
Bye-bye.
Hey, hey.
It's dismissive.
I didnt think ahead.
Hey! Wow, the K-Man! (They walk into the kitchen inside)
You have a car?
Nah, with crutches it's a funny story, with a cane it's a sad story. You through with those?
It - it's just that I'm here with my parents, and my mother wants me to take a civil service test - and to tell you the truth, I don't even think I'd pass it.. So..
Oh, that's me.
...and then when I saw the photo I remembered where I'd seen him; the boom box incident.
C'mon, you took my seat.
You spoke to my mother?
"throws your hips off kilter" So where's your money? (pulls out his wallet)
...And exporter.
You already got it.
You're giving me the "it's not you, it's me" routine? I invented "it's not you, it's me". Nobody tells me it's them not me, if it's anybody it's me.
145!
He's older, completely covered in filth, no whistle, but I think it's him.
Yeah. Yeah. It's the only way. Come on. What are you, kidding me?
What's with all these flags?
Uh...no.
She doesn't.
So I saw that new movie about the Hindenburg.
Eighteen dollars.
Right.
I had no Idea you were filled with such....sexuality..
That's what nuns and Red Cross workers are for.
Me, uh, uh, no, ...
I don't know, I like stuff you don't have to think about too much.
Your parents are going to Paris right?
My parents don't read! They're gonna wonder what a book is doing on the table!
Well, Dr, Allenwood, uh...I was hoping to compile an - admittedly, rudimentary - scrapbook of her life. Something that Betsy could have, and hold onto.
I'm a bad man!
Are you kidding? People get spaces this good, they never give em up.
Alright. Uh, well, I'm out of here. (Gets up to leave)
Aw c'mon.
And so, for all these reasons, we are officially broken up. (shuts book and reaches for door) Thank you, (opens door) and good night.
What, is he crazy?
What about that spot I got?
(jokingly) You are still paying for this lunch?
I wouldnt think so.
And the underwater bubble cities?
(Frantically) Jerry, Jerry?
Well do you want me to take it off?
You see, my friend here, his aunt passed away last night.
Yeah, yeah.
No I didn't!
Well Kramer's not an usher anymore.
Monica wants me to wear it.
Only I hold the answer key to their true candy identities. And so, without further ado, I give you the candy line-up. (Opens a door to a back room. Various dealership employees are munching on candy bars)
(getting annoyed) Hang on, it's warming up!
Yeah, but they let me go on and on all about the Hamptons, they never said a thing! You don't let somebody lie when they know you're lying. You call them a liar!
Ah, ah, twenty to three.
Then of course with evolution, the octopus lost the nostrils and took on the more familiar look that we know today.
I love the mirror in that bathroom! I dont know what in the hell it is. I look terrific in that mirror. (George sits.) I dont know if its the tile or the lighting... I feel like Robert Wagner.
"The phone's a piece of junk, goodbye"!
I swear, I swear!
Whoa, look at this. This is a beautiful suit. Huh?
Alright, fine.I'll drive the 3 hours each way, 6 hours all together, and take 'em off myself!!
Yes yes yes This is unbelievable.
85, Jerry! 85 IQ !
(animated) It failed here! Because, here, every time you turn on a TV, all you see is four morons sitting round an apartment, whining about their dates!
Jerry? Yes, I suppose he is white. You know, I never really thought about it. I don't see people in terms of color. You know, there's someone I'd like you to meet. Hand on... (To phone) Is Mr. Morgan in?
He he...So huh! What's with the suitcase.
Well George . . . .
You see? Now that is a handsome man. (Elaine and Jerry look right at George) Oh please.
Who?
Yeah, hell be looking at us like hes backstage at a puppet show.
Well, sure Joey, sure, I would be thrilled.
Better than before?
What are you, Bud Abbott? What are you callin me an idiot?
Howbout sports? Do you follow sports?
You think this is the plane that Ted Danson gets?
The nice one that works in my office.
Oh, nothin' much, . . . talkin'. . . . Oh, oh, oh, did I have an unbelievable idea today!
Water. Need some water! Water here!
Where? (He looks out window and gets hit by a tomato)
I've tried. We don't have it. But maybe the two of us, working together at full capacity, could do the job of one normal man.
We gotta get something. I don't want to go to that meeting on an empty stomach. Let's get some Chinese. You wanna order it?
You heard it fifty times already.
(double takes) What's that?
This is totally different! That was my secret, this is Jerry's secret! There's...there's attorney-client priveleges here! If I play it by your rule, no one'll ever confide in me again, I'll be cut out of the loop!
Okay, go ahead.
What am I supposed to get, a bazooka?
Smile.
It's a bit hilly - no?
Oh I beg to differ. My father took great pride in his appearance, he was a very handsome man, a casanova really.
What, you know Kramer?!
Sorry? Why sorry? What you got to be sorry about?
Maybe she moved it up in the rotation.
Hey check this out. I go to pick up my pictures and she says " I hope you got that mustard stain out of your shirt."
So eh, you eh, wanna get together tomorrow?
I'll try some on and see how they look. It's just hair.
Hey, I brought you some cigarettes. You buy yourself something nice.
I don't know her.
I can do this, Jerry.
Out. (Jerry shakes his head in agreement) Wow. I spend so much time trying to get their clothes off, I never thought of taking mine off. (Jerry nods; George looks at his watch) Alright, Hey come on, get out of here, Dophne gonna be here any minute.
uh uh, we're uh ..
Should I give you my keys, is that the transaction, trading keys...? Because Elaine has my keys.
Would it kill him to check up on us? No - drops off the meals and that's it. I realize we're prisoners, but we're still entitled to catsup.
Yeah. Got to invite The Drake. Listen hem...there's something that's been on my mind and we haven't really talked about it..I t's kind of important to me.
I'm not! I'm inside the walls!
On an elevator? You met a woman on an elevator?
No. Autonomy, complete and total autonomy.
(after waitress walks away) I don't believe it, she did it again!
You gotta look at this. I pulled it in perfectly equidistant from the car in front of me and the car behind me.
Wait a minute, Rinitze? Don't they have somme really cool suits in there?
(crestfallen) But you said it was my call.
You're gonna rip it. You're gonna rip it.
We could build a cabin like (Snaps) that.
yeah, Kramer, we're, uh, kind of in the middle of something here. We're trying to do a little work..
You want me to ask one of the Yankees.
Why? Is there anything wrong?
No. During.
Absolutely. Because instead of doing a wash, I just keep buying underwear. My goal is to have over three hundred and sixty pair. That way, I only have to do wash once a year.
Sorry I'm late.
I'm not going back in there.
Thanks Mike. Nice to be aboard.
Ye - yeah. And we had a pact, you know.
I did, I'm trying to call China.
They have no friends.
What are you kidding? We look great! You know what this pudding needs? The skin on the top, you know like your mother used to make it on the stove.
They're making their decision today.
(As he leaves) One would hope.
Well, sorry I missed that, uh, charity thing. But this was one of those truly glorious Hampton weekends that you always hear about.
Seven-eight-four.
Got her machine. Im dead, Im a dead man. Thats it. Im dead, Im a dead man. Dead man.
(after a moment's thought) Art Vandelay.
So what did she say?
Ah, well, you know we gotta been running because of the ...
Hi, I was just uh... I just had one little question about uh, my assignment.
Still a little summer left.
Hey.
She knows that I have her clock. I know that she has my hat. I think she's getting ready to make an exchange.
I don't see how I could perform sexually in a situation after something like that. I was completely emasculated. Anyway, it's not the only reason.
I don't even know what they think. That's why I'm in therapy.
(To himself) How am I gonna do this? I'm engaged to this woman? She doesn't even like me. Change the subject? Toilets were the subject. We don't even share the same interests.
Whose are these?
Wait, wait a second, what are you doing?
What'd you do today, dad?
This is unprecedented!
Hey, you're hurting me!
Oh, well, uh. Gary told me you said hi.
What are you repeating everything I'm saying?
Well, if it's as good as ``Ponce de Leon'', I'll be happy.
I went to look in the mirror, it wasn't there. You threw off my equilibrium.
I, I, I can't.
What does that mean?
(smiling) Ho ho. Funny. Isn't he funny? Funny guy. Ha ha ha.
(depressed) Feel like I can't do anything wrong.
I'm the assistant to the travelling secretary. I'm going on the road trips with 'em! I'll be on the plane... I'm working in Yankee Stadium! This is a dream, I'm busting, Jerry, I'm busting!
That's Kramer.
What difference does it make what she looks like?
You're incredible.
Hey hey hey, check me out, huh?
(Depressed) Well,.. the Andrea Doria.. that was quite a fire. (Moves to the door, leaving)
Well, what happened when you got upstairs?
Oh, yeah.
yeah....euh...I dunno What?
I've done the march in. Best feeling in the world.
All right! All right. I'll tell you what. How about this? Got the date; March 21st, the first day of spring.
Nothing at all.
Wait till you hear this! (George sees Donna and no Jerry.) Whoa, ah, Im sorry, I didnt, I had no idea.
Now, listen closely. I was at the unemployment office and I told them that I was very close to getting a job with Vandelay Industries and I gave them your phone number. So, when now when the phone rings you've got to answer "Vandelay Industries".
(Fake sympathy) Well, my mother, Jerry..
I can't believe this! What was wrong with it? What didn't you like about it?
Eh...come oooon...(starts stabbing the paper with the pen. Mr. Wilhelm comes in)
Gimme a half-hour.
I'm very nervous about this. I've never spoken to a mental patient before.
Well, what should I do, Kramer?
(puzzled) W-we're not?
Well, I feel better already. I'm feelin' like a good person.
I..I..I dunno.
Yeah, You remember the, the little eh, bank book, there?
Jerry Lewis?
Who's going to bomb you. An airline for all the stupid little peanut jokes.
I dont like to discuss figures.
Hello, Ken. It's George Costanza. I think we need to talk.
What, are you kidding? (Points at the flaws of Jerry's hands) The knuckles are all out of proportion. you got hair over there - where do you get off comparing your hands to my hands?! This is a one-in-a-million hand. (Points to his own hand)
What?
I hope I am.
All this in 5 days. Hmm.
That's the sign! The test; if a - if a man makes it move.
What, a 'little' cologne.
This could have been a huge mistake.
All right. All right! I'll go.
I'm wearing some cologne, all right?
(seeing Jerry's van shaking) What is that? That van's a-rockin'.
But in the zoo, you know, they might, put a woman in there with me to uh.. you know, get me to mate.
Let me tell you something. No one walks into a beauty parlor and says "Give me the Larry Fine."
Alright, now, how are we gonna monitor this thing?
Lot of good ones. I don't even want to mention anyone because I'm afraid I'm going to leave somebody out.
(from bathroom) How was Eric Roberts as the husband?
Slippery Pete. Kramer, hurry up!
Are.. are you okay?
How much?
Awright, I'll see you later.
There is no problem. . . just a small miscommunication. Whereby you thanked her instead of the person actually responsible for purchasing the big salad.
Si, si.
No, it's, it's his. (indicates Jerry)
Were having lunch with a friend. He works in the building.
So, uh, you gonna see him again?
What, are you crazy? I can't have a man touching me. Switch with me.
I can see that.
To hell with Elaine!
I went in with a pretty woman? You know, kinda short, big wall o' hair, face like a frying pan?
(on intercom) It's George.
You are my friend.
Let me ask you a question. Who would win in a fight between you and me?
You're *selling* the car!?
I knew I had hit my high note so I thanked the crowd and I was gone.
(pointing to Jerry in joyous agreement) Ha-ha-hah. This is my lucky day.
Hey, hey. Kramer, what are you doing? You can't smoke in here.
(impatient) What about Marisa Tomei?!
No, no, no. Nothing happens.
I know. That's the point. If it's gonna get sexual, it should get sexual with you.
Allright, very good I'd like my car and my deposit back please
Who said anything about money? (intercom buzzes)
What?
What is that? Is taht the pole?!
Have you ever had their egg salad?
No, no the full size.
You'll do it?
Milano.
What is with this family?
Dwayne, my friend and I would like to exchange frames. Could you put his lenses in my frames and mine in his?
Friars.
To do what?! Work in a post office? Is that what you want me to do?
Why don't you just look at your watch?
He can be pedantic. He can be pedantic.
(shouting) How d'you not like Soda?! It's bubbly, it's refreshing!
(ignoring Jerry) I mean I'm not really working right now.
Ah, excuse me. Do you have, uh, change of a dollar?
(to Jerry) Huh-ho! Have you ever seen anything like this?
You want me to find a poem about Susan? May she rest in peace?!
Hey, Elaine. Maybe his girlfriend is Lois Loan.
Oh, hello, it's you! (angry) Listen lady, I got six minutes left on that meter, and I'm not budging til you admit you stole my twenty dollars. (smug) Huh-hu-hur, you're not so tough when you're not on your horse, are you Ruthie?
(To Estelle) Scissor. (She gets the scissors from the coffee table and hands them to George with the point facing him) Don't hand them to me with the point facing out!
So then what?
but..why, it wasn't my fault, I .. you asked me a sandwich, I .. I make such delicious sandwiches Elaine
Why don't they have salsa on the table?
No, no, this wasn't moving on. I got the hook. I wish I could get a lesson in that.
Now, this is the basic layout for Mario's Pizza.
sweetheart, no come here,  sweetheart
B-O-Z-O?
What about the skin? I need a good cheek, I like a good cheek.
(Stops) Oh right, the blind date.
I think she wants me to take her home.
What about the dolphins? You could swim with the dolphins down there.
Hi...
That guy is not blind.
It may have moved, I don't know.
Hey, you grew a beard, huh?
Yeah. The *original*.
Yeah. Anyway, he shamed me into it.
Marla.
(Irritated) It's called a T-square.
Yes.
Yeah, yeah, sure, Christmas. Snow. Santa. All that stuff.
What number?
Summer of '89 I'm at the beach. This family sits up next to me. I go in to the surfs and when I come from out, my clothes, my towel, my umbrella, they're all gone. I am furious, I start screaming to these kids demanding my stuff back and finally I lose it; I grab their boom box and I chuck it in to the ocean.
Pre-nup of course ..Kramer....
No, an old friend of ours, Gary.
Alright, let's go.
We're on the Grand Central, there's no traffic.
[to himself] Hey, whatd'ya know? Look at that! A *lesbian* sighting. Oh-ho! My lucky day. They're *so* fascinating. Why is that? Because they don't want us. You gotta respect that...
Salsa is now the number one condiment in America.
Well, if I could talk to the mothers and have sex with the daughters, then I'd really have something goin'.
This is it! It happened to me, Jerry! I was sitting in the restaurant, the two nut jobs were talking - I couldn't take it any more. I got up, and (Makes a noise) I bop into this woman..
Yes I do.
What is Lloyd Braun doing here?
What?
All right, look. I'm getting the Chow Fung. You don't have to have any.
You know, Jason, I, uh, I couldn't help notice, I... I didn't get my apology.
What, is that the one your parents gave you?
Are you crazy?! What are you doing?! You'll get us killed!
You shouldn't have tucked.
Artie Schuman? From Camp Hatchapee?
You know, I can't talk to you anymore.
Thank you Mr.Farkus, thank you very much indeed sir.
Hey, look, Kramer,
(proffering glasses) I hope prune juice is alright. It's the only thing I had that was chilled.
Listen I was talking to Elaine today and she said she'd would really like to be an usher at the wedding
One little bite.
(reading the tabs) Jerry, yours is eleven dollars.
She is a good waitress.
So what could I do? I couldn't go through with it. She threatened to kill herself.
I don't know. He can be so weird sometimes.
Bring it on, baby
Well, should I call you later?
Yes, yes,.
she's there, I can hear her
You can stuff you sorries in a sack, mister!
Svenjolly. (licking a little bit of peanut butter from his finger)
But if you think about it...26 teams, 162 games a season, you'd think eventually an entire team would get wiped out.
Yeah. (Jerry nodding) ... Oh, you think because of what I said about the manure. I wa, wa, was just saying how it takes a negative thing, and puts it on a positive spin on it.
Yep. Classic horseshoe pattern. I've seen a lot of this.
Fired? Why?
What is this 'saving movies' thing? Something's playing, you go.
For 50 bucks? I'd put my face in the soup and blow.
Okay. A little.
Bob Cobb?
It's about nothing.
Well, I didn't think anyone would play it.
That's right, no discount!
You've never seen this before?
Well it's not up my alley! It's one thing if I make it up. I know what I'm doin, I know my alleys! You got me in the Galapagos Islands livin' with the turtles, I don't know where the hell I am.
Ohh.. Paco! (Flicks rubber band tward the kitchen) Hey, take a look at this. (Hands Jerry Kruger's check)
Now, each of you is here because you're the best at what you do.
You don't want to suffer with this all weekend.
Oh I think I'd go for the back.
Yeah. yeah. I-I know.
Hey Joey, how you doin'?
Hey!
I like, uh...(mutters something unintelligible under his breath.)
Why does everything have to be 'us'? Is there no 'me' left? Why can't there be some things just for me? Is that so selfish?
(attacking Kramer) How could you give me a defective condom?!
A player?
Step-skipper. That man is a step-skipper! He skips Step Nine!
She hasn't seen the article! When she sees it, she's gonna think-- *I'm out baby*!! I'm out!!!!!
(chases after her) Wait a minute! You're--now you're getting a divorce because she's from Long Island?!?!
Well, this is a lovely apartment. Lovely! My kids are gonna go crazy. I, uh, I wonder if I could see the bathrooms. Preferably one with some paint thinner and, uh, some rags?
Ah, beat it, punk.
I gotta go back to the library and talk to him. I gotta find out if I&Mac226;m the guy who ruined his life.
(singing)  Master of the house/Keeper of the inn... (Jerry re-enters the living room and modestly models his new jacket for George. George is impressed.) This is huge! When did this happen?
Uhh.. I'll- I'll meet you down there.
Well, they get very hot in the polyester. You know, it's not a natural fibre. I think they would prefer cotton.
I asked if I could borrow a sweater.
Hey Elaine, does Tony like peanut butter?
Oh, hello Professor.
You're very good. Very good with the moanings and the gyrations. Y-You really had me going there for a minute.
Just CALL!
Yes, I heard you!
They gave me the Pensky file.
When is it going to be my turn, Jerry? When do I get my 15 minutes? I want my 15 minutes!
I guess... (chuckles) today shes late.
Let's see if it's Hayman?
Okay. Good.
"Jerry", oh my God. He wants to talk about "Jerry"?
He..he wants to talk to me?
No, no. Deena, it's not what you think.
So, they knew? Those liars!
(Complaining) I can't read it. I need my glasses!
Anyway, again, I'm sorry about throwing you out of the car.
Alright so you made out with someone.
Whooo.. (To a waitress taking orders) Ooh.. French fries.
Why do they have to do that in front of people?
You know it must be impossible for a Spanish person to order seltzer and not get salsa. (Angry) "I wanted seltzer, not salsa."
Oh great.
Well, I wish I could say the same, but I must say, with all due respect, I find it very hard to see the logic behind some of the moves you have made with this fine organization. In the past twenty years you have caused myself, and the city of New York, a good deal of distress, as we have watched you take our beloved Yankees and reduced them to a laughing stock, all for the glorification of your massive ego!
When are they gonna have the flying cars, already?
Oh yeah.. (Starts to open it) Sally called Susan - said you guys really hit it off.
Yeah. She should be commending me for treating everyone like equals.
Hey, uh...
I dunno sometimes...
We do?
It's George.
Yeah.
So what do you do?
Check, please.
Whoa! Whoa! Geez!
and JERRY Very nice, very nice, nice.
Nothing...little problem.
Yeeeaaah. (Jerry and George lean in to make their conversation a little more private) Well..... I've never really felt confident in uh..... one particular aspect.
Yeah?...
That should be 14, let me just...(corrects it with a pen.)
Why did he tell you and not me?
Well, I'm sure at some point between the years 800 and 1200--somewhere--there were two women living together.
Coco?
Moose?
OOuuoo! They could use the break!
No-no-no, we all chipped in. We have the money.
How should I know?
Elle McPherson going to be there?
What did we say? Two seventy-five?
Are you supposed to yell it?
How's everything going? Everything O.K.?
What was wrong with that sorry? It was a good sorry. Jerry, was that a good sorry?
Who is Sir Arthur Conan Doyle?
Okay. Now, why do I have to see (points) you?
"Hey listen, let me give you my card. It's got my home number on it. I want to buy the first pair when the next shipment comes in."
I mean I'm the one who bought it.
Okay.
That reminds me, I'm not getting you guys any more fruit. That guy was eyeballing me the whole time. He gave me the creeps. All right, you owe me twenty-eight sixty.
Yeah! Boy, she is something, isn't she?
It's an expression.
Yeah, yeah, well, because of the cane. You should see the bathroom they gave me!
Hi.
Well, at least, I'm not carrying a purse.
Huh, nggh [snort] Stop. (flirting with her he playfully hits her arm with the menu, then flicks it into the air)
Rosses.
Food?
(to the executives) Excuse me. Did you hire the Sunshine Carpet Cleaners?
Yes it is. She just took credit for my salad. That's not right.
Wha - what are you doing later?
So, I'm uh, I'm afraid we're going to have to pass.
Yeah, you know we spoke for a little bit...
Oh, it's good.
Oh of course you can use it, sure. (Jerry saying stuff through the phone) Ok, bye. (hangs the phone up)
Hey, by the way, if anybody wants an inside tour of the zoo, Siena works there as a trainer.
No I can't. I can't die with dignity. I have no dignity. I want to be the one person who doesn't die with dignity. I live my whole life in shame. Why should I die with dignity?
he..he's alive
Is that good?
I think we got a bite on it. (Exits)
Yeah, like that.
(not happy delivering Elaine's lie) Well, he uh, he wants to uh, quit the exporting and uh, focus just on the importing. And it's a problem, because she thinks the exporting is as important as the importing.
Well it's over. It's definitely over.
Like retouched.
What?
Let me just say this. It is inhumane to make a man stand on his feet, in one spot for eight hours a day. Why shouldn't he have a chair?
(irascible) Oh, I see. So your time is more valuable than mine. Is that it? You're a delicate genius!
This country needs more people like you!
Hey, grown-up. (they both chuckle, George notices Gwen enter the room) Oh my god, there she is. Go ahead, go ahead. (to the others) Let's go, let's go. All right what are they saying?
(animated) Fixed up? A cup of coffee! A cup of coffee is not a fix up!
You, uh, wanted to see me, Mr. Steinbrenner?
"George is getting upset.."
Ma, your eyes!
Did you see that? That-that pigeon didn't move! I had to swerve to get out of the way! I saved that pigeons life!
(to Donna) Why did you have to get me in trouble?
You're *damn* right it's me.
Um, all right, um, uh, I'll call 'ya. I'll call you and we'll talk on the phone. A telephone communiqu. Every thing is fine ok, uh, fine, .. [exits]
It wasn't that bad.
I'm bored. She's boring, I'm boring, we're both boring. We got out to eat, we both read newspapers.
A man gave me...
Well I, uh, I'm not sure how you pronounce it or anything, but I, uh, I believe it's Mnage  Trois?
Because I kissed her in the meeting. Russell found out, he fired her over the phone. Finally, my stupidity pays off!
So where are you staying?
You see... All right I knew it.
Hello.
And she'll still see it, you're not stopping her from seeing it.
Well,,, it's getting dark.
This car out there is taking up, like, three parking spaces.
Wish I could. (raises the magazine up in front of his face and continues reading.)
Don't you see what it says here? Don't you understand what that's implying?
Yeah! Alright, I'm pulling in.
Yeah.
Yes! I mean, if she thinks that's me she's under a complete misapprehension. That was not me, Jerry. That was not me.
How could I possibly interfere?
"Yeah,yeah yeah yeah! I've seen these.....they sorta ..they make your legs..stronger."
Very good.
How are we gonna get out of here? We need a plan!
No, you go Guggenheim. I'm not much of a Guggenheim.
Oh you can stuff your sorries in a sack, Mister!
Packyderm?
So, she was switching? Back and forth?
What did they do for toilet paper in the civil war?
Alright, let's go.
Well I know how to drive.
They are?
Hey, Ring Dings are better than anything you're gonna get at a bakery.
Oh.. nice.
Is that what I ask for? The BIG salad?
Jerry ... Where are you? I know you like to sit back here. Elaine! Susan!
Alright, Lupe, bye-bye now.
Well, that's not offensive. (Reflects) It's abnormal, but it's not offensive.
Hey, where you just at the health club?
Really?
Every five years!
How do you know?
(shaking hands) I'm George.
Oh, you spoiled, spoiled man. Do you now how much mental energy I expend just trying to picture women naked?
I was, I had to leave. She lit some vanilla incenses. The smell drove me nuts, all I could think about was food, I had to get out of there. We need some pudding here! Pudding!
Yeah.
You wanna sell computers? I will show *you* how to sell computers! Hello, Mr. Farneman. You wanna buy a computer? No? Why not? All right, I see! Good answer! Thank you! (Lloyd rings his sale bell) Serenity now!
What do you mean, I got? You didn't give him his Visa application.
What is he talking about?
Get out?
You're not a doctor. You shouldn't even have books like this.
He got about uh, two inches from... there.
She, uh, went shopping for some shoes for the wedding and, yada yada yada, I'll see her in six to eight months. (Kramer and Julie enter)
They're worse! They're much worse than us, they talk about everything! Couldn't you at least tell her about the shrinkage factor?
Why them? Why not me?
Yes! Because it is the mature, adult thing to do.
I don't know, uh...
Are you sure? Oh, look who I'm talking to. The president of NBC. (forced laughter)
Everybody's talkin' at me...I can't hear a word they're sayin'...just drivin' around in Jon Voight's car...
That's where the Seinfeld's are moving. They got a great deal. Yep. You know what they got in Florida? Jai-Alai! You bet on the games, you clean up.
I had to give it to the liquor store guy.
Well, well, I had a dream, Jerry.
Its Martine. I think hes dying. He tried to kill himself with pills.
Geez, Hey you know something, you should try my friend's wake up service. She swears by this thing.
Hey, thanks for coming with me.
Boy you are really smitten.
I see.
Yeah, yeah. You must have squirted a piece of pulp in it too.
You see? We were made for each other. (Thinking to himself) It's amazing. If I reach out and touch her breast right not, she'd scream and throw me out of the car. But at this time tomorrow, I could touch it all I want.
(sensing his chance) Well, they do now. Neighborhood's changing.
Well who doesn't.
Because the underwear is pulled up from the back and ... it wedges in..
Well, here we are.
And why shouldn't you? Be fresh Stay fresh
Hello.
(from bathroom) VANDELAY, SAY VANDELAY!
Of course you will. (quick chuckle). You're the best. (with a light fist motion across her chin)
Yeah, I should do the opposite, I should.
Hey, I know what I'm talking about. I gotta be honest with you, I gotta tell ya... Ever since I saw you holding hands with that woman, I can't get you out of my mind.
Alright, forget Elaine.
Laura, sure.
Why not?
Because of me? You must be joking! Who wouldn't want to live because of me? I'm nothing!
Students cant clean. Its anathema. (explaining) They dont like it.
Oh, I pleaded with him.
Beautiful women. You know they could get away with murder. You never she any of them lift anything over three pounds. They get whatever they want whenever they want it. You can't stop them.
Well I guess that's because I wear boxer shorts.
This catalog is all about how to score in a foreign country.
Good thinking!
(pointing at Jerry) Oh, hes the comedian.
"All right Jimmy Good talking to ya."
I leave you alone for two seconds, and this is what you do! I trusted you!
So, what's wrong with him?
All I know is I've been going to doctors all my life. What has it gotten me? I'm thirty-three years old. I haven't outgrown the problems of puberty, I'm already facing the problems of old age. I completely skipped healthy adulthood. I went from having orgasms immediately to taking forever. You could do your taxes in the time it takes me to have an orgasm. I've never had a normal, medium orgasm.
Nothing.
(to Jerry, as Jerry nods in agreement) You know I think she might have something there.
Can you uh, go in the bubble?
She's still doing that?
I left it at Heather's. Are these alive? (pounding on glass display)
Wow.
Were you just talking about me? What's going on?
Well, didn't he regift the label maker?
What are you going to say?
So, attractive one day - not attractive the next?
And she didn't say something to you about a certain something?
Uh, about two hundred dollars, Miss DeMooney.
Hey Kramer, c'mon-- it was 240 bucks twenty years ago...
Well, it's all over. I slipped up.
You know a lost and found could be a good idea.
What if we grew muttonchops?
Hey, I am not a prude sweetheart. I swing with the best of them. (snapping his fingers 5 times)
Yeah I'm, eh, in 'the market'.
All right, look--wait--wait--Krama--wait, wait a minute, you are not. You are not goin' in. Ah-ahhh!
You know what this means? I can't see her anymore either.
He didn't get better, did he?
Well, how did she react?
A-hu no, uh, it's just that ...
Well you know in college they used to call me the little bulldog.
Oh, my God, No, oh my God, . . . Jerry!
Well what would I say in the note?
(smiling) What about Sharon Besser?
Magellan? You like Magellan?
(quiet) Uh-oh.
Who?
What?
Hey, Mr Seinfeld. (shakes Morty's hand) Hey, Mrs Seinfeld. How are you?
What am I going to do now? I can't live without Susan. I gotta get her back. How? How, am I gonna get her back?
I said, Listen Marlene, and then the next thing I know, Im in the middle of it. And theres this voice inside of me going, Youre doing it! Youre doing it! And then she started to cry, and I weakened a bit. I almost relented, but the voice, Jerry, the voice said, Keep going, keep going. Youre almost out! Its like I was making a prison break, you know, and Im heading for the wall, and I trip and I twist my ankle, and they throw the light on you, you know. So, somehow I get though the crying and I keep running. Then the cursing started. Shes firing at me from the guard tower. Son of a bang! Son of a boom! I get to the top of the wall  the front door. I opened it up, Im one foot away, I took one last look around the penitentiary, and I jumped!
Did you buy this for me?
Oh, you might want to stick around Jerry. Mr. Thomassoulo picked the wrong man to hire because he was fake handicapped.
You're out?!
I know who it was too. It was the guy who interviewed me. He was very threatened by me. Why else wouldn't he hire me? I could sell latex like that (snaps fingers).
Alright, this is what ya gotta do I need ya to go out to the parking lot at Yankee Stadium, take the flyers off my car.
Hey.
No, you see? You got greedy.
Y'know what it is? It's "Clara Nightingale Syndrome." He falls ill; she falls in love.
You uh owe me for the ticket.
I'm the consolation guy...?
Its fabulous.
(???), we'll see you in a little while.
How can you compare you parents to my parents?!
The last time I saw her, she was naked.
No. Semi-daily. Four or five times a week.
You know what, bad mistake my mistake do me a favor go back to the other lane - you'll never get there - forget this lane - y'a kn ow what this lane stinks - go back to the other lane - bad decision - go go go take this light - take this light -
(shocked) When do I start?
You're going like that?
She said that?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's it. More of that, difficult. I'm a difficult seed.
MOOPS, MOOPS
Okay. (They walk around each other.) OK. Ill choose you. Whaddaya want?
You're not letting him win. He wins till you're forty.
Well just take an overview. Can't you just take an overview?
You're spending the weekend with Ellen?
Well I don't think she is a multiple sneezer, because she sneezed again later, and it was also a single.
Elaine?
Hey, Mr. Morgan how was your massage?
No! I'm not gonna do that! That's one step away from personal ads! And prostitutes! No! No, I am not going down that road! What does she look like?
W--then I'm pretty much where I am now. At least I got to take a ride on a spaceship.
Hey, how ya doing?!?
Why, you think you can, beat me up?
Drink up. (Levitan takes a drink)
I didn't think you wore them anymore.
No.
Tennis courts? W-w-what about the yard? Where do they have the gang fights?
I'm gonna get some more of these kosher cocktail franks.. (leaves)
Nah.
Really? They work here in the office?
I'm George.. George Costanza.. I've never been in the hospital a day in my life.. except when I had my tonsils out. You know, they never gave me any ice cream. I always felt that-
Where'd you go?
Uh, Rick..
How did you know that?
I dont know what the hell I said. I gave her an ultimatum and theres nothing I can do. Its a machine. The little light is blinking right now, Come and listen to the idiot. Hey everybody, the idiots on!
Well then...then you really have something to think about because.....you know if there's any doubt in your mind ....and.. and,, it doesn't even have to be a big doubt, you know even a tiny doubt, a DOT of a doubt.. and.....
Oh yes I am Father. Incredibly sincere. So, uh, pffft, am I in?
I was trying to stick the landing. (indistinct) ...was right around here.
Me, too.
Five-foot four. Why?
I hurt it in a hotel room. You know where they tuck the covers in real tight in those hotel rooms? I can't sleep like that so I tried to kick it out and I pulled it.
well humm.. lets get some coffee.
Silence YES!!
good thing I asked
Oh, yeah. Still in good with the ground crew. (Laghs)
Hello, friend. Enjoying the flight?
Oh. The summer me.
What about that?
You know, it's not the S.A.T.s!
Did you pass your stone yet?
Great! I ate the entire platter! Had to call in sick today.
Soda. S-O-D-A. Soda.
Yeah, woman have no problem getting the hand off. How do they do that?
Oh yes I am
But I asked you before if you had a ticket, and you said no!
Oh yeah, you were right. She's gorgeous.
It is a horrible company. There's no management what so ever. I could go hog wild in there.
All right, uh, okay, I got it, um, Ill sing.
You know what I was just thinking -- she could really use a raise.
Hey, I saw what I saw.
No it's not, it's the ticket-<buyers> line.
Yeah, good, good.
Thanks.
Oh! you taped it?
Well, I can see that. What do you have to do that for? Who cares about your pants size?
Elaine?
No, say. I want you to say.
Where?
You're right, how did I miss that? (Begins unlocking the door, mutters under his breath) Maybe because it's a crock of shit.
The side?
What?
I just thought it would be nice. A little variety.
(Praising Leo's stealing) Alright, Leo! Stickin' it to the man!
I told her that she was pretentious.
(to Elaine) Right, alright. (to Jerry) Oh Jerry, do you have any apples?
Come on! No doctor would put that on his car.
Well, sometimes you can't help these people 'til they hit rock bottom.
How come uh, no chair?
Me? Oh yeah.
I still haven't figured him out.
(To Jerry) Let me ask you something.. How much do you think it would cost to have tonsils and adenoids removed in the hospital?
Well, I was very comfortable! I've got my nuts here...
Well, if she was a criminal and you had to describe her to a police sketch artist...
You do?
I have nothing to say to anybody. I'm so uninteresting. I think I'm out of conversation.
(worked up) Because if she gets it back, then you'll have no reason to be sour. You'll de-sour, right?
(smiles) Beats the hell out of coffee.
Uh, excuse me, uh, um, Jason. I don't want to get into a big thing here, but... I'm not sure if, technically, what you just said was actually an apology.
Mind? Why would I mind? I would love to wait! (shakes hands with Nana) Nana, nice to see you. Ni-ni-ni-ni-NANA! (embraces another guest, kisses her) Aunt Phyllis, always a pleasure. What a pleasure! Hey, let's do this again real soon. I had fun, huh?
I just don't feel like it anymore.
The sex wasn't so good?
All right, so what's the penalty here? Let's just pay the fine or something and get the hell out of here.
It's my head!
Carl... Yeah, he was a nice guy.
Of course, I'm the result of my parents having stayed together, so you never know. (Russell comes out of the bathroom.)
(shouting) Turn your key, Maura. Turn your key!
They're not mocked and humiliated when they get to the other side.
No, I was just wondering... if you guys, uh, had any gum.
--and this is Kramer.
Kramer, hey, hey! (Gets up out of his seat)
Well how do you even know its hers? Maybe it belonged to Carol. Did you see a name on the tube?
I'll drive.
(he walks casually to Tom, and taps his arm) Listen. I know we've had our problems in the past, but we got a show to do tonight. Time to pull together as a team. Life's too short. I say, let's let bygones be bygones. If you took the raisins, if you didn't take the raisins-- They weren't even my raisins. I was just curious because it seems like a strange to do to walk into a room, audition, and to walk out with a box of raisins. Anyway, whatever. If you ever want to tell me about it, the door to my office is always opened. In the event that I get an office. You'll come in, we'll talk about the raisins. We'll have a nice laugh.
Yeah, come on.
Chaperone? What, are you kidding?
Awright, lemme just say this. Ten thousand dollars, alright, and now I'm going below what you wanted to pay. You have your dinner, have your veal, or whatever it is. Enjoy...
No keys. And I been calling the city all day. Course there's not really a number to call if you wanna make a pothole.
They'll make you a Big Salad. What do you think, they're the only one's that make a Big Salad?
Totally folksy.
Well, did you see it?
I gotta prep. I need a couple of anecdotes, a few you-were-right-abouts. It's a whole procedure. Wasn't Fragile Frankie the one that used to run into the woods every time he got upset?
Why not?
Radiating waves of pain..
Yeah. You like it.
You got mugged?
Nah - what for?
The comedian, or the manager?
Nah, I don't like that one.
"Quite a workout"? What did you say?
You still owe me a secret.
Here ... something.
That's right. I'm two in the hole!
Who are you to play God!? Every man's time comes! If his number is up, who are you to interfere!?
I'm just sayin' I wanna have some fun.
Whatcha got there, the 4-volt? Heh, I did you a favor.
Yes! Yes, I'm the one! Hey! So, you know Jon Voight!
Well, it's a tough decision. I have to wear these every day. I'm deciding on a new face.
I meet this women, Sheila. She works down at the one hour photo pace. She's got this incredible smile. Like she's got extra teeth or something
(sings) Co-stan-za. (like "By Mennen")
Sorry, Mr Wilhelm.
Its bad?
(Holding up Kramer's book) According to this, it took.. 10 hours. It eased into the water like an old man into a nice warm bath - no offence. (Pause) So, uh, Clarence, how about abandoning this apartment, and letting me shove off in this beauty?
I'm trying to get out of this Big Brother program. So when you get to Paris (handing Morty the postcards) all you have to do is drop 'em in any mailbox.
I am different, yeah.
Oh my God! (coming out of bathroom) You know what I just realized?! If they get divorced an' live in two separate places? That's twice as many visits!
Like what? I'm bald? What is it specifically? Is, is there an odor I'm not aware of?
Do I really have to buy her something?
(looking uncomfortable) Um... yeah! Sure, sure I'm interested.
(puts down handset) Because he'll know I told you. Besides, he's giving me a parking spot around the corner for practically nothing.
"All right, I'll see you guys later."
And then assuming the strike is resolved, on April 14th, we, ah, play the Angels. So lets clear a floor at the Anaheim Hotel.
I like to get the Daily News!
You pick it.
Who puts a bench in their house?
Mr Reichman?
Hello?
So what have you been doing with yourself?
Who's Killer Kowalski?
He frolfs, he scores...(he drops one invitation on the stairs.)
(Loud, so everyone at the wedding can hear) You slept with the groom?!
(singing) Master of the house/Doling out the charm/Ready with a handshake and an open palm/Tells a saucy talk/Loves to make a stir/Everyone appreciates a...
Well, I can't walk anywhere now. I'm just gonna be wishing there were walkways. (seeing Elaine removing her shoe) What are you doing?
Oh. That's good.
We're out of Bosco!
Ech. What else you got?
(pause) What do you think, Jerry.
I do too. you see that's what we're about . You don't remind me of anyone and we love gum.
Guess what.
Ahoy! Mr. Eldridge. I understand you were on the Andrea Doria.
I love that bathroom. It's got that high, high toilet. I feel like a gargoyle perched on the ledge of a building.
I show up.
What do I do?! What do I do?!
Pick it up, pick it up!
(Laughs) yeah, burned. Whoo..
You could pet them. They come right out of the water onto the sidewalks.
(grateful, relieved) Thank you! I'm gonna make you both so happy!
No harm!
(surprised) So, I'm Neil? How did I do that?
Oh, Hey, hey, hey! That's great! That's very nice. You know we've been waiting twenty minutes for you people?! What do you think, you're Mussolini?!
I can't believe she got involved with a shrink.
Men have been popping into my sexual fantasies. All of a sudden I'll be, in the middle.
Boom!
Why don't you just ask Jeffrey?
Hello there. I'm George Costanza.
I havent seen him for months.
Hey.
Oh, I just, uh, leased a house out in the Hamptons, and I have got to get out there this weekend and sign the papers.
(whispering angrily) Okay. Okay. Fine.
(pointing out the positive) But happy.
You think?
All I know about is sports. That's it. No matter how depressed I get, I could always read the sports section.
You are aware that Pensky is interested in me.
I'd go to prison as your accomplice. I'd have to wear that really heavy denim. Go to the cafeteria line with the guy who slops those mashed potatoes onto your plate. Go to the bathroom in front of hundreds of people.
Excuse me. Am I talking to you, Pinhead? Am I?!
Ya
So, she doesnt move in.
I'm cheap? You think I'm CHEAP? How could you say that to me? I can't believe this. How could you say that to me?
Could she do that at Kruger?
You're sorry?!
I'm sure we're all aware of the flaws and biases of standardized tests..
Korea.
Oh, yeah? Holistic.. that's what I need. That's the answer.
No (snorts - Laughing nervously)... I'm gonna wear black shoes.
(sad) Yeah! Yeah. Hey--hey you, you know.. Maybe I'll call you sometime.
Not exactly. What does that mean?
Get a good night's sleep, alright fellas. (thumbs up) Big day tomorrow!
Holistic.. that sounds right.
(still quiet) Think, a second. You know, your friend was talking about me and, you know...
There she is. (waiving his arms quickly above the table - to nix the conversation) No no no no no no.
I had a fight with Susan.
What if I want to walk around a little?
The only thing that bothers me is that I'm just coming up with this now.
Gennice palying today?
Yes and I was hoping ... to get a thirteen week extension.
Who is this? (sees photo)
Pop? What happened to Pop?
Shut up!
What kind of money you think your parents have?
Elaine, what are you doing?
It's MOOPS.
Speak now, or we are headed to the Hamptons. It's a two-hour drive. Once you get in that car, we are going all the way... to the Hamptons. All right, you wanna get nuts? Come on. Let's get nuts!
Oh!, he he, It was unbelievable
No.
Well, I'm doing it, Jerry. I'm buying the Frogger machine. Now the torch will burn forever.
Well, it's just, all you said was 'your welcome', which is nice. It's very nice. But... I feel I gotta get the apology.
Dark and disturbed? His whole life revolves around Superman and cereal. I convinced him to act like that so that you would think I was funnier. That's how disturbed I am! If you want disturbed, that's disturbed. You can't find sickness like that anywhere, you think sickness like that grows on trees? Nobody is sicker than me, nobody. He's pretending, I'm the genuine article.
When she goes to the bathroom.
Lunch is fine at the beginning then you move on to dinner. you don't move back to lunch. It's like being demoted. I'll never do another crossword puzzle with her again. I know it.
Hi! Mr. West, this is my friend Elaine--
Kramer,
[pause] Would I like to come up? I would love to come up. I, I'm fighting not to. Fighting! Unfortunately I uh have to get an early start tomorrow. Gotta' get up and hit that pavement
I noticed you eh, chose the eh "clowns with balloons" check design.
This must be Sheila from the photo place.
Hey.
Well, I'll tell you, Stacey. It's a lot of hard work. But, it comes fairly easy to me. Some people write symphonies. This is my gift. (Raises ski lift ticket while Stacey looks away)
Shut up!
You should have somebody take a look at that.
First she screams, "George, what are you doing?! My God!" And it looked like she was gonna faint - she started clutching the wall, trying to hang onto it.
So, what do you think?
Elaine, don't interrupt, they're discounting something.
I don't like it, it's red. It it's too flashy.
What?
What do you mean?
What? The guy asked you to HELP HIM MOVE? Wow.
Well, not recently. I craved. I crave all the time, constant craving...but I haven't yearned.
(running out and away from the van) I knew it wasn't Berkowitz!
I look like me and I'm working from the outside. Who do you think is in the better position?
Yeah. Actually it was in gym class. I was trying to climb the ropes and Jerry was spotting me. I kept slipping and burning my thighs and then finally I slipped and fell on Jerry's head. We've been close ever since.
I can't go in there. I can't face the bubble boy.
Aren't those the guys that always go crazy and come back with a gun and shoot everybody?
Is that the lovely Mrs. Morgan?
It's too late.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. You can't say anything. (rushes to take phone from Jerry)
Is it that obvious?
Hey. Where is everyone?
(confused) What, what's going on?
Let me just see it.
To spite your parents!
Besides, what's it gonna cost me? Thirty-eight bucks?
So, how was the movie?
What kind of a greeting was that?
No. Rice and caramel.
I know the D is the biggest. I've based my whole life on knowing that the D is the biggest.
Yeah, take it easy.
(thinking to himself) Oh my god, there she is. That's the face, just like the picture.
Yeah.
So, you wanna go home and...make up, officially?
That's right. You ready?
(bewildered) Heh heh.
Yeah, ha ha, It's not the toilets, it's not the toilets. It's something else. Are you ready for this?
I dont know. I cant believe theyre making me take this test.
Tub is love?
Do you speak English?...English!!
Yeah. Hi. It's great to meet you.
Yeah, yeah. Big advisor.
'Cause I shaved yesterday in the afternoon.
You should have lied.
Well actually I'm...
You have no idea how refreshing that is.
I know.
You're cutting me off? No, no, no Jerry, don't cut me off!
Hi ah, My name is George.
Yeah. I'll see you later.
You go over there -
yeah
I got nothing, Jerry. Nothing.
Regards?
My name is not mentioned in this blurb...
Oh, no no no -- We bought the wine here before, but now, you know we're bl-blocked in by some car double parked and we're just waiting for the guy to pull out.
Pbbbs, Bubkis!
Hi Amy, I'm George.
"You sell them?"
What do we have in the fruit department?
They had a pastry cart you wouldn't believe.
And-and you just decided to pop in...!
I don't know. That's all gonna change.
But you didn't use a coaster, Jerry, you left a stain! (he runs to kitchen)
Thanks Roy.
What kind of a sick impulse does that??
I was doing standup comedy in Kennebunkport Maine. ??? night club. The stage was on a cliff and the audience was throwing all the comics off.
WOW!
I'm good.
It's that bleak? (pours a glass of milk)
(Gets up to leave) Well, scintillating as always.
Just like that.
What is Holland?
What do you mean?
Well so what's the problem, you just put some newspaper down.
Whatever. Believe me, if I wasn't involved right now, I wouldn't mind being set up. Something tells me she's a knockout. (we see, from the camera inside the cab, George's hand waving as the cab drives away)
No, they're not funny at all. No, I have no funny friends. I'm the funny one. El Clowno.
Maybe she wasn't! Maybe she heard the whole conversation!
The closet business? What's the closet business?
I know. It's Mickey Mantle's number. So not only is it an all around beautiful name, it is also a living tribute.
How could you do that?
Uh, no, I, I dont think so.
It would have been nice if someone told me about it. I just think you could have said something. That's all.
You don't know?
Ho, ho, ho! Hes got a live one. Hes just reeling his big fish in!
Oh yeeah.. well , Big smoker... I (coughs some more) gave it up for a while but it was too tough. Y' know.....I got no will power.
I dont know. But he aint funny.
Yep, and the photo was all fixed and back on his desk, no thanks to you.
What?
(frustrated) Ohh, I wanted to see that. (waves his arms in frustration) Thanks. Thanks a lot.
(standing) Not yet, but she's weakening.
S-s-somebody double parked, we couldn't help it. It might have been Saddam Hussein, we're not really sure. He eh, had a British accent though.
That's because it's underwater.
Of course it's cashmere.
Yeah, good night.
Oh...you're very good.
Why don't you just call 911?
Dad, it's me. Hey, listen, I was at Fortunoff's the other day, and, you know what, you were right.
Our show, "Jerry"?
Ooooh, yes they do.
The cashier is at lunch - which is where Id like to be.
Fifty-fifty.
All right. (throws his coat back down on the seat and sits down opposite them)
She works for NBC.
Because filth is good. Whaddaya think, rock stars have sponges and ammonia lyin around the bathroom? They, have a woman comin over, Ive gotta tidy up? Yeah right, in these matters you never do what your instincts tell you. Always, ALWAYS do the opposite.
You enjoying yourself? (More laughs from Elaine)
85!
Well why couldn't you include me in your excuse?
So dont finish it.
They made me buy it.. A hundred bucks this thing cost me. (Gesturing to the book) How dare they?! I got news for you, if it wasn't for the toilet, there would be no books.
Oh, *please*! Me? C'mon! That's *great*! Are you kidding? I think thats fan*tastic*! I've always encouraged experimentation! I'm the first guy in the pool! Who do you think you're talking to?
Ok, everybody, uh...I have an announcement to make. From now on, I will be known as-
Natalie?
Shall we say an hour.
All right (he smiles weakly at Maura)
(on the speaker) Ya
My card won't work there; they're not on the Plus system.
(relishing) Hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm. Delicious.
Yeah, yeah. Shes punctual... and uh shes been late, sometimes.
Wha, where is he going?
What, Minelli's!?!
Well I think I'm better off going one-on-one.
Goodbye (exits cab)
I dont know. All of em. Theyre all crooks! Besides, I couldnt get all different candy bars, anyway.
What are you talking about?
Mon...? No, no, I can't wait til Monday, that's impossible, I gotta talk to him now. Where does he live?
Really?
Jerry, you gotta talk to Sitarides.
Get out!
(playing it cool) I'm still here.
"Right!"
I am. Im a nice guy. And she seduced me! We were in my apartment, Im sitting on the couch, shes on the chair. I get up to go to the bathroom, I come back, shes on the couch. What am I supposed to do? Not do anything? I couldnt do that. I wouldve insulted her.
Well why'd she do that?
(pondering) Yes I suppose they do.
Head start, oh no absolutely not.
Three pints of Kramer's blood?
Well, I gotta do somethin'. (Walks over to bathroom. Kramer enters)
I told you those trips were relationship killers. Too bad you cant get your buddy Superman to fly around the Earth at super speed and reverse time. Youd get all the money back, you could have avoided the whole trip to Vermont...
What idea? I just said something. I didn't know you were going to listen to me.
Like a park bench?
She told me she wants-- (Pauses until a woman coming down the stairs passes) She told me she wants me to make love to her.
Why don't you just commit yourself already?
But your life is Peterman's. Now the bus tour, which is real, takes to places that, while they are real, they are not real in sense that they did not *really* happen to the *real* Peterman which is you.
Eh, listen Mr. Kruger, I got a message from Dr. Van Nostrand and he says it might be wise to you to see another doctor about that mole.
You've got a prayer.
Well, some women like it.
Why? Why is my code so important?
Haven't we had this conversation before?
(takes a bite) Oh, that's good. That's very good.
Tsss...Yeah..
Kramer...
Yeah, I turned him down.
Huh. What, the whole apartment?
For you.
Wow.
So we jump and roll, you won't get hurt.
We hardly read anything!
Mmm, no. Boy, it really didn't come out too well, did it?
(unenthusiastic) Congratulations.
Alright, here we go. You got it?
You had Sgt. Chadway? Me too.
...Huh?
So you slept with her?
Did you ever see her lose her temper. I was once late cause I bought a Panama hat -- she grabbed it by the brim, pulled it down so hard my head came right through the top of it.
I cant believe- (falls on his knees) WE ALREADY DISCUSSED THIS!
Slippery Pete, Kramer tells me you are one hell of a rogue electrician. And shlomo, you're the best truck driver.
(pulling out some money) Uh, yeah. Hang on. Just... yeah.
My little man doesn't know.
(Still focused on the nudist) They're naked, the gardeners naked.. the bellhops. (Jerry makes a noise of astonishment) One big nude-a-rama.
Well, is he good, Kramer?
Yes!
Sure, dudes in this town are dime a dozen.
You won the choose.
Certainly not.
Hurry up.
Hey, I just found twenty dollars! I tell you this, something is happening in my life. I did this opposite thing last night. Up was down, black was white, good was -
Hey, I am not here for rage. I'm here for revenge.
George.. (She doesn't seem to recognize him) George Costanza.
Drink your soda! Come on! I know you're there, laughing at me. Laughing and lying and laughing! I had to go to Reggies, Jerry! Reggies!
Oh yeah. So wait, wait. A half-hour later Im back in the office, I tell Lloyd the whole story. He says, So why dont you call her? I says, I cant. I couldnt, I couldnt do it right then. For me to ask a woman out I gotta get into a mental state like the karate guys before they break the bricks. So Lloyd calls me a wuss.
No-no-no, Kramer. Kramer! Kramer! You *cannot* abandon people in the middle of an airport pickup! It's a binding social contract. We... we must go forward... not back.
So, just bring her here. This is all you really need.
Just a little something for Christmas.
It's "ooh" As in "ooh ooh ah ah."
Oh come on? No come on. She took off her hat and there she was (waving his hand over his head) hello. It was like I was looking at myself in the mirror.
"George likes spicy chicken."
No, they had plans.
Anyway, I was thinking about what you said. About uh, me and Marisa.
You're you.
Oh, I don't think you want to do that.
He..hmmm. humm...What about this one.
I stopped having sex.
Purple 23.
He asked me to keep it a secret.
(pause) Uh-oh.
What? I'm not married. I'm not allowed to go out with somebody else?
So, uh are you sleeping with Peterman?
I'd kill to be a 32.
But it--eh.. It was here, I'm tellin' you, an' w--w--it was really here! The, there was, a, bar, and a, an' a dance floor..
Yesterday, took the day off. (Picks up a red Power Ranger action figure from the model and pretends it's him.) Now, from the time I left the room...
(Takes two oven mitts from his back pack) Alright, (puts them on) I gotta get going.
Because I know him too, and probably a lot better than you.
I'm still watching them.
The shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy, shmmopy, shmoopy!
Is "yada yada" bad?
What?
Well, not really. After all, she did get together with George Peppard. I mean, Fred.
I know....
My back is killing me.
Reilly is no longer with the club. (getting up) You believe that?
Would you like a chair?
Jerry? Jerry can you hear me?
Alright, so I haven't put anything in it since sixth grade, I completely forgot about it. The State Controller's Office tracks me down. The interest has accumulated to 1,900 dollars. 1,900 dollars! They're sending me a cheque!
Yes, positive.
Yeah. There's something wrong with that? I'm a character. People are always saying to me, "You know you're a quite a character."
Amazing. I drive them to lesbianism, he brings 'em back.
Get out of the car!
Elaine? (she turns, sighing) Can I come?
What are you? A *baby*!? All right. Tell her.
That's cute.
I dont know. But Simons said that if I wanted to get involved, that Wilkinson would tell me the exact right minute to sell. You wanna do it?
You vomited in 1987.
(Very loud in the direction of a waiter) I'm gonna need a coffee here. Very hot! Boiling!
No.
Heh he, I made it.
They'll call back.
yeah that's right. I like it. He's such a cool guy
Look, I am under direct orders from Mr Wilhelm. So if you have a problem with that, maybe you should just take it up with him.
Good for you.
Krama. Open up! I--I know you're in there!
I'm goin' in!
Yeah.
Right. Bye.
What about architect, Steven?
You know, like the general manager of a baseball team or something.
Really? My father has a ton of old clothes just sitting up in the attic, y-you think they're worth something?
I'm emotional.
(Holding camera) Look at this, I only have one picture left... How 'bout a shot of me and Mr. Morgan?
Well, people never give a good 'hello' at a funeral. I mean, they go like this (George gives an extremely understated nod) That's the biggest.
Well, it's the damnedest thing. The cat dies. So she comes back into town, she finds the cat lying on the carpet stiff as a board.
Not bad? It's gorgeous!
What's the deal with Aquaman? Could he go on land, or was he just restricted to water?
like that (looking at Jerry)
Ah-ha!
Oh...pretty good.
I don't care. Look, Lloyd doesn't know what he's up against. This is nothing to me. (moving his arm) My whole life is a lie.
It's the pesto of cities. So..?
Ma, guess what!
Boy that-that bank clock is-is eight minutes off.
Pack of gum. Here you go. (hands the clerk a $100 bill)
Never mind what happened, just give me the key.
Sometimes it's good to have a pencil to write these things down.
(from bathroom) VANDELAY, SAY VANDEL... (George falls) ... Vandelay Industries, ...
(to himself) Yeah, you said it. (to Wilhelm) Uh, excuse me, Mr Wilhelm. Uh, do you really think... Well, is this downtown trip really necessary, you know, for the project?
I need an outlet!
Right.
(to himself, resentful) What kind of a snobby, stuck-up, cult is this?!
What the hell is this? George, Elaine and I went to see Chunnel ... with Jerry. With Jerry, huh? With Jerry! Great. Great! (dials phone) Probably went to the 84th St. That's where I always go with Jerry.
Elaine's in love with the Wiz guy?
Yeah.
Well I still think it was wrong.
An eye job? Ma, you don't need an eye job.
You already have an in. You have the same first name!... (no reaction) 'Jerry'!
Actually, (George flips the book back to the beginning) I'll take these nice glossy ones.
(more nervous) What are you talking about?
Any more grape juice? (Gets up and goes to the kitchen. Remy moves to the end of the couch where George was sitting.)
(Entering Jerry's apartment with a cartload of computers) Jerry, I've found a way to beat Lloyd Braun! I buy the computers myself, I store 'em in your apartment. Then, after I win the contest, I bring 'em all back and get my money back. Ha ha! It's brilliant. What? What's wrong with your leg?
(resentfully dampened) It's not a prom. It's a Ball.
I want your honest opinion about something.
Ya, you go.
Hah.
No, wait!
Oh, very gracious.
I thought we'd all sign the picture.
Don't jinx it! Don't jinx (trails off quietly in elation)
Well, we're collectors. We, uh, see objects of great beauty and, uh, we must have them.
I was just in there. Its embarrassing.
What?
Jerry said he didn't like it.
Well, you could move in with my parents. (chuckles)
Del Boca Vista!
Its uh, it's only a few blocks.
And you met her in an antique store! I don't know how you do it!
(whistling).(laughing).AlrightOK.
Nah, I guess I should really get moving on this, huh? I'm gonna go. (Opens the door, letting Newman in. Leaves)
Well, here you go. What do you think?
Oh, I sure hope so.
Oh, can you be any more dramatic?
Oh boy.
Dolores!
I'm gay! I'm a gay man! I'm very, very gay.
Hey.
Is it with a "y"?
Did anybody see Firestorm?
Is he dead?
Well bear in mind that I am in the smaller office.
Whatever!!. . . . Oh oh oh this is unbelievable. This is better than my bed at home.
Kramer, I cant believe it. Oh, youre my hero!
Oh, you hesitated.
I tell you this. If the real Phil Rizzuto was down there, this wouldn't be happening!
(to himself) You can't tell much from those pictures.
Uh, C-R-E-S-P-I?
I'm moving to California.
Yeah.
What did you go out with me for?! Just to dump chocolate on my shirt and then just dump me altogether?! I don't deserve that kind of treatment! What, you don't have the common courtesy to return my calls?! To apologize! You think I'm some sort of a loser, that likes to be abused and ignored?! Who's shirt can be ruined without financial restitution?! Some sort of a masochist who enjoys being humiliated? You think you can avoid me like I have some sort of disease?! You have the disease! You have the disease! You may be beautiful and rich and physically .. just .. unbelievable, but you sicken me! You disgust me! You and everyone like you!
Not really. Your voice kind of raises to this comedic pitch. (Kramer enters)
Oh, no no no. Course not. I got a great name for our kids. A real original. You wanna hear what it is? Huh, you ready?
when did you get back?
I thought he looked Irish.
I wonder what toilet paper was loike in the 1860's. Did they carry it in rolls in their duffle bags?
Now?! I'm a mutant!
Hi, how are you guys? Listen, does either one of you have like a mint or piece of gum or...
(Frantically) Did anybody call here asking for Vandelay industries?
I didn't know you were such a Bette Midler fan.
(still quiet) The actress.
Up again?! This is incredible! Im.. Im getting it.
Yes, well, if the other people in the office saw that I called an exterminator, they would just panic. Besides, this is sort of a friendly visit. Carl, right?
I can't drive?
Hey, what are you doing?
yeah, time is what he's indicating there..
(urgent) Mr Wilhelm, listen. You've been abducted! Please, Mr Wilhelm, you gotta listen to me!
'Things'll be great, when you're...'
Oh, that's a dangerous fruit. It's like a weapon that thing, got spikes on the end. You can get killed from one of those things.
I got a job interview. They want to see me this afternoon.
I got some cufflinks I could've loaned you.
What are you talking about?
I can't get a massage from a man.
What about the Coast Guard? Seems like a lot of pride there, a lot of tradition.
(coughs) I've always smoked.
(clears throat) Maura, I, uh- I want you to know... I-I've given this a lot of thought. I'm sorry, but... we, uh, we have to break up.
Yeah, I hope so. For your sake!
Hey Glenn!
Of course.
It was an inferno in there! An inferno! (Eric, Robin's mother, and all the kids rush at George.)
Yeah, well, I guess the only thing I can do is go into George Steinbrenners office and tell him he has to give her a raise.
So I lugged that table. That big heavy massage table all the way down to the cab! You ever seen one of those things?
(talking from bathroom) Witness?
Well, you know Katy, Elaine's friend?
Well I gotta go talk to Beth.
"Hey"
I will, sir. Top priority.
Did I get him in trouble? Because of what I said?! I just told him what happened.. he didn't do it on purpose.. (Mangager and busboy are arguing. The busboy points in the direction of George) He pointed at me. Why did he point at me?!
But this is Pavarotti!
Glad you enjoyed it.
Ah, and I got a date with the sales woman. She's got a little Marisa Tomei thing going on.
Moisturizer?
Yeah, dentist of the stars.
This is like a Penthouse letter...Why can't I meet women like this?
(Runs over to him, not wanting him to leave) What? You're going?
Yeah. I can't get over it.
I'm not her boyfriend. I want to be her boyfriend.
I hate asking for change. They always make a face. Like I'm asking them to donate a kidney.
This guy from my old neighborhood. Lloyd Braun. He's a big advisor to Mayor Dinkins. He thinks he's so cool.
Oh, yeah. Downtown. Definitely.
Who?
Bust of Nelson Rockefeller.
I left three messages. I can't believe this woman. She has sex with me, leaves ten minutes later then I never hear from her again. What kind of a person does this? I mean, she used me. I feel cheap and violated.
Sure. So, uh, Jerry, there's an empty apartment in my building. If you and Hallie want, we could try and hold it, may...
What do you mean?
I told ya. Hey, any of you guys want to come out and help me fix my father's screen door in Queens?
(rage) Oh, it's got cachet, baby! It's got cachet up the yin-yang!
I don't know why Rachel had to drive back with Michael and Carol.
What, are you, nuts? You're gonna spend more on the ticket than you're gonna get back from Grossbard.
You know, the guy from Cheers.
Oooh.
Who says you gotta have a story? Remember when we were waiting for, for that table in that Chinese restaurant that time? That could be a TV show.
All right, I gotta get going. My parents are expecting me.
What are these? (Holds test tubes to his head like antennae) Take me to your leader.
It's George.
Jerry, let's go! You ready?
(surprise) Head of scouting?
You know, when I was a kid, we didn't have these elaborate birthday parties w-with catered food and entertainment. I remember my 7th birthday party...
What are we gonna do? How are we gonna get out of here?
Yeah, my wife couldnt make it today. Shes got something with her mother... Who knows whats going on with her. Dont let any one kid you, its tough.
Ah, enjoying them?
(angry that she believes Al was right) No he's not right. Al Netchie is not right! Alright I'm canceling the father-son picnic. I don't know what he's gonna do with all that potato salad.
Oh, that's funny
I broke 'em playing basketball.
Oh. (he stands there)
I mean, she's beautiful, right? She's just my type. The dark hair, the full lips.
Oh, sorry.
The... drivel... parts. Oh my gosh, I just realized  I have to make a phone call. I-I cant believe- Would you-
Is it? (reaches into bag)
Breath problem?
Well, my father works for the United Volunteers, maybe he can get her one.
. . . Why not?
Where are you goin?
I was going to, but then I found out that the auto club has this free locksmith service, so I signed up. Just waiting for the membership to kick in.
So, anything to uh, nosh?
You know, Lloyd, I-I've been to the doctor (hands George the card) there's really nothing they can do.
(standing) Oh yeah, Reilly? (smugly) Well, the jerk store called. They're running outta you
It's the same movie! What's the difference?
You will?
Same thing. My god, I'm getting married in December, do you know that?
Sure, all right. Tell me the rules.
And everything else has changed. But toilet paper is exactly the same, and will be so until we're dead.
Hey oh.
How many tickets are you paying today?
Yeah. Yeah, one second.
Grass
Hey, there's a guy up the roof.
Behind the dugout, are you kidding? How did you get them?
Alright, just keep the hat!
You see if I stay the whole year, I get it all.
This week. My father got a deal from a friend of his. It's Gore-Tex. You know about Gore-Tex?
I need everything in there.
Could there be a native p0roblem in the Caymans? Maybe theres native unrest.
Nah, I gotta deliver some Christmas presents to my parents.
I don't know, about three days.
I'm family. I'm having sex with the cousin!
Yeah. So, how's Cindy the maid?
I'm sorry I'm sorry, here's the test. Thanks again for doing this - hhe.
Tommy C.
Because it's on TV.
Oh, not more building.
So we started drinking, and I'll tell you I don't know if it was the alcohol or the ammonia, but the next think I knew she was mopping the floor with me.
Uh, yes, uh...you don't know me, my name is George Costanza...did you happen to rent Breakfast At Tiffany's?
$3.49? It says $1.49.
I wonder if, ah, Susan ... (picks up the phone from the coffee table, then decides not to call) No. I better just go. (claps hands) heh. All right! See ya. (grabs his rain coat from the hook by the door and rushes out)
Colin O'Brien.
What?
I am? What a strange coincidence..
We could be zipping all over the place.
A mute would be good.
Yes. Please. Please, let's go.
That's where the electricity comes out.
Well, giddy-up!
Oh, Hey, eh, there's a spot right in front of the liquor store. You see
You have any idea how fast these things deteriorate when there's an 'I love you' out of the bag? You can't have a relationship where one person says, "I love you", and the other says, "I'm hungry. Let's get something to eat.".
Ha, because I love Drakes Coffee Cake.
"Jerry"!
You know, Louise. I think you'll find this amusing. In early Euclidean geometry--
Where did you get that from?
Why? What do you mean?
A table right here.
Like at the airport? (getting excited)
Where are you going?
Beautiful.
So, she went out with you on a first date.. and it was her birthday?
Your boyfriend reads the Daily Worker? What is he? A communist?
We are going to the Knick game! Michael Jordan!
You mean like a bra?
I thought Kramer was watching.
Yeah!
Oh no, I am down!
Ouch!
Aretha! (points finger at Jerry)
I can't believe this.
(animated) Some guy. Some guy? Neil! I have got to find out how he could get a girl like Danielle.
Oh yeah yeah, don't you know they used pastrami in that movie 9? weeks? Remember the pastrami scene?
The story is the foundation of all entertainment. You must have a good story otherwise it's just masturbation.
The one with the long sideburns?
Youre not getting no Drakes Coffee Cake for fifty cents. Yae, Hey, Im all set. I got the ticket. Im going to the Cayman Islands this Friday.
From the bathroom.
Whatever.
Yeah, I'll zip in, "How do you do?", zip out. She'll love me.
Yeah, sure, we met at Jerry Seinfeld's apartment. When you fumigated for fleas over there.
Bring it on!
Kramer was on Murphy Brown?
Hey. You know, do I have a case for you guys to do on L.A. Law.
No, the Portuguese waitress.
Why don't you give me the twenty, and I'll stop and get change, and then you and I can... uh... you-know, settle.
We all got along. Everyone seemed very pleasant.
You see those tears streaming down you don't know what to do. It was like she was on fire and I was trying to put her out.
The Jon Voight car is no more.
Muy sumpatico. Muy muy muy.
Yeah, let him chew on that for a while.
Right. The other members of our party. (closes partition) Other members of our party? What other members of our party? I didn't even know we were in a party. Oh, I'm telling you, the jig is up.
Hey.
It's George.
My car's totaled. It's all his fault and now, he has absolutely no money. There is no way that he can pay me. So the judge decrees that he becomes my butler.
Ya!
Hey.
I have to rewind it first. (George presses the rewind button on the tape recorder. He and Jerry stand there, waiting impatiently as it rewinds.) Alright, alright.
Yeah.
(Frantically, takes phone and screams...) He'll call you back.
I'm making it up.
Is that what's hurting your appreciation for the story?
(entering Monk's) Oh, hello, Hanke, others.
You think the person you were talking to is him? That's not even close to him. He's funny, Jerry's funny.
Well what about all the Lloyd Braun sales?
Will you stop it?
Let me tell you something about that tag. It's no 31, and uh...let's just leave it at that.
Ladies and gentlemen, this (Opens the door, Steven is standing there) is Steven Koren. His G.P.A. is a solid 2.0! Right in that meaty part of the curve - not showing off, not falling behind.
You know what this has to do with?
I havent seen it yet, but its a two-bedroom, its on the uh, west 83rd, bout a half block from the park?
All right.
(happy) Oh! Okay.
I can do six weeks standin' on my head. I'm a sexual camel. That's not the point. At least there was the possibility.
Can I finish?
Wow, is she not terrific?
I can't be blind, Jerry The blind are courageous.
People break up all the time.
All right Mrs. S. I and my good pal Keith Hernandez will be right back.
To ask her out.
Hey, Al. How's it going?
--Astroturf? You know who's responsible for that, don't you?! The Jews! Ah, the Jews hate grass. They always have, they always will.
I'm as good as them.
But I'm paying you!
(quietly) Ya.
And here's a roll that I think you may enjoy.
I just remembered, I gotta be someplace. Yuh-hu-hur, that's enough. Pop. Pop, put down the wrench, Pop.
Laguardia? All right, let's go. C'mon...
What big salad? I'm going to the coffee shop.
Mr. Thomassoulo during times of great stress, people are capable of super human strength. Have you ever seen the Incredible Hulk, sir?
Yes, sir, that was a good sandwich, sir.
(embarrassed with a touch of unrestrained jubilation) Yes.
Who's dressing you? (Laughs) You look like a complete idiot! You know, I wouldn't wipe my- (Unable to take anymore, Leslie gets up and shoves George violently. His hands go straight for the hot iron sitting on the dressing room table. George screams out in agony) AAHHHH!!!!! (his voice is heard outside the building, on the street, and in the park were a bunch of pigeons are scared by the yelling)
Nope! (Starts heading for the door)
I've been to the movies.
Im starving. You got any of those free donuts you use to soften people up?
I have an aunt that died at seven.
Uh, excuse me, Wyck. Uh, are we, uh, almost done here?
That's not funny. So, are you coming to the party?
(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o!
What come on? Have you ever dated a woman that worked in your office?
What's with all the butter?
"Well...there's no room for someone like that in this organization."
Yeah. But it was somebody's arm.
Who's that?
Yeah, Well that's a deal where I come from.
I don't even think she'd notice it. Can you see it?
Good. I think you forgot something.
[quietly] C'mon, go along...
If only she could get fired. Is there any way that could happen? I mean I know how to get myself fired.
I mean, it's not fair. I've been going there for 7 years. She's been there 3 weeks.
(internally) How am I gonna get out of this? Think Costanza, think!
Doing quite well, thank you. Yesterday I had a soft boiled egg and a quickie. You know what? If I could add TV to the equation, that would really be the ultimate.
You said you grabbed it outta there real fast, right?
Oh are they gonna be furious.
I told you, I told you! Ha ha ha! Ooh ooh!
I don't need any ideas. It's a show about nothing.
You know, if I could get this Coco woman down to Kruger, they wouldn't be able to call me Koko anymore because Kruger would never allow 2 Kokos.
All right. Well, we'll see what happens to you.
I mean, you've seen her, right?
Hotel.
A hundred dollars.
Yea, she likes you.
Hey, at least I'm bringing something to this. (Starts flipping through envelopes, reads one ) "Have you seen me?" (Flicks it aside) Nope. (looks at next envelope) Woah, something from Whatley.
It's Moops.
What?
Mrs. Seinfeld?!?
Who's he?
(To himself) Oh my God.
(on the phone) Uh, Mrs. Ross? It's-it's George.
But Mr. Cantwell, you... you owe me for the soup...
(con't) A-Anyway, I was thinking we would take two cars up to the cabin and that way if one of wanted to stay you know...
Wohoo, check it out.
How come?
Well, sir, I - I gave out the fake card, because, um, I don't really celebrate Christmas. I, um, I celebrate Festivus.
Was she uh, was she a big, uh woman?
Nope. I wept like a baby.
Maybe Im right? Of course Im right.
Boy, you look really great.
And that was wrong, Jerry! You simple must to apologize..
...ah (picks up the bag) Damn salami.
...thirty-two, thirty-three-
. . . she scooped her niblets?
Fantastic!
Pouty? I like that.
My code?
OH MY GOD!!!
Come on, Im tired.
Elaine, Elaine, Elaine, Elaine...(distant alarm sound which is getting louder.)
Ya-hah.
Well? (Miranda hits George) I was just - I'm curious, that's all. We, uh. We'd like you to, do everything possible.
(Mr.Wilhelm comes in and hears George yelling) You tell that son of a bitch no Yankee is ever comin' to Houston! Not as long as you bastards are running things!
What, you didn't wash all day?
Nothing. I don't know...just a little dirt.
Yeah, tell im. But quickly, Im double parked here.
What the hell is this?
What happened to Putty?
Maybe Karen is faking.
Elaine, I got to have another picture of Gillian.
You start flirting with him and I'll come by and, while you're keeping him busy, I'll slip it in his drink.
Where's the crazy man, Come on up.
Uh no no, shes working.
Yeah, that's right. It's working.
No, no, no. Just lately, I've been thinking a lot clearer. Like this afternoon, (To television) what is chicken Kiev, (Back to Jerry) I really enjoyed watching a documentary with Louise.
So I'm sure whatever germs it landed on were knocked out, and by the time the rest of them realised what was going on, you had already grabbed it out.
Bert... Har... bin... son. Bert Har-bin-son.
(singing) Master of the House/Quick to catch your eye/Never wants a passerby to pass him by...
How could you be a doctor and not say "get outta here"? It should be part of the training at medical school "Cancer? Get outta here!" "Go home! What are you crazy? It's a little test. It's nothing. You're a real nut. You know that?" (Jerry gives him half of his sandwich to hopefully shut him up) I told you that God would never let me be successful. I never should've written that pilot. Now the show will be a big hit, we'll make millions of dollars, and I'll be dead. Dead Jerry. Because of this. (showing his lip)
Hey, yeah. My parents want to come too, is that ok?
You think she could be an 'it'? Could she be an 'it'?
(getting animated) Look I, I uh, I had nothing to do with this. It wasn't my decision. It was Jerry! Jerry told me no. I'm the creative guy. He handles the business end.
I got rejected by a bald woman. A bald woman rejected me. Heh, you like that one? A woman with no prospects and no *hair*, told me that I wasn't her type. Apparently *baldy* likes a slimmer guy.
Nope.
Ya manufacture it.
I know. The only way to fix it now, is to get a whole new photo of Kruger.
(to Jerry) Whos going to play left field?
What's that.
Here. Let me take your tabe downstairs for you.
Yes. Now take off those pants.
"What day is today?....Aw. ..Tuesday! Damn it. I shouldn't have worked out today. Mr Wilhem has called a big meeting and now I'm gonna be sweating through the whole thing."
Yeah, I slept at my parents' house.
Im nervous.
What kind of hair?
Yeah. Once belonged to Jon Voight.
I didn't have any sex.
I suppose I could just pull this out ( his tucked shirt)and walk around like this and you wouldn't care?
It seems like a problem.
Ya gotta put on a show, ya always gotta give them a big show. You always have to be 'on' otherwise why would they like me? They'd just go for a better looking guy with more money.
Alright, well you know what'cha gotta do, you gotta go through her purse. Y'know, the-the credit cards, driver's license...
"Breakfast At Tiffany's." 90 pages. (Waves a hand like it's nothing.)
He's with the touring company of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. He's the guy in charge of the wigs.
Hey, when you order from the waitress, get her to point to the menu. I want to see what finger she uses.
Hey.
Aw, come on. I wanna go see him.
Absolutely. You just tell him the truth.
Congratulations...congratulations.
Like who?
Umm, Im not. Its just a sociological experiment!
I just talked to Mr. Kruger, he'll be down in a minute. He wanted me to take a photograph for the record.
Well, Marisa. See, the thing is... I'm sort of engaged.
Yes. A male roommate.
Uh, yes, actually we-we both do.
Yeah, Art Vandelay.
The table, the stereo, the VCR, the velvet couch, where's the velvet?
Great.
Oh yes, by no means, the mood. Let me know if there's anything I can do to lend support to the mood.
Birthday card?
Yeah!
Ha, uh,
I need some water. I gotta get some water.
Oh, ... some stupid movie...
What's it gonna be? ... You hear that?
It's just we want you to go.
Wh.. Where you going?
Well, anyway, the book club meets tomorrow, Mr. Temple.
Where are you gettin' a Wizard for fifty dollars?
Hey!
I got another meeting with Reilly. A whole new audience, and I bet I can get him to try that line again.
Don't leave (George slams the door)
I could see that...
Did you ever meet my friend, Simons?
What's with all these people having babies?
Well why didn't we?
Hi honey..
Yes, they are bold. Jerry, what do you think?
What?
There could be more than one O'Brien on a plane who ordered a limo.
(To guard) Tired?
Regardless. I had to walk around for the rest of the party in some cheap Metlife windbreaker. Now, it is payback time.
Oh leave Jack alone. Jack's got enough problems. I'll just take the small office.
He just read it. (Russell vomits again. Jerry and George look ashamed.)
What was that?
Oh, hey, sorry I'm late.
The show! Forget about the show! We should take the idea to a different network
(whispering) I can't explain. It's very important that I sit here.
You didn't get one?
No, I didn't.
Well, it doesn't even have to be the general manager. Maybe I could be like, an announcer. Like a color man. You know how I always make those interesting comments during the game.
Well I was lost, I never saw the first one. By the way, you mind if I watch it here?
So the Wig master.......the Wig master said you could stop by the theater tonight.. and he'll show you around.
Oh, uh, "The Falconer" by John Cheever. It's really excellent.
Yeah, how did you know that?
So, that's it. All of my darkest fears, and... everything I'm capable of. That's me.
This is great!
Nine minutes.
Ok, so, what'dya got?
Yeah.
Really?
(Reading) I see here that you play the harp.. tell me, why do you have to tilt it? Can't you just build it on an angle? It'd save you a lot of trouble.
No, I-I-I-I'm good. Really.
(Letting his conscious get the best of him) I wonder how Susan's father's going to react to this. Alright, what- what's the worst he could do? So you burn a cabin down..
I wanna know what I did to this woman.
(still pleased) She doesn't know that. We say that you do.
I didnt know there was a fireplace.
No problem.
I'm going.
I don't know what Newman wanted to see me for.
Uh-hmm.
I got it. You wanna get her something nice? How 'bout a music box?
And Elaine is gonna keep him busy.
You spritz a little Lysol on it.
Alright, alright! We'll buy her a wheelchair! Wheelchairs, engagement presents.. IT NEVER ENDS!
Of course. Absolute zero!
So you don't speak *any* English at all?
Come on 'Oh George, oh Geeeooorge!' Come on! Not that I don't appreciate the effort that was put into it.
Yes.
Yeah, it bothers me. Doesn't it bother you?
What, you don't think I can attract beautiful, intelligent women?
Really?
What, wha, what're you talkin' about?
I believe the doors on the bathroom stalls, here at the stadium, don't offer much by way of privacy. But I was thinking if we extend the doors all the way to the floors......
(on phone  calling secretary) Hello Margery, George Costanza. How are you sweet heart? Listen, can you give Mr. Thomassoulo a message for me? Yes. If he needs me, tell him (screams) IM IN MY OFFICE! Thanks.
What do the Chinese have to gain by faking a cure for baldness?
It's all pipes! What's the difference?!
Ah, come on
yes?
(knocks on the window) Hey, why are all those people milling around my car?
Did she show her breasts in that?
You should see what my father used to go through before he bought a car. He'd go from state to state. He was away for weeks at a time. It was like he was running for President and he was going through the primaries. We'd get phone calls from motels in New Hampshire.
Celia's up for parole.
Ya know, I was just a little surprised.
I'm all for awkward pauses. Fix me up with her.. Wait a minute, Nina just saw me in my Timberlands! Now I have to wear them every time I see her.
But you have a watch on.
Pssh. Would the protg pick up stuff for the mentor?
Yes, I am familiar with this syndrome -- she's a two-face.
Really? (Jerry nods his head) Well, what if it doesnt stop? Oh, that I really needed to hear. That helps a lot! All right, just say something. Just start talking. Change the subject. Lets just go, All right? I cant believe were having dinner with Alton Benes.
What is this? The marble rye?
Tragic.
Is that so? Or could it be that you're just a *little* bit worried that you may have missed the boat?
He's right. never.
uh, Uh, Vandelay Industries, is uh. 129 West 81st street. It's a very small industry Vandelay. It's one of the reasons I wanted to uh, work for them.
What is that? Is that cashmere?
Alright, now the play is tomorrow night. So do you want to have dinner first, or do you just want to meet at the theatre?
Kramer!
Feels right. (cheerfully takes another bite)
What? Did you get the busboy's number?
What about this weekend?
(sitting) So, guess where Mr 'Ocean phoned' turned up? He's working for Firestone, in Akron, Ohio.
I learned a lot about myself.
Of course, right.
Very nice
Really? Wow, you're quite the good son.
We sat there for twenty minutes, chewing, staring at each other in a defunct relationship.
(desperate) Steinbrenner had me committed! I'm in the nuthouse!
(Gets up, stopping him) Woah, woah, woah! What are you telling me for? You really had me going, there! C'mon, sit down. (They both sit back down) What do you want to do when you grow up?
(Offering) Drink?
I wouldn't hear of it, Todd. It's none of my business. But you should try to find out everything you possibly can. In fact, I'll even stay all the way on the other side of the room just so there's no chance of me overhearing anything.
(we hear him think) My friends are idiots, she doesn't look like Jerry. She doesn't look like anybody. And so what if does look like Jerry,what does that mean?. That I could have everything I have with Jerry but because it's a woman I could also have sex with her....And that somehow that would be exactly what I always wanted.....She doesn't even look like Jerry..
(On his way out) Heh, heh, heh. Thats what they want you to think.
Well... it's a magnificent stone.
The weather guy, Dr. Waldo.
I'm unbelievable at spelling last names. Give me a last name.
Of Course I'm telling the truth.
Medium turkey chili.
Jerry Seinfeld. My best friend. He can explain all of this. (calls to Jerry) Jerry.
I uh, took care of that.
Yes. Live, dammit. Live! Every precious moment as if this was the last year of your life. Because in many ways...it is. (There's a knock at the door.) Excuse me.
Yeah, go ahead, call.
No. I wouldnt even have to tell her. I could surprise her.
You wanted to see me, Mr.Steinbrenner?
No, no, Hey I'll get it. What's in the BIG salad?
I don't know. Perhaps I can better serve the world this way.
(scoffs) Those unions. (sighs) Okay. Sports,...movies. What about a talk show host?
All right?
(upset) Could you put a little thought into this? Jerry's gone, you could humour me. He humours me.
This is by far the most exciting thing I've ever done.
Excuse me, I'm sorry to bother you, I noticed that you have a textbook on tape. May I ask where you got that?
You think she thinks I have a beautiful face, or is she just saying that?
Yeah, I told her how toilet paper hasn't changed in my lifetime, and probably wouldn't change in the next fifty thousand years and she was fascinated, fascinated!
Hey, Cosmo what happened to your mother last night. She hung me out to dry.
(Quickly making it up) Well, possibly. I wrote an off-Broadway show, "La Cocina." ..Actually, it was off-off-Broadway. It was a comedy about a Mexican chef.
He's getting phone calls here now? (he's standing near the counter and eating chips out of a big bag)
(modest) And I'm a little tired.
...she calls me up at my office
Black and white?
Ho, ha, ho! Jerry Seinfeld's a funny guy!
Is there any work being done? Is there any rubbing, touching, finger manipulation on the other person, and if so, who's making the request?
How could you not know her name?
The second time I sent the noodles back, I tought she made a face...
Yeah my parents have it. Sometimes it skips a generation.
What do you mean?
Hey, do you know, Bonnie, I just had a pretty wild idea.
Well it's not my fault. Seinfeld can't drive. How hard is it to follow somebody?
Hey, you bastards.
Alright, but no later, because my parents are coming back.
I hope so. I can't take him living with me much longer. He makes this kasha, it stinks up the whole house.
Very good. Go on.
Because... you know...
She is succinct.
You know, anything in the, in the lip area is good.
Give me your key, I gotta get it.
(shocked) What?
Does the heater even work in this car?
Kramer, what's the name of the store with the mannequin?
What?
Oh-ho, yeah?
Yeah. One second sweetheart. Jerry, I really think it'd be easier if you didn't tuck.
My parents? They don't know *what's* goin' on...
Tryptophan.* (*footnote - see end of script)
What is this? Did you ever get the feeling like you've had a haircut but you didn't have one? I'm all itchy back here.
All right. I don't.
(clears his throat)
This hat just bottles in the heat, I -I don't even need a coat! It's unbelievable!
Now, I'm aware that my own physical dimensions are perhaps a little short of perfection.
He left... huh... Carl, you hungry?
If she doesnt show up, we cant possibly have dinner with him alone.
Alright, alright, but no funny business, same deal as last night.
Ooh yeah, the bags, sure.
(on the phone) Oh my God.
Yes, I have a problem with paba.
During that period when my folks were separated he went a little crazy.
Jay Crespi, how am I gonna forget Jay Crespi?
What are we gonna tell her?
Elaine, I'm, I'm shocked. I'm shocked. Here I go out in the spirit of the season (Elaine looking like she's not buying a word of it) and spend all my savings to buy you the most beautiful Christmas sweater I have ever seen to show my appreciation to you at Christmas and this is the thanks that I get at Christmas.
Hello everybody.
(cuts into Jerry talking) Chocolate chip mint? Oh well, actually Jerry I prefer chocolate chip. What is it about the chocolate and the mint that makes it go so well together?
Well, you're gonna have to go to the bathroom!
...Are you sure?
Alright, I just have to go over to the Ross' apartment and drop off Susan's sunglasses. You'll come with me?
Well, I still think you shoulda told me.
Well don't let him take advantage of you like that.
I am not putting it in a garage, it's my space.
Yeah, the oceans really are getting very sudsy.
Mulva! (again pointing finger at Jerry -- Kramer watches the exchange back and forth)
he he (laughs)
Yeah, he's something, isn't he?
Im starving! I can feel my stomach sucking up against my spine.
A backup system? We're designing bathroom doors with our legs exposed in anticipation of the locks not working? That's not a system. That's a complete breakdown of the system.
If only something like that could happen to me.
No, no, no, I dont want to carry it around all night. Ill pick it up later.
(frustrated) Oh, look at this. There's no place to park around here. I don't even know why they sell cars in Manhattan.
Did I need that pointed out for me? What is that going to do for me? How does that help me, to see her? I'm trying to live my life. Don't show me that.
Wait, wait. Here me out. Don't dismiss this. You're very quick to dismiss. Don't dismiss. She's got a big crush on David Letterman, I mean, a big crush. She talks about him all the time. Suppose I go up to David Letterman. He works at NBC; I work at NBC. I explain my situation. He agrees to meet her. They go out, they fall madly in love. And she dumps me for David Letterman.
(in the threshold between the living room and the kitchen) The thing that bothers me the most, is the lying.
$2? But everyone in front of me got free bread.
Of course you do, but youre imagining a guy you like, not a guy who goes, Oh no, I dont drink coffee late at night. If I call her now, shes gonna think Im too needy. Women dont wanna see need. They want a take-charge guy  a colonel, a Kaiser, a tsar.
No, you're crushing my sandwich.
In this scene my co-star who's right over here ( goes over to George who is still on the phone) Follow meeeee... is George Costanza, he plays an airline pilot who's just returned from Rome and I'm about to show him how much I've missed him.
Oh, come on.
No but say hello for me.
He dropped it.
Couldnt be better.
You're friends with Marisa Tomei?
I gave. I gave everything I could Mrs. Sokol. but nothing was good enough for her.
(Standing up, still waking up) Alright, you know what we should do? We should go to the movies. Get away from this script for a while..
So how do you want to do this?
Sweet guy (Receives the phone from Beth, Starts to talk to Jerry) Hello
Everybody's doing something, we'll do nothing.
Uh, let me ask you a question. Could you, uh, expand the space underneath a desk to give it a little more headroom?
(Slowly backing away, he's not at all committed to the conversation) Yeah.. television.
Cause its signals, Jerry, its signals! (snapping his fingers) Dont you- all right. Did she even ask you, what you were doin tomorrow night, if you were busy?
(still puffing)" Whoa!!"
It wasn't down in, it was sort of on top.
(shaking his head, weary) It doesn't matter. (he leaves)
Come on!
I think I was affected by the caffeine.
(CONT'D) ...with that group.
I see, well, thats open to interpretation. Because so much depends on the layering and the quality of the wetness in the eyes.
Discovered a cure for baldness.
Exactly! You know how they get animals to reproduce in captivity? They just put them in the same cage.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
Huh-ho! Oh! You are too much, Mr. Kruger! Too much!
So we pick up some (word missing)
I don't think we should. We really don't know each other very well.
(Places the doll presumingly where it belongs on a shelf) Ya?
Alright, what are we getting? It's hot in here!
Ok uh, I guess I'll tell them that.
No, of course not.
You wouldnt believe it. Rasputin.
Above the rim.
Why did you even take it? You broke up with her!
Uh Jerry, how long will you be in there?
I just wanted to tell you that I really enjoyed Fair Game. I thought it was just brilliant.
And who's responsible for making hate mongering and fascism popular again?
You know, my arm feels a lot better. That Wendy really knows her stuff. (he writes out a cheque)
Maybe he's just "very well RED"?
We're not stealing it.
What?
Susan, Susan would you wai,....
...you'll see, things will be different now - if you just give me one more chance.
Oh, so it backfired?
Anyway, right in the middle, the ship blows up-- burning debris, bodies falling-- and then just as this eerie silence settles over the airfield, I yelled out, "That's gotta hurt!"
Ow! .. Ow! I give, I give! Uncle!
Oh, no, no, not at all. No, I have always felt that the most important thing in the world is spending time with family.
Jerry, I've been preparing for this moment my entire life.
No, I dont want it. I want it, if you dont want it.
Elaine, you have to sleep with me.
I know.
S-Susan
(on phone) . It's George Costanza. . are there any messages for me? Why does Mr. Steinbrenner want to see me in his office? . . . Communist? I'm not a Communist . . . . All right, all right. All right, I'll be there. - ( hangs up ) My secretary Ada, told Mr Steinbrenner I'm a Communist Now he wants to see me in his office.
No, no,
No.
No, her too. And her mother.
Ta _ mal _ e!
Oh sure, sure. You wanna be alone, sure. I understand that, you wanna a little time to think uh thing..ponder things..you know..ruminant..(chuckles) you go ahead, lotta stuff on your mind..you think things out..Think, mull, mull, do a lot of mulling. (short laugh then exits Monk's)
Well, you know, book reports. That kind of stuff.
Hey uh let me take you're coat.
Kramer, don't be fooling around up here.
She comes out of the bathroom, I'm in up to my wrist. You should have seen the look on her face.
Oh, well th-that's great. It's really great. Hm hm mm.
I'm going to a poetry reading with PATRICE First time poets, in a burnt out building, down by the docks, Supposed to be good.
I mean, batteries have gone dead before, aren't they prepared for that?
You wanted to see me, sir?
I mean, big would even be ok, a little beyond big.
(reluctant) Oh that uh, that seems like a lotta trouble.
Pull it up a little bit.
No, Jerry, don't call.
What?
Well you know, if you were sitting right next to her you'd have to console her no matter what.
Oh, its a great place, its uh two-bedroom uh, west 83rd bout half block from the park.
Why didn't you say something then?
Heads!
They're for protection, Jerry. Can you tell where I'm lookin'?
Boy, it stings.
Hehehe. .(feebly)
Oh, my God! My *MOTHER*!!!
Liam Neeson. You know, he's not American.
What about all the loser stuff?
She's not out there!
And now?
Right, ready?
All right, I think they have fleas there. So what...
Yes, In fact, her mother is in the hospital right now. It's some kind of a Diverticulitis. (he continues walking slowly towards Steinbrenners desk)
Ah! There's mom, there's mom.
I tought I saw a face.
Dad, you really should lay off the 'serenity now' stuff.
...Huh!
I told her I liked her. Why? Why did I tell her I like her? I have this sick compulsion to tell women how I feel. I like you I dont tell you.
I don't know, what do women say?
Would I have had access to that?
No, tell me.
Would a giant rubber ball work?
Id like to have a kid. Of course, you have to have a date first... Remember my friend, Adam, from Detroit?
I can't tell ya how much I appreciate this.
Hey! What is your problem?
Doesn't she have collision?
Joe...
Okay. Hey, you know what, maybe I should give it to my therapist to read. She's smart, I trust her.
Smoking.
Maybe she could like me? Is it that far fetched? Maybe she sees something? Is it possible?
I just got here. My car broke down on the Belt Parkway.
Y'know... I could hear you on the other line...
Don't look around. Don't look around. That's what he wants.
Well, I'm still here. You took out the other guy!
Kramer, Kramer, I need to know if Nina is refunding.
Well what if she calls me? What am I supposed to say?! (hand hits the table)
So, what did she say?
Think I'M not?
The network executive. You think she liked me?
What are you talking about? (Jerry grins) You're not!
Oh yeah, but that has nothing to do with it.
I got to go after her.
Aw, Mr. Kruger, Sir. Merry Christmas! (Hands him a card)
Hey.
She invited me up. Coffees not coffee, coffee is sex.
I know!
Big hefty stinking faux pas.
What's the difference you just read it and mail it right back. These we'll do.
Hey Elaine? Put me down for some of that art. 1,900 dollars worth.
No, no, no. Out of the question. I was over there today. He's got the good spot in front of the good building in the good neighbourhood. I know he's not gonna wanna move.
Okay. (Chewing) Thanks anyway. (Continues to chew as he exits)
I spilled some Chardonnay. So, what did you get?
You really think so?
Yeah.
Tell him to open it.
No, I brought a picture of the chair.
... so glad.
So, they didn't give you a piece of cake? Big deal.
Oh... do I have to write him a note or something?
So now, the father is screaming at me, he's demanding that I pay for the boom box. Finally, I gave them a fake address and got the hell out of there.
Uhm...Id like to ask you...ask you to analyze a hypothetical phone call, you know, from a female point of view.
I must have dripped some on the floor and I slipped and...
How do you know? What if pig-man had a two-seater?
Alright! So, she said, that she could've fixed me up with her.
(waving apologetically) Not you.
May I help you?
Well, just tell Kramer to tell her.
(agitated) Alright, I gotta try and talk my mother into taking him off my hands.
Hey.
All right, I've got to go down to the unemployment office. Wanna take a walk?
What am I scared of? I'm scared of the same thing that you are, everything! Why don't you just use your own name?
Oh, please ... ... four dollars is f...
Nooooo.
I mean, I could understand if there was something else playing, but it's this or nothing.
No, what?
You know she was behind the idea. She was going to champion the show. That's what I was bring her up there to tell you. And she liked me.
The busboy's coming?
She's working late that night. We're - were supposed to have dinner with everybody at eight o'clock so I'll set up the ride for seven o'clock.
(Studying the salt shaker) I'm not taking a civil service test.
Allllll right!
(Interested) I should!
So, is he okay?
No kidding?
Is he a clown? What, are you kidding me!?
All right. I'm gonna try givin' them fifty-five dollars each... (to Elaine) What do you think?
You got isobutane-30?
No way.
Yeah, I'm a great quitter. It's one of the few things I do well. I come form a long line of quitters. My father was a quitter, my grandfather was a quitter... I was raised to give up.
Why would we want to help somebody?
Kramer, listen to me. I'm never gonna have a child. If I lose this Frogger high score, that's it for me.
No, but I can tell she's going to. I can sense it. We had this terrible phone conversation. I was so nervous before I called I made up this whole list of things to talk about.
She's been locked up for two years. She's gonna want to make up for lost time. Dinners. Movies. (Rubs his forehead.) Talking...
(amused) You're supposed to do that?
N.I. Not interested.
Oh, you are such a wuss.
No Don't get the camera , we don't need the camera. Listen I know your skeptical , but I really believe in the Chinese.
Manhattan Memorial, less of a line.
I show up. I pretend I have the job. The guy's on vacation. If I have the job, it's fine. If I don't have the job, by the time he comes back, I'm ensconced.
I don't know.
Hey, she wants me to dress uh "smart casual." What uh, what is that?
What's to think about? If Putty says it's what it is, it's what it is. He's not gonna cheat you.
He's coming up?! (Moves to the door) I'll check you out later.
Give me the phone. (dials) Yea, Hi I would like to speak to Patrice. ... what? ... oh really? ... oh, ok, thank you, ... (hangs up)
Don't you believe me? It's their fiftieth anniversary. You know this is gonna kill him. You're aware of that. Kill him. On the biggest night of his life...
No, thanks.
(Sarcastic) Yeah, yeah. I'm gonna move in with him. He doesn't even let you use the toilet!
MOOPS
Haven't you kissed her?
I had to say something. (chuckles) I had to say something. Everything was going so well. I had to say something.
Oh, thats great. Thats great. By the way I have to apologize for my friend the other day. Friend? Uh, uh I dont even know that woman. I met her on the bus on the way over. I couldnt get rid of her. Uh, My psychic instincts were a little off ..
(mildly embarrassed) yeah.. Thank you.
Would you stop that? It's not safe to be jumping up and down on a plane.
Vinyl yeah, maybe.
Yeah, well....
What you talking about?
I know, I know, thats what they said.
(sarcastically) Thats funny. Youre a funny guy.
You know, I don't see how you can sit there eating that and not even offer me any?
No-no Jerry. I wouldn't do that.
Great. (They both stand.) Oh, by the way, did you get a chance to read the script?
I don't even like to use urinals, always been a stall man.
No, we're not. We're not men.
Goldfish.
Really?
I don't understand. Paper Machay hats?
You never should have taken away his keys!
So, you send me to this therapist to help me with my emotional disorders, and she criticizes our script. (Tosses the script to Jerry.) What kind of a therapist is that?
(quiet, desperate) Maybe she can get me another picture of man-hands. (calling) Elaine!
(Trying to keep his voice down) I think you've done a lot more than talk! You betrayed me!
Yeah. I'll pay for it.
Why? Because we're a team! C'mon! Would you take this for us, dear? Thank you very much. Here we go... (To Morgan) Anyone ever tell you you look a lot like Sugar Ray Leonard? Yeah, you must get that all the time.
Morning, ma.
Alrighty, so. That's one tuck and one no-tuck. Got that?
Never mind!
(holds eyes wide open) Get it back!
What about it?
Let me show you something, take a look at this... (Another guy at the party interrupts.)
Yeah, phew.
Well, if she keeps horsing around with that tractor--
Who's Sid?
So countries just exchange gifts like that?
Okay, the point is made.
Now, fellas, fellas.. easy. You wouldn't want to beat up on one of your own.
"I have to go see Steinbrenner later. Mr Wilhelm told him that I was the one responsable for stealing all the merchandise."
I didn't know whether to try and keep her from falling, or zip up.
(from the intercom) Yeah.
The locker room!
You think it's something?
Oh thank you.
so, uh, Steven.. I see you're president of the chess club.
(to himself) A cane. I knew it. (to Neil) So, we meet at last. I admire your skills, Mr Peanut.
I dont know how you put up with this.
So.....She's dead?
Really?
How good looking?
I'm positive I gave you a twenty.
You told David Putty your move and you didn't tell *me*? I *need* a move. You know I have no moves, Jerry. (points to the candy bar) Gimme a bite.
I've gotta go to the bathroom.
I just don't like the idea that any time theres a dinner invitation there's this annoying little chore that goes along with it.
You're Murphy!
Yeah, well I'm thinking about getting out of town with Susan for a few days....Her parents rebuilt the cabin!
(urgent) No! Check! (quieter) Please.
No.
Somebody double parked and blocked us in. D-DOES ANYBODY KNOW WHOSE CAR THAT IS? Maybe there's a note on it. Ohh-oh brother. No, no note. Can you believe this?
I can't tell anymore.
That's an interesting question.
I don't know how you can let this guy handle all your money.
Because ballpark food doesn't count as real food.
I'm gonna get a Chow Fung.
Yes, he's a clown!
Yeah, what the hell?!
(worried) Why not?
Yeah.
Well, after dinner last week, she invites me back to her apartment.
Must be hell living in that house.
What's goin'on?
I said 'God bless you'. Was that so wrong?
(moody) Great! Now she's sour!
Alright, c'mon, scooch over. (Tries to squeeze into the corner seat of the couch and struggles with Remy. He spills his glass of grape juice all over the couch in the process.)
(George puts on the headphones) Oh! my god...
So?
And isn't it more fun using the urinal?
Hey, hey, hey!
Alright, I gotta go. I'm heading over to Bonnie's.
(Modest) Oh, thank you very much. (Chuckles)
What was that line again? Something about finding your way in a shadow?
(to Jerry) Well, what d'you think?
What choice do I have?
Like if she wants to know if I'm pleased with something, she'll say, "Happy, Pappy?"
There was an incident. I'd rather not discuss it.
(to Mickey) Can't you just switch with another Midget?
Well, that was bound to happen.
Time?
(suspicious) You didn't say hello?
I can't take it anymore! I'm going to work! ARe you happy now?! (Gathers his things, and runs out of the coffee shop. Elaine and Jerry laugh hysterically)
Yeah.
So? Movie tonight?
Jose Jimenez, ... verrry funny. ..very funny.
You miss her, don't you?
Yes.
(To Kramer) You want to start?
UH, ha ha, ... It's just SO frustrating. It's a brand new jacket.
It's George
Hey, what's your guy's name again?
Ross'.
What does she need? Maybe there's something that she needs.
That's what they tell me!
Ya and also I'm afraid that people in that state are finally going to tell me what they really think of me. You know they got nothing to lose what do they care?
You-you sure you never slept with her? (Jerry shakes his head 'no') Perfect.
It's a foreign movie... a *film*, is what it is, actually.
Well, it's kind of a mystery, isn't it?
Sorry, we're a little late. We got so hung up in traffic.
God, I'm starved, I'm weak from hunger.
Well I can't now, Gwen's going to be there.
Because if there's any doubt at all I...I feel we should cultivate it.
What do you mean?
You don't tell him?
Every day she comes in, she sits at that table and reads. Never talks to anybody.
That's true, that always happens to me.
If you had like five chickens could you tell them apart by just the way they acted? Or would they all just be walking around? Bak, bak, baak, bak? Cause if they have individual personalities Im not sure we should be eaten `em. What's the matter with you?
I kept looking at her face. Id go, Cmon, love her. Love her!
Yep. I'm leaving first thing tomorrow morning.
They're selling coffee, bran muffins.. you're surrounded by reading material. It's entrapment!
We ordered the wedding invitations today,, Nothing can stop it now. Nothing. It's here! It's happening. Can I do this? I can't do this...Look at me. Look at me I can't do this, I can't do this (manic) Help me Jerry, help me.
So what're you gonna do?
No.
Cleaning
I...I...write a letter and then I..I go to China. I disappear in a sea of people for like six months, a year you know just while things simmer down. Ehm.. Ehm...Dear Susan. I'm sorry. I made a terrible mistake. I'm really , really sorry.
I just popped in now. I'm a big pop-in guy.
It's all your fault! You and Elaine! All that orgasm talk. She did have an orgasm, she didn't have an orgasm. Orgasm this, orgasm that. I got so focused on it. I started to panic and boom, I lost it. I tried everything, I was talking to him 'Please wake up, do something.'
(To Jerry) Jerk off.
Oh, no, no. Twix is the only candy with the cookie crunch.
SHEILA!!!
Yes, it is exciting! All right, this is gonna be my new face.
Yeah. (Noticing this makes him out to be the bad kid, he gets defensive) Well, I couldn't run over there the way I was!
Yeah. Eric the Clown put it out with his big shoe.
Look, I'm gonna go to the bathroom...
(shout) Marisa Tomei!
You don't care for Soda?!
Excuse me. Can I talk to you for a second there, Watkins?
Yeah, maybe. (snifs)Where'd you get that?
Top priority.
Yeah.
I don't even know her sister but believe me, if she's getting traffic tickets, she's not that good-looking! Woah
Please. (sits again)
(Looking at her nose) Is your nose pierced?
Been there, done that.
Oh my God.
Yeah. I'm Buck Naked.
(innocent) What?
"Why would George steal from the Yankees?"
That's exactly my point.
Why? Maybe she liked me. I, I mean she was looking right at me. You know, I think she was impressed. You know, we had good eye contact the whole meeting.
Need to use the phone.
I didnt say any other bawdy things.
(not expecting the statue to be thrown) Dit.
Great. Seven-thirty, alright?
No, I-I-I know... [retreats back to his Chinese take out] I know...
Yeah.
Well, I didn't want to break our date.
I don't know....hmmm ha! here's the doctor.
Good.
So you think she likes me?
So what? Ill start talking to him, you know, casual, and Ill work my way around to it.
Holly.
Don't go. Kramer! Come back. I got great news. Well, I did it.
(sniffing) Hmm. Game hen?
Yeah.
I'm really serious. I think that's a good idea.
By the way, you owe me seven fifty.
Its not easy.
Well, why didn't they ask me?
Mine too.
He forced me to!
Oh, come on. What, are you kidding? GEORGE I'm much more comfortable criticizing people behind there backs. Anyway, look who's talking. You just broke up with with Melanie last week because she "shuushed you" while you were watching TV.
(to Jimmy) Wh...Where d'you get'em?"
Are you through?
Shake his hand?
Oh, he'll be here. By the way, Elaine, (reaches under the table and brings out a large coffee machine) thank you for laying out for the Arabian mocha java.
Till I'm comfortable.
(angry, to himself) The ocean called. Running outta shrimp. Outta shrimp! (a thought occurs) Oh! Yes! That's what I shoulda said! (frustrated shout) Dammit!
No.
Peter Jennings had one.
Well you should have been O'Brien.
Jerry, let's face it, I've always been handicapped. I'm just now getting the recognition for it. Name one thing I have that puts me in a position of advantage. Huh? There was a guy that worked at the Yankees-- no arms! He got more work done than I did, made more money, had a wife, a family, drove a better car than I did.
I love the chop sticks. I, I personally prefer a fork but they look very nice.
(Changing subject) Hey, I htink I may have found someone for the scholarship.
Oh, those, those aren't my keys.
Yeah, me either.
So, I'm gonna steal another one, and then return it. That way, everything is even.
[as if the word were totally foreign] My `stub'?
tsh (snorts) Ah, yeah, we've - we've talked . . . I believe I can speak for the both of us on this.
Sorry I'm late, but look what I found in the Yankee Hall of Pride display case.
Yes but then everything is all pulled down and it's jus.. Anyway. The damage, unfortunately, has marred an otherwise fine automobile, rendering it virtually undriveable.
Oh! my God!!......You?.....You?...That was you?....
Who said that?
All right, Dad, we're five blocks from the house. Sit sideways.
Oh, me, me, me, me, me!
If you go now, I know what's gonna happen. We'll find the car, Jerry will show up, and then we'll never find you.
No, I'm gonna hold it under her nose so she can smell the scent of stale Bosco that I had to live with for three years, and I'm gonna say, "Remember this shirt, baby?! Well, now, it's payback time!"
Oh, yeah. You wish you had this coat.
Now if you will kindly help me unwedge my front wheel, I'll be on my way.
(Breathing deeply) That's very dirty. (Jerry nods) That's absolutely filthy.
No, no, I don't think I'm special. My mother always said I'm not special.
Well if Houdini couldn't do it, what chance do I have?
All right. It's grovel time.
Alright, what's the difference. What are we gonna do now? He won't take our calls, we can't get into his office...
What?
All right, all right ( Goes to the bathroom)
No I, I want it if you dont want it.
Yeah. Hey, wait a second, you know, good news for you too. Susan's best friend, Hallie? Broke up with her boyfriend.
(Gloating) Hey, you got any extra furniture down there? I need some more stuff to fill that extra bedroom with the walk-in closet. (Smiles)
Oh now you're gonna go? ELAINE I'll be back in five minutes.
It's a big region.
Okay. "Breakfast At Tiffany's." (Begins to read, but gradually his attention is drawn to the TV Guide on the end table. George realizes there's a show on he wants to see by looking at his watch, and doesn't start the book.)
Where is he?
I find the soothing pastorial images very conduc-
You know, I cant believe youre even considering not playing. We need you. Youre hitting everything.
Yeah, had some coffee, yeah.
What was that?
What a fascinating turn of events. (Waitress approaches)
What's your name?
You know that coat was Gore-Tex. Its worth a hell of a lot more than that, cheap Chardonnay.
Can you believe that guy?
What are you gonna do with all of them?
Yeah. You've heard of it?
Right. So I call her up, I tell her its me, she gives me an enthusiastic Hi!
Eighty-six, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, ninety, ninety-one... Yup.
I told her the truth.
Oh, I love full lips. Something you can really put the lipstick on.
Yep. And it didn't take very long either.
I'm not gonna be nice. That's how I got the job.
They're cuffing him.
(Stern, trying to shut her up) Ma.
Oh, the big race.
Oh no no no. He's deeply in love, and I was just about to break up with her when she told me.
Hey, Jerry, remember Frogger? I used to be so into this game. Gettin' that frog across the street was my entire life.
A what?
Well I would eat you.
No.
Wait a minute. (astonished) You're thinking of moving to Florida again?!
What could I do? Did you see the mug on that kid?
Now, stop it ...
I am not O'Brien! I am not O'Brien! I'm not O'Brien! Ask anyone! Jerry?! Jerry?!!
Can't we just fix the old one?
Where did you get those?
What?
I cant believe what Im hearing.
Well, aren't you something?
(Standing up) I just got here, Ma! I'd like to spend a little time with you.
Hello.
Can we go now?
The plane's been re-routed *back* to Kennedy. We've got 45 minutes.
Get out!! (Jerry gets out and George drives away. A couple of guys notice Jerry in his cowboy boots.)
You're going back to New York now?
Someone's have to unhook the boat before it leaves...the place!
Really? What happened?
Yeah.
There's no G-bone.
Alright, let's just examine the situation for a second. Who, in this situation, would be more likely to make a mistake? Me, who had access to my wallet, knew exactly what was in there? Or you--
Ripe. Boy, this Joe's got some terrific fruit.
(tasting the wine) Excellent. Like I really know what I'm talking about.
Yeah, I thought I might give her a call. I, I don't meet that many women. I meet like three women a year. I mean, we've been introduced. She knows my name.
Well not really...
When did you leave the message?
Yeah, they're all through ruining my life. What the hell are they still doing here? Lemme see this pamphlet. Hm. All right, so I'll, uh, get back to you.
I'm cold too. At least you've got a coat. Let's get in the car.
You know what? I think this Ruthie Cohen gave me the wrong change. Didn't I pay with a twenty? I'm sure I paid with a twenty.
Damn it!
Oh, the guy's got some perspective there.
Nah.
Yo, dad. This is my boss, Mr. Kruger.
(annoyed) Good for the tuna.
Super Savers? Are they refundable!?
Have you seen the new addition to the Guggenheim?
Yes, because the water was cold... and the chewing warms me up.
(Getting up) Alright, Ma, that's enough!
Well...Susan.
Not possible.
Help, someone. (BUBBLE BOY is strangling George)
This'll only take a second.
You know, all these years, I've always wanted to see the two of you get back together.
(shouts) Of course there's something wrong! (points at Jerry) We had a pact!
The security guard.
What are we gonna tell Jerry about the car?
Cut it. (goes back to the group) (Yelling) Would you stop signing?
Well, what is that? That's a crime! Do you know how hot those things get? They should be wearing cotton.
Oh, this is all locking in now. It is all locking in! (laughing)
I thought he was just gonna have a muffin.
Alright that's it. (George walks across the room over to them.) So you get rid of me and now the two of you are going to sleep together?
Kramer was supposed to tie a knot
*Really*.
March 21st. Hey! So, you're gonna back me on this, right?
I'm just gonna...wash. (George walks to the bathroom; screaming) WHY DID I PUT UP TWO? WHY DID I PUT UP TWO?
Hi.
Well, you're not gonna believe what happened.
Nothing, I... said it was a little problem.
Like what?
Yeah, the tenant association has decided to hear my side of the story. So, uh, I gotta kinda get ready. I'll see ya.
I had a little tiff with Bonnie about the roommate.
Oh, see? that's why I don't have cable in my house. Because of that naked station. If I had that in my house, I would never turn it off. I wouldn't sleep, I wouldn't eat. Eventually, firemen would have to break through the door, they'd find me sitting there in my pajamas with drool coming down my face. All right, all right. So you're watching the naked station.
It's supposed to be a good party.
I tell ya, I am hooked on these books on tape.
For my hamstring.
They're -- They're killing independent George! And they're, they're all in on it! World's are colliding!
Did you happen to notice that Julie handed the big salad to Elaine?
Oh, yeah. I read what you said to the papers yesterday. You weren't in on the planing. What planning? YOU THINK WE PLANED THIS? Uh?
Hey, Tim. Quick question. Is it normal for your teeth to make noises, like a hissing or a chirping?
Yeah, he's in my bed. I'm sleeping on the couch.
Man, would I like to see the look on his face.
(pause) Dad! I heard you were in the city the other day!
Is it?
That's right.
Whoop! Too late. I think he picked up the scent.
I'm not following.
(to Elaine) Do you want us to go with you?
Jerry, what do you, you wanna, you wanna see the place or not?
But I know who took the bite. It was her aunt!
So, uh, gentlemen, do we have a deal?
Alright, I'll tell you what you do. You call her back and give her the "it's me", heh? Pull the old switcheroo.
That's right.
Oh no I'm in already come on.
Hey.
Chunnel ?
Well, it's a good looking piece of meat. (laughs nervously) Wow, this is some place. A duplex, huh? (indicating) Look at this, you got stairs in an apartment. All my life, I dreamed about having steps in an apartment. Even one step. Sunken living room. Although, one step is really not all that sunken. (tries hard to elicit a laugh)
We should have left earlier. I told you.
I told her we'd all go out afterwards, okay? And don't applaud when she stops playing the first time. It's not over yet.
Uh-Huh (gulp) Why didn't she like me?
Ahhhh, Ahh, Ah, Ahhh, Ahh, Ah!
You don't know what that spot means to him. Once he gets it, he doesn't go out for weeks.
Si, por favor.
Elaine, this pilot...it doesn't matter to me, it's not me I'm concerned about...it's my mother. I've been over to the hospital to see her...
Really.
(Takes a sip) Hey, it's not too bad..
(disbelief) What? (laugh) Wh... what're you talking about? I'm not the one with the problem. (defensive) Lloyd Braun was in the nuthouse, not me.
You're luscious. You're ravishing. I would give up red meat just to get a glimpse of you in a bra. Im terribly sorry. (both George and the attractive female applicant stand up as George reaches across the desk and shakes her hand for coming in)
Oh, you're in here.
Why don't you think before you do something?
Look who's here!
(eating a pickle) Well they're his tickets, he can do what he wants with them.
Yeah, it's her uncle's.
Then afterwards maybe we could all go out together. Y'know she'll see me with my friends, she'll observe me as I really am, as myself. Maybe I can get some hand that way.
O.K., Danny, take a swing. (Tartabull swings the bat.) N-No! No! No! You're opening up your shoulder.
Eh, don't mention it.
(dismissive) It's no good.
She says she has to come to New York on business...
You're Killing Independent George! You know that, don't you?
I can't believe I didn't push for this sooner.
Ive had a lot of other paranormal stuff happen to me.
Good night, Stan.
(Getting up) You know what? Maybe I should take off.
Clock over there. (to chauffer) O'Brien.
Did you see the homeless guy on the library steps screaming obsenities and doing some calesthetics routine
No. Nothing. Fine. (he sits at the table)
Well, I'm also an architect. Is that pastrami?
Look, you don't understand. There was shrinkage.
Ill tell her I bumped into you, Im giving you a ride uptown.
That's it. This is it. I'm done. Through. It's over. I'm gone. Finished. Over. I will never work for you again. Look at you. (laughing) You think you're an important man? Is that what you think? You are a laughingstock. You are a joke. These people are laughing at you. You're nothing! You have no brains, no ability, nothing! (knocking object over on desk) I quit!
Hey.
That's exactly what I told Jerry!
I don't see any way around it.
(ready to leave) Well, thank you.
I have noticed she does tend to go to the bathroom right after we finish eating.
Wow! I didn't try that 'til I was 23.
Well, you know. (grins, snorts) It's understandable.
I can produce Keith Hernandez right here within the hour.
Alright, then. We've gotten to the bottom of that.
It was Moops.
Oh, this is unbelievable. I'm stuck. Every time I think I'm out, they pull me back in.
Listen, you go over to the ticket counter, I'm going to go stop in the gift shop and pick up a copy of Time magazine. There's supposed to ba blurb about Jerry in it and I think he mentioned my name!
Theyre the ones who should be ashamed. They signed me to a one-year contract. As long as I show up for work every day, they have to pay me.
Hey.
Do we have to...?
She cant kill me right?
One, two ... three, four.
Oh... make it stop.
This townhouse?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. But then, I said to him, 'Oh yeah? Well, the jerk store called, and they're running outta you.'
It's right in the explosion scene. So if you could just...leave me a little window. You know, my, uh, my aunt had a thing removed with a laser. All right, I don't want to interrupt your meal, so...
But I digress. Let me see, now. You were standing at one end of the line and I was right next to you. And I remember we were even for like, the first five yards and then , BOOM,...You were gone.
He started it.
No Doctor--
(stands up) I am.
I'm not paying $500 for this! It's a piece of junk!
I'm really going to do something with these three months.
(worked up) I can't have a cup of coffee with a person?! I'm not allowed to have coffee?!
Really? Why?
...but is there any way that I could possibly have Neil's phone number?
He's right! It's the same thing with the femenists. You know, they want everything to be equal, everything! But when the check comes, where are they?
That won't be necessary.
Hey. There is a couple of people that wouldn't mind having me out of the way.
(really animated) Alright, alright. You see? This is why I hate writing with a large group. Everybody has their own little opinions, and it all gets homogenised, and you lose the whole edge of it. I'm going with jerk store! Jerk store is the line! Jerk store! Yess!
All right. There's nothing to be worried about. She's just a little annoyed right now. Tomorrow I'll personally go over there. I'll apologize. I'll get the papers. Don't worry. Don't worry. (exits)
Well, I'm satisfied. Uh...my back is...killing me.
All right. I am happy, and I'll tell ya why -- because the two of you were making me and every one of your friends sick! Right, Elaine?
All right. Let's go over it again, one more time.
Take it right off the chest...
" 'course not"
With the orange hair, and the big clown shirt with the ruffles...
Hey.
