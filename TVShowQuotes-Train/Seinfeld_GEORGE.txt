Flying him in? How longs he staying for?
All right, look--wait--wait--Krama--wait, wait a minute, you are not. You are not goin' in. Ah-ahhh!
You think your parents would have any objections to taking a little kid to Paris with them? (Jerry looks at him confused) It turns out that the kid's father lives in Paris. (chuckling) Is that a coincidence? (Jerry smilies) Eh you know Alec wants me to take him over there so I figure as long as they're going (claps)
Maybe Manya missed the funeral because she was off visiting another galaxy that day.
horning on my rock climbing trip. It's just supposed to be me and Tony
Oh, nothin' much. I went over to jerry's, uh, talked to Jerry.
I take an eye test; I flunk it, the next thing you know I am swinging to the sweet sounds of risk management.
I think he was trying to tell me something, like it had some sort of a meaning.
Jerry, let's face it, I've always been handicapped. I'm just now getting the recognition for it. Name one thing I have that puts me in a position of advantage. Huh? There was a guy that worked at the Yankees-- no arms! He got more work done than I did, made more money, had a wife, a family, drove a better car than I did.
Yes, she's pretty. What difference does it make?
That's the sign! The test; if a - if a man makes it move.
What I don't get is, just because the battery is dead, you think she'd be able to roll up the hill with her hands!
You know, I used to love Paris. My uh, dead Fiance, Susan.. (opening wallet) In fact I. think I, I may have a picture of her..
You know, about how when you break it down, it's really a very positive thing. you know, you have a nure, with a ma in front of it. MA-NURE. Iz not bad.
I can't believe what's happening here. She hasn't taken her hands off me all night. She was always friendly around the office, but that was it.
It's OK. It's fine. She'll do it. I'm sure she'll still do it.
Why don't you think before you do something?
Hey check this out. I go to pick up my pictures and she says " I hope you got that mustard stain out of your shirt."
You've got 'shiksappeal'. Jewish men love the idea of meeting a woman that's not like their mother.
Ya gotta put on a show, ya always gotta give them a big show. You always have to be 'on' otherwise why would they like me? They'd just go for a better looking guy with more money.
Yeah, fun. IQ tests are totally bogus. They prove nothing.
Well at least you accomplished something. You got fish.
( mouth full) Hi, this is fantastic ( puts the pit in the a plate)D'you ever had a Macanaw peach?
I wanna get it back when we were the Gatsbys.
I could never do that. You know the ironic thing is if she had a smaller nose, I never could have gone out with her in the first place. She'd be out of my league with a smaller nose. And I really like her, I know that. And I know one other thing. I'm not getting past that nose.
Yeah, yeah, the flower guy. Listen, I know this all sounds a little crazy, but...
I'm not giving you the satisfaction. I'm gonna watch it again...
No-no-no, Kramer. Kramer! Kramer! You *cannot* abandon people in the middle of an airport pickup! It's a binding social contract. We... we must go forward... not back.
Boy - I'm really surprised at Elaine - that whole phone business - she should know better than that.
(to the cab driver) Excuse me, do you see anything on my lip here?
They got a new intern from Francis Louis High. His name is Keith. He comes in Mondays after school.
How are we gonna get out of here? We need a plan!
I got another meeting with Reilly. A whole new audience, and I bet I can get him to try that line again.
(To the man behind him in line) Yeah, right Im gonna get my car repaired at a dealership. Huh! Why dont I just flush my money down the toilet?
How hard could it be? You make a little contribution, you have a ceremony. I am going to think about this. I am really going to think about this.
I know I was just telling them the story.
Pretentious? Who, who isn't pretentious? Ha, ha, if everyone who was pretentious was in a mental institution, ... uh, obviously THIS isn't a mental institution.
He's getting on a bus, damn! (To the blind man) Those are nice glasses.
Miss Rhode Island? When are you seeing her?
So, whaddya say? You know you'll always be the only man I'll ever love.
Now, this is the basic layout for Mario's Pizza.
I can't be blind, Jerry The blind are courageous.
I don't know, she lives right around the corner. You could take it here or go to the coffee shop.
Oh, no, no, not at all. No, I have always felt that the most important thing in the world is spending time with family.
I really think I should have been consulted about this.
(Eating a sandwich) Oh, like you really know busboys.
I'll tell ya, if I had one of these things, I'd be eatin' hot dogs all the time.
I guess you two are the lucky ones.
Well, you never know. (picks up more shrimp) Let's see how many I can fit in my mouth.
Yeah, right. I'll just go up and say, "Hi, how ya' doing? Would you like a glass of white wine?" JERRY Before you got within twenty feet of this woman, she'd have her finger on the mace button. She's like an expensive car with one of those motion-sensor force field alarms. Any sudden movement in the area could set her off.
Hey, speaking of which, I found a great way to separate the skin from the top of the pudding without leaving any around the edges; Exacto knife.
It's fine, we'll just meet him at the bubble boy's house.
This is dating , you can't leave anything to chance.
Nothing It's not you. It's me. I have a fear of commitment. I don't know how to love.
Well, they gave birth to me, and, yada yada...
I just remembered, th-th-there's this Chinese restaurant out near Yankee Stadium, that puts flyers on all the cars.
Yesterday, took the day off. (Picks up a red Power Ranger action figure from the model and pretends it's him.) Now, from the time I left the room...
(To Carl) Oh, by the way, order anything you want, it's all on me. Just do me a tiny favor pretend we're old friends. Oh my God! Mr. Morgan! What a coincidence, it's Mr. Morgan. Mr. Morgan, I want you to meet a dear old friend of mine, Carl.
So--ah, Kramer. Why'd you ask me out to dinner? (amused) An' why Pomodoro?
Uh, I just went out, I went to look for my friend?
Ha! Ha! Hey! (moving his arms like it's so great to be all here)
The table, the stereo, the VCR, the velvet couch, where's the velvet?
Oh, well I didn't know you went into Queens Jerry.
Yeah, yeah, right here. (hands it to him)
Well, I'm gonna go back there later and return it when there's different people working.. You want to catch a movie?
Isn't that why we have locks on the doors?
Elaine, I'm, I'm shocked. I'm shocked. Here I go out in the spirit of the season (Elaine looking like she's not buying a word of it) and spend all my savings to buy you the most beautiful Christmas sweater I have ever seen to show my appreciation to you at Christmas and this is the thanks that I get at Christmas.
Ladies. I, uh, I haven't seen this before.
Should I give you my keys, is that the transaction, trading keys...? Because Elaine has my keys.
Kramer goes to a fantasy camp. His whole life is a fantasy camp. People should plunk down two-thousand dollars to live like him for a week. Do nothing, fall ass-backwards into money, mooch food off your neighbors and have sex without dating; that's a fantasy camp.
Susan! Jerry! Where are you? I know you're there! Answer me!
(trying to laugh it off) No, I was just wondering. The information could be relevant.
Well, Tony.. took a bit of a tumble
Really? I thought you and Celia were sleeping together?
I am. Im a nice guy. And she seduced me! We were in my apartment, Im sitting on the couch, shes on the chair. I get up to go to the bathroom, I come back, shes on the couch. What am I supposed to do? Not do anything? I couldnt do that. I wouldve insulted her.
All right, uh, okay, I got it, um, Ill sing.
The next thing you know, he'll have you driving him to the airport..
Oh I got it. (TO JERRY) That I'm supposed to remember. Where the car is, that's insignificant.
(with a mouth full of food) This is good. Oh, this is good.
How so? I'll tell you how so. She's bald!
No! I am not going to see a psychiatrist!
(in his mind) I think that ginger ale at the coffee shop is just Coke and Sprite mixed together. How can I prove it? Ah! Can't, dammit. (knock at door. George goes to open it)
If we could just harness this power and use it for our own personal gain, there'd be no stopping us.
I'm not gonna give you my card unless you tell me what it's for!
(defensive) So what? So what if I do?
Yeah I guess. What can I do? I gotta take her with me. Todd introduced us, I'm obligated.
Well it's not fair, Jerry. It's just not fair. All right, all right. That's it. I'm getting out of this thing.
No, I don't know who was doing that.
Well does it say anywhere in the contract about my car being used as a whorehouse? 'Cause I don't remember reading that clause either..
That should be 14, let me just...(corrects it with a pen.)
Well she was sending out our wedding invitations.
Isn't polite to say Hello when somebody says hello?
You can't leave! This is an ambulance! This is an emergency!
Shes a pig. The woman's a pig, what wrong with her--
Thank you very much. (Peggy leaves the menus and walks away) So guess what I got do tomorrow?
Alright, so that's one tuck and one no-tuck.
Oh well, that's, uh, thats just because we're, uh, standing on opposite sides.
(Runs over to him, not wanting him to leave) What? You're going?
You know she was behind the idea. She was going to champion the show. That's what I was bring her up there to tell you. And she liked me.
And maybe we could go out and do something.
It's like Im thinking of something, and you're (snaps fingers) one step ahead of me.
(to the guy next to him) This guy stinks. (speaking of Michael)
Oh yes, by no means, the mood. Let me know if there's anything I can do to lend support to the mood.
Do you have something a little more... less expensive?
Oh that's OK, really, don't worry about it.
And this is the first you're seeing of the coat?
Alright, let's see, let's see. What else. What else. Oh yeah, what does she do?
Wait, wait a second, what are you doing?
Aw c'mon. It's a fantastic name. It's a real original, nobody else is gonna have it and I absolutely love it.
A little notice would've helped! How many people?
No. And he's not a pig-man is he?
I know what you were trying to do. Nobody does it better than me.
You don't need the cufflinks! You have the same name! (no reaction) 'Jerry'! (heads for door, grabbing his coat)
(To himself) So you're havin' the sex, next day you don't have to call. That's pretty good. (Back to Jerry) Go ahead.
Alright, very good, very good...go fold your little balloon animals, Eric. Eric! (chuckles) What kind of name is that for a clown, huh?
I just talked to Mr. Kruger, he'll be down in a minute. He wanted me to take a photograph for the record.
Hey, where you just at the health club?
Well we were all eating the raisins. And I remember you--you were eating some of the raisins. And then you left, and the raisins were gone. And I was just wondering if, you know (chuckles), maybe you took them with you.
So, you know, she calls and says she wants to go out with you tomorrow night? God bless! Devil you!
Well nothing. I didn't actually say that. (Karen is still laughing)
Right. He cooks my food, he cleans my house, he does all my shopping for me. And there you go, that's your program.
No you wouldn't. Nobody would. It's just that... they were missing, and... well I'm just inquiring. (chuckles nervously)
I tell you something. I wish there were pig-men. You get a few of these pig-men walking around suddenly I'm looking a whole lot better. Then if somebody wants to fix me up at least they could say, "Hey he's no pig-man!"
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. All right. I don't think we're gonna have any problem with that. (chuckles nervously) Good talking to you Tom. Really.
I don't even know what they think. That's why I'm in therapy.
Okay, how about this? All right, we get married March 21st, the first day of Spring.
I have to say, as a glasses wearer I take exception to that. That's like me buying a wheelchair to cruise around in.
What are you doing here, I though you were going to the airport.
Did you see that? The guy's walking away. What is wrong with you? That was a three hundred dollar profit.
"Arrrrrrgh!! .. It's George.. Oh! Sports wholesaler. yeah. yeah. .. thanks for calling back. No , no , no still got the shoes, still got the shoes. Lots of them. This is.. beautiful athletic gear."
Can you believe it? It's happening! It's finally happening! I'm free!!
I...was trying to lead the way. We needed a leader! Someone to lead the way to safety.
(Still with a tone) He is. You dont know what Im doin here.
You know, Lloyd, I-I've been to the doctor (hands George the card) there's really nothing they can do.
Then I see my clothes floating out there. The tied took them out, not the kids.
Alright, listen, I'll give you your spare keys, but I don't have them with me. Can I please have mine to give to back to Kramer?
Yeah. (another pause) Not that I care, one way or the other, but these doctors today really do amazing things, you know, if you were so inclined. And again, I'm not suggesting.
So, that's it. All of my darkest fears, and... everything I'm capable of. That's me.
Man, would I like to see the look on his face.
It's not my fault! I wasn't going to do anything until you got her all juiced up with your story about having the affair with the matador!
bowling! what do you say bowling? bowling's insane! bowling is crazy time
(Holding camera) Look at this, I only have one picture left... How 'bout a shot of me and Mr. Morgan?
(Shrugging it off) She'll be fine. I gotta go to the hospital to see her tonight.
"Argh!!..Anyway...Jimmy couldn't be here today so he asked me to fill in for him, and I'm sure that you'll be impressed at what can be accomplished after only a few short days of training.....yeah!"
(quiet, desperate) Maybe she can get me another picture of man-hands. (calling) Elaine!
What's to think about? If Putty says it's what it is, it's what it is. He's not gonna cheat you.
You only think that because you know me.
You must be very proud Mr. Visaki. (shaking his hand) And may I say sir they're lovely girls, absolutely lovely girls. It's nice to see such fine upstanding women in gainful employment, Mr. Visaki.
Yes, In fact, her mother is in the hospital right now. It's some kind of a Diverticulitis. (he continues walking slowly towards Steinbrenners desk)
Hey, hey. Kramer, what are you doing? You can't smoke in here.
You know, I think I could have played with dolls if their were dolls in the house. It seems like fun to me. It doesn't seem like a gender thing. I think I would like to play with dolls. What's so terrible?
Wait a minute, Rinitze? Don't they have somme really cool suits in there?
Are you crazy?! What are you doing?! You'll get us killed!
Im starving! I can feel my stomach sucking up against my spine.
(Smiling) You got it, Ma. (She smiles back, nodding) A little later. (George sits back in a nearby chair, looking at the divider in anticipation)
he's the first cool guy I've ever been friends with in my whole life. You know.. it's a different world when you're with a cool guy, he's not afraid of anybody. You should hear the way he talks to waitresses.. he gets free pie!
Well I just stomped some pigeons in the park. They - they didn't move.
(To his girlfriend) Nina, you have to decide right now. Jerry or me?
I know. This was like a record. My previous record was when Joni Hirsch asked me not to tell anybody that we slept together. Kept a lid on that for about 28 seconds.
(Slowly backing away, he's not at all committed to the conversation) Yeah.. television.
Well you know there is an unusual number of people in this country having sex with AMPUTEES! (grabs the forum from Kramer and walks over to the clerk) . . . Penthouse forum, newspaper, gum, Clark Bar.
And you really believe this guy doesn't want to have kids.
Why even try anymore? There's no sense to it. I'm never gonna meet anybody, I should just accept it.
Oh, what? What? That? Are you kidding? I didn't quit. What? You took that seriously?
Ladies and gentlemen, this (Opens the door, Steven is standing there) is Steven Koren. His G.P.A. is a solid 2.0! Right in that meaty part of the curve - not showing off, not falling behind.
I can't believe she got involved with a shrink.
No, no. I just got here. A few minutes ago.
Alright, I just have to go over to the Ross' apartment and drop off Susan's sunglasses. You'll come with me?
I been, uh, thinking about the family. Tell me, uh, about Aunt Baby.
So you don't think she really has a boyfriend?
(dismayed) I didn't even know you wanted to get serious!
Yes, good to see you, too. And Good luck with, uh... with the whole thing, there.
Of course I'm back. Why wouldn't I be back? My mother's in the hospital, I'm going to pay her a visit.
All right! All right. I'll tell you what. How about this? Got the date; March 21st, the first day of spring.
(grateful, relieved) Thank you! I'm gonna make you both so happy!
I know. I can tell. It's one of my powers. Why, did you ever fake?
Well just take an overview. Can't you just take an overview?
Jerry took the flyers off the car, I got the whole thing covered.
Hey, I am not a prude sweetheart. I swing with the best of them. (snapping his fingers 5 times)
I cant believe- (falls on his knees) WE ALREADY DISCUSSED THIS!
Why? Why isn't it possible? I mean, they're both bite marks.
Nothing really, you know...just eh, stroll around the cell blocks, maybe eh, take in a shower fight. (chuckles.) Hey eh, you know you got a bounced check hanging up in the little market over on Columbus?
Wa, I'm not getting out of this cab
I'll tell you something, if I'd own a company, my employees would love me. They'd have huge pictures of me up on the walls and in their home, like Lenin.
(hearing Elaine over the phone) What, she's out?
Huh, nggh [snort] Stop. (flirting with her he playfully hits her arm with the menu, then flicks it into the air)
(to salesman) Well, maybe you could show me something else.
No, no, no, this suit is not for sale. (tries to take off the suit from the guy)
Yeah, it's being framed right now. I don't even know what it costs. (beat) Not, uh, too expensive, is it?
Are you kidding? I lie every second of the day. My whole life is a sham!
You know, I'm down to one kiss hello. My aunt Sylvia.
Anyway, we met with NBC about a month ago and they gave us the green light to go ahead and write a pilot. In fact, we got a big meeting with them tomorrow. They gotta approve of the story before we can write.
I can do hard time for this one. And community service!
(takes a bite) Oh, that's good. That's very good.
Sorry? Why sorry? What you got to be sorry about?
Come on, lets not stand here too long, we might run in to her.
The cashier is at lunch - which is where Id like to be.
Y'know, I'm better with the mothers than I am with the daughters.
Alright, stop it Kramer, you're freakin' me out. (The waitress comes over.)
Yes, I am familiar with this syndrome -- she's a two-face.
I mean, I could understand if there was something else playing, but it's this or nothing.
That's right! He never apologized to me for saying that I would stretch out the neck hole of his sweater.
That's... what we used to call him in high school, the exterminator. He's a linebacker. Oh, did we have some wild times.
That's what I'm afraid of. You know Mr. Steinbrenner, . . .
Well I, uh, I'm not sure how you pronounce it or anything, but I, uh, I believe it's Mnage  Trois?
I tried! I almost threw it down the incinerator, but I couldn't do it. The guilt was too overwhelming. (Grabs the doll, opening the door to leave) Susan's so attached to this thing.
Maybe it's got something to do with that 42 in the corner .
(frustrated) Fine. Fine. (to customer) Excuse me. (heading for the door) Think I'm gonna forget about this? I haven't forgotten about this. I don't forget that easily!
Huh-ho! Oh! You are too much, Mr. Kruger! Too much!
Alright, alright, I'll call Heather, you'll get your hat back, I will get a second date. Ha ha ha. Now watch the magic.
Okay. Hey, you know what, maybe I should give it to my therapist to read. She's smart, I trust her.
I doubt it. You know what he's doing now? He's putting a pool table in my old bedroom.
You ask me here to have lunch, tell me you slept with Elaine, and then say you're not in the mood for details. Now you listen to me. I want details and I want them right now. I don't have a job, I have no place to go. You're not in the mood? Well you get in the mood!
Because, I've got the coat. I can sit in the car and not get cold.
Yeah, drove away.. You know, I said 'Hello' to him. You know, he's - he's-
Unless she goes for the bathroom. Thats my only chance. (George crumbles. He drops the cassette on the table.) Who am I kidding? I cant do this, I cant do this. I dont even know how to work those stupid machines.
She wants me to take an IQ test.
Makes the 11 gauge look like a cap pistol.
I don't know what you're getting all riled up about. There are probably a million Costanzas-
Well, maybe so...but it was good enough for Mr. Jon Voight.
Of course, the uh, the four passes. (closes partition) Four passes to Madison Square Garden? Wait a minute. Wait a minute! Of course! Chicago! The Knicks are playing the Bulls tonight!
I can't believe I didn't push for this sooner.
He got about uh, two inches from... there.
(Gets up, stopping him) Woah, woah, woah! What are you telling me for? You really had me going, there! C'mon, sit down. (They both sit back down) What do you want to do when you grow up?
Ah, would you take this picture away from me. Take it away and get it outta here. Let me just sign this and go.
(coyly, he looks down and runs his finger along the top of the chair back in front of him) Do you, uh ... do you know what Im ... thinking about now?
I gotta go back to the library and talk to him. I gotta find out if I&Mac226;m the guy who ruined his life.
(pointedly) She could do a lot worse than Mr Peanut, my friend.
(to Jerry) It's all white Jerry! It's all white!
I had a great time tonight Carrie. And I am going to call you as soon as I get home.
What could I do?! We fooled around and went to a movie!
Ava was one of the reasons I used to like going to work, she was a friend. Now we sleep together and suddenly, I don't know how to talk to her. Every time I go to the bathroom I pass her desk. I have to plan little patter. I spend half my day writing. Then afterwards, I sit in my office and analyze how it went. If it was a good conversation, I don't go to the bathroom for the rest of the day. I see her laughing and talking with other people, they're all so loose and relaxed, I think, 'that used to be me. I want to go back there again.'
Whatever. Listen, I'm very concerned about this guy.
Yeah, I thought I might give her a call. I, I don't meet that many women. I meet like three women a year. I mean, we've been introduced. She knows my name.
You're not letting him win. He wins till you're forty.
(To Jerry) We got work to do. What about the meeting?
I don't think so, Vic. I've done my homework. '89 Volvo, that's the car for me, it's the one I want.
The prop comic? (Ronnie holds up his water gun and smiles.) Oh, hi...I didn't recognize you, what...did you get a haircut?
Hey, you gotta take a ride with me later. I borrowed my father's car. '68 GTO.
Well, Jerry. There was a pretty good chance I was never gonna have sex again anyway.
The truth. you want the truth? It is your earrings It is the chopsticks but it's so much more. You're pretentious. You call everyone by their full name You call my doorman, Sammy, "Samuel" but you didn't even say "Samuel" You went "Sam - U- EL" Papie-eh Mach-eh What is Papie-ay Mach-ay?
Well, at least we know the prosthetic squirrel hips work ... sorry bout the set.
What if she becomes Miss America? You could be dating Miss America, Jerry!
(to the waitress bringing his doughnut) And a slice of devil's food cake.
"Hey you know , I felt we had like a synergy out there,you know, like we were really helping each other."
All right, All right, all, right!!( gives the headphones to Kramer) How you gonna find out who this is?
I dont know where the nurse is. Sweetheart why dont you get a nurse for mommy?  Anyway I was just curious. Remember the other day you were saying something about my trip.
Well, if it doesn't concern me, then I can stay. (Kramer grabs the back of George's chair, drags him out into the hallway and closes the door.)
Listen Jerry. With all due respect, Bania's voice is the voice of a new generation. My generation.
(Standing up, still waking up) Alright, you know what we should do? We should go to the movies. Get away from this script for a while..
What? I'm not married. I'm not allowed to go out with somebody else?
I would like to dip my bald head in oil and rub it all over your body. [No reaction] You don't understand! It's a miracle! You don't understand because you don't speak English!
This woman just set me up for a job!
How come youre not doin the second show tomorrow?
Exactly! Because neither one of us can't handle a woman all by ourselves.
Just the last few innings of a double-header.
Attention Steinbrenner and front-office morons! Your triumphs mean nothing. You all stink. You can sit on it, and rotate! This is George Costanza. I fear no reprisal. Extension five-one-seven-oh.
I suppose if I had suggested Liam Neeson Day, you'd all be patting me on the back.
You know what this means? I can't see her anymore either.
Boy that-that bank clock is-is eight minutes off.
An apartment-warming gift? We got to give presents to people for moving? Birthdays, Christmas, it's enough gifts. I would like one month off.
(yells) Wow! Who put this cup right on the new table!
Make myself comfortable. What does that mean? Does she want me to take my clothes off? Is she taking her clothes off? What if I take my clothes off and she still has hers' on? Then I really look like an idiot. She could get offended and leave. So maybe I should leave them on, but what then if she takes her off? Then she'll feel humiliated. 'Make yourself comfortable'. I got this unbelievable woman and this 'comfortable'-thing can ruin me. I got it! I take my shoes off and sit on the bed. There, that's comfortable. She can't accuse me being unconvertible.
Yes, it is exciting! All right, this is gonna be my new face.
What happens if the husband dies after the wife, who brings in the clothing in then?
Elaine, shes a psychic. She knows how the kids going to be.
Well, I didn't mean to hurt you kid.
No, no, he mimed it. That's what was so funny about it.
Excuse me Ms. which street are we on?
(grabs the phone quick) Got it, Got it,...Hello?
(chuckles) Really? Well, we'll just see about that. Ta-ta, Tut-tle.
Well, you didn't hear it from me, but needless to say, if you go in there - stick with the consumee.
I'm sure we're all aware of the flaws and biases of standardized tests..
(afraid not) No no, no no no. You're not goin' in there.
Yep, and the photo was all fixed and back on his desk, no thanks to you.
Um, excuse me, have you see a guy with like a horse face, big teeth, and a, and a pointed nose?
This week. My father got a deal from a friend of his. It's Gore-Tex. You know about Gore-Tex?
Hey, Cosmo what happened to your mother last night. She hung me out to dry.
Do me a favor would you? Would you change lanes? Would you get outta this lane. You gotta get out of this lane. This lane stinks. They're all double parked here Please get outta this lane. I'm beggin you please please.
Well, a lot of people keep popcorn in the house.
I'm out! Fantastic apartment right across from mine, huh. I can't wait for you to see it.
How do you know it was her dude?
(sidling in) Is this a bad time? I hope I'm not disturbing anything.
Sure, sure, sure, sure. (patting Jerry on the shoulders) How about these seats? Are these fantastic, huh? Huh? I feel like Lincoln.
All right, that's enough. I gotta go home and take a nap.
Kramer, what the hell are you talking about?
Listen. You're beautiful. You're intelligent. You'll meet other girls...
Of course you do, but youre imagining a guy you like, not a guy who goes, Oh no, I dont drink coffee late at night. If I call her now, shes gonna think Im too needy. Women dont wanna see need. They want a take-charge guy  a colonel, a Kaiser, a tsar.
It's not contest. The guy had nothing! The ship went down, he got into a life boat, I mean, come on.
They're reorganizing the staff, and I'm on thin ice with this guy as it is.
I tell ya, I am hooked on these books on tape.
Hey. How come I didn't get a Christmas card? Everybody else got one. Jerry got one, Kramer got one. I thought we were good friends. I don't get a Christmas card. I don't get it.
Sid, who's gonna move the cars while you're away?
I don't have a spare set. All my keys say 'do not duplicate'.
Oh I would love that. You think he'd really do it?
Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute, don't tell me, don't tell me. It starts with a . . . Duncan Meyers. Oh, wow, this is something. I haven't seen you guys in what, twenty years?
Shhh! Listen, you gotta do me a favor. Give me your wallet. I'll give it back to you later.
All right, I?ll tell you what, you seem like a nice guy, let?s stop jerking around. Give me.. two hundred and fifty dollars, I?ve got people waiting for me, I've got to get the hell out of here.
It's like you're livin' in the Playboy Mansion! Did she, uh, did she frolic?
You know what word Susan used last night? Hnuh. Vault! hu,
Jerry Seinfeld. My best friend. He can explain all of this. (calls to Jerry) Jerry.
I'll tell you what's insane the price that I could get you on a new desktop computer.
(Loud, so everyone at the wedding can hear) You slept with the groom?!
Oh, no, that's just the old, uh, the old handicap acting up.
I dunno. I guess I have to wait for her to die.
Ah. You see, the man who was the butler, uh, had gotten into a car accident with Jerry, and because he didn't have any insurance, the judge decreed that the man become Jerry's butler.
Elaine, I once told a woman that I coined the phrase, "Pardon my French."
I can't believe they actually found your stolen car.
He purposely mispronounced my name. Instead of saying, "Costanza" He'd say, "Can't stand ja". "Can't stand ja" ... He made me smell my own gym socks once.
She asked about me? What did- What did she say?
There putting in a lost and found because of me. There's a time limit but still.
No, you're not a divorcee. Youre just separated. You're---you're a separatee.
I have an aunt that died at seven.
well I don't know if there's gonna be any place to eat up there
Yes! Yes, I'm the one! Hey! So, you know Jon Voight!
Elaine, I got to have another picture of Gillian.
All right. I'm gonna try givin' them fifty-five dollars each... (to Elaine) What do you think?
Don't you see. She's looking at my pictures.
You've got to start seeing someone else. Get out of this relationship.
It's in Detroit though, it's an expensive flight.
I just thought of a great name for myself, if I ever become a porno actor.
Ah, great, great. (sniffs) What's that smell? Smoke? (walks to the kitchen) Hey everybody, I think I smell some smoke back here...(smoke boils into the doorway.) FIRE! FIRE! Get out of the way!
How are we gonna get out of here? They'll kill us!
You know, that, that thing about her being too good for him. I mean, I was just bein' folksy. They could tell I was just being folksy..?
Stay back! (Runs out of the room, pushing Jerry out ahead of him)
Well, not really. After all, she did get together with George Peppard. I mean, Fred.
Well then she's just a Liar, Isn't she?
What do I do? Well actually, I'm a writer. In fact, I'm writing a comedy pilot for NBC right now.
Oh, this is my friend, Jerry Seinfeld. I just bumped into him around the corner. Isnt that a coincidence? The funny thing is, I see him all the time.
(Still on the showers) Can I use hot water on my face?
Look at this. There's no spaces here. (to another car) Excuse me, are you gettin' out?
You think she could be an 'it'? Could she be an 'it'?
All right, stop it! Stay away from my breasts! Chest!
What come on? Have you ever dated a woman that worked in your office?
(Definite) I'll take it in my room. (Walks off)
Any more grape juice? (Gets up and goes to the kitchen. Remy moves to the end of the couch where George was sitting.)
Hum..( to Elaine) Hey! did you talk to Paula?
(trying again with Glenda) I'm gonna count to three. If you don't give up the chair, the wig is coming off.
Look at where we are! (referring to the seat usher) He's not stopping! He just keeps going and going and going! (the usher abruptly stops at the second row) We're not in the first row?
All right there you go. It's a '47 cabin all right. So, we'll see you tomorrow.
It's not working, Jerry. It's just not working. (sits down next to Elaine)
Jerry, this whole Ellen situation.. has gone far enough.
Well, I didn't really think about what I was gonna do with all..
(depressed) Feel like I can't do anything wrong.
(Takes a few seconds to mull this one over. Shooting Jerry a confused look, he repeats it) "The panties your mother laid out for you"? (Jerry nods) What does that mean?
No, don't say a word. If she thinks my friends are jerks, then I'm a *jerk*...
Oh I'm seeing someone, yes. You know her, Daphne Bower.
Oh, yeah, right. I wish I had something on my mind. (pregnant pause) So how about that Kramer, huh?
C-Communist? I am a Yankee, sir, first and foremost.
There must be some way to find out.
My censor quit two years ago. He checked into a clinic. Emotionally exhausted.
Those are my friends I was telling you about. We're gonna talk to them, pull over.
I was trying to stick the landing. (indistinct) ...was right around here.
How many people does he do that for?
(???), we'll see you in a little while.
They're selling coffee, bran muffins.. you're surrounded by reading material. It's entrapment!
Yeah. I did some shopping. Some new clothes shopping. (turns to a man) Can I borrow your menu?
Really? (Jerry shakes his head) Maybe this will become like a cool thing, living with your parents.
Would you stop it. (Susan playfully bites his ear lobe again) Would you quit it please. Someone is going to see us here.
Hey Deena, come on, give us a hug. (they hug) Oh my gosh, you look as pretty as you did back in high school.
Because if I watch it at my apartment I feel like I'm not doing anything. If I watch it here, I'm out of the house; I'm doing something.
She can't take it. It's not hers, it's theirs. Once there's no theirs there's no hers, it should be ours.
So, I am have to going to break up with you.
No problem. There's no problem. She just owes me ten dollars, that's all.
(Sincerely) Thank you.. I, uh.. that might not work out.
I'd love to be a Civil War buff. ... What do you have to do to be a buff
(into phone, frantic) Mister Dalrimple! Mister Dalrimple I have to talk to you!
He wouldn't put it on if he didn't like it.
I cant stand doing laundry. Thats why I have forty pairs of underwear.
Im sorry, I dont see the big deal about being a matador. The bull charges, you move the cape, whats so hard?
I'm cold too. At least you've got a coat. Let's get in the car.
Hey, did I tell you I called one of those girls from the personal ads in The Daily Worker?
Well all right, beautiful, so you stop in. Ya, ya visit the bubble boy for twenty minutes and then we can go.
I had nothing to do wtih any of this! I met all her friends, I didnt want to meet them. I kept trying to avoid it. I knew it would only get me in deeper. But they were everywhere! They kept popping up all over the place. This is Nancy, this is Susan, this is Amy, this is my cousin, this is my brother, this is my father... Its like Im in quicksand.
Are you crazy? This is like discovering Plutonium ... by accident.
Well, it was very nice meeting you Shelly and Jerry be careful, there's a lot of nuts out there. (to Paula) All right you have everything?
You see if I stay the whole year, I get it all.
(animated) Fixed up? A cup of coffee! A cup of coffee is not a fix up!
What's he yelling about? They're stealing jackets here!
Would you stop that please. Would you just stop that?
No no no, you know actually we are friends of a serial killer.
(coming back to the table from the bathroom) Oh uh. You ready?
No, you haven't. Well, maybe you have. What do I know.
I'll tell you what I'd like to do. I'd like to replace that rye.
Well, what was I supposed to do? Get out of the shower, put on my bathrobe? Go all the way down to the other end? Come all the way back?
They got a billion people over there and he found a relative.
Yes, I know so. You happen to be a very eligible lesbian.
There are some people in this room who would have been very happy to never see this briefcase again. There are people in this room who think they can destroy other people's property and get away with it. Well, let me tell you something about those people. They weren't counting on this brain! And this tape recorder.
Mr. Pensky. I was just working on your file. I was transferring the contents of the file into this flexible accordion-style folder.
Yes, I will do the opposite. I used to sit here and do nothing, and regret it for the rest of the day, so now I will do the opposite, and I will do something!
Is this the ticket holders line, or the buyers?
Oh, sure. I mean, after all, you were almost my, uh... OK, I gotta go.
Yes. Yes. You know what's interesting. The quarterback for the Atlanta Falcons is Bobby Hebert. No "r" which I find fascinating. You know it's Herbert h-e-r-b-e-r-t, Hebert h-e-b-e-r-t. "Hebert" it's a fun name to pronounce. Try and say it Hebert. Take a shot. All right. (check arrives) All right. I
What about a rec room? Huh? Or a community center.
Its called Sendrax. Theyve got some new kind of technique for televising opera.
This woman drove us out of our minds
Yes, two solariums. Quite a find. And I have horses, too?
Well, I'm the good boy again. Can you believe that?
This thing can't hurt me, can it? I mean, it is a laser. What if it hits my eye?
You know I still don't know how you can call lunch with me a business expense.
So Anyway, I started to compliment Elaine on her sketches and it turns out,they're Paula's.
All right, relax, tough guy. I got to go out to my father's garage, help him sell some computers.
You ditched me. That's twice. Now I demand to know what's going on!
(not expecting the statue to be thrown) Dit.
(Munching on a hamburger) This Arbys is good.
No no. That's not what I was trying to do.
It's two completely different sounds. "ih" and "eh".
Im starving. You got any of those free donuts you use to soften people up?
No sports jacket? I don't need a sports jacket? Writers wear sports jackets.
It's like some pod landed from another planet and took your body. Don't fall asleep Elaine.
Yes, because the water was cold... and the chewing warms me up.
Im outta the picture. I am outta the picture. (laughs) Its only a matter of time now.
Fabulous, I'll think about that George, thank you!
(smiling) I'm on a winning ball club, Jerry. They probably wanna pick my brains.
I heard they found a family in your freezer
If anything happens here, can I count on you?
I don't know how a fish could eat laughs.
(Asking Elaine) Jerry seem a little weird when I mentioned Nina?
What, are you kidding? (Points at the flaws of Jerry's hands) The knuckles are all out of proportion. you got hair over there - where do you get off comparing your hands to my hands?! This is a one-in-a-million hand. (Points to his own hand)
I can produce Keith Hernandez right here within the hour.
Ill tell her I bumped into you, Im giving you a ride uptown.
So now, the father is screaming at me, he's demanding that I pay for the boom box. Finally, I gave them a fake address and got the hell out of there.
Jerry! Jerry! Je Jerry Jerry . The most unbelievable thing has just happened, it's too Unbelievable! I'm sitting in the coffee shop, i'm talking to Susan, were talking about shoe laces (does two guns to the head) so in walks..in walks David, right, he walks right to the table..righ I introduced him to Susan..and he says get this (laughs) he says 'boy you could do a lot better than this guy' huh right (more laughing by George, Jerry is totally just mellow and straight faced) The exact same thing that I said to him, just to get back at me just to get back at me..and then, and then she says she wants to be alone for awhile..Alone Jerry! I think that she thinks that she could do better (laughs) Do you appreciate this? Do you see the irony of this? Do you see what is going on here? What's the matter?
What do you need her for? There's a million lawyers.
You know, Jason, I, uh, I couldn't help notice, I... I didn't get my apology.
C'mon Jerry, let's go. What was that all about?
Well hello. Um, ah, specifically the reason that I'm here, uh, I don't know uh what Elaine told you but uh I broke up with my girlfriend a couple of weeks ago. Actually she broke up with me [struggling with his coat zipper] and uh, well, I was the cause of it and uh, I just wanted to find out from you ... What's with this thing?
What do you mean? The engagement is off, we get the TV back. That's business.
I had to listen to a five minute discussion on which one is actually called shmoopy.
Look at these salesmen. The only thing these guys fear is the walk-out. No matter what they say, you say, "Ill walk out of here right now!"
My place? NO, no, no. I hate my place. I don't wanna go back to my place.
Oh good, good, come in. Come in, welcome. I'm George. And this is Jerry, over there, on the phone, that's Jerry. And you are, um?
I know it's a doll, but it looks like my mother!
It's a little unusual. So, uh, Susan and I were thinking, uh, dinner at our house Saturday night. Just the four of us.
Where are you living? Are you here? Are you on this planet? It's impossible. It can't be done.
Dont you think you get more without it?
Yes, well you see, the deceased landed on my car. The uh splat, as it were, actually occurred on the roof of my car. Now of course I can't help but feel that had it been a convertible this whole tragedy might have been averted but I've never been the kind of guy to buy a convertible, what with the baldness and everything.
I think that's Mr. Hayman. ...The gym teacher from our High School.
Hey, at least I'm bringing something to this. (Starts flipping through envelopes, reads one ) "Have you seen me?" (Flicks it aside) Nope. (looks at next envelope) Woah, something from Whatley.
(Takes it and throws it out window) Get outta my way!
I gave. I gave everything I could Mrs. Sokol. but nothing was good enough for her.
Where are you gettin' a Wizard for fifty dollars?
Well, I wanna put a picture of me and my boss Mr. Morgan up at the office.
I dont know, I cant eat. You, you cant have anything anymore. Look at this, look at this. Eggs out. Coffee out. French fries out. BLT out! I go to visit my grandparents three big brisket sandwiches, Im sittin here with a carrot! Theyre closing in on a hundred, Im sayin to them, How can you eat that stuff? (They look at their menus again.) Im so sick about losin that choose, you dont know.
She cant even afford to go out to lunch. She's been eating in a high school cafeterias She pretends to be a teacher. It's pathetic.
??? KNOCK OFFS. I NOT GOING TO DO IT! AND YOU'RE GOING TO CALL STEINBRENNER BACK AND CANCEL THE WHOLE THING.
(through a mouthful of shrimp) Well, why don't we just put a monitor in his skybox?
Probably because this whole Universe is against me!
you know, just by conversing, you can really learn a lot about a person.
Wait a minute, she did a skin cancer screening at Peterman?
(frantic) Jerry! Jerry, muh--muh--my hair-dryer ruined the picture! An' I need another one or I can't get back into the forbidden city!
I was betrayed! That kid was like a son to me. And if there's one person you should be able to hold down, it's your own flesh and blood. Like my father.. my father's father before him.
I mean , when I said Hello did she say Hello back?
What is that, immigrants come over, you show them how to act natural?
All right, all right, I didnt want to tell you this. You wanna know why she called you?
Peggy! (they all sit) His daughter Peggy. Peggy's coming over to serve.
Mister Fowler, I-I have a squirrel here that is a miracle of modern science! (laughs)
The man in the cape--I bet you he is mixed up in this! I don't trust men in capes.
I don't know. (George sits down at the table. Kramer enters.)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, go. Go about your business, I'll just wander around.
Of course I'm all right. I'm here with my girl, Nina. And what better way to pass the time than gabbing with my best friend -- with whom there are no secrets. (Flashes two intertwined fingers) Like this. Since the fourth grade.
An apartment complex, the uh the Eiffel Towers. uumm Like I said uh you'll be getting a postcard uh in a few days and again I'm sorry.
You can do better than me. You could throw a dart out the window and hit someone better than me. I'm no good!
I kept looking at her face. Id go, Cmon, love her. Love her!
Okay, so you remember I made the initial call Sunday, she doesnt call back. I call again Monday, I leave another message. I call Tuesday, I get the machine again, I know youre there, I dont know what your story is. Yesterday, Im a volcano  I try one more call, the machine comes on, and I let fly like Mussolini from the balcony, Where the hell do you get the nerve? You invite me up for coffee and then you dont call me back for four days? I dont like coffee, I dont have to come up. Id like to get one more shot at the coffee just so I could spit it in your face.
Lupe. That's very nice, very nice. Listen, are you going to be making up the bed in the morning?
Maybe it's some small thing I could change. Like a moustache. Or wearing a top hat, or a monocle, or a..or a cane.
I have nothing to say to anybody. I'm so uninteresting. I think I'm out of conversation.
Um, excuse me, I - I think you forgot my bread.
I calculated my odds of ever getting together with a Portuguese waitress. Mathematically, I had to do it, Jerry.
I'm all for awkward pauses. Fix me up with her.. Wait a minute, Nina just saw me in my Timberlands! Now I have to wear them every time I see her.
You would not believe what just happened. I was waiting for you and this woman was sitting at the counter.
Hmm-hmm, not by a long shot. I'm calling up the Rosses and inviting them up to my non-existent place in the Hamptons. Then we'll see who blinks first.
For a mental patient. Wait a minute, the phone, we'll call the police.
This is not about them. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to exercise Jerry's gaskets.
How could that piece of *crap* cost $98.00!?
Thats exquisite. Listen, uh, if its not too much trouble, could you pass me that paper over there?
Oh my God, I forgot to tell you. I got a letter today from the State Controller's Office. Y'know when I was going to public school back in Brooklyn, every week I used to put fifty cents in the Lincoln Savings Bank.
You know what you should do? You should tell this guy you're seeing somebody else. That's the easiest way to get out of these things.
When I was ten years old, my parents had this very same statue on the mantle of our apartment. Exactly. And, one day, I grabbed it, and I was using it as a microphone. I was singing, MacArthur Park, and I got to the part about, Ill never have that recipe again, and it slipped out of my hand and it broke. My parents looked at me like I smashed the ten commandments. To this day, they bring it up. It was the single most damaging experience in my life, aside from seeing my father naked.
I dont know, what were doin here, this is ridiculous.
(Suggesting) Maybe she's a nudist. You know, those nudist colony people..
Would you get out of here. Who's gonna turn down a chair? I would be very interested to know how he felt about all of this. Maybe I'll have a talk with him.
Come on. Ya wanna go get some lunch?
Excuse me, the guy is wearing a jacket that my friend is...
How could you not know who Bozo the Clown is?
Don't you see what it says here? Don't you understand what that's implying?
Yup. It's really just a question of what kind. Thinking about a bar stool.
I'll tell ya, if I ever get out of here, I'm gonna change my life. I'm gonna do a whole Zen thing. Take up yoga, meditate.. I'll eat right. Calm down, lose my anger.. (Sees Jerry and Elaine aren't listening. He snaps) Hey, is anybody listening?!
I know, but antiques are very popular right now.
'When you're alone, and life is making you lonely, you can always go...'
All right. Well, we'll see what happens to you.
Its my money. What should I do? Throw it out the window? I know a guy who took his vacation on his change.
Well, then, I am gonna have to ask you to turn your key.
Do you feel funny? He didn't say anything.
Why did he tell you and not me?
He's beboppin' and scattin', and I'm losin' it!
This guy from my old neighborhood. Lloyd Braun. He's a big advisor to Mayor Dinkins. He thinks he's so cool.
My whole life has been a complete waste of time, (chuckle)
Well, I'm still here. You took out the other guy!
No, no, I don't think I'm special. My mother always said I'm not special.
I'll get him to see a real doctor. You just stay away from this.
you said "step off"? wow, that is too much hey..huh hey (George turns the cap his wearing backwards like Tony) Tony, I huh, I just had this brainstorm for us. Can you guess what it is?
So let me ask you a question about the tip jar. I had a little thing with the calzone guy this week. I go to drop a buck in the tip jar and just as I am about to drop it in he looks the other way. And then when I am leaving he gives me this look think thanks for nothing. I mean if they don't notice it what's the point.
Then, why? Why did you make me drive all the way out here? Why didn't you say something? Why? Why? Why?
It's a spanish dish. It's a moulage of fish, an meat with rice. Very tasty.
I just thought it would be nice. A little variety.
Yeah for two hours. She's nuts about you.
I can't. He's been on my case about not paying attention. Besides, it's too late, I already told him I heard him.
Oh, ok. Thank you. It was good talking to you.
Yeah, tell im. But quickly, Im double parked here.
Well, cause we were just saying we were going to ask you to come up to the country with us this weekend. Susan's father has a cabin up there. But, eh, all right, well.
I though we said we weren't going to discuss that now!
No, no. Deena, it's not what you think.
Can I come upstairs, please? (Elaine pushes the button and lets George in.)
Apparently the glue in the wedding invitations was a....toxic.
Right. So I call her up, I tell her its me, she gives me an enthusiastic Hi!
Hu, oh. No he thought I was hiding something from him about Morgan.
(con't) All right, you know she's got that laugh. What did you say? It's like Elmer Fudd sitting on a juicer?
Interference! You cant count that! Come on, are you crazy?! The coin cannot touch anything, it affects it.
Beautiful lineswoman. Alright listen uh I'm going to go to the concession stand and get some real sunblock. You want anything? Jerry? (Jerry is staring at the lineswoman) Jerry?
Yeah, it's bizarre. (they both look around them suspiciously)
With all due respect, I don't think so...
The show! Forget about the show! We should take the idea to a different network
Sir, I'm sure it's not a police matter.
It'll have to be a night job anyway. You don't normally work after dinner, do you?
I dont know. I cant believe theyre making me take this test.
They talk back. They go, "Hey George, how's it going?" I say, "Get the hell out of here!"
Alright! So, she said, that she could've fixed me up with her.
Well, uhm, I think I'd like to do it.
Jerry please, that's very nice, but, uh, (closes the door) where would we be going?
That's David Letterman. I just saw David Letterman walk by. I'll be right back. (He exits)
I dont know, what? Eight thousand. Its a Hyundai. Get out of here. I told you not to sell. Simons made money, Wilkinson cleaned up.
Awright, listen, can you uh, gimme a lift back to my place?
I tell you, when she threw that toupee out the window, it was the best thing that ever happened to me. I feel like my old self again. Totally inadequate, completely insecure, paranoid, neurotic, it's a pleasure.
Please. They dont do anything. Look, do I have to break up with her in person? Cant I do it over the phone? I-I have no stomach for these things.
Ehh. (nostalgic) Remember that summer at Dairy Queen where I cooled my feet in the soft-serve machine?
I'm sure he'll be back in a second.
So, you... you say you've been in the city all winter?
There's nothing I can even impart to you, that's the sad thing. It's so inborn, I can't pass it on. (begins backing into the space) Look at this guy. Are you crazy, what are you doing?! Hey! Hey, you're stealing my space!
No, no, not really. Ever since Susan passed on, I have good days and bad. (Turns the briefcase towards the woman on his left.) Some days, I'm haunted by one word - why. Why Susan? Why wasn't it me licking those invitations? Why am I still here? Well, I gotta run. (Gets up and leaves the meeting.)
I got me an appointment with a hardware store. I'm not saying I want to do it for the rest of my life, but, uh, hardware fascinates me. Don't you love to make a key?
Because of the day before. It's a long story.
What, you didn't ask him about the car?
So we had a good time... the four of us.
Oh ya, This is my fiance, Susan. This is David
No. No. No. No. No. Don't worry. It's perfectly safe. I researched it. He'll get a little woozy. He might keel over.
You want to be with somebody that doesn't like you.
Yeah. Steinbrenner wants everyone in the front office to give a lecture in their area of business expertise.
Just do it like a Band-Aid. One motion. Right off! (beat) She is sexy though. Dont you think?
Listen uh, David, I, I, I want to apologize about that comment
That's right, who the hell are they? How dare they?!
I can't carry any changes in these pants, it falls out.
All right. That's enough for today. You're tired. Get some sleep. I'll see you first thing in the morning.
Well I'm not starting up a whole new wardrobe now!!!
All these years I've been chuckin' and you've never told me?
All right. See you tomorrow. (George sighs, exits.)
And you! How many Twix does that make for you, today?! Like, 8 Twix?!
(leaving to the bedroom) I gave it to Cosmo.
Oh what's the difference? We'll all be dead eventually.
I can't believe you called me a chucker. No way I'm a chucker, I do not chuck, never chucked, never have chucked, never will chuck, no chuck!
Are you often on business trip? Nice...oh, hey nice ice-bucket.
Every summer you guys went to camp together. I was jealous. Felt like he was the summer me.
You never run out, do you? (Jerry smiles.) Where's Kramer? Everything's finished here.
I don't know where you're getting this from. I....you're serious aren't you? Oh, (laughing) you see? You see, you just don't know my sense of humor. Dan, don't I joke around all the time?
Aah, yeah, yeah. Won't you head on in, we'll be in in a second. Be right with you.
Wait a minute Jerry, there's a bigger issue here. If you go through that wall and become one of those guys I'll be left here on this side. Take me with you.
Oh, no no, I cant go back there. Jerry, its so awkward and, you know, it could be dangerous sexually. Something could happen, Id be right back where I started from.
You know, I think we really need to be in front of a television set. You take T.V. out of this relationship, it is *just* torture.
So you - you really don't have my hat?
Me either. Is there anything you can do to shut them up?
(emerging from bathroom, buttoning his shirt) A gymnast! I can't believe it, you didn't tell me she was a gymnast.
Alright, well why don't we smooth the head down to nothing, stick a pumpkin under its arm and change the nameplate to Ichabod Crane?
(Sitting on the sofa) I'm on no sleep, bro.
(to Jerry) How could we not hear anything? What's with this Russel? What's he doing? (Jerry raises his arms and shoulders like he doesn't know)
And how does the baldness fit into that plan?
Look, I am under direct orders from Mr Wilhelm. So if you have a problem with that, maybe you should just take it up with him.
Well, some of 'em look good. The ones that look good you don't even know about.
Did you see the homeless guy on the library steps screaming obsenities and doing some calesthetics routine
So you're telling me instead of them being happy to see me, they're going to be upset because I didn't bring anything. Ttst --You see what I'm saying?
There could be more than one O'Brien on a plane who ordered a limo.
Did I need that pointed out for me? What is that going to do for me? How does that help me, to see her? I'm trying to live my life. Don't show me that.
The Rosses have started up a foundation, Jerry, and I have to sit on the board of directors.
Were you just talking about me? What's going on?
Those birthdays. I told you. They're relationship killers. If a relationship is having any problems whatsoever, a birthday will always bring it out.
(Looking over the writing materials they just bought) Bics? What, d'ja get, bics?
So, I'm gonna steal another one, and then return it. That way, everything is even.
Oh, sure. Sure, anything. Can you believe it? There's nothing wrong with me.
Susan Davis? (Getting possessive) Hey, wait a second..
Did you ever go to a singles weekend in the Poconos?
(talking on the phone) Jerry you gotta bring me some clothes down here. I lost my job with the Yankees. I'm standing in the men's room on 43rd street in my underpants.
What's the difference, you're a woman. They're supposed to be touching you.
I'm sorry, umm he-here's your money back (gives Rudy the money back) I-I-I'll have the clothes.
Yeah. There's something wrong with that? I'm a character. People are always saying to me, "You know you're a quite a character."
Oh, right! (Shakes her hand) Right! Hey, hey.. I love the floors in here. It's like a gymnasium in here! Try and guard me! (Dribbles an imaginary ball
Listen, Buck, I uh...obviously I don't need to talk to you about the importance of player morale, but uh...I've been talking to some of the guys, and some of them - I don't want to mention any names - but some of them...they're not too happy with the polyester uniforms.
You know they used to make leisure suits out of this fabric?
Hey. There is a couple of people that wouldn't mind having me out of the way.
Alright, I gotta go. I'm heading over to Bonnie's.
Everybody likes pesto. You walk into a restaurant, that's all you hear - pesto, pesto, pesto.
I have never seen a Mohel like that.
You know what this has to do with?
I read somewhere that this Brentano's is the place to meet girls in New York.
(to Donna) Why did you have to get me in trouble?
It's really nothing, it's like going to the dentist.
I'm gonna get some more of these kosher cocktail franks.. (leaves)
(excited) Great news! I showed the pilot to Kramer's Japanese friends. They loved it!
Tim, who's the head of the Aryan Union, you or me?
Don't you see what this says? How can you possibly like somebody ,if you think they look like this?
What are you comparing yourself to Keith Hernandez. The guys a baseball player Jerry, Baseball!
Are you looking deep down at the real person underneath?
What were you saying to the Rosses over there, anyway?
'Just listen to the music of the traffic, in the city. Linger on the sidewalk, where the neon lights are pretty.' Where the neon lights are pretty. The Broadway area?
You see, my friend here, his aunt passed away last night.
Anyway, as I was lying in the puddle, I-I think I may have found a way for us to get Bonds and Griffey, and we wouldn't have to give up that much.
No no no, that's in the right position.
Oh, I think so, and I can prove it. You see, I was doodling on the bill and uh, so if you have a twenty in there with big lips on it... well, (smiles) that's mine. Would you mind opening up the register?
Yeah, they eh, they do a lot of baking up there.
Puke! That's a funny word. Puke. (laughing) Puke! Don't have to think about that.
Jerry ... Where are you? I know you like to sit back here. Elaine! Susan!
(spins his chair back to face her) So you got a $25,000 a year raise.
I've just met her but I'm very impressed.
Hey Elaine. (George hangs up his raincoat next to the door) Im telling you Jerry, having a secretary is incredible. (George claps hands) I don't know why I didnt have one before.
(singing as he exits florist with bouquet and a cup of coffee) "...tootsie, good-bye. Too-too, tootsie..." (takes a drink, makes a face, shouts back at shop) You call this coffee? (dumps out coffee behind him, accidentally hitting a parked car's windshield)
Don't go shouting we got a hundred dollar bill. People will be jumping out of windows on top of us.
Excuse me, darling, do I detect a Portuguese accent?
Hey, Jerry, remember Frogger? I used to be so into this game. Gettin' that frog across the street was my entire life.
Aha. Aha. Could it be because you don't want him to know that you have a friend who pees in the shower, is that it?!
Yeah, yeah. That's how they talk in the major league. (laughs)
(shouting) Turn your key, Maura. Turn your key!
Why should she like me? Who am I? Huh, there's a million people to like.
(at dinner with his cousin) Some more merlot?
Svenjolly. (licking a little bit of peanut butter from his finger)
Absolutely, uh, lets see there's, uh, Vandelay Industries, I just saw them. I got very close there. very close.
(talking to nobody) Nah. It's probably a union thing.
He scratches off a 32 and he puts in 31.
No no, I never said I was a good driver, I said I was a good parker.
I heard what you said "Sharon, are you there?".
Thank you for leaving me alone with him!
You saw him. He was fiddling with the engine. God knows what he did there.
People smoke, Elaine. My mother smoked. It didnt hurt me.
(pleading) Elaine, c'mon. Would you just make the call? (indicates the phone) Please, make the call.
The wedding is off. Now you can go to the Super Bowl.
I'll tell you something, I've never seen a pilot script as funny as this!
I'm gay! I'm a gay man! I'm very, very gay.
I am in and out of my personnel file at work all the time.
We gotta get something. I don't want to go to that meeting on an empty stomach. Let's get some Chinese. You wanna order it?
Hey, by the way, what'd you think of Miss Yoshimura?
This you are not going to believe. Al Netchie, that pimple. Tells Daphne, not get this 'Not to get involved with me.'
Ill tell you when it happened. When that floss came flying out of my pocket.
What are you talking about, that's seventy-five bucks! I'm not working, I can't afford that.
Well, I started to tell her and then all of the sudden, for some reason, I just burst into tears.
Well I don't know anyone here Jerry. Where else am I going to stay?
(on tape, singing) "Believe it or not, George, isn't at home, please leave a mes-saaage at the beep. I must be out or I'd pick up the pho-one. Where could I be? Believe it or not, I'm not hooome." (beep)
Yes, sure, surely was. Yeah, I'll remember that day. Well I'll never forget it because that was the day that I uh, lost my virginity to Miss. Stafford, the uh, voluptuous home room teacher.
My name is not mentioned in this blurb...
Who am I going to tell? My mother? Like I've got nothing better to talk about.
I saw "Titanic". So that old woman, she's just a liar, right?
Right. I don't have it on me. Allison, this is Susan. Susan, Allison.
What did you put the Pez dispenser on her leg for in the first place?
(continuing) I feel like a family. In fact, yesterday was Grace's birthday. She's such a sweet woman so, we had a little party, with cake and champagne. I made a toast.
Hey Kramer, c'mon-- it was 240 bucks twenty years ago...
There it is. Gate 46... We got plenty of time.
(surprised) So, I'm Neil? How did I do that?
Hey, Nina! (beat) I owe you some money, don't I?
Excuse me, I've got a maniac stalking me, I'm not staying in the city.
Listen to the comeback. (pleased) 'Oh yeah? Well the jerk store called. They're running outta you.'
Excuse me, are you the guy with that funny laser?
(smitten) Audrey? My god, you look incredible! I can't believe it!
Look, we're not gonna be that long anyway... we have to get to the "party"!
We just go up to him, we say, "We're O'Brien."
All right, do you mind? I have the window! (To Willie) Now, what are you gonna do about my Twix?
What's the difference? You know they way I work. I'm like a commercial jingle. First it's a little irritating, then you hear it a few times, youre hummin it in the shower, by the third date it's (sings) "By Mennen!".
How do I know, maybe, you know, maybe she wanted to be polite.
Why can't we do this on the phone? What's Kramer doing now?
Yeah, that's what I want-- triangles. Alright, I'm outta here. Have fun with what's-her-name.
He's a sports writer for the daily news. I find him very insightful...
Really? You like it? I got it at a flea market today.
Yeah. Yeah. With all that kissing and the shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy out in public like that. It's disgusting!
Hey, I just found twenty dollars! I tell you this, something is happening in my life. I did this opposite thing last night. Up was down, black was white, good was -
Ya it used to be right in the middle of single Jeopardy and now they do it right after single Jeopardy.
So you're gonna let me get suspended for shower urination?
I'm the one he wants! He's coming to settle the score.
(Not sure what the answer should be) What do you want to hear?
What's he going to do? That's exactly the point. Nobody knows what this guy is capable of! He fires people like it is a bodily function.
I guess I've been hanging on to them for so long cuz i couldn't accept the fact that Dad was really gone forever (hugs a piece of clothing)
I'm very disappointed to here you talk like that. You still don't know what makes me tick.
Hu humm? i suppose we could go to Lincoln Center and I'd be wearing sneakers and jeans and that would be fine too.
I want you to find out is she likes me.
Yes, sir, that was a good sandwich, sir.
That's what she says. I say, listen. It was an old cat. It died of natural causes. So get this, now she tells me that I gotta buy her a brand new cat. I say listen, honey. First of all, it was a pretty old cat. I'm not gonna buy you a brand new cat to replace an old dying cat. And second of all, I go out to the garbage, I find you a new cat in fifteen seconds. I say, you show me an autopsy report that says this cat died of starvation, I spring for a new cat. So she says something to me, like, uh, I dunno, get the hell out of here, and she breaks up with me. Now don't you think that would be a great case on L.A. Law?
What are you talking about.. I WANT MY CAR!!
She's playing a recital this week at the McBierney School. You wanna hear her play? I got two extra tickets, you and Elaine could go...
You see (to Jerry). You see. You see what Im talking about. It's all just slipping away. And you're letting it happen. (exits -- slamming the door)
Well, I could be a little sweetie tweetie weetie weetie.
It's that bleak? (pours a glass of milk)
My dad was a cook during the Korean War. Something very bad happened, ever since you can't get him near a kitchen.
I bawled uncontrollably. I just poured my guts out. And I'll tell you, Jerry, it was incredible. I never realized how powerful these tears are. I could have postponed it another five years if I wanted to.
Pretend you didn't know it was there. Can you see it?
Yeah. Eric the Clown put it out with his big shoe.
Can I say one thing to you? And I say this with an unblemished record of staunch heterosexuality.
So, attractive one day - not attractive the next?
(sarcasm) Hu-hu, like I don't know that? (excitement) My Cousin Vinnie, I love that! I, George Costanza, could be on a date with an Oscar winner! An Oscar winner, Jerry! You know what that's like? It's like if fifty years ago, someone fixed me up with Katherine Hepburn? Same thing!
(from bathroom) How was Eric Roberts as the husband?
(singing) Lemon tree, very pretty and a lemon flower...
I'm not crying. And I shouldn't have said that about your wife. Please accept my apologies.
I change I change. Two weeks ago I tried a soft boiled egg. Never liked it before. Now I'm dunkin a piece of toast in there and I'm loving it.
(Motioning toward waitress) I think she likes me.
(to Jay) What do you think it is?
Cmon, go for twenty-five hundred. Well do it together. Come on, come on. Were in it together.
That's where I come in. Umm, on splat. Uh, you see, Mrs. Sweedler, or is it hospital administrator Sweedler?
Ten minutes! Here, here, (Fishes a box of Tic-Tacs out of his coat pocket and tosses them to her) Have some Tic-Tacs.
Oh yeah the nipple. But besides that. How did you feel about Kramer's work?
See, this should be a show. This is the show.
(laughs hysterically, gesticulating wildly) This is all blowing up in my face! My serious girlfriend, and my torrid love affair have accidentally crossed paths. I have ruined three lives... (grabbing coat) Well, I understand if you never want to see me again, so... (points towards door)
Oh, these are my friends, Elaine and Jerry, ... Noel
(annoyed) Hes an importer/exporter, okay? (beat) Elaine ever call you back?
(grabbing the sweater back) Well it's not really damaged. 85 dollars huh?
No, I brought a picture of the chair.
Yeah, I should do the opposite, I should.
Well what if she calls me? What am I supposed to say?! (hand hits the table)
Why is what I do is so important? Why must I be always the focal point of attention? Let me just be, let me live.
Does she walk around holding a pen she never seems to need?
(resolved) Why not. (determined) If she can't find me, she can't break up with me. And, if we're still goin' out, she has to gooo to the ballll.
I couldn't help it! Elaine moved the mirror, I got discombobulated.
How much tip do you leave on $8.15?
No, occasionally I'll forget to let the machine pick up. Anyway, they made this large donation, to a women's prison, and I get to go down there and check it out.
Really, I was, I was only kidding around.
She invites me up at twelve oclock at night, for coffee, and I dont go up. No thank you. I dont want coffee. It keeps me up. Too late for me to drink coffee. I said this to her. People this stupid shouldnt be allowed to live. I cant imagine what she must think of me.
A guy leaves a puddle of sweat, that's a signal?
What's the difference you just read it and mail it right back. These we'll do.
I know they're in there, the three of them, laughing at me. Together, laughing and lying.
How would you find out something like that...wait a minute, what am I thinking? I've got the entire Yankee organization at my disposal.
I think I'd be good at that. I talk to people all the time. Someone even told me once they thought I'd be a good talk show host.
(upset) Well, you've scared her off. We may never see mom again.
Shes an... etymologist. You know, bees, flies, gnats. W-What about you?
All I know about is sports. That's it. No matter how depressed I get, I could always read the sports section.
And the amazing thing is she eats like there's no tomorra'. I mean I've never seen an appetite like this. Desserts. Everything. I don't know how she does it.
It was fantastic, Jerry. We wound up talking all night.
That's uh, KL5-8383. Are you calling them soon because, they keep very strange hours.
[Realizing full well it isn't] ...Yes it is.
Where you going? I-I thought I could count on you for a little compassion.
That's a very good question. You know she and I go out for dinner, she doesn't even reach for the check. That?s all I?m asking for is a reach. Is that so much to ask for?
Because you called her by the wrong name.
I can never get the package open in time.
Maybe you don't have to be so funny. I mean, would it kill you not to be so funny all the time? That's all I'm asking. This woman thinks I'm very funny. Now you're gonna be funny, so what am I gonna be? I'm gonna be a short bald guy with glasses who suddenly doesn't seem so funny.
I gotta find a way to work this out, I love that apartment. It's so cozy, I'm ensconced in velvet. You know, if it were socially acceptable--
Look at that. They got lobster on the menu. Who would order a lobster here. I mean, do they bring a lobster in everyday hoping *todays* the day.
But if you think about it...26 teams, 162 games a season, you'd think eventually an entire team would get wiped out.
(he walks casually to Tom, and taps his arm) Listen. I know we've had our problems in the past, but we got a show to do tonight. Time to pull together as a team. Life's too short. I say, let's let bygones be bygones. If you took the raisins, if you didn't take the raisins-- They weren't even my raisins. I was just curious because it seems like a strange to do to walk into a room, audition, and to walk out with a box of raisins. Anyway, whatever. If you ever want to tell me about it, the door to my office is always opened. In the event that I get an office. You'll come in, we'll talk about the raisins. We'll have a nice laugh.
Amazing. I drive them to lesbianism, he brings 'em back.
You disappoint me, my friend. Sandy wants nothing to do with you. She tells Laura, "If you want to waste your time with that pervert, that's your problem."
You'll have your turn! The truth must be heard. (Plays back the tape.) That's all there was. And yet, it speaks volumes. A low rumple. A metallic 'squink.' A 'glonk.' Someone crying out..."Dear God!" Let's start with, uh...with you, Wyck.
I told them I have a place in the Hamptons. What did you say?
I can't believe you're really going out with a woman named Lois.
Ah, well, you know we gotta been running because of the ...
Let me ask you a question. This new move. Is there a knuckle involved in any way?
(stops Jerry realizing something) Hey hey hey hey hey hey.
Oh, yeah, sure, accident, right. She was aiming right at me like she was putting out a fire! Then, for the rest of the show, I'm sitting there with chocolate all over my shirt. Flies are landing on me. I'm boiling - I'm fantasizing all the things I'm gonna say when I see her. And later, finally, backstage when I talk to her, I'm a groveling worm. "What kind of chocolate was that? Do you throw any other foods?"
I don't think I could do it. You know, they always remember the first time. I don't want to be remembered. I wanna be forgotten.
I would give anything to be going up those stairs again.
Ah, see, Mister.. I didn't write that report. That, that's not mine.
She dragged me down to that warehouse on the waterfront in Brooklin to see one of her "performances".
That?s not the issue, we're friends, if I?ve got to be uncomfortable, you've got to be uncomfortable too!
All right, enough! Enough! From now on, no more yada yada's. Just give me the full story.
(nervous) Where are you taking me? I was gonna pay for it.
I knew this was gonna happen some day. It was inevitable. I've known it ever since I was a little kid. I've been waiting for it.
I don't understand lunch, I don't know anything about lunch. Listen. Just because I got the guy fired doesn't mean I turned him into a bum - does it?
Ill eh, Ill just have a bowl of chili.
if you hadn't come, this whole thing wouldn't have happen (back on Jerry and Elaine's side, we can hear George saying "I was the one who was invited", Jerry opens the door)
Yes. And listen to this, listen to this; her uncle works for the Yankees and he's gonna get me a job interview. A front office kind of thing. Assistant to the traveling secretary. A job with the New York Yankees! This has been the dream of my life ever since I was a child, and it's all happening because I'm completely ignoring every urge towards common sense and good judgment I have had. This is no longer just some crazy notion. Elaine, Jerry, this is my religion.
I told them to meet me in front of my building at six-fifteen.
What do you know? You were in the nut house.
The little extra moan you threw in there. Laying it on a bit thick, don't you think?
What are we gonna tell Jerry about the car?
Wait a minute? He's picking up the van tonight? This is perfect. I'll drive Rhisa to someplace romantic. Then when my father slides the door open, I'm in the van kissing his brother's daughter.
Sir, I just got a call from the terrorist. I told him to call back here.
It - it's just that I'm here with my parents, and my mother wants me to take a civil service test - and to tell you the truth, I don't even think I'd pass it.. So..
I never heard of anyone would turned down an apartment because of a weak shower spray.
My parents. It's their anniversary. I'm taking them out to dinner and a show tonight. You think we'll hit traffic?
Assistant to the travelling secretary. (fishing for a reaction) I'm uh, working on the project.
I'd like to say it once to someone that can actually hear it!
I hate asking for change. They always make a face. Like I'm asking them to donate a kidney.
Forget it? I already called my parents. I told them to expect the surprise of a lifetime. My mothers making her roasted potatoes!
Well, I'm also an architect. Is that pastrami?
Shhh What is wrong with you? You never tell 'em you like the car. (Advising) You're not sure what you want. You don't even know why you're here.
Yeah! Look at me! I was free and clear! I was living the dream! I was stripped to the waist, eating a block of cheese the size of a car battery!
What, you think I eat all my meals with you? (To waitress) Excuse me, sweetheart? I think you may have overcharged us. What is this?
Let me tell you something. No one walks into a beauty parlor and says "Give me the Larry Fine."
I dont want to get out of it.
It's just that I was the one who actually paid for the big salad. She just happened to hand it to you. But it's no big deal.
(agitated) He's lying, sir! I'm tired of all your macho head games!
Krama. Open up! I--I know you're in there!
(jokingly) You are still paying for this lunch?
In any other shoe, I lose two inches. I - I can't have a drop down. We were eye to eye, I can't go eye to chin!
What's it gonna be? ... You hear that?
We did a crossword puzzle together, *in bed*. It was the most fun I ever had in my entire life. Did you hear me? in my *life*! Y'know?
One of the guys in my cell threw a piece of gum at him.
Everybody's talkin' at me...I can't hear a word they're sayin'...just drivin' around in Jon Voight's car...
"I have to go see Steinbrenner later. Mr Wilhelm told him that I was the one responsable for stealing all the merchandise."
I wanna know what I did to this woman.
She's too tanned. It's the middle of the winter, she's like a carrot.
Oh, no no no -- We bought the wine here before, but now, you know we're bl-blocked in by some car double parked and we're just waiting for the guy to pull out.
Nah, nah, it's uh, it's a long story. Just uh, try to get it up.
Why don't you give me the twenty, and I'll stop and get change, and then you and I can... uh... you-know, settle.
Must be one of those rich, spoiled handicapped people, who didn't want to do any work, and just wanted to sit in her wheelchair and take it easy.
I love these people, you can't ask 'em questions. (getting excited) They're so mentally gifted that we mustn't disturb the delicate genius unless it's in the confines of an office. (worked up) When huge sums of money are involved, then the delicate genius can be disturbed!
Now she thinks we're gay, not that there's anything wrong with it...
Anyway, again, I'm sorry about throwing you out of the car.
Yes, it was purple, I liked it, I dont actually recall considering the buttons.
No, Julie, Julie, don't insult me. You know, what difference does it make who pays for lunch. It's totally meaningless.
Not really. Your voice kind of raises to this comedic pitch. (Kramer enters)
I keep wracking my brain to try and figure out what I did. I was smart, I was funny, I made great small talk with the waitress so she could see I could relate to the commoners, you know, I'm a man of the people.
What if he left you a used Kleenex, what's that, a valentine? Now you go up to him and you tell him that if he's thinking of turning me in, that I got the goods on him!
Elaine? It's me, George. (Elaine opens the door.) Hey, sorry to bother you so late. (To Billy) Hey! How ya doin.' (To Elaine) Uh, did you get any of those sponges?
What kind of money you think your parents have?
(getting animated) Yeah. Yeah. You know the odds of me being anyone's type?! I have never been anyone's type, but apparently, this Marisa Tomei loves funny, quirky, bald men.
She might be leaving to work any minute.
But really, it's enough with the bar already.
I got to give the players most of the credit for that.
Look, Deena, I know you think I'm crazy, but I'm not. This is just a series of bad coincidences.
He knows I'm waiting. He sees me. He just doesn't wanna look.
I don't understand what the big deal is. They let you try on pants.
You're Killing Independent George! You know that, don't you?
No, no, no we'll talk about it later.
Well how could you just play your message in front of anybody?
Great! I ate the entire platter! Had to call in sick today.
Well, you know, I was thinking about what you said before, and...you're right, I've never really been a couple, so...if that's the rule, then I'm gonna go by the rule.
What the hell is this? George, Elaine and I went to see Chunnel ... with Jerry. With Jerry, huh? With Jerry! Great. Great! (dials phone) Probably went to the 84th St. That's where I always go with Jerry.
If I do it, will you buy a computer?
So what do you care what she thinks.
Greetings, people. Greetings. Greetings and salutations. What a beautiful day for a ball game. Let's play two! (Sits down, says to waitress ) Oh, I'll have the chicken salad on rye, my usual, you know what I get, darlin'. (Turns to the Gang) So, let's see, I had a little conversation today with Mr Don Mattingly - (to Elaine) he's the first base man.
I think Im getting tired of it. I mean is that all it does? Hello? La-la-la?
Im keeping it. Im going down with the ship.
Because my parents happen to be two pretty wonderful people.
Let me be the architect! I can do it!
(Smiling to himself) You don't have to worry about me. (Nodding, gloating) I won a contest.
You know, Einstein wore the exact same outfit every day.
Well, if it's as good as ``Ponce de Leon'', I'll be happy.
Ever since I found out that you let that message on Jerry's tape recorder I...
You're not out there! You can't be, because *I* am out there. And if I see *you* out there, there's not enough voltage in this world to electroshock me back into coherence!
Behind the dugout, that's where we were sitting the other day.
(adamant) It's not cheating if there's no sex!
Look at that guy. Right there. Isn't that the guy from the show? He's..he's wearing the jacket.
Oh, yes I am. Mr. Thomassoulo likes to play dirty. Well, theres nothing dirtier than a giant ball of oil.
No. Semi-daily. Four or five times a week.
It is a horrible company. There's no management what so ever. I could go hog wild in there.
(upset) But you can't stay here. There's no place to sleep!
"Hey listen, let me give you my card. It's got my home number on it. I want to buy the first pair when the next shipment comes in."
(to various people as he walks in) Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Hi nice to see you. How are you. Good morning. (to the secretary) Good morning.
A fan? I would drape myself in velvet if it were socially acceptable. And look at this, hardwood floors!
Oh, yeah? Holistic.. that's what I need. That's the answer.
You know how easy it is for dead people to travel? Its not like getting on a bus. One second. (snaps his fingers) Its all mental.
Pst. (moves in close with Elaine and Jerry) Wilkinsons got a bite on a new one. Petramco Corp. Out of, uh Springfield. I think. Theyre about to introduce some sort of a robot butcher.
(taking the phone from Elaine) Jerry, why is Elaine getting your mail?
Now, you see, I don't get that. We had a relaxed stimulating, great conversation, she doesn't mention it? Why doesn't she mention it?
All right, no more lies. Elaine is been chosen to represent the Upper West Side in the next Biosphere project.
Lets not forget the radiator. The steam has been on here for ten years. No human can turn this off.
Anyway, I-I would like to-to pay for the cleaning.
Ho ho ho ho! I can't wait for Hanke to come crawling back to me.
She supports her whole family. (walking slowly into the room)
My heart! My heart! (To Assistant) Where you going? Are you crazy?!
So concerned was he, that word of his poor tennis skills might leak out, he chose to offer you his wife as some sort of mediaeval sexual payola?
Could there be a native p0roblem in the Caymans? Maybe theres native unrest.
Hey, so, did you give that radio the old switcheroo?
I thought you said he was gonna get a muffin.
No I didn't mean to imply that you did. You're obviously a very well proportioned individual. I was just wondering, have they ever offered you a chair?
(Struggling) No, no, no, no. I can walk it off. It's a hundred and twenty degrees in here.. I'll sweat it out.
Yeah. The thing is, I, uh...I had this little zinger of my own I wanted to try.
And who's responsible for making hate mongering and fascism popular again?
Atlantic City? (thinks) Yes! Yes! I will go to Atlantic City. I'm in. I'm down.
Lesbian wedding. How do they work bride and groom out, what do they flip a coin?
Well what if I told you I'm thinking of moving here?
(To a passing waitress) I'll have some coffee and a doughnut.
Yeah, yeah. She's seeing this guy, Art Vandelay.
That's dynamite. Yeah, I'll look for the Chinese food leftovers.
$2? But everyone in front of me got free bread.
I have no power Do you understand? I need hand. I have no hand.
This is very hard to follow with all the talking.
Yeah. It's a beautiful name for a boy or a girl...
All I want is my seventy-five cents back, an apology, and for him to be fired!
So what, he's got a couple of good jokes.
Not with that big glass window looking out into the hall. I'd love a good nap. That's the only thing getting me out of bed in the morning. I'll see ya'.
Yeah, but if you still look closely you can see ah, a little bump where the nose use to be. huhuhuhu.
Didja see the way she was looking at me?
Well, we're collectors. We, uh, see objects of great beauty and, uh, we must have them.
So what! Have a yoke! It won't kill you.
No, that's not enough BTUs for my living room...That was a complete waste of time.
(Shocked) She's pregnant? Leslie is pregnant?! Oh, see, there is no justice.
Where did I get the coffee? Where do think I got the coffee, at the grocery store. (small laugh)
Sometimes in life, the gods smile upon you, my friends.
I guess that leaves me in the clear...
Oh my God. I must be crazy. What have I done?
What, you don't want me to hold your keys?
Wow, Keith Hernandez. He's such a great player.
I'm not her boyfriend. I want to be her boyfriend.
Uh, uh, yeah. Actually, the, uh, I-I bumped my elbow on a desk and uh injured something an.. now it sort of moves involuntarily.
Ah, you still going on in front of Bania, eh?
Oh, uh, "The Falconer" by John Cheever. It's really excellent.
Lo..k, if you want to taste mine, you don't have to offer me some of yours.
(playing with toys) Ahhhh, Yes! Touch down! Your turn, Jerry. (hands Jerry the Mattel Football. George starts playing with the Etch-a-sketch.)
If I could talk to the guy for just a sec...
So I set up a screening, everyone takes their shirt off and click, I snap me a shot of a bear-chested Kruger.
No, no. It wasn't a shift, I've shifted, this was a move.
She knew I didnt have a job, she knew I lived at home. Didnt seem to bother her. I think I could have married this woman.
Look at me! I am man! I am you!
Her back went out. She's gotta be there for a couple of days. All she said on the way over in the car was, "Why, George, why?!".. I said, "Because it's there!"
Alright, whatever! Now. Whatever caused the damage...(drops a tiny briefcase onto the table in the model)...was jarring enough to completely stop the tape.
Can't find them. That's marvelous. The dance continues.
(Quick, excited talking) Hey, hey! You can't believe this. Look at this check! (Hands it to Jerry) They told me I had the most beautiful hands they'd ever seen in their lives - except for this McKigney guy - this great looking girl gave me her phone number.. I got it! I got it all! I'm busting. Jerry, I'm busting!
So... uh you feel okay about that whole thing... what we do in there... you're generally okay with everything in there?
Hey, people, people, people, people, people. Not bad, huh? Excuse me.
I still have it. The collar's okay. I wear it under sweaters.
Eh, there's that woman that never talks to anybody.
Youre doomed. Youre gonna have to have all your sex at womens apartments. Itll be like a permanent road trip. Forget about the home bed advantage.
me too, I am down, I am totally down, mark me down
What happened to the pact? We were both gonna change. We shook hands on a pact. Did you not shake my hand on it uh?
Psh. What's the point of even discussing it? [condescendingly takes her hand and pats it] You'll give me the money when you have it. [takes two steps, then reconsiders, then re-reconsiders] I, I trust you.
Ripe. Boy, this Joe's got some terrific fruit.
Come on, wanna give me a hand with the computers?
I was in there for two minutes. He didnt do anything. Touch this, feel that  seventy-five bucks!
This...is an organizer, a secretary, and a friend.
[trying to act as if he doesn't care one way or the other, but we know better] Either way.
(little worried) Coffee? (thinks) I can beat that. Move in with me.
You should have somebody take a look at that.
Do I really have to buy her something?
(shouts) Awright already!! This is a very key issue with me, Jerry. I had this name for a long time.
I just wanted to talk to him for a minute, but Ill come back.
Loves bald? (laughs) Wow. Who uh, who is she?
To do what?! Work in a post office? Is that what you want me to do?
This could be in a museum some day! It's not safe with me! It should really be in a doormanned building.
She doesn't like. Here is your blue one, it's her favorite. (Takes sweater out of his bag.)
No...no...no, I hate to tell you this. Youre not gonna see this woman.
Hey, hey, let's not get so defensive here. This is a give and take process.
Yeah, the oceans really are getting very sudsy.
(indicating the window) Kramer, it's, it's raining. They got the tarp on the field.
(Stern, angered) I hope so. (Takes the scissors)
Eh, listen Mr. Kruger, I got a message from Dr. Van Nostrand and he says it might be wise to you to see another doctor about that mole.
we rode along all the way to the hospital
The... drivel... parts. Oh my gosh, I just realized  I have to make a phone call. I-I cant believe- Would you-
We'll have 2 slices and 2 grape sodas.
Yes they did. I was covering. Elaine has been deported back to Scotland.
Right, can we go? Cause Im double-parked, Im gonna get a ticket.
We could build a cabin like (Snaps) that.
(hesitant) Uh, Mr Wilhelm. Uh, about the project...
Gone. (Moves over to a chair in the living room. Kramer takes the carton of food to the table, and begins eating) The tenant association made me give it to this guy because he was an Andrea Doria survivor..
And I can make a left turn from the right lane too.
You mean a walk back in? That's the toughest move in the business. You're sending me out into no-mans-land, and if I get shot down I have to crawl all the way back. Well I can't do it! I can't do it, I tell ya!
Well, Danielle, (digs in his pocket) we should get going. I got a key made for you.
Wait, as a matter of fact, wasn't there some guy in your building that you said you liked? He lived up on the fifth floor or something.
So this Anna called me from out of the blue.
I love this place. You know, Carl and I come here all the time.
What are you talking about? How can you sit there and look me in the eye and tell that me you're not worried?! Don't you have any *sense*?!! Don't you have a brain!? Are you so completely senile that you don't know what you're talkin about Anymore!!?!
(to himself) A cane. I knew it. (to Neil) So, we meet at last. I admire your skills, Mr Peanut.
Oh yeah. So wait, wait. A half-hour later Im back in the office, I tell Lloyd the whole story. He says, So why dont you call her? I says, I cant. I couldnt, I couldnt do it right then. For me to ask a woman out I gotta get into a mental state like the karate guys before they break the bricks. So Lloyd calls me a wuss.
It became very clear to me sitting out there today, that every decision I've ever made, in my entire life, has been wrong. My life is the complete opposite of everything I want it to be. Every instinct I have, in every of aspect of life, be it something to wear, something to eat ... It's all been wrong. (chuckles) Everywhere.
(to Jerry) You watch the old videos. (insistent) I'm telling you, look at him.
Alright, what's the difference. What are we gonna do now? He won't take our calls, we can't get into his office...
(delighted) Jerry? It was incredible! Models! As far as the eye could see!
And I didnt even ask her out. She asked me out first. She called me up. What was I supposed to do? Say no? (laughs) I cant do that to someone.
(frustrated) Oh, look at this. There's no place to park around here. I don't even know why they sell cars in Manhattan.
I wonder what toilet paper was loike in the 1860's. Did they carry it in rolls in their duffle bags?
So who am I to be thinking about someone's nose? I mean, I should be grateful someone like her even looks at me. I have no job, nothing. But I have to say, I think about the nose. I don't want to think about the nose. I don't ask to think about the nose, but I think about it. I go to bed at night, I tell myself, 'Don't think about the nose, forget the nose,' but I think about it. I look at her, I see nose.
No no, this is a matter of principle. That would just be saying that anybody could just pull into any parking space any way they want. Well I'm making a stand here. I'm saying *no* to head first parking. I'm not putting up with that. We put up with too much crap in this city, we're not putting up with head first parking.
I was supposed to see her. She wasn't supposed to see me.
You had to hop! You had to hop on the plane.
You know, I'm sorry, I...I hate to be one of those people, but we're right in the middle of this thing...I can't hear.
Well, if she keeps horsing around with that tractor--
Whooo.. (To a waitress taking orders) Ooh.. French fries.
There's an easy move go from screwin' you behind your back to screwin' you right to your face.
Well, people never give a good 'hello' at a funeral. I mean, they go like this (George gives an extremely understated nod) That's the biggest.
Listen to this. Marcy comes up and she tells me her ex-boyfriend was over late last night, and "yada yada yada, I'm really tired today." You don't think she yada yada'd sex.
We're perfect. I timed this out so we would pull up at the terminal *exactly* 17 minutes after their flight is supposed to land. That gives them just enough time to get off the plane, pick up their bags and be walking *out* of the terminal as we roll up. I tell you, it's a thing of beauty. I can not express to you the feeling I get from a perfect airport pickup. (starts looking around) What's going on? What are you doing? The Long Island Expressway? What are you getting on the Long Island Expressway for? Do you know what the traffic will be like? This is a suicide mission!
(energetically) "Well seems it's about time for George's lunch."
I'm sure I have a low IQ. I've been lying about my SAT scores for 15 years.
Chamberlind, you could hold his head in nthe toilet, he'd still give you half of Europe.
So what happened? She throw you out? Eh?
Yeah, of course she did. That's all I ever heard growing up is 'Why can't you be more like Lloyd Braun?' Did you know he was in a mental institution?
I dont know. But Simons said that if I wanted to get involved, that Wilkinson would tell me the exact right minute to sell. You wanna do it?
(attempting sincerity) As much as I'd like to see the two of you living it up in a warm, tropical, setting, I, I would just miss you too much. (smiling) So, I've decided, I want you to stay.
(While pointing at Jerry) Not me! Him! His fault! He betrayed me!
Hi, I was just uh... I just had one little question about uh, my assignment.
Yeaah, beautiful... (They try to hit a high five, but George hits Elaine in the forehead.) Sorry...
(To Susan) I told you it looked like her..
Whatever. (George looks to the table) Hey new tape recorder?
All right, let me just... I'm gonna grap an apple.
No, and you weren't funny last night either. In fact, you got us both so depressed, she asked me to drive her home after dinner.
Oh, there's better, (pointing at the row in front of them) right there, that's better.
Anyway, I was thinking about what you said. About uh, me and Marisa.
See her tonight. See her tomorrow. Go. Knock yourself out. Shes too crazy for me.
If youre a spirit, and you can travel to other dimensions and galaxies, and find out the mysteries of the universe, you think shes gonna wanna hang around Drexlers funeral home on Ocean Parkway?
I'm family. I'm having sex with the cousin!
(Outraged) "That's all"?! That's everything! I don't know what all the rest of it is for anyway!
But Mr. Steinbrenner, how can I be expected to perform my job properly, knowing that my uh, subordinate is making more money than I am? With all due respect sir, it's outta whack.
(ignoring Jerry) I mean I'm not really working right now.
Come on, how hard is that? Look at all the junk that's on TV. You want an idea? Here's an idea. You coach gymnastics team in high school. And you're married. And your son's not interested in gymnastics and you're pushing him into gymnastics.
So, I guess I was lucky that I never tried that myself.
Yeah, I want to see if there's anything I can do.. maybe get him another job.. maybe I'll hear of something.
(on tape, lifeless) Hey, it's George. I got nothin' to say... (beep)
Would you wait a second? Just wait? (They fight over it.)
Well, Marisa. See, the thing is... I'm sort of engaged.
Uh, twice what youre payin here, but its a great building. Its two bedrooms!
(to himself, resentful) What kind of a snobby, stuck-up, cult is this?!
Well, sure Joey, sure, I would be thrilled.
(thinking) Oh my God, it's 701. What have I done? My whole plan is depending on Kramer? Have I learned nothing? How could I make such a stupid mistake? He'll never show up!
Yeah, sure. (big smile) Then my father will have no place to sleep. (snaps fingers) He's gotta move out.
(getting up and leaving) Alright! That's it for me. Goodnight everybody.
Oh, you know, Lloyd, I really don't have it.
You mean just going there because I'm invited, that's rude?
Every night at six-thirty. The nurse was gorgeous.. then I got a look at the patient.. (Laughs, then snorts) I was going nuts.
What are you doing?...She had those nuts in her mouth, she just spit them out.
(animated) What're you kidding me? We were all getting along so well. Where is all this coming from?
They're all the same. You go, you sit, you eat popcorn, you watch. I'm sick of it.
(As the Twix starts to move) Ha, ha, ha, ha! (The Twix gets stuck in the spindle right before falling. George begins to pound the machine) Come on! Jump!
And that was wrong, Jerry! You simple must to apologize..
All right. Okay, tell me what you think about this idea Extend the doors on the toilet stalls at Yankee Stadium all the way to the floor.
Stop it, stop it! It's not fair. It's not fair. I don't like this situation, Jerry. I don't like it one bit.
Where are you meeting these women? When they get off the bus at the port authority?
What idea? I just said something. I didn't know you were going to listen to me.
Come on. We got all day tomorrow to come up with a story.
--Astroturf? You know who's responsible for that, don't you?! The Jews! Ah, the Jews hate grass. They always have, they always will.
Anyway, I think the guy in the shower opposite saw me. He gave me a dirty look.
"To the victor goes the spoils." What are you going to do tonight?
Oh! euh.. Yeah We just can't go to the supermarket to get some candy.
(Not amused with her answer) Eggs are eggs. That is very profound. (laughs; Daphne goes back to reading her paper) By the same token you could say fish is fish. Ha ha ha, I don't think so. (pauses) Listen Dophne
Okay, Okay. Who do you think you're talking to? What are ya' you trying to make a joke, because it's not funny. I can tell you that.
You said the guy gave you an open-lipped kiss!
(Standing up) I just got here, Ma! I'd like to spend a little time with you.
Its unbelievable. You know what else is unbelievable? I picked up the check. She didnt even offer. She ended it. The least she could do is send me off with a sandwich.
I was so shocked I was lucky I said anything.
Well, you know, I gotta go to, uh, Susan's parent's house for dinner.. and, you know, I want to shower first.. and I want to leave myself plenty of time.
Hi, we're from the United Volunteers, we've come to pick up the TV.
(Again, sarcastic) Oh, what a huge blow to the culture.
(Sarcastically) What's the competition, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang?
So you don't speak *any* English at all?
(To himself) How am I gonna do this? I'm engaged to this woman? She doesn't even like me. Change the subject? Toilets were the subject. We don't even share the same interests.
(to Carrie) You know, the thing is, I kinda promised the widow Mantle that I would name my baby Seven.
You know, I cant believe youre bringin in an extra bed for woman that wants to sleep with you. Why dont you bring in an extra guy too?
Knock it off, just sit in your seat over there you're distracting me. We're making incredible time here. I once went into Kennedy Airport from West 81st Street to in uh, in 15 minutes. hu uh. Oh, here hold this. It's uh, ten dollars for the tolls.
You are a good friend. You know what? Even if you killed somebody I wouldn't turn you in.
I wasn't going to say anything, but then I could see that he wasn't going to open his mouth. (Chuckles)
Nah, with crutches it's a funny story, with a cane it's a sad story. You through with those?
The network executive. You think she liked me?
Oh (snorts) Articulate....Me? I've never articulated anything, i'm completely incoherent.
There was no meeting. (gets one of the folding chairs) But it was quite a meeting. You are looking at the next director of Mets scouting. The only thing is, I have to get fired from the Yankees first.
It's a foreign movie... a *film*, is what it is, actually.
Well, I - I could, Uh, I could give the money back. Here. (Holds it out)
I don't even know her sister but believe me, if she's getting traffic tickets, she's not that good-looking! Woah
I just wanted to tell you that I really enjoyed Fair Game. I thought it was just brilliant.
(Puts his hands on his face, rubbing his eyes) Look. It's a skill, just like juggling. She probably enjoys showing it off.
Funny, cause I happen to be very good friends with Keith Hernandez.
Of course. But I really wanna leave my mark this time, you know, uh. I wanna walk away from the Yankees with people saying 'Wow! Now that guy got canned!'
(fever pitch) Marisa Tomei's sitting home, Elaine! Wh..why didn't you tell me that Katy was friends with Marisa Tomei?!
Okay, what about a nice frame? With a picture of another guy in it. Frame says I care for you, but if you wanna get serious, perhaps you'd be interested in someone like this.
I said, Listen Marlene, and then the next thing I know, Im in the middle of it. And theres this voice inside of me going, Youre doing it! Youre doing it! And then she started to cry, and I weakened a bit. I almost relented, but the voice, Jerry, the voice said, Keep going, keep going. Youre almost out! Its like I was making a prison break, you know, and Im heading for the wall, and I trip and I twist my ankle, and they throw the light on you, you know. So, somehow I get though the crying and I keep running. Then the cursing started. Shes firing at me from the guard tower. Son of a bang! Son of a boom! I get to the top of the wall  the front door. I opened it up, Im one foot away, I took one last look around the penitentiary, and I jumped!
I'll fake an illness. (Acts it out) My back! My back! I can't believe, my back.
Its amazing. We, we both have dates on the same night. I cant remember the last time that happened.
I didn't even know it was a job.
You got hookers turning tricks in my car. How's that for starters.
oh, . . .because she handed you the bag. I could have handed you the bag. She happened to pick it up at the restaurant even though, . . .
Hello, it's Natalie? Yeah, this is a business office but I'm not a business man per se. I'm here working for the people. Yes, I'm causing dissent. Stirring the pot. Getting people to question the whole rotten system.
Jerry, I've been preparing for this moment my entire life.
This is not good. This is not good.
Is there any work being done? Is there any rubbing, touching, finger manipulation on the other person, and if so, who's making the request?
Well I don't think she is a multiple sneezer, because she sneezed again later, and it was also a single.
I, uh, just think it's a little unusual. Two people to sit on one side...and leave the other side empty.
Yep. Classic horseshoe pattern. I've seen a lot of this.
Oh, no. No. No. No. No. Nothing. I'm fine. Everything's fine. Fine. Just get a little nervous on the weekends, that's all. Could I, uh, could I get a glass of water?
All right, shes not even gonna ask, if we see her, which is remote.
OK, OK, I never even had him for gym.
Yes, well, I sat down with Mr. Steinbrenner. I told him you have been doing great work. I said that you deserved a raise, and if you didnt get it, that I, was leaving. (motions with both arms in a circular motion to his right)
I left it at Heather's. Are these alive? (pounding on glass display)
(Watching the mechanic leave) I know about the vein! I cant believe this guy..
I am not putting it in a garage, it's my space.
I had no Idea you were filled with such....sexuality..
Y'know... I could hear you on the other line...
(jokingly) Well, so, legally, I could marry your daughter.
I'll tell you what's wrong, a grown woman with a male roommate! It's unnatural, it's an abomination!
No, no. I reached down and there was *nothing* there.
I have to do this, it's a matter of honor.
Oh well, gracias El Commandante, gracias. Muy muy.
What? The guy asked you to HELP HIM MOVE? Wow.
Yeah, sure. I was showing a condo on 48th street. Besides, you think I wanna miss this? (chuckles)
You should've seen her face. It was the exact same look my father gave me when I told him I wanted to be a ventriloquist.
I know, but don't say anything to anyone. He told me not to tell you.
Why? What's wrong with the subject? This is a bad subject?
It's "Guys And *Dolls*", not "Guys And *Guys*".
I watched "Beaches" on cable last night. (wings?)  Give me a break.
I'll fight ya! Not the face! Not the face! (The struggle continues.)
I once told a woman that I really enjoy spending time with my family.
Oh, very refreshing. (Thinking again) Sex is like joining a private club. I'll be the same me tomorrow, but suddenly, the no trespassing sign will be gone.
Hey, I am not here for rage. I'm here for revenge.
All right, all right, one more time, one more time! What was the exact phrasing of the request?
I...I...write a letter and then I..I go to China. I disappear in a sea of people for like six months, a year you know just while things simmer down. Ehm.. Ehm...Dear Susan. I'm sorry. I made a terrible mistake. I'm really , really sorry.
And I'm moving out of my parents' house, I'm taking that apartment on 86th street, remember the one we saw?
Well, I don't see how I'm gonna make December. I mean, I need a little more time. I mean, look at me I'm a nervous wreck. My stomach aches. My neck is killing me. I can't turn. Look. Look.
I should've hit the little son-of-a-bitch. I can't stand kids. Adults think it's so wonderful how honest kids are. I don't need that kind of honesty. I'll take a deceptive adult over an honest kid any day.
What do you mean not goin'? Come on, we got plans here. Call her up.
(urgent) Move a pinkie, if it's yes. Can you move a pinkie?
A different name for the butler? (Russell throws up again.)
kissed me. We both had tears streaming down our faces. I never saw anyone so beautiful. It was at that moment that I decided to tell her that, I was not a marine biologist.
I look like me and I'm working from the outside. Who do you think is in the better position?
So I still haven't heard about that job.
I guess she did. He's gone, now I'm the man.
It was an inferno in there! An inferno! (Eric, Robin's mother, and all the kids rush at George.)
I don't think so I know so, Kramer, come here I got to talk to you
I know a little. Besides, what do you have to know?
Now I know what I am supposed to do. It's so simple. Tell the truth That's all. Just tell the truth
(Eating) Oh yeah. These are fantastic, fantastic. (To server) You know, I'd love to get a jump on the next batch, where do you come out? (Server leaves) (To Anna) She's been ignoring this section all night. Quesadilla?
Yes a cruise, a long cruise, just the two of you.
The point is, however it got done, it's done. So, any luck with the car?
Theres just no justice. This experience has changed me. Its made me more cynical, more bitter, more jaded.
Well it's tough to get a good read but I think if I brought him a chair, he'd sit.
...he embibed her glistening spell...just before the other shoe...fell.
(Aggravated) Well, I got screwed on the donuts. There were none left. Heh!
No, no, I mean, driving Susan to lesbianism.
Yes, I agree. I hope my parents go long before I do.
Yeah. (Jerry nodding) ... Oh, you think because of what I said about the manure. I wa, wa, was just saying how it takes a negative thing, and puts it on a positive spin on it.
Hes a cube. Anyway, he got married six months ago. He told me ever since hes been wearing a wedding band, women have been coming on to him everywhere he goes.
You cant be serious. This is New York city. There must be eleven million decent hotel rooms! Whatta you need? A flag? (waving his handkerchief) This is the signal, Jerry, this is the signal!
You just checked your watch. Are you thinking of bailing on him?
I cant do it. Ill, Ill keep her busy.
Brother Costanza will be taking the vow of silence.
OK Look, the gum isn't cutting it for me. We need to be about something else...anything..please.
(angry that she believes Al was right) No he's not right. Al Netchie is not right! Alright I'm canceling the father-son picnic. I don't know what he's gonna do with all that potato salad.
Oh yeah.. (Starts to open it) Sally called Susan - said you guys really hit it off.
Here. (panicky) We'll leave it here for you!
Kramer, what's the name of the store with the mannequin?
Aw, Mr. Kruger, Sir. Merry Christmas! (Hands him a card)
(shouting) How d'you not like Soda?! It's bubbly, it's refreshing!
Are you going to help me or not?
Do you ever just get down on your knees and thank god that you know me and have access to my dementia?
Well, actually you did miss one nugget of entertainment. (Pause) Have you ever seen Elaine dance?
That's it. This is it. I'm done. Through. It's over. I'm gone. Finished. Over. I will never work for you again. Look at you. (laughing) You think you're an important man? Is that what you think? You are a laughingstock. You are a joke. These people are laughing at you. You're nothing! You have no brains, no ability, nothing! (knocking object over on desk) I quit!
Boy, she is nice. I like her, I like her Jerry. She's got substance. She oozes substance.
'The lights are much brighter there. You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares, just go...'
(Laughs) Relationship intern...hey, what if two of us teamed up?
All right. Shh! I gotta focus. I'm shifting into soup mode.
Well, I told it to Susan before, and she didn't like it.
Out of the question. Out of the question!
uh, Uh, Vandelay Industries, is uh. 129 West 81st street. It's a very small industry Vandelay. It's one of the reasons I wanted to uh, work for them.
See now that bothers me even more than dying bothers me, cause it's people like you who live to be a hundred and twenty because you're not bothered by it. How could it not bother you?
Hey, I work for Kruger Industrial Smoothing "We don't care, and it shows."
He just walked away! And once again I'm standing here like a little man. Well not this time! (George leaves the store and follows the dog owner) You! Dog man!
When is it going to be my turn, Jerry? When do I get my 15 minutes? I want my 15 minutes!
(Showing Jerry up) Listen carefully. My mother has never laughed. Ever. Not a giggle, not a chuckle, not a tee-hee.. never went 'Ha!'
. . . I'm a little scared of her.
Well I was lost, I never saw the first one. By the way, you mind if I watch it here?
Never mind. The're done. All I have to do now is redo them. You know if you take everything I've ever done in my entire life and condense it down into one day, it looks decent.
For that rent, shed take a bath in the toilet tank if she had to.
(examining reflection) I really think this looks pretty good.
Which market, the, eh, big one, the big market, the big board. Bull market, bear market, you name the market, I'm there.
Wait wait wait, what is she... (takes the milk can from Jerry and puts it on the table) What is she like?
This is a huge project involving lots of numbers and papers and folders.
I've seen squeeze mustard. I've never seen squeeze ketchup.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. But then, I said to him, 'Oh yeah? Well, the jerk store called, and they're running outta you.'
Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot. I'll pay you back.
Rudy?! That skunk, I knew he didn't burn those clothes.
All right. You wanna know what one of her favorite expressions is? Happy, Pappy?
You remember the woman on the horse? She wanted my spot.
Now if I wanna see anything I gotta wear these.
Alright, alright! We'll buy her a wheelchair! Wheelchairs, engagement presents.. IT NEVER ENDS!
One of your guys - Kip, or Ned, short name - stole my Twix candy bar!
You see, you see? I see things as they are and I say, 'no!' Uh, wait, you see things as they are not and you s- Wait, uh, you see things, do you see things as they are? What do you say when you see things?
Well I don't want to get into a big dispute about the pants.
You've still got pretty good coverage. Once the enemy advances beyond this perimeter - (points at Kurt's head with a pen) - then you won't be Kurt anymore.
No. I wouldnt even have to tell her. I could surprise her.
Uh, I'm just selling some of Dad's things, (looking into Kramer's eyes) that's what he would have wanted.
Oh, no, no. Twix is the only candy with the cookie crunch.
Dad, it's me. Hey, listen, I was at Fortunoff's the other day, and, you know what, you were right.
It was a good idea. Susan liked it. Now, if he hadn't vomitted all over her, we'd be writing it right now.
( to Jerry) What about the letter, should I think about the letter?
(dials) Hi, are you OK? no, no,.. huh, (hangs up) She hung up.
Alright. I'll run it by a few people.
A garden! I cant believe theres a garden!
Because the underwear is pulled up from the back and ... it wedges in..
Great! Great! I actually just had two meaningful intelligent conversations with Corbin Bernsen and George Wendt.
Hey, hey, hey! You don't call me back?!
Hey, don't embarrass me today. I got some friends in the stands. (George makes a swinging motion with an imaginary bat and pulls something in his back.)
Who doesn't like cashmere? Find me one person in the world that doesn't like cashmere. It's too expensive.
(to a street vender selling hot dogs) You must hate hot dogs, huh? Or else, you, uh, you really like 'em and that's why you, you do this.
(back-pedalling) No, he, he didnt actually tell me that, uh, we were talking about that commercial  in fact I think I brought it up because I like that commercial. No, he, he would never tell me anything. He never discusses anything. Hes, hes like a clam. Youre not gonna mention this, to him...
You can go crazy trying to figure that place out.
Youre a fine person. Youre a humanitarian. Shes very sexy.
You know, you're going along, you think everything's all right and all of a sudden you get that tap. (George taps his own shoulder). You know it's like pfffff (whistling sound), all right that's enough, you're through.
(realizing he was short changed) I was in the pool! I was in the pool!
Get going? But we haven't really, you know....
So, anyway, what's uh, what's the status with, uh...
All right Bubble Boy. Let's just play... Who invaded Spain in the 8th century?
No, it's doing the same thing to someone that they did to you.
Yes, yes, she had a nose job. I loved her very deeply. Will she ever speak to me again?
How come this sweater is only 85 dollars?
Well anyway, the, uh... the stone is up, I paid my respects, guess that's it.
I know it may sound shocking. But, I just can't stop myself from... wanting you.
Why couldn't you squeeze one of those stupid rubber balls to get your stress out? Why did you have to destroy *twenty-five* computers?
One... (Glenda seeing George is serious; gets up and leaves)
We're gonna hang around here a little while....something funny going on here
But you didn't use a coaster, Jerry, you left a stain! (he runs to kitchen)
There's elevators all over! It all looks the same.
Well, anyway, the book club meets tomorrow, Mr. Temple.
Why is nice bad? What kind a of sick society we are living in, when nice is bad?
So you're buying the car back for your parents?
Well you know what I've discovered Mrs. Sokol. It's not so much the looking as the listening. I listen for work. And as I'm looking and listening I am also looking. You can't discount looking. It's sort of a combination. It's looking, and listening, listening and looking. But you must look.
What are you gonna do with all of them?
(Defensively) He knows how to read. And he also knows finishing an entire book doesn't prove anything. And get this he's into architecture.
Now Im in the worst position of all.
No. This is not cotton. Here, lemme see. (Tries to look at the tag on the uniform. Tartabull gets creeped out and resists.) Will you stop it? (Looks at the tag.) Oh. Of course. Polyester!
She says she has to come to New York on business...
(Concerned) Why're you doing this, Jerry? Is it your career? Things will pick up.
So in order to use these, I gotta spend like fifteen-hundred bucks. This is a bill for fifteen-hundred dollars. Plus, she'd ask about the sleeping arrangements, that whole sleeping arrangement conversation is depressing.
I know, they're out of their minds! It's fantastic!
No, no, she might just think its a gift.
No... (takes off his glasses and wipes his eyes with his sleeve)
They'll make you a Big Salad. What do you think, they're the only one's that make a Big Salad?
Yeah, you know, what'd she uh, look like?
Like if she wants to know if I'm pleased with something, she'll say, "Happy, Pappy?"
And then, then, then she leaves with somebody else! Never even, never even said goodbye! Never called me back.. Never apologized. Nothing. Like I was dirt.
She made a big breakfast every Sunday. I don't know what she put in those eggs.
I hope so. I can't take him living with me much longer. He makes this kasha, it stinks up the whole house.
I'm not through here, Jerry. (Picks up the model of the conference room.) I'm gonna keep on investigating. This thing is like an onion. The more layers you peel, the more it stinks. (Pam enters, George leaves.)
I was trying to loosen 'em up a little bit.
Um, hi, its George, George Costanza, remember me? The guy that didnt come up for coffee. You see, I didnt realise that coffee didnt really mean... well, whatever. Anyway, it was fun. It was... it was fun, so... oh boy, um, so... You call me back. If you want. Its up to you, you know, whatever you wanna do. Either way. The balls in your court. So uh, take it easy.
She stole twenty dollars from me. (getting angry) Yeah, I might've gotten it back, but Lloyd Braun interfered!
Well, I can't walk anywhere now. I'm just gonna be wishing there were walkways. (seeing Elaine removing her shoe) What are you doing?
Whoa, whoa, you're not getting in my car with gummy shoes.
Aw, I've just got to say it once, everybody else gets to say it, why can't I say it?
Hate those couples. I could never bee one of those couples. There are no bald woman around. You know?
Who am I going to meet who is better than her? No one, Jerry. No one's better than her.
And then I hear this rabbi on television, I mean imagine.
I didn't shave this morning. I don't feel like myself.
Speak now, or we are headed to the Hamptons. It's a two-hour drive. Once you get in that car, we are going all the way... to the Hamptons. All right, you wanna get nuts? Come on. Let's get nuts!
Oh, no. No no no no no. Id have to advise against that. What, do you know this woman a month? Lets see, youre going to be with her seventy-two hours. Thats a dating decathlon.
Love to! (Cracks his knuckles, then winces under the pain)
You know, we could go uptown, and that way we could give Jerry a ride home.
She invited me up. Coffees not coffee, coffee is sex.
I got to tell you I felt terrible. I really thought she was going to collapse and kill herself.
Wait a minute, that is my apartment. I earned it with 34 years of misery!
Yeah, I may move out there. (getting 'yeah, right' glances from the Rosses) I mean it, I'll do it! OK, I'll see ya later. Keep it real!
And, Ill have a club soda with no ice.
(pause) Alright if you think it's too much they don't have to mail the postcards.
I am such a Huge whale fan. These marine biologists were showin' how they communicate with each other with these squeaks and squeals, what a fish!
Oh, you know what you're like? You're like a pathetic gambler. You're one of those losers in Las Vegas who keeps thinking he's gonna come up with a way to win at blackjack.
Yeah,yeah!! I'll pick you up right now.....All right All right....Hey! gotta go.
Now, I'm aware that my own physical dimensions are perhaps a little short of perfection.
So I spoke a little to your little friend Denise last night.
Madam? What are you calling me madam for?
I have to talk to you about something .
No, no, this wasn't moving on. I got the hook. I wish I could get a lesson in that.
I'm, uh, George Costanza. I was having dinner with your son.
Let Maria Shriver give her a baby shower.
Whatcha got there, the 4-volt? Heh, I did you a favor.
Oh of course you can use it, sure. (Jerry saying stuff through the phone) Ok, bye. (hangs the phone up)
(turning to each other) I dont know. Hes an importer.
I, I think I made my point. I'm sorry if I was a little harsh.
Oh no no no, if you must know, I would rather be with her than go to the game.
It's cleavage. I couldn't look away. What am I, waiting to win an Oscar here? This is all I have in my life.
We have no need to speak. We communicate with deep soulful looks.
Oh I'm going baby! I'm going! (he leaves)
Oh. It's just horse manure (huh huh - laughs, he points back at the horse that walked by) Horse manure's not that bad. I don't even mind the word manure. You know, it's, it's nure, which is good. and a ma in front of it. MA-NURE. I mean when you consider the other choices, manure is actually pretty refreshing.
(on an imaginary microphone) Uh, no, not at this time.
It was on a magazine! And it still had the doily on.
People can drop change down here, Jerry. And theyre too lazy to pick it up.
...meet the Mets. Come on in and greet the Mets.
This is a fantastic place! I always thought it was a meat packing plant!
Between the car getting totalled, the towing charge and the fine, there's no way I can ever pay him back...
(talking to nobody) I like horses. Maybe I could be a stable boy.
Will I call you when I get home? ha ha What do you think? ee, you kill me kill me
But I asked you before if you had a ticket, and you said no!
Would you excuse us for a minute Tim boy, we're kind of in the middle of something.
I don't. Susan wants to have it out when Sally comes tomorrow.
(sitting) So, guess where Mr 'Ocean phoned' turned up? He's working for Firestone, in Akron, Ohio.
You're gonna rip it. You're gonna rip it.
No No I'm working on a system...Who was that?
I am never saying 'I love you' again unless they say it first.
Were aware of the proximity to the park, yes.
Alright, but no later, because my parents are coming back.
Right.. the sign. (Hesitates, then makes a series of stupid gestures)
(to Mickey) Can't you just switch with another Midget?
Oh, this is unbelievable. I'm stuck. Every time I think I'm out, they pull me back in.
It's standard. Has she left you one of those messages where she uses up the whole machine?
No! No! Turn it off! No feats of strength! (Gets up and starts running out of the coffee shop) I hate Festivus!
rush? you want a rush? drop a ball on your toe my friend, talk about a rush, you'll be throbbing, you'll see visions
Ok, fine. It's going to be very interesting, very interesting if they don't show up tonight. You know my mother made all this Paella.
Bender? He cant play left. He stinks. I just dont see what purpose is it gonna serve your going? I mean, you think dead peole care whos at their funeral? They dont even know theyre having a funeral. Its not like shes hanging out in the back going, I cant believe Jerry didnt show up.
Its a Twix! Theyre all Twix! It was a setup! A setup, I tell ya! And youve robbed it! Youve all screwed me again! Now, gimme one! Gimme a Twix!
Listen. Let me ask you something. If you and Mona were ever to... dance, how do you decide who leads? I mean... do you take turns? Do you discuss it beforehand? How does that work?
Yeah, yeah. You must have squirted a piece of pulp in it too.
Quick. Get this thing back in the pizzeria
She told this couple she had an affair with a matador.
Well...I was in the locker room showering, and I...I had to go, so...
Well, I'm the boyfriend. Otherwise, what's the point of being the boyfriend? This is where you have to be when you're the boyfriend.
(Laughs) You, I guess, you don't remember me.. but we actually, kind of um.. went out.. a couple of years ago.. once.. remember?
Look it's no secret what's going on between us. (to Jerry) She doesn't like me. Now Jerry if you don't mind.
I am. The folks are twelve hundred miles away. (gleeful) I'm basking in the buffer zone. (looks for the waitress) 'Nother piece of pie here!
(Embarrassed) That's all I could find. (A moment passes) Would you mind getting the door?
Oh. Oh. Yeah, sure. Here. Uh, sit down. Uh, uh, cheese, there? (he grabs a suit jacket from the desk chair and puts it on)
(Laughs slightly) A physician married to a salesman. (Chuckles) Well, I gotta tell you, Beth, you coulda done a lot better than him.
Yeah, there was a fire in my apartment.
How can I do this? How can I move back in with those people? Please, tell me. They're insane. You know that.
In the whole world right now, there's maybe three emergencies. Why would you think, on this entire planet, that you're one of those three?
Well, as I say, the pink-eye made my vision...quite blurry... (Joe's daughter comes to the door.)
You know what? I should really go talk to her. Nothing confrontational. Just two adults sitting down trying to clear the air. You know, I just know if I could spend some time alone with her. I've got to. (he grabs his jacket) I've got to.
Because ballpark food doesn't count as real food.
What about the skin? I need a good cheek, I like a good cheek.
Jerry, for all I know this guy went out of his way to not invite you. How am I gonna feel if I show up with an uninvited, unwelcome intruder?
Besides, Steven Koren has the highest of aspirations. He wants to be (pauses for effect) an architect.
Wait till you hear this! (George sees Donna and no Jerry.) Whoa, ah, Im sorry, I didnt, I had no idea.
A-and don't settle for 145, you can do better, you're a genius. Heheheh (laughs)
(upset) Could you put a little thought into this? Jerry's gone, you could humour me. He humours me.
What kind of a sick impulse does that??
(TALKING IN PASSENGER WINDOW) I didn't mean anything by it. I don't even know L. Ron Hubbard! I didn't know you were...
If you had like five chickens could you tell them apart by just the way they acted? Or would they all just be walking around? Bak, bak, baak, bak? Cause if they have individual personalities Im not sure we should be eaten `em. What's the matter with you?
. All right , just give me my car and let me get the hell out of here.
(from bathroom) VANDELAY, SAY VANDEL... (George falls) ... Vandelay Industries, ...
Just as she was. Hey, Mario! Remember us?
Kramer, this is perfect. I need you to go in there, pretend you're a doctor and check this guy for moles.
Aaaa (looking around for Jerry) aaaa (finds Jerry) Ah ha. They had plans huh? They were busy. They were busy with their (doing a little dance to make the plans seem all that important) big plans!
(offers his) Oh, you want to taste mine.
And you know what else I've decided to do? I'm going to keep seeing the bald woman.
I don't know. I do know that I have some kind of a talent - something to offer. I just don't know what it is yet!
Yeah, when the season starts. Right now, I sit around pretending that I'm busy.
Ah, alright. Believe me, that kid's gonna be called Soda.
What big salad? I'm going to the coffee shop.
It's not really a mental institution. It's more like a depression clinic. She went out to Woodhaven and checked herself in. I'm, I'm sick over this.
Have you ever given your code to anyone?
Anyway there was all this tension. I asked her if she wanted to go out to dinner and she said "no, maybe we could get together for lunch." You know what that means.
Yeah, I'll zip in, "How do you do?", zip out. She'll love me.
No..hummm, What do you know about what you look like.
It's just a magnificent stone. (turns to Jerry) Jerry?
This hat just bottles in the heat, I -I don't even need a coat! It's unbelievable!
(To Estelle) Scissor. (She gets the scissors from the coffee table and hands them to George with the point facing him) Don't hand them to me with the point facing out!
(George is telling a story. Karen is laughing and she seems to be the only one to find him funny) So I go into this clothing store and the saleswoman is wearing this (whistling) low cut thing. So I said to her "Can I ask you a question? When you put on a top like that, what's your tought process? What's going on in your mind?"
Could we talk about this some other time?
'Scarsdale surprise'. That's the musical about that Scarsdale diet doctor murder.
What if her experience with me *drove* her to it?
Ah, excuse me, Vice-president Coco, no one cares about your Gammy.
I dont think theres ever been an appointment in my life where I wanted the other guy to show up. (George notices an elderly man in a leather chair.) Wait a second, is that him?
I, I couldn't help but notice that uh you don't have a chair.
One little wink. She'll freak out, tell my parents. They'll be all over me. Who is this guy?
Ha ha ha ha, oh all right, go ahead, deride, deride if you must. But let me tell you something, with my personality and this set of hair, you know what I am now? I am in the game. I no longer defer to the coifed. I'm a player.
Why do you have to be so suspicious of every one. This is a great man Zeng Zau, he wants to help bald people.
Hey, at least I was a camp waiter.
I know. I cut the button off and poked a hole with a letter opener.
I'm grotesque . I look like a troll.
I'm not paying for this. If you were going out with her, it'd be a different story.
So, he made an appointment for me to see Dinkins' doctor. He's just trying to humiliate me.
So what? Ill start talking to him, you know, casual, and Ill work my way around to it.
Yeah. I got 'em down to fifty bucks. I just have to do all the jackhammering myself.
She calls you today and she doesnt make a plan for tomorrow? What is that? Its Saturday night!
What is that, Boyfriend? I don't understand that. What, what does she think I asked her out for?
Hey! Wow, the K-Man! (They walk into the kitchen inside)
I still don't see why you wouldn't eat me. I'm your best friend.
(clears his throat) Im, uh, Im an architect.
Oh come on? No come on. She took off her hat and there she was (waving his hand over his head) hello. It was like I was looking at myself in the mirror.
Me? No, no, I don't, I don't. Doing very well, very well, yep.
Is she the only girl in the whole world? Why can't you get find your own girl?
I still don't understand this. Abby has a mentor?
Alright, well you know what'cha gotta do, you gotta go through her purse. Y'know, the-the credit cards, driver's license...
Are, are you sure this is decaf? Wheres the orange indicator?
Tuesday? I can't do it Tuesday. Steinbrenner needs me to run---
Well at least you and I are talking about how there's nothing to talk about.
I'm George.. George Costanza.. I've never been in the hospital a day in my life.. except when I had my tonsils out. You know, they never gave me any ice cream. I always felt that-
This MacKenzie, he's a bit of a nut. Someone told me he fired the last guy because his nose whistled when he breathed.
Yeah, but get this, the message said 'call me if you have the time'. Heh heh if I have the time, you get it?
Yeah, what do you do when you run out of laundry?
I think I was affected by the caffeine.
That condom killed me. Why do they have to make the wrappers on those things so hard to open?
Nothing, I... said it was a little problem.
No they don't. I tried that once. I snubbed for a year. Nothing. Every woman I saw, I snubbed. You never saw people so pleased. (Elaine returns from the bathroom.)
I love it! This is fantastic! Look at this couch, is this velvet?!
Maybe I'll go down to the track. Put it all on a horse...
I got two tickets to see "Guys And Dolls".
I offered to pay. She should've said no.
I mean, we're not stupid, right? We know when something's funny!
(annoyed) Not a peep. They just cleaned the carpets and left. Call themselves a cult!
And I have to go. If I don't go, he'll know I'm lying.
(improvising) My uh uncle is having an operation. I just wanted to see how he was.
Not necessarily. Mustard lends itself to the squeeze.
You don't? Boy, I think about it a lot. I think about it at my age. Imagine how much I'll be thinkin' about it at your age. All I'll do is keep thinkin' about it until it drives me insane...
You met her a few weeks ago, but...?
Assistant to the General Manager!! Do you know what means?!? He'd could be askin' my advice on trades! Trades, Jerry, I'm a heartbeat away!
I'm unbelievable at spelling last names. Give me a last name.
You just gave them to him two days ago, he's gotta give you a grace period.
Robin, listen to me. The most amazing thing has happened. Kramer has opened my eyes. I think I've changed.
Is it flowing? I like flowing, cascading hair. Thick lustrous hair is very important to me.
(con't) A-Anyway, I was thinking we would take two cars up to the cabin and that way if one of wanted to stay you know...
Plans. Schemes. She ah, she keeps talking about getting back together with her old friends, you know - "the gang," as she likes to call them (chuckles), you know. Yeah, they're eh, they're hatching something, you can count on that.
Oh, nothing much. You know, I went over to Jerry's. Talked to Jerry. Um, could I talk to you for a minute?
(sensing his chance) Well, they do now. Neighborhood's changing.
I'm very nervous about this. I've never spoken to a mental patient before.
I don't think we should. We really don't know each other very well.
He's the guy we're the buying the chair for, remember? It was your suggestion.
Yeah, my wife couldnt make it today. Shes got something with her mother... Who knows whats going on with her. Dont let any one kid you, its tough.
All right, Kramer that's it.....( pushes the camera) Hello . English. Does anyone speak English
Well, I'm doing it, Jerry. I'm buying the Frogger machine. Now the torch will burn forever.
Is that what's hurting your appreciation for the story?
I've done the march in. Best feeling in the world.
Honesty, hard-work, these are the values that I was raised on. The most important thing Joey, is to be able to look yourself in the mirror before you go to sleep at night.
You don't listen when people talk to you anymore!
I didn't know you were such a Bette Midler fan.
I went to look in the mirror, it wasn't there. You threw off my equilibrium.
Hmm, what's he doin' in the city today?
Yes. I like to feel cozy. I have a very small apartment. I like to feel tucked in, nestled in. Love to be nestled.
We had an incredible phone conversation. We talked for like twenty minutes. I threw away my notes in the middle of the call. You know, I thought she had a great voice timbre. Is it timbre or tamber?
Actually, (George flips the book back to the beginning) I'll take these nice glossy ones.
Can you believe he sold his glasses on the street?
They should call it round tine. You know what I'm talking about.
Na no, I'm not good in these situations. I can't hide my pity. I..I make em feel worse.
Actually I think I'm gonna take a few days off (starts to leave)
I don't know what Newman wanted to see me for.
Alright I happen to know what they did last night, they had dinner with Kramer.
Wha? Did you use those? These are guest soaps! (he grabs the soaps and begins examining them for damage)
Yeah, now I gotcha! (hangs up the phone and rushes out the door)
Yeah. I think we really go something here.
All right, I'm gonna find a guy with a truck. GLC must live on!
No, that's my only suit. It cost me 350 dollars. I got it at Moe Ginsburg.
(Elaine walking down the hall they notice her and wave her into the room) Elaine! Get! (She enters)
I-I don't know. Last time I got the tap.
Had to come in and maybe well get together? Had to and maybe?
I knew it!! (shuts cab door) I predicted it! (hits cab roof twice, it drives off) Saw both of them today! What a disaster! I'm runnin' all over Queens. First I saw my mother. We had lunch together. Never had... LUNCH with my mother before--it's like a date! Then we drive down to Kew Gardens! Tons of traffic! I see my father. We played "Clue"! All day with this! [Kew Gardens (see links at end of script)]
Yeah, yeah, not fan talk, not gushing, you know? Actual conversation, I was incredibly articulate!
Jerry? I have to tell you something. This is the dullest moment Ive ever experienced.
Wait, wait, did you ever see him throw up?!
(frustrated) Ohh, I wanted to see that. (waves his arms in frustration) Thanks. Thanks a lot.
He's older, completely covered in filth, no whistle, but I think it's him.
(embarrassed with a touch of unrestrained jubilation) Yes.
Then of course with evolution, the octopus lost the nostrils and took on the more familiar look that we know today.
(sitting) Newww tuxedo. For the Pinstripe Ball. Steinbrenner is throwing a huge party at Tavern on the Green, heh!
Or maybe, she just wanted to go to the Tony's. I tell you what; you ask her out again. No Tony, just Jerry. That way you know it he was her dude or just some dude.
Hey, maybe I could bribe one of those women that hand out the towels in the powder room.
Ah. You know, there's gotta be an easier way to open ketchups. They should make it in a tube.
Kramer! You can't go! Who's gonna do the feats of strength?
She's got everything, right? (counts on his fingers) She's intelligent, she's smart, she's got a great sense of humour.
What's so hard about that? How am I supposed to get it in there? I can't just walk in with it. I have to get the Rosses out of the apartment!
No, no no it's not about postponing. I just think the first day of Spring is the perfect day to get married. You know, Spring! Rejuvenation! Rebirth! Everything is blooming all the
I-I don't get these birds! They're breaking the deal. It-it's like the pigeons decided to ignore me!
I don't know. This sandwich is making me flush.
I mean, she's beautiful, right? She's just my type. The dark hair, the full lips.
And, it is all because of that car
"Yeah,yeah yeah yeah! I've seen these.....they sorta ..they make your legs..stronger."
(eating a pickle) Well they're his tickets, he can do what he wants with them.
It wasn't down in, it was sort of on top.
No, no, Hey I'll get it. What's in the BIG salad?
(Standing in the doorway) I'm fine with it! Fi-hi-hi-hine I say! (Leaves)
You, uh, you like baseball? [picks up baseball from desk]
(after waitress walks away) I don't believe it, she did it again!
Didn't say anything. (They go into Elaine's apartment.)
'Kay. I'll uh, I'll see you later. Anybody want some tomatoes?
It's Allison. I dated her right after you. She's obsessed with me.
Did you explain to her about the good naked and the bad naked?
And she'll still see it, you're not stopping her from seeing it.
I'm not paying $500 for this! It's a piece of junk!
Oh you can stuff your sorries in a sack, Mister!
Seemingly. Seemingly. But within that basic framework there are many subtle variations, only discernable to an acute observer, that reflect the many moods, the many shades, the many sides of George Costanza.
Aw, hoh, oh Deena, thank God. (he hugs Deena) Thank God you're here. Listen, you gotta help me. You gotta tell these people that I'm okay. You know that I don't belong in here.
(to the woman) Boy, I have to get to a bathroom.
Okay. Uh, my mother is is going to pay for the sessions. ... Oh,Elaine?
Well I'm sure you have secrets from me. I don't know anything about your cycles.
Pardon me, I went to see your friend Dwayne... there was no discount.
yeah, Kramer, we're, uh, kind of in the middle of something here. We're trying to do a little work..
You want me to ask one of the Yankees.
Yeah, and now someone's going to be taking messages for me.
...and, and maybe shell see me when she gets there, does this woman intend to spend time with me?
You know, my mother used to walk around on our apartment just in her bra and panties. She didn't look anything like you, she was really disgusting, really bad body. If you could imagine uglier and fatter version of Shirley Booth. Remember Shirley Booth from Hazel. Really embarrassing, cause you know I had only mother in the whole neighborhood who was worse looking than Hazel. Imagine the taunts I would hear.
I believe you cut me off, and then made an obscene gesture.
It's impossible. I got him a wake up service.
Oh, yeah, sure, laugh it up. Everybody else did!
I can't believe it. He's going! He's fired!
Um, I don't uh, really think I can go.
Oh, I find you so charming. You wuss.
" I'll always be a winner and you'll always be a loser." This is what he said to me.
Well, Im going with him. Id like to... Ive never done a solid before.
(through mouthful of food) So, Carrie, you and Susan are cousins. So your baby daughter is gonna be Susan's second cousin, right? So what does that make me?
I--I've been, walkin' around all night.. I've been thinkin' about Allison and me.. an' you--
Oh, I had it perfectly timed out the Grand Central, the Van Wyck! You destroyed my whole timing!
If there's any doubt, I do a leave-behind. Keys, gloves, scarf -- I go back to her place to pick it up...(pop sound) date number two.
(aggravated) Oh, that's not good enough! You don't try and de-sour. You have to sweeten too!
Why didn't you just wear a heavier coat?
All right. I will see you boys later.
Yeah, yeah. He went into the bedroom and started sobbing.
Those were her exact words, I like George.
You know, I could have actually gone to that.
You fixed me up with a bald woman.
Hi! Mr. West, this is my friend Elaine--
Yes! Yes. You know. She didn't know about Pasteurization. He didn't know anout Fumigation. But they made it work!
Oh, there's a soup stand, Kramer's been going there.
Id like a doggie bag for this please. (hands her plate to the waitress)
(George takes out the suit from the other rack) Well, look at this. (innocently) This doesn't belong here! Someone has made a terrible mistake.
Oh, this guy tried to sneak into my space.
No no no no, you have to approach this as if he was a woman.
Well ...... but how do I get someone else fired?
Yeah, two for the 715 of Novaj pravas (?). What you're wearing the green sweater?
(opening door) It's a big night. I'm, uh, ice skating with one, and going to a staged reading of "Godspell" with the other.
She's stickin' it to me that she makes more money than me.
Ah! Health's not good enough. I want more than health. Health's not doing it for me anymore. I'm sick of health.
Because of me? You must be joking! Who wouldn't want to live because of me? I'm nothing!
Yes. With a little guidance, Steven Koren is going to be everything I claim to be, only for real. That's my dream, Jerry.
Yeah, hold on. I'm, uh, I'm just trying to get a reading on my dashboard compass. Where are my parents?
[to himself] Argh! [to Susan] Susan! Hi! Oh, boy! What are you doing here?!
Lemme see this. (Tries to grab the papers.)
What did I get the veggie burger for? You got a veggie burger, so I had to get the veggie burger, I'm allover crums...
He might as well have! I caught him, and his face was covered in chocolate and cookie crumbs.
[whispering] Elaine? [loud whisper] Elaine! [louder whisper] Elaine!
Well, anything I can do to help, um...she's a wonderful girl. Very smart. Very eh...crafty.
Dad, you know what it takes to compete with Microsoft and IBM?
I had to give it to the liquor store guy.
UH, ha ha, ... It's just SO frustrating. It's a brand new jacket.
Puddys just gonna give you the car, huh? (Skeptically) Youll see. First they stick you with the undercoating, rust-proofing, dealer prep. Suddenly, youre on your back like a turtle.
Well it's a little strange. You going to start to talk like Elaine from now on?
You think you could hook me up with these guys?
Handicap? (gesturing to his cane) Oh, I'm not handicapped.
She knows that I have her clock. I know that she has my hat. I think she's getting ready to make an exchange.
Pick up the phone, Elaine. Pick it up!
Hey hey hey, we're in a rush here.
all right! rock-climbing! J..just the 2 of us? alright! hey I'll make some sandwiches, what what do you like? tuna? peanut butter?
I find the soothing pastorial images very conduc-
Oh no! Im vigilant. Theyll never get me out. Im like a weed, Jerry.
Well, you know, book reports. That kind of stuff.
And Ill tell you something else, Im not even going to ask you. I want to know. But Im not gonna ask. Youll tell me when you feel comfortable. So what was it? Four hundred? Five hundred? Did you pay five hundred for this? (Jerry coyly ignores Georges questions, while George grows increasingly serious.) Over six? Cant be seven. Dont tell me you paid seven hundred dollars for this jacket! Did you pay seven hundred dollars for this jacket? Is that what youre saying to me? You are sick! Is that what you paid for this jacket? Over seven hundred? What did you pay for this jacket?! I wont say anything. I wanna know what you paid for this jacket! Oh my God! A thousand dollars?! You paid a thousand dollars for this jacket?! All right, fine. (George heads for the door.) Im walking outta here right now thinking you paid a thousand dollars for this jacket, unless you tell me different. (Jerry remains silent.) Oh, ho! All right! Ill tell you what, if you dont say anything in the next five seconds, Ill know it was over a thousand.
Fine. Steal the battery. Now, all right, here is the Frogger. This is the front door, and this is the outlet.
No, I'm fine. I'm good. I'm very good.
He asked me to keep it a secret.
Thank you Mr.Farkus, thank you very much indeed sir.
Well then, from out of nowhere, a huge tidal wave lifted me, tossed like a cork and I found myself right on top of him, (ELAINE gasps quietly Ahhhh) face to face with the blow-hole. I-I, I could barely see from the waves crashing down upon me but, I knew something was there so I reached my hand in, felt around and pulled out the obstruction!
Ahh! (closes his eyes and rolling his head back) Umh!
So, they go off for the ride, by the time they come back the bread is there.
I don't want Morgan's job. He's got a lot of work to do. Hey, Elaine, your friend never woke up Mr. Morgan.
(pulling out some money) Uh, yeah. Hang on. Just... yeah.
Ow! .. Ow! I give, I give! Uncle!
Why does she want you to be mad?
They would never tell me, Elaine. First of all, they probably think that I killed Susan. Besides, I don't even think they like me. (Jerry comes over to the table.)
I think I had some hard candy in there.
Yes! 860,000. I can't believe it's still standing. No one has beaten me in like 10 years.
You be nice! He's giving me a parking space (echoes) parking space... parking space...
Well she apologized, and then she wanted to know if we could get together Wednesday afternoon.
Five-thousand? Why would anybody buy Kramer for $5000? (laughs)
Elaine, can I just explain something to you very privately here? Susan and I have been together many, many times now, and just between you and me, there's really no big surprises here, so...make-up sex is all that I have left.
Yeah. What are you doing with the Daily Worker?
I think hitting a defenseless child is my business.
I know but I couldn't think of anything else to say to her.
Baah! There it is! You just said it! That's what I want! Now say it again, and tell it to me.
Okay, look, Audrey, before you take the bandage off just remember that I was the one that encouraged you to do this, you know? Now that you're gonna be a great beauty, let's not forget how this all began. You know, like if you'd listened to your friend, Elaine,
Allison! Hi! Oh, my God! How are you?
Ho, ha, ho! Jerry Seinfeld's a funny guy!
Yeah, much better. All right, so what's the move, because I need *something*. This woman I'm dating, it's like she's doing her nails during love-making.
Of course hes been in touch with him. Hes left two messages. He just hasnt heard back yet, thats all.
I'm not stealing it. They owe me ten dollars. They stole from me.
Why not? It's a good look for a woman.
Christie? That's the one you met in the antique store?
Oh, it's a bad day. Uh, you got everyone in your house, you're thinkin', "These are my friends?!"
Its been a long night. You go home and get some sleep.
If she want's to continue to have a fibre of her being she'll be very careful (hitting each other)
Ok uh, I guess I'll tell them that.
I can tell you this. If I am not in front of my house at six-fifteen, when my parents get there, they will put me on an aggravation installment plan that will compound with interest for decades.
Huh. (Makes a "over his head" gesture with his arm) C'mon, let's go, go. We got a lot of work to do today.
Yep. And it didn't take very long either.
Uh, excuse me, uh, um, Jason. I don't want to get into a big thing here, but... I'm not sure if, technically, what you just said was actually an apology.
Since when is Elaine's boyfriend selling cars? I thought he was a mechanic.
Because you're a gymnastics teacher. It's only natural.
Oh, don't look. T-This is the part where they change me.
I like to stop at the duty free shop!
No, I would have picked up on it. I can always tell when a woman likes me, they always somehow let you know. With me, they could torture me, I wouldn't tell them. If anything I'd try to make them think I don't like them, then they think, "Oh, look at this guy, he's not even looking at me, he must have something going for him."
You can stuff your sorries in a sack, mister!
Yeah!, a doodle of me...look at the size of the nose , the ears, all my features are distorted.
I got to get downtown and buy that suit. The store opens in twenty minutes.
I gotta go zoo. I feel like I could set more of my own schedule.
Going to need a little more coffee here.
All you got is instant coffee? Why don't you get some real coffee?
Yes, flowers. I will get her flowers, I will go to the florist!
Where's the luck? There's no luck. 1,900 dollars down the drain.
You took me to one of your shows..
..And I went down there one time to see...
Oh, Rita. Hey, Mr. Shermack, how're you doing, good to see you. Jay, always a pleasure. (To Susan) Sweetie. (Kisses her and then sits down next to Jerry) Yeah, yeah, that butler idea, that's beautiful. Isn't that killer? (Aside to Jerry) I thought I was getting the butler.
Yes! Yes! Everybody has to like me. I must be liked!
(Hands Antonio a card) Here's my card. I'm in real estate, so, if you're ever looking for something bigger, something nicer.. (Antonio is staring at him, angered) ..maybe not right now. Anyway.. (Extends his hand for a handshake. Antonio doesn't move)
I don't know, honey. What do you want to get? [in babying voice] I want you to get anything you want...'cause I love you so much. I want you to be happy. Okay, sweetie?
Hey, when you order from the waitress, get her to point to the menu. I want to see what finger she uses.
Who would Want to. She tried to end it with me, Jerry.
Ah you have no idea of the magnitude of this thing. If she is allowed to infiltrate this world, then George Costanza as you know him, Ceases to Exist! You see, right now, I have Relationship George, but there is also Independent George. That's the George you know, the George you grew up with -- Movie George, Coffee shop George, Liar George, Bawdy George.
You're not going to get back here in time!
I can't eat this without catsup. Would it kill her to check up on us? Would that be a terrible thing? "How's everything? Do you need anything? What can I do for you?"
I've done that. Did you ever eat an ostrich burger?
(Thinking to himself) She's not concerned about the security guard. What kind of a person is this? I'm marrying a person who doesn't care that this man has to stand here 8 hours a day when he could easily be sitting.
You can't break up with me. I've got hand.
(almost gleeful) After Dinkins lost the election, he had a complete nervous breakdown. They had to lock him up.
I can't perform under pressure. That's why I never play anything for money, I choke. I could choke tonight. And she works in my office, can you imagine? She goes around telling everyone what happened? Maybe I should cancel, I have a very bad feeling about this.
Alright, I'll tell you what you do. You call her back and give her the "it's me", heh? Pull the old switcheroo.
(adamant) It's smart. It's a smart line, and a smart crowd will appreciate it. (shouting) And, I'm not gonna dumb it down for some bonehead mass audience!
No one gives us the finger! We're Yankees!
Nah, I gotta deliver some Christmas presents to my parents.
No, no no. That skips a generation. The baldness gene comes from your grandfather.
Hey uh, isn't Elaine supposed to meet us?
But she's gonna know that I like her more than she likes me.
Yeah, the super glossy. The best they had.
Sure, dudes in this town are dime a dozen.
I know. I just sort of leaned on it so it would look like it was mine.
Oh, right, right, the intervention. Should we leave?
Oh! Here you are. Ha ha...You, uh, you want to--
I cant believe how easy it is. Im virtually Orthodox. All I have to do is read a few books, memorize a few prayers, and Im in the club.
Oh, well th-that's great. It's really great. Hm hm mm.
But you are Blanche... You *are* in the shackles. Oh, I can't wait to read my *Time* magazine! Laaaast copy, too. Maybe I'll read it tomorrow-- in the park! It's supposed to be a beeyootiful day! Have a nice life... sentence, that is!
Well, I didn't really tell Susan about it, and she doesn't really have anything else to do.
Yeah. Thanks for, thanks for coming by fellas. Eh, got a set of keys, buried in the pothole.
Yo, dad. This is my boss, Mr. Kruger.
Well, I'm sure they'll be able to fix it. You can't stop modern science. Can't stop it, you can't stop it. Can't stop science. Can't be stopped, no way, no how, science just marches--
Hey, you know, there's this secretary at work that always had a crush on me.
Yeah. Never seen anyone so bored. I'm working like a dog here. Give me a moan. *Something*. I'd settle for a belch, for god's sake. All right, come on, let's have it.
That's a picture of me next to the coffin.
Yes, of course I'm taking Allison. This woman is genetically engineered to go to a ball. Tall, blonde, lithe--
Yes, the surprise blindfold greeting. That wasnt in the manual, I dont know.
I was just blowin' off a little steam. So what?
Wednesday? That's your personal business?! (stalks over to the counter) Skiing?! (angry) So let people suffer, while you're shushing all over a mountain?
What, are you, nuts? You're gonna spend more on the ticket than you're gonna get back from Grossbard.
(To the store owner) Excuse me, what do you think of these?
Y'know there are tribes in Indonesia where if you keep your coat on in somebody's house, the families go to war!
If you're in some situation where some fast cash will save your life, I'll give you the code.
You told him? What did you tell him?
Yes. Live, dammit. Live! Every precious moment as if this was the last year of your life. Because in many ways...it is. (There's a knock at the door.) Excuse me.
They wanted to read a Truman Capote book.
Ok, ok, fine! It's changed, it's not really the point. Anyway, I'm thinking of making a big move.
Well if you and I ever got into, like a really serious fight you know, and the punches started flying -- who do you think would win?
Yes, yes! The punishment should fit the crime.
Demi (the "i" sounds like an "e")? I thought it was Demi?
Guess who he put in charge of Fitted Hat Day? Me.
(scoffs) Those unions. (sighs) Okay. Sports,...movies. What about a talk show host?
So, Im thinking, as shes saying this, Im thinking great, the relationships over. But the egg salads on the way. So now I have a decision Do I walk or do I eat?
(light) No. No, no, no. The cushion was turned over.
Ohh yes, yes. Yes Jerry they were all over me. It was like Rocky 1, Hm. Diane came up to me, threw her arms around me
Yeah, yeah. I've heard that. Meanwhile I'm here with you in a parking garage, what am I supposed to do?
You are a genius, it's as simple as that.
U-ok. (George closes the window and shoos Elaine off. He opens the door to Monica.) Here you go.
Well, you know, I shouldn't have let you into Kramer's, now you want to go into Elaine's...she entrusted me with her spare keys, how can I just let you in?
I'd go to prison as your accomplice. I'd have to wear that really heavy denim. Go to the cafeteria line with the guy who slops those mashed potatoes onto your plate. Go to the bathroom in front of hundreds of people.
You got less than sixty seconds. That's like dismantling a time bomb. What got into you?
I meet this women, Sheila. She works down at the one hour photo pace. She's got this incredible smile. Like she's got extra teeth or something
(Stopping him) Ah, excuse me. When your, uh, when your wallet was open, I - I glanced inside, and I couldnt help but notice that you have several crisp dollar bills.
It it's huge. It's probably like North Dakota.
(he makes a sign to Jodi to wait and turns to Jerry) Jerry... This woman hates me so much. I'm starting to like her.
Would I want to see what Mary Todd wore to Lincoln's funeral?
I don't know. I don't think you're anything.
No, no, no. Just lately, I've been thinking a lot clearer. Like this afternoon, (To television) what is chicken Kiev, (Back to Jerry) I really enjoyed watching a documentary with Louise.
The nickname. George. What is that? It's nothing. It's got no snap, no zip. I need a nickname that makes people light up.
Wait a second. (George gets up and heads for the statue in Kramers hands.) I cant believe this! Let me see this.
(chuckling to himself) Housewarming gift. (swerving the car to go to the antique stand) All right, we're taking it up a notch!
This is what they would do in the movies! It's a beautiful thing! It's like a movie! I'm gonna slip him a mickey!
Uh, excuse me. (stopping them from rehearsing) Excuse me. (he walks to the guy's in charge of yelling "take #!") This--This is not right. May I? (the guy looks at George with a bothered face. George then walks up to Tom and takes him away from Jerry and Michael to talk to him in private)(to Tom) You see, you're going "They fooled *me* Jerry!" (George shakes his head with disapproval) You wanna hit 'fooled' more "They *fooled* me Jerry!". You see the difference?
(jubilant) Five thousand dollars? She doesnt have five thousand dollars!
(internally) How am I gonna get out of this? Think Costanza, think!
I was in the middle of a conversation.
No-no-no, we all chipped in. We have the money.
Morning Thunder has caffeine in it, Jerry doesn't drink caffeine.
How are they gonna make that book into a movie?
The door? Why would I go out the door? The window's right here.
Kramer was on Murphy Brown? That son of a gun!
And a guy will appear from out of nowhere. I say "Get out of here! What do you want? You don't belong here!"
I was throwing up all night. It was like my own personal Crying Game.
There you go, okay? That's my *other* friend's ticket. You happy now? You got two tickets.
Have you ever seen a Schnitzer's rye? It - it's huge!
(he drops a paper airplane he was holding) Mr. Wilhelm!
Well, it's not that. I just, you know, I thought that we were both uh...
I have to have my tonsils taken out.
She tolerated the strawberries and the chocolate sauce, but eh, it's not a meal, you know? Food and sex, those are my two passions. It's only natural to combine them.
(cocky laughter) Huh haha! (shouts) You're meat, Reilly! You just screwed yourself! (laughter) Ha ha!
No, I know I don't have to, I want to.
Oh geeeee. (George pantomimes sticking a knife in his heart, and twists it.) Go, go!
(hurriedly leaves Rudy's) They had plans, They had plans!
Well, I, I got the pilot of the Jerry show.
Alright, alright, I'll go on the date, but that's that.
They were in here, I saw her put 'em in here!
Yeah, but nothing happens on the show. You see, it's just like life. You know, you eat, you go shopping, you read.. You eat, you read, You go shopping.
(angry, to himself) The ocean called. Running outta shrimp. Outta shrimp! (a thought occurs) Oh! Yes! That's what I shoulda said! (frustrated shout) Dammit!
Yeah, ha ha, It's not the toilets, it's not the toilets. It's something else. Are you ready for this?
You didn't find it funny?! This is what I'm paying for?
Oh... do I have to write him a note or something?
Kramer, what the hell are you talking about?
Oh, hello, it's you! (angry) Listen lady, I got six minutes left on that meter, and I'm not budging til you admit you stole my twenty dollars. (smug) Huh-hu-hur, you're not so tough when you're not on your horse, are you Ruthie?
People always leave old things in their medicine cabinet.
Ovaltine. Have you ever had this stuff? Why is it called Ovaltine?
Ade, you're a wonder. (he he -- george laughs)
No no no, this ones different. This ones a beauty!
Oh ah, I uh, will have that for you by after lunch.
Hi (raises his left hand in a slight gesture to say hi)
(crestfallen) But you said it was my call.
Or, I could take the twenty, then I could pay *you* later.
Yeah. Where's he taking you, by the way?
No I can't. I can't die with dignity. I have no dignity. I want to be the one person who doesn't die with dignity. I live my whole life in shame. Why should I die with dignity?
My face! My face! Get me to the hospital!
(sitting down next to Jerry) Seeing Maura. Apparently, I was unable to break up beyond a reasonable doubt.
(sad) Yeah! Yeah. Hey--hey you, you know.. Maybe I'll call you sometime.
Dont insult me, my friend. Remember who youre talking to. No ones a bigger idiot than me.
Hey. Check these out. I just picked them up from Sheila. She must have loved these.
And she slaves to earn every penny. So that someday, I might be able to walk up to a woman and say, "Yes, I'm bald, but I'm still a good person."
Well, I like a rolling writer. They're very smooth.
It's like a magic trick. Sometimes I think it would be easier to bend a spoon mentally than to make that transformation.
I really can not comprehend how stupid people could be sometimes. Can you comprehend it?
So I finally stop and say, "Tatiana, I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but I think it would be best if I left".
Mrs. Sweedler thank you. Y-You see, this tragedy affected me in a very, very personal way.
Nothing. Uh, I don't know. I gotta go.
Ha! (grabs his coat and exits the apartment)
Ya, ya. I bumped into him on the bus. What did he have to say?
Me too, really. Unless you'd really like to get one.
Well what would be the point of that?
She said first row! Right behind the dugout!
I just remembered, I gotta be someplace. Yuh-hu-hur, that's enough. Pop. Pop, put down the wrench, Pop.
No, no, this is supposed to go to Joe Mayo's apartment.
Oh sure, sure. You wanna be alone, sure. I understand that, you wanna a little time to think uh thing..ponder things..you know..ruminant..(chuckles) you go ahead, lotta stuff on your mind..you think things out..Think, mull, mull, do a lot of mulling. (short laugh then exits Monk's)
WAIT ,WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!!!!.... Where was the tape recorder?
Its Martine. I think hes dying. He tried to kill himself with pills.
Listen Sheila it's not what you think. I put my trust into the wrong person. He said the key word was tasteful.
(distracted) Mm? (acknowledges Katy) Oh, hi. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. We met uh, skiing that time. You're uh, married to the eye guy.
That's right. I got his whole car downstairs.
What does she need? Maybe there's something that she needs.
I'll tell you what happened. I bet he got the AM/PM mixed-up.
What are you worried about, you know it.
(interrupting) You know we should really order, the service is so slow here, by the time you get anything...
That's exactly what I said, except I used the word "momentum".
"Jerry", oh my God. He wants to talk about "Jerry"?
Hi, it's me. It's Georgie Boy. What's going on?
I'm sorry about that lock on the liquor cabinet. The combination musta just flown outta my head. It's a mental block.
Just dropped in for a visit. You, uh, you never called me back.
Why don't you find a doctor that doesn't know your difficult.
I need like a bucket of water! I got a car overheating, I got an alarm that won't go off, I'm pressing 'one', I'm pressing 'two', nothing! What do I do?! Help me! Help me!
I just can't believe at the way people are. What is it with humanity? What kind of a world do we live in?
When are they gonna learn that any news about China is an instant page-turner? (seeing Jerry with a small black device) What's that?
I can't believe this! What was wrong with it? What didn't you like about it?
So I tell Alec that I have to go to Paris for an undetermined amount of time. Then all I have to do is buy some post cards and have your parents mail them from Paris.
I don't know if you're ready for it.
Where did this come from all of a sudden?
Well...maybe not as much as this bastard... (points at Zeke, they all laugh) I can hold my own! (they all continue laughing and drinking)
Then why don't you try and get him another job?
Well I can't now, Gwen's going to be there.
Of course not! Wash it, dry it, move on!
So, Marcy, you should've seen me in the hot tub yoday.
Yeah, Like I don't know that I'm pathetic.
(to Kramer) Ah! You're just the man I'm looking for.
Let me ask you a question. Who would win in a fight between you and me?
Oh no - I'm so sorry, it's the Moops. The correct answer is the Moops.
You know what? It doesn't matter, because I quit!
Yeah, the neck hole thing, and I would appreciate it if you would say you're sorry.
All right, I gotta make a call. Everybody out, come on.
What? Elaine's big-head guy? They have you the apartment?!
Well perhaps, not to the extent that you are. But I know the basic plot. Yeah.
I'm the assistant to the travelling secretary. I'm going on the road trips with 'em! I'll be on the plane... I'm working in Yankee Stadium! This is a dream, I'm busting, Jerry, I'm busting!
All he has to do now is count his blessings, say a prayer, and he's done. Do you believe this?
Of course not. You don't care what I look like.
'Maybe you know some little places to go, where they never close...'
Oh, I think that's fantastic. Good for you. Nice. That's very nice.
Maura. (starts acting dramatically, looking from Maura to Loretta and back again) Oh, my God! What are you doing here?!
I dont know why you even bother with this ping pong guy, Ill tell you that.
Yes, a shame. That is exactly how I would put it. Now Mrs. Sweedler, with all due discretion and sensitivity, and taking in the whole scope of the situation, I just can't help but think that, the hospital is somehow responsible for compensating the other, still living 'victim' of horrendous, horrendous tragedy.
Well, she doesn't really want to see Firestorm.
My name is George. I'm unemployed and I live with my parents.
Well you missed a lovely little party that we had for Grace.
I mean, now she thinks that I'm one of these guys that love her. Nobody wants to be with somebody that loves them.
(Snapping) Is that important, really? What is this, a police investigation? The woman's been through enough. She has to relive the experience now?!
Look, I'm doing you a favor. They're having an unadvertised sale. This suit is gonna be half-priced starting ... Monday.
You might want to try it...makes the movie more enjoyable, that's all.
I have to get in touch with Tatiana! And look at his little outfit. It's all so coordinated, the way his socks matching to his shirt. I really hate this guy.
(Puts his arms in the air, stretching, and covers his mouth with an arm) Could you ask her, just ask her. If she says no, case closed.
You arms look like something hanging in a kosher deli.
All right, I think they have fleas there. So what...
I feel like a huge weights been lifted off my shoulders. I... I... I feel happy! Kramer, I dont know how to thank you!
So I'm sure whatever germs it landed on were knocked out, and by the time the rest of them realised what was going on, you had already grabbed it out.
Y'know, now you gotta ask her her name. It's so embarrassing.
They made me buy it.. A hundred bucks this thing cost me. (Gesturing to the book) How dare they?! I got news for you, if it wasn't for the toilet, there would be no books.
And here's a roll that I think you may enjoy.
I will never understand the bathrooms in this country. Why is it that the doors on the stalls do not come all the way down to the floor?
This is George Costanza, I'm calling for my test results. Negative? Oh, my God. WHY! WHY! WHY? What? What? Negative is good? Oh, yes of course! How stupid of me. Thank you. Thank you very much. (he hangs up)
. . . I thought the woman was kind of cute.
No. I like the ball! This is my One Chance to make a Great Entrance! My whole life! I have never made a great entrance!
She thinks I'm a nice guy. Women always think I'm nice, but women don'tnice.
He never finished the sentence. He got a call, that was the end of the interview.
Aw, well, you know, it's your anniversary. It's - it's the least I can do. I - I just want you guys to go out and have a good time. Ha ha. So, you think we should, uh, we should get downstairs?
All right, but we're not buyin' it at Bloomingdale's. I will buy it, you pay me back later. I'll sniff out a deal. I have a sixth sense.
(excited) Did I tell you that story's relatable?! That was a great show! That is why I'm bringing it back to NBC.
You know, anything in the, in the lip area is good.
What was wrong with that sorry? It was a good sorry. Jerry, was that a good sorry?
He's extremely Murphy. He's Murphy to a fault.
So, tell him you're concerned about it and he should see someone else.
Youre not getting no Drakes Coffee Cake for fifty cents. Yae, Hey, Im all set. I got the ticket. Im going to the Cayman Islands this Friday.
I might tell her that I love her. I came this close last night, then I just chickened out.
What's the deal with Aquaman? Could he go on land, or was he just restricted to water?
(worked up) I'm aware! I'm aware!! But this is Marisa Tomei, Elaine. An Oscar winner! How can I live the rest of my life, knowing I coulda been with Marisa Tomei? She said I was just her type! She loves short, stocky, balding funny men!
You are not gonna believe whats going on with this woman.
Sure. I could go the tomato route. But eh, I've given this a lot of thought Jerry. All that frustration. Ill never get any work done. So Im doing a complete 360. Im going for total efficiency and ability.
All right, Dad, we're five blocks from the house. Sit sideways.
Wait a minute. This looks familiar. This reminds me of something. I can do this.
Yeah, sure, we met at Jerry Seinfeld's apartment. When you fumigated for fleas over there.
Great, great. So anytime you want you can just visualize her naked.
You want me to find a poem about Susan? May she rest in peace?!
They're for protection, Jerry. Can you tell where I'm lookin'?
(Looking at his finger) I think somethin bit me. I just need another nickel.
All right, I've got to go down to the unemployment office. Wanna take a walk?
look at this guy. Does he have to stretch in here?
Jerry, could you excuse us for a few minutes, please?
Well, Play Now has all kinds of different rubber balls. Why dont we test your bladder system at my office?
(to Jerry) Whos going to play left field?
Hey, grown-up. (they both chuckle, George notices Gwen enter the room) Oh my god, there she is. Go ahead, go ahead. (to the others) Let's go, let's go. All right what are they saying?
This is our new Vice-president of Acquisitions, sir.
Make-up sex? You have to have that right after the fight, we're way past that.
This is the thing where you go and you have to make your own pizza?
(thinks for a second) I got used to it.
There has got to be some way to get back into Pisano's.
Oh no, you're not going out on a high note with me Mr. Kruger!
You got a line in the Woody Allen movie?
That's it? You don't have to screw it in or anything?
What kind of a therapist are you? I'm telling I'm scared that something terrible is gonna happen to me, right away you start looking for tumors?
(Very loud in the direction of a waiter) I'm gonna need a coffee here. Very hot! Boiling!
Well I didn't know you wanted to go to the flea market.
So, were talking, and I dont like to go too long before I ask them out, I wanna get it over with right away, so I just blurt out, What are you doing Saturday night?
Sorry, you don't know what's going on out there! (looks at Owen) Who's he?
Not that much. You know, they tend to shrink in the water.
Oh, boy I was up to four in the morning watching the Omen trilogy.
Well, I can see that. What do you have to do that for? Who cares about your pants size?
Yeah, yeah. You gotta come over tonight. We can play.
Dad, he doesn't need to see the pole.
There's no house! It's a lie! There's no solarium. There's no Prickly Pete. There's no other solarium.
Yeah, yeah. Shes punctual... and uh shes been late, sometimes.
We are going to the Knick game! Michael Jordan!
She put them in her pocket book. She probably took them out there with her.
(ON PHONE) It's a '76 Chevy Impala. They stole it right in front of the hospital. I saw the guy drive off in it. Well he's about five feet tall, hairless, pink complexion.. (Elaine puts her finger on her nose) looks like a pig. Yeah, alright alright, thank you, thank you. (Kramer enters) So any word from the "pig-man"?
Excuse me, are you going to be much longer? I have to make a very important call.
Sweet guy (Receives the phone from Beth, Starts to talk to Jerry) Hello
This is totally different! That was my secret, this is Jerry's secret! There's...there's attorney-client priveleges here! If I play it by your rule, no one'll ever confide in me again, I'll be cut out of the loop!
Well, he said it could be cancer, maybe you should get it checked out.
I'm just asking, all they have to do is say no.
That doesn't explain the lipstick on the dashboard?
(Gloating) Hey, you got any extra furniture down there? I need some more stuff to fill that extra bedroom with the walk-in closet. (Smiles)
Listen, maybe we shouldn't start writing today. I got a lot on my mind.
Oh, yeah. You wish you had this coat.
Well you know in college they used to call me the little bulldog.
I feel terrible, I can't be responsible for breaking up a marriage. Oh no (starting moving for the door, Elaine begins to stop him)
I did it. Hunh, we're going out as soon as she gets off of work and it'll still be daytime. You know I, Im much better in the daytime then I am at night. it's less pressure.
Well, it's not my fault. You poked me!
Alright. 7,7, (points at himself) 6. I'm not gonna eat that much!
I'm a man. Jerry, I'm a man. And do you know why? It's because of that talk we had. You were my inspiration. Do you believe it? You. That lunch was the defining moment of my life.
Oh my God, an affair. That's so adult. It's like with stockings and martinis, and William Holden. On the other hand it probably wouldn't cost me any money.
Going backstage is the worst. Especially when they stink. You know that's a real problem.
We haven't heard his notes yet, we don't know how he feels about our work. (Russell throws up yet again.)
Well, I don't see why if you have his, he should have yours.
I just got here. My car broke down on the Belt Parkway.
We should have left earlier. I told you.
I just want the both of you to know how much you mean to me, and I love you both very, very much.
He didnt do anything, Jerry. Its a scam! Who told you to do that?
That's why the world's in the shape it's in.
March 21st. Hey! So, you're gonna back me on this, right?
What do we have in the fruit department?
He said that? (Daphne shacks her head) What a nerve. How dare he say something like that.
What do the Chinese have to gain by faking a cure for baldness?
What about me? I was a total failure. Everything was fine. Now this thing's gonna be a success and God's gonna give me a terminal disease.
(disbelief) What? (laugh) Wh... what're you talking about? I'm not the one with the problem. (defensive) Lloyd Braun was in the nuthouse, not me.
Yeah. Yeah. It's the only way. Come on. What are you, kidding me?
Aren't those the guys that always go crazy and come back with a gun and shoot everybody?
The way they make 'em these days, I'll never have to tell her.
(pointing outside) Why is there a Cadillac parked in front of the house?
(Holding out his arms - giving praise) It's beautiful. Now, what do I say?
(knocks on the window) Hey, why are all those people milling around my car?
(Yelling out to the whole coach) Funny guy! (Points to Jerry) Right here!
Because I kissed her in the meeting. Russell found out, he fired her over the phone. Finally, my stupidity pays off!
We are really late now. We're in big trouble. Big trouble.
Yup, y'know, they really spruce up the apartment.
Why? Why? 'Cause he's off his rocker! That's why.
(Laughs, snorts) I said, I said 'Get outta here! No story? Is that what I said?'
And isn't it more fun using the urinal?
Oh, I, uh, I disagree. You've, uh, you've been living in America too long. (indicates the bag of oranges) You've forgotten what it's like to have no oranges.
how did I know you were here? Something drew me here. This is phenomenal.
Jerry, it's fantastic. I love the people over there. They- they treat me so great. You know they think I'm handicapped, they gave me this incredible office, a great view.
Hey. I got Jon Voight's LeBaron. (Jingles the keys.)
Yeah, I do that too. I feel guilty about getting the pleasure. I feel like I don't deserve it so I talk. It stops me from enjoying it. There's nothing to eat in here.
...but is there any way that I could possibly have Neil's phone number?
I was personable. Don't you think I was personable?
(still by the door) What? M-Maura, what are you doin' here? I ended this relationship... twice!
Im the judge and the jury, pal. And the verdict is guilty!
Yeah my parents have it. Sometimes it skips a generation.
I was not winking you idiot. That was the grapefruit. It's like acid. I need that card back. It's Mr. Steinbrenner's. I was responsible.
Well? (Miranda hits George) I was just - I'm curious, that's all. We, uh. We'd like you to, do everything possible.
Doing quite well, thank you. Yesterday I had a soft boiled egg and a quickie. You know what? If I could add TV to the equation, that would really be the ultimate.
I usually spend Saturday afternoons with Susan. She's gonna want to know what I'm doing. I can't use Jerry, he's in Florida.
(excited) So then, as we were leaving, we were just kind of standing there, and she was sort of smiling at me, and I wasnt sure if she wanted me to ask her out, because when women smile at me I dont know what it means. Sometimes I interpret it like theyre psychotic or something and I dont know if Im supposed to smile back, I dont know what to do. So I just stood there like  remember how Quayle looked when Benson gave him that Kennedy line? Thats what I looked like.
Oh, what time is it? Eight thirty? I'll tell you what's on. You got Major Dad, Blossom, very funny programme...
(Needing to get away from his parents, he gets up) I need some air..
How do you know? What if pig-man had a two-seater?
How are you closer to him than me?
Missing his plane? Wasn't that a charter flight?
(puts down handset) Because he'll know I told you. Besides, he's giving me a parking spot around the corner for practically nothing.
You think she liked me? She seemed to like me.
Just put it on! All right now, remember she had her nails done today so remark how you like the color. And if you need me you beep me, all right. Here you go, hey, hey, hey, hey...(sprays Binaca into Jerry's mouth.) Go get'em you're a tiger!
Me? You see what he did here, you see how he tried to sneak into my space?
Well, it was a hell of a ride.
(urgent whisper) Elaine! You have got to get me Marisa Tomei's phone number!
Ow! What are you doing under there? Hey, stop that! Don't eat that! That's not food! (to Robin) He's suckin' down Equal packets!
No, no, no, no. Borrowing money from a friend is like having sex. It just completely changes the relationship.
Snoopy and Prickly Pete. Should I keep driving?
Well, it's the damnedest thing. The cat dies. So she comes back into town, she finds the cat lying on the carpet stiff as a board.
You remember my cousin Rhisa? I'm gonna date her.
I just feel terrible This is just terrible.
You know this whole thing never would have happened if you hadn't bailed out on me at the restaurant.
Y'know the average life span for an American male is like, 72. You're really... kinda pushin' the envelope there.
(Once again, Identifying) The Outlaw of Josey Whales!
And now for the trifecta. (Picks up a hand held TV and gets back under the covers.)
(starts to try to get passed Jerry and Elaine) Alright get out of my way. (Jerry and Elaine push him back, George very annoyed) Alright don't make me get physical here!
These are the balloons? Big deal, all I see is Woody Woodpecker.
Maybe he was going to say "Of course I have to check with my associates."
Tsst...'Course I have. Come on. My cousin's in a bubble. My friend Jeffrey's uh, sister, also ... bubble ... you know. I got a lot of bubble experience. Come on.
What are you? Satan? I'm close to a job here. It's my second interview with them.
I had a feeling you would like it. No, don't try it on now, try it on later.
So it was my comment that broke them up?
Mind? Why would I mind? I would love to wait! (shakes hands with Nana) Nana, nice to see you. Ni-ni-ni-ni-NANA! (embraces another guest, kisses her) Aunt Phyllis, always a pleasure. What a pleasure! Hey, let's do this again real soon. I had fun, huh?
Let's test him. Hey, driver. What do you say we stop off, pick up your sister, have a little fun back here? No, he can't hear us.
S-s-somebody double parked, we couldn't help it. It might have been Saddam Hussein, we're not really sure. He eh, had a British accent though.
You shook my hand in that coffee shop.
What kind of a shake does he have?
Um, all right, um, uh, I'll call 'ya. I'll call you and we'll talk on the phone. A telephone communiqu. Every thing is fine ok, uh, fine, .. [exits]
The uniforms! Did you see how they played? Listen to these comments! (reads from the paper) "Wade Boggs 'What a fabric! Finally we can breathe.' Luis Palonia 'Cotton is king.' Paul O'Neill 'I never dreamed anything could be so soft and fluffy.' "
You already have an in. You have the same first name!... (no reaction) 'Jerry'!
More wine and turkey? (Pours Celia more wine)
Can I uh, can I walk you back to work?
Listen, lemme ask you a question. What if I got a cup of coffee with her?
Boy, I wish the flamenco was popular here.
Aw, that's a fun age. (Jerry looks at George distastefully.)
Don't jinx it! Don't jinx (trails off quietly in elation)
All right, all right ( Goes to the bathroom)
Yeah. (Noticing this makes him out to be the bad kid, he gets defensive) Well, I couldn't run over there the way I was!
(to Jerry, yelling) You told her? She's not your wife!
(to himself) That's what I'd like to know.
Did you here that? I can't believe this he's eating his sandwich.
That's where the Seinfeld's are moving. They got a great deal. Yep. You know what they got in Florida? Jai-Alai! You bet on the games, you clean up.
And I always take care of my Pisano's. So here is a little something. (drop in tip and worker looks the other way, so George decides to take it out and try again only to get caught)
'scuse me. I uh, I was in here this morning and uh, I believe I paid you with a twenty dollar bill, (smiles) but you only gave me change for a ten.
Hello? I can take an hour off your hands. Give the kids a chance to see a real live Yankee.
I got it from the Institute. The Institute.
Great. Jerry, I gotta tell you, I had the BEST TIME with that Nina last night. I - I think I'm in love with her already. You are a great friend. (Hugs Jerry) A great, great friend.
I'm George. George Costanza, you live around here?
Well, you could move in with my parents. (chuckles)
I don't know. He said he wants to be my "key brother."
I think you absolutely have to say something to this guy. Confront him.
I know, I know. Listen, your stuff has to be done by now, why dont you just see if its dry?
What? Huh, so I had it all along. How d'you like that? (snorts) I guess I owe that cashier an apology.
(to Carrie) You know, you're really being very selfish. It would be nice if you would think of someone other than yourself every now and then!
What kind of plastic do you think it is? What do you think like that dry cleaning plastic?
Alright, then. We've gotten to the bottom of that.
Can I say one word to you? Lobster. The lobster here is unbelievable. (looks at the menu) Ooh, a little expensive.
Yeah. Hey, let ask you something. Is it just me, or - or do you find it unbearable to be around Jerry and that girl?
Wha..? I didn't tell you? I gotta go meet Elaine.
She probably never heard it. Don't you see what this means? It's like the whole thing never happened. It's like when Superman reversed the rotation of the earth to save Lois Lane!
I get the feeling when lesbians are looking at me, they're thinking "That's why I'm not heterosexual".
(surprise) Huh. I never heard you say you admire me for anything.
Well, I've given this a lot of thought, and I've gotta say...
Why did you refuse the package. Everybody loves a package.
Ade, ahh, ahh, ah ... Im giving you a raise!
He's getting phone calls here now? (he's standing near the counter and eating chips out of a big bag)
(Still holding the note) I think I'm having a heart attack.
(out the window) Keith, Keith, up here. Can you do me a favor? I need you to go to the unemployment office with me. I, I'm Jerry's friend  the guy from the locker room,  I'm the chucker. It'll take five minutes. Wait. Wait.
There she is. (waiving his arms quickly above the table - to nix the conversation) No no no no no no.
I love the chop sticks. I, I personally prefer a fork but they look very nice.
Yeah. Hey Jerry, listen to this. I discovered something even better than conjugal visit sex. Fugitive sex! Now, it's like everytime -
Uh huh. Uh huh! I think you spoke to your little friend Rachel, that's what I think.
Yes, yes, but uh, I have to make a call, so...
Oh my God...You're in jail? (Celia nods.) That is so cool!
What, are you crazy? It's a traumatic thing to be thrown up on.
Well do you want me to take it off?
How can you call yourself a clown and not know who Bozo is?
Oh yeah yeah, don't you know they used pastrami in that movie 9? weeks? Remember the pastrami scene?
I haven't even met the fiancee! Whatever! (Leaves for washroom)
I didnt know there was a fireplace. A fireplace, that's incredible.
So are you going to Todd's party this weekend?
It would have been nice if someone told me about it. I just think you could have said something. That's all.
You have my spare-key in your apartment, right?
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. It's from that grapefruit that Jerry squirted at me.
You don't have to pay for the massage?
Alright, just make sure he reserves the good chair for me. Wait, what are you gonna tell him about the clanking noise in the car?
Sounds like a scam. (takes a bite from the granola bar)
I got about fifty-feet out and suddenly, the great beast appeared before me. I tell ya he was ten stories high if he was a foot. As if sensing my presence he let out a great bellow. I said, "Easy big fella!" And then, as I watched him struggling I realized, that something was obstructing its breathing. From where I was standing I could see directly into the eye of the great fish!
I still don't see why I can't ask her about my arm.
All day. ( phone rings , Jerry picks up)
All right. Let's go over it again, one more time.
All right. At last, we're finally gettin' out of here.
So, Elaine, are you going to sleep with me or what?!
"Breakfast At Tiffany's." 90 pages. (Waves a hand like it's nothing.)
Jerry, my vacation just started. I need a day or two to de-compress. Besides, I did plenty today.
(animated) What're you talking about?! She's very concerned! She said she was gonna get it back.
Kramer, I cant believe it. Oh, youre my hero!
What could I do? Did you see the mug on that kid?
Yeah. (Points to two open seats in front of Jerry's. To Nina) Sit down there. (Sees Jerry in the crowd) Hello, Jerry. (Obviously angered at Jerry) I believe you know Nina.
Well, I feel better already. I'm feelin' like a good person.
So, uh, how long has this been going on?
Now, if this mechanic guy, was, in fact, eating a 5th Avenue bar, as he claims, wouldnt you agree he would have no problem picking one out from a candy line-up?
Alright, alright! (Goes out onto the sidewalk. The Seinfelds walk by) Seinfelds!
Course, I wouldn't, I mean uh, the guy is uh, well obviously (to Cynthia, as she passes) the guy has his problems.
Stop it! It's nothing. It's a stupid holiday my father invented. It doesn't exist!
(Annoyed) Yeah, yeah. We'll, uh, let you know.
You see I disagree. I'd rather be dating the blind. You know you could let the house go. You could let yourself go. A good looking blind woman doesn't even know you're not good enough for her.
Well if Houdini couldn't do it, what chance do I have?
My mother loves Hampton tomatoes. She's nuts for Hampton tomatoes.
Whoa, look at this. This is a beautiful suit. Huh?
Do you believe this? We're fighting. We're fighting.
I know, I know and you know *why* they're moving there?
Wha! You know, it's a pain to change that. You gotta lift up that plastic thing with a pen.
I don't know how you can let this guy handle all your money.
Yeah. So what's going on? We're gonna shoot the pilot and then it's gonna be on TV the following week?
King Edward. (snapping his fingers) King Edward, Jerry.
Well, it wouldn't fit you. The sleeves are too short.
What do you mean "might"? You don't think he really owned this car?
You know that coat was Gore-Tex. Its worth a hell of a lot more than that, cheap Chardonnay.
I can't eat with you leanin' over like this. Just look straight forward.
Yeah, and a whole new me. I'm up two inches in these babies!
He's right! It's the same thing with the femenists. You know, they want everything to be equal, everything! But when the check comes, where are they?
(looking at the door) He's starin' at us.
Take it off. You're going to ruin it.
I won fifty bucks! Boy, this is great. Too bad Elaine's not here.
You don't understand, there's a *blurb* about me in this magazine!
I got a feeling I'm gonna be much smarter than you pretty soon.
There was something so reassuring about that cozy little space.
What is this? Did you ever get the feeling like you've had a haircut but you didn't have one? I'm all itchy back here.
(on phone) . It's George Costanza. . are there any messages for me? Why does Mr. Steinbrenner want to see me in his office? . . . Communist? I'm not a Communist . . . . All right, all right. All right, I'll be there. - ( hangs up ) My secretary Ada, told Mr Steinbrenner I'm a Communist Now he wants to see me in his office.
No, Im saying, if a situation arose in which you didnt want it, I might take it.
I figured you'd cruise. At least through the Spring.
(Getting in a more panicked state) Oh God, Mommy!
I'm at the health club and while I'm in the pool, some guy walks off with my glasses. Who steals prescription glasses?
Oh, its a great place, its uh two-bedroom uh, west 83rd bout half block from the park.
An eye job? Ma, you don't need an eye job.
Uh, it was dangling! There were only two left in the machine! He mustve bought one, and gotten both.
It's like puberty that never stops. Ear puberty, nose puberty, knuckle puberty, you gotta be vigilent. Let me ask you this Do you know where Walker Street is downtown? I've got a league meeting there.
You got your own shampoo, conditioner, body lotion! Jerry, body
You know the anxiety you feel on a date? That's what I have every day now. My worst nightmare's come true, every day is a date.
It won't for a while. At least not until after the cast comes off.
Have you seen the new addition to the Guggenheim?
Aah! the minute I saw this girl, we just clicked. She's got such a nice face. hummmm her eyes, her mouth, nose
Yeah. Just take 'em out and ride 'em around for about..half an hour.
Oh no, I can't do it. I-I'm not good at these things, I get flustered. Once I tried to bribe an usher at the roller derby, I almost got arrested.
No. Nothing. Fine. (he sits at the table)
Anyway, I think everything else is okay. Unless of course she's faking.
Alright, this is what ya gotta do I need ya to go out to the parking lot at Yankee Stadium, take the flyers off my car.
Yeah, so what? I'm not the only one! (Kramer enters with his quilt.)
I always get myself in this position. Can't be on time. Gotta rush.
Pack of gum. Here you go. (hands the clerk a $100 bill)
I'm sorry - I have to say, I'm a little disappointed, I thought it would be a lot nicer.
Oh, I don't think you want to do that.
(glances upwards) Yeah. Uhm, why did she die so young?
(desperate) Steinbrenner had me committed! I'm in the nuthouse!
She had an itch. She could have used any one of those fingers. That finger was meant for me.
Oh I think I'd go for the back.
Look, why couldn't you make me an architect? You know I always wanted to pretend that I was an architect. Well I-I'm supposed to see her tomorrow, I-I-I'm gonna tell her what's goin on. I mean maybe she just likes me for me.
You're fresh (grabs her arm) You're very fresh. You seem very fresh to me. You're very vital. I couldn't take you any fresher.
My cousin worked for Bouchard's. They used to use the bouilla-base for a toilet. (Jerry and Russell are shocked.)
You can stuff you sorries in a sack, mister!
(Gestures for Kramer to shut up) Once again, Antonio, I can't even begin to say how deeply, deeply sorry I am about everything. The job, the cat.. (A lamp breaks) the lamp.
Jerry! I need you to get another picture of man-hands. I'm beggin' you!
And she didn't say something to you about a certain something?
I don't know, it sounds like pigeons or something!
A signal, right, um, okay, uh, okay, the signal is, Ill call out tippy-toe!
(gasping) I think I swallowed a fly! I swallowed a fly! What do I do? (He turns to a coffee shop patron at the counter.) What can happen?!
So, what? We're gonna do nothing now, this is crazy.
Just a suggestion. (chuckles and walks back to the yelling guy)
First class doesn't make it anymore. Now you get on the phone with Kimbrough, tell him what happened and tell him to get another plane down here, but this time, the good one - the Ted Danson plane.
Listen, you're lucking I'm not asking for a whole refund. (trying to speak quietly) You gave me ladies' frames!
Okay. (They walk around each other.) OK. Ill choose you. Whaddaya want?
I, I couldnt wait. I was too anxious to see you.
(frantic) Oh, Jerry Jerry Jerry Jerry Jerry, listen, if, if you are feeling uncomfortable about this at all, at all. Do not feel like you have to take it.
Dollar Eighty-Nine. Why is this a dollar eighty-nine? Why is there no haggling in this country?
You know it's like you never see a really attractive woman getting a traffic ticket.
(Vowing) Well, I'll tell you this, though - I am never doing.. that , again.
I mean it's gotten to the point where I'm flirting with operators on the phone. I almost made a date with one.
Yeah, yeah. You really cashed in on that favor pretty quick.
(getting excited) That's, that's incredible. My Cousin Vinnie, I love her, she was fantastic!
Dad, the hinges are all rusted here. That's why the wind keeps blowing the door off.
Oh, sure. Of course. (looks for place to set down flowers) Um, uh, could you hold these? For just a second, just a second. (grabs newspapers from trash bin, begins wiping windshield) Here you go, now don't worry about a thing. It's gonna be fine. Here we go. Look at this shine.
I'm interviewing all these annoying little overachievers.. finally, this kid walks in - Steven Koren - a regular guy.. likes sports.. watches T.V..
(Desperate to get rid of the book) Alright, I, I'll just take fifty. Do - do we have a deal?
Wa, uh, thank you sir, you know I am not quite sure I'm right for it.
I can't believe I missed Kramer. You know he asked me to go with him to California.
Well, it's less than twenty-four hours, so I guess I have to!
Oh, please don't tell me you love me again, Jerry, I can't handle it.
You're not goin to do it? What do you mean, You're not goin to do it?
How can you compare you parents to my parents?!
I don't wanna tell you how to run your show.
Well bear in mind that I am in the smaller office.
(Hangs up phone and pauses) this is great! He fired her! This is incredible, he fired her. I'm out, baby! I'm out!
How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria?
(angry undertone) Oh, I'm gonna give you a Royal bearing. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Lemme get a pack of gum here.
Did you see the way she pointed at the check? She gave me the finger.
What, you don't think I can attract beautiful, intelligent women?
(Frantically) Did anybody call here asking for Vandelay industries?
Anywhere in the city - I'll tell you the best public toilet.
Fragile Frankie Merman? I never liked that guy.
Mr. Morgan! Did you hear that? Mr. Morgan!
Yes, she wants me to like her, if she likes me. But she doesnt like me!
Oh yeeah.. well , Big smoker... I (coughs some more) gave it up for a while but it was too tough. Y' know.....I got no will power.
Same thing. My god, I'm getting married in December, do you know that?
(Defensively) You can look at them, but do NOT touch them. (Holds them out)
She's right, I heard Kramer got mugged out on the suburbs on a baby-sitting gig.
Yeah, yeah. Speaking of crazy, did you hear about Lloyd Braun?
I have noticed she does tend to go to the bathroom right after we finish eating.
I asked if I could borrow a sweater.
I need food, Jerry. I feel faint, I'm getting light headed.
No, no. No, no, no. (determined) We're staying on me. We haven't solved anything yet.
Yeah, well I'm thinking about getting out of town with Susan for a few days....Her parents rebuilt the cabin!
So they're flying the tiny instruments in from El Paso.
No. I need a guy that can rig a Frogger machine so that I can move it without losing power, 'cause I have the high score. H-hello?
That is what Mr. Steinbrenner wants. He wants, everyone, ta, twirl around.
Ha, Yeah right, hang on, Ill ah, Ill get her for you. he, he, he, he. Seriously, what's up?
Listen, listen, dont get worked up, cause youre gonna know the whole story the minute she steps off the plane.
Yeah, yeah, like it's just part of the conversation. Oh my boyfriend really likes watches. He's a real watch freak. We-e-ell that's fabulous. (snaps fingers in the air a couple of times)
Algae, obviously plankton, hmhm. I don't know what else I could tell ya, ah, Oh I-I just got back from a trip to the Galapagos Islands, I was living with the turtles.
"Well...there's no room for someone like that in this organization."
Ya know, I was just a little surprised.
You dont have to call that! Thats a rule!
D'oh...Oh, oh, the judge! I hate this guy!
I think you're right. You gonna eat that?
He still wins but it's not a blowout.
My father had a car salesman buddy. He was gonna fix him up real nice. Next thing I know, Im gettin dropped of in a Le Car with a fabric sunroof. All the kids are shoutin at me, "Hey, Le George! Bonjour, Le George! Lets stuff Le George in Le Locker!"
Jerry, a throat-clear is a non-verbal implication of doubt - he thinks I killed Susan!
Yeah. Yes! I just haven't seen you in a long time.
Oh, what are you, like, a Quaker now?
(incredulous) I look just like him. I. Me. (flings his arms out) This! This is what her boyfriend looks like. How is that possible?
Oh hey, by the way. Do you want a box 'a, Cuban cigars? I smoked one last night. I got nauseous.
Yeah, and she's going to find I'm a moron. You know, people think I'm smart, but I'm not smart.
Well who schedules his wedding on Super Bowl Sunday?
What about the Coast Guard? Seems like a lot of pride there, a lot of tradition.
I thought he was just gonna have a muffin.
(removing his glasses) You know, Hawaii could be a little tricky right now, there's a lot of high pressure winds down there this time of year, there's a lot of debris constantly flying around. Wood, and uh, lava, pretty dangerous.
Play Now thinks I got problems in both legs. My own personal Rascal, Jerry. On the house.
Yes, well, if the other people in the office saw that I called an exterminator, they would just panic. Besides, this is sort of a friendly visit. Carl, right?
Uh, Carol, can I talk to you for a second? Right now?
Ma, will you stop?... Its just a statue!... How is it my fault?!... It was stolen. I didnt even touch it this time... Okay, fine... I dont see why this should affect to potatoes!... Okay... Goodbye. (George hangs up.) She doesnt react to disappointment very well. Unlike me.
Mothers say things. My mother goes babbling on and on like a crazy person.
Allright, I gotta head back right away, I'll-Ill -- I gotta figure something out here.
Yeah, yeah, yeah we could. You know, ah, Kramer, the next time you talk to her, find out if she knows Kelly, from Monk's. I wanna know if she really has a boyfriend.
I gotta prep. I need a couple of anecdotes, a few you-were-right-abouts. It's a whole procedure. Wasn't Fragile Frankie the one that used to run into the woods every time he got upset?
Well, I've to every Brentano's. This thing's flagged in every database in town!
(Not wanting to make Elaine mad) I guess it's not important.
Thanks a lot. Ill give it back to you in a week.
But, but I'm disturbed! I'm depressed! I'm inadequate! I got it all!!
That's what nuns and Red Cross workers are for.
Danielle. Where's Neil? (indicating the bed) Is this him?
Because I'm a cheater! I had to tell you.
Well, I'm not buying it. No way. Forget it. No way I'm buying this! (beat) I mean, look at it! What is it? It's a bunch of squiggly lines! (beat) Are you telling me you couldn't paint this?
A backup system? We're designing bathroom doors with our legs exposed in anticipation of the locks not working? That's not a system. That's a complete breakdown of the system.
We were expecting about two hundred people...Well...Thank you , thank you.
The catering hall screwed up. The wedding is delayed until June. It's like a stay of execution.
(walking towards the door) I couldn't leave well enough alone?!
Monica, I'm really focused here, this stuff's a killer. (turns to the next page)
You know what I do at the Yankees, when one of these old guys is breathing down my neck?
I don't know, I don't know, you'll think of something.
No, they're not funny at all. No, I have no funny friends. I'm the funny one. El Clowno.
I like this area. I could live out here.
I like, uh...(mutters something unintelligible under his breath.)
The story is the foundation of all entertainment. You must have a good story otherwise it's just masturbation.
No, I dont want it. I want it, if you dont want it.
so, uh, Steven.. I see you're president of the chess club.
What kind of a sick person would do a thing like that?
Absolutely. Because instead of doing a wash, I just keep buying underwear. My goal is to have over three hundred and sixty pair. That way, I only have to do wash once a year.
You're cutting me off? No, no, no Jerry, don't cut me off!
Woo! Courtside! (mock-snide) Is that the best you could do? Ha ha!
No good? All right, uh how about Art... Cor.....
All right, so are you ready, so we'll go out and get something to eat.
And you met her in an antique store! I don't know how you do it!
All right, I'll tell you what... why don't you go into the store and I'll wait in the car?
I was all primed for the first row; I was gonna put my feet up on the dugout!
I mean he's a good fighter and a nice guy but I don't like him.
Theyre the ones who should be ashamed. They signed me to a one-year contract. As long as I show up for work every day, they have to pay me.
Very exciting, very exciting, it's like watching a birth.
Well, maybe they're done with it. I could go pick it up.
Here, just give me a couple of napkins.
I, I really should go home. Ya.. actually I'm planning on spending the day with my father tomorrow (short laugh) we're uh we're going to a father-son picnic, just the two of us.
I told ya. Hey, any of you guys want to come out and help me fix my father's screen door in Queens?
Oh, no no no, I'm fine. Let me help you with these dishes, huh?
Oh they'll get out of the way. You really smell banana?
So, I've got ice cream all over my face. There were no napkins there. Whoever it was that's responsible for stocking that concession stand cost me a relationship.
Yeah, look at me. Now I GOTTA FIGURE OUT THE HAT SIZES OF 59,000 DIFFERENT PEOPLE!! WHAT IF A PINHEAD SHOWS UP. I GOTTA BE ON TOP OF THAT.
Because filth is good. Whaddaya think, rock stars have sponges and ammonia lyin around the bathroom? They, have a woman comin over, Ive gotta tidy up? Yeah right, in these matters you never do what your instincts tell you. Always, ALWAYS do the opposite.
...and then when I saw the photo I remembered where I'd seen him; the boom box incident.
Why don't you just look at your watch?
Yeah, "duty". Do you know how much duty is?
She probably gets that impression because you're cool. You're under control. Like me. Nothing wrong with that.
When you sent me the-the bill for the dry-cleaning. I thought the show didn't have a chance.
So the Wig master.......the Wig master said you could stop by the theater tonight.. and he'll show you around.
Yes, but I still don't feel right about letting you into Kramer's apartment without his permission.
(whistles disapprovingly) Ho ho ho, Had to? Had to come in?
Who's dressing you? (Laughs) You look like a complete idiot! You know, I wouldn't wipe my- (Unable to take anymore, Leslie gets up and shoves George violently. His hands go straight for the hot iron sitting on the dressing room table. George screams out in agony) AAHHHH!!!!! (his voice is heard outside the building, on the street, and in the park were a bunch of pigeons are scared by the yelling)
This is not a Metallica concert, it?s an opera alright, a little dignity, a little class, just give me my ticket, I will stand over here and sell it.
I dunno, I'm in a limo. (dials) Hello ma? It's me. Guess where I am. In the back of a limo. No, nobody died. It's a long story, I can't tell you now. Because I can't. I said I can't. If I could, I would. Would you stop it? Alright, look, I'm getting off. No, I'm not telling you! How's this? I'm *never* telling you! I don't care! No! Fine! Never!!
This is amazing. (George gets up to leave and shake's man's hand) Thank you. Thank you very much. . . . I'm going back in! . . . You'll feel better (to woman)
Behind the dugout, are you kidding? How did you get them?
I don't know. Perhaps I can better serve the world this way.
Why?! Because you were stabbed, and.. got coffee thrown in your face, and.. uh.. (Points to Alan's bandaged forehead)
Yes, you know. Deal with it .We have to deal with the doubt, Susan The DOUBT!! Must be dealt with.
(agitated) Alright, I gotta try and talk my mother into taking him off my hands.
Oh, no, no, no...you sit right here...I will get you a nice snack.
Do you uh feel the way you feel after the Risotto?
What do you mean you didn't think I wasn't gonna use them?!
Never! It is a part of me. I will just return the chair, and it will be easy, because the receipt is in my good friend.
Wait a minute, wait a minute, do you think I?m comfortable here. I can't change, I?ve got no clothes here! You've got to go like that, I can?t go like this alone!
I dont know. All of em. Theyre all crooks! Besides, I couldnt get all different candy bars, anyway.
You know, you're nuts with these sponges. George is gettin' frustrated!
Again with the checked out. I'm not going to the doctor. If I don't to the doctor, then nothing will happen to me. If I go he might find something.
I like history. Civil War. Maybe I could be a professor, or something.
Well, you know, I've been lyin' about my income for a few years. I figured I could afford a fake house in the Hamptons.
What did they put on this tuna? Tastes like a dill, I think it's a dill.
Nah, he didn't have anything to do with it...
It's like I'm Neil Armstrong. I turn around for a sip of Tang and you jump out first.
I left three messages. I can't believe this woman. She has sex with me, leaves ten minutes later then I never hear from her again. What kind of a person does this? I mean, she used me. I feel cheap and violated.
I wonder if, ah, Susan ... (picks up the phone from the coffee table, then decides not to call) No. I better just go. (claps hands) heh. All right! See ya. (grabs his rain coat from the hook by the door and rushes out)
Well, if I hear you correctly--and I think that I do--my advice to you is to finish your meal, pay your check, leave here, and never mention this to anyone again.
Would you believe my luck? The first time in my life I have a good answer to the question, "What do you do?" and I have a girlfriend. I mean, you don't need a girlfriend when you can answer that question. That's what you say in order to get girlfriends. Once you can get a girlfriend, you don't want a girlfriend, you just want more girlfriends.
(crying from the onion) You'll see I'm right.
(checking his watch) Hey, let's get the check, she's taking the bandages off at four o'clock.
(Annoyingly butting in) Kinda like Superman's fortress of solitude.
I said 'God bless you'. Was that so wrong?
Oh, that's the worst part of it. He looks just like me.
You would think that, but either youre born with a sense of humor, or youre not. Its not going to change even if you go from the red sun of Krypton all the way to the yellow sun of the Earth.
Oh oh oh, all right, fine, Jerry, you win. Take it, just take it!
She happens to be very good friends with her.
Hey, is it my imagination, or do really good looking women walk a lot faster than everybody else?
Regardless. I had to walk around for the rest of the party in some cheap Metlife windbreaker. Now, it is payback time.
Sure. So, uh, Jerry, there's an empty apartment in my building. If you and Hallie want, we could try and hold it, may...
I told her I liked her. Why? Why did I tell her I like her? I have this sick compulsion to tell women how I feel. I like you I dont tell you.
Oh ho! Class, huh? At Columbia? Let me tell you something, pal. I called the registrars office. I checked you out. They have no record of a Ray Thomas at that school! You liar!
You see that woman on the horse? (points)
Well I'm very excited about this. I've always wanted to see how those sketch artists do it.
Well, they're more than an underwear to me Mr. Farkus. Two cups in the front, two loops in the back. How do they do it?
Just tell her whatcha want, they'll make it for ya.
(running out and away from the van) I knew it wasn't Berkowitz!
Yes, well, if you had never taken your keys back from Kramer, he never would have taken his back from you and given 'em to me, in which case I wouldn't have had to take mine back from her.
(getting up out of his chair to get out of the Mohel's way) No, No.
Get out of here. I didn't see any cameras there.
I dunno, Jerry somethin's missing. There's a void, Jerry, there's a void...
Wait, have you ever seen him throw up?!
You know. (All three give him blank stares) I was alone..
The, uh, actor that played Jesus made some odd choices.
My moneys all tied up in change right now.
You're in the movie? Is he in the scene?
Well it's not up my alley! It's one thing if I make it up. I know what I'm doin, I know my alleys! You got me in the Galapagos Islands livin' with the turtles, I don't know where the hell I am.
See? This looks right to you, doesn't it?
(after hesitating, resignedly) All right. (He sits down and smiles unconvincingly at her)
I was doing standup comedy in Kennebunkport Maine. ??? night club. The stage was on a cliff and the audience was throwing all the comics off.
You know I'm enjoying it very much. I think my coworkers are really taking to me.
That woman was unequivocally the worst date of my life.
Oh, its from Les Miserables. I went to see it last week. I cant get it out of my head. I just keep singing it over and over. It just comes out. I have no control over it. Im singin it on elevators, buses. Im singin it in front of clients. Its taken over my life.
(surprising his parents in the kitchen) Welcome back.
Oh, this is fabulous. My God Elaine, you have to taste this.
Remember when you came to audition for us?
When you're playing the piano do you think about me?
Oh, Hey, eh, there's a spot right in front of the liquor store. You see
(clears throat) Maura, I, uh- I want you to know... I-I've given this a lot of thought. I'm sorry, but... we, uh, we have to break up.
But it--eh.. It was here, I'm tellin' you, an' w--w--it was really here! The, there was, a, bar, and a, an' a dance floor..
Well, OK. As I said the guy had it in for me. He actually failed me in gym. ... ME!
Well how do you even know its hers? Maybe it belonged to Carol. Did you see a name on the tube?
What are you up to now, uh, Step Nine?
Yeah, yeah. I see the irony. All right. What about this? What if I can find some way to break up with her so that she'll still like me and it doesn't affect the deal.
I know. Don't you see. (emphatic) He was doing it to fool Lloyd Braun!
(frustrated) No. No, no, no. You're not helping me.
If you don't mind, sir. I'll be here at 8.
You see this is the thing. . . . (crying) I just feel . . . mumble, cry, mumble, . . . I'm scared. You and I together, (cry)
I could go bumper to bumper with any one else on this planet!
I gave her a twenty, she only gave me change for a ten.
No! I'm not gonna do that! That's one step away from personal ads! And prostitutes! No! No, I am not going down that road! What does she look like?
The name's George Constanza. I'm starting work here today. I was wondering if you could tell me where my office is.
No, I can't. What if I meet a woman? I'd always be worried about that first moment where I'd take it off and see that look of disappointment on her face.
Oh, I think it is! I think that's exactly what it is!
No not vast (he pronounces it as "vost")
We, uh, we go on foot from here.
All right, shmoopies...what's it gonna be? Pick a theater.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's it. More of that, difficult. I'm a difficult seed.
Yeah, just tell him to hurry it up.
Does Neil like to eat a big breakfast?
You know it must be impossible for a Spanish person to order seltzer and not get salsa. (Angry) "I wanted seltzer, not salsa."
So, let me ask you. Do you think I could have done this?
It's, uh, it's not a little chicken. (laughing) Little chicken. It's a gamebird.
It moved! It was imperceptible but I-I felt it.
Oh, I had no choice. She squeezed it out of me! Shed tell me she loved me. All right, at first, I just look at her. Id go, Oh, really? Or uh, Boy, thats, thats something. But, eventually you have to come back with, Well, I love you. You know, you can only hold out for so long.
I know what I'm doin'. In fact Mr. Wilhelm gave me one of those little stress dolls. All right. (gets up) Back to work. (acts annoyed and leaves)
No! I don't! Don't you even care? This is your company! It's your name on the outside of the building! Speaking of which, the 'R' fell off and all it says now is K-uger!
Well if she can't tell "six" from "sex" then how is she going to lip read from across the room?
(animated) It failed here! Because, here, every time you turn on a TV, all you see is four morons sitting round an apartment, whining about their dates!
No, you're not taking a deli slicer to my boss...
(Outraged. Leaving) Well, you just lost a lot of business! Because I love to read!
The government is very touchy about us being in the air. Let us run around on the ground as much as we want. Anything in the air is a big production.
(Angry) Yeah, that's what they told me the last time.
Oh, I was trying to make a point.
Oh you mean face down on her chest.
They're men with jobs, Jerry! They wear suits and ties. They're married, they have secretaries.
Well don't let him take advantage of you like that.
No...Why should that make any difference to you?
Elaine, of course I'm concerned. I'm payin' for those meals. It's like throwing money down the toilet.
The parakeet in the mirror. That's a good one, Stu.
try shaking it...(long pause) Well,Janet should be here any minute.
Ohh, I have tremendous respect for people who work with feet. I mean, to dedicate yourself to the foot - you're toiling in virtual anonymity. I mean..
You never should have taken away his keys!
All Simons was able to find out is that hes in the hospital.
I'm bored. She's boring, I'm boring, we're both boring. We got out to eat, we both read newspapers.
I just popped in now. I'm a big pop-in guy.
Whatever. Believe me, if I wasn't involved right now, I wouldn't mind being set up. Something tells me she's a knockout. (we see, from the camera inside the cab, George's hand waving as the cab drives away)
Oh my God! (coming out of bathroom) You know what I just realized?! If they get divorced an' live in two separate places? That's twice as many visits!
Well this is bad. I am really in a bad situation now.
Woo! Some day out there - You ever see weather like that? Woo! It's crisp - it's crispy crisp.
No, its not a problem, I can get rid of the apartment this afternoon.
Well that was a really stupid thing! You know what's going to happen now?
There's a hundred different things here. What's the difference between these two? (They each grab a box and check the ingredients) You got propylparabin?
I know. And now they want me to bottle it up. It makes me so mad!
Well, you know, if I uh, wasn't engaged.
Still, I bet when they gave him a plane, it was a lot nicer than this one.
Festivus, Sir. And, uh, I was afraid that I would be persecuted for my beliefs. They drove my family out of Bayside, Sir!
Hey, so get this. I get a call this morning from one of the Mets front office guys. They wanna take me out to lunch.
(waving) How can I not think about it? Look at the size of this thing.
I never should have brought her up there. Should have known better. Should have seen it coming. I didn't see it coming.
What're you doing? What're you, telling secrets? What're you laughing at?
In every situation. No matter how silly I look. (Tastes his Clams Casino) Hm.. tastes a little funky.
You start flirting with him and I'll come by and, while you're keeping him busy, I'll slip it in his drink.
You know, I cant believe youre even considering not playing. We need you. Youre hitting everything.
Ohooo what are we going to do? I'm shaking! I'm shaking!
So you thought she was good looking and figured this would be a good way to meet her.
Um, excuse me, I think you forgot my bread.
(Nervous, his voice cracks) Hey, Antonio. How's it going?
All right, forget that idea, it's not for you....Okay, okay, I got it. You run an antique store.
He's coming up?! (Moves to the door) I'll check you out later.
(going into the bathroom) Well, you on all fours, that thing vibratin', kickin' up sawdust, ho ho! She'll get the picture!
Ah, Pfft! What can you do? (looking at a tag on the suit) Is this the price tag?
(clipping on shades) Ha.. She'll have to find me first. (leaving)
Here's the TV. I know you wanted to watch the Super Bowl. Do you at least have some towels we could sit on? It's, like, a four hour game.
Alright, that's it. Alright, good, eight thousand dollars. (to Cynthia) Cynthia, again, nice meeting you. Have I commented on the shoes? I love suede, it's so thick and rich. Did you ever, you ever rub it against the grain? Alright, anyway...
I didn't even know Fulton was in the hospital.
I just wanted to talk to Tony for a minute (hands Elaine some stuff)
Out. (Jerry shakes his head in agreement) Wow. I spend so much time trying to get their clothes off, I never thought of taking mine off. (Jerry nods; George looks at his watch) Alright, Hey come on, get out of here, Dophne gonna be here any minute.
Were having lunch with a friend. He works in the building.
Pulp can move, Baby! Why didn't you eat a real breakfast?
Be careful, you're getting blood all over the car.
Ah hah. You see Father, Im Im incredibly anxious to become a member. Um, dont you offer any kind of an express conversion? A quick change?
(Nervous) Wh-what are you talking about? That - that's rediculous.
And I am not a piece of toast.
I don't even like to use urinals, always been a stall man.
(gleeful, to Estelle) You did?! That's Goood! That's very good! I'm very glad to hear that.
Listen, I gotta ask you I was a little concerned that perhaps I was responsible in some way for your, uh... metamorphosis.
"BECAUSE IF HE CAN'T JUMP. THERE GOES MY SNEAKER BUSINESS!!"
It's not that easy. It's like "Beat The Clock," there's a lot of pressure there.
Listen, I have a tremendous favor to ask.
Alright the administrator's on the third floor. I'll meet you guys back at the car.
Who cares about eyebrows? Is she sweet? I like sweet. But not too sweet, you could throw up from that.
(shaking his head, weary) It doesn't matter. (he leaves)
I had the perfect situation here, he was shouldering half the load.
Yes it is. She just took credit for my salad. That's not right.
Is that what I ask for? The BIG salad?
Yeah, good luck. Hey I'll meet you outside.
Yeah, well, she's trying to track you down.
Step-skipper. That man is a step-skipper! He skips Step Nine!
(standing) Yes, payroll. Yes I did. Very productive. Payroll... Paid off.
Because I uh, I told her the truth.
You know what I never understood? Why did they change the siren noise? When I was a kid it was always "waaaa, waaaa", you know now it "woo-woo-woo-woo-woo". Why did they do that, did they do some research? Did they find that woo-woo was more effective than waa?
Nah, I guess I should really get moving on this, huh? I'm gonna go. (Opens the door, letting Newman in. Leaves)
See, didn't bother Susan either. That's why I'm different. I can sense the slightest human suffering.
Kramer, Kramer, I need to know if Nina is refunding.
hey, you know what? I just remembered something. I had a dream about that guy last night. This is amazing.
He knows this guy, Wilkinson. He made a fortune in the stock market. Now hes got some new thing. You know, theres supposed to be a big merger. He wasnt even supposed to say anything. You guys should think about doing this too.
I'm wearin' a little hat, I'm jumpin' through fire.. They're puttin' their little alien heads in my mouth..
(cuts into Jerry talking) Chocolate chip mint? Oh well, actually Jerry I prefer chocolate chip. What is it about the chocolate and the mint that makes it go so well together?
She's been locked up for two years. She's gonna want to make up for lost time. Dinners. Movies. (Rubs his forehead.) Talking...
No, he said there was nothing he could do, and next time I should probably break the Prozacs in half.
Eh eh eh, can't do it, can't do it, sorry, I got a date.
You know how hot it gets there? Like 150 degrees. Your skin is gonna be simmering with boils.
(shouts) Of course there's something wrong! (points at Jerry) We had a pact!
(feigning excitement) Great, great. O-Oh, oh, oh, gosh. You know, it's just... my duties with the Yankees...
Well, if I could talk to the mothers and have sex with the daughters, then I'd really have something goin'.
Oh, no no no. I pay what I say.
Hey, what about this? I'm in a car accident. The motorist is uninsured, you with me?
Maybe she moved it up in the rotation.
Well if you didn't think I was parking, why did you put it in head first?
English. Does anybody speak English .Nobody speaks English.
Mmm, no. Boy, it really didn't come out too well, did it?
I'm gonna read a book. From beginning to end. In that order.
(Putting his hands up) Alright, alright, hold on! (Jerry has George's full attention) Time out! Woah, woah! (Scooting in, giddy) What did she say?
(thinking of the moans) Heh. (Karen takes another puff of her cigarette) You seem like you really enjoyed your Risotto. (chuckles) You have a very contented air over there. (chuckles again) You look very contented, very satisfied. (pauses) Are you satisfied?
So we jump and roll, you won't get hurt.
Ponce de Leon? Okay. (to Jerry) You sure you don't wanna go?
Well I can't break up with her now.
You know, if I could get this Coco woman down to Kruger, they wouldn't be able to call me Koko anymore because Kruger would never allow 2 Kokos.
When are they gonna have the flying cars, already?
Why do I get pesto? Why do I think I'll like it? I keep trying to like it, like I have to like it.
I need higher. This has paba in it, I need paba-free.
What for? . I'll tell you what for.... for hair.
(swerving) Hey! Watch it! Did you see that guy? He just gave me the finger!
Wait a second, wait a second...and then the butler says, "I'm not cleanin' it up! I'm sick of cleaning!"
I leave you alone for two seconds, and this is what you do! I trusted you!
Ha Ho! (he turns and walks out the door)
Im outta there. I did it! Its over.
Yeah, he's in my bed. I'm sleeping on the couch.
Hey, yeah. My parents want to come too, is that ok?
All right. All right. Let's not get into panic mode! Let's not make a big deal outta this thing or we're never gonna get through this night.
I went to the beach. (Jerry and Elaine exchange looks)
You gotta give us odds. At least two to one - you gotta put up two-hundred dollars.
Why'd I think it was timbre? Yeah, she could do voiceover commercials, why didn't you tell me about her voice?
Oh no no no no - we have to be in California next week. We're starting a TV show.
Because great couples always have a great story about how they met. That's why I've never been in a long term relationship. I've never had a good meeting story.
I noticed you eh, chose the eh "clowns with balloons" check design.
(thinking to himself) Oh my god, there she is. That's the face, just like the picture.
Cold? How are you going to do that? You're not one of those guys.
Jerry, I'm not suggesting getting rid of the girl. She's integral.
I noticed people staring at my head because they like what they see.
They wish. I hate the big broker-houses. Hate them with a passion. Big broker-houses killed my father.
Your boyfriend reads the Daily Worker? What is he? A communist?
No, Ill put half a can of mousse in my head like you.
What d'you mean, let 'em go? They're spending all my money.
Yeah, yeah, and we started talking, and she's this lawyer who's incredible! Everything I said was funny! You know, she laughed at everything I said, she thinks I'm hilarious. You know in a way, it was almost too good. I started so good, I can't go any place but down now, ya know? I got no place to go.
See, Steinbrenner is like the first guy in, at the crack of dawn. He sees my car, he figures I'm the first guy in
You paying my hotel and airfare to Miami?
Did I tell you?! Did I tell you?!
Do you wanna talk about hotels, or do you wanna win some ball games?
How you gonna catch him? He's probably boarded the plane already.
Oh no no no, they don't want to join us.
Because I cant call a woman with other people in the room. Come on, lets go.
Well what about all the Lloyd Braun sales?
'Cause believe me, I would only say this to you and maybe a psychiatrist, maybe. Well, her nose is a little big.
Maybe the baby would like to see my spot. A positive, uplifting message to start his life out with. Huh, You can still get a great space in this city - if you apply yourself.
Well, it's . . . much too low.
I think it moved. Oh my god, I think it moved. Yeah, give me the big piece. I'll see you later.
Oh, *please*! Me? C'mon! That's *great*! Are you kidding? I think thats fan*tastic*! I've always encouraged experimentation! I'm the first guy in the pool! Who do you think you're talking to?
Huh, he's a communist. . . . Look at this. "Exciting uninhibited woman seeks forward thinking comrade and appearance not important." . . . Appearance Not Important! This is unbelievable. Finally this is an ideology I can embrace.
Get out!! (Jerry gets out and George drives away. A couple of guys notice Jerry in his cowboy boots.)
I can do six weeks standin' on my head. I'm a sexual camel. That's not the point. At least there was the possibility.
So what do you want me to do?
Excuse me. Am I talking to you, Pinhead? Am I?!
Take toilet paper for example. Do you realize that toilet paper has not changed in my lifetime? It's just paper on a cardboard roll, that's it. And in ten thousand years, it will still be exactly the same because really, what else can they do?
Okay, uh, look, if you want to just keep on doing the same old thing, then maybe this idea is not for you. I, for one, am not going to compromise my artistic integrity. And I'll tell you something else, this is the show and we're not going to change it. (To Jerry) Right?
That's insulting! Ted Danson makes eight hundred thousand dollars an episode.
Coffees coffee in the morning. Its not coffee at twelve oclock at night.
Yeah, what is he? Some sort of an instigator?
(Obviously knows that, but pretends he doesn't) What, tonight? Now?
Me? It wasn't me I never even saw the ball. All you do is dribble.
Like what? I'm bald? What is it specifically? Is, is there an odor I'm not aware of?
Oh. This I need. Hello!! Hello. i..i..is this the hair restoration clinic? ...Does anyone speak English?
I gotta stay one step ahead of Neil.
Yeah, and, ... Why won't this go down?
The cabin.. (Laughs nervously) Well.. (Pauses as he thinks of a way to break the news, then decides to pass it off) Susan?
(signs) Sorry. (expectant) You're sure, uh, there isn't anything else?
You never had sex in the office before?
All right, Puddy, listen, and listen good I need to know the name of that mechanic that walks around here. Big guy, a liar. Short name. Sam? Moe? Sol?!
(Chuckling) yeah. Uh, oh, here's your sunglasses. (Hands them to her)
I tell you this. If the real Phil Rizzuto was down there, this wouldn't be happening!
Oh uuh, sure, why not. (the blind man hangs on to George's arm) Hey, that's the guy.
Hey! (to Elaine, who doesn't look too cheerful)
Well, I gotta do somethin'. (Walks over to bathroom. Kramer enters)
What, you're gonna take her word over mine? I'm your best friend!
Parker, I never said driver, I said parker, a great parker.
Drink your soda! Come on! I know you're there, laughing at me. Laughing and lying and laughing! I had to go to Reggies, Jerry! Reggies!
(still looking at that picture) You know if I told my engagement story to that receptionist, but told her this, was my fiance..
(Getting up) You know what? Maybe I should take off.
All right. That's more like it. Thank you very much. (giving the sponsor the 'be strong' hand clench) By the way, my uncle was an alcoholic, so...
Well, I gotta go back there and try again. Hi Sheila.
(positive) Yes. From endorsing checks for the Super Terrific Happy Hour. (laughs)
There he is. Right on time as usual.
Ah, shut up, Jerry. My parents think they can ignore me. Heh heh. Well, they better think again.
How could you be a doctor and not say "get outta here"? It should be part of the training at medical school "Cancer? Get outta here!" "Go home! What are you crazy? It's a little test. It's nothing. You're a real nut. You know that?" (Jerry gives him half of his sandwich to hopefully shut him up) I told you that God would never let me be successful. I never should've written that pilot. Now the show will be a big hit, we'll make millions of dollars, and I'll be dead. Dead Jerry. Because of this. (showing his lip)
(TO JERRY, SOMEWHAT IMPRESSED) A Red Chinese prison?
Sorry. I'll just go back to my usual routine.
I got a date with Karen. I don't know what I'm gonna do. Nothing happening down there.
What, you are comparing me to Biff Loman, very encouraging. The biggest loser in history of American literature.
I told you, I told you! Ha ha ha! Ooh ooh!
I can't do this! I can't do it. I have tried. I'm here. It's impossible.
All right, let's--let's focus. Can we get back to the plan?
Yes. You know the uh flood, and the uh lepers, and the commandments and all that.
So, where you gonna stick this (points to the Fusilli Jerry)
Anyway, right in the middle, the ship blows up-- burning debris, bodies falling-- and then just as this eerie silence settles over the airfield, I yelled out, "That's gotta hurt!"
I don't see why's she more self-conscious about that than her toe thumbs.
She put them in her pocketbook. I guess she took them with her.
(interrupts her) You know what. I don't think I'm going to be able to stay over tonight.
The last time I saw her, she was naked.
If anybody should be getting more it's you.
This was supposed to be 'The summer of George'! The summer of George.
Hey, check this out. I gotta give out Christmas presents to everyone down at Kruger, so I'm pulling a Whatley. (Give a Christmas card to Jerry)
You can't - huhu, All right let's go.
(to the executives) Excuse me. Did you hire the Sunshine Carpet Cleaners?
Its a great thrill to meet you, Sir.
What if the pilot gets picked up and it becomes a series?
The Rogue's Wallet. That's where he kept his card, his dirty little secret. Short, devious, balding. his name was Costanza. He killed my mother.
Yes I look forward to many years of... looking at the triangles. Well, I'll ah, I'll wait for you outside.
What am I supposed to get, a bazooka?
Deeply in love. If you can't say anything bad about a relationship, you shouldn't say anything at all.
They want you to do a TV show?
(gets up and picks a mirror) Yes. Yes, it's white. Why it's white.
Bear with you! This is a parking lot PEOPLE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO GET
Yeah, You remember the, the little eh, bank book, there?
(Picking up the ketchup) What typical? Gimme typical. Gimme some typical.
Do you know the last time I wore this thing? Six years ago, when I made that toast at Bobby Leighton's wedding.
Then, the last person to leave is Wilhelm. He sees my car, he figures I'm burning the midnight oil. Between the two of them, they think I'm working an 18 hour day! (he stands there with his hands on his hips, a wide grin - laughing.)
(slightly worried) You know, I'm starting to get a little nervous about this lunch.
I need some water. I gotta get some water.
Yes. Very nice to have had her to mention... (starting to leave)
Wait, wait. Here me out. Don't dismiss this. You're very quick to dismiss. Don't dismiss. She's got a big crush on David Letterman, I mean, a big crush. She talks about him all the time. Suppose I go up to David Letterman. He works at NBC; I work at NBC. I explain my situation. He agrees to meet her. They go out, they fall madly in love. And she dumps me for David Letterman.
S'cuse me ..Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?
First time in my life I've ever gotten back at someone.
Kramer, trust me, this is the best bathroom in midtown!
Ah, no, no. Are you sure? A girlfriend?
I mean, big would even be ok, a little beyond big.
Just when I was doing great. I told you God wouldn't let me be successful.
Ah, ...A beautiful successful intelligent woman's in love with me and I throw it all away. uh oh boy. Now I'll spend the rest of my life living alone. I'll sit in my disgusting little apartment watching basketball games, eating Chinese take out. Walking around with no underwear. Because I'm too lazy to do a laundry.
Really? I never heard of a semi (the "i" sounds like an "e") tractor-trailer. (Jerry nods in agreement)
All right we got the wine. Aren't we lucky? We got wine. Whoopee Whoa! Imagine if we didn't bring the wine. We'd be shunned by society. Outcasts! WHERE'S YOUR WINE? GET OUT!
The next morning, I woke up, and it was going like this. (moves his arm slowly) I can control it if I really concentrate. But otherwise, (arm moves) oh.
Yes. She's got great skin - a rosy glow..
Wait a second. 'Little places to go, where they never close.' What's a little place that never closes?
Well, I was very comfortable! I've got my nuts here...
Of course he is. There's got to be houses for rent in Tuscany. Do you know how big Tuscany is?
There is no problem. . . just a small miscommunication. Whereby you thanked her instead of the person actually responsible for purchasing the big salad.
Eh, I can't. I gotta go down to the foundation. I'm interviewing high schoolers for the Susan Ross.. scholarship.
He's actually doing him a favor. It's less money for him to buy food.
There's gotta be more to life than this. What gives you pleasure?
Well, it's a good looking piece of meat. (laughs nervously) Wow, this is some place. A duplex, huh? (indicating) Look at this, you got stairs in an apartment. All my life, I dreamed about having steps in an apartment. Even one step. Sunken living room. Although, one step is really not all that sunken. (tries hard to elicit a laugh)
I can't believe you're hoarding sex moves. I'm out there rubbing two sticks together. You walk around with a zippo.
You know it's a public phone, you're not supposed to just chit-chat.
So all right I'll speak to you through Jerry and everything.
(Hands still out, even though they've stopped looking at them) What happened to him?
Why not? Pay is good. I got dental, private access to one of the great handicapped toilets in the city.
He can be pedantic. He can be pedantic.
Only if you buy. I gotta make a sale.
If you go now, I know what's gonna happen. We'll find the car, Jerry will show up, and then we'll never find you.
Jerry, unless I pull down on this statuette and a hidden wall opens up, we have checked every square inch of this apartment!
Jerry, I can't. It's like saying to Pavorotti, "Teach me to sing like you."
Well, they get very hot in the polyester. You know, it's not a natural fibre. I think they would prefer cotton.
Jody let's do this agian real soon (he tends his arms for a hug but she avoids him)
Well, what is that? That's a crime! Do you know how hot those things get? They should be wearing cotton.
George, don't make me get tough with you. Whu, hu, hu, hu huuuu (raises arms) Who says that? She is really cool. What do you think? You think she likes me?
Cause I tell you, frankly, I would like to walk in hear one day and find you sitting down. (Starts to walk out of the store) That would give me a lot of pleasure. Call me crazy.
So is it all over between you and... Marsha Mason?
You're very good. Very good with the moanings and the gyrations. Y-You really had me going there for a minute.
Yeah, I told her to call me here and to tell anyone who answers the phone to ask for a balding, stocky man with glasses. I better tell him I'm expecting a call.
Of course not. I mean sure, there may have been one or two occasions in the past, when I may have reacted in uh impulsive or somewhat immature manner, but those days are well behind me.
(melancholy) I wish that was all needed. Life can be so confusing. I..I'm searching for answers, anywhere.
(standing up) I'm just gonna go to the bathroom.
When you're talking about a movie like "Beaches", moving from the chair to the couch , . . . that's quite a voyage.
I am not! What you call wasting, I call living! I'm living my life!
I'm not gonna be nice. That's how I got the job.
A woman that hates me this much comes along once in a lifetime.
I know. I know. That's what I do. That's what I do.
Well, I do what I can. (Robin comes over.)
You know, you have to know how to do that. You cant have people shoving their arms into a six-hundred degree oven!
You see? We were made for each other. (Thinking to himself) It's amazing. If I reach out and touch her breast right not, she'd scream and throw me out of the car. But at this time tomorrow, I could touch it all I want.
Hmm. What about a hole? You ever put anybody in "the box"?
(leaving) Alright that's it for me. Good night everybody.
Somebody double parked and blocked us in. D-DOES ANYBODY KNOW WHOSE CAR THAT IS? Maybe there's a note on it. Ohh-oh brother. No, no note. Can you believe this?
Hey, a "hit" is a totally different story.
(cheerful) Alright, there you go. She's gonna get the jacket back. (claps hands) So, let's go get some coffee, huh?
Yeah, it's me sir. It's been a harrowing few days. uuh,After the car accident, I-I crawled into a ditch, and managed to survive on, grubs and puddle water, until a kindly old gentleman picked me up.
She must have seen me eating it on TV.
No, Can't be...For instance I remember when we first met, we had a great conversation.
An' wait'll you see the dress that she's got. It's backless! Uh?! I'm finally gonna make a Great Entrance!
Care? Forget about care. Love. They have to love the characters. Otherwise, why would they keep tuning in?
I am eating my dessert. How do you eat it, with your hands?
And then, (Smacks the money) there were two.
Jerry, figure this out. I'm in the coffee shop, and this beautiful girl I could never even talk to, mistakes me for her boyfriend.
(adamant) Ah, c'mon! I'm telling you, I can coach for the NFL. It's not that hard
So you're a lawyer. What kind of cases do you handle?
Hey, what's another million, give or take. I get off where and when I wanna get off.
Wait, wait wait, not so fast. Jerry, you gotta take me to get this thing refinished.
I said, would you like to go for a walk or something.
Well, I'm sorry, Timmy...but I don't dip that way. (takes a chip.)
I've had bedroom naked, I've had walk-to-the-bathroom naked... I have never had living-room naked.
You know what, bad mistake my mistake do me a favor go back to the other lane - you'll never get there - forget this lane - y'a kn ow what this lane stinks - go back to the other lane - bad decision - go go go take this light - take this light -
Does she care? No. Does anyone ever display the slightest sensitivity over the problems of a fellow individual? No. No. A resounding no!
You think it's contact? It has to be touched?
" That guy was amazing, he could dunk and he was my height...What was his name again?"
Well, after dinner last week, she invites me back to her apartment.
No, not nice. She's stickin' it to me.
Well, does he wear bland, drab, olive colored clothing?
Hey, I'm his nephew, all right? Don't worry about it. Go ahead. Check it out.
(resentfully dampened) It's not a prom. It's a Ball.
Why? Maybe she liked me. I, I mean she was looking right at me. You know, I think she was impressed. You know, we had good eye contact the whole meeting.
Oh, come on! You gotta get me over there!
I'm trying to get out of this Big Brother program. So when you get to Paris (handing Morty the postcards) all you have to do is drop 'em in any mailbox.
Yes and I was hoping ... to get a thirteen week extension.
(putting the car in reverse) Oh beautiful! Look at that, the dream space right in front of Jerry's building. Huh? Dreams can come true, what did I tell you?
You know, if it was a regular salad I wouldn't have said anything. But you had to have the BIG SALAD.
Oh right, right! The blue sweatpants! Gees, it's too bad you can't say anything because of Angela.
Oh, no, thanks. I cant drink coffee late at night, it keeps me up.
Alrighty. Ah ... my last job was in publishing ... I uh got fired for having sex in my office with the cleaning woman.
What's going on? He still wants to have dinner with us?
(pops his head out of the covers, looking a bit confused) Uh...you know, uh...pleasuring you.
Reprogram all the buttons, see if he changes them back. You know? The old switcheroo.
She knows there is nothing to talk about.
(Takes two oven mitts from his back pack) Alright, (puts them on) I gotta get going.
No, I don't know. How do I know the usual?
This must be Sheila from the photo place.
....But after that we really talked didn't we?
Thats my candy line-up! Where are all my cards?! Theyre - theyre all on the floor!
Kramer, Kramer's not here...I knew it. I knew it! I knew this would happen. (SCREAMING) Kramer! Kramer!
Hey, did you see that whale thing on TV last night?
(animated) Are you insane? Jerk store, woulda smoked that guy! Smoked him, I say.
Why'd you pick Hoover? Was he that interesting to talk to?
(animated) You're letting him have a woman over?!
Ewings hurt? How long is he going to be out?
Oh, my god that's Saddam Hussein. The dictator.
Wow! Heh. (Half kidding) You don't, huh, have a replacement lined up for me, do ya? heh he he he he he...
(claps hands triumphantly) We might have an 'it'!
Oh, I found him. He was sitting on the steps of the library. I sat down next to him. He smelled like the locker room after that game against Erasmus
Donna. Oh, youre the one that likes that commercial!
You know, about the uh, two of us getting together. And I know that I said I was engaged, but (laughs) uh, you know, it's really just something you say. It's like, going steady. You know uh, going steady, engaged, it's, it's all just stuff you say. (chuckles) Anyway, I was watching uh, My Cousin Vinnie, on the uh, on the tape the other day, and I was thinking that uh, you know, the two of us might take a meeting, as they say. (chuckles) So, what d'you, what d'you think?
No, I decided to go with an '89 LeBaron.
No come on, let me, let me. I smashed your car, it cost you over two thousand dollars,
You're Murphy!! Look, let's just jump out of the car.
(Looking at her nose) Is your nose pierced?
When are you going on your next date with her?
Nougat? Please. I think Ive reached the point in my life where I can tell the difference between nougat and cookie. So lets not just say things that we both know are obvious fabrications.
Alright, now you're gonna see some parallel parking. (spitting into his hands and rubbing them together) How I wish you could make a living parallel parking. (turning around in his seat) It's all geometry, knowing all the angles, when to make that first turn and then when to swing it back in, that's the key.
You know, I can't remember the last time I called a woman without being nervous. I, usually, I'm pacing all over the room, I'm...
Hey, Mr Seinfeld. (shakes Morty's hand) Hey, Mrs Seinfeld. How are you?
(laughing) You think you're going to the other side with "Hi"? You're not going to make it.
I've got to tell you, I'm really disappointed in Lupe.
Yes I'd like to speak to Marisa Tomei, please? Marisa, Hi it's George Costanza.. I'm the short, funny, quirky bald man you met a little while ago, heh! yeah I was just calling 'cos I wanted you to know that I'm not engaged anymore......well huh, She died....Toxic glue from the wedding invitations.....well we were expecting about two hundred people. Yeah... Anyway.. hum I got the funeral tomorrow but huh.. my weekend is pretty wide open and I was wondering... (dial tone interrupts George)..... Hello...Hello..
Yeah, they're all through ruining my life. What the hell are they still doing here? Lemme see this pamphlet. Hm. All right, so I'll, uh, get back to you.
That was a hell of a thing when Spock died...
(Quickly making it up) Well, possibly. I wrote an off-Broadway show, "La Cocina." ..Actually, it was off-off-Broadway. It was a comedy about a Mexican chef.
You told her? How could you tell her? I told you not to say anything.
Kramer, listen to me. I'm never gonna have a child. If I lose this Frogger high score, that's it for me.
This is a *great* idea! Here... use this one. I get frequent flyer miles with every purchase... Wait! Get two tickets. As long as your turning it in for a refund what's the difference? I'll get *double* the bonus miles.
Ohh.. Paco! (Flicks rubber band tward the kitchen) Hey, take a look at this. (Hands Jerry Kruger's check)
You know, I got this little swelling right here. (rolls up his sleeve to expose his wrist) It's kinda painful. What d'you make of it?
I did. I'm back. I love this relationship, I feel so liberated!
I don't see how I could perform sexually in a situation after something like that. I was completely emasculated. Anyway, it's not the only reason.
Her roommate. I've driven women to lesbianism before but never to a mental institution.
I think we got a bite on it. (Exits)
Because I'm REFRESHED. I finally found a way to sleep in my office. Under the desk. I lie on my back. I tuck in the chair. I'm invisible.
What ever they had. Miranda thinks I'm a butcher but i-i-it's not my fault is it? Don't we have a deal with the pigeons?
(contemptuously, imitating Altons voice) Hes in the bathroom.
Well, whoever he was, he knew a lot about The A-Team!
Did I tell you I ran into her last week? Ho-ho, she looked great.
I believe the doors on the bathroom stalls, here at the stadium, don't offer much by way of privacy. But I was thinking if we extend the doors all the way to the floors......
(proffering glasses) I hope prune juice is alright. It's the only thing I had that was chilled.
Come on 'Oh George, oh Geeeooorge!' Come on! Not that I don't appreciate the effort that was put into it.
Like a "Hey your mother is uglier than Hazel. Hazel really puts your mother to shame"
Jerry, can I talk to you for a second? (They enter Jerry's apartment)
(worked up) I can't have a cup of coffee with a person?! I'm not allowed to have coffee?!
It's not that I want to keep talking about it? just think that the subject should resolve itself based on its own momentum.
No, listen; we are always sitting here, I am always helping you with your girl problems and you are helping me with my girl problems. Where do we end up?
...So, anyway, if you think about it, manure is not really that bad a word. I mean, it's 'newer', which is good, and a 'ma' in front of it, which is also good. Ma-newer , right?
Alright. I guess I just have to pick myself up, dust myself off, and throw myself right back down again!
(Makes a gesture saying he understands. The man nods) But how.. uh..?
You know, it's a miracle you're not married. (beat) Hey, I'm not obligated to buy anything, am I?
All right. So, what theatre you wanna go to tonight? We got 61st and 3rd or 84th and Broadway.
Y'know people, we got a situation over here!
I'm the bad boy. I've never been the bad boy.
Great! (snaps fingers and grabs the extra plane ticket) Nina could go, huh? Jerry, this is great. You and Elaine. Me and Nina.
I dont know. Just start scratching. Tell him you have the crabs. He was in the military. Hell understand that.
Well, if he can regift, why can't you degift?
I told you, he probably went out the back.
(confessing) Well, actually, I thought it up on the way over here.
I'm the opposite of every guy you've ever met.
Well, you see, what happened was...the doctor - the very same doctor that was attending to my late aunt - suffered an untimely stroke, and lost the use of his right hand, so...obviously I was unable to get the death certificate. However, I do have this. (Reaches inside his coat and takes out a Polaroid photo.)
uh Tony? there's not gonna be too many sandwiches
Oh, no, Sir. Festivus is all too real. And.. I could prove it - if I had to.
Let me ask you something. Could you tell if teeth marks on someone's arm matched teeth marks on a pencil?
So, she fell, and then she started screaming, "My back! My back!" So, I picked her up and took her to the hospital.
You open the door to the car, boom, you walk right into the hospital. Eh, You can't beat that spot. (starts doing a little dance) I am on a roll. I'm just willing these great parking spots.
Well, let's just say it wouldn't exist without me. (Notices another person in the library dressed the same as Celia.) So you two uh, shop at the same store, (hu)?
Well I didnt do it for my mother.
Excuse me, uh, what are you doing in there?
The sea was angry that day my friends like an old man trying to send back soup in a deli!
But I mean look at him. He's gotta be on his feet like that all day? That's brutal. I think I'm gonna say something to your uncle.
I always look annoyed. Yeah, when you look annoyed all the time, people think that you're busy. Think about it... (acts annoyed for 3 seconds).
Lloyd Braun? What d'you have to meet him for?
You gotta look at this. I pulled it in perfectly equidistant from the car in front of me and the car behind me.
Oh ya, like there's something wrong with saying 'God bless you'. I was raised to say 'God bless you'.
Well, she didn't BUY the big salad. I bought the big salad.
Beautiful women. You know they could get away with murder. You never she any of them lift anything over three pounds. They get whatever they want whenever they want it. You can't stop them.
I can't get a massage from a man.
You can see the Cayman Islands in there? Is something going to happen to me? What?
YES! It Blows Up! If you knew that, what did you tell Elaine for?
One mile from the exit it starts shaking, really violently shaking, like it's having a nervous breakdown. It completely stopped dead.
I saw them making out, you can believe it.
You know, Ive been thinking. I cannot envision any circumstances in which Ill ever have the opportunity to have sex again. Hows it gonna happen? I just dont see how it could occur.
Id like to have a kid. Of course, you have to have a date first... Remember my friend, Adam, from Detroit?
Y'know, the funny thing is, somehow I find her more appealing now... It's like if I knew she was a lesbian when we went out, I never would've broken up with her.
Morgan? No. He's doing a great job. (winks)
But enough about fish, huhuhu. I can discuss other things you know, ah architecture. Huhu. (makes a wide gesture with his arms)
She treated me to the Arabian mocha java.
(pulls a face) I find it disorienting. Who buys an umbrella anyway? Y..you get 'em for free in the coffee shop in the metal cans.
You said you grabbed it outta there real fast, right?
I'll pay you for your time....I just ..I just need some information . How much do you want? ten....fifteen? You have change for twenty?
Oh really. You tell her you shaved it?
Seemingly. Seemingly, to the untrained eye, I can fully understand how you got that impression. What looked like pushing...what looked like knocking down...was a safety precaution! In a fire, you stay close to the ground, am I right? And when I ran out that door, I was not leaving anyone behind! Oh, quite the contrary! I risked my life making sure that exit was clear. Any other questions?
Alright! Please, please! I cannot have this constant bickering!.. Stress is very damaging to the epidermis! Now, I have an important photo session in the morning - my hands have got to be in tip-top shape, so please - keep the television down, and the conversation to a minimum.
Just one? I'm living like twenty. (chuckles) What's yours?
Wow! I didn't try that 'til I was 23.
"What day is today?....Aw. ..Tuesday! Damn it. I shouldn't have worked out today. Mr Wilhem has called a big meeting and now I'm gonna be sweating through the whole thing."
So? For a twenty-five dollar cleaning, I can listen to some pointless blather.
Anyway it's kind of a fluke thing but uh I'll be leaving for Paris in two days. I will send you a postcard when I get there.
(quieter desperation) They took my belt, Jerry. I got nothing to hold my pants up. (listens) Well, you gotta come over here now! Just tell 'em what we talked about, how I, how I, I didn't do the project.
Well, why don't *you* go, and I could save the seats. You said you didn't like saving anyway.
(answering the phone while walking away) Joe Mayo's apartment?
"It's the Kom Pau ... George likes his chicken spicy."
You tell that son of a bitch no Yankee is ever comin' to Houston. Not as long as you bastards are running things.
(to Elaine) He asked you to get the mail?
Oh, Noooo, I'm so sorry. It's the MOOPS. The correct answer is, The MOOPS.
And get a picture of him, with his shirt off.
Oh, no, not just me, the whole organization. Especially Mr. Morgan.
Hey, I've eaten frogs, so nobody's perfect. Anyway-
All right, I gotta get going. My parents are expecting me.
Exactly! You know how they get animals to reproduce in captivity? They just put them in the same cage.
Please, it doesnt look good. Boy, boy, girl.
Did you see that? That-that pigeon didn't move! I had to swerve to get out of the way! I saved that pigeons life!
Whats seventy-five bucks?! What, am I seeing Sinatra in there?! Am I being entertained? I dont understand this. Im only paying half.
(disbelief) What?! They're stealing the name?! That's my name, I made it up!
Now I remember, as I jumped over the hole I heard a, like a jingling sound.
(rage) Oh, it's got cachet, baby! It's got cachet up the yin-yang!
Why does it always seem like I'm the only one working at this break-up?
Ha, ha ha uh, I'm not following that.
The guy who pitched him the show with the stories about nothing. (snaps fingers) Jerry Seinfeld. Jerry Seinfeld's friend.
How much do you tip a chamber maid?
Yeah, well I uh got lots of other stuff to show you too. Wait till you see the plum job that I landed.
I mean, it's not fair. I've been going there for 7 years. She's been there 3 weeks.
Do you really think I'm wrong about this Wyck guy?
Does that mean I have to go too?
Hunh, pph (raises hands slightly, in amazement) How was it?
[to himself] Hey, whatd'ya know? Look at that! A *lesbian* sighting. Oh-ho! My lucky day. They're *so* fascinating. Why is that? Because they don't want us. You gotta respect that...
Yeah, you gotta do it classy (wipes his mouth to his sweater.)
She told me she wants-- (Pauses until a woman coming down the stairs passes) She told me she wants me to make love to her.
What is with this dog, I thought we were taking it to the pound.
Look...humm..I'm on with Beijing with the hair restauration clinic. Could you talk to them for me and tell them I'd like to place an order.
I told her we'd all go out afterwards, okay? And don't applaud when she stops playing the first time. It's not over yet.
Yeah. Hey, you know, I gotta go get these tomatoes. You wanna go for a ride?
(Losing it) does not imply transfer of ownership. Moe, Sol, or Lem is not gonna get away with this!
I heard the last guy got fired because his nose whislted.
I bent over backwards for that woman! Is it that thing I said about her sister?
Alright, now the play is tomorrow night. So do you want to have dinner first, or do you just want to meet at the theatre?
I-I'm sure if you weren't satisfied you would probably say something wouldn't you?
I'd like to be able to get it out.
Yeah, I mentioned Simons. Next thing I know, Im in the parking lot. Perhaps they had some sort of a falling out. Ill tell you one thing. I dont know what hes got. But for a sick guy, hes very strong.
Guys, hitting is not about muscle. It's simple physics. Calculate the velocity, v, in relation to the trajectory, t, in which g, gravity, of course remains a constant. (Hits a home run) It's not complicated.
Not a plane crash. (leaving) Is it a plane crash?
(pleased with himself) You are having problems with your boyfriend and I am meeting you to discuss the situation.
And it's their anniversary Friday night. I could send them for a hansom cab ride. Y -- you think they'd like that?
So do I, but I wouldn't hang it on a wall.
No, I can't. She knows I go there. It's not secure. (the call waiting beeps) Hey, I got another call comin' in. I gotta let the machine get it. Bye. (hangs up)
I just don't like the idea that any time theres a dinner invitation there's this annoying little chore that goes along with it.
What am I talking about? Come on. (laughing) You don't think I bought all that? (does a little move)
It never ends, this present stuff! Engagement present! Then they get married, you gonna have to get them something for that! Then the baby, there's another present. Then the baby starts getting their presents. I don't even like Drake.
You know what? I think this Ruthie Cohen gave me the wrong change. Didn't I pay with a twenty? I'm sure I paid with a twenty.
It gets here when it gets here. Would you stop ridin' me?
I gotta go help her tape up all his boxes and get them ready for shipping.
I know, I hate it too. I feel like an out of work porn star.
I told her I would have to think about it.
(George, finger in the peanut butter jar) This is what I do.
Hey, hey, hey! Whats goin on here? (To Jerry) You didnt agree to anything, did ya?
(whispering) I can't explain. It's very important that I sit here.
Alright, alright, but no funny business, same deal as last night.
What's the difference? The money is not important.
(Getting up, he addresses Jerry) All right, remember no rust-proofing. Commit to nothing. If you have to speak - mumble.
When Lupe makes up the beds in the morning.
Of course. Your massage. (winks) Enjoy your massage. (winks)
(Reading the card from Whatley) "This holiday season a donation has been made in your name to the Children's Alliance."?
I'll call a plumber right now! (Goes for the phone.)
Don't you see how wrong that is?! Where's your Christmas spirit? And eye for an eye!
I got up, I was supposed to go to work, I came here instead.
Would you mind helping me out with some of this stuff?!?
(on phone, as Jerry gestures beside him) No, Lindsay, it was not IN the garbage. It was above the garbage. Hovering. Like an angel. Of course I know your aunt bit it. I kissed her goodbye. Listen, can I tell you something else? In my family, we used to eat out of the garbage all the time. (Jerry makes a face) It was no big thing. That's right. Oh, okay. Buh-bye. (hangs up phone) I'm back in, she gave me a second chance.
No something is bunk and then you debunk it.
Nah, the cable's out. What's with you? You look dead.
Why? Did she say something to you about why she broke up with me?
Hey Elaine? Put me down for some of that art. 1,900 dollars worth.
I think I could be a philanthropist. a kick ass philanthropist! I would have all this money, and people would love me. Then they would come to me.. and beg! And if I felt like it, I would help them out. And then they would owe me big time! (Thinking to himself) .. First thing I'm gonna need is a driver..
Hey, look at this. This is the same massage chair we're gettin' for Joe Mayo, $60 cheaper.
You-you sure you never slept with her? (Jerry shakes his head 'no') Perfect.
Oh yeah, when are you gonna execute that plan?
...so mind you, at this point I'm only going out with her two or three weeks. So she goes out of town and she asks me to feed her cat. So at this time, there's a lot of stuff going on in my life and, uh, it slips my mind for a few days. Maybe a week. Not a week, five, six days.
Nevertheless.. I was wondering if you and your .friends are doing business here at the Jiffy Park.... You know ..hum What do you people call it? Turning tricks? Anyway I...I....found a condom in my car....and I'm not saying it's yours but.... I want to know if I should just change parking lots.
George! She said George? She remembered my name. (loudly -- to a passing waitress and the rest of the restaurant) Diane DeConn remembered my name. She was the "it" girl!
(smiling) Well, we're certainly glad that you could make it.
Oh, Hey, hey, hey! That's great! That's very nice. You know we've been waiting twenty minutes for you people?! What do you think, you're Mussolini?!
Well why don't you get a hold of it and change what you don't like.
Excuse me, sir, do you have the time?
I think that's what the back of closets are for.
Pull hair, Poke eyes, Groin stuff. Whatever I gotta do. (he opens a blue bottled beverage)
I like to stop at the duty free shop.
Well, this is the Jerry Seinfeld that only I know. I can't believe I just told you that.
Watch the arm! Tim, listen, we don't want to bother you, we know you're busy here.
I don't understand, how do these thieves start the car?
Still lookin'. It's pretty bad out there. What about you?
Okay. (Chewing) Thanks anyway. (Continues to chew as he exits)
Slippery Pete, Kramer tells me you are one hell of a rogue electrician. And shlomo, you're the best truck driver.
You wanna sell computers? I will show *you* how to sell computers! Hello, Mr. Farneman. You wanna buy a computer? No? Why not? All right, I see! Good answer! Thank you! (Lloyd rings his sale bell) Serenity now!
It's stuck on a piece of cloth here. I can't get the cloth out.
Oh No nonono I'm not a cop ...Heum... I work for the Yankees.
I was quoting him. Why would I be insulted? I'm never insulted. You could call me baldy, dump soup on my head. Nothing insults me.
Get up, get up, its her! Oh, the hell with this, Im scared to death, just walk away, its off, cancel everything, go!
I believe strongly in that as you know.
I know, I know, thats what they said.
(penny drops) Oh, uh, wait a minute, wait a minute. (snorts) Is this about money?
(To Jane) You know, when I was a kid, I once found a dollar and fifty cents in change on the bottom of the pool.
(excited) Ho ho! (gestures and steps towards bedroom but Loretta walks the other way to the couch)
You know Keith, what I've always wondered, with all these ball clubs flying around all season don't you think there would be a plane crash? ...
Ill tell you, if I was running for office I would ask for the death penalty for double-parkers. If this is allowed to go on this is not a society. THIS IS ANARCHY!
Is that the guy who likes fat women?
Alright, c'mon, scooch over. (Tries to squeeze into the corner seat of the couch and struggles with Remy. He spills his glass of grape juice all over the couch in the process.)
[furious] Good. It's good to be accurate like that.
It's a huge problem, Jerry. The hardest part about having sex with a woman is getting her to come back to your place! He's already got that.
Well, it worked when I met George Peppard last week.
No I, I want it if you dont want it.
Oh, thats great. Thats great. By the way I have to apologize for my friend the other day. Friend? Uh, uh I dont even know that woman. I met her on the bus on the way over. I couldnt get rid of her. Uh, My psychic instincts were a little off ..
Someone's have to unhook the boat before it leaves...the place!
"'Cause when he questioned me about it I was sweating from the Kom Pau.."
The Chinese have done it my friend. The Chinese have done it.
Alright, lets get in there. Quick, quick, quick...
Pamela?! Awright, I tell you what. You look like nice people, I'm gonna help you out. You want a beautiful name? Soda.
I know what you're going through. Women. Who knows what they want?
I don't care. Look, Lloyd doesn't know what he's up against. This is nothing to me. (moving his arm) My whole life is a lie.
Excuse me, uh I couldn't help but notice that you were looking in my direction.
I- I'm pretty sure I left it eh, behind the cushion of the chair ... accidentally.
Can't you think of something. Call in a bomb threat.
You really think this looks O.K. on me?
You know, my arm feels a lot better. That Wendy really knows her stuff. (he writes out a cheque)
I've always liked her. Remember her in 'Carnal Knowledge'?
Yeah, he once bumped into reverend Yung Sun Moon.
So you think you can put the suit aside and hold it for me?
Oh leave Jack alone. Jack's got enough problems. I'll just take the small office.
(adamant) Yes I am. I defy you to come up with a better name than Seven.
The only thing that bothers me is that I'm just coming up with this now.
Yeah. And since you go buy there everyday. I was hoping that we could help each other out.
Hey. Hey. Answer me! Come on, show yourselves!
No, Kramer. I have to have this statue.
There was a box of raisins on the coffee table. Did you, by any chance, take them with you when left?
You are aware that Pensky is interested in me.
Don't you see. Women like that are like, members of a secret tribe living in a forbidden city. People like me have not been inside in thousands of years.. But with this, it's like I've already been with one of her own! My hands been stamped! I come and go as I please!
Just need to uh, to dig 'em up.
Well it's not my fault. Seinfeld can't drive. How hard is it to follow somebody?
OK, ah.. (George throws his keys on the table) see ya!
I'm really serious. I think that's a good idea.
Told me to "Go to hell!" and I took the bus home.
(getting animated) Look I, I uh, I had nothing to do with this. It wasn't my decision. It was Jerry! Jerry told me no. I'm the creative guy. He handles the business end.
You mean just walk into the staff meeting on Monday morning like it never happened?
What did you do here? You took out the wrong guy.
...and the Jews steal our money through their Zionist occupied government and use the black man to bring drugs into our oppressed white minority communities.
Mon...? No, no, I can't wait til Monday, that's impossible, I gotta talk to him now. Where does he live?
Just..go back. Pretend the whole thing never happened.
Well, I think Poppie's got some problems. There's a whole other thing going on with Poppie. So how did you leave it?
Why shave every day? It just grows right back.
I have tell you, I'm pretty impressed with the first one.
Awright, lemme just say this. Ten thousand dollars, alright, and now I'm going below what you wanted to pay. You have your dinner, have your veal, or whatever it is. Enjoy...
Jerry, I like being with her. Plus, I know where she is all the time. I have relatively no competition. An-and you know how you live in fear of the pop-in?
Well, Jerry's car gets hit and the other driver doesn't have any insurance, so the judge
What was wrong with that? I had a different interpretation! Do you know anything about this pretzel guy?! Maybe he's been in the bar a really long time and he's really depressed because he has no job and no woman and he's parking cars for a living! (out the window to honking cars) Alright! Alright! Shut up! Shut up! I hear you! I'm coming down! These pretzels are making me thirsty!
All right. There's nothing to be worried about. She's just a little annoyed right now. Tomorrow I'll personally go over there. I'll apologize. I'll get the papers. Don't worry. Don't worry. (exits)
(Reading) I see here that you play the harp.. tell me, why do you have to tilt it? Can't you just build it on an angle? It'd save you a lot of trouble.
(to Jerry, as Jerry nods in agreement) You know I think she might have something there.
Well, of course they're trying to screw you. What do you think? That's what they do. They can make up anything. Nobody knows. "By the way, you need a new Johnson rod in there." "Oh, a Johnson rod. Yeah, well, you better put one of those on."
(checking the fridge) No Chinese leftovers. George is gettin' suspicious.
Your clothes smell just like Pisano's. There's another Italian place on Jerome. Maybe I can fool him.
Ahh, Steinbrenner gave 'em to us, in honour of Phil Rizzuto being inducted into the Hall of Fame.
Actually, I never had any formal training. I guess I'd be better suited for improvs, or something..
(Persistent) Perhaps you could look again, please? Im very hungry.
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I used to come here all the time with my fiance, back when it was a meat-packing plant. Ha. Here's her picture. (hands her a magazine page)
Oh yeah! Middle finger, straight up, at me! At us!
Oh, you lying little snot. And he's a cheater. Aren't ya' you little twerp?
You know, suddenly I'm in the mood for pasta primavera myself. (Jerry nudges George to sneak a peek at Molly's cleavage as she bends over and looks in her backpack. Jerry has a quick look, but George stares, hypnotized. Russell comes up behind George.)
Shouldn't we at least drop off your bag?
Students cant clean. Its anathema. (explaining) They dont like it.
... She's got it stashed away in there somewhere.
(agitated) Well, I, I couldn't come. I, I had to drive my mother to, to the chiropodist.
I didn't burn it down - Kramer did!
You don't understand. He's got this big party coming up. He's been looking forward to this for months. This is gonna destroy the whole thing.
Yea, ya..ya know I feel terrible about Joey but it's jus..it's a great business opportunity. I-I don't even know how long I'm gonna be away for.
Hello! All right, we should be going. Come on...
Nah. It's all right. Great! She had a good time.
(Frantic) Kramer, do you know what those guys are gonna do to me?!
(Leaving) I'll store these over at Kramer's apartment.
Take it easy. Take it easy. It's not the end of the world.
Alright, still her father didn't have to throw me out like that, he could have just asked me to leave. The guy had me in a headlock! Susan's not going tonight you know.
I like sports. I could do something in sports.
What about the whole Christmas spirit thing? Any flexability there?
The show will be like a heart attack!
She wants to keep it quiet. She... thinks we have a real future together.
Nah, it's not a good turn. December. December. Don't you think we should have a little more time just to get to know each other a little.
I'm afraid I'm just not interested in how I present myself. If those kind of superficialities are important to you, this probably isn't gonna work.
(The damage has been done. He is slightly angered at Jerry) May I ask, what do you read in the bathroom?
I got engaged. I'm getting married. I asked Susan to marry me. We're getting married this Christmas.
Do you think it might be possible to add a little shelf like, uh, for an alarm clock?
You came to see me. I work in the building.
This friend of Susan's is staying with us for two weeks...Now am I wrong or is that excessive?
(MUMBLING) You come to a parking lot, you write it down. How hard is that?
You're an alcoholic! You have to apologize. Step Nine! Step Nine.
It took a couple of hours of convincing. I was persistent. I was just like those guys in the movies. And it worked! She said "Yes"! I can't believe my luck that she was still available . A beautiful woman like that. You think she's good looking, right?
He's got Marlon Brando's. I could go to Marlon Brando's house if I really wanted.
I see, well, thats open to interpretation. Because so much depends on the layering and the quality of the wetness in the eyes.
(Staring at the doll) This doll (Pointing) looks like my mother.
No, you just tell him ah, an old boyfriend has come back into your life.
Hey, by the way, if anybody wants an inside tour of the zoo, Siena works there as a trainer.
Not everybody knows what the crop circles are. (to the newsstand owner) Do you know what the crop circles are?
Then afterwards maybe we could all go out together. Y'know she'll see me with my friends, she'll observe me as I really am, as myself. Maybe I can get some hand that way.
Yeah, woman have no problem getting the hand off. How do they do that?
Parking in a handicap spot. Right in the middle of his United Volunteers meeting. When he got back, he chased after me with a baseball bat.
I don't know what the reason could be.
Oh, I dont get the enthusiastic hi, Im outta there.
(Inquiring about the chalk board) What is this?
I've tried. We don't have it. But maybe the two of us, working together at full capacity, could do the job of one normal man.
Jay Crespi, how am I gonna forget Jay Crespi?
That's no tragedy! How many people do you lose on a normal cruse? 30? 40?! Kramer, can I take a look at that book? (Starts walking tward the door. Kramer grabs his food, and follows)
What? Every time I leave my house now I have to call everybody I know and ask them if they want to do what I'm doing?
No. (dips the chip) You dip the way you want to dip...(bites the chip) I'll dip the way I want to dip. (dips the chip again.)
I told her I was out o' soda, I went out to get some, an' I never went back.
Did you dressed nice, did you do it classy?
(to Claire) Now, a woman calls me, all right?
If this lip reading thing works tonight do you know how incredible this is going to be? It's like having Superman for your friend.
Let me just say this. It is inhumane to make a man stand on his feet, in one spot for eight hours a day. Why shouldn't he have a chair?
I don't know of this is the house. I don't see Jerry's car anywhere.
Oh, I just, uh, leased a house out in the Hamptons, and I have got to get out there this weekend and sign the papers.
Wait a second, wait a second, what coming in, what woman is coming in?
Well, I think you're wrong about that. [Elaine walks past the window again, glancing in] And ah now if you'll excuse me, I'd really like to get started, please.
Youre a back-up, youre a second-line, a just-in-case, a B-plan, a contingency!
(anxious) I forgot who I am! Who am I?!
All right Mrs. S. I and my good pal Keith Hernandez will be right back.
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm terribly sorry.. (Bends down, and starts picking up her things)
I need a break, Jerry, you know. I gotta get out of the city. I feel so cramped...
I suppose I could just pull this out ( his tucked shirt)and walk around like this and you wouldn't care?
What, was that not politically correct? It's a legitimate question.
Anything, everything, something, nothing - Who the hell cares? Put me down. I'm down!
No, I, uh, um, wa, wa, What did I do? ... Where are you going?
Name tags! Name tags! What kind of an idiot thinks anybody would be interested in an idea like that.
Huh. Excuse me (to Ping) Hum... Do you speak chinese?
(quietly) That's uh, for the two of us.
He-he was uh touching and rubbing. (nervous laugh)
(reading the tabs) Jerry, yours is eleven dollars.
Yeah, Well that's a deal where I come from.
Exactly, but theyre on there  waiting. She said she cant wait to see me, were having dinner tonight. Shes supposed to call me as soon as she gets home.
Well you see he slipped, and he landed on a kinda of a..
Oh, I was uh, I was waiting downstairs for the jackhammer, thought I'd drop by.
(spits out mouthful of food) Mrs. Enright! Mrs. Enright!
If she doesnt show up, we cant possibly have dinner with him alone.
Wha - what happened? What are you doing back so soon?
So, you didn't think this was a date?
(Impersonating Carson) I didn't not know that. Weird. Wild. (Susan and George both laugh)
(looks back to the group) I can read lips. You said let's sleep together.
What, I can't stop by and visit my parents? (Drops pamphlet on coffee table)
Coulda fixed me up with Marisa Tomei. She said I was just her type!
Cops. I don't even care about cops. I wanna see more garbage men. It's much more important. All I wanna see are garbage trucks, garbage cans and garbage men. You're never gonna stop crime, we should at least be clean.
I think Play Now is putting something in my food.
You know, I can't talk to you anymore.
Oh. Ha. They are my keys, how weird. (laughs)
I mean, uh... I had fun ice skating.
This is what my life has come to... Tryin to meet a mute.
Of course. So, Im looking at it. I look up, I see shes looking at it. Our eyes lock. It was a horrible moment. I just..
Oh, its a lovely song. (singing) How do you solve a problem like Maria?...
I've been to a few of em. If you uh start to get woozy later, which is quite common, stay close to me. I'll get you through it. (chuckles)
How would you like a 'Hare Krishna' fist on your throat, you little punk?
So, just bring her here. This is all you really need.
(on phone, as Jerry gestures beside him) No, Lindsay, I had accidentally spilled coffee on the gentleman's windshield. Why would I do that? I have a job! Well, did she see a squeegee? Well, you're not going to make a dime without a squeegee. That's right, that's right, just tell your mother it was all a big misunderstanding. You won't regret it. Okay, I'll see you later. Buh-bye. (hangs up)
Yeah. I am like a drug dealer. I got the guy hooked. I am having lunch at his desk everyday this week. He doesn't make a move without me. It's very exciting.
Elaine said your pretty good at this stuff.
(worked up) Because if she gets it back, then you'll have no reason to be sour. You'll de-sour, right?
Oh, that's a dangerous fruit. It's like a weapon that thing, got spikes on the end. You can get killed from one of those things.
Yeah! She made me promise not to tell you .It's supposed to be a joke.
Yeah.( reaches for the purse and finds a piece of paper . he looks annoyed.
Let me tell you something about that tag. It's no 31, and uh...let's just leave it at that.
I told her. In the kitchen  which was risky cause its near all the knives. I started with the word Listen.
What about the body, what kind of body?
So... here I am. Ready to take you to the Hamptons.
I tried to be nice. I wasn't nice?
Come on. Come on. Come on. Yeah. Yeah. (grunting)
Severance package...The Yankees are giving me three months full pay for doing nothing.
Payroll project. Wilhelm? Big uh, big payroll project.
I didn't know whether to try and keep her from falling, or zip up.
After dark? Please. At their age, that's like swallowing stun grenades.
I take it off when I go to the, uh, y'know, to the "office".
Jerry, let me tell you something, "A man without hand is not a man." I got so much hand I'm coming out of my gloves. I got to thank Kramer.
Ah! Some bald thing, a bald thing I dunno. It's nothing
This is my ketchup. I bought this ketchup just so I could have as much as I want.
Yeah! That's how they talk. You know, everyone's either a bastard or a son of a bitch. Yeah, it's like uh..."boy, that son of a bitch Box can really hit, uh?!" (laughs)
(using the phone) Watch how it's done. Oh, hello, Mr. Vandelay? Would you like to buy a computer? Oh, really? Two dozen?
So I'm dressing and she's staring up at me, struggling to compute this unprecedented turn of events. I don't know what to say to reassure this woman, and worst of all, I don't have the time to say it. The only excuse she might possibly have accepted is if I told her I am in reality Batman, and I'm very sorry, I just saw the Bat-Signal. It took me 3 days of phone calls to get her to agree to see me again. Now she's waiting for me to call her, and she's
You're luscious. You're ravishing. I would give up red meat just to get a glimpse of you in a bra. Im terribly sorry. (both George and the attractive female applicant stand up as George reaches across the desk and shakes her hand for coming in)
Yeah, hell be looking at us like hes backstage at a puppet show.
It was more like a full bodied dry heave set to music.
Alright, alright, fine. (Gives the keys to Elaine.)
Is that so? Or could it be that you're just a *little* bit worried that you may have missed the boat?
(yelling) Awright, let's just stay calm here! Don't get all crazy on me!
(Muttering to himself as he walks to the bedroom) More stuff..
That?s-that?s-Harry Fong, he's a very good friend of mine and he's a big opera buff. Enjoy the show there harry!... You know what.
By the way, how did Puddy get back in the picture?
Look, I have my system. First I look for the dream spot right in front of the door, then I slowly expand out in concentric circles.
Yeah. No, no, no, wait a minute, I always have tuna on toast. Nothing's ever worked out for me with tuna on toast. I want the complete opposite of on toast. Chicken salad, on rye, un-toasted with a side of potato salad ... and a cup of tea. (laughs)
Hid? I have no idea how this suit got misplaced. Nevertheless, I do believe I shall purchase it.
(knocks) You hem... wanted to see me Mr. Steinbrenner?"
I saw Amy making out with your cousin Jeffrey.
I'm not going to break a hundred on this thing.
Its an incredible deal. I dont know why you dont come with me.
I love it. New office, new salary. I'm the new Wilhelm.
This is a brand new jacket. Boy this really burns me up, ...
Yeah, I'm a great quitter. It's one of the few things I do well. I come form a long line of quitters. My father was a quitter, my grandfather was a quitter... I was raised to give up.
Sorry I'm late, but look what I found in the Yankee Hall of Pride display case.
Busy. Don't give me busy. Who's not busy? I'm busy, we're all busy, everybody's busy. All right, tell me, what's kept you so busy?
You know, I could let it go for.. say.. a hundred and twenty-five.
(worried) Alright, alright. Look, we're people, you and me, huh? Businessmen. Colleagues, if I may. Let's not quibble. We'll do it for the thirteen thousand. Thirteen thousand, and I never came up here, we never talked, alright. You take good care. (moving past Russell toward the door) It was nice seeing you again, and nice meeting you. (to Cynthia) Cynthia, right?
(rising to his feet) Hey! Hey, you! (setting off after her) Come back here!! Don't gallop away!!
Okay, okay. Look, you do all the talking, okay?
Kramer, I, I, I, uh, I need to talk to Jerry privately.
Let me tell you who did, uh, buy it...um we pitched this story to Russell Dalrymple, the president of NBC, and he ate it up with a spoon.
Why don't we get them a couch? (Kramer laughs) Well rent a U-haul -- well bring em a nice sectional.
Sometimes at restaurants she talks to her food 'Ooh, Mr. Mashed Potatoes, you are sooo goood.'
I don't know, I like stuff you don't have to think about too much.
She kept such a nice clean apartment. She was so sanitary.
Oh yes, of course, and we have to be fair. (placing the suit further away in the rack)
I know, I know. Kind of a cute Nazi though.
( rubbing his eye) Ow, Ow you squirted me.
Yeah, but they let me go on and on all about the Hamptons, they never said a thing! You don't let somebody lie when they know you're lying. You call them a liar!
I was just wondering what it was you wanted for dessert.
I gotta try and find a way to switch places with him. It's like a Sigfried and Roy trick.
How much are we gonna get for this? Fifty, sixty thousand?
Yeah.. yeah, we're - we're cool. (Knocks lightly. Kramer takes charge by knocking on the door louder. The busboy answers) Uh, I'm sorry to bother you, I was in the restaurant earlier and I was wondering if I could talk to you for a few minutes about what happened. (He gestures for them to come in. They obey) I hope I'm not interrupting anything. It's just that I think I may have - without realizing it - been responsible for getting you fired. (Nervously laughs) And.. and.. and I just want you to know that I didn't intend for that to happen.
Yeah! Yeah!..Staten Island . What about my clothes ,how do I get the rest of the clothes?
Anyway, I don't even get a thank you. I don't get it!
Well, that pear shaped loser was me! And I was in that photo, until I broke in here, stole the photograph and airbrushed myself out of there!
I got a message from the Rosses at work today.
Ah, a, You know what, maybe I'll just come ... umm, yummm (stammering)
My whole life is ruined because of the (Mocking, bitter tone) "puffy shirt".
(Defensively loud) It was when I was banging!
Because before you know it he'll be having lunch with him. You know how these interoffice politics work.
What difference does it make what she looks like?
(Trying to keep his voice down) I think you've done a lot more than talk! You betrayed me!
Channel eleven? Forgive me for trying to class up this place, for trying to have the Yankees reach another strata of society that might not watch channel eleven.
And she loved me. Hoo, ho, she really did.
Give me two bucks. Ill do it for two bucks.
Well so what's the problem, you just put some newspaper down.
(laughs - hehe) Well, first, I'm brushing my teeth and this piece of apple-skin, that must have been lodged in there for days, comes loose.
Say it's Saturday night in Spain. They go out dancing. You think they do the flamenco?
Pay phone in L.A., look it's a miracle.
Give me your key, I gotta get it.
Well, aren't you the boss of him? You shouldn't let him move up! When I was in the Cub Scouts, I got stuck on Weebolos for three years 'cause I kept losing the Pinewood Derby.
Except for one small problem. Hah, I left some books in her apartment.
No, I'm gonna hold it under her nose so she can smell the scent of stale Bosco that I had to live with for three years, and I'm gonna say, "Remember this shirt, baby?! Well, now, it's payback time!"
Well, you really did it to me this time, Seinfeld. . . . What the hell happened here?
I can't tell ya now , he's gonna be back in a ten seconds.
Jiffy Park. It's incredible.. Seventy-five dollars a month.
I'm just happy to be working with your talented son...
You know, you could've just given me Neil's number. You..you didn't have to take me out to dinner.
You wanted a Yankee, I got you a Yankee.
(George puts on the headphones) Oh! my god...
Hi Beth (Scene Ends then re-begins with Beth and George on Beth's couch) Um anyway Jerry told me that uh.. it might have been my comment in the Coffee Shop that broke you up.
I know enough to stay away from it.
It's a very complicated move! I couldn't remember it all.
Oh, no no no. I was just looking for stock-pages. Here it is. Looking for the quotes. Gotta check to quotes. Love a good quote. Oh, IBM up a quarter.
Right. (Mumbles) Nastercoff.. What country is he from, again?
(holding his cane) I gotta hobble. (walks out)
Ah ha, Ah ha. You would, wouldn't you?
So what could I do? I couldn't go through with it. She threatened to kill herself.
A drafty apartment? A... sweaterless friend? A ball-game giveaway Metlife windbreaker?
If anyone should be forced to leave that place, it should be her!
Ive spent the last hour preparing ten candy bars with no wrappers or identification of any kind for him to select from.
Fitted Hat Day! That's what you asked Steinbrenner for?
Why, you think you can, beat me up?
I know what the problem is - I like her too much. That's why I can't make a move.
Oh - comfort, schmomfort. Listen, Father, can I ask you a question? In a terrible time like this...who would I get the death certificate from?
(Once again, still on the shower) Could it be lukewarm?
Tennis courts? W-w-what about the yard? Where do they have the gang fights?
So what, they don?t have another plane? She couldn't take a bus?
(he just took a bite of the Chinese food ) This is terrible. What is this, ginger? I hate ginger. I can't understand how anyone can eat ginger. (puts the container back in the refrigerator.)
I dont understand, you never talk to her about other women?
Remember that New Year's party he threw a few years ago? He had that very drafty apartment, you know, I think on Ninth Avenue.
Alright. Listen, I gotta get some reading done. You mind if I do this here? I can't concentrate in my apartment.
Well, Steven, I, uh.. (All the sudden, a small gang steps out of nowhere, surrounding George)
(Stuttering) I, I, I, .. here, let me - let me help you..
Aah, hey. (enthusiastic) If this works out, forget about it. Vacations together, movies together, dinner together. It..it's almost as good as if I didn't get married.
Alrighty, so. That's one tuck and one no-tuck. Got that?
Well, I wouldn't want you to do that. You know there's a lot of losers out there.
Do you hold the neck together with one hand, or are you just letting it flap in the breeze?
So, uh, gentlemen, do we have a deal?
OH!!!! What are you, crazy?! Are you, crazy?!
Yeah and you get this really cool T-shirt when you sign on..
Forget about smelling the car. Smell the valet. Go to the source...
I didn't get the special, but I'd also like the fresh fruit too.
Yeah, about ten, fifteen minutes. But I have to stop at a vegetable stand.
I don't think we should see each other anymore. You're great but I'm I'm riddled with personal problems.
What do you think? The brought it over in pieces and screwed it together like a coffee table?
Mulva! (again pointing finger at Jerry -- Kramer watches the exchange back and forth)
All right, let's postpone it. Let's get out of here.
W--then I'm pretty much where I am now. At least I got to take a ride on a spaceship.
For 50 bucks? I'd put my face in the soup and blow.
I can't come out. They're standing right by the door. Throw it up!
That's him over there. The one that looks like a blowfish.
Boy, my knuckles are still cramped from that football game.
All right, I'll tell them my sister died. (Starts fake crying) My poor sister died. She was standing and then she was laughing and then they SHOT her! That's the kind of sick city that we're livin' in. They shoot you for laughing. I must go and comfort my poor family. Jerry, take me home so I can comfort my... my poor family.
Well, wait a little while, Ma. What's the difference?
What are you looking at me like that for?
Did you happen to notice that Julie handed the big salad to Elaine?
What am I scared of? I'm scared of the same thing that you are, everything! Why don't you just use your own name?
Oh, okay. (Starts to walk other way and then walks to their room and goes in)
I, ... am breaking up with, ... you.
Well, last night she told me that she liked you. Not you, the disturbed you, so I had to tell her the truth.
O.k....(is about to explain. Cut to Jerry on-stage.)
Then I asked her if she wanted a drink.
Yeah, like he was really gonna take your money.
Maybe we could call them and ask them to return it.
(Letting his conscious get the best of him) I wonder how Susan's father's going to react to this. Alright, what- what's the worst he could do? So you burn a cabin down..
ho ho ho ho. You know I only got two weeks left of unemployment. I got to prove I've been looking for a job to get an extension
Well I've never met your sister but obviously these are not hard-and-fast rules. (to the waitress) Darling, the tea is getting a little cold sweetheart.
It was a fat camp. Those kids depended on me.
Okay. Now, why do I have to see (points) you?
You know, they say ostrich has less fat, but you eat more of it.
Allright, very good I'd like my car and my deposit back please
Alright. Uh, well, I'm out of here. (Gets up to leave)
Well, that interests me very much Mr. Farkus.Very much indeed, sir.
(spotting possible salvation) You know what, I urge you to take it up with him. Go ahead, give him a call, he'll tell you what I'm doing here. (half to himself) Then you can tell me.
It's not a pet! It's a wild invalid! And it knows that I tried to kill it. As soon as it gets better, it's gonna gnaw my brain out in my sleep!
Fifty bucks a month, that's incredible! Okay, thanks.
I'd argue if I could, Mrs. Enright. (exits) Here we go, all right.
(to Jerry) "You know those shoes that Jimmy had? I cut a deal with him. We're gonna import a case of them together."
Lunch is fine at the beginning then you move on to dinner. you don't move back to lunch. It's like being demoted. I'll never do another crossword puzzle with her again. I know it.
I like Christian rock. It's very positive. It's not like those real musicians who think they're so cool and hip.
Hey by the way my parents really want to have your parents over dinner before they leave town.
Hehehehehe (higher tone laugh, though still quietly )
Now Peterman wants me to go to the funeral.
(Slowly shakes his head) My mother caught me.
Oh, my God.. (Buries his face into his hands)
Wait a second. Think about it. He's not showing up. Wait till you see the line of cabs, its like forty-five minutes long. You said he's in Chicago.
Well I am actually going to have a secretary and I get to do the interview.
I have to talk to Elaine. This cleaing lady is turning the screws on me. She's pushing for this whole relationship thing. She keeps calling me, threatening to go to the boss with this thing, I could lose my job, I gotta do something to keep her quiet.
Maybe somebody did it and didn't take credit for it. Maybe it was already done and didn't need doing in the first place. I have no idea who did it, what they did, or how they did it so well. And you know what? Jimmy crack corn and I don't care.
(Sliding over to make room for her) Sit down. Join us, please.
(to Susan's stone) ...And then, right after the All-Star Break, we, we just swept the Orioles. Four games. In Baltimore. (adjusts necktie nervously) So... yeah.
Out? Oh no, I've been to four other places, you're the only ones that have had it.
(to Kramer) This man is a genius. Genius!
(smiling) Ho ho. Funny. Isn't he funny? Funny guy. Ha ha ha.
I think I can sum up the show for you with one word NOTHING.
(Fed up with his parents) Actually, I think I'm pretty clear on it.
Are there terrorists on the plane? A hotel fire. Is that it? Malaria? Yellow fever? Lupus? Is it Lupus?
I'm really going to do something with these three months.
It's worth a shot. (Goes to the door.)
[quite out loud, not even pretending to whisper] Elaine!
Well, I still think you shoulda told me.
So, you want to come down to Mario's Pizza with me and help me pick up the Frogger?
What? Oh I spilled some food on it.
With the orange hair, and the big clown shirt with the ruffles...
(Angered) Fine. I'll ask you again when you're rested.
(anger) Well now it's not gonna be original! It's gonna lose all its cachet!
Well, don't they make a counter offer? How can they just cancel the whole deal like that? What kind of a maniac is this guy? I mean he just, he says no, and that's it?
But I know who took the bite. It was her aunt!
(standing) Oh yeah, Reilly? (smugly) Well, the jerk store called. They're running outta you
I had to say something. (chuckles) I had to say something. Everything was going so well. I had to say something.
Well I I ..put a lot of thought into this and I think I would like you to sign a prenuptual agreement.
Yeah. She should be commending me for treating everyone like equals.
What the hell are you two talking about? (All exit)
You know Elaine, I'd do it but I'm working that day.
Oh, I understand. (George exits; Sees Kramer in the hallway) Hey.
I'm starving. We should have had lunch first..
I hate this mall, there are never any spaces here...
Alright, what are we getting? It's hot in here!
Hey listen... umm, instead of the movie... uh, maybe we'll go back and uh you know...(nudges her head with his head)
It's one think to not give me the extension But to tease and to torture me like this. There's no call for that.
(While skimming a Monk's menu) You know, I didn't go to the bathroom the entire time we were in India.
(irascible) Oh, I see. So your time is more valuable than mine. Is that it? You're a delicate genius!
(smug) Ah, I guess I showed Neil who's Neil.
Well, I took the liberty of packing your things. (gleeful) Mom's coming to get you.
You haven't won. You may think you've won, but you haven't won. Do you know why? It's not over. This is not over. I'm not forgetting what's happening here. You have my ten dollars. I will get it back. Alright, don't worry. It's not over. I'm going now. Good bye. I will be back.
I got a big problem here, Jerry. The tapes are worthless.
I know. It's Mickey Mantle's number. So not only is it an all around beautiful name, it is also a living tribute.
(Thomassoulo helps George get up) Yeah, what the hell.
We sat there for twenty minutes, chewing, staring at each other in a defunct relationship.
I cant believe I said that. You know me, Im a vault.
All right. So let me ask you a question. Who was the man in the cape?
(to Carrie) It's just that, I know her, and boy...
Well... we could dance around it a little first.
I don't know, maybe a safe fell on her head.
ahhhhh (exhaling) Jerry, my young friend, you're so nave. You are so, so nave. You know about a few things. You know about comedy, a little bit about relationships, some baseball, but you are so far out of your element here, you are embarrassing yourself. Now listen to me. I'm negotiating. Negotiation, this is what'cha do in business.
(Pleading) You gotta let me go over there.
The attic? Y-you haven't wore any of those clothes for years.
Did I get him in trouble? Because of what I said?! I just told him what happened.. he didn't do it on purpose.. (Mangager and busboy are arguing. The busboy points in the direction of George) He pointed at me. Why did he point at me?!
Yeah. A couple of people. I don't get that, though. Where do you start?
Ah, I guess I should go up and apologize.
I cant call her now. Its too soon. Im planning a Wednesday call.
Because Im not Latvian Orthodox. Her parents wont let her get involved with anyone who isnt Latvian Orthodox.
Got her machine. Im dead, Im a dead man. Thats it. Im dead, Im a dead man. Dead man.
Yeah, well...a little rough finding something good in your price-range. (to Jerry) But you, my friend, may be in luck.
Uh, heading out. Jerry really hates to miss the coming attractions.
What, ... you are making some wisecracks in a night club... wo wo wo. The guy was in game SIX two runs down two outs facing elimination.
But I digress. Let me see, now. You were standing at one end of the line and I was right next to you. And I remember we were even for like, the first five yards and then , BOOM,...You were gone.
How's her handshake? A little firm, isn't it? Maybe a little too firm?
I got it. You wanna get her something nice? How 'bout a music box?
I can't tell ya how much I appreciate this.
You idiots. You're gonna wear down the battery.
This is a crude mock-up of the conference room. 1/14th scale.
Yes, I like to just be able to take the blankets and swish them and swirl them, you know what I mean? You know, I don't like being all tucked in. I like to have a lot of room, you know I like to have my toes pointed up in the air. Just like to scrunch up the blankets.
...you'll see, things will be different now - if you just give me one more chance.
You know, a muffin can be very filling.
No, you're gonna sit down, you son of a gun...
Men have been popping into my sexual fantasies. All of a sudden I'll be, in the middle.
We could be zipping all over the place.
Hu-Yeah, interest. It's an amazing thing. You make money without doing anything...
So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified! But I pressed on -- and as I made my way passed the breakers a strange calm came over me. I-I don't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment  I was a Marine Biologist!
The *bank*? This is *found* money. I want to *parlay* it. I wanna make a big score!
I dont know how you put up with this.
All right, just gimme that. And gimme some of those Sweet & Lows.
Oh, the nose job. I don't know, what did you think?
That's like using a wheelchair for the fun of it!
Maybe I could move them until you get back.
Oh I was not. The BUBBLE BOY was tried to kill me.
Thank you very much. You just stand over there, I?ll stand over here.
It's a pot pourri. May I, uh, may I show you the master bedroom? (they leave together)
(on the answering machine) Jerry, what's happening? Come on, pick up the phone.
I know the D is the biggest. I've based my whole life on knowing that the D is the biggest.
Ya-see, how could this not have any fat? It's too good.
I'm cheap? You think I'm CHEAP? How could you say that to me? I can't believe this. How could you say that to me?
(oozing fake sincerity) Well, as much as I enjoy all the good-natured ribbing, nothing really makes me happier than spending money on the people I care about.
You don't think I can keep a secret?
Ah, Alright, before that, I was in real estate. I quit, because the boss wouldn't let me use his private bathroom. That was it.
Was she uh, was she a big, uh woman?
Jerry, would you do me a favor, close the window.
Oh, no no no. Course not. I got a great name for our kids. A real original. You wanna hear what it is? Huh, you ready?
Me Too! And he's Dying Jerry! If Relationship George walks through this door, he will Kill Independent George! A George, divided against itself, Cannot Stand!
(entering the apartment more fully) Oh. Oh, hi, hi. Hi. Nice to meet you. (peering at the table) What're you having, veal?
Geez, Hey you know something, you should try my friend's wake up service. She swears by this thing.
Oh, it was. But he claimed it was a 5th Avenue bar.
This is incredible! This is one of the greatest things I've ever done in my life! I'm gonna call my mother.
You don't understand. A garage. I can't even pull in there. It's like going to a prostitute. Why should I pay, when if I apply myself, maybe I could get it for free? (he hears a horn honking) What? What do you want? Go around me, I'm looking for spaces.
Well no not yet, you gotta buy french stamps (pauses) I-I'll reimburse you of course.
Yes, yes, I definitely waited. But let me say this Once he passes on that option, that 'God bless you' is up for grabs.
(laughs) Youd have to be a real loser to try something like that.
But now I have my own market research. Actual Japanese viewers, that love the show! I'm gonna talk to Kramer.
Oh with all due respect, I went there too, and I work for a team that just won the World Series.
Well, Jerry, I been thinkin'. I've gotten as far as I can go with George Costanza.
(looking uncomfortable) Um... yeah! Sure, sure I'm interested.
You know what, I'll just uh, I'll just look around for a little while. (moving to come round the counter) I'll just browse around.
Yes, for a sales position. Latex salesman, the selling of latex, and latex related products. They just wouldn't give me a chance.
I told I had a bus transfer that was only good just for another hour.
Yeah, I think I got a touch of something, too.
You know what? I changed my mind. I, uh, I don't think so.
Uh, nothing, lets get going. Come on. (laughs) hu hu.
You're my mother! What wouldn't I do for you?
So what? What am I supposed to do?
What, you think I'm going to repeat the whole thing now?
Well, you know, to be honest sir -- my, my new secretary Ade, came up with that one.
(Changing subject) Hey, I htink I may have found someone for the scholarship.
Well, there's going to be a lot of dentists there.
That's a tough minute. It's like waiting in the shower for the conditioner to work.
Well, I assume there's some sort of write-off.
Excuse me. I believe you just ate my Twix bar. It was dangling. And when you purchased your Twix bar, you got a little freebie, and you never bothered to ask why, or seek out its rightful owner.
You met her at the supermarket? How did you do that?
Jerry! Oh, my God! What are you doing!?!
(panicked and rushed) Jerry! The Japanese guys had sake in the hot-tub! You gotta get 'em outta the drawers and get 'em down here, or I don't have a focus group to sell the pilot to Japanese TV!
Well, you're gonna have to go to the bathroom!
You know what I would like to do? I would really like to have sex with a tall woman. I mean really tall. Like a like a giant Like six five.
You see those tears streaming down you don't know what to do. It was like she was on fire and I was trying to put her out.
Would you like a Pepto-Bismol? I keep them in my wallet...! (Russell goes into the bathroom and shuts the door.) (To Jerry) Do you think he liked it? (From the bathroom, we hear Russell violently heaving his guts.)
Divorce is very difficult. Especially on a kid.
I don't understand things were going so great. What happened? Something must have happened.
I have to rewind it first. (George presses the rewind button on the tape recorder. He and Jerry stand there, waiting impatiently as it rewinds.) Alright, alright.
A man gave me... a massage. hu, hu
So call her up and tell her to bring you another one. She'll be delighted to talk to you.
I got rejected by a bald woman. A bald woman rejected me. Heh, you like that one? A woman with no prospects and no *hair*, told me that I wasn't her type. Apparently *baldy* likes a slimmer guy.
You know, sometimes those guys don't make it back. (Looks in fridge) I'm really hungry.
Let me ask you this. If you stick your hand in the hair is it easy to get it out?
He mentioned my name?! What did he say?!
Hey, she wants me to dress uh "smart casual." What uh, what is that?
Well this worked out okay. So are you going to see the police woman?
Ahoy! Mr. Eldridge. I understand you were on the Andrea Doria.
So the plan is to secretly sterilise her mouth?
No, no that can happen. Ive, uh, Ive read about that in medical journals. Its a freak thing, but...
Well, I'm just expressing my gratitude to our gracious host.
Uh, Jerry, you want your blankets tucked in?
If only something like that could happen to me.
Yes! I mean, if she thinks that's me she's under a complete misapprehension. That was not me, Jerry. That was not me.
It's all your fault! You and Elaine! All that orgasm talk. She did have an orgasm, she didn't have an orgasm. Orgasm this, orgasm that. I got so focused on it. I started to panic and boom, I lost it. I tried everything, I was talking to him 'Please wake up, do something.'
Cancer? Is it cancer? Do I have cancer?
That's a lot of pressure. Make love to me. What am I, in the circus? What if I can't deliver?
I bought a new recliner with a fridge build right in to it.
Oh!, so what. I'd rather she hate me and thought I was good looking....At least I can get somebody else. (scratching his chest) What is this? Why am I itching?
Yeah, yeah, sure, Christmas. Snow. Santa. All that stuff.
40? I'm payin' 60 to my maid. She doesn't do laundry and I'm gettin' nothin'. All right. Once she pinched my ass, but I don't know what that was.
Hey could you do one other thing for me?
Great. (They both stand.) Oh, by the way, did you get a chance to read the script?
I got him Yankee's tickets! He got me a piece of paper saying "I've given your gift to someone else!"
Oh. Okay, here it is, I got it. She lost her thumbs in a tractor accident and they grafted her big toes on. They do it every day.
Specific, Ah, lets see. I've walked in and out of so many buildings they all .. blend in together, I uh, ..
I should probably get going too. If I don't feed Pequita by seven, she goes all over everything.. take it easy.
You're right. Why must there always be a problem? You'd think just once I could get a break. God knows I earned it with that score!
Say you go to the bathroom at two o'clock in the morning, what's the outfit? I mean, you dressing up or is it come as you are?
But it's not a photograph, I need a photograph!
He's on the lamb(?), he's on the loose!
Ah-Ha! (he turns and walks over to the refrigerator)
So, you were saying how, um...about the script...
No (snorts - Laughing nervously)... I'm gonna wear black shoes.
(laughing) Have something else. Cmon, have a little dessert?
At the funeral, give or take. You know, deep down, I always kinda felt that they blamed me for Susan's death.
(Still focused on the nudist) They're naked, the gardeners naked.. the bellhops. (Jerry makes a noise of astonishment) One big nude-a-rama.
It's just paper on a roll, that's it. And that's all it will ever be.
Hey, hey, hey! It's not Lupe's fault, you shouldn't have left it out.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. You can't say anything. (rushes to take phone from Jerry)
You know my last name is Costanza. That's Italian. So you and I are like country men. Pisano's!
Wait a minute. I must have been winking down at the office. That's why Mr. Wilhelm was acting so mysteriouso.
Shst, You should take the test for me.
Yeah. Thanks. Hey, listen, if you ever get a date, maybe the four of us could go out together sometime.
No, stings the throat. Anyway, so I was coming along here, and I felt like a piece of cake, you know? But then I thought, it's morning, I should really have a muffin. I like those chocolate chip ones. Then I figured, well, they're really both cake. So I, uh, I sat on that bench for a little while, twenty minutes or an hour, and then I figured, check and see what you were up to. (a thought occurs to him) Wait a minute, wait a minute. The broad jump! The broad jump over the pothole on Eighty-sixth Street!
I spilled some Chardonnay. So, what did you get?
A plane crash? A Heart attack? Lupus? Is it Lupus?
It was kinda fun. (Elaine gives Jerry a cold cloth for his jaw.) You know, maybe his name really is J-O-H-N, but he changed it to J-O-N for show business. Well, you know, J-O-N is a lot zippier.
Don't go. Kramer! Come back. I got great news. Well, I did it.
You know what I was just thinking -- she could really use a raise.
(taking it out of his jacket pocket) yeah I got some sandwiches.. I got tuna.. and salmon salad Tony because I know you don't like peanut butter
I mean, batteries have gone dead before, aren't they prepared for that?
(excited, pushing Jerry forward) All right, let's go, let's go, let's go, come on.
All right. I am happy, and I'll tell ya why -- because the two of you were making me and every one of your friends sick! Right, Elaine?
(coming back in) Alright, alright. Can we go out and eat?
Oh, well, so what? Laughter - what is that? I mean, what is the point of opening your mouth and going "Ha, ha!"? What is that? "Ha, ha!"?
Oh, no...no, that's very bad for the kidneys.
Yes, full. I love to be full ... love to sit back, loosen the old belt and digest away for hours. Let those enzymes do their work.
I, uh, should have a poem very soon now.
Wait. Whoa! That's the Rabbi from Elaine's building. I just met this guy the other day.
(pointedly to Elaine) Oh. Thanks very much for yesterday, by the way.
No. So, tonight she's got tickets for that show she's been working on. The Flying Sandos Brother.
No, you go Guggenheim. I'm not much of a Guggenheim.
So, they didn't give you a piece of cake? Big deal.
Look I need you to do me a favor. I need you to get me lunch at Pisano's.
Because I know him too, and probably a lot better than you.
Huh. You must think Im pretty stupid. (The mechanic shoots him a look as if he cleary does think hes stupid) That was no 5th Avenue bar. I can see the crumb right there in the corner of your lip! Now, that-that-that is a cookie - and we all know that Twix is the only candy bar with the cookie crunch.
Hehe. Well, I got my triangles. (sitting on the couch)
(Muttering out, not really wanting to talk about his family) When the Costanzas came here, one brother stayed behind.
These are not "scraps." These are historic remains of a once Great Society of Hair.
Uh, let me ask you something. You uh, you ever hear of Marisa Tomei?
All right. (throws his coat back down on the seat and sits down opposite them)
(Arms out) I am king of the county. You?
(to Elaine) Right, alright. (to Jerry) Oh Jerry, do you have any apples?
They all have swirling chocolate in the commercial!
uh.. maana? huh maana might.. huh maana might be a problem, I'm supposed to have huh a boil lanced maana. Huh you know I think they charge me if I cancel with only one maana's notice
It's right in the explosion scene. So if you could just...leave me a little window. You know, my, uh, my aunt had a thing removed with a laser. All right, I don't want to interrupt your meal, so...
Oh, uh, the cigars.. (Chuckles nervously) I'm, uh, suckin' 'em down. I'm puffing my brains out, yeah.
Don't look around. Don't look around. That's what he wants.
Anna actually has respect for me now. (laughs/snorts) It's all over.
THIS is your daughter? My God! My God! I I hope you don't mind my saying. She is breathtaking.
So we order lunch, and were talking. Finally, she blurts out how its not working.
Well, you should always consider podiatry. (Patting Ricky on the shoulder) There's nothing wrong with the feet. (Ricky looks critically back at George)
Yeah, let him chew on that for a while.
Hi, how are you guys? Listen, does either one of you have like a mint or piece of gum or...
So what have you been doing with yourself?
Every day she comes in, she sits at that table and reads. Never talks to anybody.
Wow. (he runs his fingers through his hair, and then brushes the resulting fallout off his jacket)
Oh Shut up! What are you doing back so soon, anyway? (puts the tape back in it's case.)
Oh, sure, my Black Hawks jacket. I love my Black Hawks jacket.
Yeah, I never know what's going on there.
I'm stuck. Pull a little, just a second. Don't start the train! Don't start the train!!
As you care for me. Which is why it is very important that you never breathe a word of this to anyone about the... you know. What, with Clarence Thomas and everything.
You want my friend to ask his uncle, a man who just lost his wife of 44 years, for a death certificate so that he can save a few bucks on a flight?
All right, listen, I'll see you guys later.
(walking back) Are you sure? 'Cause it could really help me out of a jam.
Well, I know when I'm a little strapped, I sometimes drop off my rent check having forgotten to sign it. That could buy us some time.
Yeah! like the big toe is like the captain of the toes, but sometimes the toe next to the big toe gets so big that there's like a power struggle and the second toe assumes control of the foot.
Elaine you don't understand. I had 103 temperature when I bought that sweater. I was so dizzy I was seeing red dots everywhere. I thought everything in the store had a red dot on it. I couldn't distinguish one red dot from another. I couldn't afford anything. I have nothing. I haven't worked for a really long time. (Jerry is standing right behind George. Jerry takes out a hankerchief and starts fake-crying in it.) I mean look, I have no clothes, look at what I'm wearing. It's just a little red dot.
Well take a look. It might not even belong to her.
Well I was dropping of the calzone money for the week.... Um shouldn't you be at work by now?
That's not how it happened. It's when he fell on him with his knee.
How could anybody be so selfish and inconsiderate!
There was nothing else on. Oh, the left arm.. the left arm.
(grunting) Hey! Hey, wait a second. I got an idea.
Really? (Realizes) Well, you don't think it had anything to do with what I said, do you?
Just because you have someone's spare keys, it doesn't entitle you to break into their apartment. That's the reason you took away Kramer's keys.
Well, it's a tough decision. I have to wear these every day. I'm deciding on a new face.
Sure. Thank you for coming in. (Tom eats some raisins)
My parents don't read! They're gonna wonder what a book is doing on the table!
25 kids for his birthday party? (to kid under table) Don't put your tongue on the floor! He's putting his tongue on the floor! Here, here, have some more sugar packets. (tosses some Equal packets under the table)
I could have had some ice cream. I think that might have calmed down the nachos.
But Kramer, isn't it a question of hygiene?
Ooooo, I'm scared. . . . Ohoooo they're not going to do the show.
Well, they hurt him bad. Really hurt his feelings. It's a long story. I- I don't like to talk about it, but I swore then that I would never work for big broker-houses. See, all they care about is money. I'm about more than money, I'm about people, always gone my own way and I've never looked back.
Elaine...let me just explain something to you. See, this is not just a weekend routine...I'm on the verge of make-up sex here. You know about make-up sex?
Oh, no, no...condoms are for single men. The day that we got engaged, I said goodbye to the condom forever.
You can't just walk into a building and say " I wanna be a talk show host."
Oh, no no no no. Go ahead, Pop, you always knew your cars.
(outside, looking the guy trying the suit through the window, and thinking out loud) What's this? Can't I leave this place for a second? (goes in, take off his jacket, walks to the guy and talks to him with an european accent) Can I help you?
We talked about his new batting stance, you know, I'm not crazy about it, but I said , 'Donny, go with it 'till it stops workin'.' Donny baseball. He's a helluva guy.
If I didnt put that floss in my pocket, Id be crawling around her bedroom right now looking for my glasses.
(broaching a subject) Hey mom. What kind of woman was grandma?
Sometimes it's good to have a pencil to write these things down.
Yeah, you know we spoke for a little bit...
You are gonna love this car. Even if you don't like Jon Voight.
You told David Putty your move and you didn't tell *me*? I *need* a move. You know I have no moves, Jerry. (points to the candy bar) Gimme a bite.
(CONT'D) Excuse me...I really... What's happened is that my friend forgot where he parked and if you're not in a big hurry, we'd really appreciate it if...
No, I don't know. Maybe you haven't. You know, not everybody's seen a massage table.
Damn you, laser guy! You had to grab it all with your lowbrow laser shtick! You're just a prop comic! Where's the craft?!
I suppose he could swivel. Hey maybe one of those director's chairs. What do you think of those.
I know someone wholl do it. Shes good. Shes honest.
Yes! (both laugh) God, I've never felt so alive!
(Panicky) Uh, yeah. You know, Doctor, I gotta tell you, I feel a lot better.
Well a lot of people consider me small and prestigious.
Hey, hey hey. Don't worry about me. I'm not a waffler. I don't waffle!
Oh, you haven't heard, she's going to live with her grandparents in Redding Pennsylvania.
I dont know, 120, 130Then they sent some guys to sandblast for 6 hours. Tomorrow they are putting in asbestos.
George Costanza. Susan's, uh, friend? Long time no speak.
Elaine, bald men, with no jobs, and no money, who live with their parents, don't approach strange women.
(on the phone) Uh, Mrs. Ross? It's-it's George.
(Sarcastic) Yeah, performance artist. She's a real performer. A real trooper.
I can't sell the book. It's been marked.
Yeah, eighty-three. Used to belong to John Voight.
It's "ooh" As in "ooh ooh ah ah."
This is very exciting! You're on the Tonight Show, NBC, who else is on the show?
What do you mean, I got? You didn't give him his Visa application.
This is fantastic. Man, what a weekend. Swimming, lobster for dinner...
You know, all these years, I've always wanted to see the two of you get back together.
(To Jerry) Let me ask you something.. How much do you think it would cost to have tonsils and adenoids removed in the hospital?
I mean you're just, you're just a marvel of organization.
Maybe she wasn't! Maybe she heard the whole conversation!
Well, maybe it was Ghostbusters? Where ever it was, it worked!
Well, Play Now is through playing. They turned the heat way up in my office. They tried to sweat me out.
I don't know why I bother even talking to you.
Ha! (snort) Can you believe it? (amused) I'm supposed to be havin' lunch with her right now at Pomodoro.
Well, I just had a fight - I need a group dynamic.
Who says you gotta have a story? Remember when we were waiting for, for that table in that Chinese restaurant that time? That could be a TV show.
(Reflecting on his life gone wrong) This McKigney guy had a few good years.. (To Kramer, bitter) How could you forget to turn off an iron?
Yes, Im Sorry, it's a new coat. It-it's Gore-Tex.
Well, I didn't think anyone would play it.
(to himself) Yeah, you said it. (to Wilhelm) Uh, excuse me, Mr Wilhelm. Uh, do you really think... Well, is this downtown trip really necessary, you know, for the project?
Well, it doesn't even have to be the general manager. Maybe I could be like, an announcer. Like a color man. You know how I always make those interesting comments during the game.
I mean we can put a man on the moon but we're still basically very stupid. The guy who's car this is? He could be one of the guys that built the rocket. You see what I'm saying?
They, uh... said you were with some guy who was wearing a cape?...
What do you think I mean bald? Bald. Bald bald.
Twelve dollars? I knew we should have gone to the bakery. I guarantee you theyre not getting no twelve dollar cake.
. . . naw, it's just you thanked HER, and and oh, . . . what's the difference?
Did you ever solve the riddle of the pie?
I've been doing a lot of thinking. This might be my chance to start giving something back.
Oh, oh. Uh, you know. It's the damndest thing. I, uh, I moved recently and my files, pfff, disappeared. Now, I-I don't know if they fell off the truck or if there was some sort of foul play but let me tell you something. I'm not through with that moving company.
Sperry Rand Building. 14th floor, Morgan Apparel. Mention my name - she'll give you the key.
Thats it! Thats it! I cant take it. I cant take it anymore! You stole the statue! Youre a theif! Youre a liar!
It's this way... AND THEY TAKE OFF AGAIN, PAIRING OFF
See, I knew it. I knew this was gonna happen...
No Don't get the camera , we don't need the camera. Listen I know your skeptical , but I really believe in the Chinese.
They don't need any water, so you don't have to keep taking them to the bathroom.
This is it! It happened to me, Jerry! I was sitting in the restaurant, the two nut jobs were talking - I couldn't take it any more. I got up, and (Makes a noise) I bop into this woman..
We've just been through this! You don't remember? We just had this exact same conversation a minute ago!
Hey, last night, I found a whole Weeble Village right behind the EZ Bake oven.
Yeah. I may have stepped on her arm, too, I don't know.
I think I may be in love with this woman.
No, I-I-I know... [retreats back to his Chinese take out] I know...
Come on. Come check out my new place. It'll take you two minutes.
(doing the voice) Im slippery as an eel
Wait, wait a minute...they don't have them anymore. I just found out, they just took them off the market.
He's actually doing him a favor. It's less money for him to buy food.
I'm not going to see that nut doctor she went to Europe with.
Well, Dr, Allenwood, uh...I was hoping to compile an - admittedly, rudimentary - scrapbook of her life. Something that Betsy could have, and hold onto.
Got it. (the waitress walks away) Did you just see what happened here?
(Scoffs) ARe you kidding? Lincoln Center. Alice Tully Hall, the Met. Magnificent facilities.
Is there ever a good time to have your parents stay with you?
(looking at his watch) I really should get going. Y'know, I..I wanna be home in case Neil calls.
You think this is the plane that Ted Danson gets?
Huh-Hi. (looks around a little) Uhm, is Neil here?
I can't believe it. Look, that's Jerry Seinfeld.
(bursting out of the bathroom, fumbling with his fly) Button fly! Why do they put buttons on a fly? It takes ten minutes to get these things open!
(to the saleswoman) You know honey for an unadvertised sale, you're doing a lot of yapping about it.
All right. (tearing his jacket off) Let me just say one thing there is no way that this is gonna happen. You hear me? No Way! Because if you think I'm going' to two Thanksgivings, you're out of your mind!!!
Well, I didn't want to break our date.
Oh, come on. What, are you kidding? GEORGE I'm much more comfortable criticizing people behind there backs. Anyway, look who's talking. You just broke up with with Melanie last week because she "shuushed you" while you were watching TV.
See, I think people would talk about it at the coffee machines.
Let me digest it. Let me get my money's worth. Y'know what would be good is if there was someone else in the bathroom that could tell me.
Oh, nothin' much, . . . talkin'. . . . Oh, oh, oh, did I have an unbelievable idea today!
You only went in front first 'cause you saw me backing up and you didn't have room to parallel park!
Wait a second. I think I see where that laser guy is. No! Don't look! Don't look. Oh, yeah, that's him. Ok. I'm gonna sneak up on him. Now the hunted becomes the hunter.
Of course he should consider it, but now is not the time!
I was, I had to leave. She lit some vanilla incenses. The smell drove me nuts, all I could think about was food, I had to get out of there. We need some pudding here! Pudding!
What is it about sex that just disrupts everything? Is it the touching? Is it the nudity?
Jerry, I can't talk to Jerry anymore. Ever since he moved into that apartment he's too much ... like you.
I snapped! It was the last straw. (sighs)
Well I just got back from swimming in the pool. And the water was cold...
Oh, real good. (George makes a face like you stink) Any word from NBC?
Wait a minute. (astonished) You're thinking of moving to Florida again?!
Neeson? How are you comparing Liam Neeson with Jon Voight? Jerry, we're talking about Joe Buck. If you can play Joe Buck, Oskar Schindler's a cake walk. (Opens the car door for Jerry, Jerry's about to get in.)
Of course, I'm the result of my parents having stayed together, so you never know. (Russell comes out of the bathroom.)
Excuse me...huh... I think I made a big mistake. I'd like my deposit back please.
No. He was fine with it. Check that out.
Just because a candy bar fails to fall from its perch
I have a point, I have a point.
Really? And Debby told me that she fell in love with him because he has all this perspective!
I can't go out there, he knows we're friends.
I got a job interview. They want to see me this afternoon.
(Silently squinches his mouth and nods at Kramer)
Well, I'm sure at some point between the years 800 and 1200--somewhere--there were two women living together.
Uh, yeah, I'll be there in a minute.
A cup of coffee. That, that doesn't mean anything.
I don't think I've ever spoken to her.
I don't even think she'd notice it. Can you see it?
So, he's keeping the apartment. He doesn't deserve it, though! Even if he did suffer, that was, like, 40 years ago! What has he been doing lately?! I've been suffering for the past 30 years up to and including yesterday!
All right, if she puts the bags down before she greets you, thats a good sign.
Well why couldn't you include me in your excuse?
I don't know, but those are my socks! I had a pair just like that with the blue stripe, and now I don't have them anymore!
What are these? (Holds test tubes to his head like antennae) Take me to your leader.
No, no, no... Just a *tiny* bit... It's not even *frontal* nudity. It's... *sidal* nudity...
What about these two? Aren't they gonna chip in?
No, it's a Newman. Well, I gotta run. (Smiles, pats his briefcase and exits.)
I can't. I gotta make the weekly call to the folks.
Uh, we're cool. Everything's cool (to security attendent)
Oh, man, it's spinach! I've been walking around like this all afternoon.
Well, I shouldn't have to pay for it!
S, uh, Superman - he, uh, built the fortress of solitude up at the North Pole, to, uh, you know, sort of get away from it all..
Oh, this is good. This Kruger guy is clueless. I can't wait to work for him.
(animated) N..no, no. You can't leave me. (frantic) Marry me! I'll burn myself. I'll burn my parents!
I guess there are no small diseases, only small actors.
Well, losing a loved is, uh...I mean, forget about it. (Starts wolfing down the sandwiches.)
Now, each of you is here because you're the best at what you do.
Now, listen closely. I was at the unemployment office and I told them that I was very close to getting a job with Vandelay Industries and I gave them your phone number. So, when now when the phone rings you've got to answer "Vandelay Industries".
Well, I was 14 years old. I was in my friends bathroom. His mother's brassieres were hanging on the shower rod and I picked it up, studied it. I thought, I like this. I didn't know what way or what level, but I knew I wanted to be around brassieres.
Hi. I'm ah, I'm here to see a Mr. Art Vandelay..
I'd like to sleep with a LOT of other women.
Yes, now. It's gonna take a few days and my parents are gonna be back. I gotta have it back before them!
Yes well unfortunately you'll never get the chance to find out.
Well, this is a lovely apartment. Lovely! My kids are gonna go crazy. I, uh, I wonder if I could see the bathrooms. Preferably one with some paint thinner and, uh, some rags?
What are they doin' lettin' you bastards on an airplane? Don't they know that's against FAA regulation?
Yeah, as a matter of fact, I did.
Well, I'll tell you, Stacey. It's a lot of hard work. But, it comes fairly easy to me. Some people write symphonies. This is my gift. (Raises ski lift ticket while Stacey looks away)
My parents? They don't know *what's* goin' on...
Dogs, twists, a kind of fermented chicken drink.
Fine. Excellent. Could you do me a favor? Could you not tuck the blankets in? 'Cause I can't sleep all tucked in.
Okay, I guess I'll see you down there.
I don't understand. They're supposed to be casting this week. Something's wrong. Maybe they're not doing it.
(very casual and raising his hand in the air) Yep. That's five!
Maybe I need someone who doesn't speak English.
Right, I got news. You ready? (deep breath) Gary Fogel had cancer.
What a fascinating turn of events. (Waitress approaches)
It doesn't matter if it's more comfortable. It's wrong.
You know, it's very impolite to tell secrets. Are you talking about me?
Yes of course go ahead. My guess is you're going to like this very much.
Of course! Alright, maybe I'll say something to Buck.
Huh? You know? Spring. Rejuvenation. Rebirth. Everything's blooming. All that crap.
Once, to a dog. He licked himself and left the room.
Well, we were engaged to be married, uh, we bought the wedding invitations, and, uh, yada yada yada, I'm still single.
She had this throaty , sexy kind of whisper.
Oh my god he's not kidding. (exhale gasp)
I had a little tiff with Bonnie about the roommate.
Oh, deserve! I don't know if I deserve...I mean...
I think it's neat. You don't hear that much about god anymore.
Hey, listen don't oversleep. You can't afford to be late again.
You're a very handsome man, by the way.
Hi. I-I really should be getting back to my fianc, you know, we, uh, we had this big fight yesterday and, uh, well she, she wants to-to know my secret code. I-I don't know, I can't tell her. The funny thing is, you know, I would really love to tell someone 'cause it's killing me. You uh, you wanna know what it is? It's Bosco. You know, the chocolate syrup? I love that stuff, I pour it in milk, it's my favorite drink. Hoo-hoo, boy, that is a relief!
(hitting Cynthia playfully with a napkin) Stop it, stop it.
Officer, could I just explain something to you?
Well, not recently. I craved. I crave all the time, constant craving...but I haven't yearned.
(frantic by now) SHUT UP,SHUT UP, SHUT UP,...(then leaves)
What did they do for toilet paper in the civil war?
So, uh, Mom, Dad, I was hoping that you could help me to remember my childhood a little clearly..
Did you ever see her lose her temper. I was once late cause I bought a Panama hat -- she grabbed it by the brim, pulled it down so hard my head came right through the top of it.
I don't like it, it's red. It it's too flashy.
I know Jerry. He has this phobia about public toilets. I think we really should go upstairs.
Hey, what happened with Sandy. I forgot all about it. Did you call her?
Two-man? It's all me. Kruger doesn't do anything; Disappears for hours at a time, gives me fake excuses. This afternoon I found him with sleep creases on his face. The only reason I got out to get a bite today was that he finally promised to buckle down and do some actual work. (turning around, George sees Mr. Kruger at a booth eating a piece of cake) Oh, I don't believe this. This is what I have to put up with, Jerry. (He walks over) Mr. Kruger? Who said he was going to do some actual work today? Who?
Oh, this isn't even B.O.! This is *beyond* B.O.! It's *B*.B.O.!
Thinking? Nothing. What could I possibly be thinking?
She hasn't seen the article! When she sees it, she's gonna think-- *I'm out baby*!! I'm out!!!!!
I just don't think it's such a great idea for you to sit here.
No no no no no, this has to be carefully orchestrated. You go to a fancy dinner, flowers...
He wants to meet you? I'll tell you what. I'll show up. He doesn't know we're friends. I'll pretend I haven't seen you since High School. I'll back up the story.
They always make me take stock of my life. And how Ive pretty much wasted all of it, and how I plan to continue wasting it.
(sets down his paper) So how were the eggs?
Whoop! Too late. I think he picked up the scent.
(Entering Jerry's apartment with a cartload of computers) Jerry, I've found a way to beat Lloyd Braun! I buy the computers myself, I store 'em in your apartment. Then, after I win the contest, I bring 'em all back and get my money back. Ha ha! It's brilliant. What? What's wrong with your leg?
I gotta call her. Should I call her?
I mean it's hard enough to meet a woman you dislike, much less like.
Wha-Is that the one your parents gave you?
(Rubbing his stomach) Ooh.. Something's not sitting right..
Well... what if you showed up bad naked, huh? You still got that belt sander?
Huh, really? How bad? Was he on his death bed?
I'm gonna go meet Danielle. (grabs his coat) There's a new Neil in town! (triumphant laughter) Hahaha!
Now, because of that stupid rye bread, I gotta keep them all separated for the rest of my life.
We get to go to the opera together!
(entering Jerry's bathroom) Well, Hanke's moved on to Step Ten. He was spotted taking personal inventory.
This is like a Penthouse letter...Why can't I meet women like this?
Woah, back it up, back it up. Beep, beep, beep. Tractor story?
May I just use your bathroom for a moment?
Yes she is. It's a pity we won't be seeing much more of her.
Yeah, is he still mad at you for crashing his Thanksgiving party?
I-I'm already here. I'm here. I'm here. Uh, you know what? If you want a computer, call me. I-I gotta go.
Imagine if I had to see them both on the same day? (mirthless) Haha! It's like runnin' a double marathon!
Ade, I have to tell you, I, I have never met anybody so ... efficient.
We'll just take a check. (She leaves the check. George, in all his cheapness, can't help but to review the check. He finds an error) You made a mistake on the..
She doesn't Want to talk, she needs to talk.
No difference. I could care less. She's Jerry's girlfriend.
That damn delicatessen that - that is last time they screw up one of my orders.
I can't believe you're not playing in cotton.
My father wears his sneakers in the pool! Sneakers!
Howbout Kramer or Elaine, they don't want them?
The guy that stole my glasses. This time I got 'em! (George follows the man onto the street, dragging the blind man with him) Would you pick it up a little?
Look at this sparkle. (looks up, sees Lindsay's mother) Mrs. Enright! (runs after her) Mrs. Enright! Mrs. Enright!
I'm going straight to hell, no two ways about it.
Because he made a big deal about how I understand everything immediately. That's what impressed him.
How could she leave us alone with this lunatic? Ten more minutes, and thats it! Im leaving. I have to tell you, this guy scares me.
(not happy delivering Elaine's lie) Well, he uh, he wants to uh, quit the exporting and uh, focus just on the importing. And it's a problem, because she thinks the exporting is as important as the importing.
So she starts vaccuming, back and forth, back and forth, her hips swivelling, her breasts, uh... (trying to think of a word)
All right. You understand now? It's not that complicated.
You don't want to suffer with this all weekend.
Was that wrong? Should I have not done that? I tell you I gotta plead ignorance on this thing because if anyone had said anything to me at all when I first started here that that sort of thing was frouned upon, you know, cause I've worked in a lot of offices and I tell you peope do that all the time.
No everything is *not* going good. I'm very uncomfortable. I have no power. I mean, why should she have the upper hand. *Once* in my life I would like the upper hand. I have no hand-- no hand at all. She has the hand; I have *no* hand...
(After looking in the bag) The pea pods? All you saved was the pea pods? (Kramer enters)
Is there a meal allowance? What about seat assignments? Could I have the Kosher meal? I hear the Kosher meal is good. And I need clothes. Gotta get a haircut. Gonna have to, I have to refill my allergy medication. Oh, do I need a hat? I need a hat, don't I? Could we do the Universal tour? They have that Backdraft exhibit now, that looks very cool to me...
(seeing Jerry's van shaking) What is that? That van's a-rockin'.
(entering) Last night, huh? Was that something, or was that something?
Uh, yes, uh...you don't know me, my name is George Costanza...did you happen to rent Breakfast At Tiffany's?
please please I don't want to die up here. please, stop moving that's all I'm asking.. Kramer!!
What I said? I say stupid things all the time I can't go two minutes without saying stupid things.
And then assuming the strike is resolved, on April 14th, we, ah, play the Angels. So lets clear a floor at the Anaheim Hotel.
[as if the word were totally foreign] My `stub'?
All right. Kramer, you block off traffic. You to go sweet-talk the pharmacist.
Three days. Well, maybe you caught her on the cusp of a new wash cycle. You know, she did laundry the day after she met you, everything got clean and she started all over again.
*I* think that *you* think that a certain *something* is not all that it could be, when in fact it is is all that it *should* be, and *more*!
Squirrel? Well, we have no deal with THEM!
Oh...uh, because if it had anything at all to do with what you perceived as me leering at your daughter, I really have to take issue with that. I did not leer. (To Jerry) Did I leer?
No keys. And I been calling the city all day. Course there's not really a number to call if you wanna make a pothole.
You know I uh, spilled a yogurt smoothie in here two days ago. Hm, Can't smell anything, can ya?
I banged it on the desk in the doctor's office. An (worriedly rubbing his arm) aaaa . . .
The Duty Free Shop? Duty Free is the biggest sucker deal in retail. Do you know how much duty is?
But I have to have them by one o'clock. He's very regiment about his meals.
What did I get or what do I say I got?
Sorry, we're a little late. We got so hung up in traffic.
I guess I should be, but Im not.
George.. (She doesn't seem to recognize him) George Costanza.
Hey, did you know that the Yankees don't wear cotton jerseys?
Eh, they're trying to pick out a new couch - you don't want to know. (Remembering the watching Van Buren Boys) Give me your wallet, or I'll spill your guts right here on the street!
Well I just got the estimate. It's going to cost more to fix that roof than the car's worth, So I'm going over to see that hospital administrator today. Someone is gonna pay for this damage and it's not gonna be me.
I can't have an affair with a married woman, that's despicable!
(wondering) Maybe he doesn't. Maybe he and I are exactly the same, except for one minor, yet crucial, detail. You never know.
All right, so what's the penalty here? Let's just pay the fine or something and get the hell out of here.
No, no, Kurt - wrong attitude. You should be happy now.
I'll leave when the guy comes in. I gotta tell you, I am loving this yada yada thing. You know, I can cross over my whole life story. (Picks up dental tool)
I never tasted a cough medicine I didn't love.
I thought I saw something fly over here...
I hurt it in a hotel room. You know where they tuck the covers in real tight in those hotel rooms? I can't sleep like that so I tried to kick it out and I pulled it.
That's perfect! He's a zoo guy! He take's care of animals. C-Can I bring the squirrel by?
So what?! She still gave you advice; what's the difference if she's not Chinese?!?!
I thought I saw him look in the mirror suspiciously.
(Laughs as they leave) It's working already! (Both exit)
My tonsils? Yeah, when I was a kid.
I lost them. I can usually come up with one good comment during a meeting but by the end it's buried under a pile of gaffs and bad puns.
Hey! Did 'ya ever do that thing on the toes that I said .
(pauses for a few seconds) OK, I'm tellin' you right now - if your kiddin' around I'm not gonna be able to be your friend anymore. I'm serious about that. You got that.
(humble) Well, if you must know, shhhe, was my fiance, Susan. May she rest in peace.
Cross the wires? I can't even make a pot of spaghetti.
I said faddah, I meant Father. Just a little bit nervous.
You couldn't figure out the World's Theory for yourself? It's just common sense. Anybody knows, ya gotta keep your worlds apart. (gesturing with hands going outward)
What are you doing? You're making more than I am. A secretary cannot make more than her boss.
I thought tomorrow maybe we'd try a little corn beef.
I told you to stop with the hopping.
We were in the lobby during the intermission of the play. I was buying her one of those containers of orange drink, for five dollars. I reached into my pocket to pay for it, I looked down; theres this piece of green floss hanging from my fingers.
Oh, he'll be here. By the way, Elaine, (reaches under the table and brings out a large coffee machine) thank you for laying out for the Arabian mocha java.
C'mon, c'mon...(stands up and physically rolls Betsy to the left side of the couch.) See, now, is that so bad?
I won't be able to, concentrate in front of you.
Only I hold the answer key to their true candy identities. And so, without further ado, I give you the candy line-up. (Opens a door to a back room. Various dealership employees are munching on candy bars)
No, he doesn't know O'Brien, if he knew O'Brien he wouldn't have a sign. Let's just do it.
You heard the man. I guess you gotta be moving your car.
Frolf, frisbee golf Jerry. Golf with a frisbee. This is gonna be my time. Time to taste the fruits and let the juices drip down my chin. I proclaim this The Summer of George!
(Sheepishly to Elaine) I'll be right back. (Leaves)
I can't have any parties while they're out of town. (he leaves to return the soaps)
(to Jerry) Have you seen the waitresses in there lately? I never had so much coffee in my life.
I couldn't have breakfast, it was lunchtime! The three hour time difference threw me. I wanted a tuna fish sandwich, they wouldn't serve me tuna fish sandwich, because they were only serving breakfast.
Yes, it is consistent. I've, uh, I've tried to maintain a consistent feel throughout the house.
It's fine, it doesn't have to be about nothing.
(panicky) What are you gonna do? Are you gonna call the police?
She didn't want to come, she-she's not really into sports.
Why doesn't *he* pick you up after the operation. He's got the car with the bench seats that you like.
We'll ask him. (opens partition) My dear fellow, where are you dropping us?
All right, all right, calm down, calm down. Whatever happened in the past is past.
Well I am. Couldn't you try to go through some of that stuff I put in your shoebox?
What was the tallest woman you ever slept with?
No, no, no, see you're not really listening.
Oxygen! I need some oxygen! This is major.
He's got a gun! He's got a gun! Get out of the way! (Tries to flee the bar in a mad panic. The audience in the club also goes nuts and heads for the exits. Jerry stands onstage, perplexed.)
No! No. It's not good, I don't think so.
They're not mocked and humiliated when they get to the other side.
Well you know what happens with larvae hatch, they-they're everywhere.
So I saw that new movie about the Hindenburg.
You think the person you were talking to is him? That's not even close to him. He's funny, Jerry's funny.
Oh I hate to hear this. That kind of growth really irritates me.
Hey, Buck. Talk to you for a second?
She called my office. She said shes been in the Hamptons since Sunday. She didnt know if I was trying to get in touch with her. Her machine broke, and shes been using her old machine and she doesnt have the beeper for it.
So she's just sitting there, she's having a pleasant conversation... and all of a sudden.
Grateful? How can you be grateful when you're *so* close to the end? When you know that any second-- Poof! Bamm-O! It can all be over. I mean you're not stupid, you can read the handwriting on the wall. It's a matter of simple arithmetic, for Gods sake...
Excuse me. Can I talk to you for a second there, Watkins?
What happened to the screen door? It blew off again?
No, no. Forget it. I don't want it. Let's just get rid of it.
Babu Bhatt? How I'm going to explain this?
Y'know what it is? It's "Clara Nightingale Syndrome." He falls ill; she falls in love.
Is he a clown? What, are you kidding me!?
(still in Jacks voice) I'm working on my Jack Nicholson, You can't handle the truth! (he salutes)
I think she wants me to take her home.
Oh, you might want to stick around Jerry. Mr. Thomassoulo picked the wrong man to hire because he was fake handicapped.
Yes, they are bold. Jerry, what do you think?
(seeing Elaine and Puddy come into Monk's) Yeah. Hey, Lainie, Puddy.
No one's putting a gun to your head. Do I, uh, scare you?
So I said, "Mr. Hayman, It's me george Costanza, JFK, ... " He doesn't move. So I said uh, "Can't stand ya'", "Can't stand ya'" He turns and smiles, the little baked bean teeth. I get up to run away, but something was holding me back. It was Heyman. He had my underwear. There I was on the steps of the 42nd St. library , a grown man, getting a wedgie.
What? I'm not eating bread now. I'm off bread.
Oh, well, he was probably just getting anxious to start his vacation.
(still quiet) Think, a second. You know, your friend was talking about me and, you know...
Aw, come on. I wanna go see him.
Do you know what happens if I miss him? I don't get credit for the pickup and I lose my 50 bucks...
She's off. (goes over to the now available public phone)
Wait a minute, wait, it's not that stupid.
Yeah, the kind that Castro smoked. You can't buy ?em anywhere.
Where do you come up with this stuff?
Alright, I gotta go home and open up with the house for the carpet cleaners. You know they're doing my whole place for twenty-five dollars.
What red dot? What are you talking about? Jerry come here for a second. Do you see anything here?
And everything else has changed. But toilet paper is exactly the same, and will be so until we're dead.
It's all worked out. Nina and I will have dinner Thursday at the restaurant where Babs works.
What, he can't jump out of the chair? How long does that take? Here look at this. (he moves to the end of the booth) Here, watch. (stands up) Criminals. Boom. I'm up. (pretends he's shooting) Stop It! Stop It! Stop It!
No. I am not giving my code to anyone for any reason.
I tried to tell you, but you wouldnt listen. No, ho, ho! You were gonna get a deal, huh? Theres no laws in this place. Anything goes! Its Thunderdome!
I know. The only way to fix it now, is to get a whole new photo of Kruger.
Oh, well, I'm sure you can reach her...she's a poet. What does a poet need an unlisted number for?
The woman she's "lesbianing" with? Susan told me she's *never* been with a guy.
Ohh, hey there, young fella. (They shake hands) What's your major?
Thats why, you know, a shake is bad.
Yeah, yeah, well, because of the cane. You should see the bathroom they gave me!
No, but um I have very good report with women, very good, comfortable. And from the first time I laid eyes on a brassieres, I was enthralled.
I'll try some on and see how they look. It's just hair.
You think she thinks I have a beautiful face, or is she just saying that?
I'm gonna go with you. I gotta get a new suit. I got a second interview with MacKenzie, and I think I'm really close. They're all taking me out to lunch on Friday.
Oh, she didn't think it was funny. What is she, Rowan & Martin? We're supposed to meet with NBC tomorrow! She completely shattered my confidence. And I'm paying for this, she's my employee!
No. She tried to give me the "it's not you, it's me" routine.
Well, sometimes you can't help these people 'til they hit rock bottom.
(Praising Leo's stealing) Alright, Leo! Stickin' it to the man!
No. Youd be surprised. You dont recover that quickly from a nose job.
I'm going to a poetry reading with PATRICE First time poets, in a burnt out building, down by the docks, Supposed to be good.
Thanks a lot. I'm really late. My parents are waiting in front of my building and we're stuck here.
No, no. That's just the thing. Anna told me that Elaine said I was one of the worst seeds she'd ever seen.
Tell you what, I'll make a deal with you. I'll sell it to you right now for ten bucks.
(Mocking, skeptic) Yeah, you show us the 900.
You could take the IQ test for me. I could pass it to you out a window. We could do it, she lives in the first floor.
Now my parents are gonna know I had people over.
Whatever!!. . . . Oh oh oh this is unbelievable. This is better than my bed at home.
I can't go anywhere, I have to wait here for Tatiana's call. Let me just check.
Oh no, Morgan is a good man sir.
Get a good night's sleep, alright fellas. (thumbs up) Big day tomorrow!
(crafty) Not necessarily. Why don't you take back the couch you gave me?
Jon Voight! Are you kiddin' me? Did you talk to him?
Eh, gee, I hope you have the key for these things.
Oh, you spoiled, spoiled man. Do you now how much mental energy I expend just trying to picture women naked?
. . . WELL IT WAS A BIG SALAD. AND WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IS, HOW DOES A PERSON WHO HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE BIG SALAD CLAIM RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT SALAD AND ACCEPT THE THANK YOU UNDER FALSE PRETENSES - AH - AH?
Well, wha-what about the toe? What happened to the toe?
Alright, so I haven't put anything in it since sixth grade, I completely forgot about it. The State Controller's Office tracks me down. The interest has accumulated to 1,900 dollars. 1,900 dollars! They're sending me a cheque!
Let's say it comes down to me and one other guy. He's got a nice quiet suit, and I'm whooshing all over the place! Who do you think he's gonna hire?
All right, come on, come on, let's go. Six dollars.
They had a pastry cart you wouldn't believe.
I'm not getting on a regular plane now - I'm all psyched up to go on a private jet. No way I'm getting on a regular plane.
(Walks off) I got a lot of thinking to do.
Oh yeah, but that has nothing to do with it.
So, you wanna go home and...make up, officially?
They're -- They're killing independent George! And they're, they're all in on it! World's are colliding!
Well, uh... come in, come, come in. (frantically clears the couch of newspapers and crumbs)
Alright, how's this? We wait till we get to your street corner, we see Elaine and Kramer then we get out. They can't shoot us in the city.
(he thinks a little about it... and as he puts his hand on his knee and gets up) I'm sorry Karen. I know I care for you, but I just can't stand when someone doesn't like me. (he opens the door)
Pssh. Would the protg pick up stuff for the mentor?
They're worse! They're much worse than us, they talk about everything! Couldn't you at least tell her about the shrinkage factor?
I'm not stable? I'm like a rock. I take these glasses off, you can't tell the difference between me and a rock. I put these glasses on a rock. You know what jumps into most people's minds? Costanza!
Tell me about it. I went out with this girl last week. First I had to pay for dinner, then--
(Depressed) Well,.. the Andrea Doria.. that was quite a fire. (Moves to the door, leaving)
Oh, thanks, Bobby. (To Celia) Well, I guess I'll see you in four days.
Yeah. Actually it was in gym class. I was trying to climb the ropes and Jerry was spotting me. I kept slipping and burning my thighs and then finally I slipped and fell on Jerry's head. We've been close ever since.
(Scoffs) No, I told you, I'm not gonna do that.
(Yelling from the bathroom) Don't tell her anything, she'll kill me!!
Hey, Ring Dings are better than anything you're gonna get at a bakery.
I never assisted in a birth before. Its really quite disgusting.
Hey! Uh--listen--did you get your--uh--boss's Knick ticket, for Kramer?
I should be in a place like this. I envy this woman. Ya' get to wear slippers all day. Friends visit. They pity you. Pity is very underrated. I like it it's good. Plus they give you those word association tests. I love those.
(quietly) ehh. (pausing to look at both of them) So what made you change your mind?
So how do you want to do this?
Yes. Me, too. I wanna be normal. Normal.
I solve problems. That's just what I do.
(pleasant surprise) Really? (admonishing) You know Gary, I really have to say, I'm a little bit hurt that you didn't decide to confide in me.
Yeah, anyway, she's uh, having some kind of a family lunch, I'll swing by after.
No. No it's not. You don't know this guy. It woulda been so sweet.
Yeah, I would. It's just, you know, I just ate a whole pot roast.
Do you think it would be better if I did?
No, she's taking this course in education for her masters. It's part of her research project, so I have to be a guinea pig.
It's like going to the bathroom in front of a lot of people and not caring.
Gee, Kramer, I uh...I don't know what to say.
Thank you! Thank you very much. (Jerry and Melissa stop and look at George)
So, I'm uh, I'm afraid we're going to have to pass.
You see? Now that is a handsome man. (Elaine and Jerry look right at George) Oh please.
Why would I spend seven dollars to see a movie that I could watch on TV?
You lie! How hard is it to lie?!
Wait a second, wait. Why are we together?
Dad, you really should lay off the 'serenity now' stuff.
yeah that's right. I like it. He's such a cool guy
Me run in? Why don't you run in?
(smiling) Uh, hi. Uhm, remember me? I..I'm the guy who looks like Neil?
(Yelling out to a waitress) Gonna need some water here!
When I find that guy, this much I vow those glasses will be returned to their rightful owner.
Hey, let's turn off the lights, get some real 'movie atmosphere.'
(nervous) All right now we're going bye bye.
(Complaining) I can't read it. I need my glasses!
Oh, please ... ... four dollars is f...
Elaine and her sponges...she's got like, a war chest full of them.
Canceled? Do I still get credit for the pick up? I was here!
Kramer, what are you talking about...Janet doesn't look anything like Jerry
He's with the touring company of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. He's the guy in charge of the wigs.
I love that bathroom. It's got that high, high toilet. I feel like a gargoyle perched on the ledge of a building.
Jerry, it's me, George, don't worry, I'll return it tomorrow, no problem.
Marisa Tomei! I, just spoke to Marisa Tomei! (sitting opposite Elaine) And I wasn't even that nervous.
[to himself] Oh, my God! It's Susan! What do I do?
Why did you give him my ticket for?
Anyway, so he gave me his spare keys, now he wants to have my keys, so I need mine back from you.
We all got along. Everyone seemed very pleasant.
Of course you will. (quick chuckle). You're the best. (with a light fist motion across her chin)
Why don't you just get some Ring Dings from the liquor store?
The doctors thought he had cancer, but the surgery revealed he never actually had it.
Oh, yes. I - I'm your baby bluey.
(to Elaine) Do you want us to go with you?
That's really very nice of you, Eva. Thank you.
Hey. You know, do I have a case for you guys to do on L.A. Law.
Know him? Would you, uh, like to meet him?
I'm against all "it's me"s. So self-absorbed and egotistical, it's like those hip musicians with their complicated shoes!
Perhaps. (hehe) I walk in, everything is organized -- messages, appointments. And I can't tell you how proud I am of myself for going with Ade.
(tasting the wine) Excellent. Like I really know what I'm talking about.
Really? (Jerry nods his head) Well, what if it doesnt stop? Oh, that I really needed to hear. That helps a lot! All right, just say something. Just start talking. Change the subject. Lets just go, All right? I cant believe were having dinner with Alton Benes.
Heh heh heh hey, new suit (raises coffee cup as a salute / toast)
(Opens the door, looks in and then knocks 5 times) Mr. Steinbrenner, (waves) can I talk to you for a second?
Celia broke out of prison. I'm sitting in my home, she shows up at the door!
(Relieved) I haven't? I'm okay? I'm okay? Oh, thank you, thank you, Doctor! I don't know how to thank you.
You know what? I can't do this. I can't read books anymore; books on tape have ruined me, Jerry. I need that nice voice. This book has *my* voice. I hate my voice.
Cmon. Wilkinsons got millions invested in this stock. Its gone up three points since Ive been watching it.
'My wife's in a coma.' Yeah? Well, the life support machine called and...
So, she went out with you on a first date.. and it was her birthday?
Who's Bozo? Bozo the Clown, that's who Bozo is. When I was a kid, Bozo the Clown was the clown, bar none.
Right. And, and to cover my nervousness I started eating an apple, because I think if they hear you chewing on the other end of the phone, it makes you sound casual.
Maybe it's not even stupidity. Maybe it's just a blatant disregard for basic human decency. Yeah this how dictator's start. Do you think Mussolini would circle the block six times looking for a spot?
Well the sex was okay, but I threw up from the Hennigans.
Smarter than me? I don't want anyone smarter than me.
You want to hear more? The master bedroom opens into the solarium.
What are you like a sadist? No matter how bad somebody feels, you can make 'em feel worse. I bet you're rooting for a tumor. (pointing to her)
Wow. Uh, what do I have to do?
Salsa is now the number one condiment in America.
(singing) Master of the house/Doling out the charm/Ready with a handshake and an open palm/Tells a saucy talk/Loves to make a stir/Everyone appreciates a...
(shouted after Elaine) You know, I got nothing outta this!
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's in the vault. I'm putting it in the vault.
So how long has it been in the basement?
Don't worry, we'll find something for you. (Knock of Jerry's door)
I don't know, I have to call her, tell her where we are. I'm very lucky she's even considering seeing me at all.
Every woman on the face of the earth has complete control of my life. And yet, I want them all.. is that irony?
Hennigans. I was there sitting in the office and the cleaning woman comes in. I've always been attracted to cleaning women. Cleaning women, chambermaids.
Yeah. One second sweetheart. Jerry, I really think it'd be easier if you didn't tuck.
So, she's the loser of the group. Every group has someone that they all make fun of.. Like us with Elaine. (Jerry thinks about this, then shakes it off)
No, it hit the table, it hit the table.
Give me the phone. (dials) Yea, Hi I would like to speak to Patrice. ... what? ... oh really? ... oh, ok, thank you, ... (hangs up)
You see, It's right here. It's all white...
If my parents had a mantel, I might be a completely different person.
What happens to charter tickets when you don't use em?
Oh! Nuts! Excellent! You know what I love? How there's two nuts named after people. Hazel...and filbert.
...yeah, my wife started getting on me about the lawn today. Im tellin you, its one thing after another.
I can't go in there. I can't face the bubble boy.
[realizing the only way out is to show the stub] I've got the stub.
A preemptive breakup. This is an incredible idea. I got nothing to lose. We either break up which she would do anyway but at least I go out with some Dignity. Completely turn the tables. It's absolutely brilliant.
(Snaps, then points to the coffee table) Hand me an Emory board.
Oh... (George looks around and sees the chef hiding behind a plant it's Bob!)
What's wrong? I'll tell you what's wrong. I just committed adultery!
I forgot to ask you; how did the revenge date go?
(Not really wanting to embellish) ..I stopped by the house to drop the car off, and I went inside for a few minutes.. Nobody was there - they're supposed to be working. (Jerry and Elaine look at each other - enjoying the story) My mother had a Glamour magazine, I started leafing through it..
Why don't we talk about it another time.
I havent seen it yet, but its a two-bedroom, its on the uh, west 83rd, bout a half block from the park?
I tought I picked up a little something. I'm very good at this. Did you pick up anything?
(Interrupts) And I still say hes naked under there!
Because it's really a pretty good little story. Don't you think?
Wow, he really does a number on you. (reads) "Seinfeld froze like a deer in the headlights in the face of incessant heckling."
(Takes a sip) Hey, it's not too bad..
...pianist. A *classical* pianist. She *plays* the piano. She's a *brilliant* woman. I-I-I sat in her living room... She played the *Waldstein Sonata*! The *Waldstein*!
Look, we're wasting our time here! We're a half-hour late, they've probably took it off the board already.
(on a pay phone) Hey, hey, it's George, I need ya to do me a favor.
Nose. (chuckles) What's the worst that can happen to a nose? What does it get? Stuffed? (chuckles)
What kind of a sick, demented person wants another person's glasses?
I don't think we should see each other any more.
"There's a lot of money in this.. He's got a proven sales method"
The plane's been re-routed *back* to Kennedy. We've got 45 minutes.
I dont know. But I dont. Im actually almost happy to hear it.
I wouldn't hear of it, Todd. It's none of my business. But you should try to find out everything you possibly can. In fact, I'll even stay all the way on the other side of the room just so there's no chance of me overhearing anything.
Who gets picked off in softball? Its unheard of.
What do you mean you will? That's a bad idea. Jerry is a very private person.
(Leading Nina out the airport) Oh, no. No. We're good. Let's get goin'. Alright. (Almost bumps into Jerry) Watch it, funny man. (Leaves)
(Trying to keep it down) Because I like this one! (Notices people staring at him, he quickly gets up, collecting the his coat and the tiny replica) C'mon, let's go. Let's go! (On his way out, he stops in front of a woman blocking his path) Oh, hi.. (Embarrassed about the doll, he sheepishly walks out)
Why didn't you ask me? I know a million theater jokes. 'What's the deal with those guys down in the pit?'
Her scalp was clean. She had a nice skull. There just wasn't a lot of hair on it.
What, is that the one your parents gave you?
So, what's in the cooler? (flips open the lid)
I told her what a sexist he is. How he cheats on his wife.
I'm just gonna...wash. (George walks to the bathroom; screaming) WHY DID I PUT UP TWO? WHY DID I PUT UP TWO?
What do you mean - "Not letting you?"
Oh, Scott, Scott. He's really great, isn't he?
They send me? Aw right ..ask 'em Does it really work?
She doesn't deserve a baby shower. She deserves a baby monsoon. She deserves Rosemary's baby!
Kramer, I can't help you. You're gonna have to get them some place else.
'Why don't I rent the movie.' See, this is when I like you. Alright, now I'm relieved. (Kramer enters and comes over to the booth.)
This good be so sweet, Jerry. Saving lives? She's one step away working at the clinique counter!
I went in with a pretty woman? You know, kinda short, big wall o' hair, face like a frying pan?
(Puts nuts into his mouth, and in the process covers his mouth) We bring her to the party, and she can tell me what Gwen is saying about me.
I suppose he's an attractive man, I ,
Yeah. I don't think they'll be able to tell.
I said preferably cashmere, for warmth. So in front of the whole party, he says, 'No. I don't want you stretching out the neck hole.'
What! There's no signs here! This is an outrage!
Well you know, if you were sitting right next to her you'd have to console her no matter what.
Well, we just blew 240 bucks on a wheelchair.
I don't know. A little thing called Step Nine? Instead of an apology, he was beboppin' and scattin' all over me.
(embarrassed/self-conscious about his gut) Do I? Thanks.. You too..
Absolutely. You're telling me there's no room to move on pasta. All starches are a scam.
I wanna bite into a big hunk of cheese, just bite into it like it's an apple.
Yeah, Jimmy why don't you wait outside, you know, play with something.
Yeah well, they won't know. I got the car there.
(shouting) I'm not looking for another line. I got the line.
Every time we go out to eat the minute we we're done eating she's runnin to the bathroom.
Apparently the Seinfelds' are too good for us. I shouldn't say anything bad about your uh your partner.
You, uh, wanted to see me, Mr. Steinbrenner?
He probably doesn't want to get chocolate on his fingers. That's the way these society types eat their candy bars.
I don't know, I just can't. Nobody in my family can pay for parking, it's a sickness. My father never paid for parking; my mother, my brother, nobody. We can't do it.
All right, you know you're not any help at all here. I don't know what even the point is of talking to you anymore.
It's really not accurate. Nobody drinks from a water cooler any more - they use bottles.
Yeah? Well, I had sex with your wife.
Who's going to bomb you. An airline for all the stupid little peanut jokes.
She's not there. She left. She must've waited and left because those people wouldn't get off the phone.
Hey I'll get married if I have to. Al Netchie will think twice before he opens his mouth about me again.
(pause) Dad! I heard you were in the city the other day!
No, no, no. Out of the question. I was over there today. He's got the good spot in front of the good building in the good neighbourhood. I know he's not gonna wanna move.
I know. That's the point. If it's gonna get sexual, it should get sexual with you.
(holding a magazine cover) Mira Sorvino. Think she'd go out with me?
Thats all there is to it. By Christmas day I will be Brother Costanza.
I probably didn't hear it on the way over because of the street noise. (he panics) This is no good! I got to meet these guys from MacKenzie for lunch in half an hour!
What? No dibs! I need this statue. Cmon, give it!
(To Rachel) And, uh, you eat eggs, right?
Yes. Yes. Care. You know who I think about a lot? Remember SUSAN ? The one that used to work for NBC?
And so, for all these reasons, we are officially broken up. (shuts book and reaches for door) Thank you, (opens door) and good night.
Oh! Modelling! What's that like? Fun? Ha ha. (to self in head) Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!
Ha, I don't know who she's looking for. I don't know. I'll tell you something. She's very particular, your daughter. Very particular. What is she looking for some big hot shot businessman? Well I've got my pride too. I'm not going to beg her.
I love when they touch your arm. I can't get enough of that. Why is that?
(angrily)"WHY WEREN'T YOU MORE CAREFUL WITH YOUR DROOL!"
Have you seen Jerry? (sitting beside Elaine) I told him two o'clock.
(gets up to leave the table) HELLO!!! (angrily)
That's a shame. (Karen is shown singing off-key on the television.)
Oh, I love full lips. Something you can really put the lipstick on.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. As long as youre going to lie to the guy, why dont you tell him that you lost both of the tickets, then we can go?
Hey, I brought you some cigarettes. You buy yourself something nice.
(Mr.Wilhelm comes in and hears George yelling) You tell that son of a bitch no Yankee is ever comin' to Houston! Not as long as you bastards are running things!
Time like what? I'm hungry. My stomach doesn't know that Kramer's wanted.
I just pray Kruger doesn't realize that it's gone until this guy can fix it up.
No, I was just wondering... if you guys, uh, had any gum.
She missed her period? Oh my god. I can't believe it! I'm a father! I did it! My boys can swim! I can do it! I can do it!
No, I don't have any change. I never carry change.
Yes, yes of course. The Pensky file. Ho ho, can't wait to sink my teeth into that. Wow that Pensky. Well we'll straighten him out.
Na, he's gone. I wonder what happened to him.
We ordered the wedding invitations today,, Nothing can stop it now. Nothing. It's here! It's happening. Can I do this? I can't do this...Look at me. Look at me I can't do this, I can't do this (manic) Help me Jerry, help me.
Ah, I've had everything on the menu. Uh, surprise me.
So, if Susan and I had... I mean, if the envelopes hadn't, uh... then we--
Mister Seinfeld? What about Mister Costanza? I'm not here?
I got scared there for a second. The Knicks without Ewing.
Uh, let me ask you a question. Could you, uh, expand the space underneath a desk to give it a little more headroom?
I can't take it anymore! I'm going to work! ARe you happy now?! (Gathers his things, and runs out of the coffee shop. Elaine and Jerry laugh hysterically)
I don't want to! I'm outta money! I got 714 dollars left in the bank.
(reluctant) Oh that uh, that seems like a lotta trouble.
If I see things as they are, I would ask 'why' or 'why not?'
Let me ask you something. What do you think of this shirt?
Why do they have to do that in front of people?
I'm just sayin' I wanna have some fun.
Take care. Take it easy. (Tom leaves with the casting director)
Because important things go in a case. You got a skull for your brain, a plastic sleeve for your comb, and a wallet for your money.
Are you sure? Oh, look who I'm talking to. The president of NBC. (forced laughter)
Oh, well, don't worry about it -- he's got plenty of money. (spins his chair away from her)
You know what I think? I bet she stole a tractor.
(shifty, avoiding Jerry's eyes) Fine, fine. (he removes his coat)
Are you crazy? You take your life in your hands with those nuts.
Hey I get a free trip to Paris, I go in the Big Brother's Hall-of-Fame, I mail my own postcards.
(leaving) Yeah, Sure, sure ,,, I got to drop my car off at the new lot.
Yes! I'm not giving him the satisfaction, it's my space.
Especially her. She does not like disappointment. Well, I have to do it. I can't make December. There's no way I can make December. Right? I mean, you can see that, right? I mean, look at me. Look. Look. Can I make December? I can't make December. Right? Look. Look.
Oh, well, uh. Gary told me you said hi.
Ya and also I'm afraid that people in that state are finally going to tell me what they really think of me. You know they got nothing to lose what do they care?
Of course I mean that. I am incapable of guile.
Today. Im going today. Just dont do anything until you hear from me.
Jerry, it's me, George, don't worry, I'll return it
Well, at least, I'm not carrying a purse.
Well good, good. Take it off you're going to wear it out already. It's for special occasions this thing.
This is all too much. So what are you feeling? What's going on? Are you like a couple again now?
Hey. I've kept the same job for more than two years. It's not luck. Elaine, have you ever sent a racy photograph of yourself to anyone?
So you could call a woman for a date, ask her if she's free for Dinner and a flamenco?
Faking? What makes you think that I have time to see doctors, take X-rays, make appointments, when there's absolutely nothing wrong with me? What kind of a person would do a thing like that?
I don't know. I closed my eyes and made a move.
Oh yes I am Father. Incredibly sincere. So, uh, pffft, am I in?
Yeah, yeah, me to miss -- I miss.
Come on, hurry up, old man! I'm an animal!
I don't even drink wine. I drink Pepsi.
You have any idea how fast these things deteriorate when there's an 'I love you' out of the bag? You can't have a relationship where one person says, "I love you", and the other says, "I'm hungry. Let's get something to eat.".
I bet they have more money than mine.
Well, it's kind of a mystery, isn't it?
Gary? Well, well, well well. Where the hell've you been? I've been leaving you phone messages for months.
(pauses to consider this then gives in) All right. (starts heading towards bedroom)
We cant just let him get away with this.
I was handcuffed to the bed.. In my underwear, (Sighs) where I remained.. (Scene cuts to another story) She was attractive.. She was, also, infact, a Nazi.. (Cuts to another story) The water.. that I had been swiming in was.. very cold. And, when I dropped the towel, there was.. significant shrinkage.. (Scene cuts to, yet, another story) Her parents were looking at me.. So, there I was, with a marble rye hanging from the end of a fishing pole.. (Scene cuts to his closing statements) In closing, these stories have not been embellished, because - they need no embellishment. They are simply, horrifyingly, the story of my life as a short, stocky, slow witted bald man. (Gets up) Thank you. (Every memeber of the board shows some sign that George's story is most deserving of the apartment. Ricardi is crying. George turns to leave, then remembers one more thing..) Oh, also.. my fiance died from licking toxic envelopes that I picked out. (Sobs and loud crying erupts from the board members) Thanks again. (Leaves. Eldridge looks defeated)
(hearing Jerry broke up with Patty) Are you still down in the dumps? Come on. It's just a chick.
(bored to death) Well, I-I just recently uh...
I'm trying to buy some of the clothes back. (realizing something) Hey you wanna come over for dinner tonight? My mother made all this extra Paella.
Uh, anyway, (Waving bye to everyone) onward and upward.
I want you to have this job. Of course...
I'll tell you what. Why don't we just get a couple of dishes and we'll just share 'em.
Yeah, I grabbed it on the way out, I don't want my mother reading it.
(Looks fed up with his parents) Oh my God..
Whew! Anybody see that poster in there? That is weird, wild stuff, huh? Whew!
Besides, what's it gonna cost me? Thirty-eight bucks?
My card won't work there; they're not on the Plus system.
It just didnt work out. What can I do? I wanted to love her. I tried to love her. I couldnt.
Well, it always has to be explained to me, and then I have to have someone explain the explanation.
Well, what's so great about a Mom and Pop store? Let me tell you something. If my Mom and Pop ran a store, I wouldn't shop there.
Oh, the busboy left the menu a little close to the candle.
I'm sorry, uh, it's not like I'm gonna see something I've never seen before.
No, but I can tell she's going to. I can sense it. We had this terrible phone conversation. I was so nervous before I called I made up this whole list of things to talk about.
(handing over a bill) Can I get a pack of gum, please?
Of course you do... It's just, uh, y'know, I-I never *knew*, uh, that, uh...
That's not funny. So, are you coming to the party?
(breaks a long silence) The uh, the shoe laces that you bought me, they uh, they worked out well. (thumbs up)
This is a real piece of junk. I don't even feel safe on this thing. I have a good mind to write a letter toMr. Kimbrough.
Well, you know, It's interesting, you know, under that pressure, what you're capable of.
That's right...We just had sex......You know Jerry I've been searching for someone a long time. Well the search is over.
It's like the manager coming out and asking you for the ball.
Well, I was exaggerating a bit, just for effect.
(hanging up) All right, Jerry. I'll do it. See ya.
I'm sorry I'm sorry, here's the test. Thanks again for doing this - hhe.
Oh, gotta get fifty. Gotta get fifty. All right, I tell you what. We go to the coffee shop, you call your manager. Maybe they made an offer.
Ha Haaaaaaa... Jerry how do you like that.You see I get myself in a dizzy, I'm all worked up and for what?
(we hear him think) My friends are idiots, she doesn't look like Jerry. She doesn't look like anybody. And so what if does look like Jerry,what does that mean?. That I could have everything I have with Jerry but because it's a woman I could also have sex with her....And that somehow that would be exactly what I always wanted.....She doesn't even look like Jerry..
Oh now you're gonna go? ELAINE I'll be back in five minutes.
Sure, well uh, you know I'll check in with you next week uh, I gotta run now because I got a full plate this afternoon. All right, really go to uh,.
So, we watching the movie, or are we still talking? (Joe's wife shakes her head and goes into the other room. George gestures to Remy to move.) Okay, c'mon. Let's go.
You're giving me the "it's not you, it's me" routine? I invented "it's not you, it's me". Nobody tells me it's them not me, if it's anybody it's me.
This woman left this really sexy message on Jerry's tape recorder......
I can't believe that you saw her before me.
Oh no no no no, don't say anything to Kramer. Susan can't stand him. He vomited all over her.
All right, we'll be a little late, I,m not taking a cab.
When do you ever have ten car lengths?
I think things were going ok. We were having a nice conversation.
You can't do that, it's none of your business!
Carol, thats so rude. Please, Im serious, just for a moment, if you wouldnt mind. And then well talk to Jerry.
I do too. you see that's what we're about . You don't remind me of anyone and we love gum.
Listen. I want you guys to send along those agreements the minute you land. Our boys can't wait to kick your butts!
Yeah, well, I guess the only thing I can do is go into George Steinbrenners office and tell him he has to give her a raise.
Oh, the hell with it. Let him kill me. I..
Daphne. I have to tell you something, this is very difficult...
I dont know what the hell I said. I gave her an ultimatum and theres nothing I can do. Its a machine. The little light is blinking right now, Come and listen to the idiot. Hey everybody, the idiots on!
Yeah. Not only that, this is what she said to me, "Can we change the subject?"
Or we don't even send the check and then when they call, we pretend we're the cleaning service. Heh heh. "Hello? I sorry, no here Kruger."
Hey, Jerry, what was the name of the exterminator who fumigated your apartment when you had fleas?
What do you think about a rocking chair?
All right You really want to know?...It all started when she told met hat...she was the voice on your tape recorder.
All right. All right. Let's - let's go over that again.
(whispering) Glenda, can I ask you a favor? Can I have this seat?
(enthusiastic) Yeah. You get a couch. I get rid of my father. It couldn't be more perfect!
The rule is a minimum of two days.
Well, I think we need more special days at the stadium, you know? Like, uh...Joe Pepitone Day. Or, uh...Jon Voight Day.
My presence, in that office, can only hurt my chances.
They could kick me out of the health club if he tells them!
You know, it was really wrong of you to back out on that deal.
I used to share that same outlook. But now, I have so many things to occupy my mind. For instance, the atom.
Eh, but, you know, Mr. Ross, if - if you look at the whole situating, what with it being your cigars, and everything, it's really rather ironic - one might even say, in a sense, comical.. (Mr. Ross has, by now, left the room. Mrs. Ross is pointing at George, nodding, laughing. As if to say he hit the bullseye. George calls out to Mr. Ross) Really. Think about it.
You know. You use the, uh...(mutters something unintelligible under his breath.)
Eat me alive, huh? We'll see who can make it in *this* town.
I am not buying something just to get change.
Well, I like to stay in touch with the people.
Do you know how much this is going to cost me?
Lemme see. I can't believe you got these for free. (Looking at the tickets) Row F?!
You want me to roll six thousand of these?! What, should I quit my job?!
(Studying the salt shaker) I'm not taking a civil service test.
We got a soccer game in Chile. Anyway, the plane crashes. Who are you gonna eat to survive?
Yeah, I told her how toilet paper hasn't changed in my lifetime, and probably wouldn't change in the next fifty thousand years and she was fascinated, fascinated!
Well, sure. They're Jewish, and you're a shiksa.
(Like a kid) Because I don't want to.
Excuse me, I'm sorry to bother you, I noticed that you have a textbook on tape. May I ask where you got that?
You think I should come clean? What d'you think, you think I Should confess?
(passes cane from right to left and back a few times) But, see here. Right. Wrong. Right. Wrong. Right. Right. Wrong--
Oh, I'll pay. Half-price. Arrivederci my fellow 40-short.
But I'm backing in! You can't put it in head first!
Oh, yeah, me too, me too. Boy oh boy oh boy...! You know, in fact, I've been thinking about it, and I feel like I'm stealing from you! Five-hundred dollars! It's gonna be worth thousands soon! You know what? On second thought, I can't even accept it.
Well, you know... the friend meeting the new woman. I feel like I'm getting fixed up for a friendship.
(Still mad a Leslie) Never said goodbye. Goodbye!
Ah, excuse me. Do you have, uh, change of a dollar?
(Trying to whisper to Jerry) Look, we are gonna settle this right now! I demand reparations! I should get to sleep with Elaine. That's the only way to punish you!
Well, it's just, all you said was 'your welcome', which is nice. It's very nice. But... I feel I gotta get the apology.
You know what you oughta do. You should go to her office and heckle her.
I don't believe it, what did you say?
(Places the doll presumingly where it belongs on a shelf) Ya?
He just read it. (Russell vomits again. Jerry and George look ashamed.)
She's leaving me dirty messages on my answering machine.
I am not O'Brien! I am not O'Brien! I'm not O'Brien! Ask anyone! Jerry?! Jerry?!!
Oh! That's good judgment. That's a pile of judgment there. Sure.
Years. When we were kids, they made it seem like it was right around the corner.
(Sarcastic) Maybe for her new performance piece she'll give birth on stage.
(Apprehensively) Um. I just realized. Ya' never gave me back the change from the tolls.
(Pointing to them) Office Christmas gift. I tell you, this Human Fund is a gold mine!
(chuckles) Bye, thanks. (To Jerry, when Susan is far) I can't believe she took the money.
This is not good. World's are colliding! George is getting upset!
Well, I still don't know what I'm supposed to do. I don't even know what my assignment is.
I can't go in there. Im too uncomfortable.
(pointing to Jerry in joyous agreement) Ha-ha-hah. This is my lucky day.
What are you, Crazy? I can't ask the guy for more cigars after you burned down his cabin!
Im going to find out whats going on. All right?
You don't work in the rain? Your a mailman."Neither rain nor sleet nor snow....."It's the first one.
Well, I wish I could say the same, but I must say, with all due respect, I find it very hard to see the logic behind some of the moves you have made with this fine organization. In the past twenty years you have caused myself, and the city of New York, a good deal of distress, as we have watched you take our beloved Yankees and reduced them to a laughing stock, all for the glorification of your massive ego!
No no no, no mistake, no mistake. No, no , listen, we're going to get married over Christmas, I It doesn't make any difference to me. It's fine. Really.
Hunh, You know, it's the damnedest thing. I went out the window again to, to get a cup of coffee...
Hey, you know what else is playing here? ``Rochelle Rochelle''.
You know what? it's better than Elaine's, too. I gotta give her a call. (Moves tward the phone)
So what? Somebody dropped an egg on my head as I went into my building last night.
It's an inter-office envelope. It get passed around all over the office.
Yeah, my cleaning lady's Portuguese. I must've picked it up.
Ha ha. Everything's timed out to perfection, Jerry. Slippery Pete's got the Frogger running on battery power, the truck will be there any minute, and Kramer's taped out the loading zone.
Elaine, this pilot...it doesn't matter to me, it's not me I'm concerned about...it's my mother. I've been over to the hospital to see her...
(Looks at her) Yeah, uh, no menus. (Waves her off)
It's about the show. It... No, it was...
(suspicious) They haven't said anything to you, have they?
Hello, Ken. It's George Costanza. I think we need to talk.
but..why, it wasn't my fault, I .. you asked me a sandwich, I .. I make such delicious sandwiches Elaine
Uhm...Id like to ask you...ask you to analyze a hypothetical phone call, you know, from a female point of view.
Yes, well, you know, Im not thinking about the price. You know youre the only woman Ive never thought about the price. Get the lobster. I beg you to get the lobster. Go for the lobster.
Well, my father works for the United Volunteers, maybe he can get her one.
Alright, let's just examine the situation for a second. Who, in this situation, would be more likely to make a mistake? Me, who had access to my wallet, knew exactly what was in there? Or you--
(together -- with arms extended -- palms upwards) Stan The Caddy.
Well, it would be OK if Darryl was here.
Well there is traffic. It might take her till eight-fifteen.
No, that's right, I didn't. I take full responsibility for the card not being here. I, uh, . . .
Because, Jerry, it's a couple rule! We have to tell each other everything!
(Still on the hot water) What about shaving?
I think. (Pause as they all look down)
I never heard him say anything really funny.
Let's go, people, let's go! It's Prognosis Negative time, wa ha ha ha!!!
I think I like the girl better than the voice.
You go in the living room. I'll take the test in here.
Where? (He looks out window and gets hit by a tomato)
Yeah, and I - I heard you got on their good side. Now, what'd you do?
Well, why would the guy make up something like that? Of all the names he could pick, why settle on Jon Voight?
I'll tell you what, if pig-man shows up, we'll squeeze him in. I'll see you later.
My car's totaled. It's all his fault and now, he has absolutely no money. There is no way that he can pay me. So the judge decrees that he becomes my butler.
(Losing it) I guess everyone here enjoys giving the old screwgie, huh?! Youre all doin a hell of a job! (Looks longingly at the Twix in the machine) Ho, ho. What I would do with you..
Uh why don't you wait then go in the movies?
Oh, please. (to the teller) Can you change this into bills?
Wow,  god! You see this is all I think about. Sleeping with a giant. It's my life's ambition.
Why can't I have a heart attack? I'm allowed.
I DON'T KNOW. It's this place. I'm very uncomfortable here.
Yeah. Hmm. Boy these really do pinch. I tell you, if I ever find the son of a bitch that stole my glasses...
You know a lost and found could be a good idea.
Shut your traps and stop kicking the seats! We're trying to watch the movie! And if I have to tell you again, we're gonna take it outside and I'm gonna show you what it's like! You understand me? Now, shut your mouths or I'll shut 'em for ya, and if you think I'm kidding, just try me. Try me. Because I would love it!
Dark and disturbed? His whole life revolves around Superman and cereal. I convinced him to act like that so that you would think I was funnier. That's how disturbed I am! If you want disturbed, that's disturbed. You can't find sickness like that anywhere, you think sickness like that grows on trees? Nobody is sicker than me, nobody. He's pretending, I'm the genuine article.
(Interrupting) Anyway, I just wanted to let you know I'm really sorry that happened, and if I can help out in any way, I'll certainly be glad to do that. (Pause) Well, I guess that's about it.
Dad, that other car cut us off! They had swastikas all over it... They were hurling racial epiphates at us... I could have been killed!
Hey, there's a tomato stand, let's stop, I can get some more.
Well I guess that's because I wear boxer shorts.
All right. So, he caught me in a cleavage peek, so big deal. Who wouldn't look at his daughter's cleavage? She's got nice cleavage.
Ok. Good. And Kramer, you're in charge of taping off the loading zone.
Here. Let me take your tabe downstairs for you.
No, I'm not. I would like to be, but I'm not. What am I gonna do? The book club meets in a few days.
(as the others are repositioning the tables) No, no, you can't do that, they're round, it makes an 'eight' and, yeah, well alright.
Really? Because people do meet in places besides a bar, huh?
Oh, look, he's going to ask you about my arm. So, just tell him I banged it against a desk. And it's been moving involuntarily ever since.
Well I guess that's because I wear boxer shorts.
Yeah.. (Trying to remember) Poverotti.. Domingo.. and.. uh.. the other guy.
(to Kramer) It's a funeral procession. . . . (to Elaine) And I got news for you. I show up with Ring Dings and Pepsi, I become the biggest hit of the party. People be coming up to me, "just between you and me I'm really excited about the Ring Dings and the Pepsi. What are we, Europeans with the Beaujolais and Chardonnay . . .
So eh, you eh, wanna get together tomorrow?
Just take it off. I'm getting hot just looking at it.
Yeah. You could base a character on me.
Well, that's not offensive. (Reflects) It's abnormal, but it's not offensive.
I don't know, she said she had to pick up a friend of hers at the airport. It cost me a hundred dollars this ticket.
If you dont say anything I will assume its a plane crash.
Well, I am just a T-bone kinda guy. Love that T-bone. In fact, you might as well call me--
Pauline? . . . Wait a minute. I got it. My brother once impregnated a woman named Pauline.
(on phone  calling secretary) Hello Margery, George Costanza. How are you sweet heart? Listen, can you give Mr. Thomassoulo a message for me? Yes. If he needs me, tell him (screams) IM IN MY OFFICE! Thanks.
We just came from Chadway's(?) What's going on.
So let's say in her mind she witnessed a pick. Okay, so then what?
You know, I don't see how you can sit there eating that and not even offer me any?
Wait a minute, you were at a funeral, right?
Alright, I'll tell you the truth. I'm not gay. My name's Buck Naked, I'm a porno actor.
(feeling awkward) Its uh, not bad, its comin along. Why? Did you need something.
During that period when my folks were separated he went a little crazy.
You would think that at the end of the week when they hand out the checks, throw in a few soaps.
Let's see, How I'm very good at going in reverse in my car, why isn't Postum a more popular drink,
(urgent) Mr Wilhelm, listen. You've been abducted! Please, Mr Wilhelm, you gotta listen to me!
I was moving it across the street, I looked up and I saw Woody Allen and I got all distracted.
I bet they're probably doing summersaults about us over there. You think they get butler stories like that everyday? (He calls Susan)
Yeah, yeah I really had some guts back then. Why don't we do it again?
So we started drinking, and I'll tell you I don't know if it was the alcohol or the ammonia, but the next think I knew she was mopping the floor with me.
No, not really. I'm just saying this to you because I like to hear myself talk. Yes, really!
(Gets up to leave) Well, scintillating as always.
(shouts) Wait! Yes! That's what I should've said! (frustration) D'ohh!
Was this something you had planned for a while?
He's an obscure writer. Betnik, on the village.
Look, I really appreciate your coming, but if you wouldn't mind - try not to say too much.
I tell you, I really don't think so-called relationship humor is what this show is all about.
And why shouldn't you? Be fresh Stay fresh
Well, if she was a criminal and you had to describe her to a police sketch artist...
Boy! What a story! I'm speechless. Speechless. I have no speech.
Oh, so now I have to buy this whole chair by myself?
(a little worried) He uh, he doesn't have the auto shop any more?
Excuse me sir. Would you mind watching my bag for a minute?
Alright, fine.I'll drive the 3 hours each way, 6 hours all together, and take 'em off myself!!
Hey pop, would you buzz off, I've got something cooking.
Because, if I'm looking straight ahead, and something enters my field of vision, that's merely a happenstance. (Elaine loudly snaps and unfolds her napkin at the next table to get Russell's attention.)
You don't know what that spot means to him. Once he gets it, he doesn't go out for weeks.
Oh, see? that's why I don't have cable in my house. Because of that naked station. If I had that in my house, I would never turn it off. I wouldn't sleep, I wouldn't eat. Eventually, firemen would have to break through the door, they'd find me sitting there in my pajamas with drool coming down my face. All right, all right. So you're watching the naked station.
Ah, great. All right, with the wine I'm in over twenty dollars now.
Are you kidding? People get spaces this good, they never give em up.
Tell me your impressions, I would love to hear what a young woman thinks of "The Big Game".
Oh, that's too bad. I kinda wanted to meet him, seeing as how we look so similar.
I'm going out with her tomorrow, she said she had some errands to run.
Toasting makes me uncomfortable. But toast, I love. Never start the day without a good piece of toast. In fact, let's toast to toast.
And I cancelled plans to go to the movies with them tonight.
I don't know. He can be so weird sometimes.
No, no, no, no, Im It. I win.
Um, you know Im starting to think that maybe lobster isnt the way to go.
Yeah, that's exactly what I'm worried about. God would never let me be successful. He'd kill me first. He'd never let me be happy.
And then in the fifth inning, why did you take off on the pop fly?
Let me just see it for a second.
No. Why must it be so difficult? Why is there all this tension and hostility? Why can't I just walk up to a woman on the street and say, "Hi. I'm
Oh no no no. He's deeply in love, and I was just about to break up with her when she told me.
(Talking about his would-be apartment) You could fit 15 people in that bathroom..
No, No! She's going out with a friend of mine. It's only courteous that we should try and like each other.
(takes a large bite - with his mouth still full, his speech is muffled) Oh, this is fabulous.
You're right, how did I miss that? (Begins unlocking the door, mutters under his breath) Maybe because it's a crock of shit.
Almost. Couldn't get the girl go out with me the second time.
Listen I was talking to Elaine today and she said she'd would really like to be an usher at the wedding
Well, how good a look did you get?
(In a state of hysteria) I'm an eggplant! I'm an eggplant! I'm a minstrel man!
Great move, telling him, by the way, real smart move.
Yes he is. Let me ask you something. When you come out of the shower and you put your robe on, do you cinch it real tight, are you concerned about that?
(Somewhat stern) Oh, the thing's cancelled. Sit down.
So, you send me to this therapist to help me with my emotional disorders, and she criticizes our script. (Tosses the script to Jerry.) What kind of a therapist is that?
No! (The salesman walks away. He addresses the mechanic through the doors window) Hey! Hey! I see you! That is my Twix! (The mechanic eats the last of the Twix, obviously to make George even more angered. It works) Oh, ha, ha! Ho, ho!
Ben Cantwell. 85. Huh... You think we'll make it to that age?
(laughing it off and trying too hard) Yeah, yeah. I have a thing for Marisa Tomei. Like she would ever go out with a short, stocky, bald man. (forced laughter) Hu hu, ha ha. Like that's her type. Huh. She's an Oscar winner. (nervous laughter) He heh. Besides, I don't even know her. It's not like anyone's trying to fix us up. Who, who would try and fix me up with Marisa Tomei?
When I asked him if it was cancer, he didn't give me a "get outta here". That's what I wanted to hear "Cancer? Get outta here?"
I got it. Cups in the front, loops in the back. (puts the bra on the table)
(on tape, singing) "Believe it or not, George, isn't at home, please leave a mes-saaage at the beep. I must be out or I'd pick up the pho-one. Where could I be? Believe it or not, I'm not hooome." (beep)
Helping people... Of course. Of course! It makes perfect sense! How could I *not* be doing this!? I am gonna help somebody, Dammit!
Someday, before I die, mark my words - I'm gonna tell that woman exactly what I think of her. I'll never be able to forgive myself until I do.
Pretty chintzy, huh? Considering the money she makes.. She's a big executive for Federal Express.
Well then...then you really have something to think about because.....you know if there's any doubt in your mind ....and.. and,, it doesn't even have to be a big doubt, you know even a tiny doubt, a DOT of a doubt.. and.....
Alright, now. What mood am I in, what mood am I in?
Can I ask you a question? Would you mind switching seats?
Is that right? I just threw away a lifetime of guilt-free sex, and floor seats for ever sporting event in Madison Square Garden. So please, a little respect. For I am Costanza Lord of the Idiots!
What is that? Its ridiculous! You dont even know what hotel shes staying at, you cant call her. Thats a signal, Jerry, thats a signal! (snaps his fingers) Signal!
(really animated) Alright, alright. You see? This is why I hate writing with a large group. Everybody has their own little opinions, and it all gets homogenised, and you lose the whole edge of it. I'm going with jerk store! Jerk store is the line! Jerk store! Yess!
Yeah, well you have to maintain the same disposition too. You can't start acting any differently. You have to be nice.
I know that's why I bought `em but they're not comfortable.
So you really understand my point about building a rocket and double-parking.
And people come in the store and you get involved in their lives.
I think he's saying 'Son of Sam'! Oh, my God!
All right, I made up the part about the car, but the rest is true. And he hated me anyway!
(clearing his throat, he changes his order for Susan) Baked, uh, potato.
This is by far the most exciting thing I've ever done.
Uh, excuse me. Uh, pound of Arabian mocha java, please.
But your life is Peterman's. Now the bus tour, which is real, takes to places that, while they are real, they are not real in sense that they did not *really* happen to the *real* Peterman which is you.
You know you buy a big salad for somebody it would be nice if they knew it.
Of course, not as exciting as miss crop circles, but...
Oh, you're fine... you're fine. (looking at Tom in the back and then quieter to Jerry) So you think this guy playing Kramer took the raisins?
All right, he's letting you in. Thank you! Creep.
Hey, Lloyd. (Shakes hands with Lloyd) How's it going? (chuckles)
Hey! Great plane! Thanks a lot. Piece of junk. You know you almost got us killed!
Hey, you know, we haven't brought the Elaine character into the show yet. Umm, We should try and get her into this scene.
I know, I know...don't skimp. Go go go go...
Good afternoon. One large crab bisque to go. Bread. Beautiful.
(hangs up the phone) That's my toaster. I got to go. Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh!
(incredulous) You can't ground me, I'm a grown man.
(to the cashier) Excuse me, I gave you a twenty dollar bill and you only actually gave me change for a ten.
(singing)  Master of the house/Keeper of the inn... (Jerry re-enters the living room and modestly models his new jacket for George. George is impressed.) This is huge! When did this happen?
Would you stop that? It's not safe to be jumping up and down on a plane.
Hey look a that - boy are you lucky - another great spot - right in front of the hospital. In an emergency yet! How lucky are you huh? Is that unbelievable? How unbelievable is that huh? Come on, give it to me, give it to me.
(picking up what Frank saw as a mouse) It's the remote.
See, look at this. (wearing a very tight shirt) Rachel, my T-shirt shrunk. It used to be much bigger, and now it shrunk. You see, that's what water does. It shrinks things.
Yes, and I'm speaking at a men's' conference.
(still on the phone) All right fine.... Whatever
Well, I was buttering myself up for a nice shave --
What's the matter with you? Are you crazy? Why are you using my name?!
Good. Cause if this is a lie, if this is a joke, if this is your idea of some cute little game we're finished!
(Wanting Elaine to take it off his hands, he tries to silence Jerry) Jerry, simmer down.
No, not a racial thing, there really is a resemblance...
What are you doing here? I thought you said you hated Isabella's?
How's this for criticism? Um...you stink. How do like that criticism? You know what's funny to me? That diploma up on the wall. That is my idea of "com-med-dee"! You sitting here, telling people what to do.
God! She's cooking dinner for God! She's yelling and screaming, and the next thing I know, she throws a big can of chocolate syrup all over my new red shirt.
(to Jerry) What do you mean by that?
Oh no, in and out, I made sure of that. And you'll be happy to know I perused the script and it's met with my approval.
(explaining, with lots of hand gestures) Okay, look. We've never worked together on a lie. Now, you don't understand how I work. I have a certain way of working. Jerry and I have worked together a few times. He knows how I work. It's not a personal thing, y'know? We're just trying to come up with the best possible lie. That's what this is all about.
(Laughs) Steven, nothing is higher than an architect.
Okay. "Breakfast At Tiffany's." (Begins to read, but gradually his attention is drawn to the TV Guide on the end table. George realizes there's a show on he wants to see by looking at his watch, and doesn't start the book.)
There was an incident. I'd rather not discuss it.
(Starting to panic again) What? Oh my God. What? Is it meningitis? Scoliosis? Lupis?! Is it Lupis?!
I didn't do it! It..It just got done. I don't know how it got done, but it did.
She's working late that night. We're - were supposed to have dinner with everybody at eight o'clock so I'll set up the ride for seven o'clock.
If youre having second thoughts, if you didnt want it, dont worry about it because uh, you know, I, I...I could take it, you know.
By the way, you owe me seven fifty.
(Losing it) Don't tell me how to eat!
Yeah. Hey, wait a second, you know, good news for you too. Susan's best friend, Hallie? Broke up with her boyfriend.
No no no, he's not getting away with this.
They will get a good home won't they?
(tormented) Aw, shut up Jerry! Just shut up!
Why did it all turn out like this for me? I had so much promise. I was personable, I was bright. (Elaine turns showing disagreement) Oh, maybe not academically speaking, (Elaine nods correct) I was perceptive. I always know when someone's uncomfortable at a party.
All right, all right. Thats it. Im gonna go down there.
(Heavily sarcastic. He's angered at Jerry) Good one. Very funny. You're very funny, Jerry. That's what I always tell people. (Yelling out) Jerry Seinfeld's a funny guy!
It was very traumatic. The last thing I remember is you flinching. Then, everything went black.
I guarantee you that Moses was a picker. You wander throughh the desert for forty years with that dry air. ... You telling me you're not going to have occasion to clean house a little bit.
You're not really gonna go to California, are you?
And ah, Ill have the bacon club without the turkey. (raises eyebrows)
Why don't you call her agency. Maybe she's been out of town and she didn't get the calls.
So he... had his hands and, uh, he was uh
Do you realize in the entire history of western civilization no one has successfully accomplished the Roommate Switch? In the Middle Ages you could get locked up for even suggesting it!
Would it kill him to check up on us? No - drops off the meals and that's it. I realize we're prisoners, but we're still entitled to catsup.
I want to know how did that get into my car?
Hello? Amanda. Hi, yes. Listen. You know, I'm thinkin', we might just be better of bein' friends. Yeah. Yeah, you know what, I can't even really talk about it right now. Bye-bye. (hangs up) (happy with himself, but then sees the burned up photo) No! No!
Because my cousin's imbecile dog was rolling around outside and they got in his carpet.
What, are you crazy? I can't have a man touching me. Switch with me.
Well, here you go. What do you think?
No, I did not! (They exit the coffee shop.)
What am I going to do now? I can't live without Susan. I gotta get her back. How? How, am I gonna get her back?
Why don't they have salsa on the table?
Oh I beg to differ. My father took great pride in his appearance, he was a very handsome man, a casanova really.
That's my whole afternoon! I was going to look for sneakers.
What, did you go swimmin'? It's 29 degrees out!
Oh, yeah. I read what you said to the papers yesterday. You weren't in on the planing. What planning? YOU THINK WE PLANED THIS? Uh?
Ok, we got your...got your strawberries, your chocolate sauce, your pastrami on rye with mustard, your honey...
All my life I've dreamed of sitting front row, behind the dugout!
(Threatening) Hold it! One more step and were walkin!
Well, you know, it's really very funny, because you know what we got here, really? We really, really, just have a terrible misunderstanding. You see, when I passed on the deal, I thought that's what Jerry wanted me to say. Y'know, I, I misinterpreted.
A few days go by and a call is placed at a time when Sandy is known to be busy at work. Once the initial awkwardness is relieved with a little playful humor, which she [Laura] of course cannot resist, an invitation to a friendly dinner is proffered.
I feel like I got a B12 shot. This is like a taste explosion!
I dont understand why you spend time with this guy.
(PULLING OUT ESTIMATE OUT OF HIS POCKET) Well, profit. I think you'll see from the estimate that I'm not really profiting that much. They might be a little high, but..
(inhales deeply) I tell you, Jerry, I'm feeling something. Something I haven't felt in a long time.
It strikes me a lot of guys are doing that kind of humor now.
Not me. Everything should be negotiable. (he picks up a container of fruit)
Why? Because we're a team! C'mon! Would you take this for us, dear? Thank you very much. Here we go... (To Morgan) Anyone ever tell you you look a lot like Sugar Ray Leonard? Yeah, you must get that all the time.
She said "sweep together" you idiots, not "sleep together."
I knew I had hit my high note so I thanked the crowd and I was gone.
So she doesn't want to see me anymore.
Ah ha, well, I really wouldn't know about that. I don't watch much TV. I like to read. So what do you do, a lot of that "did you ever notice?" this kind of stuff.
Why did the policeman have to yell at me like that? (Elaine enters)
I'm engaged to Mr. Ross' niece. I'm probably gonna be taking over this whole place someday so if I were you I would stay on my good side.
Susan B. Anthony** I think I'd have a problem with.
You know what I've come to realize? I'm not just bored. I genuinely dislike her.
huh Kramer it's huh.. gonna be pretty dangerous up there
Oh yeah, real cool. You're a cool guy.
I can't carry a pen. I'm afraid I'll puncture my scrotum.
I dont know whatcha had to tell her that for. You put me in a very difficult position, Marine Biologist! I'm very uncomfortable with this whole thing.
(Muttering) Susan has the doll collection.. one of the dolls looks exactly like my mother.. she likes to sleep with it.
Hey, I know what I'm talking about. I gotta be honest with you, I gotta tell ya... Ever since I saw you holding hands with that woman, I can't get you out of my mind.
Oh, I can't believe you're dropping out, too. So now Kramer and I have to pay for the entire gift?
You know, like the general manager of a baseball team or something.
Phil, I loved those cigars! Incoming! (Flicks his card tward Phil)
No, that's a fair question. It is, uhm... (nervous chuckle) Jerry, yeah. (to Cynthia) Jerry's a friend of mine. (to Russell) He uh, he gave it to me. Unbelievable how many addresses of people this guy has.
No wait, you can't just leave me here! Will I see you again?
You should see what my father used to go through before he bought a car. He'd go from state to state. He was away for weeks at a time. It was like he was running for President and he was going through the primaries. We'd get phone calls from motels in New Hampshire.
It's all departures. I see nothing but departures. (to the woman beside him) Do you know where the arrivals are?
I'm telling you, that cashier is riding horses on my money.
Hey, I'm sorry, you had your buffer zone for many years. It's my turn to live, baby.
The second time I sent the noodles back, I tought she made a face...
She just dislikes me so much... It's irresistable.
He's a jerk. (nudges to his right but no one is there)
(standing up, still acting) Uhh! I'm caught in my own web of lies! (holds his hands up in surrender)
I don't want hope. Hope is killing me. My dream is to become hopeless. When you're hopeless, you don't care, and when you don't care, that indifference makes you attractive.
Heh, haa. And that's no good. I've tried it straight, Jerry. We've all seen the results. For me, sick is the only way to go.
(Holding his drink up to his mouth) Oh my gosh, I just had a great idea. She could come to the party tomorrow and read Gwen's lips for me.
Yeah, no pop-in, no "in the neighborhood," no "I saw your light was on." And the best part is, if things go really well...
Could you make it two-twenty-five that was his hi-game in bowling.
(in the threshold between the living room and the kitchen) The thing that bothers me the most, is the lying.
Is-is that what I said 'no story'? Because Jerry had to tell me later.
Y'know if the guy dies, the art could really be worth something...
You should be the one criticizing me. I, I'm lucky to even know someone like you.
Yeah, like I'm going to risk my job with the New York Yankees to make a few extra bucks. (winks)
Das kaffes un salat e grand por favor.
I don't even like to sit next to a man on an airplane 'cause our knees might touch.
Yes, yes, you know I was in detention and she came up behind me while I was erasing the blackboard . . .
Well I think it would be nice if there was some kind of historical record of it.
You wanna see?! (pulling off the hat to reveal the bald pate) There! There it is! (turning to Newman) Alright, here! You wanna try on the hat?! Here! Try on the hat!
No problem there. Conformity is an obsession with me.
That's right, you heard me. Get out! You are ruining this whole experience for me!
(horrified) But that meeting starts in ten minutes!
On-the-street cell-phone call is the lowest phone call you can make.
Ah, this is the kind of day that almost makes you feel good to be alive.
Hold on. Hold on. Wait a minute. How am I gonna get the rye bread into the apartment?
All I know is I've been going to doctors all my life. What has it gotten me? I'm thirty-three years old. I haven't outgrown the problems of puberty, I'm already facing the problems of old age. I completely skipped healthy adulthood. I went from having orgasms immediately to taking forever. You could do your taxes in the time it takes me to have an orgasm. I've never had a normal, medium orgasm.
No, no. No, no, no. It was not trash!
Lemme tell you something, that Jerry Lewis? You wonder how some of these people get to the top? It's ideas like this! Brilliant! Hah-hah! (Notices that the briefcase is damaged.) Look at this - what the hell happened? The whole side is damaged here...and the lock is broken.
You hear the way he talks to me?
The whole hour just flew by. (laughs - hehe) (Begins cleaning up the table.)
Well, sorry I missed that, uh, charity thing. But this was one of those truly glorious Hampton weekends that you always hear about.
What do think I tell Jerry everything? It's not like he's my wife.
What are we gonna do? How are we gonna get out of here?
Lemme tell you sum'in. When Ponce looked in that mirror and saw that he hadn't changed, and that tear started to roll down his cheek? ... I lost it.
Nothing, why? You think something's wrong? Am I different?
...It was all a terrible misunderstanding, sir. Just five minutes. Just five minutes of your time. (listens) Thank you! Thank you, Mister Dalrimple.
Because! Because, as the leader...if I die...then all hope is lost! Who would lead? The clown? Instead of castigating me, you should all be thanking me. What kind of a topsy-turvy world do we live in, where-where heroes are cast as villains? Brave men as cowards?
Yeah, you're right, you're right. (To Elaine) Alright, maybe he's not interested, but you still know him - can't you just ask him?
Summer of '89 I'm at the beach. This family sits up next to me. I go in to the surfs and when I come from out, my clothes, my towel, my umbrella, they're all gone. I am furious, I start screaming to these kids demanding my stuff back and finally I lose it; I grab their boom box and I chuck it in to the ocean.
Oh, sports are so pedestrian. I've prepared some science experiments that will illuminate the mind and dazzle the eye.
All right. So, you hold out your money, speak your soup in a loud, clear voice, step to the left and receive.
I still won't be able to forgive myself - but at least it won't be about this.
And, um, it was quite good. In fact, you even incorporated me into the show. I'm not actually a performer. Although, my parents felt I had talent..
Oh, of course. (motioning Estelle to enter) Of course.
Well, we would like to be in business. Let's do business. We'll have some business. Let's have business.
"Ah! your just mad 'cause we beat ya."
I know who it was too. It was the guy who interviewed me. He was very threatened by me. Why else wouldn't he hire me? I could sell latex like that (snaps fingers).
