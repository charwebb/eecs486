Right. (Mumbles) Nastercoff.. What country is he from, again?
(resentfully dampened) It's not a prom. It's a Ball.
Well, I like a rolling writer. They're very smooth.
(Defensively loud) It was when I was banging!
I dont know. Just start scratching. Tell him you have the crabs. He was in the military. Hell understand that.
(frustrated) Fine. Fine. (to customer) Excuse me. (heading for the door) Think I'm gonna forget about this? I haven't forgotten about this. I don't forget that easily!
What are you worried about, you know it.
Is that right? I just threw away a lifetime of guilt-free sex, and floor seats for ever sporting event in Madison Square Garden. So please, a little respect. For I am Costanza Lord of the Idiots!
I still don't see why you wouldn't eat me. I'm your best friend.
For a mental patient. Wait a minute, the phone, we'll call the police.
Fabulous, I'll think about that George, thank you!
No, you're gonna sit down, you son of a gun...
Oh no no no. He's deeply in love, and I was just about to break up with her when she told me.
(Puts his arms in the air, stretching, and covers his mouth with an arm) Could you ask her, just ask her. If she says no, case closed.
The attic? Y-you haven't wore any of those clothes for years.
You be nice! He's giving me a parking space (echoes) parking space... parking space...
I am not O'Brien! I am not O'Brien! I'm not O'Brien! Ask anyone! Jerry?! Jerry?!!
Hey. How come I didn't get a Christmas card? Everybody else got one. Jerry got one, Kramer got one. I thought we were good friends. I don't get a Christmas card. I don't get it.
Ohooo what are we going to do? I'm shaking! I'm shaking!
Oh now you're gonna go? ELAINE I'll be back in five minutes.
Well, sir, I - I gave out the fake card, because, um, I don't really celebrate Christmas. I, um, I celebrate Festivus.
That's perfect! He's a zoo guy! He take's care of animals. C-Can I bring the squirrel by?
Hmm, what's he doin' in the city today?
(seeing Jerry's van shaking) What is that? That van's a-rockin'.
No. Youd be surprised. You dont recover that quickly from a nose job.
Yeah, well when you don't actually do the steps, you can go through them pretty quick. You can get through six a day.
Wednesday? That's your personal business?! (stalks over to the counter) Skiing?! (angry) So let people suffer, while you're shushing all over a mountain?
It moved! It was imperceptible but I-I felt it.
Yeah, yeah. I've heard that. Meanwhile I'm here with you in a parking garage, what am I supposed to do?
Oh, I dont get the enthusiastic hi, Im outta there.
Yeah, I told her to call me here and to tell anyone who answers the phone to ask for a balding, stocky man with glasses. I better tell him I'm expecting a call.
Well what's in this giant box out in the hall?
Get a good night's sleep, alright fellas. (thumbs up) Big day tomorrow!
Alright, what's the difference. What are we gonna do now? He won't take our calls, we can't get into his office...
Oh no, you're not going out on a high note with me Mr. Kruger!
Well, I gotta go back there and try again. Hi Sheila.
(Opens the door, looks in and then knocks 5 times) Mr. Steinbrenner, (waves) can I talk to you for a second?
There could be more than one O'Brien on a plane who ordered a limo.
There putting in a lost and found because of me. There's a time limit but still.
Yeah, yeah. Speaking of crazy, did you hear about Lloyd Braun?
Oh, no, not just me, the whole organization. Especially Mr. Morgan.
Ah you have no idea of the magnitude of this thing. If she is allowed to infiltrate this world, then George Costanza as you know him, Ceases to Exist! You see, right now, I have Relationship George, but there is also Independent George. That's the George you know, the George you grew up with -- Movie George, Coffee shop George, Liar George, Bawdy George.
Hehe. Well, I got my triangles. (sitting on the couch)
Or maybe, she just wanted to go to the Tony's. I tell you what; you ask her out again. No Tony, just Jerry. That way you know it he was her dude or just some dude.
(coyly, he looks down and runs his finger along the top of the chair back in front of him) Do you, uh ... do you know what Im ... thinking about now?
Would you wait a second? Just wait? (They fight over it.)
Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot. I'll pay you back.
No, I would have picked up on it. I can always tell when a woman likes me, they always somehow let you know. With me, they could torture me, I wouldn't tell them. If anything I'd try to make them think I don't like them, then they think, "Oh, look at this guy, he's not even looking at me, he must have something going for him."
They're -- They're killing independent George! And they're, they're all in on it! World's are colliding!
Yes. Live, dammit. Live! Every precious moment as if this was the last year of your life. Because in many ways...it is. (There's a knock at the door.) Excuse me.
No, it hit the table, it hit the table.
Well, wha-what about the toe? What happened to the toe?
...you'll see, things will be different now - if you just give me one more chance.
I don't have a spare set. All my keys say 'do not duplicate'.
I know, I know, I can't stop it!
I don't know. I don't think you're anything.
Hey, hey hey. Don't worry about me. I'm not a waffler. I don't waffle!
(urgent) Mr Wilhelm, listen. You've been abducted! Please, Mr Wilhelm, you gotta listen to me!
Monica, I'm really focused here, this stuff's a killer. (turns to the next page)
So, he made an appointment for me to see Dinkins' doctor. He's just trying to humiliate me.
(Gets up to leave) Well, scintillating as always.
Huh. (Makes a "over his head" gesture with his arm) C'mon, let's go, go. We got a lot of work to do today.
I didn't know you were such a Bette Midler fan.
Alright, I gotta go home and open up with the house for the carpet cleaners. You know they're doing my whole place for twenty-five dollars.
(Apprehensively) Um. I just realized. Ya' never gave me back the change from the tolls.
Yeah, yeah. Shes punctual... and uh shes been late, sometimes.
If my parents had a mantel, I might be a completely different person.
Now, each of you is here because you're the best at what you do.
All right, look--wait--wait--Krama--wait, wait a minute, you are not. You are not goin' in. Ah-ahhh!
I saw "Titanic". So that old woman, she's just a liar, right?
Ok uh, I guess I'll tell them that.
uh, Uh, Vandelay Industries, is uh. 129 West 81st street. It's a very small industry Vandelay. It's one of the reasons I wanted to uh, work for them.
Well I, uh, I'm not sure how you pronounce it or anything, but I, uh, I believe it's Mnage  Trois?
Oh, sure. Of course. (looks for place to set down flowers) Um, uh, could you hold these? For just a second, just a second. (grabs newspapers from trash bin, begins wiping windshield) Here you go, now don't worry about a thing. It's gonna be fine. Here we go. Look at this shine.
I dont know. I cant believe theyre making me take this test.
We gotta get something. I don't want to go to that meeting on an empty stomach. Let's get some Chinese. You wanna order it?
Really? Because people do meet in places besides a bar, huh?
Fragile Frankie Merman? I never liked that guy.
Yes, flowers. I will get her flowers, I will go to the florist!
Oh, this is good. This Kruger guy is clueless. I can't wait to work for him.
I thought I saw something fly over here...
Wait a second. Think about it. He's not showing up. Wait till you see the line of cabs, its like forty-five minutes long. You said he's in Chicago.
Yeah. I love Hampton tomatoes. You know, you can eat 'em like apples. You know it's funny, the tomato never really took on as a hand fruit.
I feel like I'm in bed with my mother.
Oh you can stuff your sorries in a sack, Mister!
What could I do? Did you see the mug on that kid?
This is nighmare. Kramer how long was I on?
Yeah, yeah, and we started talking, and she's this lawyer who's incredible! Everything I said was funny! You know, she laughed at everything I said, she thinks I'm hilarious. You know in a way, it was almost too good. I started so good, I can't go any place but down now, ya know? I got no place to go.
Wait a minute, Rinitze? Don't they have somme really cool suits in there?
No, that's not enough BTUs for my living room...That was a complete waste of time.
Yeah, yeah, me to miss -- I miss.
Oh yeah. So wait, wait. A half-hour later Im back in the office, I tell Lloyd the whole story. He says, So why dont you call her? I says, I cant. I couldnt, I couldnt do it right then. For me to ask a woman out I gotta get into a mental state like the karate guys before they break the bricks. So Lloyd calls me a wuss.
I mean, we're not stupid, right? We know when something's funny!
Alright, just make sure he reserves the good chair for me. Wait, what are you gonna tell him about the clanking noise in the car?
Well, whoever he was, he knew a lot about The A-Team!
Im aware of you. (to Jerry) All right, lets go (opens the bathroom door) Lets go!
You have any idea how fast these things deteriorate when there's an 'I love you' out of the bag? You can't have a relationship where one person says, "I love you", and the other says, "I'm hungry. Let's get something to eat.".
(Leaving) I'll store these over at Kramer's apartment.
C'mon, c'mon...(stands up and physically rolls Betsy to the left side of the couch.) See, now, is that so bad?
I'm gonna read a book. From beginning to end. In that order.
(to the cashier) Excuse me, I gave you a twenty dollar bill and you only actually gave me change for a ten.
Let me tell you who did, uh, buy it...um we pitched this story to Russell Dalrymple, the president of NBC, and he ate it up with a spoon.
Maybe she moved it up in the rotation.
Well I am. Couldn't you try to go through some of that stuff I put in your shoebox?
Okay. Hey, you know what, maybe I should give it to my therapist to read. She's smart, I trust her.
Alright, so that's one tuck and one no-tuck.
So, let me ask you. Do you think I could have done this?
I know who it was too. It was the guy who interviewed me. He was very threatened by me. Why else wouldn't he hire me? I could sell latex like that (snaps fingers).
I think I'll have a piece of cake.
I know, but don't say anything to anyone. He told me not to tell you.
No one hails a cab like me. My hailing technique is unmatched. I get the wrist going from side to side and boom! Cabs are crashing into themselves to just pick me up. (a cab stops) All right, here we go. Let me get door. Feminists aside, I know women like the door holding. Here we are all righty. O.K. Jodi let's get together again real soon and say hello to your sister for me.
You're in the movie? Is he in the scene?
I am eating my dessert. How do you eat it, with your hands?
You know, we could go uptown, and that way we could give Jerry a ride home.
Oh, no no no no. Go ahead, Pop, you always knew your cars.
Well, if it's as good as ``Ponce de Leon'', I'll be happy.
(thinking of the moans) Heh. (Karen takes another puff of her cigarette) You seem like you really enjoyed your Risotto. (chuckles) You have a very contented air over there. (chuckles again) You look very contented, very satisfied. (pauses) Are you satisfied?
Uh, let me ask you something. You uh, you ever hear of Marisa Tomei?
(talking to nobody) Nah. It's probably a union thing.
What's it gonna be? ... You hear that?
Yea, ya..ya know I feel terrible about Joey but it's jus..it's a great business opportunity. I-I don't even know how long I'm gonna be away for.
What big salad? I'm going to the coffee shop.
So, you know, she calls and says she wants to go out with you tomorrow night? God bless! Devil you!
Shut your traps and stop kicking the seats! We're trying to watch the movie! And if I have to tell you again, we're gonna take it outside and I'm gonna show you what it's like! You understand me? Now, shut your mouths or I'll shut 'em for ya, and if you think I'm kidding, just try me. Try me. Because I would love it!
(Reflecting on his life gone wrong) This McKigney guy had a few good years.. (To Kramer, bitter) How could you forget to turn off an iron?
(singing; imitating Tony Bennett) You know, Id go from nods to nothing...
9... 1... 1. She said she'd do anything. Hello, police? Uh, yeah listen, we're in the back of a limo in Queens--
(still looking at that picture) You know if I told my engagement story to that receptionist, but told her this, was my fiance..
Yeah, my wife couldnt make it today. Shes got something with her mother... Who knows whats going on with her. Dont let any one kid you, its tough.
Jerry ... Where are you? I know you like to sit back here. Elaine! Susan!
Im outta there. I did it! Its over.
You're not really gonna go to California, are you?
Uh, anyway, (Waving bye to everyone) onward and upward.
An' wait'll you see the dress that she's got. It's backless! Uh?! I'm finally gonna make a Great Entrance!
I'm wearin' a little hat, I'm jumpin' through fire.. They're puttin' their little alien heads in my mouth..
Yeah,yeah!! I'll pick you up right now.....All right All right....Hey! gotta go.
What's going on? He still wants to have dinner with us?
You couldn't figure out the World's Theory for yourself? It's just common sense. Anybody knows, ya gotta keep your worlds apart. (gesturing with hands going outward)
Yep. Classic horseshoe pattern. I've seen a lot of this.
You know, like the general manager of a baseball team or something.
All right, enough! Enough! From now on, no more yada yada's. Just give me the full story.
(starts to try to get passed Jerry and Elaine) Alright get out of my way. (Jerry and Elaine push him back, George very annoyed) Alright don't make me get physical here!
Listen, maybe we shouldn't start writing today. I got a lot on my mind.
She didn't want to come, she-she's not really into sports.
I don't know of this is the house. I don't see Jerry's car anywhere.
You're Murphy!! Look, let's just jump out of the car.
I can't eat with you leanin' over like this. Just look straight forward.
Hey, you gotta take a ride with me later. I borrowed my father's car. '68 GTO.
I might tell her that I love her. I came this close last night, then I just chickened out.
Me too, really. Unless you'd really like to get one.
What are you comparing yourself to Keith Hernandez. The guys a baseball player Jerry, Baseball!
You know they used to make leisure suits out of this fabric?
Ah! Health's not good enough. I want more than health. Health's not doing it for me anymore. I'm sick of health.
Oh...uh, because if it had anything at all to do with what you perceived as me leering at your daughter, I really have to take issue with that. I did not leer. (To Jerry) Did I leer?
The name's George Constanza. I'm starting work here today. I was wondering if you could tell me where my office is.
I think I may be in love with this woman.
So the Wig master.......the Wig master said you could stop by the theater tonight.. and he'll show you around.
Huh, nggh [snort] Stop. (flirting with her he playfully hits her arm with the menu, then flicks it into the air)
I don't know how a fish could eat laughs.
(singing) Master of the House/Quick to catch your eye/Never wants a passerby to pass him by...
(Putting his jacket on) I'd like to apologize. I want to tell him I.. I.. didn't mean to get him in trouble.
(hearing Elaine over the phone) What, she's out?
Why did you give him my ticket for?
Thats why, you know, a shake is bad.
I was quoting him. Why would I be insulted? I'm never insulted. You could call me baldy, dump soup on my head. Nothing insults me.
Pulp can move, Baby! Why didn't you eat a real breakfast?
What if I want to walk around a little?
I told her I was out o' soda, I went out to get some, an' I never went back.
I know it may sound shocking. But, I just can't stop myself from... wanting you.
He wouldn't put it on if he didn't like it.
We cant just let him get away with this.
Ah, ...A beautiful successful intelligent woman's in love with me and I throw it all away. uh oh boy. Now I'll spend the rest of my life living alone. I'll sit in my disgusting little apartment watching basketball games, eating Chinese take out. Walking around with no underwear. Because I'm too lazy to do a laundry.
(pointedly) Oh, I'm sorry, I require twenty-four hours notice for a cancellation. Now, as I see it, you owe me seventy-five dollars.
(Slowly shakes his head) My mother caught me.
Don't you see how wrong that is?! Where's your Christmas spirit? And eye for an eye!
Uh, excuse me, uh, um, Jason. I don't want to get into a big thing here, but... I'm not sure if, technically, what you just said was actually an apology.
(crying from the onion) You'll see I'm right.
Hey Elaine? Put me down for some of that art. 1,900 dollars worth.
That's where I come in. Umm, on splat. Uh, you see, Mrs. Sweedler, or is it hospital administrator Sweedler?
Jerry, I'm trapped under my desk. Steinbrenner is in the room. You got to help[ me.
Maybe it's some small thing I could change. Like a moustache. Or wearing a top hat, or a monocle, or a..or a cane.
(Anyway,) on the left--exquisite marble! High ceilings. An' a flush, like a jet engine! (imitates sound) Ha ha!
What! There's no signs here! This is an outrage!
Yeah! Yeah!..Staten Island . What about my clothes ,how do I get the rest of the clothes?
(pointing to Jerry in joyous agreement) Ha-ha-hah. This is my lucky day.
(to Jay) What do you think it is?
I mean you're just, you're just a marvel of organization.
No-no-no, Kramer. Kramer! Kramer! You *cannot* abandon people in the middle of an airport pickup! It's a binding social contract. We... we must go forward... not back.
You can stuff your sorries in a sack, mister!
Well, some of 'em look good. The ones that look good you don't even know about.
So what? What am I supposed to do?
All right. You understand now? It's not that complicated.
Hi (raises his left hand in a slight gesture to say hi)
Are there terrorists on the plane? A hotel fire. Is that it? Malaria? Yellow fever? Lupus? Is it Lupus?
Take care. Take it easy. (Tom leaves with the casting director)
(anxious) I forgot who I am! Who am I?!
Yeah, well I'm thinking about getting out of town with Susan for a few days....Her parents rebuilt the cabin!
I go in to use his private bathroom, everybody uses it, and then I get a memo - a memo - telling me to use the men's room in the hall. Well, (laughing) I mean we share it with Pace Electronics. It's disgusting!
Listen, you're lucking I'm not asking for a whole refund. (trying to speak quietly) You gave me ladies' frames!
I just got here. My car broke down on the Belt Parkway.
Just need to uh, to dig 'em up.
I am never saying 'I love you' again unless they say it first.
Aw c'mon. It's a fantastic name. It's a real original, nobody else is gonna have it and I absolutely love it.
So what? Ill start talking to him, you know, casual, and Ill work my way around to it.
Why is nice bad? What kind a of sick society we are living in, when nice is bad?
Oh, no, that's just the old, uh, the old handicap acting up.
Did you see that? That-that pigeon didn't move! I had to swerve to get out of the way! I saved that pigeons life!
(depressed) Feel like I can't do anything wrong.
YES! It Blows Up! If you knew that, what did you tell Elaine for?
Could there be a native p0roblem in the Caymans? Maybe theres native unrest.
You, uh, you like baseball? [picks up baseball from desk]
How can I do this? How can I move back in with those people? Please, tell me. They're insane. You know that.
Oh, don't look. T-This is the part where they change me.
Wa, uh, thank you sir, you know I am not quite sure I'm right for it.
He's on the lamb(?), he's on the loose!
I told her what a sexist he is. How he cheats on his wife.
We were expecting about two hundred people...Well...Thank you , thank you.
Oh, well, so what? Laughter - what is that? I mean, what is the point of opening your mouth and going "Ha, ha!"? What is that? "Ha, ha!"?
We just go up to him, we say, "We're O'Brien."
(inhales deeply) I tell you, Jerry, I'm feeling something. Something I haven't felt in a long time.
How can you call yourself a clown and not know who Bozo is?
Because of the day before. It's a long story.
This is very hard to follow with all the talking.
Hey, check this out. I gotta give out Christmas presents to everyone down at Kruger, so I'm pulling a Whatley. (Give a Christmas card to Jerry)
(standing) Oh yeah, Reilly? (smugly) Well, the jerk store called. They're running outta you
Yes, yes! The punishment should fit the crime.
We had an incredible phone conversation. We talked for like twenty minutes. I threw away my notes in the middle of the call. You know, I thought she had a great voice timbre. Is it timbre or tamber?
He frolfs, he scores...(he drops one invitation on the stairs.)
No, Can't be...For instance I remember when we first met, we had a great conversation.
Listen. I want you guys to send along those agreements the minute you land. Our boys can't wait to kick your butts!
Ahh, Steinbrenner gave 'em to us, in honour of Phil Rizzuto being inducted into the Hall of Fame.
Yes, a shame. That is exactly how I would put it. Now Mrs. Sweedler, with all due discretion and sensitivity, and taking in the whole scope of the situation, I just can't help but think that, the hospital is somehow responsible for compensating the other, still living 'victim' of horrendous, horrendous tragedy.
No, not nice. She's stickin' it to me.
What are we supposed to do? What do you do on a situation like this? Should we call a lawyer, should we call the police?
She says she has to come to New York on business...
(animated) It failed here! Because, here, every time you turn on a TV, all you see is four morons sitting round an apartment, whining about their dates!
Yeah, I'm a great quitter. It's one of the few things I do well. I come form a long line of quitters. My father was a quitter, my grandfather was a quitter... I was raised to give up.
Ohh, hey there, young fella. (They shake hands) What's your major?
You know she was behind the idea. She was going to champion the show. That's what I was bring her up there to tell you. And she liked me.
In this scene my co-star who's right over here ( goes over to George who is still on the phone) Follow meeeee... is George Costanza, he plays an airline pilot who's just returned from Rome and I'm about to show him how much I've missed him.
Right, can we go? Cause Im double-parked, Im gonna get a ticket.
All right, let's postpone it. Let's get out of here.
And isn't it more fun using the urinal?
Of course. But I really wanna leave my mark this time, you know, uh. I wanna walk away from the Yankees with people saying 'Wow! Now that guy got canned!'
Oh, no, thanks. I cant drink coffee late at night, it keeps me up.
I eh, I had a sandwich in my pocket.
(Gloating) Hey, you got any extra furniture down there? I need some more stuff to fill that extra bedroom with the walk-in closet. (Smiles)
I have never seen a Mohel like that.
(Studying the salt shaker) I'm not taking a civil service test.
I don't wanna tell you how to run your show.
I'm sorry - I have to say, I'm a little disappointed, I thought it would be a lot nicer.
You know, you go out, you get another rye. Of course, it would have to be the same one from Schnitzer's. You put it in the kitchen somewhere and you say Ohh! There it is.
Do you? That makes me so happy. Elaine's proud of me Jerry.
One of your guys - Kip, or Ned, short name - stole my Twix candy bar!
Bear with you! This is a parking lot PEOPLE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO GET
(Stern, angered) I hope so. (Takes the scissors)
I was personable. Don't you think I was personable?
Hey Kramer, c'mon-- it was 240 bucks twenty years ago...
The whole time that I was growing up, all I ever heard from my mother was 'Why can't you be more like that Lloyd Braun?'
[realizing the only way out is to show the stub] I've got the stub.
I had a little tiff with Bonnie about the roommate.
I dunno, Jerry somethin's missing. There's a void, Jerry, there's a void...
But your life is Peterman's. Now the bus tour, which is real, takes to places that, while they are real, they are not real in sense that they did not *really* happen to the *real* Peterman which is you.
Ha Haaaaaaa... Jerry how do you like that.You see I get myself in a dizzy, I'm all worked up and for what?
I don't know why I bother even talking to you.
They want you to do a TV show?
No, I know I don't have to, I want to.
How much are we gonna get for this? Fifty, sixty thousand?
Uh, twice what youre payin here, but its a great building. Its two bedrooms!
I...I...write a letter and then I..I go to China. I disappear in a sea of people for like six months, a year you know just while things simmer down. Ehm.. Ehm...Dear Susan. I'm sorry. I made a terrible mistake. I'm really , really sorry.
I don't. Susan wants to have it out when Sally comes tomorrow.
Well, I'll tell you, Stacey. It's a lot of hard work. But, it comes fairly easy to me. Some people write symphonies. This is my gift. (Raises ski lift ticket while Stacey looks away)
All right Bubble Boy. Let's just play... Who invaded Spain in the 8th century?
What, is that the one your parents gave you?
(Holding his drink up to his mouth) Oh my gosh, I just had a great idea. She could come to the party tomorrow and read Gwen's lips for me.
I got engaged. I'm getting married. I asked Susan to marry me. We're getting married this Christmas.
I know that's why I bought `em but they're not comfortable.
Thats my candy line-up! Where are all my cards?! Theyre - theyre all on the floor!
Why?! Because you were stabbed, and.. got coffee thrown in your face, and.. uh.. (Points to Alan's bandaged forehead)
It's worth a shot. (Goes to the door.)
'Just listen to the music of the traffic, in the city. Linger on the sidewalk, where the neon lights are pretty.' Where the neon lights are pretty. The Broadway area?
(shouting) What happened to Soda?! I thought we all agreed on Soda.
All right. That's more like it. Thank you very much. (giving the sponsor the 'be strong' hand clench) By the way, my uncle was an alcoholic, so...
Well bear in mind that I am in the smaller office.
Yeah. I don't think they'll be able to tell.
Really? (Jerry nods his head) Well, what if it doesnt stop? Oh, that I really needed to hear. That helps a lot! All right, just say something. Just start talking. Change the subject. Lets just go, All right? I cant believe were having dinner with Alton Benes.
Mr. Thomassoulo during times of great stress, people are capable of super human strength. Have you ever seen the Incredible Hulk, sir?
(CONT'D) Excuse me...I really... What's happened is that my friend forgot where he parked and if you're not in a big hurry, we'd really appreciate it if...
I know. The only way to fix it now, is to get a whole new photo of Kruger.
Name tags! Name tags! What kind of an idiot thinks anybody would be interested in an idea like that.
He's a sports writer for the daily news. I find him very insightful...
(Impersonating Carson) I didn't not know that. Weird. Wild. (Susan and George both laugh)
Why couldn't you squeeze one of those stupid rubber balls to get your stress out? Why did you have to destroy *twenty-five* computers?
(upset) Well, you've scared her off. We may never see mom again.
(Somewhat stern) Oh, the thing's cancelled. Sit down.
(standing up) I'm just gonna go to the bathroom.
Um, you know Im starting to think that maybe lobster isnt the way to go.
Fine. Steal the battery. Now, all right, here is the Frogger. This is the front door, and this is the outlet.
Well this is bad. I am really in a bad situation now.
OH!!!! What are you, crazy?! Are you, crazy?!
I don't know, but those are my socks! I had a pair just like that with the blue stripe, and now I don't have them anymore!
(yelling) Awright, let's just stay calm here! Don't get all crazy on me!
(Smiling) You got it, Ma. (She smiles back, nodding) A little later. (George sits back in a nearby chair, looking at the divider in anticipation)
I don't understand. They're supposed to be casting this week. Something's wrong. Maybe they're not doing it.
Oh, look, he's going to ask you about my arm. So, just tell him I banged it against a desk. And it's been moving involuntarily ever since.
Going backstage is the worst. Especially when they stink. You know that's a real problem.
I don't even think she'd notice it. Can you see it?
All right. Shh! I gotta focus. I'm shifting into soup mode.
He purposely mispronounced my name. Instead of saying, "Costanza" He'd say, "Can't stand ja". "Can't stand ja" ... He made me smell my own gym socks once.
...so mind you, at this point I'm only going out with her two or three weeks. So she goes out of town and she asks me to feed her cat. So at this time, there's a lot of stuff going on in my life and, uh, it slips my mind for a few days. Maybe a week. Not a week, five, six days.
I'm going straight to hell, no two ways about it.
Yeah I guess. What can I do? I gotta take her with me. Todd introduced us, I'm obligated.
It is a horrible company. There's no management what so ever. I could go hog wild in there.
What about the body, what kind of body?
Yeah. You could base a character on me.
(turning to each other) I dont know. Hes an importer.
I told her we'd all go out afterwards, okay? And don't applaud when she stops playing the first time. It's not over yet.
So I still haven't heard about that job.
Really? (Jerry shakes his head) Maybe this will become like a cool thing, living with your parents.
But you didn't use a coaster, Jerry, you left a stain! (he runs to kitchen)
So what do you want me to do?
You know, I cant believe youre bringin in an extra bed for woman that wants to sleep with you. Why dont you bring in an extra guy too?
Yes. Me, too. I wanna be normal. Normal.
Let's say it comes down to me and one other guy. He's got a nice quiet suit, and I'm whooshing all over the place! Who do you think he's gonna hire?
Is there any work being done? Is there any rubbing, touching, finger manipulation on the other person, and if so, who's making the request?
You can't just walk into a building and say " I wanna be a talk show host."
We, uh, we go on foot from here.
Alright, well why don't we smooth the head down to nothing, stick a pumpkin under its arm and change the nameplate to Ichabod Crane?
Why'd I think it was timbre? Yeah, she could do voiceover commercials, why didn't you tell me about her voice?
Do you know how much this is going to cost me?
Oh geeeee. (George pantomimes sticking a knife in his heart, and twists it.) Go, go!
"There may be a problem with the phone, hold on"!
Oh, that's a dangerous fruit. It's like a weapon that thing, got spikes on the end. You can get killed from one of those things.
(To the man behind him in line) Yeah, right Im gonna get my car repaired at a dealership. Huh! Why dont I just flush my money down the toilet?
Please. They dont do anything. Look, do I have to break up with her in person? Cant I do it over the phone? I-I have no stomach for these things.
Sorry, you don't know what's going on out there! (looks at Owen) Who's he?
Yeah, woman have no problem getting the hand off. How do they do that?
I was, I had to leave. She lit some vanilla incenses. The smell drove me nuts, all I could think about was food, I had to get out of there. We need some pudding here! Pudding!
Dad, it's me. Hey, listen, I was at Fortunoff's the other day, and, you know what, you were right.
Tsst...'Course I have. Come on. My cousin's in a bubble. My friend Jeffrey's uh, sister, also ... bubble ... you know. I got a lot of bubble experience. Come on.
Don't go shouting we got a hundred dollar bill. People will be jumping out of windows on top of us.
Yeah, and I - I heard you got on their good side. Now, what'd you do?
I, uh, should have a poem very soon now.
So, Elaine, are you going to sleep with me or what?!
And I am not a piece of toast.
Well, I started to tell her and then all of the sudden, for some reason, I just burst into tears.
I-I'm sure if you weren't satisfied you would probably say something wouldn't you?
No I, I want it if you dont want it.
I did. I'm back. I love this relationship, I feel so liberated!
I'm not crying. And I shouldn't have said that about your wife. Please accept my apologies.
Excuse me sir. Would you mind watching my bag for a minute?
You know that coat was Gore-Tex. Its worth a hell of a lot more than that, cheap Chardonnay.
Right.. the sign. (Hesitates, then makes a series of stupid gestures)
(cocky laughter) Huh haha! (shouts) You're meat, Reilly! You just screwed yourself! (laughter) Ha ha!
(gleeful) Hehee. W..we could be like the Gatsbys. Didn't they always like, you know, a bunch of people around, and they were all best friends?
Hey. You know, do I have a case for you guys to do on L.A. Law.
Because before you know it he'll be having lunch with him. You know how these interoffice politics work.
I got a feeling I'm gonna be much smarter than you pretty soon.
You can stuff you sorries in a sack, mister!
The Rogue's Wallet. That's where he kept his card, his dirty little secret. Short, devious, balding. his name was Costanza. He killed my mother.
Hey, last night, I found a whole Weeble Village right behind the EZ Bake oven.
I don't want to! I'm outta money! I got 714 dollars left in the bank.
Why did the policeman have to yell at me like that? (Elaine enters)
No no no, you know actually we are friends of a serial killer.
Yeah. Steinbrenner wants everyone in the front office to give a lecture in their area of business expertise.
Oh I'm seeing someone, yes. You know her, Daphne Bower.
Yeah, I grabbed it on the way out, I don't want my mother reading it.
I can't believe it. Look, that's Jerry Seinfeld.
(feigning excitement) Great, great. O-Oh, oh, oh, gosh. You know, it's just... my duties with the Yankees...
So I'm sure whatever germs it landed on were knocked out, and by the time the rest of them realised what was going on, you had already grabbed it out.
All right, all right. Thats it. Im gonna go down there.
Elaine, I got to have another picture of Gillian.
Uh, we're cool. Everything's cool (to security attendent)
Oh, I can't believe you're dropping out, too. So now Kramer and I have to pay for the entire gift?
It's like a magic trick. Sometimes I think it would be easier to bend a spoon mentally than to make that transformation.
Hate those couples. I could never bee one of those couples. There are no bald woman around. You know?
Ha! (grabs his coat and exits the apartment)
(Picking up the ketchup) What typical? Gimme typical. Gimme some typical.
Sir, I'm sure it's not a police matter.
I want to know how did that get into my car?
Well I was just going to wander the streets. Don't wanna tag along with you or anything.
Well, what is that? That's a crime! Do you know how hot those things get? They should be wearing cotton.
No one's putting a gun to your head. Do I, uh, scare you?
No. But I was the only one at the table that didn't get violently ill.
The door? Why would I go out the door? The window's right here.
Huh-Hi. (looks around a little) Uhm, is Neil here?
May I just use your bathroom for a moment?
Right. So I call her up, I tell her its me, she gives me an enthusiastic Hi!
Yeah. (another pause) Not that I care, one way or the other, but these doctors today really do amazing things, you know, if you were so inclined. And again, I'm not suggesting.
(to the executives) Excuse me. Did you hire the Sunshine Carpet Cleaners?
That's no tragedy! How many people do you lose on a normal cruse? 30? 40?! Kramer, can I take a look at that book? (Starts walking tward the door. Kramer grabs his food, and follows)
Maybe I'll go down to the track. Put it all on a horse...
Wait wait wait, what is she... (takes the milk can from Jerry and puts it on the table) What is she like?
It it's huge. It's probably like North Dakota.
Hey, Mr Seinfeld. (shakes Morty's hand) Hey, Mrs Seinfeld. How are you?
Yes, well, if the other people in the office saw that I called an exterminator, they would just panic. Besides, this is sort of a friendly visit. Carl, right?
Why not? It's a good look for a woman.
He didnt do anything, Jerry. Its a scam! Who told you to do that?
No, its not a problem, I can get rid of the apartment this afternoon.
All day. ( phone rings , Jerry picks up)
Jerry, come on. If my mother keeps shrinking, this is exactly what she's gonna look like in ten years!
Uh, let me ask you a question. Could you, uh, expand the space underneath a desk to give it a little more headroom?
Don't worry, we'll find something for you. (Knock of Jerry's door)
You know. You use the, uh...(mutters something unintelligible under his breath.)
You know Elaine, I'd do it but I'm working that day.
Oh my God. I must be crazy. What have I done?
(excited) So then, as we were leaving, we were just kind of standing there, and she was sort of smiling at me, and I wasnt sure if she wanted me to ask her out, because when women smile at me I dont know what it means. Sometimes I interpret it like theyre psychotic or something and I dont know if Im supposed to smile back, I dont know what to do. So I just stood there like  remember how Quayle looked when Benson gave him that Kennedy line? Thats what I looked like.
The doctors thought he had cancer, but the surgery revealed he never actually had it.
They're worse! They're much worse than us, they talk about everything! Couldn't you at least tell her about the shrinkage factor?
Me either. Is there anything you can do to shut them up?
I don't know what Newman wanted to see me for.
And I didnt even ask her out. She asked me out first. She called me up. What was I supposed to do? Say no? (laughs) I cant do that to someone.
I don't know why Rachel had to drive back with Michael and Carol.
Thats all there is to it. By Christmas day I will be Brother Costanza.
I feel like I got a B12 shot. This is like a taste explosion!
You see, my friend here, his aunt passed away last night.
I just wanted to talk to Tony for a minute (hands Elaine some stuff)
Whoa, look at this. This is a beautiful suit. Huh?
No, I don't have any change. I never carry change.
Hey, what about this? I'm in a car accident. The motorist is uninsured, you with me?
I just don't think it's such a great idea for you to sit here.
Because great couples always have a great story about how they met. That's why I've never been in a long term relationship. I've never had a good meeting story.
You're cutting me off? No, no, no Jerry, don't cut me off!
Have to give him time on this hour.
I'm family. I'm having sex with the cousin!
Oh, please ... ... four dollars is f...
I'll call a plumber right now! (Goes for the phone.)
Oh, see? that's why I don't have cable in my house. Because of that naked station. If I had that in my house, I would never turn it off. I wouldn't sleep, I wouldn't eat. Eventually, firemen would have to break through the door, they'd find me sitting there in my pajamas with drool coming down my face. All right, all right. So you're watching the naked station.
You met her a few weeks ago, but...?
Yeah. (clears his throat) We should do this again.
You don't work in the rain? Your a mailman."Neither rain nor sleet nor snow....."It's the first one.
I know what you're going through. Women. Who knows what they want?
(he thinks) I think the hats. The hat conveys that solemn religious look you want in a faith. Very pious.
Are you going to help me or not?
but..why, it wasn't my fault, I .. you asked me a sandwich, I .. I make such delicious sandwiches Elaine
Oh, you spoiled, spoiled man. Do you now how much mental energy I expend just trying to picture women naked?
(interrupting) You know we should really order, the service is so slow here, by the time you get anything...
You mean just walk into the staff meeting on Monday morning like it never happened?
Oh I was not. The BUBBLE BOY was tried to kill me.
Well, not recently. I craved. I crave all the time, constant craving...but I haven't yearned.
If you're in some situation where some fast cash will save your life, I'll give you the code.
That's exactly what I said, except I used the word "momentum".
(opening door) It's a big night. I'm, uh, ice skating with one, and going to a staged reading of "Godspell" with the other.
Well I I ..put a lot of thought into this and I think I would like you to sign a prenuptual agreement.
No. And he's not a pig-man is he?
I'm sorry I'm sorry, here's the test. Thanks again for doing this - hhe.
He said he didn't care. Oh, God I love that place. Hey, have you seen other dermatologist?
She happens to be very good friends with her.
What if she becomes Miss America? You could be dating Miss America, Jerry!
All right, shes not even gonna ask, if we see her, which is remote.
I'm engaged to Mr. Ross' niece. I'm probably gonna be taking over this whole place someday so if I were you I would stay on my good side.
tsh (snorts) Ah, yeah, we've - we've talked . . . I believe I can speak for the both of us on this.
All right, no more lies. Elaine is been chosen to represent the Upper West Side in the next Biosphere project.
This is a huge project involving lots of numbers and papers and folders.
No. Semi-daily. Four or five times a week.
Why even try anymore? There's no sense to it. I'm never gonna meet anybody, I should just accept it.
(animated) N..no, no. You can't leave me. (frantic) Marry me! I'll burn myself. I'll burn my parents!
Does that mean I have to go too?
(standing) All right, I'm gonna move my car, my meter's up. Can't park in this city.
Yeah, I would. It's just, you know, I just ate a whole pot roast.
The second time I sent the noodles back, I tought she made a face...
You are gonna love this car. Even if you don't like Jon Voight.
What idea? I just said something. I didn't know you were going to listen to me.
Ah, great. All right, with the wine I'm in over twenty dollars now.
No, no. I just got here. A few minutes ago.
What is that, immigrants come over, you show them how to act natural?
Besides, what's it gonna cost me? Thirty-eight bucks?
How could you not know who Bozo the Clown is?
Pick up the phone, Elaine. Pick it up!
Hi, how are you guys? Listen, does either one of you have like a mint or piece of gum or...
Oh, Noooo, I'm so sorry. It's the MOOPS. The correct answer is, The MOOPS.
Oh... do I have to write him a note or something?
S-s-somebody double parked, we couldn't help it. It might have been Saddam Hussein, we're not really sure. He eh, had a British accent though.
No, I brought a picture of the chair.
They're not mocked and humiliated when they get to the other side.
Ill tell you when it happened. When that floss came flying out of my pocket.
There must be some way to find out.
Every summer you guys went to camp together. I was jealous. Felt like he was the summer me.
She told this couple she had an affair with a matador.
I suppose he could swivel. Hey maybe one of those director's chairs. What do you think of those.
George! She said George? She remembered my name. (loudly -- to a passing waitress and the rest of the restaurant) Diane DeConn remembered my name. She was the "it" girl!
Now, fellas, fellas.. easy. You wouldn't want to beat up on one of your own.
I don't even drink wine. I drink Pepsi.
There was an incident. I'd rather not discuss it.
Um, excuse me, I think you forgot my bread.
Well, I could be a little sweetie tweetie weetie weetie.
You remember the woman on the horse? She wanted my spot.
Why do you have to be so suspicious of every one. This is a great man Zeng Zau, he wants to help bald people.
Morgan? No. He's doing a great job. (winks)
(in the threshold between the living room and the kitchen) The thing that bothers me the most, is the lying.
Oh, I understand. (George exits; Sees Kramer in the hallway) Hey.
Woo! Courtside! (mock-snide) Is that the best you could do? Ha ha!
(leaving) Alright that's it for me. Good night everybody.
All right, shmoopies...what's it gonna be? Pick a theater.
(trying to laugh it off) Right. C'mon! I'm having an affair with Elaine?! If I was having an affair with Elaine, I wouldn't tell you I'm going to see Elaine. I would make up some other person to tell you I was gonna go see, and then I would go see Ela..Elaine.
How so? I'll tell you how so. She's bald!
(George puts on the headphones) Oh! my god...
(Gets up, stopping him) Woah, woah, woah! What are you telling me for? You really had me going, there! C'mon, sit down. (They both sit back down) What do you want to do when you grow up?
Look I need you to do me a favor. I need you to get me lunch at Pisano's.
(Standing up, still waking up) Alright, you know what we should do? We should go to the movies. Get away from this script for a while..
Alright, I'll tell you what you do. You call her back and give her the "it's me", heh? Pull the old switcheroo.
Those were her exact words, I like George.
Sorry. I'll just go back to my usual routine.
Cancer? Is it cancer? Do I have cancer?
Yeah, much better. All right, so what's the move, because I need *something*. This woman I'm dating, it's like she's doing her nails during love-making.
Oh I'm going baby! I'm going! (he leaves)
Oh, well I didn't know you went into Queens Jerry.
It wasn't down in, it was sort of on top.
Ha! (snort) Can you believe it? (amused) I'm supposed to be havin' lunch with her right now at Pomodoro.
Elaine, shes a psychic. She knows how the kids going to be.
(Laughs slightly) A physician married to a salesman. (Chuckles) Well, I gotta tell you, Beth, you coulda done a lot better than him.
Ade, I have to tell you, I, I have never met anybody so ... efficient.
I got some cufflinks I could've loaned you.
Well, you know, I shouldn't have let you into Kramer's, now you want to go into Elaine's...she entrusted me with her spare keys, how can I just let you in?
. . . naw, it's just you thanked HER, and and oh, . . . what's the difference?
Forget about smelling the car. Smell the valet. Go to the source...
Eh, there's that woman that never talks to anybody.
[whispering] Elaine? [loud whisper] Elaine! [louder whisper] Elaine!
Great, great. So anytime you want you can just visualize her naked.
Yeah, the tenant association has decided to hear my side of the story. So, uh, I gotta kinda get ready. I'll see ya.
Why don't you call her agency. Maybe she's been out of town and she didn't get the calls.
Oh, man, it's spinach! I've been walking around like this all afternoon.
And it's their anniversary Friday night. I could send them for a hansom cab ride. Y -- you think they'd like that?
Listen. You're beautiful. You're intelligent. You'll meet other girls...
(trying again with Glenda) I'm gonna count to three. If you don't give up the chair, the wig is coming off.
Ok. Good. And Kramer, you're in charge of taping off the loading zone.
Oh, you're fine... you're fine. (looking at Tom in the back and then quieter to Jerry) So you think this guy playing Kramer took the raisins?
Wha! You know, it's a pain to change that. You gotta lift up that plastic thing with a pen.
(Standing up) I just got here, Ma! I'd like to spend a little time with you.
Oh you mean face down on her chest.
No, not a racial thing, there really is a resemblance...
No one gives us the finger! We're Yankees!
No, you go Guggenheim. I'm not much of a Guggenheim.
(wiping the area with a hand) People think they're so important...
Oh, you know what you're like? You're like a pathetic gambler. You're one of those losers in Las Vegas who keeps thinking he's gonna come up with a way to win at blackjack.
You should have somebody take a look at that.
I know it's a doll, but it looks like my mother!
My name is not mentioned in this blurb...
You know, a muffin can be very filling.
My name is George. I'm unemployed and I live with my parents.
So you're gonna let me get suspended for shower urination?
Guys, hitting is not about muscle. It's simple physics. Calculate the velocity, v, in relation to the trajectory, t, in which g, gravity, of course remains a constant. (Hits a home run) It's not complicated.
So we order lunch, and were talking. Finally, she blurts out how its not working.
So what! Have a yoke! It won't kill you.
I want you to have this job. Of course...
Do me a favor would you? Would you change lanes? Would you get outta this lane. You gotta get out of this lane. This lane stinks. They're all double parked here Please get outta this lane. I'm beggin you please please.
Ya know, I was just a little surprised.
So, I've got ice cream all over my face. There were no napkins there. Whoever it was that's responsible for stocking that concession stand cost me a relationship.
This must be Sheila from the photo place.
Really? I thought you and Celia were sleeping together?
Of course, I'm the result of my parents having stayed together, so you never know. (Russell comes out of the bathroom.)
It's impossible. I got him a wake up service.
(Scoffs) ARe you kidding? Lincoln Center. Alice Tully Hall, the Met. Magnificent facilities.
Oh, its a great place, its uh two-bedroom uh, west 83rd bout half block from the park.
So let's say in her mind she witnessed a pick. Okay, so then what?
Yeah, I know that. (clears throat) Could you start, working?
Alright, this is what ya gotta do I need ya to go out to the parking lot at Yankee Stadium, take the flyers off my car.
Who would Want to. She tried to end it with me, Jerry.
Well, you see, what happened was...the doctor - the very same doctor that was attending to my late aunt - suffered an untimely stroke, and lost the use of his right hand, so...obviously I was unable to get the death certificate. However, I do have this. (Reaches inside his coat and takes out a Polaroid photo.)
(resolved) Why not. (determined) If she can't find me, she can't break up with me. And, if we're still goin' out, she has to gooo to the ballll.
(to the woman) Boy, I have to get to a bathroom.
Hold on. Hold on. Wait a minute. How am I gonna get the rye bread into the apartment?
Yeah. Eric the Clown put it out with his big shoe.
When you sent me the-the bill for the dry-cleaning. I thought the show didn't have a chance.
Say you go to the bathroom at two o'clock in the morning, what's the outfit? I mean, you dressing up or is it come as you are?
This good be so sweet, Jerry. Saving lives? She's one step away working at the clinique counter!
(Still on the showers) Can I use hot water on my face?
What could I do?! We fooled around and went to a movie!
There has got to be some way to get back into Pisano's.
If you go now, I know what's gonna happen. We'll find the car, Jerry will show up, and then we'll never find you.
It's that bleak? (pours a glass of milk)
That's right, you heard me. Get out! You are ruining this whole experience for me!
Knock it off, just sit in your seat over there you're distracting me. We're making incredible time here. I once went into Kennedy Airport from West 81st Street to in uh, in 15 minutes. hu uh. Oh, here hold this. It's uh, ten dollars for the tolls.
How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria?
No No I'm working on a system...Who was that?
She's working late that night. We're - were supposed to have dinner with everybody at eight o'clock so I'll set up the ride for seven o'clock.
She treated me to the Arabian mocha java.
Well, I still don't know what I'm supposed to do. I don't even know what my assignment is.
Oh no no no no, don't say anything to Kramer. Susan can't stand him. He vomited all over her.
(To Susan) I told you it looked like her..
Hey. Hey. Answer me! Come on, show yourselves!
(quietly) That's uh, for the two of us.
What's the difference? The money is not important.
Hey, they can't go, "Hey! You look fabulous!"
I got it. Cups in the front, loops in the back. (puts the bra on the table)
Well, not really. After all, she did get together with George Peppard. I mean, Fred.
There she is. (waiving his arms quickly above the table - to nix the conversation) No no no no no no.
(opening door to leave) He picked her up?
No, no, no, no, Im It. I win.
(through a mouthful) Long as they don't throw 'em on the field. (laughs) Huhu. (indicating dish) Help yourself to some shrimp, I brought enough for everybody.
(nervous) All right now we're going bye bye.
Oh, its from Les Miserables. I went to see it last week. I cant get it out of my head. I just keep singing it over and over. It just comes out. I have no control over it. Im singin it on elevators, buses. Im singin it in front of clients. Its taken over my life.
You're not letting him win. He wins till you're forty.
All my life I've dreamed of sitting front row, behind the dugout!
Between the car getting totalled, the towing charge and the fine, there's no way I can ever pay him back...
It's a foreign movie... a *film*, is what it is, actually.
(Hands Antonio a card) Here's my card. I'm in real estate, so, if you're ever looking for something bigger, something nicer.. (Antonio is staring at him, angered) ..maybe not right now. Anyway.. (Extends his hand for a handshake. Antonio doesn't move)
I, I think I made my point. I'm sorry if I was a little harsh.
So what have you been doing with yourself?
Oh, I was trying to make a point.
Woo! Some day out there - You ever see weather like that? Woo! It's crisp - it's crispy crisp.
Ben Cantwell. 85. Huh... You think we'll make it to that age?
Oh, oh. Uh, you know. It's the damndest thing. I, uh, I moved recently and my files, pfff, disappeared. Now, I-I don't know if they fell off the truck or if there was some sort of foul play but let me tell you something. I'm not through with that moving company.
I bent over backwards for that woman! Is it that thing I said about her sister?
Yeah, like I'm going to risk my job with the New York Yankees to make a few extra bucks. (winks)
What about these two? Aren't they gonna chip in?
Hey pop, would you buzz off, I've got something cooking.
"Hey listen, let me give you my card. It's got my home number on it. I want to buy the first pair when the next shipment comes in."
(excited) Ho ho! (gestures and steps towards bedroom but Loretta walks the other way to the couch)
(humble) Well, if you must know, shhhe, was my fiance, Susan. May she rest in peace.
Because you're a gymnastics teacher. It's only natural.
Loves bald? (laughs) Wow. Who uh, who is she?
(Depressed) Well,.. the Andrea Doria.. that was quite a fire. (Moves to the door, leaving)
Jerry, would you do me a favor, close the window.
Nah. It's all right. Great! She had a good time.
What's the matter with you? Are you crazy? Why are you using my name?!
This is very exciting! You're on the Tonight Show, NBC, who else is on the show?
I wanna get it back when we were the Gatsbys.
Well, it's not my fault. You poked me!
Ive spent the last hour preparing ten candy bars with no wrappers or identification of any kind for him to select from.
So you're buying the car back for your parents?
Ah, alright. Believe me, that kid's gonna be called Soda.
'The lights are much brighter there. You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares, just go...'
Helping people... Of course. Of course! It makes perfect sense! How could I *not* be doing this!? I am gonna help somebody, Dammit!
Excuse me, uh I couldn't help but notice that you were looking in my direction.
How are we gonna get out of here? We need a plan!
Aaaa (looking around for Jerry) aaaa (finds Jerry) Ah ha. They had plans huh? They were busy. They were busy with their (doing a little dance to make the plans seem all that important) big plans!
Well at least you accomplished something. You got fish.
[to himself] Argh! [to Susan] Susan! Hi! Oh, boy! What are you doing here?!
Lesbian wedding. How do they work bride and groom out, what do they flip a coin?
Yeah, yeah, the flower guy. Listen, I know this all sounds a little crazy, but...
(Puts his hands on his face, rubbing his eyes) Look. It's a skill, just like juggling. She probably enjoys showing it off.
You're a very handsome man, by the way.
Yes, you know. Deal with it .We have to deal with the doubt, Susan The DOUBT!! Must be dealt with.
Umm, Im not. Its just a sociological experiment!
Jerry, unless I pull down on this statuette and a hidden wall opens up, we have checked every square inch of this apartment!
(Struggling) No, no, no, no. I can walk it off. It's a hundred and twenty degrees in here.. I'll sweat it out.
Well, sorry I missed that, uh, charity thing. But this was one of those truly glorious Hampton weekends that you always hear about.
Sure. You know, Rhisa. I've always found you... very attractive.
If youre a spirit, and you can travel to other dimensions and galaxies, and find out the mysteries of the universe, you think shes gonna wanna hang around Drexlers funeral home on Ocean Parkway?
(glances upwards) Yeah. Uhm, why did she die so young?
Im okay. Im fine. Im wonderful. I never felt better in my whole life.
Hey look a that - boy are you lucky - another great spot - right in front of the hospital. In an emergency yet! How lucky are you huh? Is that unbelievable? How unbelievable is that huh? Come on, give it to me, give it to me.
You don't understand. A garage. I can't even pull in there. It's like going to a prostitute. Why should I pay, when if I apply myself, maybe I could get it for free? (he hears a horn honking) What? What do you want? Go around me, I'm looking for spaces.
well I don't know if there's gonna be any place to eat up there
Look, I'm doing you a favor. They're having an unadvertised sale. This suit is gonna be half-priced starting ... Monday.
(surprise) Huh. I never heard you say you admire me for anything.
(MUMBLING) You come to a parking lot, you write it down. How hard is that?
I, I couldnt wait. I was too anxious to see you.
Yeah, as a matter of fact, I did.
I believe you cut me off, and then made an obscene gesture.
She um, she wants to see The Muted Heart.
Ah, Alright, before that, I was in real estate. I quit, because the boss wouldn't let me use his private bathroom. That was it.
She asked about me? What did- What did she say?
Maybe she just wants to talk to me?
Well, I wish I could say the same, but I must say, with all due respect, I find it very hard to see the logic behind some of the moves you have made with this fine organization. In the past twenty years you have caused myself, and the city of New York, a good deal of distress, as we have watched you take our beloved Yankees and reduced them to a laughing stock, all for the glorification of your massive ego!
What about the Coast Guard? Seems like a lot of pride there, a lot of tradition.
You only went in front first 'cause you saw me backing up and you didn't have room to parallel park!
There was something so reassuring about that cozy little space.
Please give it to me. I love to help people. This is what I do. Come on. I'm going this way. (he takes the table from Jodi's hands and she has no choice but to follow him)
Well, you should always consider podiatry. (Patting Ricky on the shoulder) There's nothing wrong with the feet. (Ricky looks critically back at George)
I know, swan dives from twenty floors up, lands right on top. What do I got a bulls eye up there? He couldn't move over two feet? Land on the sidewalk. It's city property.
Absolutely. Because instead of doing a wash, I just keep buying underwear. My goal is to have over three hundred and sixty pair. That way, I only have to do wash once a year.
I was in there for two minutes. He didnt do anything. Touch this, feel that  seventy-five bucks!
And you! How many Twix does that make for you, today?! Like, 8 Twix?!
Oh, it's a bad day. Uh, you got everyone in your house, you're thinkin', "These are my friends?!"
I need food, Jerry. I feel faint, I'm getting light headed.
Ladies and gentlemen, this (Opens the door, Steven is standing there) is Steven Koren. His G.P.A. is a solid 2.0! Right in that meaty part of the curve - not showing off, not falling behind.
It's like you're livin' in the Playboy Mansion! Did she, uh, did she frolic?
Carrie, could you do me a favour? Could you not mention this to your mother?
Well, I told it to Susan before, and she didn't like it.
I'm not her boyfriend. I want to be her boyfriend.
Well all right, beautiful, so you stop in. Ya, ya visit the bubble boy for twenty minutes and then we can go.
I walked in, your lobby door is broken again.
Every night at six-thirty. The nurse was gorgeous.. then I got a look at the patient.. (Laughs, then snorts) I was going nuts.
Why'd you pick Hoover? Was he that interesting to talk to?
You can see the Cayman Islands in there? Is something going to happen to me? What?
I don't know what you're getting all riled up about. There are probably a million Costanzas-
Oh, no no no. I was just looking for stock-pages. Here it is. Looking for the quotes. Gotta check to quotes. Love a good quote. Oh, IBM up a quarter.
What, did you go swimmin'? It's 29 degrees out!
I have to talk to you about something .
O.k....(thinks) I think I know where we can get one.
Hey, a "hit" is a totally different story.
No, no. I reached down and there was *nothing* there.
Of course you do, but youre imagining a guy you like, not a guy who goes, Oh no, I dont drink coffee late at night. If I call her now, shes gonna think Im too needy. Women dont wanna see need. They want a take-charge guy  a colonel, a Kaiser, a tsar.
I wonder if, ah, Susan ... (picks up the phone from the coffee table, then decides not to call) No. I better just go. (claps hands) heh. All right! See ya. (grabs his rain coat from the hook by the door and rushes out)
(still on the phone) All right fine.... Whatever
Well, of course they're trying to screw you. What do you think? That's what they do. They can make up anything. Nobody knows. "By the way, you need a new Johnson rod in there." "Oh, a Johnson rod. Yeah, well, you better put one of those on."
Hey, let's turn off the lights, get some real 'movie atmosphere.'
Sure. I could go the tomato route. But eh, I've given this a lot of thought Jerry. All that frustration. Ill never get any work done. So Im doing a complete 360. Im going for total efficiency and ability.
Well get it back! It's very important. (winks)
Can't you think of something. Call in a bomb threat.
(getting up and leaving) Alright! That's it for me. Goodnight everybody.
Alright, I'll tell you the truth. I'm not gay. My name's Buck Naked, I'm a porno actor.
(To himself) So you're havin' the sex, next day you don't have to call. That's pretty good. (Back to Jerry) Go ahead.
Well, it's the damnedest thing. The cat dies. So she comes back into town, she finds the cat lying on the carpet stiff as a board.
You heard the man. I guess you gotta be moving your car.
This is by far the most exciting thing I've ever done.
Because you called her by the wrong name.
I don't even like to sit next to a man on an airplane 'cause our knees might touch.
It's cleavage. I couldn't look away. What am I, waiting to win an Oscar here? This is all I have in my life.
Alright, now you're gonna see some parallel parking. (spitting into his hands and rubbing them together) How I wish you could make a living parallel parking. (turning around in his seat) It's all geometry, knowing all the angles, when to make that first turn and then when to swing it back in, that's the key.
(Persistent) Perhaps you could look again, please? Im very hungry.
Nothing, I... said it was a little problem.
No, no that can happen. Ive, uh, Ive read about that in medical journals. Its a freak thing, but...
Yeah, yeah. You really cashed in on that favor pretty quick.
I gotta go help her tape up all his boxes and get them ready for shipping.
All right, all right, calm down, calm down. Whatever happened in the past is past.
Why does she want you to be mad?
(really animated) Alright, alright. You see? This is why I hate writing with a large group. Everybody has their own little opinions, and it all gets homogenised, and you lose the whole edge of it. I'm going with jerk store! Jerk store is the line! Jerk store! Yess!
Yeah, the super glossy. The best they had.
Yeah, no pop-in, no "in the neighborhood," no "I saw your light was on." And the best part is, if things go really well...
Oh what's the difference? We'll all be dead eventually.
I can't believe you're hoarding sex moves. I'm out there rubbing two sticks together. You walk around with a zippo.
Alright. 7,7, (points at himself) 6. I'm not gonna eat that much!
Yeah? Well, I had sex with your wife.
Hey, did I tell you I called one of those girls from the personal ads in The Daily Worker?
Wow, he really does a number on you. (reads) "Seinfeld froze like a deer in the headlights in the face of incessant heckling."
25 kids for his birthday party? (to kid under table) Don't put your tongue on the floor! He's putting his tongue on the floor! Here, here, have some more sugar packets. (tosses some Equal packets under the table)
What do you mean - "Not letting you?"
And then assuming the strike is resolved, on April 14th, we, ah, play the Angels. So lets clear a floor at the Anaheim Hotel.
Why? Because we're a team! C'mon! Would you take this for us, dear? Thank you very much. Here we go... (To Morgan) Anyone ever tell you you look a lot like Sugar Ray Leonard? Yeah, you must get that all the time.
One of the guys in my cell threw a piece of gum at him.
Alright, I just have to go over to the Ross' apartment and drop off Susan's sunglasses. You'll come with me?
Yeah. I got 'em down to fifty bucks. I just have to do all the jackhammering myself.
Oh, well, he was probably just getting anxious to start his vacation.
Uh, heading out. Jerry really hates to miss the coming attractions.
Well, you're gonna have to go to the bathroom!
The show will be like a heart attack!
Okay. (Chewing) Thanks anyway. (Continues to chew as he exits)
It's my name. I made it up. You can't just steal it.
Well, it was very nice meeting you Shelly and Jerry be careful, there's a lot of nuts out there. (to Paula) All right you have everything?
No, no. It wasn't a shift, I've shifted, this was a move.
Exactly! Because neither one of us can't handle a woman all by ourselves.
It was a fat camp. Those kids depended on me.
Algae, obviously plankton, hmhm. I don't know what else I could tell ya, ah, Oh I-I just got back from a trip to the Galapagos Islands, I was living with the turtles.
Yeah, I should do the opposite, I should.
Youre not getting no Drakes Coffee Cake for fifty cents. Yae, Hey, Im all set. I got the ticket. Im going to the Cayman Islands this Friday.
An eye job? Ma, you don't need an eye job.
They'll make you a Big Salad. What do you think, they're the only one's that make a Big Salad?
Why did it all turn out like this for me? I had so much promise. I was personable, I was bright. (Elaine turns showing disagreement) Oh, maybe not academically speaking, (Elaine nods correct) I was perceptive. I always know when someone's uncomfortable at a party.
Well, it worked when I met George Peppard last week.
Well, cause we were just saying we were going to ask you to come up to the country with us this weekend. Susan's father has a cabin up there. But, eh, all right, well.
I'm against all "it's me"s. So self-absorbed and egotistical, it's like those hip musicians with their complicated shoes!
And here's a roll that I think you may enjoy.
Well, don't they make a counter offer? How can they just cancel the whole deal like that? What kind of a maniac is this guy? I mean he just, he says no, and that's it?
What's the difference, you're a woman. They're supposed to be touching you.
Yeah, let him chew on that for a while.
No, don't say a word. If she thinks my friends are jerks, then I'm a *jerk*...
'scuse me. I uh, I was in here this morning and uh, I believe I paid you with a twenty dollar bill, (smiles) but you only gave me change for a ten.
all right! rock-climbing! J..just the 2 of us? alright! hey I'll make some sandwiches, what what do you like? tuna? peanut butter?
Alright, c'mon, scooch over. (Tries to squeeze into the corner seat of the couch and struggles with Remy. He spills his glass of grape juice all over the couch in the process.)
Thank you Mr.Farkus, thank you very much indeed sir.
Seemingly. Seemingly, to the untrained eye, I can fully understand how you got that impression. What looked like pushing...what looked like knocking down...was a safety precaution! In a fire, you stay close to the ground, am I right? And when I ran out that door, I was not leaving anyone behind! Oh, quite the contrary! I risked my life making sure that exit was clear. Any other questions?
Well, Play Now is through playing. They turned the heat way up in my office. They tried to sweat me out.
The... drivel... parts. Oh my gosh, I just realized  I have to make a phone call. I-I cant believe- Would you-
Yes! I'm not giving him the satisfaction, it's my space.
What if her experience with me *drove* her to it?
All right we got the wine. Aren't we lucky? We got wine. Whoopee Whoa! Imagine if we didn't bring the wine. We'd be shunned by society. Outcasts! WHERE'S YOUR WINE? GET OUT!
You know what? It doesn't matter, because I quit!
Don't you see. Women like that are like, members of a secret tribe living in a forbidden city. People like me have not been inside in thousands of years.. But with this, it's like I've already been with one of her own! My hands been stamped! I come and go as I please!
Then afterwards maybe we could all go out together. Y'know she'll see me with my friends, she'll observe me as I really am, as myself. Maybe I can get some hand that way.
Shhh What is wrong with you? You never tell 'em you like the car. (Advising) You're not sure what you want. You don't even know why you're here.
Tennis courts? W-w-what about the yard? Where do they have the gang fights?
I mean, now she thinks that I'm one of these guys that love her. Nobody wants to be with somebody that loves them.
Well don't let him take advantage of you like that.
Oh yeah.. (Starts to open it) Sally called Susan - said you guys really hit it off.
Madam? What are you calling me madam for?
How you gonna catch him? He's probably boarded the plane already.
It gets here when it gets here. Would you stop ridin' me?
(indicating the window) Kramer, it's, it's raining. They got the tarp on the field.
(Talking about his would-be apartment) You could fit 15 people in that bathroom..
Ya it used to be right in the middle of single Jeopardy and now they do it right after single Jeopardy.
Anything, everything, something, nothing - Who the hell cares? Put me down. I'm down!
Oh ho! Class, huh? At Columbia? Let me tell you something, pal. I called the registrars office. I checked you out. They have no record of a Ray Thomas at that school! You liar!
And Ill tell you something else, Im not even going to ask you. I want to know. But Im not gonna ask. Youll tell me when you feel comfortable. So what was it? Four hundred? Five hundred? Did you pay five hundred for this? (Jerry coyly ignores Georges questions, while George grows increasingly serious.) Over six? Cant be seven. Dont tell me you paid seven hundred dollars for this jacket! Did you pay seven hundred dollars for this jacket? Is that what youre saying to me? You are sick! Is that what you paid for this jacket? Over seven hundred? What did you pay for this jacket?! I wont say anything. I wanna know what you paid for this jacket! Oh my God! A thousand dollars?! You paid a thousand dollars for this jacket?! All right, fine. (George heads for the door.) Im walking outta here right now thinking you paid a thousand dollars for this jacket, unless you tell me different. (Jerry remains silent.) Oh, ho! All right! Ill tell you what, if you dont say anything in the next five seconds, Ill know it was over a thousand.
I have to get in touch with Tatiana! And look at his little outfit. It's all so coordinated, the way his socks matching to his shirt. I really hate this guy.
Oh. Oh. Yeah, sure. Here. Uh, sit down. Uh, uh, cheese, there? (he grabs a suit jacket from the desk chair and puts it on)
Yeah. Yeah. With all that kissing and the shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy out in public like that. It's disgusting!
Ha Ho! (he turns and walks out the door)
I think Play Now is putting something in my food.
I didn't even know Fulton was in the hospital.
You know. (All three give him blank stares) I was alone..
Oh of course you can use it, sure. (Jerry saying stuff through the phone) Ok, bye. (hangs the phone up)
(sarcasm) Hu-hu, like I don't know that? (excitement) My Cousin Vinnie, I love that! I, George Costanza, could be on a date with an Oscar winner! An Oscar winner, Jerry! You know what that's like? It's like if fifty years ago, someone fixed me up with Katherine Hepburn? Same thing!
I'll tell you what's wrong, a grown woman with a male roommate! It's unnatural, it's an abomination!
(to salesman) Well, maybe you could show me something else.
I like sports. I could do something in sports.
Yes, In fact, her mother is in the hospital right now. It's some kind of a Diverticulitis. (he continues walking slowly towards Steinbrenners desk)
Let me just say this. It is inhumane to make a man stand on his feet, in one spot for eight hours a day. Why shouldn't he have a chair?
Yes, I, uh, I need to return this book.
I leave you alone for two seconds, and this is what you do! I trusted you!
Thanks a lot. I'm really late. My parents are waiting in front of my building and we're stuck here.
If anybody should be getting more it's you.
Hey, what happened with Sandy. I forgot all about it. Did you call her?
What happened to the screen door? It blew off again?
Well, Jerry's car gets hit and the other driver doesn't have any insurance, so the judge
Yes! I mean, if she thinks that's me she's under a complete misapprehension. That was not me, Jerry. That was not me.
How's this for criticism? Um...you stink. How do like that criticism? You know what's funny to me? That diploma up on the wall. That is my idea of "com-med-dee"! You sitting here, telling people what to do.
rush? you want a rush? drop a ball on your toe my friend, talk about a rush, you'll be throbbing, you'll see visions
Oh (snorts) Articulate....Me? I've never articulated anything, i'm completely incoherent.
I'd argue if I could, Mrs. Enright. (exits) Here we go, all right.
Oh, no...no, that's very bad for the kidneys.
Lunch is fine at the beginning then you move on to dinner. you don't move back to lunch. It's like being demoted. I'll never do another crossword puzzle with her again. I know it.
You know how hot it gets there? Like 150 degrees. Your skin is gonna be simmering with boils.
Oh yes I am Father. Incredibly sincere. So, uh, pffft, am I in?
Ha ha. Everything's timed out to perfection, Jerry. Slippery Pete's got the Frogger running on battery power, the truck will be there any minute, and Kramer's taped out the loading zone.
Funny, cause I happen to be very good friends with Keith Hernandez.
"To the victor goes the spoils." What are you going to do tonight?
(Sarcastically) What's the competition, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang?
Lo..k, if you want to taste mine, you don't have to offer me some of yours.
I told her. In the kitchen  which was risky cause its near all the knives. I started with the word Listen.
(animated) Some guy. Some guy? Neil! I have got to find out how he could get a girl like Danielle.
Yes, because the water was cold... and the chewing warms me up.
Well, I was exaggerating a bit, just for effect.
You could take the IQ test for me. I could pass it to you out a window. We could do it, she lives in the first floor.
Because, Jerry, it's a couple rule! We have to tell each other everything!
Yeah, what is he? Some sort of an instigator?
No. She tried to give me the "it's not you, it's me" routine.
He-he was uh touching and rubbing. (nervous laugh)
(Like a kid) Because I don't want to.
He did it right as he said "her unfortunate accident."
A plane crash? A Heart attack? Lupus? Is it Lupus?
Why doesn't *he* pick you up after the operation. He's got the car with the bench seats that you like.
What is with this dog, I thought we were taking it to the pound.
An apartment complex, the uh the Eiffel Towers. uumm Like I said uh you'll be getting a postcard uh in a few days and again I'm sorry.
Really? And Debby told me that she fell in love with him because he has all this perspective!
Y'know, now you gotta ask her her name. It's so embarrassing.
Christie? That's the one you met in the antique store?
Well, we're collectors. We, uh, see objects of great beauty and, uh, we must have them.
What about the whole Christmas spirit thing? Any flexability there?
I can't eat this without catsup. Would it kill her to check up on us? Would that be a terrible thing? "How's everything? Do you need anything? What can I do for you?"
No. I wouldnt even have to tell her. I could surprise her.
Amazing. I drive them to lesbianism, he brings 'em back.
I can't carry a pen. I'm afraid I'll puncture my scrotum.
Hey Elaine. (George hangs up his raincoat next to the door) Im telling you Jerry, having a secretary is incredible. (George claps hands) I don't know why I didnt have one before.
Just a suggestion. (chuckles and walks back to the yelling guy)
Okay, so you remember I made the initial call Sunday, she doesnt call back. I call again Monday, I leave another message. I call Tuesday, I get the machine again, I know youre there, I dont know what your story is. Yesterday, Im a volcano  I try one more call, the machine comes on, and I let fly like Mussolini from the balcony, Where the hell do you get the nerve? You invite me up for coffee and then you dont call me back for four days? I dont like coffee, I dont have to come up. Id like to get one more shot at the coffee just so I could spit it in your face.
Oh Shut up! What are you doing back so soon, anyway? (puts the tape back in it's case.)
Not really. Your voice kind of raises to this comedic pitch. (Kramer enters)
Well, they hurt him bad. Really hurt his feelings. It's a long story. I- I don't like to talk about it, but I swore then that I would never work for big broker-houses. See, all they care about is money. I'm about more than money, I'm about people, always gone my own way and I've never looked back.
I-I just don't react well to these situations. My grandmother died two months early because of the way I reacted in the hospital. She was getting' better. And then I went to pay her a visit. She saw my face. BOOM. That was the end of it.
(pointedly) She could do a lot worse than Mr Peanut, my friend.
No, that's my only suit. It cost me 350 dollars. I got it at Moe Ginsburg.
She probably gets that impression because you're cool. You're under control. Like me. Nothing wrong with that.
So, uh, how long has this been going on?
I'll tell you what happened. I bet he got the AM/PM mixed-up.
(handing over a bill) Can I get a pack of gum, please?
Then why don't you try and get him another job?
What, you're gonna take her word over mine? I'm your best friend!
What did you put the Pez dispenser on her leg for in the first place?
Alright. Listen, I gotta get some reading done. You mind if I do this here? I can't concentrate in my apartment.
(Defensively) You can look at them, but do NOT touch them. (Holds them out)
Well it's not fair, Jerry. It's just not fair. All right, all right. That's it. I'm getting out of this thing.
Oh, there's a soup stand, Kramer's been going there.
(Snaps, then points to the coffee table) Hand me an Emory board.
Well... what if you showed up bad naked, huh? You still got that belt sander?
What am I going to do now? I can't live without Susan. I gotta get her back. How? How, am I gonna get her back?
Ooooo, I'm scared. . . . Ohoooo they're not going to do the show.
You know what you oughta do. You should go to her office and heckle her.
Oh, okay. (Starts to walk other way and then walks to their room and goes in)
All right, Kramer that's it.....( pushes the camera) Hello . English. Does anyone speak English
What a bald paradise that must have been. Nobody knew.
I kept looking at her face. Id go, Cmon, love her. Love her!
(upset) Could you put a little thought into this? Jerry's gone, you could humour me. He humours me.
(improvising) My uh uncle is having an operation. I just wanted to see how he was.
That's right! He never apologized to me for saying that I would stretch out the neck hole of his sweater.
Now, you see, I don't get that. We had a relaxed stimulating, great conversation, she doesn't mention it? Why doesn't she mention it?
Just the last few innings of a double-header.
Oh, deserve! I don't know if I deserve...I mean...
Whatever. Believe me, if I wasn't involved right now, I wouldn't mind being set up. Something tells me she's a knockout. (we see, from the camera inside the cab, George's hand waving as the cab drives away)
Yeah, Like I don't know that I'm pathetic.
This is fantastic. Man, what a weekend. Swimming, lobster for dinner...
Oh, please. (to the teller) Can you change this into bills?
Well, we were engaged to be married, uh, we bought the wedding invitations, and, uh, yada yada yada, I'm still single.
Well nothing. I didn't actually say that. (Karen is still laughing)
(Holding camera) Look at this, I only have one picture left... How 'bout a shot of me and Mr. Morgan?
What do you think? The brought it over in pieces and screwed it together like a coffee table?
I'm very nervous about this. I've never spoken to a mental patient before.
(laughs - hehe) Well, first, I'm brushing my teeth and this piece of apple-skin, that must have been lodged in there for days, comes loose.
What? The guy asked you to HELP HIM MOVE? Wow.
(Frantic) Kramer, do you know what those guys are gonna do to me?!
Look...humm..I'm on with Beijing with the hair restauration clinic. Could you talk to them for me and tell them I'd like to place an order.
So what? Somebody dropped an egg on my head as I went into my building last night.
Could we talk about this some other time?
(frustrated) Take it easy! Huh! Take it easy!
I've done the march in. Best feeling in the world.
Well, people never give a good 'hello' at a funeral. I mean, they go like this (George gives an extremely understated nod) That's the biggest.
You know, I can't talk to you anymore.
Let's see, How I'm very good at going in reverse in my car, why isn't Postum a more popular drink,
So, tell him you're concerned about it and he should see someone else.
When are they gonna have the flying cars, already?
This is the life! Isn't it, huh, kid?
Ah ha, well, I really wouldn't know about that. I don't watch much TV. I like to read. So what do you do, a lot of that "did you ever notice?" this kind of stuff.
Yeah. Yeah. It's the only way. Come on. What are you, kidding me?
(Quickly making it up) Well, possibly. I wrote an off-Broadway show, "La Cocina." ..Actually, it was off-off-Broadway. It was a comedy about a Mexican chef.
try shaking it...(long pause) Well,Janet should be here any minute.
Thinking? Nothing. What could I possibly be thinking?
Then I got off the phone right away.
(holding his cane) I gotta hobble. (walks out)
Payroll project. Wilhelm? Big uh, big payroll project.
You can't do that, it's none of your business!
Well, I'm gonna go back there later and return it when there's different people working.. You want to catch a movie?
Yeah. Hey, you know, I gotta go get these tomatoes. You wanna go for a ride?
You think she could be an 'it'? Could she be an 'it'?
Is that what I ask for? The BIG salad?
Why didn't you just wear a heavier coat?
Well, she's smart. You take my word for it.
All right. All right. Let's not get into panic mode! Let's not make a big deal outta this thing or we're never gonna get through this night.
Its my money. What should I do? Throw it out the window? I know a guy who took his vacation on his change.
I'm sorry. I can't live knowing Ted Danson makes that much more than me. Who is he?
Jerry. Marla. (Realizing Jerry's cue) Stacey! (Walks over to Stacey)
You think your parents would have any objections to taking a little kid to Paris with them? (Jerry looks at him confused) It turns out that the kid's father lives in Paris. (chuckling) Is that a coincidence? (Jerry smilies) Eh you know Alec wants me to take him over there so I figure as long as they're going (claps)
Well, I guess these would be out of the question. (pulls out two pudding skins in plastic bags.)
What do you mean? The engagement is off, we get the TV back. That's business.
Excuse me, are you gonna be very long?
(to Kramer) Ah! You're just the man I'm looking for.
Well, it's a tough decision. I have to wear these every day. I'm deciding on a new face.
You're not going to get back here in time!
Yes. Very nice to have had her to mention... (starting to leave)
Uh, it was dangling! There were only two left in the machine! He mustve bought one, and gotten both.
...yeah, my wife started getting on me about the lawn today. Im tellin you, its one thing after another.
When are they gonna learn that any news about China is an instant page-turner? (seeing Jerry with a small black device) What's that?
Um, hi, its George, George Costanza, remember me? The guy that didnt come up for coffee. You see, I didnt realise that coffee didnt really mean... well, whatever. Anyway, it was fun. It was... it was fun, so... oh boy, um, so... You call me back. If you want. Its up to you, you know, whatever you wanna do. Either way. The balls in your court. So uh, take it easy.
And you know what else I've decided to do? I'm going to keep seeing the bald woman.
(Getting in a more panicked state) Oh God, Mommy!
Ha! Ha! Hey! (moving his arms like it's so great to be all here)
Cross the wires? I can't even make a pot of spaghetti.
You know my driver's waiting, I really should get running. Good to see you guys again.
(animated) What're you kidding me? We were all getting along so well. Where is all this coming from?
Well, how good a look did you get?
You know, that, that thing about her being too good for him. I mean, I was just bein' folksy. They could tell I was just being folksy..?
So, attractive one day - not attractive the next?
If I do it, will you buy a computer?
Come on 'Oh George, oh Geeeooorge!' Come on! Not that I don't appreciate the effort that was put into it.
Me? It wasn't me I never even saw the ball. All you do is dribble.
(picking up what Frank saw as a mouse) It's the remote.
What do you mean "might"? You don't think he really owned this car?
Mmm, no. Boy, it really didn't come out too well, did it?
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I used to come here all the time with my fiance, back when it was a meat-packing plant. Ha. Here's her picture. (hands her a magazine page)
I still won't be able to forgive myself - but at least it won't be about this.
(Interrupts) And I still say hes naked under there!
Didja see the way she was looking at me?
Do you see what this is turning in to? Do I need this. I have to get out of this thing.
An apartment-warming gift? We got to give presents to people for moving? Birthdays, Christmas, it's enough gifts. I would like one month off.
I mean, uh... I had fun ice skating.
(Annoyed) Yeah, yeah. We'll, uh, let you know.
Can I say one word to you? Lobster. The lobster here is unbelievable. (looks at the menu) Ooh, a little expensive.
Oh, no, no. Twix is the only candy with the cookie crunch.
Hey hey hey, we're in a rush here.
Was she uh, was she a big, uh woman?
What was the tallest woman you ever slept with?
We could be zipping all over the place.
How much tip do you leave on $8.15?
This hat just bottles in the heat, I -I don't even need a coat! It's unbelievable!
I know but I couldn't think of anything else to say to her.
I didn't shave this morning. I don't feel like myself.
(Breathing deeply) That's very dirty. (Jerry nods) That's absolutely filthy.
(attacking Kramer) How could you give me a defective condom?!
uh.. maana? huh maana might.. huh maana might be a problem, I'm supposed to have huh a boil lanced maana. Huh you know I think they charge me if I cancel with only one maana's notice
I could never do that. You know the ironic thing is if she had a smaller nose, I never could have gone out with her in the first place. She'd be out of my league with a smaller nose. And I really like her, I know that. And I know one other thing. I'm not getting past that nose.
(Not sure what the answer should be) What do you want to hear?
It became very clear to me sitting out there today, that every decision I've ever made, in my entire life, has been wrong. My life is the complete opposite of everything I want it to be. Every instinct I have, in every of aspect of life, be it something to wear, something to eat ... It's all been wrong. (chuckles) Everywhere.
Robin, listen to me. The most amazing thing has happened. Kramer has opened my eyes. I think I've changed.
"Ah! your just mad 'cause we beat ya."
You know my last name is Costanza. That's Italian. So you and I are like country men. Pisano's!
No, no, no... Just a *tiny* bit... It's not even *frontal* nudity. It's... *sidal* nudity...
No. Now I'll always have this doubt about the car. What, your jaw still hurts?
Rudy?! That skunk, I knew he didn't burn those clothes.
No, but I can tell she's going to. I can sense it. We had this terrible phone conversation. I was so nervous before I called I made up this whole list of things to talk about.
(Laughs) Steven, nothing is higher than an architect.
I've always liked her. Remember her in 'Carnal Knowledge'?
(getting animated) Look I, I uh, I had nothing to do with this. It wasn't my decision. It was Jerry! Jerry told me no. I'm the creative guy. He handles the business end.
I don't even like to use urinals, always been a stall man.
Well ...... but how do I get someone else fired?
Oh, I'll pay. Half-price. Arrivederci my fellow 40-short.
The nice one that works in my office.
Anyway, as I was lying in the puddle, I-I think I may have found a way for us to get Bonds and Griffey, and we wouldn't have to give up that much.
The parakeet in the mirror. That's a good one, Stu.
Right! And these pigeons broke the deal. I will not accept the blame for this!
All right. Okay, tell me what you think about this idea Extend the doors on the toilet stalls at Yankee Stadium all the way to the floor.
Well, I shouldn't have to pay for it!
I never should have brought her up there. Should have known better. Should have seen it coming. I didn't see it coming.
So now, the father is screaming at me, he's demanding that I pay for the boom box. Finally, I gave them a fake address and got the hell out of there.
(Concerned) Why're you doing this, Jerry? Is it your career? Things will pick up.
[to himself] Hey, whatd'ya know? Look at that! A *lesbian* sighting. Oh-ho! My lucky day. They're *so* fascinating. Why is that? Because they don't want us. You gotta respect that...
Speak now, or we are headed to the Hamptons. It's a two-hour drive. Once you get in that car, we are going all the way... to the Hamptons. All right, you wanna get nuts? Come on. Let's get nuts!
What are these? (Holds test tubes to his head like antennae) Take me to your leader.
I don't understand, how do these thieves start the car?
We did a crossword puzzle together, *in bed*. It was the most fun I ever had in my entire life. Did you hear me? in my *life*! Y'know?
Wait a minute, wait, it's not that stupid.
...and, and maybe shell see me when she gets there, does this woman intend to spend time with me?
I'm, uh, George Costanza. I was having dinner with your son.
Yeah, hold on. I'm, uh, I'm just trying to get a reading on my dashboard compass. Where are my parents?
What, you didn't ask him about the car?
On an elevator? You met a woman on an elevator?
Jerry, could you excuse us for a few minutes, please?
Well anyway, the, uh... the stone is up, I paid my respects, guess that's it.
(upset) But you can't stay here. There's no place to sleep!
Jerry, just remember. It's not a lie... if you believe it.
Id like a doggie bag for this please. (hands her plate to the waitress)
Its an incredible deal. I dont know why you dont come with me.
(As the Twix starts to move) Ha, ha, ha, ha! (The Twix gets stuck in the spindle right before falling. George begins to pound the machine) Come on! Jump!
Who do I like? I, like, uh, Art, Vandelay.
(Snapping) Is that important, really? What is this, a police investigation? The woman's been through enough. She has to relive the experience now?!
But I know who took the bite. It was her aunt!
Chamberlind, you could hold his head in nthe toilet, he'd still give you half of Europe.
Jerry, I'm not suggesting getting rid of the girl. She's integral.
Ladies. I, uh, I haven't seen this before.
Whoop! Too late. I think he picked up the scent.
Have you seen Jerry? (sitting beside Elaine) I told him two o'clock.
What, you're gonna pass up a wonderful opportunity to put that aloe pusher in her place?
Dad, he doesn't need to see the pole.
(broaching a subject) Hey mom. What kind of woman was grandma?
So what could I do? I couldn't go through with it. She threatened to kill herself.
Busy. Don't give me busy. Who's not busy? I'm busy, we're all busy, everybody's busy. All right, tell me, what's kept you so busy?
So call her up and tell her to bring you another one. She'll be delighted to talk to you.
(from bathroom) VANDELAY, SAY VANDEL... (George falls) ... Vandelay Industries, ...
Are you crazy? This is like discovering Plutonium ... by accident.
Y'know people, we got a situation over here!
Sometimes at restaurants she talks to her food 'Ooh, Mr. Mashed Potatoes, you are sooo goood.'
Never mind. The're done. All I have to do now is redo them. You know if you take everything I've ever done in my entire life and condense it down into one day, it looks decent.
Aah, hey. (enthusiastic) If this works out, forget about it. Vacations together, movies together, dinner together. It..it's almost as good as if I didn't get married.
(While skimming a Monk's menu) You know, I didn't go to the bathroom the entire time we were in India.
You could pet them. They come right out of the water onto the sidewalks.
I gotta call her. Should I call her?
Wait, wait a second, what are you doing?
Must be one of those rich, spoiled handicapped people, who didn't want to do any work, and just wanted to sit in her wheelchair and take it easy.
oh, . . .because she handed you the bag. I could have handed you the bag. She happened to pick it up at the restaurant even though, . . .
(smiling) Listen, I..I..I don't mean to seem forward...
I dont know. But Simons said that if I wanted to get involved, that Wilkinson would tell me the exact right minute to sell. You wanna do it?
I think I was affected by the caffeine.
I'm George.. George Costanza.. I've never been in the hospital a day in my life.. except when I had my tonsils out. You know, they never gave me any ice cream. I always felt that-
She invited me up. Coffees not coffee, coffee is sex.
Puke! That's a funny word. Puke. (laughing) Puke! Don't have to think about that.
Kramer, Kramer, I need to know if Nina is refunding.
Yes, for a sales position. Latex salesman, the selling of latex, and latex related products. They just wouldn't give me a chance.
Do you feel funny? He didn't say anything.
Ho, ho, ho! Hes got a live one. Hes just reeling his big fish in!
I can't believe I missed Kramer. You know he asked me to go with him to California.
Well, it's just a game. Remember that, kids.
Hey uh, isn't Elaine supposed to meet us?
You cant be serious. This is New York city. There must be eleven million decent hotel rooms! Whatta you need? A flag? (waving his handkerchief) This is the signal, Jerry, this is the signal!
All right, do you mind? I have the window! (To Willie) Now, what are you gonna do about my Twix?
(Needing to get away from his parents, he gets up) I need some air..
Maybe you don't have to be so funny. I mean, would it kill you not to be so funny all the time? That's all I'm asking. This woman thinks I'm very funny. Now you're gonna be funny, so what am I gonna be? I'm gonna be a short bald guy with glasses who suddenly doesn't seem so funny.
And people come in the store and you get involved in their lives.
He mentioned my name?! What did he say?!
Just take it off. I'm getting hot just looking at it.
Well, that interests me very much Mr. Farkus.Very much indeed, sir.
Don't you see. She's looking at my pictures.
There was no meeting. (gets one of the folding chairs) But it was quite a meeting. You are looking at the next director of Mets scouting. The only thing is, I have to get fired from the Yankees first.
They could kick me out of the health club if he tells them!
Guess who he put in charge of Fitted Hat Day? Me.
All right, that's enough. I gotta go home and take a nap.
(pleading) Elaine, c'mon. Would you just make the call? (indicates the phone) Please, make the call.
Yeah, fun. IQ tests are totally bogus. They prove nothing.
Nothing. Uh, I don't know. I gotta go.
Why did you even take it? You broke up with her!
That reminds me, I'm not getting you guys any more fruit. That guy was eyeballing me the whole time. He gave me the creeps. All right, you owe me twenty-eight sixty.
I can't go in there. Im too uncomfortable.
It doesn't matter if it's more comfortable. It's wrong.
Two tickets to "Guys And Dolls"! I'm gonna go with you!
Yeah. I am like a drug dealer. I got the guy hooked. I am having lunch at his desk everyday this week. He doesn't make a move without me. It's very exciting.
It's, uh, it's not a little chicken. (laughing) Little chicken. It's a gamebird.
I was just blowin' off a little steam. So what?
UH, ha ha, ... It's just SO frustrating. It's a brand new jacket.
(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o. (Hes sitting on the floor in his Play Now office).
All right Mrs. S. I and my good pal Keith Hernandez will be right back.
Y'know, I'm better with the mothers than I am with the daughters.
I look like me and I'm working from the outside. Who do you think is in the better position?
What's he yelling about? They're stealing jackets here!
I gave. I gave everything I could Mrs. Sokol. but nothing was good enough for her.
No no no, this ones different. This ones a beauty!
(walking back) Are you sure? 'Cause it could really help me out of a jam.
Somebody double parked and blocked us in. D-DOES ANYBODY KNOW WHOSE CAR THAT IS? Maybe there's a note on it. Ohh-oh brother. No, no note. Can you believe this?
Assistant to the travelling secretary. (fishing for a reaction) I'm uh, working on the project.
But if you think about it...26 teams, 162 games a season, you'd think eventually an entire team would get wiped out.
Oh oh oh, all right, fine, Jerry, you win. Take it, just take it!
And now for the trifecta. (Picks up a hand held TV and gets back under the covers.)
(taking it out of his jacket pocket) yeah I got some sandwiches.. I got tuna.. and salmon salad Tony because I know you don't like peanut butter
This is the thing where you go and you have to make your own pizza?
(shifty, avoiding Jerry's eyes) Fine, fine. (he removes his coat)
Hi. I'm ah, I'm here to see a Mr. Art Vandelay..
(puts down handset) Because he'll know I told you. Besides, he's giving me a parking spot around the corner for practically nothing.
They will get a good home won't they?
No, it's a Newman. Well, I gotta run. (Smiles, pats his briefcase and exits.)
I don't think so, Vic. I've done my homework. '89 Volvo, that's the car for me, it's the one I want.
Rid? Nah, c'mon, the word is 'care'. Care. I care about your comfort, be it here in Queens or twelve-hundred miles away.
(angry that she believes Al was right) No he's not right. Al Netchie is not right! Alright I'm canceling the father-son picnic. I don't know what he's gonna do with all that potato salad.
And, Ill have a club soda with no ice.
Come on. Ya wanna go get some lunch?
Oh, I found him. He was sitting on the steps of the library. I sat down next to him. He smelled like the locker room after that game against Erasmus
(to Jerry, yelling) You told her? She's not your wife!
Just because you have someone's spare keys, it doesn't entitle you to break into their apartment. That's the reason you took away Kramer's keys.
No, you're not a divorcee. Youre just separated. You're---you're a separatee.
No something is bunk and then you debunk it.
(thinking) Oh my God, it's 701. What have I done? My whole plan is depending on Kramer? Have I learned nothing? How could I make such a stupid mistake? He'll never show up!
I like this area. I could live out here.
(Angry) Yeah, that's what they told me the last time.
You know, it's a miracle you're not married. (beat) Hey, I'm not obligated to buy anything, am I?
(Takes two oven mitts from his back pack) Alright, (puts them on) I gotta get going.
(positive) Yes. From endorsing checks for the Super Terrific Happy Hour. (laughs)
Well, I know when I'm a little strapped, I sometimes drop off my rent check having forgotten to sign it. That could buy us some time.
Youre a back-up, youre a second-line, a just-in-case, a B-plan, a contingency!
(to Elaine) Right, alright. (to Jerry) Oh Jerry, do you have any apples?
Yes, it is consistent. I've, uh, I've tried to maintain a consistent feel throughout the house.
What are you, Crazy? I can't ask the guy for more cigars after you burned down his cabin!
Jerry, I can't talk to Jerry anymore. Ever since he moved into that apartment he's too much ... like you.
Anywhere in the city - I'll tell you the best public toilet.
Well I don't want to get into a big dispute about the pants.
Hey, so get this. I get a call this morning from one of the Mets front office guys. They wanna take me out to lunch.
What are you up to now, uh, Step Nine?
Okay, look, Audrey, before you take the bandage off just remember that I was the one that encouraged you to do this, you know? Now that you're gonna be a great beauty, let's not forget how this all began. You know, like if you'd listened to your friend, Elaine,
I need like a bucket of water! I got a car overheating, I got an alarm that won't go off, I'm pressing 'one', I'm pressing 'two', nothing! What do I do?! Help me! Help me!
Hey, hey, hey! You don't call me back?!
(Still with a tone) He is. You dont know what Im doin here.
I love these people, you can't ask 'em questions. (getting excited) They're so mentally gifted that we mustn't disturb the delicate genius unless it's in the confines of an office. (worked up) When huge sums of money are involved, then the delicate genius can be disturbed!
I got a message from the Rosses at work today.
I-I don't get these birds! They're breaking the deal. It-it's like the pigeons decided to ignore me!
Oh, sports are so pedestrian. I've prepared some science experiments that will illuminate the mind and dazzle the eye.
Well, after dinner last week, she invites me back to her apartment.
I wanna bite into a big hunk of cheese, just bite into it like it's an apple.
Oh, she's a Kramer. And uh, while I was there I uh happened to pick up another juicy little nugget about our friend.
Oh, I was uh, I was waiting downstairs for the jackhammer, thought I'd drop by.
This is all too much. So what are you feeling? What's going on? Are you like a couple again now?
(Inquiring about the chalk board) What is this?
I know, I know...don't skimp. Go go go go...
A garden! I cant believe theres a garden!
It's like Im thinking of something, and you're (snaps fingers) one step ahead of me.
You know, I could let it go for.. say.. a hundred and twenty-five.
You got a line in the Woody Allen movie?
Alright, alright! We'll buy her a wheelchair! Wheelchairs, engagement presents.. IT NEVER ENDS!
So you really understand my point about building a rocket and double-parking.
There you go, okay? That's my *other* friend's ticket. You happy now? You got two tickets.
I'd love to be a Civil War buff. ... What do you have to do to be a buff
No, listen; we are always sitting here, I am always helping you with your girl problems and you are helping me with my girl problems. Where do we end up?
...So, anyway, if you think about it, manure is not really that bad a word. I mean, it's 'newer', which is good, and a 'ma' in front of it, which is also good. Ma-newer , right?
(penny drops) Oh, uh, wait a minute, wait a minute. (snorts) Is this about money?
Oh, what? What? That? Are you kidding? I didn't quit. What? You took that seriously?
All right, Puddy, listen, and listen good I need to know the name of that mechanic that walks around here. Big guy, a liar. Short name. Sam? Moe? Sol?!
Why? Why isn't it possible? I mean, they're both bite marks.
We have no need to speak. We communicate with deep soulful looks.
(on phone  calling secretary) Hello Margery, George Costanza. How are you sweet heart? Listen, can you give Mr. Thomassoulo a message for me? Yes. If he needs me, tell him (screams) IM IN MY OFFICE! Thanks.
Theyre the ones who should be ashamed. They signed me to a one-year contract. As long as I show up for work every day, they have to pay me.
You're not a doctor. You shouldn't even have books like this.
You know the anxiety you feel on a date? That's what I have every day now. My worst nightmare's come true, every day is a date.
(to himself) A cane. I knew it. (to Neil) So, we meet at last. I admire your skills, Mr Peanut.
Got it. (the waitress walks away) Did you just see what happened here?
I could go bumper to bumper with any one else on this planet!
Mister Seinfeld? What about Mister Costanza? I'm not here?
I got two tickets to see "Guys And Dolls".
Oh, no, no...condoms are for single men. The day that we got engaged, I said goodbye to the condom forever.
Do you know what happens if I miss him? I don't get credit for the pickup and I lose my 50 bucks...
I can't tell ya now , he's gonna be back in a ten seconds.
??? KNOCK OFFS. I NOT GOING TO DO IT! AND YOU'RE GOING TO CALL STEINBRENNER BACK AND CANCEL THE WHOLE THING.
Howbout Kramer or Elaine, they don't want them?
Well, I'm doing it, Jerry. I'm buying the Frogger machine. Now the torch will burn forever.
I dont think theres ever been an appointment in my life where I wanted the other guy to show up. (George notices an elderly man in a leather chair.) Wait a second, is that him?
Yeah, people who work at NORAD, whore on twenty-four hour missile watch. Everything was going along so great. She was laughing, I was funny... I kept saying to myself, Keep it up, dont blow it, youre doing great.
Well, they get very hot in the polyester. You know, it's not a natural fibre. I think they would prefer cotton.
Officer, could I just explain something to you?
Alright look, I'm gonna tell you, but I made a pact with Cynthia, we swore we were not going to tell you and Elaine.
(melancholy) I wish that was all needed. Life can be so confusing. I..I'm searching for answers, anywhere.
Well, you know, if I uh, wasn't engaged.
Listen Sheila it's not what you think. I put my trust into the wrong person. He said the key word was tasteful.
Yeah, yeah. She's seeing this guy, Art Vandelay.
There's elevators all over! It all looks the same.
Bender? He cant play left. He stinks. I just dont see what purpose is it gonna serve your going? I mean, you think dead peole care whos at their funeral? They dont even know theyre having a funeral. Its not like shes hanging out in the back going, I cant believe Jerry didnt show up.
(forced buoyancy) Hey, you know, let's call Susan, we'll go have coffee.
This is amazing. (George gets up to leave and shake's man's hand) Thank you. Thank you very much. . . . I'm going back in! . . . You'll feel better (to woman)
Do you know the last time I wore this thing? Six years ago, when I made that toast at Bobby Leighton's wedding.
You're fresh (grabs her arm) You're very fresh. You seem very fresh to me. You're very vital. I couldn't take you any fresher.
Do you think it would be better if I did?
Yo, dad. This is my boss, Mr. Kruger.
Yeah, yeah, well, because of the cane. You should see the bathroom they gave me!
Well I'm not starting up a whole new wardrobe now!!!
I'm bored. She's boring, I'm boring, we're both boring. We got out to eat, we both read newspapers.
What are we gonna do? How are we gonna get out of here?
I have to talk to Elaine. This cleaing lady is turning the screws on me. She's pushing for this whole relationship thing. She keeps calling me, threatening to go to the boss with this thing, I could lose my job, I gotta do something to keep her quiet.
And I cancelled plans to go to the movies with them tonight.
A guy leaves a puddle of sweat, that's a signal?
So, I'm gonna steal another one, and then return it. That way, everything is even.
She's off. (goes over to the now available public phone)
Yes, she's pretty. What difference does it make?
Wait, wait. Here me out. Don't dismiss this. You're very quick to dismiss. Don't dismiss. She's got a big crush on David Letterman, I mean, a big crush. She talks about him all the time. Suppose I go up to David Letterman. He works at NBC; I work at NBC. I explain my situation. He agrees to meet her. They go out, they fall madly in love. And she dumps me for David Letterman.
What're you doing? What're you, telling secrets? What're you laughing at?
So, whaddya say? You know you'll always be the only man I'll ever love.
Once, to a dog. He licked himself and left the room.
Wait a minute Jerry, there's a bigger issue here. If you go through that wall and become one of those guys I'll be left here on this side. Take me with you.
Uh, I'm just selling some of Dad's things, (looking into Kramer's eyes) that's what he would have wanted.
Ewings hurt? How long is he going to be out?
Now, I'm aware that my own physical dimensions are perhaps a little short of perfection.
Baah! There it is! You just said it! That's what I want! Now say it again, and tell it to me.
(Very loud in the direction of a waiter) I'm gonna need a coffee here. Very hot! Boiling!
What, ... you are making some wisecracks in a night club... wo wo wo. The guy was in game SIX two runs down two outs facing elimination.
I didn't get the special, but I'd also like the fresh fruit too.
I was so shocked I was lucky I said anything.
Well how do you even know its hers? Maybe it belonged to Carol. Did you see a name on the tube?
No Don't get the camera , we don't need the camera. Listen I know your skeptical , but I really believe in the Chinese.
Ah, this is the kind of day that almost makes you feel good to be alive.
(on a pay phone) Hey, hey, it's George, I need ya to do me a favor.
Why don't you give me the twenty, and I'll stop and get change, and then you and I can... uh... you-know, settle.
He's an obscure writer. Betnik, on the village.
Well, I can't walk anywhere now. I'm just gonna be wishing there were walkways. (seeing Elaine removing her shoe) What are you doing?
Nothing, why? You think something's wrong? Am I different?
I can't perform under pressure. That's why I never play anything for money, I choke. I could choke tonight. And she works in my office, can you imagine? She goes around telling everyone what happened? Maybe I should cancel, I have a very bad feeling about this.
What are you? A *baby*!? All right. Tell her.
You know, I think I could have played with dolls if their were dolls in the house. It seems like fun to me. It doesn't seem like a gender thing. I think I would like to play with dolls. What's so terrible?
Ah, I've had everything on the menu. Uh, surprise me.
How could you be a doctor and not say "get outta here"? It should be part of the training at medical school "Cancer? Get outta here!" "Go home! What are you crazy? It's a little test. It's nothing. You're a real nut. You know that?" (Jerry gives him half of his sandwich to hopefully shut him up) I told you that God would never let me be successful. I never should've written that pilot. Now the show will be a big hit, we'll make millions of dollars, and I'll be dead. Dead Jerry. Because of this. (showing his lip)
so, uh, Steven.. I see you're president of the chess club.
Are you kidding? People get spaces this good, they never give em up.
I have noticed she does tend to go to the bathroom right after we finish eating.
Will I call you when I get home? ha ha What do you think? ee, you kill me kill me
Sure. So, uh, Jerry, there's an empty apartment in my building. If you and Hallie want, we could try and hold it, may...
(astounded) What? So, this is still not over?
(Looking at her nose) Is your nose pierced?
Oh, yeah. Still in good with the ground crew. (Laghs)
Get going? But we haven't really, you know....
For 50 bucks? I'd put my face in the soup and blow.
Hey, did you see that whale thing on TV last night?
(proffering glasses) I hope prune juice is alright. It's the only thing I had that was chilled.
Why don't you just look at your watch?
All right, I'll tell you what... why don't you go into the store and I'll wait in the car?
Squirrel? Well, we have no deal with THEM!
(Not amused with her answer) Eggs are eggs. That is very profound. (laughs; Daphne goes back to reading her paper) By the same token you could say fish is fish. Ha ha ha, I don't think so. (pauses) Listen Dophne
Alright, let's see, let's see. What else. What else. Oh yeah, what does she do?
One little wink. She'll freak out, tell my parents. They'll be all over me. Who is this guy?
(still quiet) Never mind, never mind. I need you to do me a favour. Uhm, remember what we were talking about at the coffee shop earlier?
I'm gonna get some more of these kosher cocktail franks.. (leaves)
It's right in the explosion scene. So if you could just...leave me a little window. You know, my, uh, my aunt had a thing removed with a laser. All right, I don't want to interrupt your meal, so...
(takes a large bite - with his mouth still full, his speech is muffled) Oh, this is fabulous.
Well, wait a little while, Ma. What's the difference?
Wait a minute, wait a minute, do you think I?m comfortable here. I can't change, I?ve got no clothes here! You've got to go like that, I can?t go like this alone!
Oh, I wanted to talk to you--I'm sorry, I--didn't know you... (re Donna) had company. (Jerry indicates he should stay) Hiya, I'm George.
And she slaves to earn every penny. So that someday, I might be able to walk up to a woman and say, "Yes, I'm bald, but I'm still a good person."
You told David Putty your move and you didn't tell *me*? I *need* a move. You know I have no moves, Jerry. (points to the candy bar) Gimme a bite.
I went to the beach. (Jerry and Elaine exchange looks)
How much do you tip a chamber maid?
No problem. There's no problem. She just owes me ten dollars, that's all.
Yes, two solariums. Quite a find. And I have horses, too?
Uh, I just went out, I went to look for my friend?
Yes, sir, that was a good sandwich, sir.
Dad, you know what it takes to compete with Microsoft and IBM?
Excuse me Ms. which street are we on?
Because ballpark food doesn't count as real food.
You mean just going there because I'm invited, that's rude?
Yes well unfortunately you'll never get the chance to find out.
I never tasted a cough medicine I didn't love.
How come youre not doin the second show tomorrow?
Well, if he can regift, why can't you degift?
Huh... Cape... (turns, distracted, heads slowly towards door) What was a man with a cape doin' with my father?... What was my father doing with a man in a cape?... (opens door) Why a cape? Hmm! (exits)
(angrily)"WHY WEREN'T YOU MORE CAREFUL WITH YOUR DROOL!"
Because I know him too, and probably a lot better than you.
(removing his glasses) You know, Hawaii could be a little tricky right now, there's a lot of high pressure winds down there this time of year, there's a lot of debris constantly flying around. Wood, and uh, lava, pretty dangerous.
Oh, no no no. Course not. I got a great name for our kids. A real original. You wanna hear what it is? Huh, you ready?
Yes! And I put him up to it, because I'm sick! I'm the one that needs help.
He said he didn't know what it was.
Yes, well, if you had never taken your keys back from Kramer, he never would have taken his back from you and given 'em to me, in which case I wouldn't have had to take mine back from her.
My parents? They don't know *what's* goin' on...
Come on. We got all day tomorrow to come up with a story.
What, I can't stop by and visit my parents? (Drops pamphlet on coffee table)
Why don't we get them a couch? (Kramer laughs) Well rent a U-haul -- well bring em a nice sectional.
(as Jerry and Elaine continue to whine) Give it! Give it! (he finally gets the remote away from them) Pinheads.
Anyway, again, I'm sorry about throwing you out of the car.
Because! Because, as the leader...if I die...then all hope is lost! Who would lead? The clown? Instead of castigating me, you should all be thanking me. What kind of a topsy-turvy world do we live in, where-where heroes are cast as villains? Brave men as cowards?
Doing quite well, thank you. Yesterday I had a soft boiled egg and a quickie. You know what? If I could add TV to the equation, that would really be the ultimate.
I knew this was gonna happen some day. It was inevitable. I've known it ever since I was a little kid. I've been waiting for it.
Yeah, that's what I want-- triangles. Alright, I'm outta here. Have fun with what's-her-name.
Hey, Tim. Quick question. Is it normal for your teeth to make noises, like a hissing or a chirping?
(offers his) Oh, you want to taste mine.
You know, like all the comedians always say, 'How would you like it if I came to where you work and heckled you?'
(shaking hands with Morty) Morty, always a pleasure.
I mean, big would even be ok, a little beyond big.
Yes. Yes. You know what's interesting. The quarterback for the Atlanta Falcons is Bobby Hebert. No "r" which I find fascinating. You know it's Herbert h-e-r-b-e-r-t, Hebert h-e-b-e-r-t. "Hebert" it's a fun name to pronounce. Try and say it Hebert. Take a shot. All right. (check arrives) All right. I
Well you know, if you were sitting right next to her you'd have to console her no matter what.
Yes, it was purple, I liked it, I dont actually recall considering the buttons.
(grabs the phone quick) Got it, Got it,...Hello?
Like if she wants to know if I'm pleased with something, she'll say, "Happy, Pappy?"
One... (Glenda seeing George is serious; gets up and leaves)
I'll tell you something, I've never seen a pilot script as funny as this!
Whoa, whoa, you're not getting in my car with gummy shoes.
Hunh, You know, it's the damnedest thing. I went out the window again to, to get a cup of coffee...
Nah, nah, it's uh, it's a long story. Just uh, try to get it up.
Pssh. Would the protg pick up stuff for the mentor?
The government is very touchy about us being in the air. Let us run around on the ground as much as we want. Anything in the air is a big production.
You see that woman on the horse? (points)
You-you sure you never slept with her? (Jerry shakes his head 'no') Perfect.
Oh, this is my friend, Jerry Seinfeld. I just bumped into him around the corner. Isnt that a coincidence? The funny thing is, I see him all the time.
Oh, you lying little snot. And he's a cheater. Aren't ya' you little twerp?
(wondering) Maybe he doesn't. Maybe he and I are exactly the same, except for one minor, yet crucial, detail. You never know.
Of course you will. (quick chuckle). You're the best. (with a light fist motion across her chin)
I don't want Morgan's job. He's got a lot of work to do. Hey, Elaine, your friend never woke up Mr. Morgan.
Her back went out. She's gotta be there for a couple of days. All she said on the way over in the car was, "Why, George, why?!".. I said, "Because it's there!"
Parker, I never said driver, I said parker, a great parker.
They're selling coffee, bran muffins.. you're surrounded by reading material. It's entrapment!
So, she went out with you on a first date.. and it was her birthday?
Like what? I'm bald? What is it specifically? Is, is there an odor I'm not aware of?
Phil, I loved those cigars! Incoming! (Flicks his card tward Phil)
It's exciting, isn't it? She's gonna have a whole new face.
I know enough to stay away from it.
(playing with toys) Ahhhh, Yes! Touch down! Your turn, Jerry. (hands Jerry the Mattel Football. George starts playing with the Etch-a-sketch.)
...It was all a terrible misunderstanding, sir. Just five minutes. Just five minutes of your time. (listens) Thank you! Thank you, Mister Dalrimple.
(to himself) That's what I'd like to know.
You know I'm enjoying it very much. I think my coworkers are really taking to me.
We haven't heard his notes yet, we don't know how he feels about our work. (Russell throws up yet again.)
Thank you very much. (Peggy leaves the menus and walks away) So guess what I got do tomorrow?
There's gotta be more to life than this. What gives you pleasure?
Oy uy uy.. (Antonio points to the sink) We really should get going.
I hope so. I can't take him living with me much longer. He makes this kasha, it stinks up the whole house.
Of course you do... It's just, uh, y'know, I-I never *knew*, uh, that, uh...
Well then she's just a Liar, Isn't she?
All right You really want to know?...It all started when she told met hat...she was the voice on your tape recorder.
I think he was trying to tell me something, like it had some sort of a meaning.
[trying to act as if he doesn't care one way or the other, but we know better] Either way.
I, ... am breaking up with, ... you.
Ha, I don't know who she's looking for. I don't know. I'll tell you something. She's very particular, your daughter. Very particular. What is she looking for some big hot shot businessman? Well I've got my pride too. I'm not going to beg her.
So, they didn't give you a piece of cake? Big deal.
So I spoke a little to your little friend Denise last night.
(enthusiastic) And, you know, I do a lotta business with Japanese TV. They broadcast a lot of American baseball. They got an office here in New York!
In every situation. No matter how silly I look. (Tastes his Clams Casino) Hm.. tastes a little funky.
Its Martine. I think hes dying. He tried to kill himself with pills.
Got her machine. Im dead, Im a dead man. Thats it. Im dead, Im a dead man. Dead man.
All right, but we're not buyin' it at Bloomingdale's. I will buy it, you pay me back later. I'll sniff out a deal. I have a sixth sense.
What are you looking at me like that for?
Specific, Ah, lets see. I've walked in and out of so many buildings they all .. blend in together, I uh, ..
Oh no, I can't do it. I-I'm not good at these things, I get flustered. Once I tried to bribe an usher at the roller derby, I almost got arrested.
Deeply in love. If you can't say anything bad about a relationship, you shouldn't say anything at all.
Well, Danielle, (digs in his pocket) we should get going. I got a key made for you.
That's my whole afternoon! I was going to look for sneakers.
All right. Don't change me. Susan. Don't change me. Ya know there are a lot of woman that would love to be in your position right now.
Why should she like me? Who am I? Huh, there's a million people to like.
So I'm dressing and she's staring up at me, struggling to compute this unprecedented turn of events. I don't know what to say to reassure this woman, and worst of all, I don't have the time to say it. The only excuse she might possibly have accepted is if I told her I am in reality Batman, and I'm very sorry, I just saw the Bat-Signal. It took me 3 days of phone calls to get her to agree to see me again. Now she's waiting for me to call her, and she's
I believe strongly in that as you know.
She's been locked up for two years. She's gonna want to make up for lost time. Dinners. Movies. (Rubs his forehead.) Talking...
I got greedy. Flew too close to the sun on wings of pastrami.
Well she was sending out our wedding invitations.
No, no. Forget it. I don't want it. Let's just get rid of it.
(Sheepishly to Elaine) I'll be right back. (Leaves)
Where you going? I-I thought I could count on you for a little compassion.
Yeah. Thanks. Hey, listen, if you ever get a date, maybe the four of us could go out together sometime.
Shhhhh. If you want to get in, theres very little time. (calling to the waitress) Sweetheart.. (Waitress approaches and tears off a check. George stops her.) No, no, no. That ought to cover it. (He hands her some money; she turns to leave; George stops her.) Just a second. Just a... let me jus-peek... (He looks at the check, then takes some money out of her hand. George urges Jerry and Elaine to eat.) Come on, come on, come on...
Where are you meeting these women? When they get off the bus at the port authority?
Hello! All right, we should be going. Come on...
Let me tell you something. No one walks into a beauty parlor and says "Give me the Larry Fine."
Yeah, yeah. He went into the bedroom and started sobbing.
Does she care? No. Does anyone ever display the slightest sensitivity over the problems of a fellow individual? No. No. A resounding no!
Oh, no no no -- We bought the wine here before, but now, you know we're bl-blocked in by some car double parked and we're just waiting for the guy to pull out.
'My wife's in a coma.' Yeah? Well, the life support machine called and...
I havent seen it yet, but its a two-bedroom, its on the uh, west 83rd, bout a half block from the park?
You know I still don't know how you can call lunch with me a business expense.
. . . I'm a little scared of her.
Yes, yes, I definitely waited. But let me say this Once he passes on that option, that 'God bless you' is up for grabs.
So how do you want to do this?
Hey, Cosmo what happened to your mother last night. She hung me out to dry.
Would you stop it. (Susan playfully bites his ear lobe again) Would you quit it please. Someone is going to see us here.
Yup, y'know, they really spruce up the apartment.
I think I'd be good at that. I talk to people all the time. Someone even told me once they thought I'd be a good talk show host.
Dwayne, my friend and I would like to exchange frames. Could you put his lenses in my frames and mine in his?
Oh, come on! You gotta get me over there!
How come this sweater is only 85 dollars?
(Shocked) She's pregnant? Leslie is pregnant?! Oh, see, there is no justice.
(rising to his feet) Hey! Hey, you! (setting off after her) Come back here!! Don't gallop away!!
Yeah. (Points to two open seats in front of Jerry's. To Nina) Sit down there. (Sees Jerry in the crowd) Hello, Jerry. (Obviously angered at Jerry) I believe you know Nina.
Of course not. I mean sure, there may have been one or two occasions in the past, when I may have reacted in uh impulsive or somewhat immature manner, but those days are well behind me.
I'm not paying for this. If you were going out with her, it'd be a different story.
Hey, I am not a prude sweetheart. I swing with the best of them. (snapping his fingers 5 times)
I got it from the Institute. The Institute.
Tim, who's the head of the Aryan Union, you or me?
I mean it's gotten to the point where I'm flirting with operators on the phone. I almost made a date with one.
Yeah, tell im. But quickly, Im double parked here.
Hey, I've eaten frogs, so nobody's perfect. Anyway-
She doesn't Want to talk, she needs to talk.
Ma, will you stop?... Its just a statue!... How is it my fault?!... It was stolen. I didnt even touch it this time... Okay, fine... I dont see why this should affect to potatoes!... Okay... Goodbye. (George hangs up.) She doesnt react to disappointment very well. Unlike me.
(he makes a sign to Jodi to wait and turns to Jerry) Jerry... This woman hates me so much. I'm starting to like her.
Maybe this is what the pilot should be about, vomiting on somebody's vest.
Who says you gotta have a story? Remember when we were waiting for, for that table in that Chinese restaurant that time? That could be a TV show.
OK, ah.. (George throws his keys on the table) see ya!
Did I tell you I ran into her last week? Ho-ho, she looked great.
When are you going on your next date with her?
I heard the last guy got fired because his nose whislted.
So, I broke up with Maura. It's done. I'm out.
Oh...(is about to tell Jerry, but reconsiders) ...clothing, something, I dunno. So, uh, what are you doing today?
(laughing it off and trying too hard) Yeah, yeah. I have a thing for Marisa Tomei. Like she would ever go out with a short, stocky, bald man. (forced laughter) Hu hu, ha ha. Like that's her type. Huh. She's an Oscar winner. (nervous laughter) He heh. Besides, I don't even know her. It's not like anyone's trying to fix us up. Who, who would try and fix me up with Marisa Tomei?
Come on. Come on. Come on. Yeah. Yeah. (grunting)
You only think that because you know me.
I don't know. He said he wants to be my "key brother."
(to Jerry) Huh-ho! Have you ever seen anything like this?
S'cuse me ..Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?
He's coming up?! (Moves to the door) I'll check you out later.
No, no, he mimed it. That's what was so funny about it.
You want me to ask one of the Yankees.
That is what Mr. Steinbrenner wants. He wants, everyone, ta, twirl around.
Really? You like it? I got it at a flea market today.
(Reading) I see here that you play the harp.. tell me, why do you have to tilt it? Can't you just build it on an angle? It'd save you a lot of trouble.
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas! (Co-worker gives a gift to George) Oh, Sandy! Here is a little something for you.. (hands her a card)
That's the sign! The test; if a - if a man makes it move.
(Losing it) does not imply transfer of ownership. Moe, Sol, or Lem is not gonna get away with this!
(Nervous) Wh-what are you talking about? That - that's rediculous.
Only I hold the answer key to their true candy identities. And so, without further ado, I give you the candy line-up. (Opens a door to a back room. Various dealership employees are munching on candy bars)
Beautiful lineswoman. Alright listen uh I'm going to go to the concession stand and get some real sunblock. You want anything? Jerry? (Jerry is staring at the lineswoman) Jerry?
(smiling) Ho ho. Funny. Isn't he funny? Funny guy. Ha ha ha.
You didn't find it funny?! This is what I'm paying for?
You don't have to pay for the massage?
This was supposed to be 'The summer of George'! The summer of George.
Um, excuse me, I - I think you forgot my bread.
A-and don't settle for 145, you can do better, you're a genius. Heheheh (laughs)
I told them to meet me in front of my building at six-fifteen.
The sea was angry that day my friends like an old man trying to send back soup in a deli!
I keep wracking my brain to try and figure out what I did. I was smart, I was funny, I made great small talk with the waitress so she could see I could relate to the commoners, you know, I'm a man of the people.
Ah! Some bald thing, a bald thing I dunno. It's nothing
So, you were saying how, um...about the script...
Well... (shuts door) heeere we are (puts down his coat and chuckles)
Well what about all the Lloyd Braun sales?
I forgot to ask you; how did the revenge date go?
(ecstatic) What? You're moving to Florida!?! That's wonderful! I'm so happy! (pause) For you! I'm so happy for you! Oh, what do you need this cold weather for?
No. No it's not. You don't know this guy. It woulda been so sweet.
(from other room) Uh, tippy toe! Tippy toe! Lemon tree!
Well you didn't have to say it like that.
You had to hop! You had to hop on the plane.
(excited) Great news! I showed the pilot to Kramer's Japanese friends. They loved it!
Im not going with him. I dont even know the guy. (to the teller) Look, they did this for me before.
Pst. (moves in close with Elaine and Jerry) Wilkinsons got a bite on a new one. Petramco Corp. Out of, uh Springfield. I think. Theyre about to introduce some sort of a robot butcher.
This is a fantastic place! I always thought it was a meat packing plant!
Hey, I know what I'm talking about. I gotta be honest with you, I gotta tell ya... Ever since I saw you holding hands with that woman, I can't get you out of my mind.
yeah, Kramer, we're, uh, kind of in the middle of something here. We're trying to do a little work..
Well, I didn't want to break our date.
All right, let me ask you something When do you start to worry about ear hair?
I won fifty bucks! Boy, this is great. Too bad Elaine's not here.
I DON'T KNOW. It's this place. I'm very uncomfortable here.
(Looks fed up with his parents) Oh my God..
(to phone) Hi, Allison? Oh, I guess you're not at home.. I probably should 'ave tried you at the office. Anyway, good to hear from ya, really looking forward to the ball.. (hangs up and happily chuckles) Ha ha!
I was betrayed! That kid was like a son to me. And if there's one person you should be able to hold down, it's your own flesh and blood. Like my father.. my father's father before him.
I think I got it. How 'bout this? How 'bout this? We trade Jim Leyritz and Bernie Williams, for Barry Bonds, huh? Whadda ya think? That way I have Griffey and Bonds, in the same outfield! Now you got a team! Ha ha ha.
. All right , just give me my car and let me get the hell out of here.
Yeah!, a doodle of me...look at the size of the nose , the ears, all my features are distorted.
What, was that not politically correct? It's a legitimate question.
But, but I'm disturbed! I'm depressed! I'm inadequate! I got it all!!
Because Im not Latvian Orthodox. Her parents wont let her get involved with anyone who isnt Latvian Orthodox.
So she doesn't want to see me anymore.
(he drops a paper airplane he was holding) Mr. Wilhelm!
(Pointing to them) Office Christmas gift. I tell you, this Human Fund is a gold mine!
Why can't I have a heart attack? I'm allowed.
Aw right YES! GUM! Good enough I'll take it.
Oh yeah! Middle finger, straight up, at me! At us!
Theres no way I touch that bag for less than two dollars.
Oh, the busboy left the menu a little close to the candle.
Well I'm very excited about this. I've always wanted to see how those sketch artists do it.
Hi! Mr. West, this is my friend Elaine--
Whooo.. (To a waitress taking orders) Ooh.. French fries.
(Obviously knows that, but pretends he doesn't) What, tonight? Now?
Again with the checked out. I'm not going to the doctor. If I don't to the doctor, then nothing will happen to me. If I go he might find something.
We could build a cabin like (Snaps) that.
Well say were frightened and we have to go home.
(animated) You're letting him have a woman over?!
(to Kramer) It's a funeral procession. . . . (to Elaine) And I got news for you. I show up with Ring Dings and Pepsi, I become the biggest hit of the party. People be coming up to me, "just between you and me I'm really excited about the Ring Dings and the Pepsi. What are we, Europeans with the Beaujolais and Chardonnay . . .
Of course I mean that. I am incapable of guile.
Wait, wait a minute...they don't have them anymore. I just found out, they just took them off the market.
(knocking on the counter and feigning a muffled, Chinese voice) Chinese food!
So the plan is to secretly sterilise her mouth?
I don't think we should see each other any more.
You're not out there! You can't be, because *I* am out there. And if I see *you* out there, there's not enough voltage in this world to electroshock me back into coherence!
Is that the guy who likes fat women?
(animated) Fixed up? A cup of coffee! A cup of coffee is not a fix up!
Dont you think you get more without it?
(smug) Ah, I guess I showed Neil who's Neil.
All right. (tearing his jacket off) Let me just say one thing there is no way that this is gonna happen. You hear me? No Way! Because if you think I'm going' to two Thanksgivings, you're out of your mind!!!
The cabin.. (Laughs nervously) Well.. (Pauses as he thinks of a way to break the news, then decides to pass it off) Susan?
How do you know? What if pig-man had a two-seater?
She can't take it. It's not hers, it's theirs. Once there's no theirs there's no hers, it should be ours.
What are they doin' lettin' you bastards on an airplane? Don't they know that's against FAA regulation?
You disappoint me, my friend. Sandy wants nothing to do with you. She tells Laura, "If you want to waste your time with that pervert, that's your problem."
You might want to try it...makes the movie more enjoyable, that's all.
You are not gonna believe whats going on with this woman.
I gotta find a way to work this out, I love that apartment. It's so cozy, I'm ensconced in velvet. You know, if it were socially acceptable--
That's what nuns and Red Cross workers are for.
(Outraged. Leaving) Well, you just lost a lot of business! Because I love to read!
I really think I should have been consulted about this.
No wait, you can't just leave me here! Will I see you again?
Hey, you know, we haven't brought the Elaine character into the show yet. Umm, We should try and get her into this scene.
And I can make a left turn from the right lane too.
What do you know? You were in the nut house.
Well, Jerry, I been thinkin'. I've gotten as far as I can go with George Costanza.
Do you have something a little more... less expensive?
You're very good. Very good with the moanings and the gyrations. Y-You really had me going there for a minute.
Yeah, my cleaning lady's Portuguese. I must've picked it up.
Well I just got back from swimming in the pool. And the water was cold...
(Gestures for Kramer to shut up) Once again, Antonio, I can't even begin to say how deeply, deeply sorry I am about everything. The job, the cat.. (A lamp breaks) the lamp.
Were you just talking about me? What's going on?
(Letting his conscious get the best of him) I wonder how Susan's father's going to react to this. Alright, what- what's the worst he could do? So you burn a cabin down..
Well, OK. As I said the guy had it in for me. He actually failed me in gym. ... ME!
Kramer, what the hell are you talking about?
It's standard. Has she left you one of those messages where she uses up the whole machine?
All right, all right, one more time, one more time! What was the exact phrasing of the request?
(Annoyingly butting in) Kinda like Superman's fortress of solitude.
(Yelling out, frustrated. The camera spins from a top angle) Twwwwiiiiiixxxxx!
They were in here, I saw her put 'em in here!
Maybe she could like me? Is it that far fetched? Maybe she sees something? Is it possible?
I can't believe they actually found your stolen car.
She missed her period? Oh my god. I can't believe it! I'm a father! I did it! My boys can swim! I can do it! I can do it!
(chuckles) Bye, thanks. (To Jerry, when Susan is far) I can't believe she took the money.
Yeah.( reaches for the purse and finds a piece of paper . he looks annoyed.
Oh, very refreshing. (Thinking again) Sex is like joining a private club. I'll be the same me tomorrow, but suddenly, the no trespassing sign will be gone.
Well what if she calls me? What am I supposed to say?! (hand hits the table)
Jerry please, that's very nice, but, uh, (closes the door) where would we be going?
It's not working, Jerry. It's just not working. (sits down next to Elaine)
They're all the same. You go, you sit, you eat popcorn, you watch. I'm sick of it.
Sorry I'm late, but look what I found in the Yankee Hall of Pride display case.
The catering hall screwed up. The wedding is delayed until June. It's like a stay of execution.
Hey. Check these out. I just picked them up from Sheila. She must have loved these.
Why did France give that to us anyway?
I must have dripped some on the floor and I slipped and...
Right, I got news. You ready? (deep breath) Gary Fogel had cancer.
(Shrugging it off) She'll be fine. I gotta go to the hospital to see her tonight.
(Heavily sarcastic. He's angered at Jerry) Good one. Very funny. You're very funny, Jerry. That's what I always tell people. (Yelling out) Jerry Seinfeld's a funny guy!
I think hitting a defenseless child is my business.
Well I guess that's because I wear boxer shorts.
Yes they did. I was covering. Elaine has been deported back to Scotland.
You must be very proud Mr. Visaki. (shaking his hand) And may I say sir they're lovely girls, absolutely lovely girls. It's nice to see such fine upstanding women in gainful employment, Mr. Visaki.
(walking towards the door) I couldn't leave well enough alone?!
Hu, oh. No he thought I was hiding something from him about Morgan.
It's just a magnificent stone. (turns to Jerry) Jerry?
Say it's Saturday night in Spain. They go out dancing. You think they do the flamenco?
Its unbelievable. You know what else is unbelievable? I picked up the check. She didnt even offer. She ended it. The least she could do is send me off with a sandwich.
(To Jane) You know, when I was a kid, I once found a dollar and fifty cents in change on the bottom of the pool.
Or we don't even send the check and then when they call, we pretend we're the cleaning service. Heh heh. "Hello? I sorry, no here Kruger."
She dragged me down to that warehouse on the waterfront in Brooklin to see one of her "performances".
Ya, ya. I bumped into him on the bus. What did he have to say?
I love that bathroom. It's got that high, high toilet. I feel like a gargoyle perched on the ledge of a building.
Of course. Your massage. (winks) Enjoy your massage. (winks)
Who goes to the Super Bowl with their mailman?!
Sometimes it's good to have a pencil to write these things down.
(gets up to leave the table) HELLO!!! (angrily)
Yep. And it didn't take very long either.
So I said, "Mr. Hayman, It's me george Costanza, JFK, ... " He doesn't move. So I said uh, "Can't stand ya'", "Can't stand ya'" He turns and smiles, the little baked bean teeth. I get up to run away, but something was holding me back. It was Heyman. He had my underwear. There I was on the steps of the 42nd St. library , a grown man, getting a wedgie.
So you could call a woman for a date, ask her if she's free for Dinner and a flamenco?
Well, I didn't think anyone would play it.
Id like to have a kid. Of course, you have to have a date first... Remember my friend, Adam, from Detroit?
Yeah. (Jerry nodding) ... Oh, you think because of what I said about the manure. I wa, wa, was just saying how it takes a negative thing, and puts it on a positive spin on it.
(Looking at his finger) I think somethin bit me. I just need another nickel.
Ah, well, you know we gotta been running because of the ...
Dark and disturbed? His whole life revolves around Superman and cereal. I convinced him to act like that so that you would think I was funnier. That's how disturbed I am! If you want disturbed, that's disturbed. You can't find sickness like that anywhere, you think sickness like that grows on trees? Nobody is sicker than me, nobody. He's pretending, I'm the genuine article.
Excuse me. Am I talking to you, Pinhead? Am I?!
Oh. Okay, here it is, I got it. She lost her thumbs in a tractor accident and they grafted her big toes on. They do it every day.
Allright, I gotta head back right away, I'll-Ill -- I gotta figure something out here.
He's a jerk. (nudges to his right but no one is there)
You tellin' 'em about the butler story? Is that beautiful or what? Hey, sorry I'm late. (Looks at Rita) Russell?
I don't even know her sister but believe me, if she's getting traffic tickets, she's not that good-looking! Woah
Anyway there was all this tension. I asked her if she wanted to go out to dinner and she said "no, maybe we could get together for lunch." You know what that means.
(to Jerry) Have you seen the waitresses in there lately? I never had so much coffee in my life.
All right, stop it! Stay away from my breasts! Chest!
See, didn't bother Susan either. That's why I'm different. I can sense the slightest human suffering.
No, no, no, I dont want to carry it around all night. Ill pick it up later.
We're gonna hang around here a little while....something funny going on here
Know what? Ponce De Leon is sold out.
Behind the dugout, that's where we were sitting the other day.
Jerry took the flyers off the car, I got the whole thing covered.
Kramer was on Murphy Brown? That son of a gun!
(out the window) Keith, Keith, up here. Can you do me a favor? I need you to go to the unemployment office with me. I, I'm Jerry's friend  the guy from the locker room,  I'm the chucker. It'll take five minutes. Wait. Wait.
Up again?! This is incredible! Im.. Im getting it.
Oh yes, by no means, the mood. Let me know if there's anything I can do to lend support to the mood.
Hey I get a free trip to Paris, I go in the Big Brother's Hall-of-Fame, I mail my own postcards.
Wha-Is that the one your parents gave you?
I can't take it anymore! I'm going to work! ARe you happy now?! (Gathers his things, and runs out of the coffee shop. Elaine and Jerry laugh hysterically)
Eh, but, you know, Mr. Ross, if - if you look at the whole situating, what with it being your cigars, and everything, it's really rather ironic - one might even say, in a sense, comical.. (Mr. Ross has, by now, left the room. Mrs. Ross is pointing at George, nodding, laughing. As if to say he hit the bullseye. George calls out to Mr. Ross) Really. Think about it.
I know. That's the point. If it's gonna get sexual, it should get sexual with you.
(Mocking, skeptic) Yeah, you show us the 900.
I'd like to be able to get it out.
yeah that's right. I like it. He's such a cool guy
(singing) Lemon tree, very pretty and a lemon flower...
Yeah, Jimmy why don't you wait outside, you know, play with something.
You have my spare-key in your apartment, right?
(Even more nervous than before) Oh, the, uh, the cabin.. well, (Clears throat)
(Pleading) You gotta let me go over there.
Sometimes in life, the gods smile upon you, my friends.
I get the feeling when lesbians are looking at me, they're thinking "That's why I'm not heterosexual".
(knocks) You hem... wanted to see me Mr. Steinbrenner?"
I know. This was like a record. My previous record was when Joni Hirsch asked me not to tell anybody that we slept together. Kept a lid on that for about 28 seconds.
Yeah, that's exactly what I'm worried about. God would never let me be successful. He'd kill me first. He'd never let me be happy.
I know less about women than anyone in the world. But one thing I do know is they're not happy if you don't spend the night. It could be a hot, sweaty room with no air conditioning and all they have is a little army cot this wide (Displays with French fry) You're not going anywhere.
Yeah. The thing is, I, uh...I had this little zinger of my own I wanted to try.
(entering Jerry's bathroom) Well, Hanke's moved on to Step Ten. He was spotted taking personal inventory.
you better be careful on those rocks tomorrow buddy. And you're not getting any sandwiches either
The perfect combination of Mountain Dew and mozzarella...just the right amount of grease on the joy stick...
(ignoring Jerry) I mean I'm not really working right now.
Ripe. Boy, this Joe's got some terrific fruit.
I gave her a twenty, she only gave me change for a ten.
Morning Thunder has caffeine in it, Jerry doesn't drink caffeine.
"There's a lot of money in this.. He's got a proven sales method"
Look at me! I am man! I am you!
Oh my God, I forgot to tell you. I got a letter today from the State Controller's Office. Y'know when I was going to public school back in Brooklyn, every week I used to put fifty cents in the Lincoln Savings Bank.
(On his way out) Heh, heh, heh. Thats what they want you to think.
It took a couple of hours of convincing. I was persistent. I was just like those guys in the movies. And it worked! She said "Yes"! I can't believe my luck that she was still available . A beautiful woman like that. You think she's good looking, right?
Wow, Keith Hernandez. He's such a great player.
You are a good friend. You know what? Even if you killed somebody I wouldn't turn you in.
Where are you gettin' a Wizard for fifty dollars?
Yeah.. yeah, we're - we're cool. (Knocks lightly. Kramer takes charge by knocking on the door louder. The busboy answers) Uh, I'm sorry to bother you, I was in the restaurant earlier and I was wondering if I could talk to you for a few minutes about what happened. (He gestures for them to come in. They obey) I hope I'm not interrupting anything. It's just that I think I may have - without realizing it - been responsible for getting you fired. (Nervously laughs) And.. and.. and I just want you to know that I didn't intend for that to happen.
Well, I'm not buying it. No way. Forget it. No way I'm buying this! (beat) I mean, look at it! What is it? It's a bunch of squiggly lines! (beat) Are you telling me you couldn't paint this?
Mr. Morgan! Did you hear that? Mr. Morgan!
You paying my hotel and airfare to Miami?
Severance package...The Yankees are giving me three months full pay for doing nothing.
Can I say one thing to you? And I say this with an unblemished record of staunch heterosexuality.
Your friend is been accused of being a serial killer. I think that qualifies.
You want me to roll six thousand of these?! What, should I quit my job?!
Well, Play Now has all kinds of different rubber balls. Why dont we test your bladder system at my office?
(seeing Elaine and Puddy come into Monk's) Yeah. Hey, Lainie, Puddy.
She had this throaty , sexy kind of whisper.
Well does it say anywhere in the contract about my car being used as a whorehouse? 'Cause I don't remember reading that clause either..
Why don't you just get some Ring Dings from the liquor store?
They would never tell me, Elaine. First of all, they probably think that I killed Susan. Besides, I don't even think they like me. (Jerry comes over to the table.)
"Breakfast At Tiffany's." 90 pages. (Waves a hand like it's nothing.)
But Kramer, isn't it a question of hygiene?
Jay Crespi, how am I gonna forget Jay Crespi?
So, what's in the cooler? (flips open the lid)
(shouts) Wait! Yes! That's what I should've said! (frustration) D'ohh!
But I have to have them by one o'clock. He's very regiment about his meals.
He asked me to keep it a secret.
Wish I could. (raises the magazine up in front of his face and continues reading.)
Yeah, yeah. Well, I guess I started losing it when I was about twenty-eight right around the time I made my first million. You know what they say. The first million is the hardest one.
I can't go out there, he knows we're friends.
Jerry Seinfeld. My best friend. He can explain all of this. (calls to Jerry) Jerry.
All right. All right. Let's - let's go over that again.
I'd like to say it once to someone that can actually hear it!
(Losing it) I guess everyone here enjoys giving the old screwgie, huh?! Youre all doin a hell of a job! (Looks longingly at the Twix in the machine) Ho, ho. What I would do with you..
I think he's saying 'Son of Sam'! Oh, my God!
All I want is my seventy-five cents back, an apology, and for him to be fired!
Well it's not my fault. Seinfeld can't drive. How hard is it to follow somebody?
The wedding is off. Now you can go to the Super Bowl.
So how long has it been in the basement?
I really don't think we're supposed to be talkin' about this.
What are you doing? Where do you think you're going?
I mean we can put a man on the moon but we're still basically very stupid. The guy who's car this is? He could be one of the guys that built the rocket. You see what I'm saying?
What is that? Its ridiculous! You dont even know what hotel shes staying at, you cant call her. Thats a signal, Jerry, thats a signal! (snaps his fingers) Signal!
Did you see that? The guy's walking away. What is wrong with you? That was a three hundred dollar profit.
What? Huh, so I had it all along. How d'you like that? (snorts) I guess I owe that cashier an apology.
That's right. He just happened to be the previous owner of the vehicle.
My parents don't read! They're gonna wonder what a book is doing on the table!
It's just paper on a roll, that's it. And that's all it will ever be.
Unless she goes for the bathroom. Thats my only chance. (George crumbles. He drops the cassette on the table.) Who am I kidding? I cant do this, I cant do this. I dont even know how to work those stupid machines.
Marisa Tomei! I, just spoke to Marisa Tomei! (sitting opposite Elaine) And I wasn't even that nervous.
Well, you never know. (picks up more shrimp) Let's see how many I can fit in my mouth.
Im keeping it. Im going down with the ship.
He said that? (Daphne shacks her head) What a nerve. How dare he say something like that.
This is our new Vice-president of Acquisitions, sir.
You know, we're living in a society! We're supposed to act in a civilized way.
What, you don't want me to hold your keys?
I've been standing here for the last ten minutes!
That's it? You don't have to screw it in or anything?
(Interrupting) Anyway, I just wanted to let you know I'm really sorry that happened, and if I can help out in any way, I'll certainly be glad to do that. (Pause) Well, I guess that's about it.
And I have to go. If I don't go, he'll know I'm lying.
The network executive. You think she liked me?
Maybe it's not even stupidity. Maybe it's just a blatant disregard for basic human decency. Yeah this how dictator's start. Do you think Mussolini would circle the block six times looking for a spot?
Isn't polite to say Hello when somebody says hello?
(Asking Elaine) Jerry seem a little weird when I mentioned Nina?
Give me the phone. (dials) Yea, Hi I would like to speak to Patrice. ... what? ... oh really? ... oh, ok, thank you, ... (hangs up)
(dismayed) I didn't even know you wanted to get serious!
(To Estelle) Scissor. (She gets the scissors from the coffee table and hands them to George with the point facing him) Don't hand them to me with the point facing out!
Yes! Yes. You know. She didn't know about Pasteurization. He didn't know anout Fumigation. But they made it work!
Well if she can't tell "six" from "sex" then how is she going to lip read from across the room?
I'll get him to see a real doctor. You just stay away from this.
(looking over her resume) Well Miss Coggins you're ah, obviously qualified for the job. You've all the necessary skills and experience. But you're extremely attractive. you're gorgeous. Im looking at you, I can't even remember my name. So ah, Im afraid this is not going to work out (he crumples her resume into a ball) Thanks for coming in.
No... (takes off his glasses and wipes his eyes with his sleeve)
My dad was a cook during the Korean War. Something very bad happened, ever since you can't get him near a kitchen.
Because important things go in a case. You got a skull for your brain, a plastic sleeve for your comb, and a wallet for your money.
Eh, listen Mr. Kruger, I got a message from Dr. Van Nostrand and he says it might be wise to you to see another doctor about that mole.
(grabbing the sweater back) Well it's not really damaged. 85 dollars huh?
(Yelling out to a waitress) Gonna need some water here!
She's confiding in him about our dates. You always like the person you talk to about the date more than the date! It's just a matter of time till they realize, 'Hey, we could have sex.'
I would give anything to be going up those stairs again.
Um, I don't uh, really think I can go.
No you wouldn't. Nobody would. It's just that... they were missing, and... well I'm just inquiring. (chuckles nervously)
I should probably get going too. If I don't feed Pequita by seven, she goes all over everything.. take it easy.
It's a spanish dish. It's a moulage of fish, an meat with rice. Very tasty.
Elaine, I'm, I'm shocked. I'm shocked. Here I go out in the spirit of the season (Elaine looking like she's not buying a word of it) and spend all my savings to buy you the most beautiful Christmas sweater I have ever seen to show my appreciation to you at Christmas and this is the thanks that I get at Christmas.
Hey, Elaine. Maybe his girlfriend is Lois Loan.
In the whole world right now, there's maybe three emergencies. Why would you think, on this entire planet, that you're one of those three?
I bet they have more money than mine.
You know, Louise. I think you'll find this amusing. In early Euclidean geometry--
Yes, now. It's gonna take a few days and my parents are gonna be back. I gotta have it back before them!
You see (to Jerry). You see. You see what Im talking about. It's all just slipping away. And you're letting it happen. (exits -- slamming the door)
La-la Land. I got the window seat, right?
I know, I hate it too. I feel like an out of work porn star.
Nah, he didn't have anything to do with it...
(at dinner with his cousin) Some more merlot?
This is totally different! That was my secret, this is Jerry's secret! There's...there's attorney-client priveleges here! If I play it by your rule, no one'll ever confide in me again, I'll be cut out of the loop!
Did you here that? I can't believe this he's eating his sandwich.
How would you like a 'Hare Krishna' fist on your throat, you little punk?
Okay, go ahead. Call her, get married, have babies, have a great life.. What do I care? I'm finished. (Really depressed) It's all over for me. In fact, let's end it right now. Jerry, kill me, kill me now. I'm begging you. Let's just get it over with. Be a pal.. Just take the pillow and put it over my face.
But enough about fish, huhuhu. I can discuss other things you know, ah architecture. Huhu. (makes a wide gesture with his arms)
. . . I thought the woman was kind of cute.
That's not funny. So, are you coming to the party?
And, it is all because of that car
When Lupe makes up the beds in the morning.
I think they really went for that Soda.
Oh my God, an affair. That's so adult. It's like with stockings and martinis, and William Holden. On the other hand it probably wouldn't cost me any money.
She supports her whole family. (walking slowly into the room)
How can you compare you parents to my parents?!
You know a lost and found could be a good idea.
You know, Einstein wore the exact same outfit every day.
He's the guy we're the buying the chair for, remember? It was your suggestion.
Oh, uh, the cigars.. (Chuckles nervously) I'm, uh, suckin' 'em down. I'm puffing my brains out, yeah.
Well, then, I am gonna have to ask you to turn your key.
Someone's have to unhook the boat before it leaves...the place!
Alright, I gotta go. I'm heading over to Bonnie's.
(Standing in the doorway) I'm fine with it! Fi-hi-hi-hine I say! (Leaves)
We should have left earlier. I told you.
I know. Don't you see. (emphatic) He was doing it to fool Lloyd Braun!
Jerry! I did it! Haha! I beat Braun!
(afraid not) No no, no no no. You're not goin' in there.
Yes and I was hoping ... to get a thirteen week extension.
(Praising Leo's stealing) Alright, Leo! Stickin' it to the man!
Well, I am just a T-bone kinda guy. Love that T-bone. In fact, you might as well call me--
Oh leave Jack alone. Jack's got enough problems. I'll just take the small office.
I can't believe you're really going out with a woman named Lois.
(George, finger in the peanut butter jar) This is what I do.
Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute, don't tell me, don't tell me. It starts with a . . . Duncan Meyers. Oh, wow, this is something. I haven't seen you guys in what, twenty years?
Listen I was talking to Elaine today and she said she'd would really like to be an usher at the wedding
(Sitting on the sofa) I'm on no sleep, bro.
(To Carl) Oh, by the way, order anything you want, it's all on me. Just do me a tiny favor pretend we're old friends. Oh my God! Mr. Morgan! What a coincidence, it's Mr. Morgan. Mr. Morgan, I want you to meet a dear old friend of mine, Carl.
Come on, hurry up, old man! I'm an animal!
Yes. Yes. Care. You know who I think about a lot? Remember SUSAN ? The one that used to work for NBC?
(talking on the phone) Jerry you gotta bring me some clothes down here. I lost my job with the Yankees. I'm standing in the men's room on 43rd street in my underpants.
Well, they gave birth to me, and, yada yada...
Did I get him in trouble? Because of what I said?! I just told him what happened.. he didn't do it on purpose.. (Mangager and busboy are arguing. The busboy points in the direction of George) He pointed at me. Why did he point at me?!
(agitated) Alright, I gotta try and talk my mother into taking him off my hands.
What, are you kidding? (Points at the flaws of Jerry's hands) The knuckles are all out of proportion. you got hair over there - where do you get off comparing your hands to my hands?! This is a one-in-a-million hand. (Points to his own hand)
U-ok. (George closes the window and shoos Elaine off. He opens the door to Monica.) Here you go.
And who's responsible for making hate mongering and fascism popular again?
Students cant clean. Its anathema. (explaining) They dont like it.
How hard could it be? You make a little contribution, you have a ceremony. I am going to think about this. I am really going to think about this.
Ho ho ho ho! I can't wait for Hanke to come crawling back to me.
You know what, bad mistake my mistake do me a favor go back to the other lane - you'll never get there - forget this lane - y'a kn ow what this lane stinks - go back to the other lane - bad decision - go go go take this light - take this light -
Yes, well, I sat down with Mr. Steinbrenner. I told him you have been doing great work. I said that you deserved a raise, and if you didnt get it, that I, was leaving. (motions with both arms in a circular motion to his right)
You see, this is what I do with women. I start out too strong, now I have to become real, that's when it all falls apart. What good is real? They don't want real, they want funny.
I'm telling you, that cashier is riding horses on my money.
Because I uh, I told her the truth.
Wait a minute, call the car phone, see what happens.
Uh why don't you wait then go in the movies?
Well, Jerry. There was a pretty good chance I was never gonna have sex again anyway.
I tell ya, I am hooked on these books on tape.
(ahem) In this age of uncertainty and confusion, a man begins to ask himself certain questions. How can one even begin to put into words something so um (trying to think of a word)
It's like puberty that never stops. Ear puberty, nose puberty, knuckle puberty, you gotta be vigilent. Let me ask you this Do you know where Walker Street is downtown? I've got a league meeting there.
Oh - comfort, schmomfort. Listen, Father, can I ask you a question? In a terrible time like this...who would I get the death certificate from?
Y'know what it is? It's "Clara Nightingale Syndrome." He falls ill; she falls in love.
A drafty apartment? A... sweaterless friend? A ball-game giveaway Metlife windbreaker?
I got a big problem here, Jerry. The tapes are worthless.
Boy! What a story! I'm speechless. Speechless. I have no speech.
(slightly worried) You know, I'm starting to get a little nervous about this lunch.
Uh, excuse me. (stopping them from rehearsing) Excuse me. (he walks to the guy's in charge of yelling "take #!") This--This is not right. May I? (the guy looks at George with a bothered face. George then walks up to Tom and takes him away from Jerry and Michael to talk to him in private)(to Tom) You see, you're going "They fooled *me* Jerry!" (George shakes his head with disapproval) You wanna hit 'fooled' more "They *fooled* me Jerry!". You see the difference?
Oh my God. I just remembered where I left my retainer in second grade. I'll see ya. (He throws finished Rubik's cube to Jerry and he exits. Kramer enters)
Eh...come oooon...(starts stabbing the paper with the pen. Mr. Wilhelm comes in)
I can't. I gotta make the weekly call to the folks.
Oh, so now I have to buy this whole chair by myself?
(TALKING IN PASSENGER WINDOW) I didn't mean anything by it. I don't even know L. Ron Hubbard! I didn't know you were...
Hi, it's me. It's Georgie Boy. What's going on?
Well I can't now, Gwen's going to be there.
Jerry, what do you, you wanna, you wanna see the place or not?
How do you know it was her dude?
Yes he is. Let me ask you something. When you come out of the shower and you put your robe on, do you cinch it real tight, are you concerned about that?
I hurt it in a hotel room. You know where they tuck the covers in real tight in those hotel rooms? I can't sleep like that so I tried to kick it out and I pulled it.
How are we gonna get out of here? They'll kill us!
But I asked you before if you had a ticket, and you said no!
Well, anything I can do to help, um...she's a wonderful girl. Very smart. Very eh...crafty.
Yeah, yeah. Just delivering some presents to my folks.
No, I'm gonna hold it under her nose so she can smell the scent of stale Bosco that I had to live with for three years, and I'm gonna say, "Remember this shirt, baby?! Well, now, it's payback time!"
(worried) Yeah, that's right. What if it's a genetic thing, like father like son?
Oh hey, by the way. Do you want a box 'a, Cuban cigars? I smoked one last night. I got nauseous.
I got rejected by a bald woman. A bald woman rejected me. Heh, you like that one? A woman with no prospects and no *hair*, told me that I wasn't her type. Apparently *baldy* likes a slimmer guy.
The nickname. George. What is that? It's nothing. It's got no snap, no zip. I need a nickname that makes people light up.
(clears his throat) Im, uh, Im an architect.
Well who schedules his wedding on Super Bowl Sunday?
No-no-no, we all chipped in. We have the money.
I thought you said he was gonna get a muffin.
Hey believe me, baldness will catch on. When the aliens come, who do you think they're gonna relate to? Who do you think is going to be the first ones getting a tour of the ship?
She told me she wants-- (Pauses until a woman coming down the stairs passes) She told me she wants me to make love to her.
Twelve dollars? I knew we should have gone to the bakery. I guarantee you theyre not getting no twelve dollar cake.
I dont know what the hell I said. I gave her an ultimatum and theres nothing I can do. Its a machine. The little light is blinking right now, Come and listen to the idiot. Hey everybody, the idiots on!
You're not goin to do it? What do you mean, You're not goin to do it?
Miss Rhode Island? When are you seeing her?
It's a pot pourri. May I, uh, may I show you the master bedroom? (they leave together)
(Relieved) I haven't? I'm okay? I'm okay? Oh, thank you, thank you, Doctor! I don't know how to thank you.
Wait a minute? He's picking up the van tonight? This is perfect. I'll drive Rhisa to someplace romantic. Then when my father slides the door open, I'm in the van kissing his brother's daughter.
(quiet, desperate) Maybe she can get me another picture of man-hands. (calling) Elaine!
You shook my hand in that coffee shop.
Uh, yes, uh...you don't know me, my name is George Costanza...did you happen to rent Breakfast At Tiffany's?
Hey, you know what else is playing here? ``Rochelle Rochelle''.
Just one? I'm living like twenty. (chuckles) What's yours?
Channel eleven? Forgive me for trying to class up this place, for trying to have the Yankees reach another strata of society that might not watch channel eleven.
I'm sorry, umm he-here's your money back (gives Rudy the money back) I-I-I'll have the clothes.
My presence, in that office, can only hurt my chances.
A cup of coffee. That, that doesn't mean anything.
You know what you should do? You should tell this guy you're seeing somebody else. That's the easiest way to get out of these things.
But she's gonna know that I like her more than she likes me.
Aah! the minute I saw this girl, we just clicked. She's got such a nice face. hummmm her eyes, her mouth, nose
I don't see how I could perform sexually in a situation after something like that. I was completely emasculated. Anyway, it's not the only reason.
(Trying to keep his voice down) I think you've done a lot more than talk! You betrayed me!
Why? Maybe she liked me. I, I mean she was looking right at me. You know, I think she was impressed. You know, we had good eye contact the whole meeting.
Oh good, good, come in. Come in, welcome. I'm George. And this is Jerry, over there, on the phone, that's Jerry. And you are, um?
I cant call her now. Its too soon. Im planning a Wednesday call.
I dont know, what? Eight thousand. Its a Hyundai. Get out of here. I told you not to sell. Simons made money, Wilkinson cleaned up.
I don't think I could do it. You know, they always remember the first time. I don't want to be remembered. I wanna be forgotten.
(entering the apartment more fully) Oh. Oh, hi, hi. Hi. Nice to meet you. (peering at the table) What're you having, veal?
Jerry! I need you to get another picture of man-hands. I'm beggin' you!
Ava was one of the reasons I used to like going to work, she was a friend. Now we sleep together and suddenly, I don't know how to talk to her. Every time I go to the bathroom I pass her desk. I have to plan little patter. I spend half my day writing. Then afterwards, I sit in my office and analyze how it went. If it was a good conversation, I don't go to the bathroom for the rest of the day. I see her laughing and talking with other people, they're all so loose and relaxed, I think, 'that used to be me. I want to go back there again.'
Oh yeah yeah, don't you know they used pastrami in that movie 9? weeks? Remember the pastrami scene?
I got to give the players most of the credit for that.
Look at this. There's no spaces here. (to another car) Excuse me, are you gettin' out?
(Eating a sandwich) Oh, like you really know busboys.
My face! My face! Get me to the hospital!
(with a mouth full of food) This is good. Oh, this is good.
I really can not comprehend how stupid people could be sometimes. Can you comprehend it?
(holding a magazine cover) Mira Sorvino. Think she'd go out with me?
(singing) Oh hey, if you happen to see the most beautiful girl who walked out on me. Tell her I'm sorry. Tell her I need my baby ... oh won't you tell her ... I love her. Oh hey, ...
Oh my god he's not kidding. (exhale gasp)
Well, I think Poppie's got some problems. There's a whole other thing going on with Poppie. So how did you leave it?
Because he made a big deal about how I understand everything immediately. That's what impressed him.
I don't like when a woman says, 'Make love to me', it's intimidating. The last time a woman said that to me, I wound up apologizing to her.
I'm the opposite of every guy you've ever met.
Exactly! You know how they get animals to reproduce in captivity? They just put them in the same cage.
So, they go off for the ride, by the time they come back the bread is there.
"Well...there's no room for someone like that in this organization."
All right. So, you hold out your money, speak your soup in a loud, clear voice, step to the left and receive.
(sensing his chance) Well, they do now. Neighborhood's changing.
All Simons was able to find out is that hes in the hospital.
What do you mean, I got? You didn't give him his Visa application.
So I tell Alec that I have to go to Paris for an undetermined amount of time. Then all I have to do is buy some post cards and have your parents mail them from Paris.
Awright, lemme just say this. Ten thousand dollars, alright, and now I'm going below what you wanted to pay. You have your dinner, have your veal, or whatever it is. Enjoy...
The plane's been re-routed *back* to Kennedy. We've got 45 minutes.
(to Jerry) How could we not hear anything? What's with this Russel? What's he doing? (Jerry raises his arms and shoulders like he doesn't know)
What's to think about? If Putty says it's what it is, it's what it is. He's not gonna cheat you.
All right, I gotta make a call. Everybody out, come on.
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, go. Go about your business, I'll just wander around.
Oh, yeah. I read what you said to the papers yesterday. You weren't in on the planing. What planning? YOU THINK WE PLANED THIS? Uh?
Oh, no no no. I pay what I say.
(checking his watch) Hey, let's get the check, she's taking the bandages off at four o'clock.
Well what did you want her to do, you left it on the night table.
(Hands still out, even though they've stopped looking at them) What happened to him?
Jerry! Oh, my God! What are you doing!?!
"These pretzels are making me thirsty"? That was one line! You got fired!
Divorce is very difficult. Especially on a kid.
You know, I have to tell you something. You couldn't get me on a plane right now. I get those FAA reports directly. My uncle sends them to me, he used to be a pilot, so. Big investigation in the, uh, what's the word there, uh, offing. It's in the offing. But, you know, you shouldn't let that stop you from going. You could go. I don't mind.
No, Ill put half a can of mousse in my head like you.
Your boyfriend reads the Daily Worker? What is he? A communist?
(to a street vender selling hot dogs) You must hate hot dogs, huh? Or else, you, uh, you really like 'em and that's why you, you do this.
All right, we'll be a little late, I,m not taking a cab.
[quite out loud, not even pretending to whisper] Elaine!
If only something like that could happen to me.
Yes, sure, surely was. Yeah, I'll remember that day. Well I'll never forget it because that was the day that I uh, lost my virginity to Miss. Stafford, the uh, voluptuous home room teacher.
Yeah! Look at me! I was free and clear! I was living the dream! I was stripped to the waist, eating a block of cheese the size of a car battery!
What do you mean Wednesday? I though we had tickets to the Knick game Wednesday. We got seats behind the bench! What happened? Were not going?
Well, I wanna talk to him about this.
Huh, he's a communist. . . . Look at this. "Exciting uninhibited woman seeks forward thinking comrade and appearance not important." . . . Appearance Not Important! This is unbelievable. Finally this is an ideology I can embrace.
I saw Amy making out with your cousin Jeffrey.
(Sarcastic) Yeah, yeah. I'm gonna move in with him. He doesn't even let you use the toilet!
You ask me here to have lunch, tell me you slept with Elaine, and then say you're not in the mood for details. Now you listen to me. I want details and I want them right now. I don't have a job, I have no place to go. You're not in the mood? Well you get in the mood!
Very exciting, very exciting, it's like watching a birth.
(pause) Alright if you think it's too much they don't have to mail the postcards.
Oh, well th-that's great. It's really great. Hm hm mm.
Yeah, and she's going to find I'm a moron. You know, people think I'm smart, but I'm not smart.
Yes, well, you know, Im not thinking about the price. You know youre the only woman Ive never thought about the price. Get the lobster. I beg you to get the lobster. Go for the lobster.
Well, it's just, all you said was 'your welcome', which is nice. It's very nice. But... I feel I gotta get the apology.
Unbelievable, I'm never gonna get out of here. The guy goes to pee, he never comes back. It's like a science fiction story.
No, I decided to go with an '89 LeBaron.
She's right, I heard Kramer got mugged out on the suburbs on a baby-sitting gig.
Aren't those the guys that always go crazy and come back with a gun and shoot everybody?
(frantic) Oh, Jerry Jerry Jerry Jerry Jerry, listen, if, if you are feeling uncomfortable about this at all, at all. Do not feel like you have to take it.
Would you believe my luck? The first time in my life I have a good answer to the question, "What do you do?" and I have a girlfriend. I mean, you don't need a girlfriend when you can answer that question. That's what you say in order to get girlfriends. Once you can get a girlfriend, you don't want a girlfriend, you just want more girlfriends.
Listen, I gotta ask you I was a little concerned that perhaps I was responsible in some way for your, uh... metamorphosis.
No, and you weren't funny last night either. In fact, you got us both so depressed, she asked me to drive her home after dinner.
What do I do? Well actually, I'm a writer. In fact, I'm writing a comedy pilot for NBC right now.
I got it. You wanna get her something nice? How 'bout a music box?
Well, you could move in with my parents. (chuckles)
How about the old Spider Man live action show?
Ah, shut up, Jerry. My parents think they can ignore me. Heh heh. Well, they better think again.
(excited) Did I tell you that story's relatable?! That was a great show! That is why I'm bringing it back to NBC.
No. I am not giving my code to anyone for any reason.
(gets up and picks a mirror) Yes. Yes, it's white. Why it's white.
You know, suddenly I'm in the mood for pasta primavera myself. (Jerry nudges George to sneak a peek at Molly's cleavage as she bends over and looks in her backpack. Jerry has a quick look, but George stares, hypnotized. Russell comes up behind George.)
Those birthdays. I told you. They're relationship killers. If a relationship is having any problems whatsoever, a birthday will always bring it out.
Fitted Hat Day! That's what you asked Steinbrenner for?
I was handcuffed to the bed.. In my underwear, (Sighs) where I remained.. (Scene cuts to another story) She was attractive.. She was, also, infact, a Nazi.. (Cuts to another story) The water.. that I had been swiming in was.. very cold. And, when I dropped the towel, there was.. significant shrinkage.. (Scene cuts to, yet, another story) Her parents were looking at me.. So, there I was, with a marble rye hanging from the end of a fishing pole.. (Scene cuts to his closing statements) In closing, these stories have not been embellished, because - they need no embellishment. They are simply, horrifyingly, the story of my life as a short, stocky, slow witted bald man. (Gets up) Thank you. (Every memeber of the board shows some sign that George's story is most deserving of the apartment. Ricardi is crying. George turns to leave, then remembers one more thing..) Oh, also.. my fiance died from licking toxic envelopes that I picked out. (Sobs and loud crying erupts from the board members) Thanks again. (Leaves. Eldridge looks defeated)
Yes, yes. Very smooth, super smooth. No, but I really wanna attack this thing, you know. Sink my teeth into it. So I was just wondering... what do you think would be the very best way to get started?
Come on, how hard is that? Look at all the junk that's on TV. You want an idea? Here's an idea. You coach gymnastics team in high school. And you're married. And your son's not interested in gymnastics and you're pushing him into gymnastics.
Ah, great, great. (sniffs) What's that smell? Smoke? (walks to the kitchen) Hey everybody, I think I smell some smoke back here...(smoke boils into the doorway.) FIRE! FIRE! Get out of the way!
Aw, that's a fun age. (Jerry looks at George distastefully.)
(Rubbing his stomach) Ooh.. Something's not sitting right..
Jerry, let me tell you something, "A man without hand is not a man." I got so much hand I'm coming out of my gloves. I got to thank Kramer.
You know what? I think this Ruthie Cohen gave me the wrong change. Didn't I pay with a twenty? I'm sure I paid with a twenty.
(annoyed) Not a peep. They just cleaned the carpets and left. Call themselves a cult!
Yeah. A couple of people. I don't get that, though. Where do you start?
I still don't see why I can't ask her about my arm.
Because of me? You must be joking! Who wouldn't want to live because of me? I'm nothing!
Tell you what, I'll make a deal with you. I'll sell it to you right now for ten bucks.
Wow! Heh. (Half kidding) You don't, huh, have a replacement lined up for me, do ya? heh he he he he he...
And then, (Smacks the money) there were two.
You know what this means? I can't see her anymore either.
It's a little unusual. So, uh, Susan and I were thinking, uh, dinner at our house Saturday night. Just the four of us.
Play Now thinks I got problems in both legs. My own personal Rascal, Jerry. On the house.
Alright, lets get in there. Quick, quick, quick...
Not everybody knows what the crop circles are. (to the newsstand owner) Do you know what the crop circles are?
(scoffs) Those unions. (sighs) Okay. Sports,...movies. What about a talk show host?
It's not my fault! I wasn't going to do anything until you got her all juiced up with your story about having the affair with the matador!
Mr. Pensky. I was just working on your file. I was transferring the contents of the file into this flexible accordion-style folder.
Now she thinks we're gay, not that there's anything wrong with it...
She had to be impressed by that conversation, had to! It was a great performance. I am unbelievable on the phone. On the date they should just have two phones on the table at the restaurant, done.
I can't do this! I can't do it. I have tried. I'm here. It's impossible.
Now I remember, as I jumped over the hole I heard a, like a jingling sound.
I was not winking you idiot. That was the grapefruit. It's like acid. I need that card back. It's Mr. Steinbrenner's. I was responsible.
Jiffy Park. It's incredible.. Seventy-five dollars a month.
So he... had his hands and, uh, he was uh
I dont know why you even bother with this ping pong guy, Ill tell you that.
Yesterday, took the day off. (Picks up a red Power Ranger action figure from the model and pretends it's him.) Now, from the time I left the room...
You know, if it was a regular salad I wouldn't have said anything. But you had to have the BIG SALAD.
I'll fight ya! Not the face! Not the face! (The struggle continues.)
Elaine, Elaine, Elaine, Elaine...(distant alarm sound which is getting louder.)
See, this should be a show. This is the show.
I mean, she's beautiful, right? She's just my type. The dark hair, the full lips.
Yeah, I'll zip in, "How do you do?", zip out. She'll love me.
Dad, that other car cut us off! They had swastikas all over it... They were hurling racial epiphates at us... I could have been killed!
Oh. Ha. They are my keys, how weird. (laughs)
Yes but then everything is all pulled down and it's jus.. Anyway. The damage, unfortunately, has marred an otherwise fine automobile, rendering it virtually undriveable.
OK Look, the gum isn't cutting it for me. We need to be about something else...anything..please.
Tell me your impressions, I would love to hear what a young woman thinks of "The Big Game".
By the way, how did Puddy get back in the picture?
Pretentious? Who, who isn't pretentious? Ha, ha, if everyone who was pretentious was in a mental institution, ... uh, obviously THIS isn't a mental institution.
Ok, everybody, uh...I have an announcement to make. From now on, I will be known as-
All right. At last, we're finally gettin' out of here.
They all have swirling chocolate in the commercial!
(hurriedly leaves Rudy's) They had plans, They had plans!
So what happened? She throw you out? Eh?
Well, Steven, I, uh.. (All the sudden, a small gang steps out of nowhere, surrounding George)
I mean I'm the one who bought it.
Excuse me just for a second. ( fixes his hair looking at his reflection in a coffee pot.)
I'm going to a poetry reading with PATRICE First time poets, in a burnt out building, down by the docks, Supposed to be good.
Gone. (Moves over to a chair in the living room. Kramer takes the carton of food to the table, and begins eating) The tenant association made me give it to this guy because he was an Andrea Doria survivor..
She had an itch. She could have used any one of those fingers. That finger was meant for me.
God! She's cooking dinner for God! She's yelling and screaming, and the next thing I know, she throws a big can of chocolate syrup all over my new red shirt.
What's the deal with Aquaman? Could he go on land, or was he just restricted to water?
I'll make time, because Abby, I was once like you; wide-eyed, naive, I didn't know the first thing about a subject as fundamental as risk management.
(Once again, Identifying) The Outlaw of Josey Whales!
Oh yeah, but that has nothing to do with it.
It never ends, this present stuff! Engagement present! Then they get married, you gonna have to get them something for that! Then the baby, there's another present. Then the baby starts getting their presents. I don't even like Drake.
Is there ever a good time to have your parents stay with you?
I'm cheap? You think I'm CHEAP? How could you say that to me? I can't believe this. How could you say that to me?
No. Nothing. Fine. (he sits at the table)
Well, uh... come in, come, come in. (frantically clears the couch of newspapers and crumbs)
Dont insult me, my friend. Remember who youre talking to. No ones a bigger idiot than me.
Oh, yeah, right. I wish I had something on my mind. (pregnant pause) So how about that Kramer, huh?
(feeling awkward) Its uh, not bad, its comin along. Why? Did you need something.
Oh, Hey, hey, hey! That's great! That's very nice. You know we've been waiting twenty minutes for you people?! What do you think, you're Mussolini?!
[Realizing full well it isn't] ...Yes it is.
Hey Deena, come on, give us a hug. (they hug) Oh my gosh, you look as pretty as you did back in high school.
Where are we going? Why are we pulling off here?
[pause] Would I like to come up? I would love to come up. I, I'm fighting not to. Fighting! Unfortunately I uh have to get an early start tomorrow. Gotta' get up and hit that pavement
Oh, I just, uh, leased a house out in the Hamptons, and I have got to get out there this weekend and sign the papers.
If anyone should be forced to leave that place, it should be her!
I mean , when I said Hello did she say Hello back?
(eating a pickle) Well they're his tickets, he can do what he wants with them.
Alright, now the play is tomorrow night. So do you want to have dinner first, or do you just want to meet at the theatre?
(clipping on shades) Ha.. She'll have to find me first. (leaving)
Yeah. Hey, let ask you something. Is it just me, or - or do you find it unbearable to be around Jerry and that girl?
Now my parents are gonna know I had people over.
Tuesday? I can't do it Tuesday. Steinbrenner needs me to run---
Great! I ate the entire platter! Had to call in sick today.
Uh, nothing, lets get going. Come on. (laughs) hu hu.
Me Too! And he's Dying Jerry! If Relationship George walks through this door, he will Kill Independent George! A George, divided against itself, Cannot Stand!
I watched "Beaches" on cable last night. (wings?)  Give me a break.
All right, I'll tell them my sister died. (Starts fake crying) My poor sister died. She was standing and then she was laughing and then they SHOT her! That's the kind of sick city that we're livin' in. They shoot you for laughing. I must go and comfort my poor family. Jerry, take me home so I can comfort my... my poor family.
I'm gay! I'm a gay man! I'm very, very gay.
When I was ten years old, my parents had this very same statue on the mantle of our apartment. Exactly. And, one day, I grabbed it, and I was using it as a microphone. I was singing, MacArthur Park, and I got to the part about, Ill never have that recipe again, and it slipped out of my hand and it broke. My parents looked at me like I smashed the ten commandments. To this day, they bring it up. It was the single most damaging experience in my life, aside from seeing my father naked.
You fixed me up with a bald woman.
Yeah, about ten, fifteen minutes. But I have to stop at a vegetable stand.
So are you going to Todd's party this weekend?
Do you think she gets to take any of those little bars of soap home?
Ah, would you take this picture away from me. Take it away and get it outta here. Let me just sign this and go.
They don't need any water, so you don't have to keep taking them to the bathroom.
Anyway, so he gave me his spare keys, now he wants to have my keys, so I need mine back from you.
Oh, Hey, eh, there's a spot right in front of the liquor store. You see
(worked up) I'm aware! I'm aware!! But this is Marisa Tomei, Elaine. An Oscar winner! How can I live the rest of my life, knowing I coulda been with Marisa Tomei? She said I was just her type! She loves short, stocky, balding funny men!
Make-up sex? You have to have that right after the fight, we're way past that.
You know, I'm down to one kiss hello. My aunt Sylvia.
Well, it would be OK if Darryl was here.
You really think this looks O.K. on me?
He's beboppin' and scattin', and I'm losin' it!
The little extra moan you threw in there. Laying it on a bit thick, don't you think?
No. He was fine with it. Check that out.
I probably didn't hear it on the way over because of the street noise. (he panics) This is no good! I got to meet these guys from MacKenzie for lunch in half an hour!
Pull hair, Poke eyes, Groin stuff. Whatever I gotta do. (he opens a blue bottled beverage)
So, where you gonna stick this (points to the Fusilli Jerry)
You don't know what that spot means to him. Once he gets it, he doesn't go out for weeks.
Ye - yeah. And we had a pact, you know.
I didnt know there was a fireplace. A fireplace, that's incredible.
I gotta go zoo. I feel like I could set more of my own schedule.
I don't think I've ever spoken to her.
I dont know whatcha had to tell her that for. You put me in a very difficult position, Marine Biologist! I'm very uncomfortable with this whole thing.
Hey, yeah. My parents want to come too, is that ok?
All right, so are you ready, so we'll go out and get something to eat.
Oh, sure. I mean, after all, you were almost my, uh... OK, I gotta go.
Well, uhm, I think I'd like to do it.
Krama. Open up! I--I know you're in there!
I can't carry any changes in these pants, it falls out.
I lost them. I can usually come up with one good comment during a meeting but by the end it's buried under a pile of gaffs and bad puns.
Where did I get the coffee? Where do think I got the coffee, at the grocery store. (small laugh)
And that was wrong, Jerry! You simple must to apologize..
What do you mean you didn't think I wasn't gonna use them?!
Oh, no, Sir. Festivus is all too real. And.. I could prove it - if I had to.
(worried) Alright, alright. Look, we're people, you and me, huh? Businessmen. Colleagues, if I may. Let's not quibble. We'll do it for the thirteen thousand. Thirteen thousand, and I never came up here, we never talked, alright. You take good care. (moving past Russell toward the door) It was nice seeing you again, and nice meeting you. (to Cynthia) Cynthia, right?
Yeah. It's a beautiful name for a boy or a girl...
What are you doing? You're making more than I am. A secretary cannot make more than her boss.
If I see things as they are, I would ask 'why' or 'why not?'
Oh that's OK, really, don't worry about it.
(shaking his head, weary) It doesn't matter. (he leaves)
Just as she was. Hey, Mario! Remember us?
Did you ever solve the riddle of the pie?
(Yelling from the bathroom) Don't tell her anything, she'll kill me!!
(animated) Are you insane? Jerk store, woulda smoked that guy! Smoked him, I say.
Oh ya, like there's something wrong with saying 'God bless you'. I was raised to say 'God bless you'.
But it--eh.. It was here, I'm tellin' you, an' w--w--it was really here! The, there was, a, bar, and a, an' a dance floor..
Whatcha got there, the 4-volt? Heh, I did you a favor.
That's right...We just had sex......You know Jerry I've been searching for someone a long time. Well the search is over.
I mean, it's not fair. I've been going there for 7 years. She's been there 3 weeks.
Well, I assume there's some sort of write-off.
Every day she comes in, she sits at that table and reads. Never talks to anybody.
I thought I saw him look in the mirror suspiciously.
So it was my comment that broke them up?
I had a feeling you would like it. No, don't try it on now, try it on later.
Na, he's gone. I wonder what happened to him.
Do you really think I'm wrong about this Wyck guy?
Now if I wanna see anything I gotta wear these.
I'd like to sleep with a LOT of other women.
These are the balloons? Big deal, all I see is Woody Woodpecker.
This is not good. World's are colliding! George is getting upset!
Oh uuh, sure, why not. (the blind man hangs on to George's arm) Hey, that's the guy.
Probably. They all do. In my high school, half my graduating class had them. Of course, I'm from Long Island, so...
I had the perfect situation here, he was shouldering half the load.
(nervous) Where are you taking me? I was gonna pay for it.
Oh, yeah, sure, laugh it up. Everybody else did!
I got to get downtown and buy that suit. The store opens in twenty minutes.
I tried to be nice. I wasn't nice?
No no no, he's not getting away with this.
Yeah. I may have stepped on her arm, too, I don't know.
I was supposed to see her. She wasn't supposed to see me.
Well, I feel better already. I'm feelin' like a good person.
(frantic) Jerry! Jerry, muh--muh--my hair-dryer ruined the picture! An' I need another one or I can't get back into the forbidden city!
(singing)  Master of the house/Keeper of the inn... (Jerry re-enters the living room and modestly models his new jacket for George. George is impressed.) This is huge! When did this happen?
Whaddya mean, you'll ``get'' the popcorn and the soda?
(Thinking to himself) She's not concerned about the security guard. What kind of a person is this? I'm marrying a person who doesn't care that this man has to stand here 8 hours a day when he could easily be sitting.
I think. (Pause as they all look down)
Missing his plane? Wasn't that a charter flight?
It's in Detroit though, it's an expensive flight.
Yeah, yeah, yeah we could. You know, ah, Kramer, the next time you talk to her, find out if she knows Kelly, from Monk's. I wanna know if she really has a boyfriend.
I solve problems. That's just what I do.
She, uh, went shopping for some shoes for the wedding and, yada yada yada, I'll see her in six to eight months. (Kramer and Julie enter)
Cause its signals, Jerry, its signals! (snapping his fingers) Dont you- all right. Did she even ask you, what you were doin tomorrow night, if you were busy?
Yeah, but if you still look closely you can see ah, a little bump where the nose use to be. huhuhuhu.
No, Kramer. I have to have this statue.
I don't even know Peterman. How the hell am I gonna relax? I'm gonna have to be on all night. I don't like being on, Jerry, I would much rather be off.
Well I can't break up with her now.
Thanks. Gee, you know, I thought you were mad at me.
So this Anna called me from out of the blue.
Yeah. Not only that, this is what she said to me, "Can we change the subject?"
I can't believe this! What was wrong with it? What didn't you like about it?
Let me ask you a question. This new move. Is there a knuckle involved in any way?
Well, if it doesn't concern me, then I can stay. (Kramer grabs the back of George's chair, drags him out into the hallway and closes the door.)
Great. (They both stand.) Oh, by the way, did you get a chance to read the script?
No no, this is a matter of principle. That would just be saying that anybody could just pull into any parking space any way they want. Well I'm making a stand here. I'm saying *no* to head first parking. I'm not putting up with that. We put up with too much crap in this city, we're not putting up with head first parking.
Well I just got the estimate. It's going to cost more to fix that roof than the car's worth, So I'm going over to see that hospital administrator today. Someone is gonna pay for this damage and it's not gonna be me.
(rage) Oh, it's got cachet, baby! It's got cachet up the yin-yang!
But you are Blanche... You *are* in the shackles. Oh, I can't wait to read my *Time* magazine! Laaaast copy, too. Maybe I'll read it tomorrow-- in the park! It's supposed to be a beeyootiful day! Have a nice life... sentence, that is!
Hello, it's Natalie? Yeah, this is a business office but I'm not a business man per se. I'm here working for the people. Yes, I'm causing dissent. Stirring the pot. Getting people to question the whole rotten system.
I think you absolutely have to say something to this guy. Confront him.
Why do I get pesto? Why do I think I'll like it? I keep trying to like it, like I have to like it.
(to Mickey) Can't you just switch with another Midget?
Well, you know... the friend meeting the new woman. I feel like I'm getting fixed up for a friendship.
(to the cab driver) Excuse me, do you see anything on my lip here?
Oh, yes. I - I'm your baby bluey.
So what do you care what she thinks.
Well, I didn't really think about what I was gonna do with all..
What kind of a sick impulse does that??
I want you to find out is she likes me.
What kind of a therapist are you? I'm telling I'm scared that something terrible is gonna happen to me, right away you start looking for tumors?
(waving) How can I not think about it? Look at the size of this thing.
You know Keith, what I've always wondered, with all these ball clubs flying around all season don't you think there would be a plane crash? ...
No, I don't know. Maybe you haven't. You know, not everybody's seen a massage table.
Of course, not as exciting as miss crop circles, but...
Svenjolly. (licking a little bit of peanut butter from his finger)
This is a brand new jacket. Boy this really burns me up, ...
(stops Jerry realizing something) Hey hey hey hey hey hey.
"I have to go see Steinbrenner later. Mr Wilhelm told him that I was the one responsable for stealing all the merchandise."
(into phone, frantic) Mister Dalrimple! Mister Dalrimple I have to talk to you!
Well then, from out of nowhere, a huge tidal wave lifted me, tossed like a cork and I found myself right on top of him, (ELAINE gasps quietly Ahhhh) face to face with the blow-hole. I-I, I could barely see from the waves crashing down upon me but, I knew something was there so I reached my hand in, felt around and pulled out the obstruction!
I'm really serious. I think that's a good idea.
Jerry gargles? Is that why he takes so long?
I can't believe I get paid for this.
Well you missed a lovely little party that we had for Grace.
Interference! You cant count that! Come on, are you crazy?! The coin cannot touch anything, it affects it.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's in the vault. I'm putting it in the vault.
Jerry, it's fantastic. I love the people over there. They- they treat me so great. You know they think I'm handicapped, they gave me this incredible office, a great view.
Well, as I say, the pink-eye made my vision...quite blurry... (Joe's daughter comes to the door.)
Apparently the glue in the wedding invitations was a....toxic.
I-I guess it can't hurt him... People eat *pounds* of those things.
You know, about the uh, two of us getting together. And I know that I said I was engaged, but (laughs) uh, you know, it's really just something you say. It's like, going steady. You know uh, going steady, engaged, it's, it's all just stuff you say. (chuckles) Anyway, I was watching uh, My Cousin Vinnie, on the uh, on the tape the other day, and I was thinking that uh, you know, the two of us might take a meeting, as they say. (chuckles) So, what d'you, what d'you think?
Can you believe it? It's happening! It's finally happening! I'm free!!
Then of course with evolution, the octopus lost the nostrils and took on the more familiar look that we know today.
I find the soothing pastorial images very conduc-
Do you believe this? We're fighting. We're fighting.
Na....no ... This relationship he..he..has got to be about something and fast or I'm in very serious and weird trouble....hum What else happened?
Well, Tony.. took a bit of a tumble
Yeah, drove away.. You know, I said 'Hello' to him. You know, he's - he's-
Im starving! I can feel my stomach sucking up against my spine.
Can I come upstairs, please? (Elaine pushes the button and lets George in.)
Ten minutes! Here, here, (Fishes a box of Tic-Tacs out of his coat pocket and tosses them to her) Have some Tic-Tacs.
Don't you understand? It's not about him. To have a line as perfect as 'jerk store' and to never use it. I, I couldn't live with myself.
You want me to find a poem about Susan? May she rest in peace?!
He got about uh, two inches from... there.
I mean, I could understand if there was something else playing, but it's this or nothing.
Hey, do you know, Bonnie, I just had a pretty wild idea.
So, Marcy, you should've seen me in the hot tub yoday.
So, she fell, and then she started screaming, "My back! My back!" So, I picked her up and took her to the hospital.
I dunno. I was just talking to the man and he walked out on me!
I just can't believe at the way people are. What is it with humanity? What kind of a world do we live in?
Oh ya, This is my fiance, Susan. This is David
And so, for all these reasons, we are officially broken up. (shuts book and reaches for door) Thank you, (opens door) and good night.
Whats seventy-five bucks?! What, am I seeing Sinatra in there?! Am I being entertained? I dont understand this. Im only paying half.
All right, uh, okay, I got it, um, Ill sing.
Ha ha ha ha, oh all right, go ahead, deride, deride if you must. But let me tell you something, with my personality and this set of hair, you know what I am now? I am in the game. I no longer defer to the coifed. I'm a player.
I don't know, I just can't. Nobody in my family can pay for parking, it's a sickness. My father never paid for parking; my mother, my brother, nobody. We can't do it.
This MacKenzie, he's a bit of a nut. Someone told me he fired the last guy because his nose whistled when he breathed.
Yeah. What are you doing with the Daily Worker?
Hey, did you know that the Yankees don't wear cotton jerseys?
I cant do it. Ill, Ill keep her busy.
So, you wanna go home and...make up, officially?
Alright I happen to know what they did last night, they had dinner with Kramer.
They send me? Aw right ..ask 'em Does it really work?
I believe the doors on the bathroom stalls, here at the stadium, don't offer much by way of privacy. But I was thinking if we extend the doors all the way to the floors......
Jerry! Jerry! Je Jerry Jerry . The most unbelievable thing has just happened, it's too Unbelievable! I'm sitting in the coffee shop, i'm talking to Susan, were talking about shoe laces (does two guns to the head) so in walks..in walks David, right, he walks right to the table..righ I introduced him to Susan..and he says get this (laughs) he says 'boy you could do a lot better than this guy' huh right (more laughing by George, Jerry is totally just mellow and straight faced) The exact same thing that I said to him, just to get back at me just to get back at me..and then, and then she says she wants to be alone for awhile..Alone Jerry! I think that she thinks that she could do better (laughs) Do you appreciate this? Do you see the irony of this? Do you see what is going on here? What's the matter?
I think it moved. Oh my god, I think it moved. Yeah, give me the big piece. I'll see you later.
This thing can't hurt me, can it? I mean, it is a laser. What if it hits my eye?
And a guy will appear from out of nowhere. I say "Get out of here! What do you want? You don't belong here!"
It's like some pod landed from another planet and took your body. Don't fall asleep Elaine.
No no no, that's in the right position.
Wait, as a matter of fact, wasn't there some guy in your building that you said you liked? He lived up on the fifth floor or something.
Oh no! Im vigilant. Theyll never get me out. Im like a weed, Jerry.
Care? Forget about care. Love. They have to love the characters. Otherwise, why would they keep tuning in?
You know this whole thing never would have happened if you hadn't bailed out on me at the restaurant.
Nothing really, you know...just eh, stroll around the cell blocks, maybe eh, take in a shower fight. (chuckles.) Hey eh, you know you got a bounced check hanging up in the little market over on Columbus?
I dunno, I'm in a limo. (dials) Hello ma? It's me. Guess where I am. In the back of a limo. No, nobody died. It's a long story, I can't tell you now. Because I can't. I said I can't. If I could, I would. Would you stop it? Alright, look, I'm getting off. No, I'm not telling you! How's this? I'm *never* telling you! I don't care! No! Fine! Never!!
You telling me that wine is better than Pepsi? Huh (snort), no way wine is better than Pepsi.
Not with that big glass window looking out into the hall. I'd love a good nap. That's the only thing getting me out of bed in the morning. I'll see ya'.
No! (The salesman walks away. He addresses the mechanic through the doors window) Hey! Hey! I see you! That is my Twix! (The mechanic eats the last of the Twix, obviously to make George even more angered. It works) Oh, ha, ha! Ho, ho!
When is it going to be my turn, Jerry? When do I get my 15 minutes? I want my 15 minutes!
Well, aren't you the boss of him? You shouldn't let him move up! When I was in the Cub Scouts, I got stuck on Weebolos for three years 'cause I kept losing the Pinewood Derby.
I snapped! It was the last straw. (sighs)
Look at these salesmen. The only thing these guys fear is the walk-out. No matter what they say, you say, "Ill walk out of here right now!"
There is no problem. . . just a small miscommunication. Whereby you thanked her instead of the person actually responsible for purchasing the big salad.
Well at least you and I are talking about how there's nothing to talk about.
Alright, how's this? We wait till we get to your street corner, we see Elaine and Kramer then we get out. They can't shoot us in the city.
You can do better than me. You could throw a dart out the window and hit someone better than me. I'm no good!
Jerry, I've been preparing for this moment my entire life.
(back-pedalling) No, he, he didnt actually tell me that, uh, we were talking about that commercial  in fact I think I brought it up because I like that commercial. No, he, he would never tell me anything. He never discusses anything. Hes, hes like a clam. Youre not gonna mention this, to him...
Oh! That's good judgment. That's a pile of judgment there. Sure.
She might be leaving to work any minute.
Step-skipper. That man is a step-skipper! He skips Step Nine!
I've been doing a lot of thinking. This might be my chance to start giving something back.
What do you think I mean bald? Bald. Bald bald.
Yeah, I may move out there. (getting 'yeah, right' glances from the Rosses) I mean it, I'll do it! OK, I'll see ya later. Keep it real!
What, you don't think I can attract beautiful, intelligent women?
You already have an in. You have the same first name!... (no reaction) 'Jerry'!
This you are not going to believe. Al Netchie, that pimple. Tells Daphne, not get this 'Not to get involved with me.'
Well, what's so great about a Mom and Pop store? Let me tell you something. If my Mom and Pop ran a store, I wouldn't shop there.
I know they're in there, the three of them, laughing at me. Together, laughing and lying.
What, you are comparing me to Biff Loman, very encouraging. The biggest loser in history of American literature.
Here. Let me take your tabe downstairs for you.
That's dynamite. Yeah, I'll look for the Chinese food leftovers.
Shst, You should take the test for me.
Come on! No doctor would put that on his car.
Sperry Rand Building. 14th floor, Morgan Apparel. Mention my name - she'll give you the key.
I'm telling you, skip the Drake's wedding, go to the game.
(horrified) But that meeting starts in ten minutes!
All right, all right, I didnt want to tell you this. You wanna know why she called you?
(excited) You're saying I stand to inherit three hundred thousand dollars, is that what you're saying?!
I never heard of anyone would turned down an apartment because of a weak shower spray.
And this is the first you're seeing of the coat?
Huh. Excuse me (to Ping) Hum... Do you speak chinese?
All right, so what's the penalty here? Let's just pay the fine or something and get the hell out of here.
What am I talking about? Come on. (laughing) You don't think I bought all that? (does a little move)
I told ya. Hey, any of you guys want to come out and help me fix my father's screen door in Queens?
Ahoy! Mr. Eldridge. I understand you were on the Andrea Doria.
I'm all for awkward pauses. Fix me up with her.. Wait a minute, Nina just saw me in my Timberlands! Now I have to wear them every time I see her.
(pleased with himself) You are having problems with your boyfriend and I am meeting you to discuss the situation.
(Trying to whisper to Jerry) Look, we are gonna settle this right now! I demand reparations! I should get to sleep with Elaine. That's the only way to punish you!
Yes, well you see, the deceased landed on my car. The uh splat, as it were, actually occurred on the roof of my car. Now of course I can't help but feel that had it been a convertible this whole tragedy might have been averted but I've never been the kind of guy to buy a convertible, what with the baldness and everything.
I can never get the package open in time.
They always make me take stock of my life. And how Ive pretty much wasted all of it, and how I plan to continue wasting it.
I cant believe I said that. You know me, Im a vault.
Would you get out of here. Who's gonna turn down a chair? I would be very interested to know how he felt about all of this. Maybe I'll have a talk with him.
(incredulous) You can't ground me, I'm a grown man.
Damn you, laser guy! You had to grab it all with your lowbrow laser shtick! You're just a prop comic! Where's the craft?!
(tearing out cheque) Yeah, same time. (hands over cheque) There you go.
Really? My father has a ton of old clothes just sitting up in the attic, y-you think they're worth something?
Oh! Modelling! What's that like? Fun? Ha ha. (to self in head) Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!
I just pray Kruger doesn't realize that it's gone until this guy can fix it up.
I banged it on the desk in the doctor's office. An (worriedly rubbing his arm) aaaa . . .
I had a great time tonight Carrie. And I am going to call you as soon as I get home.
(Again, sarcastic) Oh, what a huge blow to the culture.
Wha..? I didn't tell you? I gotta go meet Elaine.
Well, I do what I can. (Robin comes over.)
So they're flying the tiny instruments in from El Paso.
No. I like the ball! This is my One Chance to make a Great Entrance! My whole life! I have never made a great entrance!
I dont want to get out of it.
Well, a lot of people keep popcorn in the house.
Not that much. You know, they tend to shrink in the water.
Yeah and you get this really cool T-shirt when you sign on..
"It's the Kom Pau ... George likes his chicken spicy."
'When you're alone, and life is making you lonely, you can always go...'
The woman she's "lesbianing" with? Susan told me she's *never* been with a guy.
I can't believe you're not playing in cotton.
Look at where we are! (referring to the seat usher) He's not stopping! He just keeps going and going and going! (the usher abruptly stops at the second row) We're not in the first row?
I suppose I could just pull this out ( his tucked shirt)and walk around like this and you wouldn't care?
Are you often on business trip? Nice...oh, hey nice ice-bucket.
They had a pastry cart you wouldn't believe.
(whispering) I can't explain. It's very important that I sit here.
So what's the deal they don't want to have dinner with my parents?
Y'know... I could hear you on the other line...
Was this something you had planned for a while?
Don't you see what it says here? Don't you understand what that's implying?
All right, let me just... I'm gonna grap an apple.
Yeah, I thought I might give her a call. I, I don't meet that many women. I meet like three women a year. I mean, we've been introduced. She knows my name.
(hearing Jerry broke up with Patty) Are you still down in the dumps? Come on. It's just a chick.
If it makes you happy, I don't focus on these things. I will tell you this Unfortunately, we live in a very superficial society. I don't condone it, but it's a fact of life.
(Staring at the doll) This doll (Pointing) looks like my mother.
I can't believe what's happening here. She hasn't taken her hands off me all night. She was always friendly around the office, but that was it.
It's fine, it doesn't have to be about nothing.
You tell that son of a bitch no Yankee is ever comin' to Houston. Not as long as you bastards are running things.
Well, you know, book reports. That kind of stuff.
That was a hell of a thing when Spock died...
(Chuckling) yeah. Uh, oh, here's your sunglasses. (Hands them to her)
Oh, sure, my Black Hawks jacket. I love my Black Hawks jacket.
Uh Jerry, how long will you be in there?
(to Elaine) Do you want us to go with you?
(surprised) So, I'm Neil? How did I do that?
Yeah, I think I got a touch of something, too.
All right, come on, come on, let's go. Six dollars.
(Looks at her) Yeah, uh, no menus. (Waves her off)
(adamant) Ah, c'mon! I'm telling you, I can coach for the NFL. It's not that hard
(Loud, so everyone at the wedding can hear) You slept with the groom?!
(after hesitating, resignedly) All right. (He sits down and smiles unconvincingly at her)
please please I don't want to die up here. please, stop moving that's all I'm asking.. Kramer!!
Look at this sparkle. (looks up, sees Lindsay's mother) Mrs. Enright! (runs after her) Mrs. Enright! Mrs. Enright!
if you hadn't come, this whole thing wouldn't have happen (back on Jerry and Elaine's side, we can hear George saying "I was the one who was invited", Jerry opens the door)
[studying his jacket] Oh man! Look at this! I sat in gum. Oh, by the way, you owe me seven fifty.
Thats exquisite. Listen, uh, if its not too much trouble, could you pass me that paper over there?
It - it's just that I'm here with my parents, and my mother wants me to take a civil service test - and to tell you the truth, I don't even think I'd pass it.. So..
Ho, ha, ho! Jerry Seinfeld's a funny guy!
We are going to the Knick game! Michael Jordan!
(coming back to the table from the bathroom) Oh uh. You ready?
Well, that's not offensive. (Reflects) It's abnormal, but it's not offensive.
When I asked him if it was cancer, he didn't give me a "get outta here". That's what I wanted to hear "Cancer? Get outta here?"
It's really not accurate. Nobody drinks from a water cooler any more - they use bottles.
Anna actually has respect for me now. (laughs/snorts) It's all over.
Yeah! She made me promise not to tell you .It's supposed to be a joke.
Oh, sure. (Holds the box out as Susan takes out a few letters)
Well, he said it could be cancer, maybe you should get it checked out.
(after Wendy and to the receptionist) Oh, you have a policy! (to the world at large) The delicate genius has a policy! George heads for the door.
(bursting out of the bathroom, fumbling with his fly) Button fly! Why do they put buttons on a fly? It takes ten minutes to get these things open!
Yeah for two hours. She's nuts about you.
All right, All right, all, right!!( gives the headphones to Kramer) How you gonna find out who this is?
Yeah, Well that's a deal where I come from.
Why? What's wrong with the subject? This is a bad subject?
Yes of course go ahead. My guess is you're going to like this very much.
Right. And, and to cover my nervousness I started eating an apple, because I think if they hear you chewing on the other end of the phone, it makes you sound casual.
Yes. And listen to this, listen to this; her uncle works for the Yankees and he's gonna get me a job interview. A front office kind of thing. Assistant to the traveling secretary. A job with the New York Yankees! This has been the dream of my life ever since I was a child, and it's all happening because I'm completely ignoring every urge towards common sense and good judgment I have had. This is no longer just some crazy notion. Elaine, Jerry, this is my religion.
What do I do?! What do I do?!
I needed it! My back is... a little tweaked.
I hate this mall, there are never any spaces here...
The guy slept with Marilyn Monroe, he's in Dinky Donuts. What about this doctor's note? Let's go see your friend Roy.
Well, Marisa. See, the thing is... I'm sort of engaged.
Oh! Nuts! Excellent! You know what I love? How there's two nuts named after people. Hazel...and filbert.
You said you grabbed it outta there real fast, right?
You think the person you were talking to is him? That's not even close to him. He's funny, Jerry's funny.
I insist. Ill fix us a drink. (phone rings  who would that be?) I got it.
Or, I could take the twenty, then I could pay *you* later.
I gotta try and find a way to switch places with him. It's like a Sigfried and Roy trick.
Oh yeah, when are you gonna execute that plan?
You know, you're nuts with these sponges. George is gettin' frustrated!
Maybe Manya missed the funeral because she was off visiting another galaxy that day.
I will never understand the bathrooms in this country. Why is it that the doors on the stalls do not come all the way down to the floor?
Yeah, I think, you know, she was, like, crying, and he was consoling her, and then, she, uh, just got into his car, and they just drove away.
I'm the assistant to the travelling secretary. I'm going on the road trips with 'em! I'll be on the plane... I'm working in Yankee Stadium! This is a dream, I'm busting, Jerry, I'm busting!
You're right. Why must there always be a problem? You'd think just once I could get a break. God knows I earned it with that score!
Is it flowing? I like flowing, cascading hair. Thick lustrous hair is very important to me.
No, you're not taking a deli slicer to my boss...
Well, I don't see how I'm gonna make December. I mean, I need a little more time. I mean, look at me I'm a nervous wreck. My stomach aches. My neck is killing me. I can't turn. Look. Look.
Its a great thrill to meet you, Sir.
Oh no, in and out, I made sure of that. And you'll be happy to know I perused the script and it's met with my approval.
Good. Cause if this is a lie, if this is a joke, if this is your idea of some cute little game we're finished!
Well? (Miranda hits George) I was just - I'm curious, that's all. We, uh. We'd like you to, do everything possible.
I love the chop sticks. I, I personally prefer a fork but they look very nice.
Yes. Well -- So, uh, sit on the same side at a booth, huh?
I can't tell ya how much I appreciate this.
Salsa is now the number one condiment in America.
Hello, Ken. It's George Costanza. I think we need to talk.
No, no. No, no, no. (determined) We're staying on me. We haven't solved anything yet.
This friend of Susan's is staying with us for two weeks...Now am I wrong or is that excessive?
Well I was dropping of the calzone money for the week.... Um shouldn't you be at work by now?
So... uh you feel okay about that whole thing... what we do in there... you're generally okay with everything in there?
I think I had some hard candy in there.
You are a genius, it's as simple as that.
Nobody drives like me. Nobody. I'm doing things in this car, you have no idea they're going on. Wanna see me make a right turn from the left lane? Watch this.
Thank you very much. You just stand over there, I?ll stand over here.
Love to! (Cracks his knuckles, then winces under the pain)
In any other shoe, I lose two inches. I - I can't have a drop down. We were eye to eye, I can't go eye to chin!
Stop it, stop it! It's not fair. It's not fair. I don't like this situation, Jerry. I don't like it one bit.
I don't see why's she more self-conscious about that than her toe thumbs.
Not a bad way to make a buck.
(in his mind) I think that ginger ale at the coffee shop is just Coke and Sprite mixed together. How can I prove it? Ah! Can't, dammit. (knock at door. George goes to open it)
You know, about how when you break it down, it's really a very positive thing. you know, you have a nure, with a ma in front of it. MA-NURE. Iz not bad.
I...was trying to lead the way. We needed a leader! Someone to lead the way to safety.
You know, you're going along, you think everything's all right and all of a sudden you get that tap. (George taps his own shoulder). You know it's like pfffff (whistling sound), all right that's enough, you're through.
They wanted to read a Truman Capote book.
Come on, lets not stand here too long, we might run in to her.
Are you crazy?! What are you doing?! You'll get us killed!
(standing up, still acting) Uhh! I'm caught in my own web of lies! (holds his hands up in surrender)
We got a soccer game in Chile. Anyway, the plane crashes. Who are you gonna eat to survive?
Listen to the comeback. (pleased) 'Oh yeah? Well the jerk store called. They're running outta you.'
You gotta give us odds. At least two to one - you gotta put up two-hundred dollars.
I like history. Civil War. Maybe I could be a professor, or something.
Hey, I just found twenty dollars! I tell you this, something is happening in my life. I did this opposite thing last night. Up was down, black was white, good was -
(leaving) Yeah, Sure, sure ,,, I got to drop my car off at the new lot.
Yeah. One second sweetheart. Jerry, I really think it'd be easier if you didn't tuck.
I mean it's hard enough to meet a woman you dislike, much less like.
He had a TV show! He had cartoons!
No, no, no, no. Borrowing money from a friend is like having sex. It just completely changes the relationship.
Well, you know, to be honest sir -- my, my new secretary Ade, came up with that one.
(he just took a bite of the Chinese food ) This is terrible. What is this, ginger? I hate ginger. I can't understand how anyone can eat ginger. (puts the container back in the refrigerator.)
(Laughs) You, I guess, you don't remember me.. but we actually, kind of um.. went out.. a couple of years ago.. once.. remember?
Of course he should consider it, but now is not the time!
Alright, listen, I'll give you your spare keys, but I don't have them with me. Can I please have mine to give to back to Kramer?
Are you crazy? You take your life in your hands with those nuts.
Really...(he honks the car and is startled, Elaine laughs)......I have to say...You were really good doing that porno thing....you're talented.
Wait a second. I think I see where that laser guy is. No! Don't look! Don't look. Oh, yeah, that's him. Ok. I'm gonna sneak up on him. Now the hunted becomes the hunter.
I gotta stay one step ahead of Neil.
Elaine, I once told a woman that I coined the phrase, "Pardon my French."
I'll tell you what's insane the price that I could get you on a new desktop computer.
He's actually doing him a favor. It's less money for him to buy food.
I know, I know. Listen, your stuff has to be done by now, why dont you just see if its dry?
How do I know, maybe, you know, maybe she wanted to be polite.
Wait a second. 'Little places to go, where they never close.' What's a little place that never closes?
What is it about sex that just disrupts everything? Is it the touching? Is it the nudity?
No no, I never said I was a good driver, I said I was a good parker.
You were supposed to deliver my calzones. We had a deal!
Hey, hey. Kramer, what are you doing? You can't smoke in here.
You lie! How hard is it to lie?!
Good afternoon. One large crab bisque to go. Bread. Beautiful.
Look, I really appreciate your coming, but if you wouldn't mind - try not to say too much.
I'm out! Fantastic apartment right across from mine, huh. I can't wait for you to see it.
Hey, when you order from the waitress, get her to point to the menu. I want to see what finger she uses.
See now that bothers me even more than dying bothers me, cause it's people like you who live to be a hundred and twenty because you're not bothered by it. How could it not bother you?
It's an inter-office envelope. It get passed around all over the office.
I guess I've been hanging on to them for so long cuz i couldn't accept the fact that Dad was really gone forever (hugs a piece of clothing)
I'll fake an illness. (Acts it out) My back! My back! I can't believe, my back.
Not me. Everything should be negotiable. (he picks up a container of fruit)
(takes a bite) Oh, that's good. That's very good.
I had to give it to the liquor store guy.
That's why I peeked. (Jerry opens the door to take some trash out, and meets Kramer and Gail in the hallway.)
(shouting) I'm not looking for another line. I got the line.
You, uh, wanted to see me, Mr. Steinbrenner?
Well you know what I've discovered Mrs. Sokol. It's not so much the looking as the listening. I listen for work. And as I'm looking and listening I am also looking. You can't discount looking. It's sort of a combination. It's looking, and listening, listening and looking. But you must look.
Seemingly. Seemingly. But within that basic framework there are many subtle variations, only discernable to an acute observer, that reflect the many moods, the many shades, the many sides of George Costanza.
Is he a clown? What, are you kidding me!?
Allright, very good I'd like my car and my deposit back please
Anyway, right in the middle, the ship blows up-- burning debris, bodies falling-- and then just as this eerie silence settles over the airfield, I yelled out, "That's gotta hurt!"
My mother loves Hampton tomatoes. She's nuts for Hampton tomatoes.
(jokingly) You are still paying for this lunch?
It was very traumatic. The last thing I remember is you flinching. Then, everything went black.
What about a rec room? Huh? Or a community center.
You know, I used to love Paris. My uh, dead Fiance, Susan.. (opening wallet) In fact I. think I, I may have a picture of her..
Yeah, you know, what'd she uh, look like?
Yeah, yeah I really had some guts back then. Why don't we do it again?
Kramer, Kramer's not here...I knew it. I knew it! I knew this would happen. (SCREAMING) Kramer! Kramer!
If she want's to continue to have a fibre of her being she'll be very careful (hitting each other)
I show up. I pretend I have the job. The guy's on vacation. If I have the job, it's fine. If I don't have the job, by the time he comes back, I'm ensconced.
What does she need? Maybe there's something that she needs.
I know. I can tell. It's one of my powers. Why, did you ever fake?
You know, when I was a kid, we didn't have these elaborate birthday parties w-with catered food and entertainment. I remember my 7th birthday party...
I saw them making out, you can believe it.
No, I'm fine. I'm good. I'm very good.
I'm not getting on a regular plane now - I'm all psyched up to go on a private jet. No way I'm getting on a regular plane.
You never run out, do you? (Jerry smiles.) Where's Kramer? Everything's finished here.
Three days. Well, maybe you caught her on the cusp of a new wash cycle. You know, she did laundry the day after she met you, everything got clean and she started all over again.
What do you think about a rocking chair?
Psh. What's the point of even discussing it? [condescendingly takes her hand and pats it] You'll give me the money when you have it. [takes two steps, then reconsiders, then re-reconsiders] I, I trust you.
She put them in her pocket book. She probably took them out there with her.
I heard they found a family in your freezer
What a world that would be, if you just could ask a woman what shes thinkin.
You know, you have to know how to do that. You cant have people shoving their arms into a six-hundred degree oven!
Ok, we got your...got your strawberries, your chocolate sauce, your pastrami on rye with mustard, your honey...
(George takes out the suit from the other rack) Well, look at this. (innocently) This doesn't belong here! Someone has made a terrible mistake.
Here's the TV. I know you wanted to watch the Super Bowl. Do you at least have some towels we could sit on? It's, like, a four hour game.
Yeah, yeah. That's how they talk in the major league. (laughs)
What, are you crazy? It's a traumatic thing to be thrown up on.
You dont have to call that! Thats a rule!
Hey, at least I was a camp waiter.
What, you think I eat all my meals with you? (To waitress) Excuse me, sweetheart? I think you may have overcharged us. What is this?
(little worried) Coffee? (thinks) I can beat that. Move in with me.
Look, we're not gonna be that long anyway... we have to get to the "party"!
Oh well, that's, uh, thats just because we're, uh, standing on opposite sides.
This...is an organizer, a secretary, and a friend.
(Whispering to Jerry) What time is our flight back? I got to go to the bathroom.
Wait till you hear this! (George sees Donna and no Jerry.) Whoa, ah, Im sorry, I didnt, I had no idea.
(Mr.Wilhelm comes in and hears George yelling) You tell that son of a bitch no Yankee is ever comin' to Houston! Not as long as you bastards are running things!
But it's not a photograph, I need a photograph!
'Scarsdale surprise'. That's the musical about that Scarsdale diet doctor murder.
No, stings the throat. Anyway, so I was coming along here, and I felt like a piece of cake, you know? But then I thought, it's morning, I should really have a muffin. I like those chocolate chip ones. Then I figured, well, they're really both cake. So I, uh, I sat on that bench for a little while, twenty minutes or an hour, and then I figured, check and see what you were up to. (a thought occurs to him) Wait a minute, wait a minute. The broad jump! The broad jump over the pothole on Eighty-sixth Street!
Well I don't know anyone here Jerry. Where else am I going to stay?
You know what this has to do with?
Oh I got it. (TO JERRY) That I'm supposed to remember. Where the car is, that's insignificant.
How are you closer to him than me?
That's David Letterman. I just saw David Letterman walk by. I'll be right back. (He exits)
George.. (She doesn't seem to recognize him) George Costanza.
(To Jerry) Let me ask you something.. How much do you think it would cost to have tonsils and adenoids removed in the hospital?
There's an easy move go from screwin' you behind your back to screwin' you right to your face.
(to Jerry) "You know those shoes that Jimmy had? I cut a deal with him. We're gonna import a case of them together."
Well I think I'm better off going one-on-one.
I just talked to Mr. Kruger, he'll be down in a minute. He wanted me to take a photograph for the record.
Yeah, anyway, she's uh, having some kind of a family lunch, I'll swing by after.
He just read it. (Russell vomits again. Jerry and George look ashamed.)
Coffees coffee in the morning. Its not coffee at twelve oclock at night.
Jerry, this whole Ellen situation.. has gone far enough.
Someday, before I die, mark my words - I'm gonna tell that woman exactly what I think of her. I'll never be able to forgive myself until I do.
That's him over there. The one that looks like a blowfish.
Nah, it's not a good turn. December. December. Don't you think we should have a little more time just to get to know each other a little.
It's this way... AND THEY TAKE OFF AGAIN, PAIRING OFF
Well so what's the problem, you just put some newspaper down.
Well she apologized, and then she wanted to know if we could get together Wednesday afternoon.
I know a little. Besides, what do you have to know?
Alright, let's just examine the situation for a second. Who, in this situation, would be more likely to make a mistake? Me, who had access to my wallet, knew exactly what was in there? Or you--
That's a tough minute. It's like waiting in the shower for the conditioner to work.
Yeah, I do that too. I feel guilty about getting the pleasure. I feel like I don't deserve it so I talk. It stops me from enjoying it. There's nothing to eat in here.
She thinks I'm a nice guy. Women always think I'm nice, but women don'tnice.
No. Why must it be so difficult? Why is there all this tension and hostility? Why can't I just walk up to a woman on the street and say, "Hi. I'm
I gotta go back to the library and talk to him. I gotta find out if I&Mac226;m the guy who ruined his life.
Lupe. That's very nice, very nice. Listen, are you going to be making up the bed in the morning?
Yeah, well I uh got lots of other stuff to show you too. Wait till you see the plum job that I landed.
Huh-ho! Oh! You are too much, Mr. Kruger! Too much!
I have to rewind it first. (George presses the rewind button on the tape recorder. He and Jerry stand there, waiting impatiently as it rewinds.) Alright, alright.
What I don't get is, just because the battery is dead, you think she'd be able to roll up the hill with her hands!
(after waitress walks away) I don't believe it, she did it again!
I think Im getting tired of it. I mean is that all it does? Hello? La-la-la?
Kramer, what are you talking about...Janet doesn't look anything like Jerry
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. All right. I don't think we're gonna have any problem with that. (chuckles nervously) Good talking to you Tom. Really.
Yes! Yes! Everybody has to like me. I must be liked!
Yeah, good luck. Hey I'll meet you outside.
Oh, my God, No, oh my God, . . . Jerry!
(spotting possible salvation) You know what, I urge you to take it up with him. Go ahead, give him a call, he'll tell you what I'm doing here. (half to himself) Then you can tell me.
That's where the Seinfeld's are moving. They got a great deal. Yep. You know what they got in Florida? Jai-Alai! You bet on the games, you clean up.
Jerry? I have to tell you something. This is the dullest moment Ive ever experienced.
My cousin worked for Bouchard's. They used to use the bouilla-base for a toilet. (Jerry and Russell are shocked.)
I love this place. You know, Carl and I come here all the time.
(grunting) Hey! Hey, wait a second. I got an idea.
So I saw that new movie about the Hindenburg.
When do you ever have ten car lengths?
*I* think that *you* think that a certain *something* is not all that it could be, when in fact it is is all that it *should* be, and *more*!
Uh, yeah, I'll be there in a minute.
I wanna know what I did to this woman.
Alright, alright, I'll call Heather, you'll get your hat back, I will get a second date. Ha ha ha. Now watch the magic.
I like to stop at the duty free shop.
No, no, this is supposed to go to Joe Mayo's apartment.
Who are you to play God!? Every man's time comes! If his number is up, who are you to interfere!?
I take an eye test; I flunk it, the next thing you know I am swinging to the sweet sounds of risk management.
(Trying to keep it down) Because I like this one! (Notices people staring at him, he quickly gets up, collecting the his coat and the tiny replica) C'mon, let's go. Let's go! (On his way out, he stops in front of a woman blocking his path) Oh, hi.. (Embarrassed about the doll, he sheepishly walks out)
Listen, Buck, I uh...obviously I don't need to talk to you about the importance of player morale, but uh...I've been talking to some of the guys, and some of them - I don't want to mention any names - but some of them...they're not too happy with the polyester uniforms.
I'm going out with her tomorrow, she said she had some errands to run.
I'll leave when the guy comes in. I gotta tell you, I am loving this yada yada thing. You know, I can cross over my whole life story. (Picks up dental tool)
Who gets picked off in softball? Its unheard of.
The prop comic? (Ronnie holds up his water gun and smiles.) Oh, hi...I didn't recognize you, what...did you get a haircut?
Okay, what about a nice frame? With a picture of another guy in it. Frame says I care for you, but if you wanna get serious, perhaps you'd be interested in someone like this.
Well you know there is an unusual number of people in this country having sex with AMPUTEES! (grabs the forum from Kramer and walks over to the clerk) . . . Penthouse forum, newspaper, gum, Clark Bar.
Because my parents happen to be two pretty wonderful people.
(con't) All right, you know she's got that laugh. What did you say? It's like Elmer Fudd sitting on a juicer?
Alright, alright! (Goes out onto the sidewalk. The Seinfelds walk by) Seinfelds!
I still have it. The collar's okay. I wear it under sweaters.
(Showing Jerry up) Listen carefully. My mother has never laughed. Ever. Not a giggle, not a chuckle, not a tee-hee.. never went 'Ha!'
It was more like a full bodied dry heave set to music.
He might as well have! I caught him, and his face was covered in chocolate and cookie crumbs.
Hey, what's another million, give or take. I get off where and when I wanna get off.
(on an imaginary microphone) Uh, no, not at this time.
You know, Ive been thinking. I cannot envision any circumstances in which Ill ever have the opportunity to have sex again. Hows it gonna happen? I just dont see how it could occur.
(still in Jacks voice) I'm working on my Jack Nicholson, You can't handle the truth! (he salutes)
You know, sometimes those guys don't make it back. (Looks in fridge) I'm really hungry.
I have mourned for three long months! Summer months, too! Anybody could grieve in January! It's time for George to start being George again.
You're my mother! What wouldn't I do for you?
Uh huh. Uh huh! I think you spoke to your little friend Rachel, that's what I think.
Nah, I gotta deliver some Christmas presents to my parents.
(Getting up) You know what? Maybe I should take off.
(claps hands triumphantly) We might have an 'it'!
Yeah, eighty-three. Used to belong to John Voight.
You know, they say ostrich has less fat, but you eat more of it.
It's stuck on a piece of cloth here. I can't get the cloth out.
Yeah, and now someone's going to be taking messages for me.
No, he doesn't know O'Brien, if he knew O'Brien he wouldn't have a sign. Let's just do it.
Yeah. Hey, wait a second, you know, good news for you too. Susan's best friend, Hallie? Broke up with her boyfriend.
I had to listen to a five minute discussion on which one is actually called shmoopy.
Y'know, the funny thing is, somehow I find her more appealing now... It's like if I knew she was a lesbian when we went out, I never would've broken up with her.
(Still holding the note) I think I'm having a heart attack.
(on the answering machine) Jerry, what's happening? Come on, pick up the phone.
Ah ha, Ah ha. You would, wouldn't you?
Nah, with crutches it's a funny story, with a cane it's a sad story. You through with those?
(on the answering machine) Jerry, it's George. Hey, hey are you all set for the weekend. This is going to be great. You're going to have a great time with Naomi.
I've got to tell you, I'm really disappointed in Lupe.
Of course not. You don't care what I look like.
She said "sweep together" you idiots, not "sleep together."
I wasn't going to say anything, but then I could see that he wasn't going to open his mouth. (Chuckles)
I know. I just sort of leaned on it so it would look like it was mine.
It's a very complicated move! I couldn't remember it all.
Y'know the average life span for an American male is like, 72. You're really... kinda pushin' the envelope there.
I'm George. George Costanza, you live around here?
Anyway it's kind of a fluke thing but uh I'll be leaving for Paris in two days. I will send you a postcard when I get there.
Kramer, hey, hey! (Gets up out of his seat)
You know, I can't remember the last time I called a woman without being nervous. I, usually, I'm pacing all over the room, I'm...
Well it's not up my alley! It's one thing if I make it up. I know what I'm doin, I know my alleys! You got me in the Galapagos Islands livin' with the turtles, I don't know where the hell I am.
I was trying to stick the landing. (indistinct) ...was right around here.
I'm not gonna be nice. That's how I got the job.
Do you uh feel the way you feel after the Risotto?
Aw, well, you know, it's your anniversary. It's - it's the least I can do. I - I just want you guys to go out and have a good time. Ha ha. So, you think we should, uh, we should get downstairs?
Ohh.. Paco! (Flicks rubber band tward the kitchen) Hey, take a look at this. (Hands Jerry Kruger's check)
Elaine, this pilot...it doesn't matter to me, it's not me I'm concerned about...it's my mother. I've been over to the hospital to see her...
Oh, it's gotta be fifty! Hee hee! You know how much Ted Danson makes, huh?
What the hell is this? George, Elaine and I went to see Chunnel ... with Jerry. With Jerry, huh? With Jerry! Great. Great! (dials phone) Probably went to the 84th St. That's where I always go with Jerry.
I don't know, she said she had to pick up a friend of hers at the airport. It cost me a hundred dollars this ticket.
Wait a second, wait a second...and then the butler says, "I'm not cleanin' it up! I'm sick of cleaning!"
That's okay. That's good. You think Louie Pasteur and his wife had anything in common? He was in the fields all day with the cows, you know with the milk, examining the milk, delving into milk, consummed with milk. Pasteurization, Homogenization, She was in the kitchen killing cockroaches with a boot on each hand.
All right, let's--let's focus. Can we get back to the plan?
Well, it doesn't even have to be the general manager. Maybe I could be like, an announcer. Like a color man. You know how I always make those interesting comments during the game.
Alrighty, so. That's one tuck and one no-tuck. Got that?
I was doing standup comedy in Kennebunkport Maine. ??? night club. The stage was on a cliff and the audience was throwing all the comics off.
No, no, I mean, driving Susan to lesbianism.
Well perhaps, not to the extent that you are. But I know the basic plot. Yeah.
Well it's tough to get a good read but I think if I brought him a chair, he'd sit.
Just dropped in for a visit. You, uh, you never called me back.
There was a box of raisins on the coffee table. Did you, by any chance, take them with you when left?
Hey check this out. I go to pick up my pictures and she says " I hope you got that mustard stain out of your shirt."
Oh, no no no, I'm fine. Let me help you with these dishes, huh?
Mrs. Sweedler thank you. Y-You see, this tragedy affected me in a very, very personal way.
(picking up his coat) Awright, I'm heading home.
So, she's the loser of the group. Every group has someone that they all make fun of.. Like us with Elaine. (Jerry thinks about this, then shakes it off)
So go ahead pigeons. hu hu hu. Laugh it up. I'm getting in my car now and the last I heard ... we have NO DEAL!
I left three messages. I can't believe this woman. She has sex with me, leaves ten minutes later then I never hear from her again. What kind of a person does this? I mean, she used me. I feel cheap and violated.
Because I kissed her in the meeting. Russell found out, he fired her over the phone. Finally, my stupidity pays off!
Oh, thats great. Thats great. By the way I have to apologize for my friend the other day. Friend? Uh, uh I dont even know that woman. I met her on the bus on the way over. I couldnt get rid of her. Uh, My psychic instincts were a little off ..
I can do hard time for this one. And community service!
Oh, yeah? Holistic.. that's what I need. That's the answer.
I've been to a few of em. If you uh start to get woozy later, which is quite common, stay close to me. I'll get you through it. (chuckles)
I can't go anywhere, I have to wait here for Tatiana's call. Let me just check.
Yeah, sure, we met at Jerry Seinfeld's apartment. When you fumigated for fleas over there.
Oh, o.k., yeah. Where am I gonna park here...? (Pulls over.)
Whew! Boy, it's cold outside, huh? Oh, these New York winters, huh. Bitter cold, bitter.
Still lookin'. It's pretty bad out there. What about you?
(to Jerry) You watch the old videos. (insistent) I'm telling you, look at him.
It's beautiful. She makes all the plans. I'm not from around here so it's okay if I'm stupid, and she knows I'm only in town visiting so there's no messy breakup
Snoopy and Prickly Pete. Should I keep driving?
Excuse me, darling, do I detect a Portuguese accent?
Im starving. You got any of those free donuts you use to soften people up?
I bought a new recliner with a fridge build right in to it.
I was just wondering what it was you wanted for dessert.
What happens to charter tickets when you don't use em?
I didn't do it! It..It just got done. I don't know how it got done, but it did.
(not happy delivering Elaine's lie) Well, he uh, he wants to uh, quit the exporting and uh, focus just on the importing. And it's a problem, because she thinks the exporting is as important as the importing.
I knew it!! (shuts cab door) I predicted it! (hits cab roof twice, it drives off) Saw both of them today! What a disaster! I'm runnin' all over Queens. First I saw my mother. We had lunch together. Never had... LUNCH with my mother before--it's like a date! Then we drive down to Kew Gardens! Tons of traffic! I see my father. We played "Clue"! All day with this! [Kew Gardens (see links at end of script)]
Wait a minute. This looks familiar. This reminds me of something. I can do this.
Okay. "Breakfast At Tiffany's." (Begins to read, but gradually his attention is drawn to the TV Guide on the end table. George realizes there's a show on he wants to see by looking at his watch, and doesn't start the book.)
Yeah, right. I'll just go up and say, "Hi, how ya' doing? Would you like a glass of white wine?" JERRY Before you got within twenty feet of this woman, she'd have her finger on the mace button. She's like an expensive car with one of those motion-sensor force field alarms. Any sudden movement in the area could set her off.
(sets down his paper) So how were the eggs?
I got another meeting with Reilly. A whole new audience, and I bet I can get him to try that line again.
You want to be with somebody that doesn't like you.
I dont know. All of em. Theyre all crooks! Besides, I couldnt get all different candy bars, anyway.
Quick. Get this thing back in the pizzeria
Anyway, I think everything else is okay. Unless of course she's faking.
Me run in? Why don't you run in?
Yeah my parents have it. Sometimes it skips a generation.
You think she liked me? She seemed to like me.
Kramer! You can't go! Who's gonna do the feats of strength?
I can't be blind, Jerry The blind are courageous.
Na no, I'm not good in these situations. I can't hide my pity. I..I make em feel worse.
Yeah, now I gotcha! (hangs up the phone and rushes out the door)
Let me be the architect! I can do it!
Well no not yet, you gotta buy french stamps (pauses) I-I'll reimburse you of course.
(disbelief) What?! They're stealing the name?! That's my name, I made it up!
Ya and also I'm afraid that people in that state are finally going to tell me what they really think of me. You know they got nothing to lose what do they care?
My card won't work there; they're not on the Plus system.
Yeah. I think we really go something here.
Yeah, you gotta do it classy (wipes his mouth to his sweater.)
Maybe somebody did it and didn't take credit for it. Maybe it was already done and didn't need doing in the first place. I have no idea who did it, what they did, or how they did it so well. And you know what? Jimmy crack corn and I don't care.
(to Jerry, as Jerry nods in agreement) You know I think she might have something there.
Well if you and I ever got into, like a really serious fight you know, and the punches started flying -- who do you think would win?
What the hell are you two talking about? (All exit)
(breaks a long silence) The uh, the shoe laces that you bought me, they uh, they worked out well. (thumbs up)
Yeah, yeah, sure, Christmas. Snow. Santa. All that stuff.
Oh, Rita. Hey, Mr. Shermack, how're you doing, good to see you. Jay, always a pleasure. (To Susan) Sweetie. (Kisses her and then sits down next to Jerry) Yeah, yeah, that butler idea, that's beautiful. Isn't that killer? (Aside to Jerry) I thought I was getting the butler.
Yes, hello. Party's over. (taking off the suit)
Well I'm sure you have secrets from me. I don't know anything about your cycles.
(to Susan's stone) ...And then, right after the All-Star Break, we, we just swept the Orioles. Four games. In Baltimore. (adjusts necktie nervously) So... yeah.
(quieter desperation) They took my belt, Jerry. I got nothing to hold my pants up. (listens) Well, you gotta come over here now! Just tell 'em what we talked about, how I, how I, I didn't do the project.
You can't handle the truth! (he salutes) (imitating Jack Nicholson [a.k.a. Col. Nathan R. Jessep], from the 1992 movie A Few Good Men)
No, no, no, this suit is not for sale. (tries to take off the suit from the guy)
Ah, and I got a date with the sales woman. She's got a little Marisa Tomei thing going on.
He's got a gun! He's got a gun! Get out of the way! (Tries to flee the bar in a mad panic. The audience in the club also goes nuts and heads for the exits. Jerry stands onstage, perplexed.)
What, what happened? Where's, where's all the stuff?
The only thing that bothers me is that I'm just coming up with this now.
Oh, well, uh. Gary told me you said hi.
What about the dolphins? You could swim with the dolphins down there.
I don't need any ideas. It's a show about nothing.
My parents. It's their anniversary. I'm taking them out to dinner and a show tonight. You think we'll hit traffic?
(Places the doll presumingly where it belongs on a shelf) Ya?
A preemptive breakup. This is an incredible idea. I got nothing to lose. We either break up which she would do anyway but at least I go out with some Dignity. Completely turn the tables. It's absolutely brilliant.
I always get myself in this position. Can't be on time. Gotta rush.
So all right I'll speak to you through Jerry and everything.
Ade, you're a wonder. (he he -- george laughs)
(thinking to himself) Oh my god, there she is. That's the face, just like the picture.
(light) No. No, no, no. The cushion was turned over.
I told I had a bus transfer that was only good just for another hour.
Well, Dr, Allenwood, uh...I was hoping to compile an - admittedly, rudimentary - scrapbook of her life. Something that Betsy could have, and hold onto.
No, no. Deena, it's not what you think.
Oh! Here you are. Ha ha...You, uh, you want to--
Not as good. That's when you realize all the money you're losing.
What? Every time I leave my house now I have to call everybody I know and ask them if they want to do what I'm doing?
Why shave every day? It just grows right back.
(examining reflection) I really think this looks pretty good.
I dont know, I cant eat. You, you cant have anything anymore. Look at this, look at this. Eggs out. Coffee out. French fries out. BLT out! I go to visit my grandparents three big brisket sandwiches, Im sittin here with a carrot! Theyre closing in on a hundred, Im sayin to them, How can you eat that stuff? (They look at their menus again.) Im so sick about losin that choose, you dont know.
More wine and turkey? (Pours Celia more wine)
I am such a Huge whale fan. These marine biologists were showin' how they communicate with each other with these squeaks and squeals, what a fish!
Excuse me, are you going to be much longer? I have to make a very important call.
(confessing) Well, actually, I thought it up on the way over here.
Well, my father works for the United Volunteers, maybe he can get her one.
Would I want to see what Mary Todd wore to Lincoln's funeral?
Whatever. (George looks to the table) Hey new tape recorder?
No, but um I have very good report with women, very good, comfortable. And from the first time I laid eyes on a brassieres, I was enthralled.
And the amazing thing is she eats like there's no tomorra'. I mean I've never seen an appetite like this. Desserts. Everything. I don't know how she does it.
Maybe she wasn't! Maybe she heard the whole conversation!
I'm sure he'll be back in a second.
My tonsils? Yeah, when I was a kid.
Yes, yes of course. The Pensky file. Ho ho, can't wait to sink my teeth into that. Wow that Pensky. Well we'll straighten him out.
Yeah. Got to invite The Drake. Listen hem...there's something that's been on my mind and we haven't really talked about it..I t's kind of important to me.
Are you looking deep down at the real person underneath?
Yeah, it's bizarre. (they both look around them suspiciously)
Handicap? (gesturing to his cane) Oh, I'm not handicapped.
Maybe I could move them until you get back.
Do you think it might be possible to add a little shelf like, uh, for an alarm clock?
(running out and away from the van) I knew it wasn't Berkowitz!
She's not there. She left. She must've waited and left because those people wouldn't get off the phone.
Nevertheless.. I was wondering if you and your .friends are doing business here at the Jiffy Park.... You know ..hum What do you people call it? Turning tricks? Anyway I...I....found a condom in my car....and I'm not saying it's yours but.... I want to know if I should just change parking lots.
I figured you'd cruise. At least through the Spring.
All righty, no reason for us to uh, raise our voices.
I guess she did. He's gone, now I'm the man.
Hey, so, did you give that radio the old switcheroo?
Well, I like to stay in touch with the people.
Everybody likes pesto. You walk into a restaurant, that's all you hear - pesto, pesto, pesto.
This guy from my old neighborhood. Lloyd Braun. He's a big advisor to Mayor Dinkins. He thinks he's so cool.
A backup system? We're designing bathroom doors with our legs exposed in anticipation of the locks not working? That's not a system. That's a complete breakdown of the system.
Pack of gum. Here you go. (hands the clerk a $100 bill)
Then, why? Why did you make me drive all the way out here? Why didn't you say something? Why? Why? Why?
Besides, Steven Koren has the highest of aspirations. He wants to be (pauses for effect) an architect.
A fan? I would drape myself in velvet if it were socially acceptable. And look at this, hardwood floors!
You know what I never understood? Why did they change the siren noise? When I was a kid it was always "waaaa, waaaa", you know now it "woo-woo-woo-woo-woo". Why did they do that, did they do some research? Did they find that woo-woo was more effective than waa?
No they don't. I tried that once. I snubbed for a year. Nothing. Every woman I saw, I snubbed. You never saw people so pleased. (Elaine returns from the bathroom.)
King Edward. (snapping his fingers) King Edward, Jerry.
Reprogram all the buttons, see if he changes them back. You know? The old switcheroo.
(smitten) Audrey? My god, you look incredible! I can't believe it!
I tell ya, I hear people really stuff themselves on those cruise ships. (Laughs) The buffet, that's the real ordeal, huh, Clarence? (Laughs)
I don't like it, it's red. It it's too flashy.
I dont know. But I dont. Im actually almost happy to hear it.
(In a really strange way) Good, good, do that.
I can't sell the book. It's been marked.
Well just take an overview. Can't you just take an overview?
Do you realize in the entire history of western civilization no one has successfully accomplished the Roommate Switch? In the Middle Ages you could get locked up for even suggesting it!
What are you doing here, I though you were going to the airport.
Aw, hoh, oh Deena, thank God. (he hugs Deena) Thank God you're here. Listen, you gotta help me. You gotta tell these people that I'm okay. You know that I don't belong in here.
What if he's waiting for me outside? He pointed at me! Did you see him point?!
You wanna see?! (pulling off the hat to reveal the bald pate) There! There it is! (turning to Newman) Alright, here! You wanna try on the hat?! Here! Try on the hat!
Uhm...Id like to ask you...ask you to analyze a hypothetical phone call, you know, from a female point of view.
I was squinting! Remember that drive from Wortsborough? (snapping his fingers) I was spotting those raccoons.
(anger) Well now it's not gonna be original! It's gonna lose all its cachet!
I think things were going ok. We were having a nice conversation.
Hey! (to Elaine, who doesn't look too cheerful)
I had nothing to do wtih any of this! I met all her friends, I didnt want to meet them. I kept trying to avoid it. I knew it would only get me in deeper. But they were everywhere! They kept popping up all over the place. This is Nancy, this is Susan, this is Amy, this is my cousin, this is my brother, this is my father... Its like Im in quicksand.
Kramer, I cant believe it. Oh, youre my hero!
I am not putting it in a garage, it's my space.
Oh, this is all locking in now. It is all locking in! (laughing)
Hey. I've kept the same job for more than two years. It's not luck. Elaine, have you ever sent a racy photograph of yourself to anyone?
Well, he has to play! He can't just not play. We're playing! Look, I gotta see him, how do I get in touch with him?
Who's dressing you? (Laughs) You look like a complete idiot! You know, I wouldn't wipe my- (Unable to take anymore, Leslie gets up and shoves George violently. His hands go straight for the hot iron sitting on the dressing room table. George screams out in agony) AAHHHH!!!!! (his voice is heard outside the building, on the street, and in the park were a bunch of pigeons are scared by the yelling)
(to Jerry) What do you mean by that?
(knocks on the window) Hey, why are all those people milling around my car?
They got a new intern from Francis Louis High. His name is Keith. He comes in Mondays after school.
(Walks off) I got a lot of thinking to do.
What are you gonna do with all of them?
There's nothing I can even impart to you, that's the sad thing. It's so inborn, I can't pass it on. (begins backing into the space) Look at this guy. Are you crazy, what are you doing?! Hey! Hey, you're stealing my space!
I have nothing to say to anybody. I'm so uninteresting. I think I'm out of conversation.
Well, I think you're wrong about that. [Elaine walks past the window again, glancing in] And ah now if you'll excuse me, I'd really like to get started, please.
(Definite) I'll take it in my room. (Walks off)
You can't break up with me. I've got hand.
Mind? Why would I mind? I would love to wait! (shakes hands with Nana) Nana, nice to see you. Ni-ni-ni-ni-NANA! (embraces another guest, kisses her) Aunt Phyllis, always a pleasure. What a pleasure! Hey, let's do this again real soon. I had fun, huh?
. We should be having dinner with our sons when we're sixty.
Man, would I like to see the look on his face.
All right, look. I'm getting the Chow Fung. You don't have to have any.
You can't do that, you can't just sneak in from the back like that.
Isn't that why we have locks on the doors?
(Munching on a hamburger) This Arbys is good.
I read somewhere that this Brentano's is the place to meet girls in New York.
(as the others are repositioning the tables) No, no, you can't do that, they're round, it makes an 'eight' and, yeah, well alright.
Anyway, I think the guy in the shower opposite saw me. He gave me a dirty look.
Apparently the Seinfelds' are too good for us. I shouldn't say anything bad about your uh your partner.
Oh!, so what. I'd rather she hate me and thought I was good looking....At least I can get somebody else. (scratching his chest) What is this? Why am I itching?
I gotta get to Fowler. I know that he would take this squirrel off my hands. It's practically bionic!
No, I-I-I know... [retreats back to his Chinese take out] I know...
What happens if the husband dies after the wife, who brings in the clothing in then?
(taking out wallet) Well, let me. Heh. Let me just eh.. check an', make sure I have the right man--ha! Heh, heh, heh! Seems--oh! I, oh! (has conveniently dropped the photo into her view)
Yeah.. (Trying to remember) Poverotti.. Domingo.. and.. uh.. the other guy.
...meet the Mets. Come on in and greet the Mets.
I know. And now they want me to bottle it up. It makes me so mad!
You should be the one criticizing me. I, I'm lucky to even know someone like you.
(emerging from bathroom, buttoning his shirt) A gymnast! I can't believe it, you didn't tell me she was a gymnast.
Hey! Uh--listen--did you get your--uh--boss's Knick ticket, for Kramer?
Well I think it would be nice if there was some kind of historical record of it.
$2? But everyone in front of me got free bread.
Oh yeeah.. well , Big smoker... I (coughs some more) gave it up for a while but it was too tough. Y' know.....I got no will power.
(In a state of hysteria) I'm an eggplant! I'm an eggplant! I'm a minstrel man!
Shhh! Listen, you gotta do me a favor. Give me your wallet. I'll give it back to you later.
kissed me. We both had tears streaming down our faces. I never saw anyone so beautiful. It was at that moment that I decided to tell her that, I was not a marine biologist.
Yeah, yeah, right here. (hands it to him)
Well let me hear....( they struggle for the headphones)
They're men with jobs, Jerry! They wear suits and ties. They're married, they have secretaries.
See? This looks right to you, doesn't it?
So we had a good time... the four of us.
You see if I stay the whole year, I get it all.
All right, if she puts the bags down before she greets you, thats a good sign.
You arms look like something hanging in a kosher deli.
(seeing his parents being intimate) Oh, my god!
No keys. And I been calling the city all day. Course there's not really a number to call if you wanna make a pothole.
And ah, Ill have the bacon club without the turkey. (raises eyebrows)
Like a "Hey your mother is uglier than Hazel. Hazel really puts your mother to shame"
This is it! It happened to me, Jerry! I was sitting in the restaurant, the two nut jobs were talking - I couldn't take it any more. I got up, and (Makes a noise) I bop into this woman..
I'm not giving you the satisfaction. I'm gonna watch it again...
we rode along all the way to the hospital
Lemme see this. (Tries to grab the papers.)
(Putting his hands up) Alright, alright, hold on! (Jerry has George's full attention) Time out! Woah, woah! (Scooting in, giddy) What did she say?
How could she leave us alone with this lunatic? Ten more minutes, and thats it! Im leaving. I have to tell you, this guy scares me.
Don't jinx it! Don't jinx (trails off quietly in elation)
And then I hear this rabbi on television, I mean imagine.
Would you stop that? It's not safe to be jumping up and down on a plane.
I just remembered, I gotta be someplace. Yuh-hu-hur, that's enough. Pop. Pop, put down the wrench, Pop.
Sorry, we're a little late. We got so hung up in traffic.
Ah, see, Mister.. I didn't write that report. That, that's not mine.
Youre doomed. Youre gonna have to have all your sex at womens apartments. Itll be like a permanent road trip. Forget about the home bed advantage.
No, occasionally I'll forget to let the machine pick up. Anyway, they made this large donation, to a women's prison, and I get to go down there and check it out.
Look, why couldn't you make me an architect? You know I always wanted to pretend that I was an architect. Well I-I'm supposed to see her tomorrow, I-I-I'm gonna tell her what's goin on. I mean maybe she just likes me for me.
Jerry, a throat-clear is a non-verbal implication of doubt - he thinks I killed Susan!
No, that's a fair question. It is, uhm... (nervous chuckle) Jerry, yeah. (to Cynthia) Jerry's a friend of mine. (to Russell) He uh, he gave it to me. Unbelievable how many addresses of people this guy has.
No, no, no. Just lately, I've been thinking a lot clearer. Like this afternoon, (To television) what is chicken Kiev, (Back to Jerry) I really enjoyed watching a documentary with Louise.
I--I've been, walkin' around all night.. I've been thinkin' about Allison and me.. an' you--
Would you excuse us for a minute Tim boy, we're kind of in the middle of something.
Yes, I like to just be able to take the blankets and swish them and swirl them, you know what I mean? You know, I don't like being all tucked in. I like to have a lot of room, you know I like to have my toes pointed up in the air. Just like to scrunch up the blankets.
Because I'm a cheater! I had to tell you.
All right. (throws his coat back down on the seat and sits down opposite them)
Maybe I need someone who doesn't speak English.
Hey by the way my parents really want to have your parents over dinner before they leave town.
This woman left this really sexy message on Jerry's tape recorder......
I believe that I am about to become the target of a systematic process of intimidation and manipulation, the likes of which you have never -
So, that's it. All of my darkest fears, and... everything I'm capable of. That's me.
I don't understand lunch, I don't know anything about lunch. Listen. Just because I got the guy fired doesn't mean I turned him into a bum - does it?
You put a hot tub... in your living room?
"Yeah,yeah yeah yeah! I've seen these.....they sorta ..they make your legs..stronger."
(pause) Dad! I heard you were in the city the other day!
Demi (the "i" sounds like an "e")? I thought it was Demi?
(answering the phone while walking away) Joe Mayo's apartment?
(frustrated) Ohh, I wanted to see that. (waves his arms in frustration) Thanks. Thanks a lot.
Oh my god, maybe Gwen saw it. Maybe that's what did it.
Elaine, of course I'm concerned. I'm payin' for those meals. It's like throwing money down the toilet.
I'm baby-sitting! Vivian asked me to raise him if she doesn't make it.
Whatever!!. . . . Oh oh oh this is unbelievable. This is better than my bed at home.
(still quiet) Think, a second. You know, your friend was talking about me and, you know...
You wanted a Yankee, I got you a Yankee.
Alright, alright, I'll go on the date, but that's that.
Alright, fine.I'll drive the 3 hours each way, 6 hours all together, and take 'em off myself!!
I see, well, thats open to interpretation. Because so much depends on the layering and the quality of the wetness in the eyes.
We are really late now. We're in big trouble. Big trouble.
So he walks out of the stall, he's been talking the whole time.
Eh, they're trying to pick out a new couch - you don't want to know. (Remembering the watching Van Buren Boys) Give me your wallet, or I'll spill your guts right here on the street!
You open the door to the car, boom, you walk right into the hospital. Eh, You can't beat that spot. (starts doing a little dance) I am on a roll. I'm just willing these great parking spots.
How would you find out something like that...wait a minute, what am I thinking? I've got the entire Yankee organization at my disposal.
(Still mad a Leslie) Never said goodbye. Goodbye!
I know. I cut the button off and poked a hole with a letter opener.
Oh, that's too bad. I kinda wanted to meet him, seeing as how we look so similar.
(Not really wanting to embellish) ..I stopped by the house to drop the car off, and I went inside for a few minutes.. Nobody was there - they're supposed to be working. (Jerry and Elaine look at each other - enjoying the story) My mother had a Glamour magazine, I started leafing through it..
Jerry, let's face it, I've always been handicapped. I'm just now getting the recognition for it. Name one thing I have that puts me in a position of advantage. Huh? There was a guy that worked at the Yankees-- no arms! He got more work done than I did, made more money, had a wife, a family, drove a better car than I did.
What's he going to do? That's exactly the point. Nobody knows what this guy is capable of! He fires people like it is a bodily function.
At the funeral, give or take. You know, deep down, I always kinda felt that they blamed me for Susan's death.
I said 'God bless you'. Was that so wrong?
That?s not the issue, we're friends, if I?ve got to be uncomfortable, you've got to be uncomfortable too!
Which market, the, eh, big one, the big market, the big board. Bull market, bear market, you name the market, I'm there.
(Frantically) Did anybody call here asking for Vandelay industries?
(Vowing) Well, I'll tell you this, though - I am never doing.. that , again.
Didn't say anything. (They go into Elaine's apartment.)
Oh, I think it is! I think that's exactly what it is!
All right, Dad, we're five blocks from the house. Sit sideways.
(jubilant) Five thousand dollars? She doesnt have five thousand dollars!
I like, uh...(mutters something unintelligible under his breath.)
Um, all right, um, uh, I'll call 'ya. I'll call you and we'll talk on the phone. A telephone communiqu. Every thing is fine ok, uh, fine, .. [exits]
51 people?! That's it?! I thought it was, like, a thousand!
Well, maybe they're done with it. I could go pick it up.
me too, I am down, I am totally down, mark me down
I know Jerry. He has this phobia about public toilets. I think we really should go upstairs.
Puddys just gonna give you the car, huh? (Skeptically) Youll see. First they stick you with the undercoating, rust-proofing, dealer prep. Suddenly, youre on your back like a turtle.
So she's just sitting there, she's having a pleasant conversation... and all of a sudden.
Jerry, it's me, George, don't worry, I'll return it
And then in the fifth inning, why did you take off on the pop fly?
Oh, boy I was up to four in the morning watching the Omen trilogy.
Elaine and her sponges...she's got like, a war chest full of them.
(panicked and rushed) Jerry! The Japanese guys had sake in the hot-tub! You gotta get 'em outta the drawers and get 'em down here, or I don't have a focus group to sell the pilot to Japanese TV!
Regardless. I had to walk around for the rest of the party in some cheap Metlife windbreaker. Now, it is payback time.
I mean he's a good fighter and a nice guy but I don't like him.
Jerry, can I talk to you for a second? (They enter Jerry's apartment)
So, you... you say you've been in the city all winter?
I though we said we weren't going to discuss that now!
Fine. (hits his arm on the desk) Ow!
Okay, okay. Look, you do all the talking, okay?
So you don't think she really has a boyfriend?
No, I don't know who was doing that.
Oh, I don't think you want to do that.
(urgent) Move a pinkie, if it's yes. Can you move a pinkie?
I don't know where you're getting this from. I....you're serious aren't you? Oh, (laughing) you see? You see, you just don't know my sense of humor. Dan, don't I joke around all the time?
If I could talk to the guy for just a sec...
I like to stop at the duty free shop!
All right there you go. It's a '47 cabin all right. So, we'll see you tomorrow.
There he is. Right on time as usual.
Who cares about eyebrows? Is she sweet? I like sweet. But not too sweet, you could throw up from that.
The whole hour just flew by. (laughs - hehe) (Begins cleaning up the table.)
Yes, I will do the opposite. I used to sit here and do nothing, and regret it for the rest of the day, so now I will do the opposite, and I will do something!
I'm gonna go with you. I gotta get a new suit. I got a second interview with MacKenzie, and I think I'm really close. They're all taking me out to lunch on Friday.
Well what if I told you I'm thinking of moving here?
I was moving it across the street, I looked up and I saw Woody Allen and I got all distracted.
Hey, don't embarrass me today. I got some friends in the stands. (George makes a swinging motion with an imaginary bat and pulls something in his back.)
You wanna sell computers? I will show *you* how to sell computers! Hello, Mr. Farneman. You wanna buy a computer? No? Why not? All right, I see! Good answer! Thank you! (Lloyd rings his sale bell) Serenity now!
You can go crazy trying to figure that place out.
And she didn't say something to you about a certain something?
(Changing subject) Hey, I htink I may have found someone for the scholarship.
Well, that pear shaped loser was me! And I was in that photo, until I broke in here, stole the photograph and airbrushed myself out of there!
Ya gotta put on a show, ya always gotta give them a big show. You always have to be 'on' otherwise why would they like me? They'd just go for a better looking guy with more money.
Hey, Ring Dings are better than anything you're gonna get at a bakery.
First time in my life I've ever gotten back at someone.
Yes a cruise, a long cruise, just the two of you.
So, if Susan and I had... I mean, if the envelopes hadn't, uh... then we--
You met her at the supermarket? How did you do that?
Oh, yeah, sure, accident, right. She was aiming right at me like she was putting out a fire! Then, for the rest of the show, I'm sitting there with chocolate all over my shirt. Flies are landing on me. I'm boiling - I'm fantasizing all the things I'm gonna say when I see her. And later, finally, backstage when I talk to her, I'm a groveling worm. "What kind of chocolate was that? Do you throw any other foods?"
Well, this is a lovely apartment. Lovely! My kids are gonna go crazy. I, uh, I wonder if I could see the bathrooms. Preferably one with some paint thinner and, uh, some rags?
Excuse me, the guy is wearing a jacket that my friend is...
Well what would I say in the note?
(Aggravated) Well, I got screwed on the donuts. There were none left. Heh!
Okay. Now, why do I have to see (points) you?
You know, Jason, I, uh, I couldn't help notice, I... I didn't get my apology.
Susan B. Anthony** I think I'd have a problem with.
Excuse me, I'm sorry to bother you, I noticed that you have a textbook on tape. May I ask where you got that?
How come you don't know what street are you on?
No, no. I-I just want us to be... together.
Hey, is it my imagination, or do really good looking women walk a lot faster than everybody else?
(continuing) I feel like a family. In fact, yesterday was Grace's birthday. She's such a sweet woman so, we had a little party, with cake and champagne. I made a toast.
It's not a pet! It's a wild invalid! And it knows that I tried to kill it. As soon as it gets better, it's gonna gnaw my brain out in my sleep!
You know what I would like to do? I would really like to have sex with a tall woman. I mean really tall. Like a like a giant Like six five.
Because I'm REFRESHED. I finally found a way to sleep in my office. Under the desk. I lie on my back. I tuck in the chair. I'm invisible.
(entering) Last night, huh? Was that something, or was that something?
People always leave old things in their medicine cabinet.
Well, she doesn't really want to see Firestorm.
Well, it's a good looking piece of meat. (laughs nervously) Wow, this is some place. A duplex, huh? (indicating) Look at this, you got stairs in an apartment. All my life, I dreamed about having steps in an apartment. Even one step. Sunken living room. Although, one step is really not all that sunken. (tries hard to elicit a laugh)
I can do six weeks standin' on my head. I'm a sexual camel. That's not the point. At least there was the possibility.
Pretend you didn't know it was there. Can you see it?
So let me ask you a question about the tip jar. I had a little thing with the calzone guy this week. I go to drop a buck in the tip jar and just as I am about to drop it in he looks the other way. And then when I am leaving he gives me this look think thanks for nothing. I mean if they don't notice it what's the point.
Yeah, yeah. You gotta come over tonight. We can play.
I should've hit the little son-of-a-bitch. I can't stand kids. Adults think it's so wonderful how honest kids are. I don't need that kind of honesty. I'll take a deceptive adult over an honest kid any day.
I noticed you eh, chose the eh "clowns with balloons" check design.
It's "Guys And *Dolls*", not "Guys And *Guys*".
Do you ever just get down on your knees and thank god that you know me and have access to my dementia?
Yeah, and, ... Why won't this go down?
Yeah well, they won't know. I got the car there.
I heard what you said "Sharon, are you there?".
Yeahaha, I gave it a shot (pats Jerry on the arm)... So, any word on the "artiste"? (puts a video in the VCR)
I told you to stop with the hopping.
Yeah, what do you do when you run out of laundry?
(trying to laugh it off) No, I was just wondering. The information could be relevant.
When you're playing the piano do you think about me?
What is that, Boyfriend? I don't understand that. What, what does she think I asked her out for?
I already bought it! I've been lyin' to you for three days, and now you're all screwin' me!
My moneys all tied up in change right now.
We'll just take a check. (She leaves the check. George, in all his cheapness, can't help but to review the check. He finds an error) You made a mistake on the..
I'm really going to do something with these three months.
I'll tell ya, if I had one of these things, I'd be eatin' hot dogs all the time.
I don't know, I like stuff you don't have to think about too much.
Personally I'm a little nervous about going through these things. I'm afraid I'm gonna step through into another dimension.
You think it's contact? It has to be touched?
Well, it's all for charity, so what's the difference.
(worked up) I can't have a cup of coffee with a person?! I'm not allowed to have coffee?!
Can you believe he sold his glasses on the street?
Actually, (George flips the book back to the beginning) I'll take these nice glossy ones.
Why didn't you ask me? I know a million theater jokes. 'What's the deal with those guys down in the pit?'
Donna. Oh, youre the one that likes that commercial!
No, it's doing the same thing to someone that they did to you.
Well, I, I got the pilot of the Jerry show.
Did you feel that tension? We use to have banter - (puts menu back with frustration) - there's no more banter.
A man gave me... a massage. hu, hu
I used to share that same outlook. But now, I have so many things to occupy my mind. For instance, the atom.
You should see what my father used to go through before he bought a car. He'd go from state to state. He was away for weeks at a time. It was like he was running for President and he was going through the primaries. We'd get phone calls from motels in New Hampshire.
Men have been popping into my sexual fantasies. All of a sudden I'll be, in the middle.
I don't even know what they think. That's why I'm in therapy.
This is a crude mock-up of the conference room. 1/14th scale.
Let's go, people, let's go! It's Prognosis Negative time, wa ha ha ha!!!
I wouldn't hear of it, Todd. It's none of my business. But you should try to find out everything you possibly can. In fact, I'll even stay all the way on the other side of the room just so there's no chance of me overhearing anything.
I usually spend Saturday afternoons with Susan. She's gonna want to know what I'm doing. I can't use Jerry, he's in Florida.
No! My ticket?! You gave my ticket to Horneck?
What are you, Bud Abbott? What are you callin me an idiot?
Oh yeah, real cool. You're a cool guy.
They wish. I hate the big broker-houses. Hate them with a passion. Big broker-houses killed my father.
You got bit by a strange dog and you didn't get a rabies shot?
(to the saleswoman) You know honey for an unadvertised sale, you're doing a lot of yapping about it.
Well, it's not that. I just, you know, I thought that we were both uh...
Well, why don't *you* go, and I could save the seats. You said you didn't like saving anyway.
I guess I should be, but Im not.
I gotta prep. I need a couple of anecdotes, a few you-were-right-abouts. It's a whole procedure. Wasn't Fragile Frankie the one that used to run into the woods every time he got upset?
If you don't mind, sir. I'll be here at 8.
Now, this is the basic layout for Mario's Pizza.
You know, my arm feels a lot better. That Wendy really knows her stuff. (he writes out a cheque)
You said the guy gave you an open-lipped kiss!
Its amazing. We, we both have dates on the same night. I cant remember the last time that happened.
I got about fifty-feet out and suddenly, the great beast appeared before me. I tell ya he was ten stories high if he was a foot. As if sensing my presence he let out a great bellow. I said, "Easy big fella!" And then, as I watched him struggling I realized, that something was obstructing its breathing. From where I was standing I could see directly into the eye of the great fish!
Well I didn't know you wanted to go to the flea market.
All right. Well, we'll see what happens to you.
I'm just asking, all they have to do is say no.
Susan Davis? (Getting possessive) Hey, wait a second..
I was throwing up all night. It was like my own personal Crying Game.
So you think you can put the suit aside and hold it for me?
...but is there any way that I could possibly have Neil's phone number?
Shes an... etymologist. You know, bees, flies, gnats. W-What about you?
I was all primed for the first row; I was gonna put my feet up on the dugout!
(desperate) Steinbrenner had me committed! I'm in the nuthouse!
Ah, excuse me, Vice-president Coco, no one cares about your Gammy.
He's actually doing him a favor. It's less money for him to buy food.
Had to come in and maybe well get together? Had to and maybe?
So who am I to be thinking about someone's nose? I mean, I should be grateful someone like her even looks at me. I have no job, nothing. But I have to say, I think about the nose. I don't want to think about the nose. I don't ask to think about the nose, but I think about it. I go to bed at night, I tell myself, 'Don't think about the nose, forget the nose,' but I think about it. I look at her, I see nose.
It's a huge problem, Jerry. The hardest part about having sex with a woman is getting her to come back to your place! He's already got that.
So you thought she was good looking and figured this would be a good way to meet her.
I-I don't know. Last time I got the tap.
Well why couldn't you include me in your excuse?
No, he said there was nothing he could do, and next time I should probably break the Prozacs in half.
I guess you two are the lucky ones.
I don't think we should. We really don't know each other very well.
Ehh. (nostalgic) Remember that summer at Dairy Queen where I cooled my feet in the soft-serve machine?
Elaine, get off the speaker! (Elaine picks up phone)
Hey, I'm sorry, you had your buffer zone for many years. It's my turn to live, baby.
Hes a cube. Anyway, he got married six months ago. He told me ever since hes been wearing a wedding band, women have been coming on to him everywhere he goes.
Great! (snaps fingers and grabs the extra plane ticket) Nina could go, huh? Jerry, this is great. You and Elaine. Me and Nina.
So, we watching the movie, or are we still talking? (Joe's wife shakes her head and goes into the other room. George gestures to Remy to move.) Okay, c'mon. Let's go.
Alright, what are we getting? It's hot in here!
Let Maria Shriver give her a baby shower.
I don't think we should see each other anymore. You're great but I'm I'm riddled with personal problems.
Oh I think I'd go for the back.
Festivus, Sir. And, uh, I was afraid that I would be persecuted for my beliefs. They drove my family out of Bayside, Sir!
I still don't understand this. Abby has a mentor?
What I said? I say stupid things all the time I can't go two minutes without saying stupid things.
Hey, the Bull owes me one, I helped him with his swing.
Well, I gotta do somethin'. (Walks over to bathroom. Kramer enters)
Oh, nothin' much. I went over to jerry's, uh, talked to Jerry.
You don't need the cufflinks! You have the same name! (no reaction) 'Jerry'! (heads for door, grabbing his coat)
Then I asked her if she wanted a drink.
I don't know. (George sits down at the table. Kramer enters.)
Hmm-hmm, not by a long shot. I'm calling up the Rosses and inviting them up to my non-existent place in the Hamptons. Then we'll see who blinks first.
This could be in a museum some day! It's not safe with me! It should really be in a doormanned building.
Boy, I wish the flamenco was popular here.
Yes, I am familiar with this syndrome -- she's a two-face.
No, no, this wasn't moving on. I got the hook. I wish I could get a lesson in that.
Well how could you just play your message in front of anybody?
So, I'm uh, I'm afraid we're going to have to pass.
(Eating) Oh yeah. These are fantastic, fantastic. (To server) You know, I'd love to get a jump on the next batch, where do you come out? (Server leaves) (To Anna) She's been ignoring this section all night. Quesadilla?
So I set up a screening, everyone takes their shirt off and click, I snap me a shot of a bear-chested Kruger.
Well, maybe it was Ghostbusters? Where ever it was, it worked!
Because the underwear is pulled up from the back and ... it wedges in..
Pauline? . . . Wait a minute. I got it. My brother once impregnated a woman named Pauline.
Im sorry, I dont see the big deal about being a matador. The bull charges, you move the cape, whats so hard?
you know, just by conversing, you can really learn a lot about a person.
Well, we just blew 240 bucks on a wheelchair.
Yeah, but get this, the message said 'call me if you have the time'. Heh heh if I have the time, you get it?
Well I just stomped some pigeons in the park. They - they didn't move.
He knows I'm waiting. He sees me. He just doesn't wanna look.
Yeah. Hmm. Boy these really do pinch. I tell you, if I ever find the son of a bitch that stole my glasses...
Well, what was I supposed to do? Get out of the shower, put on my bathrobe? Go all the way down to the other end? Come all the way back?
Oh, no, no, no...you sit right here...I will get you a nice snack.
Yeah, just tell him to hurry it up.
I love when they touch your arm. I can't get enough of that. Why is that?
I know. It's Mickey Mantle's number. So not only is it an all around beautiful name, it is also a living tribute.
I am in and out of my personnel file at work all the time.
No, no, she might just think its a gift.
The uniforms! Did you see how they played? Listen to these comments! (reads from the paper) "Wade Boggs 'What a fabric! Finally we can breathe.' Luis Palonia 'Cotton is king.' Paul O'Neill 'I never dreamed anything could be so soft and fluffy.' "
Look, you wanna have sex right now? Do want to have sex with me right now? Let's go! C'mon, let's go baby! C'mon!
(tormented) Aw, shut up Jerry! Just shut up!
We're on the Grand Central, there's no traffic.
(Looking over the writing materials they just bought) Bics? What, d'ja get, bics?
Aah, yeah, yeah. Won't you head on in, we'll be in in a second. Be right with you.
Cut it. (goes back to the group) (Yelling) Would you stop signing?
What kind of a shake does he have?
Well, here you go. What do you think?
Uh, excuse me, Wyck. Uh, are we, uh, almost done here?
Yeah, "duty". Do you know how much duty is?
Why did you refuse the package. Everybody loves a package.
(coming back in) Alright, alright. Can we go out and eat?
So, were talking, and I dont like to go too long before I ask them out, I wanna get it over with right away, so I just blurt out, What are you doing Saturday night?
Now, because of that stupid rye bread, I gotta keep them all separated for the rest of my life.
I know what I'm doin'. In fact Mr. Wilhelm gave me one of those little stress dolls. All right. (gets up) Back to work. (acts annoyed and leaves)
(irascible) Oh, I see. So your time is more valuable than mine. Is that it? You're a delicate genius!
Yup. It's really just a question of what kind. Thinking about a bar stool.
Yeah. Never seen anyone so bored. I'm working like a dog here. Give me a moan. *Something*. I'd settle for a belch, for god's sake. All right, come on, let's have it.
(contemptuously, imitating Altons voice) Hes in the bathroom.
Oh, I, uh, I disagree. You've, uh, you've been living in America too long. (indicates the bag of oranges) You've forgotten what it's like to have no oranges.
This is what my life has come to... Tryin to meet a mute.
(taking the phone from Elaine) Jerry, why is Elaine getting your mail?
Well, it wouldn't fit you. The sleeves are too short.
What did I get or what do I say I got?
All these years I've been chuckin' and you've never told me?
Mothers say things. My mother goes babbling on and on like a crazy person.
(laughs hysterically, gesticulating wildly) This is all blowing up in my face! My serious girlfriend, and my torrid love affair have accidentally crossed paths. I have ruined three lives... (grabbing coat) Well, I understand if you never want to see me again, so... (points towards door)
Alright, alright, fine. (Gives the keys to Elaine.)
(singing) Master of the house/Doling out the charm/Ready with a handshake and an open palm/Tells a saucy talk/Loves to make a stir/Everyone appreciates a...
I won't be able to, concentrate in front of you.
So she starts vaccuming, back and forth, back and forth, her hips swivelling, her breasts, uh... (trying to think of a word)
(To his girlfriend) Nina, you have to decide right now. Jerry or me?
So, I am have to going to break up with you.
Ah, no, no. Are you sure? A girlfriend?
Greetings, people. Greetings. Greetings and salutations. What a beautiful day for a ball game. Let's play two! (Sits down, says to waitress ) Oh, I'll have the chicken salad on rye, my usual, you know what I get, darlin'. (Turns to the Gang) So, let's see, I had a little conversation today with Mr Don Mattingly - (to Elaine) he's the first base man.
(pulling out some money) Uh, yeah. Hang on. Just... yeah.
I offered to pay. She should've said no.
Take it easy. Take it easy. It's not the end of the world.
Who doesn't like cashmere? Find me one person in the world that doesn't like cashmere. It's too expensive.
He's getting on a bus, damn! (To the blind man) Those are nice glasses.
(laughing) You think you're going to the other side with "Hi"? You're not going to make it.
So, just bring her here. This is all you really need.
Yeah, sure. (big smile) Then my father will have no place to sleep. (snaps fingers) He's gotta move out.
Oh, no. No. No. No. No. Nothing. I'm fine. Everything's fine. Fine. Just get a little nervous on the weekends, that's all. Could I, uh, could I get a glass of water?
You see? Now that is a handsome man. (Elaine and Jerry look right at George) Oh please.
Well, you know, It's interesting, you know, under that pressure, what you're capable of.
Alright, well you know what'cha gotta do, you gotta go through her purse. Y'know, the-the credit cards, driver's license...
People can drop change down here, Jerry. And theyre too lazy to pick it up.
Yeah, well...a little rough finding something good in your price-range. (to Jerry) But you, my friend, may be in luck.
It's not that I want to keep talking about it? just think that the subject should resolve itself based on its own momentum.
The next morning, I woke up, and it was going like this. (moves his arm slowly) I can control it if I really concentrate. But otherwise, (arm moves) oh.
Well, actually you did miss one nugget of entertainment. (Pause) Have you ever seen Elaine dance?
(Turning back to Jerry, he takes the check back. He just now notices the shirt Jerry's wearing, and snickers, pointing) Nice shirt.. (Laughs, Jerry shrugs) What is this? Is this what you wore on the show?
(Threatening) Hold it! One more step and were walkin!
That's right. I got his whole car downstairs.
So, uh, gentlemen, do we have a deal?
Right. He cooks my food, he cleans my house, he does all my shopping for me. And there you go, that's your program.
O.K., Danny, take a swing. (Tartabull swings the bat.) N-No! No! No! You're opening up your shoulder.
I dont understand, you never talk to her about other women?
Atlantic City? (thinks) Yes! Yes! I will go to Atlantic City. I'm in. I'm down.
Well, you know, I've been lyin' about my income for a few years. I figured I could afford a fake house in the Hamptons.
All right, I made up the part about the car, but the rest is true. And he hated me anyway!
Pretty chintzy, huh? Considering the money she makes.. She's a big executive for Federal Express.
You don't think I can keep a secret?
Excuse me, I've got a maniac stalking me, I'm not staying in the city.
So is it all over between you and... Marsha Mason?
You know what? I should really go talk to her. Nothing confrontational. Just two adults sitting down trying to clear the air. You know, I just know if I could spend some time alone with her. I've got to. (he grabs his jacket) I've got to.
Did you explain to her about the good naked and the bad naked?
You can't leave! This is an ambulance! This is an emergency!
Wait a minute, that is my apartment. I earned it with 34 years of misery!
Wait a minute. (astonished) You're thinking of moving to Florida again?!
What? I'm not eating bread now. I'm off bread.
Two-man? It's all me. Kruger doesn't do anything; Disappears for hours at a time, gives me fake excuses. This afternoon I found him with sleep creases on his face. The only reason I got out to get a bite today was that he finally promised to buckle down and do some actual work. (turning around, George sees Mr. Kruger at a booth eating a piece of cake) Oh, I don't believe this. This is what I have to put up with, Jerry. (He walks over) Mr. Kruger? Who said he was going to do some actual work today? Who?
Oh, thanks, Bobby. (To Celia) Well, I guess I'll see you in four days.
(Panicky) Uh, yeah. You know, Doctor, I gotta tell you, I feel a lot better.
Oh, I think so, and I can prove it. You see, I was doodling on the bill and uh, so if you have a twenty in there with big lips on it... well, (smiles) that's mine. Would you mind opening up the register?
Alright! Please, please! I cannot have this constant bickering!.. Stress is very damaging to the epidermis! Now, I have an important photo session in the morning - my hands have got to be in tip-top shape, so please - keep the television down, and the conversation to a minimum.
You know, uh, she has no female friends! You know that, don't cha? Something strange about a woman whos friends are all men.
I bet they're probably doing summersaults about us over there. You think they get butler stories like that everyday? (He calls Susan)
By the way, have you spoken to Elaine yet today?
Because I cant call a woman with other people in the room. Come on, lets go.
The Duty Free Shop? Duty Free is the biggest sucker deal in retail. Do you know how much duty is?
Hey listen... umm, instead of the movie... uh, maybe we'll go back and uh you know...(nudges her head with his head)
She wants to keep it quiet. She... thinks we have a real future together.
He knows this guy, Wilkinson. He made a fortune in the stock market. Now hes got some new thing. You know, theres supposed to be a big merger. He wasnt even supposed to say anything. You guys should think about doing this too.
She doesn't like. Here is your blue one, it's her favorite. (Takes sweater out of his bag.)
My heart! My heart! (To Assistant) Where you going? Are you crazy?!
I feel terrible, I can't be responsible for breaking up a marriage. Oh no (starting moving for the door, Elaine begins to stop him)
Great! Great! I actually just had two meaningful intelligent conversations with Corbin Bernsen and George Wendt.
(energetically) "Well seems it's about time for George's lunch."
What is this? Did you ever get the feeling like you've had a haircut but you didn't have one? I'm all itchy back here.
Listen, lemme ask you a question. What if I got a cup of coffee with her?
So, how come nothing ever happened between you and Nina? (Getting paranoid) Is there a problem with her? Is she a man?
What was that line again? Something about finding your way in a shadow?
The doc called and said the lab's backed up and now I'm not gonna get the results for another two days.
Oh, yes I am. Mr. Thomassoulo likes to play dirty. Well, theres nothing dirtier than a giant ball of oil.
Im outta the picture. I am outta the picture. (laughs) Its only a matter of time now.
(Sliding over to make room for her) Sit down. Join us, please.
I love it. New office, new salary. I'm the new Wilhelm.
(clears throat) Maura, I, uh- I want you to know... I-I've given this a lot of thought. I'm sorry, but... we, uh, we have to break up.
(Holding out his arms - giving praise) It's beautiful. Now, what do I say?
Hello? Amanda. Hi, yes. Listen. You know, I'm thinkin', we might just be better of bein' friends. Yeah. Yeah, you know what, I can't even really talk about it right now. Bye-bye. (hangs up) (happy with himself, but then sees the burned up photo) No! No!
(shouts) Awright already!! This is a very key issue with me, Jerry. I had this name for a long time.
Hey, Lloyd. (Shakes hands with Lloyd) How's it going? (chuckles)
(shouting) Turn your key, Maura. Turn your key!
..And I went down there one time to see...
Excuse me. I believe you just ate my Twix bar. It was dangling. And when you purchased your Twix bar, you got a little freebie, and you never bothered to ask why, or seek out its rightful owner.
I just thought of a great name for myself, if I ever become a porno actor.
No. (dips the chip) You dip the way you want to dip...(bites the chip) I'll dip the way I want to dip. (dips the chip again.)
...and then when I saw the photo I remembered where I'd seen him; the boom box incident.
I just wanted to tell you that I really enjoyed Fair Game. I thought it was just brilliant.
Well that was a really stupid thing! You know what's going to happen now?
All right. Let's go over it again, one more time.
We ordered the wedding invitations today,, Nothing can stop it now. Nothing. It's here! It's happening. Can I do this? I can't do this...Look at me. Look at me I can't do this, I can't do this (manic) Help me Jerry, help me.
Huh? You know? Spring. Rejuvenation. Rebirth. Everything's blooming. All that crap.
You gotta look at this. I pulled it in perfectly equidistant from the car in front of me and the car behind me.
And you really believe this guy doesn't want to have kids.
All right, just gimme that. And gimme some of those Sweet & Lows.
No, I fake limp on my right. This is a real limp because I sprained my ankle.
This is not a Metallica concert, it?s an opera alright, a little dignity, a little class, just give me my ticket, I will stand over here and sell it.
That's it. That's the line... (squirts mustard into Jerry's coffee and stirs it) ...that destroyed my life.
Does the heater even work in this car?
Lemme tell you sum'in. When Ponce looked in that mirror and saw that he hadn't changed, and that tear started to roll down his cheek? ... I lost it.
"Jerry", oh my God. He wants to talk about "Jerry"?
(excited, pushing Jerry forward) All right, let's go, let's go, let's go, come on.
You know you buy a big salad for somebody it would be nice if they knew it.
You just checked your watch. Are you thinking of bailing on him?
Yeah, and you were engaged for like a minute, I was engaged for a year.
Why, you think you can, beat me up?
All right, forget that idea, it's not for you....Okay, okay, I got it. You run an antique store.
Hey, where you just at the health club?
What do the Chinese have to gain by faking a cure for baldness?
Well, if I could talk to the mothers and have sex with the daughters, then I'd really have something goin'.
(smiling) Uh, hi. Uhm, remember me? I..I'm the guy who looks like Neil?
Yes, I agree. I hope my parents go long before I do.
Nah, I guess I should really get moving on this, huh? I'm gonna go. (Opens the door, letting Newman in. Leaves)
Wait a second, wait a second, what coming in, what woman is coming in?
I told her I would have to think about it.
This catalog is all about how to score in a foreign country.
That's it. This is it. I'm done. Through. It's over. I'm gone. Finished. Over. I will never work for you again. Look at you. (laughing) You think you're an important man? Is that what you think? You are a laughingstock. You are a joke. These people are laughing at you. You're nothing! You have no brains, no ability, nothing! (knocking object over on desk) I quit!
Do you wanna talk about hotels, or do you wanna win some ball games?
What are you like a sadist? No matter how bad somebody feels, you can make 'em feel worse. I bet you're rooting for a tumor. (pointing to her)
Hey, by the way, what'd you think of Miss Yoshimura?
You know, I think I'm a little bit scared of her. She's five-three, like a hundred pounds. I'm frightened to death of her.
Jerry, for all I know this guy went out of his way to not invite you. How am I gonna feel if I show up with an uninvited, unwelcome intruder?
Why is what I do is so important? Why must I be always the focal point of attention? Let me just be, let me live.
People smoke, Elaine. My mother smoked. It didnt hurt me.
It's fine, we'll just meet him at the bubble boy's house.
(to Elaine) He asked you to get the mail?
It just didnt work out. What can I do? I wanted to love her. I tried to love her. I couldnt.
(Arms out) I am king of the county. You?
Of course I'm all right. I'm here with my girl, Nina. And what better way to pass the time than gabbing with my best friend -- with whom there are no secrets. (Flashes two intertwined fingers) Like this. Since the fourth grade.
Yeah! like the big toe is like the captain of the toes, but sometimes the toe next to the big toe gets so big that there's like a power struggle and the second toe assumes control of the foot.
It's funny! (To Elaine) and it wouldn't kill you to not be so funny either.
My censor quit two years ago. He checked into a clinic. Emotionally exhausted.
Hey, I'm his nephew, all right? Don't worry about it. Go ahead. Check it out.
I love the mirror in that bathroom! I dont know what in the hell it is. I look terrific in that mirror. (George sits.) I dont know if its the tile or the lighting... I feel like Robert Wagner.
Hey. I got Jon Voight's LeBaron. (Jingles the keys.)
(on tape, singing) "Believe it or not, George, isn't at home, please leave a mes-saaage at the beep. I must be out or I'd pick up the pho-one. Where could I be? Believe it or not, I'm not hooome." (beep)
That woman was unequivocally the worst date of my life.
Canceled? Do I still get credit for the pick up? I was here!
I hate asking for change. They always make a face. Like I'm asking them to donate a kidney.
Why does it always seem like I'm the only one working at this break-up?
All right, I gotta get going. My parents are expecting me.
A woman that hates me this much comes along once in a lifetime.
She said first row! Right behind the dugout!
I think it's neat. You don't hear that much about god anymore.
I couldn't. You know, if it's not about sports, I find it very hard to concentrate.
Oh, you know, Lloyd, I really don't have it.
The show! Forget about the show! We should take the idea to a different network
Hmm. What about a hole? You ever put anybody in "the box"?
Oh, please don't tell me you love me again, Jerry, I can't handle it.
They should call it round tine. You know what I'm talking about.
Yeah, but nothing happens on the show. You see, it's just like life. You know, you eat, you go shopping, you read.. You eat, you read, You go shopping.
Ho ho. This bizarre ?harrod? experiment must end!
Gee, Kramer, I uh...I don't know what to say.
This woman drove us out of our minds
I just thought it would be nice. A little variety.
I didn't even know it was a job.
Eat me alive, huh? We'll see who can make it in *this* town.
(sidling in) Is this a bad time? I hope I'm not disturbing anything.
Yeah. She should be commending me for treating everyone like equals.
Well, I was buttering myself up for a nice shave --
That doesn't explain the lipstick on the dashboard?
(Entering Jerry's apartment with a cartload of computers) Jerry, I've found a way to beat Lloyd Braun! I buy the computers myself, I store 'em in your apartment. Then, after I win the contest, I bring 'em all back and get my money back. Ha ha! It's brilliant. What? What's wrong with your leg?
So, Im thinking, as shes saying this, Im thinking great, the relationships over. But the egg salads on the way. So now I have a decision Do I walk or do I eat?
Well, I didn't really tell Susan about it, and she doesn't really have anything else to do.
(looks back to the group) I can read lips. You said let's sleep together.
Well we were all eating the raisins. And I remember you--you were eating some of the raisins. And then you left, and the raisins were gone. And I was just wondering if, you know (chuckles), maybe you took them with you.
40? I'm payin' 60 to my maid. She doesn't do laundry and I'm gettin' nothin'. All right. Once she pinched my ass, but I don't know what that was.
look at this guy. Does he have to stretch in here?
(Reading the card from Whatley) "This holiday season a donation has been made in your name to the Children's Alliance."?
No no no no no, this has to be carefully orchestrated. You go to a fancy dinner, flowers...
I'm sure I have a low IQ. I've been lying about my SAT scores for 15 years.
I'm gonna go meet Danielle. (grabs his coat) There's a new Neil in town! (triumphant laughter) Hahaha!
We all got along. Everyone seemed very pleasant.
Yeah, is he still mad at you for crashing his Thanksgiving party?
You think this is the plane that Ted Danson gets?
Yeah, see, uh, when we met, I was over there and, uh, you were over here, so the image, uh, the image was reversed, like, uh, like in the mirror.
Well, it was a hell of a ride.
You know what? I can't do this. I can't read books anymore; books on tape have ruined me, Jerry. I need that nice voice. This book has *my* voice. I hate my voice.
She knows there is nothing to talk about.
(agitated) He's lying, sir! I'm tired of all your macho head games!
You can't - huhu, All right let's go.
I have a point, I have a point.
You know, I'm sorry, I...I hate to be one of those people, but we're right in the middle of this thing...I can't hear.
Can I ask you a question? Would you mind switching seats?
Really, I was, I was only kidding around.
Well a lot of people consider me small and prestigious.
Of course. So, Im looking at it. I look up, I see shes looking at it. Our eyes lock. It was a horrible moment. I just..
No sports jacket? I don't need a sports jacket? Writers wear sports jackets.
Hi, I was just uh... I just had one little question about uh, my assignment.
Oh no - I'm so sorry, it's the Moops. The correct answer is the Moops.
They refuse to put cucumber in the salad. I need cucumber.
Okay, uh, look, if you want to just keep on doing the same old thing, then maybe this idea is not for you. I, for one, am not going to compromise my artistic integrity. And I'll tell you something else, this is the show and we're not going to change it. (To Jerry) Right?
Alright, now. What mood am I in, what mood am I in?
I can't believe it. He's going! He's fired!
Y'know if the guy dies, the art could really be worth something...
Well, I didn't mean to hurt you kid.
(crestfallen) But you said it was my call.
I noticed people staring at my head because they like what they see.
Excuse me, uh, what are you doing in there?
So, you didn't think this was a date?
(internally) How am I gonna get out of this? Think Costanza, think!
Well you see he slipped, and he landed on a kinda of a..
You should've seen her face. It was the exact same look my father gave me when I told him I wanted to be a ventriloquist.
I'll try some on and see how they look. It's just hair.
I'll tell you what I'd like to do. I'd like to replace that rye.
So you're a lawyer. What kind of cases do you handle?
Yeah, it bothers me. Doesn't it bother you?
Yes she is. It's a pity we won't be seeing much more of her.
(chuckles) Really? Well, we'll just see about that. Ta-ta, Tut-tle.
Ah-Ha! (he turns and walks over to the refrigerator)
Well, you know, it's really very funny, because you know what we got here, really? We really, really, just have a terrible misunderstanding. You see, when I passed on the deal, I thought that's what Jerry wanted me to say. Y'know, I, I misinterpreted.
I once told a woman that I really enjoy spending time with my family.
ho ho ho ho. You know I only got two weeks left of unemployment. I got to prove I've been looking for a job to get an extension
Maura. (starts acting dramatically, looking from Maura to Loretta and back again) Oh, my God! What are you doing here?!
Aw, Mr. Kruger, Sir. Merry Christmas! (Hands him a card)
I tried to tell you, but you wouldnt listen. No, ho, ho! You were gonna get a deal, huh? Theres no laws in this place. Anything goes! Its Thunderdome!
Anyway, I-I would like to-to pay for the cleaning.
I'll tell you something, if I'd own a company, my employees would love me. They'd have huge pictures of me up on the walls and in their home, like Lenin.
You know what, I'll just uh, I'll just look around for a little while. (moving to come round the counter) I'll just browse around.
They're for protection, Jerry. Can you tell where I'm lookin'?
Seriously, have they though about changing the setting?
You see. You see! Listen when is your next drawing class?
Oh. It's just horse manure (huh huh - laughs, he points back at the horse that walked by) Horse manure's not that bad. I don't even mind the word manure. You know, it's, it's nure, which is good. and a ma in front of it. MA-NURE. I mean when you consider the other choices, manure is actually pretty refreshing.
Is she the only girl in the whole world? Why can't you get find your own girl?
Oh, nothin' much, . . . talkin'. . . . Oh, oh, oh, did I have an unbelievable idea today!
Not a plane crash. (leaving) Is it a plane crash?
Well, I'm sorry, Timmy...but I don't dip that way. (takes a chip.)
(through mouthful of food) So, Carrie, you and Susan are cousins. So your baby daughter is gonna be Susan's second cousin, right? So what does that make me?
Nah, the cable's out. What's with you? You look dead.
(con't) A-Anyway, I was thinking we would take two cars up to the cabin and that way if one of wanted to stay you know...
Oh no no no, if you must know, I would rather be with her than go to the game.
He just walked away! And once again I'm standing here like a little man. Well not this time! (George leaves the store and follows the dog owner) You! Dog man!
(frustrated) Oh, look at this. There's no place to park around here. I don't even know why they sell cars in Manhattan.
No. This is not cotton. Here, lemme see. (Tries to look at the tag on the uniform. Tartabull gets creeped out and resists.) Will you stop it? (Looks at the tag.) Oh. Of course. Polyester!
(animated) What're you talking about?! She's very concerned! She said she was gonna get it back.
Boy - I'm really surprised at Elaine - that whole phone business - she should know better than that.
This is a real piece of junk. I don't even feel safe on this thing. I have a good mind to write a letter toMr. Kimbrough.
Know him? Would you, uh, like to meet him?
I understand you offer a 50%-off 'bereavement' fare...?
Huh. You must think Im pretty stupid. (The mechanic shoots him a look as if he cleary does think hes stupid) That was no 5th Avenue bar. I can see the crumb right there in the corner of your lip! Now, that-that-that is a cookie - and we all know that Twix is the only candy bar with the cookie crunch.
(to Carrie) It's just that, I know her, and boy...
I thought tomorrow maybe we'd try a little corn beef.
No no. That's not what I was trying to do.
No, not really. I'm just saying this to you because I like to hear myself talk. Yes, really!
Well then...then you really have something to think about because.....you know if there's any doubt in your mind ....and.. and,, it doesn't even have to be a big doubt, you know even a tiny doubt, a DOT of a doubt.. and.....
I was trying to loosen 'em up a little bit.
You see, you see? I see things as they are and I say, 'no!' Uh, wait, you see things as they are not and you s- Wait, uh, you see things, do you see things as they are? What do you say when you see things?
That's why the world's in the shape it's in.
(annoyed) Hes an importer/exporter, okay? (beat) Elaine ever call you back?
I left it at Heather's. Are these alive? (pounding on glass display)
She probably never heard it. Don't you see what this means? It's like the whole thing never happened. It's like when Superman reversed the rotation of the earth to save Lois Lane!
Where did this come from all of a sudden?
All right. So, what theatre you wanna go to tonight? We got 61st and 3rd or 84th and Broadway.
Yeah, look at me. Now I GOTTA FIGURE OUT THE HAT SIZES OF 59,000 DIFFERENT PEOPLE!! WHAT IF A PINHEAD SHOWS UP. I GOTTA BE ON TOP OF THAT.
I'm cold too. At least you've got a coat. Let's get in the car.
Well why don't you take off your hat and stay awhile.
(spins his chair back to face her) So you got a $25,000 a year raise.
You never should have taken away his keys!
Yeah, it's me sir. It's been a harrowing few days. uuh,After the car accident, I-I crawled into a ditch, and managed to survive on, grubs and puddle water, until a kindly old gentleman picked me up.
(very casual and raising his hand in the air) Yep. That's five!
Who am I going to meet who is better than her? No one, Jerry. No one's better than her.
So... here I am. Ready to take you to the Hamptons.
Why don't you think before you do something?
Never mind what happened, just give me the key.
Yeah. Hey Jerry, listen to this. I discovered something even better than conjugal visit sex. Fugitive sex! Now, it's like everytime -
Summer of '89 I'm at the beach. This family sits up next to me. I go in to the surfs and when I come from out, my clothes, my towel, my umbrella, they're all gone. I am furious, I start screaming to these kids demanding my stuff back and finally I lose it; I grab their boom box and I chuck it in to the ocean.
That's right, who the hell are they? How dare they?!
All right. I will see you boys later.
Oh, hello, it's you! (angry) Listen lady, I got six minutes left on that meter, and I'm not budging til you admit you stole my twenty dollars. (smug) Huh-hu-hur, you're not so tough when you're not on your horse, are you Ruthie?
We sat there for twenty minutes, chewing, staring at each other in a defunct relationship.
Well, I'm just expressing my gratitude to our gracious host.
That's what she says. I say, listen. It was an old cat. It died of natural causes. So get this, now she tells me that I gotta buy her a brand new cat. I say listen, honey. First of all, it was a pretty old cat. I'm not gonna buy you a brand new cat to replace an old dying cat. And second of all, I go out to the garbage, I find you a new cat in fifteen seconds. I say, you show me an autopsy report that says this cat died of starvation, I spring for a new cat. So she says something to me, like, uh, I dunno, get the hell out of here, and she breaks up with me. Now don't you think that would be a great case on L.A. Law?
(talking to nobody) I like horses. Maybe I could be a stable boy.
(pleasant surprise) Really? (admonishing) You know Gary, I really have to say, I'm a little bit hurt that you didn't decide to confide in me.
We talked about his new batting stance, you know, I'm not crazy about it, but I said , 'Donny, go with it 'till it stops workin'.' Donny baseball. He's a helluva guy.
Well, I'm the good boy again. Can you believe that?
Yeah, he once bumped into reverend Yung Sun Moon.
I just feel terrible This is just terrible.
Give me two bucks. Ill do it for two bucks.
(more excitement) You were gonna fix me up with her?
I, I really should go home. Ya.. actually I'm planning on spending the day with my father tomorrow (short laugh) we're uh we're going to a father-son picnic, just the two of us.
Yeah. There's something wrong with that? I'm a character. People are always saying to me, "You know you're a quite a character."
What did they do for toilet paper in the civil war?
I been, uh, thinking about the family. Tell me, uh, about Aunt Baby.
You're giving me the "it's not you, it's me" routine? I invented "it's not you, it's me". Nobody tells me it's them not me, if it's anybody it's me.
I went in with a pretty woman? You know, kinda short, big wall o' hair, face like a frying pan?
Well, maybe she decided to celebrate her birthday on the Monday after the weekend.
I'm afraid I'm just not interested in how I present myself. If those kind of superficialities are important to you, this probably isn't gonna work.
Oh, what time is it? Eight thirty? I'll tell you what's on. You got Major Dad, Blossom, very funny programme...
She comes out of the bathroom, I'm in up to my wrist. You should have seen the look on her face.
She tolerated the strawberries and the chocolate sauce, but eh, it's not a meal, you know? Food and sex, those are my two passions. It's only natural to combine them.
All you got is instant coffee? Why don't you get some real coffee?
Yes, but I still don't feel right about letting you into Kramer's apartment without his permission.
Oh, well, don't worry about it -- he's got plenty of money. (spins his chair away from her)
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. It's from that grapefruit that Jerry squirted at me.
Oh, what's the point? When I like them, they don't like me, when they like me, I don't like them. Why can't I act with the ones I like the same way I do with the ones I don't like?
I went to look in the mirror, it wasn't there. You threw off my equilibrium.
(hangs up the phone) That's my toaster. I got to go. Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh!
"Arrrrrrgh!! .. It's George.. Oh! Sports wholesaler. yeah. yeah. .. thanks for calling back. No , no , no still got the shoes, still got the shoes. Lots of them. This is.. beautiful athletic gear."
I can't have any parties while they're out of town. (he leaves to return the soaps)
Oh, well, a mantel's a whole different story.
(signs) Sorry. (expectant) You're sure, uh, there isn't anything else?
You know what? I could probably do this. Whats the difference.
Yeah. Actually it was in gym class. I was trying to climb the ropes and Jerry was spotting me. I kept slipping and burning my thighs and then finally I slipped and fell on Jerry's head. We've been close ever since.
It's just that I was the one who actually paid for the big salad. She just happened to hand it to you. But it's no big deal.
Jerry? Yes, I suppose he is white. You know, I never really thought about it. I don't see people in terms of color. You know, there's someone I'd like you to meet. Hand on... (To phone) Is Mr. Morgan in?
Well, losing a loved is, uh...I mean, forget about it. (Starts wolfing down the sandwiches.)
What about me? I was a total failure. Everything was fine. Now this thing's gonna be a success and God's gonna give me a terminal disease.
So you're telling me instead of them being happy to see me, they're going to be upset because I didn't bring anything. Ttst --You see what I'm saying?
You know, it's very impolite to tell secrets. Are you talking about me?
Coulda fixed me up with Marisa Tomei. She said I was just her type!
( to Jerry) What about the letter, should I think about the letter?
Why? Did she say something to you about why she broke up with me?
You got less than sixty seconds. That's like dismantling a time bomb. What got into you?
Well, at least we know the prosthetic squirrel hips work ... sorry bout the set.
Well, it always has to be explained to me, and then I have to have someone explain the explanation.
Oh, Scott, Scott. He's really great, isn't he?
Well, anyway, the book club meets tomorrow, Mr. Temple.
(swerving) Hey! Watch it! Did you see that guy? He just gave me the finger!
Okay, Okay. Who do you think you're talking to? What are ya' you trying to make a joke, because it's not funny. I can tell you that.
Would you like a Pepto-Bismol? I keep them in my wallet...! (Russell goes into the bathroom and shuts the door.) (To Jerry) Do you think he liked it? (From the bathroom, we hear Russell violently heaving his guts.)
Oh my God! (coming out of bathroom) You know what I just realized?! If they get divorced an' live in two separate places? That's twice as many visits!
The better looking they are, the faster they go! I mean, I see they out there on the street, they're zooming around, like a blur. Like they have a motor on their ass.
No, no no it's not about postponing. I just think the first day of Spring is the perfect day to get married. You know, Spring! Rejuvenation! Rebirth! Everything is blooming all the
Actually I think I'm gonna take a few days off (starts to leave)
Pamela?! Awright, I tell you what. You look like nice people, I'm gonna help you out. You want a beautiful name? Soda.
I was in the middle of a conversation.
Look, I gotta tell ya...I been thinkin' about it, I just don't feel right about letting you into Elaine's apartment.
Yeah, I told her how toilet paper hasn't changed in my lifetime, and probably wouldn't change in the next fifty thousand years and she was fascinated, fascinated!
Absolutely. You're telling me there's no room to move on pasta. All starches are a scam.
I think I can sum up the show for you with one word NOTHING.
He's getting phone calls here now? (he's standing near the counter and eating chips out of a big bag)
I'm not going to see that nut doctor she went to Europe with.
No good? All right, uh how about Art... Cor.....
Heh heh heh hey, new suit (raises coffee cup as a salute / toast)
(smiling) Well, we're certainly glad that you could make it.
You start flirting with him and I'll come by and, while you're keeping him busy, I'll slip it in his drink.
Alright, very good, very good...go fold your little balloon animals, Eric. Eric! (chuckles) What kind of name is that for a clown, huh?
(shouted after Elaine) You know, I got nothing outta this!
Almost. Couldn't get the girl go out with me the second time.
She's leaving me dirty messages on my answering machine.
Yes, full. I love to be full ... love to sit back, loosen the old belt and digest away for hours. Let those enzymes do their work.
Babu Bhatt? How I'm going to explain this?
Oh, yeah, me too, me too. Boy oh boy oh boy...! You know, in fact, I've been thinking about it, and I feel like I'm stealing from you! Five-hundred dollars! It's gonna be worth thousands soon! You know what? On second thought, I can't even accept it.
He wants to meet you? I'll tell you what. I'll show up. He doesn't know we're friends. I'll pretend I haven't seen you since High School. I'll back up the story.
Well, sometimes you can't help these people 'til they hit rock bottom.
Oh. This I need. Hello!! Hello. i..i..is this the hair restoration clinic? ...Does anyone speak English?
Oh, this is unbelievable. I'm stuck. Every time I think I'm out, they pull me back in.
Let me ask you something. What do you do for a living, Newman?
Woah, back it up, back it up. Beep, beep, beep. Tractor story?
But now I have my own market research. Actual Japanese viewers, that love the show! I'm gonna talk to Kramer.
Oh, my god that's Saddam Hussein. The dictator.
During that period when my folks were separated he went a little crazy.
Then, the last person to leave is Wilhelm. He sees my car, he figures I'm burning the midnight oil. Between the two of them, they think I'm working an 18 hour day! (he stands there with his hands on his hips, a wide grin - laughing.)
(grateful, relieved) Thank you! I'm gonna make you both so happy!
Oh, I think that's fantastic. Good for you. Nice. That's very nice.
Stay back! (Runs out of the room, pushing Jerry out ahead of him)
Sir, I just got a call from the terrorist. I told him to call back here.
(pops his head out of the covers, looking a bit confused) Uh...you know, uh...pleasuring you.
Oh, sure. Sure, anything. Can you believe it? There's nothing wrong with me.
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm terribly sorry.. (Bends down, and starts picking up her things)
Where? (He looks out window and gets hit by a tomato)
Because, if I'm looking straight ahead, and something enters my field of vision, that's merely a happenstance. (Elaine loudly snaps and unfolds her napkin at the next table to get Russell's attention.)
What do you mean not goin'? Come on, we got plans here. Call her up.
'Cause believe me, I would only say this to you and maybe a psychiatrist, maybe. Well, her nose is a little big.
I cant stand doing laundry. Thats why I have forty pairs of underwear.
Let me ask you this. If you stick your hand in the hair is it easy to get it out?
'Kay. I'll uh, I'll see you later. Anybody want some tomatoes?
Listen, I have a tremendous favor to ask.
(surprising his parents in the kitchen) Welcome back.
Ill eh, Ill just have a bowl of chili.
(Fed up with his parents) Actually, I think I'm pretty clear on it.
Just do it like a Band-Aid. One motion. Right off! (beat) She is sexy though. Dont you think?
She must have seen me eating it on TV.
All right. See you tomorrow. (George sighs, exits.)
I don't want hope. Hope is killing me. My dream is to become hopeless. When you're hopeless, you don't care, and when you don't care, that indifference makes you attractive.
Get out of here. I didn't see any cameras there.
Oh no, Morgan is a good man sir.
Yeah. Just take 'em out and ride 'em around for about..half an hour.
Well, does he wear bland, drab, olive colored clothing?
I bawled uncontrollably. I just poured my guts out. And I'll tell you, Jerry, it was incredible. I never realized how powerful these tears are. I could have postponed it another five years if I wanted to.
Wa, I'm not getting out of this cab
I tell you, I really don't think so-called relationship humor is what this show is all about.
(to himself) Yeah, you said it. (to Wilhelm) Uh, excuse me, Mr Wilhelm. Uh, do you really think... Well, is this downtown trip really necessary, you know, for the project?
Uh, good. You know, you might wanna try eating it with one of these. (Holds up lobster bib)
I wonder what toilet paper was loike in the 1860's. Did they carry it in rolls in their duffle bags?
Well, I'm the boyfriend. Otherwise, what's the point of being the boyfriend? This is where you have to be when you're the boyfriend.
No, I can't. She knows I go there. It's not secure. (the call waiting beeps) Hey, I got another call comin' in. I gotta let the machine get it. Bye. (hangs up)
(to Claire) Now, a woman calls me, all right?
Hey, she wants me to dress uh "smart casual." What uh, what is that?
Kramer, this is perfect. I need you to go in there, pretend you're a doctor and check this guy for moles.
Sure, sure, sure, sure. (patting Jerry on the shoulders) How about these seats? Are these fantastic, huh? Huh? I feel like Lincoln.
Oh, of course. (motioning Estelle to enter) Of course.
I know, they're out of their minds! It's fantastic!
Her scalp was clean. She had a nice skull. There just wasn't a lot of hair on it.
So, you want to come down to Mario's Pizza with me and help me pick up the Frogger?
Yeah, of course she did. That's all I ever heard growing up is 'Why can't you be more like Lloyd Braun?' Did you know he was in a mental institution?
I cant believe how easy it is. Im virtually Orthodox. All I have to do is read a few books, memorize a few prayers, and Im in the club.
I just don't like the idea that any time theres a dinner invitation there's this annoying little chore that goes along with it.
Wait a minute. I must have been winking down at the office. That's why Mr. Wilhelm was acting so mysteriouso.
That's what I'm afraid of. You know Mr. Steinbrenner, . . .
Mon...? No, no, I can't wait til Monday, that's impossible, I gotta talk to him now. Where does he live?
Wow. (he runs his fingers through his hair, and then brushes the resulting fallout off his jacket)
I just wanted to talk to him for a minute, but Ill come back.
Well, I still think you shoulda told me.
Uh, Jerry, you want your blankets tucked in?
Ah, you still going on in front of Bania, eh?
How could anybody be so selfish and inconsiderate!
Did you ever see her lose her temper. I was once late cause I bought a Panama hat -- she grabbed it by the brim, pulled it down so hard my head came right through the top of it.
Toasting makes me uncomfortable. But toast, I love. Never start the day without a good piece of toast. In fact, let's toast to toast.
(Holding up Kramer's book) According to this, it took.. 10 hours. It eased into the water like an old man into a nice warm bath - no offence. (Pause) So, uh, Clarence, how about abandoning this apartment, and letting me shove off in this beauty?
Wait a second. (George gets up and heads for the statue in Kramers hands.) I cant believe this! Let me see this.
Look at that. They got lobster on the menu. Who would order a lobster here. I mean, do they bring a lobster in everyday hoping *todays* the day.
It was kinda fun. (Elaine gives Jerry a cold cloth for his jaw.) You know, maybe his name really is J-O-H-N, but he changed it to J-O-N for show business. Well, you know, J-O-N is a lot zippier.
What, he can't jump out of the chair? How long does that take? Here look at this. (he moves to the end of the booth) Here, watch. (stands up) Criminals. Boom. I'm up. (pretends he's shooting) Stop It! Stop It! Stop It!
I dont know, what were doin here, this is ridiculous.
Yeah, yeah, like it's just part of the conversation. Oh my boyfriend really likes watches. He's a real watch freak. We-e-ell that's fabulous. (snaps fingers in the air a couple of times)
Yeah. So what's going on? We're gonna shoot the pilot and then it's gonna be on TV the following week?
I tried! I almost threw it down the incinerator, but I couldn't do it. The guilt was too overwhelming. (Grabs the doll, opening the door to leave) Susan's so attached to this thing.
How are they gonna make that book into a movie?
(delighted) Jerry? It was incredible! Models! As far as the eye could see!
Hey, maybe I could bribe one of those women that hand out the towels in the powder room.
(getting animated) Yeah. Yeah. You know the odds of me being anyone's type?! I have never been anyone's type, but apparently, this Marisa Tomei loves funny, quirky, bald men.
The last time I saw her, she was naked.
Oh, I find you so charming. You wuss.
Except for one small problem. Hah, I left some books in her apartment.
Oh no no no no - we have to be in California next week. We're starting a TV show.
I said preferably cashmere, for warmth. So in front of the whole party, he says, 'No. I don't want you stretching out the neck hole.'
Wha - what happened? What are you doing back so soon?
That's a very good question. You know she and I go out for dinner, she doesn't even reach for the check. That?s all I?m asking for is a reach. Is that so much to ask for?
Thank you for leaving me alone with him!
Now Peterman wants me to go to the funeral.
Lot of good ones. I don't even want to mention anyone because I'm afraid I'm going to leave somebody out.
If only she could get fired. Is there any way that could happen? I mean I know how to get myself fired.
It's all departures. I see nothing but departures. (to the woman beside him) Do you know where the arrivals are?
(oozing fake sincerity) Well, as much as I enjoy all the good-natured ribbing, nothing really makes me happier than spending money on the people I care about.
I don't know. Perhaps I can better serve the world this way.
I don't know. She..She's having some problems with this guy she's seeing.
Oh, yes. I already packed up my desk, sir. I can be outta here in an hour.
Hey. There is a couple of people that wouldn't mind having me out of the way.
I need a break, Jerry, you know. I gotta get out of the city. I feel so cramped...
Why do they have to do that in front of people?
You know what? it's better than Elaine's, too. I gotta give her a call. (Moves tward the phone)
Well, you got no place to go. I'll tell you what your problem is You brought your queen out too fast. What do you think? She's one of these feminists looking to get out of the house? No, the queen is old fashioned. . Likes to stay home. Cook. Take care of her man. Make sure he feels good.
All right, All right, keep your towel on.
Yeah. No, no, no, wait a minute, I always have tuna on toast. Nothing's ever worked out for me with tuna on toast. I want the complete opposite of on toast. Chicken salad, on rye, un-toasted with a side of potato salad ... and a cup of tea. (laughs)
Uh, uh, yeah. Actually, the, uh, I-I bumped my elbow on a desk and uh injured something an.. now it sort of moves involuntarily.
Yep, and the photo was all fixed and back on his desk, no thanks to you.
Listen uh, David, I, I, I want to apologize about that comment
All names sound strange the first time you hear 'em. What, you telling me people loved the name Blanche the first time they heard it?
Im going to find out whats going on. All right?
(To himself) How am I gonna do this? I'm engaged to this woman? She doesn't even like me. Change the subject? Toilets were the subject. We don't even share the same interests.
I don't know. I closed my eyes and made a move.
You know, I cant believe youre even considering not playing. We need you. Youre hitting everything.
This is incredible! This is one of the greatest things I've ever done in my life! I'm gonna call my mother.
Dogs, twists, a kind of fermented chicken drink.
Oh really. You tell her you shaved it?
Yes! Because it is the mature, adult thing to do.
Well, I wouldn't want you to do that. You know there's a lot of losers out there.
A different name for the butler? (Russell throws up again.)
No. I need a guy that can rig a Frogger machine so that I can move it without losing power, 'cause I have the high score. H-hello?
(harassed) Are you aware that I'm being charged for Tuesday's appointment? I had to take my mother to the chiropodist.
Well I am actually going to have a secretary and I get to do the interview.
Aw, I've just got to say it once, everybody else gets to say it, why can't I say it?
Wait, wait wait, not so fast. Jerry, you gotta take me to get this thing refinished.
(he walks casually to Tom, and taps his arm) Listen. I know we've had our problems in the past, but we got a show to do tonight. Time to pull together as a team. Life's too short. I say, let's let bygones be bygones. If you took the raisins, if you didn't take the raisins-- They weren't even my raisins. I was just curious because it seems like a strange to do to walk into a room, audition, and to walk out with a box of raisins. Anyway, whatever. If you ever want to tell me about it, the door to my office is always opened. In the event that I get an office. You'll come in, we'll talk about the raisins. We'll have a nice laugh.
She just dislikes me so much... It's irresistable.
(laughs) Youd have to be a real loser to try something like that.
Sure. Thank you for coming in. (Tom eats some raisins)
Did you see the way she pointed at the check? She gave me the finger.
Never! It is a part of me. I will just return the chair, and it will be easy, because the receipt is in my good friend.
( rubbing his eye) Ow, Ow you squirted me.
(adamant) Yes I am. I defy you to come up with a better name than Seven.
Jerry, I like being with her. Plus, I know where she is all the time. I have relatively no competition. An-and you know how you live in fear of the pop-in?
All right, listen, I'll see you guys later.
Well, I think we need more special days at the stadium, you know? Like, uh...Joe Pepitone Day. Or, uh...Jon Voight Day.
Why can't we do this on the phone? What's Kramer doing now?
(hitting Cynthia playfully with a napkin) Stop it, stop it.
Hu humm? i suppose we could go to Lincoln Center and I'd be wearing sneakers and jeans and that would be fine too.
Hennigans. I was there sitting in the office and the cleaning woman comes in. I've always been attracted to cleaning women. Cleaning women, chambermaids.
Yes, I know so. You happen to be a very eligible lesbian.
I'm just sayin' I wanna have some fun.
Oh, I love full lips. Something you can really put the lipstick on.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. But then, I said to him, 'Oh yeah? Well, the jerk store called, and they're running outta you.'
What, you think I'm going to repeat the whole thing now?
Oh they'll get out of the way. You really smell banana?
Every woman on the face of the earth has complete control of my life. And yet, I want them all.. is that irony?
I tought I picked up a little something. I'm very good at this. Did you pick up anything?
Assistant to the General Manager!! Do you know what means?!? He'd could be askin' my advice on trades! Trades, Jerry, I'm a heartbeat away!
Alright the administrator's on the third floor. I'll meet you guys back at the car.
You don't listen when people talk to you anymore!
It's all worked out. Nina and I will have dinner Thursday at the restaurant where Babs works.
I don't know. This sandwich is making me flush.
Ah. You see, the man who was the butler, uh, had gotten into a car accident with Jerry, and because he didn't have any insurance, the judge decreed that the man become Jerry's butler.
Yes it is. She just took credit for my salad. That's not right.
And she loved me. Hoo, ho, she really did.
Jerry, I can't. It's like saying to Pavorotti, "Teach me to sing like you."
Yeah, I want to see if there's anything I can do.. maybe get him another job.. maybe I'll hear of something.
A little notice would've helped! How many people?
All right. I am happy, and I'll tell ya why -- because the two of you were making me and every one of your friends sick! Right, Elaine?
Thank you! Thank you very much. (Jerry and Melissa stop and look at George)
I guess there are no small diseases, only small actors.
No difference. I could care less. She's Jerry's girlfriend.
I-I'm already here. I'm here. I'm here. Uh, you know what? If you want a computer, call me. I-I gotta go.
bowling! what do you say bowling? bowling's insane! bowling is crazy time
Boy that-that bank clock is-is eight minutes off.
What's the difference? You know they way I work. I'm like a commercial jingle. First it's a little irritating, then you hear it a few times, youre hummin it in the shower, by the third date it's (sings) "By Mennen!".
Hum..( to Elaine) Hey! did you talk to Paula?
(Smiling to himself) You don't have to worry about me. (Nodding, gloating) I won a contest.
This car out there is taking up, like, three parking spaces.
We just came from Chadway's(?) What's going on.
To do what?! Work in a post office? Is that what you want me to do?
Oh, come on. What, are you kidding? GEORGE I'm much more comfortable criticizing people behind there backs. Anyway, look who's talking. You just broke up with with Melanie last week because she "shuushed you" while you were watching TV.
I'm trying to get out of this Big Brother program. So when you get to Paris (handing Morty the postcards) all you have to do is drop 'em in any mailbox.
Siege mentality, Jerry. They really want me out of here. Theyve downgraded me to some sort of a bunker. Im like Hitlers last days here.
And maybe we could go out and do something.
Well do you want me to take it off?
You think she thinks I have a beautiful face, or is she just saying that?
She's playing a recital this week at the McBierney School. You wanna hear her play? I got two extra tickets, you and Elaine could go...
(quietly) ehh. (pausing to look at both of them) So what made you change your mind?
Well, I've to every Brentano's. This thing's flagged in every database in town!
What did they put on this tuna? Tastes like a dill, I think it's a dill.
horning on my rock climbing trip. It's just supposed to be me and Tony
If you had like five chickens could you tell them apart by just the way they acted? Or would they all just be walking around? Bak, bak, baak, bak? Cause if they have individual personalities Im not sure we should be eaten `em. What's the matter with you?
Oh, no. No no no no no. Id have to advise against that. What, do you know this woman a month? Lets see, youre going to be with her seventy-two hours. Thats a dating decathlon.
(to the guy next to him) This guy stinks. (speaking of Michael)
Probably because this whole Universe is against me!
Oh, no no no, I haven't even seen her apartment yet. Tomorrow night's the first night.
There's no house! It's a lie! There's no solarium. There's no Prickly Pete. There's no other solarium.
Great move, telling him, by the way, real smart move.
Oh! euh.. Yeah We just can't go to the supermarket to get some candy.
you said "step off"? wow, that is too much hey..huh hey (George turns the cap his wearing backwards like Tony) Tony, I huh, I just had this brainstorm for us. Can you guess what it is?
First class doesn't make it anymore. Now you get on the phone with Kimbrough, tell him what happened and tell him to get another plane down here, but this time, the good one - the Ted Danson plane.
You know, it was really wrong of you to back out on that deal.
I take it off when I go to the, uh, y'know, to the "office".
(shouts) Of course there's something wrong! (points at Jerry) We had a pact!
(enthusiastic) Yeah. You get a couch. I get rid of my father. It couldn't be more perfect!
Shouldn't we at least drop off your bag?
Because my cousin's imbecile dog was rolling around outside and they got in his carpet.
That's really very nice of you, Eva. Thank you.
Yeah, when the season starts. Right now, I sit around pretending that I'm busy.
(going into the bathroom) Well, you on all fours, that thing vibratin', kickin' up sawdust, ho ho! She'll get the picture!
He's older, completely covered in filth, no whistle, but I think it's him.
Jody let's do this agian real soon (he tends his arms for a hug but she avoids him)
My father wears his sneakers in the pool! Sneakers!
Not necessarily. Mustard lends itself to the squeeze.
Yeah. Where's he taking you, by the way?
I'm stuck. Pull a little, just a second. Don't start the train! Don't start the train!!
(pauses for a few seconds) OK, I'm tellin' you right now - if your kiddin' around I'm not gonna be able to be your friend anymore. I'm serious about that. You got that.
Yeah, You remember the, the little eh, bank book, there?
I tell you this. If the real Phil Rizzuto was down there, this wouldn't be happening!
I am. The folks are twelve hundred miles away. (gleeful) I'm basking in the buffer zone. (looks for the waitress) 'Nother piece of pie here!
You took me to one of your shows..
Was that wrong? Should I have not done that? I tell you I gotta plead ignorance on this thing because if anyone had said anything to me at all when I first started here that that sort of thing was frouned upon, you know, cause I've worked in a lot of offices and I tell you peope do that all the time.
I did it. Hunh, we're going out as soon as she gets off of work and it'll still be daytime. You know I, Im much better in the daytime then I am at night. it's less pressure.
Ah, well, that's very mature. What about you?
...he embibed her glistening spell...just before the other shoe...fell.
Its been a long night. You go home and get some sleep.
Well, I'm sure they'll be able to fix it. You can't stop modern science. Can't stop it, you can't stop it. Can't stop science. Can't be stopped, no way, no how, science just marches--
So, how do you like the way I talked you into comin' down here?
Alright, alright, but no funny business, same deal as last night.
(not expecting the statue to be thrown) Dit.
No, no. No, no, no. It was not trash!
So I really liked the pictures I picked up here yesterday.
(somewhat annoyed) I suppose you could be an architect.
That damn delicatessen that - that is last time they screw up one of my orders.
Oh, yeah I'm sure he loves to hear from fans in the locker room.
No, I did not! (They exit the coffee shop.)
No, no, no we'll talk about it later.
Drink your soda! Come on! I know you're there, laughing at me. Laughing and lying and laughing! I had to go to Reggies, Jerry! Reggies!
I know someone wholl do it. Shes good. Shes honest.
Right. I mean, we're on a subject. Why does it have to be changed?
As you care for me. Which is why it is very important that you never breathe a word of this to anyone about the... you know. What, with Clarence Thomas and everything.
And get a picture of him, with his shirt off.
Because it's really a pretty good little story. Don't you think?
Eh, gee, I hope you have the key for these things.
(jokingly) Well, so, legally, I could marry your daughter.
It would have been nice if someone told me about it. I just think you could have said something. That's all.
I don't believe it, what did you say?
Oh, no no, I cant go back there. Jerry, its so awkward and, you know, it could be dangerous sexually. Something could happen, Id be right back where I started from.
Her roommate. I've driven women to lesbianism before but never to a mental institution.
You know, I got this little swelling right here. (rolls up his sleeve to expose his wrist) It's kinda painful. What d'you make of it?
I am not buying something just to get change.
...and the Jews steal our money through their Zionist occupied government and use the black man to bring drugs into our oppressed white minority communities.
Sure, dudes in this town are dime a dozen.
I don't know how you can let this guy handle all your money.
Jerry, figure this out. I'm in the coffee shop, and this beautiful girl I could never even talk to, mistakes me for her boyfriend.
He can be pedantic. He can be pedantic.
What red dot? What are you talking about? Jerry come here for a second. Do you see anything here?
Well, I wanna put a picture of me and my boss Mr. Morgan up at the office.
All right! All right. I'll tell you what. How about this? Got the date; March 21st, the first day of spring.
Kramer, I can't help you. You're gonna have to get them some place else.
Well, I'm still here. You took out the other guy!
She invites me up at twelve oclock at night, for coffee, and I dont go up. No thank you. I dont want coffee. It keeps me up. Too late for me to drink coffee. I said this to her. People this stupid shouldnt be allowed to live. I cant imagine what she must think of me.
Well, we would like to be in business. Let's do business. We'll have some business. Let's have business.
Well, you really did it to me this time, Seinfeld. . . . What the hell happened here?
Now Im in the worst position of all.
He's got Marlon Brando's. I could go to Marlon Brando's house if I really wanted.
No, not nervous. I'm good, very good. (A beat, then he snaps) I can't do this! Can't do this!
As you will see, the candy bar is paid for, and yet, remains dangling in the machine. (Notices that the Twix slot is completely empty) Hey, its gone. Where is my Twix? (Quickly looks around. His sights fall on the window of a door labeled "Employees Only". The same mechanic from before is eating a candy bar) What?! That guys eatin it!
Well I was lost, I never saw the first one. By the way, you mind if I watch it here?
Ah, listen ah, I don't mean to bother you but ah, silly me, I- I think I may have left my hat in your apartment. So ah, I thought I'd just come by later and pick it up.
It's Allison. I dated her right after you. She's obsessed with me.
(hanging up) All right, Jerry. I'll do it. See ya.
No no no, no mistake, no mistake. No, no , listen, we're going to get married over Christmas, I It doesn't make any difference to me. It's fine. Really.
(a little worried) He uh, he doesn't have the auto shop any more?
C'mon Jerry, let's go. What was that all about?
Yeah, yeah, not fan talk, not gushing, you know? Actual conversation, I was incredibly articulate!
What kind of a sick person would do a thing like that?
Ah, a, You know what, maybe I'll just come ... umm, yummm (stammering)
I'm sorry, uh, it's not like I'm gonna see something I've never seen before.
Well...I was in the locker room showering, and I...I had to go, so...
Well Dad's been planning this for such a long time, he bought a new blanket, and he got tha...that game with foam paddles and the velcro ball. (laughs)
I'll tell you what that is - that's a violation of club rules. Now I got him! And you're my witness!
Well it's a little strange. You going to start to talk like Elaine from now on?
All right, all right ( Goes to the bathroom)
(Laughs, snorts) I said, I said 'Get outta here! No story? Is that what I said?'
Wow,  god! You see this is all I think about. Sleeping with a giant. It's my life's ambition.
Is that so? Or could it be that you're just a *little* bit worried that you may have missed the boat?
You know, Lloyd, I-I've been to the doctor (hands George the card) there's really nothing they can do.
What if the pilot gets picked up and it becomes a series?
Wow! I didn't try that 'til I was 23.
Well if you didn't think I was parking, why did you put it in head first?
Oh sure, sure. You wanna be alone, sure. I understand that, you wanna a little time to think uh thing..ponder things..you know..ruminant..(chuckles) you go ahead, lotta stuff on your mind..you think things out..Think, mull, mull, do a lot of mulling. (short laugh then exits Monk's)
Listen, you go over to the ticket counter, I'm going to go stop in the gift shop and pick up a copy of Time magazine. There's supposed to ba blurb about Jerry in it and I think he mentioned my name!
Well, sure Joey, sure, I would be thrilled.
I know, I know. Kind of a cute Nazi though.
(to Donna) Why did you have to get me in trouble?
Hey, Jerry, remember Frogger? I used to be so into this game. Gettin' that frog across the street was my entire life.
You know, my mother used to walk around on our apartment just in her bra and panties. She didn't look anything like you, she was really disgusting, really bad body. If you could imagine uglier and fatter version of Shirley Booth. Remember Shirley Booth from Hazel. Really embarrassing, cause you know I had only mother in the whole neighborhood who was worse looking than Hazel. Imagine the taunts I would hear.
Ohh, I have tremendous respect for people who work with feet. I mean, to dedicate yourself to the foot - you're toiling in virtual anonymity. I mean..
She calls you today and she doesnt make a plan for tomorrow? What is that? Its Saturday night!
I meet this women, Sheila. She works down at the one hour photo pace. She's got this incredible smile. Like she's got extra teeth or something
(panicky) What are you gonna do? Are you gonna call the police?
Oh... (George looks around and sees the chef hiding behind a plant it's Bob!)
Hello? I can take an hour off your hands. Give the kids a chance to see a real live Yankee.
The point is, however it got done, it's done. So, any luck with the car?
Ah, excuse me. Do you have, uh, change of a dollar?
Well, let's just say it wouldn't exist without me. (Notices another person in the library dressed the same as Celia.) So you two uh, shop at the same store, (hu)?
OK, OK, I never even had him for gym.
he's the first cool guy I've ever been friends with in my whole life. You know.. it's a different world when you're with a cool guy, he's not afraid of anybody. You should hear the way he talks to waitresses.. he gets free pie!
I like Christian rock. It's very positive. It's not like those real musicians who think they're so cool and hip.
I have no power Do you understand? I need hand. I have no hand.
So you don't speak *any* English at all?
Excuse me, are you the guy with that funny laser?
(Watching the mechanic leave) I know about the vein! I cant believe this guy..
(Yelling out to the whole coach) Funny guy! (Points to Jerry) Right here!
I just want the both of you to know how much you mean to me, and I love you both very, very much.
Did you see the homeless guy on the library steps screaming obsenities and doing some calesthetics routine
(Motioning toward waitress) I think she likes me.
Yeah, they're all through ruining my life. What the hell are they still doing here? Lemme see this pamphlet. Hm. All right, so I'll, uh, get back to you.
Ow! What are you doing under there? Hey, stop that! Don't eat that! That's not food! (to Robin) He's suckin' down Equal packets!
Yeah, but they let me go on and on all about the Hamptons, they never said a thing! You don't let somebody lie when they know you're lying. You call them a liar!
Nougat? Please. I think Ive reached the point in my life where I can tell the difference between nougat and cookie. So lets not just say things that we both know are obvious fabrications.
(Laughs) Relationship intern...hey, what if two of us teamed up?
Hey, people, people, people, people, people. Not bad, huh? Excuse me.
Well if Houdini couldn't do it, what chance do I have?
All right, all right. KNOCK IT OFF. Come on, let's go.
He's right! It's the same thing with the femenists. You know, they want everything to be equal, everything! But when the check comes, where are they?
No, No! She's going out with a friend of mine. It's only courteous that we should try and like each other.
Why not? Pay is good. I got dental, private access to one of the great handicapped toilets in the city.
Especially her. She does not like disappointment. Well, I have to do it. I can't make December. There's no way I can make December. Right? I mean, you can see that, right? I mean, look at me. Look. Look. Can I make December? I can't make December. Right? Look. Look.
(hesitant) Uh, Mr Wilhelm. Uh, about the project...
Well, Im going with him. Id like to... Ive never done a solid before.
You mean a walk back in? That's the toughest move in the business. You're sending me out into no-mans-land, and if I get shot down I have to crawl all the way back. Well I can't do it! I can't do it, I tell ya!
What if he left you a used Kleenex, what's that, a valentine? Now you go up to him and you tell him that if he's thinking of turning me in, that I got the goods on him!
That's not the point. The point is I was here first.
March 21st. Hey! So, you're gonna back me on this, right?
I'm grotesque . I look like a troll.
Um, excuse me, have you see a guy with like a horse face, big teeth, and a, and a pointed nose?
You don't understand. He's got this big party coming up. He's been looking forward to this for months. This is gonna destroy the whole thing.
No! No. It's not good, I don't think so.
It's like going to the bathroom in front of a lot of people and not caring.
No, I can't. What if I meet a woman? I'd always be worried about that first moment where I'd take it off and see that look of disappointment on her face.
"'Cause when he questioned me about it I was sweating from the Kom Pau.."
All right, I think they have fleas there. So what...
Frolf, frisbee golf Jerry. Golf with a frisbee. This is gonna be my time. Time to taste the fruits and let the juices drip down my chin. I proclaim this The Summer of George!
They made me buy it.. A hundred bucks this thing cost me. (Gesturing to the book) How dare they?! I got news for you, if it wasn't for the toilet, there would be no books.
(Takes a sip) Hey, it's not too bad..
It's not that easy. It's like "Beat The Clock," there's a lot of pressure there.
It was on a magazine! And it still had the doily on.
That's uh, KL5-8383. Are you calling them soon because, they keep very strange hours.
(agitated) Well, I, I couldn't come. I, I had to drive my mother to, to the chiropodist.
(still pleased) She doesn't know that. We say that you do.
Look at that guy. Right there. Isn't that the guy from the show? He's..he's wearing the jacket.
You know, I don't see how you can sit there eating that and not even offer me any?
(Embarrassed) That's all I could find. (A moment passes) Would you mind getting the door?
Well, I just had a fight - I need a group dynamic.
Lemme tell you something, that Jerry Lewis? You wonder how some of these people get to the top? It's ideas like this! Brilliant! Hah-hah! (Notices that the briefcase is damaged.) Look at this - what the hell happened? The whole side is damaged here...and the lock is broken.
This woman just set me up for a job!
Did you happen to notice that Julie handed the big salad to Elaine?
Jerry, I felt like a straight man in some horrible sketch. He was riffing! Riffing! On my pain!
I know. This was the only woman I never lied to. Well thats not entirely true.
....But after that we really talked didn't we?
No..hummm, What do you know about what you look like.
Yeah, ha ha, It's not the toilets, it's not the toilets. It's something else. Are you ready for this?
(whispering) Glenda, can I ask you a favor? Can I have this seat?
I can't. He's been on my case about not paying attention. Besides, it's too late, I already told him I heard him.
Are you sure? Oh, look who I'm talking to. The president of NBC. (forced laughter)
I dont know where the nurse is. Sweetheart why dont you get a nurse for mommy?  Anyway I was just curious. Remember the other day you were saying something about my trip.
Whew! Anybody see that poster in there? That is weird, wild stuff, huh? Whew!
Wait, wait, did you ever see him throw up?!
(Laughs as they leave) It's working already! (Both exit)
Oh, ok. Thank you. It was good talking to you.
(putting the car in reverse) Oh beautiful! Look at that, the dream space right in front of Jerry's building. Huh? Dreams can come true, what did I tell you?
It's like the manager coming out and asking you for the ball.
Listen. Let me ask you something. If you and Mona were ever to... dance, how do you decide who leads? I mean... do you take turns? Do you discuss it beforehand? How does that work?
Imagine if I had to see them both on the same day? (mirthless) Haha! It's like runnin' a double marathon!
Ohh yes, yes. Yes Jerry they were all over me. It was like Rocky 1, Hm. Diane came up to me, threw her arms around me
And everything else has changed. But toilet paper is exactly the same, and will be so until we're dead.
I know the D is the biggest. I've based my whole life on knowing that the D is the biggest.
Oh, I had no choice. She squeezed it out of me! Shed tell me she loved me. All right, at first, I just look at her. Id go, Oh, really? Or uh, Boy, thats, thats something. But, eventually you have to come back with, Well, I love you. You know, you can only hold out for so long.
(to Jerry) Why dont you just turn it inside out?
(While pointing at Jerry) Not me! Him! His fault! He betrayed me!
Yeah, and a whole new me. I'm up two inches in these babies!
Uh, excuse me. Uh, pound of Arabian mocha java, please.
What for? . I'll tell you what for.... for hair.
Well, I - I could, Uh, I could give the money back. Here. (Holds it out)
Are, are you sure this is decaf? Wheres the orange indicator?
I'm not through here, Jerry. (Picks up the model of the conference room.) I'm gonna keep on investigating. This thing is like an onion. The more layers you peel, the more it stinks. (Pam enters, George leaves.)
And why shouldn't you? Be fresh Stay fresh
Elaine said your pretty good at this stuff.
(outside, looking the guy trying the suit through the window, and thinking out loud) What's this? Can't I leave this place for a second? (goes in, take off his jacket, walks to the guy and talks to him with an european accent) Can I help you?
After dark? Please. At their age, that's like swallowing stun grenades.
(to Kramer) This man is a genius. Genius!
I- I'm pretty sure I left it eh, behind the cushion of the chair ... accidentally.
I would like to dip my bald head in oil and rub it all over your body. [No reaction] You don't understand! It's a miracle! You don't understand because you don't speak English!
When you're talking about a movie like "Beaches", moving from the chair to the couch , . . . that's quite a voyage.
You ditched me. That's twice. Now I demand to know what's going on!
All right, believe me, you're not going to marry him.
No, she's taking this course in education for her masters. It's part of her research project, so I have to be a guinea pig.
You think you could hook me up with these guys?
I think we got a bite on it. (Exits)
Exactly, you know what I'm talking about, right?
Now if you will kindly help me unwedge my front wheel, I'll be on my way.
Oh, she didn't think it was funny. What is she, Rowan & Martin? We're supposed to meet with NBC tomorrow! She completely shattered my confidence. And I'm paying for this, she's my employee!
Oh no no no, they don't want to join us.
I don't understand things were going so great. What happened? Something must have happened.
What? Elaine's big-head guy? They have you the apartment?!
Look, Deena, I know you think I'm crazy, but I'm not. This is just a series of bad coincidences.
And, um, it was quite good. In fact, you even incorporated me into the show. I'm not actually a performer. Although, my parents felt I had talent..
It's not contest. The guy had nothing! The ship went down, he got into a life boat, I mean, come on.
(getting up out of his chair to get out of the Mohel's way) No, No.
(to the waitress bringing his doughnut) And a slice of devil's food cake.
Yeah, he's in my bed. I'm sleeping on the couch.
Elaine you don't understand. I had 103 temperature when I bought that sweater. I was so dizzy I was seeing red dots everywhere. I thought everything in the store had a red dot on it. I couldn't distinguish one red dot from another. I couldn't afford anything. I have nothing. I haven't worked for a really long time. (Jerry is standing right behind George. Jerry takes out a hankerchief and starts fake-crying in it.) I mean look, I have no clothes, look at what I'm wearing. It's just a little red dot.
I don't know, I have to call her, tell her where we are. I'm very lucky she's even considering seeing me at all.
So what, he's got a couple of good jokes.
I told her I liked her. Why? Why did I tell her I like her? I have this sick compulsion to tell women how I feel. I like you I dont tell you.
I can't get a massage from a man.
(Leading Nina out the airport) Oh, no. No. We're good. Let's get goin'. Alright. (Almost bumps into Jerry) Watch it, funny man. (Leaves)
Out? Oh no, I've been to four other places, you're the only ones that have had it.
I know. I know. That's what I do. That's what I do.
Look, I have my system. First I look for the dream spot right in front of the door, then I slowly expand out in concentric circles.
This week. My father got a deal from a friend of his. It's Gore-Tex. You know about Gore-Tex?
Yeah. Yes! I just haven't seen you in a long time.
I could have had some ice cream. I think that might have calmed down the nachos.
Out. (Jerry shakes his head in agreement) Wow. I spend so much time trying to get their clothes off, I never thought of taking mine off. (Jerry nods; George looks at his watch) Alright, Hey come on, get out of here, Dophne gonna be here any minute.
(laughing) Have something else. Cmon, have a little dessert?
Why don't you find a doctor that doesn't know your difficult.
No no no no, you have to approach this as if he was a woman.
She called my office. She said shes been in the Hamptons since Sunday. She didnt know if I was trying to get in touch with her. Her machine broke, and shes been using her old machine and she doesnt have the beeper for it.
What come on? Have you ever dated a woman that worked in your office?
Everybody's talkin' at me...I can't hear a word they're sayin'...just drivin' around in Jon Voight's car...
Oh, right, right, the intervention. Should we leave?
The story is the foundation of all entertainment. You must have a good story otherwise it's just masturbation.
Hey I'll get married if I have to. Al Netchie will think twice before he opens his mouth about me again.
She knows that I have her clock. I know that she has my hat. I think she's getting ready to make an exchange.
Remember when you came to audition for us?
I'll tell you what. Why don't we just get a couple of dishes and we'll just share 'em.
Maybe the baby would like to see my spot. A positive, uplifting message to start his life out with. Huh, You can still get a great space in this city - if you apply yourself.
I couldn't help it! Elaine moved the mirror, I got discombobulated.
The Rosses have started up a foundation, Jerry, and I have to sit on the board of directors.
It'll have to be a night job anyway. You don't normally work after dinner, do you?
You have to stand tough sir. That's why I had to hang up the phone.
I love it! This is fantastic! Look at this couch, is this velvet?!
Hello, oh, hello. You remember, ... Susan, from N B C.
Yes. She's got great skin - a rosy glow..
She's stickin' it to me that she makes more money than me.
Oh yes, of course, and we have to be fair. (placing the suit further away in the rack)
I think that's what the back of closets are for.
Oh, this is fabulous. My God Elaine, you have to taste this.
hey, you know what? I just remembered something. I had a dream about that guy last night. This is amazing.
No! I am not going to see a psychiatrist!
Let me tell you something about that tag. It's no 31, and uh...let's just leave it at that.
Yeah, like he was really gonna take your money.
I need some water. I gotta get some water.
uh Tony? there's not gonna be too many sandwiches
No, no I do. You know it's just...
(fever pitch) Marisa Tomei's sitting home, Elaine! Wh..why didn't you tell me that Katy was friends with Marisa Tomei?!
A signal, right, um, okay, uh, okay, the signal is, Ill call out tippy-toe!
It's a performance, Jerry. Like what you do.
(disbelief) What? (laugh) Wh... what're you talking about? I'm not the one with the problem. (defensive) Lloyd Braun was in the nuthouse, not me.
We were in the lobby during the intermission of the play. I was buying her one of those containers of orange drink, for five dollars. I reached into my pocket to pay for it, I looked down; theres this piece of green floss hanging from my fingers.
You think I should come clean? What d'you think, you think I Should confess?
Wait a second, wait. Why are we together?
(pointing outside) Why is there a Cadillac parked in front of the house?
You know, all these years, I've always wanted to see the two of you get back together.
Neeson? How are you comparing Liam Neeson with Jon Voight? Jerry, we're talking about Joe Buck. If you can play Joe Buck, Oskar Schindler's a cake walk. (Opens the car door for Jerry, Jerry's about to get in.)
(To Jerry) We got work to do. What about the meeting?
Wait, have you ever seen him throw up?!
Listen, listen, dont get worked up, cause youre gonna know the whole story the minute she steps off the plane.
I think she wants me to take her home.
I tell you what, you give me the twenty, and I will buy *you* a popcorn and soda, and I'll throw in a bon-bons.
Kramer, trust me, this is the best bathroom in midtown!
Ponce de Leon? Okay. (to Jerry) You sure you don't wanna go?
"BECAUSE IF HE CAN'T JUMP. THERE GOES MY SNEAKER BUSINESS!!"
It was a good idea. Susan liked it. Now, if he hadn't vomitted all over her, we'd be writing it right now.
Of course not! Wash it, dry it, move on!
Perhaps. (hehe) I walk in, everything is organized -- messages, appointments. And I can't tell you how proud I am of myself for going with Ade.
(cuts into Jerry talking) Chocolate chip mint? Oh well, actually Jerry I prefer chocolate chip. What is it about the chocolate and the mint that makes it go so well together?
I knew I had hit my high note so I thanked the crowd and I was gone.
If youre having second thoughts, if you didnt want it, dont worry about it because uh, you know, I, I...I could take it, you know.
Absolutely, uh, lets see there's, uh, Vandelay Industries, I just saw them. I got very close there. very close.
I guess that leaves me in the clear...
I'm the bad boy. I've never been the bad boy.
Why did he tell you and not me?
Just..go back. Pretend the whole thing never happened.
Elaine? It's me, George. (Elaine opens the door.) Hey, sorry to bother you so late. (To Billy) Hey! How ya doin.' (To Elaine) Uh, did you get any of those sponges?
I'm trying to buy some of the clothes back. (realizing something) Hey you wanna come over for dinner tonight? My mother made all this extra Paella.
They wanna have another meeting? They wanna buy it?! They wanna but it?! Oh! I tell you! We're gonna be rich!! What are we gonna get for this? Fifty, sixty thousand?
'Why don't I rent the movie.' See, this is when I like you. Alright, now I'm relieved. (Kramer enters and comes over to the booth.)
Parking in a handicap spot. Right in the middle of his United Volunteers meeting. When he got back, he chased after me with a baseball bat.
You know, I think we really need to be in front of a television set. You take T.V. out of this relationship, it is *just* torture.
Yes, they are bold. Jerry, what do you think?
I think that's Mr. Hayman. ...The gym teacher from our High School.
You have no idea how refreshing that is.
No (snorts - Laughing nervously)... I'm gonna wear black shoes.
Do I really have to buy her something?
Oh, my God.. (Buries his face into his hands)
She cant even afford to go out to lunch. She's been eating in a high school cafeterias She pretends to be a teacher. It's pathetic.
Nah, I have asthma. (Robin's kid grabs George's leg from under the table, and George struggles.)
All right, I've got to go down to the unemployment office. Wanna take a walk?
I'm the one he wants! He's coming to settle the score.
What happened to the pact? We were both gonna change. We shook hands on a pact. Did you not shake my hand on it uh?
What? I'm not married. I'm not allowed to go out with somebody else?
(PULLING OUT ESTIMATE OUT OF HIS POCKET) Well, profit. I think you'll see from the estimate that I'm not really profiting that much. They might be a little high, but..
(doing the voice) Im slippery as an eel
The table, the stereo, the VCR, the velvet couch, where's the velvet?
Fifty bucks a month, that's incredible! Okay, thanks.
Okay, I guess I'll see you down there.
I'll tell you what, why don't you read this book and let's just see if you can explain it to me.
I can't come out. They're standing right by the door. Throw it up!
Yeah, you're right, you're right. (To Elaine) Alright, maybe he's not interested, but you still know him - can't you just ask him?
Because, I've got the coat. I can sit in the car and not get cold.
It strikes me a lot of guys are doing that kind of humor now.
Alright. I'll run it by a few people.
Well, you know. You get to a certain point, you wanna know about your roots.
Cold? How are you going to do that? You're not one of those guys.
So I lugged that table. That big heavy massage table all the way down to the cab! You ever seen one of those things?
Well, last night she told me that she liked you. Not you, the disturbed you, so I had to tell her the truth.
I'm not gonna give you my card unless you tell me what it's for!
Yeah, sure. I was showing a condo on 48th street. Besides, you think I wanna miss this? (chuckles)
These old guys, they're up at 4 a.m., by two thirty they're wiped. (animated) How did we get back onto you?!
You know, you know what's great about our relationship?...It's not about looks.
(incredulous) I look just like him. I. Me. (flings his arms out) This! This is what her boyfriend looks like. How is that possible?
Five-thousand? Why would anybody buy Kramer for $5000? (laughs)
Oxygen! I need some oxygen! This is major.
What are you doing here? I thought you said you hated Isabella's?
Daphne. I have to tell you something, this is very difficult...
Same thing. My god, I'm getting married in December, do you know that?
Wow. Uh, what do I have to do?
Just put it on! All right now, remember she had her nails done today so remark how you like the color. And if you need me you beep me, all right. Here you go, hey, hey, hey, hey...(sprays Binaca into Jerry's mouth.) Go get'em you're a tiger!
You never had sex in the office before?
(crafty) Not necessarily. Why don't you take back the couch you gave me?
Kramer goes to a fantasy camp. His whole life is a fantasy camp. People should plunk down two-thousand dollars to live like him for a week. Do nothing, fall ass-backwards into money, mooch food off your neighbors and have sex without dating; that's a fantasy camp.
Elaine, get something! Its all taken care of.
And I always take care of my Pisano's. So here is a little something. (drop in tip and worker looks the other way, so George decides to take it out and try again only to get caught)
Hey, Jerry, what was the name of the exterminator who fumigated your apartment when you had fleas?
Well, I was very comfortable! I've got my nuts here...
What are we gonna tell Jerry about the car?
Well, sure. They're Jewish, and you're a shiksa.
Anyway, I don't even get a thank you. I don't get it!
Please, it doesnt look good. Boy, boy, girl.
Let me ask you a question. Who would win in a fight between you and me?
I don't know. He can be so weird sometimes.
Behind the dugout, are you kidding? How did you get them?
I can't believe that you saw her before me.
Oh well, gracias El Commandante, gracias. Muy muy.
Oh, nothing much. You know, I went over to Jerry's. Talked to Jerry. Um, could I talk to you for a minute?
Yeah, this is my first time here. (nudges Jerry again)
Watch the arm! Tim, listen, we don't want to bother you, we know you're busy here.
All right, I'm gonna find a guy with a truck. GLC must live on!
Anyway, I was thinking about what you said. About uh, me and Marisa.
(Desperate to get rid of the book) Alright, I, I'll just take fifty. Do - do we have a deal?
Then I see my clothes floating out there. The tied took them out, not the kids.
All I know is I've been going to doctors all my life. What has it gotten me? I'm thirty-three years old. I haven't outgrown the problems of puberty, I'm already facing the problems of old age. I completely skipped healthy adulthood. I went from having orgasms immediately to taking forever. You could do your taxes in the time it takes me to have an orgasm. I've never had a normal, medium orgasm.
Elaine, when a woman makes a Ball Entrance.. she twirls.
I should be in a place like this. I envy this woman. Ya' get to wear slippers all day. Friends visit. They pity you. Pity is very underrated. I like it it's good. Plus they give you those word association tests. I love those.
All right. So let me ask you a question. Who was the man in the cape?
You would not believe what just happened. I was waiting for you and this woman was sitting at the counter.
You haven't won. You may think you've won, but you haven't won. Do you know why? It's not over. This is not over. I'm not forgetting what's happening here. You have my ten dollars. I will get it back. Alright, don't worry. It's not over. I'm going now. Good bye. I will be back.
Hey, you know, there's this secretary at work that always had a crush on me.
Well, if I hear you correctly--and I think that I do--my advice to you is to finish your meal, pay your check, leave here, and never mention this to anyone again.
Ah, I guess I should go up and apologize.
Oh, this isn't even B.O.! This is *beyond* B.O.! It's *B*.B.O.!
Oh, no, no, not at all. No, I have always felt that the most important thing in the world is spending time with family.
Oh, its a lovely song. (singing) How do you solve a problem like Maria?...
I, I couldn't help but notice that uh you don't have a chair.
I'm unbelievable at spelling last names. Give me a last name.
I told them I have a place in the Hamptons. What did you say?
Yes, Id like to report a problem with one of your mechanics.
But Mr. Steinbrenner, how can I be expected to perform my job properly, knowing that my uh, subordinate is making more money than I am? With all due respect sir, it's outta whack.
(Pleading) Please, please, they're gonna hit me! (Attempts to grab Helen's purse, she starts hitting George defensively, he backs off)
You just gave them to him two days ago, he's gotta give you a grace period.
(sad) Yeah! Yeah. Hey--hey you, you know.. Maybe I'll call you sometime.
I don't care. Look, Lloyd doesn't know what he's up against. This is nothing to me. (moving his arm) My whole life is a lie.
Excuse me. Can I talk to you for a second there, Watkins?
Yeah. (Noticing this makes him out to be the bad kid, he gets defensive) Well, I couldn't run over there the way I was!
I'm interviewing all these annoying little overachievers.. finally, this kid walks in - Steven Koren - a regular guy.. likes sports.. watches T.V..
Hunh, pph (raises hands slightly, in amazement) How was it?
(frustrated) No. No, no, no. You're not helping me.
(???), we'll see you in a little while.
She put them in her pocketbook. I guess she took them with her.
I have to have my tonsils taken out.
I think you're right. You gonna eat that?
It's one think to not give me the extension But to tease and to torture me like this. There's no call for that.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. You can't say anything. (rushes to take phone from Jerry)
Well the sex was okay, but I threw up from the Hennigans.
Do you hold the neck together with one hand, or are you just letting it flap in the breeze?
Hey, grown-up. (they both chuckle, George notices Gwen enter the room) Oh my god, there she is. Go ahead, go ahead. (to the others) Let's go, let's go. All right what are they saying?
We'll have 2 slices and 2 grape sodas.
You're luscious. You're ravishing. I would give up red meat just to get a glimpse of you in a bra. Im terribly sorry. (both George and the attractive female applicant stand up as George reaches across the desk and shakes her hand for coming in)
No, that's right, I didn't. I take full responsibility for the card not being here. I, uh, . . .
(Silently squinches his mouth and nods at Kramer)
No, I'm not. I would like to be, but I'm not. What am I gonna do? The book club meets in a few days.
Pay phone in L.A., look it's a miracle.
I can't believe you called me a chucker. No way I'm a chucker, I do not chuck, never chucked, never have chucked, never will chuck, no chuck!
So what?! She still gave you advice; what's the difference if she's not Chinese?!?!
Oh my God...You're in jail? (Celia nods.) That is so cool!
One mile from the exit it starts shaking, really violently shaking, like it's having a nervous breakdown. It completely stopped dead.
(Yelling out) It's my apartment, Eldridge! The Stalkholm may not have sunk ya, but I will! Ha, ha, ha!
(cheerful) Alright, there you go. She's gonna get the jacket back. (claps hands) So, let's go get some coffee, huh?
She made a big breakfast every Sunday. I don't know what she put in those eggs.
Yes, of course I'm taking Allison. This woman is genetically engineered to go to a ball. Tall, blonde, lithe--
It's like I'm Neil Armstrong. I turn around for a sip of Tang and you jump out first.
I didn't know whether to try and keep her from falling, or zip up.
Hey! Wow, the K-Man! (They walk into the kitchen inside)
(singing) Master of the house/Doling out the charm/Ready with a handshake and an open...
So what, they don?t have another plane? She couldn't take a bus?
Maybe we could call them and ask them to return it.
Well, it's less than twenty-four hours, so I guess I have to!
Why don't they have salsa on the table?
Ade, ahh, ahh, ah ... Im giving you a raise!
Dollar Eighty-Nine. Why is this a dollar eighty-nine? Why is there no haggling in this country?
I'm sorry about that lock on the liquor cabinet. The combination musta just flown outta my head. It's a mental block.
It's "ooh" As in "ooh ooh ah ah."
Why? Why? 'Cause he's off his rocker! That's why.
Okay, uh, eighteen dollars, and there it is. There you go. So maybe we could get together this weekend.
Aha. Aha. Could it be because you don't want him to know that you have a friend who pees in the shower, is that it?!
Alright, stop it Kramer, you're freakin' me out. (The waitress comes over.)
You remember my cousin Rhisa? I'm gonna date her.
Hey, thanks. I owe you a big one.
No, no, not really. Ever since Susan passed on, I have good days and bad. (Turns the briefcase towards the woman on his left.) Some days, I'm haunted by one word - why. Why Susan? Why wasn't it me licking those invitations? Why am I still here? Well, I gotta run. (Gets up and leaves the meeting.)
Great. Jerry, I gotta tell you, I had the BEST TIME with that Nina last night. I - I think I'm in love with her already. You are a great friend. (Hugs Jerry) A great, great friend.
I'll pay you for your time....I just ..I just need some information . How much do you want? ten....fifteen? You have change for twenty?
But I digress. Let me see, now. You were standing at one end of the line and I was right next to you. And I remember we were even for like, the first five yards and then , BOOM,...You were gone.
(gleeful, to Estelle) You did?! That's Goood! That's very good! I'm very glad to hear that.
I'm not stable? I'm like a rock. I take these glasses off, you can't tell the difference between me and a rock. I put these glasses on a rock. You know what jumps into most people's minds? Costanza!
I never assisted in a birth before. Its really quite disgusting.
Well what would be the point of that?
If there's any doubt, I do a leave-behind. Keys, gloves, scarf -- I go back to her place to pick it up...(pop sound) date number two.
All right, relax, tough guy. I got to go out to my father's garage, help him sell some computers.
Yeah, yeah. I see the irony. All right. What about this? What if I can find some way to break up with her so that she'll still like me and it doesn't affect the deal.
What are you talking about.. I WANT MY CAR!!
Well, he is. I, uh, I live around the corner.
She stole twenty dollars from me. (getting angry) Yeah, I might've gotten it back, but Lloyd Braun interfered!
Aw, come on. I wanna go see him.
Oh, yeah. You wish you had this coat.
I was jumping over a puddle, and for some reason I went like this. (George stretches out his arms in a ballet motion) And they called me a Mary. So I chased them, and I tripped and I fell.
With the orange hair, and the big clown shirt with the ruffles...
(looking at the door) He's starin' at us.
Hey, I work for Kruger Industrial Smoothing "We don't care, and it shows."
No, no no. That skips a generation. The baldness gene comes from your grandfather.
That's... what we used to call him in high school, the exterminator. He's a linebacker. Oh, did we have some wild times.
It's two completely different sounds. "ih" and "eh".
Come on. Come check out my new place. It'll take you two minutes.
No, no, Hey I'll get it. What's in the BIG salad?
Take it off. You're going to ruin it.
Kramer, I, I, I, uh, I need to talk to Jerry privately.
So, um, you've read "The Big Game", have you?
George, don't make me get tough with you. Whu, hu, hu, hu huuuu (raises arms) Who says that? She is really cool. What do you think? You think she likes me?
Really? (Realizes) Well, you don't think it had anything to do with what I said, do you?
I got scared there for a second. The Knicks without Ewing.
Hey! Great plane! Thanks a lot. Piece of junk. You know you almost got us killed!
Alright. Uh, well, I'm out of here. (Gets up to leave)
Hu-Yeah, interest. It's an amazing thing. You make money without doing anything...
No, I, uh, um, wa, wa, What did I do? ... Where are you going?
You don't understand, there's a *blurb* about me in this magazine!
Alright. I guess I just have to pick myself up, dust myself off, and throw myself right back down again!
Huh, strawberries, anyone? (eats a strawberry) Ah, that's good. Ooh, juicy this time of year.
And she'll still see it, you're not stopping her from seeing it.
Excuse me...huh... I think I made a big mistake. I'd like my deposit back please.
Kramer, what the hell are you talking about?
Right. I don't have it on me. Allison, this is Susan. Susan, Allison.
He's with the touring company of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. He's the guy in charge of the wigs.
You know what I think? I bet she stole a tractor.
You know it must be impossible for a Spanish person to order seltzer and not get salsa. (Angry) "I wanted seltzer, not salsa."
There's a hundred different things here. What's the difference between these two? (They each grab a box and check the ingredients) You got propylparabin?
Eh eh eh, can't do it, can't do it, sorry, I got a date.
I dont know, 120, 130Then they sent some guys to sandblast for 6 hours. Tomorrow they are putting in asbestos.
Alright, so I haven't put anything in it since sixth grade, I completely forgot about it. The State Controller's Office tracks me down. The interest has accumulated to 1,900 dollars. 1,900 dollars! They're sending me a cheque!
No, I dont want it. I want it, if you dont want it.
You're considering hiring me for your latex salesman.
(Starting to panic again) What? Oh my God. What? Is it meningitis? Scoliosis? Lupis?! Is it Lupis?!
Yeah. I did some shopping. Some new clothes shopping. (turns to a man) Can I borrow your menu?
I don't understand what the big deal is. They let you try on pants.
You told her? How could you tell her? I told you not to say anything.
(Quick, excited talking) Hey, hey! You can't believe this. Look at this check! (Hands it to Jerry) They told me I had the most beautiful hands they'd ever seen in their lives - except for this McKigney guy - this great looking girl gave me her phone number.. I got it! I got it all! I'm busting. Jerry, I'm busting!
Well why don't you get a hold of it and change what you don't like.
It's not really a mental institution. It's more like a depression clinic. She went out to Woodhaven and checked herself in. I'm, I'm sick over this.
Every time we go out to eat the minute we we're done eating she's runnin to the bathroom.
Well...maybe not as much as this bastard... (points at Zeke, they all laugh) I can hold my own! (they all continue laughing and drinking)
When I find that guy, this much I vow those glasses will be returned to their rightful owner.
Hey, listen don't oversleep. You can't afford to be late again.
Is this the ticket holders line, or the buyers?
There was a woman, Audrey. She had a very big nose.
Elaine, can I just explain something to you very privately here? Susan and I have been together many, many times now, and just between you and me, there's really no big surprises here, so...make-up sex is all that I have left.
Oh No nonono I'm not a cop ...Heum... I work for the Yankees.
I think I could be a philanthropist. a kick ass philanthropist! I would have all this money, and people would love me. Then they would come to me.. and beg! And if I felt like it, I would help them out. And then they would owe me big time! (Thinking to himself) .. First thing I'm gonna need is a driver..
So, anyway, what's uh, what's the status with, uh...
My father had a car salesman buddy. He was gonna fix him up real nice. Next thing I know, Im gettin dropped of in a Le Car with a fabric sunroof. All the kids are shoutin at me, "Hey, Le George! Bonjour, Le George! Lets stuff Le George in Le Locker!"
(sitting down next to Jerry) Seeing Maura. Apparently, I was unable to break up beyond a reasonable doubt.
It's all your fault! You and Elaine! All that orgasm talk. She did have an orgasm, she didn't have an orgasm. Orgasm this, orgasm that. I got so focused on it. I started to panic and boom, I lost it. I tried everything, I was talking to him 'Please wake up, do something.'
Mulva! (again pointing finger at Jerry -- Kramer watches the exchange back and forth)
Let me show you something, take a look at this... (Another guy at the party interrupts.)
Well, maybe so...but it was good enough for Mr. Jon Voight.
No, Im saying, if a situation arose in which you didnt want it, I might take it.
(to Jerry) Whos going to play left field?
Would you stop that please. Would you just stop that?
Oh ah, I uh, will have that for you by after lunch.
The Chinese have done it my friend. The Chinese have done it.
What did you go out with me for?! Just to dump chocolate on my shirt and then just dump me altogether?! I don't deserve that kind of treatment! What, you don't have the common courtesy to return my calls?! To apologize! You think I'm some sort of a loser, that likes to be abused and ignored?! Who's shirt can be ruined without financial restitution?! Some sort of a masochist who enjoys being humiliated? You think you can avoid me like I have some sort of disease?! You have the disease! You have the disease! You may be beautiful and rich and physically .. just .. unbelievable, but you sicken me! You disgust me! You and everyone like you!
No! No! Turn it off! No feats of strength! (Gets up and starts running out of the coffee shop) I hate Festivus!
(angry, to himself) The ocean called. Running outta shrimp. Outta shrimp! (a thought occurs) Oh! Yes! That's what I shoulda said! (frustrated shout) Dammit!
Oh come on? No come on. She took off her hat and there she was (waving his hand over his head) hello. It was like I was looking at myself in the mirror.
Yes, Im Sorry, it's a new coat. It-it's Gore-Tex.
Okay. (They walk around each other.) OK. Ill choose you. Whaddaya want?
How could it still smell after all that?
(Losing it) Don't tell me how to eat!
Yeah, yeah. You must have squirted a piece of pulp in it too.
Cops. I don't even care about cops. I wanna see more garbage men. It's much more important. All I wanna see are garbage trucks, garbage cans and garbage men. You're never gonna stop crime, we should at least be clean.
My car's totaled. It's all his fault and now, he has absolutely no money. There is no way that he can pay me. So the judge decrees that he becomes my butler.
All right. There's nothing to be worried about. She's just a little annoyed right now. Tomorrow I'll personally go over there. I'll apologize. I'll get the papers. Don't worry. Don't worry. (exits)
So concerned was he, that word of his poor tennis skills might leak out, he chose to offer you his wife as some sort of mediaeval sexual payola?
Time like what? I'm hungry. My stomach doesn't know that Kramer's wanted.
I just popped in now. I'm a big pop-in guy.
I'm a man. Jerry, I'm a man. And do you know why? It's because of that talk we had. You were my inspiration. Do you believe it? You. That lunch was the defining moment of my life.
We get to go to the opera together!
(shouting) How d'you not like Soda?! It's bubbly, it's refreshing!
Slippery Pete, Kramer tells me you are one hell of a rogue electrician. And shlomo, you're the best truck driver.
(pulls a face) I find it disorienting. Who buys an umbrella anyway? Y..you get 'em for free in the coffee shop in the metal cans.
How many people does he do that for?
You got hookers turning tricks in my car. How's that for starters.
I suppose he's an attractive man, I ,
No, no, I don't think I'm special. My mother always said I'm not special.
We'll ask him. (opens partition) My dear fellow, where are you dropping us?
(gasping) I think I swallowed a fly! I swallowed a fly! What do I do? (He turns to a coffee shop patron at the counter.) What can happen?!
(Sincerely) Thank you.. I, uh.. that might not work out.
You know, you could've just given me Neil's number. You..you didn't have to take me out to dinner.
So, what's happening with the TV show? You come up with anything?
Actually, I never had any formal training. I guess I'd be better suited for improvs, or something..
(adamant) It's smart. It's a smart line, and a smart crowd will appreciate it. (shouting) And, I'm not gonna dumb it down for some bonehead mass audience!
I told you, he probably went out the back.
Yes, the surprise blindfold greeting. That wasnt in the manual, I dont know.
Alright that's it. (George walks across the room over to them.) So you get rid of me and now the two of you are going to sleep together?
Ah hah. You see Father, Im Im incredibly anxious to become a member. Um, dont you offer any kind of an express conversion? A quick change?
He's extremely Murphy. He's Murphy to a fault.
The cashier is at lunch - which is where Id like to be.
(upset) I *told* you the Drake was bad! I hate the Drake!
Really? I never heard of a semi (the "i" sounds like an "e") tractor-trailer. (Jerry nods in agreement)
huh Kramer it's huh.. gonna be pretty dangerous up there
Are you kidding? I lie every second of the day. My whole life is a sham!
You know, this is very nice, but I really could take a cab. Really.
Yeah, there was a fire in my apartment.
Oh, she's got the hue. So, what's going on with you and Melanie? I mean, I know you're not getting married, but uh, things are happening?
That condom killed me. Why do they have to make the wrappers on those things so hard to open?
Yes, she wants me to like her, if she likes me. But she doesnt like me!
I don't know, I don't know, you'll think of something.
Yeah, two for the 715 of Novaj pravas (?). What you're wearing the green sweater?
Oh, that's the worst part of it. He looks just like me.
Yes! 860,000. I can't believe it's still standing. No one has beaten me in like 10 years.
Well, this is the Jerry Seinfeld that only I know. I can't believe I just told you that.
All right. That's enough for today. You're tired. Get some sleep. I'll see you first thing in the morning.
Forget it? I already called my parents. I told them to expect the surprise of a lifetime. My mothers making her roasted potatoes!
This is like a Penthouse letter...Why can't I meet women like this?
George Costanza. Susan's, uh, friend? Long time no speak.
Shes a pig. The woman's a pig, what wrong with her--
Don't you believe me? It's their fiftieth anniversary. You know this is gonna kill him. You're aware of that. Kill him. On the biggest night of his life...
WAIT ,WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!!!!.... Where was the tape recorder?
Maybe he was going to say "Of course I have to check with my associates."
Here. (panicky) We'll leave it here for you!
Dad, the hinges are all rusted here. That's why the wind keeps blowing the door off.
O.k....(is about to explain. Cut to Jerry on-stage.)
(whistles disapprovingly) Ho ho ho, Had to? Had to come in?
Why does everything have to be 'us'? Is there no 'me' left? Why can't there be some things just for me? Is that so selfish?
Well, I got just the thing to cheer you up. A computer! Huh? We can check porn, and stock quotes.
If we could just harness this power and use it for our own personal gain, there'd be no stopping us.
(frantic by now) SHUT UP,SHUT UP, SHUT UP,...(then leaves)
Ya-see, how could this not have any fat? It's too good.
I'm not paying $500 for this! It's a piece of junk!
Uh, Carol, can I talk to you for a second? Right now?
Hey could you do one other thing for me?
I'm not going to break a hundred on this thing.
Stop it! It's nothing. It's a stupid holiday my father invented. It doesn't exist!
What are you talking about? How can you sit there and look me in the eye and tell that me you're not worried?! Don't you have any *sense*?!! Don't you have a brain!? Are you so completely senile that you don't know what you're talkin about Anymore!!?!
Alrighty. Ah ... my last job was in publishing ... I uh got fired for having sex in my office with the cleaning woman.
I thought the thing you said about the sex not being simulated . That was really funny.
She hasn't seen the article! When she sees it, she's gonna think-- *I'm out baby*!! I'm out!!!!!
And then, then, then she leaves with somebody else! Never even, never even said goodbye! Never called me back.. Never apologized. Nothing. Like I was dirt.
Alright, then. We've gotten to the bottom of that.
Oh, there's better, (pointing at the row in front of them) right there, that's better.
No, they're not funny at all. No, I have no funny friends. I'm the funny one. El Clowno.
Hey, Buck. Talk to you for a second?
How could that piece of *crap* cost $98.00!?
Hey, I am not here for rage. I'm here for revenge.
Hey, look at this. This is the same massage chair we're gettin' for Joe Mayo, $60 cheaper.
Who's going to bomb you. An airline for all the stupid little peanut jokes.
She said she liked me. No kiddin' she said that?
Lloyd Braun? What d'you have to meet him for?
Flying him in? How longs he staying for?
Fine. Excellent. Could you do me a favor? Could you not tuck the blankets in? 'Cause I can't sleep all tucked in.
I've tried. We don't have it. But maybe the two of us, working together at full capacity, could do the job of one normal man.
Yes. You know the uh flood, and the uh lepers, and the commandments and all that.
Because, if you ever see her and it comes up, we have to be in sync. Hmm?
It was fantastic, Jerry. We wound up talking all night.
Nose. (chuckles) What's the worst that can happen to a nose? What does it get? Stuffed? (chuckles)
Im the judge and the jury, pal. And the verdict is guilty!
I spilled some Chardonnay. So, what did you get?
Split it. Pretty good. Talk about game six?
No everything is *not* going good. I'm very uncomfortable. I have no power. I mean, why should she have the upper hand. *Once* in my life I would like the upper hand. I have no hand-- no hand at all. She has the hand; I have *no* hand...
I know what you were trying to do. Nobody does it better than me.
She's too tanned. It's the middle of the winter, she's like a carrot.
Yeah, it's being framed right now. I don't even know what it costs. (beat) Not, uh, too expensive, is it?
Listen Jerry. With all due respect, Bania's voice is the voice of a new generation. My generation.
I don't know. I do know that I have some kind of a talent - something to offer. I just don't know what it is yet!
You're telling me. (he walks around and the suit makes a swooshing sound) So, what do you think?
My whole life has been a complete waste of time, (chuckle)
Does Neil like to eat a big breakfast?
Awright, listen, can you uh, gimme a lift back to my place?
You know what I do at the Yankees, when one of these old guys is breathing down my neck?
[as if the word were totally foreign] My `stub'?
Going to need a little more coffee here.
Y'know there are tribes in Indonesia where if you keep your coat on in somebody's house, the families go to war!
But really, it's enough with the bar already.
(explaining, with lots of hand gestures) Okay, look. We've never worked together on a lie. Now, you don't understand how I work. I have a certain way of working. Jerry and I have worked together a few times. He knows how I work. It's not a personal thing, y'know? We're just trying to come up with the best possible lie. That's what this is all about.
Reilly is no longer with the club. (getting up) You believe that?
Oh, he'll be here. By the way, Elaine, (reaches under the table and brings out a large coffee machine) thank you for laying out for the Arabian mocha java.
Well, I can see that. What do you have to do that for? Who cares about your pants size?
Were having lunch with a friend. He works in the building.
Any more grape juice? (Gets up and goes to the kitchen. Remy moves to the end of the couch where George was sitting.)
(to Jerry) It's all white Jerry! It's all white!
You idiots. You're gonna wear down the battery.
(urgent whisper) Elaine! You have got to get me Marisa Tomei's phone number!
I got a date with Karen. I don't know what I'm gonna do. Nothing happening down there.
He probably doesn't want to get chocolate on his fingers. That's the way these society types eat their candy bars.
Of course I'm not Cartwright! Look, why don't you two just go to the movies all by yourselves, I'm not in the mood.
I'm not stealing it. They owe me ten dollars. They stole from me.
Just when I was doing great. I told you God wouldn't let me be successful.
You know, if I could get this Coco woman down to Kruger, they wouldn't be able to call me Koko anymore because Kruger would never allow 2 Kokos.
She doesn't deserve a baby shower. She deserves a baby monsoon. She deserves Rosemary's baby!
Sweet guy (Receives the phone from Beth, Starts to talk to Jerry) Hello
Ever since I found out that you let that message on Jerry's tape recorder I...
(on phone) . It's George Costanza. . are there any messages for me? Why does Mr. Steinbrenner want to see me in his office? . . . Communist? I'm not a Communist . . . . All right, all right. All right, I'll be there. - ( hangs up ) My secretary Ada, told Mr Steinbrenner I'm a Communist Now he wants to see me in his office.
Jerry, my vacation just started. I need a day or two to de-compress. Besides, I did plenty today.
Be careful, you're getting blood all over the car.
She called. He yelled Cartwright. I missed her.
Well, they're more than an underwear to me Mr. Farkus. Two cups in the front, two loops in the back. How do they do it?
Ah. You know, there's gotta be an easier way to open ketchups. They should make it in a tube.
Well you know what happens with larvae hatch, they-they're everywhere.
The next thing you know, he'll have you driving him to the airport..
Of course I'm back. Why wouldn't I be back? My mother's in the hospital, I'm going to pay her a visit.
If she doesnt show up, we cant possibly have dinner with him alone.
No not vast (he pronounces it as "vost")
(checking the fridge) No Chinese leftovers. George is gettin' suspicious.
So, what? We're gonna do nothing now, this is crazy.
Still, I bet when they gave him a plane, it was a lot nicer than this one.
Beautiful women. You know they could get away with murder. You never she any of them lift anything over three pounds. They get whatever they want whenever they want it. You can't stop them.
Well hello. Um, ah, specifically the reason that I'm here, uh, I don't know uh what Elaine told you but uh I broke up with my girlfriend a couple of weeks ago. Actually she broke up with me [struggling with his coat zipper] and uh, well, I was the cause of it and uh, I just wanted to find out from you ... What's with this thing?
You don't think you can buy the ticket yourself...? No, there, there...you sit, and I'll purchase the ticket for you.
I tell you something. I wish there were pig-men. You get a few of these pig-men walking around suddenly I'm looking a whole lot better. Then if somebody wants to fix me up at least they could say, "Hey he's no pig-man!"
Hi Beth (Scene Ends then re-begins with Beth and George on Beth's couch) Um anyway Jerry told me that uh.. it might have been my comment in the Coffee Shop that broke you up.
All right. You wanna know what one of her favorite expressions is? Happy, Pappy?
I tell you, when she threw that toupee out the window, it was the best thing that ever happened to me. I feel like my old self again. Totally inadequate, completely insecure, paranoid, neurotic, it's a pleasure.
(dials) Hi, are you OK? no, no,.. huh, (hangs up) She hung up.
You told him? What did you tell him?
Years. When we were kids, they made it seem like it was right around the corner.
You saw him. He was fiddling with the engine. God knows what he did there.
Are you kidding me? [Elaine walks past the window glancing in] This is the best tool we have today of measuring a persons' intelligence.
No, she left. Listen, you can't mention any of this to Elaine. Cynthia will kill me, we made a deal.
What's so hard about that? How am I supposed to get it in there? I can't just walk in with it. I have to get the Rosses out of the apartment!
Well I didnt do it for my mother.
What about your old car? They couldn't get Kramer's blood out of it?
Have you seen the new addition to the Guggenheim?
Well take a look. It might not even belong to her.
You know, I could have actually gone to that.
Hey, hey, hey! It's not Lupe's fault, you shouldn't have left it out.
There's a bag of Pepperidge Farm cookies up there.
Get out!! (Jerry gets out and George drives away. A couple of guys notice Jerry in his cowboy boots.)
What a fascinating turn of events. (Waitress approaches)
...pianist. A *classical* pianist. She *plays* the piano. She's a *brilliant* woman. I-I-I sat in her living room... She played the *Waldstein Sonata*! The *Waldstein*!
I have tell you, I'm pretty impressed with the first one.
Is there a meal allowance? What about seat assignments? Could I have the Kosher meal? I hear the Kosher meal is good. And I need clothes. Gotta get a haircut. Gonna have to, I have to refill my allergy medication. Oh, do I need a hat? I need a hat, don't I? Could we do the Universal tour? They have that Backdraft exhibit now, that looks very cool to me...
Yes! Yes, I'm the one! Hey! So, you know Jon Voight!
That's a lot of pressure. Make love to me. What am I, in the circus? What if I can't deliver?
Yes, yes, but uh, I have to make a call, so...
I change I change. Two weeks ago I tried a soft boiled egg. Never liked it before. Now I'm dunkin a piece of toast in there and I'm loving it.
Celia broke out of prison. I'm sitting in my home, she shows up at the door!
Oh, it was. But he claimed it was a 5th Avenue bar.
No, no, no, see you're not really listening.
Now, listen closely. I was at the unemployment office and I told them that I was very close to getting a job with Vandelay Industries and I gave them your phone number. So, when now when the phone rings you've got to answer "Vandelay Industries".
Hid? I have no idea how this suit got misplaced. Nevertheless, I do believe I shall purchase it.
I got me an appointment with a hardware store. I'm not saying I want to do it for the rest of my life, but, uh, hardware fascinates me. Don't you love to make a key?
All I know about is sports. That's it. No matter how depressed I get, I could always read the sports section.
Where do you come up with this stuff?
I don't know if you're ready for it.
Well, there's going to be a lot of dentists there.
Ahh! (closes his eyes and rolling his head back) Umh!
Well you know in college they used to call me the little bulldog.
Yeah, well, I guess the only thing I can do is go into George Steinbrenners office and tell him he has to give her a raise.
A few days go by and a call is placed at a time when Sandy is known to be busy at work. Once the initial awkwardness is relieved with a little playful humor, which she [Laura] of course cannot resist, an invitation to a friendly dinner is proffered.
That should be 14, let me just...(corrects it with a pen.)
(Once again, still on the shower) Could it be lukewarm?
how did I know you were here? Something drew me here. This is phenomenal.
What d'you mean, let 'em go? They're spending all my money.
Uh-huh. And how much does the healer charge?
But I mean look at him. He's gotta be on his feet like that all day? That's brutal. I think I'm gonna say something to your uncle.
Come on, wanna give me a hand with the computers?
W--then I'm pretty much where I am now. At least I got to take a ride on a spaceship.
Have you ever given your code to anyone?
Right. The other members of our party. (closes partition) Other members of our party? What other members of our party? I didn't even know we were in a party. Oh, I'm telling you, the jig is up.
(yells) Wow! Who put this cup right on the new table!
I just remembered, th-th-there's this Chinese restaurant out near Yankee Stadium, that puts flyers on all the cars.
What is this 'saving movies' thing? Something's playing, you go.
You can't tell him the truth, you're gonna blow the whole thing.
(sitting) So, guess where Mr 'Ocean phoned' turned up? He's working for Firestone, in Akron, Ohio.
Is-is that what I said 'no story'? Because Jerry had to tell me later.
What did you do here? You took out the wrong guy.
He's giving you furniture? Who is this guy?
That?s-that?s-Harry Fong, he's a very good friend of mine and he's a big opera buff. Enjoy the show there harry!... You know what.
(Thomassoulo helps George get up) Yeah, what the hell.
Yeah. Thanks for, thanks for coming by fellas. Eh, got a set of keys, buried in the pothole.
What are you? Satan? I'm close to a job here. It's my second interview with them.
Hey! Did 'ya ever do that thing on the toes that I said .
Well... we could dance around it a little first.
Maybe it's got something to do with that 42 in the corner .
" That guy was amazing, he could dunk and he was my height...What was his name again?"
All he has to do now is count his blessings, say a prayer, and he's done. Do you believe this?
(Takes a few seconds to mull this one over. Shooting Jerry a confused look, he repeats it) "The panties your mother laid out for you"? (Jerry nods) What does that mean?
It's OK. It's fine. She'll do it. I'm sure she'll still do it.
They got a billion people over there and he found a relative.
Today. Im going today. Just dont do anything until you hear from me.
You go in the living room. I'll take the test in here.
The man in the cape--I bet you he is mixed up in this! I don't trust men in capes.
Yeeeaaah. (Jerry and George lean in to make their conversation a little more private) Well..... I've never really felt confident in uh..... one particular aspect.
See, I knew it. I knew this was gonna happen...
Oh, what are you, like, a Quaker now?
here Elaine here, Superman (hands a comic book to Elaine, who passes it to Tony) please, next time it will only be the two of us
I haven't even met the fiancee! Whatever! (Leaves for washroom)
(tasting the wine) Excellent. Like I really know what I'm talking about.
(Muttering) Susan has the doll collection.. one of the dolls looks exactly like my mother.. she likes to sleep with it.
On-the-street cell-phone call is the lowest phone call you can make.
(reluctant) Oh that uh, that seems like a lotta trouble.
(Puts nuts into his mouth, and in the process covers his mouth) We bring her to the party, and she can tell me what Gwen is saying about me.
And how does the baldness fit into that plan?
What kind of a sick, demented person wants another person's glasses?
Wha? Did you use those? These are guest soaps! (he grabs the soaps and begins examining them for damage)
(looking at his watch) I really should get going. Y'know, I..I wanna be home in case Neil calls.
(Takes it and throws it out window) Get outta my way!
I know, I know and you know *why* they're moving there?
Oh man! I knew I was gonna love the opera.
Well good, good. Take it off you're going to wear it out already. It's for special occasions this thing.
If I didnt put that floss in my pocket, Id be crawling around her bedroom right now looking for my glasses.
Oh, right! (Shakes her hand) Right! Hey, hey.. I love the floors in here. It's like a gymnasium in here! Try and guard me! (Dribbles an imaginary ball
I suppose if I had suggested Liam Neeson Day, you'd all be patting me on the back.
Of course! Alright, maybe I'll say something to Buck.
(aggravated) Oh, that's not good enough! You don't try and de-sour. You have to sweeten too!
This is not good. This is not good.
Danielle. Where's Neil? (indicating the bed) Is this him?
(chases after her) Wait a minute! You're--now you're getting a divorce because she's from Long Island?!?!
What am I scared of? I'm scared of the same thing that you are, everything! Why don't you just use your own name?
Exactly, but theyre on there  waiting. She said she cant wait to see me, were having dinner tonight. Shes supposed to call me as soon as she gets home.
Oh, I had it perfectly timed out the Grand Central, the Van Wyck! You destroyed my whole timing!
I guarantee you that Moses was a picker. You wander throughh the desert for forty years with that dry air. ... You telling me you're not going to have occasion to clean house a little bit.
They, uh... said you were with some guy who was wearing a cape?...
(reading the tabs) Jerry, yours is eleven dollars.
Alright, now, how are we gonna monitor this thing?
You want my friend to ask his uncle, a man who just lost his wife of 44 years, for a death certificate so that he can save a few bucks on a flight?
The way they make 'em these days, I'll never have to tell her.
Well, I'm sure at some point between the years 800 and 1200--somewhere--there were two women living together.
(realizing he was short changed) I was in the pool! I was in the pool!
I can tell you this. If I am not in front of my house at six-fifteen, when my parents get there, they will put me on an aggravation installment plan that will compound with interest for decades.
Because if there's any doubt at all I...I feel we should cultivate it.
Well, if she keeps horsing around with that tractor--
Well, at least, I'm not carrying a purse.
Sorry? Why sorry? What you got to be sorry about?
(almost gleeful) After Dinkins lost the election, he had a complete nervous breakdown. They had to lock him up.
Aw great. Now the volume knob fell off
(suspicious) They haven't said anything to you, have they?
It says very clearly, 'for your protection, do not give your secret code to anyone.'
I couldn't have breakfast, it was lunchtime! The three hour time difference threw me. I wanted a tuna fish sandwich, they wouldn't serve me tuna fish sandwich, because they were only serving breakfast.
(he thinks a little about it... and as he puts his hand on his knee and gets up) I'm sorry Karen. I know I care for you, but I just can't stand when someone doesn't like me. (he opens the door)
(Runs over to him, not wanting him to leave) What? You're going?
Oh, this guy tried to sneak into my space.
Could I, uh, could I trade you for another dollar?
Me? No, no, I don't, I don't. Doing very well, very well, yep.
I've just met her but I'm very impressed.
I never heard him say anything really funny.
(chuckling to himself) Housewarming gift. (swerving the car to go to the antique stand) All right, we're taking it up a notch!
We're perfect. I timed this out so we would pull up at the terminal *exactly* 17 minutes after their flight is supposed to land. That gives them just enough time to get off the plane, pick up their bags and be walking *out* of the terminal as we roll up. I tell you, it's a thing of beauty. I can not express to you the feeling I get from a perfect airport pickup. (starts looking around) What's going on? What are you doing? The Long Island Expressway? What are you getting on the Long Island Expressway for? Do you know what the traffic will be like? This is a suicide mission!
Pardon me, I went to see your friend Dwayne... there was no discount.
You think she would care about the red dot?
This is my ketchup. I bought this ketchup just so I could have as much as I want.
I tried to tear it from the side, you can't get a good grip here. You gotta do it like a bag of chips.
What am I supposed to get, a bazooka?
I'll tell you what, if pig-man shows up, we'll squeeze him in. I'll see you later.
I don't know. A little thing called Step Nine? Instead of an apology, he was beboppin' and scattin' all over me.
The *bank*? This is *found* money. I want to *parlay* it. I wanna make a big score!
I feel like a huge weights been lifted off my shoulders. I... I... I feel happy! Kramer, I dont know how to thank you!
Did I tell you?! Did I tell you?!
I can't go in there. I can't face the bubble boy.
Did I need that pointed out for me? What is that going to do for me? How does that help me, to see her? I'm trying to live my life. Don't show me that.
No...Why should that make any difference to you?
Thanks. You know this could sound crazy but, what do you think about adding a drawer for - like a blanket?
Why don't we talk about it another time.
Oh I would love that. You think he'd really do it?
(smiling) I'm on a winning ball club, Jerry. They probably wanna pick my brains.
Carol, thats so rude. Please, Im serious, just for a moment, if you wouldnt mind. And then well talk to Jerry.
No, I was just wondering... if you guys, uh, had any gum.
[furious] Good. It's good to be accurate like that.
You want to hear more? The master bedroom opens into the solarium.
And you met her in an antique store! I don't know how you do it!
Lemme see. I can't believe you got these for free. (Looking at the tickets) Row F?!
I, uh, just think it's a little unusual. Two people to sit on one side...and leave the other side empty.
I don't know. I don't wanna be one of those guys.
Oh, *please*! Me? C'mon! That's *great*! Are you kidding? I think thats fan*tastic*! I've always encouraged experimentation! I'm the first guy in the pool! Who do you think you're talking to?
Ha, Yeah right, hang on, Ill ah, Ill get her for you. he, he, he, he. Seriously, what's up?
Who's Bozo? Bozo the Clown, that's who Bozo is. When I was a kid, Bozo the Clown was the clown, bar none.
So, he's keeping the apartment. He doesn't deserve it, though! Even if he did suffer, that was, like, 40 years ago! What has he been doing lately?! I've been suffering for the past 30 years up to and including yesterday!
Yes I look forward to many years of... looking at the triangles. Well, I'll ah, I'll wait for you outside.
You don't? Boy, I think about it a lot. I think about it at my age. Imagine how much I'll be thinkin' about it at your age. All I'll do is keep thinkin' about it until it drives me insane...
My place? NO, no, no. I hate my place. I don't wanna go back to my place.
Would you mind helping me out with some of this stuff?!?
Hey, maybe this cheating thing is what I could use to ditch Maura.
I've had bedroom naked, I've had walk-to-the-bathroom naked... I have never had living-room naked.
Your clothes smell just like Pisano's. There's another Italian place on Jerome. Maybe I can fool him.
I don't know, maybe a safe fell on her head.
"Argh!!..Anyway...Jimmy couldn't be here today so he asked me to fill in for him, and I'm sure that you'll be impressed at what can be accomplished after only a few short days of training.....yeah!"
I'm starving. We should have had lunch first..
What do we have in the fruit department?
For that rent, shed take a bath in the toilet tank if she had to.
The guy that stole my glasses. This time I got 'em! (George follows the man onto the street, dragging the blind man with him) Would you pick it up a little?
Ah, get outta here. The vomiting is much funnier.
You would think that, but either youre born with a sense of humor, or youre not. Its not going to change even if you go from the red sun of Krypton all the way to the yellow sun of the Earth.
Oh, the nose job. I don't know, what did you think?
All right. I'm gonna try givin' them fifty-five dollars each... (to Elaine) What do you think?
You've still got pretty good coverage. Once the enemy advances beyond this perimeter - (points at Kurt's head with a pen) - then you won't be Kurt anymore.
All right, he's letting you in. Thank you! Creep.
