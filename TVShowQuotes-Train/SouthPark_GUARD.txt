Don't yell at me! 

Everyone to the main hall NOW! 

I DON'T KNOW!

Here you go, boys. Keep it short.

Ah ah, nobody goes upstairs.

Good evening, gentlemen.

Do you have any firearms or explosives in the car?

Get the towel home  They will explain everything. Please, hurry! 

You can't go in there!

Alright, freeze! 

Hey, shut up in there! You all agreed to stay quiet!

Excuse me. I'm sorry, I'm afraid this area is off limits

You can't agree by accident. There's a fail-safe built in. Even if you click on "Agree" another little window pops up that says "Are you sure you agree?" and you have to click on "Agree" again.

Go go go go! 

Is anyone other than the two of you traveling in this vehicle?
