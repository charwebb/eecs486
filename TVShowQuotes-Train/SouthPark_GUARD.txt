Who doesn't wanna talk to Funnybot? He's the biggest comedian in the world.
It must have been taken while I was going to the bathroom.
You can't agree by accident. There's a fail-safe built in. Even if you click on "Agree" another little window pops up that says "Are you sure you agree?" and you have to click on "Agree" again.
Is anyone other than the two of you traveling in this vehicle?
All right, but make it quick!  Funnybot is very busy in there coming up with new material! 
Hurry! You must get the towel back to Tynacorp!
Heh whoa-ho! Heh hey! Whoawhoawhoa. Whoahoho. Eheheh. The fuck is this?
I said I'm not buying any God damned CDs today, you got that?! I'm sick of it!
Hey! Romper Stomper! Get up!  You got a visitor! 
Excuse me. I'm sorry, I'm afraid this area is off limits
Hey, shut up in there! You all agreed to stay quiet!
Hey, you can't go up there. Hoohoo, woo! 
Heh! Riiight. Who just agrees to something they don't read? 
Alright, boys. When you drop from the plane, cover and roll. Got it?
Excuse me, Ms. Spears, but your kids are here and they've brought you a squirrel.
Get back! I'm not buying any of your damned CDs!
Alright, I just need to ask you a few questions.
Do you have any firearms or explosives in the car?
