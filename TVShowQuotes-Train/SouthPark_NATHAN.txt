Hey Timmy, it's your friend from camp, Nathan.
Hey Timmy. How is the fundraising for camp going?
I had a handicap way before you got paid to have one!
Let me give you guys a hot news flash: If you want to hurt a crippled kid, you don't break his FUCKING LEGS!
No, you moron. You go under the water and blow that whistle. You can attract sharks right as Jimmy starts to surf.
Uuuh!  AAAH!  No, not the shark again! Not the shark again!
Slow down. I need Timmy to pick up the passenger before we do.
You just take one of these little blue babies  three times a day  and inject this directly into your bloodstream  twice a day before meals.
These are supposed to be men who care about their occupations.
I hate you, Jimmy. I fucking hate you with everything in my entire being.
Oh, whatever you say, Jimmy my friend.  Whatever you say. 
Just imagine it, Mimsy. A whole summer to ourselves to do what we want. It's going to be awesome.  Well well, hello gentlemen. I understand you've taken care of our little problem?
Yes, counselor Steve. I like the fun canoe.
No! That's not what I fucking said!  Goddamnit, now I can't even see! Ow!
Mimsy, you didn't do wha' I told you.
This doesn't make sense. Why would they make us walk this far? We're handicapped. "Turn left at the..." Wait. Waitaminute, what? What the?  Oh fuck! Mimsy! This is the map to the Indian Reservation!
It's very simple, Mimsy. I'm gonna take down Handicar by being an employee who sexually harasses the passengers.
You fucking idiot! You don't blow a shark mating whistle on dry land! You were supposed to blow it-  eh uh uh...
Now listen, everybody. If you're a sheepherder, and there's a snake taking away your sheep, what do you do to the snake?
Timmy. Hello ma'am. Handicar at your service. Climb on in.  So, let me ask you a question. Would you like to see my dick?
Not that fake soft-spoken douchebag that everyone loves! 
This is very difficult, Mom. But um... You know how every year I go to summer camp? Well, I hate it. I hate it and I don't want to go anymore.
Get ready, Mimsy. Blue Team is about to go boom.
That's great. I can't wait for camp this year.  We are doing some fundraising too. Have you heard of my friend Elon Musk from Tesla?
That's great. Summer camp, here we come.  Now kiss your business goodbye, asshole!
Shut up, Mimsssyyy! Just swim in the water where Jimmy is, then blow that whistle.
Come on, Mimsy, we gotta figure out how we're gonna make Handicar a thing of the past.
No, that map leads to the Indian reservation. We switch this with Blue Team's scavenger hunting map, and they'll end up right on the Tardicaca Indian Reservation.
Mimsy! Hel- help, Mimsy!  And I thought a shark was bad. 
Now take the Black Mamba,  Mimsy, and put it in the canoe. I'm gonna go get our team ready.
Mimsy, get out there and demand the ukulele solo. It's our only chance.
His name is Timmy Burch.  And if you don't do something quick, you're all gonna be out of work for good.
Shut up, Mimsssyyy! Just do what I say, and we can make sure Jimmy Valmer gets what's comin' to him.
Listen to me: there is no way that Blue Team is gonna beat Red Team this year at camp. You got that?
Because, stupid, now that we have Blue Team's map we can get their scavenger prize too.
Simple. We're gonna get Jimmy killed by Native Americans.  Here, take this.  It's a fake scavenger hunt map
Miiimmmssssyyyy!  Uh, my name is Nathan. I'm disabled.  AAAAA!
Of course. It's very simple. If you're a sheepherder, and a snake is killing all your sheep, how do you get rid of the snake?
That DOES it! I'm sick and tired of your stupidity, Mimsy! You are the biggest idiot I have ever met! And from now on, if I wanna do something, I'm gonna do it myself!  AAAAAAAA!
I can't stand him, Mimsy. That Jimmy kid makes my fuckin... skin crawl.
Whattaya say, Timmy? A friendly race this Saturday? We'll see you at 9am sharp. 
Aaah! Holy shit, Mimsy! What the hell did you do?!
I won't do it, Mimsy. I won't spend another summer at that stupid camp.
Shut up Mimsyyy!  If you're a sheepherder, and a snake is killing your sheep, all you have to do is prove to the sheep that the snake is a completely inferior entity. 
Listen, you can't possibly handle all this business you're getting. Admit it. You've got more customers than you can handle.
What we need to do, Mimsy, is use a little brainpower to make sure Blue Team can't compete.
Uuuh, it isn't cheap. I've gotta keep vice off my back and secure shipments from overseas.
Goodnight, you son of a bitch!  Mimsy! I told you to put the explosives under Timmy's seat!
Shut up, Mimsyyyy! I'm not gonna spend my summer trapped at that camp with these punch-happy assholes. We gotta find a way to put Handicar out of business, and fast.
He can't just lose the race, he has to get sued and lose the whole business. That's why when he picks up the passemger, I've got a little surprise waiting for him. 
Simple. We're gonna get Jimmy eaten by a shark.  Here, take this.  It's a shark-mating whistle.
So uh, I see you train pretty hard.
I'm sure you could find a lot of interested drivers.
It's simple. If you're a sheepherder and a snake is killing your sheep, you just need to have the snake get sued for sexual misconduct. Now, you find me a female passenger on that app and leave the rest to me.
No, you fucking moron! You kill... the snake! 
What's to understand? I'm telling you I don't want to that stupid camp anymore!
I've got an amazing idea. Why don't you let other people drive Handicars too? Think of all the money you could raise for camp if you expand your business.
Yeah, sure, but these are new. They don't show up in our urine tests.
I've got it, Mimsy. I got a way to win the race and get rid of Jimmy for good.
Just someone who doesn't like to see hard workers like yourselves lose their jobs. That's all.
Not just any snake, Mimsy. It's a black mamba.
Simple, Mimsy,  We're gonna put a little surprise in the canoe.
Hey, how would you like to have a friendly little race? It would be great publicity for your fundraising and for ours.
