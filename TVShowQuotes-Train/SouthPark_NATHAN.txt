It's simple. If you're a sheepherder and a snake is killing your sheep, you just need to have the snake get sued for sexual misconduct. Now, you find me a female passenger on that app and leave the rest to me.

Yes, counselor Steve. I like the fun canoe.

Yeah, sure, but these are new. They don't show up in our urine tests.

Hey, how would you like to have a friendly little race? It would be great publicity for your fundraising and for ours.

Just imagine it, Mimsy. A whole summer to ourselves to do what we want. It's going to be awesome.  Well well, hello gentlemen. I understand you've taken care of our little problem?

Now listen, everybody. If you're a sheepherder, and there's a snake taking away your sheep, what do you do to the snake?

I had a handicap way before you got paid to have one!

Get ready, Mimsy. Blue Team is about to go boom.

Let me give you guys a hot news flash: If you want to hurt a crippled kid, you don't break his FUCKING LEGS!

You're gonna need it, you fuckin' asshole.

Listen, you can't possibly handle all this business you're getting. Admit it. You've got more customers than you can handle.

Uh oh!

Dammit dammit!

I can't stand him, Mimsy. That Jimmy kid makes my fuckin... skin crawl.

That's great. I can't wait for camp this year.  We are doing some fundraising too. Have you heard of my friend Elon Musk from Tesla?

What we need to do, Mimsy, is use a little brainpower to make sure Blue Team can't compete.

Yes, Counselor Steve. We like the tug-of-waaarr.

I finally got it, Mimsy. I got a way we can get rid of Jimmy once and for all.

You just take one of these little blue babies  three times a day  and inject this directly into your bloodstream  twice a day before meals.

I won't do it, Mimsy. I won't spend another summer at that stupid camp.

Yeeeah!

Aaah! Holy shit, Mimsy! What the hell did you do?!

Shut up, Mimsssyyy! Just swim in the water where Jimmy is, then blow that whistle.

Good luck, Jimmy.

Yeah I like to sleep at nighttime.

Shut up, Mimsssyyy!

Mimsy, get out there and demand the ukulele solo. It's our only chance.

I'm sure you could find a lot of interested drivers.

Shut up... Mimsssyyy. 

Yes, Counselor Steve. I like a scavenger hunt.  Alright Mimsy, now you take this map to the Indian Reservation, and you switch it with Blue Team's map. You got that, Mims? You switch the map! Switch! The map!

Mimsssyyy! You idio', wha' are you doin'?

Listen to me: there is no way that Blue Team is gonna beat Red Team this year at camp. You got that?

No! That's not what I fucking said!  Goddamnit, now I can't even see! Ow!

Simple, Mimsy,  We're gonna put a little surprise in the canoe.

These are supposed to be men who care about their occupations.

He can't just lose the race, he has to get sued and lose the whole business. That's why when he picks up the passemger, I've got a little surprise waiting for him. 

Uuuh, it isn't cheap. I've gotta keep vice off my back and secure shipments from overseas.

Shut up, Mimsyyyy! I'm not gonna spend my summer trapped at that camp with these punch-happy assholes. We gotta find a way to put Handicar out of business, and fast.

Not that fake soft-spoken douchebag that everyone loves! 

Mimsy! Hel- help, Mimsy!  And I thought a shark was bad. 

Not in our canoe, Mimsy!

Mimsy, you didn't do wha' I told you.

You fucking idiot! You don't blow a shark mating whistle on dry land! You were supposed to blow it-  eh uh uh...

Hey Timmy. How is the fundraising for camp going?

Oh! Aah! Mimsy!

Oh boy, that's great-wait, you what??

Mimsssyyy! Get this thing off of meee!

Uuuh!  AAAH!  No, not the shark again! Not the shark again!

I've got it, Mimsy. I got a way to win the race and get rid of Jimmy for good.

Shut up Mimsyyy!

Timmy. Hello ma'am. Handicar at your service. Climb on in.  So, let me ask you a question. Would you like to see my dick?

Miiimmmssssyyyy!  Uh, my name is Nathan. I'm disabled.  AAAAA!

Because, stupid, now that we have Blue Team's map we can get their scavenger prize too.

Oh, whatever you say, Jimmy my friend.  Whatever you say. 

I finally got it, Mimsy. I got a way we can kill Jimmy and beat the Blue Team.

Shut up! 

Goodnight, you son of a bitch!  Mimsy! I told you to put the explosives under Timmy's seat!

Simple. We're gonna get Jimmy killed by Native Americans.  Here, take this.  It's a fake scavenger hunt map

Shut up Mimsyyy!  If you're a sheepherder, and a snake is killing your sheep, all you have to do is prove to the sheep that the snake is a completely inferior entity. 

His name is Timmy Burch.  And if you don't do something quick, you're all gonna be out of work for good.

That's it! Handicar has the passenger! We're almost in range! Another hundred feet!  Wait a minute. What the hell are all those cars?  Holy shit! 

So uh, I see you train pretty hard.

I've got an amazing idea. Why don't you let other people drive Handicars too? Think of all the money you could raise for camp if you expand your business.

You are.

It's very simple, Mimsy. I'm gonna take down Handicar by being an employee who sexually harasses the passengers.

Whattaya say, Timmy? A friendly race this Saturday? We'll see you at 9am sharp. 

Handicar. 

Hey Jimmy.

That DOES it! I'm sick and tired of your stupidity, Mimsy! You are the biggest idiot I have ever met! And from now on, if I wanna do something, I'm gonna do it myself!  AAAAAAAA!

That's great. Summer camp, here we come.  Now kiss your business goodbye, asshole!

How can people be so ineffectual, Mimsy?

Of course. It's very simple. If you're a sheepherder, and a snake is killing all your sheep, how do you get rid of the snake?

No! I don't wanna go to camp!

Hey Timmy, it's your friend from camp, Nathan.

Shh-shh. 

Come on, Mimsy, we gotta figure out how we're gonna make Handicar a thing of the past.

You know. Steroids.

Now take the Black Mamba,  Mimsy, and put it in the canoe. I'm gonna go get our team ready.

Wait!  Wait, Mom? Can we talk?

Weeell uh, maybe I can help you out. You know, there are shortcuts.

Shut up, Mimsssyyy! Just do what I say, and we can make sure Jimmy Valmer gets what's comin' to him.

Yes, Counselor Steve. The beach is warm. 

This is very difficult, Mom. But um... You know how every year I go to summer camp? Well, I hate it. I hate it and I don't want to go anymore.

No, you fucking moron! You kill... the snake! 

Shut up, Mimsyyyy!

Shut up, Mimsssyyy!

This doesn't make sense. Why would they make us walk this far? We're handicapped. "Turn left at the..." Wait. Waitaminute, what? What the?  Oh fuck! Mimsy! This is the map to the Indian Reservation!

No, you moron. You go under the water and blow that whistle. You can attract sharks right as Jimmy starts to surf.

Simple. We're gonna get Jimmy eaten by a shark.  Here, take this.  It's a shark-mating whistle.

I hate you, Jimmy. I fucking hate you with everything in my entire being.
