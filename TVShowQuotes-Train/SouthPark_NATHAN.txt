This doesn't make sense. Why would they make us walk this far? We're handicapped. "Turn left at the..." Wait. Waitaminute, what? What the?  Oh fuck! Mimsy! This is the map to the Indian Reservation!
No, you fucking moron! You kill... the snake! 
I finally got it, Mimsy. I got a way we can get rid of Jimmy once and for all.
Now take the Black Mamba,  Mimsy, and put it in the canoe. I'm gonna go get our team ready.
Simple, Mimsy,  We're gonna put a little surprise in the canoe.
Uuuh!  AAAH!  No, not the shark again! Not the shark again!
No! That's not what I fucking said!  Goddamnit, now I can't even see! Ow!
What's to understand? I'm telling you I don't want to that stupid camp anymore!
I finally got it, Mimsy. I got a way we can kill Jimmy and beat the Blue Team.
He can't just lose the race, he has to get sued and lose the whole business. That's why when he picks up the passemger, I've got a little surprise waiting for him. 
Goodnight, you son of a bitch!  Mimsy! I told you to put the explosives under Timmy's seat!
Mimsy, you didn't do wha' I told you.
Just someone who doesn't like to see hard workers like yourselves lose their jobs. That's all.
I had a handicap way before you got paid to have one!
Shut up Mimsyyy!  If you're a sheepherder, and a snake is killing your sheep, all you have to do is prove to the sheep that the snake is a completely inferior entity. 
Uuuh, it isn't cheap. I've gotta keep vice off my back and secure shipments from overseas.
I'm sure you could find a lot of interested drivers.
Because, stupid, now that we have Blue Team's map we can get their scavenger prize too.
I can't stand him, Mimsy. That Jimmy kid makes my fuckin... skin crawl.
Yes, Counselor Steve. I like a scavenger hunt.  Alright Mimsy, now you take this map to the Indian Reservation, and you switch it with Blue Team's map. You got that, Mims? You switch the map! Switch! The map!
Listen to me: there is no way that Blue Team is gonna beat Red Team this year at camp. You got that?
Let me give you guys a hot news flash: If you want to hurt a crippled kid, you don't break his FUCKING LEGS!
Listen, you can't possibly handle all this business you're getting. Admit it. You've got more customers than you can handle.
Shut up, Mimsyyyy! I'm not gonna spend my summer trapped at that camp with these punch-happy assholes. We gotta find a way to put Handicar out of business, and fast.
His name is Timmy Burch.  And if you don't do something quick, you're all gonna be out of work for good.
Just imagine it, Mimsy. A whole summer to ourselves to do what we want. It's going to be awesome.  Well well, hello gentlemen. I understand you've taken care of our little problem?
Shut up, Mimsssyyy! Just swim in the water where Jimmy is, then blow that whistle.
Oh, whatever you say, Jimmy my friend.  Whatever you say. 
You fucking idiot! You don't blow a shark mating whistle on dry land! You were supposed to blow it-  eh uh uh...
Hey Timmy, it's your friend from camp, Nathan.
I've got it, Mimsy. I got a way to win the race and get rid of Jimmy for good.
So uh, I see you train pretty hard.
Of course. It's very simple. If you're a sheepherder, and a snake is killing all your sheep, how do you get rid of the snake?
Yes, counselor Steve. I like the fun canoe.
Mimsy! Hel- help, Mimsy!  And I thought a shark was bad. 
Not just any snake, Mimsy. It's a black mamba.
I won't do it, Mimsy. I won't spend another summer at that stupid camp.
Simple. We're gonna get Jimmy killed by Native Americans.  Here, take this.  It's a fake scavenger hunt map
These are supposed to be men who care about their occupations.
It's simple. If you're a sheepherder and a snake is killing your sheep, you just need to have the snake get sued for sexual misconduct. Now, you find me a female passenger on that app and leave the rest to me.
Slow down. I need Timmy to pick up the passenger before we do.
Miiimmmssssyyyy!  Uh, my name is Nathan. I'm disabled.  AAAAA!
Whattaya say, Timmy? A friendly race this Saturday? We'll see you at 9am sharp. 
We hate camp, Mimsy. The singing, the competitions, Jimmy Valmer getting all the chicks.
Weeell uh, maybe I can help you out. You know, there are shortcuts.
Simple. We're gonna get Jimmy eaten by a shark.  Here, take this.  It's a shark-mating whistle.
Shut up, Mimsssyyy! Just do what I say, and we can make sure Jimmy Valmer gets what's comin' to him.
No, you moron. You go under the water and blow that whistle. You can attract sharks right as Jimmy starts to surf.
That's great. Summer camp, here we come.  Now kiss your business goodbye, asshole!
Timmy. Hello ma'am. Handicar at your service. Climb on in.  So, let me ask you a question. Would you like to see my dick?
You just take one of these little blue babies  three times a day  and inject this directly into your bloodstream  twice a day before meals.
That's it! Handicar has the passenger! We're almost in range! Another hundred feet!  Wait a minute. What the hell are all those cars?  Holy shit! 
Hey, how would you like to have a friendly little race? It would be great publicity for your fundraising and for ours.
What we need to do, Mimsy, is use a little brainpower to make sure Blue Team can't compete.
I told you to switch this with the map for the Blue Team!
Mimsy, get out there and demand the ukulele solo. It's our only chance.
This is very difficult, Mom. But um... You know how every year I go to summer camp? Well, I hate it. I hate it and I don't want to go anymore.
Yeah, sure, but these are new. They don't show up in our urine tests.
Come on, Mimsy, we gotta figure out how we're gonna make Handicar a thing of the past.
Not that fake soft-spoken douchebag that everyone loves! 
I've got an amazing idea. Why don't you let other people drive Handicars too? Think of all the money you could raise for camp if you expand your business.
It's very simple, Mimsy. I'm gonna take down Handicar by being an employee who sexually harasses the passengers.
No, that map leads to the Indian reservation. We switch this with Blue Team's scavenger hunting map, and they'll end up right on the Tardicaca Indian Reservation.
