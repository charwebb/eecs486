These are supposed to be men who care about their occupations.
No, that map leads to the Indian reservation. We switch this with Blue Team's scavenger hunting map, and they'll end up right on the Tardicaca Indian Reservation.
That's great. I can't wait for camp this year.  We are doing some fundraising too. Have you heard of my friend Elon Musk from Tesla?
His name is Timmy Burch.  And if you don't do something quick, you're all gonna be out of work for good.
Oh, whatever you say, Jimmy my friend.  Whatever you say. 
I finally got it, Mimsy. I got a way we can get rid of Jimmy once and for all.
Aaah! Holy shit, Mimsy! What the hell did you do?!
Uuuh, it isn't cheap. I've gotta keep vice off my back and secure shipments from overseas.
No, you moron. You go under the water and blow that whistle. You can attract sharks right as Jimmy starts to surf.
No! That's not what I fucking said!  Goddamnit, now I can't even see! Ow!
Listen, you can't possibly handle all this business you're getting. Admit it. You've got more customers than you can handle.
I won't do it, Mimsy. I won't spend another summer at that stupid camp.
What's to understand? I'm telling you I don't want to that stupid camp anymore!
Simple. We're gonna get Jimmy eaten by a shark.  Here, take this.  It's a shark-mating whistle.
Uuuh!  AAAH!  No, not the shark again! Not the shark again!
Miiimmmssssyyyy!  Uh, my name is Nathan. I'm disabled.  AAAAA!
I can't stand him, Mimsy. That Jimmy kid makes my fuckin... skin crawl.
Not that fake soft-spoken douchebag that everyone loves! 
Yes, counselor Steve. I like the fun canoe.
Listen to me: there is no way that Blue Team is gonna beat Red Team this year at camp. You got that?
Hey Timmy, it's your friend from camp, Nathan.
Simple, Mimsy,  We're gonna put a little surprise in the canoe.
Just someone who doesn't like to see hard workers like yourselves lose their jobs. That's all.
I had a handicap way before you got paid to have one!
Hey, how would you like to have a friendly little race? It would be great publicity for your fundraising and for ours.
Mimsy, get out there and demand the ukulele solo. It's our only chance.
It's simple. If you're a sheepherder and a snake is killing your sheep, you just need to have the snake get sued for sexual misconduct. Now, you find me a female passenger on that app and leave the rest to me.
Slow down. I need Timmy to pick up the passenger before we do.
You fucking idiot! You don't blow a shark mating whistle on dry land! You were supposed to blow it-  eh uh uh...
So uh, I see you train pretty hard.
It's very simple, Mimsy. I'm gonna take down Handicar by being an employee who sexually harasses the passengers.
Simple. We're gonna get Jimmy killed by Native Americans.  Here, take this.  It's a fake scavenger hunt map
Goodnight, you son of a bitch!  Mimsy! I told you to put the explosives under Timmy's seat!
We hate camp, Mimsy. The singing, the competitions, Jimmy Valmer getting all the chicks.
Whattaya say, Timmy? A friendly race this Saturday? We'll see you at 9am sharp. 
I told you to switch this with the map for the Blue Team!
He can't just lose the race, he has to get sued and lose the whole business. That's why when he picks up the passemger, I've got a little surprise waiting for him. 
Mimsy! Hel- help, Mimsy!  And I thought a shark was bad. 
Not just any snake, Mimsy. It's a black mamba.
Weeell uh, maybe I can help you out. You know, there are shortcuts.
I hate you, Jimmy. I fucking hate you with everything in my entire being.
Yeah, sure, but these are new. They don't show up in our urine tests.
No, you fucking moron! You kill... the snake! 
Hey Timmy. How is the fundraising for camp going?
Let me give you guys a hot news flash: If you want to hurt a crippled kid, you don't break his FUCKING LEGS!
Mimsy, you didn't do wha' I told you.
Shut up, Mimsssyyy! Just do what I say, and we can make sure Jimmy Valmer gets what's comin' to him.
You just take one of these little blue babies  three times a day  and inject this directly into your bloodstream  twice a day before meals.
I finally got it, Mimsy. I got a way we can kill Jimmy and beat the Blue Team.
Now listen, everybody. If you're a sheepherder, and there's a snake taking away your sheep, what do you do to the snake?
Because, stupid, now that we have Blue Team's map we can get their scavenger prize too.
That's great. Summer camp, here we come.  Now kiss your business goodbye, asshole!
Now take the Black Mamba,  Mimsy, and put it in the canoe. I'm gonna go get our team ready.
What we need to do, Mimsy, is use a little brainpower to make sure Blue Team can't compete.
Shut up, Mimsssyyy! Just swim in the water where Jimmy is, then blow that whistle.
This doesn't make sense. Why would they make us walk this far? We're handicapped. "Turn left at the..." Wait. Waitaminute, what? What the?  Oh fuck! Mimsy! This is the map to the Indian Reservation!
I'm sure you could find a lot of interested drivers.
I've got an amazing idea. Why don't you let other people drive Handicars too? Think of all the money you could raise for camp if you expand your business.
Get ready, Mimsy. Blue Team is about to go boom.
Timmy. Hello ma'am. Handicar at your service. Climb on in.  So, let me ask you a question. Would you like to see my dick?
Yes, Counselor Steve. I like a scavenger hunt.  Alright Mimsy, now you take this map to the Indian Reservation, and you switch it with Blue Team's map. You got that, Mims? You switch the map! Switch! The map!
I've got it, Mimsy. I got a way to win the race and get rid of Jimmy for good.
This is very difficult, Mom. But um... You know how every year I go to summer camp? Well, I hate it. I hate it and I don't want to go anymore.
