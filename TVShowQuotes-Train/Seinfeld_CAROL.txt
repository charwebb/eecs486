Jerry, I can't believe it took you so long to come see the baby. I kept saying to Michael, "When is Jerry going to see the baby?"
Hey! What are you doing here? I thought I was supposed to call you when I got home.
Is she gorgeous? (Elaine and Jerry looking away)
You want some funny material, you oughta come down to where I work, now thats a sitcom!
Elaine. Elaine, did you just see The English Patient?
I just wanted to introduce you to my husband, this is Larry.
Thats what you had to tell me? Your father wears sneakers in the pool?
It's in the bottom draw' of are dressa'. Hurry up!  He's such an idiot.
(taking Blaine's arm) Come on, Blaine. Let's go.
The city's a toilet. When's the last time you saw my little Adam?
So, wadda ya' think? Do you love her?
Isn't he gorgeous? (Elaine looks at baby, only to be frightened and turn away)
Well, let me just check my messages, and well go.
That Ralph Fiennes, I would give up my firstborn for him.
So, uh, thanks for dinner. It was great.
This is George, Elaine and Jerry. These are the guys who got us the apartment.
How are you feeling, Adam? (She sees Elaine in the hall) Elaine! (Elaine enters) This is our pediatrician, Ben Feffa.
Yours were hilarious, we were both cracking up. I just love jokes like that.
So how do you think she looks like?
Okay. Lets go, Im ready, whered you park?
Well, Ill just check my machine and well go.
(to Jerry) Now I know who you are! Youre a comedian. Ive seen you, its driving me crazy.
Let's take a picture. Michael, get the camera.
This is my new next door neighbour, Diane.
...but because it comes out of your baby, it smells good!
Come on, you guys. You can come and see the bay-bee!
A sitcom? Come on, let's go. (They leave)
(from the phone; a recorded message) Hi, its Carol, Ill get back to you.
Look at him, Elaine. How gorgeous is he? I ask you, how gorgeous?
Oh, the baby's crying. I'll go get him. He can sit with us.
The bathrooms on the hall to the right.
Michael, shut the door! You're letting bugs in.
No, nothing here, lets go. (Carol, George and Jerry head for the door. Carol opens it.) Oh, I forgot to tell you. After I talked to you today my neighbour called me and played my messages to me over the phone.
No, what for? Ill just give my bag to the doorman.
Oh well theres a bathroom in the coffee shop just next door.
And he's very particular. Ben, you're staying tonight, right?
