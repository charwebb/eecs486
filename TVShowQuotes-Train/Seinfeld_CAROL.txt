Michael, shut the door! You're letting bugs in.
(confused by his response) So, um, okay.

This is my new next door neighbour, Diane.
Its a dream.

Look at him, Elaine. How gorgeous is he? I ask you, how gorgeous?
...but because it comes out of your baby, it smells good!

Jerry, I can't believe it took you so long to come see the baby. I kept saying to Michael, "When is Jerry going to see the baby?"
No, what for? Ill just give my bag to the doorman.
Goodnight.
Oh well theres a bathroom in the coffee shop just next door.
How are you feeling, Adam? (She sees Elaine in the hall) Elaine! (Elaine enters) This is our pediatrician, Ben Feffa.
Hey! What are you doing here? I thought I was supposed to call you when I got home.
Thats what you had to tell me? Your father wears sneakers in the pool?
