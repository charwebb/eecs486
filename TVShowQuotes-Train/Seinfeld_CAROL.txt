Let's take a picture. Michael, get the camera.
Oh well theres a bathroom in the coffee shop just next door.
(to Diane) These are the guys, who turned this place down, can you believe it? (to Jerry, George and Elaine) Diane gave me the greatest backrub today. Shes a masseuse!
(aloud) You know, I think I will go upstairs. I can check my machine.
Hey! What are you doing here? I thought I was supposed to call you when I got home.
Okay. Lets go, Im ready, whered you park?

Elaine. Elaine, did you just see The English Patient?
Oh, the baby's crying. I'll go get him. He can sit with us.
Well, let me just check my messages, and well go.

Michael, shut the door! You're letting bugs in.
So how do you think she looks like?
This is George, Elaine and Jerry. These are the guys who got us the apartment.
(from the phone; a recorded message) Hi, its Carol, Ill get back to you.
No, nothing here, lets go. (Carol, George and Jerry head for the door. Carol opens it.) Oh, I forgot to tell you. After I talked to you today my neighbour called me and played my messages to me over the phone.

Jerry, I can't believe it took you so long to come see the baby. I kept saying to Michael, "When is Jerry going to see the baby?"
Isn't he gorgeous? (Elaine looks at baby, only to be frightened and turn away)
A sitcom? Come on, let's go. (They leave)
So, Im starving. Where are we gonna eat?
The bathrooms on the hall to the right.
Thats what you had to tell me? Your father wears sneakers in the pool?
Yours were hilarious, we were both cracking up. I just love jokes like that.
