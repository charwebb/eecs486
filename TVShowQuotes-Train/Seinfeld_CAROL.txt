Oh, the baby's crying. I'll go get him. He can sit with us.
Elaine. Elaine, did you just see The English Patient?
How are you feeling, Adam? (She sees Elaine in the hall) Elaine! (Elaine enters) This is our pediatrician, Ben Feffa.
So, uh, thanks for dinner. It was great.
No, nothing here, lets go. (Carol, George and Jerry head for the door. Carol opens it.) Oh, I forgot to tell you. After I talked to you today my neighbour called me and played my messages to me over the phone.
It's in the bottom draw' of are dressa'. Hurry up!  He's such an idiot.
...but because it comes out of your baby, it smells good!
And he's very particular. Ben, you're staying tonight, right?
Adam (the baby's name), Jerry and Elaine are here.
(aloud) You know, I think I will go upstairs. I can check my machine.
Would you like to come upstairs for some coffee?
This is my new next door neighbour, Diane.
The city's a toilet. When's the last time you saw my little Adam?
Is she gorgeous? (Elaine and Jerry looking away)
(taking Blaine's arm) Come on, Blaine. Let's go.
Look at him, Elaine. How gorgeous is he? I ask you, how gorgeous?
(from the phone; a recorded message) Hi, its Carol, Ill get back to you.
So, wadda ya' think? Do you love her?
The bathrooms on the hall to the right.
Thats what you had to tell me? Your father wears sneakers in the pool?
So how do you think she looks like?
A sitcom? Come on, let's go. (They leave)
Well, Ill just check my machine and well go.
Michael, shut the door! You're letting bugs in.
Isn't he gorgeous? (Elaine looks at baby, only to be frightened and turn away)
So, Im starving. Where are we gonna eat?
Oh well theres a bathroom in the coffee shop just next door.
(to Jerry) Now I know who you are! Youre a comedian. Ive seen you, its driving me crazy.
Yours were hilarious, we were both cracking up. I just love jokes like that.
Well, let me just check my messages, and well go.
This is George, Elaine and Jerry. These are the guys who got us the apartment.
No, what for? Ill just give my bag to the doorman.
Let's take a picture. Michael, get the camera.
(to Diane) These are the guys, who turned this place down, can you believe it? (to Jerry, George and Elaine) Diane gave me the greatest backrub today. Shes a masseuse!
Jerry, I can't believe it took you so long to come see the baby. I kept saying to Michael, "When is Jerry going to see the baby?"
Okay. Lets go, Im ready, whered you park?
I just wanted to introduce you to my husband, this is Larry.
