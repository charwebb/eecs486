Elaine. Elaine, did you just see The English Patient?
Come on, you guys. You can come and see the bay-bee!
Isn't he gorgeous? (Elaine looks at baby, only to be frightened and turn away)
Look at him, Elaine. How gorgeous is he? I ask you, how gorgeous?
Michael, shut the door! You're letting bugs in.
I just wanted to introduce you to my husband, this is Larry.
Thats what you had to tell me? Your father wears sneakers in the pool?
Oh, the baby's crying. I'll go get him. He can sit with us.
(taking Blaine's arm) Come on, Blaine. Let's go.
A sitcom? Come on, let's go. (They leave)
Hey! What are you doing here? I thought I was supposed to call you when I got home.
(from the phone; a recorded message) Hi, its Carol, Ill get back to you.
Is she gorgeous? (Elaine and Jerry looking away)
Let's take a picture. Michael, get the camera.
You want some funny material, you oughta come down to where I work, now thats a sitcom!
Okay. Lets go, Im ready, whered you park?
The city's a toilet. When's the last time you saw my little Adam?
(to Diane) These are the guys, who turned this place down, can you believe it? (to Jerry, George and Elaine) Diane gave me the greatest backrub today. Shes a masseuse!
How are you feeling, Adam? (She sees Elaine in the hall) Elaine! (Elaine enters) This is our pediatrician, Ben Feffa.
Would you like to come upstairs for some coffee?
(to Jerry) Now I know who you are! Youre a comedian. Ive seen you, its driving me crazy.
So how do you think she looks like?
This is my new next door neighbour, Diane.
So, uh, thanks for dinner. It was great.
Jerry, I can't believe it took you so long to come see the baby. I kept saying to Michael, "When is Jerry going to see the baby?"
And he's very particular. Ben, you're staying tonight, right?
Well, Ill just check my machine and well go.
It's in the bottom draw' of are dressa'. Hurry up!  He's such an idiot.
That Ralph Fiennes, I would give up my firstborn for him.
...but because it comes out of your baby, it smells good!
No, nothing here, lets go. (Carol, George and Jerry head for the door. Carol opens it.) Oh, I forgot to tell you. After I talked to you today my neighbour called me and played my messages to me over the phone.
Well, let me just check my messages, and well go.
Yours were hilarious, we were both cracking up. I just love jokes like that.
This is George, Elaine and Jerry. These are the guys who got us the apartment.
No, what for? Ill just give my bag to the doorman.
Adam (the baby's name), Jerry and Elaine are here.
The bathrooms on the hall to the right.
