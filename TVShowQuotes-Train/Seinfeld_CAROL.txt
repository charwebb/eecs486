Elaine. Elaine, did you just see The English Patient?
Oh, thats weird.
No, Im fine.
So, uh, thanks for dinner. It was great.
No, nothing here, lets go. (Carol, George and Jerry head for the door. Carol opens it.) Oh, I forgot to tell you. After I talked to you today my neighbour called me and played my messages to me over the phone.
Hey! What are you doing here? I thought I was supposed to call you when I got home.
Let's take a picture. Michael, get the camera.
You do not.
Come on, you guys. You can come and see the bay-bee!
Oh! I have pictures!
Michael, shut the door! You're letting bugs in.
...but because it comes out of your baby, it smells good!
So how do you think she looks like?
The city's a toilet. When's the last time you saw my little Adam?
Whats the rent?
I just wanted to introduce you to my husband, this is Larry.
Is she gorgeous? (Elaine and Jerry looking away)
(from the phone; a recorded message) Hi, its Carol, Ill get back to you.
It's in the bottom draw' of are dressa'. Hurry up!  He's such an idiot.
This is my new next door neighbour, Diane.
What apartment?
Elaine, you gotta have a baby!
(aloud) You know, I think I will go upstairs. I can check my machine.
(taking Blaine's arm) Come on, Blaine. Let's go.
How are you feeling, Adam? (She sees Elaine in the hall) Elaine! (Elaine enters) This is our pediatrician, Ben Feffa.
Oh, thats so sweet.
Hi.
Would you like to come upstairs for some coffee?
George, thanks so much for making breakfast.
Goodnight.
So, Im starving. Where are we gonna eat?
Jerry, well see you there. Bye, Elaine.
Adam (the baby's name), Jerry and Elaine are here.
Well, let me just check my messages, and well go.
And he's very particular. Ben, you're staying tonight, right?
Thats what you had to tell me? Your father wears sneakers in the pool?
I'm gonna get him.
Oh, the baby's crying. I'll go get him. He can sit with us.
Its nice to meet you.
Isn't he gorgeous? (Elaine looks at baby, only to be frightened and turn away)
(to Jerry) Now I know who you are! Youre a comedian. Ive seen you, its driving me crazy.
No, what for? Ill just give my bag to the doorman.
Yours were hilarious, we were both cracking up. I just love jokes like that.
That Ralph Fiennes, I would give up my firstborn for him.
Look at him! Just look at him!
Oh, just look at him!
What? Lyndon Johnson?
Oh well theres a bathroom in the coffee shop just next door.
This is George, Elaine and Jerry. These are the guys who got us the apartment.
Jerry, I can't believe it took you so long to come see the baby. I kept saying to Michael, "When is Jerry going to see the baby?"
A sitcom? Come on, let's go. (They leave)
You want some funny material, you oughta come down to where I work, now thats a sitcom!
Alan?!
Look at him, Elaine. How gorgeous is he? I ask you, how gorgeous?
So, wadda ya' think? Do you love her?
We got plenty of time.
(Entering with baby) Here he is.
The bathrooms on the hall to the right.
Well, Ill just check my machine and well go.
Its a dream.
