Oh well theres a bathroom in the coffee shop just next door.
Come on, you guys. You can come and see the bay-bee!
No, what for? Ill just give my bag to the doorman.
(Entering with baby) Here he is.
Sure.
I'm gonna get him.
How are you feeling, Adam? (She sees Elaine in the hall) Elaine! (Elaine enters) This is our pediatrician, Ben Feffa.
Thats what you had to tell me? Your father wears sneakers in the pool?
Whats the rent?
Hey! What are you doing here? I thought I was supposed to call you when I got home.
You do not.
The bathrooms on the hall to the right.
Diane, Diane, come here.
...but because it comes out of your baby, it smells good!
Alan?!
Isn't he gorgeous? (Elaine looks at baby, only to be frightened and turn away)
Goodnight.
Would you like to come upstairs for some coffee?
Its nice to meet you.
You want some funny material, you oughta come down to where I work, now thats a sitcom!
(to Diane) These are the guys, who turned this place down, can you believe it? (to Jerry, George and Elaine) Diane gave me the greatest backrub today. Shes a masseuse!
(confused by his response) So, um, okay.
So, Im starving. Where are we gonna eat?
So, wadda ya' think? Do you love her?
No, nothing here, lets go. (Carol, George and Jerry head for the door. Carol opens it.) Oh, I forgot to tell you. After I talked to you today my neighbour called me and played my messages to me over the phone.
George, thanks so much for making breakfast.
Yours were hilarious, we were both cracking up. I just love jokes like that.
Well, Ill just check my machine and well go.
Hi.
A sitcom? Come on, let's go. (They leave)
Well they have a phone.
And he's very particular. Ben, you're staying tonight, right?
Jerry, well see you there. Bye, Elaine.
Oh, the baby's crying. I'll go get him. He can sit with us.
Elaine, you gotta have a baby!
Adam (the baby's name), Jerry and Elaine are here.
Well, let me just check my messages, and well go.
Look at him! Just look at him!
The city's a toilet. When's the last time you saw my little Adam?
(to Jerry) Now I know who you are! Youre a comedian. Ive seen you, its driving me crazy.
What apartment?
Is she gorgeous? (Elaine and Jerry looking away)
What? Lyndon Johnson?
This is George, Elaine and Jerry. These are the guys who got us the apartment.
Oh, just look at him!
Its a dream.
We got plenty of time.
I just wanted to introduce you to my husband, this is Larry.
Oh, thats weird.
That Ralph Fiennes, I would give up my firstborn for him.
So, uh, thanks for dinner. It was great.
Elaine. Elaine, did you just see The English Patient?
Jerry, I can't believe it took you so long to come see the baby. I kept saying to Michael, "When is Jerry going to see the baby?"
Look at him, Elaine. How gorgeous is he? I ask you, how gorgeous?
Michael, shut the door! You're letting bugs in.
Oh! I have pictures!
Okay. Lets go, Im ready, whered you park?
This is my new next door neighbour, Diane.
(aloud) You know, I think I will go upstairs. I can check my machine.
No, Im fine.
