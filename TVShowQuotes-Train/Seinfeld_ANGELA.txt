Right?
Beer, lite beer, streamers, orchids. Better lighting?
That's why you're not in charge Meredith.
I'm just leaving for the day.
I bet she does.  I bet she'll eat them right out of your hand with those big strong teeth.
Hello Aunt Shirley.
And now you, two forms of ID, please...  Alright, all is in order.  I just need your signature...  What is it?
You wanna see some pictures? I just got these.
Good evening, Dwight. What is this?
I call it Pam Pong. I count how many times Jim gets up from his desk and goes to reception to talk to you.
How many gods do you have?
What?
Okay. Well, have a good trip. Good luck, Andy.
Per your instructions, we have the personalized M&Ms with the baby names.  This is your boy bowl, with the name 'Chevy.' And this is the girl bowl, with M&Ms with the name 'Astird.'
Please, after the turtle?
And now you all know, but you can never tell. I'm serious.
How do you tell someone it's over?  You send them a notarized letter, right?  Well, what if the recipient is your notary?
Oh, now you can do math? Where were you 2 hours ago 'A Beautiful Mind'-
No.
You need a hair cut.
Pet Day! I want Pet Day back - no dogs.
[Jakey resumes dancing] Uh, no. It���s o���thank you. You know what? You don���t have to���oh no, no, no. No, no, no. It���s okay.
Look, I hate to be 'that' person but I just don't like the general spirit of music.
You already did me.
D, it���s gonna be perfect. The only people that need to be there are you and me.
Alright, let's go, let's go.
No.  Are we supposed to?
What is that?
[ducking under table with Oscar] Oh. Oh.
For breach of contract with Angela Noelle Martin.
Ow!
[grunting] I'm gonna give your aunt a proper bath and a haircut like a lady! And you two are gonna shut up about it! Do you have a bathtub?
Are you married?
[seeing the worker Dwight picked up in the parking lot] Who's this guy by our cars?
What is this?
Nellie is terrific, but to be honest, every day I imagine how happy I'd be if Pam died. [laughter]
It's ok.
Hello, Dwight. I've been thinking about things and I wanted to know if you would have dinner with me tonight?
Yeah, that's a good one.
That was Roy.  She was engaged to Roy.
No.
Phillip?
[laughing] It's a man eating cat food.
I do like it, actually.
She wouldn't do that. She's a Senator.
Everyone put on sunscreen.
Oh, everybody. Oscar found a reason to look on WebMD.
Nobody's named Monday.
I don't want to be married in a tent like a hobo
No thank you, Roy.
Be good.
[singing] I played my drum for Him, parum pum pum pum. I played my best for Him, parum pum pum pum, Rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum.
Don't just say things.
[to Phyllis] Well, I hope you had fun today, because you're never ever throwing a party again.
Such a precious little angel.
[sighs] All right!
Uh!
I think you have me confused with another person.
Great.[Angela walks away]
[Dwight holds the first aid kit up] I'm the safety officer, not you.
Hey everybody, this is my boyfriend, Senator Robert Lipton.
I work with Dwight.
What? Why would they...wait a second, wait a second! What was that? [pauses on her and Dwight leaving the warehouse area where they've just had sex] Oh! I didn't know they were filming then!
Mmhmm.
Honey, say something!
Dwight Schrute! Dwight Kurt Schrute.
You shouldn't joke about that.
No.
OK, I have one. I have one. [Jim's phone rings and he motions he's taking the call elsewhere]
Hi, Dwight.
[while Kevin stares at his cupcake] Kevin, you can do this.
... that has three people...
I don't know if anyone else feels this way and don't get me wrong, I love Michael and Holly, and maybe I'm being overly sensitive, but... the PDA.
I never felt safe here.
[flustered] Well... good for Dwight.
News flash - If you didn't carry it around for nine months, it isn't your kid.
We went to a picnic thrown by the Comptroller's wife.
Cat Heaven is a beautiful place, but you don't get there if you're euthanized.
It's so cold. Even with my coat on.
Put your hands in your pockets.
Kevin, could you not do that?
I wouldn't know, I'm watching my weight. Ugh.
Ok, you go to the store.
Are you sure?
It's a new corporate policy.
Well, I have an alternative.[hands Dwight a document]
No, no, no.
Yeah, I could use some fresh air. Might be fun.
I've already admitted that I do. Why do you keep making me repeat it?
Sounds fun.
Are you allowed to have pets?
Well, I've seen you take enough for the both of us.
How long does it take to get the results?
Jim, we need to order a cake for Creed's birthday.
You sent the late notice to Ryan Heart & Wolf. Right?
Mmhmm.
Dwight!
I normally don't enjoy making people laugh. [grin]
Oh, fine. [puts a napkin on top of everyone else���s hands and reluctantly puts her own hand on the napkin]
[sees Kevin's toupee] Oh my God.
We haven't finished getting things in order from your last visit.
Do not panic.
Is it called red-vining?
You're bad at this too!
I think Andy makes an excellent point.
I know that patience and loyalty are good, and virtuous traits.  But sometimes I just think you need to grow a pair.
[in reference to Oscar being gay] It explains so much.
You think I want people remembering I had sensual relations with Andy? It's the kind of thing you wish you could have annulled. I want to throw up just thinking about it.
Why on earth would you think you were getting a promotion?
I have to hang these.
This is all pathetic.
What, Andy?  Andy, what should I tell them?
Do you think he's signed them yet?
You
Dwight and I have a contractual agreement to procreate five times, plain and simple. And should he develop feelings for me, well, that would be permissible under item 7C, clause 2, so I would not object. [faint smile]
Oscar? What is going on? What was that?
Sometimes, the clothes at GapKids are just too flashy. So I'm forced to go to the American Girl store and order clothes for large colonial dolls.
This sounds ridiculous, I know, but some people say that I eat like a squirrel.
[lights turn off] Really? [jumps to try and activate motion sensor, Kevin walks through the door setting it off, and the lights come back on]
Oscar, how do I describe him. He's like a stapler. Do I need a stapler? Yes. But, I'm still the one that has to push it down.
Yes.
Seven thousand dollars.
I have some ideas about conservation...
Well, it does.  That's me.
[Michael tries to hug Angela] No, no.
Well, it better work.
I have to watch our shoes so they don't get stolen. Who were you texting?
He's gone. It's just a cupcake now.
Oh, for goodness sakes, Kevin. There's no cookie. There's no cookie. Come on. Come.
This place is disgusting. [They smile at each other]
I don't like your tone! Look, they were sold out of all the other costumes, okay? I think we all live in the real world, here. Let's not pretend to be unaware of what sells in this office.
My pastor said it can come from breast feeding.
Well, you just can't start a committee. You have to have funding.
I think we have all the shots we need. Thank you, Dwight.
You have to use chains?
I have a nice comforter and several cozy pillows. I usually read a chapter of a book, and it's lights out by 8:30. That's how I sleep at night!
D?
Attention everyone. Comstock is still available. Oscar has been flirting with adopting him. But still hasn���t given me a definite yes or no.
Sure. Let's protect the convicts. At the expense of the general feeling of safety in the workplace. As a 90-pound female that sits in an ill-lit, rarely-visited corner of the office, naturally I agree with that.
Excuse me? Oh. You're so educated, aren't you Toby?  So trained to deal with a hysterical woman.  I don't want to look at his feet.  [storms off] Do your job!
[Dwight and Angela exiting, he opens door for her] Thank you.
You know, there���s doughnuts in the break room.
And when we get mad, you always ask us if we're on our periods.
Why would you care what the police think of our neighborhood?
Oh. Thanks.
Gray. Dark Gray. Charcoal.
Yes, it is. [Walks up to the counter where there is no employee] Hello?
If you ever wondered if you were Michael Scott, here's a quiz to help. If you ever put sunblock on a window, you might be Michael Scott. [laughter]
I don't know, but standing here's not going to give you the answer.  Go.
Hey.  Do you have any men that you can fix me up with?  I would like to have a relationship with a man.
Andy, what are you doing?
You're ahead.
We both-you didn't dup-
Is this the thing where they use an icicle so there's no evidence?
You're gonna wait here?
Kevin, where are you going?
Right.
The reason I ask is that Andy went to Cornell.
Dwight! Down, Dwight! Dwight!
Sprinkles never hurt a soul. God in your infinite wisdom how could you do this? She wasn't ready. She had so much left to accomplish.
Has she done the pageant circuit?
No, no. I have a fiance I very much like!
I'm a vegetarian. What can I eat?
Bless you.
No.
Decent people everywhere will get offended.
We don't want it to last longer. It's horrible.
It's fake.
I don't approve.  I don't.
Stop it.
What are you doing?
Okay.
What the hell is happening?
Everything ok? [Takes candy from Pam's desk]
They have a nail salon there where I get my feet detailed. [to Meredith] They use a watch repair kit.
Do you plan on raising a child with me? Or do you plan on breaking this contract?
Kevin, you screwed this form up again. The amount owed goes at the top.
Yeah! If I request it he will. And that is that.
How can she make you get back together with her?
Thank you.
So is your place all bachelor-slobby and gross?
Do they even have a bakery anymore?
What is wrong with you? [Dwight pats Angela on the rear and runs away laughing]
Hmm.
Or Mrs. 'Outside Hire.'
Hi.
Mm-Hmm.
Same page. Go to the next one.
Oscar, do you want to be my partner?
I would like to toast someone who isn't here but who will be in just four short months. Welcome to the world, Phillip Lipton!
Would you like to hold Phillip? [hands off Phillip] Yeah. That���s Kevin.
Ow! He pinched me!
Sales take a long time.
Stop it.
Yeah.
What are--- it's... the party planning committee.
Please just take my name off of everything.
Dwight!
[reverently] He is fiercely intelligent.
Those aren't chips and dip.
Kevin, what's four plus seven?
Come on, right now.
We get it.
Okay.
They're Sugarplum fairy wands.
That is a terrible idea. One of your worst.
Yeah, it is, Andy.
I already did.
Can I please leave? I have a rape flute.
I mean, he���s gotten worse over the years���.
Black widow.
We will discuss this later.
Oh, my God, Kevin. I am still on hold. You were supposed to get the answer from Michael and come back up.
Dwight recently entered into a contract with me, establishing intent to conceive and raise a child with me.
No!
So wait, when pies are involved you can suddenly do math in your head?
Sure, sometimes I watch Will and Grace... and I want to throw up.  It's terribly loud.  I do like it sometimes when Harry Connick Jr. is on.  He's so talented.
It's no worry.
Okay, bye.
Okay.
No, the one with the long hair and the denim pants, Comstock! Ok, look [starts playing video on computer]. He���s such a special kitty. I just want to find him a good home. He loves those pants
I will not, it's not-
What?
[looks at Dwight disgustedly and sighs] Even if you do somehow get in, that's not going to make me leave Andy.
What do we do about our heads?
I would like cat.
That is very important to me, so -- I have work to do. Just do it. [walks away]
Thank you, Michael.
[as Andy is passing her a card] No, no!
Oh, god.
And he���s always at the yoga studio. He never misses the noon class - it���s Hot Yoga with Blake.
In mugs with trace amounts of coffee!
You are hereby served with a summons to appear in Lackawanna county court.
That town is full of history!
It's not like we're not gonna see the checks. We're in accounting!
The guys?
God!
No. [Camera pans to down to show her swinging her foot to the music]
I don't like to necessarily touch things. I'm just... I'm shopping.
I hate those two people more than anything in the entire world.
I don't know why I write my name on things.
What did you do to yourself? [camera pans to Jim and Pam laying down in restful location]
Robert, the senator and I wanted to stop by and say hello.
It's a baby game where you guess whose picture is whose.
[whispering] Okay, we should go now. Let���s go.
I actually look forward to performance reviews.  I did the youth beauty pageant circuit.  And I enjoyed that quite a bit.  I really enjoy being judged.  I believe I hold up very well to even severe scrutiny.
I'm not afraid of dying. I know where I'm going. But if I were Kevin, I might be terrified. Gluttony.
Fine. For any interested candidates, I will be conducting 20 minute interviews. My ideal situation would an independently wealthy cute couple with a strong commitment to education. Black or white, I���m fine with either, but not both. [to Pam] Listen, you���re in this, but you need to wow me, ok?
No, don't throw those out!
Oh, right, like I'm responsible 'cause I'm in charge of the party planning committee.
The dream team... and Meredith.
Yes.
Mm-hm.
I got sap on me.
Are we out of jobs?
Okay. I think five plain and one veggie should be fine.
Two, one...
The very best of luck to you, Dwight.
Spring cleaning?
: [walks in] Hello! Hello, my clucking hens. Got room for another in the roost? Huh? Don���t worry, I won���t lay an egg.
Allergies.
Well, that was the last time, Dwight. I mean it.
Ugh. Eww!
Ooo! Who made popcorn? [Michael rubbing butter on his foot]
We are not married.
There's bad blood, jealousies, cliques.
Jedediah.
And then they said the most ridiculous thing about Anderson Cooper, which I do not have the decency to repeat, but trust me when I tell you that-
[meows like a cat, then hisses]
Ok, I wasn't going to dignify this discussion by getting involved, but I don't even get the discussion, hot is a temperature people. But Kevin deserves to lose for what he said, so, yes, she's hot, she's hot as heck, she's a female Boris Becker.
He's blocking me.
Yes and I cheated on you with Dwight, it looks like they got it on film. I didn't tell you about it.
It's supposed to say launch!
I look forward to drug testing. I used to get a runner's high, which is why now I swim.
Six, nine, shut up, Oscar. Eight...
I can't believe you just thought you could replace Sprinkles. Before she's even in the ground.
I'm sure Dwight will protect him.
Yeah!
Really? Oh, Oscar, thank you!
I mean, we just have to see how many Senators and members of Congress want to attend, before we can open it up to regular people. Pam, you know how you and Jim did your ironic wedding? [Pam looks confused] Do you still have the plans for the dream wedding that you couldn't afford?
Email forwards.
I can't do this.
Your body is a temple. You have to respect it. You can't just whore it out.
[walks around Andy's new car keying it]
[crying] It���s just a really nice song.
She just always has to copy anything I do! It's the Ford Taurus situation all over again!
What?
You tried this out, and it's clearly not for you. It's time to go. Come on. [Angela gets up from seat] Please. [Karen gets up and leaves] Thank you. OK, thank you very much. [Angela closes door]
Sure.
I understand.
So you fell in?
This is just offensive.
No.
Michael.
Oh, thanks, Oscar. You���re such an angel.
No, I didn't.
No thank you.
What do you���Dwight! [Dwight cuts her off in his car, they pull over]
Waste of time.
Gosh, I just don't know. Why do you think?
I've already gone up another cup size.  The senator is grossed out. When do you start feeling it kick?
[sees Phyllis; gasps] Oh my God!
Pam, don't tell her what to do! Phyllis.
No.
Murder.
I shredded it.
If you ever called the fire department 'cause your head was stuck in your chair you might be...
What is so funny?
I was.
Anyways, last night he was tired and just wanted a little Mexican brought in. [Kevin laughs]
I'm sorry. I gave this everything I could.
Oh, god, could you just mind your own business?
Elevators.
Were you?
I didn't apologize.
I am proud to announce that there is a new addition to the Martin family. [takes a breath, excitedly] She's hypoallergenic. She doesn't struggle when you try to dress her. She's a third-generation show cat. Her father was in 'Meet the Parents.' Needless to say, she was very, very expensive.
No.
No.
Your hand's in it.
You know, I don't know. We put them all up last night.
Oh.
Just say copies, why do you have to drag cats into this.
[sigh of relief] Well, sorry I'm late. [clears throat, coughs, pulls hairball out of her mouth]
Charles, where were you born?
Fine!  Sit back and do nothing and let us all get fired!
I would very much like that.
I think you've had enough.
Nine, eight, five...
Will you lock the door?
Nosy?
Ohhhh!
Thank you.
I don't take any prescription drugs.
We can talk right here.
No she shouldn't.
No.
Um, you have diabetes, Stanley. [to Nellie] I'm sorry, is the assignment to pick a selfish charity?
I would like cow butter sculpture of a cat.
Stop that! Dwight! Stop that, stop it.
Yeah.
Not here.
That's why we're cursed.
Your screen is all black. You just unplugged your computer.
I don't care, and you won't.
It's ridiculous.
Why wouldn't we come?
[Plays boom box to drown out sound] Alright, how much have you revealed on camera about your relationship with the senator?
No, it really seems like something Michael would do.
So you saw the article on the importance of taking frequent walks while you���re pregnant?
...Okay.
Okay.
What a surprise.
It was just you...
Yes it is.
I'm not sure. Does your karaoke machine have Christmas songs?
I had a chance with Dwight, but I didn't take it. And if I went back now, when I'm broke and he just inherited a farm, I'd be one of those gold-digging tramps you read about that try to bag a farmer.
I have to visit the alchy.
No! Stop it!
I don't want Garbage! I want Sprinkles! [walks away]
Don't go. They eat monkey brains.
This is my big sister Rachel.
Did Michael give you permission to do this?
Ugh.
[on phone] Okay. [hangs up, smiling] How odd, a very unusual phone call from the Senator's office. The Senator wants me to have lunch with him at The Botanical Gardens.
It's really happening!
Listen, I would like you to take me to Andy's play tonight.
No. Porcupines don't have souls. They're like dogs.
Have you seen this? [Hands Pam Parenting magazine]
Yes, yes. He's sleeping.
Thank you.  Sure well first of all I think that we could totally...
The Bible.
That's Phyllis.
Yeah.
Michael.
Good.
My name is Angela.
Are you swallowing them whole?  You're eating them so fast, are they even touching your tongue?
[smiles] Not now. [Dwight leaves] Goodbye, Kelly Kapoor.
[gasps]
Thank you. [sniffles]
If he is your son, that���s a great plan. But he���s not. He���s not your son.
Yes.
Standard, you know? Nothing fancy.
I don't--
All right. Bye, buddy. Bye, bye, bye!
Yes, well, as you know, we get paid on Fridays. And you haven't been here for 12 Fridays. [hands Andy a folder]
Dwight, you have to listen to me! We are not seeing each other anymore! Can you accept that?
No Dwight, I won't- [hoses Dwight]
No, Dwight. The Senator.
No one cares about your birthday. Kevin's waiting to hear if he has skin cancer.
Alleged? I'm going to own your farm by the time this is over.
I agree it's unacceptable. [longing look]
[limo driver lets Angela out of the limo at the office parking lot] Thank you.
[Phillip cries] See the duckie!
You can't go in yet!
Well, for our profit...
Fine.
[as Kevin runs to grab her] What are you doing?
No, that's not. That's next to cleanliness.
Really? [to Dwight] Thank you.
[on phone] Excuse me?  Well, I don't see how that's our fault.  And I've already told you, the official position of Dunder Mifflin is apologetic, so I don't know what you want from me. [hangs up]
[cats meowing in background][on Nanny-Cam] Where is that bad cat? Oh, you know who you are. Excuse me, Petals, I'm looking for Mr. Ash. He's a bad cat. Bad, bad cat. Do you hear me? Bad. Yeah, you were bad. No, you look at me when I talk to you. Do you hear me, Mr. Ash? You look at me. 'Cause I'm talking to you right now.
Really? I feel like this big rhinoceros. Anyway, I wanted to thank you guys for covering for me so I made some treats. I've got brownies and magic cookie bars.
No, the baby. Please, it���s my husband���s favorite cat. He���s broken up about it. It���s the only time I���ve seen him cry other than our wedding night.
Yeah!
: I have been crunching numbers all day. Math is for boys. I need girl talk.
Oh, did you see this report that the zoo got a baby otter? It's on the same site!
That's never the case.
[closing door] I said I didn't want to be on the internet!
Two hundred dollars.
They lost me when they sang ���Monster Mash���. That song obviously glorifies the occult.
Thanks. [knees buckle] Oh. Ouch.
Next year, you should file your stuff in a basket.
Welcome Hannah. You will not be disappointed.
Let's do it.
I can't do it.
[shakes her head disapprovingly]
Well, a lot of good your sorrys are doing her now, Pam. She's a monster.
I'm not going to talk through the fire after your disgusting feet have gone through.
Relax.  You'll get your shot at Jim.  Those two treat the whole office like a 1970's key party.
Can we skip the color commentary and just have Andy go out there and fire her?
Sign.
It'll be fun.
Never.
Don't you dare tank this. [Dwight throws plane far, Angela fake throws and drops her plane]
No, it wasn���t.
Yes, he is.
There.
Well, let me be clear. I only speak for myself, and not myself and the Senator. I think we have some wonderful candidates, and there's a great, lively debate here, but let's think about-
No, I'm not.
[banging on window] I don���t get the point of this stupid window!
Lunch party?  It's supposed to say launch party!  What is wrong with you?
No, you don't have to. I'm going to wear this cover.
Dwight?
Why are you doing this to Andy?
I'm sorry... that you're both morons.
[sighs]
You could out-sell Michael any day.
What if they deserved it?
There should be some ..
I could see enjoying that.
Gah.
When he comes home in the morning, he has this secret little smile.
Why?
The man is wearing sandals.  I don't need to see Oscar's toes at work.  Gross!  I mean he looks like he just got off the boat.
Or, we can prove them wrong. Let's prove them wrong.
Goodie.
Yeah.
I will leave your toothbrush on top of your tire tomorrow morning. [gets up and leaves restaurant]
This is an amazing prize. I mean, I don't even want to give Pam a compliment, because she's so blegh, but she did a good job. I really want that coupon book.
What?
I can't do this. I can't be with you. Every time I look in your eyes I see Sprinkles' stiff lifeless body.
Thanks.
Uh-huh.
Yes... [whispering] but don't expect any cookie.
Oh my god!
You saw it?  Describe it please.
Fine, God. Philip was conceived nine months ago.
How many squares of toilet paper go around the waist?
A little bit.
[grabs cake] Oh. Thank you.
I care!
[gasps] I���ve heard of this - dog style. Oh wait. Oh look Oscar, Thumbelina has a boyfriend! And he has a ponytail - ew. I���d like to see that run for office. Oscar, you were right. I had nothing to be worried about. Thank you. Let���s go.
Yeah, it is.  So I hope you two are very happy together.  Pervert.
How would you support the cat? What are your ambitions?
Wait a second, who designed this spread? The sweets and savories are all mixed together. This is mayhem!
No, it's ah...
I don't know. I mean, we were together, and then he killed sprinkles, and then we stopped, and... I don't know exactly when we started up again.
I once reported Oscar to the INS.  Turns out he's clean, but I'm glad I did it.
[quietly] Let me think about it... I, um... there... [Andy looks over to see everyone watching them]
No! [Kelly chases Angela through parking lot]
You can't have it [takes back toy] I don't walk into your house and steal your Hello Kitty backpack.
I said nothing fancy.
Angela. [Michael sticks post-it on Angela's forehead with female genitalia] Michael.
No.
No, I--I think you should make time for it.
Come.
How about, I leave it up?
Michael!
See? This is what happens. You can't let a stray dog into the house.
God!
This should've been up yesterday. [refers to party flyer]
Did you have fun at Benihana's?
Excuse me?
Fine.
Maybe I'll bring my boyfriend. I'll invite him.
[pushes her chair into Dwight's legs] I'm not depressed I'm in grief.
Dry. You look like you were having fun.
[whispering] I think the senator is having an affair.
How is that a bad rumor?
No, no!
I don���t���I don���t know why.
Uhm, these are, okay this is us at the theater. And antiquing! Oh, rollerblading.
I can play.
Are you drunk?
Hey, come inside and talk to me.
Oh my God! She���s so stunningly tiny!  She���s like a petite double zero, for sure. For sure! Holy cow! Look at what they���re doing.
I don't talk about what goes on in the restroom.
I didn't ask you to do it for me.
I'm not going. You did this, not us.
Is there anything you wish you had done differently to avoid cankles?
Oh, what is that?
Um... tall. No, no, uh, nice.
[whispering]
Thanks again, Charles.
It doesn't matter. Fill them out. All of them. Then when you're done, you can watch me shred them.
[quickly] Amen.
Yes.
Oh my God! Dwight!
Phyllis wanted red, I didn't.
Love you! [Oscar hangs up] God.
What about my cherub figurine?
Andy, no. [Andy nods and starts backing away, Kevin giggles]
Okay, well, Nick, we're in a meeting.
Mm-hmm.  I was thinking tonight, we could... read it together.
Stop it Kevin!
The senator and I still have mystery. I'm always waiting to see what he's gonna surprise me with next. [Oscar chokes on his coffee]
I called you morons.
Well then she barfed them up in the freezer and tried to get out.
Sprinkles.
What color do you guys think?
She's been sick for some time. Thank you for asking, no one asks... about Sprinkles.
Maybe that's because some people treat it like their own private Hooters strip club.
What is it?
Mmhm.
You met your commission cap last week. So from here until the end of the fiscal year, your commission will be zero.
I don���t know.
Has anyone seen the first-aid kit? [Dwight holds the kit up] How many times have I told you? I'm the safety officer, not you.
Trust you? The way Pam trusted you to provide for her so she wouldn't have to work?
Rather than spend all day in court, we've decided to settle our dispute using a mediator. It was an option spelled out in our childrearing contract.
Dwight, from sales, was one of the most honorable and efficient employees this company has ever had.
Oh God, what did you do?  I mean, not that I approve of any of it but...
Then I saw flashes. Reporters were there. They always find us. And everyone was crying, even his aide. [camera pans and shows Oscar in disbelief]
Take this thing. [takes off twine ring]
[pulling cat out of filing drawer] It's okay.  Shh shhh.
Yeah.
I am sorry he���s here today but I had���
Something's not right. The vet's doing an autopsy.
Oh! He was dressed like Ronald Reagan! [Slaps Oscar]
Did you try the petting zoo?
Nothing. Should be fun.
Dwight.
Why do you want this cat?
Well, I won't tell if you don't.
Oh, my Lord.
[on phone] It was an unfortunate error.
Excuse me?
No. You need to sign them all.
Oscar, Oscar, will you take him?
Pizza, pizza with mushrooms, pizza without mushrooms, white pizza, steak?
Seven, two...
Well, Andy sent us in here, so which is it?
Yeah, well you didn't know that when you filled out this payroll form.
What?
No you go. Hi honey!
Uh-huh. But I thought she had more time.
I think I'd like to go home now.
Hi.
Judges and juries!
I was disappointed in Dwight today. He showed a weakness that was unbecoming. Even if he did do it for me. I don't need pity and I don't need charity. I have my dignity and that's enough. And as long as I have that, I'll be ok.
[starts sobbing] I love him.
Hey, excuse me! Waitress lady! Hey, where do you think you're going with that? [refers to toy she just took from table]
No.
I'm so glad you could come.
All right, how about we play the game where we guess how big the mother's belly is?
Get out of the car! Get out! Where is he?
Yes, there is a real fire, but it's okay. Everyone got out fine. This is why you practice these things.
This is illegal.
Did Toby approve this?
Shut up.
Maybe.
No, not the senator. I love Dwight.
One of the Stamford people is a criminal?
It could only be you!'  Way to go.
Sometimes I think she holds on to faxes.
I would prefer a public place. See you after work.
Oh, that's Thomas, Robert's aide.
You'll see me in small claims court!
No, I think he came early just so he could wear these. Thank you.
Well, we could talk about an ethical dilemma I���m having.
I think green is kind of whoreish.
Very much. How's your meat?
Thank you, Stan. Oh, honey. [Stan��closes limo door]��Look, I just want our life to get back to normal. Ribbon cuttings, charity balls.
Why?
A coworker of mine is drinking caffeine while pregnant, and I don���t know if I should call social services about it.
He needs to go right now, and you're his emergency contact.  I think that you should go with him.
You know, I never misbehaved in front of my father because he was a very strict disciplinarian. I can only hope my mate has some of those same qualities [makes eye contact with Dwight].
What is it called when two men intertwine their penises like the snakes on the medic-alert bracelet?
Okay. I don't think Kevin should take his shoes off.
What?
Dwight, you should be running this office.
Alright.  How would you like to celebrate?
I only weigh 82 pounds!  Uh-- save Bandit! [throws cat into air duct and he falls out through the other side] Oh!
Ok, well I'm very sorry about your aunt.
No, no, please. You know, actually, none of you could even really make the cut for this thing. Which I am so sad about.
[Phyllis puts down phone] Hmm hmm. [Phyllis gets up and goes to Angela's party]
Hey. You wanted to see me?
My husband is sponsoring a fundraiser tonight for local dog shelters! Robert California bought two tables for everyone here! These people were lucky to get seats because it is going to be a who's who of the northern 22nd district!
Ok, it's obvious Andy picked the people that are least important to the office.
This is Sprinkles. [holds up a picture] She was my best friend. I kept her going through countless ailments. I asked Dwight Schrute to feed her once, and she is now deceased. This is Halloween last year, [picture of Angela holding Sprinkles] just a couple of kittens [starts to cry] out on the town.
Oh, how the tables have turned. I see you got my e-mail.
What are you-- [people are yelling] What are you doing?
Amen.
I need you to make an announcement that this party is a disaster.
Oh hush. Loose braids reflect a loose character. Now stay still.
Dangerous. Tacky. Sharks. Haunted. No.
What is this?
No, my heels aren't too high. It���s because I spent three hours in a car trunk. Thanks for not locking the door when I asked you to, Phyllis. [sighs] Sorry Phyllis. You didn���t know. As long as I can get to the altar.
Dwight.  Dwight.  I've been doing some very interesting reading.
The glitter is blinding.
That is so unnecessary!
I'm right here.
You know I was thinking...
It's nothing.
He has a 60-acre beet farm that is worth a small fortune.
Hello everyone! Remember little old me. Hi!
Can���t I just agree without putting my hand in?
Good God...
That man he's up against is so dirty. And the senator's just pushing back as hard as he can.
[Kelly runs to parking lot in the rain] Hello, Charles? Charles!
Well are you gonna let go of it? Because part of the blame is definitely on you.
It was excellent.
Lacrosse, the sport?
[waiting for Dwight at their meeting place, slams the door shut]
What?
Phyllis. You're a married woman.
Goodbye.
Oscar, what is happening here? Why would you say you think the senator might be gay?
I knew it!
Go, let's go.
No. No.
Do you have any pastries without fruit?
It was all my fault.
This is from Hooters.
Will you help me put it over there?
OK, we only have three hours people to plan a whole luau, and you're not helping.
Okay, if anything, this is rougher. Stop it Meredith.
Dwight, it���s not that kind of meeting. Put your clothes back on.
Okay.
I hate to even ask because you have been so accommodating about all the wedding stuff.
No Dwight, I don't care if that is how they consolidated power in ancient Rome.
You! [hits Dwight]
We need to know more. Did their shots have sound? What exactly did they get on tape?
How could you do that without telling me?
Thank you. [both laugh]
No.
Are you serious?  This is so offensive.
[giving Kevin numbers for the copier] Four, one, seven, one...
That was interesting. [creaking sound] What was that?
[laughs] Oh, Robert, you're horrible. [to other guests] Simon, Maxine. [sarcastically] Who let you guys in here?
His hair's flipping out on the sides.
It should take no time at all if you put the care into it that you normally do.
I sold Andy's engagement ring on eBay.
These are just my dirty old gardening clothes. They were all that I had in my car.
I would not expect you to know what it's like to date someone in the public arena.
I'm sorry, I was told I had the floor.
Don't encourage him, Dwight.
It is awful.  You've made this day awful!
You know she has it out for him now.
Deep fried Twinkies?  It's gross!
I know. I'm taking them down.
No, it's an invitation.
I hate beet salad.
Little Cici asleep?
It's the nativity scene.
Bologna? I don't eat bologna.
[watching from the conference room] I can't believe they're gonna fight over me.
It's not my fault, I was exposed to Harry Potter.
No. Everything is not okay. The county took my cats.
I love you.
[cutting in] No! Don't!
Thank you.
Really, Pam...
Hey Pam. Would you like to go with me to grab a coffee?
No, I meant... [motions you and me]
Jesus is not your caterer. [baby voice to Cece] But he should be your caterer 'cause you're a little angel. Why didn't your parents get you a caterer? [normal voice] They don't think.
Mm-hmm.
I got this poster for Christmas, and I feel I want to see it everyday. It makes me feel like the babies are the true artists, and God has a really cute sense of humor.
1434-967, paid.
Ok, coming. Hi, baby.
And I lied to you.
Shut up!
I would take The DaVinci Code... so I could burn The DaVinci Code.
Dwight!
Oh, Holly, that is very offensive.
I have to say, I think this is a terrible movie.
Well, he didn���t fight me hard on it.
Uh-huh.
My place tonight. Wear this. [motioning to his new outfit]
You don���t want me at your place.
Nothing, Kevin.
I needed another hour, it could have been done in another hour.
Kelly's not so bad. She really taught me something today [rolls eyes].
What?
I don���t know what you���re talking about.
Meredith, if you don't come to my party, you will be very, very sorry.
I don't know.
Oops.
Of course you do, Jim.  You're a man.  Deangelo is a huge sexist.
Yes, a knee-capping could work.
Don't!
What is this?
Try harder then. [Hannah smashes Nutcracker on top of nut. Sees Kevin take another brownie] Uh uh. No one has seconds until everyone's had some.
This is ridiculous. I... I've spent so much time, like I always do. And for that little trollop to come in here and throw her own party... Are you even listening to me?
I don't know if I want your old college a capella group to be our wedding band.
I don't like it. [Angela leaves]
And what...
You don't know it's going to be okay. Don't give him false hope. ...It's probably nothing, though.
Ok, uhm, then tell him that we'll do this tomorrow night instead.
What are you talking about Michael?
You were supposed to be my friend.
So a child had fallen in?
A nun?
Her name was Sprinkles.
It's fine.
Yes, we'll email you, and then you'll have our addresses.
What!?
Why didn���t you pack the apple snacks?
I have been working on a party for three weeks that just got thrown out the window.  So now I've got to pull together a whole new party, and my useless number two quit, so now there's no one in charge of orchids, chocolates, or the thing that's made of ice.  And my upper back itches, and it's itched all day, and I can't reach it, and Kevin had Greek food for lunch again.
I would like to offer you the dominant male. His name is Ash.
Did you guys figure it out?
How thoughtful.
Oh my god. [All look at camera horrified]
It's a little flashy. I mean, what am I? Naomi Judd?
No! Dwight! Give me the diaper! Dwight!
I do play games. I sing and I dangle things in front of my cats. I play lots of games. Just not at work.
: Robert sent me to take over if Pam fails. If? [laughs]
No, he���s fine.
Ew.
[getting out of her car] Dwight! What the [bleep] is your problem!
All right!
But, I do not understand. If we're such smart adults, then why don't we get raises?
That was more horrifying than Nunsense.
Will you marry me?
Yeah, okay. That���s not what I mean. You don���t have to leave because you said you would. Don���t let pride ruin your whole life. Okay? It���s not worth it.
Kevin! Kevin! Kevin!
Kevin. Kevin! Aaah. Stop it!
Wha? Who gave you that advice?
You're safety partners!
The thought of popping one of your beets into my mouth makes me want to vomit.
You got it.
...and the company has already apologized, so you can take that apology or not. [hangs up] [to Kelly] I think he had Tourette's or something!
Six-seventy, six-twenty.
Pam, we have a great idea.
Okay. Oh, thank you.
Dwight!
[thinks for a moment] I will respect the results of the duel.
It's birthday month. Creed's is today. Oscar's is week after next. Meredith's is at the end of the month. [Jim exhales deeply] Michael usually goes with red and white streamers...
[to everyone in the room] For the record, I have never been involved with anyone at work, in any capacity.
Jan, this is Angela Martin from accounting.
Pay him whatever he wants.
Where have you been?! I've been waiting.
Oscar, use a calculator. [Oscar shakes head]
Oh, it is warm.
It���s too loud.
I lost it. [Phyllis glares at her until Angela pulls out the hairnet and puts it on]
What about me? ���Klokken tre pige���
Do not panic!
I wouldn't put it past her.
That's not happening.
Then what'd he do? [Kelly's phone rings]
[on phone with Robert] We agreed that you wouldn't be seen with him in public. It's humiliating for me. Well, if you get to bring a stud, maybe I do too.
[singing, with Dwight holding up microphone] Little baby, parum pum pum pum. I am a poor boy too, parum pum pum pum. I have no gift to bring, parum pum pum pum. That's fit to give our King, parum pum pum pum..
People red vine.
Yes. Congratulations.
Some of us got both. [raises hand]
You���re a dad!
Is it a big deal? Is it Kevin?
Great, then it doesn't matter.
It's a bonus check. For you. From Wallace. Because the branch exceeded it's targets over the past quarter.
Extension 128.
No I left it on my night table--- your night table, by the lamp.
We can make a difference here.
Andy, was that coordinated by the Cornell Study Abroad Office?
Oh my God.
Nothing for me?
Probably.
He's just trying to push your buttons.
No, you will not.
Oh, now all of a sudden you get picky?
Come on!
It's alright.
Alright, I think I'm trained.
Mmm hmmm.
A Purpose Driven Life.
No, not him, not him. Outside. Outside.
But my biggest concern is that there's only one bathroom.
Okay.  Then how about I'm the head of the Accounting Department, but he only ever talks to Kevin?  What about Pam and Kelly?  Also department heads.  But has he ever met with you or even asked you to do anything?
Sure. [gives Philip to Dwight] Watch the head, watch the head.
Well, this is intimate.
But--
Which one is the instructor? There all fatties.
Hey.
No thank you.
Aw, preemie pajamas!
Look, look, look. Here he comes. Here he comes. What is he doing?
Yeah, shut it, Oscar. Pam?
Phillip is wasted on you. Jim is never gonna take the time to call him Phillip! He doesn't even take the time to get a haircut. And Phil! Ugh! It's just something you do to a hole!
Ow.
What do you hear?
Don't 'Monkey' me! You can't wait to get out of here, A. R. M.
It's like you weren't even at the meeting.
Phillip���s your son.
No.
I knew she'd crack! I wanted to leave you out, you know.
Nothing.  You know this is a luncheon shower.  Girls only.
[gasps]
I find the mystery genre disgusting. I hate being titillated.
Someone put them in my bag.
I don't know what that is, Pam. I made a batch with no nuts, special for you Kevin, right here.
One thirty. [Pam yawns] I'm sorry, are we boring you?
You deserved every bit of it! ��You made my husband gay.
These are for employees only.
My Phillip is crawling.
You don't know them all?
Okay. He took me to the replica of Monet's Japanese bridge, and then he put this flower behind my ear, which normally, I would hate, 'cause it's so civil rightsy. Then he got down on one knee, and he said, will you be a Senator's wife?
No, actually, Dwight, I didn't realize how far this walk was, and I-I'm exhausted.
Whack.
Uh, what? Why? Uh, hi honey. What- how are you doing?
Manure. Get rid of it.
I have no information. But I���m sure as soon as they know, they���ll call you.
They're one per person. [points to sign 'Please take one!!]
[as Nick looks over at her]  What are you looking at?
No! No! You know what? This is not a party-planning committee anymore! And I don't want your foot money, and I feel uncomfortable participating.
Everything.
Ugh.
Because whenever I pack the bag, you say I do it wrong.
You've got to be kidding. {Kevin takes bite of brownie]
Well, whatever Kelly wants to do in her own house is fine but we shouldn't all be subjected to it.
And they���re gone. And I have no one left. Without my cats, I am utterly and completely alone.
[to Kevin] Language.
That's... no...
Niagara Falls? Pregnant? That was your dream? Pork medallions?
[singing] ... Shall I play for you, parum pum pum pum [Oscar and Gil walk through door]
Kelly's training us?
Meaning what?
Do you have a gun?
Is this spicy?
Well, when you have coffee breath-
What are you doing here?
Jammed. This day couldn't get worse. [Kevin laughs]
No, this was years ago when I was living in Ohio.   John Mark and John David.
Yes!
Yes it does!
[Pam puts up another flyer] What is that? [Reads flyer] The 'Committee to Plan Parties invites you to a margarita-karaoke Christmas?' There's no such thing as the 'Committee to Plan Parties.'
Mm-mm
We'll see.
God help you.
Really?
What about the surprise?
And I told Phyllis not to put it out, but she insisted. So, anyway... Hi! Oh, Oscar, remember my husband, the senator?
I'm not gonna lie and say I'm sorry when the company didn't do anything wrong. That's immoral, and this is ridiculous.
How tragic. Very sorry to hear that.
There's no fizz in this punch. Phyllis!
People are dressed inappropriately.
Good afternoon.
Phillip is the name that we're using. It's after my favorite cat.
I've noticed how you look at him at the office.
Why don���t you pack it?
Pam do you think anyone���s going to notice I���ve worn this costume before?  When I wasn���t pregnant.  You know I bet nobody would believe it still fits.
[answering phone] This is Angela. Oh. Hello, Miss Polodnikovski. Uh, how can I help you? Did my rent check not clear? Because I just transferred another $25 to that account. So if there���s a problem it���s clearly on your end. And���oh. Oh. Oh, okay. Good. Then... um��� what is this about? No, no. Hey, hey! No, you are out of line Miss Polodnikovski. No, no you are. No you are! Evicted? Fine! I didn���t want to live in that cesspool anyway! Listen, I get my security deposit back. Yes, I do. This is not fair! That is not fair! Well, you know what? You have so many hairs on your chin that Animal Control should���ve taken you away. That is very unladylike! You are disgusting! [hangs up phone]
I know the timings bad, but I hate to be a nudge, but there's stuff that he has to sign that needs to be mailed by four.
Is just looks bad.
Tonight my party will be broadcast out to five other states.  Which means, it will be compared to Denise Stimm's party in Buffalo.  Any idiot can defrost a microwavable hors d'oeuvres platter.  And Denise proves that with every party she throws.  Oh, and Denise?  Stop telling people your hair's naturally curly.  We all know you get perms.
Really? I don't see it. I mean, he's ok, he's not unattractive, it's. . .
I guess I wouldn't mind a pair of small, well-behaved boys.
And person.
Bye.
Zip it, Meredith.
What the [bleep] is your problem you [bleep] [bleep] [bleep]?!
Dwight! That doesn't count!
Ah!
Oh. Thank you, Kelly [long pause]. And I wish I hadn't called you stupid.
Congratulations, Phyllis. You look lovely. Your dress is very white. So white, my eyes are burning.
You're not going to get my permission on this.
You don't want bugs. You know? Who knows where those bugs will end up?
No. No. Certain events have transpired. And I've thought about certain things. And I'm sorry for the way those certain events transpired. [starts to cry] And I would just like to make some changes about certain things and certain situations.
Under no circumstance should a man strip off his clothes in this office.
Psst. Hey. Erin.
Oh God, Meredith, lice? Did you not sign a pledge to shower?
[kisses Andy passionately in his chair] Now, I have to take care of a legal issue.
No!
Come on, you're safety partners!
No, yeah, I think that's a good idea.
Ugh!
Thank you.
No. I haven't thought of it.
Any problems?
Really? I wouldn't know anything about that, but I'm glad you enjoyed it.
Here you go. And good for you Dwight, I'm so glad you found someone. I bet she's got kind eyes.
It's not my problem. [dials phone]
So you keep a very tidy house.
No.
Why?
[sighs]
No.
Where's my car? Come on.
I find this incredibly offensive.
I have a very important announcement to make... about... your paychecks. Umm... Your paychecks will be arriving as scheduled on Friday. And they will be in the correct amount that they are normally in... Please stand by for a very important announcement... refer..[starts to leave office] for further regarding your paycheck! [runs outside]
Okay.
Fifty.
What?
Nellie you didn't tell us we could win money.
I think your hair is much too long for your age, by the way.
Yes.
Okay.
We think you might kill Robert.
Brownies. Cupcakes. [Kevin walks toward conference room]
That doesn't sound like me.
I look forward to it.
Oh God!
I would watch that.
Paid.
[to Pam] Did you know a baby conceived out of wedlock is still a bastard?
Jan, which one of the new employees is a criminal?
Thank You.
Well, you're lucky you have a grandmother. Some of us have to be our own grandmothers.
That didn't happen.
No. No.
Phyllis, I need you to pick up green streamers at lunch.
Robert! The senator was going to wear dark brown tonight... I'm sure it will be fine.
Amen.
Good point? What is a tub of electricity?
You gave birth in a tub?
Jim. Pam. [gasps, speaks in baby voice] And the precious bundle of God's gift to everything. [back to her normal voice] I wish you both a pleasant day. [baby voice] And you too. Yes. Praise God. Ok.
[Oscar shakes his leg] You're going to have to stop that. [Oscar moves over] I can still feel it.
No! I'm not cleaning up a bunch of uneaten cupcake bottoms! You know, we don't really care about your opinion. You're just a tie-breaker.
Okay, so everything you need to know about the target is in here.
And even if it did, it's just a coincidence.
Have you signed the expense reports yet?
I, barely know him...
Oh!
[on ground] ... Please don't let that stupid thing near me...
Fine! It���s Oscar. So what?
Waste of time.  The website's going to win.
Oscar.
Did you think I stole your baby?
It���s the only thing that will make this right.
Ugh. There is no cookie, Kevin.
Hm-hm. Do you not answer e-mails anymore? Because I've e-mailed you four times asking you to come to my desk.
That's your toast?
I don���t want to sit near any of those people for the next 20 years. Someone say something.
No. No way. I am not a machine, Jim. You can't just change plans willy nilly and expect these little magic party elves to do your bidding. We already have devils food, peach cobbler, Fudgie the Whale, mushroom caps.
Poop is raining from the ceilings. Poop!
Oh, um actually uh, we are just friends.
Babies sleep a lot Pam, if you feed them enough. Brownie Pam?
He���s here.
A dead bird should not be in the kitchen!
Every baby looks just like you. Your face kind of looks like a baby.
Apparently.
What? What is it?
Phyllis.  These are spoooons.  Spoons have rounded tops, and are used to scoop things.  What we need are forks, which have prongs, or tiny spears on top.  And we need knives, which have blades.  Do you understand me now?
I wrote it out.
The party starts in an hour.
What do you want?
As you may know, I am no longer in a relationships. It's been really stressful here. So, I decided to treat myself to one of God's most perfect creations...a beautiful new cat! It's tacky to talk about money. But she cost seven thousand dollars!
By the end of the day? That's impossible.
Was Dwight rooting for me? Hmm. I hadn't noticed.
Thank you.
What? [knock at the door] Okay.
What? What are you saying? Did you say sandwich?
Absolutely not.
Ow!
They���re sleeping with my husband.
Do you have to slaughter on our wedding day?
[flustered] Goodness.
Have you had a chance to look over the revisions on the contract I've prepared for you?
yes!
We're going to have the fluorescent lights flickering. It's gonna make everyone sick.
I know.
Yes. How would you like a nice warm bath?
Last week.
Pam, aren't you going to introduce us to Michael's girlfriend?
Thank you.
Oh, the honeymoon can wait till tomorrow. We wanted to hang out with you guys. I mean, when are we all going to be here together again?
I just needed you to want to marry me because you wanted to marry me.
I knew it. You should see their baby.
I know I haven't made this easy on you. [Dwight comes out of storage room alone, looks at watch.]
I do.
No, stop! Just don't.
[smiles knowingly]
This is my favorite day.
[in the car] Slower. Slower. Meredith. [Michael's cell phone ringing My Humps] Slow it up.
Really? Well, I hope I do.
I said, okay.
[after taking her gum out] Ugh! There's gum on the seat and now it's on my work skirt. I have to go change.
Where?
No. But anything within a five- to eight-mile radius is acceptable.
Completely unacceptable.
I have this crazy thought, that I know is crazy. That maybe Dwight killed my cat.
Is there anything we're missing? Phyllis, you got the lights?
Bye, Meredith.  Here you go.  We got you some balloons.
Watching some of your friends.
...but it's totally inappropriate.
Well���
Stop it!
No, Dwight!
Ugh.
Look, we have a rebate from... the Federal Work Opportunity Program and no one knows what that means.
I am having a child with my husband, the Senator. And Pam is having a child with Jim... the great salesman.
No Star Trek names.
So, can we speak our minds now, or are we still sparing feelings, because I hate all of this.
I know who this is!
You did kill her!?
Excuse me, everyone. Is it OK if I leave early from work today? It's Phillip's first birthday and the senator and I are hosting a party at our house.
Can we just skip to whatever number 5 is - win/win or whatever?
You don't understand.
Honey! What are you doing here?
Meredith, too far!
I've had the worse day here [turns up Nutcracker music on the stereo. [Sighs. Dwight reaches for and holds Angela's hand]
[getting a pill from the bottle] I don't have a headache.  I'm just preparing.
Good morning.
I can't set that kind of precedent. She's a bright girl. She'd see right through that.
No.
The senator and I wanted to wait, but we had just seen Thor and there was way too much wine in my chicken piccata.
Wait, what is this?
I can't, Sprinkles is sick.
It's an experiment.
Dwight has been practicing karate for years. When we were dating, I would help him with his strength training. He would strap me to his chest in a baby Bjorn made for fat children and do lunges across the farm. It felt like I was flying.
Uh... something cool that Ryan doesn't know about yet.
I don't.
Okay.  Bye Charles.  Well you'll let me know.  Good bye.
No Dwight!
You don���t carry it with you?
Sure.
Go-Go dancers?
Come here, come here. Let's go.
Oscar.
Unbelievable!
[approaches Dwight as he leaves] Hey!
You never... you don't like them.
Uh-uh, leave us alone.
You never told us to close them.
I wanted to let you know that Dwight was late that morning because he was driving to New York to drop off the correlated documents that I forgot to send. Though to be fair, Kevin never reminded me.
If you hadn't made us stay, we'd all be home by now.
No, Kevin, no.
Yes! [slaps Mose] Tell me! Tell me where he is! Mose, damn it! Where did he go? Mose! Get back here!
So, he's alive.
That is where we disagree.
[laughing] To remind you that our wedding���s gonna be wonderful.
Cecilia....and Phillip.
Why'd you stop it?
Oh geeze. [Jakey starts dancing on Angela]. Oh, my God!
I will not.
I'm not dating you.
Are you going? [to Dwight]
How did you, um, where did you...
Not now, Kevin. Can���t you see we���re busy? Phillip needs his apple snacks.
No. You know-no!
Dwight, look at my teeth. [shows teeth, beet red]
Fine.
Yeah, instead of Hay Place, it should be pay place. [man laughs] Don't laugh at me.
Thank you.
Voodoo Mama Juju, the witch doctor of the Savannah swamps.  I'm not comfortable with this. [holds up a head]
You are throwing up for the wrong reasons!
I know! It... I was just really hoping we could spend some time together. [A long silence.] Are you still there?
Um, we all chipped in and got you this stroller.
Hmm... [Pam reaches towards vending machine] Excuse me.
Hi.
Let me know.
I heard you. [quickly walks away]
[laughs] We���re very close. We even have our own special language.
Want me to say it again?
[Blows a weak whistle] Party planning cimmittee, emgergency meeting. Now.
What?
Yay! Oh, poor Robert. He won���t get to say goodbye. He has this business dinner tonight
I want you to tell her to stop, Toby. Am I being clear?
Plan a party, Angela.  Oh!  And the entire world will see it.  Oh!  And here's $65.00 for your budget.  Oh and here are four idiots who'll do nothing but weigh you down.  Oh. And your cat's still dead.
Michael, I don't like this game.  It's scary.
I wouldn���t know. I never lived with a gay guy.
Agreed.
It was hand delivered. But, I did get a Save The Date after all. It's not my taste.
I don't care.
Please don���t teach the cat French.
Apparently my station in life has descended to a depth even they won���t forgive. So, hi.
Of course.
[enters smiling and waving] Hello, everyone. Oh, ice cream. Nice, Kevin. Looks good.
Oscar!
My baby is not a monster!
Welcome back.
Oh, my head is killing me. Does anyone have a baby asprin?
It would never work here.
Yeah, uh no.
You're in my way!
He's not weird, he's just individualistic.
It was very nice meeting you, Charles Miner.
I have something better than a picture. Come on.
[to minister] Hello, I'm Angela Martin, and-
Andy, you want us to buy our own paper?
... doing the work that could be done by two.
We really have a lot of work to do right now.
No, not at all.
I'll help you!
Oscar... [sighs] can I ask you a question?
I asked for assorted cutlery and I got back spoons.  These are worthless.
I'm just trying to figure out why you're sabotaging things.
You have to pick an approved, non-profit organization.
[Angela slams phone shut and runs back to office.] Also, I would like to inform you that, um, as a special treat, my party will be starting early. In fact, it will be starting right now [opens door to conference room.]
I think that Dwight is doing this whole thing to, um, get a sample of my baby's DNA to prove he's the father. Which... is impossible... because the senator is the only man I've ever been with.
Pam, my bag was there...
I don't says those kinds of things out loud. It's inappropriate.
Michael, there's no way we can do it in time.
No, no, no. It has to be physical. I want this person to suffer.
I told you [Dwight vomits power drink on Angela]
But we don't keep two sets of books.
I, I need to get to the paper please. [Reaching for overhead bin above Pam, papers fall and Pam has liquid spilled on her]
Yes.
He's hungry.
God!
Ugh! God, I can't. OK, I'll-
Hey.
Dwight?
Yes.
We're not.
No. This is a closed door meeting.
Really Andy? It's Christmas and your singing about nudity and France.
I don't want to blame anyone in particular. I think everyone's to blame.
Oscar.
Yes, Pam. Not everyone is as informal as you and Jim. [imitating Jim's voice] Oh, hey Pam, dude, whatever, wanna marry me? [Erin, Kelly, and Meredith laugh]
My name is Angela and um, I'm in charge of the accounting department. There are three of us, Kevin and Oscar.
No. We heard that about Jim.
Fine. The first lesson we'll teach children will be about obesity.
What happened, exactly?  I wasn't here, so I haven't really heard the whole story.
No. No.
Ow! What are you doing?
Andy?
Stop...
I guess.
No. Thanks. We'd... have to explain everything, it's probably just easier if we do it ourselves.
I didn't get anything for Valentine's Day.
Hey D.
No, no, no, no. I think I just want to go home, but it's okay. This can count as one of your times.
Let���s go Kelly.
Are you enjoying your fiesta?
I won't be watching, and I won't.
[crying] Jazz is stupid! ��I mean, just play the right notes!
Arms at your sides! Arms at your sides!
No you can't baby! [to Dwight, whispers] Good luck.
Yes!
[whispers in Dwight's ear] Outside my car in two minutes.
I knew you were saying sabotage.  I was giving you an example of it. I will misunderstand everything that Andy says until he goes insane.
Yes!
But so far we only have two pictures of him.
I'm not some farm animal. [Dwight smirks at the camera]
I think we're good.
Safety partners.
[to Andy] You may ask me out to dinner. Nothing fancy or foreign, no bars, no patios, no vegetables, and no seafood.
No.
So what are your credentials?
Can I go back to my desk now?
All right, if I have to be the good wife, I���ll be the best damn wife there is. Correction. Best darn wife. Sorry, I���m a better wife than that. [sighs]
I think it's alright. Jesus drank wine. [Pam overhears]
That's enough.
The senator.
I don't like my character.
Kevin, relax.
Oh! [bus tears around corners as group crashes into each other]
No. If you want to punch the punch card, you have to take me to the show.
Well, I looked through all the budgets. And there is one department...
Please.
Michael should have asked the party planning committee first. He's not supposed to just spring things on us out of nowhere. [starts to cry]
Me? Oh, I'm fine. I mean, sure, times are leaner now that I'm separated from the Senator.  But my new studio apartment is just fine [camera shows small cluttered space with excessive cats and Phillip crying] for me.. and Phillip... and Tinky... and Crinklepuss, and Bandit 2, and Pawlick Baggins, and Lady Aragorn and their 10 kittens.
Well, I think it would be immoral for Erin to cheat on Andy.
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.
I guess men find Esther attractive.  I mean if there are chubby chasers, then there are men that like that....thing.
KELLY! You cannot change costumes in the middle of the day! Pam, she's out.
No, that���s not���
But...
OK, it's three forty eight.
Kevin?
I'll take the poster. Some people like these.
He's just....
[coughs for attention]
We are giving money that has been gambled. Why don't we just deal drugs or prostitute ourselves,  and donate that money to charity?
Oh you look so handsome! Very presidential.
I have to go clean up after the party.
[Bandit is chewing on wires] Bandit, No! No no no!
It does!
[walks away]
Good night, Dwight.
Those lumps are cats, and those cats have names, and those names are Ember, Milky Way, Diane, and Lumpy.
I'm a vegetarian.
How is going to be ok, Dwight? Everyone will know our business.
I did not. Uh-uh.
What are you...?
Another clue, another clue.
Two sacks��� worth. Apparently my apartment complex has rules about how many pets are too many for a studio. And while I was out picking Phillip up from daycare, they came. They came into my house.
[in a sing-songy voice] Pam, how's your day going?
Kevin!
Oh, Dwight, just move.
No one said 'you must have two'
Phyllis?
Wait Pam! How did he seem? Like, you know, did he seem disappointed?
[Spits champagne back into her glass]
It���s just his way of saying, ���Thanks for letting me hang out in Accounting.���
What���s going on?
It was not an unpleasant way to spend an afternoon. [They shake hands. Then kiss] Dwight, Dwight.
Oh my God! [Dwight has cut the face off the CPR dummy and put it over his own]
I didn't-
But I don't see how this is my problem.
But he's an idiot!
You two are apes.
What am I supposed to do with this?
Daycare won���t take Phillip anymore.
Chocolates?  Someone famous?
Yes, What are you doing here?
Please. It was easy once I decided I wanted the dog to piss on Gabe.
Pull me up!
Mmhmm.
Don't rush me. I'm grieving.
What do you mean?
Did he not tell you that?
Yes.
[coughs] [sniffles] I am just feeling under the weather. And... I think that I will go home and rest.
Oh my God.
Mm. Yeah, so we can celebrate Thanksgiving-Me-Your-Money Day. [both laugh]
[walking into storage room] Hurry, we have to make this fast.
Just goes to show the power of prayer.
Hey, I'm kind of in the mood for a roll in the hay.
You embarrassed me earlier.
I'm doing it. You know I am. It's disgusting.
Yes, that's the problem.
Bye!
Dwight?
None of them. Especially not Andy.
Dwight, that's awful.
It���s the [bleep] that lives downstairs. She���s this uptight, judgmental shrew. You know the type.
Just put them on! Put on your clothes. I need your help. I need someone who can operate outside of the law. Ugh.
Did you bring your jerky in again?
Thank you. [Puts candy back] I... I don't want those.
Not very worried about downsizing right now. Because, uh, I think you've met Kevin and um...
When I got home, Sprinkles' body was in the freezer where Dwight said he left her, but all my bags of frozen french fries had been clawed to shreds.
Yeah, neither did I.
Kevin, come.
Isn���t it amazing, the difference in our sizes?
He put you right in front of me?
Call him!
Jedediah.
Perfect!
[laughs] We should do it right here in the break room. [they giggle]
What?
It's not a surprise to me. Pam is the office mattress.
[loudly] Stanley, I won't be able to invite everyone to the wedding, because we want to keep it to 350.
No, none���No, stop. It���s just���
Really?
Hey! [Erin sneezing at desk] Are you sick?
[on cell phone to Dwight] I need to know if I can start the party?
[gags]
I'm not gaining anything from this seminar. I'm a professional woman. The head of accounting. I'm in the healthiest relationship of my life. I just think it's insulting that Jan thinks we need this. And, apparently, judging from her outfit, Jan aspires to be a whore.
Who drives like that?
Side salad, chicken piccata on the side.
Cause I was thinking that you should meet my boyfriend, he's a state senator. I really think the two of you would hit it off. He's a great person to know.
In your nose?
We have a buttercream cake and a slideshow of Toby.
These are all terrible ideas and none of them are on the theme of 'A Nutcracker Christmas.' I think you should leave.
Malls are just awful and humiliating. They're just store after store of these horrible salespeople making a big fuss out of an adult shopping in a junior's section. There are petite adults who are sort of... smaller who need to wear... maybe a kids' size 10.
What? Why did you call me out here?
I'm not moving the tree.  Face it. The only power you have over me is this big secret that I know you're not going to tell.  And you want to know how I know that? Because then you won't be able to plan your stupid, tacky parties anymore. So you move the tree.
Kevin, we're out of 11-38 forms. Did you order more?
You're useless.
Thank you.
What does that mean?
The Senator is exhausted. This campaign is wearing him out.
I don't know if you guys have had a chance to use the new parking meters that accept credit cards, but Robert was instrumental in that legislation.
What are you doing?
Yes, it was.
Don't Meredith.
Oh, no.
Dwight, I am not gonna hose your aunt down like some animal.
I said you wouldn't be disappointed. [Meredith heads towards break room.]
[calling in, unseen] I have next meeting!
Call him! [hits Oscar]
Enough Oscar, enough.
Stop it! Gimme that! Give it!
No!
You know what Pam just save it.
Oh, sorry. I thought it was a guess your baby's birth weight pool.
Dwight, we're fine!
No.
This is a cold pack...
Did she look... When you saw her how was she looking?
Call him! Call him!
You're a freak!
There was much more secret filming than I expected. [laughs] But I am fine with it, I mean it. I am.
I don't back down. My sister and I used to be best friends, and we haven't talked in 16 years. Over some disagreement, I don't even remember. So... yeah. I'm pretty good.
Those aren't helpful.
Meet me in the old place, five minutes. I need you.
On it!
Yes.
Fine.
No, now listen. You can't let what you see here, sully your image of them. They are good, decent cats. [all laugh] I gotta go. I'll be back in an hour. Oh, stop that! Oh!
Rude.
Ow! Dwight! Ow!
I came down here to feed the feral cats like I usually do and I found something unsavory in the back of your nephew's car.
Ew! Oh.
There has to be a barn that's old enough that you can see the stars through the roof slats when you lay on your back. And antique tools to look at when you roll over.
Ow!
No.
But you said you were in debt. [crosstalk]
And you know those annoying geese at the park? Well, he's helping eradicate them as well. I mean, I think they've really become a pest.
What?
Uh-huh.
Ugh.
I think we need to figure out what's going on. I might just take a little walk.
Good.
I don't care, but yes.
No.
Yes. And he didn���t like it.
Is there any way our first dance can be to my favorite song, The Little Drummer Boy?
It's outside.
It's not up to Michael, it's Jan's call. Talk to her.
Dwight! Oh my gosh! Dwight!
Well, the way you said it made it sound like he was dead.
There's still an hour.
You always do this! We have a nice, modest party planned, and then you come in and demand the world. Let me be clear. There is simply no money for anything other than a cake and to develop a few more slides... although Toby won't be in them.
Oh... I don't- I don't want any- what are you guys doing here?
Oh my god!
Ahh! Dwight!
The DaVinci Code!
It's Angela and Oscar.
Can you put that down?
Hey!
Thank you.
[Dwight slaps her butt] Hey!
Stop it, Mr. Ash! Bad cat! That is very bad! You stop it right now! I swear, he is fixed.
Have a great day.
[on phone] Where are you from?  Ohio?  That's nice.  So what do you want?  [to Kelly] He's upset about the watermark.
Kevin! Now it's seven-six, or is that too much accounting for you?
Mm-Hmm.
Congratulations Dwight.
I'm the head accountant.
Hey.  Uh-uh.  I cannot control that.  You can't put that in here.
The senator will be joining us later.
What is that?  What is that?
What do you mean by ���poisoned���?
This is a big day for you.
Then roll an eight.
Yeah.
I'm sorry, I didn't realize you were with anyone.  I just wanted to bring you the brochure on that accounting seminar that I was telling you about.  Earlier.
I guess I have.  Huh.
It's after my cat.
Oh, I may have seen it somewhere. [Goes to plant and picks up power cord] Is it this one?
Michael, did you finish yet?
[To Esther] Well, I guess you needed the money more than me huh? Use it wisely.
No. I didn't come down here to get wet and wild. I just need you to sign these.
We're in the pool!
You're welcome. Would you like some stew?
Now. Come on, up here!
It's beautiful.
Absolutely not.
I didn't ask you to scratch it.
Yeah, a $25 gift card, iTunes.
They arrived this morning.
In a general sense.
[whispering] Yes. My heart is so open, I am so at peace. [scoffs] Look at Meredith. She���s disgusting. Those feet. They���re like the paws of an orangutan.
Whoo!
There's a diabetes shot, roll the insulin in your hand, don't shake it. She gets an ace inhibitor with her meal, but you have to put her right in front of the dish or she won't see it because of the cataracts. Mix one capsule of omega fatty acid in with her kidney medicine, um... and you want to give that to her 15 minutes after she's eaten. And, oh and there's a fungal cream because she has this infection under her tail, so you're gonna have to lift her tail and put the cream right at the base of her tail.
Well, wouldn't it feel good to tell him that he was incompetent?
Please stop making me do these things.
Okay, watch it.
Michael...
It's hard.
Okay, but I don't want to be put on a mailing list.
Stop it.
Are you authorized to do this?
You're expanding on your worst idea.
My marriage is in danger. I don���t know who I can trust. I need someone to be there for me.
I don't think that...
Why isn't Jim wet?
No, that is not a party. There's only one party and it's hosted by the Party PLANNING Committee and it starts at three o'clock.
Deangelo, I forget, did you mention you like politics?
It doesn't matter, Michael.
Do you want to give Michael your urine?
I wouldn't subject Robert to that. He's a very busy senator.
Yes.
Have you taken any concrete steps?
What, Pam?
Well, you might be right. But it���s too late now.
Have you read it? Has an adult member of your family read this particular issue?
God! Kevin!
Can you just tell us what we need to do so we can go?
No. No children. Our house is not kid-friendly. Most of our furniture is sharp. Also, ew. It will mostly be campaign donors.
This is how you make this important decision?
Kevin, maybe I should handle that. We really need you to focus on your project.
No seafood.
Dwight, I thought I knew what I wanted. And then, being here with you and the German Mennonite minister... it just all felt right. I made a mistake picking Andy.
Are you sure you don���t want me to drop him off?
Heh.
But it's the season of mercy.
No, I've got it, Phyllis. Stay. Have fun. Eat your wand.
I've seen some of your spreadsheets.
Alright.
Ooh!
Come on, Dwight.
What have you heard?
[out of breath and wet] Charles and Kelly? Absolutely not. He is a sophisticated man. He does not need to go dumpster-diving for companionship, ok?
Shut up.
It's not an office expense.
I'll just have some bread. You used your hands.
[upon seeing Dwight naked] Ugh!
Something made of ice?
Hi.
Okay, yes���yes, I will! [they kiss] I love you!
No. No one wants to see that. [both smile at David]
Just stop moving your calves so much while you're talking.
Because there's a party! A party for the website I've been planning for two weeks.
[sobbing]
Yes, I'm anxious to get off work. But let me be clear. It's not to celebrate St Patrick's Day. It's so I can protest St. Patrick's Day.
No. My doctor wants me to gain weight.
Well then. Have a nice day.
Do you really expect us to believe you're somebody else?
The Finer Things Club was not sanctioned by the Party Planning Committee.  Renegade clubs are dangerous.  I squashed the Weight Loss Buddy Support Group.  They didn't need to gather.  It was just gross.
[sighs] Yes, that's true.
That's great Pam. I like having these little moments with you. You know what? Sprinkles recently had kittens.
[removes post-it, leaves] Uhh!
Is there a key for Jane Doe? Thank you.
No, but some of your outfits are not appr-
Look, it���s a ���Little Pregs��� [points to her belly] and ���Big Pregs��� [points to Pam���s]
I made a vow. I gave my word.
[getting her head checked] Geez Meredith, you know, this is an office not one of your bean bag orgies.
No, it doesn't!
Mm-hmm.
Pssst. I'm having relationship problems. And since you're always having relationship problems, I thought you'd be able to give me some advice.
Exciting news. There's room for one more at my son's birthday event. And, I want you.
So cute.
Rachel, are you all right?
Andy.
Yeah, I can see that.
You put her in my freezer.
Nana Mimi cannot squat over some trench.
I'll give you the leads. But you know what? It's going to cost you some clerical work [hands her a mountain of paperwork]
Okay! Everybody!
Hmm, I liked it.
No.
Something like that.
Yeah. [Oscar shakes his head no]
Charles, I got your memo. Thank you. I want you to know I'm putting my foot down when it comes to expense reports.  Waste not, want not.
Alright, see, you don���t have to leave the door wide open. We get it. It���s the wind. Just come and shut���[Mose grabs Angela and takes her away] OH! My God!
Yes. They don't get 'em, if we don't get 'em!
They don't have this kind of technology at the vet's.  It's not far.
Michael wrote down 'Astird.'
Guh.
Is it any good?
No, I don���t��� no.
It's fine. Pajamas aren't supposed to be baggy, right? It's not the barrio.
Thank you. Don't linger. Break left. Left!
Meredith's allergic to dairy, so...
Great! I think Kelly should attack Toby.
I think the thermostat is acting up again.
Andy, I'm engaged to you. I mean, we just signed off on our wedding flowers. Would I have said yes to formal chrysanthemums if I didn't want to get married? And, we went through all that stuff with our wedding cake...
Yeah. [cats meowing] I mean, I usually try to take leave when I get a new cat, but I'm out of vacation days. And this company still doesn't recognize cat maternity. I mean, when somebody has a kid, oh sure, take off a year.
Michael is going to get us all fired.  You sat back and let him play that dumb movie, and now Jan is peeved off and we're all going to lose our jobs.
What?
Dwight?
I don't think that's appropriate.
Rolph, did you not hear me?
Don't touch me Dwight! [runs off crying]
Sorry! Bye, Andy!
Yes. Don't forget the pipe.
No.
Shh.
With who?
Mmm-hmm. Ok. I'll go with you. Come on.
Hello, Pam.
I do not wanna talk about this.
Don't talk about it.  Office romances are nobody's business but the people involved.
Oh no. [laughs]
Why am I getting all of the bad ones?
Oh, no no no no no. I have not yet begun to shame.
But we signed the contract.
Right. Um, point is, Philip was conceived out of wedlock.
So, what happened?
I have one, yes.
[slaps Dwight's hand away] No. No. I like the baby's hair the way it is.
Dwight.
OK. I'm gonna be at the doll store.
Sparkling cider is very good.
Mm-hmm.  Tales of bravery.
It's nobody's business, Phyllis. Roy.
We can save that.
Mmm-hmm.
It sounds mean.
The vet is removing all of Sprinkles organs right now and sending them to the lab.
Oh, I would love to, but I am swamped... with that [picks up piece of paper].
My worst breakup was actually two breakups.  Two different men. I was in love with both of them and when things went bad they had a duel over me.
He���s always been like that.
Dwight is dating a brussel sprout farmer named Esther.  She's coming here this afternoon with her father.  Who knows? Maybe she'll be pulling the horse cart! [laughs]
It's fabric! I really wanted this.
This friend of mine - let's call her Noelle - she missed this deadline turning something in to Corporate in New York. But then this gallant gentleman - we'll call him Kurt - he drove all the way to New York and handed it in for her. That's... I don't know. I guess he really just likes her a lot.
Kevin, Kevin.
Yes.
What? Well what you say is stupid, and your job is pointless. And you're a slut and everyone thinks so.
I don't know why I'm surprised. Literally nothing you do could surprise me anymore.
Charity.  Bake drive.
God! [kicks Oscar]
Where is it?
I don't think that this is---
I'm not voting.
Three, zero, zero. Again, zero. Four, six...
No one is more thrilled for them than I am...
And I made cookies. Same category.
Come on!
[Michael is wearing a blond wig, talking in a high obnoxious voice] My boyfriend can, he's a state senator.
Oh.
But I don't understand. It's for managers.
What if it's a girl?
[Angela dials the phone] Let's talk about this later. [Dwight's pager buzzes]
Meredith, slow down! We're not gonna get there any faster if we're dead.
You said you would be there for me.
Oh.
And where do you think you're going?
[points at picture on the wall] And that blue busty gal? What's her story?
I feel so stupid. I sit next to him every day.
You let him walk all over you. It's just pathetic.
[into another walkie-talkie] Copy, Possum. What's your twenty?
Can we go? I have a lot of work to do.
Oh! [slaps him again] Stop it! Stop kissing him! Someone needs to call and warn him. This could ruin his career.
It's ridiculous. Did you talk to him?
[as Pam wonders about Jim] Kevin, stop it with that question.
Obviously, this was Kevin. This is his sense of humor exactly.
Hmm.
Cause we come here to do our jobs. We don't stick our noses in other people's business.
Sometimes you talk to us real close.
No.
To my tally, you just won back your own parking spot, a vacation day, and a nice, tidy quarter of $1,000 from all of us.
