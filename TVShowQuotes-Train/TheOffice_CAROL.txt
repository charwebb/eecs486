I better go. Okay, you can find a way home, all right?
I really need a moment alone with you. [Carol heads towards Michael's office.]
[whispering] I���m so sorry. They were an hour late.
Well, ten over thirty, so thirty year total.
He says... 'I love him.' He loves you.
Two years ago with my kids and my ex-husband.
Ten year fixed, over thirty. Thirty year total.
And then, I just need you to sign here at this arrow.
Oh, well, actually, I guess this would be our first date. I guess.
Thanks. Thank you for inviting me. It looks so great in here.
I'm great. I just needed one last signature for your mortgage insurance.
But, um, I don't know how to deal with, with this thing [waves Christmas card]. And, and the proposal. And I don't think things are going to work out with us.
No. See, we never went on a ski trip.
Is this a financial thing? If it's a financial thing, what some people do is they rent out the third bedroom.
Uhh, no, I... don't just sell real estate. Uh, my daughter has a skating lesson.
[wearing cheerleader costume] I thought you said this was a costume party!
Top of your class at business school, and you live on Shady Hill Road, right?
What is this? [Holds up a Christmas photo]
Michael, this is Bill. He's the head of the condo association.
Oh, good, I'm glad. Can I drop it over later?
[louder] Can we talk about this in private?
Can I get a red wine? So, two hours? That's a long drive.
I have to get a sitter, but that shouldn't be a problem.
