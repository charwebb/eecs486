Thanks. Thank you for inviting me. It looks so great in here.
Michael.
I'll see you tonight.
Oh, great.
Can we talk about this in private?
Bye.
Oh, well, actually, I guess this would be our first date. I guess.
What does that mean?
Are we ready to sign some papers?
Hello.
Two years ago with my kids and my ex-husband.
I'm sorry.
Oh, Michael.
Michael...
All right.
Hi, is Michael around here?
[wearing cheerleader costume] I thought you said this was a costume party!
Michael?
This is the ninth date, Michael.
What is this? [Holds up a Christmas photo]
What? Too spicy?
This is so weird.
To the casino thing?
Michael, this is the unit you saw and...
No problemo.
Are you okay?
I'm great. I just needed one last signature for your mortgage insurance.
Sure.
[whispers] What?
The wavy brown hair and blue eyes.
She seems really nice.
And then, I just need you to sign here at this arrow.
What?
And I'll bring the papers, too.
He says... 'I love him.' He loves you.
That's some extra income for you.
Get outta here.
Oh, good, I'm glad. Can I drop it over later?
What?
[on phone] Hello, Michael?
Well, ten over thirty, so thirty year total.
Oh, no. Michael.
How?
Actually yes.
Okay.
Uhh, no, I... don't just sell real estate. Uh, my daughter has a skating lesson.
Hello, hi. Hey, Michael.
No. See, we never went on a ski trip.
Michael.
Okay, good night, Michael.
Michael talks about you... a lot.
Hi, I'm Carol.
Hi, hi.
Is this a financial thing? If it's a financial thing, what some people do is they rent out the third bedroom.
I think you're a really sweet guy.
Goodbye.
Wow, bad luck.
But, um, I don't know how to deal with, with this thing [waves Christmas card]. And, and the proposal. And I don't think things are going to work out with us.
Hi.
[louder] Can we talk about this in private?
You will lose $7,000 if you walk away right now.
I really need a moment alone with you. [Carol heads towards Michael's office.]
You're the temp!
It's a very gay-friendly neighborhood.
Who told you that?
No just the front two.
Ten year fixed, over thirty. Thirty year total.
Whenever you're ready.
They're not s'mores. They're samosas.
Can I get a red wine? So, two hours? That's a long drive.
Yes.
Well, I'm having a nice time.
No, I'm good.
I know. [Closes door.]
To answer your question...
Oh, great.
I went on a ski trip.
An Indian woman in a sari.
Hi.
Drink would be good.
I'd love to go.
