Hello, hi. Hey, Michael.
And then, I just need you to sign here at this arrow.
No, I'm good.
What?
Drink would be good.
Bye.
Oh, good, I'm glad. Can I drop it over later?
Michael...
Yes.
Michael?
Are we ready to sign some papers?
Whenever you're ready.
Can we talk about this in private?
Hi.
Michael.
[louder] Can we talk about this in private?
I went on a ski trip.
To answer your question...
Well, I'm having a nice time.
Hello.
What?
Well, ten over thirty, so thirty year total.
I have to get a sitter, but that shouldn't be a problem.
To the casino thing?
Actually yes.
What is this? [Holds up a Christmas photo]
Oh, no. Michael.
[whispering] I���m so sorry. They were an hour late.
What are you talking about?
This is the ninth date, Michael.
You will lose $7,000 if you walk away right now.
Oh, well, actually, I guess this would be our first date. I guess.
This is so weird.
You're the temp!
Oh, Michael.
[on phone] Hello, Michael?
Goodbye.
You, too.
[whispers] What?
Okay, good night, Michael.
It's a very gay-friendly neighborhood.
Get outta here.
I think you're a really sweet guy.
I'd love to go.
Oh, great.
They're not s'mores. They're samosas.
Wow, bad luck.
Are you okay?
I better go. Okay, you can find a way home, all right?
Hi, I'm Carol.
All right.
Top of your class at business school, and you live on Shady Hill Road, right?
[wearing cheerleader costume] I thought you said this was a costume party!
I'm sorry.
Okay.
Who told you that?
I really need a moment alone with you. [Carol heads towards Michael's office.]
An Indian woman in a sari.
But, um, I don't know how to deal with, with this thing [waves Christmas card]. And, and the proposal. And I don't think things are going to work out with us.
Can I get a red wine? So, two hours? That's a long drive.
Whenever you're ready, Michael.
[pause] Yes.
I'm great. I just needed one last signature for your mortgage insurance.
Is this a financial thing? If it's a financial thing, what some people do is they rent out the third bedroom.
He says... 'I love him.' He loves you.
How?
What does that mean?
Michael talks about you... a lot.
Hi, hi.
Hi.
What? Too spicy?
Ten year fixed, over thirty. Thirty year total.
Thanks. Thank you for inviting me. It looks so great in here.
I know. [Closes door.]
The wavy brown hair and blue eyes.
Michael, this is the unit you saw and...
Uhh, no, I... don't just sell real estate. Uh, my daughter has a skating lesson.
No just the front two.
No. See, we never went on a ski trip.
Two years ago with my kids and my ex-husband.
And I'll bring the papers, too.
