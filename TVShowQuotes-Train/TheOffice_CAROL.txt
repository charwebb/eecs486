To the casino thing?
I'm sorry.
Oh, Michael.
Are we ready to sign some papers?
[wearing cheerleader costume] I thought you said this was a costume party!
Hi, I'm Carol.
Michael.
Yes.
Hello, hi. Hey, Michael.
Thanks. Thank you for inviting me. It looks so great in here.
Okay, good night, Michael.
I'll see you tonight.
Okay.
Hi.
Uhh, no, I... don't just sell real estate. Uh, my daughter has a skating lesson.
No just the front two.
[whispering] I���m so sorry. They were an hour late.
Oh, good, I'm glad. Can I drop it over later?
What are you talking about?
Hi, is Michael around here?
Can I get a red wine? So, two hours? That's a long drive.
This is the ninth date, Michael.
Well, I'm having a nice time.
[on phone] Hello, Michael?
Goodbye.
I think you're a really sweet guy.
[whispers] What?
And I'll bring the papers, too.
They're not s'mores. They're samosas.
Two years ago with my kids and my ex-husband.
Whenever you're ready, Michael.
Michael...
[pause] Yes.
You will lose $7,000 if you walk away right now.
Hi, hi.
Sure.
Are you okay?
Oh, no. Michael.
Michael.
Oh, great.
Hello.
He says... 'I love him.' He loves you.
She seems really nice.
Top of your class at business school, and you live on Shady Hill Road, right?
What does that mean?
You're the temp!
An Indian woman in a sari.
Can we talk about this in private?
Drink would be good.
That's some extra income for you.
Wow, bad luck.
Hi.
How?
What is this? [Holds up a Christmas photo]
What? Too spicy?
Oh, great.
Whenever you're ready.
It's a very gay-friendly neighborhood.
Actually yes.
Oh, well, actually, I guess this would be our first date. I guess.
I really need a moment alone with you. [Carol heads towards Michael's office.]
[louder] Can we talk about this in private?
Is this a financial thing? If it's a financial thing, what some people do is they rent out the third bedroom.
I'd love to go.
To answer your question...
No, I'm good.
I'm great. I just needed one last signature for your mortgage insurance.
Michael talks about you... a lot.
What?
No problemo.
Get outta here.
The wavy brown hair and blue eyes.
I went on a ski trip.
But, um, I don't know how to deal with, with this thing [waves Christmas card]. And, and the proposal. And I don't think things are going to work out with us.
All right.
No. See, we never went on a ski trip.
What?
Michael, this is the unit you saw and...
You, too.
Michael?
And then, I just need you to sign here at this arrow.
