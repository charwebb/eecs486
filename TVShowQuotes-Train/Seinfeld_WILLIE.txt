Well, I, I need to see that ticket.
I thought you said it was a Twix.
Dad, I told you you could sit here only if you dont talk.
I wasn't wearing your jacket. Jerry you're imagining things. (he makes the circular motion next to his ears - the international symbol for insane)
Jerry that's a breach of the dry-cleaners code.
Mr. Costanza, I really dont have time for this.
Yeah, but this is different. Those fur storage warehouses are huge. You cant, get anything without a number.
Now? (Willie looks off with his eyes to his left -- he is thinking about his wife Donna)
Whoa, this is a beauty. Great cut. It's probably very flattering.
Wait, you, you mean to tell me you don't have a ticket for the coat?
