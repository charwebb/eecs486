No, Mr. Mouse.

Hey, Craig, over here!

Pass this up.

Oh, oh-and it's gonna be in 3-D. 

And be sure to give a ring to all the kids you care about, 'cause it's the hip new way to roll.

I gotta sit middle 'cause I get motion sickness. 

I d-I d'uh... Wow, that just fucked my head.

AAAH!

My waffle's d-hun, my waffle's d-hu-hun!

Ho! 

Yeah.

Let's be strong, guys.

We've all angered God.

You mean like that movie, Juwanna Mann?

Yes, 'cause you're a drunk piece of shit, Dad!

Just have a seat in there, kids. 

At my house? Why my house?

Yeah.

We have alarms going off across the country fourteen times a minute. That takes a lot of employees manning phones.

Bay-bay!

This is Kevin with Wolf Home Security. Is everything all right?

I have no idea, dude.

We aren', we aren't afraid of him.

Given the XBox's faster frame rate, we have no choice but to declare it the most technologically fit for Starfleet.

Let's trade sandwiches.

On screen.Â 

We... need to talk about something.

That one's mine, that one's mine!

Sir, it doesn't matter where we call you from, we still contact the police in your neighborhood.

And it means we stay away from bad stuff and avoid people who swear and watch naughty TV shows.

Nothin' much. We're just about to check out a Class M planet that might have new sources of trillurillium.

Perhaps we could use it to strengthen our star cruisers. 

Yeah, you tell 'em, Joe.

Engage, ensign. Warp factor 1.

I don't know.  Look, we called you back here because we want to share our love of Christ with you

Yeah, we've had it, Goshdarnit!

Shoot him!

Yeah. God put Bebe on earth to enrich everyone's lives.

Mom hit Dad again! 

Me too.
