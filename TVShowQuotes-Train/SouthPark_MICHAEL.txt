I think it's wrong what the police do to wealthy black men.

I don't know.  She texted from the bus they put her on, then she said she wasn't even allowed to have her cell phone where she was going. Then all of a sudden her texts went dark.

Here I am, Blanket!  Heeee!  Jeh chabee durtah!  Blanket! Oh my beautiful blanket!

We're gettin' close. Are you guys gettin' psyched?!

She said that her parents called her an emo and she had to go to this camp for two weeks.

No, Blanket, shhhh. Stop crying. It's okay, Blanket. Here, look.  Jeekabee durtah!  Ow!  There, Blanket, shhhh.  Hey, hey look, hey look.  I got your nose.  Look! Lookit, I got your nose. I got your nose, Blanket. See? 

This is Zipline Tours. We got sixteen more to go.

No, you just kind of did it on your own.

Up here, you get the best tactical view to protect the fortress. It is from here, Kenny, that you shall command the armies of heaven.

We can be spacemen, 
or pirates on the sea
Chuckajamonah!
Yes we can do everything,
and I mean, everything!
Chuckajamonah!
Up in my Wishing Tree!
Hee hee! Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh!

Okay okay, look, emos are more prone to suicide.

Okay, well, this is a Ponderosa pine. It covers a more extensive area than other Ameri-

Oh yeah, the stables. There's, there's a ranch right past that hill that rents out horses. I, I bet they can get you back.

Has she said one word to either one of you guys?

If you wanna be one of the non-conformists, all you have to do is dress just like us and listen to the same music we do.

Yeah, so listen: call up Firkle and meet me at Village Inn. I gotta run home, but I'll be there in ten minutes. 

Blanket likes to play, don't you Blanket?  Wee, look! He can fly!

Alright alright, think of it this way: a goth believes that deep down the world is totally fucked up. But an emo thinks that deep down, they are totally fucked up.

All right guys, this is where we're going to break for lunch.

As most of you know I once lost my job and my family because of my drinking. But with the help of AA I've been sober for ten years now.  Anyone have anything they wanna tell the groups, for starters?

Who needs that kind of Barbie love, anyway? Everyone's just walking around like a bunch of conformists. Go ahead and wear your business suits so you can make thirty-four thousand dollars a year to buy your condominium. They're all zombies racing to their graves. Love didn't work for my mom and dad. Why should it work for me?

What's the matter, Stan? Did you have a bad dream?

Because she's Goth, and some ignorant people don't know the difference!

Firkle! All this time I thought you were Goth! How long have you been Emo? 

What did they do you you? At that camp?

Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeee, look at us on the swing! We're swinging!

Oh Kyle, Blanket, yay, it's a slumber party!

Young man, do you know anything about the 12-Step Program?

No, dude! You can't say "I miss you so much, babe. I want to hold you in my arms."

Try and stay calm, the police are on their way.

You're right. I've been so obsessed with my childhood that I've forgotten about his. I thought having lots of rides and toys was enough, but... Blanket doesn't need a playmate. He needs a father, and a normal life. Chickuckoo gainuh.  Blanket, I wanna give away all my money. I- I wanna get a normal job and... take a shot at raising you in a normal setting. 

Biggest seller the past four months. What models are you lookin' at?

No, they're vamp. They wear plastic fangs and drink freaking Clamato juice.

It was all a prank by some douchey network reality show.

Oh, and don't forget... to take in the nar. Back to you, Michael.

We can't go home. There's a ghost in our house. Me and Blanket are scared.

We are running a little late, but if anyone really wants to know, we could take a few minutes.

Things can always work out, as long as we know we have the power to change.
We all have the power to change if we search inside our hearts'
And we start to heal the wounds of all our yesterdays
And you know it might be hard, but all you've got to do is start,
And you can change all of your evil molesting ways.
Jejabee durtah! Hee-hee! OOOOH! Jejabee durtah! Hee-hee! Jamonah! butcha-tamonah! Chich-cha!

Let's ride the train! The train! 
Would you like to ride the train with me,
and start a magical journey?

Chop wood? No, that's ignorant. That's poopie work. Blanket and me wanna play!

Jefferson! Michael ...Jefferson, yeh. Hey, you wanna play with me?  Come on, let's climb the tree!  Come on, climb the tree, climb the tree! 
Have you been up my... Wishing Tree? Tuh!
It's where I come to think and dream.
And now I'd like to show you my... Wishing Tree. 
Jam on!
Where we can laugh and giggle and scream. 
Hee hee!
Imagination is the key.

That's cool. I guess you can join up with us if you want.

What are you doing with my Blanket?  Come on, Blanket, play with me. Jeechabee durtah! Hee! 

Prepare the troops!  We must be ready for them!  The time is at hand, Kenny. The stage is set and the final battle between Heaven and Hell is about to begin! The fate of the outcome is in your hands.  Where'd he go?

On a journey through both of our minds.

Alright guys, should be about forty five minutes to the freshest nar nar. Why don't we go around the van and get to know each other a little bit?

I just can't believe it. I can't believe parents would do that to their child.

No.  What are you doing?! I don't wanna be emo!

Yeah! Because their hearts are full of greed and they have... doo-doo in their souls.

None of us are in charge. We're all powerless.

You just can't cut down on your drinking, Randy. You need to know something. You have a disease.

The child did something none of us could: Reach level sixty on the PSP. Now I don't know if that's luck or perseverance, but it's Goddamned impressive. All right, Kenny, let me show you what we're up against.  This is the Kingdom of Heaven. Satan's armies will attack the gate ...here. They are... ten billion in number. Maybe more.  Our armies are here, here, and here. Just under... ten thousand strong.  We are outnumbered and in need of someone who can single handedly bring the whole Dark Empire down. Basically, Kenny, you... are Keanu Reeves. 

Then why are you listening to Sunny Day Real Estate?  I was thinking, maybe they just made you confused at that place. Maybe they didn't know what they were doing. But then I started thinking, maybe that place... turned you emo on purpose. Like maybe they knew what they were doing.

Oh my God, they killed Kenny! Get him into the command station! Hurry!  Satan's army charges! Tell our troops what to do, Kenny!  So it begins.  Now we shall see the final battle between Heaven and Hell play out!  Yesss, good, Kenny! The angel spearmen are taking out their demon soul rippers! Oh, the cavalry angels are clashing with their Black Knights! Oh my God! My God, this battle is epic! Ohh, they're bringing in their demon dragons! Look at the size of them! My God, this is even bigger than the final battle in the Lord of the Rings movie! It's like, it's like TEN times bigger than that battle!

That's great. And I understand this is somebody's first AA meeting, is that right? &lt;/&gt; Y-yes, you sir. Stand on up and introduce yourself.

I would definitely recommend the voice assist. It has recorded voice commands to help motivate you in your workout.

Come on, Blanket. We have to go home and feed the animals. Bye, friends. 

Are you stupid, Uriel? Japanese people don't have souls!

Yeah, I don't ever remember AC/DC singing about letting dudes beat up on their girlfriends.

That's right. Alcoholism is a disease. You're sick, Randy. You're very very sick. And just like with most diseases, you can't cure it yourself. And it's deadly.

Well it's not religious. You just have to admit that there is some kind of god which has power over you and turn your life over to that god and ask him for forgiveness. That's the 12-step program, not religion.

What the hell are you doing to people?!

Oh, you mean the little kid with the herpes?

Don't take this the wrong way, but I think that place turned you into an emo.

Oh oh, we were just having a slumber party. 

Let's ride and ride on the train together

All right, your turn, Stan. Read one of your poems about pain.

But... that's not natural. God intended Kenny to die! What are these people doing?!

He can't quit by himself. None of us could. He needs divine intervention. Spirituality.

It works just like the ones we sent to Earth. All the commands you make will be sent to the troops down on the battlefield. All you have to do is play the game, Kenny. Only this time, It's for reals.

He should be. He's here playing that game every single day after school. I think he's spent about six thousand dollars on it so far. 

Inappropriate? No, you're being ignorant. They're my friends. You see, I- I didn't have a childhood, so I'm really just a child myself.  Here, everything's okay. I want you each to have a hundred dollars. 

All the adults are trying to get us. Get up to your room, Blanket, and put your mask on! We can't go outside anymore! 

No, Dr. Nelson, I'm telling you, you have to fly out here right now! My nose came off again!  I know you live in California; I'll pay for your plane ticket!  But I'm falling apart! I need some more of that cream and the injections! I have to look young again!  Oh, I'm melting!

She won't even look at us. All she does now is hang out with the douchebag emo kids. 

But goths are more prone to be depressed that so many people commit suicide

This golden PSP is king of all PSPs.

You're not really a vampire? Really? I'm so freaking shocked. 

Kick it over! Stop the plant!  Oh! Oh, thank God you're here. Emos are plants and they're invading human bodies.

Send our troops to the battlefield! I'll command as best I can!

Go ahead and go back to your sunshine fairytale!

Wait, I thought we were cynical. ...What what whatever, it doesn't matter.

Please don't make us go back home. Please! We're scared, we're scared!

Sorry, I guess we just don't care enough.

I just. Don't. Get it. We sent the head vampire kid to Scottsdale, but still more and more kids are dressing up like vampires.

Yeah. There's this Asian kid name Yao. He's an expert at that Dance Dance Revolution game. 

Of course we're going to go with the PS4. They're blacker!

Randy, you are powerless to make that decision. The only thing that works is the 12-step program.  Step 1 is admitting that you are powerless to control your drinking. Only then can you move on to the other 12 steps, like, believing that only a higher power, God, makes you stop drinking. And then, turning your life over to that God and, humbly asking God to remove your weaknesses.

Alright guys, let's get movin'! Only ten minutes till our next zipliiine! 

Doesn't matter why. Pretty soon, the whole school is going to be an endless hive of conformist happy-go-lucky vampire wannabes.

Yesss. Yes, Kenny! Satan's forces are retreating! This is TRULY a sight to behold! OH I wish I had a camcorder!  We have done it! We have defeated the armies of Satan! 

Oh yay, my friends are here! Come inside and play, guys!

Look at me, I'm Peter Pan.  T-shamon! 
I'm a little boy forever.  Hey!

Mememe! I'm first! I'm first!  Oooo, let's go ride the choo-choo train!

Oh I'm retired now, but, I was in... pharmaceuticals

No, Blanket, stop!  It's ignorant. You're being ignorant!

Now let's all sleep and dream
Heehee!
of fun and adventurous things
shamonah!
It's time for us all to say goodnight

We can't be a dance troupe with just guys. People will think we're fags.

Hey, can we get more coffee over here?

So, everyone's saying there's gonna be a fight between Eric Cartman and your girlfriend.

Well you got your standard, your deluxe model, large sizes, but, if you're really lookin' for a workout you might wanna try the Big Gym. That woman over there is trying it out. 

I'm such a nonconformist that I'm not going to conform with the rest of you. Okay, I'll do it. 

Alright, remember to keep your clear of the cable and just let your equipment do the work.  Now, when you're about halfway down the zipline, the camera's gonna take your picture, so when I call out "Shockabra!", look up and give the camera a nice "shockabra" . Alright, you ready?

Next zipline's up here, we call it the Terminator.

I just id- identify so much with children. Their innocence, their beauty. I think that God is in the face of every child.

Allison Merch is a vampire kid now? This thing isn't going to stop.

She's only been there two weeks. They can't have changed her that much. Can they have? 

Kenny remains our only hope! Here is what we must do.  Gabriel and Uriel, you go down to Earth and try to get that feeding tube removed. In the meantime  we will put all our troops at Heaven's Gate. We will try to keep Hell's Army from breaking through as long as possible.  Hopefully, it will be long enough to get our Keanu Reeves back.

Jesus, sorry dude, but we're at the summit. The only way down is to zip down.
