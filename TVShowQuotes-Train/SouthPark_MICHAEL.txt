Has she said one word to either one of you guys?
Well it's not religious. You just have to admit that there is some kind of god which has power over you and turn your life over to that god and ask him for forgiveness. That's the 12-step program, not religion.
No, Dr. Nelson, I'm telling you, you have to fly out here right now! My nose came off again!  I know you live in California; I'll pay for your plane ticket!  But I'm falling apart! I need some more of that cream and the injections! I have to look young again!  Oh, I'm melting!
Okay okay, look, emos are more prone to suicide.
Allison Merch is a vampire kid now? This thing isn't going to stop.
She's only been there two weeks. They can't have changed her that much. Can they have? 
We can't go home. There's a ghost in our house. Me and Blanket are scared.
No, they're vamp. They wear plastic fangs and drink freaking Clamato juice.
Oh my God, they killed Kenny! Get him into the command station! Hurry!  Satan's army charges! Tell our troops what to do, Kenny!  So it begins.  Now we shall see the final battle between Heaven and Hell play out!  Yesss, good, Kenny! The angel spearmen are taking out their demon soul rippers! Oh, the cavalry angels are clashing with their Black Knights! Oh my God! My God, this battle is epic! Ohh, they're bringing in their demon dragons! Look at the size of them! My God, this is even bigger than the final battle in the Lord of the Rings movie! It's like, it's like TEN times bigger than that battle!
Yeah. There's this Asian kid name Yao. He's an expert at that Dance Dance Revolution game. 
Things can always work out, as long as we know we have the power to change.
We all have the power to change if we search inside our hearts'
And we start to heal the wounds of all our yesterdays
And you know it might be hard, but all you've got to do is start,
And you can change all of your evil molesting ways.
Jejabee durtah! Hee-hee! OOOOH! Jejabee durtah! Hee-hee! Jamonah! butcha-tamonah! Chich-cha!
No, you just kind of did it on your own.
Oh yay, my friends are here! Come inside and play, guys!
Kick it over! Stop the plant!  Oh! Oh, thank God you're here. Emos are plants and they're invading human bodies.
Yesss. Yes, Kenny! Satan's forces are retreating! This is TRULY a sight to behold! OH I wish I had a camcorder!  We have done it! We have defeated the armies of Satan! 
Are you stupid, Uriel? Japanese people don't have souls!
Let's ride the train! The train! 
Would you like to ride the train with me,
and start a magical journey?
What the hell are you doing to people?!
Oh my God it's worse than we thought! They made her emo!
No, Blanket, shhhh. Stop crying. It's okay, Blanket. Here, look.  Jeekabee durtah!  Ow!  There, Blanket, shhhh.  Hey, hey look, hey look.  I got your nose.  Look! Lookit, I got your nose. I got your nose, Blanket. See? 
No.  What are you doing?! I don't wanna be emo!
What? Where are you tay- No! NO!!  What the hell?? ...Oh my God.  Get me out of here! Let me go!
It was all a prank by some douchey network reality show.
Young man, do you know anything about the 12-Step Program?
No, Blanket, stop!  It's ignorant. You're being ignorant!
Oh, you mean the little kid with the herpes?
Jesus, sorry dude, but we're at the summit. The only way down is to zip down.
Oh oh, we were just having a slumber party. 
You're not really a vampire? Really? I'm so freaking shocked. 
I don't know.  She texted from the bus they put her on, then she said she wasn't even allowed to have her cell phone where she was going. Then all of a sudden her texts went dark.
Oh, and don't forget... to take in the nar. Back to you, Michael.
Biggest seller the past four months. What models are you lookin' at?
Sorry, I guess we just don't care enough.
Alright guys, should be about forty five minutes to the freshest nar nar. Why don't we go around the van and get to know each other a little bit?
No! You've gotta listen to me! You don't know what you're doing!!  You fucking conformists!  They're evillll!
Don't take this the wrong way, but I think that place turned you into an emo.
This golden PSP is king of all PSPs.
If you wanna be one of the non-conformists, all you have to do is dress just like us and listen to the same music we do.
Yeah! Because their hearts are full of greed and they have... doo-doo in their souls.
Up here, you get the best tactical view to protect the fortress. It is from here, Kenny, that you shall command the armies of heaven.
What did they do you you? At that camp?
Alright guys, let's get movin'! Only ten minutes till our next zipliiine! 
Jefferson! Michael ...Jefferson, yeh. Hey, you wanna play with me?  Come on, let's climb the tree!  Come on, climb the tree, climb the tree! 
Have you been up my... Wishing Tree? Tuh!
It's where I come to think and dream.
And now I'd like to show you my... Wishing Tree. 
Jam on!
Where we can laugh and giggle and scream. 
Hee hee!
Imagination is the key.
On a journey through both of our minds.
All the adults are trying to get us. Get up to your room, Blanket, and put your mask on! We can't go outside anymore! 
He can't quit by himself. None of us could. He needs divine intervention. Spirituality.
I'm such a nonconformist that I'm not going to conform with the rest of you. Okay, I'll do it. 
Try and stay calm, the police are on their way.
We can't be a dance troupe with just guys. People will think we're fags.
Look at me, I'm Peter Pan.  T-shamon! 
I'm a little boy forever.  Hey!
What's the matter, Stan? Did you have a bad dream?
Firkle! All this time I thought you were Goth! How long have you been Emo? 
We're gettin' close. Are you guys gettin' psyched?!
Inappropriate? No, you're being ignorant. They're my friends. You see, I- I didn't have a childhood, so I'm really just a child myself.  Here, everything's okay. I want you each to have a hundred dollars. 
No! I mean Henrietta. I confronted her and she was all like "I am emo! And emos are going to rule the world" and I was like "No waaay!" and she was like "Yeah, soon it will be too late." and I was all "No waaay!"
Kenny remains our only hope! Here is what we must do.  Gabriel and Uriel, you go down to Earth and try to get that feeding tube removed. In the meantime  we will put all our troops at Heaven's Gate. We will try to keep Hell's Army from breaking through as long as possible.  Hopefully, it will be long enough to get our Keanu Reeves back.
She won't even look at us. All she does now is hang out with the douchebag emo kids. 
Alright, here we are. Looks like we got some good nar to zipline through today. Uh, but before we climb up and start ziplining, does anyone care to know about these trees' biology?
Doesn't matter why. Pretty soon, the whole school is going to be an endless hive of conformist happy-go-lucky vampire wannabes.
I think it's wrong what the police do to wealthy black men.
Who needs that kind of Barbie love, anyway? Everyone's just walking around like a bunch of conformists. Go ahead and wear your business suits so you can make thirty-four thousand dollars a year to buy your condominium. They're all zombies racing to their graves. Love didn't work for my mom and dad. Why should it work for me?
Of course we're going to go with the PS4. They're blacker!
Come on, Blanket. We have to go home and feed the animals. Bye, friends. 
Yeah.  The only cool way to dance is to keep your hands at your sides and your eyes looking at the ground. Then every three seconds you take a drag from your cigarette. 
Go ahead and go back to your sunshine fairytale!
Okay, well, this is a Ponderosa pine. It covers a more extensive area than other Ameri-
Wait, I thought we were cynical. ...What what whatever, it doesn't matter.
But... that's not natural. God intended Kenny to die! What are these people doing?!
Next zipline's up here, we call it the Terminator.
Conformist. Have fun in your rat-race life, living paycheck to paycheck for corporate gains.
I just id- identify so much with children. Their innocence, their beauty. I think that God is in the face of every child.
It works just like the ones we sent to Earth. All the commands you make will be sent to the troops down on the battlefield. All you have to do is play the game, Kenny. Only this time, It's for reals.
He should be. He's here playing that game every single day after school. I think he's spent about six thousand dollars on it so far. 
Small white ones, yes ma'am.  Standard or voice assist model?
No, dude! You can't say "I miss you so much, babe. I want to hold you in my arms."
Send our troops to the battlefield! I'll command as best I can!
Because she's Goth, and some ignorant people don't know the difference!
Now let's all sleep and dream
Heehee!
of fun and adventurous things
shamonah!
It's time for us all to say goodnight
That's great. And I understand this is somebody's first AA meeting, is that right? &lt;/&gt; Y-yes, you sir. Stand on up and introduce yourself.
I just. Don't. Get it. We sent the head vampire kid to Scottsdale, but still more and more kids are dressing up like vampires.
She said that her parents called her an emo and she had to go to this camp for two weeks.
Mememe! I'm first! I'm first!  Oooo, let's go ride the choo-choo train!
I walked into the cafeteria today. Rebecca Miller and Philip Russ were dressed like vampires drinking Clamato juice with four kids from the football team.
Alright, remember to keep your clear of the cable and just let your equipment do the work.  Now, when you're about halfway down the zipline, the camera's gonna take your picture, so when I call out "Shockabra!", look up and give the camera a nice "shockabra" . Alright, you ready?
Then why are you listening to Sunny Day Real Estate?  I was thinking, maybe they just made you confused at that place. Maybe they didn't know what they were doing. But then I started thinking, maybe that place... turned you emo on purpose. Like maybe they knew what they were doing.
Here I am, Blanket!  Heeee!  Jeh chabee durtah!  Blanket! Oh my beautiful blanket!
Yes, Kenny! And to thank you for all you've done, we are going to give you a very special gift. For saving the entire universe from the forces of evil, we give you this.  Keanu Reeves' statue.  Congratulations. 
The child did something none of us could: Reach level sixty on the PSP. Now I don't know if that's luck or perseverance, but it's Goddamned impressive. All right, Kenny, let me show you what we're up against.  This is the Kingdom of Heaven. Satan's armies will attack the gate ...here. They are... ten billion in number. Maybe more.  Our armies are here, here, and here. Just under... ten thousand strong.  We are outnumbered and in need of someone who can single handedly bring the whole Dark Empire down. Basically, Kenny, you... are Keanu Reeves. 
Randy, you are powerless to make that decision. The only thing that works is the 12-step program.  Step 1 is admitting that you are powerless to control your drinking. Only then can you move on to the other 12 steps, like, believing that only a higher power, God, makes you stop drinking. And then, turning your life over to that God and, humbly asking God to remove your weaknesses.
Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeee, look at us on the swing! We're swinging!
Chop wood? No, that's ignorant. That's poopie work. Blanket and me wanna play!
As most of you know I once lost my job and my family because of my drinking. But with the help of AA I've been sober for ten years now.  Anyone have anything they wanna tell the groups, for starters?
But goths are more prone to be depressed that so many people commit suicide
That's cool. I guess you can join up with us if you want.
Blanket likes to play, don't you Blanket?  Wee, look! He can fly!
Let's ride and ride on the train together
Alright alright, think of it this way: a goth believes that deep down the world is totally fucked up. But an emo thinks that deep down, they are totally fucked up.
Oh Kyle, Blanket, yay, it's a slumber party!
I just can't believe it. I can't believe parents would do that to their child.
What are you doing with my Blanket?  Come on, Blanket, play with me. Jeechabee durtah! Hee! 
This is Zipline Tours. We got sixteen more to go.
Yeah, I don't ever remember AC/DC singing about letting dudes beat up on their girlfriends.
All right, your turn, Stan. Read one of your poems about pain.
That's right. Alcoholism is a disease. You're sick, Randy. You're very very sick. And just like with most diseases, you can't cure it yourself. And it's deadly.
Oh yeah, the stables. There's, there's a ranch right past that hill that rents out horses. I, I bet they can get you back.
Oh I'm retired now, but, I was in... pharmaceuticals
We are running a little late, but if anyone really wants to know, we could take a few minutes.
So, everyone's saying there's gonna be a fight between Eric Cartman and your girlfriend.
Please don't make us go back home. Please! We're scared, we're scared!
