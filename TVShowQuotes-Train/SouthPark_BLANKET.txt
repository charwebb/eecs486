I really like your town. My dad wanted to move somewhere to get away from it all. He said he wanted peace and quiet, and to live with a bunch of hicks who don't know anything. 
You are? Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you! 
Wow, these are great. What are they called again?
It's my mask. My daddy says it's best for me to hide my face. My name's Blanket.
Nah, I'm not supposed to. Dad says I have to keep my face hidden. 
Wait! Don't you guys wanna come inside and play?
No, this is all my dad's stuff. He loves toys and video games.
Come on, my dad's probably out in the backyard. 
No... But I used to have a lot of bodyguards and nannies, if that counts.
I have a half-brother and a half-sister. But they live with their mom now.
My daddy wanted to have a baby, so he put me in a test tube. Then, they put me in a woman's tummy, and, when I was born, Daddy took me home.
