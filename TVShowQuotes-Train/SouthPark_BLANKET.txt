Yeah, I just moved here with my dad. Are you gonna be my new friends?
No, this is all my dad's stuff. He loves toys and video games.
My daddy wanted to have a baby, so he put me in a test tube. Then, they put me in a woman's tummy, and, when I was born, Daddy took me home.
No... But I used to have a lot of bodyguards and nannies, if that counts.
It's my mask. My daddy says it's best for me to hide my face. My name's Blanket.
Come on, my dad's probably out in the backyard. 
You are? Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you! 
I have a half-brother and a half-sister. But they live with their mom now.
Nah, I'm not supposed to. Dad says I have to keep my face hidden. 
Wait! Don't you guys wanna come inside and play?
Wow, these are great. What are they called again?
