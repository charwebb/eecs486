(reading) Why do they call it Ovaltine? The mug is round. The jar is round. They should call it round tine. That's gold, Jerry! Gold!
Did you get that here?
Ouch.
You're supposed to buy me dinner in a nice restaurant, like Mendys.
But I had the hot dog.
Two Mendys.
300 dollars.
Hey Jerry.
You throw the shirt in?
You worn the suit yet?
Killed. (pause) I'm gonna go pick up some chicks. Good-looking ones, too! (walking away) Hey, what's your name?
Ahh, you know what I think. Im just going to have soup. Yeah, Ill save the meal for another time.
You gonna be home later?
Listen Jerry, I've been doing some thinking. I want my suit back.
Hey Jerry, where's my suit?
What kind of soup do you have?
I had a hot dog earlier. Im not that hungry.
Kramer.
Im really not comfortable ...
OH! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Can I squeeze in? (to George)
Ill drop it off. (raps his knuckle twice on the table again, turns and walks away)
Here you go.
Yeah. Well, lets hurry up and eat I gotta get out of here. Im meeting a woman for a drink.
I start off with curls. That's good for the bicep. (motions with 2 fingers along his right bicep) I do 10 reps, 2 sets.
Well all you gotta do is tell Kramer to give me my money back, and you'll get your ticket.
42, That's what I am now. I've been working out, Im huge. How'd you like to sell it?
Mmm. This soup is great.
Why not?
Wait till you try the swordfish. You know Jerry, I was thinking. For our next meal, do you think we should come here ... or should we go someplace else? You know it has it's pros and cons. On the one hand, here, you're guaranteed a great meal. On the other hand --
You think you can give me a hand with my material?
Hey that's the women's dressing room.
Hi. (to Elaine)
Kramer, I want my money back for this suit. You're nancy-boy cream leaked all over the pockets -- Suits ruined.
Thank you, thank you, (To Jerry) Hey, Jerry, did ya see me up there? I was killing, Jerry. Killing. I killed.
[It's K.B., I have the suit]
What size are you?
I think he's in a good mood.
Hey.
Hey Jerry!
Didja hear what happened? The mentor saw my act. She dumped me.
How about that Jerry? First you had a pilot on NBC and now I'll have one. Looks like I'm following you again.
But I don't want anything but soup.
Can we go back to Mendys?
I just stopped by to thank you. That risk management stuff you wrote for me? It's killer!
Hey Jerry, didja see it?
Yeah. You buy me a meal -- you can't get a better deal than that (pats Jerry on the shoulder)
You work out with weights?
You worn the suit yet?
Ok, Ill have tomato soup and ah, tuna on toast.
You promised me.
Oh, get the swordfish. Best swordfish in the city. The best, Jerry.
Twice? I wanna go twice.
(leans backwards from the counter) Yeah!
Great. I've been working out. Went from a size 40, to a 42.
You should.
This guy makes the best soup in the city, Jerry. The best. You know what they call him? Soup Nazi.
Yes
Hi, Jerry. It's Kenny.
That's right, and it's an Armani.
Yeah, Im huge (ducks his head into his right shoulder with false modesty) Well, Ill leave you guys alone. (raps his knuckle twice on the table, turns and walks away)
You're telling me.
How about Mendys, ooh, ever been there?
Ah, soup and a sandwich for a brand-new Armani suit. Is that any kind of gesture? (turns to George)
This is lunch in a coffee shop
Hey, Jerry!! How's it going?! You gonna join us for dinner? The duck here's the best. The best, Jerry.
Hey Jerry, this is Jenna. Pretty good-lookin' huh?
I don't even want anything for it.
You know, I was thinking if you're not busy, maybe I can get my meal today?
Hey (holds the Armani suit up) Here you go. (walks into the apt.)
Jerry.
Hey Jerry.
Ah youre gonna love it. Ill meet you there around 700.
Ill tell you what -- you can take me out to dinner sometime.
I told you Mendys had the best pea soup. The best Jerry, the best. Are you enjoying it?
(looking at the ticket then quickly looks up at Jerry) You trying to get out of Mendys? you cant do that.
Hey Kramer.
It's hard for me to find pants that --
You did?
Hey! Hey! (he runs out the door after Simon; from outside) Come Here You!
Puke? That's a funny word. Can I use that?
Hey, Jerry! I didn't know you liked soup.
Pretty good.
I just got a brand new Armani suit -- doesn't fit me anymore. You want it?
Oh come on. Why should it just sit in the closet?
You didnt think I was really going to give you a suit, did you?
Oh. This is awkward.
Well it's my suit.
Some woman named Uma. I got her number off of that ticket before it was smudged. Hope she's good-looking. (crosses his fingers in the air)
Aw, it's gold, Jerry! Gold! I got all these corporate gigs and even Cynthia took me back.
175
What are you talking about? this isn't a meal.
Maybe she's right. Maybe I am a complete hack. I'm the absolute worst. The worst, Jerry.
