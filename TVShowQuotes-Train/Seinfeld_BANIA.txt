Im looking for a new suit. I cant find anything I like. That's a nice suit. (admiring Kramers suit)
Ok, Ill have tomato soup and ah, tuna on toast.
Hey! Hey! (he runs out the door after Simon; from outside) Come Here You!
Oh, get the swordfish. Best swordfish in the city. The best, Jerry.
Great. I've been working out. Went from a size 40, to a 42.
You think you can give me a hand with my material?
Ill tell you what -- you can take me out to dinner sometime.
I just got a brand new Armani suit -- doesn't fit me anymore. You want it?
(reading) Why do they call it Ovaltine? The mug is round. The jar is round. They should call it round tine. That's gold, Jerry! Gold!
Hey (holds the Armani suit up) Here you go. (walks into the apt.)
(looking at the ticket then quickly looks up at Jerry) You trying to get out of Mendys? you cant do that.
Puke? That's a funny word. Can I use that?
42, That's what I am now. I've been working out, Im huge. How'd you like to sell it?
Oh come on. Why should it just sit in the closet?
Kramer, I want my money back for this suit. You're nancy-boy cream leaked all over the pockets -- Suits ruined.
You're supposed to buy me dinner in a nice restaurant, like Mendys.
You didnt think I was really going to give you a suit, did you?
Well all you gotta do is tell Kramer to give me my money back, and you'll get your ticket.
I told you Mendys had the best pea soup. The best Jerry, the best. Are you enjoying it?
Oh. Jerry, You know what just hit me? I was thinking -- What size suit are you?
Some woman named Uma. I got her number off of that ticket before it was smudged. Hope she's good-looking. (crosses his fingers in the air)
Killed. (pause) I'm gonna go pick up some chicks. Good-looking ones, too! (walking away) Hey, what's your name?
How about that Jerry? First you had a pilot on NBC and now I'll have one. Looks like I'm following you again.
Listen Jerry, I've been doing some thinking. I want my suit back.
It's hard for me to find pants that --
Yeah. You buy me a meal -- you can't get a better deal than that (pats Jerry on the shoulder)
What are you talking about? this isn't a meal.
Yeah. Well, lets hurry up and eat I gotta get out of here. Im meeting a woman for a drink.
This guy makes the best soup in the city, Jerry. The best. You know what they call him? Soup Nazi.
Hey, Jerry!! How's it going?! You gonna join us for dinner? The duck here's the best. The best, Jerry.
I just stopped by to thank you. That risk management stuff you wrote for me? It's killer!
Ah youre gonna love it. Ill meet you there around 700.
Yeah, Im huge (ducks his head into his right shoulder with false modesty) Well, Ill leave you guys alone. (raps his knuckle twice on the table, turns and walks away)
Ahh, you know what I think. Im just going to have soup. Yeah, Ill save the meal for another time.
Soup's not a meal. You're supposed to buy me a meal.
Hey, Jerry! I didn't know you liked soup.
OH! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Can I squeeze in? (to George)
Didja hear what happened? The mentor saw my act. She dumped me.
I had a hot dog earlier. Im not that hungry.
Maybe she's right. Maybe I am a complete hack. I'm the absolute worst. The worst, Jerry.
Hey, I give you a brand-new Armani suit, and you won't even buy me a meal?
You know, I was thinking if you're not busy, maybe I can get my meal today?
Ah, soup and a sandwich for a brand-new Armani suit. Is that any kind of gesture? (turns to George)
Hey Jerry, this is Jenna. Pretty good-lookin' huh?
Ill drop it off. (raps his knuckle twice on the table again, turns and walks away)
