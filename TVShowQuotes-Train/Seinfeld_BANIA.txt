Ahh, you know what I think. Im just going to have soup. Yeah, Ill save the meal for another time.
Hey, Jerry! I didn't know you liked soup.
42, That's what I am now. I've been working out, Im huge. How'd you like to sell it?
Soup's not a meal. You're supposed to buy me a meal.
I just stopped by to thank you. That risk management stuff you wrote for me? It's killer!
I just got a brand new Armani suit -- doesn't fit me anymore. You want it?
Yeah. You buy me a meal -- you can't get a better deal than that (pats Jerry on the shoulder)
(looking at the ticket then quickly looks up at Jerry) You trying to get out of Mendys? you cant do that.
Oh come on. Why should it just sit in the closet?
Oh, get the swordfish. Best swordfish in the city. The best, Jerry.
Well all you gotta do is tell Kramer to give me my money back, and you'll get your ticket.
Hey Jerry, this is Jenna. Pretty good-lookin' huh?
Ah, soup and a sandwich for a brand-new Armani suit. Is that any kind of gesture? (turns to George)
Ill drop it off. (raps his knuckle twice on the table again, turns and walks away)
Kramer, I want my money back for this suit. You're nancy-boy cream leaked all over the pockets -- Suits ruined.
Puke? That's a funny word. Can I use that?
You know, I was thinking if you're not busy, maybe I can get my meal today?
Ah youre gonna love it. Ill meet you there around 700.
Listen Jerry, I've been doing some thinking. I want my suit back.
Thank you, thank you, (To Jerry) Hey, Jerry, did ya see me up there? I was killing, Jerry. Killing. I killed.
Great. I've been working out. Went from a size 40, to a 42.
Ill tell you what -- you can take me out to dinner sometime.
You think you can give me a hand with my material?
Yeah. Well, lets hurry up and eat I gotta get out of here. Im meeting a woman for a drink.
Hey (holds the Armani suit up) Here you go. (walks into the apt.)
Aw, it's gold, Jerry! Gold! I got all these corporate gigs and even Cynthia took me back.
Killed. (pause) I'm gonna go pick up some chicks. Good-looking ones, too! (walking away) Hey, what's your name?
(reading) Why do they call it Ovaltine? The mug is round. The jar is round. They should call it round tine. That's gold, Jerry! Gold!
This guy makes the best soup in the city, Jerry. The best. You know what they call him? Soup Nazi.
You didnt think I was really going to give you a suit, did you?
How about that Jerry? First you had a pilot on NBC and now I'll have one. Looks like I'm following you again.
All right. Ill leave you alone. (turns and walks out the door)
Hey! Hey! (he runs out the door after Simon; from outside) Come Here You!
Yeah, Im huge (ducks his head into his right shoulder with false modesty) Well, Ill leave you guys alone. (raps his knuckle twice on the table, turns and walks away)
OH! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Can I squeeze in? (to George)
Didja hear what happened? The mentor saw my act. She dumped me.
Wait till you try the swordfish. You know Jerry, I was thinking. For our next meal, do you think we should come here ... or should we go someplace else? You know it has it's pros and cons. On the one hand, here, you're guaranteed a great meal. On the other hand --
Hey, Jerry!! How's it going?! You gonna join us for dinner? The duck here's the best. The best, Jerry.
I start off with curls. That's good for the bicep. (motions with 2 fingers along his right bicep) I do 10 reps, 2 sets.
Im looking for a new suit. I cant find anything I like. That's a nice suit. (admiring Kramers suit)
Hey, I give you a brand-new Armani suit, and you won't even buy me a meal?
Some woman named Uma. I got her number off of that ticket before it was smudged. Hope she's good-looking. (crosses his fingers in the air)
What are you talking about? this isn't a meal.
I had a hot dog earlier. Im not that hungry.
It's hard for me to find pants that --
