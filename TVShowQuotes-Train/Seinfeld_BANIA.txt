Hey, Jerry! I didn't know you liked soup.
You worn the suit yet?
Yeah. You buy me a meal -- you can't get a better deal than that (pats Jerry on the shoulder)
Oh. Jerry, You know what just hit me? I was thinking -- What size suit are you?
(reading) Why do they call it Ovaltine? The mug is round. The jar is round. They should call it round tine. That's gold, Jerry! Gold!
I start off with curls. That's good for the bicep. (motions with 2 fingers along his right bicep) I do 10 reps, 2 sets.
Did you get that here?
Ah youre gonna love it. Ill meet you there around 700.
Hey Jerry.
Hey Jerry.
Hey.
Mmm. This soup is great.
OH! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Can I squeeze in? (to George)
Hey, Jerry!! How's it going?! You gonna join us for dinner? The duck here's the best. The best, Jerry.
Oh come on. Why should it just sit in the closet?
Listen Jerry, I've been doing some thinking. I want my suit back.
You work out with weights?
Im looking for a new suit. I cant find anything I like. That's a nice suit. (admiring Kramers suit)
Ill tell you what -- you can take me out to dinner sometime.
Hey Jerry, this is Jenna. Pretty good-lookin' huh?
You promised me.
You throw the shirt in?
Soup's not a meal. You're supposed to buy me a meal.
100 Bucks
42, That's what I am now. I've been working out, Im huge. How'd you like to sell it?
Didja hear what happened? The mentor saw my act. She dumped me.
But I don't want anything but soup.
Can we go back to Mendys?
This guy makes the best soup in the city, Jerry. The best. You know what they call him? Soup Nazi.
Hey Jerry!
Hey (holds the Armani suit up) Here you go. (walks into the apt.)
Oh. This is awkward.
Ahh, you know what I think. Im just going to have soup. Yeah, Ill save the meal for another time.
Killed. (pause) I'm gonna go pick up some chicks. Good-looking ones, too! (walking away) Hey, what's your name?
I think he's in a good mood.
Yes
Ok, Ill have tomato soup and ah, tuna on toast.
175
Hey that's the women's dressing room.
You did?
Thank you, thank you, (To Jerry) Hey, Jerry, did ya see me up there? I was killing, Jerry. Killing. I killed.
Twice? I wanna go twice.
How about Mendys, ooh, ever been there?
You should.
Hey Kramer.
You know, I was thinking if you're not busy, maybe I can get my meal today?
I just stopped by to thank you. That risk management stuff you wrote for me? It's killer!
All right. Ill leave you alone. (turns and walks out the door)
Why not?
Wait till you try the swordfish. You know Jerry, I was thinking. For our next meal, do you think we should come here ... or should we go someplace else? You know it has it's pros and cons. On the one hand, here, you're guaranteed a great meal. On the other hand --
Kramer, I want my money back for this suit. You're nancy-boy cream leaked all over the pockets -- Suits ruined.
I don't even want anything for it.
That's right, and it's an Armani.
Here you go.
Yeah. Well, lets hurry up and eat I gotta get out of here. Im meeting a woman for a drink.
You worn the suit yet?
Ah, soup and a sandwich for a brand-new Armani suit. Is that any kind of gesture? (turns to George)
You're telling me.
300 dollars.
Hi. (to Elaine)
How about that Jerry? First you had a pilot on NBC and now I'll have one. Looks like I'm following you again.
You're supposed to buy me dinner in a nice restaurant, like Mendys.
I told you Mendys had the best pea soup. The best Jerry, the best. Are you enjoying it?
Elaine, where's Kramer?
This is lunch in a coffee shop
Jerry.
Puke? That's a funny word. Can I use that?
You didnt think I was really going to give you a suit, did you?
Im really not comfortable ...
Well all you gotta do is tell Kramer to give me my money back, and you'll get your ticket.
What are you talking about? this isn't a meal.
Well it's my suit.
Hey Jerry, didja see it?
What size are you?
(looking at the ticket then quickly looks up at Jerry) You trying to get out of Mendys? you cant do that.
What kind of soup do you have?
It's hard for me to find pants that --
[It's K.B., I have the suit]
I had a hot dog earlier. Im not that hungry.
Ahh.
Oh, get the swordfish. Best swordfish in the city. The best, Jerry.
Hi, Jerry. It's Kenny.
Aw, it's gold, Jerry! Gold! I got all these corporate gigs and even Cynthia took me back.
You think you can give me a hand with my material?
Two Mendys.
But I had the hot dog.
You gonna be home later?
Hey Jerry, where's my suit?
Hey! Hey! (he runs out the door after Simon; from outside) Come Here You!
Ill drop it off. (raps his knuckle twice on the table again, turns and walks away)
Maybe she's right. Maybe I am a complete hack. I'm the absolute worst. The worst, Jerry.
Yeah, Im huge (ducks his head into his right shoulder with false modesty) Well, Ill leave you guys alone. (raps his knuckle twice on the table, turns and walks away)
