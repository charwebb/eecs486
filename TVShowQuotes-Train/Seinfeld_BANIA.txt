Here you go.
(leans backwards from the counter) Yeah!
Why not?
I don't even want anything for it.
I just stopped by to thank you. That risk management stuff you wrote for me? It's killer!
Hey Kramer.
Some woman named Uma. I got her number off of that ticket before it was smudged. Hope she's good-looking. (crosses his fingers in the air)
Yes
Hey Jerry!
42, That's what I am now. I've been working out, Im huge. How'd you like to sell it?
You're supposed to buy me dinner in a nice restaurant, like Mendys.
Hey Jerry.
Ill drop it off. (raps his knuckle twice on the table again, turns and walks away)
[It's K.B., I have the suit]
Yeah, Im huge (ducks his head into his right shoulder with false modesty) Well, Ill leave you guys alone. (raps his knuckle twice on the table, turns and walks away)
I think he's in a good mood.
Kramer, I want my money back for this suit. You're nancy-boy cream leaked all over the pockets -- Suits ruined.
You promised me.
How about that Jerry? First you had a pilot on NBC and now I'll have one. Looks like I'm following you again.
Oh, get the swordfish. Best swordfish in the city. The best, Jerry.
Well all you gotta do is tell Kramer to give me my money back, and you'll get your ticket.
But I don't want anything but soup.
Can we go back to Mendys?
You did?
Hey Jerry, didja see it?
Mmm. This soup is great.
Elaine, where's Kramer?
Ah youre gonna love it. Ill meet you there around 700.
Oh. Jerry, You know what just hit me? I was thinking -- What size suit are you?
Great. I've been working out. Went from a size 40, to a 42.
I start off with curls. That's good for the bicep. (motions with 2 fingers along his right bicep) I do 10 reps, 2 sets.
Wait till you try the swordfish. You know Jerry, I was thinking. For our next meal, do you think we should come here ... or should we go someplace else? You know it has it's pros and cons. On the one hand, here, you're guaranteed a great meal. On the other hand --
Aw, it's gold, Jerry! Gold! I got all these corporate gigs and even Cynthia took me back.
Hey that's the women's dressing room.
Listen Jerry, I've been doing some thinking. I want my suit back.
All right. Ill leave you alone. (turns and walks out the door)
Okay. Okay.
You worn the suit yet?
Im looking for a new suit. I cant find anything I like. That's a nice suit. (admiring Kramers suit)
Hey Jerry, this is Jenna. Pretty good-lookin' huh?
You know, I was thinking if you're not busy, maybe I can get my meal today?
Hey Jerry.
Hey, Jerry! I didn't know you liked soup.
Puke? That's a funny word. Can I use that?
(looking at the ticket then quickly looks up at Jerry) You trying to get out of Mendys? you cant do that.
Ahh.
You're telling me.
Didja hear what happened? The mentor saw my act. She dumped me.
You didnt think I was really going to give you a suit, did you?
Two Mendys.
Im really not comfortable ...
Hey (holds the Armani suit up) Here you go. (walks into the apt.)
Killed. (pause) I'm gonna go pick up some chicks. Good-looking ones, too! (walking away) Hey, what's your name?
What are you talking about? this isn't a meal.
Well it's my suit.
This is lunch in a coffee shop
You worn the suit yet?
It's hard for me to find pants that --
Pretty good.
300 dollars.
I told you Mendys had the best pea soup. The best Jerry, the best. Are you enjoying it?
Thank you, thank you, (To Jerry) Hey, Jerry, did ya see me up there? I was killing, Jerry. Killing. I killed.
100 Bucks
Oh. This is awkward.
Yeah. Well, lets hurry up and eat I gotta get out of here. Im meeting a woman for a drink.
You throw the shirt in?
Hey.
Oh come on. Why should it just sit in the closet?
(reading) Why do they call it Ovaltine? The mug is round. The jar is round. They should call it round tine. That's gold, Jerry! Gold!
How about Mendys, ooh, ever been there?
Ahh, you know what I think. Im just going to have soup. Yeah, Ill save the meal for another time.
Jerry.
Hey, Jerry!! How's it going?! You gonna join us for dinner? The duck here's the best. The best, Jerry.
Ill tell you what -- you can take me out to dinner sometime.
Hey Jerry, where's my suit?
What kind of soup do you have?
OH! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Can I squeeze in? (to George)
Hi. (to Elaine)
I just got a brand new Armani suit -- doesn't fit me anymore. You want it?
What size are you?
Ah, soup and a sandwich for a brand-new Armani suit. Is that any kind of gesture? (turns to George)
Maybe she's right. Maybe I am a complete hack. I'm the absolute worst. The worst, Jerry.
This guy makes the best soup in the city, Jerry. The best. You know what they call him? Soup Nazi.
Hi, Jerry. It's Kenny.
175
But I had the hot dog.
You work out with weights?
That's right, and it's an Armani.
You think you can give me a hand with my material?
Did you get that here?
Ouch.
Hey, I give you a brand-new Armani suit, and you won't even buy me a meal?
