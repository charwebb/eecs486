I had a hot dog earlier. Im not that hungry.
Maybe she's right. Maybe I am a complete hack. I'm the absolute worst. The worst, Jerry.
Yeah, Im huge (ducks his head into his right shoulder with false modesty) Well, Ill leave you guys alone. (raps his knuckle twice on the table, turns and walks away)
Soup's not a meal. You're supposed to buy me a meal.
Aw, it's gold, Jerry! Gold! I got all these corporate gigs and even Cynthia took me back.
Ah youre gonna love it. Ill meet you there around 700.
Listen Jerry, I've been doing some thinking. I want my suit back.
I told you Mendys had the best pea soup. The best Jerry, the best. Are you enjoying it?
What are you talking about? this isn't a meal.
42, That's what I am now. I've been working out, Im huge. How'd you like to sell it?
Great. I've been working out. Went from a size 40, to a 42.
Puke? That's a funny word. Can I use that?
All right. Ill leave you alone. (turns and walks out the door)
Well all you gotta do is tell Kramer to give me my money back, and you'll get your ticket.
I just got a brand new Armani suit -- doesn't fit me anymore. You want it?
Kramer, I want my money back for this suit. You're nancy-boy cream leaked all over the pockets -- Suits ruined.
How about that Jerry? First you had a pilot on NBC and now I'll have one. Looks like I'm following you again.
Wait till you try the swordfish. You know Jerry, I was thinking. For our next meal, do you think we should come here ... or should we go someplace else? You know it has it's pros and cons. On the one hand, here, you're guaranteed a great meal. On the other hand --
Killed. (pause) I'm gonna go pick up some chicks. Good-looking ones, too! (walking away) Hey, what's your name?
Oh come on. Why should it just sit in the closet?
Thank you, thank you, (To Jerry) Hey, Jerry, did ya see me up there? I was killing, Jerry. Killing. I killed.
OH! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Can I squeeze in? (to George)
I start off with curls. That's good for the bicep. (motions with 2 fingers along his right bicep) I do 10 reps, 2 sets.
I just stopped by to thank you. That risk management stuff you wrote for me? It's killer!
You're supposed to buy me dinner in a nice restaurant, like Mendys.
Im looking for a new suit. I cant find anything I like. That's a nice suit. (admiring Kramers suit)
Oh. Jerry, You know what just hit me? I was thinking -- What size suit are you?
Didja hear what happened? The mentor saw my act. She dumped me.
Ahh, you know what I think. Im just going to have soup. Yeah, Ill save the meal for another time.
(looking at the ticket then quickly looks up at Jerry) You trying to get out of Mendys? you cant do that.
Ill drop it off. (raps his knuckle twice on the table again, turns and walks away)
You didnt think I was really going to give you a suit, did you?
Hey Jerry, this is Jenna. Pretty good-lookin' huh?
Ah, soup and a sandwich for a brand-new Armani suit. Is that any kind of gesture? (turns to George)
Hey, I give you a brand-new Armani suit, and you won't even buy me a meal?
Hey (holds the Armani suit up) Here you go. (walks into the apt.)
You think you can give me a hand with my material?
Oh, get the swordfish. Best swordfish in the city. The best, Jerry.
(reading) Why do they call it Ovaltine? The mug is round. The jar is round. They should call it round tine. That's gold, Jerry! Gold!
Some woman named Uma. I got her number off of that ticket before it was smudged. Hope she's good-looking. (crosses his fingers in the air)
Ok, Ill have tomato soup and ah, tuna on toast.
You know, I was thinking if you're not busy, maybe I can get my meal today?
Ill tell you what -- you can take me out to dinner sometime.
This guy makes the best soup in the city, Jerry. The best. You know what they call him? Soup Nazi.
Hey, Jerry! I didn't know you liked soup.
