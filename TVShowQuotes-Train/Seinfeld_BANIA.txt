Hey! Hey! (he runs out the door after Simon; from outside) Come Here You!
Okay. Okay.
Oh. Jerry, You know what just hit me? I was thinking -- What size suit are you?
Puke? That's a funny word. Can I use that?
Hey Jerry, this is Jenna. Pretty good-lookin' huh?
But I don't want anything but soup.
You worn the suit yet?
Hey Jerry, where's my suit?
That's right, and it's an Armani.
Twice? I wanna go twice.
How about Mendys, ooh, ever been there?
Yeah. Well, lets hurry up and eat I gotta get out of here. Im meeting a woman for a drink.
Can we go back to Mendys?
[It's K.B., I have the suit]
I think he's in a good mood.
Hey.
Im looking for a new suit. I cant find anything I like. That's a nice suit. (admiring Kramers suit)
Soup's not a meal. You're supposed to buy me a meal.
Ill tell you what -- you can take me out to dinner sometime.
Ouch.
Elaine, where's Kramer?
Hey Jerry, didja see it?
Kramer.
Hi. (to Elaine)
Did you get that here?
Killed. (pause) I'm gonna go pick up some chicks. Good-looking ones, too! (walking away) Hey, what's your name?
Hey, Jerry! I didn't know you liked soup.
I don't even want anything for it.
This is lunch in a coffee shop
(from outside Monk's) Take It Off!
Hi, Jerry. It's Kenny.
Two Mendys.
(leans backwards from the counter) Yeah!
Well it's my suit.
You did?
Great. I've been working out. Went from a size 40, to a 42.
OH! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Can I squeeze in? (to George)
Oh. This is awkward.
300 dollars.
Hey that's the women's dressing room.
Hey, Jerry!! How's it going?! You gonna join us for dinner? The duck here's the best. The best, Jerry.
Ah, soup and a sandwich for a brand-new Armani suit. Is that any kind of gesture? (turns to George)
You're telling me.
It's hard for me to find pants that --
Hey Jerry.
I had a hot dog earlier. Im not that hungry.
Yes
I told you Mendys had the best pea soup. The best Jerry, the best. Are you enjoying it?
100 Bucks
I start off with curls. That's good for the bicep. (motions with 2 fingers along his right bicep) I do 10 reps, 2 sets.
You work out with weights?
Hey (holds the Armani suit up) Here you go. (walks into the apt.)
Yeah, Im huge (ducks his head into his right shoulder with false modesty) Well, Ill leave you guys alone. (raps his knuckle twice on the table, turns and walks away)
Wait till you try the swordfish. You know Jerry, I was thinking. For our next meal, do you think we should come here ... or should we go someplace else? You know it has it's pros and cons. On the one hand, here, you're guaranteed a great meal. On the other hand --
Jerry.
What are you talking about? this isn't a meal.
But I had the hot dog.
Why not?
What size are you?
Oh, get the swordfish. Best swordfish in the city. The best, Jerry.
Well all you gotta do is tell Kramer to give me my money back, and you'll get your ticket.
How about that Jerry? First you had a pilot on NBC and now I'll have one. Looks like I'm following you again.
(looking at the ticket then quickly looks up at Jerry) You trying to get out of Mendys? you cant do that.
Hey Jerry!
You're supposed to buy me dinner in a nice restaurant, like Mendys.
42, That's what I am now. I've been working out, Im huge. How'd you like to sell it?
This guy makes the best soup in the city, Jerry. The best. You know what they call him? Soup Nazi.
You think you can give me a hand with my material?
(reading) Why do they call it Ovaltine? The mug is round. The jar is round. They should call it round tine. That's gold, Jerry! Gold!
You throw the shirt in?
Pretty good.
Ah youre gonna love it. Ill meet you there around 700.
You gonna be home later?
Ill drop it off. (raps his knuckle twice on the table again, turns and walks away)
Hey, I give you a brand-new Armani suit, and you won't even buy me a meal?
Hey Jerry.
Kramer, I want my money back for this suit. You're nancy-boy cream leaked all over the pockets -- Suits ruined.
Oh come on. Why should it just sit in the closet?
You worn the suit yet?
Maybe she's right. Maybe I am a complete hack. I'm the absolute worst. The worst, Jerry.
You know, I was thinking if you're not busy, maybe I can get my meal today?
I just stopped by to thank you. That risk management stuff you wrote for me? It's killer!
Hey Kramer.
Yeah. You buy me a meal -- you can't get a better deal than that (pats Jerry on the shoulder)
You promised me.
Im really not comfortable ...
175
You didnt think I was really going to give you a suit, did you?
All right. Ill leave you alone. (turns and walks out the door)
Ahh, you know what I think. Im just going to have soup. Yeah, Ill save the meal for another time.
Aw, it's gold, Jerry! Gold! I got all these corporate gigs and even Cynthia took me back.
Some woman named Uma. I got her number off of that ticket before it was smudged. Hope she's good-looking. (crosses his fingers in the air)
